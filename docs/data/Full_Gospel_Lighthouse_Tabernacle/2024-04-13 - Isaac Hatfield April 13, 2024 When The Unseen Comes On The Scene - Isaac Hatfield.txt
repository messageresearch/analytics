just so thankful and have Ella with us as well from the home Church she's she's our Amen Corner back home so we brought her with us and how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen if you have your Bibles we'll turn to the Book of Mark amen chapter 4 just a couple short texts tonight before we go into the word starting verse 35 it says in the same day when the even was was come he saith unto them let us pass over under the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him Master carest thou not that we perish and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm and they said unto them why are you so fearful how is it that you have no faith and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him and one verse in 2 Corinthians 4 verse 18 you don't have to turn there we'll just read it why we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen our Eternal amen if we could bow our heads for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're just so thankful to be in your house once again tonight Lord just to feel your presence sweep into this building father through the worship Lord to know that you thought enough of us just to come into our midst father Lord for you promised where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be in in their midst and father we welcome you Lord in this building tonight father I pray you bless this congregation Lord I I have no ability of a man to speak to their needs but father I pray you just help me to get out of the way Lord that you close my lips to from speaking anything that you wouldn't have to be spoken and Lord I pray you open my lips to speak Lord what the needs would be in this building tonight and even those maybe on the stream that couldn't be here that are Lord that are maybe homesick and things that you just have your way father you just go down the Lord the RADS of of this building and that you just speak to the hearts the lives and we'll be sure to give you all the glory and all the honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated tonight we just want to take a little thought out of those two texts on when the on scene comes on the scene when the on scene comes on the scene and you're all familiar with the the message of course looking at the on scene and brother Brandon preaches this uh uh many times he begins to to lay these thoughts out to us of looking at the onene and how the believer is not looking at things which they see with their natural eyes but you're you're built with a sense of Faith to look at the Unseen and he would tell us that the Unseen things are the real things and he said it's that world of Eternal that we're interested in and he said go down to the store and buy me love and go and buy me a a jar of Joy or or or go and buy personality or go and buy the Holy Spirit he said you won't be able to do it because those are the Unseen things but but he said we put so much emphasis on the natural things that we can see you know we put so much emphasis on our homes and our our vehicles and things at times sometimes people in the world that's the only thing they have as that all the emphasis they have is all on carnal things when those aren't even the real things or the lasting things and the believer's whole Supernatural armor is made up of the Unseen your armor is made up of your joy your peace your armor is Supernatural your walk is Supernatural it's an unseen walk with the Unseen God but we see that the spirit of lead DEA would say that I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and and he said uh I he said but they know not that they're wretched and miserable and poor he said but come and I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire I counsel thee to buy of me rment and I counsel thee to buy of me isaf here he is what a paradox saying he's saying you're poor though you think you're rich with all these world's Goods but come and buy of me how could they come and buy of him when they didn't have any money he just called him poor but he said here's a place you can come without money and without price you can get gold you can get your character you can get the reignment of the word you can come and you can get isab to see the word for your hour he said these are the things that you need to come and buy these things you can buy without money but you you can come to me and I'll give you a pearl of great price I'll give you something that's Eternal something that's lasting amen and that's what we want to put the emphasis on is the things of God the things of that Unseen World for you're you're you're a Creature built up of an outward man and an inward man and and that outward man is that that's yourself that that's your nature your your your carnal man but that inward man is is God and brother Brandon would say that it's a strange thing that man would choose to walk by sight man that was created in the image of God and and when you were created in the image of God it was a spirit man and he only put that Spirit man in this flesh to Habitat this Earth and to go and to plow the Feld that's why he gave you this flesh and those five senses to contact this world but as man begin to grow and Begin to Fall Away From God they begin to put so much emphasis on that on that carnal man on that outward man and begin to walk by that outward man in its senses and forgot to walk by that inward man which is the real you but brother BR say when you walk by that outward man you and you walk by sight you actually Rob the inward man you rob that real you of the things of God because that's what matters to the believer that's what matters to to us tonight is that that we would come in contact with something that would that would hold you a keeping power that would keep you in the trials that would keep you in the low times in the High Times in the dark times and if all you ever get in life is just a a build up of material things then it'll be a it'll be a fleeting thing and what would be the value of that but we've come with an interest tonight to get a hold of something Eternal to begin to tap into that Unseen World where we could begin to realize that God is in the room and all things are possible and he's the same yesterday today and forever and you begin to lay all those other senses aside and you begin to let that sick sense of Faith which is that real you to begin to come into contact with the word of God and begin to pull on that word of God and say it's for me the promise is for me and you begin to walk by that instead of your your your own feelings oh you you can walk in your own way but God will let you walk alone he'll let you just go he'll let you can walk with a thousand friends in your own way and walk without God and be as alone as you could be but if the only friend you have in this world is Jesus then I say walk with Jesus walk with the Lord walk with this message and he'll be your friend he'll be your God he'll walk you through these scriptures he'll give you eyes to have to see he'll give you the things of Eternal value oh and it'll be worth it all not to walk by your own mind but let this mind which is in Christ Jesus be in you but I'm I'm so thankful that God provided a way to look at the Unseen how could Jesus as a as a Nazarene Carpenter tell them that you were just on the other side of the mountain I saw you praying under a tree How could a lowly man that was born and he walked in flesh like you and me how could he know these things but he was endued with the power to look at the Unseen but God did not just limit that to to Jesus Christ but he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he said I'm going to give you a way that you can be endued with a power that you'll have another sight to walk by you won't have to walk by your natural sight anymore but I'll give you a spiritual sight you'll be able to see the kingdom of God and to see the kingdom of God is not to look upon it with your eyes but brother Bron said it's to understand I'll give you the ability to understand my kingdom I'll give you the ability to understand my word and my promises in this hour oh and then they would come in the Book of John and say he that heareth my word and believeth on him that s me shall not perish but has everlasting life and you shall not come in the Judgment brother Brandon would say that word hearing doesn't necessarily mean to hear for many could hear and walk away but that hear means to understand to him that understandeth my word because many could hear and walk away and they have nothing to believe with there's nothing in them to believe this word with but there's something about you you've been indued with another power that you have the ability to hear you have the ability to see and blessed are your eyes if they hear this word and blessed are your ears if you have the ability to understand this word you see we don't walk by sight we don't walk by our hearing and many say you know brother Brandon would give us the example that that people say seeing is believing and he would say oh come upon the stage and do you hear that music he said do you see that music no you don't you hear it so how could seeing be believing and he would begin to lay in these examples how those five senses of your natur man we not believing but he would say understanding is believing when you understand the promise of God it brings a faith into your heart that you can walk and you can persevere and you can hold on to that promise because he said except a man be born again you cannot see the kingdom of God you have to accept it by faith but then when God drops it in your heart brother there comes an understanding and that's the way the same way he said you believe for healing you just take an understanding of this scripture and you begin to hold on to that and that understanding is what you walk by because your natural sight May declare a lot of things to you your symptoms may be up and down your feelings may be up and down but that understanding doesn't change that understanding in your heart is steadfast for it's built on the word of God and you have a right to walk with that understanding and God has made a way that through a new birth brother you could be a candidate for association with this on scen world automatically you don't just have an outward anymore but there's an inward man that believes you're associated with the promise of God you're associated with the Supernatural and he's given you an understanding that you could say I understand by my sight that there's a lot of problems going on right now I understand that in this church tonight that there's situations that you could try to touch W with your natural man and you would ruin them and they would fall apart I understand that there's sickness that the doctors have have no ability to heal that there's complexes and tormenting spirits that we can never deliver with her own ability but because I have another understanding I believe that there is a God that could come into this building tonight and I understand that every sick person could leave here healed I understand that every bound person possessed by the devil could leave here free as can be I understand that there is a God that could come on the scene and turn everything around oh and that's what I'm walking by tonight I'm not look and what I see with my eyes I'm not leaning to my own understanding because if I lean to my own understanding would be in the pits tonight but I'm leaning on the understanding of the word of God that all things are possible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's still a Healer he's still a deliverer he still sets the captive free oh and by this word I understand that I don't have to understand I don't have to understand everything in my own ability I don't have to understand what you're going through I don't have to understand your family history to know that God's a deliverer that God's A Healer that God can break that cycle that you've been living in for days and weeks oh you find yourself in the night hours desperate for a touch but I understand that there is a God that we serve that can come on the scene in this building tonight and end that thing oh that's what you believe with it's understanding aren't you thankful for understanding oh there's a lot of power and understanding for brother Brandon would tell us that that Maniac of gadera was so possessed by the devil that he didn't even have his own understanding anymore and if that would work in the negative what about the positive that a people could be so possessed by the holy spirit that you would lose your own understanding and begin to step into that Unseen World and say God I'm not going to walk that way anymore but I'm going to look at the promise and I'm going to press the battle because I understand that it's finished at Calvary the blood that you shed already paid the price I don't have to live in this bondage anymore the prison Gates have been open oh and when God calls you oh you may feel like an eagle in a cage but God's calling over your life open that door to let you out and if you hear that word calling you to a higher plane tonight you can recognize that the door's open and all you got to do is fly out oh by the promise of the word that's what we're looking at God's A Healer oh his word is the same yesterday today and forever oh I know that Devil's a liar and he'll try to get in your ear and Whisper to you those lies but he's the father of Lies but there is a truth of this word oh and don't let the LIE of the devil be your limit but let this word be your limit and if this word says there's a higher place to go than brother go ahead and climb into those higher places by the understanding of your inward man oh it's a finished work oh he's given us another sight and that's how we're walking tonight you know the testimony of John Ryan how he was blind and he went through the prayer line and brother brandom prayed over him and he went about thinking that he was healed oh he came back to that prayer line again he said brother random I'm still blind I thought you said I was healed he said well I thought you said you believed oh and then he left that place and he be to testify extra extra Read All About It by his stripes I'm Healed oh nothing changed with his natural lies but some sort of understanding must have dropped down in his heart to realize that it's finished and he began to testify of the finished work oh because he was walking by an understanding oh it's with the eyes of God that you look for Jeremiah said hear now this oh fool people and without understanding which have eyes and see not and have ears and hear not so it's possible to have eyes and ears and not understand but then Paul said that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened you may know what is the hope of his calling and the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints oh that's the understanding that we're interested in tonight oh I I would rather have the eyes of my understanding opened than my natural eyes any day of the week oh that's the vision that we're interested in and there's so much power in it that the woman at the well one day could say I perceive that you're a prophet I I understand that you're a prophet and we've heard that there's a messiah coming we've heard these things but he would begin to tell her that it was he that it was he that was the Messiah it was he that they were looking for and brother when she got that understanding she went into the City and said come see a man oh that knows the very thoughts of your heart come see a messiah isn't this he that we've been looking for oh when she got an understanding oh it brought a liberty into her life and when you see this message as as more than a man as more than as more than William brandom or or it's more than just a bunch a bunch of books and tapes but when you see this message as Jesus Christ on Earth again veiled in in another mask and brother it'll produce a liberty it'll produce a freedom in your life because it's an understanding and and if you don't have the right understanding then you'll go off into all kinds of uh of battles and hardships but but I I believe that the Lord tonight is gracious and and I believe the Lord could bring such an understanding in this building tonight of of who he is of the Pres revelation of his presence here in our midst the the fact that he's a Healer not just a Healer but your Healer not just a deliverer but your deliverer not just a savior but your savior I pray that Spirit of Revelation would just strike strike our hearts it makes you realize why brother Brandon would say the necessity to pray for Revelation uh how necess how necessary that is for that's what will give you an ability to walk talk with the word of God it's through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made by things which do appear and if you don't understand something what can help you understand at times is to focus you know if you're reading a book sometimes I read a book and and I'll be reading I I'll be several Pages down and I'll be like man I I I can't remember anything I just read you'll be halfway through the chapter and you'll have no clue what you just read and you're all right I'm going to have to focus or else I'm going to miss the understanding of what's being said and so you start to focus and brother Brandon would say in Victory day that God invites man to look but man wants to look his own way and God's trying to get man to look at that innocent substitute but he says they finally look but they fail to focus right and and they pick up the binoculars of that word and they start looking and he would give us the example that sometimes you can look through binocular and see uh maybe three deers standing out in the field when really there's only one deer out there and so he said you got to focus right and and you'll see that there's only one deer is that they would pick up the word but they would fail to focus right and and they'd have two Lords and three gods and and all kinds of things out there that are contrary to the word uh when the word says there's one Lord one faith and and one baptism and so he said there's a focus that you can come to in the word and Eve and Eve when she listened to the LIE of that serpent uh it brought another Focus to her mind that was contrary to the word and where they used to be one way now there was two ways and and she began to walk in two ways and and the Bible tells us how can two walk together except they be agreed and and so she broke Fellowship in that Garden of Eden and and you know the story but but but God has provided a way that you could come back to the word and you could say what the word says and I just believe that if if the Lord spoke it then we have a right to focus on it tonight we have a right to focus on every promise we have a right to focus on on everything that he said we could have and and I I believe if you're sick tonight you have a right to take us hold of that scripture and begin to focus on it and as you focus on it it'll begin to come more real it'll begin to drop into your heart if you need the Holy Ghost young person you can begin to focus on that promise and you can begin to push out all those other opinions that it's not for for you uh that you're too young or that you're too old or or or that you're too far gone that that that that you're not able to receive it but you begin to focus in on that word and and there's a power in that Focus for brother Brandon brother Brandon was a prophet and and he was also a hunter and he would take a hold of that Winchester rifle that he had and he would go out there and he could drive a tack at 50 yards Time After Time After Time but he come to the place one time where that r begin to shoot off and so he be to wonder well well what's wrong with this rifle what's wrong and he began to get so tormented by it you know why because because he had seen that rifle shoot in the same spot time after time at 50 yards now those other brothers could walk out and they could shoot that squirrel in the body they could shoot it in the leg they could shoot it in the foot they could do whatever they wanted and not be bothered by it but this so bothered the prophet that that he found himself laying under a tree weeping saying Lord why did you send me here why did you send me into these meetings why am I like this and he found himself in a state of depression because the rifle wouldn't shoot the way it should have and he began to God began to reveal to him that as that he made him that way for a purpose because he would get up behind that pulpit and he wouldn't just get up and preach something just by an unction of his own mind but he would lay in those scriptures and he would lay in that word until he knew exactly what it meant until he knew exactly what the revelation of it was and he delivered onto us a focused message that we would have something to look at oh and he knew that it would do it he had seen how in the book of Acts they had got a hold of that word and believed it until it produced a mighty Ministry of men and woman who who could who could manifest the very life of Jesus Christ and he said I've seen it do it so I know if I just get focused right it'll do it again I've seen this Winchester shoot and even though the maker of the God says it's not going to do it I've seen it do it and I know it'll do it again oh and he said I've seen this word do it and sometimes that's what where we find ourselves you find yourselves kneeling before the Lord saying Lord what's wrong why does my life not seem to be manifesting what I know it can but there's something about you that you know if you ever get your life focused right it'll manifest the word for your hour it'll manifest Jesus Christ on Earth again and so you Toil and you labor and you say Lord take it out of me Lord take this this this carnal nature out of me oh and you're getting your life in a focus because you know the power of this word you know what it can do you've seen it do it in others and you say Lord I know if it worked for others it'll work for me this word can be manifested in my life oh and maybe sometimes that's why you find yourself in a state of tension and you think something's wrong with you maybe a young person tonight sometimes you you battle with that nervousness and that tension and maybe it's not not a bad thing but God sometimes allow tension in your life because that's what keeps you in line that's what keeps you in line with your the with the word of God that's what keeps you constantly checking up with that word saying Lord am I lining up right am I focused right focused right oh so don't don't let the devil beat you up on that all the time amen because God may be using it but aren't you thankful we have something to focus on are you thankful for a word we can focus on you know there was was up at Mount Transfiguration one time and there was a three men up on that mountain Peter James and John and they represented hope faith and charity and there they were on that mountain and they were on that mountain with the holy God and there they were looking and there he was there was God on that mountain shining his reignment were shining and there they were and all of a sudden Moses and Elijah appeared and they represented Law And Justice and there was Jesus representing God's love and so Peter got all excited he said let's build three Tabernacles because of this special moment and there they were getting ready to build three Tabernacles but but the thing is that that Moses represented the law and the law was only a policeman that could put us in jail and Justice would would only judge your life a and so they were trying to build a tabernacle but God had other plans and before they could build that Tabernacle there come down a cloud and there come out a voice that spoke this is my beloved Son hear ye him and Peter James and John looked again and they didn't see Moses and Elijah anymore but they saw Jesus only that's the only one they saw when they got focused right and that's the problem sometimes people come into this message and all they see is a bunch of Law and a bunch of justice and so they fall away and they go back into the world say no it's just a bunch of rules and regulations but they didn't stay long enough to look at the main attraction and if you could just look again tonight you'll see more than a law you'll see more than justice but you'll see the love of God reaching out and picking up his attributes out of this Earth and showing them who they are showing you where you came from showing you that you were always a part of God oh you have a right tonight to look again maybe you've looked at this message sometimes oh and all it was was your parents' religion but look again look again and see Jesus only look again and see this message is Christ revealed in this hour oh what is the attraction on the mountain brother Gabriel God is fulfilling his word God was fulfilling his word up on that that that Mount Olive when Jesus come riding down on that white donkey it was God fulfilling Zechariah 9 and God has been fulfilling his word and when Moses was up on that mountain God was fulfilling his word and he was attracting Moses to something but it was more than a sign but Moses was attracted by the sign and there begin to come a voice out of that sign calling them to his purpose oh and there's been a lot of signs but God doesn't just send signs for no reason he sends signs to attract a crowd and when that crowd is there there comes a voice that speaks a message oh and you were attracted to this message maybe some of you Elders come in in The Healing Ministry but you stuck around long enough to look again and see that there was a voice speaking out of that message calling you out calling you out of denomination calling you out of man-made Creeds and dogmas and brother it attracted your attention that's what we're attracted to tonight oh brother Brandon preached the message what is the attraction he said I got the inspiration when I was driving down the street this morning and I saw the license plates from all the different states he said they come from the east and west but there's something about the believer you can't help but follow it you can't help but follow this word is that you can take my life but you can't take this this word attracts the bride you've been attracted to more than the pews more than the color of the carpet you've been attracted to God fulfilling his word in your day to the Fulfillment of Revelation 107 in Luke 17:30 and brother when Moses was walking down that path he was attracted by that by that burning bush and when he was attracted to that Burning Bush whatever he was doing that day brother Gabriel he was distracted he was distracted by from whatever he was doing and his only attraction was that burning bush and sometimes brother when you're attracted to something it distracts you from everything else and some of you when you were out in the world you were attracted to sports so much that it distracted you from everything else you might have been attracted to car so much that it distracted you from everything else you might have found your girlfriend one day and you were so attracted to that it distracted you from everything else they said oh where where's Gabriel been lately oh I don't know he's distracted again I haven't heard from him in weeks and months because he's found his mate oh but brother one day your mate the revealed word begin to come in front of your eyes and you become attracted to it and it distracted you from every other voice every other opinion every other Creed every other dogma and you begin to focus say oh I've got something to focus son now oh it's God manifesting his word in our midst oh it's an attraction to the bride this word calls you out and that's what you have a right tonight to do is look again you see that's what we're talking about when we're talking about looking on at to to the onse scene it's that that that you've got to not focus on the symtoms but you got to focus on the word like Jonah could be in the belly of the well and he could asking Well's belly to the left to the right I see Well's belly in front of me and behind me but he said yet once more will I look again and he looked again he said I see by faith there's a Temple that was dedicated and they said if you would pray the prayer of faith that God would deliver you and so he called it a lying vanity and he looked again and if you're looking at your symptoms brother you'll constantly be living into feet but you have a right to look again and say I see Jesus on a cross I see his hands nailed I see blood dripping out of his side blood for my healing and blood for my salvation and I see Isaiah picking up a pen and riding he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed there's a lot of power sometimes and taking another look cuz the first look might be your inward your outward man but take another look by that inward man and see Jesus see Jesus only in this message see the promise of the word oh sometimes you got to take another look oh and focus on that you see and then you have a right to call those things which be not as though they are you have a right to call that devil a liar tonight you have a right like Abraham to say I may not see it I may not understand it but I'm going to call it a as though it already is I'm going to call those symptoms as though they're not and I'm going to call my healing as though it is you see sometimes brother and sister it it takes an it takes something on your part and and sometimes that's why we testify before it's ever done because because brother Brown taught us that works is Faith expressed and he began to lay in this thought that that that that Paul wrote about Abraham that he was justified by faith and and he said how could it be when when James wrote about him that he was justified by works but he said it's not a contradiction it's just that faith and works are husband and wife and when Abraham believed God that's what God saw in him but when he went to acting as though it was done that's what man saw and our works express our faith in this word and as you begin to as God begins to reveal to you something then brother it's a finished work a and when God drops something in your heart now not just a hope so but a know so when he drops that in your heart like he did for Abraham then you have a right to make ready for it you see Abraham why didn't Abraham just wait until the the pregnancy test came back positive to go out and buy the little booties and the crib and the blankets because there's something about faith and works that are married together that when Faith drops in your heart you can express the works of it and those Works God already recognized his faith so why would he have to do the works so that man could see the kind of faith that he had and it's a powerful thing to me because brother Brandon would pray for a baby that had clubbed feet and he would pray for him and those club feet were still clubbed when he left the service but the next day I believe it was he went down to the shoe store and he saw daddy in there picking out shoes what was it oh God may have already seen his faith but brother brandom as a man could walk in and see his Works expressing his faith he said why would why would Mariah Pro it had to take her bobby pins in the prayer line one night for your healing did not God already see your faith that maybe so but all the rest of us that were there saw the works expressing her faith oh and I'm so glad that brother Brandon didn't teach us that works is feelings expressed but he taught us that works is Faith expressed because sometimes your works are not expressing your feelings but your works are expressing your faith oh why are you here tonight you had to take work to get here is that an expression of your feelings or was that an expression of Faith oh there was an old man one time that was deaf dumb and blind he said why do you come to church oh because I just want the devil and everybody else to know that I believe this oh and sometimes that may be the only reason you come to church because God may already see your faith but sometimes you just need to let the devil and everybody know that your works are still expressing that you believe God that you believe he's a Healer that's you believe he the deliverer oh you can go to praising him in the midst of Trials because sometimes your praise is not an expression of your feelings but sometimes your worship is an expression of only your faith because you may not see it you may not understand it with your natural lies but there's some sort of understanding that says it's for me and so you begin to praise in the Lord you begin to Worship in the Lord because you're expressing something in that Unseen World that God is here in our midst oh you say brother Isaac if I can only express to you all the problems that I'm going through oh go ahead I'll listen but after you're done let's Express how big our God is let's Express how he's a Healer let's Express how he's done it before and he'll do it again oh what are you expressing oh i' say if this church was expressing their feelings I would tune in on Saturday night and say here brother Andrew saying oh problems problems lots and lots of problems but this church must have found another thing to express because when you tune in you still got the Victory you still got your shout you still got your dance you must have found another way to express because you say oh oh did they get a good report is all the trials over no brother Ron actually just had a heart attack didn't you hear then how are they happy then how are they Victorious because they're expressing something that's dropped in from that Unseen World is that God is God and God don't ever change and so if he kept them this far he can take them all the way through oh you have a right to express it oh you're not expressing your feeling you say I feel like a hypocrite brother Isaac oh sometimes you just have to take that adopted child and just go to thanking the Lord he say I don't feel like I have the Revelation just yet well just keep thanking him for it just keep praising him for it just take that adopted child sometimes and before you know it God and His grace and mercy begin to drop something down into your heart and oh there it is now I I can express it from my heart oh your Works express your faith you say the only thing if you're expressing your thoughts and the only thing you can express is problems and situations then you need to get your focus right and do what Paul said think on these things that which is good that which is lovely that which is of a good report sometimes you just got to change your expression sometimes you just got to turn that round upside down in the natural that would be great and in the spiritual and change what you're expressing and live a Victorious Life oh why is it so hard to live the Christian Life oh sometimes you're looking at the wrong thing but you get that Focus back right brother and you can begin to express oh and it's a paradox the world don't understand it why you can be so Victorious why you can persevere in the midst of hard times but it's because you're looking at the Unseen you're expressing because you're considering not you're considering not like Abraham the deadness of Sarah's womb or the deadness of your own body consider not the circumstances brother when God has dropped something in your heart you'll no longer consider the circumstances but you'll consider the promise alone and that's what you'll walk by and and if and and and and I believe that applies to the spiritual but even in the natural maybe there's somebody that that's considered the deadness in their own womb and that's all that they can see and it weighs on you night and day because all you want is a baby and and this begins to come on my heart as I begin to study this consider not the deadness of Sarah's womb and I think God has given us given us so many testimonies of God restoring life to the womb we have a little niece at home Evelyn that was a product of a miracle where God gave a baby to a family that was in desperate conditions we have testimony back home there's testimonies around this world uh brother tusher down in Louisiana brother and sister Jackson in North Carolina because that's if you can look at where God's done it before you know he's the same yesterday today and forever and you know it can do it again and consider that consider the promise consider the testimonies and look not at the deadness of your womb look not at the deadness of your situation and consider the word you see David could go into battle and he wasn't considering cuz cuz Goliath could look at him how old are you young man 10 years old Goliath could look at little David and Goliath could say oh he's he he's nothing but a youth and he's just a young man and Goliath Goliath considered his youth said he's a young man he's no threat to me but David didn't consider his Youth and I think that you young people tonight the devil may be telling you that because you're a young person that you don't have access to the blessings that the rest of the church does but I think you can come to a place where you don't consider you youth but Paul said let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example and I believe God can raise up young people to be examples examples of Purity examples of righteousness examples of the message examples of faith in the word of God God can raise up young people who won't consider their youth God can raise up Elders who won't consider their age and make you pillars in the house of God and break up those complexes from your life that everybody's forgotten you nobody cares about you stop considering the age and only consider the promise and begin to rise into your adopted position of who you are and who God's called you to be oh if he still has you here he must still have a purpose for you so you don't have to live in the dumps of depression and inferiority you can rise in the promises of God oh he say what's the evidence that it's going to happen faith is the evidence say don't see it that's not the evidence faith is the evidence faith is an act of positive faith is a finished work oh and you can act on that Faith because we don't walk by sight but we walk by faith you see that's how Abraham could persevere was because he walked by faith and not by sight you know that's that's what brother Brandon would tell us about those old hot and tots he said they serve the the god of amoya it's the Unseen God he said but but a Christian just a Christian just doesn't have to see something to believe it he said he said that that Christians don't have to see to believe and he even said about these hot and tots that they have to see it to believe it he said that's idolatry he said to have to see something to worship it that's idolatry but as Believers we don't have to wait till we see it to worship God he said here these word these hot and tots they would worship the god of amoya until they got into a hard situation and they would pack around that Idol on their hip to break out in the tough times but we are not Idol worshippers but we worship the invisible God in the good times and in the tough times you don't have to see it to believe it you don't have to see it to worship it but there's something in you that worships whether you see it or not because even when you don't see it he may be working even when you don't feel it he may be moving on the scene and sometimes you get so focused on the flesh Veil that brother the that the Lord could be trying to do something in the church and all you can see is the man and all you can see is your sister and all you can see is your brother and so you don't receive what God's trying to do but look again brother and see the Unseen God in this church this is more than a gathering of individuals this is a gathering of Sons and Daughters of God and you can look again and realize that God is speaking over this Pulpit on Sundays and Saturdays and God maybe trying to do something in your life if you could just stop looking at the flesh Veil and realize that God uses man in this hour God has no hands but ours God has no feet but ours he has no tongue but ours he has no ability but he he would express it through his bride oh he has ability he he he could he could work without me but he chose in this hour to to to to express himself through a bride and sometimes that's where we get caught as that traditional Veil but if you could ever break through that traditional Veil that it has to come the way you think and it has to come the way you desire and just let God be God let the god that we serve be God tonight and you begin to break away every traditional Veil you begin to break away every box of your own idea you begin to break away every situation and just say God if you want to do something in my life have your way oh Lord not my will but thine be done oh that's the god that we serve oh he has so much ability but maybe sometimes we just try to let him do it our way instead of his way Lord help us tonight but but God has given us a way to persevere and in Hebrews it says choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God it's talking about Moses enduring he said then to enjoy the pleasures of sin sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible when I read that that just so struck my heart that the very Foundation of Moses's endurance was that he saw something that was Invisible Man think about that for a second the very Foundation of his walk was that he looked and something was invisible and it gave him perseverance and that doesn't maybe compute with the natural mind but I I went over and looked at the Amplified and it said by faith he left Egypt being unafraid of the Wrath of the king for he endured steadfastly as seeing him who is unseen so here you find that if you can just begin to look at the on scene that can bring a perseverance in your life for Moses said I would choose rather to suffer Affliction H with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and he had something about him I would rather suffer I would rather suffer with those uh Hebrews out in the mud pits than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and if you're living in for the pleasures of sin then then it'll be a very short season and The Season's almost over but Moses had a different way to look he was looking at the on scene and he said I would rather choose to suffer Affliction I would rather take the trials and the hard times I would rather walk with God in the midst of difficulty than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season and it brought an endurance in his life and he said I would rather esteem the reproach and I esteem it Greater riches than the treasures of Egypt he could look out there at the palace of pharaoh he could see the king and the kingship he could see the throne he could see great years ahead uh if he would go down that road but he could look farther than that and see in the future that Egypt would be in Desolation but he looked farther and he said though I see the future of Egypt he was looking out the same window that Pharaoh looked at but he saw something different he saw Christ in those mud pits and those men he said I'm not ashamed to regard my position as a Hebrew instead of an Egyptian I'm not ashamed to be one of them I'm not ashamed to take on the reproach of a Hebrew I'm not ashamed to be called a children of Israel I'm not ashamed to suffer I'm not ashamed to take on the reproach because he could look out that window and he could see the future of Egypt may have been bright for a few years but that's all it was but he could look and he could see the children of Israel gathered around the throne with faithful Abraham and that's what he looked at and by looking at the on scene you can realize tonight that America will be blown into craters and Ashes but you look a little farther and you see the bride gathered around the Throne of God God and that brings an endurance in your life that brings a perseverance in your life he said I would rather look to those greater Treasures than the treasures of Egypt and Moses looked out that window brother and he didn't just sympathize with them and say oh those are great people my those Hebrews are wonderful people my I sure appreciate them I'm going to go back to my nice comfy chair no he worked out that window and he said I want I'm going to become one of them I'm not ashamed to regard my place in those mud pits I'm not ashamed to take on the name of Christianity and bear the reproach of it because I see past it that there's coming a reward and brother brandom could choose the harder way but it was God's way and God could say there's a great portion of Heaven that awaits you little bride you that persevere you that look to the on scene keep pressing keep pressing the battle you see I could come and admonish you as a human being but if you could look to that on scene and see those hosts of saints that have gone on before you telling you to persevere keep pressing the battle it won't be long now keep pressing persevere don't look back don't look to the left or to the right Joshua stay with the commission stay with the word oh and brother brand would say what could be a greater treasure than the new birth and there's something about the believer he's not ashamed to be called a Believer he's not ashamed of the new birth he's not ashamed of when the on scene comes on the scene and begins to speak to his heart and drop a revelation out of that mystical Channel and begin to reveal to him who he is and where he came from and where he's going he's not ashamed of the effects of the Unseen World that'll make him weep and cry and Shout Moses wasn't ashamed Moses Moses was willing to esteem the reproach greater treasure and there's something I'm willing I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed to take on the reproach of this message I can consider it a greater treasure you could cut off my head you could kill me but whether I die or whether I live there's something about you that says I'm not going to quit I'm not going to back up I'm not going to give up or whether I get persecuted and made fun of or laughed at there's something about me I'm looking to something else I'm looking to the on scene that God has got a bride and to know that he loves me to know that he's proud of me for staying with his word to know that he loves me enough to send me a message there's something in my heart that says Lord I'll receive it I'll keep it pure as long as you give me Grace I'll stand for it I won't back down I won't be ashamed of this Holy Ghost I won't be ashamed of any word in this Bible I won't be ashamed of anything that brother brandom taught oh I'm focused on this message I've been attracted to it and all other distractions have gone aside I'm not looking to the right or to the left I'm looking to the Unseen I'm looking to Heaven brother I'm looking to Eternity with God I'm looking to a Rapture I'm looking to a millennium I'm looking to a future home and it won't come to a bunch of hybrid uh halfway Christians but it's coming to a people who are willing to persevere who are willing to believe God and take him out his word oh that's what it is it's calling you to a higher plane calling you to perseverance by looking at the on scene and remember remember who you're walking with you're not walking with with the with a with a with just a a a a God that's that's just shows up on Sundays and Saturdays and and just a God that's just painted pretty and a in a church somewhere but you're walking with the Unseen one you're walking with the one that Abraham walked with you're walking with the one that Enoch walked with you're walking with the one that Adam and Eve walked with you're walking with him and he's the Unseen guest he's the Unseen guest in our homes he's the Unseen guest in his services oh there's a lot going on in that Unseen World that we don't always realize there's Angels encamped about those that fear Him oh but sometimes you may not see it but God saw fit one time to show gazi and open his eyes Elijah was used to walking by the Unseen so he knew they were there but one time in Dothan God opened gazi's eyes and he could see the host of unseen forces all around him there's Angels encamped about us oh that's not just something that we say that's not just something that we pray over our children at night that's something that we believe that's something that we live by that's something that if you really believe it you can believe that they follow you to your car when you go to work you can believe that they watch over your children when they lay down to sleep and when they go to school oh in that Unseen World it's more real than anything you see with your natural lie and brother Brown said one day it'll become just as common as television because television was always there but it took something to pick it up and channel it he said one day these things will become just as common it'll become just as common to see angels as it is to watch the television it'll become just as common to see your loved ones appear among you as it will be to turn on a light switch one of these days that Unseen World will become so close it'll become just as common as what you see with your natural eye oh but I don't believe we have to wait until then I believe because you're a candidate for it it be can become to start becoming now it can become more common to you now it can become more common for angels to visit your home than television shows it can become more common for you to get down on your knees and pray for the situation than to pick up the phone and gossip about it it can become more common for you to begin to connect with that Unseen World you're a candidate for it but sometimes it loses its commonness but look back to the Unseen and let this word become common to you let the power of God become common to you oh you may have lost the joy of your salvation it may not mean you're not saved but the commonness has left you but I pray God restore joy in your heart tonight that it'll become just as common as it ever was for you to feel the presence of God for you to feel the promises of God encouraging your heart oh you say I've been coming to church for a long time brother Isaac and I just haven't felt the Lord but I pray God let the commonness of that Unseen World be restored in your life oh and you may not always see it but may you feel that it's there may you feel that God's with you he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you Lo I'll be with you always never forget who's in that ship with you brother oh you say I don't see it all I see is a mud ship but oh if you're a Believer tonight I see more than a mud ship I see Christ in the mud ship and when the on scene comes on the scene brother things can change things can turn around oh may it become common to us that you're walking with the Unseen one and you may say tonight we would see Jesus that's what we're talking about we're talking about that unseen one Jesus there was some in the Bible one time that said we would see Jesus and there was philli and Andrew there were some disciples that said all right and they confir get conferred together and they begin to take them to Jesus and they had a desire to see him but they didn't just want to know where he lived they didn't just want to know what he at for supper that said we want to see Jesus and to know him as life we want to see him we want to see Jesus and and so those disciples Andrew and Phillip they took him into the presence of Jesus and there he was and he didn't say oh yeah you finally recognized it I'm the man this is my I'm the Messiah this is my kingdom that I'm building welcome to welcome to to the great domain that that I'm building but he said except a corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it won't live again he said if you want to see me it's going to require death you're going to have to die out to yourself he was speaking of something he was speaking of Calvary he was speaking of a place that you could come and you could see Jesus but it wouldn't come through a Creed it wouldn't come through religion it would come to dying out to yourself and being born again and becoming a candidate that God would give you eyes to see say we would see Jesus all right except corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it'll abide alone he was speaking of Calvary for he said if I live for myself then that'll be the end of it but if I die and if I go and plant my corn of weed in the ground it'll bring forth a a hundred and if you plant a 100 it'll bring forth a thousand and so there was Jesus there he was in their midst he said but I've got to plant this corn of wheat in the ground and he is speaking also of his church that there would come forth a first church and it would be wonderful but he was going to have to plant it in the ground through through the Dark Ages that it would rise again and be restored in this last age because there was going to be a people in this last age that would desire to see him and says I'm going to plant my church in the ground but I'm not going to leave it there I'm going to let it rise and one of these days I'm going to have a group of people it's a ye class of people that will see me brother BR said I believe we can see him he said if those disciples could take them to him in that hour they can do it today he said I believe we can see him but Jesus Christ come on the earth and brother his first coming there he was he he was he was born after he was he was born after that Spirit nature God was a spirit but he thought it not robbery to to be equal with God but he also thought it not not unfitting to take on the form of a man and so he took that Spirit man and he put it inside of that flesh man and there was John the Baptist on the scene at the time and identified him and said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world you see he's an invisible God but he come and he took on and Jesus Christ became the image of the invisible God he became God in Mor and John the Baptist under the spirit of Elijah identified him here is that lamb you see he's an invisible God but he's an identified God he's an identified Christ throughout all ages he was identified in the pillar of fire he was identifi identified in the shukan glory and so here he was and though he was persecuted and laughed at and made fun of he was fulfilled ing every scripture that was spoken over him the lame walked the blind saw the deaf heard the dead were raised again here was Jesus Christ in flesh fulfilling the word and there was a group of people that recognized him there was a Peter that recognized he was the Christ there was a woman at the well that recognized him there was Nathaniel that recognized him there was a group of people that recognized him and he said oh but I've got to go plant this corn of wheat in the ground but I will not leave you comfortless I will come again onto you the world won't see me anymore but ye shall see me and he begin to tell us that there would be a ye class of people that there would be a ye class in every age in every generation those that would desire to see him those that would have eyes to see he said the world won't see me that's the unbeliever you could put me right in front of them and they still won't see me but there will be a group of ye there will be a group of people who aren't interested in politics and churchianity and a bunch of rules but they're interested in seeing Jesus they've got a desire I want to see him and it said ye shall see me I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again unto you and I'll be with you even in you oh and here he came and here he came and he said I'll be with you and here comes his second coming he sent back a spirit on the day of Pentecost and he buried that corn of wheat through the Dark Ages but here he comes to his second coming and God once again becomes in morphe and in morphe means that the Unseen was made visible so that you could could see it it was God invisible but he took on the form of something so that we could understand it so that we could see it oh and there was a group of people that saw him in Jesus but he said oh I'm coming on the scene again in a bride body and I'm going to be God in Moray again I'm going to change my mask but there will be a group of ye that are going to see me and there is a bride on the Earth today that is the image of the invisible God because we had an Elijah that stood here on this Earth say who is that man standing between me and the sister that tells her where she lives and what's wrong with her it was more than brother brandom there was an unseen one that had come in the midst of the Church of the Living God and brother brandham could stand there and identify who is this MDC he could identify him in the pillar of fire he could identify him in the cloud and say that's my Lord up there and then he could turn around and say the word wants to be made flesh in your flesh and I identify Jesus Christ he deity is not in heaven but deity is in you and Brother brandom come on the scene and identified Jesus Christ is here again on the scene in a bride body oh he's picked up flesh again there brother brandom stood and he said when Jesus come on the scene three stars aligned declaring the birth of an infant king of an infant savior but in 1962 he declared five stars have just aligned what's it declaring it's declaring that there's an infant bride on the earth there is a bride I have a tabernacle they're going to be the image of the invisible God oh but what was he doing he said just like Dothan just like Elijah at Dothan there had to be a change of seeing I'm saying I'm trying to get to you to see that the god that always was still is that the God that was in the Old Testament Jehovah of the old is Jesus in the new he said I'm trying to get the people to see that he's still here that he's the same yesterday today and forever that you can still see him that you can still know him that you can still walk with him and talk with him that you can still fellowship with him it's it's Elohim materializing in his attributes and I believe that I'm one of those attributes I believe that you're one of those attributes and Elohim begin to condescend and materialize in his attributes so that this message could be more than with us this message can be in you oh this message can live inside of you this message can be tabernacled in hearts and lives today and you're a candidate for association with the Rapture you're a candidate for association with the third poll you're a candidate for association with that Unseen World you which have the Holy Ghost tonight oh why you don't have to cry you can speak because it's in you it's in you to do it he said I'll be with you even in you and when it's in you there's a lot of power in that because he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you want to be an overcomer tonight recognize who's inside of you and you can start to realize that it's greater than he that's in the world he that is in me you see brother Brandon would tell us that science said the Bumblebee shouldn't be able to fly but he said it's a good thing the Bumblebee didn't know what science was saying about him because he flew anyhow that bumblebee wasn't listening to the voice of the devil that bumblebee wasn't listening to the father of lies and so he got up and took wings and flew anyhow and that's the problem you begin to focus out the LIE of the devil telling you that you can't fly telling you that you can't make it telling you that the Rapture is not for you telling you that the Holy Ghost isn't for you oh brother but the believer has the ability to focus only on the word of God and you can fly anyhow you can fly out of your condition tonight you can fly out of the deepest darkest trials tonight because it's in you to do it it was in the Bumblebee to fly no matter what science said oh and it's a good thing sometimes we don't know what science says about us it was a good thing that sister Elena didn't know what science said about her or if she knew then she didn't care because she went ahead and she became cancer-free anyhow it's a good thing that Congressman Upshaw wasn't paying attention to what science said about him because he walked anyhow it's a good thing that you got a pastor and you got a group of Believers in front of me that aren't worried about what science says because you're here anyhow maybe you shouldn't be here but you are anyhow because you're looking to the Unseen you're looking to the promise you're looking to the word of testimony and you're expressing your heart towards God that I believe you anyhow I don't care what science says I don't care what the devil says I'm an overcomer and I'm going to fly anyhow I'm going to rise out of my condition oh I don't know who told you you could not make it I don't know who told you you could not take it but it wasn't Jesus it must have been the devil and so don't focus on that focus on the word of God and let the promise of God be your ceiling oh and you keep rising and you can fly brother you can fly out of every situation you can fly out of every dark every dark hole you see sometimes there's things in you that you don't realize sometimes you have abilities that you don't even know and sometimes if you take a record and you put a needle on that record brother it'll bring forth beautiful music but you can't see that music you can only hear it and so if you're just looking at that record then then you're you're not going to even know what lays inside of it that's a pretty record but but what kind of music does it play and there's sometimes where you're in life and sometimes you think that it's not in you and so you get so discouraged like you're trying to learn an instrument and sometimes it gets discouraging trying to learn an instrument and you think is is this all it's ever going to sound like is this all I'm ever going to be able to play is this is it always going to sound like a dead duck is this all it's ever going to amount to and then your neighbor picks up the instrument and it sounds so good like my why can't I do that why can't I sound like that why can't why can't I play like that and so you give up and you and you quit because you think this is all it's ever going to be but there's something about an instrument that you must realize that God is not calling you you see you have attributes in you just like God had attributes to be healer and savior and deliverer God's made you with attributes to sing and to preach and to and to love the scenery and to love to bake and to love to cook but sometimes the devil gets you so down and so discouraged that you can't express the real you because you're so tormented by depression and anxiety and the devil's trying to play his music through your life but what was already recorded on the record that's the identification that's the true you and and God has the the right needle to play out that music from your life but what you can realize is you are not ever supposed to be the musician you were only ever supposed to be the instrument and so you get frustrated trying to play the music out of your life but you're not the musician yield yourself as an instrument of righteousness into the hands of God and let him bring forth that music out of your life let him bring forth the the precious music of the real you oh and then you get up in church and start singing you start getting up in church and Clapping Your Hands and it was the real you all along but you just had to yield yourself you say oh sometimes I'm scared to yield myself because I don't know what I'm going to do uh you you don't have to know you might go to shouting your neighbor might go to dancing your other neighbor may go to preaching your other neighbor may go to being a wonderful housewife but don't worry so much about what you're going to do when you start yielding just worry about yielding and let the master musician get a hold of your violin and begin to play a masterpiece out of your life begin to play the true identity of who you are oh you say brother Isaac but there's so many things holding me back there's so many barriers if you only knew what my daddy was like if you only knew what my mama was like Daddy abused this one mama had this problem Daddy smok Daddy drank and there's all these barriers holding you back they're unseen barriers you can't see them but they're very real they're very real that depression it's very real but you can't see it but it's a barrier in your life but but there's something about those barriers you know that they could train elephants and and when they're very young they could put a a heavy chain on their leg and they could try to pull against that chain and pull against against it and they could never break away and when they get older brother they could pull against a little piece of twine and feel a little bit of resistance and give up even so much till three elephants died in a circus fire because they thought that they were held down when they could have so easily broke that chain you know there's something brother Gabriel you can go and there's actually there's something that they they tell us about about training fleas that you can take those fleas and you can put them in a jar and they'll jump out of that jar so easily but you put a lid on that jar and they leave that lid on there for three days and brother at the end of those three days you can take that lid off and those fleas will never jump higher than that lid was and you know what it's got such a bondage over them that even their off spring won't ever jump any higher than that height of that lid ever was you know you can train you can try to help a chicken Peck out of that egg but that's not the natural way the best way for a chicken to be born is to Peck out himself and you can try to do it but brother you'll mess up their development you'll mess up the development of their children and they'll become an offspring of of challenged chickens uh uh poor developed chickens but brother you could be held under that bondage under that barrier thinking that this is all it's ever going to be tugging against that chain tugging against that weight over your life of past mistakes and failures but we had a man one time and they put him in a place and they put him in there and they tried to seal him in there for three days brother Gabriel and there was no man-made intervention but they put that stone over that cave over that tomb and they had it locked in there there was no way he could get out but because of divine intervention there was an unseen one that come on the scene and he broke out of that tomb oh no no tomb could hold him no barrier could hold him no lid could hold him and after 3 days he didn't just lay there as a dead man anymore but he broke out of that tomb and he said because I live you shall live also and I'm breeding forth an offspring of Overcomers who will not be limited by barriers of this world but they'll be only limited oh to to to my word oh I'm bringing forth an offspring of Overcomers I'll breed back a people who will stay with every word I'll breed back a people who will break through every barrier I'll breed back a people who will look to the on scene I'll breed back a people who will not be limited I'll breed back of people who will break through that sound barrier and come into the place where all things are possible nothing is too hard for my God as the musicians come you you you sometimes feel like he's left you you know there's a forgotten beatitude brother Bram tells us about and it's John was in a prison and he got offended at the Lord why are things not going the way I thought they would be but there was a a beatitude blessed is he who is not offending to me and sometimes you think the Lord's left you sometimes you think the Lord's forgotten you and sometimes you even forget his beatitude but he hasn't forgotten you and sometimes you think he's so far but sometimes he's just asleep in the boat sometimes he was there all the time and sometimes it may not be that he he forsook you but sometimes maybe we forsake Him we leave him in the boat sleeping and those disciples would say did it ever Dawn on you that he's been in the boat the whole time did it ever Dawn on you that he's here did it ever Dawn on you that he he's there and he just wants to be woken up he's just waiting on somebody to wake him up and and how do I wake him up brother Isaac by believing his word by by taking him at his word faith brings him on the scene he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll never I'll never you see sometimes you're focused on the trial so much that it looks like God's mad at you or God's angry at you but like that picture of the cloud that that look like Angry clouds if you just get a little closer it looks like angel wings beating together you you you have the ability tonight to look again you say brother Isaac it looks like a great trial you know it may be blessed blessings and disguising you know what looks like more more trials and more testings could be because God has more confidence in you than maybe you realized if we could get our Focus right and let it become just as Cal and get if you could get that channel cleared out that channel of complexes and and weights and and symptoms that you've looked at and and get it cleared out and and just let that let it become so common I believe that the Lord can restore the commonness of his presence I believe the Lord can can Co so come on the scene in the darkest of hours and sometimes it feels like your darkest hour but his presence always brings new hopes and as long as you can recognize that his presence is here tonight there's still hope there's still hope for your situation there's still hope for your sick there's still hope for your loved ones there's still hope when that when that on scene comes on the scene so if you believe it if we could just see what the prophet said about Abraham Abraham believed it and God saw his faith but he didn't just stop there he made ready for it you say I believe it tonight brother Isaac well you have a right to make ready for it here brother brandom could say it is a lesson to us to look to what Abraham did not only did he believe it but he made ready for it he made preparations this child that he saw by faith 25 years before the child ever come he had considered that he who told him was able to keep the promise that he had told him he didn't consider any of his nature being hundred years old his physical being he didn't did not he consider at all the deadness of the womb of his wife Sarah and the writer of the Divine commentary tells us that he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God and brother brand tells us in works as Faith expressed says I it says his words I know it's the truth it's God's word it's the truth he said something begins to pulsate in your bosom that it is the truth then make ready you're coming out of there just as certain as I stand in this Pulpit tonight oh if you feel that P pulsation in your heart you can make ready for it you can make ready for it as we stand our feet maybe that faith is already in your heart but if you'd like to express to him that you believe him why don't you just start thanking him for it as we close our eyes every head bowed and and I I know that as a man that our words can be maybe chopped up and if I said anything that wasn't right just forgive me and lay it aside but we're in the presence of the Unseen one and when the Unseen comes on the sing things chains you know see I've got a wife tonight because the onene came on the scene there's a a lot of lies that would have had her gone but because the on scene came on the scene I've got a wife I've got a little baby because the on scene came on the scene at a youth camp one time I get to hold him in my hands and love him because the on scene came on the scene our sister Ella here with us receive the holy ghost in a meeting one time oh and think about your situations all the Lord's done for you when the on scene came on the scene and whatever your need is tonight he's the same God and we can declare by the word that he's here and if the Unseen would just come on the scene and we believe he's here all then he can do for you what he's done for me oh how your pastor is still here tonight because the on scene came on the scene and and lifted him up out of the condition he was in and so why don't you just go to expressing to the Lord why don't you just go to thinking him whatever need you have on your heart tonight why don't you just go and if you have to take the adopted child then just start there say Lord I Thank you for it I I maybe don't have the Revelation but Lord I want it and Lord I thank you for the promise Lord I believe it's going to come and oh god he's a god of mercy and right in that crucial moment he can step in oh and he could drop that in your heart and his grace and mercy oh and it'll be all different then oh just express it to him Heavenly Father Lord I know my words tonight have been chopped up and Lord I know father that Lord we have no ability of our own but father there's just something in our hearts as Believers Lord you've given us a Grace to be able to be a candidate for association with a world where all things are possible and father we have a different understanding tonight Lord than what we see with our eyes we have an understanding that nothing is too hard for you Lord we have an understanding that Lord depression has no hold over a child of God Lord that anxiety has no hold over a daughter of God Lord that fear is a liar Lord You've not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and father I believe that your healing is here I believe your perfect love is casting out fear I believe you're here tonight and Lord you can meet the the hardest of needs you can you can go to the darkest of situations Lord and someone tonight may feel like they're in their Darkest Hour they've ever seen But Lord we recognize your presence and it brings hope to us tonight Lord that just a moment Lord just Lord if Moses could spend five minutes in your presence and never be the same Lord because he was attracted to something father I believe there's a presence here tonight that just in a few seconds Lord could break every stronghold Lord could turn every situation around father you're the Healer you're the deliver and father right now we choose to consider your word over the situation we choose to consider that you're a Healer we choose to consider that's you're deliverer father and we pray for this assembly Lord Lord that whatever they have need of Father may you just Lord meet them in this crucial moment Lord Lord we could never call Lord we can never Lord receive Revelation out of our own ability it's by Grace you give it and Lord faith is a revelation but father in your grace and mercy if you drop that Lord just a little Revelation in someone's heart tonight Lord that would settle it Lord that they wouldn't be tossed to and fro anymore but they could be able to say I know it's finished I know I'm a daughter of God I know I'm a Son of God and Lord what we're doing tonight though we may not realize it father there's something going on there's an invisible iion that you're that you're performing between you and your bride Lord there's something taking place you put a seed on the inside of our hearts and Lord we're watering that seed and we're as we water that word it's carrying us to our unseen bridegroom it's carrying us back home father we don't have to fear Lord if it's going to be enough Lord you started the work and you'll finish it Lord you'll never leave us nor forsake us father I believe you which began the work you which filled us with the Hool Holy Ghost you're able to change our bodies Lord I don't believe we have to fear whether or not we're going to make it you said through your Prophet you've already made it Lord those of us Lord who have Christ in the ship those of us who have that Holy Ghost father may you break off every fear and every complex and Lord if there be one without you in the ship tonight Lord I believe if you're still calling there's still a holy ghost to receive father have your way Lord in in the hearts of your children and Lord we just want to say thank you for it Lord we just want to express our Thanksgiving to you father Lord that you kept them this long Lord we want to thank you Lord that you've healed that you touched and healed our brother Ron that he could be here tonight we want to thank you Lord Lord we want to express to you our faith father that that that that you've been so good to this assembly Lord you've
