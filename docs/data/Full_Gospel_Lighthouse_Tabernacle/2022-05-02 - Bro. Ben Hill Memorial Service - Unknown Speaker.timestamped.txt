[15:26] amen i'm glad that he guides us along
[15:29] life's way
[15:30] amen you can be seated
[15:33] i'd like to read from job chapter 14
[15:36] beginning with verse 1 this
[15:39] evening
[15:40] it says
[15:42] man is born of woman in a few days and
[15:45] full of trouble
[15:46] he cometh forth like a flower and is cut
[15:49] down
[15:50] he fleeth also as a shadow
[15:53] and continueth not
[15:55] he dost thou
[15:56] open that eyes upon such
[15:59] and one
[16:00] and bringeth me into judgment with thee
[16:03] who can bring a clean thing out of an
[16:06] unclean thing
[16:07] not one
[16:08] seeing his days are determined
[16:11] the number of his months
[16:13] are with thee
[16:14] thou has appointed
[16:16] his bounds
[16:18] that cannot pass
[16:20] turn from him that he may rest
[16:23] until he shall accomplish
[16:25] as in hirling his day
[16:27] for there is hope of a tree
[16:30] if it be cut down it will sprout again
[16:34] and that the tender brunch
[16:37] thereof will not cease
[16:40] though the root thereof wax old in the
[16:43] earth
[16:44] and the stock thereof dying the ground
[16:46] yet through the scent of water
[16:49] it will bud and bring forth
[16:52] bounds like a
[16:54] bounce like a plant
[16:56] but a man dieth and wasteth away
[16:59] yay a man giveth the ghost
[17:01] and where is he
[17:03] as the waters
[17:05] fell from the sea and the flood decayeth
[17:07] and drieth up so a man lieth down
[17:10] and riseth not till the heavens be no
[17:14] more
[17:15] they shall not awake
[17:17] nor be risen out of their sleep
[17:20] oh that thou wouldest hide me in the
[17:22] grave that thou wouldest keep me secret
[17:25] until the wrath is be passed
[17:28] that thou would disappoint me a set time
[17:32] and remember me
[17:33] if a man die
[17:35] shall he live again
[17:37] all the days of my appointed time will i
[17:41] wait
[17:42] till my change come
[17:44] thou shall call and i will answer thee
[17:48] thou wilt have a desire for the work of
[17:51] thine hands
[17:52] for now thou numberst my steps
[17:55] dust thou not watch over my sin
[18:00] these scripture readings written by job
[18:03] as he would look forth as a vision and
[18:06] and say what would a man be like what is
[18:08] the life of a man
[18:10] and he turns to nature and he looks at
[18:13] nature how nature would
[18:14] would resurrect life once again
[18:18] and how that
[18:19] nature types the spiritual
[18:21] and he's explaining here as a tree would
[18:24] fall
[18:25] but it shall bring forth new life
[18:29] and so you'll notice
[18:32] of a morning of the sun comes up
[18:35] it's a baby it's raised or weak and as
[18:38] it comes through the teenage years
[18:40] about nine or ten o'clock and then about
[18:42] noon time the middle of the day it's in
[18:45] its full strength
[18:47] then it begins to fall and fail
[18:49] finally sunsets
[18:51] over the west
[18:53] and the dye and it dies out for the day
[18:57] could we call that the end of the sun
[19:00] no
[19:02] no the next morning it comes back again
[19:05] and brings a new day for us all
[19:09] now what is it it's god's expression
[19:12] the word expressed means
[19:15] to make known
[19:17] a feeling
[19:18] it's god's expression to us
[19:21] to let us know his feeling for us
[19:23] that death
[19:24] does not separate us eternally
[19:27] for we'll rise again and come back again
[19:31] amen as we see that the sun is going
[19:34] each and every morning each and every
[19:36] day a new day resurrection of life it's
[19:38] an expression
[19:40] of life an expression of what we behold
[19:44] you hear this this evening friends and
[19:47] family
[19:48] you're given an expression
[19:50] expression of brother ben as a son
[19:53] expression
[19:54] as a brother
[19:55] expression as a true friend
[19:58] you're expressing your love for him by
[20:00] showing up this evening
[20:02] and that's what god wants to do through
[20:04] us is express himself through us in each
[20:07] and every day
[20:09] yet
[20:10] we have beautiful flowers here and
[20:13] and before long they're gonna start to
[20:15] die
[20:16] and they'll fade away
[20:18] and we'll see that
[20:20] rain comes and washes the seeds down
[20:22] into the ground
[20:23] just a little bit maybe
[20:26] the fall comes freeze comes and
[20:29] and then here comes spring
[20:31] sun that would shine down
[20:33] and that seed of life that has went down
[20:36] into the ground
[20:37] is now beginning to bud forth once again
[20:40] an expression of life resurrection
[20:42] a life newness has come forth again
[20:48] and brother branham would say it like
[20:49] this and says the sun seems
[20:52] to many times be far away
[20:55] but when it begins to shine the sun of
[20:57] righteousness will shine with his
[20:59] healing wings
[21:01] and every life no matter where
[21:04] it is buried how deep how far the waters
[21:07] it is in the sands or the rocks
[21:10] it'll rise to glory with god
[21:13] because god is expressing to us showing
[21:16] us just what he's doing his purpose to
[21:19] show us
[21:20] through the flowers through the sun
[21:22] through the trees through all of life
[21:25] in his resurrection
[21:27] the life
[21:28] of god resurrecting his life
[21:31] when it serves its purpose in your life
[21:34] god's serving his purpose
[21:37] through you
[21:38] now these beautiful flowers here they
[21:40] they come in different varieties
[21:43] there's white flowers pink flowers
[21:46] certain flowers but each one of them is
[21:48] beautiful
[21:50] and we put them all together will make a
[21:52] beautiful bouquet
[21:54] now god loves each and every one of us
[21:55] and we're not all the same
[21:59] he loves a beautiful variety of life
[22:05] we
[22:07] he has big mountains and little hills
[22:10] plains and he has deserts and seas
[22:12] he has the oak tree the palm tree and
[22:15] everything blended together
[22:17] in its place where god
[22:19] god and all of nature can live and enjoy
[22:22] his being
[22:24] he's living in his creatures and times
[22:26] and serving his purposes
[22:29] if he thinks enough of a resurrection
[22:32] like that
[22:33] he made a way of escape
[22:35] for that for the service for the future
[22:37] for you
[22:38] and how much more has he for the people
[22:41] regardless of who they are
[22:43] what race color creed or what more
[22:46] dwell in united
[22:48] in god's purpose
[22:49] and his blessing
[22:51] there will be a resurrection someday
[22:54] just as sure as the resurrection of that
[22:56] flower that i was speaking about
[22:59] we all see that
[23:01] we all believe that this evening
[23:04] and they are testifying and telling us
[23:07] making it known
[23:08] that a feeling of god that he wants to
[23:11] show to you
[23:13] amen i love his resurrection power
[23:16] of what he can do in an instant time
[23:18] and a man's life
[23:20] i enjoyed and had the privilege of
[23:23] speaking last
[23:25] ben's last sermon that he would hear on
[23:27] easter weekend as he would sit there and
[23:29] come in the back there
[23:31] sit beside his dad and just enjoy
[23:34] service and worship
[23:38] you know it's it's a it's a beautiful
[23:41] beautiful thing how life
[23:43] will worship
[23:45] now this isn't the end
[23:47] this is only beginning
[23:50] now we just want to make that step
[23:52] towards christ
[23:53] and we want to be resurrected in his
[23:55] life
[23:56] his fullness of what he would want
[23:58] through us
[24:00] amen maybe we'll sing that song blessed
[24:03] be the name of the lord blessed be the

[30:35] [Music]
[30:47] you
[30:54] [Music]
[31:03] amen
[31:04] god bless you this afternoon
[31:07] first i'd like to
[31:09] express my sincere sincerest condolences
[31:11] and sympathy to the family
[31:13] the hill family and all the friends that
[31:15] came here to honor brother ben hill this
[31:17] afternoon
[31:19] i'd like to read
[31:20] out of john 3 16
[31:23] very familiar text
[31:24] for god so loved the world
[31:27] that he gave his only begotten son that
[31:28] whosoever believeth in him
[31:31] should not perish but have everlasting
[31:33] life
[31:34] for god sent not his son into the world
[31:36] to condemn the world
[31:38] but that the world through him might be
[31:40] saved
[31:41] he that believeth on him
[31:43] is not condemned
[31:45] but he that believeth not is condemned
[31:47] already
[31:48] because
[31:50] he hath not believed in the name of the
[31:52] only begotten son of god
[31:55] that's a text that most any sunday
[31:56] school that's one of the first
[31:57] scriptures that little children learn in
[32:00] sunday school and for a good reason
[32:02] because it's a very very powerful
[32:03] scripture
[32:05] because god did send
[32:07] god so loved the world that he sent his
[32:09] only begotten son
[32:11] in life we're free moral agents in life
[32:14] and life life's choices that we make
[32:16] bring us in very many different
[32:17] directions
[32:19] but god knows the weakness of humanity
[32:22] and god's mercies are new
[32:24] each and every day
[32:26] god is always ready and willing to
[32:28] forgive
[32:29] and he loves in ways that we cannot
[32:31] imagine
[32:33] he reaches down in places we cannot
[32:35] reach
[32:36] and his grace finds this out
[32:39] because we were all born in sin
[32:41] shaped in iniquity and we've come to
[32:42] this world speaking lies
[32:44] but the love of god found us
[32:48] he seeks for you
[32:49] and he's looking for you
[32:51] in john 14 jesus speaking his very own
[32:54] words
[32:55] he says i will not leave you comfortless
[32:57] i will come to you
[32:59] that's a promise
[33:01] it's a simple
[33:02] promise
[33:04] but god promised he won't leave you
[33:05] comfortless
[33:06] he'll come to you and he'll comfort you
[33:08] he'll comfort you in a way
[33:10] when all the friends are gone when
[33:12] everyone's had to go back to life he'll
[33:14] be there and he'll comfort you
[33:17] it's also important during this time
[33:20] to put any questions
[33:22] and worry aside
[33:25] we have to trust
[33:27] the power of the blood of jesus christ
[33:30] because like i said it reaches in places
[33:31] that we can only can't even begin to
[33:33] imagine
[33:34] in isaiah 55 the bible says seek ye the
[33:37] lord
[33:38] why he may be found
[33:40] call ye upon him while he is near
[33:43] let the wicked forsake his way in the
[33:45] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[33:47] return unto the lord and he will have
[33:49] mercy on him
[33:51] and to our god for he will abundantly
[33:54] pardon
[33:55] for my thoughts
[33:57] are not your thoughts
[33:59] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[34:02] lord
[34:03] for as the heavens are higher than the
[34:05] earth so are my ways higher than your
[34:08] ways
[34:09] in my thoughts than your thoughts
[34:12] when there's a death in the family
[34:14] there's always a temptation to ask why
[34:16] why this why that
[34:18] we must trust the lord
[34:20] because his ways are so much higher than
[34:22] our ways
[34:24] i didn't have the opportunity to
[34:25] personally know ben
[34:27] but i do know his family
[34:29] and i know that ben had many lighthouses
[34:31] in his life there was no shortage of
[34:33] lighthouses and friends and family
[34:35] that shine the true light and life and
[34:37] gospel of our lord jesus christ
[34:40] and i believe that these very
[34:41] lighthouses and the influence of these
[34:43] lighthouses
[34:45] brought ben to the house of god on his
[34:47] very last day
[34:50] i was up here and he brother matthew was
[34:52] preaching as he said
[34:54] brother ben sat in the back
[34:56] and he responded to the service
[34:59] when the worship was going on he raised
[35:01] his hand
[35:03] now we know
[35:04] we know that in order to make a reaction
[35:07] to reach out to the lord there must be
[35:09] something inside
[35:11] there must be something because gravity
[35:13] makes our hands hang down and there must
[35:16] be something in our heart speaking to us
[35:19] and i believe something spoke to him
[35:21] that made him reach out
[35:25] on what on whatever level god knows
[35:28] but i believe god spoke to him
[35:31] and i believe god i believe brother ben
[35:32] responded
[35:34] and i believe that these very light
[35:35] houses invents life
[35:38] and the investment the bible says to
[35:39] raise up a child in the way that he
[35:41] should go
[35:43] and many times in life it's a puzzle to
[35:45] us
[35:46] but i believe the way you raised brother
[35:48] ben
[35:51] made him come to the house of god
[35:55] maybe throughout life
[35:57] maybe choices that were made
[36:01] didn't look
[36:03] like things were paying off
[36:06] but in the end
[36:09] that's what matters
[36:12] because god is a merciful god
[36:14] and there's an influence
[36:16] of these christian lights
[36:18] and salvation is simple
[36:21] salvation is simple and god's how god
[36:23] has in simplicity because remember god
[36:25] doesn't condemn a man for being a sinner
[36:27] we've all come to the world being
[36:29] sinners but what what a sinner's
[36:30] condemned for is for refusing the way
[36:35] and there's a reason we have a picture
[36:36] of jesus
[36:38] right up there because he is the way
[36:41] he is the only way
[36:43] jesus said i am the resurrection and the
[36:46] life
[36:47] he that believeth in me though he were
[36:49] dead yet shall he live
[36:52] and another place further down jesus
[36:54] said i am the way
[36:56] the truth and the life
[36:58] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[37:02] in john 9 5 as long as i am in the world
[37:05] i am the light of the world he's the
[37:08] life he's the light he's the he's the
[37:11] truth the way
[37:12] he's the resurrection
[37:15] in saint john chapter six jesus speaking
[37:17] said verily verily i say unto you
[37:20] he that believeth on me hath everlasting
[37:22] life
[37:24] i am that bread of life
[37:26] your fathers did eat men are in the
[37:28] wilderness and are dead
[37:30] this is the bread which came down from
[37:32] heaven
[37:33] that a man may eat thereof and not die
[37:36] i am
[37:38] the living bread
[37:39] which came down from heaven
[37:41] if any man eat of this bread he shall
[37:44] live forever and the bread that i will
[37:46] give is my flesh
[37:48] which i give for the life of the world
[37:52] the bible speaks of two deaths
[37:55] one is natural
[37:58] and the other is spiritual
[38:00] jesus came to save us from that second
[38:03] death which is eternal separation from
[38:06] god
[38:07] if time goes on
[38:09] we'll all go by way of the grave
[38:12] but by the grace of god and through the
[38:14] shed blood of jesus christ we can never
[38:16] be separated from god
[38:20] god is merciful
[38:22] and as i said god is our comforter and
[38:24] he's our god
[38:26] he promised to carry us through the hard
[38:28] times
[38:29] and he will
[38:31] it reminds me of that dream that man had
[38:34] where he was had a very troubling he had
[38:36] a dream that
[38:38] he was looking back on the sins of time
[38:39] on his life
[38:41] and through the hardest times
[38:44] he he dreamed that he was walking with
[38:46] the lord on the beach and there were two
[38:47] sets of footprints but during the
[38:49] toughest hardest times
[38:51] there was only one set
[38:54] and he asked the lord he said lord why
[38:56] is it during my most hardest times
[39:00] that you would leave me
[39:02] and only leave me one and there's only
[39:04] one set why would you leave me
[39:06] in the hardest times of my life
[39:10] and jesus responded to the man in the
[39:11] dream and he said it was then that i
[39:14] carried you
[39:16] so may he carry you and he will amen
[39:47] oh

[43:11] thank you brother shannon
[43:14] amen
[43:15] to say thank you to each and every one
[43:17] of you
[43:18] that have come today to support the hill
[43:20] family
[43:21] in this time of crisis
[43:24] and i would like to offer to brother
[43:25] doug and sister donna my deepest
[43:27] sincerity and condolences unto you
[43:30] we do not plan for these things
[43:32] we definitely do not plan to bury our
[43:34] children
[43:35] before our time but god we rest in these
[43:38] promises that god is faithful
[43:41] and he is the author and the finisher
[43:44] of our faith
[43:45] the bible says in isaiah 53
[43:49] who hath believed our report
[43:52] and to whom is the arm of the lord
[43:54] revealed
[43:55] for he shall grow up before him as a
[43:57] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[44:00] ground
[44:01] he hath no form nor commonness
[44:04] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[44:07] that we should desire him
[44:10] he is despised and rejected of men
[44:14] he is a man of sorrows and acquaintance
[44:16] with grief
[44:18] when isaiah was writing these things and
[44:20] he caught the vision of who this was
[44:24] he was speaking of our lord
[44:26] but look at the the titles that he has
[44:28] given he is despised
[44:31] he is rejected of men
[44:33] a man of sorrows
[44:35] acquaint it with grief
[44:37] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[44:40] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[44:43] surely he hath borne our griefs
[44:46] and carried our sorrows
[44:48] yet we did esteem him stricken smitten
[44:51] of god and afflicted
[44:53] but he was wounded for our
[44:54] transgressions
[44:56] he was bruised for our iniquities
[44:58] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[45:01] him
[45:01] and with his stripes we are healed
[45:05] today we recognize and understand that
[45:08] we are serving a god who understands
[45:11] that the bible tells us that he was in
[45:13] all points he was tempted like
[45:16] as we are yet without sin
[45:19] i cannot relate to you on the level like
[45:21] jesus can relate to you i can understand
[45:24] the loss of a loved one or understand
[45:26] the loss of a family member but jesus
[45:28] understands your deepest and your
[45:30] darkest fears
[45:32] the bible will tell us that he he knew
[45:35] sorrow
[45:36] and grief so intimately that he would be
[45:39] called a man of sorrows
[45:41] this is among other reasons made him
[45:44] despised and rejected by men
[45:47] he made our griefs
[45:49] his own
[45:50] and our sorrows if they were his
[45:53] the image is that he loaded them and
[45:56] carried them on his back
[45:58] so that we wouldn't have to
[46:00] the bible tells us and gives us a title
[46:02] of this man
[46:04] that he was known by grief
[46:06] he was known by his troubles
[46:08] jesus was notorious for them
[46:11] these were his constant companions when
[46:14] disciples would leave him
[46:16] his familiar acquaintance
[46:18] was with grief
[46:20] so he understands today
[46:22] his life was one continued series
[46:26] of sorrows
[46:27] from the cradle to the cross
[46:29] in his infancy
[46:31] his life was sought for by herod
[46:33] and he was obliged to be taken by his
[46:35] parents and flee into egypt
[46:37] he ate his bread and sorrow
[46:40] and with his sweat of his brown he met
[46:42] with much sorrow from the hardness and
[46:44] unbelief of men's hearts
[46:46] and from the contradiction of sinners
[46:49] against himself
[46:50] even much from the forwardness of his
[46:53] own disciples
[46:54] much from the temptations of satan
[46:57] and as the surety of his people he was
[46:59] exceeding sorrowful in the garden
[47:01] when his sweat was as it were the great
[47:03] drops of blood and went on the cross
[47:05] with the sins of his people
[47:07] and the enduring pains and the agonies
[47:10] of a shameful and a cursed death he was
[47:12] made up of sorrows
[47:14] and made up of grief
[47:16] and how many people today carry around
[47:18] pain
[47:19] they carry around grief and they carry
[47:21] around sorrow
[47:24] when jesus is the one that carried them
[47:26] for you
[47:27] he took them for us
[47:31] but for it to do us any good we have to
[47:33] release our grief
[47:35] and we have to release our sorrow so if
[47:38] there is anyone here that can console
[47:40] you or comfort you today as a family
[47:42] it is none other than a man jesus christ
[47:46] a man who is acquainted with grief
[47:50] david would say that the lord is nigh
[47:52] unto them that are of a broken heart
[47:55] and saveth such as of a contrite spirit
[47:58] psalms 147 and says
[48:00] force 3 it said he healeth
[48:03] the broken in heart
[48:05] and he bindeth up their wounds
[48:08] he is
[48:10] and will forever be the healer of those
[48:13] that are broken
[48:15] to those that have been crushed by the
[48:16] calamities of life he is the healer he
[48:20] is the healer of those whose lives seem
[48:22] to be wrecked or crippled by
[48:23] circumstances whose hopes have been
[48:26] shattered and by pain and by despair by
[48:29] abuse and by struggles and when your
[48:31] heart feels like it can't go on and your
[48:33] heart is broken
[48:35] it feels like it's the end of the world
[48:37] like a knife has struck you right in
[48:39] your heart and the pain is so deep and
[48:41] it feels like there's a giant a giant
[48:43] hole
[48:45] he is the
[48:46] healer when you cry yourself to sleep
[48:50] he is the healer
[48:51] when you are broken he is the healer
[48:54] and he understands the heart of a mother
[48:58] he understands the heart of a father
[49:01] science even tells us that when you have
[49:03] a broken heart
[49:05] that your brain literally is telling
[49:07] your body that you are in pain
[49:10] when you are a friend and you're in pain
[49:13] god understands
[49:15] and the actually the area of the brain
[49:17] that lights up when you are hurt
[49:19] physically is the same area that lights
[49:22] up
[49:22] when you're suffering from a heartbreak
[49:26] when a surge of stress hormones strike
[49:28] it and calls the reaction called
[49:30] what science calls the heartbreak
[49:32] syndrome
[49:34] that can be caused by an emotional
[49:36] stressful event
[49:37] maybe the death of a loved one
[49:39] the loss of a child
[49:41] and every one of us we deal people deal
[49:44] with grief and they deal with pain
[49:46] differently
[49:47] some publicly
[49:49] and some privately
[49:51] but at the end of the day
[49:53] you have to deal with grief
[49:56] if not it will eat at you
[49:59] and it can destroy your spirit
[50:02] but as we have been told we must keep
[50:04] our spirit clean
[50:06] it's okay to understand and it's okay to
[50:08] maybe not understand and maybe ask the
[50:10] question why but jesus is the answer
[50:14] to your grief he's the answer to your
[50:16] pain
[50:18] and the wandering of our life
[50:20] jesus understands what we're going
[50:22] through
[50:24] jesus
[50:25] one time he walked he walked to a way
[50:28] and he was sitting down and he was
[50:29] having a meal with a family
[50:32] and there was there were some friends
[50:34] that came to him and said your friend
[50:35] lazarus is sick
[50:37] and he's going to the point of death
[50:39] but jesus stayed where he was at
[50:42] because he knew the will of the father
[50:44] and jesus stood there knowing all along
[50:48] what would take place
[50:50] and several days after the passing of
[50:52] lazarus jesus walked through a city
[50:56] and there martha met him
[50:58] and she spoke these words
[51:01] if you would have been here my brother
[51:03] would not have died
[51:06] jesus we know
[51:07] was all god
[51:09] he was definitely a man
[51:12] but yet he was all god
[51:14] he was tempted just like you're tempted
[51:16] and he had tears just like you have
[51:18] tears
[51:19] the bible said that when he come to mary
[51:22] and martha that he walked up to them and
[51:24] said where have you laid him at
[51:27] and the bible said
[51:29] that jesus
[51:30] wept
[51:32] to think that jesus was so close to
[51:34] humanity that almighty god wanted to
[51:37] come and and to take on humanity so that
[51:40] he could feel like brother doug and
[51:42] could feel like sister don and sister
[51:44] tracy and sister heather
[51:46] and sister jenny to understand what
[51:48] you're going through he had to robe
[51:49] himself in humanity and as jesus makes
[51:52] his way
[51:54] to the tomb of lazarus where here was
[51:56] one of his best friends in life and
[51:59] jesus begins to weep
[52:01] maybe we would see and maybe we would
[52:03] understand
[52:04] just for a moment that jesus maybe he
[52:06] was weeping because he was going to have
[52:09] to bring him back to the life of trouble
[52:11] to the life of turmoil to the life of
[52:13] crisis
[52:14] and jesus was weeping but he was moved
[52:18] by a man and some would say that that
[52:19] would prove that he was a man and he
[52:21] wasn't more he wasn't god but just in a
[52:24] few moments he rolled back his shoulders
[52:27] and he spoke lazarus come forth showing
[52:30] exactly what he spoke to martha that i
[52:33] am the resurrection
[52:35] and i am the life
[52:37] he cares about your needs
[52:39] and he is the god of all comfort as paul
[52:41] would say
[52:43] even jesus at the death of his cousin at
[52:46] john the baptist hearing about how that
[52:48] he passed away when he heard it the
[52:50] bible tells us that he pulled back and
[52:51] he departed into a ship
[52:54] and jesus being a man wanted to get away
[52:56] from the crowd
[52:57] but there was such a powerful ministry
[52:59] that jesus had that the hungry followed
[53:01] him
[53:03] but the bible didn't say that he
[53:04] rejected those
[53:06] but the bible tells us that he opened up
[53:08] his bounds of compassion
[53:10] but when they left him
[53:12] then jesus had to have his moment
[53:14] because he didn't understood like you
[53:16] and he had grief like you
[53:18] but what did jesus do
[53:20] he climbed up on the mountain to pray
[53:24] his friends and his disciples at that
[53:26] moment got caught in trouble
[53:28] out on the sea
[53:30] and then we find jesus walking on the
[53:32] water
[53:33] you see as i've just depicted to you
[53:36] that in all of christ's grieving
[53:38] some of the greatest miracles took place
[53:41] and in our grieving even here today and
[53:44] in the months to cone
[53:45] look for the hands of almighty god
[53:48] he will once again walk on water
[53:50] he will once again feed your hungry and
[53:52] aching soul
[53:54] and he will never push away
[53:57] the insignificant one
[54:00] it is a story as
[54:02] we prepare to sing this song sister
[54:04] whitney
[54:05] there's a story that is that is told
[54:07] about the the great leonardo da vinci
[54:10] that he started to work on time and his
[54:12] students
[54:13] had watched him as he brought them in
[54:16] and they he was planning out the subject
[54:18] and the perspective of sketching out the
[54:20] outline and applying the colors with his
[54:22] own
[54:23] genius ways
[54:25] then all of a sudden he he spoke and he
[54:27] paused
[54:28] the painting
[54:29] it was unfinished
[54:31] but he turned to his students
[54:34] and he said
[54:35] he said you finished the work
[54:40] and those students looked on that
[54:41] painting so we don't have the ability
[54:43] that you have we don't have the
[54:45] minecraft that you have to finish this
[54:47] work
[54:48] and da vinci said will not what i have
[54:50] already done inspire you to do your best
[54:55] and the one the student picked up and
[54:57] finished the painting and it's one of
[54:58] the greatest paintings it's known
[55:01] how much more is jesus looking at your
[55:03] life and saying can you not be inspired
[55:06] by what i have done
[55:08] take up the pen
[55:10] and do your best
[55:11] god bless you
[55:24] [Music]
[55:38] it's not just about the manger
[55:42] where the baby lays
[55:46] it's not all about the angels
[55:50] who sing for him that day
[55:54] it's not all about the shepherds
[56:00] [Music]
[56:13] it's

[1:00:10] we never think that we're going to come
[1:00:11] to a time like this
[1:00:15] in a young life
[1:00:18] brother doug is a pillar of this church
[1:00:20] sister donna
[1:00:23] they were here at the beginnings when
[1:00:24] all things were started here
[1:00:27] in the early 70s
[1:00:31] as a pastor here for quite a while now
[1:00:34] i've i've known ben since he was a boy
[1:00:38] watched him grow up
[1:00:41] enjoyed him in so many ways
[1:00:45] i
[1:00:47] i liked i liked it that he was rough
[1:00:51] i kind of like rough people
[1:00:54] i liked it that he was complicated
[1:00:59] you know because life is complicated
[1:01:03] life is difficult
[1:01:05] life takes a lot of roads
[1:01:09] today we are sitting here and many of
[1:01:11] you know
[1:01:12] being in a lot of different directions
[1:01:16] maybe you didn't know ben praying on his
[1:01:19] knees
[1:01:20] you knew him as a different man
[1:01:24] chad you were a great friend
[1:01:27] you knew him a lot of different
[1:01:28] directions
[1:01:33] brother doug was a great friend
[1:01:35] man
[1:01:38] the boys that you've just heard speak
[1:01:40] today or
[1:01:41] my boys
[1:01:43] i think one of the greatest things that
[1:01:45] there is is family
[1:01:48] and in this crazy
[1:01:50] generation that we live in
[1:01:53] never lose focus of your family
[1:01:57] and how quickly that it goes by
[1:02:02] brother doug created a place to where
[1:02:04] that his family could build homes
[1:02:06] could live close
[1:02:08] they could have coffee together cake
[1:02:10] together
[1:02:12] could enjoy meals together
[1:02:15] could pop in when we're all having
[1:02:16] haircuts
[1:02:19] it was in one of those places to when
[1:02:21] that
[1:02:22] ben came in and wanted to talk
[1:02:24] serious talk not about cars not about
[1:02:27] different things
[1:02:29] you want to talk about god
[1:02:32] it was in one of those spots that i was
[1:02:34] able to sit in a corner with him and
[1:02:37] spend some time with him
[1:02:39] talk to him about eternal things
[1:02:42] i think every one of us need to sit down
[1:02:43] at
[1:02:44] things and think about
[1:02:46] what is going to happen to me after i
[1:02:48] die
[1:02:54] a couple things that i don't know if
[1:02:55] you're aware of here
[1:02:58] but the first fellow that spoke today
[1:03:00] was
[1:03:01] the guy that would walk to the pulpit
[1:03:04] and preach ben's last sermon
[1:03:09] and then as he sat there and he listened
[1:03:12] and he responded
[1:03:14] sat with his father
[1:03:17] he had plans
[1:03:21] he had plans for the evening
[1:03:24] he responded to the word matthew didn't
[1:03:27] know that
[1:03:29] i'm preaching the last sermon
[1:03:31] to ben hill
[1:03:34] probably 250 people was here
[1:03:37] but it was ben's last service
[1:03:41] we didn't know that
[1:03:43] he didn't know that
[1:03:48] his resting place that evening
[1:03:51] chad after he had spent the day with you
[1:03:53] his resting place would be
[1:03:55] in brother wiggum's yard
[1:03:58] when his truck rolled over
[1:04:01] of the
[1:04:02] of the thousands of places
[1:04:05] to wreck
[1:04:08] you reckon a preacher's yard
[1:04:14] in a preacher's yard
[1:04:17] where the family could come
[1:04:21] hot chocolate would be served
[1:04:24] blankets and coats
[1:04:28] prayer could be taking place
[1:04:32] i think our heavenly father is so
[1:04:34] merciful to us
[1:04:37] we can't we can't imagine
[1:04:40] when we think we are in control of life
[1:04:45] we just can't imagine how much that he's
[1:04:48] watching over us
[1:04:52] i think about as i watched
[1:04:54] the pictures today and that was so well
[1:04:56] done i don't know who all was arranged
[1:04:58] in getting the pictures together today
[1:05:00] but i think that was one of the best
[1:05:01] that i've ever witnessed
[1:05:05] brother doug you sitting on a
[1:05:07] on a little boat and he's on the other
[1:05:10] end of it
[1:05:14] you guys are enjoying the day
[1:05:17] a full wheeler that they'll enjoy
[1:05:20] those are moments
[1:05:22] moments that you got to enjoy
[1:05:25] you got to love
[1:05:29] military school
[1:05:32] marriage
[1:05:37] work
[1:05:41] chad i don't know if you know this but
[1:05:42] he really loved working with you man
[1:05:45] he loved it
[1:05:46] he told me how much he loved it
[1:06:01] but every day you got to go home
[1:06:05] home
[1:06:10] in the evenings no matter how long you
[1:06:12] work
[1:06:14] no matter how difficult the day
[1:06:17] you go home
[1:06:20] i think home is a wonderful place
[1:06:24] i just heard andrew speak about it
[1:06:26] jesus had a friend
[1:06:29] it was a kind of a place to where that
[1:06:33] that jesus felt comfortable going
[1:06:38] two sisters and a brother
[1:06:41] the brother was young
[1:06:45] but that brother got sick
[1:06:49] and brother he got sick and he continued
[1:06:51] to get sick
[1:06:53] and he died
[1:06:56] and they called for jesus to come
[1:06:59] now just think about the
[1:07:01] the place that they had preserved for
[1:07:03] him as their house
[1:07:06] i quite honestly wouldn't want any of
[1:07:08] the presidents to come to my house
[1:07:11] nor the queen of england
[1:07:15] but the king of the kings and the lord
[1:07:17] of lords
[1:07:18] has been invited to my house
[1:07:23] and he's welcomed there
[1:07:26] 24 hours a day
[1:07:28] he already knows what i do
[1:07:30] he already knows how i think
[1:07:33] he knows before that i even speak the
[1:07:36] words that are going to come out of my
[1:07:37] mouth
[1:07:40] and so jesus being a man
[1:07:43] needs a place to rest at times and it's
[1:07:46] been that kind of a home
[1:07:50] but i want to thank god at this moment
[1:07:52] that he cares enough
[1:07:54] he never forgets you
[1:07:58] and on his way back in
[1:08:00] his sister asked him said if you would
[1:08:02] have been here
[1:08:05] my brother wouldn't have died
[1:08:08] maybe if we would have done something
[1:08:10] different
[1:08:11] we wouldn't be sitting here today
[1:08:14] but god holds our life in his hands
[1:08:19] and he's the kind of god
[1:08:22] he's the kind of god that
[1:08:24] that created the heavens and the earth
[1:08:27] and holds all the stars in their places
[1:08:31] and yet he can be so great he can do all
[1:08:34] of that and yet he can create the
[1:08:36] smallest molecule
[1:08:39] in your body
[1:08:43] and you say well brother ron but i'm
[1:08:44] young
[1:08:46] and i've got my life to live
[1:08:49] the average funeral is 18 years old
[1:08:53] so let me just say this to you don't
[1:08:55] count on waiting till you're 90
[1:08:59] to give your life to god
[1:09:02] don't face god as your judge
[1:09:06] don't face him
[1:09:09] and
[1:09:10] and unlike and have be at a spot to
[1:09:12] where that god has to say
[1:09:14] i never i never knew you
[1:09:17] i i don't want to be there to a spot to
[1:09:19] where god is my judge i want him as my
[1:09:22] savior
[1:09:26] i want him as my savior
[1:09:31] i understand i
[1:09:32] understand being saved
[1:09:36] i understand how difficult life can be
[1:09:41] i'll give you a couple for instance a
[1:09:43] few years ago i was in a
[1:09:45] in a scrap yard in
[1:09:47] near west virginia
[1:09:50] and i was just i was just there
[1:09:53] was working with the boys here and
[1:09:57] there was a roughit guy he was just
[1:09:59] rough
[1:10:04] we had a moment
[1:10:06] he turned around to me and he said
[1:10:10] preacher
[1:10:12] i need you to pray for me
[1:10:16] i looked i looked at him and i said
[1:10:18] let's pray right now
[1:10:21] we spent just a bit in prayer
[1:10:27] the next week there was a flood came
[1:10:28] through that place
[1:10:31] floods went across that scrapyard
[1:10:36] and he didn't have nothing to grab a
[1:10:38] hold of so he grabbed a barrel
[1:10:41] and the owner of the scrapyard watched
[1:10:43] him wash down
[1:10:45] the river
[1:10:48] i would be there a couple of weeks later
[1:10:54] the owner of that yard he he told me he
[1:10:56] said we were sitting on two five gallon
[1:10:59] buckets
[1:11:02] we were just talking
[1:11:06] rough is not the word
[1:11:10] and i looked over and tears were running
[1:11:12] down out of his eyes
[1:11:17] i said what's going on he said
[1:11:19] he said you know i never thought jesus
[1:11:21] would come to a place like this
[1:11:26] said this is a rough place
[1:11:28] but jesus was here a few weeks ago
[1:11:31] i said how did he show up he said well
[1:11:34] he said i'll watch back through this
[1:11:36] building i watched you grab a ramen
[1:11:38] and pray with raymond
[1:11:41] and he said i was the one
[1:11:43] that watched him go down the river
[1:11:47] i'm glad i had a moment with raymond
[1:11:51] yesterday i sat at a table
[1:11:54] in blacksburg
[1:11:57] probably one of the roughest individuals
[1:11:59] i know
[1:12:00] sat at the table with me and a bunch of
[1:12:02] other preachers and i call that man my
[1:12:03] buddy
[1:12:06] and he said preacher i want to get saved
[1:12:08] tonight.
[1:12:10] i said why don't we do it today this
[1:12:11] morning he said
[1:12:13] well i want to do it tonight because i
[1:12:14] may not remember it next week
[1:12:23] i'm glad i had that moment with ben
[1:12:27] that i can look back
[1:12:31] and point to some points
[1:12:35] to where that god dealt with his life
[1:12:38] and ministered to his life
[1:12:40] brother william it was so well put
[1:12:44] lighthouses all around him
[1:12:50] the scripture said that god is a refuge
[1:12:53] in strength
[1:12:55] and a very present help in a time of
[1:12:57] trouble
[1:12:59] therefore
[1:13:01] will not we fear
[1:13:03] though the earth be removed
[1:13:05] and though count the mountains be
[1:13:07] carried away in the midst of the sea
[1:13:12] a psalm that we read since we were a
[1:13:15] child brother doug
[1:13:17] the lord is my shepherd and i shall not
[1:13:20] want
[1:13:22] he maketh me to lie down
[1:13:25] in green pastures
[1:13:28] he leadeth me beside of still waters
[1:13:32] he restoreth my soul
[1:13:35] and he leadeth me in the past of
[1:13:37] righteousness
[1:13:38] for his name's sake
[1:13:41] and yea though i walk through the valley
[1:13:43] of the shadow of death
[1:13:45] i will fear no death
[1:13:47] no evil for thou art with me
[1:13:51] thy rod and thy staff they they comfort
[1:13:53] me
[1:13:54] and thou prepares the table before me
[1:13:57] in the presence of my enemies and they
[1:14:00] are known as my head with all
[1:14:03] my comfort over
[1:14:05] surely goodness and mercy
[1:14:08] shall follow me
[1:14:09] all the days of my life
[1:14:12] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:14:13] lord
[1:14:15] forever
[1:14:21] brother doug i i just want to share a
[1:14:23] couple personal things with you
[1:14:26] you set in a service
[1:14:28] here
[1:14:32] and it looked like the lord had called
[1:14:33] you home
[1:14:42] you were gone
[1:14:44] and we had prayer for you
[1:14:47] and you came back to life
[1:14:54] the thing that i noticed about you your
[1:14:56] nature changed you were
[1:14:58] more loving
[1:14:59] more caring
[1:15:02] and god restored a lot of things
[1:15:05] from that time to this time
[1:15:08] he fixed a lot of things
[1:15:11] and he fixed a lot of things with you
[1:15:13] and ben too
[1:15:17] eating our god
[1:15:19] wonderful

[1:15:30] for you
[1:15:32] oh how he loves you
[1:15:35] oh how he watches over your life

[1:15:52] church is not about a building it's
[1:15:54] it's not about a bunch of pews
[1:15:59] church is about meeting god
[1:16:04] a living god
[1:16:06] not some historical god
[1:16:09] this world's coming to an end
