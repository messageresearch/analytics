[37:27] I wondered far
[37:31] from the fold where I was safe. [music]
[37:38] And it wasn't [music] long
[37:42] till I found I'd lost [music] my way.
[37:49] I cried with fear
[37:53] as the [music] night [singing] began to
[37:56] fall.
[37:59] [music]
[38:00] One more lost [singing] lamb.
[38:04] But I heard my shephers
[38:06] [music and singing] call.
[38:12] He saw my [music and singing] steps as
[38:15] they walked. right into the dark.
[38:19] [music]
[38:22] Though I went astray,
[38:26] I never [music] once left his heart.
[38:33] that night long ago.
[38:36] How I [singing] still [music] recall
[38:44] when [music] I lost my way. But I heard
[38:48] the shephers call. [music]
[38:54] He left the phone
[38:57] to search out that one
[38:59] [music and singing] last stray.
[39:04] [music]
[39:05] He left 99
[39:08] for there was one to be saved.
[39:11] [music and singing]
[39:16] There on that ledge,
[39:19] one step would have ended it all.
[39:27] But I felt the hand
[39:30] and I heard the shephers [music]
[39:33] call. [singing]
[39:38] He saw my steps [singing]
[39:41] as they walked [music] right into the
[39:44] door.

[39:52] I never [singing] once left his heart.
[39:57] [music]
[40:00] that night long ago.
[40:03] How I still [singing] recall
[40:07] [music]
[40:11] when I lost my way and I heard the
[40:15] [music] shephers call.
[40:21] He left the fold
[40:24] [music]
[40:24] to search [singing] out that one that's
[40:27] straight.
[40:32] He left [music] 99
[40:36] for there was one to be saved.
[40:39] Hallelujah.
[40:43] And there on that ledge, [music]
[40:46] one step would have [singing] ended it
[40:49] all. [music]
[40:52] But I felt his hand. But I felt his
[40:55] hand.
[40:58] And I heard the [music] shephers
[41:00] [singing] call.
[41:05] Well, they [music] saw my steps as they
[41:09] walked right into the dark.
[41:16] Though I went [music] astray,
[41:20] I never once left his heart. [singing]
[41:25] [music]
[41:26] Oh, you see that night long ago,
[41:30] how I still [music] recall
[41:38] when I lost my [singing and music] way
[41:41] and I heard the shephers call.
[41:46] [music]
[41:49] He saw my steps [music and singing]
[41:52] as they walked right into the dark.
[42:03] I never once [music and singing] left
[42:05] his heart
[42:11] that [music and singing] night long ago.

[42:22] when I [music] lost my way and I heard
[42:26] the shephers call. [singing]
[42:32] Oh, that night long ago,
[42:36] how I still recall
[42:44] when I lost [music] my way and I heard
[42:47] the shephers [singing]
[42:49] call.

[43:26] Aren't you glad you heard the shepherd's
[43:28] call?
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:33] I've been held by the Savior.
[43:40] I [music] felt fire [singing] from
[43:42] above.
[43:47] I've been down to [music] the river.
[43:53] I ain't the same prodal
[43:57] return.
[44:00] [music] And all [singing]
[44:02] my hope is in Jesus.
[44:07] [music]
[44:08] Thank [singing] God my yesterday [music]
[44:13] is gone.
[44:17] And all [singing]
[44:18] my sins are forgiven.
[44:23] [music]
[44:25] Oh, I've been washed by the blood.
[44:33] I'm no stranger [music] to the prison.
[44:41] I've worn shackles
[44:43] and [music and singing] chains,
[44:48] but I've been freed and [singing]
[44:50] forgiven.

[45:47] to [music] his knees.
[45:53] God, you know I've been broken more than
[45:56] a time or two. Yes, Lord. But you

[48:24] [music]
[48:25] to me.
[48:29] Oh, [music and singing]
[48:30] the overwhelming
[48:33] neverending
[48:36] preious love of God.
[48:40] Oh, it chases me [music and singing]
[48:44] down, fights till I'm found, leaves the
[48:49] 99. [music and singing]
[48:52] I couldn't earn it. I don't [music]
[48:55] deserve it. Still you give yourself
[49:00] [music and singing]
[49:01] away.
[49:03] Oh, the overwhelming, [music]
[49:06] [singing]
[49:07] neverending,

[52:03] Oh, it chases [music]
[52:06] me down, fights till I found, leaves
[52:10] [music]
[52:11] the night.
[52:16] [music]
[52:21] You give [music] yourself

[52:38] Are you thankful for the love of God?
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just go to the Lord [music]
[52:41] tonight. Father, we come to you, Lord.
[52:45] We approach your throne of mercy and
[52:46] grace just now, Lord. Father, [music]
[52:49] with our hearts humbled before the great
[52:51] I am. Lord, realizing Lord Jesus, you
[52:54] said in your word where two or three are
[52:56] gathered in my name. There I will be
[52:58] [music] in the midst of them. And
[53:00] Father, we recognize that we are not in
[53:02] this building alone, but the great
[53:04] spirit of Jehovah is here. [music]
[53:07] And Lord Jesus, we just invite you to
[53:09] our life just now to come and minister
[53:11] to us in a specific way. Father, we have
[53:15] been through many trials, through many
[53:17] dangers, and it was your grace and your
[53:19] mercy that was always there running
[53:22] after us. Father, we're so thankful that
[53:25] we could come one more time to the house
[53:27] of God so that you could speak to us,
[53:29] Lord, from thy living word. Now, Father,
[53:32] if we approach you in the right way,
[53:34] Lord, if we respect you in the right
[53:36] way, we believe, Lord Jesus, that you
[53:38] would minister to us, you will speak to
[53:40] us. Lord [music] Jesus, I pray that
[53:43] tonight as you would take us through the
[53:45] scriptures, Father, that you would
[53:47] remind us of how powerful that you are.
[53:50] Lord Jesus, in what you're doing,
[53:52] Father, it can never be stopped, Father.
[53:55] Satan might constantly try to avail and
[53:59] try to prevail against the church of the
[54:01] living God. But you have set a standard
[54:04] up, Lord. [music] And I pray, Father,
[54:06] that you would just push back every
[54:08] every demon power, oh God, that would
[54:10] try to stop your children, [music] every
[54:12] thought of unbelief and doubt and fear.
[54:15] Lord, I pray that tonight that you would
[54:17] come and you would just begin to take us
[54:19] [music] through the work. Father, we
[54:21] love you so much. We believe that you're
[54:23] able and capable of doing above our
[54:27] [music] expectations tonight. I believe
[54:29] that your intentions are great. And I
[54:32] pray, Father, that we would perfectly
[54:33] line up exactly with what you have on
[54:36] your mind, Father. Lord Jesus, [music]
[54:38] we realize that we're in a season of
[54:40] winter, Father. There's certain times
[54:42] and certain seasons. The Bible says
[54:44] there is a season for everything. But
[54:47] there never has been one time where you
[54:49] said in your word there was a season to
[54:51] give up and a season to quit. I pray
[54:53] that this moment, this hour, [music]
[54:55] that we would persevere like never
[54:57] before. move into the promises of God
[55:00] for the things that you have for us at
[55:02] this moment. We love you so much in
[55:05] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. If you have your
[55:08] Bibles tonight, we'd like to look in the
[55:10] book of Genesis chapter 1.
[55:14] Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 and then
[55:17] to Genesis 2 and verse 7.
[55:25] Didn't our brother Jordan do a wonderful
[55:27] job? Amen.
[55:30] I believe I was more nervous for him
[55:31] than he was. So, he just did a
[55:34] wonderful, wonderful job. We appreciate
[55:36] all of our song leaders and our
[55:38] worshippers. Amen. We've been blessed,
[55:41] haven't we?
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] Amen. I'd like to just speak to you a
[55:48] little thought that's been on my heart
[55:49] and maybe we'll just carry it on
[55:51] throughout this Christmas season if the
[55:53] Lord would would so allow us. I'd like
[55:56] to speak to you on I will restore.
[56:00] Genesis 1 and 26. And God said, "Let us
[56:04] make man in our image, after our
[56:07] likeness,
[56:08] and let them have dominion over the fish
[56:11] of the sea, and over the fowl of the
[56:12] air, and over the cattle, and over all
[56:14] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[56:17] that creepeth on the earth." So God
[56:20] created man in his own image. In the
[56:23] image of God created he him. Male and
[56:27] female created he them. And God blessed
[56:30] them. And God said unto them, "Be
[56:32] fruitful and multiply, and replenish the
[56:35] earth, and subdue it, and have dominion
[56:38] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[56:40] fowl of the air, and over every living
[56:42] thing that moveth upon the earth."
[56:45] Genesis 2 and7. And the Lord God formed
[56:48] man out of the dust of the ground, and
[56:51] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[56:53] life, and man became a living soul. And
[56:58] the Lord God planted a garden eastward
[57:00] in Eden. And there he put the man whom
[57:03] he had formed. And out of the ground,
[57:06] God out of the ground made the Lord God
[57:09] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[57:12] the sight and good for food and every
[57:15] and the tree of life also in the midst
[57:17] of the garden and the tree of knowledge
[57:20] of good and evil. Let's jump down to
[57:22] verse 16. And it says, "And the Lord God
[57:25] commanded the man, saying, of every tree
[57:28] of the garden, thou mayest freely eat,
[57:31] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[57:34] evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in
[57:37] the day that thou eatest thereof, thou
[57:40] shalt surely die. And the Lord God said,
[57:44] It is not good that man should be alone.
[57:47] I will make him a helpmate for him."
[57:50] also Joel chapter 2 and verse 25.
[57:59] I will restore to you the years that the
[58:03] locust hath eaten, the cankerworm and
[58:06] the caterpillar and the palmer worm. My
[58:09] great army which I sent amongst you. May
[58:13] God bless his word. You may be seated
[58:14] tonight in the presence of the Lord.
[58:17] Brother Brandham preaches a very
[58:19] powerful message on the end time
[58:22] evangelism. If you haven't listened to
[58:24] it for a while, I advise you to go do so
[58:26] in this hour. Brother Brandham said, now
[58:29] he said, look at here. He said, remember
[58:31] my message recently on the bride tree.
[58:34] See how that they took Jesus? He was a
[58:37] tree, the one that David saw, a tree
[58:40] planted by the rivers of water, his
[58:42] fruit in season, the most perfect tree.
[58:46] And they cut him down and hung him on a
[58:48] man-made Roman tree for a mockery. But
[58:51] what did he do? He rose up again on the
[58:54] third day. What else did he do? He set
[58:56] forth a bride, a tree, a bride tree, a
[58:59] man and a woman, like the trees that was
[59:02] in the Garden of Eden. Two trees. One of
[59:04] them the tree of life and one the tree
[59:07] of death. And what did he do? He come to
[59:10] redeem this tree. So since he redeemed
[59:12] it at Calvary, he's ready to plant her
[59:15] now. So since he redeemed it at Calvary,
[59:19] he's ready to plant her now. He said, "I
[59:21] get to feeling religious when you say
[59:23] that." He said, "To restore his bride
[59:26] tree, the one that should have been in
[59:28] Eden." To think about this tree, this
[59:31] bride that should have been back there
[59:33] in Eden. He said to restore this tree
[59:36] that should have been all the way back
[59:38] there in Eden, but she fell because she
[59:41] disbelieved the word. But here, let's
[59:44] say together, but here he's going to
[59:47] restore a tree that will believe the
[59:50] word. And we realize that this message
[59:52] has came across our paths for just that
[59:55] reason. Is that God wanted to restore a
[59:58] tree, a people, a person that would
[1:00:01] completely believe the word. Brother
[1:00:03] Brandon would teach us that the
[1:00:05] bridegroom tree without the female tree
[1:00:08] could never could never and will never
[1:00:10] produce a fruit or will never bear
[1:00:12] fruit. So it takes a bridegroom and a
[1:00:15] bride to be able to bring forth the life
[1:00:18] or the the fruit that was there. Jesus
[1:00:21] would say in John chapter 15 and5 that I
[1:00:24] am the vine and you are the branches.
[1:00:27] It's the branches that bear the fruit.
[1:00:30] But we realize that it's the life of God
[1:00:32] that goes throughout the branches that
[1:00:34] allows the individual or the person or
[1:00:37] the church to be able to bear that
[1:00:40] fruit. And Jesus said that without me,
[1:00:43] you can do absolutely nothing. So you
[1:00:45] realize that both of the vine and the
[1:00:48] branches, they are born of the very same
[1:00:51] material. The both bride and bridegroom
[1:00:54] in every single aspect of life, they are
[1:00:56] made of the same exact material. When
[1:00:59] you look and when God created man and a
[1:01:02] woman in the beginning, they were in a
[1:01:04] spirit realm. They were in a spirit form
[1:01:07] because God is a spirit and they that
[1:01:10] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:01:13] and in truth. We realize that then God
[1:01:16] made man out of the dust of the earth.
[1:01:19] Notice when he brought forth woman, what
[1:01:21] did he do? He didn't create a different
[1:01:24] person. He simply took that which was on
[1:01:27] the inside of his original creation and
[1:01:30] brought forth that original creation.
[1:01:33] And therefore, Adam called her woman
[1:01:35] because she was bone of his bone and she
[1:01:38] was flesh of his flesh. We realize that
[1:01:41] every single one of us here that none of
[1:01:44] us are sitting here like the Lord Jesus,
[1:01:46] but we were all born in sin and we were
[1:01:49] shapened into iniquity. And we realize
[1:01:51] that our Lord Jesus Christ was the only
[1:01:54] one that ever bore in his own life A
[1:01:58] COMPLETE AND PERFECT BODY THAT NEVER HAD
[1:02:01] NO sin in it that never had disbelief in
[1:02:03] it. He was perfect in every single way.
[1:02:07] We realize this that Jesus if he would
[1:02:10] not have took upon him the form of man
[1:02:13] and died upon a cross that Jesus would
[1:02:16] still be living even right now today.
[1:02:19] Because Jesus was eternal, but you and I
[1:02:23] were made of flesh just like our Lord
[1:02:25] was made, but we come maybe through we
[1:02:28] come a different way. We were not VIRGIN
[1:02:30] BORN, BUT WE REALIZE that in our own
[1:02:32] flesh, we bear the mark of disbelief. We
[1:02:36] bear the mark OF A FLAW THAT HAPPENED
[1:02:39] TWO OR 6,000 years ago, many, many years
[1:02:42] ago there in the Garden of Eden. When
[1:02:45] you were born here, you didn't have
[1:02:47] nothing to do with that sin. But yet you
[1:02:49] was born in that same in that same
[1:02:51] shape. You were born here. YOU NEVER
[1:02:54] WERE TAUGHT TO THINK THE WRONG THINGS.
[1:02:56] YOU WERE NEVER TAUGHT TO SAY THE wrong
[1:02:58] things. But you were born under a fall
[1:03:01] of humanity. YOU DIDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO
[1:03:04] DO WITH WHAT YOU HAD COMING BY YOUR WAY
[1:03:07] BECAUSE ADAM AND EVE SOLD US OUT AS
[1:03:10] HUMANITY. BUT THIS MESSAGE THAT HAS COME
[1:03:12] TO US IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION, A
[1:03:16] MESSAGE OF JUSTIFICATION. SANCTIFICATION
[1:03:19] AND THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND
[1:03:22] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:03:23] HOUR, THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO RESTORE A
[1:03:27] FALLEN BRIDE BACK TO HER RIGHTFUL
[1:03:29] POSITION TO PUT HER EXACTLY WHERE OUR
[1:03:33] LORD JESUS SAW US BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[1:03:35] of the world. AND WHEN YOU look at this
[1:03:37] message, IT IS A MESSAGE OF RESTORATION
[1:03:40] THAT IS CENTERED AROUND THE BRIDE OF
[1:03:42] JESUS CHRIST. THIS MESSAGE CAME TO
[1:03:45] EXPRESS WHO YOU TRULY WERE. AND GOD HAD
[1:03:48] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HIS MIND. AND
[1:03:50] HE REVEALED IT IN A PORTION OF THE BRIDE
[1:03:53] OF JESUS CHRIST. NOTICE THIS MESSAGE
[1:03:56] TAKES US BACK TO A PLACE OF PURITY, BACK
[1:03:59] TO A PLACE BEFORE THE FALL. YOU DON'T
[1:04:02] REALIZE WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS DONE TO
[1:04:04] YOU. SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS TAPES.
[1:04:07] SOME PEOPLE THINK OF IT AS ANOTHER
[1:04:09] CHURCH. BUT THIS MESSAGE HAS RESTORED A
[1:04:12] CHURCH SPIRITUALLY BACK TO A PLACE OF
[1:04:15] EDEN FELLOWSHIP WHERE THE MASTER CAN
[1:04:18] COME DOWN IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING AND
[1:04:21] HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH HIS BRIDE JUST LIKE
[1:04:23] HE WOULD DO WITH ADAM AND EVE WHEN THEY
[1:04:25] WOULD BE STANDING THERE IN A PERFECT
[1:04:27] EDEN. WHEN THERE WAS NO TROUBLE THERE,
[1:04:30] WHEN THERE WAS NO CHAOS THERE, WHEN
[1:04:32] THERE WAS NO STRUGGLES AND NO CANCER AND
[1:04:35] NO SICKNESS AND NO DIABETES AND NO
[1:04:37] STOMACH BUGS AND NO HEADACHES AND NO
[1:04:39] HOSPITALS AND NO LAWYERS AND NO DOCTORS,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; THERE THEY WERE WALKING IN PERFECT
[1:04:45] HARMONY WITH THE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE.
[1:04:48] AND I LOVE I LOVE HOW THE PROPHET I
[1:04:51] THANK GOD FOR THIS MESSAGE, BUT I LOVE
[1:04:53] HOW THE PROPHETS WOULD TEACH US HOW THAT
[1:04:56] HE WOULD SIT THERE AND HE WOULD WATCH
[1:04:58] ADAM AND EVE WALKING IN THE GARDEN. HE
[1:05:00] COULD SEE THEM COMING OUT. EVE WITH HER
[1:05:02] BLONDE HAIR AS IT SHE WOULD LAY HER HEAD
[1:05:05] OVER THERE ON ADAM'S DARK SHOULDER, HIS
[1:05:09] DARK HAIR AND HIS SHOULDER. SHE WOULD
[1:05:11] LAY HER HEAD OVER THERE AND SAID ALL OF
[1:05:13] A TIME ALL OF A SUDDEN AT THE COOL of
[1:05:16] the EVENING THERE THE MASTER OF THE
[1:05:19] UNIVERSE WOULD COME DOWN THROUGH THE
[1:05:21] GARDEN OF EDEN A PLACE WHERE SEEDS WERE
[1:05:25] SUPPOSED TO BE SOWN AT WAS IN THE GARDEN
[1:05:27] OF EDEN AND THE PROPHET WOULD SAY MY
[1:05:30] CHILDREN AND THEY would say YES FATHER
[1:05:34] THEY WOULD SAY HE SAID HAVE YOU ENJOYED
[1:05:36] YOURSELF IN MY CREATION TODAY IS ALL
[1:05:40] WELL. AND THEY WOULD ANSWER BACK, "ALL
[1:05:42] IS WELL. HAVE YOU ENJOYED THE BLESSINGS
[1:05:45] THAT I CREATED FOR YOU?" AND THEY WOULD
[1:05:47] REPLY BACK, "YES, WE HAVE. WE'VE ENJOYED
[1:05:50] WHAT YOU CREATED FOR US." I'D SAY IN
[1:05:53] THIS EVENING TIME THAT THERE IS A WOMAN
[1:05:56] THAT CAN ANSWER BACK AND SAID, "YES, WE
[1:05:59] ARE ENJOYING THE BLESSINGS THAT YOU HAVE
[1:06:01] POURED OUT UPON US." WE ARE IN A
[1:06:04] FELLOWSHIP WHERE THE MASTER OF THE
[1:06:06] UNIVERSE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY IF YOU'RE
[1:06:08] GOING TO FALL OR NOT
[1:06:11] BECAUSE HE SAID, "I WILL RESTORE."
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:18] You can imagine the mindset of the
[1:06:20] Almighty. THIS DID NOT SURPRISE HIM, but
[1:06:24] you can imagine the hurt.
[1:06:27] He knows all things. He sees all things.
[1:06:30] He understands what's going to take
[1:06:32] place
[1:06:34] and he sees them as they're getting
[1:06:37] ready to make the worst decision ever
[1:06:40] made. Ever made. You think you've made
[1:06:44] bad decisions. You think you've made
[1:06:46] some big mistakes. Can you imagine
[1:06:49] living under this one mistake the rest
[1:06:51] of your life? You're the reason why
[1:06:53] there's every hospital. You're the
[1:06:55] reason why there's every little child
[1:06:57] that is born is still born. You're the
[1:06:59] reason why there is paralytics. You're
[1:07:01] the REASON WHY THAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
[1:07:04] MEDICINES AND DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE
[1:07:05] OF your one decision.
[1:07:09] Can you IMAGINE LIVING UNDER THAT SHADOW
[1:07:11] ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE? BUT THANK GOD
[1:07:15] EVE DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THAT. SHE
[1:07:17] DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THAT. AND YOU
[1:07:19] DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER YOUR MISTAKES.
[1:07:21] YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE FAULTS
[1:07:23] AND FAILURES OF YOUR OWN HUMANITY.
[1:07:28] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:30] Adam was in a perfect paradise,
[1:07:33] a perfect place.
[1:07:36] You imagine as a master has longed for
[1:07:40] all those years to come back to a place
[1:07:43] where he could fellowship in the cool of
[1:07:45] the evening time. You see, when you look
[1:07:49] at the reality of our natural birth,
[1:07:52] every one of us were entered into this
[1:07:54] world through a natural birth because of
[1:07:57] Eve's fall. And every one of us, Jesus
[1:08:01] would say in John 3:6 that w that which
[1:08:05] is born of the flesh is flesh. David
[1:08:09] would say in Psalms 51 THAT I WAS
[1:08:11] SHAPING IN INIQUITY and in sinned my
[1:08:14] mother conceive me because of the fall
[1:08:17] in the evening in the Eden there. Every
[1:08:20] single life was born here was born in
[1:08:23] WEAKNESS WAS BORN BY A FALLEN NATURE AND
[1:08:26] EVERY PERSON has limitations because of
[1:08:30] the fault. I'D SAY THAT NONE of you had
[1:08:32] to teach your children how to break
[1:08:34] things. I'D SAY NONE OF YOU HAD TO TEACH
[1:08:36] YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO TELL A LIE AND GET
[1:08:38] INTO THE COOKIE JAR.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE BORN
[1:08:44] WITH. THERE WAS A MARK ON THEIR LIFE
[1:08:47] THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP. HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:50] But I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS THAT THE
[1:08:52] ELECT OF GOD, THEY CARRY SOMETHING
[1:08:55] BEYOND THE NATURAL BIRTH. YOU SEE, YOU
[1:08:58] ARE NOT DEFINED. LET ME SAY AS THE ELECT
[1:09:01] OF GOD, YOU ARE NOT DEFINED BY YOUR
[1:09:04] NATURAL BIRTH. YOU ARE DEFINED BY THE
[1:09:07] GENE SEED OF GOD. BECAUSE JESUS DIDN'T
[1:09:10] STOP THERE IN JOHN 3 AND6 WHEN HE SAID
[1:09:12] THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE FLESH IS
[1:09:14] FLESH. BUT HE SAID THAT WHICH
[1:09:16] [screaming] IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT IS
[1:09:18] SPIRIT.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE SPIRIT THAT BEARETH
[1:09:22] WITNESS WITH OURSELF THAT WE ARE THE
[1:09:26] CHILDREN OF GOD.
[1:09:29] YOU SEE, I refuse TO BE GOVERNED BY MY
[1:09:32] NATURAL BIRTH. I refuse TO BE GOVERNED
[1:09:35] BY MY TEMPER. I REFUSE TO BE GOVERNED BY
[1:09:38] THE OLD MAN BECAUSE GOD, [screaming] A
[1:09:41] DIVINE DEPOSIT, PUT SOMETHING ON THE
[1:09:44] INSIDE OF THE ELECT OF GOD.
[1:09:47] Let me say THIS TO YOU. THE HOLY GHOST
[1:09:50] IS NOT A LEARNED BEHAVIOR. THE HOLY
[1:09:53] GHOST IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU TEACH.
[1:09:55] IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS INHERITED
[1:09:57] BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN IN THE RIGHT
[1:09:59] FAMILY.
[1:10:01] It is an experience.
[1:10:06] The prophet said, he said, "The
[1:10:08] doormat's laid out the welcome mat
[1:10:11] tonight. God's plan of redemption
[1:10:13] through the offering up of the blood of
[1:10:14] the Lord Jesus once and for all to
[1:10:17] cleanse the guilty unworthy sinner to
[1:10:20] bring him into reconciliation with God
[1:10:23] and restore him back into the Garden of
[1:10:26] Eden again in fellowship. He said now
[1:10:29] Jesus come to restore the human race
[1:10:33] everything that he lost in Eden and
[1:10:35] we're on our road. We have the earnest
[1:10:39] of that deliverance. And what was the
[1:10:41] Holy Ghost given for? The prophet said,
[1:10:43] "And then he was made flesh and dwelt
[1:10:46] amongst us in order THAT HE COULD COME
[1:10:49] BACK AGAIN TO man and live in MAN AND
[1:10:52] RESTORE MAN." HALLELUJAH. TO A STATE OF
[1:10:56] COMMUNION WITH HIM AGAIN AND GIVE HIM
[1:10:58] BACK HIS GOD-GIVEN RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:11:01] DID. THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE HOLY
[1:11:05] GHOST. IT'S THE FATHER AGAIN. GOD THE
[1:11:08] FATHER dwelling in you, WORKING OUT HIS
[1:11:10] PLANS TO FINISH, HIS PLANS OF
[1:11:12] REDEMPTION, working for you, MAKING YOU
[1:11:15] A CO-ORKER,
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; A CO-WORKER WITH HIM. SOMEBODY OUGHT TO
[1:11:22] SHOUT, "AMEN." GIVING YOU A PLACE,
[1:11:24] GIVING YOU A PART FOR YOUR FALLEN, lost
[1:11:27] brother and sister, giving you his
[1:11:29] spirit and his love TO GO HUNT THE LOST
[1:11:33] as he did in the Garden OF EDEN. ADAM,
[1:11:35] ADAM, WHERE ART THOU? THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:11:38] HOLY SPIRIT DOES TO A MAN OR A WOMAN
[1:11:41] WHEN IT STRIKES INTO THEIR HEART AND
[1:11:44] TAKES ITS ABODE. THERE'S A THIRST AND A
[1:11:46] HUNGERING FOR LOST SOULS. JUST LIKE THE
[1:11:50] FATHER WAS LOOKING FOR THE LOST ADAM,
[1:11:53] THAT SAME SPIRIT ON THE INSIDE OF THE
[1:11:56] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD IS TO DO THE
[1:11:58] SAME THING. WHERE ARE YOU? WHERE ARE
[1:12:01] YOU? WHERE ARE YOU? THAT'S WHAT THIS
[1:12:04] MESSAGE CAME TO DO. IT'S TO BRING YOU
[1:12:07] BACK.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You see, when God created the earth, he
[1:12:13] created the earth for this one purpose.
[1:12:16] a place that you could habitat, that it
[1:12:19] would BE A PLACE FOR HIS FAMILY, THAT
[1:12:22] THAT WOULD BE THEIR HABITATION. HIS PLAN
[1:12:25] from the very beginning WAS THAT GOD
[1:12:28] WOULD HAVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF God in
[1:12:32] his own image,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; made like him, to think like him, TO
[1:12:38] SPEAK LIKE HIM, TO ACT LIKE HIM. AND
[1:12:41] LUCIFER GOT IN THE DETAILS OF IT.
[1:12:46] I'D HEARD the prophet say it like this
[1:12:48] is that when he was creating Lucifer was
[1:12:52] sitting there and said, "I can do that.
[1:12:56] I can do that. I can do that." You see,
[1:13:00] he had longed for that position
[1:13:04] as he was watching God in heaven. And
[1:13:07] then when God's son, his created son,
[1:13:12] comes here ON EARTH AND HE STARTS
[1:13:15] SPEAKING THINGS into existence, Lucifer
[1:13:18] said, "I can do that, too. I can do
[1:13:21] that, too." BUT LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU.
[1:13:24] THERE IS NO POWER THAT HELL HAS. THEY
[1:13:27] CAN HAVE ALL THE POWERS OF HELL. THEY'VE
[1:13:30] GOT ALL THE DEMONSTRATIONS OF HELL, BUT
[1:13:32] HELL DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE
[1:13:35] ONE MOLECULE, TO CREATE ONE SALE, TO
[1:13:39] CREATE ONE BAD THING OR ONE GOOD THING.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; STOP LETTING HELL WIN IN YOUR LIFE. HELL
[1:13:46] DOES NOT CREATE.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I hear people say, "YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
[1:13:53] THE MESS THAT HELL CREATED FOR ME
[1:13:55] TODAY." ABSOLUTELY CONTRARY. THAT'S THE
[1:13:57] MOST FALSE THING THAT YOU CAN SAY. HELL
[1:14:00] HAS NOT CREATED ONE THING. IF YOU'VE GOT
[1:14:03] HELL ON YOUR JOB, SOMEBODY CREATED THAT.
[1:14:06] NOT THE DEVIL, NOT HIS IMPS, NOT HIS
[1:14:09] DEMONS.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; But what Satan does is get involved in
[1:14:15] the creation and begins to make it fall.
[1:14:18] You see, ever since the beginning,
[1:14:20] Lucifer
[1:14:22] has fought the very plan of God, but
[1:14:25] he's never altered it.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; HE'S FOUGHT AGAINST IT. HE'S ATTACKED
[1:14:30] IT. EVERY SCHEME, EVERY ATTACK HAS NEVER
[1:14:34] OVERTURNED THE VERY MIND OF GOD. SO,
[1:14:37] SATAN MAY OPPOSE YOU, BUT HE'LL NOT
[1:14:39] OVERCOME YOU. SATAN MAY ATTACK YOU, BUT
[1:14:42] HE WILL NOT DEFEAT YOU. YOU SEE, WHEN
[1:14:45] YOU WATCH AS JOB TAKES THESE BINOCULARS
[1:14:49] AND HE starts looking out
[1:14:53] 2,000 years, 2500 years before you ever
[1:14:57] got here, Joel takes the binoculars of
[1:15:01] God's word
[1:15:03] and he would look out there and say,
[1:15:05] "There's modern events going to be made
[1:15:08] clear by prophecy
[1:15:10] [gasps] and there's going to be somebody
[1:15:11] step into it. THERE'S GOING TO BE
[1:15:14] SOMEBODY THAT FULFILLS THE EVENT.
[1:15:17] I want you to know THAT WHEN JOE IS
[1:15:19] WATCHING THIS, he's watching THIS GREAT
[1:15:22] PANORAMIC AS IT'S TAKING place and these
[1:15:25] four bugs come in there, the
[1:15:26] caterpillar, the palmer worm, the
[1:15:29] cankerorm. As they come in THERE AND
[1:15:31] THEY START EATING AWAY AT THE VERY TREE,
[1:15:34] WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS THE SAME BUG THAT
[1:15:37] KILLED the original tree. IS THE SAME
[1:15:40] BUG THAT IS TRYING TO KILL THE BRIDE
[1:15:43] TREE.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID HE DO? HE ATE IT ALL THE WAY
[1:15:46] DOWN. THAT ANTICHRIST SPIRIT, WHAT did
[1:15:49] he do? That Roman Catholic Antichrist
[1:15:53] spirit begin to eat the very life out of
[1:15:56] the bride tree. And you watch as the
[1:15:59] caterpillar went to work and the commer
[1:16:02] and the palmer worm AND THE CANKER WORM
[1:16:04] AS THEY ALL WENT TO WORK. THEY ATE OUT
[1:16:06] BROTHERHOOD. THEY OUT THEY ATE OUT THE
[1:16:09] FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT and it ate it all
[1:16:11] the way down to the roots. But brother
[1:16:14] BRANDHAM SAID THAT THIS CHURCH WAS
[1:16:16] PREDESTINATED FROM THE ROOTS AND SATAN
[1:16:20] HAS NEVER STOPPED IT BECAUSE GOD
[1:16:23] ORDAINED IT.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; ORDAINED IT FROM ITS ROOTS. HE WILL
[1:16:29] NEVER STOP THE ROOT OF THIS PROBLEM. HE
[1:16:31] WILL NEVER STOP THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:16:34] GOD.
[1:16:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:38] THE SAME POWER THAT WAS IN Jesus is
[1:16:42] supposed to BE IN THE BRIDE TREE. THE
[1:16:45] SAME ATTRIBUTES.
[1:16:49] So if they cut down that tree, then they
[1:16:52] will try again to cut down this tree.
[1:16:57] But God said, "I will restore."
[1:17:02] I love what the prophet said.
[1:17:04] This is one of my favorite quotes ever
[1:17:07] in the seven compound names of Jehovah.
[1:17:10] He said, in other words, he said, it is
[1:17:13] what Jehovah is. It's made up in them
[1:17:17] seven redemptive names. His attitude
[1:17:21] towards the people from Eden BACK TO
[1:17:24] EDEN IS WRAPPED up in them seven
[1:17:27] redemptive names.
[1:17:29] And you ever wonder what is God's
[1:17:32] attitude towards my situation?
[1:17:36] Well, if we want to find anything out
[1:17:39] about God, then we've got to look at his
[1:17:41] name. If we want to I'll be honest,
[1:17:44] there's some times in my life where I
[1:17:46] really get to a spot. I wonder how God's
[1:17:48] attitude is with me. And I go to
[1:17:51] remembering what this quote says.
[1:17:54] But his attitude towards his PEOPLE FROM
[1:17:57] EDEN AND BACK TO EDEN IS WRAPPED up in
[1:18:00] them seven redemptive names. Jehovah
[1:18:04] Gyra, the Lord will provide. Jehovah
[1:18:06] Rafa, THE LORD OUR HEALER. JEHOVAH NI,
[1:18:10] THE LORD OUR BANNER. Jehovah Shalom, the
[1:18:12] Lord OUR PEACE. JEHOVAH RAHA, THE LORD
[1:18:15] OUR SHEPHERD. Jehovah Tisanu, THE LORD
[1:18:18] OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. JEHOVAH SHAMA
[1:18:20] [screaming] THE LORD IS PRESENT. THAT IS
[1:18:24] GOD'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOU.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; SO HE IS HIS ATTITUDE IS I WILL PROVIDE.
[1:18:32] I WILL SEE YOUR NEED BEFORE YOU SEE IT
[1:18:35] AND I WILL PROVIDE. I WILL THE I AM THE
[1:18:38] LORD THAT HEALS YOU OF ALL OF THY
[1:18:40] DISEASES. I AM NOT THE AUTHOR OF
[1:18:43] SICKNESS BUT I AM THE AUTHOR OF YOUR
[1:18:46] HEALING. I AM [screaming] THE LORD, YOUR
[1:18:48] BANNER. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU
[1:18:51] ARE MINE.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I am Jehovah Shalom.
[1:18:59] I am your peace. I don't want you to be
[1:19:03] afraid. I don't want you to be in
[1:19:05] torment. I don't want you to be fearful
[1:19:08] because I give you myself.
[1:19:11] LEOA IS FULL of fear. BUT I'M REMINDED
[1:19:16] THIS IS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME. HE IS
[1:19:19] Jehovah Shalom.
[1:19:21] TELL THE DEVIL NEXT TIME FEAR ROLLS ON
[1:19:24] TOP OF YOU. REMIND THAT DEVIL THAT I
[1:19:28] HAVE AN ATTITUDE FROM THE ALMIGHTY.
[1:19:32] Come on, somebody. You know good and
[1:19:34] well the devil gets an attitude WITH YOU
[1:19:36] AND TRIES TO ROLL YOU BACK when you've
[1:19:38] HAD A GOOD DAY ON FRIDAY AND HE TRIES TO
[1:19:40] ROLL YOU BACK TO MONDAY.
[1:19:42] WHY DON'T YOU tell that devil God's got
[1:19:44] an attitude?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; MY GOD'S GOT AN ATTITUDE, SISTER
[1:19:50] GABRIELLE. AND IT'S AN ATTITUDE OF
[1:19:52] PEACE. IT'S AN ATTITUDE OF
[1:19:54] RIGHTEOUSNESS. [screaming]
[1:19:55] I AM JEHOVAH TISKANU, THE LORD THY
[1:19:59] RIGHTEOUSNESS. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? YOU
[1:20:02] CAN NEVER MAKE YOURSELF RIGHTEOUS. BUT
[1:20:04] HE SAID, I AM [screaming] YOUR
[1:20:06] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:20:10] I am Jehovah Shama.
[1:20:15] I am always there.
[1:20:18] That's my attitude towards you. In the
[1:20:21] valley, I'm with you. In the mountains,
[1:20:25] I'M WITH YOU. IN THE GOOD TIMES, I'M
[1:20:28] WITH YOU. AND I SAID IN MY WORD THAT I
[1:20:31] WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AND I WILL NEVER
[1:20:33] FORSAKE YOU. I AM JEHOVAH RAH. I AM THE
[1:20:37] LORD THY SHEPHERD. I WILL LEAD YOU. I
[1:20:40] WILL GUIDE YOU. I WILL COMFORT YOU. AND
[1:20:43] I WILL FEED YOU.
[1:20:46] I
[1:20:48] will
[1:20:49] restore.
[1:20:54] It's amazing how much Leosa wants to
[1:20:57] take away from the church of the living
[1:20:59] God.
[1:21:04] This spirit of this evil age wants to
[1:21:06] put it on the church of the living God
[1:21:08] to make them think that they are alone.
[1:21:10] To make them feel like the message is
[1:21:13] dead and the message has no power. But
[1:21:16] Satan has showed up too late.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; This ain't just the God of William
[1:21:22] Brown. This ain't just the God of the
[1:21:24] days gone by. People try to say that the
[1:21:27] days of miracles are passed. I refuse to
[1:21:30] believe that BECAUSE JEHOVAH HAS NEVER
[1:21:32] CHANGED AND JEHOVAH never will. People
[1:21:36] change, IDEAS CHANGE, BUT GOD NEVER
[1:21:40] CHANGES.
[1:21:41] You see, when God created man in the
[1:21:44] very beginning, he had a mindset about
[1:21:47] them, what they would be, how they would
[1:21:50] act, every little thing. Brother Brandon
[1:21:54] would show us that in every generation
[1:21:56] there is twins of every revival. There's
[1:21:59] church spiritual, there's church carnal.
[1:22:01] You can look all the way back there in
[1:22:03] the Garden of Eden and you see those two
[1:22:05] trees. You see the tree of life and the
[1:22:09] tree of knowledge and good of evil. You
[1:22:11] see Cain and Abel. You see Esau and
[1:22:14] Jacob. And you watch as Jacob as he
[1:22:18] comes to his identity from the natural
[1:22:20] birth. He comes from his natural birth
[1:22:23] and he's there and he has the abilities
[1:22:26] to tell some of the greatest stories.
[1:22:29] You ever met somebody like that? They've
[1:22:31] all I tell you what, I I met this guy
[1:22:33] one time. Went to church. Some of the
[1:22:35] best liars go to church.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; I'm not kidding. This guy would tell you
[1:22:41] anything in the world to tell you
[1:22:43] everything except for the truth. He
[1:22:46] would lie his way out of telling you the
[1:22:48] truth. He would tell people he he played
[1:22:51] with Michael Vic. He was on Frank
[1:22:53] Beamer's squad. Some of the dumbest
[1:22:56] stuff. The guy never looked like a
[1:22:57] football player.
[1:23:00] It's amazing
[1:23:02] just to see if somebody would believe
[1:23:04] it. But here, Jacob is the greatest
[1:23:08] deceiver.
[1:23:10] And I love this is because it seems like
[1:23:13] church people
[1:23:16] have a way of sometimes being deceptive.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; I'm just preaching. I'm not got I ain't
[1:23:21] got nobody in target. I promise you
[1:23:23] that. I'm just preaching from a quote.
[1:23:25] But you look, he's a deceiver. He's a
[1:23:27] shyster. He tells some OF THE GREATEST
[1:23:29] LIES. HE HAS THE ABILITY to pull tricks
[1:23:32] on people and he knows how to make money
[1:23:34] with it. He's good. He's a businessman.
[1:23:37] But notice, HE GETS TO A SPOT WHERE HE
[1:23:40] CAN'T HANDLE IT no more on his own. HE
[1:23:42] IS FIGHTING AGAINST his own flesh. But
[1:23:44] yet ON THE INSIDE OF JACOB, HE REALIZES
[1:23:47] THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL ABOUT HIM. He
[1:23:49] hates WHO HE IS. HE DESPISES THE WAY HE
[1:23:52] IS. HE HATES THE WAY HE TREATS PEOPLE.
[1:23:54] BUT YET, THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE
[1:23:56] INSIDE OF HIM. WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG
[1:23:57] LITTLE BOY, WHEN HIS BROTHER DESPISED
[1:23:59] THE BIRTHIGHT, EVEN THOUGH JACOB WAS A
[1:24:02] GREAT LIAR, THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
[1:24:04] THE BIRTHRIGHT THAT JACOB WANTED.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; You ever GOT TO A SPOT WHEN YOU HATED
[1:24:10] who you were? You couldn't get along
[1:24:13] with nobody.
[1:24:15] You couldn't get along with the boss,
[1:24:17] and you're the boss. You hated who YOU
[1:24:19] WAS. YOU DESPISED IT. YOU HATED IT. And
[1:24:22] you got to a SPOT WHERE YOU GOT TO GET A
[1:24:24] CHANGE.
[1:24:26] But don't worry, we all been there.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. Until you hate who you
[1:24:33] are, you will never have a change.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; People say, "I get tired of going back
[1:24:40] to dirty websites." Until you hate that
[1:24:42] thing,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; you'll keep going back to that thing. I
[1:24:46] hate how I act. I hate how I TREAT
[1:24:48] PEOPLE. I HATE HOW I SPEAK TO PEOPLE.
[1:24:50] YOU WILL ONLY GET A CHANGE WHEN YOU HATE
[1:24:52] THAT THING. AND JACOB GOT TO THAT SPOT
[1:24:56] WHERE HE WAS AFRAID OF HIS BROTHER. HE
[1:24:58] WAS AFRAID OF THE MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE
[1:25:00] LOVED HIM.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; But when Jacob got to a spot, this is
[1:25:07] where you got to get is when you wrestle
[1:25:10] it out with the Almighty.
[1:25:13] Can I keep this? No. Can I have that?
[1:25:17] No. God, I I just want to hold on TO
[1:25:20] THAT. NO. AND FINALLY WHEN HE STARTED
[1:25:23] WRESTLING IT OUT, HE SAID, "I'M NOT
[1:25:25] GOING TO LET YOU GO UNTIL YOU BLESS ME."
[1:25:29] AND WHEN HE WRESTLED IT OUT WITH THE
[1:25:31] ALMIGHTY, WHAT DID JACOB DO? IT RESTORED
[1:25:36] HIS TRUE IDENTITY THAT WAS ON THE INSIDE
[1:25:39] OF HIM BEFORE THE FALL.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; That was who he was supposed to be.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; He was supposed TO BE ISRAEL FROM THE
[1:25:48] FIRST PLACE.
[1:25:50] HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ISRAEL FROM THE
[1:25:53] FIRST PLACE. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE
[1:25:55] BRIDE, NOT THE CHURCH FROM THE FIRST
[1:25:58] PLACE. BUT BECAUSE OF SATAN'S DIRTY
[1:26:01] TRICKS,
[1:26:07] that's why the prophet,
[1:26:10] there's been a lot of people confuse it
[1:26:13] and look out there, but a prophet could
[1:26:16] stand right there in the invisible
[1:26:17] union.
[1:26:19] Only a prophet could do this because you
[1:26:22] know good and well if you had this
[1:26:23] power, you'd run with it.
[1:26:26] You know good and well you would have.
[1:26:28] You'd have run with this. You'd have
[1:26:30] made everything right. You'd have made
[1:26:32] everything you done right. But a prophet
[1:26:34] looked over your life and said, "You're
[1:26:35] justified as if you never done it in the
[1:26:39] first place." I want to REMIND THE
[1:26:41] DEVIL, I AM NOT THE ONE THAT SAID IT.
[1:26:44] YOU ARE NOT THE ONE THAT SAID IT. THE
[1:26:46] PROPHET OF THE LORD WAS INSTRUCTED BY
[1:26:49] THE MIGHTY ANGEL TO SAY TO THEM, "DON'T
[1:26:52] DO IT NO MORE. YOU'RE JUSTIFIED AS IF."
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that spot is? As if.
[1:27:00] It's going back to the days of your
[1:27:02] virgin. Amen.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; There's one spot where brother Brandon
[1:27:08] would talk about a woman, a woman of ill
[1:27:11] fame, where he says, "The blood of Jesus
[1:27:14] Christ can take you back to the days of
[1:27:17] your innocency."
[1:27:30] Hallelujah. Can you imagine the
[1:27:32] Almighty?
[1:27:35] I'm trying not to get ahead of myself
[1:27:37] cuz I feel like preaching right now.
[1:27:44] Can you imagine the Almighty?
[1:27:46] He sees you coming to this.
[1:27:50] You see it when you're riding down a
[1:27:52] road and you know the curve's right
[1:27:53] ahead
[1:27:56] and you wonder
[1:27:58] how am I going to take that curve? Is
[1:28:00] there anybody going to be in that curve?
[1:28:04] Could be somebody on my side. Could be
[1:28:06] somebody around there ready to hit me.
[1:28:11] Let me say this. The Almighty is already
[1:28:12] on the other side of your curve.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; He knows what's coming and he knows how
[1:28:17] to get him out of the way. Let me say
[1:28:19] this to you. You know good and well that
[1:28:21] he's had people in your life that he had
[1:28:23] simply had to just move them off to the
[1:28:25] side because they were getting ready to
[1:28:26] block you.
[1:28:28] I feel like preaching, RIGHT? HE HAD
[1:28:30] PEOPLE THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE GOING
[1:28:32] to be A GOOD CHRISTIAN, GOOD TO BE A
[1:28:34] GOOD PERSON IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[1:28:36] GOD, BUT GOD SAID, "NO, they're going to
[1:28:38] hinder my bride around the curve." So,
[1:28:41] he has them JUST PULL OFF ON THE SIDE OF
[1:28:43] THE ROAD SO THEY WON'T HINDER YOU. GOD
[1:28:46] KNOWS HOW TO PUT PEOPLE IN PLACE AND
[1:28:48] TAKE THEM OUT OF PLACE.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET ME SAY THIS. JOB OR
[1:28:54] JACOB'S CHARACTER WAS WHAT GOD RESTORED
[1:28:57] HIM BACK TO. THAT'S WHAT GOD HAD IN HIS
[1:29:00] ORIGINAL CREATION. That was his
[1:29:02] intention.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; There's a sermon laying right there.
[1:29:05] Heaven's intentions. Let me say this.
[1:29:07] The prophet said, "And I will restore,
[1:29:09] sayeth the Lord." He said, "Here's some
[1:29:11] time ago," he said, "I got a lesson on
[1:29:13] it." God restoring his people. He said
[1:29:15] he'd restore all the former days. And
[1:29:18] he's doing it right now.
[1:29:22] And the people don't realize it. God is
[1:29:24] doing this thing. and the people don't
[1:29:27] realize it. Now, that's in 1954.
[1:29:31] He said, "God is doing this thing right
[1:29:33] now, and the people don't realize it."
[1:29:36] When Mary starts testifying THAT THERE'S
[1:29:39] A CHILD ON THE INSIDE OF ME, I HAD A
[1:29:42] CONFERENCE WITH AN angel of the Lord,
[1:29:44] AND HE'S TOLD ME THAT I'M GOING TO BRING
[1:29:46] FORTH THE SON, AND I'M GOING TO CALL HIS
[1:29:48] NAME JESUS, AND HE'S GOING TO SAVE HIS
[1:29:50] PEOPLE FROM HIS SINS. WHAT WAS IT? GOD
[1:29:52] WAS GETTING READY TO RESTORE CHRISTMAS
[1:29:54] BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE, BUT people
[1:29:57] didn't realize it.
[1:30:01] What was it? It was hid in the veil of a
[1:30:04] woman.
[1:30:06] And there he is again,
[1:30:09] hid in the veil of a bride tree. You
[1:30:14] see, every one of those bugs, all of
[1:30:17] them had the same spirit, same
[1:30:19] anointing, and eat it all the way down
[1:30:22] to the stump. But God said, "Brother
[1:30:24] Haron, I will restore."
[1:30:29] [panting and gasps]
[1:30:30] Notice what the prophet said in the end
[1:30:32] time evangelism. He said, "Endime
[1:30:34] evangelism will be the mark of Malachi 4
[1:30:38] to restore the faith of the people back
[1:30:40] to the faith of the fathers." Yes, sir.
[1:30:42] back to the building stones. YOU SEE,
[1:30:45] THAT'S WHAT MALACHI 4 WAS to do. Was to
[1:30:48] turn the hearts. You talk about a
[1:30:52] turning point. You say, "THIS MESSAGE
[1:30:55] WAS THE FIRST TURNING POINT, BUT PEOPLE
[1:30:58] REJECTED IT."
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE CAME TO RESTORE
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED TO THE
[1:31:07] SAINTS. THAT'S WHY JUDE IS STANDING
[1:31:10] RIGHT THERE AND HE'S CONTENDING WITH ALL
[1:31:12] OF HELL. AND HE SAID, "SAINTS, THIS IS
[1:31:14] WHAT WAS DELIVERED TO YOU. THE SAME
[1:31:16] SEED, THE SAME FAITH.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; It's worth contending for.
[1:31:24] You know good and well that a garden is
[1:31:27] a place that you cast seeds at."
[1:31:32] And this is where he planted
[1:31:36] his seeds at.
[1:31:38] I'd say
[1:31:40] if you could look at it in that realm,
[1:31:42] mothers and fathers, you understand what
[1:31:43] I'm doing here. He places his seat in
[1:31:47] this place. Brother Brandham said the
[1:31:50] only way that it'll never, he said, the
[1:31:51] only way that it'll stay dead is if it
[1:31:54] stays in the wrong place. So, you've got
[1:31:57] to put the seed in the right place. You
[1:32:00] see,
[1:32:02] when Tamar was coming to her position,
[1:32:05] she was coming under her anointing.
[1:32:07] There was somebody that had the ability
[1:32:09] to place seed at the right spot, but
[1:32:12] they refused to put the seed in a place
[1:32:14] where it could live.
[1:32:16] SO, SOMEBODY HAD TO GET THEMSEL IN
[1:32:19] POSITION. THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHERE THE
[1:32:22] MESSAGE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS COMING
[1:32:24] BY YOUR WAY, BUT YOU GOT YOURSELF IN
[1:32:27] POSITION. SO THE SEED OF THE WORD COULD
[1:32:30] BE SOWN IN YOUR HEART BECAUSE THERE WAS
[1:32:32] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF TAMAR THAT
[1:32:35] I'VE GOT TO GET THAT SEED. THAT SEED'S
[1:32:38] GOT TO BE PLANTED.
[1:32:43] Restore the faith back to the children.
[1:32:48] That's what this Malachi 4 anointing was
[1:32:50] to do. Was to restore,
[1:32:54] to return, to bring about. You see, this
[1:32:58] faith that was all the way back there in
[1:33:00] the Garden of Eden is the same kind of
[1:33:02] faith that this bride has right now.
[1:33:08] What was William Brandham operating with
[1:33:11] when he's sitting there at a little
[1:33:13] table and he's sitting there and he's
[1:33:15] telling this magnificent story? He said,
[1:33:17] "All I can say that he is still Jehovah
[1:33:21] Gyra." THAT'S HIS ATTITUDE. AND HE
[1:33:23] CREATE, HE TOLD how he created these
[1:33:25] squirrels, how he done it two times just
[1:33:28] now. And there said a little bitty woman
[1:33:30] over there at that TABLE AND SAID, "HOW
[1:33:33] CAN THESE THINGS BE?"
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; SHE WASN'T QUESTIONING THE MESSAGE. SHE
[1:33:39] WAS QUESTIONING, "HOW CAN I do that?"
[1:33:42] That's what this message HAS DONE TO
[1:33:43] YOU. IT'S NOT MADE YOU WONDER HOW DID HE
[1:33:46] DO THAT? YOU SIT THERE AND SAY, "HOW CAN
[1:33:49] I DO THAT? HOW CAN I SPEAK TO MY SONS?
[1:33:52] HOW CAN I SPEAK TO MY DAUGHTERS? HOW CAN
[1:33:54] I SPEAK TO MY LOST LOVED ONES? I DON'T
[1:33:56] NEED SQUIRRELS, BUT I NEED A RAPTURE. I
[1:33:59] NEED CANCER TO LEAVE. I NEED TUMORS TO
[1:34:02] LEAVE. I NEED PRODALS TO COME BACK HOME.
[1:34:05] I WILL RESTORE THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE
[1:34:09] DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS OF THE LIVING
[1:34:11] GOD."
[1:34:13] WHAT happened when Ananas was over there
[1:34:15] and Saul HAD BEEN BLINDED BY the pillar
[1:34:18] of fire on the ROAD TO DAMASCUS AND THE
[1:34:20] BIBLE SAID ANANAS WENT OVER there and
[1:34:23] laid HIS HANDS ON SAUL AND SAID,
[1:34:25] "BROTHER SAUL, THE LORD HEALTH THEE AND
[1:34:28] TOOK HIM OUT THAT VERY HOUR AND BAPTIZED
[1:34:30] HIM." IT WAS THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE
[1:34:33] DELIVERED TO THE SAINTS.
[1:34:39] My Jesus,
[1:34:42] [sighs]
[1:34:46] brother, that's a faith that was once
[1:34:49] delivered to the saints.
[1:34:53] To believe God,
[1:34:55] his word, regardless of what
[1:34:58] circumstances,
[1:35:00] that has nothing to do with it.
[1:35:05] You know what God's attitude is?
[1:35:08] What about your attitude?
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; You remember what them doctors told
[1:35:13] brother Brandham said when they come in
[1:35:15] there said when a patient has come in
[1:35:17] here and they've got a diagnosis that
[1:35:20] they're going to die with that cancer,
[1:35:22] he said if they take the right mental
[1:35:24] attitude, he said it'll actually
[1:35:26] that cancer case. It'll stop it right
[1:35:29] there in its track. WHERE DID YOU GET
[1:35:32] THAT KIND OF A FAITH AT? Where did you
[1:35:35] get that kind of an attitude at? THE
[1:35:37] BIBLE SAID IN Mark 11:22, "AND JESUS
[1:35:41] ANSWERING SAYING TO THEM, HAVE FAITH IN
[1:35:45] GOD." BROTHER MAN SAID, "WE BECOME A
[1:35:48] part of God because we're born of him.
[1:35:50] And the spirit of God that dwells in us
[1:35:52] is immortal. It has no beginning. It'll
[1:35:55] have no end." And that operating in a
[1:35:57] man gives him faith in his maker.
[1:36:01] the same maker that stood on the earth
[1:36:03] one day and said to that tree no man
[1:36:06] eateth from thee. He went on to say in
[1:36:09] verse 23, Jesus saying, "Verily, I say
[1:36:12] unto you that whosoever shall say unto
[1:36:15] this mountain, Be thou removed, and be
[1:36:18] thou cast into THE SEA, AND SHALL NOT
[1:36:20] DOUBT in his heart, but shall believe
[1:36:22] that those things which he saith shall
[1:36:25] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:36:30] he saith."
[1:36:32] I want you to read that out loud.
[1:36:35] For verily I say unto you, THAT
[1:36:38] WHOSOEVER SHALL SAY UNTO THIS MOUNTAIN,
[1:36:41] BE THOU REMOVED, AND be thou CAST INTO
[1:36:45] THE SEA, AND SHALL NOT DOUBT IN HIS
[1:36:48] HEART, BUT SHALL BELIEVE THAT THOSE
[1:36:51] THINGS WHICH HE SAITH SHALL COME to
[1:36:54] pass. HE SHALL HAVE WHATSOEVER
[1:36:59] HE SAITH.
[1:37:04] [applause]
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; That's the faith that was once delivered
[1:37:08] to the saints.
[1:37:12] Therefore,
[1:37:13] I love when Jesus has a continuation.
[1:37:16] Therefore,
[1:37:18] it always scared me when I was in them
[1:37:20] business meetings and they said
[1:37:22] therefore.
[1:37:25] Sometimes on the other side of that
[1:37:26] therefore, there's some scary things.
[1:37:28] You ever been in a business meeting with
[1:37:30] Ron Spencer and you hear him say
[1:37:32] therefore, I'm glad I'm on his side.
[1:37:35] [panting]
[1:37:36] I've been on the other side of that
[1:37:38] table before the people that work for me
[1:37:40] and I was scared to death for them. I
[1:37:41] was shaking in their boots and I wasn't
[1:37:42] even the one in that trial.
[1:37:49] A lot of them got fired. Thank God I'm
[1:37:51] still here.
[1:37:54] Therefore,
[1:37:56] therefore, on the other side of it,
[1:37:59] THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU, GOD SAYING ON
[1:38:04] THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS business deal,
[1:38:06] whatsoever thingsoever,
[1:38:10] YOU DESIRE WHEN YOU PRAY, BELIEVE THAT
[1:38:14] YOU SHALL RECEIVE THEM, AND YOU SHALL
[1:38:18] HAVE THEM.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "IT AIN'T MY BUSINESS DEAL
[1:38:21] THAT'S BEING DONE. IT'S YOURS.
[1:38:25] You want a million dollars, SPEAK IT
[1:38:26] INTO EXISTENCE. YOU WANT A CATTLE ON A
[1:38:28] THOUSAND HILLS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR
[1:38:30] MIGHTY GOD. YOU NEED BLESSING IN YOUR
[1:38:32] PLUMBING BUSINESS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR
[1:38:34] THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED BLESSING IN
[1:38:36] YOUR HEATING AND YOUR AIR CONDITIONING
[1:38:37] BUSINESS, THAT'S NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF
[1:38:39] GOD. YOU NEED A REGENERATION, THAT IS
[1:38:42] NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF GOD. YOU NEED A
[1:38:44] NEW BIRTH, THAT IS NOTHING FOR THE MIND
[1:38:46] OF GOD. YOU NEED A BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:38:48] GHOST, THAT IS NOTHING FOR THE MIND OF
[1:38:50] GOD. YOU NEED TO BE RESTORED.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; What things?
[1:39:00] When brother Ron put me in business, I
[1:39:03] was 17 years old
[1:39:05] and I'll be honest, it was scary. I
[1:39:09] watched my father allowed me to make
[1:39:12] some thousand mistakes
[1:39:17] and even make a $100,000 mistakes.
[1:39:21] and he knew I was doing it.
[1:39:26] But he saw something on the inside of me
[1:39:28] that I didn't even see myself at
[1:39:30] sometimes.
[1:39:35] You see,
[1:39:38] I'm going to preach to me just for a
[1:39:40] minute about me just for a minute. He
[1:39:43] saw something on the inside of me that I
[1:39:45] didn't see on the inside of myself.
[1:39:48] He knew that I wouldn't give up when I
[1:39:50] made that thousand mistake.
[1:39:53] And I pressed through the thousand
[1:39:55] mistake. And when I got to a spot and I
[1:39:57] lost $56,000 in one night, I didn't give
[1:40:00] up then either. When I lost every single
[1:40:03] thing that I had to my name except for
[1:40:05] $300, I didn't give up then either.
[1:40:08] He realized something on the inside of
[1:40:11] me that I had. No give up on the inside
[1:40:13] of me that I was born to be resilient.
[1:40:15] But let me say this to you. I don't keep
[1:40:17] it there in business realm.
[1:40:20] There were times when I was preaching
[1:40:22] and it seemed like it didn't get over
[1:40:23] the banister right here and it seemed
[1:40:25] like it didn't touch nobody. But he
[1:40:27] didn't give up on me then.
[1:40:30] And he said, "Keep on preaching it. You
[1:40:32] just keep preaching it. You just KEEP
[1:40:33] PUTTING WHAT GOD SAID IN FRONT OF IT AND
[1:40:35] SAY AMEN BEHIND IT. THEN GOD'S OBLIGATED
[1:40:38] TO DO IT." SO I GOT BACK UP THERE AND I
[1:40:40] SAID THE SAME THINGS AGAIN. Was Brother
[1:40:42] Andrew, YOU READ THAT QUOTE LAST
[1:40:44] WEEKEND. YOU SAID THE SAME THING TWO
[1:40:45] WEEKS AGO. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. YOU
[1:40:48] SEE, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I CAN SAY IT. I
[1:40:51] KNOW THAT I CAN READ IT. BUT WHEN THE
[1:40:53] HOLY GHOST GETS BEHIND AN AMEN OF IT,
[1:40:55] THEN IT'LL MANIFEST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
[1:40:58] IT.
[1:41:04] SURE, I MADE SOME COSTLY MISTAKES IN
[1:41:06] BUSINESS, BUT THE HOLY GHOST HAS NEVER
[1:41:08] MADE A MISTAKE WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORD
[1:41:11] OF GOD. HE IS ALWAYS ON TIME. HE IS
[1:41:13] ALWAYS RIGHT IN THE SPOT.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:21] I sat down with a millionaire one time,
[1:41:23] probably a billionaire now.
[1:41:27] Me and him's got about the same story.
[1:41:29] His daddy just had more money than my
[1:41:31] daddy had.
[1:41:33] He said, "My daddy one time let me go
[1:41:36] out to China and make a $2 million
[1:41:38] mistake."
[1:41:40] He said, "But he knew that I would
[1:41:43] experience something great from it.
[1:41:46] and he knew that I'll recover it all.
[1:41:50] I sat down with him and I thought
[1:41:53] there's a principle behind this.
[1:41:56] There's a principle laying there and I
[1:41:58] sometimes I get to mission and things
[1:42:00] and I sometimes I'm just sometimes I'm
[1:42:03] just a hick
[1:42:06] and takes me a little bit.
[1:42:08] The world today doesn't have to go
[1:42:10] through the things that I had to go
[1:42:11] through. They got chat GBT.
[1:42:17] Let me tell you something. These people
[1:42:18] are getting infatuated with this chat
[1:42:20] GBT. It scares the fire out of me
[1:42:22] sometimes. It's good for a quick
[1:42:24] knowledge, but you better ask that
[1:42:26] thing. You better ask that thing if it's
[1:42:28] fabricating something or not.
[1:42:30] I had that thing tell me one. I'm not
[1:42:32] going in chat GBT. God forbid. It's
[1:42:35] good. It's good for what it is. I did
[1:42:38] tell that thing. You ever fabricate
[1:42:39] anything about William Brandham ever
[1:42:40] again, I'll never use you.
[1:42:43] Yes, sir. I understand that loud and
[1:42:45] clear.
[1:42:50] Well, let me say that to you. You ever
[1:42:52] fabricate anything about William
[1:42:53] Brandon? I'll never use you. You ever
[1:42:56] fabricate anything about God's word?
[1:43:00] [applause]
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; You see, you had to come through every
[1:43:09] lie of deception. You had to come
[1:43:12] through everything. You imagine this
[1:43:14] little bride, how that she has come
[1:43:16] through every every toil, through every
[1:43:19] little wave. Brother Brandham said that
[1:43:21] this little bride, he said, "She'll
[1:43:22] crest every wave." You think about every
[1:43:25] wave of every doctrine of every wind of
[1:43:27] doctrine that has hurt, that has hurt
[1:43:30] and has come against the church of the
[1:43:31] living God. But the bride of Jesus
[1:43:33] Christ stays back to one thing that the
[1:43:36] message is the truth. And the angel of
[1:43:38] the Lord always accompanies the message.
[1:43:41] We realize this that when God saw you
[1:43:45] like a little bitty lily coming out of
[1:43:47] the mud of your own life and people
[1:43:49] threw more mud over in that pile, they
[1:43:51] threw belief of sign on it, but you
[1:43:53] still kept rising up. They threw this on
[1:43:56] top of it, but you still kept rising up
[1:43:58] because it was not you. It was something
[1:44:00] THAT THE ALMIGHTY GOD HAD DEPOSITED ON
[1:44:03] THE INSIDE OF YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[1:44:06] OF THE WORLD. Before you could MAKE THE
[1:44:07] RIGHT CHOICE, BEFORE YOU COULD MAKE THE
[1:44:09] WRONG CHOICE, GOD SAW YOU WHEN MEN DID
[1:44:12] NOT CHOOSE YOU. GOD CHOSE YOU.
[1:44:16] THAT WHATSOEVER THINGS YOU DESIRE WHEN
[1:44:19] YOU PRAY, BELIEVE IT AND YOU SHALL HAVE
[1:44:21] IT.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW THAT HE HAD A BUSINESS PARTNER.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; When Mr. skeptic and Mr. IMPATIENT AND
[1:44:30] MR. UNBELIEF, DOUBT IT. HE had somebody
[1:44:34] in business with him that would not give
[1:44:36] up, THAT WOULD NOT GIVE IN, THAT WOULD
[1:44:38] NOT BACK UP. THAT'S WHO GOD [screaming]
[1:44:41] HAS CALLED.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; A people that could be restored back.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; People saw you and had they looked at
[1:44:51] your life, they said, "You'll never make
[1:44:53] it." When they looked at me, the people
[1:44:55] that once knew me and they found out I
[1:44:58] was a preacher, you know what they said,
[1:44:59] brother Ern? They said they didn't know
[1:45:00] that you could ordain the devil.
[1:45:05] But God saw something.
[1:45:08] It's kind of like that violin that was
[1:45:10] up for auction one day
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; AND IT HAD ZERO VALUE TO IT. NOBODY WAS
[1:45:16] WILLING TO SPEND A DOLLAR TO IT. NOBODY
[1:45:18] WAS WILLING TO GIVE 50 CENT TO IT. BUT
[1:45:21] THE MASTER STEPPED UP THERE IN THE
[1:45:24] CORRECT MOMENT.
[1:45:26] YOU KNOW GOOD AND WELL IF IT HAD NOT
[1:45:28] BEEN FOR THE MASTER IN YOUR MOMENT WHEN
[1:45:30] MEN was giving up on you, WHEN MEN WAS
[1:45:33] DOUBTING YOU, HE SAID, "WAIT JUST A
[1:45:35] MINUTE.
[1:46:01] HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:13] Now
[1:46:15] she's ready to play.
[1:46:20] You see, you couldn't play that sweet
[1:46:22] music in that condition.
[1:46:26] So the message of restoration come
[1:46:27] across your life. Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; And he knew how to just put that rosm on
[1:46:33] there, right? because he knows that if
[1:46:36] you don't have that sweet oil of the
[1:46:37] Holy Spirit over your life and somebody
[1:46:39] goes to playing the wrong thing or
[1:46:41] trying to play the thing across your
[1:46:43] life, you'll just blow up and break.
[1:46:46] So therefore, he let the message get to
[1:46:48] you before man could ever get to you.
[1:46:51] When man trying to kick you out of
[1:46:52] church, God said, "Wait just a minute. I
[1:46:54] got to tune it up just a little bit."
[1:46:56] They've been sitting in the closet for a
[1:46:58] little too long, and it's time I know
[1:47:00] they got the ability to do it. I can I
[1:47:02] can tighten it down just a little bit
[1:47:04] more. Preaching on that clothesline
[1:47:06] religion. I No, they can handle it. They
[1:47:08] can handle it. They can handle it. I
[1:47:11] know. I know what they're built to do.
[1:47:13] Nobody thought you was worth anything,
[1:47:15] Brother Teddy. But all of a sudden, the
[1:47:17] master takes his bow across it and he
[1:47:19] starts breathing out amazing grace. How
[1:47:22] sweet the sound that saved a wretch like
[1:47:24] Teddy. Hallelujah. And then all of a
[1:47:27] sudden, you wasn't worth 50 cents no
[1:47:29] more. You was worth a hundred and worth
[1:47:30] 200. Now 3,000. Now 4,000. Who give ME
[1:47:33] 5,000? WHO WHO GIVE ME 10,000? Who give
[1:47:35] ME 20,000? WHO GIVE ME 100? WAIT A
[1:47:37] MINUTE. THAT'S A STRAT OF VARIOUS.
[1:47:39] THAT'S THE GREATEST POSITION THAT A
[1:47:41] MUSICIAN COULD EVER COME TO. I'VE GOT TO
[1:47:44] LET HIM COME TO THIS POSITION BECAUSE
[1:47:46] GOD KNEW WHAT YOU HAD ON THE INSIDE of
[1:47:49] you.
[1:47:51] That's why he let the message
[1:47:54] come by your way. There's some people
[1:47:57] that say it's too hard. They say it's
[1:48:00] too difficult to live,
[1:48:04] but me
[1:48:06] it's everything.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; You imagine
[1:48:14] when Eve makes this terrible mistake.
[1:48:18] She's not a prophet. She don't have the
[1:48:20] ability to have the foresight to see her
[1:48:23] mistake of what it's going to do. that
[1:48:27] in that moment, that one act
[1:48:31] of evil,
[1:48:34] in that moment, every evil thing was
[1:48:36] conceived right there.
[1:48:40] I don't think she looked out here and
[1:48:42] saw Sister Wanda fighting cancer.
[1:48:45] Thank God for a great report.
[1:48:49] I don't think that Eve looked all the
[1:48:50] way out here and saw Brother Ron
[1:48:51] fighting for his life.
[1:48:53] I really don't think that she saw you,
[1:48:55] brother Michael, fighting through
[1:48:56] Leodysia as a teenager's boy. I don't
[1:48:59] believe she had that kind of insight.
[1:49:02] I don't think she had the kind of
[1:49:03] insight, Sister Kimberly, to look out
[1:49:06] there 4,000 years from that moment and
[1:49:08] see a man out there in cave and he's
[1:49:10] bound up with chains. He's bound up
[1:49:13] there. He's possessed. He is completely
[1:49:17] untameable. He's the first streaker in
[1:49:19] the Bible. He is naked. He's afraid.
[1:49:22] He's hiding. He is running away. I'd say
[1:49:25] that Eve did not realize what she was
[1:49:28] doing.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You see, because she listened to the
[1:49:32] wrong tree.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; But one day, the right tree come walking
[1:49:37] by Legion's WAY AND SAID, "I WILL
[1:49:40] RESTORE.
[1:49:42] ALL THE YEARS THAT SATAN HAS ROBBED YOU
[1:49:45] AND CHEATED YOU AND TRIED TO STEAL FROM
[1:49:48] YOU. I [screaming] WILL RESTORE."
[1:49:50] THERE'S A TREE THAT SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:49:52] DIE. BUT THERE'S ANOTHER TREE THAT SAYS
[1:49:55] I WILL RESTORE.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I will restore.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; I got more to go. But I want to close
[1:50:10] out with this little thought.
[1:50:14] Brother Brandon would talk about a man
[1:50:17] and his boat.
[1:50:20] He would talk about a man that was a
[1:50:22] drifter. You remember
[1:50:24] that come by his way and he drifted
[1:50:26] wherever his hat was.
[1:50:28] You remember he said that
[1:50:31] he said it reminded him about that
[1:50:34] little boat. He said it's made out of
[1:50:37] wood and he said it goes around the
[1:50:39] turns of life. And he said, "You see
[1:50:41] that little wood that gets caught in the
[1:50:44] turn down there?" He said, "It's that
[1:50:46] old driftwood." He said, "That's what
[1:50:48] that drifter." He said, "He had no
[1:50:50] ambition about life. He had no power to
[1:50:52] get out of the situations that he was
[1:50:54] in." He said, "It's that like that
[1:50:56] little driftwood. It has no ability to
[1:50:58] get out of the turns of life." He said,
[1:51:00] "But you take a boat that is made out of
[1:51:03] that same kind of wood." He said, "And
[1:51:05] you put a power behind it, like a little
[1:51:06] motor behind it." He said it has the
[1:51:08] ability even though it's trapped up
[1:51:10] against the currents. He said it can get
[1:51:12] its way out of there.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; You remember that little story? That
[1:51:16] little story about that little bitty boy
[1:51:18] that had that sailboat and he absolutely
[1:51:21] loved it. He built it all the way up
[1:51:22] from his little youth. He built it up.
[1:51:25] He loved it. He made everything. He made
[1:51:27] he his mama his mama had made the little
[1:51:30] sails on it and different things and
[1:51:32] he'd spent much time and he spent a lot
[1:51:35] of time with it. He painted it and he he
[1:51:37] he put all that lacquer on it and
[1:51:39] different things and he took it out upon
[1:51:41] the lake one day and the lake got there
[1:51:43] and he had it out there and it was
[1:51:44] floating. Brother Elijah, it was out
[1:51:46] there floating and the wind got a hold
[1:51:48] of it and blew that little sailboat all
[1:51:50] the way across the other side of the
[1:51:52] lake and he lost his little sailboat.
[1:51:54] You see, he looked for it. He loved it
[1:51:56] with everything that was within him. It
[1:51:58] meant something to him. He he had
[1:52:00] created it himself. He'd spent some
[1:52:02] energy in it. He loved it and he looked
[1:52:05] for it everywhere. He went throughout
[1:52:07] life and he was looking for it and he
[1:52:09] couldn't find it. But one day he got to
[1:52:12] walking by a store and he looked on the
[1:52:14] inside of that store in that little
[1:52:16] store and there said his sailboat that
[1:52:18] he created. He looked in there and said,
[1:52:20] "THAT'S MY SAILBOAT. I created that.
[1:52:24] That's mine." And he didn't have the
[1:52:26] money at that time. So he ran back home
[1:52:28] and he got the money out of his piggy
[1:52:30] jar and he got it out. He broke his
[1:52:33] piggy bank and went there and got the
[1:52:34] money and he bought back that sailboat
[1:52:37] that was once his and he got that
[1:52:39] sailboat back in his hand. Hallelujah,
[1:52:42] brother Michael. He got it back in his
[1:52:44] hands. He said, "You are twice mine. You
[1:52:47] were mine when I created you and you're
[1:52:49] mine when I bought you back. You are
[1:52:52] twice mine." That's what the father is
[1:52:54] saying over your life, brother David.
[1:52:56] You are twice mine. You were mine when I
[1:52:58] created you AND YOU WERE MINE when I
[1:53:00] bought you back. Satan put you in the
[1:53:02] pawn store. BUT GOD SAID, "OH NO, MY
[1:53:05] BLOOD IS SUFFICIENT TO RESTORE
[1:53:09] EVERYTHING THAT SATAN'S PUT ON YOUR
[1:53:12] LIFE. [screaming] I WILL RESTORE. YOU
[1:53:15] are twice mine." [applause]
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Won't you stand?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; I'm twice his.
[1:53:26] I'm twice his.
[1:53:34] There's a lot of people that go mincing
[1:53:35] down the street. There's a lot of people
[1:53:37] go along the way.
[1:53:40] Remember them little ladies, Brother
[1:53:42] Brandham saw in that hotel that time and
[1:53:44] they was up there screaming, "Whoopee!"
[1:53:46] He says, "Life." He said, "That ain't
[1:53:48] life. That's death." There's a lot of
[1:53:50] people going down the street mincing
[1:53:52] like Penny Pentecostal does going down
[1:53:55] the street.
[1:53:57] But there's something different about
[1:53:58] the way that you walk to this message.
[1:54:02] Hallelujah. It's something powerful
[1:54:06] behind the eye.
[1:54:10] You see, because I can say I'm going to
[1:54:11] do something. Lucifer can say that I'm
[1:54:14] going to do something. I will make
[1:54:16] myself like the most high God.
[1:54:19] But there's something powerful about
[1:54:20] when God says, "I
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; I will restore."
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read this quote.
[1:54:35] I've been going through question and
[1:54:36] answers.
[1:54:38] I'm just thinking on these things and
[1:54:40] just think about our young people.
[1:54:43] Young people, if you don't know the
[1:54:44] message, you want to learn more about
[1:54:45] it, go through question and answer.
[1:54:46] Brother Brandham says some very powerful
[1:54:48] things. So I've been going through those
[1:54:50] things trying to grab some nuggets from
[1:54:52] here and there to maybe encourage him.
[1:54:54] Brother Brandham has asked this question
[1:54:56] in questions answers said I've lived
[1:54:58] many years in sin until I found the
[1:55:00] Lord. Brother Brandham, I have sinned
[1:55:03] again and I'm not worthy to come before
[1:55:06] you in this holy place.
[1:55:09] Please tell me if I can be restored
[1:55:12] whole again.
[1:55:15] Let me say this to you. You come to this
[1:55:18] message, you come to the right spot.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Please tell me if I can be restored
[1:55:23] whole again.
[1:55:25] You ever had that kind of wondering what
[1:55:28] God attitude is? Please tell me,
[1:55:32] can I be restored
[1:55:35] whole again? Not broken, not put back
[1:55:39] together,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; but whole. Can I be restored? You see,
[1:55:44] there are certain things about me when I
[1:55:46] go to putting something back together,
[1:55:48] you'll see all the cracks. You'll see
[1:55:50] the glue. You'll see the tape. But when
[1:55:53] God puts something back together,
[1:55:56] you don't see the glue. You don't see
[1:55:57] the residue. You don't see the scar
[1:56:00] because God's a healer. Please tell me,
[1:56:04] can I be restored whole again? I'm so
[1:56:09] thankful that this brother or sister
[1:56:10] asked this question.
[1:56:12] Yes,
[1:56:14] you have not sinned, my friend, so far
[1:56:16] in God, but what you could be restored.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; If you had sinned so far that you could
[1:56:24] not be restored, you'd never want to be
[1:56:27] restored.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; But as long as there's something dealing
[1:56:32] with your heart,
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; you're still in line for restoration.
[1:56:39] As long as there's something dealing
[1:56:42] with your heart,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; you're still in line for restoration. I
[1:56:48] say this to you, don't you give up.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you give up. They ain't in the
[1:56:52] line of McDonald's and Wendy's and all
[1:56:54] these. They are in line for restoration.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; You hear me? They are in line for
[1:56:59] restoration. And you just wait. If it
[1:57:03] wasn't God dealing with their heart,
[1:57:05] then they would not even be in the line.
[1:57:07] BUT BECAUSE THE FATHER HAS THEM IN HIS
[1:57:10] MIND, HE'S GOT THEM RIGHT in line.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT IN LINE.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE SAYING? IT'S A CHURCH THAT IS
[1:57:20] GETTING BACK IN STEP.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:57:28] I
[1:57:30] will.
[1:57:33] I will.
[1:57:37] I wonder if we had to go to bed tonight
[1:57:40] and this was the last thing that the
[1:57:43] father would speak to us.
[1:57:46] Three words.
[1:57:48] I
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; will
[1:57:51] restore.
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; Joy has been taken from you. I will
[1:57:57] restore.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Peace has been taken from your home. I
[1:58:02] will restore. Faith has been robbed from
[1:58:05] you. I will restore. Your father, your
[1:58:10] husband, your mother, your sister, your
[1:58:12] brother. I will restore.
[1:58:17] I'd say it's time that you do like
[1:58:19] little David
[1:58:22] when everything's been robbed from you.
[1:58:26] The Bible said that David was greatly
[1:58:28] distressed because the people
[1:58:31] talked about stoning him.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; But David didn't sit down in defeat.
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that David looked over
[1:58:42] there by heart and said, "Would you mind
[1:58:45] bringing me an ephod?"
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; WHAT DID DAVID DO IN THE WORST OF TIMES?
[1:58:51] HE SAID, "Bring me the place where I can
[1:58:53] worship." RIGHT.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; BRING ME BACK TO A HEART OF WORSHIP.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE DAVID REALIZED
[1:59:01] THAT I WILL BLESS THE LORD AT ALL TIMES.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; DAVID DIDN'T SIT DOWN IN DEFEAT when
[1:59:09] everybody was AGAINST HIM.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; DAVID INQUIRED OF THE LORD
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; AND HE ENCOURAGED HIMSELF.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; What did he encourage himself in? Psalms
[1:59:21] 51. I will restore restore unto you the
[1:59:25] joy of thy salvation.
[1:59:28] I WILL [screaming] LIFT UP MY VOICE TO
[1:59:30] THE ALMIGHTY AND HE WILL INCLINE HIS EAR
[1:59:33] TO MY HEART.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; David encouraged himself in the words of
[1:59:39] the Almighty.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; And I love what David asked.
[1:59:45] God,
[1:59:48] should I go after that need? Should I go
[1:59:51] after that little lamb? Should I go
[1:59:54] after my wife? Should I go after my
[1:59:57] possessions, my cattle, my sheep, my
[1:59:59] land, my daughters?
[2:00:03] And God said one word, pursue.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; That's all David needed.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; That's all David needed.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; I say that's all you need.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Pursue. The enemy's taken that from you.
[2:00:16] Pursue. And then God comes behind it and
[2:00:19] says, "Don't just get it some back.
[2:00:22] Don't just get your money back. Don't
[2:00:24] just get your wife back. Don't just get
[2:00:26] your joy back. Don't just get your dance
[2:00:28] back. Just don't get your shout back.
[2:00:31] Recover it all.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; I will
[2:00:38] restore."
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; I know God speaking to your heart.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; I know that.
[2:00:47] So refuse to stay in a dead condition.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts. Father,
[2:00:57] you realize the power of this moment
[2:00:59] that we're in.
[2:01:02] Eve didn't realize the power of the
[2:01:04] moment she was in.
[2:01:07] Lord,
[2:01:09] if we could realize the power of our
[2:01:11] choice right here, right now [music]
[2:01:13] from our heart, the things that we'll
[2:01:15] decide.
[2:01:18] Lord,
[2:01:22] if Eve could have [music] put a scale
[2:01:24] over there beside her on this decision
[2:01:26] or that decision,
[2:01:28] do I do it? Do I not?
[2:01:30] God, your plan had to [music] be
[2:01:33] unfolded.
[2:01:35] I wonder if we realize the power of our
[2:01:38] choice right now.
[2:01:40] What would take place? What would
[2:01:42] happen?
[2:01:44] Lord, the Bible would say
[2:01:52] because of [music] one sin,
[2:01:54] that one person couldn't enter into the
[2:01:56] congregation
[2:01:57] because of that one choice for 10
[2:02:00] generations.
[2:02:01] And the prophet said, "What about a
[2:02:02] [music] positive choice?"
[2:02:05] Father,
[2:02:06] I wonder what would take place right now
[2:02:08] if we just start speaking things into
[2:02:10] existence that whatsoever [music] things
[2:02:12] we desire when we pray, we believe that
[2:02:15] we shall have them.
[2:02:17] If Eve by that powerful of decision
[2:02:20] could sit there [music] and say, "I
[2:02:22] choose to take on that seed."
[2:02:25] What would happen when we would sit here
[2:02:27] and say, "I don't want to take on God's
[2:02:28] seed.
[2:02:30] I want to let it fully manifest his
[2:02:32] glory in my life and express the [music]
[2:02:35] Godhead deity through me. Father, what
[2:02:38] would happen if moms and daddies got to
[2:02:40] back [music] to praying and made a
[2:02:41] decision? What would happen? I could say
[2:02:45] this.
[2:02:47] The father would say, "I will restore."
[2:02:50] Lord, I pray [music] tonight for every
[2:02:53] person here and under the sound of my
[2:02:55] voice.
[2:02:57] Lord, my hand, my heart, everything
[2:02:59] about me is before you. Lord, I don't
[2:03:03] even [music] have to ask you,
[2:03:06] but Lord, I'm going to go pursue it and
[2:03:08] I'm going to recover it all. Father,
[2:03:11] restore unto me the joy of my salvation.
[2:03:16] Father,
[2:03:17] we could ask him to step out
[2:03:20] and Lord, [music] you see their hearts
[2:03:21] just now. And I pray Lord the master of
[2:03:26] the universe would go across their
[2:03:28] [music] life just now and let the word
[2:03:31] take the bow of thy word and stream it
[2:03:33] across [music] their life
[2:03:36] in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:03:40] Never [music] will I praise you. You're
[2:03:43] the healer of my heart.
[2:03:49] [music and singing]
[2:03:51] Healer of the broken pieces.
[2:03:56] [music and singing]
[2:04:00] You touch this
[2:04:02] [music] made it new.
[2:04:09] Now my [music and singing] whole life I
[2:04:12] surrender.
[2:04:13] Lay it down before the men.
[2:04:17] [music and singing]
[2:04:26] Oh, love the sought before I knew you
[2:04:35] has brought [music] me near to where
[2:04:38] [singing]
[2:04:38] you are.
[2:04:44] Oh, [music] now I live
[2:04:47] to praise you.
[2:04:50] Oh, wherever may I praise you? [music]
[2:04:54] You're the healer of my heart. Let's
[2:04:59] have that verse [music] one.
[2:05:02] Oh.
[2:05:05] [music]
[2:05:12] [music]
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; Make
[2:05:25] of all we are.
[2:05:34] I was [singing] the
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; vessel in [singing] your hand.
[2:05:50] [music]
[2:05:51] You looked beyond the hurt and [singing]
[2:05:55] made me whole
[2:05:59] again.
[2:06:05] Healer of the broken pieces.
[2:06:09] [music and singing]
[2:06:14] You touched my heart and made
[2:06:17] [music and singing] it new.
[2:06:23] Now my [singing] whole life I surrender.
[2:06:26] [music]
[2:06:28] Lay it down before the mener. [singing]
[2:06:32] Lord, I give my life [music]
[2:06:35] to you.
[2:06:41] The love [music and singing] I saw
[2:06:43] before I knew you
[2:06:49] [music] has brought me near to where you
[2:06:54] are.
[2:06:55] [music]
[2:06:59] Now I live
[2:07:02] to praise [music and singing] you
[2:07:04] and ever may I praise you. You're the
[2:07:09] healer [singing] of my heart.
[2:07:14] Once again,
[2:07:17] healer [singing] of the broken [music]
[2:07:21] pieces.
[2:07:26] You touched my heart and made [singing]
[2:07:29] it new. [music]
[2:07:35] Now [music and singing] my whole life I
[2:07:38] surrender.
[2:07:40] Lay it [music] down before the [singing]
[2:07:43] mener. Lord, I give my life to [music]
[2:07:48] you.
[2:07:53] The love I saw [music]
[2:07:55] before I knew [singing] you
[2:08:01] [music]
[2:08:02] has brought me near to where you are
[2:08:12] [music] now. I live
[2:08:15] to praise you.
[2:08:18] Ever may I praise you. You're [music]
[2:08:22] the healer of my heart.
[2:08:30] The [music] love I [singing] sought
[2:08:32] before I knew you
[2:08:39] has brought me near [music] to where you
[2:08:43] are
[2:08:45] [singing]
[2:08:45] [music]
[2:08:49] now. How I live
[2:08:52] to praise you. [music and singing]
[2:08:55] Ever may I praise you. You're the healer
[2:09:00] of [music] my heart.
[2:09:05] Now I live to praise you.
[2:09:10] And ever may I praise
[2:09:12] [music and singing] you. You're the
[2:09:14] healer of my heart. [music and singing]
[2:09:18] heart.
[2:09:21] Is he the healer of your heart tonight?
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that he can come
[2:09:25] down and [music] mend the broken pieces
[2:09:27] in your life? No matter what it is in
[2:09:30] your life that's broken, he can fix it.
[2:09:34] Amen.
[2:09:41] You give life. [singing and music]

[2:16:33] And who told [music] the ocean,
[2:16:37] "You can only come [singing] this far."

[2:16:51] where to hide [singing] to leave
[2:16:59] stand.

[2:17:47] The very same God
[2:17:51] that spins things [music] in orbit.
[2:17:58] He runs to the weary,
[2:18:01] the worn, and [music and singing] the
[2:18:04] weak.
[2:18:09] And the same [music] gentle hands
[2:18:15] that hold me when I'm broken.
[2:18:20] They conquer [music] death to bring me
[2:18:24] victory.
[2:18:29] Yes, [music] I know
[2:18:33] our redeemer
[2:18:36] lives.
[2:18:40] Yes, I [singing and music] know
[2:18:43] my redeemer
[2:18:46] he lives.
[2:18:50] Let all creation
[2:18:53] testify.
[2:18:56] Let this life within me cry.
[2:19:01] Yes, I [music and singing] know
[2:19:04] my redeemer
[2:19:07] lives
[2:19:09] to take away our shame
[2:19:13] and he lives
