[28:41] and all the while she pulls us all away
[28:45] from everything
[28:47] divine
[28:52] but i have heard a voice
[28:56] calling me out of babylon

[52:44] who of us here
[52:47] has not asked at times
[52:50] about the afflictions and the
[52:52] difficulties
[52:55] does god care about me
[53:01] the psalmist david
[53:03] says
[53:04] refuge failed me
[53:07] no man carried cared for for for my soul
[53:12] martha became over-concerned
[53:15] with her own workability days that she
[53:18] had
[53:20] and she even asked jesus lord do you
[53:22] care
[53:27] i am preaching to human beings
[53:32] how many faithful loving mothers that
[53:34] sit here
[53:36] become overwhelmed by the burdens of of
[53:39] babies with fevers
[53:42] sicknesses and earaches and tooth teeth
[53:45] coming in
[53:46] and they come to the point of exhaustion
[53:52] and they ask do you care
[53:56] you care
[53:58] being human beings that are sitting
[54:00] before us today we struggle with our dna
[54:04] we struggle with our thoughts we
[54:06] struggle with our negative thinkings
[54:10] we struggle with our own paranoia
[54:13] we struggle with our own indifferences
[54:16] and
[54:17] jealousies and
[54:23] gossips
[54:28] i know we're in church but you struggle
[54:29] with it
[54:33] satan will get divide you because he's a
[54:35] divider
[54:37] when we're supposed to be a body he
[54:39] tries to divide us he tries to pull us
[54:41] apart
[54:43] he gets little indifferences and little
[54:45] words and and he just kind of gets
[54:47] little feelings
[54:49] well that person looked at me a certain
[54:51] way
[54:54] yeah i'm preaching the right group i can
[54:56] see it right now
[55:02] but god knew
[55:05] in your first nature you couldn't
[55:07] overcome the enemy
[55:09] when jesus turns around to nicodemus he
[55:12] told him he said you must be born again
[55:15] now nicodemus understood scriptures
[55:18] he sat with great counsels he sat with
[55:21] great men
[55:22] but nicodemus knew that there had to be
[55:25] more
[55:27] i pray this morning that there's
[55:28] something on the inside of you that says
[55:31] i gotta have more of god i've got to
[55:33] have more of his word i need a refilling
[55:36] of the holy spirit in my life
[55:40] i challenge you to go beyond our flesh
[55:44] brother branham would remind us of the
[55:45] plane that would go beyond the brake the
[55:48] sound the sound barrier and he said it
[55:50] would get up to a certain level and
[55:53] almost shake apart and they would back
[55:54] off and it would get up to a certain
[55:56] level and it would almost shake apart
[55:58] felt like the plane was going to fly
[56:00] apart and they would back off but one
[56:03] day they broke through that thing
[56:06] i pray to god that we can break through
[56:08] the barrier of every sin
[56:11] every human feeling and break through it
[56:23] george washington was persistent at
[56:25] valley forge
[56:28] all the odds were against him
[56:31] the enemy had crossed was across the
[56:33] river
[56:35] but after all night in prayer the
[56:37] american soldiers with no shoes on their
[56:40] feet
[56:41] about one-third of them had shoes
[56:44] they crossed the river at valley forge
[56:46] through the ice
[56:48] three musket bullets
[56:51] went through george washington's coat
[56:55] and he had it becau but he had an answer
[56:58] from god
[56:59] and there was no need of him backing
[57:02] down
[57:06] nothing could stop him
[57:10] he crossed it because he was persistent
[57:13] he had heard from god
[57:18] and that's the way that we've got to be
[57:22] if god said so
[57:24] that settles it
[57:27] reminds you of the scriptures no weapon
[57:29] that is formed against thee shall
[57:32] prosper
[57:34] and every tongue that shall arise in the
[57:37] judgment
[57:38] thou
[57:39] shalt condemn
[57:40] philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 being
[57:44] confident of this very thing
[57:46] that he
[57:48] which hath begun a good working
[57:55] i think sometimes we just go across that
[57:57] scripture and go
[57:59] well that's that's a nice scripture
[58:01] understand who began that good work
[58:06] it wasn't your favorite preacher that
[58:08] began the good work
[58:10] this is not a club
[58:14] this is not a club where you just quit
[58:16] when you get tired of it
[58:19] this is not a social order
[58:22] of the knights of columbus or the masons
[58:26] or
[58:28] the odd fellas we're the elected
[58:31] born-again bride of jesus christ
[58:34] we have been sent here to have victory
[58:37] in our lives
[58:44] the scripture says in 4 in philippians 4
[58:47] and verse 13 i can do all things
[58:51] i want you to say that with me i can do
[58:54] all things
[58:57] through christ which strengthens me
[59:04] well thank god for the 10 that showed up
[59:08] i want you to read it with me again i
[59:11] can do all things
[59:21] say it again until you believe it
[59:32] it doesn't say your preacher
[59:35] it does not say your favorite thing
[59:38] it's for you
[59:40] this is god's word for you
[59:43] sure you got job situations sure you got
[59:46] difficulties in your lives sure there's
[59:49] family problems that come up sure
[59:51] there's financial matters that you've
[59:53] got to struggle through but the
[59:55] scripture
[59:56] does not have a time date stamp on it i
[59:59] can't do all things
[1:00:14] beloved think it not strange concerning
[1:00:17] the fiery trial which is to try you
[1:00:21] as though some strange thing happened
[1:00:23] unto you
[1:00:25] but rejoice
[1:00:28] ends as much as ye are partakers of
[1:00:31] christ's suffering that which his glory
[1:00:34] shall be revealed in you
[1:00:37] be glad
[1:00:40] also with exceeding
[1:00:42] joy
[1:00:44] ephesians chapter 6

[1:01:16] wimps
[1:01:21] be strong in the lord in the power of
[1:01:23] his might
[1:01:25] put on the whole armor of god that you
[1:01:27] may be able to stand
[1:01:29] against the wiles of the devil for we
[1:01:31] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:01:34] against principalities against powers
[1:01:37] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:01:39] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:01:42] in high places
[1:01:46] jude chapter 1 and verse 24
[1:01:49] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:01:52] from fallen

[1:02:18] from falling
[1:02:24] the scripture says in isaiah 40 and
[1:02:26] verse 31 but they that wait upon the
[1:02:29] lord shall renew their strength
[1:02:34] they shall mount upon wings as eagles
[1:02:37] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:02:40] shall walk and not faint
[1:02:43] read it with me but they that wait upon
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:46] lord shall renew their strength
[1:02:49] they shall mount upon wings as eagles
[1:02:52] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:02:55] shall walk and not think
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:03] psalms 91 and verse 5
[1:03:06] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:03:08] by night nor the error that flieth by
[1:03:11] day nor the pestilence that walketh in
[1:03:14] darkness nor the destruction that wastes
[1:03:16] it that noon day a thousand shall fall
[1:03:19] at thy side and ten thousand at thy
[1:03:22] right hand
[1:03:23] but it shall not come now thee only with
[1:03:26] thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the
[1:03:28] reward of the wicked because thou has
[1:03:31] made the lord which is my refuge even
[1:03:34] the most high thy habitation
[1:03:39] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:03:42] shall any plague come now thy dwelling
[1:03:45] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:03:47] thee to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:03:52] listen this is either good poetry or
[1:03:55] it's god's word
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:04:06] hallelujah
[1:04:09] yeah though i walk through the valley of
[1:04:11] the shadow of death
[1:04:13] i will fear no evil
[1:04:17] for thou art with me
[1:04:20] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:04:23] i stand here preaching before you today
[1:04:27] with cells of my body trying to destroy
[1:04:30] this flesh
[1:04:32] fear does not encompass me
[1:04:37] a lot of people get a toe ache and
[1:04:38] they're ready to quit the battle
[1:04:41] somebody didn't shake my hand somebody
[1:04:43] didn't smile somebody's upset with me
[1:04:46] grow up
[1:04:48] grow up
[1:05:04] david
[1:05:14] this ain't drama class 101
[1:05:19] where your whole life is just drama
[1:05:22] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:05:25] we're warriors
[1:05:32] this ain't where we decide we're going
[1:05:34] to go so far and all of a sudden we we
[1:05:36] quit
[1:05:38] [Music]
[1:05:39] we're wires here
[1:05:47] if i've taught you anything as a body of
[1:05:49] believers
[1:05:54] it's when you're in the midst of a
[1:05:56] battle
[1:05:58] you don't run
[1:06:04] you don't bellyache about how bad it is
[1:06:08] you fight
[1:06:10] and you don't fight with your flesh you
[1:06:12] fight with the word of god
[1:06:14] because that's the only thing that will
[1:06:16] defeat the devil
[1:06:19] you don't fight with your emotions you
[1:06:21] don't fight with your ability of
[1:06:23] strength you fight with the word of god
[1:06:26] because your mouth
[1:06:29] has the power of life and death in it
[1:06:32] and if you utter the words of god's word
[1:06:36] satan has felt the sting of that sword
[1:06:38] over and over again
[1:07:00] i want to read that scripture again
[1:07:03] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:07:05] shadow of death
[1:07:08] i will fear no evil
[1:07:13] thou art with me
[1:07:15] thy rod and thy staff that comfort me
[1:07:22] sister connie's been with me brother
[1:07:24] matthew's been with me
[1:07:25] and heard the doctors ask how much
[1:07:28] longer do you want to fight
[1:07:30] how much longer you want to keep taking
[1:07:32] this chemo
[1:07:35] i'm not quitting
[1:07:38] i didn't come to this battle to quit
[1:07:47] and neither did i come to this battle to
[1:07:49] wine
[1:07:53] as a matter of fact i don't even need
[1:07:55] you pitying me
[1:07:57] or feeling sorry for me
[1:08:00] because god had confidence
[1:08:02] in me
[1:08:05] before this battle ever came
[1:08:08] so our confidence is not in the flesh
[1:08:11] our confidence is in god
[1:08:15] now i'm not just saying that about
[1:08:17] myself there's brothers and sisters that
[1:08:19] fight an incredible battle now i want to
[1:08:22] say to you today you may be laying in
[1:08:24] the bed and feel like the death is
[1:08:27] swirling around you just take the word
[1:08:30] of god
[1:08:33] just take the word of god
[1:08:35] there's angels that are standing there
[1:08:38] you fight through the darkness
[1:08:40] [Applause]
[1:08:48] year of god little children
[1:08:51] and i've overcame them
[1:08:54] are you with me now because greater is
[1:08:56] he that is in you
[1:08:59] than he that is in the world
[1:09:02] any of you that's ever taken physics
[1:09:04] knows that greater means
[1:09:07] that the greater is greater than the
[1:09:09] lesser
[1:09:11] so satan is in the lesser kingdom
[1:09:15] and that means that our god is greater
[1:09:18] than every devil that's in hell
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:20] [Applause]
[1:09:28] finally my brethren
[1:09:32] be strong in the lord
[1:09:40] and in the power
[1:09:41] of his might
[1:09:44] i know i just read it
[1:09:46] but i noticed that you didn't get it
[1:09:49] finally my brethren
[1:09:55] be strong in the lord
[1:09:59] and the power of hysmoth
[1:10:06] hebrews 12 and verse 1
[1:10:09] wherefore
[1:10:11] see and we're also compassed about with
[1:10:13] so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:10:16] let us lay aside every pity party
[1:10:21] every indifferent feeling
[1:10:24] every ugliness of our humanity
[1:10:28] bridle our tongue bridle our mind
[1:10:36] you ever been around anybody that
[1:10:38] everybody's got something against them
[1:10:45] i worked with a man for about 12 years
[1:10:49] and he was eat up with paranoia
[1:10:52] we was at a large meeting one day and
[1:10:56] and he was sitting beside him he was
[1:10:57] about 60 years old at that point
[1:11:02] we were sitting in the
[1:11:04] the nitroglycerin section office and
[1:11:08] he said see there said he's looking at
[1:11:10] me
[1:11:16] superintendent is looking at me this
[1:11:18] whole meeting's about me
[1:11:23] and i'm gonna tell i told him what i'm
[1:11:25] going to tell you get over yourself
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:32] get over yourself you're not that
[1:11:34] important
[1:11:39] the world i want to give you some shock
[1:11:41] value the world does not revolve around
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:55] it don't revolve around you
[1:11:59] get up
[1:12:01] get over yourself and become a
[1:12:02] productive citizen in the kingdom of god
[1:12:10] help somebody else
[1:12:13] get enough victory about you that you
[1:12:15] can have a victory and a testimony to
[1:12:18] another person
[1:12:33] it's good eh
[1:12:35] this is why the devil making me so sick
[1:12:37] this morning
[1:12:43] if i counted right
[1:12:46] i up chucked eight times before i walked
[1:12:48] to this pulpit
[1:12:50] i don't know probably hardly any other
[1:12:52] person that would have walked and even
[1:12:54] sat through the service
[1:12:56] but god put something on the inside of
[1:12:59] me
[1:13:00] that said i'm sorry devil i'm not giving
[1:13:03] them to you
[1:13:23] now for the phobias
[1:13:26] i don't have nothing at any of you
[1:13:28] you can't give cancer away
[1:13:30] i've tried to give it away over and over
[1:13:32] again
[1:13:39] the scripture mark chapter 16 this is
[1:13:41] jesus's
[1:13:43] some of his last words that's going to
[1:13:46] be disciples that are going to shake the
[1:13:49] the devil's kingdom
[1:13:53] and you have been built in laodicea
[1:13:56] with the greatest message this has ever
[1:13:58] been
[1:14:00] to shake satan's kingdom
[1:14:04] go ye into all the world and preach the
[1:14:06] gospel to every creature and he that
[1:14:09] believeth and then baptized
[1:14:12] shall be saved
[1:14:14] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:14:16] damned
[1:14:18] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:14:20] believe
[1:14:22] in my name shall they cast out devils
[1:14:24] and they shall speak with new tongues
[1:14:27] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:14:29] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:14:31] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:14:34] and they
[1:14:35] shall recover
[1:14:38] [Applause]
[1:14:46] we are asked to put on the whole armor
[1:14:49] because we are at war
[1:14:54] your greatest enemy is not your wife
[1:15:01] it's not your husband
[1:15:03] it's not your principal or your teacher
[1:15:06] at school
[1:15:08] it is not your mom and dad
[1:15:14] mark twain said my father
[1:15:17] said at 16 years old i thought my father
[1:15:20] was the stupidest man in the world when
[1:15:24] i turned 23 i found out my daddy was the
[1:15:26] smartest man in the world
[1:15:28] [Music]
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:36] your greatest enemy
[1:15:41] it's the one that you call the half
[1:15:51] battleground is in your mind
[1:15:55] because positive and negative thoughts
[1:15:58] converge
[1:16:01] and it's whichever words that you let
[1:16:03] slip out
[1:16:08] negative atmosphere
[1:16:10] atmosphere of fear
[1:16:12] atmosphere of doubt
[1:16:14] atmosphere that everybody's against me
[1:16:23] well i'm the only one in my my school
[1:16:26] that wears a dress
[1:16:28] hallelujah good
[1:16:31] god didn't have to put a thousand people
[1:16:33] around you to prop you up
[1:16:35] he had confidence in the seed that he
[1:16:37] put on the inside of you that
[1:16:40] you might be the only one in your family
[1:16:42] or in your work or in your school
[1:16:46] that he could have lived this word
[1:16:52] you're just looking at it wrong
[1:16:58] because on the other side of this veil
[1:17:00] they would have wished they'd have been
[1:17:03] [Applause]
[1:17:07] so who is the strongest
[1:17:16] well brother ron i don't have a tattoo
[1:17:23] i love mary
[1:17:26] but you married martha
[1:17:30] how'd that work out for you
[1:17:35] [Applause]
[1:17:51] i promise you i didn't know
[1:17:56] the quicker that you understand the
[1:17:58] battle
[1:18:02] that you've been sent here to war
[1:18:06] the quicker you'll get your lunchbox
[1:18:08] packed
[1:18:12] and you'll pull your sword and say we're
[1:18:14] ready
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:23] a lot of people want to shatter box the
[1:18:25] devil
[1:18:27] as long as they don't get hit whoo
[1:18:32] mike tyson
[1:18:34] forgive me here but mike tyson said
[1:18:36] everybody came into the ring with a plan
[1:18:40] but it once i hit him in the mouth the
[1:18:42] plan left
[1:18:45] [Applause]
[1:18:49] there's a lot of people sitting pews
[1:18:52] a lot a preacher stands in pulpits
[1:18:55] and as long as they haven't been in a
[1:18:57] battle everybody's got hallelujahs going
[1:19:00] on
[1:19:01] but you just stand toe-to-toe with the
[1:19:03] devil one time
[1:19:06] and fight him and feel his cold breath
[1:19:10] he's been at war a long time
[1:19:14] he is no paper tiger
[1:19:17] he would destroy you if he could
[1:19:23] i personally remind him over and over
[1:19:26] again you have proved devil
[1:19:28] in my own life you don't have enough
[1:19:35] [Music]
[1:19:43] a lot of people's only been in a good
[1:19:44] hugging match
[1:19:48] not a fight
[1:19:50] if you're ever in a fight with the devil
[1:19:52] you know it's
[1:20:04] warriors
[1:20:06] for the newcomers that are here
[1:20:09] welcome to war
[1:20:15] this ain't about how you vote
[1:20:21] i'm not trying to make you better
[1:20:23] citizens of the united states of america
[1:20:26] or of iran
[1:20:28] or iraq
[1:20:29] or of ireland or of russia
[1:20:34] because this world's not our home
[1:20:36] [Music]
[1:20:38] and we're from another kingdom
[1:20:41] we've just got to act like we're from
[1:20:43] another kingdom
[1:20:45] we gotta fight like we're from another
[1:20:47] kingdom
[1:20:48] [Applause]
[1:20:56] caesar
[1:20:57] was going to have somebody to ride in
[1:20:59] his carriage you've heard it a lot of
[1:21:01] times
[1:21:05] the great officers
[1:21:08] got their self ready polished
[1:21:11] their plumes they got all of their
[1:21:12] feathers just right
[1:21:16] and he went through and he saw a man
[1:21:17] there that had a lot of scars on him
[1:21:21] he said where'd you get your scars
[1:21:26] i got them fighting for you
[1:21:34] i want to take that just for a moment
[1:21:36] just remind you
[1:21:38] a lot of them soldiers they never put a
[1:21:40] sword against again another person
[1:21:46] you know a lot of times people that you
[1:21:48] look at and go wow they're a real
[1:21:49] soldier they ain't really been in a
[1:21:51] fight yet
[1:21:54] but when you see somebody with scars and
[1:21:56] they're still standing
[1:22:00] ain't that right brother fred when you
[1:22:02] see somebody with scars and they're
[1:22:04] still standing
[1:22:06] and they've been in a fight that's the
[1:22:08] guy that i want to pray for me
[1:22:13] it's not the god that says now i lay me
[1:22:15] down to sleep i pray to lord my soul to
[1:22:17] keep if i should die before i wake i
[1:22:19] pray to lord my soul to take
[1:22:23] it's that one that says thank you god
[1:22:25] that i made it through this day
[1:22:29] within my own self i didn't have the
[1:22:31] strength to get through it but you
[1:22:32] helped me
[1:22:34] god rest my body and when i put my feet
[1:22:36] on the floor tomorrow
[1:22:38] give me the strength to block the devil
[1:22:40] right in the eye
[1:22:42] [Applause]
[1:22:56] let's just think about this no weapon
[1:22:57] that has formed against me
[1:22:59] hurt feelings
[1:23:07] hurt feelings
[1:23:11] hurt attitudes
[1:23:18] bruised and battered
[1:23:22] i sent you a text this week
[1:23:28] i want that to be said about me that i
[1:23:30] you can't tell
[1:23:31] who's enemy and who's not
[1:23:40] folks let me just say this to you
[1:23:44] on this side of the veil
[1:23:49] i don't care who sits down beside of me
[1:23:52] i want to try to make that person a
[1:23:54] better person
[1:23:57] if they're the biggest devil in hell i
[1:23:59] want to get them converted
[1:24:04] well brother ron i can't stand that
[1:24:06] person because you need more love of god
[1:24:08] in your heart
[1:24:10] [Applause]
[1:24:24] if there's somebody you can't stand to
[1:24:26] be around why don't you do the opposite
[1:24:28] why don't you walk right up to them
[1:24:30] shake their hand and tell them you just
[1:24:32] don't know how much i love you
[1:24:35] if i tell you that later at the at the
[1:24:38] thing you just don't know how much
[1:24:57] you don't know what they said sticks and
[1:24:59] stones are brick
[1:25:01] but your words gonna never hurt me
[1:25:07] i resigned to myself a long time ago
[1:25:10] i'm better than losers
[1:25:13] this is my personal notes this visit's
[1:25:15] all right
[1:25:17] i resigned myself a long time ago i'm
[1:25:19] better than losers
[1:25:21] i'm better than quitters
[1:25:23] i'm better than backsliders
[1:25:32] sometimes we get an idea that
[1:25:34] backsliding is
[1:25:36] quitting church
[1:25:41] going to get a good drink
[1:25:45] i've been serving the lord really hard
[1:25:49] where was you last week well i've been
[1:25:51] serving the lord really hard
[1:25:53] i just decide to take the weekend off
[1:25:55] and get drunk
[1:26:04] backsliding is not that
[1:26:08] backsliding can be qualified as sitting
[1:26:10] in these pews
[1:26:14] and putting up a shell around yourself
[1:26:17] and folding your arms i'm not looking
[1:26:20] for your arms and saying well i hope
[1:26:23] that you guys catch up with me
[1:26:38] if your life only on fire for god you're
[1:26:39] backsliding
[1:26:42] if your prayer life if you're not
[1:26:43] breaking through your backsliding
[1:26:46] if you're not reading your bible and
[1:26:47] praying every day you'll backslide
[1:26:50] are you with me now
[1:26:57] we must remain focused
[1:27:03] focus with no fear
[1:27:07] refuse to be afraid
[1:27:11] satan stacks the odds against you
[1:27:14] you don't have to tell him how big he is
[1:27:17] he'll tell you how big he is
[1:27:20] it isn't david that's going out there
[1:27:22] and measuring the life
[1:27:28] measuring his his staff
[1:27:31] counting his brothers
[1:27:33] [Music]
[1:27:34] golots already told them how big he is
[1:27:38] you don't have to worry about your trial
[1:27:40] coming along and the mountains are so
[1:27:42] big
[1:27:58] can i just say this to you
[1:28:00] you will never find your eagle wings
[1:28:04] safely
[1:28:05] resting
[1:28:06] in your nest
[1:28:12] can i say it to you you will never find
[1:28:14] your eagle wings
[1:28:19] resting safely
[1:28:22] in your nest
[1:28:32] it's when you get dropped off of a cliff
[1:28:35] by mama
[1:28:37] and she shakes you off
[1:28:39] and you go
[1:28:44] you either find your wings or you find
[1:28:46] the bottom
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:48] [Applause]
[1:28:49] [Music]
[1:28:51] mommy dropped me that's exactly what she
[1:28:54] did flap your wings
[1:28:58] [Applause]
[1:29:12] sometimes brother david we just need to
[1:29:13] look over in there say move over i got
[1:29:15] to flap my wings here a little bit
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:20] i watched some of your last notches
[1:29:22] flapping your wings
[1:29:24] you've been through hell all week and
[1:29:26] you came into church to get your payday
[1:29:29] and you get started flapping your wings
[1:29:31] a little bit and you get a little air
[1:29:33] under your wings how before long you go
[1:29:52] to the people that are watching it's
[1:29:54] more than emotion
[1:29:57] those people are too pentecostal those
[1:30:00] people are too emotional i want you to
[1:30:02] understand
[1:30:03] we are only expressing our victory
[1:30:07] [Applause]
[1:30:20] [Laughter]
[1:30:25] oh
[1:30:26] dear lord this is way too much fun
[1:30:33] nobody knows what anybody else in this
[1:30:35] building has went through
[1:30:38] you think you know
[1:30:40] you really don't know
[1:30:44] but neither do you need to know
[1:30:49] brother ron no i haven't done nothing
[1:30:51] supernatural this week you sure did
[1:30:54] you showed back up
[1:31:04] all hell's been against you trying to
[1:31:06] stop you and you still show up
[1:31:12] he's told you to quit nobody loves just
[1:31:14] told you every different kind of thing
[1:31:15] in the world god don't love you god
[1:31:17] don't care and you still go to work
[1:31:20] you still have victory you still listen
[1:31:23] to your word you still listen to the
[1:31:25] tapes you still come to church you still
[1:31:28] amen you still shout you still
[1:31:50] now listen sometimes we need a support
[1:31:51] system around us
[1:31:55] and sometimes whether you know it or not
[1:31:57] you're a support system to somebody else
[1:31:59] and they're watching you
[1:32:01] they're drawing strength from you
[1:32:07] i don't draw strength from people that's
[1:32:08] all the time got negative attitudes
[1:32:12] matter of fact i don't pay them too much
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:21] i was told by
[1:32:23] an older general
[1:32:25] said three percent of the church causes
[1:32:27] you 97 of the problems
[1:32:30] if you can ever learn
[1:32:33] brother ron to pay no attention to the
[1:32:35] three percent
[1:32:36] it'll save you the 97 of the problems
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:43] it's one reason i don't counsel
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:49] my ears are not trash cans
[1:32:57] but i want to give you some
[1:32:58] encouragement here
[1:33:01] winning a war don't start in five
[1:33:03] minutes
[1:33:05] it took you a lifetime to get in the
[1:33:07] mess that you're in
[1:33:15] you married her
[1:33:17] you married him
[1:33:20] fall in love all over again
[1:33:29] he snores he don't brush his teeth
[1:33:38] he don't talk until 10 o'clock in the
[1:33:40] morning
[1:33:44] he's not a real leader of the home he's
[1:33:48] you know he don't lead us in prayer and
[1:33:50] he don't
[1:33:51] you know he don't have a meeting in the
[1:33:53] house and have prayer service
[1:33:56] probably he's not a preacher
[1:34:02] but he's a real man
[1:34:05] you can find where he prays
[1:34:08] you find where he reads his bible
[1:34:17] you see her at the
[1:34:19] at the sink
[1:34:21] and she's praying
[1:34:24] and shaking the kingdom of hell
[1:34:28] i'll tell you the strength of your home
[1:34:30] is prayer
[1:34:38] psalms 103 said bless the lord o my soul
[1:34:43] all that is within me bless his holy
[1:34:45] name
[1:34:47] bless the lord o my soul and forget not
