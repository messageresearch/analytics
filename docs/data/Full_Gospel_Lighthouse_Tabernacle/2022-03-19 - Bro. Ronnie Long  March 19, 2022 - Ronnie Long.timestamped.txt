[42:21] anoint your vessels father that have
[42:23] come to gather in your presence lord
[42:26] father we look for these things to
[42:29] to be manifested tonight as we pray for
[42:31] them in the name of the lord jesus
[42:32] christ
[42:34] amen and amen amen hallelujah thank you
[42:37] musicians and it's going to be in the
[42:39] house of the lord with you amen
[42:41] amen if maybe i hadn't got to shake all
[42:44] your hands we've been here a couple
[42:45] times but i'm just brother ronnie and
[42:48] it's just me amen
[42:49] good to have my wife and uh some of our
[42:51] kids with us and we're missing one but
[42:54] it's good to be here with you amen
[42:56] we bring greetings from our pastor
[42:58] brother ray
[42:59] he said make sure you you tell them
[43:01] people that they have
[43:02] a real good man at the helm
[43:06] so we just trust that
[43:08] trust that we could
[43:10] just
[43:11] just maybe speak something that would be
[43:12] a blessing to our hearts amen i know
[43:15] um i told brother andrew when he first
[43:17] asked me about i said you have big shoes
[43:19] to fill and he said but we know a big
[43:21] god
[43:22] and i believe that's the truth god bless
[43:23] you brother stephen good to see amen if
[43:25] you have your bibles if you turn to the
[43:26] book of luke the second chapter
[43:36] we're just going to read the 49th verse
[43:43] and he said unto them
[43:44] how is it that you sought me
[43:47] wish ye not that i must be about my
[43:50] father's business
[43:51] amen may you be seated tonight i just
[43:54] want to talk for a few moments on
[43:56] it's it's the father's business
[43:59] amen now now we can have a lot of things
[44:02] we can have a a a
[44:04] a business maybe in life and like me i
[44:06] got a business and and i know brother
[44:08] ron has a business and a lot of times we
[44:10] we purpose in our heart to to fulfill
[44:12] that business exactly
[44:14] as we set out sometimes you promise that
[44:16] a job is going to get done on monday and
[44:18] it snows on sunday and you just can't
[44:20] get there you know and it's just out of
[44:21] your control but you'd like to run a
[44:23] business uh just exactly like you
[44:26] promised it because your name is
[44:27] attached to that business right
[44:29] but god doesn't run a business like man
[44:31] runs a business
[44:33] when god ever puts his name attached to
[44:35] something he's going to back it up with
[44:37] everything that he's got and
[44:39] and and and no circumstances is going to
[44:41] get in front of what god's about to do
[44:44] so so if we have if we have god to back
[44:47] our business then i say uh what could
[44:49] stand in front of us now i know we know
[44:52] the scriptures and we know a a lot of a
[44:54] lot of encouraging quotes and a lot of
[44:57] encouraging thoughts and scriptures but
[44:59] when when that ever strikes our heart is
[45:01] a revelation that if god be for us then
[45:04] who can stand against us because you see
[45:07] my my god my my father is not just uh
[45:10] just barely making it through or or
[45:12] maybe just just squeaking on by but he's
[45:15] he's rich in mercy amen and he's
[45:17] exceedingly rich in grace uh
[45:20] brother brahm said that his his his
[45:21] mercies are inexhaustible
[45:24] i i would that if we have a need tonight
[45:26] whatever it might be
[45:27] there is a there is a fulfillment for
[45:29] that need in my father's house there
[45:32] there is already a place prepared for
[45:34] that need in my father's house and i
[45:36] believe if we could just tap into that
[45:38] for a moment to realize that that
[45:40] friends we're not sent here without a
[45:42] purpose and we're not sent here just to
[45:44] fill his seat and we didn't we didn't
[45:46] just come across this truth just so that
[45:48] we could almost make it but i believe
[45:50] god has a destination for each and every
[45:52] life i believe he has such a plan
[45:55] organized and orchestrated that you
[45:58] can't help but make it even though you
[46:00] would try to leave you couldn't help but
[46:02] make it because there's something on the
[46:04] inside of you that will see that you get
[46:06] to where you're going there's something
[46:08] greater working within us than we even
[46:10] know about ourselves
[46:12] i want maybe look at your neighbor
[46:13] tonight and say you're a king
[46:16] you're a king
[46:18] or spiritual king is that right
[46:21] now maybe this this this afternoon when
[46:23] you got ready to come to church and
[46:25] maybe you combed your hair a little bit
[46:27] you probably didn't look at yourself in
[46:29] the mirror and think i'm a king
[46:32] if you're like me you looked at yourself
[46:34] in the mirror and thought
[46:39] but there's something greater inside you
[46:42] there's a greater force inside you than
[46:44] even you recognize about yourself and i
[46:47] know i'm speaking to believers i know
[46:49] i'm speaking to overcomers in here i
[46:51] have absolute confidence that i'm
[46:53] speaking to a room full of warriors you
[46:55] might say well you don't know me and you
[46:57] can't say that about me but a church
[46:59] takes the spirit of his pastor and i
[47:01] know that i'm speaking to a room full of
[47:03] warriors in here tonight that know how
[47:05] to swing a sword that know how to fight
[47:07] a battle because you have the spirit of
[47:09] your leader so i know him well enough to
[47:11] know that he can swing his sword so i
[47:13] know who i'm talking to tonight i know
[47:16] that we're more than just just going
[47:17] through a layout to see an age in a dark
[47:19] hour but we will overcome every obstacle
[47:23] that the devil places in front of us why
[47:25] because we've been predestinated to do
[47:27] it
[47:28] every every every person in time every
[47:30] believer that there's ever been has
[47:32] looked to this one hour in time
[47:35] i know that it's words that are told to
[47:37] us time and time again but we are
[47:38] standing at the most important point
[47:41] that there ever has been in history
[47:43] every man of faith has looked forward to
[47:45] this moment since there ever was time
[47:48] since there ever was a beginning since
[47:49] there ever was a fall this is the
[47:51] fullness of all things
[47:53] and i know you looked at yourself in the
[47:55] mirror tonight and you didn't think that
[47:56] you were looking at a king
[47:58] you didn't think that you were looking
[47:59] at an overcomer but you are absolutely
[48:02] an overcomer you know why because how
[48:03] many times have you if you're like me
[48:06] how many times have you said i'm done
[48:09] i'm not going back to church
[48:11] i'm gonna give this thing up i'm just
[48:12] gonna i'm just gonna go move off
[48:14] somewhere listen to tapes now and then
[48:16] or maybe just you know just just get
[48:18] into worship everyone i'm done i'm not
[48:20] gonna go back but i just want you to pat
[48:22] yourself and let yourself know you're
[48:24] here tonight
[48:25] you showed up tonight
[48:27] there's something greater inside you
[48:29] than even your own will to overcome it
[48:32] there's something pulling on you that
[48:33] brought you here then even your your own
[48:36] anticipation to be here but god rich in
[48:39] mercy has brought you this far and i
[48:42] gotta say he didn't bring you this far
[48:43] just to leave you or forsake you on the
[48:45] side of the road but he brought you this
[48:47] far to finish the work
[48:49] to finish something which he started
[48:51] it's his business to come and finish
[48:54] what he started
[48:55] now when jesus was just 12 years old he
[48:58] was left there forgotten
[49:00] in jerusalem by his by his earthly
[49:02] caretakers and then they go out on a
[49:03] journey and and they're gone for uh i
[49:06] think a day and a half and they don't
[49:07] even realize that he's not with him and
[49:10] they begin to search a search for him
[49:11] and where where is he i think no doubt
[49:13] that's that's many churches in this hour
[49:15] is they're going on a journey and they
[49:17] don't even realize that god's not even
[49:19] with them
[49:20] but all of a sudden an alarm came in and
[49:22] they said where's jesus now you think
[49:24] that mary would would have absolute tabs
[49:27] on jesus
[49:28] right i mean she knew how he came she
[49:30] knew that the angel came to her and he
[49:32] said that which is conceived in you is
[49:34] of the holy ghost you think that she'd
[49:37] have her focus on him at all times
[49:40] but you see how the world can get us
[49:41] distracted with with with things and
[49:44] there they were at they were at the the
[49:46] the passover the feast of passover and
[49:48] they were delivering their sacrifices
[49:49] and they were they were making their
[49:51] deals and they were going to the temple
[49:52] and they were worshiping and they got so
[49:54] distracted by that that they forgot that
[49:56] they left jesus behind
[49:58] is there any 12 year olds in here today
[50:00] anybody that's 12 years old
[50:02] imagine being left in jerusalem by
[50:04] yourself
[50:06] just cold by yourself
[50:08] no place to sleep no place to go
[50:13] 12 year old boy
[50:14] but you see he had a greater purpose to
[50:16] fulfill
[50:17] he was about his father's business and
[50:20] there they found him it took him three
[50:21] days to come back and there they find
[50:23] him in the temple and he's preaching to
[50:25] those
[50:26] that should be preaching to him and he's
[50:28] asking him questions that they can't
[50:30] give answers to and he's saying well
[50:31] what about this scripture what about
[50:33] what this prophet prophesied and you see
[50:36] you see god has a way that's higher than
[50:37] any man's theology and and he was asking
[50:40] well what about this this approach that
[50:42] you're taking in uh what about how far
[50:44] can psychology take you in this
[50:46] direction and he's he's asking these
[50:48] questions and he's stumping them every
[50:50] time and just a boy at 12 years old and
[50:52] i did a little research i think it was
[50:54] caiaphas that just came into office as
[50:56] the high priest at that time and there
[50:58] you see a root of bitterness start
[50:59] against this 12 year old boy that he
[51:01] said one day i'm going to get you back
[51:03] for this one day i'm going to get you
[51:05] but see that that that that opposition
[51:07] had already begun
[51:09] the real word came in contact with the
[51:10] false prophet
[51:12] you see there there has to be prophets
[51:14] arise for there to be a false prophet
[51:16] and there would have to be a false
[51:18] teacher to arise for to fulfill that
[51:20] scripture but if there's a false teacher
[51:22] somewhere
[51:24] friends i i've grown up and i've been
[51:26] blessed to grow up in a message church
[51:28] and i sat on the front road and i knew
[51:31] exactly what to say amen exactly when to
[51:32] raise my hand exactly went to went to to
[51:35] seem like i was in the service but all
[51:37] the while i knew that i was missing
[51:39] something inside of me
[51:41] and you see during that time i might
[51:42] have said amen to a lot of things that i
[51:45] now that i look back i say that wasn't
[51:46] the truth that brother was trying to
[51:48] lead us astray but you see if there's a
[51:51] false
[51:52] then there's got to be a true
[51:54] and maybe when you grow up in church and
[51:56] you've been around churches and you've
[51:57] seen a lot of false things and a lot of
[51:59] hypocritical things and pastors that
[52:02] abuse their authority or maybe church
[52:04] members that don't keep their word if
[52:06] there's a false then there's got to be a
[52:08] true there's got to be a true believer
[52:11] there's got to be a true pastor
[52:12] somewhere there's got to be a true
[52:13] believer that'll stand on this word
[52:16] because if there's a counter there's got
[52:18] to be the true
[52:21] i believe i'm talking to some true
[52:22] believers tonight i believe i'm talking
[52:24] to people who have weathered the storms
[52:26] of life that you know the thing about it
[52:28] is we might be in different stages of
[52:30] our storm we you might not be at the
[52:32] same stage as i am and you i might not
[52:34] be at the same stage as you are but
[52:35] we're all going through a battle but the
[52:38] important thing to know is who's in the
[52:39] ship
[52:41] i know who's in my ship i got it settled
[52:43] some time ago i know who's who's guiding
[52:45] my ship so therefore the the waves can
[52:48] be as high as they want but i know who's
[52:50] on the ship behind me i know who's
[52:52] guiding my path i know where i'm headed
[52:54] because i've met him
[52:57] you know friends that's the most
[52:59] important thing we can do is just stop
[53:01] sometimes we just kind of stop in our
[53:02] life
[53:03] and say where's jesus
[53:06] we could be on a journey thinking that
[53:08] we're doing the lord's will thinking
[53:09] that we're going out and fulfilling uh
[53:12] his mission and then we all of a sudden
[53:14] realize he's not with us
[53:18] that's the most important cargo that we
[53:20] could ever carry
[53:21] that's the most important person we
[53:23] could ever entertain
[53:25] now this world would distract us with
[53:27] with with anything it can think of
[53:30] it'll throw whatever it can think of at
[53:32] us
[53:32] but a real believer knows
[53:34] i've been some time since i've seen
[53:36] jesus
[53:37] but maybe it's been some time since i've
[53:39] seen jesus but where'd he go where'd he
[53:42] go and where'd they find him they found
[53:44] him where the word was if you don't know
[53:46] where jesus is at you've got to get back
[53:48] to the word you've got to dig back into
[53:50] this this is the only source of life
[53:53] friends you didn't just come in contact
[53:55] with this message because you're just a
[53:57] a breathing body here on earth but
[53:59] you're an elected seat of god that
[54:02] brought you in contact with the very
[54:04] thing that will give you a rapture the
[54:06] very thing that will give you a new body
[54:09] i firmly believe in this scripture that
[54:11] there are some standing here
[54:14] now i know in our our mental world
[54:16] that's hard for us to grasp and we think
[54:18] how does that come together and how does
[54:19] that cosmic light come together and
[54:21] those those those bodies change but
[54:24] we're not dealing with these three
[54:25] dimensions
[54:27] god's word is not dealing with just
[54:28] three these three dimensions that we see
[54:30] around us what we what we can feel and
[54:32] taste and see but but there's a whole
[54:34] nether world that he deals in
[54:36] and if god said that there would be a
[54:39] people
[54:40] that would never taste of death that
[54:42] they would receive a word so pure so
[54:45] true that it would give them rapturing
[54:47] grace within their life then i believe
[54:50] it with all my heart there's a word here
[54:52] and it's already got rapturing faith
[54:54] within it the prophet said it's already
[54:56] laying within you
[54:58] now friends you looked in the mirror
[55:00] today
[55:01] you probably didn't see that rapturing
[55:02] faith
[55:04] you might have just crawled your way
[55:05] here
[55:06] but you're here
[55:09] you might have just scraped your way
[55:10] this far but you're here
[55:14] let me say that if god if god found you
[55:16] found you worthy to give you a test
[55:20] then he put within you what it's going
[55:21] to take to overcome that test
[55:23] he didn't give you a test so you could
[55:25] fail it
[55:27] i don't know about you but my god does
[55:29] business a little different he didn't
[55:30] show up to the job thinking that he was
[55:32] going to turn it down and walk away
[55:35] my god specializes in projects
[55:38] you know we're in the construction
[55:39] industry and sometimes we come up to
[55:40] look at a house and i see it falling
[55:42] down and maybe it's a little leaning too
[55:44] far and i say you know what that's
[55:46] that's not worth the fixing but not my
[55:48] god
[55:49] you see one day i was leaning over
[55:51] pretty bad and i had a lot of problems
[55:53] in my foundation but god rich in mercy
[55:56] thought so much of me that he came and
[55:59] he said i can fix this one i can fix
[56:02] this project
[56:05] there's nothing too hard for god you
[56:07] can't run too far for god's grace
[56:10] but he can fix it
[56:12] just a touch of the master's head and he
[56:14] knows right where to put it back in
[56:16] order
[56:18] friends
[56:18] a man can't come into a heart and rewire
[56:21] heartbreak
[56:22] you can't rewire depression
[56:25] you can't rewire a broken faith but just
[56:28] one moment with god just one moment with
[56:30] god and that entire circuitry can be
[56:33] rewired
[56:34] just a moment in his presence
[56:36] why because he's the creator the author
[56:39] of life
[56:41] but we've got to know whose presence
[56:43] we're in friends uh
[56:45] peter came came across this situation
[56:47] one time
[56:49] and i know it's a will taught church so
[56:50] it's gonna save me time on flipping
[56:52] through this
[56:53] and and he comes jesus says peter
[56:56] whom do men say that i am
[56:59] well some say
[57:01] that's your this some say you're some
[57:03] say your biels above
[57:05] some say you're just a man that had
[57:07] psychology some some say that you're a
[57:09] man that just did good guesswork and
[57:12] some say you just you just kind of
[57:13] guessed your way this far but
[57:15] jesus said okay
[57:17] but who do you say that i am
[57:20] the personal experience with christ
[57:23] peter whom do you say that i am and he
[57:26] said thou art the christ the son of the
[57:28] living god i would ask this church
[57:30] tonight what does this message mean to
[57:32] you
[57:33] well some say that it's the seven church
[57:35] age messages some say that there's
[57:37] rapturing faith within there but what do
[57:39] you say about this message do you know
[57:41] where you stand on this word i say that
[57:44] it is the christ the son of the living
[57:46] god
[57:48] and though the gates of hell shall come
[57:50] against it they will not prevail
[57:53] why because there's something greater
[57:55] inside that body than you can see in the
[57:58] mirror
[57:59] there's some a supernatural force inside
[58:01] this flesh that you can't see by just
[58:03] looking in the mirror brother stephen i
[58:04] can't just see it on you but i know it's
[58:07] there
[58:08] why because the prophet promised it'll
[58:10] be there
[58:15] rapturing grace he says how's it ever
[58:17] coming to the church don't worry it'll
[58:19] be there
[58:20] don't worry it'll be there hey the bombs
[58:22] are falling it looks like it could
[58:24] happen any minute don't worry church
[58:26] it'll be there
[58:28] it'll be there
[58:31] it may not feel like it but in that
[58:33] moment it'll be there we're not waiting
[58:36] to become uh kings and priests but we
[58:39] are now kings and priests we are now
[58:42] rulers of a spiritual kingdom we are now
[58:44] every every spirit is subject unto
[58:47] christ spirit
[58:49] now
[58:50] now this world this chaos that we live
[58:52] in and there's there's threats of
[58:54] of of nuclear war and there's there's
[58:56] threats of this and and not to mention
[58:59] on top of that we're living in the the
[59:00] darkest stage of laodicea that there's
[59:02] ever been and uh there's just psychotics
[59:04] on the street and you can't hardly go to
[59:07] to to the store without just
[59:12] can't hardly live you can't hardly
[59:14] breathe you can't hardly drive down the
[59:15] street why because it's an attack
[59:18] on every standard that god stands for
[59:22] well let me say to you tonight that you
[59:23] are the standard that god stands for
[59:26] when the enemy comes in like a flood god
[59:28] will raise up a standard against him i
[59:31] say here we are devil there are still
[59:33] some that believe this word with all
[59:35] their heart there are still some that
[59:37] believe this message will produce a
[59:39] rapture there are still some that have a
[59:42] faith inside of them that the world
[59:44] can't shake that the world can't
[59:47] reproduce there's something inside a
[59:49] real believer that's a greater light
[59:52] brother branham said it's a greater
[59:54] light than it was at the dawn of
[59:56] creation
[59:59] that spoke worlds into existence he says
[1:00:01] the light that you're living under is a
[1:00:03] greater light than that
[1:00:05] you think about what power came forth
[1:00:07] when god said let there be light
[1:00:11] i don't know what it was that took place
[1:00:13] but it was a boom
[1:00:15] and light began to produce
[1:00:17] and planets begin to spin and stars
[1:00:20] begin to hang and supernovas begin to
[1:00:22] blast off and and things begin to come
[1:00:25] into coming to life
[1:00:28] but the anointing that we are under
[1:00:30] is a greater light than even that
[1:00:32] anointing at the dawn of creation so i
[1:00:35] would ask this question again if god be
[1:00:37] with us
[1:00:38] then who can but stand against us if god
[1:00:41] is for us
[1:00:48] they told me just be at home
[1:00:52] all right then we'll go all the way
[1:00:56] praise the lord
[1:00:58] you know i think the greatest the
[1:01:00] greatest weapon that the enemy has
[1:01:02] is to try to get us to fear our position
[1:01:04] in the body
[1:01:06] you know he can he can he can he can
[1:01:08] shake the church and he can he can bring
[1:01:10] national disaster about and he can bring
[1:01:13] a political disaster about but all that
[1:01:16] won't shake us but when he begins to to
[1:01:18] make us question where we're at in the
[1:01:20] body
[1:01:21] that's when fear sets in
[1:01:23] how do i know
[1:01:24] that i've got it
[1:01:26] how do i know that if he should come if
[1:01:29] let me say this if there's a bomb gonna
[1:01:30] drop tomorrow god's gonna take a rapture
[1:01:33] that fast before that
[1:01:35] so before the morning there's going to
[1:01:37] be a rapture and how do i know that i'm
[1:01:39] going to make it brother bob said don't
[1:01:40] worry church it'll be there
[1:01:43] it'll be there
[1:01:44] can you imagine how many times you would
[1:01:46] have given up i don't even think i could
[1:01:48] count brother ron how many times i would
[1:01:49] have given up in myself if it was up to
[1:01:52] me
[1:01:52] but it's not up to me
[1:01:54] there's something greater inside me than
[1:01:57] even what i can what i can produce in my
[1:01:59] own life there's something greater a
[1:02:01] supernatural force that lays within me
[1:02:04] oh i've tried to sit on it i tried to
[1:02:06] lay it down i tried to say i'm never
[1:02:07] going back to church again
[1:02:09] here i am
[1:02:11] what is it something greater within you
[1:02:15] there's a value within you
[1:02:18] that god thought you were so worth it
[1:02:22] god thought you and your inabilities and
[1:02:24] your inconsistencies and and your your
[1:02:27] unbeliefs and your your straying and
[1:02:29] your wandering god thought so much about
[1:02:31] you that he would he would blow a body
[1:02:34] into it and he would step into that body
[1:02:37] and he would come and he would pay the
[1:02:38] ultimate price
[1:02:40] friends i can't pay that price for you
[1:02:42] brother graham says you'll try to pay
[1:02:43] that price but don't don't do it because
[1:02:45] you ain't got the money
[1:02:47] i don't care how big your bank account
[1:02:49] is i don't care how much credit you have
[1:02:52] you ain't got the money to pay that
[1:02:54] price
[1:02:55] but god thought so much of you
[1:02:59] us
[1:03:00] my goodness sometimes we feel like we're
[1:03:02] not worth the skin that we live in
[1:03:04] sometimes we just feel like we're just
[1:03:06] barely pushing through
[1:03:08] but what what we need is a change of
[1:03:10] perception
[1:03:12] what we need is to change our perception
[1:03:14] of whose side we're on now friends i
[1:03:16] believe the church for years and years
[1:03:17] have been defending we've been defending
[1:03:19] defending defending
[1:03:21] but i think it's time to change our
[1:03:22] perception of of what we're doing in
[1:03:24] this race of what we're what we're sent
[1:03:26] here for i believe we're a generation of
[1:03:29] serpent bruisers i believe we're a
[1:03:31] generation of snake stoppers i believe
[1:03:33] it's time to change under the offensive
[1:03:36] and start start powering down on the
[1:03:37] devil with that arm you've been given
[1:03:40] you know the arm will get weak if all it
[1:03:42] does is defend
[1:03:43] and you'll get weary and you'll get weak
[1:03:45] but i say it's time to change your
[1:03:47] perception
[1:03:48] and you know just that fast everything
[1:03:50] in your life can change
[1:03:52] i know what i'm talking about
[1:03:54] i've been there i know exactly what i'm
[1:03:56] talking about how you feel like the
[1:03:57] entire world is against you and it'll
[1:03:59] never work out for you and you're just
[1:04:01] going to wander through this life and
[1:04:03] just in a moment with god
[1:04:05] your whole perception changes and your
[1:04:07] eyes are open to a world that you've
[1:04:08] never seen before
[1:04:11] you remember casey in the bible
[1:04:13] you remember the the the
[1:04:15] the assyrians were coming against them
[1:04:18] those philistines were marching against
[1:04:20] them and it was just two men
[1:04:22] sitting on a porch
[1:04:24] you see how the dumb the devil is
[1:04:26] is that all right can i can i say that
[1:04:28] see how dumb the devil is
[1:04:31] he said he said uh
[1:04:34] i don't remember the exact numbers maybe
[1:04:35] a hundred thousand syrians marching
[1:04:37] against two men
[1:04:39] sitting on the porch
[1:04:42] one of them had full trust in the lord
[1:04:45] the other one had got distracted with
[1:04:47] the pressure of the age
[1:04:49] i got distracted with what was going on
[1:04:51] around and you could just imagine put
[1:04:52] yourself in gehaze's shoes and he wakes
[1:04:55] up in the morning and comes out on the
[1:04:56] porch and
[1:04:58] there's a there's a hundred thousand
[1:05:00] hundred thousand soldiers marching
[1:05:01] towards us you could just hear the clap
[1:05:04] of them marching
[1:05:06] and get hazy
[1:05:08] do you see that
[1:05:10] do you see do you see what's happening
[1:05:12] do you see that they're marching
[1:05:13] straight for us i i told you we
[1:05:16] shouldn't have done that i told you we
[1:05:17] shouldn't have come against the devil
[1:05:18] that hard
[1:05:19] i told you we shouldn't have preached
[1:05:20] that that that forcefully i i told you
[1:05:23] we shouldn't have prayed that off that
[1:05:24] lady
[1:05:25] i told you and you see that humanity
[1:05:27] begin to just kick in and he he's
[1:05:29] worried he's saying hey wake up look at
[1:05:31] that they're they're gonna kill us
[1:05:34] and elisha just
[1:05:39] not even look in their direction
[1:05:43] we see he'd already received a
[1:05:44] revelation of his destination
[1:05:49] no amount of soldiers could stop that
[1:05:51] see when god's given a word
[1:05:53] when god's already given a prophecy
[1:05:56] there's no devil in hell there's not a
[1:05:58] hundred thousand philistines there's not
[1:06:01] a hundred thousand demons there's not
[1:06:02] two hundred thousand thousand demons
[1:06:04] that can stop that from coming to pass
[1:06:06] and you see he already knew his place in
[1:06:08] that vision and he just he just paid no
[1:06:11] attention those syrians you know where
[1:06:12] he was looking where he was going to
[1:06:14] lead them to their destruction and you
[1:06:16] see they couldn't back up there's no
[1:06:17] retreat for the bride they couldn't back
[1:06:19] up they couldn't go to the left they
[1:06:21] couldn't go the right there was only one
[1:06:22] direction they could go and that was the
[1:06:24] direction elisha was looking at it was
[1:06:26] forward
[1:06:27] now is not the time to back up and
[1:06:29] retreat on what we believe now is not
[1:06:32] the time to back up on where you stood
[1:06:34] for all these years now is not the time
[1:06:36] to start questioning what is the truth
[1:06:39] and what is not now is the time to go
[1:06:41] forward in jesus christ
[1:06:44] the bride only has one direction it's
[1:06:47] forward in jesus christ
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:50] we've already been given a more sure
[1:06:52] word of prophecy
[1:06:54] friends he's not going to let us down at
[1:06:56] the finish line but we've been
[1:06:58] prophesied that we would overcome in
[1:07:00] this age
[1:07:02] no matter how many enemies are against
[1:07:03] us it don't matter the amount it don't
[1:07:06] matter the severity
[1:07:08] friends you might be 32 thousand dollars
[1:07:10] negative in your bank account it don't
[1:07:12] matter to god
[1:07:14] just like that
[1:07:18] your blood sugar might be in the 700s
[1:07:20] that don't matter to god just like that
[1:07:23] just one moment in his presence can
[1:07:25] change everything about your scenario
[1:07:28] just open your eyes to see now i want to
[1:07:30] notice here it was just a perception
[1:07:32] change for gehazi
[1:07:35] nothing changed right
[1:07:37] did god just send those angels there nah
[1:07:40] they'd been there the whole time
[1:07:42] wonder why elisha wasn't worried because
[1:07:44] he knew that they were there he didn't
[1:07:46] have to see him with his eyes but he
[1:07:48] knew god will not forsake us he will not
[1:07:52] leave us he will not forget about us
[1:07:54] here but he's already got a legion of
[1:07:56] angels on its way
[1:07:58] you see the determination when you
[1:08:00] recognize your position in the body
[1:08:02] it don't matter what the enemy brings
[1:08:04] against you it don't matter whether your
[1:08:06] brother leaves or your sister leaves or
[1:08:07] your daddy leaves it don't matter if the
[1:08:09] guy next to you leaves because your your
[1:08:11] focus is on fulfilling that prophecy
[1:08:15] you've already been given a word
[1:08:18] god
[1:08:19] would you open this poor boy's eyes
[1:08:23] all of a sudden in just a moment
[1:08:25] everything changed
[1:08:27] all of a sudden where there was no hope
[1:08:29] there was no way out everything changed
[1:08:31] in that moment
[1:08:33] hey
[1:08:35] do you see that
[1:08:37] do you see that
[1:08:39] do you see those chariots of fire do you
[1:08:42] do you see those angels on every hilltop
[1:08:44] do you see that is that gabriel is that
[1:08:46] is that an angel of god do you see
[1:08:49] what's going on here
[1:08:51] but nothing changed in this world but
[1:08:54] you see his eyes were open to another
[1:08:56] realm that was there the whole time and
[1:08:58] if we could just for a moment see into
[1:09:01] that world to know that there's more for
[1:09:04] us
[1:09:05] then there is against us
[1:09:07] friends you might feel like you're up
[1:09:08] against the wall there's nowhere for you
[1:09:10] to run there's nowhere for you to go and
[1:09:11] that's just the way that god
[1:09:13] orchestrated it
[1:09:16] so you could be up against it and the
[1:09:19] only thing you could do was put all your
[1:09:21] trust in him
[1:09:23] put all your trust in the one who will
[1:09:25] not leave you put all your trust in the
[1:09:26] one who will not forsake you
[1:09:29] and they that put their trust in their
[1:09:32] lord
[1:09:36] friends
[1:09:37] there's more for you
[1:09:39] than there is against you
[1:09:42] it's more than just a saying
[1:09:44] it's a reality
[1:09:46] but the man would say if we could just
[1:09:47] if we could just see the the unseen
[1:09:49] world every time we go to our car
[1:09:52] and every time we we approach our
[1:09:54] vehicle there's there's angels sent
[1:09:55] there just for you
[1:09:57] now those aren't powerless angels
[1:10:00] god in just saying those angels to just
[1:10:02] occupy a seat but they're angels of war
[1:10:05] they're angels of battle and i believe
[1:10:07] the lord is so mindful about where
[1:10:09] you're at that he's already set an angel
[1:10:12] there where you're not even there yet
[1:10:14] well you haven't even approached the
[1:10:15] problem yet and he's already got an
[1:10:17] angel there waiting to meet you when you
[1:10:19] get there
[1:10:20] he knows all about it friends there's no
[1:10:22] surprise to god
[1:10:24] but friends we're on the winning side
[1:10:26] we're not defeated i'm not up against
[1:10:28] the corner i'm not in the defense i'm on
[1:10:31] the offense
[1:10:32] i'm not i'm not defending something but
[1:10:34] i'm standing for something
[1:10:37] friends there's been an attack against
[1:10:38] this message
[1:10:42] and i can say with all my heart that if
[1:10:43] you'll stand for it it will stand for
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:52] it's more than just words but i've
[1:10:54] experienced it with my own life
[1:10:56] just some years ago i hope this is okay
[1:10:58] to share a testimony i won't use any
[1:11:00] names just some years ago i was at a
[1:11:02] meeting in africa a youth convention and
[1:11:05] and there we were about to start a
[1:11:06] meeting we were going to preach maybe
[1:11:08] six services and me and another brother
[1:11:10] went together who was who was actually
[1:11:11] one of my best friends and and and and
[1:11:14] he
[1:11:15] the night before the meeting
[1:11:17] he began to tell me how this message
[1:11:18] wasn't true
[1:11:21] and how there were there were so many
[1:11:23] questions and so many things and he
[1:11:24] didn't believe that that that he was the
[1:11:26] the seven church age messenger and we're
[1:11:28] about to go into a meeting and preach
[1:11:29] together
[1:11:31] my if i've ever seen a set up for the
[1:11:33] god for god to do something it was that
[1:11:36] right there
[1:11:37] and here we are coming into this meeting
[1:11:39] and i'm just praying lord how can we how
[1:11:41] can we overcome this how can we get
[1:11:43] through this
[1:11:44] how can this meeting turn out to be a
[1:11:45] blessing these people in africa don't
[1:11:47] deserve to be caught in the middle of
[1:11:48] this war
[1:11:51] but you can see the forces working and
[1:11:53] and the angles being preached and the
[1:11:55] direction being preached and and there
[1:11:57] it came it came i was supposed to just
[1:11:59] preach too and it ended up that i was
[1:12:00] going to preach the last service
[1:12:02] and i said god i know that you're up to
[1:12:04] something
[1:12:06] and on the way to that service the
[1:12:08] pastor tells me he says you know there
[1:12:10] was there's a sister here in the church
[1:12:12] that's a gifted sister and she had she
[1:12:15] had seven prophecies for this meeting
[1:12:18] and he said six of them have come to
[1:12:20] pass and he listed the six things that
[1:12:21] had come to pass and i said well what's
[1:12:23] the seventh he said there will be a
[1:12:25] prayer line tonight
[1:12:27] and and and the deaf and the the lame
[1:12:30] will be miraculously healed
[1:12:33] i'm preaching
[1:12:37] now friends
[1:12:39] there's nothing that special about me
[1:12:42] but i know him
[1:12:44] i know i know the one that can come in
[1:12:46] and liberate in the room
[1:12:50] and i began to preach about the
[1:12:52] offspring of a creator and what it is to
[1:12:54] be the offspring of a creator that that
[1:12:56] your daddy is the creator of all things
[1:12:59] and the lord began to move and i tell
[1:13:00] you the devil ward against it he shut
[1:13:02] the lights off in the building and i
[1:13:03] don't know if you've been to africa but
[1:13:05] there's there if you don't have sound
[1:13:06] you're just screaming out into the
[1:13:07] wilderness and we're just in a big tin
[1:13:09] shed there's maybe 300 kids in there
[1:13:11] we're just screaming away and i began to
[1:13:13] quote the scripture when god said let
[1:13:15] there be light and when i said it the
[1:13:18] lights turned on god's my witness the
[1:13:19] lights turned on in that building the
[1:13:21] generator kicked on and the sound came
[1:13:23] through just like that i said let's
[1:13:25] finish it now
[1:13:26] call it now
[1:13:28] and a young man came up in that prayer
[1:13:30] line and he was it was his first time
[1:13:32] ever being in one of our services he
[1:13:34] said i've heard of christianity but i'm
[1:13:35] no religion
[1:13:37] he said this is my first time coming
[1:13:39] into one of these
[1:13:40] and through an interpreter i think he
[1:13:41] was from kenya
[1:13:43] and and and the interpreter was telling
[1:13:45] me this and i said well what's your need
[1:13:47] brother he said well i've had epilepsy
[1:13:49] since i was four i think he was about
[1:13:50] 21.
[1:13:51] he said i've had epilepsy since i was
[1:13:53] four now if you're a preacher
[1:13:55] that word means something to you
[1:13:59] epilepsy it's no joke
[1:14:04] and his eye was rolling around in his
[1:14:06] head he'd had so many severe seizures
[1:14:08] and he had had so many troubles in his
[1:14:10] life and i looked right at this brother
[1:14:13] that had just told me that the message
[1:14:14] wasn't true and i said if what i've
[1:14:16] preached to you is the truth
[1:14:19] if what i preached to you is the truth
[1:14:22] and the law and you believe it with all
[1:14:24] your heart the lord will heal you will
[1:14:26] you receive that and he said i'll
[1:14:27] believe it with all my heart friends i
[1:14:30] wouldn't be telling you this story
[1:14:31] tonight if that eye didn't go straight
[1:14:33] right in front of me and that demon came
[1:14:35] up out of it and went out the building i
[1:14:37] saw it with my own eyes why because god
[1:14:39] will stand for you
[1:14:42] if you stand for this word god will
[1:14:45] stand for you
[1:14:46] why because his name is on it
[1:14:49] it's his business
[1:14:52] his name his reputation everything that
[1:14:55] god is is behind this word
[1:14:59] he'll stand for it friends he'll stand
[1:15:01] for it in the dark times he'll stand for
[1:15:03] it in the sad times when you're all
[1:15:05] alone and you don't feel like anybody's
[1:15:07] around he'll stand for you
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] friends it's more than just words on a
[1:15:14] page
[1:15:15] oh friends if it's not if it's not that
[1:15:17] then what are we doing here
[1:15:19] what is all this for why have we given
[1:15:21] up so much and is it just another good
[1:15:23] set of morals
[1:15:26] is it just another way to live life now
[1:15:28] the buddhists have got us all beat
[1:15:36] but when
[1:15:36] god i've said amen like i said to a lot
[1:15:39] of things
[1:15:42] but when god
[1:15:44] ever says amen to something
[1:15:47] it's nothing but the truth and i will
[1:15:50] not find anywhere else in this world
[1:15:53] where god ever came behind a man's words
[1:15:55] and said amen outside of this message i
[1:15:58] believe this message is god in our hour
[1:16:01] i believe it is christ in this life i am
[1:16:03] not ashamed to admit that this message
[1:16:05] is life to me i will not look anywhere
[1:16:08] else for my answer i will not look
[1:16:10] outside these realms for for an answer
[1:16:12] from some psychologist or some
[1:16:14] theologian but this message is life
[1:16:19] this message will produce a rapture this
[1:16:22] message will produce a body change
[1:16:28] it could start right here
[1:16:31] think about it brother ron just red
[1:16:32] hairs begin to come back in and maybe my
[1:16:34] hairs will begin to come back in
[1:16:37] right here right now
[1:16:39] there's a people standing here that
[1:16:42] shall never taste of death
[1:16:44] why because we're walking in prophecy
[1:16:46] we're walking in fulfillment of what god
[1:16:49] already said would take place
[1:16:52] there's more prophecies about you
[1:16:55] than there has been about anybody in
[1:16:57] times past
[1:16:59] yeah you
[1:17:01] yeah you who feels like you're weak in
[1:17:03] faith yeah you who don't even know how
[1:17:04] you ended up here yeah you who might
[1:17:06] have been dragged in here tonight
[1:17:08] there's more prophecies about you as an
[1:17:10] individual than there is about any other
[1:17:12] people before you
[1:17:16] there's entire books written about you
[1:17:21] jesus was here to fulfill his father's
[1:17:23] business
[1:17:24] it wasn't building cabinets
[1:17:26] it wasn't hanging crown molding
[1:17:28] wasn't building a pulpit
[1:17:30] he was building a kingdom
[1:17:34] go back on your own time and research
[1:17:36] how many times jesus references the
[1:17:38] kingdom
[1:17:40] he was here on a purpose
[1:17:42] to build a kingdom and where is the
[1:17:44] kingdom of god it's within you the
[1:17:46] church it's within you the bride now let
[1:17:48] me ask how he was building that kingdom
[1:17:54] absolutely
[1:17:55] absolutely it is impossible
[1:17:58] to see the kingdom of god
[1:18:00] lest she be born again
[1:18:02] is that not the words of jesus
[1:18:04] that's why that's the hardest thing for
[1:18:06] a man to do is get down and be born
[1:18:08] again
[1:18:09] to get down and get rid of everything
[1:18:11] that you think every ideology that you
[1:18:13] have
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:15] friends there's such an attack against
[1:18:17] the church in this hour to to get the
[1:18:18] holy ghost out of the pulpit now
[1:18:20] obviously you've witnessed me for about
[1:18:22] 25 minutes and i'm not ashamed to maybe
[1:18:25] be a little a little uh demonstrative
[1:18:28] a little excited you know why because
[1:18:30] this has done something for me
[1:18:33] this has changed something inside of me
[1:18:36] you know you're never going to change
[1:18:38] from the way the way you are
[1:18:40] if you praise him now you're going to
[1:18:42] praise him there
[1:18:43] if you don't praise him now
[1:18:46] you ain't going to praise him any better
[1:18:47] there
[1:18:48] if you if you think that sometime you're
[1:18:50] going to get to a point where you're
[1:18:51] just going to get to a place of worship
[1:18:53] while you're just waiting for that last
[1:18:55] mile of the road let me say this is the
[1:18:57] last mile of the road it's time to let
[1:19:00] it out it's time to let it go
[1:19:02] you don't want to get there and keep
[1:19:04] that old dry spirit you want to let it
[1:19:06] out now
[1:19:08] it's not going to be any different when
[1:19:10] we get over there
[1:19:12] exactly how you worship him is exactly
[1:19:14] how you're going to worship him there
[1:19:16] i tell you i want to be next to this
[1:19:17] brother because me and him can let it
[1:19:19] out hallelujah worthy is the lamb that
[1:19:22] was slain
[1:19:23] god is worthy of every praise we could
[1:19:25] ever give
[1:19:27] only a devil would try to quiet the
[1:19:29] praise of god's people
[1:19:31] is that okay
[1:19:33] only a devil would get into a pulpit and
[1:19:35] try to quiet the praise of god's people
[1:19:38] [Applause]
[1:19:41] you don't need to discern that spirit
[1:19:43] it's a devil
[1:19:45] we were sent here for one purpose to
[1:19:48] worship the lord our god
[1:19:59] i will die in my boots before i let some
[1:20:01] psychologists come in and interrupt this
[1:20:04] word
[1:20:05] come in and interrupt the way i worship
[1:20:07] my god in the way that's called heresy
[1:20:10] do i worship by god
[1:20:14] you've been ordained for it you've been
[1:20:16] called for it that little thing inside
[1:20:18] of you that just wakes up it was put
[1:20:20] there by god
[1:20:24] he loves it
[1:20:25] he loves it when it happens he loves it
[1:20:28] when his people begin to worship him
[1:20:30] oh yeah
[1:20:32] oh the devil can't stand it that's why
[1:20:34] he's attacking the church
[1:20:37] that's why he's trying to get the holy
[1:20:38] ghost power out of the pulpit because he
[1:20:40] knows it's the changer
[1:20:44] it's the life changer where he used to
[1:20:46] just be he don't care if you come in and
[1:20:48] sit sit in church like some bump on a
[1:20:50] log and
[1:20:51] hey
[1:20:52] well i preach
[1:20:54] he don't care about that they've been
[1:20:56] doing that for two thousand years
[1:20:58] he don't care about that but when one
[1:21:00] believer
[1:21:02] ever recognizes this message to be the
[1:21:05] truth he has come in contact with his
[1:21:08] theophany
[1:21:10] and brother branham said you know that
[1:21:11] charge you feel when you're in the
[1:21:12] meeting and you raise your hands and you
[1:21:15] feel a jolt come through your body he
[1:21:17] said you've made contact with your
[1:21:19] theophany
[1:21:25] brother alvin ain't no rock gonna steal
[1:21:27] my praise
[1:21:30] ain't no bird gonna steal my praise
[1:21:32] not while i'm alive and got breath in my
[1:21:34] lungs
[1:21:36] let everything that has breath praise ye
[1:21:39] the lord
[1:21:43] oh isn't he worthy of it
[1:21:45] hasn't he done so much for us in our
[1:21:47] life
[1:21:48] if he never did another thing for me
[1:21:52] oh glory
[1:21:54] all honor is due
[1:22:04] hey they started it
[1:22:08] i'm not mad at anybody but i'm going to
[1:22:10] kick the devil out of the pulpit
[1:22:13] [Applause]
[1:22:14] it's the only cure
[1:22:17] it's the only inoculation that will hold
[1:22:22] friends we all have one thing in common
[1:22:25] i don't care who you are i don't care
[1:22:27] where you came from i don't care who
[1:22:28] your mama and daddy were here on earth
[1:22:30] we were all born with an infection
[1:22:35] we were all born with a serpent nature
[1:22:38] and there's only one thing
[1:22:40] that can get rid of that old serpent
[1:22:42] nature
[1:22:42] now maybe we have i know we have some
[1:22:45] some some folks in here that probably
[1:22:46] acquainted with snakes i'm not very
[1:22:48] acquainted with snakes
[1:22:49] but have you ever have you ever looked
[1:22:50] at how they get anti-venom
[1:22:55] i didn't know
[1:22:57] so i just google searched it they get
[1:22:59] anti-venom i tell you i was driving down
[1:23:01] the road
[1:23:02] and then the lord just dropped a thought
[1:23:04] and said what about antivenom and i just
[1:23:08] i was driving i'm sorry
[1:23:10] i just
[1:23:12] and i about had a shout and fit in the
[1:23:14] car
[1:23:19] i knew that they used the venom to make
[1:23:21] antivenin but i didn't know how they got
[1:23:23] it you know how they get it is they take
[1:23:25] the venom of that snake and they inject
[1:23:27] it into an animal
[1:23:29] and that animal's blood will produce an
[1:23:31] antibody and that antibody will defeat
[1:23:34] that venom
[1:23:35] that antibody produced from that animal
[1:23:37] will will create so many blood cells and
[1:23:39] so many things together and it'll come
[1:23:41] out and it'll it'll actually have a
[1:23:42] defense against that venom
[1:23:44] now they'll inject a powerful snake into
[1:23:47] a big animal like a horse or something
[1:23:49] that that maybe won't die but but but
[1:23:51] then they they cut that horse and they
[1:23:53] bleed them out
[1:23:54] and those antibodies that come out of
[1:23:56] that blood is what you get when you get
[1:23:58] an antivenom now maybe this don't mean
[1:24:00] much to you but you see i was snake bit
[1:24:02] one time
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:05] i had a real bad snake coming by me one
[1:24:07] time brother ram said even that snake is
[1:24:09] death and if you don't get rid of it you
[1:24:11] won't be there
[1:24:13] that's why they're trying to push the
[1:24:14] holy ghost out of the church
[1:24:16] because one day i had a sacrifice come
[1:24:18] for me
[1:24:19] and he took that snake into himself and
[1:24:22] he took all the venom of that snake and
[1:24:24] then the roman soldier came and he cut
[1:24:26] his side and he began to bleed him out
[1:24:29] and out of that blood was the antibody
[1:24:32] by which men are saved
[1:24:36] we're not going to make it without the
[1:24:37] holy ghost
[1:24:40] we've got to have it we've got to have
[1:24:42] it day after day you know what it said
[1:24:44] it said for some serious snake bites it
[1:24:47] requires multiple doses
[1:24:51] [Music]
[1:24:52] hey i'll take a booster shot of this
[1:24:55] i'll take a booster shot of the holy
[1:24:57] ghost in power
[1:25:00] you want to feel young take a booster
[1:25:03] shot of this you want to feel that life
[1:25:05] come back into your heart take a booster
[1:25:07] shot of this
[1:25:10] it's the only inoculation that will hold
[1:25:12] you when the times come
[1:25:15] if you get that shot
[1:25:17] it'll be there
[1:25:20] that rapturing faith that you're worried
[1:25:22] about it'll be there
[1:25:24] it's the evidence
[1:25:26] it's the check
[1:25:27] it's got his name on it
[1:25:33] your whole life you've been waiting for
[1:25:34] that
[1:25:36] i just i'm a simple guy
[1:25:38] i'm sorry if i'm too simple but
[1:25:43] brother
[1:25:45] take this piece of paper
[1:25:48] where'd you get that
[1:25:50] i gave it to you
[1:25:52] now you
[1:25:53] could carry that piece of paper your
[1:25:54] whole life
[1:25:56] and never know where it goes
[1:25:58] never know why you wander
[1:26:00] never know why anything couldn't bring
[1:26:01] you any satisfaction never know why just
[1:26:03] the the temporary things couldn't bring
[1:26:05] that that real that real the
[1:26:07] satisfaction of hunger that you had
[1:26:10] because i got the other half
[1:26:13] now when you come in contact with that
[1:26:14] holy ghost
[1:26:16] this is the other half that house been
[1:26:18] waiting to come in contact and when it
[1:26:20] comes together it's a perfect match now
[1:26:22] what was once in part is now in whole
[1:26:25] now what's what we saw partly we can see
[1:26:27] totally why because it's been in us the
[1:26:30] whole time
[1:26:32] it's been right in you the whole time
[1:26:34] that's why the devils tried to stop that
[1:26:36] move from happening
[1:26:40] friends we've got to overcome to come in
[1:26:42] contact with their other half a paper
[1:26:44] that is the overcoming
[1:26:47] i can't even tell you how many times i
[1:26:48] thought i would give up
[1:26:50] but i'm still here
[1:26:52] why because something better was inside
[1:26:54] of me
[1:26:55] that i couldn't see
[1:27:03] the father doesn't do business
[1:27:06] like us earthly folk
[1:27:09] he doesn't just leave something until it
[1:27:10] needs attention
[1:27:12] and then work on it he doesn't pile
[1:27:14] something up in the shop and just let it
[1:27:16] store there
[1:27:19] but his every focus is on you
[1:27:25] god
[1:27:27] who's infinite in power
[1:27:29] his every focus
[1:27:31] is on you
[1:27:33] his every focus is on your situation
[1:27:38] friends it's more than just words
[1:27:40] it's life
[1:27:44] the position of this age is so dark
[1:27:47] there's so much pressure on on on on on
[1:27:50] everyone
[1:27:51] but we we if you've been here if this is
[1:27:53] your first time in a church you've sat
[1:27:55] here for a while you've heard too much
[1:27:58] just in this few minutes to walk out of
[1:28:00] here and not be responsible
[1:28:02] most of us have been sitting in here our
[1:28:04] whole life and we've heard way too much
[1:28:06] to walk out of here and not be
[1:28:08] responsible for what we've heard now let
[1:28:10] me ask you why god would take the time
[1:28:12] would go through the effort why he would
[1:28:14] cause a man to give his entire life to
[1:28:17] bring forth a word so that we could walk
[1:28:19] out of here and say well that was a good
[1:28:20] service
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:24] but god
[1:28:26] set this up
[1:28:28] he brought you here for a purpose
[1:28:30] he brought you here to receive him at
[1:28:32] the exact moment that he had set up
[1:28:35] before there ever was his time remember
[1:28:36] the woman at the well i have need to go
[1:28:38] by the way of samaria why did he have
[1:28:40] need to go by there because there was an
[1:28:42] elected seed that needed to bump into
[1:28:44] him along the way you know my god is
[1:28:46] really good at putting himself right in
[1:28:48] your way
[1:28:50] where you've got to come in contact with
[1:28:52] him
[1:28:53] and you may think well i'm just here my
[1:28:55] own accord
[1:29:01] he hath made us
[1:29:03] oh there are certain truths we need to
[1:29:04] emphasize and this is one of them he
[1:29:07] hath made us
[1:29:09] salvation is his doing salvation is of
[1:29:11] the lord all of grace he redeemed us for
[1:29:14] a purpose
[1:29:15] he bought us for a purpose
[1:29:18] we are kings spiritual kings oh we are
[1:29:21] going to be kings upon the earth with
[1:29:22] him as he sits on the throne but now we
[1:29:25] are spiritual kings and we reign over a
[1:29:29] spiritual kingdom
[1:29:32] that's a word prophet
[1:29:34] those are words to live by
[1:29:36] we reign now over a spiritual kingdom
[1:29:40] i was listening today to a message and
[1:29:42] brother braham said if we can only
[1:29:43] realize that we're believers
[1:29:46] and that phrase really struck me if we
[1:29:47] could only realize that we're believers
[1:29:51] hey this is my this is my rights
[1:29:54] this is my authority
[1:29:56] remember brother bannon would tell the
[1:29:57] story about that slave boy who came
[1:30:00] they said hey why is he so much better
[1:30:02] than the rest of the slaves
[1:30:03] why he's so much taller he's stronger
[1:30:05] he's
[1:30:06] he he does exactly what you tell him do
[1:30:08] you make him sleep somewhere different
[1:30:10] no
[1:30:11] do you feed him different no
[1:30:14] what's different about him whoa where he
[1:30:16] comes from
[1:30:18] his father
[1:30:19] is a king
[1:30:24] friends we got we got we got a brother
[1:30:26] in our church who's uh
[1:30:27] who who came over from england
[1:30:29] precious brother
[1:30:31] and he decided here last year that he
[1:30:33] was going to become a united states
[1:30:34] citizen he'd been here for years he was
[1:30:36] going to become a u.s citizen and so we
[1:30:37] went to his party of being a u.s citizen
[1:30:40] and i asked him i said well so what's it
[1:30:41] like
[1:30:43] to be a u.s citizen he said well it's
[1:30:46] not that much different except for i'm
[1:30:49] entitled to everything that you're
[1:30:50] entitled to
[1:30:53] and when i go home
[1:30:55] i'm an alien in my own country
[1:30:59] i just got a big smile on my face
[1:31:02] so you just became a citizen but you're
[1:31:04] entitled to every right that i've had my
[1:31:06] entire life
[1:31:07] yeah
[1:31:09] i thought my
[1:31:10] what a victory for our young people
[1:31:13] if you take on this new citizenship
[1:31:15] you're given every redemptive right that
[1:31:18] that men for thousands of years have
[1:31:20] strived for and you might just come in
[1:31:22] tonight for the first time and this
[1:31:24] thing might end tomorrow but you're
[1:31:25] entitled to every right that is in that
[1:31:28] kingdom
[1:31:29] and let me say this is not just some
[1:31:31] kingdom over in africa where my father
[1:31:34] is king
[1:31:35] this is another kingdom in another world
[1:31:38] where you have a new green card a new
[1:31:40] citizenship where you've taken that
[1:31:42] inoculation
[1:31:44] and you're entitled to every right
[1:31:46] that's in that kingdom
[1:31:48] hey that over there my daddy owns it
[1:31:50] salvation my daddy owns it healing in my
[1:31:53] body my daddy owns it
[1:31:56] holy ghost my daddy owns it
[1:32:00] that prodigal son my daddy owns it
[1:32:03] that depression my daddy owns it
[1:32:06] you see you're entitled to every right
[1:32:09] that's in that kingdom
[1:32:10] that's why we don't feel at home in this
[1:32:12] world anymore we go to walmart brother
[1:32:14] stephen and i feel like i'm i'm at war
[1:32:17] why because you're not of this kingdom
[1:32:20] you've taken a transfer
[1:32:21] there's been another passport given to
[1:32:23] you
[1:32:26] daddy
[1:32:28] is it gonna be there
[1:32:29] i checked the door twice son
[1:32:32] it's there
[1:32:33] will it be there when the death angel
[1:32:35] comes it'll be there when the death
[1:32:37] angel comes will it be there when when
[1:32:39] i'm down by myself and that depression
[1:32:41] and anxiety comes on me it'll be there
[1:32:43] when that demon comes to torment it'll
[1:32:45] be there oh will it be there when the
[1:32:47] palms begin to fall oh it'll be there
[1:32:50] it'll be there church you just watch and
[1:32:52] see you can call me a fanatic you can
[1:32:55] call me a man worshiper
[1:32:58] you can call me a a zealot you can call
[1:33:01] me a religious freak you can call me
[1:33:03] whatever you want but one of these
[1:33:05] mornings
[1:33:07] one of these mornings you're gonna call
[1:33:09] this boy god
[1:33:11] that's what we're here to do
[1:33:13] that's the commission we've been given
[1:33:16] to fulfill the word
[1:33:18] we are not defeated we've been seen in a
[1:33:21] vision of victory and i saw her and she
[1:33:25] was walking in a line and she was not
[1:33:27] divided she was singing onward christian
[1:33:31] soldier not backup not retreat onward
[1:33:35] christian soldier
[1:33:37] marching ass to war with the word of
[1:33:39] jesus going on before
[1:33:44] like a mighty army
[1:33:46] all one body we
[1:33:50] we're not divided
[1:33:52] we're walking in the fulfillment of
[1:33:54] prophecy
[1:33:55] i believe with all my heart that when
[1:33:57] brother branham saw that prophecy he saw
[1:33:59] this group of people standing here and
[1:34:01] others like you across this world and we
[1:34:04] were marching in one unison to one beat
[1:34:07] to one song and what was it this word
[1:34:12] we've been called for a greater purpose
[1:34:14] than any man that ever come before us
[1:34:18] that's what happened with enoch
[1:34:22] he walked so close to god
[1:34:24] the devil didn't know what to do with
[1:34:25] him
[1:34:28] i can't stop him
[1:34:29] he's got such a relationship
[1:34:31] you know what makes the difference
[1:34:32] between you
[1:34:34] and every other nominal church member
[1:34:36] out there
[1:34:38] you're not believing this to dodge hell
[1:34:43] you're not believing this because you're
[1:34:44] scared of a lake of fire
[1:34:46] you're not believing this because you're
[1:34:48] scared of the of the the battle of
[1:34:50] armageddon
[1:34:52] you're believing this because you met
[1:34:53] somebody
[1:34:56] you're believing this because somebody
[1:34:58] special came into your life one day
[1:35:01] and there was a love a connection that
[1:35:02] happened between you and him there was
[1:35:05] something that happened between you and
[1:35:06] him that you knew that you knew there
[1:35:08] was something lasting there
[1:35:11] i'm so glad that i could serve god
[1:35:13] because i love him with all my heart not
[1:35:15] out of fear not out of fear of judgment
[1:35:18] or fear of condemnation but i love the
[1:35:20] lord with all my heart and with all that
[1:35:23] is within me
[1:35:25] that's our one commandment
[1:35:26] to love the lord
[1:35:28] why because he came for us
[1:35:32] friends you're already spoken for
[1:35:36] the devil can't have you
[1:35:38] devil can't have you brother ron you've
[1:35:40] already been spoken for you've already
[1:35:42] been spoken for by the lord
[1:35:48] you know what you're already under
[1:35:49] ownership of another kingdom
[1:35:52] he's got no rights within this kingdom
[1:35:54] he doesn't have a green card to travel
[1:35:55] this kingdom he's not got free tourism
[1:35:58] visa in this kingdom i say it's time to
[1:36:00] change the narrative and get the devil
[1:36:02] out of our kingdom say devil you have no
[1:36:04] rights in my household you have no
[1:36:06] rights tormenting my children or my
[1:36:08] family you have no rights getting in
[1:36:10] between my marriage and my relationship
[1:36:12] you have no rights getting between me
[1:36:14] and the lord
[1:36:17] friends there's got to be a there's got
[1:36:19] to be somebody fulfill this
[1:36:22] i believe it's us
[1:36:25] i can't put your name there but i
[1:36:26] believe with all my heart it's us
[1:36:28] i say you gotta raise your hand for
[1:36:30] yourself i believe with all my heart
[1:36:32] it's me if there's just one gonna make
[1:36:34] it it's gonna be me
[1:36:36] if there's just one gonna see the lord's
[1:36:38] christ it's gonna be me
[1:36:42] why because there's something within you
[1:36:44] that's pulsating that out of you
[1:36:46] you didn't put that there
[1:36:48] you would have given up friends
[1:36:50] if it was up to our mortal ability
[1:36:54] we'd have given up
[1:36:57] that's why i'm confident
[1:36:59] of this very thing
[1:37:01] if god is for me
[1:37:05] let me tell you friends
[1:37:07] i've had to see him
[1:37:09] i've had to know that he's for me
[1:37:13] i've had to know you can i just i'm not
[1:37:15] going to go too much longer but i can
[1:37:16] share personal testimony
[1:37:19] there was a time i was at a crossroads
[1:37:22] i really needed a word from the lord
[1:37:24] anybody ever been there
[1:37:26] wondering what decisions you made and
[1:37:28] what direction you took
[1:37:30] i i really needed to know
[1:37:32] that the lord was was watching over me
[1:37:36] i'll never forget that time
[1:37:39] i got desperate for the lord
[1:37:41] and i i i believed i had met him i
[1:37:43] believed i had the holy ghost but i just
[1:37:45] needed an answer about what i was doing
[1:37:46] in my life and and and and
[1:37:50] i actually had just gotten back from a
[1:37:52] trip from the philippines and believe it
[1:37:53] or not preachers got issues too
[1:37:57] we have to pray up too
[1:37:58] and i got back from this trip and i just
[1:38:00] the trip was successful and the lord
[1:38:02] came and met us there but just inside i
[1:38:03] had this burden
[1:38:06] i had this burden on me and i just
[1:38:07] couldn't shake it i i just i just wanted
[1:38:09] to be free from it
[1:38:11] and i began to pray and i got down one
[1:38:13] night i remember i prayed all night till
[1:38:15] about four in the morning and just
[1:38:16] waiting lord there's that you promised
[1:38:18] there would be something supernatural
[1:38:19] take place
[1:38:22] nothing just just quiet
[1:38:24] just you could hear a pin drop
[1:38:27] i went up got ready for work
[1:38:31] well that weekend we were going to have
[1:38:33] some special meetings at church
[1:38:36] friday came
[1:38:38] powerful service
[1:38:40] saturday came
[1:38:42] even more powerful service
[1:38:44] sunday morning came
[1:38:46] and i'm thinking lord i've got to have
[1:38:48] something
[1:38:50] and the lord used our brother ron
[1:38:51] spencer
[1:38:54] and he was talking about abraham
[1:38:56] and he was talking about how there were
[1:38:57] many times that abraham would have given
[1:38:59] up
[1:39:00] if it not been for the lord keeping him
[1:39:03] there were many times that abraham would
[1:39:05] have just just the prophecy of isaac
[1:39:07] coming to pass
[1:39:09] there are many times he would have just
[1:39:10] given up on him but the lord was keeping
[1:39:13] him
[1:39:14] in that service he began to the lord
[1:39:16] began to just discern my heart
[1:39:18] let me tell you friends i was trying to
[1:39:19] sit on my hands as best i could
[1:39:23] but there's something there's something
[1:39:24] in you that you can't sit on
[1:39:28] they began to pull pull it out of me
[1:39:31] and the lord spoke directly to my heart
[1:39:34] actually called me up spoke directly to
[1:39:37] my heart
[1:39:39] i actually held my hand right here and
[1:39:40] spoke directly to my heart i i don't
[1:39:43] know if i ever told you this part of the
[1:39:44] story but but there you had grabbed my
[1:39:47] arm about right here
[1:39:49] and for about three weeks after that i
[1:39:50] felt the impression of a hand right here
[1:39:54] i believe with all my heart the angel
[1:39:56] was standing there
[1:39:57] i believe with all my heart because no
[1:39:59] man would know that have we ever never
[1:40:01] had longer than a 10 minute conversation
[1:40:04] no man would know
[1:40:06] that but you know what was preached
[1:40:09] before that in that meeting in that same
[1:40:10] service
[1:40:11] you read a quote and you said cancer
[1:40:14] might have you in a corner but he's
[1:40:15] already made a way of escape
[1:40:18] he said depression might have you in a
[1:40:19] corner but he's already made a way of
[1:40:21] escape you might be up against a wall in
[1:40:23] a bad battle in your life but he's
[1:40:25] already made a way of escape i can stand
[1:40:27] here and testify that if you stand for
[1:40:30] the word he will stand for you
[1:40:38] now it's not just me one time the
[1:40:40] prophet the prophet had a burden on his
[1:40:42] life you remember he couldn't shake the
[1:40:45] burden he couldn't get rid of the burden
[1:40:46] it was a burden to serve the people
[1:40:48] people were getting filled with the holy
[1:40:49] ghost people were getting healed people
[1:40:51] were things were taking place but he
[1:40:53] couldn't shake this burden
[1:40:54] and he walked with it for years
[1:40:56] but there one day
[1:40:58] something as simple as not shooting a
[1:41:00] deer
[1:41:03] you remembered your promise
[1:41:06] now i'll remember mine
[1:41:12] friends how many promises have you made
[1:41:14] the lord
[1:41:16] you remember your promise
[1:41:19] now i'll remember mine
[1:41:22] i can witness it
[1:41:23] i can testify with all my heart if you
[1:41:26] stand for this word
[1:41:29] the gates of hell
[1:41:30] cannot prevail against it
[1:41:33] they're going to try but they cannot
[1:41:35] prevail against it
[1:41:39] flesh and blood had not revealed this to
[1:41:40] you simon barjona but my father which is
[1:41:43] in heaven hath revealed this unto you
[1:41:46] and i say
[1:41:47] that thou art peter
[1:41:49] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:41:52] church
[1:41:53] and the gates of hell
[1:41:54] shall not prevail against it now your
[1:41:57] name might have been simon barjona in
[1:41:58] another verse you might have been just
[1:42:00] some church member in another verse but
[1:42:01] it got a lot more personal when he said
[1:42:03] he's gonna build his church upon this
[1:42:05] rock and he said i say unto you that
[1:42:07] thou art my bride and upon this rock i
[1:42:11] will build my church and the gates of
[1:42:13] hell shall not prevail against it though
[1:42:16] they try with everything they've got
[1:42:18] they shall not prevail against the
[1:42:19] people that know where they stand
[1:42:23] they that know their god shall perform
[1:42:26] exploits i believe that's speaking about
[1:42:28] us in this age i believe he prophesied
[1:42:30] there would be a people that would do a
[1:42:32] greater work
[1:42:33] and i give unto you the keys of the
[1:42:36] kingdom of heaven
[1:42:39] you got the key friend
[1:42:42] peter then went and backslid a couple a
[1:42:44] couple verses later gets rebuked by
[1:42:47] jesus but he says worry not peter for i
[1:42:50] prayed for you and at that time you'll
[1:42:52] know how to use the key brother brown
[1:42:55] said on that pentecost morning peter put
[1:42:57] the key in the lock and that arm of fake
[1:43:00] turned the key and he said this
[1:43:02] is that which the prophet joel has
[1:43:05] spoken of to come in this day
[1:43:07] i believe this is that which william
[1:43:10] branham spoke of to come in this hour
[1:43:12] that there would be a bride's revival
[1:43:14] strike the earth
[1:43:16] i believe if you want to find the elkton
[1:43:18] revival
[1:43:19] you're looking at it
[1:43:22] you're going gonna find some policemen
[1:43:24] someday say hey where's the welsh
[1:43:25] revival you're looking at it this is the
[1:43:28] bride's revival and the move is on for
[1:43:31] the bride these aren't just sayings or
[1:43:33] catchphrases
[1:43:35] this is what i believe
[1:43:39] it's us friends he was looking at us
[1:43:42] walking in line with the word
[1:43:44] yes and our faults yes and our failures
[1:43:48] but it was all ordained by god let me
[1:43:51] say that he didn't put you through a
[1:43:52] test that you didn't need
[1:43:55] let me say that god wasn't wasting this
[1:43:57] time when he drug you through the fire
[1:43:59] but he said buy of me gold
[1:44:02] tried in the fire heroes aren't born
[1:44:05] they're forged
[1:44:07] i'm talking to a church of heroes
[1:44:10] people that can stand in faith and say
[1:44:12] no matter if he slay me
[1:44:14] i'll trust him anyway
[1:44:18] no matter what may come i'll trust him
[1:44:20] anyway why because you've been forged in
[1:44:23] a fire you were gold all the time
[1:44:26] but it took that fire to bring the
[1:44:28] brightness out to you
[1:44:29] friends
[1:44:30] if our music players could come
[1:44:33] there's something about you
[1:44:35] that the world can't even see
[1:44:38] they're trying to figure out the value
[1:44:40] of you
[1:44:41] and what makes you valuable
[1:44:43] they'll never see it
[1:44:48] it takes a change of perception to see
[1:44:49] it about yourself
[1:44:52] we're not losing this battle
[1:44:55] i'm not retreating
[1:44:56] i i don't know i'm like that little guy
[1:44:58] who's blowing the trumpet he didn't know
[1:45:00] that he didn't even know how to tune the
[1:45:01] general told him he said see sound the
[1:45:03] retreat we're losing the battle he said
[1:45:05] i i he sounded the only retreat he knew
[1:45:07] which was
[1:45:08] move forward
[1:45:09] charge we're weary yet pursue we want to
[1:45:12] give up but we can't there's something
[1:45:14] greater within us we've got to charge
[1:45:16] the enemy
[1:45:18] we've got to move
[1:45:19] he said i never learned the bugle to
[1:45:21] retreat
[1:45:22] well i gotta say i never learn retreat
[1:45:24] either why would i waste my time with
[1:45:27] something i'm never gonna fulfill i am
[1:45:29] going to fulfill a body change
[1:45:31] i'm going to fulfill a rapture i'm going
[1:45:34] to fulfill one of these mornings
[1:45:37] i don't know what sensation is going to
[1:45:38] be like brother brown said it'd be like
[1:45:40] when you just worship the lord
[1:45:42] and you feel that just august presence
[1:45:43] come in and you feel the presence of the
[1:45:45] lord begin to sweep down upon you
[1:45:49] he said it will be just like that
[1:45:52] maybe you'll take a step a little higher
[1:45:55] but all of those trials led to that
[1:45:57] moment
[1:46:00] heroes are forged
[1:46:05] i think about a
[1:46:08] a fine brother
[1:46:09] who went through many battles
[1:46:11] questioning maybe where he was directed
[1:46:13] but you see he met him
[1:46:15] he met the lord
[1:46:17] and there him and silas are praying for
[1:46:18] a girl and they pray this demon spirit
[1:46:20] off of her and they throw them in jail
[1:46:23] hey it may happen to us
[1:46:26] paul wasn't discouraged by that
[1:46:29] he said
[1:46:30] they might kill me tomorrow
[1:46:33] it would be my honor
[1:46:34] to die for this gospel
[1:46:37] and they threw him in the jail that
[1:46:38] wasn't the end of story for paul but you
[1:46:40] see that trial was ordained of the lord
[1:46:45] i can just imagine a one guy jailed up
[1:46:47] in there
[1:46:49] he says hey what are you in for
[1:46:52] i murdered this guy yesterday
[1:46:54] yeah it's awful what are you in here for
[1:46:56] i didn't pay my taxes
[1:46:58] what are you in here for i stole a
[1:47:00] chariot
[1:47:01] what are you in here for you you two
[1:47:03] guys don't look like you belong in here
[1:47:06] oh well we prayed for a girl
[1:47:08] and the spirit came up out of her
[1:47:10] and she was delivered in that very
[1:47:12] instant
[1:47:13] and that's why we're here
[1:47:16] he said you you for real
[1:47:18] oh yeah
[1:47:20] i'm for real
[1:47:21] and you see where maybe not one believer
[1:47:23] was ever in that room before paul and
[1:47:25] silas entered that room
[1:47:27] and the atmosphere began to change
[1:47:28] around them
[1:47:30] began to say well by what authority did
[1:47:32] you pray that spirit off of that girl by
[1:47:35] the only authority there is
[1:47:37] by the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:47:40] and when we prayed in the name of the
[1:47:41] lord jesus christ that spirit came up
[1:47:43] out of her and she was delivered and
[1:47:44] she's walking free today and they put
[1:47:46] you in jail for that
[1:47:49] so it is
[1:47:51] and they're wondering well what are you
[1:47:52] what are you going to do are you
[1:47:52] discouraged no i'm not discouraged
[1:47:57] tell us about why is this the most
[1:47:58] powerful name that there ever was i
[1:48:01] could just imagine paul just fade into
[1:48:02] tears
[1:48:04] if you didn't own me
[1:48:08] you see i used to be saul
[1:48:12] and one day i met him
[1:48:15] one day he he knocked me off my high
[1:48:17] horse
[1:48:19] tell him about it silas
[1:48:21] silas tell them about that upper room
[1:48:24] silas oh my goodness
[1:48:26] we were all in one accord
[1:48:29] gathered in the upper room
[1:48:30] and that pillar of fire came over the
[1:48:32] building and there was one pillar of
[1:48:34] fire all these years over israel but in
[1:48:37] that moment it divided itself up into
[1:48:39] 120 vessels in that room and every lick
[1:48:42] of fire began to fall on every one in
[1:48:44] that building and i received a new birth
[1:48:46] in that moment
[1:48:48] tell them silas i've never been the same
[1:48:51] ever since that moment i've never been
[1:48:53] the same since that hour oh my whole
[1:48:55] life has been rearranged why because he
[1:48:58] put himself into me
[1:49:01] how'd it happen for you paul i was
[1:49:03] riding on my horse
[1:49:06] when a light greater than any light i've
[1:49:08] ever seen struck me blind
[1:49:13] and then what happened
[1:49:15] oh
[1:49:16] oh
[1:49:18] oh just imagine paul
[1:49:20] just thinking back on
[1:49:22] what the lord's done for him
[1:49:25] what it'll be like when we get there
[1:49:26] friends
[1:49:30] i just think of paul
[1:49:34] amazing grace
[1:49:36] how sweet the sound
[1:49:40] that saved a wretch
[1:49:44] like me
[1:49:48] i once
[1:49:50] was lost
[1:49:52] but now
[1:49:54] i found
[1:49:56] i was blind
[1:49:59] but now
[1:50:01] i see
[1:50:05] my chains are gone
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:22] me
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:30] his mercy reigns
