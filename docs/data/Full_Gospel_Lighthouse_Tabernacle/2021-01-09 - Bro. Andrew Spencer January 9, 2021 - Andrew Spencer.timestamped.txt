[47:52] for for our social standing we came out
[47:54] here to be
[47:55] in the presence of jehovah and i don't
[47:58] believe that jehovah
[47:59] is going to leave here depressed on how
[48:02] his children look on him but i believe
[48:05] jehovah will leave this place knowing
[48:07] that his children are in the place that
[48:10] he has positioned them to be
[48:12] father if you're not going to leave here

[49:17] and moses said unto the people fear ye
[49:20] not
[49:20] stand still and see the salvation of the
[49:22] lord which he will show to you
[49:25] today for the egyptians whom you have
[49:28] seen
[49:28] today you shall see them again no more
[49:31] forever
[49:32] what powerful reading that the
[49:36] enemy that you see today you shall see
[49:39] them again no more forever
[49:41] the lord shall fight for you and you
[49:43] shall hold your peace
[49:46] and the lord said unto moses wherefore
[49:48] christ thou unto me speak unto the
[49:50] children of israel that they go forward
[49:52] but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out
[49:55] thy hand over the sea and divide divided
[49:57] and the children of israel shall go
[49:58] up on dry ground through the midst of
[50:01] the sea
[50:02] god bless his word he may be seated in
[50:04] the presence of the lord
[50:07] and the lord said unto moses verse 15
[50:09] wherefore christ thou unto me
[50:12] speaking to the children of israel that
[50:14] they go forward
[50:16] speak that they go forward we certainly
[50:20] are looking at some very unprecedented
[50:24] times as a
[50:25] as a people and as a nation and
[50:27] certainly as a children of god we are
[50:29] being pressed like never before to
[50:31] to upkeep the standards of faith and to
[50:34] upkeep the standards of our religion
[50:36] that we believe that jesus christ is the
[50:38] son
[50:39] of the living god and we are oppressed
[50:42] on every side but we are not in despair
[50:45] we are we have been through we've been
[50:47] through the water and we have been
[50:48] through fires but yet we come out
[50:50] standing on the other side because we
[50:52] know that the god of the bible
[50:54] is the god that fights our battles and
[50:57] we as we see
[50:58] here as we're looking on the other side
[51:00] of exodus exodus 14
[51:02] we look and we can comb through the
[51:03] pages of the bible all the way from
[51:05] exodus 3 and
[51:06] we can see as god is placing his
[51:08] deliverer as he's sending him down with
[51:10] a message
[51:11] and then we can see him as he goes
[51:13] through the chaos of dealing with
[51:15] pharaoh and
[51:16] and dealing with dealing with these
[51:17] things and and realizing that moses is
[51:20] here in a ministry in a very
[51:22] powerful supernatural ministry that he's
[51:24] not witnessed before but yet that power
[51:27] is behind him and yet as moses steps
[51:30] into the role of the deliverer and the
[51:32] prophet of the day
[51:33] he steps into the midst of the greatest
[51:35] chaos that was getting ready to take
[51:37] place when
[51:38] when egypt ruled the world as it were in
[51:41] that time
[51:41] it was a midst of chaos that was getting
[51:44] ready to transpire
[51:45] as you watch as all of the plagues come
[51:47] upon egypt and
[51:49] as you watch as the power of god would
[51:51] come through moses as moses would speak
[51:53] these things and
[51:54] they would come into existence and you
[51:56] would watch as as
[51:57] egypt begin to put pressure upon the
[52:00] children of israel
[52:01] and you watch as these people that have
[52:03] been promised to deliver for
[52:05] for over 400 years as they see these
[52:07] promises as they're
[52:08] as they're coming into fruition and you
[52:11] see a people that they start recognizing
[52:13] that they are the people
[52:15] that were built for an exodus and that
[52:18] these were the people that would hear
[52:19] this message that would
[52:20] that would take them out of this chaos
[52:23] and here we are some 5 000
[52:25] years from that same time and here we
[52:28] are living in a time of the third exodus
[52:30] in the midst of chaos and
[52:32] in the midst of a world that's falling
[52:34] apart and everybody's calling for unity
[52:36] and everybody's pressing
[52:38] and they always see the pope as he's
[52:40] calling for a world council of churches
[52:42] and
[52:43] calling for unity and and you see as the
[52:45] as the world will turn their gaze upon
[52:47] the beast that
[52:48] they that roam that power and you see as
[52:51] she begins to call for the unity of
[52:53] people to come together
[52:55] but there has been another people that
[52:58] have already been united with their
[53:00] headship
[53:01] they have been united with their groom
[53:03] and it is now that it is in the time of
[53:06] trouble that he will lift his people
[53:08] off of the earth and it was in the midst
[53:10] of chaos that an exodus took place
[53:13] and it's in the midst of a chaos of this
[53:16] world
[53:16] that the king of peace comes and grabs
[53:18] his children
[53:19] out of a place where satan is the king
[53:22] of chaos
[53:22] and he grabs them from this world and
[53:25] you see
[53:26] there is no other people like it sitting
[53:28] on the face of the earth
[53:29] like you are people are calling for
[53:31] answers they're calling out they've got
[53:33] questions
[53:34] but there is a message that has the
[53:36] answer to
[53:37] everything that has been put in front of
[53:40] us
[53:40] and matter of fact you are the answer to
[53:43] the devil's question in this hour
[53:46] this is not a time to go backwards this
[53:48] is not a time to look back but this is a
[53:51] time to move forward
[53:52] in the promises of god and i promise you
[53:55] if you'll move forward in the word of
[53:57] god
[53:57] that the holy ghost will move you
[53:59] forward in his power
[54:02] and why god speak he would sit now with
[54:04] and now if any time
[54:05] looking at exodus chapter 14 that we've
[54:08] just read
[54:09] he said if any time that it ever looked
[54:12] like they ought to retreat it was then
[54:14] but god has no retreat there's no place
[54:18] to retreat in god it's go
[54:19] forward the doctor says cancer go
[54:22] forward
[54:23] if he says tb go forward if the devil
[54:26] says you can't give this up
[54:27] go forward if your home says that you're
[54:30] going to be a fanatic go forward
[54:32] the church turns you out go forward
[54:34] there's no retreating back it's go
[54:36] forward speak and go forward speak what
[54:40] his word and go forward thus save the
[54:42] lord and move on and
[54:44] cry out cry out so that people will know
[54:47] when you look at the bible and you see
[54:49] jesus after his
[54:50] baptism and the holy ghost comes and
[54:52] condescends upon
[54:53] and he on him as a form of a dove and
[54:56] john
[54:56] screams out behold the lamb of god
[54:59] immediately
[55:00] jesus goes from this spot where where
[55:03] god is identifying that this
[55:05] is his son that this is the one that
[55:08] will take away the sins of the world
[55:10] immediately he goes upon the mountain
[55:12] for 40 days
[55:13] and he's tempted by satan and satan
[55:16] comes to him with snares and traps
[55:19] and he's trying to control him in the
[55:20] spot where he's trying to push him into
[55:23] a spot
[55:23] and trap him into proving that he's the
[55:26] son of god but you watch what jesus did
[55:29] he never stayed in the enemy's trap he
[55:32] simply allowed the word
[55:34] to move him forward out of the trap of
[55:36] the enemy
[55:37] and that's what you must do as a
[55:39] children of god
[55:40] is you must allow the word of god to get
[55:43] you out of the trap
[55:44] it's not you that gets yourself out of
[55:46] there it's not you that gets yourself
[55:48] out of depression
[55:49] it's not you that gets yourself out of
[55:51] trouble it's not you that gets yourself
[55:54] out of situations
[55:55] that you got yourself in it's the word
[55:58] that will get you out of it
[55:59] and the word will get you out of it
[56:01] every single time
[56:02] brother burnham said that just simply
[56:05] repenting
[56:06] gets you out of the devil's trap that's
[56:08] why satan hates the power of prayer
[56:10] is when you go to praying that
[56:12] everything that has been
[56:14] done on your life goes back on the head
[56:17] of satan
[56:17] and he's responsible for the sin that
[56:20] you committed
[56:22] but he's responsible to take it back
[56:25] down to hell
[56:26] where you were meant to go you see
[56:29] there's no retreat there's no staying on
[56:31] the same ground he said let's move with
[56:33] the spirit
[56:34] or the spirit will move on to somebody
[56:37] else and leave you standing
[56:39] there is no neutral zone you either have
[56:41] the holy ghost
[56:42] or you don't have the holy ghost you're
[56:45] either a christian or you're not a
[56:47] christian
[56:48] now turn with me over to ezekiel chapter
[56:51] 1 and verse 4.
[56:53] a little lengthy scripture reading here
[56:55] but just bear with us
[56:57] ezekiel chapter one and verse four
[57:02] and i looked and and beheld behold a
[57:05] whirlwind came out of the north and
[57:07] a great cloud and a fire unfolding
[57:09] itself
[57:10] and a brightness was about it out of the
[57:12] midst thereof
[57:14] as the color of amber out of the midst
[57:16] of the fire
[57:17] we've seen that same fire in this
[57:19] building
[57:21] we're a witness at that same pillar of
[57:23] fire is even here tonight
[57:25] actually if you're a born again son and
[57:27] daughter of god he's in your heart
[57:29] you brought him here tonight he was he
[57:32] does not fill this house
[57:34] but he fills your heart and out of the
[57:37] midst thereof was a color of an
[57:39] amber out of the midst of the fire also
[57:41] out of the midst thereof came the
[57:43] likeness of all four living creatures
[57:45] and this was their appearance they had
[57:47] the likeness of a man and everyone had
[57:50] four faces and every one had four wings
[57:52] and their feet were straight feet in the
[57:54] and the sole of their feet was like the
[57:56] soles of a cast foot
[57:58] and they sparkled like the color of a
[57:59] burnished brass
[58:01] and they had hands of a man under the
[58:03] wings on their four sides and
[58:05] and they had four had their faces and
[58:07] their wings
[58:08] their wings were joined one to another
[58:10] they turned not when they went
[58:12] they went everyone straight forward as
[58:15] for the likeness of their faces they had
[58:17] four have the face of a man
[58:19] the face of a lion on the right side and
[58:21] the four had the face of an ox on the
[58:23] left side
[58:24] they four also had the face of an eagle
[58:26] thus were the faces and their wings were
[58:28] straight
[58:29] stretched up where two wings of every
[58:32] one were joined one to another
[58:34] and two covered their bodies verse 12
[58:37] and they went everyone straight forward
[58:39] whether the spirit was to go they went
[58:42] and they turned not when they went now
[58:45] we know that these are the anointings of
[58:47] the lord that that god would use
[58:50] and that god you can see them through
[58:51] several places throughout the bible
[58:53] but we realize that these are the
[58:55] anointings of the lord
[58:56] we watch as he would use the anointing
[58:59] of matthew in a lion
[59:00] we use it we watch it as he would use
[59:02] the anointing throughout the church ages
[59:04] of an
[59:04] ox and a man and even in this day of a
[59:07] flying eagle
[59:08] and we realize and we look at this
[59:10] scripture and you see that the anointing
[59:12] of the lord
[59:13] always goes forward you see they
[59:16] couldn't turn that anointing or
[59:18] or that time that anointing during that
[59:20] time could not turn
[59:22] it couldn't go this way it had to go the
[59:24] way that it was facing where it was
[59:26] facing
[59:27] there it had to go and where the spirit
[59:30] went that's where it had to go
[59:32] and we realized that those same
[59:33] anointings were guarding those same
[59:36] anointings were in matthew mark luke and
[59:38] john
[59:38] and what were they doing they were
[59:40] guarding the book of acts
[59:42] they were guarding the holy ghost and
[59:44] just like when you look at matthew
[59:46] chapter 28 and 19
[59:48] there it is that anointing is guarding
[59:50] the true baptism of the holy ghost
[59:52] of acts 2 and 38. that's why the church
[59:56] world can't grab ahold of it
[59:57] is because you see they are under that
[1:00:00] anoint they are guarded by that
[1:00:01] anointing where they're not allowed to
[1:00:03] walk
[1:00:04] but you are a people that have been led
[1:00:07] by an anointing
[1:00:08] to catch the revelation of the hour you
[1:00:11] see that anointing will never let you go
[1:00:13] back
[1:00:14] the anointing will never let you go back
[1:00:16] but the anointing
[1:00:17] will allow you to look back into the
[1:00:20] scriptures
[1:00:20] and see what jesus said and the
[1:00:23] anointing unveils it
[1:00:24] and it becomes a revelation to you you
[1:00:27] see they
[1:00:28] read the same scriptures that you read
[1:00:30] but they read it and they're completely
[1:00:32] blind
[1:00:33] you see if this gospel is heard it is
[1:00:36] here to them that are blind
[1:00:38] but here you are read the same
[1:00:40] scriptures that they read
[1:00:41] but because of the anointing and because
[1:00:44] the
[1:00:44] revelation that pushes you forward you
[1:00:47] cannot go
[1:00:48] back you cannot go back to ad238
[1:00:52] and catch that denominate the
[1:00:54] denominational idea
[1:00:56] of water baptism but the anointing
[1:01:00] allows you to catch the revelation of
[1:01:02] the hour
[1:01:03] but notice this that anointing will
[1:01:05] never allow you to go back
[1:01:07] but it always move you forward just like
[1:01:10] the same holy ghost
[1:01:11] that fell on the day of pentecost that
[1:01:13] same power will always move you
[1:01:16] into his promises that if he's still
[1:01:19] hebrews 13
[1:01:20] 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:01:23] and forever
[1:01:25] he must do the same thing that he did
[1:01:27] then if he healed then he's got to heal
[1:01:29] now
[1:01:30] if he's saved then he's got to save now
[1:01:32] if he delivered then he's got to deliver
[1:01:34] now
[1:01:35] if he failed then he's got to feel now
[1:01:38] as jesus said when he was speaking with
[1:01:40] nicodemus here on the new
[1:01:42] to the new birth doctrine his very first
[1:01:45] doctrine
[1:01:45] he begins to speak to him and he tells
[1:01:48] him in verse 8
[1:01:49] that the wind bloweth where it listeth
[1:01:51] and now hears the sound thereof
[1:01:53] but you can't tell where it come from
[1:01:55] and whether it goes
[1:01:57] so is everyone that is born of the
[1:01:59] spirit
[1:02:00] you realize that you are a paradox
[1:02:03] to satan himself he don't know how that
[1:02:06] power got on the inside of you
[1:02:08] he don't understand how the power that
[1:02:11] he wanted in heaven
[1:02:12] is now sitting in a body living in 16
[1:02:15] elements
[1:02:16] he don't understand where that power
[1:02:19] came from
[1:02:20] and how that power got in there
[1:02:23] hallelujah but because of the new birth
[1:02:26] you're just like the wind you can hear
[1:02:29] it but you can't see where it came from
[1:02:31] but the people that have been born again
[1:02:34] know exactly where it came from
[1:02:36] and they know exactly where it's taken
[1:02:38] them hallelujah you're going through
[1:02:40] laodicea but you're coming out of
[1:02:46] laodicea hallelujah
[1:02:49] you remember when the prophet was up
[1:02:51] there in canada and he was driving
[1:02:53] through that big burnover up there
[1:02:55] and he was driving down through there
[1:02:56] and he said it had been a big burn over
[1:02:58] and those
[1:02:58] those great big stately pines up there
[1:03:00] prayer as the wind would dry when as the
[1:03:03] wind would blow through those pines
[1:03:05] you could hear it because they had been
[1:03:07] through the trials of life and all the
[1:03:09] all the fires of life it had burned the
[1:03:11] life out of them
[1:03:13] and when that wind would go across him
[1:03:16] those trees would moan
[1:03:18] and groan under the power of that wind
[1:03:22] he said it would remind me of churches
[1:03:24] when you go to preaching about the
[1:03:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:27] they say that's nonsense it's for days
[1:03:30] gone by
[1:03:31] he said it remind me he said because you
[1:03:34] see
[1:03:35] the trials of life had burnt it had
[1:03:38] burnt the very life out of it and those
[1:03:41] those churches were always pointing back
[1:03:44] they're always pointing back to reform
[1:03:46] or
[1:03:47] pouring back to wesley pointing back to
[1:03:49] luther
[1:03:50] pointing back to their days brother
[1:03:52] branham would say that the church
[1:03:54] is living off of their past reputation
[1:03:56] but the bride is not living off a past
[1:03:59] reputation
[1:04:00] of acts chapter 2. she's living off of
[1:04:03] the word
[1:04:04] right now he said when i looked out
[1:04:07] there and i seen those pines
[1:04:09] that had been burnt over that was
[1:04:10] frolicking that was standing there and
[1:04:12] moaning
[1:04:13] he said i looked down low and there was
[1:04:15] some underbrush that was coming up
[1:04:17] he said there was some new life that was
[1:04:19] coming up and they were praising god
[1:04:21] for the wind that was going across them
[1:04:23] there's a lot of people that get excited
[1:04:26] and get all shook up because the power
[1:04:28] of the holy ghost coming
[1:04:29] but there's a people on earth today
[1:04:32] that still love a good gospel sermon
[1:04:35] they still love a good gospel
[1:04:38] word pouring out of the spirit they
[1:04:40] still enjoy when god comes down afresh
[1:04:46] hallelujah you see what satan is trying
[1:04:49] to do
[1:04:50] is that satan is trying to keep you from
[1:04:52] getting to the book of acts
[1:04:54] because if you get to the book of acts
[1:04:56] he knows that if you grab ahold of that
[1:04:58] book of acts
[1:04:59] that you will be exactly what he said
[1:05:02] that you will be
[1:05:03] exactly what the prophet said that
[1:05:05] you'll be an invincible army
[1:05:07] you'll to be be you'll be too powerful
[1:05:09] to be defeated
[1:05:10] that you'll be able to do the greater
[1:05:11] works
[1:05:13] satan has tried all his life trying to
[1:05:15] keep you from the book of acts
[1:05:17] but i found out a long time ago that
[1:05:20] satan
[1:05:21] is not the maker of my destiny
[1:05:24] but jesus christ is the one that
[1:05:26] predetermined me
[1:05:28] satan cannot check make god and put him
[1:05:31] in a corner
[1:05:32] but there is a power that pushes back
[1:05:34] against satan
[1:05:37] you see if satan could destroy the
[1:05:40] purpose of god
[1:05:41] he would be known as satan the almighty
[1:05:46] but the almighty was the one that
[1:05:48] created satan
[1:05:50] and satan is doing his best to try to
[1:05:52] keep you
[1:05:53] from the book of acts i got bad news
[1:05:57] i got bad news for the devil we are not
[1:06:00] just
[1:06:00] under an acts 2 anointing of the baptism
[1:06:03] of the holy
[1:06:04] ghost but we stand here in this hour
[1:06:07] under the anointing of the baptism of
[1:06:09] the holy ghost of acts 2
[1:06:10] but we also stand here under the
[1:06:12] anointing
[1:06:14] of the revelations 10 the mighty angel
[1:06:16] that has
[1:06:17] charged us to take this book has charged
[1:06:20] us to eat this book
[1:06:21] charge just become this book and the
[1:06:23] bible said that by one spirit
[1:06:25] we are baptized into one body how did
[1:06:28] you get in that body
[1:06:30] by one spirit hallelujah there's some
[1:06:33] people don't understand the spirit of
[1:06:35] god
[1:06:36] but i'm telling you tonight he's alive
[1:06:38] he's here
[1:06:39] and he's moving and the mighty angel is
[1:06:41] moving you
[1:06:43] he's moving a people into the perfection
[1:06:46] of the word
[1:06:47] so what power are you under
[1:06:51] you're either under your own power
[1:06:53] either under denominate power
[1:06:55] a demon power or you're under a church
[1:06:58] power
[1:06:59] now the church power only gets you to
[1:07:01] let you get so high
[1:07:02] your own self will only let you get so
[1:07:04] high but when
[1:07:05] god comes and fills you with his power
[1:07:08] he gives you his mind
[1:07:10] and there's nothing higher than god
[1:07:14] what power are you under
[1:07:17] this word that has been delivered in
[1:07:19] this day it will
[1:07:20] re it will produce a body that is fit
[1:07:24] for the headship of christ
[1:07:25] that the son of man could identify
[1:07:28] that's my body
[1:07:29] i'm speaking through that body and when
[1:07:32] moses would stand there and god would
[1:07:34] say why are you crying to me
[1:07:36] speak and go forward the son of man can
[1:07:38] look at his body
[1:07:39] and he said don't sit there don't sit
[1:07:42] there all shook up
[1:07:43] just simply speak you've got the word
[1:07:47] in your mouth the bible said the word is
[1:07:49] now the even in thy mouth
[1:07:51] and you notice what satan is trying to
[1:07:53] do in this day
[1:07:54] he's trying to silence the mouth of
[1:07:57] every born-again son and daughter of god
[1:08:01] i'm not just talking about your mouth
[1:08:03] i'm not just talking about your facebook
[1:08:05] i'm not just talking about your social
[1:08:07] agenda but i'm talking about you
[1:08:09] speaking the word
[1:08:10] he's trying to put every filter of doubt
[1:08:13] in your life
[1:08:14] to make you question everything that's
[1:08:16] been said but
[1:08:17] there is a spirit of truth that will
[1:08:19] guide you
[1:08:22] he is the author of all wisdom and he
[1:08:24] will guide you
[1:08:25] through all things
[1:08:30] he would say there's an hour coming when
[1:08:32] this world will shake under the impact
[1:08:36] of the church of the living god that's
[1:08:38] moving forward in great power
[1:08:40] the power that's moving you
[1:08:44] the power that's moving you is not some
[1:08:46] jet power
[1:08:47] it's not some rocket power you are
[1:08:50] powered by a holy ghost fuel that never
[1:08:53] runs out
[1:08:55] it never failed in the mouth of early
[1:08:57] believers of the early apostles
[1:08:59] and it won't fail today that same power
[1:09:03] that same power that chains saul to paul
[1:09:06] is the same power
[1:09:07] that was poured out on the day of
[1:09:09] pentecost it was the same power
[1:09:11] that delivered legion it was the same
[1:09:13] power
[1:09:14] that when polycarp was being burned at
[1:09:16] the stake
[1:09:17] it was the same power that pushed those
[1:09:20] flames away
[1:09:21] from polycarp's body it's the same power
[1:09:24] that will lift you out of the layout of
[1:09:26] sea and flames that are trying to
[1:09:28] encapsulate you
[1:09:29] in getting involved in this world it's
[1:09:32] the same power that's going to lift you
[1:09:34] off of this earth the same power
[1:09:38] that raised jesus from the grave he's
[1:09:40] alive in a people
[1:09:44] and the son of man is still speaking and
[1:09:46] the son of man is still conquering
[1:09:48] and the son of man which is the word is
[1:09:50] defeating satan in your body
[1:09:53] now the son of man is in a body that he
[1:09:56] can lay his head down
[1:09:57] that he can rest his body in he is now
[1:10:00] living in a body that he can trust
[1:10:02] a body that he can move in a body that
[1:10:05] is living in
[1:10:06] with the same resurrection power and
[1:10:08] he's living in a body
[1:10:10] that's willing to put their hands
[1:10:12] against the stone and roll the stone
[1:10:14] away from the grave as same as he did
[1:10:16] 2 000 years ago that same power
[1:10:21] is living in a body that has been
[1:10:23] feeding on the unfailing body word
[1:10:25] of the son of man
[1:10:29] hallelujah what power you under
[1:10:32] are you under your own control or is god
[1:10:35] controlling you
[1:10:36] who was controlling moses when he was
[1:10:38] standing there
[1:10:40] and told him to pick up his rod who was
[1:10:42] controlling a prophet when he said speak
[1:10:45] to that storm
[1:10:46] who was controlling who was controlling
[1:10:50] your pastor
[1:10:51] when he spoke the things that were
[1:10:53] impossible who's controlling you
[1:11:02] hallelujah
[1:11:05] it's time to walk out
[1:11:08] it's time to walk out of laodicea
[1:11:12] it's time to give up on the world that
[1:11:13] you live in
[1:11:15] and move into the world that you belong
[1:11:17] in
[1:11:20] now notice what he says here he said we
[1:11:22] he said we've lived
[1:11:24] the time out at the time of the rapture
[1:11:28] is at hand where
[1:11:29] we're looking for a rapturing faith that
[1:11:31] can pull the church together
[1:11:33] and give it some supernatural stent
[1:11:35] strength
[1:11:36] that can change these bodies that we
[1:11:38] live in he says when we see a god
[1:11:41] that can raise the dead off of the floor
[1:11:44] have we seen that
[1:11:46] or out of the yard and bring him back to
[1:11:48] life again
[1:11:49] and present him before us he said when
[1:11:52] we see a god who can
[1:11:54] take a cancer let's eat a man to a
[1:11:56] shadow and raise him up to a strong
[1:11:58] healthy man
[1:11:59] that ought to give rapturing faith to
[1:12:02] the people
[1:12:04] have you not seen in your own midst
[1:12:06] church
[1:12:07] the dead be raised to life again
[1:12:10] have you not seen in your own midst men
[1:12:13] that had been
[1:12:14] eaten up with cancer men that have
[1:12:17] different prognosis of where
[1:12:18] cancers was they can eat them up to a
[1:12:21] shadow
[1:12:22] and raise them back should that not give
[1:12:24] us a rapturing faith
[1:12:27] that faith is a rapturing faith that
[1:12:30] will put you
[1:12:32] where satan can never get you
[1:12:36] write that down you say you're
[1:12:40] you're not some school girl you're not
[1:12:43] just some
[1:12:43] average lady walking down the street
[1:12:46] before you ever got here
[1:12:48] he placed the wedding band of unmerited
[1:12:51] grace upon your finger
[1:12:53] the reason why you believe what you
[1:12:55] believe is because
[1:12:56] he slipped that wedding band on your
[1:12:58] finger
[1:13:01] when i whisper though sweet i love yous
[1:13:03] to my little wife
[1:13:05] she believes me when i tell her things
[1:13:07] that are hardly
[1:13:08] that are hard to believe she believes me
[1:13:11] because i slipped
[1:13:12] that wedding band upon her and when
[1:13:15] jesus has promised you something
[1:13:18] you can go to the bank with it
[1:13:21] if he said he's coming he's coming if he
[1:13:24] said he heal you
[1:13:25] he healed you if he said he'd give you a
[1:13:27] baby he'll give you a baby
[1:13:29] if he said he'd deliver you he'll
[1:13:31] deliver you what
[1:13:32] power are you under
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:39] so many people want to be controlled by
[1:13:40] a different power of today
[1:13:42] they want to try to control themselves
[1:13:44] and say well i'm going to live for
[1:13:45] myself
[1:13:46] you can't even figure out what you want
[1:13:48] to eat for breakfast but yet you're
[1:13:49] going to try to make yourself live right
[1:13:52] good luck oh hallelujah
[1:13:56] but there is a power that is present
[1:13:58] right now
[1:13:59] that has ever already picked out
[1:14:01] everything you like
[1:14:02] and put it on the other side he's

[1:14:10] gold it's got walls of jasper
[1:14:12] gates of pearl and there is no light in
[1:14:15] that city
[1:14:16] you don't need a light when the lamb is

[1:14:20] he has picked out everything according
[1:14:24] to the way that you like it

[1:14:40] going and something just led him to go

[1:25:03] yes the world says that the children
[1:25:05] rule the parent
[1:25:06] but i believe that it was god's word

[1:25:40] world say hey
[1:25:42] this is a holy house and what happens
[1:25:44] here
[1:25:45] is going to happen by the power of the
[1:25:47] holy ghost and if you're not
[1:25:48] willing to do what is right
[1:25:55] now if they are still under the age
[1:25:59] of accountability you are their holy
[1:26:01] ghost
[1:26:04] you are their holy ghost and it is your
[1:26:07] duty
[1:26:08] to make sure they know what is right
[1:26:12] it's not delinquent children it's
[1:26:14] delinquent parents
[1:26:16] that have ruined america
[1:26:26] let me move on
[1:26:30] the bible says in ecclesiastes 7 and 8
[1:26:35] that better is the end of a thing than
[1:26:38] the beginning thereof
[1:26:41] better is the end of a thing than the
[1:26:44] beginning thereof
[1:26:46] and the patient in spirit is better than
[1:26:48] the proud in spirit
[1:26:50] better is the end of a thing than the
[1:26:53] beginning of it
[1:26:55] you remember when joseph as brother
[1:26:58] matthew was speaking on last weekend on
[1:26:59] joseph
[1:27:00] how that he was how that joseph went
[1:27:03] from just being a dreamer boy
[1:27:05] that was telling his brothers that this
[1:27:08] is what god has shown me
[1:27:10] that he took him from a pit that he took
[1:27:12] him from a prison
[1:27:13] that he took him to second in command
[1:27:16] that better was the end of a thing than
[1:27:18] the beginning thereof
[1:27:19] that just because he was that just
[1:27:22] because he risen to a power
[1:27:23] there was something better that was
[1:27:25] coming than just second in power
[1:27:28] he rose to second in command that
[1:27:30] everybody had to obey
[1:27:32] and listen to what joseph said but there
[1:27:34] was something better that was coming
[1:27:37] that joseph couldn't even see but he
[1:27:39] told
[1:27:40] he told the children of israel he said
[1:27:42] don't you leave my bones down here
[1:27:45] because there is coming something better
[1:27:47] in my end
[1:27:48] than was what in my beginning he knew
[1:27:51] that there was a resurrection coming
[1:27:54] over in israel over in jerusalem and he
[1:27:57] said don't you leave my bones down here
[1:28:00] in this world of chaos take me out of
[1:28:02] here
[1:28:03] because better is the end of the thing
[1:28:05] than the better than the beginning
[1:28:09] job job was a man that was perfect
[1:28:12] job was a man that stood before god and
[1:28:15] the bible said
[1:28:17] that job that god and satan had a
[1:28:20] conversation about
[1:28:21] job he asked satan have you considered
[1:28:24] my servant job
[1:28:26] and satan said i can't get to him he
[1:28:28] said i've looked at him but i can't get
[1:28:30] to him
[1:28:31] because i you've put a heads around him
[1:28:33] that ought to show every child of god
[1:28:36] that god's placed their heads about you
[1:28:38] it ain't a bush that he's talking about
[1:28:40] here i heard somebody telling me other
[1:28:42] day said hey if god's going to put a
[1:28:44] hedge around me
[1:28:45] i'd rather be a i'd rather be a wall
[1:28:47] than a bush
[1:28:48] but if you look into what that hedge
[1:28:50] means it means that he's fortified you
[1:28:53] with spears and swords
[1:28:57] he's put a hedge of a wall of fire
[1:28:59] around you
[1:29:00] that satan can't get through and if say
[1:29:04] if god allows satan to come over there
[1:29:07] and do something to you god's got
[1:29:09] confidence in you
[1:29:10] that you're going to come out of it and
[1:29:12] better was the end of a thing
[1:29:14] than was what in the beginning of job's
[1:29:17] life
[1:29:19] you remember when the sunnah might was
[1:29:20] promised that she would
[1:29:22] receive a child better was the end of a
[1:29:25] thing
[1:29:25] than there was in the beginning because
[1:29:28] you remember when the pseudomy woman
[1:29:29] started walking towards the prophet
[1:29:32] she walked up there and she walked up
[1:29:34] there even though her son had died
[1:29:36] with a heat stroke and she walked up
[1:29:38] towards elijah
[1:29:40] and he asked oh he's all well she said
[1:29:43] all
[1:29:44] is well but my son has died
[1:29:47] the one you promised me he said but
[1:29:50] better is the end of the thing
[1:29:52] than the beginning thereof and he said
[1:29:54] to hazel
[1:29:55] you take my staff down there you take my
[1:29:58] staff down there and lay that on that
[1:30:00] boy
[1:30:00] and he'll come back to life but he
[1:30:02] realized the prophet realized real
[1:30:04] quickly
[1:30:05] that the woman's faith was not in that
[1:30:09] staff
[1:30:09] it was in the prophet
[1:30:13] and when the prophet caught the vision
[1:30:15] of her faith
[1:30:16] he went down there and laid on top of
[1:30:18] that boy sneezed seven times
[1:30:21] and the boy came back to life
[1:30:24] better was the end of the thing than the
[1:30:26] beginning thereof
[1:30:33] let me tell you something you've gone
[1:30:34] through some stuff you're going through
[1:30:36] some wrecks of life but better is the
[1:30:38] end of the thing
[1:30:39] than the beginning of it you come
[1:30:42] through layout i see you you come to the
[1:30:44] trials of life
[1:30:45] but better is the end
[1:30:48] you're not just serving a god that's
[1:30:50] hiding the future from you he's already
[1:30:52] showed the future to you
[1:30:54] and he is telling you that better is the
[1:30:56] end
[1:30:57] than the beginning you enjoyed the holy
[1:31:00] ghost when i gave it to you
[1:31:02] but the end is better than when you got
[1:31:04] it
[1:31:08] as a musician comes
[1:31:14] hallelujah
[1:31:18] when the children of israel been out at
[1:31:20] war
[1:31:22] they've been fighting they lost some
[1:31:24] brothers in battle
[1:31:27] if you read through history
[1:31:30] it'll tell you that the closer
[1:31:33] that they got they didn't get more
[1:31:36] discouraged
[1:31:38] the closer they got back to jerusalem
[1:31:40] the more cheerful they got
[1:31:44] instead of being so tore up by the
[1:31:46] battle and by the difficulties of the
[1:31:48] battle
