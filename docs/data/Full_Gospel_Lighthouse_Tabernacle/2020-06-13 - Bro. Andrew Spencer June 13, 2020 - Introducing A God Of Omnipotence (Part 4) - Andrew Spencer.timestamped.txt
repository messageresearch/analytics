[24:28] father Lord Jesus what a privilege Lord
[24:31] it is to call you Father Lord because if
[24:33] you are our Father then that means that
[24:35] we are your children father that we came
[24:37] from your own bowels father Lord and we
[24:40] came as attributes expressed in the
[24:42] earth father in these bodies Lord and
[24:44] Lord Jesus despite of what the body
[24:47] feels Lord despite of if the body even
[24:49] feels like it we're here to praise you
[24:51] father we're here to lift up your name
[24:53] on high because you're so worthy father

[25:03] for being so good to us father Lord
[25:06] Jesus you're so good even in the
[25:08] apparent bad times are still good and
[25:10] Lord Jesus we just want to lift up your
[25:12] name that worthy name of the Lord Jesus
[25:14] Christ ever so high this evening the
[25:17] Lord Jesus we want to come boldly in
[25:19] that name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[25:21] Lord God we want to plead that precious
[25:23] blood of Jesus Christ upon our own
[25:25] unworthy lives father Lord while we were
[25:28] yet sinners the Bible tells us that she
[25:30] came and you died for a sorority you
[25:32] were in the Garden of Gethsemane you
[25:34] were sweating drops of blood and you're
[25:36] the very your very chemistry of your
[25:38] blood even separated in your body under
[25:40] that stress father but Lord even there
[25:43] you were thinking of this moment even
[25:44] there you were thinking of us father in
[25:48] Lord Jesus if he would had to do all
[25:49] that for one Lord Jesus you would have
[25:52] done it father what love what matchless
[25:54] love father and then as we think Lord of
[25:57] your road to the cross father where you
[25:59] had to complete that full redemption and
[26:02] he sat there in pilot's judgments Hall
[26:04] father and he took that crown of thorns
[26:06] and he took them stripes upon that holy
[26:09] nor do you never send one time in your
[26:11] life because you're holy because you're
[26:14] God but he sat there lorded because you
[26:16] had a word to fulfill you had a people
[26:19] God that was to be expressed upon the
[26:22] earth and he took him straps you took
[26:24] him stripes and patterned on tails upon
[26:26] your back and no doubt father Lord
[26:28] there's no doubt in my mind you were
[26:30] thinking of us you were thinking of our
[26:32] needs there was it was a prophecy in
[26:35] Isaiah lore that said you had to be
[26:36] bruised for our iniquities the
[26:39] chastisement of our peace had to be upon
[26:42] you nor we worship you for this we
[26:46] worship you for what you've done Lord
[26:47] and father God we lived Eve each and
[26:49] every need father Lord that was read
[26:51] across his pulpit this evening or meet
[26:54] each every need father Lord this the
[26:57] ones that are at home sick or that wish
[26:58] they could be here so bad the unspoken

[50:18] about a shout service where the whole
[50:21] heavens and earth were to shout worthy
[50:23] is the lamb father pray that you would
[50:26] just give us in our human vessels the
[50:29] capacity to be able to express it to our
[50:31] neighbor express it to our loved ones or
[50:37] Express how great you are amongst us and
[50:41] the things that you're doing well God we
[50:43] know that no no man and no tongue could
[50:47] tell God for the marvelous acts that
[50:51] we've seen amongst us they've been you
[50:54] the whole time Lord to think that you've
[50:57] had us in your hand the whole
[51:00] of our life and to think that you're
[51:02] here the here to speak to every one of
[51:06] your children's needs father seeing the

[51:23] control of the order of this service
[51:26] father and studying these things looking
[51:30] over these things
[51:31] father what it needs is is the capping
[51:35] of the Holy Spirit to call cap this
[51:38] service off of the name father we've
[51:41] been looking at this law on the god

[52:19] daughter Katie
[52:23] humbly ask for Jesus and take control
[52:26] now give myself over to thee the
[52:29] building of I came to just Jesus bless
[52:35] you if you have your Bibles you turn
[52:37] with me over to 2nd Kings chapter 2 and
[52:39] 11 second Kings chapter 2 and verse 11
[52:50] again we would like to speak to you on
[52:53] introducing the god of omnipotence sure
[53:10] thank the Lord for the word that our
[53:12] prior pastor was able to speak to us
[53:15] last weekend and and just to me it was a
[53:18] very divine Oracle of God to be able to
[53:21] speak to us to tell us to look past what
[53:23] we see to look past what we feel to me
[53:27] that came from another realm and and
[53:30] that's what we want to do here tonight
[53:31] is to look past look past what we see
[53:35] and look past this flesh of humanity and
[53:38] just look to his word just for a moment
[53:40] 2nd Kings chapter 2 and 11 and it came
[53:43] to pass as they still want went on and
[53:46] talked that behold there appeared a a
[53:48] chariot of fire and horses of fire and
[53:51] and parted them both asunder and Elijah
[53:54] went up by whirlwind into heaven and
[53:57] Elisha saw it and cried my father my
[54:00] father the chariot of Israel and the
[54:02] horseman thereof and he and he saw him
[54:04] no more and he took hold of his own
[54:06] clothes and read them into pieces and he
[54:10] took up also the mountain of Elisha that
[54:12] fell from him and went back and stood by
[54:15] the bank of Jordan and he took the
[54:18] mantle of Elijah that fell from him and
[54:20] smote the waters and said where is the
[54:22] Lord God of Elijah and when he had also
[54:25] spent in the waters they departed hither
[54:27] and thither and Elijah went over and god
[54:29] bless his word he may be seated in the
[54:31] presence of the Lord
[54:33] we truly believe that that in this hour
[54:36] in this moment in time that we have been
[54:39] seeing a God of power been displayed in
[54:42] front of us and here as we've read over
[54:45] this scripture reading for the last
[54:46] three services that we've taken that
[54:49] that God was here in his prophet Elijah
[54:52] and here God was taking him off the
[54:54] scene as it were and taking him on but
[54:57] we know that Elijah did not die but
[55:00] Elijah was translated and there there we
[55:03] see the second rapture in the Bible and
[55:05] we see here as Elijah is coming down at
[55:08] the closing out hours of Elijah's
[55:11] ministry and we watch and we were
[55:13] watching Elijah in this very critical
[55:16] moment in his own life to see whether
[55:19] God was still present or not and here we
[55:22] see Allah says he stands there and he's
[55:24] standing under he's stunned
[55:26] standing under one of the greatest
[55:28] ministries that has ever been in in the
[55:31] time of the prophets it's been in a time
[55:33] of the Bible as as we would speak but
[55:35] here Elijah has been God's vindicated
[55:38] messenger and he's done the miraculous
[55:40] and he's done the supernatural and here
[55:43] Elijah is standing there and he's asked
[55:45] this petition of the of Elijah that he
[55:48] would give him a double portion of his
[55:50] spirit and allowed to give him a
[55:52] commission he said now when you if you
[55:54] see me when I go then you'll know that
[55:57] you have these things and here Elijah is
[56:00] watching these things and as we watch as
[56:03] Elijah is on the other side of the
[56:05] Jordan with Elijah he smites the waters
[56:08] and he walks across now we're coming
[56:11] down to a very critical moment in
[56:13] Elijah's ministry it's the beginning of
[56:15] his ministry as his servant Elijah has
[56:18] just went off the scene by the chariot
[56:20] of fire just familiarizing yourself with
[56:22] the story just now but we're watching as
[56:25] Elijah comes down to these waters it's
[56:27] in a moment when when maybe he's in a
[56:30] moment of despair or a moment where he
[56:32] don't know what to do but it was a
[56:33] moment when God would show up and we
[56:36] watch as Elijah's last miracle was
[56:39] Elijah's first miracle and it was
[56:41] showing to us that the same life and the
[56:44] same spirit of Allah
[56:46] had came back upon his servant alive so
[56:48] this was a spirit of Christ that was
[56:51] upon his prophet Elijah and here he was
[56:54] showing that the same prophet Elijah
[56:56] that had walked over before was now the
[56:59] same God that was with Elijah and the
[57:02] same God that was with Elijah and the
[57:04] same God was with Elijah he was showing
[57:07] that he was able to do and repeat the
[57:10] process again he was showing that he was
[57:13] God over nature he was God over the
[57:15] circumstances and Allah says that a paw
[57:18] at a spot when the the critics and the
[57:21] skeptics are on the other side of the
[57:23] bank you're talking about a spot in life
[57:25] and you think you got critics and you
[57:27] think you got skeptics or people looking
[57:29] at you and Laodicea but there is a time
[57:31] when when everybody in those on the
[57:34] other side of the river and you're the
[57:35] only say or you're the only man standing
[57:37] there you're all by yourself you ain't
[57:39] got nobody else with you ain't got
[57:41] yourself where you can sit down talk to
[57:42] your pastor talk to your prophet well my
[57:45] prophet just went away and I don't have
[57:47] nobody to talk to but it was a spot in
[57:49] which God would show up and you see
[57:52] Elijah knew where he was standing at a
[57:54] loss and knew who he was he knew he was
[57:57] called to this spot in life because you
[57:59] see he had seen when Elijah watched him
[58:03] as he was there plowing in the field and
[58:05] Elijah to his mat or overall him it was
[58:07] showing that he had chose him to be his
[58:10] successor
[58:11] now we realize today that there is going
[58:13] to be a continuation of the ministry of
[58:16] Christ it is not a succession of brother
[58:19] branham's ministry we're not looking for
[58:21] his son to take over we're not looking
[58:23] for another man to take over but we are
[58:25] watching a continuation of the Ministry
[58:28] of Jesus Christ and we are told that
[58:30] Elijah and Elijah is a perfect type of
[58:33] Christ and His Church and we are seeing
[58:36] here a type of you and I with Christ
[58:39] showing that the same works that he did
[58:42] is the same works that you and I will do
[58:44] so if Christ did it then it's got to be
[58:48] a body on earth right now that would do
[58:50] the same thing that Jesus did 2,000
[58:53] years ago
[58:53] if
[58:54] is the god of omnipotence if he is the
[58:57] God of all power if he is the god of
[59:00] omnipresent that means he's got to be
[59:02] here that means he's got to show up when
[59:04] you come down to a spot of criticism
[59:07] that's a god that you can count on when
[59:09] your brother ain't there when your
[59:10] neighbor ain't there
[59:11] God's there when the people that stood
[59:15] with you no longer stand with you that's
[59:18] a god that's still standing there's a
[59:21] God that is here and he's moving and
[59:23] he's acting and he's receiving blessings
[59:25] from his children as they allow him to
[59:28] walk through their life I like to read
[59:33] this to you again as we read it but from
[59:36] the second inotrope when he came down to
[59:38] that Jordan down to the Jordan to face
[59:41] the critical world what did he cry where
[59:44] is the god of Elijah it wasn't the robe
[59:47] of Elijah the donut it was the power of
[59:49] God
[59:50] other lyza that had done it and the
[59:52] thing the world needs this morning is
[59:54] the power of God of Elijah you might
[59:56] have spoke of tongues and shouted and
[59:59] run over the floor but what we need
[1:00:01] hallelujah what we need is the power of
[1:00:04] the God of Pentecost to produce the
[1:00:07] lives and things that was lived in that
[1:00:09] day in the apostolic hour a
[1:00:11] second-handed robe was alright
[1:00:14] hallelujah but he needed a fresh call in
[1:00:17] his heart from God he needed a fresh
[1:00:19] anointing from God he wore a
[1:00:21] second-handed robe when he came to the
[1:00:23] river but he needed a brand new first
[1:00:25] hand a call from God and a first handed
[1:00:27] power from God to perform the miracle
[1:00:29] and my brother don't you be afraid to
[1:00:32] ask God anything you must demand God or
[1:00:34] ask God for anything that is promised
[1:00:37] for if I am introducing a god that's
[1:00:40] omnipotent and all-powerful if I be a
[1:00:42] servant of God I must do the works of
[1:00:45] God and if I do the works of God I must
[1:00:47] be a man of God to bring these things to
[1:00:50] pass because he's demanding of me to
[1:00:53] produce the impossible I have to ask him
[1:00:56] I have to call upon him and stand there
[1:00:59] and say God you promised it so do you
[1:01:01] every person you shall receive power
[1:01:04] after the Holy Spirit has come upon you
[1:01:07] after the
[1:01:07] holy spirit has come upon you after your
[1:01:10] robe that's a Christian after your faith
[1:01:13] is set in Christ then you shall receive
[1:01:16] power there you are you see it's not
[1:01:18] something that you have to work yourself
[1:01:20] up into you're not going to have to
[1:01:22] stand there and watch deep calleth to
[1:01:24] the deep and watch all those things that
[1:01:26] transpire across the earth across the
[1:01:29] platform and you try to come there and
[1:01:31] stand behind the platform try to act
[1:01:33] like William Branham did it's nothing
[1:01:35] it's nothing that you have to work
[1:01:37] yourself up into those things are
[1:01:39] sovereignly given and those things are
[1:01:41] given by God and if God wants to display
[1:01:44] his power no matter if it's it maybe
[1:01:47] it's in a widow that he wants to display
[1:01:48] his power to it is God that is
[1:01:51] sovereignly giving those things and it's
[1:01:53] God that is sovereignly doing those
[1:01:54] things so it's not something that we
[1:01:57] work ourselves up into but there is a
[1:01:59] power that lays on the inside of the
[1:02:01] bride of Jesus Christ no matter what how
[1:02:03] long you been a Christian you may have
[1:02:05] never seen one miracle in your own
[1:02:07] entire life except for your
[1:02:09] transformation of your soul but God will
[1:02:12] bring you down to the very last of your
[1:02:14] life and all of a sudden he'll call you
[1:02:16] to your ministry as a housewife to call
[1:02:20] things back into an order and that God
[1:02:23] was showing up in your life you didn't
[1:02:26] work yourself up into it but there was a
[1:02:28] capacity of the Holy Ghost on the inside
[1:02:31] of you all of that time but he was
[1:02:34] waiting for one moment to display
[1:02:36] himself through you hallelujah you see
[1:02:42] what good does it do to preach a god of
[1:02:44] history if he isn't the same today
[1:02:46] brother sister I say this I read I read
[1:02:50] of a God of history one time I read of
[1:02:52] him in books I read of him in the Bible
[1:02:53] but one day I met him
[1:02:56] I met him he came to me told me not to
[1:02:58] drink or smoke her to fly myself and he
[1:03:01] had something for me to do and when I
[1:03:02] got a little older I just a little boy
[1:03:05] and he proved that he did it and here's
[1:03:07] his picture hanging right here now if
[1:03:09] sign has tooked it the world knows that
[1:03:12] he's proved it among gay he knows every
[1:03:14] thought in your heart he's proved his
[1:03:16] if the same God today he's not a God of
[1:03:19] history don't be just don't let the
[1:03:22] world smuggle you down with the smut and
[1:03:24] stuff of the world believe him right now
[1:03:26] so if we're preaching to you a god that
[1:03:29] is Hebrews 13:8 that means he's got to
[1:03:32] be the same in every detail in every
[1:03:35] aspect of who he is that means he can't
[1:03:38] change but there's a people there are
[1:03:41] people that that say that they're
[1:03:43] followers of Christ or or they say that
[1:03:46] they're followers of the message but
[1:03:47] they never have met him now how can you
[1:03:50] be a follower if you've never met him
[1:03:53] but if you have met him you can say I
[1:03:56] know in whom I have believed I know in
[1:03:58] whom there is power but the resurrection
[1:04:00] that baptized my soul afresh and he's
[1:04:04] good enough to take me out of this world
[1:04:06] and take me into a body where I feel no
[1:04:09] pain where I feel no anguish hallelujah
[1:04:15] the Bible says in Ephesians 3 and 14
[1:04:19] notice what the word Paul is presenting
[1:04:22] here that this is a part of your
[1:04:24] inheritance as a parallel between a
[1:04:27] Joshua and Ephesians but here Paul was
[1:04:30] presenting a prayer for spirits of
[1:04:34] strength and Paul says this for this
[1:04:37] cause I bow my knees under the father of
[1:04:39] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[1:04:43] family in heaven and earth is named
[1:04:45] notice for this cost verse 14 4:16 that
[1:04:49] he would grant you according to the
[1:04:52] riches of the glory of his glory to be
[1:04:55] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:04:58] the inner man not just this flesh not
[1:05:01] just your spirit but the inner man that
[1:05:04] Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith
[1:05:07] that he being rooted and grounded in
[1:05:10] love notice what Paul was presenting to
[1:05:13] you is that he is praying the prayer
[1:05:16] over you he's praying the prayer of
[1:05:19] spiritual strength overtop of you
[1:05:22] the children of God Paul knew the power
[1:05:26] of prayer and God and and Paul knew that
[1:05:28] there was power over praying over the
[1:05:32] Church of Ephesus
[1:05:33] now if that be so in that day it's gotta
[1:05:37] be the same thing today
[1:05:38] and as I watch as you're as her pastor
[1:05:41] as he prays for your strength by the
[1:05:43] rain as he prays for your natural
[1:05:45] abilities out watch as God shows forth
[1:05:49] his power
[1:05:50] shows forth his strength in your life
[1:05:54] you see now notice in the Smyrna church
[1:05:57] age he said you see the one difference
[1:06:00] between Israel and the rest of the
[1:06:02] nation was God that was the key he said
[1:06:12] you put God to one side and Israel is
[1:06:14] like any other nation he said when
[1:06:16] Samson cut off his hair he was like any
[1:06:18] other man now notice he said you put the
[1:06:21] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[1:06:23] the church is nothing but the world with
[1:06:26] God's name attached to it whoo
[1:06:29] hallelujah put the leadership of the
[1:06:32] Holy Ghost aside put him in your box put
[1:06:37] him where you don't want him and the
[1:06:39] church is nothing but the wall with
[1:06:42] God's name attached to it I don't want
[1:06:46] to come borrowed over this chart to her
[1:06:48] over your heart I wrote over our life he
[1:06:51] said the world and the church are all of
[1:06:53] the same lump just like Jacob and Esau
[1:06:57] are the same parents but the Spirit of
[1:07:00] God makes the difference it doesn't
[1:07:03] matter if you call yourself a Christian
[1:07:05] anyone can do that the point is whether
[1:07:08] or not you have the Spirit of God in you
[1:07:11] for without that spirit you are
[1:07:13] reprobate and you are none of his amen
[1:07:17] you see they both had the same parents
[1:07:20] but the difference was the birth the
[1:07:23] difference was the birthright and the
[1:07:26] difference between you and the rest of
[1:07:28] the wall is your birth
[1:07:31] Oh hallelujah it's not just a feeling of
[1:07:33] a sanctification well you've been set
[1:07:36] aside for service and you feel a
[1:07:38] tingling of the Holy Ghost on your flesh
[1:07:39] and you say oh my god I got it when I
[1:07:42] felt that that rush just reached down
[1:07:44] and roll over the back of my neck oh I
[1:07:46] got I got it but you can't live one day
[1:07:49] right you ain't got it but all I let me
[1:07:54] tell you something if you get baptized
[1:07:56] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the
[1:07:59] inside of your soul you can say brother
[1:08:01] Santa I got it I got it you know what
[1:08:05] you got because the God are got you
[1:08:11] hallelujah and when Jacob was coming
[1:08:14] down to the meeting when he when he left
[1:08:16] Laban and he left everything that he
[1:08:18] knew here it is coming down to a spot
[1:08:21] when he's coming back to meet his
[1:08:22] brother Esau and Jacob is afraid he's
[1:08:27] coming back to his Spotty's he's
[1:08:29] disturbed he's perplexed he don't know
[1:08:31] what to do so he sets his wife's and his
[1:08:34] children and all of his all of his men
[1:08:36] servants on the other side of the brook
[1:08:38] and there Jacob goes on the other side
[1:08:41] of that brook and he goes to have
[1:08:43] himself a conference and he goes to an
[1:08:45] unexpected place the Prophet said in an
[1:08:48] unexpected time and he met God in an
[1:08:50] unexpected way and how did he meet God
[1:08:54] it was in a wrestling match now I don't
[1:08:56] know if he put if he put a knuckle
[1:08:58] shuffle on him or if he put a dive
[1:09:00] bomber on him or if he put him in a
[1:09:02] headlock but the angel got hold of him
[1:09:05] the angel got ahold of him in such a way
[1:09:07] that he wouldn't gonna let him go and
[1:09:09] Jacob got a hold of the angel and he
[1:09:12] said I'm not gonna let you go until you
[1:09:14] bless me now I don't care whether it's
[1:09:16] in a wrestling match and he's got you in
[1:09:18] a headlock and tells you and he starts
[1:09:20] rubbing your head get rid of your snake
[1:09:22] and thinking and start taking on my
[1:09:24] thinking oh I wish he'd grab a hold of
[1:09:26] some of your heads tonight grab hold of
[1:09:29] your children's life grab ahold of them
[1:09:30] produções life and put them in a
[1:09:32] headlock
[1:09:36] you're coming you're coming whether you
[1:09:39] like it or whether you don't because I
[1:09:41] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:09:43] world hallelujah I know one day he put
[1:09:46] me in a headlock I was running into
[1:09:48] every witch away from this altar from
[1:09:50] this God and one day God put me in a
[1:09:52] headlock and he changed my thinking over
[1:09:56] the heads thinking whew hello there he
[1:10:02] met God in a wrestling match but it was
[1:10:06] God that was a difference hallelujah
[1:10:10] no doubt Jacob had got himself in
[1:10:12] trouble a few times in his life he'd
[1:10:14] wrestled around no doubt with his
[1:10:15] brother I know you boys ain't never done
[1:10:17] nothing like it but you've got yourself
[1:10:20] wrestle around with people and different
[1:10:22] things he'd wrestled around he got
[1:10:23] himself in some trouble every once in a
[1:10:25] while but this time he got more than he
[1:10:27] bargained for but this time he didn't
[1:10:30] leave there all bloodied up and all
[1:10:33] messed up in the face but this time he
[1:10:35] walked away they're walking a little bit
[1:10:37] different he walked away a limp and
[1:10:41] Prince with power and the main thing was
[1:10:47] that Jacob he had dreams and he had
[1:10:49] visions and so forth but this one time
[1:10:52] had come and laid his hand on something
[1:10:54] to say it's God and he was able to hold
[1:10:56] on to it until the blessing came and ho
[1:10:59] if we could do that if we could find a
[1:11:00] spot to where God would see God we could
[1:11:03] see God whether it's in his word
[1:11:04] wherever it is and recognizes God and
[1:11:07] hold on to it until the blessing comes
[1:11:09] wrestle it out with God God promised to
[1:11:12] do it God said if we'd secret find ask
[1:11:15] his shall be given knock it shall be
[1:11:16] opened every words true and when Jacob
[1:11:20] got a hold of something that he could
[1:11:21] look at it hold - with his hands and
[1:11:23] seeing that that he was God he would not
[1:11:25] turn it loose who always Christendom
[1:11:30] could do that if you can lay your health
[1:11:33] your hand ahold of something that's real
[1:11:35] catch a vision of God see his presence
[1:11:38] and hold on to it until God since the
[1:11:40] answer back and the blessing letter of
[1:11:43] Ivor would break out here in Tulsa what
[1:11:46] about tonight in Elgin if you grab ahold
[1:11:49] something and you catch a vision and you
[1:11:52] know that you got a hold of something
[1:11:54] they ain't gonna let you go cuz it ain't
[1:11:56] you hope known anyway it's him holding
[1:11:58] on that angel ain't left us in 1965 that
[1:12:02] angels still standing here that angels

[1:13:33] you talk back to him hallelujah that
[1:13:38] same God that formed himself a body out
[1:13:41] of the calcium in the pod Hass in the
[1:13:43] dust of the earth and he took that dust
[1:13:45] of the earth and he blew of that dust
[1:13:47] and he stepped into that body that's the
[1:13:49] same God he wants to step into your
[1:13:50] children's body sister su he's wanting
[1:13:53] to take complete control over your life
[1:13:55] and show that he's God
[1:13:58] hallelujah it was not enough for him to
[1:14:00] show himself his dog through Jesus but
[1:14:02] now he is now walking through a body
[1:14:04] he's wanting to show himself as healer
[1:14:06] through a body he's wanting to show
[1:14:09] himself as a lover who a body he's
[1:14:11] wanting to show himself as a savior who
[1:14:13] a body I don't know about you but I like
[1:14:17] declaring that God still god I met him
[1:14:20] one time I met him one time and he got
[1:14:23] ahold of me and he never let go a little
[1:14:27] who you I remember that old man brother
[1:14:30] Vernon he's dead and stinking he's done
[1:14:33] in the grave done erotic many many years
[1:14:35] ago but every once in a while Oh
[1:14:39] slewfoot wants to raise him back up and
[1:14:41] say hey he's still here and all of a
[1:14:44] sudden the Holy Ghost says hey he ain't
[1:14:46] here no more I may look the same I may
[1:14:53] even walk the same but I do not live the
[1:14:56] same hallelujah because I was introduced
[1:15:00] to a God of her militance whoo hello
[1:15:06] it's the same God that was in a pillar
[1:15:09] fire that was same God in the whirlwind
[1:15:12] that's the same God in wrestling match
[1:15:16] Jesus said act that day you should know
[1:15:19] that I'm in the father and the father of
[1:15:21] me and I and you and you and me Church
[1:15:24] of the Living God your predestinated to
[1:15:26] win hallelujah he was of the first race
[1:15:31] he set this course in action but you are
[1:15:34] a church of a super race there's a whole
[1:15:37] lot of talk about racism kinds of
[1:15:40] different things going on in the world
[1:15:41] but there's a race setting here tonight
[1:15:44] that will never cease to exist when
[1:15:46] there is no more world the people of God
[1:15:49] the super race of God still will be it a
[1:15:52] black yellow green blue however color
[1:15:55] you want to be it's the god race whoo
[1:16:01] hallelujah
[1:16:03] it's this message that has brought us to
[1:16:05] a true Pentecostal experience brother
[1:16:08] BAM you remember when he said a parent
[1:16:09] he's after
[1:16:10] that morning and there was no Sun around
[1:16:12] there's no indifferent things and he saw
[1:16:14] those three rainbows as they were moving
[1:16:16] he said whatever it was it was living
[1:16:18] and it was three here are those three
[1:16:20] rainbows were standing there he said
[1:16:23] they were moving and the angel said
[1:16:24] that's close enough
[1:16:25] he said your home of the Old Testament
[1:16:28] it's Jesus Christ of the new and he was
[1:16:31] declaring that this was the message of
[1:16:33] him that is what William Branham
[1:16:35] preached to you and I that's what I'm
[1:16:37] preaching to you tonight it's the
[1:16:38] message of God whoo you see but I've I
[1:16:46] don't get you to a birth or if I don't
[1:16:47] get your children to a bar all this is
[1:16:50] is folklore all this is is history and
[1:16:52] all this isn't stories
[1:16:54] that's right anybody of your children
[1:16:56] pregnant sitting here long enough they
[1:16:57] could probably tell you about the
[1:16:59] 42-inch caribou they could tell you
[1:17:01] about the mountain they could tell you
[1:17:02] about how that grizzly bear wasn't
[1:17:03] showing up and Oh bud said hey brother
[1:17:05] it's about time that bears are showing
[1:17:07] up ain't it
[1:17:08] he said bud you're down you could
[1:17:10] probably quote that just like I just
[1:17:12] quoted that but if there is no birth on
[1:17:15] the inside of your soul all it is is a
[1:17:17] story but if you get what I'm talking
[1:17:20] about tonight when you die out to
[1:17:22] yourself it will be greater is He that
[1:17:27] is in you than he that is in the world I
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:34] know he's here I know he's real I know
[1:17:38] he's proven himself to be the same
[1:17:40] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:42] and if you don't get this baptism of the
[1:17:44] Holy Ghost you're going to disappoint
[1:17:45] yourself you'll let yourself down your
[1:17:48] tell yourself apart you'll say you're
[1:17:50] not going to make it and you won't make
[1:17:52] it cuz you ain't got it but get it one
[1:17:54] time get it one time you'll never he'll
[1:17:59] never disappoint you are you with me
[1:18:03] tonight if you are born again if you are
[1:18:08] born again you'll pull that God out of
[1:18:10] history and you'll show to a dying world
[1:18:11] that he's still living that he's still
[1:18:14] all-powerful that he's still omnipresent
[1:18:17] I've watched that god of deliverance
[1:18:19] firsthand Alleluia
[1:18:23] I seen him as weak I sent him this week
[1:18:26] to hallelujah but nine o'clock one night
[1:18:30] a certain individual from his church
[1:18:31] came stood on my porch and I watch the
[1:18:34] god of omnipotence show up and do the
[1:18:37] miraculous Wow
[1:18:39] it was odd wanted to show that he still
[1:18:42] god hallelujah
[1:18:49] now tonight if I tell you it's gonna be
[1:18:53] a death in this place
[1:18:55] some of y'all go running and screaming a
[1:18:57] holler all over this place get out the
[1:18:59] door said Oh God
[1:19:00] hope you talkin about me hope I am
[1:19:03] talking about some of you in your
[1:19:05] natural flesh of your spirit that you
[1:19:08] die out to yourself but if I would tell
[1:19:11] you that hey you're gonna die tonight
[1:19:13] whoa out of here she goes you're gonna
[1:19:17] go on the fly because you don't want to
[1:19:19] die it's something on the inside of a
[1:19:21] man but yet if I would tell you that on
[1:19:24] the other side of that death of the
[1:19:27] death of the old man that there is a new
[1:19:29] man standing there you'd run around this
[1:19:32] building shouting and screaming dancing
[1:19:35] all over this place if I tell you
[1:19:37] momma's and daddies that your children
[1:19:39] tonight there's going to be a death in
[1:19:41] here that the blood has been applied and
[1:19:44] the Death Angel has to pass over you go
[1:19:47] to screaming and shouting well you might
[1:19:49] as well go to scream in a shot
[1:19:51] God wouldn't put this hold me if I
[1:19:53] wasn't gonna be a death of an old man
[1:19:59] whoo hallelujah
[1:20:06] turn with me to galatians chapter 1 and
[1:20:08] three first quarter we're changing
[1:20:19] half's we're changing sides brother Jim
[1:20:22] brother Nathan you understand once a
[1:20:24] first quarter or changing sides
[1:20:29] somebody gotta say something you never
[1:20:31] get it that's okay
[1:20:32] I'll preach to those two get it let's
[1:20:37] just change directions just from home
[1:20:39] but great speak to you and peace from
[1:20:42] God the Father for my Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:45] who gave himself for our sins that he
[1:20:49] might deliver us from this present evil
[1:20:53] world according to the will of God and a
[1:20:57] father to whom be glory for ever and
[1:21:00] every man a notice that word and verse
[1:21:03] for that he might deliver us from this
[1:21:06] present evil world now that word in the
[1:21:09] Greek exclusive it means to properly
[1:21:11] means to pluck out it means to tear out
[1:21:15] or it means to take out from a number or
[1:21:17] to select then to rescue or to deliver
[1:21:21] now that does not mean that he is
[1:21:23] plucking you out by the way of death it
[1:21:26] does not mean that he is removing you to
[1:21:28] another world but it means that he might
[1:21:30] rescue you from this present world I can
[1:21:34] tell you sometimes this present world
[1:21:36] that we live in
[1:21:37] down here in Laodicea I sure am happy
[1:21:39] for him to pluck me out of it and
[1:21:41] separate me from the things of the chaos
[1:21:44] of this world when you go to looking at
[1:21:46] the news and looking at Fox News and CNN
[1:21:48] and Facebook and everybody else this
[1:21:50] means that they've created and they're
[1:21:52] gifs that they created I can tell you
[1:21:54] ain't one of them good or ain't none of
[1:21:56] them put rapture rapture face down on
[1:21:58] the inside of my soul but I take a look
[1:22:00] over here at the one that delivers us
[1:22:02] from this present world I have to get a
[1:22:06] little bit happy and it makes my faith
[1:22:08] sore a little bit to think one of these
[1:22:11] things he's not just going to remove me
[1:22:14] or rescue me from here from Laodicea
[1:22:16] into a place of heavenly position but
[1:22:19] he's going to take me out of this whole
[1:22:21] world he's going to change this or more
[1:22:24] body body now notice what this this day
[1:22:28] the scripture is fulfilled he's brother
[1:22:30] Branham said now I might to stop here if
[1:22:33] I had time to give you just a little tip
[1:22:35] sometimes you you may be sitting out
[1:22:38] there with cancer you might be sitting
[1:22:39] out there with a disease
[1:22:41] you think well why me why me being a
[1:22:44] Christian wouldn't would be in this this
[1:22:46] away why would I be sitting like this if
[1:22:49] I'm a Christian
[1:22:50] you could be truthful you ain't gotta
[1:22:52] raise their hand but I'm sure there's
[1:22:53] some times in your life when you're
[1:22:55] going through things you said why me I'm
[1:22:57] supposed to be a Christian I died out to
[1:22:58] myself but all of these Saints keep
[1:23:00] adding to me that's pretty
[1:23:02] understandable question but notice what
[1:23:05] the Prophet says he said sometimes God
[1:23:08] lets things get so dark that you can't
[1:23:11] see up around or anywhere else and then
[1:23:16] he comes and makes a way through it for
[1:23:18] you that you might say this day this
[1:23:23] scripture is fulfilled that he promised
[1:23:29] there are times in your life when you
[1:23:32] think why nice in the promise that I was
[1:23:35] promised
[1:23:36] but God sometimes allows things to
[1:23:39] happen to show forth that he is the God
[1:23:43] of omnipotence God's not the one that
[1:23:46] makes you sick
[1:23:47] and God's not going to make you ever
[1:23:49] flat tire but God allows things to
[1:23:52] happen in your life to develop character
[1:23:54] in your life because it's not overcoming
[1:23:58] power if he puts you on the inside of
[1:24:01] the pipe and pushes you through it is
[1:24:04] that right but if you kick scream crow
[1:24:09] holler jump and shout and you overcome
[1:24:13] by the blood of the Lamb and the word of
[1:24:15] your testimony
[1:24:16] that's overcoming when I didn't see when
[1:24:21] it was coming I still believed it was
[1:24:23] coming when they didn't look or when it
[1:24:26] didn't feel or when I didn't feel the
[1:24:28] anointing I still held on to the promise
[1:24:31] I won't tell you Church the words on
[1:24:37] your side the word is on your side and
[1:24:40] the word will always be there and Elijah
[1:24:44] knew that the word was on his side and
[1:24:46] he knew where he was standing at and he
[1:24:48] knew that he could trust God you
[1:24:51] I lost his faith was not in the mantle
[1:24:54] his faith was in the God of Elijah and
[1:24:59] he stood there and he said will be that
[1:25:02] God will not jack
[1:25:03] I know this is a little bit of a
[1:25:06] challenge and it's a challenge to your
[1:25:08] faith but these things I'm presenting to
[1:25:11] you is to make your faith rise higher
[1:25:14] what kind of man of God would I be if I
[1:25:17] did not challenge your faith to reach
[1:25:20] out and touch the impossible it's not
[1:25:23] faith if you can just reach out there
[1:25:26] see it walk right into it and now all of
[1:25:29] it be done it said that's not faith
[1:25:31] you're just doing your doing you see it
[1:25:33] it's just like going to Walmart you go
[1:25:36] over and you see the Clorox stand and
[1:25:37] then you grab the Clorox
[1:25:38] but refrain no Clorox ey're you can say
[1:25:41] lord I need to clean my house then all
[1:25:46] of a sudden a worker comes up in a blue
[1:25:48] apron hey you look for some Clorox I'd
[1:25:51] say that you had touched somebody we're
[1:25:57] in the season of Clorox it's ok you
[1:25:59] understand now notice he said now no
[1:26:02] notice but listen there is where faith
[1:26:04] takes its resting place for it knows for
[1:26:09] it knows that God will never never let
[1:26:13] the enemy right over the top of him I
[1:26:16] notice this whole walk of you with
[1:26:20] Christ is not about you you're not the
[1:26:23] big guy in the picture let me bring it
[1:26:26] down a little bit closer and look past
[1:26:28] what you're seeing
[1:26:29] it's not about brother on I don't take
[1:26:37] yourself a big cup grab ahold of it
[1:26:40] swallow it down it's good it'll help you
[1:26:44] this fight is not about brother on this
[1:26:48] is God's fight oh if you could ever
[1:26:55] realize hurts if you can look past this
[1:26:58] flesh look past what you see Oh
[1:27:03] that's what Hale is trying to keep you
[1:27:05] from Full Gospel Light House this ain't
[1:27:07] about Full Gospel Light House this ain't
[1:27:09] about brother on this is about God
[1:27:11] getting the glory and what will God do
[1:27:16] he will get just that but you get so
[1:27:24] attached it's easy it's my dad it's my
[1:27:27] pastor oh yeah it's easy but you gotta
[1:27:29] look past you got a little past now I
[1:27:33] know but there's a door on the other
[1:27:35] side of that bush
[1:27:36] I know that but sometimes you gotta walk
[1:27:42] around on the other side of that bush

[1:27:47] that burning bush was that God speaking
[1:27:49] to Moses are you with me

[1:28:52] that pharmacy oil that you spray on your

[1:29:19] you tell your neighbor you can't shake
[1:29:21] the hands you can't slap them but look

[1:29:33] your pharmacist we'll figure out what's
[1:29:35] going on we're not gonna get nowhere now
[1:29:43] this is what help me Lord this is where
[1:29:49] let me start all over this is where
[1:29:51] faith takes its resting place for it
[1:29:53] knows that God would never let the enemy
[1:29:55] ride over top of him he never has faith
[1:29:59] knows that so regardless of what the
[1:30:02] thing looked no one knew that the ark
[1:30:05] could float Daniel knew that God could
[1:30:08] close the Mawlid lion's mouth the Hebrew
[1:30:10] children knew that God could stop the
[1:30:13] fire and jesus knew that God would raise
[1:30:15] him up again because the Lord said I'll
[1:30:18] not leave his soul in Hell neither will
[1:30:21] I suffer my Holy One to see corruption
[1:30:23] are you with me and I know how about you
[1:30:27] brother Jordan that it's not going to be
[1:30:29] about you but God is going to raise up
[1:30:31] your body are you with me I know what he
[1:30:35] said about this body I'm not talking
[1:30:38] about this body I'm talking about the
[1:30:40] body of Christ that is going to rise
[1:30:41] above creats rise above denominations
[1:30:44] rise above doubts rise above sin rise
[1:30:47] above the grave rise above your fears
[1:30:52] hallelujah lots of the war who had the
[1:30:57] double portion
[1:30:58] he stood down there said where is the
[1:31:00] god of Elijah and let the God that wrote
[1:31:03] the word confirm the word if this is his
[1:31:06] word let him stand by he promised to do
[1:31:08] it he'll do it if we'll believe it I can
[1:31:15] tell you most of you sitting here are
[1:31:18] mature Christians been sitting here
[1:31:19] probably got their agrees in this
[1:31:21] message and you know that prayer changes
[1:31:24] things
[1:31:25] but prayer seems to be the thing that
[1:31:28] slacks the most in most people's life we
[1:31:32] can be honest dumbest some of you go to
[1:31:34] prayer and you go to praying at night
[1:31:36] I'm explaining human life right now but
[1:31:38] you go to pray in the night time and all
[1:31:40] of a sudden all of a sudden I heaviness
[1:31:42] comes over top of you and you're laying
[1:31:44] before the Lord has closed and you're
[1:31:46] knocked out prayers sure they changed
[1:31:53] some things
[1:31:53] you went from a wake to sleep in 0.02
[1:31:56] seconds but we realized that prayer is
[1:32:00] the most powerful weapon that is ever
[1:32:03] placed in the hands of you and I now it
[1:32:07] is not the length of the prayer it is
[1:32:09] not how deep you go in your voice or how
[1:32:13] high you go in your voice but when it
[1:32:15] comes from the heart that's when all of
[1:32:18] a sudden God goes - moving on the scene
[1:32:21] and all of a sudden the omnipotent God
[1:32:23] that you thought was so far away all of
[1:32:25] a sudden comes down in your car and all
[1:32:28] of a sudden you watch things start
[1:32:30] taking place in your life because of the
[1:32:36] communication between you and the divine
[1:32:40] being of God you have grabbed ahold of a
[1:32:44] line and it's like you're pulling guard
[1:32:48] down to you but what it is it's God
[1:32:50] pulling you up to him prayer does not
[1:32:55] bring God down to you but it takes you
[1:32:58] to his level and when you are in that
[1:33:00] spirit of prayer I'm not just talking
[1:33:03] about when you start praying and asking
[1:33:04] God to bless the parakeet's and bless
[1:33:07] your little little lamb out there bless
[1:33:09] your chickens and give you more than
[1:33:10] seven eggs a day I'm talking about when
[1:33:13] you go into the spirit of prayer and you
[1:33:15] start having a breakthrough and all of a
[1:33:17] sudden everything around you begins to
[1:33:19] get life and ever all the one of your
[1:33:21] burdens seem to just shield off for you
[1:33:26] you're standing there and the Prophet
[1:33:29] said that when you drew it truly and
[1:33:31] really pray through everything around
[1:33:34] you
[1:33:36] I wonder if we hit that spot this week
[1:33:43] it's okay you can have that spot
[1:33:48] if you ain't had it in a while I want to
[1:33:51] tell you can have it you can get in such
[1:33:54] a spirit of Prayer and the atmosphere
[1:33:57] change your family changes your attitude
[1:34:01] changes your job changes your boss
[1:34:04] changes your needs change you go from
[1:34:09] praying about yourself
[1:34:10] to praying about your brother praying
[1:34:12] about the preacher praying about this
[1:34:14] and God starts taking those things now
[1:34:19] if we could bottle up the things that we
[1:34:20] prayed for God comes over and he feels
[1:34:24] it up with his life and you watch you go
[1:34:29] pray for one of your lost loved ones and
[1:34:31] I mean full out pray and it don't look
[1:34:35] like they're coming whatsoever and all
[1:34:39] of a sudden just God goes to doing
[1:34:42] something because you prayed do you know
[1:34:46] the half of this church is filled up
[1:34:48] because of prayer I'm talking about our
[1:34:52] full congregation right now that most of
[1:34:54] you that are here are here by the way a
[1:34:56] prayer Dwight Moody said that every
[1:35:00] great move of God you can look behind it
[1:35:03] and you see a kneeling figure what is it
[1:35:06] it is prayer that brings God on the
[1:35:09] scene I walked out Monday morning after
[1:35:12] preaching to you for the last cup of
[1:35:14] services are introducing a God of our
[1:35:17] militants I walked out in such an
[1:35:20] atmosphere in my home and God just
[1:35:22] seemed to speak to my heart invoke me
[1:35:26] invoke me invoke of the God of
[1:35:30] omnipotence if you could realize who me
[1:35:33] who's on the other side of the line it
[1:35:36] is not the China ambassador but it's the
[1:35:39] creator of heaven and earth and if you
[1:35:41] would go to invoking and appealing to
[1:35:43] the higher authority what would take
[1:35:47] place
[1:35:48] are you with me you remember Loa Jemima
[1:35:52] down there down there in a spot that
[1:35:54] that nobody wanted to go to when there
[1:35:57] was down there in the Sandy's and she
[1:35:59] had prayed a prayer of faith and there
[1:36:02] was a 747 that was flying over the
[1:36:05] atmosphere and inside of that 747 was
[1:36:09] the answer but all of a sudden it
[1:36:12] disrupted everybody's plans on the rest
[1:36:14] of that plane but it brought the god of
[1:36:17] Elijah on the scene for her oh and about
[1:36:22] four o'clock in the morning Haeju mommy
[1:36:25] was woke up by a dream that there was a
[1:36:28] man coming had a brown suit on and a
[1:36:31] brown hat on and she seen that it had a
[1:36:34] briefcase and here brother madam come
[1:36:36] walking down that Street singing that
[1:36:38] old Pentecostal song I'm one of them I'm
[1:36:42] one of them well I'm so glad that I
[1:36:44] could say I'm one of them and he's going
[1:36:47] down through here and it looks over said
[1:36:50] morning morning and she says morning
[1:36:53] parson how'd you know I suppose she said
[1:36:56] eyes have been up early in the morning
[1:36:58] I've been up early this morning and the
[1:37:00] Lord told me use coming the only thing I
[1:37:02] don't recognize about you is where's
[1:37:04] your briefcase she said he said it's
[1:37:07] back in the hotel he recognized that
[1:37:10] she'd been talking to the omnipotent God
[1:37:12] she said you ever read about that Sunnah
[1:37:15] my woman I'll be like that shooter my
[1:37:17] woman
[1:37:18] but where be my Elisha my brother Joseph
[1:37:22] Lee pointed this out to me years ago now
[1:37:24] she couldn't afraid that prayer 200
[1:37:26] years ago but she was praying it in the
[1:37:29] right day because there was an Elijah
[1:37:33] that could come on the scene for the
[1:37:35] Shuler my woman and we know what took
[1:37:39] place what was it it was the power of
[1:37:42] prayer now that's some faith that'll
[1:37:46] stop a 747 what about if you would go to
[1:37:51] prayer like never before
[1:37:53] this woman's prayer disrupted everybody
[1:37:56] else's plans what if you go to pray what
[1:38:00] if you don't appeal into
[1:38:01] the higher authority and invoking the
[1:38:03] God of heaven it would disrupt the
[1:38:05] devil's plans he's got plans to kill you
[1:38:09] but if you've got to call it on God God
[1:38:11] will show up Alleluia
[1:38:15] what am I telling you about the God that
[1:38:19] is on your side what's too hard for this
[1:38:29] God what's too little okay because every
[1:38:40] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:38:45] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:38:47] every headaches got about the biggest
[1:38:52] demon inhales got a bath Satan himself
[1:38:55] is gallabat Bala lujah your prada khals
[1:38:59] will have two baths
[1:39:00] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:05] but the musicians come Fallon oh whoa
[1:39:13] what would happen in huh what would
[1:39:17] happen enough you would break through if
[1:39:23] you would break through sad just what
[1:39:30] God's will for my life that's what I
[1:39:32] want that's what every Christian wants
[1:39:34] that's what you wanted to average out of
[1:39:38] gods as Harris for the will of God he
[1:39:43] has lined out every one of his promises
[1:39:48] for you I am the lord that heals all of
[1:39:57] your diseases
[1:39:59] the days of miracles are not past
[1:40:01] children the days of promises are not
[1:40:05] past for somebody to say that it's not
[1:40:10] God's will to heal that it's not God's
[1:40:12] will to perform here of course that it's
[1:40:14] not God's will to save what are they
[1:40:16] doing they're changing the God of the
[1:40:20] Bible but my prophet said my prophet
[1:40:24] messenger stood here and thoroughly
[1:40:27] vindicated that the god of omnipotence
[1:40:32] he's here he's right here he's right
[1:40:38] here now we know that that world
[1:40:43] spinning faster than this one and we
[1:40:44] can't really see what's going on in that
[1:40:46] world brother ray but we know that it's
[1:40:48] there is that right we know that there's
[1:40:52] angels that are gathered here tonight
[1:40:53] sister Karli better they're there to
[1:40:55] watch over us that are there to take
[1:40:57] care of us you don't see them but yet
[1:41:00] there are angels that are here and
[1:41:03] moving and moving the body but it's got
[1:41:06] to come through the body that germ that
[1:41:10] God is trying to get to you has got to
[1:41:12] come through the body but those angels
[1:41:17] are here and also their fallen angels
[1:41:21] that are here and you walked brother BAM
[1:41:25] could look into that world and he could
[1:41:27] see those things and he would you could
[1:41:30] hear him on tape say now now he tell
[1:41:32] these sayings that he'd seen now there
[1:41:34] was a dark spirit that came and got that
[1:41:36] man and took him to the restroom and he
[1:41:38] missed his door of opportunity what was
[1:41:41] it it was a fallen angel that was
[1:41:44] directing what he wanted to make a claim
[1:41:47] on the body now if that world has that
[1:41:51] much power to influence this fleshly Ram
[1:41:54] what about the God that is on my side
[1:41:58] hello if he's got that much power he
[1:42:03] could control these 16 elements
[1:42:07] it's not God's will for you to be sick
[1:42:09] and it's not God's will for you to think
[1:42:12] bad thoughts but he is the God of
[1:42:16] omnipotence that wants to take control
[1:42:19] over your body your spirit and your soul
[1:42:23] let's stand Oh Helen Oh
[1:42:31] aw let's pray children father we've we
[1:42:36] come tonight we come tonight calling on
[1:42:41] the name of Jesus we realize that
[1:42:48] that there is no power in heaven and
[1:42:53] earth given among men whereby they must
[1:42:56] be saved but by the way of Jesus we
[1:43:00] realize if that power is ever present
[1:43:04] here moving and changing lives by the
[1:43:09] word of prophecy
[1:43:13] the anointing of this hour as it goes
[1:43:17] out and gets the steward cause him to
[1:43:20] come up a little bit higher
[1:43:23] now Lord I've watched you tonight as you
[1:43:26] begin to deal with farts and begin to
[1:43:28] move on certain needs and I'm aware of
[1:43:31] God I can hide I can try to look at
[1:43:35] things and trial to try to make a idea
[1:43:39] or a good stance to understand how you
[1:43:43] do things through service but when you
[1:43:46] come and totally rearrange and change
[1:43:49] thoughts to go after one need I realize
[1:43:54] that
[1:43:55] I realize that you're after
[1:43:58] chilli
[1:44:00] and the words of PMS is more than a
[1:44:05] man's words but the words of them is to
[1:44:08] look past what they see look past what
[1:44:11] they feel for Jesus your ever praise me
[1:44:17] more Jesus and these things that ever
[1:44:19] been presented to us they're not history
[1:44:24] but here

[1:44:48] God that you see the desire that they're
[1:44:50] releasing from their heart to Stan
[1:44:53] I pray Lord Jesus that you take complete
[1:45:00] control and that you adorn yourself pour
[1:45:04] yourself into that situation
[1:45:09] or to me was to invoke the part of
[1:45:15] omnipotence the father
