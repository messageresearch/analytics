[51:09] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen
[51:13] if you have your Bibles this evening
[51:14] we'd like to look over in the New
[51:16] Testament in a few places in John
[51:19] chapter 4 and then down to Hebrews 11
[51:22] and then Romans chapter 8
[51:27] . I know it's a few different readings
[51:29] for you from flipping back and forth but
[51:30] I want to gather these these texts to
[51:34] gather our thoughts tonight I would like
[51:36] to speak to you on this thought of lead
[51:40] led by the pillar of Fire
[51:42] led by the pillar of fire and it good to
[51:45] be in the house of the Lord amen amen we
[51:49] love the Lord of all of our hearts amen
[51:51] we counter the privilege to be in his
[51:53] house one more time amen God is so good
[51:56] to us
[51:57] amen John chapter 4 and verse 6 and
[52:01] Jesus saith unto him I am the way the
[52:05] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[52:09] the father
[52:10] but by me amen Hebrews chapter 11 and
[52:14] verse 24.
[52:28] by faith Moses when he was come to years
[52:31] refused to be called the son of
[52:33] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[52:36] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[52:38] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[52:40] season
[52:41] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[52:44] riches than the treasures in Egypt for
[52:47] he had respect under the recompense of
[52:49] the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[52:53] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[52:55] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[52:59] in Romans chapter 8 and verse 11
[53:07] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[53:10] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[53:13] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[53:15] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[53:18] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[53:19] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[53:22] the flesh to live after the flesh for if
[53:26] you live after the flesh you shall die
[53:28] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[53:30] the Deeds of the body you shall live for
[53:33] as many as are led by the spirit of God
[53:36] they are the sons of God may God bless
[53:39] his word he may be seated in the
[53:41] presence of the Lord as we said we'd
[53:43] like to speak to you on this thought of
[53:45] lead by the pillar of fire brother
[53:47] Branham said in the message of led by
[53:49] the spirit he said the greatest the
[53:51] greatest thing that I found in Christian
[53:52] Life is letting the Holy Spirit lead you
[53:56] and guide you the greatest thing that
[53:58] I've found in Christian Life is letting
[54:00] the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[54:02] he said there's no one that can lead you
[54:04] to the altar but the spirit of God
[54:06] there's no one that could bring you here
[54:08] tonight lest it was a spirit of God he
[54:11] moves in mysterious ways and is one
[54:13] vendors are to perform and to think that
[54:16] our Prophet would stand here before us
[54:18] in this generation recognizing some of
[54:21] the greatest things being able to see
[54:23] some of the greatest Mysteries and
[54:25] understand some of the greatest things
[54:26] that that had been hid before the
[54:28] foundation of the world and to see and
[54:30] recognize that the greatest thing that
[54:32] that the prophet could find was to be
[54:35] led by the very Spirit of the Living God
[54:37] and I have to think have to have to
[54:39] agree with William Branham here on this
[54:41] thought it's the greatest thing in life
[54:42] to recognize the leadership of the Lord
[54:45] Jesus Christ and it's a very incredible
[54:47] thought when you begin to think about
[54:49] your own life in its own Spectrum when
[54:51] you begin to think about the creator of
[54:53] Heaven and Earth is the one that that
[54:55] has been leading you through all of your
[54:57] times of life in in good times and in
[54:59] bad times and David would say in Psalms
[55:02] 34 that I Will Bless The Lord at all
[55:04] times but to recognize that our Lord
[55:07] Jesus Christ has been the one that has
[55:09] led you through every journey through
[55:11] every struggle through every battle it
[55:13] was Spirit of the Living God that was
[55:15] there that was leading you leading you
[55:17] through cancer leading you through
[55:19] trials leading you through marriage
[55:21] problems leading you through financial
[55:23] issues in your life it was the spirit of
[55:25] the Living God that was leading you
[55:27] through all of those things and to
[55:28] recognize that his leadership has been
[55:31] there all of those days but not just in
[55:33] the natural but to recognize that the
[55:35] spirit of the Living God has led you in
[55:37] all of your spiritual life that he that
[55:39] he that he led you he maybe he may have
[55:41] alleged you down to this church and you
[55:43] may you may have found or gave your
[55:44] heart to the Lord maybe in a Catholic
[55:46] church or down at a church of Christ but
[55:48] it's the grace of God that he didn't
[55:50] leave you down there in those dead
[55:52] denominations but he but he led you to
[55:54] something that would bring you rapturing
[55:56] faith in this generation and I thank the
[55:59] Lord that he didn't leave us where he
[56:00] found us but he led us to a rock that
[56:02] was higher than our ourselves and to
[56:05] recognize that that our living God that
[56:07] is that is present right here in the
[56:09] Church of the Living God right now is
[56:12] here to lead you through every
[56:13] circumstance through through every trial
[56:16] of life through every little detail and
[56:18] we recognize that God took a picture of
[56:20] us before the foundation of the world
[56:22] and and we recognize that brother
[56:24] Brandon would tell us that God took that
[56:26] picture of us when we were at our best
[56:28] now a lot of times if we would get it in
[56:31] our own human capacity to be able to
[56:33] look at our what we think of us as our
[56:35] best we would think of us after we've
[56:38] won the Victory and we're carrying on
[56:39] the Triumph enjoying the spoils of
[56:42] Victory or or maybe it's when we're not
[56:44] maybe we would think about ourselves of
[56:46] being our at our best is when we when we
[56:48] don't have problems going on or when
[56:50] things are not going when things are
[56:52] going according to what we would say
[56:54] when things are peachy as we would say
[56:56] but God doesn't look like we look we
[56:59] look into the human eye but God is
[57:01] looking through the Eternal eye of
[57:03] almighty God and he's looking at us in
[57:05] our best and I recognize and we
[57:07] recognize that that man a man isn't man
[57:10] isn't always God didn't take that
[57:13] picture of us when we were in our lowest
[57:15] he didn't take that picture of us when
[57:17] we were at a horse but he took that
[57:19] picture of us when we were at our best
[57:21] and there though there are things in our
[57:24] life that have come against us that have
[57:26] made us better people their struggles in
[57:28] our life that has came against us
[57:29] calamities and storms and trials that
[57:32] have made us a better people and we
[57:34] would think that we were at our worst
[57:36] moments right there but it's in our
[57:38] worst moments that the best is brought
[57:40] out of us you see it's our trials that
[57:43] are more precious than gold that make us
[57:45] make us rich in our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:48] and it's not necessarily the good times
[57:50] that God makes us the best that we are
[57:52] it's in the worst of Trials and in the
[57:55] worst of and the worst of our
[57:56] circumstances where God shows up and he
[57:59] shows out and we recognize that he was
[58:02] the one that was carrying us when we
[58:04] looked like back on the beaches of the
[58:05] sands of time and we thought that we
[58:07] were all alone it was a time that he was
[58:10] carrying us when we thought we'd never
[58:12] make it when our friends left us when
[58:14] our family left us he was there all the
[58:16] time and I think it's a wonderful thing
[58:18] tonight to know that he said I'll never
[58:20] leave you and I'll never forsake you and
[58:23] to think that tonight that he's been the
[58:24] one that was leading you through your
[58:26] move and leading you through your jobs
[58:28] and leading these through your spiritual
[58:30] life and he said I'll be there with you
[58:33] even in you till the end of the world
[58:35] you see if I want to see you at your
[58:37] best I don't look at you when you ain't
[58:39] got troubles but I look at you when
[58:41] you're in the midst of your troubles
[58:43] because when you are in the midst of
[58:45] your trials it brings out the real you
[58:47] you'll find out who you really are
[58:49] you'll find out if you're really a real
[58:51] Christian if you if you if you're down
[58:53] and you bare Knuckles and you and you're
[58:55] digging your way out of the ditches
[58:56] you'll find out if you really got the
[58:58] goods or not if you're in the midst of a
[59:01] trial that's where God wants to find you
[59:03] now to me now to me now Jesus was good
[59:06] when he healed the Widow and Lanes it
[59:08] need a widow of main sun and it raised
[59:10] him up when they were tearing him out on
[59:11] a coffin to me Jesus was good when he
[59:14] walked out there and he healed Lazarus
[59:16] and brought him back from the dead to me
[59:18] Jesus was really good when he walked out
[59:20] there on the waters and he called the
[59:22] Seas and he told them not to fear I am
[59:25] the one that will calm your troubles add
[59:27] to me Jesus was good when he walked out
[59:30] there and he healed the lepers to me
[59:32] Jesus was good when he fed the five
[59:34] thousand to me Jesus was good when he
[59:37] turned the water into wine but to me
[59:39] when I look at Jesus when Jesus was at
[59:41] his best is when Jesus was coming up now
[59:44] goth is here and he was tearing a cross
[59:46] and it was more than just a wooden cross
[59:49] he was carrying my sins he was carrying
[59:51] your sins if I want to see Jesus at his
[59:54] best I look at him at Calvary and he
[59:57] said oh Hallelujah it is finished
[1:00:00] you see Jesus wasn't his best at his
[1:00:03] birth he was at his best at his death
[1:00:08] you see there's something on the inside
[1:00:10] of you that is driving you or leading
[1:00:12] you to be at your best when you're in
[1:00:14] your worship moments and to think that
[1:00:17] he's had his hands on you
[1:00:19] the whole time
[1:00:21] to look back over the span of your life
[1:00:22] and to think that Jesus was there
[1:00:26] he gives great consolation to know when
[1:00:29] you're going through a battle Brother
[1:00:30] Ray that Jesus was there
[1:00:32] he gives us wonderful consolation and
[1:00:35] fear and fear can be rolled back because
[1:00:38] of faith when it Rose in recognizing
[1:00:41] that he's had you in his hands the whole
[1:00:43] time because you see if you can look
[1:00:46] back and see that Jesus had you then you
[1:00:48] can look back and look at right now and
[1:00:50] say Jesus has got me now and brother
[1:00:52] Madam would tell us in in different
[1:00:54] messages he said it was somebody that
[1:00:56] led you in your first step if you go
[1:00:58] back and study out the message
[1:00:59] leadership it'll bless you really it'll
[1:01:01] bless you really good but brother Byron
[1:01:03] would say that he said when you took
[1:01:04] your first step somebody had to leave
[1:01:06] you he was a mama that had to lead you
[1:01:08] or a daddy that was there or somebody
[1:01:10] had to leave you he said the very last
[1:01:12] step you take in this life it'll be
[1:01:14] somebody that'll lead you out he said
[1:01:16] but Jesus likened us undefeated he said
[1:01:19] sheep will go astray sheep will go
[1:01:21] wondering because we need a shepherd and
[1:01:24] you see the shepherd is going to lead us
[1:01:27] under Green Pastures he's going to lead
[1:01:29] us to where we're going to eat real
[1:01:31] sheep food and you find that if you
[1:01:33] start if you start being led over to
[1:01:36] something that ain't sheep food seed
[1:01:38] food if you're being led over there to
[1:01:39] eat on some hamburger or ground up beef
[1:01:42] you'll find that you've got a Shepherd
[1:01:43] that's trying to feed you something that
[1:01:46] isn't necessarily Seafood but there is a
[1:01:49] Shepherd that knows exactly what is a
[1:01:51] sheep's diet and he feeds them a seven
[1:01:53] course menu of Malachi 4 and it'll
[1:01:56] produce some body change in the body
[1:01:58] when when everybody else wants to lead
[1:02:00] them lead them to church or lead them to
[1:02:03] an idea this message leads you right
[1:02:06] back to our Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:02:09] didn't lead us to a man this didn't lead
[1:02:11] us to an idea but this led us to the one
[1:02:14] that paid the ultimate price for you and
[1:02:16] I
[1:02:18] foreign
[1:02:19] I'm so thankful to be led by a Shepherd
[1:02:22] that knows how to lead a sheep
[1:02:25] but are you going to listen in there and
[1:02:27] studying out that message oh on
[1:02:29] leadership that brother random goes in
[1:02:30] there and he deals he deals with a rich
[1:02:32] young ruler and he also deals he deals
[1:02:35] with two Rich Young rulers right there
[1:02:37] and I know you're very aware of these
[1:02:38] things because you've been taught to
[1:02:40] listen to the message but you recognize
[1:02:42] that bear brother random is diving into
[1:02:45] a man's life his life as a Rich Young
[1:02:47] Ruler he was a possessor of a lot of
[1:02:50] things he had a lot of riches he had a
[1:02:52] lot of he had a lot of things in life
[1:02:54] and but yet there was something in his
[1:02:57] life that he was lacking because you see
[1:02:59] you see he had he gained everything that
[1:03:01] he gained in this world he had gathered
[1:03:04] knowledge of how to be a good
[1:03:06] businessman he had respected the
[1:03:08] traditions of the law and he'd come to
[1:03:11] Jesus and he said unto him Master what
[1:03:14] good things shall I do that I may have
[1:03:16] eternal life and Jesus said well I call
[1:03:18] us thou me good he said there's none
[1:03:20] good but one that is but God if thou
[1:03:23] will enter into life keep his
[1:03:25] commandment and hear this Rich Young
[1:03:28] Ruler he began to ask him said now what
[1:03:30] about which Commandments are you asking
[1:03:31] me to to keep and he began to lay out
[1:03:34] the law of what what Moses had said
[1:03:36] there and he said well I've done all of
[1:03:37] those things but then he asked him he
[1:03:40] asked him or he told him he said if thou
[1:03:42] will be perfect go and sell all that you
[1:03:45] have
[1:03:46] and come and follow me but there brother
[1:03:49] random said that he went away sad he
[1:03:52] said because he was he had very great
[1:03:54] riches in his life you see he led those
[1:03:57] he let those riches lead him his life he
[1:04:00] let business re lead him in life but
[1:04:03] when it come to the Prince of Life
[1:04:05] he wouldn't let him lead him he had all
[1:04:08] the Traditions down but he wouldn't let
[1:04:09] the one that wrote the law lead him
[1:04:12] so he really wasn't living out the law
[1:04:14] anyway because the leader wasn't on the
[1:04:16] inside of him
[1:04:18] is that right
[1:04:21] but to think that he would deny the very
[1:04:23] leadership of almighty God
[1:04:29] to think that he would turn this down
[1:04:31] and when he because he had great riches
[1:04:34] you see if sedition was good enough for
[1:04:37] him if tradition or the letter was
[1:04:40] enough he would have never been at the
[1:04:42] feet of Jesus
[1:04:43] are you with me a lot of you come out of
[1:04:46] denominationalism but if it was enough
[1:04:48] you would have never been at the feet of
[1:04:49] this message you see legalism and
[1:04:52] intellectualism and denominationalism
[1:04:55] will never be enough to bring you under
[1:04:57] Perfection but the one that wrote the
[1:04:59] word that is the word is here to lead
[1:05:02] you
[1:05:04] well you can't make it work out where
[1:05:06] where you can't make it live every
[1:05:08] single one of you that were raised in
[1:05:10] this message you heard it from the from
[1:05:12] the time that you were in diapers and
[1:05:14] you could quote every quote you could
[1:05:16] tell almost every story but until the
[1:05:18] leader got there
[1:05:19] until the one that could talk to you and
[1:05:22] lead you out of trouble now he didn't
[1:05:24] just lead you into good things but he
[1:05:26] led you out of bad things
[1:05:28] I'm telling you right now the God that I
[1:05:30] serve is a god that'll lead you to
[1:05:32] blessings and he leads you right out of
[1:05:34] the devil's trap
[1:05:39] I'm gonna say this I know that there's
[1:05:41] some people that are still ensnared or
[1:05:43] trapped up but the leader of the Holy
[1:05:45] Ghost is here to lead you right out of
[1:05:47] the Trap of the devil
[1:05:49] yeah
[1:05:50] yeah
[1:05:52] you see this rich young man when he come
[1:05:54] down our Young Ruler all of his religion
[1:05:57] had belonged to the church and
[1:05:59] everything fine educated fine
[1:06:00] businessman and everything when he come
[1:06:02] to the end of the road he began to
[1:06:04] scream he began to scream there's
[1:06:06] nowhere for me to step he so where's his
[1:06:09] leadership he'd been led by his church
[1:06:11] which was dead he had been led up by a
[1:06:14] dead world and there was nothing for him
[1:06:17] to step into but what the world had
[1:06:20] prepared for it was hell that was the
[1:06:23] only place that he could be led to
[1:06:24] because the world and the life that he
[1:06:27] was living was leading him to
[1:06:29] destruction
[1:06:31] but here is another Rich Young Ruler
[1:06:33] that brother Brandon brings out and it's
[1:06:35] Moses that Moses was a rich young ruler
[1:06:38] and he forsook Egypt because he endured
[1:06:42] I seeing him who is invisible and to
[1:06:45] think to think that Moses had all of
[1:06:48] Egypt at his fingertips but the Bible
[1:06:51] said that he held out
[1:06:53] he endured I sing him who is invisible
[1:06:57] he had he had all of Egypt at his
[1:07:00] fingertips all he had to do was deny the
[1:07:03] vision that he had caught up there on
[1:07:05] that mountain and he could have went
[1:07:06] back to being Pharaoh but instead of
[1:07:09] being led by his own wants or being led
[1:07:11] by his own desires he was led by the
[1:07:14] vision or the Revelation that he taught
[1:07:16] a player at the experience of the
[1:07:18] burning bush
[1:07:20] thank you
[1:07:21] what was it he refused to be one with
[1:07:25] the people of each you see before the
[1:07:27] experience Moses was coward and he never
[1:07:30] felt spiritually he never felt
[1:07:32] spiritually fit to lead the great Army
[1:07:34] of people but was afterward he'd come in
[1:07:37] contact with the bush that fire that
[1:07:39] burnout that he endured as seeing him
[1:07:42] who is invisible you see he was better
[1:07:44] qualified for the job five minutes after
[1:07:47] he'd met the Lord in the burning bush
[1:07:49] with an experience you see you can never
[1:07:52] come in contact with almighty god
[1:07:54] without having an experience you see God
[1:07:57] has no grandchildren
[1:08:00] you see my little daughters have got to
[1:08:02] have the same experience that I had
[1:08:05] they've gotten to meet the same one that
[1:08:07] I met and if you expect to get out of
[1:08:10] this layout of cnh you're going to have
[1:08:12] to meet the one that wrote the Bible
[1:08:16] the one that showed up for Noah the one
[1:08:18] that showed up for Isaiah the one that
[1:08:21] showed up for Daniel when the Daniel was
[1:08:23] up there in a lion's den brother Madam
[1:08:25] said he was so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:27] that the Lions couldn't eat him I'll say
[1:08:30] that the Church of the Living God is so
[1:08:33] full of the Holy Ghost that layout of
[1:08:35] sea is going to have to just push us out
[1:08:37] of this whole world
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:40] what is it it's Jehovah that is leading
[1:08:43] us
[1:08:46] he come in contact with him for five
[1:08:48] minutes and he was better equipped than
[1:08:51] all of his 80 years
[1:08:56] to think he had somewhere that he could
[1:08:59] put his foot down
[1:09:03] you ever wondered you ever wondered
[1:09:05] through life and felt like you could
[1:09:07] never get a foothold
[1:09:08] but David said Lord increase my
[1:09:12] footsteps that I'll have a large place
[1:09:15] to land at
[1:09:16] you see you've got to have a place that
[1:09:19] you can land that and David would say in
[1:09:21] Psalm 61 that when I am overwhelmed Lord
[1:09:25] lead me to a rock that is higher than I
[1:09:28] when I can't get through it when I can't
[1:09:31] get over it when I can't get under it
[1:09:33] lead me to the Rock lead me when I'm
[1:09:36] into searching when I'm in depression
[1:09:38] when I'm in exams anxiety Lead Me To The
[1:09:42] Rock
[1:09:46] this was two Rich Young rulers one took
[1:09:50] the way of Destruction but one he took
[1:09:53] the reproach of Christ he refused Egypt
[1:09:57] and he took on the reproach of Christ he
[1:09:59] esteemed it greater than the riches of
[1:10:01] down there in Egypt
[1:10:03] but I wonder today if we esteemed the
[1:10:06] reproach of Christ greater than the
[1:10:09] riches of laodicea I wonder if we I
[1:10:12] wonder if we would refuse if God
[1:10:15] commanded us to do such and such and to
[1:10:18] turn down lay on us here I wonder if we
[1:10:21] would esteem him greater
[1:10:23] I wonder if we turn down everything if
[1:10:26] we turn down business if we turn down if
[1:10:29] we turn down everything that laodicea
[1:10:31] had to offer us
[1:10:33] because of Christ
[1:10:35] if you won't turn down anything if you
[1:10:38] won't turn down everything then it shows
[1:10:40] Who Your Leader is
[1:10:44] are you with me if you can't turn down
[1:10:47] what the world offers it shows you that
[1:10:49] there's another spirit that is leading
[1:10:52] you I want somebody that'll lead me to a
[1:10:55] revelation that's greater than myself I
[1:10:58] want somebody that'll lead me to a rock
[1:11:01] that is higher than my problems higher
[1:11:03] than my situation higher than cancer
[1:11:06] higher than anxiety higher than blood
[1:11:08] pressure I ain't just talking about
[1:11:10] natural things but I want somebody that
[1:11:13] can lead me
[1:11:18] lead me when I feel like nobody loves me
[1:11:21] lead me when I feel like nobody's for me
[1:11:24] lead me when every devil in Hell's got
[1:11:27] his gun trained against me I want
[1:11:29] somebody that'll Lead Me
[1:11:32] when friends forsake you when mothers
[1:11:34] leave you and fathers walk away from you
[1:11:37] I want somebody that'll lead me through
[1:11:39] life
[1:11:48] ask yourself
[1:11:50] would you rather give up your wife or
[1:11:52] would you rather give up your Christ
[1:11:56] if you can give up Jesus
[1:11:59] before you can give up your family
[1:12:00] members you've got something wrong in
[1:12:02] your life
[1:12:04] if you can give up Jesus before you can
[1:12:07] give up your job there's something else
[1:12:09] that's leading you
[1:12:11] but if you can give up your job if you
[1:12:14] can give up your family if you can give
[1:12:16] up your health if you can give up your
[1:12:18] wealth for Jesus Jesus will lead you
[1:12:25] I'm gonna tell you right now there's
[1:12:27] nowhere that God will lead you that the
[1:12:29] grace of God can keep you
[1:12:32] he will be there for the thick and thin
[1:12:34] he will be there whenever when the
[1:12:37] groceries are ran out when the money has
[1:12:39] come dry and the oil is spent and the
[1:12:42] meal is gone he's still the god of
[1:12:45] Elijah
[1:12:50] who let Elijah up there anyway
[1:12:53] who made those Ravens stop feeding him
[1:12:57] somebody was leading those Ravens and
[1:13:00] somebody was leading the prophet to go
[1:13:02] by a suit of my Woman's Place
[1:13:04] come on somebody who was the one that
[1:13:07] led Elijah by your way when the church
[1:13:10] World disowned him when they said they
[1:13:12] didn't want nothing to do with him who
[1:13:14] let Elijah by your way because you have
[1:13:17] been anointed by accepting this message
[1:13:19] it was almighty God that led Elijah by
[1:13:22] your way
[1:13:26] foreign
[1:13:27] behold I send you
[1:13:29] Elijah
[1:13:33] who let Malachi 4 by your way
[1:13:38] I'll say it's the same one that led the
[1:13:40] children of Israel
[1:13:42] you think when when Moses said got up
[1:13:44] there and he'd lived out his life 120
[1:13:47] years old and he got up there and he
[1:13:49] couldn't cross over and he climbed upon
[1:13:51] that mountain and he looked over the
[1:13:53] hair and he looked across the mountain
[1:13:55] brother Madam said he looked over and he
[1:13:58] said there stood a rock that he could
[1:14:00] stand on it and he said the angels of
[1:14:02] God packed him right into the bosoms of
[1:14:05] God and he said he never died he said
[1:14:07] because 800 years later there he was up
[1:14:10] there on Mount Transfiguration still
[1:14:13] being led by the leadership of the Lord
[1:14:16] let me tell you your loved one Homer
[1:14:19] Fraser never died
[1:14:21] Charlie Spencer never died Lord
[1:14:24] schiffert never died come on somebody
[1:14:29] Ted Hensley never died Leo hinchland
[1:14:32] ever died because they stepped onto a
[1:14:34] rock that looked that took them to a
[1:14:37] place and in the morning between six and
[1:14:40] nine when we look out the window we'll
[1:14:43] see those ones that was led to Iraq
[1:14:51] Moses just stepped onto that rock and it
[1:14:55] took him and put packed him right into
[1:14:57] the bosom of God
[1:15:01] and if you have died to yourself on this
[1:15:04] world
[1:15:05] in this life
[1:15:07] the angels are coming pack you away
[1:15:10] but you can never die
[1:15:15] if he can lead you through your walk
[1:15:18] if he can lead you through your
[1:15:19] Christian Life he can lead you through
[1:15:21] death
[1:15:22] he'll be the one that'll take you over
[1:15:24] toward it
[1:15:27] and he'll lead you all the way
[1:15:32] I believe
[1:15:34] sister Cassie used to sing a song
[1:15:36] Jehovah's here to lead us all the way
[1:15:41] I believe that same one is here and by
[1:15:44] the Bible tells us in Exodus 23 and 20
[1:15:47] that behold I send an angel before you
[1:15:49] to keep you all the way and brother
[1:15:51] random told us he said now if you want
[1:15:52] to catch a vision of what that angel
[1:15:54] looked like he said go over there in
[1:15:57] Exodus 13 and 21 he said and by the
[1:16:00] cloud by day and by the pillar of fire
[1:16:02] he led them and he took not away the
[1:16:05] cloud by night or Cloud by day nor the
[1:16:08] pillar of fire but I by night you see it
[1:16:11] was the same Angel Covenant that was
[1:16:13] leading them what was it that angel was
[1:16:17] the angel of the Covenant that stood
[1:16:20] there in Revelations chapter 10 it is
[1:16:22] that same angel that is here leading his
[1:16:25] church if he could lead them in a
[1:16:28] natural surely he can lead you in the
[1:16:30] spiritual
[1:16:31] you see they were simply the people of
[1:16:34] God until they were called out of Egypt
[1:16:36] then they were called The Church of God
[1:16:39] because you see they were called out of
[1:16:41] Egypt and what did this message say unto
[1:16:45] you little Bride come out of her my
[1:16:47] people what are you called you are the
[1:16:50] elect of God that all things are working
[1:16:53] together for the good of them that love
[1:16:55] God who are the called according to his
[1:16:59] purpose
[1:17:01] and to think that that he's the one
[1:17:03] that's leading you it's an amazing
[1:17:06] thought now brother random said here he
[1:17:08] said in the Samaritan Church age he said
[1:17:10] just as the early church started out
[1:17:12] under the pure Ministry of the holy
[1:17:14] spirit with signs and wonders and
[1:17:16] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[1:17:18] and interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[1:17:20] healing so in the days of Israel when
[1:17:23] they left Egypt they were under the same
[1:17:25] leadership the spirit of God manifesting
[1:17:28] in gifts God was the leader of the
[1:17:31] people actually he was their King he was
[1:17:34] a father King he took care of Israel
[1:17:36] like a man takes care of his family he
[1:17:39] fed them fought their battles smoothed
[1:17:42] away their difficulties settled their
[1:17:44] problems and he just busied himself over
[1:17:47] them now to think I could go there and I
[1:17:49] could preach I could preach a series
[1:17:51] right there on busy and busying himself
[1:17:54] over top of you not just to gather the
[1:17:57] thought just from a second you imagine
[1:17:59] you taking care of your children and
[1:18:01] busy yourself over feeding them and
[1:18:03] taking care of them and making sure they
[1:18:06] got good shoes and they got good food on
[1:18:08] their on your table heaped Jehovah
[1:18:10] busied himself over the people
[1:18:14] they weren't the only nation to which he
[1:18:17] was truly God but one day they got to
[1:18:19] looking around and they saw the
[1:18:21] Philistines and other nations with Kings
[1:18:23] over them and it caught their eyes and
[1:18:26] they decided that they ought to humanize
[1:18:27] their leadership so they wanted a king
[1:18:30] now God was going to humanize the
[1:18:33] leadership himself in the person of the
[1:18:35] Lord Jesus Christ but they got ahead of
[1:18:37] him and Satan knew the plan of God so he
[1:18:40] put it in the hearts of the people to
[1:18:43] get ahead of God the word you see God
[1:18:47] had it in his mind the whole entire time
[1:18:49] that he was going to humanize the
[1:18:51] leadership and put it into humanity and
[1:18:54] put it in our Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:18:56] Satan put something on the inside of the
[1:18:59] Church of the Living God that they
[1:19:01] needed an Earthly King that they could
[1:19:02] look onto what did Satan do he simply
[1:19:06] got them ahead of the word of God you
[1:19:09] see God Satan knew that they were going
[1:19:12] to have to reproduce in the Garden of
[1:19:14] Eden he simply got ahead of God's word
[1:19:17] and I'm afraid that too many times even
[1:19:19] in the message ranks today we've got
[1:19:21] people that are trying to humanize the
[1:19:23] leadership of the Holy Ghost and trying
[1:19:25] to tell you you got to get it through
[1:19:26] intellectualism try to get into a
[1:19:29] handshake or listen to so many tapes
[1:19:30] they try to humanize the leadership of
[1:19:34] the Holy Ghost I'll say this God
[1:19:37] Almighty Soul fit to take his picture
[1:19:39] with William Branham
[1:19:42] and I've only got to give account to
[1:19:44] listening to One Voice shouldn't this
[1:19:45] day I ain't got to listen to the
[1:19:47] preacher in Zimbabwe I ain't got to
[1:19:49] listen to the preacher over here or the
[1:19:51] preacher over there there is one voice
[1:19:54] and if God thought enough to take his
[1:19:56] picture with Malachi 4 I'll listen to
[1:19:59] The Voice that'll lead us right into a
[1:20:02] rapture we don't need to humanize the
[1:20:04] leadership of the Holy Ghost you ain't
[1:20:06] got to look to me all you got to do is
[1:20:08] look to the leadership of almighty God
[1:20:16] if you go to studying out Ezekiel
[1:20:17] Ezekiel chapter 1 that they are Ezekiel
[1:20:21] was up there Ezekiel was up there he was
[1:20:24] among those amongst the captives they
[1:20:26] are in Babylon and the Bible went on to
[1:20:29] say that that the heavens were opened up
[1:20:31] and Ezekiel Saw Visions he was there in
[1:20:35] Babylon but the Holy Spirit began to
[1:20:37] open up heaven and show him the living
[1:20:40] creatures it showed him the face of a
[1:20:43] man he showed him thy Ox it showed him
[1:20:45] the it showed him the line it showed him
[1:20:47] the eagle anointing what was it brother
[1:20:50] random told us he said those living
[1:20:52] creatures represented the Church of the
[1:20:55] Living God and there Ezekiel goes up
[1:20:58] there and he catches the the appearance
[1:21:01] of the glory of the Lord and you go to
[1:21:05] studying out Ezekiel you'll find you'll
[1:21:07] find that Ezekiel that Ezekiel begins to
[1:21:09] tell us exactly what the pillar of fire
[1:21:12] looked like
[1:21:13] and you match it up with the message of
[1:21:15] the hour it's according according to the
[1:21:17] word of God that Vera was a green
[1:21:20] yellowish Amber looking light and
[1:21:22] brother and the Bible said in Ezekiel
[1:21:24] chapter 1 that the appearance it had the
[1:21:27] appearance of fire and Amber Amber look
[1:21:29] and it covered them from the Lord's up
[1:21:31] loins upward and the loins downward what
[1:21:35] was it a sign it was not the Lord but it
[1:21:37] was the glory of the Lord that was
[1:21:39] covering the church
[1:21:42] it was a covering of the church and
[1:21:45] William Brandon was said now now that
[1:21:46] same pillar fire that Amber looking
[1:21:49] greenish light that has followed me all
[1:21:52] the days of my life he said it's here in
[1:21:55] this room he said it's proof that the
[1:21:57] Lord is here
[1:21:59] it's proof that the Lord is here you can
[1:22:02] go and listen to him look it up on on
[1:22:04] your apps and look it up through the
[1:22:06] message every time he talked about that
[1:22:08] pillar fire that greenish Amber looking
[1:22:10] life as it moves in and he works over
[1:22:14] this congregation he works over this
[1:22:16] patient he begins to tell them the very
[1:22:18] secrets of the heart I see I see you're
[1:22:20] not from here you're not an American
[1:22:22] you're a Canon you're from Canadia
[1:22:24] you're from you're a Canadian and and I
[1:22:27] see you you've come here you've got
[1:22:28] you've got this cancer problem and that
[1:22:31] purifier is standing over you you feel
[1:22:33] it right now you're aware of that
[1:22:35] there's somebody that's standing over
[1:22:37] top of you now who touched you you're
[1:22:39] more than 50 feet away from me I didn't
[1:22:41] touch you it had to be him
[1:22:44] what was it there was a prophet that was
[1:22:47] standing there and telling you that
[1:22:50] there was a the very same one that was
[1:22:53] leading the children of Israel that was
[1:22:55] standing over top of this person and it
[1:22:57] was telling them the very secrets of
[1:22:59] their heart what was it it was the man
[1:23:02] of God being led by the pillar of Fire
[1:23:07] you go to studying out you go to
[1:23:09] studying out the with that picture there
[1:23:11] in Green Grass Valley California where
[1:23:14] the seven licks of fire that that showed
[1:23:16] up when the photographer he said take a
[1:23:18] picture he snapped a picture and it's
[1:23:20] perfectly it's perfectly in line or it
[1:23:22] looks exactly like it is and the Holy
[1:23:24] Spirit said take another picture and
[1:23:27] everything is magnified and the spirit
[1:23:29] of the Living God is there in the seven
[1:23:30] licks of fire and the lion of the tribe
[1:23:33] of Judah and brother Brandon would tell
[1:23:34] us he said now if you look at that
[1:23:36] picture he said you'll see standing
[1:23:38] behind me is my old Indian nature back
[1:23:41] there he said it he said every he said
[1:23:43] it's always there and it's standing
[1:23:46] right there and it'll tell you certain
[1:23:48] things but you're not under the
[1:23:49] leadership of that
[1:23:52] Hallelujah
[1:23:54] and bear that pillar fire showed up
[1:23:56] signs has even shown itself that the
[1:23:59] pillar of fire is back
[1:24:03] amongst the Church of the Living God and
[1:24:06] we recognize that the Bible has told us
[1:24:08] that Jesus said that I came from God and
[1:24:11] I go back to God
[1:24:14] and we recognize that when Jesus that
[1:24:17] Jesus is that pillar fighter
[1:24:20] who was it a bear that met Peter in the
[1:24:22] prison house and smote him on the side
[1:24:24] and said get up it was the same Lord
[1:24:27] Jesus Christ who wasn't up there when
[1:24:29] Paul was on the road to Damascus and he
[1:24:32] said Lord
[1:24:34] Lord what are you what are you doing
[1:24:36] here he said Gee he said Paul it's hard
[1:24:39] for you to King against the prince what
[1:24:42] was it it was the same Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:45] in the pillar of Fire
[1:24:47] now Paul being a Hebrew scholar would
[1:24:50] have never called him Lord unless he
[1:24:52] knew it was our Lord
[1:24:53] laughs what was it Jesus had returned
[1:24:57] back to the pillar of Fire
[1:25:00] what was it when they were up there on
[1:25:02] the day of Pentecost and they were up
[1:25:04] there in one town and in one mind in one
[1:25:07] Accord they were up there in unity now
[1:25:10] brother Baron told us he said this
[1:25:11] church he said you're not divided he
[1:25:14] said but when you come under the unity
[1:25:16] when you come under the unity of the
[1:25:18] Holy Spirit he said just like he
[1:25:20] separated himself in cloven tongues up
[1:25:23] there on the day of Pentecost he
[1:25:25] separated himself amongst the church
[1:25:30] I think it's amazing when you begin to
[1:25:31] think about God separating himself and
[1:25:34] putting him part of himself inside of
[1:25:36] brother Doug a part of himself in in
[1:25:39] brother Lawrence a part of himself and
[1:25:41] Sister Mary and sister Katie that God
[1:25:43] has departed or separated himself
[1:25:46] amongst his church and brother random
[1:25:49] said when you come under Unity under the
[1:25:52] word that Jesus left us where to agree
[1:25:55] touching one thing Let It Be he said
[1:25:58] there if two agree coming in my name
[1:26:01] there I will be in the midst of them and
[1:26:04] to think that tonight that when you come
[1:26:07] here you wasn't just LED here by your
[1:26:09] own feeling you were LED here by
[1:26:11] somebody
[1:26:13] and you begin to move into the rhythm of
[1:26:16] the worship you begin to feel the
[1:26:18] anointing of God as he come down and
[1:26:20] worship
[1:26:23] are you with me
[1:26:24] you know what I'm saying the song leader
[1:26:27] come out here he began to wake up your
[1:26:29] spiritual Soul he began to Lead You In
[1:26:32] songs of Zion and he began to awaken the
[1:26:35] spiritual aptitude of your life
[1:26:38] he began to call you out of the darkness
[1:26:40] of laodicea into the light of worship
[1:26:43] because when you are in worship you are
[1:26:46] at your closest to God

[1:28:44] you go to setting out Revelations
[1:28:46] chapter four number two you go to
[1:28:48] studying out in 1960 brother Branham
[1:28:50] tells us all about that greenish amber
[1:28:52] light tells us what the pillar fire
[1:28:53] looked like he said nephil go to
[1:28:55] studying out those same colors are
[1:28:58] represented in that rainbow he said he'd
[1:29:00] go down through there he said you watch
[1:29:02] he said it's the same colors that is
[1:29:05] being pushed out through that Covenant
[1:29:07] that God wouldn't destroy this world
[1:29:10] again
[1:29:11] he said but if you look at it it only
[1:29:14] covered half of the Earth
[1:29:16] he said but when John goes over there in
[1:29:19] Revelations chapter 1 he looks over
[1:29:22] there and the Halo of light is covering
[1:29:25] all of the Throne of God and to think
[1:29:27] that tonight you are under a covenant

[1:30:05] living by the power and the resurrection
[1:30:08] of Christ this same Amber colors has
[1:30:12] covered it

[1:33:37] the cloak of the shadow of death that
[1:33:39] would be upon this sister and all of a
[1:33:41] sudden it's gone

[1:35:39] oh boy
[1:35:43] the Brandon said that the pill or fire
[1:35:45] would have returned in this generation
[1:35:49] would return in this generation and it
[1:35:52] would manifest the son of man
[1:35:54] he said
[1:35:55] dogmas Creeds
[1:35:57] denominationalism will never hinder it
[1:36:01] [Laughter]
[1:36:03] did not hinder the pillar of Fire coming
[1:36:06] back and manifesting the son of man it
[1:36:09] didn't hinder us it hasn't hindered our
[1:36:11] worship it hasn't hindered our praise it
[1:36:14] hasn't hindered our breakthrough
[1:36:20] what is it it's a pillar of fire leading
[1:36:29] somebody's going to be like the one
[1:36:31] leper
[1:36:35] 10 of them got healed but one of them
[1:36:38] returned and gave thanks
[1:36:41] who's going to be the one that walks
[1:36:43] back
[1:36:46] and give thanks to the son of man
[1:36:47] because he brought a pillar of fire that
[1:36:49] drive the leprous condition out of your
[1:36:52] life when you couldn't overcome sin in
[1:36:54] your own life when you couldn't overcome
[1:36:55] your troubles in your own life
[1:36:58] the one that had the power over leprosy
[1:37:05] I heard brother Chris pray in his prayer
[1:37:07] come to the always
[1:37:14] I can't get to every one of you
[1:37:16] no man of God can touch you
[1:37:20] but that pill or fire can just sweep
[1:37:22] past you
[1:37:25] how many times have we heard it
[1:37:27] not just in brother Brandon's day but
[1:37:28] right here in this day
[1:37:30] how many times have we heard it
[1:37:32] that I was dealing with this shoulder
[1:37:34] condition
[1:37:37] I was dealing with this backache
[1:37:39] you know I had this I had this
[1:37:41] tendonitis and I had this I had this
[1:37:43] problem
[1:37:44] and all of a sudden I just felt this
[1:37:46] warm presence come over me
[1:37:50] and I I didn't even think about it but I
[1:37:52] began to Worship the Lord
[1:37:55] and after I worship I recognized that it
[1:37:57] was gone
[1:38:00] I was up
[1:38:02] for a dislocated shoulder surgery
[1:38:05] and Jason Jackson was preaching and
[1:38:07] there was a there was a hand that laid
[1:38:11] its hand on my shoulder
[1:38:14] and I couldn't even told you after that
[1:38:16] night which shoulder it was that I was
[1:38:19] needing surgery on
[1:38:20] because when God does something
[1:38:22] he does it right
[1:38:28] when we get a testimony
[1:38:30] of 95 cancer free of my brother Joseph I
[1:38:36] say when God does something he does it
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:39] if doctors can say 95 they're going to
[1:38:43] have to agree with 100 of Isaiah 53 and
[1:38:47] 5.
[1:38:49] I say that it was the same one that
[1:38:52] walked through these aisles that worked
[1:38:54] through this body that calls the son of
[1:38:56] man to pray cancer be gone and you watch
[1:39:00] cancer leave the body cancer leave the
[1:39:03] soul
[1:39:09] tell me who can stand against the name
[1:39:12] of the most high God
[1:39:14] tell me what weapon can be formed
[1:39:16] against this church and it Prosper I'll
[1:39:19] say of God before this church ain't no
[1:39:22] devil and Hell going to be able to stop
[1:39:24] us
[1:39:25] [Applause]
[1:39:37] I was one way
[1:39:41] and he come and caught me
[1:39:43] and me turned me down another path
[1:39:47] foreign
[1:39:48] if you knew me before
[1:39:50] and you know the guy afterwards
[1:39:53] you'll find that somebody turned the
[1:39:55] steering wheel
[1:40:00] somebody took over
[1:40:04] and took control
[1:40:07] I'm a very emotional human being
[1:40:16] but if you really get me alone with
[1:40:19] almighty God
[1:40:21] I'm quiet as a church mouse
[1:40:25] you get me up in my prayer room and all
[1:40:27] of a sudden he's got me by the shoulders
[1:40:29] all I can do is cry
[1:40:32] but you get me out here under the burden
[1:40:33] of this word
[1:40:35] and he'll think what in the world's got
[1:40:36] a hold of that wild man
[1:40:40] it's somebody that's taken over
[1:40:44] now you watch
[1:40:46] you watch men of God
[1:40:49] you watch men like
[1:40:51] you liked when men like our our precious
[1:40:54] friend brother Joe Greene he's quiet
[1:40:57] but you watch him you watch him get
[1:41:00] behind the pulpit
[1:41:01] he'll get fired up what is it it's
[1:41:03] somebody leading him under the burden of
[1:41:05] the word
[1:41:08] you want somebody that's necessarily
[1:41:10] that that is conservative in their own
[1:41:13] emotion
[1:41:15] and you watch the spirit of the Living
[1:41:16] God get on them
[1:41:18] what is it somebody is leading them
[1:41:22] you watch you watch brother let's just

[1:41:35] the spirit of living God get on top of
[1:41:37] them man they get LED and they roll
[1:41:39] around on the ground and they'll they'll
[1:41:41] jump and scream and holler it's somebody
[1:41:44] it is an anointing that is causing the
[1:41:47] preaching of the word to come forth
[1:41:49] because of my the foolishness of
[1:41:52] preaching men are saved not foolish
[1:41:55] preaching but by the foolishness of
[1:41:57] preaching he'll make you rolling around
[1:41:59] on the ground just to make an
[1:42:00] illustration to show that you're not
[1:42:02] being led by yourself
[1:42:06] you'd never be here you wouldn't be in
[1:42:09] the building if it wasn't for him
[1:42:12] but aren't you glad that somebody
[1:42:15] come now your way
[1:42:18] if he went by legion's way and he got
[1:42:21] him out of 2 000 demon shackles surely
[1:42:24] he can get you out of your mess
[1:42:26] why don't you stand to give God praise
