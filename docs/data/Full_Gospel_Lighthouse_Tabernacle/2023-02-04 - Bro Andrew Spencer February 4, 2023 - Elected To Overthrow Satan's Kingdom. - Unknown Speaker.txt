just go to the Lord in prayer tonight father we come before you Lord Jesus and Lord we have our our cups turned over father tonight Lord we sincerely desire father that you'd fill us Lord Jesus Lord fill us with your spirit Lord Fearless with your nature and your desire the Lord may we empty ourselves out father Lord that we wouldn't be full of ourselves we wouldn't be full of the world but we'll be full of you father Lord I really feel Lord Jesus that we are at the coming of the Lord father and we don't want anything here to hinder us father Lord to to escape the judgments that are to come and Lord we sincerely desire father that you would wash us that we'd be wider than snow father and Lord I as I heard the prophets say today Lord if if I'm not a Believer make me a Believer if there's any here that isn't a Believer to not make them a Believer father Lord I feel Lord if our Prophet could stand there seeing all the actions and seeing the demonstrations of the Holy Spirit you could stand there in the closing hours of his ministry and said Lord if I'm not a Believer make me a Believer I pray father that you'd come Lord and may you take our unbelief father and cast it aside and build our faith up in you father we recognize Lord tonight that there is a gathering of people father but these people have not gathered Lord Jesus Lord to take up an empty Pew father but Lord they have gathered Lord to hear from you father Lord we are a very special people Lord that we get very we're very aware that you're here father because we brought you here and your word said that we're two or three are gathered in my name there you'll be in the midst of them and father we recognize that we are in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost father and in this atmosphere Supernatural events begin to transpire and take place father and Lord I would ask Lord I know that there's sometimes Lord Jesus that that an atmosphere doesn't transfer over throughout the streaming but father I know there's great power in an atmosphere but I pray those on the other side of this stream father we've got family that are setting here that that that are sick tonight Lord and can't be here but I pray father that that you would compensate father and you would begin to translate Lord the same atmosphere that's in this room through that stream father I think it's a very very amazing that we that are accustomed to the moving of the Holy Spirit we recognize what is happening father even though we may be thousands of miles away we recognize that it's your doing father and we want to be careful father tonight Lord to give you due Lord what is your glory and your honor father now Lord I ask God that you would move us all aside Lord we're all very needy people father Lord I know that we're in a season of time father that we recognize that the bodies can become weakened under conditions of sickness but I pray that the Healer would rise in this place with healing in his wings and you would root over this congregation and over your children tonight Lord that they could experience the healing touch of the master Lord as you'd walk with the pews tonight and move through this this place I pray God that you would just begin to liberate people in their Spirit father may they begin to let go of of the circumstances of life and may they recognize that the Holy One of Israel is in the midst of the Church of the Living God father we commit this service unto you tonight I pray you'd bless us as we get out of the way tonight and we completely yield ourselves over to the power of the Holy Spirit just now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of Exodus the book of Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. and down to Ephesians the book of Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 there read a few scriptures from both places there tonight and Exodus chapter 23 verse 20 if you have not read these scriptures they're very lovely they're very lovely and I I believe that it's something that we we should be very aware of that the angel of the Lord goes before us in all things amen I believe that the Lord knows how to trouble the waters before before we ever get into getting to this place he's already begin to stir and begin to change change situations before you ever got here to get you into a condition to be able to receive what he is getting ready to disperse I think it's amazing how the Lord can deal with his children on both ends and he can align the service just for you and I I think it's amazing that the Lord can custom fit a service for one individual but he can take one service and begin to deal with people's hearts all over this building and everyone will sit here and think my goodness he was talking directly to me I love it when the Lord begins to he just custom fits a service just for us and so let's just read these scriptures tonight Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20. behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not Harden your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary under thine adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites the Hittites the parisites the Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off and thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but Thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and you shall serve the Lord your God let's say that together and you shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and I will take away I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be Barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill I will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom Thou shalt come and I will make an end I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and I will send Hornets before thee which shall drive out the heaven the Canaanite and the hitchhot from before thee Ephesians chapter 1. in verse 3. it's lovely when the Lord will fight your battles for you and you don't have to fight them but you can rest in Secure knowing that the Lord is fighting your battles by these scripture readings we recognize that Israel can only be blessed when she is in her land it's the only way that Israel can ever be blessed is when she is in her land and when she is in her land she is in the portion that the Lord has divided unto her now notice that Ephesians Ephesians parallels the Book of Joshua notice that this is our inheritance it is the inheritance of the believer Ephesians if you haven't went through it the last lately I would admonish you especially your young people to go through the book of Ephesians and the Book of Philippians it'll do you great well it'll do you really it'll it'll strengthen your your Christian walk but notice Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him let's say that together he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord and by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you tonight on a thought on elected to overthrow Satan's kingdom elected to overthrow Satan's kingdom and Webster describes that word overthrow it it means it has the meaning to turn upside down or to throw down to ruin or to demolish to defeat to conquer to Vanquish as to overthrow an army or an enemy to ruin to demolish to defeat or to conquer and to Vanquish and to think that tonight that God would use the elect of God to overthrow the enemy and and we recognize that it is a paradox that God would take human beings that have mortalities surrounding them and they would take an immortality or an immortal word and they would overcome the Enemy by that word of demonstration or that word of power that is allotted to them in their generation and the reason why the church or the children of Israel was moving into the promised land was because there was a promise that was foretold that they were going to go into that land and they had all kinds of enemies that were already there but this was their land and they had to go in there and they had to go in and possess that land and there's a lot of things that the enemy would like to squat on and say that that he has ownership of but brother Brandon would tell us in the restoration of the broad tree that Satan is a squatter and we are to kick him off of our land it's the same way with our healing without with anything that the Lord has for us all of the blessings of the Lord there is an enemy that would like to keep you off of your rightful property but you have the ability by the word of God to go in there and to overthrow the kingdom of Satan now notice the Bible says in Proverbs 12 and 7 that the wicked are overthrown and are not but the house of the righteous shall stand so notice that the wicked are overthrown and there is nothing left of them again Proverbs 14 11 that the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the Tabernacle of the upper right is Chef Roars now I personally enjoy watching a good fight and personally enjoy watching when God begins to overthrow Satan's plans and all of his devices and all of his techniques that he has built against us as a children of God I personally enjoy it then when God goes in there and all of the things that Satan has devised against us to be evil that God turns those things into into good for our good because we are the cause called according to his purpose and I think it's amazing when you can go back and you can it's easy for us to go back and look throughout the Old Testament and we can see that there was a promise for the children of God for them to go in there and to possess their inheritance but it's amazing when when the when job didn't have a Bible and job didn't have a letter that was set before him but job had a faith that was resilient against all of the Skeptics that were saying that he was a carnal believer or he was a secret sinner but there if job had a faith in almighty God that God was his inheritance and job overthrew the doubt of the Enemy by his faith in almighty God and you know that God and Satan had a conversation about job that job that God had a conversation with him about job and job was job was being talked about by almighty God and the arch enemy of God and he was having a conversation that this man this man job he was he was such a man and the Bible would declare to us in Job chapter 1 that this man was perfect and to think that God had looked upon job's life before he ever had a conversation with Satan he had looked upon job's life and there God looked upon his life and he had a conversation about this man I'd say that we could have this kind of conversation maybe about yourself here tonight or or any believer that's filled with the Holy Ghost that God has had a conversation with Satan they're a real believer they can go through the thick and they can go through the sin and I will be there with them because I am their God and they are my children and God had a conversation about job he said no matter what you do to him he'll not curse me he'll not turn his back against me because job had something on the inside of him that a vision had broke over his life that he could recognize that the god of the atmosphere was a God over every situation in his life and I'll tell you if you begin to catch that Vision tonight that God is here in this place right now he's working in your midst he's working over your situation but we recognize that the Bible was not written to show us only what God has done in the past but the Bible was written to show us who God is and what he wants to do in every generation and in every Walk of Life and everywhere on the Earth but we recognize that God is wanting to display his attributes he's wanting to display his power now we recognize that brother random I'm just going to lay some things down real real heavily at first here tonight and then we'll jump over and begin to preach to you but you're very aware of these things and I'm getting ready to bring to you but if you could just amen and agree with it it will just establish a foundation real quick that brother Brandon would tell us in the greatest battle ever fought he said now the great he said the first battle that was ever fought began in heaven when Michael and his angels fought against Lucifer and his angels He said it first started the first battle was in heaven so sin did not originate here on Earth it originated in heaven he said and then it was thrown down from heaven cast out of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human beings then the battle from Angels become human battles and Satan come to destroy God's creation what God had created to be for himself he had Satan come to destroy this that was his purpose that was to destroy it then the battle began here on Earth and began in us and has been raging ever since so Angelic battles Angelic battles became human battles and you can look that there God was not surprised by all of the doings of Satan or Lucifer they are in heaven and notice that God and the angels in heaven were victorious so it is a sound to you tonight that if those Angelic battles have become human battles it is assigned to us as a Church of the Living God that we are going to be victorious now we know that that Satan needs Satan needs a vehicle Satan needs somebody that he can work through he is a spirit he's real and he's he's just as real as you sitting here tonight but he needs a body that he can work through you see God is a spirit and God has got to have a body that he can work through is that right and so Satan needed a vehicle so that he could work through and you notice his technique as soon as he's kicked out of heaven that he immediately goes down to the Garden of Eden and he begins to cast out and reasonings over onto the daughter of almighty God and where did he begin to battle her at was in the human mind because that is where decisions are made at but the Bible tells us and Paul was very clear on this that though we walk in the flesh we don't war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they are Mighty and strong in pulling down the strongholds of of Satan but notice what he said he said that we are to bring every thought subject to The Obedience of almighty God now if you begin to just take a few minutes and begin to think just for a moment that if you would take every thought that has passed through your mind if you would bring it under the Obedience of Christ I'd say that you'd have a different outlook on all things in your life I'd say that if you brought every thought every single thought that's passed through your mind under the mind of almighty God and subject to the word of God you'll look at things differently I'd say that if you bring his sickness under the thought and Under The Obedience of God you look at sickness a little bit different you look at depression a little bit different you look at the battle that you're facing just a little bit different if you'd bring it under captivity Under The Obedience of almighty God notice now notice that the brother random when brother random preaches the greatest battle ever fought and and if you listen to it very carefully that brother random begins to speak to a little girl that is in that building and she's there and she's very sick you can go and listen to her and I believe brother Byron refers to this little girl in that meeting 11 times you can go and look it up but she's there in that meeting she's very sick and brother Brandon would tell us brother Brandon would tell us had said that if she doesn't get well that she that the doctors have gave up hope that that the sickness is going to be too bad and she's she'll be gone before long but brother random identifies or he addresses this little girl and the sickness that she has all throughout the building all throughout that sermon and he's and he's what he's doing he's trying to draw that little girl to the faith that she can accept that the battle is already over now I know that I know that all of us were very aware we're very aware that all needs are important but there's not ever been one child that I've ever prayed for that I can ever forget them because a child does something to you that that maybe somebody else doesn't do to you a child I can remember every child I pray for I can remember every need that I prayed for because they do something to your heart they do something to your heart and here here's the prophet and he's and he's driving these things now notice he said you've got to meet your enemy in the mind he said you've got to make your choice he said it meets you he said I want this little girl here that's very sick to be sure to listen now to this really closely he said decisions are made in the mind the head he said there is where Satan meets you at and the decisions are because that God made a man that way you see brother Branham was describing to her that she was going to have to make a decision that she was going to accept Christ as her healer now we recognize that the Bible has told us that for this purpose was the son of God manifested to destroy the works of the devil so the very manifestation of the Son of God was to ruin the very plans of Satan foreign I know that I know that you feel like sometimes that you are going through your worst of battles and it looks like Satan's got he's got the greatest plan stacked up against your family and it looks like there's no end to the plans of Satan but I want you to know that God was manifested to ruin ruin the plans of Satan God was brought here to destroy every depression devil every anxiety devil every Cancer devil God was brought here and manifested to destroy the very workings of Satan all right now you go you go and watch that little girl throughout that service brother Brandon goes and he has a prayer line he goes he has a prayer line and he prays for her at the pulpit he goes down there and he prays over that little girl and he starts having a prayer line and brother Branham brother random comes back and he starts praying for all everybody else then all of a sudden brother by them turns to that little girl he said it's gone you're going to go home and be well and it'll be different now what did she recognize is that she accepted that the battle was the Lord's you don't understand brother random said that she was the sickest person in the building I want you to know it doesn't matter if you're the sickest case in this building it doesn't matter where you are listening on the internet if you're the sickest person it's going to be different now go and accept your healing Hallelujah Hallelujah recognize no matter what it is that sickness is a spirit you say Amen to that that sickness is a spirit that cancer is a spirit anxiety is a spirit oppression is a spirit headaches are a spirit Bruce cells Bruce sells is where Satan gets in and he attaches himself to but what is it that first it's a devil first to the devil and then he comes in and he attaches himself to a little sickness in a body and you say well my my grandpappy deal with this my grandma dealt with this and it's just passed throughout my genealogy that I'll have to deal with those things I'm sure that there are things that are laying there in your DNA that no doubt that Satan comes in and he attaches himself to but you've got to recognize that the devil is real and you've got to overcome him and William Branham had said and how can I overcome he said to overcome the devil is to recognize him in every one of his tricks and Satan will come in and trick you into talking the language of Satan saying I'll never get no better I've never overcome this battle I'm never I'll never get healthy again that's exactly the language that Satan is wanting you to talk [Music] another man I'm with brother random would take some messages in there in his early Ministry or demonology I think it's amazing that a prophet would come down and he would he would break down what these demons are and what they look like he said many times he said I'll I'll see those demons in that spirit world he said many of them will look like him he said they'll come out and he said they look like great big 50-pound spiders coming out you remember Nellie Saunders that when he cast The Devil out of her that big bat flying that big bat flew out it looked like it was a devil flying out of there it scared away and Fletcher half to death but you remember he would tell us in demonology he said now you watch your children you watch your children he said this epileptic demon he said it seems to get away from me sometimes he would stand there at the pulpit and he said I'll now take every Spirit under my control for in the name of almighty God and he said now you watch your children he said you want your children he said because it's epileptic demon can get away from me sometimes now what was it it was a slick devil now notice he said it looked and it come out in the form of a tortoise it was it was hard to move it was hard to move he said but you watched that oppression devil he said it comes out in the spirit world he said that oppression Devil is a great big cloud that hangs over people and he said when it's cast out it makes a funny sound and not exactly how oppression hits you he comes and clouds up your mind and makes you doubt what God has said he brings you depression and clouds up your mind to think that you'll never be good enough but I can prove to you by the Bible there's never been one case of Oppression there's never been one case of cancer that can stand up to the power of almighty God oh he tell us a cancer he said cancer was crab like he said it had it had legs he said he would reach out and he would grab he said but the chief of them Devils the chief of them devils was unbelief the chief of them Devils was unbelief now notice here's a prophet looking into the world the world that you face and you don't run you don't recognize that you're running into these demons all day long you're running into them and you think where in the world did that thought come from but the chief of them Devils is unbelief but we recognize that Spirits don't die you recognize that brother Brandon told us that those spirits that were up there in Legion were still here today he said those demons cried that they would take leave and go into that herd of swine over there on that hill and he said those same demons are here now you see God takes his man but he never takes his spirit and Satan comes and he comes into you he comes into a being comes into sickness and God's commission to the Church of the Living God is to cast Satan out and Satan has got to have a body to work through that's why we tell you as children to keep your children Sovereign keep them private keep them reverent sitting there because you never know the enemy might get loose in a service and you'll go after somebody that's being misreferent in the service I'm not trying to scare you but I'm trying to teach you Bible Doctrine here but notice that notice that even that Jezebel Hill it wasn't something that you just read about over in the book of Kings but it was a spirit that got on the King's wife that got on her that it was still passed down throughout all of history and it was found over in the Book of Revelations in the fire and church age that the spirit of Jezebel was working in her daughters what is it Spirits don't die they can take on any form brother random said you look at that sarcoma cancer he said he said a spirit can take on any form he said it he said that sarcoma cancer he said it Stacks itself on top of each other like a pancake and it layers itself back and forth he said that Spirit can take on any form foreign would say I was looking for this I was looking for this thought today and brother random said he said many times he said those demons will follow me back home he said they followed me back through my room and he said I felt them rubbing their flesh rubbing their bells and things and he said they'll Haunt at me half the night you think about that old scaly devil rubbing his dirty old Paws all over the prophet and the prophet recognized it that it was a blood that was protecting him are you with me you see there is a blood that is here tonight I'm just trying to make you aware that there is a spirit world but there the prophet recognized those demons was rubbing up against him taunting at him tormenting him trying to get to him make him disbelieve the word but there was a blood that stopped every devil from making its Force powerful over the man of God you think my goodness where are we living at we're living exactly in the days of Prophecy that when Daniel when Daniel would tell us over in the Book of Daniel chapter 12 that we recognize that the Book of Daniel is to the Jews as the Book of Revelation is to us as a Church of the Living God that there in Daniel chapter 12 that the Bible said that Michael shall stand up and there shall be a time of trouble like never that has seen before but you notice when you look over in Revelations chapter 10 that it is a conjunction at the beginning of it and I saw another Mighty angel coming down out of Heaven what is it is it conjunction of Revelations 9 to Revelations 10 that there was a smoke that was exuding out of that bottleless pit but in the time of trouble when there's cancer on a rampage when there when it looks like cancer is going to destroy the works of the Living God will destroy our bodies that is when the mighty Angel Christ the anointing of almighty God stands up in this generation but you look over in the Book of Daniel he said seal up those sayings but you look in this generation there's a people that is a prophesying again and they're taking the open book into the hands and they're taking thus saith the Lord let me tell you the Bride of Jesus Christ is the most powerful people there's not a demon of Oppression that's not a demon of sickness there's not a demon of you're never going to get it that can stand in the way of this open Word now Satan can come in and he can impersonate and he can attach himself to Ministries and make it look like the real thing but there is one thing that Satan cannot impersonate and it is this third poor well I'm going to scare Satan off of my motivation I'd say it ain't gonna work I'm gonna spear Satan off with my John Hagee quotes where I'm going to scare him off with my TD Jakes quotes I'm going to scare him off with my affirmations that I found on the internet it'll never work but you take this third pool Ministry and you put it in effect in your life and it'll destroy every death there ain't one devil that can stand in front of the third pole it is the opening of the word foreign notice the Bible said in Deuteronomy 7 and 6 and this is going to be one of them continuation services so y'all just buckle up and help me preach but the Bible said that thou art as holy people unto the Lord by God Deuteronomy 7 and 6 the Lord thy God had chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that are upon the face of the Earth so we recognize that we are prophetic class of people that have been given a prophetic insight to be able to see that the word of the Lord is open unto us another random would tell us that we have representation by predestination you ever been into a spot that only certain people could go into maybe you've been invited into the president of the office or the president of the company you've been given special operational uh privileges to be able to go into a certain room and William Branham told us that the Lord was going to meet us in this Upper Room he's going to meet us in this room here under this tent Ministry of the opening of the word they are the spirit of the Living God has given this bride special access you're wonder where the tent Ministry has had it's right here it's this 10 Ministry that God is wanting to work through now you know that if there's somebody that's in that room that ain't supposed to be there the law can kick them out of that room preach with me tonight if you ain't got access if you ain't got the wedding garment on you've got no reason to be in this room but if you've got the wedding garment on which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've got every right out of its third pool you've got every right if you've been baptized by the Holy Ghost you've got every right to be in this message of Malachi 4. you've got every right to call cancer undefeated for you've got every right don't overthrow every devil that you come up against you've got every right [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah I know where I am I know what I'm talking about I've got every right I'm standing in the opening of the word Satan himself can't close the book I don't need your access code God already gave it to me I don't need your badge God already gave me his badge this Badge of authority will cast Satan out of his kingdom this is the worst of Ages the darkest of Ages worst of all ages but you've been given special privileges to walk out of here and overcomer to walk out of here with a Victor's Crown on it it doesn't mean that you're not going to go through some stuff but you're going to get on a chariot and you're going to ride on this Chariot and because you've been granted access to caliber to get on the chief on the king's Chariot and ride with him he'll look at you and say why don't you get them scars out I got them fighting for you King Jesus and because you fought for me I'll let you ride with me throughout the victory you don't know where I'm living at but I'm trying to tell you that you are getting ready to ride on a chariot you don't recognize that you've been battling all hail all week long but the Holy Ghost is here to ride you straight to Victory I've been chosen to do this I've been elected to do this there ain't nobody that can kick me out of my my spot you can kick Trump out of his spot you can kick Joe Biden out of his spot but you'll never kick me out of my spot politicians will come and go but the King of Kings will live on and on and on and when there is no more politicians and when there is no more devil I will still be in Victory [Applause] foreign right here the word's been restored to you we under under we under we understand that there is a restored body that is a word born bride body that has accepted that the messenger like John stood up there when John stood up there and he said Behold the Lamb of God has come the first 400 did his job the second Forerunner done his job he's gathered the elect the elect have gathered around the word of this Howard and it has produced a word born bride that will look on and will lead us right to the coming of the Lord brother random comes and he preaches to us he takes on Easter subject after listening to brother Neville preach on Easter morning he said I went home and I wrote down a few notes and he comes back and preaches the restoration of the broad tree he comes down and breaks down all those common that I don't know if I said that right canker worm pump a worm you know what I'm saying this I'm glad y'all understand what I'm saying when I don't know what I'm saying I mean it breaks down breaks down right out of the Church of the Living God but he comes back and he preaches a restoration of the broad tree and he tells us that the fruit is at the top of the tree where does the fruit show up first at summertime where the Sun hits it first where is the evening lights shining in this day it's on this Pride body and you are producing exactly what God said to you and produce you got every right he said there's a law and you have a right to enforce the claims if the enemies come in and he stole your children you've got a right to take the token and enforce the claim if he's come in and taken your health away you've got every right to come in and enforce Acclaim so you got to fight for what you believe in they gotta fight for what you love it's like a day we're fighting like we never had before for the move of God and for the power of this message to be preached in its fullness you got to fight for it but notice the language of joab in first Chronicles 19 and 10. he said now when Joanne saw that the battle was set against him before him behind he chose out all the choice of Israel and put them in a ray against Assyrians and the rest of the people he delivered under the hand of Abisha his brother and they set themselves an array against the children of Ammon and he said if the sins be too strong for me then thou shall help me but if the children of them are be too strong for thee then I will help you be of good cheater and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our God and let the Lord do that which is good in his sights so notice that God isn't want some hot big plant that he's got to pet around he's wanting somebody that's persevered somebody that oppressed the battle like that little woman with the blood issue that had fought every battle had paid everything she gave up all that she had just to get well she had this issue in her life she was at the end of her witch but she heard about a man and she was persevering and she she went against her own thoughts she went against her own ideas she went against all the adversaries that told her that she'd never get well and she persevered through the crowd jealousy is a real devil foreign it's a spirit of jealousy that'll get on the person to make them feel like they need to get their healing first over this one but the spirit of Christ the spirit of Christ will put you in the first line with this woman through all her pain through all her agony through all our tears knowing what she's been through knowing what everybody else knows about her it don't take long it seems like good news is the hardest to spread but bad news spreads 10 times faster there's a woman with a blood issue in our midst and you know the customs of the law but this woman persevered through all the crowd and she touched him she touched him and when she touched him the Bible said that she was immediately made whole and brother made him said that that's what we need today is we need to press through every scale of unbelief and lock our swords with the devil and let him know that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever now he said now you got to press through every scale of unbelief and that's the greatest devil that we face in this age unbelief I think it's amazing that God there's one thing that I enjoy doing I don't get to do nearing much of it as I like to do but I enjoy fishing I'm surprised some of you sisters don't do more fishing if you message Believers because brother Baron said time stopped when he was fishing you don't have to worry about that beauty cream when you're out there fishing time stand still honey maybe that's how I'll get Katie to be able to let me buy a boat just kidding but you know when I go fishing I sure enjoy fishing but I enjoy The Spoils of fish and I enjoy eating that fish I don't get a whole lot of it but there ain't nothing like that Louisiana Fried Fish them boys down there and it seems like they can cook a fried fish better than anybody ever in my life if you ain't never had fried fish go to lose him one time let them boys fly and fire fry you up some fish but I tell you when you're fishing you don't stop at the scales you go on pasture scales and you get down to the meat of it because that's what you really want to eat at but God built these fish in such a way with the scales on top of them when you take a stripe at Bass you take a striping bass it's got all those scales man they're beautiful but they're more there than just for coloring but they're built there for a protection they're built there for a protection and though each of those scales can handle they can handle so much protection that they can that is protecting them from predators it's protecting them from if they would rub against the star a sharp Rock he won't go into them it won't hurt them God has built them in such a way that each of those scales can handle the force of three Newtons falling on them that's not Fig Newtons but that's a Newton in science world that'll tell you that a newton is it's the force of an apple falling off of a tree and each of those scales have the ability to be able to handle the force of three apples falling off a tree and hitting them and still protect them God's built them in such a way but brother bandham told us that we've got to press through every scale of unbelief that Satan has has built up this unbelief so strong against the Church of the Living God but he's given a power you can look about all the hundreds of scales that are upon that stripe of mass and you can think about the ability that God has given them to be able to handle and protect themselves from the from the attack of the Predators but God has given you something to press through every scale of the devil and every unbelief tactic that he's put against the church notice notice what brother Brown told us he said he said now we're we're living way too low we're living way beyond our way below our god-given privileges he said there's no reason why we should live below our god-given privileges he said when every Redemptive promise or every redempt a blessing that Jesus Christ died for is our personal property you watch you watch the language of brother you watch the language just go look up more than a match you watch the language of it but he gets on the other side he gets on the other side of the seals and he says you're more than a match for the enemy now notice before the seals he's telling you that that cry that Satan hear nothing you're not a match for the enemy but Christ is but he gets on the other side of the seals and he tells you that you're more than a match what is it you are robed in the flesh or in the righteousness of almighty God you see that's what God's spirit principle is is to lay the word in your spirit so that you get so knitted together knitted together that if we'd come here and get so knitted together in the power of unity there wouldn't be one sick person amongst us in five minutes time you notice mother bam deals with a Nickelodeon Spirit throughout his ministry that he comes in that that Nickelodeon spirit is to overthrow it's to overthrow the laity that's what the Nickelodeon spirit is to divide and to conquer he said that Nickelodeon Spirit he said it's an overthrow or to conquer the laity what they were trying to do he said here here he was trying to take the church with that Nickelodeon Spirit was trying to take the church to do here and trying to take the church where God had Pastors in the spirit of God moving the gifts in the Church of the Living God he's he said they they were had a Doctrine and they started out they were going to have some priests and Bishops and popes and so forth that God said he hated he hates it yet today he hates that nicolaitan in spirit but notice he said all right he said it means to overthrow or to conquer or to take place of the liberty of the laity he said in other words it should take all the sacredness of the power from the church and put it over on the priest you think about that Nickelodeon spirit that still works well I don't have to pray I'll just let the priest do it I'll let the pastor do it well you watch that spirit's very real but you are to overthrow every one of these demons even when you feel at your weakest you are to overthrow what is it it's the message that woke you up to the fact that you are a daughter and a son of God what was it in Matthew chapter 25 that when there was a Midnight Cry that woke up to sleep in virgin what was it it was the voice it was the voice and brother random told us in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that God's got a threefold purpose first and second but the second one was to have the preeminence in his broad body notice he wants how he wants to live voices in this generation what was it it was the voice of Resurrection that wake you up to the fact that you are a daughter of God oh the need of this hour is oil the need of this hour is oil it's the Holy Ghost that's the need of the hour notice what Satan tried to stop it's the wine and the oil he tries to stop the stimulation he tries to stop everything the move of God and the Holy Ghost moving over the church but notice what the Book of Revelation says hurt not the wine and the oil now notice there's one thing that Satan can do he can come in and he can try to steal to kill and destroy but God is here to give you life and life more abundantly foreign some thoughts and I'm building some things but here here in this hour that God is tabernacling himself in a bright body that she's she's bone of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power what is it she is the word kind and the word has got to produce exactly what it is so you've got to produce exactly what he is he said if I had the spirit of Dillinger in me you'd expect me to carry guns and shoot up the town he said if I had the spirit of Beethoven you would expect me to pray music and design all of these musical things he said but if I say I've got the spirit of Christ you would expect me to do the works of Christ I'm bringing this down really quick here but notice notice when he comes there that there is there is a time when he looks over in Romans chapter 9 and verse 11 that he said he so I've hated but Jacob I have loved he chose them before they was ever born upon the face of the Earth before they could ever make one action even though Jacob was going to be a shyster he was going to be a mama's boy but God had already chose Jacob because Jacob had recompense towards the birthrights he had recompensed the words of Birthright he loved the birthright he saw didn't care one thing about it but because Jacob was elected he cared for the birthright when he was a mama's boy he cared for the birthright when he was a no good shyster he cared for the birthright notice you've been elected to take the birthright you've been elected to walk in and make sure that your vessel is full of oil you've been elected to walk in and grab everything that is destined for you in this generation it ain't about what you do it this this choice is not your choice this is his choice he chose you before you could ever make your first wrong choice or make your first right choice he chose you when you looked unlovable he chose you Satan can battle you over your mind battles and all the things that Satan puts in your mind and makes you feel like you're not going to be good enough but God chose you well why don't everybody else understand it why don't everybody else grab it God chose you that little girl back here I chose her when she didn't want nothing to do with me I chose her and when we walked down through when we walked down there in Rutherford to North Carolina I was expecting her to come through them back doors I wasn't expecting nobody else to walk through them doors but her because I chose her now God ain't expecting get mad all you want to but God ain't expecting any of these any of these others to walk through the door when they haven't been put on the wedding bed but the token has been placed upon this bride she didn't do it herself you didn't make yourself a bride you didn't make yourself follow this message God put something on the inside of you and the rest of the world can't understand why you're walking this way and why you're talking this way it's something you had recompense towards the birthright and because you were Birthright you accepted it [Applause] you got a few more minutes for me notice when brother Brandon was laying there and he's facing that demon he's laying there in his bed and he and he heard he heard that little devil over in the corner just hissing at him he said he looked like alley-oop just to draw to your attention he said he looked like alley-oop he said I spoke to him and said Satan you're an offense to me get out of here in the name of Jesus Christ and he said all of a sudden he said the sweetest voice spoke to me he said never fear to go anywhere nor fail to go anywhere or anywhere anything or anywhere because a never failing presence of almighty God is with you wherever you go little Brad don't you fear to go anywhere the presence of the Living God has went before you and you are here Satan get out of here get out of my mind get out of my home get out of my family don't you fear to stand up to the devil the never failing presence of almighty God it's with you wherever you go get out of here get out of my mind get out my family get out of my home get out of my prayer life get out of my dance get out of my shout get out of my way devil you're an offense to me [Applause] brother Brandon my brother my sister going brother Brandon's hair and he has that vision of that black mama coming at him it's okay if I just keep dropping these things as they come has that black mamba's coming at him he's coming at him there was a voice that said watch out there's a great danger in this land you know what that black mama is I ain't going through the whole story he said but it's sudden death when it strikes you and he said there's great danger in the land today and he said he was going after my friend he said but God he said that voice spoke to me that voice spoke to me and said you've been given the power to bind him in the worst or any other so you've been given power to bind the strongest devil and the weakness to death and he said all of a sudden he said something seemed to have lifted me up and he said it charged me all over he said it charged me all over he said then all of a sudden he was coming at me and he said in the name of Jesus Christ I bind you he said now you've been given power to bind him and to lose him that's exactly what Jesus said in Matthew chapter 16 that whatsoever you bind on Earth I'll bind in heaven and whatsoever you loose on Earth how loose in heaven we have the ability to loose the devil by sinning and you have the ability to bind the Devil by accepting what God has said about you he said well I didn't mean to do that you may elused the devil in your life but you've been given power to bind the devil it seems like hell's all against your family you've been given power to bind him he seems like hell is all against your business from thriving but you've been given power to bind the devil Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go unto my father and that my father might be glorified and if you ask anything of my name I will do it Satan wants to overthrow your faith he wants to stop these little girls from getting the Holy Ghost he wants to stop every child here he wants to stop every family from becoming a message family let me just let me just deal with some things right here real quick that Satan wants to overthrow your marriage Satan wants to overthrow your family he wants to overthrow your prayer life he wants to overthrow your spiritual walk he wants to overthrow your business he wants to overthrow and get in your children you remember when William Branham goes through he goes through question and answers and he's dealing with children being being routed in these things he said now notice he said I had to come to a spot in my Ministry he said Rebecca I believe it was Rebecca had got so bad as a little child he said we couldn't even eat supper the way the way that we wanted to he said Mita would take turns Eden and then I would go in and take turns and we'd go outside the restaurant and we'd go eat it's the devil trying he said it was a devil trying to get at my Ministry and if Satan can't get you as a brother because you're the head of the home and you might be spiritually fortified by the word of God he'll start working on your family and he'll start working on your children and he'll start working his way in trying to stop your ministry at your home what is he trying to do he's trying to overthrow your faith what is he trying to overthrow it with unbelief one cigarette one rock and roll song just go listen to entice in spirits one time but brother Brandon told us in 1961 in the Easter seal he said they tried to put Christ in a tomb he said they tried to keep him in there he said but God ruined their theology he said they tried to go in there he said they're trying to put him in a Methodist tomb or a presbyterian tomb or a Nazarene tomb he said but God had ruined their theology do you recognize what Christ did on Easter morning he overthrew all of their theology now don't get mad at me I'm just telling you what a word Prophet said that he ruined their Theology and you can try to shut down the Acts 2 movement but we will ruin your theology you can try to shut down this message but we will ruin your theology you can try to shut down every Power but we will ruin your theology what is it this is a demolishing of Satan go read Esther chapter 7. go read chapter Esther chapter 7. as he comes in before the king she comes in before the king and she said look I and my people are sold I am my people are sold and the King said who has done this she said that Wicked amen that Wicked Haman is the one that did this what was Haman trying to do he was trying to thwart and stop the very genealogy of God from passing through what was he trying to do he was trying to stop God's Kingdom but when she set up her banquet of wine when she set up a banquet of stimulation she brought a Haman in there and she brought the king in there so she Hallelujah this bride has brought the devil and she's brought almighty God at the Fred the banquet of wine at the banquet of stimulation and said this old devil has tried to stop the move of God he's tried to stop my people he's tried to stop my family what did King of hazarus said go take the Gallows that Haman built for Mordecai and hang him high on it you're having a conversation with the King of Kings this ain't a hazardous this is almighty God who's talked about my family who's talked about my church they've tried to overthrow us they've tried to stop us go hang Satan on his own Gallows [Applause] him on his own Dallas he tried to stop you with depression hanging on it he tried to stop you of cancer hate him on it I don't think you understand what I'm saying to you that everything that has been planned against you every device every device every technique that always can aim until when it did this That Old Slew Foot but I want you to know brother Jim the pillar of fire can never be defeated where are we at we are at the Feast of wine again where are we at Satan cannot hurt this wine Satan cannot hurt this oil he cannot stop the move of God but the Church of the Living God has been placed in this hour to overthrow every devil every lay ought to seeing devil and I'm gonna preach to you I'm done I'm gonna preach to you but we are here to overthrow every devil that is going to try to stop us from going in the Rapture we're here to overthrow it and we're here to stop it and say Satan that's far enough I want you to know that you're dealing with a defeated devil you are dealing with a devil that is good as a dog on his chain he can only go so far this devil can hurt you he can afflict you but he can't take your life Satan take your hands off of God's Property they're God children there he is that Spirit can come and attach itself throw schizophrenia they're bipolar for Rebellion through cancer but the word of God turns it around let me tell you when you are in your worst of cases you need almighty God to turn the situation around now look what was it it was the messenger that brought the message to Esther said these things are being done what was it it was a messenger that brought this to you and said this is what the devil is going to do to you but this is how you overcome it what was given to the messenger the messenger said that what did the king say you give oh Mordecai all of the haman's land you give him all of his house you see Haman had been stacking up all of these plans and God gives the messenger his house everything that he'd stole from the Jews everything that he took from the Jews everything he was planting against the Jews he gave to Mordecai said do what you will worth it go read Rebel hour Esther chapter 8 and you look down there in Esther chapter 5 all the way through eight and Esther stood up before the king the king now look King now look this is how things are these are the things have been written about me can I get a little personal my family has been told that we will only live four months look at this look what Satan has said about us Satan has said everything against us he's brought all kinds of accusation against us that we never get the Holy Ghost he said we'd never get the Liberty he said we never overcome look at these things look what haman's wrote about me I want you to go through your mind real quick I don't want you to bring every thought Under The Obedience of God real quick I want you to bring everything that Satan said about you lately I don't want you to let every thought that's passed through your mind it said that said that you're gonna you're gonna die with the sickness you're never going to make it through this surgery I want you to bring it subject to the word of God foreign Esther said these words O King reverse the letters reverse the letters you know what they say in heaven that everything that the enemy meant to harm you you turn it around on him what did God say in Exodus 23 I will make your enemies turn their backs towards you I will reverse this oh and he told Mordecai you go up there and you take my ring and you make this sign and you sign it with my name you sign it with my name and reverse the letters he said there is no power that can overthrow the

Satan you take your depression devil and you take your leave in the name of Jesus Christ back pain back pain take your leave in the name of Jesus Christ Family Matters take your leave in the name of Jesus Christ oh hey hey you can't overthrow this name it's the king's word brother Brandon said in early Ministry I believe it was 1954 he preached a message on the invasion of the United States he said Satan invaded Hollywood he said he invaded us with fashion he invaded us he said he broke down politics and he said he'd come all the way in and he broke the back of mother he invaded you see you see if he can break down your home and Satan will tell you sisters that your job isn't very important brother Burnham said he said he come in and broke the backbone of America he broke mother come on I know I know this is but I'm very I'm very aware that I'm dealing with something yeah very real right here that Satan likes to come to our our mothers tell them that they're not good enough and tell them that their role isn't strong enough well brother Brandon said it's one of my favorites he said you give me a housewife you give me a factory worker they had to put God first in everything and I'll show you somebody that'll be successful in spite of all that the devil puts on them sister I want you to hear me loud and clear Satan cannot win and you are here to overthrow him it's time that

it's time you claim the token each time you're not looking at a broken Society you're looking at a whale you're looking at a well-old machine when you look at these mothers that are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost Satan don't know what to do with them may not they might just be a housewife and they sit around and clean their house but they're doing exactly what God ordained them to do
