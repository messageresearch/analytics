[47:49] and if you could just stay after service
[47:51] the parents and the kids there and we
[47:52] want to be remembering the Youth Camp

[48:01] that the Lord would do Mighty things and
[48:03] we've seen many many things at at at
[48:06] these youth camps and I'm so thankful
[48:09] for men of God that have a vision to
[48:11] continue to to uh support our youth and
[48:14] to uh to have places for them to come
[48:17] and know that that they're not provoked
[48:20] there but they are there they're they're
[48:22] standing there brothers and sisters that
[48:24] are just like them and just to see that
[48:26] just to see the work of the Lord
[48:27] continuing going on that to that we're
[48:29] grateful amen amen Joshua 5 and verse
[48:34] 1 and it came to pass that when all the
[48:37] kings of the amorites which were on the
[48:40] side of Jordan Westward and all the
[48:41] kings of the Canaanites which were by
[48:44] the Sea heard that the Lord had dried up
[48:47] the Waters of Jordan from before the
[48:49] children of Israel until we were passed
[48:52] over that their heart melted neither was
[48:55] their spirit in them any any more
[48:57] because of the children of Israel at
[49:00] that time the Lord said unto Joshua make
[49:03] these sharp knives and circumcise again
[49:05] the children of Israel the second time
[49:08] and Joshua made him sharp knives and
[49:10] circumcised the children of Israel at
[49:13] the hill of the forkins and this is the
[49:16] cause why Joshua did
[49:19] circumcise and all the people that came
[49:22] out of Egypt that were males even all
[49:24] the men of War died in the the
[49:26] Wilderness by the way after they came
[49:29] out of Egypt now all the people that
[49:32] came out were circumcised but all that
[49:36] the people that were born in the
[49:38] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[49:40] out of Egypt them they had not
[49:43] circumcised for the children of Israel
[49:45] walked 40 years in the wilderness till
[49:48] all the people that were Men of War
[49:51] which came out of Egypt were consumed
[49:53] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[49:56] Lord
[49:57] unto whom the Lord SAR that he would not
[49:59] show them the land which the Lord swar
[50:03] unto their fathers that he would give us
[50:05] a land that floweth with milk and honey
[50:08] notice and their children whom he raised
[50:11] up in their state them Joshua
[50:14] circumcised for they were uncircumcised
[50:17] because they had not circumcised them by
[50:20] the way and it came to pass that when
[50:23] they had done circumcising all the
[50:26] people that they Abode in their places
[50:28] in the camp till they were whole and the
[50:32] Lord said unto Joshua this day have I
[50:35] rolled away the reproach of Egypt from
[50:38] off of you wherefore the name of this
[50:41] place is called gilgal unto this day may
[50:43] God bless his word you may be seated
[50:46] tonight in the presence of the
[50:54] Lord also if you can turn with me over
[50:56] over in the Book of Romans The Book of
[50:59] Romans chapter 9 and verse
[51:03] 23 the Bible says here and that he might
[51:07] make known The Riches of his glory on
[51:10] the vessels of Mercy which he had a four
[51:13] prepared under glory and that that's
[51:16] just wonderful thing to recognize that
[51:18] God has set a predestinated course for
[51:21] us even us whom he hath called not of
[51:24] the Jews only but also of the Gentiles
[51:27] as he saith also in OSI which is Hosea I
[51:31] will call them my people which were not
[51:34] my people and her beloved which was not
[51:37] beloved and you find it amongst the you
[51:40] find it amongst the Hebrew people when
[51:41] you begin to study out their Traditions
[51:43] that that the Hebrew people would take
[51:45] great pride in being called the children
[51:47] of God or or calling themselves of the
[51:50] circumcision but you find that when you
[51:52] study out the when you begin to study
[51:54] out the history and You Begin to look at
[51:57] the Hebrew uh as a n as a national
[52:00] course you begin to look at it that they
[52:02] they would take that that sign of
[52:04] circumcision as a badge of superiority
[52:08] that it was that what it actually did it
[52:10] actually fostered a spirit of
[52:13] exclusivism amongst the amongst the
[52:15] Hebrews there and then that the Hebrews
[52:18] or the Jews would simply regard to the
[52:21] to they would regard the Gentiles as the
[52:24] uncircumcision but I'm so glad to know
[52:26] know that the Bible is very clear upon
[52:28] this on this evidence that that Jesus
[52:31] would even speak about the Gentiles that
[52:33] in his name would the Gentiles trust so
[52:37] notice verse 26 that and it shall come
[52:39] to pass that in the place where it was
[52:41] said under them you are not my people
[52:44] there shall they be called the children
[52:47] of the Living God so even though men may
[52:49] have tried to write us off as Gentiles
[52:52] men of Hebrew or Jewish descent may have
[52:55] wrote off all of the Jew
[52:56] all of the Gentiles but God is saying
[52:59] that they shall be called the children
[53:02] of the Living God Isaiah is also crying
[53:05] crith concerning Israel though the
[53:08] number of the children of Israel be as
[53:10] the sand of the sea a Remnant shall be
[53:13] Savor he will finish the work and cut it
[53:15] short in righteousness because a short
[53:18] work will the Lord make upon the Earth
[53:21] and as Isaiah said before except the
[53:23] lord of the Sabbath had left us a seed
[53:26] we had been as Sodom and been made like
[53:29] un gomorah and what shall what shall we
[53:32] say then that the Gentiles which which
[53:35] followed not after the righteousness
[53:37] have attained righteousness that's
[53:39] powerful even the righteousness which is
[53:42] of Faith but Israel which followed after
[53:44] the law of righteousness hath not
[53:46] attained to the law of righteousness
[53:49] wherefore because they sought it not by
[53:52] faith but as it were by The Works of the
[53:55] law for they stumbled at The Stumbling
[53:57] Stone notice what they were stumbling at
[53:59] they were stumbling at the revelation of
[54:02] faith that they were not going to they
[54:04] were simply receiving it upon the works
[54:06] of the flesh but notice verse 33 as it
[54:09] is written behold I lay in Zion a
[54:12] stumbling stone and a rock of offense
[54:15] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[54:18] be ashamed that's a very key scripture
[54:21] to us as message Believers and behold I
[54:24] lay in Zion as some Stone a rock of
[54:27] offense and whosoever believeth on him
[54:30] shall not be ashamed if you you're very
[54:32] well studied in the message you'll know
[54:33] that that that is the scripture that
[54:36] brother brandham is there in 1962 just
[54:38] before Christmas that brother brandham
[54:40] is sitting there in his room and he and
[54:42] there begin to show the Lord begin to
[54:44] show him a vision of his final
[54:46] Commission of the third pole that there
[54:48] the Lord begin to show him and he said I
[54:51] seen those little birds those little
[54:52] Warriors he said there was no more than
[54:54] there was there was no less than five he
[54:57] said but there was no more than seven
[54:58] there but he said I begin to ask the
[55:01] Lord is this my end is this my end or
[55:03] this or is this another commission or am
[55:06] I going into a new ministry and he said
[55:09] he be to look and he said the Bible was
[55:11] opened I think it's amazing that the
[55:13] prophet would say that the Bible was
[55:15] open to Romans 9 and33 now anybody knows
[55:18] if you got Romans 9:33 there's a whole
[55:21] there's a whole bunch of pages and
[55:22] letters that are before you but the the
[55:25] the scripture that was was so
[55:26] predominant to the prophet is behold I
[55:29] lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of
[55:32] offense that whosoever believeth on him
[55:35] shall not be ashamed so it's very
[55:38] predominant that this that this what has
[55:40] been given to us is a rock of Revelation
[55:43] and I think it's very very important for
[55:45] us as message Believers that we
[55:47] recognize the hour or the very specific
[55:50] hour that we're living in as the Bride
[55:52] of Jesus Christ that it isn't just it
[55:55] wasn't just Malachi Four's day it wasn't
[55:57] just it wasn't just the prophet's day
[55:59] but it is it is the hour that we're
[56:01] living in of Revelations 10:8 through 11
[56:04] that thou must prophesy again I believe
[56:07] that it's these moments that we're
[56:09] living in that we ought to recognize and
[56:11] I don't believe that we ought to allow
[56:13] what is happening amongst the body of
[56:15] Jesus Christ to allow those things to
[56:17] just simply pass Us by and not recollect
[56:20] what's going on and just just to move on
[56:23] I want to want to speak to you tonight
[56:25] on this thought of rolling away the
[56:27] reproach and the dawning of a new day
[56:31] the rolling away of the reproach and
[56:33] it's a dawning of the new day and the
[56:35] prophet would use that that terminology
[56:37] in the second seal he said we're so glad
[56:39] today that God is revealing hisself to
[56:42] us and he said I believe that the great
[56:44] day is just beginning to Daw he said
[56:46] it's breaking in the lights the lights
[56:49] are beginning to flash the birds of
[56:51] paradise is beginning to sing in the
[56:53] Saint's heart they know that it is it
[56:55] lone now that something is going to
[56:57] happen it's just got to so the prophet
[57:00] recognized where he was setting at but
[57:03] the Church of the Living God is
[57:04] recognizing that they are living in a
[57:06] moment when the day is beginning to Dawn
[57:09] to think that where we were as a body of
[57:12] Jesus Christ 50 60 years ago but to look
[57:16] at the hour that we're living in that
[57:18] we're not just a we're not just another
[57:20] church we're not just another
[57:22] denomination we're not just another
[57:24] organism but we are physically the
[57:27] living Oracles of Jesus Christ made
[57:30] manifest in the hour and I believe that
[57:32] if God's got scripture that are laying
[57:34] there then the prophet would say in the
[57:36] message Shalom he said then we ought to
[57:38] get in the rhythm of the scripture of
[57:40] the music that if it if he said that
[57:42] Jesus is going to be here then we ought
[57:44] to get in the rhythm of that if he said
[57:47] that there's going to be a millennium
[57:48] then we ought to get in the rhythm of
[57:50] that he said there said there'll be a
[57:51] new day he said there'll be a day that
[57:53] the sun will never go down no more he
[57:56] said we'll need it no more for the lamb
[57:58] is the light of that
[58:00] City he said it's the dawning of a new
[58:03] day he said I feel it all over me right
[58:05] now to think that right now what you
[58:08] feel in the room time and time again
[58:10] it's the dawning of a new day it's not
[58:13] something that it's not something that's
[58:15] going away but it's something that Jesus
[58:18] Christ he saw in you before the
[58:20] foundation of the world but to think
[58:22] that we're living right
[58:24] here we're living right here here when
[58:26] the evening light has shined upon the
[58:29] Church of the Living God and she's not
[58:31] wondering who she is she knows who she
[58:35] is he said the light of a day where
[58:37] there is no light there is no darkness
[58:39] no Shadows no Skies no DM Dark Skies no
[58:43] midnight no Graves no flowers on the
[58:45] hillsides no funeral possessions no
[58:49] doctors no
[58:50] morg no cancer no tuberculosis no
[58:55] trouble
[58:57] it's the dawning of a new
[58:59] day he said I can feel the Rays of his
[59:02] light breaking through upon my soul the
[59:05] new day the old one is pressing away but
[59:09] there's something that is pressing you
[59:11] the light it's just the darkest right
[59:14] before the dawn and I know that darkness
[59:16] is creeping in but do you recognize what
[59:19] light is doing it's
[59:21] pressing it's pushing it's pushing the
[59:24] darkness right out of your
[59:27] life think that when the Church of the
[59:30] Living God had got to a place in Numbers
[59:32] Chapter 13 when they got to a place that
[59:35] we are that is very well known in the
[59:37] scriptures of cadesh barel which is
[59:40] known as the Judgment seat of God what
[59:42] were they at they were at a junction
[59:45] they were at a turning point as a as a
[59:47] congregation or as a church but you
[59:50] remember what the Bible said that when
[59:51] he come to them in Deuteronomy chapter 2
[59:53] and 3 and said that you have compass
[59:56] pass this mountain long enough it's time
[59:58] to turn northward they had been sitting
[1:00:00] here they had been squalling back and
[1:00:02] forth and they'd been fussing back and
[1:00:04] forth but God was going to raise a
[1:00:07] generation that was going to fully
[1:00:09] inherit when there were others that
[1:00:11] would not move into those possessions or
[1:00:14] simply said I long to be back with the
[1:00:16] garlic pots I long to be back there in
[1:00:18] Egypt but God was going to have somebody
[1:00:21] that was going to live in the hour that
[1:00:24] he had destined him to live
[1:00:26] you see they were wanting and longing to
[1:00:28] live off of yesterday's Mana they were
[1:00:31] longing for the experiences of about
[1:00:33] there in Egypt but we recognize that a
[1:00:35] prophet said that every generation has a
[1:00:38] chance at a fresh Revival and I think
[1:00:42] it's very important that we preach the
[1:00:44] message the way that the prophet
[1:00:46] preached it to us and I don't believe
[1:00:48] that there's any generation that that
[1:00:50] that needs a fresh Revival like this
[1:00:53] one if we've got Leo AA that's creeping
[1:00:56] in like it is if we see the darkness
[1:00:58] creeping in I say that we need a Revival
[1:01:01] like never before but it'll never come
[1:01:04] unless God sends it and many people are
[1:01:06] waiting for it maybe they're waiting on
[1:01:08] maybe they're waiting on just certain
[1:01:10] situations but I want to say this to the
[1:01:12] Church of the Living God you're in
[1:01:16] it this is the bride's Revival the
[1:01:20] return of the spirit of the Lord that
[1:01:22] pillar fire that stood over our Prophet
[1:01:25] it was a to this generation that Elohim
[1:01:28] is now back with his bride's body and he
[1:01:31] has come back in full
[1:01:35] manifestation that's why we can sit here
[1:01:38] under the revealing of the son of man
[1:01:40] and know that God has called us to a
[1:01:42] higher place he didn't call us to go
[1:01:45] back to some wiggle tail experience he
[1:01:48] called us he called us for fresh manner
[1:01:51] that's why he would say that you're a
[1:01:53] high priest because a high priest didn't
[1:01:56] have to Wi live off of the yesterday's
[1:01:59] experience but they could go in there
[1:02:01] and feast off off of the same om fo that
[1:02:05] Moses and Aaron ate off of because in
[1:02:08] the presence of the shika Glory the Mana
[1:02:11] never wasted it never got old that's why
[1:02:14] you got to have a generational blessing
[1:02:17] of the Holy
[1:02:19] Ghost you can't live off your mama's
[1:02:21] experience you can't live off of your
[1:02:23] daddy's experience you can't live off
[1:02:25] your Granddaddy's experience you've got
[1:02:27] to have a fresh call a fresh experience
[1:02:30] a fresh anointing a fresh Pentecostal
[1:02:35] experience where you go back to where
[1:02:38] the Bible the Bible becomes alive
[1:02:42] again Hallelujah when you go to look
[1:02:45] over in Joshua chapter 5 you begin to
[1:02:48] see that it was
[1:02:49] time it was time to roll away the
[1:02:52] reproach it was time because you notice
[1:02:54] the scene that we're in that the
[1:02:56] Israelites had just crossed over the
[1:02:58] river they crossed over in the promised
[1:03:01] land and they were leaving all of Egypt
[1:03:04] behind them because you can't pass
[1:03:06] through
[1:03:07] death and carry things with
[1:03:10] you come on somebody you can't pass
[1:03:13] through death and carry things with you
[1:03:15] so Joshua this was a sign unto them to
[1:03:18] raise up Stones as a memorial that we
[1:03:22] pass through these Waters that when
[1:03:24] there raises up a generation that says
[1:03:26] that that that's her days gone by bring
[1:03:28] them back to these Stones bring them
[1:03:30] back to this moment bring them back to
[1:03:33] this time but Joshua had to go further
[1:03:36] because the word of the Lord said unto
[1:03:38] him take your sharp knives and
[1:03:41] circumcised those that had not been
[1:03:44] circumcised so he raising up a
[1:03:46] generation he's raising up a generation
[1:03:49] that was not a
[1:03:51] part that was not a part of the old
[1:03:54] generation
[1:03:56] but notice when they passed through the
[1:03:57] waters when they walked through and they
[1:03:59] crossed over notice what it was he was
[1:04:02] literally rolling away the reproach of
[1:04:05] Egypt he was rolling away their shame he
[1:04:08] was rolling away their bondage of their
[1:04:10] past when the old generation wouldn't
[1:04:13] commit to the message God was raising up
[1:04:16] somebody that would commit to the
[1:04:18] message what did he do he literally rode
[1:04:21] away the reproach of Egypt so let me say
[1:04:24] this to you the reproach of Egypt is not
[1:04:27] on you no more the reproach of sin is
[1:04:31] not on you no more the reproach of
[1:04:33] slavery is not on you no more the
[1:04:36] reproach of Oppression is not on you no
[1:04:39] more the reproach of idolatry is not on
[1:04:42] you no
[1:04:44] more the reproach of the bondage to sin
[1:04:48] is not on you no
[1:04:51] more what is it it's somebody that's
[1:04:54] raising up a new generation
[1:04:56] that is fully going to manifest what is
[1:04:58] laying there what Abraham
[1:05:03] saw I know we're in spiritual warfare
[1:05:05] but let's fight tonight when when when
[1:05:07] the rest of the generation would not
[1:05:09] rise up and Conquer there was going to
[1:05:11] be somebody that would fully inherit
[1:05:14] that would fully
[1:05:16] possess the Bible said that the old
[1:05:19] generation them old Warriors or the men
[1:05:21] of War they were consumed because they
[1:05:23] would not obey the voice of the Lord L
[1:05:26] and the Bible said that God would not
[1:05:28] even show them the
[1:05:31] land but he raised up their children in
[1:05:34] their stad now notice God's got a word
[1:05:37] that is going to be fulfilled is that
[1:05:39] right he's got a word that's going to be
[1:05:40] fulfilled and the Bible said in Isaiah
[1:05:42] chapter 55 and I believe it's verse 11
[1:05:45] that my word will not return unto me
[1:05:48] void but it will accomplish that which I
[1:05:51] pleas it to do so God's got a word for
[1:05:53] this generation for them to raise up
[1:05:56] under it but there was old Warriors that
[1:05:58] would not fully commit to the
[1:06:01] message so God was going to raise up a
[1:06:04] generation let me make this very clear
[1:06:06] the word was going to be
[1:06:08] fulfilled it didn't matter who was
[1:06:10] against it it didn't matter how many
[1:06:12] critics rose up and said it wasn't right
[1:06:14] he was going to fulfill that commission
[1:06:17] or or what the word of the Lord was
[1:06:19] saying for the vision of the
[1:06:23] hour let me break the stigma right here
[1:06:26] it's ain't doing away with old people in
[1:06:27] the
[1:06:30] message it's ain't doing away in just
[1:06:32] lifting up our young kids and trying to
[1:06:34] put the emphasis on them and just saying
[1:06:36] it's for the older people they have no
[1:06:38] part in it no more that's absolutely
[1:06:40] contrary to scripture it's not absolute
[1:06:42] that's not it at all but what this is
[1:06:45] recognizing is that you're under a new
[1:06:47] commission you can't live back there you
[1:06:50] can't live back there you're under a new
[1:06:54] Commission

[1:09:41] reproach I've rolled away your
[1:09:45] reproach
[1:09:47] man feels good don't
[1:09:50] it because you can't carry over the
[1:09:53] world into this land

[1:10:03] into our New
[1:10:05] Jerusalem come on somebody you can't
[1:10:08] carry your habits over into the land of
[1:10:10] the Holy Ghost you can't carry over your
[1:10:12] sin and expect to be an overcomer in
[1:10:15] this land of the message of the hour you
[1:10:18] can't carry it over here and have full
[1:10:20] benefits in the
[1:10:22] land notice what brother random said and
[1:10:24] think of man's filter he said' when you
[1:10:26] come into this world you were born in
[1:10:27] sin he said you didn't even come here
[1:10:29] with a fighting chance he said you were
[1:10:32] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:10:33] the world speaking lies he said within
[1:10:35] your own Spirit the desire to sin a
[1:10:39] lover of sin because you were born in
[1:10:40] sin you didn't have a chance he said but
[1:10:42] down inside of you somewhere here you
[1:10:45] come there was something in there that
[1:10:47] begin to draw he said if you know he
[1:10:50] said it was something that told you
[1:10:52] there was a god somewhere and you read
[1:10:55] his word then you took the church then
[1:10:58] you took to the church you took their
[1:11:00] ideas when you was told better than you
[1:11:02] never you never used to have a you never
[1:11:04] used a thinking man's filter he said but
[1:11:07] when you use God's filter right which is
[1:11:10] a thinking man's filter because all the
[1:11:13] other filters pass away he said but mine
[1:11:15] shall not and when you take God's filter
[1:11:18] and draw your life your desires he said
[1:11:21] if you draw your desires through God's
[1:11:23] filter a thinking man's fil
[1:11:25] he said there's nothing left but the
[1:11:28] Holy
[1:11:30] Ghost there's nothing left but the Holy
[1:11:34] Ghost let me say this the only thing
[1:11:36] that can pass through the the thinking
[1:11:39] man's filter is the
[1:11:42] word he said and when you draw your
[1:11:44] desires through God's filter there's
[1:11:47] nothing left but the Holy Ghost he said
[1:11:49] now if you want the evidence of the Holy
[1:11:52] Ghost there it
[1:11:54] is
[1:11:58] people want to ask you what's brother
[1:11:59] Andrew's stance on the evidence of the
[1:12:02] Holy Ghost I'll tell you exactly what it
[1:12:04] is right
[1:12:06] here if you can draw your desires of Le
[1:12:09] osia through your experience and still
[1:12:13] say that you're a
[1:12:14] Christian you've got the wrong
[1:12:17] filter but if you've got the right
[1:12:19] desire and you've got everything align
[1:12:22] right and the only thing that can pass
[1:12:24] through that filter is the word of God
[1:12:26] that's the
[1:12:27] evidence the evidence is not speaking in
[1:12:31] tongues the
[1:12:33] evidence I'm going break a spirit right
[1:12:35] here the evidence is being able to say
[1:12:38] Amen to every word of
[1:12:43] God I don't care if you can scream in
[1:12:46] tongues crow in
[1:12:48] tongues that goes with it but the
[1:12:51] evidence of the Holy Ghost is being able
[1:12:54] to yourself and come into full obedience
[1:12:58] to the Token
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:02] message
[1:13:05] Hallelujah that's it when that soul of
[1:13:08] yours will line with the word of God in
[1:13:10] every respect it shows that you draw
[1:13:13] your life through a thinking man's
[1:13:15] filter it's God's filter now we we now
[1:13:19] we look all the way back in their
[1:13:21] Journey it was faith that led them out
[1:13:23] of Egypt it was faith that applied the
[1:13:25] blood to the door it was faith that led
[1:13:28] them out and it was faith that was going
[1:13:30] to lead them in notice what the Bible
[1:13:33] said in Romans 4:11 and heed speaking of
[1:13:36] Abraham that he received the sign of
[1:13:38] circumcision a seal of the righteousness
[1:13:41] of Faith which he had yet being
[1:13:44] uncircumcised notice his faith he had
[1:13:46] yet been uncircumcised that he might be
[1:13:49] the father of all them that
[1:13:53] believe that a shut
[1:13:55] how to such illegalism down on't it
[1:13:58] though they be not circumcised that
[1:14:00] righteousness might be imputed under
[1:14:02] them also verse 13 for the promise that
[1:14:06] he should be the heir of the world was
[1:14:09] not to Abraham or to his seed through
[1:14:11] the law but through the righteousness of
[1:14:15] Faith through the righteousness of Faith
[1:14:19] was all of this granted it was Mercy to
[1:14:22] you and God extends Mercy to who he
[1:14:25] wants to extend
[1:14:27] Mercy is that
[1:14:29] right you remember when brother Ram was
[1:14:31] sitting there and the Lord speaks to him
[1:14:34] while he's up there hunting said the he
[1:14:37] tells him be careful tells him be
[1:14:39] careful he said Satan's got a trap for
[1:14:42] you out there he didn't know what it was
[1:14:44] but he come back there he come back
[1:14:46] there and started preaching that meeting
[1:14:48] started preaching that meeting and and
[1:14:51] he said all of a sudden he said he said
[1:14:52] there was two people out there trying to
[1:14:54] act like he said they was out there and
[1:14:56] he said they was making love in the
[1:14:58] congregation and he said he said he he
[1:15:00] said there they were and he said he said
[1:15:02] they in the spirit of the Lord begin to
[1:15:03] say to me there it is there's that trap
[1:15:06] there notice brother random said that
[1:15:09] the whole entire congregation begin to
[1:15:11] hush that there begin to begin a holy
[1:15:13] hush and the spirit of the Lord told him
[1:15:15] said they're in your hand do with them
[1:15:18] what you
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:20] want and he said I forgive you
[1:15:25] he said because he knew what was
[1:15:27] coming he knew what was coming he said
[1:15:30] he so he hadn't he he had to see what I
[1:15:34] would say about
[1:15:35] it do you recognize that God is the god
[1:15:39] that extends Mercy to whom he wants to
[1:15:41] extend Mercy Jacob have I loved and Esau
[1:15:45] have I hated all Israel is not
[1:15:48] Israel so just because they look the
[1:15:51] part does not make them the part but
[1:15:54] what determines the
[1:15:56] part is the Jean seed of
[1:16:00] God oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:03] to think that right here in this room
[1:16:06] it's the same power it's the same power
[1:16:09] that is operating all of this room that
[1:16:11] Benjamin Franklin grabbed a hold of when
[1:16:14] he's out there on that stormy night he's
[1:16:17] out there with a kite in his hand got a
[1:16:19] key down at the end of it running down
[1:16:21] into a bottle it's right here in the
[1:16:23] room
[1:16:25] it's right here in the room brother
[1:16:27] Randall but he couldn't fully tap into
[1:16:30] it but it took a man by the name of
[1:16:32] Thomas
[1:16:33] Edison that was led that was led and
[1:16:37] anointed for the hour that he was living
[1:16:39] in and he tried night after night took
[1:16:42] wire after wire 10 thousands after 10
[1:16:44] thousands of
[1:16:46] times people made fun of him they
[1:16:49] scoffed at him but it called him crazy
[1:16:52] but it just kept on
[1:16:53] going
[1:16:55] because he believed that what Benjamin
[1:16:57] Franklin could stand out there and
[1:16:59] scream I've got it he believed that he
[1:17:02] could harness that
[1:17:07] power Thomas Edison said he said I
[1:17:09] didn't find 10,000 10,000 ways to fail
[1:17:13] he said I found 10,000 ways to show me
[1:17:16] how I could
[1:17:19] succeed let me tell you you may have
[1:17:21] failed you may have failed it may have
[1:17:24] been 10 thousand times but it just
[1:17:27] showed you where you could succeed at
[1:17:30] that power that's given you overcoming
[1:17:33] power has been here all that time to
[1:17:37] think that the power that is operating
[1:17:39] this building has been here ever since
[1:17:42] Adam walked on the Earth but it took
[1:17:45] somebody blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:48] somebody to harness it and control it
[1:17:51] what did Edison do he simply moved
[1:17:54] brother sanon in the law of electricity
[1:17:57] and he made and found a
[1:18:00] current that power that fell on the day
[1:18:03] of Pentecost had always been here but
[1:18:06] Peter stood up there and he found that
[1:18:09] Holy power that was on the inside of
[1:18:12] Jesus now that same power that fell up
[1:18:15] there in the upper room it's
[1:18:18] here come on somebody if it did healings
[1:18:21] in Jesus day then it'll produce healings
[1:18:24] right now now that same
[1:18:29] power what do you shook up about that
[1:18:32] same pow is in the room it doesn't
[1:18:34] matter whether you see it whether you
[1:18:35] feel it whether whether you feel a
[1:18:37] condition of rolling of of your chills
[1:18:39] running down your body it's in the
[1:18:42] room it's in the
[1:18:45] room it's in the room let me say it like
[1:18:48] this your prodal that do not look like
[1:18:51] they are coming the power to release
[1:18:54] them the key of it is Faith and it's in
[1:18:57] the
[1:18:58] room the key to unlock the Rapture is
[1:19:01] your faith and it's in the
[1:19:06] room something is coming unhinged in
[1:19:10] here something's breaking something's
[1:19:13] breaking because you choose you choose
[1:19:15] which side you want to be on you either
[1:19:17] choose Faith or you choose out and we
[1:19:20] recognize that where we're living at is
[1:19:22] the hour of the overcomer
[1:19:26] notice notice that God didn't just raise
[1:19:28] us up to see if he could do it he had a
[1:19:30] purpose in doing
[1:19:31] it is that right man didn't create the
[1:19:34] automobile just to see if he could do it
[1:19:36] he had a purpose in doing it and God
[1:19:38] didn't just simply make you to see if he
[1:19:40] could do it he had a purpose in doing it
[1:19:43] and notice when when when when when
[1:19:46] Isaiah or excuse me Zachariah when he
[1:19:48] sitting there in Zechariah Chapter 4 and
[1:19:51] you can see there that the Lord begins
[1:19:54] to show Zachariah all the way into our
[1:19:57] age he begins to show him the seven
[1:19:59] Church ages he begins to show him the
[1:20:02] olive branches and all of those things
[1:20:04] and he begins to speak to him in
[1:20:06] Zechariah 4 and verse 6 if you don't
[1:20:09] mind I'm might turn around cuz I ain't
[1:20:12] got glasses he back here then he
[1:20:14] answered and spake unto me saying this
[1:20:16] is the word of the Lord unto zeruel
[1:20:18] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:20:22] my spirit saith the Lord of H verse 7
[1:20:26] Where Art Thou oh great Mountain who who
[1:20:29] art thou oh great Mountain before Zer
[1:20:31] Rubble Thou shalt become a plain and he
[1:20:34] shall bring forth The Headstone thereof
[1:20:37] shouting crying shoutings crying Grace
[1:20:42] Grace Uno it what did William brandham
[1:20:45] say in this generation it's a message of
[1:20:48] Grace but notice notice the same one
[1:20:52] that is standing there in Zachariah chap
[1:20:54] CH 4 when you look over into Revelations
[1:20:57] chapter
[1:21:00] 1 when you look into Revelations chapter
[1:21:03] 1 and you begin to see there I'm just
[1:21:06] going to quote it well you begin to see
[1:21:08] one that is standing in the midst maybe
[1:21:11] verse 13 He begin to stand there in the
[1:21:14] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:21:16] there standing one like unto the son of
[1:21:19] man what is it it's the same one in
[1:21:23] Zechariah Chapter for it's not by might
[1:21:26] it's not by power that same
[1:21:30] power that same power is standing right
[1:21:37] here hallelujah he didn't leave you in
[1:21:40] 1965 that same
[1:21:44] power that is going to press you through
[1:21:47] get you in the Rapture make you an
[1:21:49] overcomer give you a body change that
[1:21:52] Holy power that AR ra you out of the
[1:21:55] Grave one of these days that Holy
[1:21:58] power is in the room and he's walking in
[1:22:02] the midst of the
[1:22:08] church
[1:22:10] Hallelujah notice notice what the seven
[1:22:14] when brother Bram starts taking the
[1:22:15] seals notice he steps into he goes into
[1:22:19] full operation of the Elijah
[1:22:23] Ministry no notice what he starts laying
[1:22:26] out there in the seals he starts saying
[1:22:29] that the opening and the breaking of
[1:22:31] those seals that the ministry of the
[1:22:33] seventh angel is the mysteries of God so
[1:22:37] it's literally his ministry to break the
[1:22:40] seals that'll release you from every
[1:22:44] Hound of
[1:22:47] hell so you're not just under some man
[1:22:50] Ministry you're feeding on the son of
[1:22:53] man so you recognize what superpower
[1:22:57] that you're under you're not under
[1:23:00] you're not under a Creed you're not
[1:23:02] under denomination you're not under
[1:23:04] organization you're under an anointing
[1:23:07] you're under an anointing of the age
[1:23:10] it's an eagle anointing and it's
[1:23:12] literally this messenger this seventh
[1:23:14] angel his ministry is the mysteries of
[1:23:19] God what makes you so different brother
[1:23:22] Andrew this power this spirit this
[1:23:25] message you cannot separate the message
[1:23:28] from the
[1:23:29] messenger and you can't separate me from
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:38] message what did it do it literally
[1:23:41] rolled the reproach off of
[1:23:44] you now a lot of you been born right
[1:23:46] here you've been right Born right here
[1:23:48] in the message you've been you've been
[1:23:49] raised in diapers right
[1:23:51] here that's scary thought
[1:23:56] that when I was getting married Carly
[1:23:58] was a baby pretty much a baby in this
[1:24:02] church but to think about there's a lot
[1:24:04] of other babies here too she was in my
[1:24:08] eyesight but to think about it that a
[1:24:10] lot of you come out of
[1:24:13] denominations maybe maybe you didn't as
[1:24:15] a family but maybe your forefathers or
[1:24:17] your grandfathers they came out of
[1:24:19] denominations but to think where where
[1:24:21] the message has literally has literally
[1:24:25] roded that reproach off of you what do
[1:24:28] you mean brother Andrew you find
[1:24:30] somebody that was that was brought up in
[1:24:32] the Catholic
[1:24:33] Church they literally the message
[1:24:36] literally rolled that ideology off of
[1:24:38] them you take somebody that was raised
[1:24:41] in a church of Christ or a Church of God
[1:24:43] where they was quiet as as a church
[1:24:45] mouse on Sunday morning they didn't
[1:24:47] believe in anything they didn't believe
[1:24:48] in anything like this this message
[1:24:51] literally rolled that off of them what
[1:24:54] did it do he gave you a new identity now
[1:24:57] let me come back to you that were raised
[1:25:00] in the message you had to have an
[1:25:02] experience for yourself just because you
[1:25:06] sat here and under a great ministry does
[1:25:08] not change does not say that you don't
[1:25:10] need the reproach Road off of you you
[1:25:12] need it more than a lot of people
[1:25:15] because people that are raised in the
[1:25:16] message sometimes get a higher thinking
[1:25:18] about themselves and think that they're
[1:25:20] okay because they're under the message
[1:25:22] of the hour sometimes them message
[1:25:26] so-called Believers are more dangerous
[1:25:29] than a Pentecostal or a Church of Christ
[1:25:31] out there because they got a
[1:25:34] spirit a religious spirit on them that
[1:25:37] is harder to break than a prostitute on
[1:25:40] a
[1:25:42] street felt
[1:25:45] that oh yeah I know what I'm talking
[1:25:48] about and I'm getting into some Waters
[1:25:49] here but I want you to know that this
[1:25:51] message literally rolled the reproach
[1:25:54] off of you because just like it came to
[1:25:57] Ruth just like when she was a moabitas
[1:26:00] and had the identity of a moabit what
[1:26:03] did this Mighty Man of wealth do he rode
[1:26:07] the very title of a moabit off of her
[1:26:10] and placed her as the ancestor of
[1:26:13] [Applause]
[1:26:15] David what did it do when the Mighty Man
[1:26:18] of wealth kicked off his shoe what
[1:26:21] happened up there on the cross when
[1:26:23] Christ kicked off the rags of
[1:26:25] righteousness and said I'll die for them
[1:26:28] I'll go to the cross for
[1:26:30] them you couldn't pay your sin you
[1:26:33] couldn't get yourself out of a mud hole
[1:26:36] but God rich in Mercy said I'll take the
[1:26:39] pain for
[1:26:46] them
[1:26:49] Hallelujah notice in this message of
[1:26:52] Grace he said I want you to notice
[1:26:55] he never said that he shall bring forth
[1:26:56] a Cornerstone that he shall bring forth
[1:26:58] a headstone he said we know that the
[1:27:01] scripture says that Jesus is the Chief
[1:27:04] Cornerstone and he's also the headstone
[1:27:07] he said now but if we think for a minute
[1:27:09] he said that the seven Church age
[1:27:10] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:27:13] the children back to the fathers he said
[1:27:16] in other words and now catch this he
[1:27:18] said in other words rebuild the church
[1:27:20] again under the power of the spirit
[1:27:27] you catch it that the seven Church
[1:27:29] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:27:32] the children back to the fathers in
[1:27:35] other words rebuild the church again
[1:27:37] under the power of the spirit not by
[1:27:39] power not by might but by my spirit
[1:27:42] sayith the Lord not by organization not
[1:27:46] by denomination but by the holy spirit
[1:27:48] of God will bring forth a church in the
[1:27:51] last
[1:27:52] days notice what the message did it
[1:27:56] broke the denominational barriers that
[1:27:59] held you back from being who you were
[1:28:02] meant to be because if you plant a
[1:28:04] denominational seed you get
[1:28:06] denominational tears you get unbelief in
[1:28:09] your mix but notice the hour that you're
[1:28:12] living in this is
[1:28:14] restoration this is the restoration of
[1:28:18] the Bride tree that you're not a part
[1:28:21] Hallelujah the canker worm made it down
[1:28:23] the P worm ate it down the Locust ate it
[1:28:27] down but in the last days my people will
[1:28:30] never be ashamed and I will restore thus
[1:28:33] saith the
[1:28:35] Lord hallelujah that's what Peter got a
[1:28:39] hold of he had an
[1:28:42] identity he had an identity as a cussing
[1:28:45] preacher denying the Christ three times
[1:28:48] but when he got up there on the day of
[1:28:51] Pentecost he grabbed a hold of something
[1:28:53] and said this is that that was
[1:28:56] prophesied by the prophet Joel he was no
[1:28:59] longer identified no more as a cusser
[1:29:01] but he was identified as a message
[1:29:10] preacher that's what John said when the
[1:29:13] voice came to him in Revelations 22 and
[1:29:16] 10 he said and he saith unto me seal not
[1:29:21] the sayings of the prophecy of this book
[1:29:23] for the time is at hand what was it
[1:29:26] don't seal it up I got a people that
[1:29:29] need this I got a people that's living
[1:29:32] in the
[1:29:36] hour roll it away them denominations
[1:29:39] will never get you out of
[1:29:41] here there's good people out there I got
[1:29:45] good friends out there but that
[1:29:47] denomination that organization that
[1:29:50] man's spirit will never put you in a
[1:29:53] rapture
[1:29:55] that's why when John is standing there
[1:29:58] and he catches the Revelation said seal
[1:30:00] it up not don't seal it up there's a
[1:30:03] people that's coming in the last day
[1:30:05] that will receive the prophecy of this
[1:30:07] book they will be the manifestation of
[1:30:09] Revelations 10 they
[1:30:12] will the spirit of Prophecy has returned
[1:30:16] to the Church of the Living
[1:30:22] God now when
[1:30:24] Jesus I'm going to turn real quick
[1:30:28] here when Jesus
[1:30:30] comes and he spent some he spent some
[1:30:34] time with his family he spent some time
[1:30:37] with his friends he he showed them he
[1:30:40] brings the children unto
[1:30:42] himself he heals a leper he does many
[1:30:47] miracles but when Jesus walks into his
[1:30:52] hometown and they ask him to read of the
[1:30:57] book what's he doing he's moving into
[1:31:00] full operation of his
[1:31:04] ministry he was not just a friend no
[1:31:09] more come on somebody he was not just a
[1:31:12] childhood friend no more he was no
[1:31:14] longer just the boy that was raised
[1:31:16] right here he was no longer the man that
[1:31:18] knew the Torah he was not just that man
[1:31:20] no more but he was taken on a role
[1:31:24] and you go to read in Luke chapter 4 and
[1:31:27] you could see that when he takes his
[1:31:29] turn that the that the book is delivered
[1:31:33] of him and he takes a book and the Bible
[1:31:37] said that when he had opened the
[1:31:41] book when he had opened the book he
[1:31:45] found the place where it was
[1:31:48] written go ahead says or brother
[1:31:51] whoever's running it that the spirit the
[1:31:54] Lord is upon me because he has anointed
[1:31:56] me to preach to the gospel to the poor
[1:31:58] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:32:01] to preach Deliverance to the captives
[1:32:03] and the recovering of the sight to the
[1:32:04] blind to set at Liberty them that are
[1:32:09] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[1:32:13] the Lord to think the position that he's
[1:32:17] taken they waited 49 years and 11 months
[1:32:23] and all the way through they waited for
[1:32:25] that Jubilee trumpet but Jesus is
[1:32:28] signaling to all of the Jews that your
[1:32:33] hour of freedom is
[1:32:37] here hallelujah your hour of freedom is
[1:32:42] here and when he had finished the
[1:32:45] reading he closed a book and sat
[1:32:51] down and all eyes are on him
[1:32:55] but he left something for this day
[1:32:56] brother
[1:32:57] Chris all eyes are on him and he said
[1:33:01] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:33:04] your ears the one that they was raised
[1:33:07] up with the one that they knew was now
[1:33:10] fully taken in operation the ministry of
[1:33:14] the Messiah the one that Moses thought
[1:33:16] of was now
[1:33:19] here just like when Abraham saw them 800
[1:33:23] years before when he saw his seed fully
[1:33:27] operating in the land of
[1:33:30] Canaan they were walking in the
[1:33:34] vision they couldn't handle this brother
[1:33:37] Doug these were some religious
[1:33:40] dudes these were the so-called so-called
[1:33:43] message Elite of the
[1:33:46] day take it back it's blasphemy what
[1:33:49] you've
[1:33:50] said and they take him out
[1:33:55] they take him out said if you don't
[1:33:57] repent of this you know what the law
[1:33:59] says about
[1:34:03] it you know what the law says about
[1:34:06] it they take him out to the edge of a
[1:34:18] cliff you take him out to an edge of
[1:34:20] cliff and they're going to cast him out
[1:34:22] you can imagine where he's at
[1:34:24] he's got his back against
[1:34:27] death he's got his back against death
[1:34:29] he's got his back against everything
[1:34:32] that is going to kill his ministry but
[1:34:34] his ministry was far from
[1:34:37] over they were pushing him to a
[1:34:40] spot but the Bible said that he simply
[1:34:43] walked through the midst of them because
[1:34:45] his time was not up yet he simply let me
[1:34:48] say this to
[1:34:51] you we may have had our back pushed
[1:34:54] against the wall for Gospel Lighthouse
[1:34:56] the message of the hour may have had its
[1:34:58] back pushed against the wall but it
[1:35:00] ain't our time yet but when every son
[1:35:04] has come to full maturity sister Katie

[1:41:39] sword Christ didn't come here just to
[1:41:41] pet the devil
[1:41:44] around he didn't come here just so you
[1:41:46] can live in your filthiness and stay in
[1:41:48] your filthiness he literally came here
[1:41:50] to destroy the works of the enemy
[1:41:54] you go on down in that message you'll
[1:41:55] find that William brandham said that the
[1:41:58] body is to do the same thing to destroy
[1:42:02] the works of the enemy there'll be a
[1:42:03] church of the word they'll be born of
[1:42:05] the word there'll be a virgin born from
[1:42:08] the word that you are
[1:42:10] literally here to destroy the works of
[1:42:15] the enemy now the enemy come to kill
[1:42:17] steal and destroy but Jesus said I come
[1:42:19] to give life and life more
[1:42:25] abundantly now you take this for what
[1:42:27] you
[1:42:28] will but I had this quota in my
[1:42:32] message for
[1:42:34] today I wake up this morning I send it
[1:42:38] to my
[1:42:40] family and a brother sends me this same
[1:42:43] quote by the church email and I I
[1:42:46] about I held myself together all
[1:42:49] day brother Prophet said he said I might
[1:42:51] could stop here he said if I had time to
[1:42:54] give you just a little tip he said
[1:42:57] sometimes you might be sitting out there
[1:42:58] with cancer or he said you might be
[1:43:00] sitting out there with a disease he said
[1:43:01] you think why me being a Christian would
[1:43:05] be in this
[1:43:06] way why would I be sitting like this if
[1:43:08] I'm a Christian sometimes God lets the
[1:43:11] things get so dark that you can't see up
[1:43:13] around or anywhere else and there he
[1:43:16] comes and makes a way through it for you
[1:43:18] that you might say this day this
[1:43:20] scripture is being fulfilled that he
[1:43:22] promised to do he said he let the Hebrew
[1:43:25] children walk right in the fiery furnace
[1:43:27] and said that our God is able to Deliver
[1:43:30] Us from this fire in the furnace he said
[1:43:32] but nevertheless we'll not bow down to
[1:43:35] your image he said when they walked out
[1:43:38] there he said no smell of the Furnace
[1:43:40] rather upon them he said they could have
[1:43:42] said this day this scripture is
[1:43:46] fulfilled in your ears that's exactly
[1:43:49] what Joshua stood out there when he
[1:43:51] grabbed a hold of it and the rest of
[1:43:53] them 10 spies their heart failed but he
[1:43:56] looked out there and said this day this
[1:43:59] scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:44:04] ears
[1:44:06] Hallelujah he said the Pentecostal
[1:44:11] church is in a lay osing
[1:44:15] condition he said oh they still jumping
[1:44:17] holler and carrying on when the music is
[1:44:20] beating he said but when the Music Stops
[1:44:22] a beating or the beat neck music stop or
[1:44:24] some of them play and calling it
[1:44:26] Christianity and he said whenever that
[1:44:28] stops all the glory is
[1:44:33] gone come on Shout with me real
[1:44:39] quick he said but if it's real praise of
[1:44:43] God there isn't enough whistles enough
[1:44:45] power in the world to stop it he said
[1:44:48] when it really comes from God it don't
[1:44:50] take music to beat it up it takes the
[1:44:52] spirit of God to come down on it he said
[1:44:54] that's what does
[1:44:57] it that's what I've taught you here
[1:45:00] that's what this message T to you it
[1:45:02] ain't the music while you're shouting it
[1:45:04] ain't the it ain't the music I know we
[1:45:07] Shout with it but I can shout without it
[1:45:11] [Applause]
[1:45:19] too this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:45:23] in your
[1:45:25] ears well it's just a bunch of work up
[1:45:28] down there Full Gospel
[1:45:30] Lighthouse I got a word for you come and
[1:45:41] see they ain't one Li a music playing
[1:45:44] right
[1:45:45] now when you preach a message the bride
[1:45:48] will rise through her
[1:45:51] feet come on somebody
[1:45:54] I'll dance with you all the way David 17
[1:45:57] miles
[1:45:58] backwards but what really Thrills my
[1:46:00] heart [ __ ] is when I see the word of
[1:46:03] God doing what it said that it would do
[1:46:05] in this generation that'll make you
[1:46:07] shout it'll make you scream it'll make
[1:46:09] you dance it'll make you holler it'll
[1:46:11] make you speak in tongues when you see
[1:46:20] yourself we had a prominent man in the
[1:46:24] message that come to this
[1:46:29] church said I just come here to see if
[1:46:32] it's real or
[1:46:35] not because a lot of people see things
[1:46:37] on the internet and don't have a
[1:46:40] clue because they ain't never been in a
[1:46:42] situation because churches don't believe
[1:46:45] in preaching the message in its
[1:46:51] entirety
[1:46:54] not
[1:46:56] every now every service ain't going to
[1:46:58] be like that shouting and screaming and
[1:47:00] speaking in tongues and dancing all over
[1:47:01] the building I'm the first to recognize
[1:47:03] it I'm the first to identify it but I
[1:47:06] believe you can have
[1:47:08] it I believe you can have it in every
[1:47:11] single service if you set the right kind
[1:47:13] of atmosphere I believe that you can
[1:47:15] create such an atmosphere that sons that
[1:47:18] are away from God can literally be
[1:47:21] pulled by the atmos spere that you
[1:47:24] create in this
[1:47:27] building well it ain't just prominent
[1:47:29] people in the message it's just want to
[1:47:31] come and see it it's our prodal out
[1:47:34] there that don't know anything that's
[1:47:35] going on but there's somebody in this
[1:47:37] room that has created a place where the
[1:47:40] king of glory has felt welcome to
[1:47:45] come now y'all y'all hang with me I'm
[1:47:47] going I'm going to go through some lard
[1:47:49] but we going to get to some real meat
[1:47:50] here because we are coming to an hour
[1:47:54] where where Joshua that we're here under
[1:47:56] a Joshua commission where we are rolling
[1:47:59] away where every one of us have Egypt on
[1:48:02] us we all have our Egypt we all have
[1:48:06] past sins we all have mistakes we all
[1:48:08] have failures that haunt us and keep us
[1:48:10] from fully experiencing God's blessings
[1:48:13] things that will literally Rob the power
[1:48:16] away from the
[1:48:18] church but that ain't your
[1:48:21] identity
[1:48:24] God is able say it with me God is able
[1:48:28] to roll away my
[1:48:29] reproach he's able to forgive my sins
[1:48:33] he's able to roll away and cleanse me of
[1:48:36] all my unrighteousness and he's
[1:48:40] able if he could get Mary Magdalene when
[1:48:43] she was a woman that was ostracized from
[1:48:46] the economy of God and give her a new
[1:48:49] identity that she's the first one to see
[1:48:52] him on Resurrection
[1:48:54] [Applause]

[1:48:58] your church anity I don't need your
[1:49:00] so-called tradition I don't need your

[1:49:43] ground until you roll everything off of

[1:50:11] the
[1:50:12] ground trying to get rolling on the
[1:50:16] ground until they literally rolled the
[1:50:19] reproach right off of
[1:50:21] them
[1:50:24] what happened where'd you get that name
[1:50:26] Holy Rollers from you literally rode the
[1:50:30] reproach right off of
[1:50:32] you what happened with Hannah when she
[1:50:35] was out there when others mocked her
[1:50:37] when they when her when her husband's
[1:50:40] other wife was mocking her because she
[1:50:42] didn't have a child and she was
[1:50:45] reproached amongst her own Community
[1:50:49] when she got up there and she got
[1:50:51] herself s so drunk under prayer that the
[1:50:56] priest thought she was drunk on strong
[1:50:57] drink but she'd just come under the
[1:51:00] atmosphere of
[1:51:02] prayer that she literally got into such
[1:51:05] a
[1:51:08] spot that prayer rolled her reproach off
[1:51:13] of
[1:51:16] her
[1:51:17] okay okay if I share
[1:51:21] this we're here
[1:51:24] 3 weeks
[1:51:27] ago 3 weeks ago we had one of them
[1:51:32] meetings and our pastor stood right
[1:51:36] here and just the word of the Lord came
[1:51:38] to him said it's a blockage I said it to
[1:51:41] sister Anna it's a
[1:51:43] blockage it's all it is it's a blockage
[1:51:46] you can get you can hear the story from
[1:51:48] her it's a blockage didn't know what the
[1:51:52] word was didn't know exactly what it was
[1:51:53] about I'm telling this story because
[1:51:55] some people think when you tell your own
[1:51:57] stories that you're trying to lift
[1:51:58] yourself up so I'm telling his story so
[1:52:00] he ain't lifting your up I'm lifting him
[1:52:01] up and I'm not lifting him up I'm
[1:52:03] lifting the god inside of him
[1:52:06] up
[1:52:09] hey you're his son though I'm bigger
[1:52:12] than that I'm a son of almighty God
[1:52:15] before I was Ron Spencer son but the
[1:52:18] word said it's just a blockage she goes
[1:52:21] to the doctors
[1:52:23] and it's a
[1:52:25] blockage that
[1:52:27] is that has been preventing life from
[1:52:31] happening but because of science doctors
[1:52:36] literally rode the massage Rod the

[1:52:49] way what is this message doing

[1:52:55] there was sin in your life but the
[1:52:58] message roll the blockage out of your
[1:53:03] life it didn't just happen by happen
[1:53:06] stance that brother Tom Ray stood
[1:53:09] here said it four times now let life
[1:53:12] come let life come the blockage is gone
[1:53:16] let life
[1:53:21] come
[1:53:23] roll it away David had reproach on his
[1:53:26] life he had mistakes on his life but as
[1:53:29] when the Bible said in Psalms 51 create
[1:53:32] in me a clean heart and renew within me
[1:53:34] a right Spirit oh
[1:53:39] God roll the reproach
[1:53:44] away so I'm telling you church you can
[1:53:48] live in full
[1:53:51] victory God still got a word for you God
[1:53:55] still got a man of God that still
[1:53:57] believes that God can give a word in an
[1:53:59] hour of your
[1:54:01] desire that you can live in the freedom
[1:54:03] of Gil God that you can live in Freedom
[1:54:06] and the Victory of Gil God to let your
[1:54:09] past go let the past be the past and
[1:54:12] embrace
[1:54:14] life embrace it embrace
[1:54:19] it because God is literally raising a
[1:54:23] generation
[1:54:25] up of tower
[1:54:29] record we don't care how we get in the
[1:54:31] room do we sister Tracy we don't care if
[1:54:34] we got to tear the roof off long as I'm
[1:54:36] in the room all I want to do is be in
[1:54:38] the room when he moves and when he moves
[1:54:40] I ain't
[1:54:42] leaving well he's here so come and
[1:54:47] see come on somebody he's raising up a
[1:54:51] generation that is literally moving in
[1:54:53] to the full benefits and the full
[1:54:57] promise we don't need some promis keeper
[1:55:00] convention to keep us true we don't need
[1:55:03] some convention of men to tell us not to
[1:55:04] get on the internet and look at dirty
[1:55:06] sites we don't need somebody to hold our
[1:55:08] hands to tell us not to go down to the
[1:55:11] drugs tell us not to go down to the ABC
[1:55:13] store we don't have to have somebody to
[1:55:16] hold us and pamper us around we don't
[1:55:18] need some promisee keeper
[1:55:20] convention we got a power power that's
[1:55:23] strong enough and it's not by might and
[1:55:25] it's not by power but it's by my spirit
[1:55:28] sayith the
[1:55:32] Lord we got that kind of a
[1:55:35] word that will destroy the works of the
[1:55:39] enemy because William Brandon when he
[1:55:41] left here he left a message full of
[1:55:51] power but then the hour has come to roll
[1:55:54] away the
[1:56:00] approach well we got the word brother
[1:56:04] Andrew we don't need Miracles no
[1:56:12] more we got the word brother Andrew
[1:56:15] we're in the land of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:16] we're in the land of the message we done
[1:56:18] come to our maturity we don't need shout
[1:56:20] no more we don't need speaking in
[1:56:23] tongues no more we don't need Miracles
[1:56:26] we don't need
[1:56:28] deliverances as brother Ron said some of
[1:56:31] you
[1:56:32] do but the message come to roll away the
[1:56:39] ideas well we don't need those things no
[1:56:42] more we got the full word here so all we
[1:56:44] got to do is quote the quote and live by
[1:56:46] the letter and produce a dead generation
[1:56:49] of
[1:56:51] believers
[1:57:00] you know I think it's amazing it's
[1:57:01] spiritual religion so-called religious
[1:57:05] spirits and they can shout you down when
[1:57:07] you can sit there and you can preach and
[1:57:08] say well we don't
[1:57:14] need we're not just looking after your
[1:57:16] emotion we're not just looking after
[1:57:18] your shouting oh man they can amen you
[1:57:20] right there we don't need a mo we don't
[1:57:22] need just emotion they can amen right
[1:57:25] there they can amen you we don't just
[1:57:27] need shouting we don't just need
[1:57:29] speaking in tongues we don't just need
[1:57:31] gifts of the Spirit they can amen you
[1:57:33] right there but when it comes by their
[1:57:36] way and it really gets down on them and
[1:57:39] they sit there and say well it's too
[1:57:40] loud in the house of God and I tell you
[1:57:43] I I just you know it's not just my style
[1:57:45] and that's not just my way of receiving
[1:57:47] things and they can clamp the spirit
[1:57:51] down well we don't need them type of
[1:57:53] things no more them was days gone by
[1:57:55] back in the days back in the days of
[1:57:57] Gone by by here we
[1:58:00] are here we are in the land of full
[1:58:02] maturity brother Andrew we don't need
[1:58:04] them type of things no
[1:58:06] more well I can tell by your spirit that
[1:58:10] you are not a Bible believing kind of
[1:58:15] spirit it's amazing you can literally
[1:58:18] feel that spirit and it will clamp a
[1:58:21] service down down you can go to
[1:58:24] preaching on the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:25] Ghost and receiving it that is not just
[1:58:27] a motion that is not just a workup and
[1:58:30] man they're right with you all the way
[1:58:32] but you go over and say but you watch as
[1:58:35] soon as you get the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:58:37] make you shout it'll make you liberate
[1:58:39] it'll make you get to a spot that you're
[1:58:41] not
[1:58:43] ashamed because I believe what the
[1:58:45] prophet said that if you say you got the
[1:58:48] Holy Ghost and says sh but don't tell
[1:58:50] nobody then you really ain't got
[1:58:58] it I done got that spirit and it ain't a
[1:59:00] person it's a spirit it's a spirit that
[1:59:03] does it it's a spirit that gets in there
[1:59:05] and said we don't need them Miracles we
[1:59:06] don't need them things we done gone up
[1:59:08] into higher Places come on up here let
[1:59:11] me tell you what is this message it's a
[1:59:13] message of Grace of shoutings of Grace
[1:59:17] Grace well brother Andrew don't you know
[1:59:18] we're under a Joshua commission and they
[1:59:21] was in Moses day that he had the
[1:59:23] Miracles but if you will study out your
[1:59:26] Bible in Joshua chapter 3 that the Bible
[1:59:29] said that this day I will begin to
[1:59:32] magnify you Joshua amongst all the sight
[1:59:35] of the children of
[1:59:38] Israel oh
[1:59:41] yeah so let me say like this your ideas
[1:59:45] and your blockages will never stop our
[1:59:47] miracles from
[1:59:51] coming
[1:59:56] Joshua you ain't seen nothing yet
[2:00:00] there's miracles on top of Miracles
[2:00:03] there's cancers leaving there's babies
[2:00:05] coming there's prodal
[2:00:08] returning I'm not trying to push this
[2:00:11] down your throat I'm trly simply trying
[2:00:13] to say that this is the land of the
[2:00:16] message that you're living in it's a
[2:00:18] land flowing with milk and
[2:00:20] honey and every single time you see a
[2:00:22] devil rise up and try to scare you away
[2:00:25] from it remember it's nothing but a
[2:00:28] devil because the land is yours whether
[2:00:31] Satan lies the fruit is yours whether
[2:00:34] Giants show
[2:00:36] up your Future's
[2:00:43] clear when walls show
[2:00:50] up
[2:00:53] this is
[2:00:54] rolling the reproach of slavery off of
[2:01:00] you you don't have to live that kind of
[2:01:03] way you don't have to live under that
[2:01:05] kind of
[2:01:05] mindset you don't have to live under
[2:01:07] that kind of scrutiny if a spirit is
[2:01:10] keeping you from fully releasing
[2:01:12] yourself to be who you
[2:01:17] are my I knew we was in for spiritual
[2:01:20] warfare but we're really in it ain't
[2:01:23] but this is rolling away
[2:01:25] that you're not a
[2:01:27] slave you're not under depression you're
[2:01:31] not under legalism you're not under
[2:01:33] oppression you're not under bondage
[2:01:36] you're in perfect
[2:01:38] Liberty because when Paul said in 2
[2:01:40] Corinthians and three he said that when
[2:01:43] it is turned to the Lord the veil will
[2:01:47] be taken
[2:01:48] away when what is turn sister herler
[2:01:52] when what is turned when the heart is
[2:01:55] turned then the veil will be taken away
[2:01:58] what is the message brother it's Malachi
[2:02:01] 4 it's the Turning of our hearts back to
[2:02:05] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers and
[2:02:09] the Lord is that spirit and where the
[2:02:12] spirit of the Lord is there is
[2:02:17] Liberty satan in the name of Jesus
[2:02:20] Christ I bind you and all of your power
[2:02:25] you have no legal Authority amongst the
[2:02:27] Church of the Living
[2:02:30] God you cannot bind us because we've
[2:02:33] been set free you cannot hinder us
[2:02:36] because we've got an open Vision you
[2:02:38] cannot make us bow to you because we've
[2:02:41] received the
[2:02:47] word
[2:02:48] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:02:51] Lord somebody give him
[2:03:01] praise that's where you're living at
[2:03:04] you're not living in bondage you're not
[2:03:06] living in fear when Jesus Takes a woman
[2:03:10] caught in ad doar Tre he looks on her
[2:03:12] and said woman thou art
[2:03:15] loosed you're loose from your bondage
[2:03:17] you're loose from your sin you're loose
[2:03:19] from your pride you're Loos from your
[2:03:22] condemnation you're Loos from
[2:03:24] idolatry you're
[2:03:26] Loos you're
[2:03:30] Loos
[2:03:32] hallelujah
[2:03:34] hallelujah and you're loose from
[2:03:44] legalism what is
[2:03:47] it we're in end time we're in end time
[2:03:51] and I know we're in to Showdown right
[2:03:53] here but don't worry don't worry God the
[2:03:56] almighty God that stood up when Abram
[2:03:59] was 99 years
[2:04:02] old and he said I am the almighty don't
[2:04:05] you worry about The Showdown that we're
[2:04:06] in right now God is the all powerful one
[2:04:10] he is elad and when you don't think you
[2:04:13] got enough strength he is your strength
[2:04:16] all you got to do is pull on him and
[2:04:18] he'll give forth power out of el Shi
[2:04:22] Abraham nursed a new body what are you
[2:04:24] doing in this hour you are nursing the
[2:04:27] very strength for your body change right
[2:04:30] out of this message he is the almighty
[2:04:35] God what did he give him what did he
[2:04:38] give him he gave him the Seal of
[2:04:43] circumcision that it was a token between
[2:04:46] him and
[2:04:47] him it's of righteousness of faith
[2:04:55] imagine brother Chester all them
[2:04:59] years your name's High father but
[2:05:02] where's your son
[2:05:04] at your name's High father but where's
[2:05:06] all your children at but

[2:05:17] Abraham what did he do he put a part of
[2:05:20] himself in there
[2:05:22] so that the promise could be
[2:05:25] fulfilled you'll never roll away your
