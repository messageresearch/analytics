[0:00] [Music]
[0:12] one time i
[0:13] got to preaching way down in the
[0:14] mountains of kentucky
[0:16] where i was born as i stepped outside
[0:20] the door of the church
[0:21] there was a a man standing there which
[0:24] was a trapper across the hills
[0:26] a great big judah bacca in his mouth
[0:30] that when he had met me the day before
[0:33] and
[0:34] i was squirrel hunting and he was
[0:35] sitting out on the log talking and
[0:38] and they were talking about a little
[0:39] baby been healed the night before
[0:41] which they said had the jerks
[0:44] palsy and they didn't know i was in the
[0:48] woods
[0:49] and this great big fellow with a hat on
[0:51] made out of limb bark
[0:53] i guess there's not a person here ever
[0:55] seen a limb bark hat
[0:57] take hickory bark and scale it off make
[0:59] a hat out of it weave it together
[1:02] and then sitting on that log that
[1:04] stopped sawing
[1:05] the winchester rifles on the trees
[1:08] feuding
[1:10] and money was talking he had a big
[1:12] shooter back in his mouth
[1:14] and he spit in the leaves would fly up
[1:17] he said i saw that youngin stop
[1:21] shaking
[1:22] [Music]
[1:24] i heard him getting pretty rough talking
[1:27] i thought i better make myself known
[1:31] i didn't want to be a stranger going up
[1:33] through those bushes
[1:35] and i said good morning gentlemen
[1:39] that rough bunch of men who would kill
[1:41] you at the drop of your hat
[1:44] jumped to their feet and this big fellow
[1:48] with that long
[1:49] neck and his adam's apple sticking out
[1:52] he looked at me his eyes pushed out
[1:56] he jerked off that hat and swallowed
[1:59] that judah backer
[2:02] and said good morning parson
[2:06] oh if christ is presented
[2:10] in the right way the world
[2:13] will respect it if there's any respect
[2:16] in them
[2:17] certainly it is if it's brought in the
[2:20] way of divine
[2:22] light that night when they left the
[2:26] church
[2:28] he had a lantern in his hand he said i'd
[2:31] give anything parson if i could only
[2:36] believe that god would forgive me of my
[2:38] sins
[2:41] he said i've killed two israeli man
[2:44] and i know that i'm a guilty sinner
[2:49] but when i have seen them things happen
[2:51] in that little church
[2:53] i am aware that there is a true and
[2:55] living god
[2:59] i said he will forgive you
[3:01] [Music]
[3:03] and he wants to forgive you and the very
[3:06] hunger in your heart
[3:08] means that he's working on your soul
[3:13] he said if i could only feel it
[3:16] i said you'll feel it he said when i
[3:18] feel it i'll believe it
[3:20] i said believe it and then you'll feel
[3:22] it
[3:25] he said i wish i know how to do it i
[3:28] said where do you live
[3:29] he said across the mountain about two
[3:32] miles
[3:33] how do you get there up over the ridges
[3:36] and to the paths
[3:37] i said it's very dark he said but i got
[3:40] a lantern
[3:41] i said you can't see your house with
[3:44] your lantern
[3:46] he said no that's right i said then how
[3:48] you know you're going to get there
[3:52] i said just take the lanyard in your
[3:54] hand
[3:55] and you're standing in the light you
[3:58] walk in the right direction
[4:00] every step you make the light will light
[4:03] up the road

[4:12] blessings
[4:14] stand in his power if you're sick how
[4:16] are you going to get well

[58:30] today
[58:32] father god as we surrender ourself to
[58:34] you lord may you bless the reading
[58:36] of the scripture and everything that's

[59:04] pray
[59:05] lord we now invite you to come and have
[59:07] the preeminence in jesus name we ask it
[59:10] all for your glory
[59:11] and the saints said amen
[59:15] turn with me if you would to first
[59:16] corinthians chapter 12.
[59:18] i greet all you that wasn't here last
[59:20] night and good to see you again today
[59:22] and
[59:23] just pray that today will be a real day
[59:25] to you and an encouragement to you and
[59:27] and god to give you strength and victory
[59:30] and peace and
[59:31] overcoming grace
[59:34] we're all in a battle
[59:38] but there are promised to be some
[59:39] overcomers
[59:41] in this day and in this church
[59:44] there will be a group of overcomers
[59:48] amen that's what we believe today we'll
[59:50] just kind of continue on with the
[59:52] thought from last night on what it takes
[59:54] to produce a rapture
[59:56] and i want to read now in first
[59:58] corinthians chapter 12 verse
[1:00:00] 26 and whether one member
[1:00:03] suffer all members suffer with it
[1:00:06] or one member be honored all the members
[1:00:09] rejoice with it
[1:00:11] now we are the body of christ and
[1:00:13] members in particular
[1:00:15] and god has sent some in the church
[1:00:17] first apostles secondary prophets
[1:00:19] thirdly teachers after that miracles
[1:00:21] then gifts of healings helps
[1:00:23] governments diversity of tongues are all
[1:00:26] apostles are all
[1:00:27] prophets are all teachers or all workers
[1:00:29] of miracles
[1:00:30] have all the gifts of healing do all
[1:00:32] speak with tongues
[1:00:34] and do all interpret may the lord have
[1:00:36] his blessing you may be seated
[1:00:39] we know that not all have all the gifts
[1:00:43] but i wanted to read you something out
[1:00:44] of this spiritual food and due season
[1:00:47] brother branham says now he embodies
[1:00:49] himself
[1:00:50] taking your body and my body and gives
[1:00:54] you gifts
[1:00:56] he gives me gifts and through these
[1:00:58] gifts he makes himself known
[1:01:01] and he says that's the secret food
[1:01:05] but you have to understand we all have a
[1:01:07] diversity of gifts everybody's gift is
[1:01:09] different
[1:01:10] one might just be ministering one might
[1:01:12] be speaking in tongues and
[1:01:14] one might be the gift of of prophecy or
[1:01:16] whatever but then he goes no matter how
[1:01:18] much he would make himself known by me
[1:01:21] you've got to believe it you've got to
[1:01:24] have the gift of faith too
[1:01:27] to believe it so god grant us all the
[1:01:31] gift of faith this morning that
[1:01:32] that we could at least believe the word
[1:01:35] of god
[1:01:39] we could believe all things are possible
[1:01:41] we can believe for the impossible
[1:01:44] amen so we are living in a time a
[1:01:47] manifesting time
[1:01:49] we realize there's fixing to be a
[1:01:51] rapture we realize that it might not be
[1:01:54] too many more days
[1:01:55] and it might not be too many more hours
[1:01:58] but we do realize we're living in a time
[1:02:01] when the grain is maturing
[1:02:04] the grain will show what seed it is of
[1:02:07] in the time when it matures and and the
[1:02:10] church you know started out in its
[1:02:11] infancy
[1:02:12] back in the dark ages but when it was
[1:02:14] underground but now
[1:02:16] it's grew up into maturity the life
[1:02:20] is in the grain again exactly like it
[1:02:24] was a
[1:02:24] same grain that went in the ground the
[1:02:27] same jesus today in bride form
[1:02:30] the same power the same church the same
[1:02:33] word
[1:02:34] he's alive today
[1:02:38] hallelujah was the same word that pulled
[1:02:41] them all up through all the ages
[1:02:43] and sucked them up into this age and put
[1:02:45] life back in the people
[1:02:49] we dwelt a lot last night on making the
[1:02:51] word live
[1:02:52] brotherhood said only the believers can
[1:02:54] make the word live
[1:02:55] how many believers are here this morning
[1:03:01] and in that day when the son of man
[1:03:05] is to be revealed what did he what did
[1:03:08] he come to be revealed for
[1:03:09] to join the head to the body
[1:03:14] to unite us together and brethren said
[1:03:17] and the bridegroom call will come right
[1:03:19] through this
[1:03:20] when the son of man will come down and
[1:03:22] come in human flesh
[1:03:24] to unite the two together the church has
[1:03:27] to be the word
[1:03:29] he is the word and the two unites
[1:03:32] together now what's that gonna make you
[1:03:35] the word you will be the word
[1:03:38] made flesh in this day he says see it's
[1:03:42] the son of man
[1:03:43] jesus christ will come down in human
[1:03:45] flesh among us
[1:03:46] he will make his word so real
[1:03:52] he will make his word so real
[1:03:56] that it unites us together and we're
[1:04:00] going to a wedding supper
[1:04:02] listen we're not going to a wedding
[1:04:04] we're married here
[1:04:07] we're going to the supper
[1:04:11] let us rejoice and be glad and give
[1:04:13] honor for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:04:15] come
[1:04:16] and his wife hath made herself ready
[1:04:22] hallelujah when the word unites with the
[1:04:25] person the two become one
[1:04:31] i like how he says it's improving his
[1:04:33] word then what does it do
[1:04:37] when the two have become one what does
[1:04:39] it do it manifests
[1:04:42] the son of man again
[1:04:45] not church theologians the son of man
[1:04:49] the word and the church becomes one
[1:04:56] oh brother listen i thought brother
[1:04:58] branham was the holy one that was to
[1:04:59] reveal the son of man he started the
[1:05:01] process
[1:05:02] but you must become the word in order
[1:05:05] for the son of man to be revealed
[1:05:07] in this day and this hour in this church
[1:05:10] in your life
[1:05:15] he's the son of man christ the word he
[1:05:18] comes down
[1:05:20] and whatever the son of man done the
[1:05:23] church does the same thing
[1:05:27] when jesus was here what did he do he
[1:05:29] healed the sick he raised the dead
[1:05:30] they laid hands on people he restored
[1:05:32] highs
[1:05:34] he restored bodies back again he raised
[1:05:37] jarius's daughter
[1:05:40] that same lord jesus i declare to you
[1:05:42] this lord
[1:05:43] is in the building he is here he will do
[1:05:47] anything you can believe for
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:05:55] he's here elijah's god's with us today
[1:06:03] hope you don't mind a couple of quotes
[1:06:04] this morning
[1:06:06] i know you're believers so you won't
[1:06:08] mind them
[1:06:11] had one woman say well if i if i wanted
[1:06:13] to well anyhow
[1:06:18] she said i can read at home but it ain't
[1:06:21] the same
[1:06:22] when god begins placing things together
[1:06:25] that's why you come together there's
[1:06:27] gifts that's in the body
[1:06:28] one man has a gift to pull this out
[1:06:30] another man has a gift to pull the head
[1:06:32] out
[1:06:32] and you put the whole thing together and
[1:06:34] you bring your lick of fire together
[1:06:36] you know what happens when you come and
[1:06:38] bring your licks of fire the prophet of
[1:06:40] god said it brings back the fullness
[1:06:42] of the pillar of fire
[1:06:46] could i declare to you this morning he's
[1:06:48] here
[1:06:50] the pillar of fire is here the angel of
[1:06:53] the lord is here
[1:06:57] brother said we should realize that it's
[1:07:00] in us
[1:07:00] has been given we believe who in jesus
[1:07:03] christ's been filled with the spirit
[1:07:04] quickening power that power's in you
[1:07:09] by laying on hands on others like the
[1:07:11] disciples did down through the age
[1:07:14] it absolutely healed the sick
[1:07:17] raised the dead and it showed visions
[1:07:21] and prophecies this is what happened
[1:07:24] when he came
[1:07:26] it showed visions it showed prophecies
[1:07:28] it healed the sick it raised the dead
[1:07:30] and the very same spirit that lived
[1:07:32] among the early apostles
[1:07:34] is living in the church today
[1:07:38] working the very same thing proving the
[1:07:42] son of man is here
[1:07:45] listen i didn't declare he was here but
[1:07:48] the scripture declared he was here
[1:07:50] william branham declared he was here and
[1:07:53] that's good enough for me
[1:07:58] no matter how it's working if it's
[1:08:01] working in me if it's working in andrew
[1:08:03] if it's working brother ron
[1:08:04] or one of your brother matt or whoever
[1:08:06] it may be
[1:08:07] you've got to recognize
[1:08:10] and believe it or it ain't going to do
[1:08:14] us one bit of good
[1:08:16] huh but the moment you believe it your
[1:08:19] troubles have ended
[1:08:21] projections that mean i'm going gonna
[1:08:23] have no more battles that's not what he
[1:08:24] said
[1:08:25] but now you're on the wedding side
[1:08:30] you know in whom you have believed
[1:08:36] well jason wood i just don't see god
[1:08:38] moving anymore you're blind
[1:08:42] you are blind and may god open your eyes
[1:08:44] today
[1:08:47] now i have heard but now i see the
[1:08:49] prophet god said he goes now we find in
[1:08:50] these hours of real stress
[1:08:52] that's usually when the spirit of god
[1:08:53] moves in
[1:08:56] he let the hebrew children walk right up
[1:08:58] and go right into the fire
[1:09:01] he let daniel step right into the lion's
[1:09:03] den
[1:09:04] he let the disciples be almost out there
[1:09:07] and almost drowned
[1:09:10] he he let jurassic's daughter actually
[1:09:13] die
[1:09:16] he let lazarus go by the way of the
[1:09:18] grave but then the grave riser come on
[1:09:21] the scene
[1:09:22] he'll allow these things to happen
[1:09:25] understand now listen to what the
[1:09:26] prophet said
[1:09:27] but when he moved he moves
[1:09:31] when god gets ready to move he moves
[1:09:35] and he walks up to the tomb of lazarus
[1:09:37] and he tells him roll back the stone
[1:09:42] and then he speaks lazarus
[1:09:45] come forth
[1:09:49] with andrew such power and that voice if
[1:09:50] he hadn't identified who it was the
[1:09:52] whole resurrection would have took place
[1:09:55] he identified who it was
[1:09:59] that's what happened with the message
[1:10:00] today when they come
[1:10:03] it personally identified each and every
[1:10:06] one of us
[1:10:06] and he said there in the first seal i
[1:10:08] believe or in the breach he said i no
[1:10:10] longer call you church
[1:10:12] but i call you bride that you might
[1:10:14] understand
[1:10:15] he identified who you are
[1:10:19] you're not just the church
[1:10:25] you're the bride you're the lamb's wife
[1:10:30] well glory well jason but i don't feel
[1:10:34] like the lamb's wife
[1:10:37] since when did this become a game of
[1:10:42] feelings
[1:10:44] have you ever felt like sometimes you
[1:10:45] wouldn't saved
[1:10:48] you can be honest sometimes you feel
[1:10:51] you ever felt like you're the only one
[1:10:53] elijah felt like he was the only one to
[1:10:55] god opened his
[1:10:57] you ever felt like you was in a
[1:10:59] spiritual desert and you couldn't hardly
[1:11:01] get a prayer through
[1:11:03] you ever feel like that sometimes
[1:11:04] everybody's against you
[1:11:06] including your wife or your husband or
[1:11:08] the whoever it might you feel that way
[1:11:10] sometimes
[1:11:11] but that's the devil making you feel
[1:11:13] that way
[1:11:15] but you are the spotless virtuous
[1:11:17] sinless bride
[1:11:19] of jesus christ
[1:11:23] if the church could only today reflect
[1:11:25] what it was at the original pentecost
[1:11:29] jesus reflected what he was to be he was
[1:11:31] reflected through all the prophets
[1:11:35] and it comes down to this day who are we
[1:11:38] going to be reflecting
[1:11:42] i remember the first sermon i ever
[1:11:43] preached i preached on reflection it was
[1:11:45] 11 minutes
[1:11:47] i had four pages of notes i thought dear
[1:11:49] lord jesus it's going to take me a long
[1:11:51] time to get through these
[1:11:52] 11 minutes
[1:11:56] i beat andrew
[1:12:00] but you it's not about how long the
[1:12:01] sermon is
[1:12:03] it's about what the content is
[1:12:07] huh prophet of god said in one place
[1:12:09] probably the most effective sermon paul
[1:12:11] ever preached was about 20 minutes
[1:12:14] i plan on going longer in 20 minutes but
[1:12:16] whatever the lord wants us to do that's
[1:12:18] where we want to be found at
[1:12:20] don't get concerned with the time if
[1:12:22] it's an hour and 20 minutes or 20
[1:12:24] minutes
[1:12:24] the thing about it is is did jesus come
[1:12:27] by
[1:12:28] and if the word came forward and jesus
[1:12:31] come by
[1:12:32] it will change lives
[1:12:39] hallelujah and when the great power of
[1:12:42] the
[1:12:42] living god comes into a son of god it
[1:12:45] quickens him
[1:12:46] and life enters into him
[1:12:50] it's not in one day he will be a son of
[1:12:53] god
[1:12:53] he already is a son of god
[1:12:59] and if you're part of the bride you're
[1:13:00] part of the bridegroom
[1:13:04] brother yes i'm afraid i'm gonna miss
[1:13:05] the rapture if you're a part of the
[1:13:06] bride
[1:13:07] you'll not miss the rapture
[1:13:10] whatever it takes god to get you ready
[1:13:13] you cannot miss the part that you
[1:13:15] are if the holy ghost is in you
[1:13:19] you'll do exactly what's predicted for
[1:13:21] our day for you to do
[1:13:24] my brother ram said she won't be a
[1:13:26] lukewarm
[1:13:29] we're not going to be lukewarm no
[1:13:33] but we're going to be on fire for god
[1:13:38] we're going to be moving in the spirit
[1:13:39] of god we're going to be letting the
[1:13:41] word come to pass in our life
[1:13:43] we're going to become the very word
[1:13:45] that's on the page just
[1:13:47] let it take on life
[1:13:51] you don't have to make the promises come
[1:13:53] to pass
[1:13:56] if you try to make the promises of god
[1:13:58] come to pass you'll have a mess
[1:14:01] sarah tried to make the promise come to
[1:14:03] pass
[1:14:05] ah she it was a supernatural promise and
[1:14:08] she handpicked hagar
[1:14:10] for the promise to come to pass through
[1:14:12] but in doing that
[1:14:13] she made a perversion out of it
[1:14:16] listen let's not pervert the gospel of
[1:14:18] jesus christ
[1:14:20] but let's just live the word of god and
[1:14:22] the bible said these signs shall follow
[1:14:24] them
[1:14:24] that believe
[1:14:30] he'll bring him to pass you ain't got to
[1:14:33] try to do it
[1:14:36] there ain't nothing you can do about it
[1:14:38] well who can add one
[1:14:40] inch to his stature who can change one
[1:14:42] thing about himself
[1:14:45] who can make the holy ghost come into
[1:14:47] service who can make the pillar of fire
[1:14:49] visible you can't
[1:14:52] but god can
[1:14:56] you know he was like there was a all
[1:14:58] back through luther and wesley and
[1:15:00] pentecost they were carriers
[1:15:02] of the seed were getting to a rapture
[1:15:06] they were they were building it up see
[1:15:09] they were a vital importance
[1:15:13] you can't do away with justification you
[1:15:14] can't do away with sanctification
[1:15:16] you can't do away with those things but
[1:15:18] there had to come a time
[1:15:20] when the seed would produce itself again
[1:15:24] and it's happened in this day
[1:15:27] glory he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:29] forever
[1:15:30] and the same pillar of fire is here
[1:15:32] showing the same signs and the same
[1:15:34] power
[1:15:35] and the same miracles
[1:15:39] vindicating the bible the word of god in
[1:15:43] this day
[1:15:45] he is the vindicator
[1:15:49] program said in god's provided place of
[1:15:50] worship he said do you realize that
[1:15:52] you've been raised from death into life
[1:15:55] you've been baptized into the body by
[1:15:57] the living god
[1:15:58] that's quick in your body
[1:16:02] where there's tongues where there's
[1:16:04] interpretation of tongues seeing
[1:16:06] jesus christ manifested among us why
[1:16:09] sickness couldn't stand in such a group
[1:16:15] are we that kind of group yeah
[1:16:19] we're that kind of group this morning
[1:16:21] sickness can't stand
[1:16:23] in that kind of group brother jason but
[1:16:26] brother ron's been sick a long time
[1:16:28] yeah just about a year but i can tell
[1:16:30] you in a moment's time
[1:16:32] god can transform the entire body and
[1:16:34] bring a complete restoration to it
[1:16:37] [Applause]
[1:16:39] program said let go let your faith go to
[1:16:42] heal
[1:16:43] and believe and say lord i believe it
[1:16:46] with all of my heart
[1:16:48] and you will be made well
[1:16:52] that's a promise
[1:16:58] and if that promise was good in 1965
[1:17:01] when it was priest or whenever it was
[1:17:03] preached there yeah 1965
[1:17:05] it's good today because he's the same
[1:17:08] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:09] it's the same grain it's the same seed
[1:17:11] again that went in the ground the james
[1:17:13] jesus and bradford
[1:17:15] is here today doing the same works with
[1:17:18] the same power
[1:17:19] and the same church and the same word
[1:17:24] forming up and getting ready for a
[1:17:26] rapture
[1:17:28] what's it going to take brother jason
[1:17:30] the word to be manifested in our lives
[1:17:38] and when the word becomes manifested in
[1:17:40] your life
[1:17:41] and my life and my kid's life
[1:17:45] huh we're believing for every one of
[1:17:47] them
[1:17:50] an entire word of god is made complete
[1:17:53] and it's moving in the people listen in
[1:17:56] jesus christ god made me pay for my sins
[1:17:59] in him he rose i rose with him
[1:18:03] when he arose hallelujah and we are
[1:18:07] setting seating together
[1:18:09] in heavenly places with power and
[1:18:11] authority
[1:18:12] over every devil
[1:18:15] ever devil is subject to the bride of
[1:18:19] jesus christ
[1:18:22] these are more than just words these are
[1:18:25] powerful
[1:18:26] statements if we'll take them and
[1:18:28] believe them
[1:18:30] put it into action i love this part i
[1:18:34] read this that brother andrew coming to
[1:18:35] church i said
[1:18:36] oh if you could only believe what god
[1:18:38] has given but if you're not
[1:18:40] seated there you don't have it and if
[1:18:43] you're seated there and don't believe it
[1:18:44] and afraid to move you'll never use it
[1:18:47] but if you are seated there you will use
[1:18:50] it
[1:18:51] for your ordained to do what you
[1:18:54] do god has ordained us in this hour
[1:18:58] to be sons and daughters of god he
[1:19:00] ordained gifts in your life
[1:19:05] he ordained gifts in brother ron's life
[1:19:08] and his gifts aren't like my gifts and
[1:19:09] my gifts aren't like your gifts
[1:19:13] but it's to edify it's to build up
[1:19:19] and when one of us suffer we all suffer
[1:19:22] and when one gets honored we all glory
[1:19:24] in it
[1:19:26] bro jason god don't do miracles much
[1:19:28] anymore just hold it right there

[1:19:32] internet and they haven't seen god do a
[1:19:35] miracle

[1:21:47] restored
[1:21:48] we need families restored we need
[1:21:51] spiritual storms spoke out of existence

[1:21:59] bodies
[1:22:01] we need some of us need complete
[1:22:03] restoration in our bodies

[1:22:36] got a purpose to come down and bring
[1:22:38] somebody from arkansas to come down here
[1:22:40] to preach to a group in virginia

[1:22:53] he's passing by don't miss your day of
[1:22:56] visitation
[1:23:01] it's not canceled cove would cancel a
[1:23:04] lot of things
[1:23:06] canceled our churches
[1:23:10] weeks and months some of us went without
[1:23:12] church
[1:23:18] the devil goes cancel i'm beating them
[1:23:20] down i'm canceling them
[1:23:23] but somewhere in your prayer closet
[1:23:26] somewhere in your study and in your
[1:23:28] office you still got a hold of god
[1:23:32] the devil might have closed the doors
[1:23:34] for a temporary time
[1:23:35] but he didn't close your heart up
[1:23:39] the devil can't close that communication
[1:23:41] hook i told the church back home take
[1:23:43] away my bible
[1:23:44] take away my tapes take away all my
[1:23:47] message books but there's one thing you
[1:23:48] can't take away
[1:23:50] you cannot take away the god that's not
[1:23:52] on the inside of me
[1:23:53] because it didn't come from me it came
[1:23:56] from god
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:10] i was thinking about brother caleb the
[1:24:11] other day there in prison
[1:24:13] no bible no books
[1:24:16] and he's still winning muslims to christ
[1:24:20] because the bible's not here it's here
[1:24:25] the message wasn't here it became here
[1:24:29] and when the word comes down on the
[1:24:31] inside of you
[1:24:32] and you begin to make it live
[1:24:37] it changes your world it changes
[1:24:40] everything about you
[1:24:42] man my wife we're listening to some
[1:24:44] songs from brother tim's
[1:24:46] uh 2019 october meetings and
[1:24:49] brother ron that's when he preached take
[1:24:51] it back
[1:24:53] i play that clip a lot saved it on my
[1:24:57] phone
[1:24:58] take it back there was a man already eat
[1:25:01] up with cancer
[1:25:02] didn't even know it preaching to himself
[1:25:06] take it back preaching to the bride
[1:25:10] take it back
[1:25:15] my wife made this comment she goes i'd
[1:25:17] give anything
[1:25:19] to be able to do this again
[1:25:22] to sit in meetings like this again i'd
[1:25:24] do anything
[1:25:26] and i begin to think for a moment will
[1:25:29] we ever
[1:25:30] will we ever be able to have special
[1:25:32] meetings like that again
[1:25:33] we don't know
[1:25:37] could we have let the precious moments
[1:25:40] pass by
[1:25:41] and discard it as just another meeting
[1:25:44] brother i wonder how many were in that
[1:25:46] meeting that just it was just another
[1:25:48] meeting we're coming back next year
[1:25:49] but there wasn't another time
[1:25:54] legitimate you come every november
[1:25:56] you'll be back next year
[1:25:57] we may not be here next year we may be
[1:25:59] in glory next year
[1:26:05] have we just let it pass us by and it's
[1:26:08] just become another church service
[1:26:10] we don't know church we may not be able
[1:26:12] to have church next sunday
[1:26:16] we're not given another sunday we're not
[1:26:19] given another day a promise of it
[1:26:22] but we do know one thing if there is no
[1:26:25] next sunday morning service or saturday
[1:26:27] night service
[1:26:28] you can still yet be in service with
[1:26:30] christ regardless of where you are
[1:26:35] meetings may have all be canceled this
[1:26:37] year but i want to remind you
[1:26:39] of another meeting
[1:26:42] and this meeting i'm talking about covet
[1:26:45] will never
[1:26:46] cancel this meeting
[1:26:51] viruses will never cancel this meeting

[1:27:10] i'm going to be there
[1:27:14] how many is going with me
[1:27:18] when god moves he moves
[1:27:23] god's able to move this virus right out
[1:27:25] and obliviate it
[1:27:27] god's able to make it where we can have
[1:27:29] meetings again
[1:27:30] but that's his his doing the most
[1:27:34] important thing is is we're ready when

[1:39:06] walk
[1:39:08] he was paralyzed from here down

[1:39:15] shepherd rehab center he told the
[1:39:16] doctors
[1:39:17] they said you need to learn to accept
[1:39:19] you'll never be able to walk again he
[1:39:20] looked at me said i'll walk out of this
[1:39:22] place
[1:39:24] they said well whatever he said i'm
[1:39:26] telling you
[1:39:27] i'll walk out of this place six months
[1:39:31] later the doctors and nurses lined up
[1:39:33] and cried as the man walked out of the
[1:39:35] building
[1:39:36] yeah he had a cage but he still walked
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:43] and during that time they didn't have
[1:39:46] any income
[1:39:48] and the bank account never went down and
[1:39:51] all the bills were paid
[1:39:55] now you tell me who did that
[1:39:58] brother jason maybe he used an
[1:40:00] individual still god
[1:40:04] still got to be able to afford two
[1:40:06] households
[1:40:08] that's the power of god and there's just
[1:40:11] another little bitty simple thing
[1:40:13] some of you think it's simple that goes
[1:40:14] with it but when he was laying there his
[1:40:16] hands were so swelled
[1:40:19] he tried to raise up and he knew
[1:40:20] something was wrong
[1:40:22] excuse me his hands were so swelled they
[1:40:24] had to cut his wedding band off
[1:40:27] and they lost it in memphis
[1:40:31] and sister rebecca got to pray and lord
[1:40:35] i mean it's just a wedding band but you
[1:40:36] still there's memories there
[1:40:39] and they called him one day and said mr
[1:40:42] perez we have your
[1:40:44] some articles of clothing and things
[1:40:46] that belong to you here
[1:40:48] he's like okay good but i ain't driving
[1:40:51] to memphis to get him
[1:40:54] i don't feel like driving to memphis his
[1:40:56] wife says we need to go to memphis and
[1:40:57] get him
[1:40:59] anyhow they made it to memphis to get
[1:41:00] him and when they opened up the baggage
[1:41:02] there was his ring never cut
[1:41:12] four or five times the nurses tried to
[1:41:14] kill him in memphis they hated him
[1:41:17] and they they would do stuff to him to
[1:41:19] agitate him
[1:41:21] and his wife had pinned the prayer cloth
[1:41:23] on him and they'd take it off
[1:41:27] and she walked in one morning and he
[1:41:28] started crashing he started coding
[1:41:30] and she just reached over and she put
[1:41:31] that prayer cloth on the bottom of his
[1:41:33] foot
[1:41:33] and the heart rate went
[1:41:36] three or four times it happened it's
[1:41:39] because he's god
[1:41:42] he's god and god is a god of restoration
[1:41:46] he's
[1:41:47] listen church he can restore families he
[1:41:49] can restore homes
[1:41:51] he can restore jobs
[1:41:55] he could restore jarius's daughter when
[1:41:57] she was dead
[1:41:58] even the roman centurio just speak the
[1:42:00] word when i get home my child will be
[1:42:02] well
[1:42:03] it'll be just like you said jesus said i
[1:42:05] ain't found so much faith in all of
[1:42:07] israel
[1:42:09] just speak the word
[1:42:12] what did that quote say there's coming
[1:42:14] of power in the church
[1:42:15] to where and it is now he said where
[1:42:18] they'll just speak the word
[1:42:19] and it'll be created
[1:42:25] he said it i believe it roses you think
[1:42:29] god can do that i know god can do that
[1:42:31] when brother andrew was at the church
[1:42:33] last year we had during that month of
[1:42:35] may or june we had 20-something miracles
[1:42:38] when him and brother ron was there take
[1:42:40] place
[1:42:45] 20-something miracles
[1:42:48] he prayed for a man with states for
[1:42:50] cancer
[1:42:51] and god has healed him
[1:42:54] all right you think god is no respecter
[1:42:58] person
[1:43:00] if he could pray for a man with stage 4
[1:43:02] cancer could we not pray for him
[1:43:05] with stage 4 cancer and get the same
[1:43:08] results because he's the same lord jesus
[1:43:13] will glory huh these signs shall follow
[1:43:16] them that believe
[1:43:19] and yes there was a man healed of states
[1:43:21] for cancer and there was a lady healed
[1:43:22] of
[1:43:23] of eyes that were double vision and it
[1:43:25] was just on and on and on
[1:43:28] but there was another miracle
[1:43:31] the greatest miracle
[1:43:37] as god restored my church
[1:43:43] when the devil set out to destroy it
[1:43:49] and tried to cause division because of
[1:43:51] something that had happened
[1:43:53] that was out of my control
[1:43:57] but god rich in mercy
[1:44:01] brother on that saturday night and
[1:44:03] sunday morning god
[1:44:05] used your pastor
[1:44:10] to save my church
[1:44:18] and how may that same lord jesus
[1:44:23] be able to return the favor this morning
[1:44:25] brother andrew
[1:44:27] not to save the church
[1:44:30] but may god use these hands this morning
[1:44:34] to be able to lay upon that man
[1:44:38] and give him a complete restoration

[1:45:01] god said only the believer
[1:45:03] can make it live
[1:45:07] i don't care what the naysayer says i'm
[1:45:10] a believer

[1:45:14] believer

[1:45:18] a believer
[1:45:19] and i believe this bible from cover to
