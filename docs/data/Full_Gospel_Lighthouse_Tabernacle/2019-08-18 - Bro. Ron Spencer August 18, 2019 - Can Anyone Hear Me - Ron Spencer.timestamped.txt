[7:06] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[7:09] that my soul knoweth wrought well my
[7:15] substance was not hid from thee when I
[7:18] was made in secret and furiously wrought
[7:22] in the lowest parts of the earth an oz
[7:25] did see my substance yet being unperfect
[7:30] that's just total honesty and in the hop
[7:35] book all my members were written which
[7:39] is continuance were fashioned when as
[7:42] yet there was none of them how precious
[7:47] are thy thoughts
[7:49] unto me O God how great this is some of
[7:56] them what a powerful powerful scripture
[8:01] let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with
[8:05] all of our hearts tonight and lord I
[8:08] just ask you that you would anoint our
[8:10] hearts in a special way Lord the pre
[8:13] service has been awesome and Lord we
[8:16] just ask you that as we come now Lord
[8:19] we're asking for rain on the outside but
[8:21] may it rain on the inside too not father
[8:24] come and fill our cups Lord Jesus Lord
[8:28] we just ask you to minister to our needs
[8:31] tonight you have dealt with this in a
[8:33] special way and we ask you now that
[8:36] you'd come and speak to our hearts in
[8:37] Jesus Christ's name they've met any man
[8:40] you can be seated Psalms chapter 42 and
[8:44] verse 1
[8:52] this is familiar to you as a heart
[8:55] Paneth for the water Brooks so panteth
[9:00] my soul after thee o God my soul
[9:06] thirsteth for God for the Living God
[9:09] when I shall come and appear before him
[9:13] brother branham would liken this panting
[9:16] for the water brook as a deer panteth
[9:20] it's life and death if it don't get
[9:22] water a deer screaming for water its
[9:28] life if it can get to it tonight I want
[9:33] to scream to some dear Saints its life
[9:38] if you can get to it my tears have been
[9:45] my meat day and night they had
[9:48] continually saying to me where is that
[9:52] God when I remember these things I my
[9:57] soul in me for I had gone with the
[10:00] multitude I went with them to the house
[10:02] of God and the voice of joy and praise
[10:05] and the multitude that kept holy day
[10:08] notice these next words why art thou
[10:12] cast down old my soul and why art thou
[10:18] disquieted in me hope thou in God for I
[10:23] shall yet praise him for the help of his
[10:27] countenance o my god o my soul that has
[10:31] cast down within me therefore will I
[10:34] remember thee in the land of Jordan and
[10:37] the herm rights and the heel of mizar
[10:40] deep calleth unto the deep at the noise
[10:44] of that water spouts all thy waves and
[10:48] billows are gone over me yet the Lord
[10:51] will command his loving-kindness in the
[10:54] daytime and and then the night his song
[10:56] shall be with me and my prayer unto God
[11:01] of my life and I will say unto God
[11:05] my rock why has thou forgotten me think
[11:11] about what he is going through to be
[11:14] able to write this song
[11:18] why go I'm mourning because of the
[11:22] oppression of my of the of the enemy
[11:24] that's with a sword in my bones mine
[11:28] enemies reproach me
[11:30] while they daily say daily unto me where
[11:35] is that God why art thou cast down O my
[11:39] soul and why art thou disquieted within
[11:42] me hope thou in God for I shall yet
[11:46] praise Him who is the health of my
[11:50] countenance and my god and my God he's
[11:58] not your God until you make him your God
[12:04] Genesis chapter 3 in verse 5 this is a
[12:09] very powerful portion of scripture it
[12:12] will be part of the redemption for God
[12:17] that note that in the day that you eat
[12:19] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[12:23] and ye shall be as God's knowing good
[12:27] and evil
[12:28] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[12:33] good for food that it was pleasant to
[12:36] the eyes and the tree to be desired to
[12:38] make one wise she took the fruit thereof
[12:42] and did eat and gave also under a
[12:45] husband with her and he did it and the
[12:50] eyes of them both were opened and they
[12:54] knew that they were naked and they sewed
[12:56] fig leaves together and made themselves
[12:59] aprons now once you just notice these
[13:02] next words and they heard the voice of
[13:05] the Lord God walking in the garden of
[13:09] the cool of the day and Adam and his
[13:13] wife hid themselves in the presence of
[13:16] the Lord God amongst the
[13:18] of the garden and the Lord God called
[13:24] unto Adam and said unto Him where art
[13:28] thou where art thou
[13:36] I'd like to take you to when before that
[13:39] there was even a man on the earth when
[13:44] I'm when I bein that was created even
[13:47] co-equal except for in creation his name
[13:52] was Lucifer the Sun of the morning and
[13:56] he deceived a third part of the angels
[13:58] that was in heaven with his tail and
[14:02] with his making himself God and he was
[14:09] cast from that place into this realm of
[14:13] Earth cast here it never moved God God
[14:20] never moved in the act of redemption he
[14:26] never moved out of that spot in the act
[14:28] of redemption but when one son failed
[14:34] when one son fell millions and millions
[14:40] of angels fell and was cast into another
[14:43] room never lose God and never moved God
[14:48] but when one son how important is one
[14:57] are you with me
[14:59] how important are you tonight in God's
[15:05] great book your name is there just as
[15:10] important as item one one son of God
[15:16] fell in the Garden of Eden God came
[15:19] running through the garden
[15:22] kind of running through the garden Adam
[15:26] where art thou Adam hit himself it's
[15:33] interesting that man hides himself from
[15:37] the only source of life that there is he
[15:42] is the only source of life he's the only
[15:44] source of eternal life are you with me
[15:48] now how many times the enemy when he
[15:52] deceives you had pulls you aside and
[15:54] begins to whisper in your ears he wants
[15:56] to isolate you away from the presence of
[15:58] God and that's the last thing that we
[16:00] should do I heard the voice in the
[16:08] garden and I was afraid because I was
[16:14] naked and hid myself David would write
[16:20] it like this in second chronicles
[16:21] chapter 7 in verse 12 and the Lord
[16:25] appeared to Solomon by night and said
[16:29] unto him I have heard thy prayer and
[16:31] have chosen displaced to myself for a
[16:35] house of sacrifice if I shut up heaven
[16:39] and there be no rain or if I command the
[16:42] locusts to devour the land or if I send
[16:45] pestilence among my people if my people
[16:49] notice these words if my people which
[16:53] are called by my name shall humble
[16:56] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[16:59] turn from their wicked ways then when I
[17:04] hear from heaven and will forgive their
[17:07] sin and will heal their land what a
[17:13] powerful scripture Romans chapter 6 and
[17:16] verse 12 Paul would say it like this let
[17:21] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[17:24] body somebody is going to be king
[17:30] somebody's going to be king no man can
[17:33] serve two masters
[17:34] at the same time somebody is going to be
[17:38] the king door you life I choose King
[17:40] Jesus I'd like to have a vote tonight I
[17:44] choose King Jesus hallelujah in that
[17:58] spot he's never failed me he's never
[18:01] made a promise that he couldn't keep man
[18:05] make promises and man makes all kind of
[18:08] boasts but God never misses are you with
[18:14] me never forgets a promise are you with
[18:17] me and he's got the assets in the bank
[18:20] to take care of every need
[18:22] the scripture says my God shall supply
[18:24] all I saw Andrew in the back raise up a
[18:33] prayer list I raised up a prayer list
[18:36] this last week at brother Joe greens and
[18:39] some of your names was on it and I
[18:43] raised that up let me just say this you
[18:47] that's a prayer list that God can handle
[18:51] I just encourage you make a list raise
[18:58] it before a god that can handle your
[19:00] list there's nothing that you can find
[19:05] them in your imagination that God can
[19:08] take care of are you with me now neither
[19:14] yield your ye your members that your
[19:18] eyes your ears your tongue your thoughts
[19:24] neither yet yielding your instruments as
[19:28] unrighteousness unto sin but yield
[19:31] yourselves unto God the the eyes that
[19:35] you have turned them us turning to Jesus
[19:40] Christ the ears I heard brother Andrew
[19:43] last week our ears are not trashcans our
[19:49] ears are not trashcans they're they're
[19:51] not a place to where that that you need
[19:53] to hear everybody's problems and it used
[19:56] to be inquiry there was an inquiring
[19:59] that maybe still out there but today
[20:01] it's blogs Facebook's and instagrams and
[20:04] all kind of media that comes your way
[20:06] and peep seems like people want to dump
[20:09] I don't I don't get involved in those
[20:10] things but seems like people just want
[20:12] to dump all of their issues and all
[20:14] their problems and their bad days let me
[20:16] just say this you lift up your eyes I
[20:26] live here well I'm afraid somebody will
[20:30] rain on my parade let me just say with
[20:32] Jesus with Jesus every day is a sunshiny
[20:37] day
[20:41] come on as those that are alive from the
[20:48] dead and your members as instruments of
[20:50] righteousness unto God say brother Ron
[20:53] God brings rain caught bring sunshine
[20:55] God brings all different kinds of things
[20:57] let me just say this even noon he knows
[21:00] the seasons but if Jesus is gonna reign
[21:02] on me I'll take all his blessings they
[21:04] call them angel tears I'll take them for
[21:07] sin hath no not shall not have dominion
[21:13] over you I like that let's just say it
[21:17] how it is that's a Christian sin does
[21:20] not reign over me sin is not my boss
[21:26] since not my boss hallelujah since not
[21:33] my boss for a year not under the law but
[21:39] under grace I love that don't you I just
[21:47] absolutely love that with all my heart
[21:50] now I believe different cycles or
[21:54] different levels in my life and I'll
[21:56] just I'll be shared this with you for
[21:58] the carnal realm just for a moment
[22:00] because sometimes that's where we are
[22:02] and then sometimes we get lifted as a
[22:04] service goes on but I remember when I
[22:07] first worked and I was first in a
[22:09] situation to where I was just one of the
[22:12] boys that was working in at the radford
[22:14] Arsenal I hear people's murmuring and
[22:17] complaining and their fussing and all of
[22:21] their griping and I'd hear those things
[22:23] but I just went about doing my job and
[22:25] I'd hear them talk about the bosses and
[22:28] you know everything was the boss's fault
[22:30] and everybody whoever it was of
[22:32] company's fault but but I always I've
[22:35] always had this mentality if they didn't
[22:39] need me to work
[22:43] they would have not heard me they don't
[22:46] need me for my looks but I'm gonna
[22:52] preach to you you might as well you came
[22:54] in you sit down you read it they don't
[23:01] need you just because of your physical
[23:03] form you're there to do a job in our
[23:08] media today we we have sports stars that
[23:11] complain about they're only making 20
[23:13] million a year or 3 million a year and
[23:17] they're they're sacrificing their body
[23:20] and and they just won't play unless they
[23:22] they get more money
[23:24] it'll only put them further in hell
[23:30] they've sold himself to slavery you see
[23:33] slavery is not done they complain about
[23:35] Thomas Jefferson owning slaves yet he
[23:38] writes he writes that every man should
[23:40] be free and there's all kind of warriors
[23:44] about that now since slavery is not a
[23:46] it's not a race deal slavery is not a
[23:55] race deal it's a human bill and I would
[24:00] say to not that probably be a good
[24:05] amount of you were slaves to even debt
[24:10] you knew I'd come to your house a credit
[24:14] card can make you a slave a nice car can
[24:18] make you a slave a nice house can make
[24:21] you a slave attempt can make you a slave
[24:25] a fishing pole can make you a slate a
[24:29] rifle can make you a slave
[24:41] I won't just strategically want you to
[24:46] get this I want you to understand
[24:50] slavery takes on many forms we think of
[24:55] slavery in the Old Testament when the
[24:57] Jews became slaves to the Egyptians but
[25:02] if you remember it was the Egyptians
[25:06] that had them hired out at first to
[25:08] build their cities if you remember the
[25:12] Jews had the best land in Egypt if you
[25:16] remember there was always lightened
[25:19] ocean they had the most fertile fields
[25:22] because remember there was a blessing
[25:24] their father Abraham sat down with the
[25:27] king of Giroux and he commanded a
[25:31] blessing on the wherever they were so
[25:33] even in slavery in Egypt they had all
[25:37] the blessings are you with me so people
[25:47] can sit right in church and be slaves to
[25:49] sin
[25:51] many times it's secretly in and it's
[25:54] very just because of this realm of of
[25:57] everything that we're involved in today
[26:00] many times people can live undercover
[26:02] sin that even their mates don't know
[26:05] about but let there be light may the God
[26:17] of the garden of your life come none of
[26:21] us want our name called out I believe
[26:23] God delivery was a nice way that he
[26:26] dealt with brother Donnie last night
[26:28] maybe for some of you as an audience
[26:30] you've seen the dead raised you've seen
[26:33] incredible miracles as an audience for
[26:37] brother Donnie last night God just
[26:39] reminded him that he was going to pay
[26:42] all death
[26:45] and he had him in his mind yet Satan
[26:50] Wars making offers even offers to where
[26:56] in our thoughts
[27:01] it seems enticing and can we do both now
[27:08] let me just say this to you that's not
[27:09] just to brother Donnie or to one of you
[27:13] brother Branham had to deal with that
[27:18] brother branham wanted to get away from
[27:20] the pressures of people he enjoyed the
[27:23] next Northwest Territories of Canada and
[27:26] he preaches a couple of sermons one of
[27:29] them a man running from the presence of
[27:32] the Lord why does a man want to get in a
[27:35] cabin thousands of miles away from
[27:37] anybody else maybe take his wife and his
[27:39] children there knowing they can't
[27:42] prosper in that kind of an atmosphere
[27:43] but he could get away from the pressures
[27:46] of humanity he enjoys not having to
[27:49] change his clothes and not have to take
[27:52] a bath and enjoys hunting and he enjoys
[27:55] being a a man of manners when you dear
[27:58] brother I'm talking about a real man
[28:00] he's not a man of great stature a man
[28:03] with big muscles but then walks into a
[28:05] restaurant and he hears a man sneeze and
[28:09] he said that's a real man here's brother
[28:22] branham has already saw the little boy
[28:24] in finland come back to laugh he has
[28:27] seen the girl in jonesboro her blonde
[28:30] eyes come open and I'm going to mention
[28:33] even her and Georgia Carter he has he
[28:36] has witnessed some of the most
[28:38] phenomenal teachings of the scriptures
[28:41] come open to the Gentile bride and yet
[28:44] he wants to be an Old Testament prophet
[28:46] and come down out of the mountains when
[28:49] God speaks to him and tell the people
[28:51] then then go back and God has to stop
[28:53] him
[28:55] and tell him if you do what your plan is
[28:58] your wife will leave you your children
[29:01] will leave you
[29:16] now I ask you the question God left
[29:21] brother branham can you pick it up
[29:25] anywhere in the sermons were he said I I
[29:28] didn't feel the anointing for six months
[29:33] I've been a listener for all these years
[29:35] I don't believe I I don't believe I can
[29:39] find it but he had to press forward I'm
[29:43] saying these things for a reason
[29:45] sometimes it seems like God's a million
[29:47] miles away that don't mean you quit that
[29:54] don't mean you come to a spot so I throw
[29:56] my hands up and I'm done here you press
[30:01] on if you remember what brother Branham
[30:06] said that spot was he said there was a
[30:09] girl that was that that that he prayed
[30:12] for and he thought she would get well
[30:15] and that girl died and he told God you
[30:22] owe me an apology
[30:24] have you ever had a prayer that you
[30:27] thought didn't work out like you thought
[30:30] it would and you get mad at God well
[30:33] you're not on your own you're not only
[30:35] her hope you're not by yourself at times
[30:38] God you owe me an apology and he said he
[30:41] left me he left me he was teaching his
[30:52] prophetess a lesson I'm the boss
[30:57] I'm the boss I'm the boss it's when we
[31:03] think we're the boss I'm preaching to
[31:06] Laodicea here people's rights they
[31:09] protest over everything in the world
[31:13] everybody's willing to raise up a sign
[31:15] or fuss or or do this or do that or at
[31:27] the end of the day he's the boss he's
[31:35] King
[31:35] and we're service not spoke to him and
[31:41] after about six months he brother BAM
[31:44] says about six months he said God showed
[31:47] him that a year before this girl's
[31:50] sickness that girl was drowning and
[31:55] here's my sermon and she screamed for
[32:00] help an interest scream for help God
[32:06] heard her prayer and God rescued her it
[32:14] wasn't her time yet it wasn't her time
[32:18] yet in the condition that she was in she
[32:22] was not ready to make heaven her home
[32:25] but a year later she had that had things
[32:29] prepared are you with me brother Branham
[32:36] baptized the man that was a smoker of
[32:38] cigarettes and and people in his
[32:40] congregation got all excited and all
[32:42] upset and they said you baptize a man
[32:45] that was unsanctified and and he wasn't
[32:48] living right he said you're not God oh
[32:53] [Music]
[32:55] brother run but this or that let me just
[32:58] say God sees will way beyond our mortal
[33:02] eyes
[33:06] I'm really thankful for that the
[33:13] scripture said that His mercy endureth
[33:16] forever his mercy endureth forever his
[33:23] mercy endures forever Paul says it like
[33:32] this Oh wretched man that I am Who Shall
[33:37] deliver me from the from this body of
[33:39] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[33:42] our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[33:45] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[33:48] the law of sin the next scripture he
[33:51] writes therefore there is now no
[33:54] condemnation
[33:56] we're not Catholics we don't beat
[33:58] ourselves every day we don't send our
[34:01] yourself through purgatory over and over
[34:04] again we purge out the sin of our lives
[34:07] we deal with acid as it comes up but
[34:11] we'll not let it reign over top of us it
[34:15] doesn't give us a license to go back and
[34:17] do it over and over and over again to
[34:25] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[34:27] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[34:29] for the law of the law of the spirit of
[34:32] life is in Christ and Jesus Christ says
[34:35] Christ Jesus hath made me free from the
[34:39] law of sin and death I say it would say
[34:42] it like this what was me I'm a man of
[34:45] unclean lips and I dwell amongst of
[34:48] people thunder and god the angel of God
[34:53] took the tongues of the four coal from
[34:54] off of the altar and laid it upon him
[34:57] and he would then write a commentary of
[35:02] the entire Bible why because he was
[35:06] living amongst unclean people no because
[35:08] God touched him
[35:13] Jeremiah 17 in verse 14 says heal me O
[35:17] Lord I shall be healed
[35:21] save me and I shall be saved for thou
[35:25] art my praise Psalm 6 verse 2 have mercy
[35:29] upon me O Lord for I am weak O Lord heal
[35:35] me for my bones are vexed Psalms 91 in
[35:39] verse 1 you hear it almost every service
[35:41] he is my refuge and my fortress oh my
[35:46] god in him all our trust
[35:49] I love this scripture 2nd chronicles
[35:57] chapter 20 and verse 15 and I'm just
[36:01] going to jump down in the middle of it
[36:02] thus saith the Lord unto you be not
[36:05] afraid nor dismayed by reason of this
[36:08] great multitude for the battle is not
[36:11] yours are you with me for the battle is
[36:18] not yours but gosh where do I get in
[36:26] trouble fight my own battles where do
[36:29] you get in trouble brother Nathaniel do
[36:35] you ever get in trouble because you
[36:37] fought your battles and then God whips
[36:39] you because you fought your battles and
[36:41] he told you it's it's my battle never
[36:46] happen to you ever happen to you
[36:55] all you ended on something so simple
[36:57] last night I'm raising a white flag yet
[37:00] it's the first Christian principle of
[37:02] the Christian it's sin Rinda raising
[37:06] your hands before God is a sign of
[37:08] surrender but don't forget it
[37:13] just because you surrender 40 years ago
[37:16] don't mean you need to not need to do to
[37:18] do it today verse 17 of that same
[37:25] chapter you shall not need to fight in
[37:27] this battle set yourself and stand still
[37:30] and see the salvation of the Lord with
[37:33] you all Judah and Jerusalem fear not for
[37:37] gospel lighthouse fear not nor be
[37:40] dismayed tomorrow go out against them
[37:44] for the Lord will be with you well Ron I
[38:03] got a difficult week like in the playing
[38:04] ahead of me
[38:05] or at this point you just stop and thank
[38:08] God that God's got this service designed
[38:10] to let you know you're not alone
[38:17] whatever your business whatever your
[38:20] your hospital whatever your situation
[38:25] you're not alone young people when you
[38:28] go to school you're not alone I'm the
[38:32] only one in my school you're forgetting
[38:33] the picture in another room Stan's
[38:35] thousands of angels at charge to watch
[38:38] over that deposited seed of God I'm the
[38:42] only one in my school dresses like that
[38:43] hallelujah he didn't have to put a
[38:46] thousand people around you to prop you
[38:48] up and make everything easy for you
[38:50] God's got confidence in you
[38:52] [Applause]
[38:58] glory to God I want to remind you the
[39:05] scripture young people no weapon that is
[39:08] formed against thee no weapon that is
[39:12] formed against thee shall prosper and
[39:15] every tongue that shall stand at your
[39:17] eyes against thee in judgment thou shalt
[39:22] convene
[39:25] sticks and stones may break my bones but
[39:27] words can never hurt me don't you kid
[39:29] yourself words sometimes pierc'd even to
[39:34] your heart and you remember that four
[39:36] years down the road somebody tell you're
[39:39] fat and you're obese you'll remember
[39:41] that person the rest of your life you're
[39:45] ugly you're nasty you're all different
[39:47] kind of things those words pierce even
[39:49] into your heart and you may act like I
[39:51] bounce that off you're real you're a
[39:53] human being pinch yourself if you don't
[39:54] think am I talking to the right audience
[40:01] here
[40:03] [Applause]
[40:11] further on but I just can't hold my
[40:13] tongue sometimes nasty things come out
[40:15] the recent nasty things come out it's
[40:17] because there's not a Holy Ghost ranking
[40:19] down on your heart and nasty things come
[40:23] from nasty fountains somebody help me
[40:31] preach nasty things come from nasty
[40:34] fountains and the reason little words
[40:37] seem to just slip out of your mouth
[40:39] because the real king is not on your
[40:41] heart get born again whether on my
[40:46] temper gets way out of control go on
[40:48] your knees it's hard for your temper to
[40:53] get out of control on your knees
[41:28] I went to a place one time and God spoke
[41:41] to me to preach on the autopsy of a dead
[41:43] church you know some sermons are
[41:48] difficult to to preach some sermons are
[41:51] sometimes you you just walk to the
[41:54] pulpit and you go well Lord here it is
[41:58] and I preached to about 40 people with
[42:02] an audience with a building structure
[42:04] that would seat about 400 I preached I
[42:15] didn't know anybody but the pastor I
[42:17] preached at the end of that sermon one
[42:22] man made his way to the altar I'm not
[42:26] gonna call his name I spent about an
[42:30] hour praying with that man I just felt
[42:39] led to stay
[42:42] I got done most of the people were gone
[42:46] I walked into the pastor steady the
[42:48] pastor was sitting at the desk and he
[42:51] was he was back in his chair and he has
[42:54] his hands behind his head and he was
[42:57] appalled he was literally appalled he
[43:00] just didn't know what to make of it I
[43:04] went in the washroom
[43:06] changed my shirt walked out I was
[43:09] driving home it was a about a 12 hour
[43:12] drive home he looked up at me and he
[43:19] said you don't know who you just prayed
[43:22] for word for an hour I said I don't care
[43:26] one of the richest men I've ever known
[43:29] in my life I'm talking about money real
[43:31] money real money but he needed God it
[43:42] didn't matter that he owned a bunch of
[43:44] companies I don't matter to me it
[43:46] shouldn't matter to you God's no
[43:49] respecter of person but he said in the
[43:52] service of about 40 people that man
[43:55] became one of my biggest friends in my
[44:02] life he's gone now but he became one of
[44:04] my biggest friends I'd go preach in the
[44:08] area and he set right beside of me
[44:10] because he could go back to a night to
[44:13] where I preached a sermon and he didn't
[44:16] matter what his status was or what his
[44:17] financial condition is because let me
[44:20] just say it don't matter what your name
[44:21] is your status is
[44:32] random in all of his busyness of life
[44:36] reminds himself our selves of when he
[44:39] was a 14 year old boy he got shot and
[44:48] here's what his first statements are and
[44:51] I want some things to just stick with us
[44:53] and after the vision struck me I was so
[44:58] weak I'd lost all that blood and I went
[45:01] till I was sinking into an endless
[45:03] eternity many of you heard me tell this
[45:07] before and sinking into an endless
[45:11] eternity many of you he said I was going
[45:16] through like clouds then through
[45:19] darkness and sinking on down down down
[45:23] down and the first thing you know I got
[45:28] to the regions of the lost I screamed
[45:33] and I looked every word just everything
[45:36] and there was no foundation to it I
[45:41] could never stop falling a few years ago
[45:51] I fell 40 feet and I fell on concrete
[45:56] and I still suffer from anxiety of that
[46:02] falling because I will experience it and
[46:05] I'll catch myself where I'm driving down
[46:08] the road or on I'm going through a
[46:10] normal day all the sudden I'm falling
[46:12] and I can't catch myself
[46:14] you see even in 40 feet there's nothing
[46:16] to grab ahold of just nothing to grab
[46:20] the hotel I cannot imagine falling 40
[46:25] falling through an endless eternity
[46:29] folks you don't have to go to hell
[46:32] I don't want I don't think I've got it
[46:36] worst enemy but I don't want even my
[46:38] Nana me
[46:42] I want nobody to experience ten minutes
[46:48] of Hell Billy Andrews would say this if
[46:54] we could have a glimpse of hell and
[46:56] maybe hold you over it feels few seconds
[46:59] we'd have the greatest author called in
[47:00] the world but God don't steer you to an
[47:03] altar God pulls you to an altar brother
[47:15] Branham sees things there that no person
[47:19] should have to hear he hear screams he
[47:22] hears news and ahhs and he sees the
[47:27] hairstyles of today in the painted faces
[47:29] of today and and remember everybody in
[47:32] Hell is naked and remember everybody in
[47:36] Hell is in the body that they sin been
[47:41] no parties no friends there's not a
[47:45] friend in Hell get aside from the
[47:49] illusion you you you must stand before
[47:51] an angry god that turned you've turned
[47:55] down his mercy but I want to scream -
[47:58] yes or not no matter where you're at in
[48:01] life and no matter how sins got a hope
[48:04] to you and lied and trapped you and
[48:06] enslave you and you think you've got to
[48:09] stay there you don't have to stay there
[48:18] oh I wish so-and-so was here I do too
[48:28] I wish this person was here to hear that
[48:33] I do too
[48:34] I wish that I could preach to the world
[48:38] now
[48:55] I was at the fair Friday and someone
[49:03] called me their pastor they don't dress
[49:05] like it it didn't give me a license to
[49:09] to treat them bad I treated him good
[49:16] someone asked me said what do you think
[49:18] I said I pray that there's a merciful
[49:19] God thinking about this sermon tonight
[49:25] what would you trade with your soul
[49:31] what would you trade your soul for
[49:38] temporary pleasure another man another
[49:45] woman let me just say if you trade your
[49:48] soul you're going to be real
[49:48] disappointed another man snores like the
[49:54] man you had to force knows other men
[50:02] have other mistakes why would you I
[50:09] don't care if it's Miss America she's
[50:12] eight up with worms 24 hours hours after
[50:18] she dies she's full of worms baby
[50:23] marilyn monroe's of this world they go
[50:26] to a coroner's office but in hell if she
[50:33] could look back she'd like to get the
[50:37] adultery since still going on against
[50:39] her to stop
[50:42] jesus said to richmond and in hell he
[50:44] wanted to come back and evangelize his
[50:46] brothers brother homer one of his
[50:51] favorite subjects he said if i could
[50:52] only go back if i could only go back
[51:15] there's things that haunt me as a
[51:17] preacher haunt me voices that haunt me
[51:31] now I'm preaching from my heart if I
[51:36] could save them I would if you could you
[51:45] would and I want to make a statement
[51:48] here we can go to a funeral homes to say
[51:51] I pray they're in a better place and I
[51:55] pray they are but there's a reality here
[52:01] if you're not born again I don't care
[52:08] what the last name is
[52:27] there was a little girl in Milltown that
[52:30] lived with a family that didn't believe
[52:32] God would heal she went to a church that
[52:36] didn't believe God healed she had been
[52:41] because of uncle molested her as a
[52:45] little girl
[52:46] it left a disease on her and that
[52:51] disease crippled that little girl she
[52:54] laid in bed for almost 10 years about
[53:02] the ninth year three years after doctor
[53:07] said they couldn't do no more for she
[53:10] was weigh in about 37 pounds she was in
[53:14] a condition to word that they no longer
[53:17] cleaned her body but they put rubber
[53:20] sheets under her and she excreted from
[53:23] the herself and they would change the
[53:26] rubber sheets and leave her in that
[53:29] putrified condition but somebody gave
[53:33] her a book somebody gave her a book and
[53:40] in that weakened condition she read that
[53:43] God's healing
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:56] I want to pull some things too for you
[53:59] brother random said when I was in hell I
[54:00] screamed and there was no daddy there
[54:02] was no mama the girl in jonesboro she
[54:06] screaming out amongst that crowd where's
[54:09] my daddy where's my daughter
[54:12] grab the whole cup brother branham's
[54:14] lapels and said if you can get me to the
[54:18] healer I can find my daughter are you
[54:22] with me you may not have the strength to
[54:24] scream tonight but is there anybody that
[54:29] can hear is there anybody can hear my
[54:41] cry brother on you don't know my
[54:53] situation
[55:07] god this when I hear when I go in a
[55:13] nursing home and I hear old people
[55:16] screaming help me help me somebody help
[55:22] me
[55:24] nurses can't fix that doctors can't fix
[55:27] that but there's a God there's a God
[55:33] that hears there was a woman sitting in
[55:38] a prison house and she'd been invited to
[55:41] a church meeting and the preacher
[55:43] preaches seemed oblique to like to an
[55:45] audience that didn't respond and finally
[55:47] toward the end of the service a man
[55:49] screams Savior please don't pass me by
[55:53] and a woman that was blonde pinned a
[55:57] song Savior Savior blind funny crossed
[56:04] me pinned that song and it's been some
[56:06] millions and millions and millions of
[56:09] times she never made a dime on it in her
[56:12] life but there's a reward that's going
[56:25] I want to ask us audience honestly have
[56:29] you ever been to a spot to where it
[56:31] seemed like nobody could hear you then
[56:38] this sermon is for you last night was
[56:43] the platform and two knots the sermon
[56:46] then this sermon is for you
[56:52] now you see to walk this road you've had
[56:57] to live this road and understand being a
[57:02] spot because choices made me to the spot
[57:05] that it was and I was in the bottom
[57:07] doing drugs and it looked like there was
[57:10] no way out and I heard a voice that
[57:15] asked me where are you and I responded
[57:21] to that voice and I said lord if it's
[57:24] you helped me to get out of this in 24
[57:29] hours God opened the door on the Left
[57:34] all my belongings and I left and I went
[57:37] out come on church
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:46] somewhere down the road I heard a voice
[57:49] and it was more than my mom and daddy it
[57:52] was God God came to me when I had when I
[57:58] put myself when I put myself in some
[58:04] situations that I shouldn't be in let me
[58:06] say let the voice from this pulpit
[58:08] scream out God says I hear you you know
[58:20] the vision you know the fulfillment but
[58:26] somewhere another girl the girl laid
[58:28] there over nine years that she had wrung
[58:30] the varnish off of the post of the bed
[58:35] beyond desperation the critical pain in
[58:39] way of thirty seven pounds at that point
[58:42] it seemed like no hope was that but God
[58:46] sent a prophet that would preach such
[58:50] phenomenal things in life and spending
[58:52] phenomenal pulpits God remembered a
[58:55] voice in Milltown are you listening to
[59:03] help that woman never became rich that
[59:08] woman never lived in a mansion but God
[59:10] raised that woman back up to health and
[59:14] she lived an old age some of your family
[59:18] lives very close to her I don't know if
[59:19] you even know that or not brother
[59:21] William but some of your family actually
[59:22] lives right you're actually going pretty
[59:25] close to where she lived she'll never
[59:31] make the who's who she probably never
[59:36] hardly made minimum money but God
[59:40] remember
[59:42] I want to read one quote brother Ben sis
[59:54] and I look back there and I said here a
[59:56] few days ago I was down there and I
[59:59] looked at that little Obed she took me
[1:00:03] in to show it to her there she was where
[1:00:07] the paint was rubbed off all the rounds
[1:00:09] and right there were year after year
[1:00:13] laying hollering crying begging holding
[1:00:20] on to that rub the pain off of her
[1:00:21] bedpost but God heard her cry no matter
[1:00:31] what she was raised in God will move you
[1:00:44] just sit still and let God do it have
[1:00:48] faith in Him he'll work it out
[1:01:04] a little woman was dying she knew he was
[1:01:11] God
[1:01:12] that's the barrel went down and down and
[1:01:15] down in circumstances got worse and
[1:01:17] worse all the time
[1:01:18] but God was letting it get that way he
[1:01:22] loves to do that he loves to put your
[1:01:23] faith to a test to see how you act on it
[1:01:25] and let you be anointed and prayed and
[1:01:29] then makes it worse come on Satan put
[1:01:32] him to a test I know he believes me
[1:01:34] blessed God forever hold my put him to a
[1:01:36] test to know I know I know he took my
[1:01:40] word for it could he say that about you
[1:01:43] he said that about joke do anything to
[1:01:46] him you want to but don't take his life
[1:01:49] for I know he loves me he made a burnt
[1:01:51] offering he made his requirements he did
[1:01:54] and I told him and he believes it roll
[1:01:57] him over in the coals if you have to he
[1:02:00] he took everything away for him and God
[1:02:03] doubled it when he gave it back to him
[1:02:08] he puts your faith to a test to see if
[1:02:10] you really believe that he is gone that
[1:02:12] little woman no doubt said I prayed and
[1:02:15] I prayed and I know I'm an unworthy
[1:02:17] Gentile and you remember Jesus spoke of
[1:02:20] her in the Bible and he said was it he
[1:02:22] said one of their many widows in the
[1:02:25] days of Elijah but he sent only sent him
[1:02:29] to one and she was a Gentile he said I
[1:02:35] prayed and maybe when he seen that last
[1:02:39] little cake and yes had already entered
[1:02:44] into the gate and come to the door one
[1:02:49] little bag a cake a piece and she and
[1:02:52] her son would have died and I can see
[1:02:54] her all not praying
[1:02:55] hot winds are blowing and earth parched
[1:02:57] and people crying and screaming in the
[1:02:59] streets she walked around through the
[1:03:01] house and looked at a little bitty boy
[1:03:03] look at his pajamas and they were all
[1:03:05] out and his little feet sticking out and
[1:03:07] lifted his hands and walked back and
[1:03:09] forth I said I know that he's gone and I
[1:03:12] made in my confession
[1:03:14] things that he's required and I'm asking
[1:03:16] him for our lives for his golden God
[1:03:24] seen her got a few more minutes last us
[1:03:50] come forth he spoke and her dead band
[1:03:52] come forth not Tana he just spoke when

[1:13:13] life

[1:13:25] needs Lord before a meeting can come and

[1:13:38] gospel praying and dedicating themselves
[1:13:41] before the Lord I heard brother Tim the
