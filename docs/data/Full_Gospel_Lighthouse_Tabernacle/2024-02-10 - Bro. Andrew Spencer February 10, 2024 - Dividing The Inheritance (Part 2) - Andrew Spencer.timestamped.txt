[45:06] such a way and now God we just want to
[45:09] be careful father that you'd have your
[45:11] Liberty here tonight you begin to
[45:13] minister to your people in the name of
[45:16] Jesus Christ amen amen if you have your
[45:19] Bibles this evening we'd like to look
[45:21] over in the book of Ephesians chapter 1
[45:24] and verse three and Joshua chapter 1
[45:27] verse three as
[45:29] well i' like to say we want to welcome
[45:31] all of our visitors here this evening
[45:34] and say God richly bless
[45:37] you it's an honor to be with you in the
[45:40] presence of the Lord is the greatest
[45:43] part of each and every one of our weeks
[45:45] to to be able to gather ourselves and
[45:48] assemble ourselves as we see the day
[45:50] approaching us and just want
[45:53] to make you aware that after for this
[45:56] service tonight we'll be having uh
[45:58] communion tonight be taking of the
[46:00] Lord's Supper so brother Ron will come
[46:02] after the preaching of the word and
[46:04] deliver the communion service this
[46:06] evening and so we're just looking unto
[46:08] the Lord and we recognize that it is our
[46:11] duty to fulfill these ordin ordinances
[46:13] and so we just want to reverence our
[46:16] heart and we know that the Bible tells
[46:18] us in 1 Corinthians in chapter 11 that
[46:21] that the reason why there's many sick
[46:23] amongst you and and many sleep among you
[46:26] is because they don't discern the Lord's
[46:27] body so we want to be very careful to
[46:29] discern the Lord's body and we want to
[46:31] reverence everything that we do here we
[46:33] want to be very respectful about the
[46:35] house of the Lord but we want to enjoy
[46:38] his presence as well amen so you just
[46:41] exam examine yourself while the word is
[46:43] going forth and make sure your life is
[46:45] in line with those things and I believe
[46:47] that special Miracles can take place at
[46:50] the at Communion services and so so
[46:54] we're just looking unto the Lord tonight
[46:55] tonight Ephesians chap 1 and verse three
[46:59] blessed be the God and father of our
[47:02] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[47:05] with all spiritual blessings let's say
[47:07] that together with all spiritual
[47:10] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[47:13] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[47:16] before the foundation of the world that
[47:19] we should be holy and Without Blame
[47:21] before him in love having predestinated
[47:25] us under the adoption of children by
[47:27] Jesus Christ to himself now brother
[47:29] Brandon would say that that word is a
[47:32] very hard word that predestinate it
[47:34] because it scared a lot of
[47:36] denominationalism away because they
[47:38] didn't fully understand it but that's a
[47:39] that's a that's a bride word right there
[47:42] having predestinated us under the
[47:44] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[47:46] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:49] of his will if you didn't fully
[47:51] understand or didn't grasp the power of
[47:53] predestination and you didn't believe in
[47:54] it I'd hate to be you amen but I'm glad
[47:58] to be me and understand the power of
[48:00] predestination also Joshua chap 1 and
[48:03] verse three and before we before we read
[48:06] that I'd like to share with you this
[48:08] quote from the message adoption brother
[48:10] brandham said he said oh let's just stop
[48:13] one more minute
[48:14] here referring back to Ephesians here he
[48:17] said in Heavenly places now just not out
[48:20] anywhere but in Heavenly places not just
[48:23] out anywhere but in Heavenly places he
[48:25] said we are assembled in Heavenly it
[48:28] means that the p position of the
[48:31] believer that if I'm prayed up and
[48:33] you're prayed up or the church is prayed
[48:35] up and we're ready for the message and
[48:37] we've assembled ourselves together as
[48:40] Saints called out baptized with the Holy
[48:42] Ghost filled with God's blessings called
[48:44] elected set together in Heavenly places
[48:47] now we are Heavenly heavenlies in our
[48:50] souls our spirit has brought us in the
[48:53] Heavenly atmosphere oh brother that
[48:55] there you are there you are a Heavenly
[48:58] atmosphere oh what could happen tonight
[49:01] what could happen tonight if we would be
[49:03] setting here in in a Heavenly atmosphere
[49:06] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[49:08] heart that's been regenerated and become
[49:11] a new creature in Christ Jesus amen
[49:15] Joshua chapter 1 and verse three every
[49:18] place that the soul of your foot shall
[49:20] tread upon that have I given unto you as
[49:23] I said unto Moses from the Wilderness
[49:26] and this Lebanon even under the Great
[49:28] River the river Euphrates all the land
[49:31] of the Hittites and under the great sea
[49:33] toward the going down of the sun shall
[49:35] be your Coast there shall not any man be
[49:38] able to stand before thee all the days
[49:40] of thy life as I was with Moses so I
[49:43] will be with thee I will not fail thee
[49:46] nor forsake thee perfectly in line
[49:50] brother brother Shannon be strong and of
[49:52] a good courage for under this people
[49:55] Shout thou divide an inheritance the
[49:57] land which I swear under their fathers
[50:00] to give them may God's blessings be upon
[50:02] the reading of the word you may be
[50:04] seated in the presence of the Lord again
[50:06] we'd like to take a thought this weekend
[50:08] and carry on our thought from last
[50:10] weekend on dividing dividing The
[50:13] Inheritance and we understand that by
[50:15] the preaching of the message in this
[50:17] last day Ministry that Jesus is our
[50:20] Joshua that Jesus is our Joshua so we
[50:25] recognize immediately that the God that
[50:27] was with Joshua is the god that is with
[50:29] us today so we understand that by the
[50:31] preaching or the anointing of the hour
[50:33] that we are living in that we are here
[50:36] that that with what the leadership that
[50:38] we are under is the leadership of our
[50:41] Lord Jesus Christ and just like you
[50:42] would type it with Joshua under his
[50:45] generation so you can type it in this
[50:47] generation that Jesus Christ just like
[50:50] Joshua was the power that was moving the
[50:53] children of Israel along their Journeys
[50:55] that that Jesus is the general that
[50:58] Jesus is the moving power that is in the
[51:01] Church of the Living God and you can go
[51:03] throughout all the Old Testament you can
[51:05] go throughout the first five books of of
[51:07] the Bible of the Torah there and you can
[51:08] see that every time that the children of
[51:11] God would move they would move by the
[51:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost they were
[51:15] led by the pillar of fire and as we as
[51:17] we referenced it last weekend in Exodus
[51:20] chapter 23 and 20 the Bible said behold
[51:23] I send an angel before the to keep thee
[51:27] in the way and to bring thee into the
[51:29] place which I have prepared to bring
[51:32] thee into the place which I have
[51:34] prepared I heard a song this week about
[51:37] about a man or a Christian song and he
[51:39] was singing he said I don't really care
[51:41] what what the destiny is as long as the
[51:44] journey is with you Lord Jesus but I
[51:47] want you to know as the Church of the
[51:48] Living God that there is a place there
[51:51] is a place for the Church of the Living
[51:53] God and it is that place that the angel
[51:55] of the Lord has prepared to you do you
[51:57] recognize as as the Church of the Living
[51:59] God that you have a destiny a destiny a
[52:03] place that is prepared for you to think
[52:05] that tonight that there is a place that
[52:08] the Lord Jesus Christ has already set
[52:10] out there's a place by him tonight to
[52:12] know that there's a place by him Moses
[52:15] would look and he would see him when he
[52:16] was walking by the Cliff of the rock
[52:18] notice that God would say unto him he
[52:20] said there's a place by me when Jesus is
[52:23] hanging on the cross and there was there
[52:25] was one on his right side and one is on
[52:27] his left side and one ridiculed him but
[52:30] the one didn't mock him but he said Lord
[52:32] remember me there's a place there's a
[52:34] place by our lord Jesus and he's
[52:36] wondering who is going to take that
[52:38] place but to think that tonight no
[52:40] matter where you go no matter what you
[52:42] try to hide from or no matter what enemy
[52:45] might come up against you there's a
[52:47] place that you're destined unto you and
[52:49] there's not one devil in hell that can
[52:51] rob you from your destiny come on
[52:54] somebody I know there was an old group
[52:55] back in the day when I was a teenager
[52:57] they called it Destiny's Child but they
[52:59] had it completely wrong I'm the
[53:01] Destiny's Child I'm the son of Destiny
[53:04] because my Lord Jesus Christ has picked
[53:07] out my path he's picked out my plan and
[53:10] I know exactly where I'm
[53:12] going well how do you know that brother
[53:14] Andrew because I know what Jesus said he
[53:16] said I came from God and I go to God so
[53:19] I know that as long as I am a part of
[53:21] him and he's a part of me that I came
[53:24] from the mind of God and I'll go back to
[53:26] the mind of
[53:28] God brother random said election looks
[53:31] back to for knowledge and predestination
[53:33] looks on to Destiny he said don't forget
[53:35] that he said that election looks back
[53:38] here here it is he said I was a cooker
[53:40] he said I was born in sin I was shaped
[53:43] in iniquity and I come into the world
[53:44] speaking lies born amongst sinor Sinners
[53:47] and father and mother and all my family
[53:49] were Sinners I was a cooker he said but
[53:52] all of a sudden I became a weak grain he
[53:55] said how did it happen he said that was
[53:58] it he said election made it happen
[54:01] election made it happen you see you you
[54:04] brother Bandon would say it in 1964 in
[54:06] question and answers he said as long as
[54:08] you are here you are always going to
[54:10] have that sticky nature that cuck nature
[54:13] he said but the only way that that cuur
[54:16] could ever be a weak grain he said it I
[54:18] believe he said it like this he said
[54:20] that that wheat grain has to be
[54:22] transmitted on the inside of that cuur
[54:25] and he said the only way that it'll ever
[54:26] come out he said it's got to be buried
[54:29] and it's got to die in there he said
[54:31] that's the only way you can look like a
[54:32] cabur you can look like a cabur but if
[54:35] you've ever got if you ever got
[54:37] something transmitted to the part of
[54:40] your soul and you get buried in Jesus
[54:42] Christ it'll come to life so that sticky
[54:45] nature it'll always be grabbing against
[54:47] things I I pulled one of them little
[54:49] cucker burls off my dog this week she
[54:51] didn't like it too much she got the
[54:53] yelping and everything else but it
[54:55] remind me it reminded me about this old
[54:57] sticky nature that we got it clings on
[54:59] to things sometimes but remember that's
[55:02] not the real you the real you is what
[55:05] God deposited before the foundation of
[55:08] the world is that right now we realize
[55:12] that election has placed us where we are
[55:14] it wasn't anything that we did but it
[55:16] was his election and his grace that
[55:18] placed us where we are and you go to
[55:21] studying out the message and go looking
[55:22] out throughout the Bible you can find
[55:24] that over there that Moses took them as
[55:27] far as he could go is that right he took
[55:30] them as far as he could go in the land
[55:32] and you can study it out and you can
[55:33] think about you can think about
[55:34] scoffield would say it like this that it
[55:37] took them 13 months to get from Egypt
[55:40] all the way to cadesh Baria and it took
[55:43] them 38 years from cadesh Baria to enter
[55:45] into the promised land but they were
[55:48] simply only a couple weeks away from
[55:50] going in back there but to think that
[55:53] there there Moses could only take them
[55:55] so far he could only take them so far
[55:58] because it was not his ministry you know
[56:00] realize that there are capacities upon
[56:03] Ministries that they can only go so far
[56:06] they can only go so far and I I don't
[56:08] want to say this with disregard William
[56:10] brandom ran his race with everything
[56:12] that's within him but he can't run the
[56:14] race that you're running right now
[56:16] because he's not here he's in the grave
[56:18] but there's somebody that's going to
[56:20] pick
[56:21] up there's somebody that's going to pick
[56:23] up Moses's mes message Joshua and preach
[56:26] what Moses is preaching and take it
[56:29] right on in to the coming of the
[56:32] Lord so there was a capacity upon
[56:34] brother brenham's life it wasn't it
[56:36] wasn't that Moses wasn't good enough it
[56:38] wasn't that he wasn't good enough but as
[56:40] MOS his ministry had wed where it could
[56:43] only go to it was not his job to divide
[56:46] the inheritance but it was Joshua's
[56:49] commission to stand there and to divide
[56:52] that inheritance is that right that's
[56:55] just like brother random would say it
[56:56] like this he said Jesus's commission he
[56:59] said he brought them right up to the
[57:00] edge of it he took them right all the
[57:02] way up there to their possessions but he
[57:05] couldn't divide it to them he said but
[57:06] it was the Holy ghost's job to
[57:08] positionally place the church in its
[57:10] power to think about that that Jesus
[57:13] took us all the way he took his
[57:15] disciples they were with him all the way
[57:17] but the Holy Ghost came and set the
[57:19] church in order and when you go to get
[57:21] to reading Acts chapter 2 and you begin
[57:24] to read reading the book of Acts it's
[57:26] not the Acts of the Apostles it's the
[57:28] acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles
[57:32] and to think that that is how Jesus
[57:34] Christ set up his church that
[57:37] way he set up his church that way but
[57:39] the Holy Ghost was the one that was
[57:42] placing them in their in their natural
[57:45] or in their spiritual land just like not
[57:48] just like Joshua was placing the
[57:51] children of Israel in their natural land
[57:54] the Holy Spirit Spirit has been placing
[57:55] the church positionally in the land in
[57:58] their position that they belong in in
[58:01] their inheritance and when you know that
[58:03] you're in your message and when you know
[58:06] that you're in your position everything
[58:08] can line up but if something is off if
[58:12] something is blocking the Avenue you
[58:14] simply got to get it out of the
[58:16] way if there's sin in your life you can
[58:19] never go no
[58:20] further there's a story I I read it a
[58:23] few weeks ago about about there was
[58:26] there was this water Mainline breaking
[58:28] in college
[58:29] housing in college housing and they they
[58:32] had they they searched it all over and
[58:34] couldn't find the source of the problem
[58:36] and they they went in there and had
[58:37] plumbers come in and they couldn't find
[58:39] the source of the issue so they went in
[58:41] there plumbers they had all kinds of
[58:43] these commercial plumbers come in and
[58:44] try to go in there and they finally
[58:46] found the source of the problem it was a
[58:49] toad that had got in there and had
[58:51] blocked the main line but they said the
[58:54] only only way it could have ever got in
[58:56] there was it came in in the state of a
[58:59] tadpole but when it grew up it begin to
[59:03] block the lines and you might be able to
[59:05] handle the little foxes you might be
[59:08] able to handle the little bitty things
[59:10] but if you don't get it out of your life
[59:12] it'll come in as a tadpole and it'll
[59:14] block the
[59:16] lines but thank God we got some
[59:19] professional plumbers down here we got
[59:21] some fivefold Ministry down here that
[59:24] don't mind loosening up the pipes and
[59:27] letting the Holy Ghost water flow
[59:33] freely so Joshua placed them in their
[59:36] natural land but at the Holy Spirit our
[59:39] Joshua is placing the church in its
[59:43] spiritual position we are now seated in
[59:46] Heavenly places now when Jesus would
[59:49] come and he would say there in John
[59:51] chapter 14 and verse 12 he said verily
[59:54] verily I say unto you that he that
[59:56] believeth on me the works that I do
[59:59] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[1:00:02] these shall I do because I go unto my
[1:00:04] father and whatsoever you shall ask in
[1:00:06] my name that will I do that that the
[1:00:09] father might be glorified in the son if
[1:00:12] you shall ask anything in my
[1:00:14] name I will do it I know there's a lot
[1:00:17] of people that like to thinker try to
[1:00:19] put that off for days gone by that he
[1:00:21] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:00:22] so he do go also and Greater Works than
[1:00:25] he shall do and a lot of people try to
[1:00:27] put that on the prophet and said that
[1:00:29] was only for him but I happen to believe
[1:00:31] that I can read the Bible a little bit
[1:00:32] better than some of these intellectual
[1:00:34] so-called Giants because the Bible says
[1:00:36] right there he that believeth on me and
[1:00:39] I happen to believe that he wasn't just
[1:00:41] talking about one man but I happen to
[1:00:43] believe he was talking about
[1:00:45] you I believe that you can so position
[1:00:47] yourself as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:00:50] right here in the scripture that you can
[1:00:52] perfectly line yourself up yeah and you
[1:00:55] can watch the physical manifestation of
[1:00:57] the power of the Holy Ghost I thought
[1:00:59] you was talking about dividing
[1:01:00] inheritance that's exactly what I'm
[1:01:02] talking about these things are for
[1:01:05] you let me tell you what Joshua's job
[1:01:08] was to do was go out there and line out
[1:01:11] the borders and say this is exactly for
[1:01:14] you you can stay in these
[1:01:16] parameters little bride let me tell you
[1:01:18] that's what the message did it lined out
[1:01:21] the
[1:01:22] borders it lined out the borders because
[1:01:25] that's what we are under we're under a
[1:01:26] Joshua commission and that's what
[1:01:28] William Bram did when he go to studying
[1:01:30] out the Feast of the trumpet William
[1:01:32] brandham tried to go in there and he
[1:01:34] tried to preach the seven trumpets but
[1:01:37] remember that the angel the Lord stopped
[1:01:38] him and said it's not your job to preach
[1:01:41] them trumpets them trumpets are for
[1:01:43] Israel but he come through in the Feast
[1:01:45] of the
[1:01:46] trumpets and he started lying out the
[1:01:49] borders he started telling us that
[1:01:51] Ephesians parallels Joshua and he find
[1:01:54] out the borders for the Church of the
[1:01:56] Living God and I believe that it's if it
[1:01:59] if it's laying in the message then we've
[1:02:01] got every right brother Timothy to
[1:02:04] preach it with everything that's within
[1:02:07] us I believe it with everything that's
[1:02:09] within us that we ought to be able to
[1:02:11] preach what William Brandon preached and
[1:02:13] live this message to the fullness and
[1:02:17] its entirety and if we're going to do it
[1:02:19] it's got to be in sincerity and it's got
[1:02:22] to be in truth and when it's done that
[1:02:24] way it'll bring a power that'll squash
[1:02:29] Satan that's why Satan wants to keep you
[1:02:32] so filled up with carnality he wants to
[1:02:34] keep you so filled up with the things of
[1:02:36] the world that you can't be
[1:02:41] sincere but if he can if Jesus can get
[1:02:44] you under his control under sincerity
[1:02:47] and then watch the Power with character
[1:02:52] come well Glory
[1:02:55] power without character is
[1:02:57] satanic but character power with
[1:03:00] character is fit to
[1:03:03] rain that's why I'm not talking to a
[1:03:05] bunch of chickens I'm talking to Kingdom
[1:03:08] living people that's why William
[1:03:10] brandham could come and preach to you
[1:03:13] the future home of the Heavenly
[1:03:15] bridegroom and the Earthly bride it's
[1:03:17] because a character has matched on Earth
[1:03:20] what he is in
[1:03:23] heaven
[1:03:27] H I'm trying to be careful not let the
[1:03:29] preacher out too much cuz I know we got
[1:03:31] another service right after
[1:03:33] this but remember I'm I'm I'm just going
[1:03:36] to make some points and y'all going to
[1:03:38] have to use your own imaginations to let
[1:03:40] Revelation roll don't let your
[1:03:41] imagination roll but let Revelation roll
[1:03:44] and you're going to let you're going to
[1:03:45] have to let yourself take some take some
[1:03:47] roads that I would T typically take you
[1:03:49] on tonight but notice what he says in in
[1:03:52] the ephes or the revelation of Jesus
[1:03:54] Christ in the church age book he said
[1:03:56] remember this that
[1:03:59] Christ in the true church is a
[1:04:03] continuation of the book of Acts notice
[1:04:05] not in the false church not in a halfway
[1:04:07] church but the true church there's three
[1:04:10] kind of Believers in every church
[1:04:11] service
[1:04:13] real real unbelievers and makeb
[1:04:16] Believers and I tell you who I'm scared
[1:04:18] about it's to make Believers I ain't
[1:04:20] scared about them unbelievers and I
[1:04:22] definitely ain't scared about the real
[1:04:23] believers but it's in make Believers in
[1:04:26] Hypocrites that scare me but he notice
[1:04:28] what he says but Christ in the true
[1:04:31] church is a continuation of the book of
[1:04:35] Acts so let me say it like this I don't
[1:04:38] have I don't know any other way to say
[1:04:39] it like this if this church don't line
[1:04:42] up with what we read in the book of Acts
[1:04:45] then we need to go back to the drawing
[1:04:50] board because Christ in his true church
[1:04:54] church will be a continuation of the
[1:04:57] book of Acts he said but the Book of
[1:04:59] Revelation shows how the Antichrist
[1:05:01] Spirit notice the Antichrist spirit will
[1:05:03] come into church and defile it make it
[1:05:06] lukewarm formal and Powerless that's one
[1:05:08] thing I don't want to be I don't want to
[1:05:10] be lukewarm I don't want to be formal
[1:05:13] and I don't want to be powerless he said
[1:05:15] but it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:05:19] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:05:22] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:05:24] down to the time that he's cast into the
[1:05:26] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[1:05:29] stand it he knows that if the people get
[1:05:31] the true revelation of the true church
[1:05:33] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:05:36] that she can do the Greater Works that
[1:05:40] she will be an invincible Army so if the
[1:05:42] church gets a true revelation of who he
[1:05:46] is who Satan is in the framework of the
[1:05:49] church but catches a true revelation of
[1:05:52] who she is
[1:05:55] that she can do the same thing that
[1:05:57] Jesus did and
[1:06:02] greater I tell you what I'd do if I was
[1:06:04] a
[1:06:05] jebusite I'd do everything within my
[1:06:07] power to keep Joshua from preaching
[1:06:10] this come on somebody if I was a if I
[1:06:13] was an amot I'd do everything within my
[1:06:15] power to stop them from coming into my
[1:06:18] land ain't that right so what will Satan
[1:06:21] try to do he will try to tear down the
[1:06:23] power power of the word so he goes in
[1:06:26] there and try to put it off and delay it
[1:06:28] for some other
[1:06:30] day come on somebody so if I was if I
[1:06:34] was a jebusite I'd say now Joshua Don't
[1:06:37] You Preach that message Joshua don't
[1:06:39] teach them how to get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:41] Joshua don't teach them how to come in
[1:06:43] here and dispossess The Inheritance
[1:06:46] Joshua don't do
[1:06:49] [Music]
[1:06:50] it
[1:06:53] Hallelujah but he couldn't stop
[1:06:55] Joshua he couldn't stop him from going
[1:06:58] in there and preaching what the law had
[1:07:01] already
[1:07:03] said let me move
[1:07:05] on but you
[1:07:08] know man that's that's I want to let him
[1:07:11] out but I better hold on to
[1:07:13] him but
[1:07:16] Joshua Joshua
[1:07:18] signifies and means Jehovah savior that
[1:07:22] he shall save his people that's what
[1:07:25] Joshua is he is Jesus he shall save his
[1:07:29] people from their sins notice notice why
[1:07:34] would they ever got back there and never
[1:07:36] got to Waring and never got to worrying
[1:07:38] and fearing about things about where
[1:07:40] they were going to go and how they were
[1:07:41] going to get in there when you got a
[1:07:43] savior leading
[1:07:51] way come on now how why do you get so
[1:07:54] tore up about what's going on in Le osia
[1:07:57] why do you get so bombarded by what Fox
[1:07:59] news is saying and CNN is saying they
[1:08:02] ain't Our Savior but I got a savior
[1:08:05] that's leading me all the way I don't
[1:08:07] have to worry I don't have to fear I
[1:08:10] don't have to fret I don't care what the
[1:08:12] doctor says I got a savior that's
[1:08:14] leading me all the
[1:08:19] way Joshua's commission was to go in
[1:08:23] there and lay out the borders of the
[1:08:25] land it's exactly in line with the last
[1:08:28] day ministry under this anointing that
[1:08:30] here we are that the God that was is the
[1:08:33] god that is that's why I can have every
[1:08:36] right to stand here and say that what he
[1:08:38] did for sister Daryl ohania when she was
[1:08:42] back there and she was crippled up laid
[1:08:44] in that condition for 17
[1:08:47] years Mar said she was laid up in there
[1:08:50] crippled up like a spider draw up in
[1:08:52] there he said but I was led by a vision
[1:08:55] to go by her way he said when I walked
[1:08:58] by her way he said the angel of the Lord
[1:09:01] T tap me on the shoulder said recognize
[1:09:03] that door he walked in there and said is
[1:09:06] there a woman in here and there
[1:09:08] she was got the reading that our Menan
[1:09:10] Bible brother brandom asked her said are
[1:09:11] you a Believer she said I'm a
[1:09:15] Believer brother random said I simply
[1:09:17] just prayed a prayer over top of her he
[1:09:20] said and all of a sudden he said people
[1:09:22] thought that a funeral was place he said
[1:09:25] because there was so much noise down
[1:09:27] there he said people thought that Mrs
[1:09:28] darl ohania had actually
[1:09:31] died he said it absolutely was a funeral
[1:09:34] he said the old one had died and there
[1:09:36] was a new one
[1:09:38] born brother vham saw her down there on
[1:09:41] the street several years later when he
[1:09:43] was down there at the butcher shop
[1:09:44] getting some meat down there she came up
[1:09:46] to him said brother random you remember
[1:09:49] them people came to me and told me that
[1:09:51] I was just excited and I let the nerves
[1:09:53] down down in my legs she said well if
[1:09:55] that's the case I'm still excited
[1:09:58] today well you can blame it on
[1:10:01] excitement or not but I still believe
[1:10:03] that I the one that's destined for the
[1:10:06] Rapture call it excitement call it
[1:10:09] emotion but I happen to
[1:10:12] believe I know what I was like but I
[1:10:15] know what it's like to be
[1:10:19] free I ain't just excited I got the god
[1:10:23] of Joshua on my side this is my
[1:10:29] [Applause]
[1:10:34] land well maybe you ain't crippled but
[1:10:36] maybe you're bound by some homosexual
[1:10:39] Spirit but by the power of the Holy
[1:10:45] Ghost one
[1:10:47] [Applause]
[1:10:52] word blessed be the name of the
[1:10:57] Lord what Joshua do he went out there
[1:11:00] and laid out the borders for a new
[1:11:03] generation cuz in the Bible tells us
[1:11:05] that them old
[1:11:08] Fighters bunch of naysayers and old
[1:11:10] Fighters back there they wouldn't go on
[1:11:12] to their full
[1:11:14] possession and I tell you right now God
[1:11:16] ain't going to let no old fighters of
[1:11:18] the message go in in any other way but
[1:11:21] by the new birth
[1:11:24] come on somebody stop fighting about how
[1:11:26] hot it is in here stop fighting about
[1:11:28] how cold it is in here stop fighting
[1:11:31] well the lights just wasn't R and this
[1:11:33] wasn't just right we got a Rapture to
[1:11:36] take stop fighting about this one took
[1:11:39] my seat and that one took my seat let's
[1:11:41] go on the higher
[1:11:48] things Joshua knew Joshua knew that
[1:11:51] there was a new generation that was
[1:11:53] coming up
[1:11:55] up Joshua didn't have to worry about his
[1:11:57] commission it was given to him brother
[1:11:59] Steven all he had to do was stand out
[1:12:01] there and get under the anointing of
[1:12:06] it you ever been into a place where you
[1:12:09] didn't feel like worshiping God and all
[1:12:11] of a sudden the anointing came and
[1:12:12] inspiration begin to strike your heart
[1:12:14] and all of a sudden you steep right into
[1:12:16] it Joshua had to Simply step into the
[1:12:19] inspiration of Jehovah because when Josh
[1:12:23] what started laying out the borders he
[1:12:26] went out there and brother brandom said
[1:12:28] he caught inspiration about what them
[1:12:30] Hebrew mothers had said when they were
[1:12:32] giving birth to those tribes and when
[1:12:35] she would scream out Ephraim it was
[1:12:37] placing him by the sea or this one over
[1:12:40] here so they caught the inspiration in
[1:12:43] their birth
[1:12:45] pains it was placing the church and the
[1:12:48] church has went through birth pains
[1:12:50] she's went through Wars but it's
[1:12:52] positionally place
[1:12:55] tonight and Joshua simply he begin to
[1:12:59] catch that inspiration and he would
[1:13:00] place this one here and he would place
[1:13:02] that one there what was it he was simply
[1:13:05] lining out the portion that was luded to
[1:13:08] every tribe out there in Palestine but
[1:13:12] their name had a meaning and it showed
[1:13:15] up where they were built to be
[1:13:19] at let me tell you something the reason
[1:13:22] why the men andite or the the reason why
[1:13:24] the Methodist Church couldn't go no
[1:13:26] further why because brother bandam said
[1:13:29] they wouldn't stand still long
[1:13:31] enough to wash their spotted garments
[1:13:34] and that's a problem that too many times
[1:13:37] people around the message they don't
[1:13:38] stand still long enough to get
[1:13:40] themselves good and washed
[1:13:42] off let me tell you something you can
[1:13:45] never walk into the presence of God
[1:13:47] smelling like a
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:52] hog forgive me I know what y'all know
[1:13:55] what hogwash is but sometimes you need
[1:13:57] to get the hogwash off of you so that
[1:13:59] you can walk into the presence of God
[1:14:01] you said well I'm so busy I'm busy about
[1:14:03] this I'm busy about that that's what the
[1:14:05] Methodist Church said when William
[1:14:08] brandham saw her in a vision said I've
[1:14:10] been so busy I can't clean up my
[1:14:12] garments what are you so busy with that
[1:14:15] you can't spend time in the presence of
[1:14:17] the Lord and refresh yourself and wash
[1:14:20] yourself under the anointing of the Lord
[1:14:27] oh glory be to God they were placed by
[1:14:31] their name Abram could never bring forth
[1:14:35] an
[1:14:36] Isaac under the name of the high
[1:14:40] father so God had to change his name he
[1:14:43] had to change his name brother Thomas to
[1:14:46] Abraham to Abraham and what did he do
[1:14:49] when he changed his name from Abraham he
[1:14:52] changed him from high father mother to
[1:14:54] the father of many nations it ain't just
[1:14:57] what's laying in the name but it's what
[1:14:59] is in the name because he didn't just
[1:15:02] put an H in there he put a part of
[1:15:05] himself on the inside of there that's
[1:15:07] why Satan doesn't want you get into this
[1:15:10] message because this message will change
[1:15:13] your
[1:15:15] name will you say well you don't know
[1:15:17] what you're talking about brother Ang I
[1:15:19] absolutely do know what I'm talking
[1:15:20] about I might be a preacher and you
[1:15:22] might think I'm crazy but I know exactly
[1:15:25] what I'm talking about he didn't just
[1:15:27] change Abraham's name he changed Sarah's
[1:15:29] name to match it he put himself on the
[1:15:32] inside of
[1:15:35] her that's why William bam would say it
[1:15:37] like this I'll no longer call you church
[1:15:41] because you're not a part of the church
[1:15:43] you're a part of the
[1:15:45] bridegroom your name matches a
[1:15:47] reflection of
[1:15:49] [Applause]
[1:15:52] Heaven
[1:15:56] that's if we're ever going to move into
[1:15:58] it if we're ever going to walk into
[1:16:02] there we got to come under this
[1:16:06] message we got to d oury
[1:16:09] s but I believe that too many
[1:16:12] times that Satan tries to come in and he
[1:16:15] tries to put spiritual amnes in the
[1:16:17] Church of the Living God and make them
[1:16:18] forget who they
[1:16:21] are make them forget who they are they
[1:16:23] get shocked so much by the world they
[1:16:26] can't remember who their true identity
[1:16:29] is but if they can ever set still long
[1:16:32] enough maybe they can just climb over a
[1:16:34] hill maybe they can just go around the
[1:16:37] train quarters maybe they just slip
[1:16:39] around and maybe catch sight of home one
[1:16:44] time you ain't going to just see an old
[1:16:46] man sitting out there on some cabin
[1:16:48] porch you're going to see Popa God out
[1:16:50] there and he's going to be looking for
[1:16:52] you and he's going to have his arms wide
[1:16:54] open don't you try to worry is he going
[1:16:57] to receive me he's already been looking
[1:17:00] for
[1:17:02] you he's been looking for you he's been
[1:17:05] looking for you but it's time you shake
[1:17:08] yourself Shake Yourself and come start
[1:17:12] taking a walk down through the
[1:17:14] message You Walk This Way Before why
[1:17:17] can't you walk it
[1:17:22] again
[1:17:27] praise the
[1:17:29] Lord I
[1:17:33] noce praise the
[1:17:38] Lord let me go on here brother Rand
[1:17:42] takes on in that day on Calvary he said
[1:17:45] I notice he said the Greater Works was
[1:17:48] to have the power in the church not only
[1:17:51] to heal the Sick by prayer but to cast
[1:17:53] out Devils by prayer not not not only
[1:17:56] just to heal the Sick by prayer but cast
[1:17:58] Devils out by prayer he said but to
[1:18:00] impart eternal life to Believers he said
[1:18:03] the Holy Ghost was coming and given to
[1:18:05] the hands of the church to impart life
[1:18:07] he said that's what Calvary meant you
[1:18:10] think that tonight that when Jesus is
[1:18:12] standing there and he and he delivers
[1:18:15] John 14 and12 that he that believeth on
[1:18:17] me the works that I do shall he do also
[1:18:20] that he recognize that it wasn't just
[1:18:23] going to be in quantity and it wasn't
[1:18:25] going to be greater in quality but it
[1:18:27] was going to go beyond what even Jesus
[1:18:29] himself could
[1:18:32] do what is it he your ministry is going
[1:18:36] to go beyond Peter's Ministry Paul's
[1:18:39] Ministry was going to go beyond what
[1:18:41] Jesus's Ministry did in itself well
[1:18:44] that's pretty rough right there brother
[1:18:45] Andrew I'm bring I'm bringing right out
[1:18:47] the message
[1:18:48] tonight that notice that Greater Works
[1:18:51] than need shall he do
[1:18:53] because I go because I go now notice
[1:18:57] this that Jesus never could preach the
[1:19:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost because the
[1:19:02] Holy Ghost had not been yet given but
[1:19:04] when Jesus came and he sacrificed his
[1:19:07] own life I'm quoting you the prophet how
[1:19:10] when Jesus came and he sacrificed his
[1:19:12] own life he said that's how the Greater
[1:19:14] Works is done that by the imparting of
[1:19:18] Life do you recognize that right now
[1:19:21] under the preaching of the word that
[1:19:23] there is powerful words that are taking
[1:19:25] place moments that maybe you don't even
[1:19:28] understand but this is the Greater Works
[1:19:30] the imparting of life that the baptism
[1:19:33] of the Holy Ghost is the Greater
[1:19:37] Works it is the Greater Works don't you
[1:19:41] recognize
[1:19:43] tonight it ain't just got to be me it
[1:19:45] can be every one of you you can stand
[1:19:48] out there on the street and begin to
[1:19:50] impart life I ain't just talking about
[1:19:53] walking up some random preacher random
[1:19:54] stranger up there on the street and
[1:19:56] start saying I impart life to you I
[1:19:58] impart life to you I'll tell you you say
[1:20:01] well how How can any man do that brother
[1:20:03] brandom said a Son of God can do that a
[1:20:06] Son of God can do that and this is how
[1:20:08] you do it repent and be baptized in the
[1:20:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:20:14] remissions of your sins and you shall
[1:20:16] receive the gift of the Holy
[1:20:19] Ghost you say how in the world can a man
[1:20:21] do that that's how does it by the
[1:20:23] preaching of the word well I ain't no
[1:20:26] Preacher Brother Andrew but a prophet
[1:20:27] said that a Son of God can impart
[1:20:31] life did not Jesus said that whosoever
[1:20:34] sins you remit they remitted in
[1:20:37] heaven now the Catholic Church took that
[1:20:39] and it started saying well we've got the
[1:20:41] power we've got the power so we can roll
[1:20:43] your sins away but he Le the prophet
[1:20:46] came in and showed us what Jesus meant
[1:20:48] there that it was actually that it was
[1:20:51] perfectly in line with acts chap 2 and:
[1:20:55] 38 that
[1:20:58] that is the Greater Works you said well
[1:21:00] brother Andrew what are you talking
[1:21:01] about I'm talking about acts two I'm
[1:21:03] talking about acts two that when Peter
[1:21:06] got up there and he started preaching
[1:21:08] when he started preaching and the Holy
[1:21:09] Ghost begin to pour out up that day on
[1:21:12] the day of Pentecost there they come out
[1:21:14] there staggering and speaking in tongues
[1:21:16] they come out there on that day and then
[1:21:19] Peter started preaching a sermon
[1:21:23] he started preaching a sermon I believe
[1:21:25] that some of us preachers could take a
[1:21:27] take a real good sermon right here from
[1:21:28] Peter he preached the 15minute
[1:21:32] sermon a 15minute sermon and the Bible
[1:21:35] said in verse 41 2 and 41 that on that
[1:21:39] day that 3,000 Souls were added to the
[1:21:42] Church of the Living
[1:21:43] God what was what am I saying unto you
[1:21:46] I'm saying it's perfectly in line with
[1:21:48] acts 10 and44 that while Peter yet spake
[1:21:52] these words words the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:21:55] them now I want you to know I'm not
[1:21:58] Angel Gabriel tonight I'm not Angel
[1:22:00] Gabriel tonight and he ain't Angel
[1:22:01] Gabriel tonight but Angel Gabriel Angel
[1:22:05] Gabriel could not impart that word but
[1:22:07] it was a word from almighty God that
[1:22:10] deposited on the inside of
[1:22:12] Mary what was it that angel that picked
[1:22:15] up Phillip over there when he saw that
[1:22:17] there was a man over there reading the
[1:22:19] book of
[1:22:21] Isaiah took him over there the angel
[1:22:24] knew what the message was but it had to
[1:22:27] come through
[1:22:31] Humanity I'm going to clear something up
[1:22:34] real quick right here don't you
[1:22:35] understand why Satan is trying so hard
[1:22:37] to destroy the
[1:22:40] ministry don't you see why he's battling
[1:22:42] Tim puit and Ron Spencer and all these
[1:22:45] other brothers so hard it's because he
[1:22:47] recognizes that they've got more power
[1:22:50] than he's ever attained himself to
[1:22:54] that if they get the preaching under the
[1:22:56] inspiration of the word that imparting
[1:22:59] of Life can take
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:07] place it's a word that places you in
[1:23:09] your
[1:23:10] possession you
[1:23:12] recognize that all that inspiration LED
[1:23:14] them to the place that they were in you
[1:23:16] can go back and you can read Genesis
[1:23:18] chapter 49 and you can read the whole
[1:23:20] entire chapter and you can see that when
[1:23:22] when when Jacob is getting ready to come
[1:23:24] to the end of his life he's coming there
[1:23:26] to the end of his life and the Bible
[1:23:28] said in in the very last verse that
[1:23:30] Jacob pulled his feet up in the
[1:23:32] bed and he begin to give up the ghost
[1:23:35] but notice that he begin to line out the
[1:23:37] borders of where every one of them
[1:23:40] tribes and those and those prophets
[1:23:42] would be at in that land now brother
[1:23:44] bham said this he said I can perfectly
[1:23:46] take a map and I could line it over top
[1:23:49] of that scripture over in Genesis
[1:23:51] chapter 49 and he said I can tell you
[1:23:54] that all the way back there that Jacob
[1:23:57] prophesied where those children of
[1:23:59] Israel would be at in this day he said
[1:24:02] but they never got there until May the
[1:24:05] 7th of 1946 when an angel was up there
[1:24:09] meeting me and commissioning me to take
[1:24:11] this message to a gentile
[1:24:14] bride Hallelujah and to think that
[1:24:17] tonight the Church of the Living God is
[1:24:20] in place that the same angel
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:23] that the same angel that put the
[1:24:26] children of Israel back in their
[1:24:29] Homeland for 5,000 years it's been
[1:24:32] hanging there 5,000 years it's been
[1:24:35] hanging there but one
[1:24:40] night one night does it matter what one
[1:24:44] night

[1:24:55] church how about it we'll just take an
[1:24:57] intermission real quick y'all do this on

[1:25:24] to her

[1:29:00] over again and laying his hand on that
[1:29:03] post now that angel is here with that
[1:29:06] message I'm not giving over to
[1:29:08] imaginations or Illusions but I want you
[1:29:10] to know that same Angel is
[1:29:20] here I was preaching here on on New
[1:29:23] Year's Day only this only reason I'm
[1:29:25] telling you this is because brother Greg
[1:29:26] said it but brother Greg brother Greg
[1:29:29] sent me a note when I was in Belgium I
[1:29:31] about have myself a fit I was up there
[1:29:33] in that up up hotel room man about to
[1:29:37] got a heal Billy cutting shucking some
[1:29:39] corn right up
[1:29:41] here but he sent me this he said I don't
[1:29:43] know if you noce this or not he said but
[1:29:45] when you are preaching your message and
[1:29:46] brother brother Greg's got the clip
[1:29:48] he'll give it to you don't ask me for it
[1:29:49] he'll give it to you but he said while
[1:29:51] you preaching he said there was a there
[1:29:53] was a light that flashed over top of you
[1:29:55] he said and you started saying a shadow
[1:29:57] can't hurt you a shadow of a line can't
[1:29:59] hurt you a shadow of a sword can't hurt
[1:30:01] you he said and when you said that there
[1:30:03] was a light that flashed over top of you
[1:30:06] sister Gabrielle was sitting back there
[1:30:07] in the back and thinking did I really
[1:30:09] see that or
[1:30:11] not but when she heard that testimony it
[1:30:15] lined
[1:30:16] up now why I'm not trying to say
[1:30:18] anything to you but I'm simply trying to
[1:30:20] say this to you that that's Angel it's
[1:30:23] right here right now now if William
[1:30:26] brandham could take a map and lay it
[1:30:28] over top of them scriptures in Genesis
[1:30:30] 49 and it perfectly lines up if it
[1:30:34] perfectly lines up a 5,000 year old
[1:30:37] prophecy then how much more should the
[1:30:40] Church of the Living God if the true
[1:30:42] church of Mark 16 is the standard as is
[1:30:46] the pattern then we ought to be able to
[1:30:49] lay Acts chapter 2 Acts chapter 3 Mark
[1:30:53] chapter 16 lay it over top of this
[1:30:56] church and perfectly be in line with the
[1:31:00] message of the
[1:31:07] hour
[1:31:09] Hallelujah that same Angel is
[1:31:12] here I feel him in the room I know he's
[1:31:15] here by his word but I feel him in the
[1:31:17] room I know he's
[1:31:20] here

[1:31:26] behind this pull pit years year after
[1:31:28] year the Black Eagle he would stand here
[1:31:32] behind this pulpit and he would give his
[1:31:33] testimony he'd give his testimony about
[1:31:36] how that he'd went there in 1962 to the
[1:31:39] United States he went back in 1965 and

[1:34:56] the body of the Lord and I believe that
[1:34:58] you have the power to lay hands on the
[1:35:01] sick and they shall
[1:35:03] recover I believe that with all my heart
[1:35:06] if I didn't believe that then I would
[1:35:07] take you out I would take you out and

[1:39:19] man's hand how much more more as a son
[1:39:22] and daughter of God should you be able
[1:39:23] to go up before the Throne of God and
[1:39:25] say I see healing for this sister I see

[1:40:10] for Peter and we're not Jesus and we're
[1:40:14] not Paul but you're still Jesus Lord I
[1:40:17] pray the Jesus on the inside of the
[1:40:19] Church of the Living God would rise up
[1:40:22] on the inside of her somebody would
[1:40:24] Ascend their faith would Ascend into the

[1:40:29] call down manifestations of the Holy
[1:40:31] Ghost father I recognize Lord Jesus that
[1:40:35] there are those that are freshly back
[1:40:37] into the house of the Living God and
[1:40:39] they need an experience with you like
[1:40:41] never before but while hands are laid
[1:40:43] upon them I pray Lord Jesus if Peter's
[1:40:47] Shadow could walk over top of them and

[1:47:38] moment I'd like to say I'd like to thank
[1:47:41] all of our visitors for being here and I
[1:47:45] know this is probably not a custom that
[1:47:47] you're used to kind of what we're doing
[1:47:49] here just now but the but the Lord spoke
[1:47:51] to me this week to do it just like this
[1:47:54] and so I I want all of you to to partake
[1:47:58] with it if you would and amen all of our
[1:48:00] visitors he said well but I'm a
[1:48:02] visitor we're a family that's
[1:48:06] right amen if I can just catch your
[1:48:09] thoughts just for a
[1:48:11] moment communion is a very special time
[1:48:14] that's right amen thank you it was a
[1:48:18] special time in Jesus's Ministry
[1:48:22] [Music]
[1:48:24] hisory it would take place just before
[1:48:26] his
[1:48:28] crucifixion I'm sure there was no
[1:48:30] disciple that was aware of the coming
[1:48:32] events
[1:48:35] none amen none not even
[1:48:38] Judas amen was aware of the coming
[1:48:43] events you heard brother Andrew preach
[1:48:46] tonight I thought it was so special am
[1:48:49] Jesus would would tell the disciples now
[1:48:52] I want you to find a man with a picture
[1:48:54] of water and I want you to follow
[1:48:58] him and when you follow him he's going
[1:49:00] to go to a place and he's going to have
[1:49:02] a
[1:49:03] room amen and he'll give us that
[1:49:07] room and there we'll have her
[1:49:10] supper Last Supper because it's a moment
[1:49:13] to where that from this point Jesus will
[1:49:17] go to the
[1:49:19] garden
[1:49:21] and then he'll be
[1:49:23] arrested then he'll go on
[1:49:25] trial he'll never be quite in this
[1:49:28] assembly again quite like this in this
[1:49:30] natural order of his
[1:49:35] Humanity this is a place where a
[1:49:38] traitor is going to give him up he would
[1:49:42] be so
[1:49:44] disgusted until all the other disciples
[1:49:47] would say is it I right
[1:49:50] even John the Beloved would lay his head
[1:49:54] Lord is that
[1:49:56] I I don't want to betray
[1:49:59] you I don't want to betray you and
[1:50:02] finally Judas is
[1:50:06] manifested Jesus didn't condemn
[1:50:10] him
[1:50:12] amen he said what thou
[1:50:15] doest do
[1:50:17] [Music]
[1:50:19] quickly now this isn't the last
[1:50:22] communion he would tell us to do this as
[1:50:25] a ordinance of
[1:50:27] God all the way through the book of Acts
[1:50:30] and all the way to this day I think it's
[1:50:34] interesting that brother Brandon would
[1:50:36] come and his ministry was so
[1:50:39] orchestrated never take it for granted
[1:50:43] that he's going to preach incredible
[1:50:44] sermons in the last couple of years of
[1:50:46] his life after the seals cuz no longer
[1:50:49] is he he probing but he would tell us
[1:50:52] that you're not feeding on the mind of a
[1:50:53] man but you're feeding on the body word
[1:50:56] of the son of man he would preach
[1:50:58] sermons like future home things that are
[1:51:01] to be the token the
[1:51:03] Masterpiece Mighty God
[1:51:06] unveiled but as he would come he would
[1:51:08] speak
[1:51:09] leadership amen and in leadership it
[1:51:12] would be some of the most powerful
[1:51:14] thoughts that there would
[1:51:18] be then he would speak
[1:51:22] communion you can't orchestrate
[1:51:26] that and then his lips would be
[1:51:29] sealed on this
[1:51:32] side but it didn't stop the
[1:51:37] message Satan Satan didn't
[1:51:41] realize when he left God would raise up
[1:51:45] an
[1:51:46] army amen of believers
[1:51:50] all over the
[1:51:52] world that were not ashamed of this
[1:51:55] Supernatural message amen and it was
[1:51:59] more than just for a
[1:52:00] healing and it's more than just to make
[1:52:03] us a church no matter where we're at
[1:52:07] we're not here to build kingdoms we're
[1:52:09] here to prepare for the coming of the
[1:52:12] Lord we're here to walk in this building
[1:52:15] to feel his
[1:52:18] presence and in a moment become a better
[1:52:24] person maybe you walk in the first
[1:52:27] service and go I don't know much about
[1:52:28] this and maybe even after you leave the
[1:52:31] service I don't know if I ever go back
[1:52:33] again and then something inside of you
[1:52:34] goes I got to go back I don't know why
[1:52:37] but I got to go back and I got to go
[1:52:39] back and God ignites a thirst in your
[1:52:44] life a thirst in your life and maybe
[1:52:48] only in one sentence
[1:52:51] God tells you I'm with
[1:52:53] you and you know that no man knows that
[1:52:57] but God knows
[1:52:59] that now you see in the Millennium when
[1:53:02] we're all sitting in new
[1:53:05] bodies we're going to the marriage
[1:53:08] supper and we'll have communion
[1:53:11] again this is sacred to
[1:53:14] me to look at you and I know that some
[1:53:17] of you're going through some of the
[1:53:18] greatest strangs of your
[1:53:21] life some of the great greatest
[1:53:24] difficult
[1:53:27] moments but in just if we could put it
[1:53:29] in God's times in just in a few hours
[1:53:33] we'll s in a new
[1:53:37] body and all of life's journey
[1:53:42] over and everything will be
[1:53:46] fixed I like that he'll fix us
[1:53:50] in a moment and in a twinkle of an
[1:53:53] eye so no matter what your problems
[1:53:57] are as we take communion my mother was
[1:54:00] healed of a massive tumor in her
[1:54:04] breast and she just laid her hand on her
[1:54:07] breast while she was taking communion
[1:54:09] and God just took care of that thing and
[1:54:12] it
[1:54:13] dissolved I know of multitudes of
[1:54:17] Miracles that took place all communion
[1:54:20] was
[1:54:24] served I'd like to read this word of
[1:54:27] prayer that Jesus
[1:54:29] prayed in John chapter
[1:54:34] 17 he lifted up his eyes toward heaven
[1:54:37] and said
[1:54:38] father the hour is
[1:54:43] come I thought of these I thought of
[1:54:46] this very
[1:54:47] intently when God directed Ed me to read
[1:54:50] this at communion service because
[1:54:53] brother Tim
[1:54:55] spoke just if we could say in God's time
[1:54:57] just a few minutes ago on the hour is
[1:55:04] come glorify thy son that thy son may
[1:55:08] also glorify
[1:55:10] thee as thou has given him Power Over
[1:55:13] All Flesh that he should give eternal
[1:55:16] life to as many as has given
[1:55:20] him and this is life eternal that they
[1:55:23] might know the only true God Jesus
[1:55:28] Christ whom thou has
[1:55:30] sent I have glorified thee on the
[1:55:34] earth I have finished the work that thou
[1:55:37] gavest me to
[1:55:38] do and now oh Father glorify thou me
[1:55:42] with thine own self and with the glory
[1:55:45] which I have had with thee before the
[1:55:48] world was
[1:55:51] I have manifested thy
[1:55:53] name unto the men which thou gavest me
[1:55:56] out of the world thine they were and
[1:55:59] thou has given them me and they have
[1:56:02] kept Thy
[1:56:04] word now they have known that all things
[1:56:07] whatsoever thou Hast given me are of
[1:56:11] thee for I have given them The Words
[1:56:14] which thou gavest me and theyed them and
[1:56:19] they have
[1:56:20] surely that I came out of from thee and
[1:56:25] they believe that thou did send
[1:56:29] me I love these next words I pray for
[1:56:34] them I want you to say it right now
[1:56:37] Jesus prayed for
[1:56:42] me I pray not for the
[1:56:46] world but for them which thou gave us
[1:56:50] Hast given me for they are
[1:56:53] thine and all are mine are thine and
[1:56:58] thine are mine and I am
[1:57:01] glorified in
[1:57:04] them I'm glad that you can see Jesus in
[1:57:08] one
[1:57:09] another if you can look past the
[1:57:11] humanity and the false and the
[1:57:14] failures you see this is not our job
[1:57:17] today even as we come to communion to
[1:57:20] judge one
[1:57:21] another that's way higher than our pay
[1:57:24] grade that's
[1:57:27] right that's way higher than our pay
[1:57:30] grade but we're a team we're a
[1:57:34] body I'll just have to be honest with
[1:57:37] you I don't want to see my worst enemy
[1:57:39] go to
[1:57:40] [Music]
[1:57:43] hell can you Echo that thought where
[1:57:46] there's never another chance to come
[1:57:48] back that's right that's

[2:15:29] new maybe you've never done this before
[2:15:33] but let me just explain this to you this
[2:15:36] is unliving bread now it's a type of the
[2:15:40] body of Jesus
[2:15:44] Christ it has no yeast in it and and
[2:15:47] it's a type of no sin when God cleanses
[2:15:51] our lives and we're
[2:15:54] washed there's no sin recognized in our
[2:15:59] life can you imagine we have an accuser
[2:16:03] that has all kind of information but the
[2:16:05] blood of Jesus Christ
[2:16:08] amen said there's nothing can be held
[2:16:11] against
[2:16:14] them thank you Lord I ought to make us
[2:16:16] all shout right there
[2:16:19] yes this is
[2:16:21] wine it is a type of the blood of Jesus
[2:16:25] Christ now grape juice will rot amen
[2:16:30] it'll rot it will stink but wine will
[2:16:34] only get better with
[2:16:36] age amen and the longer you serve him
[2:16:40] Hallelujah the more that you'll fall in
[2:16:43] love with him for the greatness from day
[2:16:46] to day today
[2:16:49] today and we come together with these
[2:16:52] things in mind realizing that we're
[2:16:54] taking his
[2:16:56] life not the literal life it's a type of
[2:16:59] the life of Jesus Christ and we do this
[2:17:03] as an ordinance to
[2:17:04] God and every one of us have sinned and
[2:17:07] come short of the glory of God none of
[2:17:10] us can point our fingers at one another
[2:17:13] and we can only look to the cross of
[2:17:15] Jesus Christ and and say father forgive
[2:17:18] me I'm not talking about bank robbers
[2:17:20] and killing somebody I'm talking about
[2:17:22] just our attitude
[2:17:25] sometimes our thoughts sound Lou louder
[2:17:28] in heaven than our words do on Earth and
[2:17:31] so this is the point we come to a spot
[2:17:34] to where we say Lord Jesus for even the
[2:17:37] things that we don't even know anything
