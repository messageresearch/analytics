[28:22] marus
[28:44] I got to say uh I honestly
[28:48] was mixed emotions back there was almost
[28:52] praying brother Matt been calling
[28:54] me it's kind of funny reason I guess I
[28:59] I'm afraid of this song I've never tried
[29:01] to sing it except at home and it's a
[29:05] little different I tend to choose the
[29:06] easy ones does mean I sing them well but
[29:10] a brother special brother sent me this
[29:13] song A couple of months
[29:14] ago and it clicks so deeply in my heart
[29:18] and I think every one of you if you
[29:20] haven't heard it you'll say the same for
[29:22] yourselves it's it's not just Marcus's
[29:24] but it resonated so deep with the things
[29:28] that's happened over my life that I
[29:31] responded back to the brother and he
[29:33] said I knew it wouldn't fit for you he
[29:37] has a an awesome voice himself so I hope
[29:40] to hear him one day but I'm GNA borrow
[29:43] it today
[29:45] and I said I'm I'm fearful so if you're
[29:49] not sure just follow behind me a little
[29:51] bit and I do want to say it's never done
[29:55] this before but it's for you brother
[30:01] on when it was dark in my
[30:06] heart you brought life to me a child of
[30:13] Darkness became a child of
[30:19] life when my

[45:27] know that Satan's sure after him and in
[45:29] in every single way and so we just uh
[45:32] we're praying for him and believing that
[45:34] God's going to just touch him
[45:36] supernaturally today and Amen brother
[45:40] Ron's not just got a toothache going on
[45:42] and and uh oh he's he's battling a lot
[45:45] of things but we know that the the
[45:47] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[45:50] so we we commit our we commit our heart
[45:52] to praying for our pastor also want to
[45:54] make mention um in weeks from uh this
[45:59] weekend on March the 15th and March 16th
[46:01] we were having our brother Tom Ray and
[46:04] brother Michael Ray um here again this
[46:07] year and so we want you to come with
[46:10] your hearts full and uh you all know
[46:12] that these brothers have a very special
[46:14] spot in our heart and and brother Tom
[46:17] was the one that led me to the Lord
[46:18] there and so he holds a very special
[46:21] spot in our hearts but I want you
[46:23] to I just I just say it like this I want
[46:26] you to package this place
[46:28] out I want you to invite your friends I
[46:31] want you to invite your your loved ones
[46:33] I want you to even invite those that you
[46:36] don't even think would receive it but
[46:37] invite them and uh just come here
[46:40] expecting I believe that these brothers
[46:43] they were so mightily used to the Lord
[46:45] last year we invited them to come and
[46:47] they're more than just friends to us
[46:49] they are they're men of this message and
[46:52] we just want to uh just open our our
[46:56] hearts door for the word of the Lord
[46:58] that is coming and we're just
[47:00] anticipating great things I believe that
[47:02] we're in a very uh special time that we
[47:05] are in right now and I I believe that
[47:07] God has very very specific things in
[47:10] this hour and I believe that the word of
[47:13] the Lord you can see it and I I know
[47:15] that there's a lot of things that you'll
[47:16] see on stream that sometimes take away
[47:18] from the
[47:19] inspiration and you'll see this brother
[47:21] preaching and you'll see this brother
[47:23] preaching and you'll think well they
[47:24] they've been kind of conjoining thoughts
[47:26] together they've been talking
[47:27] absolutely not I mean we're we're very
[47:30] close friends but we don't do those
[47:31] things but it's the spirit of God that
[47:32] is speaking in this last age and I
[47:35] believe that that YouTube and this
[47:37] internet sometimes it takes away from
[47:39] the realities that Christ is is speaking
[47:41] in in this part of the world and he's
[47:43] speaking in that part of the world and
[47:44] it's the same
[47:45] voice amen amen so I just believe that
[47:49] we're in a very special time amen how
[47:51] many has a need today that you'd like to
[47:53] make known to the Lord by the way of an
[47:56] uplifted hand amen it's good to see each
[47:59] and every one of you today amen let's
[48:01] just go to the Lord in prayer maybe
[48:03] maybe we just join our faith together
[48:05] and lay hands on one another and uh and
[48:10] just believing that all things are
[48:12] possible I just want to ask for special
[48:14] prayer for our pastor today that God
[48:16] would touch him in in a very special way
[48:19] father we come to you today Lord we're
[48:21] your children Lord and we we just want
[48:24] to bless your Holy Name today we want to
[48:27] say God there is no one like you Lord

[48:32] we are in lord it's it's it's a it's a
[48:34] presence that we're so thankful and
[48:36] humbled to be in Lord Jesus to to
[48:39] realize that it's it's not just by meere
[48:42] chance and opportunity that we have been
[48:45] a lotted this space and time to be able
[48:47] to stand here Lord I believe that you
[48:50] set these things up for us as your
[48:51] children you predestined us to stand in
[48:53] this hour Lord when we realize that the
[48:56] the enemy is is roaring and trying to to
[49:00] stop your voice from going forth today
[49:03] we ask Lord that you would speak Lord
[49:05] Jesus and let the lion roar oh God and
[49:07] you would you would let the lion of the
[49:09] tribe of Judah just roar in our hearts
[49:11] Revelations father that will thwart the
[49:14] very enemy in in our lives today Lord
[49:17] and you would just come here today I
[49:19] know that there are many that are sick
[49:20] and there's many needs that are amongst
[49:22] us here in our local assembly and we're
[49:25] asking father that you would move Lord
[49:27] Jesus and move through the congregation
[49:29] we realize Lord that that light is
[49:31] transferred from one another Lord that
[49:33] they're there is a gathering of people
[49:36] that is here and it is your Pillar of
[49:38] Fire that has drawn us here Lord and

[49:43] sisters have have joined their fath
[49:45] together today Lord in one Accord I pray
[49:48] that there would be such a unity in our

[49:52] healing to our bodies that we would
[49:54] rightly discern that this is the body of
[49:56] Christ Christ that you are speaking
[49:57] through and today that they that we
[50:00] would literally not be able to have an
[50:02] infirmity amongst our midst Lord I know
[50:05] that as long as we're here we're going
[50:06] to deal with these things but I believe
[50:08] that we can have Divine Health along

[50:12] and spiritual healing as well and we
[50:15] just invite you to be Lord today Lord

[50:19] our faith together and ask God a special
[50:22] touch to him today Lord according to Thy
[50:24] word we believe these things and we pray
[50:27] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and
[50:30] amen if you have your Bibles today we'd
[50:33] like to look again in the Book of Psalms
[50:35] chapter 23 and also to Revelations chap
[50:43] 12 amen
[50:56] start at verse four today
[51:04] here I'd like to just read reread this
[51:08] quote to you where we're drawing this
[51:12] this context for mother Bram said in the
[51:15] beginning and the ending of the Gentile
[51:16] dispensation he said no wonder David
[51:18] said the Lord is my shepherd and I shall
[51:19] not want how he leads us by The Still
[51:23] Waters and restores their soul and runs
[51:25] our cups over
[51:27] and anoints us in the presence of the
[51:28] enemy he said did you ever get anointed
[51:30] in the presence of your enemy just to
[51:32] testify to your cup just bow over you
[51:35] know just how marvelous it is to be
[51:37] anointed when in the presence of your
[51:40] enemy verse four here in Psalms chapter
[51:42] 23 says yay though I walk through the
[51:45] valley of the shadow of death I will
[51:48] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[51:51] rod and thy staff they comfort me thou
[51:54] preparest a table before me in the
[51:56] presence of my enemies and thou
[51:58] anointest my head with oil and my cup
[52:01] runneth over surely goodness and mercy
[52:03] shall follow me all the days of my life
[52:06] and I will dwell in the house of the
[52:08] Lord forever amen Revelations chap 12
[52:12] and verse 7
[52:33] amen and there was war in heaven Michael
[52:37] and his angels fought against the dragon
[52:40] and the dragon fought and his angels and
[52:43] Prevail not and neither was their place
[52:45] found anymore in heaven and the Great
[52:48] Dragon was cast out that old serpent
[52:51] called the devil and Satan which
[52:53] deceiveth the whole world now hold on to
[52:56] that word deceiveth he deceiveth the
[52:58] whole world and he was cast out into the
[53:01] Earth and his angels were cast out with
[53:03] him and I heard a loud voice saying in
[53:06] heaven now is come salvation and
[53:08] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[53:11] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[53:15] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[53:17] down which accuse them before our God
[53:21] day and night and they overcame him by
[53:23] the blood of the lamb and by the word of
[53:25] their test Tony and they love not their
[53:28] lives unto the death therefore Rejoice
[53:31] ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe
[53:34] to the inhabiters of the earth and of
[53:36] the sea for the Devil is come down unto
[53:39] you having great wrath because he
[53:41] knoweth that he hath but a short time
[53:45] may God bless his word you may be seated
[53:47] here today in the presence of the Lord
[53:49] again we'd like to speak to you on this
[53:52] this text anointed in the presence of
[53:55] the enemy mother Bron would say it like
[53:58] this he said in the midst of everything
[54:00] God will cause his enemies to testify to
[54:04] his glory in the midst of everything God
[54:06] will cause his enemies to testify of his
[54:10] glory and I believe that that's the hour
[54:12] that we are truly living in that the
[54:14] enemy is literally testifying of how
[54:16] great that the holy ghost that you have
[54:18] on the inside of you truly is and I I
[54:21] believe that that when you come and you
[54:23] refuse to give in to Satan's lies it
[54:26] again proves that thou art anointed and
[54:30] brother Brandon would say in the
[54:31] greatest battle ever fought he said now
[54:32] he said this great first battle that was
[54:35] ever fought began in heaven when Michael
[54:37] and his angels fought against Lucifer
[54:39] and his angels He said it first started
[54:42] and the first battle was in heaven he
[54:44] said so sin did not originate on Earth
[54:46] but it originated in heaven and then it
[54:48] was thrown down from heaven and cast out
[54:50] of Heaven to the Earth and fell on human
[54:52] beings so we realize that the the war
[54:56] started in heaven said that sin did not
[54:58] just originate that you see it here in
[55:01] the Garden of Eden but e that sin was
[55:04] found in Lucifer's heart and then it was
[55:07] then that that battle was thrown down
[55:09] and cast out of Heaven to the Earth and
[55:11] it fell on human beings he said then the
[55:13] battle from Angels became human battles
[55:16] and Satan come to destroy God's creation
[55:18] what God had had created to be hisself
[55:22] he had Satan come to destroy this Satan
[55:25] come to destroy this that which God had
[55:28] created for himself Satan come to
[55:31] destroy that he said that's what his
[55:33] purpose was to destroy it so God has a
[55:37] purpose and Satan has a purpose that we
[55:40] realize that then the battle began here
[55:41] on Earth and it began in us and it's
[55:44] been raging ever since and we realize
[55:46] that you go back all the way to the
[55:48] Garden of Eden and you see that battle
[55:50] that was there that you see the battle
[55:52] that was there between it the whole
[55:54] battle is based upon the word of God you
[55:56] you might feel like sometimes that it's
[55:58] very personal to you the battles that
[56:01] you are in and the attacks that you are
[56:02] in the reason why you are attacked so
[56:05] much if you begin to read in Matthew
[56:07] Chapter 13 about the one that went out
[56:09] and sold good seed and then there come
[56:11] one behind him that sold Bad Seed in
[56:13] there you see the attack isn't against
[56:15] you the attack is against the one that
[56:17] owns the field and our Lord Jesus Christ
[56:20] owns you and he is going to protect you
[56:22] so don't feel like just because you're
[56:24] going through the battle or just because
[56:26] you're going through Le osia and you got
[56:28] troubles God God's not just singling you
[56:30] out Satan is after every one of us he is
[56:34] after every single one of us and you see
[56:36] when God begin to establish his Eden you
[56:39] see when God established it he
[56:41] established it upon righteousness but
[56:43] you look at Satan's Eden you'll see that
[56:46] it was established in unbelief it was
[56:48] established in sin and we realize that
[56:50] where we are right now is we are in
[56:53] Satan's Eden but we realize that when
[56:55] brother B is is standing there and he
[56:57] preaches in
[56:58] 1965 he said I want to bring to you
[57:00] something that will keep the punches off
[57:03] of you so we realize that the message
[57:05] that you and I have been given in this
[57:06] hour is a message that will keep the
[57:09] punches off of us as much as possible
[57:11] and I believe that if we're going to
[57:13] overcome Le oosa if we're going to
[57:15] overcome Satan's Eden then there's only
[57:17] thing that we can PR there's only one
[57:19] thing that we can prepare oursel in this
[57:21] battle of strength Thor and it's the
[57:23] message of the hour
[57:26] amen now now brother random would say
[57:29] when you when you begin to look in the
[57:30] Ephesian Church age he said now he said
[57:32] we start with the fact that there was
[57:35] two trees in the midst of the garden he
[57:37] said the tree of life was Jesus he said
[57:39] the other is definitely Satan because of
[57:42] what came forth of the fruit of that
[57:44] tree he said now then we know that both
[57:46] of those trees had a relationship to man
[57:49] or they would have never been place
[57:50] there they must have had a part in The
[57:52] Sovereign plan and purpose of God in
[57:55] their relationship to mankind andto
[57:57] himself or we can never impute
[57:59] omniscience unto God this is all true so
[58:02] far is it not he said now the word most
[58:05] definitely sets forth that from before
[58:07] the foundation of the Earth the purpose
[58:09] of God was to share his eternal life
[58:12] with man so we realize that this is a
[58:15] part of of of God's three-fold purpose
[58:18] that he would he wanted to reveal
[58:20] himself to the people that's a part of
[58:22] it and we look all the way back in the
[58:24] Garden of Eden this was not a surprise
[58:27] to God but there were two trees there
[58:29] was two persons that was there in the
[58:31] Garden of Eden and one was the tree of
[58:34] life and one was the tree of knowledge
[58:36] which we realize that that was Satan
[58:38] himself the person in that tree but we
[58:41] realize that when God put man here he
[58:43] placed him upon free moral agency to
[58:46] choose for himself to to choose and to
[58:49] create and to to move things here and
[58:51] there and when Eve had made her choice
[58:54] because being placed here on free moral
[58:57] ageny she made the wrong choice and
[58:59] chose the wrong tree instead of the
[59:01] right tree now Paul said in Ephesians 1
[59:04] and4 according as he hath chosen Us in
[59:07] him before the foundation of the world
[59:09] somebody say before the foundation of
[59:11] the
[59:12] world he chose us in him before the
[59:15] foundation of the world that we should
[59:17] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[59:20] love and I'm going to skip all the way
[59:21] down to verse 11 he said in whom also we
[59:24] have obtained an inheritance obtained
[59:28] and inheritance being predestinated
[59:30] according to the purpose of him who
[59:33] worketh all things after the counsel of
[59:36] his own will so there is nothing that is
[59:38] happening that God has not already seen
[59:40] we can say Amen to that I believe that
[59:43] even right here that all almighty God
[59:45] saw before before the world was ever
[59:47] spoken to existence he saw the battles
[59:50] and the attack of the enemy that we are
[59:52] going to go through and we realize that
[59:54] God has predetermined our being here he
[59:58] has predetermined our being here and I I
[1:00:00] would just like to say this as we get
[1:00:02] ready to go into these things that God
[1:00:04] did not predetermine us here to let us
[1:00:07] be lost and to let us lose this battle
[1:00:10] but God predetermined us because he saw
[1:00:13] us winning the battle that is here in
[1:00:14] front of
[1:00:16] us I say blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:19] I want to say that God predetermined
[1:00:23] Eve and God knew that Eve was going to
[1:00:26] make the wrong choice and God knew what
[1:00:29] kind of choice that you was going to
[1:00:31] make but God did not choose you because
[1:00:33] of the choice that you were going to
[1:00:35] make God chose you before you can make
[1:00:38] the right choice or the wrong choice
[1:00:41] before you may chose him to serve him
[1:00:43] all the days of your life before you can
[1:00:45] make that right kind of a choice God
[1:00:47] elected you God for ordained you you
[1:00:50] might have grew up in a drunkard's home
[1:00:52] you might have grew up in a family that
[1:00:54] didn't know God but before before your
[1:00:56] parents ever made the right decision or
[1:00:58] the wrong decision almighty God elected
[1:01:01] You by for ordination to choose you to
[1:01:04] stand in this evil
[1:01:06] age
[1:01:08] Hallelujah I say that God predetermined
[1:01:11] Eve is that right he predetermined Eve
[1:01:15] but he was not willing that she would be
[1:01:17] without Fellowship so he created himself
[1:01:19] he created them a a place where they
[1:01:21] could walk back into Fellowship
[1:01:24] again but when when God starts walking
[1:01:27] down through the Garden of Eden after
[1:01:28] man falls it's amazing how Humanity
[1:01:31] likes to play the blame game of where
[1:01:33] the attack comes
[1:01:34] from when it's really your fault you
[1:01:37] start blaming everybody else I mean it's
[1:01:40] it's an amazing thing when you start
[1:01:42] blaming everybody else and you're the
[1:01:43] one that created the message you got
[1:01:45] yourself in I say sometimes you just
[1:01:47] need to own up and fess up to the fact
[1:01:49] I'm the one that messed up God but when
[1:01:52] God started walking with her brother
[1:01:53] Doug he started talking to her and she
[1:01:56] said it was that serpent it was that
[1:01:57] tree that you put here that came in here
[1:02:00] and beguiled
[1:02:02] me now when you look at that word begal
[1:02:05] it means to seduce it means to deceive
[1:02:09] notice when he was cast down out of
[1:02:11] Heaven he came here to deceive this
[1:02:14] world that serpent that you created
[1:02:18] God them troubles that you created them
[1:02:21] tempt no no no no no no no this is on
[1:02:24] you but God didn't not leave you here so
[1:02:27] that you could just go through the
[1:02:28] seduction of the devil and go through
[1:02:30] the deceiving he give you a way out of
[1:02:34] it now Paul said in his first letter to
[1:02:37] Timothy chapter 4 and one he said now
[1:02:39] the spirit speaks expressedly that in
[1:02:41] latter times shall some depart notice
[1:02:45] some shall depart from the faith giving
[1:02:48] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[1:02:51] of devils so the spirit speaks in this
[1:02:55] generation expressing me that there's
[1:02:58] going to be some that will depart from
[1:02:59] the faith now you know that Jude that
[1:03:02] the book of Jude says that that that you
[1:03:05] ought to contend for the faith there
[1:03:07] ain't but one faith is that right
[1:03:09] there's only one Faith there's a lot of
[1:03:10] religions but there's only one faith and
[1:03:13] this powerful spirit that has come in
[1:03:15] this way in this age has come here not
[1:03:18] to deceive you to to make you not to
[1:03:20] make you just just to be a bad a good
[1:03:23] person or a bad person but it's come
[1:03:25] here to deceive you from the
[1:03:29] faith and would get heed give heed to
[1:03:32] seducing he said you know what sedu is
[1:03:35] he said a seducing spirit in the church
[1:03:38] he said that is
[1:03:43] clergy it's a seducing clergy Spirit
[1:03:46] workings of devils of hypocrisies in the
[1:03:49] church so you notice back when it
[1:03:52] started after after the Ephesian Church
[1:03:55] a and you watch if that seducing Spirit
[1:03:58] comes in there they had a perfect Faith
[1:04:01] but you watch that seducing Spirit come
[1:04:03] in there and it starts manipulating
[1:04:05] through the clergy and there all of a
[1:04:07] sudden all of these things come together
[1:04:10] you watch the most predominant spirit
[1:04:12] that you face today it is not tobacco it
[1:04:15] is not drinking but the most seducing
[1:04:18] spirit that you will face is a spirit of
[1:04:21] religion it's a spirit of tradition I
[1:04:24] can stand to you and and I can I can
[1:04:26] witness the fact that that that there is
[1:04:28] that I say this that there's no there's
[1:04:30] no spirit that cannot be broke by the
[1:04:33] name of Jesus Christ but the hardest one
[1:04:35] to break is a religious spirit it's
[1:04:38] somebody that thinks they're okay and
[1:04:40] they believe they're okay under their
[1:04:42] denominational ideas of ideologies but
[1:04:45] there is a power in this age to that you
[1:04:47] are anointed with to conquer every
[1:04:50] Spirit to conquer every denominational
[1:04:53] spirit it's a seducing spirit that makes
[1:04:56] it where God that makes Satan look like
[1:05:00] God Almighty and he's Hallelujah and you
[1:05:03] think you're worshiping God but you're
[1:05:05] making love with the devil now that's a
[1:05:08] powerful Spirit to make you think you're
[1:05:11] doing the right thing and in turn you're
[1:05:14] worshiping
[1:05:17] Satan but I love what the scripture said
[1:05:19] to every single one of the ages he that
[1:05:22] has an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:05:25] is saying under the churches yes there's
[1:05:27] an antichrist spirit that is speaking
[1:05:29] but there's a voice that is still in
[1:05:31] this generation that is speaking louer
[1:05:33] than seducing spirits that is greater
[1:05:36] than deceiving Spirits there is a power
[1:05:39] that has produced powerhouses to not be
[1:05:42] deceived by the LIE of the
[1:05:45] devil we realize in this generation that
[1:05:48] we are
[1:05:49] facing more demons than any other age we
[1:05:53] realize that when the seals released
[1:05:55] that those demons that come out out of
[1:05:57] the river of Euphrates that you'll see
[1:05:59] there in the Book of Revelations these
[1:06:01] are Supernatural Chargers Supernatural
[1:06:04] devils and the Bible said in Revelations
[1:06:07] 9 and 19 that their power is in their
[1:06:11] mouth and in their tals now the prophet
[1:06:14] taught us it's in the tale that they're
[1:06:17] telling you don't think you don't think
[1:06:19] it's powerful you just let them start
[1:06:21] quoting Matthew 288 and
[1:06:23] 19 you don't think it's powerful they
[1:06:26] have built a cont an entire religious
[1:06:29] system on the words of Jesus that were
[1:06:31] taken out of context without Revelation
[1:06:34] and it has seduced the whole world and
[1:06:36] the Catholicism ideology has built it up
[1:06:39] in such a way that to make people think
[1:06:42] that they have the rule in the word of
[1:06:44] God that they speak instead of the word
[1:06:45] of God but the spirit of God in this
[1:06:48] generation has come to curse that Spirit
[1:06:51] to break that spirit I say that the
[1:06:53] message of the hour break the strongest
[1:06:56] hold that Satan can ever offer to you
[1:06:59] this message breaks the spirit of
[1:07:04] Catholicism well you say Well it don't
[1:07:06] it don't bother me I can I can worship
[1:07:08] like everybody else let me say this let
[1:07:10] me say this they are connected by the
[1:07:13] umbilical cord of baptism in Trinity of
[1:07:16] titles and you think well they're
[1:07:18] Baptist and they're good people it ain't
[1:07:20] them people what's up brother Andrew who
[1:07:22] are you after this morning I ain't after
[1:07:23] any of them people but I am after that
[1:07:26] devil that makes people think that just
[1:07:28] because they're good people and just
[1:07:30] because they love Jesus and just because
[1:07:32] they sing good songs and just because
[1:07:34] they worship makes them a Christian I'll
[1:07:36] say this there is a spirit that has
[1:07:38] spoken this generation to curse that Li
[1:07:41] of the devil I say this you can't
[1:07:44] worship God in spirit and truth and be
[1:07:46] in a false religion false religion will
[1:07:49] create false spirits and false spirits
[1:07:52] will create a false identity in you
[1:07:56] you wonder why they're sin amongst their
[1:07:57] preachers they're sin amongst their
[1:07:59] pastors they're sin in the clergy it's
[1:08:01] because they are they are worshiping God
[1:08:04] through vain ideology and they don't
[1:08:06] know the god that they're talking
[1:08:08] about now he's good people in
[1:08:10] there but it's a spirit behind
[1:08:14] it you see what these demons in this
[1:08:17] last age are designed to attack those
[1:08:21] that are willing to press into God's
[1:08:23] word they are lit spirits that have come
[1:08:27] through a Roman Empire spirit that has
[1:08:29] revived itself in ideologies of of
[1:08:32] system ideas that has constantly
[1:08:34] Brainwashed the masses of the people to
[1:08:37] make people think they're in the right
[1:08:39] but I love the scripture in Revelations
[1:08:42] 18 it said come out of her my people
[1:08:44] that you be not partaker of her sins
[1:08:47] that you receive not of her plagues so
[1:08:49] you can see why that Antichrist Spirit
[1:08:52] hates the power of the true spirit
[1:08:55] because every single time that power
[1:08:57] exposes that Antichrist it exposes him
[1:09:01] and his Future Works is that
[1:09:05] right now watch what brother random says
[1:09:07] in Le utsy and church age he said now
[1:09:09] why did these false prophets come
[1:09:11] against the true prophet and discredit
[1:09:13] his teaching he said it's because they
[1:09:16] are running true to form as did their
[1:09:18] forefathers when in the days of Ahab and
[1:09:21] they withstood Micaiah so the Same
[1:09:23] Spirit that's in this age Was the Same
[1:09:26] Spirit that was back in ahab's day and
[1:09:28] that same Spirit That Came Upon Ahab and
[1:09:31] in that age was the Same Spirit that was
[1:09:33] all the way back there in the Garden of
[1:09:35] Eden that did not come from Adam and it
[1:09:38] did not come from Abel but it came from
[1:09:40] the wicked one you carry the nature of
[1:09:43] your
[1:09:47] parents so what was in
[1:09:51] God that would make Cain kill a
[1:09:56] it could not have been his
[1:10:00] seat but what was in the seat of Jesus
[1:10:04] that he could turn to them Wicked ones
[1:10:06] and said I forgive you it shows the
[1:10:10] power of the battle of the seeds that
[1:10:12] was back there in the Garden of Eden
[1:10:14] that was right there in the age when
[1:10:16] Christ was here and it shows the ability
[1:10:18] of that seed even right
[1:10:21] now they were 400 of them all of them
[1:10:24] were in agreement by them all saying the
[1:10:27] same thing they fold the people but one
[1:10:31] Prophet just one was right and all the
[1:10:34] rest of them wrong because God had
[1:10:37] committed the Revelation to only one
[1:10:40] beware of false prophets for they are
[1:10:43] ravening
[1:10:46] wolves now the spirit is speaking
[1:10:49] expressly in this
[1:10:52] generation to watch them things to watch
[1:10:55] them think you think well I I I you know
[1:10:57] I'm I'm covered by the message and I'm
[1:10:59] not going to have to go through these
[1:11:01] things absolutely contrary you're going
[1:11:03] to face these things as long as you're
[1:11:06] here when Jesus himself was standing
[1:11:09] there he knew he was born for a purpose
[1:11:12] and when he come to the fullness of his
[1:11:13] ministry at 30 years old he's standing
[1:11:17] there and he realizes that he's Anointed
[1:11:20] with a purpose to stand against the
[1:11:23] crowd he's anointed for it he's elected
[1:11:27] to stand there and when Jesus goes in
[1:11:29] Luke chapter 4 and he goes back to his
[1:11:33] hometown they couldn't handle the
[1:11:35] anointing that was on him they could not
[1:11:38] handle the anointing that was on him
[1:11:39] brother Jonathan neither can this world
[1:11:41] handle the anointing that is on
[1:11:43] you and Jesus stood there when the book
[1:11:46] of Isaiah was was handed unto him and he
[1:11:50] read to them out of Isaiah 61 arise and
[1:11:53] shine for that now the anointed one is
[1:11:56] speaking unto you he's anointed me to
[1:11:58] preach he's anointed me to do these
[1:12:01] things and you watch what happened they
[1:12:04] could not handle that he was calling
[1:12:05] himself
[1:12:07] deity they could now I'll tell you what
[1:12:09] they enjoyed his
[1:12:10] miracles you watch The Same Spirit today
[1:12:13] they W they enjoyed the first pole they
[1:12:15] enjoyed the second pole but when it come
[1:12:17] to the revealing of the opening of the
[1:12:19] word they could not handle the anointing
[1:12:21] that was there they could not handle the
[1:12:23] power that was behind that saying that
[1:12:25] his him that was too much that was too
[1:12:27] much to say that I am my father are one
[1:12:30] that was too much and he come there in
[1:12:32] his own Hometown and the Bible said that
[1:12:34] all day in the synagogue when they heard
[1:12:36] these things they were filled with
[1:12:40] wrath this was not a holy anger this was
[1:12:43] a demonic
[1:12:46] wrath notice what they did they took him
[1:12:48] out on the cliff and they wanted to cast
[1:12:50] him down but because it was not his time
[1:12:53] the spirit of God would not allow to
[1:12:55] cast him off I want to say this to you
[1:12:57] Satan has come against you with every
[1:12:59] sickness and every Power and every
[1:13:01] disease but he cannot touch you he
[1:13:03] cannot take your life he cannot destroy
[1:13:06] you because it is not your time yet it
[1:13:08] is your time right now to arise and
[1:13:12] shine glory be to God Thou Art anointed
[1:13:16] in this age there's birth things that
[1:13:18] are going on but I say this day this
[1:13:20] scripture is fulfilled
[1:13:28] whoa glory be to
[1:13:29] God they couldn't hear that
[1:13:32] voice they couldn't understand that
[1:13:36] voice maybe try cutting the monitors
[1:13:39] down here but not this maybe that's
[1:13:41] what's causing it
[1:13:44] Brothers they couldn't handle that voice
[1:13:46] but that voice that was speaking brother
[1:13:48] Chris had so much power that Jesus could
[1:13:51] say my sheep know my voice and a
[1:13:54] strength or they will not follow it
[1:13:56] might look deceptive to this one might
[1:13:58] look deceptive to that one but my sheep
[1:14:01] know my voice they're not going to
[1:14:03] follow this ideology they're not going
[1:14:05] to follow this here or there even though
[1:14:07] it looks right they know my voice they
[1:14:09] know what I've said
[1:14:12] they you may have never heard it before
[1:14:15] but just because you never heard it does
[1:14:17] not mean that you can't have
[1:14:19] it God knows where to find you
[1:14:23] at it doesn't matter how long you've
[1:14:25] been in the message and how long how
[1:14:27] short you've been in the message God
[1:14:29] knows who you are and his voice will
[1:14:31] wake up that
[1:14:36] seed I don't care how far you are
[1:14:38] covered up in sin if you are part of his
[1:14:40] his voice will come across you just like
[1:14:42] it come across Lazarus and woke him up
[1:14:45] from the
[1:14:48] grave you might have been covered up
[1:14:50] with theology you might have been
[1:14:52] covered up with sin but when the voice
[1:14:54] of the Resurrection
[1:15:00] help me Jesus brother said he's the
[1:15:03] final voice on all
[1:15:06] authority he has all the authority of
[1:15:09] everything God has the supreme authority
[1:15:13] you notice in this age William Brandon
[1:15:16] was not acting on his own stad he was
[1:15:19] getting this knowledge From Another
[1:15:21] World you know he said I I'm standing in
[1:15:24] two world
[1:15:26] but he's not getting this knowledge just
[1:15:28] he's not just making this up brother Mar
[1:15:30] was was illiterate and he only had a
[1:15:32] seventh grade education but brother
[1:15:34] Brandon was a very well-studied human
[1:15:36] being he studied the he studied out the
[1:15:39] scriptures he had studied out the the
[1:15:41] ideas of men he had he had read through
[1:15:43] Matthew Henry he had read through
[1:15:45] Spurgeon he had read through Calvin he
[1:15:48] had looked through it all but he did not
[1:15:50] get this knowledge from these books he
[1:15:53] got this knowledge from an Angelic being
[1:15:55] that was standing there to make sure
[1:15:57] that there would be a a correct
[1:15:59] anointing that would be released in this
[1:16:01] generation and I'll say if it wasn't
[1:16:03] released then we are missing Malachi 4
[1:16:06] and it's got to be
[1:16:07] fulfilled because we've got to have a
[1:16:09] restoration to be able to make a Rapture
[1:16:11] is that right but I happen to believe
[1:16:14] that this man William brandham was
[1:16:16] exactly in line with Malachi 4 and he
[1:16:18] was standing there grabbing a revelation
[1:16:21] from almighty God that set him in that
[1:16:24] set him him in an order so that you can
[1:16:26] make it through the worst of
[1:16:31] Ages I'll say this that this prophetic
[1:16:35] Authority is a supreme authority they
[1:16:37] could not understand Eli they could not
[1:16:40] understand water baptism they could not
[1:16:42] understand serpent seed but a prophet
[1:16:45] even though 400 tried to stop him but
[1:16:47] one Prophet stood for
[1:16:51] truth I tell you it matters where the
[1:16:53] voice is coming from
[1:16:58] brother Christian it's real power behind
[1:17:00] it I say there's real power behind this
[1:17:03] voice he'll wake you up and get rid of
[1:17:06] your
[1:17:07] problems you think you had problems
[1:17:09] Lazarus had some bad problems he's a
[1:17:12] whole he was a whole lot worse off than
[1:17:13] any of you sitting here today I you can
[1:17:16] name the sickest person in here but
[1:17:17] Lazarus was a whole lot worse off but
[1:17:19] when The Voice come against him when the
[1:17:21] voice came against death all of a sudden
[1:17:23] it woke something up
[1:17:25] you see you see that same voice spoke to
[1:17:28] the woman at the well that day and she
[1:17:30] had more critics than anybody sitting
[1:17:32] here she had a whole town that knew what
[1:17:34] she had done they she had she had had
[1:17:36] relationships with people that were of a
[1:17:39] great stature but this voice that was
[1:17:41] speaking to her said I that speak unto
[1:17:44] you I am he he was greater than her
[1:17:47] critics he was greater than her H he was
[1:17:50] greater than her
[1:17:53] past when she heard the master speak
[1:17:56] that message satisfied her that
[1:17:58] Hallelujah she was going to receive a
[1:18:00] seventh man that would make her stay
[1:18:03] with the
[1:18:05] word now you know good and well the
[1:18:07] world's offered you everything there is
[1:18:09] it's through everything ain't that right
[1:18:11] brother Randle it's threw everything at
[1:18:13] you trying to get you you could have
[1:18:15] been serving God and you could have took
[1:18:17] your gift to another place you could
[1:18:19] have been you could have you could have
[1:18:20] took your family and done great things
[1:18:21] with your gift but because a voice
[1:18:23] spoken to you in this generation and
[1:18:25] told you to stay in this field to stay
[1:18:28] right here the master spoke to you and
[1:18:29] say you stay right here it might not
[1:18:31] look like you're flourishing right now
[1:18:33] but let me say this you're going to
[1:18:35] flourish on that side like never
[1:18:39] before the master speaking unto you do
[1:18:42] you hear his voice stay in this field
[1:18:45] stay in this message stay in this
[1:18:49] truth he's offered you
[1:18:52] everything but it ain't got no power
[1:18:54] over an elect elected seat of
[1:19:00] God you see the lutherans had the word
[1:19:02] for their season and they organized it
[1:19:06] the wlans had their word for their
[1:19:08] season and then they
[1:19:11] organized from religion to religion the
[1:19:14] Lutheran failed the methodists failed
[1:19:17] but God has raised up other so it has
[1:19:19] gone on through the years until the last
[1:19:21] day there is again another people in the
[1:19:23] land who under their Messenger will be
[1:19:25] the final voice to the final age yes sir
[1:19:29] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:19:30] of God it is its own mouthpiece so God
[1:19:33] is turning on
[1:19:35] her he will confound her through the
[1:19:38] prophet and the bride for the voice of
[1:19:40] God will be in her yes it
[1:19:48] is I'm gonna give you a second to enjoy
[1:19:51] it that voice is in her yes it is
[1:19:56] because it says do you read do you read
[1:19:58] the Bible do you believe the Bible
[1:20:01] because it says in the last chapter of
[1:20:03] Revelations verse 17 the spirit and the
[1:20:06] bride say
[1:20:08] come once more the world will hear
[1:20:11] direct from God as at Pentecost but of
[1:20:13] course that word bride will be
[1:20:15] repudiated as in the first
[1:20:18] age what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:20:21] I'm saying you're anointed to
[1:20:23] speak I'm saying you ain't got to be
[1:20:25] pushed off in some
[1:20:27] corner I know the religions of the world
[1:20:29] have had tried to threaten you and try
[1:20:31] to make you believe that this message
[1:20:33] ain't right but I say this that you are
[1:20:34] anointed to speak You're anointed to
[1:20:36] take a open book in this generation and
[1:20:39] go out there and prophesy and speak the
[1:20:41] same things you don't have to recreate
[1:20:43] the new you don't have to recreate the
[1:20:45] will you don't have to create something
[1:20:46] just take what them tape
[1:20:50] say I'm going tell you right now I take
[1:20:52] what them tapes say and I've never seen
[1:20:54] seen one time that it's to come against
[1:20:56] the powers of the enemy and it's ever
[1:20:57] been thed this message is
[1:21:03] alive what are you saying brother Angel
[1:21:05] I'm saying you're anointed I'm saying

[1:21:11] you're anointed sister Melissa I'm
[1:21:13] saying you're
[1:21:16] anointed you mean it's that simple yes I
[1:21:19] do because the message is
[1:21:22] enough the message is enough our
[1:21:24] headship brought us this message so all
[1:21:27] you got to do is stay under the message
[1:21:29] stay under the anointing stay under this
[1:21:31] power because the enemy is challenging
[1:21:35] you he's challenging you to stay with
[1:21:37] this
[1:21:42] word brother Ron says something and I I
[1:21:45] always I'm I'm very I'm marveled at this
[1:21:47] statement how did you get here and why
[1:21:50] are you still
[1:21:53] here and you know good and well he ain't
[1:21:55] just challenging brother Ron he ain't
[1:21:57] just challenging the ministry here but
[1:21:59] he is challenging every single one of
[1:22:00] you to stay with this
[1:22:02] message but what makes you keep
[1:22:04] believing that the message is right it
[1:22:07] must be the same seed that came from the
[1:22:10] father that is dwelling in you that
[1:22:13] constantly keeps you here it keeps you
[1:22:15] clean and when the voice said now listen
[1:22:18] to this you you know that ain't right
[1:22:19] there's something on the inside of you
[1:22:21] said now that's a lie from the devil
[1:22:22] that's a spirit from the devil and he
[1:22:24] know knows how to manipulate it in such
[1:22:25] a way that make it look
[1:22:28] right come on somebody they can do all
[1:22:31] they want to with William brandom
[1:22:32] stories they can say 16 men didn't fall
[1:22:35] off a bridge they can say that a cloud
[1:22:37] didn't happen they can say it was a
[1:22:38] rocket fuel that created all them things
[1:22:40] they could say all that but they cannot
[1:22:42] question the authority of a man meeting
[1:22:44] an angel in a cave that gives you and I
[1:22:47] the ability to believe that not even
[1:22:49] cancer shall stand before the prayer of
[1:22:51] a righteous human being
[1:22:54] come on somebody they can attack all
[1:22:56] they want to out there in the world but
[1:22:58] they cannot stop thus sayith the
[1:23:05] Lord so what am I saying I'm saying that
[1:23:08] the same spirit that is in you is
[1:23:11] Anointed to speak back to that
[1:23:16] demon ah blessed be the name of the
[1:23:20] Lord why how how can you be so steadfast
[1:23:24] you might ask me that sister J how how
[1:23:26] could you be so steadfast when the enemy
[1:23:27] constantly attacks and assails it's it's
[1:23:30] kind of like Abraham had a revelation he
[1:23:33] had nobody else understood it Against
[1:23:35] All Odds he was standing against
[1:23:36] everybody that disbelieved in what the
[1:23:38] angel was talking to him and saying
[1:23:40] things to him but he knew that he was
[1:23:41] fellowshiping with Elohim he recognized
[1:23:44] the voice that had led him all the way
[1:23:46] from his youth he was leading him to a
[1:23:48] destination and he took him when he was
[1:23:50] baring when he was baren in his own W
[1:23:52] and his own his own wife was baring his
[1:23:54] own life could not produce seed he was
[1:23:56] able that voice that was speaking unto
[1:23:59] him was able to turn his deadness into
[1:24:02] life he was able to say the same thing
[1:24:05] that Ezekiel said to them dry bones to
[1:24:07] come alive on the inside of Abraham and
[1:24:10] Abraham had a
[1:24:12] revelation no matter how mad how mad the
[1:24:15] opposition got no matter how they tried
[1:24:17] to make fun of him and mock him and
[1:24:19] criticize him say you call yourself a
[1:24:21] father of Nations you ain't even got
[1:24:23] your own self a boy yet
[1:24:27] you know good and well that you got them
[1:24:28] same enemies that are lying to you you
[1:24:31] say you going to make a Rapture but
[1:24:32] you're still here you say you're going
[1:24:34] to overcome but you're still here we
[1:24:36] ain't seen leosia we ain't seen Los
[1:24:38] Angeles Fall underneath the water you
[1:24:40] stick around wrong enough you going
[1:24:42] to I don't know whether we go before it
[1:24:45] or whether we go after it all I know is
[1:24:47] I'm
[1:24:48] gone I know that it was an earthquake
[1:24:50] That Shook place on Easter morning and
[1:24:52] it might be just that way that a
[1:24:54] rapturing of the saints that all of a
[1:24:56] sudden earthquakes and we're
[1:25:00] gone but Abraham had a
[1:25:08] revelation had a
[1:25:11] revelation now Hagar stepped in but
[1:25:14] Abraham knew that it had to come through
[1:25:18] Sarah this MDC stood in this generation
[1:25:20] there was a lot of people that stood
[1:25:22] close to it and they watched it
[1:25:25] but MDC knew who the seed was meant for
[1:25:28] there was a lot of people that heard it
[1:25:30] there was a lot of people that stood by
[1:25:32] but this one was elected to receive a
[1:25:36] body change to produce a
[1:25:40] supernatural Abraham was put through
[1:25:42] some testing he was supposed to go some
[1:25:44] of the through what we would say some of
[1:25:45] the greatest
[1:25:47] trials and you waited all your life
[1:25:49] brother Shannon to see brother Dyan in
[1:25:50] his
[1:25:52] condition but now he
[1:25:55] here but now God is requiring something
[1:25:57] greater for you he's now asking you to
[1:25:59] take your son and take him and climb
[1:26:01] upon the mountain about three days
[1:26:03] journey there and take him and lay him
[1:26:05] on the
[1:26:08] altar Abraham had a revelation and
[1:26:11] brother Joey sent me this this week he
[1:26:13] said now he said brother maram said now
[1:26:15] stand in your fortified condition he
[1:26:17] said live die sink or drown you stay
[1:26:19] right there just the same when Abraham
[1:26:21] the father of the faithful pulled out
[1:26:23] that knife and pulled hair back on on
[1:26:25] that child's head to cut his throat he
[1:26:26] said I'm persuaded that God is able to
[1:26:28] raise him up from the dead in the figure
[1:26:30] that I fill him in he said he was
[1:26:32] willing to follow the word of God to the
[1:26:34] end you get
[1:26:36] it sometimes God's going to ask hard
[1:26:39] things of
[1:26:40] you sometimes God's going to require you
[1:26:43] to stand when nobody else is willing to
[1:26:47] stand but no matter what it is you stay
[1:26:51] right
[1:26:52] there no matter what you you got to go
[1:26:54] through no matter what you got to pass
[1:26:56] through stay right
[1:27:00] there if everything seems to be you
[1:27:04] can't go one inch further go that
[1:27:08] inch CU said I ain't got much room to
[1:27:11] walk you take one step you go that one
[1:27:14] step and if you hit the wall stand there
[1:27:15] until God makes a way through it I say
[1:27:18] stand in this message live in this
[1:27:20] message believe this message
[1:27:24] said in Ephesian church he he said now
[1:27:25] let this be known scripture does not
[1:27:27] play with words he said whatever is in
[1:27:29] the record is there for the anointed
[1:27:31] eyes to see it he said it's there for a
[1:27:34] purpose I want I want to say this that
[1:27:36] you are elected to see it one
[1:27:38] way and that way is God's
[1:27:41] way he didn't have to give Eve anything
[1:27:44] else to overcome Satan he gave her the
[1:27:48] greatest thing he could ever give her
[1:27:50] when he gave her the word of God I'll
[1:27:52] say the message is enough but what God
[1:27:55] gave Eve there in the Garden of Eden it
[1:27:57] was enough to stop the Serpent's lies it
[1:27:59] was enough to stop the curse it was
[1:28:01] enough to keep her from every heartache
[1:28:03] but Jesus showed us what it would take
[1:28:06] to defeat Satan he didn't use his
[1:28:09] power he used the word brother Mar said
[1:28:13] there's a lot of people that
[1:28:14] misunderstand the anointing he said the
[1:28:17] anointing is not emotions the anointing
[1:28:19] is not shoutings he said those are
[1:28:21] blessings from God he said but the
[1:28:23] anointing is supreme power under control
[1:28:27] look at the maniac and or organ you look
[1:28:29] at it it was supreme power in control
[1:28:32] you look at it there in Chicago with
[1:28:34] those 300 men it was supreme power under
[1:28:36] control but when somebody goes to
[1:28:38] believing what the word of God said that
[1:28:41] right there is a Deathstroke to Satan
[1:28:43] when every man or every son and daughter
[1:28:45] of God can take God at his word it'll
[1:28:48] kill Satan every single
[1:28:50] time and Satan was standing there in the
[1:28:54] form of The Serpent and making all of
[1:28:56] these promises to
[1:28:59] e and you're right here in Satan's
[1:29:01] eating and he's making them same
[1:29:03] promises you can still serve God the way
[1:29:06] you
[1:29:08] feel who you after brother I'm after
[1:29:10] that devil I'm after that devil you can
[1:29:13] still serve God you can do what you want
[1:29:14] to still cut your hair still live there
[1:29:17] it is you can still do what you want to
[1:29:18] you can dress any way you want to and
[1:29:20] he'll make all kinds of promises to you
[1:29:22] can I quote a prophet to you he said but
[1:29:24] Satan can't keep any of his promises
[1:29:27] because he ain't got nothing to give he
[1:29:29] said he ain't got salvation and he ain't
[1:29:31] got L all of his kingdom is nothing but
[1:29:33] darkness and sin he said that is Satan's
[1:29:37] kingdom so if Satan is offering you
[1:29:40] something it's an empty
[1:29:43] lie well I say the same thing with his
[1:29:45] promises and his lies they ain't got no
[1:29:48] power behind
[1:29:50] it what are you saying brother I'm
[1:29:52] saying if the devil told you you're not
[1:29:53] good good enough it's an empty lie I'm
[1:29:56] saying if you're telling you that you're
[1:29:57] not elected it's an empty lie I'm saying
[1:29:59] if he says you ain't going to make the
[1:30:00] Rapture it's an empty lie and ain't got
[1:30:03] no power behind it but there is one
[1:30:05] voice that stood in this generation and
[1:30:07] it's got power behind it it's got
[1:30:08] anointing behind it you ain't got to
[1:30:11] scream at that devil you just stay right
[1:30:14] there you're
[1:30:18] anointed I say you're anointed to stand
[1:30:20] in the face of your foes and in your
[1:30:22] friends with this
[1:30:25] message what are you saying brother
[1:30:27] Andrew I'm saying this that if you're
[1:30:29] going to attempt to make it out of lay o
[1:30:30] a sea you better deck yourself out in
[1:30:32] the whole armor of
[1:30:33] God because God's got one intention he's
[1:30:36] got one intention it doesn't matter what
[1:30:38] you got to go through to get there he's
[1:30:39] got one intention that he's going to
[1:30:41] express his life right through you his
[1:30:43] word is going to be expressed you might
[1:30:44] have to go through trial after trial and
[1:30:46] test after test but God's going to bring
[1:30:48] you to a
[1:30:50] Perfection a lukewarm condition will
[1:30:53] never never produced
[1:30:55] gold but if it's hot if it's hot then
[1:30:59] the master can beat the drop out of
[1:31:02] it don't get comfortable sitting where
[1:31:05] you are don't get satisfied staying
[1:31:08] where you
[1:31:09] are sometimes it's good to go to church
[1:31:11] and take a good beating every once in a
[1:31:13] while to beat the dress off of you
[1:31:17] because lay out ofia is
[1:31:20] thick the smoke that is coming out of
[1:31:22] this bottom of pit it's thick it gets on
[1:31:25] your skin it gets in your spirit I say
[1:31:28] this you are
[1:31:32] anointed how you get rid of smoke you
[1:31:35] just burn the flame H
[1:31:37] hotter come on somebody burn it hotter
[1:31:40] so if you're going to get rid of the
[1:31:42] smoke you got to have a fire that's
[1:31:43] hotter than the fire that's over there I
[1:31:46] say this holy ghost in fire it'll make
[1:31:48] you dance and Shout I say Let the Fire
[1:31:51] of the Holy Ghost burn this message
[1:31:54] ain't getting cold it's getting hotter
[1:31:57] and hotter and
[1:32:01] hotter get rid of the smoke believe the
[1:32:11] message
[1:32:15] Hallelujah you see a life lived by the
[1:32:18] word will be the word
[1:32:21] expressed just like Enoch's life
[1:32:28] he was the only one that was walking
[1:32:31] this
[1:32:33] close but he's a type of you and
[1:32:35] me he's a type of the seventh seventh
[1:32:38] from
[1:32:39] Adam and Enoch walked so close to God
[1:32:42] and I love the scripture said Enoch
[1:32:43] walked with God and he was not for God
[1:32:46] took him so Enoch's life he was walking
[1:32:49] so much in harmony with God's word so
[1:32:52] that he literally bypassed last death he
[1:32:55] was expressing the abilities that even
[1:32:58] though you have got to go through the
[1:32:59] shadow of death you can walk with God
[1:33:02] even though you got to walk through some
[1:33:03] trials when you're all alone you can
[1:33:05] walk with God even when nobody else is
[1:33:07] with you you can walk with God when the
[1:33:09] enemy is Raging walk with God when Satan
[1:33:12] comes in like a flood walk with God he
[1:33:15] walks so close with God that he bypassed
[1:33:18] death and brother Mar said and who is
[1:33:20] this MDC he said you bypass your
[1:33:22] theophany in order to come here and
[1:33:24] stand Temptation so God was literally
[1:33:27] using you to fulfill a part of his
[1:33:30] three-fold purpose that you are
[1:33:35] expressing you see well I don't feel
[1:33:37] like I've ever done anything great
[1:33:39] brother will I never I never laid my
[1:33:41] hands on anybody and they got healed I
[1:33:43] never I never shout I never I never did
[1:33:45] any of the say things that brother Ron
[1:33:47] did or brother brother Homer or brother
[1:33:48] brandom I've never seen any of those
[1:33:50] things I want you to know whether you
[1:33:53] see one Supernatural thing or not you
[1:33:55] are expressing the scripture that God
[1:33:58] will not lose one of his owns because
[1:34:00] all that the father ha given unto me
[1:34:02] will come to me and I will in no wise
[1:34:05] cast out who cares if you ever produce a
[1:34:07] miracle who cares if you ever see the
[1:34:09] Supernatural who cares you are
[1:34:11] expressing the godhead deity in Christ's
[1:34:14] form
[1:34:18] again that's what he's W to have the
[1:34:21] preeminence in his church
[1:34:24] back in the church and brother random
[1:34:26] said in Christ of mystery he said there
[1:34:28] would be a Time come forth that he could
[1:34:30] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:34:33] godhead deity through his church and
[1:34:35] have the preeminence in his church on my
[1:34:37] what the anointed man now the anointed
[1:34:39] people oh my to bring back the anointed
[1:34:41] bride and bridegroom anointed by what by
[1:34:44] why accepting what Eve turned
[1:34:49] down what did she turn down she turned
[1:34:51] down the word and when she turned down
[1:34:53] the word she turned down the rights to
[1:34:55] the tree of life she turned down the
[1:34:57] ability to speak to the mountain she
[1:34:58] turned down the abilities he said but
[1:35:00] you are anointed with what Eve turned
[1:35:02] down and he comes back and you and I we
[1:35:05] accept it you see she stood there Eve
[1:35:08] stood there and she listened to it under
[1:35:11] that deceiving
[1:35:13] Spirit she listened to the LIE of the
[1:35:17] devil now it had some truth in
[1:35:21] it but do you know that a prophet said
[1:35:23] that you are predestinated not to listen
[1:35:25] to the
[1:35:26] devil you're predestinated not to listen
[1:35:29] to the devil a come on boo devil boo
[1:35:34] devil you are predestinated not to
[1:35:36] listen to the devil but I am
[1:35:38] predestinated to listen to everything
[1:35:40] that Papa God's got to say to me I know
[1:35:43] what age I'm living in I'm living in an
[1:35:45] eag age where everything has been turned
[1:35:47] back to be able to say say to them out
[1:35:50] it's a returning of the hearts back
[1:35:54] that's what that eag anointing is to do
[1:35:56] it's to restore back the faith of the
[1:35:58] Pentecostal fathers back of Spurgeon had
[1:36:02] some great
[1:36:04] things finny had some great things under
[1:36:07] the man age there were some great things
[1:36:09] there and they're
[1:36:10] quotable but it was not a perfect
[1:36:13] word it was not back to what Paul was
[1:36:16] teaching because there were some things
[1:36:18] that were broke off that's why when
[1:36:20] William Brandon was standing there in
[1:36:22] Sportsman Halla he's wondering about
[1:36:24] these things because it was still broke
[1:36:26] off but there was a supreme authority
[1:36:28] brother Chris that was standing there
[1:36:30] that all of a sudden he said a a super
[1:36:32] anointing come sweeping down through
[1:36:34] that that holl down there I said what
[1:36:36] are you hunting he said I was sitting
[1:36:38] there and I was wondering if M if Mark
[1:36:41] 11:22 through 24 was under the atonement
[1:36:44] he said I stood there and the scripture
[1:36:46] said have faith in God speak to the
[1:36:49] mountain speak to the mountain
[1:36:52] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:36:53] pray believe that you shall receive them
[1:36:56] you see those Redemptive RS that Adam
[1:36:59] sold us into he sold us that we lost all
[1:37:02] them RS but now they you see the first
[1:37:06] man Adam he lost all those things but
[1:37:09] the second man Adam came and restored
[1:37:11] all them things so you see under Adam
[1:37:15] all them channels was clogged up that
[1:37:18] power could not get through them
[1:37:19] channels that anointing could not get
[1:37:22] through them channels but under under
[1:37:23] the anointing of the seventh Angel's
[1:37:25] message every promise is personally your
[1:37:28] possession so it wasn't just William
[1:37:31] brandom speaking to a storm it wasn't
[1:37:33] just him talking to a fish it wasn't
[1:37:35] just Hattie but it's your anointing it's
[1:37:37] your power this is
[1:37:49] your
[1:37:50] Hallelujah Don't Be Afraid little
[1:37:52] children greater is he that is in you
[1:37:55] than he that is in the
[1:37:57] world I Know The Enemy the Antichrist
[1:37:59] spirit is coming in this generation like
[1:38:01] never before but you don't have to be
[1:38:03] afraid you got mountains in front of you
[1:38:05] but I say speak to the mountain speak to
[1:38:08] the mountain you might not see the
[1:38:09] mountain move but if you can see the
[1:38:11] grain of sand move keep on speaking just
[1:38:13] speak to the
[1:38:16] Rock what are you saying brother Andrew
[1:38:18] I'm saying that God has provided you
[1:38:20] anointing in this generation that has
[1:38:21] released the supernatural power to
[1:38:24] believe and the believer takes God at
[1:38:26] his word and right here in the midst of
[1:38:28] Satan's
[1:38:29] Eden you will
[1:38:32] win what did David say when he was
[1:38:36] tapping into this day when William
[1:38:39] brandom comes he doesn't choose from
[1:38:41] first Thessalonians and he doesn't
[1:38:43] choose from First Corinthians but he
[1:38:44] goes all the way back there to David and
[1:38:47] he preaches from there the Rapture in
[1:38:49] Psalms chapter 27 the Lord is my light
[1:38:51] and my salvation but he said for in the
[1:38:55] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:39:00] Pavilion remember what the vision said
[1:39:02] I'll meet you in there in the secret of
[1:39:05] his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall
[1:39:08] set me upon a rock what are you saying
[1:39:10] brother Andrew I'm saying that what you
[1:39:12] are under is a Rapture
[1:39:16] anointing the rest of the world ain't
[1:39:18] Anointed with it but you're Anointed
[1:39:20] with it so that's got to make you an
[1:39:23] exclusive class of
[1:39:26] people that's why I don't get off if you
[1:39:28] message people it's because y'all think
[1:39:29] you're the only ones going to make
[1:39:31] it no we
[1:39:34] don't there's a whole lot of Ages before
[1:39:36] us is going to make
[1:39:39] it come on somebody I didn't put myself
[1:39:42] here brother Chester I didn't say I was
[1:39:44] an exclusive class I didn't make myself
[1:39:47] believe this I didn't he said this about
[1:39:50] me he said you're a royal priesthood a
[1:39:53] chosen gener you people think you're
[1:39:55] something well I'll take it up with
[1:39:57] almighty God he elected me for this
[1:39:59] generation and I'm GNA run with
[1:40:01] everything that's within me I'm a final
[1:40:03] voice to the final generation so I'm
[1:40:05] going to stand under this anointing I'm
[1:40:07] going to believe this message and I'm
[1:40:08] going to
[1:40:10] run I might have to jump through some
[1:40:12] hurdles but I'm going run I might have
[1:40:14] to cross some Creeks but I'm going run I
[1:40:16] might have to go through the desert but
[1:40:18] I'm going to
[1:40:19] run I might have to go through hail and
[1:40:21] high water but I'm going to run I might
[1:40:24] lose some friends but I'm going to run I
[1:40:27] might make the devil mad but I'm going
[1:40:29] to
[1:40:30] run I say take this message and run with
[1:40:34] everything that's within you sacrifice
[1:40:37] your
[1:40:43] doubts what did the Book of Daniel say
[1:40:47] you watch it you watch Revelations 9 and
[1:40:50] Revelations 10 you watch Daniel 11 you
[1:40:53] watch Daniel 12 you watch the parallel
[1:40:55] in the scriptures and you notice that
[1:40:58] the Bible said and they in Daniel 11:32
[1:41:01] and they that do know their God shall be
[1:41:05] strong and do exploits if you know you
[1:41:09] shall be strong and
[1:41:12] do now you can't do
[1:41:14] nothing without being strong and you
[1:41:17] can't be strong without a knowledge but
[1:41:20] if somebody has given and granted you
[1:41:21] this knowledge it'll make you strong
[1:41:24] right here in the midst of all of it
[1:41:25] when all kinds of lies of hypocrisy have
[1:41:27] come against the Church of the Living
[1:41:29] God that the people that do know their
[1:41:32] God I wonder how many people know God it
[1:41:35] ain't just some ideology ain't something
[1:41:37] that William brandham told you about it
[1:41:38] ain't something brother Ron told you
[1:41:39] about but you know him you know him in
[1:41:41] the power of Resurrection you believe
[1:41:43] him to be true you've tested his word
[1:41:45] you found out that he is the only true
[1:41:47] and wise God so if you do know God it'll
[1:41:50] make you strong in the midst of the lies
[1:41:53] look look at Daniel 11:32 put it up
[1:41:55] there for me
[1:41:56] sis and such as do wickedly against the
[1:42:00] Covenant shall be corrupt by flatteries
[1:42:03] so it shows you there is going to be
[1:42:04] some Wicked lies there is going to be
[1:42:06] some flatteries of of seducing spirits
[1:42:09] but the people that refuse to give in to
[1:42:12] the devil's lies and and his his ability
[1:42:14] to tickle your ears and stand
[1:42:17] there you shall be strong I say how are
[1:42:21] you strong I'd say it's by knowing all
[1:42:23] my God that this wasn't some weak angel
[1:42:25] that stood up in this generation but it
[1:42:26] was a mighty a strong
[1:42:29] angel look at Revelations 9 and look at
[1:42:32] Revelations chapter 10 and the word that
[1:42:35] connects the two is and it's a
[1:42:37] conjunction they work together so you
[1:42:40] see right here in Revelations 9 and you
[1:42:42] see Revelations 10 you see the spirit
[1:42:44] that this church is fighting
[1:42:50] against I read to you some very powerful
[1:42:52] things last night
[1:42:54] not but that ain't for days going
[1:42:58] by come on somebody I say I say this
[1:43:01] voice that is speaking unto you it's
[1:43:03] greater than
[1:43:03] nervousness I say you can be strong in
[1:43:06] knowing you're God that anxiety has got
[1:43:08] to go that fear has got to go there
[1:43:11] ain't no place in the Church of the
[1:43:12] Living God for fear to be there and
[1:43:13] Faith at the same time so faith has got
[1:43:15] to ride one of them's got to override
[1:43:17] the other and I say these people know
[1:43:19] they're gone and they're going to be
[1:43:20] strong and they're going to do exploits
[1:43:22] they're going to do marvelous
[1:43:25] things they're going to do Supernatural
[1:43:27] phenomenal
[1:43:29] things so it ain't just for William
[1:43:31] brandham it ain't just for this brother
[1:43:33] and that brother I say it's for the
[1:43:35] little housewife I say it's for the
[1:43:37] woman that chooses to be a janitor I say
[1:43:39] it's for the mama that's been praying
[1:43:41] for her children that's been asking I
[1:43:42] don't know she might be 60 something
[1:43:44] years old but she's still been asking
[1:43:45] and she's still been praying I believe
[1:43:47] it's that kind of woman that'll do
[1:43:49] exploits in this generation and you
[1:43:50] might only see one of your prayers ever
[1:43:52] answered but it was worth praying
[1:43:55] for I say it's worth fighting for in the
[1:43:58] midst of all of Le Osa you choose not to
[1:44:00] give up on God's promises you choose not
[1:44:03] to give in the devil's
[1:44:07] lies
[1:44:09] notice I just want to read these things
[1:44:11] and I I know I I've probably cooked you
[1:44:14] Goose a few times already
[1:44:16] but but Daniel said and at that time
[1:44:21] chapter 12 shall Michael stand up now
[1:44:25] who is Michael it's Christ The Mighty
[1:44:28] Angel you look at Revelations Chap 10:1
[1:44:31] and I saw another Mighty Angel who is
[1:44:33] that up there it's
[1:44:35] Christ and at that time shall Michael
[1:44:37] stand up this ain't a time to sit down
[1:44:41] it's a time to stand up the great Prince
[1:44:44] which standeth through the children of
[1:44:46] thy people and there shall be a time of
[1:44:48] trouble such as never was since there
[1:44:51] was a nation even to that same time and
[1:44:53] at that time my people shall be
[1:44:55] delivered everyone that should be found
[1:44:57] written in the book and many of them
[1:44:59] that sleep in the dust of the Earth
[1:45:00] shall wake some to everlasting life and
[1:45:03] some to shame and everlasting contempt
[1:45:06] and they that be
[1:45:09] wise the people that do know their
[1:45:13] God and they that be
[1:45:16] wise now where did you get this wisdom
[1:45:19] from this understanding has got to come
[1:45:23] from the
[1:45:24] almighty this that has been delivered to
[1:45:26] you in this generation to be over to
[1:45:28] able to overcome the very prominent
[1:45:32] Spirit of religion it is a spirit of
[1:45:37] wisdom to be able to decipher between
[1:45:41] right and wrong the Bible said try the
[1:45:45] spirits and they that be wise shall sign
[1:45:49] shine as the brightness of the firmament
[1:45:53] they that turn many to righteousness as
[1:45:56] the Stars forever and ever brother Mar
