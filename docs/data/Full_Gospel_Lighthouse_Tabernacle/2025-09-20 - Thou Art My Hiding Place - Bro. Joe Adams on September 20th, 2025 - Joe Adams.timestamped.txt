[34:56] He'll wipe your tears away
[35:00] and hold you close.
[35:04] Oh,
[35:05] do you know
[35:09] that this won't be the end? Cuz there's
[35:14] so much more than this.
[35:18] We're almost home.
[35:24] We might be here for now and don't
[35:27] forget where we're going.
[35:32] Going to trade this world for a better
[35:36] place. Going to wave goodbye to the hurt
[35:40] and the pain. We'll dance on streets of
[35:43] gold when we get where we're going.
[35:50] But you see what our hearts have known
[35:53] for heaven. We were not made for here.
[35:57] We were made for heaven.
[36:03] Oh,
[36:07] and the ones we've lost along the way
[36:12] will run to me
[36:15] again.
[36:17] Oh, my heart can hardly wait for heaven.
[36:26] where death is finally lost and sing.
[36:31] Believers stand victory
[36:35] and bow before the king of kings in
[36:40] heaven.
[36:44] We might be here for now, but don't
[36:47] forget where we're going.
[36:52] Going to trade this world for a better
[36:56] place. Going to wave goodbye to the hurt
[37:00] and the pain. We'll dance on streams of
[37:03] gold when we get where we're going.
[37:09] Going to see what our hearts have known
[37:13] forever. We were not made for you. We
[37:17] were made for heaven.
[37:19] [Music]
[37:21] [Applause]
[37:23] Oh,
[37:26] we were made for heaven.
[37:30] Don't forget where we're going.
[37:35] Don't forget where we're going.
[37:39] We were made for heaven.
[37:43] [Music]
[37:48] [Applause]
[38:07] The fact is
[38:10] you're caught in
[38:12] a battle.
[38:17] and you'll feel like
[38:20] you're losing
[38:22] the war.
[38:27] And the fact is that it's raged on for
[38:32] so long
[38:37] that your steps have
[38:40] grown weary.
[38:42] and soul.
[38:46] Oh, but that's just
[38:50] the fact of
[38:52] the matter.
[38:57] The truth has
[39:00] not left you behind.
[39:07] When the facts have
[39:10] you bound up
[39:12] in sorrow,
[39:14] [Music]
[39:17] the truth says you're free one more
[39:23] time.
[39:27] And the truth is
[39:30] that you're not
[39:32] forsen.
[39:37] And the truth is
[39:40] you won't be
[39:43] denied.
[39:47] Well, the facts may may be stacked up
[39:53] against you right now.
[39:57] But the truth is
[40:00] that God is on your side.
[40:08] Now, in fact, there
[40:10] been times you
[40:13] have questioned,
[40:18] should you throw up
[40:21] your hands and just give in?
[40:28] And in fact, you
[40:31] have said there's
[40:33] just no reason
[40:38] to keep fighting
[40:41] when you'll never
[40:44] win.
[40:45] [Music]
[40:46] Oh,
[40:48] but that's not
[40:51] the end of
[40:53] this story.
[40:58] The truth says
[41:01] you shall overcome
[41:04] [Music]
[41:08] when the facts have
[41:11] you almost
[41:14] defeated.
[41:19] The truth is you've already
[41:24] won.
[41:28] For the truth is
[41:32] you're not
[41:34] forsaken.
[41:35] [Music]
[41:39] And the truth is
[41:41] you won't be
[41:44] denied.
[41:48] All the facts may may be stacked up
[41:54] against you right now,
[41:59] but the truth is the truth is yes. The
[42:04] truth is that God is on your
[42:10] side.
[42:13] [Music]
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:24] Hallelujah.
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't you rejoice in the
[42:34] Lord this afternoon
[42:37] &gt;&gt; to know that the Lord is on your side?
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Glory be to Jesus.
[42:43] Hallelujah.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil, "The Lord's on my side."
[42:48] And that's the truth of the matter.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:54] Let the bride of Jesus Christ rejoice.
[42:58] Hallelujah.
[42:59] Let all heaven hear you. Say,
[43:01] "Hallelujah."
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful that God is on your
[43:07] side? The God of heaven. Hallelujah. The
[43:10] God of the universe. is on our side.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Woo!
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; King Jesus is in the room.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; King Jesus is in the room.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; And that's what we came for tonight
[43:26] &gt;&gt; is to have a talk with the master.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; The king of the universe and he has
[43:30] showed up. His children are here to
[43:32] worship him.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; And my what a presence that is in this
[43:36] place. I just be honest, the spirit of
[43:39] God has been so near today. Hey, I just
[43:42] I want you to know that whatever you
[43:44] have need of, I believe that God is here
[43:46] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[43:49] that you could ever ask or think.
[43:52] I don't even think you have to wait till
[43:53] the end of the service tonight to get a
[43:55] touch from the master. I believe that
[43:57] the master is right here, right now, and
[44:00] he can touch every single one of your
[44:01] needs. Have you come expecting this
[44:04] weekend? Well, I believe God is going to
[44:07] do something for you that you can't even
[44:09] comprehend this weekend.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; I told Brother Joe, Full Gospel
[44:13] Lighthouse is on the cusp of a great
[44:16] breakthrough. And I believe that this
[44:18] weekend is set up from the very mind of
[44:20] Almighty God.
[44:21] [Applause]
[44:24] Hallelujah.
[44:28] As we get ready to invite the man of God
[44:30] this evening, we have great confidence
[44:33] in this man of God. He's been used
[44:34] mightily around the world. I've traveled
[44:37] with him and he's been a bosom friend to
[44:39] me. But his ministry speaks it louder
[44:43] than even words could say. We have the
[44:46] utmost confidence and the respect for
[44:48] the man of God. And when you begin to
[44:49] respect the gift of God, you can allow
[44:52] the Holy Spirit to begin to use him and
[44:54] to speak right to your needs. And that's
[44:56] what we're asking this weekend, that God
[44:58] would use the man of God to speak to us
[45:02] in a very specific way. So, as we get
[45:04] ready to invite our brother Joel, let's
[45:06] just sing that song.
[45:10] Do you see? That's not the song, but
[45:15] Amazing
[45:17] Grace
[45:20] shall always
[45:22] be
[45:24] my song
[45:26] of praise.
[45:30] For it was grace
[45:36] that bought
[45:38] my liberties.
[45:46] I do not know
[45:53] just why
[45:55] he came to love me so.
[46:02] [Music]
[46:04] He looked
[46:06] beyond
[46:09] all my hearts and he saw
[46:14] my need.
[46:19] I shall
[46:22] forever
[46:27] live
[46:29] my eyes
[46:31] to Calary.
[46:33] [Music]
[46:36] Oh,
[46:39] the cross
[46:43] where Jesus
[46:46] died.
[46:48] He died for you and he died
[46:52] for me.
[46:54] How marvelous
[47:00] the grace
[47:02] that
[47:04] I
[47:07] s
[47:13] beyond
[47:16] all my thoughts and he saw
[47:21] my knees.
[47:25] I shout forever.
[47:27] I shout
[47:30] for
[47:33] [Music]
[47:50] Heat. Heat.
[47:58] [Music]
[48:08] The praise
[48:10] and
[48:12] our
[48:15] [Music]
[48:21] we are
[48:24] [Music]
[48:28] in song.
[48:30] [Music]
[48:33] Amen. Aren't you thankful
[48:35] &gt;&gt; that he looked beyond your faults?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; He looked beyond your failures. He
[48:41] looked beyond your weaknesses. He looked
[48:43] beyond your humanity and he saw your
[48:46] need
[48:49] &gt;&gt; and he knew you had a need of him, a
[48:52] need of healing, a need of deliverance,
[48:54] a need of the Holy Ghost. and he looked
[48:56] beyond all that
[48:59] and he's coming tonight to minister to
[49:01] your need to be a personal God for you
[49:05] tonight. Let's just go to him in prayer.
[49:06] Father, what a great privilege we have
[49:09] before us tonight.
[49:12] Lord, we stand before the purchase of
[49:14] the blood, Lord.
[49:17] Lord, the bride of this last day,
[49:19] Father, and you would come in this hour,
[49:22] Father, through a vindicated message and
[49:24] begin to Lord, reveal yourself like no
[49:27] other time, no other age, God. And you
[49:31] would come, Lord God, not only to meet
[49:33] the needs of the people, but so
[49:34] encapsulate them with a message, Lord,
[49:36] to prepare them for a body change, a
[49:39] rapture, Lord. And Lord, prepare them
[49:41] for the future home. Lord, an invisible
[49:44] union has been taking place many years
[49:46] now. And Father, we just want to come
[49:48] tonight and put our shoulder to the
[49:51] wheel here at Full Gospel Lighthouse.
[49:53] Lord, not that we have anything special
[49:55] to say, but God, all that we can do is
[49:58] preach what Paul preached. All that we
[50:00] can do, Lord, is stand as William
[50:02] Brandham stood, Lord, and preach the
[50:03] same gospel, the same message, the same
[50:06] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[50:10] and forever. And we invite you to come
[50:12] tonight, Lord, to minister to every
[50:14] heart. Father, you'd come and minister
[50:16] to every need tonight. You know those
[50:18] that are here, those that are streaming,
[50:20] God, I ask that you would be with the
[50:22] Tagert family, Lord, as they're
[50:24] assembled together, Lord, in that room
[50:26] there, all the siblings gathered,
[50:28] Brother Zach, just text me, Lord. And I
[50:31] just pray, God, that you would go forth
[50:33] in a voice that you'd resound and
[50:35] thunder forth, oh God, a a word of
[50:37] comfort and peace to that family and
[50:39] their needs, Father.
[50:42] Lord, we love you tonight.
[50:45] If we yield our vessels to you, our ears
[50:47] to hear, Lord, our lips to speak, and
[50:51] our hearts to receive. Now may you may
[50:54] Lord we ask that you would go forth now
[50:57] through the preaching of your word
[50:58] through power and demonstration the
[51:00] anointing of your spirit.
[51:03] We ask that you have your way tonight.
[51:05] It's a special night. Lord say why is it
[51:08] special? Because the king is here. The
[51:11] angel of the Lord accompanies the
[51:13] message. So Lord I'm going to do my
[51:15] part. I'm going to preach the message
[51:18] and I invite you to come. stand here
[51:21] Lord and begin to anoint each and every
[51:25] aspect of it tonight. For we ask it in
[51:28] Jesus name.
[51:30] Amen and amen.
[51:32] So we bring greetings to you tonight
[51:34] from our pastor, brother Tim, the saints
[51:36] there Evening Light Tabernacle, your
[51:38] sister church.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; And it's uh I'm certainly honored to
[51:44] have my family with me and Lauren and
[51:47] Weston drove up from Kentucky. So, we're
[51:49] glad to have them here with us this
[51:51] weekend. And my beautiful wife. If I can
[51:53] preach half as good as my family can
[51:55] sing, we're going to have good time
[51:57] tonight.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a resounding yes.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, we want to thank brother
[52:05] Andrew and Brother Ron and for having us
[52:08] here, Brother Matt. We love the Spencer
[52:09] family. We go back many, many, many
[52:12] years. When I was just a boy, just came
[52:14] to the message. I went to brother Ron
[52:16] and said, "I feel the Lord calling me to
[52:18] preach." And I think I may have been 24,
[52:21] 25 at the time, even younger than that
[52:22] possibly. And here we are today. So, uh,
[52:26] it's not our first time here, but we're
[52:27] here tonight. And we just want to get
[52:29] ourselves out of the way and allow the
[52:31] Lord to speak. How many of you got a
[52:32] need tonight?
[52:34] &gt;&gt; So, as I was preparing and and traveling
[52:37] up, the Lord laid this thought on my
[52:38] heart. Thou art my hiding place.
[52:43] And we can take this it can turn here
[52:45] and I'm just going to follow the
[52:46] leadership of the Lord, but I know how
[52:48] it's going to go the first part of the
[52:49] service. So, we're going to look here in
[52:50] Psalms 32 and verse one and we're going
[52:53] to read down through verse 7 and we'll
[52:54] kind of get into the meat of the message
[52:56] tonight.
[53:00] Certainly good to see each and every one
[53:01] of you. The church has grown since the
[53:03] last time I've been here. Mercy.
[53:06] Brother Ron said we're not going to have
[53:07] everybody tonight. I'm like, my
[53:09] goodness, man.
[53:11] Where's the other half,
[53:14] man? Every seat's almost full.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord. God adding to the
[53:19] ministry. The we find here in Psalms 32
[53:23] and verse one, blessed is he whose
[53:25] transgressions is forgiven and whose
[53:28] sins is covered. Blessed is the man unto
[53:31] whom the Lord imputed not iniquity.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; In whose spirit there is no gal. When I
[53:38] kept silence, my bones waxed. Oh,
[53:40] through my roaring all day long. For day
[53:43] and night thy hand was heavy upon me.
[53:46] And that word heavy there means
[53:48] affliction.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; So thy hand was heavy upon me and my
[53:53] moisture is turned into a drought of
[53:56] summer. I acknowledge my sin unto thee,
[53:58] and my iniquity have I not hid. I said,
[54:01] I will confess my transgressions unto
[54:03] the Lord, and thou forgavest the
[54:06] iniquity of my sin. Sah, for in this
[54:11] for in this shall everyone that is godly
[54:13] pray unto thee, and in a time when thou
[54:16] mayest be found. Surely in the floods of
[54:18] great waters, they shall not come nigh
[54:21] unto him. And verse seven is where we
[54:23] bring in our thought from tonight. For
[54:25] thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt
[54:29] preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt
[54:32] compass me about with songs of
[54:35] deliverance. God bless you. You can have
[54:37] your seats tonight.
[54:47] Amen. Well, brother Mark said he drove
[54:49] two hours for this, so let's not
[54:50] disappoint.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; All right, Sister Christie, good to see
[54:55] you back in the back. How many ready to
[54:57] have church?
[54:59] &gt;&gt; All right. How ready for a move of God
[55:02] tonight?
[55:04] I believe that should be every time we
[55:05] come together, we should expect God to
[55:08] move. We should expect God to pour out
[55:10] himself. And we find here, I just want
[55:12] to kind of set the platform tonight. We
[55:14] find in verse four, David is a man
[55:16] that's well acquainted with afflictions.
[55:18] David is a man that was well acquainted
[55:21] with hard times and troubles. As we find
[55:23] in verse four, it says, "For day and
[55:25] night, thy hand was heavy upon me."
[55:29] Now, how many of you have felt the heavy
[55:31] hand of God throughout your life?
[55:33] There's been times God's hands been
[55:34] heavy upon you. Then there's been times
[55:37] God's hand been pulled back from you.
[55:39] And we find this during these time, you
[55:41] got to know who God is. But more
[55:43] importantly, you got to know who you are
[55:45] in God. You got to know your position in
[55:47] the body of Christ. And we find David
[55:50] knew what it meant to have difficulties.
[55:53] He knew what it meant to go hiding in
[55:55] fear of his life. David would cry out
[55:58] here, for thou art my hiding place.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; You know, he was well acquainted with
[56:05] hiding. Not that he was a coward, but he
[56:08] was a smart man. The Bible say he's a
[56:10] man after God's own heart.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; But even a man after God's own heart, he
[56:17] would hide himself back in fear of his
[56:20] life. And we find here we find David
[56:24] running or hiding from Saul's spear in
[56:26] 1st Samuel 18 and and 19. And we find
[56:29] him with Samuel at Naoth and Rama. We
[56:32] find them behind Jonathan's plan or at
[56:35] Naba at Nab with Aimc the priest or in
[56:38] Gath among the Philistines when he
[56:41] pretended to be mad. We find him in the
[56:43] cave of Adullum. We find him in the
[56:45] strongholds of Judah. We find him in the
[56:47] cave of Engeti. We find David again in
[56:49] the wilderness of Ze and with the
[56:51] Philistines at Ziglag and he fled to
[56:54] Jerusalem when Abselon was coming
[56:56] against him. So David was a man that was
[56:59] well acquainted with hiding
[57:05] &gt;&gt; and we would count this 10 to 11 times
[57:07] that he had major life events.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; And he remarks though in Psalms 32.
[57:17] Notice the strongholds of Judah in the
[57:21] cave of Engeti in the cave of Adullum
[57:23] was not his hiding place.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; The hiding place wasn't Ziglag or
[57:29] Jerusalem or the wilderness of Ze in
[57:32] Judah. So no matter where David found
[57:35] himself, he would acknowledge that thou
[57:37] art my hiding place. No matter where he
[57:41] found himself, whether he was in a cave,
[57:44] whether he was on the back side of the
[57:45] desert, whether he was running for his
[57:47] life, David didn't give the credit to
[57:49] the cave, he didn't give the credit to
[57:51] the wilderness. David gave the credit to
[57:54] Almighty God. No matter where he found
[57:57] himself, he said, "Thou, oh God, you are
[57:59] my hiding place."
[58:02] &gt;&gt; And church, he has to be your hiding
[58:05] place tonight. No matter where you find
[58:07] yourself, it may be cancer, it may be
[58:10] heart trouble, it may be diabetes, it
[58:13] may be a broken home, it may be a sour
[58:15] marriage, but wherever you find
[58:17] yourself, you have to find him that he
[58:20] is your hiding place.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; He has to be your hiding place.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; What is it, brother Joe, a hiding place?
[58:35] It's a covering. It's a shelter.
[58:38] It's a secret place. It's protection.
[58:43] I love how David would say, "Thou art my
[58:46] protection.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Thou art my shelter.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Thou art my secret place."
[58:58] Brother Mark, no matter what David
[59:00] faced,
[59:02] he had a consolation because he had a
[59:05] relationship with almighty God.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Now, if David can form such a
[59:10] relationship without the Holy Spirit,
[59:14] what kind of relationship can we form
[59:17] this evening?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; What kind of people should we be this
[59:20] evening with the outpouring of the Holy
[59:22] Ghost with the token that's been applied
[59:25] in this hour? What kind of people can we
[59:27] be if David could find him as a hiding
[59:30] place in his times of trouble? What
[59:32] about the bride? What about you and I
[59:35] here in Elton, Virginia, in Grotto,
[59:37] Virginia, wherever you come from
[59:39] tonight? Can't he be our hiding place?
[59:43] &gt;&gt; But notice David doesn't go just there.
[59:45] He says, "Thou shalt preserve me from
[59:48] trouble. Otherwise, you shall guard me
[59:50] from dangers.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; You shall preserve me." Not that we're
[59:54] free from having trouble, but you won't
[59:57] your troubles won't swallow you up.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, hey, we all go through trouble.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; How many of you ever not had a trouble?
[1:00:09] Some of you raise your hand.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Mercy. You may come and preach.
[1:00:16] We've all, whether you're young or old,
[1:00:18] you have faced some kind of trouble in
[1:00:20] your life.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; And you got to know that you know that
[1:00:24] you know when God remains silent that
[1:00:27] he's still God.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; That God is still on the scene. And the
[1:00:31] Bible would tell us in Psalms 34 that
[1:00:33] many are the afflictions of the
[1:00:36] righteous, but the Lord delivered them
[1:00:38] out of them all. Notice this word
[1:00:40] afflictions here is malignant,
[1:00:42] cancerous, life-threatening, unpleasant,
[1:00:45] evil, giving pain, unhappiness, misery,
[1:00:48] displeasing. But the promise doesn't lie
[1:00:50] in just the afflictions. We have a
[1:00:52] promise as sons and daughters of God.
[1:00:55] But the Lord,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; the Lord will deliver him out of them
[1:00:59] all. No matter where you find yourself,
[1:01:02] whether it's with cancer, whether it's
[1:01:03] with sugar diabetes, no matter where
[1:01:06] it's at, the Lord shall deliver. Why?
[1:01:08] because he's the believer's hiding
[1:01:10] place,
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; secret place, a sure place, a place of
[1:01:16] protection.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; See, we as Christians, we have good
[1:01:21] days.
[1:01:24] We have bad days. We're not immune from
[1:01:27] adversities and trials and hardships of
[1:01:30] this life. But our safety doesn't lie in
[1:01:34] our human intellect and our great
[1:01:36] abilities. Amen.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz there's some of you that are smarter
[1:01:41] than me and smarter than these brothers
[1:01:43] on the platform. And you know, if we was
[1:01:45] going by intellect,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; you'd be up here and we'd be out there.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; See, our safety doesn't rest in
[1:01:52] psychology. Our safety doesn't rest in
[1:01:54] man-made systems. It doesn't rest in
[1:01:57] man-made schemes and and traditions. But
[1:02:00] our safety, notice, church, our safety,
[1:02:03] our protection, it rest in the anointed
[1:02:06] word of God.
[1:02:09] So you can't find safety in a man.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Look, we got great men of God that this
[1:02:15] message puts out that it produces, but
[1:02:17] your safety doesn't rest in that man. It
[1:02:20] doesn't rest in any individual. Your
[1:02:22] safety, your security, your protection.
[1:02:25] It rests solely in the anointed word of
[1:02:28] God.
[1:02:30] Right?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; But a God, he allows us to go through
[1:02:35] things.
[1:02:37] He allows these things to mold us. You
[1:02:39] know that God puts something inside of
[1:02:40] you that only trials will bring out.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; God puts things inside of you,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; to mold you, to shape you, that only
[1:02:51] afflictions and difficulties will begin
[1:02:53] to pull out.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; No, no, they're not pleasant.
[1:02:57] A lot of times if we're honest, we like,
[1:02:59] why me?
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; What did I do to deserve this? All I
[1:03:05] want to do is serve God. And look at me
[1:03:06] now.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. We've all been there.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; But brother Bam says, "You got
[1:03:12] overcoming to do." He says, "Notice now.
[1:03:15] They that overcome shall inherit all
[1:03:16] things. They that overcome, see, he
[1:03:19] says, you have power to do it, but you
[1:03:21] got to be willing to lay it down." See,
[1:03:22] God could not push us through a little
[1:03:24] pipe, pull us out the other end, and
[1:03:26] then say, "Blessed is he that
[1:03:28] overcometh."
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; See, you had nothing to overcome. He
[1:03:31] pushed you through. But you got to make
[1:03:34] your decisions for yourself. I've got to
[1:03:36] make my decisions for myself. And in
[1:03:39] doing that, we show our faith and our
[1:03:41] respects to God. So, we got overcoming
[1:03:44] to do. Whether you're going to let the
[1:03:46] trial overtake you, whether you're going
[1:03:47] to let the sickness overcome you,
[1:03:49] whether you're going to let the
[1:03:50] adversities that you go through swallow
[1:03:52] you up, you got to make your decision
[1:03:54] tonight
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; that I'm going to stand for this truth.
[1:03:58] I'm going to stand for this message. I'm
[1:04:00] going to stand for this gospel. I got a
[1:04:02] hiding place in the word. And no matter
[1:04:04] what comes near me,
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; I shall not be moved. Tonight,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; we have a promise.
[1:04:14] Brother man will tell us and I know he
[1:04:16] says now Satan could not take them.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; He could not drown Noah in in the flood
[1:04:22] until the purpose of God had been
[1:04:24] finished.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Well, you're like, "Well, come on,
[1:04:28] brother Joe. That was thousands of years
[1:04:29] ago.
[1:04:31] He could not burn up the Hebrew children
[1:04:34] until the purpose of God had been
[1:04:36] finished." Oh, come on, brother Joe.
[1:04:38] You're telling us Bible stories.
[1:04:42] Notice he cannot kill Job. with boils
[1:04:44] and troubles until the purpose that God
[1:04:46] had had been finished. Neither could he,
[1:04:48] notice, neither could the lions eat
[1:04:50] Daniel until God's purpose had been
[1:04:53] finished. Neither could death in old age
[1:04:55] take Abraham until the purpose of God
[1:04:58] had been finished.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And neither
[1:05:04] can it take you.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And neither can it take you.
[1:05:12] You're looking at an example.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; You're looking at an example.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Lion's dens, fiery furnace, backside of
[1:05:22] the desert, whatever it is. Put whatever
[1:05:24] ter any type you want to put there. A
[1:05:27] man stage four cancer five years. Satan
[1:05:30] cannot take him until God's purpose had
[1:05:33] been finished.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Now, it doesn't mean that it's going to
[1:05:36] be cookies and cream and all that along
[1:05:38] the way. It's been rough. It's been a
[1:05:40] struggle. It's been, as we would say, a
[1:05:42] rocky road. But I'm here to tell you, he
[1:05:44] found a hiding place. He found a place
[1:05:47] of safety. He found a place to rest. No
[1:05:49] matter what he's going through, no
[1:05:51] matter what comes his way, know that he
[1:05:53] gets up here and he continues to preach
[1:05:55] the same word, the same anointed word of
[1:05:58] God to tell you, if I can do it, you can
[1:06:01] do it, too.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we don't put that on a man, but a
[1:06:06] man had found a hiding place in the
[1:06:08] word.
[1:06:12] So neither can it take you or take me
[1:06:15] until the purpose of God of our life is
[1:06:17] finished.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Notice there's a
[1:06:22] there's a
[1:06:26] when you get past 50, you forget things.
[1:06:31] But it's coming to me.
[1:06:34] It just may take a minute.
[1:06:37] My goodness.
[1:06:40] There's a quote, not brother Brandon,
[1:06:43] but there's a quote that says, "Hard
[1:06:44] times create strong men
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; and strong men create good times.
[1:06:53] And good times create weak men and weak
[1:06:58] men create hard times."
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Let me just say that again.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Hard times create strong men.
[1:07:09] Strong men create good times.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Good times create weak men and weak men
[1:07:16] create hard times. So this suggests that
[1:07:18] hardships builds character
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; and social strength. But notice we can
[1:07:23] apply this even in the Christian
[1:07:26] perspective.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Hard times create strong Christians.
[1:07:33] Notice when you're going through a
[1:07:35] battle, you get on your knees a whole
[1:07:37] lot more often than when you're not on
[1:07:39] the battlefield.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; When you're sitting on the mountaintop
[1:07:43] and everything's cookies and cream,
[1:07:45] everything's going great, you have no
[1:07:46] trouble in the home, there's no
[1:07:48] sickness, the kids are doing good, the
[1:07:50] the wife is good, the marriage is good,
[1:07:52] the finances are good, you don't pray.
[1:07:54] But let me tell you, when the rug is
[1:07:56] poured out from underneath you and your
[1:07:57] sickness is in your body and you're
[1:07:59] facing cancer and your and the enemy's
[1:08:01] coming to try to destroy your family,
[1:08:03] that's when you hit your knees. That
[1:08:05] makes a strong Christian. That makes a
[1:08:07] strong believer. But I want you to know
[1:08:09] tonight, church, even in those times,
[1:08:12] you can find comfort and peace in the
[1:08:14] word of God.
[1:08:18] [Applause]
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, notice. So, why do troubles come?
[1:08:25] How many you've ever asked that
[1:08:27] question?
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, show hands. It's okay.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:08:34] We all have.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. Work with me tonight.
[1:08:41] Why does God let troubles come? The
[1:08:44] age-old question.
[1:08:46] See, God harnesses trouble,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; put bits in his mouth, and makes it obey
[1:08:52] him. And those troubles bring us into a
[1:08:56] closer fellowship with God.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Troubles.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; When you're going through the trouble,
[1:09:04] you wake up in the morning, first thing
[1:09:06] you do is pray.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, but there's no trouble. First thing
[1:09:10] you do is make coffee.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; You make breakfast. You make the bed.
[1:09:19] I'll find time for God.
[1:09:21] Oh, but something about when you're
[1:09:23] going through troubles, God allows
[1:09:26] troubles to bring you into a closer
[1:09:29] fellowship. He said there had been no
[1:09:31] rainbow until the flood came.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; But notice after Noah went through the
[1:09:36] tribulation that he saw the covenant
[1:09:38] rainbow.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; And it's a lot of times, church, it's
[1:09:42] after the trial. It's after the
[1:09:44] affliction. Do we see the promise of God
[1:09:47] manifested in front of us?
[1:09:49] And he would tell us this. Oh, we ask
[1:09:51] for comfort and we ask for peace and God
[1:09:54] gives us the best that he could. He
[1:09:56] gives us trials and tribulations.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; I know ain't nobody tonight's going to
[1:10:01] ask for comfort. Nobody's asking for
[1:10:03] peace. Raise your hand. You want comfort
[1:10:05] and peace.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Oh mercy.
[1:10:10] Get ready for trials and tribulations.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Brother man say that's better than
[1:10:16] comfort and peace. Our comfort is just
[1:10:19] beyond the river.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; But we finding God's way here in 1952.
[1:10:25] He says, "When the children of Israel
[1:10:26] come out of the land of Egypt, they
[1:10:28] follow God's path."
[1:10:31] And it led up to the Red Sea strange
[1:10:34] that God will lead his path up that way
[1:10:37] because we think, "Hey, I'm a believer.
[1:10:39] I come out of the world, you know, this
[1:10:41] is going to be great. We're gonna follow
[1:10:43] God. I'm I'm a believer of this message
[1:10:45] by God. God sent a prophet. This is
[1:10:47] going to be a fairy land.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Well, you stay around much longer,
[1:10:53] you're going to be in for a rude
[1:10:54] awakening.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; You want comfort, you want peace, get
[1:10:59] ready for the trial, get ready for the
[1:11:01] affliction. But let me tell you, just
[1:11:03] beyond the trial, just beyond the the
[1:11:06] battle, just beyond the affliction,
[1:11:08] there's a promised land for you.
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:13] And we find here when they came out of
[1:11:15] Egypt, they followed God's path. It led
[1:11:18] to a Red Sea. And strange that God's
[1:11:20] path will lead that way, but his path
[1:11:22] went right through that sea.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; I can't believe, Brother Mark, you mean
[1:11:27] we're following Moses's message.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He must have got it wrong. He must have
[1:11:33] not heard from God.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He must not be a
[1:11:39] vindicated prophet. He must have not got
[1:11:42] that from the Lord. That must have been
[1:11:44] his own intuition.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; If he was any kind of prophet, he
[1:11:49] wouldn't have led us this way.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; If he was any kind of messenger, how in
[1:11:56] the world dare you, Moses, to take us to
[1:11:59] the Red Sea? We got mountains on both
[1:12:01] sides and the army's behind us. What are
[1:12:04] we going to do? And many times we find
[1:12:06] ourselves in that situation.
[1:12:09] But God's path led right through the Red
[1:12:13] Sea. And let me tell you, in your life,
[1:12:15] God is going to lead you through trials.
[1:12:17] God will lead you through afflictions.
[1:12:19] God will lead you through hard times.
[1:12:21] But it's God's path nevertheless.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; God's got a purpose for it. They needed
[1:12:27] to go through that sea.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So when it come time, all the shadows
[1:12:35] and Israel stood there before the sea.
[1:12:37] God's path led across the sea. So God
[1:12:40] looked down through the pillar of fire
[1:12:43] and the sea got scared and moved back
[1:12:45] and Israel went across on dry ground.
[1:12:48] See, God's path led through it.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; See, don't question where the path
[1:12:54] leads. Just follow.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; See, maybe your path tonight may be a
[1:13:00] wayward child. It may be a struggle in
[1:13:03] the home. Maybe it be a mom or a wife
[1:13:06] that's not serving the Lord. Maybe it's
[1:13:08] a spouse, a husband and a father not
[1:13:11] serving the Lord, but it's God's path.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; See, just keep trusting.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Just keep following the pillar of fire.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; See, God knows how to lead.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; See, he's proven, brother Rhonda, that
[1:13:27] not even cancer will stand before the
[1:13:29] believer's prayer.
[1:13:32] Well, if that's the case, then why is he
[1:13:34] not delivered? I'm going to tell you it
[1:13:36] is the case cuz he's still alive.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:13:44] You say, "I want to see a miracle. I
[1:13:46] want to see the supernatural." Well,
[1:13:48] feast your eyes on a miracle. Feast your
[1:13:51] eyes on the supernatural. It's God's
[1:13:53] leading.
[1:13:55] Not just for Ron Spencer, not just for
[1:13:57] the Spencer family, but God is declaring
[1:14:00] to this devil, to this end time
[1:14:02] generation, that I'm going to have a
[1:14:04] people. I'm going to have a bride. I'm
[1:14:06] going to lead them through affliction.
[1:14:07] I'm going to lead them through some hard
[1:14:09] times, even cancer. But inside of me,
[1:14:12] they will find me as a hiding place, as
[1:14:15] a comfort, as a protection.
[1:14:19] in this hour, in this age, God is
[1:14:22] determined
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; that nothing will destroy his bride.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Though he went, notice now they went
[1:14:34] right up to the wilderness. They leave
[1:14:36] the Red Sea and they go right into the
[1:14:39] spring of Mar. Bitter waters. My
[1:14:41] goodness,
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; man. Couldn't catch a break.
[1:14:49] Come on. Is that you,
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; man? Some of us come through the Red
[1:14:53] Sea. Wow. The walls are all built up,
[1:14:56] man. We rejoicing,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; man. We dancing. We had meetings just a
[1:15:01] few weeks ago. My God was good.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Soon as the meeting was over, you get on
[1:15:05] the other side. Walls, other waters came
[1:15:08] back in. God leads you straight to
[1:15:10] bitter waters. First thing you do is,
[1:15:12] "What did I do?
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Why me? If I didn't have bad luck, I
[1:15:19] wouldn't have no luck.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, Eeyore.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; That's some of we walk around with
[1:15:29] Eeyore complex.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Only way God knows me is I'm moaning and
[1:15:34] groaning.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; But notice, he leads him right after the
[1:15:39] Red Sea
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; and he takes them straight to Mara,
[1:15:44] bitter waters.
[1:15:46] Ain't it strange that God will lead his
[1:15:48] children through bitter waters?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I'm sure, brother Ron, that this five
[1:15:52] years has not been sweet.
[1:15:56] My I'm sure you didn't wake up and say,
[1:15:58] "God, come on. Pour it on. Let it happen
[1:16:01] a little bit more. Come on. I want to
[1:16:02] throw up again. Come on. I give me
[1:16:05] another dose of that that that that uh
[1:16:07] chemo pill or that chemo medicine." No,
[1:16:10] you're not asking for that. It's been
[1:16:11] bitter.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; It's been bitter waters. But every time
[1:16:16] he stands behind the desk,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; it's a testimony of a hiding place.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; And no matter what the enemy is allowed
[1:16:25] to do, he is only limited because we
[1:16:28] serve a limitless God tonight. And Satan
[1:16:31] has boundaries.
[1:16:33] And let me tell you, he can only go so
[1:16:35] far. But I'm going to tell you tonight,
[1:16:37] you can run to the hiding place. And the
[1:16:40] hells of hell, they can't get you. The
[1:16:42] pursuers, they can't touch you. You can
[1:16:45] run to that place tonight.
[1:16:50] Why does he get up here and preach on
[1:16:52] Sunday?
[1:16:55] Cuz there's a hiding place. He's found
[1:16:57] it. It's a sweet place. It's a wonderful
[1:17:00] presence.
[1:17:03] Well, they come to bitter waters and my
[1:17:05] seems like God, why'd you lead me here?
[1:17:10] But on the road,
[1:17:12] brother tell them, notice the bitter
[1:17:15] waters were standing. He said the remedy
[1:17:18] for the bitter waters were standing just
[1:17:20] on the other side of the bank.
[1:17:24] Moses got over there and he cut down a
[1:17:26] tree and he threw the tree in the water
[1:17:30] and the waters became sweet.
[1:17:34] And see just on the other side of your
[1:17:37] bitter waters is a tree of life.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Instead of moaning, instead of
[1:17:45] complaining, instead of groaning,
[1:17:47] instead of backbiting, instead of
[1:17:49] fussing about this, well, if I was the
[1:17:51] pastor,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; well, thank God you're not.
[1:18:00] Well, if I was a pastor, I'd do this and
[1:18:03] I'd do that and I' That's why God didn't
[1:18:05] choose you.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Well, if I was the assistant pastor,
[1:18:09] well, God didn't choose you for that
[1:18:10] role either.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; But notice what you need is to take the
[1:18:19] tree of life and put it in your bitter
[1:18:21] waters and let those bitter waters
[1:18:23] return sweet again. Well, you'll enjoy
[1:18:25] coming to the house of the Lord. You'll
[1:18:27] enjoy the presence of God. It won't be a
[1:18:30] struggle. It won't be a push. It won't
[1:18:32] be a hardship to come to the house of
[1:18:34] God. No. And you God can make those
[1:18:37] bitter waters sweet again
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; till you can't wait till the doors open.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Maybe tonight you're dealing with
[1:18:47] sickness. Maybe you've fallen on some
[1:18:49] hard times. Jesus is the tree of life.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is put Jesus. Put them
[1:18:57] in your boat tonight.
[1:19:00] Put them in those bitter waters. Let
[1:19:02] them turn sweet again. What a man would
[1:19:05] tell us. See, that's the way God leads
[1:19:07] his children. God's path, God's provided
[1:19:10] way. If the children of Israel would
[1:19:12] have tried to bypass and go around this
[1:19:16] way, they would have gotten into
[1:19:17] trouble.
[1:19:19] Notice they had to go to the Red Sea. If
[1:19:22] they tried to go around it, they'd have
[1:19:24] got in trouble. They had to come to
[1:19:26] bitter waters. If they would have tried
[1:19:27] to go around, they would have got in
[1:19:29] trouble. And we find today, church.
[1:19:33] Brother Bam said they had to follow the
[1:19:35] pillar of fire.
[1:19:39] They had to follow. And if they had to
[1:19:41] follow the pillar of fire, so do we have
[1:19:44] to follow the same pillar of fire.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; See, they had to follow a cloud of fire.
[1:19:48] Pillar of fire that led them. They
[1:19:50] followed that. And if the church tonight
[1:19:53] will only follow the pillar of fire, the
[1:19:56] Holy Spirit, you'll make Canaan as sure
[1:19:59] as anything. God has a way, a provided
[1:20:02] way. But we find men today,
[1:20:05] you know, they're following after a man.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have a headquarters now.
[1:20:14] I know we don't like to preach like
[1:20:15] this. They tell you when to listen to
[1:20:19] something.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. tell you how to listen to
[1:20:23] something. Somebody sent me a little
[1:20:24] picture today. It had a a little house
[1:20:27] and it it was in Spanish and it was a
[1:20:29] token. This is how you tell every tape
[1:20:31] home now has a little house with the
[1:20:33] token applied to it on the door. Let me
[1:20:36] tell you, we're not people that's done
[1:20:38] gone to relics and idol type things. No,
[1:20:42] our token is the Holy Ghost. Our token
[1:20:46] is still the blood. Our token, that's
[1:20:48] what we're going. That's what we're
[1:20:50] applying to the house today. That's what
[1:20:52] we're applying to the marriages today.
[1:20:55] We don't take some little trinket and
[1:20:56] put it on the door and say, "Bless God,
[1:20:58] we got the token."
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, you wake to hell,
[1:21:03] firefalls, and the bomb start dropping.
[1:21:05] That little cookie house is going to
[1:21:06] burn up.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; But if you got the token on the inside,
[1:21:10] if you found yourself in that hiding
[1:21:13] place when that first bomb fall, baby,
[1:21:15] we're going up.
[1:21:17] We're going to pass that thing goodbye.
[1:21:20] Why? Because we found a refuge. We found
[1:21:23] a secret place. We found a protection.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; B says, "Sometimes we think our burdens,
[1:21:39] he goes, I might interject here.
[1:21:40] Sometimes we think our burdens are just
[1:21:42] so heavy sometimes that there's nothing
[1:21:44] like it in the world.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Come on. Full gospel. Woo. Sometimes
[1:21:52] like, man, I need a friend to help me
[1:21:54] tote these things around.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's tough.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you these men.
[1:22:03] It looks all fabulous, doesn't it? Boy,
[1:22:06] standing behind the desk preaching.
[1:22:09] Everybody gets to look at them.
[1:22:15] Look at them.
[1:22:18] Ain't none of them saying, "Look at me."
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; No, but what you don't see is the
[1:22:25] struggles.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; What you don't see is the personal
[1:22:29] attacks.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; What you don't see is the affliction,
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; but what you see is a hiding place.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; You see, it's hidden them. They don't
[1:22:41] preach their affliction. They don't
[1:22:42] preach their troubles. They don't preach
[1:22:44] the things that they go through.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; They stand here to present Christ
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; and him crucified.
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; The other day, I'll just interject here
[1:23:03] and I come back to this quote. The other
[1:23:04] day, probably about a month ago, I had a
[1:23:06] dream. I had a snake come. I was
[1:23:08] sleeping, Brother Ron, and the snake
[1:23:10] bumped up beside me. Never saw the head.
[1:23:12] I just the body just bumped up beside
[1:23:15] me. And I was like, in my dream, I was
[1:23:18] like,
[1:23:19] you know, you ever
[1:23:25] in my same dream, it comes back the
[1:23:27] other direction, bumps me again.
[1:23:32] See, I was bumped twice in the last two
[1:23:35] years. I've been full-time ministry four
[1:23:37] years now. In the last two years, I've
[1:23:38] been bumped. I've been rubbed. I've been
[1:23:41] pushed. I've been tried.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; By things out there among our peers.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Things try to bump you and try to shake
[1:23:49] you. Satan will try to do those. Never
[1:23:51] saw the face. Never saw the head. Only
[1:23:53] just felt the body of it.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; See, we feel sometimes our burdens.
[1:24:01] Man, you want to just throw down the
[1:24:03] towel and say, "Forget this. If this is
[1:24:05] all that the message can produce, I
[1:24:07] don't want to preach it anymore.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Men of God struggling and fighting and
[1:24:12] bumping each other.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, but I'm tell you,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; when it's when you're not your own, when
[1:24:19] you've been bought with a price, as much
[1:24:21] as you try to walk away, as much as you
[1:24:22] try to quit, you can't quit.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; When you find that hiding place and he
[1:24:28] becomes a place of protection, you just
[1:24:30] look at it for what it is and keep your
[1:24:32] eyes on the goal.
[1:24:35] and keep pushing and keep pressing keep
[1:24:37] pressing to the mark of the high
[1:24:39] calling.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're going to we're we're
[1:24:43] being tried,
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; but that's the that's that's the hour in
[1:24:46] which we're living in.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You know, you're tried on a different
[1:24:49] level than what we're tried. But we
[1:24:51] find, brother Bam, nevertheless, is that
[1:24:52] we think our burdens are so heavy
[1:24:54] sometimes that nothing there's nothing
[1:24:56] like it in the world. Do you all know
[1:24:58] those things are good for you?
[1:25:02] Well, you got a wicked sense of humor.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; This ain't no fun. I didn't sign up for
[1:25:08] this. None of us did.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; See, they're all to mold you and to make
[1:25:13] you prophets and sages. They were molded
[1:25:16] on the backside of the desert in the hot
[1:25:18] blazing sun through tribulations and
[1:25:21] trials and persecutions. And these
[1:25:23] things that we have today, there's
[1:25:26] nothing happened to us that hasn't
[1:25:28] happened to other Christians before.
[1:25:30] other Christians has had to stand in
[1:25:32] their hour of darkness like this and
[1:25:34] even be fed to lines for their
[1:25:36] testimony, but they stood their test.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; And can I tell you somebody, God is
[1:25:42] going to have a bride in this hour and
[1:25:45] she will stand her test.
[1:25:49] Let me tell you, Satan, in the name of
[1:25:52] the Lord this evening, you don't have
[1:25:53] enough to keep this bride down. You
[1:25:56] don't have enough to stop her. We will
[1:25:59] take a rapture. We will take a body
[1:26:01] change. Why? Because we have entered
[1:26:03] into a hiding place.
[1:26:08] And it ain't the church. And it ain't
[1:26:10] some man. And it ain't some gift. It's
[1:26:12] the word of God.
[1:26:16] That's our secret place.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; So he knows how to mold you. He knows
[1:26:24] the kind of material that he's going to
[1:26:25] use.
[1:26:27] See, all of us are different. I had a
[1:26:30] brother asked me the other day. I was in
[1:26:32] Mexico.
[1:26:34] He said, "Does, does all the other
[1:26:36] brothers in your church preach like
[1:26:37] you?" I'm like, "No, I'm the only one."
[1:26:41] I was like, "What you mean?" I mean,
[1:26:43] like you all.
[1:26:48] Now, this is being interpreted through
[1:26:50] Spanish.
[1:26:52] Does all of them get like you just
[1:26:58] No, I'm probably the most out of all of
[1:27:01] them.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; But see, God put certain material in us,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; certain gifts in us.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; See, we ting a little bit different.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; I'm like a little Chihuahua.
[1:27:17] Let me tell you, I saw authenticated
[1:27:19] Chihuahua in Mexico last week.
[1:27:22] authenticated. About that tall, long,
[1:27:24] about that tall, running through a
[1:27:26] little road.
[1:27:30] All right, bro. Don't you bite that
[1:27:31] tire. You going to flip around.
[1:27:36] But you know, little Chihuahua, look,
[1:27:38] he's got everything in the world to
[1:27:39] prove.
[1:27:43] And God knows how to place little
[1:27:45] Chihuahua in the church.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; They keep it lively. They keep the amens
[1:27:52] coming. They keep the hallelujah
[1:27:54] rolling. A little to
[1:27:59] hallelujah.
[1:28:00] Glory.
[1:28:04] Get some emotion in the church. Get some
[1:28:06] excitement in the house of God.
[1:28:09] Expect the impossible. Expect the
[1:28:12] supernatural.
[1:28:15] Don't tell a little Chihuahua to shut
[1:28:16] up.
[1:28:22] He'll say amen a little bit longer and a
[1:28:24] little bit louder and he won't sit down
[1:28:27] and he'll keep pulling and he'll keep
[1:28:29] preaching and he'll keep shouting and
[1:28:31] he'll keep Oh hallelujah church
[1:28:39] but God puts things in us
[1:28:42] certain things.
[1:28:44] Now as much as I want to be like
[1:28:47] Mr. politician over here.
[1:28:52] We call brother Ron. He's the politician
[1:28:54] of the ministry. I mean, look, we went
[1:28:58] to lunch today. Brother Andrew, I almost
[1:29:00] did it. I almost put my suit on,
[1:29:08] man. I'm going I'm going to have lunch
[1:29:10] with the president.
[1:29:13] Ronald Dean, the man was in a
[1:29:16] three-piece suit at lunch.
[1:29:21] We went to his house.
[1:29:25] It wasn't like we went to town.
[1:29:30] But not everybody can be a Ronald Dean.
[1:29:33] Not everybody can be an Andrew or a Mark
[1:29:35] or a Matt or not everybody can be a Jo
[1:29:38] and not everybody can be you.
[1:29:41] But realize God placed something in you
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; that your neighbor needs, that this
[1:29:46] church needs, that this ministry needs.
[1:29:49] God plays something in you. And only you
[1:29:51] can team. Only you can sound. Only you
[1:29:54] can write down with the same. Amen.
[1:29:57] Church.
[1:30:00] But God knows what it takes to mold you.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; And he puts things in us. See, he knows
[1:30:05] how to mold you. the material that he's
[1:30:08] going to use on the back side of the
[1:30:10] desert sometimes.
[1:30:12] When you feel like you ain't got a
[1:30:13] friend, when you feel like you're all
[1:30:15] alone, when you feel like maybe you
[1:30:17] didn't come from a a family of
[1:30:19] preachers, but you got to know when God
[1:30:21] called you.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; That you ain't called by a man, you're
[1:30:25] called by him.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; See, the battle so does God's mold. He
[1:30:30] says, "Now sometimes where God mows
[1:30:32] righteous men into sages and prophets is
[1:30:36] on the back side of a desert." It's not
[1:30:38] through the flowery bed of ease of the
[1:30:40] great supernatural services that they
[1:30:42] have and there's an outpouring of the
[1:30:44] Holy Spirit and the supernatural falls
[1:30:46] and people are being healed and
[1:30:48] delivered and set free and slain in the
[1:30:49] spirit. It's not during those times. Oh,
[1:30:52] it's in that prayer closet when they've
[1:30:54] been bumping
[1:30:56] with the enemy. They've been rubbing
[1:30:58] shoulders and things are coming and they
[1:31:00] keep they keep the course. They stay
[1:31:02] steady. Notice
[1:31:05] he said that's where men are beat out.
[1:31:08] Men are beat out in in the word. He says
[1:31:10] when when they got all this kind of
[1:31:12] creed and stuff in them, let them come
[1:31:14] to the word and God beats it right out
[1:31:16] of them. Modes it right into this into
[1:31:19] the great symphony with his word.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So God is a conductor.
[1:31:26] Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; He's a conductor and and brother would
[1:31:30] tell us and I'm going to kind of go down
[1:31:31] this line for a minute. He said he knows
[1:31:33] when the rhythm of it has to change.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; For 20some years I was doing my own
[1:31:41] thing. 20some years I didn't grow up in
[1:31:44] a Christian home. I didn't grow up in
[1:31:45] the me I didn't know anything about it.
[1:31:47] I was doing what I did. And but God knew
[1:31:50] when the music needed to change. God
[1:31:52] knew when the rhythm of my life needed
[1:31:55] to change. And God knows when the rhythm
[1:31:57] of your life needs to change. And so
[1:32:00] what does God do? God will pull the rug
[1:32:02] out from underneath you to get you in
[1:32:05] sync with the word.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; See, he knows. He He knows how it goes.
[1:32:13] I don't. But I look to here and he says
[1:32:15] it just keeps coming. See, God allows us
[1:32:17] to go through things in order for the
[1:32:20] rhythm of our lives. to get in sync with
[1:32:22] the word.
[1:32:24] So, there's times where we begin to
[1:32:26] think we can do it on our own.
[1:32:28] Some men get elevated. They get lifted
[1:32:31] up and they think, "Well,
[1:32:34] I'm a great somebody." And they now they
[1:32:36] have little satellite groups.
[1:32:40] But God knows how to change the
[1:32:42] symphony, the rhythm of the music, the
[1:32:45] rhythm of the word. And maybe we start
[1:32:47] seeing things different in the word,
[1:32:48] misplacing things. Then God knows how to
[1:32:51] change the rhythm to get you back in
[1:32:53] sync and say what only what a prophet
[1:32:55] says.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; So he knows how to do that. He says,
[1:32:59] "Now many are the afflictions of the
[1:33:00] righteous, but God deliverth him out of
[1:33:03] them all." See, God has moved through
[1:33:05] history with the rhythm of the promise
[1:33:07] of his word.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Notice the rhythm of the promise of his
[1:33:11] word in each age and in the same rhythm
[1:33:14] making his word. That's how God moved
[1:33:16] down through history from all the way
[1:33:18] from Genesis to Revelation. He has moved
[1:33:21] through history with the word. That's
[1:33:23] right. With the rhythm of the power of
[1:33:25] the Holy Spirit, vindicating his word to
[1:33:28] the elect.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And it's no different today.
[1:33:34] The rhythm. Your pastor preached a
[1:33:36] message many years ago.
[1:33:39] It'll never change. But the music,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; the ne the hurt or the affliction will
[1:33:48] never stop the music.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Because the rhythm, God knows the rhythm
[1:33:52] of it. He knows how it flows. He knows
[1:33:55] how to mold you. And see, the Hebrew
[1:33:57] children, they were forced into a fiery
[1:33:59] furnace. But see, God began to change
[1:34:02] the rhythm of the music because he was
[1:34:04] going to have three young boys that
[1:34:06] refused to bow.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. in Babylon without mom,
[1:34:10] without dad, without preacher, without
[1:34:12] pastor, without a prophet.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Or they had a prophet and they erected a
[1:34:16] big old statue to him, but they refused
[1:34:18] to bow down to it.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; And we find, notice, then we find Daniel
[1:34:22] here. Daniel had purposed in his heart.
[1:34:25] When the law was levied against him, you
[1:34:27] go and pray, you're going to be thrown
[1:34:28] into a den of lions. Daniel didn't run
[1:34:30] to the next country. Daniel didn't run
[1:34:32] to the next house. He didn't run to the
[1:34:34] next church. He went home, opened the
[1:34:36] curtains, and began to pray like he's
[1:34:38] always done.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; See, because that's what was in Daniel.
[1:34:42] Daniel to purpose in his heart that he
[1:34:43] would not defile himself. And notice,
[1:34:46] after the test,
[1:34:49] did the angel of the Lord appear
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; in his den of lions.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; After the test did the fourth man appear
[1:34:57] in the fiery furnace. Think about
[1:34:59] Abraham here. Lot chose the better land
[1:35:01] of Sodom. And Abraham's on the back side
[1:35:03] of the desert. Everybody's complaining,
[1:35:05] moaning, groaning. It's hot.
[1:35:07] Everything's dried up. And Abraham had
[1:35:09] to make a decision. I'm going to stay
[1:35:11] exactly where God told me to stay.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not church hopping. I'm not going
[1:35:16] looking for a better this and or better
[1:35:18] that. I'm going to stay exactly where
[1:35:20] the Lord planned me. I'm not going to
[1:35:21] keep looking. I'm going to stay right
[1:35:23] here. And what did what did Abraham find
[1:35:26] after the test that Abraham went
[1:35:28] through? Then Elohim showed up.
[1:35:31] Let me tell you, after the test, he met
[1:35:33] the He met God Almighty, church. It's
[1:35:36] after the test.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; So, let me just give you a word of
[1:35:40] encouragement tonight. Don't look at
[1:35:42] your trial. Look at the promise after
[1:35:45] the trial.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; See, we're not immune from trials. We're
[1:35:51] not immune from difficult seasons. And
[1:35:53] but David reminds us no matter where you
[1:35:57] find yourself that he's our hiding
[1:35:59] place.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; He's our high tower. He's our refuge.
[1:36:04] He's our rock in a weary land. But it's
[1:36:07] after the trial, after you overcome that
[1:36:09] the Lord draws nigh. Brother Ron, I was
[1:36:12] watching Brother Wayne preach Sunday
[1:36:14] morning of your meetings. It was a few
[1:36:17] days after the service was over and I
[1:36:19] was home by myself. the family was gone
[1:36:21] and I was listening and and I'd been
[1:36:24] like I said I've been bumped. I've been
[1:36:25] going through some things. Brother
[1:36:26] Andrew and I you we talked about some of
[1:36:27] these things that I've been going
[1:36:29] through back when we were together a few
[1:36:30] months ago and you know sometimes these
[1:36:32] things are not quickly you don't quickly
[1:36:34] get over them. But I was sitting there
[1:36:36] and I was listening to brother Wayne
[1:36:38] minister and begin to talk about the
[1:36:40] angel of the Lord and how would we begin
[1:36:42] to draw near and and I just begin to
[1:36:44] just I could feel the presence of the
[1:36:46] angel draw in and I can feel him just
[1:36:48] push out. Tears begin to well then he
[1:36:51] just kind of come and then kind of go.
[1:36:53] But at certain point during the
[1:36:54] preaching of the the message the angel
[1:36:57] Lord just drew near and I just lay put
[1:36:59] my hands up again to weep to God. Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; See, it's after the trial.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; It's after How are you going to respond?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; How are you going to respond?
[1:37:16] Do you dig in, Chihuahua? Do you dig in
[1:37:18] or do you throw your hands up?
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; See, you throw your hands up because the
[1:37:24] presence of the Lord drew near and I
[1:37:26] just wept like a baby in my living room.
[1:37:29] Just cried out to God, thanking God,
[1:37:30] Lord, thank you. And now it's over. Now
[1:37:33] it's over. Now we can move on.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; And see, it's after the test that he
[1:37:38] shows up.
[1:37:40] And you maybe you feel that warm
[1:37:42] presence. Maybe you feel him draw nigh.
[1:37:44] Even now you draw nigh to your
[1:37:46] situation. And maybe tears may try to
[1:37:49] well up or maybe it's a shout that wells
[1:37:51] up. But notice it was after the battle
[1:37:55] Melzdc
[1:37:57] appeared to Abraham.
[1:37:59] A lot of times, church, it's not during
[1:38:01] the battle. It's not during the test.
[1:38:04] It's not during the affliction. It's
[1:38:06] always after.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; But David says, "Thou art my hiding
[1:38:14] place."
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Can I go a little further tonight?
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Thou art my hiding place. This is an
[1:38:24] illusion to the cities of refuge. And
[1:38:28] Moses, God told Moses, "Moses, when you
[1:38:30] get over into the land of Canaan, I want
[1:38:32] you to erect these cities of refuge."
[1:38:35] And that if any man had done anything by
[1:38:38] mistake and he killed somebody, because
[1:38:40] in that day it was eye for an eye and
[1:38:42] tooth for a tooth and you know, thank
[1:38:44] God we don't live in that day.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; man. We'd pull our 357s out. Boom. Got
[1:38:48] you.
[1:38:50] Yeah. Come in my church. Do that again.
[1:38:53] No, this ain't the hood, people.
[1:38:58] Thank God we wasn't hoods in that day.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; But it was eye for an eye, tooth for a
[1:39:04] tooth. And you know, but if if that
[1:39:06] person, they knew that they did it and
[1:39:08] they did it accidentally. If they could
[1:39:10] get to that city of refuge, if they
[1:39:13] could get to that hiding place and the
[1:39:15] doors shut behind them, they knew then
[1:39:18] that no matter how many pursuers was on
[1:39:20] their trail, they couldn't come inside
[1:39:22] there that the pursuer couldn't get to
[1:39:24] them. And what am I telling you tonight?
[1:39:26] Let me tell you, the same word applied
[1:39:29] to them is the same word that applies to
[1:39:31] us tonight. If you did it by mistake,
[1:39:34] you didn't want to do it and you ran to
[1:39:36] that house of refuge, that hiding place.
[1:39:38] Let me tell you, you're safe tonight.
[1:39:40] That devil can't get you. The hands of
[1:39:42] hell can't get you. Sickness can't get
[1:39:45] you. Let me Oh, come on, somebody. Safe
[1:39:48] don't have enough to get you. He can
[1:39:50] only look over.
[1:39:52] I said, "He can only pierce over, but he
[1:39:55] can't come in." I said, "Oh, glory to
[1:39:57] God. Tonight, you can only peek through
[1:39:58] the door, but you can't come in, devil.
[1:40:02] I'm in a house of refuge. I'm in a city.
[1:40:05] I'm in a dwelling place. I'm in a
[1:40:07] protection."
[1:40:10] They could not enter into that city.
[1:40:14] But notice, he said he had to know that
[1:40:17] he had a need of it. See, you got to
[1:40:20] know that you have a need of that city.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; If you lolly guy around, pursuer is
[1:40:27] going to get you.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Or he says, you must want to stay there.
[1:40:34] No complaining.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; I'm sure as a pastor, you never hear
[1:40:39] that, do you?
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; No complaining, pastors.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; No complaining.
[1:40:50] See, brother B tell us he says now he
[1:40:53] must want to stay there. No complaining.
[1:40:56] Walk around say oh why did I ever come
[1:40:58] in here?
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Why did I ever show up at full gospel
[1:41:03] lighthouse
[1:41:06] just Ron Spencer and Andrew Spencer and
[1:41:09] Matt Spencer. I ain't got no more
[1:41:10] preachers in the Spencers.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That's how carnal we get sometimes. Oh,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; you know, I'm just saying what you're
[1:41:20] thinking.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, that's just the way
[1:41:29] people does today. They say they want to
[1:41:31] be free from the cares of the world.
[1:41:32] Then they get into it amongst the
[1:41:34] believers. They say, "Oh, I got to give
[1:41:35] up this and I got to give up that. I got
[1:41:37] to pay tithe.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; I got to take the makeup off. I got to
[1:41:43] quit cutting my hair. I got to quit
[1:41:45] wearing skinny jeans.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:41:51] he says, "But you got to know that you
[1:41:54] need to stay there. You can't come in
[1:41:55] that house of refuge and start
[1:41:57] complaining." He said, "They'll put you
[1:41:59] out
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; and you have to shift again for
[1:42:03] yourself, but you got to know that you
[1:42:05] got a need and you want to be there."
[1:42:07] And brother says, "When I came," he
[1:42:08] said, "Oh, it's just like heaven to me.
[1:42:10] When I come to this message, when I come
[1:42:13] to the gospel, when I gave my heart to
[1:42:15] God, I'm sitting in heavenly places.
[1:42:17] Church, let me tell you, I've been
[1:42:18] serving the Lord for 25, 26 years, and
[1:42:21] I've never had a desire to go back into
[1:42:24] the world.
[1:42:26] I never had a desire to smoke another
[1:42:28] cigarette, to drink another beer, to go
[1:42:31] out into a bar, to live a truth to my
[1:42:33] wife. Why? I found a city. I found a
[1:42:36] hiding place. I found the word. I found
[1:42:39] the gospel. I found God
[1:42:44] and he can change your desires.
[1:42:48] [Music]
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Says, "My only complaint
[1:42:59] is I didn't come when I was younger."
[1:43:01] Amen.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; See, we have a kingdom church
[1:43:08] that can't be moved.
[1:43:11] He says each nation is shaken. Skies are
[1:43:14] trembling. All nature is crying out. The
[1:43:18] world itself is trembling
[1:43:20] because it could be blowed to bits. But
[1:43:23] we have a kingdom that cannot be moved.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; We have a city of refuge. We have a go
[1:43:32] where the sun will never go down. He
[1:43:34] said, "Let us come to that rock now."
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; See, and inside that tower, I don't have
[1:43:44] no more desires, even a lookout.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; So, I didn't grow up in a Christian
[1:43:50] home. I didn't have somebody to model
[1:43:53] what it meant to be a Christian father,
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; to be a husband.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; But when you get that Holy Ghost, Amen.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; It'll mold you.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; It shapes you, brother Chris. It changes
[1:44:06] you. See, you don't have those desires
[1:44:08] that you used to have. It was that well,
[1:44:12] what's the what's the assurance of the
[1:44:14] Holy Ghost? Speaking in tongues. No,
[1:44:18] that's not the assurance or the evidence
[1:44:20] of the Holy Ghost. But the evidence of
[1:44:22] the Holy Ghost is your life changed. Has
[1:44:25] your desires been changed? Are you still
[1:44:28] wanting to peek outside that seat and go
[1:44:30] run around do the same things you used
[1:44:31] to do? You don't have it.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; But if you come into that hiding place,
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; where the things of the world are are
[1:44:39] sealed out and you're sealed in is you
[1:44:41] and God and you and God and there's a
[1:44:43] flowing from the presence of the
[1:44:44] almighty God. And he comes in and he
[1:44:46] visits you and you weep and you cry and
[1:44:49] you're in his presence. That's the
[1:44:50] assurance.
[1:44:54] Notice in this hiding place if you get
[1:44:56] sick there's healing
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; maybe you get weary brother says cast
[1:45:02] your cares upon him
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; because he cares for you see now think
[1:45:08] about Martha and Mary here their brother
[1:45:10] was four days dead skin worms begin to
[1:45:14] crawl through his body and no doubt he
[1:45:16] be to rotten and decay
[1:45:19] but when Martha came to him even now
[1:45:21] Lord Lord,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God,
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask God, I know he'll do
[1:45:27] it.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I know my brother will rise in the
[1:45:30] resurrection. He said, I am the
[1:45:32] resurrection.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; I am to life. Whatever you ask God. And
[1:45:37] church, sometimes it's time for you to
[1:45:39] start asking God.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Put it all on the ministry. It's
[1:45:42] not all on the ministry. It's on what
[1:45:44] you have need of tonight.
[1:45:48] So, thou art my hiding place. We're
[1:45:52] going to kind of turn it here.
[1:45:55] I got about 30 minutes. Is that okay?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Notice David here in Psalms
[1:46:02] 32. He says, "Thou art my."
[1:46:08] So, he makes a personal claim
[1:46:12] on it.
[1:46:14] Thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt
[1:46:17] preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt
[1:46:21] compass me about with songs of
[1:46:24] deliverance.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we want to put it on
[1:46:27] somebody else. We want to put it on mom
[1:46:30] or dad or deacon or preacher and you
[1:46:33] know camp meetings and things of that
[1:46:34] nature. But David is crying out thou
[1:46:37] God, you're mine.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; You're mine. Let me tell you church,
[1:46:41] it's got to be personal. It's got to be
[1:46:43] a relationship, not an exercise.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Got to have a relationship with him, not
[1:46:52] just an exercise. And we find here that
[1:46:55] the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 4:7
[1:46:57] that we're we have this treasure in
[1:46:59] earth and vessels that the excellent of
[1:47:01] the power of God be of God and not of
[1:47:04] us. We're troubled on every side, yet
[1:47:05] we're not distressed. We're perplexed,
[1:47:07] but we're not in despair. We're
[1:47:08] persecuted, but we're not forsaken.
[1:47:10] We're cast down, but we're not
[1:47:12] destroyed. Notice though we're troubled,
[1:47:14] church, and we're troubled on every
[1:47:15] side. We have a protection. We're we're
[1:47:18] not distressed. Though we're perplexed
[1:47:20] and we don't know which way to go, we're
[1:47:22] still not in despair. Though we feel the
[1:47:24] persecutions of the enemy, Jesus says,
[1:47:26] "I've not forsaken you. I'll not abandon
[1:47:28] you." Even when we've been cast down and
[1:47:30] and and and destroyed by the enemy, he
[1:47:33] says we're not destroyed, church. Let me
[1:47:35] tell you, no matter what befalls us,
[1:47:37] Jesus is our shield. He is our buckler.
[1:47:40] He is our high tower. He is our strong
[1:47:42] tower. He is our hiding place. And we as
[1:47:45] a believer, we can sing songs of triumph
[1:47:48] no matter where we find oursel. If we're
[1:47:50] in a prison cell like Paul and Silas, we
[1:47:53] can begin to worship God and the prison
[1:47:55] cells can fall open. Why? Because we
[1:47:58] have the assurance tonight.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; We have the assurance that nothing can
[1:48:04] destroy us.
[1:48:06] Notice
[1:48:08] Paul and Silas didn't let their troubles
[1:48:10] dictate their worship.
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Their prison walls didn't hinder their
[1:48:16] praise.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; They wasn't overcome by sorrows,
[1:48:20] depression, and questioning why me? What
[1:48:22] did I do to deserve this? They didn't
[1:48:24] allow their circumstances to rob them of
[1:48:26] an opportunity
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; for a good church service.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] See,
[1:48:35] in the midst of their trials, how many
[1:48:37] of you in a trial, in the midst of their
[1:48:41] trial,
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; they begin to worship.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; You know what true worship is?
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; It's a sacrifice.
[1:48:53] when you don't feel it,
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; when you don't even want to be here,
[1:48:59] when you drug yourself,
[1:49:02] but when you got here, you make a
[1:49:05] sacrifice
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; and you just start worshiping. Well, it
[1:49:08] may be routine.
[1:49:15] Come on.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, but all of a sudden,
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden, the rhythm of the music
[1:49:24] changes.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; The rhythm changes. The beat drops. Oo.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean?
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Like that song that was sung,
[1:49:40] don't forget where we're going. Amen.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Don't forget where we're going, man.
[1:49:45] Something begins to change the
[1:49:46] atmosphere
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; where you was all crabby spirit walking
[1:49:50] in. Now you just start tapping that foot
[1:49:53] a little bit.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; That hand, you don't have to push it up.
[1:49:56] It just goes up.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; See what happens. Stuff then begins to
[1:50:00] change cuz the rhythm of the music
[1:50:02] begins to change because the Holy Ghost
[1:50:05] begins to move through the aisles,
[1:50:06] begins to move through the pews because
[1:50:08] God knows what you have need of. And
[1:50:10] he's coming to you tonight for your
[1:50:12] need. And the Bible says the Lord shall
[1:50:14] preserve thee from all evil. He said he
[1:50:17] will shall preserve thy going in and thy
[1:50:20] going out. I'm here to tell you full
[1:50:22] gospel lighthouse. The devil has nothing
[1:50:24] against you tonight because you got a
[1:50:27] word that's already been spoke over you.
[1:50:29] God's going to bless your coming in.
[1:50:31] God's going to bless your going out. We
[1:50:33] are the head and not the tail. We are
[1:50:35] going up and not down.
[1:50:38] We are the prize. We are the elect lady.
[1:50:42] We are the predestinated sons and
[1:50:44] daughters of God.
[1:50:46] And we have found a refuge.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27. We're very familiar with
[1:50:55] this.
[1:50:59] I'm not going to hold you much longer.
[1:51:01] We're going to parachute out of here
[1:51:02] shortly.
[1:51:04] Psalms 27:1.
[1:51:06] The Lord.
[1:51:08] Oh, he's my gloom.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; No, the Bible says, "The Lord is my
[1:51:14] light.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; He's my illumination. He's my joy and my
[1:51:19] salvation. Whom shall I fear?
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Don't let this be David's cry. Let it be
[1:51:31] your cry.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my light.
[1:51:36] My illumination, my joy.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all need to tell your face.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; I got the joy, joy, joy down in my
[1:51:47] heart. Down in my heart.
[1:51:52] See, the Lord is my illumination, my
[1:51:54] joy, my salvation. Whom shall I fear?
[1:51:58] The Lord is the strength, safety,
[1:52:01] protection,
[1:52:03] refuge, stronghold
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; of my life.
[1:52:08] Whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked,
[1:52:11] even my enemies and my foes came upon me
[1:52:13] to eat of my flesh. They stumbled
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; and they fell.
[1:52:18] Though a hoe shall encamp against me, my
[1:52:21] heart shall not fear. Though war shall
[1:52:24] rise against me, in this will I be
[1:52:27] confident. One thing have I desired of
[1:52:30] the Lord.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. That's all you need tonight.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; One thing have I desired of the Lord
[1:52:37] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[1:52:40] in habit that I may notice abide in the
[1:52:43] house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:52:45] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:52:47] and to inquire in his temple. For in the
[1:52:50] time of trouble,
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; he didn't say in the good times. He
[1:52:54] didn't say when you're on a mountaintop.
[1:52:56] He said in a time of trouble. Let me
[1:52:59] take that's this day. That's this time.
[1:53:02] And we are sons and daughters of God. We
[1:53:04] are in a troubled condition. But in the
[1:53:07] time of trouble, he shall hide me.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; He shall protect me. He shall shield me.
[1:53:14] He shall put me in a secret place. In
[1:53:16] the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:53:18] hide me, and he shall set me upon a
[1:53:22] rock.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; In a time of trouble, unpleasant,
[1:53:31] giving of pain, unhappiness, misery, he
[1:53:35] shall hide me. He shall cover me over.
[1:53:41] See, notice
[1:53:44] he's going to cover me over, brother
[1:53:46] Ron, in his pavilion.
[1:53:49] That's his chamber. Give reference to a
[1:53:52] bed chamber.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Not the kitchen,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; not the living room, but that bed
[1:53:59] chamber
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; where it's a relationship,
[1:54:03] intimacy, where he whispers secrets to
[1:54:07] his wife. Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Notice now then he says in the secret of
[1:54:13] his tabernacle, his hiding place and he
[1:54:15] going to set me upon a rock
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; a revelation.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon, we understand that
[1:54:22] he would take this passage and he would
[1:54:24] begin to preach the rapture message.
[1:54:27] And what was he showing to the believer?
[1:54:29] That if you get this revelation,
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; you get the revelation of who you are.
[1:54:38] Let me tell you, young person, mom, dad,
[1:54:40] oh, blind, crazy, if you're
[1:54:42] here tonight, the greatest revelation
[1:54:45] that you can get is that you are a son
[1:54:48] and daughter of God.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Well, I want to know the mysteries.
[1:54:53] That's the greatest one. I want to know
[1:54:56] the opening of the seals. I want to know
[1:54:58] all that. Those are great things.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; But you got to understand who you are.
[1:55:06] And in the time of trouble, in the time
[1:55:10] when things ain't going your way, you
[1:55:12] got to know that you got a revelation
[1:55:14] that I come from God. I'm going back to
[1:55:17] God. No matter what I face on this side,
[1:55:20] hell don't have enough. The devil don't
[1:55:22] have enough. I am going to make it
[1:55:24] because why? Because he's already saw
[1:55:26] me. I got a revelation. I've been
[1:55:28] planted on a rock. I go into a secret
[1:55:30] place, a pavilion, a tabernacle in the
[1:55:34] presence of Almighty God. And can't no
[1:55:36] devil, can't no cancer, can't no
[1:55:38] sickness keep me from my hiding place.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. That's where we're
[1:55:45] going.
[1:55:52] A revelation.
[1:55:54] What is the new birth? It's the
[1:55:57] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:56:01] you. Not that you join the church.
[1:56:05] Let me tell you, join Full Gospel
[1:56:07] Lighthouse. Join Evening of Light
[1:56:08] Tabernacle. Pick your choice. We got 35
[1:56:11] of them around the message.
[1:56:15] There's a bunch of them. It It's not
[1:56:17] that.
[1:56:19] Notice the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:56:24] personally to you.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Not you join the church.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Not that you shook hands. You done
[1:56:32] something different. You said a creed.
[1:56:34] You promise to live by a code of rules.
[1:56:36] But Christ, the Bible, he is the word
[1:56:38] that is revealed to you. No matter what
[1:56:40] anybody else says, what takes place,
[1:56:42] it's Christ, pastor, priest, whatever it
[1:56:44] might be, it's Christ in you. That is a
[1:56:47] revelation that the church is built
[1:56:49] upon.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; See, the true revelation of Jesus
[1:56:54] Christ,
[1:56:56] when you got that in your heart, nothing
[1:56:58] will keep you from a rapture
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; because you are the rapture.
[1:57:04] See what a hiding place when fear comes,
[1:57:08] when depression comes, when anxieties
[1:57:11] comes, when guilt shows itself, when
[1:57:14] past mistakes and memories flare up,
[1:57:17] when war rises against you. One thing,
[1:57:22] I'm hidden in God through Christ.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; I found an abiding place, a hiding
[1:57:28] place. And brother Bram said, "Now the
[1:57:30] message calls the bride together."
[1:57:34] See, it's the message. That's what our
[1:57:35] hiding place is. And I'm going to turn a
[1:57:37] corner quickly and we're going to bring
[1:57:38] this to a close. But he says, "Notice
[1:57:41] the hiding place." He would tell us
[1:57:43] standing there married to the virtuous
[1:57:45] son of God. Never sinned in the first
[1:57:46] place. She was for ordained. She was
[1:57:48] trapped into it. And now when she heard
[1:57:50] the truth come forth, the blood cleansed
[1:57:52] her and she stands there virtuous. No
[1:57:54] sin at all on her. Why? Therefore, the
[1:57:57] message calls the bride together. See
[1:58:00] the shout. And so God sent a message to
[1:58:03] call you out of the world,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; call you out of sin, call you out of
[1:58:07] unbelief, call you to a secret place, a
[1:58:10] hiding place to set you behind the
[1:58:12] protection of his word.
[1:58:16] And then Jehovah Gyra number three, he
[1:58:18] said they marched out, talking of
[1:58:20] Israel, they marched out of Egypt on the
[1:58:23] strength of the testimony and the
[1:58:24] prophet with the pillar of fire over
[1:58:26] them because he was sent. Notice now and
[1:58:30] God proved that he was with them. They
[1:58:32] marched out on the testimony of a
[1:58:35] prophet.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to go somewhere. But that
[1:58:40] same group that marched out, only two
[1:58:43] marched in.
[1:58:48] They marched out. Two million strong
[1:58:50] marched out under the testimony of God
[1:58:53] sent a prophet.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; But only two.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Come on. Only two went in.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let me just preach this for a
[1:59:02] minute now. He says, "Now Moses called a
[1:59:04] nation out of a nation. The Holy Spirit
[1:59:07] is calling a bride out of a church. A
[1:59:09] church out of a church. Members from
[1:59:11] every denomination making up the bride."
[1:59:13] Here he said the bride coming out.
[1:59:16] That's the one, the bride rather. She's
[1:59:18] the one that's going to be in the
[1:59:19] rapture. That alone nothing but the
[1:59:21] bride, the elected one fornown of God
[1:59:24] from the beginning. The father's
[1:59:26] spiritual gene. And he's calling out an
[1:59:28] end time bride. He called you from dark
[1:59:30] denominationalism. He called some of you
[1:59:33] out of the Amish life, out of the Menite
[1:59:35] life, some of you out of the bars, some
[1:59:37] of you out of the prostitute life. He
[1:59:39] called you what? He didn't just call you
[1:59:41] out, but he called you out to take you
[1:59:43] somewhere.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; We called out on this hour. God's got a
[1:59:47] desire to take you. Oh, hallelujah,
[1:59:51] somebody.
[1:59:53] He's got a desire to take you to the
[1:59:56] land.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; He said the three stages of the journey.
[2:00:02] They left Egypt under justification.
[2:00:04] Believe in the word. They separated
[2:00:06] themselves from the Egyptians and come
[2:00:08] out. They crossed the Red Sea, killed
[2:00:10] the things that were behind them, which
[2:00:12] was sanctification through the blood
[2:00:13] that kills all all human desires of
[2:00:16] evil. The second stage of the journey.
[2:00:18] But the third stage
[2:00:20] was when they crossed into Jordan
[2:00:24] into the promised land where their
[2:00:26] inheritance laid. See, their inheritance
[2:00:30] never laid in Egypt.
[2:00:34] So don't be content, church, with just
[2:00:36] coming out.
[2:00:42] Well, I believe God sent a prophet.
[2:00:44] There's more to it than that.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I've been through the Red Sea. I'm
[2:00:53] living a sanctified life. There's more
[2:00:55] to this message than that. Come on.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; See the third stage, brother Ron.
[2:01:04] The there's a land promise to the end
[2:01:07] time believer.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; There is a promise of the baptism of the
[2:01:12] Holy Ghost to the end time believer.
[2:01:15] Brother talked here in paradise. He said
[2:01:17] it was about 3:00 in the morning, I
[2:01:18] suppose, and I I'd got up and I looked
[2:01:20] where and in front of me I was it was
[2:01:22] coming down to Jordan. And I looked like
[2:01:23] I was standing on the map of Palestine.
[2:01:26] And I was coming down to Jordan. It
[2:01:28] seemed like I could hear the song, I'm
[2:01:29] coming down to Jordan. Someone was
[2:01:32] singing it. And as I drew near near the
[2:01:34] river, I looked back and I seen which
[2:01:36] way had come. And I was twothird of the
[2:01:38] way to Jordan. When I looked across
[2:01:40] Jordan, I said, "Oh, praise God. Just on
[2:01:43] the other side is where all the promises
[2:01:46] lay. Every promise lays in the promised
[2:01:49] land." Notice the prophet of God. He
[2:01:51] come two pulls of the journey.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; He come through the first pull sign in
[2:01:57] the hand. He come through the second
[2:01:58] pool of discernment. But the third pull.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; The third pull was the opening of the
[2:02:05] word.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; The third pull was just speaking
[2:02:07] squirrels into existence. It was coming
[2:02:10] into the opening of the word which is
[2:02:12] the believer's hiding place. This word
[2:02:16] is our protection. God fortified us
[2:02:19] behind the word. Amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; But notice they come out on the
[2:02:28] testimony of a prophet. They come out
[2:02:33] with a message of a vindicated leader.
[2:02:37] In Deuteronomy 2 that says, "Then
[2:02:40] we turn, Moses talking. We took our
[2:02:43] journey into the wilderness by the way
[2:02:46] of the Red Sea as the Lord spake unto me
[2:02:48] and we compass Mount Zir many days. And
[2:02:52] the Lord spake unto me saying, you have
[2:02:54] compassed this mountain long enough.
[2:03:01] Turn northward."
[2:03:05] Some of you full gospel, you got great
[2:03:07] ministry,
[2:03:10] you got great leaders. Some of you young
[2:03:12] people, you've been to great camps.
[2:03:16] For some of us, all we've done is gone
[2:03:19] around and around and around. God sent a
[2:03:23] prophet. I'm a message believer and
[2:03:26] that's all we know about it. God sent a
[2:03:29] prophet. I've repented. I'm justified.
[2:03:32] Let me tell you, there's more to this
[2:03:34] message.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; There's more than just God sending a
[2:03:37] prophet. There's more than just I'm a
[2:03:39] message believer. There's more than all
[2:03:42] that, church. There is a land.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; All the promises
[2:03:49] lay in the land.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Can I go just a few more minutes? Amen.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; See, Israel, they came twothirds of the
[2:03:59] journey
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; under a vindicated voice.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; And I hope this don't sound bad, but I'm
[2:04:04] trying to show you the parallel. And
[2:04:06] though they were following Moses's
[2:04:08] message, they never entered into the
[2:04:10] land of promise.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And we find here in Deuteronomy 2 and
[2:04:16] verse 13, he says, "Now rise up, said I,
[2:04:19] and get you over to the brook of Zared."
[2:04:21] And we went over to the brook of Zered
[2:04:23] in a space in which we came from Kadesh
[2:04:25] Barnea until we come to the brook of Zer
[2:04:28] was 38 years until all the generation of
[2:04:31] men of war were wasted out from among
[2:04:34] the host as the Lord swearing to him. So
[2:04:36] Kades they come to Aadesh Barnea and
[2:04:38] that word there means judgment seed of
[2:04:41] God.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; And Kades Barnea was three days journey.
[2:04:47] Brother Ron, they could look up and they
[2:04:49] could see the promised land,
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't go in.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; They heard the stories of how it took
[2:04:57] two men to carry a cluster of grace
[2:04:59] back, but they couldn't partake of it.
[2:05:01] They've heard of the stories of how it
[2:05:03] was a land that flowed with milk and
[2:05:05] honey, but they never could set any
[2:05:07] claims in it. For 38 years, they were on
[2:05:10] the outskirts
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; streaming.
[2:05:15] Woo! Look at full gospel lighthouse,
[2:05:19] man. They had a meeting on September and
[2:05:22] Labor Day. My the power of God flow.
[2:05:25] Some of them just streaming in, just
[2:05:27] looking in.
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; And here they just, you know, they're
[2:05:33] just keeping us preaching the same old
[2:05:35] doctrines of repentance. God sent a
[2:05:37] prophet. We're believers. All you got to
[2:05:39] do is wear that eagle belt buckle.
[2:05:40] You're sure to get in.
[2:05:43] Put that little trinket on the door. The
[2:05:45] blood's been applied. You're sure to
[2:05:46] make it. Hopeless to tape on that
[2:05:49] certain certain time. You're sure to be
[2:05:51] a real bonafide believer. Let me tell
[2:05:53] you, that has nothing to do with this
[2:05:55] message. This message is Jesus Christ
[2:05:58] dwelling on the inside of a believer.
[2:06:02] That's your hiding place. That's your
[2:06:04] refuge. It ain't some relic. It ain't
[2:06:07] some trinket. It's God Almighty dwelling
[2:06:10] in lives of men and women, church.
[2:06:15] But 38 years they looked over.
[2:06:19] I wonder
[2:06:21] I wonder what it's like in that land.
[2:06:25] Man, we've seen all that emotion over
[2:06:27] there. Boy, they got excited,
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; man. They spoke in tongues and they fell
[2:06:33] out and they were spoken tongues all
[2:06:37] night. kept waking up and going back to
[2:06:38] sleep speaking in tongues.
[2:06:42] Man, it's a good land, church.
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; It's a land that flows with milk and
[2:06:48] honey.
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; See, and brother M said,
[2:06:54] he wants to give us the Holy Ghost
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; more than we even want to receive it.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; He wants you to enter in to that third
[2:07:05] pull. He wants you to enter into that
[2:07:07] opening of the word where all the
[2:07:10] promises, healing, deliverance,
[2:07:13] supernatural,
[2:07:15] all that you have need of is in that
[2:07:18] land.
[2:07:21] But you got to make a decision.
[2:07:24] See, God's promise did not lie in the
[2:07:26] wilderness.
[2:07:28] He called you out to take you somewhere.
[2:07:33] God sent us a vindicated messenger and
[2:07:37] we have left on the testimony of William
[2:07:40] Brandham. He had a visitation from the
[2:07:43] angel of the Lord.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; We've come out.
[2:07:51] But see, Moses
[2:07:53] couldn't take them in.
[2:07:56] But God had a Joshua there ready to take
[2:07:59] him in.
[2:08:01] And under the same message, Joshua
[2:08:03] preached the same message that Moses
[2:08:05] preached
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; and entered into that land.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; And can I tell you, the same message
[2:08:11] that William Brand was preaching, we're
[2:08:13] preaching.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; The same message that Paul preached,
[2:08:18] we're preaching.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; And that's where we're headed, church.
[2:08:21] We're going into the land. He says, "Now
[2:08:24] in my father's house are many mansions.
[2:08:26] If it were not so, I would have told
[2:08:27] you. But I go to prepare you a place
[2:08:28] that if I go to prepare you a place, I
[2:08:31] will come again. I receive you unto
[2:08:32] myself that where I am, there you may be
[2:08:36] also.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; So we've not come as I begin to close,
[2:08:39] musicians can make your way back. We've
[2:08:41] not come to talk about the message.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Well, on certain certain page and
[2:08:47] certain certain book and a certain
[2:08:48] certain certain and a certain certain
[2:08:49] certain look, this ain't old McDonald
[2:08:51] had a farm.
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:08:58] We have not come to talk about the
[2:09:01] messes.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; We have done that for years.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; We talked about it. Favorite quotes. Oh,
[2:09:07] this is my favorite quote. This is this,
[2:09:09] this is this favorite tape, favorite
[2:09:10] this, favorite that. We've talked about
[2:09:12] it. He says, "We've not come to talk
[2:09:14] about the message. We come together to
[2:09:16] get in the message."
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; See, and the message is Christ.
[2:09:24] That's right.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; So many times we mistake and and I'm
[2:09:27] sorry, but when I first came to this
[2:09:29] message, we mistake the message as
[2:09:31] William Brand. William Brandom's not the
[2:09:34] message.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; He was only the voice that the angel
[2:09:40] used.
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; He was only the vessel.
[2:09:44] And I had a quote in here and and I I
[2:09:47] don't have time to try to find it, but
[2:09:49] here we find in the time of trouble,
[2:09:51] he's going to hide us, church. lay us
[2:09:53] back in that pavilion there in that
[2:09:55] secret place. And the believer is
[2:09:57] fortified behind the word. And we find
[2:10:00] it in Psalm or Isaiah 32. He said, "A
[2:10:03] man shall be a hiding place from the
[2:10:04] wind, a covert from the tempest, rivers
[2:10:06] of waters in a dry land, and a shadow as
[2:10:09] a great rock in a weary land." So he's
[2:10:12] prophesying,
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Isaiah's prophesying there's going to be
[2:10:15] a king come. Not just a king, but the
[2:10:18] king of kings. And he's going to come.
[2:10:19] He's going to be the Messiah. He's going
[2:10:21] to reign in righteousness. And this man,
[2:10:23] the man Christ Jesus, he's going to be a
[2:10:25] hiding place from the wind, a covert
[2:10:27] from the tempest. He's going to endure
[2:10:29] all the full force of the storm that's
[2:10:31] that's that we've faced, church. And
[2:10:33] he's going to be a shelter. And people
[2:10:35] today, we got people that are prepping
[2:10:36] and they're they got bomb shelters and
[2:10:39] this shelter and that shelter. And the
[2:10:40] prophet of God said, "Look, they got
[2:10:42] bombs. They blow 150 ft deep.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; There's no shelter out there that you
[2:10:47] can run to. The only shelter that we
[2:10:49] have is the shelter of his wings today.
[2:10:52] And he said Jesus Christ is that
[2:10:54] shelter. He's that hiding place. Let me
[2:10:57] tell you, that's what I'm trying to
[2:10:58] point you to tonight. It ain't to a man.
[2:11:00] It ain't to a gift. It ain't to a
[2:11:02] church, but it's to Jesus Christ. He is
[2:11:05] the word made flesh in this hour.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; He is your hiding place.
[2:11:12] So no matter what you face,
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; no matter what you go through,
[2:11:18] you're protected.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; You're protected. You're safe. And death
[2:11:24] can't even touch you inside of that
[2:11:26] hiding place. When we walk in the
[2:11:28] presence of God, notice the things of
[2:11:31] the world
[2:11:34] are hidden behind us. Brother Chris,
[2:11:36] when when the high priest will enter
[2:11:38] into the Holy of Holies,
[2:11:41] had a pomegranate and a bell tied to his
[2:11:44] foot.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; He had to be dressed right.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; He had to talk right and he had to be
[2:11:52] anointed right.
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; And when he would go in, brother Ron,
[2:11:58] that palm of Granland bell would begin
[2:12:00] to sing, "Holy, holy, holy unto the
[2:12:03] Lord. Holy, holy, holy until see that
[2:12:07] was the only way they knew that he was
[2:12:10] alive.
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; And can I tell you when you walk in this
[2:12:14] house, when you walk into the presence
[2:12:16] of God, your life should be cried holy,
[2:12:18] holy, holy unto the Lord. That's the
[2:12:21] only way we as ministry, we know that
[2:12:24] you're alive. When your life is cried
[2:12:26] holy to God, no matter how you feel,
[2:12:28] it's holy to the Lord. No matter what
[2:12:30] you've been through, it's holy to the
[2:12:32] Lord. No matter the sickness, no matter
[2:12:34] the affliction, no matter the trial,
[2:12:36] your life is crying holy, holy to the
[2:12:40] Lord.
[2:12:43] See, he wasn't on the outskirts anymore.
[2:12:48] He come in and enter into the presence
[2:12:51] of shakina glory and the badger skin
[2:12:54] dropped behind him. And brother Ram
[2:12:56] said, "Now everything was silent.
[2:13:00] All the cares of the world are put on
[2:13:02] the outside. He found a hiding place.
[2:13:07] See, it's always been that way. Not the
[2:13:09] first court, not the second court, but
[2:13:12] the third court, the third stage of the
[2:13:14] journey, church. In there is where we
[2:13:16] have our protection. In there is where
[2:13:18] we find comfort and peace.
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:23] As I begin to close here,
[2:13:28] 32 and verse 28, Psalms 32 and verse 28
[2:13:31] says, "And I will instruct thee and
[2:13:34] teach thee in the way which thou shalt
[2:13:37] go, and I will guide thee with my eye."
[2:13:42] [Music]
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; What is the eye of the Lord? A prophet,
[2:13:47] a seer. I'm going to guide you with my
[2:13:51] prophet, with my prophetic eye. I'm
[2:13:53] going to send you a a man of God, and
[2:13:57] he's going to lead you, and he's going
[2:13:59] to he's going to open up the revelation
[2:14:02] of that sealed book. We're going to can
[2:14:04] maybe get into that tomorrow. He's going
[2:14:06] to open up the revelation
[2:14:08] that you can see this is who you are.
[2:14:10] This is where you come from. This is
[2:14:12] your protection. But he said God's
[2:14:15] guiding eye. and he would send a prophet
[2:14:17] and he would guide his people. That's
[2:14:19] why he sent Moses to guide them out of
[2:14:22] Egypt and to take them into the promised
[2:14:24] land. And he sent you a prophet to guide
[2:14:26] you out of your Egypt, to guide you out
[2:14:28] of that denomination, to guide you out
[2:14:30] of that life of sin and to bring you
[2:14:32] into the promised land of the opening of
[2:14:35] the word. Oh, hallelujah, church. That's
[2:14:37] where he's guiding us. That's our hiding
[2:14:40] place in this hour. God sent a seer. He
[2:14:43] sent a prophet. And brother Brandham
[2:14:45] taught us that a prophet is not only
[2:14:47] just a mouthpiece of God. He's God's
[2:14:49] channel, God's eye to the people.
[2:14:51] Because a prophet is a seer. He can see
[2:14:55] what we can't see. He can go up into
[2:14:58] heights that we can't climb into.
[2:15:03] And he expressed that a prophet
[2:15:04] functions as God's eyes on the earth
[2:15:08] to reveal his will
[2:15:11] and guide his people. God's eye is on
[2:15:15] his elect leading them to the land of
[2:15:19] promise. God's eye today is leading the
[2:15:21] elect,
[2:15:22] the predestinated bride to her hiding
[2:15:25] place. And he would say this in God's
[2:15:28] eye, God's eye reflects his will.
[2:15:33] And brother Mark, that word will there
[2:15:35] means purpose.
[2:15:37] God's eye reflects his purpose. Why a
[2:15:44] message?
[2:15:46] Why a prophet
[2:15:49] to call you out,
[2:15:52] but not just to let you wander?
[2:15:55] He's taken you somewhere.
[2:15:59] No matter where David found himself,
[2:16:02] thou
[2:16:04] art my hiding place.
[2:16:06] No matter where you find yourself
[2:16:08] tonight, church,
[2:16:10] Christ, the word is our refuge. The
[2:16:13] revealed word for this age is Jesus
[2:16:15] Christ. And just as Israel had blood on
[2:16:18] the doorpost of Egypt, believers today
[2:16:20] must have the spirit applied to their
[2:16:22] lives. That's the protection against
[2:16:24] judgment. Brother man would teach us, he
[2:16:27] understood that spiritually through
[2:16:28] revelation, that the strong tower is
[2:16:32] where the bride hides. We have no other
[2:16:34] refuge. Brother Ron, but this message,
[2:16:38] see the message movement is not our
[2:16:41] hiding place.
[2:16:44] The name William Miam Brandom,
[2:16:48] and please forgive me for saying this,
[2:16:50] but that's not our hiding place.
[2:16:54] The message is Christ
[2:16:57] and he is the word and the word is your
[2:17:03] hiding place.
[2:17:07] Good days or bad days,
[2:17:11] you found a secret place.
[2:17:17] An angel. You show me today where he
[2:17:20] stood.
[2:17:22] If you trust me,
[2:17:26] he's never backed off of that promise
[2:17:27] that he gave you five years ago. If you
[2:17:30] trust me, I'll use you like never
[2:17:33] before.
[2:17:37] Can I tell you church,
[2:17:40] they may have not entered into the land,
[2:17:43] but the promise remains.
[2:17:47] They may have failed to enter into their
[2:17:49] land and they went around the the
[2:17:51] mountain for 38 years, but the promise
[2:17:54] remains for you today. Some of these old
[2:17:57] fighters out there, all they can preach
[2:17:58] is God sent a prophet. But let me tell
[2:18:00] you, there's more for you today, church.
[2:18:03] There's more. God's guiding eye is
[2:18:05] leading us into the land, a land of
[2:18:08] safety, a land of rest. God is here
[2:18:10] tonight to not only heal you, not only
[2:18:12] deliver you, but he's here to give you
[2:18:14] the Holy Ghost. He's going to take some
[2:18:16] of you. You've been going around that
[2:18:18] depression. You've been going around
[2:18:20] with fear. You've been going around with
[2:18:22] anxiety. You've been coming in, going
[2:18:24] out, coming in, going out. But I'm here
[2:18:26] to tell you today, it's time to come
[2:18:28] inside of Christ. It's time to get the
[2:18:30] Holy Ghost. It's time for a move of the
[2:18:32] spirit. It's time to let the Holy Ghost
[2:18:35] Holy Ghost tonight. It's time to let go
[2:18:38] and let God fill this place. Would you
[2:18:41] say amen to that? Would you stand and
[2:18:43] say, "God, fill this place. God, come
[2:18:46] today. Lord, take me to that hiding
[2:18:48] place.
[2:18:51] Take me, Lord, into that hiding place."
[2:18:55] And if you're here today, you've never
[2:18:58] entered in.
[2:19:00] He's here for you.
[2:19:03] He's here for you. You got a need today,
[2:19:07] I serve a great God.
[2:19:12] I was preaching in Mexico last week
[2:19:15] and a pastor's wife come up on Friday
[2:19:18] night, brother Ron, and she said,
[2:19:20] "Brother Joe,
[2:19:22] as you was preaching, the Lord healed me
[2:19:25] in my seat."
[2:19:28] And that's through a language barrier.
[2:19:32] And if God can do that through a
[2:19:34] language barrier, what can God do for
[2:19:36] you tonight? What can God do for Full
[2:19:38] Gospel Lighthouse? Let don't leave out
[2:19:41] of here and let this just be another
[2:19:43] service. God has put a message on my
[2:19:46] heart. Thou art my hiding place. And
[2:19:49] some of you, you need to come tonight
[2:19:51] and find refuge and find protection and
[2:19:54] find safety and find the Holy Ghost.
[2:19:58] Some of you young people been battling.
[2:20:00] Do I have it? Do I have it? Do I have
[2:20:02] it? Is it for me? One day you're up, the
[2:20:05] next day you're down. One day you're up,
[2:20:06] the next day you're down. One day you
[2:20:08] got it, the next day you don't.
[2:20:11] It's a secure place.
[2:20:14] Today, tonight, you can know that you
[2:20:18] know that you know that you know.
[2:20:24] You don't have to go out of here to
[2:20:25] save.
[2:20:29] Brother said, "The angel
[2:20:32] of the Lord accompanies the message."
[2:20:38] I have preached to you the message.
[2:20:44] And I'm going to tell you, he's here.
[2:20:47] Said, "Brother Joe, do you see him?" No,
[2:20:49] I don't have to see him.
[2:20:52] He honors his word. And if I can get you
[2:20:55] to believe this evening, if I can get
[2:20:57] you to turn away from your doubts, turn
[2:20:59] away from your unbelief, turn away from
[2:21:02] everything you've been running to and
[2:21:03] run to him tonight. Let me tell you,
[2:21:06] church, the altar is open. You need
[2:21:07] healing for your body, the altar's open
[2:21:09] tonight.
[2:21:11] You need deliverance, you've been in a
[2:21:12] battle, the altar is open tonight. You
[2:21:14] need the Holy Ghost,
[2:21:16] he's here. Won't you come, Brother
[2:21:20] Andrew?

[2:24:12] Hallelujah. Some of you just need to
[2:24:14] come in.

[2:24:26] Won't you just let him come just now?
[2:24:30] Won't you let him come? Hallelujah.

[2:30:50] stepped in and saved the day.
[2:31:02] And it's still raining.
[2:31:08] And as the thunder rolls,
[2:31:12] I barely hear your whisper through the
[2:31:17] rain.
[2:31:20] I'm with you.
[2:31:26] And as your mercy falls,
[2:31:30] I raise my hand.
[2:31:33] He's the God who gives
[2:31:38] and takes away.
