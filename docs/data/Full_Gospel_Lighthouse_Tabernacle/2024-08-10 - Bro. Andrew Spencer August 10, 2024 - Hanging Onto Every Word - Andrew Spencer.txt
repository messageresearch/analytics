God bless you it's good to be back here at home again amen we we certainly miss you all while we're away but we bring greetings from uh Cloverdale Bible Way and all the the Believers there in that portion of Canada and Washington and they send their greetings to you if I if I would say who all told me to tell you hello and to greet you all we'd be here all not but just know that there is a portion of the body of Christ that loves you all around the world and I tell you we were just so blessed and the meetings were I don't know if you watched it yet or not if you haven't do you can go visit their their uh website there I believe it's bibleway.org and I believe those meetings will be a blessing to you and just to see the supernatural element of uh of all the events of the meetings just coming together I I tell you we were we were in very uh Heavenly places and we seen some mighty things people that people and young young men and young women given their heart to the Lord and just moved and the Lord just moved in a very Sovereign way and we're just thankful that we could go and be a be able to be a a benefit to the kingdom of God and amen we we bring greetings from Brother Tom and brother Michael and we just had a wonderful time in uh in the in the word of the Lord and I know you'd be very proud of your pastor and he did a he did a phenomenal job and and uh the Lord used him in a very special way and brother Ron's got a very unique gift and uh we're certainly privileged to call him our pastor here so amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to uh look over in a couple portions of scripture man there's so many things that we could say say about the meetings and to uh just to witness it all it was uh very special special they uh brother Michael and their their team they put on a theme every year at their camp and and uh just to see how the Lord had aligned us as ministers to just to say some things and Minister on some thoughts brother Ron's brother Ron's series of sermons that he spoke in those meetings were let us run and that was a theme of let us run uh in that camp so it was very it was very special to to be a part of those things and we realize that God is in the details of all of all that we do and if we could realize just how how important that we are how how that every word that we speak and sometimes you don't even know why you say things but you could just see the spirit of God that works that works on the front side and on the back side of everything that he aligns he aligns everything with his word for a certain season for a certain time and I just I just think it's very I think it's very um pertinent for us as Believers to catch the very mind of God of where we are and in the season that we're in and when you see those things lining up it it certainly it certainly is a blessing amen amen the Bible uh we'd like to look here uh in in the Bible in 1 Timothy chapter 6 and 12 and then Luke chapter 19 and verse 46 and just like to draw a thought here tonight out of these out of these scriptures and uh while you're turning there we like to uh just speak to the author of the word and I know that we've got many many needs here that are amongst us and I know that uh uh you all are aware of this by now that brother Joe had to cancel uh the the later portion of of his uh camp meeting there in Ruth and uhu so we just want to be remembering them they had several uh sick cases that arose and I know there's others that were there that that uh that got sick and different things and so we just want to be remembering them and it's not an easy thing to cancel a meeting so we we certainly uh admonish brother Joe and uh in following the leading of the Lord in that matter and uh so we realize that there could be some disappointments in humanity but we realize this that there is no disappointment in almighty God and I I know this that if if maybe you were planning to go to those meetings and you feel like you were you were maybe robbed of a blessing I I just want you to know that God is not that kind of a God God is the kind of God that pays he pays his dividends and he's not the kind of God that we will be disappointed in we might get disappointed in humanity but we shall never be disappointed in Elohim himself so we realize that he's all sufficient and we realize that he's mindful of every single one of the the Believers that put monies and invested in different things and I believe that God will return it back to every one of those brothers and I pray God would just bless our brother Joe we just want to admonish him and from from our hearts here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we certainly love him and and appreciate him with all that is within us amen let's just let's just speak to the Lord tonight as we get ready to delve into the word here Heavenly Father we come before you Lord one more time we have gathered as your children Lord here in the presence Lord of not just not just regular men and women but these are Sons and Daughters of God that have been called and ordained and elected before the foundation of the world but Lord more than just being in the presence of Sons we realize that we are in the presence of The Great I Am and Lord we just ask that the lord of the word would come tonight and you would just stretch forth your bow of the Holy Ghost and be able to bring it back and forth across a word that it would speak a rhythm of the Holy Spirit to our hearts that we would find the very channel of the holy spirit that you have asked us to be in and I pray father that you would just take us into special places here tonight Lord something that has been spoken to me this past week Lord that I have I have looked into this week and I pray that you would give me liberty to be able to speak these things father that you have placed on My Heart Lord and I pray that you would just allow your children tonight Lord to be able to let themselves go in the Supernatural that they could find the promises of God are for them in this moment for every sick person that is amongst us for every uplifted request and every uplifted hand and every unspoken request we ask that the that the lord of the host would come amongst us and you would begin to bless your children abundantly by the grace of God I pray that you do these things Lord and we'll be careful to serve you as we get out of the way just now we pray that you would have the preeminence in this service in the name of Jesus Christ and the bride says amen 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 12 Paul in his letter here to Timothy says fight the good fight of faith and lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou Art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all things and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebuked unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ also Luke chap 19 and verse 46 I've always loved the love these words but after this week of study I I don't think that I'll ever read them the same Luke chapter 19 and verse 46 saying unto them it is written my house is the House of Prayer but you have made it a denes and just to catch your mind in this in this drama here that this is when Jesus has just come down off off of the mount and he's wept for he's wept for Jerusalem he comes in he he comes in there and he sees the house of God as it's been as it's been made into a a den of Thieves they're bringing in monies and different things and Jesus gets it gets upset and spirit and he begins to flip over tables and all of these things and Jesus begins to say these words it is written my house is the House of Prayer but you made it a den of Thieves and I love this and he taught daily in the temple but the CH Chief priest and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him very attentive to hear him may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord we are just coming from a camp as we've just spoken these things to you where we have witnessed the supernatural element of the Lord and how all the meetings and everything was aligned and and God ordained that meeting from start to finish and on let us run and and we were allowed to we went was able to spend some time with our brother Bisal and and I got permission to be able to say these things tonight and and so but we were we were spending we just spent a few minutes with our brother Bisal and he looked at me and he he he just said these words he these words he said we're hanging on to every word we're hanging on to every word and as soon as our brother Bisal begin to say those words to me the preacher on the inside of me started to go to work and and and I have I have spent some very very specific times on this on this on this thought this weekend or this week and I'd like to bring some of these things that the Lord has has dealt with me on on this thought and I here I was I was thinking here's here's a brother that we have held with the utmost esteem as as a man that has preached this message without favor and without Fain he has stood here in this Pulpit he stood around the world and I was thinking a man that's some 90 years old could still be preaching to us even here today and I'd like to just maybe take a thought and just build it up here on hanging on to every word and out of those meetings out of those meetings I I could say that we literally witnessed a a a group of kids and a group of Believers that were literally hanging on to the very Supernatural elements that they were being a part of and they were witnessing and that word to hang on to every word it means to extremely it means to pay extremely close to attention to what someone is saying often because of information or is very important or interesting it suggests that the listener is very engaged and attentive absorbing every detail of the conversation and we realize that there are certain elements there are certain people that have the ability to be able to hold a a congregation or hold a crowd or hold a space of people and hold them in the grips of their hands by just by just speaking words and you can you can literally see as people are sitting there as they're they're hanging on every word that is coming off of the orator lips and we find there's many many different many different Bible characters that we could look at throughout the Bible and it would for it time would fail us if we would go through and we would look at all the characters that would spend time if we'd look at it on men and women that would literally hang on the word of God just like Mary the mother of Jesus when the angel Gabriel begin to appear unto her and begin to say certain things that you're going to conceive a a child and you're going to be you're going to conceive a child that will be of the Holy Ghost and she responded with complete trust in God's word and she looked upon the angel Gabriel and said be it unto me according to the word of God she look she literally hung her entire soul as an absolute on the word of God she hung everything that she had on the word of God to think that the angel Gabriel could take her from a spot of natural to a place of the Supernatural and she would literally hang her entire soul upon the word of God even David as we would look at King David he's another example of someone who clung on to God's word and David would Express that in in different Psalms and in different words that he would Express the Deep resilience and Reliance that he had upon the Commandments of God's word because the Bible said in Psalms 119 and 105 that your word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my that David it shows us that David constantly sought to live according to God's word it is it's no it's no secret to us as Believers as Bible Believers that the Apostle Paul he hung on to God's word with Incredible in tenacity despare despite facing immense persecution and hardship he encouraged others to do the same thing by writing in Colossians 3 and16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly and all wisdom wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with Grace in your hearts to the Lord and not whatsoever you do in word or In Deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks to God and the father by him you see Paul would write out letters and he would write out his very he would write out his very emotions and he would exhort the Brethren to cling upon the word of God and upon the teachings of Christ and Paul would give his very own life as he was hanging on to the word of God in his day and his age he was living and hanging on that his age was the age of rapture because God did not release that unto him but he was clinging on to it with everything that was within him Daniel was a man who exemplified unwavering faith in God's word even when he fac when he was faced with lifethreatening when he would stand there in life-threatening situations Daniel was a man that had his resolve and he was committed unto the faith of almighty God that even when there came out a a a capital uh punishment that if any man would would bow and pray to anybody else except for the King Daniel didn't care but his trust was solely upon the word of God even though they would send him to a lion's den Daniel fully trusted that the word of God would sustain him and he was literally hanging on the word of God that God was was more than able to get him out of the Lion's Den that he was more than able and even in that tenacity and even in that Despair and even in that conflict these men and these women had the power to believe there was something on the inside of them that was empowering them to hang on to every word of God and I believe that I believe as Christians that's what we ought to do I believe that we don't we shouldn't just read the word of God as just a as a newspaper I don't believe that we should read it as a magazine or as Facebook or some something but I believe that we ought to hinge our entire and our entire Eternal destination upon the word of God because men's word will fail us but God's word won't fail us Facebook will fail us that Fox News will fail us CNN will fail us all the things of the world will fail us but God's word has never failed it is always been infallible it has always been unfailing in every aspect of the word of God it has never let down and it is never backed off of its promises now the prophet would say this and let your light so shine he said now he said only way that we see Christ is when he reflects in each other he said I see Christ in you you see him and me he said that's how we watch Christ he said I come to the meeting I start preaching I watch the people you can see whether they're interested or not just a few minutes you look over the audience and you can tell whether you're boring them or or not he said and the first thing that you know he said you see them sitting there hanging on to every word under expectation see I'm seeing Christ reflected in that person because he's hungering and thirsting for God and then me preaching the gospel sees Christ reflecting in me I can see Christ reflecting in him he said that means that Christ is in our midst see a man hungering and thirsting so we can recognize simply by by your expression of Faith by amening the word of God and hungering upon it and thirsting for more of God and by the by the preacher getting under the atmosphere of it we can literally recognize that Christ is in our midst when somebody gets interested in what the word is saying and the preacher preacher gets into the atmosphere of his gift you can literally understand that Christ is in the midst of us I hope you understand what I'm saying to you is that is that if there's something that's on the inside of you that maybe you have had a bad day maybe you've had some very tormental times in your life that maybe maybe the maybe the singing board you maybe the song specials didn't come out and just bless you the way that you thought they would but all of a sudden the preaching of the word captures your attention and you're held spell by Spellbound by the word of God you're literally hanging up it and you see that the preacher gets under the atmosphere or under the anointing of it you literally watch Christ come into the midst of the Church of the Living God because Jesus would say it like this that the Bible would say that every man it is written that every man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so when you see men begin to hunger and thirst for almighty God it shows you that Christ is in the midst of the Church of the Living God now notice what what the scripture said in Luke 19- 48 that the Bible said that the people were very attentive to hear him if you look that word up in the Greek it means to hang from that means to hang from there was there was never any lack of crowds Around Jesus there was never any lack of crowds Around Jesus there was crowd s that were literally clinging to him and hanging upon his words that word it's rendered it attentive it means it signifies that they heard him with great eagerness and diligence and were ready to catch every word that dropped from his lips you can just imagine as he would gather the children in as he would gather them up on the mountain and he would take them through the Beatitudes and he would preach one of the greatest sermons that's ever been preached you can imagine William Brandon would say it like this he said to understand the supernatural element about Jesus's voice that he could speak and 5,000 people would hear him that he's standing there and people are literally hanging upon his words just waiting for the next word to come off of his lips they were exceedingly taken with him now there was a lot of other teachers in the Land There was a a lot of different prophets that was in the Land There was a lot of another anointed people in the land the prophet would say that there had already been jesuses before Jesus Christ that had already been prophets before Jesus Christ but the Bibles would tell us that no man spake like this man that these people had gathered around not just to be around the person not just to be around another teacher not just to be around another Prophet but they were literally standing in the presence of Elohim in flesh the prophet would say it in token in the message token he said apply and create an atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it he said oh you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a Christian they love for you to say something to them they love for you to say something to them woo they love for you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it so I believe that if we've got that much influence if we've got that much T power that the choken life of Jesus Christ is on the inside of us that people liter love for us to speak to them I believe that we ought to handle our words a little bit differently I don't believe that we ought to just spat off at the mouth I don't believe that we ought to just say things halfhazard I don't think that we ought to just go by Impressions but I believe that we ought to put something on our lips I believe that we ought to ordain and AD have adoration for the holy spirit that we would entertain his presence that unbelievers that skeptic that critics that people that do not walk the way of a Christian would literally long for you to say something to them come on somebody this has taking you past just your work past just your job past just a preacher pass just a leoty but this put you in position as a Son of God that people literally hold on to the words Hallelujah I know I I feel that atmosphere building right here that people are literally waiting for the next word to drop I've studied I've looked I've prayed about it but sometimes as a minister let me put you under the let me put you where you can see it from my eyes just for a minute I have studied I have looked at it I've looked at the word of God I have a Direction but you don't necessarily know that you don't know the direction and sometimes the spirit of God begins to use a man and he gets under the influence of the holy spirit that men and women are literally waiting on the word of God to drop out of their mouth to heal their bodies come on somebody to heal your mind to heal your broken heart to heal you that people are literally Hallelujah I believe that if Ministry could look at it in that aspect that the words that drop out of our mouth could literally heal somebody that could literally bring that could literally bring power to a situation they could deliver somebody from change we're L hallelujah we're hanging on this message we're hanging onto the sayith the Lord Brother Brandon would say it's like a love affair he said if you was going with a girl because you knew it was your duty or you going with a boy when you're young he said just because your mama wants you to go with that guy he said but you can't stand him you don't get nothing out of him coming to see you he said oh it's the same way about a girl to the boy or the boy to the girl you go with her but she bores you but mama wants you to go with her because it's this type she's this type of a girl that mama likes see it bores you it's not a love affair but you don't care you don't want to clean up you don't want to go to see her it's why it's a horrible thing when he is coming to see you my he just wish you just wish he would hurry on and go on home he said that's the same way it is he said when you why does he preach so long what about all this stuff and everything see you're not in love but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit would give warning this morning hang on to every word that that might be what he has been talking you about holding on it's eternal life every word of God it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance whether it's hot cold indiff whether the people are fussing growling whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love with Jesus Christ then you love to go to church not say well honey here it's Sunday morning again I guess we have to wash up the youngans and get down there my it's boresome see you're not in love but if you're really in love you can't wait till Sunday Morning Comes you just got to get down there with them it's a love affair there's something about being the brown Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ with brothers and sisters that are uniting under the same Faith under the same Oneness under the same power what is it It's A Love Affair you don't hate you don't hate your brethren you don't hate being here with them but you love it let me tell you if you go to church and you're bored you're not going to the right church if you're going to this church and you're bored you're not feeding on the message of the hour if you're in this church and you're bored you need to get in love with Jesus because this message is none other than Jesus Christ Hallelujah you begin to look at Christ when Jesus comes and you watch immediately how fast his ministry progressed the popularity and the fame that got behind it this is a man that's this is a man that's only had in his lifetime he's only had three and a half years of ministry but he draws Thrones and crowds and men from every aspect of life from the high and the low he grabs them by his words his popularity would grow and the Bible would say it like this that the people were astonished at his Doctrine for his word was with power again it would say that he taught them as one that had Authority his hearers wanted to know when does this man have this wisdom the officers of the Sanhedrin declared that never a man spake like this man his enemy's purpose was defeated when they said they could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentative of him he didn't have to seek an audience an audience seek him he didn't have to seek a place to preach from he had to seek a place to hide because the very all all they needed was one word all they needed was one line all they needed was one sentence and it could change their situation if one word had the ability to break and send people to a devil's hell and break them out of break them into bondage and bring them into sin and bring them into unbelief how much power is in one word hallelujah how much power is in one word that if we got oursel in this midst if Adam and Eve sold us into sin slavery by breaking not a sentence not a line but one word how powerful brother Timothy is that one word that's why I believe that Believers come here let me say it like like Ruth Ruth was looking for one handful and maybe you come here looking for one word maybe you just need him to say over you you're healed you're forgiven you're Justified you're Sanctified it's over maybe you just need that one word I say it unto you it's that powerful it's h powerful that literally this word can literally change your destination this word can change your spiritual altitude this word can take you into Heavenly places am I going to am I going too fast for you am I going too high for you but I believe hallelujah it's by one word if he had the power to say Let There Be lighted surely has the power to say Let Them Be Free let them be healed let them overcome surely he's got that same power tonight nobody had ever spoke like him he had the ability to hold thousands upon thousands and he would stand there and he would simply talk to them about the grass he would talk to them about natural things he would talk to them about the winds and talk to them about fair weather and foul weather he would talk to them about the fig trees he would talk to them about the Ravens he would talk to them about The Sparrows his words were so natural his words were so natural but in a sense he can literally bring Heaven to Earth by the preaching of Natural Things he could bring Heaven down on Earth by simply saying certain words in a certain way to show what season that the Church of the Living God was hanging in and people were heading sitting there and they were paying close attention you know the prophet said that our soul is hanging over top of Hell by a chain he said and Adam and Eve sold us into sin he said what they do they broke that one word they broke that one word he said and that chain that's over top of that is the word of God and it's your faith in the word of God you see your soul your soul is hanging over top of Hell your soul is passing over hell hanging on the word of God he said so don't let somebody squeeze something into you that's not safe the Lord now notice forgive me forgive me you don't know what it's like to be studying something and all of a sudden it comes alive if you could put yourself in my shoes just for a minute I've looked at this I've looked at these words I've I've held these words I've I've prayed these words in my prayers i' I've thought about them but to watch them come into fruition it's more than sometimes we can handle because I realize that I'm not just dropping this this word off just to anybody but I'm dropping this word to bride Believers I'm dropping this word off to a people that believe God that have held on to every word and you literally understand the moment that you're in don't tell me don't tell me the woman that had the blood issue didn't understand what the moment that she was in when she waited for this moment she' heard about it she was hanging if she could just touch His Garment she was hanging on that moment her faith was hanging over top of hell with that one word if I can just get to Jesus if I can just touch His Garment what about you tonight what about you in your situation what about you in your life what if you could get to Jesus with one word with one aspiration of life to say let me fight the good fight of Faith so I can lay hold on it though we know this that the word of God Is Creative that the Bible would say that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made Hebrews 11:3 tells us that though through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so when God speaks I'm always amazed at people that that that say that God said all of this to him when Abraham only had a certain word words that were spoken to him what I'm trying to say is that God doesn't just spout off at the mouth and I'm also amazed at people that call themselves Christians they can quote everything that the devil has told them he's told them that they're Liars he's he's told them that they'll never make it he's told them that their daddy died this way and their granddaddy died that way and this person died with cancer so I I guess I'll die with cancer but they can't requote one word word so when God is saying something he's not just spouting off at the mouth but he's literally got intentions with his word he's got a purpose behind his word he's saying something with a reason notice what the Bible said that in Isaiah 55:11 so shall my word be that goth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sin it so when Jesus is standing there Jesus literally proves himself as the word of God he proves that he's Elohim he proves his position I love what the how the prophet said it and when their eyes were open he said he said that's how the prophets Jesus called them Gods he said that's how Jesus proved himself and that woman knowed he was a word because he could discern the thoughts here I think it's amazing that here she comes to a well she's a sinner in one aspect and all of a sudden Jesus drops starts dropping some word and all of a sudden she becomes religious and then he takes her from a sinner to religious to a and shows her her predestination in the plan of almighty God that she's a very first one that he shows himself to that Jesus proves that he's the word word of God that he could discern the thoughts and just like he said it in Luke 17:30 that so shall it be in the days of the son of man when he begins to reveal the secrets of the heart to think what he was doing right there just like with the boys on the road to AAS and they're walking down there and their eyes are closed they don't understand what's going on and all of a sudden it's more than an oror that's walking with him down a dusty road this is more than just a an ordinary man but Elohim is in flesh but they don't recognize who this is sometimes you're sitting in a service and you don't understand who's talking to you you don't you just hear the words but all of a sudden I love what the prophet said he said what does he do to your eyes what did he do to your eyes he did something to them boys' eyes so that they could see that that was Jesus what is he done in your day what has he done right here with your eyes so that you could see that this is more than just a prophet's message you could see that this is more than just Malachi 4 but you could see this is Revelations 10 what did he do with your eyes so that you could see what's he done he showed us who he is I love how the prophet would tell it in a church age book how that the unveiling the unveiling of a scul culture that he literally pulls it off so that the per person could see it clearly right in front of them I want you to know that in this hour everything has been pulled off so that this body move can say that there is nothing that is hindering them there is nothing that is hidden from them but they could literally stand right there they could stand right there and could say I'd say what what happened to our eyes in this generation it allowed us to see a message a message that separated us a message to come out of her my people a message that would say come out repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ just like it did with faithful Abraham that voice separated him it separated him from everything that he loved everything that he knew and Abraham his whole entire experience was was hanging on the voice that was leading him it led him away from his father it led him away from his homeland the prophet said it like this God separated us from all the dead religions he I'm speaking across a nation now that all the dead Creeds into what he said he separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day he said Pentecostals dried up and died like Luther and Wesley and the rest of them and Abraham everywhere he went brother Jimmy he was walking and he was hanging on the word of God he was looking to the one that was leading him and Abraham he goes through the stages of Grace showing God showing us through his life the outline that a Believer has to walk this way they have to go through Genesis 12 they have to go through sanctification they have to go through Genesis 15 of sanctification let me say it like this when he was standing there in sanctification he was saying is this all you've got that's what he was saying to him God is this all you got maybe I'm not reading out of the same Bible y'all reading out of that's literally what he was saying said Lord all that's in my house is elaser is he my Heir and God said that's not all I've got for you Abraham I've got something more for you that your eyes can behold and he takes him not not only there but he literally takes him to Genesis 17 to a spot of being filled with the Holy Ghost and adopted and place as a Son of God that's what William Brandon would say in Abraham's Grace Covenant he' said that he justified him Sanctified him by the blood of Christ he gave him his own life in 17th chapter and the baptism of the Holy Ghost now what comes next some of you Bible scholars it's the placing of a son he stands there he stands there in Genesis 17 and he says unto him I am the almighty God you see what you thought that you was powerful enough but he says I am your sufficiency Abraham was hanging on to every word that elhad was speaking unto him and he literally nursed his new body out of them promises that I am enough you might be going through LC and say is this message enough and God says I am Eli I am more I am more than enough you don't have to wonder about you don't have to feed on YouTube you don't have to feed on Creeds you don't have to feed on some watered down gospel out there but I am your satisfying portion it was enough for Abraham it was enough for him brother Randall that he could lean his head over on the bosom of elshad and he could pull a body out of him that he didn't know nothing about and he literally pulled on him and pulled out a body change I love what the prophet said in Jehovah Gyra he said while we're waiting and resting in your faith take God's promise I believe you Lord you promis to give me the baptism of the Holy Spirit and I'm resting in your faith my faith that I have in you I'm drawing from my source my resource for my health from your resource the word The man shall not live by bread alone but by every but out of the bosom of God shall he nurse his strength every word that comes out of the mouth of God shall he receive strength as he comes from the mouth of God so Abraham was hanging on it every promise that was promise to the seedline of Abraham was hinging on El Shad ey let me put it in aspect to you your body change is hinging on this message come on somebody you getting out of the message you're in is hinging on this message come on somebody when I was out in the world I studied religion I looked at it but it had no power it had no power to save me I hate to take you down that road but drugs didn't had no power in it alcohol had no power in it things of the world had no power in it but this message both Old and New Testament the message had the ability to put us in position maybe I'm preaching on one person but this message has the ability to change your situation around Eddie walr knew it when she was dying with cancer I had cancer of the heart and she told her husband even if I die put me in that line she was hanging on the word come on come on Florence n Andale come on come on you're without hope doctors done gave you up Cancer's eating you up and you look like a skeleton but there's a messenger in the land if I can just get to him and he can get to me I know that I live she said oh anoint me for death William brandham he said I didn't come here to anoint you for death I come here to anoint you for life Edie walop was hanging she was hanging she was hanging on it Florence Nightingale was hanging on It come on somebody Congressman Upshaw was hanging on it Georgie Carter was hanging on it hanging on that word even your Prophet had a vision that he was going to have a son and he was going to call his name Joseph and this one came and that one came and people mocked him they made fun of him said maybe the Lord meant you call him Josephine he said no but God gave me a promise that he call his son his name's Joseph what was it William Brandon wasn't hanging on his emotion William Bram wasn't hanging upon his thoughts he was hanging on thus saith the Lord let me tell you something if you're going to hang your soul on something hang it on thus sayith the Lord notice he goes to Genesis 18 he goes to Genesis 18 and he steps into a position his whole life is built on this message his whole life is hanging on the word his whole life is hanging on it he's waiting for these moments and all of a sudden hello him becomes flesh he becomes flesh he starts walking down a dusty road he starts picking up some elements he starts picking up some elements and he picks up potash and picks up calcium he picks up this and he picks up that and all of a sudden it blows himself abide and he steps into it because Elohim was wanting to take on flesh because he was wanting to go by Abraham's house to have some fellowship with his prophet he had talked to him with voice he had talked to him in Vision but now it was time for Elohim to fellowship with Abraham and he's sitting there and he's having a conversation he says I am the almighty God I am the almighty God and I'm not going to I'm not going to leave you in that condition but I'm going to change your name from Abram to Abraham and Abraham recognized when he put H in his name he wasn't just putting an extra letter there he was putting Grace he was putting power he was putting anointing in his life what was it he changed his name from Abram to Abraham which means a father of many nations Abram in his condition could not produce but he wasn't hanging on his own self he was hanging on Elohim and Elohim is at his tent door and he starts having a conversation with him and notice what Abraham calls him he calls him Elohim because he recognized the same one that he's been SP speaking to that he's been talking to this is him he's in flesh he understands and all of a sudden he gets busy about work he's got to make a sacrifice he's got to make all these things ready he's got to get he's got to get everything just right because s MDC mzc deserves everything that you got he deserves the best that you got he deserves the best sacrifice that you got that's why I don't believe that you ought to come to church haphazardly but I believe that you ought to get prayed up filled up and anointed by the holy spirit before you walk in them doors back there I believe that you ought to offer God a sacrifice of praise and I believe it ought to be your best and Abraham Abraham is doing his work but when Abraham in he's sitting there and he says Abraham where is thy wife Sarah he does not call him Abram he calls him Abraham and the prophet catches it under the revealing of the Seven Seals that he recognized this was him this was him I've called him that I've wored him before but I'm not just talking to anybody but I'm talking to Elohim elohim's talking back to me he having a conversation with me that everything that I've trusted in I've waited for is right here before me if I could express this to you that in this room is Elohim the self-existing one the one that holds a power when Satan says you're not enough God says I am enough Jesus Hallelujah he called him all sufficient he identified his characteristics Abraham identified him as God Abraham identified him as Elohim what do you identify with has he been God to you has he been your sustainer has he been your way maker has he been your promisee keeper Abraham identified him as Elohim and Elohim begin to show him the very signs how I love what the prophet said how did a Abraham recognize that how did Abraham recognize that now you know where you've been in your life you know the journey that you've been down Abraham knows the journey he said but how did he recognize how did Abraham recognize that now Abram called him Elohim how many knows that true Bible readers yes sir Elohim is all sufficient one why did he call him Elohim because he could do discern the thoughts that was in his heart now you know you know you know that's the truth you know that brother Ron ain't just brother Ron's more you recognize when brother Ron and brother Matthew and brother William and a man of God Gets behind the pulpit and he starts operating outside of his flesh but the supernatural element starts operating you recognize who it is how did Abraham recognize that come on little Brian how do we recognize this Messiah sign in this generation is because he could discern the very thoughts and intense a heart he could stand there and it was a power of indication that he could stand there turn his back to the crowd and say I see this sister she's sitting back there got a bladder Condition it's causes turmoil on the inside of her but thus sayith the Lord Thou Art healed what was it it was that same MDC that was at the tent door I'm going to preach to you just for a minute Satan has lied to you he's told you me cader day can't coming he's told you you're not powerful enough but I want to rec I want you to recognize that MDC is at your door Satan didn't have enough Satan didn't have enough to keep MDC from running by Abraham's way he had every Power out there he had every intention of stopping that body from producing Isaac but he didn't have enough come on little bride that same demon power that has attacked you has not enough authority to stop the Church of the Living God [Applause] hallelujah when Jesus was standing there he had the same abilities he proved it was Elohim and flesh again he proved it was John 14 he proved he was John 15 he proved he was Elohim in the flesh it's the same power it's the same anointing now I want to go further I want to go further cuz I know you're hanging on this I know you're hanging on this I know you got your soul hanging on this message come on somebody I didn't give my life up for this message for nothing come on somebody I ain't just entertained I ain't just entertained myself but I believe that we have entertained strangers on a we here tonight I believe I believe that I gave my message I gave my heart to this message I gave my all to this message I gave my everything to this message I didn't do that without cause come on somebody I didn't give up going to my girls birthday gifts birthday parties and going to their events just for nothing but I gave up all of that to show that there's a power when you was entertaining the rest of the world I was studying for you I was looking for overcoming power for you you I didn't give up all of that so that you can miss a Rapture I gave it all I gave him my everything these men of God have [Applause] studied they've looked into the mind of God because your situation is hanging on this word what if I could tell you your situation could change by tonight's message come on somebody what if I had the power to tell you that you can walk out of here free tonight by tonight's message is it worth my studies is it worth my energies then let's put all behind it Jesus didn't leave it on himself sister Katie he didn't leave it on himself he left you a work to do he said the works that I do shall you do also and Greater Works than need shall you do because I go unto my father he said these words specifically because he knew that you would believe it he said if you abide in me and my words abide and you you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you can a man can a man do that yes he can a Son of God can you have the ability to speak to a mountain you've got the ability to speak to situations you've got the ability it ain't just William Brandon's promise it ain't just Jesus's promise but when Jesus is standing there in Mark 11 and 22 it says have faith in God speak to this mountain and it'll be moved from here to Yonder he didn't say if I say it he said if you said it I believe with every F of my being that the bride is hanging you feel what I'm feeling are you under are you on the same level as I am then I believe that I wish you could see what I see I see victory over your life Hallelujah come on hadie R was sitting right there when William brandom started saying these words that a super anointing swept down through those doors swept down through those woods and as she's sitting there she's hanging on those words Hallelujah she's hanging she's hanging on those words all of a sudden the prophet said a super anointing swept into her room swept into the room and said tell her that she's found Grace in the sight of almighty God she was hanging on it her soul was hanging on it I tell you this message has got the power to take prodal and bring them to their knees I tell you this message has got the power to turn little fishes that have been dead and turn them back to life again I tell you this message has got the power to speak the storms and let them roll out of existence it's got the power to speak the tumors and make them dissolve in a moment this message has got the power to create squirrels but it's got more than that it's got the ability for you to walk out there and take the very power away from Satan Hallelujah hey you went through some trials you tried to do it on your own you tried to manifest it in your own flesh but I am your everything I am your all I'm going to read this quote to you cuz I don't want you to miss [Music] it and question answers he said it's not outside SE it's not this flesh he said see taste feel smelling here it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here inside of that that is a person that cannot die and the person that the New Life Starts from and from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life so potentially it's in here and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word and the same thing is the translation of the Bride will be the same thing that word that's in you the body will materialize around that word as the same thing that it did by Sarah when that old body that she had the first body it had to be changed in order to produce a son but the body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed to the same to receive the Sun Ain't no wonder the Bride of Jesus Christ stays in hunger ain't no wonder she stays thirsty it's because she's feeding on the unfailing body word that word that's in you your body will materialize around it now I dropped that in seed form but we're going to watch it in materialization what am I saying to you I'm saying that literally by the preaching of the word that you begin to put your body in position for a body change just like a little seed as it comes to the bedding grounds of its mothers and father it grabs a hold of a certain area and it's starts taking life and all of a sudden a body starts forming around it that's why William Brandon was saying things that are to be he said Sail on top of sale on top of sell has begin to build a word born bride I want to tell that devil that's lied to you cuz I feel him in the room you've been hanging on to the wrong people Satan you have been hanging on to the wrong people we are just the kind of people that will produ a body change because this message that we're holding on to has put us in position maybe you're like Abraham and you waited for it and you waited for it and you waited for it but I'm going to drop it in the illustration there was a I know I probably ain't saying this right but over over in France there's a great Museum of Art that's called the Luth there is where the Mona Lisa is held at all these fine pieces of art there in that in that uh in that museum there's a piece of art that's called checkmate and it is the devil playing chess against a man and the devil has one there was a group of students that come from a college
