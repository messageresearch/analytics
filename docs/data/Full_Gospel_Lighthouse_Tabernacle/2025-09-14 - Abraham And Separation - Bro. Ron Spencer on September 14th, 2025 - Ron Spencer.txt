Y'all pray for us. I recruited my buddy here at the last moment. We have not practiced. So if this goes really bad, I take full responsibility. It was not his fault. It's a good thing he's pointing at me. So So hopefully it'll go all right. He's a really good singer and a really great guy. I love him to death and so I know he'll he'll bring me up a little bit. So u I ask y'all to continue to pray for Wanda. She's doing well. Um her numbers are looking good. Um &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. She's got two more she's got to get through and she keeps counting the days down because it's getting pretty rough on her. So, but she's she's been strong. So, y'all continue to pray for her and we'll get through this. [Music] As they gamble for the road before war, they chose the worldly trail without thinking about eternity as the soldiers drove the nails. Will we learn from what they done or make the same mistake? Me or the world, my child, which one will you take? Cuz I'll take Jesus. I'll take Jesus. [Music] I've tried these worldly pleasures and they fail. &gt;&gt; They fail. [Music] &gt;&gt; When you see the gates of heaven, you'll hear the master say, "It's me or the world, my child. Which one will you take? [Music] &gt;&gt; As the page of my life have turned and time has rolled away. See the greatest things that I've done are not going to matter on that day. &gt;&gt; Amen. is all my earthly treasure that I have laid away. Listen, they're not going to mean just a memory. And then you'll hear me say, "Cuz I'll take Jesus." Cuz I'll take Jesus. [Music] I've tried those worldly pleasures and they fail. When you see the gates of heaven and hear the master say it's me or the world, my child, which one will you take? For it's me all the world, my child, which one will you take? [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus told a story one day about some sand and rock and grain and about two houses and a storm that came. The sand couldn't stand the rain but the house on the rock remained. One day a Pharisee to Jesus brought a woman in adultery caught. That man walked away in the sand, condemned, but the woman's guilt was gone. [Music] Jesus stood for sinners that no one else would stand for. Then he stood at Calvary when we thought he could stand no more. [Music] In the days after Jesus had gone away, a man named Steven was full of faith. But because of men who were full of hate, he went on trial for his faith. [Music] And he fearlessly preached about the days of when the prophets their fathers slain, and how they all rejected the Holy Ghost. even gave his life that day. And that's why we remember his name. Oh, what will you be remembered for? Did you take a stand when you thought you could stand no more? Are you in the rock or in the sand? What will you be remembered for? [Music] All Joshua, Caleb, and Abraham, Enoch, David, Esther, Raab. If the list goes on, will you find your name there? Oh, what will you be remembered for? Are you in the rock or in the sand? Don't forget that God sent us a man. And in the storm, he's there to help you stand. Are you in the rock or in the sand? Oh, don't forget that God sent us a man. And when they've met you, will the world know? What will you be remembered for? Oh, what will you be remembered for? Did you take a stand when you thought you could stand no more? Are you in the rock or in the sand? What will you be remembered for? [Music] Oh, what will you be remembered for? [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Praise the Lord. Ain't it wonderful to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; And that's a wonderful thing to be remembered for in this life. My goodness, didn't you appreciate those duets this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; I I thought Brother Matthew, Sister Cassie had their work cut out for them, but they did all right following up, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want to as we get ready to change order of the service and invite Brother Ron to come this morning. We want to make you aware that next weekend, uh, Brother Joe Adams will be here with us, him and his family. So, we want to be remembering that. And, uh, right now he's missionaring over in, uh, Mexico. So, pray God blesses them. Amen. Let's just stand this morning. Uh, Kia G, that's what your mercy did for me. I was hopeless. I knew I was lost. I was hopeless. I knew I was lost. Death and darkness were my only songs. I needed someone to come rescue me. Your mercy heard my plea. Oh Lord, you found me. You healed me. You called me from the grave. You gave me your real love. I thank you, Jesus. You wash my sins away. And now I'm living like I'm forgi. You came and set me free. And that's what your mercy did for me. He gave me beauty for my guilty saints. And now I'm living day to day by his grace. So excuse me if I can't contain my praise cuz I know that I I've been changed. But Lord, you found me. You heal me. You call me from the grave. You gave me your real look. Thank you, Jesus. You wash my sins away. And now I'm living like I'm forgi. You came and set me free. And that's what your mercy did for me. Aren't you thankful for his mercy? And that's what your mercy did for me.

Aren't you thankful for his love and his peace that passes all understanding? Aren't you thankful for a God that'll forgive you when you fall? And aren't you thankful that he's there to keep you from falling? I say, oh God, pour your mercy out upon us today. Come in a very specific and powerful way this morning as we dedicate this service unto the Lord. Maybe you just want to sit there and lift your hands up to the Lord and say, "God, I need you more today than I ever have before. And I just want to reach out and touch you today. I want you to come by my way and let the winds of the Holy Ghost get in this service and brush over us. Oh God, we dedicate this day to you. Oh God, may you come and anoint our brother Ron in a very special way. And that's what your mercy did for me and every morning. Mercy will restore me. I I will proclaim [Music] and even the words fall before me. I will proclaim. Lord, you found me. You heal me. You call me from the grave. You came in your real love. Thank you, Jesus. You wash my sins away. Now I'm living like I'm forgi. Hallelu. And that's what your mercy did for me. And that's what your mercy did for me. Thank you, Lord. And that's what your mercy did for me. Lord God Almighty, you are clotheing man. to sleep. The heavens declare your wonderers. You are great and do marvelous things. For you alone are my God. [Music] There is no one else who like you.

[Music] [Applause] You are praise you [Music] my king. &gt;&gt; Is he your king this morning? &gt;&gt; He's not the Lord to you unless you make him &gt;&gt; your Lord. I'm thankful this morning that we can come and worship the Lord here today and and say he's my God &gt;&gt; and there's nobody like him. You know, one service can change our lives. One &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One service changed my life. I'd been in service all my life to that age, but one service changed my life. Maybe today might be your service. If you're expecting that today, won't you just ask him, "Come near to me today." Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, you're so great and you're so wonderful. You fill all time, space, and eternity. and you know how just to speak to us. I can only imagine how it was when you stood there those days and spoke the biatitudes. [Music] No way for those people to realize how great a moment that they was in. Now, Father, today we're we're just so on the edge of eternity. Help us today, Lord, to step into the realm to where you can speak to us. Now, Father, I ask you to anoint these lips and I ask you to anoint every heart in this building. Lord, this great sickness among us, I pray that you would touch them. Lord, you're the most powerful and you can so gently touch our lives. Come and touch us today. Lord, if there would one be here that don't know you, may before the end of this day, they come to know you as their personal savior in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. Turn to your neighbor and say, "Good to be in the house of the Lord with you." And amen. Ain't he wonderful? &gt;&gt; He's just wonderful, isn't he? Amen. So good to see each and every one of you. And Amen. So I'd like to go out and have dinner with you and each we'd sit and talk about our families and our cars. I like that car. I like that. I like that really well. I had one like that when I was a boy. That's how I got Connie. Hallelujah. So good. So today, instead of going out to eat at the table, I want to I want you to pull up yourself to the table today. And we're all friends and family here. And I certainly hope nobody's an enemy. But we're we're we're certainly so love you with all of our hearts. And we're living in very very close times to eternity. And &gt;&gt; if you can't see it, uh, just open your eyes just a little bit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this week, a very powerful man was killed. And brother, his name was Charlie Kirk. And Andrew said much about him last night. And I just want to remind you, the scripture talks about two prophets being killed in the streets of Israel. And uh that was thousands of years ago. It talked about it. But you watched a man get killed, a very righteous man &gt;&gt; get killed in the streets &gt;&gt; and hated because he believed in righteousness and &gt;&gt; he believed in and and and he didn't have the message. But I believe there's a place for him somewhere. So &gt;&gt; if the enemy could do that, that same enemy will hate those two prophets, &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah. &gt;&gt; And saying this, the scripture says that they'll be killed in the streets and the whole world will witness it. &gt;&gt; Hey, and the prophets, they didn't they didn't know about internet or video or all over the world, but there's cameras everywhere now. And so and so we realize that we're living in the time when everything is being so fulfilled from week to week to week. And &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll turn with me to Genesis chapter 12 and verse one. I want to speak to you on a very simple thought, but it's a very powerful thought. I want to talk to you about Abraham and separation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 12 and verse one. Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee. And I will make thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed. And Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him. And Lot went with him. And Abram was 705 years old when he departed out of Haran. You may be seated. Brother Bram says, "Look at a separation going into a strange land and you know nothing about it." That's Christianity. Separating from the things of the world because God has called you going into another land to dwell among people that you know nothing about. Amen. &gt;&gt; To be a pilgrim. And when I think of it, I can just hardly hold myself. Pilgrim strangers. Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8. And this is the Hall of Fame chapter. And by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place that which he was that should after receive for an inheritance obeyed. That's a powerful word. &gt;&gt; Obeyed. And he went out, not knowing whether he went. And by faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, their heirs with him of the same promise. Notice notice what he his purpose was. He looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; Why would he look for it? He met the king. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when he was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised. Notice it doesn't say that she doubted, she laughed. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Thank you. God in the this Hebrews 11, look past all of the human frailties. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that God can look at you like that? &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; it doesn't just say anything about Abram Abraham rolling on the ground laughing at God. Right. &gt;&gt; Therefore, spring there even to one and him as a good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky and the multitude, and as the sand that which is by the seashore innumerable. These all died in faith, not having received the promise, but having seen them aar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they say un such things, declare plainly, that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, &gt;&gt; a heavenly. Wherefore God is not ashamed to be their God, for he hath prepared for them a city. And by faith Abraham when he was tried, he he offered Isaac and he had received the promises and offered up his only begotten son. Of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called, accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from whence also he received him in figure. And may we all say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham is the father of the faith. I think it's interesting that God calls Abram Abraham his name 300 times and 300 different scriptures. And then there's innumerable amount of scriptures that goes with those scriptures. And there's just chapter after chapter, book after book on the life of Abraham. So it's an important part for us. &gt;&gt; Give you an idea. We hear about Shamgar. Shamgar kills 600 Philistines. &gt;&gt; One scripture. &gt;&gt; It's true. &gt;&gt; One scripture. There was a name man named Antipus. Antipus is a overcomer. Lived amongst a a place of the seat of Satan is what it said. And he overcame in the darkest place that he could live. One scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I'm my name. It's not in the scriptures. Not important." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not important. But you can see yourself &gt;&gt; in the scriptures. Now, I want you to understand some of the most difficult things that Abram would have to do and Abraham would have to do is separate. &gt;&gt; Separation's difficult. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand Abram Abraham didn't call himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's a light like you and I. We didn't call oursel. &gt;&gt; How did we get here? There was something on the inside of us that was not satisfied with where we were. &gt;&gt; Maybe you were sitting in a church and you were hearing all different kinds of sermons from this to that and this to that. Maybe under laws, maybe under dictates, maybe under strange religions. But God be to deal with you. &gt;&gt; And in his dealing, he placed a hunger in your heart. There's got to be more. &gt;&gt; There's got to be more. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to remember where Abraham lived, the cities that he lived in, God didn't speak to them, &gt;&gt; but he spoke to one man. &gt;&gt; Listen, some of his family would go with him. &gt;&gt; We understand that. But he only spoke to one man. didn't speak to his wife. He spoke to one man. &gt;&gt; God called Abraham. And I want you to understand it must have been a difficult thing. &gt;&gt; It's difficult to separate. I I I I feel for all of us that have to separate from different things. We separate from different kinds of religions. We separate from jobs. We separate from old habits. Sometimes we have to separate from family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Listen. As for me, in my house, we're going to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's our plan. Our our home is our sanctuary. And I want you to understand, we don't want the world to contaminate that sanctuary. &gt;&gt; That's right. So Abraham has to separate from all of these things. God called him, but Abraham had to separate. &gt;&gt; God don't do it everything for you. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; There's some things that you've got to overcome. &gt;&gt; Now, many of us had habits in our life or situations in our life and we had to lay it down. Are you with me? We had to leave it behind. Listen, there's a lot of things we're going to leave here. &gt;&gt; Now, separation causes us to have to leave our comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody enjoys a certain comfort zone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We enjoy a certain things in our life and comfort zone. And God calls us out from that. &gt;&gt; He separates us from that. Now, I want you to just think about this. Maybe maybe I'll just share this part. Brother Andrew was speaking on the Holy Ghost last night. Wasn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; You know, and maybe we come in our life and I'll just share some of my personal experience. Brother Bram shares just thousands of quotes on the Holy Ghost. But you know, you're seeking the Holy Ghost and you know that you can't live it without it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know I can't live this life on my own. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, I I could live right if you come and live with me." &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't need that because you got God. &gt;&gt; You got way above way above my pay grade. You got God with you. That's right. &gt;&gt; And so we need the life of God. We don't need a a bunch of loss. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We don't want to just live right here in church. &gt;&gt; And and put on a different cloak on Monday morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We need the personal life of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; living on the inside of us. &gt;&gt; Abraham would want that that circumcision. He would want that that change in his life. for him to be different. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand every one of us have different experience. &gt;&gt; We can't mark our experience by by another. God gives you like your eyes and your fingerprints is a is a different signature about you. &gt;&gt; Nobody else is like you. &gt;&gt; Every one of us, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; Gets a different experience with the personal life of Jesus Christ. That's right. &gt;&gt; Some of us shout. Some of us dance. Some of us cry. &gt;&gt; Some of us do different things. &gt;&gt; Many sensations. You heard brother Wayne talk about seeing the pillar of fire coming across the platform to him while he was down at the altar. &gt;&gt; Maybe nobody else on the earth has ever had that experience. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say this to you. You're not going to have lightning hit you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I had lightning hit me. Didn't like it. Don't want it to ever happen again. &gt;&gt; But I didn't receive the Holy Ghost with the lightning strike. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Some of it will come immediately. Some you're going to have to tarry for it. &gt;&gt; And in the taring for the Holy Ghost, you just keep praying. You just keep dying out to your flesh. &gt;&gt; You just keep marching onward. &gt;&gt; You just keep serving the Lord. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Don't ever get to a part to where God don't love me. I can't get it. I'm just never going. Don't let the devil beat you around the stick. You have a desire for the Holy Ghost. That only tells you there's a Holy Ghost for you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That only tells you there's a Holy Ghost for you. &gt;&gt; You've repented. You've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You're a candidate for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And it's a promise to you. &gt;&gt; Now listen, you don't have to beg for it. You don't have to beg God for it. It's a gift. &gt;&gt; So you just thank him for it. &gt;&gt; So in your thanksgiving, are you with me now? Season your prayer with thanksgiving. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to thank God for something that you don't have. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You got to thank him for things that you don't have because the potential is there for you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just share this to you. Your your young ones here. Every time, and I'll just ask you, you can raise your hand. You've been in a room or you've been in your car and you feel a warm presence just come in. It's like somebody walked in the room. How many's ever had that experience? You've just been maybe alone and you just feel that warm presence. Well, let me just share this with you. Every time he comes, no matter your age, no matter how long you've been a Christian, while he is there, you have a conversation with him. Father, I need more of you. &gt;&gt; I need more of you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You need to You need to get rid of something. You need to repent of something. Right. There's a good time. &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, but brother Ron, I'm gonna have to tell him a thought. He already knows. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me give you a secret. God already knows all your nonsense. &gt;&gt; But in spite of your nonsense, he still loves you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So ask him, feel my life. Well, brother, I got the Holy Ghost in 1982. Well, let me just say this. You there's more for you today. &gt;&gt; I like iced tea. But I want you to understand my cup runs out. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to pour some more in. Are you with me? We heard about him last night making the jug and putting a hand on it. Sometimes you got to put your hand on it. Get your get your cup filled back up. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now let me just share this with you. Maybe your friends are not wanting this, but that's okay. Everybody's a free moral agency. But just because your friends don't want to go, you got to go. &gt;&gt; God put something in you, you got to separate. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; I let me just explain something to you. Who is my friends? &gt;&gt; Come on. who is really my friends. We all have to work with people. I've been in business since I was 13 years old. We always have to work with people of the world. &gt;&gt; We got friends there that we call friends or partners or or alliances in business. &gt;&gt; We've all got different things that we've got going on. But that don't make them your eternal friends. Are you with me? Or your eternal associates. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; What's the difference, brother Ron? If they're drawing you heavenward &gt;&gt; and you're both on the same path, &gt;&gt; and you both love the Lord Jesus and the message of the hour, &gt;&gt; that's a good idea that they're a friend. But if you've got a friend that's a drug head, &gt;&gt; a friend that never wants to go to church or does not want to serve God and listen to all kind of music, &gt;&gt; there must come a separation in your life. [Applause] Now you say, "Well, brother Ron, there's things in my life." I'm laying all all this in before I can go any further. There's things in my life that's there in my DNA that that's there that I have to struggle with. I I I let me just let me just talk to you a moment. God is the potter. God is the potter. &gt;&gt; We are the clay. &gt;&gt; Whether you realize it or not, we're still on the spinning wheel. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We're still on the spinning wheel. God's not going to change your character in the rapture. &gt;&gt; He's got to do it right here. Cuz there's not going to be a liar there or a cheater there or a robber there. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Or a lustful demon there. There's not going to be none of that in heaven. &gt;&gt; Because it if it is there, it ain't heaven. &gt;&gt; There not going to be no blue-haired people there. All right. &gt;&gt; It will not be Sodom there. &gt;&gt; It will not be Sodom there. &gt;&gt; Let me let me I'm sorry. Let me just go back to you. Your minds are perpetually social media is constantly after you. &gt;&gt; Constantly sending you images and constantly sending you like, dislike. Friends, be my friend. Be my friend. Let me let me just say this to you real quickly. So you said, "Brother Ron, I want you to be my friend. I don't have Facebook &gt;&gt; and I don't have all of the other stuff. So if you want a friend request from me, ah, I'm being your friend right now. [Applause] So, so when you see friends send you pictures and they're in a bathing suit, don't like it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Simply don't like it cuz that says I approve. &gt;&gt; And they're in their booty shorts. don't like it. &gt;&gt; Or if they're a girlfriend and they're a girl, don't like it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And it's so easy to be caught up. &gt;&gt; So easy to be caught up with this laying deceitful age. &gt;&gt; That's free. It wasn't in my notes, but there we are. &gt;&gt; So, God takes us and we're on the molding wheel. Brother Brandham was a very honest man with us. He would talk to us about his nervousness. Brother B was nervous from a little bitty boy to to even to his death. And he was very he was very quick to tell us about his complexes. I thought she was preaching on Abraham. I am. &gt;&gt; I am. Abraham had complexes. He had he had things in his life. Well, quickly tell me, brother Ron, that Abraham had a didn't have a complex or had a complex. Okay. They go to Greer and the the the the king and Greer wants his wife. And notice what he says. Don't tell him &gt;&gt; you're my wife. &gt;&gt; Tell him you're my sister. Right. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Brother Brandham said he was saving his own skin. &gt;&gt; So Abraham had complexes. &gt;&gt; So we're built in a certain way that we're going to have to battle our self. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, brother Ron, why does God in our supernatural birth don't change the complex of our life?" It's because God wants the bell to sound a certain way &gt;&gt; and he puts certain elements in your life to keep you from getting bigheaded &gt;&gt; and thinking you're so special. There's nobody like you and the world couldn't exist unless it was revolving around you. I got news for you, sweetheart. Come on. &gt;&gt; The world don't revolve around me. It revolves around the sun. [Applause] &gt;&gt; My dad had the complex or my dad had the thought. You ever heard that song rainy night in Georgia? It must be raining all over the world. Well, my dad thought if it was raining at his house. You might know somebody like that. But if it was raining at his house, it ought to be raining all over the world. &gt;&gt; I got a reason for saying this. Just because a cloud was over his house &gt;&gt; and was pouring out, &gt;&gt; thank God for the rain. But not necessarily was it raining at my house. &gt;&gt; So sweetheart, just because there's a cloud of depression over you don't mean it over top of me. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you were kind of off the scripture. Okay. 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and I want to read this for you. It is not expedient for me to be doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. This is Paul now. I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago. Whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body, I cannot tell. God knoweth such one caught up into the third heaven. I knew such a man. Whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell. God knoweth. Notice Paul was not in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was up to God. &gt;&gt; How that he was caught up into the paradise and heard unspeakable words which is not lawful for a man to utter. Of such a one of such a one will I glory. Yet of myself I will not glory. but in my infirmities. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool. For I will say the truth, but now I forbear. Lest, notice these words. Let's just read this together. It's too good to leave it alone. Lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me. Let's go ahead and read the next verse. Unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should get exalted above measure. I don't like myself. Well, hello. &gt;&gt; I'd like to be taller. But it wasn't in my DNA cards. So, lest I get exalted in my flesh above me, this is a prophet. This is the guy that's going to write 14 books of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Phenomenal words is going to come through his preaching. You talk about miracles above measure. And yet there was given him a thorn in the flesh &gt;&gt; to keep him. God knows how to keep us all humble. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. We're We're all We're all humans here. &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne told us about angels that had wings. He said, "Huge wings." And and what an honor that would have been to see. &gt;&gt; But we don't have a wing department here. So, Brother Brandham was brother Brandham was standing. He had people that was around him, too. And he was standing shaking people's hands as they were going out of the service. And they were telling him, "What a great service. What a great sermon. What a great sermon. What a great sermon." And he was thanking them and thanking them and and he was thanking them and and you know, you know, it made him happy to hear it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so and so and so a man was standing beside him and he rebuked Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; He rebuked Brother Brand. Can you imagine rebuking Brother Brand standing in the in the judgment line and you're there because you rebuked the prophet. And so and Brother Brandham looked at I I think it's a I think it's so sharp of an answer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He looked at him. He said, "There's a difference between you and I. I'm honest and you're not. You're talking about a pin and a balloon." &gt;&gt; I'm honest and you're not. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand, Brother Brandham was a man like me and you. &gt;&gt; He he he loved he loved people. &gt;&gt; He loved our sisters. And yet, he was termed a woman hater. Come on. &gt;&gt; The world wanted to determine that. They termed Elijah a woman hater. They'll turn the Elijah in Israel a woman hater. &gt;&gt; They will. But Brother Brandham loved you sisters. And he put you on a pinnacle. Said you'll actually get a greater reward than us men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham didn't didn't go down and push women down. He lifted them up. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're queens. You're the pastor of the home. &gt;&gt; You have a quality about you &gt;&gt; in all of that that he heard all of that. And yet there was groups of people that wanted to offer brother Bram millions of dollars to preach in their circle. &gt;&gt; But they had a they had a a little &gt;&gt; a little rope on it. And you're going to have to quit preaching against those women. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to you put too much emphasis on on on baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You know, you he said he said, "You just need to give them teach us some algebra." and he and qu just easily says, "How can I teach you algebra when you don't even know your ABCs?" &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham wasn't a rich man. &gt;&gt; He was not a rich man. Voice of God's rich, but brother Brandham wasn't rich. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a poor guy. There was many of his hunting trips that he goes on that was sponsored. &gt;&gt; They took care of him. But I want you to understand I want you to understand brother Brandham could have used a million dollars. &gt;&gt; What an offer that it was. &gt;&gt; But it called for separation. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It comes with a cost. &gt;&gt; You think I've been rambling, but I've actually been going quite on my notes real well. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good. &gt;&gt; When it comes to separation, you must never go back. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When it comes to separation, you may in your heart of hearts or in your thoughts. Well, I miss that. What do you miss? If you were a smoker or if you were a drinker, you got more brain cells now than you had before. You definitely got more character than what you had before. And I know you got better friends than what you had before. Why would you want to go back? &gt;&gt; Why would you want to go back to the lifestyle of chasing the wrong kind of women &gt;&gt; when God gave you a good wife? &gt;&gt; I'm going to hit something solid here. Why would you going to want to go back to porn? when you got a godly wife &gt;&gt; that is a treasure in heaven. &gt;&gt; Why would you want to look at some one pervert on a you don't even know if that's a woman or a man? &gt;&gt; That's somebody's daughter. That's somebody else's wife. And you're sending your soul to hell &gt;&gt; for a lustful spirit that you're feeding. &gt;&gt; How do I get a spirit to die? Don't feed it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The best way to to keep a habit going in your life is just keep feeding that thing. when I worked at the Arsenal. One of my supervisors died this week and I thought about it. He's a wonderful fellow. I enjoyed 11 years with him and uh had a lot of conversations with him and I was asked was I going to go to his funeral. I gave it thought. I thought real quick. I'd rather be here preaching. &gt;&gt; Brother, didn't you like him? Didn't you love him? Sure I did. &gt;&gt; But we're headed two different places. [Music] So sometimes there comes separation in Romans chapter 4 and verse 16. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be of grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. As it is written, I have made thee a father of nations. I want you to understand it is that you have made yourself a father of nations. God did it &gt;&gt; before him who only he believed even God who quickenth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were. Notice this next verse. who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. What a powerful what a powerful scripture. Abraham did not know who he was. &gt;&gt; God had to lead him to who he was. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine the thoughts? Where are you going, Abraham? I don't know. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know. Well, show me a map. I I can't show you a map. I don't know what kind of a voice you listening to. The voice that's anchored in my heart &gt;&gt; that I know that voice is real. Why do you pass all of these churches to go to that church? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know it's real. &gt;&gt; It changed my life. &gt;&gt; It changed my life. Brother David, this changed your life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's sometimes you can't explain how it happened &gt;&gt; cuz it wasn't even you that wanted to be here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You may have been convinced to be here, but here you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I don't know, brother John Stemon. How many of you ever heard brother John Stemon's? Brother John was a he was quite a friend of mine. I became a bosom buddy to him. Brother Danny Steman's father, brother John absolutely hated this message with all his heart. I'm talking about everything in him hated this message. Well, so happened he had married one of the most precious sisters of this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And her mother had been a a lady that worked in a home for brother and sister Dao. her mother had cancer and so brother Brandham had came over to visit and and you know she's a Menanite and so you know she's you know kind of becoming acquainted with brother Brandham's ministry and and she's sitting behind a door and and just kind of listening and brother Brandham is speaking on the other side of the door to the people in the room and he starts telling a story. And in the story, he explains brother Danny's grandmother and the cancer that she's got. And in the story, she finds out he's talking about me and I'm not even in the room. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're sitting in a service and you realize, "Hey, he's talking about me." &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, he's talking about me. So her and her daughter come to become converted to the message of the hour. Saints John hated it. He would come and blow his horn outside the meet. Can you imagine how obnoxious that was? Our deacons would go nuts. Brother John took message books and throw them in the river. What happened? River dried up. &gt;&gt; You can't make this stuff up. &gt;&gt; Brother John moved her over and over again. And he moved into California. Got up in the mountains where he thought nobody. And Brother Brandham's down in the hill country. He's down He's down in the city preaching. And he said, "God's got some of my children up there in those mountains. [Applause] He moves her to Florida in Menanite country surrounded by Menanites. This should come, this comes to some some of you guys. You know, you're surrounded by Amish people. Don't worry, you're the light, &gt;&gt; brother. You're preaching on separation. Yeah, I am. I'm talking about you. You had to separate and it's painful. We had to separate and it's painful. &gt;&gt; He moves her to Florida. She's going to a baptismal service. I'm going to just tell you the best recolation recolleation I have. And so she says, "I'm going to a baptismal service." He gets so mad. They're living in a house that just has those circles. I always love those houses that got a circle. I got one now. Brother Jim took a door, put in a room, and now we got a circle that can run around that house. Every once in a while, I'll just take off, run, run around all the way around the house. Why? I don't know. Brother John got so mad. He kept making circles. And she's standing there and she's just praying. She's just a she's a queen of a lady. And she's standing there just praying and and one of the circles he stopped and said, "I'm going with you." &gt;&gt; She went, "Oh my Lord, he's going to be a disturbance." And he wound up at the baptismal service. And you know what he did? He walked right into that water and he got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You're talking about a separation. A guy that went polar opposite to preaching this message. He developed a sermon, a 60se secondond sermon. And in that 60 seconds, he would preach baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, salvation, and Malachi 4:5 and 6. And where he did it at was at a red light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I see some of these people sitting on the corner and they got help wanted or, you know, I'm I'm hungry or I'm all of this and I got a lot of doubts when he does that. &gt;&gt; But here's brother John Steammon standing on a corner and preaching to a captive audience. for 60 seconds and they would go through and then stop again and 60 seconds and they would go through and 60 seconds and they would go through. Did it work? Well, he got a son-in-law out of it. &gt;&gt; And Bill Hersburgger and and Tom Ber walked up to him and they're standing there listening to the sermon over and over and over again. Hey, they're Amish and Menite and they're standing there listening to this man. They don't know he came from that. They're standing there listening to this and they accepted the Lord. Brother Bill is was his son-in-law and an associate pastor now. And brother Tom Baler was just here sat right there. His wife had cancer, delivered, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Going to be here in January preaching for us. But God called for separation. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. God will get his own. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who are hope? believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations. Can you imagine once God calls him out, God speaks to him and he says, "Count in the sand." You can't count the sand. So the shall thy seed be. Count the stars. I can't count the stars. It's God's first Bible. I can't count them. So shall thy seed be. I was thinking about this morning. I just about had myself a shot and fit. There's going to be a day that Abraham's going to stand in the eternities. And for the first time, &gt;&gt; he saw it in potential &gt;&gt; and for the first time, he's going to see us all together. Maybe you're on the fence. Maybe you're on the internet and you're on the fence. You don't know if you can make it once in a You can't You can't see your own potential. You can't see where God's leading you. Don't you worry. You trust God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You trust God. God sees what's on the inside of you. Now, I'm not going to read it because I'm running out of time, but Abraham brings his father, and there comes a time where he has to separate from his father. I know that had to be difficult. There comes a time when God's dealing with him and speaking to him, and sacrifices are being made. Now God has changed his name from Abram to Abraham, breathed his own life inside of him, placed his own attributes. That's not today's sermon. But there comes a time that he has a a nephew whom he dearly loves that has been with him through the journey. I'll be really honest with you. When you walk with God, God will bless you. Let me let me just say some of you make some incredible sacrifices, but don't you worry, God pays his debt. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He pays his debt. There'll be a time that you can't afford gas in your car, but don't you worry, God pays his debt. &gt;&gt; Abram, when you read about Lot getting in trouble, he had 300 and some 300 and some male servants that went to fight He had 300 some employees and he started the journey by himself and God was now in the middle of a basically a desert place and he's being so blessed I have to have 300 and some employee males not counting the females and not counting the children and not counting the animals. Sometimes we get the idea that Abraham was out there and he was he was just he was mothed and he was just totally broke. That's not our God. &gt;&gt; You got the wrong picture of God. &gt;&gt; God says, "I will bless you." &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I'm not passing another offering plate here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God said, "I will bless you." You got to believe for it. And I want you to understand, you got to work for it. &gt;&gt; Two hands, two feet work. &gt;&gt; But there comes a time to where their independent herds became too great for the land. And to be honest with you, two can't walk together except they be agreed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he went to God. What must I do? God gave him instructions. Separate. And the instructions says if he chooses this way or he chooses that way. And I'm paraphrasing now. You go the other way. And there's going to be times in your life to where your closest closest is going to believe certain things. It's going to take them right out of the message. It's going to be difficult, but you simply got to walk away. &gt;&gt; So Lot They have a meeting, have a conference, and he says, "Let there be no strife among us. Let's don't don't Let's stop the strife. That's not eternal. Let's stop that. Let's stop that." And he said, "You choose which way you'll go, and I'll go the other way." Abraham was the Christian of it all. Now watch Lot. Brother Brandon says, "Lot looked at all the possibilities that was down in Sodom. Saw the wellwatered grass that was there. He saw all of those possib &gt;&gt; he never thought that those Sodom conditions would affect his home. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you allow a demon in and you don't realize there's seven worse that's coming. &gt;&gt; I can get by with this. Really? &gt;&gt; Other people get by with it, but they not may not be seen. Well, that you know the this church does it this way and they they wear they wear their shorts, they bob their hair, they they may not be &gt;&gt; good on a on by biblical terms, we know they're not &gt;&gt; we're not all headed the same way. &gt;&gt; So don't justify yourself by a picture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or somebody lowering the rules just because of their their lust or their willingness to let the bars down. &gt;&gt; And so Abraham let him go. That's when God really begin to bless Abraham. God would not come in physical form to Abraham until Lot left. &gt;&gt; Everybody following me? Now, here's where we're beginning to come to where we're at now. As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man. As it was in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man. When I hear brother Brandham preach souls now in prison, can you imagine if he would go to our local Walmart, &gt;&gt; what he saw in JC Penney reminded him of what was in hell. &gt;&gt; If the headlines that he would see of what we see on a a daily basis, he could see now being the messenger as a seer could realize where we're headed. He could see that we're headed over the ca cascades, not of the na niagra, but we're headed over the cascades of time and eternity. &gt;&gt; The end of the gentile dispensation. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, but we're going to be here forever. &gt;&gt; I was going to save this for another, but I might as well just drop a couple things right here. Have you watched the news this week at all? Russia says that we're already in World War II. &gt;&gt; Is this mic working? &gt;&gt; Russia and their prime minister and their military leader this week said, "We're already in World War II." &gt;&gt; Why should America be surprised when we went into Poland? I'm afraid too many people's got their head in the sand. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We are here, folks. &gt;&gt; We're here, folks. And I'm coming to an end. We're here, folks. &gt;&gt; God save America. I'm a I'm afraid. Brother Bram says you could put a George Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in every county &gt;&gt; and it wouldn't change it. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I don't know if he was right on that. Did you see Charlie Kirk get killed? a good man that was trying to speak righteousness and Bible principles and tried to do it the right way to our young people. &gt;&gt; He wasn't militant. He never he got mad. He never done all of those things. He was trying to bring righteousness to the colleges. He was trying to do different things. &gt;&gt; Listen, pray for his family. &gt;&gt; Got a lovely wife and lovely children. They didn't deserve to see their daddy. &gt;&gt; What did you do when you when you saw that take place this week? I cried. &gt;&gt; I personally cried cuz that tells me how close we are. &gt;&gt; They don't want clean television. &gt;&gt; They don't want clean movies. Come on. &gt;&gt; They don't want real righteous politicians. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They don't want it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't care where you're Democrat or Republican. &gt;&gt; I don't care. They're all rotten. &gt;&gt; That's right. [Applause] What does this mean, brother Ron? There's another separation coming. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 25, it talks about five wise and five foolish. &gt;&gt; Okay. The five wise had all which is the Holy Ghost in their lamp. So, were brother Ron, was brother Andrew's sermon so important? Listen, it's pivotal important &gt;&gt; that you have the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because it's your token. &gt;&gt; You cannot go in the rapture without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You can sit on this seat the rest of your life without the Holy Ghost. You'll not make a rapture. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; You can be in my family, but you've got to have the Holy Ghost. And listen, that's why we're preaching so hard because God's put us in our heart. We don't want to see one, &gt;&gt; not one lost. &gt;&gt; There was five, five wise. And at midnight, there was a cry made. And the five foolish was there as well. All of them slumbered and slept. The five foolish didn't have oil. The five foolish needed the Holy Ghost. I want you to understand those five foolish are not manhandled. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're good people. &gt;&gt; They're really good people. &gt;&gt; They're righteous people. &gt;&gt; They're powerful prayer warriors. They're in the kingdom, but they're not ready for rapture. Is this message important, Brother Ron? It's a ticket. &gt;&gt; It's a ticket. foolish screaming. Give us of your all. I got to have the life. I got to have the life. I got to have the life. Now, let me just say something to you. I'm going over time, but let me just say something. How horrible it's going to be for people that didn't find it convenient enough to come to church. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were too busy to come to church. &gt;&gt; But they're ushered into a tribulation period &gt;&gt; where the world is getting ready to go through a nightmare. &gt;&gt; A time that's like no other time. &gt;&gt; And to overcome in that day, you have to give your life. What a stark difference between coming to church and get the Holy Ghost on this side of the rapture. &gt;&gt; And having to live through a tribulation period, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; I knew such a people that lived such a life that in a moment, in the twinkle of an air, ah, they went to be with the Lord. And it spawned faith in my heart that I can overcome the beast and its system. I may have to give my life. I don't know what preacher will raise up in the tribulation period to help people that will get through that horrible time. &gt;&gt; But why wait? &gt;&gt; I want to ask you why wait, &gt;&gt; brother. But I I got to do this and I got to do that and I What excuse is there? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; What excuse is there to miss this messaging? &gt;&gt; I just don't have words to say it. What excuse is it to miss Christ? my wife, my husband, my children, and &gt;&gt; people at my job. Your soul will tell you what's important &gt;&gt; by your actions. I know this isn't a shouting sermon, but it's one for your soul. &gt;&gt; A long time ago, I made a decision to serve the Lord. I could have been a lot of things in life. I was offered politics. I sat in a room with huge board, powerful people. No, I was offered a lot of jobs that it would have took me away from my family. And I said, "No, no." Ministers stand in the pull pit. A whole lot of times people criticize them, but they don't know what they've had to go through to stand here. &gt;&gt; They don't know the pressures that we've had to go through in our lives to be standing here. &gt;&gt; I don't need human accolades, but one of these days I'm going to hear, "Well done, Ryan." &gt;&gt; Well done, God. I know every one of us have a different story. I know all of us do. Everybody sitting here, you've got a different story. Decisions is always having to be made. No matter what your age is or whatever times are, you're going to be influenced from a lot of dimensions. But I want to remind you that on on your phone and on your computer, there's a magic button called block. &gt;&gt; If you need to clean your phone up after this service, clean that baby up. &gt;&gt; Don't go nowhere that you wouldn't want Jesus to be with you. Don't have a conversation that you wouldn't want the Lord to hear. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm just way car. Well, go ahead and get your life straightened up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Have a have a talk with God and tell him. very personal friend of mine said, "When I got saved," he said, "I took my keys out and I took my pocketbook out." And he said, "I laid it down before me in prayer." And he said, "Father, I don't want anything to get between me and you." And I watched that man in his life, decades of hard work. And he was offered incredible amount of positions and those two things never got in his way. Moms, dads, children, make some firm commitments today. of total separation from unbelief. That's where a lot of this came from. That you will not go back. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people can walk for a few weeks, few months, a couple years, but you got to be determined in your life, I'm done. I'm done with sin. I'm done with that lifestyle. I'm done with those kind of friendships. &gt;&gt; I'm done with those habits. I want to separate. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you one more story? &gt;&gt; I didn't realize how supernatural this was. &gt;&gt; I carry in my Bible a a prayer cloth and I've carried it quite a long time. How I know it's that prayer cloth because I've signed it a certain way. And every sermon that I preached, I had that prayer cloth in my Bible. And so I'll just tell you, Brother Murphy Wong, I may have told some of you recently, but brother Murphy Wong's wife, we were at a cafeteria. Brother Murphy Wong's wife said, "Get Brother Ron's napkin. I wanted that napkin to pray with." I felt about that tall. And he said, "Somewhere in the exchange of things, somebody came and got your plate and I missed that napkin." Said, "That was last evening." And he said, "Brother, I want to ask you." He said, "So I don't lose it. I want to ask you here at dinner today, will you give me my my napkin? I was blown away. And just like that, I heard a voice in my ear. Go get that prayer cloth in your Bible, which I count certain things very sacred. Go get that prayer cloth in your Bible and cut it in half. you guys were there. Well, I ran. I ran. I don't run much now, but I ran to my cabin and I came back with that prayer cloth and laid it out on the table. Sister Connie, you put your hand on one corner. Brother Murphy put his hand on that corner and sister Mur sister Tracy put her hand on this corner and I put my hand on this corner and we begin to cut because you it's hard to cut a moving object and so we were we were cutting it and cut it. when I cut it and I handed it to her and the presence of God just went and for about 30 minutes we worshiped in the presence of the Lord and we had prayer and God just bathed. We were in a cafeteria. I don't know how many was in there, but it's quite a number that was in there. And it just it blessed me so much. Sister Katie said, "Brother Ron, it was just so worth it to see you get that kind of blessing. So now I'm going to tell you when I got back to the room, you said last night you went home after and you started looking up those quotes that he was talking about." When I got back to the room, the first quote that popped up was the Chinese laundry man &gt;&gt; said he couldn't speak English, so he tore it apart and the two pieces would fit back together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that was more than just some natural event. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought I was moving in some natural realm, but God had placed that in my heart. And here's the leading mission man that has printed has &gt;&gt; that took the English message and put it in Chinese. Not just the message 1100 and some dates, but he's taken the Bible and put that in Chinese &gt;&gt; King James version. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And here he is with his hand on that same handkerchief. And God just came and honored that whole thing. You talk about honoring our lives one of these days. That's a natural thing that happened. But one of these days, our life is going to match the word so much until he says, "Come home." &gt;&gt; Come home. I'm going to say this to you and finish. It's worth it after all. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. Maybe you'd like to say, "Brother Ron, would you remember me? Some things that I just felt in my life. You remember me?" I'm honest with you. I love these kind of services where the Lord just goes, just knows how to change our lives and just knows how to talk to us a little while. Your hands lifted before the Lord. Maybe if you'd just like to reach over and put put your hand on your neighbor's shoulder, it doesn't make you feel uncomfortable. Father, [Music] Father, breathe on us the Holy Spirit. [Music] Sometimes we're just in a journey. Don't know where we're going. Circumstances of life has tossed us. But we need you more than ever before in our lives.

You know all about me. Like David said, you know my downings, my uprisings. You know whether I would be in hell or whether I'd be in heaven. You know everything. You know the depths of my life. You know everything, Father. And yet in spite of us, you love us. Father, come fill our lives. Come touch our lives today. Our hands has went up. We need you, Father. We need you.
