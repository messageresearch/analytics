[4:04] and God's people
[4:05] the same everywhere you go it's his
[4:08] family and it's what a day is going to
[4:10] be when we get to spend time around the
[4:12] table talking about all the things we've
[4:13] been through and the situations and how
[4:16] God pulled us through so many more times
[4:18] and we're thankful for that amen let's
[4:21] just look here at Joel chapter 2 and
[4:23] verse 23 says be glad then you children
[4:27] of Zion and rejoice and the Lord your
[4:30] God for he hath given you the former
[4:32] rain moderately and he will cause us to
[4:34] come down for you the rain the former
[4:37] rain and the latter rain in the first
[4:38] month and the floor shall be full of
[4:41] wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[4:44] wine and all and I will restore to you
[4:47] the years that the locust has eaten the
[4:51] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[4:53] pommel worm my great army which has sent
[4:56] among you and you shall eat him plenty
[4:58] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[5:01] the Lord your God that is dealt
[5:03] wonderfully with you and my people shall
[5:05] never be ashamed and you shall know that
[5:09] I am the midst of Israel and I am the
[5:11] Lord your God and none else and my
[5:13] people shall never be ashamed and it
[5:17] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[5:19] pour out my spirit upon all flesh and
[5:21] your sons and your daughters shall
[5:23] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[5:26] your young men shall see visions and
[5:29] also upon the servants and upon the
[5:32] hands maids and those days while I pour
[5:34] out my spirit and I'll show wonders in
[5:36] the heavens and the earth blood and fire
[5:39] and pillars of smoke and the Sun shall
[5:41] be turned into darkness a moon into
[5:43] blood before the great and terrible day
[5:46] of the Lord had come and it shall come
[5:49] to pass that whosoever shall call him
[5:52] the name of the Lord shall be delivered
[5:55] for in the Mount Zion and the Jerusalem
[5:58] shall be deliverance as the Lord has
[6:00] said and the remnant whom the Lord shall
[6:03] call also let's look at revelations
[6:06] chapter 6 and verse 3 said when he had
[6:12] opened the second seal I heard the
[6:14] second beast say come and see and there
[6:17] went out another horse that was red
[6:19] and power was given unto him that set
[6:22] their end to take peace from the earth
[6:23] and they that shall kill one another and
[6:26] there was given unto him a great sword
[6:28] and when he had opened the third seal I
[6:31] heard the third beast say come and see
[6:33] and behold and lo a black horse and he
[6:36] that sat on him had a pair of balances
[6:37] in his hand and I heard the voice in the
[6:41] midst of the four beasts say a measure
[6:42] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[6:45] of barley for a penny and see thou not
[6:48] hurt the old and the wine amen we'll let
[6:51] you be seated this evening amen ain't
[7:03] God good amen he gives us so many
[7:07] blessings so many things we don't even
[7:09] deserve and he's there force every step
[7:12] of the way you know this this sermon
[7:16] came to me just a few moments before
[7:20] service a couple of Wednesday nights ago
[7:22] and and I kind of pushed it away you
[7:25] know you something you you study out
[7:28] something from for a week and sometimes
[7:30] weeks in advance and get ready on the
[7:32] Wednesday night to preach in just a few
[7:34] moments before the service starts here
[7:37] it comes and you just start started
[7:39] putting some things together and I
[7:40] thought no I can't do this so I push
[7:42] delete deleted it all and that was about
[7:45] 6:30 in about 7:10 after the song
[7:47] service started coming here it came
[7:49] again so I've learned one thing you
[7:51] better listen when he talks because you
[7:54] can get in a lot of trouble if you don't
[7:56] him and and and just come to me on the
[7:59] sound of freedom the sound of freedom I
[8:02] believe there is freedom in this hour
[8:03] that we live in I believe there's
[8:06] freedom to the men and women of God who
[8:08] God has come down in such a mighty way
[8:10] in the time if we're living in amen and
[8:13] the darkness is all around the
[8:15] situations and the binding with spirits
[8:17] that are binding people today but there
[8:20] is true freedom amen to the people of
[8:22] God and you know you know we there's
[8:27] something about the presence of God when
[8:29] he comes around you know brother Branham
[8:30] which makes statements
[8:32] he said wherever Jesus comes there's
[8:34] noise it isn't that you make noise to
[8:37] get Jesus to come but when Jesus comes
[8:39] there's noise there's something that
[8:41] takes place or something that moves you
[8:44] at you if you're something first any
[8:45] kind of life on the inside of you when
[8:48] you see life there there's a deep that
[8:50] called 'litham to the deep there has to
[8:51] be a deep to respond him and you know
[8:54] brother Brendan would use this he said
[8:55] one time I was out there preaching he
[8:57] said there was a boy from a certain
[8:59] church that I used to belong to come up
[9:01] and he said Billy you know what he said
[9:03] I was enjoying your message so much
[9:05] until that woman got back there and
[9:07] began screaming and crying and she got
[9:10] them all then people started crying and
[9:11] I said all that that excited you he said
[9:14] why I couldn't hear what you were saying
[9:15] and he said no and I said oh she was
[9:18] just rejoiced and he said ah that just
[9:20] made chills run up and down my back and
[9:22] he said brother branham said brother if
[9:24] you ever get to heaven you'll freeze to
[9:26] death
[9:27] he said because even the angels in
[9:29] heaven is screaming with wings over
[9:32] their face over their feet day and night
[9:34] holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy
[9:38] holy unto the Lord
[9:39] I said you're living in the quietest
[9:42] world you'll ever live in you're living
[9:45] in the quietest world you ever lived in
[9:47] he said if you go to hell there'll be
[9:49] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[9:51] teeth if you go to heaven there'll be
[9:53] glories and hallelujahs and holy unto
[9:56] the Lord day and night this is the
[9:58] quietest place you've ever will live and
[10:02] he said he happened to play on the
[10:03] Colgate's baseball team you know they
[10:05] ain't he said well you know he said well
[10:07] that they don't do that in my church and
[10:09] I said but I said but I'm brother
[10:11] minister but I hope you don't think your
[10:12] church is the pattern he said well he
[10:16] said well they don't look like very much
[10:18] like a Christian to me when a minister
[10:20] speaking to say a thing like that and I
[10:22] said you know what he said brother
[10:24] Branham said that encourages me he said
[10:26] even when they see a man it means
[10:28] so--but he said I used to have an old
[10:30] dog you know you hear he would take
[10:32] anything but a skunk and I'd get him a
[10:34] tree under the brush pile and anything

[11:01] said I didn't live very far from the
[11:03] part not over five blocks and so I've
[11:05] never heard so much noise in all my life

[13:24] anything that's quiet he said anything
[13:26] that quiet is dead he said I ain't much
[13:30] for dead things he said anything without
[13:32] emotion is dead what anything without
[13:35] emotion is dead sold for your experience
[13:38] hasn't got a little noise to it or a
[13:40] little emotion to it you better bury it
[13:43] and get something else that's got some
[13:45] life in it
[13:49] hallelujah Amen that's one thing I don't
[13:52] want anybody to blame me for being his
[13:55] dead hallelujah you say well I don't
[14:01] know you know is there's a lot of work
[14:03] up you know brother Brandon would say
[14:05] this and I think this was pretty
[14:06] profound because he used something so
[14:08] simple about about explaining how
[14:11] somebody can realize the presence of God
[14:14] is near and the next person don't even
[14:16] know it's anything's happening he said
[14:19] as possible you can be sitting here he
[14:21] said everyone of us has got the same
[14:23] sense that see taste smell feeling here
[14:25] he said you can have such a headache
[14:27] that you couldn't sit still and I
[14:30] wouldn't have one how do I know you have
[14:32] a headache
[14:34] it's something individual with you and
[14:37] he said how the Spirit of God can come
[14:40] down into a group of people and can
[14:43] baptize a person in such a way that the
[14:45] power of God cares them till they don't
[14:47] even know where they're at anymore and
[14:49] the next person sit right next to them
[14:52] and know nothing about it listen I don't
[14:56] ever want to get in that condition when
[14:58] the Spirit of God can fall down the
[15:01] pewte next to me and I'd not know
[15:03] anything about it
[15:04] I want to know something is going on
[15:07] that God is in the midst of his people I
[15:10] don't want to ever be in the service
[15:13] when the power of God it's sweeping
[15:15] through the building and I don't realize
[15:16] it I don't know it I don't feel it I
[15:19] don't understand it I want to know every
[15:21] time he comes hallelujah God make us
[15:27] cognate of his presence he comes every
[15:30] service but sometimes he's biased before
[15:33] he realized these came in his wind there
[15:37] was so many that watched him as he
[15:39] walked down the streets of Jerusalem or
[15:41] the streets of Samaria and they missed
[15:43] him when he come by and they didn't
[15:45] recognize him when he came by I don't
[15:48] want to be in that group I want to be
[15:50] the one who recognized this is my moment
[15:52] this is my time this is my service this
[15:57] is my time with the king of King this is
[16:00] my moment with him I I have a I have an
[16:03] opportunity to be with him
[16:08] how many others who was there when the
[16:10] woman touched the hem of His garment but
[16:12] they didn't recognize him they thought I
[16:15] was just some old fogies just some old
[16:17] preacher somewhere somebody he's made
[16:19] him out stephane job we know who he
[16:21] really is
[16:22] he's just the son of Joseph and Mary
[16:24] trying to make himself to me but this
[16:26] woman said this is my moment hallelujah
[16:31] listen this weekend then this service
[16:33] even tonight and he's coming up you
[16:35] ought to take care of her services this
[16:37] is my moment this is my time to have a
[16:43] hug a moment with the conference with
[16:46] God this is my time to hear directly
[16:49] from him the doctor was talking about
[16:57] the Brenham he says you know he said
[16:59] don't you think them people just get a
[17:01] little excited he just to be excited no
[17:04] sir said well that's just nervousness
[17:06] there's something that causes them to
[17:07] scream and holler and go home as a
[17:09] doctor you mean to tell me that nerves
[17:11] can be excited without something to
[17:13] excite them something has to excite them
[17:18] what is it he said so what's there he
[17:21] said I said it's the unseen force of the
[17:24] Holy Ghost moving among us it excites
[17:28] that born-again spirit it brings an
[17:31] excitement to that spirit the power of
[17:33] God moving down and faith began to stir
[17:36] the only ghost takes the word and begins
[17:38] to take it to the people to catch it
[17:40] with a power that regenerated borning in
[17:43] life something has to cry out something
[17:48] has to cry out but as we read y'all seen
[17:53] the day coming he's and are in her
[17:56] opening scripture here let's look back
[17:59] at he says be glad then he children of
[18:02] Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for
[18:05] his giving you the former reigning he
[18:07] calls that the former in the latter rain
[18:09] but the floors shall be full of wheat
[18:13] that gives me confidence right there hey
[18:17] man the devil may do all he wants to do
[18:19] and he may try to make this will stop
[18:21] and this one quit that one deny the
[18:24] message and this will walk away but at
[18:25] the scripture the prophecy of Joel said
[18:28] the floor will be full of wheat hey man
[18:33] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[18:36] oh he meant wine the stimulation of
[18:42] Revelation
[18:44] amen amen
[18:46] I love how he goes on down he said it
[18:49] shall come to pass that I will pour out
[18:52] my spirit upon all flesh now we know
[18:56] what happened on the day of Pentecost in
[18:58] the but upper room they were gathering
[19:00] the upper room they got in one mind and
[19:02] one Accord they began to sit aside
[19:06] themselves and begin to realize their
[19:08] thoughts of what they thought it was
[19:10] going to be and how they thought it was
[19:12] going to happen and how they would have
[19:13] done it or where they would have had the
[19:15] meeting or where they would have had the
[19:16] building what will mate with all what
[19:18] they would have done they put it on the
[19:20] side and they said we want to hear from
[19:22] Jesus he promised us going tarry in
[19:25] Jerusalem and I'll send you power from
[19:27] on high
[19:28] we
[19:29] put aside what we want what we think
[19:31] what we decide how we would do it how we
[19:34] would operate what we want food we would
[19:37] serve what we would do we're gonna put
[19:39] it all aside and we gonna get in one
[19:42] mind and one accord and then is not mine
[19:45] or not our walks it is the mind of
[19:48] Christ hallelujah and the Spirit of God
[19:53] came through as a rushing mighty wind I
[19:57] want you to understand it wasn't just
[19:59] something to made your hair fluffle a

[20:11] their burdens and this rushing mighty

[21:11] drunk is something wrong here what's
[21:12] going on in any member and Peter says no
[21:15] we're not drunk that's all in a third
[21:17] hour of the day they ain't drinking time
[21:23] amen we're not drunk as you suppose or
[21:26] on some natural drink or some Budweiser
[21:28] or wine somewhere we're not drunk on
[21:31] that we're drunk on a new wine
[21:35] hallelujah I believe God still got a
[21:37] people who knows how to drink a man
[21:42] knows how to drink knows how to drink in
[21:45] the spirit knows how to drink in the
[21:47] move of God so God can come and wash it
[21:51] all away amen if you don't care let's
[21:59] get drunk that's going a good drunk this
[22:01] weekend amen
[22:07] but it's possible the some can sit there
[22:11] and the power of God moving and then
[22:15] some others not even know nothing about
[22:16] it we got that going on in this day you
[22:21] know people coming along with this new
[22:23] way of worship you know and how you're
[22:26] supposed to know their ideas of how
[22:28] worship out of being you know and they
[22:30] don't like you to get too excited don't
[22:32] like you to get too emotional yeah you
[22:39] know I was I would say yeah
[22:41] I was thinking about that one day as I
[22:43] was driving actually when we came
[22:45] through here we came through here for
[22:47] the my father-in-law's funeral there and
[22:50] we came to spoke that Sunday night spoke
[22:52] on the the power of praise I was driving
[22:56] home and I was thinking about that and I
[22:58] got to thinking again about David and
[23:00] how because you know we've we've been
[23:02] criticized for our music and criticized
[23:04] for things you know you do anything
[23:06] right you're going to get criticized but
[23:09] and so I just kind of was burdened me
[23:11] because me as a song leader you don't
[23:13] want to do wrong but I mean you want to
[23:15] be have freedom you want to be able to
[23:16] worship God I I don't need no rules and
[23:19] regulations on how to worship God but I
[23:23] was thinking about David and it just
[23:25] struck me again you know about how a
[23:27] brother branham talking about how you
[23:29] dance at the return of the art that
[23:31] probably wasn't a very quiet little
[23:33] service I don't think I don't think that
[23:37] was very quiet no but there was somebody
[23:39] that began to look on him and despise
[23:41] him you know I know I met anyone looked
[23:43] at that I realize you know it wasn't the
[23:45] Philistines marking him it wasn't
[23:47] malachite smoking him it was his own
[23:49] people but what did God do God shut up
[23:55] the womb where they wouldn't bring up
[23:56] brief she couldn't bring forth fruit nor
[24:00] Adam said and David said you don't like
[24:02] that watch this and the power of God
[24:07] coming my Bruma in that cars I'm driving
[24:10] down the road and he spoke to me he said
[24:12] if they didn't like this year what they
[24:14] didn't like last year watch this here
[24:17] [Applause]
[24:20] hallelujah if they didn't like last
[24:23] service watch this service hallelujah
[24:28] I'm expecting more of God more healings
[24:31] more deliverances more miracles more
[24:35] visions I'm expecting more of the
[24:39] supernatural the God he says god help
[24:46] today when we come and adopt a theology
[24:49] instead of the baptism of the Holy
[24:51] Spirit God helped the day when we take
[24:56] in tithing from the church and bold up
[24:58] some old tough rooster and solder for 50
[25:01] cents on the plate
[25:02] to get enough money to pay the preacher
[25:04] god help the day when we substituted the
[25:07] upper room for a supper ooh god help the
[25:10] day when we've taken an old-fashioned
[25:13] st. Paul revival in the Bible Holy Ghost
[25:16] preached and his power and simplicity
[25:18] and traded it for a bunch of theology
[25:24] long ago he said I was thinking I was
[25:26] who I was up in Canada was riding to a
[25:28] night I've been back about 40 or 50
[25:30] miles thousands of miles from the
[25:32] hardtop road back there hunting and I
[25:35] was riding through the moonlight and I
[25:37] came to a big old barn over it was a
[25:39] great bunch of big old tall stately
[25:41] pines and the moon was shining on them
[25:43] looked like a graveyard a spooky looking
[25:45] place and he said there came a wind down
[25:48] through there and the wind beginning to
[25:50] hit them and they go
[25:53] I've been there I was actually up on
[25:55] them not not in this location here but I
[25:57] was on Mount Lemmon with brother Doug
[25:58] Baker and that had a fire up there and
[26:01] he took me on top it's a couple of years
[26:03] after the fire and there was he snags
[26:04] you don't stick it out we sat on the
[26:07] side and overlooked in the Tucson Valley
[26:08] down there and the wind began to blow
[26:11] man them trees begin to make noises and
[26:14] it wasn't
[26:15] I couldn't man I was there in the
[26:16] daylight I could imagine being the
[26:18] moonlight I always said I'm not afraid
[26:21] of the dark I'm afraid of the things in
[26:22] the dark yeah hey man yeah just the most
[26:35] mournful sound you ever heard in your
[26:37] life and he said I looked at that a bit
[26:39] in those trees he said but those trees
[26:41] put me in mind of some of the great big
[26:44] fines fired churches standing but just
[26:47] as dead as a doornail he said the Palmer
[26:51] worms eat all the bark off of them hey
[26:56] man you know what the bark is is the
[26:58] covering of the tree
[26:59] I believe his brother Donnie he said it
[27:01] like this he said you sisters need to
[27:03] watch out the palm worms get in your
[27:04] bark some things are just worth
[27:10] repeating ain't a man that goes for the
[27:13] men nowadays lord have mercy man how did
[27:21] I get there anyway fired that trials
[27:23] have blazed all the spirit away from
[27:25] there's nothing left but a great big
[27:27] statue but just as dead as can be and he
[27:30] said when the rushing mighty wind comes
[27:32] from heaven the only thing they can do
[27:35] is groan and carry on and hardly know
[27:37] anything is going on if say days of
[27:40] miracles are pass it'll say only God
[27:44] send visions our brother branham
[27:50] they'll say only God did things like
[27:53] that 50 years ago we don't have services
[27:59] like that no more what the pom worm left
[28:05] the caterpillar eating he said what the
[28:06] Methodists left the Baptist seen what
[28:08] the babbles left the Presbyterian is
[28:10] they listen listen it's nothing but the
[28:12] truth we we brother brother Ron's been
[28:14] there we had our family camp over in
[28:17] Scottsville Texas he was there the first
[28:19] one wasn't you were that every one of
[28:20] them I don't know if y'all know this we
[28:24] love that guy so if y'all get rid of we
[28:27] got a place for him all right but anyway
[28:34] actually I believe it was Buddy Robinson
[28:36] that preached at this camp but we had
[28:39] our first camp and it was a some of the
[28:42] camper people that work there they were
[28:44] Nazarene came to the front of the some
[28:47] of the services and then one man just
[28:48] said they were tears running down his
[28:50] face they come and told her one of our
[28:52] deacons later he says we used to have
[28:56] services just like you have we used to
[29:01] have worship like you got it he said
[29:04] well we've lost it and let me tell you
[29:09] that Palmer worm and Caterpillar and all
[29:10] that for stages is still at work and
[29:14] it's eating in the message ranks
[29:19] critical spirits are rising up and and
[29:22] trying to squash the real moving of the
[29:25] Holy Ghost
[29:26] you know I got to thinking of how
[29:28] brother Branham you know does it get you
[29:32] prepared brother Branham says that he
[29:35] said tell us a story several times and I
[29:37] love it just look one of my favorite
[29:39] stories he tells one place he said he
[29:41] was doing a teaching on the second
[29:43] coming of the Lord he said I was
[29:44] teaching about four hours four hours
[29:49] that goes throughout some of you 30
[29:51] minute 45 minute you know see OD people
[29:56] for hours he said we have the thought
[30:01] I'd give the people a break so I did a
[30:03] little halftime and they say you know
[30:05] somebody started playing the piano and
[30:06] another one started beating on a
[30:08] washboard and one place he says I
[30:10] thought they was gonna turn my church
[30:11] into a tavern and he's there dancing in
[30:13] things and he's just not me but what one
[30:15] place he says and it just struck me so
[30:17] deeply he said I was back there and you
[30:20] know I was looking and I was watching
[30:22] all that take place he said but I
[30:23] wouldn't say anything he said because I
[30:26] was afraid they might be right and I
[30:29] might be wrong if a prophet can have
[30:36] that kind of attitude why can't we have
[30:40] the same attitude we're so we're so
[30:43] quick to just a lot of opinions and
[30:45] won't wait they listen it's just our
[30:47] opinion hey man but he said that woman
[30:54] he said I believe it she'd have had four
[30:56] rows of keys should have played every
[30:59] one of them that's the kind of piano
[31:02] playing I like and he said that well the
[31:06] one we got there to play in that thimble
[31:08] and I watched bored and the other one
[31:09] got to dancing and he said I was looking
[31:10] there and he's like I was wondering
[31:12] about it you know about this and he said
[31:14] I was in the seat of the scornful and he
[31:16] was kind of looking at his scorning in
[31:17] it and thinking they're turning his
[31:19] church in the tavern and he but he said
[31:21] I begin to think maybe you know what
[31:22] fundamentalist don't know everything
[31:26] Wow
[31:27] and he said you know I I got to looking
[31:30] at that I got to pondering it what where
[31:32] is dancing in the Bible and he said I
[31:34] got to remember Miriam Miriam on one
[31:39] side was running for her life on the
[31:41] other side of the river on the other
[31:43] side of the Dead Sea she was dancing and
[31:46] rejoicing and praising God because all
[31:48] of her test master was dead he reckoned
[31:54] that was a sound of freedom you reckon
[31:57] that was a quite service
[32:00] no something coming on the inside he
[32:03] can't hit me no more he came by me no
[32:07] more he can't make me make one more
[32:09] throw one more break he can't make me
[32:12] serve not one more day hallo they began
[32:18] to sing a new song hallelujah the
[32:25] brother who said about that time my miss
[32:27] and his foot got to tap it a little bit
[32:29] he said then I got some thinking about
[32:31] David when he saw the word being
[32:33] restored is that not what we have
[32:37] witnessed in this day the word has been
[32:40] brought back in his full power fall Holy
[32:44] Ghost fall healings food deliverances
[32:47] fall freedom you don't have to stay in
[32:53] your cell deny the doors are open all
[32:57] you got to do is walk out of there and
[33:00] say I'm delivered I'm free next thing
[33:12] you know he said he was up there dancing
[33:13] with her he said I ain't never done that
[33:17] before he said but I think it did a
[33:18] pretty good job hey man I don't know you
[33:25] but he says you know what one left the
[33:28] other eat til there's got nothing but
[33:30] big a big dead tree we see him nowadays
[33:34] I was building we're building a new
[33:37] building there at the church and we went
[33:38] to look this guy that was actually
[33:39] putting the building up he told us about
[33:41] another one had another Church he had
[33:42] put up so we went to look at his work
[33:45] and kind of get some ideas and so this
[33:48] lady was over the the buildings and
[33:50] things opened the door for us and she
[33:53] said where y'all from we told her we'd
[33:54] was just down the road there at the new
[33:56] church and she so I watch to come up and
[33:58] wow this is wonderful how many how many
[34:01] people comes on a Sunday and say well I
[34:03] don't know about 200 250 probably maybe
[34:06] a little more some give or take you see
[34:09] I've got any young people
[34:10] I said yeah we got about 40 or 50
[34:14] young people and that's certain ages and
[34:16] then in our Sunday School there's about
[34:18] another 50 or 60 feet young kids she
[34:21] just looked at me just stared at me
[34:23] she said what kind of program do y'all
[34:26] have I said it's the oldest program in
[34:32] the Bible it's called repent and be
[34:38] baptized and you shall receive the gift
[34:40] of the Holy Ghost
[34:42] it's a Word of God that's keeping them
[34:44] young people not some not some program
[34:47] or some dinner or this or that there we
[34:50] preach the Word of God but the Palmer
[34:56] worms and all these they're in it these
[34:58] insects have stripped the power away but
[35:02] there is a promise I will restore hello
[35:10] he said I happened he said I happen to
[35:13] look that night that wind was blowing
[35:15] through how stiff and starchy and dead
[35:17] they were sitting there moaning and
[35:18] groaning then have no life to bend with
[35:20] it no bark on it and make it flexible
[35:22] just sitting there moaning and groaning
[35:24] only count of the wind I thought my but
[35:27] I happened to notice
[35:28] down underneath there was some
[35:30] undergrowth coming up some little bushes
[35:34] about like that they had life in them
[35:36] and when that wind began to hit them
[35:38] they begin twisting and ringing and
[35:40] shouting and having a glorious time he
[35:43] said let me tell you brother God's going
[35:45] to raise up a generation of people out
[35:48] of all this dead stuff that's going to
[35:53] restore saith the Lord God is going to
[35:55] raise up people who believe in signs and
[35:58] wonders God's going to raise up people
[36:01] who's got joy unspeakable and full of
[36:04] glory God's gonna raise up people that I
[36:08] believe that he's the same yesterday
[36:09] today and forever
[36:12] and when that rushing mighty wind comes
[36:15] it just gives right into it and frolics
[36:19] and dances and glorifies God Greenleaf's
[36:22] clapping their hands and having a
[36:23] wonderful time
[36:24] what a frolic
[36:26] little under ruthless habit but that big
[36:28] old tree standing that moanin and
[36:30] groanin same wind same wind the same one
[36:42] with the same way was making one moan
[36:45] and groan was the same with that the
[36:47] other was given the other a good time
[36:51] maybe you've been a Mona and groaner
[36:54] maybe been murmuring and complaining but
[36:57] there is a promise I will restore you
[37:03] don't have to stay there
[37:06] amen the same win hallelujah
[37:14] then we going down he said think you
[37:16] know I'm crazy but I'm happy this way
[37:20] Amen same here tonight let me tell you
[37:23] brother yes indeed if there ever was a
[37:25] time we need to get going this today
[37:27] said I think about the time when Moses
[37:30] back there was talking I was talking to
[37:32] him the other night when God said wait
[37:33] you say well wait till I get ready
[37:36] he said when God called Moses he didn't
[37:39] have nothing but his hand a stick what's
[37:43] in your hand God sinned he said a stick
[37:46] he said take that how am I gonna whip
[37:49] this army what do you got in your hand a
[37:52] stick take that and go down whatever
[37:56] snare you pick it up and go home and
[37:58] away when Moses went there one man
[38:00] invasion to go take over Egypt with a
[38:02] stick in his hand God told him take what
[38:06] he had listened it was the greatest
[38:09] sound of freedom in 400 years as began
[38:11] to sound out let my people go let my
[38:17] people go and Moses
[38:19] you looked emotion you thought emotion
[38:20] what you done lost your mind he said act
[38:22] you're exactly right I tried with my
[38:25] whole mind to try to to try to set them
[38:28] free and all I can do is produce more
[38:30] than that Egyptian but I met a pillar of
[38:33] fire on the backside of it
[38:34] desert it was a rushing mighty win and
[38:37] listen if you could see in the other
[38:38] realms about Moses was that same pillar
[38:41] of fire it was well and over Moses as he
[38:45] walked towards Egypt it was a sound of
[38:48] freedom let my people go may that sound
[38:55] go forth tonight you don't have to stay
[38:58] bound you don't have to say depressed
[39:00] you don't have to stay bound with
[39:02] depression or fear there is a power that
[39:06] says let my people go there is a sound
[39:12] of freedom Alleluia
[39:18] there is a word here that has been
[39:20] brought that's not for your defeat or
[39:22] Europe did your demise this word is for
[39:26] your victory hallelujah he meant
[39:38] sometimes the sound comes in many
[39:39] different avenues and many different
[39:41] ways it was Samson one time sitting up
[39:46] there minding his own business and here
[39:48] devil come with a thousand of his amps
[39:51] come to surround him but there was a
[39:53] sound of freedom there laying in the
[39:55] looking like a jawbone let me tell you
[40:01] that devil is about he's an idiot I
[40:08] don't know about you but just for me I'm
[40:11] just you know I may not be the smartest
[40:13] cookie but if I seen a guy pick up a job
[40:17] on and about the fifth person he hit and
[40:21] they fell over dead I'm out
[40:26] go I'm out
[40:32] because I realized something's behind
[40:34] that that's greater than their jawbone
[40:37] that's greater than that man swinging
[40:40] that Joe ball but the devil is a dumb
[40:43] devil he'll stay around till he's
[40:44] utterly defeated hallelujah
[40:49] just like you did when they was chasing
[40:51] after the children of Israel after God
[40:54] had decimated Hillman and showed him who
[40:57] was God he was dumb enough to get on his
[40:59] horse and ride down to the Red Sea and
[41:03] God said I've been waiting for this
[41:05] moment
[41:06] I created the mountains I created that
[41:09] see I placed this before the foundation
[41:12] of the world I had it in my mind not for
[41:14] my children's demise or defeat before
[41:17] the devil's defeat I want you to
[41:21] understand the agent we're living in
[41:23] it's not for your demise it's not for
[41:26] your defeat this atmosphere has been
[41:29] created then all hell will be loose in
[41:33] oh hell we'll be defeated he's brought
[41:43] him down and say come home bring your
[41:46] horses come out of the Year river
[41:47] euphrates thousand times thousands been
[41:50] released all kinds of things sickness of
[41:53] every kind tormenting spirits of every
[41:55] kind have been brought here for they're
[41:57] burning another one I'm just show you
[42:04] how dumb the devil is Shamgar

[52:44] shame we don't have to be ashamed of our
[52:48] music we don't have to be ashamed of our
[52:50] saying we don't have to be ashamed of my
[52:53] worship he's worthy of worship he's one
[52:57] of their praise he's one of their glory
[53:02] hallelujah when Jesus comes there's
[53:11] always noise there's something on
[53:13] something the inside of a believer says
[53:15] this my lord
[53:16] that's my god that's my king that's my
[53:20] everything that's my own and all you
[53:29] know they said it was a prophet one time
[53:31] getting such a stew because you know I
[53:33] believe it was Ahab when one of the
[53:35] wicked King came up and he said he said
[53:38] if Jehoshaphat wasn't here I wouldn't
[53:39] even speak to you got our anger about it
[53:43] you said what in the world was the
[53:47] Prophet getting angry for how can that
[53:49] happen but he's he couldn't hear from
[53:53] nothing from God so he said bring me a
[53:55] minstrel
[53:57] so he brought him a minstrel he said
[54:01] well brother Branham I'm not the Prophet
[54:03] he's over you ain't the Prophet you can
[54:06] be an instrument
[54:11] he said if all you can do is give vent
[54:14] to them ten strains give vent to them
[54:17] just as hard as you can
[54:20] instead if you can't be the Prophet be
[54:22] part of the minstrels but do something
[54:25] to bring the spirit of the Lord down I
[54:28] want to be guilty of bringing the Spirit
[54:31] of the Lord down the Prophet can't do it
[54:34] all himself he had to have a minstrel to
[54:36] help him then when you see every said
[54:38] when the Prophet and the people got in
[54:39] harmony with God then the Prophet began
[54:42] to see things he said brother if you
[54:44] don't see divine healing if you don't
[54:45] see the baptism the Holy Ghost if you
[54:47] don't see that mighty move of the Spirit
[54:49] of God moving the last stage here just
[54:51] getting the spirit one time and you'll
[54:53] see things will be revealed to you then
[54:56] you'll begin to notice things are looked
[54:58] a little different and you won't go
[55:01] along with that criticizing spirit oh
[55:05] man now this let's cut the tape for a
[55:11] moment this is all free but I know how
[55:13] it is in a meeting a meeting comes the
[55:15] devil tries to bring every kind of
[55:17] critical thing in hey I know I've been
[55:25] there I fought I had to fight it had to
[55:28] deal with it had to let's lay it all
[55:30] aside lay it all aside it ain't just our
[55:36] opinions how something should be done or
[55:40] shouldn't be it's just our opinions but
[55:42] brother Daniel Williams he's going on to
[55:45] be the Lord he had a wonderful statement
[55:46] he said everybody has opinion just like
[55:49] they got noses it just
[55:52] we all got him I got him I go to the
[55:59] church yeah I see things I wouldn't do
[56:01] if it was my church but I don't mean I
[56:03] have to say it
[56:08] alright now we roll the tape again yeah
[56:15] well I do okay yeah but you know he says
[56:23] that a prophet seen a vision after the
[56:26] Spirit of God began to move and freedom
[56:28] of getting to move back in the camp

[56:33] gonna see rain here win but there's
[56:36] going to be water to come but you've got

[56:48] all got a part to play if you want
[56:50] something from God dig the ditch you say

[57:11] ditch that goes for every one of us what
[57:16] is it huh Isaac teaching you to have the
[57:18] Hermit to him to become humility and to
[57:20] get yourself down into the dirt where
[57:23] you came from it start digging out the
[57:26] trenches you want to bless them from God
[57:28] this weekend have your ditches ready

[57:44] monitors and we have Netflix and we do
[57:48] well let me just tell you something this
[57:50] is for free was dealing with a situation
[57:54] at home with a young lady she fell out
[57:59] under a demonic power and she heard her
[58:04] daddy got involved there right off the
[58:06] bat and began to challenge the devil you
[58:09] know the devil did begin to speak in a
[58:12] voice it was not hers
[58:14] it says you're nothing but a fake all
[58:17] you're gonna do is go back to your TV
[58:23] give the man credit he jumped me jump
[58:26] back threw his hands up in front of
[58:27] everybody's a hundred people there said
[58:30] it's the truth I've allowed Hulu TV or

[58:36] know we it's kind of like they say you
[58:40] know we wouldn't go to the movies but
[58:41] the devil pulled the wool over our eyes
[58:42] and it just keeps getting the wool keeps
[58:45] getting changed well I don't have no
[58:48] antenna I don't have satellite but we
[58:49] got Internet we bring all this mess into
[58:53] our homes and we wonder why we're not
[58:55] getting the blessing of God dig the
[58:58] ditch whatever it is if it's a critical
[59:02] spirit dig it out if it's bitterness
[59:05] just think the time to hold bitterness
[59:07] if you want something from God you can't
[59:10] come with a bitterness in your heart
[59:11] towards a brother or anybody it don't
[59:14] matter if it's your wife husband pastor
[59:16] this and the other if it's a neighbor
[59:17] down the road you can't have it in you
[59:21] you got to dig it out if you want that
[59:24] to be filled with the waters of God you
[59:26] had to get it's a struggle God so
[59:39] remember the more they dug the more
[59:41] water they got hit a snag throw that
[59:45] snag out lots of times your digging you
[59:47] hit the neighbor the lives next door
[59:48] keep digging
[59:49] sometimes you hit your pastor along the
[59:51] lines just keep digging dig dig dig he
[59:56] said we will but one thing for sure we
[59:59] don't want nothing shallow
[1:00:03] I mean notice what he did without my
[1:00:10] goodness time flying when you have him
[1:00:12] fun you notice what he did with a woman
[1:00:16] at the whale she walked in there with
[1:00:19] her water book the scripture says she
[1:00:20] had her waterpot and he comes and said
[1:00:23] tells her to give him a drink into you
[1:00:25] she says and she and then he tells her I
[1:00:27] can give you a drink that you'll not
[1:00:28] thirst again she says huh you don't have
[1:00:31] a waterpot I got a waterpot but as the
[1:00:36] scripture progresses and she begins to
[1:00:39] see this ain't just a man talking to her
[1:00:41] it's ain't just a prophet talking to her
[1:00:44] this is God talking to me the scripture
[1:00:48] says and she ran into she left her
[1:00:51] waterpot what she came think it was so
[1:00:57] important wasn't so important no more
[1:00:59] when you meet Jesus you'll find out a
[1:01:02] lot of things ain't so important anymore
[1:01:06] hey man that was for free to keep on
[1:01:09] diggin get a great big deep ditch
[1:01:13] because what was he doing the woman at
[1:01:15] the well he's taking it from the surface
[1:01:16] my water pot to the dips the more ditch
[1:01:22] you dig the more water you get the more
[1:01:25] water you get the more happiness and joy
[1:01:28] and things of God you can receive he
[1:01:30] said well whatever to get dig the
[1:01:32] ditches and get all the world out of the
[1:01:35] way get all those picture shows and hoe
[1:01:37] downs and things you're tending to and
[1:01:39] let all that go and let the waters come
[1:01:42] in give God first place get those things
[1:01:45] straightened out then first thing you
[1:01:46] know the old stale bait the enemy a look
[1:01:49] and say I believe it had a slaughter
[1:01:50] down there looks like blood and they
[1:01:53] rose and came and God set up an ambush
[1:01:55] against him hallelujah and beat them all
[1:02:00] the way to the wall and they burnt every
[1:02:02] city they stopped every well why because
[1:02:05] they started digging ditches hallelujah
[1:02:11] we want the victory but do we want to
[1:02:13] dig the ditch
[1:02:15] we want the freedom but we got to start
[1:02:18] digging it out of our lives
[1:02:24] hallelujah all as we read in the the
[1:02:31] third seal would bring this down really
[1:02:33] quick all typifies the Holy Spirit wine
[1:02:38] simile symbolizes stimulation of
[1:02:40] Revelation he said brother Branham said
[1:02:43] when I was seeing that I like to run all
[1:02:46] over the place I stopped up a lot of old
[1:02:50] stagnated Wells right there listen said
[1:02:58] they took it and that's great that
[1:02:59] scripture they took rocks brother
[1:03:02] Branham said that was a rock of
[1:03:03] testimony don't ever be ashamed of your
[1:03:06] testimony because that testimony was
[1:03:08] shut the devil's mouth up because you
[1:03:15] know we were like I said we've been
[1:03:16] criticized by our music and things and
[1:03:19] whatever but it was amazing to me that
[1:03:22] during some music one day was this
[1:03:26] little woman dried up to about 90 pounds
[1:03:30] sitting back there in the back in our
[1:03:32] mezzanine seating cancer and her all lay
[1:03:35] up in her lungs wasn't just just dying
[1:03:39] she'll be here this next weekend that'll
[1:03:44] shut the devil's mouth up and here in
[1:03:49] all this worldly music you know this
[1:03:52] woman gets under the influence of the
[1:03:54] Holy Ghost couldn't hardly even stand
[1:03:57] weak under the the doctor says that told
[1:04:00] her its total later said I thought the
[1:04:02] medicine with the treatments was gonna
[1:04:04] kill you because she was down to nothing
[1:04:07] but the power of God fell on her as we
[1:04:10] begin to sing my father standing at the
[1:04:13] pulpit out of her seat she got to begin
[1:04:15] to run around the building it's weak
[1:04:19] 90-pound woman beginning to run around
[1:04:21] the building praising God sister Atlanta
[1:04:23] but the next day she goes to the doctor
[1:04:27] and they do another scan
[1:04:28] and every sign of cancer is gone
[1:04:42] hallelujah Lord of heart he said I like
[1:04:47] to ran around the building when I heard
[1:04:49] that the Holy Ghost stimulates you
[1:04:53] it's a stimulation of Revelation you
[1:04:56] can't get one without getting the other
[1:05:00] it's all and the wine and listen why
[1:05:04] would he tell him don't hurt it holding
[1:05:12] one of the Bible's socially associated
[1:05:14] together always he said when the truth
[1:05:17] of a promised Word of God has been truly
[1:05:19] revealed to his Saints that's filled
[1:05:21] with all oh yeah they get all stimulated
[1:05:24] why in his stimulation he said glory I
[1:05:26] feel it right now stimulated with joy
[1:05:29] and shouts and hallelujah he said what
[1:05:32] it does it has the same effect on them
[1:05:34] that wine has upon a natural man he said
[1:05:41] because when the revelation has been
[1:05:42] given of the truth of God the true
[1:05:45] believer filled with all the revelation
[1:05:47] is revealed the stimulation becomes so
[1:05:49] great that it makes them behave himself
[1:05:51] on normally in other words you don't no
[1:05:58] longer make the normal list you know my
[1:06:04] brother-in-law Aaron you know brother
[1:06:06] Aaron he's preached hearing me my other
[1:06:08] brother all Jeff they had this joke
[1:06:09] about you know they had a normal list
[1:06:12] and you know there was the only two
[1:06:14] people that can make the normal list and
[1:06:18] now that Aaron's become a preacher
[1:06:19] hearing on the normal list when you get
[1:06:26] filled with this Holy Ghost
[1:06:28] you ain't no more on the normal is
[1:06:30] you're not a normal person
[1:06:34] you don't have a normal service you
[1:06:39] don't have a normal day you don't have a
[1:06:42] normal moment of your life when that
[1:06:44] Holy Ghost falls on the inside of you
[1:06:46] and it begins to stimulate you you
[1:06:49] behave yourself are normally he said
[1:06:52] that's right maybe that's what's the
[1:06:54] matter with them now that's right
[1:06:56] it makes them behave themselves on
[1:06:58] seemingly so you're not normal and you
[1:07:02] don't seem to be in your right mind
[1:07:05] you've lost yourself you've lost who you
[1:07:09] thought you was going to be all the
[1:07:11] plans that you had made all the things
[1:07:13] you had prepared but all God had
[1:07:15] something else for you hallelujah listen
[1:07:20] let me tell you this didn't only mess up
[1:07:22] your friends it messed up the devil's
[1:07:24] plans
[1:07:25] the devil had plans for you to be a
[1:07:27] prostitute or a drunk out on the streets
[1:07:30] or some drug dealer or something else
[1:07:32] somewhere or some businessman but God
[1:07:35] messed up his plans hallelujah and
[1:07:40] you're not normal no more why because of
[1:07:44] something on the inside we need to have
[1:07:52] a sign up here this next weekend says we
[1:07:54] ain't normal hit if you are you probably
[1:08:01] not won't feel comfortable

[1:09:26] this right here he says a strange thing
[1:09:29] but everywhere God is there seems to be
[1:09:31] a lot of noise he said in Isaiah was in
[1:09:34] the temple he said he heard a noise and
[1:09:37] the whole temple was shaking the posts
[1:09:40] were moving out of their place angels
[1:09:42] and serums and cherubims burners of the
[1:09:44] sacrifice given the repent of the right
[1:09:46] of the altar those are great beings
[1:09:47] beyond the Angels with their wings over
[1:09:49] the faces their feet flying shaking the
[1:09:51] tabernacle screaming holy holy holy is
[1:09:55] the Lord God Almighty he said wherever
[1:09:57] Jesus is there's always a lot of noise
[1:10:03] he entered the temple one day and they
[1:10:06] broke down palms and screamed and
[1:10:08] shouted and he said those great
[1:10:10] professors of society priests make them
[1:10:12] hold their peace he said if they hold
[1:10:14] their peace of rocks will cry out
[1:10:17] I'm gonna tell you they drop gonna take
[1:10:19] my place as long as I'm alive to glorify

[1:10:48] noise when this earth burns he said the
[1:10:52] day of the Lord will come as a thief in
[1:10:54] the night so it sounded like to me God
[1:10:56] don't really like it quite he likes a
[1:11:00] lot of noise in which the heavens shall
[1:11:07] pass away with a great noise and the
[1:11:13] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:11:16] and the earth also and the works that
[1:11:18] are in it therein shall be burned up now

[1:14:38] of freedom
[1:14:39] when this earth goes back to what she
[1:14:41] was supposed to be back to a Garden of
[1:14:45] Eden again back to perfect peace back to
[1:14:48] perfect hell back to perfect everything
[1:14:54] many of you that want to put down the
[1:14:57] word and Greek word pass away it comes
[1:14:59] he said how I said but how is this word
[1:15:01] going to pass away and we're gonna live
[1:15:03] on it
[1:15:04] he said notice he said has struck me I
[1:15:08] can't even pronounce the word but he
[1:15:11] said the Lord struck me said heavens and
[1:15:14] earth pass away says passing from one
[1:15:17] form to another it does not mean
[1:15:20] anihilation it means passing from one
[1:15:24] form to another the same is what you did
[1:15:29] you pass from one form a drunkard a dub
[1:15:33] head whatever he was sinner religious
[1:15:38] demon whatever it was and the powers of
[1:15:41] God begin the world over you and that
[1:15:42] holy fire burnt within you there was a
[1:15:45] lot of noise and you pass from one form
[1:15:49] to another I'm so glad he didn't throw
[1:15:54] the clay away he could have but he just
[1:15:59] restarted and remoulded the same he's
[1:16:02] going to do with this earth passing from
[1:16:09] one form to another the sound of freedom
[1:16:13] may freedom ring this weekend may
[1:16:18] freedom ring with everything that has
[1:16:20] got we can read the story as we close
[1:16:28] brother Brennan would tell Arnold bond
[1:16:30] Rico did hear the country wasn't
[1:16:35] hopeless and is surrounded on every side
[1:16:37] seem elated about to go down in defeat
[1:16:40] their families would be killed her homes
[1:16:44] would be lost their motherland destroyed
[1:16:46] nothing they could do
[1:16:48] it was hopeless but the sound of freedom
[1:16:52] sounded in a man about this tall and he
[1:16:57] said my brother this day I give my life
[1:17:00] for Switzerland what will you do
[1:17:04] he says down in the valley my little
[1:17:07] wife my children waited for me to come
[1:17:09] home but they won't see me again what do
[1:17:11] you want to do he said everyone who's
[1:17:13] got weapons follow me and do the best
[1:17:16] you can do everything you can with what
[1:17:19] you got with and he screamed as he threw
[1:17:21] up his weapon make way for liberty make
[1:17:27] way for liberty and he began to scream
[1:17:30] as he ran down to the thickest spears
[1:17:32] and he grabbed him and pulled him into
[1:17:34] his chance and said make way for liberty
[1:17:37] it was such a sound of freedom that is
[1:17:41] so energized of forces around them till
[1:17:43] they drove the army out of their pit
[1:17:45] bail them out of the country and they've
[1:17:47] never had a war since that day he said
[1:17:52] you think that was something he said I
[1:17:54] remember when the when Adam came down
[1:17:56] and he said I this day I give my life
[1:18:00] for my people make way for Liberty
[1:18:05] Magway for Liberty he went to the
[1:18:08] thickest of spears he went to the valley
[1:18:10] of the shadow of death and he grabbed
[1:18:13] every dart of the devil and he pulled it
[1:18:15] into his bosom and calls the church to
[1:18:17] say come on go with what you got praise
[1:18:20] God
[1:18:21] and he said on the day of Pentecost a
[1:18:23] rushing mighty wind fell out of heaven
[1:18:25] and armed every man with a weapon and he
[1:18:29] said whatever you got today break
[1:18:31] through the enemy's lines go as hard as
[1:18:34] you got with everything that you got
[1:18:37] make way for liberty make way for
[1:18:44] liberty he said this great warrior
[1:18:47] Christ has broke his way and he's put
[1:18:51] the enemy to the run he's put the enemy
[1:18:54] to run it is the scream of Jubilee
[1:18:58] it is an hour of Jubilee you don't have
[1:19:03] to serve the devil not one more day
[1:19:07] five more minutes is too long with the
[1:19:10] devil three more seconds is too long
[1:19:12] with the devil all you got to do tonight
[1:19:14] is throw that hoe down and say I'm not
[1:19:17] serving you not one more minute I'm
[1:19:20] going to serve the King of Kings and the
[1:19:23] Lord of lords make way for Liberty
[1:19:29] hallelujah
[1:19:33] as you hear those fighter jets in this
[1:19:37] day scream across these mountains I was
[1:19:43] over in Israel got the chance to go over
[1:19:47] there and see some of the things in the
[1:19:49] sights some wonderful moments but you
[1:19:53] hear those Jets screaming across sad now
[1:19:59] in Israel is not a very big country
[1:20:00] don't take very long to get across in
[1:20:03] the fighter jet but there was something
[1:20:06] about Israel we went to this one little
[1:20:09] place it was a little glass museum and
[1:20:13] there was this got done all kind of art
[1:20:16] out of glass and some some incredible
[1:20:18] sculptures but in this one room was the
[1:20:22] most ugliest hideous sculpture you ever
[1:20:24] seen in your life and it was
[1:20:26] representing the Holocaust and now
[1:20:30] Jewish woman stood there she gave us a
[1:20:32] tour she'd this said this right here
[1:20:34] says never forgive never forget and
[1:20:43] that's their cry today never forgive
[1:20:45] never forget why because they hadn't the
[1:20:50] head they don't know that Jesus we know
[1:20:52] they don't understand why it's all about
[1:20:54] what's why it happened the way it
[1:20:56] happened but it puts such a resolve to
[1:20:58] them that says they'll never be another
[1:21:02] Holocaust we'll never go to another
[1:21:05] death chamber will never walk down those
[1:21:09] streets to that gas chamber and give our
[1:21:11] lives of free
[1:21:12] we're gonna fight and they have gathered
[1:21:16] up every kind of technology whatever
[1:21:18] they can do and just daring somebody to
[1:21:21] do something they're ready they're ready
[1:21:27] for the moment they said but whatever
[1:21:30] we'll never go back
[1:21:33] when those men took those Jets here and
[1:21:36] flew them into the World Trade Center
[1:21:37] they couldn't do it again ain't gonna
[1:21:40] happen again
[1:21:41] no no they think will happen again
[1:21:43] because why there's gonna be somebody on
[1:21:46] them Jets when some guy stands up and
[1:21:47] says I'm gonna blow up something or I'm
[1:21:49] on there gonna be a whole group of guys
[1:21:51] jump on him guarantee you we ain't going
[1:21:55] back to that and it's time that we
[1:21:58] realized we're not going back to that
[1:22:01] we're not going back to cold dead
[1:22:04] formulism we're not going back to days
[1:22:07] pass and miracles of the past and signs
[1:22:09] and wonders are passed there's no more
[1:22:11] prophecies and no more if we're not
[1:22:13] going back to that if you want to go go
[1:22:15] ahead I ain't going but I will never go
[1:22:19] back because I've been given the
[1:22:22] greatest weapon that's ever been given
[1:22:25] to man it's the Holy Ghost it's the
[1:22:29] sounds of freedom may they ring this

[1:24:14] the temple was torn and the earthquake
[1:24:16] and the rocks were split and the graves
[1:24:18] were opened up why why did he die for us
