god bless you I would like to greet the church each and every one of you I'd like to thank you for every prayer that you have prayed for us in this very difficult journey God is our strength and our help we came through quite a bit we've got quite a long way to go I'd like for your continued prayers and God it's assembled an incredible team around us as our family and and give us incredible doctors and we thank God for everything that he's done I realize that I'm not alone in the battle but there's a great band of angels and great generals that are standing around us that are praying for us and I want to thank you for that I said also remember that we as a world are in very difficult times and and we realized that God is here with us and he's got this and he's our great provider we've read the scriptures so many times of Psalms chapter 23 and I just would just would like to share a couple of things with you the scripture says the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he made it me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside the still waters and it restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies and thou anointest my head with all of my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord our prophet would remind us of this all powers in heaven and in earth is given into our hands go and I'll go with you whatever you bind on earth I'll bind in heaven whatever you loose on earth elusive heavenly Joe one time was in quite a fix and much worse than I am and much worse than even us now shutting in our homes all over the world and when God came to Joe we didn't talk to him about having a pity party about how difficult the cancer was or how difficult the situation's was God took him into the heavens and begin to ask him were with huge oak when I laid the foundations of the earth when I created the mountains and the valleys and created all these things you see God had confidence in joke that he would go through the trouble whether we realize it or not worldwide God's got confidence in the bride there's not a better group of people that has been prepped and regretted with a token with the word of God anointed for this hour with a message that has prepared us for not just resurrection faith but for rupturing faith and I'm not just looking for God to heal my body I'm looking for God to change my body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I'm not just looking to just to go back to the church and we as a symbol ourselves as a private pieces but I'm looking for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and we minded with this he is the great provider and being that he's the great provider of eNOS for salt of malice so he's given us every weapon that we need in the arsenal of this world to meet the challenge of the power I truly had some good days and that's a really difficult days days that I never want to have to live through again days that I thought it was done and I ask God please don't let me down like this looking at goals in front of me with an incredible family and I realize how hopeless them and sometimes a hopeless that it is within my own humanity have realized that God has given me something within me his word that could reach that and know that he's given me something that will help me through this trial and it's then that I realized that he has drawn so close to me in this moment I realize that the footsteps of the righteous ordered of the Lord he has force all this time and this plate that it's come on the earth he has allowed things to happen there's nothing on occasion with God neither are there any surprises with God God let's not went into crisis modes like our government said he has prepared us as Christians he has prepared us as believers he has got us in his tenants there's not dangerous terror in crisis they're watching over us they're protecting us sure there comes sickness surely conquering sorrows sure there come find natural matters that we have difficult they will but we must remember Daniel was standing on the outside of a lines then and nobody had ever came out of there you see this is the place where people die net and no doubt God was watching over this God didn't go into crisis the king no doubt loved him and Daniel stepped into that lines in and told him I'll see you in the morning three Hebrew children went into a fiery furnace if there was always the fourth man that said the fun we must realize that whether it's Shadrach Meshach and Abednego or Daniel or Joseph we are fulfilling the Word of God in this day this is our table this is our moment whether we have the strength of the fortitude to get through it it's not up to us it's obtainable so we realize that maybe you can't come to my home you see it was in this home to work two great men of God Peyman pray for me that God would bring me peace in the midst of the storm and as they prayed God supernaturally touch me in peace ended and that peace never left me you see you could be sent great quotes and great scriptures and until he comes he makes all the difference when he puts the foot up on the bow of the boat and says it needs to be steel I've said it before and I'll say it again Jesus is on his way and there's nothing that Satan can do to stop him there's absolutely nothing that he can do to stop hiddenness trying to destroy this body this brought this people but god's got his hands on us i said this the other day and i'll say it again i've been sick before but i make it I've been broke before but I made it I've been brokenhearted before and made it a crowd all not but I made it I've been betrayed but I made it and live on that I made it I've been destitute but a minute I've been rejected but I've made it I read you one more scripture before finish we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he did also her destin8ion to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in who be called living also justified and whom he justified them he also gortat well shall we then say to these things if God people's who can be of instance he despaired not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died rather than is risen again who is even at the right hand of God making for us and I say at that point bhudev who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword or plague in despair cancer at this pumping whether it bring our lungs or lymph nodes are all over as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long and were accounted as sheep for the slaughter may and all these things were bullying than conquerors through him that loved us for hot lunch Spencer and persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities nor things present things to come height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord I want to tell you today I love you with all my heart thank you for your prayers for me god bless you amen boo devil boo devil I sent this I sent this message to dad this morning so today we show a clip of a preacher who hell has tried to rob from us a preacher who has not and will not back down a preacher yes a preacher of good news that Jesus still wins and Satan still loses yes he's a preacher he's my dad and he's my pastor and I'm glad to be under his under his sheepfold and for him to be leading us he has given us courage he has given us as a body of Jesus Christ he has given us his given us courage to face the battle with the sword in hand and to go forward if he'll would try to rob the leadership of the Lord from us how much more should we fight when we were writing up the prayer requests this morning that's why I wrote to be aggressive in your prayers do not back down we're seeing we are seeing God at his work but we will not back down in our prayers we will not back down in our faith we will not give up for anybody but much less our pastor but we will we will stand shortly on God's promises that joy is coming in the morning we know we know that we have God on our side and we know that God is with us and we will see miracles every day is a miracle enjoy the miracles of God that God has given to you enjoy every moment this trial has given us the ability to be able to stand and put ourselves in the shoes of others and to be able to pray like never before you know it there's some things that happen and come by your way that that you pray for but when you can really enter in for that person and enter into that interceding prayer then you can put yourself there and for them and you can see God move on the scene I thank God that he understands everything that we're going through and everything that we're facing and I'm thinking the Lord for nothing but full victory in this battle dad sent me word about a month and a half ago and I had told you all was a congregation brother ron was standing in that corner and I'm glad that brother ons in my corner he was standing in that corner as I get got ready to step out of this pulpit and he said show the devil no mercy for he's not so in me any so we as the bride of Jesus Christ we are showing the devil absolutely no mercy for we are coming after what is rightfully ours in the name of Jesus and you have to give it back Satan for we know exactly who we are and where we're standing at we certainly miss each and every one of you today and we bring you greetings and we love each and every one of you we we're thankful to be able to have this ability to be able to stream and be able to speak to you on this platform and we certainly miss each and every one of you and I know everyone here misses everyone but me specifically I I certainly miss each and every one of you I my heart goes out for you I know that you long to be in this building with us but due to regulations and whatnot we are not allowed to be here but we're thankful that the Lord can come to us and meet us in our home you know we're doing what we have done every single day of our life as Christians we're studying we're praying we're listening to this message and some people think it's a new thing to go and actually listen listen to a message at home but I've been doing that every every day ever since I became born-again but this is what we do in the midst of a battle we we we put on the armor and we put on the whole armor of God and we know we take the sword of the Spirit and we go against the enemy that has come against us like never before and that's why we should be in prayer that's why we should put on the whole armor that's why we should apply the token and be be ready for for such an hour as you think not the Son of man is coming and we are believing that it's just around corner and so we just prayed that God's peace and his healing angel would slip into your room and minister to you and that you may fall more in love with Jesus than ever before at this time I that's the group to come will will sing the song this morning as we get ready to go to the word a man [Music] I was hopeless and do hours lost death and darkness

trust you're not there setting in your lazy boy eating some popcorn this morning but trust you're ready for the word this morning amen if you have your Bibles this morning we'll turn over to the book of John chapter 4 verse 3 John chapter 4 and verse 3 before we before we read from the Bible this morning let's speak to the author of the word he sees each and every one of you where you're setting that and your homes listening maybe you'll go back and archive this and listen to it as you're headed to work and pray that wherever you are that God would minister to you every one of you that God would speak to you live to hear I've been very I don't know the word troubled or moved or inspired to speak on these things this morning and I asked for the help of the Lord that he would go directly to you to your need and speak I know that if I've been been under this burden that God has God has something to say so we want to be attentive and hear what he has to say father we come to you today by the way of Prayer father Lord we come before you Lord realizing Lord that we have access and boldness to your throne of mercy father and Lord we can come before you boldly and proclaim the name of Jesus Christ realizing there is life in that name there's wonder-working power in that name Lord Jesus we know that you're here and they you will never leave us nor forsake us father when the rest of the world is in chaos we can live in peace when the rest of the world is is walking in the graveyard and whistling and acting like they're not afraid father we can really walk in peace we can walk and rest assure that your promise said that no plague will not come now that dwelling father and Lord we plead the blood of Jesus Christ across the bride's life across our homes across our our family members father we want to do like Rahab Lord way as we apply that token we want to go and gather our gather our family gather our moms and dads or children our cousins and we want to bring them under that token father for we know that the the destroying angel is coming by the way and Lord we've received a commission a commission of the Lord to preach these things father and we stand here as shortly knowing that that you are here you're the one that sent us to do this work father you commissioned us or not to teach but to preach father and Lord you told us in your word that we're where the preaching of the word is that there is power and demonstrations of power father and we would pray today that you would demonstrate your glory amongst us father Lord as we lift up your name and lift up and speak the name of Jesus and speak the things of God we know that your word is anointed we pray that you would anoint your children as they're listening father Lord I pray that you'd speak to them in such a way that they would see that this same Jesus is alive today this same Jesus is wanting to slip into the room where they're at and minister to them maybe maybe they're in such a way that just like Jarius he had a need that you come by his way father Lord Jesus we know that you are to pass by this way you've walked this way before maybe we haven't walked this way maybe we haven't stepped through these through these corridors before but father you've down these aisles before you've walked in our hallways before you've walked in our you've walked in our day-to-day life you're already in our future you've already passed by the way so you've already went before us as the Bible said but the Angels shall go before thee to prepare the way to keep the in it father I pray that you would speak life to each and every one of us as the word would go forth I pray father that I get myself out of the way and you use me today and speak to your children in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen John chapter 4 and verse 3 I'd like to speak to you on this thought today come and see a man this this title is an announcement come see a man that God is with us we know the story very familiar but this is how the Lord has led me this week to look over these things and I don't believe that God would lead me in this manner if it did not have intentions to speak to you so come and see a man verse 3 he left Judea and departed again into Galilee notice his words and he must needs go through Samaria then he cometh to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey set us on the well and it was about the 6:00 hour and there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink where his disciples were going away under the city to buy meat then say if the woman help Samaria unto Him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me with them which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans and jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee give me the drink that I would have has asked of him and he would have given thee living water may God bless His Word he may be seated there in the presence of the Lord who said would like to speak to you on this thought on come see a man we look back in the times of the Bible that they were living in there that man was living in the traditions of the law and you could see and you could see that they were living there and they were trying to keep up that law and they were it was strictly a tradition for them it was strictly it had not be it was no longer worship but it was a tradition where man had man had lifted themselves up that that the high priest and the elders of the day were lifted up above all of the the surrounding ones and it had become a tradition and the traditions of God of man had become a stink in God's nostrils but here the Word of God had been made flesh amongst them the light of the day had come and was manifested in front of them and all of the scriptures that had promised them that there was a coming Messiah that was coming was now made manifest in front of them the light of the day was shining was shining upon the word itself and here it was the Word was made flesh but because they were so stupid in their traditions they missed what was going on they missed the light and it was what it was it was blinding to them you see but it was lighting the paths to other that they might see that there was a man that had came to turn on the light that there was a man that had come to to fulfill all of the Scriptures now these men they had no ability in themselves to be able to keep the law and to obey every every jot and tittle as it were they had no ability in their own self to be able to keep the law but here was the one who was the law he was the one that you see you see the law was to them and put them in the jail house but there was no mercy that would set them free from the jail house but here the word of the hour was coming upon their lives and shining upon their lives and to those that were were that received it and saw that light they were set free from their bondage of traditions and bondage of their sins for they realized that this was the one that was promised to come the Prophet said that life is only by the Word of God made manifest life comes only by the Word of God made manifest and he said as long as it's just in the book like this it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest then you see the product of what I speak of being manifested then that light then that is the light on the word you see that light on the word brings it it brings the product that was spoken out and here the light of the hour was shining upon them and they they that were they that were awakened to it could see that this was the one that was promised I'm so thankful that we have been awakened in this hour to see that this same Jesus it's the same one that was there with Moses in the burning bush there with Moses as he led the children of Israel and that same pool of fire as leading his children across today and we look and we see that this is the same man the same God he has dispersed himself and we could truly say as a church that God is with us we can say that God is with us and the announcement is come see a man so we look at the natural and we see we see this at this panoramic or this scene that has set before us this morning we look at the woman that had been to this whale many times she'd walked up to Jacob's Well and she'd went through this routine day in and day out but we find what was driving this woman to the whale is that she was looking for a source she was looking for a source of water and here the Bible says that that Jesus was wearied and wanted a drink but Jesus was not led there because of the natural abilities or the natural things that were causing him to go by that whale but yet the man part was wearied and he desired a drink but Jesus was not led because it was easier to walk a different path and go but Jesus was allowed to go by the way of Samaria you see because he had a need that he'd go by that way he had a need that he an passed mile that way and I want you to hear this that Jesus has got a need today to go by your way he may come to your will this morning and speak life to you if you just be ready to receive that there's a man that is standing at night well waiting for you to think that the Son of Man was standing there he was waiting on her he was not led by his natural causes to go and have a drink yet he does desire those things but he was led by the spirit to go by Samaria he was led by that way to go because you see God had shown him a vision that he had a need go by that way and you see that this message has shown a vision that he's got a need to come by your way you see he's not going to leave you where you're at he's not going to leave you in your condition he's not gonna leave you in your sickness he's not gonna leave you in your fear he's not gonna leave you in your term or he's not gonna leave you in your distress he's got a need to come by you it's the enemy that wants to keep you in house and in Kate's and envelopes in fear and distress in those things but Jesus is coming Jesus is on his way you heard it from our pastor this morning you've been anointed 4 and Jesus is on his way you've been anointed and there as a predestinated spot for you to stand in there's a predestinated spot for you to stand in and you're coming to that spot and Jesus is coming to that spot I'd say that there's a meeting that is taking place there's a meaning of the Son of Man that's coming by your way and the son of man came by and he read to her there's very secrets of the heart and the son of man is by your way I want you to prepare yourself get ready he's coming to your address this morning he's coming by your way because Jesus has got a need we think we got a need but Jesus has got to need this morning notice thirst is what drove her there and thirst here is what Webster says it's a plain for desire a painful when you want something so bad until it becomes painful to you to think that this desire had driven her to this whale or was it the plan of God you see it was a painful desire that was driving her there you see it's not unnatural it's not an act or the thirst thirst is a natural thing it's just simply something that God has given us that we we could give we could to give us a desire for something sometime God has also has given you a control tower that sets inside of you that controls these different desires and this thirst this control tower that sets in a man's heart it's something that God give him to warn him of the desires that's needful for him so God has placed in you and your own human abilities in your whole in your whole makeup there are certain things that God has placed in you that will warn you that that when you start getting those hunger pains that you need to feed on something or when you start getting that thirst for that part or that part throat that it's something that's warning you it's telling you that you need a drink and it's something that's on the inside of your body that is making you desire for those things you see God made each of us to thirst after him he made each of us to run after him and only he will satisfy that portion that he has placed on the inside of us God made us a thirst for him but Satan he perverts the true nature of God and the true thirst of God of the body and soul by lust for sin sin a perversion now we find out a person today the way they they've took that perversion thirst for God the thirst for them to be pretty and all these thirst for water they've turned that into satisfying that with drinking the thirst for Joey everybody wants to have joy first-first fellowship and all these great thirsts that God puts into us that we might thirst after him God made you to thirst after him and we try to satisfy it with some other kind of a thirst with some of the kind of a perversion of of the correct thirst see how it's in the natural see how it's in the spiritual so we look at these things that that there's something as you long to be in church you've been shut in you've been shot in there something that makes a believer long to be in there because the Prophet told us that every time those doors are open a believer wants to be there but you have been shot in because a virus there's something on the inside of you that makes you thirsty be in the church because you longed to be there where the glory of the Lord is you want to be on the end of the spout as the joys of the Lord are coming out you want to be right there you long to be there something has blocked you from receiving your thirst but I want to tell you that's a man that's on its way you see you see now if a person feels secure and they feel that they're safe or feel that they're okay they never want to come out of that spot they feel that they they don't need to be saved or they feel that they don't need to be delivered that's a person that you cannot get to if that person feels in that way they'll stay right there in that condition if they feel like they've got everything they need huh they'll stay right there and that can be but if a person is thirsty to be set free this body is groaning to be set free this body is groaning for a body change you see because something is thirsting in that realm you see it's something that Satan would love to keep me from thirsting or a believer from thirsting for but God put that there and it is such a thirst for him that no matter what Satan tries to throw he may troll and try to blow all kinds of winds here and try to dry out the church but there is an old-fashioned pouring out of the Holy Ghost that had come across you and make you fresh and make you flexible to the things of God it makes you thirst for the things of God but you see if a person's in the condition that they don't feel like they need to be set free they'll stay in that condition over in France when when the wars were going on there was a there's a prison there it's a famous prison the name of it is the Bastille prison and they had came in and they had conquered that prison and they were going to destroy that prison no man would be locked up again and so they let all the they let all the prisoners out of of the prison but there was this one man that wouldn't leave and so they let him out and told him said look we're going to destroy this prison and this man had been in there so long he'd been in there with murderers and convicts and all types of different different evildoers he'd been in there most of his life but this person he come out he'd been so bound up in darkness so long that he just when he come out it was hard on him the light was hard on him that it affected his eyes when his eyes adjusted he looked out across the city he didn't recognize the city as it was when he went in there many years before he didn't recognize the people on the street that were there many years before and he spoke to the old God he spoke to the men that were leading him out and says take me back in oh everything's changed around me I let me die with this prison I don't know I don't know anything that's going on out in the world let me die with that prison and they destroyed that prison and he died with that prison I say what a sad state for a man to be so locked up in darkness that he cannot receive light and that's what the Satan has done my other traditions of men he's locked them up so long that they cannot receive the light of this day when there's a man that is here to turn on the light he told us don't you fear a little sister there's an engineer there that's got his hand on the switz it may be talking us all about you but don't you be afraid there's a man that can turn on the light who see man was made to live and long for God and this woman's life had been so corrupted by sin so marred by sin the Prophet said in redic sin and completeness and joy he said there was a woman that came out from Samaria one time she was discouraged she was sinful had a lot of things hanging on her life perhaps she was discouraged she went to Jacob's Well for relief and she'd go back and she go to Jacob's Well and go back and one day she said the water plopped down and there was standing there discouraged I think I've just described every one of your lives but that day was a different day for her there that day that's to the rock standing boggler there have been many times that you walk to these church services and you walk to the house of God or walk to the well of God but one time when you walked up there and there was a rock that could not stop flowing that was standing there one time in his presence changed you it made you to be the man and son and daughter of God that God wanted you to be whoo you walk through life you were discouraged you were tore up things have happened to you and nobody understands all the pain that you've been through you've been through scars you've been through torments and he nobody had losses like you had ain't nobody had went through struggles like you had but one day there stood a man my whale and to think that this man was so we read in his physical frame that he was setting on the whale that you'd been to many times you'd walk to that well many times you walk 2-player you look at the well you've seen the scenery before but you ain't seen this man before but when you come into this meaning you see it set all the meeting is set upon thirst the conference is set upon thirst you'd watched it you've seen when you are we're not allowed to go up there with all the other women in the cool of the day because of your life because of the things that you had hanging on your sin upon your life you had become discouraged you have become distraught because of all of the things that were hanging under your life you couldn't go to the well with everybody else there was a man that was willing to come to the well with you mark the spot that he came to you I believe it's very important to us that we mark the spot that he came to us and we don't forget the things that were done at that spot that he spoke a life to us and ministered to us because it's in that spot that there's something that is prolific in the spot that he comes to you after you watch the place you watch the place that you are born in everything has a name to it and notice the spot that the woman had the whale came to him this was a remarkable spot in the scriptures firstly being that where Abraham first stopped on his coming from her on to Canaan secondly he was where God first appeared to Abraham and promised him to give the land to his seed I'd say it was a very important spot but thirdly it was a place where Abraham first built an altar to the Lord and called upon his name this spot was a very special spot to the patriarch Abraham and this woman could point back and she could say that our forefathers worshiped in this mountain but this spot was more than just a place of past worship this was a spot of a renewal this same piece of property was a piece of property that Jacob had balked he was a piece of property that you can look over in the Bible in Genesis 33 and see that when Jacob bought this piece of property for a hundred pieces of money and the Bible said that he erected there an altar and called it any he hello he is a rail which means being interpreted the strong God which means the Covenant God of Israel you see God had made a promise that the Messiah was coming that a strong one was coming and here on that day in history the strong God that covenant God the God that keeps his promises showed up for the woman that was sitting by a whale she was in a special spot she was in a spot of deliverance and to think that Jesus would say that I know Abraham before Abraham was I am and she's standing in a spot that was destined for her to stand in you see up to this spot all the things in her life had been misery she'd fell in love with men me and it broke her heart she'd felon thing fell in love with the things of the world and the things of the world there are beautiful the joys of the Lord maybe you fell in love with cigarettes or maybe you fell in love with alcohol maybe you fell in love with the wrong type of lover maybe you fell in love with all types of different sinful things but there's a man that's sitting on the well today he made a promise that he was coming this strong God is a God that's coming by your way this strong God is a God that knows what you're spending at this is a clever God that will not back down on his promises you think about today and we we started out this journey of separation and social distancing and the president asked for 15 days but now we've gone on to June the 10th now we've got a day ahead of time if God don't intervene or come and wrap for us we're gonna have to worship this way for quite some time until God gives us some relief from this thing and I'm praying even so now but see even the president the most powerful man in the nation cannot even keep his own word but here the strong God that's able to keep his promises that's able to reach her life will speak lips a year to you you're standing on a piece of property and the place that you're standing on his holy ground this property was a piece of property that Joseph his bones were buried in his bones were buried in in this this same piece of property that this woman was standing on thousands of years later when the children of Israel came out of Egypt Joseph had made them a commission that if I die down here in Egypt don't you leave my bones down here in Egypt if I go by the way of the grave here don't you leave my bones down here don't you bury me down here in some creed don't you bury me down here in this cosmos but you take me to a lay in the promised - well that's a strong one that's coming Larry the resurrection in the life is coming and Joseph as Joseph said these things and the children of Israel walk past that thing they can lay their hands over on that casket and said that we've been promised by a strong one that we're coming out of this land who don't you leave my boats out here don't you get buried in some Trinitarian baptism where there is no resurrection don't you be buried in some trucks world ISM you'd be buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be buried in the promise she was standing at a spot where Joseph knew that there was one coming she was standing at a spot where Joseph knew that the resurrection and the life was coming she was standing on a piece of property and owned that same piece of property where Abraham worship the son of man was standing there who you've stood in this spot before but this time it's different when you look as Jesus passes by and John chapter five five and he passes by the Pool of Bethesda and here he is he's doing the works of the Father and because he does the works of the Father and he heals on the Sabbath that the Pharisees of the day they sought to stone him but Jesus turns to them and he says the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth if the father do for what thing soever he doeth these also the son likewise and Jesus said believe me because the works sake he said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me you see they were looking for the Messiah to come in a different manner and do the works in a different manner but here Jesus was doing the works of the Father and they would not believe him because the works sake they would not believe him because they were expecting him to come in a different manner but here the all-knowing God the omniscient God was making himself known to a little woman to a little woman with the Scarlet past he was manifesting himself to a woman not a Pharisee not to the teachers of the day but a thirsty vessel was he revealing himself too and I want you I don't don't miss these events that are transpiring here the things that have led up to the moments of scars the complexes she's not able to walk to the whale with everybody else she's rejected by everybody else her past relationships had led her to this spot she was walking alone because of her career and this little woman she know that her days was about finished up her occupation would be ruined you understand what I say so she was thinking about what would I do but she said you know I've always thought that some day there might be the Messiah come she was walking up there and it's usually when you're thinking about him when he comes along so she walked up layer darkness all the women was gone away she was immoral couldn't speak with them or nothing had the hooks and she let the window down and she started she heard a man say go call your husband come here Bible says in John 4:12 are thou greater than our fathers Jacob which gave us as well and drink thereof of himself and his children and his cattle and jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I should give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life the woman saith unto him Sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come the hitherto draw and Jesus ain't saving her go call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and said I have no home and husband and jesus said unto her thou has well said that I have no husband for thou has had five husbands he whom thou now hast is not thy husband and in this thou says now truly say it's thou truly and the woman said sir I perceive thou art a prophet you see you look at this event that is transpiring here that he's not calling out to the theologians of the day but he's calling out to a woman that has a need he's calling out to a woman and here she watches as Jesus reveals the secrets of her heart to her he tells her he does not tell her all things but he tells her her trouble he tells her where she's troubled at that same one will tell you where your troubles at that same one will speak to you where your troubles at and minister life to you he won't leave you in that trouble spot he won't leave you in a time of trouble for in a time of trouble he will hide you in his pavilion you see the Jews would receive one that could reveal the secrets of the heart because the Prophet had told him I say ya 11:01 that there shall come for the rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots notice and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord shall rest upon him so they were looking for one that could reveal the very secrets of their heart and discern the things of the heart and here the son of man was revealing this woman's heart and the Prophet told us that the ability to discern the hearts thoughts and men made the elect of God to understand that here was the messiah the anointed Word of God what have we you and I we received today this has been him speaking this has been more than just a man that has come to your address and called you out I see you I see you you're sitting there in the hospital room and I see you you've been you've been dr. Don and it's a it's a fat doctor that's working on you and he's told you that you're going to die with this but that says the Lord you said that da band live who was this that was speaking for the Bible tells us in Hebrews are now four and twelve that the word of God is quick this has been the word that is alive that is speaking to us and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of the sonder of soul in a spirit and of the joints and the marrow and the discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart this is he that is speaking that same God that spoke back there in the wilderness is the same one that spoke there that this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased to dwell when John the Baptist was there baptizing on the Jordan River as he's standing there and he's baptizing them under repentance and he said that i baptize you with water unto repentance but there's one coming after me that's mightier than I and I am not worthy to bow down and unloose the straps off of his sandals i baptize you with water but the one that is coming will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire john was introducing the Messiah and in the second coming of Christ there has been one that has introduced us to the one that has baptized us with Holy Ghost and with fire he did not point to himself he was pointing to the man Jesus for there is no other mediator given unto us between man or God but the man Jesus Christ that man bore your stripes that man this coming week walked up the heels and one day they're screaming Hosanna to the king and the next week they're spitting on him that man did it for you that man had to in his mind that man when he was taken across had you on his mind when he had a need to go by the will of Samaria it was because of one put it didn't just stop with one it led to many what has he been doing and lighting the torch fires he's been lighting one and you watch as that fire grows who you see all the events that led her to this spot I think God does everything will God does everything perfectly all of the events that had transpired in her life led her to this crucial moment you see if she was there in that condition of a Pharisee she would have missed it but this was a woman that was in a spot of discouragement who could say that she was shot in she was isolated she was quarantined from everybody around her nobody wanted to be near her they thought that she might have some kind of disease that would pass on to somebody else nobody wanted to be around her but this man Jesus this man Jesus thought who thought that she was worth going out away for this here would have been easier for Jesus to go another way he had been now he'd walked those paths before he knew the layout of the land he was the one that created that land but this man was so the son of God that he was led by the Spirit of husbands and the one you're now living with she played the part of a harlot she had been marred up by sin she'd been corrupted men had let her down but the one that was sitting on that whale would not let her down he would be with her even in her to the end of the world there were men that would come in and would abuse her but this man was coming in to love her that was men that would come in and would take her that would take her and destroy her virtues but this man was restoring her virtues back to her look at what this man has done to the body of Jesus Christ he's not stripped you down but he's built you up come and see a man that has restored the glory to the Church of Jesus Christ this same Jesus is walking on the water to you hallelujah Satan makes you think that you don't win too far but I want to tell you the blood goes further Satan wants to tell you that she can't get it but Jesus says you can get it Satan wants to tell you that you can't be filled with the Holy Ghost but he said that this promise is unto you and then your children as many as the Lord our God shall call and he's still calling Oh hallelujah Satan says you can't got no right to sit there Satan says she guilty but yet a prostitute was sitting and a well with God she was rejected by the other women she was rejected by the morals of the men that were living in that city but here she was accepted by the Messiah the mighty one the strong water the one that would make away for her what men had rejected her he would stand up for her wouldn't men and women would turn their back from her turn their nose at her not looking her in the face this man stood up for her that same man stood up for me and you I'm not gonna stand for myself he stood up for me and the moments that I thought I was truly standing it was only that he was holding me up sometimes when the battle gets too tough that's when he's ever so close that's when he's got his arms so completely around you and he's still standing up for you he stood up for you 2,000 years ago and he's still standing and looking revelations 10 and you see the mighty angel standing with a foot on the land and the foot on the sea that man has told you and gave your message he gave you a message hello run your right straight into a rapture right straight into her body change he stood up for you you look back at the fall when reasoning had got the best of he when she leaned to her own understanding when she did not trust him what God said but she leaned to her own understanding and her own understanding got her in trouble Adam stood up for her hallelujah hallelujah why because she was a part of heat and there was no way that Adam was going to allow Eve to be destroyed because she was a part of him and Satan thinks he's got the best of you and thinks he's going to rob you and kill you and he may give you a cancer he may pin you in the car he may pin you with the disease but how can he rob you how can he destroy you when you are a part of him you can't do it there's one that stood up for me and he stood up for you come and see a man in the bridge the Prophet said now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original holder Almighty God the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited then Satan start his hands could not take it so he went back to the original owner God himself you see Satan when this when this transaction was taking place Satan tried to reach over there and grab ahold of your name he tried his best to grab a hold onto your life but that was a bo asset stood up for you there was a redeemer that stood up for you who you can rest a little Ruth there's one that's bigger than you don't know worry just rest in the promise he stood up for you he'll pay for you he'll redeem you hallelujah he'll redeem you and redemption means to buy back and it searched all the way back he searched it all the way back through your ancestors and all the way down through your DNA chain and there's no sickness you may have dealt with sickness in your life your family may have died with fish or died with that but the title deed says that you are redeemed you are not locked into a DNA chain of men that will destroy your vessels you're locked into a blood cell that's the very life of Jesus Christ that is greater than sickness that's greater than sin that's greater than torment that's greater than any temptation this blood this blood stands for you whoo hallelujah there was a gap there was a gap between between men and God but in this day there has been a blood there has been a token there has been a lamb that bridged the gap from God to humanity and you can walk across that bridge you can go across there go and look in the message look and you'll see when brother branham tells us that God bridged the gap there was somebody that stood up for you there was a great chasm that stood between you and God but all the blood of Jesus hold the blood of Jesus he can't destroy you because when he looks upon you he don't see you he don't see your need he sees his son he sees those stripes that he gladly took a pilot's judgment when they would take the cat-o'-nine-tails and they would rip from him his flesh and the blood would gush from him come see me little hem of God it takes away the sin have you they can't have one Harrier hit he can't touch your life I love what the Prophet said and in future home when he reads when he reads what Jesus said over in the book of Matthew the heaven earth will pass away but my word will never pass away and the Prophet looks into that word pass away it means to change and the Prophet said a paragraph one eighty he said the earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loosed it'll be loosed from politics it'll be loosed from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdoms of God to be established here on the earth but as long as it's in the hands of Satan Satan the rule of the earth he owns it he belonged to him but now Christ has redeemed it one time I was his property but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now see he come to loosen the grip of it he loosed the group of sin the grip of sin of Satan upon the hope of my life upon your life and now we're not here have you often heard me say in prayer take your hands off of God's property have faith to claim your own that's your rights take your hands over her take your hands off of him see faith will do it faith will do that Oh am I not even i elated but take your hands off of to loosen learn let it go pass it away it changes the earth will change politics will change the religions will change denominations will pass away but tyre politics will pass away but the kingdom of God shall be established everything will pass away but this kingdom that you have received is a kingdom that cannot be sucked down it is established it is the kingdom of God Oh hallelujah I love what the Prophet said he said the earth redeemed goes back to its original owner he took it from Satan he pulled and taken the earth away from Satan just just like he took you away from Satan Alleluia just like he took you away from Satan like he took that little woman after well away from Satan he took her away from Satan how he'll hates that out of all the trillions of people he chose her and of all the trillions and billions of people he chose you when there was looking like somebody that was more qualified he chose you when there looked like somebody that knew more scripture than you he chose you when you didn't know which way to go he tells you when you were scarred up he chose you when you were messed up he chose you hallelujah hell has messed up hell has messed up by putting his hands on God's property they have no legal right because you don't belong to sin you don't belong to Satan you belong to God and he took you away from Satan just like he took the woman a well away from Satan how hates hell hell hates that he'll has to hate that you see because that day he'll lost ten thousand worlds oh I hope you follow me he'll lost ten thousand worlds that day the Prophet said that once those worth ten thousand worlds you think about the value that Satan lost that day when when Jesus came and took her away from Satan how much more how much more as he looked across this body of Jesus Christ that he redeemed you Hale has lost thousands upon thousands upon millions of worlds when he'd win Jesus took you away from Satan he took you away from Satan you don't belong to Satan but he looses the grip of Satan all of this transpired because the man we read and the man desired a trick woman give me the trinket the man part was weird but the God part said I will give you everlasting water that's how beyond me inside of you a water that's an ever untried it'll spring up into everlasting water notice the man part Jesus was wearied but the God part had dispersed something on the inside of her you see thirst drove her there and there was an eternal seed that was laying there on the inside of her and notice the atmosphere that was created on that piece of property that brought to life this would a woman it was her seed but it was his force that called that seat up Oh hallelujah you remember when he came by your way and you heard his voice speak for the first time we read over these scriptures we know about the Messiah we know about these things but for the very first time that he shows himself openly that I am the Messiah he speaks to a woman of ill-fame you think about that think about this woman think about all the things that were against her think about her life think about the things that were stacked up against her but she was the very first one there's been other denominations there's been greater maybe greater sisters that look greater in stature but you're the first one you're the first one that has been able to testify come and see a man that he promised that there was coming and returning a Malachi 4 and you are the wards that are testifying that this is the day it was his voice but it was your seed brother Jeffrey it was your seed that he calls come awaken to the voice when his voice speaks it brings life you can go back over the moments that you were standing in your spot and you were enclosed with fear you were enclosed with captivity of bondage but they came one he told her of her sins he revealed her secrets said I would receive your prophet and all of a sudden she begin to get religious said I fathers worshipped here and they told us that there was a messiah coming and he turns to her and says i that speak unto thee i am he you could imagine the shock wave this sent he starts reading to her her life and he starts describing to her the intricate details we only know what is placed out here and he didn't tell her all things but he told her we're in trouble of us you can imagine he sees reading her life she's having a personal interview was the great I am and she forgets the very purpose that she's there sometimes you walk to church and you got your own selfish motives why you're going to church you're going to receive the benefits of being a Christian sometimes you got your own selfish motives but one day when it comes and says I'll that speak to thee and he you can remember the spot that when he spoke to you that he turns your life around just like a magnet Redemption has two parts it has it has two parts it pulls you away it pulls you to God and pushes you away from the world and you can remember the day that Redemption began to work in your life and you went out and you said come and see a man that has told me the very secrets of my heart it's not this the very Christ she did not allow her complexes she did not allow her fears she did not allow her her her quarantine or isolation to keep her from testifying you see the blood was greater than her the blood is greater than your fear the blood is greater than its coronavirus that's trying to keep you sunny and from testifying that there's a living God amongst us that's what Satan's trying to do is trying to keep you so in Houston that you'll stop spreading this gospel oh he don't even realize what he's doing the more were shut in he don't realize who you'll realize who was shut in with was shut in with Jesus there's somebody on the inside of this house hallelujah and he came by Jairus his way one day and he brought life to a dead girl and he has come by this house there was a little girl laying there and worse at him with Jesus and there's life in the house Satan ain't got a clue what he's doing but there's a people that's coming out they're opening up the doors in saying come and see a man come and see a man you see when the master was there he told her the very secretive thing that was keeping her from her liberties hello he told her the very secret things that was keeping her from her liberties are being totally set free to worship she didn't have to go up to the temple to worship she didn't have to go and pay her penance she didn't have to go up to some high priests but jesus said the hour is coming when they that worship must worship in spirit and in truth I say let the worshipers arise for this is the hour and he has come and he's revealed the various secrets of your heart and he's given you the liberties to worship will you accept those liberties we had set those Liberty to run free and testify that there's a Living God you justified say come see man you see that word come when there are travelers going across in a dancer they send out scouts and they're riding out on the cross in their camels and they're sent off in every direction to scour through the country and look for Springs of water when these when these are discovered when they find those Springs of water the founder immediately calls aloud come come and it reaches over to this one and this one repeats it come and then he spreads it to this one come and before long all of the ones that have dispatched to go out and find that spring of water are then setting out the well once they heard the word come they gathered at the well what about us has Christians we must do the same for we have found the well of living waters and we must raise the cry don't be afraid there's a virus out there but come to it see a man that's greater than the virus that's greater than your fear that's greater than your sickness that that's greater than your torments nature tells us that when honey bees go out when honey bees go out they go out and they're looking for a spot of honey and they go out and they they find that spot and as soon as they find that spot they go back and they go back to the nest where they came from and they start testifying that they have found a source of honey what about us that have found the honey in Iraq how much more so we'd go about and testify come and see a man that is testified to me and reveal the very secrets for me if a bee can do it what about us his sons and God you use Facebook Facebook for everything else hits the gram for everything else why don't you start testifying and stop telling about how many people didn't seek and how many people died once you start testifying about how many that's living how many that's going to overcome we don't know the number but there's a body that's coming out if a bee can testify honey how much more is us its sons and daughters of God testify theirs living God here whoo
