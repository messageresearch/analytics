I'm sure she's 29 so you will share that so I'm pleasure amen have a prayer request we want to go to this morning from sister Brenda her HR Manager has a situation with her adopted daughter and he has an incredible need and so she would like a prayer cloth and maybe you have a need across his audience now great or small [Music] I too have a need Heavenly Father I can imagine as your great disciples

you'd send this prayer [Music] touch and do a work for them Lord she sing the life sister Brenda others that are there Lord we ask you that you minister to that need Lord you see the hands that are up I tune have a need I pray that you would touch us today if you would sweep by our way one touch from you would make all the difference in the world many needs come in from all over the world we ask you that you'd send your word and heal them Father today Lord we lay it into your hands and we just have to leave it there and we ask you now that you would speak to our hearts anoint the lips of your speaker the body of your speaker not only the speaker today but also the hearer Lord many have traveled great distances to be in this service I ask you that you would bless them may they already have felt your presence here this afternoon touch us today we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen and amen Gabriel will you pass that to sister Brenda and me God bless you what an incredible service last night I know you were blessed I was blessed I when I saw Andrew speaking on when Jesus was at its weakest I could I could kind of understand and so we are we're very I just I just was quite moved by that and so I so enjoyed that Andrew thank you so much I enjoyed last week when when Hallelujah brain's not working William preached on counting the cost amen that cost goes a couple different ways amen and so sometimes we think well I've counted the cost in serving the lord and it's cost me a lot what if you don't went the other way it would have been a tremendous cost in it would have not only cost you but it cost you generations and so we thank you for that I'm a bit weak this morning thought something all week and and so if you would just pull with me we'll we will try to bless you in some way I'd like to speak to you on a new Administration I've never never went this way but the Lord I was going to preach this at Ohio and the Lord changed my mind there we had a wonderful meeting and then and then where this is what we get today so amen we just pray that it will be a blessing to you we'd like to welcome brother Joel and Sister Sarah they've made some thoughts of coming our way and so we we welcome you and I know it's some bitter sweetness that is involved there and God is moving in a lot of directions and so we pray that God would just help you in your move with jobs and homes and and schools and all of those kinds of things and so we welcome you here and we thank you I I so I so love both of your fathers and ones in Ohio one's in North Carolina God bless you we we love you we'll do our best to Pastor you and uh and so we'll do we'll do our best and so amen God rich in his Mercy give me a little bit longer time I'll do my best and if he takes me home Andrew will do his best and so that's the way we look at it don't we amen if you will look with me in Proverbs chapter 42 and verse 1 you'll quickly recognize this as a text for the Deep colath to the Deep the reason I want to read this scripture is because brother Branham is standing in one of the greatest Halls of the United States of America it's a building of phenomenal importance and as you saw last night I didn't know that that was going to be played but as you saw last night before the service the prayer line to which that even brother Garber brother Garber from our area was praying for Revival brother Branham preaches a deep calls to the Deep I'm thankful when I'm saying this that you have a deep on the inside of you that is calling for more and that means that deep inside of you as it's calling for more means there's more for us and so amen as the heart paneth after the water Brooks so panteth my soul after thee oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God my tears and my meat and night day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy God when I remember these things I pour out my soul in thee and I have gone with the multitude I have went with them to the house of God and with the voice of joy and praise and with a multitude that keep holy day why art thou cast down O my soul and why aren't thou disquiet it in me hope thou in God for I shall yet Praise Him for the help of his countenance oh my God my soul is cast down Within Me therefore will I remember thee in the land of Jordan and of Hermes and in the hill of my czar deep calleth unto the Deep at the noise of thy water spouts all thy waves and Billows are gone over me Revelations chapter 21 and verse 1. this is a vision that is yet to be fulfilled but we're a part of it and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done notice these next words I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and I give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely and you remember what we just read psalms 42. and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son you may be seated today in Saint John chapter 1 and verse 1 John is under the eagle anointing so he looks at Matthew Mark Luke and John are the four guards to the temple each one of them are anointed in a different way but John as he's writing he's under a prophetic anointing an eagle anointing and notice how he begins to say it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with god notice these words all things were made by him and without him was not anything that was made made that was made Saint John chapter 14. now this is Jesus turning to his disciples and he's and he's operating under this Administration notice what he says let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions no man could say these words quite like he was saying there wasn't another man on the earth could say these words he's the author of the book in my father's house are many mansions brother Brown said he was not talking about brick and mortar he said if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I'd go and prepare a place for you I will come and again receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also I like that don't you he's not saying might be also or or even an if because let me let me just say this to you when he said let there be a son did it not come to pass let there be a universe did it not come to pass when he began to say let there be light did it come to pass so when he says there you may be also it will come to pass and whether I go you know and Thomas saith unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus saith unto him I am the way quite a bold statement nobody else could say that like that I am the way there's no other way other than Jesus many ways but here's the way and the life and no man cometh to the father but by me and if you'd known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him in Matthew chapter 12 and verse 23 he's going to talk about Two Worlds or two kingdoms and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of David but when the Pharisees heard it they said this fella doth not cast out Devils but by Beelzebub the prince of devils they identified where they were from by the reaction that they had are you with me now this nation has identified where she's headed to by the reaction of how she treated her prophet and Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them every Kingdom divided it against itself is brought to Desolation every city or house divided against itself shall not stand and if Satan cast out Satan he is divided against his health and how shall then his kingdom stand and if I by be also Bob cast out Devils by whom now notice he pins them now by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you there came a dispensational change if I if I cast them out by the kingdom of God and you know where you're standing you call me Beyonce Bob and I am from God or else how can one enter into a strong house a man's house and spoil his Goods except he buying the strong man he's going to explain the new birth or else how can a one enter into a strong man's house spall these Goods except he first bind the strong man and then he spall his house he that is not with me is against me and he gathereth not with the scattered abroad we have watched if you've got any age to you at all you have watched different administrations come there's some order of how they do it the precedent of course has all of these men and all of his staff and mostly when a president is elected there's a certain party that that takes a halt there's a certain inspiration that grabs and many of those people and then a new leader comes in and especially if it's from a different party there's a transition of power generally about 30 days the older president brings the the newly elect President up to Oregon and he he privies him to secrets that are going on in the Earth things that the average citizen no way should be able to know and and he brings him to the order of different leaders all over the world and and he begins to tell them that this is going on in a certain country and these this country's receiving nuclear power or this economy is falling apart and he begins to tell them how that he's done business so that the transition of power goes from one to another and then on the day there's an inauguration and there's a speech that is given there's a swearing in and and literally tens of thousands of people will watch the new rise of the leader and so brother Branham or even our our scripture tells us that God calls men to rise and he causes them to fall now we must remember that this world is ruled by Satan it's ruled by Satan we're we're only citizens of another kingdom we fly our flag because we identify it as this nation and we we identify brother Brown will use the term I'm proud to be an American I'm I'm proud of and he said I I stand with her inner in her strength and I stand with her in her shame but he would also call this nation a rotten Nation a corrupt government and so we realize that men as they rise the more corrupt that they get it is because influence of power is pushing them in a certain direction now God allows these men I'm not telling you your vote don't have a account but God causes these men to come on the scene at a certain time boy presidents rise and fulfill a vision because of the Catholic church is rising and it's on its move and in this nation today we can see that seeds are now fulfilled where we have a where we have a court system that is basically ruled by the Catholic Church we have a precedent that is a Catholic man but we notice the influence of the people around him he has placed people in so many directions of his own cabinet that represents Sodom transgender it represents because it's saying that this is the influence Over America in this day I say those things and I say this the reason that they could come to that spot is because they turned down the message [Music] they they turned down the message to where that pulpits became weak all across America the the the the Ten Commandments are no longer hung in so many of our courtrooms it's it's no longer hung in our nation's capital it's no longer prayer taking place in our in her great Halls of Congress we're not a Christian Nation anymore we may pray here and have the Liberty to preach the way that we preach but even in that you got to use a little common sense with it because we're preaching to the world now and so you understand that we recognize Sodom is here but I must let you know that we're no longer Church [Music] you see Messengers have came the Apostle Paul was a new Administration and so he took the scriptures and wrote basically 14 books of the Bible and laid out how the church should be in order are you with me when when Andrew read Hebrews chapter 12 last night Paul was looking for the Rapture to take place at any time and he would scream let us run but just a few said we have come to the Mount Zion so they were under expectation of rapture at any moment but you see that was only the first part of the book there must come Messengers all the way down through men of incredible influence hand-picked by God irenius brother random even in his own nature would have picked polycarp but God picked iranias Saint Martin whom brother Branham says that had more miracles than even Jesus Christ are you with me raise more back to life had a phenomenal Ministry these men shook the Earth Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost was poured out at Azusa Street God poured his Spirit out but remember in Daniel the book had been sealed and the Mysteries would be revealed to the Bride of Jesus Christ and it would call for a new Administration because basically churches and and Prophets and and reformers would rise but the Revival would only last for a short time and men would get into it organize the churches and the spirit of God would leave oh there would be great men that would rise under these Messengers and have the influence of the message in their life and they would shake the Earth but generally the leader of these of these systems they wouldn't want nothing to do with John Wesley no more a man named Spurgeon would rise but it wouldn't take many years till they wouldn't want nothing to do with Spurgeon foreign the world today wouldn't want nothing to do with William Branham they love what we saw last night but let me just say this to you when it came to the word they always excused themselves he went off of the word [Applause] because they're boards and their Association and their influence of Sodom they can't line up with the word because of the life that was preached here last night we live in a very unfit age but God has called for a bride that will come out of this that will be without spot or blemish [Applause] notice this would be the changing this would be the changing I no longer call you a church I call you bright this bride would be God's crowning achievement in this day this bride would be given checkbook Authority not in heaven but now it would be given life and to be given life we would be a people that are called out people and if I can say this if I can say this to where you understand it we needed the king of our heart that original King to die we needed that original life to die we needed a new purse and the new king the new Administration move in to our lives and we're no longer under that old headship anymore well brother Ron this is how I feel doesn't matter how you feel this is how I think it doesn't matter how you think all right we serve a different order it's not going to be socially accepted we must come to our thoughts this is not it for everybody sometimes we think well we've got to make it listen don't try to polish the message up don't try to polish it up to make it politically correct don't try to introduce a bunch of psychology and intellectualism to try to polish up make believers I am determined to just preach the word and if you if you feed bride food we live in a state to where you're not supposed to date a bait you're not supposed to uh bait deer bait bear but we live in a different order we baked bride we don't have hot dog suppers we don't have open houses we don't have sing-alongs what we we preach bride message and they will come I think it's something about they built a baseball field somewhere in the middle of nowhere and they said they'll come you just preach bright material and they will come listen we have a hungry people they want to hear the word they want to hear it in passion I know I don't want to hear a bad letter [Applause] I don't want some easy belief here someone I want something under a new Administration a prophetic word to a prophetic people a special class no one bad worshiper pretend worship I want real passionate worship I won't worship that brings the presence of God down that's what I want and we can worship from our soul I'm not interested in pleasing everybody around me I want to please him [Applause] the ship is to please God [Music] I may not be able to sing my way out of a tin can it don't matter well he can't hear me amen it don't matter he's listening [Applause] [Music] we've been here 50 years this is our 50th anniversary year we're not on this hill to be the biggest church in this community that's not what our interest is to be honest with you that's not what our interest is our interest is in him not only that I want that in your personal life as a church we're under a new Administration I just was that brother Ray Ericksons and and he now has become senior pastor and brother Wayne is now pastor of that church and that is a new Administration and that new Administration he he may have different ways under a different anointing and he'll lead that church under what God's leading him to do different insights on certain things it won't change the building but God has a way of lifting it to another Realm are you with me as a way of lifting it to another Realm Brother Ray has been a phenomenal pasture but now brother Wayne God has raised him up and he'll he'll lift him on the hat listen and if it comes time there'll be another man rise up and if God's doing and it's not organization doing it it's bringing the sea to the identification of Bride and material we've been through that brother Homer the founder of our of this church did a phenomenal work and he saw he saw a certain thing of that he needed to there were certain things that he didn't understand and he would tell me certain things I don't know how to preach and so I prayed and I prayed he actually invited several other guys to come but God led us to be here we've been here 23 years now 24 years and and and I hope by God's grace God's allowed us to to climb a little higher [Music] and when cancer struck we we had a vote here well I wasn't here to give a vote too late and we had a vote here it made brother Andrew co-pastor with me no not two heads but brother Andrew has you can tell by his Me by his meetings Has Lifted and we've got a team because it's more than a man's Administration that's what I'm driving at it's not built by a man it's not instituted by a man [Applause] did that do away with brother Homer no that doesn't disregard him whatsoever did it do away with Brother Ray Erickson no as a matter of fact it lifts them God takes me by the way of the Grave it won't do away with me and the work that I have done here but it's a continuation why did you put that in when God took brother Branham this is where I was going when God took the prophet the message had already got delivered and the message is the new Administration she'll be a super Church a super race she'll be the final voice to the final age she's bone of his bones she's life of his life she's spirit she is him [Applause] this is Christ in bright form [Music] did I say that all right God brings a new order it brings a new order he establishes the message established us of what the godhead was it three it wasn't one like your finger established us the serpency and took us through the trail of the serpent all the way from the beginning all the way to the end then he began to lay out the Mysteries all right now let me just say even The Messengers before knew there were certain things that they couldn't touch I like a statement of Spurgeon Spurgeon was one of the first ones that would have sermons written down in in paper form before he would preach and and brother Shannon this is mind-boggling to me but they would copy a hundred thousand tablets of his sermon before he would preach on Sunday Spurgeon was quite a preacher he was Prince of preachers is what they said and they would distribute those fly Leafs all over London and all over the place still being distributed but he said something that was very interesting he said God put it in my heart to write sermons down but he said there will come a time that they'll catch a man's voice to where they can preserve his voice but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel and on your first sermon that you hear first couple paragraphs we've got a gadget and they were capturing brother branham's voice for many of those audiences it just passed over their head and brother Brandon will say over and over again don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it let me give you an idea I sat with brother Garber at breakfast I wanted to meet him because he had significance to this area how many met brother Garber yeah he had significance to this area and he was the last one in the prayer line and deep calleth of the deep I met him at LNS him he's ever been there actually brother Branham ate there so that'd be interesting for you to know well anyway I met him there for breakfast he wasn't really interested too much in really talking to me he seemed he was an older man he was busy with his with his day and I I wanted to ask him about I want to ask him about what he experienced there and then what the Revival was like because I know that brother Brown prayed for him and pronounced a Revival there had to be a Revival and so I asked him about meeting him brother Branham and I asked him I asked him about the angel and he and he said these words to him he said I saw the angel he said a lot of us saw the angel he said he stood behind brother Branham or moved throughout the audience Pillar of Fire would move through the audience he was known as the man with the angel and I asked him I said was there any others on the scene because I knew was there any others on the scene that had an angel he said no of course not there wasn't nobody else with an angel brother Branham met the angel and that angel accompanied on the pulpit I said what did he look like he said it looked a bit like brother Branham and so I said what did you feel he said I've never felt God like I felt on that stage I said well well what happened he said well I came home and he said we had two weeks of the greatest Revival he said I think this area has ever had he didn't know about this church and he said I think we had two weeks of the greatest Revival that's ever had brother Charles I think your dad knew him well so anyway he he said he said we had a phenomenal Revival he said people parked five miles away and walked into the church he said two weeks and it was gone he said it just evaporated kind of shook his head he said it never came back and he just kind of didn't want to talk no more well I have the answer I have the answer if you don't welcome the word he comes by invitation he comes by invitation now you see he went to Simon's house by invitation but they didn't welcome him but he came because a girl was coming there and she was now going to live under a new Administration she came in one way and she left out a different way [Applause] Hallelujah and if you allow him in your life and he becomes the king of your heart you may come one way and you may be determined to stay that way but if that old man dies if the old man dies you can't have the old man and the new man at the same time I thought you said a phenomenal thing last night don't I don't particularly know why you said it but you said you can't talk and when you're married you can't talk about your Old Flames now I'm gonna I want to tell you why once you're married the marriage is a holy matrimony and to reintroduce oh lost brings a prostitute Spirit male and female back into your relationship and you're always competing with a shadow don't bring it keep your bed holy keep it holy but brother on I had all these relationships that old man's supposed to be dead now I'm doing something with that now you're married a new Administration has took place it's not your daddy's the head anymore now the husband is the head he's not to be abusive to hold that headship he's to be a leader in the home and you're his Queen and you pay him due respect you be honoring you It's A Love Affair between a man and a wife now I'm going higher than that when you come to God don't bring up old lovers [Applause] that's buried it's over with don't go back and get old music don't go back and get old things don't go back and watch those old nasty stuff don't bring it into the bedroom of your home it's a clean linen it's a pure lemonade [Applause] I would never do anything to disappoint Blondie and I mean that was on my heart I've asked God to take me home before I would disappoint him and I mean that with all my heart I Fellowship in a realm Two Worlds and I say it very reverently I'm not brother Branham but I'm thankful that I get to fellowship with angels thankful that I get to hear the voice of God I don't want to do anything to break that kind of Fellowship do you understand another thing brother Brandon said three things that would get a preacher money women and popularity let me just talk about those for a minute because they're going to get everybody money if you own the whole world and you lose your soul what profits you I was with I was the other day being taken care of by a nurse and she told me she was making a hundred and seventy two dollars an hour and I asked her was she happy and she said no I can't say I'm happy money does not bring happiness you can own the biggest farm in this community and it will not bring you happiness you can drive a Bentley some of us don't even know what that is you can drive a Bentley and crash at the next red light and somebody else can walk into your life man or female that make you feel like you're the king of the Earth but if it's adultery look where it's going to take you let me just say this stop and think about your grandkids stop and think about your children stop and think about your church man five minutes if we exaggerate it five minutes if we exaggerate it it's not worth losing eternity so the old Administration is a destroyer I've just described that to you and that's about the only way that I can put it for you and that's not just for preachers I'm sorry I'm so weak brother random said he should be the Principal if that's what we he is and we believe it don't we then if he is that then he should be the Principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks he should be the Principal theme of our life and if he's the principal theme of the Bible and the Bible is in US then he should be the Principal theme of everything that we do say think should be Christ I watched Andrew walk last night like Enoch walked and there came a time that he walked so close to God until God took him let me just give you a News Bulletin God's going to have a life that's going to walk so close to him until a righteous God can tell the devil you don't have a right to her [Music] she is without spot or blemish and I have a right because I bought her she can come home to me Hallelujah cleared her dead there's nothing that's held against her I find no fault [Applause] that's part one and neither can Satan [Applause] well brother Ron I'm I don't know so much about all this stick around stick around Noah's message was absolutely right and if you stuck around long enough when the water got about right there you were a believer and if you didn't think Jesus was right when the Earth was shaken and the sun refused to shine and everything was tiring apart they were screaming is this the Son of God too late Russia is doing exactly what she's supposed to do she ain't done yet as a matter of fact she's as warming her machine up North Korea is doing what she's going to do China a manned Army that no man can number not even China mother on I feel so restricted I feel we're so restricted in the walls of the message can I talk to you about walls for a couple of minutes our previous president started building a wall what a bunch of nonsense everybody started to throw fits over building a wall you know uh I'm not pro economy Republican or Democrat but there's reasons you've got to have laws my brother Ron I don't know about that I got no trespassing signs at my yard I don't want every Tom Dick and Harry putting a tent in my yard Building A Fire hunting my deer don't have none but hunting my dear I do have a few bear hunting my bear and while I'm sitting eating my dinner looking through it my listen I got a private house I don't want to keep it private so therefore I have Gates I have I have no trespassing signs I've got signs that says we shoot if you think mine's you ought to go to vijay's house tell him Jess tell him I brought him up men working railroad crossing no Railroad on that driveway explosive Danger he's probably talking about you jazz China built a wall 5500 miles long 5500 miles long it didn't preserve them from war they were trying to protect what they had somebody had a vision we're going to build a wall don't get your panties in a wad because our nation's trying to build a wall I am who I am foreign not changing for nobody only God [Applause] where did they get their inspiration from you're going to a save who has a wall all around the outside come on because you are the bride and I think there's where you're gonna live walls of Jasper streets of gold [Applause] Gates apparel we can't even explain how great those walls are going to be but all over the Earth the redeemed of the Earth people that's given eternal life because of their life is going to live all over but God's got a house for his bride sorry about Wows up [Music] one more thought in Matthew chapter 28 and verse 19. he said go you therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the Holy Ghost and maybe you don't understand this but Matthew wrote it exactly how Jesus said it now it was a wall it was a wall because so many people look in their Bible they're sincere they're very sincere and they read their Bible they bred it through over and over and over again but when it comes to Matthew chapter 28 and 19 they're walled off from the revelation and their eyes can't see past what happened that seraphent Matthew was standing there under that anointing and he walled it off and blinded their eyes that that's as far as they could see but when you came to it the Revelation Dropped In Your Heart he's talking about a name above every name a king above every King he's talking about Acts chapter 2 and verse 38 because the law protected from the holies of holy and the Revelation was Jesus Christ [Music] you couldn't miss it the walls wasn't for you I I feel like shouting right now the wall didn't keep you out the wall actually put you in [Applause] one more so when it comes to the Book of Revelations it is a book of Revelation it's exactly what it says so there's walls there so for the nominal Church when they look at the horse riders they got Christ riding that horse as pale red black and even white to start out with they got Jesus writing that but when the messenger under a new Administration looked at the book [Music] it wasn't Jesus riding those horses that was the arch enemy riding those horses and what that did is it opened the book that there were twins all the way since the garden even in heaven [Applause] and in every age God raised up a seed an anointed a seed that would overcome every horse rider [Applause] same enemy riding every horse but it's the same God anointing every Overcomer of their age [Music] and what your friends can't see you can't unsee foreign so good to have you back home I watched you walk on the stage and you're sung with the choir this morning you went good places but there's no place like home there's no place like home I heard you pray this morning brother Doug and I I heard the passion in your voice welcome home [Applause] I got a picture the other day of Jonathan and Autumn's baby looking out the window and she tells me how much she loves me how did Jonathan get here a new Administration no way your parents will you know we pray they see it but you just go why can't they say it but once you saw it you can't unsee it how did you get here you can't unsee that since it's Eternal as God is eternal I hope you've had some time with Stephen and Kara I mean they their life just maybe I'm where I'm weak I'm a little temperamental Chris you're supposed to be here all the time Mary you may be so much like Ruth Ann everybody tells me they must be kin there's so much alike well maybe some of her parents had something to do with your parents out there in Arkansas but we all come from a tree Gabrielle what are you doing here you're a Pruitt what are you doing here probably going to have more Pruitts before it's all over with we got too many girls and boys here for to not be more Pruitts here it'd be wonderful some things the things you wrestle with so hard it's because you're being birthed amen you remember when you were in the womb don't you sure you do you remember when you was in a womb use in there and everything was so comfortable you could hear Mama's breathing and you could hear her heartbeat and she was feeding you sometimes some really funny stuff pickles and peanut butter and it was going right down from here it was going right through an umbilical cord and it was hooked on the inside of you and and you were growing some of you were about the size of a peanut when you were born but some of it was 11 pounds but you guys must have been eating potatoes a whole lot foreign you're getting ready to have a baby now what you're going to have to do is push and Brandon your job is not go get a Coca-Cola and a Snickers bar at the wrong time I did that that don't work I'm standing at the machine and getting myself a uh I think I finally got a Pepsi out of there and my money just kept going in and they called me across the thing and get to the delivery room immediately I sat there all night I was hungry I was a lot of good for it all I'll just tell you I was a lot of good I ran in the room they throwed me in this deal and tied it around me put gloves on I saw what was going on passed out [Applause] thank you there's no we're having a baby here but only at least two of them I was going and Connie said why don't you push listen she held my hand so tight my size nine ring became before [Applause] but she had to push those beautiful boys and little girl from that Realm they didn't want to come and she pushed and she pushed because time was ready and she pushed I'm sorry Gabrielle sorry to bring up horror and she pushed thank God for epidurals for fathers and mothers and that baby came out screaming that's what you want to hear isn't that right in that right Anna that's what you want to hear now that baby yeah he looks like his daddy no I think he looks like his mama he looks like himself why would you end a sermon like this some of you when you first came in were so at home in this world you were so comfortable you so like what you was doing and you didn't realize the enemy was feeding you through the umbilical cord God had a plan he had planted a seed before you ever arrived on the inside of you and when you you came to serve the Lord stood at the altar and you held on I'm not going down there and then you find yourself here well I'll Never Shout and then you find yourself sweaty I'm not going to sit through an hour sermon you sit through a three-hour movie [Applause] but after a while you you've breathe life into this world and you said this isn't as hard as I thought it was going to be I don't even want to talk about

the fire last night to that tree and you see here a while back that tree got hit by lightning there was no storms last night so somebody had to set that tree on fire I don't care I like fires too so
