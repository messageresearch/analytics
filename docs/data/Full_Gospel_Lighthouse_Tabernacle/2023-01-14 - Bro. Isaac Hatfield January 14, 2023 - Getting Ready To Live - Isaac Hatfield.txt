for the opportunity we certainly appreciate our brother Andrew and our brother Ron giving us the opportunity of course brother Ron was there to ordain us back in Ohio so it means a lot to us and he's he's poured out a lot for our families in some very difficult times so thankful for the opportunity just to give a little bit back tonight and of course we bring greetings from Brother Wayne and brother Ray and the church back home and thankful to have my wife with me we're just very thankful and we just want to go to the word tonight if you could turn with us to Ezekiel 37. to be dismissed Ezekiel 37 and we want to read from verse 1. down through 14. amen it says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and Lowell they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered O Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Jai broke Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld low the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet and exceeding great Army then he said unto me son and man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost and we are cut off for our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God behold o my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come up out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves o my people and brought you up out of your Graves and he said and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and I shall place you in your own land then shall you know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it saith the Lord if we could bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your grace and our lives we thank you for another time just to gather in your presence father we believe it's in your presence that there's life father where things can change Lord and we just invite you Lord the life Giver just to come by our way and just now father may you go down the Avenues of your children's hearts and just speak father Lord where no man could ever know father may you just discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and may you just bring a satisfying portion to each and every heart tonight father that they'd go away full of your joy and your peace and your satisfying power father Lord we're on able in our own selves to do any of these things but we surrender this service into your hands father that you'd use it for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats amen we could take a title out of that it would be getting ready to live and why because God said so you know in perilous times brother Brown said our comfort is God said so it's not it's not the news it's not the things of the world it's God said so the word is our comfort and God cared enough for you to send you a comforter he cared enough for you that he said I go away but I shall not leave you comfortless and he said he sent the same care that he cared for the people when he was here on the earth when he healed their sick when he raised him from the dead he sent that same comforter back to you that you would have the same care that he gave when he was here walking on this Earth that same care that same comforter and what a Grace in our lives and it's becoming of us to stay with that word you see nature is getting ready to live you can look outside and it's a winter condition because some intelligence caused the sap in those trees to go down in The Roots if you put a bucket of water out there it wouldn't do the same thing but there's some intelligence that caused that to preserve that life to keep it there predestinated until the right season to bring it back up in the springtime of the Year and that same intelligence watches over you and has preserved you that same intelligence brought you to that meeting tonight to this meeting that same intelligence knows when you lay down your head and those mind battles you grow through that's the same intelligence that hung the stars in space and and took that sap and put it in those roots and brings it up again it's the same intelligence you know you might have come in a winter condition tonight in the winter condition of this world outside it's cold and you can get what something's called seasonal depression or seasonal affective disorders what Mayo Clinic calls that which stands for sad you're just sad it just it gets dark at six o'clock you wake up and you're freezing because it's so cold outside you're just sad but there's a reassurance that spring is coming but if you come in a winter condition spiritually tonight we can say spring isn't coming but spring is here it's more than the day of the year but your beneficiaries of his resurrection we can celebrate it each and every day as Christians because Easter he took our sins upon him and when he died we died with him and when he rose we rose with him and he gave us the satisfaction that our soul has already lifted above the cares of the world brother Brandon said all that Winter's coldness of cold formal religion killed out there the nearing of the Son of God in these last days coming to the church restores it back to life again and he said the only way it can ever remain dead is let it lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life again so God let us fall in the right channel that's right for a restoration we can fall in a Channel of restoration tonight where a law of God says winter has to give up its grip to the that when the spring Sun Comes The Law of God's word says that sun has to cause winter to give up its grip it has to release and let way for that spring sun to bring life again to bring restoration restoration and that sun forces that life out of that seed when you put your life under this message if there's a gene seed in there that son will force the life out of that seed it'll make the real you come forth show you who you really are show you who you always have been in the mind of God that's what God's law says and it will only Force the life out of that seed it didn't come to raise life out of the dirt or out of that rock but somewhere in that dirt they're surrounding a Gene's seed and that's what that son came to bring forth life out of this message isn't for everyone but it's for you the bride the believer because there was a seed in the little humble piece of dirt somewhere that the law of God said when that Sun Passes over it it will revive again it will resurrect again the law of God he sent it with his word to see it through he sent his law with his word to see it through a law life to see that that word would come to pass oh the world is getting ready to live they say we're just getting ready to live nothing like that could happen now nothing of that destruction could happen now we're just getting ready to live like brother Branham saw those two girls going through that hotel saying whoopee this is life he said no you're wrong it's death and brother Brandon came back and said there must be two conceptions of what life is because David said thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee he said what could possibly be better than life but then he read she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she yet liveth and he said there must be two conceptions of what life really is and they begin to come up with slogans like where there's Budweiser there's life or life begins with the sun goes down and they got a little bit more religious and said if you join a church you'll have life but there's still two conceptions brother Brandon one time went to a Service Company dance uh an award ceremony and he went to this thing and they went through all the ceremonies and then they come to the end they said well Billy you might want to walk outside because we're about to have this dance and he said all right well okay and he begins to head to the door and this girl begins to come through and start picking each man and dancing with him and she grabs Billy and she said brother Branham says do you want to dance he said why sure he said but before I do anything I always like to pray and he knelt her down and started a prayer meeting there at that dance floor and broke that up because he said there's two conceptions of what life is he said one ass suicide and the other has Rapture there is a life but there is a reality that you can find that'll break every every religious spirit every spirit of fear and every Spirit of depression on your life there is a true satisfaction and you don't have to settle for a false conception when the skies are full of the Pentecostal blessing that you can receive and experience with a true life Giver that'll change your nature it'll change your path that you're walking through it'll bring that see it and burst forth a life of a Son of God or a daughter of God and let you know that that's the real you it was laying in there all the time and Winter's coldness cannot stop it from coming forth it'll force that death to give up its grip oh but there's some Believers he said you love them this is where I drew my text from you want to see him coming you're waiting for him it's a long story or a long wait it's a love affair but you just can't wait till you see him oh my that's the way it is that's the time we're looking for that's the hour if your heart's not like that tonight be careful see be careful don't let the enemy deceive you when the Holy Spirit in here wants to take its flight to its maker to its Master There's A Love Affair that no one can tell about it's real so if there's a warning saying you're not ready for that God might be getting ready you ready for something see you're not ready you say well if I get baptized the Holy Ghost then well maybe the Lord will take me and he said not only that you're just then getting ready to live you ain't ready to live till you get the Holy Ghost and then when you get the Holy Ghost you're just fit to live you wasn't fit to live before that see but now you're just fit to live after you get the holy you ghosts just getting you ready he said people say I got to get ready to die brother Brown said oh my I'm getting getting ready to live amen the thing of it is get ready to live live in Christ's Victorious Life over sin death and hell I already have the victory he's my victory and I'm his evidence and I'm the evidence of his victory amen he said what are you living for he said so you can die every one of you what are you working for to eat what are you eating for to live what are you living for to die so he said why not live to live why not live to live and he says the only way you can live is to accept the word and when you accept that word it'll bring a life into your life you're not just receiving a temporal Joy but you're receiving your Escape that whosoever believeth on him shall not perish but has already passed from Death on the life and life cannot exist together with death and when you've received that life it's past Beyond tribulation it's passed Beyond judgment because it will no longer magnetize with sin because in you is life and brother bran says life connects with life and you used to connect with the world and you used to connect with sin but it'll no longer connect anymore because you passed into something greater in that life now the very same in the same thing that was in you to allow you to receive this message is the very same thing that won't allow you to go through the tribulation because life connects with life and death connects with death and you passed into a realm where your soul is above judgment your soul is above sin you're living in another realm you're living no longer to die but you're getting ready to live an immortal life with Jesus Christ you passed into something greater oh greater than you could ever imagine with your temporal mind your soul is already in the Heavenly places with almighty God oh it can exist together blessed is the man to whom God will not appute sin and brother Braham said he cannot impute sin over that token he doesn't even see you the way you see yourself he sees you the way he saw you before the foundation of the world when he accepted you with Christ and spoke your name with his and put it on the Lamb's Book of Life well that's the way he sees you he cannot even impute sin onto you little bride you passed into something different oh what a Grace see how they took that Perfect Tree brother Branham said was Jesus Christ that perfect tree and it that it might be fulfilled in his life you think you're going through life by accident just look at the life of Jesus Christ his birth was fulfilling prophecy and there Mary and Joseph were there and they were having visions and dreams of this baby coming and all along it was fulfilling prophecy of those little things their day-to-day life was fulfilling something when he was called out of Egypt it was fulfilling prophecy when he was called in Nazarene it was fulfilling prophecy when he took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses it was fulfilling prophecy when he spoke in Parables it was fulfilling prophecy and one day he rode into a village and said You shall find and ask tied into court with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you you shall say the Lord hath needed them and straightway he shall send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of Zion thy King behold he cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass in the cult the full of the ass and brother Brown said critics came by and said that someone went ahead and tied that thing up before they ever got there he said critics can't understand the pre-arrangement of God they can't understand the supernatural so they come up with some some bizarre explanation he said that no wonder a little boy could feed five thousand he said the loaves were bigger in that day oh but he said brother Brandon just said I'll have you to know a little boy carried him in his lunch but that's the critic's mindset it'd be easier to accept that a little boy could carry some giant loaf than just to accept the pre-arrangement of almighty God but his brother and said God gives room for critics he said you didn't quite catch that that didn't sink in just good I'll tell you again God gives room for criticism but the word goes on he allowed a room because there's a Critic and it's becoming of that critic to fulfill his part of the word but it's becoming a me to fulfill my part of the word to fulfill my part as a Believer to fulfill my part as a Son of God it's not becoming a me to be a Critic they can't even understand the pre-arrangement of almighty God how God could do something like that oh when they cast lots on his Vester it was fulfilling prophecy how hard that must have been for him to sit there and watch that going on they rejected their sacrifice they rejected the Son of God it wasn't easy when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane and said not my will but thine be done but God never said this walk would be easy but it's becoming of you to fulfill our righteousness it was becoming of Noah to stand in the hour of trial it was becoming of Enoch to forsake his family and take a stroll and fulfill your type it was becoming of Daniel not to bow down to the image or worship any other gods it was becoming of the Hebrew children to take their stand for God none of this was easy friends but it was becoming of Abraham to separate from unbelief and it's becoming of you to stand by the word and not be ashamed of your religion to not be ashamed to take your stand with the Lord's despised you brother Brandon said I don't believe in a lot of nonsense or Tommy rot but I believe in the gospel preached in the power of demonstration for he said it's that what saved me that's what kept Him the hour of trial that's what kept him in the hospital when he was sick and about to die that's what kept her he said that's what's going to get him to the other side if he ever makes it because that's what's always been there he wasn't ashamed of that gospel oh you see brother Brandon preached that message it'd becometh you to fulfill all righteousness he preached it while his mother was laying on her deathbed and they said the devil's been trying to get me out of this Pulpit all evening oh you see how the devil will try to get you out of your position because it's not easy when you have to get your children together and come to church it'd be easier for you to stay home but he's trying to get you out of your position but God never said it would be easy but he said it's becoming of you to fulfill all righteousness it's becoming of you depressed beyond that he's been trying to get your pastor out of the pulpit with stage four cancer but there's something in him that says it's becoming a me to keep the message and move forward it's becoming to me to fulfill my part of the word what's been spoken over my life it's becoming a me though it's not easy though it's sometimes hard and I have to press through different difficulties to get there it's becoming a me to stay with that word to stay with that message to not be ashamed of My Religion oh but don't worry friends or think that God doesn't see you he came back that night and preached the comforter and he said mother doesn't even know it but God kept her alive while I was preaching God sees what you forsaken to be here tonight God sees what you've forsaken to stand for this message brother bran said who would pay a thousand fold everything you forsake for almighty God he pays you back in Bountiful blessings it's not easy but there's a comforter watching over you he'll prepay everything you forsake when you forsake the world friends young people you forsake the world God will repay you a thousandfold everything you forsake for this message it's becoming of you to forsake all and stand for this message give your all to it oh I never said it would be easy but it's becoming of you you're the bride you're fulfilling your portion of the scripture like Jesus did when he was walking on this Earth and it's becoming of you he cares you he cared enough to send you this message he cared enough to send you a comforter oh he's watching over you friends what a comforter that we have oh it's becoming oh they said he was washed up they hung that Perfect Tree on a Roman Tree and said he's washed up because all men forsake Him how is it possible to see him in the state he didn't lose his ministry he was fulfilling it brother Brandon said Easter was his crowning he wasn't washed up he was fulfilling his ministry though rejected and brother Brown said I was a great guy when I come among you just Healing The Sick speaking of visions and showing things but when I went to tell you the truth about the word what did you turn your back on me for do you realize it's just fulfilling what the scripture said but there was one thing almighty God Stood Beside him in the midst of it all and he said I pray I wish that God I hope that whole Crown my Ministry of letting me take the clothes of the word and dress his bride in the clothes of the word and let me stand on that day and say Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and before he left this Earth he saw a vision of a bride passing in preview and she was clothed in the word she wasn't closed in the scanty garments of the world that she was closed in the word and when that first charts passed before her brother Brandon saw and she said my heart was happy it was the crowning of his ministry when he introduced us to Jesus Christ and said my Ministries to declare him he is here he was rejected in that third pole Ministry but it was the crowning of his ministry delivering it to us a message clothing Us in the clothes of his word and this bride has a humble Ministry it's not a public show but they say you're washed up because you left the Pentecostal church or you left the Baptist Church and now you're preaching the message and now you're preaching adoption and now you're preaching the power of God they say you're washed up but you're not washed up you're prospering we're not getting ready to build kingdoms on this Earth We're representing the master we're here to represent Jesus Christ you have ministry here that could put every televangelist a shame but we have a promise to meek shall inherit the earth we're not here to build kingdoms we're here to represent the master oh we've got a greater desire we're getting ready to live and he's said I will God who Crown your life you might be a housewife but a whole Crown your life with the glory of this word and the second coming to take you away oh it's been spoken over you that you shall prosper David said it in Psalms 1 he'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his leaves shall not wither whatsoever he do is shall prosper you may think you're withering when you come to church and your car breaks down and you don't even have money to pay the rent but look a little deeper it's already been spoken over you and Shout out with her but it shall prosper you're a part of God's tree God sent you to this earth he said his word will not return void but he sent you here to fulfill what he called you to do when he sent Jesus here he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world they said he was washed up but he was prospering in the word God sent him to do when you've lost loved ones and you say how could I possibly be prospering but God's watching over you your Comforts are just beyond the river and we have a promise that he'll never leave us nor forsake us so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me and I'd rather have that than all the prosperity of the world I'd rather have that than all the money of the world to know that the Lord's on my side that the Lord's my helper that he's already promised that we're going to make it oh they took that perfect tree and they killed it but brother man said they could only kill it down the roots because there was some predestinated fruit in that roots and I believe I was there that's why the devil could only take you so far because you were a gene seed An Almighty God you were a predestinated fruit down in The Roots so they took him down to hell but in hell he was conquering death Hell In The Grave for you and me that's why he would keep that car accident from taking place because the devil could only go so far but there was some predestinated seed in your life to lift you up through every trial brother Gabriel he could take you so far but he couldn't take you past that point where God said there's a predestinated seat in his life and you must stop here Satan because I'm going to bring it forth and a son of God because you have roots and more than the Spencer family you have roots in glory god knew you before the foundation of the world brother Brahm said if he didn't know me he's not even God because God the foreknowledge the omnipotence of almighty God knew you before the foundation of the world oh we prophesied of his resurrection he said you destroy this Temple I'll bring it back again in three days because he was getting ready to die he was ready to die but he was getting ready to live brother bran said where'd that confidence come from because he knew what was written about him in the word and the same word that spoke about him says we are already raised in him it said that he'd raise us up and we're already raised with him and where does your confidence come from because what the word spoke about you that he which began the work in your life we'll see it through your confidence comes and what he's spoken over you like that little eagle with those wings he wasn't afraid of the Prophet because he had confidence in the wings on his back that would take him through in the midst of trial no matter what came his way brother Brown said about that Finland boy he said his resurrection was pre-arranged two years before it ever happened and he said that same he said you're a resurrectionist pre-arranged also he said some glorious day he'll come it's all pre-arranged when brother Branham saw you be on the curtain of time he said what did that he said it's quickening power in the same quickening power that would let him see me beyond the curtain that same quickening power will see to it that I get there to fulfill that Vision it's quickening power I may be ready to die but I'm getting ready to live because the word spoken Resurrection over our lives the word spoken Joy over our lives I'm already spoken for brother Branham said no wonder he said fear not oh no wonder he said fear not because he's already been there he's already walked that dark path of the grave and he's already seen how that promise of Resurrection works so he says no wonder he said fear not he's been there oh he's been there he would know because you planted your life in something with influence we have a sure word and brother bran said he planted that tree on the day of Pentecost he planted it and he divided his life he divided his life for you and for me he divided his life brother and said that's the message we must get to the people how God divided his life that's still the message we must get to the people that God must divide his life you must be born again he'll put in you a life to carry you through oh what a Grace but there came in some messengers of death that came in a palm where I'm distill your joy distill the fruits off the tree distill your peace he come to steal the joy because Brothers had a dignified group came amongst the common people and they said this revival is good but you're going to have to stop all that shouting if you want us to come among your group we want to join but you're going to have to get rid of all of that because It embarrasses us you people make too much noise they eat away the joy of your salvation till the presence of the Lord has departed from them the cares of the world has dried up their experience to the cares of your job you can't even come to church and praise the Lord because the cares of your job has dried up your joy it's dried up that channel to where you'd you can't even Worship the Lord when you're driving down the car it's just mind battles it's just confusion Satan's try to clog up that channel but brother Brown said the spirit of God ought to be Joy he said people that don't believe in shouting haven't got enough spiritual Joy something got in there and clogged up that channel until they couldn't rejoice in the Lord some teacher came by and said it was a bunch of emotion and clogged up a channel till they couldn't have any spiritual Joy oh but there's a restoration for your joy you can come to the house of the Lord and find Freedom I've had more joy believe in this message than I ever did and all the things of the world than I ever did at any basketball game or any football game though I may have enjoyed them this message has been a Greater Joy to me than everything there's been a restoration happened in my life that's given me a joy that passes all understanding it's a joy in the midst of the world falling apart it's a victory it's the rejoy the Restoration in our midst oh he can do it for you let this message be Amen to you when you come to church and pastors preaching to say amen Amen to that word amen to that word and you'll start forgetting about the things of your day and the things of your job and all of a sudden that withered Leaf will start to become a lovely Leaf in the presence of God Joy will begin to flow into your life that devil has tried to steal that from you he's a robber but there's a restoration you can receive and get under this message and let it be Amen to you it'll open up that channel Hallelujah you may have come in the seat of the scornful oh but you can plant yourself in a different place and he'll give you Beauty for Ashes he'll give you the oil of joy for mourning in the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness he'll try to come and eat away your peace and to know that you're saved to know that you're going to make it and he'll try to replace it with reciting or joining brother bran said there's no joy in that but he said thanks God that's not thank the Lord that's not God's tree that's not God's provided way but we know who we are we know who we came from what's your identity it's not Methodist it's not Baptist but your identity is born again that's why you can't hybrid that's why you can't fall because there's something in your identity that shows you where you came from and shows you where you're going like Paul on the ocean that day said fear not friends be of good cheer for the angel has come and spoke to me and said you must be peer before Caesar and all those that are in the ship with you are going so to fear not and be of good cheer I don't know what's going to happen between here and the other land but I know that the ship's going to make it to the other side be of good cheer friends you're on the ship brother Branham said it's going to the other side he said it's not going to wreck up till it reaches the shore of Glory you can let off the pressure in the presence of God there's a City of Refuge you can enter into and there's a peace that passeth all understanding brother Brandon said cast your cares upon Him for he cares for you is written on every door in that City you can come in there and stake down a stake and say I'm an eagle I'm in his Refuge zone I'm gonna make it I've already made it in Christ because he made it for me oh you've already made it in him you can let off that pressure there's a cycle breaker that can break that spirit of fear that try to torment you young people that comforter is a cycle breaker I've been their cycle after cycle but I'm a witness that there is a comforter in the building that can break that cycle and restore to you your peace restore to you your joy and let you know that you've made it in Christ that you're his son that you're already his you may have to press through battles but there's a piece that can be installed in your life and let you know who you are and let you know where you came from and let you know what your identity is you may be battling identity complex but there's a piece in the building to settle that for your life you are an invincible Army you've already made it in him you're a threat to Satan's kingdom you're anointed to be a serpent Bruiser you were created to serve the Lord oh brother Ron spoke those words to me in a prayer line one time and I held those in many a dark night in my bedroom alone in the midst of great fears I said I'm a threat to Satan's kingdom I'm anointed to be a serpent loser I'm created to serve the Lord when I didn't even know if I believed it you stay with that word and you're a threat you're anointed you're going to make it there's peace in this city of Refuge where you can let off the pressure you can enjoy your religion God's called you you're his child let off the pressure tonight and just rejoice in who you you are and your identity as a Son of God that he's called you those mind battles it's a lie he's nothing but a bluff if you come into that City you can drive down a stake and just accept who you are except that you've already made it if you made that calling an election sure you don't have to go back and keep checking it he's kicked the door shut and you're in him and he's in you and you're his bride and you're already sitting in Heavenly places he's the peace Giver young person Surrender Your Life to him he's called you you can find that Joy you can find that satisfaction in that experience of almighty God the baptism of the Holy Ghost it'll change you it'll make you different Brethren said oh the baptism that fell on the day of Pentecost they don't make you different you say well I'm still the same then you didn't receive what fell on Pentecost you say I don't believe in speaking of tongues and Divine Healing he said then you didn't receive the baptism that fell on the day of Pentecost it'll make you different it'll change you it'll give you a reality that that Palmer has come in and try to steal and kill and destroy oh there's a reality in the peace of God for you my friends there's a reality you have everything for life's journey even the Rapture in you when you receive the Holy Ghost oh you may have to go through some trials you may have to fight for every inch but in your soul there's a satisfaction in the peace oh but then that Locus come in and try to steal Divine Fellowship away or that place where you can relax in the presence of God and cool off brother bran said predestinate his son sit in Heavenly places that coolness and comfort of feeling at home that place where you can let off the pressure in the presence of God and get into an atmosphere where you can fellowship with the Lord and you can fellowship with your brother we have something in common friends that's not the state we live in it's not what I wear but this this power will let us we'll let a Calico dress hug a satin dress and said we're brothers and we're sisters this power will break off that little weird feelings you can bury those differences with the old year that wither Leaf try to come in and take away your joy but we have something in common friends it's this message he said if I be lifted up we may not talk the same we might not dress the same but in the presence of God we have something in common Jesus Christ has saved us we believe this message we're going in a Rapture we're going in a resurrection to together friends we believe this same message and we've come to lift up Jesus Christ and declare him as the King of Kings and the Lord of lords all those little odd feelings you might be a good person that just got planted in the wrong place you got planted in an offense or a complex somewhere and that Devil's tried to steal away your joy and say well so and so offended me you know try to get you away from that flock of deer that's just where the devil wants you to destroy your life but stay under the protection of Fellowship stay under those Cool Waters where you can fellowship with the Lord you can fellowship with your brother and sister oh hell he'll try to steal that Fellowship from you from you young people oh but we love you we're here for you pastors here for you your brother's here for you you don't have to get that complex that no one loves you stay under that coolness and then you don't just have to go to church to get under an atmosphere you'll carry it with you everywhere you go you'll be a place where others can cool off underneath you talk about the Lord Fellowship about what he's done for you oh it's a Grace that third bug was a canker worm and he come for that bark and the bark was the covering you see he didn't say the leaves were the covering religion was never meant to be a covering for you but what this what this devil does is he tries to come in and trade a natural for a spiritual like that first church Israel they said oh my there Samuel was leading them under the power of the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire was leading them they were winning every battle they were winning every war under the leadership of the Holy Ghost but they got to looking out at the Philistines Army where a natural King was leading them and they said my wouldn't it be nice to have a king like them wouldn't it be nice to have a king like them they said we appreciate the Miracles and the wisdom and the provision and protection we believe it it said we like it and furthermore we don't want to be without it it's just that we want a king to lead us into battle they said it's still Our intention to have the priests go ahead with Judo following and we'll blow the trumpets and shout and sing We don't intend to stop any of that we want we want a king who is one of us to lead us they said oh we'll still quote the prophet we'll still go and sit in the message church we want all of that in fact we appreciate it but we want a natural leadership instead of the leadership of the pillar of fire and they rejected natural leadership for the leadership of the Holy Ghost and brother the Bible it says little did they realize that when they were asking God to let them be like the rest of the world they were rejecting him though they kept all their Creeds though they kept all their Church going though they got up in church and sang they said we want all of it what we don't want the leadership of the Holy Ghost and when you reject the power of God you've rejected the very thing that made you different from the rest of the world but it's not becoming of you to look the same as the world it's becoming of you to not be ashamed of this message it's becoming of you to stand with this word not to reject this power of God not to reject the moving of the Holy Spirit to come into the church and speak to your hearts and minister to you and perform the miraculous oh they rejected the very thing that made them different and when you say we don't need the Holy Spirit to heal the sick or we got doctors we don't know the Holy Spirit to speak when tongues we're all intelligent people he said when you do that you take right from your framework the lifeline the lifeline of the church oh how come and try to give you a false satisfaction in place of a true but that's the devil trying to rob you of that true joy and that true peace you see this tactic of Satan would be distilled your joy to steal your fellowship but he's going for that life he may start small but he's going for that life he's trying to get to that tree and still the life from me he tried to come in and suck out the very life to denominate a move of God that Satan's tactic to come in and take that away from you but God is determined that that wouldn't happen to you because he called you he called you to be his bride oh Satan would try to steal that life from you but God is determined that this Vine won't die he said what about those things that went off in denomination but the Bible says the husbandman watches over the tree he comes by and he trims It Off when something becomes some some someone come into the nominated Luther's message to come by and just trimmed it off he come by and just trimmed it off but brother Brown said the main part of the thing kept growing justification grew into sanctification which grew into the Holy Ghost which grew into the word itself but God he said God never touched that vine when he trimmed off those denominational branches he never touched that vine he never touched true justification he never touched true sanctification he never touched the true baptism of the Holy Ghost he never touched the true message he only trimmed off the denominational things and so when they come in some of them bring their chainsaws and they try to trim off legalism and they accidentally hit right into true sanctification they try to trim off fanaticism and they hit into a true experience but when God gave you this message it was already trimmed formalism was already trimmed off of this message fanaticism was already trimmed over the smell for this message oh put your chainsaws away and just preach the message just believe the message it's already trimmed for you you don't have to worry about fanaticism God's watching over his heritage Edge he's watching over you he's already trimmed it off but he never touched that reality and they would come in and try to deny the Church of the vine they tried to deny you of a true experience they tried to deny you of true sanctification and he said who would deny me of my Vine but I say like Elijah if God cares to send the crows with some meal I don't know where it comes from but I'm just going to eat it he said that's the same way with the Holy Ghost when God sends over just a sweep of Joy brother and said I don't know where it comes from all I know is God sent it and I enjoy it and if he cared enough to send it I care enough to receive it if he cared enough to send us this message I care enough to receive it if he cares enough to send a sweep of a Spirit of Dance through this building I care enough to receive it he's looking for somebody that's going to care enough to receive what he sends if he cares to send you a restoration of Joy tonight why don't you care to receive what he sends you why don't you care to receive when he's sends you your peace why do you care when he sends if he cares to send me a Rapture I care enough to receive it if he cares enough to send us our prodigals home I care enough to receive it God knew your characters no accident you received this message he knew there was something you need to receive it that's why he sent it to you you're his bride you cared for him you cared enough to ask for Joy you cared enough to ask for a Revival and God said if they care to ask for it I'll care to send it and they'll care to receive it Go receive it with a joy they'll receive it because they love me and they're my bride it's no accident you're here in Virginia it's no accident you're at Full Gospel Lighthouse God knew the desires of your heart and he had you in the right place at the right time to receive this message like the woman at the well it was the same intelligence that puts that sap into the roots brought you here to receive this message because he knew you would care to receive it he knew you would care to pick it up and say I'm going on a run despite the difficulties despite the hardships I'm gonna run with this message he knew your heart and he had you standing there to receive it he had you standing there to receive your prayer to be answered oh because you cared enough he cares for those that care he cares for those that care enough to ask for it he cares for those that care enough to receive it when he sends it to receive it when he sends your Victory oh we don't know where it comes from when the power of God falls into the building and baptizes our hearts but all we know is God sent it and we're going to receive it because it come from God and I care enough to receive it I care enough to receive my Revival I care enough to receive my message because God sent it oh Elijah he cares for you you're his beloved he's called you to this day he's called you for this moment oh care enough to receive it when he sends it oh they will try to deny to you oh you say you're getting out on a limb but it's the limb of the restored bride tree where the evening lights are shining I stepped off the Lamb of man's idea and got onto a limb where all things are possible I got onto a limb where the power of God satisfies my hungry soul oh we got enough preaching Palmer worms in church going canker worms we need some messengers of life to preach this message to preach like Luther preached his message like Wesley preached his message like they preached on the uh on the restoration of gifts we need some messengers of life to preach true joy to preach true peace to preach true experiences to preach true restoration until every heart is full of the Holy Ghost to messengers of Life that'll say I don't care what they say oh I'm Gonna Stand because it's becoming me to stand oh and nothing can stop this one nothing can stop this bride he said this time because the word is predestinated nothing is going to stop it said all the bugs of hell can turn loose on her and it will never stop her oh you weren't just the predestinated fruit in The Roots anymore you're the living fruits of his presence his son has passed over you and quickened you oh you're living in his presence you say well late frost hurt the crop what if a late Frost comes what if it's too late for our prodigals to come home but Martha one day brother Brandon said Lazarus he said Lazarus and Jesus were friends he said they would play together he said Mary and Martha and said they would build tapestries together for the temple and one day Lazarus come and said there's a mighty Prophet standing down on Jordan he speaks of one greater than he's becoming who will baptize with the Holy Ghost and Fire you ought to go down and see him he said you don't know who's sitting next to you you don't know who's sitting next to you you don't know when you go out into town who you're talking with it may be a very member of the Bride of Jesus Christ it was just one baptizing down by Jordan telling about a man but you don't know who's sitting next to you tonight you don't know the power that's in that life you don't know who you're bumping into day to day it may be Angels you don't know who's sitting next to you but they said Jesus ministry took him away from home immediately trouble set in and Lazarus took sick and Jesus wouldn't come and they said Jesus note all things the father had showed them he said brother man said I believe he's seen the resurrection of Lazarus he said our friend Lazarus sleepeth and they thought he did well but he said no he's dead and for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there he said I believe he's seen the resurrection of Lazarus when all hopes were gone The Miracle Worker had let them down and Martha was there and that the first day there was nothing at the second day there was nothing but all of a sudden a rumor came that The Miracle Worker was coming into their midst all of a sudden a rumor came Jesus is coming back into town Jesus is coming back into town but Martha didn't just let that stay a rumor Martha remembered the story of the shunamite woman how God and the Prophet Elijah had come down and there was a woman with a dead baby and that baby came to life through God and Elijah because that shoonamite woman recognized that it was more than Elijah in her midst but it was almighty God and Martha's sitting here remembering that and she's thinking surely if God was with his Prophet Elijah surely he's with his son says surely he's with this word that's coming into the town surely he's with his son she wasn't worried about the outward appearance she wasn't worried about who it was coming through she wasn't worried about if it was coming through Andrew Spencer or Ron Spencer or brother William she said surely if God was with his Prophet surely he's with his son and Martha recognized the potential of what was coming into her midst she recognized the potential that the same God was in or missed it wasn't just a rumor to Martha but she said he's in our midst he's here right now to do the impossible Martha recognized the potential of what was coming into town she recognized the potential of the word oh he said maybe brother branham's gone but she didn't pray for Elijah to return she recognized the potential of what was in her midst you see brother bran said when Elijah left he made preparations that the spirit of God might remain on the earth in Elisha oh he made preparations that the spirit of God might remain in a bride we're not looking for brother Branham to return to give us this great Revival I have news for the devil what they're looking for to return it never left but it's here with a bride body can you recognize the potential of what's in your midst like the woman with the blood issue recognize the potential though 12 years with this Affliction she recognized the potential of what was coming into her midst can you recognize the potential like blind Bartimaeus that sold his lamb because something was coming to his midst that could change everything that could change every horror can you recognize like Mariah Pruitt when she stepped into a prayer line and said there's something in my midst oh it's not just a history lesson but there's something here that can change all things can you recognize what's in your midst can you recognize the potential oh when television was there they would have called him mentally upset as something vibrating through the air could perform a picture because somebody believed there was an airwave God had it there in one bright day they broke into that realm and picked it up and it produced a picture Thomas Edison thought there was a rumor that electricity was possible there was a rumor that electricity could carry over a wire and make light and it didn't give up on the first wire but he searched every wire he searched night and day while he ate a sandwich while he drank his coffee he was searching for the potential that that rumor held that all things were possible that light could come forth oh are you hearing me friends he recognized that there was a potential in his midst that there could come light oh I'm coming down to close but listen to this there's a Wright brothers one time who thought flight is possible and Wilbur Wright wrote this letter he said for some years I have been Afflicted with the belief that flight is possible to man my disease has increased in severity I feel it will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life I've been trying to arrange my Affairs in such a way that I can vote my entire life to a few months of experiment in this field but friends he had typhoid fever but his disease his disease was not his affliction his Affliction was that flight was possible oh your disease might be that your prodigals are gone your disease might be that you're sick in your body your disease might be that you have stage four cancer but your Affliction is that you've recognized the potential of what's coming your midst oh Ron Spencer might have a disease of cancer but Ron Spencer's Affliction is that one day he's going to preach this message no come such a sweep that it'll change his body from Glory from Mortal immortality so your disease isn't your Affliction your Affliction is that the I am is in the building and all things are possible and this revival isn't just a rumor but there's a reality here you're Afflicted with the desire the potential that one day your prodigal is all going to walk through that back door your Affliction is that one day that sickness is going to leave your body and you're going to be well your Affliction is that one day your bodies are going to be changed and you're going to join your loved ones to meet him in the air your Affliction is that your joy is here your peace is here your Affliction is that you already made it your Affliction is that you're a Son of God and you can press through every battle your disease might be heavy your disease these might be weighing on you but your disease is not your Affliction you've recognize the potential that he's here that all things are possible do you hear it vibrating through the room I am that spoke to Moses
