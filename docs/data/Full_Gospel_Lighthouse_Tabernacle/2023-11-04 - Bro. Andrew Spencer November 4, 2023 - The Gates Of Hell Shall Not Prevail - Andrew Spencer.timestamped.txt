[25:00] let's just bow our
[25:01] heads gracious Heavenly Father Lord
[25:04] we're so thankful to be able to come and
[25:05] gather with you tonight Lord you know
[25:08] each and every trial that we went
[25:10] through and as we read across these
[25:12] prayer requests there's many many
[25:13] amongst us many across the bride that
[25:15] are that are in very dire need and if a
[25:19] doctor would come and tell us those
[25:20] reports surely surely Satan would come
[25:23] and strike us with fear but Lord Jesus
[25:25] you told us not to fear you told us to
[25:27] walk with you and you will take us
[25:29] through every trial every test that we
[25:31] we come up against and Lord Jesus you
[25:33] won't put us through anything that we
[25:35] cannot handle and no matter how big that
[25:38] demon stands in front of us and how how
[25:40] big he might be we take it back to our
[25:42] Prophet when he stood there and he saw
[25:43] that demon getting bigger and bigger in
[25:45] front of him and then he just began to
[25:47] speak the word and he just got smaller
[25:49] and smaller and he realized that it was
[25:51] you that was standing there behind him
[25:53] and it's you that's going to be standing
[25:54] there with us all the way Lord and I
[25:57] just ask that your your healing hand
[25:58] would come and and come across the
[26:00] building and not only that Lord there's
[26:02] there's many Souls that that need a
[26:04] touch from you and it's bigger than just
[26:06] a physical touch it's a spiritual touch
[26:09] that needs the Holy Ghost over top of
[26:11] Our Lives because we know if that token
[26:13] is not applied when when you come and I
[26:15] believe that day is very soon these
[26:17] people will be left behind and we've
[26:19] we've sat and we've listened to the word
[26:21] and maybe you've been here for 30 and 40
[26:23] years but if we our heart is not ready
[26:26] you will come and you will leave us
[26:28] right where we are sitting in the same
[26:29] condition that we've always set in and
[26:31] Lord Jesus my prayer tonight is that we
[26:34] would be able to leave this building
[26:35] tonight with a perfect love a perfect
[26:37] love with no matter who comes against us
[26:40] no matter what test or what what enemies
[26:43] come and say against us we can turn and
[26:45] say I forgive you and we turn and we we
[26:47] pray for that person that they may see
[26:49] the light that we have been given Lord
[26:51] and I just ask that we would just come
[26:53] and we would be able to pull on the gift
[26:54] tonight as brother Andrew's been
[26:56] inspired this week and he's been
[26:58] inspired to bring forth the word Lord
[27:00] Jesus I just ask that you would allow us
[27:01] to fall under that same anointing now
[27:03] Lord and just as our brother Ed Bisal is
[27:06] he would stay in there and he would be
[27:08] in the vision and and he wouldn't even
[27:09] recognize that he was the young boy in
[27:11] the Checker church allow us not to miss
[27:14] that Vision we've seen that we've seen
[27:17] that this is the time and the time and
[27:18] the Rapture is at hand allow us to
[27:21] recognize our place with you Lord allow
[27:23] us to be able to see what time it is and
[27:25] all the seals have been revealed all the
[27:27] Mysteries have been revealed the only
[27:29] thing left is a Rapture and your return
[27:31] Lord Jesus I ask that you would just
[27:33] come and you would anoint us now anoint
[27:35] brother rre and the song Services we
[27:37] have in Jesus name we pray amen and

[49:43] different way and about 12 12:30 today
[49:46] the Lord changed my changed my thought
[49:48] and it was coming so fast and I was
[49:50] writing it down as fast as I could and I
[49:52] I said like I said like that a colored
[49:54] lady said
[49:56] Lord Jesus you going to have to back off
[49:57] before you hurt me here so so so this be
[50:02] this will be new to us all here tonight
[50:04] I know not going to preach anything
[50:06] higher than you what you already know
[50:08] but the Lord was putting some things
[50:09] together for us today so we just trust
[50:11] the leadership of the Lords but I'd like
[50:13] to speak to you tonight on the Gates of
[50:15] Hell shall not Prevail Matthew chap 16
[50:19] ver 13 and when Jesus came into the
[50:21] coast of ciser Philippi he asked his
[50:24] disciples saying whom whom do men say
[50:26] that I the son of man am and they said
[50:29] some say thou art John the Baptist some
[50:32] say Elias and others jeremias or one of
[50:36] the prophets and he saith unto them but
[50:40] whom say ye that I am and Simon Peter
[50:44] answered and said Thou Art the Christ
[50:47] the son of the Living God and Jesus
[50:50] answered and said unto him blessed art
[50:52] thou Simon bar Jonah for flesh and blood
[50:55] hath not revealed it unto thee but my
[50:57] Father which is in heaven ain't that
[51:00] amazing hear Peter standing on Earth but
[51:02] the Father in heaven was revealing these
[51:05] things to him and I said also unto thee
[51:08] that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I
[51:11] will build my church and the Gates of
[51:14] Hell shall not Prevail against it and I
[51:17] will give unto thee the Keys of the
[51:19] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou
[51:21] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[51:24] heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose
[51:26] on Earth shall be loosed in heaven may
[51:29] God bless his word you may be seated in
[51:32] the presence of the Lord why don't you
[51:33] reach over and grab your neighbor and
[51:35] shake their hand and just tell them
[51:37] let's have church
[51:39] tonight now we know that Jesus was not a
[51:43] philosopher that was searching for truth
[51:47] he was
[51:49] truth he was truth he was not a Mystic
[51:52] but he is a reality he was not a
[51:54] reformer he is the creator is that right
[51:58] he was not a Visionary because he was
[52:00] the light of the world he never had the
[52:02] reason because he know all things Jesus
[52:05] he never was in a hurry and he never was
[52:07] afraid and he never showed weakness our
[52:11] Lord Jesus Christ he never hesitated and
[52:13] he always is ready he was always sure
[52:17] and there was shortess in all that he
[52:20] said and all that he ever did he had no
[52:23] sense of sin and he had no need of
[52:25] forgiveness he never sought or needed
[52:28] advice he knew why he came and he knew
[52:31] from whence he
[52:32] came he knew who he was and he knew who
[52:35] the father was and he knew all about
[52:37] heaven he knew where he was going and he
[52:39] knew all about humankind he knew who
[52:42] Satan was and he knew every imp and he
[52:44] knew every demon and he knew every name
[52:46] that could be named of all of hell he
[52:48] had no lack our lord Jesus has no
[52:51] limitations and you and I tonight sit
[52:54] here SE in Heavenly places and we are
[52:57] recreated in Christ Jesus we are in
[53:00] Christ and we are members of him Jesus
[53:05] had no fear so you don't have to have
[53:07] fear Jesus he had no defeat so you don't
[53:10] have to live in defeat he did not shrink
[53:13] and he did not shrink to the power of
[53:15] pain or to the brutal brutal treatment
[53:18] that he was under but he showed that he
[53:20] was the master of every circumstance
[53:22] when they arrested him he was Master he
[53:25] was Master at the trial he was Master at
[53:28] the cross he was Master at the grave and
[53:31] he was Master over all of hell he was
[53:34] and will forever be the almighty God yet
[53:37] he was just a man but to know that
[53:39] tonight he's living in you and I he's
[53:42] living right here he is the same
[53:44] yesterday today and forever and when
[53:47] Jesus was standing here in mortal flesh
[53:50] 2,000 years ago the Gates of Hell could
[53:52] not stand against him and they could not
[53:54] prev Prevail against him even though
[53:56] they were against him it did not have
[53:58] enough prevailing power to overcome
[54:01] anything that Jesus was and all that
[54:04] Jesus ever stood for could never be
[54:06] defeated even though it looked like on
[54:08] Friday that they had defeated Jesus on
[54:11] the cross he was never
[54:14] defeated he was never defeated and to
[54:16] think that tonight that our Lord Jesus
[54:18] Christ is still the mighty conqueror
[54:21] even after 2,000 years he is still
[54:23] winning battles and he still fighting
[54:26] for us and to think that tonight that
[54:28] God sent us a message he didn't send us
[54:30] a message just to give us another church
[54:32] or to bring us another move he didn't
[54:34] give us a message just to build another
[54:36] church or just to have another
[54:38] Association but he brought us a message
[54:40] that would loose Us by the power of the
[54:43] loosing of the Seven Seals a body body
[54:46] word people that have been loosed by the
[54:48] preaching of Malachi 4 to recognize that
[54:52] we have been loosed to believe that all
[54:54] things are possible possible loose to
[54:56] believe that Satan has no power over the
[54:59] Church of the Living God and to think
[55:01] that tonight it was because of this
[55:02] message that called you by name that has
[55:05] given you authority to recognize like
[55:07] Peter was standing there and he was
[55:09] recognizing that this was a revelation
[55:11] that didn't come from William brandham
[55:13] himself it didn't come from his mama and
[55:15] it didn't come from his daddy but this
[55:17] Revelation that you have received of the
[55:19] message of the hour is just like Peter
[55:22] received it it came from the father
[55:24] above that's why it can't be a mama and
[55:26] a daddy experience for our young people
[55:29] they've got to know Jesus Christ by a
[55:31] born again true Revelation a born again
[55:34] experience baptized from the brains all
[55:36] the way to their toes they've got to be
[55:38] birthed under the kingdom of almighty
[55:40] God that's why our young people cannot
[55:43] be built upon intellectualism neither
[55:45] can they be built upon knowledge they've
[55:47] got to be built upon sound Doctrine you
[55:50] can't build these young people up on
[55:52] emotion and you can't build them up on
[55:54] their own religion and you can't build
[55:55] them up on legalism you got to build
[55:57] them up on the fundamental foundational
[56:00] faith that is the Bible Doctrine by the
[56:02] Bible word because if you just give them
[56:04] legalism it'll constrain their worship
[56:07] it'll constrain their life yet they
[56:09] can't be built upon a dead religion
[56:11] either they've got to be built upon the
[56:13] power of the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus
[56:16] gave us a Living Word not a dead word
[56:20] because the Holy Ghost is not a teaching
[56:22] the Holy Ghost is not a learned behavior
[56:25] it is not a Reformation it's a
[56:27] transformation and Jesus cared so much
[56:30] that he gave you a message that's got
[56:32] power behind it that's got Authority
[56:35] behind it and he told us that the gates
[56:37] of hell would not Prevail against this
[56:41] church well praise the Lord Brother bam
[56:44] said he said but today we have little
[56:46] Sensations and little isms and and that
[56:48] breaks us up and separates and little
[56:51] evidences and little everything else
[56:53] that separates us he said it's shows
[56:55] that we never come to that place where
[56:57] we're completely sold out to the
[56:58] almighty God and to stand on the pillar
[57:01] of his Eternal Word and say I now claim
[57:04] the faith that was once delivered to the
[57:06] Saints he said not from your lips but
[57:09] from your
[57:10] heart not from your lips but from your
[57:13] heart not an intellectual conception but
[57:15] a born again experience that makes you a
[57:17] changeed creature he said that's the
[57:20] faith that was once delivered to the
[57:22] Saints he said that's why you see people
[57:25] that some of them are on the housetop
[57:26] all the time others say well I I was
[57:28] healed yesterday but bless God I lost my
[57:30] healing he said you never had it to
[57:32] begin with he said but when that word is
[57:35] once anchored all devils in Hell
[57:37] couldn't shake you away from it because
[57:39] Upon This Rock I will build my church
[57:42] and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[57:44] against it what is it it is the
[57:46] spiritual revealed truth of Jesus Christ
[57:49] and when Jesus was standing there and
[57:51] told him Upon This Rock I will build my
[57:54] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[57:55] Prevail against it he was showing to us
[57:58] that Jesus was showing to us there at
[58:00] CIS Philippi that the gates of hell
[58:02] would be against us it shows us that
[58:05] hell would be against the Revelation not
[58:06] just the church but it would be against
[58:08] the revelation of what the church is
[58:10] built on but the gates of hell has been
[58:13] trying for over 2,000 years to Prevail
[58:16] against the Revelation that is in the
[58:18] body of Jesus Christ and it did not
[58:20] Prevail then and it will not Prevail now
[58:23] it has wared after years year after year
[58:25] time after time and it has went down in
[58:27] defeat but I'd say that you showed up to
[58:30] church tonight to show to the devil you
[58:32] are going down in defeat one more day
[58:35] you'll say well you have no idea what
[58:37] I've been through you still showed up
[58:39] here tonight and you got Gung it you got
[58:41] air in your lungs you got energy in your
[58:43] body you got a right mind to come to the
[58:45] house of God you say you can say well
[58:47] I've I've been through hell I went
[58:49] through hell I walked through hell I've
[58:51] walked through all all kinds of
[58:53] circumstances but you still had enough
[58:55] gumption to show the devil whose side
[58:58] you're on it's proof tonight that Jesus
[59:00] is still Jesus he's not a god of the
[59:03] Bible of days gone by he's the god of
[59:05] right now he's the god of my future he's
[59:08] the god of my
[59:10] past well blessed be the name of the
[59:13] Lord if it didn't stop Paul and it
[59:15] didn't stop Peter then the Gates of Hell
[59:18] will never Prevail against the body of
[59:21] Jesus
[59:23] Christ Hallelujah
[59:25] [Applause]
[59:27] now David said in Psalm 69 and2 that
[59:30] they that sit in the gate speak against
[59:32] me and I was the song of the drunkard
[59:36] Hallelujah I was the song of the
[59:39] drunkards you see the gates of a city it
[59:43] doesn't matter where they are throughout
[59:46] the cities the gates were always a place
[59:48] of concourse they were places where
[59:51] business was transacted it was a place
[59:54] where courts were frequently held at was
[59:57] at the gates and here all of the powers
[1:00:01] that be that that were setting there all
[1:00:03] the high ranking officials all the
[1:00:05] magistrates were a part of the Cry of
[1:00:08] reproach that was against David David
[1:00:11] was subject to town
[1:00:14] talk he was subject to town talk and
[1:00:17] everybody knows that good news it goes
[1:00:20] It goes only about an inch but bad news
[1:00:23] goes about a mile
[1:00:25] but even though David was sitting here
[1:00:27] and he was saying that the gates that
[1:00:29] these Gates that they that set by all
[1:00:32] the magistrates all the high-ranking
[1:00:33] officials all the magistrates they speak
[1:00:36] evil against me at the gate you see it
[1:00:39] shows to us that demons and mockers will
[1:00:41] always be against us but David didn't
[1:00:44] stop right there and listen to The Voice
[1:00:47] to the voices of the gates of hell but
[1:00:49] verse 13 it says but as for me what are
[1:00:53] you going to do with when hell shows up
[1:00:55] at your house what are you going to do
[1:00:58] when all hell turns loose on your family
[1:01:00] but David said but as for
[1:01:04] me do I have a David in the house of God
[1:01:07] tonight but as for me my prayer is unto
[1:01:10] thee in an acceptable time you see in my
[1:01:13] mocking I will pray to you in my defeat
[1:01:16] I will praise
[1:01:17] you come on somebody when in my weakness
[1:01:21] I will praise you when my victory I will
[1:01:23] glorify you in my sickness I will pray
[1:01:28] you you see you can sit there and you
[1:01:30] can listen to all the hounds of Hell
[1:01:32] Whispering all kinds of lies of you but
[1:01:34] you have got to turn your eyes and focus
[1:01:37] them on the one thing that will always
[1:01:40] remain
[1:01:41] same mockers will change face to face
[1:01:44] there'll be two fa today and eight faces
[1:01:46] tomorrow but there is one God one Lord
[1:01:49] One Faith who is above all through all
[1:01:52] and in you all he's not changing and
[1:01:54] he's not going
[1:01:56] away that's why David would say that the
[1:01:59] Lord is my light he is my light and my
[1:02:03] salvation of Whom Shall I Fear the Lord
[1:02:06] is the strength of my life of whom shall
[1:02:08] I be afraid when the wicked even my
[1:02:10] enemies and my foes came up upon me to
[1:02:12] eat up my flesh they
[1:02:16] stumbled are you hearing me all the
[1:02:18] gates of hell they stumbled you're not
[1:02:21] going to fall but they're going to fall
[1:02:24] stumbled it's time that you turn that
[1:02:28] finger around on the devil it's time he
[1:02:31] starts pointing he keeps pointing out
[1:02:32] things in your family things in your
[1:02:34] life things in your future that you
[1:02:37] can't even control yourself but it's
[1:02:39] time you turn the scriptures loose on
[1:02:44] him they stumbled and fell though a host
[1:02:47] should encamp against me my heart shall
[1:02:49] not fear the war should arise against me
[1:02:52] in this will I be confident yes in this
[1:02:56] will I be confident the Lord is my light
[1:03:00] and my
[1:03:02] salvation what did he say in Isaiah 59
[1:03:06] and 19 that when the enemy shall come in
[1:03:08] like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:03:10] shall lift up a standard against him

[1:13:14] cry oh City thou oh pelia palestinia art
[1:13:19] dissolved for Thou shalt come from the
[1:13:21] north I smoke and None Shall be alone in
[1:13:25] his appointed
[1:13:29] time Katie was showing me a video just
[1:13:32] just before service I didn't say nothing
[1:13:35] to her cuz I knew that the Lord had
[1:13:36] dropped this scripture in my heart
[1:13:39] today but it showed a they couldn't
[1:13:41] explain it but it looked like it was a
[1:13:43] great big pillar of smoke coming coming
[1:13:46] straight out of the earth and it was
[1:13:48] covering all the land of
[1:13:51] Israel how oh great oh gate cry oh City

[1:13:58] Thou shalt come from the north a smoke
[1:14:01] and None Shall be alone in his appointed
[1:14:04] time so let me put that in layman's
[1:14:06] terms that not even a straggler will
[1:14:09] make it out of the
[1:14:11] city Palestine can go over there in
[1:14:14] Israel right now and they can go over
[1:14:16] there and try to destroy all of
[1:14:20] Israel now you know good and well that
[1:14:22] that that in IND times that they would
[1:14:24] send out smoke cigal when they was
[1:14:26] trying to figure out when they was
[1:14:27] trying to figure out when they was
[1:14:29] trying to send it to their parties that
[1:14:30] were across the land they would send out
[1:14:32] a smoke signal and said it's time for
[1:14:35] war but the Bible is saying to us that
[1:14:38] the signal of War for the children of
[1:14:41] Israel is the pillar of cloud and the
[1:14:45] pillar of
[1:14:47] fire you don't even recognize what is
[1:14:49] happening right now but the pillar of
[1:14:51] fire is in the room and is sending a
[1:14:54] signal to hell that the King of Kings
[1:14:57] has showed up to do damage to the powers
[1:15:00] of
[1:15:05] hell it's a smoke signal when the pillar
[1:15:08] fire shows up hell's about to
[1:15:12] lose what happened out there in Portland
[1:15:14] Oregon when that Maniac thought he was
[1:15:16] going to do all of his might and destroy
[1:15:18] the prophet he'd done it to many of
[1:15:20] preachers out there but this time he

[1:15:27] well I got news for all of hell we that
[1:15:30] kind of Believers tonight we still
[1:15:32] following that same Prophet that told
[1:15:35] that demon tonight you'll bow over my

[1:15:42] and he challenging you to
[1:15:45] believe I am your weapons of warfare you
[1:15:48] cannot lose you cannot go down in
[1:15:52] defeat verse 32 what shall one then say
[1:15:56] or answer The Messengers of the
[1:15:59] nation what shall you say to all the
[1:16:01] nations out there what are you going to

[1:16:09] Holy Ghost move that the Lord has
[1:16:11] founded this Zion the Lord has founded
[1:16:19] Israel Hallelujah the Lord has founded
[1:16:22] this
[1:16:24] and the poor of his people shall trust
[1:16:28] in it what Jesus say my sheep know my
[1:16:31] voice they hear my voice and a stranger
[1:16:33] they will not follow what did he say I
[1:16:36] give unto them eternal life and they
[1:16:38] shall never perish neither shall any man
[1:16:40] pluck them out of my hand my Father
[1:16:42] which gave them me is greater than all
[1:16:44] no man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:16:46] father's hand and I my father are one

[1:17:15] prosper is that right and it ain't by
[1:17:18] your might and it ain't by your power
[1:17:20] but it's by his Spirit sayith the Lord
[1:17:23] and any Warrior that thinks they're
[1:17:24] going to go out there and defeat the
[1:17:26] enemy on their own accord or By Their
[1:17:28] Own Strength ain't God's
[1:17:31] Warrior come on somebody if you think
[1:17:33] you're going to do this on your own
[1:17:34] you're going to find out real quick that
[1:17:36] defeat ain't far distant away from
[1:17:39] you but the Bible said it's not by might

[1:22:16] invincible
[1:22:17] Army I tell you right now Satan can do

[1:23:02] they do not find the very first portion
[1:23:04] of that scripture submit yourself
[1:23:06] therefore unto God surrender yourself
[1:23:10] you are never going to win with an
[1:23:12] unsurrendered heart you're never going
[1:23:15] to overcome that's why you find people
[1:23:17] well bless God I my feelings got hurt
[1:23:20] tonight and I guess I'm going to quit
[1:23:21] church or I'm going to give up and I
[1:23:24] they didn't sing my song
[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:28] tonight it's because they are serving
[1:23:31] God from an unsurrendered
[1:23:37] heart let me tell you something when you
[1:23:40] go over there and you start reading
[1:23:41] about Samson I'm gonna get to him just a
[1:23:42] little bit later Lord willing but when
[1:23:45] you start reading about Samson laying
[1:23:47] his head in Li of's
[1:23:49] lap what was the first sign it was a
[1:23:53] sign of
[1:23:56] uncommit the next sign and she started
[1:23:59] shaving off his uncommit and she started
[1:24:02] shaving off his pride I got this I got
[1:24:07] control of this I can handle this come
[1:24:10] on somebody I can live this in
[1:24:14] church I can live this around my peeps I
[1:24:17] can live this come on somebody I know
[1:24:20] that's one of y'all New Age kind of talk
[1:24:22] ain't it
[1:24:24] peeps it's chill
[1:24:33] he where's Jay at I need him he knows
[1:24:37] that lingual and he teaches it to
[1:24:41] me but what did he do she started
[1:24:44] shaving off those Seven Locks I've got
[1:24:47] this I've got this I've got this figured
[1:24:49] out I'm okay I've defeated lions and
[1:24:52] I've defeated all all these Philistines
[1:24:54] I've I've tied a thousand foxes together
[1:24:56] I've I've defeated all of these enemies
[1:24:58] before he got confident he got confident
[1:25:02] in his own stature but Jesus is not
[1:25:06] building a church that is built upon
[1:25:09] their own strength he's building a
[1:25:12] church that's fully
[1:25:16] committed come on somebody but don't you
[1:25:19] pay no attention to what the devil says
[1:25:21] to you
[1:25:23] if he tells you you're uncommitted
[1:25:25] that's proof to me right there I am
[1:25:27] committed might be committed to an aane
[1:25:29] institution one these SP but I am
[1:25:31] committed to the Lord Jesus
[1:25:33] Christ you see we've got a building to
[1:25:36] build we got a church to build and you
[1:25:38] cannot stop and listen to the lies of
[1:25:41] the devil and the critics that are
[1:25:43] sounding off their sounds of hell but
[1:25:46] we've got a church to build by the
[1:25:48] blueprints of the word and when you
[1:25:51] build it according to to the revelation
[1:25:52] of Jesus Christ the gates of
[1:25:56] hell that's why William Brandon would
[1:25:58] say to you that you're not feeding on
[1:26:00] the mind of a man but you're feeding on
[1:26:01] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:26:03] man I'm not building you up on emotion
[1:26:06] I'm not building you up on my mind I'm
[1:26:08] not building you up on William brownon
[1:26:10] the man I'm building you up on the
[1:26:11] message of the
[1:26:13] Angel and when you build a church that
[1:26:15] kind of
[1:26:18] way Satan knows no
[1:26:21] defeat like what's coming to
[1:26:24] him Satan might think that he's got the
[1:26:27] upper arm or the upper hand on you but
[1:26:30] when God shows up it looked all right in
[1:26:33] legion's life as long as Jesus wasn't in
[1:26:36] the picture but when Jesus gets past the
[1:26:39] storm and he starts walking on the banks
[1:26:42] of gadara and he starts walking up there
[1:26:45] Legion is about to get a new name and
[1:26:48] hell has been against the church all of
[1:26:51] these years but she does not realize
[1:26:53] hell does not realize that Jesus is
[1:26:56] showing
[1:26:58] up you remember that story about
[1:27:01] that that
[1:27:03] woman that woman that
[1:27:06] was that was brought there ambulance
[1:27:09] wouldn't take
[1:27:10] her and and she was completely she was
[1:27:13] actually in an instain
[1:27:15] institution and and her husband wanted
[1:27:19] to get her into brother Brandon's
[1:27:20] meetings everybody all right
[1:27:24] and he was trying to get her into
[1:27:26] brother brandom's meetings and so these
[1:27:28] guys took a took a station wagon and
[1:27:31] they and they they put her in there five
[1:27:33] guys couldn't hold her down she kicked
[1:27:34] out she kicked out the windows out of
[1:27:36] the back end of that station wagon and
[1:27:38] and they put her down there in the
[1:27:40] basement of that Auditorium where
[1:27:41] brother brandham was and brother
[1:27:42] brandham was called down there that
[1:27:43] Auditorium and brother Bram brother
[1:27:46] Baron was down there they called him
[1:27:47] down there and he he started seeing her
[1:27:49] like that and she was bleeding all over
[1:27:50] legs where she kicked out that glass
[1:27:53] and he said what happened here so the
[1:27:55] husband be to tell the story that she'd
[1:27:57] been in this insane Institution for 2
[1:27:59] years and didn't know her own name
[1:28:00] didn't know her she she completely lost
[1:28:02] her mind mother band said well I'll go
[1:28:04] over and talk to her and the husband
[1:28:06] said no don't do that you she'll kill
[1:28:08] you so brother man said he said I walked
[1:28:10] over there and he said I I took her by
[1:28:11] the hand I took her by the hand and he
[1:28:13] said I shook her hand and he said I I he
[1:28:16] said how do you do and brother Bram said
[1:28:18] that that woman in all of her strength
[1:28:21] said it was n't her said but it was
[1:28:23] another Power he said she had completely
[1:28:26] yielded herself to that
[1:28:29] power it's amazing and he said here she
[1:28:32] was a little B old woman and he said she
[1:28:34] about flung me across a room and said
[1:28:37] she started slithering on her back like
[1:28:40] a snake you know the story she started
[1:28:43] slithering on her back like a snake and
[1:28:44] said William brandom you have nothing to
[1:28:47] do with me and the husband said how did
[1:28:49] she know your name she ain't even spoken
[1:28:51] to years she don't even know she don't
[1:28:53] even know her name brother R said that's
[1:28:55] not that's not her talking that's the
[1:28:59] power that she yielded to that's
[1:29:01] speaking out of
[1:29:02] her he said William brandham you have
[1:29:05] nothing to do with me he said but the
[1:29:07] Jesus I represent
[1:29:11] does you see the Jesus that I represent
[1:29:14] here
[1:29:14] tonight hell might think that that I
[1:29:17] don't have nothing to do with your life
[1:29:19] and Hell might think that that that I'm
[1:29:21] speaking things that are that maybe
[1:29:23] maybe don't make no sense to you but the
[1:29:25] Jesus that I represent has got
[1:29:27] everything to do with your
[1:29:31] life brother Bram said I simply prayed
[1:29:34] the prayer of faith over her and said
[1:29:36] send her back to the
[1:29:38] doctors and let them dismiss her he
[1:29:42] didn't take her off medication the
[1:29:44] doctors took her off
[1:29:46] medication Hallelujah the doctors
[1:29:49] dismissed her and in two days she was
[1:29:52] backing her right mind the very next
[1:29:54] week she was sitting in William bram's
[1:29:57] meeting and became a pastor's
[1:30:01] wife don't tell me God can't take a
[1:30:08] nobody Satan will do all that he can to
[1:30:11] interrupt God's
[1:30:13] plans he'll do everything I was
[1:30:15] listening to souls that now are in
[1:30:17] prison when brother random is preaching
[1:30:19] and I found I have always found was
[1:30:22] amazing but I was listening to it this
[1:30:23] week and reminded me there brother
[1:30:25] random he's getting ready to go he's
[1:30:27] getting ready to go into the vision of
[1:30:28] hell he goes to he tells us about J C
[1:30:30] penny about seeing those women there
[1:30:32] those cat eyes and that that makeup all
[1:30:34] over her face and you remember you
[1:30:36] remember the story when brother brandham
[1:30:38] is getting ready you can hear him he's
[1:30:40] getting ready to move into the vision of
[1:30:41] it and all of a sudden there's an
[1:30:44] interruption in the back end of the
[1:30:46] church and it's a lady back there and
[1:30:49] they called to him said she's beginning
[1:30:51] to faint back there
[1:30:52] and and so he prays he prays over and
[1:30:54] said Lord touch her and then he goes
[1:30:56] into the vision again and then all of a
[1:30:58] sudden another Interruption they brought
[1:31:00] her up here and he prayed for her what
[1:31:02] was hell trying to do it was trying to
[1:31:04] stop from getting this this vision of
[1:31:08] Hell On Tape because if you see through
[1:31:11] a prophet's
[1:31:13] lens he said whatever I got to do I
[1:31:16] would persuade men not to go
[1:31:19] there you see what hell was trying to do
[1:31:22] it was trying to interrupt God's plans
[1:31:26] for telling a bride that's not your
[1:31:28] dwelling place that's not your
[1:31:31] destiny come on somebody hell was not
[1:31:34] created for you it was created for the
[1:31:37] devil and his angels you got nothing to
[1:31:39] do with
[1:31:43] hell the only thing you got to do with
[1:31:46] hell is to conquer
[1:31:49] it you have no idea what I've been
[1:31:51] through through you've got every right
[1:31:53] to look at Hell in its face and say get
[1:31:56] back to hell where you came
[1:31:58] from come
[1:32:03] on come on somebody don't act like you
[1:32:06] got your angles angels Wings on right
[1:32:08] now you got every right as a son and
[1:32:11] daughter of God when the demon of
[1:32:13] Torment comes and torment your family
[1:32:16] and torment your mind turn your faith
[1:32:19] loose on that devil you've got more
[1:32:21] power than all the angels in heaven
[1:32:23] you're a son and daughter of the most
[1:32:26] high God tell hell I have nothing to do
[1:32:29] with you and you have nothing to do with
[1:32:31] [Applause]
[1:32:40] me I'd like to title this portion of the
[1:32:44] sermon Satan's
[1:32:48] defeat is all right to have two sermons
[1:32:50] in one sermon yeah Satan's defeat
[1:32:53] because if you look at the Bible in 1
[1:32:55] John 3 and8 it says for this purpose
[1:32:57] somebody say for this purpose the Son of
[1:33:00] God was manifested that he might destroy
[1:33:02] the works of the devil but look at
[1:33:05] Colossians chapter 2 and 15 and having
[1:33:08] spoiled principalities and Powers he
[1:33:10] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:33:12] over them in it so according to the
[1:33:15] Bible Jesus has destroyed the works of
[1:33:18] the devil he has spoiled his power he
[1:33:21] has triumphed over
[1:33:23] hell so we must recognize that Satan is
[1:33:28] a defeated foe that Jesus's Triumph was
[1:33:32] my Triumph his victory was my victory he
[1:33:36] did nothing for himself he did it all
[1:33:38] for you and me he defeated Satan for us
[1:33:41] he spoiled all of its principalities and
[1:33:44] all of its powers so if Satan has got a
[1:33:47] hold of you it's got a hold of you by an
[1:33:49] illegal possession
[1:33:59] okay if Satan's got a hold of
[1:34:02] you he got a hold of you he got a hold
[1:34:05] of your mind he got a hold of this well
[1:34:07] it's going to be this long it's going to
[1:34:08] be this it's going to be this far my I I
[1:34:12] know what I'm talking about I saw
[1:34:15] it that Satan will put that little doubt
[1:34:17] in there and he'll try to put it for a
[1:34:19] day in the future
[1:34:22] but if he's got a hold of your mind if
[1:34:24] he's got a hold of your marriage if he's
[1:34:27] got a hold of your future husband if
[1:34:29] he's got a few if he's got a hold of
[1:34:31] your Holy Ghost if he's got a hold of
[1:34:33] your dance if he's got a hold of your
[1:34:34] shout if he's got a hold of your joy if
[1:34:37] he's got a hold of your peace if he's
[1:34:39] got a hold of your family if he's got a
[1:34:41] hold hold of your health he is holding
[1:34:43] it by an illegal
[1:34:47] possession he's defeated tonight so if
[1:34:51] he he is holding you he is holding a
[1:34:53] hold of the master that created
[1:34:58] him that's strong brother Andrew I tell
[1:35:01] you how strong it is if you got the Holy
[1:35:03] Ghost living on the inside of you then
[1:35:06] you've got the master of the universe
[1:35:09] and if Satan has put one little chain of
[1:35:11] of Affliction or doubt in your mind he's
[1:35:14] got a hold of the master of the universe
[1:35:17] it's time Hallelujah this ain't some
[1:35:20] Genie In A B
[1:35:21] it's time you turn loose the power of
[1:35:24] the most high God on the Dynamics of
[1:35:34] hell what Jesus say and these signs
[1:35:38] shall follow them that
[1:35:41] believe I want you to exercise your
[1:35:44] faith real quick Lay Your Hands over
[1:35:46] there on your
[1:35:48] neighbor and these signs shall follow
[1:35:51] them
[1:35:52] that believe in my
[1:35:54] name in my name they shall cast out
[1:35:56] devils in my name they shall take up
[1:35:58] serpents in my name that shall drink and
[1:36:00] a deadly thing and it shall not harm
[1:36:02] them in my name that shall lay hands on
[1:36:05] the sick and they shall recover if
[1:36:08] Satan's got a hold of your life he's
[1:36:10] holding a hold of you illegally tonight
[1:36:12] and you've got the authority of the Holy
[1:36:15] Ghost to stand there and say Satan take
[1:36:17] your hands off of God's Property

[1:36:34] saying this to you according to the
[1:36:36] dream that was shown to the to the
[1:36:39] prophet and he said I seen them people
[1:36:42] down there and they were screaming out

[1:36:55] do it on my own strength he said but

[1:40:35] I'll call it modern events being made
[1:40:36] clear by prophecy I feel like I'm in a
[1:40:39] moment and William brandom recognized
[1:40:41] when he was in the vision when he was in
[1:40:43] the vision are you in the vision and
[1:40:45] when he recognized he was in the vision
[1:40:47] and he read recognized the panoramic he
[1:40:50] recognized this was the boy he said you
[1:40:52] can line up every devil in hell and he
[1:40:55] said they couldn't stop the vision to
[1:40:56] comeing to
[1:40:57] pass you're not some dead fining boy

[1:41:12] Rapture stop him right now dead in his
[1:41:14] tracks pull the shotgun out and pull
[1:41:17] both bubble D both double barrels on him

[1:42:10] traps I've had enough of your
[1:42:18] plans I know hell ain't accustom this
[1:42:20] kind of service but this is the kind of
[1:42:21] service that we were bornn
[1:42:26] for if God would turn the
[1:42:30] word surely he would say I got you on my
[1:42:33] mind surely you'd recognize he's talking
[1:42:36] to
[1:42:39] you what is
[1:42:41] it he's going to have somebody that's
[1:42:44] willing to show that they are possessors
[1:42:48] of the Gate of the
[1:42:49] enemy
[1:42:52] come on Samson you got it in you brother
[1:42:54] Charles a pillar of fire could be so
[1:42:56] close to you it could stand right there
[1:42:58] and watch over your life and raise you
[1:43:00] up for a moment like you're standing in
[1:43:03] it's because he's destined you for this

[1:43:08] you were not destined for Satan's
[1:43:13] plans come on Samson you're born for
[1:43:17] this purpose come on Samson come on
[1:43:20] Samson get your head out of the wrong
[1:43:22] place come on
[1:43:25] Samson you're born with a
[1:43:31] power the Bible said in judges 16 and
[1:43:34] I'm closing fast as I
[1:43:38] can but Samson had got himself in a bad
[1:43:44] spot he found himself in a harlot's
[1:43:49] house
[1:43:52] you ain't that bad off you sitting there
[1:43:54] in the house of
[1:43:58] God you ain't that bad
[1:44:01] off come on now you ain't that bad off
[1:44:04] you ain't about to give
[1:44:06] up you had something on the inside of
[1:44:13] you call it whatever you want
[1:44:16] to but about midnight Samson woke up and
[1:44:20] he was realizing that he was living in
[1:44:22] the wrong
[1:44:24] house and when he rose
[1:44:27] up I say it was the angel of Lord that
[1:44:29] went down there woke Samson up he said
[1:44:31] you in the wrong house and the
[1:44:33] Philistines are outside of the city they
[1:44:36] have found out that you are living in
[1:44:38] the wrong house and they are coming down
[1:44:40] here to destroy you but when Samson got
[1:44:42] woke up by the angel of the
[1:44:44] Lord something got woke up on the inside
[1:44:47] of Samson and Samson went out there and
[1:44:50] grabbed a hold of the gates of gssa and
[1:44:53] he took them 36 miles and put them up
[1:44:56] there on top of hibron so that all the
[1:45:00] world could see he climbed 36 miles went
[1:45:04] up 3,200 ft in
[1:45:08] altitude something got woke up on the
[1:45:11] inside of
[1:45:12] Samson it said that an average man
[1:45:15] carrying 550 lbs it putting out 0.5
[1:45:19] horsepower
[1:45:21] I don't know an average man that can
[1:45:22] carry 550 lbs but I want to meet that
[1:45:24] guy but it said that's what sence says
[1:45:27] that an average man carrying 550 lbs is
[1:45:30] putting out 0.5 horsepower Samson was
[1:45:34] putting out 28.5
[1:45:36] horsepower carrying not 550 lbs he was
[1:45:40] carrying
[1:45:42] 10,700 lb all the way up to
[1:45:45] 21,400
[1:45:47] lb amen don't you tell me you ain't got
[1:45:51] enough when you got Jesus you got more
[1:45:54] than
[1:45:55] enough come on somebody if Samson did
[1:45:59] not have the Holy Ghost and had enough
[1:46:01] power to carry not only Gates but he
[1:46:04] carried the post and he carried the bars
[1:46:06] 36 miles it's time you take a walk down
[1:46:10] the aisle and show hell whose side you
[1:46:19] own
[1:46:24] but let me point you let me change your
[1:46:25] vision real
[1:46:28] quick Samson fell Samson found himself
[1:46:31] grinding at the
[1:46:33] Mill he had a lot of power when the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost would strike him but let me point
[1:46:38] you to a
[1:46:47] man you know what it's like when you
[1:46:49] fall
[1:46:54] you know what it's like when you fall
[1:46:56] and you feel that guilt on you and
[1:46:57] you're so
[1:46:59] heavy it's heavy guilt is a very heavy
[1:47:03] place and you find people that are
[1:47:05] always living from their past it shows
[1:47:08] they haven't caught the vision of their
[1:47:10] future yet but if they can ever capture
[1:47:14] their future to me that's my greatest
[1:47:16] job as a pastor a preacher is to turn
[1:47:19] your vision away from your past and your
[1:47:22] future but you recognize what the power
[1:47:24] of sin does it makes you depressed it
[1:47:28] makes you start popping anxiety pills it
[1:47:30] makes you start seeing psychiatrist it
[1:47:31] makes you start seeing a
[1:47:34] psychologist that's what sin does to you
[1:47:36] it makes you feel so dirty so
[1:47:41] guilty but this
[1:47:43] man this man he didn't just take one of
[1:47:46] your sins he took
[1:47:49] all
[1:47:51] he took
[1:47:53] all your
[1:47:59] sins 7 billion people in the
