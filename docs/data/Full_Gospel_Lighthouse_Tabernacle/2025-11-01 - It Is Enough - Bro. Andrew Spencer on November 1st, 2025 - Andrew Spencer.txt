Gracious heavenly father, Lord, what what great privilege it is to be able to come and [music] step into the building tonight and just be able to come and bask in your presence, Lord, and be able to lay everything at your feet that that we have came up against this week. And [music] Lord, we know that we know that you hear our prayers. And Lord, you just want to hear us come to you and talk to you, Lord. and not just some simple prayer that we would just ask you of things but Lord to [music] be able to thank you for the blessings and thank you for the opportunities that you have given us in this life and great friends and great fellowship Lord great great pastors Lord a building that we could [music] come to and Lord as we say that we just we we could just feel for the believers in Jamaica the ones that [music] Lord they would go through such turmoil and a storm this week and they would see just properties and their buildings destroyed and but Lord Jesus we're so thankful that the [music] reports have came that no lives would be lost. And for my knowledge, Lord, and Lord, any injuries or anything that [music] would come from that, Lord, we just we just pray that they would just be able to feel the prayers from around the world that would just go and [music] be there with them. And Lord Jesus, you saw the storms before it would get there. And Lord Jesus, we know that when you bring storms, [music] it's it's to be able to bring us closer to you. And those storms do nothing but strengthen us, Lord. And we [music] know that Paul would say that we would be grateful in the trials and grateful in the in the test, Lord. and each and everything that we would go through. I would just pray that we would be able to see you in it and be able to give you all the glory and praise [music] back. And Lord, we're so thankful to be able to see our pastors back home and be able to hear the great miracles and great testimonies of what they brought overseas. And Lord, I just ask that you would just bless them for going and going and being there with the people. And we recognize that it is a bride not just here in Elton, Virginia, but it's a bride all around the world. And we need to stand together like never before and be able to put our arms together and be able to walk because [music] there is great darkness. But Lord Jesus, you've given us a light. You've given us a light to be able to spread to the world and allow those that may not be believers be able to see that there is still God on this earth [music] and they they can reach out to us and be able to ask for a prayer in need. Lord, I just ask that you would just be with our pastor here tonight [music] as he would just bring forth the word. Be with him and ignite the words and inspire him to be able to just bring the word to draw us higher to you. Be there with Matt as he's at home. I believe that you could just touch his back [music] right where he is at. And we just thank you for all that you are doing. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. As we prepare to take up the offering, we'll sing I'll fly away. Amen. Then April and Julia will sing. We'll get it right. Amen. Amen. You know, there's a verse in this that [music] says just a few more weary days. But I heard the words of a prophet and he told me never to let my testimony [music] be negative. So I'm not claiming any weary days. Just a few more victorious days. How about that? Amen. Some glad morning [singing] when this life is over. Oh, I fly my way to a [singing and music] home on God's special shore. I thy way. Oh, [singing] thy [music] way. your [singing] glory. I fly away. [music] I can die [singing] in a rapture by and by my way. [music] We must shadow [singing] of this life have gone. [music] Oh wow. Fly [singing] away like [music] a bird from prison bars has flown. I [singing] fly away. Oh, I Oh, [singing] glory. I fly away. [singing and music] I can't die. I'm taking a rapture [music and singing] by and by. I don't claim those weary days. [music] just a [singing] few more victorious days and I fly away [music] to where joy shall never end. Amen. Who's going with me? Oh, I fly away. your glory. I'll fly by awake in [music] the morning. I'll not [singing] die. I'm taking a rapture by and [music] by away. [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Almighty [music] God, the great I am. [music] Unmovable [singing] rock, omnipotent, powerful, awesome [singing] Lord, [music] victorious [singing] warrior, commanding [music and singing] king of kings, mighty conqueror, and the only [music] time, the [singing] The only [music] time I ever saw him run [music] is when he [singing] ran to me. He took me in his arms, held my [music] head to his chest, sent my [singing] son's come home again, lifting my [music] face, wiped the tears [singing] from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice. [music] He said, "Son, you know I still love you." [music] He caught [singing] me by surprise when God ran. [music] The day [singing] I left home, I knew I'd [music] broken his heart. heart. I wondered [music and singing] then if things could ever be the same. [music] Then one night [singing] I remembered his love for me. [music] And down that dusty road [singing] ahead I [music] could see. It was the only time. It [music and singing] was the only time I ever saw him run. When he ran to me, [music] he took me in his arms held my head to his [music] chest. said, "My son's come home again." Lifted [music] my face, wiped [singing] the tears from my eyes. With forgiveness [music] in his voice, he said, "Son, [singing] you know [music] I still love you." He caught [music and singing] me by surprise and [music] he brought [singing] me to my knees when God [singing] ran. [music] I [singing] was so ashamed all [music] alone [singing] and so far away. [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; And now I know he's been waiting [singing] for this day. [music] I saw him run [singing] to me. He took me [music] in his arms and my head to his chest. Said [music and singing] my son come home again. Lifted my face. wiped the [music and singing] tears from my eyes. With forgiveness in his voice, I felt his love for [music] me again. He ran to me. He took me in his arms, [singing] held my head [music] to his chest, sent my son, [singing] come home again, lifted my face, wiped [music and singing] the tears from my eyes with forgiveness in his voice. He said [singing] son. He [music] called me [singing] son. He [singing] said, "Son, you know I still love you." He read to me. [singing] [music] I saw him run [music] to me. And then I read to him [music] when God re [applause] is the [music and singing] face that I see in the mirror. The [music] one I [singing] want others to see. You [music] are showing [singing] the way that I walk in my life. The love [music and singing] that you've given to me. My heart desires [music and singing] to be like you. In all that [music and singing] I do, all I am. Do they [music and singing] see Jesus in me? Do [music] they [singing] recognize your face? Do [music] I communicate [singing] your love and your [music] grace? Do I [singing] reflect who [music] you are in the [singing] way I choose to be? Do [music] they see Jesus Jesus [singing and music] in me? [music] Well, it's amazing that you'd ever use me, but use me the [singing] way [music] you will. Help me to hold out a heart [music] of compassionate grace, a heart that [music] your spirit [singing] fills. May I [music] show forgiveness and mercy the [music] same way you've shown [singing] it to me? Do they [music and singing] see Jesus in me? Do they [singing] recognize [music] your face? Do [singing] I communicate your [music] love and your grace? [music] Do I reflect who [music and singing] you are in the way I choose to be? Do [music] they see Jesus [singing] Jesus in me? [singing] [music] Now I want [music] to show all the world that you are the reason [music and singing] I live and breathe. Do [music] you be the one [singing] that they see when they see me? [music] Do [singing] they see Jesus in me? [music] Do they recognize your face? Do I [singing and music] communicate your love and your grace? Do [music] I [singing] reflect who you are? In the [music] way I choose to be. Do they [singing] see [music] Jesus? Jesus in me. [applause] [music] My Jesus my [music] savior. [singing] Lord, there is none like you all [singing] of my [music] days. I [singing] want to praise [music] the wonders of your might. My [music] [singing] comfort, my shelter, tower [singing] of reuge. [music] Let [singing] every breath this your prayer. All that I am never [singing] cease [music] to work. Shout to [music] him. Shout to [singing] the Lord [music] all the earth. Let us sing. [music] Power [singing] and might praise [music] the king. Mountains [singing] bow down and the sea will roar at the [music] sound of [singing] your name. [music] Oh, I sing [singing] for joy at the work [music] of your hand. Forever I love. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Forever I stand. Nothing [music and singing] compares to the pro. Little girl was [singing] lying there. Yes, he do. Little girl was lying there. People all were weeping. They just laughed at Jesus when she said she's only. &gt;&gt; When he took her by [singing] the hand, she began to [music] live again. Some begin to praise the [singing] Lord. Some [music] begin to say, [singing] "He's in [music] the house. Death has to flee. [singing] Now there is not where [music and singing] darkness used to be. Now [music and singing] there is hope. There's [music] no more doubt. Oh, praise [singing] his name. Praise in the house. Is this your story? [music] I was like that little girl [music] dead. How many thankful that touch till Jesus [music] touched [singing] this heart of mine and gave me life? [music] I am just a house of pl glory. But [music] ever since [singing] that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me for all [music] the world [singing] to see. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, now [singing] there is where darkness [music] used to be. Oh, now there is hope. Oh, there's [music and singing] no more now. Oh, praise [music] his [singing] name for He's in the house. Let's sing it one more time. He's [music] in the [singing] house. Oh, death [music] has to flee. Oh, now there is light [music] where darkness used to be. [music] Oh, now there is hope. Oh, there's [music] no more doubt. Let's praise [music] his name. He's [music] in the house. [singing] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap, an offering unto the Lord. Amen. [applause and music] It's wonderful when he's in the house. Amen. I'm just reminded of that scripture. When they heard [music] that Jesus was in the house, when it was noise that Jesus was in the house, my things started to happen and things started changing. It matters whose house he's living in. Amen. Amen. And God bless you tonight. It's good to be in the house of the [music] Lord with you and happy to be back from happy to be back from the other side of the world and uh we had a wonderful time and I bring greetings from the believers there in Poland and we were able to go and be a part of those dedication meetings and the Lord certainly blessed us and just a fine fine group of believers there and uh they appreciate it. they appreciated you uh loaning us this past weekend there to be a part of those meetings and the Lord blessed us in a a bountiful way and so Amen. It's wonderful to go but it's even wonderfully even greater to come back. So Amen. There's nothing like the presence of the Lord. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight, we look over in the book of Revelations chapter 22 and verse 17. There's many things that we could say about our experiences there in Poland and maybe the Lord will give us space at some point to tell some of those things. and just a just a wonderful time and the believers did a wonderful job with the with the church building that they have there that they created a church and we were part of that at full gospel lighthouse and just so thankful uh I was able to go and uh experience uh the concentration camp of Ashawitz there and there's nothing um easy about that but it was a great experience um it was an overwhelming experience and let me say it like that. And just to think that the same night that the same night that Israel got back into their homeland and became a nation, you your prophet was meeting an angel of the Lord. And it's a signal to us that we're we're right where we need to be at. Amen. Amen. Revelations chapter 22 and verse 17. And the spirit and the bride say come. And let him that heareth say come. and let him that is a thirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man shall add unto these words, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. And if any man shall take away from the words of this book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book. Also Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. [snorts] Certainly want to be remembering brother Matthew tonight. He he he and brother William did a phenomenal job last weekend. Just a phenomenal job. [applause] I I so proud I so proud of them and they just they just a wonder we have a wonderful team of ministry here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and he was able to minister. He actually had to go to the ER last week just in so such bad pain and and but he was able to minister through it and then um then we had quite a bit of work this past week and slinging some wheels in his back just in bad shape. So just praying the Lord touch him abundantly and and uh I believe he's more than able. I woke up this morning just uh this sermon might not be for nobody here, but I just thinking, Lord, maybe this is for somebody out there on the internet, but I I just pray that the Lord touched brother Matthew tonight, and maybe maybe the Lord just go by his way, and I know that the angel of the Lord's been known to go through some neighborhoods before, so I'm I believe you'll go by the way of Brother Matthew tonight. Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. I'm sorry for I just want to talk to you for a little bit. I missed you. So, and uh so so maybe we'll just talk a little bit to you tonight about God about what God has laid on their heart. Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13. For when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he sweared by himself saying surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise. For men verilely swear by the greater an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. There is no more argument. There is no more argument when God speaks. Wherein God willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation. Ain't it wonderful to have a strong consolation? Who hath fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us? Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast which enterth into that within the veil. Whether the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus made an high priest forever after the order of Melzdc. Let's just go to the Lord and speak to him just for a minute. Father, we love you so much, Lord. It's an honor, Lord Jesus, to be in your house and to worship, Lord, our the great I am, Lord, with brothers and sisters. Lord, we recognize, Lord Jesus, that you are here. You said in your word, where two or three are gathered, in my name, there I will be in the midst of them. And Father, we recognize, Lord Jesus, that you have come here tonight, Lord, with a great obligation, Lord Jesus, to release your word to your children's heart. And I pray, Father, that you would just move across this audience tonight in a special way, Lord Jesus. You see every one of their needs. You see see every circumstance of the life that they are in. And I pray, God, that you would just minister to them in a special way, Father. Lord, I believe that you're that kind of a God tonight that you can just go right to the very secret of our heart and minister to us on the things that we've been maybe just going over in our mind. Lord, you're that kind of a God that you're a discerner of the thoughts of our heart. So, Father, we invite you just now to minister to us. And we give you liberty in this place tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. May God bless his word. You may be seated tonight. I've had this thought that's just been reeling on my mind ever since I was able to we were able to go to brother Tim's meeting and then then as we come back home and then to be with the believers there in Poland, the this thought just kept coming to my heart. It is enough. It is enough. And and I believe that many times that when we come when it comes to our walk of life that we wonder, are we really being enough? Is is the things that I'm doing for the Lord, is it enough? I I wonder if I if I'm if I'm alone here tonight or if that's something that that you ponder sometimes. If am I am I doing enough? It is it enough? And and have I done enough? Have I have I went enough? Have I Is my worship enough? Is my faith enough? Because honestly, as Christians, our true desire is to live a life that is pleasing to him in all manners. &gt;&gt; Because we recognize as human beings that we all have limitations upon upon ourself. And we we often let oursel down. And I'd say that if we'll be real honest, we've often let God down in some senses. But you know there there is nobody there is nobody that wants to do more for Christ than a man or a woman whose heart is set on fire of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to think about that thought, is it enough? And when you hear when you hear man start saying, "Is it enough?" you'll hear it and you'll see that there's a question mark behind it when it's coming from the very mind of a man. And man is beginning to admit that he has limitations when he says is it enough or it is enough or am I doing enough? And but when it when you look at it into a divine when you look into it in the divine uh concept of the word that you'll look at it in that concept it is enough. It shows a divine finality to it. is that when God begins to declare that something it is enough, God is saying that he is marking the end of that season or his almighty power by his hand is drawing a line in it by his authority. You see man sometimes will get to that spot and say is it enough and am I doing enough? But when he gets to that position, you see, man may want to do more or man might want more time or man might want more explanations on certain matters or maybe man might want more control. But there comes a moment in in every person's walk of life and no matter the scripture or the drama that God would lay in for certain characteristics is that God will come behind it and say that the matter is completely settled. You see, there are several times or several moments throughout the scripture where God will just come in and say, "That's enough right there." And he'll stop judgment when the when the angel was when the angel was going through there. When David was when David had numbered the children of Israel to see how many he had, the angel of the Lord went through there and he he had finally come to a spot and it said, "It is enough." and he stopped the judgment of God and he come to a place and when God says it is enough it's it's bringing closure to a situation or it's the end of that person's phase or their journey of that life or or come to the end of his life and we could say it that nobody said it greater than our Lord Jesus Christ when he's hanging there on the cross and he said it is finished he was bringing a finality to the thought that all ALL THE SINS THAT HAD been laid out there for generations upon generations that God was saying it is enough. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE COULD SAY IT IS ENOUGH TO THINK THAT EVERY SIN THAT YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER AND YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER ALL THE WAY BACK THERE TO THE GARDEN OF EDEN THAT THE LORD JESUS CHRIST CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "IT IS ENOUGH." HE CAN LOOK AT HIS OWN BLOOD AS IT'S BEING SHED ON THE CROSS AND HE COULD SAT THERE AS HE'S SPEAKING IN TONGUES AND SAYS, "IT IS FINISHED." &gt;&gt; Many times when you begin to look through the scriptures, you begin to find that people get to that place and they've just had enough. They get to a place and the scriptures actually record people record where people get to a place where they're exhausted. They get to a place where they're overwhelmed. They get to a place where they're ready TO QUIT AND THROW in the towel. And when they get to a place and said, "It's enough." You see, what their enough is confessing is, "I cannot do it in my own power." &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE GOD strength becomes visible. And I thought brother Matthew JUST DID A VERY ADEQUATE JOB ABOUT SPEAKING IT LAST WEEKEND ABOUT MY STRENGTH IS MADE PERFECT IN WEAKNESS. You see, BECAUSE WHEN WE COME TO THE END OF OUR ENOUGH, IT'S OFTEN WHEN GOD BEGINS TO OPEN UP A DOOR OF TRANSITION OR IT'S A NEW BEGINNING BECAUSE WE DON'T REALIZE THAT WHEN WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF OUR ROPE AND WE'RE AT THE END OF THE LINE AND WE'RE SAID, "THAT'S ENOUGH. I CAN'T GO NO MORE." THAT'S WHEN GOD'S GETTING READY TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You know, THE PROPHET ELIJAH ONE TIME GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE'D DONE BATTLED EVERY EVERY PSYCHOLOGY DEVIL, every intellectual devil. He'd been up there on a mountain. He just fought 450 prophets up there of bail. And he'd been up there battling AGAINST THEM. AND HE GOT WORN OUT. HE'D BEEN BATTLING AGAINST AHAB AND JEZEBEL. AND I'LL BE HONEST, Elijah was at a place where the scripture said THAT HE WAS SUICIDAL. HE GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE WAS DONE. HE, THE BIBLE DECLARES THAT ELIJAH SAID, "IT IS ENOUGH." ELIJAH WAS SAYING, "I HAVE RAN MY RACE. I HAVE FINISHED MY COURSE. I'M DONE. I CAN'T HANDLE IT NO MORE. TAKE MY LIFE AWAY." YOU SEE, WHEN YOU COME TO THIS PLACE OF IT IS ENOUGH. IT IS SIGNALING A TRANSITION. AND WHEN ELIJAH SAYS THIS, GOD WAS NOT REJECTING HIM. HALLELUJAH. BUT GOD WAS PREPARING HIM FOR THE NEXT STEP OF HIS MINISTRY. HALLELUJAH. [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET TO A PLACE WHEN YOU SAY, "Is it enough? It is enough. Is it?" You don't realize. But a double portion is getting ready to come. &gt;&gt; When you get TO A PLACE, CAN I CAN I DO A LITTLE BIT MORE? CAN I CAN I GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE? He gets to this spot and he gets to a place a lot of humans get to I don't know about you womans, but a lot of us humans get to that place where we just got to lay up underneath a juniper tree. He He's ready to die. He's ready to give it all up. But it was when he got to it is enough. IT'S THAT WHEN GOD STEPS IN AND STARTED SUPERNATURALLY FEEDING HIM AND LEADS HIM UP THERE TO HOREB. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. HE LEADS HIM UP THERE TO HOREB AND A STILL SMALL VOICE STARTS TALKING TO HIM AND GIVES HIM AN ASSIGNMENT THAT THE GREATER PART OF HIS MINISTRY WAS GETTING BE READY TO BE TRANSFERRED. &gt;&gt; He lines it out of exactly how things are going to be. You sisters, I've watched I've watched my wife and my mom do this many times. You sisters, you get to a place and you're wanting to provide for your husband that's been out working. He's been bringing home. He's been bringing home the bacon and you want to provide something very special for him. And I've heard this often times sitting around a dinner table and you sisters sometimes think my just it just ain't enough, you know. And I I I don't know. I don't know if this will satisfy my husband, but I've sure put a lot into it. You I I've heard this now. I I my sourdough didn't just turn out like it did last time. You know, my gravy didn't turn out like it did last time. you know, I I just something wasn't right. My tiny was the world's worst. She'd sit there and she'd say, "Now, that gravy, it ain't it ain't as good as I like, and it would be the best gravy you ever ate in your life." You sisters, you know what I'm talking about. You You've worked hard. You want to do something nice for your husband. You've been out there working and doing what a man should do, getting out working, and you want to provide him a nice meal, and you're you're worried, is it enough? Is it going to satisfy him? and you feed him and my he sits there and he's chowing down and he's just enjoying the best beans and ters and some of the best meal he's ever eaten. He has to push himself back away from the table to give his midriff a little bit of area so that it could breathe just a little extra. &gt;&gt; When he DOES THAT, IT'S A sign he's satisfied. &gt;&gt; It's enough. It shows THAT WHEN A MAN PUSHES away from the table, I HAVE GOT MY FIELD. THAT I'M SATISFIED WITH YOUR MEAL. AND YOU SITTING THERE THINKING, I didn't I didn't do this right. I didn't PUT ENOUGH SALT IN. I DIDN'T add enough of this in there. I SHOULD HAVE ADDED THAT. I forgot this and I forgot that. But your husband sitting THERE, MINE, THAT'S THE BEST THING THAT YOU EVER MAKE. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW THAT I FIND OUT ABOUT HUMANITY THAT WE'LL OFTEN GET TO THAT POSITION where we think that what we've got to offer is not enough for our Lord Jesus Christ. BUT WHAT I FOUND OUT ABOUT OUR LORD IS WHEN WE THINK it ain't enough, it's more than enough. He takes TWO LITTLE FISHES AND FIVE LOAVES of bread. He can take a little bitty meal and a little bit of a barrel. He can take 300 men and put them IN GIDEON'S ARMY. AND HE CAN STRIKE DOWN 122,000 MIDIANITES. WHEN YOU DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH, IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH. [screaming] WHEN GOD TOUCHES IT, &gt;&gt; I SAY THIS, THIS MESSAGE IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I don't HAVE TO WORRY IF I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE OR NOT. IT'S ENOUGH TO PUT ME IN A RAPTURE, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It is [applause] enough. &gt;&gt; ANOTHER PROPHET SAID IN CONFIRMATION AND EVIDENCE, "WHEN A man buys a car, he must have a deed to that car. And though he HAS NOT THE CAR SITTING in his garage, HALLELUJAH." IF HE HAS A DEED, IT'S A CONFIRMATION TO HIM THAT HE OWNS THAT CAR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE HE HAS A DEED OR THE TITLE. AND THEN IF WE BOUGHT A PIECE OF GROUND, THOUGH WE never seen the ground or know nothing about the ground, YET WE HAVE AN ABSTRACT DEED TO THAT GROUND. IT BELONGS to us. &gt;&gt; WHETHER WE HAVE SEEN IT OR NOT. HALLELUJAH. IT STILL BELONGS TO US. THE CAR BELONGS TO US. WHETHER WE SEEN IT OR NOT, WE HAVE A TITLE GIVEN TO US AND WE HOLD IT. HALLELUJAH. We hold it in our possession and that title shows. &gt;&gt; IT SHOWS THAT WE OWN THE CAR. &gt;&gt; THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SHOWS THAT WE OWN THE PROPERTY. THE ABSTRACT IS THE PROOF. NOW, I've never had this happen to me, but I don't I don't believe it's too far out that it could happen to me. BUT IF I I get a letter in the in the mail that one of my great great UNCLES THAT WAS A very wealthy man died and he heard about a little bitty red-headed preacher and he wanted to leave him some money. And I get this paper in there and it says I own all this and I don't know about any of them are rich uncles but if any of them out there now's a good time. is as good a time as any. But if I if that's oh this uncle decided he wanted to leave me everything that he had and HAD ALL THESE THOUSANDS OF ACRES that he was going to leave to my name and I got this legal certification saying that this PIECE OF PROPERTY IS OWNED BY ANDREW SPITRA. It was left and it was read, HALLELUJAH, BY THE TESTATOR THAT THIS MAN LEFT YOU THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY. NOW, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK I'D be like some Christians that stand out there say, "You know what? I don't know WHETHER THIS IS RIGHT OR NOT. I really don't know if I got an uncle like that. I really don't know if somebody would love me that or think that much about me that he would leave me all of this. I don't believe I'd be that side of Christianity because I believe that I came from the south side OF HEAVEN. BUT I BELIEVE THIS THAT IF I GOT THAT LETTER IN THE MAIL, I'D BE LIKE I'D BE LIKE [screaming] JOB AND I'D START SHOUTING ALL AROUND IT BECAUSE I COULD SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I NEVER SEEN THAT PROPERTY, BUT THAT DEED RIGHT THERE SHOWS THAT I GOT A RICH UNCLE THAT THOUGHT THAT THOMAS, I HOPE it's you, buddy. I pray God it's you." HALLELUJAH. MAYBE MY UNCLE MARK WILL LEAVE ME SOMETHING like that ONE DAY. WHETHER I EVER SEEN IT OR NOT, BECAUSE THAT DEED SHOWS THAT IT'S MINE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WELL, you can dance all about it you want to. Or you can say, "Well, I don't know whether it's right or not, but as for me in my house, &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME TO MOVE. I GOT SOME NEW LAND." WELL, THAT'S THE WAY THAT SOME CHRISTIANS NEED TO DO. THEY NEED TO PICK UP WHERE THEY'RE LIVING IN. IN A SPOT OF DOUBT, IN A SPOT OF CONFUSION, IN A SPOT WHERE THE BLOOD DOESN'T WORK NO MORE. IN A SPOT WHERE HEALING DOESN'T EXIST NO MORE AND TAKE UP RESIDENCE IN A NEW LAND. &gt;&gt; NOW, I ain't got no rich uncles. I guarantee it. [panting] But I do have a Princess Diana that was in my genealogy. BUT MAYBE SOMETHING FROM HER GOT PASSED OUT. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'LL HAPPEN YET OR NOT, but this I do know. &gt;&gt; I got everything I want and everything I'll ever need. ANYTHING I COULD EVER ASK FOR. ANYTHING THAT'S too big, I CAN STILL ASK FOR IT. IF IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE TOO SMALL, I CAN ASK FOR IT. WILL YOU SAY, "BROTHER ANDREW, IS IT ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY NEEDS?" IT is enough. &gt;&gt; I love what Brother Brandham is doing here. He is showing us and he is drawing a line between seeing and owning BECAUSE FAITH POSSESSES WHAT THE EYE HAS NOT YET SEEN. BECAUSE FAITH HOLDS A PART OF THAT TITLE DEED OF GOD'S PROMISES. YOU SEE, WE BEGIN SO MANY TIMES as Christianity, we begin to look for improvement instead of believing. &gt;&gt; You know what? I I I've been sick for this like a long time now. I I just be honest with you. And I don't know whether God's got the power or not. When that person starts feeling a little bit better, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE GOD'S MAYBE GOD'S WORD DOES WORK AND THEY START BUILDING up a little bit OF FAITH AND THEY START THINKING, you know what? Hey, God is God is still God. He's still a good God. But as a title deed believer, hallelujah, FAITH DOESN'T LOOK OUT THERE to check in THE GARAGE AND SEE WHETHER THE CAR'S THERE OR NOT. FAITH CHECKS THE TITLE. FAITH REJOICES BEFORE THE MERCEDES GETS IN THE GARAGE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, I SAY IT'S WORTH BELIEVING. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my God owns a cattle on a thousand hills. &gt;&gt; I tell you, my God can put a Cadillac in YOUR GARAGE BEFORE NIGHT IS OVER IF YOU HAD NEED OF IT. &gt;&gt; I remember Brother Ron was preaching along the line like that one time down in South Carolina. He's preaching about God. God could give you a million dollars in in a checkbook by the end of this service. He's a black sister sitting back there. She said, "SURELY WANT TO DO IT AGAIN, LORD." &gt;&gt; I think we need to get that kind of faith. &gt;&gt; AND WE NEED TO START TALKING IT UNTIL IT BECOMES MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; WELL, I DON'T NEED A MILLION DOLLARS. I DON'T NEED $10 MILLION. YOU SAY, "WELL, it sure would help me." Let me tell you, if you can't make it with what you got, you'll never make it. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you, if you have need OF IT, MY FATHER WILL PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS BEFORE YOU CAN EVER think of it. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE WITH ALL OF MY HEART [screaming] THAT GOD HAS GOT A PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE ability &gt;&gt; to speak. &gt;&gt; I'll just be real honest. I don't need a Ferrari. I think I'd look good in that thing. I sure like to try it out one time. I really don't think I need that. I really don't. But I would enjoy it. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to lie. I'd enjoy that. I tell you what I do need. I need to preach this message &gt;&gt; to every prodal &gt;&gt; that I've ever cared for and you ever cared for. Come on. &gt;&gt; I need to preach it. That's what I need. I need to preach faith until it gets into a people's hearts. I NEED TO PREACH HEALING UNTIL PEOPLE START BELIEVING IT. THAT'S WHAT I NEED. AND WHEN I START WORKING ACCORDING TO REVELATIONS 19, THAT THESE ARE THE TRUE SAYINGS OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT I NEED. I DON'T NEED A FERRARI. I DON'T NEED A LAMBORGHINI. BUT WHAT [screaming] I DO need &gt;&gt; is every hoof. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you see all them things out there. You see it. You see every need that we got. What do you think? The message is enough. &gt;&gt; I I tell you one thing. You ain't got to change nothing about this message. It'll work. I tell you what, it'll work in Belgium. It'll work in New Zealand. It'll work in Poland. It'll work in France. IT'LL WORK IN ZIMBABWE. IT'LL WORK IN AFRICA. IT'LL WORK IN IT'LL WORK IN THE DARKENED JUNGLES OF OVERCROSSED SEAS. THIS MESSAGE WILL PUT A HEART ON FIRE FOR THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. HELL HAS GOT TO RESPECT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HAIL'S GOT WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO RESPECT IT OR NOT, HAIL'S GOT TO RESPECT IT. AND WHEN SATAN BEGINS TO CHALLENGE YOUR HEALING OR YOUR SALVATION OR YOUR DELIVERANCE OR YOUR PEACE, you point him back to that title. Don't point him to your circumstances. Don't point him to your symptoms. YOU POINT HIM RIGHT BACK TO THAT TITLE DEED. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SAYS THERE IS NOTHING AGAINST YOUR PROPERTY. THAT ABSTRACT TITLE DEED SAYS ALL THE PAST claims are cleared off. There ain't no leans. There ain't NO DEBTS. THERE AIN'T NO LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN. &gt;&gt; SO IN CHRIST, YOUR PAST IS ERADICATED. SATAN'S CLAIMS ARE IN VOID AND INADEQUATE. &gt;&gt; The blood has removed every lean. &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you as a point. Only as a point. I was not born to be somebody that is a renter. And I'm not saying I know that people have different circumstances where they have to rent. Some people find that to be the very best of their life, but I was that was not me. And I'm not I'm only saying this for a point. I'm only saying this for a point. Promise you I was not born to be a renter because I want to leave something to my family. I believe that's what Proverbs tells us that we ought to raise up something to leave a lineage to our children. &gt;&gt; They're going to be responsible for what they got to do. &gt;&gt; But I was not born to be a renter. So let me say it to you like this so that you'll get what I'm saying. You are not renting forgiveness. &gt;&gt; You are not renting forgiveness. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING? WHEN YOU'RE a renter, YOU PAY ONE TIME AND YOU GOT TO PAY AGAIN. And when you get to the end of the road, you still got to rent because you'll never own it. But if YOU ARE PAYING IT DOWN, IF YOU'RE PAYING IT DOWN AND YOU GOT ALL OF THAT BUILT UP AND YOU GOT A FINALITY TO IT AND THE DEED IS THERE, IT SAYS IT'S PAID OFF. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE NOT RENTING IT. YOU OWN FORGIVENESS. &gt;&gt; YOU own forgiveness. LOOK AT THE DEVIL IN YOUR LIFE AND SAID, "MY GOD OWNS FORGIVENESS." &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what faith does. Faith will begin to laugh. It will laugh at the miracle being in absence. ARE YOU WITH ME? &gt;&gt; ISAAC MEANS LAUGHTER. I SAY ABRAHAM, I SAY SARAH, YOU MIGHT BE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OLDER, BUT IT'S A TIME TO TURN TO LAUGHING. &gt;&gt; IT'S A time when you start laughing about it. Because in the natural, in the natural, the car ain't in the garage. But in the supernatural, no manifestation means it's already yours. What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm saying manifestation is just late for the party. Are you with me? I say this, if you're a real title deed believer, it is enough BECAUSE YOUR OWNERSHIP HAS ALREADY ARRIVED the very second that YOU RECEIVE THE WORD. WHEN ABRAHAM IS SAYING, SITTING THERE IN GENESIS 15, HE SAID, "NOW look here. GOD, ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO CHILDLESS, SEEING THAT THE ONLY heir in my house is Eleazar OF DAMASCUS? THERE'S PEOPLE LAUGHING AT ME. THEY'RE CALLING ME THE FATHER of nations, and I don't even have an heir in my own house." AND GOD SPEAKS BACK TO HIM. BOY, don't worry. THAT SHALL NOT BE THINE HEIR. BUT I WANT YOU TO DO THIS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO CHILDLESS, BUT I WANT YOU TO LOOK UP TOWARDS THE HEAVENS. And I want you to see if you can tell me if that's enough. TELL ME IF THAT'S ENOUGH. BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE THAN STARS IN HEAVEN. THEY'LL BE GREATER [screaming] THAN THE SAND THAT IS UPON THE SHORE. YOU SEE, GOD NEVER SAID WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN, BUT HE SAID IT WOULD HAPPEN. HE SAID, "LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY SHALL RECOVER." YOU SAY, "BROTHER, does it work?" I said, "It is enough." &gt;&gt; THE ODDS MIGHT BE STACKED UP AGAINST YOU, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; But God's word is enough. GOD'S PLAN CANNOT GO DOWN DEFEATED. WHEN GOD WAS TESTING ABRAHAM, HE SENT HIM THROUGH THAT BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT ABRAHAM HAD FAITH IN WHAT HE COULD NOT SEE. I'm trying to get this to a place. I want this to land. It is enough. Because Satan will often tack you where you're looking at. We take that quote from confirmation and evidence and he will always Satan will always point you to an empty garage or he'll point you to an empty field that your name ain't on or he'll point you to delays in God's promises but faith will stand there. I love how brother Burnham says that. He says he's got hair on his chest and lets out a big old scream like a bobcat or a panther. You see, faith refuses to measure the natural by what you see. Faith is saying, you know what? I got this deed in my hand. God said it. That's final. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing what I'm saying to you? &gt;&gt; I'm saying talk to your doubt. I'm saying talk to your fear. I'm saying talk TO YOUR ANXIETY. I'M SAYING talk to the pain of your past. I'm saying talk to the stigmas. I'M SAYING TALK TO EVERY devil that's got a lying tongue. I say talk to that thing and show HIM THE BLOOD AND SAY IT is enough. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I use this. If you listen to Louisiana heard this, but let me say this. I got a wonderful mama down there and I was constantly going to her. I was constantly going to her saying, "Mom, I want to do this. I want to do this. I want to do this." And she said, "Drew, get out of here." I ain't going to tell you everything that happened, but she said, "Drew, get out of here." And I bring her the petition again. I say this, "Mom, I want to go do this. I want to go throw mud pies at the house." She said, "Get out of here. I want to go do this. I want to go chase cows. I want to go to cow tipping. I want to go do this. I want to go try." I'm not going to say everything. But anyways, my mama had finally got TO A SPOT. SAID, "DREW, THAT'S ENOUGH." &gt;&gt; I knew what she meant right there. Boy, you better get to your room. The belt's clicking. She done had enough. WELL, IT'S TIME NOW THAT YOU LOOK AT THE DEVIL. You look to the complexes. You look to the fear. YOU LOOK TO THE THINGS IN YOUR PAST AND SAY, "SATAN, THAT'S ENOUGH." &gt;&gt; SATAN IS LIKE A DOG ON A CHAIN. HE CAN ONLY GO SO FAR. BUT GOD'S WORD HAS NO LIMITATIONS ON IT. [applause] What are you saying? I'm saying this message is enough. &gt;&gt; It's enough to put you in a body change. IT'S ENOUGH TO PUT YOU IN A RAPTURE. IT'S ENOUGH TO HEAL YOUR BODY. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S ENOUGH. IT'LL CHANGE YOUR VISION. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOUR NEW IDENTITY HAS TRANSFORMED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; You remember, I want to just go back. You remember in Genesis chapter 37, there's a little boy by the name of Joseph. He's a gifted boy. He was not set up by man. He was gifted by Almighty God. You start studying in Genesis 37 that Joseph has a dream and he starts talking about these these sheav falling down before him and bowing down before Joseph. It showed that it was his brethren bowing down, the sun and the moon and the stars and all of them bowing down before him. And even his father that was supposed to be a prince of power actually began to question Joseph's supernatural gift that he had in his life. You begin to look at Joseph's story, how that everything had transpired in his life, and it looked, if you're looking at the vision in the carnal realm, the vision looked like it was wrong. Joseph's path doesn't get better, but it gets worse. He goes from a pit to slave CHAINS TO PIPER'S HOUSE TO FALSE accusations to prison. And he goes to a spot that he has completely forgotten about. I wonder, have you ever got there? &gt;&gt; I wonder, have you got to that bad of a position where people have forgot you? Nobody's praying for me. My name's been on that prayer list for three weeks now, and I ain't got no better. I wonder if anybody really even cares for me. I wonder if they even love me. It does not get better for Joseph. It gets worse. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. When you get to the end of your enough, that's when transition happens. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you're at the end of your rope right now and you don't know what to do, get ready. &gt;&gt; GENESIS 45 AND 25. NOW, I got three scriptures right here that I could preach three months on. And they verse 25. And they went out when his brothers come to him and they spent some time with him and they start recognizing this ain't just somebody. This is my brother. This is Joseph. The one that we The one that we lied about. The one that we killed. We tried to kill his testimony. This is him. The one we threw in A PIT. THE ONE WE LIED TO OUR DADDY ABOUT. THE ONE THIS ONE. THAT'S MY BROTHER. And they turned back. And they went out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, and told him, saying, JOSEPH IS YET ALIVE, AND HE IS GOVERNOR over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart failed, for he believed them not. &gt;&gt; All right now. &gt;&gt; All right. Now y'all got y'all shouting shoes on. And they told him all the words of Joseph, WHICH HE HAD SAID UNTO THEM. AND WHEN HE SAW THE WAGONS WHICH JOSEPH HAD SENT TO CARRY HIM, THE SPIRIT OF JACOB THEIR FATHER REVIVED. [screaming] NOW WATCH THIS. AND ISRAEL SAID, "IT IS ENOUGH." NOTICE WHEN HE SAW THAT VISION OF GENESIS 37 OF ALL OF THOSE THINGS BOWING DOWN, &gt;&gt; WHAT DID IT DO TO JACOB? IT IMMEDIATELY REVELATION CHANGED HIS IDENTITY THAT HE DIDN'T SPEAK LIKE JACOB. ISRAEL said &gt;&gt; it is enough. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? I'm talking about this is that that revelation revived his identity and when you start seeing there is truth in the vision. Are you hearing me? When you start seeing there's truth IN CALVARY, WHEN YOU START SEEING THERE'S TRUTH, WHAT IS IT? THIS MOMENT WHEN HE SAW THE WAGONS THAT WAS GOING TO CARRY HIM BACK TO HIS JOSEPH. HALLELUJAH. IT WAS PROOF THAT THE VISION THAT JOSEPH [screaming] HAD WAS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I've done seen the wagons of the Holy Spirit show up here. &gt;&gt; I DONE SEEN THE WAGONS OF MY LORD JESUS SHOW UP HERE. BUT I'VE BEEN MAKING MYSELF READY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'VE BEEN MAKING MYSELF READY. I'VE BEEN DRESSING MYSELF IN THE UNFAILING BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. IT IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. There's going to be people They turned on that man that'll never get their wagon. But the prophet said that our horses are hooked up to the bushes. The same ones that came for Elijah when he got to his enough and he stepped over Jordan and all of a sudden departed and a chariot of fire picked him up. The prophet said that them horses are hooked up for in the bushes for you. &gt;&gt; Let me SAY WHEN I SAW THIS PROPHET'S VISION, I COULD SAY IT IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, GOD WILL PLACE a limit on your enemy. &gt;&gt; God will place a limit on your enemy and YOU'LL THINK THEY'RE STILL ATTACKING ME. BUT I'LL SAY THAT IT IS ENOUGH IS A PROTECTIVE BOUNDARY. WHEN ABRAHAM IS GETTING TO THE TRIAL OF HIS LIFE, HE'S DONE WATCH ISAAC RAISE UP AND BE A YOUNG BOY, BUT GOD IS COMMANDING HIM TO TAKE HIS SON, HIS ONLY SON, &gt;&gt; and sacrifice him. When Abraham got to this position that I trust you, no matter what you say, you were God enough to change my body. You're God enough to bring him back from the dead as the Lord God. give the Lord God taketh away and it's about the time he's about to kill it. God says, "Oh, that's enough. THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU AIN'T GOT TO GO NO MORE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO STRIVE NO MORE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TRY NO MORE BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN YOUR FAITH." THAT YOUR FAITH IN THIS MESSAGE IS ENOUGH THAT THOUGH MEN TRY TO KILL YOU, THAT THOUGH MEN TRY TO SLAY YOU, &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LIKE IN JOB'S TRIAL, SATAN COULD ONLY GO SO FAR. But God says that's enough. &gt;&gt; That's enough. When Abraham Hallelujah. When Abraham got to his position, he didn't know what to do. My body's done changed. I got to smoking his hottest wife in all of Egypt. And I'm about to walk down in here with her. And I know that they're going to say some things about her. They're going to want her now. Look here, honey. You tell them that you're my sister. You tell them. And the king sees her. Now, what? Now, now, you could not know this without the revelation of the seven seals being open. &gt;&gt; But he looks out there. That king is lusting after a 90 year old woman. Now, I think my grandma's a beautiful woman, but I highly doubt I highly doubt that any of these teenage boys are going to be lusted. And I I don't mean nothing no offense, but you let God do what he did to Sarah, to my grandma, &gt;&gt; brother home be rising back up again. SO, SOMETHING HAD TO CHANGE. That had probably true a whole lot of saying right there. That real inspiration. I hear you. I hear you talking to me. I hear. He says, "That's enough." [applause] But Abraham had got to a position. He got to a position he didn't know what to do with this. This king is taking my wife. This king's getting ready to take her and make her his bride. But God was not willing that his bride be manhandled. So he extracted her from every denomination. &gt;&gt; And he stopped that king right in his track. Said, "That's enough. You can't have her. You redeem that man, his bride. You give her back. I say this to you that God is speaking in this generation. Take your hands off of my bride. Redeem her back. Give her back. Give her back. Take your dirty hands off of her, Satan. What was it when William Brandham is standing there in the breach between the CHURCH AGES AND THE SEVEN SEALS? HE'S STANDING THERE AND SAYING, "ONLY THE LAMB COULD BREAK THESE SEALS." HE SAID, "LET HIM COME. LET HIM COME OR FOREVER HOLD HIS PEACE." AND THE LAMB WAS INVITED. YOU SAY, "WELL, DID THE LAMB SHOW UP, BROTHER ANDREW? WAS THE SEVEN SEALS BROKE?" THEN THE LAMB SHOWED UP. IT WAS NOT A HOOF LAMB, BUT THE LAMB OF ALMIGHTY GOD &gt;&gt; SAID THAT IN BLESSING I WILL BLESS THEE, AND IN MULTIPLYING I WILL MULTIPLY THEE. WHEN YOU got to the end of your enough, that's when God became Jehovah &gt;&gt; Gyra. He looked at Abraham said, "Your faith and my word is enough to bless you and to bless all of your children for every generation." Romans 8:28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the caught according to his purpose. For whom he did for know, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn amongst many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified. AND WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, them he also glorified. It means he raised them to a heavenly dignity. For what shall we then say to these things? If Elohim be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us, HOW SHALL HE NOT WITH HIM ALSO FREELY give us all things? WHO SHALL LAY ANYTHING to the charge of God's elect? It is it is IT IS GOD &gt;&gt; THAT JUSTIFYTH. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, you have no idea what Sister Rebecca did. You have no idea what her father did. You have no idea what her grandfather did. I don't need to know. Neither do I care. &gt;&gt; IT IS GOD that justifith. &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY SAY IT WITH ME. IT IS GOD THAT JUSTIFYTH. Who is he? Oh, let's call that booger out. WHO IS HE THAT CONDEMNTH? IT IS CHRIST THAT DIED. YAY, RATHER IS RISEN AGAIN, WHO IS EVEN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD, WHO ALSO MAKETH INTERCESSION FOR US. WHO SHALL SEPARATE US? NOW NAME THAT BOOGER. Name every lying devil. Name every ugly spirit THAT YOU GOT. WHO SHALL SEPARATE US FROM THE LOVE OF GOD? SHALL TRIBULATION? SHOUT DISTRESS OR PERSECUTION OR FAMINE OR NAKEDNESS OR PERIL OR SWORD. AS IT IS WRITTEN, FOR THY SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL THE DAY LONG. WE ARE accounted as sheep for slaughter. Nay, in all these things. &gt;&gt; Yeah, line them boogers up. &gt;&gt; Yet in all OF THESE THINGS, LINE THEM DEVILS UP. WE ARE MORE THAN CONQUERORS. WHEN YOU LOOK THAT UP IN THE GREEK, IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE A SUPER CONQUEROR. NOT ONLY CAN YOU CONQUER, BUT YOU'RE A MAGNIFIED CONQUEROR THROUGH Christ &gt;&gt; that loved us. &gt;&gt; You remember when that that soldier boy came to Abraham Lincoln and he came to him and told him about this man that had done this wrong thing and they're going to kill him before the guards and all these things. He didn't mean to do it. He's a good man. He was just in it wrong. And Abraham Lincoln said, "You take this and tell him that he's pardoned." And when he went to that man's prison door, he told him said, "Look here. I got a note from Mr. Lincoln said, "You're absolutely free. You're absolutely free. All you got to do is walk out of here." He said, "Get out here." Abraham Lincoln wouldn't sign on a piece of paper LIKE THAT. IT HAD SOME LETTERHEAD to it. THIS IS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S WORD. And they shot and killed that man. You remember what the law said when they tried that court said that a pardon is only a pardon is if it's accepted as a pardon. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that God gives us all things and he gives us a pardon. HE SAID, "BUT it isn't only just that read it. It doesn't mean that you're pardoned. It means that YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT IT AS YOUR PARDON." THAT GOD GAVE HIS SON TO DIE in yourstead. &gt;&gt; That's a pardon. I remember brother Wayne was preaching on the bride's redemptive rights one time and he got talking about Eve walking out and the bride walking in. He said, you know, he said, we didn't have nothing to do with losing our rights and he said, we ain't got nothing to do with bringing them back in. &gt;&gt; We ain't got nothing to do with buying them back. I ain't counting on me. &gt;&gt; I'm counting on him. &gt;&gt; All we got to do is accept it. Now, I'm trying to tell you something. I'm trying to tell you something. You might think I'm preaching about sin, but I'm really talking about this message. It's enough. &gt;&gt; And when you start operating from that position, &gt;&gt; it's enough. You know, Brother Roy Borders was Brother Brandham's uh campaign manager at one point and Brother Brandham came to him and he when he was offering him the job to be the campaign manager, he come to him. He said, "Now look, Brother Roy," he said, "I need I got a position. I need you. I'm asking, would you consider being my campaign manager?" Brother Roy said it like this. He said, "You know," he said, "When I" He said, "When I heard about that," he said, "It excited my heart." He said, "Because I was thinking, I'm going to get to sit there where all them preachers are. I'll get be in this place." And brother Mar said, "You don't have to get back to me right now. You just wait a minute. Just just wait." So, brother brother Roy goes up there to his hotel room and he gets there and he starts thinking all the things I've done, all the problems I got in my past, all the all these things. I can't do that job. I can't do that. And he Brother Brandham comes, knocks on his door, and he takes him for a little drive. Comes to his door, takes him out, goes out through there, and he's just driving. Said, "Brother Brandon's just happy as lark." He said, "What about that job, Brother Roy?" He said, "Brother Brandon," he said, "I can't take that job. I can't take I got all them things in my past." Brother Brandham rolled over said, "Brother Roy, them things are in the sea of God's forgetfulness." He said, "Not only can I tell you that," he said, "The reason why I know that," he said, "Because I don't see your sin." &gt;&gt; A prophet couldn't see the things that a man was battling with. &gt;&gt; So what ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING THE BLOOD IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I SAYING? IN EXODUS 12, WHEN IT WAS A TIME TO SLAY the lamb, when it come where you had to bring him in and THEY HAD TO BRING IT IN AND SLAY THE LAMB, YOU HAD TO KILL THE LAMB. YOU HAD TO SLAY THE LAMB. YOU HAD TO TAKE IT FOR YOUR HOUSE. DADDY'S, THIS IS YOUR JOB. &gt;&gt; It's your job to PLAY THIS MESSAGE. IT'S YOUR JOB TO APPLY THE TOKEN. IT'S YOUR JOB. &gt;&gt; This lamb had to be perfect. Remember when the prophet said when he's preaching a token, he said that death angel started coming around there. He said, "That little boy, that was the firstborn son said, ' Daddy, are you sure that monster ain't coming in here?" He said, 'Oh yeah. He said, 'You see this son?" He said, "You see the blood on this door?" He said, "That monster can't get in here." You see, IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO have the lamb on the inside of your house. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO TIE UP THE LAMB. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE IT AT YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO OVER TO BROTHER ANDREW and brother Ron's HOUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. YOU GOT TO KILL THE LAMB. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO KILL THE LAMB AND PUT THE TOKEN OVER YOUR DOOR. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M SAYING REVELATION 10 people start eating the book. &gt;&gt; I can say this. If you don't IF YOU DON'T START EATING THIS LAMB, THEN THAT MONSTER IS GOING TO COME BY YOUR HOUSE. AND YOU THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE CNN AND FOX NEWS IS BAD. When you start listening to a prophet start preaching and knoweth it not and THEM GREAT BIG OLD MONSTERS COME OUT IN THE TRIBULATION, &gt;&gt; YOU BETTER BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; When things that Hollywood can't even come up with, &gt;&gt; you better pray. Daddies, you better pray. You better pray that you believed it. You better pray when them things start coming and hunting you down. Daddy, can that thing get me? Oh no. Oh no. You see, this ain't some tape hanging over your door. Hallelujah. This ain't some tape hanging over your door. This is the blood YOU CAN TAKE TAPE OFF. IT'LL RIP OFF OF THERE, BUT THE BLOOD WON'T COME OFF. &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD WON'T COME [screaming] OFF. THAT BLOOD IS THERE. AND DON'T YOU WORRY, JUNIOR. THAT BLOOD SAYS YOU'RE GOING OUT OF HERE WITH ME. I tell you what it's time to do. It's time to put your staff in your hand and put your shoes ON YOUR FEET AND START GETTING READY FOR MARCHING ORDERS CUZ WE'RE GOING DOWN TO JERICHO TO TAKE OVER. [applause] Let's say Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother said in the resurrection of Jerus's daughter, he said, "Way back up on that hill." He said, "I could see a little woman doing her knitting." He said, "She spent all of her money for at the doctors. They couldn't do her no good. She had a blood issue for several years. And she looked down and she said, "Isn't it strange? I was just dreaming about him last night." Hallelujah. Perhaps. And I believe if I could only get to that man and touch his garments, I would have to get no prayer line. He'd just turn around and tell me it was over. If I could just get close enough to him, that's the way to do it. That's who did. If I could just get close enough to him, that's all I need. He said, 'Well, I I see her walk down here and there stands her pastor and she looks up and says, "Where are you going?" AND I SUPPOSE THEN GOING DOWN TO THAT MEETING, "WELL, I want I want to let you know this. You know what the orders are around here, any impersonation, any person that associates with that tribe, they're giving the letter said, "You can just have it." And here she goes on RIGHT ON DOWN. AND SHE SAID SHE HAD TO GET TO JESUS. AND AS SOON AS SHE GOT THERE, I CAN SEE HER STANDING before a big bunch. Look down there, say, "Well, I'm surprised at you." A WOMAN WITH THE DOCTORS HAVE TURNED DOWN AND CAN'T DO nothing for her. And you had a woman with that kind of reputation. You got as good a woman, the reputation and prestige that you got amongst the people. And here you are associating yourself with that bunch of holy rollers. Brother Chris, I can't believe you're actually down there with them. the very audacity that she would show up to hang out with them kind of people. And they said, "The days of miracles has passed." And she looked back and said, I CAN HEAR THE PROPHET SAID, I can hear her TURN AROUND SAID, "IT MIGHT BE FOR YOU, BUT NOT FOR ME. &gt;&gt; IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME. IT IS." FOR SOME OF YOU THAT SAY, "THE BLOOD HAS NO LONGER GOT ITS POWER, BUT FOR ME, It is enough. &gt;&gt; When them slaves are climbing that hill some 200 years ago and they was climbing, it wasn't 200 years ago, was it? They was climbing that hill and they was going up there and they knew that there was a man [gasps] that had enough words that had enough power behind his words. And they started climbing that hill and they started going up there and said, "You know what? When the sun rises, we're free. We're free. We're free." Let me tell you church, it's the rising of the sun. It is enough. THEY HAD ENOUGH ABILITY AND ENOUGH POWER TO TRUST A MAN'S WORDS. &gt;&gt; They had that kind of capability to take a man's word to walk out of the slave master's house saying, "No, you're not going to beat me no more. You can put that whip down cuz I got a mighty man in this nation. I got a mighty man in this nation says you can't whip me no more. You may have whipped me before but you can't whip me now. You may have beat me before but you can't whip me now. You might have abused me and told me to go out there and work before but you can't do it now because there was a man that said on this day I AM FREE. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID THIS MESSAGE SAY TO THE CHURCH IN THIS GENERATION? IT IS AN INVISIBLE UNION BETWEEN THE BRIDE AND THE BRIDEGROOM. [screaming] AND NOT ONLY DID A MAN SAY IT, BUT THE lamb &gt;&gt; said it is enough. &gt;&gt; What are you trusting, brother Andrew? &gt;&gt; I'm not trusting the fleshly man, William Brandham. But I am trusting Revelations 10:1. &gt;&gt; I AM FULLY TRUSTING IN HIM. &gt;&gt; I AM FULLY TRUSTING IN THE MIGHTY ANGEL. I AM FULLY trusting and believing that he is as good as his word. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take away and I'm not going to add to his word. Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; Do you really believe it? Now, let me say [music] this to you. Something begins to change. There's a wind of change in here. Some of you don't recognize it, but I see I see you do. I see you do. &gt;&gt; Because you recognize it is enough. Hallelujah. Let's sing it. Hallelujah. What am I saying to you, church? [music] Get ready for the greatest transition of your life. YOU'RE IN LEOSA AND YOU'RE DONE. You can't handle it no more. &gt;&gt; HONESTLY, YOUR FLESH is at its limitations. But get ready. God says it's enough. I done watched Leodysia whip you. I done Leodysia. I done watched everything that Leodysia can throw at you. But it's time for the greatest extraction. [music] Hallelujah. The world seen UFOs. THE WORLD SEES JUDGMENTS OUT THERE. But we recognize that them angels out there. &gt;&gt; It is enough. Do you know that he's worthy? Oh, I wish [music] you could hear me. I wish you could hear me from my soul. I know I didn't say it enough words from English language. It is enough. It is enough. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Father, we feel your mighty presence in this place. Lord Jesus, we feel you putting the limitations on Satan's hold in our life. And Father, we just invite you just now to come and minister. Father, let your August presence just settle over this congregation. Lord Jesus, may they look away to Jesus just now. That little woman with the alabaster box, [snorts] she got it doing some bad things, but it was enough. Hallelujah. When the woman at the well left that well that day, what she had was more than enough. Father, this message is more than enough to put us right where we need to be at. Father, I pray that you'd [music] stop the hands of Satan. Lord, for every need here, for brother Matthew that's reeling in pain tonight, I pray Lord Jesus, that the stripes that you took [music] at Pilot's judgment hall, that was more than enough. You'd release the very bonds of his imprisonment [music] just now in his body. for brother Ron. Hallelujah. For sister one. &gt;&gt; For brother Jeff. &gt;&gt; Oh God. For all the church here. It is enough. I ain't got to beat you again. I ain't got to go to purgatory. You paid it. I'm not renting it. I'm not renting it. Satan, do you hear me? [music] You're not living in my mind rentree. God owns his house. &gt;&gt; God owns my mind. God owns my spirit. God owns my soul. And I rebuke the very powers of hell. Satan, remove and go from here to yonder in the name of Jesus. And the church says it is enough. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Do you have &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Is he worthy [singing] of [music] this? He is. [music] Does the Father [music] truly love [singing] us? Oh hallelujah. Does the spirit [music] move among us? &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And [music and singing] does Jesus far forever [music and singing] those he loves? [music] Does our God intend [singing and music] to dwell again with us? [music] Is anyone [singing] worthy? Come on. Oh, [music] is anyone? Oh, is anyone [music and singing] able to break the sea and open the scroll? [music] Oh, the lion of Judah. Oh, who conquered [singing] the grave. [music] He is truth and the [singing] lamb who died to res [music] the slave. every people and [singing] tribe, [music] every nation and tongue. He has made us [music] a kingdom and praise to God to reign with the son. [singing] Is he worthy? Is he worthy [music] of all blessing [singing] and honor and glory? Is he [singing] worthy [music] of him? Say it. [music] One more time. Saying unto him. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he [music] &gt;&gt; from every [music and singing] people and child, every nation? [music] [music] &gt;&gt; You've been waiting for this moment. Go ahead. It's enough. Your worship is enough. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Lord Jesus is &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. worthy of this. [music] &gt;&gt; Does the father truly love us? [singing] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Does the father truly love [singing] us? &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Does the spirit [singing] move among us? [music] &gt;&gt; Does Jesus [music] our Messiah hold forever [singing] those he loves? [music] Does our God [music and singing] intend to dwell again? [music] [singing] Is anyone home? [music] Is anyone able to break the spirit and open the scroll? [music] Lion [singing] of Judah. Conquer [music] the grave. The lamb of [singing] God [music] rest on the merry people [singing] and [music] every nation. Praise God. [music] [singing] [music] Is he worthy? [music] Is he worth [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; an answer [music] to the questions [singing] and the fears and the wise. [music] Some of my [singing] is desperate [music] from the past. The [music] chains in life. Feel like [singing] you wasted so [music] much time. Want to move ahead, [music and singing] but you're still lasting life. [music] Feel like [singing] you're running will never end. [singing] And you'll never never wait. [singing] I don't [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I don't know. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; But my God, [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; are you that somebody? Somebody [singing] here. [music] needs an answer [music] to the question, the fear [music] and why. Somebody [singing] here [music] is desperate for freom [music] from the past the tree [singing] and life. [music] Feel like you [music and singing] wasted so much time. Want to move [music and singing] ahead, but you're still lasting life. [music] Feel like [singing] you're running will never [music] rain and [singing] you will never [music] wait. I don't [singing] know. [music] I don't [music] know. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know. [music] [music] I don't know.

I was getting ready to leave my house and the spirit of God spoke to me this song. And I want you to recognize this moment. God set up the atmosphere for this moment right here. &gt;&gt; I hope you can hear the angels of God as brother Matt bumped into an angel and he started worshiping. Brother Matt didn't pick that song out. The angel OF THE LORD PICKED IT OUT FOR THIS ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; I don't know who told you. I don't know who told you that you wouldn't make it. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULDN'T TAKE IT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT IT'S TIME THAT YOU QUIT. But my God, &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know my GOD OR NOT, BUT MY GOD, MY GOD CREATED THE MOONS AND THE STARS. MY GOD HAS NEVER GAVE UP. MY GOD HAS NEVER LOST THE BATTLE. My God, I wonder. [music] My God said it ain't over. until he says it's over. [applause and music] It [singing] ain't over till God says it's [music] over. And I say that this ain't [singing] it ain't over yet. [music] It ain't over [singing] till God says [music] over. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I say that this ain't over [music] yet. I don't [singing] know who told you that you [music] would not make it. [singing] And I don't know who [music] told you. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Just go ahead and praise the Lord for a minute.

It's time [music] you but my [singing] God says away. &gt;&gt; [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; Go ahead and rejoice and thank the Lord. Go ahead. [music] [music] You know the same devil that's telling you you can't win. Why don't we tell him [music] something back tonight? If I can sing this. I just can't cross the bloodline, but I'm covered by his blood. [singing] You may [music] stare and you may [singing] fight, but you're going to lose this battle tonight. Remember, [music] [singing] you can't crawl. Sing that chorus again. Why don't you tell the devil that's telling you you can't make it? I just got [singing] to tell Satan [music] you can't cross the blood line [singing] because I'm covered by [music] you. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; And you may fight, but you're [music] going to lose this [singing] battle. And I remember [music] you can't cross more time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I just [singing] got to tell you, Satan, you can't cross [music and singing] the bloodline because I'm covered by [music and singing] his blood.
