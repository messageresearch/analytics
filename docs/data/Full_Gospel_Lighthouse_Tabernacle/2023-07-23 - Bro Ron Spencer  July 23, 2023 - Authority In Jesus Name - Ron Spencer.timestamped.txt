[51:00] I'd like to speak to you today on the
[51:02] authority
[51:03] in the name of Jesus Christ
[51:07] Authority is more than power
[51:10] but it is your right
[51:12] it is given to you from a higher or
[51:15] higher Realm but knowing who you are and
[51:19] what you are as Sons and Daughters of
[51:21] God gives you Authority it's like a
[51:23] police officer and we've got serval that

[51:29] it's just not your physical frame that
[51:31] you're representing you're representing
[51:33] the city all the dignitaries of that
[51:36] City you're representing the school that
[51:38] you came from to be a be an officer now
[51:41] you may not have the power to stop a
[51:43] bicycle
[51:48] but you've got the authority to step out
[51:50] in the middle of the road and blow a
[51:52] whistle and throw your hand up
[51:55] buses tractor trailers has to come to a
[51:58] screeching heart
[52:00] as a Christian you may not feel so
[52:03] strong there's maybe times that you feel
[52:06] incredibly weak but because you are who
[52:09] you are
[52:11] you may not have power to hard to get
[52:13] yourself out of bed but because you are
[52:16] a son and daughter of God regardless of
[52:19] how you feel
[52:21] you can take the word of God and raise
[52:24] your hand before the before the enemy
[52:26] and said that's far enough
[52:29] and then across your lips you're
[52:31] Supernatural you begin to speak the
[52:33] supernatural word of God the Bible is
[52:37] God's word to you
[52:40] and it's given to you he couldn't have
[52:42] given you a greater thing when he gave
[52:44] you his word and there's promises in it
[52:46] all through the scriptures and as a son
[52:49] and daughter of God you have a position
[52:51] with him but you must exercise your
[52:54] Authority
[52:57] amen
[52:59] let me just read you a prayer
[53:01] Lord Jesus you are the name above every
[53:06] name
[53:07] your name is like a fortified Tower
[53:11] in which I can find Safety and Security
[53:15] when I'm troubled I can find peace in
[53:18] your name
[53:19] when I am weak I can find strength in
[53:23] your name
[53:24] when I am overwhelmed I can find rest in
[53:28] your name I'm going to get to your house
[53:29] in a minute when I am surrounded by the
[53:32] pressures on every side I can find
[53:35] stability in your name
[53:37] you're my ever-present help in the time
[53:40] of trouble when it seems like my world
[53:43] is crumbling around me and I'm thrown
[53:46] against the storms of my life take away
[53:49] my fear when I'm weak You Are My
[53:53] Strength when I am vulnerable you are my
[53:56] refuge when I cry for help you will
[54:00] answer me
[54:01] you are the prince of peace and you
[54:04] breathed on your disciples and you gave
[54:07] them peace
[54:10] God told Joseph Joshua said it every
[54:13] place that the soul of your foot Treads
[54:16] upon
[54:17] I have given it to you
[54:20] so footsteps mean possessions
[54:25] brother Brown says now now we're more
[54:28] than conquerors
[54:29] we just walk right into it as our
[54:32] inheritance more than conquerors that's
[54:35] quite a statement isn't it now we're
[54:37] dealing with a defeated enemy
[54:42] sickness is defeated
[54:45] death is defeated
[54:47] hell is defeated
[54:49] everything is defeated I wish I was
[54:52] twice the size that I am right now
[54:55] while I feel good
[54:57] we are disputing with a conquered enemy
[55:03] Give the Lord a good hand right there
[55:12] the hour of charge is at hand
[55:15] soldier with armors with armors gleaming
[55:19] and color Streaming Faith and doubt is
[55:21] setting your yourself in a ray in this
[55:24] Tabernacle this morning doubt on one
[55:27] side faith on the other soldiers
[55:30] scan to your post of Duty
[55:33] our captain the more the Morning Star
[55:36] leads us
[55:37] he never goes back
[55:40] he don't know the word retreat
[55:45] so we don't have to retreat
[55:49] remember this and I'll just share a
[55:51] couple of thoughts with you he slipped
[55:53] the wedding band on you before the
[55:54] foundation of the world
[56:00] Hallelujah I want to remind you you are
[56:03] a son and daughter of God
[56:06] I don't care how the devil whips you
[56:08] beats you frails on you
[56:10] you're a son and daughter of God God
[56:13] built you
[56:14] to be an overcomer and he chose this age
[56:17] for you to live in
[56:20] so you will win
[56:25] I'm not concerned about what's in the
[56:27] pages of your life in the dash you will
[56:31] win you came from God you're going back
[56:34] to God
[56:37] I want you to think about this we are
[56:39] filled with the Holy Ghost
[56:41] that's God's seal on our life that he's
[56:44] got confidence in God cleaned us out he
[56:47] washed us out
[56:49] he filled us with his life
[56:52] then we become a reflection of him
[56:58] we become a reflection of him now think
[57:00] about this
[57:01] the rapture
[57:04] can't happen without you
[57:10] oh brother I am afraid I'm going to miss
[57:12] it it can't happen without you
[57:16] if you're part of him and you're sealed
[57:18] with the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the
[57:21] day of redemption Satan can't get to you
[57:23] or he may bother your flesh and he may
[57:26] get get in your spirit times but he
[57:28] can't get to that Gene seed of God
[57:30] [Applause]
[57:31] so when God looks at you he sees part of
[57:34] himself there he's not leaving it here
[57:36] for the tribulation period
[57:41] are you with me now
[57:43] when Jesus healed people he just didn't
[57:46] do it just just to show his power he did
[57:49] it to fulfill the word of God
[57:51] that's what our ambition and our purpose
[57:54] is to fulfill God's will
[57:59] the scripture says come out of her my
[58:01] people and be not a partaker of her
[58:03] place and God draws you from many
[58:06] different directions of Life maybe you
[58:08] didn't realize how it was his drawing
[58:10] power maybe you think I'm sitting here
[58:13] by an accident I'm sitting here by by
[58:15] some different reason I don't even know
[58:17] why I'm here God draws you here
[58:21] I want you to always realist realize
[58:24] this God will never lose one
[58:29] oh
[58:32] think about how great
[58:35] how great God looks at you
[58:38] God will never lose one
[58:44] that means more than life itself
[58:47] you can grab a halt of it you know a lot
[58:50] of times we displease ourselves we
[58:52] displease our spouse we displease our
[58:55] children but we never want to displease
[58:57] God
[58:58] [Music]
[58:59] last weekend when I left the pulpit it
[59:02] just seemed like the enemy jumped on me
[59:03] yeah even me he jumped on me and he's
[59:06] just as I had preached to you about our
[59:08] garment change how that we change
[59:10] garments from from the world to become a
[59:13] Christian filled with the Holy Ghost one
[59:15] day we will step into a new body when we
[59:18] die no matter what age that it is we
[59:20] step into a brand new body a body that
[59:23] Jesus said I go to prepare a place for
[59:25] you I stepped out of the pulpit and
[59:27] immediately the enemy began to bombard
[59:29] my mind it bombard my spirit I went home
[59:32] and he continued to bombard me and I
[59:35] just I felt Melancholy I felt I felt
[59:38] kind of nervous in my spirit and they
[59:41] just kept going through and you know
[59:42] sometimes ministers long suffering is
[59:45] you preach it and then you long suffer
[59:48] and so the enemy is just pounding on me
[59:50] and beating on me and so I even went to
[59:53] bed and I prayed about it went to bed
[59:56] and through the night I began to I began
[59:59] to have have uh uh nightmares and as the
[1:00:03] nightmares persisted I got up and I was
[1:00:05] just when I got up the next morning you
[1:00:07] know I was just you know I was just kind
[1:00:10] of feeling all of that Gloom and all
[1:00:12] those dark clouds and and I went and got
[1:00:14] coffee and I'm not great big coffee
[1:00:16] drinker now but I went and got coffee
[1:00:19] and I I got my cup and I was up early in
[1:00:22] the morning sister Connie hadn't moved
[1:00:24] yet and I I was just up I was trying to
[1:00:27] be quiet
[1:00:28] you know the older you get the less
[1:00:30] hearing that you have but you still
[1:00:31] shake the house and so and so anyway I
[1:00:34] was just shake I was coming back through
[1:00:36] the living room going to the office and
[1:00:38] the spirit of the Lord spoke to me
[1:00:43] and he began to speak to me and he said
[1:00:45] it's time now to go on the offensive
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:52] so when the enemy beats on you and
[1:00:54] frails on you he really don't know what
[1:00:56] he's doing
[1:00:57] it's kind of like poking a bear
[1:01:02] poking a tiger
[1:01:04] poking a Son of God or a daughter of God
[1:01:07] he can pick on you for a little while
[1:01:09] and then you turn your attention on him
[1:01:11] and when you turn your attention on him
[1:01:14] every devil in Hell's got trouble
[1:01:16] because of you who you are
[1:01:25] you have the power to bind and to loose
[1:01:28] the power to speak God's word and shake
[1:01:31] the kings of hell
[1:01:33] prayer is like an atomic bomb
[1:01:37] to destroy the cluster bomb to destroy
[1:01:41] the enemy that comes against you we
[1:01:44] realize that as a wife of almighty God
[1:01:47] you have checked book Authority
[1:01:53] husbands and wives that are sitting here
[1:01:55] when you said I do the day that you said
[1:01:58] I do if you did it right
[1:02:02] his and hers and his and it becomes ours
[1:02:05] but let me just say this to you
[1:02:07] everything that Jesus owns is yours
[1:02:11] all of Heaven is yours
[1:02:14] don't look at your temporary situation
[1:02:16] feel sorry for yourself God owns it all
[1:02:20] so that means he owns all the gold he
[1:02:22] owns all the colonians on the all
[1:02:25] he owns the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:02:28] so if God owns it and you're his wife
[1:02:30] you learn it too
[1:02:36] Hallelujah
[1:02:40] now Satan so many times he'll tell you
[1:02:43] you're you know you're you know nobody
[1:02:46] loves you nobody cares for you
[1:02:50] you're not at you're you're you're a
[1:02:52] hypocrite you're you're backslidden you
[1:02:55] know God don't care for you all of those
[1:02:57] different kind of things remember he's a
[1:02:58] liar
[1:03:02] remember he's a liar remember that God
[1:03:05] has already called you
[1:03:07] and when he called you
[1:03:09] he justified you and then he fills you
[1:03:13] with the Holy Spirit
[1:03:15] sure it was a process that you went
[1:03:17] through but once God starts a work
[1:03:21] he don't fit he don't quit on his job
[1:03:25] he's not the kind of contractor that
[1:03:27] gets overwhelmed and all of a sudden he
[1:03:29] decides it's just too big of a job he he
[1:03:33] knew where you was
[1:03:35] drunk prostitute dope addict God knows
[1:03:39] exactly where you are he's got a blood
[1:03:41] for that
[1:03:44] he's got a blood for that
[1:03:50] are you with me now
[1:03:52] Jesus would say that it might be
[1:03:55] fulfilled
[1:03:56] that it might be fulfilled and he went
[1:03:59] about to fulfill the word of God
[1:04:01] we are here
[1:04:03] that it might be fulfilled
[1:04:07] you were actually fulfilling scripture
[1:04:10] sitting where you're at
[1:04:14] now I want you to think about it
[1:04:16] if the enemy could have stopped you from
[1:04:19] coming to church today
[1:04:26] I don't know if you went through
[1:04:27] anything this week but if he could have
[1:04:29] stopped you
[1:04:31] he Wars in your mind he Wars in your
[1:04:34] attitudes he Wars are you with me am I
[1:04:36] am I preaching to the right Church
[1:04:38] he Wars with you sister Megan I just pre
[1:04:41] I just talked to you yesterday and you
[1:04:43] you lost a family member you were
[1:04:45] crushed
[1:04:47] but you've got Jesus
[1:04:49] and he hears any answers and he watches
[1:04:52] over let me just say the world has
[1:04:54] calamities and so will we the world has
[1:04:57] problems but so will we but we heard an
[1:04:59] incredible youth group said but I got
[1:05:01] Jesus
[1:05:05] I got something that the world ain't got
[1:05:07] I got Jesus and the greatest thing he's
[1:05:11] got me
[1:05:12] [Applause]
[1:05:23] you are here for a purpose
[1:05:27] you are here to destroy the works of the
[1:05:30] devil
[1:05:32] because you have a part of what that to
[1:05:35] do
[1:05:36] Jesus came to destroy the works of the
[1:05:39] devil
[1:05:40] then your purpose as his offspring his
[1:05:44] sons and daughters we had the same
[1:05:46] ambition

[1:05:52] devil can you repeat that with me I'm
[1:05:55] going to destroy the works of the devil

[1:06:00] pounds soaking wet
[1:06:06] I'm not going any higher than that

[1:06:12] but let me just say this to you you may
[1:06:15] not have the power to pick up a a car
[1:06:22] but you got the power to stop the enemy

[1:06:33] that we're coming after your children

[1:07:58] as a representative name I come to
[1:08:01] represent him who stripped you of every
[1:08:03] Authority that you had at Calvary Jesus
[1:08:07] Christ the son of God he spoiled you and
[1:08:10] you have no power you're a bluff and
[1:08:13] we're calling your hand in the name of
[1:08:15] Jesus Christ come out of the woman I
[1:08:18] jury thee by God that you leave him
[1:08:26] one of the most powerful words that you
[1:08:29] will ever use as a Christian
[1:08:31] when you identify Satan has walked into
[1:08:34] your space
[1:08:35] leave
[1:08:38] can you say that with me leave
[1:08:45] Hallelujah you got a space
[1:08:49] you know a lot of people like to get
[1:08:51] right up in your space to talk to you I
[1:08:53] can hear
[1:08:58] and Satan likes to get in your spirits
[1:09:00] leave
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:05] then in the Jesus Christ's name Satan
[1:09:09] you who have done the evil you're not
[1:09:11] afraid of me did I just read that
[1:09:20] but I come as an interrepresentative
[1:09:22] name I come into represent him who
[1:09:25] stripped you of every Authority that you
[1:09:27] had at Calvary Jesus Christ the son of
[1:09:30] God he spoiled you you have no power
[1:09:32] you're a bluff
[1:09:35] we'll call in your hand
[1:09:37] in the name of Jesus Christ come out of
[1:09:40] the woman I adjure Thee
[1:09:42] by the Living God
[1:09:45] that you leave her
[1:09:48] it's good the second time
[1:09:50] sometimes I think we need to read it 10
[1:09:52] times
[1:09:55] our life is hitting God through Christ
[1:09:58] sealed by the Holy Ghost and raised up
[1:10:01] with him sitting with Heavenly places
[1:10:03] watching him think of it no power but
[1:10:06] Authority we don't have power we have
[1:10:08] authority Christ has the power he is the
[1:10:12] power but we have authority
[1:10:16] we don't have any power but we have
[1:10:18] authority
[1:10:20] it don't take power someone said you got
[1:10:24] any power no but I got Authority
[1:10:29] you take a little policeman standing out
[1:10:31] there he wears a uniform his hat is too
[1:10:34] big for him sets down over his ears he
[1:10:37] hasn't got power to stop nothing but let
[1:10:39] him walk out there and a car is coming
[1:10:42] down the street 300 horsepower engine
[1:10:44] let him raise up his hand watch the
[1:10:46] break slide he hasn't got power but he's
[1:10:49] got Authority
[1:10:51] and when a man and woman is Anointed
[1:10:53] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:10:56] might not be able to read his name in
[1:10:58] boxcar letters with education but he's
[1:11:01] got Authority with God because he is a
[1:11:04] son of God
[1:11:09] um
[1:11:10] John chapter 10 and verse 17 great quote
[1:11:13] book therefore doth my father love me
[1:11:16] because I lay down my life that I might
[1:11:18] take it up again
[1:11:22] notice what he's saying no man taketh it
[1:11:25] from me
[1:11:26] but I lay it down on myself
[1:11:28] I have power to lay it down and I have
[1:11:31] power to take it up again
[1:11:33] this commandment I received of my father
[1:11:36] where did he get that kind of a word he
[1:11:40] read it in the scripture
[1:11:42] and the scripture gave him power and
[1:11:45] authority to do it when you read it in
[1:11:48] the scripture
[1:11:52] Hallelujah don't you love him
[1:11:54] Joshua chapter 1 and verse 1. now after
[1:11:58] the death of Moses the servant of the
[1:11:59] Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake
[1:12:02] unto Joshua with the son of none Moses's
[1:12:04] Minister saying Moses my servant is dead
[1:12:07] now therefore arise and go over this
[1:12:10] Jordan you heard this last Saturday
[1:12:11] night and all the people into the land
[1:12:14] which I do give them even to the
[1:12:16] children of Israel every place that the
[1:12:19] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[1:12:22] have I given to you as I said unto Moses
[1:12:28] from the Wilderness and for and this
[1:12:31] this Lebanon even to the Great River the
[1:12:33] river Euphrates all the land of the high
[1:12:36] Tates under the great sea toward the
[1:12:37] going down of the sun shall be your
[1:12:40] Coast
[1:12:41] there shall not any man be able to stand
[1:12:43] before thee all the days of my life
[1:12:46] notice this next words as I was with
[1:12:48] Moses so I will be with thee I will not
[1:12:52] fail thee nor forsake thee read the next
[1:12:57] words be strong and of a good courage
[1:13:07] brother Brown Andrew quoted this last
[1:13:09] night he said he knows
[1:13:12] that if the people get the true
[1:13:14] revelation of the true church in what
[1:13:16] she is and what she stands for
[1:13:18] she can do the Greater Works
[1:13:24] she will be an invincible Army
[1:13:29] not because it's greater than what Jesus
[1:13:32] did but it's more people doing the same
[1:13:35] works
[1:13:38] but I can't get the phone call to the
[1:13:40] preacher you got the same God
[1:13:43] I may not be there in your hour of
[1:13:46] Crisis but let me just say this you he
[1:13:49] is always with you
[1:13:56] Hallelujah now sons and daughters
[1:13:59] who has the most power before God an
[1:14:03] angel a servant is that right they're
[1:14:06] his servants
[1:14:08] what are you
[1:14:10] his son and daughter
[1:14:13] who has the most power in heaven then a
[1:14:17] sinner that's been saved by the grace or
[1:14:19] an archangel that stands by his right
[1:14:21] side The Sinner that's been saved by
[1:14:25] grace has more Authority in heaven than
[1:14:28] an archangel that has stood by his side
[1:14:31] without sin because
[1:14:36] you're his son
[1:14:39] now let me just say this to you we we
[1:14:41] have seen the angel of the Lord in this
[1:14:43] building it does that's much good when
[1:14:46] we see the presence of the god here
[1:14:48] we've seen the pillar of fire we've seen
[1:14:51] lights we've seen we've seen the Angels
[1:14:53] stand in physical form amongst us and if
[1:14:56] every one of us could see the pillar of
[1:14:58] fire all we could dance we could dance
[1:15:00] but let me just say
[1:15:01] people that are setting in this piece
[1:15:06] reach over touch your neighbor said now
[1:15:08] he's going to talk about you
[1:15:11] now he's going to talk about me
[1:15:13] if you could see the angel of God
[1:15:15] standing right here it would do you good
[1:15:18] but if you can realize who you are
[1:15:20] [Music]
[1:15:24] you have more Authority than that angel
[1:15:26] that's standing right there
[1:15:35] in Luke chapter 11 and verse 9.
[1:15:37] and I say unto you
[1:15:40] ask
[1:15:42] and it shall be given to you
[1:15:46] speak
[1:15:47] and you shall find
[1:15:49] knock

[1:19:41] will create an atmosphere around you as
[1:19:43] a man
[1:19:51] why Christ speak
[1:19:53] he spoke and the blind Saul
[1:19:57] the lame walk the deaf heard the demon
[1:20:00] screamed I'll come out that the dead was
[1:20:02] raised up
[1:20:04] he didn't have to pray through he was
[1:20:05] the anointed Messiah
[1:20:07] he was that Messiah he knew he was he
[1:20:11] knew his position he knowed what he was
[1:20:13] sent to do he knowed that the father had
[1:20:16] identified him to be the Messiah to be a
[1:20:19] believer the believer and when he met
[1:20:22] that believer with faith he just spoke
[1:20:25] the word and devil scattered
[1:20:28] speak don't cry speak
[1:20:31] he knew his god-given rights
[1:20:35] many times we don't he knew what he was
[1:20:39] many times we don't Moses forgot Sanson
[1:20:44] understood others understood Joshua
[1:20:46] understood Moses forgot God had to call
[1:20:49] his attention to it why are you crying
[1:20:51] to me I sent you to do the job speak and
[1:20:54] go forth that's your purpose
[1:20:58] that's your objective I told you you'd
[1:21:01] come to this mountain take them children
[1:21:03] and lead them on just speak I don't care
[1:21:06] what's in your way move it out I give
[1:21:09] you authority to do it you spoke flies
[1:21:12] and fleas and creation and things like
[1:21:14] that now what are you hollering to me
[1:21:16] about why are you coming to me hollering
[1:21:18] these things just speak and watch it
[1:21:20] move
[1:21:23] but notice he had to do something
[1:21:25] sometimes you got to do something
[1:21:28] and you got Authority in the name of
[1:21:30] Jesus Christ but you got to exercise it
[1:21:35] hear Jesus and everything that he he
[1:21:37] said he just spoke the word and it was
[1:21:40] so God properly had a Vindicated him to
[1:21:43] be his son this is my beloved Son in
[1:21:46] whom I'm well pleased watch him I like
[1:21:49] this now how bravely how majestically he
[1:21:53] stood before his critics destroy this
[1:21:56] Temple
[1:21:59] and I pray the father and see what he
[1:22:02] does about it destroy this Temple and
[1:22:05] I'll raise it up again in three days
[1:22:09] not I hope to
[1:22:12] I'm going to try to
[1:22:14] I will do it
[1:22:18] the scripture said so the same scripture
[1:22:21] that said he would raise up his body
[1:22:23] gives us Authority and power in the name
[1:22:26] of Jesus Christ to cast out devils
[1:22:29] they'll speak with new tongues and if
[1:22:32] they take up serpents or drink any
[1:22:33] deadly thing it won't harm them lay
[1:22:36] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:22:42] not that we have the power
[1:22:46] I can't heal you Jesus has already
[1:22:48] healed you but he instructed me to put
[1:22:51] my Earthly hands on the sick person and
[1:22:55] the scripture said they shall recover
[1:23:00] we just expect God to do what he said he
[1:23:03] would do
[1:23:07] preach with me now remember they had to
[1:23:10] work
[1:23:11] and the Word was made flesh and the word
[1:23:13] told them I'd give you power I give you
[1:23:16] power they had power but they didn't
[1:23:18] have faith to operate the word that was
[1:23:20] in them see what I mean but Jesus had it
[1:23:23] he was the word he had faith and what he
[1:23:27] said would happen he said oh bring him
[1:23:29] here how long will I suffer you he had
[1:23:33] Faith with his power
[1:23:35] how did he he said I can do nothing in
[1:23:39] myself
[1:23:40] he relied upon what he was he relied on
[1:23:43] knowing that he was the work
[1:23:48] he had faith in God who made him the
[1:23:52] word he was God the word they was in him
[1:23:56] that give him Faith because he
[1:23:59] understood his position he knowed what
[1:24:02] he was because the scripture had said he
[1:24:05] was this and hear exactly the scripture
[1:24:09] tied in proved that he was exactly what
[1:24:12] the scripture said he would be and he
[1:24:14] knew what he was
[1:24:16] if you can realize who you are and what
[1:24:20] the scripture says about you
[1:24:24] [Music]

[1:28:32] diet that you had me on we'd have been
[1:28:34] here five years ago
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:48] I want to read you my report tomorrow
[1:28:50] afternoon
[1:28:51] it's been my report since I was a little
[1:28:53] child
[1:28:55] he was despised and rejected of men
[1:28:59] a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:29:02] and we here to as it were our faces from
[1:29:05] him and he was despised and we esteemed
[1:29:08] him not surely he hath borne our griefs
[1:29:11] and carried our sorrows and yet we did
[1:29:13] esteem him stricken and smitten of God
[1:29:15] and afflicted
[1:29:16] but he was wounded
[1:29:21] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:29:24] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[1:29:28] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:29:30] and with his stripes
[1:29:37] we are healed
[1:29:41] Isaiah 53 and verse 5 if you'll put it
[1:29:44] right there for us before we go on I
[1:29:46] want to give you
[1:29:48] I report
[1:29:50] read it with me but he was wounded for
[1:29:54] our transgressions he was bruised for
[1:29:57] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[1:30:01] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:30:10] who do you worship
[1:30:13] the disease of God
[1:30:16] who is more powerful the disease of God
[1:30:21] who wins in the end the disease or God
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:37] Mark chapter 16 Jesus's final words
[1:30:44] some of them
[1:30:45] go into all the world
[1:30:48] and preach the gospel to every creature
[1:30:52] and he that believeth and is baptized
[1:30:54] shall be saved
[1:30:57] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:30:59] damned that's pretty clear isn't it

[1:32:04] don't start talking his language just
[1:32:06] tell him leave
[1:32:12] and they shall speak with new tongues
[1:32:16] Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5. behold I
[1:32:19] sin you
[1:32:22] Elijah
[1:32:24] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:32:26] Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:32:28] it's going to be great for believers
[1:32:30] it's going to be dreadful for
[1:32:30] unbelievers
[1:32:32] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:32:34] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[1:32:36] the children to the fathers lest I come
[1:32:39] and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:32:41] Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the
[1:32:45] day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:32:46] were all in one place and in one Accord
[1:32:51] are you with me I'll give you a homework
[1:32:53] assignment go home this week and listen
[1:32:56] to Wednesday night's service of Aaron
[1:32:58] Oglesby and brother Tim Pruitts that
[1:33:01] means listen to that
[1:33:02] it'll shake the kingdom of hell
[1:33:05] and then when they cut it off just hang
[1:33:08] on just for a little bit they're going
[1:33:09] to cut it right back on and you're going
[1:33:11] to PC people just start shouting under
[1:33:14] the blessings of God when they realize
[1:33:17] what he said about them
[1:33:19] and some of the let me just give you
[1:33:21] some of the thoughts that he said
[1:33:22] getting in one Accord means you got to
[1:33:24] get past yourself
[1:33:27] we come to church to get into church and
[1:33:30] to start worshiping God
[1:33:33] and sometimes you've got to get past
[1:33:35] yourself
[1:33:36] you got to break the barrier of your
[1:33:39] feelings
[1:33:40] he made this statement he said what we
[1:33:43] ought to do in the summertime is go out
[1:33:45] into this open field and have church
[1:33:48] so we'll be thankful for our condition
[1:33:52] he said we come I'm gonna quote him for
[1:33:54] a little bit he said we come to church
[1:33:56] and we look at everybody else around us
[1:33:58] and what they wore and what they dressed
[1:34:00] they didn't sing my favorite songs they
[1:34:03] played their music too loud the sound is
[1:34:05] too loud it's it's a dead spot here and
[1:34:08] it's a dead spot over there and it's too
[1:34:09] loud over here and it's too hot it's too
[1:34:12] cold the fans blowing on me instead of
[1:34:15] coming to church
[1:34:30] sometimes we gotta get past ourselves
[1:34:33] well I'm too tired if you can break
[1:34:35] through into the spirit
[1:34:37] you'll get a refreshing
[1:34:39] well that person they shout you know
[1:34:42] maybe they just they shout every service
[1:34:44] well maybe you need what they got
[1:34:48] and instead of being critical then why
[1:34:50] don't you break through at home when you
[1:34:53] come to church you'll be ready to
[1:34:55] worship the law
[1:35:05] well brother Ron I'm afraid people will
[1:35:07] think I'm a fanatic you didn't mind that
[1:35:10] it's the Baltimore Orioles game you
[1:35:13] didn't mind it it's a football the
[1:35:15] baseball you didn't mind it there
[1:35:23] they're all lost they're all lost and if
[1:35:26] I don't care if they lose every game it
[1:35:29] don't mean nothing to my sleep at night
[1:35:31] but we come to church
[1:35:34] to worship the King of Kings and the
[1:35:38] Lord of lords
[1:35:40] I am not ashamed
[1:36:00] but brother Ron you know we've matured
[1:36:03] and we've got past that know what you've
[1:36:05] got a spiritual arthritis
[1:36:07] [Applause]
[1:36:09] if you'd have been here it used to be I
[1:36:12] used to do this night what about now

[1:36:17] years ago what about now
[1:36:20] [Applause]
[1:36:23] sit here like a cactus and all your
[1:36:25] leaves are all pulled up it's because
[1:36:28] you need some rain in your life
[1:36:30] reign of the Holy Ghost to come down to
[1:36:33] your life to give you authority to
[1:36:35] worship God
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:37:01] yeah
[1:37:03] my favorite president said it's not the
[1:37:06] critic that counts
[1:37:11] the critic has not done anything
[1:37:14] he don't have blood on his sword
[1:37:17] he don't have victories in his pocket
[1:37:20] but the critic can set
[1:37:22] and do nothing but just squawk
[1:37:27] and squawk and squawk let me just say
[1:37:30] don't miss the Rapture because of your
[1:37:32] squawking
[1:37:39] wow you're alive
[1:37:43] while you've got the opportunity
[1:37:46] worship god with everything that is
[1:37:50] within you
[1:37:52] I am not afraid of what somebody else
[1:37:55] says
[1:37:58] I am not ashamed of my king
[1:38:02] brother Ron I'm gonna dance on streets
[1:38:04] ago I doubt that you can't move out of
[1:38:06] your shoes right now
[1:38:08] brother on I'm gonna scream all over
[1:38:10] heaven let me just hear you right down
[1:38:12] here say Amen once in a while I think a
[1:38:15] Revival took place in your life if you
[1:38:17] can get an amen from your belly through
[1:38:20] your lips
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:36] my mother weighed 268 pounds
[1:38:41] she was five foot tall
[1:38:44] she was a rolling
[1:38:47] bowling ball
[1:38:49] on two feet
[1:38:52] my mother's knees were in horrible
[1:38:55] condition
[1:38:57] they were stiff her legs were stiff
[1:39:00] she slept in a lazy boy
[1:39:02] from her 50s
[1:39:04] but when it comes time to worship God
[1:39:09] that 268 pound woman
[1:39:12] shook the house
[1:39:16] don't give me your excuses
[1:39:19] [Applause]
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:29] and if I can stand to you here with
[1:39:31] stage four cancer in my brain and in my
[1:39:34] lungs and in my body I can't take any of
[1:39:37] your excuses
[1:39:40] I don't lay out at church
[1:39:43] sure there's times I feel bad sure
[1:39:46] there's times that come on
[1:39:50] but I have taken your book of excuses I
[1:39:53] throwed it in the trash
[1:39:57] as long as I'm alive I'm gonna praise
[1:40:00] the Lord as long as I'm alive I'm gonna
[1:40:04] torment the kingdom of hell as long as
[1:40:08] I'm alive
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:26] Jesus saith unto them
[1:40:29] I am the way
[1:40:31] the truth
[1:40:34] and the life
[1:40:36] no man cometh unto the father
[1:40:40] but by me
[1:40:43] Jesus is not just one of the ways
[1:40:50] he is the way
[1:40:55] John chapter 3 and verse 16.
[1:40:58] for God so led the world
[1:41:01] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:41:03] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:41:05] perish but have everlasting life
[1:41:07] and God sent not a son into the world to
[1:41:10] condemn the world but through him
[1:41:14] might be saved
[1:41:18] he that believeth on
[1:41:20] on him is not condemned
[1:41:23] and but he that believeth not
[1:41:26] is condemned already you don't have to
[1:41:30] wait to the Judgment bar you're
[1:41:32] condemned already you're either going in
[1:41:35] one direction or the other
[1:41:39] Jesus said these words they may be
[1:41:41] difficult ye are from beneath and I am
[1:41:43] from above
[1:41:45] year of this world but I am not of this
[1:41:47] world
[1:41:48] some of your critics if you can just say
[1:41:51] this in your heart
[1:41:52] it'll get you in trouble if you let it
[1:41:54] go across your lips
[1:41:55] and remember he that's giving you the
[1:41:57] biggest biggest criticism
[1:42:01] you're from beneath
[1:42:06] always consider the source
[1:42:09] Year from beneath
[1:42:11] I'm from above
[1:42:21] now this is a scripture this is more
[1:42:24] than just Jesus's scripture this is our
[1:42:27] destiny I came from God
[1:42:31] I'm going back to God
[1:42:34] I said therefore unto you that ye shall
[1:42:37] die in your sins
[1:42:39] if you believe not that I am he
[1:42:46] Acts chapter 4 and verse 12.
[1:42:49] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:42:56] there is none other name unto Heaven
[1:42:59] given to the men whereby that you must
[1:43:03] be saved
[1:43:06] that's our Authority
[1:43:08] you'll turn with me
[1:43:11] Psalms chapter 91 and verse 1. I want
[1:43:14] you to read it with me
[1:43:16] I'll read the first verse you read the
[1:43:18] second verse
[1:43:19] he that dwelleth in the secret place of
[1:43:22] the most high shall abide unto the
[1:43:24] shadow of the Almighty
[1:43:36] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[1:43:38] Snare of the Fowler and from the noise
[1:43:39] and pestilence
[1:43:41] thank you
[1:43:50] Thou shalt not be afraid by the terror
[1:43:52] by night nor the arrow that flyeth by
[1:43:54] day
[1:44:02] A thousand shall fall at thy side and
[1:44:05] ten thousand at thy right hand but it
[1:44:07] shall not come thy thee
[1:44:15] because thou has made the Lord which is
[1:44:17] my refuge even the most high the
[1:44:20] habitation
[1:44:28] do you believe that
[1:44:32] read it again
[1:44:40] now I want you to read it loud enough
[1:44:42] that the devil can hear it
[1:44:51] on Monday when you have a problem
[1:44:53] reading that scripture
[1:44:55] on Tuesday when you have a problem
[1:44:57] reading that scripture
[1:45:00] those are not your words even David's
[1:45:02] words that's God's words
[1:45:05] next verse
[1:45:09] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:45:12] thee
[1:45:14] to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:45:27] oh Hallelujah Isaiah 40 and verse 29 he
[1:45:32] giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:45:34] that have no might he increases their
[1:45:36] strength even then use that's faint and
[1:45:38] be weary and the young man that shall
[1:45:41] elderly fail but they that weighed upon
[1:45:44] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:45:47] shall Mount up with wings that's an ego
[1:45:50] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:45:53] shall walk and nothing
[1:46:00] laughs
[1:46:04] let me just talk to you for a second I'm
[1:46:05] done
[1:46:09] so the tumors where they lay at
[1:46:12] actually cause nightmares
[1:46:15] the chemo that I take actually calls
[1:46:17] nightmare the other drugs that I take
[1:46:19] actually cause nightmares
[1:46:22] but in spite of that
[1:46:24] there's moments to where I have
[1:46:26] incredible dreams
[1:46:30] so I was walking with an angel this week
[1:46:33] in a dream after all that nonsense that
[1:46:35] I put up with over the last few days
[1:46:40] and the spirit of the Lord began to
[1:46:42] speak to me Ron would you like to fly
[1:46:45] yeah
[1:46:48] on Earth you was a war eagle
[1:46:52] and Eagles have dominion
[1:46:55] and Eagles have the ability to go above
[1:46:58] their storm
[1:47:00] Ron would you like to experience that
[1:47:11] and I begin to flutter
[1:47:13] and all of a sudden I was above the
[1:47:15] storms
[1:47:17] all of a sudden I was a buzzer and you
[1:47:19] know what when I woke up I could feel
[1:47:21] the Holy Ghost all over the room
[1:47:25] because God is my strength
[1:47:28] and he told me I'm a war eagle
[1:47:34] he told me I'm a war eagle
[1:47:39] so I want to finish today with Satan
[1:47:43] have you forgot who you're dealing with
[1:48:07] now I want you to say it I want you to
[1:48:10] say it to your neighbor
[1:48:11] Satan have you forgot who you're dealing
[1:48:14] with
[1:48:19] sister Connie you're not calling your
[1:48:21] mother Satan
[1:48:22] but you're saying it loud enough that
[1:48:24] you can actually hear it probably the
[1:48:26] devil can hear it if she can hear it
[1:48:30] but sometimes you got to remind him
[1:48:34] acquire your shoulders back our Prophet
[1:48:37] did
[1:48:38] and he didn't just do it in
[1:48:40] Jeffersonville he did it all over the
[1:48:42] world
[1:48:44] I'm waiting on something
[1:48:46] you know I'm waiting on him
[1:48:48] and then when he walked in the room he
[1:48:51] said now he's here
[1:48:52] I take every spirit in this building I
[1:48:55] take every Spirit under my control
[1:48:58] roll his shoulders back
[1:49:01] never weighed over 150 pounds
[1:49:04] but he stood there with authority

[2:12:48] make a mention to you and to anybody
[2:12:51] that might hear this on the way of the
[2:12:52] internet we are we have
[2:12:55] we have thousands of tapes that that we
[2:12:58] no longer use I know that there's a few
[2:13:00] that still use our our tape recordings
[2:13:02] there and if you would like to still
[2:13:05] access those if you could just come to
[2:13:07] brother Alden or one of the deacons but
[2:13:09] we have
[2:13:10] more than thousands of them upstairs we
[2:13:13] don't use them anymore because we have
[2:13:14] it on SD cards we have it on our phones
[2:13:17] and so if anybody would like those if
[2:13:19] you could just come and address us and
[2:13:22] we'll we'll make make do to make sure
[2:13:24] that you get those if not we're going to
[2:13:26] reach out to others so we just want to
[2:13:28] make that available to you if you would
[2:13:30] like that because we're trying to
[2:13:32] I don't know if you know this or not but
[2:13:34] the church is growing and so we're
[2:13:36] trying to make arrangements for where we
[2:13:38] can place people at and so we we need to
[2:13:41] make some things happen so but if you
[2:13:43] would like those just please come and
[2:13:45] see one of us and we'll make sure that
[2:13:47] that is available we're not going to
[2:13:48] throw them away but we we've got to put
[2:13:50] them in storage somewhere or do
[2:13:52] something because uh I believe that you
[2:13:55] need seats so and uh so if you would
[2:13:59] like those just come to us mention that
[2:14:01] to one of the brothers we'll make sure
[2:14:02] that it happens and so we just thank the
[2:14:05] Lord that it used to take us it we had
[2:14:07] to ship cargo containers full of message
[2:14:09] tapes across season but now we can send
[2:14:12] the same amount of those tapes in a
[2:14:15] little bitty package or a little bitty
[2:14:16] box and an SD card form send them
[2:14:19] overseas and the shipping cost is very
[2:14:21] minimal compared to what it used to be
[2:14:23] so we we thank the Lord for the
[2:14:25] advancement of it and and so we look at
[2:14:28] how the progress of how that it all has
[2:14:30] transpired throughout the years of the

[2:14:36] phones and you know we've got no excuse
[2:14:38] for listening to the message and putting
[2:14:40] it before us and so we thank the Lord
[2:14:42] for those things but you not only see
[2:14:43] that you see the advancement of young
[2:14:45] people as soon as they come in and get
[2:14:47] birthed under the kingdom of God they're
[2:14:48] they're so knowledgeable of the message
[2:14:50] and this is just an advancement of the
[2:14:52] age and this is the age of the quick
[2:14:54] work and we're seeing the Lord do what
[2:14:56] he said that he would do right here and
