amen glad to have each and every one of you here with us glad to see sister Teresa Sister Sarah Gooden brother Freddie here with us this evening God bless you we're just continuing to praying for y'all each and every one of you here amen I want to thank the Lord for letting our pastor be back in the house Lord with us this evening and he's had a tough couple of weeks but he still chooses to be in the house of the Lord amen thank the Lord for that [Music] hey man there's there's no let up there's no let up just Full Throttle ahead amen if he was able to listen to last night's Services he he spoke for brother Wayne Lawson there at their youth camp and I I tell you it was tremendous and then just at the end of the service hopefully you can go back and you can look watch that it's it's miraculous what the Lord does and I've never seen it before but how he called all them young people up on the platform and they was just huddled around him like that and I tell you it was just special it was special that's that's all I can say about that it was just tremendous just to see that and what the Lord's doing there we want to continue to pray for brother Andrew that God would just use him this evening as he's probably speaking right now so I want to pray for them and then they'll have a prayer line here shortly so we want to pray for the strength in his body and all the other ministers there and give those youth what they need sustain they're the generation that we're we're going to look forward to that we can say hey this is what our pillars are right here amen so this evening we we thank the Lord for being here and God bless you musicians amen this evening I'd like to take a thought on why I have a friend like that well I have a friend like that in today's age you often desire to divide and disconnect it but true true the power of friendship is something that can bring light Joy kindness so we need friendship so might be a little different how we start out but we'll get there hopefully hey Nancy you just pray with me this evening that it it'll come together like what's in my mind you know amen so maybe this evening will turn to John 19. and verse 10 John 19 and verse 10. then saith pilate unto him speaketh thou not unto me knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and the power to release thee and Jesus answered and thou couldst have no power at all against me except it were given from above therefore he that delivereth me unto thee hath the greater sin and from since forth pilate sought to release him but the Jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou were not Caesar's friend whosoever maketh himself the king speaketh against Caesar and when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought Jesus forth sat him down in the Judgment seat and play in a place called the pavement but in the Hebrew gabitha and it was the preparation of the Passover and about the sixth hour and he said unto the Jews behold your king but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shalt I crucify your king and the chief priest answered we have no King but Caesar maybe you have a need upon your heart this evening just pray over the reading of these scriptures dear heavenly father Lord we we thank you for letting us just be able to just join together this evening around the Word of Life Lord and we pray that these scriptures would just lift off the pages this evening and just go to each and every heart Lord anyone that would have a need here tonight we just ask that it would just be Minister too Lord Lord just give us what we need and not what we want this evening Lord Lord just give us an outpouring of the Holy Ghost once more Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen you can be seated so this evening I would like to take that that fault of why I have a friend like that and I'd like to take it from the thought of verse verse 12 in chapter 19 here and it says and then forth pilate sought to release him see pilate wanted to release Jesus at this point but then the Pharisees Cried Out unto him saying if you let this man go Thou Art not a friend Thou Art not Caesar's friend could you just imagine having a friend like that why would you want a friend like Caesar a man that's power hungry a man that's the deceitful a man that is causing the Nations to do things that is just immorally inappropriate but this this pilot wanted to be called a friend of Caesar's now I would hate to think that I chose a friend like Caesar over Jesus Christ as he stood there in pavement before the Judgment seat and Caesar wanting to release him but the Pharisees crying out hey don't forget your friend don't forget your friends so I want to remind each and every one of us this evening young people old people on all be careful of who you put your friendship in amen because the Friendship of Caesar made pilate crucify Christ when he thought to release him he came and said because I have a friend like that because I have a friend that is so deceitful so power hungry but I want to be upon the coattail so to speak of of Caesar I want to ride the power train up to the top because that's where Caesar was hidden he was looking to create a new world create just something that would be just for the Romans and that's what everybody thought at the time that that's the road that it was hitting but even the Pharisees wanted to take that same side that same side of will would have protection underneath Caesar we would have protection underneath Pilate but why would you want a friend like that and maybe you'd be sitting here this evening that you can think I might have a friend like that I might have somebody that's power hungry I might have somebody that's manipulative you know what I mean there I can't say that word exactly but somebody that will make you do things that you really don't want to do but because you're their friend and that friendship has led you down a road of Destruction and now now you see the outcome of it now you later on 2000 years later we can look back and pilot and say look look what you thought look what you did here amen you wouldn't want a friend like that so so why in today's age would we want friends like that around us even now so think about who your friends are children that as we have many that's getting ready and already headed back to school watch Who Your Friends Are be careful of who you put your friendship in there's many adults that are sitting here this evening that they can testify that one time or another in their life they had a bad friend or they had a good friend and a lot of times those bad friends it was bad bad it it was a lot easier to be bad than it was to be good amen it come real quick I know going down the hallways in the high school there was certain groups that were so easy to get caught up in because they were the life of the party they were they were the life of everything they wanted to do well that was that's so easy to go with because that's what the world is going with but it's hard to take the other Road as my dad would tell me you know many times when people would just say stuff and pick on me and do stuff not too much when I was bigger but they would still make fun of you know who I was who I was trying to be I was trying to be a Christian in that day I was trying to walk and stand stand true so he gave me some advice it takes more of a man to carry the Bible down the hallways so offer that to them if they're such a man tell them carry this if you're such a man carry that amen so if you have friends that is not willing to carry the gospel that is not willing to take a stand for Christ you might ought to reconsider your friendships because that friendship might be taking you down a path of Destruction a path of Hell a path of death amen because sin is pleasurable for a season it may seem all fun and games it's all great it's all fine and dandy until you're in the back seat of a cop car it's the truth I had many people that had many regrets when I put them in the back seat of the cop course a lot of regrets good people good people but a lot of regrets in the back seat of a cop car amen but there is a lot of people here that missed that back seat by just a moment a lot of us I at a moment of time we each and every one of us sitting here could have been in the back seat of a cop car and our life changed in a moment because of the friends that we had chose to hang out with but why would you want a friendship like that why would you want to lead to go down a path of destruction pilate sought friendship like that the Pharisees sought leadership like that and even Eve Eve in the Garden of Eden how great it was and there was the serpent but as brother Branham says he misrepresented one word and she believed the misrepresentation of one word that thou shalt not die Thou shalt not and that friendship as brother Brandon would say it an invisible Union of the Bride he says we see that misrepresentation of this word as Satan misrepresented it to Eve caused her to doubt one word just out one word that's all he's got to make you doubt one word yeah and it threw the whole human race into a falling chaos by just one word the whole human race into a fallen chaos with one word but she chose to listen to that one word thou shalt not and it threw the whole human race into chaos division Darkness desolate but we thank God for a way out of it a way out many times our our own life was destruction but I want to I want to say here also that Eve then began the blame game she here's Adam he said because of the woman you gave me you know when you get in a bad spot a lot of times you start pushing it to the next person you start passing the envelope so to speak blaming the next one So Adam blamed Eve and then Eve Bladen the serpent it caused him to crawl upon his belly eat dust the rest of his life the blame game goes a long way in your friendship don't think that you're just going to get by I tell Titus and India all the time you watch Who Your Friends Are because a lot of times you are the brightest light in the darkest group do you understand what I'm saying there because you are a bright light you are Christ and when you're hanging out with a dark group of people the brightest person in the crowd hangs out it shows up I I can't help but show up Christ can't help but show up so you watch who you're hanging out with because you're going to be the one chosen you're going to be the one picked you're going to be the one that gets in trouble out of all of them so so children remember that even parents remember that in Psalms 25 and verse 14 and 15 it says the Friendship of the Lord is for those who fear Him and He makes known unto them his Covenant my eyes are ever toward the lord for he will pluck my feet out of the net oh aren't you so glad that there's times that Lord I need you Lord I'm in a mess I'm tangled up and I have no way out but I need you but his eyes are upon you this word friendship of the Lord it says or a secret counsel having a secret counsel refers to engaging in a private discussion or usually into confidential manner that typically involves sharing sensitive and confidential information discussing personal matters I'll thank you Lord thank you Lord a friendship with the Lord secret counsel one that's not going to go tell everybody on you one that's not going to go and just tell that Satan Satan look what they've done done now no he's a secret counsel the friendship with the Lord is a secret counsel to discuss personal things with you know when you're in the secret Chambers of your prayer room and you can just talk to Jesus one on one and he knows he already knows but he wants to hear you say it sometimes he wants to hear you say Lord you've been so good to me Lord when you got me out of this mess nobody even saw it but you saw it Lord and Lord I Thank you for letting me get out of this mess oh what a friendship what a what a what to be able to just have a secret counsel like that in Galatians 5 and 22 it talks of the fruit of the spirit here it says the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified in the flesh with the afflictions of lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be judicious I'm not saying that right desires of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another and then another translation it says about in Galatians this is the passion translation it says of the fruits it says Divine love in all the variety of expressions joy that overflows peace that subdues patient that endures kindness and action life full of virtue faith that prevails gentleness of the heart and strength of the spirit I like that I like that love in all the variety of expressions we find that each and every one of those in Christ as in verse First Timothy it says it says and Grace our Lord was exceedingly abundantly faith and love which is Christ Jesus which is faithful saying is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners of whom I am chief how be it for this cause I obtain Mercy that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which you're Hereafter believe on him to life Everlasting Oh What A Love Like That a love like that with Christ in that love in all the variety of expressions the Greeks have four words for the the word love enter us is the word that is relationship Sensational relationship with your partner throughout the whole body it expresses Eros how you should love your wife husband loves your wife maybe we'll turn over to don't even have written down but it says husbands love your wives even so is Christ loved the church but that that love like that we look back to Song of Solomon and how that that is filled with the love of Eros and how that that teaches us younger men how to love our wives and us women excuse me not us women I ain't even there but the women how to love their husbands in the Song of Solomon in the eighth chapter and the seventh verse the bride is speaking unto Solomon it says many Waters cannot quench love neither can the floods even drowned it if any man would give all that substance of his house for this love money couldn't buy it from her floods floods couldn't keep them apart floods couldn't drown it from them that's the kind of love that you need to have in your relationship that's the kind of love that you want to look for young people in a husband or a wife that's what you want that kind of love that Above All Things money can't buy it nothing could separate it the devil wants to divide everything he wants to separate everything he wants to separate marriage he wants to separate you but there's no separation in that so you have that in your mind that that love amen another one is storage love it's a family love a love for the family the other one is filio love brotherly love for your brother for your sister then agape love agape love of God's love unconditional love a love that loves like no other that we can't even express how much God loves us amen so many times in friendship I'd like to give the definition it says in Friendship there is more is more than just a casual acquaintance or a social connection it is a bond that is built on love trust Mutual understanding true friends are those who accept us for who we are supporting us through the thick and thin they are there to collaborate our victories to lead us into helping hand during challenging times that's a true friendship right there when the times of your life are struggled the main thing that I've learned in life a lot of times we don't always get it right the first time I told this to my children and my wife the other night in our devotional we don't always get it right the first time in what we would say or what we would think and many times it don't come out like what you're thinking and and so when you try to discipline your children or you you say something to your wife but it comes out worse than what you actually thought I don't know if you've ever had that happen but it's happened at our house praise the Lord maybe I'm just the only one honest here this evening but and then then the Lord will come back and say you might not should have done it just quite like that you know I heard something the other day there's three of the hardest things to say as a southern man I'm sorry please forgive me and Worcestershire sauce those are hard things to say you know but we don't always get it right that first time and so when you have that partner in your life that you go I didn't get it right and they know you didn't get it right and sometimes it takes a while for them to let you know they might let you know quicker than others but but you don't always get it right the first time brother Branham would would say this in one of his sermons and it says no I know you're just home folks here this morning and if I've ever impressed you brother and her sister as a know-it-all please forgive me I don't mean to do that I'm sitting here this morning talking before men who are Scholars men who are smart I'm illiterate I can't even pronounce my scriptures right I got a chapter to read this morning and I'm going to ask my brother if he would read it for me because I can't even pronounce the names of it it's first Chronicles 13 He says if you will brother Jack will you be hunting that up for me for my scripture I can't even pronounce those names and I'm letting him do that because he can pronounce them and I know I'm talking to Smart men and but Brethren these things are done that you might not look at my illiteracy but believe that I'm telling you the truth it's God telling you the truth that's the truth and he says that in trying to do God a service without being in God's will so I want to take this brother Branham standing before this audience of Scholars men and women and he he wants to impress on them that please don't think that I'm a know-it-all but I also want to say here is brother Branham was the prophet brother brother Branham could have carried himself a little differently but to his home folks to his people to the Bride of Jesus Christ he wanted them to make sure he knew he was a he was just a humble man he could have pushed through the scriptures that that was being read here he could have pushed through the the names and and nobody would have said nothing to him there might have been some Scholars or somebody there that would have thought well that's not exactly how he could pronounce it but that's fine that's fine he's given us the message that's laid upon his heart and and he's he's bearing this that I'm not I'm not always getting it right here as far as what I say but but he's presenting the word and he's wanting you to know that I'm trying my best here because when I'm getting it it's fresh and from where I come from we don't know how to say all these things and do all these things and so many times and and we're all people of the valley here we do the same thing we we might say a word a certain way that somebody don't know what you're what you're saying I mean Granddad Homer used to watch a show called a mountain talk and and some of the words that was on the show Mountain talk we knew what they were I mean poke is a sack go down to Creek and it's just right down there yeah and I mean a lot of Northern or other people might not even know what you're talking about but sometimes you just don't get it out the way that people don't understand it that way and so you want them to understand it but you want them to have that friendship because we all want to be friends we all want to have friends we it's just something about us we want to be with people we want to have that and many times as it would say in the Bible it says a brother offended is harder one than a strong City but also when we're saying these things think about it first think about what you're saying I know and people say Well it fell out before I before I could even think about it well that's pretty hard to do sometimes and there's some people that you go I wish I could have duct tape and just put right over their mouth amen we all know one like that amen we thank the Lord for people like that because it makes us better people amen because then we go I need to even do better about thinking about what I say because I don't want to sound like that amen but we want to be friends to them we want to show them kindness we want to show them things but it's hard sometimes so so you got to accept sometimes the way that they are and the way that it's going to come out and you're going oh my word God bless them Hallelujah many times we want as friends we need to learn how to give and take advice not always do we need a yes person in our life everybody likes to hear the word yes you can do this yes you look great in that yes yes you don't you don't need to go on a diet yes you're fine you're fine the way you are yes yes yes we don't always need a yes person in our life sometimes we need that person that says put that donut back or or that that vest might be a little tight on you this evening maybe we'll walk again tomorrow amen so you don't always need that yes person so when you're looking for a bride don't look for one that's going to be yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes you look for a bride or a husband that is a man or a woman of the home one that that knows Christ many times I in today's age you look at the outward first instead of looking at the inside I want to tell you young people their first priority ought to be Christ when you're looking for a husband or wife the first priority ought to be Christ amen brother Branham says it like this and I want to read this passage and excuse my my reading this evening so much but I have so much hay on the fork I don't want to get it messed up now it's a serious thing when you choose a wife a man for the vows here till death do we part and it's how we should keep it and you take that vow before God that only death will separate you and I think that we should a man in his right mind that's planning a future should choose a wife very carefully be careful of what you're doing and a woman choosing a husband or accepting the choice of a husband she should be real careful with what she's doing and especially these days a man should think and pray before he chooses a wife I think today what's got so many divorce cases now that lead the we lead the world in America in divorce cases we lead the rest of the world there's more divorces here than anywhere else in this nation and we sh and we're supposed to be a Christian Nation what a reproach our divorce courts I think are the reason because men got themselves away from God and women got away from God and we find that if a man prayed and a woman prayed over the matter not just look for the pretty set of eyes or big strong shoulders or such as that or someone other than worldly affection but would look to first to God and say God is this your plan so if you're sitting here this evening or if you're by the way the internet and you're looking for a husband you're looking for a wife have you prayed about it have you prayed have you prayed Lord send them maybe that's what you need to pray I don't know you know you you might just be ready but just more simple but pray about the matter many young people sitting here not even looking towards that but you might need to start praying about your future husband or wife Lord help them build the character that I would want in my house and then that's when you start looking for that husband or wife forgive me here as he's talking about here in divorce cases and and I would say that if if he would be in today's age he would shake his head about the divorce cases that we have and but it's not maybe so much divorce cases but just sleeping together or being with each other before even marriage it's rampant in in our nation but that's what Satan wanted to do he wanted to separate marriage he wanted to make adultery okay he wanted to say Satan wanted to tell you it's it's all right to do that it is not all right let me tell you it is a sacred thing and the world has perverted it has divided it the immorality of the today's age but I want to tell you when you're looking for a husband or wife look for that Godly character in them for it says in mark it says a kingdom divided against itself a kingdom that cannot stand if you're living and being with a non-Christian things are so much harder you're at War almost all the time back to back I could not imagine I have a lovely wife Christian wife Godly wife that has raised our kids in the fear of admiration of the Lord I could not imagine coming home and having to straight everything out if I did not have a Christian wife one that taught my children Christ a friend that I could speak with like that I thank the Lord for a wonderful wife like that says unconditional love and acceptance a true friend loves us who we are accepting our flaws or imperfections or embracing our uniqueness and provide us with a safe place for ourselves without fear of rejection aren't you glad that you have someone like that through Christ through Christ that can look down through all of the imperfections through all of you flaws and he says I love you an unconditional love like that A Love Like Ruth and Boaz as Ruth would go to glean in the field she would be with Naomi and she had left and she was a moabitus and as Boaz Came Upon her cleaning in the field he wanted to know who she was by his servants there he wanted to know who this this lady is I have not seen before and as she's gleaning there he tells her don't glean nowhere else look to no other fields but hear he told his servants how to take care of her let her even glean over in the other let her glean where there's even more food than what there is here with the others and I want to say that she did something to to step out when there's many things that people won't do she chose to go and work her beauty could have found her affection in a husband because she was a beautiful lady but she chose to get out in the field she chose to go working for Naomi she chose to go to work and I want to say young people when you're looking for a bride or you're looking for a husband and I and I know this is kind of leading towards that but we have several Youth and several Andrews speaking to several of them but look for ones that work look for ones that do things around the home you don't want just some baby doll princess and you don't want some just gamer that sits on the couch in his mom and Daddy's basement amen so when Ruth was gleaning in the field she said I can work I can do things that caught his eye first so raise up your children how to do things around the house teach them how to do those things I teach we have our kids we have them clean the toilets we have them clean their bathrooms we have them vacuum the floors yes they hate it but what are you doing you're teaching them how to work I teach them how to iron their clothes I do not want them going to their first job interview and the the boss looks across the table and go when was the last time you ironed your shirt as a young age I was taught how to iron so now I can teach my children how to iron and you know what this teaches them when you teach them how to clean the toilets how to clean the bathrooms it makes them not want to go do those things later in life so they'll work a little harder amen but you still got to do it yeah you still got to do it you still got to carry out the trash Monday morning dad come back home today and I actually went up beforehand and we've had a bear getting into our trash and I thought he's going to come home from preaching all these meetings and there's going to be trash all through the woods and I don't want him to have to go pick that up so I went and did that but if I had not heeda went right out there and he'd have picked up the trash so even after all he's been through all that he's done he still will go pick up the trash so think about that kind of thing think about that the power of that working going and doing things think about what that's going to build in your life but see Boaz also looked and he said I know her past she was a moabitus I know what she went through having a husband the first time I know how she left her family how she left her for that land and come to a foreign land with Naomi all of those things all of those little things that that he could have said I don't need a bride like that I I don't want one like that but he chose Ruth through all of that all of that to be his bride what a love what a kinsman redeemer like that what a love that we have in Christ like that what a love that he would come and show us support and encouragement because true friends are our cheerleaders offering unwavering support and encouragement they can motivate and reach that we would reach our fullest potential leading us into helping to achieve our dreams that's what our parents has done for us me Andrew and Whitney so a friendship role as I said before in that storage a love that love of a parent that family love that showed us how to do things and encouraged us encouraged us so you're not don't don't just beat your children and tell them they can't achieve their goals don't keep a cinder block on their head so to speak and say you're not going to ever grow up you're not encourage them to achieve great things and charge them in their life I tell Titus all the time quote the scripture I can do all things through Christ that gives me strength I've encouraged him I'm his biggest cheerleader in life I'm India's biggest cheerleader in life I want them to achieve great things that's what you should want for your children that love that friendship that not you don't want to be a parent that's just buddy buddy and want to show up and be all the world and oh yes I enjoyed the world you go enjoy the world let's do all these things together what kind of parenting is that you're ruining your kids you're ruining your kids if you're trying to be a friend to them instead of being a parent to them amen so don't show them that kind of love be their cheerleader help them along life way they're not going to get it right like I said they're not going to get everything right the first time amen but you've got to be there for them in today's age when there's so much social media and things that are put out before them things in our schools even in the world you you can't walk up and down Walmart or Martins or Target without seeing any of this stuff so you have to be their biggest encourager in life to achieve great things through Christ through Christ that can help them through all of this because he is our greatest friendship in Psalms 23 we we read this we know this it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. it's there it's not that I don't want him as a Lord he's already provided it I've just got to accept it I've just got to believe it he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy saith they comfort me thou prepare us to table before me in the presence of mine enemies now known as my head with all and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever see our Lord he is our emotional and our mental help a genuine friendship a friendship that has a profound impact on our emotional and mental well-being he provides a course of relief during times of distress reduce feelings of loneliness and increase overall happiness and contentment that's what our Lord is there for yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death there's going to be some dark times in your life there's going to be some times in your life that you have nowhere else to turn to but Christ Our Lord is there for us Christ Our Lord is there to lead us and guide us through all of it a truer friend in life as pilate rejected a friendship like Christ you could bring him back stand pilot here today bring him from the regions of the lost and you can ask him what happened two thousand years ago what happened that day and he would stand here and say as I brought him before the Judgment seat and I stood there and then my wife came to me and she says have nothing to do with this just man for I have many dreams about him and as I stood there that day I look before Jesus and I chose friendship the wrong friendship the friendship that led me down a long Lonely Road a low road full of Destruction and death but if I could stand there today if I could look at those Pharisees today I would say Jesus was the friend that I needed Jesus was the leader that I needed when the Pharisees was crying out Caesar is our only King they should have been crying out he is the king of kings he is the Lord of lords he's the truest brightest Morning Star there is he's the greatest friend that I know but they chose a different way he chose to wash the blood of Jesus Christ off his hands he chose to try to wipe it off so even two thousand years later he still can't wipe off the blood of Jesus Christ we could bring back Judas we could say Judas is a carrot As you stood there and you sold Jesus Christ out for gold for silver you could hear the silver rattling on the platform tonight you could say I slayed innocent blood he would say that to you tonight the friend that I should have chosen as I was a disciple as I was a friend to Christ I slayed innocent blood the Roman soldier as you put the spear in his side and he would hear father forgive for they know not what they do he would say I wish I hadn't done that I wish I hadn't put a spear in his side I wish I hadn't because now torment death hell Destruction has led on my life because I chose the wrong road what road would you choose would you stand there and would you trade your friendship over Jesus Christ you might say no no I wouldn't do Jesus like that well don't do them like that today don't choose the world over Jesus Christ today join don't choose some watered down gospel over Jesus Christ today you need of Christ you need Jesus you need this message to clean you oh it's hard sometimes is oh brother brother Matthew you get all over my toes they get all over me all the time and it's just so hard but you need that for a clean you don't want to stand at the end of the road in hell and look and say I wish I'd chose Jesus as my friend I wish I'd would have chose him oh but maybe we'll look and we'll we'll see instead of some of his enemies standing here shadowrack Hebrew children how was it they'd stand there and they'd say oh that morning might have been gloomy all the clouds rolled in the sky that pit of fire it was hotter seven times hotter than hot oh but that Dave's Shadrach Meshach and Abednego as we standing there we turned and we looked and there he was the son of God standing in the fire with us oh he was a friend to me that day he was a friend to me that day Ezekiel Ezekiel I want to call for you testify for us this evening Ezekiel would stand there and he'd say oh I seen him I seen him in the wheel in the middle of the wheel as he stepped out Roland clouds like dust off of his feet that was the son of God that's the greatest friend I've ever known oh Daniel Daniel would say he's the stone he's the one I seen the white wig one oh he's a friend to me oh but let's say what did God say about him what did God say on Mount Transfiguration when they was all standing there and Jesus guessed to the side and God would say from heaven this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him because he's a friend to you God knew that you needed a friend in this day and age God knew what you would need in the times of life like blind Fanny Crosby would say I needed a friend like that she was scorned by the world tortured by hands but she would still cry out pass me not hold gentle savior oh Pass Me Not O General savior hear my humble cry that's the friend I need and I'll stand here before you this evening Matthew Spencer and say the friend that I needed was Jesus Christ he was a best buddy to me in the darkest time of my life he was a time when there was nobody else to turn to but I could turn to Christ I could turn to him brother Brandon would say it like this when I was a little boy I remember I was raised up in a real poor family I remember many times that I would go out with the fellas I couldn't dress like they go out decent places but I don't know there was something about the people I liked I like getting with them but I was more or less what they call the black sheep and when I got saved and I found that something in me that I was thirsting for friend somebody that would be a buddy to me somebody that I could trust somebody that I could sit down and I could talk my troubles with over and over I found a real true satisfaction When I Found Jesus Christ the real true satisfier that takes away all quenches all the thirsts gives you something that just looks for oh he was a friend to me he was a true friend to brother Branham he'll be a true friend to you this evening in the time of your life when you need a true friend he'll be that friend that unconditional agape love that overshadows us in the darkest times of her life he'll be that friend to you this evening he'll come and he'll comfort you he'll lead you be careful who you choose as a friend be careful in this world I could say it like this you show me your music and I'll show you who your friends are what you're listening to will tell you what you're eating in today's world today's music the way that it is turned Morgan Wallen wasted on you he's going to get to his end to his last day and he's going to say Satan I've wasted so much on you young people you know what I'm talking about waste it wasted on Satan wasted on him be careful what you're listening to be careful what low roads you're going down choose your friends wisely Eve she just stopped long enough to be deceived just long enough to be deceived brother Branham says if she had not have stopped there had never been no deceiving but Eve stopped and when she stopped that's where she got her deceiving instead of pressing on the reason Eve was deceived she never kept the full word of God Satan quoted it to her but he never told her the whole truth but she'd say long enough to hear part of the word and didn't take all of the word and that's what's the matter today the sleeping version has stayed long enough to get part of the word but not all the word the deceived Church stays long enough to get part of the word but not all of the word don't just listen to just get part of it get the whole word don't be deceived by it don't be out as those foolish virgins no no o in your lamps have your lamps trimmed and burning create an atmosphere in your home
