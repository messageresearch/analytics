[0:51] is any good to us and some tough bugs
[1:00] that's gone around and we've got a bug
[1:04] here now that's you better not drink the
[1:07] water
[1:09] Manuel amen
[1:11] things are happening here at this place
[1:13] so today we I watched a special thing
[1:21] take place brother Tim Pruett dedicated
[1:25] brother Michael Dexter it's a little new
[1:28] baby and Brooke and Brooke Kirsten and
[1:33] to the Lord and and if you remember it
[1:37] was her father that was standing in the
[1:41] pulpit that had that had stepped just
[1:43] into the washroom and he just knew in
[1:45] that presence it was just it's just
[1:49] something he'd never felt before and
[1:51] then and then he would go to the pulpit
[1:55] and he'd had a story he had a story that
[1:58] he felt to share and that was the story
[2:01] of that sister miss Cole told at
[2:04] Switzerland that there was a couple that
[2:06] was desiring a baby and they were in a
[2:10] boat with brother branham and they were
[2:11] going across some waters that had had
[2:14] logs in the water and they called him
[2:15] dead heads and the captain of the boat
[2:18] was kind of just earring and all of a
[2:20] sudden just a sudden bump hit the side
[2:24] of the boat
[2:24] and brother branham said no that's
[2:27] that's not a law that's the angel of the
[2:30] Lord and he's came into the boat and
[2:33] he's going to give this lady's want in
[2:35] the child and he's going to give this
[2:37] lady a child and he tells that story and
[2:41] and the Lord that meets us there that
[2:43] day and and and today they had had four
[2:48] miscarriages in a row and after that
[2:52] event took place sister Bethany had a
[2:55] had a pregnancy and and literally every
[2:59] kind of complication that you could have
[3:01] she seemed to be going through it they
[3:03] kept telling their the baby was deformed
[3:06] and all of those different kinds of
[3:08] things and you know all those things
[3:10] just weary in your mind and and we pray
[3:14] for at the meeting and then and then
[3:16] brother Tim had a dream that she would
[3:19] be born and she would be beautiful and
[3:21] everything would be well he dedicated
[3:24] that miracle to the Lord today and so we
[3:27] just thank the Lord for yeah
[3:36] amen brother Jeremy do you have a
[3:38] picture for me I want to share a picture
[3:39] a man this is a miracle at Easter I met
[3:46] this man and brother David sent me a
[3:49] picture of him this morning he said you
[3:50] recognize this man well this man was in
[3:55] and brother David mayor's had came to
[3:58] the meeting as a visitor and he had a
[4:03] hair longer than most of your sisters do
[4:07] and as in a ponytail and he's and his
[4:11] clothes were just really ragged and and
[4:14] he just kind of walked with a stoop like
[4:16] this right here a very tall man about
[4:18] your height brother Josh and he just
[4:20] walked kind of stooped and you can tell
[4:23] he's taller than brother David and
[4:24] brother David is uh is a quite tall man
[4:27] as well well this man he came into
[4:31] prayer line and I told him the Lord told
[4:35] him you have a suicidal spirit and
[4:38] you're fighting depression and God set
[4:42] him free
[4:54] hallelujah I like it when God does work
[4:56] don't you
[4:57] hey man and brother David wanted to send
[5:01] us that and tell us that God's still
[5:03] alive and well a man I believe was
[5:10] Monday morning we got the call that or
[5:13] Monday during the night was that Monday
[5:16] during the night yeah it was Monday
[5:23] during the night 2 a.m. we begin to get
[5:27] calls that brother Terry Melton which
[5:29] his sister Betty sister Betty his
[5:31] brother Joe green sister that that she
[5:35] comes here and many times plays the
[5:37] organ as well and and she stays upstairs
[5:40] and and her husband you know there's
[5:44] just certain people that you just click
[5:45] with and Terry was the kind of guy that
[5:48] just clicked with he was in a good old
[5:50] boy club and hey if just good guy and
[5:54] hunter and fisherman and kind of guy
[5:57] that just kind of stood out on the porch
[5:59] and everybody loved to talk to and all
[6:01] those kind of things and he'd come to
[6:03] church for decades fall different little
[6:05] weaknesses in his life and but he's
[6:08] always would come to church and you know
[6:11] coming to church and knowing the Lord to
[6:13] different things and so he and I were
[6:17] buddies and he was a kind of guy that
[6:19] actually had actually let me hunt in his
[6:22] tree stand to give you an idea he never
[6:25] let none of his boys hunting a tree
[6:27] stand but he let brother Ron hunten his
[6:31] tree stand brother Joe Green never got
[6:34] to hunting his tree stand never got to
[6:38] hunt on the property but he took me
[6:40] I always felt kind of special that he
[6:43] took me in so and so we we we've been
[6:47] that kind of a friend through the years
[6:49] and and it was in the August camp that
[6:53] if you'll remember it was that I believe
[6:56] it was a Wednesday night service that
[6:58] the Lord had just done some very special
[7:01] things
[7:02] I told him I said if if I could just
[7:04] operate behind a curtain to where man
[7:07] couldn't see it or or nobody could hear
[7:10] my voice but just see the Lord Jesus
[7:12] that's what I would really like to see
[7:14] take place and as it would be there
[7:17] would be a circle that would come to the
[7:20] altar and we would pray for them and
[7:21] then after the service
[7:23] brother brother Matthew here and and and
[7:26] then brother Alden was just a faithful
[7:29] deacon he just came and they were they
[7:31] would meet me at the curtain and take me
[7:33] to the office and and I changed my
[7:36] clothes and get ready to leave and and
[7:38] so and so I as I was going through the
[7:43] curtains you know when I went through
[7:45] the curtain like I begin to just feel
[7:47] that feeling and we begin to one after
[7:50] another begin to have prayer with them
[7:52] and brother Nathaniel Greene being one
[7:55] and his wife Caitlin and and then and
[7:57] then there was a couple more that was
[7:59] standing there it would be the night to
[8:02] which that also brother
[8:05] gido if you know the story about brother
[8:08] Dido and brother Dido as he's coming and
[8:11] he's watching these things take place
[8:13] brother ghido says as he's standing it
[8:16] is just coming his arms stretched out
[8:17] like this and I begin to tell him
[8:19] brother ghido I see trouble coming for
[8:22] you and he's and and then a couple other
[8:25] things that came and then brother ghido
[8:27] there's a train that's coming and her to
[8:29] be okay for you to get on even in that
[8:33] then brother Dewayne Jackson and his
[8:36] wife was standing there just had prayed
[8:38] for her only moments ago but now I
[8:40] called brother Dewayne to pray for him
[8:43] and and I began to talk to him you've
[8:46] been running from a call for 17 years
[8:49] and then I begin to speak to him about
[8:51] total commitment to God and you know the
[8:55] just presence of the Lord came I don't
[8:58] know exactly the sequence of it all but
[9:00] Terry was standing there brother Alden
[9:02] was was there and Terry was standing
[9:05] there and he was just watching all that
[9:07] happen and tears running down out of his
[9:09] eyes and when I came to hear
[9:11] he said I can serve a god like that and
[9:18] he looked at me said brother Owen I need
[9:20] prayer and I just bundled him up he's a
[9:24] man built much like me and I just
[9:26] bundled him up in my arms and I begin to
[9:29] pray with him and I just felt him just
[9:31] heaving and tears and and just just
[9:35] giving his whole life to Jesus Christ
[9:39] sister Betty told me she said he was
[9:43] coming to meet her to take her home and
[9:45] they were going out the back because she
[9:47] was playing the organ and as they would
[9:50] leave out and she told me she said he
[9:54] was different
[9:55] from the moment he left you said I
[9:59] walked out of that building with a
[10:00] different man brother Andrew would speak
[10:05] to him just only a few weeks later and
[10:07] and he would talk to her and he says I
[10:09] met him that night
[10:11] I met him that night and and he would
[10:15] begin to tell him service because a few
[10:17] weeks later he would find out he had
[10:19] cancer and he's in between his lungs and
[10:22] he said you know I'm not I'm not scared
[10:25] of them of the cancer though I have no
[10:27] fear of that but I really hate to leave
[10:29] my wife none of us want to do that none
[10:34] of us wanted to leave the other morning
[10:37] need they had went out to get a little
[10:40] bite to eat and with some friends and
[10:42] they came home and did like a lot of us
[10:45] do that sat down on Sunday evenings and
[10:48] they sat down and they set in their easy
[10:50] chairs and sit there and and they just
[10:54] drifted off to sleep and about 1 o'clock
[10:56] in the morning that woke up and and so
[11:00] we ought to go to bed I don't know if
[11:02] many of you guys do that we we can't do
[11:04] that sometimes and so they they made
[11:07] ready to go to bed and sister Betty was
[11:09] making her way to bed and brother tape
[11:11] Terry was cutting off all the lights and
[11:13] and as he was laying down he he
[11:17] he sometimes couldn't breathe well and
[11:19] so he he'd said he's set up and and he
[11:22] coughed him and I won't go into it but
[11:25] he coughed and he said Betty get 9-1-1
[11:29] just a few moments he went home to be
[11:32] with the Lord they called me the next
[11:34] morning and talked to me about it and I
[11:37] told them I said I could come if you
[11:40] know if you want me to come and so they
[11:42] invited me they wanted me to preach the
[11:44] funeral yesterday and I would say in
[11:47] attendance it was probably only brother
[11:51] homers funeral would be larger than then
[11:54] Darius and if you could have set him
[11:56] probably couldn't have set them all in
[11:58] the parking lot and yeah it was just you
[12:02] know when a man is a friend to everybody
[12:04] in and he's always been a buddy and been
[12:08] that kind of a guy and he got a lot of
[12:10] friends a lot of workers that had came
[12:12] there a lot of a lot of family members
[12:15] that was there and then they started at
[12:18] 11 o'clock in' and so they allowed us to
[12:21] start the funeral at 2:00 and friends
[12:24] were still coming and I just thought it
[12:27] was just I thought I'd just take a
[12:29] moment to share with you we don't
[12:31] realize in life we don't realize in life
[12:35] how quickly it all comes and how it goes
[12:39] brother out and just said something to
[12:41] me just a moment ago it that he's given
[12:43] thought to he said had he came and spit
[12:46] there and just kind of slipped on maybe
[12:49] just slipped on to the car he too missed
[12:52] his opportunity I don't want to miss my
[12:55] opportunity when Jesus comes by I think
[13:01] sometimes God has eternal purposes that
[13:03] he wants to do and so we just thank the
[13:06] Lord and I think a what an incredible
[13:08] miracle that was and I think now brother
[13:11] Dwayne Jackson I think he's preached
[13:13] about ten sermons now since that night
[13:16] but the ghido has went to be with the
[13:19] Lord in a complete surprise only only
[13:22] just a little bit before he's playing
[13:24] with his grandchildren they're up on his
[13:26] edie he's reading the paper and they're
[13:29] just milling around his head like any
[13:30] grandpa would do and they're shuffling
[13:33] his hair and you know he's playing and
[13:35] they're done and in a few moments he's
[13:37] going to be with the Lord we don't know
[13:40] we don't know it's not about what we
[13:44] attained in this life it's not about
[13:48] what we attain in this life or what we
[13:50] own in this life it's about who we meet
[13:53] and in that special moment in a manner
[13:58] IIIi think of all of those things and as
[14:01] I would stand here this evening I I just
[14:04] I just think oh god help me to be at the
[14:07] right place at the right time a manner
[14:11] so we just thank you for your sharing us
[14:13] last night now Andrew did an awesome job
[14:15] we listened to the songs sung and the
[14:18] preaching as it was preached and I I
[14:20] just so enjoyed that with all of our
[14:22] hearts and I was driving up the road and
[14:25] a Manning with you and sister Connie was

[14:36] home last night about 11:30 and we left
[14:40] after the cookie exchange and we drove
[14:43] into the night night I think we got in
[14:45] bed about 2 o'clock and then got up yet
[14:47] Sunday morning Saturday morning and and
[14:51] I got ready for the funeral and and then
[14:55] drove home and got home last night about
[14:57] 11:00 11:30 probably 11:30 as type thing
[14:59] and and tried to get to bed and and then
[15:02] I have to be honest we've got slept in a
[15:04] little bit this morning and Amen kind of

[15:53] present for us and it's wrapped wrapped
[15:57] in humanity so we've invited brother

[16:43] to our feet
[16:48] hey one thing about it we'll try to get
[16:51] you as much exercise here at churches
[16:53] you can get you and so amen we love you
[16:55] with all of our hearts Saint John
[16:58] chapter 5 and verse 31
[17:15] glad I'm still standing aren't you after
[17:17] Andrews sermon last night um I still
[17:20] believe Amen I believe you believe why
[17:27] brother Branham said I could preach to
[17:29] believers all night so maybe a man
[17:32] how many still believers amen god bless
[17:36] you st. John chapter 5 in verse 31 if I
[17:43] bear witness of myself my witness is not
[17:45] true therefore there is another that
[17:51] beareth witness of me and I know that
[17:54] the witness which he witnesses of me is
[17:58] true you sent unto John and he bear
[18:02] witness unto the truth but I receive not
[18:06] testimony from man but these things I
[18:10] say that you might be saved he was a
[18:14] burning and shining light and you were
[18:17] willing for a season to rejoice in his
[18:22] light you were willing for a season to
[18:26] rejoice in his light it's quite a
[18:28] statement in it you enjoyed his message
[18:31] for a while but I have a greater witness
[18:35] than that of John for the works which
[18:39] the father hath given me to finish the
[18:43] same works that I do bear witness of me
[18:46] that the father hath sent me and the
[18:50] father himself which hath sent me hath
[18:52] borne witness of me and you have neither
[18:55] heard his voice at any time nor seen his
[18:58] shape and ye have not his word abiding
[19:02] you in you for whom he hath sent him you
[19:08] believe not search the Scriptures for in
[19:14] them you think you have eternal life and
[19:17] they are they which testify of me
[19:20] and you cannot come to me that ye might
[19:26] have life a man I want to read this I
[19:32] think it was read last night Hebrews
[19:34] chapter 11 and verse 1 now faith is the
[19:39] substance of things hoped for the
[19:43] evidence of things not seen for by it
[19:47] the elders obtained a good report
[19:49] through faith we understand that the
[19:52] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[19:55] that the things which are not were not
[19:59] saying are saying were not made of
[20:02] things which do appear let's talk to the
[20:05] Lord just now Almighty God we love you
[20:08] with all of our hearts this evening and
[20:11] we bow our heads before you to the dust
[20:13] which we came and we want to remember
[20:15] her sister Betty and her family and Lord
[20:19] sister Tanya the boys there we pray that
[20:22] you would just bring them strength today
[20:24] many needs that are going on even around
[20:27] the world we pray that you would touch
[20:28] them and strengthen us may you anoint
[20:31] these words this evening father
[20:33] touch Lord bring strength to those that
[20:35] are even listening now I pray that you'd
[20:38] stretch forth your hand of mercy do a
[20:40] supernatural work we pray in Jesus
[20:43] Christ's name we ask a man and an a man
[20:47] and a man god bless you you may be
[20:48] seated
[20:52] I'd like to just take for a thought that
[20:56] his purpose might stand our purpose will
[21:01] not stand too long our energies will not
[21:04] last long but God is a determined God
[21:11] God is very determined
[21:15] hebrews chapter 11 and III just like to
[21:18] just take a through few thoughts here
[21:20] just for a little bit
[21:21] hebrews chapter 11 you'll turn there
[21:26] with me Hebrews 11 I can just I can only
[21:47] fathom the thought of what it was like
[21:50] when Paul was writing this script as
[21:54] he's laying it out of each my faith and
[21:58] my faith and by faith and by faith
[22:01] Abraham and by faith Moses and and each
[22:04] one of them by faith a lot of things
[22:07] were unseen a lot of things were dropped
[22:10] into them by revelation and they grabbed
[22:13] ahold of it and held on it and they
[22:15] became passionate and they gave their
[22:17] very life for it the scripture and I
[22:20] pick it up in verse 31 and by faith the
[22:23] harlot Rahab perish not with them which
[22:28] believe not when she had received the
[22:33] spies with peace here was a woman that
[22:37] caught the message of the hour and her
[22:40] entire city her entire city was
[22:45] literally destroyed with me now
[22:49] thousands upon tens of thousands of
[22:52] people we don't have an exact count
[22:53] there but thousands upon tens of
[22:56] thousands the spice it came in and sawed
[22:59] how it was laid out but there was a
[23:02] promise of God his purpose was getting
[23:06] ready to stand and here's one woman with
[23:10] an occupation of being a harlot but a
[23:14] predestinated seed on the inside of her
[23:18] it didn't bother God her occupation he
[23:24] was not ashamed
[23:25] they knew she was in him before the
[23:28] foundation of the world and this woman
[23:32] literally in a few years is going to be
[23:35] a woman that is married in an incredible
[23:39] situation but at this point she's
[23:42] identified as a heretic I wonder how
[23:46] many of us had some pretty bad history
[23:50] to which that we don't even want to talk
[23:52] about tonight but God rich in mercy
[23:55] bypassed our original purpose what we
[24:01] thought we'd do and what we were doing
[24:04] and how we destroyed her life listen a
[24:10] lot of bad that we had done in our lives
[24:12] but God rich in mercy and the walls were
[24:18] crumbling around her and she had a
[24:21] promise when this city falls we're still
[24:26] going to be here when everybody dies
[24:30] around us we're going to overcome we're
[24:34] going to be preserved I'd say this view
[24:39] we live in and this layout of seeing
[24:42] darkness and chaos and immorality and
[24:45] terrible turmoil let the world fall
[24:48] apart because it's supposed to listen
[24:56] it's coming to its end
[24:58] with me it's coming to its end but that
[25:02] end that's got laman the scripture said
[25:05] it's a great and dreadful day of the
[25:08] Lord when more I save for the time would
[25:14] fail me of Gideon and Bay Ark and of
[25:18] Samson and Jeff and I and and of David

[28:33] valued to turn to flight the armies of
[28:36] the aliens women received their dead
[28:39] raised to life again others were
[28:42] tortured not accepting deliverance that
[28:46] they might obtain a better resurrection

[28:51] scourgings yay moreover bonds and
[28:53] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[28:58] sawn asunder how many's had at that kind
[29:02] of day that's not our age we're not
[29:07] being stoned with stones we're not being
[29:10] sawn asunder we're not being pulled
[29:12] apart we're not being burned at the
[29:14] stake our job is to overcome Laodicea
[29:21] are you with me are you with me it's an
[29:24] age to where that churches are dying
[29:26] people are dying off people don't want
[29:29] to go to church and yet God put a desire
[29:32] inside of you that you can't wait till
[29:35] those doors come open who did that
[29:43] I say God did that that his purpose will
[29:50] stand Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1
[30:03] wherefore seeing we are so compassed
[30:06] about with with so great a cloud of
[30:09] witnesses I'm going to share a few
[30:11] things with you this evening let us lay
[30:13] aside every weight and the sin was best
[30:17] so easily beset us and let us run let us
[30:23] run with patience the race that is set
[30:25] before us looking unto our favorite
[30:29] preacher looking unto Jesus the author
[30:37] and the finisher of our faith of our
[30:42] faith who for the joy was set before him
[30:46] endured the cross despising the shame
[30:49] and has sat down at the right hand of
[30:52] the throne of God
[30:54] what powerful writing Malachi 4:5 and in
[31:01] their verse 6 behold I send you Elijah
[31:06] the Prophet before the coming of the
[31:09] Great and dreadful day of the Lord and
[31:12] he shall turned the heart of the
[31:14] father's to the children and the heart
[31:16] of the children to their fathers lest I
[31:19] come and smite the earth with a curse
[31:22] there was a day that we preach God send
[31:26] and Elijah God send and Elijah God send
[31:29] and Elijah and Elijah came
[31:32] the Pentecost frites God sending Elijah
[31:35] the Baptist preached God's ending Elijah
[31:38] Spurgeon preach God's going to send
[31:40] Elijah he warned his own ministers that
[31:44] they couldn't reveal the seven seals a
[31:47] prophet will come and do that and God
[31:50] was just as good as his word he sinned
[31:53] Elijah and Aleya he sinned Elijah we're
[32:00] not ashamed of that but he was a man
[32:03] like light passions like me and you he
[32:06] made mistakes like you and I let me just
[32:08] say this year we're not to worship
[32:10] William Branham we're not to disrespect
[32:14] him whatsoever he said I he would have
[32:19] wanted to be a trapper if given his
[32:22] purpose he would have liked him in a
[32:24] trapper
[32:25] let me just bring it back to you and I
[32:27] thought this was interesting last week
[32:29] you heard a preacher that was a trapper
[32:32] at one time when brother Kelly was a
[32:34] younger man he was a trapper that laid
[32:37] trap lines up in the northern were up in
[32:40] the northern country of Canada there and
[32:42] they would run those those schema bills
[32:46] and and they would run them and go out
[32:49] for months at a time and you know
[32:51] brother Kelly the way he conducts
[32:52] himself never looks like the kind of guy
[32:54] that would that would be out there on
[32:56] the trap lines and and and and sleeping
[32:59] on that cold ground and building those
[33:01] pelts and building it together and spend
[33:04] months at a time and then when your
[33:06] snowmobile breaks down you walk for just
[33:08] tens of miles and and have to get parts
[33:11] and come back and redo it all over and
[33:13] just spend the whole time and but you
[33:15] see it was God was building a man that's
[33:19] what brother Branham wanted to be he
[33:20] wanted to be a trapper he wanted to do
[33:22] those things but God had a higher
[33:24] calling for him he had a higher calling
[33:27] for you many of us were the nominal
[33:30] people and many were in there skipping
[33:33] the denomination feeling that they were
[33:34] right but one day
[33:39] one day what you were listening to was
[33:42] not enough
[33:44] sitting in a Pew of going you know in
[33:46] the same ritual over and over again and
[33:49] you look around and there's no life here
[33:51] where's the life that and then just
[33:54] something begin to brood over you like
[33:57] an eagle calling somebody handed you a
[34:02] book somebody told you about a story
[34:04] somebody invited you to church maybe
[34:06] walked into this church saying I'll
[34:08] never come back again
[34:09] but you knew that there was life to that
[34:14] you felt that little something and
[34:16] that's something just kept pulling it's
[34:19] a song said something keeps holding me
[34:27] I'd like to say this that we're not
[34:29] holding herself
[34:36] I'm really glad of that to Luke for 17
[34:43] and verse 30 Jesus is standing there and
[34:46] he says even that shall it be and that
[34:49] day when the Son of Man is revealed
[34:52] so we've lived in the day of the
[34:55] revealing of who Jesus Christ really is
[34:57] oh we've had the Bible for many many
[35:00] years now people have fought and died
[35:03] over heaven the print of the Bible
[35:04] arguments have taken place which Bible
[35:06] is correct but in this day it has become
[35:12] an open book to us and we've seen Jesus
[35:16] Christ that is among us even now and in
[35:20] that day which shall be he shall be upon
[35:23] the housetop and and his stuff in the
[35:25] house let him not come down to take it
[35:27] away and he that is afield let him not
[35:29] class not to return back and Jesus says
[35:32] three words here that it's always
[35:34] astounding remember Lot's wife we do not
[35:39] want to be identified with her
[35:42] that even angels came to her house and
[35:45] and brought them out of Sodom and
[35:48] brought them out and and and they didn't
[35:52] go back to where Abraham was but as they
[35:54] came out Lot's wife turned and looked
[35:59] back she turned and looked back remember
[36:04] this the scripture says that when a man
[36:08] puts his hand on the plow and he turns
[36:10] and he looks back he's not fit for the
[36:15] kingdom of heaven I want to be fit I
[36:21] want to be fit I want to say this year
[36:25] there's nothing in this world there's
[36:32] nothing in this world that I have seen
[36:34] and I've seen some very special things
[36:37] in life I've been in some really
[36:39] interesting places there's nothing here
[36:43] I want to stay for Hollywood gives you a
[36:52] picture of how life ought to be really
[36:57] really and then make a movie together
[37:00] and then they fall in love and they
[37:01] leave their wives and then they go make
[37:04] another movie together and they fall in
[37:06] love and they divorce this one to marry
[37:08] this one for a little island and stars
[37:11] become rock stars and country stars and
[37:14] before long you find out there living
[37:15] secret lives it's no reality to it I
[37:18] heard brother Andrew talk about an
[37:21] unreal world in and this world that's in
[37:24] the imagination and the games and the
[37:26] things people are so caught up and the
[37:30] world is so caught up as hell they're
[37:32] they're trying to live in an imaginary
[37:35] world that's not real brother branham
[37:39] would say those things are preparing
[37:40] people for a Tribulation Period
[37:47] whosoever shall seek his life to save
[37:51] his life shall lose it and whosoever
[37:54] shall lose this life or shall preserve
[37:56] it and I tell you that in that night
[37:59] there shall to be two men and in one bed
[38:01] and once you'll be taking another one
[38:03] shall be left two women grinding
[38:05] together one shall be taken another left
[38:08] two men in the field and one shall be
[38:11] taken and the other left I want to
[38:17] fulfill the part of taken are you with
[38:27] me I want to fulfill that part taking I
[38:30] don't want to show up here on the Sunday
[38:33] after the after the people leave and go
[38:37] wherever is everybody act I don't have a
[38:40] conversation with people that may be
[38:42] amiss that are standing there and going
[38:44] where they all act what a haunting
[38:50] affair would that be so we're anointed
[38:59] by Almighty God just fulfilled the
[39:02] overcome and portion in this day
[39:06] somebody's going to overcome somebody's
[39:13] going to overcome here with me now
[39:17] somebody is going to overcome somebody's
[39:22] going to be raptured I just happened to
[39:27] believe it's me
[39:39] brother branham was standing and he's
[39:42] come to the end of the service the man
[39:45] named Victor LeDoux which is he's
[39:47] standing there and he's and there's also
[39:50] French interpreters that are standing in
[39:52] the building not giving you all the
[39:53] history and he's standing there he's
[39:55] given brother Branham some cufflinks and
[39:57] these cufflinks have a have a line and a
[40:00] red line in it they're white and
[40:03] somebody was sitting two pictures or
[40:04] maybe actually seen the cufflinks but
[40:06] they have a little red line in it and
[40:09] they see standing there he's talking to
[40:11] brother Branham about this could be the
[40:13] 20/20 the next chapter of the Book of
[40:16] Revelations and when he does he begins
[40:19] to speak in tongues and this man don't
[40:21] know Fritz but he begins to speak in
[40:23] French and three people being
[40:26] interpreters all captured what this man
[40:29] said and one being a very distinguished
[40:35] interpreter and it said because thou has
[40:38] chosen the narrow path the harder way
[40:44] that was walked in your own choosing and
[40:48] I have a reason to say this eleven years
[40:50] I worked at the radford Arsenal and we
[40:55] made bombs there and I'll never forget
[40:58] we were there and I I said as a
[41:02] committeeman in the in the Union and had
[41:07] a position there one day one of the vice
[41:10] presidents wanted to be a little bit
[41:11] snide with me and and he began to begin
[41:14] to make some remarks to me and they
[41:17] began to kind of make fun of me for
[41:18] being a preacher working in a bomb
[41:20] factory
[41:22] and I guess costing me real quick them
[41:25] kind of turned these wheels just a few
[41:27] moments but this poin I I cut it out and
[41:31] I put it on my locker I put it on my
[41:35] locker and I look at it every day
[41:37] because it was more than just brother
[41:40] branham's choice
[41:42] or here anymore they just brother
[41:45] branham's choice it's our choice are you
[41:51] with me
[41:51] listen to me here we had to leave
[41:53] somewhere we left the world and we're
[41:57] here we left the opportunity is the
[42:00] world and we're here I want to read this
[42:05] again and what this become personal now
[42:07] to you and remember this lesson William
[42:09] Branham saying it about his self this
[42:11] was God saying it doing and Branham
[42:16] because thou has chosen the narrow path
[42:20] the harder way thou has walked in your
[42:25] own choosing
[42:27] thou has picked the correct and precise
[42:32] decision and it is my way because of
[42:39] this momentous decision a huge portion
[42:43] of heaven a will await thee I believe
[42:48] I'm part of that I believe I'm part of
[42:52] that what a glorious decision thou hast
[42:56] made hallelujah let me just say this
[43:02] year we want to hear well done down here
[43:04] and we love to be encouraged down here
[43:06] but I can't wait to hear that from God
[43:09] [Music]
[43:10] what a glorious decision thou hast made
[43:14] this in itself it's that which will give
[43:19] and make to come to pass the tremendous
[43:22] victory and the love divine
[43:35] somebody asked me the other day where
[43:40] you get that energy actually my father
[43:45] said this to me on Friday evening he
[43:51] said where do you get that energy to do
[43:55] this and just stay so busy and go in
[43:57] here he said how do you keep all of that
[43:59] straight in your mind he said how do you
[44:02] go from this to this to this this and
[44:04] and you just and and it's just going on
[44:07] and he says he said hey I just I kind of
[44:11] have trouble having breakfast and then
[44:12] going feeding the cows I said bad were
[44:18] driven something on the inside of us
[44:24] we're driven for a purpose this ain't no
[44:31] time to relaxing and sit back this is
[44:34] our opportunity I want to challenge you
[44:38] tonight this is our opportunity God
[44:44] place to drive on the inside of us and
[44:46] he placed the seal a seal of burden a
[44:52] real burden on the inside of us to carry
[44:57] God's word this audience has a burden
[45:03] for the bright around the world and a
[45:08] vision to help others that others can
[45:11] have a opportunity to hear the same
[45:13] message that you hear all of this will
[45:19] be accomplished I think about the
[45:22] accomplishment that men has made and
[45:24] brother Branham talks about every
[45:27] generation must have its own revival
[45:29] talks about the cycle of passion of life
[45:32] and death in every every generation it
[45:35] seems to get weaker as it goes on even
[45:38] in a church that seems like the next
[45:40] generation if they're not careful it
[45:42] Falls and it fails away and the next
[45:44] generation gets worse and worse
[45:46] the next generation gets worse and
[45:49] there's a dying and if it's only a
[45:51] denomination the next generation don't
[45:53] look like the original but what's
[45:58] different about this place what's
[46:01] different about this place we have come
[46:04] we came through a couple of generations
[46:06] now give it a few more days the pathan
[46:09] will be handed to the next pastor well
[46:12] he wants me but this church is not
[46:14] regressing with me we're pressing
[46:19] forward all along we're pressing flowers
[46:28] [Applause]
[46:32] with me
[46:34] I heard Andrew preaching last night and
[46:38] I thought about it here then I was
[46:40] driving up the road better than 70 miles
[46:43] an hour and I'm listening to the service
[46:45] and and I I'm just listening and I'm
[46:48] thinking in my mind I can't be there I'd
[46:50] love to be there but God you made a way
[46:53] you made a way I didn't put that gift
[46:59] there God put that gift there you made a
[47:02] way Gladys a provider are you with me
[47:06] now remember this jesus said in our in
[47:10] Revelation chapter 3 and verse 20 behold
[47:13] I stand at the door and knock
[47:15] remember what brother Brandon said about
[47:17] this quotation this is the first time
[47:19] that God is on the outside of the church
[47:23] knocking the church has put him outside
[47:31] he's no longer welcome to run the church
[47:35] but a governing body of a man as is
[47:40] governing the church and Jesus is on the
[47:43] outside
[47:45] and they've taken the scriptures and
[47:47] made them an on effect and said it's not
[47:50] inspired or we don't use that no more
[47:52] and just begin to explain away the
[47:55] supernatural buying prayers and buying
[47:59] obeisance and buying different things
[48:01] and before long generations become
[48:04] blinded
[48:05] before long sin contaminates the church
[48:08] and sin contaminates the pulpits
[48:14] it would be interesting if Elijah was
[48:17] here today what he would say brother
[48:24] Andrew used a word last night as a very
[48:27] difficult word word called bastard and
[48:30] that's that's a child that doesn't
[48:34] recognize his father doesn't have father
[48:36] and I and brother branham would call it
[48:38] that kind of a generation that we're
[48:40] living in an illegitimate generation and
[48:43] I'd say if he looked around that our
[48:46] government in our church world and the
[48:49] music and all that different kind of
[48:51] things if he would thought 65 was bad
[48:55] [Applause]
[48:57] brother Jason I'd say he would literally
[49:04] that ought to give us our CEO like never
[49:06] before to be on fire God don't let my
[49:13] fire go
[49:16] [Music]
[49:25] now let let me just say this to you how
[49:28] does the fire go out well if you were
[49:29] hunting and out in the mountains and you
[49:32] wanted to put your fire out at night you
[49:34] just start separating the coals you just
[49:39] start separating the coals and after a
[49:41] while this cold will roll over here
[49:43] it'll start to get cold and after a
[49:46] while you'll see the redness leave it
[49:49] after a while it'll be it'll be just a
[49:52] coal black clump of where fire used to
[49:57] be at listen you lay out of church a few
[50:03] times and for they say not the
[50:08] assembling of yourselves together just
[50:10] stop praying a lot just just stop
[50:16] listening to the message of the IRA
[50:17] Walla what I just come to church even if
[50:20] you come to church and just kind of fold
[50:21] your arms and sit there before long
[50:31] they're just like a cold that has been
[50:33] rolled off to the side a little bit why
[50:36] I didn't get nothing out of church what
[50:38] did you put in
[50:42] [Applause]
[50:53] you listen me
[50:55] we expect the minister to preach a
[50:57] masterpiece every service we really do
[51:02] we expect to we expect the singer to
[51:04] never hit a sour note ER musicians to
[51:07] always spend on perfect time
[51:11] maybe maybe Matthew or Andrew doesn't
[51:15] get to get though I can say that about
[51:17] them and maybe they don't get the the
[51:20] tone just right or the melody just right
[51:22] and you're you're going you know I wish
[51:24] they'd just get it together
[51:34] well maybe maybe you know brother
[51:37] Andrews the triangles preacher
[51:38] somebody's trying to preach and you're
[51:41] going wow I've heard this 20 times
[51:43] before yeah I just kind of wish they get
[51:46] somewhere get somewhere with this
[51:53] somebody said something to me yesterday
[51:55] about a critic and they said well you
[51:58] know are you aren't you worried about
[51:59] what they say and I just look like I
[52:05] look to the deacon that was talking to
[52:06] him and I said have they ever won one
[52:08] soul have they ever won one soul to
[52:14] Christ heaven had they ever really
[52:17] effectively preached one sermon and you
[52:22] want to write an 80-page book to tell me
[52:26] where I'm wrong I'll tell you get over
[52:32] yourself
[52:34] don't do something for Christ
[52:47] are you with me
[52:49] we got a quotation for brother Donnie
[52:51] Ragan little this week that I thought it
[52:54] was just applica lie I thought I'm gonna
[52:55] hang on to that because they didn't want
[52:59] the New Testament that came generations
[53:03] that literally tried to go back and say
[53:05] that Pontius Pilate never lived they
[53:10] spent centuries trying to disprove the
[53:14] Bible saying Pontius Pilate never lived
[53:20] they spent their whole life trying to
[53:23] prove he never lived so that they could
[53:26] disprove the Bible do you know about ten
[53:30] years ago they found the stone that
[53:33] Pontius Pilate signed so they spent
[53:39] hundreds of years trying to prove he
[53:43] didn't live and they wasted their entire
[53:50] life trying to prove that this Bible's
[53:56] wrong a lot of people who spend their
[54:02] entire life what trying to fight brother
[54:04] Branham when he's dead gone and gone
[54:08] they'll spend their life trying to fight
[54:10] men like brother Homer fight men like me
[54:12] or fight men all over the world and
[54:14] they'll spend their life and it's gone
[54:16] and they become nothing nothing even

[58:06] servant of God a cold drink of water you
[58:08] get a reward this is going to get a
[58:12] reward one day
[58:24] sure there's a lot of darkness in the
[58:27] world but there's lights there's light
[58:31] that is here i don'ts mean that is a
[58:36] reflection to anybody brother on you're
[58:38] throwing a stone at me if it hits you
[58:41] this was the spot to get it fixed
[58:45] brother are not offends me here's the
[58:48] spot to get it fits not at the white
[58:50] throne judgment while there's still life
[58:54] on the inside of you get it fixed give
[58:58] your heart to God
[58:59] don't waste another day don't waste

[59:07] life for Jesus Christ
[59:27] a few months we'll go to Japan where
[59:44] there's a handful of believers that are
[59:45] catching the fire of God then we'll go
[59:48] to the Philippines and within just a
[59:51] couple of days then back to Japan again
[59:56] to preach a meeting they're already
[1:00:00] getting incredible response that's going
[1:00:02] to go on their mother on why put your
[1:00:05] life in jeopardy I'll never see that
[1:00:08] person but somebody spent the time to
[1:00:11] get you somebody spent the time to get
[1:00:17] you the scripture says but in the days
[1:00:22] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:00:26] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[1:00:27] God should be finished as he has
[1:00:30] declared unto his servants the prophets
[1:00:32] that's been fulfilled no need to try to
[1:00:36] fight that that's been fulfilled and the
[1:00:39] voice which I heard from heaven spake
[1:00:41] unto me again and said go and take the
[1:00:44] book which is open it's open its open in
[1:00:51] the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:00:53] upon the sea and upon the earth and I
[1:00:55] went into the angel said unto me give me
[1:00:57] the little book and he said take it and
[1:00:59] eat it and it shall make that belly
[1:01:02] bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet
[1:01:06] as honey and I took the little book out
[1:01:08] of the Angels hand and ate it and it was
[1:01:10] in my mouth sweet as honey in the
[1:01:11] sinners I had eaten it
[1:01:13] my belly was bitter it cleared my life
[1:01:17] of all the inconsistencies because God
[1:01:21] wants more than a Bible in your hands he
[1:01:24] wants the life in your heart
[1:01:28] [Applause]
[1:01:32] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:01:35] again before many peoples and nations
[1:01:38] and tongues and kings but the man has a
[1:01:42] quotation that we read from literally
[1:01:45] you hear it almost all the time he comes
[1:01:47] right in the middle of them and would
[1:01:49] just pick up right just a just a just a
[1:01:51] part of it
[1:01:52] he says that he knows that if the people
[1:01:55] get the true revelation of the true
[1:01:58] church and what she is and what she
[1:02:01] stands for that she can do the greater
[1:02:06] works she will be an invincible army I'm
[1:02:12] not looking for a church coming it's
[1:02:14] here we're people of Destiny what people
[1:02:21] of God's purpose we're people of God's
[1:02:24] crowning achievement hallelujah are you
[1:02:31] with me now though we see the hand of
[1:02:34] God being manifested among us we have
[1:02:37] become a lived voices lift voices
[1:02:43] annoying it to fulfill under the
[1:02:48] influence of their the mighty angel
[1:02:51] overcoming in this day when it seems
[1:02:54] like nobody can stand forgive me it
[1:02:58] seems like nobody can stand
[1:03:02] everything's been shaken that can be
[1:03:06] shaken but God's got a hook of our lives
[1:03:10] he has pre-planned there's going to be
[1:03:12] some overcomers he's pre-planned us to
[1:03:17] overcome we have been ordained
[1:03:20] we have been elected and we have been
[1:03:22] placed to live in this day and God's got
[1:03:25] work for us to do
[1:03:29] I'd like to declare to you that the my
[1:03:33] expectation is the rapture
[1:03:37] I'd get up every morning my expectation
[1:03:41] is the rapture it don't happen today
[1:03:44] I'll be looking for it tomorrow that'll
[1:03:46] happen tomorrow I'll be looking for it
[1:03:48] the next day I don't know about you but
[1:03:50] sometimes I wake up disappointed that
[1:03:52] I'm still here
[1:03:54] we come out of incredible services and
[1:03:57] we go home literally feels like the
[1:03:59] rapture is happening around us we go to
[1:04:02] bed and we wake up and it's another
[1:04:04] morning and I just kind of go sometimes
[1:04:07] go through the house well we're still
[1:04:08] here this is another day to overcome so
[1:04:17] we realize it's brother Tim Pruett
[1:04:19] preached here we are people of an open
[1:04:22] book we realize that we are people of
[1:04:26] 1st Thessalonians 4:13 we're remaining
[1:04:30] we are consistent we're remaining and if
[1:04:34] our time runs out and we go by the way
[1:04:36] of the grave
[1:04:39] we heard it last week
[1:04:43] hey you know great go hold my body down
[1:04:50] I'm gonna take a little liberty here

[1:05:14] heart to sing it and then there was some
[1:05:17] apprehension as a matter of fact I

[1:05:25] things that's sacred

[1:05:28] that now we may not get it right I just
[1:05:30] don't I don't feel nothing no another

[1:05:36] then listen to it again and sister
