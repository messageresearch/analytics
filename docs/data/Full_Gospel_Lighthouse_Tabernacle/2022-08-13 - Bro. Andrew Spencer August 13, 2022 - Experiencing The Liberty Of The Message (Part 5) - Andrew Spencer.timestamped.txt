[20:36] offering you give as god's bless you and
[20:38] after you've given you can be seated
[21:15] real quick before i sing um i was
[21:17] speaking with brother ron and brother
[21:18] andrew earlier in the week
[21:20] and uh we're just talking about things
[21:22] we've been through in our lives and
[21:23] what's been going on
[21:25] i haven't told a lot of people here
[21:27] everything that we went through
[21:29] when my son was born
[21:31] little elijah when he was in the womb we
[21:34] went and had an ultrasound done
[21:36] doing the anatomy scan
[21:38] and they informed us at that time
[21:42] that they couldn't see the proper
[21:44] formation of his arm and his leg
[21:46] and they were quite concerned at that
[21:48] time
[21:49] they were not really giving us much
[21:51] information and as parents we were we
[21:53] were scared
[21:55] um we didn't really know what to think
[21:56] it was on a friday
[21:59] we went and talked to the doctors while
[22:00] we were there again still not a lot of
[22:02] hope
[22:03] so they said we wanted to schedule us to
[22:05] go to a bigger hospital and do a more
[22:08] thorough scan to determine what was
[22:10] going on but again they weren't telling
[22:12] us anything about his arm or his leg
[22:13] other than it wasn't developing right
[22:16] they said possible
[22:20] i can't remember the words they used but
[22:21] basically he wasn't growing properly
[22:24] and possibility of down syndrome things
[22:26] like that
[22:27] so
[22:28] we went we left the doctor's office we
[22:30] called a lot of people that we knew
[22:32] um i called my parents we called our
[22:34] pastor talked to them you know we just
[22:36] asked everybody to pray because we were
[22:38] we were scared in ourselves we there was
[22:40] nothing we could do other than pray
[22:42] and you know we all believe god can take
[22:44] care of things he can handle every
[22:46] situation that comes at him
[22:48] so sunday we had prayer at church
[22:51] on monday we went to the bigger hospital
[22:53] to have the scans done
[22:56] and they took us into the room and
[22:59] first the doctor told us she's like you
[23:01] know with these things going on
[23:02] we want to talk about possible
[23:04] termination
[23:06] and i looked at him and i said no i said
[23:08] that's that's not that's not where we
[23:10] are
[23:11] i say god can take care of this
[23:13] and you know she talked her whole thing
[23:15] and then we went to the room that
[23:17] brought us up on the big scans
[23:19] and the first picture that came up
[23:23] was his arm
[23:24] they said wasn't developing right
[23:26] i seen his hand i seen all his fingers
[23:28] seeing everything
[23:30] the next picture they turned them
[23:32] i seen his legs
[23:34] they said he will you know he's going to
[23:36] have club feet
[23:37] he's going to be dealing with all these
[23:39] things
[23:40] and they're like well you know we might
[23:42] be okay
[23:44] and i said no he's going to be fine
[23:46] you know god did this for us he showed
[23:49] us that
[23:50] he was going to be okay
[23:52] so we went through the whole pregnancy
[23:54] we had extra scans done all along they
[23:56] kept talking about this could happen
[23:58] that could happen
[24:00] and we just kept praying and believing
[24:01] that god was going to take control of
[24:02] everything
[24:04] when he was born
[24:06] he did have a club foot on one of his
[24:08] feet
[24:09] the doctor said you know he's going to
[24:11] be limited
[24:13] we'll have to put him in a cast we're
[24:14] going to have to put him on these shoes
[24:16] to wear for
[24:17] two years and then have to monitor it
[24:19] and all these other things
[24:21] and
[24:22] you know we took it but we knew god was
[24:24] going to take care of everything
[24:26] he
[24:27] i don't remember exactly how long they
[24:29] said he was going to have to wear the
[24:30] cast but it was less than half the time
[24:33] and they took him out of the cast
[24:35] they put him in these special shoes that
[24:38] had a bar in between them and he
[24:40] couldn't move his feet
[24:41] they want to strengthen his turn his
[24:44] foot
[24:45] and it was less than half the time again
[24:49] that they said
[24:50] okay he's going way ahead of schedule
[24:53] and i told him and i said that's just
[24:54] god he's taking care of everything yes
[24:57] we got to go through this battle but
[24:59] god's got everything
[25:01] and you know if we went to the next
[25:03] stage the next stage and they're like
[25:05] all right well we're gonna have to just
[25:06] wear it at night for the next few years
[25:09] well that only lasted a few months
[25:12] and then we went into the doctor they
[25:14] had him walk around
[25:16] his foot looks fine
[25:17] there's nothing wrong with him
[25:19] my boy is is happy he's healthy
[25:22] you know he he does all the sports he
[25:24] wants to do he's in karate it's just
[25:27] we give all the glory to god because he
[25:29] completely
[25:30] handled everything that we
[25:32] we at one point thought was impossible
[25:35] we were in that storm in that battle and
[25:38] all we did was pray
[25:40] and it was it was a test of our faith
[25:43] and you know
[25:45] we could have just we could have gave up
[25:47] but that's not what god said to do he
[25:48] said trust and believe
[25:50] and i'll be with you
[25:52] and he's been in his life and guided him
[25:54] and helped him though since he before he
[25:56] was born
[25:57] he's been dealing with elijah and
[26:00] helping him get through this and now he
[26:02] don't even remember except for now i
[26:03] told him again
[26:05] but you know he's just he's perfect
[26:07] there's nothing wrong with him i just
[26:08] want to tell everybody and put it out
[26:10] there you know
[26:11] even if the doctors say nothing can't be
[26:13] done
[26:15] god can handle everything
[26:26] in the eye of the storm
[26:29] you remain in control
[26:32] in the middle of the war
[26:35] you've got my soul
[26:41] when my sails are torn
[26:44] your love surrounds me
[26:48] in the eye of the storm
[26:51] when a solid ground is falling out from
[26:55] underneath my feet
[26:57] between the black skies and my red eyes
[27:01] i can barely see
[27:03] and when i
[27:05] i've been sold out by my friends and my
[27:08] family
[27:11] i can feel the rain reminding me
[27:15] that in the eye of the storm
[27:18] you remain in control
[27:21] and in the middle of the war
[27:24] you guard my soul
[27:27] are you alone on the anchor
[27:30] when my cells are torn
[27:34] love surrounds me
[27:36] in the eye of a storm
[27:40] and when my hopes and dreams are far
[27:42] from me and i'm running out of faith
[27:46] i see the future
[27:48] i picture
[27:49] it slowly fades away
[27:52] and when the tears are painted hearty
[27:55] they're pouring down my face
[27:59] i find my peace in jesus name
[28:03] in the eye of a storm
[28:06] you remain in control
[28:09] and in the middle of the war
[28:12] you guard my soul
[28:15] you alone are the anchor
[28:18] when my sails are torn
[28:21] and your love surrounds me
[28:24] in the eye of the storm
[28:28] when a test comes in and a doctor says
[28:31] you only got a few months left
[28:34] it's like a bitter pill that you're
[28:36] swallowing you can barely take a breath
[28:40] and when a sickness tries to take my
[28:42] baby away and there's nothing i can do
[28:46] but my only hope is to trust in you
[28:51] in the eye of the storm
[28:54] you remain in control
[28:59] [Music]
[29:09] your love surrounds me
[29:12] in the higher storm
[29:15] and the eye of the storm
[29:18] you remain in control
[29:21] in the middle of the war
[29:22] [Music]
[29:24] you guard my soul
[29:26] you alone are the anchor
[29:30] when my cells are torn
[29:32] your love surrounds me
[29:35] in the eye of a stone
[29:38] in the eye of the storm
[29:41] and you remain in control
[29:44] in the middle of the war
[29:47] you guard my soul
[29:50] you alone are my anchor
[29:53] when my sails are torn
[29:56] your love surrounds me
[30:00] in the eye of a storm
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:19] amen aren't you glad he's your anchor
[30:23] in that storm
[30:24] amen you can sing that song before you
[30:26] go through a storm but when you really

[46:03] the circumstances of life allow us to

[47:07] living god
[47:08] we ask lord as we stand here father lord

[47:13] daughters of god may we enforce the
[47:16] claim that we've been given and father

[47:32] amen amen god bless you this evening if
[47:35] you have your bibles we'd like to look
[47:36] over in the book of hebrews
[47:39] chapter 10
[47:41] and verse 5 and then down to romans
[47:43] chapter 8
[47:45] verse 14.
[47:47] it's honored to be in the house of the
[47:49] lord
[47:50] once again
[47:52] amen
[47:56] amen
[47:57] we ask that you'd be praying for us this
[47:59] coming week as we'll be headed to
[48:02] ohio there at true word tabernacle the
[48:05] the uh camp meeting that they have the
[48:07] youth camp there
[48:08] at uh saint mary's camp and i know it's
[48:11] a youth camp and
[48:13] and i believe there's a few from the
[48:14] turks here that's going and
[48:16] and uh so we're just
[48:18] just asking that you'd be remembering us
[48:20] in prayer in those meetings that the
[48:22] that the lord would do special things
[48:25] and i sure would appreciate your prayers
[48:27] myself and brother timothy pruitt will
[48:28] be speaking that meeting again
[48:30] last last year some of the most
[48:32] supernatural events i i'd ever witnessed
[48:35] we witnessed right there and
[48:38] you know they they're they're asking us
[48:40] to come back and i'm i'm certainly
[48:42] privileged to go there and i certainly
[48:44] love brother ray and brother ray is just
[48:47] a real general and a real man of god and
[48:50] brother wayne lawson there and we're
[48:52] just uh we're just privileged to know
[48:54] these men of god and to to be a part of
[48:56] this wonderful message
[48:58] amen amen we trust you all had a
[49:00] wonderful week
[49:03] amen amen i believe i believe god's got
[49:06] something in store for us this evening
[49:10] you believe that
[49:13] before you see it or before you hear it
[49:15] you believe it
[49:17] amen
[49:18] i'd like to speak to you again i was
[49:21] thinking or looking at a different
[49:23] thought but the lord just brought us
[49:25] back to this thought on experiencing the
[49:26] liberty of the message and
[49:30] we'll just follow the leadership of the
[49:31] lord here so
[49:33] i believe i believe that
[49:35] if we're following him he'll never lead
[49:37] us into anything wrong
[49:38] amen
[49:40] amen so by the help of the lord we'd
[49:41] like to speak to you again on this song
[49:43] and experience and the liberty of the
[49:44] message
[49:45] hebrews chapter 10 and verse 5
[49:48] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[49:50] he saith sacrifice an offering thou what
[49:52] is not but a body
[49:55] a body thou hast prepared me
[49:59] amen romans chapter 8 and verse 14.
[50:14] for as many as are led by the spirit
[50:17] they are
[50:19] the sons of god can you say that you are
[50:21] a son of god
[50:23] amen
[50:24] for ye have not received the spirit of
[50:27] bondage again to fear but you have
[50:29] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[50:31] we cry
[50:32] abba father
[50:34] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[50:36] our spirit that we are the children of
[50:39] god and if children then heirs and heirs
[50:42] of god and joint heirs with christ if so
[50:44] be that we suffer with him that we may
[50:47] be also glorified together
[50:49] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[50:51] present time are not worthy to be
[50:54] compared with the glory which shall be
[50:56] revealed in us
[50:58] for the earnest expectation of the
[51:00] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[51:02] of the sons of god
[51:04] for the creature was made subject to
[51:06] vanity not willing
[51:08] not willingly but by reason of him who
[51:11] hath subjected the same in hope
[51:14] because the creature itself also
[51:17] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[51:19] corruption into the glorious liberty
[51:22] of the children of god may god bless his
[51:25] word he may be seated in the presence of
[51:26] the lord
[51:28] we we've been going over this thought
[51:29] for the last few weekends i trust that
[51:31] you're enjoying that and and it's been a
[51:33] blessing unto you but we recognize
[51:36] that that webster webster said that
[51:38] liberty it is the freedom it is a
[51:41] freedom from restraint in a gentle in a
[51:44] general sense and applicable to the body
[51:47] it is a state of exemption from the
[51:49] control
[51:50] it is an exemption from the control
[51:53] of others and a man truly enjoys a
[51:56] liberty when there is no restraints or
[51:58] there is no physical force to operate
[52:00] upon his life to restrain him or to draw
[52:03] him back and i believe that is what god
[52:05] is desiring is a body that is without
[52:08] restraint and that's what paul would
[52:10] stand there in hebrews chapter 11 and he
[52:12] would lay out those heroes of faith and
[52:15] then it turns over into chapter 12 and
[52:17] he said let us lay aside every weight
[52:20] and sin that does so easily beset us any
[52:23] of the things that would hold us back
[52:25] from truly giving our complete life over
[52:27] to jesus christ let us lay aside
[52:29] everything anything and everything that
[52:31] would hold us back from the power from
[52:34] the power of being released to the
[52:36] supernatural power of the holy ghost and
[52:38] that's what we desire in in each and
[52:40] every one of our lives no matter how far
[52:42] we've grown in the message or how far
[52:44] we've been here or how long we've been
[52:46] here i believe that every single person
[52:48] or every christian has a desire that
[52:51] they would completely lay aside
[52:52] everything and to to surrender their
[52:54] life unto him so that they can fully be
[52:57] used by the leadership of the lord in
[52:59] the areas of life that that he's
[53:01] destined for us to walk in i truly
[53:03] believe as sons and daughters of god
[53:05] that that we are to completely lay aside
[53:08] our abilities and completely lay aside
[53:10] every weight and completely lay aside
[53:12] all of our thoughts and what we think
[53:14] about life and how we think that we
[53:16] ought to go in life but we are to lay
[53:18] aside everything that would hold us back
[53:20] and and paul would go on to say let us
[53:22] run let us run within within us and you
[53:26] can't truly you can't truly run with
[53:28] this message if you're if you're holding
[53:29] on to the things of the world and and
[53:31] that's that's something that william
[53:33] branham the ministry of malachi 4. he
[53:35] would he would stand there and he would
[53:37] he would express to us especially in the
[53:39] later coming or the later years of the
[53:42] message he would stand there and he
[53:43] would place the emphasis
[53:45] of the dynamics uh in the body of jesus
[53:48] christ and he would stand there and he
[53:50] would he would preach right in front of
[53:51] those pentecostal men that would that
[53:53] would shut him down or or men that would
[53:56] be against him but he would stand there
[53:57] and he said you've got too much theology
[53:59] you've got all the mechanics on the
[54:01] theology but there's no dynamics to make
[54:03] it work and you can have all the letter
[54:05] but you don't have the spirit you you'll
[54:07] see it on it'll never work it'll never
[54:09] be indeed it'll never be exactly what
[54:11] god destined it to be you see you can
[54:14] know you can know all the scriptures you
[54:16] can know all the quotes but unless
[54:17] there's a life to back up that scripture
[54:20] or a life to push the enemy back off of
[54:22] it you see you're just you're just
[54:24] waiting in the water it might be a nice
[54:26] thing to know that that god has a chosen
[54:28] place of worship or god's provided a
[54:31] place of worship but to realize that
[54:33] that same jesus christ is dwelling on
[54:35] the inside of his bride today and that
[54:38] she alone that she is standing here in
[54:41] the midst of in the midst of chaos in
[54:43] the midst of laodicea but there is a
[54:46] chosen place of worship and that bride
[54:48] of jesus christ she's not robed in her
[54:51] own righteousness she's robed in his
[54:53] righteousness she's not standing there
[54:55] in her own mechanics but she's standing
[54:57] there in the mechanics of the word and
[54:59] the dynamics the spark of the holy ghost
[55:02] has come and set her life of fire i
[55:04] think it's an amazing thing to recognize
[55:07] and to be able to experience the true
[55:09] liberty of the message i recognize that
[55:11] that many of you came out of came out of
[55:13] denominations some of you came out of
[55:15] catholicism and some of you come out of
[55:17] productivism at protestant and you come
[55:20] out of those works or those movements of
[55:22] the world but to think about the true
[55:24] liberty that you have as sons and
[55:26] daughters of god sitting here under the
[55:29] auspices of the message of the hour i
[55:31] think what a powerful testimony that it
[55:33] is to witness that god's still getting
[55:36] his elect
[55:38] that god is still going after his seed
[55:40] and there's not there's not anything
[55:42] that can be put upon a child of god
[55:44] brother branham would say that he would
[55:45] say some of the greatest experiences
[55:47] that i've ever had in my life is when i
[55:49] couldn't see my way through it or if i
[55:51] couldn't wake my way through it that god
[55:53] would stand there and he would move that
[55:55] mountain out of our life and i think
[55:56] it's amazing thing that we could point
[55:58] back and all the roadblocks and we could
[56:01] point back at all the stepping stones
[56:03] that we've had in our life that led us
[56:05] to where we are today and if we've not
[56:07] grown in our christian walk then when
[56:09] there's something wrong but to think
[56:10] that to say today is that the same
[56:13] pillar of fire that was there with the
[56:15] children of israel it's the same pillar
[56:17] of fire that showed up and had its
[56:19] photograph taken with our prophet
[56:21] william branham it's that same pillar of
[56:23] fire that has decided to come down in
[56:26] the midst of the church of the living
[56:27] god again today and to bring us back to
[56:29] the faith of the pentecostal fathers i
[56:32] believe malachi 4 ran his race i believe
[56:35] malachi 4 laid aside everything that
[56:37] would hold him back and i think if we've
[56:40] had a prophet that would stand before us
[56:42] and give us a give us such a testimony
[56:45] how much more should the children of the
[56:48] of the living god stand here under their
[56:50] witness of the message of malachi 4 be
[56:53] able to roll their shoulders back and
[56:55] live out this message if we had a
[56:57] prophet stand before us and show us how
[56:59] to do it how much more as sons and
[57:02] daughters of god how much more shall we
[57:04] stand here under the authority of this
[57:06] message and recognize that our liberty
[57:09] has not been taken from us but our
[57:11] liberty has been given unto us we've not
[57:13] received a watered-down gospel we've not
[57:16] received a prophet that was wishy-washy
[57:18] in his thoughts we had a prophet that
[57:20] stood there and he preached the word
[57:22] whether they liked it or whether they
[57:24] didn't but i like this message just the
[57:26] way it is you don't need to change it up
[57:29] you don't need to water it down i've
[57:31] seen what it produces in our young
[57:33] people i've seen what it does to care to
[57:36] people that were paralyzed i've seen
[57:37] what it's done to babies with crippled
[57:39] feet i've seen what this message can do
[57:42] and if we're going to do anything we're
[57:44] going to stand behind the full word of
[57:45] god we're not going to take anything
[57:47] away from it because when you start
[57:49] taking away from the word of god and you
[57:51] start adding to the word of god that's
[57:53] when you remove the liberty right out of
[57:55] the message
[57:58] let's let the message be the message
[58:03] [Applause]
[58:08] brother marin would say no
[58:10] he said now the wheat alone
[58:12] it's just the wheat he said but when the
[58:14] quickening life gets into it he said
[58:16] into the wheat he said then it gives it
[58:18] life and he said when we which were once
[58:20] dead in the trespasses of our sin we
[58:23] that were made into the very images of
[58:25] almighty god he said god brother madam
[58:28] said that god had to get that quickening
[58:31] power or that quickening life in your
[58:33] mortal bodies he said i'm talking about
[58:35] your body a body the house prepared for
[58:38] me brother madam said that god had to
[58:41] get that quickening power on the inside
[58:43] of your body now to think to think that
[58:46] that it was promised he was promised a
[58:49] messiah that he would come and we know
[58:51] that the bible said that in the
[58:53] beginning was the word and the word was
[58:54] with god and the word was god is that
[58:56] right but we recognize that brother
[58:58] brandon would tell us and teach us he
[59:00] said that jesus jesus just as a man
[59:02] wasn't able to do that to go in there
[59:05] and grab those prophet's prophecies and
[59:07] make him manifest right before right
[59:09] before the church of that day but it
[59:11] took the very quickening power of
[59:13] almighty god it took the spirit of
[59:15] almighty god to come on the inside of
[59:17] jesus just like you
[59:19] you have to be fully adopted as a son
[59:22] and daughter of god you see you can
[59:24] stand there know all the scriptures have
[59:26] i stated but you could sit there and say
[59:28] well it said in mark 16 that will lay
[59:30] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[59:32] now god is obligated to keep his word
[59:35] but if you're standing there as a fully
[59:37] adopted son and daughter of god you've
[59:40] got a right to tell satan take your
[59:42] hands off of god's property you see it
[59:45] took the very life of jesus christ to
[59:48] make it manifest and make it prove
[59:50] exactly what it was
[59:52] to think that same quickening power is
[59:55] the quickening power that's got to be on
[59:56] the body of jesus christ today
[59:59] he said it's not me that doeth the works
[1:00:01] it's my father that dwelleth within me
[1:00:03] and you might come up here and somebody
[1:00:05] lay their hands upon you and you might
[1:00:07] get completely restored maybe
[1:00:09] life-changing events happen in your life
[1:00:11] but it is not the man it is the spirit
[1:00:14] of the living god that is working
[1:00:16] through that man
[1:00:17] and i'm gonna tell you what if there's
[1:00:19] one thing that i'm gonna do i'm gonna
[1:00:21] get myself out of the way and let god
[1:00:23] have his liberty god don't need my two
[1:00:25] cents god don't need my ideas god don't
[1:00:28] need my energies god just wants me to
[1:00:31] yield my vessel unto him and if i can
[1:00:33] yield my vessel unto him and let god
[1:00:35] have his liberty i'll say that the
[1:00:37] message will produce exactly what
[1:00:39] william branham preached that it would
[1:00:41] do it'll create sons
[1:00:44] it'll create daughters of god this
[1:00:46] message preached in its entirety will be
[1:00:49] exactly what paul preached exactly what
[1:00:52] peter preached
[1:00:54] that's why satan is trying to do
[1:00:56] everything within you because god satan
[1:00:58] knows that god is immutable both in his
[1:01:01] ways and in his actions and he
[1:01:03] recognizes that there is a church on
[1:01:05] earth today that is a mark 16 church in
[1:01:08] action and he recognizes that if the
[1:01:10] church of the living god catches this he
[1:01:13] will be an invincible army i'd say it's
[1:01:16] too late satan we've already received a
[1:01:19] prophet's message and that invincible
[1:01:21] army
[1:01:22] is up on her feet she's not sitting down
[1:01:25] she's not backing up but we've stood up
[1:01:28] right exactly where the message put us
[1:01:30] at
[1:01:31] [Applause]
[1:01:33] i'm sitting right here exactly where i'm
[1:01:36] supposed to be at this is the overcomers
[1:01:39] domain it's from eternity to eternity
[1:01:43] and hell don't know what to do with a
[1:01:45] believer that knows their position in
[1:01:47] jesus christ
[1:01:52] about glory
[1:01:53] [Applause]
[1:01:59] it ain't just enough
[1:02:00] to see it working in one person
[1:02:03] but working in a body
[1:02:04] it ain't just enough it ain't just
[1:02:06] enough to just to see the thumb move it
[1:02:09] ain't just enough to see the see the
[1:02:11] neck move it ain't just enough to see
[1:02:13] the hand move the body has got to be
[1:02:15] under the headship
[1:02:17] it's got to be under the intellect of
[1:02:18] the headship and when you start moving
[1:02:21] to a different room to a different
[1:02:22] groove or a different rhythm of music
[1:02:25] you're getting out of step
[1:02:27] you're getting out of cater and god does
[1:02:29] not want a church that's led by their
[1:02:31] own emotions led by their own intellects
[1:02:33] and that's where people get in trouble
[1:02:35] at is when they start putting their own
[1:02:37] intellects to the message putting their
[1:02:38] own theology to the message this message
[1:02:41] was perfect the way that it came
[1:02:44] [Applause]
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:47] let me tell you when i received the
[1:02:49] message i ain't just talking about
[1:02:50] hearing it on the tape but when the
[1:02:52] message got ahold of me it didn't come
[1:02:54] down to some watered-down thing it
[1:02:56] didn't take it easy on me it didn't say
[1:02:58] well you can do this that or the other
[1:03:00] it what's the full message
[1:03:03] it cut sin off of my life it cut
[1:03:05] sickness off of my life it was the
[1:03:08] message it was the very quickening power
[1:03:13] [Music]
[1:03:18] there's going to be any actions done in
[1:03:19] your body it's got to be christ working
[1:03:22] through your body
[1:03:25] you see when you're letting him have
[1:03:27] complete liberty in your life you are
[1:03:29] saying god
[1:03:30] you're in control of everything
[1:03:33] god you've got my finances god you've
[1:03:35] got my you've got my problems god you've
[1:03:38] got this situation this that or the
[1:03:39] other if god would work through elijah
[1:03:42] and elisha would stand there under the
[1:03:44] anointing under the anointing of christ
[1:03:47] when christ the anointing of god would
[1:03:49] come upon elijah he would stand there
[1:03:52] and god had god had given elijah a great
[1:03:54] ministry and when it come down to the
[1:03:56] jordan river when elijah was going to be
[1:03:59] taken away from elisha you remember the
[1:04:00] story
[1:04:02] and you remember you remember sitting
[1:04:04] there that elisha asked a very specific
[1:04:07] word is that right he asked for a double
[1:04:09] portion of his spirit
[1:04:11] is that right
[1:04:12] and you remember if you go to studying
[1:04:14] out you go to studying out the life of
[1:04:16] elijah and elisha they were they were
[1:04:18] under the same anointing which was
[1:04:20] christ they were under the same ministry
[1:04:23] and what was it to do
[1:04:24] it was to restore the altar and it was
[1:04:27] to restore faith is that right am i
[1:04:30] preaching to you the truth but remember
[1:04:32] when elijah asked for that double person
[1:04:34] you can look throughout elijah's life
[1:04:36] and there was eight miracles but you can
[1:04:38] look throughout elijah's life while he
[1:04:40] was living and there was 15 miracles and
[1:04:42] it looked like god had missed it or it
[1:04:44] looked like god had forgotten but there
[1:04:47] was a band of men one day that was
[1:04:49] carrying a brother they was carrying a
[1:04:51] brother that had died in the battle and
[1:04:52] they they were walking out through there
[1:04:55] and they were going down through there
[1:04:56] and they seen an army coming up they
[1:04:58] seen the enemy coming up and they threw
[1:05:00] this band they threw this soldier in
[1:05:03] that ra in that little in that little
[1:05:05] place but they didn't know where they
[1:05:07] was laying him out
[1:05:10] you see they threw that dead man into
[1:05:12] not just to any message they threw him
[1:05:14] in elijah's message
[1:05:16] and there was a promise on elijah's
[1:05:18] message that there was a double portion
[1:05:20] that would be poured out
[1:05:22] what's been poured out in this day it's
[1:05:25] not just another cloak it's the same
[1:05:27] life of jesus christ
[1:05:34] oh somebody
[1:05:37] they threw him in there on elijah's
[1:05:38] bones and they took off and running
[1:05:41] [Applause]
[1:05:44] now i wonder if we could get a testimony
[1:05:46] from a soldier real quick
[1:05:49] i wonder if we could get a testimony
[1:05:50] from a soldier boy
[1:05:52] you know i was up there i was up there

[1:06:05] or the other and it seemed like it
[1:06:06] wasn't going to get to him but it come
[1:06:08] down when william branham was singing oh

[1:07:23] any grave we threw you upon the
[1:07:25] quickening power of elijah's bones
[1:07:28] and god had remembered his promise i'll

[1:08:17] when the message came by your way and
[1:08:20] told you the very secrets of your heart
[1:08:22] he said you go back and be a real man
[1:08:24] you'll not go back to that filthy habit
[1:08:26] no more
[1:08:30] hallelujah
[1:08:34] that's why i got confidence that no

[1:08:39] deep you are no matter how lost you are
[1:08:42] you put this message on anybody as far
[1:08:44] as they are down in the pit and this
[1:08:46] message has got enough power to raise
[1:08:48] them back to life again
[1:09:00] [Music]
[1:09:05] i'm just a little
[1:09:08] i'm a little boy
[1:09:10] trapped on the inside of a
[1:09:12] man's body
[1:09:14] there's a whole lot of boys still left
[1:09:16] in me
[1:09:19] and you know
[1:09:20] i like
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:25] hallelujah we're not having confessional
[1:09:27] tonight
[1:09:32] but you know there's something on the
[1:09:33] inside
[1:09:39] inside of humanity
[1:09:41] that likes pushing down on a pedal just
[1:09:43] a little bit to get a thrill you know
[1:09:50] you put them you can put them angel
[1:09:52] wings back there baby
[1:09:56] that's something
[1:09:58] don't tell the police officer up here or
[1:10:00] anything like that but there's every
[1:10:01] once in a while that you got to get the
[1:10:02] you got to get the dust out of the
[1:10:03] carburetor
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:09] i'm afraid too many times people got
[1:10:11] dusted or carbureted or worshiped
[1:10:18] and it's been so long since you put your
[1:10:20] foot on the pedal
[1:10:22] and you lifted your hands
[1:10:24] and you lifted your voice
[1:10:27] and things started restraining you so
[1:10:29] that you weren't at a full liberty to be
[1:10:31] able to move at a capacity that you were
[1:10:34] destined to move at
[1:10:35] but oh if you can just get into his
[1:10:37] atmosphere one time
[1:10:39] and blow the dust out of the carburetor
[1:10:41] of your soul and say god i'm here to
[1:10:44] worship you god i'm destined and built
[1:10:47] so that i could run after you father
[1:10:49] i've come to lift up the name of the
[1:10:52] most high god
[1:10:54] start blowing that dust out of the
[1:10:55] carburetor you'll see what you can run
[1:10:58] at
[1:11:01] now they tell me they tell me that
[1:11:04] in certain classes of cars like mercedes
[1:11:07] that they have the ability to run at so
[1:11:09] many so many horses per hour and they
[1:11:13] they they can run a standard a standard
[1:11:16] a standard 550 can run at 362 horses per
[1:11:21] hour i'm gonna tell you what that's more
[1:11:22] horses than brother williams got in his
[1:11:24] barn out there that thing can flat out
[1:11:26] move but you see you see if you can you
[1:11:29] see on that certain amg package you see
[1:11:31] there's something that is there that
[1:11:33] after the warranty goes out after the
[1:11:35] warranty goes out you can go in there
[1:11:38] and you can remove you can remove remove
[1:11:40] certain settings and they can go in
[1:11:42] there and take a chip and that thing is
[1:11:44] being able to move at from 362 horses
[1:11:48] per hour then to
[1:11:50] 720 horses per hour now you think about
[1:11:53] so much power that's contained in an
[1:11:55] automobile and you think if you can just
[1:11:57] remove the restraint off of it if you
[1:12:00] can remove that restraint off of it
[1:12:01] it'll move at a terrific speed and i'll
[1:12:04] say this if you get your cold ideas of
[1:12:07] what you think it is or what you think
[1:12:09] jesus is capable of doing why don't you
[1:12:11] let god out of a box just for a moment
[1:12:13] and why don't you remove the restraints
[1:12:15] that you put on the message and why
[1:12:17] don't you run it full speed ahead you'll
[1:12:19] move at a speed that you never imagined
[1:12:22] i got bad news for you that are wanting
[1:12:24] to get horses and ride in the buggy
[1:12:26] again so that you can save yourself some
[1:12:28] gas let me tell you those days are going
[1:12:30] by
[1:12:31] you might ride in one here or there up
[1:12:33] in amish country but it'll never get you
[1:12:35] to your destination
[1:12:36] and we're not living down here in
[1:12:38] martin's day we're not living down here
[1:12:39] in luther's day we're not living here in
[1:12:41] wesley's day we've been called up to
[1:12:43] come a little bit higher this is an
[1:12:45] astronaut age and only those that are
[1:12:48] destined to get in there that are
[1:12:50] elected and go through a certain course
[1:12:52] are able to move
[1:12:55] let me tell you your jet fuel's already
[1:12:57] been paid for you ain't got to worry
[1:12:59] about the price of it you ain't got to
[1:13:01] worry about how you're going to get it
[1:13:02] in there it's already in there the
[1:13:04] message has already got the dynamics
[1:13:08] just get in it
[1:13:11] just get in it
[1:13:12] [Applause]
[1:13:17] now some of y'all need to let that
[1:13:19] little boy out in you
[1:13:24] i ain't talking about here on this
[1:13:25] natural ground
[1:13:27] i'm talking about right here
[1:13:29] when you lay everything down when you
[1:13:32] decide that enough is enough of layout
[1:13:34] to see you and you decide that i'm going
[1:13:36] to finally serve god the way that he
[1:13:38] wanted me to be
[1:13:40] you know he so designed you that you are
[1:13:43] fearfully and wonderfully made that
[1:13:46] everything is in his order and
[1:13:48] everything is set up and he's designed
[1:13:51] your vessel to be a spot of worship
[1:13:54] he's designed you in such a way that you
[1:13:56] echo out hallelujahs and you went
[1:13:58] throughout amen and you worry you'll
[1:14:01] start worshiping
[1:14:03] he's the one that designed you
[1:14:06] you remember when brother branham is
[1:14:08] standing there and he's preaching on
[1:14:09] there is a man that turned on the light
[1:14:11] you remember there was a there was a
[1:14:13] mechanic that was down there working and
[1:14:15] he was working with everything within
[1:14:16] him to get this chevrolet part try to
[1:14:18] get it back together he was trying to
[1:14:20] put it back together the way that he
[1:14:22] thought it would go and he'd try this
[1:14:24] and he tried that and it just seemed
[1:14:25] like it wasn't working the way the way
[1:14:27] that he that he thought it would be
[1:14:29] but brother madam said that there was a
[1:14:30] man that was standing there and he said
[1:14:32] he was a dry a nice dressed man he was
[1:14:34] sitting there and he said son he said i
[1:14:37] believe that if you'll take this part
[1:14:39] and put this with it that everything
[1:14:41] will work according the way that it was
[1:14:43] designed to go
[1:14:45] and that brother branham said that man
[1:14:46] had enough sense to turn around and said
[1:14:49] now who are you he listened to him and
[1:14:52] he did come out exactly the way he come
[1:14:55] out exactly the way that it was designed
[1:14:56] to work at
[1:14:58] is that right and he said no who are you
[1:15:01] he said i'm the chief designer
[1:15:04] i'm the chief designer i'm the one that
[1:15:06] built this product i'm the one that
[1:15:08] built this and he knew this was the man
[1:15:10] the chief designer was there and he knew
[1:15:12] exactly the speed or he knew exactly how
[1:15:15] it was built and how it was going to
[1:15:16] manifest he was the one that designed it
[1:15:19] now brother branham said now who's got
[1:15:21] more who's got more knowledge the
[1:15:23] methodist or the baptist how to get this
[1:15:25] church in rapturing order it's the one
[1:15:28] that has designed it and he said he's a
[1:15:30] nice dressed man robed in the power of
[1:15:32] his resurrection and he's here to
[1:15:34] manifest
[1:15:37] i say god has designed you hell ain't
[1:15:39] gonna win hell ain't gonna destroy you
[1:15:42] he won't make you go down in defeat he
[1:15:44] designed you to have full victory
[1:15:47] [Applause]
[1:15:55] brother marilyn would tell us
[1:15:57] hey tell us
[1:15:58] in the feasts of trumpets he said the
[1:16:00] bride
[1:16:01] is with the words
[1:16:02] he said they're one he said how can they
[1:16:04] be one he said when the word that's
[1:16:06] wrote in there becomes you in you and
[1:16:08] makes you what makes you and the word
[1:16:10] become one
[1:16:12] he said he would go on to say and who do
[1:16:14] you say this is when the ex when the
[1:16:17] ecclesiastical powers and the economical
[1:16:20] churches or the ecumenical councils were
[1:16:22] were asking for you to come and join
[1:16:24] your hand with them so that you might be
[1:16:26] one the catholics joining together the
[1:16:28] presbyterians joining together this one
[1:16:30] joining together and they're saying that
[1:16:32] we'll be one but jesus said he said
[1:16:35] jesus prayed that we might be one he
[1:16:37] said that's true he said but not that
[1:16:39] kind of one he said be one as i and the
[1:16:42] father are one he said be that kind of
[1:16:44] one he said then how will that be he
[1:16:46] said the word in us will be the anointed
[1:16:48] word that is the oneness of god he said
[1:16:52] you see the oneness of god is the word
[1:16:54] anointed in you and then you become a
[1:16:57] son or a messiah of the age
[1:17:00] and i think
[1:17:02] that's why we can stand here and see
[1:17:03] what william branham was standing there
[1:17:05] and said it was the anointed man but now
[1:17:08] it's anointed people anointed by what by
[1:17:10] accepting what eve turned down and when
[1:17:13] eve turned down the headship of the word
[1:17:16] back there in the garden of eden she was
[1:17:18] turning down the oneness of god but
[1:17:20] there is another body on earth today
[1:17:23] that is anointed to be the messiah of
[1:17:25] this age
[1:17:26] that's had every restraint moved off of
[1:17:28] her that can do the same works that he
[1:17:31] did
[1:17:34] hallelujah
[1:17:37] now you go studying out in the old
[1:17:38] testament
[1:17:40] and you find that the bible records
[1:17:42] how that god how the gods people had
[1:17:45] lost their physical liberties
[1:17:47] at time and time again
[1:17:49] as various empires would overtake them
[1:17:52] you see the the loss of physical freedom
[1:17:55] was often tied to spiritual disobedience
[1:17:58] like worship and false gods
[1:18:00] i was reading this morning over in
[1:18:01] second chronicles 13 when jeroboam when
[1:18:04] jeroboam and abaja of abijah they come
[1:18:07] out to go to battle together and
[1:18:09] jeroboam was the king of israel
[1:18:12] and abigail they come they come to fight
[1:18:14] they come up to battle together and here
[1:18:16] jeroboam jeroboam was over there and he
[1:18:19] was supposed to be serving the true and
[1:18:21] living god
[1:18:22] as the king of israel and they voted
[1:18:25] they voted jeroboam in because of
[1:18:26] solomon's son because of his son's
[1:18:29] mistakes and because of his failures
[1:18:31] they voted jeremiah jeroboam in to be
[1:18:34] the king of them and jeroboam he got to
[1:18:37] looking out on the congregation of
[1:18:38] israel and he'd seen them going up there
[1:18:40] to feast and he seen him going up there
[1:18:43] up there to worship on the mountain
[1:18:45] going up there to jerusalem and he seen
[1:18:47] that he was beginning to lose his church
[1:18:50] he was starting to lose his church so he
[1:18:52] what he did he started introducing false
[1:18:55] gods into the message and he started
[1:18:57] introducing ideas and he started
[1:18:59] introducing and he started introducing
[1:19:02] the same thing that they wanted to do
[1:19:04] back there when moses brought them out
[1:19:06] and they built a golden calf and said
[1:19:08] this is the god that brought us out i
[1:19:10] think it's amazing when that devil
[1:19:12] raises his head again it comes back
[1:19:14] again in jeroboam and they built a
[1:19:16] golden calf and said this is the god
[1:19:19] that brought us out there ain't nothing
[1:19:20] new underneath the sun and you watch
[1:19:23] when people try to start moving in and
[1:19:25] shutting down the move of god
[1:19:28] but abajal was a real brother
[1:19:31] he was a real he was a real christian
[1:19:33] right here in this moment
[1:19:35] here eight hundred thousand men come out
[1:19:37] with jeroboam and only four hundred
[1:19:40] thousand men come out of judah they were
[1:19:42] outnumbered two to one
[1:19:44] and abijah begins to talk to him
[1:19:47] like a real brother
[1:19:50] he begins to talk to him like a real
[1:19:51] brother and sitting there you know
[1:19:53] remember he's starting to he's trying to
[1:19:54] persuade him said look
[1:19:56] look don't you remember
[1:19:58] don't you remember of the covenant that
[1:20:01] god had made between us
[1:20:03] and and david and the levites the
[1:20:05] covenant of salt the one that preserves
[1:20:08] you the one that will protect you the
[1:20:09] one that i give you that
[1:20:11] saving power don't you remember the
[1:20:14] covenant that undying covenant that he
[1:20:16] made with us
[1:20:18] notice that he's he's laying this out
[1:20:23] turn from your wicked ways he's he's
[1:20:25] he's trying to he's trying everything
[1:20:27] within him to show him the message this
[1:20:30] is the way god has said it
[1:20:32] nebuchadnezzar said look man
[1:20:35] you cast out everything that god set up
[1:20:38] you said you cast out the very design of
[1:20:40] worship
[1:20:43] you cast this out you cast out the
[1:20:45] levites
[1:20:46] you cast out the real anointed preachers
[1:20:51] and you tried to make priests
[1:20:53] instead of making them worship like god
[1:20:56] designed us to worship you made them run
[1:20:59] after false gods
[1:21:01] gods that ain't got no power god said
[1:21:03] ain't got no saving power godzilla can't
[1:21:05] heal you
[1:21:07] average i was trying to
[1:21:10] promote the message get it into his
[1:21:12] heart showing look man turn from your
[1:21:14] evil ways
[1:21:18] look man a king
[1:21:20] uses war as his last result
[1:21:25] you watch a real leader a leader will
[1:21:28] use war as his last result and abigail's
[1:21:31] taking the message and he's preaching a
[1:21:33] message and he's trying it but friend
[1:21:35] bring it before him said look you're up
[1:21:38] there in israel israel now i'm over here
[1:21:40] in judah and god set up our worship that
[1:21:42] we would bring it in before him that
[1:21:44] we'd have the sacrifice and we'd worship
[1:21:47] under the true and living god i'm
[1:21:48] telling you jeroboam don't go your way
[1:21:53] don't go after your way if you do you're
[1:21:55] going to lose
[1:21:58] look
[1:21:59] look jeroboam god himself is with us
[1:22:02] you've got gods that have no power but
[1:22:05] we have the true and living god the
[1:22:07] omnipotent jehovah that is on our side
[1:22:10] you have forsaken him but we've not
[1:22:13] forsaken him god has remembered us
[1:22:17] we kept the sabbath we worshiped we we
[1:22:20] we brought everything in before the
[1:22:21] priest we let the priest do do exactly
[1:22:24] as he as he's set up over there
[1:22:27] there's a sacrifice there's incense
[1:22:29] that's burning morning and evening
[1:22:31] that's burning there that sweet incense
[1:22:33] before the lord
[1:22:34] you walked away from it
[1:22:38] but we kept the charge
[1:22:40] of the lord our god
[1:22:42] but you forsook him
[1:22:46] and behold god himself
[1:22:49] is with us
[1:22:53] now look
[1:22:54] this is where true worship gets you
[1:22:57] you have god
[1:22:58] in your midst
[1:23:00] god himself is with us for our captain
[1:23:03] and his priests sounding trumpets to cry
[1:23:05] alarm against you o children of israel
[1:23:09] fight ye not against the lord of god the
[1:23:13] lord god of your fathers for you shall
[1:23:15] not prosper
[1:23:16] abigail knew the scripture and he was
[1:23:19] laying out before him and he recognized
[1:23:22] what moses had said over there in
[1:23:24] numbers 10 and 9 that if you go out to
[1:23:27] war in your land against the enemy that
[1:23:29] oppresses you then you shall blow an
[1:23:31] alarm with the trumpets and you shall be
[1:23:33] remembered before the lord your god and
[1:23:35] you would be saved from your enemies
[1:23:39] ebijah knew the scripture he done set up
[1:23:42] his worshipers he's then set up as
[1:23:44] levite christ his priest he set
[1:23:46] everything up and he said it's time to
[1:23:49] blow the trumpet and you're going to
[1:23:51] lose if we blow this gospel trumpet
[1:23:54] satan you are going to lose
[1:23:56] if we preach the message in its entirety
[1:23:59] you're not going to prosper
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:03] brother marlon would say that satan had
[1:24:05] a marvelous success
[1:24:07] but it failed
[1:24:08] when he met this body in this day
[1:24:11] when he met that same jesus that
[1:24:13] defeated him two thousand years ago in
[1:24:15] body form again
[1:24:17] he lost his success
[1:24:23] look verse 13 he said but jeroboam
[1:24:26] caused an ambush to come out behind him
[1:24:28] so that they were before judah and the
[1:24:31] ambushment was behind them
[1:24:33] was before judah and the ambushment was
[1:24:35] behind them and when judah looked back
[1:24:37] behold the battle was before and behind
[1:24:40] and they cried unto the lord and the
[1:24:42] priest sounded with the trumpets
[1:24:47] what were they doing
[1:24:49] they were following the instruction of
[1:24:51] the message
[1:24:54] now if god
[1:24:56] if god is as good as his word and his
[1:24:58] word is preached god will back up his
[1:25:00] word
[1:25:03] that's why i'm not afraid to lay hands
[1:25:05] on a sick
[1:25:06] and they shall recover because god is
[1:25:08] obligated to keep his word
[1:25:11] god is obligated to prove his word and
[1:25:13] if there his believing children will
[1:25:15] take him at his word you watch it
[1:25:18] doesn't matter what enemy comes up
[1:25:19] against you if you sound the trumpet
[1:25:22] that the lord your god will remember you
[1:25:25] and your enemies would be scattered i'll
[1:25:27] say this it's time to sound the gospel
[1:25:29] trumpet again it's time right now to
[1:25:32] sound off this gospel message that
[1:25:35] you're free and when the sun is set free
[1:25:38] it's free indeed
[1:25:40] and the bible said then the men of judah
[1:25:43] gave out a shout as the men of judah
[1:25:45] shouted and it came to pass that god
[1:25:47] smote jeroboam and all israel before
[1:25:51] abijah and judah
[1:25:54] completely surrounded
[1:25:57] surrounded on the front
[1:25:59] and surrounded on the back
[1:26:02] everywhere you look ain't nothing but
[1:26:03] devil
[1:26:04] devils that are trying to destroy
[1:26:06] you devils rather trying to destroy your
[1:26:09] health devils that are trying to destroy
[1:26:11] your worship devils that are trying to
[1:26:13] destroy your family you're completely
[1:26:15] surrounded but do what judah did judah
[1:26:18] still shouted and judas still worship
[1:26:21] this is how we fight our battles we
[1:26:23] might look like we're surrounded but
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:28] it might look like we're we're in defeat
[1:26:30] it might look like cancer is winning
[1:26:33] cancer can't win
[1:26:35] we've sounded the gospel trumpet
[1:26:40] we're still worshiping god the same way
[1:26:43] william branham said worship god
[1:26:45] some people don't understand your
[1:26:47] worship but it is designed to bring
[1:26:50] glory and honor unto him
[1:26:53] we've tried our best we've preached our
[1:26:55] hardest but now it's time to worship
[1:26:58] refute the devil refuse what they say
[1:27:01] about you stop
[1:27:03] listening to the lies of the devil
[1:27:08] i'm like paul i'm going to confess in
[1:27:11] the way that's called worship in the way
[1:27:13] that's called heresy is how i worship my
[1:27:16] god
[1:27:18] they say it's true pentecostal well i
[1:27:20] just worship god this way they say we're
[1:27:22] too excited well i just worshiped god
[1:27:24] this way
[1:27:30] brother ram says we believe in them old
[1:27:32] time heartfelt salvation
[1:27:35] he said we believe in the people's
[1:27:36] liberty to be able to say amen and
[1:27:38] praise the lord he said whatever the
[1:27:40] spirit of god leads you to do do it and
[1:27:42] he won't lead you to do anything but
[1:27:43] what's right
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:51] and he
[1:27:52] is the spirit and god is a spirit and
[1:27:55] they that worship him must worship him
[1:27:57] in spirit and in truth and god the very
[1:28:00] word god means an object to worship
[1:28:04] so god likes to be worshiped by his
[1:28:07] children that we can be free and not
[1:28:09] bound down in the yolks but we can
[1:28:11] exercise our faith in him and believe it
[1:28:14] and not be ashamed to tell the world
[1:28:16] about it
[1:28:25] let me tell you
[1:28:29] there's been a lot of things taken from
[1:28:31] me

[1:28:58] that ever come into my life don't you
[1:29:00] take this message away from me

[1:29:04] pit

[1:29:07] life it was this message that gave me a
[1:29:09] wife it was this message that gave me a
[1:29:11] real family it was this message that
[1:29:13] gave me the greatest friends in life it
[1:29:15] was this message that put me on a stage
[1:29:17] to stomp out every devil that's raising
[1:29:20] its head it's this message and now i'm
[1:29:24] i'm obligated to preach this message i'm
[1:29:26] obligated to stand here why would i turn

[1:30:20] stood right across this mess it's right
[1:30:22] across this mountain right here
[1:30:26] and riding on horseback
[1:30:30] and there was a man that was given his
[1:30:31] life
[1:30:32] because of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:30:35] and he was standing there
[1:30:37] and this preacher was saying some of his
[1:30:39] last words
[1:30:41] and he heard this preacher patrick henry
[1:30:43] riding on his horse and he stopped by
[1:30:45] and he heard this preacher standing
[1:30:46] there saying give me liberty
[1:30:49] or give me death
[1:30:52] patrick henry had been in the house of
[1:30:54] birds has been out of it back and forth
[1:30:56] and all those things
[1:30:58] but when it come time when britain was
[1:31:00] pressing down upon upon the americans
[1:31:02] and trying to rule them trying to rule
[1:31:04] the nation and trying to make
[1:31:06] intolerable acts come to pass

[1:31:18] what they're saying
[1:31:20] he stood there in the church in
[1:31:22] williamsburg which many of you stood
[1:31:23] there and many of you felt you felt the
[1:31:26] impact of that building you could you

[1:31:47] to cope with such a formidable adversary
[1:31:50] but when shall we be stronger

[1:31:55] the holy cause of liberty and in such a
[1:31:57] country as that which we possess aren't
[1:32:00] invincible by any force which our enemy
[1:32:03] can send against us
[1:32:04] here's patrick henry saying these things
[1:32:06] in the natural
[1:32:09] he said we are invincible by any force
[1:32:11] which our enemy can send against us
[1:32:13] besides sir we shall not fight our
[1:32:15] battles alone there is a just god who
[1:32:18] presides over the destinies of the

[1:32:53] him telling us that the days of miracles
[1:32:55] have passed give me my liberty or give
[1:32:58] me death
[1:33:00] and patrick henry could stand there and
[1:33:02] say hey man we're going to have to have
[1:33:04] the posture of defense let's stand as a
[1:33:07] church of the living god and have a
[1:33:09] posture of defense there's no weapon
[1:33:18] there's no weapon that is formed against
[1:33:20] the bride of jesus christ that'll
[1:33:22] prosper if god is for this bride who can
[1:33:25] be against this bride
[1:33:27] if jesus said i can do all things
[1:33:29] through christ who strengthens me let's
[1:33:31] stand there
[1:33:34] [Applause]
[1:33:36] you're gonna have to fix it it's too
[1:33:37] terrible up here
[1:33:40] it's
[1:33:41] it's reverberating up here i'm sorry
[1:33:44] but we're gonna have to stop giving
[1:33:45] power
[1:33:46] to the voice of our adversary and stop
[1:33:49] confessing his thoughts
[1:33:53] if we're going to confess anything let's
[1:33:55] confess what jesus said about us
[1:33:57] he is the high priest of our confession
[1:34:00] he's the high priest of your confession
[1:34:02] let me quote you your prophet he said do
[1:34:04] you get what i mean what you confess you
[1:34:07] are that's what you are any man will
[1:34:09] never live any further or any higher
[1:34:11] than what he believes he's living he
[1:34:13] said you take a man that's talking about
[1:34:15] drinking all the time and he talks about
[1:34:17] drinking he thinks about drinking he
[1:34:19] drops right down into that category and
[1:34:21] becomes a drunkard he said a man that's
[1:34:23] always thinking about vulgar things
[1:34:25] that's what he'll do
[1:34:27] but i'm going to stand here and i'm
[1:34:29] going to confess what jesus said
[1:34:32] i'm going to confess isaiah 53 i am
[1:34:35] healed i am delivered i am stronger than
[1:34:38] i thought i was i am not as weak as the
[1:34:40] devil tells me hell i am i am gonna make
[1:34:43] it
[1:34:44] i have what it takes i'm a real
[1:34:47] overcomer i'm a child of god i am god's
[1:34:50] son i am robed with the holy ghost i can
[1:34:52] cast satan out before the throne of god
[1:34:55] anytime i'm equipped i'm empowered i've
[1:34:58] been given authority as adopted sons and
[1:35:00] daughters of god and i have full status
[1:35:03] as his offspring i am fully authorized
[1:35:06] to use the name of jesus christ for any
[1:35:09] need at any time i am a
[1:35:12] believer i'm not going to confess what
[1:35:15] satan said about me
[1:35:19] i'm going to confess what jesus said
[1:35:20] about me it's time that you start taking
[1:35:23] the mentality
[1:35:25] as a son and daughter of god
[1:35:30] what if you take the mentality
[1:35:33] and you listen to what the enemy has
[1:35:35] whispered about you
[1:35:40] let's go down to his camp real quick and
[1:35:42] let's hear him whispering about you
[1:35:46] you're not good enough
[1:35:47] you'll never live this you'll never be
[1:35:49] this
[1:35:50] let's go down to his camp and let's call
[1:35:52] him out just for a minute let's let's
[1:35:54] listen to what he's got to say
[1:35:56] that's what he's whispering in your ears
[1:35:58] but down in hell he's whispering some
[1:36:00] other things
[1:36:01] if they ever catch
[1:36:03] who they really are
[1:36:04] i am defeated
[1:36:07] i see too much quickening power on them
[1:36:10] and if they really grab a hold of it
[1:36:12] they're right there in the atmosphere
[1:36:14] and if they ever really grab a hold of
[1:36:16] it
[1:36:18] i'm gonna get my props knocked out from
[1:36:19] underneath of me
[1:36:22] [Music]
[1:36:28] why don't you start thinking
[1:36:30] what the devil really thinks about you
[1:36:33] not what he whispers in your
[1:36:36] ear he knows he can't handle you
[1:36:41] you remember in ezekiel 37 when ezekiel
[1:36:44] went over there and he was shown a
[1:36:45] valley full of dry bones
[1:36:47] you remember he said he said you come
[1:36:49] over here and look on this valley full
[1:36:50] of dry bones and you watch he said can
[1:36:53] these bones live again he said thou
[1:36:55] knowest lord thou know us if these
[1:36:57] people can really live out this message
[1:36:59] you really you know if they can really
[1:37:00] experience the liberty of this message
[1:37:02] you only know that he said
[1:37:04] prophesy speak to the bones
[1:37:07] speak to them prophesy upon them son of
[1:37:09] man and you watch you watch as that's
[1:37:12] four stages of it it was bones in you
[1:37:14] skin and and the wind that came upon
[1:37:17] them
[1:37:18] he said prophesy upon him
[1:37:20] prophesy and he said i heard a rattling
[1:37:22] and i heard a noise and he said it was
[1:37:24] bone coming to bone
[1:37:27] he said and there he said then
[1:37:29] prophesied and then he watched the sin
[1:37:30] you come upon him he watched the muscle
[1:37:32] come upon him he watched the skin come
[1:37:34] upon him but he said there was no wind
[1:37:36] there
[1:37:37] there was no wind there he said son of
[1:37:40] man prophesy to the wind
[1:37:43] and breathe on them
[1:37:48] now a while back i was studying on this
[1:37:49] salt
[1:37:51] i studied on this salt right here just
[1:37:53] going over ezekiel 37.
[1:37:56] man i was heaven i was having a hard
[1:37:58] time putting it together
[1:37:59] exactly the way the lord wanted me to
[1:38:01] put it together
[1:38:03] my papa charlie met me in a dream
[1:38:06] he said andrew
[1:38:07] he said if you'll focus on that fourth
[1:38:09] spot
[1:38:10] if you'll focus on the fourth stage he
[1:38:12] said everything will be all right
[1:38:16] now let me give you some words from the
[1:38:17] other side
[1:38:20] from a man of faith if you can focus on
[1:38:22] the wind
[1:38:24] if you can focus on the wind god's got a
[1:38:26] body god's got muscles here and god's
[1:38:28] got skin on earth right now but if he
[1:38:30] can breathe upon you the breath of life
[1:38:33] that which he was standing there in john
[1:38:35] and he said breathe and he breathed on
[1:38:36] them and said receive you the holy ghost
[1:38:38] and they went up there on the day of
[1:38:40] pentecost if my papa charlie could come
[1:38:42] from that side of the grave and said
[1:38:44] focus on this part let me tell you full
[1:38:47] gospel lighthouse it's time that you
[1:38:48] focus your life into the power of the
[1:38:51] holy ghost and then
[1:38:54] and i breathed upon them i spoke the
[1:38:56] word and breath entered into them
[1:39:00] what happened they stood upon their feet
[1:39:03] what was it it was the word that brought
[1:39:06] them to their position
[1:39:09] what's brought you here it was the word
[1:39:12] it's not man's doing it's the word that
[1:39:14] brought you here this is him this is a
[1:39:17] lord steward
[1:39:18] [Applause]
[1:39:20] each time that you start taking words
[1:39:23] from the other side
[1:39:26] don't take what satan said take what god
[1:39:29] said you're gonna make it
[1:39:42] and there stood up an exceeding great
[1:39:44] army
[1:39:47] breathe on him
[1:39:52] don't you see why satan's afraid of you
[1:39:55] it's because the breath of god is
[1:39:56] breathing on his children today and he's
[1:39:58] doing everything within his power to
[1:40:01] stop you
[1:40:03] to stop you from getting to this
[1:40:04] position but he showed up too late the
[1:40:08] word is here the word's called to your
[1:40:10] feet the word has done this
[1:40:18] [Applause]
[1:40:25] back in the late 80s
[1:40:27] early 90s
[1:40:34] there was a bad there's a bad dude that
[1:40:37] was in a ring
[1:40:39] named mike tyson
[1:40:41] man he showed up on the scene
[1:40:44] everybody's saying this is the next
[1:40:45] muhammad ali
[1:40:48] nobody could stop and
[1:40:51] he'd won fight after fight after fight
[1:40:54] and there'd never been anybody
[1:40:56] after mike tyson and knocked them up
[1:40:59] knocked them out
[1:41:00] had they ever got back up
[1:41:05] knocked them completely out and they
[1:41:07] never got back in the ring
[1:41:14] but buster douglas
[1:41:16] come for his time to fight him
[1:41:21] and his mama told him
[1:41:23] buster
[1:41:25] you're gonna whip mike tyson
[1:41:27] you're gonna whip mike tyson
[1:41:31] he trained with everything within him
[1:41:32] because ain't never been anybody that
[1:41:34] got knocked out by mike tyson that got
[1:41:37] back up
[1:41:38] he trained like never before his mama
[1:41:40] kept telling him so you're going to beat
[1:41:41] mike tyson you're going to beat him
[1:41:43] you're going to beat him
[1:41:45] and two days before the fight buster
[1:41:47] douglas's mama died
[1:41:51] it come to the fight
[1:41:53] mike tyson is warned with buster douglas
[1:41:56] he's beating him everywhere around that
[1:41:57] ring and knocks him out
[1:42:01] buster douglas lays there
[1:42:03] and he gets back up
[1:42:05] and he goes over in his corner
[1:42:07] and he starts remembering what his mama
[1:42:09] told him
[1:42:10] you're gonna whip mike tyson
[1:42:12] you're gonna whip mike tyson
[1:42:15] and buster douglas come out there and he
[1:42:17] beat mike tyson mike tyson's own words
[1:42:20] everybody's got a plan until they get
[1:42:22] punched in the mouth
[1:42:23] mike tyson lost a plan
[1:42:26] and buster douglas remembered what his
[1:42:28] mama had said and he remembered those
[1:42:31] words beyond that veil of death
[1:42:34] and here's my thought to you
[1:42:36] if a man can take those words from that
[1:42:38] side of a veil how much more as the
[1:42:41] elect of god should we take the words of
[1:42:43] a prophet that's went beyond the veil
[1:42:46] and said there's been a vision seen over
[1:42:48] you
[1:42:48] you can do it you're going to win you
[1:42:51] are bone of his bone life of his life
[1:42:53] power of his power
[1:42:57] i'm gonna take what a prophet has said
[1:42:59] about me not what satan has said about
[1:43:02] me
[1:43:13] we're fighting this enemy right now like
[1:43:15] never before
[1:43:17] right here
[1:43:19] in the middle
[1:43:20] of satan's eaton
[1:43:23] and you ordained
[1:43:25] to be an overcomer
[1:43:28] you ordained to win this battle
[1:43:31] there's a power on the inside of you
[1:43:34] that's got to come out
[1:43:37] there's healing on this in this body
[1:43:39] there's deliverance in this body
[1:43:42] there's power in this body there's peace
[1:43:44] in this body
[1:43:46] there's glory in this body
[1:43:51] but the enemy's trying to creep its way
[1:43:53] into this body and tell you you can't
[1:43:55] have full liberty it's time as sons and
[1:43:57] daughters of god you start manifesting
[1:43:59] what god has destined you to be
[1:44:03] this is the manifestation of the
[1:44:06] resurrection
[1:44:07] for the people in this day
[1:44:20] i'm struggling brother andrew
[1:44:23] i'm struggling
[1:44:25] i got good days and i got bad days
[1:44:30] i've got days when i feel like a
[1:44:31] christian in days when i don't feel like
[1:44:32] a christian there's a lot of emotions
[1:44:36] that i go through brother andrew
[1:44:40] satan wars with my mind
[1:44:42] over and over and over again
[1:44:46] it's time you focus on the fourth stage
[1:44:52] and when you get there
[1:44:54] and he breathes the breath of life in
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:58] get ready
[1:45:00] you're gonna have more troubles than you
[1:45:01] ever had before
[1:45:03] you're gonna have more mind battles than
[1:45:04] you ever have before
[1:45:06] you're gonna have more struggles
[1:45:09] there's days when you don't really feel
[1:45:11] like a
[1:45:14] on top of the mountain
[1:45:17] there's days when kids are screaming and
[1:45:20] man
[1:45:22] it's just fun to be a teacher in it
[1:45:29] it's days when brother stephen he just
[1:45:31] gets a little out of hand
[1:45:33] you need a little bit more jesus in the
[1:45:34] house right
[1:45:41] but does it mean
[1:45:43] that you don't have the holy ghost just
[1:45:45] because you go through troubles and just
[1:45:47] because you go through trials
[1:45:50] this body is the most powerful body that
[1:45:52] there is
[1:45:54] but brother branham said it's one of the
[1:45:55] most sickest bodies that i know is the
[1:45:57] body of the lord jesus christ you're
[1:45:59] going to go through trials you're going
[1:46:00] to go through tribulations you're going
[1:46:02] to go through struggles but all of that
[1:46:04] is coming to an end when satan is
[1:46:07] finished you'll never be finished when
[1:46:09] satan is over you're just beginning
[1:46:14] because you focus
[1:46:16] on the fourth stage when the wind come
[1:46:18] into a body and a resurrected body to be
[1:46:22] exactly like the son of man walking in
[1:46:25] flesh again
[1:46:29] a body
[1:46:31] thou has
[1:46:32] prepared for me
[1:46:38] a body i can work
[1:46:41] a body i could work through a body i
[1:46:44] could lay my hands on a body i can do
[1:46:47] that as a really believer a body
[1:46:51] it looked close in luther it looked
[1:46:53] close in wesley but a body
[1:46:58] it was so close the pentecostals really
[1:47:01] thought they were there
[1:47:03] but i finally got a body
[1:47:06] i got a body that's john 14 12. i got a
[1:47:09] body that's john 15 7. i got a body
[1:47:12] that's mark 16 an action i've got a body
[1:47:15] that's got full liberty that's got the
[1:47:18] same power that i've got that's got
[1:47:20] power to cast satan out that's got power
[1:47:22] to condemn sin it's got power
[1:47:31] destroy this temple
[1:47:33] and i'll raise it up again
[1:47:41] it's going to be my greatest honor
[1:47:44] to stand there on that day
[1:47:48] to stand shoulder to shoulder with
[1:47:50] brother homer
[1:47:51] and brother ron
[1:47:55] say lord jesus
[1:47:58] men said i didn't have much and they
[1:48:00] despised a day of small things
[1:48:05] but i took this message
[1:48:07] and i preached it with everything within
[1:48:08] me
[1:48:11] it was just a small group over there in
[1:48:13] elkton
[1:48:16] but this is the body
[1:48:24] if i could hear
[1:48:25] coming through the veil just for a
[1:48:27] moment
[1:48:28] give me a little bit of liberty right
[1:48:30] here
[1:48:31] if i could hear coming through the veil
[1:48:35] brother homer
[1:48:41] you're exactly
[1:48:43] what i built this church for
[1:48:48] i didn't build it for my own emotion and
[1:48:51] i didn't build it for my own eagle
[1:48:53] but i built it that it would be a place
[1:48:55] where god would come and feel welcome
[1:49:01] men scrutinize me and men criticize me
[1:49:05] but i preach the message
[1:49:10] keep fighting
[1:49:12] keep fighting
[1:49:14] don't give up
[1:49:15] keep fighting
[1:49:17] you're almost there
[1:49:20] you're almost there and when you get to
[1:49:22] the finish line i'll be right there
[1:49:24] and when we're going to present you
[1:49:26] before the lord jesus christ
[1:49:28] i'll be right there with brother on i'll
[1:49:30] be right there with brother angel i'll
[1:49:32] be right there with those men of god
[1:49:33] [Applause]
[1:49:37] but if we could echo out through that
[1:49:39] veil on the other side brother homer we
[1:49:41] appreciate you
[1:49:43] standing for this message thank you for
[1:49:45] setting a
[1:49:55] a standard
[1:49:57] a body thou has to prepare for me
[1:50:00] a body that's not afraid to use the
[1:50:02] gifts of god a body is that it's not
[1:50:04] ashamed to speak in tongues a body
[1:50:06] that's not ashamed to interpret a body
[1:50:08] that's not ashamed to prophesy a body
[1:50:11] that's not ashamed of love a body that's
[1:50:13] not ashamed to work a body that's not
[1:50:15] ashamed to move
[1:50:17] a body
[1:50:20] a body thou has prepared for me
[1:50:26] i echoed out my heart to you a few weeks
[1:50:28] ago
[1:50:31] on god's anticipation
[1:50:36] i can't get away from it
[1:50:39] i cannot get away
[1:50:41] from the facts
[1:50:43] or the thoughts
[1:50:45] of god's anticipation
[1:50:49] you know as a little child mama says
[1:50:52] you're going
[1:50:54] you're going on this trip or you're
[1:50:55] going to disney world
[1:50:57] man you you're anticipating it
[1:51:01] you've made out plans
[1:51:02] you've already picked out what you're
[1:51:04] going to eat
[1:51:08] i know what i'm talking about
[1:51:10] those those are the dreams that are real
[1:51:13] nightmares to me
[1:51:20] i'm trying not to go cardinal right now
[1:51:30] you've just designed this whole trip and
[1:51:32] set it up
[1:51:36] you've already picked out your mickey
[1:51:37] waffles
[1:51:41] you've already got every idea where
[1:51:42] you're gonna get your cotton candy and
[1:51:45] the greatest ice creams and the biggest
[1:51:46] donuts ain't that right brother scotty
[1:51:50] you've got everything set up
[1:51:53] and a child as a child
[1:51:55] you're anticipating this day
[1:51:57] you can't hardly sleep at night
[1:52:02] you're dreaming about it
[1:52:04] and you get there and it's raining
[1:52:10] things did not turn out
[1:52:12] the way you thought it would
[1:52:14] your wife don't let you have that extra
[1:52:16] spicy chicken waffle
[1:52:18] and things just don't go the way that
[1:52:19] you want it to go
[1:52:27] but god has anticipated this day
[1:52:38] it won't not be out of place
[1:52:41] there won't be one person missing there
[1:52:43] won't be one plate that's missed or
[1:52:45] added to
[1:52:47] god designed you
[1:52:49] and he built himself a body and he's
[1:52:51] already got your seat and your name tags
[1:52:53] picked out
[1:52:59] everything's gonna be just right
[1:53:03] you eat something that just don't
[1:53:05] satisfy and you start looking for
[1:53:06] something else down here on earth
[1:53:09] but when you start eating there the
[1:53:11] wedding supper
[1:53:15] the best the world's got to offer here
[1:53:17] is nothing that is to be compared
[1:53:26] i believe
[1:53:27] that his anticipation
[1:53:29] has been met in this body
[1:53:33] with every fiber of my being
[1:53:37] god has a body that he fully trusts
[1:53:40] god has a body that he has full
[1:53:44] confidence in
[1:53:46] she won't fail
[1:53:49] she won't fault her
[1:53:51] she won't cater to men's ideas
[1:53:54] but she's strictly
[1:53:56] led
[1:53:58] by the leadership
[1:54:01] of the lord
[1:54:03] amen
[1:54:04] why don't you stand with me
[1:54:18] um
[1:54:32] i can't see
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:47] it feels
[1:54:48] good to know that god slept
[1:54:52] slipped onto your hand
[1:54:55] the wedding band of unmerited grace
[1:55:04] it feels good to know
[1:55:06] i'm the one william branham saw
[1:55:10] it feels good to know
[1:55:15] i was seen in a vision
