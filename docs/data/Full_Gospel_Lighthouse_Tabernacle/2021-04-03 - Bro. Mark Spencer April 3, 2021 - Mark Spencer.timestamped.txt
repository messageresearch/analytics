[1:03:19] tonight
[1:03:20] we ask us for your glory in jesus
[1:03:23] christ's name we pray
[1:03:25] amen amen jonah 1
[1:03:36] now jonah the word of the lord came unto
[1:03:39] jonah the son of amethyst
[1:03:41] saying arise and go to nineveh
[1:03:44] that great city and cry against it
[1:03:48] their wickedness has come before me but
[1:03:50] jonah rose up and
[1:03:52] to flee unto tarnish
[1:03:55] from the presence of the lord and went
[1:03:58] to joppa
[1:03:59] and there he found a ship to tarnish so
[1:04:02] he paid the further of
[1:04:04] and went there and down into it to go
[1:04:07] with them
[1:04:07] unto tarnish from the presence of the
[1:04:10] lord
[1:04:11] but the lord sent out a great wind into
[1:04:13] the sea
[1:04:14] there was a mighty tempest in the sea
[1:04:17] so that the ship was like to be broken
[1:04:22] then the mariners were afraid and cried
[1:04:24] everyone
[1:04:25] every man into his god and cast forth
[1:04:27] their wares
[1:04:28] that they were in the ship of the sea
[1:04:30] into the sea to lighten it
[1:04:32] of them but jonah was gone down inside
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:35] in the size of the ship and he lay and
[1:04:37] was fast asleep
[1:04:40] so the ship master came to him and said
[1:04:41] unto him what meanest thou will sleeper
[1:04:44] arise call upon thy god
[1:04:47] and if so be that that god will think
[1:04:50] upon us
[1:04:51] that we shall not perish we perish not
[1:04:54] and they said every one of them to his
[1:04:56] fellows come and let us cast lots
[1:04:59] that we may know who is the cause of
[1:05:01] this evil
[1:05:02] is upon us so they cast lots and the
[1:05:05] lots fell upon jonah then they said unto
[1:05:08] him tell us
[1:05:09] we pray for whose cause this evil is
[1:05:12] upon us
[1:05:14] what is thine occupation and whence
[1:05:16] cometh thou
[1:05:18] what is thy country and of what people
[1:05:20] art thou
[1:05:21] and he said unto them i am a hebrew
[1:05:24] and i fear the lord and the god of
[1:05:26] heaven which hath made the sea
[1:05:29] and the dry land then the men were
[1:05:32] exceedingly frayed
[1:05:34] and said unto him why hast thou done
[1:05:36] this for the men knew
[1:05:38] that he fled from the presence of the
[1:05:39] lord because he had told them
[1:05:42] and then they said unto him what shall
[1:05:44] we do unto thee that the sea may calm
[1:05:46] down
[1:05:47] and from this wrought and so temptress
[1:05:51] and he said unto them take me up cast me
[1:05:54] forth
[1:05:55] unto the sea so that the sea will become
[1:05:58] for you
[1:05:59] for i know that for my sake this is the
[1:06:01] great temptus
[1:06:02] is upon you may the lord add his
[1:06:05] blessings to his word deceiving amen you
[1:06:07] may be seated
[1:06:09] we look at description we've read it and
[1:06:10] we've heard it many times
[1:06:12] we look at the times that we've we've
[1:06:14] been in those have you ever been in the
[1:06:15] belly of a well
[1:06:17] when they cast him off of there there
[1:06:18] was a special fish that was made that
[1:06:20] was come up to take him under
[1:06:22] hey man i looked at this and i'm looking
[1:06:23] at this from a standpoint of jesus
[1:06:25] christ and what he had to do
[1:06:26] when he went into the belly of hell amen
[1:06:29] when he was cast down he
[1:06:31] here's jonah and jonah is sitting here
[1:06:32] and he's looking at things and he's
[1:06:34] taking it
[1:06:35] taking it he's roaming in he he knows
[1:06:37] what's going on
[1:06:38] and it says to look at it brother braham
[1:06:39] says looking at the old testament as a
[1:06:41] shadow of the new testament
[1:06:43] and i looked at it and i've seen jonah
[1:06:45] here he's sitting here he could have he
[1:06:46] could have
[1:06:47] told him anything but he told them the
[1:06:49] truth and they
[1:06:50] they knew and you'll notice in the
[1:06:52] scriptures that their god was small but
[1:06:53] his god was
[1:06:54] g big g was inside of there amen i thank
[1:06:57] god tonight
[1:06:58] the big g is in here tonight amen and i
[1:07:00] looked at this and i said you know
[1:07:02] that's just what the devil wants to do
[1:07:03] he wants to get us caught up in the
[1:07:05] tempest of life and the things that's
[1:07:07] going on and
[1:07:08] the many times we get caught in the
[1:07:09] belly of that well amen
[1:07:11] and we look at that we say there's no
[1:07:12] way out and we see the thing but he
[1:07:14] he willingly he willingly gave himself
[1:07:17] over to those mariners that was there
[1:07:19] to save their lives and they knew there
[1:07:20] was something different about him than
[1:07:22] there was about anybody else because his
[1:07:24] god
[1:07:24] was god amen he brought that temptates
[1:07:26] upon them and
[1:07:27] you look at it you see he freely gave
[1:07:29] himself over to him he didn't fight
[1:07:31] he didn't he said this is my fault this
[1:07:33] is my what i'm doing
[1:07:34] and you know you can look at the world
[1:07:35] what all's going on now right now the
[1:07:37] devil is trying to stop this bride
[1:07:39] the devil is trying to stop this bride
[1:07:41] and what are you doing you being a
[1:07:42] lighthouse to those ones that are out
[1:07:43] here
[1:07:43] beyond the walls of this amen you're
[1:07:45] being a lighthouse as you walk out there
[1:07:47] we are the reason this is coming up on
[1:07:49] this earth amen we are the reason
[1:07:50] brother brown told us what was going to
[1:07:52] happen
[1:07:53] in the latter times and how temperatures
[1:07:55] would come up on the devil is trying to
[1:07:56] stop you
[1:07:57] and he's trying to keep you at home he's
[1:07:58] trying to separate you from the love of
[1:08:00] god
[1:08:00] but there's something on the inside of
[1:08:02] you that says my god is greater than
[1:08:04] anything that they can come upon me
[1:08:05] and man you look at this you see god
[1:08:07] moving but you see him you see jonah
[1:08:09] here he is he's handing himself over to
[1:08:11] him what should we do with you he bind
[1:08:12] me up and cast me off into the sea
[1:08:14] and then they're instantly well no no no
[1:08:16] let's find something else let's find
[1:08:18] another way
[1:08:18] but no this is the only way it's going
[1:08:20] to return calm to you amen the only way
[1:08:22] and that's to find the true god amen
[1:08:24] and we look at it we see him as he's
[1:08:26] pitched over the side hey man
[1:08:28] instantly there was a special fish made
[1:08:29] up amen there's a special fish made up i
[1:08:31] think about brother brandon when he
[1:08:32] talks about that little girl walking
[1:08:34] down through there and
[1:08:34] they'll though the guy standing there
[1:08:37] he's talking he said do you really
[1:08:38] believe what they say in that bible he
[1:08:40] said
[1:08:40] she goes yes i do he said well then tell
[1:08:43] me this and i know y'all heard these
[1:08:44] stories i can't tell you nothing new
[1:08:45] because god's the same amen but we look
[1:08:47] at we see
[1:08:47] he goes do you really believe that said
[1:08:49] yeah this morning we study about jonah
[1:08:51] oh you don't really believe that story

[1:08:58] train of thought we looked at it we see
[1:09:00] god moving
[1:09:02] we see him there she goes i know it
[1:09:05] i know it was true you can't believe
[1:09:07] that a a fish a whale could
[1:09:09] swallow him up said how do you know
[1:09:10] that's true she goes when i get to
[1:09:12] heaven
[1:09:13] i'll ask you yeah well he just quickly
[1:09:16] turned that around on her that's what
[1:09:18] the devil likes to do
[1:09:19] the devil likes to turn it around on you
[1:09:22] because well
[1:09:22] what if he didn't go to heaven then you
[1:09:24] ask him
[1:09:28] hey man you need to know where you're
[1:09:29] standing at amen if somebody beside you
[1:09:31] don't go to heaven hey man that don't
[1:09:33] hold you back you can praise god
[1:09:35] and man sometimes if somebody says well
[1:09:36] i just want to i just want to put my
[1:09:38] breaks down i want to hold this service
[1:09:40] up or i want to do it no what you need
[1:09:41] to do beside them say
[1:09:42] praise you lord thank you lord brother
[1:09:44] fraser taught me how to praise god amen
[1:09:46] he taught me how to praise god even
[1:09:48] through the darkest of time he taught me
[1:09:50] how to praise god
[1:09:51] jesus taught you how to do that and i
[1:09:53] looked it up and jonah he was pitched
[1:09:54] overboard amen and i want to get right
[1:09:56] down into what's going on
[1:09:57] amen i see i see jonas he's resting
[1:10:00] there amen he's down in the belly of
[1:10:02] this well it's a special made well
[1:10:04] i know you've heard this story many
[1:10:05] times but i looked at it there was air
[1:10:07] down inside of there
[1:10:10] there was there down inside there enough
[1:10:11] to sustain him for quite a while
[1:10:13] for quite a while it sustained him what
[1:10:16] he got him to doing
[1:10:17] many times god will leave you in the
[1:10:19] valley of destruction in the belly of
[1:10:21] the well
[1:10:22] and so long until the only thing you
[1:10:23] could do is start finding your way
[1:10:25] around
[1:10:26] which way is the lord my god amen which
[1:10:29] way should i face to praise him
[1:10:31] which way should i pray to him i mean
[1:10:33] many times we find ourselves our
[1:10:34] allotment in life we're saying god
[1:10:36] the devil has us so wrapped up in
[1:10:38] bondage that we can look around we can
[1:10:40] see the seaweeds of life
[1:10:41] amen with drinking and smoking and you
[1:10:43] know we've all been a fear to something
[1:10:45] amen
[1:10:45] but you look at them but a trick of an
[1:10:47] enemy that tells you you've got to fear
[1:10:49] this so you got there's no fear in them

[1:12:44] you've got a bird's eye view that every
[1:12:45] week you're getting to look at the acts
[1:12:47] of the process of god amen that god's
[1:12:50] come down he's touching and healing and
[1:12:52] moving by his spirit upon him about to
[1:12:53] give him the strength amen
[1:12:55] and not just to come up here and i mean
[1:12:56] just to hold up something

[1:13:00] he's sitting there and he's a he's
[1:13:02] he's going hey man that's kind of god he
[1:13:04] gives you a little step in your foot
[1:13:06] amen i remember my mom eventually saying
[1:13:08] ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
[1:13:10] hey man she was sucker and even though
[1:13:11] she had her knees replaced she would
[1:13:13] crawl up off that piano
[1:13:14] and she would start praising god amen
[1:13:16] for something on the inside
[1:13:18] brother branham says it like this right
[1:13:19] here he said if you set a man on fire he
[1:13:21] can't set steel
[1:13:22] and if a fire the holy ghost is on the
[1:13:24] inside of you you can't set steel amen
[1:13:26] because god is moving but if you feel
[1:13:28] yourself as all darkened out about
[1:13:30] what's looking what's going on around
[1:13:32] you
[1:13:32] it's time for you to stop looking at
[1:13:33] what's going on around you and start
[1:13:34] looking up to finding jesus christ amen
[1:13:37] brother branham says it like this right
[1:13:38] here right now what we need
[1:13:41] and in this day and hour it's no better
[1:13:42] time than this just to preach this right
[1:13:44] here
[1:13:44] it's no better time amen stop coming to
[1:13:47] church because you say well i go to full
[1:13:49] gospel lighthouse
[1:13:50] many people have sat here in these
[1:13:52] services around the world and they have
[1:13:54] just gotten used to going to church
[1:13:56] it's just another passion of time that
[1:13:58] they have well it's just better than
[1:13:59] going to walmart or this is better than
[1:14:01] just staying home i get to see my
[1:14:02] friends
[1:14:03] no you need to come in with a passion
[1:14:05] inside of your life
[1:14:06] that says i'm coming to meet jesus
[1:14:09] christ one more time
[1:14:10] a new and a rich and and fill in the
[1:14:12] side of my life that no longer am i
[1:14:14] going to be the same when i walk through
[1:14:15] that door
[1:14:16] many times people walk through that door
[1:14:18] back there thinking i'm rapture ready
[1:14:20] hey man if you was rapture ready you
[1:14:22] would be praising god more and more
[1:14:23] every day
[1:14:24] amen get more and more in tune with
[1:14:26] what's going on so that means there's
[1:14:27] something
[1:14:28] on the inside that needs to come out
[1:14:30] brother thomas there's something there
[1:14:31] that's going i got to get closer to god
[1:14:33] he's given me another opportunity to be
[1:14:34] in service i need to be there brother
[1:14:36] branham says that what we need
[1:14:38] is a dine out a rotten and out to me
[1:14:40] amen to me mark spencer i need to get
[1:14:42] i need to get rotten down to myself so
[1:14:44] that i can rise to live with jesus
[1:14:46] christ amen
[1:14:47] i thank god for that tonight and that's
[1:14:49] what's going on with jonah
[1:14:51] jonah's sitting there in that well and
[1:14:52] he's down there and he called it the
[1:14:54] belly of hell
[1:14:55] amen right now probably brother donny
[1:14:57] thinks about sometimes he probably
[1:14:58] thinks he's in the belly of hell
[1:15:00] because he looks at everything that's
[1:15:01] going around it can drop your spirits
[1:15:04] i've been there i've walked those steps
[1:15:05] it can make you feel bad
[1:15:07] but you look at it god is right there
[1:15:10] with you
[1:15:11] right there with you all the time when
[1:15:14] you see everything's going wrong
[1:15:15] but it takes you personally
[1:15:19] to get down on your knees and start
[1:15:21] praying to god
[1:15:22] you could look at all that's going on
[1:15:24] around you you could find yourself
[1:15:26] caught up in all of that mock and that
[1:15:28] mire but then you got to look around and
[1:15:30] say
[1:15:30] look at all the aragon he gave me enough
[1:15:33] air to breathe
[1:15:34] he gave me enough to praise god back
[1:15:36] amen there should be a revival going on
[1:15:38] in your darkest of hours
[1:15:39] there should be something going on thank
[1:15:41] you god that i still got a hair
[1:15:43] that i can praise you thank you god that
[1:15:45] no matter what's going on
[1:15:46] god you're still moving my feet hey man

[1:16:11] underneath it and didn't get caught
[1:16:12] but i thank god for that god has a
[1:16:14] purpose amen but i thought

[1:21:06] jonah we known him we we know him as a
[1:21:08] prophet men
[1:21:09] referred to him as some kind of roundup
[1:21:11] run about prophet he wasn't a run about
[1:21:13] the footsteps
[1:21:14] of the righteous are foreordained by the
[1:21:15] lord amen many times we look at it we
[1:21:17] see that he got they
[1:21:18] he was running from the lord but brother
[1:21:20] branham puts it down or he said
[1:21:22] he was in the perfect will of god it was
[1:21:25] in the perfect will of god when they
[1:21:26] throwed him off he knew what nineveh
[1:21:28] needed
[1:21:28] they needed god amen they needed to know
[1:21:31] the god of israel
[1:21:32] the god of jacob and isaac and i he they
[1:21:34] needed to know who he was amen
[1:21:36] and they looked at that and he said send
[1:21:37] him down her but that that that whale
[1:21:40] that fish swallowed him up it took him
[1:21:43] down onto the bottom hey man i watch my
[1:21:45] fish as soon as i feed them good
[1:21:47] they go right to the bottom of the guppy
[1:21:48] bowl amen they're full i thought about
[1:21:51] it i said you know what that's exactly
[1:21:52] what the devil wants to do to you
[1:21:54] tonight he wants to get you swallowed up
[1:21:56] in something that's sin
[1:21:57] that'll hold you back if it ain't
[1:21:59] nothing but saying i ain't gonna go to
[1:22:00] church tonight
[1:22:01] i feel like it but i ain't gone if it
[1:22:03] ain't nothing but that he's got you at
[1:22:04] the bottom of the bowl
[1:22:05] he gonna take you down or he gonna make
[1:22:06] you feel so bad but i'm gonna tell you
[1:22:08] what it's gonna take god to get you out
[1:22:10] of that hole
[1:22:11] it's gonna take a sacrifice to god
[1:22:13] that's gonna say i need to get on my
[1:22:14] knees and pray to god
[1:22:15] people are talking about wanting to go
[1:22:17] in the rapture and they can't even come
[1:22:18] to church
[1:22:19] hey man you look at you see god's got to
[1:22:20] be inside of you so much it don't matter
[1:22:22] if you were the only one showing up to
[1:22:24] church you'd be there
[1:22:25] and then you have a responsibility
[1:22:27] before god he saved you
[1:22:29] he sanctified you he filled you with the
[1:22:31] holy ghost you should have more desire
[1:22:33] to be in service with god and reading
[1:22:35] the scriptures of god
[1:22:36] not saving it for easter not saving it
[1:22:38] for a sunday morning but saying every
[1:22:40] day i want to get vested more and more
[1:22:42] into it hey man that's what jonah did
[1:22:43] when he was down there in the belly that
[1:22:45] well
[1:22:45] and then he dropped down to his knees
[1:22:47] and he found himself
[1:22:48] all alone black darkness was all
[1:22:51] around him there was nobody down there
[1:22:52] to hold his hand
[1:22:53] there was nobody down there to say this
[1:22:55] is what you need to do he could probably
[1:22:56] hear in the background the echo went off
[1:22:58] you need to go to nineveh you probably
[1:23:02] you need to go to nineveh but he went
[1:23:04] running from the presence of god amen
[1:23:06] but we find him here he is but he is the
[1:23:09] one responsible for praying through
[1:23:12] he had to get himself right with god
[1:23:14] before that fish would come up off of
[1:23:15] there
[1:23:16] and he had to turn his entire life out
[1:23:18] he sacrificed everything
[1:23:20] he had he said i'm not holding back
[1:23:22] nothing whatever you want me to do lord
[1:23:24] i want to do it for you no longer do i
[1:23:27] want to be where i'm at right now right
[1:23:28] now i'm in the belly of hell but i need
[1:23:30] you right now
[1:23:32] amen to chapter two amen let's read that
[1:23:34] just the first scripture there
[1:23:35] amen and jonah prayed unto the lord and
[1:23:38] his god
[1:23:39] out of the fish's belly and he cried i
[1:23:42] cried by reason of mine inflictedly
[1:23:44] affliction unto the lord
[1:23:46] and he heard me and out of the belly of
[1:23:48] hell cried i
[1:23:49] that thou heardest my voice for thou
[1:23:52] hast

[1:41:13] and these people believed his testimony
[1:41:17] and them that did truly believe it
[1:41:20] could god draw blessings on them
[1:41:24] many times we wonder why we're not

[1:41:27] this
[1:41:29] you have not died out to yourself i'm
[1:41:32] going to tell you what if jesus christ
[1:41:34] some 2000 years ago had to sit there in
[1:41:37] the garden of gethsemane
[1:41:40] and he had to he was pleading before god
[1:41:44] these weren't just now lay me down to
[1:41:47] sleep prayers
[1:41:51] getting serious now
[1:41:56] this wasn't god is good and god is great
[1:42:00] these were pleading prayers jesus is
[1:42:03] saying
[1:42:05] he was praying in a garden of gethsemane
[1:42:07] until his tears become his great drops
[1:42:09] of blood
[1:42:11] he was pleading that they would let that
[1:42:13] cut pass from him
[1:42:18] devil didn't know what he was getting
[1:42:19] ready to do
[1:42:22] he was hid from everybody
[1:42:28] god had other plans
[1:42:31] god had other plans
[1:42:36] he was down there on that cross they
[1:42:39] were looking at him
[1:42:40] just a man just like everybody else he's
[1:42:43] bleeding
[1:42:44] brother am talking like this right here
[1:42:45] it says he was dragging it'll cross up
[1:42:47] through there
[1:42:49] he watched him the devil stood back and
[1:42:51] watched him he said
[1:42:52] maybe it's just one splotch of blood
[1:42:54] here and maybe a splotchy blood there
[1:42:57] the further he gone up that old mountain
[1:43:00] he was dying out to himself he's giving
[1:43:03] himself over for you
[1:43:05] that blood continued to pour
[1:43:08] from his body until it just become one
[1:43:12] mass of blood as it was profusing from
[1:43:15] him
[1:43:16] but he was doing that all for you never
[1:43:19] one time did he complain
[1:43:22] every one time
[1:43:26] he kept the faith for you he knew one
[1:43:28] day you would be in that belly of
[1:43:30] hell so one day my son and my daughter
[1:43:34] will be in need i can do this
[1:43:38] they believe upon me and i'll be there
[1:43:41] for them
[1:43:43] god's seen him he's seen you
[1:43:46] we sing the song when he was on the
[1:43:47] cross i was on his mind
[1:43:49] he was god incarnated in flesh
[1:43:53] he came back to save this earth that
[1:43:55] blood fallen from his veins and falling
[1:43:57] upon that ground
[1:43:58] was buying back this earth the footsteps
[1:44:01] that he walked
[1:44:02] were possession he was taking each step
[1:44:05] as he took it he was possessing this
[1:44:07] earth
[1:44:07] he was repossessing redeeming this earth
[1:44:10] the devil couldn't see what was going on
[1:44:12] he couldn't see what was happening in
[1:44:14] front of him he said i've got him
[1:44:16] sting of death had him all around kept
[1:44:18] circling him around and said oh he's
[1:44:20] just a man just like anybody else
[1:44:22] he didn't know what that flesh was a
[1:44:24] manual
[1:44:26] it was emmanuel standing there
[1:44:30] on that cross love held him there love
[1:44:34] held him there

[1:44:41] sitting here tonight
[1:44:42] we could shout all we wanted to we could
[1:44:45] sing all we wanted to
[1:44:46] but it took him on that cross
[1:44:49] it took him when he died when he died he
[1:44:53] went to hell
[1:44:54] he did different when he went to hell
[1:44:56] when he went to the belly of the well of
[1:44:58] hell
[1:44:59] he went down there and started taking
[1:45:00] over amen he started taking over

[1:45:10] went to die amen he didn't go down there
[1:45:12] to plead for his life
[1:45:14] he went down there to preach the souls
[1:45:16] that are in prison now

[1:45:18] branham preached to us what was going on
[1:45:20] he walked us through there how he went
[1:45:22] down and took the keys of death
[1:45:24] and of hell and the grave and how he sat
[1:45:26] there on that cross amen and that little
[1:45:28] bee stinging around there that little
