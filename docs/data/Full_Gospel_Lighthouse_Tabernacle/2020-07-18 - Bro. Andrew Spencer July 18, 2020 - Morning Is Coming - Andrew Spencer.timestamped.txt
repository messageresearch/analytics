[37:37] looking forward
[38:08] there's a lighthouse
[38:11] on a hill that
[38:15] overlooks like see
[38:18] [Music]
[38:20] when i'm tossed it sends out a light
[38:26] that i might see
[38:32] and the light that shines in
[38:36] darkness now will
[38:41] safely lead
[38:43] me over
[38:47] if it wasn't for
[38:51] that lighthouse
[38:55] my ship would sail
[38:59] more
[39:00] [Music]
[39:05] and i thank god for
[39:11] the lighthouse
[39:14] i owe my life
[39:19] to him
[39:23] king jesus is the lighthouse
[39:31] and from the rocks
[39:35] of sin he has
[39:39] [Music]
[39:40] shown
[39:45] [Music]
[39:48] that i could
[39:51] clearly see
[39:55] if it wasn't for
[39:59] that lighthouse

[40:08] be
[40:10] [Music]
[40:16] now everybody that lives about
[40:21] me says
[40:24] tear that lighthouse down
[40:32] see the big ships don't sell
[40:35] that way anymore and there's no
[40:39] use in it standing
[40:43] round

[40:51] to that stormy night
[40:55] when just in time

[41:02] yes the light
[41:04] [Music]
[41:19] and i thank god for
[41:25] the lighthouse
[41:29] i owe my life
[41:33] to him
[41:37] king jesus is
[41:41] the lighthouse
[41:46] and from the rocks
[41:50] of sin he
[41:53] has shown a lie
[41:58] around me
[42:02] that i could clearly see
[42:10] if it wasn't for
[42:14] [Music]
[42:15] that lighthouse

[42:44] amen god has been so good to us to shine
[42:47] his light
[42:48] upon us in this hour that we might see
[42:51] the truth of this day
[42:53] and we can never be grateful enough or
[42:55] thankful enough but we can surely begin
[42:58] to
[42:58] praise him on this side of glory for all
[43:01] the things that he's done for
[43:02] us we can never repay god has been
[43:06] he's been he's been better to me than i
[43:09] could ever be to him
[43:11] but i want to do my very best in life to
[43:13] be able to serve him
[43:15] with every portion of my spirit and soul
[43:19] i want to do my very best humanly
[43:22] capable to be able to serve him
[43:25] and when i'm too weak to serve him may
[43:27] my spirit continue
[43:30] may my soul just begin to reach out in
[43:32] that realm and praise him
[43:34] when i'm unconscious subconscious
[43:36] whatever life may
[43:38] throw at us we want to continually
[43:40] praise the lord jesus christ

[44:10] and just remember them in prayer you
[44:13] know that they're under
[44:14] a great stress load and we see as the
[44:17] enemy is on a rampage he's very upset at
[44:20] the ministry of christ and
[44:22] he's always attacking the ministry and
[44:25] and it seems like if he can't get you
[44:27] he'll
[44:27] try to get to your wife or try to get to
[44:29] your children but we're not going to
[44:31] bend now
[44:32] or back up on god's promises and neither
[44:35] is god but we want to continue to lift

[54:15] amen if you have your bibles this
[54:17] evening we'll
[54:18] return to daniel chapter 6 and verse 16.
[54:24] amen
[54:29] daniel chapter 6 and verse 16.
[54:38] i'd like to to speak uh
[54:43] speak a thought tonight on
[54:47] on morning is coming morning is coming
[54:51] and
[54:52] i know it may i know it may sound simple
[54:55] to you and
[54:56] it may just be a statement to you but
[54:59] maybe if that's all you catch tonight
[55:01] it's a statement of
[55:02] mourning is coming you can realize from
[55:05] that
[55:06] statement that darkness can't last but
[55:08] so long
[55:10] daniel chapter 6 and verse 16.
[55:13] and the bible says then the king
[55:15] commanded and they brought daniel
[55:17] and cast him into the den of lions
[55:21] now the king spake and said unto daniel
[55:23] thy thy god whom thou
[55:26] service continually he will deliver thee
[55:30] now notice the the admiration that the
[55:33] king
[55:34] has for daniel and also
[55:37] the admiration for daniel's god
[55:40] and the stone was brought and laid upon
[55:42] the mouth
[55:43] of the den and the king sealed it with
[55:45] his own signet
[55:47] and with the signet of his lords that
[55:49] the purpose might not be changed
[55:51] concerning daniel
[55:53] then the king went to his palace and
[55:55] passed the night fasting
[55:57] neither were instruments of music
[55:59] brought before him
[56:02] and his sleep went from him
[56:06] then the king arose very early in the
[56:09] morning and went
[56:10] in haste unto the den of lions
[56:14] and when he came to the den he cried
[56:16] with a lamentable voice
[56:18] unto daniel and the king spake and said
[56:21] to daniel o daniel servant
[56:23] of the living god is thy god whom thou
[56:27] serve us continually able to deliver
[56:31] thee
[56:32] from the lions now notice the question
[56:34] of the king
[56:36] o daniel servant of the living god is
[56:38] thy god whom thou
[56:40] serve as continually able to deliver
[56:43] thee
[56:44] from the lions now this has been a rough
[56:46] night
[56:47] it's been a rough night it's been a it's
[56:49] a night that that's been
[56:51] much agony on the king as you see that
[56:53] his sleep
[56:54] has had went away from him but i want
[56:58] you to notice in verse 21 these these
[57:00] very powerful words
[57:02] you may have read over this this
[57:04] statement or read over these scriptures
[57:05] a thousand times
[57:07] it's very familiar scripture to our
[57:08] children but notice
[57:10] these first words then said daniel
[57:14] unto the king
[57:19] now what was meant to be silenced
[57:23] has a voice
[57:27] what was meant to be shut up has a voice
[57:32] i trust you never read over those words
[57:34] the same way again
[57:36] then said daniel unto the king a voice
[57:39] that was meant to be shut up
[57:41] o king live forever my god hath sent his
[57:46] angel and hath shut the lion's mouth
[57:48] that they have not hurt me
[57:50] for as much as before him innocency was
[57:53] found in me
[57:54] and also before thee o king have i done
[57:58] no hurt then was the king
[58:02] exceeding glad for him and commanded
[58:05] that they should take daniel up out of
[58:07] the den
[58:08] so daniel was taken up out of the den
[58:10] and no manner of hurt was found
[58:12] upon him because
[58:16] he believed in his god
[58:20] hallelujah may god bless the reading of
[58:22] the word he may be seated in the
[58:23] presence of the lord
[58:26] turn with thee over to mark chapter 16
[58:30] and verse one
[58:35] morning is coming and the darkness can't
[58:39] stop it
[58:41] mark 16-1 and when the sabbath was
[58:44] passed mary magdalene
[58:46] and mary the mother of james and salome
[58:49] had brought sweet spices that they might
[58:52] come and anoint him and very
[58:56] early in the morning the first day of
[58:58] the week
[58:59] they came unto the sepulcher at the
[59:02] rising
[59:03] of the sun it's always a very
[59:07] magical or maybe that's not the word
[59:09] that we would say but it's a very
[59:11] amazing thing when you step out early in
[59:14] the mornings and
[59:15] it's it's such an hour of utter darkness
[59:18] but you know that if god is still on the
[59:21] throne that there is coming forth a
[59:23] power
[59:24] that will push back all of the darkness
[59:26] that has been there all throughout the
[59:28] nighttime
[59:29] and it's such an amazing thing and it's
[59:31] it's it's actually
[59:33] extraordinary to me as when you wake up
[59:35] early in the morning i believe that the
[59:37] bible said
[59:38] to seek him early in the morning and i
[59:40] believe that sometimes that
[59:42] many people miss a lot of things as is
[59:44] early in the morning times when you
[59:46] should be seeking god and fasting or
[59:49] laying before the lord that those are
[59:51] times in which when all the demon powers
[59:53] of hell have been shut down for the
[59:55] night
[59:56] and that's when the lord of heaven
[59:57] begins to deal with his children
[59:59] is early in the mornings and it's an
[1:00:02] amazing thing when you know and you
[1:00:03] watch
[1:00:04] that great big ball of fire as it comes
[1:00:06] up in the morning and
[1:00:07] you can feel it as it begins to rise
[1:00:09] upon the nature around you and you can
[1:00:11] watch how everything in nature
[1:00:13] begins to testify of the power that is
[1:00:17] on the inside of that ball now it looks
[1:00:19] like a great big yellow ball up there in
[1:00:21] the sky but it has a power
[1:00:23] that everything in earth and everything
[1:00:26] and in the sky
[1:00:27] is testifying of its power and it's so
[1:00:30] powerful
[1:00:31] that every bit of energy that that comes
[1:00:34] that that is seen upon this earth comes
[1:00:37] from this great big ball of fire and
[1:00:39] and we know that science tells us that
[1:00:41] the sun is 93 million miles away from us
[1:00:45] but yet in the morning there is
[1:00:47] something that is so magnificent
[1:00:49] when it begins to shine upon your side
[1:00:52] of the earth
[1:00:53] now that sun's been shining all day long
[1:00:56] all throughout the hours through 24
[1:00:58] hours
[1:00:58] that sun has been shining now maybe you
[1:01:01] can't see it on your side of the earth
[1:01:02] but that sun is shining upon somebody
[1:01:05] else maybe in the western countries
[1:01:06] or in the eastern countries but through
[1:01:08] the night time you're you're there
[1:01:10] and you're looking and you're waiting
[1:01:12] for morning to come
[1:01:14] but you know that morning is coming you
[1:01:17] see
[1:01:17] even josh will realize the power of the
[1:01:20] sun
[1:01:21] because he realized that that if
[1:01:23] darkness would come that the enemy could
[1:01:25] could gather themselves together and
[1:01:27] they could get themselves and they could
[1:01:29] and they could harness harness
[1:01:31] themselves in the darkness you see
[1:01:33] that's where darkness
[1:01:34] is harnessed that's where the enemy
[1:01:36] harnesses its power is in the midst of
[1:01:38] darkness
[1:01:39] but in an hour when it seems like there
[1:01:42] is no sun around
[1:01:44] there is an hour when the moon is there
[1:01:46] and that moon
[1:01:47] is a reflection of the power that comes
[1:01:50] from the sun
[1:01:50] now that moon has no power without the
[1:01:53] sun during the daytime
[1:01:55] but because of the power that is in that
[1:01:57] sun
[1:01:58] it is a reflection and that moon it is a
[1:02:01] reflecting of that light
[1:02:03] and it may be in such a time when you
[1:02:05] feel like there is
[1:02:06] no god around you but there is a bride
[1:02:09] of jesus christ
[1:02:11] that cannot do anything unless he is
[1:02:14] doing it
[1:02:15] and if we do anything apart from the
[1:02:17] groom
[1:02:18] then we are not the bride but if he
[1:02:21] did it as the groom then the bride can
[1:02:23] come in right behind it
[1:02:25] and say thus saith the lord because she
[1:02:28] is testifying
[1:02:29] of the quickening power of almighty god
[1:02:32] that there
[1:02:32] is a s-o-o-s-o-n that is still
[1:02:36] more than able to do all things through
[1:02:39] a people
[1:02:42] there is power in the sun
[1:02:47] now and i want you to notice this just
[1:02:49] to just to kind of set this in place
[1:02:52] brother branham said in what thinking of
[1:02:54] christ and he daniel was given witness
[1:02:56] and he said another thing one day for my
[1:02:59] testimony they throwed me
[1:03:01] into a den of lions while i was standing
[1:03:04] there and the first thing i
[1:03:05] seen and their first thing i
[1:03:09] seen was lines and i heard their soft
[1:03:12] padded paws and i could feel their
[1:03:15] breath
[1:03:15] almost on me in that dark dungeon in a
[1:03:19] few minutes i i'd be tore
[1:03:21] together and all of a sudden something
[1:03:24] moved
[1:03:25] every fiber in my body i felt
[1:03:28] something tingling my face turned
[1:03:31] hot and chills went through me and i i
[1:03:34] seen where the lines the eyes of the
[1:03:36] lions coming
[1:03:37] and the first thing you know they begin
[1:03:39] to turn their head
[1:03:40] and walk away and when i felt when when
[1:03:43] that
[1:03:44] feeling left me i looked standing in the
[1:03:47] corner and there stood
[1:03:49] one who is the son of god standing there
[1:03:52] god had sent his angels to deliver me
[1:03:54] and i can hear him say that power
[1:03:57] that was upon me my muscles were just
[1:03:59] shaking
[1:04:00] the power that was going through me
[1:04:02] tears was coming down my cheeks
[1:04:04] he's the son of god
[1:04:08] i wonder today what think ye of christ
[1:04:12] when you were going through a midst of
[1:04:13] darkness in the midst of trouble
[1:04:15] what think ye of christ did you see that
[1:04:18] one that would walk with the
[1:04:20] walk with the three hebrew children and
[1:04:22] he would be the fourth man in the fire
[1:04:25] brother danny steamon wrote us a note
[1:04:27] one time he said there is plenty of room
[1:04:29] in this fire for the fourth man and i
[1:04:32] want you to know we're not
[1:04:33] out of it yet we may be seeing signs of
[1:04:36] victories
[1:04:37] but there's still plenty of room for the
[1:04:39] fourth man
[1:04:40] when i get on the outside of the fire
[1:04:42] there's still plenty of room for him
[1:04:45] are you with me and before daniel ever
[1:04:47] got put in the lion's den
[1:04:49] there was an angel that was on his way
[1:04:53] but i want you to notice the attachment
[1:04:55] of the king with daniel
[1:04:57] i want you to see how he loved daniel
[1:05:00] how that he respected daniel
[1:05:02] and it showed the love that that the
[1:05:04] king had for daniel
[1:05:06] that his sleep had went away from him
[1:05:08] all throughout the night
[1:05:10] i want you to know that there's a god
[1:05:12] that's got his eye on you
[1:05:13] he is the king of kings and he is the
[1:05:15] lord of lords
[1:05:17] there is a special attachment between
[1:05:19] you
[1:05:20] and him and there's not going to be
[1:05:22] nothing that goes on that will tear that
[1:05:24] apart
[1:05:25] though the enemy try to strip you of
[1:05:27] your health and strip you of your wealth
[1:05:29] and
[1:05:30] strip you of your family there will be
[1:05:32] an attachment
[1:05:33] with the king of kings no matter what
[1:05:37] you go through in 2020
[1:05:39] he's still got his eye on you are you
[1:05:42] with me he still got his eye on you
[1:05:44] this this year that we're living in it
[1:05:47] is a 2020 it's a year of perfect vision
[1:05:50] it's a year it's a year in which nobody
[1:05:53] wish
[1:05:54] we there's a lot of things that have
[1:05:55] happened and a lot of people would wish
[1:05:57] some things away
[1:05:58] but at the year of 2020 it's a day an
[1:06:00] hour that we're living in utter chaos
[1:06:03] there's not one of you that's not been
[1:06:05] affected by 2020.
[1:06:07] there's not a one of you that's sitting
[1:06:08] here that are doing the same things that
[1:06:10] you were doing in 2019
[1:06:12] you're doing it now in some way in some
[1:06:14] form you're doing
[1:06:16] something different because of what 2020
[1:06:19] has brought behind it there's been
[1:06:20] statements that have been said
[1:06:22] that 2020 has had a bad hair day every
[1:06:24] day
[1:06:25] it's been said that 2020 needs to have a
[1:06:28] snickers it's been said that 2020
[1:06:30] has been all kinds of shook up you see
[1:06:33] everybody has been affected by 2020.
[1:06:37] there's been everybody that's been
[1:06:38] affected by covet in some way
[1:06:40] though you may not feel like it's real
[1:06:42] and maybe you don't believe in covet or
[1:06:44] whatever it may be
[1:06:45] there are people there are things that
[1:06:47] you cannot do
[1:06:49] because of an a a an invisible enemy out
[1:06:52] there that you can't see
[1:06:54] so every person has been through
[1:06:56] something maybe you believe it's real
[1:06:58] maybe you don't believe it's real but i
[1:07:00] know that there's a real devil out there
[1:07:02] that is doing his best to try to stop
[1:07:04] the move of god
[1:07:07] but this year has been rough on every
[1:07:10] person
[1:07:10] there's not been a person on the face of
[1:07:12] the earth that has not
[1:07:14] been affected by covet 19 or by 2020
[1:07:17] it's been a rough year for believers but
[1:07:20] in a situation like this
[1:07:22] it has been a year of miracles
[1:07:25] it's been a year in which we has to look
[1:07:28] back and testify
[1:07:29] that god has been with us are you with
[1:07:32] me so we see that there's no miracle
[1:07:34] without a mess
[1:07:35] and if you look at 20 20 and a hole it's
[1:07:38] a perfect
[1:07:39] set up for god to show forth and to
[1:07:41] declare his power
[1:07:43] that he is jehovah
[1:07:45] [Music]
[1:07:46] so if you're looking for a spot to see a
[1:07:48] miracle
[1:07:49] you have showed up to 2020 where you can
[1:07:53] look out upon
[1:07:54] 2020 with perfect vision by a prophetic
[1:07:57] eagle age
[1:07:58] that you're living in and you can see
[1:08:00] that there's a people
[1:08:01] that will overcome 2020 we won't just
[1:08:04] barely pass through
[1:08:06] we're going to come through on the other
[1:08:08] side of this saying
[1:08:10] winning every victory that stands in
[1:08:12] front of us
[1:08:24] morning is coming it's dark out there
[1:08:28] if you if you've lived for very much
[1:08:31] long a very long time you realize that
[1:08:33] it's very dark outside
[1:08:35] no i'm not talking about the light
[1:08:37] outside right now i'm talking about the
[1:08:38] spiritual
[1:08:39] the spiritual thermometer upon the world
[1:08:42] and you look out and all you see is
[1:08:44] complete laotia
[1:08:46] and you look out and you see that when
[1:08:48] the light is not there that there is
[1:08:49] darkness that is coming
[1:08:51] and you look out upon the coldness of
[1:08:53] the lukewarmness of laodicea and its
[1:08:56] affecting everybody
[1:08:58] there's not one believer that's sitting
[1:09:00] here tonight that would testify that
[1:09:01] they were not affected by laodicea this
[1:09:04] week
[1:09:05] i'd say ever i'd say 100 whether you
[1:09:07] want to agree with me or tonight
[1:09:09] or not you have been affected by
[1:09:11] laodicea in some way
[1:09:13] good or bad you have been affected by it
[1:09:16] but i want to i want to bring it to your
[1:09:19] attention
[1:09:20] that there is a god that is with you
[1:09:23] when you don't
[1:09:24] feel like he's with you there is there
[1:09:27] is a time in which you can't be with
[1:09:28] your pastor
[1:09:29] can't be with your friends can't be with
[1:09:32] your loved ones or be with the deacon
[1:09:33] board to be able to rely upon somebody
[1:09:36] that you can lay your hands on and they
[1:09:37] can lay hands on you and you get through
[1:09:39] the day
[1:09:40] it's a time when you don't feel like
[1:09:42] anything's working
[1:09:44] he is working a way to bring about his
[1:09:47] miracle
[1:09:48] working power through you
[1:09:57] now i want you to know i want you to
[1:09:59] think about this maybe
[1:10:00] maybe you've been in a spot like this
[1:10:03] before
[1:10:04] you ever been in a spot when you knew
[1:10:06] something was coming
[1:10:08] you just knew it was coming it was a
[1:10:10] perfect it was a perfect setup
[1:10:12] that you knew something was coming
[1:10:16] but the moment that it comes
[1:10:20] that the event that you know is coming
[1:10:23] when it comes the event
[1:10:26] is greater than what you expected
[1:10:30] you ever been in a spot like that when
[1:10:32] you were expecting
[1:10:34] you expecting a happy meal
[1:10:38] and you get the big mac
[1:10:43] but have you ever walked through life
[1:10:47] you ever walk through life and you know
[1:10:49] that something is coming that there's
[1:10:50] something that's going to work out for
[1:10:52] your good
[1:10:54] but when it comes it's so much more
[1:10:58] it's so much more greater than what you
[1:11:00] expected
[1:11:01] i want you to know just to relate some
[1:11:03] of my heart to you this evening
[1:11:05] there have been some times in this
[1:11:07] journey where there have been
[1:11:09] utter darkness completely surrounding me
[1:11:12] as a mortal being there have been times
[1:11:15] in this journey when i thought oh god
[1:11:17] if you don't show up i don't know what's
[1:11:20] going to take place there's been some
[1:11:21] spots i'm going to
[1:11:22] i'm going to i'm going to open myself up
[1:11:25] and make myself vulnerable to you
[1:11:27] tonight
[1:11:27] so that you get what i'm saying but
[1:11:29] there have been some spots when it was
[1:11:32] all dark around me i remember taking a
[1:11:35] walk up through my woods one day
[1:11:37] and it was some bad news that was
[1:11:39] dropping down from headquarters over in
[1:11:41] uva
[1:11:41] and they didn't made up their mind that
[1:11:43] that this was what they was going to do
[1:11:45] and if this don't work
[1:11:46] we don't know what we're going to do and
[1:11:48] i had myself a good old walk with jesus
[1:11:51] and i as i begin to walk i began to go
[1:11:54] through there and just
[1:11:55] begin to lay out my heart before god and
[1:11:57] now i don't know why i'm
[1:11:58] making myself vulnerable like this but
[1:12:00] god's got a reason in doing it
[1:12:02] i told dad before service this is going
[1:12:04] to be one of those sermons kind of like
[1:12:05] riding a horse you don't know which way
[1:12:06] it's going to take you but here
[1:12:08] here i am making this walk and i could
[1:12:12] feel the darkness you ever been in a
[1:12:14] spot where it's so dark
[1:12:15] you ever been down in a cave when you
[1:12:17] could feel the darkness it was
[1:12:19] it was actually penetrating the darkness
[1:12:21] was actually penetrating
[1:12:23] and it felt like everything around you
[1:12:25] was was affected
[1:12:26] by the darkness you all know what i mean
[1:12:28] and here i am walking
[1:12:30] and all of a sudden it just begin to
[1:12:32] drop in my heart
[1:12:33] that i've got this i know that he had it
[1:12:36] the whole time there's not nothing in my
[1:12:38] faith that wavered
[1:12:39] but you know sometimes you're on an
[1:12:40] emotional roller coaster
[1:12:42] and you're going every which away from
[1:12:43] straight and i was going through these
[1:12:46] things
[1:12:46] and i finally reached down to a spot
[1:12:50] and i said now look here satan i'm not
[1:12:52] going to it's either going to be me and
[1:12:54] you standing here
[1:12:55] and i'm not leaving off of what god said
[1:12:58] so you might as well go ahead and leave
[1:13:00] so i went ahead and started blessing the
[1:13:02] name of jesus
[1:13:03] i began to tell him all the things that
[1:13:05] i was going through all the things that
[1:13:07] i was facing as a young pastor
[1:13:09] all the things that i was looking at and
[1:13:11] going through at that time
[1:13:12] looking at the enemy that had tried to
[1:13:14] come and steal my dad and
[1:13:16] steal my pastor still my best friend it
[1:13:19] looked like
[1:13:19] darkness was all around and at that time
[1:13:23] i began to see as the light began to
[1:13:25] break over top of me
[1:13:26] that darkness could not stay when i was
[1:13:29] praising
[1:13:30] the one that had all power in heaven
[1:13:33] and in earth if you would go to praising
[1:13:36] god tonight
[1:13:37] i wonder what would break loose in this
[1:13:40] place
[1:13:41] you come to a place that is a perfect
[1:13:44] place
[1:13:44] for you to get transformed you walked in
[1:13:47] here with all kinds of utter chaos
[1:13:49] that's went on in the last week and
[1:13:51] you've got all kinds of baggage that you
[1:13:53] don't know what to do with
[1:13:54] but you have found a perfect spot to
[1:13:57] drop off your luggage
[1:13:59] this is not a tsa protection or an order
[1:14:02] that you go through and do this
[1:14:03] but i'm telling you that there is a
[1:14:05] conveyor line where you can drop off
[1:14:07] your baggage
[1:14:10] and you don't have to pick it back up at
[1:14:12] the end of the road
[1:14:17] the reason why people love their luggage
[1:14:20] is because what's in that luggage is
[1:14:22] them
[1:14:24] and they don't want to get rid of the
[1:14:25] luggage
[1:14:27] because they're in love with the luggage
[1:14:30] but oh
[1:14:30] if you could ever let loose i wonder
[1:14:34] what would really transpire in a service
[1:14:36] like this
[1:14:38] if you would really go to letting
[1:14:40] yourself loose
[1:14:41] and you begin to bless the lord and you
[1:14:44] begin to praise his name
[1:14:46] and you begin to trust him with your
[1:14:47] life trust him with your mind
[1:14:49] trust him with yourself that's a big one
[1:14:52] right there but you begin to trust him
[1:14:54] with your whole life i wonder what would
[1:14:56] really cut loose in this place
[1:14:58] if you gave your absolute all
[1:15:01] in your praise in your worship in your
[1:15:04] atmosphere and everything
[1:15:06] what would happen if you would let
[1:15:08] yourself loose i'd say that it would be
[1:15:11] a rocking and a reeling down in hell
[1:15:13] because there's a people that have
[1:15:15] refused to receive
[1:15:17] what the devil's tried to give to them
[1:15:26] hallelujah
[1:15:29] hallelujah surely odyssey is dark
[1:15:34] sure the chaos of the world is dark but
[1:15:36] what about the god that's on your side
[1:15:39] don't forget the power of the s-o-n
[1:15:42] when it sets on the inside of your soul
[1:15:44] it'll make you talk in a different
[1:15:46] language
[1:15:47] it'll make you dance it'll make you
[1:15:49] shout it'll make you lose
[1:15:51] outside of your fears
[1:15:54] sure cancer is bad sure tumors are bad
[1:15:58] sure brain bleeds are bad but there is a
[1:16:00] god that's greater than the bad
[1:16:07] sure daniel was in there all night long
[1:16:09] but he knew that morning was coming
[1:16:13] sure the things you're going through is
[1:16:14] dark sure they're going to hurt you
[1:16:19] you may you may you may not be like
[1:16:22] daniel
[1:16:23] and walk out unharmed you may actually
[1:16:27] have some scars
[1:16:30] not every situation is perfect
[1:16:35] but i want to point you to a god that is
[1:16:40] you'll watch somebody that is scarred by
[1:16:42] adultery
[1:16:44] and they're scarred by things in their
[1:16:46] pastor and their parents past you watch
[1:16:48] every time that it's mentioned
[1:16:50] they begin to put up a wall
[1:16:53] they begin to put up a blockage and they
[1:16:55] don't want to go there because it's too
[1:16:56] hard it's too harmful for their own
[1:17:01] personal walk that they will not walk
[1:17:03] down that path
[1:17:05] but if they could ever let themselves
[1:17:07] loose that god is a healer
[1:17:11] walk with me down this path for a minute
[1:17:13] there's some there's some dark roads
[1:17:15] that are in front of you that are
[1:17:17] scarful
[1:17:18] they're hurtful but if you could ever
[1:17:20] let let loose
[1:17:21] that god is a healer that he'll heal all
[1:17:24] of your broken heart
[1:17:25] that he'll hell he'll heal every
[1:17:27] situation
[1:17:28] that you're going through if you can let
[1:17:30] yourself loose to walk down that path
[1:17:32] with me tonight
[1:17:33] i want you to i want to tell you that
[1:17:35] when you come out on the other side of
[1:17:37] that thing
[1:17:38] that you're so vulnerable that you don't
[1:17:40] want to go into that
[1:17:41] you don't want to talk about it you just
[1:17:43] want to shut everything up around you
[1:17:46] and you don't want to talk about it you
[1:17:48] need to have a talk
[1:17:49] with jesus
[1:18:01] what we're seeing is none other than a
[1:18:04] move of god
[1:18:08] what you're seeing how many loves you
[1:18:12] pastor
[1:18:14] amen
[1:18:22] what you're seeing in your pastor is
[1:18:24] none other than a move of god
[1:18:28] what we have seen through these last six
[1:18:31] months and i'm using this
[1:18:32] last six months is your life just now
[1:18:35] but what we've seen in these last six
[1:18:37] months
[1:18:37] is none other than jesus and i was
[1:18:40] having a conversation
[1:18:42] with my buddy brother jason jackson and
[1:18:44] we were just speaking over these things
[1:18:46] that
[1:18:46] he said you know he said i know it
[1:18:48] wasn't easy to put all your trust in him
[1:18:51] when it looks so dark but i realize
[1:18:54] that it's the darkest right before dawn
[1:18:59] and that morning is coming
[1:19:02] you see you that are hunters and you
[1:19:04] ever been out sitting in the tree stand
[1:19:06] a little bit early
[1:19:08] easy you've been sitting out there a
[1:19:11] little early and you realize
[1:19:12] and you're trying to get to your spot
[1:19:14] before anything else gets to moving and
[1:19:16] you're sitting out there
[1:19:17] and it is dark that is when
[1:19:21] right before dawn it's its darkest
[1:19:23] moment
[1:19:24] it's also the coldest moment because
[1:19:27] darkness is
[1:19:28] pushing itself together because it knows
[1:19:31] that there's a power
[1:19:32] that's rising up on the other side you
[1:19:36] see that power
[1:19:37] is always there that power
[1:19:40] is not leaving he's not changing where
[1:19:43] he's at
[1:19:44] everything else around it can rotate but
[1:19:46] it stays
[1:19:48] stable
[1:19:55] and it's just before the darkest
[1:19:58] you've been sitting out there you got
[1:20:00] the best of gear you got the sitka gear
[1:20:03] you dressed up to the nines in the tree
[1:20:05] stand
[1:20:05] and man and somebody walked through from
[1:20:07] mossy oak man they get your picture in a
[1:20:09] minute
[1:20:11] but it's right there on the edge of edge
[1:20:14] of
[1:20:14] light coming man it gets cold
[1:20:18] and here you are you are in a moment of
[1:20:22] time when it's the coldest that it's
[1:20:26] ever been
[1:20:28] it's negative 40 spiritually speaking
[1:20:32] and ain't nobody on fire for god outside
[1:20:35] of you
[1:20:38] i know it's hard to swallow but swallow
[1:20:40] that thing
[1:20:42] you sitting there in a spot when nobody
[1:20:45] is rejoicing you're sitting in a spot
[1:20:47] where nobody else is in revival
[1:20:49] and you don't have to have emotion just
[1:20:52] to get a just to know that god is there
[1:20:55] you don't have to have fast preaching to
[1:20:57] know that god is there
[1:20:58] you don't have to have loud services to
[1:21:01] know god is there
[1:21:02] but you can sit there in the stillness
[1:21:04] of a moment and you can realize that god
[1:21:07] is right there watching you in your
[1:21:10] utter chaos of life and when nobody else
[1:21:14] is rejoicing you're taking a look around
[1:21:16] and say my jesus
[1:21:18] am i the only one that's getting this
[1:21:26] what is it the light shining
[1:21:30] on you
[1:21:37] you see darkness has zero harmony with
[1:21:41] light
[1:21:44] because if one exists the other has to
[1:21:48] be displaced
[1:21:49] you remember when john in the book of
[1:21:51] john it tells us that
[1:21:53] that the light shined in darkness but
[1:21:55] the darkness comprehended if it not
[1:21:58] you see it's saying to us that jesus
[1:22:01] alight
[1:22:02] was shining upon ignorant men but they
[1:22:04] would not receive it
[1:22:06] because of darkness that was
[1:22:09] that was working all around them you see
[1:22:12] but
[1:22:12] darkness cannot stay in the presence
[1:22:16] of the light it cannot do that because
[1:22:18] light is 10 million times
[1:22:20] stronger than darkness so light and
[1:22:24] darkness cannot dwell together just like
[1:22:27] when your sin
[1:22:28] falls into the blood of jesus christ it
[1:22:31] cannot
[1:22:32] dwell together you have to make a choice
[1:22:35] whether it's going to be your sin
[1:22:37] or it's going to be the blood of jesus
[1:22:38] christ you're going to make a choice
[1:22:40] whether it's going to be your luggage or
[1:22:42] it's going to be the blood of jesus
[1:22:44] christ
[1:22:45] i know what i chose a long time ago when
[1:22:47] i had so much baggage
[1:22:49] as a pastor's kid that nobody wanted to
[1:22:52] talk to me
[1:22:52] that nobody wanted to be friends with me
[1:22:55] when everybody gave up on me
[1:22:57] but the blood didn't give up
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:04] some of the same critics that are
[1:23:05] criticizing you
[1:23:07] are the people that would have never
[1:23:09] allowed me in a pulpit
[1:23:11] that would never allow me to overcoming
[1:23:13] life and it's saying
[1:23:14] so those same critics that need the
[1:23:17] blood of jesus christ
[1:23:19] it's those same critics that never can
[1:23:21] overcome and
[1:23:22] overcome one day in their life much less
[1:23:25] a year
[1:23:26] but it's the blood that has put me in
[1:23:29] this pulpit
[1:23:30] it's the blood that covered my sin it's
[1:23:32] the blood
[1:23:33] that washes away all of my iniquities
[1:23:37] sure there was some baggage in my life
[1:23:39] there was drugs in my life
[1:23:41] there was all kinds of filthy things in
[1:23:43] my life but one day i heard a voice it
[1:23:46] said
[1:23:46] morning it's coming
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:52] oh hallelujah suicide
[1:23:56] couldn't stay in the picture when the
[1:23:59] morning
[1:24:00] begin to rise
[1:24:02] [Applause]
[1:24:12] hallelujah
[1:24:15] hallelujah
[1:24:18] there's a legend
[1:24:21] just a story there's a legend
[1:24:25] about this cave that was one time having
[1:24:28] a conversation
[1:24:30] with the son this cave began to
[1:24:35] expose itself a little bit begin to talk
[1:24:39] remember it's just a story you believe
[1:24:41] in a cave talking we need to
[1:24:43] have more than prayer
[1:24:47] but the cave was having a conversation
[1:24:50] of the son and he began to tell him
[1:24:52] man it's so dark in here nobody comes to
[1:24:55] me
[1:24:57] nobody comes nobody begins to converse
[1:24:59] with me
[1:25:00] i'm so scared here it makes me draw back
[1:25:03] in my innermost being and i don't want
[1:25:05] to i don't want to step out and i don't
[1:25:07] want to
[1:25:08] i don't i don't know what to do because
[1:25:09] i'm so scared of the dark
[1:25:12] and the sun began to talk to him said
[1:25:14] well how about i come down there
[1:25:16] and i'll take a look around your cave
[1:25:18] and see what's really so scary about it
[1:25:21] so the sun comes down into the cave and
[1:25:24] it begins to take a look all around
[1:25:26] and it begins to look through the cave
[1:25:27] and it says i don't see nothing scary in
[1:25:29] here
[1:25:30] see but but it's so dark he said i don't
[1:25:32] see no darkness here
[1:25:33] you see when the sun comes
[1:25:36] there's no darkness
[1:25:41] when the sun comes there's nothing scary
[1:25:43] about it
[1:25:44] oh hallelujah i can walk i can walk
[1:25:46] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:25:48] death
[1:25:48] as long as i know that there's a sun
[1:25:50] with me i can walk through hell
[1:25:53] as long as i know there's a sun with me
[1:25:55] i can walk through cancer
[1:25:56] as long as i know there's a sun with me
[1:25:59] i can walk through trials
[1:26:00] as long as i know the sun is with me i
[1:26:03] know
[1:26:05] that there is no such a thing as
[1:26:07] darkness
[1:26:08] when the s-o-n begins to shine
[1:26:11] down on me
[1:26:18] when the children of israel was put in
[1:26:21] babylon
[1:26:24] man they had some trials they had to
[1:26:28] stand alone
[1:26:30] but before you can ever have a victory
[1:26:33] you got to have some trials
[1:26:37] are you with me before before you can
[1:26:39] ever have a victory you're gonna have
[1:26:40] you have to have a war
[1:26:43] but you see i want you to notice this
[1:26:45] that you don't have to give out your
[1:26:47] resume to god
[1:26:50] you don't have to go through life and
[1:26:51] show god what you can do and what you
[1:26:53] can't do
[1:26:54] you don't have to go through god you
[1:26:55] don't have to go through your resume of
[1:26:57] life and tell god well i did this and
[1:26:59] i did this i'm capable of doing this and
[1:27:01] i'm not capable of doing that
[1:27:02] god don't need your resume god knows
[1:27:05] everything about you
[1:27:06] god knows what you've been through he
[1:27:08] knows what you're going to go through
[1:27:10] he knows how to bring you out on the
[1:27:11] other side of things completely
[1:27:13] and perfectly whole god knows everything
[1:27:16] about you
[1:27:17] because if you were a gene of god you
[1:27:20] were in god at the very beginning
[1:27:22] before there was a molecule or an
[1:27:24] attribute of anything that was ever
[1:27:26] spoke
[1:27:27] if you were in god's mind there is going
[1:27:29] to be nothing
[1:27:30] that can come by your way that can rob
[1:27:33] you from being in his
[1:27:34] in his throne being in him being a part
[1:27:37] of him
[1:27:38] if you were in god at the very beginning
[1:27:41] as a germ of god so god placed this germ
[1:27:45] on the inside of you
[1:27:47] that gene seed of god and he knew what
[1:27:50] the capacity of your seed
[1:27:52] could handle now god knows if he can
[1:27:55] trust you
[1:27:56] god knows that he can have if you can
[1:27:58] handle the responsibility of preaching
[1:28:00] he knows that if you can handle the
[1:28:01] responsibility of song leading
[1:28:03] he knows if you can handle the
[1:28:04] responsibility as being a lay member or
[1:28:07] whatnot
[1:28:08] god knows the capacity of that seed
[1:28:11] and he knows what he's deposited and
[1:28:13] sometimes people get so
[1:28:14] upset because they can't produce a
[1:28:16] hundred when they're only
[1:28:23] when they're only a 30 seed
[1:28:30] but in the elect god knows what he has
[1:28:33] deposited
[1:28:34] and he knows what he's going to get out
[1:28:36] you see when god had deposited the seeds
[1:28:39] before time he placed those seeds in the
[1:28:42] earth
[1:28:42] and he said let there be light and when
[1:28:45] the light began to shine over the
[1:28:47] darkness
[1:28:47] it began to bring out in the firmament
[1:28:50] it began to bring out in the earth
[1:28:52] all of the seeds that was deposited by
[1:28:54] his spoken word
[1:28:56] he begin to release by the quickening
[1:28:58] power of the
[1:28:59] s-u-n now god knows exactly what he has
[1:29:02] deposited
[1:29:03] now there might be some here brother
[1:29:05] brennan will tell us that there's three
[1:29:06] kind of believers in every church
[1:29:07] service
[1:29:08] make believers real believers and
[1:29:09] unbelievers now god knows what he has
[1:29:12] deposited on the inside of you
[1:29:13] and if you are an unbeliever that same
[1:29:16] power that rolls over to a real believer
[1:29:18] will not affect you in any way you can
[1:29:20] feel the tingle run over top of you and
[1:29:22] you say whoa
[1:29:23] i got it but this is not upon emotions
[1:29:26] this is upon what is going on that's on
[1:29:29] the inside
[1:29:30] where the seed has been deposited and
[1:29:32] when there is no motion
[1:29:34] and when there is no style of fiery
[1:29:36] preaching that soul says
[1:29:38] that's for me
[1:29:41] hallelujah so many times people get
[1:29:43] acquainted or get attached to a style of
[1:29:45] preaching
[1:29:46] and they say well i like that style of
[1:29:47] preaching but the style of preaching
[1:29:49] does not change the anointing
[1:29:53] are you with me i've been in services
[1:29:55] where i heard people talk with such a
[1:29:57] monotone
[1:29:58] monotone voice and you think my am i
[1:30:00] ever going to get anything out of this
[1:30:02] but it would be the most powerful
[1:30:04] service you ever been in
[1:30:06] and then i've been in services man a guy
[1:30:09] could tear the chandeliers down and i
[1:30:10] didn't get nothing out of it
[1:30:12] because it does not change in styles of
[1:30:15] preaching
[1:30:16] neither does the piano change are you
[1:30:18] with me let me give it to you like this
[1:30:19] a piano don't change
[1:30:20] because somebody plays pentecostal or
[1:30:23] they pick or they begin to play in
[1:30:24] classical or different ways
[1:30:26] it does not change the piano
[1:30:30] it only changes the style now there is a
[1:30:33] gene seed of god that is going to come
[1:30:36] forth
[1:30:36] and is going to produce no matter what
[1:30:38] style it's under
[1:30:39] the anointing souls the anointing shows
[1:30:43] what is really
[1:30:44] on the inside of you
[1:30:48] that anointing is a very powerful thing
[1:30:50] some of you sit here
[1:30:52] and maybe never say a man or never clap
[1:30:54] your hands but some of you so genuine
[1:30:56] gold
[1:30:57] that the devil can't do nothing with you
[1:31:01] i'll take you every day of the week
[1:31:05] but i wouldn't give 10 cents for a penny
[1:31:12] i wouldn't give 10 cents for a penny but
[1:31:14] i'll look
[1:31:15] out upon this congregation i don't
[1:31:16] believe there's too many pennies sitting
[1:31:18] here
[1:31:18] i believe there's some real silver
[1:31:19] dollars that are sitting here sure
[1:31:21] there's going to be some accusers
[1:31:23] that try to mock and make fun of joseph
[1:31:25] but joseph what was inside of joseph
[1:31:28] could not be changed and it could not be
[1:31:30] stopped because it was on the inside of
[1:31:32] him
[1:31:33] oh hallelujah and joseph could live
[1:31:35] right
[1:31:36] joseph could stand right and he didn't
[1:31:38] even have a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:31:41] but what about the real silver dollars
[1:31:43] in this day
[1:31:44] that can live and overcome in life when
[1:31:46] every demon in hell
[1:31:47] wants to shut us down you still overcome
[1:31:50] you still win you still have the victory
[1:31:55] it must show you something
[1:31:59] it's what's inside of you
[1:32:05] you look over at revelations chapter 9
[1:32:07] you begin to look at all the scriptures
[1:32:09] and you begin to see the smoke that
[1:32:11] comes out of the bottomless pit and you
[1:32:13] can look at those two hundred thousand
[1:32:14] thousand
[1:32:15] horses and those demons that rise out of
[1:32:17] the river euphrates
[1:32:19] and you look at those things and begin
[1:32:20] to look at it and you see it those
[1:32:22] demons are released
[1:32:24] you see they were bound in the river
[1:32:26] euphrates for 2000 years
[1:32:28] and they were there waiting and when the
[1:32:30] seals released those
[1:32:31] those are those 200 000 000 demons were
[1:32:34] released out of the river euphrates
[1:32:36] now what these are are fallen angels now
[1:32:39] these are fallen angels you can look
[1:32:41] over in isaiah 14
[1:32:42] and 12 and you can see where we're
[1:32:44] lucifer the son of the morning it was
[1:32:46] falling
[1:32:47] and you can read over in jude chapter 1
[1:32:48] and verse 6 and you can see of their
[1:32:50] first estate
[1:32:52] and you can look at these things as a
[1:32:53] fallen fallen creation
[1:32:55] and you see these things they were
[1:32:56] created to worship god
[1:32:59] they were created to be able to they
[1:33:01] were able to be able to worship and
[1:33:03] praise god and
[1:33:04] sing holy holy unto the lord but because
[1:33:08] of their fall they they were a fallen
[1:33:11] angel
[1:33:12] but notice they lost their position
[1:33:15] but they did not lose their power and
[1:33:17] you watch as young people are battling
[1:33:20] and you see them as a battling music and
[1:33:22] you identify what spirit is coming from
[1:33:25] it'll tell you that there is a a realm
[1:33:28] of darkness that has a control on young
[1:33:31] people
[1:33:32] and there are those angels that were
[1:33:34] built to worship
[1:33:35] that know how to enter into music and so
[1:33:38] slip
[1:33:38] in and bring about oh my such such crazy
[1:33:42] nonsense called music
[1:33:45] but you watch the attachment of young
[1:33:47] people
[1:33:48] and you source back that attachment and
[1:33:51] if it's leading them to suicide if it's
[1:33:53] leading them to depression
[1:33:54] you source back their music and it'll
[1:33:56] tell you which realm it's coming from
[1:33:59] but you can source back a bride and you
[1:34:02] can look at her and you can look at her
[1:34:04] atmosphere you can look at her power you
[1:34:05] can see what realm she is
[1:34:08] influenced by are you with me so we see
[1:34:11] that here
[1:34:12] there's two hundred thousand thousand
[1:34:15] horses of demons that are released in
[1:34:17] this day
[1:34:18] now these were not natural horses they
[1:34:20] were spiritual devils
[1:34:22] because they were breathing fire and out
[1:34:24] of their mouth
[1:34:25] is how they would hurt now you watch
[1:34:28] watch those things
[1:34:29] watch revelations 9 and you look at the
[1:34:31] chaos of rudder revelations 9
[1:34:33] but then it rolls over into revelations
[1:34:36] 10
[1:34:37] and it says and i saw another mighty
[1:34:40] angel
[1:34:40] now you're either going to be influenced
[1:34:42] by the realm of darkness or the realm of
[1:34:44] light
[1:34:48] and you look out upon the attack of the
[1:34:49] ministry of this hour
[1:34:51] you see brother brother ron spencer you
[1:34:53] see brother donnie reagan you see his
[1:34:55] daughter you see brother tim and you see
[1:34:57] you see sister karen and you see all of
[1:34:59] these other events
[1:35:00] as the bride of jesus christ is being
[1:35:02] attacked
[1:35:05] you look at these things and you realize
[1:35:07] where the attack is coming from
[1:35:11] it's coming from a power that had been
[1:35:13] bound
[1:35:14] for 2 000 years brother branham said in
[1:35:17] the feast of trumpets
[1:35:19] he said he said that those those those
[1:35:21] demons
[1:35:22] have been bound there for 2 000 years he
[1:35:25] said but the church
[1:35:26] had bound the holy ghost for the same
[1:35:28] amount of two thousand years
[1:35:30] he said it was not bound in the river
[1:35:32] euphrates but it was bound by church
[1:35:34] doors by creeds
[1:35:35] and by dogmas he said but i'm telling
[1:35:37] you that there is coming
[1:35:39] and the church is going to be liberated
[1:35:42] by the holy ghost
[1:35:43] and there's not going to be nothing that
[1:35:45] the demons of hell will be able to stop
[1:35:48] the move of god
[1:35:49] when the holy ghost goes to moving when
[1:35:51] the holy ghost goes to acting
[1:35:53] it's been liberated over a people and
[1:35:55] there's not one demon power
[1:35:57] that has enough to stop to stop the move
[1:36:01] of god
[1:36:02] they can bring all of their imps they
[1:36:04] can bring two hundred thousand
[1:36:05] thousand of them that ain't been
[1:36:07] released for two thousand years
[1:36:08] and they will never stop this almighty
[1:36:12] power
[1:36:14] i'd say this horse we got's a pretty
[1:36:16] good one
[1:36:20] hallelujah you watch a people that's
[1:36:24] influenced by the realm of darkness
[1:36:27] they're so bound up in depression
[1:36:29] bound up in jealousy bound up in all
[1:36:31] types of things
[1:36:32] they're bound up in themselves and you
[1:36:34] watch which realm they're influenced by
[1:36:37] but you begin to watch the children of
[1:36:38] god that's been liberated by an almighty
[1:36:41] power
[1:36:42] you watch they'll dance different
[1:36:44] they'll walk different
[1:36:45] they'll talk different they'll work
[1:36:47] different
[1:36:48] because there is a liberation that is
[1:36:51] taking place on the inside of her soul
[1:36:58] mourning's coming sure he's going to
[1:37:02] attack you
[1:37:05] the attack does not change who you are
[1:37:14] it does not change who you are sure is
[1:37:16] going to attack you
[1:37:19] they lost their position but they did
[1:37:20] not lose their power
[1:37:22] and they hate you because of your
[1:37:24] position
[1:37:27] they hate you for everything that you
[1:37:30] stand up for
[1:37:31] they hate you for all that is good and
[1:37:33] all that is right
[1:37:34] they hate you and they're going to
[1:37:36] attack you but they do not attack you
[1:37:39] because you are weak they attack you
[1:37:41] because you are strong
[1:37:43] they attack you because they know that
[1:37:45] you're going to win
[1:37:47] they attack you and the attack does not
[1:37:49] show
[1:37:50] does not mean and it does not weaken you
[1:37:53] the attack shows
[1:37:54] who you are hallelujah
[1:37:58] if i'm being attacked by the demons of
[1:38:01] hell
[1:38:02] it shows me whose side i'm on
[1:38:08] they can rob my health they can rob my
[1:38:10] strength but they can never take that
[1:38:12] which was deposited before the
[1:38:14] foundation of the world
[1:38:16] i have to tell you satan god got the got
[1:38:18] to me
[1:38:19] before you ever got to me
[1:38:21] [Applause]
[1:38:25] before sin could get me god got me
[1:38:28] before the devil got me predestination
[1:38:30] got me
[1:38:31] hallelujah oh the blood will never lose
[1:38:36] its power
[1:38:42] well look at the attack brother andrew
[1:38:43] yeah look at it look at what the jury
[1:38:46] what the
[1:38:46] bride is going through look at what
[1:38:48] we're facing we've never faced
[1:38:50] anything like we're facing look at the
[1:38:52] ministry
[1:38:54] look at the ministry that ought to show
[1:38:56] you what side is right
[1:38:58] but still people want to hold on hold on
[1:39:03] hold on to the world it's so great
[1:39:06] i just gotta go back let me tell you
[1:39:08] ain't nothing out there
[1:39:10] we're going back to i've done been a
[1:39:12] part of all kinds of things out there
[1:39:14] and there's not one thing out there that
[1:39:18] i would give up
[1:39:20] there's not one thing out there that i
[1:39:22] would give up this eternal life for
[1:39:26] i know where a bottle leads you i know
[1:39:28] where women lead you
[1:39:30] i know where drugs lead you but i know
[1:39:32] where the holy ghost leads me
[1:39:34] it'll lead me to higher planes it'll
[1:39:36] lead me to deliverance
[1:39:37] it'll lead me to my children getting
[1:39:39] filled with the baptism of the holy
[1:39:41] ghost
[1:39:41] it'll lead me to healing it'll lead me
[1:39:43] to miracles
[1:39:44] it'll lead me to an overcoming church
[1:39:49] mourning is coming
[1:40:00] hallelujah
[1:40:05] you look at some people and they go into
[1:40:08] a battle
[1:40:09] man they get wrecked up
[1:40:13] but there's some people i know that go
[1:40:15] into a battle
[1:40:17] and that's when they really show their
[1:40:18] colors
[1:40:21] they were built for a battle what is it
[1:40:25] they've got a whole armor on
[1:40:27] and it seems like that there's some
[1:40:29] people i'm very acquainted with
[1:40:31] that when the battle gets hot and the
[1:40:34] battle gets rough
[1:40:35] they get better
[1:40:39] there's some people to take them back
[1:40:41] take a hit in the mouth and man
[1:40:43] it'll knock him out cold but then some
[1:40:44] people can take a knocking and they just
[1:40:46] keep on rocking
[1:40:49] as it's a people i'm acquainted with and
[1:40:51] i'd say i dared say she's the bride of
[1:40:53] jesus christ
[1:40:55] that it seems like when the battle gets
[1:40:57] so hot and so rough
[1:40:59] that it really shows out who she really
[1:41:01] is it shows out you know there's some
[1:41:04] people
[1:41:04] that don't know how to fight and there's
[1:41:08] some people that look
[1:41:10] it just looks like the battle's looking
[1:41:12] for him and there's some people
[1:41:15] that when they are in the midst of a
[1:41:17] fight man do they shine
[1:41:20] man they pull out moves the jackie chan
[1:41:23] didn't know nothing about
[1:41:24] they pulled out moves that had to come
[1:41:27] from a headship
[1:41:29] you see there are people that when the
[1:41:31] battle and when the fight gets worse
[1:41:33] they get better you look at the children
[1:41:36] of god and every time you look at the
[1:41:38] battles throughout the old testament
[1:41:39] you look at them unless sin was in the
[1:41:42] camp then they would get in trouble
[1:41:44] but you look at the people of god and
[1:41:46] when they would get in the midst of a
[1:41:47] fight
[1:41:48] then they got better they didn't grow
[1:41:50] weaker they grew stronger
[1:41:52] and you look out upon people like today
[1:41:55] let's just call one let's call
[1:41:56] jonathan dameron that when the fight
[1:41:58] gets hot and when the fight gets rough
[1:42:01] he gets better at it let me call one
[1:42:03] you're all acquainted with when you look
[1:42:05] at ron spencer and when the battle gets
[1:42:07] rough
[1:42:08] it looks like ron spencer says hold up a
[1:42:10] minute you to mess with the wrong child
[1:42:13] now
[1:42:13] [Applause]
[1:42:21] to me when you're all alone and when
[1:42:24] you're in the fight is when you truly
[1:42:26] show your colors and where you are your
[1:42:27] best
[1:42:28] now to me to me jesus was good when he
[1:42:32] healed the widow name son
[1:42:33] to me jesus was good when he walked down
[1:42:36] to lazarus
[1:42:37] and he raised him from the dead he was
[1:42:40] good when he walked down to jerius's
[1:42:42] house
[1:42:42] and he raised up a dead lady he was good
[1:42:45] when he healed the lepers but to me when
[1:42:47] jesus was at his best
[1:42:49] when he walked into the garden of
[1:42:50] gethsemane and he said not my will
[1:42:53] but thy will be done and he climbed up
[1:42:55] calvary's hill
[1:42:56] i'd say that's when jesus was at his
[1:42:59] best
[1:43:00] i'd say that there's a people that will
[1:43:02] overcome laodicea
[1:43:04] and they will do it at their best
[1:43:10] let's stand
[1:43:22] hallelujah
[1:43:26] all the disciples were shook up
[1:43:31] because they had lost
[1:43:34] the messiah
[1:43:38] they'd seen him do the work that only
[1:43:41] the messiah could do
[1:43:43] they seen him
[1:43:47] when he was hanging on a cross they seen
[1:43:51] him as he climbed that mountain
[1:43:53] they seen him as he died
[1:43:56] they seen him as they put him in a grave
[1:44:01] but jesus knew that morning was coming
[1:44:08] i will tell you you can put us in a
[1:44:11] lion's den
[1:44:15] and we'll see you in the morning
[1:44:18] i want to tell you you could put us into
[1:44:21] a valley
[1:44:22] where we're outnumbered and we'll come
[1:44:25] out
[1:44:27] i want to tell you you can put our
[1:44:29] leader in a grave
[1:44:31] you can kill him you can wrap him you
[1:44:34] can put spices on him
[1:44:35] but morning's coming you can cry all you
[1:44:39] want to
[1:44:40] but morning is coming
[1:44:43] god ain't looking for some backwards
[1:44:46] some backwards christian he's looking
[1:44:48] for somebody
[1:44:49] that's full of power and courage
[1:44:53] he's looking for somebody that's not
[1:44:55] willing to knock down to what the
[1:44:57] devil's got to say
[1:45:01] so you can throw me into a lion's den
[1:45:03] and you can put torment all around me
[1:45:06] but i know morning is coming
[1:45:10] the disciples were put in a cave
[1:45:14] for 10 days and they were scared
[1:45:17] they were cowards they was hiding from
[1:45:20] the public
[1:45:23] brother branham said that when that
[1:45:26] quickening power came
[1:45:28] there was a bravery that come on the
[1:45:29] inside of them
[1:45:31] like the line of a tribe of judah that
[1:45:33] was on the inside of them
[1:45:34] and they busted out they busted out
[1:45:39] so it shows me that you can try to lock
[1:45:41] us up you can try to scare us
[1:45:43] into the darkness but when the
[1:45:45] quickening power comes
[1:45:47] we're busting out
[1:45:53] i don't got 52 sermons tonight
[1:45:56] busting out may be my next sermon
[1:46:00] oh hallelujah you can put us in a jail
[1:46:03] but we're busting the house
[1:46:05] house of hell give way in the name of
[1:46:07] jesus
[1:46:08] hallelujah you can go through darkness
[1:46:13] but morning is coming
[1:46:19] around hallelujah
[1:46:23] you got one one more minute

[1:47:09] darkness just before day we know that
[1:47:11] the morning star is hanging yonder
[1:47:14] to introduce the coming sun it's that
[1:47:17] when the morning star
[1:47:18] shines it's going between it's always
[1:47:21] darkest
[1:47:22] just a few minutes before the day the
[1:47:25] blackout comes the moon fails to shine
[1:47:27] the darkest before day
[1:47:29] is because the light is pressing the
[1:47:30] darkness but the morning star comes out
[1:47:33] and says

[1:48:44] and it begins to move up and forth on
[1:48:46] blades of grass by the gym

[1:48:52] that dew

[1:59:06] name
[1:59:07] for there's no one like our god
[1:59:11] there's no one that could promise us
[1:59:14] that when we get in the midst
[1:59:18] of a chaotic problem
[1:59:23] that they'll be there but you father
[1:59:27] we can lose sight of our friends and
[1:59:28] lose sight of our loved ones
[1:59:31] but you're always there
[1:59:34] lord i pray that we would fix our eyes
[1:59:39] upon the sun that has risen in this
[1:59:44] evening
[1:59:44] hour lord jesus
[1:59:48] you have lifted us above
[1:59:51] all of this busyness of life and the
[1:59:54] chaos of laodicea
[1:59:56] may we not fix our eyes
[2:00:01] on the problems around us but may we fix
[2:00:04] our eyes on the one that could fix all
[2:00:07] the problems
[2:00:09] god there's going to be some things that
[2:00:11] we can't handle
[2:00:13] but when we can't handle it may we
[2:00:16] freely give them to a god that can't
[2:00:18] handle it
[2:00:20] our scars that we so easily want to
[2:00:23] cover and pull down the sleeve as it
[2:00:26] were
[2:00:28] god you've seen them before we ever
[2:00:30] begin to
[2:00:31] get in a bruising situation
[2:00:34] where the enemy would abuse us and
[2:00:36] afflict us father
[2:00:40] god you have called us unto a
[2:00:41] perfectness
[2:00:43] a purity in holiness that we would not
[2:00:47] be scarred up by the things of the world
[2:00:50] but we would stand before you blameless
[2:00:52] without blemish
[2:00:54] holy and pure justified in your sight as
[2:00:57] if we've never done it
[2:00:59] father may we
[2:01:04] forgive ourselves
[2:01:08] may we forgive one another
[2:01:12] may we forgive
[2:01:16] our past
[2:01:20] lord jesus i don't know why
[2:01:23] you want me to say those things
[2:01:27] but father
[2:01:31] may they know that there is power in the
[2:01:33] blood
[2:01:34] to forgive themselves and forgive
[2:01:38] all of their evil acts and doings
[2:01:42] and if you have forgiven us
[2:01:45] we should look on ourselves as forgiven
[2:01:51] father we may look at ourselves and see
[2:01:55] ourselves as
[2:01:56] unworthy
[2:01:59] not qualified not good enough but may we
[2:02:04] turn our eyes
[2:02:07] to the fixing point of thy word that is
[2:02:10] said
[2:02:11] that you have made us worthy
[2:02:15] we stand in this moment
[2:02:19] as the redeemed bride of jesus christ
[2:02:24] and what the enemy has charged against
[2:02:27] us
[2:02:29] we throw those charges against him
[2:02:33] father your word says forgiven
[2:02:37] so we speak forgiven your word says
[2:02:40] grace
[2:02:41] we say grace your word has told us that
[2:02:45] your blood is perfect
[2:02:47] so we will believe in a perfect blood
[2:02:52] lord jesus
[2:02:57] your word says we can be healed
[2:03:01] so we're going to believe that we can be
[2:03:03] healed
[2:03:05] your word says that you have miracle
[2:03:08] working power and you change not
[2:03:12] so we will stay with what the word says
[2:03:16] father when we don't feel like saying it
[2:03:19] may we still continue to say it
[2:03:22] i hear a prophet telling us say it to
[2:03:25] your believer
[2:03:27] say it to your believer father
[2:03:31] lord jesus may we walk out of this place
[2:03:36] saying what your word says and not
[2:03:38] saying what we feel nor in our emotions
[2:03:42] but what you have deposited god we love
[2:03:45] you tonight
[2:03:47] we express our gratitude to you

[2:04:18] you can believe it or not but you're

[2:04:23] when abraham lincoln signed it when he
[2:04:26] signed the declaration
[2:04:29] every one of them was free
[2:04:33] there's a lot of people that don't want
[2:04:35] to talk about that today and they want
[2:04:38] to forget their history but they're
[2:04:39] forgetting their freedom
[2:04:42] and if you begin to forget your freedom

[2:04:46] you up
[2:04:49] i don't know about you but i can never
[2:04:51] forget the freedom of christ
[2:04:53] and i can never forget what he got me
[2:04:55] out of

[2:04:59] and turn down everything else

[2:05:04] he freed you from the pit of hell
[2:05:08] those slaves knew that morning was
[2:05:10] coming

[2:05:15] the way up that hill
[2:05:17] and they were waiting for this under
[2:05:18] rise they waited up
[2:05:21] all night long because they knew morning

[2:05:37] worship
[2:05:39] i don't know what it's about but
[2:05:40] tonight's about your freedom

[2:06:30] in the name of the world
[2:06:32] full of uncertainties
[2:06:37] when the plans that are made
[2:06:40] fall apart
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:57] there is a promise
