declaration satan's defeated [Applause] and we leaving [Applause] thank you for being here this weekend thank you for being a part of all of this thank you for all of that we we know god god's moving andrew was going to speak last this morning because i had told him that i just didn't feel up to to speak in two services in a row but god had different plans i had a special visitation last night during the night and so from that i want to speak to you this morning and and i believe the lord has got some very special things and i will try not to hold you too long but as i spoke last night on driven to fulfill i want to continue that thought pattern this is not a what-if this is not a maybe it's going to happen this is not a calculation of some man's putting things together this is the vision of god's mind happening before your very eyes i want to share some very intimate things with you this morning as we would go forward i feel a liberty and so from that i just ask you that you would help me and help me help me preach if you will first john chapter 1 and verse 1. god bless you brother joe and sister rexan our friends of life and we're so glad to we'll be neighbors one of these days and so amen amen i know you're enjoying the fulfillment of the word i know you're enjoying that grandbaby amen it's really nice of you to share this morning with sister charlene amen the light is so bright over there it's just unbelievable so amen god bless you god bless each and every one of you for being here if i do not get the chance to shake your hand i pray that you understand some things that that we are we're involved in and so you continue to pray for us and we're believing for 100 total healing amen we believe that amen amen first john chapter 1 and verse 1 and he's saying this very passionate sacred from his heart that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with our with the father and with his son jesus christ these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message that we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen you may be seated in luke chapter 9 that will hovel up on the screen but in luke chapter 9 and verse 23 this is a this is when jesus is standing literally in two worlds speaking to his disciples and i hope you understand it the man and the eternal part amen and he said to them if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me and whosoever will shall save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantaged if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he had come into his own glory and in his father's and of the holy angels now notice this next verse and i want you to just hang on to it and i'd like for you to read it several times this week would that be okay but i tell you of a truth that there be some standing here and i don't want you to think two thousand years ago which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god and they did and we will will you read that scripture again with me and i want you to say before we read it this is for me but i tell you the truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god philippians chapter 3 and verse 13 brethren i count not myself to be apprehended but this one thing that i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus brother branham is given a quote and i want to share a couple with you before we go forward he said as it was in them days he said so will it be the message went forth and they merely laughed at it mocked at it as someone who was telling some kind of an idol tale but it was of mercy and it was a grace and it was of deliverance oh my he said and the angel said that morning to lot after he'd give that message he said hasten come hither for i can do nothing till thou has come hither i want you to notice now this this now because we have to cut short here on the account of a prayer line did you notice that the angel said i can do nothing till you come hither what was it it was the message of deliverance and before one of the fire could fall from heaven lot had to get out of sodom he said and before one drop of rain fell from heaven noah went into the ark and before the atom bomb can strike this nation the church will go in a rapture to meet the lord jesus and if sputniks and missiles are said and hammers are pulled back and the angels of god are all standing in order hallelujah the great quarters of heaven is crowded full the hearts are all in tune the great bands are already practiced up there's a home time coming pretty soon he says a homecoming time coming pretty soon for the church of the living god who's been waiting for his coming everything's in order i'm so glad i'm tell i'm getting so tired oh for that great hour and to think that we've had a part in this junction of time remember so shall it be in the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed from heaven now remember before the rain fell noah was in the ark before fire fell lot was out of sodom the angel said i can do nothing until it you come hither he said i've got the lever in my hand to pull and make the fires fall from heaven and i think that's exactly the angel of destruction is holding the hand of russia with atomic bombs until the church comes together as one great body of christ i can do nothing until you come hither or if that isn't a blessed assurance and if we can see everything set in order i don't want this just to be another quote you're a part of this it could not happen until you were ready you thought you were just moving from mississippi you thought you were moving from west virginia you thought you were doing this you thought you were doing that everything had to be in exactly the right order hats got to be in the right place before it can happen no man listen let me just say this is not being orchestrated by some feeble man i want to be very much assured you this is not being orchestrated by some politics [Applause] listen brother branham wasn't even in charge of this he was the messenger of the age that was entrusted a man that could not even save his own self it took the blood of jesus christ a redeemed man to speak the word of life and we are redeemed people that can come to our place of order another quote the church has not recognized her day like israel back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there it's quite a step isn't it brother brandon was saying as a prophet looking at israel back in her homeland she don't even know how she got back there how many times have we heard people that were extremely rich left their homes left their businesses left everything with the clothes on their back and moved back to israel because they were driven they were driven to go home that's where we're at you united states is a wonderful place your country's wherever you're listening to this message is a wonderful place but this isn't home we're being driven we're magnetized to the word of life [Applause] what left others they wasn't magnetized to it jesus would say blessed are your eyes for you see blessed are your ears you couldn't make yourself see this [Music] she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there national forest notice these words national force put her in her place and he said i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force notice these next words by the prophet national force will put the church in the world council of churches the umbilical cord that holds them all together is the baptism the greatest lie that was ever told that denies the deity of jesus christ that jesus was god or he was the greatest deceiver that ever lived but jesus was god and the lie was father son holy ghost baptism [Music] but the power of god that's what we're witnessing now the power of god will put the people in the bride then who gathered you who gathered you who put you here wherever you are listening who put you in your church who put you there what drives you there not the personality of a man we're not building kingdoms here worshiping it god's not going to send another messenger listen if this message didn't awaken you to prepare you for the rapture there's not another rapture coming there's not another messenger coming the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god which is the word my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place and she'll recognize her position in the word and she'll be in christ will put her in her place no national force will do that he said but the national force did drive israel to her homeland the national force puts the church of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory i wanted to say this to you we are the final we're the final runners never let this statement just ease across your ears you're the final voice to the final age you may not be a preacher but you're preaching a life you're a signature addition of what this bible and this message is you're sealed by the token the the conductor himself checked your your your luggage he checked your life everything was in order hallelujah you went through the sanctification process you went through the justification process and he sealed you with the holy ghost his own life we i just want to share a couple things with you before i go far the scripture said that these signs shall follow them that believe we're not imitators of brother branham neither and that was not a gift that was christ himself don't don't confuse what brother branham had as some pentecostal gift he was not reading minds he was not telepathy when he was standing there with that blind man and he turned and said which of your gods can come heal this man when he was standing there over that little boy in finland he said if he smiled off of the ground in five minutes call me a false prophet you better know where you stand when he would step out behind the audience said if i'm not telling the truth may god strike me dead and then in the next few minutes call out 14 different people and tell them more than five incidents of peace and was absolutely right we're not fooling with some pentecostal nonsense when i said that nonsense i'm talking about impersonators i caught that now just like you we all have a testimony brother biscuit was i'm just going to share a couple things here to kind of set the stage brother biscuit was wrote by a sister in switzerland and you've heard it you've heard it for decade that she was a wounded one stood in your pulpit and told this story stood here i actually accompanied by the david mayer incidentally i'll share that in a moment brother bischo felt led to ask me to be a part of those meetings i felt greatly honored because i believe in the supernatural and that this sister which i know very well wrote him she was driven to see revival she was driven to see this message lived in her country meetings evolved and i'm not going to take a long time because history tells it meetings evolved and year after year that meeting grew and people came from country after country one cut one particular meeting was 19 different countries came to that meeting and i went there about 10 times it's not an easy trip it's not a vacation one morning after being severely sick for about 36 hours i would think maybe just a little less than that extremely sick i actually thought i was going to die and i'm not i'm not making that up brother glenn gruener came to my rescue god touch my body and i went back to sleep and when i woke up a couple hours later it's i i was as strong in that moment as i am right now i knew it was supernatural and i walked to the pulpit that morning and i spoke a sermon called what will you be remembered for sister cassie actually wrote a wrote a song about that in that meeting brother biscuit was sitting there and he recognized i want you to understand now he recognized the atmosphere not the man but he recognized the atmosphere was the same that he said had in the 60s and he said i have a need and he had worked on a project for for over a decade with lawyers and and many high-powered men to try to help it get taken care of and after the meeting was over with he said i have a need and i want brother ron to pray for me and i prayed for a man on the left of the and then i left because i was very weary and i walked down and joshua von de brunt was standing there you've heard me tell this story before joshua von der brock was standing there brother guido's son and i and i turned to him and i said you'll preach the gospel and you'll need the holy ghost to go with it and he fell to the ground and he turned and brother biscuit was there and he prayed with brother bischo and as i prayed with brother biscuit his wife and daughter as i prayed with him i didn't know the deed he didn't share it with me and didn't need to share it with me and as i prayed the words flowed out of my mouth they gave him direction 90 days later it was done what men couldn't do what himself couldn't do that atmosphere that same lord jesus that's in the building right now don't you make light of this right now don't make light of it boys are a witness brother biscuit called me a few years ago and he said brother ronnie i'm only calling you i'm sitting on the table right now and they're wanting to do heart surgery open heart surgery i'm no better than anybody else but he felt to call me matthew was you was you driving the truck i think you were i think you were driving a truck i'm just gonna empty my heart today matthew was driving the truck we were sitting in the truck we had just left near harbor freight we had just left that area in harrisonburg and we're turning the corner i didn't tell brother biscuit that i was in a truck he just asked me to pray and i was aware that this is the same man that said in the car when they were talking about could this be elijah and in that instance the angel came into the car stay with me now the angel came into the car and pushed brother briscoe whom i'm now praying for his head and he turned and he said i looked out the corner of my eye and brother biscuit brother branham's face was ash and white and his beard was standing out and i realized who i'm praying for there's some moments between life and death when you're talking about open heart surgery on an 80 couple year old man you're talking about this is between life and death and as the prayer went god anoint a young doctor to step in at the last moment to take the case brother biscuit had been been dealing with a set of doctors and in the last moment a young doctor walked in and took the case and said i'll be taking the case and he remembered what the words were in the prayer and it was a complete different kind of procedure don't tell me god's not among us here's what i'm trying to drive down to us now don't sit on your pew and think this is just another church or just another bride around the world where we built churches we drove down stakes we preached the message of the hour god didn't do this just to see if he could build a church he's building a bride and she's born of his bone she's life of his life she's power of his power it would be in that country that a man like francois leprecha has been driven to speak to translate the message to the french people for all of these years would see renewed revival and i'm speaking this i hope it gets to him and a man named david mayer would rise from the ashes now as a church now has a beautiful congregation now speaks in brother biscuit's meeting brother tom's meeting over the last few years the morning service and i say doing a phenomenal job not because he was a talented man because god had elected him and anointed him and there was a time and season to raise him up [Applause] are you with me this is more than ed bischo's vision this is more than our vision this church is more than homer fraser vision it's god's vision [Applause] i found it interesting that brother david mayer sent me pictures of baptizing his last daughter joanna this morning this morning all three of his children baptized i want to be very attentive now we are here to advance we're not here to go back our worship is not taking us back to azusa street pentecost that was under the man age it is not to create a rally it's not to ride on our emotions but it is what the word has produced and brother ram said anything that without life it's dead and it needs to be buried brother branham said in in the invisible union of the bride he said the modern church don't want any of this whooping and screaming and crying they'd get real nervous in our services even now whooping screaming and speaking in tongues but he said that's the only kind that the word can produce [Applause] now this is more than an evolving with man it wasn't much too long ago that the highest horsepower was was horses you haven't got it that's where that term come from and men bred horses the fastest the strongest to do work with them to foreforeign work and of course they raised them because that's always in man it's competition and so it went from horses to a guy that was driven to have an idea that you could have horsepower in an engine i know i'm skipping a lot of steps but i i don't i don't have long to speak to you so one engine after another now you could have stayed with that horse but coming by you were men in race cars now i don't want you to miss this now but in but in martin luther's day they were driven that me and you could have a bible they were driven that the church could have a bible of their own we were driven that there would be bibles in in china listen murphy wong was driven that there would be bibles in china don't worry god's got a bride there and the communistic party will not shut them down you can arrest them you can do what you want to but you can't you can't stop the seed of god [Applause] now the next messenger would come many would stay with the old message many would stay with the old message because it felt sure it's mamas it was mama's church it was daddy's church how could they be wrong but the light went further and the just shall live by faith you don't have to pray to a bishop you don't have to pray for a pope you don't have to count rosary beads the just shall live by faith but there came a day where that word became obsolete and men denominated it and then along came wesley and wesley left his co-formal lutheran church and moved out and preached in streets and in fields and wherever he could preach and they called it the new method and people would fall out of the holy ghost literally thousands at a time would fall out under that anointing i wish this could get to jeffersonville tonight i wish this would go to them but it wasn't just wesley preaching the message but men were anointed around the world to grab that new light and preach it men like peter cartwright and they were driven they spent their their energies they spent their life they were driven to preach this new word [Applause] this message came and there's a fifo ministry and no jeffersonville will never shut us down it is not our headquarters [Applause] and i'm going to say it very strongly they're only living on the light of decades ago we are the final voice and let me just echo this i believe in listening to james i believe that atmosphere ought to be in your homes but you need a god call pastor to keep the church clean [Applause] a man he doesn't have to be able to do nothing to preach his way out of a paper bag that doesn't matter but a holy ghost-filled man that believes the message and he's driven [Applause] he's driven not to reproduce himself but to preach the word of christ and this message is christ and if you get in it it'll produce jesus christ the reason some of you are not rejoicing is because you ain't been in it in a long time you're only occupying a pew you're only taking up space and if you're not careful you're going to miss it amen and i'm saying these things because i feel the very freedom of the very angel of the lord you see last night i'm just going to go ahead and tell you this last night when i started saying some of these things and even about the vaccine if that made you mad you need the holy ghost [Applause] the holy ghost is the inoculation to keep you from sin you need that vaccine and if you don't have the holy ghost it's a sure thing you're going in the tribulation period so you above all people need to pay attention to these services to prepare you to give you strength to get you through the tribulation period don't miss a service i'm going to be longer in an hour i apologize ahead of time but i'm paying for your ice cream i've already paid for your ham sandwiches i'm going to pay for your ice cream you're going to get after church so we might as well have church [Applause] i'm sorry i made that announcement early but i had to get some of them back on board with me brother branham would have a vision of a bride and they first of all there was a vision of this this bride as it came into view and it was worldly it was that modern church and it came up and he saw it i don't want you to do it but these modern televangelists when they scan the audience i'm not being judgmental they are being judgmental when brother brandon says not one bobbed heard woman in heaven and they've got crossdressers sitting all across their audience you thought i was talking about a man but there they said in their pants the women sit in their pants and run the church the church is run by a bunch of cross dressers if you ain't got it straightened out yet put it on youtube if you want to it'll be all right it's the truth anyway [Applause] brother branham was ashamed he said is this what my message produced oh yeah he was ashamed he felt like i haven't done the job he was just so defeated and the angel reminded him here come the bride now when brother branham was even here in harrisonburg just like he was all over the world seven times the mouse that he traveled is why they say it seven times but brother branham preached the same message in africa as he did here now this reason that is is the same holy ghost that's in elkton virginia is the same holy ghost that is in johnson city or in in arkansas it's the same holy ghost it doesn't it's not cultural it's not cultural it's not european it's not it's not german it's not black and white it's the same life that was in jesus christ and if you remember he said that we would do the greater works i'm okay i just failed that we would do the greater works satan knows brother nathanael when he looks in our eyes it's the same life that he looked in jesus's eyes [Applause] satan knows it's the same life when he looks in your eyes in your vassal it's not you living it no more it's him living i need i need a tissue or something thank you reason i shared that with you about brother bisical is now i want to share something across the airwaves to a very dear buddy of mine as i was reminded last night at about 3 30 about a vision that i had when i stood we were standing in a very dark place and people were mingling in the darkness and and i was standing on one side of the gate and tim pruitt was standing on the other side of the gate and we were doing our absolute best to get them into the light and it was the greatest light i'd ever seen it was like ropes coming out of it was like beams of light that was coming out of the gates and it was like angels music that was coming out of it it was beams and we were working we were driven brother tim has just lost that which is most precious to him is his wife she's now standing in another room with esther's baby with other babies that she didn't get to know in this life but she got to know them the moment she stepped across [Applause] i've got two sisters there i'll meet one of these days god has ordained a doctor to be able to perform surgery on you brother tim because you've got a lot of work to do and i'm reminded by that vision he said brother on you're talking personal now absolutely i'm reminded by that vision that you will continue to work in this dark age and you will be driven driven beyond humanity you'll be driven we got a lot of work to do hallelujah we've been praying for a visitation and it came last night and i stand there order to the lord to say this very clearly we've got a lot of work to do brother tim [Applause] michael dexter stood here and i'm going to need your help here just now he stood here just only months ago a couple months ago and he told you that he was going to sing the great physician now is here now whether you know this or not sister cassie has a double major in theory and composition she don't want me telling that but she does a piano she could have sold that gift to the world and i'm going to say this very clearly she could have walked out when a lot of the others walked out so if you want a hero and she begins to play that song while he continues michael is a very is a very anointed very sensitive to the spirit of god he's in tune i could tell a few more stories here but i'm not for time's sake he's in tune and instead of singing the great physician now is here and she's already started that she begins to sing he begins to sing when jesus comes he's making an announcement he don't know it when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken cassie's continue she's thinking well this is a he's making up a verse she continues and after a bit she catches on i'm sitting here and i know i know michael's gift listen we're doing more in heaven church here and michael is singing when jesus comes so he's making an announcement that this room is getting ready to be filled with the presence of jesus his brother-in-law and they had not previously arranged to be here at the same time his brother-in-law timothy pruitt is preaching and he's coming down to the end and he steps out here and he begins to talk about the fourth man in the fire and could you imagine and his ipad i was sitting there watching i watched the ipad flip and change what's the term go from one one act to another i just know how to thumb through these things and i watch it change i turned to andrew and i said the angel of the lord is standing at the pulpit and brother branham's voice begins to come on and he's talking about the song being written down from his glory no man did that no man brought you here no man produced this message no man did that you're right i'd like to mention a few few driven men had biscuit driven to get this message out driven not to have a kingdom of his own driven not to call not to have men lift him up driven and would become upset if you would lift him donny reagan driven let me just say this to you and i say it around the world there's not a denomination in the world has produced preachers not a school of theology has produced men that could carry donnie reagan's lunch box [Applause] last night when i i defended when i defended the fifo ministry a demon raised up from right here and began to raise and it raised and it raised i don't care if you believe it or not it raised and it was taller than me and i turned and started preaching to it and i preached to the devil and i stood here and i preached to the devil and after about five minutes it disintegrated like a bomb went off that is why [Applause] tim brooke could have said a crippled boy all of his life but he was driven he was driven to be able to stand on his feet and preach the gospel and go around the world and preach the gospel from a hole in the world place when he built this and he didn't have to go to get a loan god provided for every dime because god wanted that building to be set in there that's why satan hates this ministry that's why i have a 60th birthday present that my family got for me and it was my mother's bible that she gave me in 1984 and i've used it through the years nathaniel it's nathaniel in the building nathan nathaniel you're nathaniel i carry his picture in this bible as a boy and it was so wore out but my family had it rebound for me that i could carry it so i could carry the way of a true prophet and on the back of it the lord said if you trust me i'll use you like never before it won't be much longer brother joe sits here today because of his father was driven it didn't take him 42 times to hear brother branham but when brother branham walked on the pulpit and he saw brother branham he said all i could do was weep he was consumed with the humbleness of elijah and from that point he was driven that there be churches around the world and i've heard you use the term of over 600 churches built through your camp meeting through which we've been a part of throughout these years you live in a very nice home but god's got a mansion waiting dan daisly kerry division and you have picked up the torch when other critics want to criticize you picked up the torch come on now i want to say this you in the name of the lord he's not done yet there's a lot of work for you to do joe green he's not done yet oh satan's been whispering in your ear that you're a failure your humanity is not enough you're intimidated by your own humanity but he's a liar in the name of jesus christ he's a liar he's a father of lies it's god or jane jew it's god elected you it is god that anointed you now what you need is what he got in victoria and the same god is in the building as what was in this on the street once you lay your hands on him right now receive ye the holy ghost like never before in your life [Music] [Music] i'm looking to see linda kreger you're in
