seated this time it's at this time I'd like to read a letter to the church brother Andrew has read this last weekend and we have sent this out through text messages and we just want to make sure that everyone has received this and has heard this and will be able to read this there we go it took me a minute to find it there this is the Full Gospel lighthouse letter to the church this is the phase one letter if you know somebody that hasn't been streaming in that comes to service here we ask you that you'll just make them aware of these dates and how that services will go or if somebody does not receive text messages that you give give this to them or that don't read text messages make them aware of it brother Andrew read it last weekend some people got it some people didn't so now I'm reading it so wake up amen says dear dear Full Gospel lighthouse Tyburn aqua Church family we have certainly missed being able to assemble ourselves together according to the Bible has taught us to do so in Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the Assemblies of ourselves together as the manner as some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see that Day approaching although we've been very grateful for the opportunity to greet you and bring forth preaching of the word via livestream truly it has been a blessing of the Lord from many local and around the world and even those who are not believers have been tuning in and want to thank each and every one of you who has been as of now the government is introducing a phase one of reopening the state and easing restrictions for gatherings and asking for 50 percent capacity of the gatherings at churches again we do not believe that this is a religious persecution that necessitates the need to divide defy our government's requests as they are trying to contain the virus we want to do our part to make sure we don't increase the spread of this virus and our congregation nor hurt our assembly in any way health-wise nor affect anyone's employment brother Ron and brother Andrew have come up with some guidelines for us to try and resume services in a safe manner these guidelines may seem difficult and different we were looking for a safe way for us to attend services in person we're trusting this is only for a short time until we can once again resume a sense of Norma C and our services the following recommendations and guidelines that we would like to asked for our teamwork in trying to abide with social distancing and at some time give us a chance to attend at least one service a week in person first of all we would like to ask if you asked you not to come to church if you or anyone in your family are sick or having symptoms of coughing runny nose fever or sore throat we ask there be no shaking of hands nor hugging anyone during this time repeat we ask there be no shaking hands or hugging anyone at this time as Paul says salute thy brethren when you arrive at church we will have outside we will have the outside of the sanctuary doors propped open so no one has to open or close them the deacons or Usher's will seat you in the sanctuary in order to maintain social distancing six feet apart you will be seated with your entire family you may not be able to sit in your normal location in the sanctuary any of your belongings that you have left at the church such as blankets bags toys etc will be moved to the back near the tape library for you to grab and take with you once you leave service the local and state authorities have recommended that we wear face masks or coverings while gathering we would like you to we would like to ask everyone that has their own face covering to wear it when coming to services if you do not have a face covering we will provide one with for you before entering the church please wear the face mask until you are seated in the sanctuary the decision to leave your face covering on and the sanctuary during service would be left up to each individual at their own discretion we will have multiple hand sanitizing stations set up as always please wash your hands repeat wash your hands I might need to say that one again wash your hands I like some of the guidelines that's been set up that people are starting to do wear glove washing their hands I'd like to see the ratio of flu illnesses compared to kovat now after people's washing their hands with trying to maintain social dis dude to the size of the congregation we can only accommodate a certain amount of people in the sanctuary therefore we would like half of our congregation to attend on Saturday night at 7:00 and the other half Sunday morning at 11:10 of Li the plan to start these in-person services is Saturday May the 23rd and Sunday May the 24th on Saturday nights we would like those who normally sit on the right side brother Joe and brother Vernon side for Saturday night and on Sunday mornings those who normally sit on the left side as you enter the sanctuary to attend on Sunday mornings the side brother Shannon and brother Alden sit on this will give us adequate space for everyone to sit six feet from the congregants also the musicians and sound technicians and their families can attend both services if they feel comfortable enough to do so it would be greatly appreciated we are asking there to be no congregation and the vestibule bathrooms or nurseries nurseries are going to be held for nursing babies only and those that need diaper changes nursing baby only and those that need diaper changes the front porch or the parking lot we ask that there be no congregating in the vestibules nurseries front porch or parking lot before or after services after service is over that deacons uh sure 'z will dismiss the congregation by rows back to front to allow everyone to dismiss to their cars even on the outside of church we ask there be no kind of congregating we asked there be no shaking of hands nor hugging anyone during this time as Paul said salute thy brethren we will receive tithes and offerings by letting each row come forward one at a time and place them in the offering plates at the altar we will not have Sunday excuse me we will not have Saturday kids choir nor adult or a young adult choir until further notice our though we although we are opening our church services in this manner if for some reason you do not feel safe nor comfortable to return at this time we totally understand the decision will be left up to you as an individual at your own discretion the services will continue to be streamed via Church website and YouTube channel finally we want to encourage you all to remember our brothers and sisters in Christ during this season what a great time for us as a bride of Jesus to bind our hearts together in Christian love and faith and lift up the needs that are facing that we are facing as a church and a nation and we believe this we believe that God is with us and we will see miracles this year amen so if you would like to read over that again it was sent via text message and this will be posted on the church website as well we thank each and every one of you for abiding by the guidelines that we have set forth and we ask you that you will just respect them and we hope to see you here in church 23rd and 24th and we will have great services any man we're believing in that a man a man maybe we

I'll tell you what that'll make you feel like running this morning running the last mile home a man what a what a wonderful thought this morning that we're longing for home and to know that we're we're nearing the gate nearing the door as it were and we just we just know that it's the bride's time and so it's it's time for us to to take a rapture and we're certainly looking forward forward to the coming of the Lord and we know that he is appearing to us in so many ways and speaking to us through his word thank the Lord for this word of this hour this message that has come by our way and ministered to our hearts and blessed us abundantly you know we feel so insufficient sometimes but His grace has placed us it's nothing on our own merits or nothing we've done but only His grace and mercy we bring you good news this morning we we know that some of you have already heard this but to be able to approach you in this way to be able to make the news brother on we told you last weekend brother Ron had his scans on on Monday of the torso area and so it showed the lungs and every other organ and so we have good news there is no cancer in any other organ it's besides the brain and the the lungs and we're just thanking the Lord for those things because he is the one that is doing the work we know that brother on has taken chemo but God works through medicine and there are good signs of that of those things that are dissipating we were just praying that this thing is completely gone we are not just looking for one percent one percent gone but we're looking for 100 percent gone we are asking for his sugar has been every every whichaway this past week and so the doctors are working to do that and so you know they don't have a they don't have a perfect book they're practicing physicians so they're finding out what the Ron's body can handle and whatnot so we just pray that the doctors would be anointed not to just guess and and not that they have but not that they would guess or just make a presumption but maybe they'd be led of the Lord because they're working on God serving our pastor and so we want to continue to lift up brother on also this morning we met failed to make mention we want to be remembering brother Meadows and sister Irene as well and the needs they have in their body also we have an announcement this morning brother Nathaniel sister savanah he'll have a new addition to their family and also little Holden has an addition to his family yesterday morning Haven Esther Hill joined joined Full Gospel lighthouse choir and weighing in at 8 pounds in 1 ounces 20 and a half inches long so we congratulate them and their family and to the grandparents I know that their heads just blowing up and everything so we'll just congratulate the hill and the shifflett family and the Kelly family there so we're very thankful for them and so we're just we're just thankful for the Lord all that he has done for us and I cannot tell you how excited I am to be able to say that Lord willing next weekend we'll be having Church will be having church with our family and I know it may be a little bit different and the guidelines and things that we've said in order maybe just a little bit different but this is the way that we have to move forward and you might some might ask why we chose not to have service this weekend well it's instead of following a governor all the time I follow the leadership of the Lord and we just felt to do this way felt to be move on the side of precaution and so we we're just looking forward to the things of God and I tell you I'm having a jubilee in my heart just thinking about having you all here I missed you so much and and it's definitely a blessing and an honor to be able to greet you behind this pulpit in this manner but I can't wait to have you here we love each and every one of you with all of our hearts and has brother Matthew to read the letter again this morning I know just hearing and reading it you get it both ways so we just want to make you familiar with the things that we're setting in place and being an official of the state we have to do these things and and so we just want to move forward in the best way we can and we thank you for bearing with us and during these times I know that they are kind of unprecedented times and things are unusual but we'll get through this as a church as a people and so we've set guidelines and we've got different hand sanitizing stations for the singers as they as they come forward we ask that the special singers as we call on you to come forward and sing behind the piano like normal that way we can maintain far as cleaning cleaning purposes and whatnot and so we just will let you know before singing and if you can just hit up that hand sanitizer not that we're afraid of some virus or whatnot but we want to we want to use a we want to use precaution in these things and we want to we want to be smart about things and we know that just because we're people of faith does not make us immune to sickness and so we just want to be on the on the side of precaution also if you can arrive early I know this is some this is difficult on some with different job situations but if you can please arrive early to the Saturday night service we'll start the service at 7:00 but if you can arrive early in the early fashions so that the ushers and the deacons can seat you in proper order and adequate time and whatnot so we can have the space to set you out and things and we're not disrupting the service so if you can all arrive early that way these things can be done and just remember to bring your mask and your coverings and and those things and that be your choice whether you want to wear them during the service but we'll set you together as your family and then then we'll set you six feet apart and whatnot we have an adequate space here to be able to handle half of our congregation and one service hopefully we don't have to do this for long maybe maybe a week two weeks we don't know but we just want to move forward as we can and also want to take this time to welcome our community and our families to these church services that have been listening in that have been been a part of these services and maybe you have not attended Full Gospel lighthouse in person but we want to make you feel welcome here and maybe you're new here and you don't necessarily have a is a designate it side that you set on but you just come anyhow will will will make room for you and will take care of you and take care of everybody else but we want to thank you as a family for sharing the link and sharing these messages and and the community we keep hearing of new ones that are listening and you think that Satan's got a grip on things and he's winning but absolutely not God's in control and we know as we started this year that God is with us and we will see miracles and and to think about the barriers that are being broken down and this time this is this has been God and you know they say out of out of a crisis or out of time of despair that greatness is born and so this morning I don't know if it'd be greatness or not be called that but we have a little pandemic choir that we formed here this morning to be able to sing to you as the group will come this morning as we get ready to go over into the word will will sing to you and and we wanted to this to be a lot of blessing to you as a as a congregation and we're praying this is the last service that we have to gather in this fashion okay thank you also everything that has been in the pews your camping gear and whatnot is in the back already so we've moved that back there and so we're just we're just ready to have you back if you can pick up your Bibles and things as as you come and take them with you that way we can have room for setting the the community and our product goals as they return during this whole time as well and man god bless you this morning there's a happy land of promise or immigrations with st. immerses [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] we're looking forward to that day soon and very soon we're going to be with the king hey man hey man we praise His Holy Name today for all the good things that he's done done for us in this life man if you have your Bibles this morning we'll turn over to the book of Isaiah chapter 14 and verse 24 and then also down to Genesis chapter 24 and verse 1 Isaiah chapter 14 and 24 and then Genesis chapter 24 we'd like to speak to you again today by the help of the Lord and committed to the purpose committed to the purpose we don't know how much how long he'll lead us on these thoughts but we just want to just be mindful of the Lord and the leadership of the Lord and the inspiration of the Lord and we sense his nearness and and so we just want to be mindful of him be sensitive to his coming be sensitive to the moving of the Holy Spirit this morning hey man Isaiah chapter 14 in verse 24 the Bible says here the Lord of Hosts hath sworn saying surely I have thought so shall it come to pass you see every time God thinks of thought and then it's materialized it has to come to pass and as I have purposed soul shall it stand that I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains shred him underfoot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon the nations upon all the nations for the Lord of Hosts hath purposed who shall disown hold it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back Genesis chapter 24 verse 1 a very very familiar scripture to us as believers things that we are very very aware of the Bible says here and Abraham was old and well stricken and AIDS and the Lord had blessed Abraham and all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the God of heaven the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife under my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac and the servant said unto Him her adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me under this land must I needs bring my son again under the land from whence thou camest and Abraham said unto Him beware that thou bring not my son vivir again the Lord God of heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying under thy seed will I give this land notice he shall send His angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife under my son from thence I solve our hearts before the Lord this morning Heavenly Father we approach your your throne of mercy and grace this morning Lord Jesus we desire father none other than that the mercy of God the Lord which truly do not want that judgment father Lord we stand here Lord Jesus as a people that have that has been ransomed and has been bought and paid with the precious blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ father I stand here behind this holy desk where great men have stood before Lord our pastor and senior pastor and great of God that have came and preached to us the father I feel so insufficient to be able and so unworthy to speak the things of God the Lord I don't feel like myself as myself is adequate enough to be able to to think and to be able to bring on the things of God that you have laid out before us Lord Lord we stand here not upon our own righteousness Lord we stand here upon thy righteousness Lord not upon our own works our own merits but Father we stand here under the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we pray that thou would is not here just our voice but you would hear our voice calling through that blood sale of our Lord Jesus I pray that you would speak to your children on every walk of life where they're at father in their situations whether it's healing or or deliverance or whether it's a paralysis of fear father may you attack the enemy today by your word and may you set the captive free father Lord I pray that you'd bless your children Lord the word has been read now we pray that your spirit would come and awaken a hearts Lord quicken us make us alive to the things of God and stir up our pure minds by the way of remembrance Lord would be careful to serve you and give you all the glory and honor I get myself out of the way and I pray that you would anoint me from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet in the name of Jesus Christ we pray these things and the bride says a man here and that's your home a man god bless you you can be seated this morning in the presence of the Lord we we realize that what we are seeing and what we have seen in our life and what we are very familiar with in this day is that the things that we are very acquainted with that this is a happening that there is something that is that is transpiring that things that are happening that the the almighty god the omnipotent God the the God who is the god which was and the God that will forever be has became tangible a God that we can touch it was just it was not just for a woman in the Bible they had a blood issue that that she could reach out or touch and then the leper that he could touch but here we have manifested before us in this hour things of the things that we we we never would have been able to understand unless we would have had the eagle eye of a prophet to be able to to release in this hour things that that God had in his mind and we see that that in this hour that the mighty God the God that created the heavens and the earth that that spinned the orbit that spin the orbits and the things right off of the fingertips and he spoke those things into existence that this God has became flesh and this god has been made known to us unveiled to us made clear to us and we for once as human beings are able to touch God handle God and I brother on was speaking some things to me be the weekend that he spoke before he spoke he he was speaking some things to me on this manner about dealing with children and whatnot that if you tell a child not to do something that that they'll just they'll go and touch it and he was speaking on a family that dealt with instruments that he that they the father had set out instruments in their in their in each and individual room and he told he told his children not to touch them and this pertaining and that he knew that they would go out and touch them know that it is at nighttime and he would he'd tell him not to touch him but they go in that room at nighttime and they would go and they would touch those instruments and before long they had created themselves saying a family band and any and acquire at home and each of them were gifted in that manner and you know that if somebody tells you not to touch wet paint you know what a human does they'll reach out and they'll touch that wet paint because if you tell somebody not to do something yet you'll watch that human element in them as they'll go out and they they just can't handle it they'll touch it and I you know it you see it when you see yes and he would tell he would tell people that he would heal and he would minister to them not to touch him he knew that they would go out and they would tell what had happened in their life and you see each and every one of us have been touched in this life we've touched him we've handled him he's minister to us he's he's touched her life in so many ways and so many different elements and we've watched the unveiling of God right before us think about in this hour a of people a little broad that that that may be cast off by the world but she has an access to be able to reach out and touch the mighty God that is unveiled before her and we have seen that this has been God that has displayed himself and making himself known to us releasing his purpose in this hour and upon his children releasing the things of God you see we didn't know the mind of God man man were presuming and they were before the seals were released brother Branham would tell you that that I was presuming into those things I was I was adventuring into those things but here with a revelation you're not just pursuing or moving forward as in the dark but here it is plainly laid out before you in the light of this hour in this evening light you are watching none other than Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever as he's dispersing himself in a people and we here we spoke to you last weekend on those attributes that God had in him of attributes of Savior attributes of father attributes to be a son to be a healer to be a savior and what more but today we want to look at this load on the attributes of God of expressing himself as the husband the husband God just like when he created Adam that when he created Adam he made Adam to have dominion over the whole earth Adam had dominion over nature and he was able to speak to nature he was able to to speak to the tree and if the was blowing through my ticket he could stop wind in its pod he could he can move this Center the other and he would he would see as the tiger would come forth and he would name that tiger he would name the DeLeo the line he would name the birds of the air according to their nature and their characteristic that God had put on the inside of them but only inside of a hat though he had though he had to the natural companions of a sheet of the tiger and Leo the lion and the birds of the air the eagle would come and sit down in the garden but yet there was slumping on the inside of Adam that he longed for and it was something that maybe you as a human you know when you first fell in love you couldn't explain it but there was something that was throwing you to your loved one or to your spouse to your mate but there was something on the inside of Adam buddy that he couldn't quite Express yet it was only inside of him but he couldn't express it because you see he was a man he had dominion but he could not he could not converse with the lion yeah you know there's a lot of people that have dogs and you know I've got I've got a couple of dogs there at home but you know those dogs are nice to talk to but those dogs turn their head and flop their ears and look at me and don't have a clue what I'm talking about and sometimes I look at them the same way they act a certain way I have to get on and for tearing up Jack or whatnot but you see they do not understand like I understand they cannot converse to me and you can imagine as Adam as he's watching the lion as he's watching the tiger he's not able to converse but there was something on the inside of Adam that he longed to deal with an intellect that was able to converse back to him that was able to speak to him something that was on a higher level higher than a beast higher than a foul higher than the denomination of the world somebody that could reverse and converse with him on the level of human so God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and out of Adam's side God did the first surgery and took from Adam a rib and he closed asleep and he did the first surgery and he called and he brought out the woman Adam looked on the woman and he called her because she was from man so he called her woman for saying that she is bowling my pony she is flesh of my flesh you see here God was displaying himself in the attributes in his created son he was showing the manifestation of showing himself his husband through his son and we look and we see in our scripture reading that God was committed to the purpose to bring forth a wife when you look at Abraham and Abraham sending out Eliezer and Abraham having a desire that that his son Isaac would have a wife and him choosing his his eldest servant Eliezer that he sent out Elias or to hunt down a bride to go out and take her don't take her from the land that we're living in in this land the foolish things that'll fight you in front of your face but go into my country go into my kindred and get a blood relationship go and get a woman that that is that is connected to me you're gonna realize as it is as this woman is portrayed in front of Eliezer that this woman's gotta be a woman of character she's gotta be a woman of grace she's gotta be a woman that carries herself not like a woman but as a lady that carries herself with character whether somebody's around or somebody's not around but you can imagine this has this responsibility as it follows on a leisure soda that I've got to get my master a body I've got to get him abroad that is suitable to his request you see in Eleazar as he sings floral upon his shoulder it's these things fall upon his shoulder he's told that he can't pull just yet don't pull right yet you'll catch just a little fence you see the responsibility that was placed on him it was not just about getting those of the first pool in the second pool but it was getting those that would be a bride for him that was not just attracted to the signs and attracted to the orders and attracted to the gifts but a wife that loves him that loves him in good times loves him in bad times Oh hallelujah you can imagine this as Eleazar is standing in this spot as he's there and there's nobody else around him sure there's middle of Eleazar the Bible tells us that that as Eleazar came in that his men came in with him and we have watched Eleazar in this day and the gospel and the men of the gospel death that has spread this word that God is asking and he's calling for a body but Eleazar here he is forced he is forced with a decision to make a decision whether to go but Eleazar when he had the assurance that the angel of the Lord was going before him you see then he could be committed to go because he knew that there was something that would back him up Oh hallelujah there's an angel that has went before the bride of Jesus Christ in Exodus he tells us in Genesis he tells us in the New Testament he tells us that I would never leave thee that I would never forsake thee that I am sending an angel before thee to keep thee in the way so walked he in it so when he had this assurance he knew that there was something because he had something that would back him the Rebbe said I think that ought to be the source of every man of God that preaches the gospel that he's got something positive from God that'll back up what he preaches if he ain't if you're havin gotta brethren it's for you God still senses men with an angel before him when he goes to take his message to the church hallelujah hallelujah not only that but when Eleazar left for father Isaac which represented the father of Christ he loaded the whole train of camels with good gifts for the bride oh I feel religious right now oh how I love Jesus he loaded the camels full of good gifts to give to the bride he never told her that they were for another generation or another day but they were for the brass so many people want to put these things off into another day or the day you'll bow someday in the future but the Bible tells us that now are we the sons of God that we have full access as the son of gods as an heir to the throne to the things of God whoo hello and every true servant of God that sent out has got a whole book full of divine promises that he can offer to the bride and I'm so glad of that he's got good he's got good he's got gifts in there for her and he will not hold any of him back he will not hold any of them back I want you to catch it he will not hold any of them back he will not hold any of them back he knows who you are if you could realize your position in Christ he's not holding anything back from you if you need healing if you need to liver it's if you need saving he's not holding anything back from you he will give every one of them freely as through serving a model serving a serving that God can put trust in he won't try to hide it back from her because he knows that she is the oncoming Queen what kind of minister of the gospel Jesus Christ would I be if I told you that this book that we love and this book that we cherish that we over daily what kind of minister would I be if I told you that the things of God that are in here for a day gone by what kind of God are we serving if he's not the same yesterday today and forever he got denominations that make up their mind and say that they though those things are those things were just for the apostles or those things were just for for certain ones in the Babur or for a select group if they're for a group it's gotta be this group it's gotta be this wife hallelujah hallelujah his promises are laid out before his children if you're gonna realize that you are the queen of heaven and he's laid out everything before you and that he's committed to you I hope you catch my drift this morning that that Almighty God the all-sufficient one the all-powerful one that God who sees the God that watches you has is committed to bringing you to his purpose - it's fulfilled end there's a reason why Satan know what you listening there's a reason why Satan wants to keep you so I paralyzed by fear and he wants to keep you as it were envelope in your own humanity and not release your faith to the things of God you know it's a dangerous thing when the child figures out how to get up in the refrigerator and get their milk out for the cereal because then they begin to act on their own and sometimes you get a mess sometimes you get a mess they may they may pour a little bit out here or may pour a little bit out or maybe spill a little bit here but I'd say that there are some people of God that have really created some messes to Satan they've created because you see they think if one is good two is better hallelujah that if I can preach this and if I can see one saved what will it do if I preach it to a thousand I preach it to the world Alleluia they create a mess the Satan's Kingdom when they go into action for themselves he's committed to you church he's not forgotten you in this pandemic he's been right there the whole time he's not left you and it's not planning on leaving you he's committed to you his promises are for you we've told you this a hundred times probably but there's 88 hundred promises of God in the Bible and every one of them are true there's nine promises from the devil in the Bible and every one of them every single time he lied he can't keep his word but God can he's committed hallelujah well the Bible says in Psalms 103 bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all of our diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowns thee with the loving kindness and his tender mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things somebody say good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles that Eagle is able to go up and renew itself he's when he gets to the age of 40 years old he's able to make a decision in his life whether he wants to die but whether he wants to fly higher Oh hallelujah you satisfied our mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the Eagles the promises of God renew your strength renew your joy renew your happiness renew your health renew your life a little Eagle fly past yourself flyable top of the mountain and renew your strength and take your flight of rebirth you don't belong you know Malloy in traditions along in sickness renew thyself Lord Lord help us today now we know that Wesley in his hour that he had he had more light than what Luther did we know that Pentecost had had outshine Wesley because you see it gradually is let loose as it did down through the prophets and so forth till it was perfectly made known the Godhead bodily in Christ and now the Christ in the church is just being made known the whole thing the whole thing is the revelation of God to take Eve back to her right position again with her husband notice and God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride the whole thing is the revelation of God and bringing you back to your rightful position you see Eve turn this down but the eve of this last day will not turn it down you see it was once the anointed man but now it is anointed bride and bride through this he the bridegroom as he's going out as every young man as he begins to look out look out of home the ladies of grace as he's looking out he's looking for a mate he's looking for a lady of character now a man now a man that goes out and he starts looking for women of the world you can notify and notice his character immediately but if you watch a man how that he handles himself and how he looks for a certain wife how he's looking for a character maybe maybe a lady then maybe a lady let's just put it in human points maybe a lady that knows how to cook her biscuits and gravy that knows how to make a good strawberry pie that knows how to do things according according to a woman you see he's watching for certain elements in her life that she displays and boys I want to give you a little bit of advice here if you don't like her mother law you probably won't like her because you see there are traits that are passed down that are passed down from father to son and from mother to daughter so you see I hope my mother lost listen to this today but there are traits that are passed down that matter that do you see that his characters are later and that man is watching for those Saints he's watching for those things and he's watching and you see what you really didn't know what the man was fully about until he chose himself a bride and when you see that man choose himself a bride you see what was really on the inside of him if he chooses a lady of the world it shows what's on the inside of him but if he chooses a lady of the message it shows what's on the inside of him you see because he's longing for a partner that's connected with the headship you see we really didn't know what was in God's mind until he chose you he didn't choose a woman of this grace but he chose a woman of grace hallelujah he didn't choose a woman that was corrupted by the seed of man or the ideologies and the traditions of man but he chose a woman that was a virgin that was justified as if she never done it in the first place yeah there were scars on her life but he chose a woman hallelujah that portrayed himself you could see his desire you could see his grace you can see his majesty when he chose a lady of grace you could see what was really in God's mind notice notice in the Pergamon church age the word of promise came to the Virgin Mary but that word of promise was he himself to be made manifest God was made manifest he himself acted time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virtue it was an angel that had brought her the message by the angels message was the Word of God Isaiah 9 and 6 he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the virgin bride will love him and they will have his potentials who for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our bodies are subject to our head notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father John 5 and 19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life notice he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it she never lets reason and get involved she never lets race he never lets her own thinking get involved she never lets a man's Ally ology get involved she never doubts it she never doubts it therefore I love that therefore you see these promises are to you but therefore nothing can harm her because she never doubts it and therefore because she never lets reasoning it in a way therefore hallelujah because Satan can't get advantage of her therefore therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again here is the secret of this the word is in the bride can somebody say Amen as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for and she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word his name not her name but his name it is not hello she it is not hello her it is hello him she can perform so command of the word in his name what is the name of Jesus what is the name of God it's none other than Jesus for she has thus hath the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass I know that it's hard for some people in their natural elements who understand these things but to a people that the word has been quickened to and you realize that those sayings are sovereignly given that you said the right word at the right time that the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass when you say that ain't nothing but the truth you see it's like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise come on some by those in the bride do only his will if I lay something out before sister Katie and I tell her that this is the way that it should be done this is a way that you are now hacked nobody else is her head but me and is not down there that does not make her my doormat that I walk over all over top of her but I love her as Christ loved the church but as I laid out the guideline and the things that are set forth there's nobody that can talk her out of it if she's under the headship and connected to that head she will do what the head says do and you are watching her body some people call you peculiar some Komba some people call you holy rollers some people make fun of you some people call you brand of mites but that ain't the truth will not branagh mites we are messiah and there's not one man on earth that can make us do otherwise than the head because there's a perfect union if the connection between the head and the bride who lord give me strength to get through this today she knows that for that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time not in the eighth day not in a different day but in this specific time has he called a people by his namesake to do and perform the command in his name that's why you see ministers of the gospel like brother on that has a ministry from God you realize that that ministry didn't come from some manner passed down because of family members of nine generations of preachers there's not a man that could say the things that a ministry like brother honor brother Tim brother Donnie whatsoever would say things because you realize that they are connected to a headship and you watch things as those men of God they let the promises of God loose and they don't even realize what they have said sometimes sometimes we as ministers of God we have to step back and put her hand over her mouth and say did we really say that because we realize that we are responsible for everything that we say but when he says it he's responsible for everything that he said hallelujah the pillar fire has not left us the pillar virus here the pillar fire is working he's not he's not just somewhere far off in distance he's here he's here and performing his word in this house in this day I know that they are let me just make let me just make some of these statements right here I know that there are some that listen to these things in our community they do not understand maybe everything that we are displaying to you today but I want to assure you that this is a living God that is amongst us that if you would see the performance of Christ you would realize that no man has received these things of himself but they came from God when we think about the miracles that have transpired in our own little local body here of some to 100 250 people we think about the miracles that have transpired and we think about the visions that have came forth and then we think about the laying on of hands and and then the the supernatural gets involved and you watch the natural become so spiritual eyes and so quickened by the supernatural that is what we are putting before everyone today that this is not a God that is dead we're not serving a god like Buddha we're not serving a god like Muhammed were serving a god that has come off the pages in this hour and it's manifesting himself that's why we see the dead race that's why we see the barren become and have life in their womb that's why we see cancers falling off with people because he's here he's here how oh you don't have to wait for him like the disciples did on the day of Pentecost having to wait 10 days from his ascension he's here oh you have to do is receive him but we realized that there is a capacity in the ability to be able to receive just like when Jesus is standing there in Matthew chapter 19 and 11 he said he makes this comment that all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given if you look at another translation it says that all men do not have the capacity to be able to receive these things there are individuals and there are people that do not have the understanding and they do not have the the revelation of the hour it's because they have not been born again but if you have truly been born again and sealed to the day of your redemption you see the things of God I happen to believe with everything that is within me that if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about some some fleshly thing that you feel on you and you felt when the preacher was preaching or when the preacher laid his hand upon you but I'm talking about a good old-fashioned Pentecostal revival on the inside of your soul where you know that you know that you know that you got it that if you got the full baptism of the Holy Ghost you will come to the word of the hour because how could you be of God and deny a part of his word sure there's a lot of Christians today but how many what percentage is there I'd say it's maybe less than 1% that have a full baptism of the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost is not something that you as an individual that you control it is something that controls you you see here's your head you don't tell your head when you want to sin and when you want to get power certain things your head keeps you in line and keeps you from sin and keeps you from doing this or keeps you from doing that it's a Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it's Jesus there are some that do not have the capacity to be able to receive this baptism of the Holy Ghost because they have not fully walked in the way of God they've not completely committed themselves to God but I want you to know this that if you seek God with everything that is within you and I want to preach to you today that there's a Holy Ghost for you that if you have not got it you can get it I want to preach to you that there's a God of healing for you today that if you have not got it yet you can get it I want to preach to you today that there's a God of deliverance that if you ain't got it you can get it I want to preach to you a God of the promises of the Bible that maybe you ain't seen them but you can see them I want to preach to you today a Living God that is committed to his promises that's committed to bringing it to pass hallelujah he's got every good gift for his bride he's laid them out there for you well you see God deals with every individual in their own capacity you see he'll speak to some maybe those may be those that are city folk God will deal with them individually but he'll deal with country people in a different way he'll deal with you and maybe maybe he'll deal with you by nature or maybe he'll do you deal with you by the lights of the city or however he may deal with you just like he would deal with David King David David was a woodsman and David had the capacity to be able to receive from God and express Christ in the manner of a woodsman and he would say in Psalms chapter 23 that he leadeth me beside the still waters and he lays me down and green pastures you see he was reading he was he was grasping and expressing Christ in the capacity that he was able to receive Christ in are you with me and in the inspiration that God could express himself and dispersed himself and he deals with each and every one of you did differently ah I I have dreams and I have things I don't have this I don't have visions but my dad does brother a brother out and brother Eldin can have a word from the Lord I can watch his brother out of would will speak things a brother Steve Thomas he'll was a man that was so spiritual that when you watch brother Steve Thomas excuse me for always bringing him up he's just a big part of my family he's a big part of my past a big part of my my future as well and who you watch men of God that were led by the Spirit of the Lord you watch what a man like brother Steve Thomas were brother Leo hen sleep when those men of God would come forward and they would say they got a word from Lord you could watch those things transpire because they were so honed to the Spirit of God that God could express himself through now just because you did not have a gift or do not be able to speak in tongues or whatever that does not mean you do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I would rather have him than to have his gifts hello I know I'm not following a Pentecostal that Pentecostal doctrine used to tell people that if they didn't speak in tongues they didn't have it what speaking in tongues is one of the least of gifts but to have him you know at Christmastime when you get a Christmas gift when you get it from somebody you know when they send it from you from somewhere far off in some distance it's better to have the giver than to have the gift oh hello but you see I want you as I said to you last week here that he has not asked you to do what you what you do not have the capacity to do he did not ask you to do what you did not have the capacity to do now capacity is it is the meaning of it is the power of receiving or container it is being able to fully occupy the available area or space now the government has told us that they want us to work at 50% capacity they want us to work at 50% capacity but God is not asking you to work at 50% capacity he's asking you to work at your full capabilities there's abilities that he's put on the inside of the bra that will Express none other than Jesus you may be able to just seat half people in full gospel I have but only inside of your soul such a throne room of your heart that has the capacity to be able to handle the word of truth the word in this hour whoa hallelujah and Satan hates you for that he despises you for your power he despises you for your position because even though he was he was a song leader in heaven he was a right-hand man to God in heaven he could not have that power some people say well I'm the weakest Christian and all the church if you're the weakest Christian you still have more power than every devil in hell has hallelujah hallelujah you remember when Jesus is standing there in Matthew chapter 25 and he sets forth the parable of the talents then he gave some five and he gave some two and he gave some one and the Bible said that he gave to those according to their own ability and you remember that those that were given the talents that when the husbandmen turn returned back the one that he gave five returned and showed him that he gained five more and the one that had two had gained double-fold but the one had buried it because he knew that his master was a hard master and that if he lost it he would criticize him and say he has a prayer paraphrasing here but he was a hard master you see each of them was given in their ability to be able to express Christ each of them had their own capacity to be able to release to release their talents release their abilities and each of them were built different but God gave to you in your capacity to be able to receive man in the book of Matthew right after Jesus speaks Jesus speaks of these talents right after speaking the five wise and the five foolish virgins you see each of them had a capacity but what made the five wise what's the oil on the inside of them they all had a capacity to be able to receive but what made them wise was the Holy Ghost it is not it was not in there himself they were all virgins they were all virgins but it was the oil hill it was the Holy Ghost that made them who they were that made them wise and this Holy Ghost is what makes the body of Jesus Christ what makes her wise in this hour it gives her the capacity to be able to handle the things of God you watch somebody even though they're built just the same way as you you can watch as the Word of God comes forth and you could speak it the same way you hear the same way but some will receive it in summer turn to death just like when Jesus said ruin the book of John said in John chapter 1 that he came into his own and his own received him not but to them but to them but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us the same Paul said when he comes to Philippians 2 and 5 let this mind be in you which was also in the headship Christ let this mind be in you and with Paul is standing there in first Corinthians 2 and 16 I believe it was who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ you see this body ain't thinking ain't mine by thinking by her arm thinking by her foot or thinking by her finger she's thinking from a headship she's moving by head chef you see his mind is your capacity to be able to receive let this mind that word let means allow allow this mind to be in you you have the capacity to be able to allow this mind to be in you to think the thoughts of Christ you see you'll notice when when Rebekah when Rebecca was returning back to see her master and when she saw her man her out in the field she asked Eleazar who is that and she veiled herself showing that she was no longer taking on her thinking but she was taking on his thinking you remember what we spoke to you and I say after verse 22 there that that that the key of David is on the shoulder that just like in the Orient times that the bride would place her very Hill over on the shoulder of the groom showing that he has full control that she is committing all of herself to him to him not somebody else to him not some man to him not some other power but to him she has the mind of Christ you notice when you watch the body move they're moving they're moving according as the head says move now I can't take a step to my right without my brain telling me to do so if I do if my brain my foot goes out when my brain goes that way something going on here y'all probably need to call the ambulance somebody to cut my head off there's some times in life when I've been in some certain situation I felt like my head was going going certain ways you're looking at a look at a man when he's riding the board sometimes he looks like he's going other ways and out but when you watch a Christian and it looks like their foot is going that way or they're always leading them that way but you know when the head tells a miss you can see that there is a loss of connection somewhere and you notice that when you watch the people of God throughout the Old Testament you watch and you look at Moses as he as he's standing there or Noah as he's standing there and he's just a farmer and he's told by a voice to go out and build an ark and the builders so many cubits long and the Builder to this turn build it this way and to go in to gather out all the animals now who's thinking was he thinking with that he wasn't thinking of Noah's thinking he was thinking of God's thinking and when Moses was standing there before Pharaoh and his great magicians and he stretched forth his rod and his Rob became a serpent whose thinking was he thinking with who was he thinking when Moses is thinking or was he thinking with God's thinking when you look at Joshua when he was standing there in the greatest battle of his life when he's looking there to showdown of his life to others to see whether God was with him or whether he was just with Moses when he was standing there and Joshua chapter 10 and then look like the army of the Assyrians was going to destroy them and he said son stand still and moon now hang there of the valley of agile on whose thinking was Joshua thinking with he had to be thinking with an intellect that was higher than his intellect are you with me when David was standing there in front of a bunch of coward his relaxed and standing there in front of a champion of champions whose thinking was he thinking with when he grabbed his sling and said today I will cut your head off whose thinking was he thinking with and when you look at cancer and say cancer I want you to know you have met your maker in the son of man that he is here to display his attributes of healer today cancer take your leave Berenice take your leave sugar diabetes take your leave arthritis take your leave hallelujah Satan take your leave who's taking are you thinking with when you start speaking what he said as I can tell you your mind will think some other thoughts your mind will think they got and committed you'll think that God has gave up you think that God don't care that's what the enemy and that's what your mind will war with that is where the greatest battle is ever father is in the mind but when you go to thicken his thoughts hallelu you have the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass but what about when you don't just think his thoughts but you start speaking his thoughts when you start saying what he said some people get off they get so disturbed and think that God will answer them God's as good as his word you're not back in Samba horse-and-buggy de hey you're in the astronaut age you're in the age that we are higher than any other intellect we are not down in the feet we are not down in the neck area but this is the day where the headship is made known to us and there is a people that have the capacity to be able to express none other than Jesus Christ where's his feet at your feet are his feet footsteps his possession just like the electricity that we enjoy here and the technology that you're enjoying on that end there was a man by the name of Benjamin Franklin that he realized that he thought there was a thought passed through his mind that he would be able to harness this great power that he's seen in the skies and when he got ahold of it he said I got it but he didn't know what he had but it took a man by the name of Thomas Edison that was able to bring forth the telegram and the light bulb and whatsoever they were able to tap in and be able to bring forth and manifest electricity and the things that you have today you see they were working in the laws of nature as electricity and whatnot they were dealing and releasing in the capacity that their mind was able to capture that now if men had the ability to be able to capture those things and release those things in the natural elements of the earth what about a son and daughter of God that is full of the power of God how much more can they be able to release the capacity and neither things of God how much more when it's received by a heart of faith and let loose from a math of faith there's a God that's backing up what he said it's like God that ain't backing up he's not giving up but he's committed to what he said he would do but we know that the Prophet would come in this day and he would preach on the invasion of the United States that he would preach that that the demon powers have set up their headquarters in Hollywood and set forth their fashions and their perversions that the demon powers have invaded that had invaded the churches they've invaded the prayers they've invaded the home and some people think it's somewhere far off but yet they let it right in their own house in their own living room what is it it is an invasion of a demonic power and what you are watching what you're watching is an invasion of the mind where you're watching em knees are setting in O people where they're thinking that it's no longer important to go to church I'm not talking about through this whole Coronas virus couldn't nobody color Church but the few chosen but I'm talking about people that have allowed an amnesia what they were called to be as sons and daughters of God they were put here to serve his purpose it's an invasion of the mind and you'll watch as they give their mind and once they start chasing after the things of man that God turns them over to a reprobate mind when they start chasing men start chasing men and women start chasing women and on every ungodly perversion it's an invasion of the mind when you see men joining the BSS Society the big society and they putting all the women's clothes and putting on a man's foot no no woman's undergarments and the woman's putting on the man's garments it's a perversion it's an invasion of the mind who is making them think those things it's not Christ it's an invasion that is making them think those things do those things you know we've been going through a battle as a family and brother on it's a church as a as a body we've been watching what we have been watching is an invasion on brother ons brain how that this cancer has invaded his brain and it calls these tumors those tumors were malignant tumors those tumors were a foreign object they were not meant to be there God did not for Dain him but there was a demonic power that transferred and invaded itself through the sails through a brew cell and invaded the mind and the brain a brother on and you watched as we were told that those tumors were putting swelling on the brain and they had to go in and they had to go in and release the pressure off of that invasion that had transpired in his brain it was causing and it calls his eyesight on his left side so he lost our peripherals from about right here what was it it was telling us that there was an invasion on the brain of brother a huntsman but doctors by the way of science were able to go in there with their instruments and cut that invasion out and pull that invasion out they did gamma radiation and they worked on that invasion what were they doing they were working by the way that they knew to get that invasion that thing that had so slipped its way in there so secretively brother on didn't know about it until his vision started to go how much more and things in your life you don't really know about it until you start watching a snowball effect and you'll see you'll source it back and you'll find that there is an invasion somewhere if you watch if your prayer life is went downhill you'll watch where doubt has start to enter in if you watch when a person no longer respects what the pastor says well the children no longer respects what the pastor says you are watching an invasion of the enemy by saying certain things and doing certain things that is afflicting them so that they cannot respect the headship it's an invasion it's telling you that something is wrong and when you watch when you watch the Church of God as she's moving forward as he goes forward in these things if she's not moving to the beat thus saith the Lord you're watching an invasion on the mind that there is something there that is causing a pressure to keep her from the things of God but there is a surgery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that'll go on the inside of the inside and it'll cut that invasion out it'll cut that tumor out it'll cut that cancer out it'll cut that sin out just like this Corona vas is ho Corona fires it's been an invasion its invaded all of our homes it's invaded us it's made a shut-in its met us being locked down it's disrupted our worship it's just RuPt in our prayer life it's disrupted some of our faith but Satan cannot stop the bride's mouth you were put here for a purpose you are put here to bring forth hallelujah Jesus said and I say that so somehow word me so say my word go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish at once I said it to do this is a sign that you cannot stop us you cannot stop the purpose of God they say can maybe knocking us he may beating us he may even be trying to kill at us but we will rise again and Satan will loose because you cannot defeat the purpose of God and what God has imagined in his mind what he is purpose in his thoughts that will he do because his purpose will stand hallelujah his purpose was stand you know that before they ever had a choice God chose Jacob overtop of Esau when they were still in their mother's womb God still chose Jacob before he saw can make a choice before Jacob could make a choice he chose them hallelujah he didn't choose a perfect people he didn't choose the people that were perfect he didn't choose the people that were righteous he chose the illiterate he chose the cast down he chose to reject it he chose a Gentile people that were pagan worshipers that was over he the nation Gentiles that were cut off from God that were without mercy without hope in the world that were idol worshipers that were going on their way to a Devil's hail and a sinner's grace but the Bible tells us to a sinner's grave the Bible tells us that he took a people out of the Gentiles for his namesake sure there's people out there that are better qualified than you that's got a better resume than you he saw had a better resume than take up debt he saw was qualified he saw was subjected to his father he saw cared for his father he saw was more religious Jacob Moses hyster Jacob was a trouble maker Jacob was a liar but before Jacob or Esau could ever make a choice hallelujah God had chose them and you did not choose herself Rebecca didn't choose herself Eleazar didn't choose herself choose her God chose her hallelujah before you ever smoked before you ever drink before you ever dope before you ever did anything God chose you Jesus said that I came not to call the righteous but I came to call the sinners to repentance he didn't come he didn't come because he told them they that her whole don't need a physician but they that are sick and with Jesus is standing there and Luke 14 and he starts speaking to them on the wedding feast in the wedding banquet about those that had been given an invitation and those that had give the invitation he had given the invitation to come they came up with every ungodly excuse to not come to his banquet and he went and he told his servants he said go out in the highways go out in the head with hedges go out there on the streets call the prostitutes call the blame call the lame call the hog call the body what was he doing he was calling his first healing campaign to come to his banquet he was calling those that had a start up past who his banquet he was calling those that were hopeless those that were helpless you like yourself that was blinded by Pentecostal traditions that was poor in spiritual things and so disfigured as a human being but yet he compelled you to come that there's a place for you though you may have been so scarred up with so many things done so many dirty deeds in your life but God rich in mercy when you heard him talking about Isaac Alleluia there was something that told you that poacher and wrote you I have to tell you that for the first fooling catch me the second Poole didn't catch me but when he started talking to me on the third pole on the opening of the word when I seen God manifested before me I started seeing myself in the word and it's brother William Boyle if I'm preaching a little while ago mama that's me I see my reflection in the word and I say hey he's not talking about a day gone by he's talking about this day he's talking about this hour alleluja alleluja another yeah the church has received their revival but the bride is in her of a hovel the bride has the word the bride has thus saith the Lord and she is there in a revival it's not any good thing that you done on your own but he called you by his purpose to be the elect lady of God I hear a prophet screaming out and saying before the foundation of the world he put your name on the blams book of life and he slipped on your band slipped on your finger the wedding band of unmerited grace upon your life who did only he you look on your life you see the scars you see your past you see the mistakes you did Oh God rich in mercy God rich in mercy a Bible says in Ephesians 5 and 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for word that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish you remember you remember when the Prophet was caught up in the preview of the bride how that he gave the description of that bride as she came forth how that she was lovely she was a pretty young she was walking just the step as she could not a march but as a stride of a woman how that they walk gracefully and ladylike she was walking and going and she and she passed from his sight but then he watched the church from each age how that she came up how she was so vulgar and how she was so dirty and then he watched the Church of the last day the Church of USA how that she was led by hitch she was so in Mohali trash so filthy looking and they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll and those women throwing themselves just in twist and withholding just paper gray hypocrite ho creeper critical the gray between white and black which is a deceiving color and the profit by the random said that had begin to give faint life and you begin to think oh my oh my is this the best that I've done is this what I am presenting to Christ on a lady of disgrace a lady that is so hypocritical that is moving and it's twisting and turning oh you can imagine as Ellie is her standing the hair that I have got to present to my master a wife the responsibility is laying on his shoulder is this the best that I've done these years of ministry in these years of searching in these years of hunting is this the best that I've done but then there was a voice it came the bride will come and preview again and here came that bride the very same looking bar that passed by at the beginning he said then my heart began to jump for joy to know that there will be a bride that she will be made of the same thing clothed in the same thing that that's the one who was at the beginning she is to be cold you see the bride is not standing with the Methodist garment horn that is spotted up with because they've been doing so many works but the bride is lining up with the message and then let's when they catch that message they line up every time and this body of Christ she's not a freak body that's got six fingers or got some fungus on it he's got a perfect body and he's the perfect bird the perfect word and the church will be sewed and believed in the perfect word and the perfect word and the perfect word will unite together one flesh and one body as husband and wife just like Rebecca which she realized when there was when there was a blood connection between the truth they were blood cousins there was a connection between Isaac and Rebecca and just like the broad of his last day she is a blood ball bride she's a blood wolf's bride no wonder she has led by the Holy Spirit there is a connection that the two are coming together there is a union that has taken place before you could ever think of thought before you could ever choose cross he chose you but when Rebecca came out she didn't come out wearing a bikini like the Church of the modern day but she came out dressed and the bride has the material on earth right now to dress herself with and there is a five fold ministry the dress wear of God that is dressing his bride hallelujah you see when that light struck a little Rebecca she knew something within her that brought her to Isaac and she failed her face she wanted no more to do with her think she wanted to think his thoughts Isaac was her thinking from then on some people can handle that thought but I don't want him just lord over my heart I want him Lord over my mind I want him Lord over all things and the church itself when it strikes that power of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost has the denominational churches of the Catholic Church of wherever it is when that baptism of the Holy Ghost is made real to the people them that's written ated like you people here to return a life see and walks in it what is it it's a super side it's a super sign to the rest of the world that this mystery of his will that he chose you according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself and you have obtained an inheritance because you were predestinated according not to your purpose but to his purpose you see the message is the key that unlocks the mysteries of God and without this message the loose ends are still loose without this message the book is still sealed are you with me without this message the bride is not in her position without this message the bride does not know her position but we are no longer presuming we know where we're at are you with me Church there has been churches churches Brides Brides but there's must common one that not only has the mechanics but the dynamics that is fully manifesting the power of his resurrection he is committed to her sure the church turn this down sure the world turned this down sure they laughed at Christ they laughed at Christ because they thought of that day that God cannot have a body that God cannot walk but they were blinded by their traditions and they missed and they could not recognize that the Messiah was standing in human flesh but we are promised we are promised that he would manifest himself in this hour in the form of son of man as he did in the days of rod so shall I do and the revealing of the son of man and here you are watching a body as she begins to eat this word she don't just eat 50% of the capacity of it but she eats the whole lamb she becomes what the lamb is she gets his thinking she turns down her thinking you see not only is he committed but she is I when it come down to a time of decision for Rebecca to make her decision whether she would go or not you see there was a mother and a brother that stood up and said letter tarry here but Eleazar said don't hinder my work seeing that the age of the Lord has done this don't hinder the work of God don't hinder the work of the angel seeing he's been doing that it's done this church Full Gospel lighthouse yeah we've had a disruption in our in our local services but do not hinder the work of the Lord when you come back in here don't let the coronavirus feeder hinder the work of the angel it's been the angel that has been in this it's from the angel that has been working don't you lose your help don't you lose your worship don't you lose your praise [Music] Alleluia don't you lose what you were given to just because you've been away as it were on a little vacation from this local body don't you lose her praise don't you lose your dance don't you lose your shout don't you lose your dance don't you lose your victory hallelujah you gotta make a decision like Rebecca made her decision she was not choosing eleazar and eleazar did choose her but God had chose Rebecca because of the blood connection and she did not choose le ISA oh I love I love the portion of le he's I love what the messenger of this they did but I am NOT in love with the messenger I am not in love I am not in love with Malachi 4 but I am in love with revelations 10:1 I am in love with that mighty angel has come down that has directed our thinking that has directed our thoughts I am in love with him Oh hallelujah I appreciate Elise I appreciate him pointing me to Isaac because without Eliezer I couldn't have found my Isaac but with my a Lisa hallelujah he pointed me to my Isaac and my Isaac will take me see how did Eliezer know how did Elias or know that this was the one she matched she matched a prayer she matched to the message you see there's a reason there's a reason why we know the rest of the world don't understand but there's a reason why we know you have matched what he has said you have matched what he has prayed you have masked what he has said in his word Rebekah when they come to her spot when the rest of the churches were watching her what she would choose and she said will full gospel Lighthouse we start when we start back to church next weekend and it may be a little bit different but don't you forget to water the camels that had brought you to your Isaac you see when she came when she came when Ellie's was there not only did she water and bring forth drink for Lisa but she watered the camels the Beast that was taking her to her Isaac and you when you water this word with praise you are watering the camel that has taken you to glory Oh hallelujah you can praise them in your home you can praise them in your car you can praise hoovering Zimbabwe and over in Ghana and over Indonesia you can praise Him this camel the word of the hour will pack you in the glory if there's ever a time we ought to water this word of our prayer with our praise it's this time for it is our decision that shows that shows who we are don't lose your shout don't lose your dance you may have to come in here with a face mask on you may have to come in here with gloves on you may have to come in here dressed up like a Klu Klux Klan I don't care how you come in here but don't you lose your praise because when you go to water in this word yeah we're going to dismiss you by row by row but we will not give up on our worship we will sing to you we will sing to you we will worship with you because we are watering the camel the word that will take us to our bridegroom and when you come in here I don't care if your clap sounds a little funny because you got gloves off I don't care if your voice sounds a little muff because you've got a mask on but let it loose let your voice fly let so praises loose let let you water this word with your praise you've been given a capacity and he's not asking you to do what you did not have the capacity to do I hope you I hope you understand that thought to me the thought is overwhelming you maybe learn a bit more advanced than I am but to me the thought is overwhelming many you don't understand why why I'm speaking these things and maybe that's for a future date but there has been given a capacity to you as the body of Jesus Christ to do what only you can do not a little wife she can only do there in another woman on earth that can do what she does I love everything about her everything that she does because she's my wife and to be honest she's my better half ain't a whole lot good on this half but on that half it's a whole whole lot of good you see you see what you are expressing as a wife you're expressing in him as a husband you see she can only do what she does there's nobody else on earth that we're not at at the end of the day and my mind is scattered and so tore up and so discombobulated she has a way maybe it's a military way or not jerk me back in her line I have heard a voice to get back in line little bride but also I've been given a wife to help me sometimes hey shake yourself I may not be able to get cereal but on Fridays but praise God some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow some of you never get it I'm glad you never get it but you see God has given us a counterpart to take care of us and there's nobody that can operate like sister Katie you know there's nobody that can make healthy biscuits and gravy like her she's trying to keep me in line for some reason I don't know why but I'm so thankful that I've got a wife who takes care of me that looks out for me and I say those things just to kind of give you a little bit of break from myself but I think how does our character reflect you how does our life show him are we so caught up with the coronavirus are we so so caught up with the things of life so so concerned and so fearful that we forget our purpose in life to show for film he were put here for a purpose let us express that purpose like a never before you know as the musicians Comus his David servants went out when David asked for a fresh drink of water from the wells of Bethlehem you see his desire was a command and they fought all the way I think it was some fifteen miles that they had fought through Philistines just to get to that certain level and from high understanding there are three different wells in Bethlehem but there was a certain one that David was speaking out that he wanted this fresh drinking water from you see only the elect know how to bring him that fresh drink of Pentecostal water let us in our desire let us in our worship let us in our praise let us manifest and bring forth a fresh drink of water I pray that our life is not bitter I pray that our water that we bring forth is not bitter it's not it's not just it's got wiggle tails in it but may our praise come forward as a sweet-smelling Savior unto him may it come forth and may his desire be a command to us his wife to bring him the things of God may we sing a song fill my lord [Music] Oh calm and quit which sister stinker of my soul Oh bread of ever Oh [Music] here's my car [Music] [Applause] passionately loose [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] comments this muscle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] my car [Music] before we let you go today just in remembrance that next Saturday will have my left hand side edge but your right hand side as you enter to the church would be the side brother Joe and other Vernon you normally sit on but if you are new in the community in you receiving these services and you do not have a necessarily side that you are adjusted to setting on please just come and we will make you make preferences or make a way for you to come and be a part of these services and then Sunday morning at 11 o'clock we will be having the the left-hand side of the church as you entered to come that we know Sunday night service just Saturday night Sunday morning we feel to move forward in these in these things at this current time and so we just want to move forward into things that God is blessing and so just to keep those things before you be remembering to come early and come prayerful don't forget to pray for me and pray for your brothers pray for your sisters and and just come with a already hard to lift up and phrase to the Almighty God we just want to we just want to do our very best he gave his best for us we want to give our best for him you know there's not no there's not no requirements in the Bible that makes me wear suit but because it's the very best that I have I choose to wear the very best that I have now you may not feel that way or whatnot but that's my personal feeling that when it comes to God I want to put my best foot forward and everything that I do for him I wanted to do that way but I do know that there was a service where the Prophet went and came and he preached in this he preached in this bib over off so so you come you come how you feel to come but just come dressed praise the Lord so we just we just want to move forward in these things and we're looking forward to the things of God I have to tell you I I can't wait to be able to preach to to you and to breach them more than the Select 10 here I have enjoyed preaching to them and they have been a wonderful audience for me to be able to preach to and I can't express how much I think of them for being a part of these services and making these things available to to the bride around the world so god bless you all so much we thank you for being a part of these services these the things that you have done the brothers upstairs brother Jeremy he does so much for us and is willing to come down and spend so much time and make these things by him and brother Scottie and the girls upstairs and just so thankful for what they do for us as a body and so when you see them right now don't shake their hand but just thank them and tell them how much you appreciate the work that they have done and in bringing forth these services and I could preach to you but there's no way that I could run the things up there it's way past my understanding but I'm so thankful because that's a part of the ministry as well and so just be remembering them that this is not just something that I pull off but this is a body that pulls this off and we work together as a we work together as a team we work together I believe pretty well and we're just thankful for the team that God has surrounded us with and so we just want to go today praising the Lord and serving him for the Mathew if you wouldn't mind singing for us this afternoon may God richly bless you in the fear and admonition of the Lord we dismiss you his brother Matthew sings it said Holi goes far and it's keeping me alive [Applause] [Music] is there
