together and kind of gives us a glimpse of the foretaste of what it's going to be like on the other side and you know no time clocks one of these days we're not going to have a time clock or our bodies are not going to ache we're not going to wake up in a mood and everything's going to be perfect and so it's not disney world it's it's real that's what it's real and so we certainly certainly

speaking thursday and brother donnie will speak friday friday night and then brother wayne will speak saturday morning then i will speak saturday night and then brother donnie will speak sunday i don't know if i just gave it all away or not but i don't know if i was supposed to do that but that's what i did so i would like for you to pray for those meetings and i'd like for you to watch them if you can and so brother andrew will be here taking care of the services and so amen my dad asked me this week he said you're gone a bit and i said i'm retired [Music] so amen well i'm going to enjoy the retirement anyway i wanna god bless you so good to see each and every you every one of you guys and amen joel enjoyed that song tonight that just goes right with what we're going to speak i'd like to speak to you tonight on restored we have returned amen you'll turn with me in your scriptures tonight isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17. amen isaiah 65 and verse 17. isaiah writes the commentary of the bible and he writes not a myth but this is how it's going to happen this is in god's mind and notice if it's in god's mind he reveals it through the prophet and then the prophet writes it or speaks it and when he speaks it then that word circles the earth for literally thousands of years and one day we're going to step into it and over the last little bit i've been speaking to you and i know you've caught it before it happens you've lived a life then you capture it when it happens and then afterwards you live it so you see it before it's coming with expectation and revelation knowing it's going to come and then you enjoy the miracle or the change of your life and then you live it amen and so we're certainly thrilled that we can do that isaiah chapter 65 and verse 17 for behold i create a new heavens and a new earth and the former shall be not remembered nor come into mind what a thought but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying there shall be no more things an infinite of days nor an old man hath not filled his days for the child shall die at hundred years old but the sinner shall be a hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not be old and another inhabit they shall not plant in another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands and they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they were yet speaking i will hear notice these next words the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like a bullock and the dust shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in mine holy mountain saith the lord hallelujah that's enough to shout about right there amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to bring it before the lord and say lord i want to be better i want you to feel me more than ever before tonight while the word goes forth fill my heart with your presence lord jesus we love you tonight and we just lift our hands before you we have great need that you'd come by our way this afternoon i pray that you touch our bodies strengthen them father for the work of the lord anoint us to get not only the speaker but also the hearer anoint us to get out of the way so you can speak to our hearts father lord we ask you that you would just lift us into a heavenly presence like never before and father i pray that you would give us a temporary resurrection that you would strengthen us father anoint us anoint our mind annoying our thoughts anoint our words and you see the needs of your children now we've lifted it before you and you and with you all things are possible to them that believe i ask you to touch our hearts in jesus name amen and amen and man you can be seated tell your neighbor let's have church revelations 21 and verse 4 says it like this and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful we realize that we live in an age that all the prophets would have liked to have lived given a choice they would have wanted to live in this age the people of of the thousands and thousands of years ago had they been given the choice of what age would you want to be a part of the rapture in i would want to live in this age so we realized when god is pre-planning he chose you before the foundation of the world knowing that laodicea and all of its conditions and all of its wickedness and all of its darkness and everything that was going to be upon the earth every sodom condition that there could be every corrupt government that they could be every wickedness that there is has been loosed on the earth from the river euphrates every demon of hell has been loosed against the bride of jesus christ but god don't just anoint anoint us just to see if he can anoint us but he's pre-planned us to be the final voice to the final age he did not leave us unequipped he gave us the greatest weapons that he could give us and his words are eternal and when he speaks it he places literally hundreds and hundreds of promises at your disposal to give you the open book a book that had been sealed down through all the ages of time and he brought to this last generation that this bible could be open for us not hid with creeds and dogmas and men's teachings and men's theologies but god could send a prophet in this day a prophet with a message of the hour to open the word and to give it power and restore the church the bride of jesus christ so she stands today as a restored lady we're not bound in in in the in the hopeless camps of denominationalism going around in a circle blind and and wandering and don't have an open vision but we stand as a bride of jesus christ knowing exactly where we're at knowing what's laying just ahead of us knowing what we're stepping into now if we could just think of this just for a moment as a prophet would stand there at the end of the service and he's and he's speaking and and he's speaking about adam and eve walking out of the garden of eden how that god called them back into that perfect eden that now has the atmosphere is different and he takes lamb skins and wraps them around them brother bam talks about she was a blond-headed woman and she laid her head over on adam's strong shoulders on his chest and he said the drug the blood was dripping off of those those skins dripping down their legs as they walked out of the garden of eden god made them a promise because a part of him was walking out of the garden god's been working on this promise since adam now we're excited about the return of our lord jesus christ but can you imagine his excitement it's not an if it's going to happen his excitement is he's bringing you home he's restoring you back to where you were supposed to be in the first place hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah if you remember when brother branham has a couple of visions first of all he explains about adam and eve and he said the the other night while i was speaking and i'm just paraphrasing here so he said i watched adam and eve walk out of the garden of eden so the prophet when he calls her blonde headed was not guessing he kind of gives us a little idea about marilyn monroe and and make some comparisons there and [Music] about how beautiful eve was i'm not comparing the two now but i want you to understand that that the prophet was looking at two realms at the same time and he could see the world falling apart and see denominations selling themselves over to uh to all different kinds of things like trying to raise money who's got the biggest tent even saying the revival is over for america and it was during a time when it looked like it was at its greatest cycle but look where she's at now because a prophet is not just a preacher but he's a gift of god more than a gift of god he is elijah to this generation and so when he's standing there and he walks to the pulpit and he begins to speak sermons like restoration of the bride tree and he looks back through the ages how the ages has been robbed of its leaves of worship the strength to come to the tree how the the beetles would eat eat it and and destroy the tree but he would not leave it with a destroyed tree he the scripture said i will restore saith the lord and brother branham was standing watching now let me just preface this he never spoke to a bride church like i'm preaching to now but he could see us coming [Applause] people that would enjoy the word as it was delivered he longed to see you but by vision he did [Applause] now i want you to understand when he tells the vision of the bride coming and he saw the the the nations and their their worldly church and their worldly garb and he said they were dancing to a tune of a beat and and they had like a fig leaf on them brother branham stood in her as god is showing them this vision and he begins to apologize and feel ashamed is this what i produced is this what i produced and then the angel tells him the pride will come back in view again and then he sees us from every nation from every nation he sees us gather and here we are all dressed hallelujah we've been dressed by this message we were thrilled to put it on hallelujah the dress where of malachi 4 5 and 6. ephesians 4 the fifo ministry we would have patience to allow ourselves to be watched purged repent and being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then being filled with the holy ghost and then we could stand as an invincible army and a message that could that could give us the foundations and build us now let me just say this to many times we're thinking that we've got to go back it's not going back it's going forward we're going forward well well we're going back to pentecost no we're going forward to pentecost hallelujah hallelujah don't you love him any good to us our challenge as the bride of jesus christ is finishing our challenge is finishing it when brother branham was standing there and he watched them as they walked before and he just he expresses how thrilled that he was to see the bride of christ and then one kind of at the end kind of stumbles a little bit and he begins to scream stay in line stay in line stay in line let me let me just say many times he would scream out whatever you do don't miss it then he you know he's getting up in in the years there in his 50s and he begins to call himself an old man at 50. a lot of miles on his odometer has his hands behind his head and he's kind of thinking some real deep thoughts and in just a moment he's looking down at his body and then he's standing amongst the millions of people the angel's with him and he's seeing them and who are these people they're your converts they're your converts and a woman walks up and hugs him and he notices immediately there's no human feelings he notices immediately what around what a round no human feelings and and the angel asked her asked brother branham do you know her and he said no i don't believe i do and he said you led her to the lord in her 90s restored restored a couple of years ago i spoke to you as an audience and i spoke it at brother tim pruitt's and these were the scriptures that that i used many believe that this is the sermon that caused satan to be so upset in first samuel chapter 30 and verse 1 forgive me it came to pass when david was and his men were come to zig lad on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziglag and smit and smitten ziglag and burned it with fire and had taken women captives that were therein and they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way and so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire with their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives and then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no power to weep and david's two wives were taken and i'm not going to try to say the first one the second was abigail until they the wife of nabal and david was greatly distressed [Music] for the people spake of stoning him because of the soul of the people was greed and every man for his sons for his daughters but notice these next words but david encouraged himself in the lord his god [Music] are you with me when everything turns against you and it looks like the enemy has taken everything that you've got god's not finished with the plan though you're walking through some of the darkest shadows of your life don't look at it with your physical eyes you keep your focus on the plan of god come on church [Applause] come on church and david stood there and his men's even speaking about stoning him men that would fight for him and give their life for him but now they're so in grief until they're willing to stone their king but he encouraged himself of the lord david said unto abathur the priest of of amalie's son i prayed bring hither the ephod and abbathar brought the the ephod of david and david inquired at the lord saying shall i pursue. after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered i love god's answer pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all [Applause] i want you to read that last words with me that god said pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all i want you to understand what you are watching is two years ago i felt led to preach this sermon not knowing what was coming my way but the amalekites they're known to sneak in behind and steal everything you got but i want to put him on notice tonight we have pursued we have overtaken and we will recover it all hallelujah brother tim if you're watching tonight or next week i want you to say these words pursue for thou shall surely overtake them and without faith recover and all without fail recover it all god's not done he's still got work for us to do now watch how jesus goes to a woman at the well i want to read one scripture here john chapter 4 and verse 10. jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou would us have asked of him and he would have given thee living water five husbands and the one you're living with is not your husband satan had tried to destroy her life with all kind of natural desires but i want you to see god looks way beyond the human element he looks way beyond your choices and your failures he looks way beyond your memory book of your life where satan beats you and scars you and he's a brutal taskmaster he'll scar your mind he'll scar you he'll make you live a life of regrets he'll make you live a life of sorrows he'll make you may live a life of wishing and the what ifs the choices in life took you somewhere on your road i made a choice for god let me just say this to you none of us was looking for god god was looking for us god came looking for you he came looking for adam he came looking for jacob he came looking for mary he came looking for you [Applause] he found you in a lot of different conditions i cannot imagine the waste of the accumulated days of the wasted days the peoples lost in their lives days on temporary things that's really not real anything that is temporary is not real never get your eyes or your focus on temporary things as a christian who we were and who we are is two different people i want that to settle in as a christian who we were and who we are is two complete different people now it looks like the same house it sounds like the same house but the old man came out and the new man came in and there was a seed that was always there we never was a hog we were always a sheep [Applause] come on church we always were god's seed our conditions was miserable and we were slaves to a lot of things but i want to remind you tonight once you're free you never have to go back to slavery no more [Applause] we hear the slaves singing songs those songs would be about getting free most of their songs was about getting free and amongst even the songs become a code they would sing songs like down by the river and they'd sing it all day long down by the river and the reason they were singing that song is if you want to go free there's going to be a freedom train down by the river tonight in the middle of the night if you can get to the river you don't have to be a slave tomorrow hallelujah there ought to be a code words in our songs tonight there is going to be a meeting in the air in the sweet sweet by and by and i'm going to meet you meet you there hallelujah [Applause] brother branham so appropriately spoke a sermon called as an eagle stir at this nest here in harrisonburg and he describes an eagle's cycle of life and how he has to stir the nest it was so here as well as around the world god had to shake our denominational nest and make eagles uncomfortable to get out of those nests and sail in the skies where you could have dominion and see yourself in a in a blood that you can walk out of never to go back ever again i think seeing a vision of yourself restored is very important so many times our vision shows us what we was why don't you just ask the holy ghost to change your vision i'm preaching to you now vision of being restored you came out of the book the lamb's book of life you're going back to where god called you to be in the original it's kind of like israel in this generation they were called to go back with nothing on their back basically they were called to go back to their homeland we've been called to go back to our homeland [Music] maybe your wings have got dusty maybe your eyes has got filmed over i think it's time to get yourself to the rock and beat the crust off of the eyes maybe time to have an old-fashioned prayer made in your home where you and god have a conference where it's way beyond emotion and way beyond feelings way beyond i'm sorry but where you and god can you come to a spot to where you die to yourself and god himself christ's the mystery comes and reveals himself in you because you are the mystery revealed paul would say it like this forgetting those things which are in the past don't dig them up so many times we focus ourselves on temporary situations that are not real anything that is eternal is real but anything that is temporary is really not real but brother ron i've been through some hard times and it felt so real yep but it wasn't eternal i've been through some bad sicknesses and it felt really real but it wasn't eternal [Music] it wasn't eternal god had you chartered on this month and he's watched over your life and there's been a lot of temporary situations that came through your life hang on to that which is eternal it's hard to us to focus and see a 2 000 year old graveyard that one day people will walk out of in a well perfect body bodies that have went back to the gases and ashes maybe burn at the stake or drowned at the sea wind the season no man can produce a rapture no man can produce a resurrection but we can live in an atmosphere of a revelation that when it happens it can't happen without us hallelujah i was sitting there i think i'd be shouting but it's all right the prophet of god said what if god would have told john the revel later it's going to be 2 000 years before my coming john would have come back and told the church well i guess we may as well eat drink and be married because we're going to have so many generations jesus is not coming for 2000 years you see the church would have been so loose there have been have would have been no on the mark and that's a term in horse racing for a horse to be ready and the rider to have his whip cracked just at the right moment he's not doing it just just to be doing it but that that horse is trained when that whip cracks it's time to give it everything that you've got little bride i want to say this to you it's time it's our time give it everything that you've got go hold nothing back give it all god preserves the seed [Music] when you can't watch over yourself he's preserving you he's watching over that life that life seat listen to him in luke 22 and verse 31 this is going to be the spokesman of the church on the day of pentecost and the lord said simon simon [Music] satan had desired to have you you put your name in there that he might sift you as wheat notice these next words are so powerful but i have prayed for you on the days you feel so alone jesus has prayed for you not your pastor not your best friend but god himself he's not leaving this up to a fickle man he is determined to see this through [Applause] and ev this rapture will be universal but it will be individual two in the bed two in the field two with them wanna be taken one of you left one in virginia i'm going to be that one [Applause] come on church we got to be determined i'm not watching man i'm not watching politics i got my eyes on this word and this word is bringing me into perfection watch how paul writes it hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8 that's all right by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob doesn't even mention esau i just spoke to you about temporary and what's real the way you look at humanity is a whole lot different than where god looks at it i know that's breathtaking but god didn't even look at esau but he was a better man naturally than jacob was oh but this person is so great brother ron and this one's so great it don't matter how we look at it this doesn't matter how you look at it there's people that no doubt can speak much better than i can they're much more handsome they carry themselves much more better than but god looked at me and he looked at you and he bypassed a million to get to you you talk about grace i don't need another sermon i just say god thank you okay let me just put it in a little better perspective if you can't get it washington is probably the one of the most one of the most civilized or populated cities that we have in america say something pretty difficult right here but god's not paying attention to none of them there's a couple groups of people there that assembled themselves and in god's mind mike walls is more important to god than the president of the united states america come on i'm going to preach to you now i want to tell you what you've been restored to brother on your way out on your thoughts am i heavens and earth will pass away so when it burns with a fervent heat mic walls and congregation will still be eternal [Applause] i lost my place [Music] still in the human body you know notice these words for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god now the reason he could look for a city whose builder and maker is god is he met the king now abraham met the king at 100 years old brother meadows is 90. we just celebrated his birthday 10 years from now brother medicine's going to start another family just ask sister sharon later just ask her later [Applause] and just as funny as it is in this building god told abraham he's going to have a son and he looked at it as total impossibility but he was with the king of an eternal land and god saw his lineage that had to come through through the lamb's book had to come on the earth and he was speaking with a man i can do the impossible [Music] but i'm not going to leave you like that to do it [Applause] that's what god has done with this message i'm not going to leave you as a church i'm not going to leave you as a denomination i'm not going to make you i suggest another group of people hallelujah i'm gonna restore you i'm gonna restore you and bring you back to your original that's what i'm going to do imagine being abraham's neighbor he's set with a stick and he's told these stories for years and you've heard them you know sometimes as we get older we repeat the same thing we've said over and over some of you get it today some of you get tomorrow some of you are not not laughing because your parents are sitting right next to you you've heard that story 61 times and sometimes in the middle of the story you just start telling what the end is so you can get there and abraham was repeating the story over and over and over oh yeah probably didn't keep his hair real well his clothes were old you know when you get older you wear the same thing you don't know where you washed it or not you smell it if it passes the smell test you put that baby on no doubt for the last year he has told in that condition i met a king i met a king then circumstances come along and he's got to move and he he's forced to move and he goes toward grill somewhere in the journey same neighbors if we can just come along with this you just come along with my folly just for a moment the same neighbors are watching him day after day and one day he walks out [Applause] [Music] he walks out in the body that could take care of the word that could bring forth the promise because the king of the promise had set in his tent and it wasn't just for abraham but it was also for sarah she had to catch the revelation for herself and see herself in the promise it's not just for preachers sarah's got to catch the revelation for herself am chief the bride of the last [Applause] day neighbors walked back in said mama we got new neighbors old people lived there like yesterday new people just walked out of they must have company it's going to happen here in elkton it's going to happen in grotto's let me just tell you a little bit about your future because you have been restored the rapture's been going on for quite a while it's been catching you up in a heavenly atmosphere you've been believing that you're a part of it [Applause] and all of a sudden you begin to talk about resurrected saints and talking about seeing your life once your neighbors are going to witness a change going on at your house brother on but it takes a while sometimes i i understand i understand i understand how we lose our patience patience is probably one of the things that most men never stood in line for i expected at least 130 amens from the sisters i'm going to say it again just to make sure you're not dead out there i know what some of you are thinking now don't get carnal god's not going to turn you back young again for y'all to have a bunch of babies here he's going to turn you back young again so we can take a rapture i do understand how that sometimes in our patients we we sometimes think well we've been believing this for a long time now some of you were young christians when i first came here about 20 21 22 years ago you were young christians you grew up with me and as as as as a pastor to you and and then some of you are getting gray-headed but listen i can't i i can't make the rapture happen i'm right with you i'm believing for it i'm preaching for it like it's going to be tomorrow could be tonight before we get home some have died in faith they didn't give up they didn't they wasn't doubters they wasn't sinners when they went to their graves they stepped from this room to that realm believers here believe us there [Applause] was they imperfect because they had to go by the way of the grave no god's blood made them perfect so they stepped from this rim to that realm you know imagine sarah has to wait till she's 90. listen to the promise imagine job that sat on an ash sheep the place where he gave sacrifices unto god it was that place that he felt comfort and and he rubbed he rubbed those those those balls on his back and on his body it was not an overnight experience the cancers that are leaving my body they begin to come up in my head you watch me itch my head sometimes and and and and they just come up all over me because they're they're trying to get out i got a big one on my leg right now it's trying to get out they're trying to get out they got to leave because the raps are going to happen this body is going to change and he ain't he taking cancer with it and by the way i ain't looking for a hole in the ground i'm looking for a chariot to take me in the sky it's a man talking right there could have more children i have people call me and say well brother ron why is this cancer done why ain't it gone you're a believer hey listen if it was up to me it'd have been gone day one i got enough atomic power laying in front of me tonight to blow him back to smithereens so god's got a purpose in all of this and i don't know how many cancer demons that we're destroying as we're going but god healed me a calvary and when he took those stripes at paula's judgment hall he was defeating those demons i don't care what you've got to go through in your life god's already whipped your enemy it's defeated shadrach meshach and abednego their names roll off of our lips just so quickly but there was a fourth man that was important in the fire and they did not know he was there until they got there i've said this before i'll say it again we've got a lot of men that want to fight a devil and they ain't never got no blood on their on their sword we got a lot of preachers they're like first lieutenants coming out of college they got a name tag but they ain't got no more authority or war experience than nothing [Applause] i want to hear a man that's been through some things in his life that can stand there and look the devil in the eyes and tell him you don't have enough you didn't bring enough and you ain't got enough god is on my side and he's proved he's on my side let me read to you about a man like that i said those statements to preface this in second timothy chapter 4 and just verse 1 i charge thee before god and for the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead and not his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke with all longsuffering and doctrine for the time will come we are there when they shall not endure sound doctrine they want a bible to their own choosing they want a church to their own choosing they wanted jesus to their own likeness come on i want people that's that's powerful in the word of god they don't have to bathe them around and they're not a bunch of hotbed plants we're going to go through some seasons in our lives we're going to go through some dry times springtime some winter times we're going to go through some difficult hours but we keep getting back up every day we'll never go back in our lives i'm not going to go back because that that pastor ain't shook my hand well for those that's been here in the last two years i apologize i'm not trying to avoid you i'm trying to stay well [Music] i just went to saskatoon and the deacons ushered me in and they ushered me out i waved and smiled from the pulpit there will come a day where we can sit down by the river watch the flow goes by we'll never age at that spot we can talk it all over there but until then my heart will go on singing [Music] for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap to themselves teach us having itchiness come on anybody can take this message that has any ability at all to speak can stand up and preach the word and put everything just exactly right and cause you to love him live any way you want to sitting in the pew but you need a god call man yeah i'm not just talking to here i'm talking a lot of places you need a god-called pastor that was ordained of god to see you through a man with the holy ghost that will cause sin out [Applause] and will fight for you and fight for your children and your children's [Applause] children you need a church that's not run by deacon boards trustee boards and a puppet pastor [Applause] many churches have to vote for weeks and months on buying chairs lawnmowers tractors i'm getting ready to spend about forty thousand dollars on a new piano and i ain't ask a person because i think we need it that keeps getting out of two and we got the best pianist in the world why did i think you needed those seats because i had a little while to preach to you and those seats are more comfortable than the mother's seats well i'm not bringing it up for a vote or an opinion tonight i'm just telling you that's where it is come on church didn't ask you for an extra dime god is prepared he'll take care of this church because i want to tell you i want to tell you something there's something real that's going on here god kept dealing with me to get these these seats because we needed more seating and now he's going to put people in those seats so let the critics reach let them hire and scream god always has a plan oh [Music] ain't it good ain't it good i'm gonna have to finish this at another time but they think that's good it's really good i want you to remember when you look over one another never take it for granted that this is the way that it always was it's kind of like two deacons that i met many many many years ago and i thought they were incredible men i just loved them both absolutely loved them both they came into office this is when i was a young man had red hair like another fellow here the pastor was sitting across the he said how you like those guys i said man they're awesome guys he said you ought to have been here when they first started out he said you see both of them made threats that they were going to kill each other and he said one was on the run and the other was chasing him and he chased him right into billy andrews church and both of them sit side by side so they wouldn't get away and both of them had enough conviction don't kill them in church and billy andrews preached and he preached convictions so straight and strong until both of those guys carrying guns i'm not going to ask how many guns is in this building tonight came running to the altar and give their heart to the lord bitter enemies in one service became best friends [Applause] don't tell me what you was cause that's not the important thing tell me who you are hallelujah the man writing these scriptures was a murderer he hated the church of jesus christ he was he was guilty of having stephen stoned but now he comes to the end of his ministry but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelists make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand notice these words not what i was but i know where i am i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all of them also that love his appearing now this is just this is just free this is just free the day before i went to canada i went for scans and when i came when the doctors came in they said you've got a blood clot in your lung quite large your right lung well if you look that up you don't take my word for it it's the number one killer amongst cancer patients [Music] and cancer is what produces blood clots i'm calling the devil out in the street right now you ain't watching gun smoke here and i'm not martial dealing much more powerful than marks are doing because what i'm shooting won't miss i won't need but one little rock you can cause strokes it can cause your heart to shut down cause a whole lot of things it can happen in a moment and dr gohan gave me some really good advice she sees the situation she knows we're doing we're getting ready to fly to canada connie asked her said is it all right for for him to fly to canada she said it's your life live it and she made some words like this she said live it to the fullest boudev 90 of the people would be under such fear right now they'd be afraid to get their heart rate up they dare wouldn't get on no treadmill walk two or three miles every day they take care of themselves but beings i have been restored it doesn't matter what the x-ray says come on church let's have church i want to finish it like i started let us lay aside every weight and the sin which that so easily beset you and run this race with patience we're not a bunch of walkers we're running we're giving it everything that we can give it don't cry for me when i'm gone cause i ain't ending this thing on no sad notes we cannot be defeated you see we have been restored

airport and there said a 1968 shelby and it's going to be up for auction in arizona nope i'm not bidding on this kind starting bid 200 000. you see this isn't this isn't remade [Music] it hadn't seen
