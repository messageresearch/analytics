this service we commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen if you have your Bibles today we' like to look over in the Book of Genesis chapter 15 also Genesis chapter 17 and man want to make mention we're so happy to have brother Randall Griffith his grandmother here from Canada we just want to welcome you and make you make you feel welcome I know you're I know I know you're so proud of brother Randall and and your sons there so we just we make you welcome here this morning God richly bless you amen Isn't Our Lord Jesus so wonderful he's so lovely to us amen Genesis chapter 15 and verse one after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram if you remember that you'll remember that just on the other side side of the page that you'll remember that there is where Abram went and brought back lot and and there he sat down with MDC and MDC he gave tithes and offered up to mzc there but he says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram it's always amazing that after the event of his presence that there the Lord begins to speak to him saying in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and ABR said Lord God what will thou give me see and I go childless and the steward of my house is Elie is this elaser of Damascus and Abram said behold to me behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thine Heir and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and he counted it unto him for righteousness also Genesis chapter 17 and verse one and when Abram was 99 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God ain't that just beautiful I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shal sh be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord I would like to speak to you today on a thought of I am your portion I am your portion and we we'd like to just look at that that today that he is the alls sufficient one the Almighty El shouldi he is he is the breasted God the almighty one and we we look at this word in the English portion it means a part of a thing separated from it a part though actually may not be divided but it's considered by itself it is a part assigned in an allotment or a dividend it's a portion of it it's just like when Jesus is standing there right before his Ascension and he says behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tar ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high what was it is that Jesus was getting ready to pay forward the dividends as as the bank of Heaven he was getting ready to pour out so we recognize that there was a promise that was over top of the children of God that was sitting there and we know this that A promise is a revelation of intention so if God if God promises something it is a revelation to us that God is intending to do something and we see and understand that under the Covenant that God had made with Abraham and his seed that his seed was going to have an inheritance in a land that was promised to Abraham even though Abram Abraham would never walk in that land but it was promised to his seed that he would walk in that land and there we recognize by the scriptures that Moses was born to bring them out of Egypt and it was Joshua's commission to bring them in and to divide the inheritance or the portion of the land in which they were allotted to be a part of and we know this that that that when God allots something to us there's nothing that can stand in our place or there's nothing that can take our position or the portion of what God has intended for our for our life and we know this that when you begin to study out the Book of Joshua that you'll find that we are even now today under a Joshua commission that we recognize that under Moses it was his it was his leadership it was it was his ministry to bring them out but it was Joshua's Ministry to bring them into the promised land and to divide the portion of the inheritance to each and every one of them and if you want to go and study that out you'll just go study Joshua chapter 13 where Joshua lays out all the borders of each tribe where they are to be parted and even the other two that were on the back side of the of the other side of the of the sea or the river of Jordan there but we understand that every single one of those when they begin to get and and the distribution of their portion it was exactly how God lined it out it was exactly by the law it was by the line it was by the measure so that every tribe had a proper portion according to his inheritance so we know this that when when God lays out an inheritance for his children it's measured out for them so I want you to know that today that you have been given an opportunity to receive of a measure of the Lord that has been GR it to the body of Jesus Christ and if you look at Psalm 78 and 54 that the Bible says here that he brought them to the border of his Sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased verse 55 that he cast out the Heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line an inheritance by line and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents so God is very specific about his children receiving their promise according as he has lined it out notice in Numbers chapter 18 that we find 18 and 20 that you'll find that God when he lays out you can study out the Book of Leviticus you can study out the book of numbers and you'll find that the Levites in verse 20 it said that the Lord spake unto Abram Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shall have thou any part among them but I am thy part and I am thine inheritance amongst the children of Israel so you find that God was the Levites portion so we so we recognize that even though they didn't have a portion in the land but God was their portion ain't it wonderful to know that today that God has made us Kings and Priests that we are sitting here today under the authority of God's word that God have said in Revelations 5:10 that I have made you notice you didn't make yourself this he said I have made you I have made you Kings and Priests and he says he goes on to say that then in Numbers Chapter 3 and 12 and behold I have taken the Levites from amongst the children of Israel instead of the firstborn that opened the Matrix amongst the children of Israel therefore the Levites shall be mine and even though the Levites may have not had a portion of land they had the greatest portion that there ever could be because land could be fought for and land could be stolen but the portion of the Levites could never be taken away from from them and I want you to know that God is very clear upon this that's why he says it over and over again that you are Kings and you are priest again in Deuteronomy chapter 32 and8 it said that when the most high divided to the Nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of Adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel verse 9 it says for the Lord's portion is his people Jacob is the lot of his inheritance so today I want you to Pat yourself on the back and so I want you to recognize that you're not just anybody you're the Lord's portion I don't know if you understand what I'm saying to you just at this moment the god that created the moons and the stars the one that told Abraham that I will make thy seed look up there in the stars and see if you can number them I am the god that created all of them and God is saying I am your portion and you are my portion do you recognize that today that you are fulfilling your position as the part of the body of Jesus Christ a voice of many Waters the last runners in this generation that we are sounding for every messenger throughout all the Seven Ages we are under the culmination of all these things and we are carrying our portion and this bride of Jesus Christ she is not hindered she is running her race she this this what is happening is a culmination of every voice and there is no excuse that is holding the body back because election is greater than your excuse his choice for you is greater than your mistakes your choice man's choice but his choice is greater than you greater than your choice so let me say it like this your this message chose you and there is nothing other than the influence of the heavenly host that is causing the bride to realize that this is her person this is her portion that this is her purpose to fulfill the last race that's what brother Brandon would say in Jehovah Gyra he would say to believe the word is to receive the word and to let it become life it's not something that we have left off or we've left it off for another day or try to put it off onto somebody else but to believe the word is to receive the word and let it become life you see but the individual and God has become the Same Spirit God's purpose in the beginning that Adam and Eve Was the Same Spirit Eve was she was bone of his bone she was life of his life she was flesh of his flesh every action that Eve made was a mimic of what Adam had made that's why you can look at this body of Jesus Christ and you can see none other than our Lord Jesus Christ operating through the bride's body why because she is under the same fulfillment of John chapter 14 and 12 that the works that I do shall you do also so think it not strange when you take these works when you take this life when you take this power and you see the manifestation of your portion coming to pass why because you are under the greatest Commission because the modern Church cannot fulfill this commission they can't run this race because they've not received an end time message like you have received but you are sitting here the borders have been lined out the borders have been lined out everything is in its order everything is in its place and things are lined out exactly where they need to be that's why William Brandon when he comes and he preaches the Feast of the trumpets he comes in there and he lines out all the borders so that the Bri of Jesus Christ no longer has to guess at who she is no longer has to worry about who she is but she's there under her commission and when Joshua was in his commission Joshua had an Angelic Covenant he had an Angelic event that took place in his life where MDC came and talked to him and said don't be afraid as a was with Moses so I will be with you so I will be with you don't you recognize the same voice that was speaking to William Brandon that spoke to him don't you fear to go anywhere or do anything for the never failing presence of Jesus Christ is with you always that that was not just a voice for William brandham that's a voice for our little children you don't have to be afraid you don't have to fear where you're going you are under a commission by an Angel under the seventh Angel's message don't you fear to go anywhere don't you fear to touch anything Hallelujah and when Joshua knew who he was standing with and who was standing with him he was not fighting his battles all by himself it was the Lord that was fighting his battles that's why Joshua could stand there when the sun was looking him at his in his face and it was going down that Joshua brought it back in his right position because he recognized it was his portion he had the ability as a Son of God to look to the son and speak to the son and say son stand still what was it Joshua was operating by the absolute that he had he believed in his absolute he believed in his absolute and brother randam said that sometime when you take an absolute an absolute will lead you to a paradox and when you tie your soul to this message it'll lead you to a paradox I know the world calls you crazy and the world calls you an oddball but it's okay it's okay what you are tied to will lead you to a paradox I know that it may seem strange that that we have marriages that have lasted over 60 years amongst our ranks and they've been perfected it's because it's because this absolute has led them to a paradox I know it's I know it might seem strange to you that little bitty 16y old girls can believe this message and live real holy life I know it's strange to to a lot of the world it's our absolute that we're tied to and we it'll produce the Paradox I know it might be strange for you young boys to live a real overcoming life in front of the world and they may understand why you do like you do it's because you're tied to your absolute and your absolute will produce a paradox this ain't just about speaking squirrels into existence this ain't just about speaking storms out of existence it's talking about living an overcoming life the reason why you can press the battle so hard is because you're tied to an absolute and you are tied to that absolute and it will produce the miraculous what is it what was it what was there in God's mind has now been revealed has been revealed to this body to think that there you were all the time in God's mind before there was a molecule that was ever formed or an atom that was ever spoken into existence you were there in God's mind to think that you could go back millions and millions and millions of years before clinkers were ever spoke into existence and the almighty God would roll them off of his fingertips that you were there in the back part of his mind this whole event that you see as the earth and the cosmos is do so that his body could come forth in this hour why because you are his portion if you don't hear anything else I say today hear this yes you are God's portion you are God's portion but he is your portion Hallelujah you see when God once reveals it you receive it as your property you see if it's if he begins to reveal the secrets of the heart what is he doing he's revealing his mind you so we see when we begin to see the very Supernatural come amongst the body of Believers and we see the supernatural begin to whether it's however it comes in miraculous healings or or demonstrations it's the very mind of Christ that's what William Brandon would say in the seven seal that the Supernatural is the mind of Christ and when the supernatural begins to take place and hearts are being discerned and secrets are being revealed you could say it that like like Amazon texts you a package that it has been delivered when God begins to discern the very secrets of your heart the package has been delivered the things that you ask and the things that you get are according to the revelation of his mind now a lot of people can't understand the package a lot of people can't understand what is going on here but this is something that only an elect group can understand what is it it's the language of a dynamic people that believe that they have the ability to go out there and create themselves an own world and live on it that's an amazing thing to do create yourself an own own world and go out there and live a private life on it you have the ability to speak a world into existence and go out there and live in it what are you doing brother Angel I'm telling you that by Your Atmosphere you have the abilities to speak a world into existence ain't it amazing when you're sitting there and your boss has done chewed you out and you have the ability to go create yourself your own little atmosphere create your own little world and go out there and live on it just for a few minutes till you get your emotions back in check I'd say that sometimes in your life you need to create some of those worlds go live on them maybe when your wife makes you mad maybe why when your husband makes you angry when he didn't put up his clothes when he done told him three or four times go out there and create yourself a old world and go live on at one time it's an amazing thing that the ability that the Sons and Daughters of God have that they can go out there and create a world and go live in it but brother random said whatever the Lord leads your soul to believe you can have it now he's not going to lead you to believe something crazy or something that's fanatical or outside of the Realms of his word but whatever he leads your soul to believe go ahead it's yours every place that The Souls of your foot Shall Set upon by faith God gives it to you Hallelujah he is your portion he was David's portion David was very clear when he was talking to saw when there was a Goliath a giant down there and he was defying the armies of the Living God J David was standing there and saying the Lord is my portion the Lord deliver me out of the Paw of a bear the Lord deliver me out of the Paw of a Lon notice what David was doing he was putting the accounts of the battle back on the one that the victory came from and when you can turn around and say that your portion that you are receiving came from the Lord that the victories that are on their Road are coming from the Lord you don't understand what's breaking forth in this place Visions are breaking forth Visions are breaking forth and there are people that are breaking forth into Victory I want you to know you don't have to live outside of your Victory this morning you don't have to live outside of your god-given privileges this morning you have every right to walk in there as the portion of the body of Jesus Christ and go out there and accept your Victory this morning there's going to be somebody that believes that the victory that is in the room is for them there's going to be somebody that believes that the manifestation of the gifts of the Holy Ghost is for them this morning I know it's a little far reached but it ain't that far from you remember it's just that close that other world's that close your Victory is in the room your Victory is in the room but we are living in an age where men look so close like the reality that's exactly what Jesus would say he would tell us in Matthew 24 that it would be so close close in the last day that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible is that right if if it was possible and brother random said that people can live so close to it he said they can live a life where they don't drink they don't go out and they don't go out and gamble they don't go out and lie they don't go out and do all kinds of adulatory Acts he said but they still not be with it he said but this is the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ so you you can live close to it you can be close to it but it's still not be the overcoming life actually it's really dangerous it's more dangerous for those that sat there and look at it and never accepted then for those that are are the real reality but this is the age of the personal life of Jesus Christ I know that a lot of times when when you get to preaching about that having the real thing that it makes you begin to squirm and it's not just about being a believer in Jesus Christ coming and dying on the cross it's about having the very life life and the attributes of the father living in the [Music] body now no no I know we done further down the road and that we're not going to receive a reward of of just just Pentecostalism we are going to receive the very reward of the person of life itself now let me tell you if if we've spent all of our time and just preaching this message and all it does is produce a greater a greater Baptist Church or a greater Assemblies of God Church than we are wasting our times but if we are producing the same life the same power the same Miracles the same works the same actions is there anybody going to help me Preach Today if we are producing what Jesus was producing then it's got to be full proof that we are the full body under the full headship let me tell you this was not William brandom's doing this is God's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes this is not brother Homer's doing this is not brother Ron's doing this is the Lord's doing if man could have done it man would have done it a long time ago and man would have done went into a Rapture but this is the final age a final People final Believers Hallelujah notice notice what the Bible says in Revelations 2: 7 that to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise so we recognize that this future reward is for all Overcomers throughout all the ages that this was the portion and shall be the portion of the Overcomer is the tree of life you can search out the Bible and you can see the Tree of Life all the way from Genesis to Revelation he was that one that was back there in the Garden of Eden he was the tree of life he was the author of life and and we know what the tree is it's a person so we understand that we are living in an hour of the personal life of Jesus Christ if he was there in the Garden of Eden as the tree of life he will surely be there in the paradise of God as the person of life he is your reward you ever went to a ball game ever went to a ball game and nobody gave you a trophy and you felt like you needed a trophy so you get yourself to make your own trophy thank you brother duck some of you get it today if you want to know ask brother Doug later but when you don't get the trophy that you deserved God said I am your reward I am your reward and it's easy to look out there on the rest of the world and see them how do people live any just a kind of a life and get by with it they're not getting by with it you look out there and say well them them people get by with it they get by with doing this they get by with doing that they're not getting by with it but I I don't care what what others do and I don't care what other other religions do as long as I please him because I'm not fully satisfied until he's satisfied and it's easily to it's easy to look out there on the rest of the world and see the rest of the world out there in Egypt prospering and you down there in Egypt building building bricks it's easy to get your eyes on the wrong thing and get your eyes on the blessings of Egypt instead of the promise of Israel it's so easy sometimes to look out there lay Osa and see them prospering they ain't living the kind of message that you're living they're not living the kind of Holiness that you're living but yet it seems like they're on top of the mountain all the time but God says I am your portion when William Brandon's out there in Oklahoma and he comes out of TL osbor or he comes out of ARL Roberts he comes out of his university and he looks at it and he sees all these IBM machines out there and he sees all these working hundreds of people working in that University he comes out brother R said he was sitting there and he said Satan started talking to me and he said God don't trust you he knew that if he give you these kind of elements that you'd fail him so he couldn't make you a rich man he couldn't give you all these things that or Roberts and TL osburn's got he said there I was and he said I started believing what he was talking to me and he said all of a sudden a voice came and said but look up I am your portion I am your portion little bride don't you get your eyes on the rest of the world don't you get your your eyes on politics don't you get your eyes on this that and the other get your eyes on your portion don't get your eyes on the circumstance don't get your eyes on the doctor's report get your eyes on your portion he is the almighty God he said I am your portion let me tell you if God is your portion you can let everything else in the world go by but As Long As I Got King Jesus as long as I got him I got everything that I have need of in old age I got his portion and young age I got his portion throughout my midlife crisis he is my portion he is my everything that's why the Bible said in Lamentations 3 and22 it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness the Lord is my portion sayith my soul therefore will I hope in him you see the almighty God is furnished with power to help his own people he is my portion notice notice if he's your portion if he's your portion he's your everything it shouldn't nothing hinder you from worshiping him you're right brother Jordan that was one of them clapping moments nothing should hinder you if he is the almighty in your life it doesn't matter how old you're getting it doesn't matter how wrinkled you're getting it doesn't matter how stoop shoulder you're getting there should nothing hinder you from worshiping him if he is your Almighty when the bank is empty he's still my portion when my health has run out he is still my portion when my friends have left me he is still my portion when friends walk away from me he is my portion when family leaves me he is is my portion when preachers turn their back on you he is your portion when your loved ones leave you he is your portion when the doctor is against you he is your portion when the enem is against you he is your portion when sickness is against you he is my portion so if he is your portion there should be nothing hinder you from worshiping the almighty Abraham I don't care what situation of life you're in he's still your portion it doesn't matter how old you getting he's still your portion he's still my portion let me tell you through the fire he was still the Spencer's portion through the lightning strike he was still the portion of our family he was still the portion when Homer Fraser fell out of a tree he was still our portion when our pastor got diagnosed with cancer our Lord was our portion come on somebody when you got a million dollars in the bank he still my portion when you got more than you have need of he still my [Applause] portion it doesn't matter what kind of car you drive it doesn't matter what kind of family you came from let him be your portion it don't matter if your last name Spencer brandom Reagan or whatever let God be your portion Hallelujah you're not going in just because you're under Ron Spencer's Ministry you're going in because you're his portion and if you are his portion it doesn't matter what comes against you it doesn't matter what's stacked up against you our God is not going to leave a part of himself down here in Lay osia Hallelujah David said in Psalms 16:5 the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and my cup thou maintain us my lot the lons are falling me unto me in Pleasant places you know God knows where to drop the measuring tape at and measure off a section of the holy spirit for you you see these so-called Baptists amongst the message church that can only get so so wide in their experience of the Holy Ghost it's because God knew that they wouldn't praise him outside of the box but God gave this portion God gave this lady God gave this Lady of Grace a measure of Grace a measure of Peace so she knew he knew what you would do with this when he gave it to you the lies Hallelujah there ain't nobody else measuring this out you forgive me I'm going to preach today there ain't nobody measuring off and there ain't nobody measuring out how much experience of the Holy Ghost that you can have the lines have falling unto me in Pleasant places there ain't no Baptist preacher there ain't no Church of Christ preacher that can tell me how much of the Holy Ghost I can have the Lions have fallen me in a great place God knew that you believ this message brother Jordan and before you ever got here God already draw out your [Applause] lines Hallelujah brother L he drew out your lines and it looked like he was an inheritant but God already drove it out the lines have fallen under me in Pleasant places God knows that your order of the Lord he knows that you're going to make the right [Applause] footsteps woo well bless the Lord the lons are falling under me in Pleasant places yay I have a goodly Heritage I know a lot of y'all like to enjoy looking through your DNA history look through your ancestry you're 23 and me and seeing where you came from it's pretty amazing thing that they could scope it out and say you came from the appalachi mountains you're 92% Norwegian some of you are 82% German but it's amazing that they can line out and they can show you where you came from you spent $100 to spend in a bottle and to send it off for somebody to tell you where you came from I could have told you that before you spent your $100 well I was really wanting to know where I really came from I know where I came from I came from the mind of God and I'm going back to the mind of God I have a goodly Heritage let me tell you God thought of me before Ron Spencer and constant Spencer ever thought about Andrew Spencer being here I have a goodly Heritage to think that that was wrote over 4,000 years ago but he was talking about you when your daddy leaves you and your mama walks away from you and the rest of the world don't want to believe like you believe you got a goodly Heritage David when your son absin turns against you you got a good goodly Heritage what are you talking about you're going to raise a Solomon and Solomon's going to build a temple it's going to be it's going to be an aspect of our future home Hallelujah you got a goodly Heritage the lions are falling under me under Pleasant places the Lord is the portion of my inheritance there a song We I think we used to sing it maybe used to sing it Long As I Got King Jesus Long As I Got King Jesus Long As I Got King Jesus I don't need nobody is he is the portion of M inher we going to have to work that one back in if you didn't sing it we're going to sing it that's how we do things up here just be ready after service just kidding we ain't working on that kind of inspiration today but the Lord is a portion of my inheritance so as long as you Got King Jesus all right as long as you got as long as the Lord is your portion and the inheritance of my cup when you look at that word that cup it means the man's life or his lot or his condition of life so look at Psalms 11 and6 notice the condition of the wicked upon the wicked he shall reain snares fire and brimstone and horrible Tempest this shall be the portion of their cup notice the wicked's condition but notice what David says about the believer's position that my cup runneth over and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life my conditions of Life are laid out by the Lord in specific spots that's why you can never be blessed outside of this [Music] message Hallelujah you tried everything you wanted to in life you tried to enjoy drinking you tried to enjoy living that kind of life it was pleasurable for a season but the lines didn't fall to you there the lines were roped off around the message let me say it to you like job said job you got a hedge of protection around you there's a fence around your borders what was it something on the inside of you was thirsting for the portion of life so you tried to satisfy that portion with filthy living with idolatry with drinking and smoking and some of it even wasn't that bad it was just putting yourself in front of the Lord you tried to satisfy yourself that way but until you got into your borders you know good and well I I I'll be honest I about to had myself a shouting fit last night I had to be honest with you about more than this these 16 elements could handle here last night watching those that said they had made a decision I'll never go back to that church no more I tell you what you begin to look at that crowd there some real generals and some real queens in that crowd and some real genuine filled Holy Ghost people in that crowd you see because they they made a they made a decision they made a decision in their mind I'm not going back to that church but there was a gene seed of God that wouldn't let wouldn't let them get outside of their borders I tell you what when you begin to think about how the grace of God Ran after you brother Jim and thought you was going to go your own way and thought you was going to go after your own election and after your own choice but God's election so fit that you would live inside of these walls let me tell you these walls ain't Prison Walls these walls are castle walls and if you look at it in the right aspect God is keeping you from everything out there and outside of the world this ain't laws of dos and don'ts it's a law of almighty God it's a life of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you didn't choose yourself you didn't make yourself believe this you tried with everything within your power to disbelieve it matter of fact most of us came to this message trying to prove it wrong brother Donnie Reagan said he said he said I was under my trinitarian Doctrine and he said the same scriptures I was using for my trinitarian Doctrine when the god revealed it he said I prove he said God proved it to me that I was in the wrong he said and I started using those same scriptures to prove this side of the Oneness of God what was it he had to get on the right side of the fence he had to get right on the right side where the lines had fallen under him you see if you can ever get to the spot where you recognize it ain't you you ain't got nothing to do with this I appreciate every one of our families here I appreciate the Fraser family I appreciate the breeding and the and the and the Meadows family and and the Fraser and the Spencers and all of them but this has nothing to do with that this has nothing to do with that we are a family here I don't care if your name's Martin I don't matter it don't matter if your name's quer it don't matter if your name's no hell it don't matter if your name's Damron this is the heritage of the most high God hallelujah hallelujah but when it come to Abraham's time of life when he was 99 years old the Lord appeared to him you go back and you study out them scriptures Genesis 14 Genesis 15 Genesis 16 and then you flip over to Genesis 17 you got to think one chapter before Hagar has been introduced to Abraham's Ministry and he's trying to produce a New Birth by his own Ministry but he can't do it but it's 13 years later when God speaks to him in Genesis chapter 17 ishmael's a teenager at this time and God is talking to Abraham you're still not too old for this you're still not too old you're still not too stoop shoulders you're still not because why I am l o him I am the almighty God I am the author of strength and of power I am El shed the almighty the most powerful I have spent some time this week going through going through the commentators and going through the theologians none of these none of these it's amazing it's amazing the incredible Revelation that William brandham had to tap into the revelation of elhad because all of those theologians disagreed or couldn't come up with the same idea on what elhad meant so it shows to us that elhad is a a powerful re Revelation that comes from almighty God and when God begins to declare himself by the name Eli he was showing to Abram when he was still in his insufficiency he was saying to Abram I am your strength you see Abram was insufficient to bring Isaac to into fruition but the name El Shi upon Abraham was showing that he was going to be the one that was undertaking for Abraham's behalf it was a solemn promise from the almighty God that eladi is the breast of God and there he appears to him in Genesis 17 as the almighty God when it looks like all hope was gone God says it ain't over till I say it's over he appears in the name of elad when you're 99 years old when you're running out a rope God thrs you you a l when you're running out of hope God gives you faith when you're running out of Destiny God gives you a revelation what is he doing he begins to declare himself as the breasted One what does it mean it means to draw strength out of the almighty God it's like a woman's breast when she's feeding that little baby what is she doing that baby does not know how to live but all he knows how to do is pull the very strength out of his mother that's why God gave you a two breasted book of the old and the New Testament so that when you don't feel strong enough he is your strength when you don't feel powerful enough you can say let the weak say I am when you don't feel like you're adequate enough he says I am your strength what is it he said I am your strength when your strength is all gone God stand before him and said I am El sh I am the breasted God so what was Abraham doing he was drawing his strength out of the strongest one that there ever has been now let me tell you this God ain't only just a lifegiver to Abraham but he was proving to him that I am your satisfier now you husbands know good and well you know good and well that you ain't got what that baby needs to satisfy but that Mama is equipped in such a way that she can satisfy that little baby there is something that she has built with in that way to produce what that baby needs and you know good and well in your own Humanity that you do not have the sufficiency to satisfy that longing heart that's why you've got to lean upon the breasted one and pull your strength out of it I know your joy might be gone but lean on the bosom of Abraham's Abraham's God of el Shad ey I know it seemed like you ain't had peace in a long time but why don't you lay on the bosom of el Shad I know you may feel like yeah you're not able to make it into the Rapture but why don't you lay on the bosom of el sh I know what I'm talking about I know what I'm talking about I had to go there I've had to lay on him I've had to I've had to lay on him I've had to talk to him I've had to have personal conversations with him I've had to I've had to have one of those walks with him God I'm not able to do this God I'm not able to overcome God I'm not able but when I lay my head upon the bosom of el High I find it's not by might and it's not by power but by my spirit sayth the Lord Abraham I know it looks like it's impossible but the one that is at your tent door he's the one you've been pulling on he's the strength he's the strength he says I am El sh and you are the leak weak little baby but lean up my bosom my promise and nurse for me your strength I am the creator of heavens and earth but the stars out of and put the stars out wonder is anything too great for God I am El Shad you are my child though you are weak I'm letting you get that way just to see what you'll do about it I'm letting you get that way just to see what you're going to do about it brother Joel I'm going to make an example for people Hereafter that that man will believe my word I'll stand by my word no matter what it takes how long I'll do it I'll stand by El sh draw your strength from me you're not my favorite preacher brother Andrew who cares it's who I represent I stand here in the stead of elhad and you don't understand what's going on right now but if you could draw your strength from the word of God you'll find out he's still El sh you'll find out he's still the breasted God you'll find out he's still new in Old Testament just draw your strength from it oh everything that you have need of the baby he is helpless he has to pull his strength from his mother that's the only way that he can get his strength that's the only way that a belie can get a strength is to pull it from the word of God that's his strength God's promises to him God stands by his word there is no insufficiencies in God it doesn't matter how far you've ran it doesn't matter how far you gone there is no insufficiencies of God it doesn't matter if you've criticized it I got a quote here to back up what I'm saying it doesn't matter if you've criticized it itn't matter of your condition God is elshad he is the breasted God that he is a life sustainer and he is a satisfier of Life brother Brandon was dealing with a patient one time he's dealing with a brother and he's dealing with him in sickness in his body he said there's a Warfare between your elet and between the spirit he said you see he said but if your spirit can come up to believe this so notice what that Elman had done it had depressed his Spirit but what did he do what was William brandham doing he was calling for that man's Spirit to come up here to believe it what does the preaching of the word do it calls for you to let your faith loose and let your spirit fly into a realm that maybe it seems incompass he said oh if your spirit can come up here to believe this God will bless you and you'll get well he said you're a Believer CU I believe that all my heart yes sir you haven't always been a Believer though you've been a Critic you criticized this haven't you isn't that right yes sir you criticized it I believe it was probably my meeting I see you shaking your head is he still Hebrews 4:12 I see you shaking your head but if you go to listening the brother turns and ask for forgiveness thank you he asked for forgiveness and the prophet said looks into that world you're forgiven my brother so you see you see the spirit of God was sufficient enough to heal him and he was sufficient enough to forgive him it doesn't matter if you sit in the seat of the scornful it doesn't matter where you've been sitting at my God is sufficient enough to satisfy every portion of your life and what did Abram do he nursed a new body out of elhad ey to produce the promise of Isaac what did that woman down there in Mexico that come walking through the water had a dead baby in her arms what did she do she nursed on El shad's breast and pulled aive baby right back out of it hallelujah what did Congressman Upshaw do he laid out there 66 years in the same condition but eladia was enough for congressman Upshaw and he pulled a new life out of it blind barus had sat there all them years but one day Jesus had walked that way before and he knew that he was sitting there he knew blind marus was sitting there but when he walked by there this time he wasn't going to leave it for his brothers his disciples to come in the book of Acts and do it but he was going to do the work what did he do he recognized that that was the same one that Joshua had talked to down there at the Gate of Jericho at and he pulled eyesight out of Jehovah what about Florence n andil sherle they paid for a ticket for William Brandon to come and pray for her but because of circumstances William brandham couldn't get to to her all the way over there from Duran South Africa super tall lady but cancer had got in her stomach so much that she was such a thin thing brother brand said when he saw her he said I don't even know how that she had the ability to produce tears said there wasn't even enough there wasn't even enough blood in her veins to be able to take blood from and when he met her in London at the airport they said she's here for this come pray for me but she wasn't praying for healing she was praying for him to die for her to die she had lived in such a wicked state of life being under the pressures of it you get to a spot sometimes you you you know that death is a friend and she was praying but brother Bram said when I went down there he said I went to pray for her and he said I wasn't praying for her to die he said I didn't know he said I didn't have no anointing on me he said I didn't know what was going to happen he said but while I was sitting there praying for her the dove of the Holy Ghost come and landed on that wiow se window seal and while he was praying that Dove CED back and forth and Vindicated what the healing was getting ready to take place what was this Florence what was she doing she was nursing from a body that was so sick that was incapable of being made whole what did she do she nursed the very strength out of eladia's life so what am I saying to you that the Lord our God is your shield and he is your buckler he is your portion he is your portion there is no more roaming there is no more wandering this is your land of the Holy Ghost Joshua little bride this is your portion this is your manifestation this is your Vindication this is your land that's why the Bible would say in Isaiah 54 that no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper and tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousnesses of me sayith the Lord so every weapon that is destined against you is destined to be destroyed he's the one that created the waser to destroy but he's got the power to protect you when the weapon that is formed against you comes against you and he said every tongue that rises against you Hannah every mocker every mocker Thou shalt condemn Abraham God has called you a father a a father of many nations let them mock you all they want to but every tongue that rises against you Thou shalt condemn the tongue that rises against you words have the ability to really slander against you words have the ability to hurt you the person who said sticks and stones may break my bones but words may never heard me never had real friends stab them in the back but let me put it to you like Spurgeon said it that the slander that strikes you you shall condemn it the more accusers the more acles the more slander the more honor the so the enemy May slander as much as much as he pleases but you're going to be there to condemn the slandering when the enemy says you ain't going to make it rise up and condemn it when he says you're not going to make the Rapture rise up and condemn it but notice this ain't just for any churchgoer this is for the heritage of the Servants of the Lord so this scripture is not just for the trinitarianism this is not just for the Baptist this is for God's portion God's elect God's qualified God's predestinated let me tell you this ain't a church this ain't a church scripture this is a bride scripture yeah somebody hold me down give me some ratchet straps I'm about to rock it out of this place this ain't just for anybody this ain't just for the pope this ain't just for Billy Graham when you see Billy Graham and you see orl Roberts and you see those great men tying into these scrap these scriptures and getting the blessings off of it what are they doing they're tying themselves in into your promises but the promise was not for them it was not for Ismael it's for you Isaac I am your portion so no weapon if it be cancer shall rise against you it shall not Prosper pornography sh shall not Prosper demonic spirits shall not Prosper old age shall not Prosper anxieties complexes hurts stigmas I know where I'm at I know where I'm at let them say what they going to say let them say what they going to say let them do what they going to do but as for me in my house I know where I'm at I'm I'm not reaching here but every tongue that rises against you little bride you have a job to do now this ain't me this ain't me this ain't my doing this ain't some workup of some man this ain't some workup of of emotions here but this is H this is himself this is not Abram this is Abraham so Abraham could not do it on his own Andrew Spencer could not do it on his own Ron Spencer could not do it on his own Hallelujah so God had to deposit a part of himself on the inside of Abraham to show that he was able to do it when God poured himself into Abraham they have laughed at you they have mocked you they have talked about you they've called you a Holy Roller they've called you it's just a bunch of workup but I didn't do that just so that they could talk about you I'd put myself on the inside of you to prove that their accusations was [Applause] false you that were here last night and you stood up with you mind standing up again these are those that said that they would never come back to this church they' made a declaration they weren't coming back but they wern't holding on themselves they weren doing it themselves God deposited a part of himself on the inside of them men talked about them men criticized them their own mind condemned them but God rich in Mercy Satan I want you to take a look keep standing Satan you take a look you did not have enough power to keep us in the prison sell you did not have enough power to keep us in our 99 year old body but when meel that came to my tent blessed be the name of the most high God Abraham it's not you it's me little bride this ain't a workup it's [Applause] me Abram I am your satisfying portion when you can't do this when you try to do it through every other thing brother brandom said that the new birth is your satisfying portion you can not live this message without the new birth hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Abraham he never pulled he never Fred he never worried he had the word and he laid upon El shad's breast you're not drinking from a fountain that's been froze over you got an artisian well that you're drinking from this ain't just on Saturday night and Sunday morning Hallelujah this ain't some painted fire this is a fire of the Holy Ghost this is the anointing of the mighty Angel himself Hallelujah there is no satisfying portion outside of this message there is no satisfying portion in the end of a bottle there is no satisfying portion outside of the new birth you ain't serving some dead god with he we got a Living God on our side I'm not 1900 years ago but the same Pillar of Fire that came down at the day of Pentecost that led the children of Israel that showed up at William bram's Ministry and I declare to you by the word of the Lord that same Pillar of Fire is in this room this morning what you cannot do Abraham I have deposited you can't do it you can't Manifest this Abram you're crazy you're a father of Nations and you can't even get out a Monday morning without being tempted that stupid devil right right right Satan was close but he wasn't that close sister Sue he was close but he wasn't that close Satan's only got power as long as you believe in his lie but when you refuse his lie you strip him of his power Satan was close and he heard what was promised to Abraham so he started mocking and he started making fun and he started raising up criticism against Abraham but it was not enough to stop the promise because what God had deposited brother Nathan was enough Hallelujah out of him would flow rivers of living water out of him would come Isaac but Isaac was not his Royal seed Christ was his
