[41:38] of of Johnny coming to the Lord
[41:41] and these last seed coming in
[41:44] brother Branham said uh
[41:46] he said he's talking about the world
[41:48] wars he said it stopped on the November
[41:50] the 11th which we have just experienced
[41:53] this week
[41:54] he said at 11 o'clock in the day an 11th
[41:57] month in the 11th day in the in the
[41:59] month in the 11th Hour in the day you
[42:02] remember what Jesus said about that one
[42:05] went into the in the vineyard to work at
[42:07] one time and one got a penny and the
[42:10] next one went and them was the 11th Hour
[42:14] people
[42:15] was
[42:17] was that right they
[42:20] there they are the 11th Hour people
[42:24] it's been held back now it's getting to
[42:28] a time for them to come in and they are
[42:31] gathering out there of those Jews for a
[42:34] nation
[42:35] they were scattered all over the world
[42:37] way down in Iran different places where
[42:41] they've never ever knowed that Jesus was
[42:44] on the earth never know nothing about a
[42:47] new testament or anything
[42:49] and now you can look and look magazine
[42:52] and life and them showing the pictures
[42:56] of them returning back
[42:59] didn't Jesus say it when you see the Fig
[43:01] Tree putting forth its buds Jews has
[43:05] always been the Fig Tree this generation
[43:08] shall not pass until all things be
[43:13] fulfilled
[43:14] God made the promise
[43:17] God will keep his promise I read this to
[43:20] you a couple of weeks ago and I want to
[43:22] just kind of pick up where I left off
[43:24] and take from last night
[43:27] and and it was quite a statement when I
[43:30] got it I've given God a million reasons
[43:34] not to love me
[43:37] and none of them changed his mind
[43:44] isn't that isn't that nice
[43:46] yeah isn't that nice
[43:48] amen if you'll turn with me to to
[43:51] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9.
[44:06] I want to speak to you on I find no
[44:09] falling in him
[44:11] and I want to talk to you a little bit
[44:12] about our flaws
[44:16] Matthew chapter 6 and verse 9.
[44:19] and after this manner therefore pray ye
[44:23] Our Father which art in heaven
[44:26] Hallowed be thy name
[44:28] thy kingdom come
[44:30] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[44:33] heaven
[44:34] give us this day our daily bread
[44:38] and forgive us our debts
[44:42] as we forgive our debtors what a
[44:46] statement
[44:48] forgive us our debts a man that would
[44:52] never have a sin in his life
[44:55] would pray would put this in his prayer
[44:58] and forgive us our debts

[45:32] supernatural way

[45:55] that lays just ahead speak to us in a
[45:58] special way we pray amen and amen and
[46:00] amen you can be seated
[46:09] brother Brandon would say it like this
[46:12] he said that's the way it is today
[46:15] we guilty unworthy
[46:19] should die
[46:20] we're not worthy of living
[46:23] we're not worthy to come to Christ
[46:27] we're not worthy to ask anything
[46:31] but God never looks at our unworthiness
[46:36] well yeah and that'll take us a deep
[46:38] breath he looks at the lamb
[46:40] and now he can't find no fault in Christ
[46:44] then you're free
[46:50] so why are you beating yourself up all
[46:52] the time
[46:55] now if he can't find no fault in Christ
[46:57] then you're free
[46:59] he died in your Stead
[47:04] now if there's any fault in him you're
[47:07] not free yet
[47:09] but God don't examine you
[47:12] he examines the lamb
[47:15] Give the Lord a good hand right there
[47:18] hey
[47:21] Hallelujah
[47:22] [Applause]
[47:25] in the New Testament no matter what's
[47:27] wrong with you
[47:29] don't you look at yourself
[47:32] look at your lamb
[47:34] can you find any fault in him
[47:38] God don't look at you
[47:40] he looks at your lamb
[47:42] so if there is no fault in the lamb then
[47:46] there's no fault in you
[47:52] Hallelujah are you getting it now huh
[47:57] we're not Catholics here
[48:00] and we're not a rehab house
[48:03] are you with me we're not a law
[48:06] Transformation Center we're transformed
[48:09] by the blood of Jesus Christ
[48:12] it's his lamb it's his life that he's
[48:16] poured back inside of us
[48:19] now he says any son it's the attributes
[48:22] of his father and just as you were the
[48:24] genes of your father in the body of your
[48:26] father when you was young and you were
[48:29] in him yet he could not have fellowship
[48:32] with you
[48:34] because he didn't know you
[48:38] but then through the betting ground of
[48:40] your mother
[48:42] you were brought forth into the Earth
[48:45] and become in the image of your father
[48:48] and then he could have fellowship with
[48:50] you
[48:52] and so were you sons of God and
[48:55] Daughters of God before there was ever a
[48:58] moon a star or a molecule
[49:03] oh
[49:05] you
[49:07] were the sons of God for you are only
[49:11] the physical manifestation of the
[49:15] attributes that were in God
[49:18] before the beginning
[49:23] Hallelujah for there's only one form of
[49:27] eternal life
[49:29] and that was you before
[49:32] you don't know nothing about it neither
[49:35] did you know when you were in your
[49:36] Earthly father
[49:38] but you were manifested in His image and
[49:42] in the image of God you are made and you
[49:45] were manifested for the glory and The
[49:48] Fellowship Of God and therefore as you
[49:51] as you as you are in the gene you had to
[49:56] be in your father before in your natural
[49:58] birth your your spiritual Gene had to be
[50:03] in God because you're the expression of
[50:07] the attributes of his thoughts before
[50:09] the foundations of the world right
[50:13] No Way Around It
[50:19] oh brother on I found God no no no no no
[50:22] God found you
[50:26] you wasn't thinking of God God came
[50:28] thinking of you
[50:30] he knew what day hour that you'd be born
[50:33] what messages you would be under
[50:36] you just didn't stagger into a mission
[50:38] house somewhere another and all of a
[50:40] sudden walk to an altar God ordained
[50:43] your life for the footsteps of the
[50:45] righteous or ordered of the Lord
[50:49] and if you can remember if God protected
[50:53] your natural seed for you to get here
[50:56] that you would be a certain hair color
[50:58] certain eye color a certain physical
[51:01] attributes
[51:03] even in your complexities even in your
[51:07] flaws
[51:11] God knew what you would be he knew what
[51:14] your weaknesses would be he knew what
[51:16] your flaws would be but he proprieted a
[51:20] lamb that would take care of your flaws
[51:23] all right
[51:31] if you'll remember brother random
[51:32] explains that he would try to explain it
[51:34] like a drop of ink
[51:37] if you could drop it into a drop into
[51:40] into bleach
[51:43] and and if you drop that drop of ink
[51:45] into bleach
[51:47] it will so break it up until it would
[51:50] become bleach itself
[51:54] and then he drops our sins into the
[51:57] blood of Jesus Christ
[52:00] now under the blood of the of the goats
[52:03] and and and bullets you you only covered
[52:07] the sin but under the blood of Jesus
[52:10] Christ
[52:12] it annihilated sin to the point
[52:16] the god that made the sun moon and stars
[52:19] would not ever remember that against you
[52:22] ever again
[52:24] [Applause]
[52:33] now brother random would make this
[52:34] statement and I think it's pivotal
[52:37] this drop of ink now
[52:39] it was for a purpose
[52:42] that color become that color for a
[52:46] purpose
[52:47] that one drop of ink
[52:50] now notice these next words
[52:53] that one drop of ink can sign your death
[52:57] warrant
[52:59] and sends you to an electric chair
[53:06] quite a statement in it
[53:09] or that one drop of ink can pardon you
[53:17] from your sins
[53:22] you heard me say this a couple of weeks
[53:25] ago
[53:26] for us Believers we're as close to hell
[53:29] as we'll ever be
[53:34] so don't let Satan torment you
[53:38] don't let Satan torment you
[53:41] just relax you're in the hands of God
[53:45] and God don't lose one he's not a
[53:47] businessman where he loses one so the
[53:51] accuser that gets in your ear
[53:55] I want to just give you the theme right
[53:57] up front the accuser that gets in your
[53:59] ear and reminds you of all the things
[54:01] that you used to do
[54:06] and the memories of all the things that
[54:08] you used to do you're not guilty of that
[54:11] no more
[54:12] [Music]
[54:13] [Applause]
[54:22] you're not guilty of that no more and it
[54:25] may seem so real and so vivid in your
[54:27] memory and so vivid in your conscience
[54:30] and it may so seem so so so real that
[54:33] it's so haunting you almost live in a
[54:36] haunted house but what if you just turn
[54:38] on the devil just a little bit and say
[54:40] God Justified me and it's as though I
[54:43] never did it in the first place
[54:45] [Applause]
[55:04] Fanny Crosby
[55:07] lived with a flaw in her DNA
[55:12] she was blind
[55:15] now I wanted to share this with you a
[55:18] flaw will either destroy you
[55:22] or it'll drive you
[55:27] and being blind
[55:29] never see in the light of day
[55:32] God had a gift in her life
[55:35] that she would write music and be one of
[55:38] the greatest writers that would ever be
[55:42] but she never let the flaw
[55:46] get in in the way of the gift
[55:51] Moses would be one of the writers
[55:54] of the Old Testament
[55:56] but there was things that he had to
[55:59] write about himself
[56:00] that were flaws in his life murderer
[56:06] temper
[56:08] striking the rock twice
[56:14] are you with me and if God knows you
[56:17] before in the beginning
[56:20] before there was ever a molecule that
[56:23] was created
[56:24] and he knows you as Eternal and he knows
[56:28] that you're going to come on the earth
[56:29] in a fallen nature I'm going to preach
[56:32] to you
[56:33] he knows you're going to come in a
[56:35] fallen nature and he knows your faults
[56:37] and he knows your fears and he knows the
[56:40] flaws in your life
[56:42] God rich in Mercy provides a way to get
[56:46] you through all of those flaws
[56:55] Moses
[56:57] when he comes to the end he stands on
[57:00] the mountain weeping because he's not
[57:02] going to get to go through into the
[57:04] Promised Land
[57:06] and God allows him to look over the
[57:08] mountain
[57:10] an angel pallbearers takes him home
[57:14] but the devil had a railing accusation
[57:17] in Jude had a railing accusation against
[57:21] Moses The Sinner
[57:25] but God overrode his thoughts
[57:31] and would not let Satan have his body
[57:36] and sent angel pallbearers to Bear him
[57:40] home
[57:41] and then the next time he's seen he's
[57:44] seen on the Mount of transformation with
[57:47] Jesus
[57:58] Hallelujah
[58:04] pilate is standing before Jesus
[58:09] and pilate saith unto him
[58:13] what is truth
[58:17] and when he had said this
[58:20] he went again unto the Jews
[58:24] and saith unto them
[58:29] I find
[58:30] in him
[58:32] no fault at all
[58:41] now what you think about this
[58:43] the enemy that's how many of you before
[58:46] we get started you're too good how many
[58:49] of you have that accuser in your ear
[58:53] oh I'm preaching the right group
[58:55] yeah because I do
[58:58] I too have that accuser in my ear
[59:03] so we're preaching to him this morning
[59:09] so one day the guy that's accusing us
[59:15] the one day the guy that's whispering in
[59:17] our ear
[59:19] well what
[59:21] they don't love you they don't care for
[59:23] you Jesus don't love you you're not a
[59:26] Christian
[59:27] point out your thoughts in your failures
[59:29] it's constantly in your ear because he's
[59:32] doing his job
[59:34] one day that same accuser
[59:40] because of our lamb
[59:44] we'll have to say
[59:47] Satan listen up he'll have to say it I
[59:49] find no fault in The Bride of Jesus
[59:51] Christ
[59:56] she's without spider Emma I couldn't
[59:59] produce a wife like that I can produce a
[1:00:02] denominational system that I couldn't
[1:00:04] produce a Ruth
[1:00:08] I couldn't produce her I couldn't redeem
[1:00:11] her you heard it last week I couldn't
[1:00:13] redeem her
[1:00:15] but Jesus can produce a life like this
[1:00:22] [Applause]
[1:00:27] now if you've got a way you say ups and
[1:00:31] downs and ups and downs
[1:00:34] I would advise you to go to God
[1:00:38] and stay there until you're really born
[1:00:40] again when trials and troubles and
[1:00:42] heartaches and disappointment sets in
[1:00:45] something holds you
[1:00:47] we're all going to have them
[1:00:50] it's not you holding it's something
[1:00:53] holding you
[1:00:57] it isn't a question whether I hold on or
[1:00:59] not it's a question
[1:01:02] he held on or not
[1:01:05] it isn't looking at me
[1:01:09] it's looking at him
[1:01:12] because he was the one if a man came
[1:01:14] here not a man came here a lot long ago
[1:01:16] said brother Branham I'm not worthy to
[1:01:18] be saved and he said
[1:01:20] no you're not
[1:01:23] he started weeping he said I've tried
[1:01:26] since in 1940 to get saved but I find
[1:01:30] myself not worthy brother Branham says
[1:01:33] you never will be worthy
[1:01:37] he said then I could never be saved he
[1:01:39] said oh no
[1:01:41] it isn't you it's him
[1:01:44] God don't look at you
[1:01:50] I'm
[1:01:52] God don't look at you
[1:01:55] he looks at him
[1:01:57] and if he can find fault in him then you
[1:02:01] can't be saved but if there's no thought
[1:02:04] in him then you're all right
[1:02:07] the blemish that you find in him is on
[1:02:10] you but if there's no blemish in you in
[1:02:14] him then there's no blemish on you
[1:02:21] so then we can repeat it like God Jesus
[1:02:24] repeated I came from God and I'm going
[1:02:27] back to God
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:35] now the devil does not want you to get
[1:02:37] this Revelation this morning
[1:02:40] he doesn't I want you to quit beating on
[1:02:43] yourself
[1:02:47] there's a thing called self-sabotage I'm
[1:02:49] not going to get into it
[1:02:51] but a lot of times when we're on a diet
[1:03:00] right before Thanksgiving
[1:03:03] the things that you can't have you crave
[1:03:06] the most
[1:03:11] your water goes out you're so thirsty
[1:03:13] for water
[1:03:15] you wasn't thirsty before the spicket
[1:03:17] quit but now you're thirsty for water
[1:03:21] you you went on a diet and you have you
[1:03:25] have promised I'm not going to eat any
[1:03:26] sugar today and you go right by Krispy
[1:03:29] Kreme and the hot sign is on
[1:03:40] you know what the devil will do to you
[1:03:44] because he knows that you have crossed
[1:03:46] the barrier
[1:03:48] so you'll go into a restaurant
[1:03:53] and that old time rock and roll the kind
[1:03:55] of music that just
[1:04:04] soothes the soul
[1:04:12] I was a Bob Seger fan
[1:04:15] I can sing them songs
[1:04:27] all of a sudden you're sitting at a
[1:04:28] table and your foot's going
[1:04:30] you're having a spiritual conversation
[1:04:32] your foot's going
[1:04:36] Satan's trying to trap you
[1:04:39] and he's the kind of guy that will talk
[1:04:42] something and then call the police
[1:04:48] and then he'll tell you you're just uh
[1:04:51] you're you're just horrible
[1:04:56] he'll make your temper fly up I know
[1:04:58] nobody's in this building's got a
[1:05:00] problem
[1:05:02] you husbands and wives live a perfect
[1:05:05] life
[1:05:07] and you can go on the job work eight ten
[1:05:10] hours come home and he'll stir a little
[1:05:12] friction in the house
[1:05:15] and your wife or your husband knows
[1:05:17] exactly where the panic button is Boo
[1:05:22] he walks out the door says job
[1:05:24] accomplished and you're two perfectly
[1:05:27] good Christians
[1:05:35] Zach Mary y'all y'all are angels I know
[1:05:39] you are you just got married haven't had
[1:05:41] an issue probably whatsoever none none
[1:05:44] none none well look whatsoever
[1:05:48] wait
[1:05:56] you can go to bed feeling like you're in
[1:05:58] raptured condition
[1:06:01] and have a dream
[1:06:03] I woke up one morning
[1:06:05] sister Connie woke me up to go to work
[1:06:07] back when in the Arsenal days when I was
[1:06:09] working on at the Arsenal and I woke up
[1:06:13] I walked into the kitchen I said good
[1:06:15] morning baby
[1:06:17] you know what you did to me
[1:06:21] don't you call me baby
[1:06:35] [Applause]
[1:06:38] she said when she woke me up I shook my
[1:06:40] fist in her face
[1:06:49] I've never hit her in her life
[1:06:55] I'm not guilty
[1:07:01] she remembers it to this day
[1:07:07] have I got you on the same page now
[1:07:15] we come to church sometimes almost in
[1:07:18] the Blues because we've been beat around
[1:07:20] all week long
[1:07:23] and we leave on Sunday morning and we go
[1:07:25] wow we could have Rapture this week and
[1:07:29] Monday comes
[1:07:34] but if we can only turn it on him
[1:07:38] if we could just turn it on him and say
[1:07:41] hey wait a minute Falcons sir wait a
[1:07:44] minute I know you're trying to do your
[1:07:45] job
[1:07:47] I know you're trying to do your job and
[1:07:49] you're good at your job but I am worthy
[1:07:54] by the blood of Jesus Christ I'm more
[1:07:57] than a conqueror through the blood of
[1:07:59] Jesus Christ I'm a mighty warrior
[1:08:02] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:04] there's no blemish that is against me
[1:08:06] God holds nothing nothing against me
[1:08:12] [Applause]
[1:08:25] now when the sin of the
[1:08:28] when that sin
[1:08:30] of that mortal
[1:08:32] is confessed
[1:08:36] and dropped into the Clorox
[1:08:40] the bleach of Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] it bleaches all sin
[1:08:49] he is purely
[1:08:51] unadulterated without sin
[1:08:55] and without thought
[1:09:06] do you know how quickly that can happen
[1:09:09] seconds
[1:09:12] seconds
[1:09:17] then why should we throw a rock
[1:09:20] at somebody sitting in our same church
[1:09:26] that's going to be sitting at the table
[1:09:33] or or your wife or your husband or your
[1:09:35] children
[1:09:38] then
[1:09:39] You Know The Enemy that that causes you
[1:09:42] to pick up that rock and Jesus got on
[1:09:44] the ground
[1:09:46] and he wrote on the ground
[1:09:48] and they had they had right by law to
[1:09:52] Stone her
[1:09:55] and he wrote on the ground he that is
[1:09:57] without sin
[1:09:58] because they didn't have a lamb
[1:10:03] he that is without sin cast the first
[1:10:06] stone
[1:10:09] they had a they had they had turtle
[1:10:12] doves and they had sacrifices that only
[1:10:15] covered the sin but they still had the
[1:10:17] desire to sin
[1:10:20] Jesus knew their thoughts
[1:10:23] but he was getting ready to forgive her
[1:10:25] of her sins notice the words that he
[1:10:28] says woman
[1:10:32] where is thine accusers and she said I
[1:10:35] have none and he said neither
[1:10:40] neither do I
[1:10:42] think about that
[1:10:45] let's go to Jesus's church for a moment
[1:10:48] you think they didn't have flaws
[1:10:53] okay
[1:10:55] one of your head preachers
[1:10:59] one of your head preachers has took a
[1:11:02] sword
[1:11:03] and cut a man's ear off
[1:11:05] he's used Blasphemous names
[1:11:08] he's been found naked cursing
[1:11:13] and this is the guy that's going to
[1:11:15] preach repent and be baptized every one
[1:11:17] of you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:19] Christ the Eternal prescription but
[1:11:23] under the flaw
[1:11:25] there's a lot of bad things that is held
[1:11:28] against him and it must blow Satan's
[1:11:31] mind that God can take Peter from this
[1:11:34] position cursing
[1:11:37] abominable things naked
[1:11:42] High temporary
[1:11:44] supposedly on his way to be in a
[1:11:47] murderer
[1:11:48] and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:52] God places his life inside of him and
[1:11:55] now he becomes the spokesman of the
[1:11:57] church
[1:12:00] foreign
[1:12:03] Jesus finds himself in a position to
[1:12:05] word that he has to go send his
[1:12:08] disciples away because they would not
[1:12:09] understand a predestinated seed can be
[1:12:13] inside of mud
[1:12:15] and so he sends them away
[1:12:18] and he goes by Samaria
[1:12:22] Samaria was a place where that
[1:12:25] had bad names
[1:12:27] and this was a woman that had five
[1:12:29] husbands and was living with another man
[1:12:35] whatever
[1:12:36] she couldn't come at other times
[1:12:38] brother Branham will tell this story
[1:12:42] hundreds
[1:12:44] times
[1:12:46] hundreds of times
[1:12:50] I don't know if you've seen the chosen
[1:12:52] series how they did it but I think they
[1:12:53] did a really good job with it if you
[1:12:56] haven't seen that go go watch that
[1:12:59] especially that woman at the well scene
[1:13:02] it's phenomenal
[1:13:04] they capture it
[1:13:06] and he sat in there and he said I want a
[1:13:08] drink
[1:13:12] and she's looking for a messiah but in
[1:13:14] her condition
[1:13:15] the church don't want her
[1:13:20] the church don't want her
[1:13:25] but God's going to use her as a
[1:13:26] testimony
[1:13:30] it's going to use her as a testimony
[1:13:32] and there's not a doubt in my mind that
[1:13:34] the accuser that was in her ear that's
[1:13:35] in your ear reminded her though she was
[1:13:39] looking for a messiah you'll never get
[1:13:40] him
[1:13:41] but it wasn't she would find the Messiah
[1:13:44] the Messiah found her
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:58] sister Catherine you walked up here last
[1:14:00] week
[1:14:01] an incredible need
[1:14:04] you'd been to doctors
[1:14:07] but there was a doctor came to you
[1:14:10] and he changed the whole seems the whole
[1:14:13] outlook on things
[1:14:15] what a difference one day can make in a
[1:14:17] life
[1:14:18] one day you've got cancer next day you
[1:14:21] don't
[1:14:22] I'm going tomorrow I'm I'm looking for a
[1:14:24] report I'm hoping for a report that Ron
[1:14:27] you don't have cancer no more
[1:14:29] that's what I'm looking for
[1:14:32] why not believe it
[1:14:34] why not believe it
[1:14:38] people say well you you don't look like
[1:14:41] you have four stage cancer you're right
[1:14:43] it's just riding like an Uber car
[1:14:47] it's just riding one of these days it
[1:14:49] won't be able to ride no more it's your
[1:14:52] spot to get off
[1:14:53] [Applause]
[1:15:01] and Jesus
[1:15:04] he talks to her a bit
[1:15:08] and he announces to her that he is the
[1:15:10] Messiah he's not announced that to no
[1:15:13] other man
[1:15:15] that I'm the Messiah
[1:15:18] because she had a seed that had an
[1:15:21] eternal Realm
[1:15:23] now the Accuser
[1:15:25] and no doubt future accusers would say
[1:15:29] look who's in his church
[1:15:33] but because of him
[1:15:35] she was pure as a lily
[1:15:44] because of him you're as pure as a lily
[1:15:51] foreign
[1:15:55] Jesus got in a boat after a meeting
[1:15:58] crossed the waters come to see
[1:16:03] got off of the boat
[1:16:05] walked into a graveyard
[1:16:07] and there was a man there
[1:16:09] had been there he was
[1:16:12] completely away from society to where
[1:16:16] that he wasn't trusted he was in Chains
[1:16:19] none of us would want him in church
[1:16:23] if you're saying in your mind this guy
[1:16:28] was put out of society he wasn't welcome
[1:16:31] at home he wasn't welcome at his family
[1:16:33] he definitely wasn't welcome at church
[1:16:35] he wasn't welcome in the community
[1:16:39] but Jesus went to him
[1:16:43] and the demons cried out of him
[1:16:46] because he was the perfect lamb
[1:16:49] and they identified who he was and
[1:16:52] sometimes that's what the devil does to
[1:16:54] you
[1:16:57] because they can see the light on the
[1:17:00] inside of you and so immediately they'll
[1:17:02] feel condemned around you
[1:17:05] they'll quit cussing they'll quit doing
[1:17:06] different kind of things they'll quit
[1:17:08] showing you all different kind of stuff
[1:17:10] because of the life that lays on inside
[1:17:12] of you and you may have never said a
[1:17:14] word to them
[1:17:16] you represent something more than a
[1:17:19] church
[1:17:20] this ain't about this church on this
[1:17:23] hill it's about him
[1:17:25] [Applause]
[1:17:30] when Jesus left this man
[1:17:36] Jesus cast out
[1:17:40] those demons
[1:17:42] into Hawks
[1:17:46] and those Hogs had more sense than most
[1:17:49] people
[1:17:50] and they jumped off of a cliff
[1:17:54] and then people got mad
[1:17:57] because they lost their Hogs
[1:18:02] they should have been rejoicing this man
[1:18:04] is that is sane and by clothed and in
[1:18:08] his right mind
[1:18:10] but big people get I'm following me now
[1:18:13] people get mad because you don't go to
[1:18:15] their parties no more
[1:18:19] they want the old you back but they all
[1:18:22] use dead
[1:18:23] [Applause]
[1:18:25] the old use not coming back
[1:18:29] I'm sorry I'm not that guy that used to
[1:18:32] live here
[1:18:34] I look like him I I walk like him I I
[1:18:37] talk like him but the new guy that lives
[1:18:40] on the inside of me
[1:18:45] has a new king
[1:18:51] but I knew you went
[1:18:54] yeah yeah you did you did
[1:18:59] but even my accuser
[1:19:01] since I find no fault
[1:19:13] I want to I want to bring you to a point
[1:19:22] brother Branham is going to be the
[1:19:23] church age messenger
[1:19:25] that will do something that nobody else
[1:19:27] has been able to do
[1:19:28] to give us the seals the church ages
[1:19:32] and represent Christ in this age
[1:19:37] brother baranum is born in a family
[1:19:40] that has to change its name two seven
[1:19:43] letters
[1:19:46] because they're on the run from the law
[1:19:51] and brother branham's Daddy
[1:19:53] they were they were Catholics
[1:19:56] and
[1:19:58] they
[1:20:00] made moonshine
[1:20:02] I'm not going to ask you but
[1:20:04] um
[1:20:05] a lot a lot of you've moved in here I
[1:20:08] want you to understand
[1:20:09] we're not a bunch of angels here
[1:20:14] a great number of our families
[1:20:18] came from bootleg families
[1:20:21] mine included
[1:20:24] came from bootleg families
[1:20:27] but God knew
[1:20:34] we don't have a wing hang up here
[1:20:38] where do you hang your wings up before
[1:20:40] church and then pick them up afterwards
[1:20:42] we all were sinners
[1:20:46] and their sins passed down on us
[1:20:52] brother Branham was carrying water to
[1:20:54] his daddy's Steel
[1:20:57] as a little boy and a whirlwind got in
[1:21:00] that that tree
[1:21:02] and told him to never drink or Never
[1:21:04] Smoke
[1:21:06] I gotta work for you to do
[1:21:09] brother Brown dropped the bucket and ran
[1:21:11] into the house and many of them called
[1:21:12] him a nervous child
[1:21:16] no doubting Corey he carried a lot of
[1:21:18] more buckets of water to that steel
[1:21:21] but he never drank or he never smoked he
[1:21:24] would try but he would hear that
[1:21:26] Whirlwind again
[1:21:29] remember he had a little darling girl
[1:21:32] that he really liked
[1:21:35] and it come out of the building and she
[1:21:37] had a cigarette in her mouth
[1:21:39] and he walked home
[1:21:43] let me just say this to you brother
[1:21:45] Branham the man
[1:21:49] if God would have let him
[1:21:52] because of his past he would have been a
[1:21:55] murderer
[1:21:58] listen he would have killed those boys
[1:22:03] he'd have took that rifle and killed
[1:22:05] those boys and you know by history
[1:22:07] brother Branham was an incredible shot
[1:22:11] he was a phenomenal shot
[1:22:14] he would have killed him but God had to
[1:22:17] overlook the flaw
[1:22:22] he had to override the flaw cause he had
[1:22:26] a fix
[1:22:29] for the flaw
[1:22:32] this was the man that's going to
[1:22:34] fellowship with the angel of the Lord
[1:22:39] he's going to see him move in the
[1:22:40] building night after night after night
[1:22:42] he's going to see him appearing in motel
[1:22:45] rooms
[1:22:48] gonna see him appear in a cave
[1:22:51] for the first time and then throughout
[1:22:55] his life he would have fellowship with
[1:22:57] that angel that would bring us this
[1:22:59] message
[1:23:01] listen when you read a book or you
[1:23:03] listen to a tape
[1:23:04] that's more than the mind of William
[1:23:06] Branham
[1:23:09] that's more than just his thoughts
[1:23:12] even in his good opinions
[1:23:16] no brother Branham was not God but a
[1:23:19] fellowship with the angels of God
[1:23:29] people want to point out his flaws
[1:23:33] ain't no problem to me I knew them
[1:23:36] things when I was a kid
[1:23:40] but if you take that same microscope
[1:23:44] and point it back at yourself
[1:23:51] point it back at yourself
[1:23:53] you can get on Google and find bad
[1:23:55] things about me I have no doubt but let
[1:23:58] me just say this to you I'm identified
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:03] I'm identified with this lamb

[1:24:39] and I'm neither democrat or republican
[1:24:41] or whatever
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:45] they're all rotten
[1:24:55] they're all rotten they're all just
[1:24:57] stinking right
[1:25:00] but I am
[1:25:02] I'm identified in inner Glory
[1:25:05] and I'm identified in her shame
[1:25:08] because of that flag
[1:25:11] and because of Veterans Day this week
[1:25:13] thank you
[1:25:14] because of Veterans Day this week
[1:25:19] I can stand here and preach to you
[1:25:23] this message and we don't have to hide
[1:25:26] in a cage
[1:25:29] and we don't have to be ashamed of what
[1:25:31] we believe
[1:25:32] and we don't have to water it down and
[1:25:34] dilute it down
[1:25:37] I was identified at Plymouth Rock I was
[1:25:40] identified at Guam I was identified in
[1:25:42] the wars
[1:25:45] but I'm identified with Jesus Christ
[1:25:48] hanging on the cross I'm identified he's
[1:25:50] no longer and a cross he's no longer on
[1:25:53] a tomb he is Our Risen Savior he is our
[1:25:57] great high priest today I'm identified
[1:25:59] with the Lamb of God
[1:26:03] [Applause]

[1:26:51] through the streets of gold
[1:27:00] we'll enjoy all of Heaven's Beauty
[1:27:04] but the greatest thing we want to hear
[1:27:06] him say is
[1:27:15] I want to be very honest with you
[1:27:18] I never want to bring him shame
[1:27:23] I never want to bring him shame
[1:27:27] I never want to inflict a wound
[1:27:30] on him today

[1:28:13] overcomer
[1:28:14] and you can make it through any dark
[1:28:16] trial that you've got to go through
[1:28:19] because some of you I may be fighting

[1:29:16] but I knew you were coming
[1:29:19] I had no doubt I knew you were coming
[1:29:24] your great-grandfather
[1:29:27] but I never asked you to fill out a
[1:29:29] sheet and saying this is my faults
[1:29:36] is that right
[1:29:39] and this is what you're going to have to
[1:29:40] watch out for in me brother Ron
