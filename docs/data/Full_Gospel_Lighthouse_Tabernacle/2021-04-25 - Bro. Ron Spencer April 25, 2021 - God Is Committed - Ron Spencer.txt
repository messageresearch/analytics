love you with all of our hearts so good to see jason this morning a sunday morning god bless you amen a lot of prayers that went your way and for a long time and we're glad to be a part of your life amen won't you just turn your neighbor saying i'm glad to be a part of your life amen amen we're going to do this for eternity you know amen amen god bless you we love you with all of our hearts and thankful for the presence of the lord i had just sent connie a note and i'll just share this with you just sent connie a note just before just be just in the middle of the sinking that i was very sick and then i sent her a note i said the angel's standing with me now and about that time it busted loose out here so amen so be aware that he's here amen amen if you turn with me matthew chapter 6 verse 9 so glad to be with you i want to remember brother homer longora he wrote me a note this morning said the copd that he has is just just really working on him and getting him down and so i told him that we would have prayer for him and also brother kelly hildebrandt's parents they're both in the hospital here at the same time and so i told him that we would pray for them again as i as i take the pulpit this morning many needs that are among us and we know god's a healer he's not diminished his power one little iota when he saves the most wicked sinner in the world it does not diminish his grace none none when he heals even to the point of death it does not diminish his power to heal none it's not like your bank account that when you write a check something comes out hallelujah god is unlimited in his power it is we that limit him but he's unlimited in his power amen amen his disciples asked him to teach them how to pray and i would say if there's anybody that could teach us how to pray god himself could teach us how to pray and i'd like for you to read this with me this morning and then we'll go forward in a word after this manna pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen let's take these needs to the lord this morning maybe you have a need on your heart you'd like to lift it before the lord i sure do and i know he's he hears every prayer father this morning we bow our heads before you to the eternal god that hears and answers prayer lord with the many needs that have been called across this audience as brother homer longora sent out to me early this morning to remember him lord the copd that is in his body the lungs it's hard to fight when you can't breathe and lord i ask you to send a surge of the holy ghost to where he's at even now father touch his body brother kelly hildebrandt's parents that are both in the hospital today lord i ask you to go to brother harry and sister mary lou lord you're a faithful high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities and now we ask you that you would come and touch their bodies hands have been raised all across this building all through the internet audience we ask you that you'd send your word and as i stand behind this pulpit this morning i ask you that you touch my own body father lord do a work dear god we tell the devil boo one more time and stand and proclaim the eternal word of god that never that it never fails and we pray that you'd speak to our hearts and in jesus christ's name we thank you for this presence today amen and amen and amen amen you can be seated this morning i'd like to speak to you this morning and and for those that heard when we were at brother paul's on saturday night i just took a portion of this and we will go forward with it god is committed god is committed and understand god never has a thought and then has to change it he never wrote a scripture and then later on amended it are you with me now man's thoughts change man's thoughts differ with the ages of opinions but god's word is eternal brother brandon would use the term many times heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away so where would i rather be at in heaven or in earth or in his word his word is eternal [Applause] the scripture says in saint john chapter 14 and verse 20 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you sometimes we diminish the thought that jesus must be in heaven but he's inside of you so he has not lost his power any sometimes we look for a physical corporal body of jesus christ and it's coming but he's living on the inside of you psalms chapter 8 118 and verse 22 the stone which the builders refused it's become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes we heard about a god in action last night this is the day which the lord hath made and we will rejoice and be glad in it if we could understand that we're literally living out the vision of god today we think of a vision being fulfilled like 42-inch caribou horns exactly and they still remain the same and that vision was fulfilled brother ray if me and you to stand there we'd have been shouting hallelujah when we saw that 42-inch like brother biscuit was shouting or the silvertip grizzly bear where only moments before brother bud sawflix said i could see for miles but i i i don't see it and they knew but according to the vision before they got back down to the tent that that grizzly bear had to be killed not just a grizzly bear but silver tipped grizzly bear one which bud sophomore could never sing before and he said i can see for miles and brother brad i'm asking are you doubting the vision bud sometimes we need to even ask ourselves are we doubting the vision [Applause] we're sitting in a service where god is moving and getting us ready just before the rapture are we doubting what god's doing among us are you with me in ephesians chapters 2 and verse 8 it says for by grace you are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works less than any man should boast you couldn't do nothing to save yourself now notice these next words for we are his workmanship now let's remember what his workmanship is just for a moment in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he spoke the word from that logos of light and he believed his own word and the son came into existence and brother brahm said the clickers would fall off the sun and god would watch them for so long maybe millions of years and he would stop them just in the right place because he was writing his first bible god believed his own word are you with me he didn't get us here to quit believing his own word [Applause] he didn't get us this far to lose us he didn't get us this far to quit on us somebody help me preach now [Applause] for we are his workmanship so let's take him at his word god's not a liar and when god saved you and brooded over you how many remember that when god began to brood over you and you went looking for god god came looking for you maybe you were in a bar room maybe you were in a dead church god began to deal in your life and begin to pull on you you couldn't reach up to god god came rich down to you [Applause] moved your life in a certain way that you'd be sitting here today are you with me the devil don't make you sit here he didn't put that in your heart to serve god and want more of god brother jason he put something in your heart to thirst and hunger for god and more of god more of god and more of god that ain't the devil that's doing that god's at work he's at work and the inside of you he's not dormant he's at work remember he's the great provider jesus is standing with his disciples in saint john chapter 14. you know jesus walked in two worlds at the same time you hear brother branham use this text this thought he says now i'm standing in two worlds at the same time how many of you ever come to a service like this morning and you walk out and you just you just feel like you've been lifted and all of your problems are nothing they're just they're just evaporated all the petty things of life is just just nothing all the personal relationships are just nothing now and god just lifts you into another realm jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions are you with me you're standing here you're grey-headed you're needing glasses your body is debilitating and god's already got it taken care of amen he's already got it taken care of and you're you're looking at your mortal flesh and you're sometimes humiliated by your mortal flesh maybe your memory doesn't work quite right or you can't have a conversation even quite right or and you knew what you used to be you know what you used to be capable of and and yet god has it got it all in control at the same time [Applause] in my father's house are many mansions and and if it were not so i would tell you i and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also [Applause] and whether i go you know and the way that you know and thomas saith unto him lord we know not whether thou go us and how can we know the way and jesus he gave the eternal prescription right here [Applause] i am the way not one of the ways i am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me and if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him and i just want to say this right here that same personal god is in the building this morning and this message is more than books and tapes and pictures and stories and and analogies of other people this message is christ being personally revealed to you as an individual and he has such a way to make your experience personal that nobody else has one like it [Applause] why brother ron god is committed to you now brother brahman says in things that are to be and this is a sermon of two worlds it's a prophecy he says you were all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for the many generations back so that you could be here tonight did you know that just think that you at one time and he said i'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at the time and neither did you know him at the time but you see then you were put into the bedding ground in the womb of your mother through holy wedrock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father then there's fellowship and brother brandon is talking about the human aspect now but now he's going to go to another level now the only way that you can be a son or daughter of god is because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's god's life only one form of eternal life and it's god's life we could repeat that over and over and over again to be a son of god you had to be in him always brother on we've heard that a thousand times did we get it did we get it did we get it because let me just say this to you how many times in our normal daily walk does satan make us feel like you're backslid god don't love you you might as well walk away why don't you quit because he knows if you get this quote right here that if you ever was in god it isn't you holding on it's god holding on to you hallelujah i said this at paul's i've said it here before if you could you'd walk away because you can't hold yourself but there's something holding you it's eternal life there's no end to it glory hallelujah hallelujah so the next moment you're having a real dark moment remind the devil of that spot i was with god in the beginning hallelujah and if god ever thought of me he's committed to me notice this quote when god makes a promise to you he will fulfill it you're taking your time brother ron yeah because i want you to get this when god makes a promise to you he will fulfill it you don't have to be afraid that he will not keep his word for god will keep his word deep call it to the deep you've watched it many times he says now you know that when the deep cost to the deep there's got to be a deep to respond to it and there's got to he said you believe that don't you david said when the deep calleth to the deep in other words like this before something can be calling out for something there has to be something out there for this in here to be calling to now in other words i've made this statement before before there was a fin on a fish's back isn't that so simple he's standing in washington d.c at one of the most prestigious halls and he's telling america what's the secret to success and how big god is and yet it was so simple before there was a fin on a fish's back there had to be water first for him to swim in or he wouldn't have to have a fin he had never had to have a fin if there was no water before there could be a tree to grow on the earth there has to be an earth there first or there had been no tree to grow in why are you here there's a deep calling to the deep. let me just put it in real simple language for the bride of jesus christ we're not too nervous about everything that the world's going through the world is falling apart it's supposed to our government does not have an answer education doesn't have an answer science doesn't have an answer i got the pfizer shocked then i'm going supposed to get another one this week and now that we're hearing that there's going to be another one after that one and then there's another one after that one that might go on forever until one day i don't make the appointment because i've been raptured in the media you can tell that they're afraid to even say anything one way or another because there's some power that's white black pink yellow there's some voice out there is going to get their job [Applause] and people can't even make an open statement without fear of of somebody taking their job or a right to break up it's because the world has fallen apart [Applause] but i find it amazing that god's word is so eternal he makes a statement and he never has to apologize for it he tells women how to dress in deuteronomy and he never has to change it [Applause] tells men how to behave and he never has to change it men be men women be women husbands love your wife as christ loved the church and gave himself for it gives you the best description of how to run your marriage you don't have to come around and give 52 amendments of how to fix it all back up it's god's word it's settled then he also said before you were born in the belly i knew you [Applause] [Music] god don't have to wait till you come on the earth and he waits till you get up 30 40 50 years old and go nope i don't like him [Applause] god deposited something on the inside of you and he loved you while you was yet an alien of the commonwealth of god you were drunks dope addicts harlots prostitutes whatever you was god wasn't looking at that part he was looking at the deposited part that he put inside of you before the foundation of the world that's eternal [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] so i want to ask you a favor quit looking at your past mistakes who i feel god quit looking at your past march onward march onward we're marching to zion but you don't know what i was i could care less what you was [Applause] but god is rich in mercy i love this quote more than able to supply ever need who could take daniel out of the lines then and the hebrew children out of a fiery and ron spencer out of the depth of cancer i'll put that there i hope that's okay god that can open up the red sea and put people to walk across on dry land and can raise up lazarus from the dead and take elijah home and a chariot that god has never failed put him on record he's never failed it was a sad day when i stood at the graveside of my mother just like with your loved ones and our heart was broken but if we can look god made her a promise that where i am there you may be also so he was able to heal her heart and all of her condition and she was not a gray-headed woman that had trouble with her knees or her weight or anything like that but she stands as a young beautiful woman tonight just as god saw before the foundation of the world she only returned to that [Applause] the authentic realm god didn't have to wring his hands when your loved ones died he had prepared a body brother meadows [Applause] he had prepared for your family listen there's not a doctor in the world that can do that but my jesus can take it when everybody else has given up and you slip from this veil of tears because of adam's sin and eve sin and jesus said i am the way. [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah the scripture said just forgive me i'm going to go through some scriptures very quickly you don't have to keep up just pay attention philippians 4 verse 13 i can do all things through him which strengthens me philippians 4 13 fear not for i am with you be not this dismissed for i am your god i will strengthen you i will help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand deuteronomy 31 and 6 be strong and courageous do not fear or be in dread of me for it is the lord your god who goes with you he will not leave you or forsake thee for they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount upon wings like an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not fakes [Applause] no temptation has overtook it to overtake you that is not common to man god is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability but with the temptation he will also provide a way to escape that you may be able to overcome it the lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation this is my god and i will praise him my father's god and i will exalt him finally my finally be strong in the lord and the strength of his might for the lord your god is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory god is committed to you but brother ron my life's not like anybody else's life you just woke up that's exactly right nobody knows the valleys you go through or the sorrows or the mountaintops that you've got to climb the cliffs that you've got to go over but god said i'm going to be with you [Applause] can you imagine when god created the canyons in the midwest and every one of them has their beauty and their color god created that there's stones laying on top of stones you wonder how in the world did that get there brother ma'am said it was god's mortal box that he just emptied out what a way to put it what a way to put it god also you know mount rushmore has got the presidents i look like one of them but got all the presidents there four of them so god decided they wanted brother branham's in in the desert so he sent a whirlwind right down across the edge of that mountain and cut it out in just a few seconds and there's brother branham's image right there on that mountain don't want that one mount baker when the snow comes on it you can look at mount baker from the bible way camp and see brother branham and his cowboy hat let me just say god when he was putting this whole world together was thinking of you [Applause] mountains deserts seas he knew where you would like to live when you look at this valley and this expanse and this is one of the most beautiful places in the world he knew you'd like to be here so he had your mothers and fathers to do some traveling to get you here so i'm going to read it again the lord your god is is he who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory you're watching me experience that scripture as i preach to you for he saith unto me my grace is sufficient for my power is made perfect in weakness i'm reading the passion translation in case you get lost therefore i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may rest upon me for the sake of christ then i am content when i'm weakened with weaknesses and insults and hardships and persecutions and calamities for when i'm weak then i'm strong so when your world is falling apart god has not left you [Applause] how many has ever had your world you just fall apart you got out of bed and we should have stayed there that day am i alone i went to bed last night felt absolutely perfect no sister connie didn't drug me or beat me got up this morning my my sugar was over 400 my uh i was upset my chemo began to react on me and everything went kind of nuts hey i still got to preach do i just throw in the towel call in sick or do i walk right up in the face of the devil and say boo one more time [Music] then what about you then what about you oh brother ron but i've come to the end of my rope tie knot hang on but i want to remind you you're not the one hanging on he's got a hull to you your feet are dangling you don't know where you're going to wind up your your head is going in every different direction your world's been flipping upside down but god's got a hold of you the biggest constant in our lives is jesus [Applause] enjoy for god gave us a spirit not a fear but a power and of love and a sound mind have not i commanded you to be strong and courageous [Music] don't be frightened do not be dismayed for the lord your god is with you whether so ever you go brother branham was standing in a cave with an angel of the lord that's right this angel about six foot tall dark complected shoulder-length hair dark eyes was telling him i'm going to be with you amen the president of the united states wasn't there no how you know what happened it took him at his word and i've seen it for 30 plus years of ministry that when brother branham was standing on the pulpit and a stubborn devil wouldn't leave he would remind the devil of that cave experience i'm taking you somewhere now well brother ron how can you believe brother branham he was there by himself well can we believe mary can we believe mary she's a teenage girl and she meets an angel and the scripture had been prophecy had been foretold 800 years and a lot of families thought that their daughter was going to be that chosen one and she's not in the who's who but the angel meets her and she takes him at the word but that was brother branham that was mary what about you [Applause] president wasn't there when god called you and he began to deal with you and maybe you was in a room all alone or maybe you was in a church with 500 people they didn't get what you got you walked to the archer and god met you because he's committed and then brother branham said god ignites that seed on the inside of you and then every devil in hell will try to talk you out of it [Applause] but it don't make a difference what the critic says about you it's you and god two in the bed want to be taken two in the field want to be taken two at the meal want to be taken it's you and god brother john besides that you learned this in kindergarten sticks and stones will break my bones but your words will never hurt me stupid devil hey i'm having fun now the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i feel the lord is a stronghold of my life of whom shall i be afraid be strong and let your heart be take courage all you who wait on the lord my flesh and my heart may fail but god it's the strength of my heart and my portion forever god is our refuge and strength and a very present help in trouble men get in a crisis god don't am i talking to you now men get in a crisis god don't through those that are watching overseas under different conditions your government might be doing many different things with the corruptness but god never gets in a crisis with you when he makes you a promise [Music] he don't amend it because you're in yugoslavia or you're in south africa or you're in europe god doesn't amend it it's the same holy ghost everywhere and remember he's the same yesterday today and forever brother man said he says i want you to know he's the god of the woods he's the same god of the city he's just as much god out there as he is here god always deals with men according to their capacity isaiah 45 and verse 21 tell ye bring them near yea let them take counsel together who have declared this from the ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else besides me a just god and a savior and there is none beside me amen isaiah 45 and 22 look unto me and ye shall be saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else i have swore by myself the word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return i'm driving it now that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swell you remember this earlier in the sermon when god gives you a promise to you he will fulfill it philippians 1 6 being confident that this very thing that he which hath begun a good work with you in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ now i've given you a tremendous amount of word a tremendous amount of things that god says i've made you a promise and i'm not going to quit what you think about this i want to thank you think real clear about this if god's brought us this far he'll finish ruthanne said god's not the kind of god that goes bankrupt runs out of funds that's what happens to businesses they get a new idea and they're successful in one thing and all of a sudden they start doing something new and before long they run out of money and they go bankrupt i get kind of aggravated when i roll up to a to a nice cabela's and they got a sign on the door no longer in business i get aggravated i want to i want to walk in there and see those mounts and yeah you know i've never i've never came to this church and had a sign on the door says now god quit healing here so we're we're not going over here and he's not going to save no more so we no need to have church come on church oh brother ron you ought to have been here i love what andrew said last night it may have caught you a little bit off guard but you know god was god was with brother homer when he when he was in brother bill's basement he led him there and then there was when i was up there in the ding building and he saw the vision of the ceiling falling down that's the building and god was there but god didn't quit there [Applause] and he was he was god with him down there in summon avenue when brother harold and sister denise got married first marriage in the church god didn't quit there [Applause] and then he had a vision for this hill and bulldozing this hill off and all the trees is up here just look at your front yard look out there god made that so you could take a picture in front of it [Applause] he he he watched over that whole thing [Music] now listen we have buried sometimes 19 people in a year listen they didn't go falling off a cliff somewhere near they got a new body [Applause] and they're waiting on you to finish it but because they left and their time ran out they were looking for the resurrection they were looking for the rapture but their time run out that don't mean god quit [Applause] i don't mean he quit that don't mean he wasn't in business that don't mean he didn't fulfill his promise they just stepped on the other side of the chasm fellowshipping and in a few days we'll come back together [Applause] can i preach to you just a couple more minutes [Applause] now 2 000 years ago and the reason i did that's because i want to do this to him that overcometh in revelations 3 remember where this was written on the isle of of patmos in a prison and so god is looking today at this church and he says stephen this scripture's for you now there are scriptures in the bible that talk about noah jeremiah nahum zebedee names i can't say abraham david joseph there are identifiable scriptures that have a personality character went with them and there was a time date that was with them and they lived their life and they were that book they were that epistle of that age but god doesn't take the time and say now stephen chris john he's he's not he's he's not going to go all right now stephen to you that overcome this age i'll grant to sit with me in my throne so he doesn't write your name there but your name is there [Laughter] are you with me well he was sitting on the front row well that's what you get when you sit on the front row let me just look over this way gabriel named after the angels yeah strong angel probably made you strong in your personality so god doesn't write gabriel down one day you'll meet sarah have fourteen children aren't you glad you didn't say it take a deep breath but god put your name in there and you have to get a revelation of your heart he's talking about me now he's talking about me are you with me oh brother ron it'd be easy if your name was written there sure it would be but how many other parents would have called their kids ronald dean everybody in your neighborhood would be called shannon shannon shannon overcomer of the age shannon but you find your name in the book [Applause] you see yourself and you become a living written epistle read and known of all men and you're not shaken you're not you're not moving every which away you're not in a cyclone every day because god is committed to you [Music] help me now so the challenge is for you to find your name written in the book [Music] so there's going to be challenges sure they are there's going to be distresses sure there there's going to be crisis sure they are you're going to get sick i didn't get a i didn't get a stamp on the bottom of my of my foot i'm amazed i was able to do that there's no stamp down there it says will not have cancer so stamp down there will not get covered no stamp there but he said i am the lord that healeth thee [Applause] all of your diseases they meant to heal my hamstring after a while [Applause] now understand you're not some frivolous little church you're the final voice to the final age you're his workmanship brother branham called you that god built you when he was created he built you he thought of you before the foundational world help me now [Applause] he thought of you as an individual he took your picture i've said it before you're standing in a congregation of 200 people take the picture you know who you're going to look for first you and none of you think you look good i maybe i misspoke there but but you look for yourself so look for yourself here [Applause] it's wonderful that you find brother branham it's wonderful that you find somebody else but look for you you're in the promises all of the promises in the bible are for you you're his children [Music] hallelujah he's committed musicians can come [Laughter] brother jason berner the other day you called me and said the doctor said i might when i wake up from the from the surgery i may not have a leg isn't it correct your mom your mom called me as well and you know i i'll tell you what it did i went to prayer because i knew the doctor that was going to be in the room jesus and here's what i reminded him of jason's got a lot of work to do in his life and he needs his legs he needs his legs and so i just simply prayed father you're the one that took a picture of him before the foundation of the world and i believe that you can help him through this surgery today when you see him in church he's got his legs
