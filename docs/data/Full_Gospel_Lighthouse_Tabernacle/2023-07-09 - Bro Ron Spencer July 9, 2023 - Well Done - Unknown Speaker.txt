brother Gabriel and Sister Sarah you're uh Uriah has arrived and and so we're just I thought of that name when when they told me what that name was if you'll remember that's what brother Branham said

brother Doug and his family that is fighting a bug and he lost his father while we were away we were able to pray with him just before actually the day before he passed away and just pray that God would touch them in a special way and brother Randy's been in the hospital with pneumonia and brother Donnie is just needing a real touch from God amen amen and soul remember them in prayer brother Mike walls brought us a request yesterday they've been in a building a seven day Adventist and I asked him if I could bring it to you I believe we have power here then we bind our prayers together brother Mike walls is a dear friend a sister Church of ours a church of about 300 people at the seventh day of Venice they've been there for 26 years and paying phenomenal rent there but that church got a new pastor and he doesn't like what we preach and so and so they have Eva they have told them to leave and you know finding a new church in 30 days is really difficult to do but we believe God can help them and so and so I would just it's caused a cause a lot of nervousness and tension there and so you would remember them that God would just be with them in a in a special way and and help them to find a place I'd be kind of like us having to find a place in 30 days and look around kind of difficult to do and so amen so if you remember them in prayer that God would just be with them in a special way and amen we want to greet everybody here and all the streamers as well we want to thank you for your giving and your and your love for to us and your prayers for us why we were aware by the Josh Bennett's dedication and then at brother Donny's dedication phenomenal Services the Lord was with us and God did some incredible things and so we're back home and so we're just thankful for that I want to speak to you this morning started anyway on well done Matthew chapter 25 and verse 21 and then we'll turn to Proverbs chapter 31 10. and um amen we'll read the first scripture and then we'll let you be seated and the Lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant incredible words to hear from God well done thou good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things I will make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the Lord you may be seated Hallelujah Proverbs chapter 31 and verse 10. I want to read not just about our sisters but to the Bride of Jesus Christ a much bigger picture and we're at the very closing of the Gentile dispensation I want to say some things along that line before we get too too far who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband thus safely trust in her so that he hath no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like a merchant ship she bringeth her food from afar she arises while it is yet night and giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens she considereth a field and buyeth it with the fruit of her hands she plant at the vineyard she girdeth with loins with strength and strengthen her arms she's perceiveth that her merchandise is good and her candle goeth not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle in her hands hold the distaff she strengtheneth she stretches out her hand to the poor yea she reaches forth as her hands to the needy she is not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with Scarlet she maketh her self-coverance of tapestry and her clothing is is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the Elders of the land she maketh find linen and selleth it and delivereth girdles unto the merchants stretcheth strength and honor are her clothing and she she rejoice in time to come she opened her mouth with wisdom and her tongue is the law of kindness she looketh well to the ways of her household when the Edith not of the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he prayeth her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellus them all favor and deceit is beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates that's what God says about this precious woman brother Branham says an invisible Union to the bride which is one of the most Cornerstone messages of the hour he said what a glorious opportunity that we have to speak to a dying people it's a great time we're enthused about it we know that history is closing out the world's history will soon be over and then we're going to step into a new day to that great millennium as a one believer I believe in the Millennium a millennium reign with Christ A Thousand Years upon the Earth the physical return of our Lord Jesus to take a physical people glorified by his cleansing blood what an incredible statement he said Christ was the Living Word he's always what's the word he is still the word he always will be the word he was only the manifestation of the attributes of God for he was the son of God and any son is the attributes of his father and just as you were in the genes of your father in the body of your father when he was a young man you were in him yet he could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the betting grounds of a mother Ada Judah Uriah but then through the betting grounds of your mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become the image of your father then he could fellowship with you and so so were you the sons of God and Daughters of God before there was ever a moon stars or a molecule you were Sons and Daughters of God for you are the only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in God at the beginning Luther couldn't say this Wesley couldn't say this but your messenger speaking to the final voice to the final age could tell you that you were the you are the physical attributes of God that God thought of before the foundation of the world that puts you in a special place now you don't know nothing about that neither did you know when you were was in your Earthly father but you are manifested into his image and then the image of God you are made and you're manifested for the glory and The Fellowship Of God and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before the natural father your spiritual Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world no way around it brother Brandon was not talking about a Physical Realm now he's talking about an eternal Realm now there's no way around it he says now we notice then that the life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world how many wars how many plagues how many earthquakes how many natural disasters you're not here by an accident there might have been a lot of turmoil that has went through your life but you're not even in control of your own being quite a statement you made last night you're not even in control of your own even your own destiny we make decisions we make choices we we think we're in control but let me just say in this little realm of life if you live to be a hundred years old in this little realm of life we make decisions that take us one way or another but the greatest decision we can make is that Eternal one gain the whole world lose your soul brother Ben will use this term he said God's like a great contractor when he was making the Earth he said he said he laid the the potash and the calcium and all the materials that would build your body he knew where you would be birthed that he knew he knew everything about you he he took a picture of you before the foundation of the world he said it's like a contract to the layout two befores and he'll he'll lay out the the materials for the house to be built he's got an idea because he's got a blueprint and then that blueprint he begins to work and the ground begins to be prepared and then the foundation is laid and then then as it begins to build and then then inspectors come to check to make sure it's okay and then it's just built there's a lot of things that go into it different ones will come to work on that and then you know you'll stand back and there will be a there will be a time to where you can say it's done and you know what a great thing it is because you get under such anticipation especially after the sheetrock is put up you think we're just so close you're really about halfway foreign am I talking to you you're really about halfway and then then there's a lot of things that got to take place and then the painting is done and all the trim is done the cabinets are placed the plumbing is finished and every all the electricity is done and and that and all the Heating units are just in the right place and and the carpet is laid and the wood is laid and you know and then you begin to think about you know the finishing touches then you go back and you look at the little dings and the knocks and the little paintings and the change things that you want to change and everything that is just right let me just say God's been watching over this project he's been watching over this project a long time and there's nothing out of cater when a prophet is standing there and I think about when he's speaking the spoken word is the original C look back no other no other philosopher no other Theologian ever preached sermons like that you came out of all different kind of denominations and had all kind of flavors but never a man was given the opportunity to speak the words of eternal life sure there was a lot of people sitting in those audience that just passed it off and just went on about their business maybe you were invited to a meeting and and you and somebody invited you to service and they walked away but your invitation you came and heard the word are you with me it's like I met a man from Singapore and and they were he was in the military and he was invited to to to go to a meeting and deep call it to the deep and and he was invited to go to the meeting and watch this the prophet that was there and that man that invited him he went and didn't say he said well ain't nothing there for me and the guy that was invited said that's a prophet that's a prophet let me just say this to you for the seed of God you know when you look at it you go well it may not be good for you but it is for me it's eternal life now now let me just say this to you there's a lot of times that people come along and struggle with it for years and then all of a sudden the light comes on are you with me maybe you've battled and you've had a lot of questions and you wrestle it with it you wrestle in its own mind you know I always think about this we in our feeble I'm 61. we in our 61 years of experiences think that we can wrestle with the mind of God really really we're so green behind our ears we don't even know if it wasn't God's grace and mercy oh brother I want to argue with brother Branham let me just say it's too late I I want to argue with the message it's too late and by the way there's not another messenger coming it's too late there's not an if this message didn't catch you or it's too late you prepare for the tribulation period if this message doesn't get you ready for a Rapture you need to be doing some preparation for Americans you need to be getting ready for bombs to drop this week was enough to tell you that we're so close to the coming of the Lord we're so close I don't have time to go into it but we're so close your your senators and your representatives are calling for for the Ukraine to become a NATO Nation that's the very reason there's a war and now it looks like Russia is going to be Point Blank against the United States of America we've been knowing that for 58 years we had tomorrow's newspaper given to us so this is no place to stay [Music] brother Brandon stood and it may have been a difficult thing for those denominations to hear Full Gospel businessmen almost every denomination especially in our area every denomination came to those meetings and sat there and listened it may have been difficult for them to hear but we've come to the end God showed us his signs he stood there and spoken word and then he stood there in the seals and revealed the book every mystery was revealed and then he began to tell you you're not a church [Applause] you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and your bone of his born in your life of his life and he began to tell us that it's God at work preparing you and if he's watched over your seed since the foundation of the world and he's got you here that means that there's work for you to do now I I want to just go over a few scriptures and I want you to think in an eternal realm and then the realm that you're you're in now the scripture says in Isaiah 54 and verse 17 no effort that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in the judgment Thou shalt condemn you will judge the Demons of hell because of you are who you are if Satan knew how powerful this group and groups like you around the world if he knew what a position that you really had he would leave you alone 100 percent of the time because you're going to send him right straight to hell I say that very delicately but that's what God built for him and that's where he's going and that's his future now Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6. being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you now notice these next words will perform it it's not like our our government maybe if lies God the Eternal God that said let there be a son now what was the results of that a son Let There Be Moons and stars what was the results of that a universe that we look up and it's God's first Bible so when God speaks it there may be some time before it's developed but you can take it to the bank Hallelujah Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13. Philippians 4 and verse 13. I want you to read this with me if you're the physical thoughts of God now there's work to do I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me let's not talk about brushing your teeth that's not talking about your natural deals but if God says it and I've got to fulfill it he will give me the strength to do it are you with me that could go a lot of directions there Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand Against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places your Wars not with one another let me just remind you it's the devil that will try to get between you and your wife your brother your sister or your your neighbor trying to cause things to cause your mind to be afflicted he'll steal a week from you over just a few words of conversation he'll knows that you're living in a body that's not born again but there's a holy ghost on the inside of you that is takes dominion over your flesh and if he can just raise that temper upper raise that old Garage chopper raise those old memories up he'll destroy weeks of your life over nothing have you ever heard that statement Much Ado About Nothing I was in a brother and sister's home where I was I was there and and I could tell that there was tension in the room and I was eating some cereal and you know and they were sitting they were elderly coupled and they were sitting there I mean literally they fell out of heaven right on the earth and I mean they're just awesome awesome people and I'm sitting there and here he set him aside of me she's setting across it's about a maybe a four by four table and you know I walked in the room I've got to preach this morning and my children are downstairs you guys were small and we were downstairs and you know I I said okay okay what's all the tension in the room about these angels he didn't mow the yard right he didn't mow the yard right What mattered what matter does what does it matter it's going to grow up and it's like a bad haircut in two weeks you do it again next week you'll mow the yard again when it rains it'll grow up put a little fertilizer on integral we were getting ready to go to church it's been a few days over this yard how many is punching each other right now we allow very temporary circumstances to baffle us I want that to sink in just for a moment brother Wayne was preached the other night and you know I think about when you know maybe a year from now I'll be preaching a certain meeting you know God orchestrates that you know and maybe eight months ago I was invited to brother Josh Bennett's and you know you know Seth and Sarah Beth set the date and I'm going to be here on Friday night I'm going to I'm going to drive down there on Saturday morning be at the meeting and brother Wayne is going to speak and he comes right to the end of the service and now God's got a word for me you ever said in a service and then all of a sudden you know okay now it's me and God it's now me and God now you know now it's not Wayne and God and Wayne and me and now it's me and God and so I'm sitting there and then he begins to speak on being afflicted in this body being afflicted and living with an affliction and that Affliction sometimes lasts your whole life and he mentions brother Tim Pruitt and how he was afflicted as a child with those crippled feet and brother Tim stands there and he's had a phenomenal amount of operations on those feet and those feet so weary weary him that's in the background that he has to wrestle with and he still stands and he preaches a couple of hours and and people miss the point two hours and he's preaching all of his mighties give his whole life and you're only getting a glimpse of all the studies he's made in his life in that particular night and yet he's wrestling with his feet Paul had the same issues heif was afflicted for this thing he besought the Lord Thrice that it might depart from him and then God spoke to him and said but my grace is sufficient and then then he just turns and brother Josh is sitting there with a his father he's fought a kidney stone now for months months he's fought this kidney stone brother Josh has taken pain pills and several of them just before the service and you could just tell he was a little bit hazy in his thought process and he was sitting just there and then he's then he's listened to this sermon and the statement was you're Afflicted but you're not defeated you're talking about a phenomenal word from God listen God owns it all God could have stopped it in a moment but he allowed your flesh I'm going somewhere here now he allowed your flesh to be afflicted but that's not the Eternal part that's not the Eternal part of you your body the worms will eat you up they won't crawl from another place they're in your body so when you die those worms come to life every one of you full of worms I don't care how much castor oil that you drink Connie [Applause] every one of you are full of worms the moment your body begins to die after 72 hours those worms on the inside of you begins to eat your body brother Ron that's nasty brother random said you watch that girl twisting down the street he said you watch don't lust after her she's full of worms reason that's so real to me my daddy would tell me Ron don't you look at that she's full of worms I finally married a girl she's full of worms [Applause] and then he brought me up on the stage and they said here's a man with four stage cancer listen I I don't know if you've been to the doctor and the word see has came out of that doctor's mouth but let me just say when it's you you know you can pray for hundreds of people through your life and then all of a sudden you're the one in the are you with me and all of a sudden he's saying you've got cancer and now it's more than an if they did the test now they've pulled the the cells out of that cancer and they tell what it is now you're on chemo now in three years of chemo three plus years of chemo you know you're in a battle listen you know that you're in a battle but listen in my perspective I just move forward if Satan could have killed me he already would have [Applause] if he could have we already would have and listen let me just say I'm not the only one under a death sentence you are too foreign would destroy you because you destroy his atmosphere if you only knew what Satan was trying to do this week to you this week to you he would have destroyed you this week but God preserved you or brother on it does Justin seem like anything that's Supernatural is going on really really he's armed all of hell to come against you he's got every tick tock he's got every Facebook he's got everything that he can to bombard your mind and you still come to church as though nothing's going on [Applause] what have you overcome just to get here things you have no idea about in that same service I was sitting I was sitting kind of on the front row Where You Are and I was sitting in the meeting and there's a girl playing the organ and I'm just sitting there as innocent I can be I'm enjoying the service I'm not preaching I'm enjoying the service and as I'm sitting there the Lord speaks to me and says you'll pray for her tonight and this is what I want you to tell her I can't make that happen I I can't let me just say I can't make that happen so I sat there and brother Wayne finishes and then one by one people begin to come and I'm helping brother Wayne and the other brothers pray and we're praying for one by one we watch things as they begin to happen and we probably paid pray for 15. and I turn in there stands that girl and so I just let brother Wayne pray I let him lead her lead in prayer we prayed for you know she was she was there and I called her by name I said I told her I said before before the prayer line started the Lord spoke to me that I pray for you and you're here and this is what the Lord told me to tell you here's a woman that has fought kidney disease for years incredible amount of kidney stones passed through her kidneys incredible disease that she has fought and I told her what the Lord told me to tell her she danced all over that building it didn't have nothing to do with the disease it had to do with the Eternal part of her life it had to do with the question about eternal life I feel like shouting girl danced all over that building she went to the doctor maybe on Tuesday maybe Monday I don't know for sure and I I haven't looked back at the text listen the doctor called her absolutely totally free so I declare to you we can walk into the building one way and walk out of the building a complete different way Hallelujah [Applause] did that did that eradicate all of her problems the enemy don't give up on Saturday morning she's an ER with a UTI completely unrelated she's healed but here's the enemy he's not just going to quit and roll over I was prepared to preach at brother Donnie Reagan's I'm going to skip but I went home after the service that brother Josh's let me just drop this here and I thought well I'm prepared for in the morning I was he had to get me there so I went to bed and at 12 o'clock he woke me up and said this is what you'll preach tomorrow complete different thought well done and I studied from 12 o'clock to two o'clock Connie's in bed 12 to 2 I go to bed at four o'clock there's some more Touches for it so I'm back up for another half an hour I go to bed I go right back to sleep I'm a good sleeper I go back to sleep five o'clock I'm back up and working again then I wake up at eight o'clock and I'm too late you can't win gotta pack all my clothes I gotta get everything ready now I'm nervous I I made everybody for breakfast in the morning and I'm going you know I'm late they said it won't start till you're there the lady at the at the table she's waiting our table she's just a really kind wonderful person she starts talking to me like she's known me all of her life I've never seen her before I've never stayed in a hotel before and she begins to talk to me about my family wow that's pretty impressive but she was just a people person calm me right down God knows exactly what you need in your moment then I go to brother Donnie Reagan's and the Lord begins to deal with me for what I've got is not going to work and he begins to deal with me that Jesus is coming to your house I want you to think about that just for a moment brother Brown says indoors in a door I'm not going to get to my thought here for a few moments but he said if the queen would come to your door you'd be so excited you'd do everything you could to take care of her if the president would come to your door listen I don't care what what his thoughts would be but he came to your door you'd want to you'd want to fix him the best that you could fix him you won't even sit him in your chair you'd you'd want him to enjoy the moment that he's there but a greater than a queen and greater than a president brother Bram said Jesus wants to come to your door he wanted to come to laodicea and they didn't want him but there was a group of people that said come on in our house come on in our house brother Ron how do you know they don't want him they make rules and every year their rules change and they argue about the rules and when Jesus wanted to come they've changed the word so much he can't even identify with his own scripture that's why when he sees you he sees himself your amen should have been better than that sister Erica Parker had came to Saturday evening's meeting and her request was when the Lord comes down in the prayer line I would like to be when he comes there into Pearland not being selfish but I want to be there when he's there not just when preachers are there but when he's there so we had brother J.D Whitson which will be here in our Labor Day meeting standing behind me and brother Donnie's words to me said when you feel it's a good time for Erica to come will you will you send JD to come get her the prayer line was going on and I don't know how many we had prayed for and I turned to Brother JD and I said Now's the Time brother Tim Pruitt and myself were sitting at breakfast the next morning he said how did you know I said I saw him there he said you know I I can feel him but I don't see that and he said what did he look like and I said it looked like a man taller than us but look like a man like a white figure standing there listen you can't make that up and I don't care what the critic says but without him we can't do nothing we're commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we're commissioned to lay hands and anoint with all and and they'll be healed listen moments of time let me just say if it's just a second or if it's a minute we need to capture everything that there is about that moment are you with me now my mind just goes a lot of places brother Frazier was praying for brother Abby in the veterans home and when he was praying for him there was two women came and said will you pray for my brother and and and they told him said now listen listen man of God is going to pray for you and you're going to get well never been in our church it's never been heard of brother Homer preach but you're gonna get well and and brother Homer literally just anointing with all and prayed for him just a prayer and then and then then went prayed for brother Abby and spent time with brother Abby about a two weeks later he goes back and brother Homer looks over the bed is empty he said he must have passed away he said oh no after you prayed for him he got up and went home brother Abby was a phenomenal man God rescued him in the middle of a of a war with their submarine going down let me just say that predestinated seed is the Eternal part of you you may go through a lot of difficult things when God came down to job when God came to job had the days that me and you'll never fight me and you've had some incredible days but we never had days like job had he lost all of his wealth he lost all all of his children he lost his health his wife turned against him his friends turned against him and then God came he always comes in trouble he'll come don't you worry he's never too late and God came to it listen it's not a time to be fussy with God and God came to him and when God came to him God never talked to him about his balls on his flesh he never talked about his finances he never talked to him about his children is God concerned about all of all of your natural things he knows he'll take care of that he knows he'll take care of that he owns the whole world he'll take care of that glad in this infinite mindset I'm going to restore your children I'm going to restore your wealth you're going to be much richer than you ever was your wife's going to get over her problems all your critics are going to make be made Liars God knew all that but he didn't tell him [Applause] he talked to him about the Eternal Realm where was you job when I made the when I made the foundations of the Earth where was you at when I created it all when I spoke it into existence where was you at he was reminding him that job you was in me job you're not you're this may be your temporary part of your life but you was in me when all this is over listen when God raised up Lazarus and brought him back to this realm Lazarus had to die again you know the story wasn't over that he just went floating through the iron Lazarus had to get sick Lazarus had to go through turmoil he had to listen to the political problems and listen all the nonsense he had to listen to the wars but he had been in that Realm he was never scared to death ever again I hope you're getting this job when the sons of God shouted so God took him before the foundation of the world and then he took him to the end now can I make a Quantum Leap brother Branham is questioning have I done anything for God if you'll think about the time period brother Steve of were he's actually thinking now there's a rejection going on about his ministry is a rejection you felt some of it yourself you handed out books I don't want that but they did yeah they did God sent you to your job with a burden on your heart for a certain individual and God had seeds that were hungry this would be generational did that mean your problems was over did that mean you'd lose your job no the purpose was done now I got to move you but the Eternal part of you was settled it was settled what does that say about what happened there listen the songs that your sins are more than songs I came out last night and you were standing there singing and I thought about the big picture I thought about the big picture in your life I'll never forget a very hard time in your life and I walked past you at a table and it was full of drinks and you was embarrassed about that God spoke to my heart that's my son I didn't talk about the nonsense to you I didn't talk about the difficulties of your life God dropped it in my heart that's my son and if he's your son if you're a son of God you don't have to worry about the little temporary things God's got it shout out [Applause] foreign I was sister Delores you're involved in this I was on my way to Canada to preach three meetings for brother biscoll and brother Tom the first meeting was courage the second was go wash and the third was take it back and you call Connie and told her get a ticket and be with brother Ron he's going to have news we feel like he's going to get a call and then we don't want him to be by himself is that right any of you that's ever flew knows it's once you once you you can't hardly get on the same flight once it's right up to time Connie made the call literally like the day before and said this is our situation we had three flights each way and God arranged it that she was able to sit beside of me all six flights because he knew help me now he knew she would be there and need to be sometimes we think about the impossible things with God there's nothing impossible five minutes before we were to leave the hotel room I get a call and the call is you have a tumor in your lungs we believe it to be cancer let me just tell you that hits you like a ton of bricks but God spoke to me said what are you preaching who are you preaching for brother Briscoe had had an interview with Charlie Mitchell at the Roanoke television broadcast and Charlie and brother Ed sat there and did a 30-minute interview never had to take a break and the producers at the television broadcast said this never happens when we do advertisements when we do political interviews we have to stop and start over stop and start over stop and start over to make sure that we get it right and you two men one from Canada and one's from West Virginia sat down and began to have an interview and you go 30 minutes without a break and brother biscoll just looked at her said we're telling the truth [Applause] and Charlie Mitchell had a tumor in his lung and he said when brother Branham called him out he said I saw an eye coming at me I grew up under his ministry he said I I saw an eye coming at me and it wasn't brother Brown he said but I saw an eye coming at me and he told him where he was from where the tumor was go home you'll be well when I walked in that pulpit I had a confidence if God had me here in British Columbia and say preaching with a man decades ago that had that interview then God had my situation that would get much worse under control [Applause] okay on time I always like to watch for results you're here because of results you're here because of results God speaks it then there's results happen you're here because of results I never forget the world of fire that came down over you I came to you remember that you know nothing about what we believed but there was something on the inside of you that it's real you're not sitting back there you're up here feel different the meeting was over it was quite a group of people that was in brother Tom Ray's Church in his house I know I was just standing I was standing against the fireplace to stand in there brother Murphy who is the mouthpiece to China That's translated over 500 messages maybe 600 by this point who is the William Branham of of China and I just kind of feel like a small small boy compared to what his ministry has done and I'm standing there with him you know God's not really intimidated by putting you under pressure now I'm at my sermon I won't be much longer God's not intimidated by putting you under pressure and I saw a vision and I said Murphy I see you with a baby well he was thinking it was about himself no brother no his children's grown no brother no no no no no your daughter they didn't know that was impossible for them to have children you know we rejoiced we stood there and rejoiced it you know we talked about it and others came over we talked by the time and I talked months would pass by I'm in an office with a with a doctor and the doctor explains to me how terminal I was he said do you understand terminal because I don't think you understand do you understand terminal I said I got a good idea do you understand it well you know that kind of those kind of conversations are real difficult to have and so I'm sitting sister Connie has an appointment so I'm sitting in the car waiting on her to get out of her eye appointment and I'm sitting in the car and I'm just kind of thinking on my mind's just kind of whirling and I'm sitting in the car and Murphy Wong calls me and he calls me and I look that's interesting and his daughter had just been told it was impossible for her to have children and I said well brother Murphy here's the deal I just came out of an office where they told me I was terminal and you're telling me that your daughter it's impossible for her to have children I don't believe this is just an insignificant call I said but if God's going to heal me I believe that and if God's going to have showed us that you're going to have a baby I believe that right it's that in between details now I'm preaching it's that in between details that Satan Wars in your mind because you're a human but it's the Eternal part and that little girl that little baby had to come because she was written in the Lamb's Book and all of Hell couldn't stop it I'd say this all of hell can't stop you if you are predestinated sin how many meetings has Satan had in his realm after meetings that we preached and one come to the Lord another gets healed another gets filled with the Holy Ghost sister Connie do you know can you imagine how upset Satan was when you God begins to deal with you that you got to be in that service that Aaron is preaching unbeknownst to us as Humanity the difficulties I don't know the background but let me just say this to you God's God knows the temporary but God's interested in the eternal when I saw her I never seen it done before I never thought about it being done but I as a preacher I pull my coat off and wrapped it around her Andrew said you know what you did when that father son came home he took the best robe you walked into a very natural service but a very Supernatural happening takes place will there be trouble absolutely will there be turmoil absolutely but the Eternal part [Applause] I want to say this and this may be a hard statement for you to listen to I will go on the 20th to the doctors then I will go in August to the to the brain doctors and if they told me that I was one hundred percent without cancer I shout I dance I would scream it for the rest of my life but that don't mean I won't have more problems that won't mean you won't have more problems God totally heals you totally saves you totally fills you with the Holy Ghost don't mean that you won't have more issues just take brother Homer brother Homer preached he built this building he had incredible visionary incredible visionary but I was with him he had incredible problems one day we were with a tractor and we had problems he always had trouble with that tractor brother Thomas we had trouble with trying to hook something up we had incredible issues we got across the road in a tire went flat I'll never forget his response in spite of all the Devils doing he's not going to make me mad he's not going to make me mad listen it took an hour or so to fix that tire take it off it's front end Tire take it off take it and get it fixed put it back on but he's not going to make me mad you've had days that it looked like the whole world's falling up I'm talking to you now the whole world's falling apart but if you can look at the Eternal Realm we're not wrestling against flesh and blood into things that are here we're wrestling against principalities and powers and he's done everything that he can do to stop you from coming to church this light on you is cheated on you he's done every kind of thing that he can and you still come because you're not the one holding on you're not the one holding on he's holding on to you [Applause] quite a statement the end of the day whether by rapture or whether by Death this temporary life comes to an end I'm not discouraged in any of that that you know Spurgeon said don't worry about your end just worry about where you're going to wake up it's a pretty good statement I want you to think about how God got you here and sometimes we question God's never did a miracle for me I'm going to finish with this and start up next week or whenever I'm going to preach again but I want you to think about this well I've never seen a miracle brother Ron you are a miracle who are a miracle Devin you're a miracle you're a miracle not a doubt in my mind your family said she'll never last you had thoughts in your mind Satan did a lot of bombarding to her but let me just God ignores all your problems of your past because he knows your future [Music] well brother on if I was tall dark and handsome I'd be somebody you know if I look like this or look like that we're not here to pattern after Hollywood we're here to be like God well brother on I get so discouraged with the dress code Eddie listen it's God's thoughts it's like we're not here to pattern after Sodom and Gomorrah at the end of the day we want to go hear him say Well done I could care less what Hollywood thinks of us and the government thinks of us and the school thinks of us I want to hear God say Well done [Applause] but I had to clean out all my music great I had to clean out all of my britches I'm talking to women I had to pull out all my britches and all the nonsense in my bikinis and throw it away God I had to throw The Honky Tonks away glad I had to throw my dope away Biden we see you throwed some dope away too that was just convenient I didn't pre-arrange that that was just convenient but it was good it was good it was good my brother Ron I had to get rid of this and I had to get rid of my pornography and I had to get rid of all the gossiping and I I had to get a new mind I had to get a new tongue a lot of stuff used to come across that tongue when I get mad a lot of stuff fall out of there I'm talking to you I know where you're at I live with you I know where you're at here's where it is some of you been here since 74 73 and you think well God's got to be done with me by now now no he well I don't need to hear all them sermons okay okay I got to you I got to you now there was a man asked Michelangelo when he's working on a certain piece of art so what do you see in that rock he said well Moses is sitting there he said I don't see him he said well how do you know if you're getting into Moses he said well what I'm doing is getting the excess off of him [Laughter] now you know when he first started out great big chunks fell off but he got down to where there was some little bitty rocks and then he had to not take a chipping hammer no more but it had to take five and then he had to take a certain type of cloth I'm looking for something else but I'm not finding it screened like a screen somebody some somebody's a contractor Terry tell me where I'm tell him tell me what I'm looking for here he's got to take something to scrub that edge off planer that'll work now you know if you're a casual Observer you go wow that Moses looking good but you wasn't there you weren't now when it started out why Moses looking good he's looking really good I see him but you didn't see him why when it was a great big rock some of you came in here 40 years ago and you were a big old rock and Homer beat on you for a while scrubbed on you a while you pulled your toes back up under the seat for a while you had your name called you got mad you got frustrated why me and then a redhead shows up and because of you I did great [Applause] because God's just not working on you he's working on me that's good ain't that good and the guy behind me is redheaded but he stays around you long enough the stone that the builders rejected they looking for everything else a lot of people have rejected Christ and they turned him down but it was a keystone it was a keystone brother Ron when when will God get done Rapture morning not a doubt in my mind on Rapture Mourning you and your wife might have a tiff maybe you had a tip this morning before you came to church and you came to church and you said in your Pew maybe somebody else got you a seat and that caused you to have another teeth reserve seats here and then you know Matthew sung a song that you didn't know the words to why did that why did that girl get to sing and she sings well done God orchestrates it don't worry about it Jesus shows up exactly on time now let me just say the miracle of getting you here and spending 40 years with you to shape you he didn't do it just to waste his time got a whole book of troubles that you've had you've got a whole book of troubles that you've had and you could now you could send a whole book in of all the things that you went through in your life and it don't even matter the wrong way it's like getting a bad haircut it grow out next Saturday will come and if it don't come you'll be shaking hands with people that we long to shake hands with I want to finish this because I didn't finish it I actually preached one page today so that was nice wasn't it you know I I want to please I want to please you as an audience I really want to please sister Connie 40 years she got the ring for putting up with me I really like pleasing her I really do I really do whether she knows or not I really like to please her I haven't pleased her a whole lot but I've really you better try to please Gabrielle too you know but there's times that we won't please one another am I talking to you human beings David am I talking to you about it yeah but there's one I want to please there's one I want to please when brother Branham had his hands behind his head and he said I haven't done anything for you and the Lord didn't come down and remind him of all the things he had did he took him on a trip would you like to go beyond the curtain of time I'd like to go and the reason that God had to take him beyond the curtain of time because there was incredible words that needed to be preached and he needed to see that Eternal Realm so that when everybody turned him down he would know that part is already taken care of he would know without a shadow of a doubt as if Paul was if Paul was if he was given eternal life I preached the same thing Paul preached and when he sees all those people that have had incredible problems but they're there do you know that lady that just walked up and hugged you no I don't believe I do you led her to Christ when she was past 95. don't give her a hit don't give him a history lesson of what she was like on Earth but he shows her to him in an eternal Realm and then will I be judged for what I've preached well if so and I'm paraphrasing if so I preach what Paul preached I preached what Peter preached and a group of people screamed we're resting on that now God don't just see you here but literally a few feet from you you girls especially there's an there's a theotheny body that's there to watch over you because Jesus said let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe us in me I go to prepare so he's got a body already waiting on you so in this realm we sure want to please one another but there's another Realm that we want to hear these two words said well done brother Timothy I want to pray with you this morning I want to pray with you Sister Amy if you'll come with him for the Chris if you're coming brother William you guys are coming to help me pray amen sister Cassie if you'll Place something then maybe a little worship song amen I've talked to you about your temporary but God's already got the Eternal part taken care of but the temporary marries a whole lot in this particular moment so God spent a moment to tell you all done [Music] could we just pray
