Oh, the victory is mine. Oh, the victory today. It is my my will I told Satan you better get me behind because of victory today it is mine. [Music] Amen. You can be seated. I'm going ask brother Marcus if he would just come sing for us. Amen. Then after him we'll have brother Matt Mccclure take it. I hope this can come out. I've got a confession. Hold on to your seats. But it's weighing on my heart. And after brother Matt asked me to sing and he sung that song while ago, Falling in Love, I knew this was supposed to be said. So I hope I say it right. I'm coming up on eight years since the Lord called my son home. Many of you know the testimony of our our sister, my brother, the tragedies. And I remember going to brother Reagan's he coming up on eight years and brother Louie reached out to have me sing a song and this song crossed my mind and this is my confession. I couldn't sing it. It's crossed my mind many times and you all know it. So I hope when I try in a moment you'll sing with me. And that is when the Lord takes me. The first thing I could only think of is I want to see my son. God, if if you've read my testimony in the book, God did many things for me to prove that he's there. I'll never forget that morning I sat in brother Reagan's office and he looked at me. He said, "He's there. It's God's servant and I know he's there." And all I can think about is hugging my son. So the song Jesus is what makes it heaven for me. It's my confession. The Lord already knows my sorrow for feeling that way. But I wanted to say it today that I couldn't sing that song cuz all I could think is, yeah, I love the Lord, but I want to feel my David hug again. I want to see him first. I'm ashamed of that, but I'm honest. I've got some integrity. I'll tell you straight. And as time went on, I I grew up in what we call a holiness church. And I'm not passing any discredit to any of that in the past, but I'm just my testimony that as an adolescent or young teen, we learned of the prophet and we learned of the ch church ages and we learned of the seals and the serpent seed. But I never learned to love God the way I've learned in these last eight years. When I look back and I that day he drugged me out of an ocean that I was gone and in my heart I said bye to my family. Pulled me out of that car called DOA operic down. And when I reached suicide losing my family and my child, he reached down and all the things he did for me under brother Reagan. And then I got here and he reminded me that 22 years ago I was on a plane that brother Ron knew he'd meet me again someday and he'd take over the reigns and help lead me. And I tell you that don't make you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I my son could look over the portals today and I believe he could. I think he's saying I'm going to hug you too, Dad, but Jesus is what makes it heaven for me. I've heard of a land that is wondrously fair. They say that it splendor is far beyond compare. In that place that's called heaven. Oh my soul longs to be for where Jesus is, it will be heaven for me. Let's all sing it. Oh, heaven for me. Oh, heaven for me. Oh Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. All its beauty and its wonders all I've been longing to see. Oh Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. Oh, if walls there weren't jasper, and if the streets were not gold. Oh, if mansions would glisten. Oh, and if folks still grew old, still I'd see everything I've been longing to see. For if Jesus is there, he'll make it heaven. Sing it with me. Love him. Oh, heaven for me. Oh, heaven for me. Oh, Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. All its beauty and its wonders I've been longing to see. Oh Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. Oh heaven for me. Lord heaven for me. Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. All its beauty and his wonders I've been longing to see. Oh Jesus will be what makes it heaven for me. [Music] [Applause] Ain't it good to be a Christian? &gt;&gt; Everybody love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; I got a good friend in Kentucky that says, "I say Jesus, you say Jesus." So, I'm going to say Jesus. Y'all say Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are you happy to be a Christian this morning? &gt;&gt; Do you love the Lord with all your heart?

I'm an overcomer by the blood of the lamb and by the word my testimony. Anybody got a testimony this morning? We got some testimonies here this morning. All right. How about if I share a little something this morning? Last night I you you saw how I was nervous like ever before and I battled with one quote in particular about we're battling with blind spirits. &gt;&gt; You you remember the quote I I told you to pay real close attention. Sometimes you start talking through scriptures and a man of God doesn't exactly know what he's doing, but he's just following the leadership of the Lord. And I fought so hard about putting that quote in there last night. I fought so hard. Even back there in the back, I was just so tore up about it. And I said, "No, God, you you dropped that in my heart. I'm just going to I'm just going to drop it." And I realize now what it was. It was Satan battling me because we got a testimony in here. &gt;&gt; We got a testimony in here. Because two years ago, Brother Teddy went through a camp meeting there in Louisiana and he wanted his healing in his eyesight. He come out of that meeting and he crushed he crushed his glasses. Said, "I'm done with these things." I want I I respect a man that's got that kind of faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's that's powerful faith right there. But yet he still he his eyes were about perfect except for one eye. Correct. Well, last night while the Lord was moving, Brother Teddy got his complete healing last night. Anybody else got a testimony this morning? They want to thank the Lord for that's no small thing. God honors our faith. Key of F. [Music] Oh, as I look out across the land, I see God's mighty hand.

And he says these words and they're so profound. only one life to live and it will soon be passed. What we have did for Jesus is the only thing that's going to last. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Matthew chap 28 and verse 18. I want to announce my text this morning and I don't want you to get carnal with me. But the time we have left to live and brother Matt McClar said anybody can preach this sermon. I can preach it. But all of us are terminal without a rapture. &gt;&gt; All of us. All of us are terminal without a rapture. We came we came from the dust of the earth and to the dust of the earth we will return. But we become more conscious when we begin to fight heart issues or or cancer issues or begin to take chemo. And and and and we have taken chemo for five years now. And and um and uh this subject came to me on Monday morning. And uh so here we are. And every one of us have to look at the days that we have. And so I I want to share a few thoughts that are on my heart with you. Matthew chap 28 and verse 18. These are the last words that will be with Jesus in two passages I'm going to read. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I command you. And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. We know that baptism was in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to Acts chapter 2 and verse 38. Acts chapter 1, he will speak again. And when they therefore were come together, they asked him, saying, Lord, will thou at this time restore again the kingdom of Israel? Now, I want you to think about it. They have seen the resurrection Christ, and they're still thinking about him going to be the king on this earth, but he didn't come that that time to be the king, but he will come. And he said unto them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in his own power, but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come unto you. And you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth." And when he had thus spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. I can not imagine the presence that they were standing in. While they looked up steadfastly toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood stood by them in white raignment, which also said, "Ye men of Galilee, why stand you here gazing up into heaven? The same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven. You may be seated this morning. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. I was I was just I was just impressed yesterday morning to share a couple of stories with you. We are we're preparing to go to brother Tom Rays, brother Bisclls, brother Michael Rays to for their for their camp meeting and we've been invited we've spoke that several times now and brother Andrew and brother Matthew are going to be there with me and speak in that meeting as well. And sometimes the new ones among us don't quite understand connections or how we're connected and but we're connected by the message of the hour &gt;&gt; by a supernatural realm of of what God has done for us in our lives. And so I I in 1978 sat in the meetings that brother Biscllow would preach here in Virginia and he would tell he would tell about brother Brandham and their stories and he would once again do that in Lime, Ohio. Then he would do it brother Tim Fruitz and of course he would do that at at his own church. Through the years, I began to be known to brother Biscll and we begin to be friends and then it was at the meetings at Billy Andrews that every year at the Thanksgiving meetings and that was my mother and father's anniversary and so they would attend that meeting and we would attend it as well. Then he would preach at brother Henry Greens and brother Dan's and then brother Joe's later at the camp meeting there that the mission meeting that's getting ready to go on here in a week or so. And so he would preach those meetings and then of course he spoke here several times and and he just phenomenal services that we had here and then we would be at their place and then at brother Tim Puit's place and we would have quite a bit of time together. one particular occasion uh maybe about 15 years ago uh he called me one morning and he said, "Brother Ron, I' I would like for you to come with me and speak at Switzerland and I I'd like for you to do that and come every year and be with it with me and speak those meetings." And and I'll be honest with you, I had no illusion that I would do that. And I just told him, I said, "Brother Biscll, I I I definitely can't do that this year. I already have meetings planned. And he said, "So plan next year to to come to the meeting." So we were there about nine I'm I'm thinking nine years together successfully one back to another. And we would see a lot of supernatural events take place. And in those in those meetings and one right after another through the meetings and through the times that we would have and it was just glorious times. &gt;&gt; Amen. He came to a spot in his life to where that he would have a he would have a heart attack and and u and so he would have a heart attack and they were going to have to do open heart surgery on him and it was a midday for us and our me and the boys were together and we was in a was actually in a pickup truck and he said, "Brother Ron, I'm sitting on the side of the bed and I've got some decisions to make. They're going to do open heart surgery." He said, 'I'd like for you to pray for me. I believe God would speak to me and give me strength in in in the prayer. So, we begin to pray in the truck. And you could feel the presence of God just drop in that truck. as we were praying and we were praying that God would anoint a doctor to step forward. Maybe even not even a doctor that has been on the scene, but another doctor that would step forth &gt;&gt; and and he would be anointed for the challenge to help brother Biscll that this surgery might be easier. Not going to tell the long story, but the very last day he had been attended by a lot of doctors, but the very last day, a doctor from either New Zealand or Australia was in the in the building and he came in and he was a young man. He came in and shook brother Ed's hand and he said, "I'll be doing your surgery today." And he said, "Now, I don't do it like a lot of other doctors do it. Other doctors take your heart out of your chest and work on it." He said, "But I have a new procedure that I do and it'll be much easier on you and and and you'll be okay." And he remembered that prayer. This is exactly the prayer that was prayed. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The next time I was at brother Bisclls and and he wasn't supposed to be moving about, but he couldn't help to come but come out and have dinner with me and share those things. It was things like that that we watched through the years that were supernatural events that linked us together. &gt;&gt; A lot of things and to which I'm not really going to go into, but God links us all together. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has a way that the Holy Ghost can move and shows us in supernatural ways that I'm with you. I'm in all of this. A couple of years ago, the family of brother Tom Ray was with us and the all three boys was here. All three of those boys were supernaturally born because they couldn't have any children. So they would go to brother Biscll and say, "We would like another child." And so every time they would go, God would somehow in his supernatural thinking would bring would bring those children on the scene. And so and so anyway, they were here. The Lord had spoken to me before they came because I thought of it deep. God, you're in the arrangements kind of in the arrangements of maybe why you're here today. God don't do anything accidental. &gt;&gt; He's not just moving things around just to see if he can move these around. And so all three of the boys was here, their wives. And that was quite an incredible thing to to be able to get them here, their wives, and some of their children was here. And I was just praying and I was praying about it and had great thought. I what what is this all about? And the Lord spoke to me and said, "Deliver these words unto them." And so, and so anyway, the meeting came. We had a lot of fellowship together. And then, and then we found oursel in the living room between between Brother Andrew's house and my house. And and it was just just the right arrangement was there. Sister Connie was in the kitchen. And so, well, I begin to share with them a story. I looked at this and and God is in the details of having you all here. And so, I just shared with them that the Lord spoke to me to to share some words with you. I didn't know how powerful they would be. But when I shared these words with the family, the Holy Ghost just fell. It just fell in the room. And when it fell in the room, those boys went on their knees and weeping and crying out to God. One of the daughter-in-laws, one of the one of the grandchildren's daughter-in-laws received the Holy Ghost. Sister Connie was in the kitchen. She be to worship the presence of the Lord. When they went back home, Brother Sam was he's a businessman. When they went back home, him being a businessman and in some in some of the words that was said to him that God was going to bless them and he's going to supernaturally bless them. He went back home and I believe it was the next Friday. He got a call and there was there was a man that had three businesses that was linked that they did some work together and he said, "I don't know why that that I'm even calling you, but I'm calling you. I want you to bring your checkbook to my office. I'm going to sell you three businesses today. Now, we're not talking about small stuff here. &gt;&gt; This is the kind of stuff that you would think about taking months to consider, but because of the the the what was spoken to him in the living room and the power of God fell, God worked out all the details. We were in Switzerland. Hope this is okay to tell. We were in Switzerland and I was speaking a sermon called what will you be remembered for? And let me just let me just say this before I go any further. When we tell these stories, remember this. I can do nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am only the instrument just like these guys are &gt;&gt; through which God can use. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen. &gt;&gt; It's all in God's control. &gt;&gt; And I was speaking a sermon on what will you be remembered for? And let me just give you a little background. I had become so sick in Switzerland. &gt;&gt; It was the sickest I'd ever been as far as throwing up. This is before cancer. Throwing up, it was uncontrollable. I called Connie in the middle of the night, which which would be late evening. I called her in the middle of the night and she heard me. She heard me doing all of that and I said, "I just need help. Get the people to pray for me. It's in the middle of the night. Nobody's up. I'm so sick. I can't even go out into the hall. And we begin to pray together. And Brother Glenn Grunert came to my room and knocked on the door and said, "Brother Ron, I felt impressed for you to to come and knock on your door. What's going on?" &gt;&gt; And he brought me a bottle. I I should have a bottle of that now cuz it could cure cancer. So by the next morning it was as though it never happened. And so I went but I was weak and I just asked that I could trade a service and and so one of the brothers was so graceful to to trade a service with me. So I would speak on Monday morning which would be the last service of the meeting. And so, and I spoke that sermon and in that sermon, God was just moving in a very in a very special way. And Brother Biscll said, "I I've got to get to prayer. I've got to get to brother Ron to get to prayer." And so, and so he said he compared that meeting to another meeting. I'm not going to share that, but and so anyway, he &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I prayed for some on the stage and then and then I just disappeared. The deacons came and got me and I I prayed for I think it was brother Joshua Vanderbront and he just he just collapsed on the floor. And then as I stepped forward, Brother Biscll was with his wife and his daughter and he just shared what he needed and he said, "I've been working on a project for 12 years and he said, I've got the best of the best of the best trying to perform this project for me." And he said 12 years we have not been able 12 years we have not been able to form it. I want you to pray. We prayed and as we prayed the spirit of the Lord dealt with us and as we prayed. He went back home and about three months later he called me and I was walking on my driveway and he said, "Brother Ron," and he was excited, "Brother Ron, I've got to tell you something." He said, "You remember when I came to you at Switzerland?" I said, "I do." He said, "Do you know we'd worked on that for 12 years and it was impossible to make happen? Just impossible to make happen." He said, ' Did you know I got home? It's 90 days later and it's over. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, we serve an incredible God. &gt;&gt; An incredible God. &gt;&gt; How many on the YouTube has seen Brother Biscll interview Charlie Mitchell? Brother Charlie Mitchell was a preacher that I grew up with that operated brother Falter's church and also was a pastor in a place called Coburn, Virginia. Does anybody know where Coburn Virginia is at? Sure you do. You're from that you're from that country. And brother Charlie, brother Charlie was the kind of guy that he was the kind of preacher he called himself a shotgun preacher. He said, "I'll just shoot all over the tree. I know I'll get you. And so anyway, I I witnessed him one night. He was preaching and there was a baby that was screaming and crying and screaming and crying. That was before nurseries and uh Yeah. And so there was screaming and crying and Charlie just went and got that baby and he preached with that baby in his arm and that baby was as quiet. No, I'm not going to come get your baby. [Applause] And you can keep your squeaky toy, too. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, children disturb me." Well, you know, go to an old folks home. You'll appreciate kids. So, so anyway, Charlie had had cancer in his lung and brother Fulture took him to brother Brandham's meeting and so they couldn't get a prayer card, so they sat in the very back of the building. I heard Charlie tell it over and over again in the back of the building. And so, he sat in the back of the building. They were disappointed. They didn't have a prayer card. Actually, brother Falter and brother Charlie was separated sitting in the back of the building and here he had a tumor on his left lung and and he was up to die. He's up for an operation. You know, back in those days, they just didn't give you much hope at all. And so he was sitting in the back of the building and and brother Brandham begin to discern and he discerned one. It was right in front of brother Charlie. And then brother Charlie said, "I saw an eye about that big staring me down." And brother Ramon began to discern, "Brother Charlie, and you have a tumor on your left lung. You're not from here. You're from West Virginia." The doctors and they begin to go, he went right down the line. Precise, totally accurate, exactly right. Go home, be well. &gt;&gt; Well, he went right back to the same doctors. And when he got back home to the same doctors and they began to take the X-rays all over again, Brother Charlie was 100% healed. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Biscll, this is in the early days. Brother Biscll came to to Virginia to the meetings and he took brother Charlie Mitchell to to um to one of the uh television broadcast. And so and so anyway, they went there. They went to the studio. They had set it up and they went there. They sat down and all the lights were on. The cameras started rolling. Brother Biscll introduces Brother Charlie Mitchell. They start talking and they're 30 minutes exactly to the tea. Well, they had just had a politician there trying to do a minute commercial and it took them hours to do a com a minute commercial with that politician. And here, Brother Buscoll comes with brother Charlie Mitchell. They sat down and they tell the story. 30 minutes right on the dot. It was over. And the director said, "We just had a politician here and it took him hours to do a minute commercial and here you do a 30 minute interview and you don't take a break at all." He said, "Well, the difference is we're telling the truth. [Applause] So &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; So I I I'll jump through a lot of stuff. So the first meeting the first meeting that I will speak is at brother Bisclls and brother Tom Rays after I received the diagnosis of cancer was in my lungs. We didn't have it that was in my brain yet, but we had it that was in our lungs. And so they said he'd be getting an important call. Five minutes before brother Tom would pick me up, I got the call. That night I would be preaching on courage, not knowing anything. And I'm preaching in brother Biscll's pullpit with cancer in the lungs. And I thought, how fitting that God is. I was raised with the man that did that interview &gt;&gt; that was healed by being in the meeting with William Brham and here I am speaking at brother Biscll's on courage &gt;&gt; and they're giving me a terminal diagnosis cancer in my lungs and in a few days it will be cancer in the brain. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this God's in control. when he begins to leak up friends and neighbors and from across the world. &gt;&gt; Without this message, we would not have known one another. &gt;&gt; But God had a book. He knows exactly how to release your seed of life into the earth. &gt;&gt; You'll not come a day early &gt;&gt; or a day late. He knows exactly because in God's pre-planning, &gt;&gt; he knows you've got to be born under a certain, don't get lost here, under a certain zodiac sign &gt;&gt; that will form your nature &gt;&gt; and not out of bounds. I'm right with the message. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly because he knows he wants you a certain way. &gt;&gt; Don't never get discouraged whether you're too tall, too short. Come on. &gt;&gt; Too small, too fluffy. &gt;&gt; Whether you're a type A personality or whether you're extremely quiet, &gt;&gt; some will dance and shout. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Some will scream and turn quiet wheels. &gt;&gt; Others will stand still and tears will run out of their eyes. It's all God's planning. He'll have us all born under in a in a certain way, in a certain place. &gt;&gt; Your mother will eat your body out of the ground of the earth. &gt;&gt; I find it amazing. I'm off target topic now, but Brother Brown said, "She'll eat your body out of this cursed earth." Amen. &gt;&gt; God knew the potassium that he would put in the ground. He was preparing you &gt;&gt; when he was saying, "Let there be." &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I think about an amazing God &gt;&gt; that had us to be a born in this certain age to believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; We could have been born in Luther, but that wasn't our time. &gt;&gt; We could have been born in Wesley, but that wasn't our time. We could have been born in Pentecost, but that wasn't our time. &gt;&gt; You remember the life has to come through the stalk. &gt;&gt; And and listen, they were they were phenomenal revivals that God was with them, &gt;&gt; but they could not believe in their denominational system that the life would pass, &gt;&gt; right? And they would constantly be trying to you ought to have been here when it happened or trying to rebuild that revival or try to relive that revival. But once it passes, &gt;&gt; once that life travels through, it travels and it'll never return to that. &gt;&gt; Now even you every day is important. That's the theme of this sermon. &gt;&gt; Every day that you live is important. &gt;&gt; Now, I read a statement the other day that says you may not control everything in your life, but you do control how you live the day that's in front of you. your attitude, your disposition, your faith in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job would begin to say things like this in Job chapter 14 and verse 5. Now we're beginning. You can set your clocks now. You can begin. See, and his days are determined. God knows exactly how long you'll be here. &gt;&gt; The number of his days are with thee. Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass. Psalms 39 and4. Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure of my days, what it is that I may know how frail that I am. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, when you're when you're 18 years old and you're full of strength, &gt;&gt; you're full of you can run like a deer. &gt;&gt; You got a lot of strength inside of you. You You think I'm going to live forever. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're out of bounds. Well, Brother Brandon said he was sitting at the table and he looked up at his daddy, right? &gt;&gt; Had those curls in his hair, those strong shoulders. He said, "My daddy will live forever." &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham couldn't understand as a little boy what the cycles of life was. &gt;&gt; But but years later, he would hold brother Brandham in his arms or he he'd hold his father in his arms and he would expire from this life trauma event. Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 27 says, "And as it is appointed unto men &gt;&gt; once to die, and after that this the judgment." There's only a couple places in the scripture where this don't work. Lazarus came back, &gt;&gt; but he had to die again. In Proverbs chapter 27, do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what that do day may bring. Psalms chapter 39 and verse 4, show me Lord my life's end and the number of my days. Let me know how fleeting my life is. David was asking these questions. And I know some of this is from a different translation, but you just hang with me. Galatians chapter 6 and verse 9. Let me let us not grow weary in welloing. For in the proper time we shall reap if we faint not. &gt;&gt; Philippians chapter 1 and verse 21. For to me to live is Christ, but to die is gain. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; You're familiar with this quote. Brother Rand will say this. He says, "As you begin to see the days of your life drawing close, then it begins it begins to you begin to pack up closer getting ready for that great event. It's a continuing of this life. life in another world, another place. Then he will say this, your birth here was pre-planned. &gt;&gt; I guess you believe that. I absolutely do. &gt;&gt; Every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned. Did you know that your being here never originated as a myth or a thought? Everything was all pre-planned by God before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; That you would be here. The infinite God knowed. &gt;&gt; The infinite God knowed. And to be infinite, he had to know every flea that would ever be in the earth. How many times it would bat its eye. Boy, he went to the extreme on that one. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's infinite. See you, our little minds cannot fathom what infinite means. The infinite God, he knowed all things. &gt;&gt; When God said, "Let there be." We was in his mind. &gt;&gt; When the clinker of the earth fell off of the sun, we was in his mind. Before anything that was ever formed, we was in his mind. &gt;&gt; Before he was even called God. When you buy a used car, it's one of the greatest gamles you'll ever make in your life. &gt;&gt; When you buy a used car, no matter what it is, you're only buying what's left, the life in that car. &gt;&gt; Now, that car may have been $140,000 new. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it's got 120,000 miles on it with Katie driving it, &gt;&gt; you would not be a good businessman to buy that car. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; To buy that car at its original price. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you want it at an extremely discounted price &gt;&gt; and then you want a good mechanic &gt;&gt; cuz now you're the individual that's going to have to work on it. &gt;&gt; Well, what's buying a car have to do with me sitting here today? &gt;&gt; You've only got so much life left on your speedometer. Are you with me? You've only got so much life on your adometer, &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, but I'm going to live forever. I don't know what you've been reading, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I I don't know exactly what you've been gobbling in, but I don't care how many &gt;&gt; OS that you have. herbs that you have, &gt;&gt; vitamins that you're taking. &gt;&gt; When you pass 21 years old, you start dying. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham had doctors. Talking to those doctors, he would ask them, said, "I eat the same thing that I ate as a boy." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, you eat better. Now you got money. So you you eat the same thing. You you drank the same thing before you were growing &gt;&gt; and you thought about I want to be 6' tall. That was a dream for me. If I can get to 6' tall somewhere seven inches didn't come. &gt;&gt; So I had to be satisfied with running behind guys like this as a running back. But I want you to understand now you're eating the same thing that you did. You're trying to eat better, but it seems like as you progress in life, you're getting weaker. &gt;&gt; Your muscles are deteriorating. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would would begin to, you know, think about. Brother Brandon, I've been around this forever, but Brother Brandham, when he when he got near 50 years old, he had some sort of a complex that he felt like he was an old man. Now, you guys that are 85 here today, when you were 50, you felt like you was young. You would look back on it say, "Well, I was young. I was young at 50." But brother Brown had a lot of miles on his odometer. &gt;&gt; We could say seven times around the world, preaching in very difficult places, huge coliseums that he would preach at to huge crowds of people under extreme pressure. He's just not another preacher. He He's a prophet. &gt;&gt; It's dispensational change time. And he's delivered the word. It's hard on his natural body &gt;&gt; and he's even even contemplating maybe going into the mountains to stay because the pressure was so hard on his body. &gt;&gt; It was difficult on his body and he could see his end coming. &gt;&gt; He could see I I can't do this forever. I can see my end coming. &gt;&gt; And in doing that he would preach sermons like sers is this the time? &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. He would preach sermons that would begin to grip what that what that clock is doing to his life. &gt;&gt; I wonder sometimes if we feel that way &gt;&gt; do we stop and understand as that clock is ticking we will not relive yesterday. I want to drop a couple of very simple principles here. &gt;&gt; You won't relive yesterday. &gt;&gt; What Satan beats you with in your past life, it's gone. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ has taken care of it and it's gone. &gt;&gt; It's over. &gt;&gt; Can I say it? You can't relive it. You can ask God to forgive you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And God will wipe away and then there's no more condemnation to the them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; But you can't do anything about yesterday. But you can sure take care of today. Brother says, "God be an infinite who cannot lie. He He cannot speak anything that's contrary. He knows everything. And just as perfect at the beginning as he is at the ending and just as perfect at the ending as at the beginning, God's endless like eternity." He said, "You can never find the corner of God's perfect circle. You can run and run through the ages and eternity, but there'll never, never, never, never, never, never, what a stress, be an end to it." &gt;&gt; That's the way God is. It's mindblowing. And and when he be first that was and which always was and was infinite perfect to begin with, he'll always be the same. He'll never change. &gt;&gt; He's perfectly the same. Notice these words. Now this great chain of perfection was broken by time space. time can because of sin. He said, "Let's draw a picture. It's a picture a picture of a perfect circle. However, forever forever, forever and then all at once sin dropped in." And then my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop in the chain. And so it comes down. Eternity continues on, but it's not in its perfect condition. And here's a little gap that comes down and breaks over this way and goes out this way. And God had to do that because Satan caused it. &gt;&gt; And it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and for the perfecting and for the purging of the lost. Goded by his sovereign grace might someday lift that little hickey back or gap back into a perfect circle. Then when the roll is called up yanda, it'll be just the same time. Now time in this little loop, it loops around and Jesus was Jesus was from eternity to eternity. But he stepped into a space of time and was made flesh and came here in order to sanctify and put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it &gt;&gt; and to connect it back together. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he connects it back together, it's for eternity. &gt;&gt; Makes a statement. He says, "You stepped out of time. You stepped out of eternity into time." It's just like a couple. You step out of eternity into time and maybe you can't figure out why you even fell in love with each other. &gt;&gt; Why did she marry that guy? Why did Dorothy marry Matt? Amen. &gt;&gt; She's a such a calmnatured person and he is a red bull in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But they stepped out of time, out of eternity into time. But that's not the end of it. They stood and got married. They had children. One of these days, they'll step back into eternity again. &gt;&gt; But while in time, God molded character here. &gt;&gt; It isn't just for no reason at all. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It isn't for just no reason at all. God's shaping character. As the prophet said, we're invited to shape our character to his character. &gt;&gt; This is the only place that's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Listen, your character is not developed in rapture morning. Your character is developed in your whole life. &gt;&gt; And listen, we got work to do. &gt;&gt; Why am I still here, Brother Ron? You got work to do. I've read this several times, but I want to read it again today. Choice is huge. It's absolutely huge. Lot one time had to make a choice. It may be this morning that there will be men and women sitting here that'll make your final choice. You are today what you are because several years ago, you chose to be what you are now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's pretty big. &gt;&gt; You are what you are right now because several years ago, you chose to be what you are now. &gt;&gt; Now, let's take that a little further. And what you chose now will determine what you'll be five years from today. &gt;&gt; Five years from today, you may be a missionary. Five years from today, you may be a renowned Christian. Five years from today, you may be in hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. My brother who is a minister as well had a man sitting in his office and this man was cussing him and making all kind of challenges to him tell him he was going to kill my brother. My brother couldn't do anything to calm him down. He just was at a total loss of trying to call him calm him down. That man made all kind of threats. He walked out of my brother's office said I'm going to go home. He went home and that's the last time anybody heard from him. A few days later they found him. He committed suicide. My brother was left with the with the pain of what could have I done different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What could have I done different to cause this man to think about his life? &gt;&gt; But listen, that man chose that. You're choosing today what you'll be next week. &gt;&gt; You're choosing today what you'll be next year. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Well, brother, it's up to the pastor. Let me just say we preach the word. &gt;&gt; And you're making a choice how I'm going to receive it. &gt;&gt; Even sitting the building, we can sit with a critical spirit &gt;&gt; and the enemy will cause us to miss the whole thing. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; He builds preachers a certain way to get to certain people. &gt;&gt; And God develops men to be able to deliver the word of life. We're go not going to marry you. We're just responsible to preach to you. &gt;&gt; We're your spiritual cheerleaders. Come on, let's finish this race. Paul would said, "Let's press the mark." &gt;&gt; He would say, "Let us run this race with patience." He's telling us, "You've only got a few minutes left or a few days left. Run, &gt;&gt; brother, I got a bucket list that I'm trying to do. I I got to go here and I got to go there and I got to go over here. I want to see the tallest mountains. I want to go to the oceans, to the beach. I want to see this animal. I want to see that. Let me just say what should be number one. &gt;&gt; Serving Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Making 100% sure that the wedding garment fits. &gt;&gt; Some of you that have got married and had huge weddings. You don't a week before the wedding go, "Well, I better get a dress." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You that's got married, you know how that works. Months come and you've got an idea how your wedding should look like and you're you're beginning to think, I I want to look a certain way. and you go to a certain tailor, you go to a certain person that could make sure that your dream becomes reality and that dress is what you're looking for. Well, you know, the groom on the other side, he just he just needs to wear clean pants. You know, you know, he may decide on a suit or maybe a tuxedo and he rents it. Now, I I listen, there's a lot of things going in that office right there on wedding days. We should have a bag of bobby pins back there. Pins that'll make things tighter. But I've also seen suits that Hey baby, you're not going to get in that. And all the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to get you in that. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this. When it comes to this rapture message, You can't feed on all the nonsense of the world &gt;&gt; and get in the dress. &gt;&gt; Well, Ron, I need a quote. Okay, I'll give you one. I'm going paraphrase here for it because I don't have it here. Elisha, Elisha, the robe is going to be handed down to him. God didn't trim the robe to fit Elisha. &gt;&gt; He trimmed Elisha to fit the robe. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? This bride must be trimmed. &gt;&gt; And arrayed in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Listen, God is going to have a life. &gt;&gt; I I don't know where you're at in your walk with life, but God's going to have a rapture. There is coming a resurrection with or without you. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting on the fence. You better get off. &gt;&gt; You better get busy. &gt;&gt; Every sun every sunrise is a gift. I'm sorry if I'm drinking Coke here for you, but my sugar is crazy today. But every sunrise is a gift. Every heartbeat is a blessing. &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we think, I'm I'm going to put some things off. I'm gonna put some things off. I'm not going to serve the Lord now because I'm too busy &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; Listen, this is not the seals, but it'll get you to the seals. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I was stepping this I was trying to get something deep. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is deeper than a lot of you guys realize &gt;&gt; cuz a lot of you wasting days and wasting time. &gt;&gt; You're just you're you're just not taking time seriously. You're not taking you seriously. &gt;&gt; Not that you're not taking me serious. You're not taking you serious. &gt;&gt; You're the temple of the living God. Treat yourself that way. I'm not talking about other people treat treating other people. You need to do that as a Christian. But treat yourself. &gt;&gt; And if you will treat yourself as if God lives on the inside of you, you won't watch the wrong things. You won't listen to the wrong things. You won't participate in the wrong things. &gt;&gt; Well, go deeper. Okay? You won't carry that critical spirit. [Applause] You go somewhere and get rid of that jealous spirit &gt;&gt; cuz you can't be you can't be a Christian carrying jealousy &gt;&gt; and bitterness &gt;&gt; and pride. &gt;&gt; You've got to get rid of it &gt;&gt; and replace it with love and joy and a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Fall in love with Jesus. But this is the way my family was. Break the cycle. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm doing what other people do. Other people may not be going in no rapture. &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. I have this crowd has changed over and over again. But I want you to understand I just keep preaching the same message. &gt;&gt; I just keep preaching the same message. God's going to have a wife. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There's going to be people here that believe this with all their hearts. &gt;&gt; But I had I've had a lot of goats said here. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to per personalize that. I've had a lot of goats said here. I preached the word to goats &gt;&gt; and they buted their heads and they had all kinds of opinions. Listen, your opinion don't matter to me. None whatsoever. &gt;&gt; Your feelings does not matter to me whatsoever. I keeping my eyes on the master. [Applause] and he swore by himself. Brother Brandon says this, "You're here to fulfill it. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. We got some teachers here in this building and I want to tell you my hat is off to you guys. I would not trade jobs with you for all the money in the world. Because no matter how good you do &gt;&gt; or how difficult you do, you're going to have complaining parents. And there's going to be people complain here the day after the rapture. &gt;&gt; You thought I'd quit preaching. We're going to have people here complain the day after the rapture. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron didn't get me ready. [Music] &gt;&gt; Sweetheart, let me just say this to you. You got to get ready. [Applause] You've got to have a powerful family at home, &gt;&gt; not just here. &gt;&gt; The work that you do at home. Church starts at home. &gt;&gt; You can't fuss and fight all week long and come and sit beside each other and hold each other's hands. &gt;&gt; You might get an Oscar for that. This ain't the place to make up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You got to pray together. &gt;&gt; You got to read your Bible together. &gt;&gt; You got to love one another. Come on. Somebody ought to be helping me preach right here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother, that ain't spiritual. Oh, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he come in and he could feel the friction in the house. He could tell that she was upset. You know what he did? He went and got an apron. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And started singing a song. And he began to wash dishes. &gt;&gt; He didn't give her scriptures and quotes. &gt;&gt; Most powerful preacher in the world. Doesn't use no power. He washed the dishes. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, how do I cast the devil out of my wife? He said, "Well, might want to give her some roses." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Might want to give her some chocolates. And I've said this before, sisters, if your husband this week sends you roses and chocolates, &gt;&gt; you might want to ask him, "Do you think I got a demon on the inside of me? [Applause] walk unconscious of criticism. Now listen, that's huge. &gt;&gt; That's huge. We just we just remember a couple weeks ago I I talked to you about keeping your your spirit clean. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a bigger sermon than you think it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this one is too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you will get it tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk unconscious of the world. Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not paying any attention the right or the left. Just keep walking on. If something comes up in the church, walk with God. &gt;&gt; If your sickness strikes you, walk with God. If the neighbor don't like you, walk with God. &gt;&gt; Just keep walking with God. Don't let your world fall apart because of the doctor says you got cancer. &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Random said don't fear it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? But it's in my family. Heart's in my family. So I'm worried to death. I'll get it. Even if you get it, walk with God. Are you with me? Remember this. You were walking with God the day before the appointment. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, the chemo just destroys my day. No matter how bad you feel, get up. &gt;&gt; Walk with God. Enoch one day walked like that. You know what he did? He walked all the way home with God. He got so far up the road he didn't want to come back anymore. Walk with God when the doctor says you're going to die. Walk with God. The doctor says you can't get well. Walk with God. Are you getting the picture? &gt;&gt; Just walk with God. That's all. For God has promised you, I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; I'll never forsake you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Even to the end of the world. He took an oath and by a covenant that he give you that he would confirm it. Just walk with God. &gt;&gt; Someone walked to the altar last night and said, "I'm so nervous. I'm so tore up. I'm so I you know, I I don't know. I may be I may be mental. I have a mental illness." And I said, "What you need is peace. &gt;&gt; What you need is peace. It don't matter what the doctor says about you. You just need peace. &gt;&gt; Some of your homes need peace. &gt;&gt; Some of your children needs peace. &gt;&gt; No matter what you're fighting, you need peace in your life. &gt;&gt; Quit beating yourself up. &gt;&gt; You need peace in your life. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. She wrote me a letter this morning saying, "After you prayed for me, it was a wave of peace came over me." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "You're going to have your ups and downs." Being a Christian does not exempt you from having ups and downs. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Your checkbook's going to get low. &gt;&gt; But it would have got low if you'd have been serving the devil. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I just don't like paying my ties. You already did when you was in the world. &gt;&gt; You played You paid Bud Michel &gt;&gt; Miller. &gt;&gt; You sucked it in a straw. I never done none of those things. You went to Baltimore and watched the baseball games and paid $500 to watch your team lose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil takes more than 10%. I want y'all to know right off of the bat, God's a good God. &gt;&gt; The devil may tell you different, but God's a great big God. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I lost my job today. Don't worry. McDonald's is hiring. &gt;&gt; Bies is hired. $25 an hour. &gt;&gt; I see these guys with these signs and they're smoking a cigarette. They look healthier than I look &gt;&gt; and want just a little help. A little help that I could give them is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother, do you ever give them money? No. No. But I have told them find Jesus. &gt;&gt; Cuz my idea is they're going to take that money and spend it on beer and alcohol and drugs. &gt;&gt; They're going to be right back here tomorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they stop they stop volkswagons. And I'm not going there. &gt;&gt; But you're going to have ups and downs in your life. &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you the difference. He's going to be with you. You're going to go through some brier patches, over some sharp rocks, over bluffs, down over the hillsides, up through the mountains, over waters, but God will be with you. &gt;&gt; There's so many hills that you're going to have to climb. I got a list here I'm going to give you in just a minute. And it seems when you get to the end of the way, oh my, just look up here there. All that's that's been look back at your footprints. It won't seem very much. Now, sometimes we think, well, I've been in a real trial. I've been in some difficult situations. We celebrated my 25th anniversary of preaching to you, but I've actually been preaching since 1983. &gt;&gt; During that time, I've had a couple things happen to me. Maybe you don't have a list, but I just wonder, do we get mad at God &gt;&gt; when something happens? Do we get frustrated when we get over one trial and all of a sudden? &gt;&gt; Here comes another trial. You mentioned a couple things last night. Didn't know it was in my notes, but you know, I fell off of a house 40T, landed on concrete, and they said I'd never walk again. My dad walks in and prays for me. And I remember his prayer. He said, 'Father, I am your son and you gave us authority to pray for the sick and this is my son who is also your son and you spoke to me on the way to this place and said he will walk out of the hospital. They are saying he's paralyzed and never walk again. But you said Amen. &gt;&gt; But I am not in a wheelchair today. &gt;&gt; I got up and walked out of that hospital that night. I laid in in RMH with eight days with a stroke. Could not stand the light. On the last day that I was there, a girl came in at three o'clock in the morning and she went. When she came in, she come around the bed. She said, "Mr. Spencer, are you awake?" And I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said, "They have told me that you're a preacher." I said, "Yes, ma'am." She said, "When I walked into the room, I felt a presence." &gt;&gt; I felt the presence. Have you been praying? I said, "Yes, ma'am. How far away is he?" I said, "He's right here in the room." &gt;&gt; She said, "I need Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need Jesus. I took her by the hand and I began to pray for her and I heard her weeping because it was dark. I heard her weeping and crying. And she said, "I'm giving myself to you today. Father, forgive me of my sins." Let me tell you what happened. I'd been eight days and couldn't stand light. And instantly after that prayer, everything was well. &gt;&gt; God knew there was a predestinated seed that was there. &gt;&gt; And I had to be there on the eighth day that I could meet her. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody help me preach. Your trial is not in vain. The things that you go through is not in vain. &gt;&gt; There is a rainbow that will form after your storm. God made the promise. [Applause] I was burned in an explosion. My arms burned, my face burned, my lungs burned, basically destroyed. The doctor said I wouldn't live. On the worst day, brother Biscoll called Sister Connie and said the Lord spoke to her to him that I would be the speaker at the next Mount Baker camp. You talking about going out on a limb, you better know it's God. That was the day that they gave me up. But God had more plans. I want to tell you, God's got more plans for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got more plans for you. Jumping from that story to here, we have fought cancer for five years, over five years. I asked a doctor the other day, I said, "Where am I at in my walk with this?" And he said, "Rephrase it." I said, "Where am I at? Am I coming out of the woods in this journey? He turned his recorder off and he said, "Ron, you're not coming out. You're in the middle of the forest. But I want to tell you, keep walking." &gt;&gt; Aren't we frustrated with God when we have issues? What are we going to do with today? &gt;&gt; What are we going to do with this afternoon? What are we going to do with tomorrow? &gt;&gt; What's left of time in our life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's left? Maybe there's chapters left. Sister Wanda, you can't look at this as the end of the trail. &gt;&gt; You got a lot of You got grandbabies to take care of. Brother, I don't know if I can make it through chemo. I want you to understand if you got God with you. &gt;&gt; If you got God with you, he'll help you. &gt;&gt; You having trouble on your job, God will help you. Young people going to school. You may get frustrated every day you're going through it, but God will help you. Your friends will see the light around you. &gt;&gt; You may think you're not getting anywhere with them, but they'll look back and see you as a real Christian. &gt;&gt; Not something phony, not something made up. &gt;&gt; But if I ever met a real Christian, Brother Ron, I just have so much trouble. Okay, I got a quote for you and I'm gonna quit. Brother Brandon must have felt like this a day or two. The devil hates me. &gt;&gt; The devil hates me. And I know he hates you, too. &gt;&gt; And he's my enemy. Boy, I want it like that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; But as long as God is my friend, &gt;&gt; I don't have to have no fear of him. Won't you look over at your neighbor and tell them, "The devil is my enemy." &gt;&gt; And this may be the only time you'll ever use this word in this church, but I want you to tell them, "I hate that devil." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hate's a strong word, Brother Ron. You need to be teaching love. I hate the devil. &gt;&gt; I am not on his side. I never have been. I never will be. And I never in the future. The devil hasn't got one legal right nowhere. &gt;&gt; He's just the devil. &gt;&gt; And it's a password. That's all. He hasn't got no legal right to any man. They'll accept the promise of Jesus Christ. He's whipped. &gt;&gt; So why are we afraid of him? &gt;&gt; He's whipped. &gt;&gt; He's been whipped a long time. &gt;&gt; So when he jumps in your ring, whip him again. [Applause] Okay. Okay. Well, the devil knows he ain't got much time to work either. &gt;&gt; He realizes he ain't got much time because the book says he ain't got much time. &gt;&gt; So, I want him to know. He keeps telling me I don't have much time. I want him to know. You don't have much time, old boy. morning in hell. What it's likemen, &gt;&gt; Satan has given assignments to the the demons cuz Lucifer can't be everywhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's not God. He be only in one place at one time. So he sends spirits out against you. And all of a sudden, that spirit is assigned to you, Stephen. He's assigned to come to your house. Your house, brother Shannon. Go to his house and destroy his day. I would like for it to be said by the devils. Please don't send me to his house. &gt;&gt; Please don't send me to his house. I did everything that I could to stop him and he just turned and whipped me over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; I get headaches from having to beat on him. I'm wore out when I come back down here to hell cuz he has beat me so bad. I would like for it to be said that we are Satan's nightmare. [Applause] You know what a nightmare is? You go to sleep. You were thinking love of God thoughts. You were talk thinking special song thoughts. and all of a sudden you just slip off into a deep sleep and all of a sudden you find yourself in a nightmare and you can't wake yourself up. It's the most horrible thing you've ever been in. You sweat, you cry, you get all emotional, you tear the sheets up that you've got on you, and you finally wake up and you go, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. That was just a nightmare. &gt;&gt; Finishing with this. &gt;&gt; But Satan can't wake up. So whatever time you got left, beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Beat him. Fight. Fight. Fight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't whine because you've only got a few days left. Go work hard. Get it. Every day is a new day. &gt;&gt; Me and Jesus has got a lot of work to do. Stand to our feet this morning. Thank you for being such an attentive audience. I want to bring a quote to life before I walk from the stage. Five years ago, you were making plans to be here today. Maybe two years ago, maybe one year ago, you made plans. Some of you are brand new. But God had plans for you. And your plans is getting you in rapturing condition. You're walking closer to God every day of your life. You're walking closer to God. What you did yesterday, it's over. What you're doing today, you enjoy. Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't let the day go through and not appreciate the moments that you're living in. &gt;&gt; We've all lost loved ones real quickly and you wish you'd have told them something. &gt;&gt; Don't neglect to love your your your your family and one another. So, I'm going to give you some practice just now. I want you to shake three people's hand and tell them, "I want you to know today that I really love you.
