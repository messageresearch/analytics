you I was thinking about it when they told me you were here I thought about it I thought me and brother Homer were probably some of the reason for your heart conditions how many hot dogs we ate Amen brother Roger's been a friend for those that don't know brother Roger we've got a lot of new ones here brother Roger's been a personal bosom buddy of mine for for a long long time and so amen amen we will be young again together I just wanted to do something just before we before I go into the word and I'm sure you're a patient congregation but I couldn't go to be with brother George during the time of his loss of his wife and so I told him I would share a few thoughts as if I was standing there at the funeral brother Francois I actually spoke that funeral Friday sister Quinn sister Jacqueline went to be with the Lord on Wednesday brother George has been taking care of her for a few years now she has struggled with dementia symptoms and things that have went on and we want to remember brother George for those that don't know brother George brother George has been a buddy of ours since the early 90s when he came into our lives and and we affectionately called him King George I went to be with him in Ireland and a few years back and I you know a man you can recognize who he is when he's on his own turf and so I I was there with sister Quinn's Sarah and Jonathan and then at their church I spoke it's one of the nicest things that I've ever been a part of brother George took me to Columbus house the place where he stood and preached and looked over the cliff and and would preach to audiences down below we had a great time and was in his home with sister Jacqueline fixing meals and she was a real lady she was a queen we would term her the queen of Ireland and so uh we are saddened that she's went home but we're also thrilled amen we're also thrilled she went from a body that is very was very tortured and because of sin's curse we're all going to go there without a rapture and our life is to prove to prepare for that time and so uh brother George we share our love with you you're watching you're actually already watching now and with your family and so we we want you to know our prayers are with you we love you so much I was praying about a scripture that I could could share with you the scripture in Proverbs says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need or spall her husband is known in the gates and when he sitteth amongst the Elders of the land sister Jacqueline fulfilled that as brother George would would be in and out of the home be be on a job for up until in his 60s he would work many different many different types of jobs at the end he was taking care of handicapped children and uh I was with him in Donegal and we were walking the streets and I knew what a great man that I was with by by people that would pass and and stop and talk to him and it was like talking to a celebrity they lived in a farm home kind of a rock-like structure it was a farm that they had many different animals she had tremendous Gardens there her home was quite a wonderful home A Home of love their daughter Sister Sarah and Jonathan they are just they're just examples of what this message is they have helped to take care of Mom and Dad through the years and while he would be away whether it's Vietnam or China or or India or any of the countries that he was at probably the worst of when he was ever at was America and I would say America we have forgot who God is and brother George we would like to welcome you back again they were wanting to come here in January and as they were making plans to come here I just felt burdened on my heart to tell them not to come and uh they actually went to a warm climate and I'm glad they did that and shared with us many many wonderful pictures of of going there and we just we're just thrilled that we've got to know them as she has passed over a queen has went to the other side she stepped from this Mortal to a brand new body she labored here taking care of the home taking care of the farm taking care of our Gardens making sure that brother George was fed properly taken care of no doubt it's a child she didn't realize what an incredible calling that she would have not only to be the pastor of that home pastor's wife of that home but to be a queen when you're born you don't know what your purpose is going to be in life but when she married brother George she married a great man we have loved brother George just over the hill from their home is a is a street that goes by and it would be the same street to which John Wesley would have traveled he would go just up the road to preach in that local church there and we know who John Wesley was but I'd like to say that that street was incredibly important because it carried George Quinn I have the greatest reverence and respect for brother George his wife and their children and their Church there and you know sometimes we look at people because they've got huge crowds and think of what success but in a Catholic country whether you have five people or a hundred people you're incredibly successful he has raised the manner of the message through all of these years and what a banner that he's held up and I would like to say to Sister Quinn well done it don't mean too much for me but well done some words that she said she didn't know that I heard it was after a service that I had preached we went back to the back of the place and it was very cold there in Ireland and the brothers had their coats on one side the sisters on another side and it was kind of like a wall petition there and as I was putting my coat on and my hat on I heard her say something tonight it was as though Jesus came to visit us and he spoke to us I thought those were some of the greatest words that I'd ever heard that Jesus would come to visit us I had a really interesting moment with her and I won't be long but I had a really interesting moment we went to do some shopping and for the girls we got all of our girls uh a necklace what would you call that sister Connie it was kind of a rapper scarf I don't wear them every day so I don't know much about them and she was telling me what was the best fabric sister Cassidy she was just picking him up and said now this is a good one this is not a good one can you tell the difference no but she insisted that I buy that particular kind and I did I tried to buy all of the girls all of our my my family's one I had on my heart to buy a coat for sister Connie it'd be a wool coat be a nice dress coat and it's a blue blue and I was wanting to get this particular coat for her and sister Jacqueline had met Connie many years ago and she was telling me specifically what size that Connie needed well I didn't want to spend that kind of money and knowing that she wasn't going to be able to wear that coat and so she said this is the one you got to have you got to have this one you got to have this one and I I was thankful she couldn't read my mind and so then when I sing that she was so determined I walked through the clothing store which was a nice clothing store and I finally found a lady that was my wife's built and it was a strange request I walked up to her and and I said I need some help and she turned she said what kind of help you need I said I need you to try on a coat and I said I'm saying this in a very complimentary way you're built like my wife I'm not coming on to you but you're built like my wife she came over and was so graciously and and so we put the code on sister Connie and sister Jacqueline said that looks really nice that looks really nice and I'm sorry I was glad that I could please sister Jacqueline as well she's wearing a different coat today and I told that story for a reason she's wearing a different coat her coat today is is a coat of a new body she stands in her theotheny and she can't wait to come back and be with her husband and her family but she had prepared all of these years for this going away you see in God's house nothing can remove your name he designed it all he wrote your name before the foundation of the world he prepares for your coming to Earth and he prepares for your leaving God no absolutely makes no mistakes when it comes to his children he knows the day you'll be born he knows the hour he knows the minute and he knows the hour the minute that you will leave God knows our fallibility so he give us a blood that could take care of that you see God is the architect of this body and the architect of that body one day we'll get a glorious body likened unto his glorious body and we'll never know more part we'll never no more go away brother George I have good news for you she's waiting standing beyond the river and what more could we ask no she won't be in the Who's Who and no she probably wasn't a millionaire but she's got eternity and that's the greatest thing that we could possibly ever have God bless you brother George God bless you Sister Sarah and God bless you Jonathan we will meet beyond the river No More Tears will be there Will Never Say Goodbye that'll never be a word that will ever be uttered there goodbye God bless you brother George God bless you well done sister Jacqueline amen we love your family we love your church we love your people let's stand to our feet maybe you could sing this with me this has been on my heart for a couple of weeks and why should I feel discouraged why should I feel discouraged why should the shy those forms why should my heart and long for heaven and Heaven when Jesus is my portion my constant friend is he [Music] his eye is on the space [Music] and I know he's watching let's sing it together oh I see because I'm happy thank you oh I see because I'm free [Music] his eyes his own despair and I know he's watching me let's sing it again with all of our hearts today oh I see because I'm [Music] happy oh I see because [Music] is old the space [Music] [Music] amen forgive me for getting a rough start on that sometimes your emotions go a lot of different directions and I'm not infallible I have a soft heart too so amen God bless you God bless you remember us this week as we go to Louisiana camp and heard a number last week about 35 is going so I'd like for you to pray for us we never know when to be the last camp that that we will speak and so let's just give it all that we've got and so be a lot of needs come in there and would like for you to remember remember us as we speak brother Donnie Reagan will be speaking with Andrew and myself and so please pray what's in brother Kelly last week awesome it was just awesome brother Kelly will speak this morning and he's going to get in a car and drive 31 hours to be with us and this will be his first experience coming to camp and so amen pray for him that as they would travel that God would just be with them amen amen we're so glad to have brother Chris and sister Cairo what what a wonderful song this morning that she sung and the barfields and so and her his mother is with us and amen we were at Ohio a few weeks ago and as I was I was leaving on Sunday morning and I was just walking out and I was shaking different hands and as I was going out and it just seemed like one one touch after another touch and miracles were happening and and I had just been with brother Ben or Brian Erickson and his wife and had a supernatural moment there as I turned the corner to walk down the hall your mother was standing there brother Chris they placed her in a spot to where that is she said she wanted prayer and they said it brother Ron feels up to it he'll turn and pray for you and as I walked by I just sensed an urgency and she gave her heart to the Lord amen baptized on Thursday this week and last night had a very incredible experience right here Brother Ray you was on one side of this and she was on the other side and I thought last night was so over the top amen amen sister Melissa I prayed spent some time with her and I just you know my heart was I couldn't hardly go to sleep after that and don't worry I can't see it no way and so [Music] as I heard her just screaming out in prayer you were praying with her sister Chastity and and then sister Wanda I thought What miracles has happened among us see don't never take these kind of services for granted it's because we're getting ready to go home that's why we're having services like we long for services like this and now we've spent decades and now we're having them and we're going to go home soon we're going home and so amen amen God bless you we so love you this morning amen thank you thank you thank you I want to I want to share a thought with you today I found a note the other day that just ministered to my heart Trust never put a question mark where the Lord has put a period I thought that was so profound this morning I want to speak to you for I hope a decent time indisputable evidence indisputable evidence we as Christians have an empty tomb we as Christians have an empty tomb maybe this isn't working we as Christians have an empty tomb other great leaders came and had a lot of theology but when they laid him in their tomb regardless of whether it was gold whether it was a huge building where whether it was a sphinx they're still there no matter how many thousands of years has passed they're still there but Jesus didn't need nobody to buy him a tomb he wasn't going to stay long Hallelujah I want to declare to you he's not there but he's risen amen he's the mighty conqueror he's our champion Matthew chapter 27 and verse 57. and when the evening was come there came a rich man of armathea named Joseph who also himself was Jesus disciple and he went to pilate and begged the body of Jesus and then pilate commanded the body to be delivered and when Joseph had taken the body he wrapped it and cleaned linen cloth and laid it in his own new Tomb which he had tuned out in the Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the door of the Sepulcher and departed and there was Mary and Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting over against the Sepulcher now the next day that followed the the day of preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees came together unto pilate I think this is incredible scripture saying sir we remember that the deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days I will rise again command therefore that the Sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest that the disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last era shall be worse than the first and pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as you can what a joke so they went and made the Sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch you may be seated I'd like to start this isn't the devil stupid may not be proper in a lot of places but this week as I was coming to this sermon this quote kept coming to me so I want to I want to share it in spiritual Amnesia brother Branham talks about a water tank we're in the hour of compelling them to come the last ones are coming in the last one it's not Mass isn't coming it's the last ones that are coming in stepping it's a sign to us that we're prepared we're preparing to go home it's not just happening here but it's happening around the world brother Brandon says he says in spiritual Amnesia he said a French soldier I was told of a little story before before we would close this evening he said I didn't know it was even that late and I got about 10 pages of notes somebody told me told me the other day that brother Branham didn't use notes and I just start quickly going through how many pages that he had and he said he got some he said that he said get it some other time he said notice a French soldier they got a bunch of soldiers in in from the Army and they had this amnesia it's from shock on the battle and they had they had a program that they called up and let people who would miss and loved ones to call and see if they could identify these boys no hope for them maybe one or two out of it got caught it and and then they took the rest of them they was going to put them in a sanatorium where they'd stay the rest of their life and there was going up the hillside the train was pulling and they stopped at a station and let the boys get out and stretch their legs and the guards got out on the hill and watched them because with amnesia you have to be watched they have to watch them and so they watched them one little fellow there he got out and he began to look around and he looked at that water tank looked all around over the hill he robbed his face and he studied and he looked again and and he seen that water tank and he looked all around at the station and he started walking instead of the Guard stopping him he followed him he went up over a hill and down a little path and turned to the right and went over another Hill little Hill and he'd come to a little cabin little log cabin and he looked and coming out on the porch an old man with a cane in his hands and he'd come out and throwed his arms around him and said my son I know Jew would return they told me you were dead but I know Jupiter report to return and the boy come to himself in the Amnesia left him he could identify who he was he knowed that that was his father oh soldier of the Cross that's been shot by so much training and so much denominations and Creeds things of the world why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go looking around in the Bible wander around and you might find yourself identified in the word as a Believer one of these days you might not know him you may come to yourself and lack a prodigal son did and find yourself find your identification in the word of God oh hallelujah what a powerful thing that that is brother random says he says in true Easter seal he says and today they're trying to keep their time to keep Christ in the Tomb but oh what an Easter morning done an Easter morning ruined all their theology and when man on Easter morning came forth for a people a church here 1900 years later it ruined their theology he's not dead he's alive forever more they cannot keep him in a no tomb you cannot keep him in a Methodist tomb or a Baptist tomb or a presbyterian tomb whatever you want but he was raised out of that tomb and it's alive today I had a Baptist tomb you might have a Methodist tomb but one of these days Jesus arose you from there from a historical God to a living God a present God he's alive forever more Hallelujah whatever tomb that you was in God has called you from that tomb he said in the face of all of this doubt go God does go right on proving his words to be right as he was in every age unbelief doesn't stop God unbelief does not stop God unbelief does not stop God it doesn't hinder him I don't care how much the world unbeliefs it's still going to happen unbelief doesn't do nothing but condemns the unbeliever but brother Ron we've been so many years since the message was delivered and the prophet went off of the scene where's the resurrection and the Rapture just like last night some of God's kids had to come home some of his kids had to come home they had to identify who they was they saw the water tank and they had to keep going they had to search in the scriptures nothing in the world was satisfying them there's not a not a fact enough alcohol there's not enough adultery there's not enough Hollywood that will satisfy your soul there's nothing in sin it'll only put you in a tomb [Applause] God rich in Mercy when he says Lazarus come forth when it calls your name [Music] Satan is a loser I don't care how much the world unbelieves is still going to happen unbelief does not do nothing but condemns the unbeliever the unbeliever will send the unbelief unbelief will send the unbeliever to hell it'll Rob him of Every Blessing God promised to him but it doesn't hinder God from going right on with the believer unbelief does not stop God we can't lose if you know who you are and you know where you're standing you can't lose Adam stepped out of Eden into a world of sin and it and it actually changed not only Adam and Eve but it changed the whole world sin now reigned upon the Earth but God came our Jesus came to change it all unbelief didn't stop Jesus it was at every meeting the skeptic and the scoffer was ever every place that he preached when men and women were healed the leper was healed he was no longer the leper when blind Bartimaeus was healed he was no longer blind Bartimaeus went at the woman at the well she was no longer the woman at the well [Music] it don't take 10 years to change your life just meet Jesus [Applause] now we think about this being 2 000 years ago but what did every service of our prophets stand their doing he was preaching the indisputable Word of Life seeds were on the earth that would hear the message and become the Bride of Jesus Christ all of the Scott Skeptics of Hell couldn't stop it it doesn't matter what the critic says unbelief can't stop God there's going to be a bride the message encircles the globe like brother George men stand almost in every nation raising their banner and there's people that love this word just like you do [Applause] this message was more than just to be on Book and Tape it was more than to be the voice of William Branham but the voice behind the voice was calling you from that sin and dead life under a resurrection where would you withstand as redeemed sons of God and exercise your authority of resurrection power in this life Satan couldn't hold Jesus and in all of this thinking power he can't even touch Jesus now I want you to grab that the moment he left hell with the keys in his hand he couldn't touch Jesus all of his imps all of his demons couldn't touch him now he can't get the keys back he can't get the arrows for his bow it's an indisputable fact hell is defeated the sickness that you may suffer today and that you struggle with it's defeated the pressure's in this world it's defeated now Satan might be able to touch your flesh he might be able to touch your spirit get in your memory and your conscience your affections he might be able to get there but laying in the third round he can't get to that he can't touch that once God resurrects it and that dormant seed comes to life that God placed in you before the foundation of the world God DNA Notch Spencer aims I'm not talking about that that's his flesh but God DNA g-o-d DNA lives on the inside of you say it with me g-o-d DNA lays on the inside of me and Satan can't touch it [Applause] [Music] he may bet your flesh he may bet your spirit but he cannot backs that Soul down on the inside of you he can put every ounce of unbelief against you put every ounce of Reason against you he can use the best that he's got he can't turn you around it isn't you holding it's God holding it isn't you defeating the devil is God defeating the devil in you [Applause] Isaiah chapter 60 and verse 1. arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee we can say God in you Hallelujah how do I know he lives I can just look around a little while if you could have give up you would have if you could have walked away you would have [Applause] cause you went through some trials that would shake the Thunder out of you but God rich in Mercy when you would have turned loose somebody else grabbed your hand whether you're realizing it wasn't you he was hanging on to you our great Shepherd God had a halt of us when we were going over a cliff he grabbed a halt of us and pulled us back therefore my heart is great glad and my glory rejoiceth My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope I love this next scripture for thou Wilt not leave my soul in hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption Now understand this Jesus is the only one that ever said I have power to lay my life down and power to take it up again a lot of people wanted to cheat death no matter how rich you are no matter what kind of a star you are no matter what your Brilliance in your brain has done you can't cheat death it's part of it but God had a man named Enoch that was so pleasing to God he didn't need a tongue he didn't need a grave but he just kept walking it don't say nothing about his family it don't say nothing about his uncles and his aunts he just kept walking and he so pleased God until one day he walked right off of this Earth you can search the whole world over he ain't here no matter how hated Elijah was he was God's spirit inside of a man no matter how hated he was one day he started walking and a guy was walking behind him every step of the way and that guy wanted the double portion of what he had so if he had four Miracles he would have ate if he had eight Miracles he'd have 16. and so Elijah told him and gave him basic instructions if you see me when I go if you see me when I go still important those instructions are still important keep your eyes on Jesus do not get your eyes on man man will disappoint you man will disappoint you Jesus will never disappoint you the day that he came down to to the water Jordan he needed to get across took his coat off his clock off and he hit the water they walked right across we got the other side Elijah that's what brother bam said found a chariot said there were chariots in every bush and he said he left some for you and it jumped in that chariot and he began to ride and he took his coat off Connie told me said don't don't take your coat off it's your best it should be well where I'm going I'm not going to need a vest he took his cloak off and he throwed it back down to Elisha and Elisha caught him now let me just say this you brother Branham says in second hand robe he said God did not cut the robe to fit Elijah he don't trim the word to fit you I'm looking for a church that fits me you got that opposite [Applause] you got that opposite God trims you [Applause] let me just say this let me just say it real clear brother Ron but that's a hurtful statement this ain't for everybody this ain't for everybody this is for the bride of Christ and God knows who will and who want don't be disappointed when people walk away and steer their nose and go all different kind of things it wasn't for him don't judge them respect them but it wasn't for them but you want to be dancing because it was for you and this was exactly what you was looking for you were thirsting for life and you found it [Applause] Elisha caught this rope it fit him perfectly he didn't notice that he had been so trimmed up in Walking with the Lord for 10 years now this robe fed him there was probably a time it wouldn't fit him but in walking with Elijah for 10 years and watching miracles and he put it on now let me just say this to you that was probably a time that that the wedding garment didn't fit you because you had the Hulk smell on you life now let me just explain something to you about washing Hawks how many's Ever Raised Hawks well we got a few hands here listen they stink if you ain't got it they stink and they wallow in mud they eat things that you would never eat and that's what we were we were some tunes of hogden probably a new word right there hold them you can take obesity out you can fit a rope and a string around her and you can start scrubbing her and you could scrub and you can scrub and you can go to every little spot oh best you look good for a while you can even put a little vaseline on her Make Her Shine because you're going to put her into Rockingham County Fair and you know if you're fortunate you could be the one that gets a blue ribbon but take Bessie home just take obesity home take a ribbon off of her and take the string off her because she didn't get a nature change hello [Applause] in about 30 seconds old Bessie ain't gonna smell the way the perfume will be gone the foundation detergent will be gone the Vaseline that you put on her is gonna be gone she's gonna be muddy if you don't get Jesus [Music] if you don't get Jesus you can pretend you can put your name on the book you can shake the preacher's hand on Monday you're going to be right back and hug them but if you ever get a nature change in your life that whole pen will never be right for you [Applause] I got a picture the other day it was me in white bibbed overalls it was a time that I wore them I actually showed up at my wedding rehearsal in white bib overhauls Homer looked at me but tomorrow I would have a white tuxedo on I would look more appropriate although back in the day before Nike socks we had them big long football socks and I had Green Bay Packer socks on and then babies was pulled up to about right here through a white tuxedo you could see Green Bay stripes nobody was wanting me to be their Pastor then sometimes you look the part and you're not ready for it sometimes you look like you're getting ready you really ready but what if I turned around and sister Connie had just left the barnyard her hair was all in strings blue jean skirt stuff all over I said I didn't I didn't think it was going to be like this I thought at weddings they wore a wedding gown and it'd be clean and it'd be pure and it'd be white you see when I turned around she took my breath she still takes my breath Jesus is coming for a broad he's going to be a real lady and for the critic and the unbeliever they don't like the dress they don't like a dress but this is the dress it's supposed to be on this message is the dress [Applause] you know you may not liked an ark but it was the one that would preserve Noah and his family you could be an unbeliever you could be a doubter build your own Ark but that was the one I'm coming to something there's a lot of people preparing to go into a tribulation period listen to righteous in their own way they're religious in their own way but their tomb is taking them to the tribulation period but there's a message that lack Lazarus called forth and only Lazarus come out of there Brethren said Jesus had to be specific because he was the voice of the Resurrection that's what we've heard in this message is the voice of the Resurrection how did I hear it how did I get here he called you [Music] not a man called you if a man calls you he'll have to take care of you but when God calls you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end Jesus's tomb is empty so is yours so is yours you ever had a job when you quit you never want to go back you're not even interested I never was interested in ever going back to the picnic at the Arsenal I never was interested in hanging around old friends I'm gone I'm gone hey I'm gone I'm gone I'm gone I don't want to say this you there's nothing in sin watch me won't go back to I don't miss hangovers I don't miss being blinded out of my mind from being under the hallucinogen Jesus I don't miss none of that but in that tomb [Applause] I had people take me to the Pentecostal church because they knew I needed it I had people take me to the Baptist Church because they knew I needed it but there wasn't nothing there because I'd already had a case I knew what was real you can run you can hide you can go as far as you want to God knows how to bring your children home the message has called us forth the Rapture as he's descending the shout Goes Forth The Voice and the Trump a gathering he has gathered us together now just as Jesus was here they also had a gathering he gathered his disciples he gathered his believers he gathered 380 that would not go to the upper room but he had 120 that would amen he gathered pilate he gathered Herod he gathered every skeptic like caiaphasis he gathered every one of them because he had to go to Calvary our time he has gathered Skeptics he has gathered scoffers they played the part he has gathered Putin he has gathered the Pope he has gathered China he has gathered North Korea he has gathered all these nations with Atomic Warfare because they are needed they're going to play their part right now they're just revving up the drunks because there's a Revival that's happening among them our nation has become more polluted our schools are polluted our government is polluted if you don't think their government's not polluted you're not reading the news all of that has to happen Sodom and Gomorrah is excelled it's on steroids Among Us and brother Brown Could Only See what will you and I are seeing on a daily basis but God knew he could trust you in Satan's Eden he knew he could trust you that none of this Darkness none of this Sodom condition none of this corrupt governments none of all of this nonsense could shake you [Music] Hallelujah I was thinking as I Was preparing now it's been several years and it became real to me in our country we have Graves that's about four or five hundred years old it's a great span of time that's really not that long some of our loved ones graves are just a few years old and some may be 30 40 50 years old people that stood in this church in 1973 1974 has gone beyond the realm of time listen it they didn't have a lack of doubt they didn't have a lack of faith it was just their time to go home a man's born of woman few days and full of trouble and then they go home to their reward but God made them a promise they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Romans chapter six they were baptized with a covenant that they'll raise and you can put six eight foot of dirt on top of them you have the best casket or a cardboard casket doesn't matter this body might go back to the ashes and even into the gases but God makes a promise but when I was standing in Ireland with brother George there was a deacon in Columbus church there was a deacon that was buried there some fourteen hundred years ago and no doubt he was a good Deacon no doubt he he did his best for pastor Columbo and when it came it's time to die they buried him in the ground a very close uh cemetery and they put a rock up and now even the writing weather has even has even rubbed the the stone to where that you can hardly read that this man lived from such and so to such and so and he was a deacon under Columbus in the church you can't hardly read it because it's almost gone but in God's Great Book in God's Great Book he's not in that tomb [Music] his body might be there but he stepped from that Dimension to another dimension leaving his body behind but one of these mornings one of these mornings no there's not going to come Angels down and dig all those Graves up they're going to stick step from that Dimension to another dimension if you would if you would take him out of the Grave there's probably not a pound of dust left inside of that tomb but he hasn't left lost one item when he stepped from this Dimension to that dimension [Applause] God's not just made promises to our loved ones but all the way back since the days of Jesus to those disciples tombs told them [Applause] I'd like to say this to you in the in the words of a song that we love so much Ain't No Grave ain't no game gonna hold my body down when I hear that trumpet sound I don't care about that ground because it ain't no claim hold my body down in an exercise of the seriousness of the disease that I fight one of the doctors asked me to prepare for a funeral prepare who would speak it and prepare where I would be buried and asked me for that copy of that well I did it I gave all the instructions to Matthew but I don't think I'm going to use them [Applause] be good for you with a woman Matthew ain't no need using them no way them preachers are busy they got things to do just for the insurance policy I didn't buy a casket and I didn't buy a tomb and I I'm not planning to use it it's kind of like Joseph with armathea this is Legend they buried Jesus in the Tomb he goes back in the house his wife looks at him and says but you dug that out for yourself he looks across the table at her and said oh not to worry he's only going to be there three days I know that's not thus saith the Lord but it's a good statement anyway isn't it no matter how much the message has been fought against it wasn't William branham's message it was the message of the Lamb and I want to say this it can't be stopped I want to say it again it cannot be stopped all the unbelief that has came against it didn't stop it you can hire guards to stand that Jesus's tomb and seal it up you can't stop it you can make stories about the disciples must have took the body away it don't matter you can't stop it [Music] we got proof two guys had become delist disillusioned their Messiah had been beaten like no other human being they didn't understand that it was fulfilling Isaiah 53. because people like us needed healing and the prescription would never run out what in 30 days it wasn't 90 days the prescription wouldn't run out now we would not only need healing for our body we would need Resurrection we would need we would need knowing that we're born in sin listen if Rapture didn't happen how many since Jesus has died under expectation for the rapture and so and so Jesus knew I got to take care of them too [Applause] so that when they die they don't just lay there I got to have a place where they'll come and have a reunion following me okay follow me okay from every age they're going to have a reunion and they're going to blend together what age did you come out of laodicea how in the world did you make it oh there's still a lot of me coming there's still a lot of me coming well won't you just come and dance for a little while Jesus had to prepare for our going [Applause] and we would be lost we would be trapped by our natural DNA and Jerry there'll be things that would be handed down from your forefathers that you would have to fight and go and I've been raised in church but why should I be fighting this why should I be fighting this Jesus made a way to take care of that too and it's not your flesh and it's not your spirit although that Soul down on the inside of you when this word is ignited you can you can control that flesh in your spirit your father's coming he's coming now let me just say he had to prepare when you're coming sometimes you may watch your children go for a long time then all of a sudden boom it happens you can't save nobody else because you couldn't save yourself but Jesus knew what day they'd come he knew what hour that they would come so he's making an atonement so you could be saved you see he's not betting he's not iffing he knows every seed that he planted and listen you might be one of those wandering ones now on the internet and once in a while the spirit will come around you and he'll begin to pull on you but something distracts you for a little while and then he'll come around and he'll begin to pull on you and and then something to distract you one day one day that pull will come so strong you'll pass the water tank you'll pass the water tank and you go over here and then you go over another Hill and there stands Papa God and he says welcome home wow come home I'll say there's there's Macomb [Applause] no place like home Hallelujah don't you love the Lord isn't he good to us I can imagine the difficulty in the human flesh of Elisha he's coming down to his time to die and he's one short think about that he walked with Elijah for 10 years and he has just comes all the way up to one short in the miracle list said phenomenal miracles can you imagine how The Devil Wears in his ear bonjour message wasn't right you want you're one short he's taking his last breaths and he's one short that's Devil's whispering in his ear how many of you ever have the devil whisper in your ear I want to remind you something right here you're not the one that made the promise as a matter of fact you got very little to do with it other than just surrender and just yield you can't create a miracle you can't create Rapture you can't create Resurrection but it's your promise bonjour one Joy you're dying you're dying Elisha and you're one it proves Elijah wasn't a prophet it was just an illusion you saw him go up in the air must have been a day where you eat some greens a couple onions one sure Elijah wasn't trusting Elisha he was trusting God and they found a cave and put him in a grave no doubt they prepared his body and put it there you know his body begin to deteriorate right flesh began to fall off he became nothing but just dried skin laying on the bones as a matter of fact you could have never even identified who he was but obviously there had to be a marker and there was a war taking place and the War was happening and one of the guys got killed in the war and they were running and they just couldn't carry him and they found the hole this was going to be his tomb but he didn't really they didn't realize somebody else was already in it and the guy that was one short still had a promise there's going to be a resurrection hang around there's going to be a body change oh brother nobody can live this look around we're not a bunch of prisoners to this world look around we got all kind of joy we got all kind of Liberty look around brother Ron I don't like how y'all dance just look around I Sing Because I'm happy I shout because I'm free [Applause] now I don't know how this guy died and it's immature but he died life left his body and they took him and they didn't have time for a funeral they took him and they throwed him one tomb on top of another tomb I like this one tomb went on top of another tomb and they throwed this Soldier down on a man that had a promise and it must have happened almost simultaneously because this guy caught up with those guys no doubt he didn't know how he died but he knew how he came out back to life now here's what happens you can take this down to the graveyard and you can lay this body down but because I've been throwed into another tomb I've been throwed in the word Jesus is at life life and let me just explain something to you this might be good for you in this life Satan can wear you out but once he comes in with that bee and takes your life that's his last spot that's the last time he can touch you because once you step from this dimension to that dimension brother Doug I'm sorry but you had to come back to life but once you step from this Dimension to that dimension around and go [Applause] News Bulletin he is not dead he is not dead he is risen I want to invite you to your tomb now I'm not laying there I have been risen Give the Lord a good hand this evening Hallelujah Hallelujah it'd be good to us I'll never go back I am alive
