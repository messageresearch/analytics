[43:48] 000 people
[43:50] came to hear the word
[43:55] you can't stop god
[43:58] i like that
[44:00] sometimes when we
[44:01] look at things as their failures you're
[44:04] only getting ready for a breakthrough
[44:07] amen amen god bless you let's read the
[44:10] word this morning i'd like for you to
[44:12] turn to hebrews chapter 12
[44:15] and verse 1.
[44:21] this is the scripture that ignited me to
[44:24] preach the gospel
[44:26] i had heard men
[44:28] i had heard what they had said i'd heard
[44:30] a lot of things i felt unctioned
[44:32] but god's words greater than any other
[44:37] we're foreseeing we are also compassed
[44:39] about was so great a cloud of witnesses
[44:41] we know who they are
[44:44] let us lay aside every weight and every
[44:47] one of us has got to lay aside every
[44:49] weight as an individual you got to do it
[44:52] and the sin which does so easily beset
[44:55] us
[44:56] and let us run with patience the race
[44:59] that is set before us
[45:01] this is where we must look we must focus
[45:05] looking unto jesus the author and the
[45:08] finisher of our faith
[45:10] who for the joy was set before him
[45:14] endured the cross
[45:16] despising the shame and is set down at
[45:19] the right hand of the throne of god
[45:22] if you have a wife take her by the hand
[45:24] if you don't have a wife take yourself
[45:26] by the hand
[45:29] amen you're a child look over at your
[45:32] brother and say we're not going to fight
[45:33] today
[45:34] and hope that stands up for service at
[45:36] least for the service and so
[45:39] amen today is the first sunday of the
[45:41] rest of this year
[45:43] let's ask god that this be the greatest
[45:45] ever
[45:46] and with a deep dedication and a deep
[45:48] sincerity in your hearts amen god bless
[45:51] you let's pray lord jesus we dedicate
[45:54] this day and this service to you
[45:57] lord we fill your special presence in
[45:59] the building this morning so good to
[46:00] have so many wonderful friends with us
[46:03] we ask you that you would anoint us in a
[46:05] very supernatural way
[46:07] god we ask you that you would come and
[46:10] do a direct word in our lives
[46:13] lord we ask you to take the words that
[46:16] god that you have anointed us to speak
[46:18] this morning those words are already
[46:20] anointed but you see our flesh the
[46:22] things that we struggle with i asked you
[46:25] this morning that you would bring a
[46:26] strength touch our hearts today in jesus
[46:30] christ's name we pray
[46:31] a man and a man and a man you may be
[46:34] seated
[46:35] god bless you turn to your neighbor and
[46:36] say let's have church
[46:41] every generation must have its own
[46:43] revival
[46:44] every generation my mother had a revival
[46:47] your grandmother had a revival your
[46:49] great-grandmother had a revival for many
[46:51] of us here in the local area the
[46:54] early pentecostal people were made fun
[46:56] of even shot through the windows bullets
[46:59] would fall off of the dresses as the
[47:01] sisters would dance in the spirit of god
[47:04] it was incredible revival there revivals
[47:06] have came and gone and and the fires
[47:08] have went out in different things and
[47:10] men have denominated it god never did
[47:13] denominate it but men denominated it
[47:16] but we must understand that we are
[47:18] called for this day
[47:20] when god is predestinated he knows what
[47:22] day you'll be born what hour you'll be
[47:24] born but he's also not just seeing that
[47:27] he could do it but he's making sure he
[47:31] has a purpose for your life
[47:35] he has a purpose for your life
[47:39] as great as god is in his pre-planning
[47:42] he has a purpose for your life and for
[47:44] your being here
[47:48] there's junctions that we come to we
[47:50] realize that if this age is going to be
[47:52] the final and we're the final voice to
[47:54] the final age then we are the final
[47:57] runners
[47:59] i was i just made a personal note here i
[48:01] i wasn't going to share it i'll just
[48:02] share it with you
[48:04] in my own personal way
[48:06] i have spoken many
[48:08] through the years probably 30 years of
[48:11] watch night services or our first sunday
[48:14] services of the year
[48:16] and i've stood there encouraging people
[48:18] that this next year would be a year to
[48:21] where that you would deeply con
[48:23] consecrate your life to god and be more
[48:25] sincere
[48:27] rededicating things shoring up things
[48:29] that are loose in your lives
[48:32] getting a re-baptism of the holy ghost
[48:35] because that's the seal of god inside of
[48:38] you
[48:39] we must have that fire or that life of
[48:42] god
[48:43] not enough to have intellectual
[48:45] experiences or be able to explain the
[48:47] bible but it's got to live on the inside
[48:50] of us
[48:52] over the last couple of years
[48:53] circumstances have changed for us as i
[48:56] was just writing some notes this this
[48:58] week and i was thinking as i would be
[49:01] standing here i was thinking about i was
[49:04] thinking in my own self
[49:05] could this be my last dedicational
[49:08] service of the new year
[49:11] if it is i'm not going to stand as a
[49:13] coward
[49:16] i'm going to face the circumstances of
[49:18] life
[49:19] and i'm going to allow the purpose of
[49:21] god to be completed in my life i will
[49:24] not do it with fear i will not do it
[49:26] with cowardness i will not do it with
[49:29] negativity but i will give it with every
[49:32] inch of every strength of i've got in my
[49:35] life
[49:36] are you with me now
[49:39] i'd like to
[49:42] remind you as i would
[49:44] that's not a negative thought there but
[49:46] i'd like to remind you
[49:48] of
[49:49] a buoy
[49:50] as he is dying in the alamo he's been
[49:53] shot up
[49:54] they're getting ready to
[49:56] to
[49:57] to battle probably their final battle
[49:59] actually a line has been drawn in the
[50:01] sand if you're if you want to if you
[50:03] want to leave leave we're going to die
[50:06] here but if you want to leave leave try
[50:08] to escape with your life but if you're
[50:10] going to stay we're going to stay and
[50:12] we're going to fight with everything
[50:14] that is within us
[50:16] david bowie had been shot up and he was
[50:18] very wounded near unto death he said
[50:21] roll me over and he said put a knife in
[50:23] my hand
[50:26] yes
[50:27] he died that day
[50:29] in a ferocious battle
[50:32] but so did five of his
[50:34] his enemy
[50:35] died laying on his body
[50:39] they carried the news to his mother
[50:42] and she said uh
[50:44] how did you find him laying
[50:47] i'll guarantee you there wasn't a knife
[50:49] or a bullet in his back
[50:53] i'd like for that to be said about you
[50:55] and i
[50:56] we're not a bunch of cowards
[50:59] we're not a bunch of wimps
[51:01] in this layout of sea and age somebody's
[51:03] going to make a rapture i want to be one
[51:06] of them
[51:12] c.s lewis would make the statement he
[51:14] said may hell rejoice the day i die
[51:20] you think about that for a little while
[51:22] hallelujah that means you've been
[51:24] tormented to the devil
[51:27] sometimes we got the picture wrong
[51:31] it's not him that's tormenting us but
[51:32] we're tormenting him
[51:39] it may be this morning that there will
[51:41] be men and women that are sitting here
[51:44] that you'll make a final choice
[51:48] you're today what you are because
[51:50] several years ago you chose to be what
[51:52] you are now this quite a statement
[51:55] and you'll choose now what you'll
[51:56] determine to be
[51:58] what you'll be five years from today
[52:02] five years from today you may be a
[52:04] missionary
[52:05] five years from today you may be a
[52:07] renowned christian i'd like to be that
[52:10] five years from today you may be in hell
[52:14] because you made a wrong decision
[52:16] five years from today you may be
[52:18] cleaning spit tunes in a bar room
[52:20] five years from today you may be a
[52:22] prostitute on the street
[52:25] or maybe you'll be a man and woman
[52:27] that's a credit to society
[52:29] because of a choice that you made for
[52:31] christ
[52:33] five years from today you may be in
[52:35] glory gone in the rapture because you
[52:37] made your choice today
[52:40] but you've got to choose
[52:43] you don't look at what you see
[52:46] choose what you see by faith
[52:49] that's the only thing
[52:51] that will count
[52:53] is what you choose by faith
[52:57] lot had to make a choice we see how that
[53:01] worked out
[53:02] you're going to have to make a choice
[53:08] now nobody can make that choice for you
[53:12] we blame teachers we blame presidents
[53:16] we blame we blame a lot of different
[53:18] people we blame pastors
[53:22] because we think that it makes it easier
[53:25] on our guilt
[53:27] to point blame at somebody else
[53:30] because of our failures
[53:34] but let me just say this to you there
[53:36] comes a reckoning day where you and you
[53:38] alone stands before the great creator
[53:40] the great judge himself
[53:42] and then this span of time you've been
[53:44] given a on a time to make a choice
[53:48] based on free moral agency you had a you
[53:50] had a time to make a choice in your life
[53:54] and people are what they are today
[53:56] because of the choice
[54:01] are you with me they are today because
[54:03] of a choice that they made and and maybe
[54:06] you've been a christian for decades but
[54:08] decades ago you made a choice
[54:11] god was pulling on your heart and that
[54:14] pulling you made a choice to move toward
[54:17] him election placed a seed on the inside
[54:20] of you
[54:23] and that predestinated seed caused the
[54:26] pool to go in that direction
[54:28] maybe you were one in a family one in a
[54:30] community that went that way but god
[54:33] rich in mercy
[54:36] many times even overrides your choice
[54:38] and continues to come back after you
[54:42] thank god for that
[54:44] but i think about this
[54:46] what will i be five years from today
[54:50] i don't know about you but i keep a
[54:52] calendar
[54:53] and on that calendar i put my weight
[54:58] last year
[55:00] and then i put my weight this year
[55:02] i put my weight every sunday morning
[55:05] i'm up just a little bit this week if
[55:06] you really want to know
[55:10] thank god for christmas and new year's
[55:11] and
[55:13] everybody makes a decision well i'm
[55:15] going to do this and i'm going to do
[55:16] that that makes resolutions of what
[55:18] they're going to do over the coming
[55:20] weeks
[55:22] 99 of those will quit
[55:25] it is a time to where that gym
[55:27] membership goes through the roof
[55:31] huge gems make a living on january
[55:36] intentions
[55:38] promises that they'll be
[55:40] february march april all the way to
[55:42] december those gyms will be mostly empty
[55:45] until january again
[55:52] it's kind of like i heard a fella say
[55:54] well
[55:55] if it's the large will i find a parking
[55:57] spot
[55:58] at the krispy kreme donuts
[56:02] and he said i'd like to thank the lord
[56:03] on the 13th round around the thing i
[56:06] found a parking
[56:14] spot you say well brother ron i'm nobody
[56:17] let me just say you are somebody
[56:23] god made you special
[56:26] you may not like your looks
[56:28] you may not like your build you may not
[56:31] like your hair color you may not like
[56:33] your eyes but god arranged what you
[56:36] would look like
[56:39] he had this one to marry this one and
[56:40] this one to marry that one and protected
[56:43] your natural seed
[56:45] all the way down through
[56:48] and he watched over you and you said
[56:50] well brother on god never did nothing
[56:52] for you to get you here was a phenomenal
[56:55] miracle
[57:04] maybe it was your great great
[57:06] grandfather that was in a foxhole and
[57:09] just something told him
[57:11] jump over in that next hole and just at
[57:13] the jump a bomb went off i've heard that
[57:16] over and over and over again
[57:20] i've walked in ireland i've walked in in
[57:24] belgium where the wars took place
[57:27] i've seen the great bunkers that are
[57:29] there how many men died
[57:31] on those
[57:32] banks of the sea
[57:35] how many men
[57:44] we're at another spot
[57:46] more people have died to covet than died
[57:48] in those wars
[57:54] it's a sad deal it's more than a
[57:55] political deal
[57:58] it's a devil
[58:00] it's a real devil
[58:01] great men have died
[58:04] poorest of men have died women have died
[58:06] children have done
[58:09] but there's still a blood that can take
[58:11] care of us
[58:14] are you with me now
[58:16] the scripture says in revelation chapter
[58:19] 3 and verse 21
[58:22] to him that overcometh
[58:24] this is an action scripture
[58:28] this is a prophecy scripture
[58:30] to him that overcometh this is the
[58:32] laodicean age that we're reading from to
[58:34] him that overcometh will i grant to sit
[58:36] with me in my throne
[58:38] even as i
[58:40] also overcame
[58:44] and am sat down with my father in his
[58:47] throne
[58:48] i'll get to some of those thoughts in
[58:50] just a moment
[58:51] numbers chapter 14 and verse 24 but my
[58:55] servant caleb
[58:58] because he had another spirit
[59:01] with him
[59:02] and hath
[59:04] followed me fully
[59:06] will i bring into the land wherein to
[59:10] he
[59:11] went
[59:12] and his seed
[59:14] shall possess it
[59:18] quite a powerful quite a powerful thing
[59:21] some way or another he made a choice
[59:25] i've been here now 40 years in this
[59:27] message
[59:28] i want my mountain
[59:31] may be older i may be weaker but god
[59:34] promised he'd give me my mountain i want
[59:37] it
[59:40] in romans 12 and verse 1 i beseech you
[59:43] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[59:45] that you present your bodies a living
[59:48] sacrifice
[59:49] holy and acceptable unto god which is a
[59:52] reasonable service and be not conformed
[59:55] to this world but be you transformed by
[59:57] the renewing of your mind that you may
[1:00:00] prove what is a good and acceptable and
[1:00:03] perfect will of god
[1:00:07] my brother ron but i've got so many
[1:00:09] troubles in my life what about sarah
[1:00:14] what about sarah enduring 90 years
[1:00:18] of not having a child
[1:00:21] what about job
[1:00:22] don't even have to say any more there
[1:00:25] nobody's ever had a week or two like job
[1:00:27] had with
[1:00:30] a year of trial that he had to go
[1:00:32] through nobody's ever had a week like
[1:00:34] that
[1:00:35] isaac endured the blindness
[1:00:38] but it was the plan of god
[1:00:42] god had to have him blind because he
[1:00:44] would have never picked jacob
[1:00:48] even the devil must be amused that god
[1:00:51] picked you
[1:00:58] hallelujah
[1:01:00] shadrach meshach and abednego god was
[1:01:02] with them in a field
[1:01:04] he was with them on their jobs he was
[1:01:06] with them in their homes but he was
[1:01:08] definitely with him in the fire
[1:01:15] sometimes we think we're not protected
[1:01:16] until we're in the fire
[1:01:20] sometimes we think we're not going
[1:01:21] through anything until after the miracle
[1:01:23] is over and we say god was with us but
[1:01:25] you don't realize he's with you for
[1:01:26] decades before that
[1:01:30] but it's after you've come through it
[1:01:32] and the car sailed a certain way and you
[1:01:34] didn't die you get out and give glory to
[1:01:36] god but it was like the miles before
[1:01:41] without watching over the child when
[1:01:43] somebody would have grabbed it and took
[1:01:44] it away and you just there just in the
[1:01:46] nick of time god was with him all the
[1:01:48] time
[1:01:52] come on church
[1:01:55] bartimaeus as we heard last night was
[1:01:58] blind
[1:01:59] but there was god there to take care of
[1:02:01] him
[1:02:02] maybe many days he wrestled with the
[1:02:04] experience of being blind
[1:02:07] there was legion wandering around in the
[1:02:10] tombs he didn't get there yesterday but
[1:02:12] jesus knew where he was at i want you to
[1:02:15] understand this morning no matter how
[1:02:17] bad your situation is jesus is walking
[1:02:21] through the tombs of your life and he
[1:02:23] knows exactly where you're at and he's
[1:02:25] not ashamed of your condition he's not
[1:02:28] ashamed of your situation and he's more
[1:02:31] than able to deliver you from that
[1:02:43] the devil whispers in her ear that god
[1:02:45] has forgotten us
[1:02:48] how many has ever felt like you've been
[1:02:49] forgotten
[1:02:52] felt like nobody loved you how many has
[1:02:54] ever been told nobody loves you
[1:02:59] nobody cares about
[1:03:00] wow there's nobody ever been as sick as
[1:03:02] you are
[1:03:06] what a stupid devil if you start
[1:03:07] believing him ain't nobody been as sick
[1:03:09] as you are
[1:03:11] you're still alive
[1:03:14] that counts for somethin
[1:03:22] you're still breathing don't let the
[1:03:24] devil whisper lies in your ear when you
[1:03:26] get down don't you know that god's still
[1:03:28] the same god when you're healthy as when
[1:03:31] you're sick
[1:03:35] and just in case it is your last breath
[1:03:38] look where you going and look where he's
[1:03:41] going
[1:03:42] [Applause]
[1:03:48] god's always on time lazarus could
[1:03:50] testify to that this morning he's always
[1:03:53] on time
[1:03:55] when daniel was in a lion's den
[1:04:01] yes they were real lines
[1:04:04] cause in a few days they'll eat the
[1:04:06] accusers
[1:04:09] those same lines in a few days will eat
[1:04:11] the accuses
[1:04:14] they were hungry that day but there was
[1:04:16] somebody standing with daniel that was
[1:04:19] greater than the king line
[1:04:23] are you with me i want you to know in
[1:04:25] your trial you may not see him you may
[1:04:29] not feel him but he's there with you
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:40] hallelujah any good to us
[1:04:43] he's got a stone for your slink
[1:04:47] he's got fireproof suits
[1:04:50] for you to walk around in a fiery
[1:04:52] furnace
[1:04:54] as a matter of fact he can help you walk
[1:04:56] on water
[1:04:57] if the need
[1:04:59] needs to apply
[1:05:01] sometimes we need to count it all joy as
[1:05:03] we heard last night when we're counted
[1:05:05] worthy to go through situations of life
[1:05:08] when he says if you trust me i'll use
[1:05:10] you like never before
[1:05:13] it is not you that's building the bridge
[1:05:15] across to the other side you're just
[1:05:18] walking
[1:05:21] where's the end of the tunnel don't
[1:05:23] worry about the end of the tunnel
[1:05:24] where's the light that's at the end of
[1:05:26] the tunnel where's the other side of
[1:05:28] this bridge
[1:05:30] it doesn't matter where we're going to
[1:05:32] land but we're going to be with him
[1:05:39] our god defeats every devil there's not
[1:05:41] one he can't defeat
[1:05:44] i wish i had a loud speaker to hell to
[1:05:46] tell every one of them today
[1:05:48] all of you are defeated in the name of
[1:05:50] jesus christ
[1:05:53] now i'd like to have the loudspeaker to
[1:05:55] every christian and remind you god has
[1:05:57] defeated every devil in hell what do you
[1:05:59] have to be afraid about
[1:06:11] winston churchill told us to never give
[1:06:13] up
[1:06:14] never
[1:06:15] never
[1:06:16] never give up
[1:06:19] miriam was dancing today
[1:06:22] she grabbed a tambourine and she began
[1:06:23] to dance
[1:06:25] because of all of her taskmasters we're
[1:06:27] dead
[1:06:28] and if we could only realize tonight
[1:06:31] that your taskmaster is dead
[1:06:34] and he's only a haunted image that's
[1:06:36] trying to remind you of what your
[1:06:38] yesteryear was that was like
[1:06:42] you'd grab your tambourine today
[1:06:46] i sent this to
[1:06:48] to
[1:06:51] my family this week
[1:06:54] and i i told him this is a quote that i
[1:06:56] found
[1:07:00] i didn't tell him it was my quote
[1:07:07] do not complain about what you permit
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:16] do not complain about what
[1:07:20] you
[1:07:21] permit
[1:07:25] people stay with the husband that beats
[1:07:26] on them
[1:07:28] the reason that that's going on is you
[1:07:30] permit it
[1:07:32] the first time you he laid his dirty
[1:07:35] rotten hands on you and he's too big a
[1:07:36] coward to hit another man
[1:07:43] you should have walked away
[1:07:45] and realized that you made a mistake
[1:07:51] i don't know if you paid attention to
[1:07:52] when billy graham's
[1:07:55] funeral took place
[1:07:57] but his daughter gave a testimony
[1:08:00] she married a man that she thought was
[1:08:02] mr wonderful that presented himself as
[1:08:05] mr wonderful
[1:08:08] to the community was mr wonderful
[1:08:11] but the first night behind closed doors
[1:08:13] she recognized
[1:08:15] what a demon he was
[1:08:18] she got in the car
[1:08:20] in the middle of the night and drove
[1:08:21] herself back
[1:08:23] to billy graham's house
[1:08:25] and she said she was expecting judgment
[1:08:29] and said she found her daddy
[1:08:31] standing on the porch with his arms wide
[1:08:34] open
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:37] full of grace and full of mercy and full
[1:08:40] of protection
[1:08:46] papa god's greater than billy graham
[1:08:52] a story that you may not know
[1:08:55] brother branham said in a in a hotel one
[1:08:57] night because there were some men making
[1:08:59] some boats about
[1:09:00] their little girls
[1:09:03] and brother branham set with a rifle on
[1:09:04] his lap looking out the window
[1:09:08] because he was protecting his children
[1:09:11] now let me just say this to you
[1:09:14] pastors we preach sermons that are
[1:09:16] difficult
[1:09:18] because we're trying to protect the
[1:09:20] enemy away from you
[1:09:23] we'll call out to you and make it
[1:09:25] individual
[1:09:26] maybe not in front of an audience but we
[1:09:28] may speak to you privately
[1:09:31] that's that of love not out of hate or
[1:09:33] mischief or just because we can do it
[1:09:36] i thank god there's a god that can
[1:09:38] discern the thoughts of the heart and
[1:09:40] know the enemy that is trying to attack
[1:09:42] a person to bring it down
[1:09:44] any good shepherd
[1:09:47] any good shepherd across america or
[1:09:49] around the world
[1:09:50] they're trying to protect sheep not beat
[1:09:52] them
[1:09:54] i think that this place is a place to
[1:09:57] come to be encouraged
[1:09:59] to be inspired
[1:10:01] to be anointed
[1:10:03] to have fresh vision for tomorrow we
[1:10:06] don't come here to be beaten bashed and
[1:10:08] knocked around and make you do something
[1:10:11] you need to fall in love with jesus
[1:10:13] that's all we need to do
[1:10:16] that's my courage if you fall in love
[1:10:18] with jesus
[1:10:20] you don't have to fall in love with me
[1:10:22] but if you fall in love with jesus
[1:10:26] he'll cure every situation in your life
[1:10:33] we have friends driving from four hours
[1:10:35] from north carolina
[1:10:38] you come not to be beat around knocked
[1:10:40] around frail around
[1:10:43] you come to be encouraged you come to be
[1:10:45] strengthened you come to having a
[1:10:47] revival in your heart
[1:10:49] maybe one sentence in a sermon and
[1:10:51] you'll talk about it for hours going
[1:10:53] back down the road i was praying about
[1:10:56] that very thing and god spoke to me in
[1:10:59] that sermon he spoke to me in that song
[1:11:02] whether you drive 4 hours or 15 minutes
[1:11:04] it doesn't matter
[1:11:06] the thing that you do is break through
[1:11:08] the realm of flesh
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:18] jesus knows what it is to have a
[1:11:20] headache
[1:11:23] he was crowned with thorns
[1:11:26] jesus knows what it is to be hungry
[1:11:30] because he fasted for 40 days
[1:11:34] jesus knows what it is to be slandered
[1:11:37] he knows what it is to be abandoned
[1:11:40] jesus knows what it's like to be a
[1:11:42] refugee
[1:11:46] to flee homeland
[1:11:48] and live under oppressive governments
[1:11:54] jesus knows what it is to mourn and weep
[1:11:58] he knows what pain and grief is
[1:12:01] when he came to the tomb of his friend
[1:12:04] jesus knows what it is to have heard
[1:12:06] hands
[1:12:07] and your feet and burned
[1:12:09] flesh torn
[1:12:11] and a heart broken
[1:12:13] look at what jesus went through with the
[1:12:15] agony of the garden
[1:12:17] carrying the cross being mopped spat
[1:12:20] nails driven through his hands
[1:12:22] being scourged terribly
[1:12:25] suffered
[1:12:27] many things for mine in your sake
[1:12:31] no matter how bad that we have it we
[1:12:33] could never
[1:12:34] feel the agony that jesus felt
[1:12:38] but he didn't do it for himself
[1:12:40] he did it for you
[1:12:46] jesus knew what it was like to weep for
[1:12:48] the knot
[1:12:49] to stir death right in the eye
[1:12:53] and tell it it was defeated
[1:12:57] jesus knew what it was like to be in a
[1:12:59] storm
[1:13:00] what a storm can do it can cause fear
[1:13:02] and anxiety
[1:13:05] jesus knows what your troubles is like
[1:13:09] so as we start this year let me just say
[1:13:11] this you jesus has been with you for
[1:13:13] this length of time
[1:13:15] do we not trust our future to him
[1:13:18] [Music]
[1:13:19] he is the one that rolled the stars that
[1:13:22] we look at off of the ends of his
[1:13:24] fingers
[1:13:25] the north star has never moved
[1:13:28] the stars of the galaxy they hold their
[1:13:30] place
[1:13:33] because god placed them there
[1:13:38] he's still the captain of the host
[1:13:42] are you with me now
[1:13:44] remember this he's infinite
[1:13:47] he's god
[1:13:49] he's omnipotent
[1:13:51] he's omniscient
[1:13:52] he's on the present
[1:13:54] he knows all things he has all wisdom he
[1:13:57] has all time he covers all space and all
[1:14:00] power
[1:14:00] he is infinite
[1:14:05] and if he isn't that he's not god
[1:14:10] if he can't do all things he's not
[1:14:11] almighty god
[1:14:13] but if he's almighty god
[1:14:15] he
[1:14:16] can do
[1:14:18] all things
[1:14:22] a man told me the other day that he was
[1:14:24] mad at god
[1:14:27] really
[1:14:30] god didn't do them things to you
[1:14:35] maybe it was a chain of circumstances
[1:14:37] that happened in your life
[1:14:40] but sometimes those trials that you went
[1:14:42] through were for your good.
[1:14:48] because everything is full you're good
[1:14:52] and let me just say if it's for you good
[1:14:54] it's not just to be done to see if it's
[1:14:57] for your good he's got a purpose
[1:14:59] that you will be able to turn and some
[1:15:01] help somebody else that's going through
[1:15:04] the trial
[1:15:06] there's not a day that i've been
[1:15:08] aggravated at god because of cancer
[1:15:12] but somewhere in this purpose i can turn
[1:15:15] and try to help somebody else and
[1:15:18] encourage somebody else
[1:15:25] are you with me
[1:15:27] when i was a young man believe it or not
[1:15:29] i ran i ran
[1:15:32] different things
[1:15:34] and i would run and train and do do
[1:15:36] things and
[1:15:39] you know in running this race
[1:15:42] that we've got somewhere there's got to
[1:15:43] be a starting point
[1:15:46] generally a gun sounds
[1:15:50] and you take off
[1:15:53] somewhere after the first lap you're
[1:15:55] going to find out did you train right
[1:16:00] in boxing it is said that in the first
[1:16:03] round
[1:16:04] after the hardest punch is thrown
[1:16:08] your
[1:16:09] opposition knows how well you trained
[1:16:15] are you with me
[1:16:17] now listen you're gonna never whip the
[1:16:18] devil without training

[1:16:55] and my words abide in you ask what you
[1:16:57] will
[1:16:58] you speaking across your lips because
[1:17:02] who you are
[1:17:06] are is a masterpiece to god
[1:17:08] you were anointed in place for the
[1:17:10] position of this day
[1:17:15] now do something with it
[1:17:20] trying to behave
[1:17:23] trying to behave
[1:17:28] you know
[1:17:30] everybody likes to see the guy that wins
[1:17:33] the gold
[1:17:34] at the olympics
[1:17:36] stands on the podium
[1:17:39] no matter what nation
[1:17:41] they'll play the song the anthem
[1:17:45] across their heart or salute or whatever
[1:17:47] they stand there with the goal
[1:17:50] you don't see the untold hours of
[1:17:53] preparation
[1:17:58] of getting up at four o'clock in the
[1:17:59] morning when nobody else is in town
[1:18:01] getting up
[1:18:03] and running and exercising and doing
[1:18:05] certain specific exercises certain
[1:18:08] resistance training preparation to
[1:18:11] perform
[1:18:12] and then on that special day
[1:18:14] everything's got to be right
[1:18:17] you watch what you eat you watch what
[1:18:19] you do you watch what if they can do
[1:18:21] that for the olympics
[1:18:24] which if they get poorer will sell that
[1:18:26] piece of gold
[1:18:28] but if they can do that for a temporal
[1:18:30] gift what about you for an eternal gift
[1:18:35] [Applause]
[1:18:37] i heard matthew speak on time
[1:18:40] everybody's got the same amount
[1:18:46] everybody's got the same amount nobody's
[1:18:49] given
[1:18:50] special extra five minutes in a day
[1:18:56] some people need it but
[1:19:11] but everybody's given the same
[1:19:13] and people go i wonder i wonder what
[1:19:17] i wonder how he got where he got
[1:19:22] you know we we look at men
[1:19:24] and i have these notes written down
[1:19:27] under each messenger there are men
[1:19:30] anointed
[1:19:32] to raise up under that message to carry
[1:19:34] the message on
[1:19:36] so under our messenger god raised up men
[1:19:39] now if i got go to start naming names
[1:19:42] and
[1:19:43] i'll hurt somebody's feelings
[1:19:45] well
[1:19:46] you know i got a long list here laying
[1:19:49] in front of me
[1:19:51] and so i might as well hurt a few
[1:19:52] feelings
[1:20:00] but when i think about a ned biscuit
[1:20:02] what he did with his life
[1:20:05] one of the greatest ambassadors of the
[1:20:07] world he wasn't rich but one of the
[1:20:08] greatest ambassadors of the message of
[1:20:11] this age
[1:20:13] stood he could have been the premier of
[1:20:15] canada
[1:20:16] he could have been one of the wealthiest
[1:20:18] men
[1:20:20] that there ever was but he stood as an
[1:20:22] ambassador of the message
[1:20:24] all of these years
[1:20:28] what a reward
[1:20:31] when i think of donny reagan
[1:20:34] a man out of kentucky of almost
[1:20:36] nowhereville
[1:20:38] that's one of the greatest preachers
[1:20:40] that ever lived
[1:20:43] i mean phenomenal and you just staggered
[1:20:46] thing where'd he get that
[1:20:50] where did he get that you've you've read
[1:20:52] the same scripture over and over again
[1:20:54] but his gift allows him insight
[1:20:57] but he could have sold it to the world
[1:21:03] these men are unappreciated in this
[1:21:05] realm
[1:21:06] tim pruitt that said in brother
[1:21:08] branham's meetings in shreveport there
[1:21:10] said a crippled boy no he didn't get
[1:21:12] called out they took him maybe to get
[1:21:15] called out to be prayed for that that
[1:21:17] his crippledness would leave
[1:21:19] he didn't get to play like the rest of
[1:21:21] the boys but god took that boy in a
[1:21:24] large family
[1:21:25] he took that boy and made him the
[1:21:27] spurgeon of this message
[1:21:30] one of the greatest preachers that ever
[1:21:33] lived in history
[1:21:36] go ahead devil get mad
[1:21:47] i'm talking about not decades i'm
[1:21:48] talking about history
[1:21:58] murphy wong
[1:22:00] from china
[1:22:03] murphy wong single-handedly
[1:22:06] has translated over 600 sermons i
[1:22:09] understand
[1:22:11] maybe more than that now
[1:22:13] 600 sermons
[1:22:17] he translated the bible
[1:22:20] the king james bible
[1:22:29] and a revival happened in china
[1:22:32] and brother caleb
[1:22:34] was just released from from prison
[1:22:39] and you can go back and watch it but
[1:22:40] brother caleb says that what held him in
[1:22:42] prison was a sermon
[1:22:46] and it was a sermon that i preached
[1:22:49] in prison that sermon kept reverberating
[1:22:52] in his ears
[1:22:53] encourage yourself
[1:22:57] and while in prison he led others to the
[1:22:59] lord
[1:23:01] he would have never did that on the
[1:23:02] street
[1:23:05] listen god's purpose can never be
[1:23:07] defeated
[1:23:10] are you with me now
[1:23:12] brother brandon points to a woman that
[1:23:14] was
[1:23:15] that was very powerful in her day
[1:23:18] and she
[1:23:19] felt like that they needed a revival in
[1:23:21] their town
[1:23:22] she hired an old preacher and she didn't
[1:23:24] have enough money but she rented a
[1:23:26] barn she cleaned out all the manure
[1:23:29] and that meeting looked like it was
[1:23:31] terribly
[1:23:32] unsuccessful but at the last service a
[1:23:36] straggly 12 year old boy with long hair
[1:23:40] and raggedy clothes walked in and gave
[1:23:42] his heart to the lord and that man was
[1:23:45] moody
[1:23:47] and moody led a half a million souls to
[1:23:49] jesus christ
[1:23:52] and it all will be counted for the
[1:23:54] record of that woman of what's she done
[1:23:59] are you with me now
[1:24:00] peter cartwright that preached in this
[1:24:03] area
[1:24:04] that was one of the most powerful men
[1:24:06] that ever lived
[1:24:08] what way they did they didn't lay on the
[1:24:11] the
[1:24:12] the laurels of yesterday
[1:24:14] they march forward and charge like never
[1:24:18] before
[1:24:20] we talk about obstacles
[1:24:24] i would i would guarantee you that if 30
[1:24:26] men walked in here wanted to stop this
[1:24:28] meeting today it would upset a whole lot
[1:24:30] of you
[1:24:31] i may have way too much of peter
[1:24:32] cartwright on the inside of me
[1:24:35] peter cartwright walked right down and
[1:24:37] he fought the first one and he fought
[1:24:39] the next one and he fought the next one
[1:24:41] and he whipped 30 men
[1:24:44] in church
[1:24:50] and then on sunday morning nobody felt
[1:24:53] like they had the victory
[1:24:55] after that converse that took place
[1:24:58] there on wednesday night and all the
[1:25:00] other preachers said in this meeting
[1:25:02] they said ah we we don't feel no
[1:25:04] anointing he said let me preach
[1:25:07] and he walked to the pulpit and he
[1:25:08] preached a sermon called the gates of
[1:25:11] hell shall not prevail
[1:25:14] and the service broke out and he
[1:25:16] preached all evening sunday evening
[1:25:19] brother tim you hear that he preached
[1:25:21] all evening sunday evening
[1:25:23] and they went and the revival broke out
[1:25:26] and they preached and then on monday
[1:25:28] they were still there and tuesday they
[1:25:30] were still there on wednesday afternoon
[1:25:32] they baptized over 300 people
[1:25:46] their flame burned
[1:25:51] their flame burned hot as i listened to
[1:25:55] the sermons last night
[1:25:59] williams never spoke better than he did
[1:26:01] last night
[1:26:04] losing his father
[1:26:06] coveted situations
[1:26:08] out almost a month and now here he is
[1:26:11] and preached the best sermon stupid
[1:26:13] devil
[1:26:15] i just i just sat there and grinned you
[1:26:16] know the devil thought he'd done knocked
[1:26:18] him around a bit
[1:26:19] and he just preached his best sermon
[1:26:21] right there last night
[1:26:24] [Applause]
[1:26:33] in a
[1:26:34] minute a minute you'll find me i won't
[1:26:37] say anything that i don't mean
[1:26:39] because somewhere another you got to
[1:26:40] back it up
[1:26:45] pecan pie
[1:26:56] joe green was supposed to be here next
[1:26:58] week but
[1:26:59] due to covet conditions can't be here
[1:27:03] but i think about the legacy of his
[1:27:05] father
[1:27:08] built about 600 churches
[1:27:11] a poor man he was a poor man by
[1:27:15] by money rights
[1:27:16] but he's a rich man in heaven
[1:27:20] because he saw that there was churches
[1:27:22] that
[1:27:23] couldn't there was people that didn't
[1:27:24] have a church they'd been cast out of
[1:27:26] their assemblies and now needed a place
[1:27:28] to worship
[1:27:29] and he got started in jamaica started in
[1:27:32] cuba started in different places
[1:27:34] and he built
[1:27:35] buildings all over the world
[1:27:37] maybe people listening to this actually
[1:27:39] worship in those buildings
[1:27:41] we have built some buildings
[1:27:44] all of us have done great work but let
[1:27:46] me say this to you
[1:27:48] i think about dan daisley
[1:27:52] dan was
[1:27:54] for those that never met him dan was a
[1:27:56] guy that was a little bit he was he was
[1:27:58] short like me
[1:28:00] a little bit rounder than me
[1:28:04] and he had coke bottled glasses
[1:28:08] and that little guy could walk out to a
[1:28:09] pulpit
[1:28:11] and shake the kingdom of hell
[1:28:15] he didn't look like a preacher
[1:28:18] but when he got wound up
[1:28:22] i'll never forget his last service here
[1:28:24] he was unannounced
[1:28:26] he walked in the back door
[1:28:29] and he said i just wanted to come see
[1:28:31] you guys i said good
[1:28:32] you're preaching
[1:28:36] all right i got something to say
[1:28:40] you know he just kind of walked out to
[1:28:42] this pulpit and you as an audience sat
[1:28:44] there and if you remember what he said
[1:28:48] he said
[1:28:49] i think my wife is having an affair
[1:28:57] and we all just kind of oh it ain't
[1:28:59] something to tell in public here
[1:29:07] and he went back in the old testament
[1:29:09] and found a man that had accused his
[1:29:10] wife
[1:29:11] that went before the priest
[1:29:15] and if he was wrong
[1:29:16] all of his thigh would brought out
[1:29:20] she was wrong
[1:29:22] it would go the other way
[1:29:26] and he began to preach on
[1:29:28] what what
[1:29:30] matthew would talk about a cross-eyed
[1:29:33] person
[1:29:34] that had lost focus
[1:29:38] one eye on the world and one eye on
[1:29:40] christ
[1:29:43] and he would preach on
[1:29:44] too many christians have another lover
[1:29:49] i find it interesting that that was his
[1:29:50] last sermon here
[1:29:53] that he would preach a sermon that would
[1:29:55] tell us and remind us
[1:29:57] we don't want to fall in love with this
[1:29:59] world
[1:30:01] we only to fall in love with jesus
[1:30:03] christ
[1:30:05] no matter what car you drive or no
[1:30:07] matter what house you live in or
[1:30:11] relationship that you're involved in
[1:30:14] make sure that jesus is number one in
[1:30:18] your life
[1:30:26] he laughed in the back office he said i
[1:30:28] took your breath didn't i
[1:30:36] a fella named wayne lawson walks in our
[1:30:38] pulpit and he is actually
[1:30:40] a lawyer
[1:30:43] with the word of god
[1:30:45] and he starts out so mild and meek
[1:30:49] before he's done he's done shook the
[1:30:51] kingdom of hell
[1:30:54] whether it's an hour whether it's two
[1:30:56] hours
[1:30:57] and he has so laced the word
[1:30:59] it's just hard to even argue with it
[1:31:04] and it's not by some intellectual
[1:31:07] thoughts
[1:31:08] as a matter of fact you don't get too
[1:31:10] much intellectual preachers here that
[1:31:12] think they know anything
[1:31:14] but you wanna i i try my best to have
[1:31:16] men that's got fire in their bosom
[1:31:21] because if you don't have fire down here
[1:31:23] you'll never have fire out there
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:27] and too many times we've adopted
[1:31:29] computers and and we've adopted ipads
[1:31:32] and put quotes together and we've got
[1:31:34] just good motivational speakers
[1:31:38] but we need some men that can shake the
[1:31:41] kingdom of hell
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:46] i can think of the david myers the the
[1:31:48] david iversons
[1:31:50] are you with me the ed hammermeisters
[1:31:52] the kelly hildebrands of the world the
[1:31:54] jason jacksons the timothy pruitt's the
[1:31:57] danny stevens
[1:31:59] the bill hershbergers the timothy of
[1:32:01] seance brother sergie from russia are
[1:32:04] you with me i'm sorry i didn't get all
[1:32:06] your names called
[1:32:08] but i want to encourage you as men of
[1:32:10] god
[1:32:13] we are in the final laps of the race
[1:32:18] we don't have time to have a picnic
[1:32:22] we're in a battle
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:28] we hear statements like are you with me
[1:32:32] somebody say amen
[1:32:34] somebody praise the lord somebody
[1:32:36] rejoice
[1:32:41] so we've all got a part
[1:32:45] we come to church we all have a part
[1:32:50] i won't be just a few more minutes but
[1:32:54] one time i went to a symphony in
[1:32:56] in washington dc i was
[1:32:59] one of those gifted children
[1:33:02] and so i was i was able to
[1:33:05] be one of
[1:33:06] two in our county
[1:33:08] that was allowed to go
[1:33:11] i was part of a governor's school type
[1:33:13] thing
[1:33:15] and so
[1:33:17] i went to a symphony i didn't realize it
[1:33:19] would have much bearing on me but it
[1:33:21] still does today
[1:33:25] we walked in and we sat down and we were
[1:33:26] ones of thousands of people sitting
[1:33:28] there
[1:33:30] and people came out in their tuxedos and
[1:33:33] ladies in their black dresses
[1:33:36] and every one of them had the same type
[1:33:38] of dress on every man had the same type
[1:33:40] of tuxedo on there were some guys with
[1:33:42] us there was a guy with a stick
[1:33:48] and he was standing there and that that
[1:33:49] stick didn't mean nothing to me but it
[1:33:51] meant something to every person
[1:33:56] now all of those people
[1:33:58] came from different places
[1:34:01] and they all were there to play the same
[1:34:04] sheets of sheet music
[1:34:07] follow this just for a moment
[1:34:12] what finds this interesting is my cousin
[1:34:15] was playing there that day
[1:34:18] she was a little girl
[1:34:19] she was four foot ten
[1:34:21] she was red-headed
[1:34:23] she was phenomenally gifted
[1:34:26] she's been dead now about 10 years
[1:34:29] from cancer
[1:34:33] she was phenomenally gifted
[1:34:36] she was my age
[1:34:39] her name was ella
[1:34:43] thinking about another ella
[1:34:50] now i want to preach to you
[1:34:54] and they walked out there and they
[1:34:56] played that music
[1:34:57] and you know nobody had to give their
[1:34:59] life story
[1:35:02] nobody had to tell what they were going
[1:35:04] through
[1:35:09] but all of a sudden
[1:35:11] you know it was a horrible racket when
[1:35:14] they all were warming up
[1:35:16] flutes warming up
[1:35:18] trombones were warming up
[1:35:20] drums warming up
[1:35:22] everybody was warming up
[1:35:25] you know
[1:35:26] the trumpets were warming up
[1:35:29] it was horrible
[1:35:31] as a matter of fact you needed earplugs
[1:35:35] we got there about an hour early and
[1:35:36] everybody was doing their warm-up
[1:35:38] but when it came time
[1:35:40] and the music started preparing people
[1:35:42] the atmosphere was set
[1:35:44] now the conductor comes out
[1:35:46] and he lays his sheet music out that
[1:35:48] they're all going to play
[1:35:51] nobody's arguing with the sheet music
[1:36:02] nobody's arguing with it
[1:36:08] it is what it is
[1:36:11] he wrote it we didn't write it
[1:36:15] it's not fair brother ron he's the
[1:36:17] writer
[1:36:19] he's the writer
[1:36:21] he's the creator
[1:36:23] well i want to argue with it
[1:36:25] take it up with him
[1:36:30] we're the kind of church here that just
[1:36:32] believes it all
[1:36:34] so we're not having to tear it out well
[1:36:35] we don't believe that today then you
[1:36:37] know we didn't believe that 1400 years
[1:36:39] ago so we've heard that part out and we
[1:36:41] did
[1:36:42] yeah
[1:36:46] i said they come in and they they start
[1:36:49] and maybe it's bach
[1:36:51] or beethoven
[1:36:55] and everybody plays their part
[1:36:57] nobody gets out of place everybody plays
[1:36:59] their part
[1:37:01] and you may not even understand music
[1:37:04] but i'm going to tell you what before
[1:37:05] that thing is over they have moved you
[1:37:08] emotionally
[1:37:11] they've got you feeling like clapping
[1:37:13] screaming shouting they you might not
[1:37:16] even understand peter and the wolf but
[1:37:19] they've got your hair feeling like it's
[1:37:20] standing on the head and that drum
[1:37:23] and it feels like your heart's beating
[1:37:25] inside of your chest
[1:37:26] and you're one of ten thousand people
[1:37:28] sitting in the audience
[1:37:30] cause it affects everybody
[1:37:40] now here's what happens here at church
[1:37:44] are you with me
[1:37:45] are you with me
[1:37:46] this is how it's gonna happen the rest
[1:37:48] of this year
[1:37:51] you're gonna drive four hours
[1:37:53] and you're gonna anticipate what kind of
[1:37:55] music we're gonna play today
[1:37:58] and you're gonna maybe drop 15 minutes
[1:38:00] or 30 minutes or 40 minutes and you may
[1:38:02] have went through
[1:38:04] every valley that you possibly could
[1:38:06] have went through
[1:38:08] every turmoil that you could have went
[1:38:10] through the devil may have whispered
[1:38:12] every part in your ear
[1:38:17] and you may not put on a tuxedo
[1:38:22] but you walk in and you take your place
[1:38:27] and whether you know this or not
[1:38:28] thousands of angels
[1:38:30] are in attendance
[1:38:34] and they're standing more of them than
[1:38:36] it is of us
[1:38:40] and you know once you get seated
[1:38:42] it don't matter what you went through
[1:38:44] are you getting it now
[1:38:47] i've taken about an hour to get you to
[1:38:49] this spot
[1:38:51] everything that you went through this
[1:38:52] week it don't matter
[1:38:55] everything you're getting ready to go
[1:38:57] through this week
[1:38:58] it don't matter he's got it
[1:39:12] and the sermon might be choosing of the
[1:39:14] bride
[1:39:16] and the pastor or whoever's preaching
[1:39:18] just starts winging his and you go start
[1:39:20] going all across the audience amen
[1:39:24] amen
[1:39:26] and you start playing your flute and
[1:39:28] you're trumpeting your trombone and you
[1:39:30] start playing you're part of the music
[1:39:36] because it's something on the inside of
[1:39:38] you playing
[1:39:39] that is greater
[1:39:42] that is greater than you yourself
[1:39:51] what does this have to do with legacy
[1:39:52] brother ryan
[1:39:55] i mentioned names here today
[1:40:01] and i've already argued with myself
[1:40:03] about it
[1:40:04] and evidently i lost
[1:40:08] that it's not right to compare one with
[1:40:11] another because that's carnal
[1:40:14] so i wasn't comparing them i was just
[1:40:16] telling you
[1:40:17] that the donny reagan and the tim pruitt
[1:40:20] and the ed biskull and the joe and each
[1:40:23] and every one of those ministers and i
[1:40:25] could mention
[1:40:26] other preachers sitting here
[1:40:28] each one of them given their opportunity
[1:40:30] to ran their race with everything that
[1:40:32] was within them
[1:40:34] now we would ask ministers to do that we
[1:40:36] want our all of us to do that
[1:40:39] give it our all
[1:40:45] i want to finish with this
[1:40:48] john wesley
[1:40:51] was turned down over and over and over
[1:40:52] again
[1:40:54] and finally he found a pastor field
[1:40:57] and not only in that pastor field he
[1:40:58] found ten thousand people
[1:41:01] that wanted to hear the word
[1:41:05] i'm thankful we've got a group of people
[1:41:07] that wants to hear the word
[1:41:09] you're not worried about
[1:41:10] church politics
[1:41:13] but we don't want it
[1:41:15] we're not worried about who and who's
[1:41:16] who's who
[1:41:19] because it don't matter
[1:41:22] if you're concerned about what somebody
[1:41:24] else is dressed like you know you've got
[1:41:26] your eyes on the wrong focus
[1:41:29] are you with me and if you're concerned
[1:41:30] with somebody else you know will they
[1:41:32] ever catch up pray for them
[1:41:35] and if they're stumbling fall and catch
[1:41:37] them by the arm and sleeve and try to
[1:41:39] help them
[1:41:42] because we're all in this together
[1:41:51] a legacy is what a man is remembered by
[1:41:58] and i don't want to be remembered as a
[1:41:59] coward
[1:42:03] and today is the first day of the next
[1:42:05] five years
[1:42:09] i want that next five years when i get
[1:42:11] there
[1:42:12] to be known as a real christian
[1:42:21] many years ago i said this
[1:42:24] take a picture
[1:42:25] of where you are now and where you will
[1:42:28] be five years from now
[1:42:35] for good measure
[1:42:37] i looked back five years ago
[1:42:40] of my own life
[1:42:43] and i was glad i was where i was five
[1:42:45] years ago
[1:42:47] preaching in the conventions
[1:42:49] i was glad to be there and stand there
[1:42:51] and i can tell you about the miracles
[1:42:53] that happened in those meetings
[1:42:55] but i can tell you about the god that
[1:42:57] lives today
[1:43:01] and you know what
[1:43:03] i may have had one of my most difficult
[1:43:05] nights last night
[1:43:07] and i may have humanly told my wife if i
[1:43:10] ever felt like not preaching today's
[1:43:13] that day
[1:43:14] yeah i told her that this morning
[1:43:18] but did i let that bother me
[1:43:22] i think not
[1:43:27] let it be said
[1:43:29] at the end of the day he shook himself
[1:43:35] and he got himself out of bed
[1:43:38] let me give you an english accent got
[1:43:40] himself out of bed
[1:43:43] and got himself ready for church
[1:43:45] and he went to church
[1:43:47] and he shook the kingdom of hell
[1:43:51] glory
[1:44:01] hallelujah
[1:44:06] hallelujah
