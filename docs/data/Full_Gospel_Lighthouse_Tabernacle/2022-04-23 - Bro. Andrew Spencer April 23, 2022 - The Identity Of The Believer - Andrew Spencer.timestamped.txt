[36:54] first john chapter five and verse one
[36:58] amen
[36:59] before we read
[37:01] from there i'd like to read this this
[37:03] quote from the ephesian church age
[37:06] brother barum said the true church of
[37:08] jesus christ the bride
[37:10] is locked into pure gold
[37:12] her righteousness
[37:14] is his righteousness
[37:16] her attributes are his own glorious
[37:19] attributes
[37:20] her identity is found in him
[37:23] and what he is she is to reflect
[37:26] and what he has she is to manifest
[37:30] there is no fault in her she is all
[37:32] glorious within and without
[37:35] from beginning to ending she is the work
[37:37] of her lord
[37:39] and all his works are perfect
[37:41] in fact in her is summed up and
[37:44] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[37:46] purpose of god how can one fathom it and
[37:49] how can one understand it though we
[37:52] cannot do that we can accept it by faith
[37:55] for our god
[37:56] hath spoken it
[37:58] first john 5 and 1 that whosoever
[38:00] believeth that jesus is the christ
[38:03] is born of god and everyone that loveth
[38:05] him
[38:06] that begot loveth him also that is
[38:08] begotten of him
[38:10] by this we know that we love the
[38:12] children of god when we love god and
[38:15] keep his commandments
[38:16] for this is the love of god that we keep
[38:19] his commandments and his commandments
[38:20] are not grievous they're not oppressive
[38:24] they're not heavy they're not burdensome
[38:26] but whatsoever for whatsoever is born of
[38:29] god overcometh the world and this is the
[38:32] victory that overcometh the world even
[38:35] our faith who is he that overcometh the
[38:37] world but he that believeth that jesus
[38:40] is the son of god may god bless his word
[38:44] he may be seated in the presence of the
[38:46] lord i'd like to speak to you for a few
[38:48] moments this evening on the identity the
[38:50] identity of
[38:52] of the believer
[38:53] and if you turn over just for for
[38:55] reading's sake just for
[38:57] over to luke chapter 24 and you can
[39:00] catch it on the board if you don't feel
[39:02] like turning there i know maybe your
[39:03] hands might be tired but it's okay to
[39:05] exercise your faith and roll that thing
[39:08] over every once in a while but luke
[39:09] chapter 24 and verse 15 and we find that
[39:13] that jesus is
[39:14] jesus as he breaks in here it's it's
[39:17] right after his resurrection that he
[39:20] that he comes to the two disciples that
[39:22] are on the road to to emmaus
[39:24] and and jesus begins to have a
[39:27] conversation with them and we'll just
[39:29] break in right here on verse 15 and it
[39:30] said that it came to pass that while
[39:33] they communed together and reasoned that
[39:35] jesus himself drew near and went with
[39:38] them but their eyes were holding that
[39:40] they should not know him and he said
[39:42] unto them what manner of communications
[39:44] are these that you have that you have
[39:47] with one another as you walk and are set
[39:50] so you find that the disciples are
[39:52] speaking uh if you go back and read
[39:54] they're speaking of the happenings of
[39:56] the events that's just taken place but
[39:59] notice what what draws jesus attention
[40:02] or what happens is that jesus draws near
[40:04] to them while they were talking with
[40:06] them and brother branham would tell us
[40:08] that then when you go to talking about
[40:09] god that god will draw near to you when
[40:12] you begin to magnify his name and
[40:14] glorify his name that when you begin to
[40:16] testify of all that he has done in your
[40:18] life that jesus will draw nigh and here
[40:21] they were they were speaking about the
[40:23] happenings of easter of what has just
[40:25] went on what they've just witnessed or
[40:27] or they thought that this would be the
[40:29] very messiah but jesus is getting ready
[40:32] to unfold or unveil the happenings of
[40:35] what really happened there what what he
[40:37] really was and and be and the bible said
[40:39] that it beginning at moses verse 27 and
[40:42] the prophets that he expounded unto them
[40:44] in all the scriptures the things
[40:46] concerning himself and they drew nigh
[40:48] into the village and and whether they
[40:50] went he made as though he would have
[40:52] gone further but they constrained him
[40:54] notice their eyes are still closed they
[40:56] don't recognize who he is but there was
[40:58] something on the inside of them that
[41:00] they constrained him saying abide with
[41:02] us for it is for towards evening and the
[41:05] day is far spent and he went in to tarry
[41:08] with them notice notice their eyes are
[41:10] still closed but something on the inside
[41:12] of them was drawing them to pull on him
[41:15] to lean on him because they they
[41:17] recognize that there's something about
[41:19] this one that they've been talking to
[41:21] they don't realize that it's the one
[41:22] that they'd hoped for they don't realize
[41:24] this is the one that they'd walk
[41:25] walk with for the past three and a half
[41:27] years they've not recognized but they've
[41:29] recognized something about the way that
[41:32] he is speaking unto them that this is
[41:34] that's just something more than just an
[41:36] a normal man that's going along the way
[41:39] this is something special about this man
[41:41] they they he's got an atmosphere about
[41:43] him that they just want to draw on just
[41:45] a little bit longer they they've walked
[41:47] all of these six and a half miles they
[41:49] walked with jesus and they and he took
[41:51] them through the scriptures all that the
[41:53] prophets had foretold of him but there
[41:55] was something showing on the inside of
[41:57] them it was an identity that was being
[41:59] attached to the one that had identified
[42:02] himself as the one that was the messiah
[42:04] and when they got him on the inside they
[42:06] began to pull on him they pulled him on
[42:08] the inside of there they said jesus i'm
[42:10] not going to let you pass me by there's
[42:12] something about you they've not known
[42:14] that this is him they've not understood
[42:16] it but they begin to pull on him and
[42:18] maybe you've walked into a service much
[42:20] like tonight maybe you don't understand
[42:22] everything but if you can just pull on
[42:24] him just for a little bit but you
[42:26] recognize there's an atmosphere in this
[42:27] building there's an atmosphere about the
[42:29] way that he handles himself and he began
[42:31] to pull on him and say god and when he
[42:34] got on the inside
[42:36] and when he gets on the inside of you
[42:38] young people when he gets there you'll
[42:40] recognize that the one that you have
[42:42] walked with that has guided you all
[42:44] throughout your life he made sure that
[42:46] you found him when you were fishing he
[42:48] made sure that you found him when you
[42:50] were going through the journey he made
[42:52] sure that he got to you when you were in
[42:54] trouble he is going to be the one
[42:56] that'll break the bread and you'll
[42:57] recognize that this was the same one
[43:00] immediately they identified
[43:03] they identified that this was the one
[43:06] are you with me the one that they hoped
[43:08] for the one that they longed for when
[43:10] they watched him do what he had done
[43:12] before
[43:14] they watched what he had done before and
[43:16] they recognized the way that he handled
[43:19] himself they watched his works and it
[43:22] identified what he was
[43:25] that amazing that his works identify who
[43:28] he is and so you can see it in the same
[43:30] way today you watch when somebody when
[43:33] you see the same power or the same
[43:35] manifestation of the holy ghost you are
[43:37] recognizing and identifying that that's
[43:40] jesus
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:42] now notice i know
[43:44] now just for just for myself just follow
[43:47] me in this just for a moment that that
[43:49] identification the word it means the act
[43:52] of making or proving to be the same
[43:56] it's the act or proving to be the same
[43:59] so when you have an identification you
[44:02] you are identifying that the one that is
[44:05] of this identification is the same
[44:08] identity it is the distinguishing
[44:10] character or a personality of an
[44:12] individual and brother branham would
[44:14] come and he would preach thousands of
[44:16] times and and not just titles but but he
[44:19] would preach entitles god identified by
[44:21] his characteristics identified with
[44:23] christ identified with the christ of all
[44:25] the ages but you listen throughout the
[44:27] message and brother branham is lacing in
[44:29] there of the identity of the believer of
[44:32] the of identified you can hear it and
[44:35] you can hear it in spiritual amnesia you
[44:36] can hear it through identified christ
[44:38] but he is attaching and he's lacing in
[44:41] there that there's somebody that you've
[44:43] got to be identified with and what was
[44:45] the prophet doing he was lacing the word
[44:48] together he was tying up those loose
[44:50] hands and he's putting there and showing
[44:52] to you that this is the one that was
[44:55] promised for this day
[44:57] so just just for this sort of on
[45:00] identification but each and every one of
[45:02] us sitting here this evening have an
[45:03] identification card
[45:06] it's an important thing when you have an
[45:07] identification card it's something that
[45:09] you have to carry if not this guy right
[45:11] here if you stop him he might if he
[45:13] stops you you might get in trouble
[45:16] but you've got to carry that card or
[45:18] maybe you maybe you've got an
[45:19] identification badge to get you into
[45:21] certain spots of your work or a badge of
[45:24] authority that's allowed you to get into
[45:26] a different place or access into a
[45:28] federal
[45:29] building or different things or or maybe
[45:31] it may be a
[45:33] maybe a passport so that you have the
[45:34] ability of crossing borders and you see
[45:38] they they snap that picture of you
[45:43] and they snap that picture of you and
[45:45] i'm trying not to be myself here just
[45:46] for a moment
[45:48] we're getting loose here just just yet
[45:53] you take that picture some of our here's
[45:55] where i'm going here's where my thoughts
[45:57] are some of our pictures that they took
[45:58] on our identification car was took a
[46:00] long time ago and it's hard to recognize
[46:04] it's hard to recognize maybe you was
[46:06] having a bad hair day or maybe
[46:08] maybe the person behind maybe behind the
[46:11] camera pushed your buttons just before
[46:12] they took that picture
[46:14] and you don't want that cop
[46:16] thinking just because you made that ugly
[46:18] face when you were taking that picture
[46:19] that you're that kind of a guy all the
[46:21] time
[46:22] really you're a smiling person but but
[46:24] how that picture how that picture is it
[46:26] identifies it that identification you
[46:28] can look on your you can look on your
[46:30] license and it tells you what your it
[46:32] tells what your color of your eyes are
[46:33] it tells you how it tells you how tall
[46:35] you are it tells you different
[46:36] characteristics whether you wear glasses
[46:39] or whether you got restrictions or
[46:41] different things but it's the
[46:42] identification that identifies the human
[46:45] being so if brother william would take
[46:47] my identification or not he'd take my
[46:49] driver's license and he bit get pulled
[46:51] over down here by the lovely elkton
[46:53] police he get pulled over and he'd show
[46:56] them they asked for his driver's license
[46:57] and his registration and he hands them
[47:00] my identification card they're gonna say
[47:02] son where did you get that plastic
[47:03] surgery at
[47:05] i mean you got six foot tall you hit me
[47:07] you're six foot two i mean
[47:09] mean come on somebody
[47:11] you're looking
[47:12] looking a whole lot better than what you
[47:13] do on that picture something is wrong
[47:18] man i wish it was that easy
[47:21] but something is out out of cater with
[47:24] if if he can't identify
[47:26] with what i am
[47:28] because he's not he he might carry my
[47:30] card
[47:33] there might be people that might carry a
[47:35] message book under their arm
[47:38] but they can't they can't handle
[47:39] themselves the way that you handle
[47:41] themselves they can't identify like you
[47:44] identify because there's something on
[47:46] the inside of you that makes this work
[47:52] you make this work i'm trying not to
[47:54] preach before i preach here but you are
[47:57] the people of the open book and you have
[48:00] the ability to make this little message
[48:03] that's so thwarted or or so the enemy
[48:06] has tried to thwart and try to push into
[48:09] a corner you're the only people with a
[48:11] badge of authority
[48:13] there's a lot of churches that try to
[48:15] put on plastic surgery and try to dress
[48:18] themselves up to make themselves look
[48:20] like the park
[48:22] but it's a life that makes the
[48:23] difference it's the life that makes it
[48:25] live out it's the life that pushes out
[48:28] because you are watching
[48:31] the same one that walks with the road to
[48:33] emmaus with those two disciples he's the
[48:35] same one that is identifying himself in
[48:38] the body of the church of the living god
[48:42] notice in spiritual amnesia he said your
[48:44] spiritual your spiritual attitude
[48:46] towards god's words identifies exactly
[48:49] where you're standing at and today we
[48:52] are living in an hour when we're when
[48:54] there's so many things of of technology
[48:56] where we're dealing with lost identities
[48:58] and stolen identities and even in this
[49:01] even in this in the south more so than
[49:04] up in the north but we're dealing with a
[49:05] people and a generation that is wanting
[49:08] to strip our heritage try to step our
[49:10] strip our statutes out of our life strip
[49:13] our rights away from us tear down our
[49:15] civil war monuments and all of those
[49:17] things but you can try all that you want
[49:19] to
[49:20] now you can try everything that you want
[49:22] to to wipe out our history and you can
[49:24] do the very best that you do but
[49:26] america's past is written and sealed in
[49:29] blood good and bad
[49:31] it's sealed in blood
[49:34] they don't want anything that happened
[49:35] back there that was that was what they
[49:37] would call offensive in today they don't
[49:40] want it showing up in this day but yet
[49:42] yet they they want to remove our history
[49:44] they want to remove our heritage but our
[49:47] past makes us better
[49:49] you look at science and what they did
[49:51] with cancer 50 years ago but you look at
[49:54] what it did today it makes us better and
[49:57] they try to move history of of slavery
[49:59] or out of our midst and say it was such
[50:02] a bad thing yes it was a bad thing but
[50:04] man didn't do it man did that it wasn't
[50:06] god that did that man make slaves
[50:10] but look if we're not learning or
[50:12] listening to our history then we are
[50:14] nothing but be mere beasts and we're not
[50:16] learning but we're simply acting like
[50:19] animals again
[50:21] and you look at this nation and you look
[50:23] at the politics of today you've got
[50:25] nothing but but people that's minds are
[50:28] blown out by the chaos of this world and
[50:31] they're inviting in a demon they're
[50:33] inviting in the abaddon to come in and
[50:36] take the throne
[50:39] and they're trying to fort out or fresh
[50:41] out our heritage but our heritage tells
[50:44] us where we came from it tells us of
[50:47] what we did wrong it makes us better
[50:50] when you start remembering about what
[50:52] jesus did for you and you start
[50:54] remembering where you fell and saying it
[50:56] does something for you
[50:59] you remember that old trick that the
[51:01] devil talked you into doing you remember
[51:03] it
[51:05] but it doesn't make you a bad person
[51:07] because the devil talks you into it it's
[51:10] temptation if you listen to him it's
[51:12] temptation if he's always talking to you
[51:15] but sin is when you give in to it
[51:19] remembrance is a powerful thing brother
[51:21] nathanael when you can remember
[51:24] you remember when when peter got up
[51:26] there when jesus told him that before
[51:28] the night's over you're gonna deny me
[51:30] three times
[51:32] but when the crowed he said oh no i
[51:35] said i won't do this there's no way that
[51:37] i'll i'll neglect you or i'll i'll deny
[51:40] you when the old man will walk away from
[51:42] you i will never walk away from you but
[51:45] when peter remembered what the lord said
[51:48] when the cockroach what did it do it
[51:51] humbled him to get to pentecost
[51:54] your past can take you to your future if
[51:57] you allow it to
[52:01] when you look at the fall
[52:03] you look at the fall when you see
[52:04] science today saying saying trying to
[52:07] look back there and trying to find the
[52:08] mess in lincoln trying to find our
[52:10] origin where man came from
[52:14] the big bang theory i say it was
[52:16] god spoke it
[52:18] boom it happened
[52:21] but they're trying to trace it back they
[52:23] trying to find that serpent tried to
[52:25] find him and tried to find his source
[52:28] but his life is still here
[52:31] and you look at at science they're
[52:32] trying to source it back of this is
[52:34] where man came from we've got the feet
[52:36] of a bear we've got the we've got the
[52:38] hands we've got the hands like an ape or
[52:40] a monkey and and
[52:41] and they say that that's where we
[52:43] originated from that's got nothing to do
[52:45] with mankind but when god made man he
[52:48] made man in his own image man was made
[52:50] as a spirit man in the beginning and
[52:53] then god formed man out of the dust of
[52:55] the earth we this ain't got nothing to
[52:57] do with our origin we came from god and
[53:00] we're going back to god
[53:01] [Applause]
[53:02] the more we go throughout this chaos of
[53:04] life i happen to believe that there are
[53:06] some people that are kind to monkeys
[53:09] they are kind of these apes they got
[53:10] monkey brains up in washington dc trying
[53:13] to push in all kinds of things
[53:16] trying to make our young girls do things
[53:18] that young boys
[53:21] they've lost their identity
[53:24] it ain't just in politics it's right
[53:26] here
[53:27] it's right here in denominations men
[53:29] have lost their identity of what god
[53:32] destined them to be in
[53:37] it lost his origin back there man lost
[53:39] his origin back there in the garden of
[53:40] eden he was made to walk and to control
[53:44] life to control nature but man lost his
[53:47] relationship he lost his communion with
[53:50] god because of sin and unbelief coming
[53:52] in
[53:53] and when god sowed his seed abel would
[53:55] have came here by the way of of
[53:58] spiritual multiplication but cain would
[54:00] have never been here
[54:02] but because satan came and he sowed his
[54:05] seed of discord of discrepancy cain was
[54:08] brought here he brought his discrepancy
[54:11] up to the word of god he brought it in
[54:14] and it's contrary to the word of god and
[54:16] it started the ball of sin rolling right
[54:18] there and the same things that you're
[54:20] seeing in the natural where men are
[54:22] being turned back to brute beast
[54:25] and the man without the holy ghost is
[54:27] nothing but a brute beast
[54:29] you watch what men are doing you watch
[54:30] what they're trying to influence our
[54:32] young children to do in schools today
[54:35] i'm gonna get a good i'm gonna get a
[54:36] little plane right here but you watch
[54:38] what they're trying to push in
[54:40] into our school systems and try to push
[54:43] into our young girls and pushing our
[54:45] young boys of making of acceptance
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:50] it's okay and they're trying to
[54:52] desensitize the morality of humanity to
[54:55] say that this is just the way that it's
[54:57] supposed to be
[54:59] i'll stand here on the word of god and
[55:01] said this is nothing but sodom again
[55:10] well you what you see in this in the
[55:12] natural you're also seeing a spiritual a
[55:14] man creating spiritual fornication going
[55:16] and getting baptized in the name of a
[55:18] father son and holy ghost that ain't got
[55:20] no power in it if you've been baptized
[55:23] in titles you have not been correctly
[55:25] baptized
[55:27] but man has lost his identity he's
[55:30] completely lost his mind
[55:32] i'm afraid that we've rolled back to the
[55:34] time of daniel again when the king of
[55:37] nebuchadnezzar went in there and he
[55:39] exalted himself up and he got under the
[55:42] spirit he got under his spirit because
[55:44] he exalted himself and god let a spirit
[55:47] come upon him and he'd come and he
[55:49] thought he was a an animal and he went
[55:51] out there and they found him he was out
[55:53] in the field eating grass like an ox he
[55:55] had long hair over him had feathers like
[55:58] an eagle and he had the heart of an
[56:00] animal because he forgot that he was a
[56:02] human being
[56:04] because man exalted himself
[56:08] i can handle this brother andrew can you
[56:10] really
[56:12] you can't handle laodicea and everything
[56:14] it throws at you
[56:16] but only the power of the living god has
[56:19] the ability to roll you back right where
[56:22] god destined you to be at
[56:24] [Applause]
[56:27] he forgot
[56:28] he forgot that he was a human being
[56:31] notice what brother branham said he said
[56:33] we sometimes forget
[56:34] sometimes that what the christian church
[56:37] is he said we act like the world that
[56:39] shows that we got spiritual amnesia but
[56:41] you don't act like the christian
[56:44] you act like the world
[56:48] you receive the heart of the world and
[56:50] it causes this
[56:54] you see what you see what they're trying
[56:56] to push is they're trying to push you
[57:01] into an animal nature
[57:04] when we've got when we've got it raising
[57:05] in our own schools
[57:11] where men have lost their identity of
[57:14] what they are of what gender they are
[57:16] where now they want to identify as a dog
[57:19] or a cat or they need a litter box in
[57:21] their school or they need a lease to
[57:23] lead them around they have lost their
[57:25] minds
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:29] fox news carried a carried a segment a
[57:32] while back
[57:33] it said young christians are leaving the
[57:35] church
[57:36] and here's why let me let me read to you
[57:38] these people that have less left the
[57:41] christian church
[57:42] why they are saying that they have left
[57:44] the church
[57:45] he said when they asked when they asked
[57:47] why they didn't believe many said their
[57:49] views about god had evolved where'd that
[57:52] come from and some reported having a
[57:55] crisis of faith
[57:56] learning about evolution once said when
[57:59] learning about evolution when i went
[58:00] away to college
[58:02] religion
[58:03] is the opiate of the people
[58:06] rational thought makes religion go out
[58:08] the window
[58:10] lack of any sort of scientific proof or
[58:13] specific evidence of a creator that's
[58:15] what they say christianity is
[58:17] it lacks that
[58:19] one said i just realized somewhere along
[58:21] the line that i didn't really believe it
[58:24] one said i'm not doing a lot more
[58:26] learning i said i'm doing a lot more
[58:28] learning and studying and kind of making
[58:30] my decisions for myself rather than
[58:33] listening to somebody else
[58:37] rather than embracing a blind or an
[58:39] unreasonable faith
[58:41] christians must develop an informed
[58:44] and forensic faith that can stand up in
[58:47] the marketplace
[58:48] of ideas
[58:51] that's the generation
[58:52] that the lukewarm church world is
[58:54] producing
[59:00] i don't want no forensic faith
[59:03] i don't want nothing that will stand up
[59:04] in the marketplace of the ideologies of
[59:07] the religions of the world nor in order
[59:10] nor on social media i don't want no
[59:12] forensic faith that can stand up into
[59:14] them or into the marketplace of of these
[59:16] homosexuals today and stand up in front
[59:19] of these of these political worlds where
[59:21] we can be we're all one
[59:24] we're not all one
[59:26] we are one under god one by his spirit
[59:29] baptized by the holy ghost there is a
[59:32] true oneness
[59:33] i don't want a forensic faith but i want
[59:36] a god-given faith that'll stand up
[59:38] toe-to-toe to the spirits of the demonic
[59:41] powers of satan's and thwart every
[59:44] demonic power
[59:46] weak pulpits produce weak churches and
[59:49] weak churches produce weak christians
[59:52] but for me and my house
[59:55] i serve god in his fullness
[1:00:00] man has lost his identity when he starts
[1:00:02] getting away from the word of god
[1:00:07] that's the kind what i've just read you
[1:00:09] is what the church world produces but
[1:00:11] let me show you our young people this is
[1:00:13] what that message produces this ain't
[1:00:16] william branham's life this is a life of
[1:00:18] jesus christ you take a look at what
[1:00:20] happened down in louisiana and i'll show
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:24] i put our young people up against joe
[1:00:27] biden donald trump and anybody in the
[1:00:30] halls of congress our young people are
[1:00:32] more powerful than any secret service
[1:00:38] we got the best of the best in the
[1:00:40] message and the message will produce
[1:00:43] jesus christ
[1:00:45] the world may have lost their identity
[1:00:47] but we have found ours in christ
[1:00:52] i have a mind of christ
[1:01:00] but notice
[1:01:02] notice
[1:01:02] when jesus came he didn't identify
[1:01:04] himself by traditions he didn't identify
[1:01:07] himself by the robes of humanity or the
[1:01:09] religions of the day or their creeds but
[1:01:11] he identified himself by the word and
[1:01:14] the word was his weapon and when jesus
[1:01:16] was here he didn't leave he didn't leave
[1:01:19] any question who he was he clearly
[1:01:21] identified
[1:01:23] by himself by the scriptures he said i
[1:01:25] am the resurrection and the life i am
[1:01:28] before abraham was i am moses spoke of
[1:01:32] me i am my father a one when pilate
[1:01:35] asked him said are you a king he said
[1:01:37] thou sayest
[1:01:40] judas had to testify that this was an
[1:01:43] innocent one pilate had to wash his head
[1:01:46] tried to wash his hands of him
[1:01:48] they testified that this was him
[1:01:52] there was no questions
[1:01:54] satan satan may have had his ideas but
[1:01:57] jesus clearly identified himself by the
[1:01:59] scriptures
[1:02:02] what did we do we took the badge of the
[1:02:04] prophets of the old testament we looked
[1:02:06] at what they said we took their id badge
[1:02:09] we looked at what they said the messiah
[1:02:11] would be and we looked at the person
[1:02:16] he was everything that they said that he
[1:02:18] would be jesus was so much god that
[1:02:22] sickness couldn't stand in his presence
[1:02:24] jesus was so much god that death was
[1:02:27] arrested jesus was so much god that
[1:02:30] lazarus couldn't stay in a grave jesus
[1:02:32] was so much god that hell couldn't stop
[1:02:35] him jesus was so much god that the grave
[1:02:38] couldn't contain him
[1:02:41] i'll say this that that same jesus is
[1:02:44] living in a people identified once again
[1:02:47] you are identified by the message
[1:02:50] for rapture
[1:02:58] i got my identification card
[1:03:00] that i carry
[1:03:02] and they try to do it they're trying to
[1:03:04] do a thing
[1:03:05] in the state of virginia i guess it's
[1:03:06] everywhere but what they call a real id
[1:03:10] and if you fly domestically or if you
[1:03:12] gotta get into certain federal buildings
[1:03:15] you have to have that to be able to get
[1:03:17] in or to fly domestically but i want you
[1:03:20] to know i found my real id when they
[1:03:22] give me that real id i thought man i got
[1:03:24] myself a subject to preach right now
[1:03:27] this is my real id i can lose that card
[1:03:32] i can lose that card it might get rolled
[1:03:35] up or crack and put into the trash but i
[1:03:37] can't lose this identity my seed is my
[1:03:40] identity my birth is my identity my holy
[1:03:43] ghost is my identity this is my real
[1:03:46] idea
[1:03:49] and jesus when he up went up there on
[1:03:52] the amount of temptation and satan put
[1:03:54] towards him those temptations
[1:03:58] he didn't use his power brother jeffrey
[1:04:00] he used the word
[1:04:02] he's not wanting you to use your power
[1:04:04] sister jada he's simply wanting you to
[1:04:06] use the word of god against every critic
[1:04:09] against every demon of hell
[1:04:15] hallelujah
[1:04:18] jesus did it in such a way
[1:04:21] that when the weakest of christian goes
[1:04:23] on their knees
[1:04:25] when you've got a problem that's bigger
[1:04:27] than you
[1:04:29] i am the lord thy god that heals all of
[1:04:31] your diseases
[1:04:32] you ain't got to feel no emotion about
[1:04:34] it you ain't got to get excited about it
[1:04:37] it will excite you and it will get you
[1:04:39] emotional but there's going to be some
[1:04:40] bad days in your future
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:47] well
[1:04:49] i'm not going to listen to you you're
[1:04:51] going to need this one day
[1:04:54] you can sit there and roll your eyes at
[1:04:55] me all you want to but you're going to
[1:04:57] need this one day you're not going to
[1:04:59] feel
[1:05:00] it's going to be sometimes young people
[1:05:02] when you don't feel like shouting and
[1:05:04] running all over the building that
[1:05:06] you're going to need the lord thy god
[1:05:07] that heals all your diseases
[1:05:09] you're gonna need to know
[1:05:13] that jesus
[1:05:15] he was up there fast he was up there
[1:05:17] fasting he was up there hungering
[1:05:21] it wouldn't have been temptation
[1:05:24] if he wouldn't have been hungry
[1:05:27] he had the power to do it he had the
[1:05:29] ability to do it
[1:05:32] but because of you
[1:05:34] but because of you
[1:05:37] notice you look what jesus what satan
[1:05:39] did when he assailed on jesus a prayer
[1:05:41] notice what jesus did he did not give
[1:05:44] him it
[1:05:45] it's by this or i'll show you my i'll
[1:05:47] flex my muscles at you no
[1:05:50] it was i it is written
[1:05:57] amen
[1:06:00] and the demons that you face young
[1:06:01] people are designed to attack you
[1:06:04] they're designed to press against you
[1:06:06] and they're designed to work against all
[1:06:08] of those that press towards god's word
[1:06:10] and you watch the religious spirits of
[1:06:12] the day
[1:06:13] it's easy believism of i've got it or i
[1:06:16] felt emotional but you watch that demon
[1:06:19] will work on your flesh he'll work on
[1:06:21] your spirit
[1:06:24] but he cannot get to that soul
[1:06:27] if you got what you really got if you
[1:06:29] really got an identification that i am
[1:06:31] birthed by the word of god
[1:06:33] satan can throw cancer on you but it
[1:06:35] won't stop you satan can throw all kinds
[1:06:37] of diseases on you but it won't stop you
[1:06:40] it's not by might it's not my power but
[1:06:44] by my spirit saith the lord
[1:06:48] we got religious spirits against us
[1:06:50] we've got every demonic gun of hell
[1:06:52] that's pointed against the church of the
[1:06:54] living god
[1:06:55] and you watch the roman empire that's
[1:06:57] revived its ideology again and working
[1:07:00] its way into the methodist you look what
[1:07:02] the method has got in their pulpit
[1:07:07] you look what they're inviting into
[1:07:08] their pulpit you look what the catholic
[1:07:10] church is doing to those young boys
[1:07:14] you look what they're doing to those
[1:07:15] nuns back there
[1:07:17] men have brainwashed the society of
[1:07:20] christianity and they've lost their
[1:07:22] identity
[1:07:24] and satan come up out of that bottomless
[1:07:26] pit he has no foundation and he is
[1:07:28] simply attacking the value of the word
[1:07:30] of god and he's trying to strip you
[1:07:34] of your heritage
[1:07:36] it's for days gone by it's for those
[1:07:38] young people it was just for the
[1:07:40] generation before you it's not for you
[1:07:43] but ain't god good
[1:07:46] he so designed these promises that they
[1:07:49] never run out they ain't got an
[1:07:51] expiration date on them it doesn't say
[1:07:53] just for andrew spencer just for william
[1:07:56] branham it says for the church of the
[1:07:58] living god whosoever believeth
[1:08:02] oh do we got any believers in the house
[1:08:04] of god today
[1:08:09] god is the designer
[1:08:11] of the body
[1:08:12] he built that body he built this earthly
[1:08:14] body with with with channels to be able
[1:08:17] to reach out and contact the earthly
[1:08:19] world
[1:08:20] senses that brother william talked about
[1:08:22] last weekend reaching out but he's also
[1:08:25] the designer of the church body
[1:08:27] and he placed in the church body gifts
[1:08:29] of speaking in tongues gifts of prophecy
[1:08:32] gifts of wisdom gifts of knowledge gifts
[1:08:34] of healing
[1:08:36] he designed man's body
[1:08:39] so certainly he can design the church
[1:08:42] church's body is that right
[1:08:46] and he lets the power work through the
[1:08:48] body
[1:08:49] and something works through the body and
[1:08:50] it tells something in their natural
[1:08:52] flesh and tell something's wrong
[1:08:55] anybody can attest to something maybe
[1:08:57] something down in your foot and man all
[1:08:58] of a sudden it sends a shock up to your
[1:09:00] head something's wrong
[1:09:03] and god has so designed the body that
[1:09:05] there's a pastor over top of a sheep
[1:09:08] that he knows when something is wrong he
[1:09:10] can stand there and take his god-given
[1:09:12] gift and speak the word of god
[1:09:15] and watch the power roll through the
[1:09:17] channels of the word and bring that
[1:09:19] situation bring peace to it
[1:09:25] but notice
[1:09:27] notice
[1:09:28] god lets out his power and lets it out
[1:09:31] his revelation to the people he said and
[1:09:34] not as an individual so much but as a
[1:09:36] unit we're all together one great body
[1:09:38] of believers how do we get into the body
[1:09:40] of this mystic body by one spirit we're
[1:09:42] all baptized but notice this he said
[1:09:44] satan by the laws of sin and death makes
[1:09:46] everything that sin
[1:09:48] death brought
[1:09:49] operate
[1:09:52] sin and death makes everything that sin
[1:09:54] and death brought operate
[1:09:56] to satan
[1:09:57] he sends cancer
[1:09:59] and the man recognized it and received
[1:10:02] it
[1:10:02] satan sends hard acts heart attacks or
[1:10:05] heartaches he said we recognize it and
[1:10:08] we receive it
[1:10:09] he said but if satan can make his laws
[1:10:12] be sure and us recognize it how much
[1:10:14] more ought god to his children to make
[1:10:16] his laws recognized be recognized among
[1:10:19] his people of divine healing of
[1:10:21] revelation of power gifts and
[1:10:22] manifestation of the spirit he said the
[1:10:24] law of sin and death works in the people
[1:10:30] so if
[1:10:31] humanity
[1:10:33] works
[1:10:35] by the laws of sin and death
[1:10:37] and man sent cancer and we recognize it
[1:10:40] or satan sends cancer a man recognizes
[1:10:42] it man receives it that surely god ought
[1:10:45] to have his spiritual body
[1:10:49] in operation
[1:10:50] to be able to receive the law of the
[1:10:52] liberty of jesus christ
[1:10:55] is that right
[1:10:56] we ought to be able to get into a spot
[1:10:58] where we recognize and we receive every
[1:11:01] promise of god
[1:11:03] we ought to be able to get ourselves in
[1:11:04] condition so that we can recognize that
[1:11:07] this is not just for days gone by but
[1:11:10] this is for the church of the living god
[1:11:14] power work the works of the body but god
[1:11:16] this ain't just paul's day this is your
[1:11:19] day
[1:11:21] [Music]
[1:11:27] we're living in an hour and an age
[1:11:29] where it's
[1:11:31] it's a spirit of depression on the
[1:11:32] people
[1:11:35] it's a spirit of barrenness on the
[1:11:36] people it's a spirit of depression and
[1:11:38] you see every demonic power of hell
[1:11:41] rising out of the river euphrates
[1:11:45] but never speak his language
[1:11:52] my depression
[1:11:54] my fear
[1:11:56] my complexes
[1:11:59] my stigmas
[1:12:03] we're not to speak his language
[1:12:05] when they were up there on the day of
[1:12:07] pentecost they come out and their whole
[1:12:08] entire language was quickened
[1:12:12] everything was quickened and when you
[1:12:14] are birthed by the word of god
[1:12:16] everything changes
[1:12:18] i want you to change your language
[1:12:20] it ain't
[1:12:22] he said oh i just wish i'd speak in
[1:12:24] tongues just get your language changed
[1:12:26] it's not my fear it's not my depression
[1:12:29] it's not my cancer it's not my sugar
[1:12:33] it's not my problem
[1:12:35] my god
[1:12:37] my hope
[1:12:38] my strength my abilities
[1:12:42] change your language over to the
[1:12:44] identity of the church of the living god
[1:12:48] my identity is not in satan my identity
[1:12:50] is not in complex yes my identity is not
[1:12:53] in depression my identity is not in
[1:12:55] suicide my depression it's not my
[1:12:58] depression
[1:12:59] fearing my identity
[1:13:03] troubles ain't my identity hell ain't my
[1:13:06] identity heaven is my identity god is my
[1:13:09] identity
[1:13:10] [Applause]
[1:13:13] if you're american you're identified
[1:13:15] with patrick henry you're identified
[1:13:17] with george washington you're identified
[1:13:19] with with the ones that came across
[1:13:24] if you really are an american citizen
[1:13:26] you'll bleed for america you'll die for
[1:13:29] america
[1:13:31] but the problem with the american people
[1:13:33] today we don't have americans we've got
[1:13:35] people that have been implanted
[1:13:38] hey if i if i was them i'd want to move
[1:13:40] here too and i'm not against that this
[1:13:42] is america

[1:13:46] here if i was over there i'd do
[1:13:48] everything within my power to get here
[1:13:50] we just got a government that's stupid
[1:13:52] enough to pay for everything that they
[1:13:54] ain't doing
[1:13:59] but if you're an american you're
[1:14:00] american to your accord
[1:14:03] you can't shake it out of you
[1:14:09] i'll stand for that flag
[1:14:12] as long as i got along i got air in my
[1:14:14] lungs
[1:14:19] but i'm afraid
[1:14:20] that america is past praying for
[1:14:26] but i have found myself
[1:14:28] in something that i will die for i it's
[1:14:30] not just good enough to have a death bed
[1:14:32] confession it's good enough to live by
[1:14:35] it's good enough to die by it's good
[1:14:37] enough to fight by

[1:14:54] fighting abuse i'll fight whatever i
[1:14:56] gotta fight at
[1:14:59] satan can push his identity and try to
[1:15:02] move it into our young people but i'll
[1:15:04] stand here by the holy ghost power of
[1:15:06] god and said satan not today not this
[1:15:10] young group not this church
[1:15:14] we've got some young people that are
[1:15:16] worth fighting for
[1:15:19] we've got a message that's worth living
[1:15:25] hallelujah
[1:15:27] i said hallelujah
[1:15:28] [Applause]
[1:15:36] satan's got his agenda
[1:15:38] he's got his attack
[1:15:40] and he's thrown every rock of offense at
[1:15:42] us
[1:15:44] you got to allow the holy ghost to be
[1:15:45] your keeper
[1:15:49] parents you got to step up and you got

[1:17:03] willing to say i'm not going after her
[1:17:04] to that trash i'm not going out there

[1:17:12] a young girl that refused to walk out to
[1:17:14] the world and say i'm not going to be a
