[26:27] this every time Lord I just I can't help
[26:30] but testify briefly for something really
[26:33] special this week
[26:35] this is special to me as if God had
[26:37] healed me
[26:38] I went to dinner with an associate and
[26:42] actually it was the gentleman that was
[26:43] on the plane
[26:45] the one that brother Ron refers to as
[26:48] quite talkative
[26:49] he's a special special friend associate
[26:53] him and his wife and somehow another
[26:55] sitting there my wife just happened to
[26:57] for what reason I don't know mentioned
[26:59] that I go to church in Tennessee and
[27:01] then I go to church now I hear some and
[27:03] puzzlelook comes across my friend's
[27:06] wife's face and she's kind of like
[27:09] what's different you know it's four
[27:12] hours and uh they're they're precious
[27:14] people in the denominational world and I
[27:18] often say to the Lord Lord I'm not a
[27:20] minister I don't even want to begin to
[27:22] Broach that it's not my calling I'm not
[27:24] qualified but I remember brother Ron
[27:26] recently in the sermon it was a simple
[27:28] thing but it hit me in the heart and
[27:30] that's just living live it but that
[27:32] living it draws questions dropping four
[27:35] hours to go to service when I live in
[27:37] Raleigh Durham North Carolina and I just
[27:39] quick as she said that I just I I just
[27:42] felt that her prayers rushing God that
[27:44] prayer I pray so much talk for me say
[27:46] something say something because I don't
[27:48] know what to say and I actually looked
[27:49] at her and I just said you know well
[27:51] that that's a honestly I don't even know
[27:53] if I know how to answer you and then all
[27:55] of a sudden it happened it just happened
[27:57] and I referenced brother wrong I said
[27:59] I thought about the plane story I told
[28:02] it to my friend
[28:03] and last week when I stood back there at
[28:06] the back I said that Ministry there is
[28:08] so touched of God I said I prayed a
[28:10] prayer God that brother Ron would call
[28:12] me to the front and pray for my son and
[28:14] 30 seconds later he did that and I said
[28:17] we don't put man above anybody I said
[28:19] we've got a Ministry that we follow his
[28:21] name's brother Branham I said people
[28:23] followed Martin Luther followed this and
[28:25] and I just said two or three more things
[28:27] and she said I get it I get it I said we
[28:30] we we we don't have a memorized prayer
[28:33] we don't have this and you know I just
[28:35] wanted to follow my knees in front of
[28:36] the Lord right there and say thank you
[28:38] thank you that I was able to say
[28:40] something that didn't sound like I was
[28:41] trying to be anybody because I'm not I
[28:44] thank him for giving me the words

[48:09] Stephen to sing
[48:12] because this is this is Christmas
[48:15] this song right here embodies the very
[48:18] power of Christmas
[48:22] and I'd like to read this portion of
[48:24] scripture Revelations chapter 5.
[48:28] verse 7.
[48:31] and he came and took the book out of the
[48:33] right hand of him that set upon the
[48:35] throne
[48:36] and when he had taken the book The Four
[48:38] beasts and Four and Twenty Elders fell
[48:41] down before the lamb having every one of
[48:43] them Harps golden vials full of odors
[48:46] which are the prayers of the Saints
[48:49] and they sung a new song
[48:51] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[48:54] and open the seals thereof
[48:57] for thou was slain has redeemed us to
[48:59] God by the blood
[49:00] of every Kindred tongue people and
[49:04] Nation
[49:05] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[49:08] Priests and we shall reign on the Earth
[49:11] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[49:13] many angels round about the throne and
[49:16] beasts and the elders and a number of
[49:18] them was Ten Thousand Times Ten
[49:21] thousands and thousands of thousands
[49:23] saying with a loud voice Worthy
[49:27] is the Lamb that was slain to receive
[49:30] power and riches and wisdom and strength
[49:33] and honor and glory and blessing and
[49:36] every creature which is in heaven on the
[49:38] earth and under the Earth such are in
[49:41] the sea and all that in them heard I
[49:44] saying blessing honor glory and power be
[49:47] unto him that sitteth upon the throne
[49:50] unto the lamb forever and ever and the
[49:53] four beasts said amen and the Four and
[49:55] Twenty Elders fell down and worshiped
[49:57] him that liveth forever and ever
[50:01] the choir song that you're about to hear
[50:05] [Music]
[50:08] a song that the kegleys came with their
[50:09] heart on their heart to sing Holy
[50:12] forever I believe we've stepped into a
[50:15] vision this weekend we didn't just come
[50:17] here for just to be here we come here
[50:19] with a purpose in mind and God sees
[50:21] everything and if the angels can keep
[50:24] singing a new song unto him and the
[50:26] elders can sing a new song and all those
[50:28] that are around the throne heard John
[50:30] say it blessings honor glory and worship
[50:33] be unto the Lamb of God I'll say we
[50:36] ought to be able to lift up our soul and
[50:38] lift up our voices under the god that is
[50:41] Holy forever what you're not what you're
[50:44] hearing is not a duplicate of a song
[50:46] what you're hearing is a worship to the
[50:48] lamb the lamb who is worthy of all of
[50:51] our praise we'll never get tired of
[50:54] worshiping him we'll never grow weary of
[50:56] worshiping him he is worthy of Our
[50:59] Praise he is Holy Holy forever God bless

[1:24:35] I want to read I want to read a quote to
[1:24:37] you I think you'll find very very
[1:24:39] wonderful
[1:24:41] I'm just like brother Neville
[1:24:44] I just can't wait till Christmas
[1:24:48] to open up that present and you know
[1:24:50] once in the once the man or once a man
[1:24:53] twice a child
[1:24:57] a child well I feel that same way don't
[1:24:58] you
[1:25:00] but I certainly think brother Neville
[1:25:01] looks nice in his new suit
[1:25:05] I got one of the prettiest overcoats
[1:25:07] that I've ever seen in my life from this
[1:25:09] church down here
[1:25:11] and I certainly appreciate it
[1:25:13] I thank you
[1:25:15] for judging me a little a little bit
[1:25:17] bigger than than what I really am
[1:25:23] but I believe that they'll get one
[1:25:25] just a little bit smaller tomorrow
[1:25:29] brother Brown was never over 150 pounds
[1:25:32] so
[1:25:33] it's just a little bit too big too much
[1:25:36] of a coat for a man
[1:25:40] it is to cover
[1:25:44] so you heard in the Bible where the
[1:25:47] blanket was too short for the men or the
[1:25:49] bed so so it's just about also that same
[1:25:54] way
[1:25:55] and here this is with me and the coat
[1:25:59] was just a little bit large
[1:26:00] but it's certainly pretty
[1:26:03] and I hope they can get me one there
[1:26:05] that's maybe just a number smaller
[1:26:10] and that will fit me real good and I'll
[1:26:13] wear it out
[1:26:15] to show
[1:26:16] like he did there
[1:26:19] he said I have seen the time where I
[1:26:22] have preached with the Overcoat on
[1:26:25] he said glad to have it on
[1:26:28] well I haven't had a good Overcoat all
[1:26:31] my life this is the first time I've ever
[1:26:34] owned a good Overcoat I don't like to be
[1:26:37] nerd about it
[1:26:40] I just wonder if this church can
[1:26:42] remember my first going away from the
[1:26:44] church and you remember
[1:26:46] what it was the night when I went down
[1:26:49] to St Louis from the church to visit
[1:26:51] brother Robert Doherty's daughter
[1:26:53] and brother and sister Spencer
[1:26:56] I guess you can remember brother Roy
[1:26:58] Slaughter is here many of them I didn't
[1:27:02] even have a coat at all
[1:27:04] and the church mate gave me a made up
[1:27:08] eleven dollars for my ticket and I
[1:27:11] barred my brother's Overcoat and it was
[1:27:14] just about twice too big for me and I
[1:27:17] packed it because it looked so bad for
[1:27:21] for me to wear it and and then I looked
[1:27:24] I looked bad not to have any at all so I
[1:27:29] packed it and when I got over there
[1:27:31] there was a couple of days and the Lord
[1:27:33] began to move
[1:27:35] and healed little Betty I think you'll
[1:27:38] like this part and you know I I seen her
[1:27:41] not long ago and she's a beautiful young
[1:27:43] woman now
[1:27:44] and she had Saint Vitus dance
[1:27:48] and just laying there like an animal
[1:27:50] jerking backwards and forwards for the
[1:27:53] days and days
[1:27:54] and the best of doctors had given up
[1:27:58] and I stayed that day in that evening
[1:28:00] and the Lord showed me a vision just on
[1:28:03] what to do
[1:28:05] and said little Betty would be delivered
[1:28:08] as soon as they did that and I told the
[1:28:12] minister and his father to stand and I
[1:28:16] said to the lady
[1:28:18] you was in the city the other day buying
[1:28:21] little pants
[1:28:23] and you bought one that's blue Granite
[1:28:26] pan
[1:28:27] and it's sitting in your cabinets down
[1:28:31] beneath
[1:28:32] you've not moved it since that you put
[1:28:35] it in there
[1:28:36] she said that's right
[1:28:38] go get it and fill it with water and
[1:28:40] bring that little white towel and come
[1:28:43] here for thus saith the Lord little
[1:28:46] Betty is getting ready to be healed
[1:28:50] amen a whole lot in that quote isn't it
[1:28:54] amen any good to us
[1:28:56] we certainly love him certainly enjoyed
[1:28:59] last night if you haven't heard it go
[1:29:01] back and listen to it the vision of
[1:29:04] Christmas and amen you got a little
[1:29:06] vision of what it was 2 000 years ago
[1:29:09] and you got a vision of what it's like
[1:29:10] in our home and
[1:29:12] amen and and we certainly we certainly
[1:29:15] are thankful for God and His blessings
[1:29:17] on our lives and we we drew trust that
[1:29:21] you have a very merry merry Christmas
[1:29:23] and so amen if that's kind of against
[1:29:26] your religion if you look that up
[1:29:28] brother Brahm said that about 400 times
[1:29:30] and so I think it'll work out real well
[1:29:34] Isaiah chapter 49 and verse 7.
[1:29:39] and then Isaiah 9 and 6.
[1:29:43] hey man thank you for your standing I'm
[1:29:46] I'll stand a little bit longer than what
[1:29:48] you have today but amen certainly
[1:29:51] appreciate your prayers for me over the
[1:29:53] last couple days have been a little bit
[1:29:54] rough and and uh I didn't leave last
[1:29:57] night I just went in the back and sat
[1:29:59] down for a bit and listened to the
[1:30:01] service certainly enjoyed the rubber
[1:30:03] being eaten off of some bicycle tires
[1:30:06] and so so sister Judy just in case you
[1:30:08] you notice that the Mennonites don't
[1:30:11] have any rubbers on their bicycles so
[1:30:13] you'll understand that Gabe's been
[1:30:15] eating the rubber off of those things
[1:30:16] and so
[1:30:19] amen I want to speak to you on Mary
[1:30:24] Mary
[1:30:26] two births
[1:30:31] Isaiah chapter 49 and verse 7. thus
[1:30:34] saith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel
[1:30:38] and His Holy One
[1:30:40] to whom man despiseth
[1:30:44] to him whom the nation at horeth
[1:30:48] to a servant of rulers
[1:30:50] King shall see and arise princes also
[1:30:55] shall worship because of the Lord
[1:30:58] that is faithful
[1:31:00] and the Holy One of Israel
[1:31:03] and he shall choose thee thus saith the
[1:31:06] Lord in an acceptable time have I heard
[1:31:09] thee and in the day of salvation have I
[1:31:12] helped thee and I will preserve thee and
[1:31:15] give thee for a covenant of the people
[1:31:17] to establish the Earth to cause to
[1:31:21] inherit the desolate heritages
[1:31:25] Isaiah chapter 9 and verse 6 very
[1:31:28] familiar to us for unto us
[1:31:31] a child is born
[1:31:34] unto us a son is given and the
[1:31:37] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:31:39] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:31:43] counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting
[1:31:47] father the Prince of Peace you may be
[1:31:51] seated and we all say Amen
[1:32:14] Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14.
[1:32:18] that sounds better
[1:32:19] therefore the Lord shall
[1:32:23] himself shall give you a sign
[1:32:27] behold
[1:32:29] a virgin
[1:32:32] shall conceive
[1:32:34] and bear a son
[1:32:37] and shall call his name
[1:32:39] Emmanuel
[1:32:41] I want you to just think just for a
[1:32:43] moment Isaiah is a prophet
[1:32:46] he's a seer
[1:32:48] he is the spokesman of God
[1:32:51] and when God speaks something it may be
[1:32:53] hundreds of years before it comes to
[1:32:56] pass
[1:32:57] when Isaiah speaks this to his audience
[1:33:00] and he writes it down no doubt science
[1:33:03] says it can never happen
[1:33:07] a virgin can never conceive
[1:33:10] and bear for sure a son
[1:33:15] and then you're saying that this son is
[1:33:19] going to be God
[1:33:24] I want to carry you to Matthew chapter
[1:33:27] 1.
[1:33:28] and Jacob begat Joseph
[1:33:32] the husband of Mary
[1:33:35] of whom was born
[1:33:37] Jesus
[1:33:40] who is the Christ
[1:33:42] that's enough that's called Christ
[1:33:44] that's enough to just preach and Shout
[1:33:46] for a while
[1:33:48] now this is very familiar to us and
[1:33:51] verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ
[1:33:54] was on this wise
[1:33:56] and when as his mother Mary was espoused
[1:33:59] to Joseph
[1:34:01] spoken for
[1:34:03] before they came together you as adults
[1:34:06] understand what we're saying she was
[1:34:09] found with child of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:13] not a third person in the godhead
[1:34:16] but God's spirit came down and began to
[1:34:19] speak to her
[1:34:21] and Joseph her husband be an adjust man
[1:34:24] and not willing to make her a public
[1:34:27] example was minded to put her away
[1:34:30] privately you're talking about the
[1:34:32] strain of humanity
[1:34:35] you know Mary today has statues all over
[1:34:37] the world
[1:34:39] beautiful statues almost breathtaking
[1:34:43] statues all over the world but in that
[1:34:45] day she was a very disdained
[1:34:49] a lot of rumors was going around a lot
[1:34:52] of tail bearing was going around
[1:34:55] and if they could have they would have
[1:34:58] stoned her because they had scriptures
[1:35:00] to do it
[1:35:02] but there was also a prophecy that had
[1:35:05] circled the Earth for hundreds of years
[1:35:07] a virgin shall conceive
[1:35:11] Mary didn't do this of him of of herself
[1:35:14] she was elected of God chosen of God no
[1:35:19] more than you became bride of your own
[1:35:22] self
[1:35:24] you were elected of God and chosen of
[1:35:28] God you can't make yourself bride
[1:35:32] you have to be chosen
[1:35:36] and Mary was very much made fun of
[1:35:40] and listen she met an angel of God
[1:35:46] on a very busy Street
[1:35:49] nobody else saw the angel but Mary
[1:35:54] Dusty Little Road God ordained to meet
[1:35:57] her in a certain place Andrew spoken
[1:36:00] about it last night brother Branham
[1:36:02] speaks in Mary's belief might be good
[1:36:04] something to go listen to this week in
[1:36:07] Mary's belief brother Brown said they
[1:36:09] went to service and the rabbi took of
[1:36:12] the scripture of all of the scriptures
[1:36:15] that he took of and he put the scroll
[1:36:16] out and he read Isaiah
[1:36:19] Behold a virgin shall conceive and he
[1:36:22] said something pricked in their hearts
[1:36:26] something moved on the inside of him how
[1:36:28] many thousand times had that scripture
[1:36:30] been read but today the seed the womb
[1:36:34] was on the scene at the right time no
[1:36:37] doubt a lot of virgins and a lot of
[1:36:39] priests had looked at their daughters
[1:36:41] and said maybe she's the one but this
[1:36:44] girl
[1:36:45] that was not in the who's who that was
[1:36:48] not in a priest lineage but she came
[1:36:51] from the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:36:54] and God had chose her virgin womb to be
[1:36:59] born in
[1:37:00] not part Mary
[1:37:05] but God created his own germ seat
[1:37:09] his own life
[1:37:11] it was all God on the inside of her womb
[1:37:18] Mary began to to speak of her her her
[1:37:22] visitation
[1:37:24] it caused Joseph much trouble what will
[1:37:28] I do with it
[1:37:29] and Joseph had to have a visitation
[1:37:32] himself
[1:37:35] he had to have a visitation himself
[1:37:37] because now he would be connected with
[1:37:41] the testimony
[1:37:43] as long as you're miles away you know
[1:37:46] the testimony don't look too hard two
[1:37:49] thousand years later everybody can
[1:37:51] worship the baby at the manger
[1:37:56] but nobody wanted to have him born in
[1:37:59] their Church
[1:38:01] nobody no hospital wanted the baby born
[1:38:04] at their place it would cause much
[1:38:07] damage to their reputation but God had a
[1:38:11] Manger
[1:38:14] God had a Manger that was built with
[1:38:18] cattle and sheep and donkeys
[1:38:27] the Stars lined up
[1:38:30] Shepherds were moved and heard Angels
[1:38:33] Sing
[1:38:35] I heard a great denominational preacher
[1:38:37] preach a few years ago on the radio I
[1:38:40] just just happened to go across it and
[1:38:42] he said Angels never have sung I said I
[1:38:46] literally talked back to the radio and I
[1:38:48] said forgive me
[1:38:51] 2 000 years ago Angels sang they've been
[1:38:55] singing since the dawn of time holy holy
[1:38:58] holy holy holy
[1:39:04] if you listen close Angels sing in this
[1:39:08] building
[1:39:13] brother Chris and Sister Mary sent me
[1:39:16] something this week
[1:39:18] literally the recording of angels
[1:39:20] singing
[1:39:23] angels in a higher octave
[1:39:25] when nobody else was singing sing a
[1:39:28] verse
[1:39:29] it was beautiful I know how many times
[1:39:31] I've already played it I like to hear
[1:39:34] Angels Sing
[1:39:35] in this season they sank
[1:39:39] to Shepherds
[1:39:43] they didn't sing to Kings potentates
[1:39:46] great degrees of people rich people they
[1:39:50] went to people that would hear his voice
[1:39:57] his name Shall be Called Jesus
[1:40:00] no doubt there was a lot of jesuses in
[1:40:03] that day
[1:40:04] Jesus means
[1:40:07] Yahweh or Joshua
[1:40:10] Yahweh is salvation
[1:40:13] Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua
[1:40:17] that name the name of Jesus is the sum
[1:40:20] total of all Jehovah was in the Old
[1:40:24] Testament
[1:40:26] did you get that
[1:40:28] the name of Jesus is the sum total of
[1:40:32] all
[1:40:34] that Jehovah was in the Old Testament
[1:40:38] Jehovah in the Old Testament became
[1:40:40] Jesus in the new
[1:40:43] he did not come as a great priest or a
[1:40:46] great king he came to Earth as a baby
[1:40:50] no doubt Satan could watch God condensed
[1:40:53] sand and all the way down
[1:40:55] as he calmed and sinned it in Abraham
[1:40:58] and Noah in Moses in Joshua in David in
[1:41:06] Solomon
[1:41:08] and it was moving from one Prophet to
[1:41:11] another God was condescending through
[1:41:13] the Old Testament and no doubt Satan was
[1:41:17] watching when when God would come on the
[1:41:20] Earth
[1:41:21] prophecy had been told over and over and
[1:41:24] over and over and over again
[1:41:27] but God hid it from Lucifer
[1:41:33] how much has he hid you from Lucifer
[1:41:36] he would take your life if he could
[1:41:39] no doubt he whispers in your ear a lot
[1:41:41] of nonsense he would take you if he
[1:41:44] could he would take me if it could
[1:41:47] but God hid that seed of eternal life
[1:41:51] from the Devil
[1:41:56] there's a lot of religions in the world
[1:41:58] but there's one
[1:42:01] there's a bride on the earth that's
[1:42:03] worldwide not just in a little old group
[1:42:06] here but worldwide around the world that
[1:42:10] has saw the angel of God let us met the
[1:42:13] angel for themselves
[1:42:15] that Holy Ghost is a personal revelation
[1:42:18] to them
[1:42:23] persecution comes when you begin to
[1:42:25] testify that he lives in your heart
[1:42:28] when he lives in your manger
[1:42:33] Mary started get persecution
[1:42:38] when her robe
[1:42:40] began to fill out
[1:42:45] as long as it was just a testimony
[1:42:49] she's just a simple little girl
[1:42:52] talking about an angel's visitation
[1:42:55] she's not married
[1:42:57] and before long
[1:43:00] it's beginning to fill out
[1:43:03] she didn't produce that
[1:43:06] she was just carrying it
[1:43:12] you didn't produce the life
[1:43:15] you just said be it unto me according to
[1:43:18] Thy Word
[1:43:20] and you surrendered yourself to the word
[1:43:22] of God
[1:43:24] and it began to show on you
[1:43:29] it just began to show on you you didn't
[1:43:32] have to make yourself do anything you
[1:43:35] just ate
[1:43:37] you just ate and the word produces
[1:43:40] itself the word produces word the word
[1:43:45] produces life
[1:43:49] you come to church you say Amen to it
[1:43:53] and they for long your music change your
[1:43:56] desires change
[1:43:59] your closet changes
[1:44:05] things that you had all over you it
[1:44:07] changes pain on your nails it changes
[1:44:11] the hair changes men become men
[1:44:19] become men
[1:44:21] women become a ladies
[1:44:24] greens of homes
[1:44:28] and what you thought you had to paint
[1:44:30] yourself up to look attractive to the
[1:44:32] world was not attractive to our God and
[1:44:35] now you're you find out that you're more
[1:44:38] beautiful now with all of that hanging
[1:44:40] on you but now there's a character
[1:44:46] there's a character inside of you
[1:44:55] the Lord our creator
[1:44:58] the Lord the most high God
[1:45:00] the owner the Lord the master the Lord
[1:45:04] the Everlasting the Lord the provider
[1:45:07] the Lord the Healer the Lord the banner
[1:45:10] the Lord the miracle the Lord our
[1:45:14] sanctification the Lord our peace the
[1:45:17] Lord the judge the Lord of hosts the
[1:45:21] Lord our righteousness the Lord the
[1:45:23] shepherd the Lord the blesser the Lord
[1:45:26] the maker the Lord the Mighty the Lord
[1:45:30] the Jehovah the Lord the ever-present
[1:45:42] Luke 2 and verse 8.
[1:45:44] I won't get all of this preached this
[1:45:46] week but I I'll speak some next Saturday
[1:45:48] evening by the way we have one service
[1:45:51] next week it's next Saturday evening
[1:45:53] and they were in the same country as
[1:45:55] Shepherds
[1:45:57] abiding in the field
[1:45:59] watching over their flock
[1:46:02] by night
[1:46:04] and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon
[1:46:06] them in the glory of the Lord Shone
[1:46:08] round about them and
[1:46:10] they were so afraid
[1:46:13] and the angel said unto them fear not
[1:46:17] for behold I bring you good tidings of
[1:46:20] great joy
[1:46:22] which shall be to all people
[1:46:25] for under you is Born This Day in the
[1:46:28] city of David a savior which is Christ
[1:46:31] the lord
[1:46:32] and there shall be a sign unto you you
[1:46:35] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:46:38] clothes lying in a Manger
[1:46:44] notice the Angels did not go get Kings
[1:46:49] and I have said it twice now he did not
[1:46:53] go get the dignitaries of society
[1:46:57] they went and got Shepherds that would
[1:47:00] be comfortable in a Manger
[1:47:04] but brother Ron's kings came but you
[1:47:06] haven't read the story kings came two
[1:47:09] years later
[1:47:11] they saw the star and they began to make
[1:47:14] a journey took two years brother Branham
[1:47:17] said they've been wrong in their
[1:47:18] doctrines all these years he said if it
[1:47:21] took those kings two years to get them
[1:47:25] and they brought they brought presence
[1:47:30] God anointed them to bring presents that
[1:47:33] would take care of the family
[1:47:39] gold frankincense and myrrh God arranged
[1:47:43] let me just say God is our provider
[1:47:46] and don't you never doubt God God is
[1:47:50] greater
[1:47:52] he's greater than your gift he's greater
[1:47:55] than your knowledge he's greater than
[1:47:57] your intelligence it's not you taking
[1:48:00] care of yourself no more it's God taking
[1:48:04] care of you
[1:48:05] he promised I'll be your provider I'll
[1:48:09] be your help I'll be your doctor I'll be
[1:48:12] your lawyer I'll be your provider I will
[1:48:16] take care of the wholesome total you may
[1:48:18] ring your hands and you may worry in
[1:48:20] your mind but God is God let him be God
[1:48:25] [Applause]
[1:48:27] get out of his way and just let him be
[1:48:29] God
[1:48:41] laughs
[1:48:43] foreign
[1:49:02] I'll be all right
[1:49:07] Satan knows it's the truth and he likes
[1:49:09] to fight the vessel
[1:49:12] and it came to pass
[1:49:15] as the Angels were gone away
[1:49:18] from them into heaven
[1:49:21] the shepherd said one to another
[1:49:25] let us now go
[1:49:27] even to Bethlehem
[1:49:31] of all the cities
[1:49:34] Bethlehem
[1:49:37] Bethlehem was the place that was founded
[1:49:39] by Ruth
[1:49:42] and Boaz
[1:49:45] what a story
[1:49:48] it was the bread place
[1:49:51] of the world
[1:49:55] the bread of life was going to be born
[1:49:57] there
[1:50:03] and God has to show
[1:50:06] literally forced Joseph
[1:50:09] to go there
[1:50:12] you talking about sometimes he has to
[1:50:14] force you
[1:50:16] into his will
[1:50:19] and it's not necessarily that he
[1:50:22] that you open the door but he opens the
[1:50:24] door and then he closes the one behind
[1:50:27] you
[1:50:28] and he gets behind you and he just kind
[1:50:29] of said push you
[1:50:32] and you go how did I get here
[1:50:37] brother Branham said that Joseph All the
[1:50:39] Way to Bethlehem
[1:50:41] first
[1:50:42] at a king
[1:50:44] he called him a brutal King
[1:50:46] that would cause him to have to go pay
[1:50:48] taxes
[1:50:51] sound familiar
[1:50:53] do you know that America had a tea party
[1:50:56] over 0.5 percent taxes
[1:51:03] and most of you pay anywhere from 30 to
[1:51:07] 51 percent taxes
[1:51:11] you talking about a tea party
[1:51:14] we ought to have one
[1:51:17] [Applause]
[1:51:28] I'm not going there
[1:51:34] once Angels come and sing to them they
[1:51:38] go more what wasn't that really nice
[1:51:40] wasn't that nice Angels Came saying to
[1:51:42] us
[1:51:43] but then they had a conversation we
[1:51:46] gotta go
[1:51:47] now when you got to go you gotta leave
[1:51:50] someplace
[1:51:53] and then leaving someplace you leave
[1:51:55] people behind
[1:51:57] they left their families and began to
[1:51:59] make a journey
[1:52:01] they didn't have a really good
[1:52:03] explanation because they were the one
[1:52:05] that met the angel
[1:52:07] maybe they were going along and stopped
[1:52:09] at a little Watering Hole
[1:52:12] and maybe they were just kind of talking
[1:52:14] with others and they said where are you
[1:52:16] guys going well we're going to Bethlehem
[1:52:17] what are you doing the gun Bethlehem
[1:52:19] you're not from Bethlehem well we're
[1:52:21] going there because
[1:52:23] Angels Came and sang to us
[1:52:28] really
[1:52:29] come here Bob did you hear this Angels
[1:52:33] Came and sang to these guys
[1:52:37] and they're telling us a virgin's going
[1:52:39] to conceive
[1:52:42] and they're going to find the baby not
[1:52:44] in the Cathedral of but in a in a barn
[1:52:49] nuts they're an occult
[1:52:59] the Angels saying to them
[1:53:01] God spoke to you he bypassed a lot of
[1:53:04] people
[1:53:05] [Music]
[1:53:06] he bypassed a lot of people and when you
[1:53:09] tell them they go that guy's a nut
[1:53:11] that guy's in a cart but they begin to
[1:53:14] make a journey
[1:53:16] and they didn't go to the biggest church
[1:53:18] and they didn't go to the biggest
[1:53:19] hospital they went to a barn because
[1:53:22] that's what the angel said
[1:53:24] and they found a virgin girl
[1:53:28] with a baby
[1:53:33] and Joseph was there to protect her and
[1:53:36] the baby was not wrapped in a in a
[1:53:39] blanket
[1:53:40] it was wrapped in swaddling clothes
[1:53:44] which is what the animals would be
[1:53:47] wrapped with when they worked
[1:53:51] and for us both phobia people that are
[1:53:54] phobia of germs God wrapped himself
[1:53:58] in a great wrapped gift he wrapped
[1:54:02] himself in the dirtiest clothes in the
[1:54:05] dirtiest blankets because he was going
[1:54:08] all the way back to Adam
[1:54:11] and he was paying for the sins in the
[1:54:14] garden and he was paying for every
[1:54:16] adultery and he was praying for every
[1:54:18] double marriage and he was paying for
[1:54:20] every murder he was paying for
[1:54:22] everything
[1:54:32] foreign
[1:54:33] [Applause]
[1:54:37] you can't find forgiveness for
[1:54:40] but our God can't
[1:54:47] Satan said I'll destroy the seed
[1:54:51] I'll destroy the seed
[1:54:54] the Kings heard
[1:54:57] about this King being born
[1:55:00] rumor or not
[1:55:02] they begin to kill every boy baby
[1:55:09] I can't hold it till next week Andrew
[1:55:17] s and millions of babies
[1:55:20] trying to kill the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:55:23] he's trying to do it in a womb before it
[1:55:26] ever gets here but God bypasses the
[1:55:28] wombs of your mom and daddy he takes
[1:55:31] care of you he watches over your seed
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:37] Hallelujah
[1:55:48] Paige I thought about how wonderful it
[1:55:50] is
[1:55:51] that you've been fighting for that
[1:55:53] little girl
[1:55:54] you've been fighting for her
[1:55:56] you've been fighting through court
[1:55:58] systems to get her
[1:56:01] and it's what has looked like impossible
[1:56:05] you've been fighting God put that in
[1:56:07] your heart to fight for that little girl
[1:56:09] go ahead and stand up right there
[1:56:11] got your lawyer he's your judge
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:26] Satan swore he take him away he swore
[1:56:29] he'd take your life he swore he would
[1:56:31] bury you in sin but God rich in Mercy
[1:56:34] I'm talking about a God that's rich in
[1:56:37] Mercy brother Jim
[1:56:41] when you can't forgive yourself for your
[1:56:45] past you got a god
[1:56:55] Jesus would be born and called
[1:56:57] illegitimate all of his life he would be
[1:57:00] called be elzy Bob he would be called a
[1:57:02] lot of things
[1:57:04] nobody in her day called her the mother
[1:57:07] of God
[1:57:11] nobody in her day called her the mother
[1:57:15] of God
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:19] but even meeting an angel she made
[1:57:22] mistakes
[1:57:26] she had Angel visitations
[1:57:34] and that didn't give her a new birth
[1:57:40] she testified that this baby that was
[1:57:43] born in her
[1:57:45] was God
[1:57:47] that didn't give her a new birth
[1:57:50] she diapered the baby she watched him
[1:57:53] fall and she held him
[1:57:55] she watched him scratch his hands and
[1:57:57] play in the mud and she held him she
[1:58:00] watched how he would operate differently
[1:58:01] than any other babies and she pondered
[1:58:04] the things in her heart she saw Kings
[1:58:07] come it didn't change her
[1:58:09] [Applause]
[1:58:13] at 12 years old
[1:58:15] they go as the custom wise to worship
[1:58:19] and somehow she goes off without Jesus
[1:58:23] brother on Mary didn't make any mistakes
[1:58:25] you're probably not going to like this
[1:58:27] part
[1:58:28] if you're Catholic you're not going to
[1:58:30] like this part Mary and Joseph went off
[1:58:33] without Jesus and brother bran said
[1:58:35] that's what happens in the church
[1:58:38] Jesus was in their church but they go
[1:58:41] off without Jesus
[1:58:45] Ichabod written over the door but they
[1:58:47] went off without Jesus they built Mighty
[1:58:49] big buildings and they got all kind of
[1:58:51] programs but Jesus is not there
[1:58:59] foreign
[1:59:02] they're gone for a few days
[1:59:04] I don't know how you can go listen I
[1:59:06] don't want to live without Jesus
[1:59:14] I'll share something with you
[1:59:16] last night I had a visitation
[1:59:19] I shared this with Gabe this morning
[1:59:22] you're going to like this
[1:59:27] and I saw myself
[1:59:29] at a clothing store
[1:59:33] and it was all suit jackets
[1:59:37] sister Connie will tell you if I like
[1:59:39] one I buy two if I like two I'll buy
[1:59:41] three
[1:59:46] and I go to this clothing store
[1:59:50] and I get 1100
[1:59:52] Plus
[1:59:58] and the salesman says
[2:00:01] these all
[2:00:03] are the coats
[2:00:05] representing sermons that was preached
[2:00:08] by Elijah
[2:00:13] and the angel was standing and said try
[2:00:16] this on
[2:00:19] and I tried on deity of Jesus Christ
[2:00:24] and I said
[2:00:25] isn't it amazing
[2:00:27] it fits
[2:00:29] most of my coats have to be cut off
[2:00:32] both in
[2:00:33] sister Betty is one of my seamstress but
[2:00:36] most of them have to be cut off because
[2:00:37] they hang over my my arm and so they cut
[2:00:41] them off and
[2:00:43] and they hang too long and I look like
[2:00:46] I'm wearing my Granddaddy's coat
[2:00:48] and so they cut them off and I'm telling
[2:00:51] you this to tell you this
[2:00:53] I tried on 1100 coats
[2:00:56] Plus
[2:00:58] and he said where are you going to put
[2:00:59] them
[2:01:00] and I said I've got a place I'm going to
[2:01:01] hang them I'm going to hang them in the
[2:01:03] upper room of my house
[2:01:09] Hallelujah
[2:01:15] the prophet preached in them I want to
[2:01:17] wear
[2:01:22] that's what you'll hear in this church
[2:01:25] the coat fits and it fits perfectly
[2:01:29] and he told me last night it fits
[2:01:31] perfectly
[2:01:33] hang them in your house
[2:01:36] take one out and wear it
[2:01:38] I'm not done preaching folks I'm going
[2:01:41] to be here for a while if I got 1100
[2:01:43] coach to wear I'm going to be here for a
[2:01:46] while
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:02:00] I'm not ashamed of this message
[2:02:03] I'm at the angel
[2:02:06] I'm at the angel
[2:02:11] came into my heart and he lives he lives
[2:02:13] he lives
[2:02:23] foreign
[2:02:27] it was good this morning too wasn't it
[2:02:31] Gabriel comes every Sunday morning I'm
[2:02:34] sorry Sarah
[2:02:35] he comes every Sunday morning to our
[2:02:37] place it's home
[2:02:39] and he comes and eats with me breakfast
[2:02:41] and
[2:02:45] if you want to make a an appointment
[2:02:48] see Connie
[2:03:07] sorry
[2:03:08] that was more emotional that time than
[2:03:10] it was in the vision
[2:03:20] Jesus
[2:03:24] your father and I
[2:03:27] have been looking for you
[2:03:30] we've been looking
[2:03:32] and all of those preachers
[2:03:34] hurt her to deny the supernatural birth
[2:03:42] and Jesus has just confounded all those
[2:03:44] doctors and kings and scientists
[2:03:47] and told them about
[2:03:49] how that God created the body because he
[2:03:52] was there and he did it
[2:03:55] how did he created the Earth
[2:03:58] he just wasn't speaking off the cuff
[2:03:59] because he was there and he did it
[2:04:04] how the constellations of the heavens
[2:04:07] were laid out
[2:04:10] it was more than just off of the cuff
[2:04:12] because he was there and he did it
[2:04:17] Jesus talking about the one with the
[2:04:19] woman at the well look at that picture
[2:04:22] when he was talking at the woman at the
[2:04:24] well
[2:04:25] and he was talking to her
[2:04:29] before Jacob's Well I knew Jacob
[2:04:35] I knew Jacob
[2:04:37] I knew him well
[2:04:42] as a matter of fact he knew Abraham
[2:04:45] he knew Noah
[2:04:47] he knew David
[2:04:49] he knew Solomon and now he knows a woman
[2:04:52] at the well
[2:04:54] and if she could recognize the gift
[2:04:57] I didn't get an Overcoat but I got a
[2:05:00] picture
[2:05:01] brother Branham talks about this woman
[2:05:03] every service
[2:05:09] when I got this last night as a present
[2:05:13] it's going to be hung in this office
[2:05:15] back here because that same Jesus is in
[2:05:18] the building today
[2:05:21] maybe you're the woman at the well maybe
[2:05:23] you're the person that has come
[2:05:26] and he called you by name
[2:05:38] but you can't hide it from him
[2:05:47] and Jesus turns to her and quickly
[2:05:51] brother Branham uses his term
[2:05:54] the word always corrects the error
[2:05:59] and the word corrected Mary
[2:06:05] and brother Banner said if you will
[2:06:07] notice he never called her mother
[2:06:12] I preached that one time here and there
[2:06:14] was a couple that was visiting and they
[2:06:16] quickly went through their Bible
[2:06:18] he does never call her mother
[2:06:22] [Applause]
[2:06:25] he calls her woman
[2:06:31] even on the cross
[2:06:33] they asked him about his mother he said
[2:06:35] who is my mother
[2:06:38] and Mary was right there
[2:06:42] are you with me John Behold thy mother
[2:06:47] he was giving him instructions from the
[2:06:49] cross take care of her
[2:06:52] Joseph is no longer here to take care of
[2:06:54] her you take care of her
[2:06:56] come on Church
[2:06:58] come on church she wasn't God
[2:07:01] neither was she the mother of God I'm
[2:07:04] coming to a point here
[2:07:07] Mary had met an angel Mary had been
[2:07:10] corrected by the word Mary watch them
[2:07:13] beat him
[2:07:15] do you know how much tall that she
[2:07:17] fought as Humanity
[2:07:20] watching all of these events
[2:07:23] I dare say we must respect her
[2:07:26] we must always reverence her
[2:07:29] but she wasn't God
[2:07:33] I dare say we must respect brother
[2:07:36] Branham
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:37] [Applause]
[2:07:38] we must honor him but he wasn't God
[2:07:42] [Applause]
[2:07:50] Jesus Is Our God
[2:07:53] brother Branham said if he wasn't God he
[2:07:56] was the greatest deceiver that the world
[2:07:58] ever had
[2:08:02] Hallelujah let's applaud that right
[2:08:04] there
[2:08:09] [Applause]
[2:08:24] she had stood in some very special
[2:08:26] places
[2:08:31] I would dare say that
[2:08:33] Sister Jenny I would dare say
[2:08:37] that one of the most difficult times
[2:08:40] the most difficult jobs
[2:08:43] the woman
[2:08:44] who changed his diaper
[2:08:47] that held him
[2:08:49] and looked at him as the word itself
[2:08:52] and she loved him
[2:08:54] all right
[2:08:58] today
[2:08:59] she has to help take him off the cross
[2:09:03] in those same hands
[2:09:05] now have huge holes
[2:09:08] and the brow that she's held at her
[2:09:12] heart
[2:09:14] she remembers when he was a baby
[2:09:17] foreign
[2:09:25] there was no lights
[2:09:27] there was no flashes of thunder
[2:09:32] that was ridicule outside the barn
[2:09:36] to have babies in the illegitimate child
[2:09:38] born in my barn
[2:09:45] and she held him
[2:09:49] today
[2:09:52] there's thorns on his head
[2:09:57] no doubt she tried to pull him out
[2:10:00] because they hurt so bad
[2:10:04] blood running from his side
[2:10:06] she holds him
[2:10:09] this is one of the most difficult days
[2:10:10] she's ever lived through
[2:10:20] Christmas should be worshiped
[2:10:25] but you've got to see the whole picture
[2:10:29] he didn't come just to be bored
[2:10:34] he come to be born in you
[2:10:37] and to be born in you he has to die like
[2:10:40] this
[2:10:41] he has to pay for your sins Reuben
[2:10:46] your grandfather introduced the message
[2:10:49] here at this audience
[2:10:51] and
[2:10:52] and here you are a grandchild even a
[2:10:56] great grandchild of that experience but
[2:10:59] you had to be born
[2:11:01] again
[2:11:04] you had to know this message for
[2:11:06] yourself
[2:11:07] not enough for you to raise your
[2:11:09] children in this church
[2:11:13] but they got to meet the same Christ
[2:11:16] for themselves
[2:11:27] you know he's preached I have power to
[2:11:29] lay my life down
[2:11:31] power to take it up again
[2:11:35] destroy this Temple and in three days
[2:11:38] I'll raise it up
[2:11:41] and it's been so powerful
[2:11:44] until King's order
[2:11:47] guards
[2:11:49] and pay them off
[2:11:52] to seal the tomb
[2:11:55] were these girls
[2:11:57] and men have taken him
[2:12:00] it wasn't enough to stand at every
[2:12:02] service and make fun of him
[2:12:04] but now after the crucifixion
[2:12:08] they guard his grave
[2:12:13] Satan will never leave you alone
[2:12:17] but I can tell you this if we go by the
[2:12:20] way of the Grave Satan can put guards at
[2:12:22] every one of our tombs on Resurrection
[2:12:25] morning we're going to come out of there
[2:12:27] [Applause]
[2:12:34] you're talking about a Christmas gift
[2:12:37] whether by cancer or whether by
[2:12:40] tuberculosis whether by old age or
[2:12:43] whether by an infant on that
[2:12:45] Resurrection Day God's going to unwrap
[2:12:48] that graveyard and you're going to step
[2:12:51] out of that grave
[2:12:54] [Music]
[2:12:56] I have power to lay my life down which
[2:12:59] meant you
[2:13:01] because you're in me I got power to lay
[2:13:04] you down and I got power to raise you
[2:13:07] back up again
[2:13:08] [Applause]
[2:13:11] foreign
[2:13:15] you're going to get a lot of gifts this
[2:13:17] week
[2:13:18] but none will be as powerful as that
[2:13:28] on the first day nothing moved
[2:13:31] that you could see
[2:13:38] but Jesus walked through hell
[2:13:41] foreign
[2:13:42] and he said my blood is not even dry on
[2:13:46] the cross
[2:13:48] but I've come down here to take over
[2:13:52] this wasn't what you could see those
[2:13:54] guards didn't see nothing going on but
[2:13:56] in hell
[2:13:58] he was unwrapping a Christmas gift
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:02] in hell he had some keys that he needed
[2:14:05] to get a hold of
[2:14:07] in a place called Abraham's bosom where
[2:14:09] some people that was trapped
[2:14:14] that met him with Abraham and Sarah they
[2:14:18] had met him West Ezekiel is the will of
[2:14:21] the middle of the wheel they had met him
[2:14:25] that's a temple that could be built
[2:14:29] God walked through hell
[2:14:31] and he knocked on Satan's door
[2:14:38] Satan said I thought I had you
[2:14:43] I thought I had you
[2:14:48] and he started when the prophets I
[2:14:50] thought I had you then and I thought I
[2:14:52] had you now and I thought I had you down
[2:14:54] but I got you on the cross
[2:14:58] and Jesus said shaken
[2:15:01] I've came down here to take all the
[2:15:03] [Applause]
[2:15:05] and when you're more powerful than every
[2:15:07] demon in hell you can take a halt and
[2:15:10] you could take a hold and you could take
[2:15:12] the keys of death Helen the grave
[2:15:15] he could not have did it if he wasn't
[2:15:17] more powerful than cancer he could have
[2:15:20] not did it if he wasn't more powerful
[2:15:21] than the grave but being he was more
[2:15:25] powerful because he was the word
[2:15:28] Eternal Emmanuel the provider
[2:15:39] give way
[2:15:43] [Applause]
[2:15:45] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[2:15:47] unto men
[2:15:51] you see
[2:15:53] Mary
[2:15:55] was about to have
[2:15:58] her next birth
[2:16:01] [Laughter]
[2:16:03] I'm not going to finish
[2:16:05] but Mary was about to get ready to get
[2:16:07] her next birth
[2:16:10] cause in the visitation of the Angel it
[2:16:13] didn't give her salvation
[2:16:15] her normal birth didn't give her
[2:16:17] salvation
[2:16:19] born of a certain lineage didn't give
[2:16:20] her salvation meeting an angel didn't
[2:16:23] give her salvation
[2:16:25] brother Branham said she climbed that
[2:16:27] ladder like the rest of the sisters
[2:16:30] she climbed up there with all those
[2:16:32] other people and hid away with 120
[2:16:35] people
[2:16:37] and brother random said it if Mary
[2:16:40] and he even goes this far says Mary the
[2:16:43] Mother of God had to have the Holy Ghost
[2:16:47] so will you
[2:16:49] he said nothing will substitute it
[2:16:52] you've got to have the Holy Ghost in
[2:16:54] your life
[2:16:56] more than shaking a preacher's hand more
[2:16:59] than churchanity you've got to have the
[2:17:02] new birth
[2:17:03] I know people are so ashamed of speaking
[2:17:06] in tongues and Gifts in a church
[2:17:10] but Mary spoke in tongues
[2:17:13] she danced in the spirit
[2:17:15] [Applause]
[2:17:17] we got too many Church of Christ and
[2:17:19] Baptists
[2:17:21] that are dead we got too many dead
[2:17:23] churches too many dead preachers that
[2:17:27] are ashamed I want to explain away the
[2:17:30] Holy Ghost but I say unto you if Mary
[2:17:33] had to have it
[2:17:38] you're gonna have to have it
[2:17:43] why do I have to have a brother on it's
[2:17:45] a token sign to you
[2:17:48] we're going to be more than a church
[2:17:52] we're going to be a resurrection

[2:59:16] you're such an amazing group of people
[2:59:18] we have so many Ministries and we're
[2:59:21] blessed to have some of the greatest
[2:59:22] Ministries around the world to be able
[2:59:23] to come here I'll just say this they
[2:59:26] love preaching to you
[2:59:28] it's an atmosphere here it's because
[2:59:30] these are things that we prayed about
[2:59:33] what you're seeing Happening Here a
[2:59:35] breakthrough and a break free every
[2:59:36] single service is because there have
[2:59:39] been prayers that have went up
[2:59:41] all of these generals and all of these
[2:59:42] brothers and sisters I've been here for
[2:59:44] years prayed for these young people that
[2:59:47] where they are right now that God would
[2:59:48] fill them with the Holy Ghost when they
[2:59:50] were little bitty children and to watch
[2:59:52] the effect of the Holy Ghost upon their
[2:59:54] life this is the effect of prayer if you
[2:59:57] want to have this in your home pray
[2:59:59] if you want to have this in your church
[3:00:01] pray
[3:00:03] God has been extra good to us this
[3:00:06] Christmas year and every season of Life
[3:00:09] he's been good to us he's never failed
[3:00:11] us and he never will but we're going to
[3:00:13] dismiss you today and let you go out and
[3:00:15] I'm going to ask you that you go out
