a few times but it's one that just kind of sits in your heart believing when believing isn't easy that's the testing [Music] amen amen it's not hard to believe standing on the Mountaintop of Glory when you can hear the songs of angels and a breeze from Heaven send your spirit so real but in the valley once more would Jesus still be Lord that's the [Music] question cuz believing when beling isn't easy that is the testing oh and I need faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the Mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone I must cling and I need strength for the day when trouble comes my way and I just don't understand what it means and that's when nothing else will do faith alone will see you through and believe in becomes my victory and it's not hard to believe when things are going well and skies are sunny when you feel you're making progress and doing good living in a time of plenty oh but if all of that should change will you still keep the faith that's the question oh cuz believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing amen can you sing that this morning well and I KNE faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone I must gling and I need strength for the day when troubles come my way and I just don't understand what it means and that's when nothing else will do faith alone will see me through and believeing becomes my victory let's sing that together one more time will and I need faith for the time when the sun does not shine and the mountain Mountain Top is just a memory and there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone I must C and I need strength for the day when trouble come my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will see me through and believe in becomes my [Music] victory amen God bless you if the whole Ray family would come at this time for okay life is full of trbl we have our share of pain some days it's just a strugg go to stay above the waves but God is near the broken so lift your weary head he is so much stronger then what you're up against some see a mountain Faith sees a mountain moved some see the waters faith can see us walking through so in this moment just keep on trusting and [Applause] believe there are some things only faith can see Holy Faith can [Music] see fears never make it and doubt can grip your heart when dreams you

to suffer rejection and pay for crimes he had not done for what Earthly reason would the father let him hang on a tree I wept with the answer that one Earthly reason was me I was the reason that one Earthly [Music] reason and I was the [Music] guilty but he was a sacrifice I was the T Aker but he was the [Music] G dying while I go free that one Earthly reason was me the fairest of Angels were not summoned from the throne up in the sky to purchase my pardon not even the angels could die the only provision for my freedom was destined to be the sweet Lamb Of Glory and his only reason was me I was the reason that one Earthly [Music] reason I was the guilty and he was the sacrifice I was the T [Applause] maker and he was the G dying while I go free that one Earthly reason was me that was one Earthly reason his only reason was [Music] [Applause] me Feels Like Heaven has come down this morning I don't know know how you feel this morning I just feel like The Nearness of the holy spirit is so

Lord of lords to come by our way our heart's desire is to see more of him to have more of him to feel him to have victory in our souls and to come catch our waiting Souls away and I believe that it's

the Lord it surely is it's nice to be able to be with friends see I'm I'm the problem of the family is I'm emotional if you haven't seen it you see it now and uh brother Ron thank you for being part of our Lives brother Andrew I I don't know where to start and where to go Lord we know you you don't know me I got to greet the church back home because half the church are on the video watching your services every Sunday and they get the church and they say you know what brother Ron preached or brother Andrew preached or whatever and I go don't tell me cuz they'll think that I copied their notes uh so often the Holy Spirit has a great mind and the mind goes out not just to an assembly here in Virginia but all the way up to Canada and around the world and that gives us a great joy to know that that it's not just a a man's thought but it's the Holy Spirit and uh so greetings to GL Bible way and they want me of course to bring their greetings and love to you and especially brother bcll sister bisc amen amen well I I brought my family or they brought themselves I don't know what happened I said uh brother Ron has been gracious to invite us to come up brother Michael and myself to come up and uh it just was like I'm in I'm in I'm in I'm in amen and we're all inall amen that's how much the Spencer Family Sister Connie amen has meant to us and you have meant to us not one was left behind and even Hannah is expecting so she even brought the potential sister Whitney God bless you brother Davey amen I've known them since a little girl and look at her now she a mommy my goodness I'm getting old yeah if am I okay okay okay we got all day right we do I I know that scares some people even when I bring up a whole pile of books and things like that he say you still use books well I bring this up to pretend half the time I'm just about there I might even try it today it's telling me my Apple pencil's low I don't know what that means but this has been one of the greatest weeks amen there was a man of God called Edward bcll that preached a message one day and a young man was sitting in an audience and God saved amen and that's your pastor the tie goes a long ways doesn't it brother Ry TI goes a long long way and by the grace of God when I first met brother Ron I said how come the Lord had held you back from me all my life amen but I think we tried to catch up do some catch up over the years we've been able I've been the blessed man to be able to travel with brother Ron Spencer and blessed by his ministry and his life and his love and his friendship we've been overseas together and we shared meetings together and they've impacted my life and they still impact my life I just I mean there is so much in our family and I'm you you see my son Sam and uh you can go right along down to Michael go Sam Michael and and our baby is is Joel and um one year we were blessed to have the whole Spencer family up to our way so we sort of felt we needed to reciprocate so when I told brother Ron and sister Connie that we were going to come up they said how many I said all of them Payback pay back and so we were blessed to have them and you know after after um I just want to bring this one up because uh I love brother Andrew amen um he's a part of my life if I get to heaven I get a little bit of a reward amen and you know we don't look for rewards but brother BR said you don't preach on rewards enough but there is rewards you know and I had the privilege of being with Andrew we are out after camp and um I'll slow down brother Ron is okay just want to brother Ron had a terrible accident as you I'm telling you you and um brother Matthew you're a hero to me hero saved him and brother bcll we had bought in a we call it a Bible Camp our family camp we have a little bit of a 40 some odat acre Wilderness Camp up at Mount Baker and and uh we just purchased it brother Ron was going through a a terrible time and brother bcll um he phoned you right sister Connie and he said to Sister Connie and brother Ron was at a state I think probably the lowest part and they were thinking of harvesting is that right I don't want to say anything out a turn and that's where the headp space was where they were going and brother bcll says to Sister Connie he says you whisper her you talk he said the last thing that goes is the hearing you tell brother Ron he's going to take our first family bible camp when it looked impossible that's when the Holy Spirit started to move and brother Ron Spencer was our first bible speaker God bless you brother Ron but that had to be it had to be brother Ron Brother roll had known of course Joel is that all right can I Joel wasn't in what we call the a good spot and uh we are so burdened for him and um we we'd ask him would you just come to service just would you come to service brother Ron Spencer is going to come and preach at our service and brother Ron preached a masterpiece it was their first service it should have been the last service but it was the first service and the whole church like this just moved up to the altar I'm sitting probably where Michael is sitting and and uh Jo and the organ would have been closer over here and and the whole move of God was gone and I thought I looked for Joel and his chair was empty and I go you can't have gone you can't have gone Lord you can't have left the service so it was a long after service people praying and I'm praying with a whole pile of people over here and other brothers are praying for over here he just can't see over here and I finally get to sit down and look at Joan where's Joel where's Joel she said he's right here he was one of the first that came up to the front so God works a mysterious ways God tried to take your pastor off the scene and Satan knew that he could get him he'd get my son and God had to raise brother Ron up for my son and so Joel gave his heart to the Lord and and we had a mini camp go to Victoria I think all the suspencers and the frasers and whoever we were all over at this Victorious Vancouver Island it's a huge Island they think an you think an island well it's 475 Miles by what 80 miles 100 miles I don't know it's big place and so we're all over there and we're all walking down the street look like a little crowd just moving like a bees just everybody talking and fellowshipping and uh you know it's wonderful to see when Believers love each other and they're talking about word brother Andrew and I saw us linger behind we lingered a little bit behind and he's got his arm around me of course everybody's taller than me anyway and he's walking with me and he says Hey Brother Tom he said I heard you were a great golfer and I go no I wasn't a great golfer in my in my second life the other life well not this life my other life before I got saved our family was sort of that type of people and um he said no I heard you're a very great golfer I said no no Andrew no I said I was a good golfer I I I I I enjoyed it I I liked it a lot you know our Pro was a very good friend of ours and was thinking maybe my brother and myself would do more than what we did and uh I said but I I'm only a good golfer I said a great golfer and we're just talking like this and we're walking on the street just coming on over the curb now going through a sidewalk to the other side I said I'm not a good wasn't a great golfer I was only good a great golfer has a heart for it that's what greatness you got a gift of it and you got to have a heart for it amen I said I might have a little bit of a gift to play it I said but my heart as a little boy even though my parents were unbelievers did not even go to church as a 5-year-old boy four-year-old boy I told my parents when I grow up I'm going to be a preacher so as soon as I said to brother Andrew I said my heart was always for the Lord and the Holy Spirit brother Andrew isn't it TR is it true he fell right there in the middle of a road he said brother Tom he said I have not told anybody this so he told me some personal things and he saysi not saved I said you can be right here right now in this very spot and every time I go over there brother Andrew I look at that spot I think that's where Andrew Spencer got saved by the glory of God and to that I give him all the praise God bless you brother so the Lord by God's grace use brother Ron for my son Joel sitting here with his lovely wife Kim and by some way I had the privilege to be with you brother Andrew and your dear wife Katie and to think now in my little fly LEF my Bible brother bcll at a camp meeting way back when got up after the preacher and I've used it many times and and I you know I've had men come up to me and say you know really you actually believe that I said yeah I actually believe that because they're sitting here they're sitting here with their wives and all their children brother bisc got up after a camp meeting and I'm a deacon at the time sitting at the back and I'm standing against one of the tent poles and he turns around to the group of people and God had come in a very unusual way and he says I give you your children and I sat there and I just raised my little hand I said I got three boys and I claim them by the prophecy of that word and what you're seeing today is a prophecy fulfilled in your ears hallelujah hallelujah to God be the glory amen what he's done for one he'll do for you and if it's any encouragement to you whatsoever if he's done it once he'll do it again I don't care how far your children are or wherever they are we're going to take the word of the Lord this morning we're going to run the devil right out of this place any unbelieving Spirit we deny it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I have so many thank yous and and I mean we are we are blown over my little grandchildren come up to me and say grandpa they even gave us little presents I said we'll come again I said man touch my grandchildren you touch me my children are all growing up now but I love them well we have that every Sunday we go home and we have a meal our table is getting so long and I think it's getting longer I don't know I won't prophesy anything but thank you for opening your hearts Michael Masterpiece it was a masterpiece brother Ron came I know I I don't know what you hear what what's been told you I'm sure it's everything and I'm not adding anything or taking away but brother Ron flew in one time for our camp seven years ago coming up seven years he said brother Tom I got two things on my heart and one is your son and he says ' I don't want you to say anything I said my lips are sealed and when brother Ron called for a pray meeting or prayer line it was a prayer meeting already right prayer line he turned to me I don't know where I know you see more than me because I'm just one of those one born under de season I guess in your life and uh brother Ron turned and looked at me and I go whoa okay his eyes were different and I'm standing right there and he says call Michael I go call Michael call Michael call Michael we called Michael and Michael came up and brother Ron said to him um I you're called to the ministry or whatever was said and and brother Ron was rehearsing to me yesterday he said the first words out of Michael's lips was no oh he grew up in a preacher's home and then of course he said well if the Lord called me he's going to call my wife and that bigel God bless you dear he called you both Amen to a great calling great calling after I watched him last night I understand something more real I'm not I'm not Leonardo D viny don't get it on he had a longer beard and Michael's not Michelangelo but pretty close but there's a story that goes when um the Vatican and everything was to be built there was only two artists that uh they wanted to choose between the old old Leonardo or the young Michelangelo I figured they chose the right they took Michelangelo and the reason why I think now I understand Leonardo took 16 years to paint the Mona Lisa and if he was going to paint the 16th chapel he'd still be painting so they wanted youth and quickness and I'm just so proud to see what God has done to vindicate what God put on your pastor's heart amen you again saw another Vindication of the word going forth and so you understand why we love him so much yes we do and I know you do and I know there's a whole pile more people around the world do but God bless you God bless you for holding your pastor brother Andrew up this church as Michael said last night has been a lighthouse around the world you know you think you're sometimes you feel low and you feel that you're a nobody but without you we wouldn't be preaching without you there would be no church without you we'd have no Ministry you're an integral part of the body of Christ and your lives have blessed the Saints around the world and I applaud you God bless you Pastor brother Andrew God bless his church is that is okay amen somebody say no we be all right you wonder my feeling but I just thought you know um we now what we've just and of course there's just more and the and and God is mysterious in his ways and his wonders to perform and and God has has brought can you imagine to you know Canada in the far left corner all the way to Virginia Jenny it's just amazing and I I I look at it as nothing but God and how God put it all together is the greatness of God and so without any further delay I'm sorry it's 10 after 12 I'll try and be as concise as possible I know we'll be out by 3 that's my conciseness amen no it will be sooner than that don't you worry don't you worry let's stand please to our feet I've got a little uh thought of course as you pray and study things open as all the ministers know that and and it just keeps all all unfolding but you have to try and keep focus focus and I'm just believing today that God has something special for someone amen and sister Nancy I didn't see you hiding back there God bless you Sister Nancy you mean a lot to us your picture is on our family chat it's already gone back North sister Ru says hello amen no and the word the word is specific it's direct it's it's personal and I'm going to um look at a little little spot here in the scripture and and I'm just maybe do a little bit of a turn but just stay with me I'm Leonardo da Vinci I'm the old guy not that I'm Leonardo I'm just the old guy so let's turn please into the word of God to Luke chapter 5 I haven't spoken on this so help me preach as brother Tim puit says I like that help me preach I love brother Tim amen you know what it's amazing how God puts friends in your life and they're so far apart far but you know sometimes you just get on the telephone you talk to one another maybe not in 3 months or whatever and it's just like you just caught right up it's instant and just think what heaven's going to be like when we all catch up Thomas all together and be be one amen Luke did I say Luke 5 verse 17 please and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by I want you to notice that it says specifically they were just sitting by so that's we'll just take our time and it came to pass on a certain day he was teaching that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of Galilee Judah Judea Jerusalem the power of the Lord was present to heal them and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with the py and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went up upon the Housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch in the midst before Jesus and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee a't that amazing and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason why they were just sitting by they weren't participants here they were just sitting by and we don't come to church to sit by all right so we didn't come to this little service this morning and say well we haven't seen brother Tom and we heard about him he's short and white haired and old and whatever and I'm just going to sit and see what he's got to say we don't sit by we have a chore to do that is the Beat the Devil down come on and live a life worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen we don't come to play Church we're not sitting by yes so who do you identify with the sitter biters or the tile [Applause] Wreckers and I just thought I might title it tile Wreckers amen we need to break some tiles around here let's get into the presence of the Lord where Miracles are happening the Supernatural is [Applause] moving amen we are not passes we're not pansies we are Sons and Daughters of God bought by the blood yes I know in whom I have beli and and persuaded that he's more than able to beat any situation I don't care what it is we have seen every spectrum of the Gospel fulfilled and all we just say I want more of Jesus I'm going to be a tile wrecker this morning morning I'm not going to be a sitter buyer I get all these new words all spoken and people say well where did you get that word I said well I it's a Tom Ray word so they have a dictionary started the dictionary of Tom Webster and when they saw their faith he said unto them man thy sins are forgiven thee and the scribes in the Pharisees began to reason why they're reasoning because they're sitter buyers ah you know where that type and Shadow come from or why is he tying that quote with this quote they start reasoning certain things we are saying what the prophet says we aren't adding or taking away we are saying what he says I want to title this message we are in the land of the free come on on we are in the land of the free I'm not talking about this land I'm talking about the Holy Ghost Land we've got a freedom and freedom has sounded no retreat amen and he Caleb this is your good time to be a big amener today so when you go back you're going to be my Amen Corner you call it's called opening your mouth no I'm not talking about you Caleb I I like the feedback you get quiet I'll stop I know some of these brothers brother Ron's a great preacher I've seen him in Warfare oh yeah they might not like it he's going to plow right through amen but here I feel right at home there's no plowing here I'm setting my wings and we're flying and we haven't even finished reading script scripture my hallelujah praise the Lord isn't Church wonderful come on isn't Church wonderful to me it's marvelous my life I live for this these moments I live for them what's out there you tell me what's out there there is nothing out there I walked through W Washington DC I looked at people that are just a bunch of zombies they don't know where they're going and what's going Michael gets a message out of there I get a message out of there we are in the land of the free they are bound by Satan but God has come down in this generation to loose you to lift you into Heavenly places always that's what he said Heavenly places you're in Heavenly places sometimes doesn't sound like a quote to me huh you are in Heavenly places always we are in the land of the free and we're tile Wreckers we're not sitter buyers that's right amen we're getting ready to go home aren't we you're afraid I'm going to keep you standing all service uh-huh oh you're already going look at and watch I'm going to stand for five minutes he stands all the time he stands all the time we're just enjoying ourselves okay it's all right my never have me back but that's okay we'll write off into the sunset we'll rise together amen thy sins be forgiven thee and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemy who can forgive sin but God Alone yes that's the point that's right that's the point they were missing God but the tile Wreckers never they knew God was in their midst amen we need to start breaking some tiles say well I got a friend and he's in his bed of infirmity and I need to get him to church yes Lord amen well I better read their scripture here but when Jesus perceived their thoughts he answered and said unto them what reason ye in your in your hearts whether it's easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or say rise up and walk but that they may know that the son of man has power upon the Earth to forgive sin amen I say unto thee they're challenging God what is the devil thinking he's a loser in the beginning he got fallen from heaven and he's going to hell they're challenging God and so he says was it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or rise up and walk but that you may know that the son of man have power upon the Earth to forgive sins I say unto thee arise take up thy couch and go into thine house and immediately he arose up before them took up where in he laid and departed to his own home glorifying God Amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seat sorry for keeping you standing py he was afflicted of py and it's very specific doesn't say he was inflicted with an infirmity but it gives us a specific diagnosis of the situation and when God have come in this generation and used a son of man again he was very specific right of what their infirmity was it wasn't like oh I think you have a headache or you got a back pain or you've got this little problem he was very specific you've got this problem you've got that problem you got this blood pressure problem you got this kidney problem but you have it no more Hallelujah because there were people that tore off tiles to get to a service it was not convenient to get to a service some slept in cars for days we forget those days because now we have churches and we sit in a Pew but there's people that drove for hours and days and weeks to follow the son of man in this day but now it's easy we just live in a home come to a church everything's fine everything's easy but God is still specific God is still specific py it's accompanied by a weakness and a loss of feeling right so if we just don't have to look at the the natural part let's take a look at the spiritual part it's a brain disorder and it will kill you so we're not looking at a situation of some thou 2,000 years ago that we think well that was a nice story and Jesus came through this town and the Pharisees Sadducees were there and they were just sitting by we don't want to be those kind of people we don't ever want to those kind of people we want to be tile Wreckers can you imagine what was in their mind I'm going to wreck your house Andrew not my house but Jesus knew exactly what house he it wasn't it wasn't a concrete top he knew exactly the type of house he needed to be in God knew what kind of church you need to be in he knew what position he had to be in he wasn't to the right he wasn't to the left that bed came right down to him glory I'd like to have friends like that I do Glory I do you do too you do too you sit down and say Hey Brother John needs to get to this service make a bed show up with a bed one day say what's that bed for you you're sick of mind you're insane brother said without a holy ghost you're insane so if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're insane but can I say to you today receive ye the Holy Ghost let the Holy Spirit move in the church amen raise you up under your bed of Affliction yep

something wave your hand you know I read a quote to the church the other day brother R said young man you that raised your hand that's the greatest thing you ever did in your whole entire higher life you raised your hand and God saw that hand you said I'm not going to raise my hand I'm too conservative raise both hands that's it raise him up God sees that it's a supernatural act Hallelujah I told myself I wouldn't get excited Mike did all the excitement for me you you have my greatest preachers here you do I'm just the peashooter this morning but I'll tell you what that PE sh going took that devil down uh-huh [Applause] uh-huh he has no defense the prophet said he's already defeated he has no teeth we heard about no keys as one brother said no keys to his own house he has nothing so what is your problem we have God in us amen so this py is being named py for a reason it's a brain disorder and if he kept in that condition that would cause him to die but once you come into the presence of the Resurrection you cannot die and so thankful this morning that the resurrected one is here in our midst he said the same God that walked on the Waters of Galilee has walked out his the pages of this Bible and is in this church Hallelujah he is the same yesterday today and forever so God is in our church don't be a sinner buyer be a tile Ripper my wife needs an experience my husband needs an experience my children need a Deliverance ask and you shall receive knock and it shall be open seek it and you shall find [Applause] it Hallelujah so Paul a a brain disorder it's going to kill you your muscles get you can't hardly move your muscles they're outed disorder and you're sitting in the church dying but they had four friends Hallelujah justification sanctification huh the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the word himself carried a bed into the very presence of God and he raised up out of it and they're still reasoning come on as we heard last night walked into my home hair down the here lamb chops like this you know looking just like the the world itself but bounding and my mom and dad have they had a winding staircase I come bounding up the stairs my dad looks at me and goes what happened to you Dad I once had Psy I was mental I was losing my F uhhuh but then Jesus came and when Jesus came he gave me a new [Applause] mind amen so it doesn't matter what you're Afflicted of I don't care what it is we got a God that's present and we got a church of tile Rippers and we're going to bring the present gum into the presence of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah think about it those did not have a clue who he was and another group had a clue who he was one had no Revelation the other one had Revelation if we can just get him to the king just get him to the presence of God we know he'll rais from that bed I know if I take my wife she'll come yeah I know my oh honey I don't don't want to bother you and just say hey let's tell it like it is I did my mom and dad were sitting and Sammy was just what maybe two months old and they came over to see a boy that I couldn't have a child impossible for us to have children brother sney Jackson sends us a a little a little prayer cloth that brother Brown prayed over and then 1951 52 whenever it was in South Africa he sends it to brother bcll and says daughter brother bcll your daughter problem conceiving he doesn't even know us he knows he I think he knew the girls he knows Joanne he the family but then who me doctor said you will never have a child Joanne will never have a child but God put it on a man of God's heart in South Africa he was praying in his little motel room for services brother Ron you would appreciate that and he said brother and the Holy Ghost would take him over and said brother bis's daughter problems conceiving and brother Ed calls us up gives us the letter put and we read the letter and there's the little square the brother Brown prayed over over 20 some years ago before Sam was born and he says why don't you go home and pray and put it on whoever you feel we got home Joan and I read the letter over we got down on our knees we prayed and I said honey it didn't say Tom Ray he doesn't know Tom Ray the Holy Ghost knows you and I'll tell you I hope he knows me and I said why don't we just put it on you and within that week we got a blessed son and his name is Samuel Aaron Ray to God be the glory amen so he can take a man that it's insane out of the world and bring him as a Son of God and bless him you say well you know I don't know if I can really dedicate my life to Christ why don't you why don't don't you the benefits are unbelievable you go to work and you say what's my benefits how much weeks do I yet come on what's my health benefit Dental benefit what's this benefit what's that benefit you're more concerned about your benefits at work and you are in Christ but if you're a tile Ripper amen you will break through get in the presence of God and see the benefits that come down look at that rope oh just a second three years later three years later Joanne comes and says I want a baby why can't I be like other women sorry honey I know these are personal things why can't I be like other women just have babies said there's always a reason honey I'm a deacon I'm at the back of the church and the pastor P Bisal goes right by me says No prayers this morning I just told Joan we'll go to church and put in prayer brother Ed says hold the prayer request okay after after the service he or when he came to the pulpit he says you wonder why I I never took any prayer requests this morning he says because the Bible says these signs follow I want to preach the word this morning and I want to see signs following amen and so we waited till all people were prayed for and brother bisco went into the little office that he had sister Joanne was on the organ over there and I'm standing at the back and there's only two of us in the room and brother red comes out of that little door and comes to the front and says honey what would you like she said Daddy I want a baby I want a baby well you know as women go through these things and and it was that time and and brother Bisal just said let him come or let it come say it honey let life come now you want to talk about the third pull you people get all the great Mysteries of the third pole Saints we have the third pull he said just wait till the council tightens up we see it in part but when it happens then you will see it fully manifested he said let life come now there's that L benefits I'll take the benefits but not to be undone because Joel couldn't be a natural-born baby because he would feel sort of a little bit less than two Supernatural Brothers oh we're Supernatural you're just normal no three years later brother Ed we want a baby brother Ed prays for us no fuss no must and he's gone to five weeks to India he didn't fly there for the weekend or for just the week of services five weeks brother Ron five weeks brother bis as he prayed for us he left within that next two weeks Joanne found out she's pregnant again but now what happened brother Ed's in India he's in prayer and the Holy Spirit speaks to him and says you'll have a grandson and his name will be Joel and he goes out of his room he says s Rose write this down on your calendar brother Ron you know all about that because all the people all the critics as we read about the phes they reasoned amongst them and said after the fact I God told me no God told him he doesn't know we're expecting and we and I thought you know hey the third one's got to be a girl and I always oh AJ here we [Laughter] go well we wanted Angela we wanted Angela so brother R was trying to help our unbelief I faith I mean and he bought a little dress for Joanna and Switzerland and and and pretty dress and all all these the little things and everything but when the time came here comes a head and I go it better be a boy and as it as the child was birthed God blessed our home with our third son he takes a man who's mentally insane lost in the drug scene in the world trying to find himself don't knowing anything but God and mercy brought a man of God from Toronto to Cloverdale his girls would go to our high school they would witness to us in school and out of our little school I I how many honey 15 18 some odd got saved I'm one of them I'm one of them so we can turn you around now you say well brother Tom our children don't know anything what you're talking about and I I say glory be to Jesus because I always say and I've preached it from when I first started the keeping power to me is as great or greater than the delivering power and people say I got to go in the world you do not you need to tell that devil devil I'm a tile Ripper you can't get me you can't have me I'm a born again son of God [Applause] Hallelujah and thus the same holy ghost that delivered me it's the same holy ghost that saves you keeps you holds you and manifests through you [Music] Hallelujah so now the benefits let's get into the benefits you you go to your work man I I I went to get some skin stuff because I you know as you I get flaky skin for some reason they say it's old age or something but I don't receive that I'm not old somebody said how old are you anyway I told them the number they just about fainted so I'm not telling you I'm 90 so anyways you you go there and how much is that are you kidding me I've got benefits well your benefits that only cover so much but let me tell you about the benefits of Jesus he covers it all he covers it all amen there's not any hold backs he wants to pour it out more than you want to receive it Hallelujah so Joshua Joshua wanted to know what his benefits were he said your benefits are from there to there to there knock out the Canaanite knock out the jebusite knock out the hittite come on we're tile Wreckers remember we're knocking out the devil out of our [Applause] land don't put up with it you've got an example as a fighter of all fighters that I know of I'm going to buy him some Golden Gloves uh-huh you know what Golden Gloves are anybody here know what boxing is all about Golden Gloves is the top of the food chain WAP take that devil yes sir oh by the way boo Hallelujah we believe the same God same message same power power same benefits yes sir I don't care what's in your land who's in your land or what's troubling you we don't sit down a bunch of seat sitters criticizers reason makers you know reason you know why reason is is is is is a bad bad word it comes from the Greek word logos logos logic reason it hates Faith it's hostile the Greek says hostile to Faith hostile it's just reasonable so I had to preach a message we are the most unreasonable people on the planet because we don't reason we're not by are Logistics people we are word people brother Ken when he first got saved a friend of mine my brother-in-law he went to the United Church and his Minister his parents wanted to see the minister so he goes sees the minister and Minister puts his arm around he says Kenny I hear you're getting a little religious no Ken says I'm not getting religious I'm a Christian he says well we'll talk about that um he says you know Kenny he says you don't have to be a fanatic he says really he says iron floats on water you know your Bible right of course you do he says we know Iron does not float now Ken saved about n a couple months and Ken sends to him he says listen if the Bible say says iron floats iron floats and he says okay Kenny out the door you go we're unreasonable right it's unreasonable that a a Balsa would Arc would habitate a bunch of animals and withstand the storms huh it's unreasonable but it did it it's unreasonable that you believe the word of God and it keeps you saves you fills you but it does yes it does hallelujah have you found it so yes sir listen you're not in a bar right you know we didn't have bars open on Sunday but now we have bars open on Sunday they're open seven days a week you have every excuse in the book to go to a bar but the god in you will not defile and they call us insane they make dope that I did that was illegal that go to jail for 5 years now it's legal and they sell it in the stores don't tell me this world's not gone insane and then people come against this message and an angel confirms that Prophet time and time and time and time again they are too late too late it has saved me filled me watched over me this message is alive Hallelujah Johnny come lately gets on the internet who are

here why don't you just come right here just stand on the side now now he's gone on but there's a bride Hallelujah she's riding this Trail again yes sir what he did in that Ministry he's doing in this ministry he's the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] Hallelujah like Michael said last night everybody wants to hear their voice voices preach about it huh voices he says all those voices are is to deaden the voice of the Supernatural and let me tell you every one of their voices aren't even the time don't have the second millisecond to listen to that garbage and the thing of it is you don't know he was one of my best friends grew up with him knew his family but an enemy of the Cross and I'll tell it like it is they blasphemed my God sir they put a light over the Beetles because of a light bulb and and said the same light that was over William brandom is now over this I say I abod ick and people leave because of that I know him I know his family my sons know their family listen if you got anyone of your friends that are in that py condition bring them to church bring them to church because they got to get out of that mindset state if you would see their lives one of my daughter-in-laws go to to get something out of a for a um what do you call it a recipe now I won't look at you sisters you never put one of those uh flavors that you have to go get huh put it in a recipe and you and and you still have at least the bottle still in the in the closet but you go there and you find them there buying beer and doing what they're doing listen they call us out I'm

just rest in in in believing for the Salvation of their souls take your land take your promise you're living in the land of the free I saw so much patriotism this week I said I think I told Michael I was Michael or one of the boys we're stepping up the curve and said man I almost want to be an American but before I could finish the sentence I realized I'm not Canadian I'm not American I'm not African I'm a Christian amen they got their freedom fighters and so do we Hallelujah I got William Mar and ROM he was a freedom fighter I got an Edward Frederick bcll Freedom Fighter an Andrew Spencer a Michael Ray a Ron Spencer come on William we are Freedom Fighters Hallelujah I'll use your line what time do we start but what Michael doesn't know I do now there's a clock there you've been gracious you've been very gracious go just going a little more Al righty can you turn to Mark 5 Mark chapter 5 verse 37 oh how I love him how I adore him Mark 5: 7 37 you got it oh you got it there okay I'm wondering why are you looking over my head I know I'm short but I didn't know I was that short look at your Bibles you are okay Mark 5:37 and he suffered no man to follow him Peter James and John faith hope and charity he took with him and he come into a house of a ruler synagogue and he seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greetly greatly and when he came in he said unto them why make ye this Ado and why Weep the damsel read it with me is okay you got that right I'll take what Jesus said I'll take what Jesus he's got all the unbelief out of the room he brings faith hope and charity in the room now hope isn't hope Soul you got that right hope is a high expectation of fulfillment that's what the Greek means so it's not oh I hope that happens to a Believer when you hope you have an expectation of fulfillment of what you're hoping for you got that so faith hope and charity walks in with Jesus the word and they laugh asked him here's the sitter buyers here's the sitter buyers and they laughed him to scorn but when he put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him entered into where the damsel was lying and he took the damsel by his hand and said unto her talitha Kumi which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise Hallelujah the resurrection has been spoken arise and the Lord himself shall descend with a shout it has been spoken and they that remain shall be caught up together with them it has been [Music] spoken it's not hope so let's drive out all the unbelievers the center buyers as I'm in a room of tile rippers Liberator [Applause] Fighters damsel I say unto thee arise Right Here Comes one of of my favorite quotes Pastor Spencer Here Comes one of my favorite quotes out of gyrus if you want to put it down but in that Lord Jesus he was possessed with a power that went beyond these Earthbound limitations yes sir he walked over to that cold stiff form of a dead girl oh Hallelujah now if a

I don't care for those kind of people I love Faith Rippers uhhuh amen people that'll take the word of the Lord the sword of the Lord that is in your mouth and cleave the head off of that demon and so now he walked over to that stiff still form of a dead girl took her by the hand looked all around where's everybody they're outside making fun criticizing everything he was possessed with a power that he could speak into another world come on listen Saints the son of man was giving us an example of what a son of man will do in this hour what was I wanted to preach another message the blending of Eternity where there's two worlds colliding as brother bisc preached on we've been living in that Revelation for a long time angels are in your attendance right now open our eyes there's more more for

to stand in your midst to look in your faces and to see the glory of God all over you I want to say to the Lord how great How Great Is Our God Amen brother Ron Hallelujah you can say stand and if you like I just got one more quote is that okay oh yeah I'm sorry for saying he's that okay I said I wouldn't say I do okay and I've said it more times than I've ever said it he said just think just think he says just talking about he said to realize when you walk out there and go to your car when you walk out there and go to your car Angels take their position beside you the next time you get behind the wheel of that car say God bless you angel I'm serious because your Prophet is telling you that's right listen I haven't finished yet realize when you walk out there get in your car Angels take their position by your side when you walk out yonder to that man so unloving to you the holy spirit is standing right above you and the angels are all around you the Bible says so the angels of God are compassed and camped about those that fear the lord they don't go back to Heaven they Camp around you I believe it do you have time for a testimony okay brother Ron is that okay I talk about that angel of the Lord huh we're in China all right now that you have to remember I'm the oldest of the group I don't say group there's brother Murphy myself Brother David and brother Caleb brother run and I'm the oldest by many years and brother Ron is exhausted I don't know how many services they packed for us a bunch and we were in this service and I've been there about 12 times now 10 or 12 times I can't I have to sit down and I don't want to exaggerate and I don't want to under and I so you get to know the ones that were there last year got saved this year and you know as the years go by and so so we're at brother David's Church and brother Ron says I think we'll have a prayer line I said okay brother Ron if you feel up to it he says I do I said okay so the brothers get all lined up and and one after another one after another one after another one after another and then I start to realize hey they've been are here before like this is their third time I am soak and wet my voice is shot and brother Ron is staggering a little bit and I go brother Ron I said these people are coming around three times already he said wouldn't [Applause] you wouldn't you don't take for granted what you got no sir a prophet is without honor in his own country do Heap Honor on those that God's given you so now we leave that City and we go to another city now Murphy by the way brother Murphy Wong who is my one of my bestest friends he's flat out he's on he's he is so exhausted cuz he's interp in every word so not only brother Ron is speaking he's interpreting what brother Ron's saying he's talking to them in Chinese he's coming back telling Ron their need in in English going back to Chinese and we're talking 300 times and he goes down the Brothers carry him out brother Ron goes home and guess who's there me I said hey this is not fair my two friends leave me so anyways I did the best I could and out I went Murphy's still in the back and the brothers are trying to bring him to brother Ron's gone to the hotel totally exhausted then we finally got Murphy to come to they carry him in the car carrying the hotel they got I walk into his room they got massagers from his head to his toes wake up Murphy no holiday no holiday so now we go to Hano we get to Hano and brother Ron says I think well Bine I said anything you say brother Ron I'm with you all you leave I leave uh-huh uh-huh was not born yesterday he said I all right so we're having a prayer line prayer line prayer line and brother Ron turns to me he says call Brother Caleb's wife call Brother Caleb's wife he's the pastor in Shanghai but they Outreach to Hano which is a university town which we call a town it's only got what Michael 2 million yeah small town in China Shanghai is 35 million that's the size of all Canada one city so we are there and brother Ron's exhausted we just go from one meeting to another meeting to another meeting and brother Ron says to me he says brother Tom tell brother Caleb to get his wife and so brother Caleb goes gets his wife and uh I knew them before they were even married they got a seven-year-old 5-year-old boy at the time now I've never been invited to their house and I hope they don't hear this tape oh they can hear this tape cuz she got delivered anyways I had of myself we call I she's never invited and and and the Chinese custom is you have your friends over have have people over I want to be invited over how long can I stay huh so it's a it's like have tea like just have tea right so we've never been invited and so and that's a little perplexing so when brother Ron flew in two days before me I think a day maybe ahead of me and then I flew in because brother that was when brother bisell said the big boys can take care of themselves yeah sh take that off and so we made it to China anyways we're and this is ending our meetings and he says get brother Caleb's wife and I said okay but as we landed we were at the luggage pickup I said to to her I said we're coming over to your house for tea this year well I didn't know what I was saying she was freaking out she has this thing called called what's it called hun OCD bad very bad so I don't know this I just don't know I know that I've never been invited over apparently she'd have to clean every doorknob in every place I sat and everything else okay so brother Ron asked specifically for brother Caleb's wife to come she is n emotional she comes to the man of God he just lays hands on her she collapses like oh my goodness she's going to break her kneecaps I mean honestly you know I'm carnal right at that moment only one time moment and I go what and brother Ron prays for it and and I'm going this is way way in Supernatural because brother Ron doesn't know anything and I don't hardly know anything and then brother Ron turns to me he says let's go I go why he says I just saw the angel of the Lord go through that ceiling there's another man young Mike help me the young one young one he is up in the three self Church hierarchy in college and uh the brothers have been working with him he's been coming to all their services and and he's got now 10 12 year old boy standing right beside him who knows zero English zero English and so when brother Ron turns to me he says let's go brother Tom the angel of the Lord just left the building I go I said if he's left I'm going and we take the man of God out the door and we go I turn like this before I go and and young one he's talking Chinese to his son and then he turns to me and he says my son who doesn't know any English has just told me he just saw the angel of the Lord go through the ceiling and he hasn't even given his heart to the Lord God works in Supernatural ways and I told brother Ron that young one is serving God he's out of the system loves the word and praise be to God that's what your pastor does I'm not doing that for an in accelator Friendship we're friends anyways but that's the other side of the story you might not have heard and I can say as brother bcll has for so many years I am a witness that my God is real and he's real in my soul and thank you brother Spencer brother Andrew for this invitation I'm I'm so

through this building Lord Jesus May the same one that would stand there when when they would ask the question when brother Brandon would ask the question do you believe that this ministry could be that of Malachi 4 and our brother said it has every sign of it and you came into the car Lord you came into the car and every time you come Lord something good always happens may we put our eyes towards the horizon that something good is about to happen oh God may you place our desires in a place father that we'll know that it was you Lord that let it let it happen just that way Lord God lord

personal needs God I'm going to be a tower wrecker I'm going to do what it takes I'm going to move past my fears I'm going to move past what I thought and I'm going to get myself in your presence because you're in the room you don't just have the ability Lord to say thy sins are forgiven but you can say rise up and walk away from that and return not to it father I pray today that today would be a pivotal moment in the Supernatural for these brothers and sisters that they could pin it down father that they met the god of Hebrews 138 I ask Lord your blessings on our brother Tom and brother Michael Lord just now they poured out their hearts this weekend we've been so graced by the presence of Angels in this room Angels means Messengers Messengers from heaven and two angels came and stood
