devil seems to have fought them about every turn but that just shows that uh amen that the devil is trying to stop something really good and so whenever you see the devil working hard against you always remember there's a blessing just on the other side of the trial so many times we get so consumed by the storm that we're going through if you could only just see the Rainbow on the other side and and the sun that's shining for you and so God bless you this morning thank you for putting up with me for a moment there to to make those announcements if you will stand with me at Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chap 11 and verse 1 I want to speak to you this morning and we're in a precious season even now on the season of Supernatural and this is more than just for a 2,000 year ago text but you're the people that are in the season of Supernatural amen Hebrews 11 and verse 1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear maybe you have a need on your heart You' just like to lift before the Lord amen amen let's pray how many of you believe God can come this evening and touch your hearts and what your need is can happen before you leave the building I believe that I believe that almighty God what an awesome presence is in this building as we raise our hands before you we real realize that we're Defying Gravity and we raise it to a living God a God that hears and answers prayer every prayer that we pray you hear it now sometimes it takes a while for the answer to come but the moment that we pray the answer is on the way now father we're your children and we have a position as Sons and Daughters of God and I ask you now that you will touch our hearts and minister to us now father maybe our hands went up because of prodal needing to come home and maybe it looks like an impossible situation but father you're a god of impossibilities and I ask you that father that you'd come on the scene today and touch our hearts and minister to us today Lord we're thankful for all that you have done and Lord we ask you to give us strength even as we stand in this Pulpit today Lord we're just anxious in a lot of ways Lord to see your results touch us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we pray pray amen and amen amen God bless you you may be seated on the last service that I spoke to you I touched something off when Noah was standing watching two by two animals come he had preached 120 years he had built an ark exactly like God told him to build it amen but when God be to call for animals in that realm to start moving toward the ark the only Arc of safety maybe others had built arcs but no animals were headed in their directions two counts two elephants two giraffes male female begin to make their move in that direction I'd like to say to you that we're in the season of kind of that kind of a moving there's a gathering that is happening our governments are changing we've watched in the last month our government changing in a direction that maybe some might think impossible but if you could look at the scriptures and look at what's going on they're they're even looking at it as as a realm of uh Messiah coming to the Earth let me just say that's a man Messiah but there is a messiah coming and we must realize that this is not some intellectual faith that we've got for the message we must realize that this is a super natural message that's right and we not everything is we can reason out or say is it's got to be this way or one plus one or not everything that we can see is is we can explain this message is Supernatural right this message is Supernatural even when you listen to brother Brandon preaches sermons like a greater than Solomon is here 23 different times to different audiences or or the trial or the Seven Seals or or God hidden revealed in Simplicity every service held a supernatural element I want to lift it just to a to another level that same angels with us right right and maybe you you come to the service and and you come and you sit in the service and the service goes a couple of hours what I want you to be aware to catch the supernatural anointing of God not just here but around the world we're not a one-man Ministry we are a Ministry around the world and every Ministry has its different place we're not copying one another we're not trying to be better than one another we're a team that's right we're a family right rich or poor we're a family greatly gifted or or maybe gifted less by men's things let me just say but we're a family we're a team amen but the main thing that we want to catch is him are you with me right now I want you to understand and this is just a principle I want to speak to you on God takes something and make something out of nothing he can take nothing and make something right right so when the devil tells you you're nothing come on you can say for the first time you were right devil you're right I was nothing but God took nothing and made [Applause] something now brother random says in the Church of the Living God this morning lays the power to heal all sickness in the Church of the Living God lays the power to overcome all temptation in the possession of the church of the Living God this morning lays the power to change sin and throw it away and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost hlj so that power is in this service yes sir amen hallelujah yes sir are you with me brother brandham says this and I just go to another quote he said there was another young man that come into the world one time and he died at 33 and he conquered everything thing that could be conquered and when he was on the earth he conquered passion Pride he conquered sickness he conquered devils and when he died he conquered [Music] death and when he arose he conquered hell and he went up and he conquered everything that was against Mankind and wi of the Vine and Wine Press of God and crushed it down and conquered death hell and the grave sickness formalities everything else everything it all and arose on the third day and conquered the atmospheres AB of of of above and cut the Mist between God and man and connected and connected hell and the Earth Heaven and the Earth together Heaven and the Earth together he connected it right L there he stands the mighty conqueror since he since he rent The Veil there he is he has the keys when you have keys you have access that's right whether it's the key to the city the key to the nation the key to your house come on that's right I don't have the key to your house I have to knock on the door but I have a key to my house I don't have to ask entrance into my house it's my house and God has the keys to death hell and the grave we are the keys to Heaven that has been given to us we don't have to beg to go we have been given the [Music] right brother Brenham says and I love this quote and you've heard me quoted before the devil hates me and I know he hates you too and he said he's my enemy but as long as God is my friend I don't have no fear of him I just drive him WR right on back and take the word of God and move right on and back of he said out of his place that he thinks he's holding he hasn't got no strongholds he has absolutely legally defeated in every place I like this the devil hasn't got one legal right nowhere brother Ron our home we have such difficulty cast him out he battles my mind cast him out are you with me we're not some intellectual group Andy trying to think our way through it you have been born with the seed of God on the inside of you that has been quickened to life and it's a supernatural power I want you to just think about this first of all a word is a thought right and then it's spoken and it becomes a word and listen after it's spoken it has power to it are you with me now after it's spoken it has power to it and it has an effect to it and it has results to it are you with me I'm going somewhere with these thoughts because of who you are other people may say the same thing that you are saying quoting the same scriptures that you are quoting but Sam because of who you are you have a more Authority than the angels that are in heaven you have been given more than just power you have been given Authority brother Ron but I want Power listen if you've got author it expresses [Applause] power now let me just tell you this you are a representative and an ambassador of this message Lord people on your job people in your community may never hear a tape they may never read a book but they see the message interpreted in your life because the inspired word came to the inspired seat and listen Maybe the same message came to them but it didn't Inspire anything there but you heard it and immediately that seed said that's the truth and maybe you couldn't even understand why did it come to life in you and it didn't come to life in this individual but because he placed something there listen no man can place that seed there God placed that seed on the inside of you when before the found of the [Music] world we are here this is our moment this is our time to declare the new creation did you catch that this message makes you a new creation you Lord we were together Friday evening and I thought about people that were assembled together maybe I'll call a couple of names here there's Josh a former biker there's Denny a former wrestler there's William a former Angel but let me Express this to you we all had a history right well brother Ron I wasn't nothing bad really you inherited you inherited by your natural birth things that you were guilty for right we announced brother Ben and sister Rebecca's baby already while in the womb sins of their forefathers are headed in the direction they won't teach that child to lie they won't teach that child to cheat they won't teach that child to do wrong right but it's in the inherited nature so God had a fix he had a fix for that and a secret believer came to him at night and Jesus told him you must be born again so I want to say to you you are here to express the new creation [Applause] now sometimes we get the idea this is just a you know this is just temporary thing or this is just a phase that we're going through this is just churchianity I'm just going to try this a little while but if you've got a seed inside of you you realize that you are as Eternal as God is eternal there's no end to this right it's only going to get [Music] better sir it's only going to get better but brother Ron but I'm getting older and my body's falling apart maybe I'm going to a nursing home it's only going to get better don't look at the temporary don't look at what the doctor say you keep your eyes on it's going to get better sir [Music] you know there's no Miracles without a mess there's no Miracles without a mess that's right that that sentence C caus emotions no Miracles without a mess there's no ice coming open that was blind without a long time of blindness deaf ears coming open without a great season of of or even a a womb that couldn't have children and listen there was quite a long time maybe Sarah was childless are you with me yes sir how many headaches did you go through and you suffered great great despair you go through hard seasons of your life Ms you went through hard Seasons but there came a time to where it could you could say the curse is over sometimes we think well this is just a season this is just a difficult season Abraham when he was childless when he was childless and in it if in his in his physical being he laughed at God but God brought him out before the sand and ask him can you count them can you count them this is God talking to him right this isn't the mayor of the city right this isn't somebody want to just make him feel good so shall thy seed be amen now let me explain something to you God wasn't looking at Sand he had a book yes sir he already had their picture listen with God it's not an if I hope I can drive this to you with God it's not an if it's not an if I can stimulate you excite you to get you the point it's not an if so it's not if you can make it that ought to make you hand off hang off these chandeliers we're not here to if we can make it we're going to make it brother Brandon would use a term very early in his ministry and he called it the Deep calling to the deep and he said there's got to be a deep to respond to it sometime people go well I've went too far does he still pull does he still pull on you sister Melissa did he still pull brother Lawrence I'm looking for you brother Lawrence was gone for a long time and he said he was the delivery truck I I don't know how to explain this but he was a delivery truck driver and he would drive by this place and he said every time I drove by something pulled me up on this hill let me just say it's not it's not up to where you're hanging on or where you're trying to get yourself back come on I'm preaching to you now come on listen to you God's not in the game he's not in the game to lose Chester that's right if you were once your his seed you're always his seed get that brother Tom did you get that if you were ever his seed if you were ever his seed you're always his seed brother BR would make a statement he says before there was a fin on a fish's back there had to be water first for him to swim in that's right he done never had a fin if there was no water brother onon that's so simple so when God put a thirst inside of you he had a thirst to respond to it he had a Memphis girl that was blind and he had a fix he had a blind man in Bombay and he had a fix there was a woman in Mexico carrying a dead baby and he had a fix are you getting the point had he right had two sons and he had a fix you rais your hand before we started preaching God's got to fix now I want to tie some things together in Luke chap 1 verse 26 and the six month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into the city of Galilee named La Nazareth to a virgin ESP spouse to a man whose name was Joseph the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary God didn't search through the city to find her he knew exactly where she was at and he didn't go to a dozen dozen virgins he went to the one when it's a supernatural gospel he searches you out why are you preaching that so strong to help you with your struggle with Humanity because Humanity will make you want to give up Humanity will make you want to struggle Humanity will ask every question of why that there can be but if you can look through what God sees it will settle it forever because if God ever saw you here he'll see you there and there's already a seat at the marriage supper of the lamb for you he's just got to get you there are you with me now it's already there don't worry they're not going to be sitting extra seats it's already there for you amen he's already got a place prepared for you in the new city we get so upset about our politics here I love that sermon last night I love that last night we got a Kingdom coming that's not going to have a hospital it's not going to have a war department it's not going to have a police station it's going to be peace peace and brother brandham said he he's got your place there future home he said in every property the River of Life flows through it and he's made it just to your liking and you don't even know what you like brother Ron I know exactly what I like well why do you keep painting your house rooms come on come on now if you really knew what you liked you'd have built one house you'd have painted it the color that you wanted it you'd have did it all right but every one of us build a house and then when we're done we went I wish I'd built a cupboard bigger I you know I I wish i' kept I wish I'd have painted that light blue I wish i' have painted that beige God don't go to 100 women he goes to one now how do we believe the testimony of a teenage girl so many people criticize brother brandham and they want 50 60 years ago they want to they want to criticize and blog and do all different kind of thing listen let's go back 2,000 years ago to a teenage girl and God stops her an angel comes to her an angel comes and speaks to her look at these girls sitting here and an angel comes and speaks to her there isn't a hundred Witnesses with them and after this visit she's pregnant Hey listen folks she meets the angel the angel gives her the commission am she doesn't have a a 2hour sermon she just accepts it she just accepts it she doesn't decipher it go home and have to run it through the computer and see if it'll be all right she just accepts it I believe that's your truth listen folks she left the meeting with the angel pregnant she never felt nothing that's right you talking about a supernatural birth it wasn't part Mary and part God it was all God God only needed to borrow her womb right amen you can build every statue in the world and we've got incredible reverence for Mary what pressure that was upon on her but she's not God but what came out of her womb was [Music] God and I want to just draw that just for a moment if you only are looking at you you'll get disappointed OED if you're only looking at other people in the church you'll get disappointed right but if you can look beyond what you see and see that Supernatural seed that is on the inside of that you're going to spend etern knows these words and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus here's the important words and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end and then M and then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee and therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God prophecy every Prophet had a part of God in them Moses had a part Joseph had a part Noah had a part listen let me say it like this so you'll get it there were times that you saw God in Noah and then there was times you saw Noah there were times that you saw God in Abraham then there was times you saw Abraham there was times that you saw God in Moses and then there was times that you saw Moses there's times that you see God and Zach and then there's times that you see God or Zach is that fair there's times you see God in Brenda and then there's times you see Brenda I'm not going to you sister Connie I've learned I need to live are we are we are we there amen so it's supernatural Isaiah 7 verse4 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign behold of Virgin shall conceive and shall bear a son and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel now let's just think for a moment you brother Ron I've heard that a thousand times good can you imagine being Isaiah and Isaiah has felt the anointing of God like never before and those words slip out of his lips and now he can't explain it all I know it was God but they have slipped out of his lips Behold a virgin shall conceive it's impossible how are you going to think that one out Isaiah all I know was I felt such an anointing I felt such an anointing passed through me and he spoke through me can you imagine the blocks of that day can you imagine the scoffers of that day 10 20 years 30 40 50 60 70 years y'all call him a Prophet come on y'all call him a prophet he laid at the gate naked are you with me y call him a prophet what about our Prophet come on he preaches future home because you're the people going to live there come on come on Church yes sir I don't care what the says I don't care how how long time goes well brother Ron we 60 years since he passed away don't matter the word is [Applause] eternal we had to wait till you got here brother Ben the Rapture could not happen till every seed and I'm not just talking about you I'm talking about that little beautiful girl sitting beside of you God's not a man in his thoughts this is a Supernatural Supernatural message now God says in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 15 now he's going to talk about you said this last night Two Worlds I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed listen there in the garden to where only moments ago was perfect no leaves fell off the trees no animals died there was not a predator there no conceptions were taking place not a sin happened until today and now God is declaring a war on the devil I'm going to put enmity between the Saints between the seeds of darkness and the seeds of light Hallelujah listen Church you will never feel at home here that's right I want to say you will never feel comfortable in this world this is not your world you will Express dominion over it while you're here and keep the devil under your feet but this is not our home [Applause] I'm coming to it I want you to think about it just for a few things and I'll I'll touch on this in a couple of weeks Joseph had to have a supernatural visitation to take care of her let's just be very honest God not only has to speak to Mary but he has to speak to Joseph that's right then the first time she calls Jesus's name let's just think about how powerful something is made from nothing we talk about haty right and those two boys what about a death baby right right what we're talking about different medical conditions in those days right you just don't run to the doctor right you have a problem she's carrying a dead baby but in that time they had to wait till the the conception would take place and the baby would be born knowing it was dead all the way how heartbreaking that would be the difficulty in that home carry and after all these years finally having a baby in a womb and that baby's dead they prayed for it they prayed for it they prayed for him preaching to you and she gets a visit from Mary and she tells of this Supernatural message that she stepped into and the power of the message when she calls his name Jesus amen the angel said his name Shall be Called Jesus and in the moment of thought to word to results the same let there be that said let there be a sun Let There Be moons that same power came through her lips and spontaneously a baby begin to LEAP let's just say it how it is a prophet got the Holy Ghost in his mother's womb [Applause] do you believe you know sometimes it's great difficulty when it comes now to individuals we can ask a congregation do you believe you know a couple hundred people they go we believe brother Ron but all of a sudden it becomes you on and it's you going to get water it's you on your way to carry water to the whiskey skill it's you meeting angels in Arizona you're confronted with the message and maybe you just got a book I us with brother bisco one time brother bisco met a man at a fuel station two stories let me let me tell the one that that I'm 100% sure on a man is shining shoes brother bisc was having his shoes shine and he looked down and there's a message book laying there and he said where'd you get the book he said I got it out of the trash and he said I wish I I wish I could get more of these books he didn't know he was preaching he was shining his shoes of one of the greatest preachers that ever lived that had been in the car with the angel of the Lord and he said I got that out of the trash listen God's seed will find its place sister Gabrielle one one time I came to service I was in my office and the Lord spoke to me and he said today is Wesley's day I'll come to your I'm coming to their house he couldn't walk he's not quite old enough to understand all this now but that was a generational situation he couldn't walk if left in that condition you he'd been a wheelchair today we know that but it's not if but that service changed Wesley's life that service changed Wesley's life brother Roger how many years ago was it Billy Andrews would you just give a guess 20 some years that's that's 23 years ago brother Billy Andrews is backwards and forwards across this pull pit he was praying for sister Hoover at the time how many remember Sister Hoover sister Hoover would have a stroke later and lay in the nursing home for nine years and he was praying for sister [Music] Hoover and he turns to you brother Roger we had pews at the time and you were sitting about where brother Jeremy is sitting and he said there's a pillar of fire over top of you and you'll need God before the night's over a that right and brother Roger's heart exploded that night and he was rushed to the hospital and brother Homer and myself went to the hospital to where he was at and those doctors gave him zero hope zero hope and so his daughter Debbie that's went on to be with the Lord his W his his daughter begged and because of her position got a flight to UVA and they kept him alive on a machine seemed like it was a they called it a Ford machine or something like that and so anyway they kept him alive he's alive today he's alive today but brother Ronnie has trouble we're hum we are humans but he's [Applause] alive brother Randy's fa cancer for over a decade but he's a God that knows how to preserve you it doesn't matter what doctor say he knows how to preserve you oh amen you wanted to find a man that would love you for who you are and what you are come on but in that realm your your body is full of hair you have a perfect body there and maybe you were looking for somebody that would overlook your imperfections but God don't look at your imperfection amen he don't look at your imperfection he looks at what he sees so while the songs were going on last night the Lord spoke to me where's your sister could she come come baby do you believe do you believe you believe I want to show you something hey baby dog can you help me 15 years ago I was in a fire and my skin was burned until it was burned to where I had no skin and was burned to the meat and they never thought it would maybe ever grow back so they took skin from my legs and they begin to patch it over hoping it would take you know what they told me I asked them I said why didn't you do it earlier earlier and they told me said Ron we don't put new skin on dead people we never thought you'd live you see that skin I want you to feel it it's like a baby skin it yeah now those dots are those dots are bad things but one day it'll all be pure I told your father this morning that God dealt with me in the service last night to ask you do you believe both of you fight with skin conditions and some sometimes Services become Supernatural and it happens to be your turn maybe I'm not your healer but he sure is I want you to watch your skin over the next little bit God knows how to make it well say brother Ron have you seen it done before they told a sister she was going to die because her skin was becoming leather and she's a preacher's wife and she's totally well today I told a preacher that we love very much he was born with a condition and he wouldn't live because his skin was so bad and he's got Pure skin even today at near 60 years old he's Jason Watkins and the same God that met Mary has came to your house father in the name of
