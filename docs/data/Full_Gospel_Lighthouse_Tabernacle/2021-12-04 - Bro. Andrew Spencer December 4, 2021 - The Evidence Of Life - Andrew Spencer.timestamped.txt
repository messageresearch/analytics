[50:39] and we we certainly certainly love
[50:42] brother william and his family and he's
[50:44] such a part of our immediate family and
[50:46] such a part of our church family and
[50:48] we're just blessed to have brother
[50:50] william amongst us amen
[50:52] psalms chapter 63
[50:54] and as we spoke from this this scripture
[50:57] several weekends in a row here i'd like
[51:00] to speak from it again but i'd like to
[51:01] speak to you this evening on the
[51:03] evidence the evidence of life
[51:07] this is a psalm of david when he was in
[51:09] the wilderness of judah
[51:11] he said oh god thou art my god
[51:13] is it your god this evening
[51:16] early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth
[51:19] for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a
[51:21] dry and thirsty land
[51:23] where no water is
[51:25] to see thy power and thy glory so as i
[51:28] have seen thee in the sanctuary
[51:31] because thy loving kindness is better
[51:32] than life
[51:34] my lips shall praise thee thus will i
[51:37] bless thee while i live i will lift up
[51:39] my hands in thy name
[51:41] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[51:44] marrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[51:47] praise thee with joyful lips when i
[51:50] remember thee upon my bed and meditate
[51:52] on thee
[51:53] in the night watches
[51:55] because thou has been my help
[51:57] therefore in the shadow of thy wings
[52:00] will i rejoice let's just take our
[52:02] hearts and our needs before
[52:04] the maker of heaven just now
[52:06] heavenly father we approach your throne

[52:15] scepter of mercy and grace lord upon our

[52:20] situations you see us in our life and
[52:22] you see
[52:23] every detail of it father
[52:26] lord we know that you are the designer
[52:28] of it all and we're so thankful to have
[52:30] a father that knows us by name
[52:33] lord i pray that you would just come in

[52:53] i ask god that you would extend your
[52:54] mercy to every uplifted request and
[52:57] every unspoken request we pray that you
[52:59] would show yourself god to not set us
[53:02] down over in a corner and begin to use
[53:03] our body like never before
[53:06] we ask these things in the name of the
[53:07] lord amen you can be seated this evening
[53:15] so sad would like to speak to you on the
[53:16] evidence of life
[53:18] brother branham
[53:20] speaks on this subject of life or the
[53:22] path of life and thirsting for life many
[53:24] times
[53:26] but in in 1958 when he was preaching in
[53:29] in bangor there he he made this he made
[53:31] this comment and i was going over these
[53:33] i went over about every every sermon
[53:36] brother branham spoke on on life
[53:38] and brother branham this this this text
[53:40] stuck out to me said when i read that
[53:42] scripture verse he said i thought
[53:44] what could the prophet be meaning it's
[53:46] an unusual text thy loving kindness is
[53:48] better than life i thought there must be
[53:51] many interpretations to life and it
[53:53] could not mean the life that we now live
[53:56] in the flesh because that life has
[53:57] heartaches that life has sorrow and that
[54:00] life gets so bad sometime
[54:02] sometimes until men want to take piss
[54:05] take a pistol and blow his brains out so
[54:08] that couldn't be the life that he was
[54:09] talking about but it must be another
[54:11] life
[54:13] it must be another life that he's
[54:14] speaking of that life gets so miserable
[54:17] until people climb to a high tower and
[54:19] jump off and commit suicide
[54:22] they take poison and they take poison
[54:25] and tens of thousands a year over the
[54:27] united states where we where we ought to
[54:29] be living at the highest rate of life so
[54:32] it must have
[54:33] another interpretation
[54:35] so as david takes this text that thy
[54:37] loving kindness is better than life and
[54:40] we realize that that the life that that
[54:42] david was speaking of is not this life
[54:44] in the flesh but it was the life that
[54:47] only comes from above and then we go
[54:50] back and we begin to study in the bible
[54:52] that that in the beginning when god when
[54:54] we would look when god created man that
[54:56] god created adam and adam adam had the
[54:59] rights to life he had the rights to the
[55:01] tree of life and he never would have had
[55:03] to die because god began to breathe in
[55:05] him the breath
[55:07] of life but adam we know was told that
[55:10] he that the day that he eat off of the
[55:12] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[55:14] that day he would surely die but we know
[55:17] that day that adam when he began to eat
[55:20] off of that tree off of the tree of
[55:21] knowledge of good needle that he began
[55:23] to die from that time but we know that
[55:25] the bible would tell us that adam lived
[55:27] to be some 930 years old but what did he
[55:31] lose he lost the rights to that tree he
[55:34] lost the power he lost the he lost the
[55:36] virtue he lost the quality of life what
[55:39] did he do he lost the original life and
[55:42] we know that the book of deuteronomy it
[55:45] means two laws
[55:47] and god has two laws and it is that of
[55:49] the law of death and is that of the law
[55:52] of life and there we recognize when when
[55:55] eve in direct disobedience to what god
[55:58] had said had turned down life there on
[56:01] the other side of the picture we see
[56:03] that there is a redeemer that is going
[56:05] to step in and and to come back to give
[56:08] that original life and restore that life
[56:11] back to his believing sons back to his
[56:14] believing sons and daughters of god
[56:16] and paul would say in galatians 2 and
[56:19] verse 18 he said if i build again the
[56:22] things which i destroyed i make myself a
[56:25] transgressor can you imagine somebody
[56:27] going in and purposely building down
[56:30] burning down a city and then going back
[56:32] and building that up again and paul is
[56:35] saying that if i return again to the
[56:37] sins which i have abandoned i am i am
[56:41] the one and i take the full
[56:43] responsibility upon myself he said if i
[56:46] go in and build again
[56:47] on the things that i have destroyed i
[56:49] have myself had made myself return
[56:52] transgressor so you can no longer blame
[56:54] god on what you did because you went
[56:57] back and you went back to the mud hole
[56:59] that you came out of but notice what
[57:01] paul says in verse 19 he said for i
[57:04] through the law am dead to the law that
[57:06] i might live unto god you see the law
[57:09] condemns you the law condemns you to
[57:11] death the law doesn't give you an escape
[57:13] route but the gospel gives you a way out
[57:16] the gospel gives you the access to life
[57:19] and we can come boldly before the throne
[57:22] and mercy of god but notice what he said
[57:24] in verse 20 he said i am crucified with
[57:27] christ nevertheless i live yet not i but
[57:30] christ that lives in me and the life
[57:33] which i now live in the flesh notice
[57:35] notice the life that he was living where
[57:38] did that life come from it was not the
[57:40] life that he had previously lived but it
[57:42] was a new life
[57:44] he said in the life which i now live in
[57:46] the flesh i live by the faith of the son
[57:49] of god who loved me and gave himself for
[57:52] me and jesus said in john 5 and 24 and
[57:56] verily verily i say unto you that he
[57:58] that heareth my word and believeth on
[58:00] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[58:04] and shall not come unto condemnation but
[58:07] is already passed from death unto life
[58:09] so it's an amazing thing to be able to
[58:11] recognize that you have already passed
[58:14] from death into life by accepting and
[58:16] believing it's not just a easy
[58:18] confession of i believe but this is
[58:21] hearing and doing and acting upon the
[58:24] very word of almighty god
[58:27] but the evidence of life is not the
[58:29] materialistic things that you have been
[58:31] given in life it's not how long that you
[58:33] live in life and many times when you
[58:35] hear us speak at a funeral you'll hear
[58:37] us say something about the dash in the
[58:40] person's life that there was a day that
[58:42] they began and there was a day that
[58:43] they're ending the day the dash is what
[58:46] really that person was and what they did
[58:49] with their life it's not how long you
[58:51] live that equates how powerful or the
[58:54] quality of your life but it's if you
[58:57] serve the author of life it's not
[58:59] happiness how happy you are in your life
[59:02] that determines the evidence of life
[59:04] it's not the family that surrounds you
[59:06] that determines your life but it is the
[59:08] ability to be able to say amen to the
[59:11] word of god that is the evidence of the
[59:14] holy ghost it is the evidence of life we
[59:18] know that god is
[59:20] life
[59:22] now notice notices this quote in
[59:25] possessing all things he said if you've
[59:27] never received the holy ghost as of yet
[59:30] and don't know nothing about it and
[59:31] something in your heart's telling you
[59:34] that you want it you stay right there
[59:38] can you say amen to the word of god
[59:40] that's eternal life that's what you're
[59:42] heir to stay right there and look satan
[59:45] right in the face and say you are the
[59:47] robber you are the one i've come to
[59:50] possess what jesus died for me to have
[59:53] now hand it back get out of my way
[59:57] just stand right there that's eternal
[59:59] life when you when you know that you're
[1:00:01] looking at the holy ghost and you
[1:00:02] haven't received it yet but you stand
[1:00:05] right there
[1:00:06] it's the greatest thing that you could
[1:00:08] ever attain in this life is the baptism
[1:00:11] of the holy ghost of not just on the
[1:00:13] flesh but on the inside of your soul
[1:00:16] that he sits there as the king of your
[1:00:18] heart and you stand right there and you
[1:00:20] can stand toe to toe with the devil and
[1:00:22] say you are the robber
[1:00:25] you are the one you have stood in my way
[1:00:28] all of my life you have stood in the
[1:00:30] path of me getting everything that i
[1:00:33] need in this life get out of my way
[1:00:38] then the first thing you know the holy
[1:00:40] ghost will pour upon you then something
[1:00:42] happens something will happen what is it
[1:00:44] god vindicated he keeps his word that's
[1:00:47] just exactly then see then after you see
[1:00:51] the word is vindicated then you that
[1:00:53] you're saved you do
[1:00:55] have the holy ghost then what
[1:00:58] abraham had won the victory and here he
[1:01:00] comes marching back he was going down
[1:01:03] with his faith laying on the word notice
[1:01:05] his faith laying on the word
[1:01:08] that he could bring it back what he had
[1:01:10] lost and here he come back with it
[1:01:12] marching the victor's marks and that's
[1:01:14] the same thing that you can do
[1:01:18] if you don't have eternal life ask
[1:01:22] god it's the greatest thing that you can
[1:01:25] ever have in life is eternal life
[1:01:28] ask god confess your sins believe on the
[1:01:31] son of god accept the baptism of the
[1:01:33] holy ghost and say god i come for it i'm
[1:01:37] here to receive it then you come back
[1:01:39] the victor's march you got it hey man
[1:01:41] just shining my the birds singing
[1:01:43] different everybody you're in love with
[1:01:45] everybody then
[1:01:48] oh some people need to have that song
[1:01:50] sung in their heart
[1:01:52] everything shining the birds singing
[1:01:54] different everybody you're in love with
[1:01:57] everybody then
[1:01:59] you remember when brother branham said
[1:02:00] hey but when you go to pray through
[1:02:02] if you come up and everybody don't look
[1:02:04] clean to you you need to go back down
[1:02:06] and pray again but when you pray through
[1:02:08] really pray through everybody around you
[1:02:11] your enemies you love them the people
[1:02:13] that hated you the people that mocked
[1:02:15] you the people that that said all kinds
[1:02:17] of evil things about you my you don't
[1:02:19] want to see nothing don't done anything
[1:02:21] to them but you love them

[1:02:42] time this season of life there or the
[1:02:44] generation of life that we're living in

[1:02:49] through life and sometimes you just need

[1:03:44] life i stood for the holy ghost i was
[1:03:48] not a participator i was not a spectator

[1:03:53] thing to win that
[1:03:56] thing it's good to have a victory every
[1:03:59] once in a while and that's what abraham
[1:04:02] was doing he was marching back with the
[1:04:05] victory
[1:04:06] [Applause]
[1:04:10] notice paragraph 73 he said then who
[1:04:13] come out to meet him
[1:04:16] then who come out to meet him
[1:04:19] you think about this
[1:04:21] you think about this how powerful your
[1:04:23] victory was
[1:04:25] how powerful your your approach and how
[1:04:28] powerful everything that you brought
[1:04:30] back
[1:04:31] but notice who came back to meet him who
[1:04:34] come out to meet him who come out to
[1:04:36] meet him melchizedek
[1:04:39] came out to meet him after he had had
[1:04:42] the word vindicated melchizedek was the
[1:04:45] one that gave him the word
[1:04:49] hallelujah
[1:04:50] it's a sure win for you the church of
[1:04:52] the living god the one that gave you the
[1:04:54] word is the one that's going to meet you
[1:04:57] the one that told you you're going to
[1:04:59] have your mom and daddy is the one
[1:05:01] that's got the word to back up what he
[1:05:03] said the one that's got your healing is
[1:05:06] the one that wrote that word the one
[1:05:08] that said he's got our protocols as the
[1:05:10] one that wrote that word he is the
[1:05:13] author and the evidence of the life in
[1:05:16] the church of the living god
[1:05:22] then he put his word his faith on the
[1:05:24] word and got the victory and returned
[1:05:25] back then he had fellowship
[1:05:29] now i want you to receive this
[1:05:32] i want you to receive this as thus saith
[1:05:34] the lord for you
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:36] now you will too
[1:05:42] now you will too look at your neighbor
[1:05:43] and say now you will too
[1:05:45] you've been out fighting for your family
[1:05:47] all week you've been up against all
[1:05:49] kinds of hell this week now you will too
[1:05:53] melchizedek has come by your way to give
[1:05:56] you a victory to give you substance to
[1:05:59] give you faith to give you overcoming
[1:06:02] power now you will too
[1:06:06] oh his word will become something new to
[1:06:08] you whenever you once get the baptism of
[1:06:11] the holy ghost oh my you can't say well
[1:06:13] i can't see you you could say you say
[1:06:15] well i can't see those things i don't
[1:06:17] believe in shouting i don't believe in
[1:06:18] speaking in tongues i don't believe in
[1:06:20] divine healing it just shows that you
[1:06:22] never got the victory that's right but
[1:06:24] one time you get the victory then you
[1:06:26] got it then you have it yes sir then you
[1:06:29] can shout
[1:06:31] you ever get the victory one good time
[1:06:34] you'll know what you're shouting about
[1:06:35] you've got to dub you
[1:06:38] you're fighting with the king of kings
[1:06:41] and the captain of the lord told that he
[1:06:43] never lost the battle and he ain't
[1:06:45] planning on losing a battle
[1:06:52] what was israel doing
[1:06:54] they were shouting before they ever got
[1:06:56] to victory
[1:06:59] they were shouting before they ever got
[1:07:01] to victory and you see some people you
[1:07:04] watch a man alive they have been through
[1:07:08] you've been through some chaos i'll just
[1:07:09] talk about everybody you've been through
[1:07:11] some chaos you've been through some
[1:07:13] storms lay out a seal flipped you upside
[1:07:16] down if you were in a car man alive
[1:07:18] you'd haven't had a roll bar if you
[1:07:19] wouldn't had a roll bar you wouldn't
[1:07:21] have made it through this week
[1:07:23] but man alive you watch them come in
[1:07:25] there on saturday how it must upset hell
[1:07:28] as the children of god begin to walk
[1:07:30] back into the house of god he'd done
[1:07:32] everything against them but there is
[1:07:34] something on the inside of a body
[1:07:39] and oh before they ever seen their
[1:07:42] victory they begin to shout
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:49] there's power in your shout
[1:07:52] there's real power in your shout
[1:07:55] on the other side of your shout is your
[1:07:57] prodigals on the other side of your
[1:07:59] shout is your healing on the other side
[1:08:01] of your shout as your family on the
[1:08:02] other side of your shout it is the
[1:08:05] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:08:08] there's something laying there
[1:08:12] now let me let me speak to you
[1:08:14] let me speak to you in the in the
[1:08:16] natural realm
[1:08:17] let me speak to you this thing now
[1:08:19] shouting is not the evidence of the holy
[1:08:21] ghost
[1:08:22] now speaking in tongues is not the
[1:08:24] evidence of the holy ghost but it is a
[1:08:26] channel
[1:08:27] it is a channel and when you begin to
[1:08:30] get in that channel you begin to open up
[1:08:32] something
[1:08:33] are you with me now let me just bring it
[1:08:35] to you when i now a man of god when i or
[1:08:37] another minister when he begins to when
[1:08:39] he begins to come and bring forth the
[1:08:41] word of life he's already in a channel
[1:08:44] he already knows what god's been dealing
[1:08:46] with him about and he begins to he
[1:08:48] begins to look at scriptures and he
[1:08:50] he'll put scriptures with this quota put
[1:08:52] scriptures with this
[1:08:54] he'll begin to move illustrations around
[1:08:57] and he moves stories around and you
[1:08:58] watch as the man of god as it becomes
[1:09:01] more than just a sermon but it becomes a
[1:09:03] reality he begins to get in a channel
[1:09:06] and then it's one of the most amazing
[1:09:08] things when a man of god begins to
[1:09:10] preach the living word you watch as
[1:09:12] somebody as they begin to get in tune
[1:09:15] with the spirit and they begin to get in
[1:09:17] the channel as the man of god begins to
[1:09:19] speak as he begins to move and he'll
[1:09:21] think man i'll put this scripture over
[1:09:23] here i'll put it over here and all of a
[1:09:24] sudden the holy spirit says speak that
[1:09:26] scripture right now and you watch
[1:09:28] somebody's life as they're just begin to
[1:09:31] feed on the word of god they're getting
[1:09:33] in a channel
[1:09:35] they're getting in a channel and you
[1:09:37] don't realize what that person's doing
[1:09:39] but they're all mad they're in a channel
[1:09:41] and if you could see them on the other
[1:09:43] side of that pipe is their victory and
[1:09:46] they're pulling on it
[1:09:49] they're pulling on it and they're just
[1:09:51] doing everything they can to get that
[1:09:53] victory out of there because they know
[1:09:58] they know if they can get that pipe open
[1:10:00] there's going to come a blessing behind
[1:10:02] it and so they begin to work on that man
[1:10:04] of god and all of a sudden that man of
[1:10:06] god takes a scripture and man the whole
[1:10:09] thing opens up and it looks like an
[1:10:11] ocean's pouring over that individual why
[1:10:14] because somebody refused laodicea to be
[1:10:17] lay on a sea of them
[1:10:20] they refused the devil to be the devil
[1:10:22] to them but they accepted god to be god
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:28] and they begin to get in a channel
[1:10:31] and man alive all of a sudden the holy
[1:10:33] spirit begins to gush out on them
[1:10:37] you remember when brother branham would
[1:10:38] teach us in the church age books
[1:10:40] i believe it's in the patmos vision hey
[1:10:42] there was a patmos
[1:10:43] he said he talks about getting in the
[1:10:45] spirit he he said he he starts he starts
[1:10:47] talking about getting in the spirit
[1:10:49] and he and he starts talking about
[1:10:51] healing he said now he said if you if
[1:10:53] you ever
[1:10:54] get in the spirit of healing you'll call
[1:10:56] on the elders you anoint yourself of all
[1:10:59] you'll pray and you'll believe it and
[1:11:01] that'll be it he said there's no other
[1:11:03] court of appeal
[1:11:05] there's no other court of appeal it's
[1:11:07] settled right there he said now many
[1:11:09] times he'll say in a different place he
[1:11:11] said many times people take the word and
[1:11:13] they'll run off with it and they're just
[1:11:15] hanging on to their emotions he said but
[1:11:17] they never got into the spirit of it he
[1:11:20] said but if you can ever get into the
[1:11:22] spirit he said don't he said begin to
[1:11:25] take the word and act on the word and
[1:11:27] you begin to move in that channel
[1:11:31] get in the spirit of it
[1:11:34] act upon the word
[1:11:36] now you've been to church all your life
[1:11:40] but start acting
[1:11:41] what if you would start getting in the
[1:11:43] spirit before you ever got church
[1:11:46] what if you begin to get in the spirit
[1:11:48] of worship before you ever entered the
[1:11:50] building
[1:11:51] you begin to act on the word and then
[1:11:54] you see the word come to fruition now
[1:11:57] now let me i think i got part of that
[1:11:59] quote here
[1:12:00] let's see here
[1:12:02] i do
[1:12:03] praise the lord i was right it was a
[1:12:05] batman's vision
[1:12:07] one
[1:12:10] i was right one time
[1:12:11] now notice he said but
[1:12:13] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[1:12:16] in the spirit of things
[1:12:18] that that that are in the world he said
[1:12:21] they go to their ball games they their
[1:12:23] sporting events and their dances they
[1:12:25] enter in the spirit of it they don't sit
[1:12:27] there like wallflowers or dried up
[1:12:29] sticks they enter right into the feel of
[1:12:31] things and they become a part of things
[1:12:34] but oh how they hate the christians for
[1:12:36] getting in the spirit of god
[1:12:38] now i know some of you think i'm reading
[1:12:40] this i know you know the the the context
[1:12:42] but i know that some people may think
[1:12:44] that i'm reading this to get you excited
[1:12:46] i want to prove you i want to prove you
[1:12:48] wrong right here he said they call us
[1:12:50] fanatics and holy rollers there is
[1:12:52] nothing they won't do to show their
[1:12:54] hatred and disapproval but ignore that
[1:12:58] you can expect it knowing where it's
[1:13:00] coming from just go on and get in the
[1:13:02] spirit of worship now notice he said our
[1:13:04] spirit is clean it is fresh it is real
[1:13:07] it is sober and serious but nonetheless
[1:13:11] it is full of the joy of the lord
[1:13:15] it's not your emotions that you're
[1:13:17] getting you excited about sure you'll
[1:13:19] get emotional sure you'll get excited
[1:13:21] when the word of god but there's a
[1:13:22] reason behind it now there's a lot of
[1:13:24] people that come to worship and they
[1:13:26] only worship because they're happy
[1:13:29] but you watch that person when they
[1:13:30] ain't happy they ain't worshiping
[1:13:33] you see because happiness and joy are
[1:13:35] polar opposite happiness depends on
[1:13:37] circumstance happiness depends if the
[1:13:40] marriage is happy happiness depends if
[1:13:42] the wife is happy happy wife happy life
[1:13:45] happiness depends on circumstances but
[1:13:48] joy doesn't look at circumstances joy
[1:13:52] looks strictly at the word of god
[1:13:55] joy says i'm happy in my soul whether i
[1:13:58] got money in a bank
[1:14:00] or i got sickness on my body i got joy
[1:14:04] i got joy
[1:14:06] well this joy that i have
[1:14:10] happiness didn't give it to me
[1:14:16] you ain't serving god just because
[1:14:17] you're happy joel osteen will make you
[1:14:19] happy he'll tell you he'll put money in
[1:14:21] your wallet if you do this if you give
[1:14:23] 99 1999 right now i'll give you these
[1:14:26] four books and my you'll be blessed but
[1:14:28] i want to tell you if you'll give your
[1:14:30] ten percent
[1:14:32] i ain't selling you no book but god will
[1:14:34] bless you coming in going out
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:41] happiness ain't built on if you got a
[1:14:43] new car if you got a
[1:14:47] some people only happy when they got a
[1:14:48] new girlfriend new boyfriend all kinds
[1:14:51] of things but the joy of the lord is our
[1:14:55] strength
[1:14:56] weeping may endure for more but joy
[1:15:00] is coming in the morning
[1:15:02] when david wrote that prophetic word he
[1:15:05] said thou will not serve the holy one to
[1:15:08] seek corruption you won't leave my soul
[1:15:10] in hell
[1:15:11] he said thou wilt show me the path of
[1:15:14] life
[1:15:17] and in thy presence
[1:15:19] is joy
[1:15:25] in thy presence
[1:15:27] is joy
[1:15:29] it's the fullness of joy
[1:15:31] notice that's where it's at
[1:15:34] well you're just reading it to get them
[1:15:36] excited all right all right
[1:15:39] if it don't get you excited something's
[1:15:41] wrong but
[1:15:43] but notice what he goes when he say to
[1:15:45] say he said the christian ought to be
[1:15:46] just as exuberant
[1:15:48] and full of the pleasure in the lord
[1:15:51] as the world is when it savors and
[1:15:54] delights in its pleasures notices
[1:15:57] both christians and the world are human
[1:16:00] both have emotions
[1:16:04] your emotions is not the evidence of
[1:16:06] life
[1:16:07] but notice he said but the difference is
[1:16:10] the christians hearts and emotions are
[1:16:13] purely on the lord of glory and his love
[1:16:17] while the world satisfies the flesh
[1:16:20] that's where the christian's heart is
[1:16:23] set on is the glory and the praises are
[1:16:26] purely on the lord
[1:16:28] and him only
[1:16:31] that's where our anchor is remember
[1:16:34] brother brown he was
[1:16:36] he he he would tell he would tell in
[1:16:38] absolute 1963 right before he goes into
[1:16:40] the seals he tell he tells about a girl
[1:16:43] that he used to go with
[1:16:44] i believe her name was norma and said he
[1:16:46] said he said he begins to tell about
[1:16:49] that little girl and she began she began
[1:16:50] to get famous and she married she
[1:16:52] married a a mechanic and a machinist and
[1:16:55] different things and her family got real
[1:16:57] popular in singing and different things
[1:16:59] and one of the children or the
[1:17:00] grandchildren
[1:17:02] had got got got got caught up by or was
[1:17:05] trying to live right for christ and got
[1:17:07] too much pressure on her and brother
[1:17:09] branham would say in the message
[1:17:11] absolutely he said she she got to a spot
[1:17:13] that she had a breakdown she got to to a
[1:17:16] spot that she had a breakdown because
[1:17:17] she was being teased for trying to live
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:20] and she had a mental breakdown and they
[1:17:22] took her to the doctor and the doctor
[1:17:24] gave her all kind of uh of shark
[1:17:26] treatments and brother barum said it
[1:17:27] actually made her worse
[1:17:29] and they was going to take his it was
[1:17:30] going to take his little girl about 15
[1:17:32] 16 years old and he said she was a real
[1:17:33] beautiful young girl and he went in
[1:17:35] there and
[1:17:36] or they were getting ready to take her
[1:17:38] to the insane institution in three days
[1:17:40] and the mother and the mother and the
[1:17:42] mother was just all excited about
[1:17:44] everything but notice what she she said
[1:17:47] these words you go listen to it she says
[1:17:49] we're not defeated you know god listens
[1:17:52] to what you're saying there's power in
[1:17:54] your words and if you if you're living a
[1:17:56] defeated life at most the time most of
[1:17:59] the time it's because of what's coming
[1:18:00] out of your mouth
[1:18:03] some people enjoy sickness because they
[1:18:05] worship that thing watch what's coming
[1:18:08] out of your mouth but notice she said
[1:18:10] we're not defeated
[1:18:12] let's call brother branham and she
[1:18:14] called brother branham he told him the
[1:18:16] circumstances said would you come up
[1:18:18] here and the doctor wouldn't let him
[1:18:19] come in so he said now he said you just
[1:18:21] tell him i'm a friend don't tell him i'm
[1:18:22] a minister and he went up there and that
[1:18:24] little girl was throwing herself around
[1:18:26] in the bed and different things and and
[1:18:28] there she was she said she said billy
[1:18:31] she said if we're at we're at our wit's
[1:18:33] in here if god doesn't do something
[1:18:36] they're going to take her up there and
[1:18:37] it'd probably be the last time that we
[1:18:39] see her and brother mariam said they
[1:18:41] didn't put no bid posts or different
[1:18:42] things on there so they wouldn't hurt so
[1:18:44] they wouldn't hurt themselves people
[1:18:45] like had in that condition he said but
[1:18:47] he said i sat down on one side of the
[1:18:49] bed and the mother was sitting on the
[1:18:50] other side and he said now don't get all
[1:18:51] excited don't get all excited and he
[1:18:53] said all of a sudden there became a
[1:18:54] vision
[1:18:55] there there's a vision come forth and he
[1:18:58] began to see that little girl and he he
[1:19:00] seen that there was a boy there and he
[1:19:03] looked back and he said he said now sis
[1:19:05] he said but does she have a boyfriend
[1:19:08] does she have a boyfriend that helps him
[1:19:09] in the singing or or different things
[1:19:12] she said absolutely describe the man to
[1:19:14] her he said well then thus saith the
[1:19:16] lord she's coming out of there
[1:19:20] let's say the lord says coming out of
[1:19:22] there and brother barum said he left the
[1:19:24] building went home and he said two hours
[1:19:27] later he said they've been trying to
[1:19:28] call me all that time he said and when
[1:19:31] they finally got a hold of me he said
[1:19:33] they gotta hold him said billy it was in
[1:19:36] 20 minutes there wasn't no change at all
[1:19:38] in her she was still in that same
[1:19:40] condition but in 20 minutes she was in
[1:19:43] her right mind again because there was a
[1:19:46] mama that was willing to hang on to thus
[1:19:49] saith the lord
[1:19:51] that vision was her absolute it was her
[1:19:54] ultimate
[1:19:56] and when you make the word of god your
[1:19:58] ultimate when you make the word your
[1:20:00] absolute it is the evidence of almighty
[1:20:04] god
[1:20:05] you're not anchoring in emotion you're
[1:20:07] not anchoring in emotions
[1:20:10] you remember me telling you about the
[1:20:11] lawyer last weekend the lawyer got so
[1:20:13] excited got so emotional but he didn't
[1:20:16] have one iota of law in it
[1:20:18] but if you can put the word where the
[1:20:20] word said it would be the word you'll
[1:20:23] line up and everything will come to pass
[1:20:28] oh is there somebody that's willing
[1:20:30] that's willing to put everything in
[1:20:32] their life on the word of god
[1:20:36] i need it for my healing i need it for
[1:20:39] my family i need it for my business i
[1:20:41] need it for my church i need it for my i
[1:20:43] need it for my lost loved ones i need
[1:20:46] this
[1:20:47] without this your loss without him let
[1:20:50] me say this without the word it's a word
[1:20:53] or nothing for me
[1:20:58] this is your last hope
[1:21:00] when you come to the last breath in your
[1:21:02] life you better have the word of god on
[1:21:04] your side
[1:21:08] one breath away from here you'll know
[1:21:10] whether this message is right or not
[1:21:14] but i choose right now
[1:21:17] as joshua said as for me and my house we
[1:21:20] will serve the lord i'm willing to stand
[1:21:23] with the lord's despise few
[1:21:37] them 30 minutes went fast
[1:21:39] no turn with me second peter 1 16.
[1:21:42] let me see if i can do a brother joel
[1:21:44] here
[1:21:45] get my parachute out
[1:21:47] god bless you brother joel
[1:21:49] ii peter 1 16 for we have not followed
[1:21:53] can you say amen
[1:21:55] cuddly device fables when we made known
[1:21:58] unto you the power and coming of our
[1:22:00] lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses
[1:22:03] of his majesty
[1:22:05] for he received from god the father
[1:22:07] honor and glory when there came such a
[1:22:10] voice to him
[1:22:11] from the excellent glory
[1:22:13] saying this is my beloved son in whom i
[1:22:16] am well pleased and this voice which
[1:22:19] came
[1:22:20] from heaven we heard when we were with
[1:22:23] him in the holy mountain
[1:22:25] verse 19 we have also i want you to say
[1:22:27] that we have also
[1:22:29] a more sure word of prophecy whereunto
[1:22:32] you do well to take ye
[1:22:34] take heed as unto a light that shineth
[1:22:37] in dark place
[1:22:38] until the day dawn and the day star
[1:22:40] arise in your hearts knowing this that
[1:22:43] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[1:22:47] private interpretation for the prophecy
[1:22:49] came not in old time by the will of man
[1:22:53] but holy men
[1:22:54] of god spake as they were moved by the
[1:22:58] holy ghost you go through the prophecies
[1:23:01] you go through the old testament and you
[1:23:02] begin to see as men of old were moved by
[1:23:06] the holy ghost
[1:23:08] to say those things but we realize that
[1:23:10] god doesn't need anybody to interpret
[1:23:13] his word he interprets his own word
[1:23:16] god identifies it by his own
[1:23:19] interpretation
[1:23:20] and we realize that his interpretation
[1:23:22] is when he brings it to pass
[1:23:25] just like in the beginning when he would
[1:23:26] say let there be
[1:23:27] light and there he vindicated the word
[1:23:30] by bringing forth the light and we
[1:23:33] realize that the manifestation of god's
[1:23:35] revealed power is the vindication we
[1:23:38] realize that it was christ and abraham
[1:23:41] it was christ and isaac it was christ
[1:23:43] and jacob it was christ in moses
[1:23:47] and all the way down through those
[1:23:48] prophets all that the prophets had
[1:23:50] foretold everything when when jesus was
[1:23:53] standing there when jesus was healing he
[1:23:56] was fulfilling scriptures
[1:23:58] when jesus was showing love he was
[1:24:01] fulfilling scriptures when jesus was
[1:24:04] laying hands on a sick he was fulfilling
[1:24:07] scriptures when he stood there and he
[1:24:10] took of the book and read isaiah 61 that
[1:24:13] the spirit of the lord has anointed me
[1:24:17] and he stood there and said this day
[1:24:20] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:24:25] jesus was the interpretation
[1:24:30] god didn't have to interpret it but
[1:24:32] jesus's life
[1:24:34] interpreted it
[1:24:37] notice
[1:24:38] notice in then jesus came and called he
[1:24:40] said you say then brother random what is
[1:24:43] the evidence what is the evidence the
[1:24:45] vindication of the word
[1:24:48] in the hour
[1:24:50] that is the evidence the vindication of
[1:24:53] the word in the hour he said they they
[1:24:55] had the bible he they had the bible he
[1:24:57] was exactly what jehovah said would
[1:24:59] happen it don't need any interpretation
[1:25:02] it interpreted there there was a priest
[1:25:05] there was all they had and everything
[1:25:07] else just so routine everything but yet
[1:25:09] they failed to see the word and he made
[1:25:12] the word live out for that age that's
[1:25:15] the evidence of the age
[1:25:18] luther had the evidence of his age
[1:25:20] wesley of his age pentecost of its age
[1:25:24] but we're in another age he said those
[1:25:27] things are good he said but it's like a
[1:25:29] baby that's got a finger and an eye and
[1:25:31] a nose but after a while he has to
[1:25:34] become a human being
[1:25:36] it's like a mother carrying a seed a
[1:25:40] baby in her womb she's got life there
[1:25:43] but she can't fellowship with that life
[1:25:46] there's a lot of people that want to say
[1:25:47] that that ain't life and it's a woman's
[1:25:49] choice to say whether that's life that's
[1:25:50] absolutely false
[1:25:52] god said that yall art fearfully and
[1:25:55] wonderfully made i knew you before you
[1:25:58] were formed in your mother's womb
[1:26:00] there's life there
[1:26:02] but you can't have fellowship with that
[1:26:04] life until it becomes a human until it
[1:26:08] comes in a body form
[1:26:12] notice he could not fellowship in luther
[1:26:15] like he is fellowshipping today he
[1:26:17] cannot fellowship with wesley like he is
[1:26:20] fellowshipping today moses couldn't
[1:26:22] preach noah's message
[1:26:24] pentecost couldn't preach our message
[1:26:27] but our message is fellowship with the
[1:26:30] headship of jesus christ
[1:26:33] i say this to you this is that that was
[1:26:37] prophesied by the prophet joel and this
[1:26:40] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:26:43] ears
[1:26:45] give the lord praise
[1:26:51] hallelujah
[1:26:53] remember brother marion would talk about
[1:26:54] that chinese laundromat coming over here
[1:26:57] how do you come over here and he
[1:26:59] when he first come over he didn't know
[1:27:00] how to write anything so
[1:27:02] he would come over here and they were
[1:27:03] great laundromat and different things
[1:27:05] but they didn't know how to write so if
[1:27:06] you take in your dirty clothes to him
[1:27:08] you take your dirty clothes in there he
[1:27:10] would give you a little slip of paper he
[1:27:12] didn't write anything down on it but he
[1:27:14] would take that slip of paper and he'd
[1:27:15] rip it down the middle and when you come
[1:27:18] back to get your belongings you had to
[1:27:20] have that slip of paper and that thing
[1:27:22] had to perfectly dovetail with with his
[1:27:25] side of things
[1:27:27] so so you could take your dirty clothes
[1:27:29] in there and you could take them in
[1:27:31] there and you could get a slip of paper
[1:27:33] but when you come back with that same
[1:27:35] slip of paper you could get your dirty
[1:27:37] clothes back clean and let me say this
[1:27:39] to you that jesus christ matched
[1:27:42] everything that was said in the old
[1:27:44] testament that was told by the prophets
[1:27:47] that he was jehovah of the old jesus
[1:27:49] christ of the new testament matched
[1:27:52] everything that was there laying there
[1:27:54] in scripture prophecy was being
[1:27:56] fulfilled again
[1:28:00] brother branham said let me say this
[1:28:01] with all respects and all sincerity and
[1:28:04] all reverence in my heart he said the
[1:28:05] message of the hour has matched every
[1:28:08] word of this hour and i'm willing to
[1:28:10] stay here say with all of my heart i
[1:28:13] stand with this message
[1:28:16] i stand with william branham i stand
[1:28:18] with jesus christ because it dovetails
[1:28:22] perfectly with the scriptures of this
[1:28:25] hour
[1:28:33] hallelujah what is it you are in the
[1:28:36] spirit
[1:28:37] you're in the spirit of it
[1:28:39] let me say let me say like this on
[1:28:41] rapture morning it will be for a people
[1:28:43] that are in the spirit of the rapture
[1:28:46] when you watch somebody when all of a
[1:28:48] sudden it comes their time it comes
[1:28:50] their time for a blessing and what are
[1:28:52] they doing they're getting in the spirit
[1:28:54] of it they're getting in the spirit if
[1:28:56] you watch somebody that's calling on god
[1:28:58] believing for a miracle they're getting
[1:29:00] in the spirit of a miracle
[1:29:03] and i want to declare to you right now
[1:29:05] that we are in bible days again and
[1:29:08] jesus christ is still healing
[1:29:11] jesus christ is still feeling jesus
[1:29:14] christ is still safe jesus christ is
[1:29:17] still delivering and this is melchizedek
[1:29:20] that is standing here doing the work
[1:29:26] what are you watching
[1:29:28] you're watching somebody greater than a
[1:29:30] man stand there
[1:29:33] remember when brother branham was
[1:29:34] standing there
[1:29:35] in johannesburg
[1:29:37] and there was a there was a boy
[1:29:40] that was crossed out and brother brown
[1:29:41] said he was hideously cross-eyed
[1:29:44] he said hideously cross-eyed
[1:29:47] and they they brought they brought him
[1:29:49] up
[1:29:52] brother baron never prayed over him
[1:29:54] he never said nothing over him
[1:29:57] but he turned
[1:29:58] he said now turn
[1:30:00] and look at the people
[1:30:02] and his eyes were completely normal
[1:30:06] he never prayed for him
[1:30:08] and there was a doctor there was a
[1:30:10] doctor that made a big stir and come up
[1:30:12] there and i believe it was mr uh brother
[1:30:15] baxter and they were trying to hold the
[1:30:17] doctor back saying now wait a minute
[1:30:18] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:30:19] minute so now i i know that boy i'm the
[1:30:22] one that brought that boy here said
[1:30:24] brother random jew hypnotized that boy
[1:30:27] he said well no i didn't hypnotize and
[1:30:29] he said you were standing closer than i
[1:30:30] was to him
[1:30:32] i didn't hypnotize him he said he said
[1:30:34] now look he said i watched that boy walk
[1:30:36] up there cross-eyed
[1:30:37] he said i watch him walk up here cross
[1:30:39] hide he said but now he's perfectly well
[1:30:42] he said what happened he said i'll tell
[1:30:44] you what happened he said that in
[1:30:46] between me and him there was a holy
[1:30:49] spirit standing there and in between
[1:30:51] being cross-eyed and being perfectly
[1:30:53] well he met the holy spirit
[1:30:56] let me say this in between this platform
[1:30:59] and your seat stands the holy spirit
[1:31:03] it's not the man of god it's the holy
[1:31:06] spirit that's doing the work it's the
[1:31:08] holy spirit that's saving it's the holy
[1:31:10] spirit that's going out on the stream
[1:31:12] and setting the captives free it's the
[1:31:15] holy spirit
[1:31:16] in between here in the pulpit
[1:31:20] what is it it's melchizedek this is that
[1:31:23] [Applause]
[1:31:28] what was it jesus's life was the
[1:31:30] interpretation of it
[1:31:32] and god is god he he'll foreordain all
[1:31:36] things
[1:31:37] and if you go and you study that word
[1:31:39] for ordained
[1:31:40] it's rendered
[1:31:42] that which is before
[1:31:44] or known
[1:31:46] before
[1:31:51] now i'm
[1:31:53] i it's been my pleasure
[1:31:55] to be the associate pastor here along
[1:31:58] with brother ron
[1:31:59] for all these years
[1:32:01] and we're we're very connected
[1:32:03] we're a connected group of people you're
[1:32:04] a mature group of people we we eat on
[1:32:06] this word we're family
[1:32:10] thank god for all the other churches in
[1:32:11] the world but i'm so thankful for gospel
[1:32:13] lighthouse
[1:32:14] but
[1:32:19] but my my point my point right here is
[1:32:22] we're family we're connected we're tight
[1:32:24] we we we we have a chain of a community
[1:32:27] man we're strong but i i personally
[1:32:30] i'm personally not involved in every
[1:32:31] single one of your lives
[1:32:33] i'm not with you on your day-to-day
[1:32:35] basis i'm not making you living right
[1:32:37] i'm not making you i'm not holding your
[1:32:38] hand i'm not putting the pacifier in
[1:32:41] when it needs to be put in i'm not
[1:32:42] pulling out when it needs to be pulled
[1:32:43] out i'm not that kind of pastor i'm not
[1:32:45] that i'm not that tight with you i don't
[1:32:47] know everything that's going on
[1:32:50] i don't know everything that's going on
[1:32:52] but here is a god that foreordained all
[1:32:56] things
[1:32:58] that he knew before
[1:33:02] he knew where you'd be sitting at
[1:33:05] and you get
[1:33:06] um so upset
[1:33:09] somebody takes your seat
[1:33:14] got another visitor i won't be sat next
[1:33:16] to mom
[1:33:19] but god
[1:33:20] is the god that knows before
[1:33:25] he's so planned out the word rendered it
[1:33:27] means to know
[1:33:29] to know before
[1:33:31] it's a father that knows all the stars
[1:33:34] in heaven and calls them by name
[1:33:36] he sees every sparrow that falls
[1:33:39] and he numbers the hairs of your head
[1:33:43] but notice he foreknew what would happen
[1:33:48] he knew what would happen in the days of
[1:33:50] abraham it was prophecy of isaac there
[1:33:53] was promises that were hanging there
[1:33:54] that were foreordained that there was
[1:33:56] going to come forth his son
[1:33:58] he knew who he would be and it would not
[1:34:00] be ishmael he there was a promise
[1:34:02] hanging there that there would be a
[1:34:03] family there would be children that
[1:34:05] would come and they would possess the
[1:34:06] very land look out on it but but notice
[1:34:10] when abraham went over there in the city
[1:34:13] of guerrer
[1:34:14] notice when the king of gurir began to
[1:34:16] look out across the kingdom and he seen
[1:34:20] a fair maiden out there he looked out
[1:34:23] upon sarah
[1:34:26] notice he took sarah he took sarah he
[1:34:29] was not just wanting another woman in
[1:34:31] his kingdom he was wanting to make her
[1:34:33] his wife
[1:34:35] notice what the king was expecting he
[1:34:38] was expecting more than just another
[1:34:40] woman in the kingdom
[1:34:41] but notice how the spirit of the lord is
[1:34:44] so watching over top of you that he
[1:34:46] knows where you're at he knows where
[1:34:48] you're going and he dealt with the king
[1:34:50] of gorier in the night season and says
[1:34:53] don't touch that woman that's an
[1:34:55] anointed woman restore the man his wife
[1:34:58] god is not willing that sarah's womb
[1:35:01] would be contaminated with the king of
[1:35:03] another kingdom
[1:35:05] but there was a king that was coming
[1:35:08] it had to come from from a restored and
[1:35:11] come for a holy lineage
[1:35:14] and god's not willing that your womb
[1:35:16] would be contaminated in your spirit
[1:35:18] contaminated in your mind
[1:35:20] battle off the enemy that keeps telling
[1:35:22] you that you're gonna deal with that
[1:35:24] torment all of your life
[1:35:28] there's too many people there's too many
[1:35:30] young people nowadays that are
[1:35:31] continuing to live in torment torment
[1:35:34] over mind battles torment over things
[1:35:36] that they've done i want to tell you i'm
[1:35:38] completely off subject
[1:35:40] i'm completely off of my text right here
[1:35:42] but i want to tell you you don't have to
[1:35:44] be tormented no more to a minute in your
[1:35:46] night seasons tormented in your spirit
[1:35:49] we realize that that's where the battle
[1:35:51] is fought but stop that battle right
[1:35:53] there by the word of the living god
[1:35:57] cast satan down
[1:36:04] let me let me finish
[1:36:06] let me finish with this thought
[1:36:09] remember when brother brandon
[1:36:11] my brother brandon was
[1:36:13] was there he said i woke up real early
[1:36:15] in the morning
[1:36:17] and he said there was a demon standing
[1:36:19] in that corner
[1:36:20] they said people think they they know
[1:36:22] what demons are he said but you run into
[1:36:24] them all headlong all day
[1:36:27] he said but there was that that demon
[1:36:29] standing there he said a hideous looking
[1:36:30] thing
[1:36:31] standing there in that corner and he
[1:36:33] said he was
[1:36:34] he was accusing me he said he looked
[1:36:36] like
[1:36:36] alley-oop look like that
[1:36:39] no i know a lot of young people don't
[1:36:40] understand what that but it's a cartoon
[1:36:42] back in the day in a newspaper they made
[1:36:44] newspaper back in the day you
[1:36:45] millenniums
[1:36:46] it was a piece of paper that you folded
[1:36:48] back and you looked at it and we only
[1:36:49] looked at the cartoons
[1:36:52] all the old people looked at the
[1:36:53] dibituary and made sure they weren't in
[1:36:55] it
[1:36:59] it was a blessed day if you weren't in
[1:37:00] it
[1:37:02] can you say amen
[1:37:06] hallelujah i'm enjoying my jesus how
[1:37:08] about you
[1:37:10] he said but there was hallelupe in that
[1:37:11] corner he said he just he said he kept
[1:37:13] accusing me and telling he said he said
[1:37:16] he tried to wake up meet and see if she
[1:37:17] seen that
[1:37:19] he said no that would scare her to death
[1:37:21] he said but there he was accusing me
[1:37:22] saying you have no power
[1:37:25] you're nothing but a bluff you have no
[1:37:26] power
[1:37:28] he said then all of a sudden he said i
[1:37:30] said satan you're an offense to me and
[1:37:32] he said he said in the name of the lord
[1:37:34] jesus christ get out of here and he said
[1:37:37] he was complete he completely was gone
[1:37:41] that's what you need to say to that
[1:37:43] tormenting spirit is satan you're an
[1:37:45] offense to me in the name of jesus
[1:37:47] christ get out of my mind get out of my
[1:37:50] family get out of my home satan you're

[1:38:00] going to be what the king says i mean
[1:38:02] not what you say of me
[1:38:04] saying your offense to me
[1:38:06] he said then all of a sudden
[1:38:08] he said there came the sweetest voice
[1:38:10] i'd ever heard
[1:38:12] and said don't you ever fear to go
[1:38:14] anywhere
[1:38:15] or do anything

[1:38:33] lord jesus christ is with you
[1:38:36] satan you're an offense

[1:39:04] that satan can't do nothing with
[1:39:07] it's the third pole
[1:39:09] and he can't and he can't impersonate it
[1:39:11] he can't touch it
[1:39:13] what you're feeding on is not the mind
[1:39:16] of william branham nor the mind of any
[1:39:17] of these ministers
