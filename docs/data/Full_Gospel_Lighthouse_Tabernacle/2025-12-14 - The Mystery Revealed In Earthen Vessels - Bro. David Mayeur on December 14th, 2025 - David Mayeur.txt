Also, Sister Terresa Delaney, Brother Jeff Breeden, Sister Wanda Hinkle, all the elderly here at the church. Thankful to have brother Matthew back in the house of the Lord. I got a note while we were serving the Lord last night just worshiping the Lord and he said he said, "Wow, wow, wow, what a service." And he said, "I danced all I could around this house." And so if you knew where he was just just the day before, you would realize how great the Lord has been to him. He said it. He said his dogs downstairs probably thought they was remodeling upstairs. So that's all right. Amen. How many has a need that you'd like to make known to the Lord today? Amen. I'm invite brother William to come take these needs before the Lord. Brother William prays you pray with him today. God bless you. Amen. Let's bow our heads in our heart. Dear gracious heavenly father, we come before you in prayer, Lord. We just want to Lord magnify your name in this place this morning. Lord, we want to thank you for all your blessings on our lives, Lord, and all the things that you give us, Lord, and how good you are to us, Lord. Truly, you've been better to us than we could be to ourselves, Lord. We just want to thank you, Lord, as we're just in this season of Christmas, Father. Lord, we just want to thank you, Father, that Lord, you refuse to be separated from us, Lord. When when the choices of humanity, Lord, separated us from you, you would not allow us to be, Lord. You had attributes in you as we heard last night. You came looking for us, Lord. And Lord, you didn't just step in, Father, Lord, just a grown body. But Lord, you came as a baby so you could experience every part of life. Lord, you came in a human body that Lord, you are the perfect son of God. And you are God in flesh. But Lord, in the frailty of that flesh, you still groan with a headache and you still experience rejection and you still experience all the things of life that we go through. so that you would know what it feels like. And Lord, you allowed yourself to fall into the hands of sinful men to be crucified. And Satan thought that he had you. But Lord, it was the greatest victory, Lord God, that humanity has ever seen when you gave your life, Lord, and the sin question was settled forever. And then they buried you and Satan surely thought it was over then. Father, within three days, oh God, you resurrected and made that beautiful statement that all power in heaven and earth belongs to you. And oh God, we come in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this morning. We give you all exaltation and all the praise that we could possibly give you. Lord, we come and our hearts is so overflowing with thanksgiving for a word that you've provided for us, oh God, where the faith that you've given us in this end time despite the challenges of life, despite the things that we go through. Lord, we want to make a confession to you this morning that we believe you, Father. Lord, we just pray that you elevate our faith, Lord. There's so many promises in your word. elevate our faith, Lord, that we can hold on and believe and watch it come to pass because your word truly never fails. Lord, we pray over every request that was read. Lord, we just pray that you go to each and every one, Lord, all the ones in the hospitals, Lord, and fighting cancers, Lord, those that are will be in surgery this week. We just pray that your hand be upon them, Father. Lord, we thank you for what you did for brother Matthew. We just pray that you just continue to give the doctors wisdom as they treat them. Father, me, you completely restore us back, Lord. May his testimony even be that it was better than before. We just thank you, Father, and we believe you for this, Lord. And we just lift up Brother Ron. Pray that you bless him, Lord. And despite the doctor's reports, we have another report, and that's what we're looking to. We're standing in faith, and that's how we're proving our faith to you is we're confessing your word and we're standing on it. Lord, we just pray for the Sailor family even now, Brother Roger. Lord, despite of where we are in health or in sickness, we still depend upon you for every breath. I just pray, oh God, that you just go to him, Lord, and just comfort him as sister and Lord, in the family. Lord, you've been so good to him, Lord. And Father God, you never fail. We just love you. We commit the rest of these requests unto you even now. We commit the service into your hands and pray that you bless Brother David. Bless them as he delivers the word. May you anoint them. Bless the word to our hearts as you do so many times. We love you. We thank you in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; This time we'll take up the morning's offering. As they're as you give, you can be seated today. We'll invite Sister Emma to come bring her special and then Sister India after directly after her. While they're taking up the offering, I sing it song you never really lived. You never really live till you known the Lord till you felt his presence. You trusted in God's word.

As brother David comes, &gt;&gt; way maker, promise keeper, light in the darkness, my God. That is who you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, that is who you are. The way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God that is you are. &gt;&gt; Is that personally for you? Is he your way maker? &gt;&gt; Can you testify it once more this morning and say you are my way maker. When there is no way, he will make a way. &gt;&gt; You are a promisekeeper. That is who you are. That is who I want to praise. You're my way maker. You're a miracle worker. &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard this morning, saints? &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all our praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. In a in such a time as this, where the presence of the Lord is, everything is possible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can we sing that one more time with all our hearts in your situation that you're dealing with this morning? this night. But he's a way maker. He's a way maker. Oh, way maker, miracle work, promise keeper, light in the darkness. My God, that is who you are. Way maker, miracle worker, promise keeper, light in the darkness. Our God, that is who you are. Can we give him a hand of praise? Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. That is who you are, my Lord and Savior. Well, good morning saints. Amen. I would have loved brother Andrew to continue singing &gt;&gt; because you know there's something about worship. There's something about worship. You know the brother the prophet talks how the two spirits spirit of God the antichrist spirit are working in the framework of the church because Satan wants to get the glory out of the church. &gt;&gt; He wants to be praised because he wants to take the place of God. But we are made to worship him. And there's something about true worshippers where Christ, he said, "These are the ones that I'm looking for." &gt;&gt; That are worshiping me in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; And God has given us the truth, the revealed word. And when a seed of God sees his name in the book, Amen. And from his heart, not just &gt;&gt; making a noise, the Bible says make a joyful noise. Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's quite a difference between just a noise and a joyful noise. Cuz when it comes from your heart, there's so much joy. There's so much thanksgiving. There's so much that comes from your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So God loves worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they went into battle, Amen. And I love the testimonies that I hear. Amen. When they went into battle, who did they put in the front? Worshippers. So brothers in the front row &gt;&gt; now that goes for the back row too &gt;&gt; cuz we're worshippers &gt;&gt; and when we start running around the prophet says I've nothing never seen anything out of order &gt;&gt; cuz when the spirit of the Lord is moving. &gt;&gt; Amen. So yeah I can have a victory dance. Amen. I can walk around the walls of Jericho. Amen. And I know those walls will become crumbling down. &gt;&gt; Amen. People are are shy, afraid or say it's my character or this that and the other. No. No. Amen. Anybody here? Everybody here has emotions. &gt;&gt; Let me look at you. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody who hasn't emotions? Come forward, please. &gt;&gt; Okay. Because everybody has emotions and God, he knows how to deal with our heart &gt;&gt; where something comes out through worship. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise this morning. The true worshippers arise. You know the prophet, he talks, Amen, that Christmas and and we don't want to put it just at a date, at a period. Christmas is all year. That's not a new doctrine. You know, I know the kids, they will come, dad, it's Christmas every day. No, but Christmas, the prophet says, is a time of worship. &gt;&gt; That's why I said Christmas should be every every day because he's worthy of our praise and our glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "The first time angels ever sang at a celebration, it was in heaven." Come on now. &gt;&gt; We know the angels came down and they were worshiped. They were singing, bringing good news, good tidings. The prophet says the first time angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven. You can look it up in Job 38. We'll come back to that in a few seconds. Amen. And he said, so God asked him, Job, where were you before I laid the foundation of the earth? When the morning stars sang together and the star the sons of God shouted for joy, where were you then, Job? You see, first time angels ever sang at a celebration was in heaven. And the first time they ever sang on earth was the shepherds to the shepherds at the birth of God. So God loves worship. &gt;&gt; Some people are afraid of worship. You know why they're afraid? Because when you truly worship God in your deepest trial, we can name all of them in the Bible. Amen. When you start worshiping for the victory, maybe you don't see it yet, maybe you don't feel it yet, but by faith, &gt;&gt; you worship the one who holds everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. Something supernatural happens that maybe your eyes don't see, but that is a reality. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I was preaching if I don't know if it was last Sunday or the Sunday before in the church. Amen. That the Hebrew boys, they were in in in fire. Fire is alive. God's fire is alive. But the power of God was there and the power was sufficient. Amen. And he is my all sufficient. He is my all and all. And the power of God was sufficient. You know what? For to even stop the smell &gt;&gt; of the fire go in their clothing. &gt;&gt; You want to talk about power? &gt;&gt; Oh, brother David, that's just the detail. No, it ain't the detail. God does everything well. &gt;&gt; The little things, the big things, he does all things well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the Hallelujah. He's worthy of our praise and we should never says the prophet. Amen. Let the spirit of revival die. &gt;&gt; I would like to have a 100% of amens there. &gt;&gt; Amen. If brother Matt back home while the spirit of God is moving, Amen. can have his victory dance. &gt;&gt; What about us? Amen. I've been in many meetings. Amen. people I am not go I'm not preaching now for streaming careful your place is at church that's what the word says &gt;&gt; but if for any situation yeah I am not going there now but I've been in meetings preaching meetings and other countries are streaming in and people the same anointing that is here in the building is there where the church in a home in a car &gt;&gt; amen people receiving their deliverance their healing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We serve a living God. &gt;&gt; So, we should never let that Amen. the the spirit of revival die. &gt;&gt; Prophet says we've got to keep in revival, constantly revived every day because Paul said he had to die daily to Christ so that Christ could live. And we must never let that revival die. So saints of God, never let the revival die. &gt;&gt; So this morning once again, I'm going to ask you preach with me, please. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So thank you very much. It's a great honor before we go into the word. Again, a privilege and honor to be standing here before the redeemed of the Lord. Amen. and thank you for everything. Your love, your hospitality. Amen. You are a blessing. Yes. &gt;&gt; This is a lighthouse. It's not just a name. &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't realize, maybe many of you here have never crossed the ocean, been to Europe, been to another country. many saints. You will meet them on the other side and say what a blessing the church has been, the ministry has been. So again, thank you for sharing. Thank you for sharing Ron Brother Andrew the ministry. Amen. So it is a blessing and and and hereby I invite you Lord willing we are going to have Easter meetings in 2026 in Switzerland. So you are all invited. Amen. &gt;&gt; All are welcome. Taste and see how the Lord is good. &gt;&gt; So, and we will have the privilege of having brother Ron. He confirmed. Amen. He's one of the speakers. So, we definitely want to keep Brother Ron in prayer. Amen. And thank you once again. So yes, we know we will need eternity together to talk about the goodness of God. How in every situation, Amen. Sometimes you go somewhere, you say, "Well, you preach this and the word of God just changed my life." Well, glory be to God. That's why we preach the word. So lives are changed. Amen. So, why don't we take our Bibles, go to the word of God, and thank you musicians. Thank you, brother Andrew, Sister Katie, for all you've done for us. My wife and Jessica, my daughter, we love you dearly. Brother Ron, sister Connie, we are family. True family. Amen. Let's take 2 Corinthians 4. 2 Corinthians 4 verse three. But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God should shine unto them. For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. For God who commanded it light to shine out of darkness had shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure treasure in an earthly earth and vessel that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. He deserves all the glory. Amen. Colossians 1 verse 25. We will start off. And here Paul is saying, "Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God. Even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. To whom God would made known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery amongst the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. So that's a mystery hid through generation, through ages, but now revealed to us. Going to look on that this morning. One more scripture in Romans 8. Sorry, we have two more scriptures. Romans 8. And here again he's saying for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint hes with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. My when I read these the these verses, Amen. There's something in my heart because God has a plan for us. Amen. I had a privilege of of I don't want to keep you standing too long, but Amen. I had a privilege of visiting Rome and and and and I went to the the prison where where Paul was imprisoned and where he wrote. I mean, it wasn't a five-star hotel. &gt;&gt; There was a little opening just there where they could feed him and there was nothing else. Sometimes they even tell a story when it was pouring down rain. The water was just coming out out of the the the ground and and so there was only stone rock everywhere. And here we read the the these verses that were pinned down anointed by God. God anointing a man. Amen. Where even Amen. Paul, he had to use a big character. &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet says. Huh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we read those verses and we Oh, we know them. We know them. &gt;&gt; While God was anointing the man of God, it was for our purpose. It was for us. &gt;&gt; That's why when I read the word of God, Amen. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time, he was suffering. &gt;&gt; He was suffering. He didn't have a fancy bed. Nice and cozy. And and I've seen it a rock. Try to sleep on that rock. Water coming out. I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. My we can be thankful saints. One more scripture. Second Timothy 2. Verse 19. Nevertheless, the foundation of God standed sure. Having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his. Thank you, Jesus. He will not lose a single one. &gt;&gt; We limit. We have limits. God is unlimited. &gt;&gt; Where we stop, his grace goes way beyond. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his, and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honor, and some to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meat for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work. May God add the blessing to the reading of his word. Let's bow our heads for the word of prayer. Our precious heavenly father, once again, Lord God, we want to thank you from the depths of our hearts. Father, you that brought us together here. And Lord God, we are united not to see a man. We are united here in the name of Jesus. Because Lord, we want to have an opp another meeting with you, another conference with you, Lord, where you speak to each and every individual, Father, and where you make yourself even more real. So, Father, we've read those verses. You are the author. And we pray now, Father, may you come down and reveal, break the bread of life to each and everyone. May you anoint our ears, Father, so that we can hear your voice speaking to us. And as I hide behind the cross, I pray, may you take full control over me, Father, to preach your word, Lord God. And may it change lives, Lord. May people receive their blessing even as we speak the word. Father Lord, bless those that those that are here. Bless those that are streaming. Father, we want to surrender to you and we want to give you all the glory. We ask these things in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated. Thank you, brother Andrew. Amen. So as a title this morning, I'd like to take the mystery revealed in vessel. Amen. So we read about how the mystery is revealed. Amen. And we're going to look at why God came in our generation, in our season, in our time to reveal that was hid through all the ages. That's why we can only but repeat it. We ought to be the happiest people in the earth. &gt;&gt; Theologians, Amen. Many people have tried to understand the depths of the word and they are a thousand miles away from the truth. And here a simple me, amen, can read the word of God and read the message and and see who I am. &gt;&gt; What it's all about, what is going on here. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet talks about how me people can read the Bible. Amen. And they they hear or read about the king of the north or they Amen. Revelation. Revelation. They scratch their head and and and there's a beast and there's powers and things like that. And here simple me can read the word of God. Amen. And a vindicated prophet coming in our generation to reveal the plan of God for us. &gt;&gt; And it couldn't have happened in another age. It couldn't have happened in the in the in the first age, second. No, it had to be at our time. &gt;&gt; Amen. How we know that Israel is God's time piece. Amen. That Israel is back in his homeland. Amen. So, we see all these nations having their eyes on this little tiny little country because God what he says in his word. Amen. He said it. He's not going to take it back. He's not going to change it. So don't take it accountable on us if preachers preach the word and it doesn't fit or suit what you want to hear. &gt;&gt; We're not here to have a social gospel. We are here to prepare a bride. We are here to be rapture ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. The time of playing is over. &gt;&gt; There will be a time where we won't be able to come anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want me to remind you and often I've quoted it and even to my own church I say it co came everything was stopped. I've heard so many people say you know we couldn't come to church and we'll never be the same. co goes and yes the first week comes oh yeah yeah we're so happy and little by little we should never let the fire the revival die &gt;&gt; amen and we have a part to play in that &gt;&gt; as the minister surrenders as the ministers lays before God seeks the will of the Lord what to preach amen the food in due season amen we have a part to Amen. To to receive the word with our worship. Amen. And to keep the fire burning. &gt;&gt; Give me oil in my lamb. Keep me burning. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Give me oil in my lamb. I pray. &gt;&gt; Why? We still can. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So we see God. He wrote, Amen. three Bibles. First one was in the heaven. Second one was in the pyramid. The third one is on earth. And everyone of them agree with one another. &gt;&gt; So we're not going into different versions. No, there's not father, son, and holy ghost. There's one God. His name is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch. What does the zodiac start off with? The virgin. What does it end with? Leo the lion. the first coming and the second coming of Christ. Amen. Then he continues. He says in blasphemous names. Notice God wrote three Bibles. The first Bible was in the sky. He repeats the zodiac. Now you know the book of Job. Amen. If you don't know the book of Job, just forget about it because Job is the one explains it. How that he looked up and he named those things in the sky. So I want to take a little moment this morning before we go. Amen. To to Revelation now. Amen. But Job he writes he pins down certain verses that can sound well that's you know it's not not some some class or some but God knows what he was writing. &gt;&gt; Job is the oldest book in the Bible. That's what the prophet says before Moses even wrote Genesis. &gt;&gt; So now Job 9, we see and it shows us how great God is. &gt;&gt; You know, so often we forget how great our God is. &gt;&gt; We are so focused on our issue, on our problem, on our trial. &gt;&gt; And Satan likes to boasts himself, makes him a big giant &gt;&gt; and he's nothing but a bluff. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that this morning the weakest of the saints can have a total victory? &gt;&gt; No matter how many giants are against you, &gt;&gt; it's but a bluff. When the prophet tells you it's but a bluff, I love it because that's a simple word that I can understand. But do we act accordingly? &gt;&gt; Do we act according to what the word of God tells us? He's but a bluff. &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham had his problem, Amen. Every time he ate, he he was vomiting up. And no, I'm going to keep on &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on eating &gt;&gt; because he's only a bluff, Satan. &gt;&gt; Think of it. That's why here, God bless brother Matt. He heard the word and he acted upon it. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how I feel, glory, he's worthy of my praise. &gt;&gt; So, we see Job nine because the God that we serve is not mighty one day and then partially or very small the next day. He's almighty. &gt;&gt; Job nine, which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble. I love to talk about how great our God is &gt;&gt; because when we speak of his greatness, our so-called big problem disappears &gt;&gt; because it's about time we talk to that so-called big mountain how big our God is. &gt;&gt; Amen. which commanded the sun and riseth not, and sealed up the stars, which alone spreadth out the heavens, and treaded upon the ways of the sea, which make it arcturous, Orion, and the playheads, and the chambers of the south, which does great things past finding out. Yeah. And wonders without numbers. &gt;&gt; Brother David, are you going to preach about the stars? Hey, where were thou when the morning stars shout? Sons and daughters shout its for joy. &gt;&gt; The playads is a conspicuous group of cl or cluster of stars in the constellation Taurus commonly spoken of as seven stars though only six are visible. That made me think because in our generation, God sent us a prophet messenger to preach the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; So it's not brother Brandham opening the seals. It's God himself through a vessel. &gt;&gt; So the first seal, everybody get second seal, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and then the opening of the seventh and there's silence. Six seal everybody can soal follow but the seven is for specific people. So here we see players six are visible seven it's not a public show but the bride will seize it. the bride will hear it. &gt;&gt; Although silence, it says in the Bible for the bride, it's not a moment of silence. It's a moment of rejoicing as she receive, as he reveals his secrets to his bride. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So who created Arcturius, Orion, plays? It was God. Thousands of stars, galaxies. Amen. And the Lord, he says, "This is the work of my hand." So why are all these things in the in the sky? Have you ever ever wondered? I know some people they study, they look and they have those how how do you call those things? Telescope. Thank you. To to to see all these stars and even today they discover new ones. &gt;&gt; They are there to worship God. Maybe you'll look differently to the sky next time when it gets dark. So in Job, God asked Job, "Gird up now thy lines in Job 38 like a man, for I will demand of thee and answer thou me." So whoever thinks he's important, you know, God said, "Okay, I'm going to ask you a few questions here. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you a few questions." For God, everything is simple. You know, &gt;&gt; God reveals himself in simplicity. Some people want to make it mysterious. Some people want to make it very complicated. Amen. Why did the angel of the Lord love that song? Only believe because that's only it takes. Only believe the word of God and all things are possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, amen. Then in verse 31, can thou bind the sweet influences of playads or lose the bands of Orion? What kind of a question is that? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What kind of a question is that? God talking to Job, his servant. &gt;&gt; Can you do that? &gt;&gt; Same as me asking you now. I'm going to put a little lower. And I'm not God, but can you have the victory? Can you have a revival? &gt;&gt; Can you be sealed? &gt;&gt; Can you be healed? &gt;&gt; We think, "Oh, that was for Job." And it's very complicated. Can thou bring forth Maserat in its season? And can thou guide Acturus with his sons? Knowest thou the ordinance of heaven? Can thou set dominion thereof in the earth? Of course I can. Can thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee? Can thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee, here we are. Who had put wisdom in the inward parts? Oh, who had given understanding to the heart? So, can you do these things, Job? I can, but you can't. God, we lose out of Amen. of focus how big our God is. Because if we really realize, because with the opening of the word, let me ask you that question. What is the opening of the word to you? Is it just a catchy phrase? Is it just something nice to hear? Oh, the seven seals are open. I believe all the seals are open. What is it to you personally? &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what it's about. God was just dealing with a servant saying, "Can you do this?" "No, no, I can't." He had to admit, "I can't, but you are great and worthy to be praised." &gt;&gt; In Amos 5, seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turn the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night, that call for waters of the sea, and poured them upon the face of the earth. The Lord is his name. Amen. And he holds everything in his hands. We can read in Revelation 10. Amen. Or in Revelation, he to belongs the seven stars which are the seven messengers in the seven church ages. Amen. And he holds these stars in his hand &gt;&gt; as he stands in the middle in the midst of the candlesticks holding these seven stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those seven messengers, he holds them. And not only them, he holds all the stars. Amen. He holds our lives in his hand. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 45 says it this way. I have made the earth and created man upon it. I even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have I commanded. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; Brother David, I knew that already. Well, you ought to be shouting the victory. &gt;&gt; Because if I am his bride, &gt;&gt; that means I have the same authority. Amen. My wife has the same authority on the check that when I sign it. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many are married here? There ought to be way more amens than that. Whether you like it or not. Just learned you people love Costco. Huh? Not only sisters, brothers, too. Well, this is way better than Costco. This is way more powerful. &gt;&gt; And the good thing is it's free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nehemiah 9 says, "Thou even thou our Lord alone. Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that's in therein, and thou preservest them all. And the host of heaven worshipeth thee." Worshipeth thee. You don't think the stars worship, huh? They do. Psalm 33 says, "By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth." Only a breath of God can create this. &gt;&gt; Think of it. That's why when he breathed upon those that were in the upper room, a mighty rushing wind came in the house and filled them all with the Holy Ghost. That's the God we serve, saints, this morning. Amen. And he's the same working for us. Amen. How important it is, saints. Amen. That we give glory to him and him alone. Not to any sorry brethren not oh we have the best church. It's good you believe it if you truly believe it. We've got the best pastor. Well glory hallelujah. You know let me say what Spurgeon said. You know some people they say hey I'm looking for a perfect church. You will never find it because the moment you find it as soon as you get in it it's not perfect anymore. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Does that deal with some issues? Glory be to God. But to think when we hear about these consolations, Amen. that God forfeit, Amen. for earth is a little dust like a little tiny grain of sand in the whole universe. Now on this little grain of sand called earth, he chose fit to choose a bride. Think of it. That's how much you are important to him. That's how much he loves us. So that's why God way from the beginning, he had a purpose. He had a plan in him were attributes that he wanted to reveal to manifest. Amen. And therefore, he chose the bride before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. He chose in him. &gt;&gt; She's a part of him. Amen. And then those names were written. Amen. Before even there was a molecule &gt;&gt; and through the ages people are grasping after the mystery of God revealed which is what Christ in you the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; But now is revealed to his saints. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. What a mighty God we serve. Amen. to realize that he thinks so much of us. Last night you heard you were his jewels. This morning you hear how important you are. But do we respond by telling him how important he is for us? &gt;&gt; That he is our all in all. We can see in Revelations 5, Amen. How John, which is a type of the bride, and you know these verses. I'm going to read them for the sake of time. Amen. But how important it is, John, he wept because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David will prevail one day. Thank you. Thank you. Some are are attentive preaching with me. The root of David hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb. It had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth, and came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sit upon the throne. So John wept &gt;&gt; because he knew, Amen. And I would be crying today. Amen. If I didn't have received an open book, a revealed word in my age, in my time, &gt;&gt; because I know I would be lost. That's what John was realizing. If no one is worthy to take the book of redemption to open the seals thereof, &gt;&gt; but here comes a bloody lamb. &gt;&gt; He alone is worthy &gt;&gt; to look upon. Amen. To take the book, to open the seals thereof. Amen, brother David. We heard it thousand times. It ought to be everything in our life. That's why the opening of the word is a true jubilee for the bride. Is a true revival. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, notice, he is not an animal. He took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. Who was it? The owner, the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand. And no angel, no angelic being, nothing else could take the place. And in this bloody lamb, it walked out and took the book out of his hand. What was it, brother? The most sublime thing in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you look up the word sublime, it's not just something nice to have. &gt;&gt; It's not just something common, &gt;&gt; right? sublime. It's the most exquisite, the most wonderful, the most glorious. Come on. And and whatever you want. But that's how important it is. If the the prophet says the most sublime thing in the scripture, an act that not an angel, nothing could do it. And the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. What is it now? It belongs to the lamb. We see in the first seal, Amen. He speaks about the fifth chapter, the breaking of the seals. Amen. And he says, Amen. last evening we found out that John looked and seen the book till the hand is still in the hands of the original owner. He says, remember how it was lost by Adam. He forfeited the book of life for the knowledge. People want some theological lessons. People want some and I know people they don't love me for that but it's still that's okay. I still love them but we don't want a seminary. &gt;&gt; A seminary will not save you. &gt;&gt; A seminary will not make you rapture ready. &gt;&gt; What will make you rapture ready is a true bornagain experience where the fire of God cleans you out. Amen. &gt;&gt; Turns you around. That's what the word of God does. Amen. What does the word do? It will bring the hearts of the children back &gt;&gt; to the hearts of the father. &gt;&gt; Turn around. Transforming power. &gt;&gt; So we see, amen, those two trees, you know, the in the garden, the tree of life is a person, the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a person. Also the prophet says in the Ephesians churches we start with the fact that there were two trees. The tree of life was Jesus. There was a perfect tree that bore perfect fruit. &gt;&gt; Now bear with me. &gt;&gt; Still early. &gt;&gt; David saw it in the Psalms and said, "It's like a tree standing by the rivers of water." Sure, the rivers, many of them of one water, many gifts, the same spirit. and he bore every fruit perfectly. Then the Romans cut him down, hung him on the man-made tree. But when he come back, he ordained on the day of Pentecost, what did he ordain? A bride tree with the spirit of himself in that tree to bear the same fruit. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. I'm talking about you now. &gt;&gt; It's a bride tree. Jesus was the bride. He was a tree. They cut him down. He was the tree of life that was in the garden of Eden. They cut him down and hung him on the Roman tree to make fun of him. What did he do? God raised him up on the third day from the dead. And today there is a bride tree. It started back there at the beginning way back at the day of Pentecost. So we have to return back to the original Pentecost. People call emotion call the fire of God to Pentecostal. The word of God, the opening of the word doesn't bring us to a Suza street. It brings us to the original Pentecost of fire. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost punch being honed out so that they can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away. that when he comes back, it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified, sanctified, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the pyramid will stand again. That's the second Bible. &gt;&gt; It will stand again. The house of God will live again. The tree of life is growing again. &gt;&gt; Where? Amen. Manifested in earthn vessels. &gt;&gt; Give me a few more moments. Because we are made of earth, &gt;&gt; dust of the earth, &gt;&gt; we see how Eve ate of that tree of knowledge. Satan came with a lie. Surely you won't die. Your eyes will be opened. You'll be like God. What a lie. &gt;&gt; They were already like God. &gt;&gt; That's the whole thing people miss. Amen. That's why Yeah. We have spiritual amnesia and God brought us back. The word brought revealed himself for us so we see our true identity. If you would have stayed behind the word, Satan, get thee behind me. &gt;&gt; They were God on the earth. &gt;&gt; God made in the likeness of man, came down and become a redeemer to us, redeem us. And now we found out that in the days past, amen, these things which was mysterious have to be open to us in the last days. Thank God it is opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God he did it. Amen. And he is the one that can reveal those seven mysteries. Amen. And how the church was redeemed. And what will be the redeeming? &gt;&gt; So you're you're you're when you take the whole word of God. Some people take little bits and pieces and make it all kinds of weird doctrines. &gt;&gt; Take the whole book. So the only one that could reveal the mysteries was Christ. Jesus Christ was God and him alone. &gt;&gt; And when the seventh seal opened, seven thunders uttered their voices. Amen. All this was revealed by the messenger of the hour. &gt;&gt; Through, let me rephrase that. Through the messenger of the hour. &gt;&gt; Because it's not by, it's not him, the prophet that revealed. It was God. Even the prophet when he saw he said if he wouldn't have come down I would have made a total mess. I would have said something wrong. &gt;&gt; So it's all hidden in the book of mystery here. It's sealed up with seven seals. That's why it is so I love the opening of the word because when you see your name in the book when you see when you realize what God has done before even you &gt;&gt; anyone breathe his first breath it was already settled &gt;&gt; are you hearing me &gt;&gt; now that doesn't mean that you say I'm done I don't have to do a thing no that No, no. Cuz if you're a true predestinated seed, you will answer to the call. &gt;&gt; What does the Bible tell us? By their fruits will you know them. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says if you want to look in the scripture, you can get over in Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jeremiah. And find out there where he was going into captivity of the land. You know, he bought his uncle's son had some property. He went through the ceiling. Amen. So here the prophet you remember when he says after the opening opening of the seals opening of the word this Bible became a new Bible. &gt;&gt; What did it mean? He could read the Bible and we can read the Bible with through the revealed word and we see Christ and his groom in all types. Here he speaks about Jeremiah. Let's go to Jeremiah. Amen. And he says, Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying Jeremiah 32, behold Hanil, the son of Shalom, thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, buy thee my field that is in Anat for right of redemption is thine to buy. That makes me think of Ruth and Boas. That makes me think of Christ and his bride. There's only one that was worthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we will go down a little. Thus say the Lord of hosts. So we see how Amen. the the the the the purchase goes on and you know even today when something is purchased you have to go Amen through legal act write things down. It's the same in the United States. I know. But what happened? Look. Amen. He says and I charge Barrick before the saying thus say the Lord of hosts the son of the the God of Israel. Take these evidences. this evidence of the purchase boats which is sealed and the evidence which is open and put them in an earthn vessel that they may continue many days. &gt;&gt; So he knew he was going to go in captivity but he said make sure my heritage &gt;&gt; is safe. &gt;&gt; Come on saints. &gt;&gt; Come on now. We're going somewhere and we're going to for a rapture. Amen. Now it may continue for many days. For thus say the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. &gt;&gt; Will there be a rapture? Oh yes, God made sure. &gt;&gt; Will there be a bride without spot on? Oh yeah, God made sure. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The prophet says when Jeremiah wrote this book, it was sealed. Amen. He was going to be gone. So he wanted to be sure that the seal, his inheritance would be kept. Amen. So he inherit his cousin's inheritance. So he had it all wrote up legally. And what did he do? What did he do with it? I love that part of where the prophet says he sealed it up, put it in an vessel so it wouldn't rot or rust. &gt;&gt; Rot is stinky. That's why God doesn't want us to be lukewarm. &gt;&gt; Makes him vomit. &gt;&gt; He wants us on fire for God. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't want us rusty in church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know I've told the story in several several churches. Amen. But I love the revelation of my grandpa. He was a bike rider, you know, a racer and and did many many miles on his bike. And and he had this revelation everything had, you know, this chain had to be welloiled. &gt;&gt; So welloiled if you went for a ride, well, your pants was just black with oil. &gt;&gt; Well, I love that revelation because I'm going to bring it to us now. &gt;&gt; Amen. The oil. We need more oil than you can think of. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is foolish virgin. There's wise virgin. Amen. And some they had oil in their lamb. The other said, "Give me some." No, it's too late now. So fill me up, Lord. Give me more. That's what this meeting and every meeting is about. So if Jeremiah didn't want his his heritage to rot or rust, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What do you think, God? These are all old types. Let me continue. &gt;&gt; Amen. He put it in an earthly vessel and put it away so it wouldn't rot or rust until him 70 years were expired. He put it in an earthly vessel. He created himself. Now he brings it his own son, Christ Jesus. And in this last day now, he's opening the seals and showing it to his church kept in an earthly vessel so it wouldn't rot or rust. &gt;&gt; We don't need church members. &gt;&gt; Brother David, who do you think you are? I'm a nobody, but I believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; And I never want to be a rotten person, &gt;&gt; nor a rusty person. &gt;&gt; I want to be so filled with the oil of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what I go through, I will be on the front line worshiping. I will be there giving glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he said that we are joint hes. &gt;&gt; So he made sure that his inheritance our inheritance that comes when somebody dies &gt;&gt; and somebody died at my stake at my place at your place so that I can inherit all things. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about money value. I'm talking about everything he has. We own everything he is. We are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So it's been kept wrapped in the vessel of the earth that was redeemed out of the earth. Come up on that Easter morning where that seal could not hold him any longer. Think of it. Think of it. Satan tried with Jesus. So certainly he will try with us. &gt;&gt; He thought he had him. Stupid devil. &gt;&gt; How many times did he think he had you? &gt;&gt; How many times even we thought he had us? &gt;&gt; But then something within me I was reading. Amen. the other day how brother Brandham going through his hardest trial was saying yes Satan came in my mind and there lays your daughter there lays your wife and when you preach you want to talk about a loving God a merciful God that doesn't even answer your prayer you pray for thousands and and God doesn't answer is that a loving God and then he says a prophet and then something way deep down in my heart said &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; hallelujah Oh yeah. Let us doubt our doubts. Amen. When we go through the fear trial, Amen. Never forget there's something inside. Amen. That is anchored in Christ. It's a part of himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. His death seal could not hold him any longer. But he broke the seals and rose up and proving himself in the last day that he is alive. He's in his church. &gt;&gt; How does he prove he's alive? &gt;&gt; He does it in his church. And I'm not going to call you church any longer. I'm going to call you bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, who was the earthly vessel? Jesus Christ. Amen. And it was written in the word. It was hid so that you couldn't even find it. That's why it's hid from the wise, the prudent, the theologians, and it's revealed to little babes like me, like us. &gt;&gt; That's why I can worship him. Amen. That doesn't need a certain degree. It doesn't need a certain intellectual coefficient. &gt;&gt; Just say, I believe it, Lord. &gt;&gt; That speaks of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And then he says, "When you get into how God opening up them seals and showing it, come right on down." You see, when you do, then you can get away from this book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can't get away from this book. &gt;&gt; Why? That's my true identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to see my identity card? I'll show you a picture. &gt;&gt; That's my head. It doesn't show my feet. &gt;&gt; Even in America, it doesn't show the feet. It doesn't give the size of your shoes. &gt;&gt; It shows your head. &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Amen. So Jeremiah said, "This scroll must be kept." Amen. And he must be kept in an earthly vessel. Oh, what a beautiful thing there is. I could take for a while. He says, "This scroll was kept in an earthly vessel. A vessel that once became flesh, glory, died, rose again, and kept in an earthly vessel and until the time of purchase." Now, we read in Revelation that the lion has prevailed. &gt;&gt; That means it's done. He has already done it. Victory is mine. Now I can tell Satan, get thee behind me cuz victory is mine. Hallelujah. We see that the seventh angel. Amen. Daniel. Amen. We can read it. He heard the voice as thunders. It was forbidden to ride. John was forbidden to ride. It was sealed. Amen. But God. Amen. the mystery of who God is and how he was made flesh and all these things should be involved at now at that time. We are a happy people &gt;&gt; and we have a very happy meal this morning. &gt;&gt; Just thought of that. Everybody knows that. Huh? We've we have a true happy meal. And I say that with all respect of course. So the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7. Amen. We heard that. Amen. What does it say? Amen. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel. So if there is a voice, there has to be a people that hear. &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord. &gt;&gt; Speak to me. &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord. Speak to me. Tell me who I am. Tell me what's the purpose in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he says, Amen. This is finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book. It finishes the entire mystery. What was that mystery? Christ in you, the hope of glory. My is that what the plan is, brother David? Yes. Because he did certain things while he was on this earth, but he couldn't do all things. &gt;&gt; He left certain things for us to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. You look into the mirror, which is the word of God, until you truly see your identity. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Yeah. Can I go on for a little while? Won't be long. So, it's supposed Amen. He says, "All the mystery of the mystery book is revealed." Amen. To the loud messenger of that age. Now, when he rose that day, he came forth. So, where was the book at? It was still in the abstract owner, God Almighty. When Satan thought he had him, &gt;&gt; said, "Now I have a right." He has no right whatsoever. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us, "He's not even in the picture." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He's not even in the picture. He's but a stump on the side of the road bringing his children to it. So God is actually using this stump to bring his people to himself. My that puts Satan back in its position, huh? &gt;&gt; Doesn't it? And John looked around. Amen. He said he wept because no man was worthy to look on and book and espec on the book and especially open the seals to reveal what was hidden hidden. The mystery was in the seven seals. And when these seven seals were open that opened up the entire Bible &gt;&gt; and it was the book of redemption. Wow. So if you want to see your name. You have to look into the book. &gt;&gt; Face the book. &gt;&gt; Not Facebook. Face the book. &gt;&gt; I know it's been said before, but it has become a reality. People spend hours on Facebook. &gt;&gt; Spend more time in facing the book, &gt;&gt; reading the book, eating the book, becoming the book. The prophet says, "Amen." And I'm saying, "A Christian, he ought to be a hallelujah from head to toes." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From head to toes. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now security. Those who he forneew, he called. Those who he called, he justified. Those who he justified has already glorified." John tells us here in Revelation that the enemy in the last days is a very religious enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. That would get amongst the people and have organizations and so forth and cults and so forth and as they have today and would deceive the very elect if it were possible &gt;&gt; and would deceive all whose names are not put on the lamb's book of lives since the very foundation of the world. Think of it. It would be so close, one word to Eve. But God made sure when he sealed that book that it wouldn't go to any owner whatsoever. He remained the owner. He put it in an vessel. So he becomes my kinsman, redeemer. And now he says, because I live, ye can live also. I have to go for a little while, but I'll send you the comforter. I'll send you the guide. He will guide you in my truth, in all truth. I am the way. I am the truth. I am the life. I will send you my life. I will send you my spirit. &gt;&gt; When was your name put on the lamb's book of life? 1900 years ago. No, sir. Before the foundation of the word. So, what is he doing? If it's these seals opening up now, just beginning to reveal the plan of redemption. Think of it. That's what is going on. &gt;&gt; When you've been redeemed, that means you've been bought back. &gt;&gt; That means I own I was owned by the same he buys me back. Is that okay? I'm not expert in English, but I understand that. &gt;&gt; So that's these seals opening up. He says how he did it. Amen. Oh, so we're at the end time. Amen. So we had fellowship with him. Think of it. I spoke how great God was. Plads, Orion, all these things. And now he brings us back to where were thou. We had fellowship with him before the foundation of the world. Okay, that makes our mind a little but it's not about the mind. It's about here. &gt;&gt; This seed can receive and say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. when the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy way back before the foundation of the world. How do we know that that wasn't at the same time that the lamb was slain that when God in his great thinking he seen us &gt;&gt; having a pity party? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; He has seen us amen shouting and rejoicing in our salvation through Jesus. And you tell me I couldn't shout. I couldn't rejoice this morning. &gt;&gt; That's what the seals. It's a jubilee. &gt;&gt; I was lost, but I have been found. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Who were those sons of God that was shouting for joy? Jesus told them that I had joy with you before the foundation of the world. And we're not creatures of time. We're creatures of eternity. &gt;&gt; I think brother Andrew said it last night talking about brother Ron, brother M. And to think what what all that Satan puts against true servant of God tries this he still stands faithful not depending on his strength but on God's strength. And let me even put it now this way. Satan, is that all what you got? Oh, brother David, it's easy to say that you're not going through it. You don't know what I'm going through. &gt;&gt; God puts trials on each and every one of us. He knows it's according to what he allows &gt;&gt; and he gives us a measure. But in the trial, he gives us the strength to go through. &gt;&gt; So, Satan is at the best. You know today people are afraid of dying and uh the prophet he says you know death is is nothing. People are afraid of it. As a true son or daughter of God the moment we breathe out a final breath. The next one we're in his presence. &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking that somebody's going to die. Please understand me because the word of God. No, no, no. But the word of God tells us that we will not die. We will tell the glory of God. Tell of the goodness of God. Amen. So I had joy with you before the foundation. Amen. And we see that Adam everything obeyed him. Amen. Adam was in God. Amen. What Adam was in God, Christ has redeemed us back to that. to even phantom think what God is telling us. That's the plan for each and every one of us in this age. Amen. So everything obeyed him. Amen. So why can't we rejoice? Because God made sure that the word would not be rotten or rusty. He put it in an earthn vessel, Jesus Christ. And now comes at the voice of the seventh messenger. When he shall be begin to sound, the mystery shall be revealed. What of what God's plan is for us to take up all the loose ends, reveal all the mysteries, and tell us there's a bride ministry. What is that bride ministry? Christ in you, the hope of glory. Can I go on for a few more moments? So, we see, Amen. In Revelation, Amen. 10:1. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head. Cloud. Amen. and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. &gt;&gt; So we see he is our head and the body is on earth. &gt;&gt; We are his body. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:22 says and had put all things under his feet and he gave him to the to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that fillth all in all. The prophet tells us headship is here now. &gt;&gt; Not will now is here. &gt;&gt; So what happened in the upper room? What was God doing? Amen. He was separating tongues of fire was separating that big pillar of fire and dividing himself among his people. &gt;&gt; Have you noticed it doesn't say and his feet as pillar singular of fire pillars of fire. The Holy Ghost, the prophet says, separated itself the day of Pentecost. God separating himself. That day you'll know that I am in the father, the father in me, and I in you, and you in me. What day? This day. &gt;&gt; That's why I ask you the question, what is the opening of the word to you? &gt;&gt; This day. This day. &gt;&gt; God was in one man, Christ Jesus. In him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now when that pillar of fire came down at Pentecost, you notice tongues of fire set upon each of them. That was God separating himself from the pillar of fire into each member of his church. God separating himself so he could be universally all over everywhere at one time. We talked about how the galaxies and all these stars and and all that is in his hand and our lives is in his hand. &gt;&gt; Never doubt that. &gt;&gt; He we we you know that song he holds the whole word in his hand. He holds my life in his hand. So God separating himself to his church. No wonder he spoke, "Wherever two or three are gathered in my name, I'll be in their midst. So if two will agree upon anything and ask, I'll give it to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let let's not miss our God-given privileges. On day of Pentecost, when this great light came in here, God divided himself. Amen. Separating himself amongst his people. Now listen, we become God's own life in us. Oh my, &gt;&gt; that is glorious. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, God dividing himself, making him sons and daughters. That's why Satan has to be under our feet. Those pillars of fire because the head, he's the head, the body is on the earth, and Satan has to be under our feet. &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. but under your feet. Amen. So, we're not a defeated people. We are an overcoming people. Amen. We have the victory in Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We can rise above every trial and temptation. Amen. Let them know, says the prophet, that they can possess the gate of the enemy because every enemy has been put under the feet of Christ. Amen. And every enemy is under your feet as long as you are in Christ because everything is under his feet. And how do we get into him? By one spirit. We are all baptized in one body, been made partakers &gt;&gt; of the same blessing, the same power. &gt;&gt; I know that's not skim milk, but it's still the truth. So we see how God had this plan and in the super sign he says if the world could only see that God and man are one. Huh? God and man are one. The super sign was the first man that could God that God could come into and all that God was he poured into Christ. And all Christ was he poured into the church. a super sign, God and man together. That was to be the super sign of the last day. When the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days, the entire Bible open book to be fulfilled in our days. A super sign. Amen. The church has got a super sign. God back in the church manifested in human flesh again. That's where I got my title. The mystery revealed manifested in a many membered body. Isn't that a wonderful love story? how God he hid all these things and he left it for us. He chose us to think that when we will sit at this wonderful table of miles cuz I'm getting ready for a wedding supper. Huh? &gt;&gt; The wedding goes on here. Huh? The union is right now. We going to go on the wedding supper and even to think of the heroes of our faith. Brother Ron, they will come say brother Ron tell me how it was in in this hard age dark age where everything Satan had was poured but everything God had &gt;&gt; was revealed to his people. Tell us, brother Rob. &gt;&gt; Oh, many things were put on you, but how you stood faithful, how God gave you strength, how you stood on every promise. I'm not lifting up brother Ron. I'm just destroying Satan. We love our our we have a favorite you know somebody in the Bible that's my favorite that's my favorite that's my favorite think of it they will come and say hey you young boys tell me how it was &gt;&gt; because we know hell is on it this let me put it this way Satan in the garden of Eden he took a bride bride out of God's Eden. He didn't. But now God is taking a bride out of Satan's Eden &gt;&gt; to prove that he is the God Almighty. &gt;&gt; He is the God Almighty. Satan, you're but a loser. You know, I don't say that just lightly to say Satan, you but no. And it ought to be for each and everyone the same. &gt;&gt; It's not just something we say even though we can go through trials and yes, but still we have the victory &gt;&gt; in Jesus. That's why I talked I started by just remembering you how great our God is. &gt;&gt; The one who holds the universe. The one even this morning maybe it was a little chilly. It was a little cold, a little slippery. That's okay. This morning the sun rose. &gt;&gt; It proved that there was a resurrection. That's why even this morning we are celebrating the resurrection &gt;&gt; and the prophet says what erection this was but what erection resurrection this is &gt;&gt; in each and every one of us the more we hear God speaking to us the more we see our true identity and we realize &gt;&gt; Satan you're but a bluff &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; hallelujah Yeah. How the word and man become one. Become one. Oh yes. That's what it's about. That's why what is going on today. It's a very important time. The prophet says we're standing to tonight, but I'm going to say this morning upon the brim and watching come to pass and unfold two great scenes. And those two great scenes are these. One of them is the ending of history. &gt;&gt; Think of it. And the other one is the ending of time. And many great men down through the ages has longed to see this hour that we're now approaching. And as we live in this glorious setting of mortal sun and the breaking of the eternal light, I do feel that we're living in one of the grandest ages. It's not make America great again. &gt;&gt; I love you. I'm not going to call you Americans, brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; But God is having the grandest time now &gt;&gt; manifesting himself an earn vessels again. proving that he is almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. And feel that we're living in the groundest age that ever man has been permitted to live because it's what? The closing out of time and the blending in of eternity. &gt;&gt; Think of it. The Bible tells us in a moment, a twinkling of an eye, I shall be changed. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells, "Amen." How Amen. I can I when he went beyond the curtain of time, I have hair. Oh, yeah. They're numbered. Think of it. One, two, three, seven million, 8 million. I don't know how many we have. God bless you, bold brothers. They're all numbered, but think how great our God is. &gt;&gt; In a twinkling of an eye. Amen. We will have a service like yesterday, like today, or no matter how many more services we will have. Amen. And all of a sudden, oh, there's our beloved one coming in, &gt;&gt; having his victory dance like you had, &gt;&gt; brother Homer. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you young kids, you you've never seen him young. &gt;&gt; You should ask a picture so you recognize him. &gt;&gt; And some will don't will not see it. They will call you crazy just like they will call you holy roll. Just like they will call you all kinds of names. &gt;&gt; I don't care &gt;&gt; because soon you know what they call going to call me? They're going to call me God. Why don't we stand? Hallelujah. Amen. So, Amen. We're living in a glorious time, saints. Amen. is the most glor sublime. Sublime. Sorry. Sublime is French. Those who are learning French, Mr. Reagan. Sublime. That's French. And the invisible union. You know, even t the the the sermons that the prophet titled for me is a subject of worship. &gt;&gt; Why cry? speak. Think of it the invisible union of the bride. The prophet tells us says, "And Jesus, he took the word. He took my place. He became me that a sinner that I might become him the word." That's why it was sealed, put in an vessel, made sure it didn't rot, it didn't rust. Do you know that the in and in in the mana was put in the ark to make sure that and it w it was kept fresh &gt;&gt; so that every generation could come and taste. Think of it. And here we are in the grandest hour, grandest time ever. Are you realizing the grandest time? &gt;&gt; We ought to act like real true sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Grand this time that he still today feeds us &gt;&gt; true mala. himself inspiring the ministers to give us food in due season. &gt;&gt; Why in due season? Because this is the grandest season &gt;&gt; where a bride is getting ready for a rapture, for a body change. And then think of it, there 144,000 Jews that are waiting. When he's done with the Gentiles, it's over. It's over. The prophet tells us some will even preach the rapture. They will keep on preaching the message and the rapture will have already be gone. So saints, may I encourage you to seize, take every opportunity, whether it's here on the internet, no matter where you may be, seize every opportunity to receive from God &gt;&gt; because you're going to need oil more than ever. &gt;&gt; And there is still oil to receive. Brother David, &gt;&gt; why do you emphasize on that? Very simple. There's wise and foolish versions. Let me be the wise one and seek more of God. Can we So the word took my place. He became me that a sinner that I might become him. The word he says, "Oh, that spiritual union of Christ and his church." Now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming the flesh manifested vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day and he adds and it's happening day by day. That's why saints of God, it's happening day by day. And when the last one will come in, rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think, I'm sorry, young guys, young brothers. Don't think we have 80 more years. I'm not prophesying here now, but I'm just seeing the signs of the end time. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us even that this age is a very short age. Seeing the signs of the time, let's run with everything that is within us. &gt;&gt; Let's seize every opportunity. Not only young people, hey, each and every one of us &gt;&gt; so we are rapture ready. He says God finishing with that walking on two feet. That's why he spoke about those pillars of fire. God walking on two feet. Come on. In you. &gt;&gt; You walk in the streets of Brutus. No matter where you're from, God walking on two feet in you. Yes. And he will make sure that his word as you become the word and the word word becomes you that it's not rotten that it's not rusty but the word is alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word my word is spirit and truth. It is alive and well. He made sure saints that nothing would be lost. That's why I love him so much. God walking two feet in you. The footstep of the righteous are ordered of God. God walking in you. For ye are written epistles read of all men. Sorry brother bringing back to you. Your pastor can go in a hospital touch even lives there. Cuz it's God walking in two feet going in there touching many hearts because he has a testimony. The word of God tells us in the upper room we have to be witnesses. That means we have a testimony. We have an experience. We have something to give. What is that something? Jesus Christ. He is alive. He is real. And he's living in you and me, walking in two feets. And if the life that is in Christ be in you, you will bear the life that Christ bore. Saints of God, I hope we will meet again. But let me put it different. The sooner the rapture comes, the better. &gt;&gt; So if that was the last one or the first time, what matters is that this word becomes you and you become that word. That you become the manifestation of God's plan. the mystery that was hidden, but now reveal Christ in you from young to old and destroying everything Satan will try. And he will try like you heard yesterday, he is greater in you than he that is completely against you. So may God richly bless you. I love you dearly with all my heart. And what a time we will have at that wedding supper. &gt;&gt; We will remember, brother David. Remember that December. Oh yeah. How God was good then. How was talking about the goodness of God. When you start counting your blessings, saints, count them one by one. You will see all the rest will disappear. We serve a mighty God. Let's pray. Dear heavenly father, father, your words been spoken, Lord. How you led it on upon my heart. The mystery of Christ in us, the hope of glory. Lord, we know that is your desire. You had a plan from before the foundation of the world. And now, Lord God, as we live in this grandest time, grandest age for the bride, Lord, we want to come to you. Say, "Here I am, Father. Do as you please, Father. Let it be according to thy word. Use me. Let me be an instrument, a vessel that you can take full control over. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let me be that vessel, Lord God, where you can reveal, manifest yourself through fully to such an extent where you can guide my footsteps. Turn left, turn right, go there. There's a need. Silver and gold have I none, but what I have, I give it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, I heard your your prophet as I was in the plane and that struck me. He was praying and there was a need and he acted according to your word. He said, "Brother, I give you your healing in the name of Jesus Christ." That's your word. Let it be according to your word. Father, may we be sensitive to your spirit, Lord God. Wherever we go, Father, Lord, may you be with us, young or old. Lord God, may you have your way in our lives. I pray God may you bless this church as it has been a lighthouse through the years. May you continue and bless it father. Bless the ministry Lord God. Bless brother Ron Lord the pastor here father. Lord as we are standing Lord uniting our faith and your word says if we can agree upon anything it is done. So Lord God, we bind every demon of hell. He has no authority. Satan, you're but a bluff. And we claim the victory in Jesus name. Lord, may you bless each and everyone in the church, every office. Lord God, bless brother Andrew. Lord, may you be with the the whole family. Lord God, may you give them wisdom and guidance in all things. As we prepare, Lord God, for this great wedding supper, continue, Lord God, to reveal your secrets to us day after day and bring in the last ones so we can go home. Father, bless your people, I pray. Bless those that are streaming, Father, around the world. Lord, you know your people. You won't miss any. So bless them in a mighty way, I pray. In Jesus Christ's name we pray and give you glory. Amen and amen. Hallelujah. What song is that? He knows my name. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you, brother Andrew. He knows your name. Can you sing that song with a true not just I always say it's not how well you can sing it. It's how sincere you can sing it to our Lord Jesus. Cuz he knows my name. He knows your name. He made sure it was sealed and at the appointed time it was opened. So that's what the prophet says. Now the members they see their names in the book as the seal has been opened. We see our name. That's why we give him glory. May God richly bless you. If you can sing Brother Andrew knows my name. Every step that I take, every move that I make, every tear that I cry. And he knows my name. When I am overwhelmed by the pain, I can't see the light of day. I know I'll be just fine. Cuz he knows my name. He counts the stars one and all. He knows how much sand is on the shore. sees every spare platform. He made the mountains and the seas. He's in control of everything of all creatures great and small. And he knows my name. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Every step that I take, every move that I make, every tear that I cry, and he knows my name. When I am overwhelmed by the pain, I can't see the light of day. I know I'll be just fine cuz he knows my name. I don't know what tomorrow may bring. I can't tell you what's in store. I don't know a lot of things. I don't have all the answers to the questions you proide. But I know whom I have believe and he knows my name. Every step that I take, every move that I make, every tear that I cry, and he knows my name. When I am overwhelmed by the pain, can't see the light of day. I know I'll be just fine when pains of death seized on my soul. Unto the Lord I cried till Jesus came and he made me whole. But I would not be. Oh no, I would not be. Well, praise God it was Jesus. Well, I would not be denied. Oh no, I would not be be denied till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be be denied. Oh no, I would not be be denied. Oh no, I would not be be denied. Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be be denied as Jacob in the days of home. I wrestle with the Lord. And it's time with a courageous when I stood upon God's word. Oh no, I would not be be denied. For no, I would not be be denied till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be be denied. Well, oh Satan said that my Lord was gone and he would not hear my prayer. Oh, but let's praise the Lord. The work it is done and Christ the Lord is here. Oh no, I would not be be denied. Oh no, I would not be denied till Jesus came and he made me whole. I would not be denied. Hallelujah. Won't you give the Lord a hand clap of praise? Amen. Amen.
