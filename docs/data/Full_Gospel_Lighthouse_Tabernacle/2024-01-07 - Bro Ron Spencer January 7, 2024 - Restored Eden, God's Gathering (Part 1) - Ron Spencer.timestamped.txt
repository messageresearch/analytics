[41:43] brother
[41:44] bcll
[41:46] amen amen are you with with me for I
[41:50] reckon that the sufferings of this
[41:52] present time are not worthy to be
[41:54] compared with the glory that shall be
[41:57] revealed in
[41:58] us for the earnest expectation of the
[42:02] creature waiteth for the
[42:04] manifestation of the sons of God this is
[42:06] written almost 2,000 years ago and here
[42:10] we
[42:12] are because the creature
[42:15] itself was made subject to vanity not
[42:19] willing but by reason of him that who
[42:23] hath subjected the same in hope because
[42:27] of the creature itself also shall be
[42:31] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[42:34] into the Glorious
[42:36] Liberty of the children of
[42:38] God now notice these words for we know
[42:41] that the whole creation granth and
[42:44] travaileth in pain together until now
[42:49] and not only they but ourselves also
[42:52] which have the first fruits of the
[42:54] spirit even we we ourselves grown within
[42:58] ourselves waiting for the adop adoption
[43:01] to wit the Redemption of our body the
[43:04] older you get the more this scripture
[43:06] stands out to
[43:08] you a't it great Revelations chapter 21
[43:12] and verse
[43:16] one and I saw a new
[43:20] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[43:24] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[43:27] away and there was no more
[43:29] sea and I saw the holy city the New
[43:33] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[43:35] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[43:39] her
[43:41] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[43:43] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[43:46] God is with men and he will be he will
[43:49] dwell with them and they shall be his
[43:50] people and God himself shall be with
[43:53] them and be their God and God shall wipe
[43:56] away all tears from their eyes and there
[43:59] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[44:02] nor crying and neither there shall be
[44:04] there any more pain for the former
[44:06] things are passed away I like that
[44:09] scripture for the former things are
[44:12] passed away maybe you have a need on
[44:14] your body that you'd like to say Lord
[44:16] would you come by and minister to me
[44:18] today I think we all feel that way Lord
[44:21] Jesus as we're standing here what a
[44:23] awesome thing that it is to be in the
[44:25] presence of the Lord and Lord now I ask
[44:28] you that you would anoint our lips and
[44:30] anoint our
[44:31] thoughts Lord as we've just had a just a
[44:35] a wave of a a storm that came by our way
[44:37] and and Lord we just ask you that you
[44:40] would just touch those that may be lost
[44:42] power Lord keep them safe on the roads
[44:45] and whomever it might be I ask you that
[44:48] you'd help us today we're in this room
[44:51] and we know that we're not alone but
[44:53] Angels stand with us and Lord your PR
[44:56] presence is with us today because of who
[44:58] we are now Lord we ask you that you
[45:01] would come and draw us just another step
[45:04] closer to you bless services that have
[45:07] gone on around the world and will go on
[45:10] May you touch us Lord as the Bride of
[45:12] Jesus Christ and Lord come quickly we
[45:14] pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[45:18] amen you may be
[45:24] seated
[45:33] amen Genesis chapter 1 kind of tells us
[45:36] and gives us some glimpses of how it was
[45:38] how the Earth was all
[45:40] made I would like to if there could be a
[45:44] replay I would like for God to allow us
[45:46] to get the opportunity to kind of take
[45:48] us and show us how it was all done am
[45:53] you know but we were made before even
[45:56] the worlds were
[45:59] made the universes was made before there
[46:03] was even a a projection of of universes
[46:07] you were in his
[46:09] mind and if you were ever there you're
[46:12] as Eternal as he is
[46:14] eternal and just as God was slain before
[46:17] the foundation of the world he was slain
[46:19] for a reason to redeem
[46:23] you so never let the devil beat you
[46:26] around a bush somewhere or another and
[46:29] tell you that you're
[46:31] worthless or tell you that you're
[46:37] nobody don't never do that listen we
[46:40] should never really have a bad day to be
[46:42] very honest with you if our names were
[46:45] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:48] before the foundational world there's
[46:50] not a president there's not an
[46:52] ambassador there's not a dignitary in
[46:54] the world that can go with with an
[46:59] eraser and erase it
[47:01] out if God thought of you before the
[47:04] foundation of the world he has never
[47:08] unthought of
[47:12] you
[47:14] Hallelujah that ought to be enough just
[47:16] say dismiss and we're going to praise
[47:18] the Lord for a week or so
[47:21] hereen now I want you to just notice as
[47:24] God begins to create brother brand
[47:25] begins to make some statements and I'm
[47:27] going to take some thoughts from Satan's
[47:29] Eden cruelty of sin the seals and future
[47:32] homes so if you want to know where this
[47:34] all comes from he said God Was So
[47:37] Satisfied as he rested from all of his
[47:41] works on the seventh day and
[47:45] hallowed this seventh day a Sabbath for
[47:50] him God Was So
[47:54] Satisfied
[47:56] that's quite a
[47:58] statement we and our Humanity are never
[48:02] satisfied because God looked it all over
[48:06] after he had been 6,000 years in molding
[48:09] it and fixing it out and making it come
[48:12] into existence and putting the mountains
[48:15] to come up and making the volcanoes and
[48:18] to push the mountains up and things that
[48:21] had taken place in the
[48:23] eruptions and fixed it in a way that he
[48:27] had and it was a beautiful place and
[48:31] there was just nothing like it the great
[48:34] paradises of
[48:36] God the great
[48:38] dinosaurs and whatever more crawling
[48:41] through it and of the great animals and
[48:43] no harm in them and I thought this was
[48:46] such an incredible sentence the great
[48:49] dinosaurs and the great animals and
[48:53] there was no harm in them
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] amen you know I don't know about your
[49:00] grandbabies or your babies but now
[49:02] there's there's those little rubber
[49:04] animals and they're dinosaurs and I
[49:06] don't know the names of
[49:08] them amen Isaac's in the building and he
[49:12] brings his dinosaurs over in my office
[49:14] and you know I've got trophies all
[49:16] through my office but the greatest
[49:17] trophies I have is their
[49:22] toys that's the greatest trophies to me
[49:24] that I have is to watch them make those
[49:27] toys come to
[49:32] life now what I'm using that for is not
[49:35] just a statement but you know it's good
[49:37] that God made the
[49:40] Earth but literally that wasn't just
[49:43] what he had on his
[49:45] mind he was going to put himself in you
[49:48] on the earth to make it come to
[49:54] life
[49:57] I'll ask Isaac and he'll go I'll say
[50:00] Isaac what is that dinosaur and he'll
[50:03] spill off a name about that
[50:06] long I can't say it after he says it and
[50:10] then another one he'll bring out I'll
[50:11] say what's that dinosaur and well he'll
[50:15] say it real quick and he go that's what
[50:18] it is and and and I'll just kind of be
[50:21] Spellbound I must not have got anything
[50:23] in school brother Doug
[50:26] and you know he'll go through all the
[50:27] dinosaurs maybe your children have all
[50:29] the same and you know and uh and and
[50:32] then we'll we'll know that you know that
[50:35] all of that was there amen and there was
[50:39] crawling on the earth brother brandom
[50:41] says that God made man in spirit for him
[50:45] first and then he made him in flesh
[50:49] man and he made him to be The Keeper of
[50:52] the Garden of Eden you know I I be
[50:55] honest with you what Adam stepped out of
[50:57] we're getting ready to step back
[51:00] into it's a great big
[51:02] circle and God is going to restore it
[51:05] all he's going to restore the Earth and
[51:07] he's going to put it back on its axis to
[51:10] be the right way
[51:14] and this Earth is going to be redeemed
[51:17] like you're going to be redeemed and the
[51:19] whole earth is groaning to be set back
[51:24] up and the volcanoes and the storms and
[51:28] all of that there's going to be a
[51:29] perfect
[51:32] day I'm G try to behave
[51:35] Amen in the day that Adam was here and
[51:38] before the
[51:39] sin there was not a
[51:44] predator there was
[51:46] no uh we talked about it this week there
[51:49] was no there was no birds of
[51:51] prey there was no Predator with the bird
[51:56] and there was no no Predator with the
[51:58] animals and there was no predator in the
[52:05] sea it was
[52:08] perfect brother BR would say the animals
[52:10] would would uh eat
[52:13] grass and they would feed and everything
[52:16] was just perfect you know you and I
[52:19] Envision line laying down with the lamb
[52:23] they can't do that now amen amen you
[52:26] can't do it now they it's just not in
[52:29] them to be able to do it now so they get
[52:31] a
[52:35] restoration they get a restoration to
[52:37] where that they never die now listen I
[52:40] don't know it all amen I don't know it
[52:44] all all I can do is go through the
[52:46] microscope of the message of the
[52:49] hour and brother Brandon was allowed to
[52:52] look back even before the foundation of
[52:54] the world and he was allowed to look in
[52:56] the Garden of
[52:59] Eden because he's a prophet Seer he's
[53:01] not just a preacher and he's not just
[53:03] projecting thoughts and and it wasn't
[53:06] brother bram's
[53:10] thoughts I I want to I just want to take
[53:13] you I just want to take you just a
[53:14] couple of thoughts here to get you kind
[53:17] of in the mind frame it's going to take
[53:19] me weeks to preach it and I and I I I'll
[53:22] just take a little bit and we'll quit
[53:23] and I'll take a little bit and we'll
[53:25] quit quit amen is that all
[53:28] right brother B says I believe that the
[53:31] great
[53:32] cheram was at the East side of the gate
[53:36] and that sword swirling back and forth
[53:39] guarding the
[53:40] gate there that entered into
[53:44] Eden the fire of the Holy Spirit fire
[53:49] guarding that
[53:51] gate and today that's what guards the
[53:54] gate
[53:56] eight I love this statement he says and
[53:59] if you're scared of the Holy Ghost Fire
[54:02] you'll never get
[54:04] in that fire the sword of God that God
[54:08] is a consuming fire watching that tree
[54:13] guarding the tree of
[54:16] life he says I can see this little Halo
[54:20] move
[54:21] over over this world which was merely a
[54:24] sin
[54:25] Frozen hanging out there like a great
[54:29] Iceberg and he moved over near the Sun
[54:32] and he began to turn it like that around
[54:35] the sun and it be to melt and big ice
[54:37] glaciers tore loose and Texas was being
[54:40] formed and ples there and as we taught
[54:43] of how the icebergs come down through
[54:46] there the best chronological can't can
[54:50] figure out that that the whole world
[54:53] after it run down through through the
[54:55] Gulf of Mexico and so forth and begin to
[54:58] burm up with water and and the whole
[55:02] world without form and void he said and
[55:05] now here in Genesis now then God moved
[55:09] and separated the Fate from the waters
[55:13] and and made the light and he created
[55:16] all
[55:19] creations and he created all creations
[55:22] and he made it and all these trees come
[55:24] from and plants and so forth what a
[55:27] beautiful setup that he had he loved it
[55:30] and it was beautiful and he thought and
[55:33] he thought that was
[55:34] fine and so he couldn't just leave it
[55:37] there in that state he had to he had to
[55:40] leave something with it and he said let
[55:42] us make
[55:44] man plural in our image and let us make
[55:49] man in our image so then God made the
[55:52] first man not three Adams but Body
[55:55] Spirit and soul and he says and so then
[55:58] God was made in the first man he was a
[56:01] spirit man and and he was something on
[56:04] that order of of God and he said the Son
[56:08] of God the logos was the first man and
[56:12] then he gave the man
[56:14] jurisdiction to lead over all the animal
[56:17] life just like the Holy Spirit leads the
[56:20] believer go here and do
[56:23] this I'm not going to get to it but I
[56:26] want you to just notice remember in some
[56:28] statements brother Brandon made he said
[56:31] he would bring the
[56:33] animals to Adam think of this job he
[56:36] would bring the animals to
[56:43] Adam and he would say I want you to name
[56:48] them and he would look at their
[56:50] character and he would look how they
[56:51] were built and he'd look at their image
[56:53] and he'd say I believe I'll call that
[56:55] one an
[56:57] elephant we still call it that today I
[57:01] believe I'll call that a a
[57:04] chimpan and we still call it that today
[57:08] now for those that believe in evolution
[57:10] and here we are 6,000 years
[57:13] later and you didn't grow an extra
[57:20] hand so God Made You In His
[57:23] Image you know it take quite a bit of
[57:26] Faith to believe in
[57:27] evolution come on to believe that this
[57:30] all started with a big
[57:34] bank but I like God's evolution of how
[57:37] God made
[57:39] it you know it it it had to be
[57:43] incredible when Jesus was 12 years old
[57:47] and he was talking to all those
[57:48] philosophers and doctors and all of
[57:50] those those men of great knowledge that
[57:54] that had built in incredible wealth and
[57:56] that had incredible libraries and they
[57:58] had studied all the way since even
[58:00] before Abraham and they had certain
[58:03] thoughts and here was a 12y old boy
[58:08] right brother BR talks about it you can
[58:10] read about it the anti Nan fathers and
[58:13] how that he confounded the greatest
[58:16] philosophers listen for those men to
[58:19] want to Bow and worship him he took them
[58:23] Way Beyond anything that they' ever
[58:27] heard now let's just talk about the
[58:30] animals and he begins to talk about the
[58:32] animals and where they come from no
[58:35] doubt the
[58:36] zoologist was blowned
[58:41] away literally blowed away but who
[58:45] better to talk about it than the god
[58:48] that made
[58:53] it amen yes
[58:56] sir so you want to talk about how the
[58:59] world was made and so you talk to a man
[59:02] and he's got all of this all of this
[59:05] knowledge the thoughts that is in the
[59:08] libraries and and no doubt it this this
[59:10] convention that they're having it's the
[59:12] best of the best and here's a 12-y old
[59:15] boy do we have a 12-y old boy in the
[59:16] building right we are Noah Noah come up
[59:20] here and stand with me just a little bit
[59:21] you looked
[59:23] theart now Noah I'm I'm going to have
[59:25] you to stand right over there so here we
[59:27] have all of these scientists and all of
[59:31] these doctors and and maybe the doctors
[59:34] has all the knowledge that they've
[59:36] garnered since Noah
[59:39] amen and so since Noah they've got all
[59:43] these libraries and you know they think
[59:46] that they know what they're talking
[59:48] about and here's a
[59:50] boy begin to explain the nervous system
[59:54] in the
[59:55] body and how a hand
[59:59] operates how a brain
[1:00:02] operates how the heart operates the
[1:00:05] veins and the arteries and the pumping
[1:00:09] of the lungs amen
[1:00:13] why he came from the place that made
[1:00:20] it now the scripture says that Jesus
[1:00:24] took upon himself no
[1:00:27] reputation now the man that makes an
[1:00:30] artificial arm he gets a reputation or a
[1:00:33] heart transplant he gets a reputation or
[1:00:36] to be able to work on the brain he gets
[1:00:39] a reputation from that reputation he
[1:00:42] builds schools or builds libraries or
[1:00:44] many people learn under
[1:00:47] him but
[1:00:50] Jesus being God in
[1:00:53] humanity took upon himself no form of
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:00] reputation so since Noah they've gained
[1:01:02] all of this knowledge and Noah stands
[1:01:05] there and goes well this
[1:01:07] is I'm sorry Jesus stands there and goes
[1:01:10] well this is how it was made come
[1:01:14] on that's
[1:01:16] right and in a couple of
[1:01:19] days Jesus has blowed their minds
[1:01:25] now let's come 2,000 years Stephen
[1:01:27] Hawkins if you could have a conference
[1:01:29] with all the scientists and
[1:01:32] send Jesus into their midst come on they
[1:01:37] would be mind
[1:01:38] blown that's
[1:01:41] right cuz there's nobody better to
[1:01:45] explain it than the one who made it
[1:01:49] that's right amen give Noah a hand
[1:02:00] so here we have a prophet a prophet's a
[1:02:05] Seer he doesn't come out of any
[1:02:07] college he doesn't come in any
[1:02:11] denominational but he meets an
[1:02:13] angel and he's gifted in a certain way
[1:02:16] that even with his
[1:02:19] Kentucky
[1:02:20] Jeffersonville
[1:02:22] language was hot and tots and amen
[1:02:27] Egyptian Knights and no such a thing and
[1:02:31] and he and he says words that blow the
[1:02:34] minds of people and yet once translated
[1:02:39] if it's in Zimbabwe or whatever language
[1:02:42] it is you would feel comfortable with
[1:02:45] this man at your
[1:02:51] table he's so humble until he's not
[1:02:54] trying to blow you
[1:02:56] away he's trying to be able to talk to a
[1:02:59] sixth grader and let that sixth grer be
[1:03:03] able to
[1:03:05] understand amen one of the greatest
[1:03:08] statements I ever heard said you can you
[1:03:10] can be so exalted in your your thoughts
[1:03:14] and be so great in your mind and try to
[1:03:17] to explain the mysteries of God but if a
[1:03:21] a six-year-old can't understand it
[1:03:23] that's right
[1:03:25] it only means that you don't know it
[1:03:27] [Music]
[1:03:35] yourself I think that's a pretty
[1:03:37] powerful
[1:03:40] statement so God had all of these
[1:03:43] animals under
[1:03:47] submission all the tree life I want I
[1:03:50] want to tell you about the place that
[1:03:52] you're getting ready to go back to amen
[1:03:55] trees that leaves never drop off
[1:04:01] of how many ladies in here like
[1:04:04] flowers oh yeah
[1:04:07] yeah
[1:04:08] flowers that a petal never drops off of
[1:04:15] Hallelujah brother B said where you been
[1:04:17] sister Gertie well I've been down by the
[1:04:20] Rose Garden for 500 years well just
[1:04:23] think about it in that realm in that
[1:04:26] realm of of
[1:04:28] Heaven you might here be so in such a
[1:04:32] hurry you can walk through the greatest
[1:04:34] Gardens of roses and if you're there an
[1:04:37] hour you feel like you're exhausted but
[1:04:39] to go in God's rose garden and spend 500
[1:04:43] years is
[1:04:46] nothing I don't think we can really
[1:04:49] fathom what we're getting ready to step
[1:04:51] back
[1:04:53] into
[1:04:56] so it's not just you that's looking for
[1:04:59] Redemption have I laid that out just
[1:05:01] well now I want to just leave that just
[1:05:04] for a moment but even in this Fallen
[1:05:07] condition God still has control of
[1:05:12] nature because when Adam fell death hit
[1:05:16] the
[1:05:17] earth and death swept over the Earth and
[1:05:20] now Adam is not working with an
[1:05:24] almost an eternal life condition of Eden
[1:05:28] but now he's working with thorns and
[1:05:30] thistles and grass that dies and ground
[1:05:33] that's hard and he's trying to raise
[1:05:36] plant life and and trying to get enough
[1:05:39] to
[1:05:40] eat and now he has fish that won't let
[1:05:43] him just grab it to eat
[1:05:45] it he's got a fish for it and now the
[1:05:49] lion that he rubbed is now his
[1:05:53] predator now now the animals that were
[1:05:57] not vicious before now is vicious were
[1:06:01] the animals that were just at peace like
[1:06:04] a rabbit now is running for
[1:06:10] cover but we're going back to a place
[1:06:14] and if I can speak to Nature today by
[1:06:16] the authority of a prophet God's going
[1:06:19] to fix that
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:25] he's going to fix that little rabbit
[1:06:27] he's going to fix
[1:06:29] [Applause]
[1:06:34] that I I think one place that we should
[1:06:36] go to as we start this
[1:06:39] series God's going to destroy the Earth
[1:06:42] because of
[1:06:44] sin he's going to destroy
[1:06:46] it now he's gonna wash
[1:06:49] it cause you've got to be baptized a
[1:06:52] sacrifice has to be washed Jesus had to
[1:06:55] be washed in the Jordan River you had to
[1:06:58] be baptized it's part of the birth
[1:07:01] process part of your birth process to
[1:07:04] coming out of the womb water has to be
[1:07:06] broke blood water has to be broke pain
[1:07:10] listen the whole earth is in pain you
[1:07:13] and I are in pain because we got a body
[1:07:16] that's we're getting ready to step
[1:07:18] into we brought brother Bill the other
[1:07:20] day and he went into a horrible
[1:07:22] situation his mind was deteriorating his
[1:07:25] body was humiliating him he he wanted to
[1:07:28] be the same man he had always been witty
[1:07:31] and he wanted to be healthy and he
[1:07:33] wanted to be a lot of different things
[1:07:35] but his body was calling for another
[1:07:38] body are you with me that's what your
[1:07:41] body's doing brother Charlie it's
[1:07:43] calling for another body your body now
[1:07:45] is testifying that you got another one
[1:07:52] coming
[1:07:58] and it's not so far away amen it's not
[1:08:02] so far away it's watching over you and
[1:08:04] if we could use it use it in a term it's
[1:08:07] your guardian angel for just now but
[1:08:10] you're going to step into
[1:08:12] it are you with
[1:08:14] me sir
[1:08:18] so he's going to wash the Earth and he's
[1:08:21] going to he's going to flood the Earth
[1:08:25] it's not just a Kitty story he's going
[1:08:27] to flood the Earth sin got
[1:08:30] so bad
[1:08:32] that's it got so ugly until God couldn't
[1:08:36] let it go
[1:08:38] on and even God repented that he made
[1:08:41] man right because in their sinful
[1:08:44] condition it didn't even give a a an
[1:08:46] image of what God was
[1:08:49] like but the scripture said that Noah
[1:08:53] found
[1:08:54] Grace in the eyes of
[1:08:59] God I'm honest with you I'm glad that
[1:09:02] this this world is is
[1:09:06] horrible we're kind of sheltered here
[1:09:08] but this world is horrible amen and and
[1:09:11] and and let me just let me just say this
[1:09:13] to you I'm glad that we have found
[1:09:16] Grace by the law of election and by this
[1:09:19] predestinated message we found Grace
[1:09:22] that this message would protect
[1:09:26] us we can live kind of on almost a
[1:09:29] vision of Heaven even in this condition
[1:09:32] we're citizens of another kingdom but we
[1:09:34] can live in this
[1:09:37] earth and live such a life that this
[1:09:40] life will allow us to be
[1:09:44] raptured we won't be destroyed in a
[1:09:46] tribulation period we won't be destroyed
[1:09:49] in all that
[1:09:52] nonsense thank you Lord L
[1:09:55] and Noah found Grace Noah was a farmer
[1:10:00] he was not an
[1:10:01] engineer he was not a ship Builder he
[1:10:04] was a
[1:10:05] farmer he was a prophet but he was a
[1:10:08] farmer and Noah be to preach because of
[1:10:11] the revelation of God God's going to
[1:10:14] destroy the Earth can you imagine the
[1:10:16] scoffers got a lot today but can you
[1:10:18] imagine the scoffers in that day it's
[1:10:21] never
[1:10:22] rained it's never rained there's never
[1:10:25] been a storm like just came through here
[1:10:27] it's never had ice it never had snows
[1:10:31] and Noah was preaching that God's going
[1:10:34] to destroy the Earth and they were in
[1:10:37] such a scientific condition until they
[1:10:40] could build pyramids that were perfect
[1:10:43] and they they could send in the
[1:10:45] sky they had all of that going on they
[1:10:48] had a greater than even Sodom was on the
[1:10:50] earth it was horrendous they worshiped
[1:10:53] they they worshiped a lot of different
[1:10:55] things and they had forgotten
[1:10:57] God they totally forgotten God and it
[1:11:01] was it was it was a horrible
[1:11:04] condition but God instructed him I want
[1:11:07] you to build a boat I want you to build
[1:11:09] an
[1:11:10] ark and God picked the worst wood that
[1:11:14] he could
[1:11:18] pick
[1:11:20] gopher and he had him to pitch it with a
[1:11:24] certain tar that's right to make it
[1:11:29] waterproof and while he's building this
[1:11:33] unfathomable Arc he's
[1:11:36] preaching and he Don't Preach 10 years
[1:11:39] 15 years 20 years he preaches 120
[1:11:42] years same message sometimes you get
[1:11:45] bored in your Humanity because they say
[1:11:48] now that the attention span of a child
[1:11:50] is about 30 seconds I can believe it
[1:11:56] I got grandbabies and I can believe that
[1:11:58] their attention span is about 30
[1:12:02] seconds they say that an advertisement
[1:12:05] that last a minute people forget the
[1:12:08] advertisement because you buy it
[1:12:10] back so if you can have a 15 second
[1:12:14] commercial people will will catch it
[1:12:17] quicker than they will a 60c
[1:12:21] commercial it's because of your
[1:12:23] attention
[1:12:25] span and I can believe it while I'm
[1:12:28] preaching
[1:12:38] sometimes so I pray that your 30 seconds
[1:12:41] will catch back up and you'll relax for
[1:12:43] a second and then you'll catch back up
[1:12:45] another 30
[1:12:52] seconds
[1:13:01] and Noah would preach and they make fun
[1:13:03] of him it's not a doubt in my mind that
[1:13:05] some some joined to to nail some of the
[1:13:07] nails or nail whatever that they did or
[1:13:10] helped Harvest and helped to do all that
[1:13:12] CU he could have never done it all by
[1:13:13] himself and so there were there were
[1:13:15] Believers for a while and then they be
[1:13:17] gone and then there was people that
[1:13:19] would hang around their Ark just in
[1:13:22] case
[1:13:24] now God's going to flood the he's going
[1:13:25] to flood and destroy the Earth as it
[1:13:29] was he's going to destroyed the Earth as
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:33] was but we need the
[1:13:38] zoo we need a zoo
[1:13:42] amen now I don't know where
[1:13:46] lice
[1:13:48] and mice I don't know where they all fit
[1:13:52] in theing kingdom of
[1:13:56] God I don't know where mosquitoes
[1:14:01] fit I don't know where Hornets
[1:14:05] fit I don't know where they fit I I
[1:14:09] maybe we'll ask one
[1:14:13] day but somewhere they fit in the order
[1:14:17] of the kingdom of
[1:14:20] animals and they have a purpose
[1:14:25] amen now when when Noah gets done
[1:14:29] something strange
[1:14:31] happens God sweeps the Earth with his
[1:14:34] Spirit Noah doesn't blow a
[1:14:38] horn he doesn't send out Messengers but
[1:14:42] animals come two by
[1:14:46] two I love that little little meme that
[1:14:49] you get you got to fight like you're the
[1:14:51] third monkey on
[1:14:59] I love
[1:15:02] it at least I got your 30 seconds
[1:15:07] there well brother Ron I don't believe
[1:15:09] in God will explain how that God in his
[1:15:15] greatness gets lizards from New Zealand
[1:15:18] and
[1:15:19] Australia to go all of those thousands
[1:15:22] of miles
[1:15:23] to get on an
[1:15:28] ark to get an animal that jumps and got
[1:15:32] a belly and got a hole in
[1:15:36] it
[1:15:39] amen it's got a papoose if we can say it
[1:15:41] like that I don't know what it's
[1:15:43] called and a baby
[1:15:48] can can ride in
[1:15:52] that come on that animal had to get on
[1:15:55] the
[1:15:56] ark somewhere there was a place for an
[1:16:00] elephant and a giraffe and you just call
[1:16:04] whatever name you got cuz I don't have
[1:16:06] in your 30
[1:16:10] seconds dogs had to get on there and
[1:16:12] cats had to get on there horses had to
[1:16:15] get on there
[1:16:19] and cuz God so loved his Animal Kingdom
[1:16:23] he has to bring them are you with me
[1:16:26] now he's not going to just leave you in
[1:16:29] a wash he's going to bring you up to a
[1:16:31] next
[1:16:33] stage he's not just going to justify you
[1:16:35] but he's going to sanctify you and he's
[1:16:37] not going to just leave you there but
[1:16:39] he's going to once he gets you washed
[1:16:41] and once he gets you cleaned out he's
[1:16:43] going to fill you with the Holy
[1:16:45] Ghost what does that have to do with
[1:16:48] animals you are an animal without the
[1:16:50] Holy Ghost amen that's
[1:16:54] amen you're capable of anything in a
[1:16:57] sinful
[1:17:00] condition good people go to prison for
[1:17:02] the rest of their lives they were good
[1:17:05] one day and a spirit got on to them and
[1:17:07] they killed or they robbed or the maned
[1:17:09] or
[1:17:12] ravished and a spirit got on them that's
[1:17:14] the reason it's important that we have
[1:17:16] the Holy
[1:17:19] Ghost the king inside of our hearts or a
[1:17:22] spirit can get on you and one day you're
[1:17:25] on fire for God the next day you hate
[1:17:27] everybody around
[1:17:32] you you don't have the Holy Ghost you
[1:17:34] can get moody and hateful and jealous
[1:17:38] and in your 30 seconds you can name all
[1:17:40] those Spirits
[1:17:43] yeah in a moment you can believe a lie
[1:17:46] in the devil he whispers something in
[1:17:48] your ear and you can be so on fire for
[1:17:52] God but if the king ain't in your heart
[1:17:55] all a
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:58] sudden you don't want to hear a pastor
[1:18:01] you don't want to hear Church you don't
[1:18:03] want all of a sudden church is repugnant
[1:18:06] and you got 52 different reasons you
[1:18:08] don't want to be a part of
[1:18:10] it what happened a spirit got on your
[1:18:16] [Applause]
[1:18:21] animal
[1:18:30] I think it's spon that said without God
[1:18:32] youd die like an
[1:18:36] animal even made a statement that a
[1:18:38] living dog is greater than the greatest
[1:18:40] King in the world in death think about
[1:18:44] that how important life is and how
[1:18:47] important if life is so important how
[1:18:50] much more important is the eternal life
[1:18:55] if I was sitting in your seat I would do
[1:18:57] everything I could to get everything out
[1:18:59] of every
[1:19:03] service cuz one day this building will
[1:19:05] be empty be cobwebs hanging in it I
[1:19:09] don't care what they do at this building
[1:19:11] once we're gone they have it they can do
[1:19:14] whatever they want to they can have a
[1:19:15] rock concert in here if they want to
[1:19:17] we're going to be
[1:19:21] gone
[1:19:28] you said brother Ron that's a that's an
[1:19:30] ugly statement what about your car come
[1:19:33] on you get rid of the car that you wash
[1:19:35] and you pamper and you love it and all
[1:19:37] of a sudden it's got 12,000 miles on it
[1:19:40] you you take it to a guy that's a that's
[1:19:42] a Salesman and he makes you feel like
[1:19:44] that you're getting the best deal in the
[1:19:47] world he's really lying to you but he's
[1:19:49] getting the best deal in the world and
[1:19:51] he makes you feel good
[1:19:53] oh yeah and he takes your car and you're
[1:19:56] a Christian and all of a sudden he sells
[1:19:58] it to a dope
[1:20:02] dealer that car has got no Redemption
[1:20:05] value in it this building is only good
[1:20:08] for us for a
[1:20:09] [Music]
[1:20:18] time and all these animals
[1:20:21] begin to come
[1:20:24] I'll never figure out because it was God
[1:20:26] that made that
[1:20:28] happen now if God could do that he could
[1:20:31] feed them while the worst flood that
[1:20:34] ever hit the earth he could feed them
[1:20:36] now you think about the quantum you're a
[1:20:39] guy that takes care of food brother Doug
[1:20:41] is phenomenal in the food field and you

[1:21:08] cheese and there's a T-bone steak right
[1:21:11] beside that macaroni and cheese and they
[1:21:12] won't touch

[1:21:39] like green
[1:21:41] salad what' you think of my salad
[1:21:44] brother Ron it was
[1:21:50] green so in case you ever invite me for
[1:21:52] supper don't don't put salad as the
[1:21:55] front thing of
[1:21:59] the God bless you Sister an
[1:22:07] mayor hallelujah it's not a sin to eat a
[1:22:11] salad CU that's part of the Earth's
[1:22:14] creation it's just not the part that I
[1:22:18] ate I was built like a b a bear brother
[1:22:22] Ram said that Adam was like a man said
[1:22:24] his toes was in the ground said he was
[1:22:26] like a tree his toes was in the ground
[1:22:28] and he said God breathed into him and
[1:22:30] gave made him a living soul and he said
[1:22:32] he did the same thing for a bear so
[1:22:34] that's must have been where I came
[1:22:36] from I am a meat
[1:22:39] [Applause]
[1:22:51] eater
[1:22:54] brother brand was walking down the
[1:22:55] street and there was a there was a
[1:22:57] sidecar that a big a big what kind of
[1:23:00] what am I need to say here it was a
[1:23:02] train
[1:23:04] flatbed help me train flatbed flat
[1:23:10] car first grader all be told me
[1:23:14] that but it wouldn't come to me some
[1:23:16] things just won't
[1:23:18] come and
[1:23:20] so maybe his
[1:23:23] for family was working and there was a
[1:23:26] there was a guy there giving a speech
[1:23:27] and he had a whale on
[1:23:29] it and had a whale on it he said you
[1:23:32] know he says we have this fish here this
[1:23:35] whale but it stomach's only about the
[1:23:37] size of a man's
[1:23:39] head well weighing thousands of pounds
[1:23:42] but it stomach is only about the size of
[1:23:44] this head a man's head and said there's
[1:23:47] a story that says that um in the
[1:23:49] scriptures that says that Jonah got
[1:23:53] swallowed and said it must have been a
[1:23:55] whale but there's no way that that story
[1:23:57] is true brother brandham spoke up how
[1:24:00] many remember Amen brother brandom spoke
[1:24:03] up and he said you're
[1:24:06] wrong kind of he must have been must
[1:24:09] have been a little bit like my
[1:24:11] daddy and he said you're
[1:24:14] wrong the scripture says that it was a
[1:24:16] great fish that's right that God created
[1:24:20] a great fish
[1:24:23] it might have only been one like it in
[1:24:25] the whole world but God created a great
[1:24:37] fish now if you don't believe in God
[1:24:39] just stay with me the next 30 seconds or
[1:24:41] the 60 seconds or a minute and a half
[1:24:44] when God created this
[1:24:46] fish he made it so that a backsliding
[1:24:50] prophet would be throw out of a boat
[1:24:52] boat and he would be at the right spot
[1:24:55] to swallow
[1:24:57] Jonah and God built him to where that he
[1:25:01] would have air on the inside of him like
[1:25:03] that would be on the earth to where that
[1:25:06] Jonah could
[1:25:11] live and would have all kind of slime to
[1:25:14] which he had ate but today he was going
[1:25:15] to eat a
[1:25:17] prophet and this Prophet would go down
[1:25:19] inside of this belly of of a well like
[1:25:23] the belly of
[1:25:25] hell like Jesus would be in hell for
[1:25:28] three days Jonah would be in because it
[1:25:31] was a prophecy it was not just an event
[1:25:33] it was a prophecy so God used nature
[1:25:38] [Applause]
[1:25:39] amen God used nature to produce the
[1:25:43] prophecy and that guy may have been
[1:25:45] thinking that that this whale was like
[1:25:48] the fish that God created God created
[1:25:51] the whale but he created that
[1:25:58] fish cuz we know the results of it when
[1:26:01] he came out of that
[1:26:03] fish he
[1:26:05] preached all through ninev to which he
[1:26:09] preached to a such a
[1:26:12] message and he was wanting in his nature
[1:26:16] he was wanting them to be destroyed but
[1:26:18] he preached such conviction until that
[1:26:21] Wicked Nation went into sackcloth and
[1:26:25] Ashes and gave their heart to
[1:26:38] God the god that said let there be light
[1:26:40] created that
[1:26:45] fish what you say well brother Ron I
[1:26:47] don't believe God can create fish you
[1:26:49] want to go on a journey with me are you
[1:26:52] enjoying this so far oh
[1:26:57] yeah Jesus was standing with his
[1:27:00] disciples and they were very
[1:27:04] discouraged they had fished all night
[1:27:07] and not caught a
[1:27:10] fish they not caught a fish Peter was
[1:27:13] not in a good
[1:27:16] mood Peter had been a fisherman and been
[1:27:19] quite good at it amen
[1:27:23] and Jesus Walks down and says have you
[1:27:26] any
[1:27:32] fish now Peter wants to give him a
[1:27:36] sermon he's upset this is the way he
[1:27:38] makes a living he's taking time
[1:27:42] out hadn't done any good whatsoever and
[1:27:45] here's the Messiah making fun of him
[1:27:48] have you have you how many fish have you
[1:27:52] you
[1:27:53] got
[1:27:55] amen he don't have nothing to show for
[1:27:58] it now he's going to he's going to
[1:28:01] show a disciple that needs to be
[1:28:04] converted am I'm in control of
[1:28:10] nature have you heard about a prophet
[1:28:12] with fleas and flies and water to
[1:28:16] blood that was me and him amen now I
[1:28:20] want to show you that's God in me
[1:28:24] amen cast your nets on the other
[1:28:30] side brother
[1:28:34] cbze can you imagine how he felt I have
[1:28:37] been in this water all night not one
[1:28:41] fish now he's asking me to take my Nets
[1:28:46] that are extremely heavy and extremely
[1:28:49] bulky and to switch it from one side of
[1:28:52] of the boat to the other side of the
[1:28:55] boat now let me ask the critic who put
[1:28:59] this fish
[1:29:03] here and how did he know that they were
[1:29:06] going to be
[1:29:09] there that's who we're dealing with is
[1:29:12] our God and if God is your partner you
[1:29:15] better have big
[1:29:20] plans
[1:29:29] Teddy you know what they did finally
[1:29:33] with some
[1:29:35] convention they throwed their Nets on
[1:29:38] the other side and being fisherman they
[1:29:42] could understand the pull of the ropes
[1:29:44] in the net and they know
[1:29:47] now within
[1:29:49] seconds we don't have a boat big
[1:29:53] enough
[1:29:55] Hall open the windows of heaven and let
[1:29:58] him pour out a blessing on you oh yeah
[1:30:01] you don't have a bank account big
[1:30:04] enough you don't have a boat big
[1:30:14] enough now listen he's God in the boat
[1:30:17] that can calm storms but he's God
[1:30:19] standing on the on the sand
[1:30:23] brother Ron that's just a coincidence
[1:30:26] really Peter was quite a fisherman he
[1:30:28] loved it if you love something you love
[1:30:30] it you don't have to be convinced your
[1:30:32] wife can be beautiful she can be all of
[1:30:35] that in a box of
[1:30:37] chocolates she might want you to come
[1:30:40] home say you if you don't get here I'm
[1:30:43] going to be very
[1:30:45] disappointed but you might sing that
[1:30:47] song I'm going to miss
[1:30:50] her
[1:30:57] y'all a bunch of carnal
[1:31:01] people Connie's looking at me like I'm
[1:31:03] going to get you home and I'm beating
[1:31:05] you with a
[1:31:07] stick God you made her help me
[1:31:12] now and Peter enjoyed the preaching he
[1:31:15] enjoyed seeing the Miracles but he had a
[1:31:17] hook in his pocket how many of you ever
[1:31:20] read that in the scriptures that Peter
[1:31:22] had a hook in his
[1:31:23] pocket it ain't
[1:31:27] there I know some hands went up but it
[1:31:29] ain't
[1:31:40] there I'm enjoying this
[1:31:43] myself but brother brandom said he
[1:31:45] always had a hook in his pocket said
[1:31:47] every time he got next to the water how
[1:31:49] do he know that how do he know Eve's
[1:31:50] hair was blun
[1:31:59] how do you know that Abraham was sitting
[1:32:00] at the at the
[1:32:02] gate if you see it you see
[1:32:06] it I learned a long time ago just just
[1:32:09] take him at his word if an angel walk
[1:32:12] with him just take him at his word I'm
[1:32:14] not going to argue with him I'm not
[1:32:16] going to fuss with him that's
[1:32:18] why God comes along and blesses us
[1:32:26] and he said you know every time they got
[1:32:27] next to next to a body of water he said
[1:32:30] he would stand there and you can go read
[1:32:32] the quotes he said he would stand there
[1:32:33] and while the preaching was going on he
[1:32:35] put put a hook in the
[1:32:38] water he enjoyed
[1:32:40] fishing I'm going miss
[1:32:50] her I don't know how much luck he had I
[1:32:52] I really don't know how much luck he had
[1:32:54] in a meeting sermons going on he's
[1:32:57] fishing I don't
[1:32:59] know but Jesus knew oh yeah and they
