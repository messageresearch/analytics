[4:11] that's done it and amen good to be in
[4:17] the house Lord in a man is good good to
[4:20] be here
[4:21] a man kind of missed brother Josh
[4:23] tonight you know brother John you're
[4:26] you're about a foot shorter than that
[4:28] guy so hey man so amen god bless you
[4:32] each and every one of you sure love you
[4:35] I'd like to speak to you tonight on the
[4:38] spark of expectation a man Romans
[4:44] chapter 8 and verse 17 and if children
[4:49] then heirs heirs of God that's quite a
[4:53] statement we could just stop right there
[4:55] and shout the rest of this evening and
[4:58] join heirs with Christ and if so be that
[5:02] we suffer with him that we may also be
[5:05] glorified together for I reckon that the
[5:08] sufferings of this present time are not
[5:10] worthy to be compared with the glory
[5:13] that which shall be revealed in us for
[5:17] the earnest expectation of the creature
[5:20] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[5:23] sons of God for the creature was made
[5:27] subject to vanity not willing buyer
[5:30] reason of him who had subjected the same
[5:33] in Hope because the creature itself also
[5:36] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[5:39] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[5:41] the children of God for we know that the
[5:45] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[5:47] in pain together until now and not only
[5:51] they but ourselves also which have the
[5:54] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[5:56] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[5:59] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[6:01] of our body for we are saved by hope but
[6:05] hope that is seen is not hope for what a
[6:09] man seeth why doth he yet hope but if we
[6:14] hope for that which we see it not then
[6:17] do we with patience wait for
[6:19] likewise the spirit also helpeth our
[6:22] infirmities for we know that what we
[6:25] should pray for as we ought but the
[6:28] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[6:31] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[6:33] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[6:37] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[6:38] he maketh intercession for his Saints
[6:41] according to the will of God our
[6:44] favorite scriptures and we know that all
[6:46] things work together for good to them
[6:48] that love God to them who are the called
[6:51] according to his purpose
[6:54] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[6:57] predestinate to be conformed to the
[6:59] image of his son that he might be the
[7:01] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[7:04] whom he did predestinate them he also
[7:06] called and whom he called them he also
[7:09] justified and whom he justified them he
[7:12] also glorified
[7:13] I'd say we have a rigged jury tonight
[7:16] what shall we then say to these things
[7:19] if God be for us who can be against us
[7:24] let's say that together tonight
[7:27] what shall we then say to these things
[7:28] if God be for us who can be against us
[7:33] amen may be of a need tonight you just
[7:35] like to raise your hand before the Lord
[7:36] let's just pray Almighty God we love you
[7:39] with all of our hearts we're thankful
[7:41] that we can come back to your house once
[7:43] again and Lord know that you're in
[7:46] control of every situation of every life
[7:48] so many are this time of year begin to
[7:51] have the little bugs and things that are
[7:53] going on in their lives we asked you to
[7:55] go to every home in every place and
[7:57] every sick boy girl mom dad grandma
[8:00] grandma - you that you touch them Lord
[8:03] the many needs that have come in we pray
[8:05] that father that you'd stretch forth
[8:07] your hand do a supernatural work now
[8:10] father we've come to your house to be
[8:12] fed tonight I asked you to annoy our
[8:15] lips bring us into the proper channel to
[8:18] where we need to be speak to us in a
[8:21] special way father
[8:22] if you speak father you'll change our
[8:25] lives and minister to us and we thank
[8:27] you for these things in Jesus Christ's
[8:29] name we pray
[8:31] a man and a man and a man you may be
[8:33] seated Saint John chapter 15 and verse 7
[8:41] said if ye abide in me these are quite
[8:43] great words if he abide in me and my
[8:46] words abide in you you shall ask what
[8:51] you will and it shall be done unto you
[8:56] Jesus himself is saying this herein is
[9:00] my father glorified that you bear much
[9:03] fruit and so shall you be my disciples
[9:08] as the father hath loved me so I have
[9:11] loved you continue ye in my love and if
[9:16] you keep my Commandments you shall abide
[9:18] in my love even as I have kept my
[9:20] father's Commandments and abide in his
[9:23] loves these things have I spoken unto
[9:26] you that my joy might remain in you that
[9:31] your joy might be full and this is my
[9:35] commandment that you love one another as
[9:38] I have loved you next statements quite
[9:43] great greater love hath no man than this
[9:47] that a man lay down his life for his
[9:50] friends
[9:51] here my friends if you do whatsoever I
[9:55] command you watch these next statements
[9:58] henceforth I call you not servants for
[10:01] the servant knoweth not what is Lord
[10:05] death but I have called you friends for
[10:08] all things that I have heard of my
[10:11] father I have made known unto you you
[10:14] have not chosen me God's going to lay
[10:17] the order out you have not chosen me but
[10:20] I have chosen you are you with me now
[10:26] that's quite a statement now you have
[10:29] not chosen me but I have chosen you and
[10:34] ordained you that you should go and
[10:37] bring forth fruit go to the work go live
[10:43] the life
[10:44] go be God in action be a living body
[10:50] living epistles read and known of all
[10:52] men if you'll remember when they were at
[10:56] one time at one spot in their lives they
[10:59] were had very different lives but after
[11:04] they met Jesus it was said about them
[11:07] these men had been with Jesus and they
[11:13] were first called Christians at Antioch
[11:18] Alleluia I'd like for my atmosphere to
[11:21] be so changed it's a great big statement
[11:27] I'd like from my atmosphere to be so
[11:29] changed sister Mary until someone would
[11:32] know me as a Christian before ever here
[11:35] in a word listen when God comes in your
[11:41] life when God comes in your life and you
[11:45] receive a real experience with God and
[11:47] every one of our experiences will be
[11:49] different many times mystical hard to
[11:52] explain to others what it was really
[11:54] like but you know that God changed your
[11:57] life because you can look back and see
[12:00] that something took place when you met
[12:03] Jesus more than a preacher more than a
[12:05] man but when you meet the voice behind
[12:09] the voice when you meet him you become
[12:15] different in your attitude your thoughts
[12:17] your desires you become a new creature
[12:21] in Christ Jesus
[12:23] [Music]
[12:25] are you with me now now I want you to
[12:31] just notice in Luke chapter 2 and verse
[12:35] 25 in verse 26 prophet begins to say but
[12:39] it was it was like it was revealed unto
[12:42] them by the Holy Ghost talking about
[12:45] Simeon that he should not see death
[12:49] until he's seeing the Lord's Christ he
[12:52] said I'm going to use the subject of
[12:54] expectation expectations are usually
[12:57] based upon faith and you can have time
[13:01] you have to have faith to have faith
[13:04] before you can expect anything and now
[13:07] many of those servants of God in the Old
[13:10] Testament says faith cometh by hearing
[13:12] hearing of the word of God I've often
[13:14] quoted it that God is obligated to his
[13:17] work he said I I like to read oh just a
[13:20] word or two of it because what I say
[13:23] will fail because I'm a man but his word
[13:31] cannot fail because it's God when God is
[13:37] caught on the scene at any time to make
[13:41] a decision and the first decision that
[13:44] God makes it has to be that same
[13:48] decision every time if he ever he'll one
[13:56] he'll heal another if he ever save one
[13:59] he'll save another remember God doesn't
[14:05] change his mind about his word
[14:07] he doesn't have a yearly conference to
[14:10] say this is what we're going to come
[14:11] under this year this is going to be the
[14:13] agenda God started his church like he
[14:16] wanted it he's going to finish his
[14:19] church life he started it are you with
[14:24] me and there's where you must solemnly
[14:27] place your faith on thus saith the Lord
[14:30] you must believe it that it's God's Word
[14:34] and that's the only hope that that you
[14:36] have the substantial hope that we have
[14:38] is on the Word of God and God be an
[14:41] infinite cannot make a mistake he's
[14:48] perfect
[14:48] therefore all of his all of his promises
[14:53] must be perfect as he is perfect are you
[14:59] with me in the middle of his promises he
[15:02] didn't have a - and he said but but on
[15:04] the basis or on the conditions or on the
[15:09] situation God's promises are a man and
[15:13] he backs his own word up in the
[15:17] beginning was the word and the Word was
[15:20] with God and the Word was God and the
[15:23] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[15:26] the word itself so therefore the Bible
[15:29] is the Word of God it is God himself I
[15:36] want to see God right there it is I want
[15:40] to hear God right there it is I want to
[15:43] know what God thinks right there it says
[15:46] that's a living book it's a book of
[15:49] action he said that's the way every seed
[15:54] of Abraham does today that's the
[15:57] born-again Christian that's the way the
[16:00] morning green Christian does today no
[16:03] matter what the world says what science
[16:05] says science just said this week but the
[16:08] RAM in the days of brother Branham is
[16:10] they had the science had three minutes
[16:13] to midnight this last week they've just
[16:16] changed that clock to 90 seconds 90
[16:21] seconds to midnight they're only
[16:24] analyzing the condition of the world and
[16:27] how treacherous and how dangerous that
[16:30] it is are you with me we know it's
[16:33] coming to an end the whole earth is
[16:35] pressing to an end but we have an
[16:38] expectation tonight
[16:41] hallelujah in the world they have
[16:50] keynote speakers that will be the
[16:52] leading speaker they're trying to spark
[16:55] an interest to an audience to prepare
[16:58] them to lead them into an agenda for a
[17:02] conference of the direction that they're
[17:05] going to go generally they'll pick a
[17:07] very inspirational powerful speaker to
[17:11] be that man maybe a young man coming on
[17:14] the scene or a young woman coming on the
[17:15] scene that's almost that's almost just
[17:18] an up-and-coming star and they push them
[17:20] in that keynote role and it tries to
[17:22] spark an audience and you think about
[17:26] that there will go 80 90 thousand people
[17:29] to a to political audience and and
[17:32] they'll spark to them and they'll begin
[17:34] to try to tell them all kinds of things
[17:36] and you know without a shadow of a doubt
[17:38] 90% of its lies they can't they can't
[17:43] make their promises
[17:44] I know I don't mean to be difficult
[17:48] there but let me just say we come to the
[17:50] Church of the Living God tonight and
[17:54] sometimes we set with the arms crossed
[17:56] our thoughts and we walk in with thee
[17:58] the things of the day and week set like
[18:01] there's no expectation for this service
[18:04] but every service has the power to be
[18:07] the greatest service you've ever said it
[18:10] in your life well Ron I'd like to kind
[18:22] of know what it was like to to have
[18:25] lived in the days of Jesus I believe
[18:28] with this quote we can kind of tap into
[18:31] that he says now they believe the word
[18:35] to be the truth so they believed that he
[18:37] would keep his promises they gathered
[18:40] themselves and waited outside the gate
[18:42] and the city that went on with their
[18:47] ritualistic and religious worshippers of
[18:49] the city unbelievers went about their
[18:52] past
[18:53] religious people was at the temple doing
[18:55] all their ceremonial worship as they
[18:57] were celebrating something that happened
[18:59] back in Egypt but the believers were on
[19:02] their toes watching for him to come
[19:05] there were many in the city who loved
[19:08] him there's no doubt many believed in
[19:10] the coming of the Messiah but they
[19:12] didn't have the Spirit of God in them to
[19:14] draw him them to him
[19:15] there's millions today that go to church
[19:18] and worship but they don't know him just
[19:21] as they didn't then and he said so will
[19:23] it be it is coming they won't see him
[19:25] there were thousands in Jerusalem that
[19:28] felt expectations and that excitement
[19:31] that was going on they never did see him
[19:33] and a sad thing to say today yet the
[19:38] scripture must be fulfilled there's
[19:41] millions of Americans that go to church
[19:44] regularly and faithful that are never
[19:47] seen him when he comes because the bride
[19:50] will be caught away like a thief and the
[19:52] night will come and he will catch the
[19:54] bride away and the rest of them won't
[19:56] even see him think of it at millions
[20:00] going to church in a ceremonial worship
[20:03] but never see him when he comes the
[20:07] elected bride
[20:08] I believe I'm preaching to them the
[20:12] elected bride will be caught away just
[20:15] as it was then that out across and
[20:19] inspiration they gathered outside the
[20:23] gate they were talking with one another
[20:24] with perfect confidence that he'd come
[20:28] they said that there was an unbeliever
[20:30] passed by why you people are gathered
[20:32] out here light you up there up there out
[20:35] there worship he said we have something
[20:38] in our hearts we're waiting for the
[20:40] Messiah oh you bunch of religious FedEx
[20:43] fanatics you might as well said why
[20:46] don't you go out there with the rest of
[20:48] them something about it when a man and
[20:50] woman is born of the Spirit of God
[20:55] they don't go with the rest of them they
[20:57] go with God they go where he goes
[21:00] they worship with his people for God is
[21:04] spirited and they that worship Him must
[21:06] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[21:08] that's the reason they wasn't with the
[21:11] rest of them and as they waited with
[21:15] long expectations after a while up
[21:18] across the hill came someone riding on a
[21:21] little white knew it was a type of he's
[21:23] coming the second time from heaven
[21:26] riding on a white horse coming over the
[21:28] hill with this little donkey little
[21:30] white donkey nobody had paid any
[21:32] attention to him but those that were
[21:34] looking for him Harlen those that were
[21:40] looking for him they cut down branches
[21:44] they ran out there screaming Hosanna to
[21:49] the son of David that comes in the name
[21:52] of the Lord their hats worth 300 and
[21:55] above measure and they were expecting
[21:58] him and all the expectations had been
[22:01] met they know the scripture said he
[22:05] would ride in Jerusalem on a mule hey
[22:09] saw him coming that's what we've done in
[22:15] this age we've recognized this coming
[22:24] well brother Ron what was a what it
[22:27] would have been like if if I'd have been
[22:30] in brother branham's me never been a
[22:35] ministry quite like this one
[22:36] oh there's been a lot of men with gifts
[22:39] and guessing and stepping out my faith
[22:42] and saying different things but never
[22:44] one that was an accurate actually even
[22:49] brother Branham would say at the end did
[22:52] he tell you exactly what was right did
[22:56] he do you believe that all your heart
[23:00] because God was borrowing of man it's
[23:03] what he wants to do with you today he
[23:05] wants to live in your life so much so
[23:08] that the world won't see you no more but
[23:11] they'll see God let's just I found this
[23:17] interesting today as I was looking and
[23:20] this kind of just there's something just
[23:22] pop out diggin and he's kind of almost
[23:25] having a conversation as he's having a
[23:28] prayer it's how do you do lady you speak

[24:38] the scriptures about the woman at the
[24:40] well we're gonna read the scriptures
[24:44] about the woman and well and see Jesus
[24:45] operating there he with me go call your
[24:51] husband I don't have any you've said
[24:55] right listen she was a woman reality
[25:00] she's woman a reality she'd hurt a lot
[25:03] of preachers she'd met a lot of men but
[25:06] this man had out water that she'd never
[25:09] thirst again and she was a predestinated
[25:13] seed sitting in a very bad situation
[25:15] others couldn't come to the well when
[25:17] she came to the well he said rot but
[25:21] you've had five husbands and the one
[25:24] you're living with he's not your husband
[25:28] and then she begin to get religious with
[25:32] him and then he had never declared who
[25:35] he was to all of the preachers in the
[25:38] synagogue's but to a predestinate his
[25:41] seed that needed to see exactly who he
[25:47] was and it was more than just see who he
[25:50] was but she had to see who she was
[25:55] are you with me
[26:01] listen tonight under our part of the
[26:04] spark of our expectation you must see
[26:07] more than just who he is but that
[26:12] revelation must be struck in your heart
[26:15] to come to life of what God deposited on
[26:20] the inside of your life it's a very good
[26:31] faith for a sinner and you quit the
[26:34] Catholic Church that's right and then
[26:37] you started going to a Pentecostal
[26:39] Church but you didn't join it and you've
[26:44] been back to that church you haven't
[26:47] been back to that church for about a
[26:49] year you don't know what to do this come
[26:55] upon your baby that you might serve the
[26:58] Lord
[27:02] now what's God watching over there seed
[27:05] this came on your baby that you might
[27:13] serve the Lord you remember in the tenth
[27:17] meeting in South Carolina that little
[27:19] baby was healed and that baby I had it
[27:22] baby in my hands and and that baby I
[27:25] prayed for that baby and and they begin
[27:27] to jump up and it ran all across the
[27:29] audience about 1100 people watching that
[27:32] event took place Andrew was standing
[27:33] right beside of my heart my side and he
[27:36] watched it all happen and that baby is
[27:38] just running everywhere and then the
[27:41] Lord spoke to me that girl that has
[27:45] brought this baby here she's from
[27:47] Florida and the baby is why she was here
[27:51] but the greater need
[27:56] and I told her the greater need is you
[27:59] need Jesus Christ in your life and she
[28:02] was a pop music star and that night she
[28:07] gave her heart to Jesus Christ sure
[28:12] there was a physical miracle that we
[28:14] could rejoice backwards and flowers and
[28:16] scream up and down and that tent came
[28:19] alive it just had a life on the inside
[28:22] of it but the greater miracle the
[28:27] greater miracle was that girl ignited to
[28:34] life she was thirsty in trying to fill
[28:38] it in a lot of different directions with
[28:40] the gift that was in her life but God
[28:42] had more plans
[28:45] I don't know preach right there for a
[28:48] while somebody's young preachers can
[28:57] take it and do something with it now go
[29:06] and be born again of the Spirit I'll
[29:10] bless the baby I thought about that I
[29:19] read that quote I thought about that
[29:21] brother Ram says a statement that she'd
[29:23] be she'd be familiar with being a former
[29:27] Catholic she'd be familiar with I'll
[29:30] bless the baby that wasn't brother
[29:36] branham's to do well brother branham is
[29:38] not the one that told her all of those
[29:39] events
[29:44] so it wasn't brother branham talking it
[29:48] was God talking just a moment I sent

[32:10] with all your heart Alleluia
[32:15] you know that's kind of what happens
[32:17] here we can look back 40 or 50 years ago
[32:22] but that's what happens here we're a
[32:25] birthing center where the message is not
[32:29] just on paper back or in the computer
[32:31] form or in digital format now or even
[32:34] even in voice but that message lives
[32:38] there's thousands of lives of voices
[32:42] wherever you're living that now God's
[32:44] taking this message that was in print
[32:47] now in in digital format now it becomes
[32:51] and live lives producing kind aftercon
[32:57] abroad on the earth preparing overcoming
[33:02] Laodicea having victory day by day by
[33:06] day by day even in almost almost
[33:09] sometimes like speaking to a mountain
[33:12] when you speak to it the first grain of
[33:15] sand rolls over you may not see it and
[33:18] that mountain may be there a while but
[33:20] you just keep speaking to it you just
[33:25] keep speaking to that mountain and that
[33:27] mountains gotta move by what authority
[33:31] if you bodied me and my words abide in
[33:34] you that same Abrahamic faith that same
[33:38] apostille power faith hallelujah that's
[33:43] what we're resting on tonight now as
[33:47] long as it's a dead letter and we look
[33:49] at as a historical form or back in the
[33:52] days if you all have been here you're
[33:54] only living in the glare of another day
[33:58] our grandma's Goddard ran post Gadar or
[34:02] another God all brother runs but the
[34:04] great meetings are behind that's your
[34:07] expectation it shows that your
[34:10] expectation has not been sparked oh
[34:14] hallelujah
[34:16] oh we've we salmon eyes the car we
[34:20] polish the car and we've got the car
[34:23] with all of its all of its powerful mood
[34:25] urn it's a beautiful car we enjoy the
[34:29] car and we enjoy the message but it
[34:32] needs some gasoline and it needs a spark
[34:35] to it to make it go down the road what
[34:39] we needs an old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[34:41] revival in our life to bring the word to
[34:44] life
[34:46] that'll be more than some mechanical
[34:49] word now in Hollywood they'll have a
[35:05] script writers maybe they'll take a
[35:07] historical figure maybe it would be a
[35:10] man we just would just step back to
[35:12] something that you can kind of some sort
[35:14] of a spiritual you bring it to but maybe
[35:17] it would be Cecil DeMille and and you've
[35:21] you've got you'd like to bring Moses to
[35:24] life you'd like to bring the Ten
[35:26] Commandments to life
[35:28] you like to bring it in such a much of a
[35:31] life until a prophet of the day would be
[35:33] enamored by the pillar of fire that was
[35:36] in there you'd like to bring it to life
[35:39] to word that people would not see the
[35:41] character or the man that is taken the
[35:45] script of Moses that they would see
[35:48] Charlton Heston
[35:51] but they would see a man so step into a
[35:55] role until it was more than just a
[36:00] mechanical of of speaking to where that
[36:05] the script would come so alive
[36:09] now you got to remember man like
[36:12] Charleston Heston would have to have a
[36:14] gift in his life to where he could hide
[36:16] himself so much all of his personal
[36:20] desires and all of his personal goals
[36:22] would be here away in a private life to
[36:27] where when he slept on set he was Moses
[36:33] and when he throwed the rock down and it
[36:36] turned to a snake he had become a God to
[36:40] Pharaoh he had to get anointed to be
[36:45] able to play the role had to have such a
[36:48] gift to bring him into that role to win
[36:52] he's stretching his hands out over the
[36:54] sea and the wind is blowing in his hair
[36:57] he writes even about it that he felt
[37:01] like it was so real Teli could see
[37:05] himself as Moses now that's Hollywood
[37:12] when it finished they gave them
[37:15] incredible crown of incredible amounts
[37:18] of money and rewards for their their
[37:20] great acting and this one got an award
[37:22] and that one got her Ward's Cecil
[37:24] DeMille got an award they'll always be
[37:26] remembered for those parts but after it
[37:29] was over with traulsen Heston had
[37:32] trouble going back into his private life
[37:36] because he had so become Moses until he
[37:42] lost his identification as Charles said
[37:45] have stood and he had to take on
[37:48] different roles to get himself out of
[37:50] that we're not role playing here to not
[37:58] watch me cannot I so want to lose myself
[38:02] in the Jesus crash I don't want to go
[38:08] back and find that man ever again
[38:11] [Applause]
[38:20] he is my source of strength he is my
[38:24] energy he is the one that feeds my soul
[38:26] day to day brother on my troubles and my
[38:39] situations and you remember when God
[38:42] came to job his friends had turned on
[38:48] him called him a sacred sinner his wife
[38:53] it even came to the point she was done
[38:55] with him it lost it all he had been a
[38:58] man that many people came to and rulers
[39:01] and Kings came to him and sought counsel
[39:04] with him he'd be a man that many people
[39:06] looked up to he was wealthy beyond
[39:08] measure had an incredible family but
[39:13] because a conference happen in heaven
[39:16] and because the conference happened in
[39:19] heaven what goes on in heaven goes on in
[39:22] the earth and a conference went on in
[39:24] heaven and God asked the enemy have you
[39:29] considered have you considered my
[39:35] surfing joke and and listen the enemy
[39:40] tells God you got a token about him
[39:45] you got a hedge about it
[39:48] you got angels watching over it and his
[39:52] word is protecting him are you listening
[39:59] now
[39:59] God's going to set this as an example
[40:02] for all humanity
[40:07] because God had confidence in the god
[40:09] that lived in job he had confidence in
[40:16] him
[40:16] brother Bram said God could have
[40:17] confidence in Abraham because he'd
[40:19] fellowship with him have you ever come
[40:23] to a place when you realize that you're
[40:25] not in the room by yourself this morning
[40:30] I was sitting in my office I was sitting
[40:33] there I'd been there about four hours I
[40:35] was sitting in my office and I just
[40:38] realized after a bit I wasn't alone sir
[40:45] will you saw my office and I'm sitting
[40:47] at the end of that table and I'm I'm
[40:49] listening to the word I'm I'm going
[40:52] through the quotes I'm reading I'm
[40:54] placing and I'm just following the path
[40:56] as it's opening up the channel as it
[40:58] begins to flow I'm just I've been
[41:01] flowing in it all week but it just
[41:03] seemed not not to be going in direction
[41:05] the you know and that it had to be going
[41:08] and god I just I just kind of felt like
[41:10] all of a sudden I'm not alone and then
[41:16] it just began to go we just began to
[41:18] just flow it begin to flow I would say
[41:21] that's kind of like Abraham was when he
[41:23] was sitting with him and he was looking
[41:27] across at a man and he'd entertained a
[41:29] lot of strangers but nobody spoke like
[41:34] this man and he realized he didn't have
[41:38] beginning today's or end of days and he
[41:41] was an eternal plan and this man knew
[41:44] about the covenant was between him and
[41:47] God and he explained that you know that
[41:50] thy seed will possess the gates of their
[41:52] enemy and he realized he wasn't talking
[41:56] to a man just sometimes you realize this
[42:02] is way more than a man
[42:12] God came to job I find it interesting
[42:16] that God doesn't talk any about his
[42:19] troubles when God came to job II he
[42:25] doesn't have a pity party with him he
[42:29] doesn't talk about his lost children his
[42:31] lost assets has lost his lost land and
[42:35] all different kinds of things and he's
[42:36] lost all of these things he gonna had a
[42:39] long list those that can't seem to get
[42:45] the light of day you might want to read
[42:46] the book of Job a little bit and
[42:48] especially 38 and I love God to speak to
[42:52] you when God talks to you he don't talk
[42:55] about temporary things many people make
[42:59] decisions about temporary things and
[43:02] temporary feelings you need to always
[43:05] base everything on the Word of God
[43:09] relationships on the Word of God
[43:11] marriages on the Word of God listen put
[43:17] God first and everything in your life
[43:19] and if God is your friend he'll back you
[43:23] up no matter where you're at
[43:33] where was you at job when I laid the
[43:36] foundations of the earth explain to
[43:43] mountains and rivers and the heavens and
[43:46] the zodiac and he took him through all
[43:49] of that where was you at
[43:54] imagine Joba had felt big in his life at
[43:58] times but now in the presence of God
[44:07] it's quite different I've had people
[44:15] that told me that they had a lot of
[44:17] questions they wanted to talk to brother
[44:19] Branham about whenever he would get out
[44:22] of the car all those questions what went
[44:26] they were gone his presence was
[44:29] different than anybody else right here
[44:36] in Richmond one of our brothers was a
[44:43] quick you know sometimes we find herself
[44:47] as critics when we really don't know you
[44:50] know it's kind of its kind of like you
[44:52] ever hear somebody talking about
[44:53] somebody they really don't know you know
[44:58] they just you know and you just stand
[44:59] there and go they don't know him they
[45:02] don't know it they're just talking
[45:03] foolishness they're just ignorant in
[45:05] their own thoughts they don't know him
[45:07] and so this man was kind of like a man
[45:10] in the scriptures named Zacchaeus he was
[45:13] his wife was coming to the meeting and
[45:16] as she was coming to the meeting that
[45:18] was done it was she was there and she
[45:21] was a real Christian and she'd go home
[45:24] and tell him so I I saw the pillar of
[45:26] fire man said the pillar Flyers over and
[45:30] said I looked and there it was they said
[45:33] angel Lord is here and he said I'll tell
[45:35] you I saw the angel of the Lord myself
[45:39] I've asked others they didn't sit by I
[45:41] saw it
[45:42] I saw it I saw this miracle I saw that
[45:45] miracle I heard of sermon I've never
[45:47] heard it place like that in my life that
[45:49] man's a prophet well her husband doctor
[45:52] said I put an end to this obviously not
[45:56] knowing the size of the meeting and not
[45:58] knowing people would be outside for
[45:59] hours before his arrival and and and he
[46:03] showed up at a meeting that was unlike
[46:05] any he'd ever been to and they had
[46:07] picked him they hand-picked him to take
[46:10] brother branham from the car you talking
[46:15] about accuracy hand fits him to take
[46:21] brother branham from the car to get him
[46:24] through the door and lead him to the
[46:26] stage now here's a creek and he gets
[46:31] hand-picked out of all these thousands
[46:33] of people that he would be the man to
[46:35] take brother branham from the from the
[46:37] car and he said you know I was standing
[46:40] there and I had lost lots of my heart
[46:41] and I you know I had a lot of questions
[46:43] I had a lot of things I wanted to say
[46:44] and he said when he got out of the car
[46:46] all that was going and said he sit there
[46:50] and talked to me and he said I could
[46:52] tell by his eyes he knew everything and
[46:53] I I was saying and said we kind of we
[46:57] kind of walked toward and I was right
[46:59] there with him he said it would kind of
[47:01] walk toward the building made her way
[47:02] through the crowd he said we got to the
[47:04] building he said brother brother just
[47:05] kind of turn said he was real gentleman
[47:07] said he just turns it would you mind
[47:10] holding my hat while I preach and he
[47:16] said there I was a real critic holding
[47:23] his hand
[47:25] and you realized this man's exactly what
[47:31] my wife said he was brother branham as
[47:35] he's preaching in New York to those
[47:37] businessmen they was expecting some
[47:40] great intellectual thought maybe some
[47:43] great great demonstration of gift and
[47:48] they thought he's going to say something
[47:49] eloquent to Herman and he comes to them
[47:52] and talks about Zacchaeus the
[47:54] businessman and what he's really telling
[47:58] them it's businessman Jesus wants to
[48:01] come to your house and you're finding
[48:06] yourself in a tree with a lot of garbage
[48:08] on you a lot of people live double lives
[48:15] one life in church and another life in
[48:18] another fact that's not a token life
[48:23] that's not a life worthy of the gospel
[48:26] of Jesus Christ
[48:28] let Jesus stop under your tree take him
[48:43] home take him home make a welcome let
[48:51] him change your life what if Jesus came
[49:03] to my house it's more than a song what
[49:06] would you have to put up what would you
[49:10] have to hide there's anything in that
[49:13] list take care of it
[49:16] I said these words to you the other
[49:27] night night I couldn't get away from we
[49:31] talked about spark this is something
[49:35] that just moved me very deeply when you
[49:39] begin to think about what Adam stepped
[49:41] out of and God's great plan of
[49:45] redemption what he stepped out of we're
[49:49] about to step into are you with me now
[49:55] sometimes it grace brings us incredible
[49:57] sorrow to lose a loved one and I'm
[50:01] talking about it affects us for the rest
[50:04] of our lives for our loved one to step
[50:07] beyond that veil of Tears but if we can
[50:09] look at it the way glad looks at that
[50:14] last breath here was the first breath
[50:16] there to step from this realm sister
[50:24] Gabrielle she's getting ready to be
[50:27] mother again it's a lot of thoughts a
[50:31] lot of what this baby will be like she
[50:36] has three others will it be like this or
[50:38] that and it'll have its own nature and
[50:42] will have its own spirit have its own
[50:44] actions because written in the Lamb's
[50:47] Book what's that name that had to be
[50:51] expressed now this might have been a
[50:55] surprise to you but it was not a
[50:59] surprise to grok
[51:02] because that attribute must be displayed
[51:06] on the earth and as it comes there's an
[51:12] expectation to go through you remember
[51:17] what it was like to be a mother before
[51:18] but every every child has a different
[51:21] sequence in a different cycle and a
[51:24] different manifestation and that spirit
[51:28] of that child that warm presses are come
[51:30] to you and they become a different glow
[51:32] on you and you'll come into that season
[51:34] of giving giving that child birth now
[51:39] it's very comfortable where it's at the
[51:43] kicks it pushes it makes great actions
[51:48] it causes you heartburn you've been
[51:53] nauseated they'd like to stay but
[51:57] because of travail that child has to be
[52:02] forced and it takes between life and
[52:07] death to force that child from that
[52:10] world into this world help me preach now
[52:15] oh if we could just catch a moment the
[52:20] great expectation from this life to that
[52:23] life it's more real than this world
[52:28] [Applause]
[52:38] Neil Armstrong had always been enamoured
[52:42] as a child since a child he wanted to be
[52:46] on the moon he had an incredible
[52:51] sensational desire to step on the moon
[52:56] sits a kid it was born with that he was
[53:02] born with a desire nobody's ever been
[53:07] there
[53:10] he wanted to go there's a program that
[53:15] they were had an aspiration to put a man
[53:17] not just around the moon behind the moon
[53:22] but man can't live there so you have to
[53:25] take Earth's environment and go stand
[53:29] there so it has to be developed now why
[53:34] was that going on because there was a
[53:36] message with the people with a
[53:41] sensational desire hallelujah to live
[53:46] into two worlds at the same time
[53:50] hallelujah to be the bride of Jesus
[53:52] Christ and it was more than horse and
[53:55] buggy age and it was more than an
[53:58] airplane age but it was an astronaut age
[54:01] like an eagle just kept sorry higher and
[54:05] higher I've ever ever denominational
[54:08] Creed every cold Creed an idea an ism a
[54:13] man an organization of man to break
[54:18] every sound barrier every tradition
[54:21] barrier every realm every demonic
[54:24] religious power because God was creating
[54:28] an astronaut eggs to bring this back in
[54:32] the order for a rapture I don't know
[54:48] what it felt there's no way I could
[54:51] understand what it felt like
[54:58] but to have set in the seat and all of
[55:05] your dreams are now you've kissed your
[55:08] wife no I haven't seen the movie
[55:16] but to have kissed your wife and you
[55:20] don't know there's a lot of unknowns
[55:22] here it's a lot of unknowns but to sit
[55:28] in the chair buckle yourself in and all
[55:30] the ways that would be buckled and to
[55:33] feel the force
[55:34] getting ready there's been a lot of
[55:39] trial preparations have been an
[55:44] incredible amount of hours and just
[55:47] millions of hours spent in preparation
[55:50] but to hear those 10 everything I feel
[56:01] like going to the moon myself right now
[56:05] sometimes I walk to a pulpit and I know
[56:09] what I've got inside of my heart and
[56:12] what he's delivered to me it's like
[56:14] sitting on the top of a astronaut bubble
[56:17] ship and knowing we're going to take a
[56:21] trip for about an hour and a half in the
[56:23] heavenly realms and we're gonna leave
[56:26] Walmart and we're gonna leave our jobs
[56:28] we're gonna leave the situation's of
[56:31] life and we're gonna spend some time in
[56:33] the eternal and you can feel you can
[56:43] feel that momentum shifting to another
[56:45] gear and the word has priority and the
[56:49] word has an anointing and an inspiration
[56:52] to it it's got life it's got life and he
[57:05] would make the statement when he stepped
[57:08] out of that craft and he stepped down
[57:11] that ladder I remember as a boy in
[57:14] school
[57:16] they would play it over and over again
[57:19] one
[57:22] small step for a man one giant step for
[57:29] mankind
[57:37] Ruth types us when she said this in a
[57:44] very very very what you might say very
[57:50] small space with a lot of pressure and a
[57:53] lot of realm where thou dwellest were
[57:56] thy diced I'll die let me just go back
[58:03] to there and treat me not to leave thee
[58:07] or to return from following after thee
[58:10] whither thou goest I will go and if
[58:14] wonder if we say this to God oh but that
[58:21] was Ruth but Ruth is our kite whether
[58:29] thou goest I'll go whether they'll
[58:32] lodgest I will Lodge thy people will be
[58:36] my people thank God my god without dice
[58:41] will I die and there will I be burned
[58:45] the Lord do so to me and more also if
[58:50] aught but death part thee all but that
[58:58] was that was Ruth Genesis 32 and Jacob
[59:06] was left alone and that wrestled a man
[59:09] with him the breaking of the day and
[59:11] when he ever saw he prevailed not
[59:14] against him he touched the hollow of his
[59:15] thigh the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
[59:18] out of joint near a sow with him and he
[59:21] said let me go the day breaketh and he
[59:24] said I will not let thee go except thou
[59:29] bless me it was more than Jacob
[59:33] was involved in this all of Jacob's seed
[59:40] the mind of God was involved in a man
[59:45] wrestling with the angel this is much
[59:48] bigger than you I'm gonna bring it to a
[59:53] close in a little bit sometimes we get
[59:55] so consumed it's all about me forget
[59:57] that this is way bigger than you and lay
[1:00:03] on a sail we got this hiatus we're not
[1:00:07] looking for another messenger we're not
[1:00:10] looking for nobody to copy even brother
[1:00:12] branham but we're looking for the God
[1:00:15] that lived in Paul and Peter and James
[1:00:17] and John that same God to live inside of
[1:00:21] us and sometimes we got a wrassle with
[1:00:31] the angel knowing it's more than about
[1:00:34] me it's about my family my grandchildren
[1:00:38] my great-grandchildren do you know I
[1:00:43] pray for my grandchildren's spouse
[1:00:49] that's silly I pray for my children
[1:00:54] before they were born I pray for my
[1:01:02] grandchildren and their spouses because
[1:01:07] supposedly their spouses are on the
[1:01:09] earth we get so consumed with our
[1:01:14] children but what about listen this just
[1:01:20] hasn't accidentally happened oh I just
[1:01:23] walked in and I got lucky there's no
[1:01:25] luck involved in a real Christian no
[1:01:29] luck involved with a real Christian it's
[1:01:32] dedicatedly committed to it for God
[1:01:39] or the state but one time God don't need
[1:01:42] your best
[1:01:43] well would you hire a man if he told you
[1:01:45] that you wouldn't you didn't he he
[1:01:47] didn't need your best I am I know that
[1:01:53] we we must surrender our whole heart to
[1:01:56] God come on church but God needs all of
[1:02:03] you oh but I got all these abilities
[1:02:08] God's not even looking for your
[1:02:10] abilities he's looking for your
[1:02:13] dependability and then what he uses give
[1:02:21] your best to that what do you choose
[1:02:23] this to channel you will brother on all
[1:02:27] I know to do is a man and praise the
[1:02:29] Lord do it the best that you know how to
[1:02:31] do when you put your hands together let
[1:02:35] heaven hear it you just can't believe
[1:02:45] the unseen forces that you've overcome
[1:02:47] this week just to continue to be here
[1:03:00] this week or Sunday the registration for
[1:03:05] the youth camp came open they register
[1:03:11] over 500 young people 20 ages of I think
[1:03:14] 13 to whatever I preached that meeting
[1:03:18] several times and it's been supernatural
[1:03:21] every time that we've been there we've
[1:03:23] seen incredible miracles happen just to
[1:03:28] give you for instance so the last time I
[1:03:29] was there Mariah came through the prayer
[1:03:32] line God restored her hair I'm going
[1:03:39] somewhere with all this loot Dru walked
[1:03:42] across that platform and as I walked
[1:03:44] walked him across the platform I began
[1:03:46] to talk to them that
[1:03:48] cross this platform many of you later
[1:03:50] tonight is going to walk in a prayer
[1:03:52] line now maybe you don't believe in
[1:03:56] prayer lines and maybe you'll be
[1:03:59] critical but you might be like the man
[1:04:03] that talks about somebody he don't know
[1:04:05] if you've never been through a real
[1:04:08] godly anointed prayer life one that
[1:04:12] where man don't get all the attention
[1:04:14] but God is there to do the work where
[1:04:17] it's a showdown between God and the
[1:04:20] enemy I begin to describe it at that in
[1:04:27] a little while the people are going to
[1:04:28] walk across this by the hundreds we're
[1:04:32] going to preach the Word of God that
[1:04:33] will build faith to get you ready for
[1:04:35] this prayer line in a few moments you'll
[1:04:38] walk through this prayer line and you'll
[1:04:40] never be the same
[1:04:46] Moriah walk through that prayer line
[1:04:49] with three bobby pins in her hand with a
[1:04:57] with a hat on her head
[1:04:59] no hat but she walked across there with
[1:05:03] an expectation for the promise of God to
[1:05:07] be fulfilled her pastor had prayed for
[1:05:11] her brother Jim had prayed for filling
[1:05:13] unction that she was like the church the
[1:05:19] bride through seven church ages is to be
[1:05:22] restored to her original glory
[1:05:24] and she was a type of restoration you
[1:05:31] could see that girl today see her hair
[1:05:33] is beautiful and she's a beautiful lady
[1:05:35] hair all the way down the back now she's
[1:05:39] restored to her glory I'll never forget
[1:05:41] the first time that I brought her up on
[1:05:43] this stage after the miracle begin to
[1:05:45] happen and she had never taken her hat
[1:05:47] off in public and I begin to talk about
[1:05:49] the miracle that happened that God was
[1:05:52] restoring the glory because hair is the
[1:05:56] glory that God was restoring that glory
[1:05:59] back to her and when she took her hair
[1:06:02] off it felt like every atom in the
[1:06:05] building was electrified with the Holy
[1:06:07] Ghost it would be in that meeting it
[1:06:17] they would carry me off the stage and
[1:06:20] take me to the cabin suite we'll go to
[1:06:25] the cabin brother Aaron
[1:06:27] but the Tim winters carries me to the
[1:06:30] car wrapped in a big blanket he carries
[1:06:32] me to the car
[1:06:33] prayer lines still going on miracles are
[1:06:36] happening and let me just stop her just
[1:06:41] a moment the last one I prayed for was
[1:06:43] name sister Jessica Martin and when she
[1:06:47] came through the prayer line I remember
[1:06:48] the words that were spoke to her I give
[1:06:51] you back your son do you say well
[1:06:53] brother on by what authority do you have
[1:06:55] the Word of God are you with me
[1:06:59] somebody's got to put them the check and
[1:07:02] write it out it isn't a man about me
[1:07:06] it's about God's Word being fulfilled
[1:07:08] that was a son that needed to come home
[1:07:10] and it was in a very wayward condition
[1:07:13] maybe you boys knew that boy but that
[1:07:16] boy came to the Lord and it's a real
[1:07:18] Christian now and has a family dedicated
[1:07:21] his life to God why God came on the
[1:07:25] scene it's more than Hattie right I give
[1:07:29] you your boys what about your children
[1:07:34] let's call for the product us to come
[1:07:37] home let's call for moms and dads and
[1:07:40] wayward Christians
[1:07:44] where's our expectation all could it's
[1:07:48] Park tonight we would walk in the room
[1:07:58] but there is a real gentleman he takes
[1:08:01] us in the room and I just turned to him
[1:08:04] and I said you'll never be the same from
[1:08:07] this night forward you're you're called
[1:08:09] to preach the Ministry of the word of
[1:08:11] God
[1:08:13] that's been on a long time but from this
[1:08:17] night you'll never be the same
[1:08:19] get bid arms a big man begin to throw
[1:08:22] his irons back you said brother on I've
[1:08:25] heard that a hundred times hear it again
[1:08:29] here again he's suffering with the
[1:08:32] condition in his body that the doctors
[1:08:34] don't know what it is but I'll tell you
[1:08:36] the same God that was in that room I'm
[1:08:40] talking to you now by prophetically the
[1:08:42] same God that was in that room there's
[1:08:45] the same God that a heal his body
[1:08:59] obviously now the doctors has declared
[1:09:05] they they say he has symptoms of ALS and
[1:09:08] we know that's a horrible disease but
[1:09:10] God's greater God's greater than those
[1:09:16] initials God's greater than that demon
[1:09:19] power hallelujah I got a clip of him
[1:09:25] preaching the other night in Dallas
[1:09:28] Texas preaching and there was some of
[1:09:30] the most powerful preaching it only got
[1:09:33] about a six minute clip it was some of
[1:09:35] those powerful preach and I've ever
[1:09:36] heard boo devil boo devil
[1:09:41] stepping to the challenge of the hour
[1:09:44] when Goliath walks in your field you
[1:09:49] must meet the challenge and within
[1:09:59] seconds the vision comes of Isaac we've
[1:10:06] all enjoyed that miracle we've all
[1:10:10] enjoyed we've all enjoyed I want to take
[1:10:19] you give me just a couple more moments I
[1:10:21] know we have communion but one morning
[1:10:28] just at the end of the sleep I see a
[1:10:36] mineral a large audience sitting in this
[1:10:41] large audience I'm standing there and
[1:10:44] I'm going to say some things that are
[1:10:46] very prophetic here and I want to thank
[1:10:48] a friend of mine named Tim Pruitt for
[1:10:52] bringing it back to me you see last week
[1:11:01] you see a friend of mine sitting in this
[1:11:07] building brought me a prior cloth and
[1:11:12] had never been on anybody that we know
[1:11:16] of but it had been in acts 19 in a Bible
[1:11:20] I'm not gonna call his name for four
[1:11:22] reasons but this is one of brother
[1:11:25] branham's alas suits that he preached in
[1:11:29] and it had been in an attic for a long
[1:11:32] time but that's a promise of God brother
[1:11:42] on this is just another trial well that
[1:11:44] just shows you're not no you're not in
[1:11:46] the valley with me last week I walked to
[1:11:53] with the notes of although suffering
[1:11:55] standing be healed and that morning when
[1:11:59] I had that visitation I saw I saw a
[1:12:03] large crowd and brother Timothy Pruett
[1:12:06] comes to the pulpit and he preaches on
[1:12:08] the resurrection and the life and then
[1:12:14] brother temper comes to the pulpit and
[1:12:16] he begins to it begins to address the
[1:12:18] audience and he said I have a special
[1:12:20] friend here and he calls me by name and
[1:12:24] said but the wrong Spencer and that's an
[1:12:28] important part although suffering stand
[1:12:32] and be healed he left me
[1:12:38] are you listening me and when it was
[1:12:40] over there was such an atmosphere in our
[1:12:43] bedroom until I danced across that
[1:12:46] bedroom and I spoke in other tongues
[1:12:48] because I believe in that
[1:12:58] and a road brother Tim pretty quickly
[1:13:02] and send him the note of the of the
[1:13:04] vision and the dream and I just I just I
[1:13:07] just I guess cynic I send and I didn't
[1:13:10] we give it full full sentences in total
[1:13:14] description but it had power to it that
[1:13:20] morning I sent it brother Davey before
[1:13:24] you had the accident this week brother
[1:13:28] Tim went back to time check it to make
[1:13:32] sure that I sent that before you were
[1:13:35] wrapped around a tree because that
[1:13:39] vision of Isaac had to come to pass and
[1:13:42] it had to come through you Satan
[1:13:45] couldn't take your life and you're a son
[1:13:49] of God and those promises are to a son
[1:13:52] that all hinge on you forever it's not
[1:13:57] his life the cake wrapped around the
[1:14:01] tree inches from your life crushed in
[1:14:05] your body and doctors would say you
[1:14:07] never have a child but God's face and
[1:14:11] had to take place Whitney's womb was
[1:14:14] built to work she couldn't have a child
[1:14:18] but God's Word had to take place my
[1:14:24] mother would have a heart attack later
[1:14:26] that evening and on Sunday morning
[1:14:30] God impressed Saturday night after
[1:14:32] service God spoke to me to go to her
[1:14:34] side and that next morning I went to her
[1:14:37] side and on the way they called and said
[1:14:38] she was coding and brother Tim calls me
[1:14:43] and he said brother on your version is
[1:14:48] about to happen both of them will stand
[1:14:52] and be healed Davey will stand and be
[1:14:56] healed
[1:14:56] and your mom is getting ready to stand
[1:14:58] up into a new body but there Hendra and
[1:15:03] myself walked into the room and I think
[1:15:04] about eight different people was working
[1:15:07] on my mother and my mother was as calm
[1:15:09] as I am right now
[1:15:10] maybe calmer had a little conversation
[1:15:15] with her and they went right back to
[1:15:17] work and the doctor came to her and had
[1:15:19] his last conversation and he said
[1:15:21] Christine and he begins to talk to her
[1:15:23] and she said I'm ready to go and she
[1:15:30] went Hollywood can't write it when your
[1:15:38] last words are not fear I'm ready
[1:15:43] everything that's not Neil Armstrong
[1:15:46] that's a child of God from one room to
[1:15:51] another round thirst evening brother Tim
[1:15:57] calls me or you you know I tell him I
[1:16:00] said I'll call you when I get finished
[1:16:01] so he so he we waited as a day went on
[1:16:05] my day went a little bit longer than I
[1:16:07] expected to go brother Tim just wrote me
[1:16:10] a little note he said are you are you
[1:16:13] something to the effect are you ready
[1:16:16] now and literally I was walking through
[1:16:19] my door at the house I literally was
[1:16:21] stepping through the door and I just
[1:16:22] called him and I said I think you've got
[1:16:24] a camera on my house we spoke for about
[1:16:30] an hour and talked about things stuff
[1:16:34] and then after about 20 minutes we came
[1:16:38] to this this what I'm holding now
[1:16:44] brother Tim has preached this that I
[1:16:47] know of about five times in very large
[1:16:49] conventions and you talk about massive
[1:16:54] miracles have happened to people he
[1:16:59] never saw the vision I did he got a
[1:17:03] spark are you catching it now he got a
[1:17:09] spark off of it
[1:17:12] this vision is more than happening and
[1:17:16] it's more than for people it's more than
[1:17:20] for David it's more than for my mother
[1:17:22] it's for the entire pride may this bride
[1:17:27] standing be healed
[1:17:31] [Applause]
[1:17:50] you can you can stay standing now but he
[1:17:54] said brother on I want to tell you in
[1:17:57] that visitation he said I did not you I
[1:18:02] did not call Davey's name I did not call
[1:18:06] your mother's name I called you your
[1:18:08] name and he said Ron Spencer stand and
[1:18:16] be healed now here's how it all happened
[1:18:23] you can't arrange it we had that
[1:18:25] conversation literally literally in the
[1:18:31] same spot in the floor where I was
[1:18:33] speaking in tongues trying to put all
[1:18:38] that together we're years now waiter and
[1:18:41] I and I get to the privacy of my room
[1:18:45] and I'm sitting in a certain spot and we
[1:18:47] come to that part of the conversation
[1:18:48] and he says Ron Spencer stand and be
[1:18:51] healed and I said I'm sitting in the
[1:18:54] same spot what about your situation what
[1:19:09] about your need not just your physical
[1:19:12] need but that eternal part could you
[1:19:19] reach out by faith those even in the
[1:19:24] unseen on its could you reach out by
[1:19:26] faith let Jesus take your life there's
[1:19:31] something with it maybe you've been a
