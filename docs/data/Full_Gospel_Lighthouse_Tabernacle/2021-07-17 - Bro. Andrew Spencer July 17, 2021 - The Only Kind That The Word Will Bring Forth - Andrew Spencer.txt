the hour that we're living in the hour where miracles are being produced right amongst us it's a miracle that you're here it's a miracle that you made it through another week and we're still standing brother branham would say that you got to become a miracle before you can ever see one there's miracles setting all across this room amen can you attest and witness to that just now that you're a miracle of the grace of almighty god amen certainly thankful to have sister del moynes with us mr rivera she was an accident a few weeks back and and just very grateful that she's okay had a few minor things go on but very grateful to have her with us that's a miracle amen so thankful to have each and every one of our visitors here but we're thankful to have the lord jesus here amongst us what an atmosphere that's in this place this evening we know that in the atmosphere like this this is where eagles are born amen this is where eagles are born amen amen let's just let's just go to the word tonight let's go let's turn over in the book of acts chapter 1. book of acts chapter 1 and then then also down to acts chapter 2. amen acts chapter 1 and verse 4 and as you're as you're finding that this evening in the pergamon church age he said when the bride will get back to being a word bride she will produce the very works that jesus produced amen the word is god the spirit is god they are all one one cannot work apart from the other so it's going to take the same faith as jesus had to produce the same works that jesus did acts chapter 1 and verse 4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence verse 8 but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and under the uttermost part of the earth acts chapter 2 and verse 1. and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared under them cloven tongues like as a fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave utterance and there were dwelling at jerusalem but devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein were we born parthians and medies and elohimites and the dwellers of mesopotamia and judea and cappadocia and politics and asia for gaia and paphilia and egypt and the parts of libya about syrian and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of god and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this others mocking said these men are full of new wine but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith my saith god that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out on in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy let us go to the author of the word this evening making known our request and our petitions for we are a needy people but he is the god that supplies all of our needs let's just call on the god of heaven in one word and one accord just now father god we have come before you tonight lord as we humble ourselves under the presence of the most high god realizing father that thou art here because your word spoke it and we believe it father that two or three are gathered in your name there you would be in the midst of them and father we agree father to us now that you're going to do mighty things amongst us and i ask father that as the spirit would go forth just now and give utterance to the things that that are desired to be said lord you know those things before there ever spoke it and we pray that you would control our tongue to the things that you'd want once said and open our tongue to the things that you do father we ask father that you would meet the needs of your people those that have needs in their body we pray that you will present yourself to them as the great physician and i ask father that you would be mindful of every person on this on the way of the internet just now that you would minister them abundantly lord we pray god that you would come and pour out your spirit upon us afresh i know that there are those here that are desiring a fresh pentecostal experience and i asked father that they would experience the god of heaven more than a man and more than a church service but may the holy ghost birth them anew into the kingdom just now i pray father that you would make yourself known in this service in a mighty way in the name of jesus christ and the church says amen and the church said amen you may be seated in the presence of the lord i would like to speak to you tonight on the only kind that the word can bring forth the only kind that the word can bring forth and we know that if we would begin to look over in the book of genesis that we would see that that is the seed chapter in which we would be able to read and we won't take time for for time's sake to go through those things but we look through there in the first three chapters and we see that that god was bringing forth out of the out of the dust of the earth and we see that god would bring forth and the bible said let them bring forth of their own kind and we realize that god is in the business of producing sons of god and we look here and we see something quite amazing if you begin to look at the text you'll see that there's a hundred and twenty empty vessels that have gathered themselves in an upper room wherein and they're there in one accord but we we know that if we're very knowledgeable on the scriptures that the bible tells us over in the book of corinthians that there was seen of him of 500 at one time but yet god was not surprised that 380 of them were missing and did not make it up into the upper room because god knows all things and god knew who would be there and even the mary the mother of jesus christ had to be there because you see it had to be more than just carrying jesus in the womb it has to be jesus on the heart and we realize that the the the word can only bring forth of its kind and we know that there has been a promise that has been hanging over the children of god throughout the ages throughout throughout the the old testament you can see that there were promises that were hanging over the children in the days of abraham it was the promise or it was the time for the promised son of isaac to come forth in the days of jacob it was a time for joseph to rise to his position and his brother's bow before him but it had to come to a spot when faith would be arise or awaken to see that this was the time of visitation that god was coming to deal with his seed upon the earth at that time at that season and god does things in uncertain times and in uncertain ways but we understand that god is perfect in his timing and we get caught up in the delay a lot of times as human beings we get caught up thinking well god needs to do this or we need to see god do that or we need to move but god is perfect in his timing and in the deity of jesus he said the only thing you have to do when you see something in the bible that sounds just a little mystic and a little superstitious to you is just give god a little bit of time god's in no hurry we're the one that gets in a hurry just give god a little bit of time and you'll see the old prophetic wheels of cods run right up into the picture it'll develop just like bringing up out of a picture and again god's word must every time be fulfilled the cogs of god's prophecy grind slow but sure they grind slow but sure and if the vision is for an appointed time it will come to pass in the season in which god has destined it to come forth we know that it's a time to sow a time to plant and a time to harvest there is a time in which god is going to bring forth and we notice that it's just about the time that when joseph sends the gentile bride to the palace so that he can show himself as the son of righteousness as the son of prosperity to show himself to his brethren that the time of fulfillment is at at hand and the time is now for the gentile bride to move forward in the promises that god has laid out before her this is not a time to move back but it is the time to press the battle that was the voice that was heard from the other side when the prophet came back into this dimension he heard the voice saying press the battle press the battle press the battle and as the gentile bride of jesus christ it is the time not to give up it's a time to stand sure on the promises of god for this is the sure word of prophecy you're not going to help figure out god you're not going to out reason god you're not going to out figure god but this is a time to be quickened under the promises and if there is something that is going to bring forth then something has got to be pregnant before something can ever come out of the womb there's got to be a seed that is deposited and the prophet said that before the foundation of the world he knew you he saw you he called you by name he elected you he chose you he predestined you and he deposited that gene seed of god [Applause] god knows who his bride is god knows where she's at you can search the world over you can try to find it yourself but god sees her god knows her [Applause] this message will produce message people this message will produce miracles believing people because there is a people that believe that bible days are here again [Applause] hallelujah and christ is a mystery he said then all of our actions should declare him we have his name is that right we should bear his name and remember we are now as his bride pregnant with his spirit oh my the church bearing children see impregnated by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of life evident with the preeminences evidence of his resurrection showing that he is not dead but alive forevermore this is eternal life and vindicated vindicates to the world that we are alive in him how do you know because you're a church member no because christ is living through you so pregnant with his spirit that you're a prisoner to anything else you're confined oh my to the gospel confined to the word and all the children that you can bring forth as that because you're a prisoner you cannot commit adultery you're already pregnated glory he can't take hold the womb of life is closed to anything else you're already his by predestination that seed has come to life and no world can get in you see he has healed you until the day of redemption nothing can get in and nothing can get out what a testimony tonight that if the holy ghost has so sealed you you can't sin away your day of grace you can't make god mad and leave god ain't having a bad day god ain't having a bad hair day god ain't upset at you you're sealed you're filled with his spirit he deposited that seed and you're pregnant you're impregnated with a spirit no world can get in there no cosmos can get in there no laodicea can get in there no cancerous cell can get in there oh hallelujah you see god is not willing that your womb would be contaminated with the king of egypt he's not willing that your womb would be contaminated with serpent seed and you would carry about the reasoning and the ideology of humanity in this hour but he is watching over that seed and he's watching over that womb to make sure that nothing comes by and contaminates it he is watching over that seat to make sure that it gets to its final resting spot and we realize that the battle of the day and the battle throughout the ages has always been that of wisdom versus faith and we realize that it's two sources that were introduced in the beginning and they're being introduced again in this day it's wisdom versus faith and it's always a battle that we're there and we understand and we find out that god is the author of faith to believe for the people to believe and to trust his word and satan is the author of wisdom and he's trying to get the people to accept his wisdom and pull them away from the faith that's in god's word you see every time satan comes in and offers you education it's to steal away your knowledge of faith in the lord jesus it's not that we're against education it's not that we are against higher knowledge but there are two things that are an enemy to god and that's time and science and the very thing that started this whole mess that we're in this whole sin this whole system that we're in it was because satan produced a better plan or wanted to produce a better plan than god's he produced wisdom to eve that they might eat from the tree of knowledge but wisdom will not bring you closer to god it will take you further away from god but faith will bring you closer and actually if you have walked out on the tree of knowledge on wisdom faith will make you walk back that tree till you find where you left him at you might have left him at the school you might have left him at the book or you might have been like the one that left him at a baby that he was praying now and lay me down to sleep if you cannot find god go back to where you left him are you with me you see this message of today is to restore the faith back back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers you see doubt will come in and wisdom will come in but doubt will bring forth death i'm more of a positive man a whole lot more than i am a negative man and if the enemy comes in i just like to flip things around on the devil if he tells me that my children ain't going to make it what are you doing brother andrew you're flipping a negative into a positive they say that this message is just for you they say healing was for days gone by they say we ain't gonna make it we are gonna make it they say we're not elected that means we are elected they say we don't know nothing about god shake and whispers all kinds of lies in our ears we're turning the negative into the positive because this is a faith-building message the faith of paul was that we are more than conquerors through him that loved us the faith of paul said death where is this king o grave where is thy victory what is faith doing it's taking you from hearing ground to receiving ground you see you can hear it here but faith will take you where it's at faith will take you to where there's a handle at and you can open up the wells of almighty god it's the only kind that the word can produce is a faith believing people i wonder if there's anybody in the house of god that faith brought them to the result that they see that faith brought them to a promise and the promise brought you the result that the word promised and you say well i ain't seen it come to fruition yet you just hold on you just hold on it may look like he's not looking it may look like he's not walking your way but the son of man has got you held up behold the hands of jehovah confucius can't hold you buddha can't hold you muhammad can't hold you but behold the hands of jehovah he is upholding you and if you are in his hands no man can pluck you out of it hallelujah faith brought me to this faith will move mountains why will faith move mountains because the word calls for it to do so you see because the word called for it to do so there's going to be an elect bride in this day a gentile bride in this day why because we preach it or because we think it no because the word called for it there's a people that's destined for a rapture why because a word calls for it there's a people that's dressed why because the word calls for it and when you look over in the bible you see that there was a promise of a messiah that was coming because the word called for it and the bible said over in deuteronomy 18 and 15 that moses was standing there and he said the lord our god will raise up a prophet like unto myself right out of the midst of me and when when when philip found nathanael and he came to him running he said we have found him oh what a testimony service that must have been we found him the one that moses spoke of you ever went looking for something that you couldn't find and you looked all over you even searched for a whole lot of times and you couldn't find it but there had been thousands of years that have passed and the cogs of prophecy were rolling right in time it may have looked like the messiah wasn't coming but when philip found nathanael he said we have found him who moses spoke of who all the other prophets spoke of and here was the word himself declaring that he was there it was laying there all of that time but it was now the time of fulfillment all the prophets had foretold of his coming that a star will rise out of jacob he'd be born in bethlehem he'd be despised and rejected of men and the government would be upon his shoulders what was it it was history was being made and prophecy was being fulfilled so we could say it into this in this service today this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears there's a lot of people that are coming forth with blasphemous names and idolatry against versus christianity and there's a people that have no leadership but this day this scripture is fulfilled that there is a people on earth that is connected to the headship that body knows what to do because the head has said stay right here stay in this field eat in this field digest in this field stay in this field love in this field [Applause] worship in this field there ain't no other field for you ruth you can look out upon the daughters of israel they're everywhere else but ruth this is your place you don't have to get shook up by what the world is producing they're bringing forth members all the time but you are going to produce what boaz puts you here to do [Applause] hallelujah this is your time this is your time you've been sitting here waiting waiting for somebody to say when is your time now is your time you've been waiting for somebody to say when you could get the holy ghost i'm here to tell you now's your time you've been waiting for your time for to come for healing i want to say your time is right now [Applause] you say well brother andrew it's way past me i want to tell you your time is right now and if you go to testifying and witnessing that the time of the vision is now fulfilled when it was laying there that there would become a forerunner before the messiah and when john was standing there baptizing those what they would call somebody that there that was dunking people in the water trying to drown them he said he said i indeed baptize you with water but there's one coming after me whose shoes i'm not worthy to bear or to loose he said i baptize you with water but the one that is coming after me is mightier than myself he won't just baptize you with water he'll baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire what was john doing he was pointing to the one that was coming and the word always stays the same the word came to the prophet and the prophet spoke it and god never changes his system so it had to be a prophet standing this day to forerun the second coming of christ [Applause] what was that on the ohio river in 1933 as john the baptist's message for run the first coming of christ so will your message william branham forerun the second coming of christ there will be a people that will rise up out of the scriptures that'll believe that message why because the word called for it to be so it's the only kind that the word can bring forth that which was spoken by isaiah just going through some promises that which was spoken by isaiah was conceived in the womb of mary which was a prophecy was now a reality abraham had a promise that there was coming one he would be he would be the son he wouldn't be ishmael he wouldn't be a wild one but he would be one that is born out of laughter what was it it was a vision at one time but when isaac came forth it was a reality it was in vision form when jacob when jacob which was the forefather of the tribes he was a it was a problem it was a promise because he was a prophet and he would be able to look way out into the future because god is giving his prophets the ability to look past what they see and look into the future and jacob said don't you bury my bones down here and joseph being a prophet got that same revelation and he looked way out into the future when they were still in slavery when they were still getting whipped when they were still in trouble when pharaoh's mighty hand was upon him he said don't you bury my bones down here there ain't no resurrection power down here in egypt but take my bones up to palestine where there's coming a resurrection and the life what was it on easter morning that which was prophecy was made reality when the bible said there was an earthquake and many were seen by the pharisees of that land you know what kind of thing it was to done to to the high priest when he looked out there and said who's that that's abraham that's sarah what was it doing and then they vanished right before their eyes it was prophecy but now it's made a reality it's modern events made clear by prophecy they say oh brother andrew you know what you're doing i'm following the leadership of the lord what was it joseph was testifying that there was one coming so can i have the spirit of prophecy just now and say there's one coming to your situation there's healing coming to your body there's miracles that are being spoke over your life i'll say oh brother andrew that's that's pretty far out there that's pentecostal that's too far let me say this the son of man is making an invasion right now he's coming through your warfare he's coming through your mind battles he's coming through your circumstance the son of man is interested in breaking apart the darkness by the light of the word [Applause] oh my the bible says in first john 3 and 7 he says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth and you look at that word doeth it means work righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous and we know that if this verse means anything at all it means that what a man does he is you're known by your works god sees your faith but everybody else sees your works so if you put forth a half-hearted effort you're going to produce half-hearted results if you only put half the check in the bank you're only getting half the check out the bank are you with me if you only come here with with the idea of just another service or just another meeting you're only going to get just another meeting but if you put your whole heart into it and you seek him with your whole mind you seek him with your whole heart you seek him with all your energy and all your spirit you're gonna get some results that only the word can bring forth this ain't some man that's trying to puff you up work you up if this word doesn't take you to another level you need to get your bail checked because if this don't make your bell ring a little bit something's wrong you lost your bell they say oh brother andrew you don't know what you're talking about a bunch of bells oh yes i do when you walk into the hole he's a holiest you got to have your bells on screaming holy holy holy unto the lord god that priest was dressed right that priest had blood dripping off of his face he walked in there with the ephit and it was the most important thing that he was wearing it had the breastplate of righteousness upon it but on that ephod was the shoulder pieces and there upon those shoulder pieces was the names of israel so when the high priest walked in there he was not walking in there alone he was walking in there with the tribes of israel upon them and when jesus went to the cross he was not alone but you were identified with him he was carrying you upon his shoulders the government shall be upon his shoulders now we got your bells wrong we got them set up right let's ring the devil's bell you're the only kind that the word can bring forth the word can't produce some half-hearted people the word can't produce some chickens of the age the word can only produce eagles the word can only produce daughters the word can only produce sons and if we are sons of god we're going to do the same works that our father did hallelujah amy it's got to be more than you like a black bird trying to stick peacock feathers in his in his coat trying to say he's a peacock all he is doing is trying to put up on a show and try to make himself self something that he ain't you see you've got to produce what's laying there are you with me are you with me just now you've got to produce the life that's laying on the inside of you that sheep does not manufacture that wall he just bears it because it's coming out he don't work himself up oh let me lay before the lord and let me work myself up to speaking in tongues oh no no no no no no no that sheep just bares it out that fruit tree that you got sitting out there that's full of oranges full of grapes and full of apples just now what is it it's simply bearing the life that's in it and you're only going to produce what's on the inside of you you can get worked up all you want to but until you're born again you'll never produce that which was laying there because we know we know that if a man is born of the word he will produce the word the work or the fruit of his life will be a product of the kind of seed or the life that is in him his works will be scriptural works if it's a scriptural birth the wind bloweth where it listed and man knows not where it cometh but that same wind that blew into the upper room is blowing through the building and he's bringing change he's bringing changes to circumstances you see it's got to be something that's laying on the inside before it can ever be produced if i would tell you that i have the life of a musician on the inside of me you would expect me to be able to play all of these instruments that are setting up here now i might be able to take some lessons and i might be able to gather a little bit of knowledge on how to play the piano but if i told you that i was a musician and i got up behind the piano and i couldn't play it then something would be wrong with my testimony is that right and if i told you that i had the life of uh of a mechanic laying on the inside of me and i i could build cars and i could put back cars and you you had a buddy that tore down you tore down your chevy truck and he ain't gonna put it back together but i told you i had the life of a mechanic on the inside of me you would come to me and say brother andrew said you're a mechanic you say you are i want you to go back in there and and take my chevy truck and put it back to pieces and i want you to put it back the way it it's meant to be and if i went in there and i started grabbing a manual and looking all over it and i was trying to put i was trying to put the fan belt over top on on the engine block somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be at you would say that there's something wrong with my testimony and if if i stand here and i say that i have the spirit of christ and i don't produce the spirit of christ then something is wrong with my testimony now i can learn some scriptures and i could learn how to say amen i can learn how to sing and i could learn how to say hallelujah but if there's no life behind my testimony then it's of no value are you with me if i had the life of a carpenter and i couldn't put up a a 10 shack then something's wrong with my testimony and if people are telling you that they're born again christians but never can never can make the bible talk for itself something's wrong with their testimony because jesus said the works that i do shall you do also and greater works than these shall you do because i go and to my father if you ask anything in my name i will do it [Applause] i want to tell you i as a preacher of this restored faith i'm not surprised by the mighty works that's going on and taking place because this is the hour and the time of restoration i'm not surprised because we know that this is the hour when the born-again experience has been restored divine healing that which was told was for the atonement on the other side has now been told to you that it is of the same atonement it has been restored back yes are you with me days old days gone by they said that it was that mark 11 was before the atonement was ever made but this what you have is an eternal atonement it covers before and it covers after let me bring it down to your knowledge so you'll gather what i'm saying it covers you before you were a christian and it covers you after you're a christian hallelujah this message has told you that you have the right to enforce the claim upon the enemy and tell him he's nothing but a squatter that's been restored back to you [Music] miracles has been restored signs has been restored wonders has been restored and the spirit has got to follow this word if it's if it's a true word it's got to follow it it's just like a conductor it follows that spirit follows where the word goes you can flip that switch on and electricity will come on where it's at and if it doesn't come on there there is something that is not arrived something's off somewhere but if you can get it fixed if you can get it turned around it'll produce the light that it was called to produce because it said that it would do it and if the word be preached in its fullness and believed and received it'll bring forth exactly what he said the bible says greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world so if he's greater why don't you let him be greater are you with me if he says that there's no weapon that's formed against you why don't you let it be no weapon that's formed against you if he said he sealed you till the day of your redemption why don't you let him be god and why don't you let yourself be the human and try and stop trying to get yourself involved in figuring out how the timing of it's got to be worth if he's greater let him be greater if he's stronger let him be stronger if he's wiser let him be wiser he's god he's god and the father he's god in the son he's god in the holy ghost he's god all three and one we'll produce only what the word said it would produce i look upon this church this is the only kind that the word can bring forth because the bible says in psalms 107 and 20 that he sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destructions and so we know that that christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts is that right so if it's a continuation it's got to bring forth the life that's laying there so let me say the life that's laying on the inside of this bride is not the life of confucius it's not the life of muhammad where they bring it to some idea this is not the idea uh uh this is not the life of buddha that'll bring you to some quiet food where you get yourself quiet and you get into a spot of solitude and you begin to think the right kind of thing and it'll produce what you think it will be that kind of life is as powerless as the grave they're in but the life that's on the inside of this bride is the life of the almighty of sufficient el shaddai the almighty jehovah the one that provides the one that sustains that life is there so it's got to be a continuation and shaken knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater works that she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's holy spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her let me remind you of some things you're more than a match for the enemy jesus was more than a match when he come against satan on the amount of temptation he was more than a match when he came against him at the garden of gethsemane he was more than a match for him when he come against him at calvary so let me say this to the true bride there ain't no circumstance there ain't no cancer there ain't no brain bleed there ain't no unthink unclean thing there ain't no disease there ain't no problems gonna stand in front there ain't nothing gonna stand in front of me get into my promise i am who i am because the i am tells me who i am same works same signs same miracles same healings same life same word same results same faith not something different but the same faith psalms 33 says by the word of the lord where the heavens made jesus trusted his own word he trusted and he believed his own word and the prophet said that he wrote the worlds off of his fingertips and he gave us insight into his mind i'm just like the spirit of the bride she has the mind of christ she only does what he commands so we get insight into his mind and he is saying to you church that if i did it you can do it if i took a man that had a withered hand and i told him to stretch out his hand and he stretched out his hand and it came forth and he didn't have no problems in his elbow no more and that which wasn't produced before was produced then because the author of life you see god wasn't concerned if it was going to be produced or not and god ain't concerned whether you're going to come to fruition or not let me get a little personal god ain't concerned if wesley's gonna walk or not he knows he's gonna walk god ain't concerned if hannah thomas is gonna walk down this aisle with a baby in a brown dress little girl come walking down that aisle god ain't concerned about that god ain't concerned if ron spencer gets well of cancer he's already seen him well god ain't concerned whether you're going to make it or going to lay out a seal and go by the way of the grave god said they're going to be a generation that'll rise up god ain't concerned god ain't shook up god ain't worried about what's going to go on it will produce what he said it would produce don't get caught up in the time of the things don't get caught up every morning he ain't seen yet god is as good as his word and he's looking for believers people that's got courage there's a lot of people got a lot of intellect but they don't have the courage to stand up behind the word of god but there's a people the only kind that the word can come forth out of [Applause] they'll be courageous when they stand before the prince of persia for 21 days and it seems like god ain't going to answer their prayer but daniel stayed there and he kept on praying when it looked like nobody was going with david down into the valley there was one mightier than himself that walked down into that valley [Music] the bible says in job 26-7 that he hangs the world on nothing i've been good for nothing my whole life i have been i have done wretched things all my life if god can take this universe and he holds it on nothing surely he can take a good for nothing nobody and make something out of him you're not nothing you're a child of the most high god the air that you breathe you think is just common as the blades of grass upon the upon the land out there but i want to tell you it's that air that sets the mighty eagles into its soaring path you look out upon it you can't even see it but it's that air that makes the eagle rise to another level what the enemy thinks is nothing is your everything [Applause] you thought you was just walking into a service you thought that this was just another time you didn't just walk in here with nothing you're leaving here with everything [Music] everything you have need of her life journey was given to you when you got the baptism of the holy ghost his word is infallible when he said there'd be a 42 inch caribou that would have been a 42 inch caribou whether he had been out there for 10 years waiting on somebody to come kill him or whether he was produced in a matter of seconds there was a 42 inch caribou still 42 inches you get caught up i got to get i got to make everything work it was told years before this come to pass years before it come to pass silver tipped grizzly bear 42 inch caribou and be a man with a green checkered shirt and to be a man had the hands about 18 years old looked like a child laying his hands upon it blaine wasn't supposed to be there he was supposed to be on another trip had biscuit wasn't supposed to have a green checkered church he said ruth you throw that thing away but you see it was a part of a vision and let me say this you can try to throw me away you can try to shut me up but i'm a part of the vision just as much as that green checkered shirt was a part of the vision [Applause] he asked him to man he don't have a green checkered shirt he said is there any animals like this up here no i've never seen anything like that up here i've never seen anything like that i i don't have a green checkered shirt you thought you brought nothing to this service you thought you walked in here with nothing but you carried something in here that's a part of the vision you could be sitting there and you might fall into a trap and get yourself soaking wet in a mess thinking why new world did my wife pack this green checkered shirt wasn't thinking about a vision that's what brother biscuit told us he said he said my mind wasn't on the vision he said he said but when i stood there at that 42 inch caribou he said i began to feel strange he said there's that green checkered shirt and bud's trying to pull that tape out he's trying to make it lay just right and it won't stay in place he says blaine put your hands there put your hands there and when blaine's hands laid on the horns of that 42-inch caribou brother branham said there it is which was spoken years in advance took six hours to produce you might die you might doubt what's coming to pass in this moment but the time is right now his word is infallible when he told his disciples you go up there and you wait until you're endued with power you're going to be in dude not many days hits what if they'd have got up there i said well we would have been up here six days seven days well we've done we don't walk with jesus we've done seen everything we know how to work like he works we've seen how he broke bread but somebody stood up saying no he said wait until you know wait until you are endued with power what were they doing up there all that time they were just sitting around the prophet said they were up there praising god until he came oh you might sit here and you're wondering when will it ever come to pass will the vision ever make its way you're sitting here you've got more than a green checkered shirt on you have a predestinated seed of god just praise him till it comes to pass and when it comes to pass it's going to be real and you won't have to bluff the devil the devil know you got it and the devil will run for cover you just praise him for his mighty acts praise him in the high sounding symbol praise him on the low sounding symbol they knew it would come to pass they waited there until the day of pentecost was fully come and when it was fully come there came a sound like a mighty rushing wind on the inside of there and it set upon them they knew they had it they knew they had and when they broke out everybody on the outside knew they had it because the word can only bring forth of this god peter a man that denied the lord stood up three days after that and said such as i have give out in the name of jesus christ when a man that that held the coat of stephen there when they were stoned in him his name was saw at that time but there came a pillar of fire by his way and he changed him from saul to paul to the greatest preacher in the new testament one that would write 14 books of your new testament bible and the bible said in acts chapter 16 when paul was sent by way of a vision over to macedonia and he was sent there he walked into a spot and the holy spirit don't say nothing he said don't just say nothing but he went over to macedonia and the holy spirit said speak on and when he started speaking and he started preaching the gospel there was a soothsayer a woman a divination that followed him around and said these are servants of the most high god now the bible said that this went on for days she was following them around following them around and saying these are servants of the most high god and the bible said that because of her sue saying that she being a fortune teller had brought the people and the men of influence much gain because of that spirit of divination you know what a spirit of divination is brother branham said it's a christian that's got a perverted spirit on them and here she was following them around saying these are servants of the most high god but paul didn't need no help from the devil to tell him who he was he knew who he was he knew he had power over that thing but paul was so led of the holy spirit that he would not cast that thing off until the holy spirit said rebuke that thing and when he rebuked that thing it immediately left and the men of influence got so upset because they lost their way of making money in the land they got so upset because they was preaching jesus christ of nazareth was the same yesterday today and forever and he was doing miracles and he was bringing forth healings they got so upset that the bible said that they threw them in the prison and they locked up their feet you know that's what the devils want to do to do to you today is lock up your feet to keep you from dancing but the bible said at the midnight hour that paul and silas sing songs and praises unto god and at that hour the earth began to quake and everybody not just paul and silas but everybody sitting in the prison house was set free let them break for the praise in this place that not only the parents not only the children but everyone all of our loved ones would get set free and you could go to dancing it's a time you take the shackles off of your feet you got something to dance about you got something to praise god about you're the only kind that the word can bring forth i want you to keep this in mind and i want you to conceive in your mind that the holy ghost is right here right now i want you to conceive in your mind that you're the only kind that the word can bring forth say that from your lips i'm the only kind that the word can bring forth now now now now if they could put up this quote for us in the invisible union he said he's speaking of the modern church he said you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks that they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church join cree going bold hair painted face there's no such a thing as that in all of it you don't find that in the word of god you find are you seeing yourself you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god that's the only kind that the word can bring forth what's going on brother andrew i'm bringing forth that which was deposited why you act that way i'm bringing forth i'm the only kind that the word can bring forth martini which was my grandma christine spencer we've known rustini all of our life and i'll tell you why we know her like that she didn't want to be called grandma so we caught her teeny my teeny i think she's known around as the bride of jesus christ by tina that's okay y'all can call her tina if you want to she's my teenia but my teeny was martini was was a very very very spirit-filled lady and at a very young age at a very young age she had joined the i believe it was the methodist church and she had signed her name to the church book and she'd come to the message and come to the knowledge of truth and she wanted to get her name off of that book here she was as a young little girl and they called in all the bishops and the priests of uh of that of that church they called her in they put her parents outside and they sat teeny right down in the middle of all of these men and they tried to convince her that she was doing the wrong thing but she stood there in the face of all of those bishops and so-called priests of that day and shut them up because of the word of truth this was a lady that was a only kind that the word could bring forth she knew who she was she knew where she came from and she knew where she was going and a few years back she'd been gone a couple years but a few years before she was gone she had went down to this message church or a message church at the time and she was down there and there was having a revival this is this this this preacher that was a real message preacher got to preaching on the baptism of the holy ghost and martini got up and started dancing and shouting in the spirit and began to speak in tongues and stepped out into the aisle began to dance and the deacons of that church came and set her down said we don't want none of that here and they're now dead it's 12 o'clock why because they had the spirit of my kale upon her and she could not bring forth children no more because they don't want knowing those acts 2 38 hollering blabbering speaking in tongues screaming they don't want it but we welcome it it's the only kind that the word can bring forth as well i don't know about all that shouting i don't know all about that excitement let me give you a scripture for it any time that jesus ever touched anybody they begin to shout the bible said that when the ten lepers came to him he told them go your way and show yourself to the high priest and as they went one turn back and shouted with a loud voice and he glorified god [Applause] [Music] oh there's power in your shout they say well oh i don't know about all that shout out and that's just new testament stuff let me give you some old testament the bible said in first chronicles 15 and 28 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with symbols making a noise with sultries and hearts i like a dead service where men say amen and they say words with great intelligence when they can speak it out and hush the crowd you need to get born again you catholic i don't get excited about that i think i think i think it ought to be just the preacher shouldn't get excited maybe just the just the real worshipers people that know how to carry a tune in the bucket let me tell you can i give you some scripture i'm a bible preaching preacher i was told by a critic right here brother andrew you need to learn your bible you know what i did i wouldn't learn my bible like i didn't know it in the first place oh you better be quiet just let the worshipers worship preachers should just preach the word just speak jesus okay ezra 3 and 11 and they sing together sit down they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth forever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praise the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid they all shouted this ain't just for the worshipers verse 12 but many of the priests and levites of the chief of the fathers who were ancient men men that knew how to worship men that had seen the first tabernacle put in place they had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of the joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off don't tell me to be quiet and to go sit down in my pew because if you felt like i felt you'd be shouting to you're talking about a shout that's the only kind that the word can bring forth the modern church don't want it but the bride she knows where she at psalms 5 and 11. you can put it up there but i'm going to give it to you in the passion translation psalms 5 and 11 because people people want their new age bible they don't want that king james version that's too old for them let me give you the passion translation but let all them be glad those who turn aside to hide themselves in you may they keep shouting for joy forever overshadow them in your presence as they sing and rejoice then every lover of your name will burst forth with endless joy may they shout may they keep on shouting forever well i'm going to take a trip on that good old gospel ship i'm not just excited down here it's just a foretaste of what's coming up there i'm not just shouting down here on earth but the bible tells me i will shout for joy forever there's power in your shout out they don't want it because they like living with walls but israel shouted all the israel shouted and walls fell down when jesus was making this triumphal entry into the city when he told his disciples he said over there by that way there's a coat that's tied you go in there and if anybody asks you what you're doing you tell them that the lord has need of them and when they saw this thing that was done on which a coat had never been ridden on the bible said that the disciples came forth shouting with a loud voice praising god for his wondrous works that they had seen and it caused such an uproar like the pharisees and the so-called highfalutin message people of the church said hey why don't you rebuke your disciples for worshiping you like that he said if these hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out i never seen one rock that can sing like i can i ain't never seen one boulder that can roll over and make a joyful noise like i can i'm the only kind that the word can bring forth [Applause] give me psalms 150 ah hallelujah we're the only kind say it to your neighbor we're the only kind that the lord can bring forth praise you the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of a trumpet praise him with a sultry and a harp praise him with a timber and a dance praise him with a string instrument an organs praise him upon the loud sounding symbols praise him on the high sounding symbols let everything that hath breath praise he the lord hallelujah we're the only kind that the world can bring forth this ain't emotion we got something to shout about well so i want to know when it's my time to shout i'm going to tell you it's your time right now i don't know how to do it let me tell you you'll figure it out you'll figure it out it's your time to shout because i want you to know and i wanted to become a revelation to you that your accuser has been defeated and he's laying in the red sea that one that used to whip you the one that used to torment you he's laying dead in the red sea right now is your time look at your neighbor saying now's my time i'm going to enjoy my praise i'm going to enjoy my victory i'm enjoying my shout i'm enjoying my freedom i'm enjoying this message somebody wasn't shouting because of a croc tried to cry out i'm not going to be much longer i'm i'm actually finished but i'm going to give you this i'm going to give you this because this is a bonus you get extra credit for this i need every bit extra credit i can get but you you are you all are very aware you've been to camp meeting a lot most of us most of us leave camp leave town and head down camp meet when it comes and camp meetings coming up the first tuesday in august down brother joe green's church there and they were they were having a camp meeting a few years ago i believe it's 2015. and your pastor was preaching and i was on the pulpit and he got to preaching on a preacher first night on anointing it to carry the scepter you remember and then then then it come it's time to preach again and he started preaching on let them go and he started preaching on moses going down to pharaoh's house and he began to tell them that this was a time sensitive word and brother ron began to say that this is a time-sensitive word and nothing happens by chance and moses was a one-man invasion and he was going down there to deliver and he screamed out let them go let my people go and at that time brother ron i was sitting right behind him me and brother joel were sitting here on the pulpit brother roman was preaching and us preachers sometimes have a hard time keeping our hands in her pocket and brother juan got to preach and he said this is a time sensitive word and nothing happens by chance let them go and brother ron swung his hand he swung his hand and he broke this watch off of his hand i immediately grabbed that but i didn't catch it till later on what had really happened right there he was preaching this is a time-sensitive word and to let them go but at that time the watch broke off of his wrist but not only did it break off but it stopped at that exact time and on the exact date that he was preaching this what was it saying to you satan your time is over hallelujah your time is finished now is the time for the blood of jesus christ to arise up to a rise up micah said rejoice not against me or my enemies when i fall i salarize your time is finished and my time has just begun i'm the only kind that the word can bring forth the church don't run under these acts 238 harlem blabbering screaming acts 2 38 believing people but you are the bride of jesus christ i have just given you your time satan you're finished you're finished your time is over this is the time when time shall be no more and the rapture is at hand hallelujah satan has no hold on you no more cancer can't hold you barriness can't hold you the bride is rising to her feet i am in the vision go to praising god because you're loose [Applause] you don't have a watch but i do you don't have a watch but brother branham told us that god's timepiece is israel and it's marching right on time the accuser of the brethren is cast down and we overcome him by the word of our testimony if you could understand that this is your time this is your time this is your time to receive this this is your time to watch this come to pass you imagine you imagine a shout of the children of israel as they're walking over on dry land they have been let go of everything that they knew they have been let go of the slave master belt they have been let go of the whipping post they have been let go of making sand and making bricks they have been let go and now when they get on the other side there became a shout on the other side what was it the bible said that moses began to break out in the spirit what spirit was that it was the spirit of prophecy that said the horse and his rider has he cast into the sea that song is sung over in the book of revelation that song that is a testimony that there is a people that has come out is being sung in the land you're the people of the open book and the time is at hand god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you god bless you what are you saying that for you're blessed you're the most blessed people that i know the enemy that's held you his time has run out satan you have a time stamp but i don't oh let the singers let the praisers bring me a minstrel i'm not in a bad mood like elijah was but bring me a menstrual you see something happened when elijah began to praise god the vision broke when the atmosphere got right oh my what would happen in this place what would happen right now if you begin to bring a minstrel something you ain't ever brought before the lord a new kind of praise i'm not talking about some kind of new age theology because that ain't gonna work i'm not talking about some contemporary worship but i'm talking about a praise i'm talking about something that can only come forth out of you not out of your neighbor not out of your pastor but something that come out of you because you recognize it's your time if you felt like i felt if you knew like i knew you'd be shouting too if you knew like i know but malachi the night your night comes in your song why don't you go ahead and praise god praise him praise him all your children thank you or said jerusalem was a shaken pentecost had arrived in an upper room chamber they were drunk on the new eye now peter stood among them and said there is no doubt this holy ghost and fire it'll make you dance right now it's just like fire it's just like fire flow shut [Music] he was born to prophesy that prophet jeremiah he would lift his voice and cries we'll be quiet folks commanded go home and leave us the lord but how can you be quiet when the fire is oh shut up in your voice well some people get offended because i dance and shout oh they tell me to be quiet oh sit down in my here but [Music] oh [Music] they say [Music] if oh oh [Music] oh
