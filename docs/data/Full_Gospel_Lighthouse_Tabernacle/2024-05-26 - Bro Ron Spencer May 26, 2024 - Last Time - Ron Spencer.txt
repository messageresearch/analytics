will be here and we've got great attachment to brother Aaron and sister Lydia and he's a phenomenal speaker just phenomenal speaker he's he's one of my favorites so I I kind of injures me a bit cuz I'm going to speak at brother Wayne Lawson's at his meeting next week it'll be my first time back on the field and so you remember us there pray for us that God would be with us and but brother Aaron will be here speaking for you Saturday and Sunday morning and so I know that you're getting ready to be blessed and so amen he's he's such an incredible blessing to the bride around the world and so amen I will be with brother Tim and brother Timothy and brother Wayne Lawson uh for their meeting there and so we're we would like for you to remember us in prayer as well amen good to be here on a Sunday morning what a meeting last night I just I went home and looked over the notes last night and I just thought how can you how can you put that much in one sermon and so that was so powerful brother Andrew and if you haven't got to hear it go back and listen to it it'll be great amen well welcome to Welcome to the service welcome to two weddings today and amen and you never know what all will happen here amen Amen brother Jimmy gave his heart to the Lord last week and and so we're just thankful for that welcome home welcome home amen amen amen I prayed with brother Roger last week after after brother Jimmy and brother Roger just hugged me and hugged me and hugged me and spoke in tongues while he was hugging me and I tell you what it felt like old times all over again and so amen I think God just comes and brings us special moments and we're just so looking for what he has for us today and and it's a it's a Memorial Day weekend and so a lot can be said there but thank you you for being Warriors in this end time age and so amen God bless you God bless you this morning amen if you'll turn with me to St John chapter 17 and verse one John chapter 17 and verse one when I announce my text this morning don't think that I'm preaching for my last time but the Lord dropped this in my heart on the way home Sunday last Sunday last time my mother used to say that to me sometimes I'm going to tell you for the last time yeah I'm going to beat you for the last time and then I thought my Daddy really was it was going to be my last time it didn't hurt me it didn't hurt me and maybe that's not your political view but you probably needed it yourself and didn't get as much as you needed and so that's what's wrong with our generation now amen St John chapter 17 and verse 1 and these words SP Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou has given him and this is life eternal that they may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent I have glorified thee on the earth and I have finished the work which thou gavest to me you may be seated I just want to share this just to to maybe be an encouragement to those that suffer sickness and as many of you know that we are fighting stage for cancer and just had a massive heart attack and then we fight another killer called diabetes and in my diabetes that that I struggle with is my pancreas doesn't work and so and so it uh it was killed by the steroids and the and also the the chemotherapy heart attack was also caused by the chemotherapy so we just kind of walk a very fine line and and I just want to say this to you and I've not said it in this way but it's not something that I worry about it's not something that I lay awake at night thinking of my final end this scripture says that precious a death of a saint is precious in the eyes of the Lord and so what that scripture tells us is your final hours are guarded by the angels of God you cannot go a minute early or a minute late are you with me Stonewall Jack Jackson sat on his horse and on his saddle and right in the midst of a bit and he he they would ask him how do you have that kind of a confidence and he said I'm a safe on the battlefield as I am at home on my pillow now sometimes people take one little pill and it worries them absolutely to death I take 30 every morning and I'm not even concerned say why brother Ron I'm safe in his hands and so when I speak to you this morning on last time don't think for a second that I'm thinking this is going to be my last [Music] sermon can I just get that done real quick and so you don't sit there and get cold on me [Applause] I had to drop that right there before I didn't want nobody get any kind of Illusion here I'm thinking I'm going home well when I go home don't you be crying for me I'm going to be more alive there than ever before and so brother renom would call you as the Bride of Jesus Christ the final Voice final voice to the final age we realize that we're right at the end you a drunk can see this we're at the end of all things we realize that we're literally on the precipice of the tribulation period blending over with what we see now we're in the age of Le oosa where it is a age of people's rights it's an age of expressing one's opinion it's an it's an age of political values all over the place but it's also an age where there's a bride of Jesus Christ that's getting ready so we realize these moments are joining together and we're literally in a in a junction and so as we would say and we say it many times don't miss it whatever you do don't miss it we realize that time intercepts with prophecy God causes men to rise and he causes them to fall whether it's Kings or potentates or popes on the scene many times we say well we vote them in or this one was selected God causes men to rise and he causes men to fall you can read the book of Daniel that points that out we realize realiz that we're under the pressure of the darkness of of this age and the pressure of almost a chaos but in the middle of all of this chaos God's Diamonds shine throughout the darkness we are not disappointed we're not disillusioned we've heard a message and this message is not just to America it's all over the Earth so it's not just a little bit group of people but there's a bride all over the earth that is gathered to hear his voice what I find it's very interesting is that no matter where you go the nature of the people have the same that it is right here so the Holy Ghost is not an American holy ghost or a Russian holy ghost or a European Holy Ghost ghost now we realize there's people that are more more vocal or more lively or quieter but it's the same Holy Ghost now we realize that this this is not an accident that you just fall into it understand that you being here and I know you fight the enemy but you being here that you're a literal physical thought or an act attribute of God that he thought up before the foundation of the world are you with me so when Satan tells you God don't love you remind him of where God thought of you before there was ever an earth or a sun or moon and stars God thought of you then so when God thinks of you he don't unthink of you that doesn't give us a license to live any way that we want to live that gives us confidence that we can live in the wickness of Ages and still overcome [Applause] Hallelujah it incredible we can still overcome no matter what is against us no matter how much pressure it is against us God has a prepared and equipped you I love that don't you Psalms chapter 27 and verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation and Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh and stumbled and they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should arise against me in this will I be confident what an incredible statement Wars th troubles on every side but in this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all that days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple read this next verse with me for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle he shall hide me and he shall set me upon a rock oh what a rock that it is Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 5 I want you to read this with me too but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are [Applause] healed oh don't you love it we realize that we have arrived at the end time bride's Revival is continuing to go on and it cannot be stopped it's been since the days of Acts chapter 2 in the period of of the pillar of fire came amongst the church and all the ages could not stop the Revival because it was Christ walking through the candlesticks what God starts no devil in hell can stop there's not a devil that's big enough to stop what God starts and if I can say that about you what God placed on the inside of you is part of himself and there's not a devil in hell big enough to stop the god that is inside of [Applause] you Hallelujah if I can say this greater is he that is in you go ahead and point it right there this is not about your 200 lb flesh or 6' five flesh or 5 foot five flesh or 110 pounds I'll find you somewhere another it's not about your flesh or your feelings or your memories or your affection it's about that Eternal part that he put in you before the foundation of the world that seed Gene of life that God put there God's Got Confidence in what he deposited on the inside of you it will not fail governments can fail Wars can cause failure schools can fall apart churches can fall apart but the seed of God that he put on the inside of you has got failure anywhere inside of [Applause] it when I speak about last time God writes it in his prophetic word but Satan cannot open up the word and reveal it to himself he he can see it coming and he can't stop it let me give you an example in Exodus 3 and verse four and when the Lord saw that and that he had turned aside to see God God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither and put off thy shoes from off of thy feet for the place whereupon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of the thy father and the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their Taskmaster for I know their sorrows notice these words I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of the out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land of flowing with milk and honey unto a place of the Canaanites and the he titites and the amorites and the pites and the hites and the jebusites now won you just understand he's on the backs side of a desert on a on a mountain region and God is having a conference with his prophet and he's telling him you're going to be a oneman Invasion into Egypt and more than just a onean Invasion I'm going to go with you Hallelujah get that you're not going by yourself I'm going with you it's a great big difference when God's with you in the car with you in your house he's with you on your job now I want you to understand the whole world didn't understand this this happened on the back side of a desert but if we could tell Egypt in that day they were still building armies they were still building uh pyramids they were still at work they were still having their schools going on and and and they were still Gathering their taxes and Gathering all their money they were still beating the the Israel the Jewish slaves they were still going all that but listen God had made a pronouncement on the backside of this mountain Egypt is coming to its last [Applause] day it's coming to its last days I've had enough I've had enough I've seen the cries I've seen the cries I'm going to come and and take my word that I have promised and I'm going to fulfill it that's right now I want you to understand in this 24hour period cycle God was now starting a cycle that every devil in in Egypt couldn't stop now it's easy for us to amen that this morning cuz we know what happened a one man Invasion and God walked into the greatest army the greatest civilization there was and took over and took the greatest army that there was and crushed them and drowned them in the same water that he delivered the Jewish Nation Iran ought to read the book those Nations surrounding Israel needs to read the book if God is on your side if God is on your side if God is on your side there's not an army big enough Hallelujah there's not an army big enough to take back what God gave to [Applause] you are you kind of getting my thoughts now now America is also in the same thoughts America's going on America's in the industrialization we've come from agriculture then industrialization then we see we see the Great Depression we have wars phenomenal Wars difficult Wars and incredible loss of life so that we can remain a free Nation but God's going to send a messenger to this generation is not going to be hooked to any denomination so he not going to be some man-made deal it's going to be a godm made deal now we're going on brother random don't understand his ministry maybe this is the first time that you've heard these things but don't let it choke you brother brandham goes to pray about some things and and he's in a cave and there was a man stepped into the cave he would be a a darker complected Angel of the Lord about six foot tall dark complected he would be a man that would have dark shoulder length hair and he would begin to speak to him that that I'm sent from the presence of the Lord fear not and then he begins to tell him of his Commission on the earth that how he would go around the world and and he would he would preach around the world and and how that God would be with him and the angel would be with him brother Brandon would give him his excuses and I'm not an eloquent speaker I I can't do this I'm you know he's a Kentucky guy he's a he's a HomeTown in Indiana guy and he's he's he's got a lot of he's got a lot of uh he's got a lot of things in his own psyche that uh that he has difficult with and so how how can I do this and God tells him I'm going to be with you give you sign in your hand and then it it would evolve can I just kind of say this after I've said this about Egypt America didn't know what was getting ready to happen to heren the church world didn't know what was getting ready to happen to her war was about to break out in the spiritual World they had just saw ausa Street and they had just saw that movement of God pouring out his gifts now at the same time that brother brandom comes on the scene there's going to become other powerful men on the scene Oral Roberts will be birthed under his ministry Billy Graham will come on the scene 1946 Billy Graham's largest meeting Los Angeles will come on the scene and if you go back and listen as I've listened to Billy Graham's initial sermons let me talk to you just a moment they wouldn't allow those kind of sermons to be preached the pastor of America would not allow be allowed to preach moral code that Billy Graham [Music] preached but it's still right can we say it's still right he preached he preached against divorce he he preached against he he preached against homosexuality listen he did let me just lay it out to you he preached the moral fiber of the scriptures and he preached that you must be born again and he preached against this this this age of becoming that you're all gods you just do anything that you want to do he would say there's only one God why are you saying that brother Ron people can stand up in this generation and just talk just a simple level of more morality and there comes a back flood against them there comes a back flood against it it shows how dark that this age [Applause] is can you imagine brother brandham standing on a world stage and preaching Jezebel religion hybrid religion indictment are you with me and knoweth it not these powerful grit sermons that's calling a bride out of denominations come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her plagues this voice was more than the voice of a man listen he wasn't God but he represented God amen are you with me and he stood there as a voice in this generation to call you out because you are so important let me just stop here for a moment brother metas would you please stand have him to stand please stand yes brother meadas would it be his his cousin Freeman met us Freeman all right thank you you can be seated brother Matos Freeman Matos was a part of the Full Gospel businessman as a matter of fact he was more powerful probably than most of this audience knows but he was a man that was responsible to get brother brandham here in 19 58 and he was personal friends help me I've just lost his name um no I'm looking for I'm looking for the name in in C in Arizona Carl Williams Carl Williams father and Carl Williams was a part of the Full Gospel businessman and what they set up was chapters to where that brother brandham wasn't welcome to go to the denominational churches so they brought it out to where that brother brandham would be accepted speaker to where that he would have a platform to where he could speak in those times AA Allen or Roberts even Billy Graham spoke in those circles some of the greatest speakers spoke in that Circle but the main one was for brother brandham to speak in those circles he'd be the main speaker because of the healing campaigns and so so Carl Williams was friends with Freeman M Meadows and so and so anyway he was responsible to get brother brandham here sometimes we forget the roots of why we are where we are I got a reason to do this now I want you to think of how well we're represented here brother brandham spoke the 1958 meetings to start with the week before he spoke one mile from here at the Pentecostal Church they turned him down because he wore a wrist watch and they called him worly because he wore a wristatch I'm not throwing a rock but somebody's going to be responsible when brother brandham tells the story of Three Squirrels and there's no squirrels to be had he's hunting in a place called Sportsman holler and brother br's a nervous person and he said there's just no squirrels here and God asked him where are you hunting at he said Sportsman holler what do you want three squirrels and now it's going to go to a higher level of speaking into existence where would you you want them at and he begins to explain where he would want them at and he would they would appear and he would shoot him and then there he would realize Visions don't bleed that's right brother Homer Frasier is the one that founded this church along with other great men yeah I need to drink that coke and so it'll be okay it'll be okay I'm fighting a real devil this ain't Hollywood and so he's with Charlie Cox now I think this is pretty interesting brother Ron you'll think this is interesting your grandfather introduced brother brandham to brother Frasier ain't

not throwing no rocks at him but he he chewed tobacco and he went into the meeting and he said I want the Holy Ghost and our Prophet told him he said now if you'll take that tobacco out of the inner layer of your of your pants God will give you the Holy Ghost I find it interesting I want you to just stand now brother Chris brother Chris is it in your business office the table in your basement brother Chris has the table that was in brother Charlie Cox's that they ate those squirrels off of so if you ever have a question about those squirrels he's got the table and and I heard Charlie say

thank you well it worked God ordained brother Chris and his family to be here he ordained The Frasier family to be here but more than any of your family name are you with me now let me come on more than any of your family given family name the seed that he put here he areain you to be [Applause] here why hasn't the Rapture happened sooner we had to wait on you I'm looking for you Adam why didn't you get married sooner you had to wait on her to grow up I got meaning with this if you'd have married her when she was 12 you'd have been old enough but Jim would have killed you [Applause] well why didn't the Rapture happen in 77 we wasn't here [Applause] yet are you with me how many was born after 1977 kids I'll give this back to you for I'll knock it over God's not going to take it well brother Ron but it's it's seems like we're well overdue that's the way it seems to you but I'm sure Paul's people felt the same way I'm sure iren's people felt the same way I'm sure Columbus Fel people felt the same way I'm preaching to you I'm sure Wesley's people felt the same way way when's he going to come it can't come now but neither can one bomb drop on America until we're gone [Applause] oh brother R I don't know when let me just say Los Angeles will drop at the right time don't lay awake nervous if you're the seed of God don't we don't worry about Russia don't worry about communism don't worry about who's getting voted next next year in and how the economy is going to be don't worry about none of that are you with me just put yourself under the token and say God fill my life like never before I want to make sure I'm in right in the middle of the will of [Applause] God so let's just think about it America you're at your end and he saying that in 1946 and America was going on and she's still going going on but just like The Exodus we're coming to that moment we're coming to that moment we're coming to that moment well just in case the devil has forgotten i' like to just I would like to just remind you that we as a people will continue to worship no matter what the pressures are I'm going to speak a few just a couple moments on David and David would write some phenomenal some phenomenal songs but at the climax of some of his writings he was responsible for writing some things and can I just read read some of them to you just now and maybe you can put that up Psalms 150 get ready for it now he's not writing this to an Isuzu group he's not writing this to an emotional group he's not writing this just to the bride group he's writing this all the way down well brother Ron y'all read this because you're emotional you're not getting a picture we are only a part of a people since David release this that have enjoyed these scriptures and we can understand our Liberty so let let me just go through it praise ye the Lord praise God in his Sanctuary are you getting it Praise Him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him to his according uh excellent greatness Praise Him him with a sound of a trumpet praise him with a saucery and a harp praise him with a timberl and a dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs Praise Him upon loud symbols and praise Him upon High sounding symbols am I reading this to the right group let everything that hath breath praise the [Applause] Lord I will give you license not to praise God oh come on if they're dead and I'm not talking about spiritually dead I'm talking about dead d e a d they can put a knife in you they can shoot you they can they can say all manner against you but you're dead so you are responsible you do you do not have license to not worship God in Psalms chapter 100 Make a Joyful Noise under the Lord all your lands all your lands all your lands serve the Lord with gladness and come before me with a presence with singing know you that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us not we ourselves we are his people and sheep of his pasture enter to into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good and his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth is enduring to

Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in a dance let them sing praises unto him with a timble and a harp for the lord taketh pleasure in his people am for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand [Applause] Psalms 103 and verse one bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefit oh I love this who forgiveth all of thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies you know there's two sides to every story there two sides to every story most time people want to tell the side that's their story and they feel convinced that they're right they're right they're right they're right they're right what they really need to do is go get on their knees let me tell you about a pastor a pastor is a guy that listen he'll listen to a a woman he'll listen to a man both of them got your stories there's a right side a left side and God's side amen I'm right brother Ron God's right amen and most of the time you can tell where who's right by attitude that's free that's free that's free two sides we all Rejoice with David going down and picking up five smooth Stones j s u s f AI t h not going too much further because I'll go four letters or a little boy that had killed a lion and killed a bear who refused to take Saul's armor and go because that slink God had anointed him and listen this Goliath was no bigger or no more wicked than the line or the bear Goliath was only the next victim you fought a lot of demons in your life and the one that's getting ready to fight you this week if he only knew he's only the next [Applause] victim so let's just flip the story here let's go to the other side Goliath would get up in the morning he would go out and scream at the Israelites they were backslid in their condition they didn't have a man that could meet the challenge of the hour Hey listen he's protected as long as there's nobody that will come and he could scream and scream and scream and scream about the God of Israel's dead and your God's asleep he's on a vacation and he could scream I'm the Champion I'm the Champion now no doubt that he had some people that just ADM admired him oh they admired how big he was how strong he was how much muscle that he had how much that he could carry how much that his armor weighed how big his helmet was if I could only be like Goliath but Goliath was headed for his last day because his Daddy had said will you take some snacks over to the boys now goliath was not there but his last day was now tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick Satan listen to that your last Day's coming Goliath got up this morning and he stretched oh he stretched I bet that big old guy could stretch and he stretched stretch touch his toes time for breakfast I believe I'll have 12 eggs amen probably it was a special cook assigned to him whole loaf of bread people watched him as he ate and they didn't realize he's eating for the last time yes this is his last day and no matter how much you admire him this is his last day and if you know anything about the Scriptures it says that a living dog is is greater than a king a dead King a living dog well brother Ron I'm the least in the Kingdom you don't realize you are greater than Abraham Lincoln you're greater than George Washington you're greater than all the Dead Presidents cuz their job is done and you still got work to do no matter how much money Howard Hughes had he's dead maybe some of your favorite movie stars they're gone they won't do another movie it's over with Marilyn Monroe it's over with [Music] he started putting his on his armor no way could he realize is today is my last day pretty sober and if he could have thought about it today's my last day but no he was a champion and he walked out there with all the confidence that Humanity could have and he be to scream and if he could look and if his eyes could look through his shield and see down over there there's a little bitty boy getting ready to end his clock of course we know the end of that story as he walked down he made all the brags that he could oh yeah now what you just think about this just for a little bit God will put you in a spot you say brother Ron I don't know when the Rapture is going to happen I don't know when the resurrection can happen listen if you was in the fox holes listen if David loses you're going to be slaves they're going to take your wives and they're going to take your children you better trust God you better have confidence in his testimony you better know this message is right [Applause] you got to look in the eyes of every devil in hell and say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them can I share with you one more story this morning before I quit there was a girl that was an orphan and she was working in on her her uncle's place he was the foreman of the ranch he had a lot of daughters but since she was orphan she had no rights to the family values or the family tradition and so she cooked she cleaned she did all the Dirty Jobs she was not looked at on the same level as everybody else has looked at and so one day the armor and son would come from Chicago now he's looking for a wife sure there's plently women in Chicago but he's looking for a wife with character hadn't been able to find it where he was at listen it's character is not bought it's not sold it's not developed it's real and he was looking for a real queen for his home and so the armor and Company son has made his his pilgrimage to the to this Ranch and so they have a dance for him all the daughters of the of the and the ladies of the Society of that neighborhood they was all dressed up they was all ready to go they was all happy that he's there one of them may be the next the wife of this this incredible rich boy they put on the dog but when he looked around he saw just what he saw in Chicago so he took a breath of fresh air and he walked out to the Corral and as he's standing there there was a girl that so happened to be the orphan child came out and dumped the dishwater and he began to talk to her listen to her story she was in bare feet you've heard this story hundreds of times and he talked to her he told her his his intentions he told her what he was there looking for she knew those things but now he's telling her now it's not about 50 other girls it's about her this sermon is about you amen can I say it it's about you so go ahead and take it personal was brother brandom the first to tell the story no no no no Dwight Moody told the story but when brother Brandon picked it up he realized that he was getting the bride for Jesus Christ in the last day and so he told it personal to where you would catch it amen then he would preach choosing of a bride and talk about your character what God was looking for and lay it all just right and now here you are amen now you it's incredible she's standing here alone with him and he's telling her the story and now it's a story that's so believable it changes her life it's not this is not Disney World it's not not Cinderella listen it becomes so convincing until the next 24 hours she's changed it wasn't like the previous 24 hours she's changed and he seals his story with a kiss on her cheek when she goes back inside he goes about his way and he makes her a promise I'll be back for you I'll be back for you now you know it's kind of like Jesus said tell this to no man I always think that's one of the most comical things he tells it don't tell this to nobody cuz he knows human nature now I'm going to catch you all I heard a secret yesterday it's burning so much in my belly I can't keep this to yourself I I got to tell you a secret don't tell us to nobody I know something that nobody else knows and your ears go boo now she goes back in and how how was how was the dinner last night how was the dance ah he's just come through he didn't pay us no attention he's gone he did me I spent some time around the Corral with him and he kissed me on the cheek he did what your silly little girl hallucinating your dreaming yeah baby she knew it was real she was there when it happened she heard it when he whispered in her ear she knew she knew she knew she knew she knew I think it's fascinating for about a year she starts working on a dress they laugh they they say everything against her and at the same time that she's working on her dress she's making their dinner and she's making their beds and she's she's doing her clothes she's doing everything and she's get she's doing all this cuz she's living in Two Worlds she's getting ready for a Rapture oh I'm sorry she's getting ready for a marriage and and yet she's doing these worldly things down there that she has to take care of and she does that for weeks and months and and the Cycle's getting closer he made a promise one year and I'm sure she exed off on the calendar and it comes down to the last week and today is the last day last day am when she got up this morning she cooked eggs last time last time she washed the dishes last time she cleaned her clothes last time she swept the floor last [Applause] time you've had some last times the last time you had a cigarette the last time that you went to that porn habit the last last time Satan I'm done it's over it's over over it's over it's over it's over I'm not your slave no more it's the last time I'm done with you last time last time go ahead and tell the devil it's a last time Satan it's over Satan it's you're through [Applause] today she hung her apron up last time she took her work dress off and hung it on her nail last time and she put her wedding dress on and she pulled it up real tight and then she pulled it up tighter and then she pulled it up tighter and she put the strings in the spot she pulled it and she pulled it she let all the air go out of her belly she stood and she looked in the mirror and everything she had been dreaming at she was looking cuz the dress perfectly fit the message fit just right it fit just right all those tapes and all those sermons and all of those preaching all of those dancing in the aisle and paying off today it's paid off today she's looked up in the mirror and she's not graded no longer and she don't need her glasses no longer didn't say it mine are real didn't say it she I don't know what they're going to do with all this metal that's in our bodies somewhere it's going to be left here those guys that are in the metal industry I don't know what they'll do they'll go ahead and get that I guess I ain't going to be here either baby they can have they can have whatever they want and she walked out she walked out on the porch and there was all of those crazy cousins laughing those crazy denominations laughing go ahead and laugh go ahead and laugh baby go ahead and laugh it's your last laugh go ahead and make fun of us it's is your last laugh I'm sorry I actually feel sorry for you let's just say she walks down to the picked fence and there's a little gate there and she opens it up and she steps through it she ain't going back cuz ain't nothing there to go back to and they laugh and they make all the kind of fun and they're standing there and they're doing everything that they can do to discourage her but she knows she was the one that got the kiss you know where was at an altar in a car in your bedroom wherever it was you're the one that got that Holy Ghost kiss that came down and it was just different from that day forward it was just different [Applause] and all of a sudden there was something in the wind that was just a little bit different and if you could hear really good you could hear horses feet clopping and coming across the ridge this just was no ordinary buggy this is the buggy the buggy this ain't no just ordinary Resurrection this is the resurrection this isn't just an ordinary Rapture this is the [Applause] rapture as he slips across the hill and he comes back down he comes right up to where she's standing at and he reaches down and he pulls her up on the on the wagon and he begins to tell her I've been watching you the whole time I've had somebody watching you the whole time and you did real well now if I can just put my part in here just for a moment look at that house for your last time it's it's over it's over David it's over it's over it's over Timothy EV it's over one of these mornings this not an illusion amen it's over

another and you actually figure out who each other is brother Andrew will you pray for us today Father we come to you just now in this moment Lord a predestinated moment that you have set up before the foundation of the world you see our brother Benjamin and sister Rebecca today as they've come to make their wedding vows renewed father Lord we understand that by the message of the hour they feel like are one now so father according to their faith and their change of heart according to this message we ask God that you would pour out your blessings upon each of them in their home Lord as they've come under the shadow of the wings of the most high God I pray that you would bless their marriage like never before so God we ask that you'd come today in Jesus name amen amen brother Benjamin will you have this woman to be your wife to live together in the Holy Covenant of marriage will you love her comfort her honor her and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful to her as long as the both of you shall live if so answer I will sister Rebecca will you have this man to be your husband to live together in the Holy Covenant of marriage will you love him comfort him honor and keep him in sickness and in health forsaking all others and be faithful to him as long as the both of you shall live if so answer I will Hallelujah I'm the emot one today marriage is a gift of God it's marriage is the comfort of life life is tough especially when you're walking alone but when both of you are have Jesus Christ as the middle of your marriage it can be a place to where it's a sanctuary from this world marriage is a clasping of hands it's a blending of Hearts it's the union of two lives becoming one your marriage must not stand by the authority of a state nor by the Seal of your wedding certificate but rather it must stand in your strength of your love and must stand in your devotion and to one another in good and in bad times finally it must stand because of God's participation in your marriage marriage can be the greatest relationship that you will ever experience however it marriage to reach his full potential potential you must allow God to be play its primary role in your relationship he knows your thoughts he knows your needs he understands your hearts and yet Your Love even for one another in fact it is what God created marriage took place in the Garden of Eden and what a canopy of the first marriage ceremony that it was Jesus attended also a feast if you remember they ran out of wine it was a good place for a first miracle at a marriage today could be a miracle for you guys you remember they ran out of wine and they went to the right one Jesus were out of wine he said Gather barrels and fill them with water there's no way that man could do this but he went in where the barrels were and when he finished today he took water and made it the best wine ever even to which that the guest at the wedding said you saved the best wine for the for the last I think today is even a better part of your marriage that Jesus entered into your home in a more Supernatural way than ever before I think as I stand here and fill the spirit of the Lord moving through my body I know that he is sanctioning this event in an incredible way today as we say these vows again I want you to mean them from your heart like never
