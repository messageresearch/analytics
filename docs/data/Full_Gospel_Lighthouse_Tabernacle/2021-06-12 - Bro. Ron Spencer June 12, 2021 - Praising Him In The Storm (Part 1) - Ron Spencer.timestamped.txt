[37:28] we so love you with all of our hearts

[37:33] sister ruth and they have at our
[37:35] graduation and so we're just
[37:37] we're proud that our buddy has graduated
[37:40] michael has graduated and
[37:42] wow how time flew amen feels like only a
[37:45] few days ago we were dedicating him to
[37:47] the lord and so
[37:48] time just goes so it's like a vapor and
[37:51] it just
[37:52] goes and it just passes by us and so
[37:55] amen sister mary we sure have been
[37:57] praying for you today
[37:59] losing a good friend like sister hope
[38:02] for those i don't know how many of you
[38:04] would remember sister hope but
[38:07] her husband and her were two of the
[38:08] sweetest people on earth and so
[38:11] amen so we want to pray for the family
[38:14] there
[38:15] and then they have adopted some girls
[38:17] and there's
[38:18] quite a situation with all of that so i
[38:20] would ask you that you would remember
[38:22] them in prayer
[38:23] and that god would just be with them in
[38:26] a special way
[38:28] amen that god would touch them we lost a
[38:30] special preacher this week
[38:32] and that was that was brother ernie
[38:34] villanueva
[38:35] i mean to remember brother ernie amen
[38:38] ernie
[38:39] ernie was around here many years ago i
[38:42] knew him
[38:43] i knew him since a young man and so i
[38:46] think brother tim pruitt actually
[38:48] actually prayed him through to the holy
[38:50] ghost and so
[38:51] he said i held him till he got it
[38:55] amen and so amen so we love brother
[38:58] ernie brother ernie was probably the
[39:00] most
[39:00] powerful positive speaker that i ever
[39:04] was and he was a motivational speaker as
[39:06] well
[39:06] in the work realm and uh and he
[39:10] actually was quite quite a friend to
[39:11] ours to our family
[39:13] my mother enjoyed feeding him gravy and
[39:16] biscuits
[39:17] and he would he was the kind of fella
[39:18] that you could just take into your home
[39:20] and just enjoy it
[39:21] and he was always so cordial and so nice
[39:24] and so
[39:25] uh we he he is
[39:28] at a great reunion now amen and so
[39:32] i'm sure he's done shook my mom's hand
[39:34] and brother homer's hand
[39:35] and telling them how everything's going
[39:38] on down here so
[39:39] so we certainly will miss brother ernie
[39:42] and he
[39:43] is getting his reward even now and so
[39:46] and many more rewards to come i find
[39:49] this interesting that
[39:50] i i kind of keep certain things this is
[39:54] the first
[39:54] note that brother ernie ever sent me
[39:59] amen and i would say that's about 30
[40:02] years ago
[40:03] and so i want to read it for you tonight
[40:06] in his behalf and so that's all right
[40:08] it's two pieces of it didn't and so
[40:12] and you'll remember you'll notice this
[40:13] one real quickly it had effect on me
[40:16] if god is your partner you better have
[40:19] big plans
[40:21] d.l moody is the one that spoke that
[40:23] sermon and so
[40:25] amen i've been blessed by it by that
[40:28] thought so many times
[40:29] because it's a reality to me
[40:33] the next note that he sent me he's he
[40:36] said this prayer takes about one minute
[40:39] pray it sincerely and then those who you
[40:42] send it to
[40:43] pray have them to pray for you believe
[40:46] it
[40:46] and receive it it's a powerful prayer
[40:50] and when you're down to nothing god is
[40:52] up to something
[40:55] father in the name of jesus bless
[40:58] me even while i'm reading this prayer
[41:02] and bless the one that sent this to me
[41:05] in a very special way open supernatural
[41:09] doors in our lives

[42:45] right here in the storm
[42:49] hallelujah we will praise him
[42:52] in the midst of this storm amen had a
[42:56] wonderful day today had a miserable one

[43:40] amen i hope you enjoy that so amen
[43:44] amen god bless those people that's like
[43:45] a second home to me
[43:47] matthew chapter 8 and verse 23
[43:52] amen and when he had entered into a ship
[43:55] his disciples followed him
[43:58] and behold there are rows of great
[44:00] tempters in the sea
[44:01] in so much that the ship was covered
[44:04] with the waves
[44:07] but he was asleep and the disciples came
[44:11] to him and woke him
[44:13] saying lord save us
[44:17] we perish and he saith unto them
[44:22] why are ye fearful
[44:26] o ye of little faith
[44:30] then he arose and rebuked the winds and
[44:32] the seas and there
[44:33] was a great calm but the men
[44:37] marveled saying what manner
[44:41] of a man is this
[44:44] that even the winds and the seas
[44:48] obey him amen
[44:51] may the lord bless the reading of his
[44:53] word and you may be seated
[44:55] this evening
[45:04] now christians aren't the only ones that
[45:06] get storms
[45:10] hallelujah just waiting on you to settle
[45:13] in
[45:13] christians are not the only one to get
[45:15] storms
[45:17] it's not a new thing for you to get
[45:20] storms
[45:22] you just expected it when you were a
[45:24] sinner
[45:27] you kind of expected you reap what you
[45:29] sow
[45:30] i'm not doing well and so these things
[45:33] are going to come
[45:34] but after you become a christian
[45:36] sometimes you think well
[45:38] i shouldn't be getting this kind of a
[45:39] storm in my life
[45:41] this shouldn't be going on i'm doing
[45:42] good i'm serving the lord
[45:44] but what you realize that there was a
[45:46] time in your life
[45:48] that you were swimming with the with the
[45:50] river
[45:52] but when you become a christian you turn
[45:54] around
[45:56] and the waves sometimes seem to be
[45:58] bigger and stronger
[46:00] and the wind sometimes they seem to be a
[46:02] whole lot more august to it
[46:04] but i want you to understand even a
[46:07] sleeping jesus
[46:09] [Music]
[46:12] hallelujah even asleep in jesus is
[46:15] greater than the storm
[46:17] [Applause]
[46:18] hallelujah we preached so many times
[46:21] that we go wake him we go waking go wake
[46:23] him go wake him he's in the boat with
[46:25] you
[46:26] but if you will notice jesus reminds
[46:28] them
[46:30] you're of a little faith those storms
[46:33] couldn't have done anything to you
[46:36] because i was in the ship
[46:39] so even a sleeping tired wore out jesus
[46:42] is more
[46:43] greater than your biggest storm
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] say well i haven't heard from him i
[46:49] haven't dreamed about him i haven't got
[46:51] a word from the lord
[46:52] i haven't got anything come my way is he
[46:54] anywhere
[46:55] is he 10 million miles away let me just
[46:58] say
[46:58] he's in the boat you didn't get in the
[47:02] storm that he didn't see
[47:04] coming he made a provision for you
[47:06] you'll get out of it
[47:10] he made a promise i'll never leave you
[47:14] i'll never forsake you i'll be
[47:18] with you to the end of the world
[47:21] i'll take his word i'll take his word
[47:23] every time
[47:25] matthew chapter 14 and verse 22
[47:29] and straightway jesus come constrained
[47:32] his disciples to get into the ship
[47:35] and to go before him into the other side
[47:38] while he sent the multitude away
[47:42] and when he had sent the multitudes away
[47:44] he went up into a mountain apart to pray
[47:46] and when evening was come he was left
[47:48] there alone
[47:50] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[47:52] sea tossed
[47:54] with waves for the wind was contrary
[47:59] and the fourth watch of the night jesus
[48:01] went into went
[48:03] unto them walking on the sea
[48:06] and when the disciples saw him walking
[48:08] on the sea they were troubled
[48:10] saying it is a spirit
[48:14] and they cried out for fear but
[48:17] straightway
[48:18] jesus spoke to them
[48:21] saying be of good cheer
[48:24] it is i be not afraid
[48:29] i don't mind telling you when he speaks
[48:31] it sure calms my heart
[48:36] and peter answered him and said lord if
[48:39] it be thou
[48:41] bid me to come into the water
[48:48] come on unto thee on the water and he
[48:51] said come
[48:53] on and when peter was come down out of
[48:57] the ship he walked out on the water to
[48:59] go to jesus
[49:02] but when he saw the wind blusterous
[49:06] he was afraid and beginning to sink
[49:11] he cried saying lord
[49:14] save me you don't have to pray
[49:17] 52 minutes sometimes you don't have it
[49:22] and then immediately jesus stretched
[49:24] forth his hand and caught him
[49:27] and said unto him thou a little faith
[49:31] almost repeating words that they had
[49:33] heard before
[49:35] how much god could say to us tonight
[49:38] ron have more faith
[49:44] have no faith now oh thou have a little
[49:47] faith
[49:48] wherefore didest thou doubt
[49:51] and when they come into the ship the
[49:53] wind ceased
[49:56] and they were in the ship and came and
[49:57] worshiped him saying
[49:59] of a truth thou art the son of god
[50:04] i think after our storm many times
[50:06] that's when we can stop and praise him
[50:10] but god wants praise in the middle of
[50:13] your storm
[50:15] now to back that up let's just turn to
[50:18] uh james chapter
[50:19] one and verse two and i i just want to
[50:23] i want to lay a foundation this evening
[50:24] for tomorrow and
[50:26] and i believe we're going to have a good
[50:27] time this weekend my brethren counted
[50:30] all joy
[50:32] when you fall into divers temptations
[50:37] hallelujah really difficult to do
[50:41] it's mind-boggling for you to do because
[50:43] it's not in your nature
[50:45] when you're having trouble to praise him
[50:49] it's not in your humanity when things
[50:52] are gloomy
[50:53] looking bad you're getting bad reports
[50:57] things are going wrong
[51:01] you'll blame the doctor you'll blame the
[51:03] teachers you'll blame everybody around
[51:05] you
[51:06] where did i sin where did i fail you
[51:08] didn't get enough you didn't get a
[51:10] letter from god telling you the storm
[51:12] was coming
[51:13] but now you find yourself in it and
[51:16] instead of
[51:17] whining and bellyaching and
[51:21] i've got it worse than any other human
[51:23] beings ever had it in my life and
[51:25] you know
[51:30] knowing this that the trine of your
[51:33] faith worth the
[51:34] patience god said it's going to make a
[51:37] way
[51:39] but sometimes you've got to wait and
[51:41] your faith is going to put to a test
[51:47] we as a body of believers i'm getting
[51:49] ready for go to major scans on monday
[51:51] we as a body of believers are looking
[51:53] every time we go to the cancer center
[51:55] to hear the words zero cancer
[51:59] that's the final report that's what
[52:01] we're believing for
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:11] but i don't fall apart when they tell me
[52:14] that it's still
[52:14] active and it's growing i don't fall
[52:16] apart
[52:18] i don't fall apart when they tell me
[52:20] that it's affected another organ or
[52:22] affected this or
[52:23] it's killed this organ or it's destroyed
[52:26] that organ
[52:27] i don't fall apart because i realize
[52:29] there's an in-report that i'm going to
[52:31] get
[52:34] are you with me doctors are there to
[52:36] help me through the trial and help me
[52:38] brother brown said he believed in
[52:40] doctors he said do you trust them
[52:43] he said take their medicine amen i'd
[52:46] like to thank the lord that my
[52:47] medicine's been paid for for the rest of
[52:49] this year
[52:50] that's 30 000 a month i thank god for
[52:53] that miracle
[53:02] two weeks ago they called me and asked
[53:04] for a credit card one of the pharmacists
[53:06] called me and said
[53:07] the pharmacist somewhere another and
[53:09] they call me said we need your credit
[53:10] card said
[53:11] we're charging 23 000 for the medicine
[53:14] that we're getting ready to send you and
[53:15] i said i'm not paying it
[53:17] come on i said they're gonna pay for it
[53:19] and i i don't need to pay for it they're
[53:21] gonna pay for it for me
[53:23] they did it last year they'll pay for me
[53:25] for me and and he and he spent about a
[53:27] half an hour on the phone
[53:29] trying to convince me we've already
[53:30] filled it this i said listen
[53:32] i i don't have to pay for it it's paid
[53:34] for for men
[53:38] they hadn't approved it but i was
[53:40] speaking by faith
[53:44] are you with me listen it sometimes your
[53:47] burden seems pretty
[53:48] serious right in front of you but you
[53:50] don't have to receive the devil's report
[53:55] no i'm not going to go along with that
[53:57] are you with me now
[53:59] he told me that but this is your
[54:01] property you're you're owed i said i'm
[54:03] not paying you
[54:07] so this week when i got it in the mail
[54:09] free
[54:11] i thanked him who's the great doctor
[54:15] [Applause]
[54:22] himself
[54:24] but let patience have her perfect works
[54:26] for for
[54:28] that you may be perfect and entire one
[54:30] and nothing
[54:32] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[54:35] god
[54:36] that giveth to all men liberally
[54:41] and abrade it not and it shall be given
[54:44] him
[54:45] let me just say this to you sometimes
[54:47] you don't have an answer
[54:49] god's always got one
[54:54] he's always got the answer for you
[54:59] but let him ask in faith not wavering
[55:02] for he that wavers is like a wave of the
[55:05] sea
[55:06] driven with the wind and tossed
[55:11] and let not that man think that he shall
[55:14] receive
[55:15] anything from the from the lord a
[55:18] double-minded man
[55:20] is unstable in all his
[55:23] ways that's the reason why
[55:27] i have always spoke to you with what the
[55:29] prophet said
[55:30] never think a negative thought
[55:34] going to come through your mind but you
[55:35] don't have to harbor them you don't have
[55:36] to marry them
[55:37] don't let them become a part of you
[55:41] we should have a great expectation
[55:44] let me just say this to you and this
[55:46] might be of a help this is just free to
[55:48] you this is a 30 year old note on top of
[55:50] a 30 year old note
[55:53] if you live in negativity
[55:57] you will live a negative life
[56:02] if you expect defeat
[56:05] failure will always be at your door
[56:10] you do not have to accept mediocrity
[56:18] you don't have to failure does not have
[56:20] to be
[56:22] your epitaph on your tombstone
[56:29] come on church
[56:35] so many people are always looking at the
[56:37] negative side
[56:40] oh that hit a nail
[56:45] they're always wanting to you know when
[56:47] prayer requests go across this pulpit
[56:50] and i was just sharing this just earlier
[56:52] prayer of course go across the pulpit
[56:54] pray for me the doctors are looking at
[56:56] something and they're looking
[56:58] and they're looking and they're looking
[56:59] and they're looking hey listen
[57:01] i've already got the worst report that
[57:03] you can get
[57:07] so nothing that they can say monday is
[57:09] going to affect me
[57:13] if i can feel this good in this storm
[57:17] just wait till the storm is over with
[57:29] [Applause]
[57:31] [Music]
[57:38] hallelujah
[57:40] i realize that we touch a lot of people
[57:42] because of so many people are affected
[57:44] by cancer
[57:46] and we get so many reports in almost
[57:48] every week
[57:50] of pray for me i i'm suffering with
[57:52] cancer one of the pastors in europe
[57:54] actually
[57:55] his daughter they just sent word even
[57:57] today that his daughter
[57:59] has cancer and she has lung
[58:02] or actually breast cancer and
[58:05] and brother gerd actually sent me a note
[58:07] today
[58:09] to be remembering them in prayer let me
[58:11] just say this to you cancer
[58:12] has a lot of fear that goes with it and
[58:15] there's a lot of torment that goes with
[58:17] it
[58:18] but let me just say this you our god
[58:21] is bigger than every cancer in the body
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:29] so i could choose to live in a negative
[58:31] room
[58:33] are you with me i did all the things
[58:36] that i need to do
[58:37] and one of the doctors told me the other
[58:40] day said are you working on your uh what
[58:41] they call that bucket
[58:43] bucket list
[58:47] well i'm not expecting to die so
[58:50] no need me starting a bucket list
[58:52] anytime soon
[59:00] all that was free
[59:06] verse 10 but the rich and that he is
[59:10] made low because as a flower
[59:12] of the grass he shall pass away
[59:15] when i read that scripture i think about
[59:18] men that no doubt was on the scene when
[59:20] john wesley was here
[59:22] or even martin luther was here or even
[59:24] columba was here
[59:26] that were millionaires and here was
[59:29] some of these preachers that were
[59:30] absolute pulpers
[59:33] those millionaires they couldn't take it
[59:35] with them
[59:39] but those men that were paupers that
[59:41] preached the gospel
[59:43] they took it all with them
[59:47] are you with me there's your glass
[59:50] full for the sun is no sooner risen but
[59:55] with the burning heat but it withers the
[59:57] grass and the flower thereof falleth
[1:00:00] and grace of the fashion it it of it is
[1:00:03] perish so
[1:00:04] so also is the rich man faith away
[1:00:07] in his ways this is a powerful scripture
[1:00:10] hang on to it
[1:00:11] blessed is the man that endureth
[1:00:13] temptation
[1:00:15] for when he is tried he shall receive
[1:00:19] the crown
[1:00:20] of life which the lord hath promised to
[1:00:25] them
[1:00:25] that loved him so in your temptation
[1:00:29] storm god will make a way of escape for
[1:00:33] you
[1:00:33] [Applause]
[1:00:36] are you with me the pulling string on
[1:00:39] your life
[1:00:40] brother branham will remind us as
[1:00:42] ministers be
[1:00:43] careful with popularity money or women
[1:00:47] are you with me we were talking on the
[1:00:49] way down the road tonight and
[1:00:51] and uh just talking about temptations
[1:00:53] and and i said well one of my greatest
[1:00:55] temptations is sugar
[1:00:58] not women but sugar
[1:01:07] a dozen of this krispy kreme donuts has
[1:01:09] been on my
[1:01:13] my shelf today and that thing has been
[1:01:16] like a
[1:01:17] devil calling me all day
[1:01:22] i have overcome except for this morning
[1:01:32] how do i know what my temptation is
[1:01:34] brother ron
[1:01:35] that which pulls on you
[1:01:40] that which pulls on you and your
[1:01:42] temptation may not even be your wife's
[1:01:45] temptation
[1:01:46] may not be your neighbor's temptation or
[1:01:49] somebody else in the church but
[1:01:52] god wants first place in your
[1:01:55] life
[1:01:59] and many times those temptations will
[1:02:02] destroy your
[1:02:03] body spirit and your soul
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:08] but every man that is tempted when he is
[1:02:11] drawn away with his
[1:02:12] own lust
[1:02:18] and enticed i skipped the scripture
[1:02:21] let no man say when he is tempted i am
[1:02:24] tempted of god
[1:02:25] amen for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:02:31] neither tempteth he any man
[1:02:34] but every man is tempted when he's drawn
[1:02:36] away of his own lust
[1:02:38] and enticed let me just say young people
[1:02:42] satan will never stop pulling on you
[1:02:48] even when you're grey-headed and can't
[1:02:50] see and definitely can't hear
[1:02:52] he will not stop pulling on you
[1:02:56] whether you're strong sitting in church
[1:02:58] or in a nursing home
[1:03:00] he will be after you and because you
[1:03:04] won't bite on one bait
[1:03:05] won't mean he won't quit fishing
[1:03:10] but god will be with you in your storm
[1:03:18] then when lust is conceived it bringeth
[1:03:22] forth sin
[1:03:23] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[1:03:25] forth death
[1:03:28] do not err my beloved brethren
[1:03:31] every good gift and perfect gift is bore
[1:03:34] is from above
[1:03:35] and cometh down from the father of
[1:03:37] lights with whom
[1:03:39] is no variableness neither a shadow of
[1:03:42] turn
[1:03:43] of his own will begot he us with the
[1:03:46] word of truth
[1:03:47] that we should be a kind of
[1:03:51] first fruits of his creature wherefore
[1:03:54] my beloved brethren
[1:03:55] let every man be swift to heal
[1:03:59] this is incredible scripture tonight
[1:04:01] swift to hear
[1:04:03] slow to speak
[1:04:06] slow to wrath hallelujah probably ought
[1:04:11] to read that 14
[1:04:12] times but those that are having a
[1:04:13] problem with that tongue tonight
[1:04:15] remember this life and death comes right
[1:04:18] out of your tongue
[1:04:21] you want to create a bad atmosphere just
[1:04:24] use that tongue the wrong way
[1:04:27] brother ron i don't know what you're
[1:04:28] talking about tell your wife tomorrow
[1:04:30] morning how ugly she is you're probably
[1:04:32] going to miss
[1:04:33] service
[1:04:36] you will create an atmosphere but if you
[1:04:38] turn that to praise
[1:04:41] the older you get the more beautiful you
[1:04:44] are
[1:04:46] of all the trillions of women in the
[1:04:48] world god picked me
[1:04:49] to live with you you're the most
[1:04:51] beautiful wonderful woman in the world
[1:04:54] and i'm glad we're going to live
[1:04:55] together for eternity
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:00] it's a truth it's a true
[1:05:06] church
[1:05:10] wherefore lay apart all filthiness and
[1:05:13] superfluity
[1:05:14] and naughtiness and receive with with
[1:05:17] meekness the engrafted word which is
[1:05:19] able to save your lives
[1:05:22] but be your doers of the word and not
[1:05:24] hearers only
[1:05:26] this is powerful scripture because so
[1:05:29] many people want to be spectators even
[1:05:31] at church
[1:05:35] spectators don't they don't want to
[1:05:37] participate
[1:05:41] hallelujah it's kind of like going to a
[1:05:43] banquet
[1:05:47] i watch people i'm gonna keep my head
[1:05:49] down here for a minute
[1:05:50] i watch people
[1:05:57] and they'll go to a bank that's just
[1:05:59] extremely prepared
[1:06:02] and they walk in and maybe it's a
[1:06:04] potluck dinner and they bring a dish
[1:06:05] about this big
[1:06:06] expecting to feed 300 people
[1:06:14] when it comes time to clean up they run
[1:06:16] from a broom like they've never it
[1:06:18] looked like a witch is riding on it
[1:06:24] they feel like they're too good to be a
[1:06:25] part of all of that let me just say this
[1:06:27] to you
[1:06:28] if you're lazy
[1:06:33] i'm going to preach to you we're a
[1:06:35] working church here
[1:06:37] we're a team here
[1:06:41] we're a body of believers here
[1:06:49] well i'm going to leave that up to this
[1:06:51] one and i'm going to lay and leave it up
[1:06:52] to this
[1:06:54] why do i mention something carnal
[1:06:55] because it becomes spiritual
[1:06:58] you're not careful you're just hearing
[1:07:00] the gospel
[1:07:01] you're never praying
[1:07:06] you're never doing study on your own
[1:07:09] you're never giving an encouraging word
[1:07:11] to somebody else are you with me now
[1:07:13] as well preach to me help me preach
[1:07:16] praising in the storm
[1:07:21] it's a principle that you've got to have
[1:07:23] in your life
[1:07:24] when everything looks like it's upside
[1:07:26] down
[1:07:27] it is the time
[1:07:31] to start thinking joint
[1:07:37] i know a man that was a preacher his
[1:07:40] world flipped upside
[1:07:41] down it was torn completely apart
[1:07:46] absolutely totally apart
[1:07:51] and he thought suicide was the answer
[1:07:55] so he's just started before he killed
[1:07:58] himself he just started thanking god
[1:08:02] i know this man he just started thanking
[1:08:05] god for everything that god had done
[1:08:08] and before it was done
[1:08:11] he had a revival
[1:08:15] and that moment changed his life
[1:08:19] and he said just as i was getting ready
[1:08:21] to take my own life
[1:08:22] god gave me a brand new life
[1:08:45] for he beholdeth himself
[1:08:48] and goeth his way verse 24 and straight
[1:08:51] forth forgetteth what
[1:08:52] manner of man he was but whosoever
[1:08:55] looketh into the perfect law of liberty
[1:08:57] and continue therein
[1:09:00] he being not a forgetful hearer but a
[1:09:04] doer
[1:09:04] of the work this man shall be blessed
[1:09:09] in his deed let me just say god
[1:09:12] is a rewarder you will never do
[1:09:16] anything for god that he don't turn and
[1:09:19] bless you for
[1:09:20] it are you with me now
[1:09:25] are you with me if any man among you
[1:09:28] seem to be religious
[1:09:30] and bridleth not his tongue
[1:09:38] this was one of brother homer's favorite
[1:09:39] scriptures right here
[1:09:43] but deceiveth him his
[1:09:46] own heart
[1:09:49] this man's religion is in vain
[1:09:54] so if the holy ghost doesn't bridle your
[1:09:56] tongue
[1:09:58] you need another dose give the lord a
[1:10:02] good hand right there
[1:10:02] [Applause]
[1:10:12] the scripture says and we read this last
[1:10:14] week god is our refuge
[1:10:16] two weeks ago a very present help in
[1:10:19] trouble
[1:10:22] god don't go into a crisis meeting
[1:10:24] saying oh mercy they've run into a bunk
[1:10:27] he saw it a long time ago
[1:10:30] so he has prepared you whether you
[1:10:33] realize it or not
[1:10:35] before abraham was ever asked to go up
[1:10:37] on a mountain to take his son's life
[1:10:40] abraham had had a lot of trials before
[1:10:42] that to get him
[1:10:43] ready to believe that god that would ask
[1:10:46] him that
[1:10:47] and if he did take his life he'd raise
[1:10:49] him back up
[1:10:52] so in the midst of his storm knowing
[1:10:55] he's going up there to take the boy's
[1:10:56] life
[1:10:57] he told the boys that were with him
[1:11:00] we will be back
[1:11:06] you got to trust god brother ron i'm
[1:11:09] just going to quit because i'm having
[1:11:11] such a horrible time
[1:11:12] you've listened to the wrong voice
[1:11:17] the voice is always telling you of the
[1:11:19] devil
[1:11:20] god don't love you the people don't love
[1:11:23] you you ain't got a
[1:11:24] relationship with the lord
[1:11:28] and that is only telling you if you've
[1:11:31] reversed that
[1:11:33] he's telling you even the devil's
[1:11:35] telling you subliminally
[1:11:37] god loves you and he'll never give up on
[1:11:40] you
[1:11:42] but my job is to tell you that god don't
[1:11:44] love you
[1:11:45] he don't care about you your name never
[1:11:47] gets called up
[1:11:51] you know i could care less if my name
[1:11:53] ever got called here long as it's called
[1:11:55] there
[1:11:55] and then he says well done ron
[1:12:02] amen therefore
[1:12:06] will not we fear
[1:12:09] though the earth be removed though the
[1:12:11] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:12:13] the sea
[1:12:14] the waters thereof roar and be troubled
[1:12:17] the mountains shaken the swelling
[1:12:19] thereof

[1:12:29] of the tabernacles of the most high god

[1:16:26] psalms 23 and verse 1 very familiar to
[1:16:29] all of us
[1:16:30] the lord is my shepherd powerful
[1:16:34] words he is my shepherd and i
[1:16:37] shall not want he maketh me to lie down
[1:16:40] in green pastures and he leadeth me
[1:16:42] beside of the still waters
[1:16:44] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[1:16:46] the past of righteousness
[1:16:48] for his name's sake and yea though i
[1:16:50] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:16:52] death
[1:16:52] i will fear no evil you can walk
[1:16:56] through your storm
[1:17:03] for thou art with me
[1:17:07] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:17:13] i was standing there when my mother
[1:17:15] passed
[1:17:18] she had talked to me and andrew she was
[1:17:21] as calm as
[1:17:22] probably more common than i am right now
[1:17:25] we talked a few things how are we doing
[1:17:26] how are you doing
[1:17:28] uh we talked about how much we loved her
[1:17:32] how much we thanked her
[1:17:33] the doctor had already prepped us that
[1:17:35] she was getting ready to pass it just
[1:17:36] any minute
[1:17:37] and the doctor just asked her one more
[1:17:39] time why don't you just
[1:17:41] if just let us let us try to help you
[1:17:44] she said i'm ready to go
[1:17:46] and about that time the switch just went
[1:17:47] she went
[1:17:50] why wasn't she upset and fearful brother
[1:17:52] brown said i don't want to be a coward
[1:17:54] when it comes down to dying
[1:17:59] so many people romanticize death songs
[1:18:02] of death
[1:18:03] talk of death constantly involved death
[1:18:07] is there
[1:18:07] let me just say something about death to
[1:18:09] a christian
[1:18:11] death is your taxi cab
[1:18:16] well let me put it up into a new room
[1:18:19] it's your uber driver
[1:18:26] and you've been a christian all your
[1:18:27] life and you committed it to christ
[1:18:32] and death is on its door and it's come
[1:18:34] it couldn't come a minute earlier
[1:18:36] and it couldn't have been a minute later
[1:18:39] it's a tool in the hand of god
[1:18:41] to transport you from here to heaven
[1:18:48] paul said to be absent from this body is
[1:18:50] to be present with the lord
[1:18:55] are you with me i know we had such a
[1:18:58] fear of coving but let me just say this
[1:19:00] your sister matters
[1:19:02] transformed from this body that was
[1:19:04] couldn't hardly get herself out of a
[1:19:06] couch
[1:19:08] into a body where she's running
[1:19:11] she doesn't have a grey hair he got
[1:19:15] melvin from a from a situation in a
[1:19:17] nursing home having it set in a
[1:19:19] wheelchair
[1:19:20] or in a nursing bed to a body that was
[1:19:22] well
[1:19:23] never to be sick again it gave brother
[1:19:26] homer
[1:19:27] two legs in a second
[1:19:40] are you with me so god intercedes for us
[1:19:43] even in our time of death
[1:19:47] sometimes we look at it wrong and sure
[1:19:49] we sorrow
[1:19:50] sure we we we're we're sad to see our
[1:19:52] loved ones go home
[1:19:54] sure we grieve but it should be a time
[1:19:57] of rejoicing
[1:19:58] in the storm
[1:20:01] no more pain no more agony no more irs
[1:20:05] no more presidential elections
[1:20:09] that's enough to praise god about
[1:20:16] raphael
[1:20:19] we're getting in we'll get won't be long
[1:20:21] we'll be into october
[1:20:23] and we've just elected a president
[1:20:24] they'll start running in october for the
[1:20:26] next term
[1:20:33] well i better get off of that
[1:20:39] luke chapter 11 verse 9
[1:20:43] and i say unto you ask
[1:20:53] and it shall be given you
[1:20:57] now this is in your red letter edition
[1:21:00] bible
[1:21:01] so that means that this is jesus
[1:21:06] i say unto you ask
[1:21:10] amen you heard me a few weeks ago talk
[1:21:13] about if you don't pray
[1:21:17] you have to ask ask specifically
[1:21:26] tomorrow morning i'm going to share with
[1:21:28] you i'm going to bring a deer to church
[1:21:32] i'm actually going to bring a deer to
[1:21:33] church tomorrow morning hallelujah
[1:21:36] because when i preached identified for
[1:21:38] rapture
[1:21:40] let me remember that sermon it's okay
[1:21:43] it's okay i'm looking down
[1:21:46] after i walked into the back 12 years
[1:21:49] since i'd killed a trophy buck
[1:21:51] these guys are sitting back there and i
[1:21:54] just felt inspiration i said tomorrow
[1:21:57] i'm going to kill a buck this wide and i
[1:22:00] was sitting down and i said tomorrow i'm
[1:22:01] going to kill a buck this wide
[1:22:03] and he's going to stand about that tall
[1:22:08] 4 30 brother andrew texted me said have
[1:22:11] you seen anything i said not a thing i
[1:22:13] hadn't seen anything all day
[1:22:15] in two minutes the buck that i asked for
[1:22:21] i had saw him flip over like that right
[1:22:23] there
[1:22:24] and i said well i just got him they
[1:22:26] couldn't believe it because they didn't
[1:22:27] hear the shot
[1:22:33] in hindsight i should ask for this
[1:22:39] are you with me but i want to show it to
[1:22:43] you
[1:22:45] because it's just as big a miracle
[1:22:50] as that little boy getting ready to walk
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:23:02] now the scripture said ask and it shall
[1:23:04] be given you
[1:23:06] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:23:09] shall be open unto you
[1:23:10] for everyone that asketh receiveth and
[1:23:13] he that seeketh findeth
[1:23:15] and to him that knocketh it shall be
[1:23:17] opened
[1:23:19] are you with me now remember who you are
[1:23:22] how powerful you are
[1:23:23] you're more powerful than an archangel
[1:23:25] that's in heaven
[1:23:27] jesus said this i am the true vine and
[1:23:30] my father is the husbandman
[1:23:33] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:23:34] fruity taketh away in every branch
[1:23:37] that beareth fruit he purchased it that
[1:23:39] it might bring forth more fruit
[1:23:42] now you're clean through the word which
[1:23:43] i've spoken unto you
[1:23:45] abide in me
[1:23:48] and i knew
[1:23:55] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[1:23:57] itself except it abideth in the vine
[1:24:00] no more can ye except you abide in me
[1:24:03] i am the vine and ye are the branches
[1:24:07] and he that abideth in me and i and you
[1:24:09] the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:24:11] for without me i love this without me
[1:24:15] you can do nothing
[1:24:17] jesus reminded us over and over again in
[1:24:20] his humanity i can do nothing except my
[1:24:24] father shows me first
[1:24:29] if you abide not in me he that is cast
[1:24:31] forth as a branch and
[1:24:32] is withered and men gather them and cast
[1:24:35] them into the fire and they are burned
[1:24:36] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:24:39] you shall ask what you
[1:24:40] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:24:42] you
[1:24:44] one of brother branham's uh mentors
[1:24:48] that was just before brother branham
[1:24:51] f uh not f f bossworth but smith
[1:24:53] wigglesworth
[1:24:55] he would go into a hospital and tell
[1:24:57] them you quote the scripture
[1:25:00] until you believe it if you abide in me
[1:25:04] and my words abide in you
[1:25:08] ask what you will and it shall be done
[1:25:10] unto you and he would tell them when
[1:25:12] that becomes a reality to you
[1:25:14] you get up and put your clothes on
[1:25:18] and go home

[1:26:14] i said sure he he said he sure would and
[1:26:17] so they went over and they told him
[1:26:19] they said this is a man of god and he's
[1:26:22] going to pray for you
[1:26:23] and you're going to get well
[1:26:28] notice they're positive speaking they've
[1:26:30] never heard brother homer preach a
[1:26:32] sermon
[1:26:34] but they saw a life manifested
[1:26:41] many times people that work with you get
[1:26:44] healed because of your prayer
[1:26:47] they ask you to pray because they see
[1:26:49] your life
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:51] [Applause]
[1:26:55] brother homer went back two weeks later
[1:26:58] and he
[1:26:59] he said did the man die he said no said
[1:27:02] said after you left said he got well god
[1:27:05] walked got up changed his clothes and
[1:27:06] they took him home
[1:27:10] amen
[1:27:14] hallelujah oh don't you love the lord
[1:27:19] don't you just love the lord now watch
[1:27:22] this just a moment he says
[1:27:24] many people come to the altar to be
[1:27:26] prayed for and they have an intellectual
[1:27:28] faith
[1:27:31] they believe in their heart
[1:27:36] their mind they believe it because
[1:27:38] they've heard it
[1:27:40] they believe it because they know it's
[1:27:42] the best policy
[1:27:44] but that's not what god looks at he
[1:27:47] don't look at your intellectual faith
[1:27:49] he looks on your heart where there's an
[1:27:51] inside and sitting and he said
[1:27:53] when it comes from your heart all things
[1:27:56] are possible
[1:28:00] when you confess your confession meets
[1:28:04] up with your life
[1:28:05] your life speaks as loud as your
[1:28:08] confession does
[1:28:10] and when your confession says one thing
[1:28:12] in your life says another.
[1:28:18] there's something wrong somewhere that's
[1:28:21] because you've got an intellectual faith
[1:28:23] and not a faith in your heart
[1:28:25] and that and that shows that outside the
[1:28:28] knowledge of god but
[1:28:29] inside there's a demon of doubting
[1:28:37] powerful powerful
[1:28:40] brother branham said give me a preacher
[1:28:43] give me a christian give me a housewife
[1:28:48] that's a christian give me a farmer
[1:28:53] a factory worker that'll put god first
[1:28:55] in everything
[1:28:57] and i'll show you a man that'll be
[1:28:59] successful in spite of
[1:29:01] all the devil can put on him amen
[1:29:06] he seeks god first
[1:29:11] what did god tell me before the trial
[1:29:14] ever started
[1:29:15] if you trust me i'll use you like never
[1:29:22] before
[1:29:24] are you with me
[1:29:28] that's the way it is with every
[1:29:30] born-again christian
[1:29:32] when he really gets into god and he
[1:29:33] watches his life and god's word and
[1:29:35] realizes it's lined up in every bit of
[1:29:37] it
[1:29:39] he's got long-suffering gentleness and
[1:29:41] quietness and maintenance and power and
[1:29:43] faith
[1:29:43] love joy and peace he ain't tossed about
[1:29:48] like a troubled sea he ain't worried
[1:29:51] about every little thing
[1:29:52] he ain't jumping here like the bottle
[1:29:54] stopper on a windy ocean
[1:29:56] he's set he's pure
[1:30:00] your home should not be a storm
[1:30:06] can i preach to you your home needs to
[1:30:10] be the most
[1:30:11] peaceful place on earth
[1:30:14] it needs to be a sanctuary where god is
[1:30:17] welcome
[1:30:18] every minute of the day
[1:30:24] brother on but we just floss and fight
[1:30:25] all the time get right with god
[1:30:30] get right with god but it's my wife you
[1:30:32] chose her it's my husband you chose him
[1:30:38] it ain't the preacher's fault but you
[1:30:40] need to get right with god i got a
[1:30:48] letter this week about
[1:30:49] how much drama was in this person's life
[1:30:52] i responded
[1:30:54] we are a church of no drama
[1:31:01] i've been at places that has a
[1:31:05] a box in the back that says any
[1:31:08] complaint put it here
[1:31:12] we got the same kind of facility
[1:31:16] it's a can that stands about this tall
[1:31:19] and it's got a for a general it's got a
[1:31:21] white trash can liner
[1:31:23] in it and you feel welcome to put your
[1:31:26] complaint there anytime
[1:31:30] [Applause]
[1:31:37] i don't have drama in business i don't
[1:31:39] have drama in my home
[1:31:41] and i'm going to be a pastor that has no
[1:31:43] drama
[1:31:45] as a matter of fact my doctors told me
[1:31:46] the rest of my life i'm going to have no
[1:31:48] drama
[1:31:49] no drama make sure your family no drama
[1:31:53] well i've been having that policy all my
[1:31:55] life
[1:31:56] i don't like drunk
[1:32:00] well brother on i just have to fuss i
[1:32:02] just have to get it off my chest go
[1:32:04] out to a fence post and just stand there
[1:32:07] and tell that fence post
[1:32:09] just tell it off
[1:32:14] just telling everything that's on your
[1:32:16] mind
[1:32:17] when you're done repent
[1:32:20] because you're going to need it be
[1:32:23] thankful that that
[1:32:25] fence post won't argue back with you
[1:32:29] hey that was for somebody i'm preaching
[1:32:32] on a storm so evidently i found one
[1:32:44] now jesus christ came from heaven to
[1:32:46] glory
[1:32:48] down here to build a church and the
[1:32:51] material that he's putting in it
[1:32:54] is time-tested material
[1:32:58] you might come to an altar and make a
[1:33:00] confession but
[1:33:02] when you find blowholes and everything
[1:33:05] else
[1:33:06] in there where the world's blown maggots
[1:33:08] in you
[1:33:09] and so forth you cannot stand
[1:33:17] he just pitches you from one side god
[1:33:20] wants a time-tested church
[1:33:24] not a christian today and a backslider
[1:33:26] tomorrow
[1:33:32] and it's in and out and up and down
[1:33:36] he can't place you nowhere
[1:33:42] but he's got a church that's tested
[1:33:47] went through the trouts through losses
[1:33:52] through sickness through sorrow
[1:33:55] through death and still standing with
[1:33:59] the testimony
[1:34:00] glory to god we've got a bunch of that
[1:34:02] in this building
[1:34:05] you've been through some monster storms
[1:34:07] and you're
[1:34:08] still standing
[1:34:18] [Applause]
[1:34:26] god doesn't have to give you a pacifier
[1:34:27] every time
[1:34:30] as i said a couple weeks ago we don't
[1:34:33] have adult diapers here
[1:34:46] i said this to you the other day and i
[1:34:48] want to say it again to bill for
[1:34:49] tomorrow
[1:34:52] what man calls great god calls foolish
[1:34:57] and what a man calls foolish god calls
[1:35:00] great
[1:35:03] so what we've got to do is get back into
[1:35:05] the program of god and find out after
[1:35:08] all
[1:35:08] what god wants us to do
[1:35:12] and the only way that i know to do that
[1:35:14] is prayer
[1:35:16] prayer is the key
[1:35:21] that's the answer prayer changes things
[1:35:26] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:35:29] was ever put
[1:35:30] in the control of human beings there's
[1:35:32] no atomic bomb
[1:35:34] or a hydrogen bomb as powerful as
[1:35:37] prayer
[1:35:41] prayer will try to change the mind of
[1:35:43] god
[1:35:48] in spiritual scriptural signs of the
[1:35:51] times he said
[1:35:52] today what they have the nerve to say
[1:35:55] wonder why
[1:35:56] what happened to the god of the bible
[1:35:58] where is that at
[1:36:01] why you choked him out by your creeds
[1:36:05] you choked him out by your traditions
[1:36:09] you tried to place him back in history
[1:36:12] he is a god of history and what he's
[1:36:16] waiting on today there's the same god of
[1:36:18] history
[1:36:20] that when moses called on him at the red
[1:36:22] sea the god of history rose up and made
[1:36:24] a way
[1:36:26] and when joshua called on the god of
[1:36:28] history at jordan
[1:36:29] he rose up and made a way and daniel
[1:36:32] called on him in a fiery furnace
[1:36:34] and he made a way
[1:36:40] are you with me yes whether your name's
[1:36:43] karen pruitt or elena butts or
[1:36:45] doug hill
[1:36:49] god sees a storm at your end he knows
[1:36:51] what you're going through
[1:36:53] and he's made a way for you
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:37:01] hallelujah
[1:37:04] satan may pin you in a corner
[1:37:09] he may pin you in a corner with cancer
[1:37:12] god will make a way of escape
[1:37:15] he may pin you under a car god will make
[1:37:18] a way of escape satan may take your
[1:37:21] family away from you
[1:37:22] god will make a way of escape god has
[1:37:25] always made a way i'd like to remind you
[1:37:29] god's never failed
[1:37:33] can i give you just a few more quotes
[1:37:36] you have been given checkbook authority
[1:37:39] you have not because you asked not
[1:37:41] sometimes you just got to write the
[1:37:43] check
[1:37:44] my mother was famous for taking checks
[1:37:47] and she'd place him in her bible
[1:37:49] and when we got her bible there was
[1:37:51] checks all through her bible
[1:37:53] and a lot of miracles happened
[1:37:56] [Music]
[1:37:59] sometimes you got to just do what it
[1:38:01] says
[1:38:04] write the check sign it
[1:38:07] mrs jesus christ send it through the
[1:38:09] bank of heaven
[1:38:11] it may take 25 years like it did abraham
[1:38:14] to have a son
[1:38:15] but let me just say when god makes a
[1:38:17] promise he will make a way
[1:38:20] [Applause]
[1:38:25] brother ron but i'm trying my best let
[1:38:27] me just say this you
[1:38:29] it's when you give up and say god it's
[1:38:31] all yours
[1:38:33] i've made a mess out of my life i've had
[1:38:35] a lot of trouble
[1:38:36] god i give you the steering wheel i want
[1:38:39] you to drive a little bit
[1:38:41] it's stronger than a country song
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:48] amen hallelujah
[1:38:51] hallelujah brother andrew glover
[1:38:55] spoke these words last week you've heard
[1:38:57] them almost every weekend since you've
[1:38:59] been in church
[1:39:00] he knows that if the people get at the
[1:39:02] true revelation of the true church
[1:39:04] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:39:07] that she can do the greater works
[1:39:10] she will be an invincible army you are
[1:39:13] god's queen
[1:39:14] living in mortal flesh on the earth but
[1:39:17] the season of immortality is upon us
[1:39:20] we're getting ready to be changed
[1:39:26] are you with me now he made a way he
[1:39:28] conquered sickness
[1:39:31] so every sickness that comes across the
[1:39:33] doctor's lips
[1:39:34] jesus has already conquered it
[1:39:38] do you believe that do you believe that
[1:39:42] he's already conquered it
[1:39:47] he conquered temptation
[1:39:53] but brother ron jesus didn't have a
[1:39:56] computer he didn't have an iphone
[1:39:58] to have to deal with he conquered the
[1:40:01] devils
[1:40:02] that invented the machine
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:10] and if you'll spend your time more in
[1:40:12] prayer and reading your bible
[1:40:14] and listen to some good hospital
[1:40:16] wholesome gospel music
[1:40:19] and the prophet of god and get your mind
[1:40:22] off of what's seeing the internet
[1:40:25] [Applause]
[1:40:27] and fox is trying to tell you hey listen
[1:40:29] they've all got their own parallels
[1:40:31] there is a king that's coming
[1:40:35] and i'm in his kingdom and it will be
[1:40:38] peace
[1:40:39] for eternity
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:47] have faith in god
[1:40:51] i love this quote it's a pet quote of
[1:40:55] mine
[1:40:57] oh my how the devil has to recognize the
[1:41:01] supreme authority of jesus christ
[1:41:05] not me he hates me
[1:41:09] he don't have to mind me but he has to
[1:41:12] mind who i represent
[1:41:18] he has to mind who sent me here
[1:41:21] i love that
[1:41:24] he don't have to fear me
[1:41:29] he don't fear me but he has to fear who
[1:41:31] i represent
[1:41:34] this fellow here drove up today
[1:41:38] any state trooper car backed it in i was
[1:41:40] sitting on the porch
[1:41:43] it's been a day in my life a state
[1:41:45] trooper showing up at my house
[1:41:47] before i was married
[1:41:50] would have sent chills through me
[1:41:53] but you see i know who he represents
[1:41:59] i don't know about you but when you're
[1:42:00] on the interstate and all of a sudden
[1:42:02] a fellow like this rolls in behind you
[1:42:05] it sends
[1:42:06] chills you hit your brakes
[1:42:10] and you're doing five miles under the
[1:42:12] speed limit
[1:42:17] amen because you fear who he represents
[1:42:26] i'm using that for an example
[1:42:29] now i don't know what kind of storm that

[1:43:59] to represent him
[1:44:08] can i just drop this free to you your
[1:44:11] prayers
[1:44:12] are like salt as a preservative
[1:44:16] to the vegetables in your garden
[1:44:21] the salt preserves that fruit
[1:44:25] or those vegetables to keep them from
[1:44:27] rottening
[1:44:28] and whether you realize it or not your
[1:44:30] community would be
[1:44:32] much worse without your prayers

[1:44:44] your prayers maybe are keeping your
[1:44:47] company going

[1:45:02] because of the angels of god that are
[1:45:05] compassed about you
[1:45:08] [Applause]
[1:45:11] well brother ron but i'm in a storm of
[1:45:13] my life let me finish with this
[1:45:16] moses mother joseph
[1:45:20] was asked to put a baby
[1:45:23] into a crocodile infested water
[1:45:30] she was told by with her husband was
[1:45:33] told by an angel of the lord
[1:45:35] that he was the deliverer
[1:45:39] are you with me there's sometimes you
[1:45:42] can't see it
[1:45:44] you can't vindicate it but you believe
[1:45:46] it
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:50] and god asked them to preserve him
[1:45:53] put him in the basket and let him go
[1:45:56] down the crocodile
[1:45:58] infested water they couldn't hear it but
[1:46:01] a prophet of god told us what happened
[1:46:03] william branham told us
[1:46:04] said that god lined up gabriel to stand
[1:46:08] on the bush on that on that on that
[1:46:11] that that bushel stand on the end of it
[1:46:16] and when the crocodiles came up simply
[1:46:18] kick them back down in the water
[1:46:21] and to line ten thousand angels up and
[1:46:24] down the river
[1:46:26] and when he got into the whirlpools and
[1:46:29] storms of
[1:46:30] life see that he gets out
[1:46:33] [Applause]
[1:46:37] if god can take care of a baby
[1:46:42] in a crocodile infested water
[1:46:46] in a basket that had car all over it
[1:46:49] and put angels all around it he can take
[1:46:52] care of you

[1:48:25] while her stomach and her heart
[1:48:29] were falling apart

[1:48:42] powerful angels in heaven amen

[1:49:15] whatever you need in life he's the
[1:49:17] waymaker
