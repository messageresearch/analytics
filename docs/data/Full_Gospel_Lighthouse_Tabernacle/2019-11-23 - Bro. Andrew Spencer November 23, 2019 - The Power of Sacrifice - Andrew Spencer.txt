Gladstone and said mr. Gladstone I would appreciate your giving me a few minutes in which I might lay before you my plans for the future he says I would like to study law yes said the great statesman and what then he said then sir I would like to gain entrance to the bar of England yes young man and and what then he said then sir I hope to have a place in Parliament in the House of Lords and he said yes young man what then pressed Gladstone he said then I hope to do great things for Britain he said yes young man and what then then sir I hope to retire and take life easy yes young man and and what then he tenaciously asked well then mr. Gladstone I suppose I will die yes young man and what then the young man hesitated and then said I never thought any further than that sir looking at the young man sternly and steadily Gladstone said young man you are a fool go home and think life through here is is depicted a young man that came to a great statesman that had prepped in his life and in his thinking how that everything was going to take place and transpire in his future and no doubt in his mind he had set apart different energies and sacrifices that he would make for worldly gain but he had never went so far as to the think of the sacrifices that he would make towards the prince of life he never gave thought he gave thought to all the worldly things and he gave thought to all the things that would would help him gain entrance into a greater stature of a human being in the natural realm but he had not gained gave any interest and he not gave any thought to the afterlife and if you have not gave any thought to your afterlife and where you're going to spend eternity I trust you make those thoughts this evening where where you will decide and and you know as we think on this thought on the power of sacrifice that that you find today that sacrifice is so little talked about anymore and and really sacrifice is hardly seen anymore amongst people because what sacrifice is the sacrifice is serving is serving others and and being a Christian is to is spend in a life of service that's what in life of a Christian is and and and you know I found in life that a lot of people want to be served but they don't want to serve others they want to spend their time sit back and lay back in a lazy boy and let somebody make them happy in life but they don't want to they don't want to get up and do anything they want their children to get up and and pay the bills for more or maybe maybe they maybe it's a child another stance and maybe they get a getting a little bit of a I hit about them and think well my parents should provide for everything for me they're not there to serve anymore but I remember times I remember times that that you know everybody everybody now wants everything just right in the minute or right in the moment but you know one time there was somebody in our family I talked Grandaddy and said hey you know something said you you and all of your business dealings and things you should have created a a a green bean picker and a green bean breaker he said I did he said I birthed all of this line of children right here in grandchildren he said he said that's what you are but I you know there's a lot of people that just want to put the dishes in the dishwasher and they don't want to have to sacrifice their time of just sitting down but I remember times as was young people that that we would sit down and we would sacrifice and we were the dishwasher back then but a lot of people don't understand sacrifice the way that that they things were back when and that's not been too long ago but I find sometimes that there's young people amongst us that don't understand how our life truly was or how how lie how great we have it in this life and you know there's very little bit of Tom say that is spent in sacrifice or spent serving God or they they people you find it today that people want an experience right now but yet they don't were to sacrifice the time I'm truly having a born-again baptism of the Holy Ghost but if you search out your life and look at everything that you do you will find that everything that you do is involved in a sacrifice and you may not make it to make it be that way but you know that you sacrifice time for your family instead of coming to the house of God sometimes or your sacrifice doing this or enjoyments and times and instead of to having time spent with God and there there's no power in a sacrifice of spending time on in in enchantments and witchdoctors and things like that but there is power in the sacrifice of the Lamb of God but everything that we do is spend in sacrifice we sacrifice time for our family and I believe that we should have time for our family but I believe that God deserves first place I believe that letter that there's people that spend time for their work but they don't spend time in the Bible you see you a sacrifice sacrifice it is the act of slaughtering an animal for an offering to God or it means to give up something valued for the sake of something else more important maybe I'll put it in terminology where some of the young people get it or some of the young boys that play baseball get it but there is such thing as a sacrifice bunt and what they're doing there as they're trying to advance a runner to the next position and though they may not get on base they'll maybe get out but yet they are pushing they are advancing the runner forward and you know I've found sometimes that young people or even sometimes so-called Christians of today they don't want to sacrifice their own time just just to move somebody else forward what is life's worth then if we're not here to help others if we're only here for ourselves then we are becoming a Laodicea church member but the whole purpose in life is to see somebody else but I mean my candle got lit but I want to see somebody else have the same lighting of the candle in their life you see sacrifice is something that you're willing to give up for something that you have deemed more valuable and if you deem the the life that you spend out in the world or you spend your energies out in the world and I want to say this to you that if it costs you your soul it's too expensive you may buy a lot of things in life and you may purchase a lot of things and sacrifice monies to buy different things but if it costs you your soul it's way too expensive if it costs you your peace of mind it's way too expensive and because your faith if it cost you if it cost your long suffering I want you to know it's way too expensive and I pray that you bear with me just for a moment here but the now sacrifice it's the offering of sacrifices the offering of a sacrifice as it is to be regarded as a divine institution it did not originate with man but God himself appointed appointed sacrifice as the mode in which this which was acceptable was to be offered to him by the guilty man then language and the idea of sacrifice is throughout the whole entire Bible it pervades the whole Bible of offering and sacrifices we see that throughout the Bible that there were sacrifices made and if you look back at the very beginning of the book you will see the fall of humanity and after the sinning there stood there stood Adam and Eve in the presence of God and God said depart out of my presence and he said I can see the brother's head I can see them going he said I can see evils to see see her later little head over on Adams shoulder and saying Adam it's my fault I was the one who did it but Adams so loved his wife that he wasn't deceived but he loved her so well that he walked out with her which was a perfect type of Jesus Christ Oh hallelujah who knows no sin but came to the world and taken the sin of his wife the church and walked to death with her hallelujah there they go there there there's all the great Jehovah looking at them there goes his son there goes his daughter I hear something going like this what is it it's the clapping a slapping sound it's the bloody sheepskin beating against Adams legs and he said wait a minute I will put enmity between the woman's seed and the serpent seed what was he promising he was promising a promised redeemer that would come and take away the sin of the world he was speaking of a sacrifice that was to come you go back to the very beginning and you'll find that God laid down the program right in the Garden of Eden that there was to be a sacrifice you see but man tried to make his own religion he made himself a fig leaf and he tried to cover himself but you know there was no power in those fig leaves because God seen right through those fig leaves and you can try to cover up your seeing it you can try to cover up your mistakes but God is looking right through that covering you see there's only one thing that will cover you from your sin and I'm not just talking about a covering I'm talking about a remitting of sins but the Bible said that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins but where there is the shedding of blood there is remission of sins it was the blood that brought them back into fellowship that was power in the sacrifice that allowed God to commune with his children again whoo hallelujah there was no power in the fig leaves there's no power in denominational ideas or creeds and dogmas that won't cover you but there's only one thing that will cover you from your sin that'll totally annihilate your sin and that's this blood and I want to say to you that there's power in this blood there's wonder-working power in the blood of Jesus Christ God hates a powerless religion what Adam had was a powerless religion he couldn't do anything for him he couldn't bring him back into communion but you know where the blood is there is power at you see according to God's command as we look at the animal sacrifice the animal that sacrifice had to be physically perfect in age and condition there could be no blemish on this animal hallelujah the perfection of this animal perfection was then presented to God you see this was symbolic for the people and to present themselves perfect before God by presenting the perfect one in their place you know Jesus told us to be the e therefore perfect as her father in heaven is perfect but you know there's nothing in your own works that can make you perfect there's nothing that you can do to make yourself more there's nothing that would make you be a full owner in your own righteousness their filthy arrives but I want you to know in turn the blood of Jesus Christ takes her sin and makes it righteous he makes you holy he makes you pour pure and makes you just and after the animal is selected and presented at the altar the first act was laying on hands by the person that was presenting the offer here he was he would take the lamb or he would take the animal and he would bring him up to the high priest or however the order was how he would bring him up and he would present him there because there was an innocent lamb that was going to give his life for the guilty party here the worshipper comes up and he brings he brings up the sacrifice and this sacrifice would allow him to commune with God and when the guilty person would bring up that animal he would come and ask the priest would yes he would cut the the the the animal's throat when he would slit his throat he would lay his hand upon that animal and as the innocent animals life was going out this was symbolic of that in what we do now we lay our hands upon the sacrifice and it makes us pure it makes us identified with our sacrifice are you with me tonight this was symbolically pointing to the Savior who would do this for the believers in which they could not do for themselves he would take upon himself the sin and guilt and blame and shame and all of the pain and accomplish redemption for his people hallelujah hallelujah I know there's a lot of people that like to claim the blood of Jesus Christ they like to claim that their Christian but Christ came to save his people come on somebody the blood was shed but it is for those who'd swear God's people there is so much power that it can cleanse a universe well you look over in the festival of the Day of Atonement there was two goats that depicted this redemptive act and one goat there was two goats that depicted it but one goal he dieded Steff symbolizing how the ultimate sacrifice in the future would pay the penalty for the believer sins its blood was applied to the mercy seat in the Holies of Holies when the high priests would walk in there and sprinkle the blood upon the mercy seat Oh hallelujah symbolizing hell the great sacrifice would cover the people's sins bringing them into God's presence and make full restoration to God hallelujah and then to the head of the second goat the priest symbolically transferred the sin of God's people upon the second goat hallelujah then this goat was known as the scapegoat was sent into the wilderness to symbolize the removal but the people sin if you go over in the Book of Leviticus 16 you'll see all of these things how that they transpire and how that a strong man would take that scapegoat a man that was fit to do the job would walk him out into the wilderness just like Jesus Christ walked your sin all the way out into the wilderness it had to be a fit man for the job it had to be a strong man for the job Oh hallelujah that was not two goats but Christ represented both goats he is both your death and he is your resurrection I am identified when he died with him and I am identified and I rose with him hallelujah hallelujah to know him you don't have to know a whole lot you only have to know one person and that's the Lord Jesus Christ tonight it's not about you falling in love with me but falling in love with the music but falling in love with our excitement I know what you've fallen in love with me or my preaching for I will tell you but if you fall in love with Jesus too many people got themself a personality that they want to follow one of these days this whole flesh may die and right but where will you be if I die if the pastor dies you are the soul of God no matter what he takes away from you that you'll still sacrifice the God oh I wish somebody helped me preach tonight to know him his life to know him his life to know him as your personal Savior to know him as the one who has filled you with goodness and mercy let's send the world away from you discharged it and send it away like the scapegoat in the Old Testament to go into the wilderness to be killed no more and the very thing that made you sin and do things that you used to do has been driven away from you oh what a savior we have tonight oh what a savior we have isn't this Lord Jesus lovely that the things that you want spell/trap to when the devil knew your weaknesses throughout your lineage that you felt rap to this same Lord Jesus Christ drove these things away from you whoo Oh hallelu hallelujah somebody says Bend roll from me I believe that this lamb this lamb is perfect I believe that there is so much power in this sacrifice that there is healing in the sacrifice and I don't believe that God can just keep you or I don't believe that God can just heal you wants but I believe that you can stay healed I don't believe you have to keep dealing with it or here well I'm healed now and in two more weeks huh I'm gonna go battle the same thing let the healing vultures of Christ that float down from Calvary flow over your vessel and stay healed it's God's will that you stay healed I believe there's so much power in this sacrifice that one of these morning's it's going to raise you up between 6 and 9 there's so much power in this sacrifice that the devil don't know what to do with you there's so much power in this sacrifice that it will set your soda fly there's so much power in this sacrifice that the demons of hail can surround you because there's angels there to guard you there's so much power in the sacrifice [Applause] [Applause] power [Applause] he thought you were of great value so he gave up himself who could imagine how that Adam and Eve after walking out of the guard and there stood the surface with the flaming swords guarding to the Tree of Life how that they would walk out and no doubt they would have conversations with the boys and they would sit down and they begin to tell Cain and Abel what it was like in the garden Oh in the garden it was perfection in the guard and it was sublime there's not enough words in the vocabulary to tell you how perfect it was boys but these briars that you're dealing with now they were not there in the garden that rheumatism medicine that I have to take now I didn't have to take it in the garden those wrinkles you see over my brow they weren't there in the garden Missy in the garden that was perfection in the garden I could just speak to the mountain and the mountain will move in the garden I could speak to the breeze and the breeze would stop Oh hallelujah and in the garden in the garden there was no violence there there was no trials there there was no temptation there in the garden and these boys heard this and these boys the Prophet said that the boys wanted to get back to that garden all of humanity as a Christian has humanity throughout the years has spent their life getting back to that garden but I want to tell you we're going to a place of perfection that there is no more sickness there is no more rheumatism mess there is no more aging there is no or back pain but that's not just for their I believe you can live in perfect peace right now I believe there's so much power in the sacrifice that you can be healed right now you're a son and daughter of God speak to that mountain and watch it be moved everything may be violence around you but you can be surrounded by perfect blood the Prophet said that your name is indelibly roped Alleluia by the blood of the Lamb that means that your name cannot be erased from it Satanist rod has done that he has done his very worst to try to mark out your name Oh hallelujah but I want you to know how much Satan is against me it may be stacked up way this high it don't matter if it's time as high as the highest towers in New York City he tries very best to knock me off the book but my name is indelibly wrote there I hope you don't mind me because I'm going to be there I want you to know I sure don't mind spending time with you and worship because I believe it won't be there [Applause] wonderful wonderful things of God these boys were both religious I look over and I scripture reading these boys from both religious these boys both came to worship they both built in altars they had himself a church they both offered sacrifice they both were sincere but if that's all that is required if it's all as far as you have gone in your experience is that you have offered a point what a little bit that you know you have not went far enough come on somebody if how you think it is is just coming to the house of God and that's good enough when I'd never mind I'll just stay home and I'll string you've not gone far enough yet Cain was a worshipper Cain confessed he wasn't a hypocrite he believed God he wants of God he'd knelt down and prayed the Prophet said he was a good church member oh ma look and he watched Cain as he's bringing in the sacrifice here he is offering up this sacrifice bringing in of the fruits of the land but life doesn't lay in plant life only lays in the blood here a Cain was showing where he was from and Abel he takes the grape vine and he begins to wrap it around that lambs neck and he starts leading it up the hill and he starts bringing it up to the altar that he's built and then it takes that innocent lamb and lays it upon the altar he caught the revelation of worship but why did God receive Abel and condemned Cain because that Abel had recompense under the reward because Abel had a spiritual revelation and spiritual revelation of the will of God he caught the revelation that it was blood he understood that it was not apples or pomegranates whatever they choose to say today that kicked him out of Eden I was on a wagon one time in an apple orchard and I was riding down through air and there's a bunch of people on there and I was on the back of the wagon and there was somebody up the front of the wagon and they was telling that they had just found out that it was no longer apples or pomegranates it was a bright red fruit I thought oh if you just give me a chance I could tell you what fruit it was he was the payer on the ground he was not the Apple in the tree but I think they would have kicked me off the wagon after I went ahead and told him everything that there was true science has spent all of its energy trying to find the missing link but I should tell you and I can point you to a Kentucky hillbilly prophet that could so mind boggle the scientists of today I can't find it but yet a prophet looked all the way back and seen what it was whoo let me move on he understood that it wasn't fruit that caused the fall but it was the blood that brought them back into communion notice what brother Branham says and he recognized in an afternoon Lord he said Ben look the church carnal it's just the church carnal they never able to get above the little thing of I joined church if I go to church I have out there if I do the best I can that's all God requires now that's the same thing Cain done he went and made an altar he made a sacrifice and brought the fruits of the land and he said here it is God that's the best I got take it or leave it that's the way the carnal believer does today Lord I'll go to church I'll join the best group that I can find I'm paying my dues to the church I'll do what's right here's the best I can do I'll help buy some coal for the widow or I'll I'll give the children some clothing limbs alright nothing to say against it but that's it that's all if you want it if you want it take it if you don't you don't have to take it in now that's the attitude of the church call of the day take it or leave it God Here I am you can listen to doors and doors he don't want just the door to your bedroom and he don't want just the door to your living room he wants the door to your closing he wants the door to your upper room he wants the door to your heart but God I'll let you come in this far but don't you go to Medlin and the rest of my business you've not gone far enough yet Church carnal wants to go who oh well that's all I got take it or leave it but the church spiritual able by revelation by grace he's seen beyond that and my faith he offer to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain and it testified of his righteousness notice Cain's attitude the Prophet said if if Cain would have done like his brother Abel God would have accepted it I know I just choked some of you but how to go ahead and swallow everything but if Cain would have done like Abel God would have accepted him but Cain showed where he was from when he hated his brother he shown who his daddy was hello and Abel shown who his daddy was he knew that there was power in his sacrifice he knew that this would bring communion to him and God now to sacrifice it's going to cost you something and what you're willing to sacrifice shows how much you want something you watch people spend four and five dollars for a box of cigarettes you see the sacrifice that they've got they'll sacrifice their children's money just to buy a pack of cigarettes or 6-pack of beer that won't last them through the night ain't no happiness and act but yet they'll sacrifice their hard-earned money or maybe they're bummed earn money just for a pack of cigarettes let's a knows going to put cancer in their lungs but in every sacrifice there is a cost to it you can look all throughout the Bible the burnt offering in the drink offering a fellowship offering and guilt offering the heave offering the middle offering the meat off for Anna peace offering the said offer in the thanks offering a trespass offering a wave offered and every one of those sacrifices and offerings there was a cost to it he becomes the worshipper something may be a lamb or turtle Dolph may be the meal of the land he would cost them something to bring them back into fellowship he saw it cause he saw something one Talent because his birthright to sell out for a mess of pottage Oh hallelujah but it only costs Jacob a mess of pottage for the birthright this he Esau's attitude towards it showed where he was from but Jacobs attitude towards the birthright showed that he was elected it's going to cost you something Samson knew that it was going to cost him something Samson you see God he gave God his strength but he gave Delilah his heart Samson gave out the secret of his strength and the Philistines came and overtook him and bound him plucked out his eyes next place you find Samson is down in the prison house ground ground and meal but Samson come to the final moments of his life and he was willing to sacrifice he said the trouble of it is today the church is not like Samson they're not willing to pay the price Samson prayed right when he prayed Lord let me die with the enemy he knowed it was going to cost him something he knowed it was going to cost him something it's going to cost you something he's going to cost me something your social prestige your place and position in the denomination Lord let me die he knowed it was going to cost him something and you must be ready to die out to your enemy to get in the blessings of God Samson was willing to pay the price to get the power of God again upon him he was willing to pay the price he was willing to sacrifice his life to get the power back one more time and the Prophet said are you will I wonder if you're willing to sacrifice your energies sacrifice your time on the internet or sacrifice your time on Facebook just to spend time in his book my pastor I asked you last weekend how many of you got a stroke you struggle to pray you struggle to read your Bible and all of you about every one of you raised your head it's a sacrifice to do it but it's a sacrifice of love the reason why you are you you struggle so much is because there is all enemy that's trying to keep you from the promises of God he's trying to block you from the promises of God but are you willing to sacrifice your all to get the power back you remember how it was when you first gave your heart to the Lord how that everything Singh knew everything was just perfect why can't you have that why can't you have when you walk back in and all of a sudden you're just like in an oasis in the desert what can't you have that love like your first had don't leave your first laws like the Ephesus church there but go back to that love you know we're willing we're willing to spend time in prayer for a headache we're willing to spend time in prayer for healing we're willing to spend time and for a little maybe petty things we're not willing to sacrifice ourselves on the altar we're not willing and died out all the way because we want to hang on to the world the Prophet said what's the matter today yes he said is that the church has moved its altar down to the basement and he said the only fire that they got is down in the basement hallelujah he said but what the church needs is an upper room old fashioned Pentecostal experience that bring the fire back again I believe you can have that fire I believe you can have that experience but you got to be willing to go all the way you got to draw the line and go all the way with God you got to go like David did and say I'm taking back everything that the devil stole for me you can have that fire back but bring me altar back into its rightful place we're allowed to rebuilt the altar and here here he made fun of all of the worshippers of bail and there was no fire that came down but with Elijah rebuilt the altar and put everything and restored everything back in its place and the fire came down what did it do he was God's approval of the sacrifice but I wonder what about you tonight why don't you let God come down and consume your life and consume your sacrifice if you want to check me on this I got this from Pinterest whatever they call that thing nothing great was ever accomplished without Megan sacrifices boy that's true nothing great was ever accomplished without making sacrifices I hope you bear with me just a moment last month was pastor Appreciation our pastor was out on an evangelistic tour and I didn't give get to give my chance I didn't get my chance to give my normal pastor appreciation speech so I hope you allow me in the month of November sacrifice has given back to God I did it I did some calculations on sacrifice today on these are on the low end so you can add to whatever you want to but I want you to know I'm very much appreciative of our pastor and what he has done for us and done for the kingdom of God [Applause] and we reverence we reverence and respect the gift of God that God has placed in our pastor and we appreciate his sacrifice upon top of sacrifices to preach this gospel and we're counting on him we're counting on him to lead us to the Spirit of Truth that will guide us that will be our comforter we're looking unto Him that will lead us to the true sacrifice but I did some I did some calculations today and you can be dismissed if you want to if I get on your nerves or if I burn you hide a little bit you're welcome to leave and then go hurt my feelings but I did some small calculations that average average driving time to church services weekend after weekend year all the way through the year that a hundred and four hours he spends driving to church normal church service throughout the years he spends three hundred and twelve hours here behind this pulpit he's gone 14 times just this past year so on the low end he spent three hundred and thirty six hours in travel sometimes more he spent two hundred and twenty four hours in meetings in the past year sometimes more depending on who he was paired with so by doing a rough estimate he spent nine hundred and seventy six hours roughly a year in church you times that by thirty six years in the ministry thirty-five thousand a hundred and thirty six hours just to be in church but it didn't just start behind the pulpit it started at home so throughout his throughout the year he spends 11 percent of his time just going to church but I'd say 100 percent of the time he's a Christian and I just want to say thank you [Applause] there's no way to calculate the cost they calculate the cost of travel but you say well maybe that's just that's just brother on well let me give you for an instance a brother and a family here I won't call their names so that you don't go ask um all kinds of different things you see one soul is worth ten thousand worlds so no matter the cost the value outweighs the cost but just a certain individual and his family spends two hundred eighty eight hours a year driving the church just driving the church they spent three hundred and twelve hours in service time so throughout the year they have five percent of their year just going to church they spent seventy four roughly seventy four hundred dollars a year in fuel just driving to church once so it's worth a whole lot more that seventy four hundred dollars a year spent spent that ain't that's 5% of that Christians that Christians year but 100 percent of the time they live in this message you see a lot of people think well man seventy four hundred dollars I could really do something with that but I'd say that for this individual that if it costs them fifty thousand dollars a year they still drive oh the way to get to the house of God no matter the cost it's worth the sacrifice but the held Hildebrandt one time went down to africa and each spent hours upon hours upon hours just getting there he got there he was war slap out and they were supposed to start the meeting as soon as he got there he went to the pastor and he told him say look I'm just wore out I've been traveling there's no way that I could preach tonight the pastor began to tell him well that's fine if who you want to do that but I just want to let you know this but there was a certain individual that has walked a hundred miles just to be in this meeting he said I'll be ready to preach you see we may be Navy and maybe work five minutes from church so 30 minutes for church or an hour from church or hour and a half from church but that is a very little bit two churches over in Europe or in Africa where they walk hundred miles or maybe they've got to get on a train and ride for 17 miles just to get in the house of God but it's a sacrifice but you know if you love what you're doing heat ain't a sacrifice of pain it's a sacrifice of love o Alleluia they don't hurt me to love God I love loving God it's not a painful sacrifice to worship God it's what I love to do we didn't get here by look we didn't get here by chance Full Gospel lighthouse we sacrificed a lot to get here you look all over this church and look at the pillars of this church there was a lot of hours spent in sacrifice building this building a lot of the newcomers come in and they look and think my goodness what a beautiful church but they don't understand the sacrifice that went into building this church hanging this drywall hanging that extra rafter up there that our former pastor almost fell all the way through the baptistry they don't understand the sacrifice of things they don't understand sisters bringing in meals just right before church time just they could have a meal and then turn and have Church right after that they don't understand that now brother Homer Frasier would work on this building he'd spend time working on this building changes clothes get behind the pulpit and preach people don't understand the sacrifice unless they understand or been man so don't take these things for granted that we've always been here you remember we started out in a basement you remember we moved up on the 33 and down the Summit Avenue and God blessed us with this church and good lord willing until the rapture comes this is where we're going to be and time let's hold them protocol's come like I believe they're coming and they pack this place out and we have to rent Jair new but I'll say if we got a rich amu it's worth the sacrifice it's worth the cost I want you to know I'm not giving up and I'm not turning back I'm preaching this till the kingdom comes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] romans twelve and one says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service all those sacrifices throughout the years throughout day in and day out they were at the end of the day they were dead sacrifices and God is a God he is a spirit he was not in need physically of the meat offering but he it was a commandment to them to offer it up these were just did sacrifices but now he wants to live in sacrifice somebody that believes that he's worth living for somebody that believes in sacrifice and they're all sacrificing their energies love was the sacrifice of your life not just a dead animal on the altar he wants you on the altar his brother Jason said a couple weekends ago God don't want you peace-pipe and he don't want your cigarettes because God don't smoke he wants you on the altar he wants you to love he wants your commitment he wants your service he wants your sacrifice the Bible says in Deuteronomy 6 and 5 and that shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might you know God will take anything that you don't put on the altar God didn't come down in the midst of the congregation of Israel and consume all the Lambs that were in there in the midst of their fields but he came down and he consumed the sacrifice that was upon the altar God's not gonna push you around and he's not gonna push you on the altar and he's not just gonna come down and push through a pipe and say blessed is he that overcometh but God wants you on that altar he ain't gonna just come down and snatch your dirty habits from you you got to die hello God wants you on the altar he wants you dying on the altar well God I give you my hands but I can't give you nothin else you can have my hands and I don't even lay my own feet up here on the altar so that you can dance through my feet I even leave my mark upon the altar oh you can have my mind but don't take my heart God don't want just part of you on the altar he wants all of you and you go to kick it in screaming oh it's so hard to get I just you know I just don't know people don't understand what sacrifice it is for me to get lay myself on the altar he don't want just part of you he wants all of you yeah he wants your top yeah what's your energy yes he wants your mind yes he wants your feet yes he wants your spirit he wants every part of you you need to grab hold of their horns of the altar and you need to grab ahold of them and pull yourself all the way up and you need to get yourself all the way up there and get good and dead and we can have ourselves a funeral service for the old man he was good he always he always said nice things when everybody was around but when other when they walked away man he could gossip he was good for nothing he was a deadbeat he hardly came to church on time he snuck in 15 minutes late so he missed the singing and the offering so he wouldn't have to give his ties oh but thank God the old man's dead and there's a new man living you know that wasn't old man in there but he don't live there no more he killed off his malice and his strife and he put on the new man that old dead man was good-for-nothing he lied and he cheated and he stole but the new man he walks a little bit different now he talks a little bit different now because why he got his whole self up on the altar he didn't care who was around he didn't care who laughed he didn't care who mocked but he sacrificed his whole entire being to Almighty God tonight if that's you come I invite you to have a funeral service if you're tired of living in captivity of your mind and living in depression living in sin coming let us have a funeral service I want to invite you to the king of kings and the Lord of lords that'll make you dress right make you talk right he said well I don't know how to shout let me tell you put the new man old and he'll shout through you but I don't know how to give two percent I say put the new man old he'll take care of that 10% you won't be a robber no more it is more blessed to give than it is to receive you got time one more story it sounds like we're gonna have a part to all this you are very familiar for the story of blind bartimaeus how the Prophet would tell about blind Bartimaeus Halden how that he would make his living how that he had those two turtledoves had those two turtledoves that he would set down by the gate he would go down by the gate and he would have his turtle doves and they wouldn't make a little tricks and fly around in the air and flip around and people would throw money down at his feet that was the only source of income that he had sitting down in her bagging and those turtle doves we would bring him they would bring in income for him and his family but the Prophet said that one night that his wife got sick to her to a spot that when when blind bartimaeus went home he went into his prayer clothes and he began to pray and he says God God if you heal my wife in the morning I'll go up and all I offer my turtle doves and that's exactly what God did is he come down and healed his wife and blind Bartimaeus was good as his word he went up the next morning and he offered up his two turtledoves his only source of income but in those days there was no such thing as a as a as a blind leading dog as we have today but he had a lamb that would lead him that lamb was his eyes that lamb would take him through the gate and the lamb would take him back home it was his eyesight he would lead him through the city and he would go and he went back home and his daughter was at a point of death he went into his bread clothes and he prayed to God and said God if you'll heal my daughter I'll go up to the temple and I offer up my eyes I'll offer up my lamb and God come down and healed his daughter and restored her life back to her and bombard Emmaus went up the next morning to the temple to offer up his lamb that was his eyes and the Prophet said that when he coming to the temple nakai offices was here and he said bartimaeus he said what's she doing he said I've come here to offer up my lamb Caiaphas has said Bartimaeus you can't do that that lamb is your eyes you won't be able to go through the city no more if you offer abyss lehem he said I'll tell you what brought him here he said I'll give you money and you can go buy you another lamb and come back and sacrifice him he saw Caiaphas isn't no he said I didn't offer Hyden all for God a lamb he said I offer god this lamb how offer God this land God don't want your money God don't want your flowers God hallelujah God would chew on the altar thank God was as good to bartemaeus as my romance was good to God that one day the Lamb of God came by his way Oh hallelujah and he gave him a brand new set of eyes because he recognized the power of their sacrifice that it was worth everything hallelujah you may be in that spot that the Son of Man is walking past you but let this moment pass you by you may need your eyesight enlightened but I say cry out the more somebody may tell you to be quiet somebody may tell you that you're getting too much emotion you're getting more you're getting more attention than the preachers are getting but cry out the more the people around him said hush up he's done pasture but all Bartimaeus cried out the more that son of David have mercy on me he's passing mile this way are you willing are you willing to offer him your whole self his sickness and in health the good times and bad times whether rich or poor where do you live in a shack or you live in a mansion how you're willing to give it all the sacrifice came and the sacrifice didn't hold nothing back it was not a Roman spear that took away the life of Jesus and it was not the Jewish people that took away the life of Jesus for jesus said no man no man could take my life from me but Jesus gave His life friendly Oh hallelujah he sacrificed his life when no man could take his life he gave his life because he thought you were worth the sacrifice he thought that you were worth advancing I hope you feel in your heart when I feel here this moment I wonder I wonder if we would just give a little bit more I wonder if we just give a little bit more time a little bit more energy a little bit more praise a little bit more praise a little bit more time the Bible says I'm bringing it down in Hebrews 13 and 15 that by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name last month was pastor appreciation but let me tell you this month is the month of November is the month of Thanksgiving we're moving into a time of Thanksgiving next next week but let me just offer you up something right here I want to give thanks to you for all of your time for all of your energies for spending your time and prayer for spending your energies in worship and then the atmosphere and the sacrifice of praise I want to say to you four gospel lighthouse thank you thank you for your praise it's just the mortal lips of man saying this but I want to say to you that one of these days that you're going to hear the voice of God say well done [Applause] but let it be from our lips that we offer the sacrifice of praise continually let it not be just when you feel good a win you're full of energy there's a lot of times you come the house of God and you're just making you know what I'm just not into it tonight I got a headache and I you know I just I can't worship when I got a headache the Bible says sacrifice of praise continually no matter if you feel up no matter if you feel down it's a sacrifice of praise you may have a lot of battle scars let me point out somebody you may have a lot of battle scars brother Jordan but you're still praising God you might have a lot of battle scars sister Charlene but you're still praising God you may have a lot of battle scars wrong Spencer but you're still praising God what about you Church you may have been through the muck and you may have been through the mind let us offer up the sacrifice of praise you got to be willing to give it [Applause] brake fluid seems like but I want you to make a sacrifice you got to give up something to have a breakthrough you got to give up your mats give up your energy I'm not telling you get rid of the mass but I'm talking to you about breaking through those medicines and sacrifice yourself and give praise to God well there's people around me they just won't just won't worship God show em what it's like to worship you know I just can't have a breakthrough because this person's talking all service why don't you show them how to a man in the word why don't you show them your sacrifice of praise I've watched you I watched through through your sicknesses how you came here when I knew you didn't feel like it when I knew that you didn't have the energy to do it but through the plane through the Stars the enemy was breathing down your neck but through all of that Oh God I will lift up the voice of Thanksgiving in the house of God I will offer to me offer the sacrifice of priests there's power in your sacrifice it's a sacrifice it makes you free it's a sacrifice that makes you home it's a sacrifice and washes away all your sin you understand that the children of Israel when they were worshiping God after after they come out of Egypt and they were down there on the Red Sea and Miriam and all them sisters are down there on the banks of the Red Sea and they were praising God yes they were free from their captivity yes they were free from their bondage yes they were free from their slavery yes they were free from their taskmasters but they were not free of sin when David come dancing 17 miles backwards he danced so much that he danced his clothes right off of him David was dancing with lust still on him David was dancing with sin still on him if David and them could dance under the sacrifice of the blood of bulls and goats when there was only a covering of their sin and did not remit their sin what about you and I under the perfect sacrifice you can dance free from guilt you can dance free from your mistakes you can shout you can shout and offer up a praise because you're free from your sin you can sing like a bird because there ain't no shame on you the Bible says there are therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus there is therefore amen now now now now amen they were is there for now amen you believe that there is there for now not somewhere in the future no condemnation tell me if you're in Christ Jesus how can you be condemned when he paid the ultimate sacrifice for you how can you have condemnation on you there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's why you could see you think about the dust on that create it when they were worshiping God they were worshipping under the blood of an actual lamb but you're not worshiping under the blood of just a natural lamb your bread your worshiping under those blood of the lamb of Almighty God and Satan has whispered in your ear that you have no rights he is my right he is my authority I got every right to praise God it may be a sacrifice for you but if you could just Oh get in the spirit of it I was reading to the young people this past week over in a church age book of getting in the spirit brother Branham said that if you would get in the spirit of Isaiah 53 you would recognize he said even though you may have pain and you may have you may have these different things or ailments but in his spirit it's all over you may feel you may remember the things that you've done but in his spirit it is all over how you say these words there is power it must sacrifice let the musicians come there's power my sacrifice he made away from me he made a way for you
