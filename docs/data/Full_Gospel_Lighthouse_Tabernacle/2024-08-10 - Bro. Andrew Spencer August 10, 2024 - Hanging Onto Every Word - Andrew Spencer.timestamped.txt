[39:47] believe those meetings will be a

[39:50] supernatural element of uh of all the
[39:53] events of the meetings just coming
[39:55] together I I tell you we were we were in
[39:57] very uh Heavenly places and we seen some
[40:00] mighty things people that people and
[40:03] young young men and young women given
[40:05] their heart to the Lord and just moved
[40:07] and the Lord just moved in a very
[40:08] Sovereign way and we're just thankful
[40:11] that we could go and be a be able to be
[40:13] a a benefit to the kingdom of God and
[40:16] amen we we bring greetings from Brother
[40:18] Tom and brother Michael and we just had
[40:20] a wonderful time in uh in the in the
[40:23] word of the Lord and I know you'd be
[40:24] very proud of your pastor and he did a
[40:26] he did a phenomenal job and and uh the
[40:29] Lord used him in a very special way and
[40:31] brother Ron's got a very unique gift and
[40:34] uh we're certainly privileged to call
[40:36] him our pastor here so amen if you have
[40:40] your Bibles this evening we'd like to uh
[40:42] look over in a couple portions of
[40:48] scripture man there's so many things
[40:49] that we could say say about the meetings
[40:52] and to uh just to witness it all it was
[40:56] uh very special special they uh brother
[40:59] Michael and their their team they put on
[41:02] a theme every year at their camp
[41:04] and and
[41:06] uh just to see how the Lord had aligned
[41:09] us as ministers to just to say some
[41:11] things and Minister on some thoughts
[41:13] brother Ron's brother Ron's series of
[41:16] sermons that he spoke in those meetings
[41:18] were let us run and that was a theme of
[41:21] let us run uh in that camp so it was
[41:24] very it was very special to to be a part
[41:27] of those things and we realize that God
[41:30] is in the details of all of all that we
[41:32] do and if we could realize just how how
[41:35] important that we are how how that every
[41:38] word that we speak and sometimes you
[41:40] don't even know why you say things but
[41:42] you could just see the spirit of God
[41:44] that works that works on the front side
[41:47] and on the back side of everything that
[41:48] he aligns he aligns everything with his
[41:51] word for a certain season for a certain
[41:53] time and I just I just think it's very I
[41:56] think it's very um pertinent for us as
[41:58] Believers to catch the very mind of God
[42:00] of where we are and in the season that
[42:03] we're in and when you see those things
[42:05] lining up it it certainly it certainly
[42:08] is a blessing amen amen the Bible uh
[42:11] we'd like to look here uh in in the
[42:13] Bible in 1 Timothy chapter 6 and 12 and
[42:16] then Luke chapter 19 and verse 46 and
[42:20] just like to draw a thought here tonight
[42:22] out of these out of these
[42:24] scriptures and uh while you're turning
[42:26] there we like to uh just speak to the
[42:28] author of the word and I know that we've
[42:30] got many many needs here that are
[42:33] amongst us and I know that uh uh you all
[42:36] are aware of this by now that brother
[42:37] Joe had to cancel uh the the later
[42:40] portion of of his uh camp meeting there
[42:43] in Ruth and uhu so we just want to be
[42:46] remembering them they had several uh
[42:48] sick cases that arose and I know there's
[42:50] others that were there that that uh that
[42:53] got sick and different things and so we
[42:55] just want to be remembering them and
[42:57] it's not an easy thing to cancel a
[42:59] meeting so we we certainly uh admonish
[43:01] brother Joe and uh in following the
[43:04] leading of the Lord in that matter and
[43:06] uh so we realize that there could be
[43:08] some disappointments in humanity but we
[43:10] realize this that there is no
[43:11] disappointment in almighty God and I I
[43:14] know this that if if maybe you were
[43:16] planning to go to those meetings and you
[43:18] feel like you were you were maybe robbed
[43:20] of a blessing I I just want you to know
[43:21] that God is not that kind of a God God
[43:24] is the kind of God that pays he pays his
[43:27] dividends and he's not the kind of God
[43:29] that we will be disappointed in we might
[43:31] get disappointed in humanity but we
[43:33] shall never be disappointed in Elohim
[43:35] himself so we realize that he's all
[43:38] sufficient and we realize that he's
[43:39] mindful of every single one of the the
[43:41] Believers that put monies and invested
[43:44] in different things and I believe that
[43:45] God will return it back to every one of
[43:48] those brothers and I pray God would just
[43:50] bless our brother Joe we just want to
[43:52] admonish him and from from our hearts
[43:54] here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we
[43:56] certainly love him and and appreciate
[43:58] him with all that is within us amen
[44:00] let's just let's just speak to the Lord
[44:02] tonight as we get ready to delve into
[44:04] the word here Heavenly Father we come
[44:07] before you Lord one more time we have
[44:09] gathered as your children Lord here in
[44:11] the
[44:12] presence Lord of not just not just
[44:16] regular men and women but these are Sons
[44:18] and Daughters of God that have been
[44:20] called and ordained and elected before
[44:22] the foundation of the world but Lord
[44:25] more than just being in the presence of
[44:27] Sons we realize that we are in the
[44:29] presence of The Great I Am and Lord we
[44:31] just ask that the lord of the word would
[44:33] come tonight and you would just stretch
[44:36] forth your bow of the Holy Ghost and be
[44:38] able to bring it back and forth across a
[44:41] word that it would speak a rhythm of the
[44:44] Holy Spirit to our hearts that we would
[44:47] find the very channel of the holy spirit
[44:49] that you have asked us to be in and I
[44:52] pray father that you would just take us
[44:54] into special places here tonight Lord
[44:57] something that has been spoken to me
[44:59] this past week Lord that I have I have
[45:02] looked into this week and I pray that
[45:03] you would give me liberty to be able to
[45:05] speak these things father that you have
[45:08] placed on My Heart Lord and I pray that
[45:11] you would just allow your children
[45:12] tonight Lord to be able to let
[45:14] themselves go in the Supernatural that
[45:16] they could find the promises of God are
[45:19] for them in this moment for every sick
[45:21] person that is amongst us for every
[45:23] uplifted request and every uplifted hand
[45:26] and every unspoken request we ask that
[45:28] the that the lord of the host would come
[45:32] amongst us and you would begin to bless
[45:34] your children abundantly by the grace of
[45:37] God I pray that you do these things Lord
[45:40] and we'll be careful to serve you as we
[45:42] get out of the way just now we pray that
[45:44] you would have the preeminence in this
[45:45] service in the name of Jesus Christ and
[45:48] the bride says amen 1 Timothy chapter 6
[45:52] and verse
[45:54] 12 Paul in his letter here to Timothy
[45:57] says fight the good fight of faith and
[46:00] lay hold on eternal life where unto Thou
[46:03] Art also called and has professed a good
[46:06] profession before many witnesses I give
[46:09] thee charge in the sight of God who
[46:12] quickeneth all things and before Christ
[46:15] Jesus who before Pontius Pilate
[46:18] witnessed a good confession that thou
[46:21] keep this commandment without spot
[46:24] unrebuked unto the appearing of our Lord
[46:27] Jesus Christ also Luke chap 19 and verse
[46:38] 46 I've always loved the love these
[46:43] words but after this week of study I I
[46:46] don't think that I'll ever read them the
[46:50] same Luke chapter 19 and verse
[46:53] 46 saying unto them it is written my
[46:57] house is the House of Prayer but you
[47:00] have made it a denes and just to catch
[47:02] your mind in this in this drama here
[47:05] that this is when Jesus has just come
[47:08] down off off of the mount and he's wept
[47:11] for he's wept for Jerusalem he comes in
[47:14] he he comes in there and he sees the
[47:16] house of God as it's been as it's been
[47:19] made into a a den of Thieves they're
[47:22] bringing in monies and different things
[47:24] and Jesus gets it gets upset and spirit
[47:27] and he begins to flip over tables and
[47:29] all of these things and Jesus begins to
[47:31] say these words it is written my house
[47:33] is the House of Prayer but you made it a
[47:36] den of Thieves and I love this and he
[47:39] taught daily in the temple but the CH
[47:42] Chief priest and the scribes and the
[47:44] chief of the people sought to destroy
[47:46] him and could not find what they might
[47:49] do for all the people were very
[47:53] attentive to hear him very attentive
[47:57] to hear him may God bless his word you
[47:59] may be seated tonight in the presence of
[48:01] the Lord we are just coming from a camp
[48:05] as we've just spoken these things to you
[48:08] where we have witnessed the supernatural
[48:10] element of the Lord and how all the
[48:12] meetings and everything was aligned and
[48:15] and God ordained that meeting from start
[48:17] to finish and on let us run and and we
[48:20] were allowed to we went was able to
[48:23] spend some time with our brother Bisal
[48:25] and and I got permission to be able to
[48:27] say these things tonight and and so but
[48:30] we were we were spending we just spent a
[48:31] few minutes with our brother Bisal and
[48:34] he looked at me and he he he just said
[48:36] these words he these words he said we're
[48:37] hanging on to every word we're hanging
[48:40] on to every word and as soon as our
[48:42] brother Bisal begin to say those words
[48:44] to me the preacher on the inside of me
[48:46] started to go to work and and and I have
[48:50] I have spent some very very specific
[48:53] times on this on this on this thought
[48:55] this weekend or this week and I'd like
[48:58] to bring some of these things that the
[48:59] Lord has has dealt with me on on this
[49:03] thought and I here I was I was thinking
[49:05] here's here's a brother that we have
[49:06] held with the utmost esteem as as a man
[49:10] that has preached this message without
[49:11] favor and without Fain he has stood here
[49:14] in this Pulpit he stood around the world
[49:17] and I was thinking a man that's some 90
[49:19] years old could still be preaching to us
[49:21] even here today and I'd like to just
[49:23] maybe take a thought and just build it
[49:25] up here on hanging on to every word and
[49:29] out of those meetings out of those
[49:30] meetings I I could say that we literally
[49:33] witnessed a a a group of kids and a
[49:36] group of Believers that were literally
[49:38] hanging on to the very Supernatural
[49:40] elements that they were being a part of
[49:42] and they were witnessing and that word
[49:44] to hang on to every word it means to
[49:47] extremely it means to pay extremely
[49:49] close to attention to what someone is
[49:52] saying often because of information or
[49:55] is very important or interesting it
[49:58] suggests that the listener is very
[50:01] engaged and attentive absorbing every
[50:04] detail of the conversation and we
[50:07] realize that there are certain elements
[50:09] there are certain people that have the
[50:11] ability to be able to hold a a
[50:13] congregation or hold a crowd or hold a
[50:16] space of people and hold them in the
[50:18] grips of their hands by just by just
[50:21] speaking words and you can you can
[50:23] literally see as people are sitting
[50:25] there as they're they're hanging on
[50:27] every word that is coming off of the
[50:30] orator lips and we find there's many
[50:33] many different many different Bible
[50:35] characters that we could look at
[50:36] throughout the Bible and it would for it
[50:39] time would fail us if we would go
[50:40] through and we would look at all the
[50:42] characters that would spend time if we'd
[50:44] look at it on men and women that would
[50:46] literally hang on the word of God just
[50:49] like Mary the mother of Jesus when the
[50:51] angel Gabriel begin to appear unto her
[50:53] and begin to say certain things that
[50:55] you're going to conceive a a child and
[50:57] you're going to be you're going to
[50:59] conceive a child that will be of the
[51:00] Holy Ghost and she responded with
[51:03] complete trust in God's word and she
[51:06] looked upon the angel Gabriel and said
[51:09] be it unto me according to the word of
[51:11] God she look she literally hung her
[51:14] entire soul as an absolute on the word
[51:17] of God she hung everything that she had
[51:20] on the word of God to think that the
[51:22] angel Gabriel could take her from a spot
[51:24] of natural to a place of the
[51:27] Supernatural and she would literally
[51:29] hang her entire soul upon the word of
[51:31] God even David as we would look at King
[51:34] David he's another example of someone
[51:36] who clung on to God's word and David
[51:39] would Express that in in different
[51:41] Psalms and in different words that he
[51:43] would Express the Deep resilience and
[51:45] Reliance that he had upon the
[51:47] Commandments of God's word because the
[51:49] Bible said in Psalms 119 and 105 that
[51:52] your word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[51:55] light to my
[51:57] that David it shows us that David
[51:59] constantly sought to live according to
[52:02] God's word it is it's no it's no secret
[52:05] to us as Believers as Bible Believers
[52:07] that the Apostle Paul he hung on to
[52:10] God's word with Incredible in
[52:13] tenacity despare despite facing immense
[52:16] persecution and hardship he encouraged
[52:19] others to do the same thing by writing
[52:21] in Colossians 3 and16 let the word of
[52:24] Christ dwell in you richly and all
[52:26] wisdom wisdom teaching and admonishing
[52:28] one another in Psalms and hymns and
[52:30] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[52:32] your hearts to the Lord and not
[52:34] whatsoever you do in word or In Deed do
[52:37] it all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:39] Christ giving thanks to God and the
[52:42] father by him you see Paul would write
[52:44] out letters and he would write out his
[52:46] very he would write out his very
[52:48] emotions and he would exhort the
[52:50] Brethren to cling upon the word of God
[52:53] and upon the teachings of Christ and
[52:55] Paul would give his very own life as he
[52:58] was hanging on to the word of God in his
[53:01] day and his age he was living and
[53:03] hanging on that his age was the age of
[53:06] rapture because God did not release that
[53:08] unto him but he was clinging on to it
[53:11] with everything that was within him
[53:13] Daniel was a man who exemplified
[53:15] unwavering faith in God's word even when
[53:18] he fac when he was faced with
[53:20] lifethreatening when he would stand
[53:22] there in life-threatening situations
[53:25] Daniel was a man that had his resolve
[53:27] and he was committed unto the faith of
[53:29] almighty God that even when there came
[53:32] out a a a capital uh punishment that if
[53:35] any man would would bow and pray to
[53:37] anybody else except for the King Daniel
[53:40] didn't care but his trust was solely
[53:43] upon the word of God even though they
[53:45] would send him to a lion's den Daniel
[53:48] fully trusted that the word of God would
[53:51] sustain him and he was literally hanging
[53:54] on the word of God that God was was more
[53:56] than able to get him out of the Lion's
[53:58] Den that he was more than able and even
[54:00] in that tenacity and even in that
[54:02] Despair and even in that conflict these
[54:05] men and these women had the power to
[54:08] believe there was something on the
[54:10] inside of them that was empowering them
[54:13] to hang on to every word of God and I
[54:16] believe that I believe as Christians
[54:18] that's what we ought to do I believe
[54:20] that we don't we shouldn't just read the
[54:22] word of God as just a as a newspaper I
[54:25] don't believe that we should read it as
[54:26] a magazine or as Facebook or some
[54:29] something but I believe that we ought to
[54:30] hinge our entire and our entire Eternal
[54:34] destination upon the word of God because
[54:36] men's word will fail us but God's word
[54:39] won't fail us Facebook will fail us that
[54:42] Fox News will fail us CNN will fail us
[54:45] all the things of the world will fail us
[54:47] but God's word has never failed it is
[54:50] always been infallible it has always
[54:52] been unfailing in every aspect of the
[54:55] word of God it has never let down and it
[54:58] is never backed off of its
[55:00] promises now the prophet would say this
[55:03] and let your light so shine he said now
[55:05] he said only way that we see Christ is
[55:08] when he reflects in each other he said I
[55:10] see Christ in you you see him and me he
[55:13] said that's how we watch Christ he said
[55:15] I come to the meeting I start preaching
[55:17] I watch the people you can see whether
[55:19] they're interested or not just a few
[55:21] minutes you look over the audience and
[55:23] you can tell whether you're boring them
[55:25] or or not he said and the first thing
[55:28] that you know he said you see them
[55:30] sitting there hanging on to every word
[55:33] under expectation see I'm seeing Christ
[55:36] reflected in that person because he's
[55:39] hungering and thirsting for God and then
[55:41] me preaching the gospel sees Christ
[55:43] reflecting in me I can see Christ
[55:46] reflecting in him he said that means
[55:49] that Christ is in our midst see a man
[55:52] hungering and thirsting so we can
[55:55] recognize simply by by your expression
[55:59] of Faith by amening the word of God and
[56:01] hungering upon it and thirsting for more
[56:03] of God and by the by the preacher
[56:06] getting under the atmosphere of it we
[56:08] can literally recognize that Christ is
[56:11] in our midst when somebody gets
[56:13] interested in what the word is saying
[56:16] and the preacher preacher gets into the
[56:18] atmosphere of his gift you can literally
[56:22] understand that Christ is in the midst
[56:24] of us I hope you understand what I'm
[56:27] saying to you is that is that if there's
[56:30] something that's on the inside of you
[56:32] that maybe you have had a bad day maybe
[56:34] you've had some very tormental times in
[56:37] your life that maybe maybe the maybe the
[56:39] singing board you maybe the song
[56:42] specials didn't come out and just bless
[56:44] you the way that you thought they would
[56:46] but all of a sudden the preaching of the
[56:48] word captures your attention and you're
[56:51] held spell by Spellbound by the word of
[56:53] God you're literally hanging up it and
[56:56] you see that the preacher gets under the
[56:58] atmosphere or under the anointing of it
[57:01] you literally watch Christ come into the
[57:03] midst of the Church of the Living God
[57:05] because Jesus would say it like this
[57:07] that the Bible would say that every man
[57:11] it is written that every man shall not
[57:12] live by bread alone but by every word
[57:15] that proceeds out of the mouth of
[57:18] God so when you see men begin to hunger
[57:22] and thirst for almighty God it shows you
[57:25] that Christ is in the midst of the
[57:27] Church of the Living God now notice what
[57:29] what the scripture said in Luke 19- 48
[57:32] that the Bible said that the people were
[57:34] very attentive to hear him if you look
[57:38] that word up in the Greek it means to
[57:41] hang from that means to hang from there
[57:46] was there was never any lack of crowds
[57:48] Around
[57:51] Jesus there was never any lack of crowds
[57:54] Around Jesus there was crowd s that were
[57:57] literally clinging to him and hanging
[57:59] upon his words that word it's rendered
[58:02] it attentive it means it signifies that
[58:05] they heard him with great eagerness and
[58:08] diligence and were ready to catch every
[58:11] word that dropped from his lips you can
[58:14] just imagine as he would gather the
[58:16] children in as he would gather them up
[58:19] on the mountain and he would take them
[58:20] through the Beatitudes and he would
[58:22] preach one of the greatest sermons
[58:24] that's ever been preached you can
[58:26] imagine William Brandon would say it
[58:28] like this he said to understand the
[58:31] supernatural element about Jesus's voice
[58:34] that he could speak and 5,000 people
[58:36] would hear him that he's standing there
[58:39] and people are literally hanging upon
[58:42] his words just waiting for the next word
[58:44] to come off of his
[58:47] lips they were
[58:49] exceedingly taken with him now there was
[58:52] a lot of other teachers in the Land
[58:54] There was a a lot of different prophets
[58:56] that was in the Land There was a lot of
[58:59] another anointed people in the land the
[59:01] prophet would say that there had already
[59:03] been jesuses before Jesus Christ that
[59:06] had already been prophets before Jesus
[59:09] Christ but the Bibles would tell us that
[59:12] no man spake like this man that these
[59:15] people had gathered around not just to
[59:18] be around the person not just to be
[59:20] around another teacher not just to be
[59:22] around another Prophet but they were
[59:24] literally standing
[59:26] in the presence of Elohim in
[59:31] flesh the prophet would say it in token
[59:34] in the message token he said apply and
[59:36] create an atmosphere around you that
[59:39] they'll just drop right into it he said
[59:42] oh you are if you've got the token you
[59:45] create a spirit around you a power that
[59:49] when you walk people know that you're a
[59:52] Christian they love for you to say
[59:54] something to them
[1:00:01] they love for you to say something to
[1:00:06] them woo they love for you to say
[1:00:09] something to them they believe your word
[1:00:12] what you say they hold on to it so I
[1:00:15] believe that if we've got that much
[1:00:17] influence if we've got that much T power
[1:00:20] that the choken life of Jesus Christ is
[1:00:23] on the inside of us that people liter
[1:00:26] love for us to speak to them I believe
[1:00:29] that we ought to handle our words a
[1:00:31] little bit differently I don't believe
[1:00:33] that we ought to just spat off at the
[1:00:34] mouth I don't believe that we ought to
[1:00:36] just say things halfhazard I don't think
[1:00:39] that we ought to just go by Impressions
[1:00:41] but I believe that we ought to put
[1:00:42] something on our lips I believe that we
[1:00:45] ought to ordain and AD have adoration
[1:00:48] for the holy spirit that we would
[1:00:51] entertain his presence that
[1:00:54] unbelievers that skeptic
[1:00:56] that critics that people that do not
[1:00:59] walk the way of a Christian would
[1:01:01] literally long for you to say something
[1:01:04] to
[1:01:05] them come on somebody this has taking
[1:01:08] you past just your work past just your
[1:01:11] job past just a preacher pass just a
[1:01:13] leoty but this put you in position as a
[1:01:17] Son of God that people literally hold on
[1:01:21] to the
[1:01:24] words Hallelujah
[1:01:26] I know I I feel that atmosphere building
[1:01:28] right here that people are literally
[1:01:31] waiting for the next word to drop I've
[1:01:35] studied I've looked I've prayed about it
[1:01:38] but sometimes as a minister let me put
[1:01:40] you under the let me put you where you
[1:01:43] can see it from my eyes just for a
[1:01:44] minute I have studied I have looked at
[1:01:47] it I've looked at the word of God I have
[1:01:50] a Direction but you don't necessarily
[1:01:52] know
[1:01:53] that you don't know the direction and
[1:01:56] sometimes the spirit of God begins to
[1:01:57] use a
[1:01:59] man and he gets under the influence of
[1:02:02] the holy spirit that men and women are
[1:02:05] literally waiting on the word of God to
[1:02:08] drop out of their mouth to heal their
[1:02:12] bodies come on somebody to heal your
[1:02:14] mind to heal your broken heart to heal
[1:02:17] you that people are literally Hallelujah
[1:02:21] I believe that if Ministry could look at
[1:02:23] it in that aspect that the words that
[1:02:26] drop out of our mouth could literally
[1:02:28] heal somebody that could literally bring
[1:02:31] that could literally bring power to a
[1:02:33] situation they could deliver somebody
[1:02:35] from
[1:02:38] change we're L hallelujah we're hanging
[1:02:41] on this message we're hanging onto the
[1:02:44] sayith the
[1:02:52] Lord Brother Brandon would say it's like
[1:02:54] a love affair
[1:02:57] he said if you was going with a girl
[1:02:59] because you knew it was your duty or you
[1:03:01] going with a boy when you're young he
[1:03:03] said just because your mama wants you to
[1:03:05] go with that guy he said but you can't
[1:03:07] stand him you don't get nothing out of
[1:03:09] him coming to see you he said oh it's
[1:03:12] the same way about a girl to the boy or
[1:03:13] the boy to the girl you go with her but
[1:03:16] she bores you but mama wants you to go
[1:03:18] with her because it's this type she's
[1:03:20] this type of a girl that mama likes see
[1:03:23] it bores you it's not a love affair but
[1:03:26] you don't care you don't want to clean
[1:03:27] up you don't want to go to see her it's
[1:03:29] why it's a horrible thing when he is
[1:03:31] coming to see you my he just wish you
[1:03:34] just wish he would hurry on and go on
[1:03:36] home he said that's the same way it is
[1:03:39] he said when you why does he preach so
[1:03:41] long what about all this stuff and
[1:03:43] everything see you're not in love but
[1:03:46] when you really hang on to every word as
[1:03:48] the spirit would give warning this
[1:03:50] morning hang on to every word that that
[1:03:53] might be what he has been talking you
[1:03:56] about holding on it's eternal life every
[1:03:59] word of God it's a joy to go to church
[1:04:01] under any

[1:04:06] under any circumstance whether it's hot
[1:04:09] cold indiff whether the people are
[1:04:10] fussing growling whatever they're doing
[1:04:13] it's still a joy to hear the word of the
[1:04:14] Lord then you're in love with Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ then you love to go to church not

[1:04:29] you're really in love you can't wait
[1:04:32] till Sunday Morning Comes you just got
[1:04:34] to get down there with
[1:04:38] them it's a love affair there's
[1:04:41] something about being the brown
[1:04:42] Believers as the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] with brothers and sisters that are
[1:04:47] uniting under the same Faith under the
[1:04:49] same Oneness under the same
[1:04:53] power what is it It's A Love Affair you

[1:04:59] you don't hate being here with them but

[1:05:08] and you're bored you're not going to the
[1:05:11] right church if you're going to this
[1:05:13] church and you're bored you're not
[1:05:15] feeding on the message of the hour if
[1:05:18] you're in this church and you're
[1:05:21] bored you need to get in love with Jesus
[1:05:24] because this message is none other than
[1:05:28] Jesus
[1:05:35] Christ
[1:05:37] Hallelujah you begin to look at Christ
[1:05:40] when Jesus comes and you watch
[1:05:44] immediately how fast his ministry
[1:05:47] progressed the popularity and the fame
[1:05:50] that got behind it this is a man that's
[1:05:53] this is a man that's only had in his
[1:05:56] lifetime he's only had three and a half
[1:05:57] years of
[1:05:58] ministry but he draws Thrones and crowds
[1:06:02] and men from every aspect of life from
[1:06:05] the high and the low he grabs them by
[1:06:08] his words his popularity would grow and
[1:06:12] the Bible would say it like this that
[1:06:14] the people were astonished at his
[1:06:16] Doctrine for his word was with power
[1:06:19] again it would say that he taught them
[1:06:21] as one that had Authority his hearers
[1:06:23] wanted to know when does this man have
[1:06:26] this wisdom the officers of the
[1:06:29] Sanhedrin declared that never a man
[1:06:32] spake like this man his enemy's purpose
[1:06:35] was defeated when they said they could
[1:06:38] not find what they might do for all the
[1:06:41] people were very attentative of him he
[1:06:43] didn't have to seek an audience an
[1:06:45] audience seek him he didn't have to seek
[1:06:48] a place to preach from he had to seek a
[1:06:51] place to
[1:06:53] hide because the very all all they
[1:06:56] needed was one word all they needed was
[1:07:00] one line all they needed was one
[1:07:02] sentence and it could change their
[1:07:05] situation if one word had the ability to
[1:07:09] break and send people to a devil's hell
[1:07:12] and break them out of break them into
[1:07:15] bondage and bring them into sin and
[1:07:17] bring them into unbelief how much
[1:07:20] power is in one
[1:07:23] word hallelujah how much power is in one
[1:07:27] word that if we got oursel in this midst
[1:07:30] if Adam and Eve sold us into sin slavery
[1:07:33] by breaking not a sentence not a line
[1:07:37] but one
[1:07:39] word how powerful brother Timothy is
[1:07:42] that one word that's why I believe that
[1:07:45] Believers come here let me say it like
[1:07:48] like Ruth Ruth was looking for one
[1:07:50] handful and maybe you come here looking
[1:07:53] for one word
[1:07:55] maybe you just need him to say over you
[1:07:58] you're healed you're forgiven you're
[1:08:01] Justified you're Sanctified it's over
[1:08:04] maybe you just need that one word I say
[1:08:07] it unto you it's that
[1:08:14] powerful it's h powerful that literally
[1:08:17] this word can literally change your
[1:08:20] destination this word can change your
[1:08:23] spiritual altitude this word can take
[1:08:25] you into Heavenly places am I going to
[1:08:28] am I going too fast for you am I going
[1:08:30] too high for you but I believe
[1:08:32] hallelujah it's by one
[1:08:35] word if he had the power to say Let
[1:08:39] There Be lighted surely has the power to
[1:08:42] say Let Them Be Free let them be healed
[1:08:45] let them overcome surely he's got that
[1:08:47] same power
[1:08:52] tonight nobody had ever spoke like him
[1:08:57] he had the ability to hold thousands
[1:08:59] upon thousands and he would stand there
[1:09:02] and he would simply talk to them about
[1:09:03] the grass he would talk to them about
[1:09:04] natural things he would talk to them
[1:09:06] about the winds and talk to them about
[1:09:08] fair weather and foul weather he would
[1:09:10] talk to them about the fig trees he
[1:09:11] would talk to them about the Ravens he
[1:09:14] would talk to them about The Sparrows
[1:09:16] his words were so natural his words were
[1:09:19] so natural but in a sense he can
[1:09:21] literally bring Heaven to Earth by the
[1:09:24] preaching of Natural Things
[1:09:26] he could bring Heaven down on Earth by
[1:09:28] simply saying certain words in a certain
[1:09:32] way to show what season that the Church
[1:09:35] of the Living God was hanging in and
[1:09:38] people were heading sitting there and
[1:09:40] they were paying close
[1:09:43] attention you know the prophet said that
[1:09:46] our soul is hanging over top of Hell by
[1:09:49] a chain he said and Adam and Eve sold us
[1:09:52] into sin he said what they do they broke
[1:09:54] that one word
[1:09:55] they broke that one word he said and
[1:09:57] that chain that's over top of that is
[1:09:59] the word of God and it's your faith in
[1:10:01] the word of God you see your soul your
[1:10:04] soul is hanging over top of Hell your
[1:10:07] soul is passing over hell hanging on the
[1:10:09] word of God he said so don't let
[1:10:11] somebody squeeze something into you
[1:10:13] that's not safe the
[1:10:16] Lord now
[1:10:19] notice forgive
[1:10:22] me forgive me
[1:10:25] you don't know what it's
[1:10:28] like to be studying something and all of
[1:10:30] a sudden it comes
[1:10:33] alive if you could put yourself in my
[1:10:35] shoes just for a
[1:10:37] minute I've looked at this I've looked
[1:10:40] at these words I've I've held these
[1:10:42] words I've I've prayed these words in my
[1:10:44] prayers i' I've thought about them but
[1:10:46] to watch them come into
[1:10:50] fruition it's more than sometimes we can
[1:10:53] handle because I realize that I'm not
[1:10:55] just dropping this this word off just to
[1:10:58] anybody but I'm dropping this word to
[1:11:02] bride Believers I'm dropping this word
[1:11:04] off to a people that believe God that
[1:11:07] have held on to every word and you
[1:11:11] literally understand the moment that
[1:11:13] you're
[1:11:16] in don't tell me don't tell me the woman
[1:11:20] that had the blood issue didn't
[1:11:21] understand what the moment that she was
[1:11:23] in when she waited for this moment she'
[1:11:26] heard about it she was hanging if she
[1:11:29] could just touch His Garment she was
[1:11:32] hanging on that moment her faith was
[1:11:36] hanging over top of hell with that one
[1:11:39] word if I can just get to Jesus if I can
[1:11:43] just touch His Garment what about you
[1:11:45] tonight what about you in your situation
[1:11:48] what about you in your life what if you
[1:11:50] could get to Jesus with one
[1:11:52] word with one aspiration of life to say
[1:11:56] let me fight the good fight of Faith so
[1:11:58] I can lay hold on
[1:12:04] it though we know
[1:12:06] this that the word of God Is
[1:12:10] Creative that the Bible would say that
[1:12:12] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:12:14] Word was with God and the Word was God
[1:12:16] the same was in the beginning with God
[1:12:18] all things were made by him and without
[1:12:20] him was not anything made that was made
[1:12:23] Hebrews 11:3 tells us that though
[1:12:26] through faith we understand that the
[1:12:28] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:12:31] that the things which are seen were not
[1:12:33] made of things which do
[1:12:38] appear so when God
[1:12:41] speaks I'm always amazed at people
[1:12:44] that
[1:12:47] that that say that God said all of this
[1:12:51] to
[1:12:52] him when Abraham only had a certain word
[1:12:55] words that were spoken to
[1:12:58] him what I'm trying to say is that God
[1:13:01] doesn't just spout off at the
[1:13:03] mouth and I'm also amazed at people that
[1:13:06] call themselves Christians they can
[1:13:08] quote everything that the devil has told
[1:13:11] them he's told them that they're Liars
[1:13:14] he's he's told them that they'll never
[1:13:16] make it he's told them that their daddy
[1:13:18] died this way and their granddaddy died
[1:13:19] that way and this person died with
[1:13:21] cancer so I I guess I'll die with cancer
[1:13:23] but they can't requote one word
[1:13:26] word so when God is saying something
[1:13:29] he's not just spouting off at the mouth
[1:13:32] but he's literally got intentions with
[1:13:35] his
[1:13:36] word he's got a purpose behind his word
[1:13:39] he's saying something with a
[1:13:43] reason notice what the Bible said that
[1:13:46] in Isaiah 55:11 so shall my word be that
[1:13:49] goth forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:13:51] return unto me void but it shall
[1:13:53] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:13:55] shall prosper in the thing where to I
[1:13:58] sin it so when Jesus is standing there
[1:14:01] Jesus literally proves himself as the
[1:14:04] word of God he proves that he's Elohim
[1:14:07] he proves his position I love what the
[1:14:10] how the prophet said it and when their
[1:14:12] eyes were open he said he said that's
[1:14:15] how the prophets Jesus called them Gods
[1:14:17] he said that's how Jesus proved himself
[1:14:19] and that woman knowed he was a word
[1:14:22] because he could discern the thoughts
[1:14:26] here I think it's amazing that here she
[1:14:28] comes to a well she's a sinner in one
[1:14:31] aspect and all of a sudden Jesus drops
[1:14:33] starts dropping some word and all of a
[1:14:36] sudden she becomes
[1:14:38] religious and then he takes her from a
[1:14:41] sinner to religious to a and shows her
[1:14:45] her predestination in the plan of
[1:14:47] almighty God that she's a very first one
[1:14:50] that he shows himself to that Jesus
[1:14:53] proves that he's the word word of God
[1:14:55] that he could discern the thoughts and
[1:14:58] just like he said it in Luke 17:30 that
[1:15:01] so shall it be in the days of the son of
[1:15:04] man when he begins to reveal the secrets
[1:15:06] of the heart to think what he was doing
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:10] there just like with the boys on the
[1:15:13] road to AAS and they're walking down
[1:15:15] there and their eyes are closed they
[1:15:17] don't understand what's going on and all
[1:15:19] of a sudden it's more than an oror
[1:15:21] that's walking with him down a dusty
[1:15:23] road this is more than just a an
[1:15:25] ordinary man but Elohim is in flesh but
[1:15:28] they don't recognize who this is
[1:15:31] sometimes you're sitting in a service
[1:15:32] and you don't understand who's talking
[1:15:34] to you you don't you just hear the words
[1:15:36] but all of a sudden I love what the
[1:15:38] prophet said he said what does he do to
[1:15:40] your eyes what did he do to your eyes he
[1:15:43] did something to them boys' eyes so that
[1:15:46] they could see that that was Jesus what
[1:15:48] is he done in your day what has he done
[1:15:51] right here with your eyes so that you
[1:15:53] could see that this is more than just a
[1:15:55] prophet's message you could see that
[1:15:57] this is more than just Malachi 4 but you
[1:15:59] could see this is Revelations
[1:16:02] 10 what did he do with your eyes so that
[1:16:06] you could
[1:16:08] see what's he done he showed us who he
[1:16:16] is I love how the prophet would tell it
[1:16:19] in a church age book how that the
[1:16:22] unveiling the unveiling of a scul
[1:16:24] culture that he literally pulls it off
[1:16:28] so that the per person could see it
[1:16:30] clearly right in front of them I want
[1:16:32] you to know that in this hour everything
[1:16:34] has been pulled off so that this body
[1:16:37] move can say that there is nothing that
[1:16:39] is hindering them there is nothing that
[1:16:41] is hidden from them but they could
[1:16:43] literally stand right there they could
[1:16:45] stand right there and could say I'd say
[1:16:47] what what happened to our eyes in this
[1:16:49] generation it allowed us to see a
[1:16:52] message a message that separated us
[1:16:55] a message to come out of her my people a
[1:16:58] message that would say come out repent
[1:17:00] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:17:02] Christ just like it did with faithful
[1:17:04] Abraham that voice separated
[1:17:08] him it separated him from everything
[1:17:11] that he loved everything that he knew
[1:17:13] and Abraham his whole entire experience
[1:17:17] was was hanging on the voice that was
[1:17:21] leading him it led him away from his
[1:17:23] father it led him away from his
[1:17:29] homeland the prophet said it like this
[1:17:32] God separated us from all the dead
[1:17:34] religions he I'm speaking across a
[1:17:36] nation now that all the dead Creeds into
[1:17:39] what he said he separated us and opened
[1:17:42] to us a new land a new message for this
[1:17:44] day he said Pentecostals dried up and
[1:17:46] died like Luther and Wesley and the rest
[1:17:48] of them and Abraham everywhere he went
[1:17:51] brother Jimmy he was walking and he was
[1:17:53] hanging on the word of God he was
[1:17:55] looking to the one that was leading him
[1:17:57] and Abraham he goes through the stages
[1:18:01] of Grace showing God showing
[1:18:04] us through his life the outline that a
[1:18:08] Believer has to walk this way they have
[1:18:10] to go through Genesis 12 they have to go
[1:18:13] through sanctification they have to go
[1:18:15] through Genesis 15 of
[1:18:18] sanctification let me say it like
[1:18:21] this when he was standing there in
[1:18:23] sanctification he was saying is this all
[1:18:26] you've
[1:18:29] got that's what he was saying to him God
[1:18:32] is this all you
[1:18:34] got maybe I'm not reading out of the
[1:18:37] same Bible y'all reading out of that's
[1:18:39] literally what he was saying said Lord
[1:18:41] all that's in my house is elaser is he
[1:18:45] my Heir and God said that's not all I've
[1:18:48] got for you Abraham I've got something
[1:18:50] more for you that your eyes can behold
[1:18:55] and he takes him not not only there but
[1:18:57] he literally takes him to Genesis 17 to
[1:19:00] a spot of being filled with the Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost and adopted and place as a Son of
[1:19:05] God that's what William Brandon would
[1:19:07] say in Abraham's Grace Covenant he' said
[1:19:10] that he justified him Sanctified him by
[1:19:13] the blood of Christ he gave him his own
[1:19:15] life in 17th chapter and the baptism of
[1:19:18] the Holy Ghost now what comes next some
[1:19:20] of you Bible scholars it's the placing
[1:19:22] of a son he stands there he stands there
[1:19:27] in Genesis 17 and he says unto him I am
[1:19:31] the almighty
[1:19:33] God you see what you thought that you
[1:19:36] was powerful enough but he says I am
[1:19:39] your
[1:19:40] sufficiency Abraham was hanging on to
[1:19:44] every word that elhad was speaking unto
[1:19:47] him and he literally nursed his new body
[1:19:51] out of them promises that I am enough
[1:19:55] you might be going through LC and say is
[1:19:58] this message enough and God says I am
[1:20:01] Eli I am more I am more than enough you
[1:20:06] don't have to wonder about you don't
[1:20:08] have to feed on YouTube you don't have
[1:20:10] to feed on Creeds you don't have to feed
[1:20:12] on some watered down gospel out there
[1:20:15] but I am your satisfying
[1:20:21] portion it was enough for Abraham
[1:20:29] it was enough for him brother Randall
[1:20:30] that he could lean his head over on the
[1:20:33] bosom of elshad and he could pull a body
[1:20:36] out of him that he didn't know nothing
[1:20:37] about and he literally pulled on him and
[1:20:40] pulled out a body change I love what the
[1:20:43] prophet said in Jehovah Gyra he said
[1:20:45] while we're waiting and resting in your
[1:20:47] faith take God's promise I believe you
[1:20:49] Lord you promis to give me the baptism
[1:20:51] of the Holy Spirit and I'm resting in
[1:20:53] your faith my faith that I have in you
[1:20:56] I'm drawing from my source my resource
[1:20:58] for my health from your resource the
[1:21:01] word The man shall not live by bread
[1:21:03] alone but by every but out of the bosom
[1:21:06] of God shall he nurse his strength every
[1:21:09] word that comes out of the mouth of God
[1:21:11] shall he receive strength as he comes
[1:21:15] from the mouth of God so
[1:21:18] Abraham was hanging on
[1:21:21] it every
[1:21:23] promise that was promise to the seedline
[1:21:26] of Abraham was hinging on El Shad

[1:21:34] body change is hinging on this
[1:21:38] message come on somebody you getting out
[1:21:41] of the message you're in is hinging on

[1:22:12] message both Old and New Testament the
[1:22:17] message had the ability to put us in
[1:22:21] position

[1:23:36] Nightingale was hanging on
[1:23:37] It come on somebody Congressman Upshaw
[1:23:41] was hanging on it Georgie Carter was
[1:23:43] hanging on it hanging on that word even
[1:23:46] your Prophet had a vision that he was
[1:23:49] going to have a son and he was going to
[1:23:51] call his name
[1:23:52] Joseph and this one came and that one
[1:23:55] came and people mocked him they made fun
[1:23:58] of him said maybe the Lord meant you
[1:24:00] call him Josephine he said no but God
[1:24:02] gave me a promise that he call his son
[1:24:05] his name's
[1:24:07] Joseph what was it William Brandon
[1:24:09] wasn't hanging on his emotion William
[1:24:11] Bram wasn't hanging upon his
[1:24:14] thoughts he was hanging on thus saith
[1:24:16] the Lord let me tell you something if
[1:24:18] you're going to hang your soul on
[1:24:20] something hang it on thus sayith the
[1:24:22] Lord
[1:24:33] notice he goes to Genesis
[1:24:40] 18 he goes to Genesis
[1:24:44] 18 and he steps into a
[1:24:49] position his whole life is built on this
[1:24:52] message his whole life is hanging on the
[1:24:54] word his whole life is hanging on it
[1:24:57] he's waiting for these moments and all
[1:24:59] of a sudden hello him becomes
[1:25:04] flesh he becomes
[1:25:07] flesh he starts walking down a dusty
[1:25:10] road he starts picking up some elements
[1:25:13] he starts picking up some elements and
[1:25:15] he picks up potash and picks up calcium
[1:25:17] he picks up this and he picks up that
[1:25:19] and all of a sudden it blows himself
[1:25:22] abide and he steps into it because
[1:25:24] Elohim was wanting to take on flesh
[1:25:27] because he was wanting to go by
[1:25:29] Abraham's house to have some fellowship
[1:25:31] with his prophet he had talked to him
[1:25:34] with voice he had talked to him in
[1:25:36] Vision but now it was time for Elohim to
[1:25:39] fellowship with Abraham and he's sitting
[1:25:42] there and he's having a conversation he
[1:25:43] says I am the almighty God I am the
[1:25:46] almighty God and I'm not going to I'm
[1:25:48] not going to leave you in that condition
[1:25:50] but I'm going to change your name from
[1:25:52] Abram to Abraham and Abraham recognized
[1:25:56] when he put H in his name he wasn't just
[1:25:58] putting an extra letter there he was
[1:26:00] putting Grace he was putting power he
[1:26:03] was putting anointing in his life what
[1:26:06] was it he changed his name from Abram to
[1:26:10] Abraham which means a father of many
[1:26:13] nations Abram in his condition could not
[1:26:16] produce but he wasn't hanging on his own
[1:26:19] self he was hanging on
[1:26:23] Elohim and Elohim is at his tent door
[1:26:26] and he starts having a conversation with
[1:26:29] him and notice what Abraham calls him he
[1:26:33] calls him
[1:26:36] Elohim because he recognized the same
[1:26:38] one that he's been SP speaking to that
[1:26:40] he's been talking to this is him he's in
[1:26:43] flesh he understands and all of a sudden
[1:26:46] he gets busy about work he's got to make
[1:26:49] a sacrifice he's got to make all these
[1:26:50] things ready he's got to get he's got to
[1:26:52] get everything just right because s
[1:26:55] MDC mzc deserves everything that you got
[1:26:58] he deserves the best that you got he
[1:27:00] deserves the best sacrifice that you got
[1:27:02] that's why I don't believe that you
[1:27:04] ought to come to church haphazardly but
[1:27:06] I believe that you ought to get prayed
[1:27:07] up filled up and anointed by the holy
[1:27:10] spirit before you walk in them doors
[1:27:12] back there I believe that you ought to
[1:27:14] offer God a sacrifice of praise and I
[1:27:16] believe it ought to be your best and
[1:27:18] Abraham Abraham is doing his work but
[1:27:22] when Abraham in he's sitting there and
[1:27:25] he says
[1:27:27] Abraham where is thy wife Sarah he does
[1:27:31] not call him Abram he calls him
[1:27:35] Abraham and the prophet catches it under
[1:27:38] the revealing of the Seven
[1:27:41] Seals that he
[1:27:43] recognized this was
[1:27:48] him this was
[1:27:50] him I've called him that I've wored him
[1:27:54] before but I'm not just talking to
[1:27:57] anybody but I'm talking to
[1:28:00] Elohim elohim's talking back to
[1:28:03] me he having a conversation with me that
[1:28:07] everything that I've trusted in I've
[1:28:09] waited for is right here before
[1:28:13] me if I could express this to you that
[1:28:16] in this room is Elohim the self-existing
[1:28:20] one the one that holds a power when
[1:28:23] Satan says you're not enough God says I
[1:28:26] am
[1:28:30] enough
[1:28:32] Jesus
[1:28:36] Hallelujah he called him all
[1:28:42] sufficient he identified his
[1:28:45] characteristics Abraham identified him

[1:28:58] your sustainer has he been your way
[1:29:01] maker has he been your promisee
[1:29:05] keeper Abraham identified him as
[1:29:09] Elohim and Elohim begin to show him the
[1:29:13] very
[1:29:17] signs how I love what the prophet said
[1:29:20] how did a Abraham recognize that
[1:29:26] how did Abraham recognize

[1:29:32] your life you know the journey that
[1:29:34] you've been down Abraham knows the
[1:29:37] journey he said but how did he recognize

[1:29:43] called him Elohim how many knows that
[1:29:45] true Bible readers yes sir Elohim is all
[1:29:48] sufficient one why did he call him
[1:29:52] Elohim because he could do discern the
[1:29:54] thoughts that was in his

[1:30:19] recognize that come on little Brian how
[1:30:22] do we recognize this Messiah sign in

[1:36:39] away from
[1:36:48] Satan
[1:36:52] Hallelujah hey
[1:36:54] you went through some trials you tried
[1:36:57] to do it on your
[1:36:59] own you tried to manifest it in your own
[1:37:03] flesh but I am your
[1:37:06] everything I am your
[1:37:10] all I'm going to read this quote to
[1:37:13] you cuz I don't want you to miss
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:19] it and question
[1:37:21] answers he said it's not outside SE it's
[1:37:24] not this flesh he said see taste feel
[1:37:26] smelling here it isn't it's subject to
[1:37:29] death and will die but the inside part
[1:37:31] of you down in here inside of that that
[1:37:34] is a person that cannot
[1:37:37] die and the person that the New Life
[1:37:40] Starts from and from this new birth and
[1:37:44] it builds another person in the image of
[1:37:46] this person you are around that life so
[1:37:51] potentially it's in here and what is it
[1:37:54] the word promised before the foundation
[1:37:57] of the world and around there this only
[1:38:00] reflects the
[1:38:02] negative this only reflects the negative
[1:38:06] that will reflect the positive the word
[1:38:10] and the same thing is the translation of
[1:38:12] the Bride will be the same thing that
[1:38:15] word that's in you the body will
[1:38:19] materialize around that word as the same
[1:38:22] thing that it did by Sarah when that old
[1:38:25] body that she had the first body it had
[1:38:27] to be changed in order to produce a son
[1:38:30] but the body cannot do it so it'll have
[1:38:32] to be
[1:38:34] changed to the same to receive the
[1:38:37] Sun Ain't no wonder the Bride of Jesus
[1:38:40] Christ stays in hunger ain't no wonder
[1:38:42] she stays thirsty it's because she's
[1:38:45] feeding on the unfailing body
[1:38:49] word that word that's in you your body
[1:38:53] will materialize around
[1:38:59] it now I dropped that in seed
[1:39:02] form but we're going to watch it in
[1:39:06] materialization what am I saying to you
[1:39:09] I'm saying that literally by the
[1:39:10] preaching of the word that you begin to
[1:39:12] put your body in position for a body
[1:39:14] change just like a little seed as it
