[18:09] [Music]
[18:19] When Jesus

[18:24] for
[18:26] redemption, paying the price for our

[24:56] Want to be remembering sister Donna Ber
[24:58] who's fighting cancer, sister Deborah's
[25:01] friend also, Alina
[25:04] Kesler. Want to be remembering brother
[25:06] Ron, brother Andrew there at the
[25:08] meetings and let the Lord be with them
[25:10] when their travels coming back home.
[25:13] Want to remember little sister Ella
[25:14] Mlard this morning. She's not feeling
[25:16] well. She's sick. Want to remember
[25:19] sister Sue Lambert where she's hurt her

[25:25] Morris, the elderly in the church, and
[25:28] our precious brother Roger and sister
[25:30] Anne
[25:30] Sailors. Want to continue to lift up
[25:33] brother Bill Delaney for the healing and
[25:35] strength in his
[25:39] body. We have Julie
[25:41] Lee. It's brother Ray McBride's daughter
[25:45] going in for a procedure. needs prayer
[25:48] also and pray
[25:50] for salvation for her
[25:53] soul. A call still needs prayers for my
[25:58] grandson Kase. Some want to remember
[26:00] brother Ray's grandson
[26:02] Kase. Maybe you have a need on your
[26:05] heart there, a loved one you've been
[26:07] praying for. You want to lift your hand
[26:08] to the Lord this morning. Maybe brother
[26:11] Chris Morris would come lead us in
[26:13] prayer here this morning.
[26:15] [Music]
[26:26] Amen. Let's all pray and believe
[26:29] together. Our gracious Father, as we
[26:31] just come to you, Lord
[26:33] Jesus, and Father, what a what a great
[26:36] day this is to a believer. And Father,
[26:39] the resurrection, Lord, proved it all.
[26:42] Father, it proved Lord that death can't
[26:46] hold us to a believer.
[26:49] Lord, we can take an anchor cuz we serve
[26:52] a God who knows the very end from the
[26:55] beginning. And Lord, as our brother
[26:58] William so beautifully typed it last
[27:01] night. And Lord, just in my mind was
[27:03] just thinking about them stripes that
[27:05] you was
[27:06] born, the
[27:08] whip. And Lord, there are some prayer
[27:11] requests. There are some children,
[27:13] Father, who's taken
[27:15] claim on every single stripe that you
[27:18] bore. And Father, there's some that's
[27:21] went by the way of the
[27:23] grave. And that they got your life in
[27:25] you, Lord, they'll have a
[27:27] resurrection. And I pray, Father, as our
[27:31] bodies, they'll get healed and they'll
[27:33] get sick again. But
[27:35] Lord, if each and every one of us can
[27:38] have the Holy Ghost, the token and we
[27:41] realize, Lord, that if we have your
[27:43] life, death can't hold
[27:46] us. We ask your blessings now upon the
[27:48] service. Bless our pastor, brother Ron.
[27:51] Help him, Father, as just give him
[27:53] strength in his body. He labored for
[27:55] you, Lord. He loves you, Lord. Bless
[27:59] brother Andrew, Father, in the foreign
[28:01] lands, Lord. bless them their day and
[28:05] Lord bless his service in a special way.
[28:07] We pray come by and be with us in Jesus
[28:09] Christ's name.
[28:16] Amen. As we prepare to take up the
[28:19] offerings here this morning, I believe
[28:21] the Morris family has
[28:23] a song for us after them. Sister
[28:27] Abigail's got one and Sister
[28:30] India. After you give, you may be seated
[28:33] this morning.
[29:34] They're coming.
[30:04] May y'all pray for us? This first time
[30:06] we did this as a family and church.
[30:09] [Music]
[30:11] Anyway, somewhere in the
[30:16] distance, one could hear the
[30:22] hammering as they drove the
[30:27] nails in his hands and in his feet.
[30:36] as a crowd gather and saint
[30:42] away with
[30:47] him. But Jesus knew down in his heart
[30:53] that he would live
[30:59] again. He has risen.
[31:05] He has
[31:12] risen is
[31:15] empty
[31:20] now. And all that
[31:25] remains are the great clothes and the
[31:29] blood stains that old.
[31:32] that old tomb is
[31:36] [Music]
[31:40] indeed. As he laid there in the tomb,
[31:46] the soldiers camped
[31:50] around. God was making
[31:55] plans to send his angels down.
[32:03] As they hurried down from
[32:07] heaven, they didn't make a
[32:12] sound. For when the spirit spoke to him,
[32:18] he got up and walked
[32:23] around. He has risen.
[32:29] He has
[32:31] [Music]
[32:40] rising now.
[32:45] And all that
[32:49] remains are the
[32:51] great in the blood stains that all
[32:56] to all to
[33:03] risen. He has risen.
[33:08] [Music]
[33:09] He has
[33:13] risen that
[33:16] old is
[33:19] in now.
[33:24] And all that
[33:28] remains are the
[33:30] great in the blood that
[33:36] all to
[33:38] [Music]
[33:45] [Applause]
[34:35] [Music]
[34:39] The love of
[34:43] God is greater
[34:47] far than tong. tongue or
[34:52] pin can
[34:56] tell. It goes
[35:00] beyond the highest
[35:05] star and reaches
[35:09] to the lowest.
[35:15] The guilty
[35:19] pair bow down with
[35:23] care. God gave his
[35:28] son to
[35:32] win his airing child.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] be
[35:42] reconciled and pardoned
[35:47] from his sin.
[35:52] Oh love of
[35:55] God, how rich and
[36:00] pure, how
[36:05] measureless and
[36:09] strong it shall
[36:14] forever more endure.
[36:20] The saints send
[36:23] a gel
[36:28] song. When
[36:32] hy shall pass
[36:37] away and earthly
[36:42] thrones and kingdoms
[36:47] fall. When men who
[36:51] hear refuse to
[36:56] pray on rocks and
[37:01] hills and mountains
[37:05] call God's love so
[37:10] sure shall still
[37:15] endure so measure
[37:17] [Music]
[37:20] Sure and
[37:25] strong redeeming
[37:29] grace to Adam's
[37:34] race the saints and
[37:37] [Music]
[37:40] gra
[37:43] song could we with ease
[37:48] Week the ocean
[37:53] filled. And were the
[37:58] skies of parchment made?
[38:03] For every
[38:07] stalk on earth a
[38:12] quill and every
[38:17] man a scrap I
[38:21] trade to write the
[38:26] love of God
[38:31] above would drain the
[38:35] [Music]
[38:36] old shine
[38:40] dry. Nor could the
[38:45] scroll contain the
[38:50] whole though stretched from
[38:55] sky to sky.
[39:00] Oh love of
[39:04] God, how rich and
[39:09] pure, how
[39:14] measureless and
[39:18] strong it shall
[39:24] forever more endure.
[39:29] The saints and
[39:33] day just
[39:38] song. Oh, and
[39:41] I will praise
[39:44] him.
[39:46] I will praise him.
[39:51] Praise the lamb for sinners
[39:58] slain and
[40:00] give him glory all ye
[40:07] people for his blood has washed
[40:11] away each stain.
[40:14] [Music]
[40:22] [Applause]
[40:45] [Music]
[41:03] This ain't a song about chains cuz my
[41:07] chains are gone.
[41:11] [Music]
[41:14] This ain't a song about the past cuz I'm
[41:18] moving
[41:22] on. No more songs about guilty with
[41:27] words like regret. Every mey sounding
[41:33] like mercy
[41:35] instead. This ain't a song about chains.
[41:40] No, my chains are gone.
[41:44] I found my freedom in
[41:47] [Music]
[41:49] you. I found a joy I can't
[41:54] lose. And I thank God it's true. You
[41:58] wrapped your arms around me. And heaven
[42:02] hold from the moment you found me. I
[42:07] found my feet on you.
[42:16] I want to sing about a
[42:19] sing and the price that was
[42:27] paid. I want to sing about the
[42:30] blood that wash my sins away.
[42:38] No more songs about broken with words
[42:43] like defeat. Every mey
[42:47] sounded. I found my freedom in
[42:53] you. I found a joy I can't
[42:58] lose. And I thank God it's true. Wrapped
[43:03] your arms around me and heaven broke.
[43:08] From the moment you found me, I found my
[43:14] freedom in
[43:15] [Music]
[43:21] you. Found my new name. Found that good
[43:27] grace. Found that healing. When the
[43:30] tears fell down my face when I found my
[43:36] beginning, has no
[43:39] ending. Found that second
[43:42] chance, found my best friend, found my
[43:48] forgiveness, found my
[43:51] happiness. And I've been singing ever
[43:54] since. I found my freedom in you.
[43:59] [Music]
[44:01] I found a joy I can't
[44:05] lose. And I thank God it's you wrapped
[44:10] your arms around me. And heaven broke
[44:15] me. From the moment you found me, I
[44:20] found my freedom
[44:27] in the moment you found me. Lord, I
[44:32] found my freom in you.
[44:47] Amen. Have you found your freedom in him
[44:50] tonight, this morning?
[44:53] Amen. Amen. That same holy God brother
[44:56] William spoke about last night where you
[44:59] couldn't touch that mountain. Even if an
[45:00] animal was to touch that mountain, it
[45:02] would take its life. But because of the
[45:04] blood on that mercy seat, we can access
[45:06] him today. We can touch him today.
[45:09] That's how our lives get changed. How we
[45:11] go from one creature to the next because
[45:13] his life comes in us with the Holy
[45:15] Ghost. I urge you this morning, cry out
[45:18] to him here before that word comes
[45:20] forth. This is our
[45:22] opportunity. Jesus, thou son of David,
[45:25] have mercy on me. Have mercy on me.
[45:30] Let us stand as we prepare to turn to
[45:32] the word this
[45:34] morning. Above all
[45:39] powers. Above all
[45:44] powers. Above all
[45:48] kings. Above all
[45:51] nature and all created things.
[45:59] above all
[46:01] wisdom and all the ways of man.
[46:10] You were here before the world
[46:17] be above
[46:22] all of
[46:25] [Music]
[46:27] the above
[46:31] all the world
[46:34] [Music]
[46:41] all and treasures of the earth.
[46:50] There's no way to
[46:53] measure
[46:57] [Music]
[46:59] your
[47:01] [Music]
[47:04] crucify leave behind the stone.
[47:09] You
[47:11] leave me
[47:13] die
[47:16] rejected
[47:17] alone my
[47:22] role on the ground.
[47:28] You
[47:29] [Music]
[47:32] turn and follow
[47:35] [Music]
[47:43] me of all power.
[47:46] [Music]
[47:54] All
[47:56] nature and all
[48:04] creation is
[48:07] done and all the
[48:17] way before the world begin.
[48:22] [Music]
[48:35] All
[48:37] wonder this world has
[48:40] [Music]
[48:47] ever and treasures of the
[48:57] There's no way to make
[49:01] [Music]
[49:03] you come on.
[49:05] You were
[49:11] crucified behind the
[49:15] [Music]
[49:25] sto like a
[49:29] road treble.
[49:38] [Music]
[49:41] Oh
[49:47] me
[49:48] [Music]
[49:50] crucified. Oh you were crucified.
[49:58] Leave behind the
[50:05] [Music]
[50:21] stor. You took
[50:26] control and thought.
[50:32] [Music]
[50:38] Amen. Aren't you so thankful for that
[50:40] this morning that he thought about each
[50:42] and every one of us, step aside, and
[50:45] just took our place.
[50:47] Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[50:49] Lord this morning, isn't it? Amen. Amen.
[50:52] Won't you just turn and greet your
[50:53] neighbor? My I tell you what a what a
[50:56] privilege it is just to see each and
[50:58] every one of you this morning. It's
[51:00] Easter. The sun is risen. He's
[51:06] alive. Ah, it's so so good to see each
[51:09] and every one of you. All of you in your
[51:10] Easter outfits. And I love this time of
[51:14] year. Spring life. Come on. Life's
[51:17] coming. Amen. Life's here because the
[51:19] sun's risen. Amen. Thank you, musicians.
[51:22] I appreciate it this morning. Amen. So
[51:26] good to be here, isn't it? Amen. This
[51:29] morning
[51:30] uh I'd like to speak on uh Freedom
[51:34] Awaits. And uh thank Miss India for
[51:37] singing that song for me this morning. I
[51:40] tell you, she got all the gift of
[51:42] singing straight from me. I used to sing
[51:44] like that.
[51:48] years and years ago, but nope. She took
[51:51] it all.
[51:54] Amen. So, aren't you glad that you can
[51:57] find your freedom in him?
[52:00] In him. He has the power to break every
[52:02] chain That's right. that's ever held you
[52:05] bound. So, like I said, I'd like to turn
[52:07] with to Galatians 5 this morning, verse
[52:11] one.
[52:16] As you're turning there in your
[52:17] scriptures, I want to thank all of our
[52:19] visitors for being with us today. Each
[52:21] and every one of you. Glad to have uh
[52:23] Sister Debbie Morgan with us this
[52:25] morning. I told them in the back, I
[52:27] don't know if uh she comes to hear me
[52:29] speak every Easter or come to Straighten
[52:31] Out alley.
[52:32] So, probably more that than hearing me
[52:35] speak. So, thank you for being here. I
[52:38] want to continue to pray for brother
[52:40] Andrew and them and dad and them as
[52:41] they'll be traveling back this week. I
[52:44] believe they as he told me last night,
[52:46] he said, "We leave Thursday, come back
[52:47] into Wednesday." So, my like that one
[52:51] guy said, "I just don't want to get on
[52:52] the plane. I'm just going to watch it
[52:53] take off." Amen.
[52:56] So, so you pray for them that all that
[52:59] jet lag that would come with all of that
[53:02] and and uh just restore their bodies and
[53:04] that they've given unto the Lord there
[53:06] this weekend. And we've heard of
[53:09] supernatural things that are going on
[53:10] there. And we're expecting great things
[53:13] here this morning, aren't we? Amen.
[53:16] Galatians 5:1 it says, "Stand fast,
[53:19] therefore in the liberty wherewith
[53:21] Christ hath made us free, and be not
[53:25] entangled again with the yoke of
[53:28] bondage." Now, standing fast, we're not
[53:31] just getting free. We're staying free
[53:36] and not returning to a spiritual slavery
[53:40] this morning. I'd like to then also turn
[53:42] to John 8 and verse 31 and 32 this
[53:49] morning. John 8:31 says, "And then said
[53:53] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[53:56] him, if you continue in my word, that's
[54:00] it. Then are ye my disciples indeed."
[54:03] That's right. And ye shall know the
[54:05] truth, and the truth shall make you
[54:09] free. Amen.
[54:11] Glad we have the truth here with us this
[54:12] morning. Amen. Let's just bow our heads
[54:15] as we go to
[54:16] him. Our dear most heavenly father,
[54:19] Lord, we thank you for this opportunity
[54:22] this morning to just speak to the bride
[54:24] of Christ. Now, I ask you Lord that
[54:27] you'll just help me to just step aside
[54:29] this morning. Lord, open up our hearts,
[54:32] our souls. Lord, let us just be hungry
[54:35] for the word this morning. Lord, let us
[54:38] not just be mere listeners, but Lord,
[54:40] let us be doers in it, Lord. This
[54:42] morning, I ask you that you'll just let
[54:44] but just to fall on good seed this
[54:46] morning. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[54:50] Amen. Amen. You can have your seats this
[54:54] morning. So, as I said, I'd like to take
[54:56] the thought this morning on freedom
[54:59] awaits. And I'd like to base our uh
[55:02] sermon this morning around Luke 4 and14.
[55:11] Luke 4:14 it said Jesus returned in
[55:14] power of the spirit unto Galilee. And
[55:18] there went out fame of him through all
[55:21] the region
[55:23] roundabout. And he taught in their
[55:25] synagogues being all being glorified to
[55:28] of
[55:29] all. And he came to Nazareth where he'd
[55:33] been brought up. And as it was custom,
[55:35] he went out into the synagogue on the
[55:37] Sabbath day, and he stood up for to
[55:40] read. And there was delivered unto him
[55:43] the book of the prophet
[55:46] Isaiah. And he opened the book, and he
[55:48] found the place where it is written. And
[55:51] he said, "The spirit of the Lord is upon
[55:54] me, because he hath anointed me to
[55:57] preach the gospel to the poor. He hath
[56:00] sent me to heal the
[56:02] brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to
[56:05] the
[56:06] captives, and recovering of the sight to
[56:09] the blind. Amen. And to set liberty them
[56:13] that are bruised, and to preach the
[56:16] acceptable year of the Lord. Amen. And
[56:19] he closed the book, and he gave it again
[56:22] to the minister that sat down. and the
[56:25] eyes of all of them that were on him on
[56:27] the synagogue that were fastened on him.
[56:29] I could just imagine what it felt like
[56:32] that day. Amen.
[56:35] All eyes on him, all fastened, everyone
[56:39] attentive and
[56:40] ready. And then he says, "This day,
[56:45] this scripture is fulfilled in your
[56:48] ears."
[56:50] This day, this scripture is fulfilled in
[56:53] your ears. Let me just tell you, I'm
[56:56] going to speak to the younger generation
[56:58] here right now. That's the greatest mic
[57:00] drop in history. Come on. He done closed
[57:04] the book. He said, "This day, this
[57:07] scripture is fulfilled in your ears."
[57:11] See, through all of the ages all the way
[57:14] down through, there spoke of this
[57:17] prophet. Through the prophets, they're
[57:19] spoke of him coming. I can just think of
[57:21] it in revelations and five
[57:25] and one and let's just go to
[57:28] there instead
[57:31] of John said I saw on the right hand of
[57:34] him that sat on the throne a book
[57:35] written therein on the backside sealed
[57:38] with seven seals and I strong and I saw
[57:40] a strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[57:43] voice who is worthy to open the book who
[57:47] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[57:49] the seals of thereof. And no man in
[57:52] heaven, nor in earth, neither under the
[57:54] earth, was able to open the book,
[57:56] neither to look
[57:57] thereon. And
[57:59] John wept much, because no man was found
[58:04] worthy to open to read the book, neither
[58:07] to look
[58:08] thereon. And one of the elders saith
[58:10] unto him, weep not, John.
[58:13] Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[58:16] the root of David, hath prevailed. Thank
[58:18] you, Lord. and open the book, and to
[58:20] loose the seven seals thereof. And
[58:23] behold, and lo, in the midst of the
[58:26] throne of the four beasts, and the midst
[58:28] of the elders stood a lamb as it had
[58:32] been slain, having seven thorn, seven
[58:34] horns, and seven eyes, which are the
[58:37] seven spirits of God, sent forth into
[58:40] all the earth. See, John looked when it
[58:43] said, "A l a lion hath prevailed." But
[58:47] he didn't see a lion. He saw a lamb that
[58:49] was slain at the foundation of the
[58:51] earth. Amen. See in the book of Genesis
[58:54] when Adam and Eve when God spoke to them
[58:57] and said, "Adam, Adam, where art thou,
[58:59] Adam?" And he come in the midst of the
[59:02] garden and they knew that he he seen
[59:05] them. But see, he made a way for them.
[59:08] Thank you, Lord. He said, "I'll put
[59:09] enmity between thy seed and my seed." He
[59:12] said, "I'll make a way for you." And he
[59:14] pulled out two coats of skins. Yes, sir.
[59:16] What was he showing us there? That there
[59:18] is going to be a lamb, a lamb slain from
[59:21] the foundation of the world. I love this
[59:24] story that brother Brandham says on
[59:25] Arnold von Winkler over in Switzerland.
[59:28] That great that great war that had
[59:30] happened there many years
[59:32] ago. And Arnold and all the Swiss army
[59:35] was backed into a corner. The German had
[59:37] come in and they had them there. And
[59:40] Arnold said,
[59:43] "Brethren,
[59:44] friends, today I will lay it all on the
[59:48] line. Today I will lay my life on the
[59:51] line." Right? Why? He had a wife. He had
[59:55] children down over the hill. Amen. And
[59:57] they said, "What will you do, Arnold?"
[59:59] He said, "Today I will give my life for
[1:00:02] my country." And as he said that, he ran
[1:00:06] down off that hill. He said, "Make way
[1:00:08] for liberty. Come on. Come on. And he
[1:00:11] took and he plunged spears into his
[1:00:13] bosom as many as he could. And it
[1:00:15] quickened each and every one of those
[1:00:17] men that stood there that day. And they
[1:00:19] did the same as they went down through
[1:00:22] there. Each of them plunging spears into
[1:00:24] their bosoms, taking on all of them. And
[1:00:28] what did it do? They went running. Every
[1:00:32] single one of them. And still to this
[1:00:34] day, there has not been a war there in
[1:00:36] Switzerland. And Jesus would
[1:00:40] say, excuse me, brother Brandon would
[1:00:42] say, said, "I can see it." Said, "Adam's
[1:00:46] race backed into a corner
[1:00:49] and all the angels and every one of them
[1:00:51] standing there
[1:00:53] saying, "What will we do?" And I could
[1:00:56] see
[1:00:57] him one step forth. He said, "I will go.
[1:01:02] I will go for race, for Adam's race, and
[1:01:06] I will take the spears, and I will
[1:01:09] plunge them into my bosom. Why? He was
[1:01:12] speaking out, making way for liberty for
[1:01:15] each and every one of us, freedom for
[1:01:17] each and every one of us today. Amen.
[1:01:20] And he has just stepped forth. Oh, what
[1:01:23] will you do? But God made a way for him.
[1:01:27] Through the foundation of the world, God
[1:01:30] made a
[1:01:31] way. Brother Brandham would say it like
[1:01:34] this. In Christ, the mystery of God
[1:01:36] revealed. Now notice down through the
[1:01:38] ages, he has been gradually letting this
[1:01:41] out. That's right.
[1:01:44] Slowly unfail unfolding the mystery
[1:01:47] through the prophets, through types.
[1:01:51] And now we can just go on that. and he
[1:01:54] was expressing
[1:01:55] himself. And we go on down a little
[1:01:58] further and it says, "All those things
[1:02:00] typed
[1:02:01] him just in type, but yet mystery was
[1:02:04] hidden." See, it was hidden all through
[1:02:06] the ages. Satan thought that he would
[1:02:10] have him at every turn. That's right.
[1:02:12] But he was hid all through the ages.
[1:02:14] Right?
[1:02:15] Them men don't know what they were
[1:02:17] doing. They only knew that they were led
[1:02:20] by the spirit to do something. Now
[1:02:23] holding it back in the last days for
[1:02:27] that great
[1:02:28] revelation, but expressing it,
[1:02:31] expressing him in Moses,
[1:02:34] in David and Joseph and Elijah and on
[1:02:38] down through. And we can take each and
[1:02:40] every one of those prophets and bring
[1:02:42] their lives and show it and express
[1:02:45] Jesus Christ perfectly. Exactly. Yes.
[1:02:50] Yet never giving his secret in full.
[1:02:54] Aren't you thankful for that this
[1:02:56] morning? Amen. Each and every one of
[1:02:58] them was typing what he would be. That's
[1:03:00] it. But it would never give his secret
[1:03:02] in full.
[1:03:07] Wait for it to make known in those last
[1:03:11] days as he had promised. Waiting for it
[1:03:14] to be fully comprehended. see before he
[1:03:17] could express
[1:03:19] it, before he could do the whole
[1:03:22] thing. Don't you just like that this
[1:03:24] morning? As we look back all through the
[1:03:27] ages, we can just see him as he was
[1:03:29] typing each and every one of it, every
[1:03:32] single time all along the
[1:03:34] way as Abraham would take Isaac. That's
[1:03:38] right. And he would just take him and he
[1:03:41] would go to that mountain to sacrifice
[1:03:43] Isaac. Except God said, "I've given to
[1:03:46] you. Now give them back to me." Right?
[1:03:49] So he had to trust in God. What he was
[1:03:51] doing, the fulfillment of all of his
[1:03:53] plan down through the ages. Right. Amen.
[1:03:56] And Abraham would turn to the servant
[1:03:58] said, "I am the lad. We shall return."
[1:04:00] That's right. Amen. I am the lad shall.
[1:04:04] See, he had a promise. That's right.
[1:04:06] Isaac had been promised to him. That's
[1:04:08] right. And he had held fast to that
[1:04:10] promise. But this day, he was giving
[1:04:13] Isaac back to God.
[1:04:16] And God said, "I'm going to see what
[1:04:17] it'll do." And he laid that wood upon
[1:04:20] Isaac's back. It was a type of what was
[1:04:23] to come. And they would go up that hill.
[1:04:26] They would go up there to sacrifice
[1:04:28] Isaac upon the altar. And as Abraham
[1:04:32] would get ready to plunge that knife
[1:04:34] into Isaac's chest, laid there bound on
[1:04:36] the altar, behold, a lamb in the bushes.
[1:04:40] Thank you, Lord. Amen. An angel steadied
[1:04:43] Abraham's hand. Amen. He said,"Abraham,
[1:04:47] I know you trust me." Come on, buddy.
[1:04:50] See, that was just a type. But there was
[1:04:53] one that was going to come down through
[1:04:54] the ages, and God was going to put him
[1:04:57] all the way through
[1:04:59] for each and every one of us.
[1:05:02] And as Jesus was reading
[1:05:05] this, the anointing was upon him. said
[1:05:09] the anointing was upon is upon
[1:05:12] me. I can just see
[1:05:15] it there in Matthew as as he come to to
[1:05:20] be baptized of John and John standing
[1:05:23] there and all the Pharisees have come
[1:05:25] out and he called them, "Oh, you
[1:05:26] generation of vipers.
[1:05:29] You generation of vipers." And here come
[1:05:32] Jesus down to Jordan to be baptized.
[1:05:36] And John said, "There's going to come
[1:05:38] one that I ain't even worthy to loose
[1:05:41] the shoes thereof." That's right. And
[1:05:43] here he come. Here he come to be
[1:05:45] baptized of John. John said, "No, no, I
[1:05:49] have need to be baptized of thee." Not
[1:05:52] yet. Not yet, John. Not yet.
[1:05:57] And as John baptized
[1:06:00] him, the spirit of God fell upon Jesus.
[1:06:06] And the spirit of God descending like a
[1:06:08] dove lightened upon him and a voice from
[1:06:12] heaven saying, "This is my beloved son
[1:06:16] in whom I'm well
[1:06:19] pleased." See, Jesus had been anointed
[1:06:22] at that point, at that moment. And now
[1:06:26] he's about to fulfill all these things
[1:06:29] that all the prophets down through the
[1:06:31] ages had expressed him in. every single
[1:06:34] one of
[1:06:35] them hidden through the
[1:06:38] ages. That anointing that was upon him
[1:06:40] in that day to do great things, right?
[1:06:45] Talking about anointing and pulling out
[1:06:48] anointing from Christ. I love the story
[1:06:50] of that woman that had the blood issue.
[1:06:52] That's right. That blood issue for 12
[1:06:55] years in
[1:06:57] Luke. And as he would come down through
[1:07:00] there, the crowd was just so great. Each
[1:07:02] and every one of those persons just
[1:07:04] touching Jesus. They wanted to touch
[1:07:07] Jesus. That's right. I would have I I
[1:07:10] would have. All that I've heard of
[1:07:13] Jesus. I I I just want just to touch
[1:07:16] him. That's right. But see, there was
[1:07:18] one that had faith so great. That's
[1:07:21] right, sir. That said, if I can just
[1:07:23] touch the hem of his garment, if I can
[1:07:27] just just get just a little touch of
[1:07:30] him, that anointing that was on him that
[1:07:33] day, I know I can be healed.
[1:07:38] And as Jesus would walk through there,
[1:07:41] he would say, "Oh, somebody touched me."
[1:07:44] Amen. I felt virtue leave my body. I
[1:07:47] felt a little anointing that was pulled
[1:07:50] out from somebody. Somebody in the crowd
[1:07:54] was crying for something. They was
[1:07:56] crying for something just a little bit
[1:07:58] more than just to just to touch me. They
[1:08:01] needed something within.
[1:08:04] Oh, that type that blood issue, Lord. As
[1:08:08] he would be touched just to
[1:08:10] him and he would just turn. Now the
[1:08:14] crowd they're asking well who who did we
[1:08:17] all we've all touched and the disciples
[1:08:20] they were baffled they said
[1:08:21] Lord many has touched you today many no
[1:08:26] one touched me and he would turn and
[1:08:28] there she was trembling
[1:08:33] scared what would Jesus
[1:08:35] do maybe I should not have done what
[1:08:40] No he said damsel
[1:08:43] Oh my sweetheart,
[1:08:47] thy faith,
[1:08:49] thy faith has made thee whole.
[1:08:52] That anointing that was so great that he
[1:08:54] would open those books and he would
[1:08:57] read, that anointing that was fallen
[1:08:59] upon him, that anointing that we pull
[1:09:02] out of him, right? Amen. We shall see
[1:09:05] miracles. Not just a song, but a
[1:09:08] presence that's felt. We're pulling out
[1:09:11] of him what we need this morning. That's
[1:09:13] right. Just reach out and touch him. The
[1:09:17] anointing is here. He's never left.
[1:09:20] That's right. The crowd may be great.
[1:09:23] They might want to touch him, but little
[1:09:25] bride, you have a faith like no other.
[1:09:29] That you can pull out your healing this
[1:09:31] morning. That's right. You can pull out
[1:09:34] what you have need of this morning.
[1:09:38] He said,
[1:09:40] "Because I have come to give freedom to
[1:09:43] those that are bound, to preach to the
[1:09:46] poor the gospel. He has sent me to heal
[1:09:49] up the brokenhearted, preach deliverance
[1:09:52] to the
[1:09:54] captives, recovering of the sight to the
[1:09:56] blind, liberty to them that are
[1:10:00] bruised." I love all of that. Each each
[1:10:04] one of them, the poor, the
[1:10:06] brokenhearted, the captives, the blind,
[1:10:10] the bruised, the
[1:10:12] oppressed. Poor not just lacking in
[1:10:15] poverty,
[1:10:17] but empty inside.
[1:10:20] Come on. He He didn't just come just to
[1:10:23] just talk to the poor because he would
[1:10:25] also say, "The poor you have always."
[1:10:27] That's right. Amen. But me, not always.
[1:10:29] That's right. That's right. But the poor
[1:10:32] inside. That's who he come to. Come on.
[1:10:36] The poor spiritually. He came to preach
[1:10:38] good news to the poor. The
[1:10:41] brokenhearted. The ones that had been c
[1:10:43] crushed by losses, betrayed
[1:10:46] or failure. The brokenhearted, he came
[1:10:49] to heal them.
[1:10:52] Captives, those that were spiritually
[1:10:54] and emotionally in prison, he came to
[1:10:56] unlock that sale. Come on. The blind
[1:11:01] physically he healed many. That's right.
[1:11:04] Putting mud in their eyes. But the
[1:11:07] greatest one is spiritually. That's
[1:11:10] right. Spiritually opening their eyes. I
[1:11:14] loved how brother William would preach
[1:11:15] it last night of those cherapons
[1:11:17] standing guard there as those flaming
[1:11:20] swords. Lord, to just block the way to
[1:11:24] blind off what they would see. But see,
[1:11:26] there was one that was given a light
[1:11:29] that was showing it all the way back.
[1:11:32] Yes, sir. All the way back to that mercy
[1:11:34] seed. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:11:38] oppressed, those carrying wounds of
[1:11:41] life's battles, right?
[1:11:44] Many of us here, come on. We have scars
[1:11:47] that are deep. That's right. Many things
[1:11:50] that we carry a weight that we can't
[1:11:54] explain. Right. But he came to do all of
[1:11:58] this. See, I was a captive. I have been
[1:12:02] bound. Come on. I have been poor in my
[1:12:05] spirit. I have been blind in my
[1:12:07] spiritual looking. I have been oppressed
[1:12:10] by the world. But he came to broke each
[1:12:13] and every one of them things.
[1:12:16] Don't you just love him this morning?
[1:12:20] There's a story that is amongst us of of
[1:12:23] a man in our midst, a strong
[1:12:25] man, and they would come to him, brother
[1:12:29] Metis, and they would say, "Brother
[1:12:31] Metis, we have a
[1:12:34] test. There's a jail cell, and if
[1:12:38] there's anyone that can break out of
[1:12:40] this cell, it would be
[1:12:43] you." He was a strong man. He's still a
[1:12:45] strong man. Probably just as strong as
[1:12:47] me today. and he's back there and he's
[1:12:49] like, "Not me, brother." But he he's a
[1:12:52] still a strong
[1:12:54] man. And they would give him a
[1:12:56] sledgehammer and they said, "Now, now
[1:12:58] we're going to give this to you now. We
[1:12:59] want you to try to break out if you can.
[1:13:02] Now, if you
[1:13:03] can, of course, brother Metis, he did
[1:13:06] exactly what they wanted him to. He put
[1:13:08] it to the
[1:13:09] test." It didn't
[1:13:12] work. Broke right out of that jail cell.
[1:13:17] But you see, there's been many through
[1:13:20] life's ages that they were in prison.
[1:13:23] They were trapped. Come on now.
[1:13:26] And the devil said, "I I think you could
[1:13:28] break." But they couldn't break out of
[1:13:30] it. Amen. Not on their own will.
[1:13:34] Now, I'm not talking about breaking out
[1:13:35] of natural jail cells this morning, but
[1:13:38] I'm talking about breaking out of
[1:13:39] spiritual jail cells. And each and every
[1:13:42] one of us could never do it on our own.
[1:13:46] That's right. None of us could step into
[1:13:47] a jail cell of what the Satan has put
[1:13:50] upon us and we could just take a
[1:13:52] sledgehammer and just do it ourselves.
[1:13:55] We could never break out. That's right.
[1:13:57] We were bound. That's right. And that's
[1:14:00] the worst thing I see about young men
[1:14:02] and women today. They stay bound. Come
[1:14:05] on. They stay locked up. You know, I I
[1:14:09] was a I was a police officer and I put
[1:14:13] several people in prison and
[1:14:16] uh there was a gentleman one day that
[1:14:19] had uh he messed up pretty bad bad and
[1:14:22] uh we got a call and a woman had been
[1:14:25] able to escape this man and and she's
[1:14:29] she was abused by him and and she was
[1:14:32] strangled by him and he had kept her
[1:14:34] locked up and and so she was able to get
[1:14:38] free and use somebody's phone. They
[1:14:39] called and so we went and we, you know,
[1:14:41] helped her out and we went to the
[1:14:44] house to check his side of the story as
[1:14:47] well. And he come out like any other
[1:14:51] day. And he said, "What she said, I
[1:14:56] did, you know, thank the Lord for
[1:14:58] cameras." He told it all. He told the
[1:15:02] whole thing. Yeah. I wouldn't let her
[1:15:05] leave and I choked her and I beat her.
[1:15:07] You know, I just, you know, I made a
[1:15:09] mistake. And I said, "Well, thank you. I
[1:15:11] appreciate you being honest with me. It
[1:15:14] just makes it a whole lot easier all the
[1:15:15] way
[1:15:17] around.
[1:15:19] Reports, warrants, all of that.
[1:15:23] So, we get to the prison there at uh
[1:15:25] Hutchinson Inn there in Rockingham
[1:15:27] County and and he said, "Uh, so how long
[1:15:31] do you think I'll be
[1:15:33] here?" You know, I I don't know. That's
[1:15:37] not left up to me. He said, "Well, do
[1:15:40] you think I'll be able to make a phone
[1:15:41] call and call my boss and tell him I'll
[1:15:43] be a little late to work today?"
[1:15:46] I said, "You know, let's take care of
[1:15:48] some other paperwork. We'll see the
[1:15:50] magistrate and then you may get that
[1:15:51] phone call. You you may be able to Okay.
[1:15:55] Yeah. Thank you. That'd be great. Yeah.
[1:15:57] I you know, it's a new job and I don't
[1:15:59] want to get fired from it. Just
[1:16:02] like congratulations.
[1:16:05] [Applause]
[1:16:08] you know, he and he went to the
[1:16:10] magistrate and he did like he did to me
[1:16:13] and he told told him the whole
[1:16:16] story and he looked over at the
[1:16:18] magistrate and he said, "Now now I I was
[1:16:20] telling the officer I I'd like to call
[1:16:23] my my boss, tell him I'm going to be a
[1:16:25] little late to work
[1:16:27] and it's kind of a you almost like an
[1:16:30] inside joke, you know, between me and
[1:16:32] the magistrate. It's like he looks at me
[1:16:36] like after what this guy just told
[1:16:39] me. Yeah, he's not going to get out.
[1:16:43] He's going to be really late.
[1:16:47] Like several years late for that
[1:16:51] appointment, right? And and you know, it
[1:16:54] just it just tickled me. You know, he he
[1:16:56] took prison as a joke. He took it on
[1:17:00] lightly. He took all that he had done
[1:17:04] very lightly, very jovy.
[1:17:09] But there was laws that was placed. Come
[1:17:12] on. There was things that he had broken
[1:17:17] and now he's about to pay the price.
[1:17:22] Talking about being bound, he was there
[1:17:24] for several years. He may still be
[1:17:26] there. I'm not sure. It's been a while
[1:17:28] now. I've not been checking on him or
[1:17:30] anything,
[1:17:32] but but many
[1:17:34] times us in our human
[1:17:37] nature naturally and
[1:17:40] spiritually, we kind of break some
[1:17:42] things and we
[1:17:44] go, it wasn't that bad. Yeah. Come on,
[1:17:49] buddy. You know, come on. I know people
[1:17:52] that's that's doing the same thing I'm
[1:17:53] doing. Come on. Uhoh. And it's it's not
[1:17:56] that bad. Then they kind of got away
[1:17:58] with it and they, you know, they didn't
[1:18:00] suffer from any consequences thereof.
[1:18:05] Remember, naturally, and spiritually,
[1:18:08] the greatest is spiritually, right?
[1:18:11] Spiritually, when you sit in church,
[1:18:13] come on. Now, I'm not talking to anybody
[1:18:15] here. I'm just glad that y'all are here
[1:18:16] to listen to me this morning. But when
[1:18:18] you're sitting in church and and and you
[1:18:20] go, "Well, you know, they're getting by
[1:18:22] with it, so I can probably get by with
[1:18:25] you." Come on now. Don't be mistaken.
[1:18:28] Come on. Don't be caught in that cell.
[1:18:31] Don't be caught in that bound thing that
[1:18:33] would hold you back because it's may
[1:18:37] bind you and at worst bind your
[1:18:39] children.
[1:18:41] And then you're starting a locking chain
[1:18:43] down through each and every generation
[1:18:45] that you would have
[1:18:48] of I can get away with it. I got away
[1:18:52] with it. You'll get away with it. And
[1:18:54] you might not even say that,
[1:18:57] but that's the mind thought.
[1:18:59] That's the spiritual battle. Amen.
[1:19:02] Brother Brandon would say the choosing
[1:19:04] place, the battleground in the mind. The
[1:19:08] greatest battle ever fought. Ah, wars
[1:19:11] and spears and bombs, but it's right
[1:19:13] here.
[1:19:15] You don't know what's going on in men
[1:19:16] and women's lives in their mind,
[1:19:20] but Jesus does. Amen. When I talk about
[1:19:23] breaking the captives free, we're
[1:19:26] talking about sin. And what is sin? It's
[1:19:29] unbelief.
[1:19:31] Unbelief. Attributes are drinking,
[1:19:34] smoking, running around, breaking laws,
[1:19:37] natural laws. Unbelief.
[1:19:41] That's sin.
[1:19:43] Sin, shame, guilt, guilt for things
[1:19:47] you've done in the
[1:19:48] past. My I
[1:19:51] I just love the fact that he has come to
[1:19:53] break every single one of those things.
[1:19:56] To set each and every one of you that
[1:19:59] were captive. That's right. That were
[1:20:02] captive. The greatest thing that I can
[1:20:05] say is that you know we we are all
[1:20:08] sinners saved by grace this morning.
[1:20:11] Each and every one of us here accepting
[1:20:14] the blood of Christ. And you know Satan
[1:20:16] would come to you and he would say, "I
[1:20:18] know how you've acted. I know what
[1:20:20] you've did. And he would put guilt on
[1:20:23] you. Guilt for what you have done.
[1:20:26] That's right. But then Jesus comes.
[1:20:29] Hallelujah. Amen. You know, it just
[1:20:32] amazes me how
[1:20:35] free a Christian can be when Jesus fully
[1:20:38] comes in and you give him everything.
[1:20:42] That's right. You say, "God, you know
[1:20:45] every single one of my besetting sins,
[1:20:47] every single thing that I've ever done,
[1:20:49] all through the ages, all through my
[1:20:51] life, all through my parents' life,
[1:20:54] right? Every single one of them, you
[1:20:57] know them." And you give them to God.
[1:21:00] And what does God do?
[1:21:05] That's right. Amen. Clean slate. That's
[1:21:07] right.
[1:21:10] Clean. completely
[1:21:14] clean. And many times Satan will come
[1:21:17] and say, "Now,
[1:21:19] now
[1:21:21] Lord, now that person, they have some
[1:21:24] things that I know about in their life."
[1:21:27] And Jesus pulls up the book and he says,
[1:21:30] "Come on, you're using two different
[1:21:32] books, right? Because I I don't have
[1:21:36] that here." and you're standing
[1:21:39] there and you're like, "Yep, Satan, I
[1:21:43] did do
[1:21:44] that." And God's like, "Yep, not on my
[1:21:48] end." Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:51] And Satan's like, "No, no, no, no, no,
[1:21:53] no. You don't know him like I know him."
[1:21:55] But say, and Jesus says, "I think I
[1:21:59] do. I think I do. I I'm pretty sure
[1:22:04] that the blood I shed on Calvary,
[1:22:09] it wiped it all away.
[1:22:12] The blood that I shed, says Matthew
[1:22:15] Spencer. Thank you, Lord. Yep. That's
[1:22:19] it. Matthew Spencer. Matthew David
[1:22:22] Spencer. Yep. That's it. That's all I
[1:22:24] got on my end.
[1:22:27] He says the same thing about you. About
[1:22:30] you, Luke. He said, "Luke, clean slate."
[1:22:33] Amen. All of us. Brother Doug Bowman,
[1:22:36] Sister Chassity, Brother Chester, each
[1:22:38] and everyone. He'll pull he'll pull out
[1:22:40] your book of life and
[1:22:43] you said the blood
[1:22:45] applied when he shed his blood for me.
[1:22:49] I accepted that.
[1:22:51] All my sins. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:22:54] Lord. All of them
[1:22:56] captive. I was bound. sin, guilt, shame,
[1:23:01] ashamed, ashamed of what I did. That's
[1:23:04] right. But then he came and I say,
[1:23:06] "Lord,
[1:23:08] it's all under you." That's right. He He
[1:23:12] never even sees it. Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:15] Like you've never done it in the first
[1:23:16] place.
[1:23:19] But he wants you to go a little bit
[1:23:20] further. Amen. That's right. Not just to
[1:23:25] get a clean slate and then start all
[1:23:26] over again. That's right. No, it's to
[1:23:30] never return to slavery again.
[1:23:34] Never return to spiritual slavery again.
[1:23:40] Amen.
[1:23:42] This is not a debt collection agency
[1:23:44] where we're going to work out back and
[1:23:46] forth where you get a little bit of debt
[1:23:48] and we'll clean it off the slate and
[1:23:51] then after a while we'll call you back
[1:23:53] and say for a certain percent interest
[1:23:55] your sins can be negotiated. Uhoh.
[1:24:00] Don't go back.
[1:24:02] Don't go back. There's nothing to go
[1:24:04] back to.
[1:24:06] Nothing in this world to go back to.
[1:24:08] Amen. As I raise Titus up and India up,
[1:24:12] they'll hear hear stories about me.
[1:24:16] They'll know things about
[1:24:18] me. But I don't want them to go back to
[1:24:22] that. I'm telling them things for a
[1:24:25] reason and say, "Don't you go back just
[1:24:29] because I may have got away.
[1:24:32] Don't you try." That's right. Don't
[1:24:35] Don't Don't push your luck.
[1:24:38] Amen.
[1:24:40] Don't test it. That's right.
[1:24:44] Brother Brandham says in Israel and the
[1:24:46] church, it says, "The greatest thing
[1:24:48] that I find against the church tonight
[1:24:51] is fear." Everybody is scared to death
[1:24:54] about something. What are you scared
[1:24:56] about? If a man's born again, he should
[1:25:00] be happy, carefree, just like these
[1:25:03] fellas up here that was singing and
[1:25:06] brother testifying in the back there.
[1:25:08] Just free. Ain't nothing that can harm
[1:25:10] you. Nothing present, nothing future,
[1:25:14] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:25:16] God that's in Christ. God has promised.
[1:25:21] But that's what Satan will put on you is
[1:25:24] fear. That's right. Fear. Fear kills
[1:25:28] dreams. Fear kills hopes.
[1:25:33] It fear will put you in the hospital.
[1:25:35] You'll be so tormented in fear of
[1:25:37] things. Dr. Google, you read Dr. Google
[1:25:41] on a symptom or pull something and say,
[1:25:44] "Now I I did this to that shoulder." And
[1:25:47] fear will put you in the hospital. It'll
[1:25:50] give you anxiety.
[1:25:52] And brother Brandham is saying that's
[1:25:55] the greatest thing that I find against
[1:25:57] the church today is fear. Fear.
[1:26:02] That's it. I find it that that fear I've
[1:26:06] said killed streams, but many times fear
[1:26:09] will not even let you start them.
[1:26:13] Fear will put you so bound in your mind,
[1:26:17] right? That you won't even make that
[1:26:19] step. Right. Right. That's right. We're
[1:26:22] in church. This is a building here.
[1:26:25] There's people in it. Preachers will
[1:26:28] come and speak. Sinners will come.
[1:26:31] That's where you come to get saved.
[1:26:35] But fear will take a sinner and they
[1:26:37] will say, "If you make a step,
[1:26:41] they will know you." These are all
[1:26:43] Christian folks here.
[1:26:46] Fear will hold you bound into that not
[1:26:49] even making that initial step to go
[1:26:52] forward in it.
[1:26:54] It'll keep you from your dream of being
[1:26:56] free. That's right. It will hold you
[1:26:59] back.
[1:27:00] Come on. That's the greatest thing that
[1:27:04] I find against the church today. He
[1:27:05] says, "Fear." Yeah. But Jesus says,
[1:27:09] "Fear not." Amen. I have not given you
[1:27:12] the spirit of fear. I have given you the
[1:27:15] spirit of sound mind and hope.
[1:27:18] Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] Amen.
[1:27:22] He didn't give Jesus didn't give that to
[1:27:24] you. Jesus didn't give you the spirit of
[1:27:26] fear. Amen.
[1:27:29] He come to crush it. He come to destroy
[1:27:32] fear.
[1:27:34] There's no promise in fear. None
[1:27:37] whatsoever. Amen. In Deuteronomy
[1:27:40] 31:6, and Moses is speaking to the
[1:27:44] people here, right before he gives them
[1:27:47] to Joshua to take them over into the
[1:27:50] land, and he says, "Be strong and of
[1:27:54] good courage."
[1:27:58] Now, they have been through a whole heap
[1:28:00] of a lot, a ton of things,
[1:28:04] and he's telling them, "Be strong and of
[1:28:07] good
[1:28:07] courage. Fear
[1:28:09] not, nor be afraid of
[1:28:14] them. Be afraid of them." Well, who's
[1:28:17] them? them. Uh things in life, Satan's
[1:28:21] traps, them giants in the land, them
[1:28:26] things that would hold you back, them
[1:28:31] be not afraid of them. For the Lord thy
[1:28:35] God, he it is that doth go with thee. He
[1:28:39] will He will not fail thee. He will not
[1:28:43] forsake thee.
[1:28:46] Amen. I love that promise.
[1:28:52] In my book, that's a promise. Be strong
[1:28:55] and of good courage.
[1:28:59] I'm not talking about being physically
[1:29:00] strong. It's good to have strength about
[1:29:04] you. But what is he speaking of?
[1:29:07] Hey, this is a spiritual walk here.
[1:29:12] Amen. It's a promise. And I'm holding
[1:29:16] fast to a promise. Be strong and of good
[1:29:19] courage.
[1:29:21] Fear not, nor be afraid of
[1:29:24] them. Don't you just love that this
[1:29:27] morning?
[1:29:29] Amen.
[1:29:34] Philippians 3:13 says, "Brethren, I
[1:29:37] count not myself to be
[1:29:40] apprehended. But this one thing I do,
[1:29:43] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:29:46] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:29:49] which are before, I press toward the
[1:29:52] mark of the prize of the high calling,
[1:29:54] God Christ Jesus."
[1:29:57] Paul humbling himself
[1:30:00] here. I have not yet arrived to all of
[1:30:02] it. I count not myself as
[1:30:06] apprehended, but I have fully
[1:30:10] embraced that there is a prize that is
[1:30:12] set before
[1:30:15] me. My
[1:30:17] past is nothing
[1:30:21] because I'm not looking back to my past.
[1:30:25] I am pressing forth
[1:30:28] as a runner presses forth in a race.
[1:30:32] He's not running backwards. He's not on
[1:30:35] a treadmill standing in one place just
[1:30:38] going at it. He's going forward.
[1:30:43] And that's what he's telling us to do in
[1:30:45] these scriptures. Press forward. That's
[1:30:48] right. Press forward to the prize that
[1:30:51] is set before you.
[1:30:54] Don't stop. Stay focused.
[1:30:57] Keep your eyes on the horizon. That's
[1:31:00] right. I love the story of Gideon as
[1:31:02] Gideon and all those men, 32,000 men of
[1:31:06] Israel that would go forth into battle.
[1:31:09] And you know, God spoke to him and said,
[1:31:12] "That's too many men." Because if they
[1:31:15] would have went down with 32,000 men,
[1:31:18] they would have said, "We did it on our
[1:31:20] own." Right. But God said, "You're going
[1:31:23] to limit them." And this is how you're
[1:31:25] going to limit them. Take them down to
[1:31:27] drink. And when they drink, I'm going to
[1:31:31] show you the ones that lap water like a
[1:31:34] dog. But the ones that keep their eyes
[1:31:37] on the horizon. There it is. Amen. What
[1:31:41] he end up with? He just ended up with
[1:31:43] 300 men. That's right.
[1:31:45] 32,000 to 300 men.
[1:31:49] Let me just tell you those other guys
[1:31:52] that got sent home, they probably didn't
[1:31:56] understand one bit. That's right. Not
[1:31:59] one
[1:32:00] bit. But see those
[1:32:02] 300, it's not in numbers. It's not in
[1:32:05] numbers, little bride. That's right.
[1:32:08] It's in keeping your eye on the horizon.
[1:32:11] There it is. On the horizon of what is
[1:32:13] the prize that is set before us. Come
[1:32:15] on. God has a prize. Amen. Come on,
[1:32:18] buddy. God has an end for each and every
[1:32:20] one of us. Keep an eye out for me. When
[1:32:23] you hear those wagon wheels coming down
[1:32:25] the road,
[1:32:28] my little bride. Oh yes. Step on in.
[1:32:31] Amen. Keep your eye on the horizon.
[1:32:34] That's right. Press forward.
[1:32:37] Don't look behind. Never going back.
[1:32:40] Amen. That's good.
[1:32:42] When Jesus talks about that anointing
[1:32:45] that is on him, it breaks I'd like to
[1:32:48] say yolks, not egg yolks. They're too
[1:32:52] valuable
[1:32:54] nowadays. Yolks are back in the olden
[1:32:58] days are are wooden contraptions that
[1:33:00] were put around oxen's head and they
[1:33:03] would have two oaks. One would
[1:33:06] be and then the two oxen, one would be a
[1:33:10] lead oxen and the other would be more of
[1:33:12] a follower. And that yoke that was
[1:33:15] holding them was heavy. It was hard.
[1:33:21] But it was there to hold them in
[1:33:23] restraint to keep them bound together so
[1:33:27] that one's not plowing this way, one's
[1:33:29] not plowing that way, but he's keeping
[1:33:32] you bound.
[1:33:34] in Isaiah 10 and 27. And it shall and it
[1:33:38] shall come to pass in that day that his
[1:33:42] burden shall be taken off from thy
[1:33:45] shoulder. Right?
[1:33:49] Who's your burden?
[1:33:52] Satan's burden. It's going to be taken
[1:33:54] off your shoulders. Come on.
[1:33:56] and his yoke from off thy neck, and the
[1:33:59] yoke shall be destroyed because of the
[1:34:03] anointing. Amen.
[1:34:06] Amen. Yes, sir. I just love it. Isaiah
[1:34:10] is speaking of him, expressing him in
[1:34:14] just a little way here again.
[1:34:18] because of his
[1:34:21] anointing. Your
[1:34:23] yoke may be sin, guilt, like I've said,
[1:34:26] fear and anxiety,
[1:34:29] addiction,
[1:34:32] strongholds, legalism,
[1:34:34] come on. Religious, come on. Religious
[1:34:38] bindings,
[1:34:40] depression, trauma,
[1:34:43] shame. You have a yoke this morning.
[1:34:46] It's time to get rid of it. That's
[1:34:48] right. It it it is time to use the
[1:34:50] anointing to break that yoke. That's
[1:34:54] right. That's right.
[1:34:58] Speaking of all these things, all these
[1:35:01] yolks that you would have, you know, I
[1:35:02] said legalism, religious things, you
[1:35:04] know, as a child coming up through in
[1:35:07] the message young, I seen many things of
[1:35:11] legalism that would try to creep in
[1:35:14] churches. Amen. My there was there was
[1:35:18] one thing and I forgive me if this steps
[1:35:20] on your your shoes this morning, but
[1:35:22] this is what's held prodals from coming
[1:35:24] home is because their stinking legalism
[1:35:27] that they wanted to preach something
[1:35:29] other than this gospel. That's right.
[1:35:31] Come on now. Come on.
[1:35:34] Hey, this is the word.
[1:35:40] You can't wear red dresses.
[1:35:43] Can't wear red dresses. That's legalism.
[1:35:47] Why? There was one thing that I heard
[1:35:48] when I was young growing up said you
[1:35:50] can't have a mustache. And if you have a
[1:35:52] mustache, it's got to be a certain Where
[1:35:55] in the Bible? Come on.
[1:35:59] I I didn't know we were
[1:36:02] union. I mean, that's that's police
[1:36:06] force New York. I I mean, you're union
[1:36:09] workers here on biblical terms here.
[1:36:15] I forgive me. I got a beard. I I'm a
[1:36:19] real sinner this morning.
[1:36:23] My goodness. But as a child, I heard all
[1:36:27] those things of legalism
[1:36:31] and I thought to myself, I want no part
[1:36:36] of any of that. That's right. Bull.
[1:36:39] That's what it was. Just bull. people
[1:36:43] speaking that kind of stuff from the
[1:36:44] pull pit.
[1:36:47] I want it no part. And so what that does
[1:36:50] to you young people, it puts things on
[1:36:52] them that is not actually real.
[1:36:57] Come on.
[1:36:59] Hey, I growing up I hated that nonsense.
[1:37:02] I Oh, I hated that. Yeah, I still hate
[1:37:06] it. Yeah, I hate it even more today
[1:37:09] because we have prodals that are out
[1:37:12] there that is holding on to that thought
[1:37:14] that well I can't do that because that's
[1:37:17] not even true. Well, we don't believe
[1:37:19] that.
[1:37:21] That ain't us.
[1:37:24] There is something that has stepped
[1:37:25] forth and said, "Come out of her, my
[1:37:28] people.
[1:37:30] You are a bride.
[1:37:34] Spotless white raignnt come out of her.
[1:37:38] Prodals come home.
[1:37:41] Come home prodical.
[1:37:43] You won't hear it here.
[1:37:50] I'm here to break that bondage of yoke
[1:37:52] for you this. If that's what's holding
[1:37:53] you back, I'm here to break that this
[1:37:55] morning.
[1:37:56] Jesus Christ was here to break that for
[1:37:59] you. He said, "I'm going to destroy it.
[1:38:02] I'm going to destroy all of those things
[1:38:04] that's been holding y'all back.
[1:38:10] In Matthew, Jesus says, "Come unto
[1:38:14] me all ye labor and are heavy laden, and
[1:38:18] I will give you rest." Amen. Take my
[1:38:22] yoke,
[1:38:25] my yoke upon you, for I am meek and
[1:38:28] lowly in heart and ye shall find rest
[1:38:32] unto your souls. For my yoke is easy
[1:38:38] and my burden is light.
[1:38:41] Now, he is not saying that you're not
[1:38:44] going to have any yoke, but he wants you
[1:38:46] to have his. That's right. And as I was
[1:38:49] speaking of those two oxen, one's a
[1:38:51] leader and one's a follower.
[1:38:55] And he is here to carry the burden
[1:38:59] that you're holding. That yoke,
[1:39:02] it's not a a hard yoke. It's an easy
[1:39:06] one. Thank you, Lord. All ye are
[1:39:08] burdened and heavy laden. I will give
[1:39:11] you rest. That's right. Good. You know,
[1:39:13] I I I love just the fact of when Jesus
[1:39:17] was born in a manger.
[1:39:20] What did Mary wrap him in? Swaddling
[1:39:22] clothes. That's right.
[1:39:24] Maybe she had just pulled it off of a a
[1:39:26] wooden yolk there that morning
[1:39:30] and wrapped him in it.
[1:39:33] It wasn't
[1:39:35] pretty. It wasn't beautiful.
[1:39:38] Smelt like
[1:39:39] oxen.
[1:39:41] sweat,
[1:39:43] hair, laboring through the fields.
[1:39:47] And she wrapped him in it. That's right.
[1:39:51] And then he would come to say, "Take my
[1:39:54] yoke." See, he knew what it was about.
[1:39:58] He knew bondages
[1:40:01] that would hold you.
[1:40:03] I'll give you rest this morning.
[1:40:06] Amen. Yes, Lord. I'll give you peace.
[1:40:10] Yes. I'll break those things that held
[1:40:12] you bound and I will lead you. I will
[1:40:16] lead you through this world. I'll give
[1:40:19] you to a promise. I'll give it over to
[1:40:21] you. Amen. His His yoke won't crush you.
[1:40:26] It won't destroy you. It won't burden
[1:40:28] you with things in a
[1:40:31] life. It will lift you up.
[1:40:35] It'll give you peace. A peace that
[1:40:38] passes all understanding. Amen.
[1:40:42] His yoke, his
[1:40:45] presence brings freedom.
[1:40:49] Freedom awaits you this morning. If
[1:40:53] you're bound by life, by circumstances,
[1:40:56] of things, it awaits you. Freedom awaits
[1:41:01] you this morning. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:41:04] Chains that would hold you back, things
[1:41:07] that would keep you,
[1:41:09] give them over to him. That's what I've
[1:41:12] spoke about all morning here. Give them
[1:41:15] over to him.
[1:41:17] He went to that grave for you. He went
[1:41:22] to that cross for you. His blood was
[1:41:24] shed for you to break every yoke, to
[1:41:28] break every chain that would hold you
[1:41:30] back. Amen. Amen. That's it. I love that
[1:41:33] story of Legion and how
[1:41:37] Jesus there would be coming across the
[1:41:40] waters.
[1:41:42] 10,000
[1:41:43] 10,000 devils would say, "I we got to
[1:41:46] kill him."
[1:41:49] But he would step on the brow of the
[1:41:51] boat. Peace be still. Waves you quiet.
[1:41:56] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:41:58] said, "I can see for Legion's sake there
[1:42:00] was a grayheaded woman on the other side
[1:42:02] there praying for him,
[1:42:06] praying for her son,
[1:42:11] and there he'd come to the shores. There
[1:42:14] he would make his way and
[1:42:17] legion." Maybe we'll just dramatize it
[1:42:20] here for a minute if you don't mind. I I
[1:42:23] like a little drama here. Amen. says,
[1:42:26] "I was legion."
[1:42:30] Maybe he's sitting on a rock there, now
[1:42:33] clothed and in his right mind. And he's
[1:42:36] telling all of the story here, right?
[1:42:42] I was
[1:42:43] legion. Legion now
[1:42:47] free.
[1:42:49] reflecting on what God had done, what
[1:42:52] Jesus had done for
[1:42:54] him. Legion, not because I had a name,
[1:42:59] but because I had no self left. That's
[1:43:01] right. I lived among the
[1:43:04] tombs. Not
[1:43:07] because I like the dead. And that's what
[1:43:10] the spirit will do to you. It'll kill
[1:43:14] you inside. That's right.
[1:43:17] I lived amongst the dead, not because I
[1:43:19] like the dead, but because something
[1:43:21] inside of me had already died.
[1:43:26] Chains, there's no change that could
[1:43:28] hold me.
[1:43:30] But
[1:43:31] freedom, it felt impossible.
[1:43:34] Come on. Oh, the voices, thousands
[1:43:37] screaming lies in my head. Day and night
[1:43:41] screaming.
[1:43:44] They wouldn't
[1:43:47] stop
[1:43:50] trembling. I felt
[1:43:52] blood, my
[1:43:54] blood on my hands,
[1:43:59] but
[1:44:00] then he came.
[1:44:03] Jesus came. Thank you, Lord. I ran
[1:44:06] toward him, not to worship him at
[1:44:09] first. Not at first.
[1:44:14] But those demons inside of me, they knew
[1:44:17] it.
[1:44:19] They said, "Torrman us not."
[1:44:22] They were trembling. They were trembling
[1:44:24] in
[1:44:26] me. Gone.
[1:44:29] With one
[1:44:31] word, one word,
[1:44:35] what no chain could ever do.
[1:44:39] He silenced the voices. He drove them
[1:44:41] out. All of them gone.
[1:44:45] The first time in years I could hear my
[1:44:47] own thoughts. I could feel the sunlight
[1:44:49] on my face and not flinch. I set his
[1:44:53] feet clothed and in my right mind. Amen.
[1:44:57] People were afraid of me.
[1:45:02] Not because I was wild
[1:45:05] anymore, but because of what he had
[1:45:08] done. Amen. Thank you, Lord. And they
[1:45:11] couldn't explain
[1:45:14] it. They weren't afraid of those spirits
[1:45:18] that was in me, but now they was afraid
[1:45:21] for the fact that they could not explain
[1:45:24] what had happened to me.
[1:45:28] I begged to go with
[1:45:31] him. How could I not? Wouldn't you? Oh,
[1:45:34] yeah. Wouldn't after all that he has
[1:45:36] done for you, wouldn't you beg to just
[1:45:39] go with him? He saved me. He saw me. But
[1:45:43] he said, "No, you go home and you tell
[1:45:47] them all that the Lord has
[1:45:49] done and had mercy on you." Amen. All of
[1:45:54] it. So now I tell anyone that will
[1:45:58] listen, there's no chain too strong.
[1:46:02] Come on.
[1:46:04] No, no darkness too deep, no soul too
[1:46:08] lost that Jesus can't set free this
[1:46:11] morning.
[1:46:13] I was legion, but now I am his.
[1:46:21] So whatever chain that you have holding
[1:46:23] you back this morning, he's here to
[1:46:26] break it. Whatever spirit that you have
[1:46:29] holding you back this morning, he's here
[1:46:31] to take that off of you. Amen. He's here
[1:46:33] to break it. I am his. Won't you say say
[1:46:38] I am his.
[1:46:42] I am his. You know, if you say something
[1:46:45] long enough, you actually start
[1:46:47] believing it.
[1:46:49] I am his. Amen. I heard a little thing
[1:46:52] the other day. He said, "If you put I am
[1:46:54] in front of anything you're hoping
[1:46:57] for, most of the time it comes true."
[1:47:00] Why? because that is the greatest one
[1:47:02] that is amongst us. I am.
[1:47:07] I am his.
[1:47:12] Won't you stand with us this
[1:47:14] morning? Aren't you glad you're his this
[1:47:17] morning? Aren't you glad that you can
[1:47:19] say that yoke that held me bound?
[1:47:23] Oh, on resurrection morning. Oh, it's
[1:47:26] Easter. It's Easter this morning.
[1:47:30] The Son is risen. Amen. Hallelujah. He's
[1:47:33] alive. Thank you, Lord. He's alive in
[1:47:35] our hearts today. Aren't you so thankful
[1:47:38] that that he's alive in your heart?
[1:47:41] Amen. Amen. Amen. Maybe we'll sing, I
[1:47:44] know my redeemer
[1:47:46] lives. I know he lives this morning. How
[1:47:50] do you know he lives?
[1:47:53] He's in me. That's it. He's in me. Who
[1:47:57] taught the

[2:00:59] Look what the Lord has
[2:01:03] done. He drove away the darkness at the
[2:01:07] rising of the
[2:01:12] sun.
[2:01:15] Rejoice. Look where he brought us
[2:01:21] from. Stop and think about it. Look what
[2:01:25] the Lord has done.
[2:01:30] I remember way back when I was living in
[2:01:38] darkness. He sent a light around me so I
[2:01:43] could see my way
[2:01:47] out. And when the lamb arose to
[2:01:52] flame, I clearly saw my name.
[2:01:58] And when I think about
[2:02:01] it, I let out a great big
[2:02:05] shout.
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:09] Rejoice. Look what the Lord has
[2:02:14] done. He drove away the darkness at the
[2:02:19] rising of the sun.

[2:02:27] rejoice. Just look where he brought us
[2:02:32] from. Stop and think about it. Look what
[2:02:36] the Lord has
[2:02:41] done. You know the enemy's always trying
[2:02:46] to keep us defeated.
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:51] He always seems to point us to
[2:02:54] everything that's going
[2:02:59] wrong. But if we'll only keep our
[2:03:04] eyes on this message he has brought
[2:03:09] us, the joy will begin to swell up.
[2:03:14] We'll be singing a brand new song.
[2:03:21] Rejoice. Just look what the Lord has
[2:03:26] [Music]
[2:03:35] done. Oh,
[2:03:39] rejoice. Look where he brought us from.

[2:03:52] done. One more time.
[2:03:56] Rejoice. We got something to rejoice
[2:03:58] [Music]
[2:04:03] about. Oh, he drove away the darkness at
[2:04:07] the rising of the sun.
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:13] Oh,
[2:04:16] rejoice. Look where he's brought us
[2:04:21] from. Oh, stop and think about it. Look
[2:04:25] what the Lord has done.
[2:04:30] Aren't you thankful for what the Lord
[2:04:31] has done this morning? Give the Lord a
[2:04:34] hand clap of praise.
[2:04:42] Amen. Before we be dismissed here, I
[2:04:44] want to make an announcement. I had make
[2:04:46] it had forgot to make it earlier. There
[2:04:48] will be Easter goodies for the church in
[2:04:51] the back. For the little kids up to 11
[2:04:55] years old and the yak group ages 12 to
[2:04:58] 20 years old, please see Sister Anna,
[2:05:01] Sister Carly in the back. So, if you
[2:05:03] would, and if they would have extra
[2:05:06] ones, um, they will pass those out as
[2:05:09] well after everything's left over there.
[2:05:11] So, amen. God richly bless you this
[2:05:14] morning. I hope you have a wonderful
[2:05:16] Easter. Amen. Thank you for being such a
[2:05:19] just a tentive group this morning. Thank
[2:05:21] you.
[2:05:26] Let's give our brothers another hand
[2:05:28] clap of praise for the word they brought
[2:05:30] to us this morning and give the Lord
[2:05:32] thanks for the joy and what he's done
[2:05:34] for us. Amen. I believe he's coming back
[2:05:39] as we prepare this morning this message.
[2:05:43] High upon a
[2:05:46] mountain from where he
[2:05:50] ascended, the angel of the Lord
[2:05:54] declared that it would
[2:05:57] be. He said, "Don't stand here a
[2:06:02] grieving for the one that you see
[2:06:06] leaving in like manner is coming back
[2:06:11] for you and me.
[2:06:15] And I believe he's coming back like he
[2:06:23] said. I believe that the trumpet's going
[2:06:27] to sound so loud. One day it's going to
[2:06:30] wake the
[2:06:32] day in the twinkling of an
[2:06:37] eye. He'll split that eastern sky. I
[2:06:42] believe he's coming
[2:06:45] back like a
[2:06:49] sing. I believe the time is
[2:06:54] near that soon we'll see his
[2:06:59] appearing. This could be the hour.
[2:07:04] Oh, this could be the
[2:07:07] day when the saints from every
[2:07:11] nation will lose their
[2:07:15] gravitation in the middle of the air to
[2:07:20] be
[2:07:22] [Music]
[2:07:24] called. And I believe he's coming back
[2:07:30] like he said.
[2:07:34] I believe that the trumpet's going to
[2:07:37] sound so loud one
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:45] day in the dreaming
[2:07:49] of he'll split that eastern sky. I
[2:07:54] believe he's coming
[2:07:57] back like he
[2:08:01] said. Yes, I believe he's coming
[2:08:06] back like he said.
[2:08:12] I believe that the
