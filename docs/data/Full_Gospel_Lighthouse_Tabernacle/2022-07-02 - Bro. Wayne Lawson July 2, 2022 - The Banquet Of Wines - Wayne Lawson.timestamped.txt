[54:53] and
[54:54] i've touched it but i haven't been able

[55:00] breaking into and i pray tonight that
[55:02] you give me grace i won't have time to
[55:04] read all the quotes that i have

[55:29] ask the lord to help us here tonight in
[55:31] the reading of his word faithful lord we
[55:33] thank you tonight for your mercy
[55:36] we thank you for your anointing here
[55:38] upon this meeting
[55:40] lord the special songs that have been
[55:42] sung the blessing lord that has been
[55:44] given already in your anointing and your
[55:46] worship and lord jesus we're just asking
[55:49] you now as we
[55:51] turn to your word lord that your mercy
[55:54] would come and settle over us now father
[55:57] we have been taught that man can open
[56:00] the pages of the bible
[56:02] but it cannot open the meaning of the
[56:04] word
[56:05] it will take you lord
[56:07] and so we ask you tonight that you would
[56:09] just come and that you would settle and
[56:11] visit with us tonight over these
[56:13] scriptures lord may you bless this
[56:15] congregation that's gathered for them
[56:17] that'll be lord may be viewing this by
[56:20] the way
[56:21] of streaming tonight i pray you would
[56:22] help them and bless them
[56:24] and father may you give us instruction
[56:26] and and take us down the paths of
[56:29] righteousness for thy name sake o lord
[56:32] now father we
[56:33] we offer ourselves our mind our heart
[56:37] and lord we're admittedly but right
[56:39] before this congregation before anyone
[56:42] that would hear this
[56:43] that we have no abilities whatsoever
[56:46] that we could help man or that we would
[56:48] know something but
[56:49] lord that if you would just come by and
[56:52] give us grace tonight
[56:54] we would give you all the honor and the
[56:55] glory
[56:56] lord and we give you all the praise we
[56:59] thank you for tonight now in jesus name
[57:02] we pray
[57:03] amen
[57:04] and amen
[57:06] and god bless you if you have your bible
[57:09] isaiah 25 i want to look here in the
[57:12] sixth verse isaiah 25 and verse 6
[57:17] and in the mountain
[57:20] shall the lord of hosts make unto all
[57:22] people a feast of fat things
[57:25] a feast of wines on the leaves
[57:28] of fat things full of moral
[57:31] of wines on the leaves well refined
[57:34] and he will destroy him this mountain
[57:36] the face of the covering cast over all
[57:39] the people
[57:40] and the veil that is spread over all the
[57:43] nations
[57:44] he shall swallow up death in victory
[57:47] and the lord god shall wipe away all the
[57:49] tears from off the earth and rebuke of
[57:51] the people shall be take away from off
[57:54] of all the earth
[57:55] for the lord
[57:57] hath spoken it
[57:59] we ask the lord to bless his word
[58:00] tonight if you could be seated i want to
[58:03] speak to you just a little bit tonight
[58:04] if i would take a title i'd like to
[58:06] speak to you a bit on the banquet of
[58:08] wines
[58:09] on the banquet of wine
[58:11] and uh it's such a it's such a a a
[58:14] scripture uh for me personally because i
[58:17] know that the scripture is dealing with
[58:20] the end time and it's dealing with the
[58:22] time of the changing of the body of the
[58:24] church so we're we're certainly uh
[58:26] thankful that the lord would put
[58:28] something in the scripture for us now
[58:30] last night i was sitting praying about
[58:33] the meeting today and as i was praying i
[58:35] went into the book of jeremiah
[58:38] and i was just just
[58:40] meditating over the scripture and and
[58:42] the lord gave me this and i want to just
[58:44] read it from jeremiah the first chapter
[58:46] in the first fourth verse it says for
[58:48] when the lord of the lord word of the
[58:50] lord came unto me saying
[58:52] before i formed thee in thy belly i knew
[58:55] thee and before thou camest forth out
[58:57] thy womb i sanctified thee
[58:59] and he says and i ordained thee to be a
[59:02] prophet unto the nations
[59:04] then said i o lord god behold i cannot
[59:08] speak for i am a child and the lord said
[59:11] unto me say not that i am a child for
[59:14] thou shalt go to all that i shall send
[59:16] thee and whatsoever i command thou shall
[59:20] speak
[59:21] be not afraid of their faces for i am
[59:24] with thee to deliver thee saith the lord
[59:26] and then the lord put forth his hand and
[59:28] touched my mouth and the lord said unto
[59:30] me behold i have put
[59:33] my words in thy mouth
[59:36] behold i have put my words in thy mouth
[59:40] i think it's a powerful thing tonight to
[59:41] see
[59:42] that god ordains before the foundation
[59:45] of the world the scripture says here
[59:47] that he actually ordained jeremiah even
[59:50] before he was in his mother's womb god
[59:52] ordained him and ordained and the
[59:55] prophet teaches us before the foundation
[59:57] of the world that god ordained him that
[59:59] he would put his words in his mouth now
[1:00:03] i know you're not jeremiah tonight but
[1:00:05] do you know that god has also ordained
[1:00:08] this bride
[1:00:09] from before the foundations of the world
[1:00:13] that he might put his word in your mouth
[1:00:17] can you imagine that you are a
[1:00:19] predestinated
[1:00:21] vessel you are ordained of god that he
[1:00:24] might touch your mouth into this age and
[1:00:27] place his word in you now in saying that
[1:00:30] of course apostle paul helps us to
[1:00:32] understand this in the book of
[1:00:33] corinthians paul will say to us he said
[1:00:36] now
[1:00:37] god what came the word of god out of you
[1:00:41] he said from you or it came unto you
[1:00:44] only
[1:00:45] now if any man think himself to be a
[1:00:48] prophet or spiritual
[1:00:50] let him acknowledge the things which i
[1:00:52] write unto you are the commandments of
[1:00:55] the lord now watch what he's saying to
[1:00:57] you if you are spiritual the word either
[1:01:00] came to you or out of you now of course
[1:01:03] word prophets are born and the word
[1:01:06] comes from them as a vindication they're
[1:01:08] a vindicated vessel amen but the church
[1:01:11] of the living god the bride of christ is
[1:01:14] a prophetic people and a prophetic
[1:01:17] people being that that she is able to
[1:01:19] receive the word of prophecy and it
[1:01:23] literally is taken into her mouth and
[1:01:26] then used as the glory of god so they're
[1:01:28] ordained vessels to not only not not
[1:01:31] that they're trying to come up with
[1:01:32] their own revelation but they're
[1:01:34] ordained to receive the word and then
[1:01:38] they become the word and the word is in
[1:01:40] their mouth now i'm going to read this
[1:01:42] directly from the scripture in
[1:01:43] revelations 10 john said in the eighth
[1:01:46] verse the voice which i heard from
[1:01:48] heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:01:51] and take the little book which is open
[1:01:54] in the hand of the angel which standeth
[1:01:56] upon the sea and upon the earth and i
[1:01:58] went unto the angel and said unto him
[1:02:00] give me this little book and he said
[1:02:01] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:02:04] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:02:06] be in thy mouth sweet as honey now watch
[1:02:09] the prophecy if you take this book you
[1:02:11] eat this book watch it it shall be in
[1:02:15] thy mouth have you ever heard brother
[1:02:17] branham preach a sermon called the
[1:02:19] uncertain sound and he said if the if
[1:02:22] the trumpet would sound uncertain who
[1:02:24] could prepare for the battle is that
[1:02:26] right and the prophet uses this and then
[1:02:28] he goes into the scripture and he said
[1:02:30] there's so many things that are
[1:02:32] uncertain but there are things that are
[1:02:34] certain and then he says see if you
[1:02:36] repent you shall receive the gift of the
[1:02:39] holy ghost if they lay hands on the sick
[1:02:41] they shall recover so brother man then
[1:02:43] goes into the shelbys of the scripture
[1:02:46] things that are positive or are certain
[1:02:49] and here the scripture is saying john
[1:02:52] if you take this book this little open
[1:02:54] book if you take this book and you eat
[1:02:57] this book he said the word shall be in
[1:03:00] thy mouth now i'm not interested tonight
[1:03:02] in how it was tasting or what it done to
[1:03:04] his belly but the beauty of it is the
[1:03:07] word was in his mouth now it wasn't just
[1:03:10] any word but it was the word of the
[1:03:12] season of the redemption of everything
[1:03:15] that had been lost this book that john
[1:03:17] is being invited to eat of course this
[1:03:19] is the book that was closed over in
[1:03:22] revelations the fifth chapter and john
[1:03:24] is not able even to look on that book
[1:03:26] but now he's been invited to take that
[1:03:29] book
[1:03:30] and eat that book and literally the word
[1:03:33] of god will be in his mouth the word of
[1:03:36] all the ages the word of prophecy and of
[1:03:38] truth now what was the difference is
[1:03:41] that the lamb had taken that book and
[1:03:44] the seventh angel had sounded on the
[1:03:46] earth so the word had come unto john
[1:03:50] through a prophet through a prophetic
[1:03:52] ministry and john was able to to receive
[1:03:55] it and the word shall be in thy mouth i
[1:03:58] think it's powerful if you eat this book
[1:04:01] then the word's going to be in your
[1:04:02] mouth of course amen looking at the book
[1:04:04] of revelations it is actually a book of
[1:04:07] symbols and and i don't have time to go
[1:04:09] through all the symbols and there's a
[1:04:10] lot of them amen but if you go through
[1:04:12] the symbols then you start seeing that
[1:04:15] the symbology of the scripture matters
[1:04:17] in other words if it says here that
[1:04:19] there was a white horse writer or a
[1:04:20] black horse writer there's a reality to
[1:04:23] that amen it's only a symbol that means
[1:04:26] something and when john was asked to
[1:04:28] take a book and eat it it's symbology
[1:04:31] that john is being invited to receive a
[1:04:34] revelation that's being released at that
[1:04:37] time because see we didn't need a new
[1:04:39] bible did we we needed a revelation and
[1:04:43] that's the reason the seventh angel had
[1:04:45] to be a prophet because the book was the
[1:04:48] word of god that would be restored to
[1:04:51] this age in revelation it wasn't that we
[1:04:53] didn't have the bible we had the bible
[1:04:56] but we needed a revelation of the bible
[1:04:58] we needed somebody to open up this book
[1:05:01] and to make this book live in the season
[1:05:04] that we're living in and john was being
[1:05:07] invited
[1:05:08] that he would eat that book of course
[1:05:10] it's prophesying of the bride church now
[1:05:12] i know a lot of people stop at the
[1:05:14] seventh angel they read revelations 10
[1:05:16] and that's all in the seventh verse and
[1:05:19] that's all it means to them amen but
[1:05:21] listen amen that's only where it began
[1:05:24] that's only how it began and we know
[1:05:27] right now today the seventh verse of
[1:05:29] revelations 10 is a history lesson to
[1:05:32] the church of the living god but that
[1:05:34] eighth verse through that eleventh verse
[1:05:36] is where the ministry of the bride began
[1:05:39] under the commission just as jesus
[1:05:42] commissioned his disciples this ministry
[1:05:45] of the seventh angel has commissioned an
[1:05:48] end time ministry to preach the greatest
[1:05:51] revelations that's ever been given on
[1:05:53] the face of the earth we are not looking
[1:05:55] for something to say we have been given
[1:05:58] something to say we have been given the
[1:06:01] word of the lord that is the prophecy
[1:06:04] for the changing of your body it's for
[1:06:06] the healing of the soul it's for the
[1:06:08] restitution of your hearts it should
[1:06:11] bring joy and peace and comfort and life
[1:06:14] it is a life-changing message that we
[1:06:16] have been given we have not just been
[1:06:18] given a little message or a little
[1:06:20] inspiration or just a little sermony we
[1:06:23] have been given the entire book released
[1:06:26] in a revelation that will change your
[1:06:29] entire life but because you were
[1:06:32] ordained from the foundation of the
[1:06:34] world you have been given the ability to
[1:06:37] eat the book and to receive the
[1:06:39] revelation that other people are not
[1:06:41] going to receive they're not going to
[1:06:43] believe it but something about you
[1:06:46] that you're able to receive of the grace
[1:06:49] of god in this age i'll tell you what it
[1:06:52] is amen you should take that book you
[1:06:54] should eat that book and the word will
[1:06:57] be in thy mouth
[1:07:00] and it will be sweet as honey if the
[1:07:02] word is in thy mouth it shall be sweet
[1:07:05] as honey i know i'm overdriving it but
[1:07:06] go ahead and give it to me i'll do it
[1:07:09] amen do you see what it is as sweet as
[1:07:11] honey and i took the little book out of
[1:07:12] the angel's hand and it ate it up and it
[1:07:15] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:07:17] soon as i eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:07:19] and he said unto me that i must prophesy
[1:07:21] again before many peoples
[1:07:24] nations tongues
[1:07:26] and kings
[1:07:27] now of course if any man think himself
[1:07:29] to be a spiritual prophet let him
[1:07:31] acknowledge
[1:07:32] let me acknowledge the things which i
[1:07:34] write unto you are the commandments of
[1:07:35] the lord now brother brahman said here's
[1:07:37] the proof
[1:07:38] of the indwelling of the spirit
[1:07:40] it was to acknowledge and follow what
[1:07:43] god's prophet had gave for the age as he
[1:07:46] said in the order paul had to say this
[1:07:48] as he claimed another paul had to say to
[1:07:51] those who claimed another revelation
[1:07:54] came the word of god out of you or came
[1:07:56] it unto you only
[1:07:58] then the evidence of a spirit-filled
[1:08:00] christian believer is not to produce the
[1:08:03] truth word
[1:08:05] but to receive the truth word
[1:08:08] and to obey it now here's the evidence
[1:08:10] of that spirit
[1:08:11] is to receive that now in revelations 22
[1:08:14] 17 it is written that the spirit and the
[1:08:17] bride say come
[1:08:19] and let him that heareth say come
[1:08:23] see the bride speaks the same word as
[1:08:26] does the spirit
[1:08:28] she is a word bride proving she has the
[1:08:31] spirit in every church age we hear these
[1:08:33] words he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:08:36] what the spirit saith unto the church
[1:08:37] the spirit gives the word and if you
[1:08:40] have the spirit you will hear
[1:08:42] the word for your age as true christians
[1:08:45] took the word for their age
[1:08:48] isn't that powerful they meant that you
[1:08:50] are anointed by the spirit to receive
[1:08:54] the word not that you're producing the
[1:08:56] word you're receiving the word amen now
[1:08:59] watch in the book of exodus remember at
[1:09:01] the time of deliverance when moses went
[1:09:03] into the presence of god and he was told
[1:09:05] he was going to be the deliverer of the
[1:09:08] entire children of israel and remember
[1:09:10] he had an argument with god i can't do
[1:09:13] it because i don't speak well
[1:09:16] he actually told him he actually told
[1:09:18] the lord i can't do it i don't speak
[1:09:20] well i my speech i just had some trouble
[1:09:23] i'm not able to do it and the anger of
[1:09:26] the lord was kindled against moses and
[1:09:27] he said it's not aaron levi thy brother
[1:09:30] and i know that he can speak well behold
[1:09:32] he cometh forth to meet thee and when he
[1:09:34] seeth thee he will be glad in his heart
[1:09:36] and thou shalt speak unto him and put
[1:09:39] words in his mouth
[1:09:42] now look at the beauty of this and i
[1:09:44] will be with thy mouth
[1:09:47] as with his mouth
[1:09:49] and will teach you what you shall do god
[1:09:51] just told him moses and i know you don't
[1:09:54] speak well aaron speaks well but you put
[1:09:57] the words in his mouth and when he
[1:09:59] speaks the words you have spoken i will
[1:10:02] be with his mouth the same as i am with
[1:10:04] yours
[1:10:06] can you imagine that whenever that god
[1:10:09] was laying out a principle that there
[1:10:12] would be a church a bride come in the
[1:10:14] last days that would take this very
[1:10:17] principle when god said unto moses i
[1:10:21] will make you a god unto the people and
[1:10:24] i will make aaron a prophet unto you
[1:10:27] they meant to find that this bride would
[1:10:29] be a prophetic people amen that god
[1:10:33] would entire the entire congregation not
[1:10:35] just the preachers not just the
[1:10:37] ministries but the entire bride of
[1:10:39] christ will be the anointed bright body
[1:10:43] of jesus christ who is anointed by the
[1:10:46] word that was turned down in the garden
[1:10:48] of eden but is returned unto this age
[1:10:51] and the bride is receiving that word and
[1:10:55] she is eating that word and she is
[1:10:57] speaking that word what is it amen it
[1:11:00] shall be in thy mouth amen and i will be
[1:11:04] with your mouth same as i am with his
[1:11:06] mouth now look at the power of that if
[1:11:07] god's going to ask you to do something
[1:11:09] he's got to provide the need
[1:11:10] if god's going to say to you you're
[1:11:12] going to do a certain thing then he's
[1:11:14] got to provide whatever it is to do what
[1:11:17] he said you're going to do he said i
[1:11:20] you'll lay your hands on the sick and
[1:11:21] they shall recover he's got to give you
[1:11:23] the spirit to be able to recover them if
[1:11:26] you're going to do it god's got to
[1:11:28] provide the need to do so with his grace
[1:11:31] now watch because the scripture is
[1:11:33] predicting that in the end time there
[1:11:36] will be a restitution of all things in
[1:11:38] acts the third chapter the bible said
[1:11:40] repent you therefore be converted to
[1:11:42] your sins that we blotted out for when
[1:11:44] the times of refreshing shall come from
[1:11:46] the presence of the lord he shall send
[1:11:49] jesus christ which was preached unto you
[1:11:52] whom heaven must receive until the times
[1:11:55] of the restitution of all things which
[1:11:58] god has spoken by the mouth of all of
[1:12:00] his holy prophets since the world began
[1:12:03] for moses truly said unto our fathers a
[1:12:06] prophet shall the lord your god raise
[1:12:09] unto you of your brethren like and unto
[1:12:11] me
[1:12:12] him shall ye hear in all things and
[1:12:15] whatsoever he shall say unto you amen it
[1:12:18] shall come to pass that every soul which
[1:12:20] will not hear the prophet shall be
[1:12:22] destroyed from among the people and it
[1:12:25] shall come to pass amen that every soul
[1:12:28] which will not hear that prophet shall
[1:12:30] be destroyed from among the people yea
[1:12:33] and all the prophets from samuel and
[1:12:35] those that follow after as many as have
[1:12:37] spoken likewise have foretold these days
[1:12:41] look at the beauty of how that paul here
[1:12:43] in the book of acts is putting out the
[1:12:45] idea that that literally was coming a
[1:12:49] refreshing in the last days at the time
[1:12:52] of restitution now y'all know what
[1:12:54] refreshing is refreshing is a revealing
[1:12:57] of the holy ghost it's a refreshment
[1:13:00] that would be
[1:13:01] coming from the presence of almighty god
[1:13:05] in other words there is a there's a
[1:13:07] refreshment that will come into the
[1:13:09] church that you're not going to get it
[1:13:11] from drinking beer or whiskey or not
[1:13:14] just a little wine now and again this is
[1:13:16] not the refreshment the bible's talking
[1:13:18] about the bible is talking about the
[1:13:21] refreshment of the book of isaiah that
[1:13:23] said when stammering lives in other
[1:13:25] tongues well i speak there unto my
[1:13:27] people and this is the rest wherein i
[1:13:29] cause the weary to rest this is the
[1:13:32] refreshing from god this is the
[1:13:34] refreshing he's talking about it's when
[1:13:37] the holy ghost is released among the
[1:13:39] people to fulfill the word of god it'll
[1:13:42] become a refreshing under that church it
[1:13:45] will refresh their hearts it'll refresh
[1:13:47] their lives do you see the presence of
[1:13:50] god will do something for you that
[1:13:52] nothing else is going to do the presence
[1:13:54] of god will change you in a way nothing
[1:13:57] else can change you you cannot counsel
[1:14:00] it you cannot teach it you cannot you
[1:14:02] cannot shake hands enough i cannot
[1:14:05] counsel you enough but if a man ever one
[1:14:08] time comes into the presence of god
[1:14:11] it'll change everything it'll change
[1:14:14] your life it'll change your attitude
[1:14:16] it'll change your ability you may be
[1:14:19] down to nothing but get in the presence
[1:14:22] of god and he'll refresh you amen oh
[1:14:25] come on we might as well preach here
[1:14:27] tonight this is an eagle age isn't it
[1:14:30] isn't it an eagle age aren't you eagles
[1:14:33] and the prophet said he called you an
[1:14:35] eagle for a reason
[1:14:37] he said because it's the only bird that
[1:14:39] can be all the way down and be brought
[1:14:43] all the way back again an eagle can be
[1:14:46] renewed faith that wait upon the lord
[1:14:49] shall renew their strength well i'll
[1:14:51] tell you this we have waited on the lord
[1:14:53] and we have come into the time of the
[1:14:56] refreshment of the holy ghost that's
[1:14:58] come upon the church it's in a season of
[1:15:00] refreshment in a season of refreshing
[1:15:03] that has come upon us you say well hey
[1:15:06] man what are you what are you really
[1:15:07] speaking of let's just talk about it a
[1:15:09] minute he meant in the presence of god
[1:15:11] unrecognized how many knows brother
[1:15:12] branham told us how to recognize the
[1:15:14] presence of god
[1:15:17] he told us here in topeka in 1964
[1:15:20] in the message
[1:15:21] in the message the presence of god
[1:15:23] unrecognized
[1:15:25] isn't that something that god could be
[1:15:27] present and not be recognized
[1:15:30] he said if we could only do that tonight
[1:15:32] if we could only realize that he is
[1:15:35] appearing to us in these meetings for
[1:15:37] one purpose
[1:15:39] that's to release our desires that we
[1:15:41] have in him to us
[1:15:43] but we've got to recognize his presence
[1:15:47] and now how to recognize his presence
[1:15:50] is when the promised word for this age
[1:15:53] is made manifest
[1:15:55] not the promised word for moses's age or
[1:15:58] any other age the promised word for this
[1:16:01] age so the promised word for this age
[1:16:04] revelations 10 luke 17 malachi 4 joel
[1:16:07] chapter 2 these scriptures when you see
[1:16:10] them fulfilled they are announcing the
[1:16:13] presence of almighty god only god can
[1:16:17] fulfill his word only god can make a
[1:16:20] virgin conceive only god can make the
[1:16:22] bible live that it takes god to do it so
[1:16:25] when you see the scriptures come alive
[1:16:28] it's god himself that is making them
[1:16:31] live it's god that makes the scripture
[1:16:33] live and when you see that living it's
[1:16:36] god's presence among them now i know
[1:16:39] amen the word for the age we're living
[1:16:40] in and a command that god has put upon
[1:16:43] us now i don't know what your situation
[1:16:45] is here tonight some of you i haven't
[1:16:47] seen you in a while some of you i don't
[1:16:49] know but i i can i just preach to you
[1:16:51] now can i'm not going to talk about our
[1:16:53] problem i'm going to talk about our
[1:16:54] answer amen it no matter what the
[1:16:56] problem here's the answer amen the
[1:16:59] prophet of god said my ministry was
[1:17:01] different than other ministries he said
[1:17:04] my ministry is from different from a
[1:17:06] pastor or a teacher and if i say things
[1:17:08] wrong brother and forgive me i don't
[1:17:10] mean to do it but this is my ministry to
[1:17:14] declare him that he
[1:17:17] is here
[1:17:19] oh glory to god i tell you what you
[1:17:22] ought to do right now you are to tell
[1:17:24] every devil that's told you that god has
[1:17:27] left you and that he's not with you and
[1:17:30] that god's not in the midst of the
[1:17:31] church and he's not showing up in our
[1:17:33] meetings you are to tell that devil
[1:17:35] tonight you're a lying devil
[1:17:38] a vindicated word prophet said his only
[1:17:42] ministry was to declare him that he is
[1:17:46] here
[1:17:47] i don't care what you see he's here i
[1:17:50] don't care what you feel he's here i
[1:17:53] don't care what you think he is here
[1:17:55] right now jesus christ is alive i
[1:17:58] propose to you that jesus is not dead i
[1:18:01] say he rose up from the grave and he's
[1:18:04] living and he's alive and not only is he
[1:18:06] there he's right here in this building
[1:18:08] right now in another dimension pressing
[1:18:11] into this dimension by the power of god
[1:18:14] if you don't know he's here you are to
[1:18:16] shake loose from that numbing spirit
[1:18:18] that the devil has placed on you to
[1:18:20] unbelieve god and say i will not believe
[1:18:24] my eyes i might not see him but my faith
[1:18:28] declares he's here he's here in this
[1:18:31] building he's here to change my life
[1:18:33] he's here to bring grace into my heart
[1:18:36] [Applause]
[1:18:39] i believe he's here
[1:18:40] [Applause]
[1:18:42] you ain't going to convince me otherwise
[1:18:44] i've got a word prophet saying he's here
[1:18:47] that he's here you can declare it
[1:18:49] brother you can climb to the highest
[1:18:51] mountain you can go to the biggest
[1:18:53] churches you can walk in the middle of a
[1:18:55] bunch of formal intellectuals amen and
[1:18:58] you can declare to them christ is here
[1:19:01] amen wherever two or three are gathered
[1:19:04] in my name there shall i be in the midst
[1:19:07] of them yet a little while and the world
[1:19:09] sees me no more but you shall see me for
[1:19:12] i will be with you even in you until the
[1:19:15] end of the age and
[1:19:17] y'all got to forgive me but i think we
[1:19:18] ought to do it i think we are to climb
[1:19:20] to the highest mountain and take a bail
[1:19:23] and go to ringing it and make a
[1:19:25] declaration of the presence of god and
[1:19:28] to declare that you might have to sell
[1:19:30] something you might have to forsake
[1:19:32] something you might have to walk away
[1:19:34] from a tradition or a creed or an idea
[1:19:37] but whatever it costs you've got to say
[1:19:40] it from your heart he is here he's
[1:19:43] hearing this meeting tonight
[1:19:48] now i'm going to a realm that's greater
[1:19:50] than your feelings
[1:19:53] because sometimes you don't maybe feel
[1:19:55] maybe you don't feel like he's here
[1:19:59] what does that mean then i just quit
[1:20:00] because i don't feel that he's here no
[1:20:03] amen there are times that my body don't
[1:20:05] feel like it there's times my mind don't
[1:20:08] feel like it at times there's low spots
[1:20:10] in my in my spirit where it don't feel
[1:20:12] like it but in the inner man there is a
[1:20:15] soul down in there and there's a
[1:20:17] believer in there and that believer
[1:20:19] hears the word and when the word says
[1:20:22] he's here the mouth of a believer must
[1:20:24] confess what the word
[1:20:31] now the prophet of god said this
[1:20:33] in the presence of god unrecognized the
[1:20:35] greatest pleasure i know of is to be
[1:20:37] pray until i can realize i'm in the
[1:20:39] presence of god
[1:20:40] and recognize it
[1:20:43] i think that ought to be the thrill of
[1:20:45] the church he says
[1:20:47] it's the presence of the holy spirit
[1:20:48] seeing that god made the promise
[1:20:50] standing among us feel his presence
[1:20:53] see his word and see it's vindicated it
[1:20:56] ought to give faith
[1:20:57] in order to make cripples walk blind see
[1:20:59] deaf here and dumb to speak
[1:21:02] i tell you this i want some inspiration
[1:21:05] i desire inspiration you desire
[1:21:07] inspiration there's been a lot of
[1:21:09] inspirations
[1:21:10] we're
[1:21:11] we're coming late in the game in the
[1:21:12] message there's been a lot of
[1:21:13] inspirations there's been thunder
[1:21:14] inspiration perugia inspiration every
[1:21:16] kind of inspiration
[1:21:18] but every one of those inspirations
[1:21:19] ended up rallying around a man a
[1:21:22] personality
[1:21:23] but there is one inspiration that will
[1:21:26] end up at the feet of jesus and the
[1:21:28] inspirations the one the prophet
[1:21:30] introduced to us i've heard but now i
[1:21:32] see in 1965 he said remember in your
[1:21:34] heart you're sitting there make a little
[1:21:36] altar come into my heart now and give me
[1:21:39] something
[1:21:40] something i can hold to
[1:21:42] let me feel the inspiration
[1:21:45] that you're present
[1:21:48] let that be the inspiration of the
[1:21:50] church he's present
[1:21:52] let that be the inspiration of the
[1:21:53] ministry he's here
[1:21:55] he's here he's present right now he's
[1:21:57] ready to perform you see this is what
[1:22:01] hell is against
[1:22:05] now it's okay most anybody will get with
[1:22:08] us
[1:22:08] he was here when we're talking about
[1:22:10] 1906 or 1925. we're talking about 1940s
[1:22:14] or 1950s or 1960s and they see the the
[1:22:17] manifestations of a prophet's life and
[1:22:20] they see the great things that were
[1:22:21] happening they're all good about that
[1:22:23] but the the what hell is against
[1:22:26] is the spiritual revelation that he is
[1:22:29] here now
[1:22:31] that's what hell is against is that you
[1:22:34] can declare he's here now
[1:22:36] that you can stand against all of hell
[1:22:39] we're the revelation and say he's here
[1:22:41] now see he's here with power
[1:22:44] but many do if they are not knowing the
[1:22:46] scripture
[1:22:48] because someone says well that was
[1:22:50] another day it was for another time see
[1:22:53] that was for another season and this
[1:22:55] happened and this didn't happen in this
[1:22:57] way and and and unknowingly
[1:23:00] many men take the spirit of the church
[1:23:03] of christ while trying to preach the
[1:23:05] message of the hour
[1:23:07] they literally say that all of the
[1:23:10] miracles were done to prove the message
[1:23:12] in the days of a prophet but there would
[1:23:14] be no reason for that miracle working
[1:23:16] god to be among us today
[1:23:18] which is exactly the church of christ
[1:23:20] the baptist have another theory amen
[1:23:22] that that god's alive and if you just
[1:23:25] come shake my hand then you got it
[1:23:27] already but we've heard those same
[1:23:29] spirits right in the in the pulpits
[1:23:31] which should be the message of the hour
[1:23:33] which where brother branham said the
[1:23:35] second crucifixion of jesus christ would
[1:23:37] not be done on a cross it would be done
[1:23:39] in the pulpit he said where they kill
[1:23:42] the effect of the word
[1:23:45] you see we have the word amen and if we
[1:23:48] would plead the promise the word would
[1:23:50] be effective unless somebody stands
[1:23:53] there and says well it's not for this
[1:23:55] day it can't happen now there's no way
[1:23:57] for it to take place amen but you will
[1:24:00] never stop true revelation you will
[1:24:03] never stop true revelation from coming
[1:24:06] to the church of the living god once it
[1:24:08] becomes a part of you you cannot kill it
[1:24:11] once revelation drops into the soul you
[1:24:14] can never take revelation out of the
[1:24:18] soul of a man
[1:24:20] it's what becomes revelation you see
[1:24:22] what it is amen according to scripture
[1:24:24] the great i am was the return of the
[1:24:26] last day the the very the very elohim
[1:24:30] was to come into the bride the very one
[1:24:33] who was called melchizedek
[1:24:35] literally would take flesh in the last
[1:24:37] day and use humanity to prove that jesus
[1:24:41] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:24:44] forever
[1:24:45] do you know today we're living here and
[1:24:48] the prophet would say to us headship is
[1:24:51] here
[1:24:52] and our headship is a messiah is it not
[1:24:56] the messiah of the bride is the anointed
[1:25:00] word of the age
[1:25:02] brother braham said what we need today
[1:25:04] is a message anointed with the
[1:25:05] messiahship of christ
[1:25:07] it's what we needed right
[1:25:09] now in the world falling apart he said
[1:25:11] watch he said he came to be a national
[1:25:14] or church political if the messiah he
[1:25:16] never came to be national or political
[1:25:18] church if the messiah would come today
[1:25:21] he would not be a national or church
[1:25:23] politician
[1:25:25] he would if we would cry for such a
[1:25:27] person god would send us deliverance but
[1:25:30] we've got to receive it the way he sends
[1:25:33] it
[1:25:34] they didn't do that they warned it in
[1:25:37] that way and the church cries today oh
[1:25:40] father will you please send jesus to us
[1:25:43] will you please
[1:25:45] and when the holy spirit begins to move
[1:25:48] they don't want that
[1:25:51] will you send jesus but when the holy
[1:25:53] ghost begins to move they don't want
[1:25:55] that
[1:25:56] see because in this age that you're
[1:25:59] living in this is the age of the holy
[1:26:02] ghost this is when the holy ghost
[1:26:04] manifested itself in the church of the
[1:26:07] living god by divine promise of the word
[1:26:11] in this age what is it it's the word
[1:26:13] amen it's god's messiah it's his
[1:26:16] anointed word to anoint his church and
[1:26:18] send it back to the word now not some
[1:26:21] man is the messiah
[1:26:23] it's the holy spirit is the messiah now
[1:26:25] i'm reading quotes directly it's the
[1:26:27] holy spirit is the messiah christ and
[1:26:30] the holy spirit is the same thing so
[1:26:32] here it is now working in the flesh
[1:26:36] getting the bride ready for rapturing
[1:26:39] grace what is it amen he sends his
[1:26:42] messiah but there's a lot of people
[1:26:44] don't want it but the bible said he came
[1:26:48] unto his own and his own received him
[1:26:50] not but as to many as received him to
[1:26:53] them he gave power to become the sons of
[1:26:56] god not that they become sons of god
[1:26:59] they were having liberty to exercise as
[1:27:03] sons of god amen if you're a son you
[1:27:05] always were a son and that's the reason
[1:27:08] you have received the message of the
[1:27:11] hour and it brings liberty it brings
[1:27:13] power it brings reality listen if you're
[1:27:16] listening to messages that are taking
[1:27:18] the power out of the church taking the
[1:27:20] worship out of the church you're
[1:27:22] listening some intellectual man always
[1:27:24] talking about what god used to do but we
[1:27:26] can't do this anymore amen let me tell
[1:27:28] you you not listen to the message of the
[1:27:30] hour the message of the hour is jesus
[1:27:34] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:27:37] forever i say the god that i serve is an
[1:27:40] omnipotent god and he's so powerful that
[1:27:43] if you can put him anywhere and he still
[1:27:46] remains to be god
[1:27:47] you cannot diminish my god by the place
[1:27:50] you put him in you can put him in weight
[1:27:52] loss and he's still a mighty god you can
[1:27:54] put him in andrew he's still a mighty
[1:27:56] god you can put him in any believer in
[1:27:58] the spiel and he remains to be the same
[1:28:03] he is unconquered by tradition
[1:28:07] he said preacher what are you getting at
[1:28:08] i thought i think i you know what i'm
[1:28:10] getting at to them that receive the holy
[1:28:12] ghost amen have been given power to
[1:28:15] exercise
[1:28:16] they've been given power to bring
[1:28:18] authority of that spirit in the church
[1:28:20] of the living god i know what it's about
[1:28:23] i know the day we're living it's it's
[1:28:24] more popular to talk about what god used
[1:28:27] to do
[1:28:28] what god used to do you know what
[1:28:30] brother brahm called that he called it a
[1:28:31] painted fire
[1:28:34] when you're explaining to somebody the
[1:28:36] god of yesterday you are painting them a
[1:28:39] fire but brother branham said it never
[1:28:41] warmed the hands of a cold man and the
[1:28:44] painted fire of this age will never warn
[1:28:47] the heart of a believer in this cold air
[1:28:50] odyssey you've got to bring the same god
[1:28:53] that was in this bible that was in the
[1:28:56] days of elijah and he's got to step on
[1:28:58] the platform again and manifest himself
[1:29:02] with authority and power let me tell you
[1:29:04] this what's wrong today is men is scared
[1:29:06] to take that challenge they're scared to
[1:29:09] say he's the same because they don't
[1:29:11] know he's the same they never met him
[1:29:13] the same but listen let me tell you this
[1:29:15] i'm not scared of that unbelieving
[1:29:17] skeptical devil the god that i serve is
[1:29:20] still a miracle working god he's still
[1:29:22] the god that can open blind eyes he can
[1:29:25] raise the dead the cripples can walk
[1:29:27] because he remains to be god i'm not
[1:29:31] scared to say that my god can change
[1:29:33] life that my god can feel with the holy
[1:29:36] ghost somebody said well i don't know if
[1:29:38] he could then you've never met my god my
[1:29:40] god is not dead my god is alive and he's
[1:29:44] powerful and he's reality i met him i
[1:29:48] talked to him he talked back to me and
[1:29:51] every devil in hell lost power the
[1:29:55] morning i met him
[1:29:58] well somebody give the lord a shout
[1:30:01] shout a loud old daughter of zion
[1:30:05] tell that unbelieving devil got no place
[1:30:07] in here tonight
[1:30:10] that devil tried to torment you i hate
[1:30:13] that lying devil
[1:30:15] you know what he is andrew he's a
[1:30:17] tormentor isn't he but he's not only a
[1:30:19] tormentor he's a liar
[1:30:21] so he don't care to lie to torment you
[1:30:24] he will tell you a lie and torment you
[1:30:27] by the lie he's telling you but i'll
[1:30:29] tell you this i've got a god that can
[1:30:32] dissolve every doubt he can straighten
[1:30:34] up every lie and when the word of god is
[1:30:37] preached there's a power and an
[1:30:39] authority to break that spirit away from
[1:30:42] the church of the living god
[1:30:44] i'll tell you this god god sent
[1:30:46] something in this age he sent the word
[1:30:48] in this age the anointing in this age he
[1:30:51] sent the
[1:30:52] he sent the revelation in this age
[1:30:56] now
[1:30:57] now
[1:30:58] when the word is being fulfilled
[1:31:01] it renews the vision
[1:31:04] it brings refreshment
[1:31:06] y'all know y'all ever y'all ever needed
[1:31:08] that
[1:31:08] you ever been in a cold spot in your
[1:31:10] life you've been in a place where you
[1:31:11] need some refreshing let me tell you
[1:31:13] there's a place you can drink tonight
[1:31:15] that'll refresh you
[1:31:17] it'll bring you what you need
[1:31:19] do you know that moses was an anointed
[1:31:21] man he was actually born for purpose
[1:31:25] moses was was an intellectual man taught
[1:31:28] by his mother
[1:31:29] and even knew the children of israel was
[1:31:31] to get deliverance
[1:31:33] but now he tried it on his own failed
[1:31:36] you know what he ended up he ended up 40
[1:31:37] years on the backside of the desert
[1:31:41] he ended up back there and the prophet
[1:31:42] of god said think of moses how that
[1:31:45] moses standing there on the mountain
[1:31:46] side by that burning bush he had lost
[1:31:49] all hope of freedom
[1:31:52] in the absence of the presence of god
[1:31:55] from your consciousness
[1:31:56] you lose hope of freedom
[1:31:59] you lose hope of change
[1:32:02] you lose hope when there is no reality
[1:32:05] of presence
[1:32:07] now watch what the prophet says he said
[1:32:08] he lost all the hopes of freedom didn't
[1:32:11] seem like freedom for that people he so
[1:32:14] gallantly stood for one time
[1:32:17] now moses had killed a man for that
[1:32:18] freedom
[1:32:20] and now he was standing there wondering
[1:32:22] if there was such
[1:32:24] a man
[1:32:25] but the problem was
[1:32:27] that he was absent from the presence of
[1:32:30] god
[1:32:31] now that god was there the same as he
[1:32:33] had always been but moses was not aware
[1:32:36] he was not aware of what god was going
[1:32:38] to do brother bam said see i think it's
[1:32:41] the same today many of us lose sight of
[1:32:43] our freedom
[1:32:46] many of us lose the moment you lose
[1:32:48] sight of the presence of god you have
[1:32:50] lost sight of your freedom
[1:32:53] that's why there's many people sitting
[1:32:55] in churches today bound
[1:32:57] when men teach the holy spirit for
[1:33:00] another day
[1:33:03] if he's here now he's hearing the holy
[1:33:04] spirit
[1:33:06] right the corporate body's in heaven if
[1:33:08] it wasn't we wouldn't be preaching
[1:33:10] tonight
[1:33:11] so if he's here he hears the holy spirit
[1:33:13] when you put the holy spirit out of the
[1:33:16] church you have removed the presence of
[1:33:19] god from the church and the people
[1:33:22] become in bondage
[1:33:24] look what he says here the prophet of
[1:33:26] god and god's arab deliverance he said
[1:33:27] why brother if we had ever come in the
[1:33:29] presence of god like moses did it was
[1:33:32] revolutionary to him
[1:33:34] and it would revolutionize this for july
[1:33:37] week and be a good weekend for this
[1:33:38] wouldn't it and it would revolutionize
[1:33:41] he said in the light of that angel of
[1:33:43] god standing there on that mountain that
[1:33:45] day
[1:33:46] everything he once had or thought he
[1:33:49] never would happen come to reality
[1:33:53] everything he thought well it would
[1:33:54] never happen we used to think it could
[1:33:56] but now we don't know if it will he said
[1:33:59] right there in the presence of that
[1:34:00] angel of god it become reality it became
[1:34:04] illuminated i think of men and women
[1:34:06] today if they would ever step in the
[1:34:08] light of the holy spirit look at the
[1:34:10] prophet he steps in the light of the
[1:34:12] holy spirit under the unction of god's
[1:34:14] spirit and light of god's word
[1:34:16] everything god has promised will
[1:34:19] illuminate to you and be real again
[1:34:24] my and be real again
[1:34:27] see what happened to moses now some of
[1:34:29] you with us in the meeting i'm act like
[1:34:30] some of you wasn't because this was very
[1:34:32] important
[1:34:33] moses was standing there and when he
[1:34:35] began to receive the instruction from
[1:34:37] the lord the lord said i have remembered
[1:34:39] my promise of my children and he said i
[1:34:42] have promised i will deliver them with a
[1:34:45] mighty hand god made that promise to
[1:34:46] them so the word of noah's day would not
[1:34:49] help the children of god in moses's day
[1:34:53] building an ark would not help them in
[1:34:56] egypt wouldn't help them
[1:34:57] because it wasn't fitting for the need
[1:35:00] of their age
[1:35:01] do you see why it's so important to know
[1:35:04] the message of your season what is the
[1:35:07] anointing of where you're living what's
[1:35:09] going on now you've got to know where
[1:35:11] that anointing is and watch what he's
[1:35:13] doing he's sitting there talking to
[1:35:15] angel the lord he said i've come down i
[1:35:17] have remembered my promise that i made
[1:35:19] to abraham i shall deliver my people
[1:35:21] with a mighty hand and remember then the
[1:35:23] anointing from that burning bush begins
[1:35:25] to ignite moses faith
[1:35:27] amen and rehearses to him makes it
[1:35:29] illuminates makes real that there's a
[1:35:31] deliverer going and he asks that
[1:35:33] wonderful question to the lord now who
[1:35:36] can i say is sent me down here
[1:35:39] who can i tell the people that has sent
[1:35:43] me to deliver them he said you tell them
[1:35:45] the i am sent you
[1:35:48] not the i was
[1:35:49] not the i will be you tell them the i am
[1:35:52] sent you
[1:35:53] now when you give him the anointed ones
[1:35:55] of the end time brother madam handles
[1:35:56] that scripture differently than i ever
[1:35:59] heard him handle it and he takes the i
[1:36:01] am and he says watch he says the i am
[1:36:04] sent me he said the promised word sent
[1:36:07] him
[1:36:08] what was sending him
[1:36:10] was the promise to abraham
[1:36:13] being fulfilled
[1:36:15] he was walking because god was keeping
[1:36:17] his word to abraham
[1:36:19] what was making him go to egypt was god
[1:36:22] had promised abraham and now that word
[1:36:25] was in season and abraham amen not
[1:36:28] knowing this moses was a part of the
[1:36:31] promise that abraham had been given of
[1:36:32] god moses was in the part of the i am he
[1:36:36] was the manifest he was the fulfillment
[1:36:39] part of the promise and look what he
[1:36:42] said the i am sent me
[1:36:44] are we getting it together the i am sent
[1:36:46] me the word sent me in other words
[1:36:49] noah's noah's promise didn't send me
[1:36:51] it was abraham's promise sent me i've
[1:36:54] come because god made a promise to
[1:36:55] abraham seed that's why i'm here so the
[1:36:57] i am sent me now notice in the hour
[1:37:00] we're living in the same i am is still
[1:37:04] alive

[1:37:08] still the i am so there is promises of
[1:37:11] this age that has sent us to this place

[1:37:18] to talk to you a minute gideon i want
[1:37:20] you to hear me i want you to hear me

[1:37:48] in the bible that i will bring a
[1:37:51] refreshing in the presence of the lord

[1:39:04] your stories it's time to remember that
[1:39:06] the god of elijah is still the god of
[1:39:11] jesus christ and he lives in the church
[1:39:14] of the living god he still opens blinded
[1:39:17] eyes he still raises the dead he still
[1:39:20] changes hearts
[1:39:22] [Applause]
[1:39:24] don't tell me about a god that used to
[1:39:26] be if i can't preach he's the same
[1:39:28] tonight
[1:39:30] i was over in europe one time i was in
[1:39:32] heavy prayer because i was with and i
[1:39:35] love the european people god bless you
[1:39:37] but they was just a little bit tight on
[1:39:38] me and bless their hearts amen i i
[1:39:42] preached a little fast and i
[1:39:44] i think i was a little too excited
[1:39:47] sometimes eating that gun powder make
[1:39:48] you away brother and
[1:39:50] and i i was a little excited so i went
[1:39:52] back to my room and i was praying before
[1:39:55] the lord god you've got to give me
[1:39:56] something to get the attention these
[1:39:58] people they think i'm a rudimentary
[1:40:01] baby in the message you know you got to
[1:40:03] give me something lord you got to give
[1:40:04] me something and i just haven't been
[1:40:06] listening to a tape and all of a sudden
[1:40:08] on the tape i could hear brother branham
[1:40:10] he said now listen
[1:40:11] he said if you're going to be a preacher
[1:40:14] he said i suggest that you preach jesus
[1:40:17] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:40:20] forever he said now if you're not going
[1:40:22] to preach that go be a farmer or a
[1:40:24] lawyer or anything else but don't you be
[1:40:27] a preacher amen and i'll tell you this
[1:40:30] if we're going to preach this message
[1:40:32] we're going to have to preach jesus
[1:40:33] christ it's the same yesterday today and
[1:40:37] forever if he come down on the upper
[1:40:40] room and filled 120 hearts he's still
[1:40:43] given the holy ghost if god did it for
[1:40:46] them he can do it for you if he healed
[1:40:49] he's still healing if he's saved he's
[1:40:51] still saving
[1:40:56] now it's not the i was
[1:40:58] it's the i am
[1:41:00] now
[1:41:01] now if you notice this i got one but
[1:41:04] thank you he said where the carcass is
[1:41:07] he said there the eagles are gathered
[1:41:09] together
[1:41:11] in matthew 24 where the carcass is there
[1:41:15] the eagles are gathered together now
[1:41:17] brother branham
[1:41:18] what does that mean where the carcass is
[1:41:20] they're the eagles he said well that
[1:41:22] carcass now he said that's christ
[1:41:25] that's the word
[1:41:27] of your season
[1:41:29] you're feeding on jesus when you're
[1:41:32] feeding
[1:41:33] on the word
[1:41:35] of your season
[1:41:38] now jesus said how often i would have
[1:41:39] gathered you
[1:41:41] ah i
[1:41:42] how oft i would have gathered you
[1:41:45] when he's feeding the church the message
[1:41:49] he's gathering the eagles to the carcass
[1:41:52] of the word
[1:41:53] it's there at that carcass the carcass
[1:41:56] of the i am it is there that they feed
[1:42:00] for their eternal life
[1:42:02] it is there that they feed and draw into
[1:42:06] them life-giving protein
[1:42:09] life-giving meat
[1:42:10] life-giving nourishment comes into them
[1:42:14] it's a feast or could i call it a
[1:42:16] banquet when the killing of the word in
[1:42:20] its season what is it it's an invitation
[1:42:22] for the church to come and dine
[1:42:26] now you know what's written in
[1:42:27] revelation the third chapter behold i
[1:42:29] stand at the door and dock and if any
[1:42:30] man would open the door i'll come into
[1:42:32] him and sup with him and he with me
[1:42:35] so the voice of god's knocking on your
[1:42:36] heart and brother ram said he's knocking
[1:42:38] on your heart he wants to get in he said
[1:42:40] now what's he's going to do he's going
[1:42:41] to have supper with you
[1:42:44] that's pretty good
[1:42:45] the lord's going to have supper with you
[1:42:47] now what does that mean to the church he
[1:42:50] said he's going to take
[1:42:51] the hidden things in the scripture and
[1:42:54] reveal them unto you
[1:42:57] he's going to have
[1:42:59] he's going to have an evening communion
[1:43:01] with the church
[1:43:05] now
[1:43:07] jesus is going to be serving communion
[1:43:10] in the end time
[1:43:13] this same principle is preached from the
[1:43:16] book of genesis
[1:43:18] when melchizedek meets abraham
[1:43:21] and remember what he done
[1:43:23] he produced a wine
[1:43:25] and a bread at that communion
[1:43:28] now melchizedek could
[1:43:30] communion had never been given
[1:43:33] but now abraham was receiving wine and
[1:43:36] bread he didn't bring
[1:43:38] that's that's that's that's pretty
[1:43:40] powerful stuff
[1:43:42] he didn't produce it
[1:43:44] he was receiving it
[1:43:48] the bread he was receiving had come
[1:43:50] from heaven
[1:43:53] it had manifested itself in his presence
[1:43:57] and abraham was eating bread from heaven
[1:44:01] now you i don't want to take time in
[1:44:03] that so let's just move a moment and
[1:44:05] look in john 6 where jesus said i
[1:44:09] am the bread of life
[1:44:11] that comes down
[1:44:14] out of heaven
[1:44:16] so now
[1:44:17] jesus
[1:44:18] is the bread you eat
[1:44:21] where the carcass is
[1:44:22] they're the eagles together
[1:44:25] what you're feeding on is christ
[1:44:28] that's why he says over there in
[1:44:30] revelation come and take the book john
[1:44:33] and eat the book and the word
[1:44:36] of the season
[1:44:38] will be in your mouth john
[1:44:41] you see what he's doing he's feeding on
[1:44:43] the secret revealed word of the age he's
[1:44:47] living in not a new book same book just
[1:44:50] being revealed he's having communion and
[1:44:53] receiving
[1:44:54] of unleavened bread
[1:44:57] it's one of the most beautiful pictures
[1:44:58] in the scripture is that john john here
[1:45:01] is receiving
[1:45:03] unleavened bread called the book
[1:45:06] but it's unleavened bread now if you if
[1:45:08] you if you like to study the message and
[1:45:10] follow the
[1:45:11] follow the path of how god descending
[1:45:15] into into manna for our age you can
[1:45:18] follow the power and show you the very
[1:45:19] trail he takes when brother brown
[1:45:21] preaches a message called paradox how
[1:45:24] many remembers paradox when brother of
[1:45:25] them sees the vision
[1:45:26] of the mamba and he sees the vision of
[1:45:29] going across the jordan and he said i
[1:45:31] went over the jordan and he said all the
[1:45:33] promises were there
[1:45:35] remember that he said i've seen
[1:45:38] if i'll catch you up on if you don't
[1:45:39] remember he said he's seen a vision and
[1:45:42] he said in this vision he was walking on
[1:45:44] this trail and he said he was walking
[1:45:46] and come up and he said i was in
[1:45:47] two-thirds of the journey was over and
[1:45:49] it was one-third of the journey left
[1:45:51] three pulls now he said it was one-third
[1:45:53] of the journey left and he said on the
[1:45:55] other side of the jordan was the last
[1:45:57] part of the journey he said and that's
[1:45:58] where all those promises were were on
[1:46:01] the other side of the jordan
[1:46:03] and then he comes back and teaches
[1:46:05] joshua parallels ephesians
[1:46:07] and he shows that his ministry is to
[1:46:11] lead the bride
[1:46:12] out of a wilderness journey
[1:46:14] into a land of promise
[1:46:17] to cross over he meant the divide and
[1:46:20] and take us into the promises of god
[1:46:23] well when he shows this happening he
[1:46:26] takes this to the scripture he actually
[1:46:29] goes to the book of corinthians it's
[1:46:30] powerful and he said purge out there for
[1:46:32] the old leaven that you may have a new
[1:46:35] lump and ye are unleavened for christ is
[1:46:38] our passover and his sacrifice for us
[1:46:41] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[1:46:44] old leaven neither with leaven of
[1:46:45] madison wickedness but with 11
[1:46:47] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:46:50] so he was showing us
[1:46:52] that his message was about to produce an
[1:46:56] unleavened bread he was going to be
[1:46:58] bringing now this is real important
[1:47:00] because it would have no humanity in it
[1:47:02] right
[1:47:04] 11 is corruption
[1:47:08] it would have no corruption in it
[1:47:11] it would not be corrupted by human
[1:47:12] thinking
[1:47:14] it would be the same kind of bread that
[1:47:17] melchizedek would have given abraham
[1:47:19] back there in that he didn't take it
[1:47:21] from abraham and eat it
[1:47:23] he produced it
[1:47:25] he brought it from heaven
[1:47:27] the revelation that was being given to
[1:47:29] the church was coming from the angel of
[1:47:32] the lord it wasn't coming from the world
[1:47:35] it wasn't coming from theology it was
[1:47:38] coming from heaven bringing us an
[1:47:41] immortal feast where we could eat the
[1:47:44] bread of immortality now church of the
[1:47:47] living god i know you know the promise
[1:47:49] of this age i know that this bride is
[1:47:52] standing at the very at the very brief
[1:47:56] of the changing of the body
[1:47:58] now we could say that we've been saying
[1:48:00] it but if there ever was a time to say
[1:48:02] it i believe it's today
[1:48:05] with putin sitting there with those
[1:48:07] missiles hanging in the bomb
[1:48:09] they're hanging they're waiting they are
[1:48:11] poking the bear right now
[1:48:13] uh our i i hate to say it but our
[1:48:16] sleepy-eyed president is so blind he's
[1:48:18] poking the bear thinking hey man that he
[1:48:21] ain't going to shoot them missiles and
[1:48:22] he keeps telling them i'm going to shoot
[1:48:24] him but there's a word lane over this
[1:48:26] bride
[1:48:28] that says before the first one ever hits
[1:48:31] america
[1:48:32] we'll be setting in glory
[1:48:37] you're eating the bread
[1:48:40] you're eating the bread think of this
[1:48:43] the last communion
[1:48:45] that moses gave before they left egypt
[1:48:48] they ate that bread and they had their
[1:48:51] staff in their hand and they had their
[1:48:53] shoes on their feet brother they were
[1:48:55] ready to go
[1:48:57] and i'll tell you this we're eating this
[1:48:59] message and we're ready to go we don't
[1:49:02] need to get ready we're ready we're
[1:49:04] ready to go tonight and we're eating the
[1:49:06] bread of our change
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:12] every promise is here now it's in the
[1:49:15] scripture it's it's laying there in the
[1:49:16] scripture where he says that all those
[1:49:18] promises are in there and he says what
[1:49:20] it's doing is putting them in joshua how
[1:49:22] many ever followed the journey of joshua
[1:49:25] through the wilderness and they eat of
[1:49:27] the heavenly manna they eat every day of
[1:49:30] that heavenly manna but when they
[1:49:32] crossed over into jordan
[1:49:34] that manna stopped that had been fallen
[1:49:38] for all of that time and now they were
[1:49:41] turned to eat from the land they were
[1:49:44] living in
[1:49:46] they've been waiting 400 years to get
[1:49:50] into this land
[1:49:51] and now that we're going to
[1:49:54] eat i don't have the ability to tell you
[1:49:57] they were going to eat from the promises
[1:50:01] that have been made to abraham thy seed
[1:50:04] shall sojourn but i will deliver them
[1:50:06] and bring them into this land and now
[1:50:09] after 400 years
[1:50:10] they were putting things in their mouth
[1:50:13] that had took 400 years for them to
[1:50:16] taste they were eating things that gave
[1:50:19] them a reality this is my home this is
[1:50:23] my property this is my land this doesn't
[1:50:26] belong to somebody else i have come to
[1:50:28] this time god has brought me to this day
[1:50:31] this is my season this is my message
[1:50:33] this is my hour and when they begin to
[1:50:36] eat that you know the story joshua got
[1:50:38] all kinds of aggressive
[1:50:41] joshua got aggressive he got an attitude
[1:50:44] and decided he'd tear down every
[1:50:45] stronghold and all of all of all of
[1:50:48] palestine he went and started with
[1:50:50] jericho the very day of the passover
[1:50:53] y'all know what passover is it's new
[1:50:55] beginnings
[1:50:57] and he had a new beginning he had a
[1:51:00] refreshing from the presence of god
[1:51:03] while he ate from the land of canaan
[1:51:05] something struck his heart no devil
[1:51:08] gonna keep me off of my ground no more
[1:51:11] no devil gonna keep me out of my
[1:51:12] promises no more
[1:51:14] i'm gonna eat a bread that lets me know
[1:51:17] who i am
[1:51:19] where i come from where i'm going that
[1:51:22] this is the present hour and season and
[1:51:24] i can have this and as he was eating
[1:51:26] this bread look what he's doing he's
[1:51:27] taking from the promise
[1:51:34] am i carrying you are you seeing my
[1:51:36] point he's eating
[1:51:38] he's eating from the promise
[1:51:40] the book has not been promised to be
[1:51:42] open in any other age
[1:51:45] they've been waiting for this book to be
[1:51:47] opened for 6 000 years no man has ate of
[1:51:52] this book and all of a sudden the
[1:51:55] revelation that eve turned down in the
[1:51:58] garden of eden has been brought back to
[1:52:00] the church of the living god and here's
[1:52:03] such a simple group of people tonight
[1:52:06] feeding on the same exact manna the eve
[1:52:10] would have ate in the garden of eden and
[1:52:12] she would have manifested jesus christ
[1:52:15] in the flesh had she continued to eat
[1:52:17] i'll tell you this while we're eating
[1:52:19] this bread
[1:52:21] we're bringing
[1:52:22] we're bringing from the that's why now
[1:52:24] watch this that's why that the baptist
[1:52:27] will tell you a baptist story and
[1:52:29] they'll talk about future days and the
[1:52:31] church of christ about other days but
[1:52:33] when you're listening to a message
[1:52:34] preacher
[1:52:36] they're talking about well the brother
[1:52:37] brahm did this and he opened up this
[1:52:38] channel and this thing happened this
[1:52:40] because that's where you are supposed to
[1:52:43] be feeding
[1:52:45] you're feeding from that word that is
[1:52:48] the word of change
[1:52:50] it's the word for your body change now
[1:52:52] watch this because as you're eating from
[1:52:55] it you begin to live from the evidence
[1:52:58] of your land
[1:53:02] you know i got on the elevator today
[1:53:04] with a guy and he had a youtube on he's
[1:53:06] playing audible audible books i know
[1:53:07] what they are he was playing audible
[1:53:09] books i got on and i could hear he's
[1:53:11] listening to some kind of novel i said
[1:53:14] audible books or why he said oh yeah he
[1:53:16] said i traveled for a living he said man
[1:53:18] i live on these things
[1:53:23] oh my
[1:53:24] you're living on that some fantasy
[1:53:27] some story
[1:53:29] i'm living on something else
[1:53:33] i'm living on what god sent to this age
[1:53:36] to change things
[1:53:38] and look at this it's the thing that god
[1:53:40] is giving that we're not feeding on some
[1:53:42] man
[1:53:43] we're feeding on the word body
[1:53:49] now
[1:53:50] i'm not asking this because i think
[1:53:51] you're slow i think i'm a bad preacher
[1:53:53] are we together
[1:53:54] to this point
[1:53:56] the i am
[1:53:57] present truth
[1:53:59] feeding from that word
[1:54:01] now
[1:54:03] paul says this in hebrews 13.
[1:54:06] he said jesus christ is the same
[1:54:10] yesterday
[1:54:12] today
[1:54:13] and forever
[1:54:15] watch this next verse
[1:54:16] be not carried about with divers and
[1:54:18] strange doctrines
[1:54:20] for it is good thing that the heart be
[1:54:22] established with grace not with meats
[1:54:25] which have not profited them
[1:54:29] that have been occupied therein
[1:54:34] paul's saying it straight ain't he
[1:54:36] some of y'all eating stuff it ain't
[1:54:37] profiting you nothing
[1:54:40] you have been occupied eating things
[1:54:43] that did not fit into jesus christ the
[1:54:46] same yesterday today and forever look
[1:54:49] what his next verse says we have an
[1:54:52] altar
[1:54:53] paul said i got an altar whereof they
[1:54:56] have no
[1:54:57] right to eat in other words they could
[1:55:00] not perceive or receive jesus christ the
[1:55:04] same yesterday today and forever they
[1:55:06] couldn't they couldn't accept that paul
[1:55:08] had met him in the light they couldn't
[1:55:10] swallow it they could not desire the
[1:55:12] idea that that jesus was alive and it
[1:55:15] was they couldn't take the idea of it
[1:55:17] but you see what it is paul is saying
[1:55:19] that he's the same and we have an altar
[1:55:22] that they cannot eat of now y'all know
[1:55:23] that's a good deep subject i don't have
[1:55:25] time to preach tonight but watch in the
[1:55:27] book of psalms david will say this for
[1:55:29] thou preparest the table before me
[1:55:34] in the presence of mine enemies
[1:55:38] thou anointest my head with all and my
[1:55:41] cup runneth over listen god has prepared
[1:55:45] this table
[1:55:47] he has set this banqueting table
[1:55:50] in the presence of your enemy
[1:55:53] the devil is here in all of his power
[1:55:56] the devil brother branham announces the
[1:55:58] god of this age
[1:55:59] he's announced that hell that lead has
[1:56:02] been taken off and 200 000 000 demons
[1:56:05] have rolled in ecclesiastical devils to
[1:56:07] persecute this bride to push against
[1:56:10] them and here we're setting tonight
[1:56:12] eating the food of the manna of almighty
[1:56:16] god the devil might be sitting right by
[1:56:19] you but you're feasting on the food of
[1:56:22] almighty god you're eating word
[1:56:25] you're eating words that will change
[1:56:27] your life in the presence of your enemy
[1:56:31] i will prepare a table for you in the
[1:56:33] presence of your enemy he actually says
[1:56:35] to you he actually says this amen that
[1:56:38] light shines in darkness and darkness
[1:56:40] don't get it
[1:56:43] light shine and darkness don't get it
[1:56:45] what are you talking about brother wade
[1:56:47] i'll say this to you amen the message
[1:56:50] reveals
[1:56:51] christ and the world didn't see it when
[1:56:52] it happened
[1:56:54] it revealed christ and they didn't see
[1:56:56] it when it happened because he's
[1:56:58] revealing scripture that they look at
[1:57:02] it's summer's way in the future do you
[1:57:04] know first thessalonians the fourth
[1:57:05] chapter is in the middle of being
[1:57:08] manifested here tonight do you know that
[1:57:11] the very scripture the lord himself
[1:57:13] should descend from heaven with a shout
[1:57:15] and a voice and a trump that child is
[1:57:17] the message of william branham
[1:57:20] brother random said the living bread
[1:57:23] the living bread when you're feeding on
[1:57:27] the message you are becoming the voice
[1:57:30] of the resurrection
[1:57:32] the words that have been given to you
[1:57:35] are the very words of resurrection power
[1:57:38] they're the words that could change your
[1:57:39] bodies first corinthians 15 he said i'll
[1:57:42] show you a mystery we'll not all sleep
[1:57:44] but we shall be changed
[1:57:46] that in a moment of the twinkling of eye
[1:57:48] the last trump the trumpet shall sound
[1:57:50] the dead shall be raised in corruption
[1:57:51] we shall be changed for this corruptible
[1:57:54] must put on incorruption
[1:57:57] and this mortal
[1:57:59] must put on immortality
[1:58:01] and how you going to do that
[1:58:05] how are you going to do that
[1:58:07] how are you going to get in corruption
[1:58:10] in a corruptable state
[1:58:12] how
[1:58:14] are you going to take in
[1:58:17] something that is incorruptible
[1:58:19] when you are completely corruptable
[1:58:22] brother biscuit said something one time
[1:58:24] i thought was phenomenal
[1:58:26] he said you're judging a church trying
[1:58:28] to make up what you think about it but
[1:58:31] you are in such an unperfect condition
[1:58:33] how could you ever give a perfect
[1:58:34] judgment
[1:58:38] so no matter how
[1:58:40] how wonderful you think that you could
[1:58:42] approach the scripture you'll never
[1:58:44] approach them incorruptibly
[1:58:47] because you're so corrupted
[1:58:50] right
[1:58:51] but look at what he's saying you would
[1:58:53] take it on
[1:58:55] the church
[1:58:56] eats the message of the hour
[1:59:00] the message of this hour is the rapture
[1:59:06] the message of this day is the change of
[1:59:10] your body
[1:59:12] the promise of this hour the i am of
[1:59:15] this day is the lord shall descend from
[1:59:19] heaven with a shout and the voice what
[1:59:22] are you doing here
[1:59:23] the rapture has sent you here
[1:59:28] church i i i don't believe this bible is
[1:59:32] written separate from somebody i believe
[1:59:34] somebody is first thessalonians 4. i'm
[1:59:38] not just reading about the rapture i am
[1:59:40] the rapture i'm not just reading the
[1:59:42] bible we are the bible we're not just
[1:59:45] reading the message we are the message
[1:59:48] you don't think god's going to take home
[1:59:50] a book do you he's going to take home a
[1:59:52] bride who has ate the book became the
[1:59:55] book and he's going to take that book
[1:59:57] it's a change of the body it's it's what
[2:00:00] god is giving to change the church
[2:00:03] now look what he's doing when he begins
[2:00:05] to bring that bread he's bringing a
[2:00:07] feast
[2:00:10] he's inviting you to a feast
[2:00:13] now you i read it for you first
[2:00:15] corinthians 15 he actually says this
[2:00:18] corruptible shall put on an
[2:00:19] incorruptible and put on immortality and
[2:00:21] when it happens he says it shall be
[2:00:23] brought to pass saying death
[2:00:25] is swaddled up
[2:00:27] death is swallowed up
[2:00:31] in victory
[2:00:34] now watch this
[2:00:35] in isaiah 25 and 80s that death will be
[2:00:38] swallowed up in victory your enemy
[2:00:40] will be eaten by victory
[2:00:45] faith
[2:00:46] is
[2:00:48] your victory
[2:00:51] here at the time
[2:00:53] of the destruction of your enemy
[2:00:57] the bible said god sets up a banquet
[2:01:01] now can you imagine this
[2:01:03] that he sets a table
[2:01:05] with fats and wines and invite you
[2:01:10] to a banquet of wine
[2:01:14] the bride of christ
[2:01:15] the mount zion
[2:01:17] there is something that he is preparing
[2:01:19] he's preparing he's preparing a table of
[2:01:22] wine
[2:01:23] now what what you're coming to
[2:01:25] is the refreshment of god
[2:01:28] what you're eating is a refreshment of
[2:01:30] god it literally is a wine that is to be
[2:01:34] given now you're all bible students
[2:01:35] you're message believers so i'm not
[2:01:36] going to preach a long sermon here but
[2:01:38] watch what he's saying in revelation six
[2:01:40] and six
[2:01:41] brother branham is
[2:01:42] distinct in telling you this
[2:01:45] he says the bible says in the third seal
[2:01:49] in the middle of the dark ages
[2:01:51] hurt not
[2:01:53] the oil and the wine
[2:01:56] he said now we're going to find the
[2:01:58] symbol for oil means the holy ghost
[2:02:03] it's god he said but now that symbol for
[2:02:06] wine
[2:02:07] represents revelation
[2:02:10] now watch the the banquet he's inviting
[2:02:13] you to
[2:02:14] is a banquet of revelation
[2:02:17] he's showing you that what's going to
[2:02:20] overcome your enemy is revelation
[2:02:23] the church that takes the revelation of
[2:02:26] the age will be overcomers in that age
[2:02:30] if you receive the revelation you
[2:02:32] receive strength to overcome can i can i
[2:02:34] just give you the scripture when the
[2:02:36] enemy comes like a flood
[2:02:39] god will raise a standard against that
[2:02:41] enemy
[2:02:42] come on y'all know the scripture and
[2:02:44] there was a line and there was a man and
[2:02:46] there was an ox and there's an eagle and
[2:02:49] the prophet said the eagle was the one
[2:02:51] that would defeat in the last days and
[2:02:54] what is it eagle is a word prophet
[2:02:56] giving revelation to the church so the
[2:03:00] banquet of the bride is a banquet of

[2:03:26] will kill the doubt that is doubting the
[2:03:28] word

[2:03:33] doubting spirit is revelation the way

[2:03:41] revelation the gates of hell will never
[2:03:44] prevail against revelation when this
[2:03:47] bride recognizes who she is then the
[2:03:50] rapture's going to go the rapture is a
[2:03:53] revelation
[2:03:56] oh
[2:03:57] glory to god it's when the church begins
[2:04:00] to drink of the wine of the revelation
[2:04:02] of almighty god
[2:04:03] who's set out there
[2:04:06] at a table i i tell you it's it's an
[2:04:08] amazing study it's an amazing study to
[2:04:11] see that this is exactly what happens
[2:04:14] when
[2:04:15] this is exactly what happens when esther
[2:04:19] wants to get rid of her enemy
[2:04:23] you remember what it was when esther
[2:04:25] wanted to get rid of her enemy what she
[2:04:26] done is she got into a position
[2:04:29] that she was a queen
[2:04:31] but it was a secret that she was the
[2:04:33] seed of abraham
[2:04:35] she was a queen but it was a secret of
[2:04:38] who she really was y'all remember that
[2:04:40] she got in under cover then the seventh
[2:04:42] seal had never been opened yet but she
[2:04:45] was in position as queen without anybody
[2:04:47] knowing who really she was and haman
[2:04:50] decided i'll kill all them jews but he
[2:04:53] didn't realize that the very jew seed he
[2:04:56] was trying to kill was now the queen of
[2:04:58] the country he was living in
[2:05:01] he didn't know that god had elevated the
[2:05:03] seed and hid it in the palace and she
[2:05:07] was setting in royalty while the enemy
[2:05:10] was trying to kill her thinking she was
[2:05:12] just another no-good-for-nothing jew but
[2:05:15] she was the seed of abraham you know
[2:05:18] what she did hey man she outsmarted that
[2:05:20] devil because mordecai sent word to her
[2:05:23] that she needed to do something and you
[2:05:25] remember she didn't want to at first
[2:05:26] remember she said no i don't think this
[2:05:28] is going to work i don't think this is
[2:05:30] going to work and this is where the
[2:05:31] revelation came to me you got to get up
[2:05:34] before you can get down
[2:05:36] you've got to get up sometimes before
[2:05:38] you can get down to business with god
[2:05:40] you got to get up and start believing
[2:05:43] esther could not believe she could
[2:05:45] conquer her enemy but mordecai convinced
[2:05:48] her that she needed to do something so
[2:05:50] when she got lifted up high enough she
[2:05:53] got down to business with god and began
[2:05:56] a three-day fashion remember that and on
[2:05:58] the third day
[2:05:59] she went in i ain't trying to preach it
[2:06:03] i just want you to pick up the thought
[2:06:04] on the third day she went in and when
[2:06:06] she did she was offered a golden scepter
[2:06:10] come on now take the authority it's
[2:06:13] going to be offered to you and it
[2:06:15] happens in the third day
[2:06:17] does that mean anything to y'all in the
[2:06:19] third day you're gonna get this golden
[2:06:22] scepter and it'll give you authority of
[2:06:25] half of this kingdom and she could have
[2:06:28] asked for anything she wanted she could
[2:06:30] have in this day she could have a joint
[2:06:33] airship with him and ask for anything
[2:06:35] she wanted you know what she wanted she
[2:06:37] wanted rid of that enemy
[2:06:39] and how could she get rid of that enemy
[2:06:42] she made a banquet of wine
[2:06:45] and she invited her enemy with her
[2:06:47] husband king at the same time
[2:06:50] and under that banquet of wine there
[2:06:54] came out a revelation that somebody was
[2:06:57] trying to kill her and it was this very
[2:06:59] haman that was there and that she was
[2:07:02] the seed of abraham and the king seeing
[2:07:06] this oh god he literally had haman had
[2:07:09] had a had a hood put over his head and
[2:07:12] drug him out because he was trying to
[2:07:15] abuse the queen in the presence of his
[2:07:18] own cousin or her own king and to think
[2:07:20] here we are tonight that this devil has
[2:07:23] to come right here in the house of god
[2:07:26] and he's approached with us in this
[2:07:28] banquet of wine but let me tell that
[2:07:30] devil something the seventh seal's
[2:07:32] already revealed it we are the seed of
[2:07:34] abraham we are the royal queen seed of
[2:07:37] almighty god and as the revelation
[2:07:40] begins to unfold
[2:07:44] amen that devil's already whipped
[2:07:46] tonight whether he knows it or not god
[2:07:49] has given grace to this bride to
[2:07:50] overcome that devil
[2:07:54] it's a banquet of wine that you're
[2:07:56] drinking the wine and the stimulation of
[2:07:58] the rabbit do you see that as you good
[2:08:00] in revelation it's going to grow now in
[2:08:03] it and when you start looking into this
[2:08:05] i've got just a couple minutes and i'll
[2:08:07] close when when you start getting into
[2:08:09] this and you go and look at jesus
[2:08:12] this is beautiful because this is the
[2:08:14] very first miracle he ever performs
[2:08:19] the very first miracle he ever performs
[2:08:22] is in john the second chapter
[2:08:25] now if you read it uh if you read it
[2:08:28] there with me it's a powerful reading
[2:08:30] i don't have time to go through all of
[2:08:32] it but i want to read it with you just a
[2:08:33] little bit but pull up john the second
[2:08:35] chapter and when's the last time you
[2:08:37] read this portion it's it's a powerful
[2:08:39] read
[2:08:40] the bible said
[2:08:42] that the third day
[2:08:45] there was a marriage in canaan galilee
[2:08:47] the mother of jesus was there
[2:08:51] now did that say the third day
[2:08:53] it said the third day
[2:08:56] do you know the third day y'all know how
[2:08:58] important that day is
[2:08:59] it's actually a tuesday right the third
[2:09:01] day's a tuesday but jews got married on
[2:09:03] the third day because in the beginning
[2:09:05] when god created the heavens and earth
[2:09:06] it was twice he said it's good on the
[2:09:08] third day it's good it's good so they
[2:09:11] said it's a good day and they got
[2:09:13] married on the third day which were
[2:09:15] tuesdays
[2:09:16] but in matthew the 24th chapter
[2:09:18] it was on a tuesday in the evening time
[2:09:21] when jesus answered three questions that
[2:09:25] had been asked to him about the sign of
[2:09:27] the times amen when shall these things
[2:09:29] be and what shall be the sign of thy
[2:09:31] coming it was in the evening of the
[2:09:32] third day when he answered all of the
[2:09:35] questions
[2:09:37] when the six seals were put in matthew
[2:09:40] 24 was in the evening of the third day
[2:09:43] do you see us the same in this last day
[2:09:46] brother branham said the third day
[2:09:48] remember jesus rose on the third day
[2:09:51] and in the morning of the third day they
[2:09:54] had some rumors he was alive
[2:09:58] but in the evening of the third day they
[2:10:01] saw him break bread and knew it was him
[2:10:05] he broke bread in the evening of the
[2:10:07] third day and under a banquet in a
[2:10:10] little room he revealed that this is the
[2:10:12] same jesus he is resurrected from the
[2:10:16] grave
[2:10:17] i tell you god has given us a little
[2:10:20] room experience today he took us in in
[2:10:23] the evening of the third day and broke
[2:10:25] the bread and we have seen jesus the
[2:10:28] same thing
[2:10:32] it's in the third day he comes to this
[2:10:34] wedding
[2:10:37] it's a beautiful thing that happens in
[2:10:39] canaan galilee the mother of jesus is
[2:10:41] there and both jesus was called and his
[2:10:43] disciples to the marriage and when they
[2:10:46] wanted wine
[2:10:48] the mother of jesus said unto him
[2:10:51] they have no wine
[2:10:56] brother
[2:10:57] oh marriage without wine
[2:11:03] a marriage in the evening of the third
[2:11:06] day
[2:11:07] without
[2:11:08] wine now you can listen to a different
[2:11:11] translation that's pretty powerful when
[2:11:12] you read the king james version the new
[2:11:14] king james version they said it in a way
[2:11:16] it helps you catch it just a little
[2:11:18] better
[2:11:18] it said and when they ran out of wine
[2:11:24] you mean
[2:11:25] they started with some wine
[2:11:28] but when they ran out
[2:11:31] when they ran
[2:11:33] out of wine
[2:11:35] i tell you
[2:11:36] friends
[2:11:39] when they ran out
[2:11:41] jesus was there
[2:11:45] they ran out of wine
[2:11:48] but when they ran out so happened it
[2:11:52] happened at the same time jesus had
[2:11:55] entered the marriage
[2:11:57] when they ran out of wine you said
[2:11:58] preacher what are you talking about can
[2:12:00] i can i just tell you this
[2:12:02] there are a lot of times in scripture
[2:12:04] people ran out
[2:12:05] but when they ran out he was there
[2:12:09] let me ask you about this about about
[2:12:11] that with a zero path when she ran out
[2:12:13] of bread
[2:12:15] what about she had bread but she had run
[2:12:18] out of bread and when she ran out and
[2:12:21] elisha was there and said if you'll make
[2:12:24] some bread for me you won't never run
[2:12:27] out no more
[2:12:29] because when you run out is when god
[2:12:33] gets busy
[2:12:34] restoring what you have lost this is the
[2:12:37] age of restitution when the world run
[2:12:41] out of revelation here is jesus giving

[2:13:09] you needs a little cause when you're
[2:13:11] just about ouch it's when god can cause
[2:13:13] miracles to happen amen it's when god
[2:13:16] can do great things with little things
[2:13:18] brother
[2:13:20] he said go borrow some go borrow you
[2:13:22] some vessels and they went and borrowed
[2:13:24] vessels amen and you know what they did
[2:13:26] they found out that god could fill every

[2:13:57] i'm sitting here thinking about people
[2:13:58] that ran out i thought my goodness what
[2:14:00] about moses he ran out of a place to go
[2:14:04] when he ran out of a place to go god
[2:14:06] made him a place to go

[2:14:25] and there's a feast of wine where god is
[2:14:28] refilling the barrel every morning
[2:14:35] when you run out there's a god to refill

[2:14:57] mountains on one side and the other put
[2:14:59] a sea in front of him put an army behind
[2:15:01] him so he would have no place to go
[2:15:05] he said because god wanted to show us
[2:15:08] that when there is no way he will make a
[2:15:11] way
[2:15:12] when there is no way he will make a way
[2:15:15] let me prophesy to you full gospel amen

[2:15:56] when he run out told him you just speak
[2:15:58] the word

[2:16:02] said there'll be some light son you
[2:16:04] stand still moon you stand still and he
[2:16:07] fought the battle brother let me ask you
[2:16:09] something when did joshua pray about
[2:16:11] that
[2:16:14] brother branham said joshua never even
[2:16:15] prayed through about it he said god had
[2:16:18] already prayed him through before the
[2:16:20] foundation of the world and he was
[2:16:22] standing there in the line of duty and
[2:16:26] god gave him what he needed in that hour
[2:16:29] i'll tell you this you may be out
[2:16:30] tonight but god get a word in your mouth
[2:16:33] and if you will let your mouth open up

[2:16:49] martha run out of time four days four
[2:16:51] days lasers had laid in that grave she
[2:16:54] was out of time it was over corruption
[2:16:56] already set in the body but while she
[2:16:59] was seeing him laying there and all out
[2:17:02] of time the bible said jesus came and
[2:17:05] she went out to meet him and said lord
[2:17:08] if you would have been here i wouldn't
[2:17:10] have run out he said martha even now
[2:17:13] i am the resurrection and the life and
[2:17:16] though he were dead yet shall he live
[2:17:18] listen church he's still the i am
[2:17:22] he run out
[2:17:25] come on jeribus brother brown taught us
[2:17:27] something about drives he said he ran
[2:17:28] out of hope
[2:17:30] everyone i hope
[2:17:32] you'll run a little hope you're just
[2:17:33] running out of hope
[2:17:34] brother brown said he ran i hope he said
[2:17:36] you know why
[2:17:37] he said he ran out of hope because they
[2:17:38] had already
[2:17:40] embalmed his daughter
[2:17:43] he said by the time jesus had got to
[2:17:45] driver's house they had pulled the blood
[2:17:48] out and had put had put something in her
[2:17:51] to preserve her he said the same way
[2:17:53] that that denomination has done you
[2:17:57] he said they pulled out the life and
[2:17:59] have and they he said they have they
[2:18:01] have put that stuff in you to preserve
[2:18:04] you and keep you dead
[2:18:09] but when jesus came
[2:18:12] he said clear the room of all the
[2:18:14] unbelievers clear the room of all the
[2:18:16] make-believers you're about to see a
[2:18:18] resurrection because when you run out of
[2:18:20] hope jesus is still the great i am
[2:18:26] when you run out
[2:18:28] when you run out
[2:18:31] they were out
[2:18:32] but jesus was there
[2:18:34] you know what he says he said under her
[2:18:37] woman what have i to do with thee
[2:18:40] mine hours not yet come and his mother
[2:18:42] said unto his servants whatsoever he
[2:18:44] saith unto you
[2:18:47] just do it
[2:18:50] she never even discussed
[2:18:53] whether or not he was going to
[2:18:56] he said now when he tells you to do
[2:18:57] something just go ahead and do it
[2:18:58] because we're about to have wine
[2:19:00] whatever he tells you
[2:19:02] can you imagine
[2:19:04] when they looked over there the
[2:19:05] scripture says there were six water pots
[2:19:07] of stone
[2:19:09] and they had three ferkins a piece now
[2:19:12] that means about 20 or 30 gallon
[2:19:15] containers were sitting there
[2:19:18] and jesus commanded them that they would
[2:19:20] fill those water pots
[2:19:22] so there's about a hundred and eighty
[2:19:24] gallons of water
[2:19:27] and me and me and isaac was reading this
[2:19:29] just before church
[2:19:30] i tell you what about about sent me into
[2:19:33] overdrive
[2:19:34] the bible said and he said unto them
[2:19:37] draw out now and bear it unto the
[2:19:40] governor of the feast and they bear it
[2:19:43] and when the ruler of the feast had
[2:19:45] tasted means experienced when he had
[2:19:48] tasted the water
[2:19:50] that was made wine
[2:19:52] he knew
[2:19:53] not whence it was
[2:19:55] but the servants which drew the water
[2:19:58] knew
[2:20:02] i don't know how it happened
[2:20:04] but somewhere
[2:20:06] from the time that that boy
[2:20:09] filled that cup up with water
[2:20:12] when he filled the water it was water
[2:20:17] and somewhere
[2:20:19] before he could give that water
[2:20:22] to the governor
[2:20:23] it had already turned wine
[2:20:28] now let me see
[2:20:30] acts the second chapter and
[2:20:32] yeah acts 3 20 and 219. yeah malachi 4
[2:20:37] yeah joel chapter 2.
[2:20:42] they knew not
[2:20:45] that it was just water
[2:20:48] but the servant that drew it knew
[2:20:52] it was water
[2:20:54] but it's been turned
[2:20:56] into wine
[2:20:59] it was just scripture friends
[2:21:03] it was just the water of the word
[2:21:06] it was just scripture
[2:21:11] but the master said why
[2:21:14] why is it
[2:21:15] that you have saved this last wine
[2:21:19] why is it the best
[2:21:22] most people wait
[2:21:24] serve the good wine in the front get
[2:21:25] everybody drunk and then they
[2:21:27] then they serve the bad wine
[2:21:31] but not jesus
[2:21:35] he saves the best wine
[2:21:38] he saves that stimulating wine
[2:21:42] for the last days
[2:21:45] it's then that he will take and reveal
[2:21:48] that when jesus turned water into wine
[2:21:51] he was showing that one day
[2:21:54] i'm going to change your body
[2:21:57] and i'm going to bypass your parents to
[2:21:59] do it
[2:22:01] i'm not going to bring you through the
[2:22:03] process
[2:22:04] i'm just going to speak and you're going
[2:22:06] to be changed
[2:22:08] listen tonight friends
[2:22:10] i believe
[2:22:12] that we're drinking some good wine
[2:22:17] at the banquets
[2:22:19] of wine
[2:22:20] do you stand your feet with us tonight
[2:22:24] at the banquets
[2:22:27] of wine
[2:22:33] sometimes
[2:22:40] sometimes you have a real enemy
[2:22:44] you say how do i destroy this enemy
[2:22:49] invite him to the banquet
[2:22:53] me and brother
[2:22:55] me and brother timothy pruitt was down
[2:22:57] there working on this on his church
[2:23:00] back several years back and
[2:23:02] summertime we walked up through there
[2:23:04] doing something looked over
[2:23:06] there's a big rattlesnake laying there
[2:23:08] on the sidewalk
[2:23:11] i don't know if me and timothy one
[2:23:13] killed him we killed the snake either
[2:23:14] way
[2:23:17] i looked over the snake and i said you
[2:23:18] come here to die
[2:23:24] sometimes
[2:23:26] your enemy would like to keep you out of
[2:23:28] the house of god
[2:23:32] not keep you away from this banquet
[2:23:35] but if you just invite him
[2:23:38] this is where he's destroyed
[2:23:43] this is where he's this is where he's
[2:23:44] done away with
[2:23:47] and when the revelation begins to come
[2:23:49] this is the
[2:23:50] this is the thing
[2:23:52] that the message is producing
[2:23:55] is a refreshing
[2:23:58] a renewal
[2:24:01] he is the same
[2:24:04] yesterday today and forever
[2:24:07] if you're sitting here tonight you say
[2:24:09] by the way
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:12] i'm just at a place in my life
[2:24:15] where i just need my joy back
[2:24:19] when you're at a banquet
[2:24:23] and all you need to do is begin to drink
[2:24:28] if you start drinking this wine i'm
[2:24:29] talking about after a while
[2:24:33] it starts stimulating
[2:24:36] you start moving
[2:24:38] i don't think i'm the only one preaches
[2:24:39] on why jesus preached him
[2:24:42] and he said you can't take this new wine
[2:24:46] and put it in an old bottle
[2:24:48] [Music]
[2:24:50] brother brown said the revelation behind
[2:24:52] it is
[2:24:54] he said the new wine has a little life
[2:24:56] in it
[2:24:57] and it's still got some movement
[2:25:00] so that's why you got to have some oil
[2:25:03] is you got to oil these old human bodies
[2:25:07] you got to oil that skin down that when
[2:25:10] you put the wine in it there's some
[2:25:11] flexibility in it
[2:25:14] there's some movement hey longer we're
[2:25:16] around the church if we're not careful
[2:25:17] to stiffer we get
[2:25:19] but we need to take some oil and wipe
[2:25:21] all over us
[2:25:23] make us flexible again
[2:25:25] make us move again you know what brother
[2:25:27] brown said he said it'll give the wine
[2:25:30] room
[2:25:30] [Music]
[2:25:32] when's the last time you give the wine
[2:25:34] some room
[2:25:36] when's the last time you made a little
[2:25:37] room for the wine
[2:25:39] make it where it can move in you just a
[2:25:41] little bit
[2:25:42] you had to tell your neighbor screwed
[2:25:43] over a little neighbor
[2:25:45] screwed over a little i'm about to i'm
[2:25:47] about to shout right here in this
[2:25:48] meeting tonight
[2:25:50] said preacher you wouldn't do that
[2:25:51] absolutely i would
[2:25:53] i said make a little room for the wine
[2:25:55] there's something moving on the inside
[2:25:57] of my heart
[2:25:58] i want to feel the grace of god i i
[2:26:00] don't want no dry religion
[2:26:03] i want stiff religion
[2:26:05] i don't want no tied down intellectual
[2:26:07] concept of what the word of god is we
[2:26:10] want something that lives
[2:26:12] something that moves our hearts
[2:26:14] something that changes our lives
[2:26:17] so probably not i got this enemy that's
[2:26:19] it's just plaguing me everywhere
[2:26:21] bringing to the banquet tonight
[2:26:24] turn the wine bottle up begin to drink
[2:26:27] the revelation that tells you i come
[2:26:29] from god i'm going back to god i'm
[2:26:32] ordained before the foundation of the
[2:26:34] world the word has come to me and the
[2:26:37] bride of christ i'm the seed of abraham

[2:27:09] you put it in your vision and you begin
[2:27:11] to thank him for it
[2:27:13] and you begin to worship him for it
