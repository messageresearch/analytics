[44:17] yeah

[44:22] interesting thought today
[44:24] i i think you'll enjoy just the title of
[44:26] it
[44:28] and i'd like to
[44:30] call satan's name by by
[44:33] just pointing him out real quick
[44:36] satan
[44:39] has underestimated you
[44:42] [Music]
[44:46] got a smile just at the title
[44:49] he has underestimated you
[44:54] i'd like to ask him have you forgot who
[44:55] you're fooling with here
[45:00] i had an experience one time where they
[45:03] had told me that i was paralyzed and
[45:05] would be that way the rest of my life
[45:08] and i looked up from that bed and i said
[45:10] you don't know who you're talking to
[45:14] there was a fire that took place in my
[45:16] life and they were going to harvest my
[45:19] organs
[45:20] and they had come to a decision we're
[45:22] going to do it at such and such a time
[45:25] but five hours before
[45:27] they were to harvest my organs
[45:29] i woke up
[45:31] i still had need of that
[45:34] now i face cancer
[45:37] and they gave me four months
[45:39] two and a half years ago
[45:44] so i guess i can can as a minister stand
[45:48] here and preach this sermon
[45:50] satan
[45:52] you underestimated us
[46:06] second corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[46:08] 3 this morning
[46:12] ii corinthians chapter 10
[46:14] and verse 3
[46:17] for though that we walk in the flesh
[46:20] we do not war after the flesh
[46:23] for the weapons of our warfire are not
[46:26] carnal but mighty through god to the
[46:28] pulling down of strongholds
[46:31] casting down imaginations and every high
[46:35] thing that exalteth
[46:36] itself against the knowledge of god
[46:39] bringing into captivity every thought
[46:44] to the obedience of christ you might
[46:46] have a need this morning you'd just like
[46:48] to say lord would you remember me today
[46:51] let's just pray father you see our hands
[46:54] up this morning you know our needs
[46:56] you know before we even think it or we
[46:58] even ask it but you taught us to ask
[47:02] that we might receive you taught us to
[47:04] believe and we do and now we stand in
[47:08] this atmosphere of expectation that all
[47:11] things are possible now today anoint us
[47:14] like never before inspire us
[47:17] lord strengthen us for the journey that
[47:19] lays ahead father refill us with the
[47:22] holy spirit lord let us not lay on
[47:25] yesterday's experience or 10 years ago
[47:28] but may it be fresh may it be
[47:31] fruitful in our lives dear god we pray
[47:34] in jesus christ's name we ask a man a
[47:38] man and a man and a man
[47:40] amen you can be seated
[47:43] i'd like to announce to you that we have
[47:45] a champion
[47:48] our champion's not
[47:50] has never lost a war
[47:58] our champion has never lost a war
[48:01] he's never lost a battle
[48:04] satan would have to even testify that
[48:06] our champion has whipped him every time
[48:11] he's never been in crisis
[48:14] he never has a stress meeting in heaven
[48:19] and what he promises will come to truth
[48:23] he's not a political scientist he's not
[48:25] just wondering if it will happen he's
[48:28] wrote the book
[48:33] and if you ever was the thought of god
[48:35] god will never forget you
[48:38] that's a good basis a star didn't it
[48:41] but we get our mind on what men think or
[48:44] what our feelings think or what others
[48:46] think about us all of those things don't
[48:49] matter
[48:54] let's just look at what really matters
[48:58] what other people think of me don't
[49:00] matter
[49:01] what you think about yourself really
[49:03] don't matter but it's what god thinks
[49:06] about me
[49:07] [Applause]
[49:11] it such as two opponents in a boxing
[49:13] ring
[49:16] they both are testing each other's
[49:18] strengths and
[49:19] each other's abilities
[49:22] now let me just lay it like this
[49:24] god created his own enemy
[49:31] god created his own enemy and in
[49:34] creating his own enemy the reason that
[49:36] he did it was to show parts of himself
[49:38] that would never be showed in any other
[49:41] way
[49:42] inside of god there had to he wanted to
[49:45] show that he was a savior
[49:49] so somebody had to be lost
[49:51] he wanted to show that i am a healer
[49:54] i am a writer
[49:58] listen in him he wanted to show that i
[50:00] am the word
[50:02] i am the light
[50:03] so he had to show an enemy
[50:07] that could believe that he could win
[50:11] had to build an enemy that would believe
[50:14] in himself that he could win
[50:16] and god knew he couldn't
[50:20] i like it i like it when you're on the
[50:22] wind inside
[50:24] this is a red court
[50:27] this is a rigged war
[50:30] i don't know if you've understood it yet
[50:32] but you have been invited and put in a
[50:34] war that you will win
[50:38] there will be times that you think i'm
[50:40] not going to make it through but you
[50:42] will win
[50:43] you will get through this
[50:54] there's a contrasting of opposites
[50:56] there's a law of opposites there's two
[50:59] kingdoms of opposites
[51:01] but we realize that we came from god and
[51:04] we're going back to god
[51:06] and you must never
[51:08] never never forget where you came from
[51:14] the scripture says for we wrestle not
[51:16] against flesh and blood but against
[51:18] principalities against powers
[51:21] rules of darkness of this world against
[51:24] spiritual wickedness in high places
[51:26] our prophet would speak to us a contest
[51:29] if you haven't listened to it lately
[51:31] it's a powerful sermon go back and
[51:33] listen to it
[51:34] contest is a strength is a test of
[51:38] strength
[51:41] we
[51:42] have been given the greatest strength
[51:45] that you could possibly
[51:47] ever be given
[51:51] are you with me now
[51:54] remember these simple principles as we
[51:56] would start
[51:58] nothing
[52:00] great
[52:01] has ever been done without persistence
[52:09] there's always some sweat equity in it
[52:16] we serve an infinite god
[52:19] that knows the end from the beginning
[52:25] retreat is never in our vocabulary
[52:31] that must be kind of when when we live
[52:34] in a world where people quit
[52:36] where people burn out
[52:38] where people give up
[52:40] where people don't want to go on any
[52:42] longer where suicide is rampant we as
[52:45] christians sit in churches all across
[52:48] the world under the message of the hour
[52:51] and retreat is never in our vocabulary
[52:59] because we believe that there is nothing
[53:02] impossible with our god now
[53:13] the scripture tells us that fear not
[53:16] fear is real
[53:17] fear is mentioned in the scripture 600
[53:20] times but jesus even the angels would
[53:23] tell brother branham fear not
[53:26] i believe that can be said for me and
[53:28] you today regardless of our
[53:29] circumstances or situations or what the
[53:33] doctors are telling us fear not
[53:36] just keep speaking faith allow the faith
[53:40] worse to go across your lips
[53:46] remember this
[53:47] you're the final frontier
[53:50] as gentile believers you're the final
[53:52] group
[53:54] that will fight an enemy such as we're
[53:55] fighting
[53:57] we're that final group that satan has
[53:59] mustered all of his enemies to get ready
[54:01] to fight against as a matter of fact the
[54:04] river euphrates has been loosened
[54:06] against the bride of jesus christ and
[54:08] all of hell is against the bride of
[54:11] jesus christ and he still don't have
[54:13] enough
[54:16] say it with me and he still don't have
[54:19] enough
[54:21] let's have a participation service and
[54:24] he still don't have enough
[54:26] let's say it like our sister saying it
[54:29] it's gonna take a stronger win than this
[54:37] hallelujah
[54:39] we have been given the right in the word
[54:41] that will defeat the devil anywhere any
[54:44] place at any time
[54:50] the scripture says as a man
[54:54] thinketh
[54:56] in his heart
[54:58] so is he
[55:00] so you must not think what you think
[55:03] you've got to think what god thinks
[55:05] about you
[55:06] you might think you're a shriveled up
[55:08] little nobody but god says you're an
[55:11] overcomer of laodicea that you're an
[55:14] invincible army so i choose to believe
[55:18] god
[55:20] [Applause]
[55:23] whether you're in a lion's den or you've
[55:25] got a six-foot stick in your hand like
[55:27] shamgar had or a stone in a rope you are
[55:32] the winner
[55:33] [Applause]
[55:36] at the end of the day daniel walked out
[55:38] of the lion's den
[55:40] at the end of the day david pulled a
[55:44] giant's head up to the top of the hill
[55:48] at the end of the day schanger stood
[55:51] there with a stick and there wasn't one
[55:54] enemy standing
[55:56] at the end of the day we'll be in a rob
[55:59] trap
[56:13] brother branham said the right mental
[56:14] attitude
[56:24] even in a cancer center they're telling
[56:26] us every day
[56:28] said it's your attitude toward cancer
[56:32] if you believe you're going to lose
[56:33] you're going to lose
[56:36] you're going to lose
[56:38] you get up fearing it every day you're
[56:39] going to lose you get up in a bad
[56:41] attitude every day you're going to lose
[56:43] shake yourself
[56:45] shake yourself
[56:48] get up out of the bed and say what am i
[56:50] going to do today
[56:52] it don't matter what you feel like it
[56:53] don't matter what you think it's what
[56:55] god said and if i've got god's attitude
[56:58] toward the battle that is facing me i'm
[57:01] going to win
[57:03] [Applause]
[57:10] [Music]
[57:13] the scripture says let not your heart be
[57:15] troubled
[57:16] you believe in god believe also in me
[57:22] a lot of people have trouble
[57:24] but they don't know where their source
[57:25] is
[57:27] a lot of people wary
[57:29] but wary is the opposite of faith
[57:32] where it has no virtue in it
[57:35] it has absolutely no strength wary will
[57:39] never fix your problem
[57:42] punch your neighbor and tell him where
[57:44] he will never fix your problem
[57:54] the scripture says count it all joy
[58:02] if the devil's not trying to get you
[58:06] you can finish the sentence
[58:08] if the devil hasn't got you
[58:13] so if he is at war with you counted joy
[58:20] when the enemy arranges to come around
[58:23] you
[58:25] engage him.
[58:31] the enemies are the enemy's fighting
[58:34] engaging
[58:36] send him back to hell
[58:42] don't testify for him
[58:45] so many people testify for him and
[58:48] actually blow his balloon up
[58:52] come on help me church
[58:54] i'm not the only one who wants to have a
[58:56] good time here this morning don't blow
[58:58] the devil's balloon up
[59:00] he is a loser
[59:03] so don't make him feel like a
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:17] oh winner i'm in a lot of circumstances
[59:19] they don't matter
[59:24] never look back
[59:26] the runner that looks back loses
[59:30] the scripture tells us to press towards
[59:32] the mark of the high calling
[59:35] press
[59:37] press say it press
[59:42] now satan's job is to exalt itself
[59:46] it's doubt its reasonings it's his
[59:48] questions
[59:49] about the revealed word of this hour
[59:53] but faith can reach where science
[59:57] can never reach
[1:00:01] it's good to have confidence in your
[1:00:03] good old doctors but faith overrides all
[1:00:06] of their practicing ability because
[1:00:08] they're practicing physicians and our
[1:00:11] god is a perfecting one
[1:00:15] but brother ron i'm under pressure who
[1:00:17] ain't
[1:00:19] who in this building is not under
[1:00:20] pressure our youngest children are under
[1:00:22] pressure
[1:00:24] moms and dads are under pressure
[1:00:28] old people in nursing homes are under
[1:00:30] pressure they ring the bell and nobody
[1:00:33] comes
[1:00:36] brother ron i'm busy in my life who
[1:00:38] ain't busy
[1:00:41] just tell me who ain't busy and i'll
[1:00:42] give them something to do
[1:00:49] but most of our situations is where we
[1:00:51] create our own problems
[1:00:55] and then we blame the devil for our
[1:00:57] problems
[1:00:59] we create our own problems and then
[1:01:01] expect god to come rushing on the scene
[1:01:04] for the things that we created
[1:01:08] we ate those donuts we ate that cake we
[1:01:11] ate all that pie and then we asked god
[1:01:13] to drop a hundred pounds for us
[1:01:15] baby you put it in you're gonna have to
[1:01:17] work to get it off
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:31] you thought that i would leave it there
[1:01:33] you watch those filthy movies
[1:01:38] you read that filthy trash
[1:01:40] and now you've got demons hanging all in
[1:01:42] your life you got to go on your knees

[1:02:13] of hocus pocus over top of us or speak
[1:02:16] in tongues over top of us to get rid of
[1:02:18] the nonsense in our life that we let in
[1:02:20] our life
[1:02:22] god gave you a word to put protection
[1:02:24] around you but you let them demons in
[1:02:27] you gotta fight
[1:02:29] you gotta engage them to get them out of
[1:02:32] your life
[1:02:43] but don't you feel like it's over just
[1:02:44] cause they're there fight

[1:05:14] i mentioned them to you last week
[1:05:17] feeling the water i was filling the
[1:05:19] water in that service
[1:05:21] sometimes you don't understand what what
[1:05:23] happens
[1:05:24] to a preacher while he preaches
[1:05:27] especially if he's a gifted man
[1:05:30] toward the end of the service you saw me
[1:05:31] get enormously
[1:05:33] emotional
[1:05:35] and being led off of the stage
[1:05:38] but as i talked to you about the woman
[1:05:41] washing jesus's feet
[1:05:43] i saw the most phenomenal
[1:05:45] vision i've ever seen in my life
[1:05:50] as i was talking to you about
[1:05:53] her laying there under those blankets
[1:05:55] and men would get up and throw their
[1:05:58] filthy their filthy money down on top of
[1:06:01] her
[1:06:02] i was seeing that in vision
[1:06:04] but that wasn't all the vision where i
[1:06:07] got to incredibly emotional
[1:06:09] is is the vision transferred to standing
[1:06:13] behind the lord jesus
[1:06:16] and watching her wash his feet
[1:06:21] and when i saw that it was over
[1:06:26] in this building
[1:06:28] brother tim pruitt was preaching
[1:06:34] yes he's my friend
[1:06:36] but he was seeing what many of you maybe
[1:06:39] many of you didn't get to see
[1:06:42] but i was laying and the doctors had now
[1:06:44] given me up and i'd slipped into a
[1:06:46] non-responsive state sister carney came
[1:06:49] to service because that's our source of
[1:06:52] strength
[1:06:54] and i want to say it again satan has
[1:06:57] underestimated you
[1:07:00] so here under the pressure of her
[1:07:03] husband that has preached all of these
[1:07:05] years and now is laying in a spot to
[1:07:09] where that the doctors have given up
[1:07:12] and there's no more that they can do
[1:07:15] god is saying across this pulpit
[1:07:18] god will have a testimony
[1:07:31] she writes these notes
[1:07:33] our daily walk with god trials
[1:07:37] satan
[1:07:38] cannot destroy us
[1:07:41] until god
[1:07:43] gives him permission
[1:07:48] now help me preach
[1:07:49] i want to say this to you and leave that
[1:07:51] lay this with you satan can't touch a
[1:07:54] hair of your head
[1:07:57] he can't touch a hair of your head until
[1:07:59] he goes before our god and gets
[1:08:01] permission to do it
[1:08:03] then you can count it all joy because
[1:08:06] god's got confidence in you that you can
[1:08:08] make it through your trial so let's quit
[1:08:11] thinking negative about the trial
[1:08:16] hallelujah
[1:08:25] god has a reason for everything god is
[1:08:28] in control
[1:08:34] real christians with heart disease
[1:08:36] cancer real christians
[1:08:39] families with financial troubles
[1:08:42] all kinds of tribulation
[1:08:45] there is a reason for it
[1:08:49] where god can produce spiritual growth
[1:08:55] we got to understand god's grace
[1:08:58] we got to understand that the footsteps
[1:09:01] of the righteous
[1:09:05] are you with me
[1:09:06] the footsteps of the righteous
[1:09:09] are ordered of the lord
[1:09:20] our brother's sitting back in the
[1:09:21] wheelchair
[1:09:26] he's listening to me preach
[1:09:32] and god speaks supernaturally
[1:09:35] using my voice
[1:09:37] you can get help there
[1:09:43] they moved a long way
[1:09:46] because god supernaturally spoke to him
[1:09:49] you get help there
[1:09:54] isn't that true
[1:09:56] yeah
[1:09:58] that's true
[1:10:02] god knows how to speak to your heart
[1:10:05] sister connie
[1:10:08] just raise your hand there's a lot of
[1:10:10] people in the world haven't seen you
[1:10:17] she came to church knowing that i had
[1:10:20] slipped into a non-responsive
[1:10:24] state
[1:10:27] and she sat behind you and
[1:10:29] sister evelyn and sister joyce
[1:10:35] and she spoke to you guys that it wasn't
[1:10:38] good
[1:10:40] but that wasn't what you heard from the
[1:10:41] pulpit

[1:10:52] little part here
[1:10:54] that wasn't what you heard from the
[1:10:55] pulpit
[1:10:56] your troubles today
[1:10:58] may not be non-responsive activity but
[1:11:01] look at the result 15 years later
[1:11:08] but the best goal is brother connor you

[1:12:22] the eternity
[1:12:24] queens will sit there as as ministers
[1:12:26] wives of the men that carried the gospel
[1:12:29] of jesus christ as those men's hands are
[1:12:32] the earth names are called and that you
[1:12:35] join as you walk up that great that gray
[1:12:38] stairs that day audience will chill
[1:12:44] so what you cheer what you fear today
[1:12:48] doesn't matter
[1:12:50] the aggravation of this life doesn't
[1:12:52] matter
[1:12:54] it's not what today holds for us but
[1:12:57] it's what eternity
[1:13:00] [Applause]
[1:13:11] brother brown said you
[1:13:13] you know your enemy you train for him
[1:13:15] you train for a contest
[1:13:17] that you're going to have to meet him
[1:13:18] because
[1:13:19] you're going to meet him
[1:13:21] and you know
[1:13:24] know what his strength is and train for
[1:13:25] the contest and when you do meet him
[1:13:28] for it's one sure thing that you're
[1:13:30] going to meet him so train
[1:13:33] for the contest
[1:13:35] now training for a contest is like a
[1:13:37] boxer
[1:13:40] his enemy
[1:13:41] that he is going to meet out there in
[1:13:43] this contest to fight a real good
[1:13:45] fighter usually knows and studies his
[1:13:47] opponent
[1:13:49] he knows his lips he studies his licks
[1:13:51] he knows where he's fighting where he
[1:13:54] leans forward hangs back fights right
[1:13:57] left-handed brother branham was saying
[1:13:59] all those things
[1:14:00] because he was an undefeated fighter
[1:14:04] this is more than a quote
[1:14:06] he was given us
[1:14:08] the training that he had as a young man
[1:14:11] that now he's using in a pulpit
[1:14:18] are you with me
[1:14:20] and he's saying those dark lines going
[1:14:22] all across the building he's watching
[1:14:24] them
[1:14:26] he's not only watching the angel the
[1:14:27] lord and the presence of the lord and
[1:14:29] the pillar of fire of the lord but he's
[1:14:30] watching those demons run for cover
[1:14:35] and yet he's standing there preaching
[1:14:36] the gospel because he knows that is what
[1:14:38] will defeat the devil anywhere
[1:14:41] any place anytime
[1:14:44] now here's what i want to do with all of
[1:14:46] that
[1:14:47] you may not be able to see dark lines in
[1:14:49] the building demons running for cover
[1:14:51] but what you can do is take the word of
[1:14:53] god and defeat the devil
[1:14:56] anywhere
[1:14:58] any place
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:10] god is our strength
[1:15:12] psalms 46-1 god is our strength
[1:15:15] and a very present help in trouble
[1:15:18] because god knows you're as human beings

[1:16:12] therefore
[1:16:13] will not we fear
[1:16:16] though the earth be removed and though
[1:16:18] the mountains will be carried into the
[1:16:19] midst of the sea though the waters
[1:16:21] thereof roar and be troubled though the
[1:16:23] mountains shake and the swelling thereof
[1:16:25] salah there is a river and the streams
[1:16:28] whereof shall make glad and the city of
[1:16:31] god
[1:16:34] the holy place of the tabernacle of the
[1:16:36] most high god is in the midst of her
[1:16:39] and she shall not be moved god shall
[1:16:42] help her and that right early the
[1:16:45] heathen rage the kingdoms were moved and
[1:16:48] he uttered his voice and the earth
[1:16:50] melted the lord of hosts is with us and
[1:16:53] the god of jacob is our refuge
[1:16:58] i like just reminding the devil whose
[1:17:00] side i'm on
[1:17:02] [Applause]
[1:17:04] i may be five foot five seem absolutely
[1:17:07] insignificant but you don't know devil
[1:17:10] who's on the inside of here
[1:17:18] come behold the works of the lord what
[1:17:20] the desolations he hath made in the
[1:17:23] earth he maketh wars to cease unto the
[1:17:26] end of the earth he breaketh the bow
[1:17:28] that cutteth the spear and the sunda he
[1:17:31] burneth the chariot in the fire be still
[1:17:33] and know that i am god
[1:17:36] i will be exalted among the heather and
[1:17:38] i will be exalted in the earth
[1:17:41] the lord of the host is with us the god
[1:17:43] of jacob
[1:17:45] is our refuge
[1:17:48] why don't you just tell your enemy right
[1:17:50] now if he's setting close to you and i'm
[1:17:51] not talking about your wife
[1:17:53] god is my refuge
[1:18:01] brother braham said god said
[1:18:04] i am the lord thy god
[1:18:06] that heals
[1:18:08] all of your diseases
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:17] do you really believe that
[1:18:22] so that means he heals all your diseases
[1:18:27] but brother branham's brother ron so and
[1:18:29] so died
[1:18:30] he healed that disease
[1:18:38] he healed it
[1:18:39] i die in the morning don't you have no
[1:18:41] weeping
[1:18:43] doubting party cause i'm gonna be
[1:18:46] dancing
[1:18:50] i'm gonna be running i don't know how
[1:18:52] many hands i'm going to shake before i
[1:18:54] start running like never before
[1:18:58] i'm going to be free no more 20 pills in
[1:19:01] the morning and 20 at night i'm going to
[1:19:03] be free

[1:19:07] seizures no more is situations
[1:19:11] i'm gonna be free
[1:19:13] if he sets me free here no more none of
[1:19:16] that
[1:19:18] either way i'm gonna be a winner
[1:19:32] jesus said if a house is to be divided
[1:19:34] against itself if satan cast out satan
[1:19:37] then then the kingdoms divided
[1:19:41] don't you underestimate the devil
[1:19:44] he's too smart for that
[1:19:46] satan ain't going to cast himself out
[1:19:51] he's just got you confused that's all
[1:19:55] no sir satan can't cast out satan
[1:19:58] me cast myself out well i know better
[1:20:01] than that
[1:20:03] notice
[1:20:04] and don't unders underestimate jesus
[1:20:07] either
[1:20:08] here's where this came from i'm not that
[1:20:10] smart
[1:20:12] because he's the power
[1:20:15] over
[1:20:16] all
[1:20:17] powers
[1:20:20] won't you say it
[1:20:22] my jesus
[1:20:23] is the power
[1:20:25] over
[1:20:26] all powers
[1:20:30] every devil in hell
[1:20:35] big ones little ones middle size ones
[1:20:39] squirmy-eyed devils
[1:20:43] boastful demons temper devils
[1:20:46] stubborn devils
[1:20:48] lustful devils
[1:20:51] jesus is more powerful
[1:20:56] polio devils
[1:20:58] he's more powerful
[1:21:01] so the more that you look at that little
[1:21:03] boy's arm your jesus is more powerful
[1:21:07] than the demon that affects that
[1:21:18] now maybe you're here this morning and
[1:21:20] you're a sinner you don't know god but
[1:21:21] let me just say this to you i don't care
[1:21:23] what you're saying is my jesus is
[1:21:25] greater than that sin
[1:21:28] maybe you're sitting on the internet
[1:21:30] somewhere another and you live in such a
[1:21:31] defiled life and your life is raunchy
[1:21:34] and you feel like you can't crime out
[1:21:36] the bottom of the gutter my jesus has
[1:21:38] got the cure for that
[1:21:48] i had a taxi dry cab driver in china
[1:21:53] and he was homeless
[1:21:58] he had nothing
[1:22:00] he slept on the streets
[1:22:04] and somebody put a book in his hand
[1:22:08] and he believed what that book said
[1:22:10] about him
[1:22:12] became a preacher
[1:22:14] had a family when i got there
[1:22:18] had a taxicab business
[1:22:20] lived in a good neighborhood god knows
[1:22:23] how to fix you in every way that you can
[1:22:27] be fixed
[1:22:38] i want to say it to you if you think you
[1:22:40] can't be fixed you haven't met my jesus
[1:22:43] [Applause]
[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:47] and just just to give you a recount the
[1:22:50] woman at the well thought she couldn't
[1:22:51] be fixed
[1:22:53] legion thought he couldn't be fixed
[1:22:56] the man that was a leopard thought he
[1:22:58] could not be fixed
[1:23:00] [Applause]
[1:23:07] don't underesti underestimate this jesus
[1:23:13] don't underestimate this jesus
[1:23:21] don't underestimate that
[1:23:23] when jaybird back there
[1:23:25] started playing tennis
[1:23:31] i thought tennis
[1:23:34] have you seen jay
[1:23:37] have you seen james
[1:23:41] that don't that don't look like a tennis
[1:23:43] player
[1:23:44] and then i got to hear and he's winning
[1:23:51] i'm sure people walked out on the on the
[1:23:53] court this is okay jay
[1:23:55] walked out on the court and said
[1:23:57] look who i'm playing today
[1:24:01] [Applause]
[1:24:02] this is going to be fun here comes old
[1:24:05] skinny nelly and he walks out there
[1:24:09] and he starts serving to that old boy
[1:24:11] over there on the court and all of a
[1:24:12] sudden he's running places he ain't
[1:24:14] never running his life and he's this guy
[1:24:17] over here has underestimated his enemy
[1:24:20] [Applause]
[1:24:33] i'm sure the devil walks up to you
[1:24:35] sometimes and looks and goes oh that's
[1:24:37] my assignment today
[1:24:41] [Music]
[1:24:56] they sent me to his address
[1:25:01] i got a ride in a tractor trailer with
[1:25:03] him today
[1:25:08] and then he starts playing a prophet's
[1:25:10] mess and you go oh
[1:25:16] i met him in the prayer line
[1:25:20] oh baby huh
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:48] and that little girl walked up
[1:25:51] i think it was two different occasions
[1:25:53] walked up and
[1:25:55] nothing but white in its eyes
[1:25:57] and brother branham stood there
[1:26:01] prayed for it
[1:26:04] i'm sure there was a lot of skeptics in
[1:26:05] the building
[1:26:07] sure they were
[1:26:09] and in the middle of the prayer
[1:26:12] brother branham stops and says
[1:26:15] what color eyes
[1:26:16] would you like to have
[1:26:21] [Applause]
[1:26:31] blue
[1:26:36] and when when the baby turned
[1:26:39] they were the most beautiful blue eyes
[1:26:42] you ever see
[1:26:46] that's my jesus
[1:26:57] don't underestimate him
[1:27:00] don't underestimate him
[1:27:03] brother brahma is standing
[1:27:05] and he said i felt so sorry for this man
[1:27:07] he had been a worshiper of the son
[1:27:10] and he said he would be about my daddy's
[1:27:13] size
[1:27:14] notice brother branham the man
[1:27:16] and he said i put my shoe
[1:27:19] beside of his shoe to see if my shoe
[1:27:21] would fit him
[1:27:23] i put my hands around him and he said i
[1:27:26] wondered if my suit would
[1:27:28] fit him
[1:27:32] there was a lot of critics out there
[1:27:37] and brother branham saw a vision
[1:27:40] that he was healed
[1:27:42] now let me just say this to you once
[1:27:43] that vision breaks
[1:27:46] that prophet could stand there before
[1:27:48] every devil in hell
[1:27:53] because he knew that the god that said
[1:27:55] let there be a son
[1:27:59] and believed his own word
[1:28:01] i'm coming to a finish i'm not going to
[1:28:02] be much longer hang with me and he
[1:28:05] believed his own word in the same and it
[1:28:07] came into existence
[1:28:09] don't underestimate what god can do
[1:28:12] he created he created a sun that will
[1:28:15] never burn out
[1:28:19] because he likened it unto himself it'll
[1:28:21] never exhaust
[1:28:26] and so he sees a vision of this man well
[1:28:29] so now he can stand in front of every
[1:28:31] devil in hell
[1:28:33] and none of them
[1:28:35] none of them can step forward
[1:28:38] which of your gods
[1:28:41] will come heal this man
[1:28:43] your gods are so powerful which one are
[1:28:46] your gods
[1:28:47] you've been challenging me which of your
[1:28:50] gods
[1:28:53] will come heal this man
[1:28:55] brother branham had been put on the spot
[1:28:56] over and over and over again remember
[1:28:58] when he walks in and there's a witch
[1:29:00] that's got a table in the air
[1:29:04] and she challenges him
[1:29:07] and he calls all kinds of names
[1:29:09] but when he called the name of jesus
[1:29:11] christ that table came down so hard it
[1:29:14] broke the legs off of it
[1:29:23] maybe people want to steal skepticize
[1:29:25] brother branham and they always will
[1:29:27] because they don't even know who they

[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:54] so far the most difficult surgery of my
[1:37:56] life
[1:38:00] was when they took me in and i kissed
[1:38:02] sister connie goodbye
[1:38:05] and they took me in and put an apparatus
[1:38:07] on my head that would hold my head
[1:38:09] completely still for four hours
[1:38:12] and they would put me to sleep but even
[1:38:14] when you're still
[1:38:16] you sometimes squirm but they had to
[1:38:17] have my brain completely quiet
[1:38:21] i put eight
[1:38:23] stainless steel
[1:38:25] bolts
[1:38:27] in the structure of my brain
[1:38:29] the structure of my skull
[1:38:32] they told me that
[1:38:34] i would go to sleep for about seven
[1:38:36] minutes and wake up
[1:38:37] in excruciating pain
[1:38:41] and the
[1:38:42] woman at the end of the
[1:38:44] at the end of the
[1:38:49] bed
[1:38:50] was from a place called check
[1:38:53] check
[1:38:54] is seven miles from pilot where i grew
[1:38:57] up
[1:39:00] and i talked to her and she said keep
[1:39:01] your eyes focused on me
[1:39:03] and she said i'm a countdown for you
[1:39:05] and she said it's going to be it's going
[1:39:07] to be you're going to go to sleep
[1:39:09] and then we're going to wake you up and
[1:39:10] you're going to be fully alert but in
[1:39:12] excruciating pain
[1:39:14] and i said okay
[1:39:16] and when i woke up i had a harness
[1:39:18] all across my head steel rods going down
[1:39:20] this way steel rods going around my face
[1:39:23] and around my head
[1:39:25] and and that's what they would have to
[1:39:27] do to do brain surgery
[1:39:29] and so
[1:39:32] when i woke up i never had pain like
[1:39:34] that in my life
[1:39:36] and they said now we're going to give
[1:39:37] you some shots for the pain
[1:39:40] and they did
[1:39:42] didn't affect it
[1:39:44] and as they were going down the hall
[1:39:47] they took me by the lunch facility and i
[1:39:50] rolled my head forward and connie was on
[1:39:53] the phone
[1:39:55] sitting at one of the tables and i
[1:39:57] called out to her
[1:39:58] and she couldn't hear me
[1:40:01] but i called out to a higher authority
[1:40:03] than her
[1:40:05] and i said jesus jesus you're gonna have
[1:40:07] to help me
[1:40:09] i've never told this here i don't think
[1:40:13] and as they wheeled me down through a
[1:40:15] very dark hallway
[1:40:17] and went went across
[1:40:20] the guy that was willing to buggy
[1:40:23] i just began to pray
[1:40:26] i prayed what god laid on my heart god
[1:40:30] let me be the cycle breaker
[1:40:33] of this
[1:40:34] cancer because they had told me that
[1:40:37] it's a hereditary thing my mama had it
[1:40:39] on her skin her mother had it on her
[1:40:41] skin
[1:40:43] i they don't know where that i were that
[1:40:45] it started in my body
[1:40:47] so therefore they don't they can't go
[1:40:49] get the mother of it all but god knows
[1:40:51] where that's at
[1:40:53] and i said god here's what i pray
[1:40:55] and the reason i brought those two
[1:40:57] children up here they were impossible to
[1:41:00] start off with
[1:41:02] it was impossible for those children to
[1:41:04] be born but there was a vision
[1:41:07] and people that think that god don't do
[1:41:09] those things no more god gave us a
[1:41:10] vision that we were going to have those
[1:41:12] children
[1:41:15] listen the signs are in the church now
[1:41:17] they're all over the world not just here
[1:41:20] but these signs shall follow them that
[1:41:22] believed
[1:41:24] we had tongues speaking here we had
[1:41:25] prophecy here just a couple of weeks ago
[1:41:30] it's operated in the church getting us
[1:41:32] ready for the rapture
[1:41:34] and i prayed the prayer lord don't let
[1:41:37] me have to go through this
[1:41:42] without this
[1:41:43] being the cycle breaker of my family
[1:41:50] when i got to the room the man behind me
[1:41:52] said
[1:41:54] that is the most precious prayer
[1:41:56] i have ever heard
[1:41:58] in my life
[1:42:01] i'm going to tell you something
[1:42:04] when they laid me on that bed
[1:42:06] that man laid his hand on me
[1:42:10] and he prayed for me
[1:42:15] he said i'm gonna pray
[1:42:17] you're gonna be okay
[1:42:20] they gave me two more shots of
[1:42:22] medicine to help me to calm down
[1:42:28] and then just before
[1:42:31] just before the surgery would begin to
[1:42:33] take place
[1:42:34] they would give me another shot
[1:42:37] and they say we want you to lay steel
[1:42:40] brother roger when they put me in that
[1:42:42] tube
[1:42:43] and started doing surgery on me
[1:42:47] they they said we're going to play music
[1:42:49] behind you
[1:42:50] what would you like to hear
[1:42:52] and i said i'd like to hear some piano
[1:42:54] gospel
[1:42:56] and i went to sleep in about three
[1:42:58] minutes
[1:42:59] of that pioneer gospel
[1:43:01] and about three minutes before the
[1:43:02] surgery was completely over i woke up to
[1:43:05] amazing grace how sweet the sun
[1:43:15] like
[1:43:24] sorry
[1:43:26] sometimes sermons become very personal
[1:43:30] i want you to say it with me again satan

[1:43:40] the standard feet

[1:44:04] people that's here that's got all kind
[1:44:06] of situations during your life
