[57:05] this morning because this is the age
[57:07] that you live in

[57:13] for you
[57:14] to put your name to ron spencer
[57:19] that overcometh let's do that again
[57:22] put your name there to ron spencer
[57:26] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[57:29] me
[57:30] in my throne even as i
[57:34] also overcame
[57:37] and am set down with my father
[57:40] in his throne we've already got a place
[57:44] you can be seated
[57:52] if i could speak in this season this of
[57:55] the sermon this morning
[57:58] as brother andrew said there's a a
[58:00] context or a thought or an inspiration
[58:02] or a spark of life
[58:04] in every sermon that you hear sermons
[58:08] are inspired by maybe just a few words
[58:12] and then they begin to they begin to
[58:14] kind of just
[58:15] grow like a great snowball if we could
[58:18] put it like that
[58:19] and as it grows and it rolls it just
[58:21] gets it just gets more
[58:23] depth and it gets more power and it gets
[58:25] more inspiration as it grows
[58:28] and so for me this morning
[58:32] this sermon has great meaning like like
[58:34] never before
[58:36] i would like to speak to you on the mind
[58:39] of a champion
[58:43] the mind of a champion
[58:46] so if i could say it like this if i
[58:48] could put it in a carnal context
[58:50] to you just for a moment it feels like
[58:53] in this season of my life
[58:55] it feels like
[58:58] like two forces or two boxers
[59:01] have stood in the ring laid it all on
[59:05] the line
[59:07] every every trick every avenue
[59:10] everything has been laid on the line
[59:12] and now the answering of the bell is the
[59:15] 15th round
[59:18] now it's no more play it's it's
[59:21] everything
[59:24] it's everything it's eye to eye toe to
[59:26] toe
[59:29] we've answered the bell
[59:32] i'd like to report to our enemies camp
[59:35] we've answered the bell
[59:38] we've taken angles after angles after
[59:40] disturbance after disturbance
[59:43] and god's answered the bell in every
[59:45] situation
[59:47] if he brother brahma used a term he said
[59:49] if he can't get it's this way he'll come
[59:51] around this way and
[59:52] then he'll come around this way and
[59:54] he'll try an angle this way
[59:56] well god's been faithful in every avenue
[1:00:03] i'd like to just just forgive me for
[1:00:06] being this personal this morning but i'd
[1:00:08] like to just talk to
[1:00:09] the devil if we can satan i want to
[1:00:12] remind you we're enemies
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:18] i want to remind you personally we are
[1:00:21] enemies
[1:00:23] there's no love lost here
[1:00:28] we are enemies i will
[1:00:32] see your destruction
[1:00:36] i will be there when you're cast into
[1:00:38] outer darkness
[1:00:42] are you with me for me there is no
[1:00:45] turning around and going back
[1:00:48] i'm not here to whine i'm not here to
[1:00:51] have pity
[1:00:54] i'm here to win
[1:00:58] and at the end of the round i will be
[1:01:08] champion
[1:01:10] i'd like to say this for our ending of
[1:01:12] laodicea as we're seeing it
[1:01:16] if you were before the service you heard
[1:01:18] brother branham and
[1:01:20] in several quotations and then you saw
[1:01:22] the picture
[1:01:24] we are seeing the fulfillment of visions
[1:01:28] we are the ending seasons of laodicea
[1:01:32] it's supposed to be this way don't get
[1:01:35] yourself all tore up with conspiracy
[1:01:38] theories and all kind of different
[1:01:39] things that's going on in the world
[1:01:41] it's supposed to be this way but
[1:01:45] we are supposed to be this way
[1:01:55] the world is in its final seasons and so
[1:01:58] are we
[1:02:00] they could not be doing what they're
[1:02:02] doing
[1:02:05] without you or where you're at
[1:02:09] for the season of the rapture
[1:02:13] are you with me now
[1:02:17] so let's remind him this day
[1:02:21] god has had champions in every age
[1:02:25] so let's remind him of a little bit of
[1:02:27] his history
[1:02:29] if we could for a few moments
[1:02:32] in hebrews chapter 11. paul is writing
[1:02:37] this scripture not from a plush office
[1:02:41] but from a dungeon he knows that he's in
[1:02:45] will be the chopping of his head off
[1:02:48] but did he ask for pity
[1:02:52] did he ask for people to be sorry for
[1:02:55] him
[1:02:56] as a matter of fact he doesn't even
[1:02:58] write in this text
[1:03:00] of where he's even at
[1:03:07] by faith the walls of jericho fell
[1:03:11] after they were compassed with seven
[1:03:13] about seven days
[1:03:16] by faith the harlot
[1:03:20] rahab perished not
[1:03:23] with them that belief not
[1:03:28] when she had received the spies
[1:03:31] with peace
[1:03:35] and what shall we more i more say for
[1:03:37] the time would fail me of
[1:03:40] to tell a gideon and a bear ark
[1:03:43] and of samson and of jeff and i
[1:03:46] and of david and of samuel and of the
[1:03:49] prophets
[1:03:51] you can imagine as he's sitting there
[1:03:53] putting his pen
[1:03:54] to whatever parchment of letter that he
[1:03:57] was writing this to
[1:03:59] every one of these individuals shook
[1:04:02] the realms of hell
[1:04:07] these are more than just names these are
[1:04:10] literally characters that stepped out of
[1:04:13] the mind of god
[1:04:14] into human flesh and overcame in their
[1:04:18] day
[1:04:21] are you with me and paul is calling
[1:04:24] their names and no doubt as he's
[1:04:26] writing them down the devils that are
[1:04:29] fighting paul
[1:04:30] so much as he's writing these names down
[1:04:34] had to shudder
[1:04:37] god was with them in that day
[1:04:42] are you with me let me just say this
[1:04:44] right here
[1:04:46] satan in the realm that he is able to
[1:04:48] operate in
[1:04:50] so afflicted these individuals
[1:04:53] from from gideon all the way through to
[1:04:57] hear the realms of
[1:04:58] of even rahab and her story and
[1:05:01] and the story of redemption and then at
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:05] end of it when it comes the last breath
[1:05:07] of life
[1:05:08] and all the torment they've had to live
[1:05:10] through
[1:05:11] those demons have to watch the
[1:05:15] angelic pallbearers
[1:05:23] come and take their spirit from this
[1:05:25] dimension
[1:05:26] to that dimension
[1:05:29] oh hallelujah
[1:05:34] now watch this who through faith subdued
[1:05:38] kingdoms
[1:05:40] wrought righteousness obtain
[1:05:43] promises stop the mouths of lions
[1:05:47] quench the violence of fire escape the
[1:05:50] edge of the sword
[1:05:52] outer weaknesses were made strong likes
[1:05:55] valued in fight turned to flight the
[1:05:57] armies of the alien
[1:06:00] women received their dead and raised to
[1:06:02] life again
[1:06:03] others were tortured not accepting
[1:06:06] deliverance
[1:06:09] that they might obtain a better
[1:06:10] resurrection
[1:06:14] there's a book of martyrs that has 68
[1:06:16] million
[1:06:17] christians in it that the catholic
[1:06:20] church
[1:06:21] destroyed none of them
[1:06:24] said i'm going to turn around and run
[1:06:26] back
[1:06:29] all of them stood in the face of
[1:06:31] opposition
[1:06:32] and god received them you're talking
[1:06:35] about a book of faith
[1:06:39] are you with me in our family we've got
[1:06:42] courage and confidence and i'm not
[1:06:44] talking about the spencer family
[1:06:46] i'm talking about the family of god
[1:06:51] so we stand on the edge of this realm of
[1:06:55] of the ending of gentile age to the
[1:06:58] to the brand new day
[1:07:03] and we stand here with courage in our
[1:07:05] eyes
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:12] they were stoned they were sewn asunder
[1:07:18] were tempted were slain with the sword
[1:07:22] they wondered about in sheepskins and
[1:07:25] goat skins
[1:07:26] being destitute and afflicted
[1:07:30] and tormented of whom the world was not
[1:07:34] worthy
[1:07:38] they wondered in deserts
[1:07:41] and in mountains and in dens and caves
[1:07:45] of the earth
[1:07:46] and these all having obtained a good
[1:07:49] report through
[1:07:50] faith receive not the promise
[1:07:53] god providing some better thing for us
[1:07:57] that they without us
[1:08:03] are you with me the completion of
[1:08:05] redemption cannot be
[1:08:07] done until we finish
[1:08:12] hallelujah they without
[1:08:16] us should not be made perfect
[1:08:22] chapter 12 and verse 1. wherefore see
[1:08:25] and we're compassed about with so
[1:08:26] greater cloud of
[1:08:27] witnesses let us lay aside
[1:08:30] every weight and the sin which does so
[1:08:34] easily beset us
[1:08:36] and let us run
[1:08:40] with patience the race that is set
[1:08:43] before us
[1:08:46] looking unto jesus the author
[1:08:49] and the finisher of our faith
[1:08:53] who for the joy was set before him
[1:08:56] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:08:59] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:09:01] throne of god
[1:09:03] to god be the glory for all the things
[1:09:07] that he has done
[1:09:09] philippians chapter 2 and verse 5 let
[1:09:11] this mind be in you
[1:09:13] which was also in christ jesus who being
[1:09:16] in the form of god
[1:09:17] thought not robbery to be equal with god
[1:09:21] but made himself of no reputation
[1:09:24] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:09:27] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:09:30] and being found in a fashion as a man he
[1:09:33] humbled himself and became obedient
[1:09:37] unto death even the death of the cross
[1:09:41] philippians chapter 3 and verse 12 if
[1:09:44] all of those other scriptures hasn't
[1:09:46] made the devil nervous
[1:09:47] let's just continue to torture him
[1:09:50] paul says not as though i had already
[1:09:53] attained
[1:09:54] either were already perfect but i follow
[1:09:58] after
[1:09:59] that if i may apprehend that for which
[1:10:02] also i am apprehended of of christ jesus
[1:10:06] brethren i count not myself too
[1:10:08] apprehended
[1:10:09] but this one thing that i do forgetting
[1:10:12] those things which are behind
[1:10:15] and reaching forth to the things which
[1:10:17] are before
[1:10:18] i press towards the mark of the hype
[1:10:22] of the prize of the high calling of god
[1:10:25] in christ jesus
[1:10:36] isaiah chapter 54
[1:10:40] god is igniting his servant to speak
[1:10:42] right directly to the enemy
[1:10:46] behold i have created the smith
[1:10:49] that bloweth the coals in the fire
[1:10:54] that bringeth forth an instrument for
[1:10:56] his work
[1:10:58] and i have created the waster to destroy
[1:11:03] now notice the next verse because god's
[1:11:05] not done with this thought
[1:11:08] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:11:14] shall prosper i want you to say that
[1:11:17] with me
[1:11:18] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:11:22] shall prosper
[1:11:34] in the 15th round of a battle
[1:11:40] all the training that you have been
[1:11:42] through
[1:11:45] all of the scars that you have now
[1:11:48] carried
[1:11:50] has got you ready for this final round
[1:11:55] many of you have been decades
[1:11:58] serving the lord but if you could only
[1:12:02] realize
[1:12:03] how close we are
[1:12:10] to the coming of the lord
[1:12:13] are you with me now
[1:12:18] you've never had it i hadn't
[1:12:21] a circumstances like
[1:12:24] that has happened in just the last year
[1:12:27] or so
[1:12:30] the world has been besieged
[1:12:33] and shut in and economies not just of
[1:12:37] america but economies of the world
[1:12:40] have suffered because of covet
[1:12:45] and the many things that have happened
[1:12:49] and sometimes we would ask is is
[1:12:51] everything out of cater
[1:12:53] or is everything kind of off base and
[1:12:56] what is happening
[1:12:58] who is in control let me just say this
[1:13:00] to you
[1:13:02] god's in control of everything
[1:13:08] and he uses the enemy as a tool
[1:13:14] as a tool let me say even in the
[1:13:18] tribulation period much worse will come
[1:13:20] upon the earth
[1:13:22] because of satan's tools that are in his
[1:13:25] arsenal
[1:13:26] but up to this point there's a bride on
[1:13:29] the earth
[1:13:31] that stands like the moon over top of
[1:13:34] the ocean
[1:13:36] that's far enough
[1:13:40] and that wave cannot come one inch
[1:13:44] further
[1:13:46] then what it is because
[1:13:49] god's got it in control sometimes you
[1:13:53] just need to turn and tell the devil
[1:13:55] that's enough
[1:14:07] i find it interesting there's several
[1:14:09] sermons that that
[1:14:10] we draw this con this context from
[1:14:13] one being the greatest battle ever
[1:14:15] fought
[1:14:16] the other other one that that comes is
[1:14:20] the contest
[1:14:21] which is a short brief sermon just
[1:14:24] before the changing of the new year from
[1:14:26] 62 to 63.
[1:14:29] brother braham said the dying out of 62
[1:14:32] and everything that's happened is 62.
[1:14:34] we could say the dying out of 2020 and
[1:14:37] how horrendous that it was
[1:14:39] for many of us as we went through some
[1:14:42] very difficult situations
[1:14:44] but i have found that god masters
[1:14:46] difficult situations
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:51] i have found that there's nothing
[1:14:53] impossible with god
[1:14:56] i have found that circumstances
[1:14:59] really don't matter
[1:15:05] are you with me i have also found
[1:15:10] that god put something in our heart no
[1:15:12] matter how hot the battle goes
[1:15:15] there's something inside of us that's
[1:15:17] driven
[1:15:19] that presses us when you feel like
[1:15:22] giving up and you feel like all of your
[1:15:25] energies and your reserves have come to
[1:15:28] an end
[1:15:29] it seems like god just comes with a
[1:15:32] resource
[1:15:34] and beyond your mortality presses you
[1:15:37] forward
[1:15:44] as i've said it before winston churchill
[1:15:46] stood
[1:15:48] and they they the the previous man that
[1:15:51] stood before him
[1:15:53] talked about how great winston churchill
[1:15:56] was as an
[1:15:57] orator what a great speaker that he was
[1:15:59] and he went on for quite a bit
[1:16:01] talk introducing winston churchill and
[1:16:04] he stepped up and there was a war
[1:16:06] that was preemptive and was ready to
[1:16:08] take place
[1:16:10] and it looked like the world was going
[1:16:12] to fall to this enemy
[1:16:15] and he walks to the podium
[1:16:18] and here's a man named winston churchill
[1:16:20] who fought a lot of complexes
[1:16:23] and a lot of demons and a lot of things
[1:16:25] in his own life
[1:16:27] but he said some phenomenal words in
[1:16:29] this instance
[1:16:31] never give up
[1:16:35] and he paused and paused about 60
[1:16:38] seconds
[1:16:39] and he said never give up
[1:16:45] and he paused another 60 seconds and he
[1:16:48] spoke again
[1:16:49] never and this time with an extreme
[1:16:53] scream
[1:16:54] never give up
[1:16:58] and he turned around and sat down
[1:17:05] thousands of people didn't realize
[1:17:08] he had just gave them the greatest
[1:17:10] speech that he could have given
[1:17:14] if i could look across the vast bride of
[1:17:17] jesus christ
[1:17:20] and if i could remind us of no matter
[1:17:22] what your condition is or no matter what
[1:17:24] discouraged that you might go through
[1:17:28] i'd like to speak to you never give up
[1:17:33] [Applause]
[1:17:41] now i want to pause to remind you i was
[1:17:44] preaching this
[1:17:47] 20 years ago
[1:17:52] i was preaching this 20 years ago
[1:17:57] been burned had strokes have heart
[1:18:00] conditions i've now
[1:18:03] had been burned and laid in a coma for a
[1:18:06] month
[1:18:08] a lot of difficulties over the last year
[1:18:12] but i stand with the same resolve and
[1:18:14] even greater
[1:18:16] and i say to you never
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:25] give up
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:35] i'd like to pull from a young man as a
[1:18:39] boy
[1:18:40] this young man was burned in a fire
[1:18:44] the fire burned his legs the doctor said
[1:18:48] let's
[1:18:48] take his legs off because they were
[1:18:51] burned so bad
[1:18:53] the young boy named glenn said please
[1:18:55] don't take my legs
[1:18:58] please don't take my legs for the next
[1:19:01] months they would do their best to take
[1:19:05] care of him but
[1:19:07] they had no answers glenn would now sit
[1:19:10] in a wheelchair
[1:19:12] with those scarred burned legs
[1:19:16] that now had forgotten how to walk
[1:19:20] but glenn had the mind of a champion
[1:19:24] it's something that schools can't teach
[1:19:28] it's something that coaches encourage
[1:19:31] speeches are given and trying to bring
[1:19:35] something out of people that sometimes
[1:19:37] they really don't have
[1:19:40] people look for champions and they think
[1:19:42] they're champions
[1:19:43] but sometimes champions are within and
[1:19:46] it can't be
[1:19:47] seen the size of a man's heart the drive
[1:19:51] inside of a man
[1:19:52] cannot be seen that's only what god
[1:19:55] deposits on the inside of you
[1:19:59] that's the bride of jesus christ we're
[1:20:01] built to be overcomers
[1:20:02] we're built to be the champions of this
[1:20:05] age
[1:20:06] when the devil would wane against you in
[1:20:08] war against you to give up
[1:20:10] god put something on the inside of you
[1:20:14] that only he could put there
[1:20:21] glenn would wheel himself out to the to
[1:20:23] the gate to the
[1:20:24] picket fence of his house that went
[1:20:27] around his house
[1:20:30] he would watch all the children playing
[1:20:32] up and down the streets
[1:20:38] and he wanted to be with them
[1:20:42] and one day courage mustered on the
[1:20:44] inside of him
[1:20:47] and he grabbed a hole to the fence
[1:20:51] and he pulled himself up
[1:20:55] to that fence and he stood there
[1:20:58] and he stood there as long as his little
[1:21:00] feeble legs would let him stand
[1:21:03] so day after day he would go out and
[1:21:05] grab a hold of the fence
[1:21:07] and pull himself up
[1:21:11] one day he took a step
[1:21:18] and he took another step
[1:21:21] and day after day he grabbed a halt of
[1:21:23] the fence
[1:21:25] and took another step in his life
[1:21:29] let me just say this you sometimes you
[1:21:31] feel like you're still sitting in a
[1:21:32] wheelchair
[1:21:34] or you're in a in the bottom of the
[1:21:36] barrel of your life
[1:21:37] grab a hold of the fence
[1:21:41] grab a hold of the bars that are in
[1:21:43] front of you
[1:21:46] are you with me pull up
[1:21:49] there's not a hundred people around me
[1:21:51] supporting sometimes you gotta overcome
[1:21:53] by yourself
[1:21:55] you're the man in the arena you're the
[1:21:59] guy that's got a box
[1:22:01] you're the man that's got to take the
[1:22:03] licks you're the man that's got to give
[1:22:05] the fight
[1:22:08] don't let the enemy take the fight to
[1:22:10] you you take the fight to him
[1:22:16] come on church we're not sent here to be
[1:22:19] tormented by the devil
[1:22:21] we're sent here to torment him
[1:22:39] brother ron that's not scriptural let me
[1:22:41] give you some scripture
[1:22:42] as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:22:47] if you think you're defeated all the
[1:22:49] time that's the way you
[1:22:50] are if you think you're backslidden all
[1:22:53] the time that's the way you are
[1:22:55] if you think nobody loves you and you
[1:22:57] believe it that's the way you are
[1:22:59] but as a man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:23:02] he
[1:23:05] the scripture also said greater is he
[1:23:08] that is in you
[1:23:09] than he that is in the world the
[1:23:12] scripture always also
[1:23:13] said who shall lay anything to the
[1:23:15] charge of god's elect
[1:23:17] it is god that justify
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:24] the scripture says i can do all things
[1:23:35] glenn cunningham
[1:23:40] went to the olympics
[1:23:44] as a mile runner
[1:23:48] he shattered every world
[1:23:51] record
[1:23:55] of that day he was the first one to get
[1:24:00] close
[1:24:01] to the four-minute mile
[1:24:08] for the person that was watching him for
[1:24:10] the first time
[1:24:12] no way could they understand what he
[1:24:16] went through
[1:24:20] to get where he was there's a lot of
[1:24:24] people
[1:24:24] look at you and want to be where you're
[1:24:27] at
[1:24:28] but they're not willing to go through
[1:24:30] what you went through
[1:24:31] to be where you're at
[1:24:36] come on i'm going to put the art dart in
[1:24:38] the enemy a lot of people want to
[1:24:40] criticize me for
[1:24:42] what i am but you ought to have
[1:24:45] walked in some of the footsteps
[1:24:58] sure there's going to be a palace of
[1:25:00] resistance come against you
[1:25:04] sure you're going to have difficulty but
[1:25:06] it's supposed to be that way
[1:25:12] the way there's going to be shattered
[1:25:14] dreams that you're going to have to go
[1:25:15] through
[1:25:17] when you hear brother branham talk about
[1:25:18] his life story
[1:25:20] i don't know if you've ever listened to
[1:25:22] it over and over again
[1:25:24] but no matter how many times that i
[1:25:26] listen to it i weep and i
[1:25:27] cry
[1:25:32] i think about all the darts that came
[1:25:34] against brother branham in his day
[1:25:38] but he stood like a gentleman
[1:25:42] at under 150 pounds he stood like a
[1:25:45] gentleman
[1:25:46] it was a short man
[1:25:50] but as a short man he stood there
[1:25:53] amongst
[1:25:54] giants of that day a lot amongst a lot
[1:25:57] of degrees of that day
[1:26:00] but let me just say god developed him
[1:26:07] to be the messenger of this day to carry
[1:26:11] word of the scriptures that
[1:26:14] no man had ever been entrusted to carry
[1:26:20] let me preface that spurgeon told
[1:26:23] all of the thousands of preachers that
[1:26:26] came through his school
[1:26:28] don't touch those seven seals there will
[1:26:31] come a prophet
[1:26:34] are you with me and if a man hundreds of
[1:26:36] years ago would remind
[1:26:38] his preachers of that day don't touch it
[1:26:42] god sent us a prophet in this day
[1:26:46] and i'm not apologetic for it he sent us
[1:26:49] a messenger in this day
[1:26:51] to give us the reveal word of this day
[1:26:55] because we would need it
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:27:00] to overcome this lukewarm laodicea
[1:27:05] sodom and gomorrah that we're living in
[1:27:09] but we have been given the weapons of
[1:27:11] our warfare
[1:27:13] god didn't hold nothing back for me and
[1:27:16] you
[1:27:22] hallelujah you say well brother ron i'm
[1:27:24] not i'm not even
[1:27:26] i'm i'm so weak i can't hardly stand on
[1:27:28] my feet
[1:27:29] brother braham said the weakest of
[1:27:30] christians when they go on their knees
[1:27:34] they shake the kingdom of hell
[1:27:54] i don't know
[1:27:58] too many of brother branham's prayers
[1:28:01] but they're very powerful
[1:28:05] and lay hands on people dear jesus touch
[1:28:09] touch this individual touch this patient
[1:28:12] may they be healed and go home in the
[1:28:15] name of jesus christ
[1:28:17] and they go dear jesus
[1:28:21] touch them heal them in the name of
[1:28:23] jesus christ
[1:28:25] may they be healed in jesus christ's
[1:28:27] name
[1:28:31] i'm doing this for an example and then
[1:28:34] another
[1:28:35] but he didn't call my name he don't have
[1:28:37] to
[1:28:39] he didn't call my address he didn't have
[1:28:41] to
[1:28:43] because of who he was
[1:28:48] and the authority that he was standing
[1:28:50] under
[1:28:52] every demon recognized
[1:28:57] who he was what he was standing under
[1:29:02] and that demon knew that i have to leave
[1:29:06] because i've been commanded to leave in
[1:29:08] the name of jesus
[1:29:10] christ now let me just say this to you
[1:29:13] you're a believer
[1:29:18] you're a believer and you have authority
[1:29:22] greater authority than the archangels
[1:29:24] that are in heaven
[1:29:27] and your prayers are going right
[1:29:29] straight
[1:29:30] to our lord jesus christ our great high
[1:29:32] priest
[1:29:33] that great intercessor and that demon in
[1:29:36] that realm
[1:29:38] recognizes i've gotta go
[1:29:52] so what does that make you unmovable
[1:30:04] unstoppable
[1:30:07] undefeated
[1:30:12] i've read some forgive me i'm
[1:30:16] i hope can you just hand me a tissue
[1:30:21] i've muhammad ali
[1:30:26] it's not for debate now but was
[1:30:28] recognized as one of the greatest
[1:30:30] fighters that ever fought
[1:30:32] in his corner he had a trainer and that
[1:30:35] trainer was called
[1:30:36] angelo dundee
[1:30:44] and he would he would talk to him
[1:30:48] between rounds and remind him
[1:30:53] of the things that they have trained to
[1:30:56] do
[1:31:00] he never told muhammad ali
[1:31:04] you're going to get whipped tonight
[1:31:10] he never told him that the enemy that's
[1:31:12] facing you you're not a match for him
[1:31:18] one of the most famous words that he
[1:31:20] would tell him is
[1:31:21] remember who you are
[1:31:31] you want another one
[1:31:36] duke sorry to get on some of you duke
[1:31:39] fans
[1:31:41] but duke was in their historical
[1:31:44] historically they were getting beat
[1:31:48] by a greater score than it ever been and
[1:31:51] it looked
[1:31:52] horrendous and finally the
[1:31:55] coach called them over mike
[1:31:58] called them into the into the circle in
[1:32:02] a time
[1:32:02] out and they would ask them later
[1:32:05] what did he say
[1:32:09] he said they want to tell you something
[1:32:12] remember who you are
[1:32:18] now i may be speaking to somebody in a
[1:32:20] hospital
[1:32:22] or somebody that's having great issues
[1:32:25] this morning
[1:32:26] or somebody that's going through great
[1:32:28] difficulty
[1:32:29] and i want to go into the place to where
[1:32:32] god
[1:32:33] and satan said we're going to meet there
[1:32:37] the battleground of your mind that's
[1:32:40] where we're going to meet
[1:32:42] so i'm going to stand in your corner for
[1:32:45] a few minutes
[1:32:46] i want you to remember who you are
[1:32:57] the enemy that looks so incredible
[1:33:01] and the odds are so great
[1:33:07] now let me just remind you it isn't you
[1:33:11] that brags on how big your enemy is
[1:33:16] the enemy will make sure that you know
[1:33:18] how big he is
[1:33:22] no matter how cubits he is tie no matter
[1:33:25] how big his head
[1:33:26] is no matter how big the sword is or the
[1:33:28] spear is that he's got
[1:33:31] the enemy will make sure you know how
[1:33:34] big he is but all it takes is a rock
[1:33:37] about that size
[1:33:43] placed in the right hands
[1:33:47] that enemy will have breathed his last
[1:33:50] breath so satan you be

[1:37:35] him
[1:37:36] and with his stripes
[1:37:41] we are healed
[1:38:00] i was in a doctor's office this week
[1:38:02] waiting for the doctor to come in
[1:38:07] and he sees hundreds of patients a day
[1:38:12] and he's actually been
[1:38:15] here past the church we've become a kind
[1:38:18] of a friend

[1:38:24] where's a bow tie
[1:38:26] he calls me the ref
[1:38:31] and he was talking to two of his
[1:38:35] doctors
[1:38:39] that are under him these training
[1:38:42] residents and i could hear through the
[1:38:46] door
[1:38:47] hopefully you don't hear this but i
[1:38:50] could hear through the door
[1:38:51] him say now when you go in
[1:38:56] this man looks like a picture of health
[1:39:03] i thought that was a nice compliment
[1:39:07] and he said but he's the sickest man
[1:39:09] that will have visit this
[1:39:10] this clinic so you be careful look

[1:40:00] few minutes

[1:40:48] again
[1:40:51] he said now one day you'll have a
[1:40:53] patient like that
[1:40:56] and he said i told y'all before you

[1:41:00] he was a picture of health
[1:41:03] he's seeing what god sees
[1:41:06] he's a picture of health but he's the
[1:41:09] sickest man in this clinic
[1:41:10] that's what the devil sees
[1:41:16] and he said one day you'll have patience
[1:41:18] like that and you'll
[1:41:20] miss something that they really need
[1:41:21] help with
[1:41:26] and he and then he made this statement

[1:42:44] things right here so lay aside your
[1:42:46] petty things

[1:42:58] [Applause]
[1:43:03] oh brother ronnie but if i had your
[1:43:05] position boy i'd do a lot of things just
[1:43:08] do what you got to do
[1:43:10] in your position where god called you
[1:43:13] don't try to take somebody else's job
[1:43:16] that you're not called to do to start
[1:43:18] off with
[1:43:19] overcome

[1:43:35] news for you i can't hold you back
[1:43:39] it ain't my job to hold you back but i'm

[1:43:51] things in my life
[1:43:53] i've fought through dark shadows i've
[1:43:55] thought through storms
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:02] i refuse for my epitaph to read all that
[1:44:05] i've been through
[1:44:08] i'm standing because of who god called
[1:44:11] me to be
[1:44:31] ephesians chapter 6 is another
[1:44:33] prescription
[1:44:35] that you take on the whole armor of god
[1:44:38] and there's nothing for your back it's
[1:44:40] all for your front
[1:44:44] so let me just say this to you charge
[1:44:51] charge
[1:45:00] charge
[1:45:04] brother ron the devil is trying to take
[1:45:05] my life

[1:45:26] just say this you
[1:45:27] he can't take your life
[1:45:30] until god gives him permission
[1:45:36] and your purpose on this earth is done
[1:45:39] before god gives permission
[1:45:41] for him to take your life but if you've
[1:45:44] still got something to do
[1:45:46] the devil can send his whole envoy
[1:45:51] north korea thinks they got an army the
[1:45:53] demons of hell can send all their
[1:45:56] envoy and god is greater on the inside
[1:45:59] of a little hundred pound woman
[1:46:01] than all the demons that are in hell
[1:46:22] oh dear jesus
[1:46:26] know you not that they which run in a
[1:46:30] race run off
[1:46:32] but one receiveth the prize
[1:46:38] so run
[1:46:41] that she may obtain
[1:46:45] don't run like somebody else run with
[1:46:48] what god gave you to do
[1:46:53] i want to be like this guy and i want to
[1:46:55] be like this woman and i want to be like
[1:46:56] that
[1:46:57] just be yourself look down at your
[1:47:00] fingerprints
[1:47:02] god built you just like he built you he
[1:47:05] gave you eyes just like he built your
[1:47:07] eyes he gave your hands just like he
[1:47:09] built your hands
[1:47:10] he gave you your nature just like he
[1:47:12] built you nobody can do like you do
[1:47:16] but god gave you an armor for the inside
[1:47:18] of you
[1:47:19] that the devil cannot defeat
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:37] remember who you are
[1:47:42] remember who you are
[1:47:47] our prophet brought the seven seals back
[1:47:52] to give them to us
[1:47:56] this was now the lamb's work
[1:48:02] the church could not tolerate
[1:48:05] this diet
[1:48:09] but there would be a people on the earth
[1:48:11] around the world
[1:48:13] that could tolerate it that would
[1:48:16] actually give their life
[1:48:18] for it and would stand in some very
[1:48:22] strugglesome if that's a word situations
[1:48:28] but because god had deposited something
[1:48:31] on the inside
[1:48:33] that only this message would work for
[1:48:35] them
[1:48:39] it didn't matter to abraham what lot
[1:48:42] said
[1:48:43] it didn't matter what the mayor said
[1:48:46] or what the the superintendent said
[1:48:50] what melchizedek told abraham would
[1:48:53] change his body
[1:48:56] what this ministry has done i'm not
[1:48:58] talking about mine but part of it but
[1:49:00] let me just say
[1:49:01] what the ministry of this day has done
[1:49:04] for this generation
[1:49:09] to turn your hearts
[1:49:14] to turn your heart to turn your passion
[1:49:20] what others
[1:49:23] could not stand it changed your life
[1:49:31] and i'm going to come to an end today
[1:49:33] maybe i'll pick it up next sunday is
[1:49:35] that okay
[1:49:40] what changed your life
[1:49:43] what changed your life
[1:49:49] what turned you same bible
[1:49:54] some of the same scriptures
[1:49:58] but under the right inspiration
[1:50:01] under the right anointing in the right
[1:50:04] atmosphere
[1:50:06] your life just changed
[1:50:11] your life just changed
[1:50:14] for many of those patients that were
[1:50:16] standing brother shannon
[1:50:19] with brother branham
[1:50:24] they were there they walked up sick they
[1:50:27] had cancer
[1:50:31] maybe blind but they walked up into an
[1:50:36] atmosphere
[1:50:40] and in a few moments
[1:50:43] they were not sick anymore
[1:50:50] literally in a few moments just two
[1:50:53] seconds really
[1:50:55] they went from being a cancer patient
[1:50:57] dying
[1:50:58] with a veil over them to live
[1:51:02] decades cancer-free
[1:51:07] or seeing sometimes that's what you come
[1:51:10] to church to do
[1:51:11] and you come to church and the devil has
[1:51:14] oppressed you
[1:51:15] and he's held you into bondage changed
[1:51:18] you
[1:51:19] men did incredible things to you in a
[1:51:22] matter of a few
[1:51:24] minutes you walk out and go
[1:51:28] i'm not the same person
[1:51:32] i i can't explain this but
[1:51:36] i'm i'm not the same person that i was
[1:51:40] when i walked in here
[1:51:45] what a powerful thing sometimes you're
[1:51:48] looking for a lightning bolt
[1:51:51] sometimes you're listening for thunder
[1:51:54] sometimes you're expecting the building
[1:51:56] to be shook
[1:51:58] and he comes like a still small voice
[1:52:05] and he just changes your life
[1:52:09] and you're just you're never the same
[1:52:13] you're never the same well brother ron
[1:52:16] can you give me some
[1:52:18] examples georgia carter
[1:52:24] hattie wright
[1:52:28] sister branham as herself
[1:52:34] even the prophet he suffered every
[1:52:37] every seven years with a condition and
[1:52:39] he was standing
[1:52:40] and he was standing and it just left him
[1:52:45] are you with me brother ron what's these
[1:52:48] services like
[1:52:49] sunday sunday after sunday and it seems
[1:52:52] like the angel lord's visiting
[1:52:54] he's doing business here
[1:52:58] he's doing business here and what you
[1:53:01] don't realize
[1:53:02] is cell after cell is dying in the
[1:53:05] preacher's
[1:53:06] body
[1:53:08] [Applause]
[1:53:10] because darkness cannot stay where
[1:53:13] light is
[1:53:20] so just as the moon shines in the
[1:53:24] darkness
[1:53:25] and darkness covers the earth
[1:53:28] come warning
[1:53:33] that light comes up over the hill and
[1:53:35] begins to glisten
[1:53:36] it disperses every drop of darkness
