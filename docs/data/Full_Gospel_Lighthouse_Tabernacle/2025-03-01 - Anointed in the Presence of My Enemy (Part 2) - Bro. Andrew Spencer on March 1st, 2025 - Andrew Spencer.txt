name father we come before you your people Lord we are named by the most name Holy Name there is the name of Jesus Christ Lord we're not ashamed of that name there's a lot of people that might be ashamed to speak the name of Jesus but some point in their life they're going to have to call on that name and while I'm here and got breath in my lungs I will speak the name that is above every other name I will claim victory in the name of Jesus I claim healing in the name of Jesus I Proclaim that there is no God like the God and he's high and lifted up you're the god that we will welcome in this place tonight and we ask Lord that you would come tonight and you would bless us according to your riches and Grace now father your people have come here tonight many have traveled for quite a little bit of ways Lord and Lord there's some that live very close that maybe didn't have to put that much en energy into getting here but still the same the sacrifice is worthy and I pray father that you would see them Lord Jesus and that you would pour out a special blessing on every IND individual father Lord we have put our times in study we have sought your face we have Sanctified ourselves and we're asking father that thy Holy Spirit would have his will in this service tonight now I pray God that you would just be blessed tonight and we pray all these things in the name of Jesus amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Book of Psalms chapter 23 and acts chap 4 in verse one a little bit muffled here brother brother Adam man just like to uh piggyback just a little bit off of last weekend's thought there on anointed in the presence of thine enemies of course very familiar with us and sometimes you you go through things and sometimes you look at things in a new way and it just seems like the Lord begins to illuminate scriptures that you've read over your entire life and I just love how the Lord sends inspiration at certain seasons and certain times and I believe he's mindful of every single one of us tonight amen Psalms chapter 23 and let's start at verse one the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want I always I've always been this has one of been one of my favorite scriptures but I I never fail it never fails me to realize how precious this quote and this scripture is to us whether we can quote it by heart or not it's so amazing how David makes this so personal not just to David but to every one of us that we can say the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yet though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever acts 4 and verse 1 amen let's say blessed be the name of the lordess and as they spake unto the people the priest and the captains of the temple and the Sadducees Came Upon them being grieved that they taught the people and P and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead and they laid hands on them and put them in the hold until the next day for it was now even tied how be it many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about 5,000 I think that's powerful right there that one scripture we could preach all night from that but it's amazing how some believed and how some turned it down but it is amazing that no matter who you are doesn't matter what you how you view the scripture election is ction there are some people that are going to hate the gospel and there are some that are going to just receive it as it is and receive eternal life and it came to pass that on the tomorrow that their rulers and their elders and scribes and ananas the high priest and caiaphus and John and Alexander And as many as were of the Kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this and then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and Elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent Man by what means he has made whole be it known unto all you all and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus of Christ over Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole there's the witness of it right there you can argue about Jesus being dead you can argue about him being being alive you can argue about about the power that but you the witness is the Vindication is standing right there that's the Vindication that that Jesus was alive because an impotent man was standing there completely whole I'll be honest with you there's a lot of people that can say a lot of things about the message of the hour but I'll just say this that I'm a witness that Jesus is the power that raises from the dead he said now he said this is a stone which was set at not of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other there is no other name under Heaven given amongst men whereby we must be saved and when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord and we realize that as Christians that that we are going to often be put in these kind of situations that make us feel very uncomfortable in our emotions and even in our physical flesh there are going to be times that are just maybe unpleasant to us but the matter of the fact it doesn't it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what we are going to go through but it it I say it like this we have got to stand in in good times and we've got to stand whether we are facing the most hardest and and and obstru obstacles we we realize that that we're going to come against some things and we're going to be faced by an enemy that is relentless on tearing us down but knowing in all of these things that we are covered by a power that we realize that that we are under a Psalms 91 of a Angelic Covenant that we realize that that we are dwelling in the secret place of the most high God and that we are covered by his very presence now the thing to me is so so Illuminating is that Jesus told his dis deciples that what we have just read in Acts three and acts 4 that these things were going to come to pass that that when you come before the the heads of the synagogues and the magistrates and the powers that be at mine don't take no thought what you're going to say but the holy spirit will literally take what he will take and put it in your mouth what things you're going to say so you don't have to study out what you're going to say when you come up against critics and when you come up against anointed ones at the end time but I believe that innocent is always willing to be questioned innocence is always willing to be questioned and a believer that is constantly that is standing for the truth will actually Rejoice at the opportunity to give a witness of the evidence that makes him a Believer I'd say that you could put you could put any of us in a corner and we could stand there and say I'm a witness that God still saves and God still delivers and I believe that if that if it comes from a a Vindicated experience of the Holy Ghost you're not ashamed and you're not afraid of whether you had to stand up in court and talk about the power of Jesus Christ or whe they had to do it down at Walmart now these men had never been to no Seminary they they hadn't studied out the scriptures like like a lot of people but they had been raised in it and they were around it all their life but the greatest thing is that they were with the author for three and a half years while he was walking now these men never went to no Seminary the Bible said that they were ignorant and unlearned and I can identify with them just right there and it makes me it makes me real happy to realize that that God can use somebody like Peter and John and I I'll say if he can use somebody like that that didn't even know how to sign their own name surely he's got some there's some hope for me and I I think it's a beautiful thing that they were living in the wealth of overflow of an anointing that was upon their life and I I think if I could say anything that I would want to be said about me that that men would Marvel that that that that that he didn't have the greatest education but they could say this that he'd been with Jesus and I believe that as my greatest greatest thing that I want people to recognize about me it's not about it's not about singing it's not about where I've been in life it's not about where I'm going in life but I just want people to take notice that I've been with Jesus and if I've been with Jesus it doesn't matter what I come up against I know the same power that stood there and thwarted the enemy 2,000 years ago is the same power that will anoint us to stand in the presence of our enemies I think it's a powerful thing when you can stand there in the face it's a it's a beautiful thing when you can stand there and relate to brothers and sisters of how great God's been to you but when you can stand there in the presence of your enemy and still say God's been a good God to me God's been a I tell you I went through hell I went through high waters I went through all the tmos but I say God's still a good God to me come on somebody I don't care what critic comes against the Church of the Living God we ought to be able to stand up there and be a witness that God's a good god well you might get sick and you might die but I'll say this that God's still a Healer you might have infirmities and God may not touch you but I'll say that God still gives Miracles out today well blessed be the name of the Lord now now we I read this to you last week and and just use it as a reference to draw a point when brother Randon preaches on the reproach for the cause of the word brother brandom draws that from Psalms 89- 51 that wherewith thine anointed or thine enemies have reproached oh Lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointing now now if you've listened to that uh if you've listened to that tape in in in a little while you you're very you're very familiar with this scripture or this quotation that I'm getting ready to make you remember that brother brandham is told by the angel of the Lord that there's a trap that is set before him and there's a trap that's coming now brother Brandon was anticipating that and different ways and he didn't understand it but when he goes to the meeting you remember that there was there was there was a a a young couple that was sitting there and there was making love right in the audience and this was the Trap that was set before him that's now I know that we've got a different uh uh diagram of people that are sitting here and and young people but that's the way the prophet said it so I'll just say it the way Prophet said it but they were making love right there and he said they were in my hands he said that was a trap he said now they were in my hands I could have done anything I wanted to do with them right there I could have called for death and death would have struck them he said but I literally looked on them and said I forgive you I forgive you now now this is what I'd like to just want to draw your attention to brother random said now what would you do with the power he said I I he said I believe that all things had a meaning he said but what would you do with the power how would you the reaction of an action he said something is come and act then how do you react to that that action I it's very easy to blow off at to handle it at anything but how do you handle it it's easy it's easy to go along with the flow when everybody is is for you and they're they're standing on your side but when they when you're in the middle of rejection and you and you have this power in your hand would you would you the one that's talked about you and the one that's criticized you could you have the ability to say I forgive you and I no matter what you do I'll love you what would you do with that kind of power and he said now you always stand he said you'll always have to stand this reproach in order to give to your testing to see every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose I got to lose this for the purpose that God has ordained for you he said and remember if you can just keep quiet I I know that's tough man I I know what kind of people are sitting here tonight yeah I know I know I there's a whole another section back there about third quarter way back there I tell you what and they on my side and remember if you can just keep quiet help me Jesus remember if he has called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening there's not enough devils in torment but what God's word will be made manifest you are born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place God's word will Triumph it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that the trials will come and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose God has a purpose and it'll all work out all right you mean to tell me that God's Got Your Troubles in his hands that God's got the critics in his hands that God's got the things that you are facing in his hands so many times we as human beings we want to take this battle into our own courts bring it over here but if we can just be quiet set still and realize that we were called for a purpose that we were anointed for a purpose to stand Toe to Toe and sometimes speak and sometimes be quiet ah what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying I want to live so close to him I want to live so close to him that he could express his power through me I want to walk like Enoch I want to pray like Daniel I want to sing like David I want to dance like Miriam I want to change like Sarah I want to shout like Joshua I want to ride on my Chariot like Elijah and I want to live like Jesus the Bible said in 1 John 2 and 27 but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you now I'm getting ready to take you through just a a few portions of of Bible characters and the anointing would come on them and the anointing would leave them but you it's different but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is the truth and is no lie even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him the anointing would come on Moses and the anointing would leave Moses Moses was still had a temper but the difference in your life is that you had a temper but God took that temper and turned it towards the word of God so that now take God takes that temper where you would have flew off at the handle he now takes and puts scriptures in your mouth and you have a new power a new adversity in your lips I'm saying that against all opposition that God will exalt you that no matter I think it's powerful when you begin to think about Joseph that Joseph was exalted right in front of his betrayers I find it amazing that when Joseph brings forth children and he calls one Ephraim he said now now I've received this child that God has turned my Affliction in the land that I was put in you think about how Joseph could stand there and him be exalted and his brothers had to visibly watch the anointing Place him in power you want to talk about releasing potentials Joseph was put in a pit and he was raised out of that pit and he was put up there in Poor's house they took him out of Poor's house when he wouldn't sin and they took him over there and put him in a prison he stood there in a prison and no matter what they put Joseph through he was blessed and then when somebody remembered that there was a Joseph in the land he was raised to second in power right in the face of the opposition God will exalt you and prove the anointing is upon your life just like with the three Hebrew children I think it's beautiful brother Matthew's singing about it tonight he's singing about it tonight but it's a is a very powerful thing when you realize that in the face of opposition they didn't pray they didn't pray that the fire would go out they didn't pray that the king would change his mind they just stood there and they obeyed almighty God they didn't bow the knee they stood there and said no matter what I will not bow down to Le oosa I'll tell you that the anointing that is upon your life will be seen by the outside world it was three men down there but the visible the invisible son of man the invisible came the visible and the anointing the anointing was so visible that no matter the fire you're going through the anointing is there well I I got a little bitty trial going on I'll say the anointing still there I got one of the greatest trials I'm going through the anointing is still there the anointeth abideth in you and shall be in you the Bible said in judges 13-25 that the spirit of the Lord speaking about Samson begin to move at him move him at times in the camp of Dan between zor and esah so the scripture is showing us that Samson strength and purpose were not of his own making but they were stirred by the Holy Spirit by the Lord when you begin to study that word move in this verse first it suggests a Divine agitation a Divine agitation when God gets upset that's one thing when I got my corner on my side and they get agitated but when God gets agitated you know that Samson was born for a purpose to destroy the Philistines and that the spirit of the Lord would divinely agit divinely agitate Samson in such a way that God would awaken the anointing that was within him he was raised for this purpose he was just walking down the road one day and a line came out and the Bible said that he didn't have nothing in his hands but he destroyed it with his bare hands it gives you encouragement to know whether you're with whether you got the rod in your hand or whether you don't you've got a power you've got an anointing come on somebody he had an anointing this line that is coming to steal to kill and destroy you have to take the word of God in your anointing when opposition Rises unexpectedly I mean on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday are you with me God's anointing will give you a supernatural strength to overcome the threats whether you see it coming or whether you don't there's countless times when the anointing of the Lord would come upon Samson but you remember when his brothers took a new spirit and they begin to bind him something that he hadn't been bound with before they took a new spirit new cords and they begin to bind him with it and when Samson come into the camp of the Philistines and they shouted against him the Bible said that the spirit of the Lord began to anoint him and they begin to break that the anointing begin to break the bonds that was upon his life like flax in a fire it begin to burn up I so I say it like this the anointing that's on your life that when the enemy tries to bind you with a new spirit a new complex a new power a new idea a new ideology that the anointing that is upon your life will break the power of the enemy I say it like this that that that Samson didn't know what he was grabbing a hold of but he this wretch over there and grabbed a hold of a jawb of an ass and began to beat down a thousand Philistines so God's anointing not only set you free but God's anointing takes ordinary things and makes powerful weapons out of them Hallelujah well you say all I got a little sling in my hand David put it to work all I got a little Jawbone all I've got is maybe a thread in my corner but I say put the anointing to work Let it Loose let take what you got and let God do something with it ah come on somebody I'd have probably been like that little chubby guy brother Matthew was talking about last week and carrying a lunch with him Mama always made sure that we had a little extra in there just in case just in case we got a little extra hungry or we need to feed somebody else that was with us and didn't have something something to eat I'd have probably been like that guy it didn't seem like much but it sure was a whole lot to when Jesus got a hold of it I say your life may not seem like a whole lot but when God gets a hold of it is there anybody willing to say God get a hold of me a Divine agitation just like a fire needs to be stirred to make it harder the Holy Spirit begin to stir Samson and in his final Victory he kills more Philistines in one act he's blinded he's weak and he looks like he's without God but even in your weakness God can send an anointing on your life to anoint you to destroy more devils and what would seem to be your destruction I said no matter how weak you are no matter how strong you are no matter what case or what condition that you are in I said let the spirit of God like it moved out upon the face of the water and begin to wake up seeds I said let the spirit of God move on you like it moved on on men of old when the spirit of God would they would be moved by the Holy Ghost to write down scriptures I said let the Holy Ghost flow through your life let God anoints you you said well brother ROM said one time he said well I said I he said now I it's Pentecostal people out there and people say well I don't understand why they act the way they act I don't understand why they shout like they shout he said how can it be how can it be of the Lord when they sit there and kick them tables over kick chairs over knock the windows out he said I tell you what it is he said it's a holy ghost he said well surely you don't mean that's a holy ghost he said absolutely it's a holy ghost He said but it's like a train going down the track he said it's got that steam in the engine and it just blows it right out he said but he said that's the way them people are he said they got to let the steam out he said at least they got a little bit of steam so don't make fun of nobody just because you don't understand how it's a holy ghost why you think they need to be active brother brandom said what they need to do is put that steam to action he said get it running down in the valves and make the wheels roll he said then you'll see signs then you'll see wonders then you'll see Miracles I say F go pogh house don't let the steam just come out of your mouth put the mechanics that Dynamics through the mechanics and let it flow come on Samson once more Lord once more let it flow through me Rebecca when it come to her time of decision when she heard the message and it meant something to her and she said I'm going to go with you but her mother and her brother Mother random said like a typ of the church tried to hold her back here I said let's whe let's see whether when we get on the other side of this revival whether if it's real or not let's just wait till it's over to see brother Mar said I got very much I've got very little faith in somebody that can that can say let's wait tomorrow before I make a decision he said but the message of the hour had sted Rebecca the Angel's message had stirred her in such a way that the message that she heard about Isaac had satisfied her I say that what we've heard about our ISAC has satisfied me this message has stirred me it's stir I tell you what I could fight through a thousand Philistines I could climb over a thousand hills because this message has satisfied me well you too worked up no sir you ain't seen nothing yet this message has stirred my innermost being you say well we can talk about days of Miracles going by oh no I say there's more coming I say it's more power I say it's more anointing I say we got more challenges but we got more victories I know it's a paradox it's a paradox to be standing in the hour that we're living in where the presence of almighty God is moving moving out upon the face of the waters and making voices come alive to speak the same thing that he's saying I know I I know that it's incredible but it's true that right here in the face of all they to see that there's a people that refuse to give in they refuse to give up they refuse to bow down to any Spirit come on somebody any spirit I say you're anointed to conquer sickness I say you're anointed for it I say you're anointed to defeat complexes you're anointed for it I say you're anointed to uh to conquer fear I I believe that you're anointed for it I believe that that yes it is incredible but it's true that you could be fellowshipping with the same one that your Prophet was Fellowship with it's incredible but it's true that that same power that was standing there in 1950 at Houston Coliseum Coliseum that same power is right here the same enemy that was standing there in 1950 is standing here right now it's challenging the message of the hour it's challenging whether you believe it or not it's challenge whether you're going to go all the way or not it's a challenge but I say every time you challenge God God shows up what are you saying brother Angel I'm saying don't fight your battles let God fight for you don't you debate with him brother Bosworth let God do the talking I'll tell you what there's a lot of Ministries that we could look at there's a lot of men that had had the phenomena in their Ministry but there was only one that had a Vindication like this one come on somebody there was a lot of people that produced Miracles a lot of men of God and I I thank God for for him I do you look at the world they're still feeding off of Billy Graham's Ministry they're still riding on this coattail today and I believe people are getting saved under it but ain't none of them got the Vindication of Malachi 4 that could stand there could stand there and know exactly what that seven seal was know exactly what they what it was standing there to look at the enemy i' say that these things it's the Antichrist it's amazing but it's true it's amazing that you could take what we people would say today is is a 70y old religion well he's been dead and gone about 70 years now why you still listen to him same old tapes well I just happen to believe it is that they're rapturing faith that comes off them tapes and gets on a people that stimulates him so for me it ain't just a tradition it ain't just to listen to a man that's dead that message didn't come from Kentucky and it didn't come from Indiana that message came from glory and that message will anoint you in the presence of your enemies now I'm I'm coming to something another man I'm sitting now when God moves in a supernatural your heart will hunger right to it again he would say an expectation he said everywhere God moves and anytime Through the Bible you'll see healing and miracles and signs and wonders he leaves a track behind him of the supernatural I don't care what theologians say the Bible's right amen let the brothers say let the sister say the Bible's right when God moves the World shakes God ain't surprised God ain't upset I tell you what God didn't fall apart in the Garden of Eden surely he's not going to fall apart in Satan's Eden I say you're predestinated to make it you going to live it you're going to go through it it might get hard it might be it might go through some things that you don't want to go through but you going to make it look at your neighbor say I'm going to make it I might have come out of the hills of West Virginia but I'm going to make it I might have come out of the hills of Kentucky but I'm going to make it I might have come out of the hills of Virginia but I'm going to make it I may have come out of Canada but I'm going to make it I'm going to make it I'm a win I'm an overcomer I'm going to win I'm going to make it and I say there's only one way and it's a message of the hour [Applause] amen what are you saying brother Angel I'm saying you're anointed to fulfill your destiny there's 100 million ways I want to go but I'm just following the leadership of the Lord right here you remember when when in Numbers Chapter 20 that that the that they'd come into a spot and God had took care of his children the Bible said the when they come to the desert of Zen that sin that they they stood there and the Bible said in numbers 20 that they had no water there and you're talking about getting people upset they was upset they wanted to kill the guy that got them out of the mess in in the first place and they come against him with threatening and the Bible went on to say that that that Moses and Aaron ran with fear back to the tent of the Lord and laid down and begin to in fear begin to talk to the Lord about about these things and they laid there and the Bible said and the angel of the Lord and the Lord appeared unto them and said say unto them take Moses take your rod and speak to the rod speak to the Rock and the Bible said that and his Waters came for it matters where the wat's coming for him this is his water you see no matter where they went Paul said in 1 Corinthians and 10 he said no matter where they went that rock follow them and that rock was Christ I'm going to tell you what it's going to be something powerful to be able to water two million people you remember when brother Mar talk he said now he said that car mine that put painted that little picture a little bit little bit of water trinkling out that rock he said he said that guy was false he said ain't no way he said but this is a Guster come out of there he said cuz it was enough to water two million people and all their beasts and all their animals so when you come up against opposition God will Pro provide in the worst of conditions God will provide for you I I say this all you got to do is speak to the rock you speak to rock well I tell you what I'm up against it well I I tell you it's it's amazing when in Exodus 14 that he says why you crying unto me speak and go forward he comes to number 20 said just speak to the Rock You know the disciples got into a place one time where they were all look up because of the storm that they was in and they realized that The Rock was sitting back there in the bow of the boat and it began to speak to him I say this if you need peace speak to the Rock if you need Joy speak to the Rock if you need healing speak to the Rock come on somebody speak to it now now any of you I'm going to jump right here but any of you that know have studied a little bit I know brother Denny few of us here few others and some of our older people still might even remember some of these things but brother Brandon would talk about that Mad Dog bot that they would that there was old folklore that they said that if You' get that that mad rock that if you take it if if you really studied out it it's a hair ball comes from a white tail deer and real porous and they believe that if you could take that rock it become so hard that they they they they believe that if you if you got bit by a rabbit dog or or if you got bit or by some kind of poisonous creature that you could take that stone and you could lay it on that wound and if that if that stone would stay there then then it would draw the literal the disease right out of you that a that ain't too crazy is it now you sisters y'all got hair balls God has blessed you and we find this us Brothers find them everywhere and it's amazing to me that our sister SS can still have all that hair on their head I don't know why two weekends a row I'm talking about hair last time it was in our food and this time we're putting it on our wounds Lord where are you taking me to next weekend I'm going to preach on keeping your hair long I don't have to do that here thank God you know what the scripture said I say thank God I'll preach on if I have to but anyway you know what I'm saying but they literally they it ain't too crazy people still take onions a day and put it on their wounds try to drw the very por and right out off wo God help me my brother bam said now let me say it like this he said the worst mad dog that I know about is a devil he's got a bad bite he said but oh if you can just lean on the Rock of Ages he said no matter what the situation is no matter if you're sicking a wheelchair lying out there in a cot just Lan on the Rock I say put the Rock up against your bosom and let him satisfy your soul come on somebody just hang on to the Rock let it produce the supernatural it'll pull this Rock of Ages will pull every disease of sin right out of you I I I was just studying away and I I was going a completely different way in my studies and the spirit of the Lord just dealt with me to go this way this evening and I just want be real sensitive to the Lord because I realize that we are we've been facing an enemy here at Full Gospel Lighthouse and ain't just us it's every every believer but we've been going through some big battles here and and I was just in my study and the Lord just kind of turned me here so I I'm just going to follow the lord and put these things in here if he let us here so we're here and remember man said now he said let us pray he said praise be to the Living God Dost thou now believe can you believe with all things what if I never said a word to you and just said that Jesus Christ makes you well would you believe it you would then go rejoice and be happy say thanks be to God what if I told you you would standing down

die they were starving in the city so if they went into the City and nothing could help them if they laid there they're still going to die they said we got one chance if we go down to the enemy the syrians they had besieged and said maybe they'll have Mercy on us he said but God in his Sovereign Mercy had mercy on them and their life was saved and not only that but they saved others the Bible said now you're laying in the same shape you're at the end of the road but you'll not have to go down to an enemy you're welcome at the father's table tonight you got one chance but you ain't got to go down to the enemy's Camp you are seated at the father's table I say eat your healing right off of the plate now come lady do you believe with all your heart as you're coming would you like to eat

you've crossed the line I'm calling at every demon right now I'm calling out every demon right now that says that you've crossed the line I want you to hear what a prophet has said you've practically been nervous your whole life you had a scary sort of that when you was just a little girl and now here I see you trying to do something that makes bad or something you get so nervous that you have to go sit down I love this but you've been praying but you've been praying you see Satan may have told you that you've crossed a line and you're going to have to deal with that the rest of your life but

the name of Jesus Christ you are healed you go home you are well amen have faith in God don't doubt believe every time when God goes to moving and starts to stirring there's a track of the Supernatural That's why brother brandham said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said that's what the devil's howling about is that this is being revealed what if I told you that the thing that was choking you is defeated would you believe me well don't believe me take what this word has said what if God would wake up in the morning God would wake you up in the morning and speak to you and tell you that your battles are over and that they're finished I got a question for you would you hear him and would you believe him all let me ask you a real question here if an audible voice talked to you and said you are healed would you stand there and wonder at it or would you say I believe that with all that's within me well let me let me just let me just give you an audible voice Isaiah 53 come on somebody you don't need somebody to speak it in the audience you don't need somebody to say it over your life he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the chastisement of my peace was upon and by his stripes I am healed there's your Audible Voice there it is you're healed go on your road believe it go on rejoicing you're anointed in the presence of

careful brother angrew you don't know where you're standing absolutely I do come on somebody I got the word of God on my side I got a Vindicated Prophet on my side I got your faith on my side I got my faith on my side I got God on my side God is not backing up just because you ain't seen it in a minute does it make it not real that's right just because you haven't felt the impulse of it in a little bit does it make it not true I say he's the same yesterday today and forever if a prophet would read from that scripture over 3,100 times he would quote that I say he's still the same I say he's God over cancer I say he's God over doubt I say he's God over every demon it's amazing is the theology Will Never Move a demon that demon will stay right there and he will antagonize you and he will swear at you and he'll cuss you he'll talk in your ear and make you believe all kinds of things theology will make him feel like he's welcome but when you start turning towards him and start preaching Mark 16 and you start preaching John 14 that demon starts get to get you get a little excited you remember when brother Bon would preaching the acts of the Holy Spirit he would stand there and he said now he said now when he said when the when the enemy would come in there he said that when he said he didn't even roll out of his bed he said when when they stood up there and preached on the day of Pentecost he said but when he went up there in Acts chapter 3 and the phenomena started happening he said the devil rode out of his bed right there he said because if the Phenom to get started right now he said I'll never get it stopped and he tried to stop it then he tried to put him in in prison he tried to shut them in jail he tried to shut them up he tried to hang them on the cross he never stopped the gospel then so he ain't going to stop it now because it's the same acts continuation of the book of Acts right here in this church I am a believer and I am anointed in the presence of my
