feed you some other things too and so what you don't like just lay it on the shelf don't make fun of it just just lay it on the shelf enjoy it and we won't preach you anything outside of the word of the lord and so that's what we believe that's what we're committed to this morning amen if you will turn with me to first timothy chapter 4 and verse 12. amen i would like to speak to you this morning and the lord has dealt with me over the last couple of weeks on this phrase in god's hands and in god's hands i think i think if we could come to the conclusion today we're very thrilled that we're in god's hands the reason this is so important to us today is because the world is in chaos world war iii is upon us if you can't see that the you're not paying attention every week there's an escalation of nuclear disaster israel is preparing for major conflict it's not getting a lot of attention in our in our media but there's a lot of conflict that is going on in israel they're fighting for their borders and yet at the same time in all of this chaos there's a bride that is in good shape and she stands around the world whether she's in ukraine or or wherever country that she's in god is making a way for her and in it all we are enjoying the refreshing of the presence of the lord last night we experienced a sweep of the holy spirit like like a new one i never quite seen like before recognizing it was the angel of the lord and and and listen don't never miss out on those things so we're watching what's happening if i could just say it like this we had a prophet that stood in two worlds at the same time and now there's a bride that stands in two worlds did you catch that at the same time amen first timothy chapter 4 and verse 12 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity now if you will turn with me to john chapter 20 and verse 24 i'll be standing for quite a while you can kind of relax your legs there for a minute john chapter 20 and verse 24 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord what a statement we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in it except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger in the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe and after eight days again the disciples were within and thomas said unto them and then jesus and then came jesus and the door shut and the door stood in the midst and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you and then he said to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god and jesus said unto him thomas because thou has seen me thou has believed now here's where you are blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed you may be seated i dare say that nobody told jesus that thomas is doubting amen i dare say that when jesus was in the room when jesus calls thomas out of all of those men and he tells him put your finger in my print he realized that jesus knew of a conversation a week ago thomas put your hand in my sight to see where that sword was thomas did and then thomas said my lord and my god and then jesus tells him blessed are you for you see but blessed are those that believe and they never get the opportunity to see last night i was i was sitting on the stage here and this came in my heart i've just been studying and pieces have been of the puzzle has come together sometimes we don't recognize that that every day is supernatural and that we as individuals here 2000 years later are in his hands though we don't see him and though we don't feel him and though that you know we're maybe not in a spiritual mode at the moment but we're in his hands there was a wreck that happened brother shannon and and brother greg was coming home from mckee and they came up on another wreck and they tried to avoid that wreck and they went flipping through the air destroying that jeep as i look back on it as i drive past that place it looks absolutely almost impossible of how they landed and how they didn't hit trees head-on or take the literally the whole lid off of that thing and and just kill them both in the moment it looked like angels took them up and laid them down i was sitting i was sitting in a chair later that night and i was just thinking on some things and i was i was reading in christ the mystery of god revealed and i came to a certain paragraph paragraph 71 brother branham says this he said he jesus should be the principle that's right we believe it don't we he said and if he is that then he should be the principal theme of our talking of our thinking of our singing of our walks and he should be the principal theme of our life and if he is the principal theme of our life and the bible is in us of the bible and the bible is in us he should be the principal thing theme of everything that we do or think everything should be christ now here's how here's how that worked out i sent that i clipped that and sent that to brother shannon and brother shannon immediately responded that's the last words i heard before our our jeep flipped in the air now you think of the odds of all of that of over almost 1200 books 1200 messages i'm reading the message that he was listening to in the jeep and i come to this certain paragraph and god speaks to me send that to brother shannon and it happens to be the words that was being spoken as they were flipping in the air and it's the last thing that they remember i think that we we should realize real quickly in all of our lives we're in his hands we're in his hands in him was all the fullness of god in him was the fullness of god and the fullness of the promise when we're baptized into him we have every promise that god made laid at our fingertips no sin is there no death is there and even sickness can't stay in his presence if satan then puts his hands on you and tries to tempt you into something you hold your token in your hands and show it that you're a redeemed product of jesus christ let your unadulterated faith wave that token there i am a product of jesus christ [Applause] the token is the word to identify you living itself out that's god's being his own interpreter the interpretation of the word lives in you it's a living word it's a living attribute i want to see god god's living in your life he says you don't have to say well well now you interpret my tongue that ain't it he interprets your life by the word and when he takes your word what you are and identify his word through there there don't need to be any interpretation it's already there god does his own interpretation and we have his promises for this day god's way of doing anything is speak the word and the word is the entire revelation of jesus christ nothing to be added to it nothing to be taken away from it whatsoever does it the bible says his part whosoever does it or takes away from her adds to it his part will be taken out of the lamb's book of life the bible doesn't need anybody to interpret it god is his own interpreter [Applause] [Music] now if we can say this about this this book what about our life god don't need our opinions he don't need our additional thoughts to it brother brown said now break to us the bread of life as we open back the pages of the word because we know that the bible is of no private interpretation god doesn't need us to interpret his life he is his own interpreter he said one day let there be and there was light he said behold a virgin shall conceive and she did i don't think none of us can argue with that they argued with it in that day and they may argue it to today but we believe her testimony we don't need a thousand people to crutch up our testimony if you have met god your life changed a lot of people meet religion and they have to vow and vow and vow and vow and cycle and cycle and cycle they get church entity or an intellectual conception but if you ever meet jesus if you ever having a personal experience there will never be no going back he said now in the bible if you turn i believe if i've i i believe if i've i've never had a message that i've i've tried to undertake to speak on that i've never first read the word because the word my word will fail i'm a man but his word can't fail he is god i believe we're all in agreeance with that if any bride is prepared we are brother ron but i'm facing so many issues he's prepared you to go through those things realize that we're standing in the darkest age that there's ever been but he's given you grace to get through this you need more than the hand of your father or your mother or your pastor you need the hand of jesus to guide you in the darkness because in the darkness there's a lot of there's a lot of imagination can go on in the darkness are you with me if you remember those little children in a cave and they were there and they cut the lights off and the little girl got all excited but their little brother said but there is a man there is a man here that can turn on the lights we're standing in the darkness of this age but the man has turned on the light i would say that god is up to the task he's absolutely up to the task to prepare us to get us ready for the rapture it'll be up to no man he didn't leave it up to a man with noah he told noah to get inside and god shut the door because noah as a man would have always been waiting on certain certain so and so but god shut the door and noah couldn't open the door moses as a man being the interpretation of god living in a human being moses as a man would have never went back down to egypt where he was humiliated as a young man but when he met that pillar of fire god put something in his hand sure we can talk about god creating the heavens and the earth and rolling the zodiac off of the fingertips or in revelations chapter 1 with him standing there with the angels in his right hand but god wants to use your hands he wants to use your feet [Applause] moses went back down before the greatest army and stood there and said who sent you here and he said i am that i am he went down as a one-man invasion amen a one-man invasion destroyed the whole army let me just recognize this setting where we're sitting at tonight that army of egypt was the strongest army in the world and god sent one man and putin can make a lot of boasts and he's got a lot of bombs and he will fulfill the word of god he will do that he will fulfill the word it's up to me and you to get ready for a rapture our job is to get ready for a rapture his job is to get ready to blow up america he'll do his job that goes out and it goes to the halls of washington i've stood in your oval office that's all i've also stood in the in the center of china's great great great places there and they're great governments none of those things impressed me i met a god that rolled the whole world off his and he has it in his hands brother aren't you concerned that somebody might get it and challenge you let me just say you had a prophet and that prophet told you that russia was going to bomb you and was going to blow america to bits because you turned the message down i want you to think about potentials that god puts inside of us maybe i'll strike your carnal side just for a moment in the kentucky derby just last week a two-year-old colt finished dead last in his last race disappointed his ain't his his owners placed him in a in a claiming race where any anybody could claim ownership of him for a fee an older man purchased the cold after missing the chance to claim another horse that he wanted he said it was his last attempt for some success in the racing industry the coat won by 17 wins his new owner was encouraged but in the races that followed he finished third twice fourth once fifth once his owner however still believed in him 2022 we come to it what's the cult's only chance to race in a major thoroughbred race which are limited to three-year-olds the day before the kentucky derby the field of horses was already full but then at the last moment a famous trainer scratched and withdrew his horse the coke took that place in the field of 20 horses just 30 seconds before the deadline suddenly he was in the game and he had a chance all the metrics all the predictors were against him neither was his owner his trainer nor his jockey had ever been associated with a horse in the kentucky derby they had no experience his jockey had never won a major event they were decidedly outsiders newbies in an extremely elite arena on the morning of the race his odds of winning were 80 to 1. the second longest odds in derby history halfway around the track the colt was 16 horses back from the lead he couldn't even be seen in the field of the view of the drone camera flying above the race he was a nobody he was a throwaway he was inconsequential participant at this point but then you just might as well smile but then he made his move he began to work his way through cancer he began to work his way through the trials of life i couldn't help but do that he began to work in his way through a crowded pack finding a few narrow fleeting opportunities to improve his position and as they headed toward the finish line he had miraculously moved to fifth then forth but still no one noticed him everyone's intention was firmly on the battle between the two famous front runners only seconds before the finish he suddenly almost magically passed those two front runners the announcer struggled to identify his name in time and almost in a single breath rich strike is coming up on the inside oh my goodness the longest shot has won the kentucky derby where there is life there is hope anything is possible don't let nobody count you out persistent and determination will beat all odds you may not be in the best starting position you may not be the biggest and the best horse you maybe only made it in the last 30 seconds you might have only been bought for 30 000 while all the others were multiple millions of dollar horses they may have never counted you in it ain't about to have out about having the best of everything or being the biggest or the favored it's about the size of the heart i thought you'd enjoy that we're against all odds but we're in his hands our challenge is to finish many quit many turn aside many have excuses many are not dedicated many are not committed but the scripture tells us to lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us this is believers this ain't drunks prostitutes and dope addicts this is people sitting in pews with pies and dresses on you got to lay aside every weight every excuse stay the course regardless of your challenges a man named glenn cunningham forgive me i'm just going to take some examples here was a young boy burned in a in a fire by a stove they literally decided the doctors decided we'll cut his legs off and he begged them don't cut my legs off he was burned so bad until his legs were not recognizable it was just meat sat in a wheelchair laid in the bed and he would inch his way out to the fence watch other children going backwards and forwards one day he had to strengthen the determination to grab a hold of the fence and pull himself up and stand this was a miracle this was a phenomenal germany from his seat to standing position day by day he began to teach himself to step one stepping aside moving backwards and forwards it wasn't long though he was walking it was set in his goal i want to be the fastest man in the world nobody would have gave him a chance if you're gonna look at the present circumstances you would have never gave him a chance that's a dream wake up but he had a vision i'm not just going to walk i'm not just going to be productive in my life but i'm going to be the fastest man in the world and glenn cunningham went into the olympics as a young man and competed and was the first man to get near a four-minute mile and begin classed as the fastest man in the world you never know where somebody's been at in their life until you've walked in their moccasins a little while beethoven is known to be one of the greatest composer and writers that are ever lived but beethoven became deaf and he saw the legs off of his piano and on a hardwood floor played and listened to the vibration of the music and composed he did not let deafness it may have drove him into isolation and he may never hear his music ever again in his life but there was a gift that was on the inside of him that he refused to quit and shut up somebody ought to be shouting right now [Applause] stephen hawkins is known to be one of the brightest men that ever lived stephen hawkins sit in a chair and it's computerized in every way he went into dno dna codes he went into outer space he actually discovered that there was a god much to the chagrin of the scientific community he discovered that god created the heavens and the earth amen just for a good note other great scientists if they were honest would say the same thing einstein was the name i was looking for he actually believed that god created the heavens and the earth but stephen hawkins didn't let his debilitating condition close him down he used the gift that was inside of him to try to better the world fanny crosby was blind yet there was a gift on the inside of her it was a gift to write music and she would be one of the greatest greatest gospel music writers in the history of time and here's where i start to preach and they made fun of her and they mocked her how will you know him fanny crosby she said i will know him by the nail prints in his hands she said i may have never seen the sun shine on this side of my life but i will appreciate it when i get there job had many trials cruel in many ways when god came to talk to him he did not talk to him about the trial that he was in god asked him where was you job when i spoke the word and i took my hands and i said let there be he could have talked to him about building mountains and building the caves and building the oceans and building all that he built he's going to talk to him about building all of the mountains that we would enjoy the deserts and building every situation of life he didn't come to give him a pity party he reminded him job you in my hands so no matter what trial that you have none of us has ever been in job's situation i've been called job i hope i'm not fallen off of a house 40 feet they said i would never walk again burned burned and laid to where that they were going to harvest my organs a month later and five hours from the harvest and of the organs i woke up a doctor would say to me god must have a great purpose for you and your life i would lay in the hospital with a stroke eight days and on the eighth night there was a nurse came in and she had a little light and she came in and she came around the bed and she said mr spencer have you been praying and i said yes ma'am she said i've not been your attending nurse but i've heard about you and she said when i walked through the door i felt a presence that i've never felt before in my life said were you praying i said i was praying i said do you know him she said i don't know him and in a few moments i led that lady to the lord jesus christ and all stroke conditions left and i went home the next day you see we're instruments in the hands of god we may be battled with the road to hell is paved with good intentions we may be battle with complacency and getting common in life we made battle with neglecting to do the right thing we may battle with procrastination i'll

hands has a little value but a basketball in the hands of michael jordan a golf club in my hands has absolutely no value as brother ted would say baloney but in the hands of tiger woods he makes more money with advertisements than he ever did on a tour an artist brush in my hands will draw stick figures be of little value but at the hands of da vinci a baseball bat in my hands will get you foul balls but in the hands of shaytani just to give you an idea i do keep up he just hit a hundredth home run last night i just checked just for good measure in his hands it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars a guitar a drum a piano all instruments in the hands of in the book of psalms but in many churches they're not welcome [Music] this is a church to where that we worship the lord this is a church where we lift up our voices and worship god don't let it scare you don't let it scare you people go to ball games and scream and holler [Applause] and there's no value to that to not tomorrow

me [Applause] and yet you will let the devil whisper in your ear when you walk into church when god saved you and he healed you and he raised you up and you're still standing today in the most wicked age that there's ever been when nobody gave you a chance you're in god's hands hallelujah [Applause] the other day i was told by doctors seems like every day i'll get a request how are you doing the other day i was told by doctors you have still as much cancer as you've ever had you're still on the same amount of chemo but we're real happy with what however you're doing you're one of a kind we didn't go home and cry and go to bed put a pillar over top of our head and say well we haven't diminished a cell of this cancer not a cell that's been gone or destroyed we've had prayers from around the world cards from around the world gifts from around the world but in god's hands i'm going to preach to you in god's hands i've dedicated and committed the rest of my life to destroying the works of the devil as long as he gives me strength and health i will stand here and stand around the world and preach the gospel of jesus christ don't bring me your excuses i'll speak to those on the internet you may be lazy worthless feel entitled grown-up brats [Music] you've never accomplished anything in your life but you can sit behind a computer and criticize me get up off your couch and go

real deep breaths in whether you realize or not is taking in a deep breath actually relaxes your whole body you know what i do before i walk to this stage i take in multiple deep breaths trying to take care of all the nerves that i've got going on now what happens in this church sometimes is there's people out there that begin to take in deep breaths and they relax their entire body some of you get it today some of you get it tomorrow joseph was re actually living the life of jesus moses was actually living the life of jesus he nowhere ever stepped out over the red sea and said i'm portraying jesus christ he's going to come like a prophet unto me nope he didn't say it as a matter of fact he said god you can let us die god can help us here and god simply said why are you crying out to me stretch that which is in your hand paraphrase it now stretch that which was in your hand out over the sea god didn't send a lightning bolt he asked him to use what he had in his hand that's what god's asking us to do today he's gave you the best word he's gave you the best message he has equipped you with the best tools that he can give you [Applause] for reference noah preached 120 years and he won eight souls by most people's standard eight people in their church is not a big church but if you look at the previous church it was eight times bigger than enoch walking off so eight was quite sizable noah never had no training on ship building he was a farmer he did not have the best wood to work with but that was what god chose for him no architects was set up to art to set us up as an adventure for him to build no doubt people thought at the end of the journey well noah's building that's a zoo noah had maybe if god told him said now noah i'm going to give send in and i'm going to get you together two by two all the animals of the earth can you imagine what a job that would have been if you think god can't take care of you he can gather animals from all over the earth 2x2 i got a note the other day it says you think you're having a bad day you're the third champ chimpanzee on the way to the ark and baby it's starting to rain it's good aunt cake thank you how do i feed them how do we eat god's gonna flood the whole earth never seen any kind of destruction like this all i was told he didn't tell his children he didn't tell his wife god told him and he explained it to him and he preached from that text for 120 years people get really bored with sermons i've heard that before i've heard that before but can you imagine being in noah's pastorship and no matter where he started out he ended up it's gonna rain and you borderline believers you're going to you're going to die and as a matter of fact if you're not on the ark you're going to hell i imagine that made some social circle upsets if you ain't in our church you're going to hell but it wasn't his words it was god's words don't argue with me i'm just a preacher this morning i had three eggs two pieces of bacon and a piece of ham it was good my job to preach to you three hebrew children refused to bend and bow they were in god's hands i won't be much longer but stay with me shamgar had 600 men that repetitively came and stole all of his crops but left him just a little bit but something happened to him today and there was about an eight-foot stick with a stone on one end and a spear on another he was a farmer but something struck him i don't need ten thousand at my side all i need is god let me just say this you you don't have to eat the whole elephant just one bite at a time you don't have to kill 600 at one time just one at a time but when you're done 600 men will be dead a little boy was holding a blind man and the blind man had been a mighty man but today they were going to make a sport out of him and that little boy was holding this man's hands and he heard a lot about from mom and daddy who his man was no doubt he had been one of the little boys that had watched other children spit on him while he was working in the mill in the town center because they made fun of him this man had carried gates on his shoulder this man had killed a lot of people this man had took a jawbone of an ass and destroyed a thousand men and today this blind man his his hair had grown back out he looked horrible but his hair had grown back out but somewhere in the silence of that grinding of that meal i wish i could preach to you right now somewhere in the grinding of your meal while you're going in circles and circles around the revolution of that meal that satan thinks he's got you bound to why don't you have a prayer meeting why don't you have a prayer meeting that'll shake the shingles off of the roof why don't you decide i'm done with this devil i'm going to give god the rest of the days of my life and i'm going to do it with all my heart i'm done with excuses i'm done i'm done i'm done with my weakness god if you give me the strength i'm gonna push and i'm gonna push [Applause] and he put his hands he said if you would just show me the pillars that this building stands on if you could just put me there i don't know i don't know i don't know what happened that little boy but somewhere god's got a place for that little boy maybe you can tell me later what happened that little boy but i don't know i don't know i read the bible a whole lot and i've always wondered about that little boy but if you were ever in god's mind you will always be in god's mind if you were ever in god's mind you will always be in god's mind he put his hands on the pillars and he had a prayer meeting and he could hear him making fun of him and against all odds he knew he was in god's hands he knew today is my last day on earth so if today's my last day on earth oh i feel like preaching if today is my last day on earth let me kill more today than i've ever killed in my whole life and he began to push and a well-constructed building disintegrated oh yeah in god's hands can you give me can you give me two more minutes i've been giving this a lot of thought a lot of thought we're going to have a baptism we're going to have communion here but i don't know how much longer we're going to do this i'm going to be honest with you we've been sent a message and god's not sending another to come out of her my people and get out of those denominal systems god's opened up the word to us we don't have to probe and figure and it's not that we're living anything that's religious it's just god living inside of us and just changed our lives so when we met him we did different but it's different whitney's not in i've been waiting but whitney's not in just now and whitney got into prayerline the other day at the tent meeting andrew mentioned to some of it whitney has suffered for much of her life with an eating disorder to where she couldn't eat certain things and they put her on a lot of different diets and she'd get sick and she'd get sick and she'd get sick and she would get sick and and we tried everything in the world she can tell you but we tried every we took her all kind of doctors because hey she's my baby girl man i do anything for her davey just happened to walk on water so i had to give her and so so anyway you know it was a miracle that she had the two babies because even the doctor last week said it was impossible for you to have children i can't figure how in the world you had children i can tell you it was in god's hands isaac we saw isaac three years just like your wedding we i saw that two years before i saw isaac walking through the yard with his little finger up and i know this may not be socially cleric today but he had a disney shirt on i saw that too but you know i saw that three years before and then the impossible happens and whitney has a baby and then she has another baby named zoe and so she was going to bring zoe through the prayer line and her own condition for her stomach and she knew that that i wouldn't last long in the prayer line because the prayer line was the longest prayer line we've ever seen incredible miracles that came out of that prayer line because it's in his hands this revival is in his hands this is not a man doing anything this is not me it's not any favorite preacher it's god doing these things and and whitney she actually i asked her to write the testimony down and whitney whitney said that she watched and she knowed that they would pull me at any time and the boys would pull me and they would take me home and it would be that whitney was at the edge of the tent holding zoey as i was going out and my eye caught her and i grabbed zoe and i picked her up and i began to pray for her and as i began to pray for her i begin to speak in tongues those that are very close to us zoe hasn't been saying any words formulated and i begin to pray looser tongue looser tongue she's she's starting to she's starting to talk after a while people be telling her on the way home last night she said i'm mad i'm mad tammy she probably got that from you that's probably your side look at you sideways [Applause] y'all take me out here real quick when i turned around i grabbed whitney and held her and i began to pray for her i never thought anything of her condition not a thing of her condition and i prayed to her and i said baby doll you don't have to go through that prayer line you're well you're well you don't have to go through that prayer line you don't have to stand the weight you're well and she went home and she's ate everything that she wanted to eat without a stomachache national force put israel in her place the holy ghost has put us in our place there's not a bomb can drop until god allows it to drop angels are standing ready to collect us to take us home come on church it feels like every service is a convention here it feels like we're getting closer and closer and closer i want you to realize i had a visitation the other night and he said these three words to me hallelujah you're in my hands you're in my hands i can't lose i want to say this to you i can't lose in his hands maybe you're blind he knows how to spit on the ground and put dirt in your eyes maybe you're a leopard full of sin today he's not ashamed of you he'll wrap his loving arms around you and you'll feel his hands as he wraps his arms around you he's not scared because you're in his hands and i finished when you were flipping you were in his hands because he's got plans and i want to say this to you if you're in his hands god has great big plans for you that was good wasn't it janetta that was good good to be in his hands it good to be in his hands his hands i can trust his hands loves me his hen cares for me his hands protects me see grace how sweet the sound saved a rich like me i was lost [Music] could we worship the lord a moment maybe of a need on your heart and maybe just like to dedicate your day lord come touch us today forgive us of our sins maybe we just need to repent of a little error in our life lord i've been wrong [Music] thank you for letting me live to see this day [Music] lord today is another miracle miracle in my life but many are not fighting cancer but it's a miracle to live maybe may our children appreciate their youth don't let a day go by neglect to serve god through me [Music] i am [Music] um us [Music] the viewing
