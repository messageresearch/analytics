[3:25] if you have your Bibles us evening will
[3:28] turn over in the book of Hebrews chapter
[3:30] 11 Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 and
[3:36] then we'll turn to revelations chapter 3
[3:39] and verse 14
[3:55] ain't God good to give us so many
[3:59] blessings amen
[4:04] tonight I'd like to speak to you on a
[4:06] thought that's been on my heart for
[4:08] about a month or so now on the evidence
[4:13] of a mother lode the evidence of a
[4:17] mother lode the Bible says here in
[4:20] Hebrews 11 and 1 now faith is the
[4:23] substance of things hoped for the
[4:25] evidence of things not seen the evidence
[4:30] of things not seen for by it the elders
[4:35] obtained a good report through faith we
[4:39] understand that the worlds were framed
[4:41] by the Word of God I want you to say
[4:44] that by the Word of God so that the
[4:47] things which are seen were not made of
[4:50] things which do appear as we turn to
[4:54] revelations chapter 3 in verse 14
[4:56] I've asked the brothers to put this
[4:58] quote from the sermon absolute up for us
[5:01] this evening as you're turning there I
[5:04] will read this this quote this evening
[5:06] the Prophet said he is my ultimate he is
[5:11] my stand
[5:12] he is my absolute he is my top post
[5:16] there I stand now if I've got the wrong
[5:20] thing then God will never confirm it but
[5:24] if you have got the right thing God is
[5:27] obligated to confirm it what you say
[5:30] that God is obligated to confirm it
[5:33] there you are and that's the proof of it
[5:37] if it's right
[5:39] God is obligated to prove it's right if
[5:42] it's wrong he will have nothing to do
[5:45] with it revelations 3 and 14 and unto
[5:51] the Angel of the Church of the
[5:52] Laodiceans write these things saith the
[5:55] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[5:58] beginning of the creation of God I know
[6:01] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[6:03] hot how would that work cold
[6:05] hot so them because thou art lukewarm
[6:08] and neither cold nor hot I will spew
[6:11] thee out of my mouth because thou sayest
[6:14] I am rich and increased with Goods and
[6:16] have need of nothing and knowest not
[6:18] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[6:21] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[6:25] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[6:27] thou may us be rich and white raiment
[6:30] that thou may us be clothed and that the
[6:33] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[6:35] anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that
[6:37] thou may a see as many as I love I
[6:41] rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore
[6:43] and repent behold I stand at the door
[6:47] and knock If any man hear my voice and
[6:51] open the door I will come in to him and
[6:53] will sup with him and he with me to him
[6:57] that overcometh will I grant to sit with
[6:59] me and my throne even as I also overcame
[7:02] and I'm set down with my father in his
[7:05] throne he that hath an ear let him hear
[7:08] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[7:11] may God bless his word he may be seated
[7:13] this evening as we are very familiar to
[7:18] this portion of scripture that we've
[7:21] read over in the Book of Revelations
[7:23] knowing that this is the hour that we
[7:24] live in and it it is such a it's such a
[7:29] normal thing to read over the
[7:31] characteristics of the Church of
[7:33] Laodicea and and to see the things that
[7:36] she is to be but before before God gives
[7:40] the characteristics of the Church of
[7:43] Laodicea notice it's the Church of
[7:45] Laodicea but the bride isn't by no means
[7:47] layout of seeing but before he gives the
[7:50] characteristics of the Church of
[7:52] Laodicea that she is that she's wretched
[7:54] and miserable and poor and blind and
[7:56] naked he gives us a final description of
[8:00] himself they're saying that he is the
[8:02] faithful and and that he is
[8:05] the true witness that he is the
[8:07] beginning of the creation of God and He
[8:10] is the a man he has given us a final
[8:12] look at his supreme deity there and we
[8:15] see that before we go through these
[8:18] things that our eyes have got to be upon
[8:21] him if our eyes are upon Laodicea we
[8:24] will get caught up in the chaos of the
[8:25] world and caught up other things in life
[8:28] but we don't want to be caught up with
[8:30] the things of Laodicea we want our eyes
[8:32] on one thing and that is our Lord Jesus
[8:34] Christ for when our eyes are on other
[8:36] things is when we get in trouble now
[8:40] follow me with this quote tonight in the
[8:43] sermon identification he says and today
[8:47] when we hear the message of God come
[8:49] forth we think it's some crook crank or
[8:53] something and and there's plenty of it
[8:55] in the world schemes money-making
[8:57] unconcern people under impressions and
[9:00] speaking as if it was the Lord the Lord
[9:03] always truly identifies himself and
[9:07] notice but in that did you know that all
[9:10] those things have to come certainly the
[9:14] rose must have its thorns the kernel in
[9:16] a nut should be covered over with a bird
[9:20] you have to dig out the bird to get down
[9:23] to the kernel we just fail to see those
[9:26] things the jewels and the metals and
[9:29] jewels and money and silver and gold in
[9:32] these mountains are covered with dirt
[9:34] filled with pyrite and other minerals
[9:36] that run together with it we expect that
[9:40] we expect that you got to dig it out and
[9:43] when the prospector finds what what he
[9:46] calls paid us it's a dust but they see
[9:49] it it symbolizes in there that there's a
[9:52] shadow of a mother lode
[9:54] somewhere and when we see these people
[9:57] today pertaining to begin to be
[10:00] Christians and just living anyway what
[10:03] is it it's a pay dust there's a mother
[10:06] lode somewhere when we need when we see
[10:08] somebody acting like they got the Holy
[10:11] Ghost when they haven't and living a
[10:14] different life it's only a proof
[10:17] that there is a genuine mother lode of
[10:20] the holy ghosts that can be poured out
[10:22] that can give these things that is
[10:25] promised we must be concerned and
[10:28] reverent when we see people going about
[10:31] acting like Christians or trying to be a
[10:34] Christian but yet their life shows that
[10:36] they aren't Christian it is a genuine
[10:38] evidence that there is a true baptism of
[10:41] the Holy Ghost when you see people that
[10:44] want to be Christians where they can't
[10:45] be Christians it's proof that there is
[10:47] real Christian somewhere and I want to
[10:50] say this to you that we live in a day
[10:52] when there are men that that that had
[10:55] they're doing their absolute best to be
[10:58] Christians but because Christ is not on
[11:00] the inside because they are just going
[11:03] by intellectualism are going by a church
[11:06] creed or going by what they know they
[11:09] don't have him it is proving to you that
[11:12] there is more that there is more for you
[11:15] to have we live in an hour of unbelief
[11:20] and and Jesus told us that these things
[11:22] would come to pass and we we could read
[11:25] over in the Bible and Luke 18 and eight
[11:26] that when Jesus said that when the son
[11:29] of man cometh will he find faith again
[11:31] will he found faith he didn't say will I
[11:33] find righteousness but he said will I
[11:35] find faith you see because that's what
[11:38] the enemy is trying to destroy is show
[11:40] faith because if he the source of faith
[11:42] he'll destroy your righteousness he'll
[11:45] destroy your holiness and your purity if
[11:47] he gets to your faith you see Satan is
[11:49] on the attack today to destroy your
[11:52] faith in a living God are you with me
[11:56] tonight today the day that we live in
[11:58] it's a day of deception a day of
[12:00] delusions and and a day of trials a day
[12:03] of turmoil that we live in and we see
[12:05] the Spirit of Hell it's on a rampage
[12:08] like never before seeking to destroy
[12:10] every bit of belief that there is left
[12:13] you see is doing this absolute best to
[12:16] kill out believers but I believe that
[12:18] this is a house of God that is filled
[12:20] with believers not unbelievers not make
[12:23] believers I'm going to put you in the
[12:25] category that
[12:27] profit would put you in in the believers
[12:30] of this hour I know that the Prophet
[12:33] said that every church there there's
[12:35] three kind of believers but I'm gonna
[12:37] believe with everything that's within me
[12:38] tonight that you are true believers and
[12:41] if you are not I'm asking tonight that
[12:44] body into this service that you not be
[12:46] caught up in the category of the make
[12:48] believer in the unbeliever but you'd be
[12:51] in the category from on high because if
[12:54] you are not in that category one of
[12:56] these days you'll be looking for me to
[12:59] preach and I won't be here but I'm
[13:01] trusting that you'll be with me where
[13:04] I'm going but the enemy is all as
[13:12] absolute he's doing his absolute best he
[13:14] loves what he does and you see he's
[13:17] doing his best to attack you and it and
[13:19] you find in a day the day that we live
[13:22] in that it takes a minister a good 15
[13:24] minutes to get into the service just to
[13:27] get his people I offer the mind of the
[13:30] things of the world didn't trying to get
[13:32] that mind off of things that they've
[13:34] been through in the week it takes a good
[13:35] 15 minutes for the minister because you
[13:38] see why it is Satan that is doing his
[13:41] best to block the visitation of the
[13:43] angel that's his job is to fight against
[13:46] you
[13:47] we know he hates us but we hate him too
[13:49] and if he's going to fight us
[13:52] let's fight him
[13:53] [Applause]
[14:00] it's a time when men are constantly
[14:03] having to be reminded that they're men
[14:06] and that women are constantly having to
[14:08] be reminded that they're women and I'm
[14:10] talking in natural and I'm talking in
[14:12] the spiritual realm men have forgotten
[14:15] what type of clothes apply they're
[14:16] supposed to put on and women have
[14:18] forgotten what type of clothes that
[14:20] they're supposed to put on are you with
[14:23] me tonight but you see also in the
[14:25] spiritual realm you will find that that
[14:28] is preached to you on your position and
[14:30] your authority more than ever before
[14:33] because Satan his shrine is best to
[14:35] block you from your position you see if
[14:38] you don't know who you are you don't
[14:40] know your authority but if you know who
[14:43] you are if you know what family you came
[14:46] from
[14:47] you carry a heritage of the whole entire
[14:50] family if you can look tonight in your
[14:52] spiritual heritage you would see King
[14:55] David there that slew Goliath you would
[14:57] sing King Isaiah there you would see the
[15:00] prophets of Allah there you would see
[15:02] all throughout they are men of rebbe
[15:05] they men of such a stature that cannot
[15:10] be pushed away in your heritage tonight
[15:13] there is all types of warriors there's
[15:17] the great general Josh who are there
[15:19] there's Moses there if you know who you
[15:23] are you know who you are not hello I'm
[15:32] not a shifflett I'm a Spencer I Know Who
[15:35] I am so I know who I'm not I'm a son of
[15:39] God so I know I'm not I know I'm not a
[15:42] child of the devil come on deal with me
[15:48] tonight I'm a son of God so I know that
[15:51] I cannot be pertaining to the devil why
[15:53] because I have been birthed by Papa you
[16:01] see but that's where Satan wants to keep
[16:03] the people at he wants to keep you and
[16:06] battle you with with such an amnesia to
[16:08] keep you off of your ground
[16:10] it's such a spirit of amnesia in the
[16:12] world today that believe that the enemy
[16:14] is trying to rob the people from the
[16:16] blessings of God you see Satan enjoys
[16:19] attacking you he loves doing his job he
[16:23] loves attacking your health
[16:24] he loves tearing down your belief system
[16:27] he's been working against you for a
[16:29] mighty long time you may have been here
[16:31] maybe twenty thirty years man you been
[16:34] flattened against Satan ever since you
[16:35] got here but Satan has been battling
[16:38] against you before you ever got here
[16:40] he's been battling your family he's been
[16:44] battling your heritage he's been
[16:45] battling your lineage
[16:47] breaking down and battling your belief
[16:49] system of your family figuring out your
[16:53] weaknesses what you are and what you are
[16:55] not trying to figure out what you're
[16:57] tempted by you see if Satan can't get
[16:59] you with alcohol here throw cigarettes
[17:01] on you and if we can't get you with
[17:03] cigarettes he'll throw drugs on you and
[17:04] if we can't get drugs on you he will try
[17:07] to tear down your health and if they
[17:09] can't get to your health he'll try to
[17:10] tear down your mind your reasoning your
[17:12] affection and on your imagination and
[17:15] your conscience and all of these things
[17:16] and if he can't get there he'll move on
[17:19] to the soul round
[17:20] that's his ultimate goal is to get you
[17:22] to dapped because there's two realms
[17:24] there whether you choose to believe or
[17:27] doubt God and Satan is doing his best to
[17:31] get to that soul realm to get you to
[17:33] doubt and be an unbeliever and if he
[17:36] can't get to your soul realm he'll go to
[17:38] your family because if Satan can't get
[17:40] you as a husband he'll go to your wife
[17:42] he'll go to your children and if he
[17:44] can't get your children he'd go to your
[17:46] friends and if he can't get you to fall
[17:48] by looking at your friends he'll go to
[17:50] your church family and if he can't get
[17:52] you to fall by looking at your church
[17:54] family he'll start tearing away every
[17:57] bit of faith that he can and try to rob
[18:00] you from the Word of God he'll steal
[18:02] your time from reading he'll steal your
[18:04] time from praying he'll steal your time
[18:07] from the message
[18:15] he's been on your turf for a mighty long
[18:18] time and it's time to kick him off he's
[18:21] been on your territory for a mighty long
[18:23] time and it's time to kick him off he's
[18:27] not satisfied with just tearing down
[18:29] your health he wants everything that
[18:31] y'all pay what's your time he wants you
[18:34] money he wants your energies and he will
[18:39] use any means possible to get to you he
[18:42] will use the ones that are closest to
[18:44] you to tear you down he will use the
[18:46] ones closest to you in your ranks to get
[18:49] you to disbelieve this are you with me
[18:51] tonight
[18:52] people that you never thought that would
[18:54] turn away he will use those he will use
[18:57] those to try to get you to doubt you see
[18:59] Satan is grabbing at every opportunity
[19:02] that he can to take the believers out of
[19:05] the category of believers and put them
[19:07] and make believers or unbelievers but I
[19:10] say Satan back up in the name of Jesus
[19:13] [Applause]
[19:19] he go try to put cancer on you he go try
[19:23] to put all kinds of diseases on you he's
[19:25] going to try to rob him but I want you
[19:28] to do this that when you see these
[19:30] things coming I want you to say thank
[19:32] you because it's just proving who you
[19:35] are you see it's an evidence of who you
[19:39] are when Satan is attacking you on what
[19:42] you are and what you believe in
[19:44] it proves who you are you see if safety
[19:48] net got you he's warring against you he
[19:51] proves to me that he ain't got me
[19:53] because he's tried to beat me every
[19:55] which way from Sunday but praise God I'm
[19:58] in the house of God tonight praise God
[20:01] he tried to keep you from church tonight
[20:03] but praise God you're here let him do
[20:11] his worst thank you it's an evidence of
[20:18] Who I am
[20:22] hallelujah no doubt no doubt when when
[20:32] the mother Mary when his salutations
[20:35] were brought to her by the angel no
[20:38] doubt she had her critics no doubt she
[20:41] had her scholars no doubt maybe in her
[20:44] own family structure there were people
[20:46] that questioned her what she what she
[20:48] believed and I know Mary maybe you and
[20:51] Joseph had maybe without had some
[20:53] Mexican that night and had some spices
[20:56] it just messed up your dreams and maybe
[20:58] you threw some cinnamon all on you
[21:00] coffee or something and made you dream
[21:01] all kinds of different things and and
[21:03] you know maybe maybe this made maybe you
[21:06] don't really know what you're talking
[21:07] about is man you know maybe it wasn't an
[21:10] angel maybe it was just a dream Mary are
[21:14] you really sure that it's you are you
[21:17] sure that he said that you would bring
[21:20] forth the Sun and that you would call
[21:22] his name Jesus but the proof was in the
[21:26] pudding
[21:27] the proof was in the pudding that when
[21:30] she walked up to to see her cousin
[21:33] Elizabeth and when she'd went up layer
[21:36] everything that the angel had told her
[21:38] she began to give her salutation to her
[21:42] cousin Elizabeth and if there was no
[21:45] power behind Mary's testimony what was
[21:48] about to take place would have never
[21:50] been confirmed by Almighty God
[21:52] you see if God is in it he'll be
[21:54] confirmed and when Mary begin to give
[21:59] her testimony of what the angel told her
[22:02] her cousin Elizabeth said Mary when you
[22:06] spoke the name Jesus there had been a
[22:09] dead baby in my womb you see if there
[22:12] was no power behind the name of Jesus
[22:14] John would have stayed there dead but
[22:17] there was so much proof in what Mary had
[22:20] said that the evidence was in the mother
[22:23] lode that there was power in the name of
[22:27] Jesus it brought life to it did womb
[22:30] life to a dead baby hello oh well maybe
[22:38] no doubt Mary had her skeptics around
[22:41] her I said I don't know about all this I
[22:43] could hear Mary say you just wait nine
[22:45] months and you'll see you just wait and
[22:49] see this won't be some ordinary boy but
[22:52] this war he will be able to take his
[22:54] toys he will be able to take his toys
[22:57] and make the giraffe the toy giraffe
[22:59] make it walk make the toy elephant and
[23:02] make it walk this boys of a different
[23:06] kind and if you don't believe that I
[23:08] could hear Mary say just wait 33 years
[23:11] and watch him die he will cry like a
[23:15] human he will be in pain like a man he
[23:20] will be beat like a man he'll scream
[23:22] like a man he'll die like a man
[23:24] but he'll raise like God
[23:31] hello here we find today that there's
[23:40] such a falling away it seems to be that
[23:42] people are not interested like they used
[23:44] to be they're following the fundamental
[23:47] facts of the Bible there seem to be
[23:50] drifting and I think it's I think all
[23:52] ministers who love the Word of God and
[23:55] know that that's the only standard in
[23:58] which we can be assure that were right
[24:00] it's the only standard and we can be
[24:03] assured that we're right the reason I
[24:05] stand here before you tonight is not
[24:07] because I believe I'm right but because
[24:09] the Bible says I should be here
[24:11] I wouldn't preach to you about a bride
[24:14] that can overcome unless the Bible said
[24:16] it I couldn't I wouldn't preach I
[24:18] couldn't preach to you that God is the
[24:20] same yesterday today and forever unless
[24:22] the Bible said it the reason why we
[24:27] believe this message is because it's
[24:29] backed up by the Lord of all mighty
[24:31] caught let the devil do what he wants to
[24:35] but this message is thus saith the Lord
[24:39] [Applause]
[24:45] a mother lode maybe you're not familiar
[24:51] with the term but the mother a mother
[24:53] lode is a principle vein of an ore or a
[24:57] mineral a vein may be of gold of silver
[25:04] of copper and different very valuable
[25:09] materials of the land it is a when when
[25:14] someone says that they have hit the
[25:16] mother lode they're basically saying I
[25:19] just got rich overnight they are saying
[25:24] that they have found a channel that will
[25:26] produce unlimited wealth when they're
[25:30] saying that I have hit the mother lode
[25:31] you know you know that they're on top of
[25:35] something great and in the United States
[25:39] there is actually a portion of the
[25:41] states that is called the mother lode of
[25:44] California a mother lode is most
[25:47] famously name given to a long alignment
[25:49] of hardrock gold deposits stretching
[25:52] from Northwest to southeast in the
[25:55] Sierra Nevada of California and this
[25:59] mother lode it was discovered in the
[26:01] early 1850s during the gold rush and the
[26:05] California the California mother lode is
[26:09] a zone from about one point five to six
[26:13] kilometers which is almost point nine
[26:15] three to three point seven three miles
[26:18] wide to a hundred and twenty miles long
[26:23] is this mother lode but they had found
[26:27] it in the 1850s and by the year of 1851
[26:32] there was over two and a half million
[26:35] ounces of gold that had been been
[26:38] extracted from the mother lode and
[26:41] within nine years nearly 24 million
[26:44] ounces of gold had been extracted but
[26:48] you know before the rush and before the
[26:50] fan of this there was somebody that had
[26:53] to find evidence that there was
[26:54] something there
[26:56] he'd been laying there maybe maybe for
[26:59] thousands of years laying there in that
[27:01] spot but somebody had to come across it
[27:04] and to prove that there was a mother
[27:09] lode there that there was a vein or a
[27:12] channel that would release unlimited
[27:15] wealth UCA was a paid a showing that
[27:20] they were just scratching the surface
[27:22] maybe they just panned a little bit of
[27:25] gold and they said and you know what
[27:27] maybe there's a little bit more here
[27:29] maybe we'll dig down a little bit
[27:31] further you know that's what I happened
[27:34] what happened to me when I come to him
[27:37] is I had just been scratching the
[27:40] surface as it were I maybe had glimpses
[27:44] of him maybe I had experiences of him
[27:47] but it was only showing me that there
[27:49] was more to come I could remember
[27:53] walking down to the altar and feel the
[27:55] anointing on my flesh and watching it
[27:58] watching it move on my life but yet it
[28:01] did not live in my soul I couldn't watch
[28:04] it as he would anoint me to sing or
[28:06] maybe I know him made a test of hi
[28:08] or maybe just to be able to speak he
[28:10] would anoint maybe he wouldn't he would
[28:12] drive me down to the altar of the
[28:14] anointing what was it showing me he was
[28:16] an evidence that there was more to come
[28:18] I can still remember the night that Dan
[28:22] Daisley preached his last sermon here
[28:23] and brother Mike walls was in the
[28:25] meeting I can remember when they come
[28:27] and laid their hands on my only altar
[28:29] and the anointing touched my life I
[28:31] still remember that it was in evidence
[28:34] he was in evidence of a mother loaf I
[28:38] was scratching the surface but when I
[28:41] got there on the streets of Canada I got
[28:45] a hold of the mother lode and he they
[28:49] never run dry I've been digging at it
[28:52] ever since and more keeps coming out
[28:58] he never left me because he's the same
[29:02] yesterday today and forever and the God
[29:05] that made me overcome last week he's the
[29:07] God that may be overcome this week and
[29:10] he'll make me overcome next week what is
[29:14] it I found the one that I've been
[29:17] looking for whoa
[29:23] maybe that's you tonight maybe you've
[29:25] just been scratching the surface all
[29:27] your life
[29:27] but I want to tell you it's an evidence
[29:31] and there's more for you you ain't got
[29:35] to be one of the followers that was just
[29:36] following him for the meal
[29:38] follow him for the 5,000 feed the 5,000
[29:41] or following him so that he could just
[29:43] touch your body
[29:45] you ain't gotta follow him just for the
[29:47] benefit package you can follow him and
[29:50] he live on the inside of you you got to
[29:58] dig at it there was somebody that found
[30:01] that mother low but they had to dig it
[30:03] out there's all types of channels in
[30:06] that mother lode in California that it
[30:09] reaches all the way down and maybe
[30:11] thousands of meters out that it reaches
[30:13] all the way up but somebody knew that it
[30:16] was there somebody had to dig it out
[30:19] maybe I'll say it to you like this has
[30:21] believers that you understand there was
[30:23] somebody that came with a message of
[30:26] justification it was just evidence that
[30:30] there was more to come and when Wesley
[30:33] came with sanctification it was evidence
[30:35] that there was more to come
[30:37] and when Pentecost came with the
[30:39] restoration of the gifts it was an
[30:41] evidence that there was a mother low
[30:43] coming that Christ himself would
[30:46] disperse himself in this stay I've been
[30:50] told I'm wrong for preaching that Christ
[30:52] is here but I declare to you by the word
[30:55] of the Lord that Jesus Christ is here
[30:59] [Applause]
[31:02] if you want sir evidence look around
[31:08] healings miracles transformations
[31:12] diseases and tumors fallen off the
[31:14] evidence is right before you
[31:17] I ain't got to see the pillar fire to
[31:21] know he's here
[31:21] his word said he'd be here and I just
[31:24] happened to take him at his word if you
[31:31] want to dig it out you want to see your
[31:34] family get it you got to start digging
[31:37] make your valley full of ditches hit a
[31:41] tin can dig it out hit an old rotten
[31:45] board dig it out if the TV's in your way
[31:49] dig it out if the phone's in your way
[31:51] dig it out fellow go Satan don't let
[31:59] Satan rob you you remember a sermon
[32:04] brother on preach take your back
[32:08] don't wait for it take it back we got
[32:15] too many delinquent parents that are
[32:17] letting their children do anything they
[32:18] want to it's time that mothers and
[32:20] fathers start taking it back start
[32:24] digging and ask your child don't want to
[32:26] dig it out dig it out children if your
[32:33] mama refuses to dig it out you get down
[32:36] there with a double-barrel shotgun hold
[32:38] this shotgun in your hand and get a
[32:40] shovel and start digging out for your
[32:42] whole family what I'm saying
[32:46] what I'm saying is proving that we are
[32:50] right on top of the mother lode
[32:52] [Applause]
[32:58] but a lot of people don't want to put
[33:00] their fur into it
[33:01] they don't want to do it they don't
[33:03] wanna they don't put the time and study
[33:05] into it well if God don't give me the
[33:07] Holy Ghost in 15 minutes I guess he
[33:08] don't want to give it to me you're
[33:10] absolutely wrong lot of people just want
[33:13] to ride in and on the profits coattail
[33:15] right in on the pastures experience but
[33:19] then I add the pastures got it that
[33:21] means I'll get it someday
[33:23] this should be your hour stop waiting
[33:26] for it it's here I mean people don't
[33:34] want to die for it too many people don't
[33:36] want to lay on the altar for it but I
[33:39] want to tell you if you see somebody
[33:40] they don't want to go all the way don't
[33:42] you dare give up you see somebody that
[33:45] tells you that this message they write
[33:47] don't you dare give up on your belief
[33:49] there's gonna be scholars and critics
[33:51] rise up on the scene don't you dare back
[33:54] off of your belief just because somebody
[33:56] else falls or somebody else disbelieves
[33:59] you keep marching onward Christian
[34:01] soldiers you get back in line we're
[34:04] right around the corner we got the last
[34:09] smile and we're running all the way
[34:11] don't back up
[34:13] don't turn around after Jesus died on
[34:21] the cross and was placed in a borrowed
[34:23] tomb no doubt the critics of scoffers
[34:26] the Pharisees and the Sadducees was
[34:29] having themselves a big old time maybe
[34:32] no doubt dancing in the street and
[34:34] partying in the street said that one
[34:35] that said that he was raised on the
[34:37] third day he's dead and gone now what
[34:40] was it it was an evidence that there was
[34:42] more coming they were enjoying
[34:44] themselves on Friday and maybe old
[34:46] Saturday but I got bad news for them
[34:48] sunday was coming they tried to put him
[34:53] in a bar Oh - they tried to seal it and
[34:55] put soldiers around it but you can't
[34:57] keep Jesus in a dead tomb
[35:04] well I'm oh preach to you tonight he's
[35:10] carnal believers they were proving that
[35:13] there was a motherhood laying right
[35:14] there in the ground
[35:16] ooh that something was about to break
[35:20] loose the Prophet said that when you
[35:23] find a bogus dollar where's that speak
[35:26] to you will you take all your money out
[35:30] of the bank and throw it in the river
[35:31] because you found a bogus dollar that be
[35:35] stupid that bogus dollar only means that
[35:41] there's a real dollar it's made off of
[35:43] and Pentecost is full of carnal
[35:47] impersonations but what does it mean you
[35:51] see somebody that can't live it what's
[35:54] it mean you see somebody that won't
[35:57] don't want it what's it mean it means
[36:00] that there's a real one there's some way
[36:02] if somebody trying to impersonate
[36:05] something that somebody else really has
[36:08] it's only a meal tickets only something
[36:11] that's genuine behind the thing that
[36:16] somebody is trying to impersonate
[36:19] prophet would say the Pentecost was just
[36:22] a scaffold worth it was just a scaffold
[36:25] work that was to be tore down after the
[36:28] house was built it was just a pay dust
[36:33] showing that there was a mother lode
[36:35] laying there we've seen all types of
[36:39] counterfeits and all types of fakes
[36:42] that's one thing I hate is a fake I
[36:47] can't stand it when somebody tries to
[36:50] sell me a ripoff or not call for a fake
[36:52] sure I've had it tried done to me and
[36:55] all types of different business deals
[36:57] men try to sell me something that they
[36:59] says worth $500 but it ain't worth 5
[37:02] bucks
[37:04] you see you got to know what you're
[37:06] looking at if you don't know what you're
[37:08] looking at you'll get sold on a dummy
[37:11] but I want you to know what we're
[37:13] preaching to unite he's not a dummy it's
[37:16] not some mannequin that's just stiff and
[37:18] laying there in the corner but this is a
[37:20] living god that's that's breathing and
[37:23] acting and brooding yeah there's all
[37:29] types of mannequins that people's
[37:31] dressed up in suits it says that the
[37:33] days of miracles is past all there is is
[37:35] a bunch of mannequins and to me they
[37:40] ain't got the breath inline inside of
[37:43] them to let it loose but praise God
[37:46] they're Samir that stand behind suits
[37:49] that stand behind some blue jeans that
[37:52] don't matter if they dressed up on
[37:54] Saturday dressed up on Sunday they
[37:56] believe that there's a Living God that
[38:01] this message is him rugged man of God
[38:08] rugged women of God that the devil try
[38:11] to rob this from them that stand up as a
[38:13] backup Satan I know in whom I have
[38:16] believed and I'm not ashamed of it
[38:22] well glory he remember when the Prophet
[38:28] was dealing with a man he would call was
[38:33] a bosom friend to him dr. Reid head this
[38:37] dr. Reid head was a was a well-educated
[38:40] man that had what that it could blast
[38:42] through the walls of degrees and he was
[38:46] dr. Reid head was dealing with a young
[38:47] Muhammad and man one time he was telling
[38:50] for you go back why don't you get some
[38:52] of that good heartfelt religion you know
[38:53] once you come over and serve Jesus and
[38:56] he said he said no disrespect basically
[38:58] is what I'm just paraphrasing here
[39:00] there's no disrespect said between your
[39:03] religions or whatnot he said but we can
[39:05] produce as much psychology as you
[39:07] Christians can we can produce the same
[39:10] thing you say you got joy oh we got joy
[39:12] you say you got happiness we got
[39:14] happiness
[39:15] we said what I our jesus is alive though
[39:17] he said we'll prove it then he said will
[39:20] you believe it because he lives in our
[39:22] heart is who approve that to me how's
[39:23] that possible and they began to tell him
[39:26] said talk to him about mark 16 and tell
[39:28] him 7 now jesus said that these signs
[39:31] will follow them that belief and dr.
[39:33] Reed had said he said now say young sir
[39:36] said we being theologians we understand
[39:38] that mark 16 is uninspired he said what
[39:41] kind of book are you reading then if
[39:44] it's uninspired then why are you reading
[39:47] it if one portion of the Bible was wrong
[39:50] then why you're reading it here this
[39:53] man was putting a so-called
[39:56] believer in this place he began to tell
[40:00] him what Jesus said over in John 14 that
[40:03] the worst that I do so you do also he
[40:06] said then and begin to tell him said you
[40:08] know the works that I do would be
[40:09] believing on him things of that manner
[40:11] he said when you can prove to me that
[40:14] jesus is alive come back and tell me and
[40:17] dr. Reed hid went to brother Branham he
[40:19] hung his head and he was walked away
[40:21] defeated he walked away defeated didn't
[40:24] know how to answer the man and brother
[40:26] ban himself he began to lead him to the
[40:30] Holy Ghost give him give him instruction
[40:32] how to receive the Holy Ghost he said he
[40:35] got down there on the floor and they got
[40:37] to praying for the baptism of the Holy
[40:39] Ghost and the Holy Ghost came on him and
[40:41] he had a coffee table there and the
[40:44] glass broke out of it when the Holy
[40:45] Ghost came on him but just because dr.
[40:51] Reed head couldn't back up what the
[40:53] Bible says does not mean that the Bible
[40:56] wasn't right I'm using scriptures
[41:03] tonight that so-called people that
[41:05] walked away from the message have
[41:07] preached before but just because they
[41:09] say it ain't right doesn't mean it ain't
[41:11] right I purposely have done this tonight
[41:16] to show the devil to a debate and a
[41:19] challenge that there's a people that do
[41:21] believe it is right and come back up
[41:23] what the Bible says he's the same Holy
[41:33] Ghost same power same life working in us
[41:37] doing the same actions what them people
[41:44] are is just evidence of you and me we're
[41:51] a true reflection our character has been
[41:56] molded by him when Christ was the
[42:00] expression of God himself and now we are
[42:04] here expressing deity we are here you
[42:08] see when they would find those when
[42:10] those men would find that gold they
[42:13] would be dross in it that they had to
[42:15] beat out so that it would so that it
[42:16] would be fer perfect they would turn
[42:19] that gold over and beat it and beat it
[42:21] and beat it just to get a true
[42:22] reflection and when they could look in
[42:24] that gold and see themselves they knew
[42:27] that it was ready
[42:29] God has beat us back and forth so that
[42:32] we would throw out a true reflection of
[42:35] him and if we're not so in him we need
[42:40] to go back and get a little bit more
[42:41] dross beat out of us but I don't like
[42:46] that but any child but any child that
[42:49] does not stand correction was it so is
[42:53] the best but Oh blessed is he that
[43:02] endures you see character is molded by
[43:08] him power without character satanic
[43:16] but power with character is fit to rule
[43:20] there's a reason why God chose you
[43:23] before the foundation or you're a
[43:25] reflection of him you were showing him
[43:29] before the foundation of the world that
[43:32] you were fit to rule before there was an
[43:36] atom or a molecule spoke into place
[43:42] we've seen enough counterfeits in this
[43:45] day we've seen enough men trying to
[43:48] reproduce or produce a born-again
[43:50] experience by intellectualism and it's
[43:52] always fun it's always come to its
[43:55] demise we don't want to be a Judas
[43:59] terian we follow him because of truth
[44:03] not for the script back the Bible says
[44:08] in March 16 and 17 and these signs shall
[44:10] follow them that believe them that
[44:14] believe them that believe in my name
[44:18] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[44:21] speak with new tongues they so take up
[44:22] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[44:24] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[44:26] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[44:29] recover this is a promise to believers
[44:33] not to unbelievers this is a promise
[44:37] that is given to you that that by his
[44:40] name these things would be done and now
[44:43] the name of Jesus is not some magic word
[44:46] will we go around speak in the name of
[44:49] Jesus and and things just take place and
[44:51] we happen to use it haphazardly when we
[44:54] pray at nighttime we just speak and hope
[44:56] things are going to happen but as sons
[44:59] and daughters of God we realize that our
[45:01] identification is in that name we
[45:04] recognize that salvation is in that name
[45:06] that healing is in that name we
[45:09] recognize that deliverance is in that
[45:10] name we recognize that at that name that
[45:14] ever needs shall bow and every tongue
[45:17] shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[45:20] we know that at that name that demons
[45:23] will flee sickness will flee the devil
[45:26] has to move
[45:27] the name of Jesus Christ but it's not
[45:31] because just somebody on the street says
[45:33] well what Jesus do this or Jesus do that
[45:36] when you go around just speak in the
[45:38] name of Jesus God don't have to honor
[45:40] that when you do it in vain but God has
[45:44] to honor that when there is a life
[45:45] behind it and when you embody the Holy
[45:49] Spirit Himself Zoe himself God has to
[45:53] back up what you say why because you are
[45:57] ambassadors of heaven that when you
[46:00] speak all of heaven is behind you and
[46:02] all hell may be against you but all of
[46:05] heaven is for you young people if you
[46:10] can ever realize that if you truly get
[46:13] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[46:15] Ghost I'm not just talking about it on
[46:18] your flesh where you enjoy coming to
[46:20] church or enjoy coming to the youth
[46:22] events I'm talking about truly baptized
[46:25] truly died out and when the Holy Ghost
[46:28] lives on the inside of you I want you to
[46:31] know that there's a power that's backing
[46:32] you up you ain't got to worry about
[46:35] walking down the aisles you ain't gotta
[46:37] worry about people making fun of you
[46:39] there will be a life behind you that
[46:42] will back up what you say it'll back up
[46:46] their life you live but don't you dare
[46:55] back off your own life or back off your
[46:57] belief just because somebody else
[46:59] unbelievers just because they can't
[47:04] produce these works don't you dare back
[47:05] off of it we've had all types of carnal
[47:11] impersonations in this day a matter of
[47:13] fact brother Branham said that this is a
[47:15] day of carnal impersonations that this
[47:18] is a day of matching he said you paint
[47:20] your steps red and watch your neighbor
[47:21] would do it he'll just hey just has to
[47:24] paint his red you swap your Chevrolet
[47:26] for a Ford and for business we'll get
[47:28] good that's right just the way everybody
[47:31] wants to match the other one and that's
[47:33] where we find the day that we get too
[47:35] much impersonations
[47:37] and when you do that you're always in
[47:38] trouble you cannot live the other fellas
[47:41] life we cannot impersonate something we
[47:44] must be just what we are
[47:47] I love brother Tim Pruett I love brother
[47:51] Timothy and I love brother Ron Spencer
[47:53] and brother Donnie Reagan but I can't be
[47:55] them so what's the good of me trying to
[47:57] impersonate them or them trying to
[48:00] impersonate me what good is he going to
[48:03] do for me to try to impersonate brother
[48:06] Branham if I'm not brother branham hello
[48:10] come on somebody come on somebody but
[48:14] what would it do if you were totally
[48:17] embody the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[48:21] would no longer be you trying to put it
[48:23] on but him living it out through you
[48:26] [Music]
[48:28] we got people telling us that we can't
[48:31] sing only believe because that was only
[48:33] the Prophet song we got people telling
[48:36] us that we shouldn't lay hands on the
[48:37] sick because only the Prophet could do
[48:39] that tell me where in the scripture it
[48:42] ever said so
[48:43] [Applause]
[48:50] I want my experience to match God's
[48:55] Bible so that's the kind of Matson that
[48:59] we ought to do match up with the
[49:01] standard of God you look over in Acts
[49:06] chapter 19
[49:08] when Paul goes down to the city of
[49:10] Ephesus there and Paul finds finds
[49:14] believers that were following John's
[49:16] teachings and Paul begins to talk to
[49:20] them have you received the Holy Ghost
[49:22] since you believed and they said we know
[49:24] not whether they hear we have not heard
[49:25] whether there be any Holy Ghost yet and
[49:27] then Paul recognized that there was
[49:31] something different in their experience
[49:34] you see he began to ask them then how
[49:37] was you baptized you see he realized
[49:40] that there was an evidence of something
[49:42] more that was to come and he began to
[49:45] take them to the teachings of baptism
[49:47] they said that if you repent and be
[49:50] baptized every one of you in the name of
[49:51] the Lord Jesus Christ that you shall
[49:53] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[49:56] Paul and they went and were baptized in
[49:59] the name of the Lord Jesus and Paul laid
[50:03] his hands on them and they received the
[50:05] Holy Ghost and Paul went up to the
[50:08] synagogue and he began to preach and
[50:10] preach boldly there for a space of three
[50:13] months and you see it as always the word
[50:16] that does the separating he began to
[50:19] persuade men to come to the kingdom of
[50:21] God and then brought about disputing
[50:23] XANA and controversies because the word
[50:26] was doing the separating in that day but
[50:30] the Bible says in acts 19 11 follow
[50:33] along with men god rocks but some
[50:35] miracle special miracles by the hands of
[50:37] Paul so that from his body were brought
[50:40] under the sick handkerchiefs or aprons
[50:41] and diseases departed from them I've got
[50:46] a little bit of rebound here and the
[50:47] evil spirits went out of them then
[50:49] certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists
[50:52] took upon them to call over them which
[50:54] had evil spirits the name of the Lord
[50:57] Jesus saying we adjure you notices
[51:01] here these vagabonds exorcists begin to
[51:04] take upon themselves to go lay hands on
[51:07] those that had evil spirits saying we
[51:10] adjourn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches
[51:12] and there were seven sons of one Steve I
[51:15] Jew and a chief of the priests which did
[51:18] so and the evil spirit answered and said
[51:22] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[51:26] you and the man in whom the evil spirit
[51:30] was leaped on them and overcame them and
[51:33] prevailed against them so that they fled
[51:35] out of the house naked and wounded and
[51:37] this was known to all the Jews and the
[51:40] Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and fear
[51:43] fell on them and the name of the Lord
[51:46] Jesus was magnified and many that
[51:50] believed came and confessed showing
[51:52] their deeds many of them also which used
[51:55] curious arts brought their books
[51:56] together and burned them before old men
[52:01] you see what took place they had a good
[52:04] old-fashioned burner and they counted
[52:06] the price of them and found it fifty
[52:09] thousand pieces of silver so mightily
[52:11] grew the Word of God and prevailed the
[52:19] hour is here when right and wrong is
[52:24] being made manifest
[52:26] you see Ephesus was a sinner of for for
[52:29] black magic it was a place where
[52:32] witchcraft for it was practiced where
[52:34] they would give out magical formulas to
[52:36] give wealth and happiness and success
[52:38] sounds like a lot of lay on us here
[52:40] today where psychologists try to preach
[52:42] you happier try to teach you happy by by
[52:45] doing this or by creating some kind of
[52:47] yoga mat that you can lay down and
[52:49] breathe seven times and you'll get happy
[52:52] let me tell you I don't believe that'll
[52:55] make you happy but here in the city of
[52:58] Ephesus these seven sons of sceva when
[53:01] Nepal when they seen Paul's anointing
[53:03] and the power behind the teachings of
[53:06] Paul they were impressed and astonished
[53:09] were the power the name of Jesus which
[53:11] worked through Paul
[53:14] what was it there was something real
[53:16] about Paul you want some fake you see
[53:20] the thing about the gospel he just lives
[53:24] it ain't got to be propped up no matter
[53:27] who stands for it or no matter who
[53:30] denies it no matter how many come no
[53:33] matter how many go the gospel still
[53:35] stands and still has power behind it and
[53:38] you see here were unconverted people
[53:42] that were attaching themselves to the
[53:45] gospel desiring that power desiring a
[53:49] work of the Holy Ghost but they never
[53:51] allowed Christ to reign predominant in
[53:54] their life and they never come to grips
[53:56] with the message the man said we didn't
[54:00] come to talk about it we come to get in
[54:03] it I'm afraid of too many people come
[54:08] and just set on the pews I'm afraid that
[54:11] we got too many young people are too
[54:13] many middle-aged people that are that
[54:15] are holding onto somebody's coattail
[54:18] yeah they see it's true yeah they see it
[54:21] living in the past so she as they see it
[54:23] and living in the elders but what about
[54:25] them there's too many people that's just
[54:28] holding on just to well it happened 30
[54:31] years ago what about right now well days
[54:36] gone by we've seen a power of God what
[54:38] about in your life don't you worry about
[54:42] days gone by don't worry about that
[54:44] don't worry about your neighbor you
[54:45] worry about you well bless God I tried
[54:57] what you need to do is stop trying
[55:03] you just tried is proven to you that
[55:06] it's evidence there's more to go if you
[55:13] just let go just let go just let go take
[55:19] a deep breath let go you won't live
[55:22] through it you gonna live through it I'm
[55:25] living proof you can live through it you
[55:28] can overcome but we got too many people
[55:33] caught up on virtual realities you got
[55:39] too many people today that actually go
[55:41] back in the photo books go back in the
[55:45] family photos book and they're so used
[55:48] to the world that they live in that they
[55:50] actually scroll in on those old
[55:51] photographs with their fingers in paper
[55:54] photographs and they realize wait a
[55:56] minute that's not my phone that's an old
[55:59] photograph that's the kind of world that
[56:02] we live in I thought I had my phone in
[56:06] the hand they don't know nothing about
[56:09] them polaroid pictures they're in a
[56:13] sacred thing and make sure come out
[56:15] right take that picture man that thing
[56:20] was awesome you had to know that you
[56:23] were smiling perfect before they took
[56:25] that thing because if you didn't it was
[56:30] a lasting memory that's stuck with you
[56:34] man my hair wasn't right
[56:36] let me take 42 more pictures so I get it
[56:40] right but too many people are caught up
[56:43] in the world of virtual realities and
[56:45] they have no clue about real life
[56:47] anymore
[56:47] they don't know about overcoming anymore
[56:50] because they're caught up on an Internet
[56:53] they're caught up with ideas on the
[56:56] internet and all they realize is a
[56:58] virtual reality that there's their life
[57:01] that gaming's their life that's speaking
[57:04] to somebody on internet is their life
[57:06] what about the person you're sitting
[57:08] across from
[57:10] let me get back over here for you murder
[57:13] me tonight but it's time that we come to
[57:20] grips with what we're preaching here
[57:22] this ain't some dead letter but this is
[57:25] a spirit of truth that is being preached
[57:28] to you you come to grips with this
[57:30] message and it will produce the same
[57:33] life these men would call him in the
[57:40] name of Jesus without even knowing him
[57:42] personally and when to cast out an evil
[57:45] spirit and that spirit cried out Jesus I
[57:47] know and Paul I know but who are you
[57:50] I wonder tonight if that would be you if
[57:54] you begin to come up here and somebody
[57:56] had an evil spirit on them and you laid
[57:58] your hand on it and that evil spirit
[58:00] cried out who are you you can answer the
[58:06] question but you see these were Cardinal
[58:09] impersonators who did not know the
[58:11] purpose of God what were they doing they
[58:14] were lacking Zoe they were lacking the
[58:16] true power of Pentecost and an evil
[58:21] spirit prevailed over them you find it
[58:27] so many times a day that men are
[58:30] prevailed over by evil spirits because
[58:33] there's no life there there's no life to
[58:37] back up what they're saying but the
[58:39] Bible tells me in Hebrews 11 and 6 that
[58:41] without faith it is impossible to please
[58:44] him for he that cometh to God must
[58:48] believe that he is and that he is a
[58:51] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[58:53] them you see without faith you can't
[58:55] please God he is the one that created
[58:58] the heavens and earth he is the creator
[59:02] he that cometh to God must believe that
[59:05] he is the creator you see faith in God's
[59:07] Word equals power faith in God's Word
[59:11] moves
[59:11] Alton's faith in God's Word catches the
[59:14] revelation of this message faith in
[59:17] God's Word
[59:18] shake the kingdom of health faith in
[59:20] God's Word brings the promises to pass
[59:23] faith in God's Word brings God to your
[59:25] need faith in God's Word tells you that
[59:28] I can do all things through Christ who
[59:30] strengthens me faith in God's Word tells
[59:35] you that this is the victory that
[59:36] overcometh the world even our faith your
[59:39] faith will tell you that by His stripes
[59:42] we are healed it's a time that we got to
[59:46] fight for it and contend for the faith
[59:52] are you with me or not it's a time to
[1:00:04] start fighting for what you believe in
[1:00:07] there's gonna be people that walk right
[1:00:09] beside you that will not believe this
[1:00:11] but it's an evidence it's an evidence
[1:00:15] that there's a mother lode there may be
[1:00:19] you've been that I'm preaching to you
[1:00:21] just for a moment
[1:00:22] I'll get back over I'll get back over
[1:00:25] here on one of the things of God where
[1:00:27] you who you all crucify me but maybe
[1:00:29] maybe had been you'd have been raised in
[1:00:31] the message being a great basically
[1:00:34] great raised from diapers all the way up
[1:00:36] in the message but you ain't never had
[1:00:38] that true Pentecostal experience you see
[1:00:41] what you need is that good old-fashioned
[1:00:43] dying out sin kill and religion we're an
[1:00:46] old-fashioned Pentecostal experience
[1:00:48] comes into your life and makes this
[1:00:50] message real and you start speaking to
[1:00:52] your mountains and you start speaking to
[1:00:55] the storms in your life and you start
[1:00:57] speaking and you watch and you will you
[1:00:59] start speaking to that red sea and watch
[1:01:01] the red sea you start speaking to the
[1:01:03] mountains in your life the reason why
[1:01:05] people don't speak to their mountains is
[1:01:07] because they love looking at the
[1:01:09] mountain because they love and enjoy the
[1:01:11] mountain that is standing before them
[1:01:13] but you ought to have a desire to get
[1:01:15] rid of that sin in your life you ought
[1:01:17] to have a desire to kick the devil out
[1:01:22] stop falling in love with the devil that
[1:01:25] you're sleeping with and start kicking
[1:01:27] him out hello somebody it's time because
[1:01:35] it's the rapture is here Jesus said in
[1:01:45] John 14 believers now not that I'm in
[1:01:48] the father and the father mean the words
[1:01:50] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[1:01:54] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[1:01:56] me he doeth the works believe us me that
[1:02:00] I'm in the father and the father in me
[1:02:02] or else believe me for the very works
[1:02:03] sake verily verily I say unto you that
[1:02:06] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:02:09] do shall he do also and greater works
[1:02:11] than these shall I do because I go unto
[1:02:13] my father and whatsoever he shall ask in
[1:02:16] my name that will I do that the father
[1:02:19] may be glorified in the son that if you
[1:02:22] shall ask anything in my name I will do
[1:02:28] it when I said it and nothing came to
[1:02:31] pass all hail was against this truth
[1:02:34] all hail was against this revelation our
[1:02:37] guns are pointed against this message
[1:02:39] it's just a proof of what we've got
[1:02:46] brother you just let something on the
[1:02:49] phenomenal side start and watch how
[1:02:50] every rogue hound inhale goes to
[1:02:52] hollering at him craving blood I tell
[1:02:55] you Peter preached the sermon on the day
[1:02:57] of Pentecost that three thousand souls
[1:02:59] were saved and the devil never even
[1:03:01] moved out of his bed that's right oh
[1:03:03] well let them alone but he passed
[1:03:06] through the Gator called beautiful the
[1:03:08] next day and healed a man crippled from
[1:03:11] his mother's womb and all hail turn
[1:03:13] loose on him throwed him into jail
[1:03:16] kept it in there overnight put him in
[1:03:18] the prison in the inner cell because the
[1:03:20] phenomenon the devil said I can't let
[1:03:22] this thing get started now divine
[1:03:24] healing if they do they're really
[1:03:27] knocked my props out from under me
[1:03:29] that's right because I might fool them
[1:03:30] around with a little theology once in a
[1:03:33] while but I sure can't fool that real
[1:03:35] thing that comes out and the people see
[1:03:37] it done I've just stopped this before
[1:03:40] the group gets on the scene and they
[1:03:43] never stop the death and they can't stop
[1:03:47] it now God's gospel will move home and
[1:03:50] all at home and when there is no more
[1:03:53] heavens and when there is no more earth
[1:03:55] that word will still remain the same
[1:04:01] Satan's tried to throw up every blow to
[1:04:04] a rock but blow dry road blocking his
[1:04:06] way in the way of this message and the
[1:04:08] message keeps running it over he's tried
[1:04:11] to raise every demonic power in front of
[1:04:14] it
[1:04:14] but the message keeps running at over
[1:04:16] why because it's a living God that is
[1:04:18] backing us up you and I wouldn't be here
[1:04:22] if it wasn't for a spoken word that
[1:04:25] placed us in this position Satan wants
[1:04:29] to destroy us he'd like to push us off a
[1:04:31] cliff I know where I'm standing that
[1:04:36] right now because he's here he wants to
[1:04:40] push you off a cliff and to keep you
[1:04:43] from believing this but he can't destroy
[1:04:46] you brother Donny because you are an
[1:04:49] eternal being you are not a carnal
[1:04:53] impersonator like those in acts 19 the
[1:04:56] is him yeah there's been a whole lot
[1:05:03] there's been a whole lot of fakes and
[1:05:06] counterfeits it was proven to us that
[1:05:08] there is a real Virginia wine baptism of
[1:05:11] the Holy Ghost yeah a bunch of donkeys
[1:05:13] bunch of donkeys can't prove where they
[1:05:15] came from but some mules can't prove
[1:05:18] where they came from why because they
[1:05:20] ain't got no pedigree
[1:05:22] they just ha ha around because they
[1:05:25] don't know who the mammy is and they
[1:05:27] don't know who their poppy is but I love
[1:05:30] a good genuine thoroughbred horse that
[1:05:32] knows who their father is knows who
[1:05:35] their mama is they know where they came
[1:05:37] from and they know where they're going
[1:05:38] the devil tried telling me that I was
[1:05:41] going to hell but I didn't come from
[1:05:43] hell I came from God I'm going back to
[1:05:46] God let the heathen rage let he'll be
[1:05:51] against me let demons be against me so a
[1:05:55] hosting kept me I will not fear for this
[1:06:02] one thing I have desired to dwell in the
[1:06:05] house of the Lord forever he proved to
[1:06:10] you that hell was going to be against
[1:06:11] you but they will not overcome you but
[1:06:14] you will overcome it let the musicians
[1:06:23] go the one that overcome death hell and
[1:06:35] the grave is here the one that backs up
[1:06:40] his word is here if God was not in it he
[1:06:45] would not confirm it there's a little
[1:06:51] spotting in Nevada it's a little city by
[1:06:55] the name of Carly and there were
[1:06:59] thousands of settlers out there that ran
[1:07:02] through the city in Karlin while they
[1:07:07] were on their way to the gold rush
[1:07:09] many of them paying for gold in that
[1:07:11] city to no avail they've been through
[1:07:20] there they looked for it but they
[1:07:22] couldn't find it by penny they couldn't
[1:07:24] find no gold there so they just moved on
[1:07:26] and moved on and what would be one of
[1:07:30] the greatest gold deposits in the earth
[1:07:34] was laying right there they were walking
[1:07:38] right over top of it and here the
[1:07:42] greatest deposit of gold was
[1:07:44] undiscovered while everybody just kept
[1:07:47] walking past it today the minds of
[1:07:52] Carling of the Carlin Trend are among
[1:07:54] the world's largest and the richest gold
[1:07:58] producers the Carlin Trend has produced
[1:08:02] more than sixty million ounces of gold
[1:08:04] to date and many millions more are still
[1:08:08] lying in the ground waiting to be mined
[1:08:12] at today's market the gold would be
[1:08:16] worth Oh over 87 billion dollars they
[1:08:23] look for they paying for it they walked
[1:08:26] right over top of it but they couldn't
[1:08:29] find it but just because somebody else
[1:08:32] said that it wasn't there didn't mean it
[1:08:35] wasn't there
[1:08:37] just because somebody else says this a
[1:08:39] right doesn't mean it a right just such
[1:08:42] because somebody else don't want to live
[1:08:44] it just because somebody can't get the
[1:08:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost because they

[1:09:48] great price and I have sold everything I
[1:09:53] sold everything to buy this field to get
[1:09:57] this pearl well Satan is against me
[1:10:02] let him be against you let him biggest
[1:10:06] you I was reading an article this
[1:10:09] morning when I first got up about maybe
[1:10:14] a plant saw god bless your name tonight
[1:10:17] I was reading over his article in these
[1:10:19] these fisheries his fisheries were
[1:10:22] trying to figure out a way
[1:10:24] to keep the cod fish and they had been
[1:10:27] catching it taking it to take it to the
[1:10:31] spots of distribution how to keep it
[1:10:32] fresh and and then they tried freezing
[1:10:37] it but when they froze the cod and it
[1:10:39] lost its flavor they try putting it in
[1:10:42] live tanks and let it let it just swim
[1:10:46] till they got to its destination but
[1:10:48] they found that when they put these fish
[1:10:50] in lot of tanks and make the fish all
[1:10:52] mushy because it was just stagnant
[1:10:54] setting steel but finally they came up
[1:10:57] with an avenue to keep the fish fresh
[1:11:00] they put the fish in a live well and
[1:11:03] they were transported to their
[1:11:06] destination but in that destination when
[1:11:08] they would ship it to its spot they
[1:11:11] would put the enemy the codfish's enemy
[1:11:15] the catfish they would place it in the
[1:11:17] lab well with that caught fish and that
[1:11:20] catfish would chase that con fish all
[1:11:22] around that laughed that live whale and
[1:11:26] it would keep that fish fresh
