[41:12] one on tell me again look at Thomas yes

[41:26] Thomas
[41:56] yes

[42:21] and so amen sister Anna that was a
[42:24] phenomenal testimony I was sitting right
[42:27] right there since you told it last night
[42:28] it won't be me telling it so I was
[42:31] sitting right there and and uh her
[42:34] sister was down here at the altar and
[42:36] she Carly was down praying and the Lord
[42:39] spoke to me for something to tell her
[42:42] and uh and then to tell sister Anna and
[42:47] uh I didn't know what it all meant but
[42:50] tell her that it's a blockage it's a
[42:54] blockage and I told I told Carly
[42:57] and uh what was going on and then Anna
[43:01] was right beside of her praying and I
[43:03] said it's a blockage it's a blockage and
[43:05] I don't know the whole story but she
[43:08] went to the doctors to find out what the
[43:09] blockage was and it was a BL blockage to
[43:12] which that was holding her from getting
[43:15] pregnant and so they run the Dy up in it
[43:19] and they kept running the Dy in it and
[43:22] and uh they rolled her around and
[43:23] massaged her and all that different kind
[43:25] of thing and kept pressuring that with
[43:27] the die and it came
[43:38] open so today we can say it was a
[43:44] blockage I love it when it goes from
[43:46] it's a blockage to it was a
[43:49] blockage I once was blind but now I'm
[43:51] Healed I once was lame but now I'm

[44:36] while in the end of the Sabbath as it
[44:39] began to draw toward at the first day of
[44:42] the week Came Mary
[44:45] Magdalene and the other Mary to see The
[44:49] Seer and behold there was a great
[44:52] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[44:54] descended from heaven and came and
[44:56] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[44:59] sat upon it and his countenance was like
[45:04] lightning and his rment was white as
[45:09] snow and for fear of him that the
[45:12] keepers did shake and became as dead men
[45:16] and the angels answered and said unto
[45:19] the woman fear not
[45:21] ye for I know that you seek Jesus which
[45:26] was crucified
[45:27] I love these next
[45:30] words he is not

[50:55] us
[51:01] I want to speak to you on the
[51:04] indisputable it's a big word
[51:09] indisputable
[51:11] evidence of his
[51:19] resurrection we have an empty
[51:24] tomb we have an empty tomb that we can
[51:26] and point ourselves
[51:34] to brother brandom says he said now no
[51:38] matter how much he
[51:40] died and how pathetic his death
[51:45] was if there was no
[51:48] Resurrection he was just a
[51:51] man that
[51:52] died there has been many great men
[51:58] in our
[51:59] world that has made great
[52:01] claims for instance confusus the great
[52:05] Chinese philosopher died about 2300
[52:09] years
[52:10] ago Buddha the great prophet of Japan
[52:14] also died around 2300 years ago and and
[52:18] made great statements but he
[52:22] died and he remains in the grave there
[52:25] was m
[52:27] Mohammad the privilege of being at his
[52:30] grave were 2,000 years the great white
[52:34] horse that has stood at his grave
[52:37] changing guards every four hours
[52:40] expecting him to rise someday and ride
[52:43] the world down and Conquer it
[52:46] muhammadans which is the greatest
[52:48] religion in number in the world they
[52:51] outnumber all Christians and Catholics
[52:53] put
[52:54] together but muhamad
[52:57] is still in the
[53:00] grave all of these religions when we
[53:04] say Jesus is raised from the
[53:10] dead I want to say to you he's
[53:22] alive he says and today we're trying to
[53:26] the religions are trying to keep Christ
[53:28] in a
[53:31] tomb oh what an Easter Morning has done
[53:35] an Easter cannot keep him in the
[53:38] Tomb you can put him in a Methodist tomb
[53:41] or a Baptist tomb or a presbyterian tomb
[53:44] or whatever you want to but he raised
[53:47] out of that tomb and he is alive
[53:50] today I had a Baptist tomb and you might
[53:53] have had a Methodist tomb but one day
[53:55] Jesus Rose from there notice how he says
[53:58] it from a historical
[54:01] God to a living and present God that is
[54:06] alive forever
[54:10] more I just want to share an experience
[54:12] with you that happened just last
[54:15] week we we had the ray family with us
[54:19] and they stayed with us on Monday and
[54:21] Tuesday and they was in her home and of
[54:24] course they had places that they stayed
[54:26] at but but they came and and we did we
[54:29] did a few things and and so anyway on on
[54:32] Monday afternoon we were going to have a
[54:35] supper there at brother Andrew's house
[54:38] at in his garage and and uh as we were
[54:43] there and uh we were just talking for a
[54:46] little
[54:47] bit and uh brother Joel was there and
[54:51] and Brother Sam was there brother Tom
[54:54] was there few of the girls Sam's wife
[54:56] wife was there a few of the girls were
[54:58] there and sister Connie was was doing
[55:01] some cooking in the kitchen and she was
[55:03] coming in and out to hear the
[55:05] conversation and you know we had been
[55:07] talking about natural things and carnal
[55:10] things and and after a little while
[55:13] someone asked would you would you share
[55:15] a Supernatural
[55:16] story and so I went in and I picked up
[55:21] the the the little little trinket that
[55:25] you bought me brother Davey and Whitney
[55:27] that you bought me from Disney World and
[55:30] I said well this is just kind of how
[55:32] things work and and I said you can't
[55:35] make yourself have a vision you and God
[55:37] will sometimes put you in a pinch and so
[55:40] I just began the the talking about
[55:43] supernatural things and and I was
[55:46] standing with Isaac and Isaac was in my
[55:48] arms he was a little bitty fell at that
[55:50] time and we were looking out over the
[55:52] water at Epcot Center and as we was
[55:55] looking over the water and seeing the
[55:57] lights and and uh I had a vision that
[56:02] they bought me a Beauty and the Beast uh
[56:05] statue and it had little little sparkles
[56:08] all over it and it was just a beautiful
[56:11] piece and uh I didn't say anything about
[56:14] it and I I noticed when they came from
[56:17] shopping they didn't have any any bags
[56:20] and so they begin to exchange gifts
[56:23] after we got home and I told Connie
[56:25] about what I saw and uh so
[56:29] anyway anyway I I thought you know when
[56:32] that devil starts whispering in your ear
[56:35] I'm telling you this for a reason and he
[56:37] starts whispering in your ear it was
[56:40] just you it was just your thought it was
[56:44] just you know it wasn't really and you
[56:47] know you missed it this
[56:51] time was it a couple months
[56:54] later they came came over to the house
[56:57] and the family was there and uh it was a
[57:00] cardboard box they said Dad we've got
[57:03] this for you and I said well being
[57:06] you've got it for me I I think I need to
[57:09] tell you what's in the box
[57:14] amen now you better be
[57:18] right you better be
[57:21] right or all your family will re lose
[57:25] respect of the vision and what the word
[57:27] is said that's right and so I said uh
[57:32] it's a beauty in the Beast it's a it's a
[57:35] little
[57:36] statue and it's in a blue
[57:39] box he knows what's in the
[57:43] box and that's that's what I heard him
[57:45] say he knows what's in the
[57:48] box and so I opened it up and I and
[57:51] there it was and I opened it and there
[57:53] it was and you know for me it was a pH
[57:55] phenom Al moment so I was sharing that
[57:59] then I was sharing a few other
[58:00] Supernatural things about the Louisiana
[58:03] meeting and and I was sharing some other
[58:05] things that was going on and and the
[58:08] Lord had spoke to me of what to tell the
[58:11] three boys and because 19 of them had
[58:15] came to this
[58:17] meeting you know they had a
[58:19] phenomenal had a phenomenal difficulty
[58:22] of of trying to decide could we all come
[58:25] and then when it all come together it
[58:27] just happened in a couple of days the
[58:29] rooms came open everybody got a ticket
[58:32] on the same plane
[58:35] 19 19 got a ticket on the same plane and
[58:39] they got a one-way trip each way and
[58:42] they flew from Vancouver to Washington
[58:44] DC I didn't even know that was available
[58:46] and so and so they was able to fly here
[58:49] and I was praying in my office and and I
[58:53] said Lord they're not here just for any
[58:55] reason you've got a reason for them to
[58:57] be
[59:00] here and after a little while the Lord
[59:02] dropped something in my heart just
[59:05] something that was Sovereign right in my
[59:08] heart well I knew I just couldn't tell
[59:10] the two boys Joel and Sam I had to have
[59:14] Michael there and so Michael walks into
[59:19] the room he comes into the house and
[59:21] then I knew all the pieces were
[59:24] together you know the script RT said
[59:26] that these signs shall follow them that
[59:29] believe it's not us it's
[59:32] Jesus and so uh after these stories I
[59:36] told them and they was just enjoying
[59:38] that they said they could have listened
[59:39] to it for quite a while and you kind of
[59:42] know what I'm talking about Tom and
[59:43] Melissa you came to my house the other
[59:45] day and bopped in for a few minutes and
[59:47] thought you'd be there and two and a
[59:49] half hours later you finally left and we
[59:52] were just so glad to have
[59:54] you and so when you just heart talking
[59:56] about him he comes by and so and then I
[1:00:00] just I I I just begin to tell them this
[1:00:03] is what the Lord told
[1:00:05] me and when I did it was a pillar of
[1:00:09] fire dropped right out of that
[1:00:11] Chandelier and came and just hung right
[1:00:14] about like
[1:00:15] that now it wasn't enough just for me to
[1:00:18] see it but all of a sudden the presence
[1:00:21] of God just begin to envelope that
[1:00:24] room and they fell on their knees and
[1:00:27] wept and cried and screamed to the
[1:00:30] Lord there was a young lady that was
[1:00:32] sitting there and I just I just asked
[1:00:34] her I said have you ever been in
[1:00:36] anything like this in your life and she
[1:00:38] said no brother Ron I've never been in
[1:00:41] anything like
[1:00:44] this and I told her I said you can be
[1:00:46] filled with the Holy Ghost right here
[1:00:49] and in that
[1:00:51] moment God filled that young girl with
[1:00:54] the Holy Ghost
[1:00:56] and it just swept around the room and it
[1:00:59] just swept around the
[1:01:07] room you guys remember when we was in
[1:01:11] Louisiana Adam and his dad and Andrew
[1:01:14] had drove me to
[1:01:15] Louisiana and and we was in the cabin i'
[1:01:19] went to get
[1:01:21] prayer and and I went to get prayer and
[1:01:25] you know no lightning or thunder took
[1:01:28] place but when he dropped in the room
[1:01:31] brother Adam was filled with the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost brother Tim's two grandson
[1:01:36] Timothy's two boys were filled with the
[1:01:39] Holy Ghost right there and I came home I
[1:01:41] hadn't been able to go to work for for
[1:01:44] months because of the cancer and the
[1:01:47] chemo when I came home I I haven't
[1:01:50] missed a
[1:01:51] day and that's been almost four years
[1:01:54] ago and isn't God
[1:02:03] wonderful now I I'm setting myself up
[1:02:06] just for a little
[1:02:08] bit because either you believe or you
[1:02:11] don't
[1:02:15] believe either you believe or you don't
[1:02:18] believe many of tourist have went and
[1:02:21] looked into the Tomb of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:25] brother Billy Andrews was one that that
[1:02:28] stands out to me he stood in this pull
[1:02:30] pit and said that when he went to
[1:02:32] Jerusalem and and the God took him down
[1:02:35] to the tomb he said I jumped that rope I
[1:02:39] went in there and I laid down and the
[1:02:41] man was screaming you can't be in there
[1:02:42] you can't be in there he said I want to
[1:02:44] lay where my Lord
[1:02:52] laid
[1:02:54] now these girls had
[1:02:57] been had been transformed by his
[1:03:01] presence when we talk about Mary
[1:03:05] Magdalene she was a woman that was
[1:03:07] possessed with
[1:03:09] demons she was a woman that had been
[1:03:11] transformed by the presence of Jesus
[1:03:14] Christ in one moment possessed toward
[1:03:18] not even the community wanted to have
[1:03:20] nothing to do with her and when Jesus
[1:03:23] comes into her life she becomes a Lady
[1:03:26] of Grace and becomes a follower of Jesus
[1:03:30] Christ with all of the other disciples
[1:03:33] and the other ladies that were with them
[1:03:36] but I find it
[1:03:38] phenomenal of all of the women that were
[1:03:43] Believers it is instructed for her to be
[1:03:47] at the
[1:03:49] tomb that Jesus after he
[1:03:54] raises he will speak to her
[1:03:58] first as I was thinking the other day
[1:04:00] when Jesus Ares he didn't go to a
[1:04:04] castle he didn't go to the king's
[1:04:07] Chambers to prove that he was alive he
[1:04:09] didn't go to the
[1:04:13] synagogue he went to his
[1:04:16] seed he went to real
[1:04:20] Believers that's what we have found
[1:04:24] today it's not the sizes of some great
[1:04:27] big church and some great big Cathedral
[1:04:30] or any government Sinners cuz they don't
[1:04:33] want
[1:04:34] him they've taken the Ten Commandments
[1:04:37] off of the walls they've decided we
[1:04:39] don't need God anymore but I want you to
[1:04:43] know tonight he's welcome
[1:04:52] here now you must remember Jesus
[1:04:56] he made incredible
[1:04:59] statements he began to say I and my
[1:05:03] father are one that's really why he
[1:05:05] would be crucified when he said I am God
[1:05:09] are one because listen if he's God then
[1:05:14] all of those other Pharisees and
[1:05:17] Sadducees he's not one of them if he's
[1:05:20] God we've missed the whole picture
[1:05:24] here he said I have power to lay my life
[1:05:28] down power to take it up again he said I
[1:05:33] am the resurrection and the
[1:05:38] life I and my father are
[1:05:41] one he cried in John chapter
[1:05:45] 17 I have finished the work that thou
[1:05:49] has given me to
[1:05:51] do he prayed in in the Garden of
[1:05:55] Gethsemane
[1:05:57] father if it would be thy
[1:06:00] will let this cup pass from
[1:06:05] me now let me just say this to you now
[1:06:09] if he doesn't go to Calvary and raise
[1:06:12] again you and I are
[1:06:16] lost if he doesn't pay the price of
[1:06:18] redemption you and I are without
[1:06:22] hope and you say how do you know he
[1:06:24] lives
[1:06:26] he lives in
[1:06:28] us that's enough proof for
[1:06:33] me
[1:06:35] brother John chap 20 and verse 11 but
[1:06:39] Mary stood without the seler
[1:06:42] Weeping and as she woop wept she stooped
[1:06:46] down and looked into the Seiler and see
[1:06:49] two
[1:06:50] angels in white sitting the one at the
[1:06:53] head and the other at the feet
[1:06:56] where the body of Jesus had laay and
[1:06:59] they said unto her woman why weepest
[1:07:03] thou and she said unto them because they
[1:07:06] have taken away my Lord and I know not
[1:07:09] where they laid
[1:07:11] him and when she had thus said she
[1:07:14] turned herself back and saw Jesus
[1:07:18] standing and knew not that it was
[1:07:23] Jesus and Jesus saith unto to her woman
[1:07:26] why weepest thou whom seekest why
[1:07:30] weepest thou whom seekest thou and she
[1:07:33] supposing him to be the gardener saith
[1:07:35] unto him sir if thou hath borne him
[1:07:39] since hence tell me where that thou Hast
[1:07:43] laid him and and I will take him away
[1:07:47] and Jesus saith unto her
[1:07:51] Mary
[1:07:53] Hallelujah aren't you thankful when he
[1:07:56] called your
[1:08:00] name and she turned herself and sath
[1:08:04] unto him
[1:08:07] rabona which is to say
[1:08:10] master in that moment all of the
[1:08:14] prophecies everything that he had
[1:08:19] said now went to another
[1:08:22] level and she was standing in a very
[1:08:27] sacred
[1:08:30] moment
[1:08:32] raona and Jesus saith unto
[1:08:35] her touch me
[1:08:38] not for I am not yet ascended to my
[1:08:42] father but go to my brethren and say
[1:08:47] unto them I Ascend unto my father and
[1:08:51] your father and to my God and your God
[1:08:57] and Mary Magdalene came and told the
[1:09:00] disciples that she had seen the Lord
[1:09:03] that he had spoken these things unto
[1:09:11] her you ever went to your job and tried
[1:09:14] to talk about a supernatural
[1:09:19] service you ever went to a place and
[1:09:22] tried to tell somebody else about what
[1:09:24] was a service was like last
[1:09:28] night it doesn't have the same
[1:09:32] meaning but when you're
[1:09:36] there but when you're standing in the
[1:09:39] presence when it's changing your
[1:09:43] life and you know that you know that you
[1:09:46] know that you know that you know that
[1:09:49] you
[1:09:52] know he's not a historical God but he's
[1:09:56] right here in this moment he's in my
[1:09:59] bedroom he's in my
[1:10:01] kitchen he's in the pub aside of me he's
[1:10:05] all over
[1:10:07] me and I just want more and more of
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:19] him now
[1:10:22] remember the church leaders
[1:10:26] had said now he's had some statements
[1:10:28] that he's made and I just rehearsed them
[1:10:31] to you destroy this Temple and I'll
[1:10:35] raise it up in three
[1:10:42] days they had saw the lame walk the dumb
[1:10:46] talk the leopards Lazarus
[1:10:52] RS they had seen him walk on water
[1:10:56] they had seen him do phenomenal things
[1:10:58] that they could not explain
[1:11:02] away they attacked him by the law and
[1:11:05] they attacked him about a lot of
[1:11:06] different things but somewhere in the
[1:11:10] Deep amen they knew there might be
[1:11:13] something to
[1:11:14] this so they went to pilate and said now
[1:11:18] this man has said all of these
[1:11:20] things he said all these things and and
[1:11:23] we would like for you to guard the
[1:11:27] tomb and send guards to the tomb isn't
[1:11:30] that just like the Devil he's seen
[1:11:33] things take place in your
[1:11:36] life and they'll send the Warriors
[1:11:39] against you just in case it's
[1:11:42] right oh you might last six months you
[1:11:45] might last two years but you know you
[1:11:47] might you know and you begin to work on
[1:11:49] your mind and battle inside of you but
[1:11:53] listen when that's ignited inside of
[1:11:55] your life that se Gene of God there's no
[1:11:59] going
[1:12:03] back I don't care what the devil says
[1:12:06] but there's no going
[1:12:09] back because that is God living on the
[1:12:12] inside of you it's no more man trying
[1:12:15] it's God
[1:12:16] trying and when you would give up and
[1:12:19] when you would quit something on the
[1:12:22] inside of you raises up
[1:12:37] I can imagine some of these bewildered
[1:12:44] disciples where do we go The Treasure of
[1:12:47] the church hung
[1:12:49] himself Peter's denied the
[1:12:54] Lord
[1:12:55] he's denied the
[1:12:58] Lord he's blasphemed he's cussed like
[1:13:02] Blasphemous
[1:13:05] words they hung our
[1:13:08] leader they beat him until his organs
[1:13:10] showed through his body they cursed him
[1:13:14] and they didn't even allow him to hang
[1:13:16] in decency on the cross they stripped
[1:13:19] him and gambled for the garments that he
[1:13:22] wore they put a thorns on his head they
[1:13:25] even put a plaque over top of him King
[1:13:27] of the Jews and that was
[1:13:35] right you're talking about wanting to
[1:13:36] quit
[1:13:45] church now there was two
[1:13:49] boys that decided to take a walk they
[1:13:52] was going back to their home
[1:13:57] and as they begin to go
[1:14:00] back and they're walking and they're
[1:14:04] discouraged they're tore all to
[1:14:08] pieces they're headed back to
[1:14:13] EMAs and I'm sure in their thoughts they
[1:14:15] didn't know what in the world was going
[1:14:17] to go
[1:14:18] on I love the scripture that says and
[1:14:21] Jesus Drew
[1:14:23] near yeah
[1:14:28] you ever had him to draw
[1:14:30] near and you just know he's in the
[1:14:33] room you know he's in the
[1:14:35] room and he drew
[1:14:39] near they didn't recognize him because
[1:14:42] the pressures of life in that mortal
[1:14:45] body he looked well past 50 years
[1:14:48] old he was strained because he was
[1:14:51] carrying the sins of the world but now
[1:14:54] in that new body they couldn't recognize
[1:14:57] him you may not be able to recognize me
[1:15:00] and my new
[1:15:03] body and I may not be able to recognize
[1:15:06] you in your new body but just say a few
[1:15:11] words just say a few words Hey Brother
[1:15:14] Jim how are you doing
[1:15:18] buddy just say a couple of words now he
[1:15:22] begins to talk to them
[1:15:26] and he's asking himh are you
[1:15:28] discouraged now they're so discouraged
[1:15:31] they don't recognize his voice think
[1:15:33] about that you can get into a place to
[1:15:36] where you're so discouraged when Jesus
[1:15:38] comes he has to talk to you for a
[1:15:43] while it's a six-hour
[1:15:47] walk and he begins to talk to him did
[1:15:51] did he not do
[1:15:53] this did he not fulfill the scriptures
[1:15:57] did he not fulfill this and and it goes
[1:15:59] through all the scriptures did he
[1:16:01] fulfill this yes he did did he fulfill
[1:16:03] this yes he did and he spoke to them
[1:16:06] about what the prophecy said about him
[1:16:10] and he was asking them Believers did he
[1:16:13] fulfill
[1:16:16] it did Elijah fulfill what he supposed
[1:16:19] to do in this day and I believe we could
[1:16:22] say yes he did he did I'm going to take
[1:16:25] you a step further did the Bride of
[1:16:27] Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ just before the Rapture did she
[1:16:39] fulfill and he begins to talk to them he
[1:16:43] talks through them he begins to deal
[1:16:45] with
[1:16:47] them and you know as he comes to a
[1:16:49] certain point he's going to go buy their
[1:16:52] house and the scripture say that they
[1:16:55] constrained
[1:16:59] him come here
[1:17:01] Shannon come
[1:17:05] here you're going by and you want to
[1:17:08] make sure that he don't leave so you
[1:17:11] grab a hold of him oh you grab a hold of
[1:17:15] you've enjoyed this last six hours but
[1:17:17] you want him in your home amen now just
[1:17:20] don't give a little talk grab a hold of
[1:17:23] him amen and you pull on him God you're
[1:17:27] welcome in my house I I want you to come
[1:17:29] in and spend the evening with us
[1:17:39] amen now he walks into their house and
[1:17:42] he begins to spend and they're going to
[1:17:44] break some bread brother vest they're
[1:17:46] going to break some bread and and jesus
[1:17:49] takes his
[1:17:52] position and he tooks it and he put it
[1:17:54] in in his hands in a certain
[1:17:57] way and he begins to break the bread and
[1:18:00] the scripture said their eyes were
[1:18:06] opened their eyes were opened you know
[1:18:10] up to that point it's like a cat that
[1:18:13] can't
[1:18:14] see and he can't see and he stumbles
[1:18:16] into things but once your eyes come
[1:18:20] open once your eyes come open to the
[1:18:23] word there were scripture there that you
[1:18:25] tried to understand it you tried to
[1:18:28] understand it you tried to understand it
[1:18:30] you read it you read it through
[1:18:32] denominational filters and you read it
[1:18:34] through all different kind of filters
[1:18:36] and you tried to read the Bible and you
[1:18:38] couldn't make any sense of it but God
[1:18:40] puts his glasses on
[1:18:43] you and then the same scripture you
[1:18:45] couldn't see all of a sudden comes to
[1:18:53] life
[1:18:55] and all of a sudden that stranger is the
[1:18:59] Messiah he's no longer in a
[1:19:02] tomb he's no longer
[1:19:05] dead we have experienced the evidence of
[1:19:08] his
[1:19:09] resurrection he stood in our home he
[1:19:12] stood at our table he broke the
[1:19:18] bread did not our hearts burn within us
[1:19:23] while he spake to us along on the
[1:19:25] [Applause]
[1:19:39] way the scripture in 1 Corinthians
[1:19:42] chapter 15 says it like this verse
[1:19:48] one I want to remind
[1:19:51] you who's writing this Paul
[1:19:56] if I could give you just a little
[1:19:58] history for a
[1:19:59] moment he was
[1:20:05] Saul he was a denominational
[1:20:08] believer he was
[1:20:11] militant brother
[1:20:13] Doug he was so
[1:20:15] entrenched he was headed to be a high
[1:20:20] priest his
[1:20:23] assignment was to go and put this
[1:20:26] testimonies listen we finally got Jesus
[1:20:30] off of the scene but just as soon as we
[1:20:32] got Jesus off of the scat all these
[1:20:34] testimonies are
[1:20:38] starting all they the upper room started
[1:20:40] and then 3,000 was saved and they're
[1:20:42] being baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:20:45] Jesus Christ and and all of these people
[1:20:47] are being healed and all these things
[1:20:49] the lame man at the gate he's
[1:20:51] alive we got to put this out
[1:20:55] and he took papers and he got them
[1:20:57] arrested and put many to death there was
[1:21:01] a young man named Steven that was the
[1:21:03] scripture said was full of the Holy
[1:21:06] Ghost he was a a late teenager man and
[1:21:09] he was full of the Holy
[1:21:11] Ghost and they were going he was going
[1:21:13] to put him to death and Stephen stood
[1:21:17] there before that Council and explained
[1:21:19] the message of the
[1:21:21] hour it was prophecy it wasn't Moses it
[1:21:26] wasn't all the other
[1:21:28] prophets it was
[1:21:31] prophetic but
[1:21:34] Jesus Jesus is the Messiah that's him
[1:21:39] it's fulfilled in Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ he had a coat
[1:21:53] on
[1:21:56] and that coat went into Saul of Tarsus
[1:21:59] his
[1:22:01] hands and he stood there and held that
[1:22:09] coat while Steven was
[1:22:12] being put to
[1:22:14] death and Steven said I see Jesus
[1:22:21] standing I see him standing what a realm
[1:22:26] being put to death but can look into
[1:22:29] that Heavenly
[1:22:32] realm Saul couldn't put it all
[1:22:36] together but this would never leave
[1:22:39] him the look on his face would never
[1:22:42] leave him the countenance him standing
[1:22:45] in Two Worlds being put to death and
[1:22:47] seeing God at the same
[1:22:49] time it would never leave
[1:22:53] him
[1:23:00] now it was an
[1:23:02] event that would be with
[1:23:05] him Stephen they're they're on the
[1:23:09] way he's got papers to go arrest more
[1:23:12] and put more to
[1:23:14] death and they're on the road and he's
[1:23:17] got guards with
[1:23:18] them and all of a
[1:23:21] sudden this great church leader is
[1:23:25] struck off of his
[1:23:27] horse and there was a pillar of fire
[1:23:30] Hallelujah that stood before him and he
[1:23:33] could identify this as being
[1:23:36] God because God met Moses in a pillar of
[1:23:42] fire he met Ezekiel in a pillar of fire
[1:23:46] along with other prophets in a pillar of
[1:23:48] fire now it's his
[1:23:50] turn now it's his turn to meet him in a
[1:23:54] Pillar of
[1:23:55] Fire and out of that Pillar of Fire God
[1:23:59] begins to speak to him and begins to
[1:24:02] tell him I am
[1:24:08] Jesus none of the other guards saw
[1:24:12] it none of the other people saw it it
[1:24:16] was to him now I'm coming to
[1:24:19] you you're in a service and God deals
[1:24:23] with you and changes your life in a
[1:24:26] moment and you walk out and say that's
[1:24:28] the greatest service I've ever been in
[1:24:30] my life none of the other people felt
[1:24:32] what you
[1:24:34] felt you went home and told your family
[1:24:37] none of them felt what they felt you go
[1:24:40] to your job and none of them felt what
[1:24:42] you felt but you
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:49] know did I did I ring that for you did I
[1:24:53] get that for you
[1:24:56] word is sent
[1:25:00] to to one of the Disciples of the Lord
[1:25:04] and he begins to actually argue with God
[1:25:07] God this
[1:25:09] man has done much trouble to the
[1:25:13] church this man has put many to death
[1:25:17] and now you're asking
[1:25:19] me to go expound the word to
[1:25:23] him
[1:25:27] because people know your history they
[1:25:29] can't believe your

[1:50:21] cab
[1:50:30] for him and guys like brother Wayne and
[1:50:32] brother Bill and brother Leo and pillars
[1:50:35] of this church I could go on and on but
[1:50:38] listen listen Sister Sarah all of those
[1:50:40] Believers and they and they go from this
[1:50:43] Dimension to another dimension what a
[1:50:48] miracle what a miracle that it is not to
[1:50:51] have to lay and
[1:50:54] suffer but to step from this Dimension
[1:50:57] to another
[1:50:58] dimension into a well
[1:51:01] body and to
[1:51:04] Fellowship in that
[1:51:10] realm here we
[1:51:12] are sitting here this
[1:51:17] morning and we're listening to the
[1:51:21] word now
[1:51:28] I hope I can do this
[1:51:30] right it's kind of like sitting with
[1:51:33] Jesus and I'm not comparing myself with
[1:51:34] Jesus but it's kind of like sitting with
[1:51:37] Jesus and talking to
[1:51:40] them about Resurrection
[1:51:44] morning telling them about things that
[1:51:47] are going to go on and you're sitting
[1:51:49] and you're listening to him well it's
[1:51:52] well brother Josh it's a good sermon but
[1:51:55] you're not stepping into it as a matter
[1:51:56] of fact some things we just don't catch
[1:51:59] until we're there in the
[1:52:05] moment and he assigns Mary to come to
[1:52:09] the
[1:52:10] Grave he didn't assign
[1:52:12] pilot or Kings or high
[1:52:18] priest
[1:52:20] Mary a woman that had had had a
[1:52:23] horrendous
[1:52:27] past a woman that a lot of people were
[1:52:29] still saying a lot of things about I'd
[1:52:32] like for you to
[1:52:33] come and and and anoint the body because
[1:52:38] he needs somebody to
[1:52:41] witness he needs somebody to be the
[1:52:45] witness that can say I was
[1:52:51] there I was
[1:52:55] there I saw the Angels no you didn't I
[1:52:59] saw the Angels was it a myth I saw the
[1:53:05] angels I sat in Full Gospel

[1:56:18] right
[1:56:21] here
[1:56:34] I could sing but I better
[1:56:36] not talk about
[1:56:46] me me oh
[1:56:51] my so somewhere between sermons all
[1:56:54] these great preachers and the event the
[1:56:57] devil's going to work on
[1:57:00] you I'm preaching to you whether you
[1:57:02] know it or not I'm trying to help you
[1:57:05] whether you know it or not but on that
[1:57:10] morning on that morning you may have
[1:57:12] served the Lord 50 years on that morning
[1:57:15] prophecy and time
[1:57:18] intercepts and the evidence of the
[1:57:21] Resurrection begin to take C hold of
[1:57:23] your
[1:57:24] body there was moments that God proved
[1:57:26] himself to you by healing you of sugar
[1:57:28] diabetes healing you of cancer healing
[1:57:31] you of different things in your life and
[1:57:33] making a way where there seemed to be no
[1:57:35] way paying bills that you couldn't dare
[1:57:38] pay and you proved him to be a real God
[1:57:41] to you but on that
[1:57:48] morning I lost my track but I'm going to
[1:57:51] go back and do it again
[1:57:54] yeah
[1:57:56] First Corinthians 15 and
[1:58:02] 51 sorry to have held you so
[1:58:05] long behold I show you a
[1:58:08] mystery we shall not all
[1:58:11] sleep but we shall be
[1:58:18] changed I want you to know I believe
[1:58:25] it in a
[1:58:28] moment in the twinkl of an
[1:58:30] ey at the last trumpet for the trumpet
[1:58:33] shall sound and the dead in Christ shall
[1:58:37] be raised
[1:58:39] Incorruptible and let me just add that
[1:58:41] to you it's going to be
[1:58:44] undisputable and we shall be changed for
[1:58:47] this
[1:58:49] corruptible must put on incorruption and
[1:58:52] this Mortal must put on
[1:58:56] immortality so when the corruptible
[1:58:59] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:59:01] Mortal shall have put on put on
[1:59:03] immortality then shall be brought to
[1:59:05] pass a saying that is written
[1:59:08] death read the lesser of this with me
[1:59:12] death is swallowed up in
[1:59:21] Victory
[1:59:29] oh death where is thy
[1:59:31] sting oh grave where is thy Victory The
[1:59:35] Sting of death is sin and the strength
[1:59:37] of sin is the law but thanks be to God
[1:59:40] which giveth us the victory through our
[1:59:42] Lord Jesus Christ read this next verse
[1:59:45] therefore my beloved Brethren be a
[1:59:49] steadfast unmovable always a abounding
[1:59:52] in the work of the Lord for as much as
[1:59:54] you know that your labor is not in vain
[1:59:59] in the
[2:00:00] Lord Give the Lord a great big hand
[2:00:02] right
[2:00:14] there brother Ron I don't believe it
[2:00:16] hang
[2:00:18] around brother Ron do you believe that
[2:00:20] Mary Magdalene saw him absolutely 100% I
[2:00:24] do just as much as I know that Thomas
[2:00:28] put his
[2:00:29] hand in his
[2:00:32] sight listen I I preached this about a
[2:00:35] year to you let me just rehearse it for
[2:00:37] you one more time what an incredible
[2:00:40] event that took place he said Mary don't
[2:00:42] touch me I haven't ascended to my father
[2:00:45] yet listen time doesn't matter too much
[2:00:48] to
[2:00:50] God and in just a few few hours he's
[2:00:53] gone and then he comes back to be with
[2:00:58] Copus on the road to
[2:01:00] aess and breaks bread with them and then
[2:01:05] he comes to the disciples that are all
[2:01:07] weary and all nervous and all tore up
[2:01:10] because he wants them to have the
[2:01:11] evidence of the Resurrection Thomas was
[2:01:14] doubting and he said notice he couldn't
[2:01:16] be touched then but now he
[2:01:19] can Thomas
[2:01:22] don't you put your hand in my
[2:01:24] side
[2:01:26] yeah it's where the sword went
[2:01:30] in Titus put your hand up put in
[2:01:34] there that's what Thomas did he put his
[2:01:37] hand in in his
[2:01:40] side and Jesus sat
[2:01:42] down you know what he
[2:01:47] did he had
[2:01:49] honeycomb Hallelujah and he had
[2:01:54] fish and they
[2:01:56] ate you talking about having time at
[2:02:00] church and then Jesus disappeared I've
[2:02:03] always wondered what happened to the
[2:02:05] fish in the
[2:02:10] honeycomb some of you get it today some
[2:02:12] of you get it
[2:02:16] tomorrow but in the moment in the
