[0:30] let the young people take notice to this
[0:33] that all take notice - Aaron never give
[0:38] it is Jerry Savelle the only occasion he
[0:42] only asked the energy and that Jesus
[0:45] might do some kind of a trick
[0:47] take a rabbit out of the hamper you know
[0:50] or something you thought he might be in
[0:52] otherwise he regarded as like a magician
[0:55] we've heard that you can do pranks
[0:58] let me see you do your prank now yeah I
[1:01] say this is Reverend but how many times
[1:05] have so-called ministers of this day
[1:07] yeah is it if there be a Holy Ghost if
[1:13] you believe that the Holy Ghost is just
[1:15] like it was in the beginning let me see
[1:18] you take old so-and-so over here this
[1:21] all this manner where this one will get
[1:22] audible get him
[1:23] let me see you perform do they realize
[1:28] that that's the same spirit no they
[1:30] don't
[1:30] that's them - Jesus if that'll be the
[1:33] Son of God make these stones bread if
[1:35] thou be the Son of God tell us you hit
[1:37] you on the head if you're a prophet tell
[1:39] us who hit you with a rag around his
[1:40] face hit him on the head in his pants to
[1:42] stick wonder there said tell us if
[1:44] you're a prophet
[1:45] tell us you hit you will bleed you then
[1:48] tell us uh if you're the Son of God
[1:52] we're honest to our heart if you're the
[1:54] Son of God come down off the cross and
[1:56] we'll believe you're the Son of God
[1:57] I wonder if many people today both men
[2:01] women young and old are not standing in
[2:03] that same spot and you're going to
[2:08] remember some day but you were in his
[2:12] presence that is found
[2:16] I want to see a prank I want to see a
[2:21] traitor
[2:22] something other that makes me a bleep
[2:23] then you have a shiver over my back
[2:25] nothing you do this or that I'll believe
[2:27] him some sensation plain idolatry then
[2:35] you're you know Jesus said in one case
[2:38] he asked a question I like to ask the
[2:42] church tonight this Jesus said Wow Wow
[2:49] why do you call me your Lord and do not
[2:54] the things that I command you to do why
[2:57] could you call me Lord and keep up my
[2:59] word why can't you call me Lord and deny
[3:03] the things that I've commanded you to
[3:05] preach and teach what is it what does it
[3:09] it's the cow there's some denominational
[3:13] traditions stands between that and the
[3:17] world and anything it stands between you
[3:20] and God is an idol it takes the place of
[3:24] God Lord means ownership Lord owns the
[3:33] property and if God owns me if I am his
[3:39] and he turned me around they put us on
[3:43] the wrong road they call me for a
[3:47] purpose but to fulfil his desires I like
[3:54] it how can I do anything else let me
[3:59] keep it when you call me long

[45:05] that lady that so encouraged each and
[45:08] every one of us to just reach out in
[45:10] faith and maybe we can't grab ahold of

[45:14] touch the hem of his garment as he's
[45:16] passing my and maybe you don't
[45:19] necessarily have the strength to get
[45:21] through the rest of the crown but maybe

[51:15] and all what a victory it is a man god
[51:21] bless you this morning good to see you a
[51:24] man we love you with all of our hearts
[51:27] and and thank you for your prayers and
[51:31] continued prayers and and we just love
[51:36] you I'm just so honored to stand here
[51:39] with you and to feel just just honored
[51:43] to be among you and miss those that
[51:45] can't be with us but but we're glad that
[51:47] you could be here and thank you for the
[51:50] all the inconveniences you're having to
[51:52] go through to to be here but we're
[51:56] thinking you for your your strengthen
[51:59] your your tolerance with things and and
[52:02] we appreciate we appreciate everything
[52:05] we love you this bug has just did a
[52:08] whole number on a lot of things and so I
[52:11] even going to McDonald's as a difficult
[52:14] thing and so I'm just I'd like to just
[52:19] be done with it but looks like there's a
[52:21] there's a wave of it that's coming back
[52:24] through and it's very very dangerous
[52:26] wave so don't relax too much there's a
[52:30] lot of sickness that is still among us
[52:33] and so a couple things that just like to
[52:36] pass to you that I think that that it's
[52:40] already been told to you in one respect
[52:43] that we have we just canceled our Labor
[52:46] Day services this year and really hate
[52:50] to do that but it'd be real difficult to
[52:53] have 500 people on this hill under these
[52:57] conditions and then try to orchestrate
[53:00] the hotels and make sure they're clean
[53:03] and the restaurants and have them open
[53:06] and all of that so appreciate that
[53:08] brother Joe green this is the first year
[53:12] that I know of that our Labor Day
[53:14] convention has been canceled brother Joe
[53:17] greens meeting the mission meeting it
[53:21] has been cancelled as well
[53:23] and so just to make you aware of those
[53:26] things if you have got a motel room I'd
[53:28] go ahead and get that cancelled in and
[53:31] even picnics that's what's really
[53:33] aggravating to me when we had it sister
[53:37] Brenda when we have to start canceling
[53:39] picnics a it's a sad it's a sad day amen
[53:47] amen we love you with all of our hearts
[53:50] I'd like for you to pray for dear friend
[53:53] of mine sister Karen Brooke and she's
[53:56] she's had a real difficult time
[53:59] struggling with a she had two previous
[54:02] brain brain bleeds that they were able
[54:05] to catch and do medicine with but this
[54:09] was massive to which that they had to go
[54:12] in and do some work - and so she the the
[54:19] doctor was able to to get it stopped for
[54:23] just for bit and and looks like they've
[54:27] got these places taken care of but she
[54:30] hasn't spoken as of yet so we need a we
[54:34] need a miracle and not only do we need a
[54:37] miracle we understand that that kind of
[54:40] condition is you live with a sword over
[54:43] your head the rest of your life because
[54:45] it's just not in one place it's all over
[54:48] and so we believe that God can heal her
[54:52] and so a man I understand some of that
[54:56] you know you you know when you get that
[54:59] conversation to where the doctor says
[55:01] we've we've we've got to stop for right
[55:05] now but it could happen in another
[55:08] second and we don't give you the promise
[55:11] of tomorrow
[55:12] and so when brother Tim got that speech
[55:15] he told me yesterday said you know when
[55:20] we were just having the conversation you
[55:22] could hear it different in his voice he
[55:25] said she lives with a sword over her
[55:27] head
[55:28] I said brother Tim you know now you've
[55:31] got sister Karen with that and you have
[55:34] me with that and so we really need you
[55:37] now a man so we we certainly appreciate
[55:42] brother Tim Pruett and his wife and
[55:45] family and church and what they mean to
[55:47] us here just want to read you a report
[55:51] or just give you a report Wednesday we
[55:53] went to the doctor and and and we had
[55:57] had two previous MRIs and an MRI on the
[56:01] liver and they they did they told us
[56:04] that I have no cancer in my liver or my
[56:09] pancreas
[56:13] that's very
[56:16] [Applause]
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:22] some thankful for that and so we if we
[56:28] can get it out of that brain but at
[56:30] least in all of this brother Nathaniel
[56:33] there's a couple of things that has been
[56:35] proved I have a heart and I have some
[56:42] brains and so you know so we've got some
[56:47] good things that I mean just cause it's
[56:51] got plants are close to it it proves
[56:54] that I do have it so simple things we
[56:57] love you we thank you where the doctor
[57:01] told me this week we are fighting cancer
[57:05] amen
[57:07] I just want to leave the best till the
[57:09] last here and of course the fight is on
[57:15] and I'll take chemo for for however long
[57:18] it takes and that's eight pills a day
[57:19] and that's a struggle and it's a that's
[57:23] what we continue to struggle with and
[57:25] where we got a real fight on our hands
[57:28] so don't quit praying so and every day
[57:32] is different you take your medicine one
[57:34] day and it reacts one way you take your
[57:36] medicine the next day and it reacts
[57:38] another way and so amen and so yeah and
[57:42] and here's the deal here's the greatest
[57:45] part of the but all when you feel a nap
[57:48] coming on you've got to take it because
[57:50] it's the healing process so should I get
[57:54] about 15 minutes in this morning and you
[57:58] feel the NAP coming through me and you
[58:02] feel like going to sleep you understand
[58:05] it's the healing process
[58:07] [Applause]
[58:21] a man so at home with a home with the
[58:24] family there when all the sudden the the
[58:27] shade starts coming down Paul Paul just
[58:30] goes to sleep everybody understands Amen
[58:35] I'll try to understand if you go to
[58:36] sleep today and so a man we love you
[58:40] with all of our hearts he's good to a
[58:45] Sydney I just about missed a mark the
[58:50] doctor was talking to me about the liver
[58:52] lines and they said it said that there's
[58:55] a line that's in the liver that they
[58:57] watch and it's the the cells that are
[59:01] leaving the body dead cells and they
[59:05] said that's really interesting in cancer
[59:07] patients that we really watch for that
[59:11] to take place since one of the things
[59:13] that we wants to happen in in the liver
[59:17] that happens in and said yeah this might
[59:21] be some good news for you said you have
[59:24] an inordinate abnormal amount of dead
[59:28] cells leaving your body
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:35] that's good maybe same that's good
[59:40] that's good news
[59:45] oh yeah amen amen amen
[59:58] god bless you I probably get more
[1:00:00] concerned about you know I told sister
[1:00:04] Connie I said probably my complex is as
[1:00:06] I've got this chipmunk look and she said
[1:00:10] it'll be okay you know so sister Mamie
[1:00:16] would like these cheeks to grab ahold of
[1:00:20] because when we first got married
[1:00:22] brother Terry remember those days she'd
[1:00:25] grab her cheeks is that not bad enough
[1:00:29] amen man god bless you thank you for
[1:00:34] allowing me the opening comments this
[1:00:36] morning and I'll do my best not to be
[1:00:39] long but if you turned with me this
[1:00:41] morning I have a few things I just want
[1:00:43] to share on my heart I thought last
[1:00:48] night and if you haven't got to hear it
[1:00:50] but I thought last night was one of the
[1:00:52] most tremendous sermons I've ever heard
[1:00:54] on the heart Andrew that was so awesome
[1:01:09] Philippians chapter 3 and verse 13
[1:01:19] and like first all to put herself in
[1:01:22] this these places today I want to speak
[1:01:28] from my heart again I've kind of changed
[1:01:31] the way I look at speaking so I want to
[1:01:36] speak from the heart today I want to
[1:01:39] speak to you on the man in the arena and
[1:01:43] I know that I will not get done but but
[1:01:47] I would like to give you about 30 35 40
[1:01:50] minutes of that if that would be
[1:01:51] suitable it said okay brother
[1:01:54] brother ray says the we're mind can only
[1:01:57] take them in what the sea can bear so I
[1:01:59] think that's good I think that's good
[1:02:02] admonition Philippians 3 verse 13 this
[1:02:07] is Paul brethren I count not myself to
[1:02:11] have apprehended but this one thing that
[1:02:15] I do forgetting those things which are
[1:02:19] behind and reaching forth unto those
[1:02:23] things which are before I press towards
[1:02:29] the mark of the prize of the high
[1:02:32] calling of God in Christ Jesus first
[1:02:39] John chapter 4 in verse 4 and and we can
[1:02:44] probably repeat it without it by mine
[1:02:47] thought says year of God little children
[1:02:50] and have overcome them because greater
[1:02:54] is He that is in you than he that is in
[1:03:00] the world
[1:03:02] Amen let's pray Almighty God we love you
[1:03:07] with all of our hearts today and Lord we
[1:03:10] ask you now that you would come and
[1:03:12] anoint your servant of the Lord that you
[1:03:15] would help me to just kind of get myself
[1:03:18] out of the way for a few moments lord
[1:03:21] give me wisdom to know how to handle the
[1:03:24] strength that you would give me just now
[1:03:26] thank you for what you delivered to us
[1:03:29] last night we asked your father that
[1:03:33] you'd speak to us bless this audience in
[1:03:37] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[1:03:41] amen amen brother Andrew and brother
[1:03:44] Matthew give me some water you can be
[1:03:47] seated we were sitting at the table last
[1:04:00] night and one of my nephew's was there
[1:04:03] and he looked over at me and he said
[1:04:05] brother
[1:04:06] he said Ron has anybody ever told you
[1:04:11] you look like Teddy Roosevelt I said
[1:04:20] well you know this morning I have an
[1:04:21] interesting thing that you would say
[1:04:23] that too but uh but I'm going to read an
[1:04:27] excerpt from a speech this morning it
[1:04:32] was one of his greatest speeches that he
[1:04:34] would ever ever speak and and he became
[1:04:38] famous for the saying he said it is not
[1:04:44] the critic who counts thank God for that
[1:04:51] not the man who points out how strong
[1:04:55] how the strong man stumbles or when the
[1:05:00] doer of Deeds could have done them
[1:05:03] better the credit belongs to the man who
[1:05:08] is actually in the arena it's not the
[1:05:16] one that's up there that's everybody's
[1:05:19] wanting to give their point of view
[1:05:22] because there's a lot of people come to
[1:05:25] the arena there's a lot of people walk
[1:05:29] in and take their seats and they're on
[1:05:32] one side of the other
[1:05:35] in life there's a lot of monday-morning
[1:05:38] quarterbacks we live in an age that
[1:05:42] everybody's got an opinion in an age
[1:05:46] that everybody's got a thought on the
[1:05:48] process so I want to just as I set that
[1:05:55] format just for a moment it's not the
[1:05:57] critic that counts not the man who
[1:06:01] points out the strong man stumbles or
[1:06:04] where the doer of Deeds could have done
[1:06:09] it better the credit belongs to the man
[1:06:13] that is actually in the arena whose face
[1:06:16] is marred by dust and sweat and blood
[1:06:23] who thrives strives valiantly who errs
[1:06:27] who comes short again and again because
[1:06:33] there is no effort without error I like
[1:06:38] that statement there's no effort without
[1:06:41] error listen let me just say the only
[1:06:45] man that's never made a mistake with
[1:06:47] Jesus and everybody else that says they
[1:06:52] haven't made a mistake hasn't done
[1:06:54] anything
[1:07:02] who knows great enthusiasms the great
[1:07:07] devotions who spends himself in worthy
[1:07:11] cause Who at best knows in the end the
[1:07:16] triumph of high achievement and who at
[1:07:20] the worst if he fails at least he fails
[1:07:26] while daring greatly so his place shall
[1:07:32] never be with those cold timid souls who
[1:07:37] knew who never know victory or defeat
[1:07:45] this sermons been coming for a couple of
[1:07:48] months so I just wanted to share some
[1:07:52] thoughts that I have on my heart
[1:07:56] statements that we have made from this
[1:07:58] pulpit that now is is is very pertinent
[1:08:03] to the hour that we live in because we
[1:08:08] are in a time of the world is changing
[1:08:11] not just America but the world is
[1:08:14] changing we are headed toward the
[1:08:18] Tribulation Period or the rapture
[1:08:22] there's a resurrection that is laying
[1:08:25] right in front of us the message has
[1:08:29] been preached the message has been
[1:08:34] delivered that message has went around
[1:08:38] the world and we've had phenomenal men
[1:08:42] carry the message translate the message
[1:08:45] the message the bright people have been
[1:08:49] gathered and will continue to be
[1:08:51] gathered the work is not done but let me
[1:08:55] just say there's change on the horizon
[1:09:00] [Applause]
[1:09:01] we are enjoying our last services and
[1:09:05] things are different let me just say to
[1:09:08] be shut in and closed in in to our homes
[1:09:13] let me just say for us it has not been
[1:09:15] prison as the Bride of Christ it's not
[1:09:20] prison I don't mind not having to be
[1:09:24] able to go to McDonald's in the morning
[1:09:26] to get my coffee I don't mind being shut
[1:09:29] in my house a little bit I married my
[1:09:33] best friend a man I'm glad your amens
[1:09:39] were good amen I married my best friend
[1:09:44] I have a family that don't fast don't
[1:09:46] fight try wood they don't gossip they
[1:09:49] don't do all of those things I like
[1:09:51] quiet
[1:09:52] peaceable life amen
[1:09:59] but we've made statements from the
[1:10:01] pulpit here refuse to retreat refuse to
[1:10:11] retreat there is no give up inside of us
[1:10:19] I'm saying that from a level of fighting
[1:10:22] cancer
[1:10:23] I refuse to quit
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:37] last week we sister Colleen or a couple
[1:10:41] maybe this week during the night this
[1:10:45] week by Sunday night last Sunday night
[1:10:51] after preaching and was preaching
[1:10:53] there's a lot of emotions to you and
[1:10:56] sister Connie we went to bed and and
[1:11:02] just shortly thereafter I I went to bed
[1:11:05] early and would sleep and and when she
[1:11:08] got into bed she said it looked like I
[1:11:11] was totally awake and she said that I
[1:11:15] spoke to her and said I'm stopping my
[1:11:18] treatments I'm not taking any more
[1:11:21] treatments and it just tore her up
[1:11:24] because that's something that we've said
[1:11:27] we're gonna finish this and and I
[1:11:30] understand why people quit I understand
[1:11:34] I understand why people quit I don't
[1:11:36] have any I don't want to throw a rock
[1:11:38] but I understand why people say I can't
[1:11:42] take this anymore this therapy is just
[1:11:44] too difficult I understand brother Andy
[1:11:47] you can attach to that some of you here
[1:11:51] that can attach to that it's it's a
[1:11:54] difficult chemo is a difficult process
[1:11:57] and so I told her that an hour later and
[1:12:03] I told her that an hour later three
[1:12:07] different times during the night I said
[1:12:09] I'm quitting and I'm quitting so I got
[1:12:13] up and she just walked the house with
[1:12:15] the floors all night because she
[1:12:18] couldn't tell if I was asleep or I was
[1:12:21] awake and she just didn't want to be
[1:12:24] confrontational during the night with me
[1:12:26] and so we were sitting at the table the
[1:12:29] next morning and she says was he serious
[1:12:33] about what you said last night I said
[1:12:36] what did I say last night I probably
[1:12:40] need to know but I what I said last
[1:12:42] night
[1:12:45] and so as if I confessed any major sins
[1:12:50] era and I said what did I say she said
[1:13:05] you said you were quitting the therapy
[1:13:08] and I said absolutely not
[1:13:11] she said you said it three times about
[1:13:15] three about an hour apart and said it
[1:13:18] just tore me up all the during the night
[1:13:20] that's it I had to be the devil even in
[1:13:26] my sleep he wanted to attach in a fight
[1:13:30] but I refused to give up
[1:13:44] but I now I wanted to speak of not timo
[1:13:47] therapy but I refused to quit on serving
[1:13:53] God
[1:14:05] when you think about it in life as
[1:14:07] Christians we're were called to battles
[1:14:11] Psalms like onward Christian soldiers
[1:14:14] are written because we are people that
[1:14:18] war and we will be faced many battles in
[1:14:22] her life but we thank God that God has
[1:14:26] counted us worthy to stand the test and
[1:14:33] when the scripture says he are of God
[1:14:37] God allows himself to be put on trial
[1:14:44] it's not your flesh that he's got
[1:14:48] confidence in it's the god part of you
[1:14:53] that he's got confidence in that he'll
[1:14:57] see you through now we realize as Paul
[1:15:03] would say we're we are not sufficient of
[1:15:07] ourselves to think of ourselves of
[1:15:10] anything but it's a sufficiency of God
[1:15:16] for he he'd asked God that God would
[1:15:19] deliver him of the trial thrice but the
[1:15:24] scripture says that God's words back to
[1:15:28] him was my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:15:34] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:15:37] weakness most gladly therefore I will
[1:15:41] rather glory in my infirmities but that
[1:15:45] the power of Christ might rest upon me
[1:15:50] in Isaiah chapter 40 and verse 29 the
[1:15:58] scripture says he gives power to the
[1:16:01] faint and to the them that have no might
[1:16:06] he increaseth their strength even to the
[1:16:12] use shall faint and weary and young men
[1:16:16] shall utterly fall
[1:16:17] but notice these next words but they
[1:16:20] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:16:22] their strength this is not your battle
[1:16:28] this is God's battle our problems is is
[1:16:41] when we take a hold of the reins and
[1:16:44] fight for our self then but God reminds
[1:16:52] us over and over again this is not your
[1:16:54] battle so we must stand off and applaud
[1:16:59] God at fightin the battle through our
[1:17:02] flesh some one another there was a
[1:17:07] choice that was made a choice that God
[1:17:11] chose that we're going to have a battle
[1:17:13] Satan we're going to have a battle your
[1:17:18] flesh might have been placed as the man
[1:17:21] in the arena today the scripture that we
[1:17:27] all love here no weapon that is formed
[1:17:30] against thee shall prosper and every
[1:17:36] tongue that shall arise against thee and
[1:17:38] the judgment that will shalt condemn
[1:17:42] this is the heritage of the servants of
[1:17:45] the Lord and their righteousness is of
[1:17:48] me saith the Lord I want to thank God
[1:17:54] that just like the man in the arena
[1:17:58] we're all familiar with a sports world
[1:18:02] to where that different teams are there
[1:18:06] and people go and you it's always good
[1:18:08] to see your children hit a home run ER
[1:18:11] get to play or whatever they do we must
[1:18:16] encourage them and strengthen them and
[1:18:19] stand there with them and many times we
[1:18:22] with them many times in the Christian
[1:18:25] world we watch our brothers and sis
[1:18:27] go through some incredible trials and
[1:18:31] you think well why did they have to go
[1:18:34] through that why did they go through
[1:18:38] such deep dark trials in their life why
[1:18:42] it seems like that some people skate
[1:18:44] through and never have a trial never
[1:18:47] have a test never have a situation in
[1:18:50] their life
[1:18:52] many times it's hey I got a text
[1:18:55] yesterday morning and it was a text
[1:18:59] aware that if you could clean the sin
[1:19:01] out of your life you'll be healed I
[1:19:06] thought that was an interesting take on
[1:19:09] things but I thought that was nice that
[1:19:12] they would send it to me and and make it
[1:19:14] so personal if you could get the sin out
[1:19:17] of your life let me just be don't go on
[1:19:20] record
[1:19:20] I prayed over and over and over about
[1:19:22] that and as I look back in life I am
[1:19:27] I've came through a lot of turmoil I
[1:19:31] they're not either doughnut if they're
[1:19:37] right if we're traveling and I dare not
[1:19:41] either doing that I'll get a call from
[1:19:43] sister Connie what you do it so I had
[1:19:52] brother Homer sister Connie and God that
[1:19:54] has watched over me but many times the
[1:20:00] comforters are like jobs comforters who
[1:20:03] sand or what have you done many people
[1:20:08] set up in the balcony and they're
[1:20:11] willing to shuffle you a million
[1:20:14] scriptures or maybe give you all kind of
[1:20:18] organic things that'll fix you right up
[1:20:21] and make your head spin
[1:20:25] or maybe kind of give you some guidance
[1:20:28] about how to talk and how to be more
[1:20:31] positive and and maybe how to think
[1:20:34] you see most of the people sitting in
[1:20:37] the stands
[1:20:43] that are watching their favorite
[1:20:46] athletes do no push-ups run no laps they
[1:20:55] don't do any exercise I'm gonna preach
[1:20:58] to you for just a little bit I'm over
[1:21:01] exterior but just in life they're
[1:21:09] willing to give all kinds of advice to
[1:21:14] others but I've always watched in life
[1:21:19] and this is where this come to it makes
[1:21:21] such a difference when you're the one in
[1:21:25] the arena it makes such a difference
[1:21:32] when you leave the stands and it's you
[1:21:53] Paul would say it like this no you're
[1:21:57] not that they which run in a race run
[1:21:59] all but one receiveth the prize so run
[1:22:05] that you may obtain and every man that
[1:22:09] striveth for mastery is temperate in all
[1:22:11] things and they do it to get a
[1:22:16] corruptible crown but we an
[1:22:19] incorruptible Paul now is addressing
[1:22:26] himself as the man in the arena out
[1:22:29] there for so run not as uncertainly so
[1:22:34] fight I not as one that beateth the air
[1:22:41] but I keep under my body and bring it
[1:22:46] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:22:50] when i have preached to others i myself
[1:22:55] should be a castaway merely sunday made
[1:23:01] a statement that was astounding to me
[1:23:03] that i i I thought it was something that
[1:23:07] I always wanted to hold in the back of
[1:23:09] my mind Billy Sunday was a an incredible
[1:23:12] baseball player then became an
[1:23:14] incredible preacher brother random talks
[1:23:16] about Billy Sunday but when it came to
[1:23:19] the end of his journey he said I've led
[1:23:21] thousands of souls to Christ and my
[1:23:25] family went to hell I think we need to
[1:23:33] be very responsible to our family in
[1:23:39] Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21
[1:23:42] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:23:48] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:23:52] overcame and him sat down with my father
[1:23:56] in his throne
[1:23:59] overcome is to prevail in the war that
[1:24:04] you have been given all of us are not
[1:24:08] given the same war brother Brennan would
[1:24:15] state use a statement he took him up on
[1:24:17] the mountain and set him down and he
[1:24:25] rebuked him again with the word Jesus
[1:24:30] defeated Satan with the Word of God
[1:24:34] showing that the witnessed of Christian
[1:24:39] can defeat Satan with thus saith the
[1:24:44] Lord so regardless of your battle
[1:24:53] regardless of your battle and I would
[1:24:55] say every one of us in here have a
[1:24:58] battle every one of us have a battle I
[1:25:08] can't overcome your battle for you I
[1:25:15] just can't
[1:25:16] I'd like to overcome your battle for you
[1:25:19] I can't overcome sister Connie's battle
[1:25:26] every one of you have a battle and God
[1:25:32] gave you the best weapon he could give
[1:25:34] you when he gave you the Word of God God
[1:25:41] does not have to reinvent the word to
[1:25:45] see if it will work for your situation
[1:25:47] or does it change from century to
[1:25:51] century or decade to decade or from year
[1:25:56] to year it does not have an expiration
[1:26:00] date to it
[1:26:03] [Applause]
[1:26:12] Jesus defeated Satan with thus sayeth
[1:26:17] the Lord showing that the weakest of
[1:26:21] Christian how many gets reminded by the
[1:26:24] devil that you are the weakest of
[1:26:27] Christian in that church down there well
[1:26:30] I want to tell you some really good news
[1:26:32] this morning he's alive he's never told
[1:26:38] the truth sometimes you look at your
[1:26:46] children and you go over my job my job
[1:26:48] my job the worst child in this building
[1:26:53] I don't know who it would be but the
[1:26:55] worst child in this building it's ten
[1:26:59] thousand times better off now I'm
[1:27:14] getting ready to preach and without and
[1:27:16] if you just give me a little leeway were
[1:27:17] here had a sister send me a letter for a
[1:27:25] weeks ago you know I don't know but I
[1:27:31] keep every letter every card I keep I
[1:27:35] keep everything I'm a hoarder of those
[1:27:40] things but there's a sister that has
[1:27:44] been she's about she's in her I don't
[1:27:47] know how her AIDS I don't want to get in
[1:27:49] danger she may hear this sermon I'm sure
[1:27:51] she will but she still works she's I
[1:27:55] would say she's older than me let me say
[1:27:59] that let me just go that by quite a bit
[1:28:03] she's lost her entire family so I think
[1:28:07] let me just advance I think she's I
[1:28:10] think she's advanced into her 70s and
[1:28:13] she still works two jobs because she
[1:28:16] can't make it
[1:28:19] she works at a department store selling
[1:28:22] clothes and then she works at another
[1:28:25] job lost her husband her son and her
[1:28:31] family members so she's the only one
[1:28:33] left she goes to to a church there in
[1:28:38] Lima Ohio and she writes me a letter and
[1:28:42] she's done this consistently for years
[1:28:46] and she writes me a handwritten letter
[1:28:50] and and generally it runs between twenty
[1:28:53] and thirty pages and I get one every two
[1:29:01] weeks and always has a card in it it
[1:29:06] says I'm thinking of you praying for you
[1:29:08] she's done this for years literally for
[1:29:12] years and sister Connie can tell you
[1:29:15] that I sat down and read every word that
[1:29:19] she says because she sent some very nice
[1:29:22] things and very encouraging things four
[1:29:26] weeks ago she wrote me something that
[1:29:29] stirred my heart and she knows that were
[1:29:32] the season that were in she understands
[1:29:35] the things that are going on and she
[1:29:37] wrote me this she says brother run I met
[1:29:42] you preaching in 2003 on God's champions
[1:29:50] that were the final voice to the final
[1:29:53] age and we must overcome and were
[1:29:57] champions of this day and she says no
[1:30:02] brother Ron she says I heard that in
[1:30:06] 2003 and she said you've been in this
[1:30:10] battle with cancer for months now
[1:30:14] she said it's time to be the champion
[1:30:31] it was in a season God sends you words
[1:30:35] in a season to where that your your your
[1:30:39] your you're coming to a spot to where
[1:30:42] that you're struggling your humanity and
[1:30:46] it was one of those Sikkim French
[1:30:50] moments and I was sitting at my desk and
[1:30:55] I I read that brother on it's time for
[1:30:59] you to be a champion here's a woman
[1:31:03] probably weighs 110 pounds soaking wet
[1:31:06] working two jobs to be able to make it
[1:31:10] yet she can write me 40 pages a month to
[1:31:14] tell me she loves me and she's she says
[1:31:18] I'm your biggest fan
[1:31:19] maybe she is I don't know for sure but
[1:31:25] when that little lady screamed out to me
[1:31:28] it's time for you to be a champion
[1:31:33] something on the inside of me triggered
[1:31:38] are you with me and the next quote that
[1:31:43] I read reading the property says if if
[1:31:46] we had to stand alone standing for it's
[1:31:52] God's word every man that ever has got
[1:31:56] anywhere had to stand alone on the
[1:31:59] convictions alone only that's not a
[1:32:02] that's not in a partnership there's only
[1:32:07] one who will walk with you that that
[1:32:11] that's him who made the statement the
[1:32:16] Lord Jesus he's the one that will draw
[1:32:19] the valley with you he will go with you
[1:32:22] through every briar patch
[1:32:26] and climb every mountain by your side
[1:32:30] yoked yourself up with him for my yoke
[1:32:34] is light my burdens are easy
[1:32:37] don't be yoked with the things of the
[1:32:39] world
[1:32:40] don't be yoked up with different
[1:32:42] societies and organizations or yoke
[1:32:45] yourselves singly with the Lord Jesus
[1:32:49] Christ hallelujah didn't it got to us
[1:32:59] can you understand me okay I'm
[1:33:07] struggling with the condition we're very
[1:33:10] tongues so I'm having quite difficulty
[1:33:13] with that forgiving me you mind if I
[1:33:18] just give you some personal notes now
[1:33:20] and then I'll be done
[1:33:30] my boys say that something happens to me
[1:33:32] they're gonna put me on a horse for a
[1:33:36] statue they're gonna have a statue may
[1:33:38] be put down here in the yard some of you
[1:33:41] thought some of you thought that we were
[1:33:43] cleaning the UH
[1:33:44] the barns up in the pine trees up and we
[1:33:50] were getting ready to what we're really
[1:33:52] looking for is a statue and the good
[1:33:58] news is is they they just tore Teddy
[1:34:01] Roosevelt down this week and that'll
[1:34:06] work that'll work real good we can just
[1:34:14] find the people that sell in that
[1:34:16] statute we we've got a place for it here
[1:34:27] we build statues to men and women and
[1:34:30] even little girls little boys and we put
[1:34:35] statues up because they have
[1:34:37] accomplished something you don't put a
[1:34:41] statue up because they didn't accomplish
[1:34:44] something in their life I don't care if
[1:34:48] this is going on social media or not
[1:34:50] it's just I'm gonna preach for three
[1:34:52] minutes
[1:35:00] the reason that statutes are put up is
[1:35:04] because men in their life did something
[1:35:07] that was worthy to look back and
[1:35:09] recognize that their life was worthy of
[1:35:12] remembrance they did it at phenomenal
[1:35:18] cost they did it at phenomenal risk
[1:35:22] whether it's George Washington Abraham
[1:35:25] Lincoln or Martin Luther King Nelson
[1:35:29] Mandela Neil Armstrong whoever it would
[1:35:32] be they did it at incredible cost I'm
[1:35:35] not willing to go the moon thank God
[1:35:37] somebody decided that you needed to go
[1:35:40] Thomas Jefferson if we could mail some
[1:35:48] statutes tonight we could build some de
[1:35:51] Peter James and John and seven
[1:35:55] messengers that stood out on the ages
[1:35:57] and preachers under them that step to
[1:36:01] the challenge of the hour and at great
[1:36:03] personal cost and phenomenal risk they
[1:36:08] preach the gospel of Jesus Christ men
[1:36:14] who died to give their life for the
[1:36:16] cause of Jesus Christ to preach the Word
[1:36:19] of God let me just say this to you many
[1:36:24] times people want to come along and wrap
[1:36:26] those statues they want to tear those
[1:36:29] statutes down they'd like to tag the
[1:36:33] cross down if they could then it would
[1:36:36] never be remembered of ever again but
[1:36:39] let me just say even in hell today that
[1:36:42] crosses a Raimondo
[1:36:47] that crosses our Amanda this is the spot
[1:36:52] that we was defeated and we lost the
[1:36:57] keys
[1:36:58] [Applause]
[1:37:17] and I want to remind mankind and all the
[1:37:20] demons in hell there's not a rope and
[1:37:22] there's not a chain big enough to tear
[1:37:25] down to call the cross of Jesus Christ
[1:37:38] there's a spirit on the earth to destroy
[1:37:41] headship others feared on the earth to
[1:37:45] destroy anything that had any
[1:37:48] resemblance of truth and to tear it down
[1:37:51] and and try to destroy it where is that
[1:38:01] spirit come from hell
[1:38:04] don't get yourself all caught up in that
[1:38:07] kind of a nonsense I'm gonna say a
[1:38:12] couple of things I wrote them down but I
[1:38:15] want to say it with and what I want it
[1:38:18] to land it is people that tear down
[1:38:22] those stains they're stupid people
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:34] they're void of brings your amen in me
[1:38:51] they have no appreciation for who or
[1:38:54] what we are I have said it before I say
[1:39:02] it now if you don't like America leave
[1:39:20] brother branham stood with america and
[1:39:23] he said i'm identified with her in her
[1:39:25] shame and in her glory i am not right
[1:39:33] and running for political office my
[1:39:35] office is much higher than politics
[1:39:38] I turned down politics many years ago to
[1:39:42] preach the gospel of Jesus Christ but I
[1:39:50] too AM identified with America and
[1:39:52] America has shamed but she has glory but
[1:39:58] I am a citizen of another country I am a
[1:40:05] citizen of another country identify with
[1:40:08] Abraham I identify with David identify
[1:40:14] with these other great men and I am a
[1:40:21] citizen under the citizenship of Jesus
[1:40:24] Christ you see my king is not by the
[1:40:29] Brenham it's not the men of all the ages
[1:40:32] although this message has produced some
[1:40:35] of the greatest preachers that has ever
[1:40:37] been on the face of the earth and if my
[1:40:41] voice be silenced tonight men like
[1:40:43] Andrew here don't a Reagan tim-tim
[1:40:47] Pruitt all across the land I'm not going
[1:40:50] to take the time to call all my favorite
[1:40:52] preachers these men's mouths as much as
[1:40:55] Satan would love to hush their mouths in
[1:41:00] this discredit them you can't stop the
[1:41:04] Word of God from going
[1:41:18] and when you see a man that's preaching
[1:41:22] the gospel in full force you don't
[1:41:24] realize all the things that he's had to
[1:41:27] go through in his life to be who he is
[1:41:31] you see there's a lot of people want to
[1:41:33] be that kind of a man but they're not
[1:41:36] willing to go through what that man had
[1:41:38] to go through to be that kind of a man
[1:41:52] the world is full of counts potatoes
[1:42:00] second guessers talking heads bloggers
[1:42:08] behind the computer the world is full of
[1:42:12] political agendas I got a note here
[1:42:16] while back that could that actually
[1:42:18] actually talked asked me what side of
[1:42:23] parties was on but because of what
[1:42:24] colored tide that I was wearing well let
[1:42:29] me just say that on my color of time for
[1:42:32] the suit is my chance if sister Carney
[1:42:37] says it's okay it's good the world is
[1:42:43] full of Monday morning quarterbacks who
[1:42:49] for the most part can't keep their facts
[1:42:52] straight now you thought I was talking
[1:42:58] about seeing in Fox ABC NBC well
[1:43:02] somewhat but let me expand all of this
[1:43:06] to weak pulpits
[1:43:09] that's why America's where she's at
[1:43:11] today
[1:43:14] who decades ago sold out to the will of
[1:43:18] man schools of their own think and now
[1:43:22] I'm getting ready to fight the lines in
[1:43:25] the arena you see if you show up in the
[1:43:28] arena you got to fight the lines you're
[1:43:34] not just down in the dust to get your
[1:43:37] picture taken so let me just fight for
[1:43:39] just a few seconds here because we are
[1:43:43] where we are we are reaping the benefits
[1:43:48] of wheat pulpits Deacon boards and
[1:43:54] schools of thinking who have tore the
[1:43:58] Word of God to shreds control by their
[1:44:04] own boards businessmen who want to
[1:44:07] promote a social fit gospel who is after
[1:44:14] sports education after things they want
[1:44:21] a preacher that will preach 20 minutes
[1:44:23] tell a joke have a scripture talk talk
[1:44:27] about the political events that's going
[1:44:29] on for the week and and get them out in
[1:44:32] time that their roasts will not burn
[1:44:39] they have built a modern church where
[1:44:44] you can sit in church and live with your
[1:44:50] sin on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[1:44:53] Friday Saturday and show up on Sunday
[1:44:57] morning and look a different part yes
[1:45:08] forward this to your friends
[1:45:12] to say this to you we have many that set
[1:45:15] behind our internet and listen to us
[1:45:17] preacher in our local area many of our
[1:45:22] own families are watching and watch
[1:45:25] every service I got an incredible letter
[1:45:30] from from Charles's mother and father
[1:45:32] this week and because of their age they
[1:45:35] can't come but there they're wonderful
[1:45:38] they're wonderful supporters of of
[1:45:40] encouragement to honor this church
[1:45:42] sister Mary and in Charles and sent me a
[1:45:46] wonderful letter even yesterday and
[1:45:49] they're at a point that they can't come
[1:45:51] or others that can't come and I'm glad
[1:45:55] the internet is available but just to
[1:45:57] put it on because of it it's good
[1:45:59] entertainment
[1:46:00] that's not enough that's not enough it's
[1:46:07] easy to watch from that arena get in
[1:46:11] your car get in your car and come here
[1:46:18] on Levin o'clock sat Sunday morning
[1:46:21] seven o'clock Saturday night
[1:46:30] let it be you a man's in your changing
[1:46:34] of your heart brother run but I'm afraid
[1:46:40] it'll change my wardrobe
[1:46:42] it will I'm afraid it'll change my music
[1:46:46] it will I'm afraid it'll change my
[1:46:50] friends it will bet it will put you in
[1:46:55] rapture ready condition friends Jesus is
[1:47:06] coming Jesus is coming the message has
[1:47:14] been delivered he is coming and in his
[1:47:16] own his way it is not a time to be couch
[1:47:20] potatoes second-guesses many churches
[1:47:32] sit with Ichabod on the door and the
[1:47:34] Spirit of God is never going to go back
[1:47:35] to they talk about a God that was 30 40
[1:47:40] 50 years ago or 200 years ago
[1:47:43] Ichabod has been written over the door
[1:47:45] because they turned the word down they
[1:47:50] turned it down they turned the Prophet
[1:47:52] down they turned the message down they
[1:47:54] actually turned the Bible down and
[1:47:56] rewrote it but thank God for people that
[1:48:00] will stand for truth in this day that
[1:48:04] will stand uncompromising that will
[1:48:07] preach it with passion men stood and
[1:48:16] told that the message was of the devil
[1:48:18] they will pay a cost for that
[1:48:22] they said don't go don't go to those
[1:48:24] brand new meetings don't go to the Homer
[1:48:27] Fraser's meetings don't go down those
[1:48:29] meetings down there they worship a man
[1:48:32] well pray tell me who you worship I'll
[1:48:36] tell you who he worship we worship Jesus
[1:48:39] Christ let's just get this real straight
[1:48:43] here tonight we worship the Lord Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ and
[1:48:52] [Applause]
[1:49:12] social distances is not a new term then
[1:49:17] weak pulpits have been preaching it for
[1:49:20] years Jesus asked for our life and he
[1:49:34] asked us to take work of our cross and
[1:49:35] follow him that's what he asked for
[1:49:41] I'm afraid my friends to leave me any
[1:49:45] friend that will lead you toward hell is
[1:49:47] not a friend any friend that I put beer
[1:49:53] to your mouth is not a friend then I put
[1:49:57] a drug in your hand is not a friend and
[1:50:04] if you're trying to impress that kind of
[1:50:08] brand of friend you're on the wrong road
[1:50:25] gonna say some just couple personal
[1:50:28] things now the devil comes to kill to
[1:50:34] steal and to destroy but Jesus came that
[1:50:41] he might give you lights at the end of
[1:50:50] the road
[1:50:50] I may not preach another sermon do you
[1:50:55] ever I don't know but at the end of the
[1:50:59] road when you come to that in spite what
[1:51:05] will you be remembered for
[1:51:12] really what will you be remembered for
[1:51:17] we talked about the man in the arena but
[1:51:21] what will you be remembered for
[1:51:30] they'll put me at statue brother Mike
[1:51:49] sits right here he writes me every week
[1:51:53] and tells me how much he loves me
[1:51:59] he's been my buddy all of these years
[1:52:04] calls me brother Ron I love you he sits
[1:52:16] in a man's place that sit there and
[1:52:20] danced and we enjoyed him and we enjoy
[1:52:27] being together but this is not the end
[1:52:34] this is not the end so as they come to
[1:52:40] the end of this first part I want you to
[1:52:43] think about something we watch all of
[1:52:48] them tearing all of those statutes down
[1:52:50] and sometimes brother Joe it grieves our
[1:52:53] hearts and we get on our soapboxes but
[1:53:01] at the end of the day what will I be
[1:53:03] remembered for
[1:53:14] it's quite a thought what have I done
[1:53:20] what did I accomplish what would I do
[1:53:30] what did I do
[1:53:32] was I constantly somebody else's gossip
[1:53:35] ear was I constantly putting somebody
[1:53:43] else down
[1:53:52] was I encouraged her was I strength
