TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you Alleluia so good to see you in the house of the Lord this evening a man we certainly love you with all of our hearts and a man I I believe we've got some folks from brother bisko's sister charity sister star so good to see you guys with us in the house of the Lord hunter it's good to see you a man each and every one of you brother soccer god bless you a man we have a very special friend with us tonight and and he's a buddy of mine in his name is Carlos and Carlos has been a friend he's a young man back in the back and he's been on he's been a long time coming and so I'm so glad to have him with us tonight and a man in his wife [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] so good to see you in the house of the Lord this afternoon a man's sister Gooden has had enough I think she's okay she's had an emergency and they're going to be checking on her and so thank you for your prayers with that amen good to be in the house of the Lord you know it's it couldn't be in a better place to have an emergency and so we just think the Lord for those things and God will just watch over to provide for us and be with us and amen and so if you see some lights they're coming to pick her up and take care of her and we thank the Lord for that and just be glad it's not you a man a man god bless you if you turn with me in your scriptures tonight I'd like to look to Psalms 23 how many enjoyed last night I tell you we had an awesome time here last night I thought brother we had a for speaker you call that a preacher quartet and so so last night we had brother Matthew and he just did a phenomenal job to start it out and then brother William has preached once more I just the way I could remember that just once more Lord and then brother Andrew came and spoke to us last night and we know what Andrew is capable of and so we just thank the Lord for that and we just I just like to just kind of take it from that point from last night to today and I'd say we'll have church amen amen we have read the scripture sin was sin so we were a child how many could say that that's true in your life that you've read Psalms 23 since you were a child it's more than a song it's more than poetry but it's a covenant between God and you if you'll remember God told Abraham I'll make a covenant between me and thee and when God says that it's infinite it it's not time-sensitive brother Josh and it's not you know it's not something that we just go well you know like a man will break his words but God says I'm making a covenant with you and so this is a song that is a covenant a man I'd like first to read it together if we can if we can do that the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters and he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with all my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever Psalms 27 and verse 1 says it like this the Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear I want you to say those words with me whom shall I fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire in his temple amen maybe you have a need tonight you just like say your brother Ron I'd like for the Lord to remember me this evening amen let's pray amen god bless you Lord Jesus we bow our heads before you now Lord with great need in our lives that you would sweep by our way now Lord we ask you to touch sister Sarah that you would touch her body she's in good hands even right now and lord I I just ask you that you would be with the family there watch over them those that are taking care of her bless them now we ask you Lord that you would sweep across this audience in a very supernatural way we pray that you would come on the scene for us this evening and strengthen our hearts and our lives Lord you're a god that's rich in mercy and the Lord as much as you have anointed us to prepare for this evening will Lord there's a people that's prepared to hear your word our hands defied gravity and then the define of gravity we reach to a God that hears and answers prayer now there's not a job too big or too small for you to handle and Lord we bring our needs before you in sincere devotion just now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and a man and a man you may be seated for a few weeks this has been on my heart and so this seems to be the night that to deliver it to you with all the circumstances are going on I think it's kind of interesting that this is our subject for the evening I want to speak to you on laying it all on the line laying it all on the line you see the lines define boundaries boundaries are fought over whether as a nation or as a state or as a county or municipality families properties are you with me now wars are fought over property lines and nations fight over even Antarctica and the Arctic Circle they fight over the walls and they fight over the different military powers and actually even in the media they fight over the boundaries of of what is what one of the most outstanding sermons is the greatest battle that's ever fought because when a man is to take place there is a choice of where the battleground is going to be at you see not to destroy populations or home territories but to to fight it on a neutral ground is where you contest the great two forces against one another you see God and Satan chose to fight in the Battle of a mind of a human being being that your flesh is never born again and there will always be a seeking for more of God your flesh contests with your soul that when that soul becomes ignited to where you really know who you are that you're a seed of God and there's no more argument all you may have been a drunk and you may have been a an addict and you may have been a lot of things in your life even religious fanatic but when you meet Jesus and he places his life on the inside of you that it's no more your desires living are you with me so even in this flesh there's boundary lines and Satan can fight with your flesh he can contest with your flesh in your flesh you have emotions you have you have all different kinds of feelings and seeing you here and Satan will bombard you in in all of those things and then he will go into your spirit there he can contest with your emotions and your your reasons and your conscience and and your memory now something you've been Christians for 50 years but I find it absolutely an amazing that Satan can reignite memories you can have a perfectly good day and all of a sudden you'll just get a clip in your mind you'll just kind of go go across like a TV screen and you'll bring up a picture of an old girlfriend or an old old situation of your life and oh my brother on that don't bother me well I've been with the light of you at restaurants and you know music can come on and that old time rock and roll and your foot no matter how converted you are your foot starts or you say well brother Ron I'm not moved by that we'll just talk about politics for about five minutes and you'll find out that you can walk into a realm though you almost were enraptured condition a few moments ago but you just start tampering with the realm of politics or the realm of the world you see it's which dog that you fight the most so there's lines that we can't cross there's lines that we must be careful with our nation has lines good bad ugly our nation has lines contested lines building walls that don't cure anything what we need to know fashion revival in our whole nation that's what we need hey man Aziz brother branham said he said it's it's the rottenness that's a manga see communism is going to take us over China isn't going to take this over it's the rottenness that's among us that's that's the real problem moments define us moments in our lives define who we are David could write these songs because he had met God as we would begin to look at last night and then we come to this line today you see Israel had been brought to a spot in their life to where that Satan had made a challenge and they come to the to a line to where that Israel was even they're either going to be the servants of the Philistines or the children of Israel was going to whip Goliath and to overcome him now now let me just say this to you it's easy when you can negotiate a you know a halfway and a compromise or negotiating sometimes that's what Christians do so-called they negotiate with the enemy and they'll give him a Sunday morning but they don't give him Monday Tuesday Wednesday saw was a backslidden King he was anointed he was chosen by the people they wanted a king like everybody else that he was a man that should have accepted the challenge he was a man that should have stepped up and said Goliath my god is real and he's able to take care of this situation but because Saul had broke the Word of God in his history he couldn't meet the devil on his grounds because God had rejected him and was now going toward another king that was coming that King wasn't 40 years old but he was a boy but that boy had had an experience with killing a lion and killing a bear and he knew God and he had been fellowship and God writing songs of Zion and the presence of God would sweep through his life and he knew the power or the inner workings of God as we've said many times we've said it over and over Goliath was in good shape as long as there was no David to answer Goliath could have stood there for years are you with me he can stand there for years in your life - in your life he can stand there in war with you for decades feeling comfortable to sit in a Pew and refuse it to move on let me just say that's a stagnant place to me and when you come to a spot of comfort of reality then I'm just I'm just said safe here leave me alone where I'm at I'm gonna be all right I need more of God today then I had yesterday there's a desire you know we have more Andrew Andrew actually I blended two things together Andrew wrote something the other day and then brother Tim Pruitt I send it to him and he put some lines in it brother brother Andrew I want to just share this with you courage be strong and of a good courage we're believers we're God's sons we fight we don't back up nor do we back down we thought he sheltered us shelters us under his wings he fights our battles he wins our wars we cast Satan out by Holy Ghost boldness he has authorized us and empowered us to use the name of Jesus for any Meade at any time and we believe taking him out of his word by authority casting him out reminding him of who we are we have been declared an invincible army never to be defeated it will be he again that wins this battle for the random watch team as a healer now we watch him as a warrior l Cabal if any bride is prepared if any people is prepared we all I don't care what we face yes it may hurt it may stink and there are future things that we don't know but let us say this if God be for us if God be for us who can be against us there are moments that we come to in our lives till I'd like to just take a couple of moments before I go for and I won't be real long tonight but I said as we look in the scriptures there were showdowns Abraham and lot had a so damn it defined the future of these two men's lives light did not realize he'd lose his family and where he was headed was destruction and he was tilting his family towards destruction to walk away from Christ it's the make a decision that destruction is in my future you say brother honor I can home myself you can't hold yourself I can stay pure and I can stay wholly without Jesus all of us are lost and dying on a when I rode going to hell Goliath is not going to be the first enemy to boast there's a man named Pharoah that made a boast and he crossed the line he came to alive and the judgments of God began to fall on him and he didn't realize there was a point to where he could have accepted the message of the hour and let the children of this will go and his nation still maintained the greatest nation that ever was on the earth but because he contested the messenger of the hour and refuted the message Flass fleas frogs locusts water turned to blood fresh sun find it incredible that God hardens his heart to turn against Moses but another showdown comes Moses is standing at the Red Sea two million people looks like they're going to come into a time to where that that where they're going to be destroyed in moments you're talking about laying it on the line you remember it comes with cost a lot of people are willing to do a lot of things as long as there's no cost especially when it becomes personal it's long it's everybody else doing the cost it's a free ride free riders are not just standing at stop signs with a sign in their hand I'm not throwing a stone at them but since I'm preaching to the whole world now on the internet I can say it more freely a lot of free riders sit in church under the umbrella of the church they get prayers they can fill a part of the community of the church they can sit in a Pew conform a little bit and act the part and it's got benefits to it let me just say that it's got benefits but that's not really laying it on the line ministers were assembled as they were assembled to have a breakfast there was some farm animals having a conversation one was a big in one was a chicken and the chicken was making a great boast that as he looked into she looked into the to the to the table she saw some of the fruit of her labor and she said look what I did for the kingdom of God the pig said that's white admire Belov you too to share your fruit but when they asked me for the ham that's on the table it's total commitment I'm not looking for your dollar in the offering plate I'm not a money guy I'm looking for your heart [Applause] when we come to this spot many people wrassle with a Pew when it comes all to cold times they were a so with that Pew standing in front of them knowing that they need to go forward knowing that they need to step will on with God knowing that they need to make the mess next step but the cost is the issue that goes with it now let me just say what separates the believer or the overcomer from others it's kind of like the Olympics everybody enjoys the guy that climbs up there and gets that gold around his neck and people say well I'd like to be like that and maybe image themselves as being like that but the difference between that guy and the god that sitting in this fan in the stands is the cost and it's been years of dedication and years of work oh brother on but I want to be in the bride of Jesus Christ it will take election of God it will take dedication it will take commitment you won't accidentally bill go to heaven there's rap that's gotta be done first of all you must give yourself to the world I find it's incredible great men can give speeches give group great will to quotations move audiences with influence inspired by inspirational speaking but it don't live on Monday morning computers and and and queries and Bible study programs message study programs has produced a lot of men with zeidel without a collar it's produced men that thought they were preachers and at the end of the day they were good Sunday school guys a lot of people can preach theory and theologians and doctors i'ma preach to you but it takes a Holy Ghost field ministry to challenge us I say this to you somebody's going to meet the challenge of this hour somebody is going to meet the challenge of this hour Romans chapter 8 in verse 28 says this we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to them who were who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow so he knows your history he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among men that many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified which is as when God knows how to wash you with the blood of Jesus Christ to where you're no longer that old man anymore may look like the same house that used to live but God lives on the inside of you so much tell you're no longer the prostitute that drug addict you're no longer that man whom he called them he also justified I like it God justifies it's not man justifying justification is as though you never did it in the flesh first place and whom he justified them he also glorified what should we then say to these things if black before us who can be against us and he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall we he not with him freely give us all things everything that God owns it's given to a believer who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies who is he that condemneth it is Christ that not they rather that is risen again who is at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us and upon his intercession we make confession that by His stripes we are healed [Applause] who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation pur sermons could be preached or hear or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long and we're accounted as a sheep for slaughter they and all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that left us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor Angels nor principalities or powers or things for us are the things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord this was not written from a posh office this was written from a dungeon with a guard with chains wrapped to one another well he wasn't me so we must look beyond their circumstances Andrew said this last night and that this is my favorite scripture if you come here 10 years or 20 years you're going to hear it rectally no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that thou shalt rise against thee and the judgment thou shall condemn whether on but your your preached and condemns me your life condemns me and I come against it let me just say at the judgment this voice this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord and their righteousness as if of the Lord Philippians chapter 1 in verse 6 being confident of this very thing stay with me that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ whether this is your first time or your thousandth and forty times second time you say we're brother on I don't know if God's pulling me what got you here it sure wasn't the devil that got you here so if God is calling out to your life he that started a good work that's the kind of God that don't start and quit that's not pulling days this and going he loves me he loves me not he loves me he loves me not you understand what I'm saying here sister he loves me he loves me not he loves me he loves me not told me he loved me [Applause] God told me he'd fight for me there's not a circumstance or a situation that will break that code with God Philippians 4 verse 13 I can do all things through Christ Jesus through Christ which strengthens me 1st Peter chapter 4 and verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to come to you as though some strange things happen unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad with exceedingly joy ephesians and 6 in verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armour of God that you may able to be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood and against principalities and against powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand we stand in that evil day and having done all to stand what keeps us is his word because there will come times in your own energy you quit there'll be times that where you go I'm never going back I'm tired I'm done I'm done I'm done I quit but let me just remind you you're not holding yourself it ain't you that's holding on it is God that gives you the oxygen in your lungs I know it's me it is God that gives us a strength to get out of bed in the morning are you with me it is God that directs the storms around your lives and your homes and whether or not you know this is angels dispatched around your home your children your nots I don't know what media you that you have whatever news media that you have and you see murder and you see this and rape and all these different kinds of things and drugs and all that different kind of things and it tells the address it tells the names of those people rejoice your name's not on that news that could have been you you go to Walmart there's an angel with you you work on job your job there's an angel with you when you're in your school there's an angel with you come on church your four-year little old baby going to school you dispatched an angel of God to go with you that's better than having an army but human beings with you I'm interested in different things so when I was looking at that scripture the other day I thought I wonder what people pay for for personal security so one of the Kardashians don't be angels you know who they are one of the conditions pays four hundred thousand dollars a month for protection that's most more a month and most of us make here in this church understand what I'm saying here I want to say this to you I'm better protected than she is I've got news for you you're better protected than she is she wants to get snapshots that's how she makes her money but you see if she really was a Christian she cover that baby up Muhammad Ali said cover up your treasures [Applause] why spend eternity on something extremely - a very temporary kings and potentates and greatly and fall for five minutes of pleasure default the devil made me do it nanana nanana nanana nanana he presented the bank you could have told him to go back to where he came from a lot of people don't mind sitting in the pew but when they go home they can't overcome cost you gotta use your tongue and your porn ur finger and tell the devil go back you picked on the wrong half the wrong home the wrong life my penitent you to you come on that's the truth just because it becomes a pop up on your screen don't mean you got to go to it who's available in Elkton don't interest me none whatsoever come on help me pricks now who's between 40 50 60 70 years old who's available in your neighborhood yes God gave me one queen she can't hear me [Applause] you got to decide do I love that woman through all eternity or not and if not don't put a ring on her finger brother on my back in the track or you put yourself in a track but the venom centers say that god it's got a womb around the womb of the Holy Ghost around you so the devil can't get to you you've gotta walk out of that room for the devil to get to you so the blame is on but you don't have to stay that way you don't have to stay that way you don't have to stay that way I would say quit should never be in a Christians language well thou you should have stood up right there quit should never be in your language quit doing pot that's right quit doing push-ups tomorrow morning that's one day we're walking on your treadmill of Armond that's another thing quit eating Krispy Kreme Doughnuts is another thing but the men said I prayed that lord if it's your will for me to get a doughnut today would you provide a parking place for me and on the third time around Krispy Kreme there came a place open [Applause] I finally found them tonight I found exactly where they got y'all been Krispy Kreme Oh interesting we're preaching on laying it all on the line here whether on I need a miracle it's interesting that there are no miracles without a mess first first of all your salvation you were a mess there are no goody two-shoes that walks into the kingdom of God ah that sinned and come short of the glory of God whether or not from a certain family could care less about certain family found Church God is no respecter of persons it doesn't make any difference if your name is Brigham Peter James or John you have a history of being a stinker and without Jesus you still off [Applause] we all rejoice about Sarah having a baby and turning young again in the scriptures and a king lusting after her she became one of the most beautiful women in all of Israel history but she suffered 90 years of humiliating woundedness I believe in that she wasn't good enough help me preach now if you can ever come to a spot to where you realize who you are and how important you are and the kingdom of God you treat yourself different you remember this that God did not just visit Abraham alone but he came to Sarah as well [Applause] sometimes when we get older come to a spot to where that we think about our age deteriorating our minds deteriorating our sight deteriorating our muscles deteriorating it's all part of the human anatomy of Adams Falls but one of the greatest men was Isaac and he came to a spot in his life to word that he couldn't lead himself across the room because he became blind and God had a purpose in that because he had two sons from their womb God chose Jacob and hated Esau you see you couldn't choose yourself God chose you but if you two looked at the true picture of humanity you were to pick diesel he was a better boy he was a religious man he did more things for his mom his daddy he'll he was he had great respect to honor to his father but he did not honor the birthright his brother was a rascal there's a lot of things that we can lay on Jacob there was a lot of things but God loved Jacob and to get Jacob the blessing Isaac had to walk around and blindness a whole lot no miracles without a mess a widow and her son had to starve they had to starve and come to the point of death to where there was only what we might say a half a mil left and she was going to give it to her son and then they were going to commit to die oh the whole nation was done it wasn't just her 9 the whole nation was done but there was a prophet that was coming with unlimited power but before she could have a meal barrel that would never run dry and a cruse of all that would never run ground she had to come to the point of starvation and then she had to be willing to pay the cost baking a cake the moon shares this with us he said now the Hebrew children who were going through their trial he said that was right up at the last moment and they was just ready to step into the furnace you know what sometimes we watch things going on here on earth but there's something going on in heaven all that the same time are you with man there's something going on in heaven at the same time do you mean while it's going on here on earth God's making provision oh you will make this more real for you in just a few minutes sometimes we watch things going on here but there's something going on in heaven the same time we may not be able to see it but it's going on anyhow pardon me let's turn our camera towards heaven now I can see Jesus said it on the throne coming daylight smokes raising up in the skies from the furnace and I see him sitting there watching down and what are they going to do that's what he does when you and I get tried the promise he made hiss he promised that the seed of Abraham would possess the gate of the enemy I believe that I see him watching and all at once the great angel comes to his right side and stands to his attention and puts his hand on his sword and said he said Gabriel he said father have you looked down there there's the seed of Abraham they believe in you they have prayed all night they're going right into their death let me go down there and I'll change the scene I believe that he could have got it done that's right Gabriel you're a good angel now you just stand there here comes another one his name is wormwood he sea angel over all the waters and I can see him stand at attention he said father have you looked down what's going on in Babylon he said yes I've watched him all night long his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me I've watched them all night long they're fixing to burn those three men down there in the morning they're seeds of Abraham that took you by your word they're standing gallon do you know one time you told me to loose the waters and I have control you let me go down there and I'll wash babblin off of the map he could have done it and I can hear him say that's right one word you wonderful angel you did just exactly everything that I told you since you were created I created you but you know I'm going down there myself this is my job and when they were getting ready to take their last step I could see him stand up with his priestly robes drop around him and he's sitting tonight they're bloody making intercession upon our confession for he died that bring to pass anything that we ask where our faith is in him there he stands in motions this way and here comes this big white cloud coming by and he steps on it and he calls the east and the north and the south and the west wind to drive them like horses and crack it across the skies like a cigs AG wagon before they could ever step in there he was standing there because of Adams fall where he crossed the line God made a way of escape the call Senatus fall a man is born a woman in few days in full of troubles oh brother on but I'll become a Christian and everything will go good you gotta fight to have a good marriage you gotta fight every day of your life to overcome God provided you the armor and the word with infinite power but don't take your focus off of Jesus cross [Music] where does God meet us in a trial none of us likes to go there but God makes a way of escape before we ever get there Jesus never cried when they brought the maniac bow to him they had epilepsy failing falling into fire he never said father I'm your son and now you sent me here to do so and so can I heal this boy he never said that he simply said come out of him Satan and he spoke and the boy was well when he met Legion with two thousand Devils in him it wasn't Jesus a crime it was the devils that were crying suffer us to go under that hurt us Wan God knows who's the most powerful so why does he tempt you he's wanting to get your power what do you have that he don't have now let's just think about it for a moment what do you have that he don't have he owns the kingdoms of the world Whitney what do you have that he don't have how old are you Whitney 20 you're 20 years old this is a devil of a war with you you ever battle in your mind you have a do you on a house so we don't want that do you own the mercedes-benz you own your car that's nice you have a million-dollar ring so those are things that see he's got Marilyn Monroe he's got Hollywood he's got kings and governors and potentates he's got all the advertisers so why would he be fighting you you must possess something that is a hidden power that he don't have [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] why does he fight me so much cause I'm something that is eternal life that's got power over every devil inhale oh gods give it to me so why didn't why does he continue to fight brother branham though he's been dead over fifty years let's just not just brother branham why does he fight Jesus and they say he never existed when he knows that Jesus showed up in his house he now said Jesus came into his place and took the keys of death hell and the grave and he knows that he don't even know that they even the stranger of death he knows that he knows he knows oh yeah [Applause] but the random winning priest to seven seals after he met an angel of the Lord you can fuss and fight over that but the seven seals were revealed and the thunders were revealed and Satan is fighting us because we got him it's ash we believe it we don't have to fight over it no more it's ours the mystery is revealed it's inside of us now it's a book of life were the people of the open book it's ours we are possessors of it and so therefore Satan knows that the last attack against the bride of Jesus Christ the brother branham would come down to certain spots and he would say certain things and knowing that he's standing in two different worlds at the same time but not only was God there but the enemy was there and was a great contest and sometimes as as a prophet he had to lay it all on the line he could lay it all on the line because Jesus was living in him and he had laid it all on the line because Jesus was in the garden and he said father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thy will be done he would turn to his disciples said let not your heart be troubled now speaking into world's that not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions he was not talking about brick and mortar and stone he was talking about you got a new body waiting over there for you and Paul would say behold I show you a mystery flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God John the Revelator be certainly safe but behold and of God are you with me the the tabernacle of God were you and I will dwell together behold I see a new heaven and a new earth for the first Earth and the first heaven there passed away come to some certain points to where that little Finland boy was laying there two years the vision was it was laying there and his bones were out of he's actually tore through his clothes and brother man recognized the recognized him don't know it but after a bit he begins to realize this is the vision am I gonna go into great details but brother Brown said he walks up there and he said if this little boy is not on the ground off of the ground in five minutes you call me a false prophet you talking about laying it all on the line every sermon ever discernment every overcoming everything you're laying it all on the line if he's not off of the ground in five minutes you call me a false prophet but the member steps out behind the pulpit one night and he says if I'm not telling you the truth may God strike me dead just after that he calls out 14 different people in one place one person he told them 22 different things about them not another preacher brother Brown wasn't a prophet then simply bring me somebody that was I'm a good student you want to throw rocks bring me the right man if he's not either that or you brought yourself to a line you brought yourself to a line and you crossed a line you didn't have to cross the line unbeliev and walk away but favorite brought himself to a line and he condemned is how nation even on real life they condemn the whole family their children and the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren it ain't just you there were some things presented to you last night somebody wasn't here I will close this and I'm going to be I'm just gonna testify to you for just a few more minutes so all this is free last night Andrew brought you some news for those that weren't here last night we've been presented with some news God has brought me through and before I go there before we even get Galatz some credit if Haman and Pharoah wanted to make a contest and goliath wanted to walk in the field and him against to make his boast that first of all we need to draw some lines let's just draw some lines here I want to remind God I want to remind Goliath I want to remind the devil whose side I'm on if we gotta fight this battle I wanna kill him whose side I'm on and I want to remind him that they told me I'd never walk again after falling 40 feet and landing on concrete and ever vertebra was both broken but God raised me back up that not [Applause] strokes heart issues blood pressure since it was eighteen-years-old burning in the fire so let's just bring that up just for a moment you see it was on the day that the doctors gave me up and I was laying in a coma that God dealt with brother Bisco you're from brother bisko's and I told them last week what you there or not there why wouldn't you be there I came to your place but you can't be here and there at the same time as well you're here and I've been accused of being a brother fiscal supporter well I don't I'm not ashamed of that what or so ever so I'm just gonna give you why where I stand at Bisco who had been a mentor he had been an example whom I preached convention after convention with and more than I can even remember I've stood in the pulpits with him and watched him preach and heard the stories all being exactly right when I was in that coma on that day God speaks to him early in the morning to call sister Connie who was sitting on a platform tonight and you can stand and God speaks to brother best go to call sister Connie and he begins to talk to her and he and he begins to talk to her about the situation and he says it is the last thing to go with the hearing so I want you to whisper and the runs years that we have blocked Mount Baker Bible Way camp and God has spoke to me that he will be the speaker at camp next year did it happen sister Katie would you stand that's the first time that she ever screamed in a church and she was screaming in the audience and brother Tom Bray said does she do that every service I said never heard him do that before brother Andrew will you stand and Andrew was a good boy and he was my son but he needed the Holy Ghost and standing in Victoria God gave him on the street the baptism of the Holy Ghost he came home a different person [Applause] I'm saying this in the great big scope of things God don't just have me on his mind in a time like this those moments are a critical importance sowho acid that told air disco to call me why you left me who was it I told this story at Ray Erickson's until this very story at Ray artisans and a preacher who made a video against the message contested me after the service and put his nose right here listen it's a bad thing to put your nose that close to me Matthew calls me a honey badger brother Nathaniel you know 100% sure I'll fight for you I am made of fighting material when I got finished he wanted to leave the room he wanted to leave the room swiftly I said just a moment just a moment just in case this video gets to him he knows this is the truth cuz it'll get to him it'll get to him but he knows like the devil knows I said just a minute you be a man you walked into this office uninvited you took me on night I took you off you took me on now we're gonna walk out of this office walk through those doors you was with us walk through those doors walk through one doors then through another door there's gonna be about six or seven preachers standing there and a photographer is gonna take our pictures he said how do you know how do you know the same voice that give me the sermon today told me that's what's going to happen and we walk through the door and we walk through the other door and there they all stand and he looked at me I said now you be a man and stand here beside a man sometimes you got to lay it all on the line this message is right it's not negotiable you'd be seated behind oh Carlos you're here tonight this will only means something to you but it was working at your place at another facility you wasn't there and that Matthew looked at me and said what's wrong dad I said I can't tell you right now and he kept going what's wrong dad there's already what's wrong and I said he's here and whenever he comes he's here to do a job gains of the Lord came into that trouble they're gonna talk to him you see he's concerned about your everyday part of life so I when we get done we have lunch with Connie at Cracker Barrel and Andrew sends me and I speak to a special man that no and he had a real big burden and he had a real big situation and he looked at me and he said I need help and I said interesting God came by and gave me the answer are you willing to hear it and I said you need to get rid of this person and you need get rid of that person you need to get rid of this person you need to get rid of that person because they're trying to destroy your company and Carlos I told him to keep you ain't saying this for the good of any human being here tonight but God watches over our footsteps are you with me here's a man on the brink of bankruptcy and when you got God on your side you can't lose I learned it brother Tim heard that I was going to come to this point so I'm coming to it now you see when God prepares a battle he starts getting ready but the temperate came here 12 years ago while I was laying in the coma on the days to where that they took me off of the ventilator and then I was brain dead for 36 hours or non-responsive let me put it right non-responsive sister Connie's still thinks I'm brain dead at times and brother temperate preaches to you words of prophecy one words one sermon was God will have a testimony now it's easy to look back 12 years ago well that's easy sermon for him to preach because God had a testimony but when you're standing in the fire and God speaking to you and your best buddy is in the is give up and you walk to an audience that shell-shocked and you tell that audience what God's told you to preach to them God will have a testimony Hemi was here that night well if God's ever been with you he'll never leave you brother Tim brewer was in Israel on a trip because of Isaac was more than fulfilling a vision and he walked down in a brook to where David picked up stones and when he reached down he picked up five stones for himself and five stones for me five smooth stones then our great big stones but you don't need a great big stone don't get done before I get no mother Kelly Hildebrandt was standing here and you witnessed because when I preach for him he had a coin laying on his desk and it was a coin to where you could only get one of them as a citizen you could only get one and I liked that car I'm beyond the way I like that going I looked at it I looked at it I taught it I thought about because that coin is Normandy and Canadians had committed troops it came at great cost they lost more men than any other nation did at that matter some of us lost family members in that battle give me a name max max said here for many years he was a ruffler he was a rough codger he came to the Lord and he lost his mind but he came to a spot one time he was coming up here and setting on platform he tell me said brother Ron I love you I preached on predestination how God watched over your life even when you wasn't in control and when you went in a Christian even when you were at war he was watching over you and he said when I ran the beach at Normandy he said I jumped off the boat and I was still alive I got in that bloody water and I was still alive I ran all the way the beach and I was still arrived I ran all the way to the wall and I was still allowed and he said not until I said in this church till I realized why I was still alive [Music] this is a war coin it's got a piece of sand from Normandy on it and it's got to say it that I say right to nut we that will accept nothing less than victory [Applause] but the Jeff and sister Hannah brought me a picture with Jesus in the storm well the TJ walked into my house yesterday and handed me this he said I made it special for you because he didn't know the battle that I was in and God was reminding me one more time this is how my healings coming I don't know how many hours it took you to make it but I got it sitting
