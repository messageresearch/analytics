Pennsylvania here uh we kind of live in Amish Country uh midnight country back over in Dayton and um this morning I was kind of watching the horses come up we passed about 20 to 30 buggies and in my heart I was looking at them uh horses as they was running up the hills and and you seen them sweating and you seen them kind of gasping for a and I I kind of in my heart kind of got a little bit you might want to say uh not mad at them but just little take it easy on them horses so normally we read the Bible uh in the mornings uh but this morning we listen to a tape and then was coming to church and we read the Bible and we was reading Pro Proverbs and it said and this was for me it said a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast and it kind of humbled me down a little bit say Lord you know even my very thoughts and that's what the word of God does it discerns your thoughts heart so if you're here this morning out on the internet this is a resurrection if you ain't got the Holy Ghost where it's time to get it Church we're leaving so let's just pray and believe together our gracious father as we just come to you Lord and father as we just heard the message this morning is the rising of the Sun and father how how great you are Lord just to be resurrected in a believer's heart father we can see that this world ain't got much longer to be here and father the little brides

longing to see that time and father to see our loved ones to see the the ones that pass the veil the curtain of time and and Lord I'm just praying father this morning Lord if there's one here that

here in living in our hearts filling our lives touching us happy Easter happy Easter oh what a what a time what a time it is to be living in the hour that we are living in right now to see to see what the physical manifestation of the Holy Ghost is doing right here amongst us and and we're just bringing good reports and I'm sure more to come from the camp there in Louisiana and I know I know that you parents that sent your kids off and I know that you're going to be bringing back some different kids and it's very very powerful just hearing how the Lord worked amongst uh I know um just two or three that I know from our group um testifying they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost last night so every energy every everything that we've put into these camps has been worth it for one but to bring back a test testimony that you're bringing kids back differently than the camp is a great success and to that we're grateful uh we want to be remembering our pastor brother Ron is as he's uh I'm sure he's very wore out today and and uh so we just want to be remembering him remember our families are traveling back home from from Louisiana being in the camps there and they got a big journey in front of them but the good thing they got a lot of testimonies to share all the way and I'm sure it'll take all 17 hours of them to share it all so we're just uh very very thankful for all those things and uh happy to have uh the king family uh from Farmville is that correct no pens of this all right all right I'm getting this straightened and from Farmville okay all right so and uh from what I understand they're they're not Ken they're just friends so but we're happy to have we're happy to have you here with us and just want to say God richly bless you and hope you feel feel at home here amen and uh maybe you could just see me after service today and i' like to shake your hands and amen isn't he wonderful to us and uh I know that brother Matthew made an announcement about the uh for the little for the bags uh for the goodies the church is handing those out sister Anna sister Carly's going to hand those out that ain't us that ain't for us adults that's for them 11 and under so so uh so you just if you you got a child it's 11 under just make sure you see sister Hannah sister Carly there after the service and make sure that they take it outside if you don't mind and uh we appreciate appreciate you being reverent uh during this time of our uh construction here and and uh so we just appreciate you uh just bearing with us in all of that and it'll all come together and uh in his timing but the Lord keeps adding Lord keeps adding we might have to uh just tear the whole thing down and so start all over from scratch so God's got an idea of what he's doing with us and it ain't just it ain't just in the natural but it's it's in the spiritual and he's building us up and I tell you I I'm just so excited so excited to be living right here right now in the hour one of these mornings it ain't just going to be us talking about Jesus getting up from the grave but we're going to watch our physical loved ones raise up and manifest right in front of our eyes it's Easter we should expect these things it's in the atmosphere we're in a moment we ought to praise the Lord for it all amen amen how many has a need today that you'd like to make known unto the Lord amen I know we've asked you that hundreds and thousands of time setting here but today I believe that every single one of your needs even though he could have met him this past week from last week and you raising your hand but right now we're needy people but I believe that the god of the Resurrection is here in the room uh he's here in the room and I believe with all of my heart he's able to reach into that realm and touch your life maybe brother to a brother sister to a sister we just bind our faith together amen let's just let's just lay our hands hands upon one another because there are special Miracles that are done when a body begins to unify together father we approach you father today in the most humble way that we know how father Lord what a resurrection that this is to see father that the Sun is up to recognize what you've brought us from what you've called us from and we want to express with everything that is within us thank you for this Easter morning thank you for the resurrection oh God and I pray father today that you would just come and flood this atmosphere and you would just fill this place with your presence Lord the atmosphere the songs of Zion have been sing but Lord we are asking father that you'd come in word father you'd come in deed and that you'd come in Liberty and you'd come father and you'd minister to us Lord through the preaching of the word for that is where us as your children We Gather our strength from and I pray father that you'd meet these needs that have been lifted up to you father by the way of an uplifted hand father there are needs there are situations there are questions that need to be answered there are things father that only only you can answer and I pray father that you'd come today now father we see the physical proof that you are alive that it's not just something that we've heard about but you're right here in the room you've gathered with us Lord to speak to us and the Bible said that where the Eagles are gathered the carcass is there father so we recognize that the carcass is here the [Music] in uh in the Book of Matthew chapter 27 verse 52 Matthew chapter 27 and verse 52 amen Matthew chapter 27 and verse 52 and then we'll turn down to Matthew chapter 28 and the Bible said and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came up out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many Matthew chapter 28 and verse one and in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the SRE and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it and his countenance was like lightning and his rainment was white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead man I think it's amazing that we recognize that this was not just a n ordinary man that came but this was a Angelic messenger that came from heaven and what we see that brother Brandon would talk to us and he would tell tell us that that there we watch he said there that morning star came all the way from glory and it was shining as it came down there and he come rolling down through there and he said he said he come down through there and he said with just the brush of his hand he rolled the stone back he rolled the stone back it was proof when you read the Scripture it was proof of what was happening on the inside because of the Angelic Messenger on the outside and for fear of him did the keepers did shake and became his dead man I I think it's amazing that here we recognize that these are some of the greatest Centurion soldiers that there is these are men that have been known to be Mighty Men of of fighting of Warriors these men and notice that at the very sight of that angel they begin to get scared and run away and I think it's amazing when we recognize that Resurrection it Resurrection can bring fear it can bring fear to a sinner but it brings consolation to a real believer and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He Is Risen as he has said come and see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell his disciples that he's risen from the dead behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you and they departed quickly from the SRE with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples words also 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse 14 let's go to verse 13 here Paul says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not as even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that which are alive and remain under the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of an archangel and with the Trump of God and brother brandham said in a Rapture Rapture message he said God does all three of those things at one time while he's descending and the and the dead in Christ shall rise for first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words may God bless his word you may be seated here in the presence of the Lord today I'd like to take a thought to speak to you on today on the dawning of a new day the dawning of a newe day and there is no Gra that can hold this body down because we recognize that here we are watching one of the greatest events that we've ever seen throughout the throughout the course of humanity because all the way back in the Garden of Eden there we watch the very fall of humanity where God speaks to Adam and Eve and tells them that you're able to eat of every tree of of of the garden but that of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil don't touch it for thou Willl surely die and ever since then ever since then death has been raining had been raining upon the Earth for 6,000 years it had rained upon the Earth or 4,000 years it had rained upon the Earth and there were mighty men that came there was men like Abraham that came and he died there was there that we just spoke of Adam he died even though he would live way up into his late late years of his life but even he would die even Methuselah that he would he would come to be one of the most oldest men that is that is recorded in the Bible but none of them were able to reach the age of a thousand years old because that is a sign that that is a it is for a millennial Reign type of people that have went beyond death but even in throughout all the ages there were men that would rise men of Great Men of Great Men that would rise and they would die but there was something that was always that was lingering upon humanity is there a way out of death even John the Baptist he was there was the Bible said that there was none greater than John the Baptist and the Bible said that that Jesus said that he was more than a prophet because he was not just a prophet but he was a prophetic messenger under the age that he was going to but Jesus was not just a prophet Jesus was not just one of the boys Jesus was not just a good man Jesus wasn't a man that just went about Healing The Sick and he wasn't that kind of a man but this was almighty God that was dealing or dwelling in human humanity and dwelling in human flesh and to think that there was a man that could live on Earth in humanity like you and I are living in and the Bible recorded that never a man spake like this there was everybody that anybody that had the power to be able to speak to the winds and the winds would cease there was never anybody that could that could do the things that he was doing it was because the indwelling of the Holy Spirit was was from the very Throne of God it was it was God himself living on the inside of Jesus Christ's body Hallelujah and to think that when Jesus is standing there in Revelations 1:7 that John said that when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last and I am he that liveth and was dead let's say that together and was dead and behold I am alive happy Easter happy Easter behold I am alive forever more and have the keys of hell and of death when Jesus rose up on Easter morning he had something in his hand that had been locked away since Adam death had locked man in a cave death had locked him into a place that he couldn't get himself out of but when Jesus rose up on Easter morning he had the key to it he had the key to it and the only way that you're going to ever escape get out the door is to go by the one that's got the key to it because man had always feared death because they had not an assurance of ever coming back again after they died but job asked this question one time when he was speaking to the Lord he said if a man die shall he live again is that righty that's a very good question to ask if a man man die shall he live again job was looking at nature and he'd seen the flower how that it would die in the wintertime how it would go to the how that he would go to its grave but then in springtime he would raise back up again so job had a question he had a question about it if a man die shall he live again because job was looking at something job was catching a vision of something that man needed an escape out of death job knew something that he needed a redeemer all the prophets spoke about this Redeemer David said in Psalms 49 and 15 that my God but God will redeem my soul from the power of the Grave that he shall receive me sh so there is something that is that was constantly that was weighing on the thoughts of God's children is there power from the grave is there power from the grave youve bu a lot of you've buried a lot of your your young people you've buried a lot of your loved ones you buried a lot of family members but we don't we don't just rest assure we don't just rest assure in the box that we put them in because the box that we put them in in in just a few days they will never look the same as what they were here but there is something that has the power to get them out of that grave and job was wondering about this can a man if he die can he live again and one day when job was out there and he was talking with God he done went through some trials he done went through some Saturdays and he' come to a spot where he was considering all of these things and all of a sudden brother brandom said that he caught a resurrection he caught a resurrection Vision he caught the inspiration he said for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the later day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God now think about this Easter proved that job's Revelation was right that the prison house that men wanted to get out of the Grave that concealed them that Easter was the way out of it let me say it like this Easter settled Easter settled all the questions that there was a man who said I have power to lay my life down and I got power to raise it up again this Easter proved that what job saw was a physical manifestation of what the Revelation Hallelujah of what he caught now think about this job is the very first book in the Bible you don't see it till it gets into the until you get into the Psalms until you get into the Poetry part of the Bible but job is the very first book of the Bible that's been written and job is grabbing a revelation before Moses ever writes down what Adam has seen job is catching this Revelation I think it's a very powerful thing to to identify yourself with the power of Revelation because job had caught a hold of something that was going to link all of the prophets together they was going to testify about it but job was going to say I know he's not just the god of the dead but he's the god of the living I'll tell you how powerful job's Revelation was is that Abraham caught that Revelation and said I'll tell you what he said if job's got that kind of Revelation I'm not going to bury my wife down here in any other place he said I've got to bury her over in mpela where job said that there's going to come a resurrection so what did Abraham do Abraham do have this re ation yet but he has Hallelujah but what did he do he tied himself together by the revelation of what job had seen that there was a redeemer that was coming when Abraham goes to buy the piece of property that his sweetheart Sarah as she's just passed Beyond passed beyond the realm of Tears he goes to buy this this land of mcpa and the men that own that property said no no Abraham we're going to give it to you because you're a righteous man and Abraham so said no I'm going to buy this piece of property I want to pay for this piece of property and they they argued with him they tried to bicker with him they tried to give him a deal but Abraham said no I'm going to buy this piece of property because you see what it was a sign of it was the same thing that when Jesus was up there in Matthew chapter 4 when Satan was trying to offer him a kingdom without going to the calvary of going and pay the price it was a sign of Abraham having to pay the price for the gray out of the Grave that's the same way he'll do you that's the same way that Satan will do you he will offer you religion without the baptism of the Holy Ghost come on somebody he'll offer you easy believism without fully surrendering your life over ah come on somebody it's Easter morning but it goes down in history that Abraham when he purchases this piece of ground it's the most expensive piece of ground that has ever been purchased throughout Humanity that Abraham buys this piece of property do you recognize that on Friday on Good Friday that when Jesus was up there dying on the cross he was making the greatest purchase that there ever had been he wasn't just doing that he wasn't just doing that for for himself he was doing that to purchase the greatest piece of property that could ever be purchased I hope you recognize who I'm talking about today I'm talking about a people that have the power to recognize that if job had a revelation how much more should you have a revelation that you don't have to go by the way of the Grave you don't have to go through trials you don't have to go through situations without recognizing there is a Redeemer there is a power there is an anointing there is a life come on somebody without this message there is no life but Jacob and Joseph tap thems into that Revelation when Jacob was down there in Egypt and he'd been that he'd been touched by the angel and he told Joseph said lay your hands right here on the inner part of my thigh Lay Your Hands there where the angel touched me and never walk the same again Joseph I want you to swear to me that you won't leave my bones laying down here in Egypt what was he saying to Joseph he said there is no power down here to get me out of the grave in Egypt but take my bones and bury them in Palestine every day of their life when the Israelites were in slavery when they were walking by that where and they were walking past that coffin they could look over there and they could catch a vision maybe they had been beat that day maybe they had been mocked that day maybe they' been criticized that day but they could catch a vision that there is somebody that testified there's somebody that testified that there's coming a resurrection what are you talking about brother Andrew I'm talking about when you get in your worst moments take a look and capture vision of the cross that identifies you don't have to go by the way of the Grave you don't have to go down in trials there's somebody that paid for you to go in a Rapture what am I saying to you I'm saying There Ain't No Grave There Ain't No Grave that could hold this body down because on Resurrection morning this ain't this is more than a song this is more than a song when Claud Eli from the hills of Virginia when he wrote that song he had been he had been struck down with tuberculosis and he was in a spot of death and his family had been gathered around him said prepare for death prepare prepare it your your loved ones getting ready to die but they begin to pray the prayer of faith over the Evangelist Claude Eli and he come up out of that moment and he started writing down this song There Ain't No Grave going to hold this body down well early in the morning about the break of day and an angel came from heaven and he rolled the stone away now if a sick man can rise up out of that condition and he could write that kind of a song what about your testimony this morning you're not sick but you know and you caught a revelation you've c a revelation that there is a power that can take you out of the Grave there's an anointing that's why that's why Joseph would say well don't leave my bones down here they were carrying when they were coming out of Egypt they were carrying his bones what were they doing when they were without Vision they could lay a hold of somebody that already had a vision and when you are in despair you can look over and tap in that there was a prophet that came in this generation that came in this generation to give you a vision that there is life and there is proof that dry bones can live again dry bones can live again the Bible said for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which also in sleep in Jesus will God bring with him how are you so sure that you're going to make it brother Andrew because Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12: 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized in one body in Jesus Christ's name come on somebody do you know what I'm talking about this morning I'm saying to you don't you bury me like Joseph had don't you bury me down there in Egypt there ain't no life down there don't bury me down there in some Creed don't bury me in some denomination don't bury me in some trinitarian Doctrine bury me bury me where there's life at where there's power at where there's an anointing at I guess I'm going to preach by myself today but don't you dare try to bury me in some water down grave of what people think the message is bury me where the power is I know you can get shook up about what the world's doing but don't you bury me down there in that kind of ideology but bury me bury me where there's life at bury me where there's power at bury me where there's Truth at that's what all them prophets said if job's got that Revelation to be buried there the you bury me there you bury me where job's going to be living at and what was it on Easter when he resurrected from the grave that the graves were open and them that had died in faith did Jesus bring with him now notice what the Bible said in 1 Corinthians 15 and 20 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death By Man Came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die but even so in Christ shall all be made alive shall all be made alive ain't it powerful to know that by Adam came death but by the second Adam came life and life more abundantly and that's what Satan's objective to do is to send you to a premature grave his whole intent and his motive is to send you to a premature grave he'll bury you up with drugs he'll bury you up with alcohol he'll bury you up with all kinds of sin all kinds of troubles all kinds of rejecting Spirits upon you and he's trying to send you to a premature grave but the God of this message knows how to shut the door of the Grave I said you can't have them alcohol you can't have them drugs you can't have them s you can't have them problems you can't hallelujah hallelujah he's greater than drugs you can testify can't you sister Devon he's greater than alcohol I could call your name he's greater than sin I could call your name oh blessed be the name of the Lord he ain't talking about death he's talking about life this message didn't come to bury you up with some kind of Theology and give you a new idea it come to give you a relationship with the power that raises from the dead that's just wait lay some word in here Hosea 13 and 14 said I will Ransom them from the power of the grave and I will redeem them from death oh death I will be thy plues oh grave I will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from my house we all love we all love the story of Hezekiah how that Hezekiah prayed he turned his face to the wall and he began to weep and ask God for more years to be added onto his life but I love I love reading hezekiah's Psalm of Praise in Isaiah 38:18 this is a man that knows what he's talking about he's just been at the point of death where a prophet comes knocks on his door and said prepare for death but because he had the power inside of him to turn his face to the wall and pray notice what verse 18 say for the grave can't Praise You death cannot celebrate you the they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the living the living shall praise thee as I do this day for the father to the children shall make known thy truth Hallelujah for the Lord was ready to save me therefore will we sing my songs Oh to the string instrument all the days of our life in the house of the Lord Hezekiah wasn't singing David's song he was singing hezekiah's song and if you know what it's like to be safe from sin you ain't singing brother Ron's testimony you ain't singing brother Andrew's testimony you ain't singing David's testimony but my songs come on somebody if you're in that spot and you feel like you got more life left in you all you got to do is turn your head to the Lord say God I got more power in Me God I got more life in me I'm not done with my Ministry yet and turn your face to the wall and said God if you send me to the Grave then somebody after there won't be able to praise you no more but if you raise me back up Hallelujah some of you was in Graves of of denominationalism some of you was in Graves of all kinds of all kinds of dirty habits but I want to announce to all of Hell There Ain't No Grave that can hold this body down come on somebody the church World tried to bury you up with their ideas but There Ain't No Grave sin tried to Barry bury you up and cover you up but the deeper you bury the the true seat of God when the sun begins to rise the more beauty that comes forth that's why God has giv you beauty for your [Applause] ashes hallelujah hallelujah I ain't just talking about some natural grave I'm talking about a spiritual grave There Ain't No Grave no pornography habit no suicide Spirit no depression no anxiety no fear I know what I'm talking about brother Justin when grave when the grave was calling your name there was a pastor that stood here and said let's pray for our brothers let's pray for our police officers and because there was somebody that was trying to send you to a premature grave there was a higher power said not today [Applause] Satan Hallelujah then fear has no hope anxiety has no hold the grave what am I saying I'm saying that the grave has no power over this body you can bury Lazarus but when Jesus is coming just get ready come on when Jesus is on your road there ain't a stone that can stand in his way I love this that God the God that was on the inside of that grave on Easter morning had the ability had the ability to blast it completely away did he not did he not because he stood there later in that chapter and said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth I love this I love this and brother Brandon would say he said before the resurrection he could not say that all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me he said but after the resurrection he could stand there and say all power in heaven and in Earth that was showing that an Angelic messenger was coming to roll the very stone of death out of your life what am I saying to you I'm saying that there was an angel that stood in this generation that rode the stone of hell away from you oh blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm 6:5 said for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give you thanks Lord if I go to the Grave I know there's a bunch of people out there that won't Praise You But If You Raise Me Up Lord I'll praise you till there's not any more breath in my lungs the grave can't Praise Him church that's that's why you got to come out of the Grave come on you can't keep you can't be hiding back there you can't hide in the shadows no more because in the grave you can't praise him but when you get on the outside of the Grave you can say go tell my disciples that Jesus still lives I think it's a very powerful thing that we witness that God still lives and God still Reigns right here in this generation when God would raise up a Joe Robinson that should have been gone by the way of the grave but it's a testimony that there is no power in the grave over a seed of God oh brother maram comes in true Easter seal he grabs some thoughts and says he said what is what is Easter mean he said he said I he said he said I know what that Easter seal he said what it means of them people standing out there trying to take up contribution he said I think they're doing a great thing he said but what does Easter mean to us he said I know what they're doing he said they're trying to raise up uh money to make people more comfortable in the in the hospitals of tuberculosis and different things they had their seals up on it he said but what does the Easter seal mean to you and I surely Easter's got to be more than just a seal of making people more comfortable is that right Easter's got to mean something and I believe that Easter meant so much to the Christian church and to our Christian Heritage he said it's the Seal of the Resurrection that's what Easter I know what Easter means to me but what does it mean to you I think it's a good question to ask what does Easter mean to you well let me just tell you what it means to me I don't have to go back to no cold formal dead religion no more I don't have to go back to drugs no more I don't have to go back to a way of living where I didn't know whether I was going to live today or die tomorrow I know what Easter means to me but what does it mean to you for by death for man came by death but by man also so came the resurrection of the life what's Easter mean to you come on now what's Easter mean to you Easter mean to you brother David told me last weekend I hope it's all right and I don't think you mind telling cuz he told me anything that you tell a preacher can be used against you but he told me he told me he said ever since I was 13 years old he said said I drink hard liquor every day of my life he said but after coming here second time coming here he said the complete desire has completely gone away I'll tell you what Easter means to Brother David how about you Sister Mary what's Easter mean to you when a lot of people walked away and it looked like you should have walked away too but God rich in Mercy Easter meant something to you because it wasn't just Easter for Jesus Jesus it was Easter for Mary Hallelujah come on out of it come out of the cold religion come out come out of the ideology come out of formalism you've got enough Liberty in this room right now to resurrect yourself a we going somewhere church but there's enough Liberty right here in this room that will one of these mornings between the hours of 600 and 9 it'll be one of these atmospheres that'll physically change our mortal bodies you all the time talking about atmosphere that's exactly right because it's an atmosphere that'll sweep into the room it's an atmosphere if you build it up in Holy Faith and you build it up with worship one of these days oh blessed be the name of the Lord now notice notice what the Bible said in Leviticus chapter 23 and the n9th chapter to the 11th verse and brother rer picks this up and it is the rising of the sun he said now he said listen close in the law the levitical law of God speaking to Moses said listen all these things are types now he said we stop here for a few minutes to get this type he said and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you come into the land which I give unto you notice what brother random said unto the place under the position that I've given unto you notice brother Ram catches and places it perfect perfectly in position for the bride when you come into the land or when you come into the place the position that I've given unto you he said now you speak to the children of Israel that when you get to this certain place that I promised you I take you when you get there in this land now notice he said speaking to Natural here he said but typen the spiritual and he said and shall reap the Harvest thereof you have received what I told you thereof then you shall bring a sheath of the first fruits of your Harvest under the priest and he shall wave the sheath before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it now notice what he goes on to say he said if there would have been any holy ritual he said it should come forth on the Sabbath day which was the seventh day of the week which is Saturday he said but did you notice in this Memorial it was to wave it on the first day of the week it'll sink in a minute but did you notice in this Memorial it was to wave it before the Lord on the first day of the week the sheath which was the first of your seed that you planted when it comes up and ripened you cut down the sheath and you took it to the priest and let him take it and wave it before the Lord for your exception that you are accepted child could fall in here and hurt himself and we'd hear it but he waved he waved it before the Lord for your exception before the Lord what is happening it's before the Lord for your exception not on the Sabbath day the seventh day but on the first day which is called Sunday what are you trying to say to me I'll make it real clear it ain't Saturday no more the silence is over what are you saying to me brother Andrew quit you crying kid quit you weeping weeping may endure for the night but joy comes in the morning I'm trying to get something to you that it ain't just Saturday no more Hallelujah it ain't a day of rest no more it's Sunday it's Sunday oh blessed be the name of the Lord he said course he said that's a Roman word he said which they called it the Su day Su n the day for the Sun God he said but how it has changed he said it's no more Su n anymore but it's s o n d a y the Sunday that the corn of wheat God's first one up from the dead is to be be waved over the congregation that we are the seed and the first of that seed of those that slept waved upon the first day of the week Hallelujah on Sunday on Sunday he raised up and he waved goodbye and he sended up on high in the presence of the people what am I saying to you that that which was in the natural when the first one come to Resurrection the high priest would wave it before the congregation but when Jesus the corn wheat that fall into the ground if it die it abideth alone but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit what was it it was a memorial day that it was waved out across the crop what was it a sign to all of Israel that there's more coming Satan I got bad news for you it ain't just Jesus that's coming it ain't just Paul that's coming it just ain't arenus that's coming it ain't just Columba that's coming it ain't just Luther that's coming it ain't just Wesley that's coming it ain't just an isus of Pentecost that's coming but this is a restoration of the Bride tree let me say it's more than just William brandham coming it's more more than Ron Spencer coming it's more than Andrew Spencer coming but they're sons of God what are you witnessing weekend after weekend it's the waving of the sheath that is going across the generation the name of the lord it's a sign that if he rose I'll rise with him I'm preaching you the message it's because he was the first Son of God to come to full maturity he was plucked up from the Earth and was waved over the people he said but what this is was it was really the first fruits of them that slept and was waved over the promised seed that had a promise of life in it because if that seed has not been deratization you that he that attracted him to you that's what brother random said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that God loved fatherhood so he became a father because he had sons that was going to raise up what was it it's a sign that he didn't just get up out of the Grave that he didn't just get up and raise up on Easter morning but it's a sign to a generation that if that spirit that ra raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies and brother brandom said there's the catch right there but if but if that Spirit but if that Spirit dwells in you but if that spirit that dwells in you if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken or make alive your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you the spirit that dwells in you is the same spirit that was waved over the congregation brother Bram brother bham comes in and he he ties some things together and I think it's very beautiful the brother bandam goes all the way back in the Old Testament and he begins to tie some things together of his resurrection and our resurrection and he goes in there and he starts talking about the first resurrection and then he starts talking about our Resurrection he said if you look at Elijah and Elisha he said it's like a bird he said they've got he said a bird's got two wings and it's got a balance itself it's got to balance itself he said Elijah was the Translating Wing he said but Elisha was the resurrection Wing well blessed be the name of the Lord he was the Translating Wing but this was a resurrection Wing notice the same power that got Elijah across the Jordan was a same double portion that got Elisha back over and he didn't stand out there and say where is Elijah at now Brad I'm talking to you he didn't come out there and said where's Elijah at he stood out there and said where is the god of Elijah act let me say this to you William brandham ran his part he ran his race but now it's your turn to run this race with every with everything that's within you where is the god of Elijah I'll tell you he ain't in some tomb he ain't in some grave he ain't in Eastern Shore he's in this body oh blessed be the name of the [Applause] Lord give me my double portion I know you're asking a hard thing but let me say this to you that what you're asking of it's a hard thing but it's a righteous thing that what Jesus did you can do also because that quickening power it's not the power of a man it's the power of God what is it it's the abstract of Easter that the resurrected Jesus has sent back the abstract to guarantee us that we are already quickened with him and if they if I Rise they'll rise at that day you should know that I'm in the father and the father me and I in you but do you want to get up out of it I'm going to let a preacher loose here just for a minute do you really want to get up out of your problems or are you enjoying worshiping your situation are you satisfied with a halfway kind of Life I'll say this that he didn't just wave himself over you just to see that you could barely sprig up he waved himself over you to see you fully rise in resurrection power come on somebody because it's not just one thing if it's one thing if Jesus rise but what if he's waved over a congregation and they don't rise up to worship Him Full Gospel Lighthouse you're guilty if you miss the Rapture because you've had every opportunity you've had every chance of the word of God when William would stand there and he said I feel it in the room now when William Brandon would stand there and he said every generation has a fresh chance at the word of God and he has come here time and time again he has manifested his power he's manifested his truth we've handled him we've touched him we've felt him this Hallelujah this ain't a Jesus of 2,000 years ago only but he's right here and he's in the room and if he's in the room I'm going to worship ship him Simon s sirene of the Pharisees he may not worship him but while he's in the room I'm going to make sure that I got my ticket in hand hallu you're guilty for crucifying the word of God again you're guilty when he's waved himself over you hallelujah hallelujah when the word of God has waved over this generation not just in a preacher not just in a prophet but the very physical manifestation of the Holy Ghost has waved itself over this generation Le oosa is guilty for kicking Jesus out but I'm afraid there's too many leot of seeing so-called message people sitting in churches that are satisfied living in a grave that are satisfied living in habits that are satisfied living a halfway life they care more about their Sports than they care about [Applause] Easter they care more about the gods of Baal than they care about the God that's at The Showdown and will show up let me tell you the rest of them gods are still sitting in the grave now don't perk up on me and get all upset because cuz I talked about your Gods just for a minute but let me perk yourself up and tell you that there's power to get yourself out of them kind of graves if there wasn't power then I wouldn't preach it to you but because there is a power because there is a truth because there is a way because there is a life we have the abstract title deed of redemption that that quickening power has the [Applause] ability stuck in habits get up out of the grave stuck in Tomo get up out of the Grave you were not built for the grave you were built for the sky Hallelujah let me move on are y'all going to crucify me don't find no Nails what was it it was waved over the congregation how do you know it was waved over the congregation because when Peter was walking down an alley one day I probably didn't say that right walking down an alley walking down a street just his shadow cast over on a lady that was sitting there that was sick that had too going on but there's so much quickening power on the inside of Peter that just his shadow crossed over her he didn't touch her but the Hallelujah there was so much quickening power on the inside of Peter that when he walked by that she got up from her condition I don't care what condition that sh in I don't care what grave that you're in when Jesus walks by with an abstract it's a title deed you have every right it doesn't matter if your mom is a prostitute it doesn't matter if your dad's a boot ligger it doesn't matter where you are when the abstract Rolls by your way get ready to drop the needle get ready to drop the cigarettes get ready to drop the bottle I'm telling you right now he's in the room he's in the room let him pass by your way one time watch him watch him show up he'll roll the stone away he'll do the job he's still the same yesterday today and forever how many testimonies do I have in the room that is Easter it ain't just it ain't just a day but it's a life Easter doesn't just roll around once a year but Easter is every single day of our years [Applause] hallelujah what was it in this hour it was prophesied that it would wave over the congregation in Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 Revelations 10 what is it he was waved over in the son of man when it is the day when he's being revealed he was waved at the day of Pentecost and he was waved over this generation in this hour he was waved over the Pentecostal people that was up there waiting for the blessings to come but you don't have to wait for it no more Hallelujah they were waiting 10 days for it but that refreshing that came is here in the room that Pentecostal blessing is the confirmation of the Resurrection as Paul said in Ephesians 2 and 5 even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us hath made us alive together with Christ by grace are you saved and ha raised us up together and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's what William brandham said that the Pentecostal blessings is the confirmation of the Resurrection I love what the scripture says I love what it says in Ezekiel 37:12 we all look and we know we know what the first says the first part of it and we know how we how that the prophet stands there and the word of the Lord come unto him and said unto him do you see this valley of dry bones can they live again but notice what he says in verse 12 therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayith the Lord God behold oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and you shall know that I am the Lord Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves I'm giving you every bit of scripture to get up out of it and shall put my spirit in you notice he was speaking to Israel the natural but it's a compound scripture it's also speaking to spiritual Israel and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I will place you in your position I will place you in the road of an adopted son I will place you I will place you as the wave sheath has waved up for you I will place you in your land and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken it and performed it and saith the Lord oh blessed be the name of the Lord what was it when a man could catch a vision of a boy that had been seen in a vision dead two years before before it ever happened but because it was Easter again when that boy died on that finished border and he's setting there and William brandham walks up to him he said oh that's a terrible sight but there the hand of the Lord put his hand upon him said look at it again because there was a vision of Resurrection there was a vision of Resurrection that was coming by that little boy's way it's powerful but ability Billy Graham would have prayed if Billy Graham would have been there that boy would have still been there because Billy Graham didn't have a vision of him if or Roberts would have been there that boy would have still been laying there because there was another man in the hour that had a vision of a boy getting up again oh come on somebody he said if that boy's not up off the ground in 5 minutes you can call me a false prophet Hallelujah within a few moments had that boy's bone sticking out of his legs resurrection power rolled over top of him the same way that it rolled over top of the prodical son when he was down there living with the Hogs and he come to himself and said I will arise it's a resurrection time I will arise and go to my father's house prodal it's time to come to yourself it's time to have a resurrection and I ain't just talking about the prodigal out there here in the room here in the this is real this morning it's real this morning but you're going to come to yourself you've mocked it you've made fun of it and you set up the outside of the skirts just thinking I'm I'm not I'm not good enough to come back to the house of the Lord you don't backslide out there you backslide right here oh blessed be the name of the Lord but when he came to himself when he begin to remember who he was I've sat here I've sat in the presence of the Lord before I've sat there I've felt him I've known him but I'm so far out in my sin and my ideology that I can never come back but he came to himself when he come to to himself this is powerful when he come to himself his daddy had sat out there and he was watching for that boy he was waiting for that guy that had been there in spiritual Amnesia that who had forgotten who he was that forgot where he was he'd been Shell Shocked by leosia and he forgot who his daddy was but he started taking a walk and when he come across the hill hallelujah hallelujah when he come across the hill brother Denny the father was sitting up there he was waiting on him he was waiting on him the father was sitting right there how many people crossed that Hill the same day but it didn't catch the father's attention but this boy had something that attracted the father excuse me sister Connie it's too it's too good but when you came he didn't just grab one robe he grabbed the best robe he grabbed the best robe it's amazing how people God going there but it's amazing what people think I ain't just talking about sister Connie here but it's amazing what people what people try to think what kind of robe that that person [Music] deserves it's amazing how people will pick out what the pastor needs to do and what the pastor needs to say it's Easter and I feel like preaching he didn't go back there and get some worn out robe he didn't go back there and get some half fit robe he said go back there and get my best rope get my best rope I think it's pretty powerful sister Connie not just a robe but the best robe not just a man's robe but this pastor's robe and it was a sign before it's too powerful sister Connie it's too powerful that it was aign to all of hell that Easter was shining on you that Easter was real give him my best robe my best robe my best robe go get my ring [Applause] that when he walked back in Timothy it's too good man it's too good that when he walked back in he didn't look like somebody that's been in a pig pin are you with me he didn't look like somebody that been out there Walling around in the mud he come back out there and he look like a son in his first condition what did he do he resurrected him back to his status of a son even when he was down there in the pig pin he was always he was always right in drugs he was always a son in sin he was always a son in troubles he was always a son the father is putting the best robe over you you blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah you don't look like the world no more you don't smell like the world no more There Ain't No Grave the devil may have picked it out for you but There Ain't No [Applause] Grave the devil picked out Al Capia for Mariah puit but there was no grave going to hold her resurrection power down there was nothing going to stop it Little Drew Satan Satan tried to stop him from walking but there wasn't no grave going to hold his body down sister Judy he been too good to you he's been too good to you there wasn't no no grave going to keep you down sis he's been too good to you was No Grave going to hold you down brother Josh you may have been in some bad spots but there wasn't no grave going to hold you down you may have tried to bury yourself up with all kinds of dirt but the greater you bury yourself the greater your Resurrection hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah what is it it's a voice in this generation it's a voice of resurrection and that voice is in the bride's body to cause that Resurrection for the Bible said in John 5:25 verily verily I say unto you that the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear it shall live verse 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice I don't have to remind you what Graves that you came out of but don't it feel good to be alive try to put Lazarus back in there he's too alive to put him back in there he's too alive to put him back in there and it's enough it ain't just enough for him to stand outside of your grave and said l come forth I think it's powerful brother Bram said he said now look he said if he wouldn't have called Lazarus by name it would cause the general Resurrection it shows you how much power is in this voice that they that are dead and are in the graves shall come forth it ain't just enough to get up out of the Grave you got to unloose yourself that's what Jesus stood there and he said the same word in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away he used the same word when he was speaking about go there and you'll find a coat the the coat the fo of an ass said loose him for the master has need of him and he stands there you can hear in future home and he stands there and uses the same word when he's standing there at the grave of Lazarus and he said loose him loose him loose him and let him go come on somebody loose your feet loose your hands loose loose your mouth loose your joy loose your praise loose yourself because if the head got up out of the Grave then the body's got to get up out of the grave as well Easter proved that he wasn't just mechanics but he was the Dynamics of it as well that it wasn't just gasoline but it was spark there that's what Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 1:5 that the word came not unto you only in word only but in power and in demonstration brother bandam said he said it didn't come to you in gasoline only but it came to you also in spark that which you have received is the very Dynamic power to get you up out of the Grave that's why when Jesus is standing there in Luke 10 and 19 he said behold I give you power to tread upon serpents and to cast down Devils what is it William brandham is standing there and the resurrection and the resurrection servant and he's saying it is the rising of the sun he said there's been churches churches Brides brides but there's got to come one that's both mechanics and Dynamics well glory be to God I want to announce to you that you have arrived and you are that bride tumors dissipate tumors gone storms spoken out of existence little fishes raised back to life again prodal turned to themselves Georgie Carter tapped into a channel Congressman Upshaw was seen in a vision but what about Jeffrey Thomas come on what about the Baton family what about the hle family what about it somebody is tapping in to the channel that there is no grave that is going to hold this body down it doesn't matter what you put us in Dry Bones hear you the word of the Lord and I said prophesy we don't want just to stand there in our muscles man I got some real power brother bandam said that faith is a real homely thing it's got a hair on its chest got hair on its dress and sounds like a a mountain line when it screams out we don't want to just stand there show that we got muscles to believe that all things are possible we don't want to just stand there in the word and show that we've got the message of the hour we don't want to just stand there with the Flesh and the muscles and the senu we want some life to it come on let's be honest about it them denominations got power but they ain't got no life them them Pentecostals they got power they got muscles but they ain't got no life now come on this message didn't just come to you just to give you just to give you just another education it come to give you power Hallelujah I can feel it in a room the resurrection's in the room the raptures in the room I ain't just saying these things it's physically in the room what am I talking about the very spirit that raised Jesus from the dead There Ain't No Grave going to hold my body down there Ain't No Grave going to hold my body down on Resurrection morning I'm coming up out of that ground you were built to go a little bit higher you were built to go a little bit further it ain't just a song It's My Testimony it's my life it's my word oh somebody praise the lord it's a dawning of a new day they had Saturdays and they had Sundays before but this is is a different day it's a dawning of a new day it's s so n day oh come on somebody there ain't nothing going to hold you down there ain't no power going to keep you in the grave there ain't no sin if you're God's son predestinated Jean seed of God there's no power there's no power there's no demon Paul said there there be nothing that shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus not principality Not Angels not Powers not demons they have to recognize he is a Son of God and the rest of the world has to recognize that you are genan seeds of God the same power that rose up 2,000 years ago is the same power the same anointing the same truth that is in this bride's body that's why you can say There Ain't No Grave there ain't no trouble there ain't no situation there's no condition that can keep you where you are well early in the morning about to break a day that angel came from heaven and he rolled to Stone away what's he doing he's coming for you it's going to be somebody that takes a step brother Brandon when he's talking about talking about Elijah and Elisha he tells him he said he said it's a sign of two groups he said one's been caught up and the other one's playing catchup caught up catchup caught up catchup they have been caught up to meet him in the Lord but we will catch them that world is moving just a little bit faster than this world they see things they know things they understand things faster than we do and that realm they understand who you are in that realm they see you where you are they have already been caught up but one of these mornings we're going to catch up we're literally going to take a step from this body into that theophany and we shall be made like him in a moment in a twinkling of an eye what is it it's the balance it's the balance of the Translating wing and the balance of the Resurrection ction Wing that they that died in faith will go with us hallelujah who is that resurrection power who are them dead Saints the ones that died in faith and if you could just tap into it he's just right around the bin just right around the corner sister Phyllis the vision that you caught the other day was not in vain it's not in vain because you see them and it's a sign to us that we're very close we're very close I know Satan likes to play with your mind and tell you that that wasn't right but I I want to say it's very real very real they're just a little bit there they just a little bit there as we get closer and closer in the blending of Dimensions what is it what is it is that close is that
