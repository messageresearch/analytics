[44:31] make you welcome here this morning God
[44:33] richly bless you
[44:35] amen Isn't Our Lord Jesus so wonderful
[44:39] he's so lovely to us
[44:42] amen Genesis chapter
[44:45] 15 and verse
[44:48] one after these things the word of the
[44:51] Lord came unto Abram if you remember
[44:54] that you'll remember that just on the
[44:56] other side side of the page that you'll
[44:58] remember that there is where Abram went
[45:00] and brought back lot and and there he
[45:03] sat down with MDC and MDC he gave tithes
[45:06] and offered up to mzc there but he says
[45:10] after these things the word of the Lord
[45:11] came unto Abram it's always amazing that
[45:14] after the event of his presence that
[45:17] there the Lord begins to speak to him
[45:19] saying in a vision saying fear not Abram
[45:22] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[45:25] reward and ABR said Lord God what will
[45:28] thou give me see and I go childless and
[45:31] the steward of my house is Elie is this
[45:33] elaser of Damascus and Abram said behold
[45:37] to me behold to me thou Hast given no
[45:40] seed and lo one born in my house is mine
[45:43] Heir and behold the word of the Lord
[45:46] came unto him saying this shall not be
[45:48] thine Heir but he that shall come forth
[45:51] out of thine own bows shall be thine
[45:54] Heir and he brought him forth abroad and
[45:56] said look now towards heaven and tell
[45:59] the Stars if thou be able to number them
[46:02] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[46:05] be and he believed in the Lord and he
[46:08] counted it unto him for righteousness
[46:12] also Genesis chapter 17 and verse
[46:25] one and when Abram was 99 90 years old
[46:31] and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and
[46:33] said unto him I am the almighty God
[46:36] ain't that just beautiful I am the
[46:39] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[46:42] perfect I will make my Covenant between
[46:45] me and thee and will multiply thee
[46:48] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[46:50] and God talked with him saying as for me
[46:53] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[46:56] shal sh be a father of many nations
[46:59] neither shall thy name anymore be called
[47:02] Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for
[47:05] a father of many nations have I made
[47:08] thee may God bless his word you may be
[47:10] seated here in the presence of the Lord
[47:13] I would like to speak to you today on a
[47:15] thought of I am your portion I am your
[47:20] portion and we we'd like to just look at
[47:22] that that today that he is the alls
[47:24] sufficient one the Almighty El shouldi
[47:27] he is he is the breasted God the
[47:31] almighty one and we we look at this word
[47:33] in the English portion it means a part
[47:36] of a thing separated from it a part
[47:39] though actually may not be divided but
[47:41] it's considered by itself it is a part
[47:44] assigned in an allotment or a dividend
[47:48] it's a portion of it it's just like when
[47:50] Jesus is standing there right before his
[47:52] Ascension and he says behold I send the
[47:54] promise of my father upon you but tar ye
[47:57] in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[47:59] endued with power from on high what was
[48:02] it is that Jesus was getting ready to
[48:04] pay forward the dividends as as the bank
[48:07] of Heaven he was getting ready to pour
[48:09] out so we recognize that there was a
[48:12] promise that was over top of the
[48:14] children of God that was sitting there
[48:15] and we know this that A promise is a
[48:18] revelation of intention so if God if God
[48:21] promises something it is a revelation to
[48:24] us that God is intending to do something
[48:27] and we see and understand that under the
[48:29] Covenant that God had made with Abraham
[48:31] and his seed that his seed was going to
[48:33] have an inheritance in a land that was
[48:36] promised to Abraham even though Abram
[48:39] Abraham would never walk in that land
[48:41] but it was promised to his seed that he
[48:43] would walk in that land and there we
[48:45] recognize by the scriptures that Moses
[48:47] was born to bring them out of Egypt and
[48:50] it was Joshua's commission to bring them
[48:52] in and to divide the inheritance or the
[48:55] portion of the land in which they were
[48:57] allotted to be a part of and we know
[49:00] this that that that when God allots
[49:02] something to us there's nothing that can
[49:04] stand in our place or there's nothing
[49:07] that can take our position or the
[49:08] portion of what God has intended for our
[49:11] for our life and we know this that when
[49:14] you begin to study out the Book of
[49:15] Joshua that you'll find that we are even
[49:18] now today under a Joshua commission that
[49:20] we recognize that under Moses it was his
[49:23] it was his leadership it was it was his
[49:26] ministry to bring them out but it was
[49:28] Joshua's Ministry to bring them into the
[49:31] promised land and to divide the portion
[49:33] of the inheritance to each and every one
[49:35] of them and if you want to go and study
[49:37] that out you'll just go study Joshua
[49:39] chapter 13 where Joshua lays out all the
[49:42] borders of each tribe where they are to
[49:44] be parted and even the other two that
[49:46] were on the back side of the of the
[49:48] other side of the of the sea or the
[49:51] river of Jordan there but we understand
[49:54] that every single one of those when they
[49:55] begin to get and and the distribution of
[49:59] their portion it was exactly how God
[50:02] lined it out it was exactly by the law
[50:05] it was by the line it was by the measure
[50:07] so that every tribe had a proper portion
[50:11] according to his inheritance so we know
[50:13] this that when when God lays out an
[50:16] inheritance for his children it's
[50:18] measured out for them so I want you to
[50:20] know that today that you have been given
[50:22] an opportunity to receive of a measure
[50:25] of the Lord that has been GR it to the
[50:27] body of Jesus Christ and if you look at
[50:29] Psalm 78 and 54 that the Bible says here
[50:33] that he brought them to the border of
[50:35] his Sanctuary even to this mountain
[50:38] which his right hand had purchased verse
[50:40] 55 that he cast out the Heathen also
[50:43] before them and divided them an
[50:46] inheritance by line an inheritance by
[50:49] line and made the tribes of Israel to
[50:52] dwell in their tents so God is very
[50:54] specific about his children
[50:57] receiving their promise according as he
[50:59] has lined it out notice in Numbers
[51:01] chapter 18 that we find 18 and 20 that
[51:04] you'll find that God when he lays out
[51:07] you can study out the Book of Leviticus
[51:08] you can study out the book of numbers
[51:10] and you'll find that the Levites in
[51:13] verse 20 it said that the Lord spake
[51:14] unto Abram Thou shalt have no
[51:17] inheritance in their land neither shall
[51:20] have thou any part among them but I am
[51:23] thy part and I am thine inheritance
[51:25] amongst the children of Israel so you
[51:27] find that God was the Levites portion so
[51:31] we so we recognize that even though they
[51:34] didn't have a portion in the land but
[51:36] God was their portion ain't it wonderful
[51:38] to know that today that God has made us
[51:41] Kings and Priests that we are sitting
[51:44] here today under the authority of God's
[51:46] word that God have said in Revelations
[51:49] 5:10 that I have made you notice you
[51:52] didn't make yourself this he said I have
[51:54] made you I have made you Kings and
[51:57] Priests and he says he goes on to say
[51:59] that then in Numbers Chapter 3 and 12
[52:02] and behold I have taken the Levites from
[52:05] amongst the children of Israel instead
[52:07] of the firstborn that opened the Matrix
[52:10] amongst the children of Israel therefore
[52:12] the Levites shall be mine and even
[52:15] though the Levites may have not had a
[52:16] portion of land they had the greatest
[52:18] portion that there ever could be because
[52:20] land could be fought for and land could
[52:23] be stolen but the portion of the Levites
[52:25] could never be taken away from from them
[52:27] and I want you to know that God is very
[52:28] clear upon this that's why he says it
[52:30] over and over again that you are Kings
[52:33] and you are priest again in Deuteronomy
[52:36] chapter 32 and8 it said that when the
[52:38] most high divided to the Nations their
[52:41] inheritance when he separated the sons
[52:43] of Adam he set the bounds of the people
[52:46] according to the number of the children
[52:48] of Israel verse 9 it says for the Lord's
[52:51] portion is his people Jacob is the lot
[52:55] of his inheritance so today I want you
[52:57] to Pat yourself on the back and so I
[52:59] want you to recognize that you're not
[53:01] just anybody you're the Lord's
[53:04] portion I don't know if you understand
[53:06] what I'm saying to you just at this
[53:07] moment the god that created the moons
[53:09] and the stars the one that told Abraham
[53:12] that I will make thy seed look up there
[53:15] in the stars and see if you can number
[53:16] them I am the god that created all of
[53:19] them and God is saying I am your portion
[53:22] and you are my portion do you recognize
[53:25] that today that you are fulfilling your
[53:28] position as the part of the body of
[53:30] Jesus Christ a voice of many Waters the
[53:33] last runners in this generation that we
[53:35] are sounding for every messenger
[53:37] throughout all the Seven Ages we are
[53:40] under the culmination of all these
[53:41] things and we are carrying our portion
[53:44] and this bride of Jesus Christ she is
[53:46] not hindered she is running her race she
[53:49] this this what is happening is a
[53:51] culmination of every voice and there is
[53:54] no excuse that is holding the body back
[53:56] because election is greater than your
[53:59] excuse his choice for you is greater
[54:01] than your mistakes your choice man's
[54:04] choice but his choice is greater than
[54:07] you greater than your choice so let me
[54:09] say it like this your this message chose
[54:12] you and there is nothing other than the
[54:15] influence of the heavenly host that is
[54:18] causing the bride to realize that this
[54:20] is her person this is her portion that
[54:23] this is her purpose to fulfill the last
[54:26] race
[54:27] that's what brother Brandon would say in
[54:28] Jehovah Gyra he would say to believe the
[54:31] word is to receive the word and to let
[54:33] it become life it's not something that
[54:36] we have left off or we've left it off
[54:38] for another day or try to put it off
[54:39] onto somebody else but to believe the
[54:42] word is to receive the word and let it
[54:44] become life you see but the individual
[54:47] and God has become the Same Spirit God's
[54:49] purpose in the beginning that Adam and
[54:52] Eve Was the Same Spirit Eve was she was
[54:55] bone of his bone she was life of his
[54:57] life she was flesh of his flesh every
[55:00] action that Eve made was a mimic of what
[55:02] Adam had made that's why you can look at
[55:05] this body of Jesus Christ and you can
[55:07] see none other than our Lord Jesus
[55:09] Christ operating through the bride's
[55:11] body why because she is under the same
[55:14] fulfillment of John chapter 14 and 12
[55:17] that the works that I do shall you do
[55:19] also so think it not strange when you
[55:22] take these works when you take this life
[55:24] when you take this power and you see the
[55:27] manifestation of your portion coming to
[55:29] pass why because you are under the
[55:32] greatest Commission because the modern
[55:34] Church cannot fulfill this commission
[55:37] they can't run this race because they've
[55:39] not received an end time message like
[55:41] you have received but you are sitting
[55:43] here the borders have been lined
[55:46] out the borders have been lined out
[55:49] everything is in its order everything is
[55:51] in its place and things are lined out
[55:54] exactly where they need to be that's why
[55:57] William Brandon when he comes and he
[55:58] preaches the Feast of the trumpets he
[56:00] comes in there and he lines out all the
[56:03] borders so that the Bri of Jesus Christ
[56:06] no longer has to guess at who she is no
[56:08] longer has to worry about who she is but
[56:11] she's there under her commission and
[56:14] when Joshua was in his commission Joshua
[56:17] had an Angelic Covenant he had an
[56:19] Angelic event that took place in his
[56:21] life where MDC came and talked to him
[56:24] and said don't be afraid as a was with
[56:26] Moses so I will be with
[56:29] you so I will be with you don't you
[56:32] recognize the same voice that was
[56:34] speaking to William Brandon that spoke
[56:35] to him don't you fear to go anywhere or
[56:38] do anything for the never failing
[56:39] presence of Jesus Christ is with you
[56:42] always that that was not just a voice
[56:44] for William brandham that's a voice for
[56:46] our little children you don't have to be
[56:48] afraid you don't have to fear where
[56:50] you're going you are under a commission
[56:52] by an Angel under the seventh Angel's
[56:55] message don't you fear to go anywhere
[56:58] don't you fear to touch
[56:59] anything Hallelujah and when Joshua knew
[57:03] who he was standing with and who was
[57:04] standing with him he was not fighting
[57:07] his battles all by
[57:08] himself it was the Lord that was
[57:11] fighting his battles that's why Joshua
[57:13] could stand there when the sun was
[57:15] looking him at his in his face and it
[57:17] was going down that Joshua brought it
[57:19] back in his right position because he
[57:21] recognized it was his
[57:24] portion he had the ability as a Son of
[57:27] God to look to the son and speak to the
[57:29] son and say son stand
[57:32] still what was it Joshua was operating
[57:35] by the absolute that he had he believed
[57:38] in his absolute he believed in his
[57:41] absolute and brother randam said that
[57:42] sometime when you take an absolute an
[57:45] absolute will lead you to a paradox and
[57:47] when you tie your soul to this message
[57:50] it'll lead you to a
[57:51] paradox I know the world calls you crazy
[57:54] and the world calls you an oddball but
[57:56] it's okay it's okay what you are tied to
[58:00] will lead you to a
[58:02] paradox I know that it may seem strange
[58:05] that that we have marriages that have
[58:07] lasted over 60 years amongst our ranks
[58:10] and they've been perfected it's because
[58:13] it's because this absolute has led them
[58:16] to a paradox I know it's I know it might
[58:18] seem strange to you that little bitty
[58:20] 16y old girls can believe this message
[58:23] and live real holy life I know it's
[58:25] strange to to a lot of the world it's
[58:27] our absolute that we're tied to and we
[58:29] it'll produce the Paradox I know it
[58:32] might be strange for you young boys to
[58:34] live a real overcoming life in front of
[58:36] the world and they may understand why
[58:37] you do like you do it's because you're
[58:39] tied to your absolute and your absolute
[58:43] will produce a
[58:45] paradox this ain't just about speaking
[58:47] squirrels into existence this ain't just
[58:49] about speaking storms out of existence
[58:51] it's talking about living an overcoming
[58:54] life
[58:57] the reason why you can press the battle
[58:58] so hard is because you're tied to an
[59:00] absolute and you are tied to that
[59:02] absolute and it will produce the
[59:07] miraculous what is it what was it what
[59:10] was there in God's mind has now been
[59:12] revealed has been revealed to this body
[59:15] to think that there you were all the
[59:17] time in God's
[59:18] mind before there was a molecule that
[59:21] was ever formed or an atom that was ever
[59:23] spoken into existence you were there in
[59:26] God's mind to think that you could go
[59:28] back millions and millions and millions
[59:30] of years before clinkers were ever spoke
[59:33] into existence and the almighty God
[59:35] would roll them off of his fingertips
[59:37] that you were there in the back part of
[59:39] his mind this whole event that you see
[59:41] as the earth and the cosmos is do so
[59:44] that his body could come forth in this
[59:48] hour why because you are his
[59:52] portion if you don't hear anything else
[59:54] I say today hear this yes you are God's
[59:58] portion you are God's portion but he is
[1:00:01] your
[1:00:02] portion Hallelujah you see when God once
[1:00:05] reveals it you receive it as your
[1:00:07] property you see if it's if he begins to
[1:00:10] reveal the secrets of the heart what is
[1:00:13] he doing he's revealing his mind you so
[1:00:16] we see when we begin to see the very
[1:00:19] Supernatural come amongst the body of
[1:00:21] Believers and we see the supernatural
[1:00:23] begin to whether it's however it comes
[1:00:25] in miraculous healings or or
[1:00:27] demonstrations it's the very mind of
[1:00:30] Christ that's what William Brandon would
[1:00:31] say in the seven seal that the
[1:00:34] Supernatural is the mind of Christ and
[1:00:37] when the supernatural begins to take
[1:00:39] place and hearts are being discerned and
[1:00:41] secrets are being revealed you could say
[1:00:43] it that like like Amazon texts you a
[1:00:46] package that it has been delivered when
[1:00:49] God begins to discern the very secrets
[1:00:51] of your heart the package has been
[1:00:54] delivered the things that you ask
[1:00:56] and the things that you get are
[1:00:58] according to the revelation of his mind
[1:01:01] now a lot of people can't understand the
[1:01:02] package a lot of people can't understand
[1:01:05] what is going on here but this is
[1:01:07] something that only an elect group can
[1:01:11] understand what is it it's the language
[1:01:14] of a dynamic people that believe that
[1:01:16] they have the ability to go out there
[1:01:18] and create themselves an own world and
[1:01:21] live on
[1:01:22] it that's an amazing thing to do create
[1:01:25] yourself an own own world and go out
[1:01:27] there and live a private life on it you
[1:01:29] have the ability to speak a world into
[1:01:31] existence and go out there and live in
[1:01:34] it what are you doing brother Angel I'm
[1:01:36] telling you that by Your Atmosphere you
[1:01:39] have the abilities to speak a world into
[1:01:42] existence ain't it amazing when you're
[1:01:44] sitting there and your boss has done
[1:01:46] chewed you out and you have the ability
[1:01:48] to go create yourself your own little
[1:01:50] atmosphere create your own little world
[1:01:52] and go out there and live on it just for
[1:01:53] a few minutes till you get your emotions
[1:01:55] back in check
[1:01:56] I'd say that sometimes in your life you
[1:01:58] need to create some of those worlds go
[1:01:59] live on them maybe when your wife makes
[1:02:01] you mad maybe why when your husband
[1:02:03] makes you angry when he didn't put up
[1:02:04] his clothes when he done told him three
[1:02:06] or four times go out there and create
[1:02:07] yourself a old world and go live on at
[1:02:09] one time it's an amazing thing that the
[1:02:12] ability that the Sons and Daughters of
[1:02:14] God have that they can go out there and
[1:02:16] create a world and go live in it but
[1:02:18] brother random said whatever the Lord
[1:02:20] leads your soul to believe you can have
[1:02:23] it now he's not going to lead you to
[1:02:25] believe something crazy or something
[1:02:27] that's fanatical or outside of the
[1:02:28] Realms of his word but whatever he leads
[1:02:31] your soul to believe go ahead it's yours
[1:02:34] every place that The Souls of your foot
[1:02:36] Shall Set upon by faith God gives it to
[1:02:40] you Hallelujah he is your portion he was
[1:02:46] David's portion David was very clear
[1:02:49] when he was talking to saw when there
[1:02:51] was a Goliath a giant down there and he
[1:02:53] was defying the armies of the Living God
[1:02:55] J David was standing there and saying
[1:02:57] the Lord is my portion the Lord deliver
[1:03:00] me out of the Paw of a bear the Lord
[1:03:02] deliver me out of the Paw of a Lon
[1:03:04] notice what David was doing he was
[1:03:06] putting the accounts of the battle back
[1:03:08] on the one that the victory came from
[1:03:11] and when you can turn around and say
[1:03:13] that your portion that you are receiving
[1:03:16] came from the Lord that the victories
[1:03:19] that are on their Road are coming from
[1:03:21] the Lord you don't understand what's
[1:03:23] breaking forth in this place Visions are
[1:03:26] breaking forth Visions are breaking
[1:03:28] forth and there are people that are
[1:03:30] breaking forth into Victory I want you
[1:03:32] to know you don't have to live outside
[1:03:34] of your Victory this
[1:03:35] morning you don't have to live outside
[1:03:38] of your god-given privileges this
[1:03:39] morning you have every right to walk in
[1:03:42] there as the portion of the body of
[1:03:44] Jesus Christ and go out there and accept
[1:03:47] your Victory this
[1:03:49] morning there's going to be somebody
[1:03:51] that believes that the victory that is
[1:03:53] in the room is for them there's going to
[1:03:55] be somebody that believes that the
[1:03:57] manifestation of the gifts of the Holy
[1:03:58] Ghost is for them this
[1:04:01] morning I know it's a little far reached
[1:04:04] but it ain't that far from you remember
[1:04:06] it's just that close that other world's
[1:04:08] that close your Victory is in the room
[1:04:11] your Victory is in the room but we are
[1:04:13] living in an age where men look so close
[1:04:17] like the
[1:04:19] reality that's exactly what Jesus would
[1:04:21] say he would tell us in Matthew 24 that
[1:04:24] it would be so close close in the last
[1:04:26] day that it would deceive the very elect
[1:04:28] if it was possible is that right if if
[1:04:32] it was possible and brother random said
[1:04:33] that people can live so close to it he
[1:04:36] said they can live a life where they
[1:04:37] don't drink they don't go out and they
[1:04:39] don't go out and gamble they don't go
[1:04:41] out and lie they don't go out and do all
[1:04:43] kinds of adulatory Acts he said but they
[1:04:45] still not be with it he said but this is
[1:04:48] the age of the personal life of Jesus
[1:04:51] Christ so you you can live close to it
[1:04:53] you can be close to it but it's still
[1:04:55] not be the overcoming life actually it's
[1:04:58] really dangerous it's more dangerous for
[1:05:00] those that sat there and look at it and
[1:05:03] never
[1:05:04] accepted then for those that are are the
[1:05:06] real reality but this is the age of the
[1:05:10] personal life of Jesus Christ I know
[1:05:13] that a lot of times when when you get to
[1:05:14] preaching about that having the real
[1:05:16] thing that it makes you begin to squirm
[1:05:18] and it's not just about being a believer
[1:05:20] in Jesus Christ coming and dying on the
[1:05:23] cross it's about having the very life
[1:05:25] life and the attributes of the father
[1:05:28] living in the
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:30] body now no no I know we done further
[1:05:33] down the road and that we're not going
[1:05:35] to receive a reward of of just just
[1:05:38] Pentecostalism we are going to receive
[1:05:41] the very reward of the person of life
[1:05:45] itself now let me tell you if if we've
[1:05:47] spent all of our time and just preaching
[1:05:50] this message and all it does is produce
[1:05:53] a greater a greater Baptist Church or a
[1:05:56] greater Assemblies of God Church than we
[1:05:58] are wasting our times but if we are
[1:06:01] producing the same life the same power
[1:06:04] the same Miracles the same works the
[1:06:07] same actions is there anybody going to
[1:06:10] help me Preach Today if we are producing
[1:06:13] what Jesus was producing then it's got
[1:06:16] to be full proof that we are the full
[1:06:18] body under the full
[1:06:21] headship let me tell you this was not
[1:06:23] William brandom's doing this is God's
[1:06:26] doing and it is marvelous in our eyes
[1:06:28] this is not brother Homer's doing this
[1:06:30] is not brother Ron's doing this is the
[1:06:32] Lord's
[1:06:33] doing if man could have done it man
[1:06:36] would have done it a long time ago and
[1:06:38] man would have done went into a Rapture
[1:06:40] but this is the final age a final People
[1:06:43] final
[1:06:46] Believers Hallelujah notice notice what
[1:06:50] the Bible says in Revelations 2: 7 that
[1:06:53] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:06:55] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[1:06:57] midst of the paradise so we recognize
[1:07:00] that this future reward is for all
[1:07:03] Overcomers throughout all the ages that
[1:07:06] this was the portion and shall be the
[1:07:09] portion of the Overcomer is the tree of
[1:07:12] life you can search out the Bible and
[1:07:14] you can see the Tree of Life all the way
[1:07:16] from Genesis to Revelation he was that
[1:07:19] one that was back there in the Garden of
[1:07:21] Eden he was the tree of life he was the
[1:07:24] author of life and and we know what the
[1:07:26] tree is it's a person so we understand
[1:07:29] that we are living in an hour of the
[1:07:31] personal life of Jesus Christ if he was
[1:07:34] there in the Garden of Eden as the tree
[1:07:36] of life he will surely be there in the
[1:07:39] paradise of God as the person of
[1:07:43] life he is your
[1:07:49] reward you ever went to a ball game ever
[1:07:52] went to a ball game and nobody gave you
[1:07:54] a trophy
[1:07:57] and you felt like you needed a
[1:08:00] trophy so you get yourself to make your
[1:08:02] own
[1:08:05] trophy thank you brother
[1:08:09] duck some of you get it today if you
[1:08:11] want to know ask brother Doug
[1:08:13] later but when you don't get the trophy
[1:08:16] that you deserved God said I am your
[1:08:20] reward I am your reward and it's easy to
[1:08:23] look out there on the rest of the world
[1:08:25] and see them how do people live any just
[1:08:27] a kind of a life and get by with
[1:08:29] it they're not getting by with
[1:08:32] it you look out there and say well them
[1:08:34] them people get by with it they get by
[1:08:36] with doing this they get by with doing
[1:08:37] that they're not getting by with
[1:08:40] it but I I don't care what what others
[1:08:43] do and I don't care what other other
[1:08:44] religions do as long as I please
[1:08:48] him because I'm not fully satisfied
[1:08:52] until he's
[1:08:53] satisfied and it's easily to it's easy
[1:08:56] to look out there on the rest of the
[1:08:58] world and see the rest of the world out
[1:09:00] there in Egypt prospering and you down
[1:09:02] there in Egypt building building bricks
[1:09:05] it's easy to get your eyes on the wrong
[1:09:07] thing and get your eyes on the blessings
[1:09:09] of Egypt instead of the promise of
[1:09:12] Israel it's so easy sometimes to look
[1:09:14] out there lay Osa and see them
[1:09:16] prospering they ain't living the kind of
[1:09:18] message that you're living they're not
[1:09:20] living the kind of Holiness that you're
[1:09:21] living but yet it seems like they're on
[1:09:23] top of the mountain all the time
[1:09:26] but God says I am your
[1:09:30] portion when William Brandon's out there
[1:09:33] in Oklahoma and he comes out of TL osbor
[1:09:36] or he comes out of ARL Roberts he comes

[1:09:44] hundreds of people working in that
[1:09:46] University he comes out brother R said
[1:09:49] he was sitting there and he said Satan
[1:09:50] started talking to me and he said God
[1:09:54] don't trust you
[1:09:56] he knew that if he give you these kind
[1:09:58] of elements that you'd fail him so he
[1:10:01] couldn't make you a rich man he couldn't
[1:10:03] give you all these things that or
[1:10:04] Roberts and TL osburn's

[1:18:17] Lord is the
[1:18:19] portion of my inheritance
[1:18:26] there a song We I think we used to sing
[1:18:29] it maybe used to sing it Long As I
[1:18:32] Got King
[1:18:33] Jesus Long As I Got King Jesus Long As I
[1:18:37] Got King Jesus I don't need nobody
[1:18:43] is he is the portion of M inher we going
[1:18:47] to have to work that one back in if you
[1:18:48] didn't sing it we're going to sing
[1:18:50] it that's how we do things up here just
[1:18:53] be ready after service just kidding we
[1:18:56] ain't working on that kind of
[1:18:57] inspiration today but the Lord is a
[1:19:00] portion of my inheritance so as long as
[1:19:02] you Got King
[1:19:05] Jesus all right as long as you got as
[1:19:09] long as the Lord is your portion and the
[1:19:11] inheritance of my cup when you look at
[1:19:14] that word that cup it means the man's
[1:19:17] life or his lot or his condition of life
[1:19:20] so look at Psalms 11 and6 notice the
[1:19:23] condition of the wicked upon the wicked
[1:19:25] he shall reain snares fire and brimstone
[1:19:28] and horrible Tempest this shall be the
[1:19:30] portion of their cup notice the wicked's
[1:19:34] condition but notice what David says
[1:19:37] about the believer's position that my
[1:19:39] cup runneth over and surely goodness and
[1:19:42] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:19:45] life my conditions of Life are laid out
[1:19:49] by the Lord in specific spots that's why
[1:19:53] you can never be blessed outside of this
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] message
[1:20:00] Hallelujah you tried everything you
[1:20:03] wanted to in life you tried to enjoy
[1:20:05] drinking you tried to enjoy living that
[1:20:08] kind of life it was pleasurable for a
[1:20:10] season but the lines didn't fall to you
[1:20:13] there the lines were roped off around
[1:20:17] the message let me say it to you like
[1:20:19] job said job you got a hedge of
[1:20:21] protection around you there's a fence
[1:20:24] around your
[1:20:27] borders what was it something on the
[1:20:29] inside of you was thirsting for the
[1:20:31] portion of
[1:20:32] life so you tried to satisfy that
[1:20:35] portion with filthy living with idolatry
[1:20:38] with drinking and
[1:20:40] smoking and some of it even wasn't that
[1:20:43] bad it was just putting yourself in
[1:20:45] front of the Lord you tried to satisfy
[1:20:48] yourself that
[1:20:50] way but until you got into your borders
[1:20:55] you know good and
[1:20:57] well I I I'll be honest I about to had
[1:21:00] myself a shouting fit last
[1:21:05] night I had to be honest with you about
[1:21:09] more than this these 16 elements could
[1:21:11] handle here last night watching
[1:21:14] those that said they had made a decision
[1:21:17] I'll never go back to that church no
[1:21:22] more I tell you what you begin to look
[1:21:25] at that
[1:21:27] crowd there some real generals and some
[1:21:29] real queens in that crowd and some real
[1:21:32] genuine filled Holy Ghost people in that
[1:21:35] crowd you see because they they made a
[1:21:37] they made a decision they made a
[1:21:39] decision in their mind I'm not going
[1:21:41] back to that church but there was a gene
[1:21:43] seed of
[1:21:44] God that wouldn't let wouldn't let them
[1:21:47] get outside of their
[1:21:49] borders I tell you what when you begin
[1:21:51] to think about how the grace of God Ran
[1:21:53] after you brother Jim and thought you
[1:21:55] was going to go your own way and thought
[1:21:56] you was going to go after your own
[1:21:57] election and after your own choice but
[1:21:59] God's election so fit that you would
[1:22:02] live inside of these walls let me tell
[1:22:04] you these walls ain't Prison Walls these
[1:22:06] walls are castle walls and if you look
[1:22:09] at it in the right aspect God is keeping
[1:22:11] you from everything out there and
[1:22:13] outside of the
[1:22:14] world this ain't laws of dos and don'ts
[1:22:17] it's a law of almighty God it's a life
[1:22:20] of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:28] Hallelujah you didn't choose yourself
[1:22:31] you didn't make yourself believe this
[1:22:34] you tried with everything within your
[1:22:36] power to disbelieve it matter of fact
[1:22:39] most of us came to this message trying
[1:22:41] to prove it
[1:22:52] wrong brother Donnie Reagan said he said
[1:22:55] he said I was under my trinitarian
[1:22:58] Doctrine and he said the same scriptures
[1:23:00] I was using for my trinitarian Doctrine
[1:23:03] when the god revealed it he said I prove
[1:23:05] he said God proved it to me that I was
[1:23:07] in the wrong he said and I started using
[1:23:09] those same
[1:23:10] scriptures to prove this side of the
[1:23:13] Oneness of God what was it he had to get
[1:23:16] on the right side of the fence he had to
[1:23:18] get right on the right side where the
[1:23:20] lines had fallen under him you see if
[1:23:22] you can ever get to the spot where you
[1:23:24] recognize it ain't you you ain't got
[1:23:27] nothing to do with this I appreciate
[1:23:29] every one of our families here I
[1:23:31] appreciate the Fraser family I
[1:23:33] appreciate the breeding and the and the
[1:23:34] and the Meadows family and and the
[1:23:36] Fraser and the Spencers and all of them
[1:23:38] but this has nothing to do with
[1:23:40] that this has nothing to do with that we
[1:23:43] are a family
[1:23:46] here I don't care if your name's Martin
[1:23:49] I don't matter it don't matter if your
[1:23:51] name's quer it don't matter if your
[1:23:52] name's no hell it don't matter if your
[1:23:54] name's
[1:23:55] Damron this is the heritage of the most
[1:23:59] high
[1:24:04] God
[1:24:07] hallelujah
[1:24:11] hallelujah but when it come to Abraham's
[1:24:14] time of life when he was 99 years
[1:24:19] old the Lord appeared to
[1:24:22] him you go back and you study out them
[1:24:25] scriptures Genesis 14 Genesis 15 Genesis
[1:24:29] 16 and then you flip over to Genesis 17
[1:24:33] you got to think one chapter before
[1:24:36] Hagar has been introduced to Abraham's
[1:24:38] Ministry and he's trying to produce a
[1:24:41] New Birth by his own Ministry but he
[1:24:44] can't do
[1:24:46] it but it's 13 years later when God
[1:24:50] speaks to him in Genesis chapter 17
[1:24:53] ishmael's a teenager at this time and
[1:24:56] God is talking to Abraham you're still
[1:24:58] not too old for
[1:25:00] this you're still not too old you're
[1:25:03] still not too stoop shoulders you're
[1:25:05] still not because why I am l o him I am
[1:25:11] the almighty God I am the author of
[1:25:15] strength and of power I am El
[1:25:18] shed the almighty the most powerful
[1:25:24] I have spent some time this week going
[1:25:26] through going through the commentators
[1:25:28] and going through the
[1:25:31] theologians none of these none of these
[1:25:34] it's amazing it's amazing the incredible
[1:25:38] Revelation that William brandham
[1:25:40] had to tap into the revelation of elhad
[1:25:45] because all of those theologians
[1:25:47] disagreed or couldn't come up with the
[1:25:49] same idea on what elhad meant so it
[1:25:52] shows to us that elhad
[1:25:55] is a a powerful re Revelation that comes
[1:25:58] from almighty God and when God begins to
[1:26:01] declare himself by the name Eli he was
[1:26:05] showing to Abram when he was still in
[1:26:07] his insufficiency he was saying to Abram
[1:26:10] I am your strength you see Abram was
[1:26:14] insufficient to bring Isaac to into
[1:26:16] fruition but the name El Shi upon
[1:26:20] Abraham was showing that he was going to
[1:26:23] be the one that was undertaking for
[1:26:25] Abraham's behalf it was a solemn promise
[1:26:29] from the almighty God that eladi is the
[1:26:32] breast of God and there he appears to
[1:26:35] him in Genesis 17 as the almighty God
[1:26:40] when it looks like all hope was gone God
[1:26:44] says it ain't over till I say it's over
[1:26:47] he appears in the name of elad when
[1:26:50] you're 99 years old when you're running
[1:26:52] out a rope God thrs you you a l when
[1:26:55] you're running out of hope God gives you
[1:26:57] faith when you're running out of Destiny
[1:26:59] God gives you a
[1:27:01] revelation what is he doing he begins to
[1:27:04] declare himself as the breasted One what
[1:27:07] does it mean it means to draw strength
[1:27:10] out of the almighty God it's like a
[1:27:12] woman's breast when she's feeding that
[1:27:14] little baby what is she doing that baby
[1:27:17] does not know how to live but all he
[1:27:19] knows how to do is pull the very
[1:27:21] strength out of his mother that's why
[1:27:23] God gave you a two breasted book of the
[1:27:26] old and the New Testament so that when
[1:27:29] you don't feel strong enough he is your
[1:27:31] strength when you don't feel powerful
[1:27:33] enough you can say let the weak say I
[1:27:39] am when you don't feel like you're
[1:27:42] adequate enough he says I am your
[1:27:44] strength what is it he said I am your
[1:27:48] strength when your strength is all gone
[1:27:51] God stand before him and said I am El sh
[1:27:54] I am the breasted God so what was
[1:27:56] Abraham doing he was drawing his
[1:27:59] strength out of the strongest one that
[1:28:02] there ever has
[1:28:05] been now let me tell you this God ain't
[1:28:08] only just a lifegiver to Abraham but he
[1:28:10] was proving to him that I am your
[1:28:15] satisfier now you husbands know good and
[1:28:18] well you know good and well that you
[1:28:21] ain't got what that baby needs to
[1:28:23] satisfy
[1:28:24] but that Mama is equipped in such a way
[1:28:27] that she can satisfy that little baby
[1:28:30] there is something that she has built
[1:28:31] with in that way to produce what that
[1:28:34] baby needs and you know good and well in
[1:28:37] your own Humanity that you do not have
[1:28:39] the sufficiency to satisfy that longing
[1:28:42] heart that's why you've got to lean upon
[1:28:45] the breasted one and pull your strength
[1:28:47] out of it I know your joy might be gone
[1:28:50] but lean on the bosom of Abraham's
[1:28:52] Abraham's God of el Shad ey I know it
[1:28:54] seemed like you ain't had peace in a
[1:28:56] long time but why don't you lay on the
[1:28:58] bosom of el
[1:29:00] Shad I know you may feel like yeah
[1:29:02] you're not able to make it into the
[1:29:04] Rapture but why don't you lay on the
[1:29:05] bosom of el
[1:29:09] sh I know what I'm talking about I know
[1:29:12] what I'm talking about I had to go there
[1:29:13] I've had to lay on him I've had to I've
[1:29:15] had to lay on him I've had to talk to
[1:29:17] him I've had to have personal
[1:29:18] conversations with
[1:29:20] him I've had to I've had to have one of
[1:29:23] those walks with him God I'm not able to
[1:29:25] do this God I'm not able to overcome God
[1:29:27] I'm not able but when I lay my head upon
[1:29:31] the bosom of el High I find it's not by
[1:29:34] might and it's not by
[1:29:37] power but by my spirit sayth the
[1:29:50] Lord Abraham
[1:29:54] I know it looks like it's
[1:29:57] impossible but the one that is at your
[1:29:59] tent
[1:30:01] door he's the one you've been pulling
[1:30:05] on he's the strength he's the strength
[1:30:09] he says I am El sh and you are the leak
[1:30:12] weak little baby but lean up my bosom my
[1:30:15] promise and nurse for me your strength I
[1:30:18] am the creator of heavens and earth but
[1:30:21] the stars out of and put the stars out
[1:30:24] wonder is anything too great for God I
[1:30:27] am El Shad you are my child though you
[1:30:30] are weak I'm letting you get that way
[1:30:33] just to see what you'll do about
[1:30:43] it I'm letting you get that way just to
[1:30:46] see what you're going to do about it
[1:30:48] brother
[1:30:52] Joel I'm going to make an example for
[1:30:55] people Hereafter that that man will
[1:30:58] believe my word I'll stand by my word no
[1:31:02] matter what it takes how long I'll do it
[1:31:04] I'll stand by El sh draw your strength
[1:31:08] from me you're not my favorite preacher
[1:31:11] brother Andrew who
[1:31:13] cares it's who I
[1:31:17] represent I stand here in the stead of
[1:31:22] elhad and you don't understand what's
[1:31:24] going on right now but if you could draw
[1:31:27] your strength from the word of
[1:31:35] God you'll find out he's still El sh
[1:31:39] you'll find out he's still the breasted
[1:31:40] God you'll find out he's still new in
[1:31:42] Old Testament just draw your strength
[1:31:44] from it oh everything that you have need
[1:31:46] of the baby he is helpless he has to
[1:31:49] pull his strength from his mother that's
[1:31:51] the only way that he can get his
[1:31:52] strength that's the only way that a
[1:31:53] belie can get a strength is to pull it
[1:31:56] from the word of God that's his strength
[1:31:59] God's promises to him God stands by his
[1:32:06] word there is no insufficiencies in
[1:32:10] God it doesn't matter how far you've ran
[1:32:13] it doesn't matter how far you gone there
[1:32:15] is no insufficiencies of God it doesn't
[1:32:17] matter if you've criticized it I got a
[1:32:20] quote here to back up what I'm saying it
[1:32:21] doesn't matter if you've criticized it
[1:32:23] itn't matter of your condition God is
[1:32:26] elshad he is the breasted God that he is
[1:32:29] a life sustainer and he is a satisfier
[1:32:32] of Life brother Brandon was dealing with
[1:32:34] a patient one time he's dealing with a
[1:32:35] brother and he's dealing with him in
[1:32:37] sickness in his body he said there's a
[1:32:39] Warfare between your elet and between
[1:32:42] the spirit he said you see he said but
[1:32:44] if your spirit can come up to believe
[1:32:46] this so notice what that Elman had done
[1:32:49] it had depressed his
[1:32:51] Spirit but what did he do what was
[1:32:54] William brandham doing he was calling
[1:32:56] for that man's Spirit to come up here to
[1:32:58] believe it what does the preaching of
[1:33:00] the word do it calls for you to let your
[1:33:03] faith loose and let your spirit fly into
[1:33:05] a realm that maybe it seems
[1:33:08] incompass he said oh if your spirit can
[1:33:11] come up here to believe this God will
[1:33:13] bless you and you'll get well he said
[1:33:15] you're a Believer CU I believe that all
[1:33:17] my heart yes sir you haven't always been
[1:33:20] a Believer
[1:33:21] though you've been a Critic
[1:33:24] you criticized this haven't you isn't
[1:33:26] that right yes sir you criticized
[1:33:29] it I
[1:33:31] believe it was probably my meeting I see
[1:33:35] you shaking your
[1:33:40] head is he still Hebrews
[1:33:44] 4:12 I see you shaking your
[1:33:47] head but if you go to listening the
[1:33:50] brother turns and ask for forgiveness
[1:33:54] thank you he asked for forgiveness and
[1:33:57] the prophet said looks into that world
[1:33:59] you're forgiven my brother so you see
[1:34:02] you see the spirit of God was sufficient
[1:34:05] enough to heal him and he was sufficient
[1:34:07] enough to forgive him it doesn't matter
[1:34:10] if you sit in the seat of the scornful
[1:34:11] it doesn't matter where you've been
[1:34:12] sitting at my God is sufficient enough
[1:34:16] to satisfy every portion of your life
[1:34:19] and what did Abram do he nursed a new
[1:34:23] body
[1:34:24] out of elhad ey to produce the promise
[1:34:27] of Isaac what did that woman down there
[1:34:29] in Mexico that come walking through the
[1:34:32] water had a dead baby in her arms what
[1:34:34] did she do she nursed on El shad's
[1:34:38] breast and pulled aive baby right back
[1:34:41] out of
[1:34:43] it hallelujah what did Congressman
[1:34:46] Upshaw do he laid out there 66 years in
[1:34:49] the same condition but eladia was enough
[1:34:53] for congressman
[1:34:54] Upshaw and he pulled a new life out of
[1:34:57] it blind barus had sat there all them
[1:35:01] years but one
[1:35:04] day Jesus had walked that way before and
[1:35:06] he knew that he was sitting there he
[1:35:08] knew blind marus was sitting there but
[1:35:11] when he walked by there this time he
[1:35:13] wasn't going to leave it for his
[1:35:14] brothers his disciples to come in the
[1:35:16] book of Acts and do it but he was going
[1:35:18] to do the
[1:35:19] work what did he do he recognized that
[1:35:22] that was the same one that Joshua had
[1:35:24] talked to down there at the Gate of
[1:35:26] Jericho
[1:35:29] at and he pulled
[1:35:32] eyesight out of
[1:35:37] Jehovah what about Florence n andil
[1:35:44] sherle they paid for a ticket for
[1:35:46] William Brandon to come and pray for
[1:35:50] her but because of circumstances William
[1:35:52] brandham couldn't get to to
[1:35:54] her all the way over there from Duran
[1:35:57] South
[1:35:58] Africa super tall
[1:36:01] lady but cancer had got in her stomach
[1:36:04] so
[1:36:05] much that she was such a thin thing
[1:36:07] brother brand said when he saw her he
[1:36:09] said I don't even know how that she had
[1:36:11] the ability to produce
[1:36:14] tears said there wasn't even enough
[1:36:16] there wasn't even enough blood in her
[1:36:18] veins to be able to take blood
[1:36:21] from and when he met her in London at
[1:36:24] the airport they said she's here for
[1:36:26] this come pray for me but she wasn't
[1:36:28] praying for healing she was praying for
[1:36:29] him to die for her to die she had lived
[1:36:33] in such a wicked state of life being
[1:36:35] under the pressures of
[1:36:37] it you get to a spot sometimes you you
[1:36:40] you know that death is a friend and she
[1:36:43] was praying but brother Bram said when I
[1:36:45] went down there he said I went to pray
[1:36:47] for her and he said I wasn't praying for
[1:36:50] her to die he said I didn't know he said
[1:36:53] I didn't have no anointing on me he said
[1:36:54] I didn't know what was going to happen
[1:36:56] he said but while I was sitting there
[1:36:57] praying for her the dove of the Holy
[1:36:59] Ghost come and landed on that wiow se
[1:37:01] window seal and while he was praying
[1:37:03] that Dove CED back and forth and
[1:37:05] Vindicated what the healing was getting
[1:37:07] ready to take place what was this
[1:37:09] Florence what was she doing she was
[1:37:11] nursing from a body that was so sick
[1:37:15] that was incapable of being made whole
[1:37:18] what did she do she nursed the very
[1:37:20] strength out of eladia's life so what am
[1:37:24] I saying to you that the Lord our God is
[1:37:27] your shield and he is your buckler he is
[1:37:30] your
[1:37:31] portion he is your portion there is no
[1:37:34] more roaming there is no more wandering
[1:37:36] this is your land of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:38] Joshua little bride this is your portion
[1:37:42] this is your manifestation this is your
[1:37:44] Vindication this is your
[1:37:46] land that's why the Bible would say in
[1:37:48] Isaiah 54 that no weapon that is formed
[1:37:51] against you shall prosper and tongue
[1:37:53] that shall rise against thee in judgment
[1:37:55] Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage
[1:37:58] of the Servants of the Lord and the
[1:38:00] righteousnesses of me sayith the Lord so
[1:38:03] every weapon that is
[1:38:05] destined against you is destined to be
[1:38:07] destroyed he's the one that created the
[1:38:10] waser to destroy but he's got the power
[1:38:12] to protect you when the weapon that is
[1:38:15] formed against you comes against
[1:38:17] you and he said every tongue that rises
[1:38:20] against you
[1:38:24] Hannah every mocker every mocker Thou
[1:38:29] shalt condemn Abraham God has called you
[1:38:32] a father a a father of many
[1:38:34] nations let them mock you all they want
[1:38:37] to but every tongue that rises against
[1:38:40] you Thou shalt condemn the tongue that
[1:38:43] rises against you words have the ability
[1:38:46] to really slander against you words have
[1:38:49] the ability to hurt you
[1:38:53] the person who said sticks and stones
[1:38:55] may break my bones but words may never
[1:38:56] heard me never had real friends stab
[1:38:58] them in the
[1:39:01] back but let me put it to you like
[1:39:03] Spurgeon said it that the slander that
[1:39:05] strikes you you shall condemn it the
[1:39:08] more accusers the more acles the more
[1:39:11] slander the more honor the so the enemy
[1:39:14] May slander as much as much as he
[1:39:17] pleases but you're going to be there to
[1:39:19] condemn the slandering
[1:39:23] when the enemy says you ain't going to
[1:39:25] make it rise up and condemn it when he
[1:39:27] says you're not going to make the
[1:39:29] Rapture rise up and condemn it but
[1:39:31] notice this ain't just for any
[1:39:33] churchgoer this is for the heritage of
[1:39:36] the Servants of the Lord so this
[1:39:40] scripture is not just for the
[1:39:42] trinitarianism this is not just for the
[1:39:44] Baptist this is for God's portion God's
[1:39:47] elect God's qualified God's
[1:39:51] predestinated let me tell you this ain't
[1:39:53] a church this ain't a church scripture
[1:39:56] this is a bride
[1:40:01] scripture yeah somebody hold me down
[1:40:03] give me some ratchet straps I'm about to
[1:40:04] rock it out of this place this ain't
[1:40:06] just for anybody this ain't just for the
[1:40:08] pope this ain't just for Billy
[1:40:11] Graham when you see Billy Graham and you
[1:40:13] see orl Roberts and you see those great
[1:40:16] men tying into these scrap these
[1:40:18] scriptures and getting the blessings off
[1:40:20] of it what are they doing they're tying
[1:40:22] themselves in into your promises but the
[1:40:25] promise was not for them it was not for
[1:40:29] Ismael it's for you
[1:40:34] Isaac I am your portion so no weapon if
[1:40:40] it be cancer shall rise against you it

[1:41:16] at let them say what they going to say
[1:41:19] let them say what they going to say let
[1:41:20] them do what they going to do but as for
[1:41:22] me in my house
[1:41:26] I know where I'm at I'm I'm not reaching
[1:41:28] here but every tongue that rises against
[1:41:31] you little bride you have a job to
[1:41:35] do
[1:41:42] now this ain't me this ain't me this
[1:41:46] ain't my doing this ain't some workup of
[1:41:48] some man this ain't some workup of of
[1:41:50] emotions here but this is H this is
[1:41:53] himself this is not Abram this is
[1:41:56] Abraham so Abraham could not do it on
[1:41:59] his own Andrew Spencer could not do it
[1:42:01] on his own Ron Spencer could not do it
[1:42:03] on his own Hallelujah so God had to
[1:42:06] deposit a part of himself on the inside
[1:42:09] of Abraham to show that he was able to
[1:42:13] do it when
[1:42:15] God poured himself
[1:42:19] into Abraham they have laughed at you
[1:42:23] they have mocked you they have talked
[1:42:25] about you they've called you a Holy
[1:42:27] Roller they've called you it's just a
[1:42:28] bunch of workup but I didn't do that
[1:42:32] just so that they could talk about you
[1:42:34] I'd put myself on the inside of you to
[1:42:37] prove that their accusations was
[1:42:41] [Applause]
[1:42:49] false you that were here last night and
[1:42:51] you stood up with you mind standing up
[1:42:58] again these are those that said that
[1:43:01] they would never come back to this
[1:43:02] church they' made a declaration they
[1:43:04] weren't coming back but they wern't
[1:43:07] holding on themselves they weren doing
[1:43:10] it themselves God deposited a part of
[1:43:13] himself on the inside of them men talked
[1:43:15] about them men criticized them their own
[1:43:18] mind condemned them but God rich in
[1:43:22] Mercy
[1:43:27] Satan I want you to take a look keep
[1:43:28] standing Satan you take a look you did
[1:43:32] not have enough power to keep us in the
[1:43:34] prison sell you did not have enough
[1:43:37] power to keep us in our 99 year old body
[1:43:40] but when meel that came to my
[1:43:45] tent blessed be the name of the most
[1:43:47] high
[1:43:49] God Abraham it's not you it's me little
[1:43:54] bride this ain't a workup it's
[1:43:58] [Applause]

[1:44:14] when you can't do this when you try to
[1:44:16] do it through every other thing brother
[1:44:18] brandom said that the new birth is your
[1:44:21] satisfying portion you can not live this
[1:44:23] message without the new
[1:44:35] birth
[1:44:40] hallelujah
[1:44:43] hallelujah
[1:44:49] hallelujah
[1:44:51] hallelujah Abraham he never pulled he
[1:44:54] never Fred he never
[1:44:56] worried he had the word and he laid upon
[1:44:59] El shad's
[1:45:01] breast you're not drinking from a
[1:45:03] fountain that's been froze over you got
[1:45:06] an artisian well that you're drinking
[1:45:09] from this ain't just on Saturday night
[1:45:11] and Sunday morning Hallelujah this ain't
[1:45:14] some painted
[1:45:17] fire this is a fire of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:21] this is the anointing of the mighty
[1:45:23] Angel
[1:45:25] himself
[1:45:28] Hallelujah there is no satisfying
[1:45:31] portion outside of this message there is
[1:45:33] no satisfying portion in the end of a
[1:45:35] bottle there is no satisfying
[1:45:38] portion outside of the new
[1:45:42] birth you ain't serving some dead god
[1:45:44] with he we got a Living God on our side
[1:45:47] I'm not 1900 years ago but the same
[1:45:49] Pillar of Fire that came down at the day
[1:45:51] of Pentecost that led the children of
[1:45:53] Israel that showed up at William bram's
[1:45:56] Ministry and I declare to you by the
[1:45:58] word of the Lord that same Pillar of
[1:46:00] Fire is in this room this
[1:46:04] morning what you cannot do Abraham I
[1:46:07] have
[1:46:13] deposited you can't do it you can't
[1:46:16] Manifest
[1:46:20] this Abram
[1:46:25] you're
[1:46:26] crazy you're a father of
[1:46:30] Nations and you can't even get out a
[1:46:33] Monday morning without being
[1:46:36] tempted that stupid
[1:46:42] devil right right
[1:46:50] right Satan was close
[1:46:53] but he wasn't that
[1:46:55] close sister Sue he was close but he
[1:46:58] wasn't that
[1:47:00] close Satan's only got power as long as
[1:47:03] you believe in his
[1:47:05] lie but when you refuse his lie you
[1:47:07] strip him of his power Satan was close
[1:47:10] and he heard what was promised to
[1:47:11] Abraham so he started mocking and he
[1:47:13] started making fun and he started
[1:47:15] raising up criticism against Abraham but
[1:47:17] it was not enough to stop the promise
[1:47:19] because what God had deposited brother
[1:47:21] Nathan was enough
[1:47:24] Hallelujah out of him would flow rivers
[1:47:27] of living water out of him would come
[1:47:29] Isaac but Isaac was not his Royal seed
[1:47:32] Christ was his Royal seed what did God
[1:47:34] do in the inside of Abraham's body he
[1:47:37] took a hundredy old man in his
[1:47:40] insufficiency and he proved that God was
[1:47:42] the alls sufficient one
[1:47:54] Hallelujah you didn't do this I am the
[1:47:57] great one amongst you
[1:48:02] Abraham
[1:48:04] hallelujah hallelujah you can't do it
[1:48:07] you can't satisfy that Holy thirst with
[1:48:10] nothing less than the God himself living
[1:48:12] on the inside of
[1:48:16] you in the person of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:25] I am your portion I am John 15:7 if you
[1:48:29] abide in me my words abide and you ask
[1:48:31] what you will I am your portion The
[1:48:33] Works that I do shall you do also I am
[1:48:36] your portion Joel 2 and 28 that in the
[1:48:38] last days I will pour out my spirit upon
[1:48:40] All Flesh your sons and daughters shall
[1:48:41] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[1:48:44] and your young men shall see Visions I
[1:48:46] am your portion that you shall lay hands
[1:48:48] on the sick and they shall recover I am
[1:48:51] your portion of Isaiah 281 that with
[1:48:53] stammering lips and an unknown tongue

[1:48:57] portion I can do all things through
[1:48:59] Christ who strengthens me I am your
[1:49:01] portion if God be for me who can be
[1:49:04] against me I am your portion
[1:49:07] Abraham I am your portion I am your
[1:49:11] everything stop relying on the rest of
[1:49:14] the world to get behind you I am behind
[1:49:18] you
[1:49:32] Hallelujah when Hannah couldn't do it
[1:49:35] God said I am your
[1:49:38] portion when Sarah couldn't do
[1:49:42] it he said I am your
[1:49:46] portion Hallelujah
