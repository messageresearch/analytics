[1:06] i was telling about the king
[1:08] george the late king george of england
[1:11] as he
[1:12] come through british columbia and was in
[1:15] vancouver
[1:16] all the schools turned out to see the
[1:19] king
[1:20] and the canadian people wanting to be a
[1:24] royal to their
[1:25] loyal rather to their king they give all
[1:28] the little children
[1:29] a little british flag to stand on the
[1:32] street
[1:33] and when his majesty the king went by
[1:36] that wave
[1:37] these little flags to show that they
[1:39] were behind him
[1:41] and they were his subjects and
[1:45] the teachers turned all the fellows out
[1:48] and after king passed by all the little
[1:51] children in a certain
[1:52] school returned but one little
[1:55] tiny thought of a girl and the teacher
[1:59] was very much
[2:01] upset so she called all the older
[2:04] children and she said
[2:05] what became little martha
[2:09] and they couldn't find her they said
[2:11] well she was in the group of
[2:13] us but they couldn't find her and the
[2:16] teacher
[2:16] hysterically ran into the street and
[2:19] began looking for this certain little
[2:22] girl that did not return
[2:25] and after everybody was gone the streets
[2:28] was cleared following the king
[2:31] saying god save the king and they found
[2:34] this little girl
[2:35] standing behind a telegraph pole with
[2:38] her little head leaned up against her
[2:39] hands
[2:40] just crying her little heart out
[2:43] another teacher picked her up and she
[2:45] said martha honey
[2:48] why are you weeping said did you not get
[2:51] to wave your
[2:52] flag at the king she said yes teacher
[2:56] i i got to wave my flag she said well
[3:00] then did
[3:01] you not get to see the king she said
[3:04] yes teacher i got to see the king
[3:08] she said then why are you weeping so
[3:12] honey
[3:13] and she said you know teacher i saw the
[3:16] king
[3:18] but i was so little he didn't see me
[3:22] that's not so with our king jesus
[3:25] i don't care how little you are how
[3:28] little you do
[3:29] you cannot do the smallest thing without
[3:31] him knowing all about it
[3:33] he knows every little heartache every
[3:36] little pain that you bear
[3:38] every little disappointment you have no
[3:41] matter
[3:41] how little it is he still knows
[3:45] all about it
[3:49] you know our lord he meets and
[3:53] realms a man sometimes he meets a great
[3:56] groups of men sometimes he meets with
[4:00] few we have record of a meeting with 500
[4:03] one time
[4:04] after his resurrection and then we have
[4:07] where he met with the 70 and with
[4:09] the 12 and even with the three
[4:12] and then we have times where he'll meet
[4:15] with just
[4:15] one that's what makes him god to me
[4:19] is because that is humility

[38:18] that were so dear
[38:21] and i lost some battles
[38:25] by walking in fear

[1:02:44] i think andrew sung that song for me
[1:02:46] this morning
[1:02:47] i didn't tell him but i i told connie i
[1:02:51] i said if there was ever a morning that
[1:02:54] i could just kind of just set this one
[1:02:56] out i believe i would set this one out
[1:02:59] it was one of those days to where that
[1:03:01] you're just kind of
[1:03:02] having trouble getting your feet right
[1:03:04] in front of each other so
[1:03:05] so if i kind of stumble along a little
[1:03:07] bit this morning you
[1:03:09] kind of just bear with me and so got a
[1:03:12] little bit of a reason for it but that's
[1:03:13] just how it is
[1:03:15] kind of interesting i'm going to preach
[1:03:17] on overcoming the urge to quit
[1:03:24] amen amen so
[1:03:27] so here we are amen
[1:03:31] i have to i have to step up in this case
[1:03:34] amen we we normally this time of year we
[1:03:39] we gather our little ones that are going
[1:03:42] to go to school
[1:03:43] not just the little ones but everybody
[1:03:45] that's affiliated with school
[1:03:47] we have them to come and stand close and
[1:03:50] and we pray over them and uh
[1:03:54] we'll do it a little bit different this
[1:03:56] year but we want to still do
[1:03:58] it and maybe we'll just have you stand
[1:04:00] in your place where you are
[1:04:02] in just a couple of moments but we're
[1:04:04] living in different times
[1:04:08] i personally believe that we're just
[1:04:10] before the coming of the lord
[1:04:12] there's a lot of camouflage events that
[1:04:14] will go on
[1:04:16] to camouflage our going home and because
[1:04:20] we're we're quite a number of people
[1:04:23] that will take a rapture and yet the
[1:04:25] world won't even notice it
[1:04:30] amen how better to do it with people
[1:04:32] that are
[1:04:33] that are shut in their homes and their
[1:04:36] neighbors don't even hardly care
[1:04:38] and that's kind of the age that we're
[1:04:40] living in and
[1:04:42] we're living in an age to where that the
[1:04:44] world is falling apart
[1:04:46] and it's almost mind-boggling as we're
[1:04:48] watching it fall apart
[1:04:50] and it's in political realms it's in
[1:04:54] uh realms of schools and all kinds of
[1:04:57] ideologies and it's not just in america
[1:05:00] it's all over the world so this is a
[1:05:02] thing that's sweeping all over the world
[1:05:05] and yet we're dealing with a deadly
[1:05:07] storms
[1:05:08] and we're dealing with we're we're
[1:05:11] dealing with
[1:05:12] deadly diseases and you know it's a
[1:05:15] it's a conspiracy till it hits your
[1:05:17] house
[1:05:20] you know you hear you hear a lot of
[1:05:21] rattling going on well it's just a
[1:05:23] conspiracy
[1:05:24] well just as soon as it comes to your
[1:05:26] house it's not a conspiracy no more
[1:05:30] we even have a have a bug going on here
[1:05:33] that's got a lot of cough that's
[1:05:34] involved in it we don't know for sure
[1:05:36] what it is but we're wanting to be very
[1:05:39] cautious with it
[1:05:40] and so uh i don't have it but brother
[1:05:44] joe's sister
[1:05:45] ruth ann has that and several of the
[1:05:47] family there has it
[1:05:49] and and i i want to very much be praying
[1:05:52] for them that god would just
[1:05:54] touch them in a supernatural way and it
[1:05:57] not be coveted
[1:05:58] and that's that's what we're praying for
[1:06:01] amen so many are fighting that disease
[1:06:03] in such a wicked way
[1:06:05] there's a scripture that i want to i
[1:06:07] want to share with you
[1:06:09] and for those of you that's been here
[1:06:12] quite a while you know this is my
[1:06:14] favorite scripture and it's psalms 91.
[1:06:18] and the reason i read psalms 91 is is
[1:06:21] because it is a
[1:06:22] it's a scripture of not just power
[1:06:26] but it's also a scripture of guarding
[1:06:29] for us
[1:06:30] and protecting for us and it's a
[1:06:32] covenant between
[1:06:34] god and and his people and so
[1:06:38] and so i've read it and i i've read it
[1:06:40] almost every day of my life and
[1:06:42] and that's been a real comfort to me
[1:06:44] it's been a real strength to me
[1:06:46] and i had somebody after i said that one
[1:06:49] time and after a service
[1:06:51] somebody came to me and said well you've
[1:06:53] read that scripture
[1:06:55] almost every day of your life and look
[1:06:57] what happened to you
[1:06:58] all those events that happened to you i
[1:07:00] said well what would have i
[1:07:01] went through if i hadn't read it
[1:07:08] you know sometimes you got to look at
[1:07:10] the cup half full instead of that cup
[1:07:12] half empty
[1:07:14] amen i'd like for you to read it with me
[1:07:17] since that
[1:07:18] that uh we'll we'll do this this morning
[1:07:21] and if you can put that up on the screen

[1:07:26] you as an audience
[1:07:27] brother andrew if you'll lead the
[1:07:28] audience in the second verse

[1:07:36] the most high shall abide under the
[1:07:38] shadow of the almighty
[1:07:40] i will save the lord he is my refuge and
[1:07:43] my fortress
[1:07:44] my god and him will i trust surely he
[1:07:47] shall deliver thee from the snare of the
[1:07:49] fowl
[1:07:50] and from the noise and pestilence he
[1:07:53] shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:07:55] and under his wings shalt thou trust his
[1:07:58] troops shall be thy skilled and buckler
[1:08:01] thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
[1:08:03] by night nor of the
[1:08:04] arrow that flieth by day nor for the
[1:08:07] pestilence that walketh in darkness nor
[1:08:10] for the destruction that wasteth at
[1:08:12] noonday
[1:08:13] a thousand shall file at thy side and
[1:08:15] ten thousand at their right hand
[1:08:17] but it shall not come nigh thee only
[1:08:20] with thine eyes shall thou behold and
[1:08:22] see the reward of the wicked
[1:08:25] because thou has made thee the lord
[1:08:28] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:08:31] thy habitation
[1:08:32] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:08:35] shall any plague come now thy dwelling
[1:08:39] for he shall give his angels charge over
[1:08:41] thee
[1:08:42] to keep thee in all thy ways shall bear
[1:08:45] thee up
[1:08:46] in their hands lest thou dash thy foot
[1:08:48] against the stone
[1:08:49] thou shall not doubt shalt tread upon
[1:08:52] the lion and the adder
[1:08:53] and the young lion and the dragon shalt
[1:08:56] thou trample
[1:08:57] under feet as he hath set his love upon
[1:09:00] me

[1:14:29] eagle flying near
[1:14:31] near where the four presidents are
[1:14:34] engraved in rock
[1:14:35] and i almost saw my picture in that
[1:14:39] and so uh oh teddy's right in there and
[1:14:43] so
[1:14:44] and i thought it was so great and and it

[1:14:51] and
[1:14:51] those different animals associated with
[1:14:54] the message

[1:15:38] internet
[1:15:39] and you don't know it sister angela's
[1:15:42] uh her dad's name ronaldine lilly
[1:15:45] and uh and we've been ronald deans
[1:15:47] together for a long long time and
[1:15:50] and she was very close to my mother and
[1:15:52] she actually saw the vision the day that
[1:15:54] i was going to be an
[1:15:56] explosion and she actually made contact
[1:15:58] with my mom
[1:15:59] and then made contact with me i was in
[1:16:02] richmond
[1:16:03] and she told me how are you and i told
[1:16:05] her fine she said well i saw you in an
[1:16:07] explosion
[1:16:08] and so i said no i'm fine i'm i'm very
[1:16:11] fine
[1:16:11] and so that was some 12 years ago
[1:16:15] and god saw to it that somebody was
[1:16:17] praying for me
[1:16:19] and saw it was coming before it actually
[1:16:21] came
[1:16:22] and so she's been a very dear friend of
[1:16:26] our family for a long time
[1:16:27] sister sandy we're so glad to have her
[1:16:30] here with us and she's just one of us
[1:16:32] now and and we don't have a book here
[1:16:35] that says it puts her name on it but
[1:16:37] if we had a book she's right on it

[1:16:43] our hearts and
[1:16:44] and we so appreciate you making them at
[1:16:46] home amen
[1:16:48] amen i'm going to preach a sermon that
[1:16:51] every one of you
[1:16:54] have felt
[1:16:58] every one of you have felt a part of
[1:17:01] this in
[1:17:02] your life i don't know if i've ever
[1:17:05] heard it preached on quite like this but
[1:17:07] i'm going to preach it this morning
[1:17:09] just kind of the way that he's dealt
[1:17:11] with me to preach on
[1:17:12] it if you will turn with me to luke
[1:17:14] chapter 22
[1:17:16] and verse 31 i'd like to
[1:17:19] speak to you on the urge to quit
[1:17:23] now you can be honest and say brother
[1:17:26] ron i've been there done that and got
[1:17:27] that t-shirt
[1:17:30] you can go ahead and say it you yeah
[1:17:34] amen because you're you're in some good
[1:17:36] company so anyone that would be a critic
[1:17:38] i'm going to get you in just a few
[1:17:40] minutes and so
[1:17:44] amen luke chapter 22 and verse 31
[1:17:51] and the lord said simon
[1:17:55] simon lead disciple
[1:18:00] spokesman of the church
[1:18:05] satan hath desired to have you
[1:18:10] that he may sift you as wheat
[1:18:13] but i have prayed for thee that thy
[1:18:16] faith failed not
[1:18:18] and when thou art converted
[1:18:22] strengthen thy brethren and he said unto
[1:18:25] him
[1:18:26] lord i am ready to go with thee both to
[1:18:28] prison
[1:18:29] and to death and this is jesus talking
[1:18:34] and he said i tell thee peter the crop
[1:18:37] the shall not crow this day
[1:18:42] before thou hast thrice denied
[1:18:46] that you know me that's
[1:18:49] quite a powerful reading i want to read
[1:18:53] the lord's prayer before we get too deep
[1:18:55] into this because we need it
[1:18:58] and after this man i pray therefore pray
[1:19:00] ye
[1:19:01] our father which art in heaven
[1:19:04] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:19:09] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:19:12] heaven
[1:19:13] give us this daily bread as and forgive
[1:19:16] us our debts as we forgive our debtors
[1:19:21] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:19:24] deliver us from evil
[1:19:25] for thine is the kingdom the power
[1:19:29] and the glory forever
[1:19:32] amen you may be seated
[1:19:40] jesus would deal with this subject
[1:19:47] and jesus said unto them
[1:19:50] no man having put his hand to the plow
[1:19:54] and looking back
[1:19:57] is fit for the kingdom of god
[1:20:06] quitting
[1:20:10] quitting whatever the reason
[1:20:13] is maybe it's too much pressure
[1:20:18] maybe it's just exhausted
[1:20:21] maybe it's just frustrated maybe it's
[1:20:24] the lack of commitment
[1:20:26] maybe it's just to flee or to run
[1:20:30] shirk responsibility why do i have to
[1:20:33] have all
[1:20:34] the load why am i going through all of
[1:20:37] this
[1:20:39] running away from responsibility
[1:20:43] maybe it's just a refusal to train
[1:20:46] because as a christian you're in
[1:20:48] training
[1:20:50] maybe you want an easier way but god
[1:20:53] didn't design for you an easier way
[1:20:58] maybe it's to escape at all
[1:21:04] maybe it's just i'm playing more out
[1:21:07] sometimes there's a fatigue to where a
[1:21:10] fella don't have to
[1:21:11] want to put a foot in front of the other
[1:21:15] maybe you're just wiped out you've heard
[1:21:18] the statement i'm burnout
[1:21:22] maybe it's because some of the things
[1:21:23] that you went through i thought last
[1:21:25] night's sermon was perfect
[1:21:27] as a prelude to today
[1:21:30] but nobody cares about me nobody loves
[1:21:34] me
[1:21:35] nobody understands me
[1:21:40] have i hit any just so far in the first
[1:21:44] 60 seconds have i hit anybody here
[1:21:50] go ahead let's go ahead and put our
[1:21:51] hands up just for a little bit there
[1:21:52] just for a moment
[1:21:54] yeah i believe i'm preaching to the
[1:21:56] right audience
[1:21:57] you took you took a right at the right
[1:21:59] place sister connie
[1:22:04] nobody cares nobody understands
[1:22:09] now as long as you're a spectator
[1:22:13] as long as you're just watching
[1:22:16] and by association and there's no
[1:22:19] skin in involved
[1:22:22] the devil will leave you okay
[1:22:26] maybe even when you were in sin you you
[1:22:29] thought that you were a spot
[1:22:30] at a spot to wear that you know i'm
[1:22:33] getting along fine
[1:22:34] because the scripture said that sin
[1:22:37] is pleasurable for a season
[1:22:43] i mean some of you didn't look like you
[1:22:45] were in misery and shackles and chains
[1:22:47] and
[1:22:47] everything when you were doing it out in
[1:22:49] the world
[1:22:51] when you thought you was god in your
[1:22:53] life there was literally angels watching
[1:22:55] over you
[1:22:56] to keep you out of the muck and the mire
[1:22:58] a lot of times
[1:23:00] you would have went too far if god
[1:23:01] hadn't been right there with you
[1:23:03] he was watching over you and you were a
[1:23:06] child of god though you didn't know it
[1:23:08] or act like it or
[1:23:10] not
[1:23:13] are you with me and there are times that
[1:23:15] you just like to say well i quit i'm
[1:23:17] going back to the way that i had
[1:23:19] and you were a mess at that spot
[1:23:22] and you want to go back there i don't
[1:23:25] want to have a day without god
[1:23:31] the devil will leave you all right in
[1:23:33] that spot
[1:23:35] but here every one of you'll get
[1:23:37] involved but the very moment
[1:23:40] that you start raising your head and
[1:23:43] saying i'm a christian
[1:23:46] then all hell breaks loose can you say
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:50] right there
[1:23:54] quitting is an urge
[1:23:57] it's an urge every champion has felt it
[1:24:02] i was brother uh gabriel was really
[1:24:05] relating to me this week that some of
[1:24:08] the greatest trainers in the world
[1:24:11] that they begin to train people and
[1:24:13] they're pulling everything that they can
[1:24:15] pull out of people
[1:24:16] when you feel like you can't go another
[1:24:18] step you've only burned
[1:24:20] 70 percent of your energy
[1:24:23] there's still a reserve of 30 percent
[1:24:27] more but you got to break through the
[1:24:29] barrier
[1:24:32] now understand this every prophet has
[1:24:35] felt the urge to quit
[1:24:39] jesus felt the urge to quit
[1:24:43] three times in the garden of gethsemane
[1:24:45] let this cup
[1:24:46] pass from me
[1:24:51] are you with me now no home
[1:24:56] no wife no family
[1:24:59] everybody was a critic around him just a
[1:25:02] small congregation that was with him
[1:25:05] he didn't have an incredible amount of
[1:25:08] people applauding him
[1:25:09] every day and encouraging him every day
[1:25:12] he did not have a pier
[1:25:17] brother branham felt like walking away
[1:25:21] and i might get a lot of critics like
[1:25:23] there but why did he want to go to the
[1:25:25] mountains to stay
[1:25:28] and if god if you've got me to be a
[1:25:30] prophet i'll come down out of the
[1:25:32] mountains say the word of the lord
[1:25:33] and then go back up in the mountains
[1:25:39] pressures of life had put him in a spot
[1:25:44] until he wanted to go to the mountains
[1:25:46] to where he was alone
[1:25:49] but god had to personally tell him
[1:25:52] if you go up there i'll leave you your
[1:25:55] wife will leave you your children will
[1:25:57] leave you
[1:26:02] come on just god's saying i'll leave
[1:26:07] is enough
[1:26:10] every president has felt like quitting
[1:26:17] you know our one of our greatest
[1:26:19] presidents
[1:26:21] was abraham lincoln
[1:26:24] he suffered defeat in 11 different
[1:26:28] elections you would think at a spot he
[1:26:32] would say okay i've had enough
[1:26:34] okay i've had enough okay i've had
[1:26:36] enough but something was driving him
[1:26:40] now his personal family he and his
[1:26:43] wife's relationship
[1:26:45] was shipwrecked
[1:26:50] sermon is not about abraham lincoln and
[1:26:52] neither is it about marriage
[1:26:55] but the reason that he was constantly a
[1:26:57] traveler he loved to travel and
[1:27:00] talk to people loved to give speeches he
[1:27:03] worked for the railroad as a lawyer
[1:27:05] and they were pushing him to become the
[1:27:07] president of the united states of
[1:27:09] america
[1:27:10] and he said one of his greatest
[1:27:11] disappointments was he had to live with
[1:27:13] his wife in the same house
[1:27:22] every king has felt like quitting
[1:27:26] even the very lion l-i-o-n
[1:27:32] the king of the jungle will sometimes
[1:27:35] begin to show that he feels like
[1:27:39] quitting
[1:27:43] every winner has felt like quitting
[1:27:48] every soldier has felt like quitting
[1:27:52] every victorious person has felt like
[1:27:57] i just feel like quitting
[1:28:02] now quitting will cause you to not
[1:28:05] finish
[1:28:10] throwing up your hands and quitting and
[1:28:12] saying
[1:28:14] i i i just don't want to i just don't
[1:28:16] want to go on anymore
[1:28:19] there was a boxer that became famous
[1:28:22] for saying no mas nomas
[1:28:26] he had a spectacular career
[1:28:29] but he is known for the fight to wear
[1:28:33] that he said
[1:28:34] i don't want no more he had been whipped
[1:28:37] to the point
[1:28:38] to where that he he couldn't handle no
[1:28:41] more didn't want to be hit again in his
[1:28:43] life
[1:28:44] at that point my understanding he had
[1:28:47] won 72 fights
[1:28:49] and held many championships but he is
[1:28:52] known for
[1:28:53] i quit i don't want that to be mine in
[1:28:57] your
[1:29:03] i don't want to run this race for 30 to
[1:29:05] 40 years and because of a trial
[1:29:08] to come to a spot to say i quit
[1:29:12] i give up
[1:29:16] i was speaking to a minister this week
[1:29:18] and he was asking me if i was going to
[1:29:20] speak this weekend i
[1:29:21] i told him what the lord was dealing
[1:29:23] with me he said brother ron
[1:29:25] you of all people could speak to this
[1:29:29] subject
[1:29:30] because you've been in spots over the
[1:29:32] last months
[1:29:34] that the public don't
[1:29:37] and i told him this i said let me just
[1:29:39] say i understand why cancer patients
[1:29:43] going chemo or immunotherapy or just

[1:30:44] wife i

[1:31:45] but i want to say to you i made it this
[1:31:56] morning
[1:32:00] the scripture that continues to come to
[1:32:02] our hearts is
[1:32:03] no weapon that is formed against us
[1:32:04] shall prosper
[1:32:08] philippians says it like this being
[1:32:10] confident of this very thing that he
[1:32:12] which had begun
[1:32:13] a good work in us
[1:32:18] will perform it until the day of jesus
[1:32:20] christ
[1:32:22] god's what he started he's not going to
[1:32:24] quit
[1:32:27] the scripture says i can do all things
[1:32:32] through christ which strengthens me
[1:32:38] hallelujah finally my brethren paul
[1:32:41] writes this from prison finally my
[1:32:43] brethren be strong in the lord
[1:32:45] and in the power of his might and put on
[1:32:49] the whole armor of god that you may be
[1:32:50] able to stand
[1:32:52] against the wiles of the devil for we
[1:32:54] wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:32:57] but against principalities and against
[1:32:59] powers and against the rulers of the
[1:33:01] darkness of this world
[1:33:03] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:33:06] places
[1:33:09] jude 1 24 says it like this
[1:33:13] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:33:15] from falling
[1:33:21] hallelujah i'll be up there
[1:33:26] unto him that is able to keep you from
[1:33:28] falling
[1:33:30] and to present you faultless
[1:33:33] before the presence of his glory
[1:33:37] with excellent exceedingly
[1:33:40] joy i want you to read that with me if
[1:33:43] you can
[1:33:44] now unto him that is able to keep you
[1:33:47] from
[1:33:47] falling do you believe that
[1:33:57] so it's not you that's hanging on
[1:34:05] so many people say well i'm just having
[1:34:06] a tough time being a christian
[1:34:08] really well you've left the wrong man be
[1:34:11] leading you
[1:34:14] oh brother ron it's just so hard to be a
[1:34:16] christian really
[1:34:17] if you really get born again and you
[1:34:19] realize this scripture right here
[1:34:22] you are not the one
[1:34:26] that is holding on it is him
[1:34:29] through you
[1:34:36] since i've become a christian i've never
[1:34:37] had to have rehab
[1:34:41] i've never looked back
[1:34:47] i was a raggedy old boy but i've never
[1:34:50] looked back
[1:34:53] i've never went back and had to tamper
[1:34:55] with none of those things
[1:34:57] god has kept me
[1:35:02] well brother ron i followed that's
[1:35:04] because you took your hands out of
[1:35:06] jesus's hands
[1:35:09] and you fail don't blame it on god
[1:35:16] boy this good this is really good
[1:35:20] my brethren james chapter 1 verse 2
[1:35:24] my brethren counted all joy when you
[1:35:26] fall into diver's temptation
[1:35:29] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:35:31] faith worketh patience
[1:35:33] but let patience have her perfect work
[1:35:36] that you may be
[1:35:37] perfect and and in
[1:35:40] an entire nothing
[1:35:44] warning nothing
[1:35:48] james 1 12 blessed is the man that
[1:35:50] endureth temptation
[1:35:52] for when he has tried he shall receive
[1:35:54] the crown of life
[1:35:56] and the lord who hath promised
[1:36:00] to to them that love him let no man say
[1:36:03] when he is tempted i am tempted of god
[1:36:06] for god cannot be tempted with evil
[1:36:09] neither triumph he
[1:36:10] any man but every man is when he's
[1:36:13] tempted
[1:36:14] when he is drawn away in his own lust
[1:36:17] and enticed then when lust hath
[1:36:21] conceived it bringeth forth sin
[1:36:24] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[1:36:26] forth death
[1:36:28] i do i don't have this quote in front of
[1:36:30] me but brother branham said
[1:36:32] said said women sometimes don't like to
[1:36:35] hear
[1:36:36] hear the the dress preached on
[1:36:40] but the moment they make a decision to
[1:36:42] go a whirlier way he said they send
[1:36:45] their self down a road
[1:36:48] and that road has bad consequences to it
[1:36:52] let me just say this to you you choose
[1:36:53] your path in your life
[1:36:57] and you may be headed down that road i
[1:36:59] don't know where you're at but you may
[1:37:01] be headed down that road but you don't
[1:37:02] have to continue to go there
[1:37:04] turn around
[1:37:07] [Applause]
[1:37:12] swallow your your pride
[1:37:15] don't make your own pride take you to
[1:37:17] hell don't make peer pressure take you
[1:37:20] to hell
[1:37:23] oh but brother ron this is such a good
[1:37:25] friend and if it's taking you away from
[1:37:27] god
[1:37:29] i don't care if it's husband wife i
[1:37:32] don't care if it's affiliate
[1:37:33] in life or business partner if you're
[1:37:36] they're taking you away from god in life
[1:37:39] they're not your friend
[1:37:45] they're not your friend
[1:37:48] they're only an advocate for the devil
[1:37:51] to pull you away from god
[1:37:53] and they're taking you in a wrong
[1:38:00] direction
[1:38:05] i want that to settle in because
[1:38:07] sometimes we have to make
[1:38:09] some really difficult choices
[1:38:14] and in those choices we have to come to
[1:38:16] a spot to where that we
[1:38:18] have to look at them and say
[1:38:22] we can't walk the same road
[1:38:28] together
[1:38:32] i'll know you as a business partner and
[1:38:35] i'll know you as an associate
[1:38:36] friend but we can't be muslim friends
[1:38:40] and we can't have allies that's going to
[1:38:42] take us into eternity
[1:38:44] i can't let you make me drowned
[1:38:50] but brother ron i feel like that's my
[1:38:52] brother or i'm saying this for somebody
[1:38:53] i don't know who it is but
[1:38:55] it's landed but i'm saying this
[1:38:58] sometimes you have to make
[1:38:59] a an eternal arrangement and you have to
[1:39:02] look at it and say
[1:39:04] hey i'm headed in the wrong direction
[1:39:07] and i can't carry you
[1:39:15] abraham had to look at lot and say let
[1:39:18] there be no
[1:39:19] strife but if you choose to go that way
[1:39:22] i'm going this way
[1:39:24] if you choose to go this way i'm going
[1:39:26] that way
[1:39:27] now god had told him he had to do it and
[1:39:30] god
[1:39:31] allowed lot to make the choice
[1:39:37] you've heard this all across this
[1:39:39] audience
[1:39:40] before you ever came to church the road
[1:39:43] to hell was paved
[1:39:47] with good intentions
[1:39:50] if the people that had told me that they
[1:39:52] would be in this church
[1:39:54] that they want to come they want to come
[1:39:57] they're going to be here i'm making a
[1:39:58] promise i'm going to be in church
[1:40:00] if they would come and be every
[1:40:04] weekend people we would need a cathedral
[1:40:07] to the road
[1:40:16] but it's a scriptural deal
[1:40:20] 500 people jesus asked to go to the
[1:40:22] upper room
[1:40:27] i don't know how you miss it 380 people
[1:40:33] two-thirds almost decided they had
[1:40:36] something better to do
[1:40:38] than go to the upper room
[1:40:42] they watched the ascension of jesus
[1:40:50] they watched jesus lift up
[1:40:54] into the heavens an angel spoke back to
[1:40:58] them
[1:40:59] given them instructions go to the upper
[1:41:01] room
[1:41:02] because you need the holy ghost in your
[1:41:04] life
[1:41:06] jesus had just explained to them acts
[1:41:08] chapter 1
[1:41:10] you have to have the holy ghost i'm
[1:41:13] leaving
[1:41:13] i'm going to send you a comforter i'm
[1:41:16] going to come and live inside of you
[1:41:18] you're going to be the temple that i'm
[1:41:20] going to live in
[1:41:22] 380 people said i quit
[1:41:30] i don't know how long those people we
[1:41:32] don't have a book of them
[1:41:34] do you know what those people are never
[1:41:36] mentioned again in the scriptures
[1:41:41] sometimes when people walk away from you
[1:41:43] they they think they destroy your world
[1:41:47] really they was nothing but an anchor on
[1:41:49] you
[1:41:50] now your boat can go on
[1:41:56] come on they were a spiritual drain on
[1:41:58] you
[1:42:00] are you with me i'm going to say it like
[1:42:01] it is
[1:42:03] you may have friends in your world
[1:42:06] that are nothing but a spiritual drain
[1:42:08] on you and they drain you of your
[1:42:10] prayers
[1:42:11] they drain you of your spiritual energy
[1:42:14] but if you could only have the fortitude
[1:42:16] this morning say
[1:42:17] i quit carrying you
[1:42:22] there's going to be some things that
[1:42:24] we're going to quit this morning
[1:42:26] i'm gonna quit supporting the devil i'm
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:40] gonna
[1:42:44] i'm not going to call a name it wasn't
[1:42:46] here but
[1:42:47] somebody on the internet might know
[1:42:53] i was praying for somebody on their
[1:42:54] dying bed
[1:42:57] and their concern was for their children
[1:43:02] that had never connected in life
[1:43:06] they were not mentally afflicted
[1:43:10] they were physically okay they
[1:43:14] just never started in life
[1:43:21] these individuals are 30 some years old
[1:43:24] and they were literal
[1:43:25] bums i'm gonna say it like i
[1:43:29] i took that pill this morning
[1:43:34] just literal bums in life they had never
[1:43:37] decided to take life for real this
[1:43:40] let me just say this to you while i'm
[1:43:42] here every one of us have the same 24
[1:43:50] hours
[1:43:52] every one of us have the same 24 hours
[1:43:55] what you do with your 24 hours is that
[1:43:57] totally up to you
[1:44:00] but donald trump does not have 24 hours
[1:44:03] 10 minutes
[1:44:05] only got 24 hours
[1:44:08] what he has made out of his life is
[1:44:11] because of
[1:44:12] grit determination attitude
[1:44:15] whatever he's probably crazy because
[1:44:18] he's doing what he can doing
[1:44:19] i would probably go and if i owned all
[1:44:22] of the golf courses
[1:44:23] i would be on a golf cart every day i
[1:44:26] wouldn't have the media screaming in my
[1:44:28] ear
[1:44:29] he's got more money than he can stand
[1:44:33] but i'm glad he's supporting the parts
[1:44:37] i'm glad he's doing that
[1:44:43] he called all of his men in a few few
[1:44:46] days ago whether you read this or not
[1:44:49] and he just told them around him they
[1:44:51] set the oval office full
[1:44:53] and he said okay what if i just quit
[1:44:58] what if i just walk out of this office
[1:45:00] and say i don't need this job anymore
[1:45:05] what if i just walk away
[1:45:11] is any of you prepared to take my place
[1:45:14] what if i said i've had enough
[1:45:17] of the media and my critics
[1:45:21] what if i said i quit it's a legitimate
[1:45:24] question
[1:45:28] now if he does it tomorrow don't you
[1:45:30] call me a prophet now i'm just
[1:45:32] i'm just
[1:45:37] you know sometimes we almost do that
[1:45:40] brother ron you're so far off your ark
[1:45:42] or you don't know who you are
[1:45:45] okay well ezekiel told god this
[1:45:51] he said god the sermons that you're
[1:45:54] given to me
[1:45:57] are a reproach to me
[1:46:02] my own people hate me
[1:46:06] for preaching they don't want to hear
[1:46:10] what i've got to say you can hear
[1:46:13] brother abraham say these same words
[1:46:16] the more i come back and preach to you
[1:46:18] the more bob heard women than i see
[1:46:21] the you know and he would preach to
[1:46:24] audiences and they didn't want to hear
[1:46:26] it in one place they literally lit up
[1:46:28] their cigarettes and
[1:46:30] and set back there with disrespect
[1:46:33] one particular one the masterpiece
[1:46:35] sermons
[1:46:36] is is the people that were taking care
[1:46:39] of the the
[1:46:40] banquet they just started taking up the
[1:46:42] plates right while he was preaching
[1:46:44] you know our deacons would be all over
[1:46:47] that
[1:46:49] our deacons would be flipping out
[1:46:53] if somebody started going through the
[1:46:55] rows and started cleaning and
[1:46:57] you know and
[1:47:03] hey a baby can scream 10 seconds too
[1:47:05] long and
[1:47:06] nurse people all over the audience going
[1:47:08] i don't want to take it baby out so much
[1:47:09] so check out my
[1:47:13] don't bother me but
[1:47:26] i would say samson felt like this at a
[1:47:27] grind grinding meal
[1:47:30] when little children parents would bring
[1:47:33] little children
[1:47:34] to spit across the mill and spit down on
[1:47:37] the champion
[1:47:38] of israel and they'd spit on him and
[1:47:40] they'd bring him there
[1:47:41] and they'd spit on him history tells us
[1:47:44] that they would bring their little
[1:47:45] children or
[1:47:46] raise their little children up and
[1:47:47] they'd spit on that man
[1:47:49] that's now blind i'd say
[1:47:53] there's days that he really regretted
[1:47:57] the sin that had brought him to this
[1:47:58] condition
[1:48:01] without the new birth let me just say
[1:48:03] this to you without the new birth you'll
[1:48:05] be hounded
[1:48:08] by the sins that you've got in in an
[1:48:10] amazing the devil can talk you into
[1:48:12] doing a lot of things
[1:48:14] and then persecute you and haunt you
[1:48:18] and those things destroy your health
[1:48:24] listen there's no peace at the bottle of
[1:48:27] a beer
[1:48:30] there's no peace at the bottom of a
[1:48:32] liquor joint
[1:48:33] there's no peace with another woman
[1:48:37] or another man they all got the same
[1:48:40] equipment let me just say it like that
[1:48:45] lest it's conceived it brings forth sin
[1:48:47] but it'll destroy your life
[1:48:50] it'll destroy your marriage it'll
[1:48:53] destroy your relationships with your
[1:48:55] children but at the moment
[1:49:00] you feel the urge to quit and give up
[1:49:15] elijah climbed up in a cave
[1:49:18] elijah climbed under a juniper tree
[1:49:21] moses walked into a desert for 40 years
[1:49:28] ezekiel told god said i just quit
[1:49:32] but you hear we sing the song it was
[1:49:35] like a fire shut up in his bones
[1:49:39] after a while you decide i'm going to
[1:49:41] quit well sermons ain't going to quit
[1:49:43] coming to you
[1:49:47] i quit i'm just going to sit down
[1:49:49] sermons ain't going to quit coming
[1:49:51] and so after a while he couldn't just
[1:49:53] preach to himself
[1:49:55] okay i'm gonna have to go and preach
[1:50:08] there was a man named jimmy valvano and
[1:50:10] i i can't do it justice
[1:50:16] but brain cancer had got into his life
[1:50:20] and it was destroying him and he was
[1:50:24] encouraging
[1:50:26] he was encouraging the monies to come to
[1:50:29] research
[1:50:31] that would help somebody in the future
[1:50:37] and he was saying this and it became a a
[1:50:40] statement to the world i think the espys
[1:50:42] or whatever that thing is that they do
[1:50:45] they they they they use his last
[1:50:48] statement
[1:50:49] never give up don't you never give up
[1:50:51] don't you never give up
[1:50:54] and he never gave up but brain cancer
[1:50:56] took him
[1:51:00] and i'm sorry but i've watched that
[1:51:03] speech a few times this year
[1:51:07] because there's some days that you need
[1:51:09] the inspiration
[1:51:13] you need a kick in the seat of your
[1:51:15] pants
[1:51:17] to help you to get off the couch or help
[1:51:19] you to get up
[1:51:20] and i've listened to every book and
[1:51:22] every tape and every scripture and i've
[1:51:24] listened to every great quote that i can
[1:51:26] get a hold of
[1:51:27] to be an inspiration that i can grab a
[1:51:31] hold of
[1:51:32] more than just this 200 pound frame that
[1:51:35] feels like it can't get
[1:51:37] past because there's times
[1:51:40] you're so weary in your body you don't
[1:51:43] feel like
[1:51:44] studying you don't feel like
[1:51:48] singing a glory a g for a gleeful song
[1:51:51] you just feel like that you don't have
[1:51:54] energy
[1:51:54] to move past and my amen and right here
[1:51:57] brother andrew
[1:51:59] i'm just going to share some things
[1:52:00] maybe it'll be a help to somebody
[1:52:02] else
[1:52:05] but whatever you do don't quit
[1:52:19] i'm going to be honest with you i have
[1:52:21] preached sermons in my past life
[1:52:23] that i really didn't understand but i
[1:52:26] have preached sermons like
[1:52:27] take it back and i have personally
[1:52:30] i don't like to listen to myself preach
[1:52:33] but i've listened to them for
[1:52:35] inspiration over and over and over again
[1:52:38] and heard my former self tell my sick
[1:52:42] self
[1:52:43] take it back your health is in front of
[1:52:46] you
[1:52:47] take it back
[1:52:49] [Applause]
[1:52:55] even before the battle came i was
[1:52:57] preaching sermon like courage
[1:53:00] encouragement i've had to go back and
[1:53:02] listen to that sermon
[1:53:04] to preach to me because
[1:53:07] god was speaking to me in a prophetic
[1:53:10] form
[1:53:11] i'm going to have to go through this
[1:53:13] trial
[1:53:19] you've heard me read these scriptures
[1:53:20] and and maybe i can
[1:53:22] maybe i can just finish with these
[1:53:24] scriptures or to be all right if i
[1:53:25] finish
[1:53:26] maybe this sermon next week
[1:53:31] and you've heard these scriptures a
[1:53:33] thousand times
[1:53:40] i wasn't talking about your baby
[1:53:48] silas you're going to live
[1:53:52] i think
[1:53:59] sister judy i can hear her thinking why
[1:54:02] did my baby have to cry first
[1:54:16] are you ready are you ready
[1:54:21] brother on you should be serious really
[1:54:24] laughter is good medicine

[1:54:29] good laugh
[1:54:34] can i share something with you that's
[1:54:36] just been a kind of a neat deal
[1:54:42] maybe this will help somebody
[1:54:47] i'll take my glasses off so i can't see
[1:54:49] you
[1:54:53] probably my most difficult day
[1:54:56] this is my most difficult day that i can
[1:54:58] remember
[1:55:00] and put them back on i get dizzy
[1:55:03] my most difficult day i think that i i
[1:55:05] went through was a
[1:55:07] was a gamma knife radiation there was
[1:55:10] other days that was
[1:55:11] very wicked but
[1:55:15] i'd been in the hospital for
[1:55:18] for almost two weeks and i'd had the
[1:55:22] brain surgery the week before
[1:55:25] and i went home and then i was right
[1:55:26] back in the hospital and
[1:55:31] and and so they had
[1:55:35] i was having a difficult day as it was
[1:55:36] i'd had a really difficult night
[1:55:40] and so they
[1:55:43] they took me down and they told me said
[1:55:46] now we're going to do a surgery before
[1:55:48] we take you to the gamma knife
[1:55:51] and we're going to put a we're going to
[1:55:53] put steel on your head
[1:55:55] that will hold your head perfectly still
[1:55:58] in the mri machine they're using it
[1:56:00] something like an mri eye machine and
[1:56:03] they put you in a tunnel
[1:56:05] and they and your your brain your brain
[1:56:08] has to be 100
[1:56:09] steel and to get it still they use
[1:56:11] stainless steel
[1:56:13] screws about that long and they're
[1:56:16] pretty good size they're pretty large
[1:56:18] and they actually drill them into your
[1:56:20] skull
[1:56:22] you know the scripture says that it says
[1:56:25] that he will not put more on you than
[1:56:27] what
[1:56:29] you can handle how many knows that
[1:56:30] scripture
[1:56:33] but you will be surprised
[1:56:37] what you can live through
[1:56:42] and so you know they took me in and
[1:56:46] everybody was so great to me and they
[1:56:49] were talking to me and
[1:56:50] and the lady at the end of the bed she
[1:56:52] was telling me everything that they were
[1:56:54] going to do and
[1:56:55] doctors were getting ready their whole
[1:56:57] procedure of that was going to take
[1:56:59] about 10 minutes
[1:57:00] and she and she was actually from from
[1:57:04] from pilot virginia she was a nurse and
[1:57:07] she began to talk to me where
[1:57:08] where's your dad's farm and we just
[1:57:10] started talking backwards and forwards
[1:57:12] and all of a sudden she said good night
[1:57:17] and when i woke up i've never been in
[1:57:20] that much pain in my life
[1:57:22] in two minutes they bore
[1:57:26] eight holes in my head
[1:57:30] and put a contraption on me and it was
[1:57:33] all under pressure
[1:57:34] and the reason that i had such a hard
[1:57:36] time and maybe you wouldn't have to
[1:57:38] have that hard time is i just had brain
[1:57:40] surgery
[1:57:43] and they needed to get this surgery done
[1:57:46] quick enough that it might save my life
[1:57:51] and they felt like this was a
[1:57:53] life-saving
[1:57:55] procedure but i've never been in this
[1:57:59] kind of pain
[1:58:00] i've been in a lot of pain i've had my
[1:58:02] back broke i've been hit by lightning
[1:58:05] i've been bit i've had strokes
[1:58:08] i've had different things in my life but
[1:58:10] i've never been to nothing like this
[1:58:11] never been in this kind of pain never
[1:58:15] never never never never never
[1:58:19] and so now they're put they're they're
[1:58:21] taking me to the next
[1:58:22] pushing me down the halls and taking me
[1:58:26] to the next place to where i'm going to
[1:58:27] be at
[1:58:30] taking me in and and
[1:58:34] uh i go by sister connie and she's
[1:58:36] eating breakfast
[1:58:38] and it kind of reminds me of going
[1:58:40] beyond the curtain of time
[1:58:41] she's eating breakfast and she's sitting
[1:58:44] over eating breakfast and she's talking
[1:58:46] to somebody on the phone and i'm going
[1:58:48] blondie
[1:58:50] blondie
[1:58:54] but the bed didn't stop she didn't hear
[1:58:56] me
[1:58:58] and i'm going down and i've never been
[1:59:00] in this kind of pain and they pulled me
[1:59:01] up
[1:59:02] and they pulled me in a spot and finally
[1:59:04] i got myself at some peace
[1:59:06] and i told the nurse and he was a
[1:59:08] therapist and i told him i said
[1:59:10] man i gotta have some help he said
[1:59:12] understand i got help on the way
[1:59:14] shot number one shot number two shot
[1:59:17] number three
[1:59:20] and now i'm starting to calm down a
[1:59:21] little bit
[1:59:24] so we start talking and he's the son of
[1:59:26] a baptist preacher
[1:59:28] he's he's my age he's chew he tells me
[1:59:30] all about his children
[1:59:32] you don't have time for me to tell you
[1:59:33] those stories but but i can remember
[1:59:35] them for you this morning and
[1:59:38] you know and there's another lady
[1:59:40] sitting over there and
[1:59:41] she's got tumor in her head and she's
[1:59:43] got five more in her body
[1:59:45] and they're going to they're going to
[1:59:47] give her all of the
[1:59:49] gamma ray that morning and this guy's
[1:59:52] been doing it for about 20 years and
[1:59:55] he set him there and he said man what
[1:59:58] great attitude you've got and i said
[2:00:00] yeah i said but just been in a lot of
[2:00:02] pain this morning he said oh we'll get
[2:00:04] that taken care of
[2:00:09] i said i bet you meet a lot of people
[2:00:11] here he said 20 years i'd meet
[2:00:13] i meet anywhere from three to five
[2:00:14] people a day here
[2:00:16] he said just a process he said you know
[2:00:19] cancer is a
[2:00:20] is a living organism in your body
[2:00:24] he said it's a it's an attachment of a
[2:00:28] of a demon that gets a dead
[2:00:31] cell that's bruised and he said it gets
[2:00:34] on a living cell
[2:00:36] and it begins to suck the life out of it
[2:00:40] and he said before long it begins to
[2:00:42] multiply and there's a lot of cancer in
[2:00:44] there
[2:00:45] he said now we use the term fight it or
[2:00:49] tell it to take its leave
[2:00:52] he said but cancer if you're not careful
[2:00:55] will just start spreading through the
[2:00:57] body it'll just start spreading just as
[2:01:00] quick as it
[2:01:01] can and you can start saying well i'm
[2:01:03] going to whip it i'm going to whip it
[2:01:05] he said you be careful he said you'll
[2:01:07] cause that thing to get mad and it'll
[2:01:08] run all through its body
[2:01:11] he said but you start telling it to
[2:01:13] leave
[2:01:14] he said because jesus
[2:01:18] told those demons in that man's
[2:01:22] body legion to leave
[2:01:27] he said so you do like jesus did tell
[2:01:30] them to take their leave
[2:01:33] even if they go to pigs are you with me
[2:01:35] now brother tim pruitt
[2:01:42] i was in this man's care connie came and
[2:01:45] she sat with me until i went to that
[2:01:48] spot
[2:01:51] this man began to talk to me
[2:01:55] he had prayer with us
[2:02:00] he said i know you're getting ready to
[2:02:01] go through a very difficult procedure
[2:02:03] he said i'll just pray with you if
[2:02:04] that's okay
[2:02:08] i said how does other people react here
[2:02:12] he said well i wish everybody reacted
[2:02:14] like you do
[2:02:16] or like this girl here does
[2:02:19] they had just taken her away he said you
[2:02:22] know
[2:02:23] both of you have about four months to
[2:02:25] live
[2:02:27] he said you know that i'm not giving you
[2:02:29] any news
[2:02:30] they were wrong
[2:02:34] they were wrong he said
[2:02:38] you know you don't have a bunch of
[2:02:40] family here because this was before
[2:02:41] covet
[2:02:44] he said yesterday he said i had a i had
[2:02:47] a
[2:02:47] i had a young person here about 20 years
[2:02:51] old
[2:02:52] had a spot about that big on him
[2:02:57] and he said they had an entire group of
[2:02:59] family here he said they had 20 people
[2:03:01] here
[2:03:03] he said they were bawling he said they
[2:03:05] were stressed out
[2:03:06] they were going nuts
[2:03:10] he said they were going nuts
[2:03:13] he said finally i had enough
[2:03:19] he said hold on folks
[2:03:23] i got some good news for you
[2:03:27] he's got a spot about that big
[2:03:31] he's going to die in about 40 years
[2:03:38] but if you'll take the attitude of this
[2:03:40] one over here
[2:03:42] he's gonna die probably in about four
[2:03:45] months
[2:03:46] and have the right mental attitude ever
[2:03:48] heard those words before
[2:03:52] brother brown said if you have the right
[2:03:54] mental attitude toward any divine
[2:03:56] promise of god
[2:03:57] it'll become to pass
[2:04:07] listen you can either take the attitude
[2:04:09] this thing's going to destroy you
[2:04:11] or you're going to destroy it and
[2:04:14] brother brown said you got to destroy
[2:04:16] your enemy before it destroys you
[2:04:21] if i had to go through the trial and he
[2:04:23] told me i was going through the trial
[2:04:26] he said i'll be with you i will be in
[2:04:29] you
[2:04:29] i'll never leave you to the end of the
[2:04:31] world
[2:04:35] are you with me now he knew satan was
[2:04:38] coming
[2:04:39] he knew the cancer was on the way
[2:04:48] they're having all of my children
[2:04:51] to be tested all my
[2:04:54] my children my grandchildren not my
[2:04:57] in-laws my
[2:04:58] my children that i pass my blood to
[2:05:02] because there's a chance that they're
[2:05:05] passed it to them
[2:05:07] not my wife but i passed it to them
[2:05:12] i'm supposed to go to a uh uh
[2:05:16] i don't have my brain with me now i'm
[2:05:19] supposed to go
[2:05:20] to a genetic
[2:05:23] doctor in a few few weeks and they'll
[2:05:26] discover they'll go through my dna code
[2:05:30] to find that what other kind of cancer
[2:05:32] is fighting me
[2:05:35] or my grandchildren or any other
[2:05:36] grandchildren
[2:05:38] and i thought about that i've got that
[2:05:41] covered
[2:05:46] i got that covered because on my way
[2:05:50] into that tunnel i prayed a prayer
[2:05:55] father if i have to go through and i'm
[2:05:57] going to quit with this i was going
[2:05:59] i'll use i'll give you these scriptures
[2:06:01] next week but
[2:06:02] father if i have to go through this
[2:06:07] let me be the one that breaks the
[2:06:14] cycle
[2:06:18] and i just didn't pray it for my
[2:06:20] children and my
[2:06:22] grandchildren but i prayed it for this
[2:06:24] entire audience
[2:06:29] because jesus prayed these kind of a
[2:06:31] prayers
[2:06:40] he defeated cancer that i could be set
[2:06:42] free he defeated tuperculosis that you
[2:06:45] could be set free
[2:06:46] he defeated paralyzed conditions that i
[2:06:49] could be set free
[2:06:51] greater than all of that he defeated sin
[2:06:58] let me just say this is a final
[2:06:59] statement tonight
[2:07:01] if the urge to quit continues to stay in
[2:07:04] your mind
[2:07:05] tell it to go back to the realms of the
[2:07:08] lost
[2:07:09] and stay there we are more than over
[2:07:13] [Applause]
[2:07:24] thomas
[2:07:31] i press towards the mark of the prize of
[2:07:34] the high calling
[2:07:35] of god in christ jesus i want to say
[2:07:38] this to you
[2:07:39] i refuse to retreat i refuse to give up
[2:07:44] brother ron that's a bold statement
[2:07:46] knowing where you're standing
[2:07:47] knowing where i'm standing i refuse to
[2:07:52] retreat
[2:07:59] i refuse to give up
[2:08:04] you're an interesting audience and you
[2:08:06] can stand and musicians
[2:08:08] can come
[2:08:13] very interesting audience
[2:08:35] i want you to get this that's why i'm
[2:08:37] waiting
[2:08:41] the founder of this church some of you
[2:08:44] never knew
[2:08:48] but he was one of the best friends of my
[2:08:50] life
[2:08:52] and i enjoyed working with him
[2:08:55] i enjoyed him being my father-in-law
[2:08:58] i enjoyed him he was rough he was tough
[2:09:02] he had a heart 42 times the ford size of
[2:09:04] a board truck
[2:09:07] he loved you whether you knew it or not
[2:09:11] he was rough and how he told you you
[2:09:13] needed to lock the doors or clean to
[2:09:16] show you how to vacuum a floor he
[2:09:19] preached every sermon like it was the
[2:09:21] last sermon he was ever going to preach
[2:09:23] and you better get it
[2:09:24] and he made sure that you knew that you
[2:09:26] it was you because he sometimes would
[2:09:28] call your name
[2:09:34] but when it got difficult for him he sat
[2:09:37] in a wheelchair
[2:09:39] and he would take pain pills coming up
[2:09:41] that ramp that you built brother ray
[2:09:44] and he would take pain pills so he could
[2:09:46] set to the service
[2:09:48] there was no quit in him
[2:09:51] and he preached his last sermon on be
[2:09:54] ready
[2:09:55] in such an hour as you think not be
[2:09:58] ready
[2:10:03] let me just say he took every excuse to
[2:10:06] miss church
[2:10:07] and just tore it up and ripped it you're

[2:10:11] reason

[2:10:22] i'm using that from doug baker so that's
[2:10:26] where
[2:10:37] and i have just preached to you
[2:10:42] feeling like i need to be in my bunny
[2:10:44] slippers if i had some
[2:10:49] but the sermon that says

[2:11:46] weekend
[2:11:47] next weekend labor day has a very
[2:11:51] special attachment to me
[2:11:53] because there was a day there was a day
[2:11:56] in my life that i wasn't
[2:11:58] doing what's right
[2:12:01] and i was working in a meat market
[2:12:05] cutting meat and i was in a very
[2:12:08] i was in a place that a lot of people
[2:12:10] should have been ashamed of me
[2:12:12] in my life not of the shame of the
[2:12:14] grocery store
[2:12:16] but i was just in a bad way
[2:12:20] i grew up in church
[2:12:23] now i'm going to say some things that
[2:12:24] might get a little sticky
[2:12:28] but there was a lot of preachers that
[2:12:30] would want nothing to do with me
[2:12:32] even after i become converted
[2:12:36] let me just say this to you i've always
[2:12:38] been a guy
[2:12:41] that pretty suits and all kind of
[2:12:43] revelated quotes
[2:12:45] don't impress me a whole lot
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:50] being better than the sinner don't
[2:12:52] impress me a whole lot
[2:12:56] i won't never have those kind of
[2:12:58] preachers preach here
[2:13:02] lazy men people that think they're more
[2:13:04] revelated than other people

[2:13:10] but there was some godly men that came
[2:13:13] to me
[2:13:14] one being henry greene and dan daisley
[2:13:19] and they came in and they leaned across
[2:13:21] the meat counter
[2:13:23] and talked to me like i was somebody
[2:13:29] and they made me feel like somebody
[2:13:33] cared
[2:13:37] and i want you to know every person
[2:13:40] across this yup this
[2:13:41] audience i want you to know
