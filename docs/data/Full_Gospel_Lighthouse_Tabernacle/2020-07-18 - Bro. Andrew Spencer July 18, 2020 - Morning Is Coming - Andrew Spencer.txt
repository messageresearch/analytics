going to happen worth it was going to happen he thought it was going to happen because god said so amen he didn't say oh wonder if i create you one of my faces long enough whatever they did he just

and though i've had my share of hearts by my side is always true [Music] my oh my savior and my friend his love was my beginning and his love will be my end i could spend forever trying to tell you everything here [Music] [Music] streams [Music] is true through it all god's been done [Applause] looking forward there's a lighthouse on a hill that overlooks like see [Music] when i'm tossed it sends out a light that i might see and the light that shines in darkness now will safely lead me over if it wasn't for that lighthouse my ship would sail more [Music] and i thank god for the lighthouse i owe my life to him king jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has [Music] shown [Music] that i could clearly see if it wasn't for that lighthouse tell me where would this be [Music] now everybody that lives about me says tear that lighthouse down see the big ships don't sell that way anymore and there's no use in it standing round then my mind goes back to that stormy night when just in time i saw the light yes the light [Music] and i thank god for the lighthouse i owe my life to him king jesus is the lighthouse and from the rocks of sin he has shown a lie around me that i could clearly see if it wasn't for [Music] that lighthouse tell me where would this ship be amen blessed be the name of the lord aren't you thankful for the lighthouse amen god has been so good to us to shine his light upon us in this hour that we might see the truth of this day and we can never be grateful enough or thankful enough but we can surely begin to praise him on this side of glory for all the things that he's done for us we can never repay god has been he's been he's been better to me than i could ever be to him but i want to do my very best in life to be able to serve him with every portion of my spirit and soul i want to do my very best humanly capable to be able to serve him and when i'm too weak to serve him may my spirit continue may my soul just begin to reach out in that realm and praise him when i'm unconscious subconscious whatever life may throw at us we want to continually praise the lord jesus christ we thank you for the atmosphere that's been set here this evening we feel the welcoming of the holy ghost and and we're just thankful for all the things that god is doing amongst us the week that we've had we've made it another week and we're we're here to testify the good and things of god and so we just love the lord with all of our heart we we shared the news with you this evening from brother donny reagan about his daughter sister erica parker and just remember them in prayer you know that they're under a great stress load and we see as the enemy is on a rampage he's very upset at the ministry of christ and he's always attacking the ministry and and it seems like if he can't get you he'll try to get to your wife or try to get to your children but we're not going to bend now or back up on god's promises and neither is god but we want to continue to lift up brother donny and his family there and know let them know with everything that is within us that we're praying for every situation that comes across this desk we we sincerely pray and we know the angel of the lord is very sensitive to these needs and we just ask him to take control and the things that we're seeing amongst our own pastor and sister karen these things are of god and no man can do these things i just got this note before we walked out uh sister karen was able to go today to like a little dining setting with her with one of her family members and start putting together a 300 piece puzzle brother tim said that don't that sounds pretty good for somebody that was supposed to be a vegetable how about that satan missed he missed and we just we just thank the lord that we're able to be a part of these things to be a part and see our eyes are open to see that god is god is doing these things i'm i'm friends with people that that hear about these things and they just turn them down and don't think nothing of them but i sure do i sure see the hand of the lord in these things and and i'm privileged i feel very honored to be able to see the hand of god in our midst amen maybe we could stand this evening and uh maybe we'll sing that song worshiping you amen before we go to the word this evening amen amen worshiping you [Music] there's

do tonight to worship the lord jesus when you go to lifting your hand you're not lifting your hand to me you man but you're defying gravity and you're saying i surrender these needs into the lord let's surrender our needs before the father tonight heavenly father we come before your great presence lord sensing the nearness of the holy spirit father lord knowing that you have gathered to to come and to commune with your children here this evening lord jesus there's so many things father that we could say sometimes we don't even know the right words to even put in in in word form to be able to pray those things but lord we we look back to how you taught us how to pray and you said our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever god so many times we struggle with the part of forgiving forgiving one another forgiving ourselves father i pray that you would allow the spirit of forgiveness to come into our hearts come in this place fathering forgive us of the deeds of this week father the things that we said that we truly didn't mean father i pray that as we would just begin to enter into the spirit of worship and lord i pray as we come here tonight to bless your holy name that that you'd receive our worship that you receive our a man's father that we agree with the things of god and the the the word that's been released in this hour we agree with it lord i just want to see you high and lifted up here tonight lord we we pray father for the for the people of god lord you see the situations and the needs and the hearts lord jesus that are so burdened by these needs we know that you're able to to go into the uttermost father and to bring about a tremendous victory father and lord we pray that you would reach into the realm of the supernatural father as we begin to let our faith loose father now to to be able to see you father we pray that that your children that have gathered here tonight lord and those that couldn't gather here tonight due to circumstances we pray that you would go into that realm father we would call it a telephone hookup but father you know where every person is sitting tonight lord and i pray that you'd stir their faith i pray that you would allow them to be able to muster up the faith lord that they would not wobble back and forth on what they believed but they would remain committed to their confession father and that they would stand steadfast in the truth of love divine father lord we gather here tonight lord for one purpose and that's to draw closer to you now i pray father that you would anoint us lord lord i yield my members to you every fiber of my being i give it to you i ask that the god of william branham tonight would speak through these mortal lips and that the hearts of the believers would receive the things that only you can give not of my self-father i know you're present and i know you're near and i just ask god that you do something that only you could do i ask these things in your name the name of jesus christ amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll return to daniel chapter 6 and verse 16. amen daniel chapter 6 and verse 16. i'd like to to speak uh speak a thought tonight on on morning is coming morning is coming and i know it may i know it may sound simple to you and it may just be a statement to you but maybe if that's all you catch tonight it's a statement of mourning is coming you can realize from that statement that darkness can't last but so long daniel chapter 6 and verse 16. and the bible says then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy thy god whom thou service continually he will deliver thee now notice the the admiration that the king has for daniel and also the admiration for daniel's god and the stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of music brought before him and his sleep went from him then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou serve us continually able to deliver thee from the lions now notice the question of the king o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou serve as continually able to deliver thee from the lions now this has been a rough night it's been a rough night it's been a it's a night that that's been much agony on the king as you see that his sleep has had went away from him but i want you to notice in verse 21 these these very powerful words you may have read over this this statement or read over these scriptures a thousand times it's very familiar scripture to our children but notice these first words then said daniel unto the king now what was meant to be silenced has a voice what was meant to be shut up has a voice i trust you never read over those words the same way again then said daniel unto the king a voice that was meant to be shut up o king live forever my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt then was the king exceeding glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god hallelujah may god bless the reading of the word he may be seated in the presence of the lord turn with thee over to mark chapter 16 and verse one morning is coming and the darkness can't stop it mark 16-1 and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun it's always a very magical or maybe that's not the word that we would say but it's a very amazing thing when you step out early in the mornings and it's it's such an hour of utter darkness but you know that if god is still on the throne that there is coming forth a power that will push back all of the darkness that has been there all throughout the nighttime and it's such an amazing thing and it's it's it's actually extraordinary to me as when you wake up early in the morning i believe that the bible said to seek him early in the morning and i believe that sometimes that many people miss a lot of things as is early in the morning times when you should be seeking god and fasting or laying before the lord that those are times in which when all the demon powers of hell have been shut down for the night and that's when the lord of heaven begins to deal with his children is early in the mornings and it's an amazing thing when you know and you watch that great big ball of fire as it comes up in the morning and you can feel it as it begins to rise upon the nature around you and you can watch how everything in nature begins to testify of the power that is on the inside of that ball now it looks like a great big yellow ball up there in the sky but it has a power that everything in earth and everything and in the sky is testifying of its power and it's so powerful that every bit of energy that that comes that that is seen upon this earth comes from this great big ball of fire and and we know that science tells us that the sun is 93 million miles away from us but yet in the morning there is something that is so magnificent when it begins to shine upon your side of the earth now that sun's been shining all day long all throughout the hours through 24 hours that sun has been shining now maybe you can't see it on your side of the earth but that sun is shining upon somebody else maybe in the western countries or in the eastern countries but through the night time you're you're there and you're looking and you're waiting for morning to come but you know that morning is coming you see even josh will realize the power of the sun because he realized that that if darkness would come that the enemy could could gather themselves together and they could get themselves and they could and they could harness harness themselves in the darkness you see that's where darkness is harnessed that's where the enemy harnesses its power is in the midst of darkness but in an hour when it seems like there is no sun around there is an hour when the moon is there and that moon is a reflection of the power that comes from the sun now that moon has no power without the sun during the daytime but because of the power that is in that sun it is a reflection and that moon it is a reflecting of that light and it may be in such a time when you feel like there is no god around you but there is a bride of jesus christ that cannot do anything unless he is doing it and if we do anything apart from the groom then we are not the bride but if he did it as the groom then the bride can come in right behind it and say thus saith the lord because she is testifying of the quickening power of almighty god that there is a s-o-o-s-o-n that is still more than able to do all things through a people there is power in the sun now and i want you to notice this just to just to kind of set this in place brother branham said in what thinking of christ and he daniel was given witness and he said another thing one day for my testimony they throwed me into a den of lions while i was standing there and the first thing i seen and their first thing i seen was lines and i heard their soft padded paws and i could feel their breath almost on me in that dark dungeon in a few minutes i i'd be tore together and all of a sudden something moved every fiber in my body i felt something tingling my face turned hot and chills went through me and i i seen where the lines the eyes of the lions coming and the first thing you know they begin to turn their head and walk away and when i felt when when that feeling left me i looked standing in the corner and there stood one who is the son of god standing there god had sent his angels to deliver me and i can hear him say that power that was upon me my muscles were just shaking the power that was going through me tears was coming down my cheeks he's the son of god i wonder today what think ye of christ when you were going through a midst of darkness in the midst of trouble what think ye of christ did you see that one that would walk with the walk with the three hebrew children and he would be the fourth man in the fire brother danny steamon wrote us a note one time he said there is plenty of room in this fire for the fourth man and i want you to know we're not out of it yet we may be seeing signs of victories but there's still plenty of room for the fourth man when i get on the outside of the fire there's still plenty of room for him are you with me and before daniel ever got put in the lion's den there was an angel that was on his way but i want you to notice the attachment of the king with daniel i want you to see how he loved daniel how that he respected daniel and it showed the love that that the king had for daniel that his sleep had went away from him all throughout the night i want you to know that there's a god that's got his eye on you he is the king of kings and he is the lord of lords there is a special attachment between you and him and there's not going to be nothing that goes on that will tear that apart though the enemy try to strip you of your health and strip you of your wealth and strip you of your family there will be an attachment with the king of kings no matter what you go through in 2020 he's still got his eye on you are you with me he still got his eye on you this this year that we're living in it is a 2020 it's a year of perfect vision it's a year it's a year in which nobody wish we there's a lot of things that have happened and a lot of people would wish some things away but at the year of 2020 it's a day an hour that we're living in utter chaos there's not one of you that's not been affected by 2020. there's not a one of you that's sitting here that are doing the same things that you were doing in 2019 you're doing it now in some way in some form you're doing something different because of what 2020 has brought behind it there's been statements that have been said that 2020 has had a bad hair day every day it's been said that 2020 needs to have a snickers it's been said that 2020 has been all kinds of shook up you see everybody has been affected by 2020. there's been everybody that's been affected by covet in some way though you may not feel like it's real and maybe you don't believe in covet or whatever it may be there are people there are things that you cannot do because of an a a an invisible enemy out there that you can't see so every person has been through something maybe you believe it's real maybe you don't believe it's real but i know that there's a real devil out there that is doing his best to try to stop the move of god but this year has been rough on every person there's not been a person on the face of the earth that has not been affected by covet 19 or by 2020 it's been a rough year for believers but in a situation like this it has been a year of miracles it's been a year in which we has to look back and testify that god has been with us are you with me so we see that there's no miracle without a mess and if you look at 20 20 and a hole it's a perfect set up for god to show forth and to declare his power that he is jehovah [Music] so if you're looking for a spot to see a miracle you have showed up to 2020 where you can look out upon 2020 with perfect vision by a prophetic eagle age that you're living in and you can see that there's a people that will overcome 2020 we won't just barely pass through we're going to come through on the other side of this saying winning every victory that stands in front of us morning is coming it's dark out there if you if you've lived for very much long a very long time you realize that it's very dark outside no i'm not talking about the light outside right now i'm talking about the spiritual the spiritual thermometer upon the world and you look out and all you see is complete laotia and you look out and you see that when the light is not there that there is darkness that is coming and you look out upon the coldness of the lukewarmness of laodicea and its affecting everybody there's not one believer that's sitting here tonight that would testify that they were not affected by laodicea this week i'd say ever i'd say 100 whether you want to agree with me or tonight or not you have been affected by laodicea in some way good or bad you have been affected by it but i want to i want to bring it to your attention that there is a god that is with you when you don't feel like he's with you there is there is a time in which you can't be with your pastor can't be with your friends can't be with your loved ones or be with the deacon board to be able to rely upon somebody that you can lay your hands on and they can lay hands on you and you get through the day it's a time when you don't feel like anything's working he is working a way to bring about his miracle working power through you now i want you to know i want you to think about this maybe maybe you've been in a spot like this before you ever been in a spot when you knew something was coming you just knew it was coming it was a perfect it was a perfect setup that you knew something was coming but the moment that it comes that the event that you know is coming when it comes the event is greater than what you expected you ever been in a spot like that when you were expecting you expecting a happy meal and you get the big mac but have you ever walked through life you ever walk through life and you know that something is coming that there's something that's going to work out for your good but when it comes it's so much more it's so much more greater than what you expected i want you to know just to relate some of my heart to you this evening there have been some times in this journey where there have been utter darkness completely surrounding me as a mortal being there have been times in this journey when i thought oh god if you don't show up i don't know what's going to take place there's been some spots i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to open myself up and make myself vulnerable to you tonight so that you get what i'm saying but there have been some spots when it was all dark around me i remember taking a walk up through my woods one day and it was some bad news that was dropping down from headquarters over in uva and they didn't made up their mind that that this was what they was going to do and if this don't work we don't know what we're going to do and i had myself a good old walk with jesus and i as i begin to walk i began to go through there and just begin to lay out my heart before god and now i don't know why i'm making myself vulnerable like this but god's got a reason in doing it i told dad before service this is going to be one of those sermons kind of like riding a horse you don't know which way it's going to take you but here here i am making this walk and i could feel the darkness you ever been in a spot where it's so dark you ever been down in a cave when you could feel the darkness it was it was actually penetrating the darkness was actually penetrating and it felt like everything around you was was affected by the darkness you all know what i mean and here i am walking and all of a sudden it just begin to drop in my heart that i've got this i know that he had it the whole time there's not nothing in my faith that wavered but you know sometimes you're on an emotional roller coaster and you're going every which away from straight and i was going through these things and i finally reached down to a spot and i said now look here satan i'm not going to it's either going to be me and you standing here and i'm not leaving off of what god said so you might as well go ahead and leave so i went ahead and started blessing the name of jesus i began to tell him all the things that i was going through all the things that i was facing as a young pastor all the things that i was looking at and going through at that time looking at the enemy that had tried to come and steal my dad and steal my pastor still my best friend it looked like darkness was all around and at that time i began to see as the light began to break over top of me that darkness could not stay when i was praising the one that had all power in heaven and in earth if you would go to praising god tonight i wonder what would break loose in this place you come to a place that is a perfect place for you to get transformed you walked in here with all kinds of utter chaos that's went on in the last week and you've got all kinds of baggage that you don't know what to do with but you have found a perfect spot to drop off your luggage this is not a tsa protection or an order that you go through and do this but i'm telling you that there is a conveyor line where you can drop off your baggage and you don't have to pick it back up at the end of the road the reason why people love their luggage is because what's in that luggage is them and they don't want to get rid of the luggage because they're in love with the luggage but oh if you could ever let loose i wonder what would really transpire in a service like this if you would really go to letting yourself loose and you begin to bless the lord and you begin to praise his name and you begin to trust him with your life trust him with your mind trust him with yourself that's a big one right there but you begin to trust him with your whole life i wonder what would really cut loose in this place if you gave your absolute all in your praise in your worship in your atmosphere and everything what would happen if you would let yourself loose i'd say that it would be a rocking and a reeling down in hell because there's a people that have refused to receive what the devil's tried to give to them hallelujah hallelujah surely odyssey is dark sure the chaos of the world is dark but what about the god that's on your side don't forget the power of the s-o-n when it sets on the inside of your soul it'll make you talk in a different language it'll make you dance it'll make you shout it'll make you lose outside of your fears sure cancer is bad sure tumors are bad sure brain bleeds are bad but there is a god that's greater than the bad sure daniel was in there all night long but he knew that morning was coming sure the things you're going through is dark sure they're going to hurt you you may you may you may not be like daniel and walk out unharmed you may actually have some scars not every situation is perfect but i want to point you to a god that is you'll watch somebody that is scarred by adultery and they're scarred by things in their pastor and their parents past you watch every time that it's mentioned they begin to put up a wall they begin to put up a blockage and they don't want to go there because it's too hard it's too harmful for their own personal walk that they will not walk down that path but if they could ever let themselves loose that god is a healer walk with me down this path for a minute there's some there's some dark roads that are in front of you that are scarful they're hurtful but if you could ever let let loose that god is a healer that he'll heal all of your broken heart that he'll hell he'll heal every situation that you're going through if you can let yourself loose to walk down that path with me tonight i want you to i want to tell you that when you come out on the other side of that thing that you're so vulnerable that you don't want to go into that you don't want to talk about it you just want to shut everything up around you and you don't want to talk about it you need to have a talk with jesus what we're seeing is none other than a move of god what you're seeing how many loves you pastor amen what you're seeing in your pastor is none other than a move of god what we have seen through these last six months and i'm using this last six months is your life just now but what we've seen in these last six months is none other than jesus and i was having a conversation with my buddy brother jason jackson and we were just speaking over these things that he said you know he said i know it wasn't easy to put all your trust in him when it looks so dark but i realize that it's the darkest right before dawn and that morning is coming you see you that are hunters and you ever been out sitting in the tree stand a little bit early easy you've been sitting out there a little early and you realize and you're trying to get to your spot before anything else gets to moving and you're sitting out there and it is dark that is when right before dawn it's its darkest moment it's also the coldest moment because darkness is pushing itself together because it knows that there's a power that's rising up on the other side you see that power is always there that power is not leaving he's not changing where he's at everything else around it can rotate but it stays stable and it's just before the darkest you've been sitting out there you got the best of gear you got the sitka gear you dressed up to the nines in the tree stand and man and somebody walked through from mossy oak man they get your picture in a minute but it's right there on the edge of edge of light coming man it gets cold and here you are you are in a moment of time when it's the coldest that it's ever been it's negative 40 spiritually speaking and ain't nobody on fire for god outside of you i know it's hard to swallow but swallow that thing you sitting there in a spot when nobody is rejoicing you're sitting in a spot where nobody else is in revival and you don't have to have emotion just to get a just to know that god is there you don't have to have fast preaching to know that god is there you don't have to have loud services to know god is there but you can sit there in the stillness of a moment and you can realize that god is right there watching you in your utter chaos of life and when nobody else is rejoicing you're taking a look around and say my jesus am i the only one that's getting this what is it the light shining on you you see darkness has zero harmony with light because if one exists the other has to be displaced you remember when john in the book of john it tells us that that the light shined in darkness but the darkness comprehended if it not you see it's saying to us that jesus alight was shining upon ignorant men but they would not receive it because of darkness that was that was working all around them you see but darkness cannot stay in the presence of the light it cannot do that because light is 10 million times stronger than darkness so light and darkness cannot dwell together just like when your sin falls into the blood of jesus christ it cannot dwell together you have to make a choice whether it's going to be your sin or it's going to be the blood of jesus christ you're going to make a choice whether it's going to be your luggage or it's going to be the blood of jesus christ i know what i chose a long time ago when i had so much baggage as a pastor's kid that nobody wanted to talk to me that nobody wanted to be friends with me when everybody gave up on me but the blood didn't give up [Applause] some of the same critics that are criticizing you are the people that would have never allowed me in a pulpit that would never allow me to overcoming life and it's saying so those same critics that need the blood of jesus christ it's those same critics that never can overcome and overcome one day in their life much less a year but it's the blood that has put me in this pulpit it's the blood that covered my sin it's the blood that washes away all of my iniquities sure there was some baggage in my life there was drugs in my life there was all kinds of filthy things in my life but one day i heard a voice it said morning it's coming [Applause] oh hallelujah suicide couldn't stay in the picture when the morning begin to rise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah there's a legend just a story there's a legend about this cave that was one time having a conversation with the son this cave began to expose itself a little bit begin to talk remember it's just a story you believe in a cave talking we need to have more than prayer but the cave was having a conversation of the son and he began to tell him man it's so dark in here nobody comes to me nobody comes nobody begins to converse with me i'm so scared here it makes me draw back in my innermost being and i don't want to i don't want to step out and i don't want to i don't i don't know what to do because i'm so scared of the dark and the sun began to talk to him said well how about i come down there and i'll take a look around your cave and see what's really so scary about it so the sun comes down into the cave and it begins to take a look all around and it begins to look through the cave and it says i don't see nothing scary in here see but but it's so dark he said i don't see no darkness here you see when the sun comes there's no darkness when the sun comes there's nothing scary about it oh hallelujah i can walk i can walk through the valley of the shadow of death as long as i know that there's a sun with me i can walk through hell as long as i know there's a sun with me i can walk through cancer as long as i know there's a sun with me i can walk through trials as long as i know the sun is with me i know that there is no such a thing as darkness when the s-o-n begins to shine down on me when the children of israel was put in babylon man they had some trials they had to stand alone but before you can ever have a victory you got to have some trials are you with me before before you can ever have a victory you're gonna have you have to have a war but you see i want you to notice this that you don't have to give out your resume to god you don't have to go through life and show god what you can do and what you can't do you don't have to go through god you don't have to go through your resume of life and tell god well i did this and i did this i'm capable of doing this and i'm not capable of doing that god don't need your resume god knows everything about you god knows what you've been through he knows what you're going to go through he knows how to bring you out on the other side of things completely and perfectly whole god knows everything about you because if you were a gene of god you were in god at the very beginning before there was a molecule or an attribute of anything that was ever spoke if you were in god's mind there is going to be nothing that can come by your way that can rob you from being in his in his throne being in him being a part of him if you were in god at the very beginning as a germ of god so god placed this germ on the inside of you that gene seed of god and he knew what the capacity of your seed could handle now god knows if he can trust you god knows that he can have if you can handle the responsibility of preaching he knows that if you can handle the responsibility of song leading he knows if you can handle the responsibility as being a lay member or whatnot god knows the capacity of that seed and he knows what he's deposited and sometimes people get so upset because they can't produce a hundred when they're only when they're only a 30 seed but in the elect god knows what he has deposited and he knows what he's going to get out you see when god had deposited the seeds before time he placed those seeds in the earth and he said let there be light and when the light began to shine over the darkness it began to bring out in the firmament it began to bring out in the earth all of the seeds that was deposited by his spoken word he begin to release by the quickening power of the s-u-n now god knows exactly what he has deposited now there might be some here brother brennan will tell us that there's three kind of believers in every church service make believers real believers and unbelievers now god knows what he has deposited on the inside of you and if you are an unbeliever that same power that rolls over to a real believer will not affect you in any way you can feel the tingle run over top of you and you say whoa i got it but this is not upon emotions this is upon what is going on that's on the inside where the seed has been deposited and when there is no motion and when there is no style of fiery preaching that soul says that's for me hallelujah so many times people get acquainted or get attached to a style of preaching and they say well i like that style of preaching but the style of preaching does not change the anointing are you with me i've been in services where i heard people talk with such a monotone monotone voice and you think my am i ever going to get anything out of this but it would be the most powerful service you ever been in and then i've been in services man a guy could tear the chandeliers down and i didn't get nothing out of it because it does not change in styles of preaching neither does the piano change are you with me let me give it to you like this a piano don't change because somebody plays pentecostal or they pick or they begin to play in classical or different ways it does not change the piano it only changes the style now there is a gene seed of god that is going to come forth and is going to produce no matter what style it's under the anointing souls the anointing shows what is really on the inside of you that anointing is a very powerful thing some of you sit here and maybe never say a man or never clap your hands but some of you so genuine gold that the devil can't do nothing with you i'll take you every day of the week but i wouldn't give 10 cents for a penny i wouldn't give 10 cents for a penny but i'll look out upon this congregation i don't believe there's too many pennies sitting here i believe there's some real silver dollars that are sitting here sure there's going to be some accusers that try to mock and make fun of joseph but joseph what was inside of joseph could not be changed and it could not be stopped because it was on the inside of him oh hallelujah and joseph could live right joseph could stand right and he didn't even have a baptism of the holy ghost but what about the real silver dollars in this day that can live and overcome in life when every demon in hell wants to shut us down you still overcome you still win you still have the victory it must show you something it's what's inside of you you look over at revelations chapter 9 you begin to look at all the scriptures and you begin to see the smoke that comes out of the bottomless pit and you can look at those two hundred thousand thousand horses and those demons that rise out of the river euphrates and you look at those things and begin to look at it and you see it those demons are released you see they were bound in the river euphrates for 2000 years and they were there waiting and when the seals released those those are those 200 000 000 demons were released out of the river euphrates now what these are are fallen angels now these are fallen angels you can look over in isaiah 14 and 12 and you can see where we're lucifer the son of the morning it was falling and you can read over in jude chapter 1 and verse 6 and you can see of their first estate and you can look at these things as a fallen fallen creation and you see these things they were created to worship god they were created to be able to they were able to be able to worship and praise god and sing holy holy unto the lord but because of their fall they they were a fallen angel but notice they lost their position but they did not lose their power and you watch as young people are battling and you see them as a battling music and you identify what spirit is coming from it'll tell you that there is a a realm of darkness that has a control on young people and there are those angels that were built to worship that know how to enter into music and so slip in and bring about oh my such such crazy nonsense called music but you watch the attachment of young people and you source back that attachment and if it's leading them to suicide if it's leading them to depression you source back their music and it'll tell you which realm it's coming from but you can source back a bride and you can look at her and you can look at her atmosphere you can look at her power you can see what realm she is influenced by are you with me so we see that here there's two hundred thousand thousand horses of demons that are released in this day now these were not natural horses they were spiritual devils because they were breathing fire and out of their mouth is how they would hurt now you watch watch those things watch revelations 9 and you look at the chaos of rudder revelations 9 but then it rolls over into revelations 10 and it says and i saw another mighty angel now you're either going to be influenced by the realm of darkness or the realm of light and you look out upon the attack of the ministry of this hour you see brother brother ron spencer you see brother donnie reagan you see his daughter you see brother tim and you see you see sister karen and you see all of these other events as the bride of jesus christ is being attacked you look at these things and you realize where the attack is coming from it's coming from a power that had been bound for 2 000 years brother branham said in the feast of trumpets he said he said that those those those demons have been bound there for 2 000 years he said but the church had bound the holy ghost for the same amount of two thousand years he said it was not bound in the river euphrates but it was bound by church doors by creeds and by dogmas he said but i'm telling you that there is coming and the church is going to be liberated by the holy ghost and there's not going to be nothing that the demons of hell will be able to stop the move of god when the holy ghost goes to moving when the holy ghost goes to acting it's been liberated over a people and there's not one demon power that has enough to stop to stop the move of god they can bring all of their imps they can bring two hundred thousand thousand of them that ain't been released for two thousand years and they will never stop this almighty power i'd say this horse we got's a pretty good one hallelujah you watch a people that's influenced by the realm of darkness they're so bound up in depression bound up in jealousy bound up in all types of things they're bound up in themselves and you watch which realm they're influenced by but you begin to watch the children of god that's been liberated by an almighty power you watch they'll dance different they'll walk different they'll talk different they'll work different because there is a liberation that is taking place on the inside of her soul mourning's coming sure he's going to attack you the attack does not change who you are it does not change who you are sure is going to attack you they lost their position but they did not lose their power and they hate you because of your position they hate you for everything that you stand up for they hate you for all that is good and all that is right they hate you and they're going to attack you but they do not attack you because you are weak they attack you because you are strong they attack you because they know that you're going to win they attack you and the attack does not show does not mean and it does not weaken you the attack shows who you are hallelujah if i'm being attacked by the demons of hell it shows me whose side i'm on they can rob my health they can rob my strength but they can never take that which was deposited before the foundation of the world i have to tell you satan god got the got to me before you ever got to me [Applause] before sin could get me god got me before the devil got me predestination got me hallelujah oh the blood will never lose its power well look at the attack brother andrew yeah look at it look at what the jury what the bride is going through look at what we're facing we've never faced anything like we're facing look at the ministry look at the ministry that ought to show you what side is right but still people want to hold on hold on hold on to the world it's so great i just gotta go back let me tell you ain't nothing out there we're going back to i've done been a part of all kinds of things out there and there's not one thing out there that i would give up there's not one thing out there that i would give up this eternal life for i know where a bottle leads you i know where women lead you i know where drugs lead you but i know where the holy ghost leads me it'll lead me to higher planes it'll lead me to deliverance it'll lead me to my children getting filled with the baptism of the holy ghost it'll lead me to healing it'll lead me to miracles it'll lead me to an overcoming church mourning is coming hallelujah you look at some people and they go into a battle man they get wrecked up but there's some people i know that go into a battle and that's when they really show their colors they were built for a battle what is it they've got a whole armor on and it seems like that there's some people i'm very acquainted with that when the battle gets hot and the battle gets rough they get better there's some people to take them back take a hit in the mouth and man it'll knock him out cold but then some people can take a knocking and they just keep on rocking as it's a people i'm acquainted with and i'd say i dared say she's the bride of jesus christ that it seems like when the battle gets so hot and so rough that it really shows out who she really is it shows out you know there's some people that don't know how to fight and there's some people that look it just looks like the battle's looking for him and there's some people that when they are in the midst of a fight man do they shine man they pull out moves the jackie chan didn't know nothing about they pulled out moves that had to come from a headship you see there are people that when the battle and when the fight gets worse they get better you look at the children of god and every time you look at the battles throughout the old testament you look at them unless sin was in the camp then they would get in trouble but you look at the people of god and when they would get in the midst of a fight then they got better they didn't grow weaker they grew stronger and you look out upon people like today let's just call one let's call jonathan dameron that when the fight gets hot and when the fight gets rough he gets better at it let me call one you're all acquainted with when you look at ron spencer and when the battle gets rough it looks like ron spencer says hold up a minute you to mess with the wrong child now [Applause] to me when you're all alone and when you're in the fight is when you truly show your colors and where you are your best now to me to me jesus was good when he healed the widow name son to me jesus was good when he walked down to lazarus and he raised him from the dead he was good when he walked down to jerius's house and he raised up a dead lady he was good when he healed the lepers but to me when jesus was at his best when he walked into the garden of gethsemane and he said not my will but thy will be done and he climbed up calvary's hill i'd say that's when jesus was at his best i'd say that there's a people that will overcome laodicea and they will do it at their best let's stand hallelujah all the disciples were shook up because they had lost the messiah they'd seen him do the work that only the messiah could do they seen him when he was hanging on a cross they seen him as he climbed that mountain they seen him as he died they seen him as they put him in a grave but jesus knew that morning was coming i will tell you you can put us in a lion's den and we'll see you in the morning i want to tell you you could put us into a valley where we're outnumbered and we'll come out i want to tell you you can put our leader in a grave you can kill him you can wrap him you can put spices on him but morning's coming you can cry all you want to but morning is coming god ain't looking for some backwards some backwards christian he's looking for somebody that's full of power and courage he's looking for somebody that's not willing to knock down to what the devil's got to say so you can throw me into a lion's den and you can put torment all around me but i know morning is coming the disciples were put in a cave for 10 days and they were scared they were cowards they was hiding from the public brother branham said that when that quickening power came there was a bravery that come on the inside of them like the line of a tribe of judah that was on the inside of them and they busted out they busted out so it shows me that you can try to lock us up you can try to scare us into the darkness but when the quickening power comes we're busting out i don't got 52 sermons tonight busting out may be my next sermon oh hallelujah you can put us in a jail but we're busting the house house of hell give way in the name of jesus hallelujah you can go through darkness but morning is coming around hallelujah you got one one more minute let me give you let me give you this quote and shalom the prophet said i say to the church shalom god's peace peace every true hebrew when he meets another one shalom other words good morning god be with you god's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's a breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing amongst us shalom peace hallelujah shalom when we see darkness setting darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging yonder to introduce the coming sun it's that when the morning star shines it's going between it's always darkest just a few minutes before the day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him amongst us his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky and when the roll is caught up yonder i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there shalom good morning peace peace be unto you sure it's darkness all around but mourning is coming oh look at your neighbor and say shalom good morning peace and good morning i love when the sun begins to rise especially during the spring and summer hours you look out upon the dew that dew begins to shine and it begins to move up and forth on blades of grass by the gym and it's a beautiful picture you see that dew realizes that the sun has risen upon it and it's getting ready to go back to where it's been before you see that dew has been there and it knows where it's going and you that have been baptized with the holy ghost you realize that you didn't come from this world you're going back to where you came from satan mourning is coming o king i'll see you in the morning my

one like our god there's no one that could promise us that when we get in the midst of a chaotic problem that they'll be there but you father we can lose sight of our friends and lose sight of our loved ones but you're always there lord i pray that we would fix our eyes upon the sun that has risen in this evening hour lord jesus you have lifted us above all of this busyness of life and the chaos of laodicea may we not fix our eyes on the problems around us but may we fix our eyes on the one that could fix all the problems god there's going to be some things that we can't handle but when we can't handle it may we freely give them to a god that can't handle it our scars that we so easily want to cover and pull down the sleeve as it were god you've seen them before we ever begin to get in a bruising situation where the enemy would abuse us and afflict us father god you have called us unto a perfectness a purity in holiness that we would not be scarred up by the things of the world but we would stand before you blameless without blemish holy and pure justified in your sight as if we've never done it father may we forgive ourselves may we forgive one another may we forgive our past lord jesus i don't know why you want me to say those things but father may they know that there is power in the blood to forgive themselves and forgive all of their evil acts and doings and if you have forgiven us we should look on ourselves as forgiven father we may look at ourselves and see ourselves as unworthy not qualified not good enough but may we turn our eyes to the fixing point of thy word that is said that you have made us worthy we stand in this moment as the redeemed bride of jesus christ and what the enemy has charged against us we throw those charges against him father your word says forgiven so we speak forgiven your word says grace we say grace your word has told us that your blood is perfect so we will believe in a perfect blood lord jesus your word says we can be healed so we're going to believe that we can be healed your word says that you have miracle working power and you change not so we will stay with what the word says father when we don't feel like saying it may we still continue to say it i hear a prophet telling us say it to your believer say it to your believer father lord jesus may we walk out of this place saying what your word says and not saying what we feel nor in our emotions but what you have deposited god we love you tonight we express our gratitude to you lord jesus we love you we love you we love you with all our hearts we bless the name of jesus go to praising him children do you love him do you love him you can believe you're free or not but you're free amen you can believe it or not but you're free when abraham lincoln signed it when he signed the declaration every one of them was free there's a lot of people that don't want to talk about that today and they want to forget their history but they're forgetting their freedom and if you begin to forget your freedom you forget what you were what's locking you up i don't know about you but i can never forget the freedom of christ and i can never forget what he got me out of when people want to turn down history and turn down everything else do not forget where he got you from he freed you from the pit of hell those slaves knew that morning was coming they climbed the hill they climbed all the way up that hill and they were waiting for this under rise they waited up all night long because they knew morning was coming hallelujah he has set you free you can be free you can be free in your worship i don't know what it's about but tonight's about your freedom and when you come here in the morning you can worship from a spot of freedom you can worship from a spot of forgiveness you can worship from a spot of justified now that is what shakes down god richly bless you tonight we'll see you in the morning and let us worship from a space of freedom do you love the lord tonight children how many is going to remember your pastor in the morning amen give the lord a prayer hand clapping praises [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when i'm feeling afraid you're dismissed in the name of the world full of uncertainties when the plans that are made fall apart [Music] there is a promise
