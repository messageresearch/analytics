come and Lord you receive that praise father Lord because the Bible tells us Lord that you inhabit it you inhabit Our Praise father and Lord if there's one thing that we're built to do in this life it's to praise the Living God father you see these hands that are lifted up father their needs Lord some are sick some have little little things in their life father that he need you to touch father and Lord I would ask Lord Jesus Lord that that before they begin to see it take place in their life may they thank you for it may they praise you for it father Lord as we submit ourselves into the hands of the Mighty God here tonight we invite you father the one that wrote the word in the very beginning to come and begin to take our heart hearts Lord and transition us into Faith father Faith to

get before the pool of the people that things may not come together how we thought but Lord I believe that if you can get in it here tonight Lord I believe that this will be just more than a Saturday night meeting but I believe that this could be a convention with Jesus a conference with you father Lord and I believe that you can call it to a halt in our lives things that the enemy might be doing

and you've never left me and you've never forsake for Aken me so Father Here I Am one more time Use Me For Your Glory so God we submit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening would' like to look over in the Book of Revelations chapter 5 Revelations chapter 5 say praise the Lord everybody amen and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on a on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice Voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I be beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God it sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and a golden vials full of odors which which are the prayers of saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10 thousands times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on Earth and under the Earth such as are in the sea and all things that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and under the lamb forever and ever and the 4 be said amen and the 4 and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever may God bless his word he may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on a thought that I spoke to you many months ago that I was going to be speaking at some time but I would like to speak to you um on a thought here this weekend on the reason a reason to Rejoice a reason to rejoice and I believe that if anybody has a reason to Rejoice I believe that it is the Lamb's wife and I believe that we set here in a very special spot here tonight recognizing that we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God and it it's a wonderful privilege to know that you can serve him without bounds and you can serve him without without any chains and things that are upon your life but we sit here tonight and we recognize that by the preaching of the word that God has established us as Sons and Daughters of God and built us in a way that only that only we as Sons and Daughters of God can worship like we do now the Bible says here in 1 Thessalonians 5 and 16 Rejoice ever more it isn't it doesn't give us an option it doesn't give us it doesn't give us a time for our opinion or a slot of time but it says forever more it doesn't matter what time it is whether it's morning noon or night it says Rejoice ever more and we realize that right here in this week that we are sitting here in the United States that we recog I that this is our time of Thanksgiving here in the Americas we're reminded that our nation was was was founded upon Christian principles how that the pilgrims came here many many years ago and and made the Americas their home they came here and they were seeking after a a a freedom of religion and after a certain time and after a certain season of harvest they begin to have a time where they would call it Thanksgiving and it didn't just last for one day or for a certain season but it actually the first Thanksgiving here in the Americas lasted for 3 days and now we recognize it as a national holiday but I believe that as Christians that Thanksgiving isn't just a day on our calendar but I believe that it is a way of life for Christians that we ought to give thanks every day it's something that that we reflect upon the blessings that God has bestowed upon us I believe that we've got something to be thankful for and as we begin to reflect upon these things and I believe that is why God allowed us a a certain time to be able to speak this thought here tonight is because of the time that we're in and I believe that we can speak things on certain moments that we're in and I believe that it that it's more effective in certain times and that's how God does things because it captures the mind of his people it's like it's like preaching it's like preaching the Christmas message it's like preaching a Christmas message necessarily on a on a certain day it doesn't necessarily have the effect as it was as it would if it was on on a different day or on Christmas Day it has a greater effect and this weekend we begin to reflect and think about the God that has blessed every single one of our lives and I believe that as we begin to reflect upon these things and I believe that that that you sat down with your family this week and you begin to sit down and begin to set and count all of your blessings and I believe that if we could sit here tonight and begin to count all of our blessings that time would fail us of how many times that we've been blessed just in this past week and you begin to reflect about the goodness and the mercy of almighty God it'll it'll put something on the inside of your heart that'll make you want to thank God from the depths of your soul begin to express the Gratitude and I believe that even if you don't have two nickels to rub together in your own name I believe that you still got something that you can still thank God for because God has given you the the very breath in your lungs he's given you the god that'll that'll always be you a God that that that'll never let down on on any of his promises I believe that it doesn't matter what name you are under it doesn't matter what situation that you come from whether you're a Believer or a non-believer I believe that you ought to still be able to lift your head to the higher power and recognize that there is a God that has always been watching over you all the days of your life he's predestinated moments like these moments that you're in to set up a moment so that you could give back thanks to the god that gave you everything that you ever had in this life and I think that if we as the children of the most high God begin to recognize how great our God is I believe that we can sit here and say that we've got a reason to Rejoice the Bible said in Philippians 4:4 rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice I believe that it's a privilege I believe it's a privilege as of Christians to be able to do this is to Rejoice at all times if if you begin to look what what the Philippian letter says he also tells us in Philippians 3 to rejoice in the Lord but he comes back again in in verse in chapter 4 and tells us again rejoice in the Lord I believe that doesn't matter the circumstance or the situation that you're in that you ought to be able to rejoice and I know there's a million ways that we could take this thought here this weekend but I want to take a a certain or direct thought here this weekend notice what the Bible says in Psalms 106 praise ye the Lord oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all of his praise if you look and study out the Bible that particular phrase is mentioned over nine times throughout the Bible oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good Psalms 107 oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so who whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy Psalms 136 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever oh give thanks to the Lord of hosts for his mercy endureth forever to him who alone doeth great works and wonders for his mercy endureth forever and I believe unto our God belongs all graise as we sat here as the redeemed of the lord we have come back like the one leper that had returned when the other nine went on their way there was one that turned around and recognized that healing had came to his body and he went back and he returned and he gave thanks when he recognized that the one that had healed him and the one that had saved him from this this condition or this disease that is a type of sin he returned and he gave thanks and I believe that there's no way that that you can never thank God enough I believe that there's no way that you can praise God enough I don't believe that there's no way that you can make too much out of my God I believe that the higher you build him up the more you got to do it I believe that the more that you praise him the more you're required to praise him and I believe that that you'll never put too much on my God you can brag on certain people and you'll build them up and they'll let you down but I believe that you can brag on my Jesus and my Jesus will never let you down you can talk about healing and he'll show up with healing you can talk about deliverance and he'll show up with Deliverance you can talk about manifestations of Sons and Daughters of God and he will show up and he will show out that's the kind of God that I know and that I serve it's like that Christian woman science woman one time that Christian Science woman had told William brandom said now look he said she said you're putting too much emphasis on that Jesus if I found one one fault in your ministry that you brag too much on Jesus that's the kind of fault that I'd like to have in my Ministry is that I brag too much on Jesus he said how in the world do I brag too much on Jesus she said well you make him Divine he said well he was divine he was divine she said well I can show you by your Bible that God that he was not Divine I can show you that he was a man see he said all right show me that she said just look one time when he went down there to the tomb of Lazarus and there he be to weep she said see he was a man he said I'll go with you yes he was a man when he was crying over Lazarus he said but he showed up as a God when he said Lazarus come forth I can tell you right now you can brag about a God that raises Congressman Upshaw and I'll tell you that he's the same kind of a god that'll show up one of these mornings and touch our brother Charles and he'll walk out of a wheelchair completely whole if William Bram said it in the fourth seal and he said it in the fifth seal that one of these days we'll watch missing limbs come back on I believe that this is the hour come on somebody we ain't talking about squirrels and we ain't talking about little fishes we're talking about Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah hallelujah ain't nobody like my God and I believe that's a reason why we have a reason to Rejoice cuz there's no God like my God for the Bible said in Isaiah 40 and2 who ha measured the waters in the hollow of his hands and Meed out heaven with a span and comprehended the dust of the Earth in a measure and weighed the mountains and scales and and the heels in the balance who have directed The Spirit of the Lord or or being his counsel counselor hath taught him tell me who can direct god with whom took he coun coun tell me did he take counsel with Joe Biden did he take counsel with the Pope or did he take counsel with Putin who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed him the way of understanding behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket now I believe that me and me and Isaiah could have been Chums because I understand his language right there because you drop one little little little drop of water into a bucket you can't see it in there and here Isaiah saying that the the nations are as a drop of a bucket so that their power is completely inadequate according to the power of the most high God and are counted as small dust of the balance behold he take it up the aisles as a very little thing and Lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the Beast thereof sufficient for a burnt offering All Nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing in vanity to whom to whom then will you liken God or what likeness will you compare unto him Paul said in Colossians 1 and 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth and visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist by him all things are held together I want to say this to you tonight there is no power that can rival or can match up to my God here tonight there's no demon that can thwart him there's no cancer that can conquer him he controls all and he knows all let me go further here tonight he's never went too far in his mercy and thought now you know what I've went too far of my Mercy that my children will think I'm too big of a merciful god and they won't respect me I believe that God's never went too far with his mercy and I believe if you're running away from this kind of a God I believe that he's got Mercy that's in front of you he's not the kind of God that's changing his mind about you or all of his promises he's a God that understands all things let me tell you he's God in heaven and he's God here on Earth but let me bring it down just a little bit further he's God in hell as well there is nothing that is getting past almighty God all of Hell's plans will never be able to stop almighty God let me tell you Muhammad all of their religions they don't have a reason to Rejoice like you got Buddha does not have a reason to Rejoice like you got here tonight their God still sitting there in a tomb with dry bones but my God my God spoke to Lazarus and he got up out of the grave my God spoke out of the mouth of Isaiah and there a virgin can did conceive my God spoke out of Joel and said that in the last days I will pour out my spirit and my God said AR raas me I will raise myself up on the third day you can look across the Eastern Sea you can look out there and it's a sign to you tonight there's an empty tomb out there Hallelujah can I give you some reasons to Rejoice here tonight the God we're serving as a living God he's so

president I still believe you ought to be able to Rejoice I don't care if you're the governor I still believe that you ought to be able to Rejoice come on somebody I don't care if you're a starchy lawyer or a starchy doctor or a starchy teacher I still believe that there ought to be somebody that could magnify the Lord with me if the Bible said Rejoice ever more I believe it doesn't matter what your last name is it doesn't matter the family that you came out of it do matter how bad a situation that you're in whether the doctor diagnosed you with a terminally ill cancer I believe you still ought to be able to Rejoice well go ahead and do it one time I believe you like yourself better go ahead it ain't going to hurt God and it ain't going to hurt me come on somebody you praise your

God ain't backing up my God ain't giving up come on somebody cancer don't scare my God Co didn't scare my God sugar diabetes didn't scare my my God you can't scare an unscareable God hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah come on brother Bill's got something to thank the Lord about God saved him from that H Moore that mother condition that he was in back there saved him out of that Catholicism he's got a right to praise [Applause] him do I have to start calling out your name and let you point out all the things that you got a reason to Rejoice about come on somebody what about brother Clarence when he was in a F an accident and then God saved his leg I'd say he's got a reason to Rejoice how about you brother Randall when the old a hope would been give upon you but God never gave upon [Applause] you you getting what I'm saying you got a reason you got a reason and if you can only come up with one he's so much God that he saved little bitty old me remember brother bar would talk about that about that sister she got saved she said I want to thank the Lord I ain't what I want to be and I ain't what I need to be but thank God I ain't what I used to be brother brandom said that she knew that had she had been somewhere but now she was somewhere different you see God had a reason in Saving you God had a reason God had a reason in coming by your way God had a reason brother bandam said he said he gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in Saving me he said he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he said he had a reason to save you he said look at the millions that he that he could have took beside you but he took you but he took you and let me say this let me just go go right here and beat down that thought of of people's mind their mind ideas on on Election that it was not your choice that God chose you over he didn't look down the eons of time and look upon you and say well I see them out there 6,000 years later and they chose me so I chose them let me tell you my God is not that kind of a carnal God he's not that carnal to make a choice over your choice because I can tell you about my choice my choice led me to some dark alleys my choice led me looking at the end of a bottle sometime my choice my choice put me in a bad condition but his choice his choice his election his predestination I'll say it like this God sent himself on the inside of me that's why he saved me well was it it's like what William brandom said and it is the rising of the sun he said when God when he looked out there upon the atmosphere of that of that dark dismal atmosphere out there he said he looked out there and he said he spoke a word said let there be light William brandham said he had a reason in doing that he said because God knew that there was seeds all the way down there underneath underneath all that muck underneath all that water God had a reason in saying let there be light and God's Got A Reason in in letting the evening light pass over your soul brother Denny because God had seen that before the foundation of the world that there was a genan seed of God a part of himself deposited on the inside of you and God doesn't just do things to say that he does it he moves with a purpose it's like in Mark Mark 16 he said let these signs these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover William brandham said in things that are to be he said it has to be that way he said he wouldn't have said it unless there's going to be somebody that could catch that word there's going to be somebody that's going to receive that and catch that word he didn't never spoke it if there wasn't somebody that was on the other end calling for that deep is that right so there had to be somebody that was looking for Mark 16 how many ever played a little baseball and you was out in the Outfield and you caught a you caught a Fly ball I highly doubt that you ever caught a Fly ball just sticking your glove up and not looking for it when it was a line drive but it was coming that way is the reason that you caught it it was coming by the way of the air is the reason why you was looking for it and you stuck your glove up and you caught it come on somebody I know I'm talking to you bun of I know I'm talking to you here tonight so God seen you all the way down here and he's seen you with your hands up he's seen you with your soul lifted up to him and he saw somebody that was looking for the manifestation of the sons of God so he looked in there and saw somebody saw somebody that seen Mark 16 as the word of this hour I got my glove up let me tell you God is sending a word by your way and your Shore as a jeans sheit of God to catch it come on somebody what did Brother brandham say to had he said exactly what she said was nothing but the truth what was it she had her hand up she was ready to catch it H blessed be the name of the lord it's kind of like the atmosphere that's created right here this evening it's it's kind of like that same atmosphere here tonight I don't believe that we're sitting around a table that you have in your office but I believe we're sitting around the Lord's table I believe that we are creating an atmosphere where the Holy Ghost can drop into this room and someone can catch the Word of Promise and manifest that promise and watch it come to pass you watch you watch about every patient that William brandham ever dealt with matter of fact you can go back in Jesus's Ministry and go all the way back there doesn't it doesn't matter when you can hear it on tape when William Brandon whether he saw a vision or he simply laid his hand upon a patient and he prayed over them the prayer faith and he would say now go on your road rejoicing why was it maybe they didn't feel it maybe they didn't see it but if you can believe it if you can start thanking God for it because you are put here with a purpose to be able to praise God your entire purpose is to praise the almighty God and it doesn't matter the problems that you are in or under I believe that you still ought to be able to praise the almighty God I don't know how in the world you could be down while you're praising almighty God I believe that if you're still contemplating on your problems and your situations while you're praising God you're not doing it right come on somebody I hope you heard what I said I believe that if you're still contemplating on your problems and your and your situations and you're praising God at the same time then you're not doing it right but if you're doing it right if you're doing it right you can lose sight of everything that is happening down here because you lost your sight to Earthbound chickens and Earthbound squirrels because you're an [Music] eagle William brandham said when he was talking about that ego Affair at time when he was up there hunting in them Hills that he got up there and he seen that eagle up there and he noticed the chattering of that squirrel down there I hope it's all right I'm following inspiration but he but he said he said he said I got to watch on that eagle and he thought why is that eagle so so brave up there why is he so brave up there don't he know I could shoot him don't he know I could take him out in a matter of seconds even though he wouldn't have he said but why is he so brave he said but then I got to Noti in something that eagle trusted he trusted in the power of his wings now if that eagle could trust all of his power and be so brave he could trust his wings how much more as Sons and Daughters of God should we be able to trust oursel being filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost one time William brandom said he said the reason why that eag went up that high the reason why it was up that high is because he was built for and the reason why you are looking through the lens of the message is because you're built to see come on somebody You're Not Looking Through The Eyes of mortal men you're looking through the eyes of a prophet here tonight what the angel say to you the higher you go the more you see what is this Eagle age that we are under the higher we go in Revelation the more we see God never would have built that eagle that way if he didn't have some inspiration to get underneath of him and to go up there he would have had no reason to go up there but God built him that way there's a reason why the Church of Christ can't fly where your fly they ain't got no reason to be there but you got a reason sister [Applause] Charlene I hope you hear me talking to you tonight I got a reason to preach what I'm preaching here tonight I got a reason to talk like I'm talking because I know in whom I have believe and he called me by my name is that all right feels all right up here William brandom said he said look at old Simeon har he was 80 years old he had a fine reputation certainly he was an old sage and a renowned man had a fine reputation amongst the people and now he said the Holy Ghost had promised him that he wasn't going to see death until he seen the Lord's Christ William brandom said he had a good reason to testify about it let me tell you something if the Lord had revealed to me that I'm not going to die until I see the Lord's Christ forgive me I'm just probably a little bit too much redhead I can't die like you dying he had a good reason to testify like he was testifying because the Holy Ghost had spoke to him brother Timothy and told him you're not going to taste death until you see the Lord's Crist well I believe that you've got as much testimony as Simeon got because there's going to be somebody in this generation that's promised that they're not going to taste death there's a Rapture that as you go there's a body change that's in front of [Applause] you well if Simeon had a good reason to testify about it I believe that you got a reason to Rejoice about it you're the King's son Hallelujah now notice what the Bible says in First Kings 1:39 and zadok the priest took a hornet of oil Horn of oil out of the Tabernacle anointed Solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said God saved King Solomon and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with a great joy so that the Earth rent with the sound of him y'all read what I read that men were praising and rejoicing over a natural King now if the Earth could rent and be rocked by the praise of a natural King how much more about when King Jesus shows up in here I believe that you ought to rock this place tonight I'm talking about a real Rock concert I'm talking about a real Rock and Roll concert where we rock the singles off of this place and holy rollers roll through this place praising almighty God if they can praise and thank God for a natural King that was raised up after King David how much more should we praise the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I'm building this and I hope it's okay I ain't got no timer set and I know that scares some people but there's an internal timer that I'm not going off until until the angel comes here tonight but I believe that there are angels that are here tonight I don't believe they're watching watching you worship when you begin to read Isaiah chapter 6 when you begin to see the vision that is transporting that transport Isaiah and he looks up there he looks up there and he sees the Angels the heropants those angels that are of a higher order flying with two Wings covering their face worshiping worshiping praising God singing holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty and the Bible said that at the voice of one angel that It Rock the post of the temple one Angel did that one Angel did that by his worship saying holy holy holy is the Lord could you imagine God's got millions of angels but could you imagine the influence of Angel angelology tonight here if there's demonology surely there's angelology as well so imagine if one shook the temple and rocked that place could you imagine Millions here tonight but let me drop it down to you ain't none of them can worship like you [Applause] worship there ain't one angel that understands Amazing Grace like a son that was lost in sin that was lost in hell that was lost in a dop at condition that was lost in a pornography condition let me tell you something I've been serving Jesus I've been a Christian I've been in a Christian home my whole life but I've been a Christian a Christian for 15 years and I had people say well you're you're going to serve God like that why while you're young let me tell you I did this 15 years ago and I ain't found a new convert in Jesus Christ that can out worship me I like to see somebody try one time I like find I actually I actually had a dream about your pastor brother Wayne the other night me and him was I told my wife I woke up I had one of the best dreams I don't know where I was but me and brother Wayne was cutting a rug I can do it too if you want me to but I won't do it I won't do it just yet because I got something else to say I ain't found a new convert that out worship me I definitely ain't going to let no angel out worship me a new confort where it's fresh to them how rich in Mercy are God is I can tell you right now I ain't never going to let no angel while worship me and I ain't never going to let no Rock cry in my place if as long as there's breath in my lungs I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to worship I'm going to praise now notice those angels I believe that every son and daughter of God be ought to be able to recognize the protection that they're under here tonight because not only are those angels Built To Worship but they're built to protect because there's a reference in the Bible that we offer offer often oftenly reference here in Full Gospel Lighthouse it's in First Kings 19-35 where the Bible tells us that when Hezekiah prayed that one Angel showed up and killed 185 a th000 syrians one Angel showed up let me tell you God's got millions of angels in heaven he's got corridors of Heaven he's got different leagues of angels in heaven and the Bible said that Jesus would tell us that our Angels our angels are constantly beholding our face before the father that's what William Brandon would tell us that every person has a guardian angel according to scripture not a think about this in Psalms 991 that the Bible tells us that angels are set to keep charge over you if you look at it in the right way there are angels plural and there's you singular there are angels that are built to protect you come on somebody when the car W happened right in front of you what was it Angels stood up for you I believe that ought that ought to give you a reason to Rejoice because it ought to allow you to see how valuable that you are to almighty God that he's got angels that are protecting you now let me get on my subject or y'all going to hang me the Bible said the Bible said in Amos chapter 3 and 4 please don't do it I don't like that idea the Bible said Amos 3 and 4 will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no pre notice what brother Brandon says he said the lion is roaring for a reason he said does a lion roar now without a reason does a young lion cry out of the Crave before he takes anything when when he hath no pray will a young lion cry out of his den if he taketh nothing so God has a reason and holding the Revelation for this hour because the Bible said in Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret under his servants of Prophets The Lion hath roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken but who can but prophesy brother random said he's roaring now he's roaring by his Vindicated word when he Roars forth then something follows that Roar yes because he's coming forth then he said God has got a reason to Roar because he knows that judgment is at hand his word his word is a prophet he is this is the prophecy of Jesus Christ it's a revelation God revealing himself to us through his written word and he is the word now notice that the Bible says in Isaiah 55 7-1 that God's word will not return void unto him but his thoughts are higher than our thoughts so God has a reason God has a reason and dispatching the seventh angel in this hour he's got a reason in the seventh angel standing there and standing there proclaiming we've probed at it for so long we've looked at it for so long but now it's open what is it the line is roaring notice what he says in the breach he said now watch real close this is something you must get he said now he had been doing his mediat work making intercessions for the believer for 2,000 years he'd been back there a lamb now he's stepping forth from eternity to take the title deed book and to break the seals and to reveal the Mysteries let me say this to you this is not young people this is not a hoof lamb this is not a woolly lamb that is coming up and taking a book with his hoofs out of the right hand of almighty God but this was a man this was a sacrifice of Calvary this is the one that was beaten the one that was battered when John saw him it looked like he'd been in battle he had blood all over him because he'd been in a war he'd been in a war what was in a war over you he was in a war over you and he overcame and he overcame he was not going to let pilot win he was not going to let Rome win he was not going to let Herod win Hallelujah he was not going to let the son of predition win he was in battle because he thought that you was worth saving millions and millions of lambs had been slain under the old order but none of them had the power to wash away the sins of the most innocent sinner much less the most guilty it only had the ability to cover sin but this lamb [Music] this lamb this lamb thought that je was worth dying for when he was up there in the Garden of Gethsemane and he was praying father not my will but thy will be done William brandham said that is where the greatest victory was won right there in the Garden of Gethsemane when he surrendered his own will it's the same way with every single one of you sitting here tonight it's where the greatest battle was fought right here and your mind when you surrender your will watch watch what the lamb does in Revelations 5 he said no one could do it he walks right up to the right hand of God and took the book out of his hand and claimed his rights can I put this in red letter for you I have died for them I am their kinsman redeemer I am the mediator my blood was shed I have become man I did this in order to get that church back again the one that I foresaw before the foundation of the world I have purposed it I spoke that it would be there and nobody was able to take it but I went down and done it myself I am their Kinsmen I became kin folks to them and they took the book what is it what's so precious about this book of life it's got your name on it why was John weeping in Revelations 5 because John looked over there and he saw his name he saw his name on the book and when he seen that all of Heaven had been searched over and there was nobody found worthy in heaven nobody found worthy on the earth nobody below the Earth that was found worthy to take the book but there was somebody that spoke up and said weep not John for the lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and when John turned around what did he see not a lion but a lamb hallelujah what do you need most right now a lamb of Mercy a lamb that washes you it was that precious blood that you're bought with let me tell you you sometimes you go shopping and you buy something you get that thing called buyers remorse especially when you take it back to the place that you bought it and they said we're not accepting that back and then you got to learn to love it laugh all you want to wait till December 26th I guess I'm just going to have to learn to love this piece of art I guess that's what you call that you get that bar you y'all act like you know what I'm talking about just wait just wait a year regift it they'll never remember that they gave it to you but you get that buyers don't try that don't take your pastor's advice right there that will get you in trouble I don't know but I think it would never tried that have I uh but God has never had buyers remorse when he bought you he never one time thought you know what I need to return them I I need to take them back I guess I just have to learn to love them like they are no when God bought you he thought that you was worth dying for before the world began and he saw the lamb slain come on somebody come on somebody God thought enough of me that he couldn't return [Applause] me what is it the Lamb's got a hold of you he has the title deed to Redemption he has it in his hand mediation is done now he has it in his hand remember it's been in the hand of God all that time but now it's in the hand of the Lamb watch the tital deed of redemption of all creation is in his hand and he's come to claim it back for the human race not to claim it back for Angels when I read this I about tore tore something up he said but to claim it back to the human which it was given for to make Sons and Daughters of God again what is it all creation has been groaning for this hour for this hour for this moment of the manifestations of sons of God to bring them back to the Garden of Eden everything that they lost the whole creation the trees the animal life everything else oh my don't that make you feel good what's redemption mean it means that God took you out of the pawn shop he took you out of the pawn shop he thought of you he bought you and the only thing that you have got to recognize is that you're free I know that you're [Applause] free how many times do Satan put those chains on your mind how many times has he put it there and battle you that you're not a good Mama that you're not a good Christian that you're not the only thing these are words of a prophet here you already free the only thing you have to do is know about it let me tell you Johnny Crow you are already free let me say it like this Freedom isn't free but it's paid for it's paid for come on hat R them sons are already prayed for come on meet to brandom them tumors already been spok come on come on little fishy it's already paid for come on speak to them storms it's already paid for come on it ain't free but it's paid for oh I wish somebody could Rejoice here tonight because you look in Revelations chapter 5 and the book is closed but in Revelations chapter 10 and I saw another mighty Angel glow with a cloud with a rainbow above his [Applause] head and he had in his hand can anybody tell me what he had in his hand a little book open a little book open let me tell you something when you want to give somebody something you don't hand it to them with your foot you give it to him with your hand and it was in the hand of almighty god well come on John take the book John eat the book John it's open John you're a manifested son and daughter of God it's open to you John it's paid for your battles are over come on now come on now what is it and he had his foot on the land and he had his foot on the sea and his feet was as a pillars of fire what is it your feet are his feet what is it come on now the lamb was taking his position what do you look in Revelations in Revelations chapter 10 and you see Christ standing up you look in Revelation or you look in Daniel chapter 12 and you see the mighty Angel Michael standing up what is it Daniel 12 and Revelations chap 10 are exactly the same but one is true the je and one is to the Gentiles and this is your hour let me say this to you the lamb is in his position Malachi 4 is in his position Revelations 10:7 is in his position but the Bride of Jesus Christ is in her position hallelujah hallelujah when you was on your way to a devil's hell there was somebody with a book of redemption in his hand said I'm claiming that one I'm claiming Jordan Martin I'm claiming Rachel Snider I'm claiming [Applause] [Music] Thomas I came for her I came for him it's paid for stop beating yourself you got a reason to rejoice you ain't got to Die the lamb died for [Applause] you hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah what is this book of redemption this title deed abstract deed you say abstract what does that abstract mean it means it searchs all the way back to the beginning like that little drop of incus morning morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ oh my it gives you an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of Almighty it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve oh my what ought that to do to a born again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract title deed of eternal life means that you possess everything somebody say everything that Adam and Eve lost woo what of it Brethren the possession of that deed I want you to take it and make an acknowledgement here tonight that your enemy is expecting you to be defeated it but if I was you I'd wave my token in front of him and I'd show him this is no trespassing zone right here take your dirty hands off of God's Property I once was your property but no longer am I your property I look like your property but I ain't your property I look like I had your seal but I got a different seal William bam said that devil can't do anything with a son and daughter of God that's sealed with the Holy Ghost he said that devil can Buzz at it and fuss at it he said but he can never get near that seal don't touch it don't touch it don't touch it let me put it to you like this devil take your hands off of Ron Spencer let me put it to you I kiss take your hands off of Francis lamb come on take your hands off of them they're mine I died for them I paid for them they're mine if I was you I'd call your name the lamb paid for me the lamb thought I was worth dying then you got a reason a reason just one reason to [Applause] rejoice how long I've been too long or not long enough might have heard both there I a sure but Satan will never get you I like that forgive me I they put me in a fullback position when I was a junior yeah I was behind that guy trying to run he was the only guy could run behind cuz he was only one thought if I don't step up for him he's going to get killed but I would have loved to have that power as a fullback and just take the ball take off running have that power of a stiff arm before they ever get to you you know what I'm saying Can't Touch This Lord help me you got me in this get me out of it Lord I got scripture to back up what I'm talking about here tonight not necessarily about the Heisman right there but I got scripture talking about that the devil can't get a hold of me because the Bible said in Revelation chapter 17 let me move on to something spiritual Revelation chapter 17 says that the shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is the Lord of lords and the king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful now I don't know about you but that makes me want to shout right there the ain't with him Kings and potentates ain't with him Rome ain't with him the church World ain't with him politics ain't with him but they that are called and they that are chosen and they that are faithful are with him I'm with the lamb the pope ain't with him hell ain't with him but I I may not have been faithful all my life but I was chosen I may have not been faithful all my life but I was called so it makes me faithful that ought to give you enough reason right there to shake those singles off of this place I was seen with him in the Lamb's Book of [Applause] Life That's My Destiny don't touch it Lord help me this is too much fun if y'all if it's your first night here I'm always like this I'm sorry Dad will clean it up tomorrow that's all right the politician will show up it's okay if I go just a little bit longer I ain't going to tell you how long I'm going to go because that'll make a liar out of me I can't stand it when the preacher said I'm going to go 18 more minutes and then they go 85 more minutes so I'm not going to tell you how long I'm going to go I'm just going to go till I'm finished but if Christ the lamb I believe brother Vernon is with me if Christ the lamb is in heaven has taken a book to claim his Redemption rights then I believe the counterpart his wife his shadow on Earth must move on Earth and do the same thing we must take the book we must eat the book and we must go out and claim our Redemption rights come on Joshua come on Joshua Christ just setting his feet as pillars of fire on the earth come on Joshua come on Joshua that's my family that's my inheritance that's my promise that's my holy ghost that that's my pastor that's my health come on Joshua it's your land it's a good land you already been there Joshua come on let the rest rest of them 10 spies say what they want to but as for me in my house I know it's a good land I know it's a land that's FL with milk and honey and I'll say it like King David said it before he was a King when he was facing one of the greatest obstacles that he'd ever come up against when he was facing Goliath he said this day this day you're going to Bow before me and I'm going to feed you and all the host of the Philistines to the foul of the air that all of Israel might know that there is a God in Israel come on Joshua come on Joshua come on Joshua they've been staring they've been staring at you and they've been running their mouth at you but it's time that you start claiming your god-given privileges I do not believe that God is up in heaven giving out permiss Mission just to every demon in hell to go send out cancer where they want to I do not believe that I know I was talking to a guy one time asked me how my daddy is doing I said well he's doing good doctors diagnosed him with cancer he said yeah I hear that's going around real bad like it was a cold or something you got easily can Jesus said the poor you have with you always I say it like this the ignorant you have with you always hope you don't like hope you don't get mad at my inity interpretation that's the way it said but I do not believe that God is up in heaven given every demon in Hell permission to touch his children I believe that before them demons have the ability to come out there and touch your life and try to work on you and make you doubt and make you make you fear and make you do I believe that they have to go before my father and ask him permission but I do not believe that I'm serving the kind of God that is openly openly just giving every demon in P every demon in Hell power to touch sons and daughters of God but I do believe that God has an open book and he is openly showing it to his children get rid of them demons get rid of them Philistines get rid of them amorites come on now that's your land [Applause] I'm sick and tired of watch my daddy get sick I'm sick and tired of watching him deal with cancer deal with Kemo deal with seizures I'm sick and tired of it but I've got god-given privileges here tonight I got a reason to Rejoice I'm a Son of God Satan you're not messing with just somebody you're messing with a with an Andrew an Andrew Lee Spencer that knows who he is I told brother Tim puit when I found out four years ago I tell you what that's got to baffle some people's mind right there four months turns into four years do you have a reason to Rejoice I do but I told Tim BR four years ago I told him when my dad went through the fire I was one way I was a one Angel Spencer I didn't even know really God at that time I'd heard about of God but then I seen God I was like job said I have heard but now I see I said but the difference between this trial and that trial I'm a different guy I know in whom I hath believed and I know the power that I have and I know that Satan does not have to listen to me but he has to listen to the one that I represent and I am sick and tired of Hamas and cancer trying to thwart Israel and trying to stop the Church of the Living God we are born to possess our inheritance it's my god-given privileges it's my healing it's my Miracle it's my way I got a reason to Rejoice there ain't no devil going to stop me from praising my God hallelujah don't you recognize tonight that you are disputing with a conquered enemy he has no power he's got an arrows he's got a bow but no Arrow arrows to go in it he's been stripped of his authority and all of his [Applause] power I ain't just raising my voice to get you excited I ain't talking to you about some Disney fairy tale here I'm talking about a people that have the ability to look out there and see a well body and walk right into it I believe that you've got every right to worship your way into a new bodyall William brandom said he couldn't stop John Ryan from praising God out there once he recognized that healing was for me he said I couldn't stop him said he stopped the whole service he stopped the whole service nervous to start thanking God that he was healed before he was ever healed he testified while he was selling newspapers that he couldn't even read I'm Healed and while he was sitting in a barber's chair he worshiped his way into a new body and had eyes that could see look at Georgie Carter when her uncle and ravished her and done an awful deed to her she was on her way to music lessons yeah and Satan put a complex on her and she laid in that bed for n years laid there at 47 lbs but what was the first thing that she was doing when God healed her she got up and started praising God on that piano showing that you've got power in your praise that is greater than your [Applause] complex now I'm going to come to you real quick quick I'm going come to you I'm going to find every single one of you I don't care what complex and I don't care what stigma that you are under I don't don't care what you think people think about you you got every reason to Rejoice stop thinking that that one over there thinks something about you and this one over there is jealous over you because the way that you've got things stop thinking them kind of thoughts we're one body we're one unit and the power that breaks jealousy is unity in the Church of the Living God stop thinking that that person thinks you're too loud stop thinking that well I'm

of Triumph that he'll raise you right here in the midst of lay Osa and create the greatest Escape Plan Satan thought he'd seen something when he look back over 4,000 years ago and he seen a little baby boy floating down a Nile river that was infested with crocodiles but there was an angel on that boat and was riding him all the way to Pharaoh's house God's the kind of planner that he planned it
