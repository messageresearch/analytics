[43:45] in jesus name amen amen if you have your
[43:48] bibles this evening we'd like to look
[43:49] over in psalms chapter 63 and then
[43:52] revelations chapter two
[44:16] man psalms chapter 63.
[44:29] a psalm of david when he was in the
[44:31] wilderness of judah
[44:33] oh god thou art my god
[44:36] early will i seek thee
[44:38] my soul thirsteth for thee
[44:41] my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[44:43] thirsty land
[44:44] where no water is
[44:46] to see thy power and thy glory so as i
[44:49] have seen thee in the sanctuary
[44:51] because thy loving kindness is better
[44:53] than life
[44:54] my lips shall praise thee
[44:56] thus i will bless
[44:59] thee while i live i will lift up my
[45:01] hands
[45:02] in thy name
[45:03] revelations chapter 2 and verse 7.
[45:09] notice this is
[45:10] this is in the ephesian church age but
[45:12] this is not just to the ephesian church
[45:14] age this is to every church age
[45:17] notice this reward
[45:20] to the overcomer
[45:22] amen
[45:23] let's just read it together this evening
[45:25] revelations chapter 2 and 7
[45:28] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[45:30] the spirit saith unto the churches to
[45:33] him that overcometh will i give to ede
[45:36] of the tree of life which is in the
[45:38] midst of the paradise of god may god
[45:41] bless his word you may be seated in the
[45:42] presence of the lord
[45:45] i'd like to take my my text tonight from
[45:47] this scripture
[45:49] on giving rights to the tree of life
[45:52] and if you begin to look at that that
[45:54] word give
[45:56] it has the meaning
[45:58] of grant to deliver
[46:00] to bestow and to bring forth and
[46:03] certainly we can go over and we can
[46:06] certainly begin to thank the lord for
[46:08] what he has given us in this life he's
[46:10] given us health he's given us abilities
[46:12] he's given us he's given us time he's
[46:14] given us finances he's given us one
[46:16] another he's given us a a wonderful
[46:18] church building that we can serve him
[46:20] and worship him in and there's so many
[46:22] things that we could begin to thank him
[46:24] for what he has given us in this life
[46:26] but the most precious thing that we
[46:28] could thank the lord jesus christ for is
[46:30] life itself
[46:32] the ability to know him and the power of
[46:35] his resurrection that is
[46:38] life and we could sit here and begin to
[46:40] think and reflect upon what life has
[46:42] meant to some people and what life means
[46:45] to the christian and to a christian life
[46:48] is the lord jesus christ and outside of
[46:50] the lord jesus christ there really is no
[46:53] life but we know that that that our lord
[46:56] has given us great things he has given
[46:58] us his word he has given us his power he
[47:00] has given us his spirit and the bible
[47:02] tells us that the in second in second
[47:05] timothy in 3 and 16 that all scripture
[47:08] is given if you have your bibles just
[47:10] keep them handy we'll go through some
[47:12] scriptures here this at the beginning of
[47:14] the service this evening that all
[47:16] scripture is given by inspiration of god
[47:19] and it is profitable for doctrine for
[47:21] reproof for correction for instruction
[47:24] and
[47:24] for instruction in righteousness and we
[47:26] realize that an inspiration if you go to
[47:29] studying out the word that it means the
[47:31] the breath the breath of god and and we
[47:34] realize that the bible teaches us and
[47:37] tells us that the very world that we
[47:39] live on the world was was framed by the
[47:42] very word of god and and the word of god
[47:45] is formed by god's own breath and when a
[47:49] man begins to speak it is his life's
[47:51] breath that begins to form his words and
[47:54] when god begins to speak through
[47:55] humanity it is the life of god or the
[47:58] holy ghost forming his words as that man
[48:02] or that or that minister begins to speak
[48:04] as god's holy oracle it is the very
[48:07] breath of god that is breathing out the
[48:09] very word of god and that's what you
[48:12] identify and you begin to pull upon the
[48:14] gift of god and god will breathe over
[48:16] top of your situation or he'll breathe
[48:19] over your life and he will give you of
[48:20] himself once again or he'll give you
[48:23] healing or he'll he'll give you he'll
[48:25] give you different things or different
[48:26] things that that are laid out in the
[48:28] scriptures there are things that are
[48:30] laid there but when the inspiration of
[48:32] the holy ghost can begin to move across
[48:34] the congregation and you watch that that
[48:37] it's not the man but it's the it's the
[48:39] inspiration of almighty god and you
[48:41] could be sitting here you know all the
[48:43] scriptures you you know and you might be
[48:45] sickened by it you might have a
[48:46] different need and you know all the
[48:48] scriptures you have all the faith in the
[48:50] world you could sit there and they could
[48:52] say there's no sin in your life but yet
[48:54] what you're needing is the inspiration
[48:56] of almighty god to come and to quicken
[48:58] that word to life to make it alive to
[49:01] you to see that it's more than just a
[49:03] scripture of days gone by or maybe
[49:05] necessarily just the inspiration of god
[49:08] to come and to step in and to come and
[49:10] elevate your faith or take you into
[49:13] another level it's the inspiration of
[49:15] god that begins to give you to give you
[49:18] those things that are laying there in
[49:20] his word and notice what the bible said
[49:22] in isaiah and six that for unto us a a
[49:26] child is
[49:28] born and unto us a son is given and the
[49:33] government shall be upon his shoulders
[49:35] and his name shall be called wonderful
[49:38] counsel or the mighty god the
[49:39] everlasting father the prince of peace
[49:42] so we recognize right away that god has
[49:44] given us something but more more than
[49:46] just recognizing in the scripture but we
[49:49] look here and see that this was given by
[49:52] by a man that necessarily didn't
[49:54] understand what he was saying he didn't
[49:56] necessarily maybe grasp by isaiah when
[49:58] the inspiration of god would come and
[50:00] move over across him and he would speak
[50:02] these things but notice there's more
[50:04] than just a sun in the picture but there
[50:07] is a people that is in the picture that
[50:10] is there to receive that which he has
[50:13] given and you look and you see that god
[50:15] had a certain time in a certain season
[50:18] that he would deliver this word to a
[50:20] people that were ready to receive it and
[50:23] notice when jesus begins to begins to
[50:25] take them through matthew 13 when he
[50:27] begins to take them through the spoken
[50:29] word is the original seed and he takes
[50:31] them through the seed chapter and he
[50:33] begins to speak to them about the
[50:35] parable of the sower and then the man
[50:37] that came through there in a dark clothe
[50:39] and he came through there and he sold
[50:41] out tares and different things but
[50:42] notice what when jesus is laying out
[50:45] when he's laying out the foundations of
[50:47] what the seed is there he begins to
[50:49] teach them about the seed some fell by
[50:51] the wayside some fell on stony ground
[50:54] but some fell in fertile ground and
[50:56] jesus began to tell them that he that
[50:59] hath an ear let him hear and when when
[51:02] his disciples came to him they began to
[51:04] ask him said now why are you talking in
[51:06] these riddles why are you talking to the
[51:08] people why are you talking to them like
[51:10] this why are you talking to them in
[51:12] parables and notice what jesus would say
[51:15] he said to you it is given to know the
[51:18] mysteries of the kingdom of god but to
[51:20] them it is not given you see you have
[51:23] been granted as an overcomer in the day
[51:26] that you're living in for it is for a
[51:28] select people that can walk in the light
[51:32] and know that he is in the light but
[51:34] notice blessed are your eyes for you see
[51:37] and blessed are your ears for you here
[51:41] are you with me this evening
[51:43] but notice what the bible says in romans
[51:45] 8 and 31 that what shall we say to these
[51:48] things if god before us
[51:51] who
[51:52] can be against us he that spared not his
[51:55] own son but delivered him up for us how
[51:58] shall he not with him also
[52:00] also freely give us all things amen can
[52:04] you read that with me how
[52:07] how shall he not with him also freely
[52:11] give us all things
[52:13] he has granted us access to the one and
[52:17] the true and living god and when brother
[52:19] branham would say that when you receive
[52:21] the baptism of the holy ghost he said
[52:23] that you have everything everything that
[52:25] you have need of in this life's journey
[52:28] was given to you when you receive the
[52:30] baptism of the holy ghost and you remind
[52:33] i'll just remind you just for a moment
[52:34] when brother branham would come in 1962
[52:37] when he would preach on a subject on all
[52:39] things and there he is and right around
[52:42] thanksgiving time and he's and he's
[52:44] speaking these things on all things but
[52:46] you remember brother man i'm saying now
[52:47] he said now i can't surely i surely
[52:49] can't speak on all things he said but
[52:51] i'll speak on part and he said i can
[52:53] speak on pardon and a pardon means to be
[52:56] freed from guilt it means to be
[52:59] completely set free completely in your
[53:01] mind completely your soul completely
[53:03] pardoned completely free just like when
[53:06] a governor would walk into walk into the
[53:08] prison door
[53:10] you have the right to accept it as a
[53:12] pardon or turn it down as a pardon but
[53:14] it's only received if you receive it as
[53:17] a pardon but you remember where brother
[53:19] madam is standing at at that time in
[53:21] life where where brother branham is
[53:23] called down to a scene when there's a
[53:26] man that has been his critic that has
[53:27] criticized divine healing has criticized
[53:30] the move of god has criticized the
[53:32] pillar of fire but here a man by the
[53:35] name of william branham goes and stands
[53:37] in a court of law before here he was
[53:40] standing standing as an advocate
[53:43] standing up for somebody that criticized
[53:45] him and to think that the one that
[53:47] criticized him was the man was the man
[53:50] that he was criticizing was the one that
[53:52] came and gave a testimony that got is
[53:55] child out of trouble but you remember
[53:57] that this is more than just a man that's
[53:59] standing there in time but notice where
[54:01] we are at when brother branham becomes
[54:03] in that 1963 he begins to walk in there
[54:07] and he begins to bridge the gap a breach
[54:09] between the seven church ages and the
[54:11] seven seals and he is standing there as
[54:14] a man but notice it's at a time that the
[54:17] lamb is standing up and reading and
[54:20] standing up and waiting for redemptions
[54:22] claims
[54:24] he is coming to a time when he is going
[54:27] to set his children free completely free
[54:30] and if you are free you know you're free
[54:34] you remember the story about little
[54:36] johnny co the man came by and set him
[54:38] free but he had the captivity upon his
[54:40] mind he was so locked up in his mind
[54:43] that he was still thought that he was
[54:44] locked up there you don't have to stay
[54:47] where you're standing at you can go out
[54:49] the prison doors have flung wide you can
[54:52] walk out of here you can fly south you
[54:55] can fly north
[54:57] i ain't found one spot in the scriptures
[54:59] that you can't fly but a son knows that
[55:01] he's free a son is not weak in the
[55:04] thought that he's not a son he's not
[55:06] weak in a thought that he's a servant a
[55:08] son is a son
[55:09] and maybe you might have gone through a
[55:11] spot of spiritual amnesia that you
[55:13] forgot who you are but wake up soldier
[55:16] boy
[55:17] wake up soldier boy you'll not commit
[55:20] suicide you'll not commit those things
[55:23] soldier boy
[55:26] you know where you're at you know where
[55:28] you're standing at but his son knows
[55:30] where he's at all you got to do is take
[55:32] a look up at the water tower
[55:34] take a look up there and recognize i've
[55:37] been here before i've been in worship
[55:39] like that before i've been in i've been
[55:41] in an atmosphere like that before i've
[55:44] sat in a place you've been granted the
[55:46] greatest thing in life
[55:52] notice
[55:54] notice what life is
[55:56] notice that the greek word
[55:59] for for for eternal life
[56:01] is zoe which means god's
[56:04] own life
[56:06] and if you are a son or a daughter of
[56:08] god you were you were in god all the
[56:10] time but he knew
[56:11] what bed and time that you'd be planted
[56:13] in
[56:14] so now you're made a creature
[56:16] a son of god manifested son or daughter
[56:19] of god to meet the challenge of this
[56:20] hour to vindicate the true
[56:23] and living god of this hour the message
[56:27] that's coming forth in this time
[56:29] so you see you have been risen to a time
[56:33] for such as this
[56:34] to come and to vindicate the very
[56:37] message and to manifest and meet the
[56:40] challenge of the hour and god has always
[56:43] had men throughout time that would come
[56:46] and would rise and meet the challenge
[56:48] just like when jonah would get in
[56:50] trouble when he was out there and he
[56:51] knew that he was the one that was
[56:53] creating all of this trouble he said
[56:55] throw me over i'm the reason why this
[56:57] thing is happening but he got down there
[56:59] and he had circumstances more than any
[57:01] human being could have had ever had
[57:03] everywhere he looked was whale's belly
[57:05] everywhere he looked was a circumstance
[57:08] that was pointing to his death but there
[57:10] was on a hill there was a a temple up
[57:14] there that he would remind himself about
[57:16] that when solomon was building that
[57:18] temple when he moved upon david it's
[57:21] hard to build that temple and god worked
[57:23] through solomon to build that temple and
[57:26] solomon said that if any of god's
[57:28] children would ever be in a time of
[57:30] trouble that they could turn their eyes
[57:32] towards the east and to pray and god
[57:34] would deliver them out of trouble and
[57:36] you could be in the worst circumstances
[57:38] of life but you can turn your eyes
[57:40] towards jesus
[57:42] and you can turn your eyes towards the
[57:44] one that knows how to set you free you
[57:46] can turn your eyes to one towards the
[57:49] one that knows how to get you out of
[57:51] circumstances
[57:52] you can turn your eyes to the one that
[57:54] gave you life
[57:57] hallelujah
[57:59] hallelujah
[58:01] david knew this
[58:03] that loving kindness was better
[58:06] than life we know that life is what
[58:09] controls us we are known by the very
[58:11] life that we live and it's been said
[58:13] that our life speaks louder than words
[58:16] i can hear your testimony
[58:19] your life your life speaks so much
[58:21] louder and you can't even hear your
[58:23] testimony by the life that you're living
[58:25] because your life is speaking louder
[58:27] than what you're saying it's the life
[58:29] that you live shows what character that
[58:32] you are
[58:33] because your life always builds your
[58:36] character
[58:39] you can say one thing and do another
[58:43] but if it's not really in there
[58:45] something's not going to come out right
[58:47] now let me let me just change the scene
[58:49] just for a moment i know you've been fed
[58:50] full of turkey so i'll change it up for
[58:52] you just for a moment so so you can get
[58:54] loose maybe how gravy you get to work
[58:57] but you remember you remember when when
[58:59] brother burnham when brother branham was
[59:01] he said when i preached about my very
[59:02] first sermon he said he said i preached
[59:04] my very first sermon there and he said
[59:06] he said i i i was he said i the the
[59:09] minister called me and he said i come
[59:10] over and he said i was i come over and i
[59:12] was preaching i was gonna preach on that
[59:13] wednesday night and he said he said i
[59:15] come in there and he said you know he
[59:17] said i i come in there and i put all the
[59:19] emotions in it he he said i cried i i
[59:22] swear i waved my hands back and forth he
[59:24] said i waved my hands back and forth i
[59:26] slapped the desk i did everything and
[59:28] and i put all the emotions into it and
[59:31] he said he said when i went back here to
[59:32] the back he said all the other sisters
[59:34] uh the elderly were coming back there
[59:36] and slapping me on the back and saying
[59:37] oh that was a fine job billy god's gonna
[59:40] make a preacher out of you and he went
[59:41] over and asked dr davis you remember he
[59:43] said i went over and asked dr davis said
[59:45] what did you think he said that's the
[59:46] worst i ever heard

[59:50] billy he said i want you to come he said
[59:52] i want you to come down to my office
[59:53] tomorrow about two o'clock and when he
[59:55] got over there dr davis said he said i
[59:57] said i'm sure i hurt your feelings he
[59:59] said well he said they just kind of
[1:00:00] stepped on a little bit they stepped on
[1:00:02] a little bit and he said he said billy
[1:00:04] so when i tell he said i want to tell
[1:00:05] you something he said one time before i
[1:00:07] was a preacher he said i was a lawyer
[1:00:09] not studied law he said i went to the
[1:00:11] courtroom and i went in there and he
[1:00:13] said i'd watched how all those other
[1:00:14] lawyers had come in there and had done
[1:00:16] everything and he said i watched and he
[1:00:18] said it was my first case and i went in
[1:00:20] there and i i was representing this this
[1:00:22] woman that was going through a divorce
[1:00:24] and he said i went in there and he said
[1:00:26] i put all the emotions into it he said i
[1:00:28] screamed and i i boo-hooed and i
[1:00:30] hollered i slapped the desk like other
[1:00:32] lawyers had done it i had done
[1:00:34] everything i could and then the then the
[1:00:37] opposing attorney was on the other side
[1:00:39] and he stood up and said judge how much
[1:00:42] more can this nonsense of this nonsense
[1:00:45] can this court handle
[1:00:47] and there that man was a it was a bribe
[1:00:49] it was a friend for us a friend to dr
[1:00:52] davis and the judge was a friend he said
[1:00:54] i did that for a purpose he said i did
[1:00:56] that for your good he said all of your
[1:00:59] emotions was right he said what did i do
[1:01:00] wrong he said all of your emotions was
[1:01:03] right he said but you didn't have one
[1:01:05] iota of law into it
[1:01:07] he said you had all the emotions he said
[1:01:09] he said but you didn't have one iota of
[1:01:11] law and the people are not set free
[1:01:14] they're not set free by emotions they're
[1:01:17] set free by the verdict of the law of
[1:01:20] what the law says and there are some
[1:01:22] people that go through or they base
[1:01:24] their christianity strictly upon
[1:01:27] emotions
[1:01:29] they base their religion or what they
[1:01:31] think of what god is or what god's got
[1:01:33] to do and and they put him in a box and
[1:01:36] and they get they base all of their
[1:01:37] christianity upon emotions and upon
[1:01:40] feelings you'll watch some people that
[1:01:42] you'll watch how the spirit of the lord
[1:01:44] will move and he'll work through a man
[1:01:45] of god and that man of god will say
[1:01:48] something he'll maybe prophesy over
[1:01:50] somebody or you'll watch it god will
[1:01:52] come down and thus saith the lord and
[1:01:53] speak something but because they put
[1:01:55] their own private interpretation to it
[1:01:59] because they put their own private
[1:02:01] interpretation to it they take it one
[1:02:03] way or maybe a preacher said something
[1:02:05] over top of you or something like that
[1:02:07] and maybe things didn't come out the way
[1:02:09] you thought they would but god had
[1:02:11] everything worked out
[1:02:13] and you get all emotional you get all
[1:02:14] the feelings you get excited oh my we
[1:02:17] just love we love when the spirit of the
[1:02:19] god begins to move across the
[1:02:20] congregation and man he begins to move
[1:02:23] and you can feel the freedom of christ
[1:02:26] just begin to rise up and some people
[1:02:28] base all of their christianity strictly
[1:02:31] upon feelings and upon emotions
[1:02:36] but then there's some people that come
[1:02:38] on the other side and be a fanatic of
[1:02:40] the other side and work up the holy
[1:02:42] ghost so much that the holy ghost can't
[1:02:45] move anymore they're so dead by the
[1:02:47] letter that they won't allow the holy
[1:02:49] ghost loose
[1:02:51] but it's about finding that balance in
[1:02:54] the word and staying right there
[1:02:56] you see you can get yourself so excited
[1:02:59] you can get yourself so under the
[1:03:01] emotion so under the atmosphere of the
[1:03:03] holy ghost but if what you're missing if
[1:03:06] what you are watching take place it's
[1:03:08] not backed up by the word
[1:03:11] you'll never move anything you can have
[1:03:14] a train looking fine sitting on the
[1:03:16] track you can have everything in order
[1:03:18] but if it ain't got no steam in it if it
[1:03:20] ain't got no fire in the wood if it's
[1:03:22] only mechanics it'll never produce
[1:03:25] it'll never set it'll just sit right
[1:03:27] there and it'll become an antique all of
[1:03:29] its days
[1:03:35] but oh just let the dynamics begin to
[1:03:37] move
[1:03:38] you watch and you begin to watch
[1:03:40] everything come in order and you watch
[1:03:42] it quickening of the holy ghost you
[1:03:44] watch somebody you watch somebody that's
[1:03:46] real solid in the word you watch
[1:03:48] somebody when the atmosphere gets right
[1:03:50] you watch an eagle they know how to fly
[1:03:53] now a chicken can get just an emotional
[1:03:55] when the feed gets thrown out on the
[1:03:57] ground
[1:03:58] they can get emotional and they can peck
[1:04:00] around and they can hoop and holler and
[1:04:01] all kinds of things but oh they can't
[1:04:04] get up above the post
[1:04:06] but an eagle knows how to get up there
[1:04:10] he's been up there before
[1:04:18] hallelujah
[1:04:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:04:22] isn't he good to
[1:04:24] us hallelujah
[1:04:28] no no no now watch this
[1:04:30] watch this here in future home he said
[1:04:33] now are we the sons of god
[1:04:35] not we will be
[1:04:37] but we are the attributes of god's
[1:04:39] thinking now you say well well look at
[1:04:41] this preaching he's speaking of the
[1:04:43] priest in the days of jesus he said look
[1:04:45] at this priest wasn't he a son of god it
[1:04:48] it proved he wasn't because he couldn't
[1:04:50] recognize what what did he say he said i
[1:04:53] believe the bible sure but he couldn't
[1:04:55] recognize the express word of god or the
[1:04:59] express word of the hour he only had an
[1:05:02] intellectual learning from some group
[1:05:04] that had been back before him and it's
[1:05:07] the same thing today i know it's that
[1:05:08] strong but it's the truth that's what
[1:05:10] the word er that's what that was the
[1:05:13] word i spoken exactly for that day and
[1:05:16] yet he was a scholar yet he had he was a
[1:05:18] renowned person but he he couldn't
[1:05:20] recognize it why no matter how scholar
[1:05:23] he was anything like that he still
[1:05:25] didn't have representation of
[1:05:27] predestination
[1:05:28] only to predestinate it will only be the
[1:05:31] ones who does it only can be and you
[1:05:34] only can do it because look it proves
[1:05:36] predestination because if you've got
[1:05:38] eternal life you had to be a part of god
[1:05:41] at all times
[1:05:42] because he's the only one is eternal
[1:05:48] life you begin to think about all the
[1:05:52] attributes and you begin to think about
[1:05:53] all the rights that you have as a son
[1:05:56] and daughter of god you have a right to
[1:05:58] worship
[1:05:59] you have a right to praise you have a
[1:06:01] right to access him by the throne of
[1:06:03] grace and come boldly before him because
[1:06:05] there's a blood that is upon the mercy
[1:06:08] you can come before him and you
[1:06:09] recognize that he will daily load you
[1:06:12] with benefits you can watch all of these
[1:06:14] things you know all of your rights but
[1:06:16] we are living in an hour where men are
[1:06:18] being stripped of their rights in
[1:06:20] humanity the republicans are stripping
[1:06:23] you from your rights
[1:06:24] the democrats are stripping you from
[1:06:26] your rights they're wanting to take your
[1:06:28] arms they're wanting to take your take
[1:06:30] your freedom of speech they're wanting
[1:06:32] to take freedom of religion away from
[1:06:34] you they're wanting to take away all of
[1:06:36] your freedoms
[1:06:40] now now i know i did something to you
[1:06:42] last weekend and i i i'm sorry i did
[1:06:44] that to you but i was doing it for a
[1:06:46] purpose you all got so excited because
[1:06:49] somebody said something personally about
[1:06:51] me and i was speaking about the spirit
[1:06:52] of anger man alive it was a whole
[1:06:54] congregation got so upset
[1:06:57] they got so upset because somebody said
[1:06:59] something about me
[1:07:01] i know what you're talking about i'm
[1:07:02] glad you come out to fight for me
[1:07:05] i mean hey i'm glad i got somebody who
[1:07:06] loves me
[1:07:08] thank you for that i really do
[1:07:09] appreciate that but you'll watch so many
[1:07:12] christians sometimes get their rights of
[1:07:14] worship taken away from them and they'll
[1:07:17] sit there and never move off the
[1:07:19] promises of god or they won't move over
[1:07:21] and say well i guess that's going to be
[1:07:22] all right you don't recognize what
[1:07:24] you've been given
[1:07:27] and when something gets taken away from
[1:07:29] you then you realize how powerful a
[1:07:32] thing you've been given
[1:07:34] you let somebody come in here and try to
[1:07:37] take your bible away from you man you'll
[1:07:39] jump up and you'll do everything you can
[1:07:41] to stop somebody from taking it
[1:07:45] but you let the enemy come in and he'll
[1:07:46] start whispering lies into your ears
[1:07:49] whispering oh it's okay it's okay to lay
[1:07:51] out it's okay to do this or it's okay to
[1:07:53] smoke it's okay to dip it's okay to try
[1:07:55] one of these things and the enemy will
[1:07:57] come in and he will steal your god-given
[1:08:00] rights away from you
[1:08:02] it's high time that the sons and
[1:08:04] daughters of god would begin to
[1:08:06] recognize their position
[1:08:09] and let god prove himself one more time
[1:08:13] prove that he's god
[1:08:15] prove that he's the same
[1:08:17] you watch tomorrow as we baptize these
[1:08:20] children and these older adults we
[1:08:22] baptize them in a watery gate in a
[1:08:24] watery grave in the name of the lord
[1:08:26] jesus christ god will prove himself
[1:08:29] he'll prove himself i don't have to fill
[1:08:32] them with the holy ghost but god is
[1:08:34] obligated to the very word of god to
[1:08:36] give them an outpouring of the holy
[1:08:39] ghost
[1:08:43] glory be to god
[1:08:46] i'm sorry brothers but i i sound like a
[1:08:49] barrel up here if y'all could help me
[1:08:50] out i sure would appreciate it i don't
[1:08:52] know how it sounds out there but up here
[1:08:54] i sound like i
[1:08:55] i've been wrung out
[1:08:58] but notice
[1:08:59] notice when when jesus
[1:09:01] begins to deal
[1:09:03] he begins to deal with a sister
[1:09:06] we're very acquainted with a story
[1:09:08] but he comes he comes to this lady
[1:09:12] this woman of he'll fame
[1:09:14] he begins to deal with her when when he
[1:09:16] comes from one way and she comes from a
[1:09:18] total different way of life
[1:09:21] he should have never been in this area
[1:09:23] but the bible said that he had needs to
[1:09:25] go by samaria
[1:09:27] and here was this man that was that was
[1:09:29] was there was a teacher of teacher he
[1:09:32] was a master of masters and here he was
[1:09:35] he sent his disciples by one way
[1:09:40] because hey
[1:09:42] not everybody can understand what jesus
[1:09:44] is doing
[1:09:46] not everybody can understand why a
[1:09:48] pastor or a preacher would come off of
[1:09:51] his subject to go by a whale somebody
[1:09:54] and go sit down by a well when nobody
[1:09:56] else would go around him when nobody
[1:09:58] else would go around this woman of real
[1:09:59] fame maybe but jesus will go
[1:10:02] where pharisees won't go
[1:10:04] jesus will go where some so-called
[1:10:06] message people won't go
[1:10:08] jesus will go where the gene seed of god
[1:10:11] is
[1:10:12] because god knows where his seed is
[1:10:14] laying out he knew where he cast it out
[1:10:17] you might be the preacher and you might
[1:10:18] be sowing seed just because that's your
[1:10:20] job you don't know where it's going to
[1:10:22] land at but you just sow the seed but
[1:10:24] god is obligated
[1:10:27] he knows which one fell on stoney ground
[1:10:29] and he knows which one fell involved on
[1:10:31] fertile ground and he's obligated to get
[1:10:34] his seed
[1:10:36] but here jesus goes over here
[1:10:39] notice what brother branham says
[1:10:41] improving his word he said he was
[1:10:42] watching
[1:10:44] he was watching
[1:10:46] he was watching you imagine as jesus
[1:10:49] begins to take this journey
[1:10:51] because he knows where his seed has been
[1:10:53] sown at
[1:10:57] and you begin to get so caught up in the
[1:10:59] circumstances of life because
[1:11:01] there's tears in there
[1:11:03] and there's wheat in there and you get
[1:11:05] so caught up and say man
[1:11:07] i got to get my children out of that
[1:11:08] i've got i got to do this
[1:11:11] you see when that enemy came by there
[1:11:13] and he began to throw tares out he began
[1:11:15] to throw that evil seed out there
[1:11:17] it was not an attack against you
[1:11:20] it was attack against the owner of the
[1:11:21] field
[1:11:25] but i want you to know that god has
[1:11:27] angels that are sent out to separate the
[1:11:30] wheat from the tare
[1:11:32] and you watch what is taking place as
[1:11:34] the separation begins to take place how
[1:11:36] the day how that the angels begin to
[1:11:38] move and you watch the wheat as it comes
[1:11:40] out and it begins to stand out in front
[1:11:42] of the congress in front of the world
[1:11:44] it begins to stand out oh my you begin
[1:11:47] to see what's right and what's wrong
[1:11:50] and here everybody was looking they
[1:11:52] thought they were looking at a tear
[1:11:55] they thought oh this woman would never
[1:11:56] walk with jesus this woman would never
[1:11:58] be welcomed but she was sitting at the
[1:12:01] right spot at the right time
[1:12:04] you think you think jesus didn't know
[1:12:07] what he was doing
[1:12:09] he was walking through elkton because he
[1:12:11] had a seed that was sitting down there
[1:12:13] by whale this was not a woman that was
[1:12:16] just thirsty for natural water she was
[1:12:19] thirsty in her soul
[1:12:24] jesus was watching
[1:12:26] he was watching what would happen
[1:12:30] and he begins to tell her
[1:12:32] you worship what you know not
[1:12:35] but we jews know what we worship
[1:12:38] he said by the way why don't you go get
[1:12:39] your husband she said i have no husband
[1:12:42] he said you've sold the truth
[1:12:45] for the one you're living with and the
[1:12:46] five others they weren't your
[1:12:48] husbands i have come
[1:12:51] to give you life and to give your life
[1:12:53] more abundantly and he was watching he
[1:12:57] was watching what she would do
[1:12:59] now if there would have not been
[1:13:01] anything on the inside of her it would
[1:13:03] have never stuck but because there was
[1:13:05] something laying there
[1:13:07] because there was a gene seed of god
[1:13:09] that was there
[1:13:10] oh i tell you that's a thing to put on
[1:13:12] your mind and put on your heart when the
[1:13:14] enemy begins to whisper you start
[1:13:16] speaking positivity and saying i am a
[1:13:19] gene seed of god i am made in the image
[1:13:21] of god i'm a verb i'm a born son and
[1:13:25] daughter of god i know who i am
[1:13:29] but something was laying there
[1:13:31] that took a hold she had representation
[1:13:36] by predestination
[1:13:38] but here was this here was this priest
[1:13:40] or this pharisee that was saying this
[1:13:42] man's beelzebub he he cast out devils by
[1:13:46] he didn't have no predestination he
[1:13:48] didn't have no representation
[1:13:52] but she said
[1:13:56] sir
[1:13:57] i perceive
[1:13:59] that thou art a prophet
[1:14:03] watch what brother brandon said he said
[1:14:04] that's just all he wanted her to see
[1:14:09] that's just all he wanted her to see
[1:14:11] i can take you
[1:14:13] help me lord
[1:14:15] that's all he wanted to see
[1:14:17] you can come up to somebody's front door
[1:14:20] and you can judge a whole lot you can
[1:14:22] look at that joe you can look at that
[1:14:23] door and you can see
[1:14:24] you can see what kind of house they got
[1:14:26] there
[1:14:28] you can open up that door and you ain't
[1:14:29] got to go all the way in
[1:14:31] you can see what kind of house he got
[1:14:33] just by looking at the door and jesus
[1:14:35] said i am the door
[1:14:37] that's all he wanted her to see was who
[1:14:39] he was
[1:14:40] and when he seen when she seen who he
[1:14:42] was
[1:14:43] she dropped everything that she was she
[1:14:46] ran and dropped everything and ran and
[1:14:49] told those men
[1:14:51] she went and told those pharisees that
[1:14:53] she'd been dealing with she said come
[1:14:55] and see a man that told me the very
[1:14:57] things and secrets of my heart is this
[1:14:59] not the man
[1:15:04] come on somebody she got the inspiration
[1:15:07] god began to breathe over her and all of
[1:15:10] a sudden that gene seed of god began to
[1:15:13] quicken
[1:15:17] i mean i
[1:15:18] let me just say this
[1:15:20] your warfare is not determined
[1:15:22] by your past
[1:15:24] it's determined by your future
[1:15:29] the devil ain't shook up about what you
[1:15:31] were
[1:15:32] the devil ain't shook up about what you
[1:15:34] are right now but he is shook up about
[1:15:36] what you will be
[1:15:39] the reason why some of you have fought
[1:15:41] so hard to believe this is because the
[1:15:44] devil is afraid of what you will be
[1:15:47] goliath was not scared of david as a
[1:15:50] shepherd he was not scared as a son of
[1:15:52] jesse but when this man david when he
[1:15:55] recognized he was going to be king all
[1:15:58] hail turned loose on david
[1:16:02] your warfare is not determined by your
[1:16:04] past it's determined by your future and
[1:16:07] if you are fighting hell it shows heaven
[1:16:10] is in your future
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:19] you need to walk around with a chip on
[1:16:21] your shoulder and acknowledge that the
[1:16:22] enemy is expecting you to be defeated
[1:16:24] enemy you listen up we will not be
[1:16:28] defeated
[1:16:29] we will not go down and ruin but we will
[1:16:32] rise
[1:16:34] we will come up conquerors we will come
[1:16:37] up overcomers
[1:16:39] because we have been given rights
[1:16:42] to the tree
[1:16:44] of life
[1:16:47] we know who that tree is
[1:16:49] [Applause]
[1:16:51] now notice now we all know the story
[1:16:53] in john chapter 11 we all know the story
[1:16:56] of how jesus went by the way of his
[1:16:58] friend's grave and how he went by there
[1:17:00] and he resurrected his friend lazarus
[1:17:02] you know the story of quite well but you
[1:17:04] you remember in john chapter 12 we
[1:17:06] recognize that from the time of
[1:17:08] lazarus's resurrection that the
[1:17:10] pharisees took counsel to kill jesus
[1:17:12] and though here we recognize that these
[1:17:15] were men that didn't have representation
[1:17:18] but they were actually lacking who jesus
[1:17:20] was and they were living in the glare of
[1:17:22] the law
[1:17:24] but notice they didn't know they were
[1:17:26] not aware that there was a new
[1:17:27] dispensation at hand and really they
[1:17:30] didn't recognize that the message that
[1:17:31] they were preaching
[1:17:33] was past time and it had an expiration
[1:17:36] date on it it was no longer effective
[1:17:38] what they were preaching
[1:17:40] and these pharisees began to say amongst
[1:17:43] themselves how that they come up with
[1:17:44] all these schemes how do they try to
[1:17:46] destroy lazarus and try to destroy jesus
[1:17:50] but notice what the bible said in 12
[1:17:51] john 12 19 perceive how you prevail
[1:17:54] nothing
[1:17:55] behold the world's gone after him
[1:17:58] they come up with all of these schemes
[1:18:00] that and they come up these tactics but
[1:18:03] the pharisees are describing it
[1:18:05] themselves an attraction that is taking
[1:18:08] place to the man jesus to a man by their
[1:18:11] standards they had no right to preach or
[1:18:14] he had no right to do miracles yeah they
[1:18:16] weren't they weren't they weren't shook
[1:18:18] up by the rumors that he was a
[1:18:19] illegitimate child but they were shook
[1:18:21] up about what he would be and what he
[1:18:23] would do in the kingdom
[1:18:27] they didn't realize that they were in a
[1:18:29] junction and didn't realize where they
[1:18:31] were living at they didn't recognize
[1:18:34] that the prince of peace was right
[1:18:35] amongst them
[1:18:37] they didn't recognize that unto us his
[1:18:39] son
[1:18:40] is given
[1:18:42] but there was a people that had come to
[1:18:44] the realization because there was
[1:18:46] predestination
[1:18:48] that was laying there that was laying in
[1:18:50] front of them that's why they began to
[1:18:52] catch who he was and all of their
[1:18:55] schemes that the pharisees were coming
[1:18:56] up with for stopping the crowds from
[1:18:58] believing on him had failed and actually
[1:19:01] the more jesus preached the more faith
[1:19:03] grew the more miracles and healings that
[1:19:05] were done his fame grew and they
[1:19:08] prevailed nothing they couldn't stop
[1:19:10] people from believing on him they they
[1:19:12] was able to hang him on a cross but they
[1:19:14] couldn't stop him from believing on him
[1:19:16] they they hung him on a cross and they
[1:19:18] killed him but they couldn't stop him
[1:19:20] from believing on him they placed him in
[1:19:21] a tomb but they couldn't stop him from
[1:19:23] believing on him they rolled a stone in
[1:19:25] front of him and put a roman seal on it
[1:19:28] but you couldn't stop him from believing
[1:19:29] on him
[1:19:34] heaven
[1:19:35] didn't stop believing
[1:19:38] when jesus was in a tomb
[1:19:43] jesus believed what a backslidden
[1:19:46] prophet had said
[1:19:49] that thou will not suffer thy holy one
[1:19:50] to see corruption
[1:19:52] he went
[1:19:54] to the cross
[1:19:57] on a backslidden preacher's words
[1:20:01] because heaven
[1:20:03] will never let prophecy fall to the
[1:20:05] ground
[1:20:07] well what about me brother andrew what
[1:20:09] about my promise what what about what
[1:20:11] about what i was spoken god would not
[1:20:13] allow one word to fall to the ground
[1:20:16] he's the one who sowed it he's the one
[1:20:18] that'll water it you watch get ready to
[1:20:20] reap if you don't faint in due season
[1:20:24] you will reap
[1:20:25] what you have sown
[1:20:26] and if you have sown in faith you will
[1:20:29] reap in faith but if you sown in doubt
[1:20:32] if you stood there and what let your let
[1:20:34] you let them let the love of god wax
[1:20:36] cold in your life
[1:20:41] you'll start reaping the benefits of
[1:20:43] things that you've been sowing
[1:20:46] here these men they were looking around
[1:20:47] saying
[1:20:48] i don't know what we're going to do but
[1:20:49] they didn't realize that there was a new
[1:20:50] era at hand
[1:20:54] it doesn't matter what the religions of
[1:20:55] the world
[1:20:57] or the media of the world tries to do
[1:20:59] what the scoffers
[1:21:00] do in this day
[1:21:01] heavens declare
[1:21:03] that this word is true
[1:21:15] now notice
[1:21:17] notice now we we recognize
[1:21:21] we recognize that in the bible that we
[1:21:23] that we're taught in the old testament
[1:21:25] and the new testament there are four
[1:21:27] anointings
[1:21:28] that would come
[1:21:32] and we realized that that god would work
[1:21:35] through those anointings
[1:21:36] told in the old testament of the lion
[1:21:38] the ox the man and the flying eagle
[1:21:41] but notice that those anointings are
[1:21:43] always pointing forward they're never
[1:21:45] looking backwards like a like a frog but
[1:21:48] they're always pointing forward
[1:21:50] and those what what we understand is
[1:21:53] that those are the four anointings they
[1:21:55] are the guards
[1:21:56] to the book of life
[1:21:58] and we we look a and we recognize that
[1:22:01] when jesus would come and he would take
[1:22:03] the scriptures in matthew chapter 10
[1:22:05] and he would say and when he had called
[1:22:07] unto him his twelve disciples he gave
[1:22:10] them power against unclean spirits to
[1:22:12] cast them out and to heal all manner of
[1:22:14] sickness and all manner of disease
[1:22:16] and brother branham when he comes and he
[1:22:18] takes on takes the the series on
[1:22:20] revelation he said you see that guard
[1:22:22] sitting there at the gate
[1:22:24] he said the gospel guard to back up that
[1:22:27] book of acts that was wrong now jesus
[1:22:30] knew that there would be scoffers rise
[1:22:32] jesus knew that there would be critics
[1:22:34] that would come against it that's why
[1:22:36] jesus didn't build the church upon a man
[1:22:38] and that's why jesus didn't build the
[1:22:40] church upon himself but he built it up
[1:22:42] strictly upon the revelation of who he
[1:22:46] was
[1:22:47] i i you remember that jesus said that
[1:22:49] the gates of hell will not be able to
[1:22:51] prevail against it you remember you
[1:22:53] remember it now i want you to notice
[1:22:55] that this rock that jesus is building on
[1:22:58] it's not a rock that can be thrown it's
[1:23:00] not a rock that can be thrown away it's
[1:23:02] not a rock that can be cast it's not a
[1:23:04] rock that can be skipped across a river
[1:23:06] but this rock is a rock that can go in a
[1:23:09] swing and it can take down a goliath
[1:23:12] and here that here we recognize that the
[1:23:15] four gospels are the framework to back
[1:23:18] up pentecost and there were men in
[1:23:20] brother branham's day it said that that
[1:23:22] that the book of acts was a scaffold
[1:23:24] work but brother branham would come and
[1:23:26] he would speak he said that's not the
[1:23:28] scaffold work he said the four gospels
[1:23:32] what's the framework to be the way it
[1:23:34] was before it was the four gospels i
[1:23:37] mean the four gospels framed up the
[1:23:39] church they framed up the temple then
[1:23:42] pentecost came into existence
[1:23:46] the reason why we can preach to you
[1:23:47] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[1:23:49] christ the reason why we can preach to
[1:23:51] you a baptism or the revelation of who
[1:23:54] he was and in acts 2 38 experience is
[1:23:58] because the gospels are backing us up
[1:24:03] you know jesus walked around and he's
[1:24:05] got these men that are following matthew
[1:24:07] mark luke and john and they're following
[1:24:09] him around everywhere he goes and
[1:24:11] they're following him and here jesus
[1:24:13] walks around and he starts predicting
[1:24:15] and starts telling what's taking place
[1:24:17] and those men begin to take and they
[1:24:19] begin to write down what jesus was
[1:24:21] saying and all of a sudden brother
[1:24:23] marlon said that they framed up the
[1:24:25] church he said they framed up the church
[1:24:28] all around it he said that's the guard
[1:24:30] work that protects the main temple the
[1:24:33] throne the pentecostal blessing
[1:24:40] it's the framework it's the guard
[1:24:44] but you remember when adam and eve was
[1:24:45] kicked out of the garden of eden
[1:24:48] they were kicked out of the garden of
[1:24:49] eden
[1:24:50] and god
[1:24:52] put cherubims there
[1:24:53] with swords to guard
[1:24:56] the rights back to eden
[1:24:58] but you remember when when they were
[1:25:00] they were there
[1:25:01] and brother branham said that when he
[1:25:03] said if you're scared of the holy ghost
[1:25:06] you're scared
[1:25:07] you'll never get in
[1:25:09] he said because it's that holy ghost
[1:25:12] that's guarding
[1:25:13] the rights
[1:25:15] to the tree of life
[1:25:17] he said but notice he said adam was
[1:25:18] given the word to live by
[1:25:20] but he failed
[1:25:22] moses was given the lord the word to
[1:25:24] live by but he failed david was given
[1:25:27] the word to live by
[1:25:28] but he failed
[1:25:30] and when moses is standing there in
[1:25:31] exodus 14 he begins to tell them he said
[1:25:34] in no other place shall you worship me
[1:25:37] not in this gate not in that gate not in
[1:25:39] here he's but in the place that i choose
[1:25:42] to put my name
[1:25:44] and he chose no other place
[1:25:46] but in his son christ jesus to put his
[1:25:50] put his name in
[1:25:52] and there is power in that name
[1:25:55] and when we baptize in the name of the
[1:25:58] lord jesus christ you're not taking on
[1:26:01] and you're not taking on just a mortal
[1:26:03] man's name you're taking on the name of
[1:26:06] all heaven for jesus said all power in
[1:26:10] heaven and in earth is given unto me
[1:26:15] think about it all power in heaven and
[1:26:18] in earth is given unto me and when you
[1:26:21] begin to take on his name you are
[1:26:23] married to him
[1:26:25] but when you are baptized in trinitarian
[1:26:28] baptism you're not taken on a name
[1:26:30] you're taking on titles
[1:26:32] matter of fact the name you're taking on
[1:26:34] is roman catholicism
[1:26:36] that'll never resurrect you actually
[1:26:38] that'll bury you
[1:26:40] but the name of jesus christ is a strong
[1:26:42] tower and the righteous run into it and
[1:26:46] are saved
[1:26:52] hey man it is good
[1:27:01] but notice
[1:27:03] when brother brown comes
[1:27:04] an ephesian church age
[1:27:08] and he begins to walk in there and he
[1:27:10] begins to take a look
[1:27:12] he said how astonishing it is
[1:27:14] to think that all that adam was rejected
[1:27:17] from
[1:27:18] has now given as a reward to the
[1:27:20] overcomer
[1:27:26] he said
[1:27:27] that that cherubim
[1:27:30] had to sheath his sword
[1:27:33] and allow access back to the gate
[1:27:38] he said but oh
[1:27:40] that sword had the blood of the lamb on
[1:27:43] it
[1:27:46] to allow you to get back into the access
[1:27:50] you see because where there is no blood
[1:27:52] there is a powerless
[1:27:54] religion
[1:27:57] you and i as christians we can point to
[1:27:59] an empty tomb
[1:28:03] we don't brag
[1:28:05] it's just facts
[1:28:07] there is an empty tomb
[1:28:10] there is power
[1:28:11] in this empty tomb because the one who
[1:28:14] walked out of there
[1:28:16] is our lord jesus christ
[1:28:19] now there's other there's other gods
[1:28:20] that's still living in their tombs
[1:28:23] and people worship under that
[1:28:26] but that god can never come and live on
[1:28:28] the inside
[1:28:29] of the worshiper
[1:28:31] but this god
[1:28:33] has come and said that i will worship i
[1:28:34] will worship in you i will live in you i
[1:28:37] will fill you i will be your comforter i
[1:28:39] will be your god i will be with you i'll
[1:28:41] never leave you i'll never forsake you
[1:28:46] you have been given the greatest
[1:28:48] thing in life
[1:28:50] access
[1:28:52] to the lord jesus
[1:28:59] and to think
[1:29:01] all that was turned down
[1:29:03] you now humanity has access to this tree
[1:29:06] of life
[1:29:10] tree is not a natural tree
[1:29:11] it's a human
[1:29:13] it's a person
[1:29:14] and this person
[1:29:16] is jesus
[1:29:18] but this is only granted to a select
[1:29:20] people
[1:29:22] to the overcomers of the age
[1:29:25] i'm i'm all i might blow some of your
[1:29:27] socks off right here
[1:29:30] it might be a little deep for you
[1:29:33] but whatever you give someone
[1:29:36] comes from you
[1:29:42] mind-blown
[1:29:46] it comes from you
[1:29:50] look gabriel come here
[1:29:55] i know your birthday was back in
[1:29:56] september but happy birthday
[1:30:00] happy birthday buddy
[1:30:07] i give him a hundred dollars for his
[1:30:08] birthday he's gonna give it to sarah
[1:30:12] that's a smart man
[1:30:20] but whatever i give somebody comes for
[1:30:21] me i'm identified with that now he can
[1:30:24] take it
[1:30:25] he could buy himself some hunting
[1:30:26] clothes or he can take that and buy her
[1:30:28] a nice dinner or he can buy or something
[1:30:30] nice for christmas
[1:30:32] i don't know what he'll do with it
[1:30:35] but there's one major difference
[1:30:37] when i give somebody something
[1:30:39] because i don't know what they'll do
[1:30:40] with it but god knows what you'll do
[1:30:42] with it
[1:30:44] god knows with what you will give what
[1:30:47] you've been given what you will do with
[1:30:48] it
[1:30:49] you've been granted the greatest access
[1:30:51] to the person of life and he knows
[1:30:53] exactly
[1:30:54] what you'll do with him
[1:30:58] now he could throw that right there on
[1:30:59] the ground
[1:31:00] ain't taking that
[1:31:02] there'd been somebody else come real
[1:31:03] quick
[1:31:05] faith was already eyeing that thing
[1:31:09] but whatever you give somebody
[1:31:11] comes from you
[1:31:15] so i am now identified with what i just
[1:31:18] gave
[1:31:20] what i just give away i'm identified
[1:31:22] with it he can't spend that hundred
[1:31:23] dollars without thinking about the one
[1:31:25] that give it to him
[1:31:27] but jesus come in the book and he said i
[1:31:29] will give unto thee the keys of the
[1:31:32] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever you
[1:31:34] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:31:37] and whatsoever you loose on him on earth
[1:31:40] shall be loosed in heaven you cannot
[1:31:42] bind anything on earth without thinking
[1:31:45] about the giver
[1:31:46] you can't lose anything on earth without
[1:31:49] thinking about the giver
[1:31:52] he's identified with what he gave and he
[1:31:55] gave his only begotten son
[1:31:58] that whosoever believeth on him
[1:32:02] when abraham was walking when he'd
[1:32:04] separated his whole entire life he'd
[1:32:07] separated from his mother and separated
[1:32:09] from his father he separated from his
[1:32:11] nephew
[1:32:14] it cost him something
[1:32:16] you're sitting here tonight because it
[1:32:18] cost you something
[1:32:21] it costs you a friendship to be here it
[1:32:23] costs you some money to get here
[1:32:27] abraham lost everything
[1:32:29] he lost his land
[1:32:31] but when god seen what abraham was
[1:32:34] willing to do
[1:32:35] he told him to arise and walk through
[1:32:38] the land look to the height look through
[1:32:41] the breath look through everything i
[1:32:43] have given to you
[1:32:48] the land that you're walking through as
[1:32:50] a possession was given to you by the
[1:32:53] giver of all mighty life god himself
[1:33:00] some of you
[1:33:02] you struggle for peace
[1:33:06] you struggle for peace at night
[1:33:08] your war in your mind your war of
[1:33:10] anxiety you war with things in your past
[1:33:17] you wore
[1:33:18] your war can i really be forgiven
[1:33:20] you warriors it's really true is it is
[1:33:23] god who he says he is
[1:33:27] man
[1:33:29] i think i dialed in
[1:33:36] can i really have that peace that passes
[1:33:38] all understanding
[1:33:41] does god really
[1:33:42] love
[1:33:43] me
[1:33:45] does god really care about me
[1:33:49] you know what it's like when you lay
[1:33:51] your head down on the pill and you begin
[1:33:52] to cry yourself to sleep because you
[1:33:54] can't find peace
[1:33:57] thanksgiving always isn't a wonderful
[1:33:59] time for people
[1:34:01] there's family members that are lost
[1:34:03] they're things that that family members
[1:34:04] can't come by because of hurt feelings
[1:34:06] or different things
[1:34:09] man you really struggle with that
[1:34:11] finding that peace finding that
[1:34:14] but notice what jesus said
[1:34:16] he said come unto me
[1:34:19] come unto me
[1:34:20] and i
[1:34:22] will give you
[1:34:23] rest
[1:34:25] where do rights to them tree come from
[1:34:30] where do rights to that peace come from
[1:34:33] where do rights to a sound mind come
[1:34:35] from
[1:34:37] where the rights
[1:34:38] to a clear well come from
[1:34:40] where the rights to a perfected marriage
[1:34:42] come from
[1:34:44] source it back where'd it come from
[1:34:48] it come from the giver
[1:34:50] so let me turn it one more time
[1:34:53] satan's tried to give you cancer
[1:34:55] he's trying to give you
[1:34:57] anxiety he's tried to tear away your
[1:35:00] mind
[1:35:01] tear away your peace tear away your
[1:35:03] children say they'll never be saved
[1:35:05] they'll never get in they'll i born in
[1:35:07] this family that maybe maybe just being
[1:35:09] close enough they wars in your mind
[1:35:11] where'd that come from
[1:35:13] that kind of mindset that whispers in
[1:35:16] your ear
[1:35:17] you're going to have to deal with that
[1:35:18] where did that come from
[1:35:20] it come from a liar
[1:35:21] it didn't come from a sustainer it
[1:35:24] didn't come from the author of life
[1:35:26] where did it come from satan is the one
[1:35:28] that's giving out lies satan's the ones
[1:35:30] that giving out anxiety don't stand in
[1:35:33] his line you ain't got to stand in his
[1:35:35] soup line everything he gives out you
[1:35:37] got to eat start standing in the line
[1:35:40] for the tree of life
