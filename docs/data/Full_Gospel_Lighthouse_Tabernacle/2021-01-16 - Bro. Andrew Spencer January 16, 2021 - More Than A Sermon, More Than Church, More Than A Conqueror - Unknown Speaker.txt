father for your children to to worship you and to hear from heaven father lord we pray that you'd move us past ourselves father i pray father that you would pierce through the darkness of our life the the darkness of laodicea that has tried to permeate our soul father i pray that your word would go directly to the spotlight jesus you're everything to us go to thinking about how that you created the heavens and the earth father we know that you can control our emotions if you can control the winds and the ways father you can control our spirit father sometimes lord i many youthful spirit they they run off like a mustang but father all it takes is one one little tug of the holy spirit and you begin to move farther and you begin to pull that life under submission to your word lord i pray tonight that that all over this building that that you would be creator to every person father lord just like you were in the beginning i pray that you'd be right here in the ending of time that we would see the manifestation of your word as it's put in front of us father i pray god that we be careful to recognize that you're amongst us even now the lord i pray that you would just allow us god lord to have a very personal conversation with you tonight the lord where it's more than more than other people in the room but let it be so direct and so permeating into our soul lord that we would have a prevailing spot of this moment in time that we would say that jesus came and jesus spoke to us lord i pray that you would heal those that have been been sick father i know there's many needs lord it's been presented to you tonight that lord the doctors can't figure out lord i'm so thankful to know that dr jesus has taken his children's cases i pray god that we would see you moving tonight [Music] see you acting father as we know that you you act lord we know that you follow your word lord lord for chase the well and father i pray lord that you would allow your word to go to work father the bible says that many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth out all of them and it's by your stripes we're healed and father we take the same approach to your word to every case father and we ask god that you would take every situation under your control for the glory of the lord in jesus christ's name amen you have your bibles this evening like to look over in the book of hebrews chapter 12 and verse 23 and then also into revelations chapter 12 and verse 7. hebrews chapter 12 verse 23 we love the lord don't we hebrews chapter 12 and verse 23 we say amen when you have it this evening now the bible says here to the general assembly in the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus a mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire i'll let you have your seats at this time amen also revelations chapter 12 and verse 7. if you don't know where it's at it's in the last book of the bible and there was war in heaven and michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels i love this and prevailed not and prevailed not now notices neither was their fair their place found any more in heaven notice about all of these these these angels and the and the dragon and and all of the all of the things that are sitting here they prevailed not and their place was found where their their place was found no more in heaven and the greek dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb that's you and me they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death therefore rejoice ye heavens rejoice ye heavens rejoice ye heavens it's a battle right now we're in a battle for heavenly places but you uh you as the children of god have got a right to rejoice because the accuser of our brethren has been cast down and we overcome this enemy by the blood of the lamb and by the word of our testimony therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time oh what a wonderful scripture reading this evening we know that that all of the heavens and even at this time that the heavens and the earth they are contaminated they're contaminated with devils that are always constantly there to accuse us before our brethren but noting noting these things that there is an accuser that is against us it is also something to note that jesus is always there to intercede on our behalf that when the enemy comes and says the they did this and they did that or this is what they did there is a blood that is there to intercede that that jesus is still on the mercy seat that is saying that satan the blood is against you and no matter what you accuse them of the blood is bigger than all of your accusations no matter what you've been through in life the blood is bigger than what you did can we say amen that the blood is bigger than all that we've done in our past and all the things that will happen to us in our future the blood is bigger the blood is bigger than anything that we could imagine this evening now i'd like to speak to you on a thought on more than a sermon more than a church and more than conquerors now if we would if we would take time and just begin to reflect upon the power of a sermon you know as all the preaching that we could do sitting here and many hours have been spent of your life setting and listening to the preaching of the word but notice no matter what kind of speech is being given if if if all it is is just a speech then that's all it is but of all the preaching and all the all of the things it's just it's just speaking just like an auctioneer would be speaking or or a great orator would be speaking it would have no value and it would have no backup unless god backs up what the man of god is saying you see if if all we take of the preaching of the word is it's just words then there's no power to it but if god comes behind that man that is preaching that word and proves that that word is true and then the people still out there choose to disbelieve what the man of god has said when it's been proven then it is sin but notice that when god comes behind that word it's no longer a man speaking but then it becomes thus saith the lord to you you remember as i was in my study several several weeks ago and i told you that god was was allowing me to work on a subject and when it when it was the time that i would release that now now this is the time that god has decided that he would allow me to speak these things but i was in my i was in my study and you remember that i was praying god i ask that you give me more than a sermon because we are very acquainted with sermons we can never get tired of running out of sermons but i was praying god i want something more than just a sermon we want more than just church service we want more than just a good time at church we want life to come and i heard these words you keep stacking word on top of word and building cell on top of sale and it doesn't look like the body may be moving but you just keep stacking word on top of word and sail on top of sale and that body will move now i i figure in my my space of the life span that i've had here on earth for 33 years and i've spent most of my life i've spent most of my life in church services and i was doing some calculations i've been and what i can calculate over 5 000 live services in my lifetime and still not enough there's still a whole lot of work to do on this guy but i've been a part of some of the most powerful services that's ever been on the face of this earth and so have you i've i've been in over 5 000 live services in my lifetime i've heard some of the greatest some of the greatest men on earth give some of the most powerful sermons i've listened over thousands of tapes i've read scripture on top of scripture i've read quote on top of quote i've said here and i've listened to some of the greatest men of this world that have preached this message and to me the world doesn't hold a candle to what the preachers of this message preach but i have said and i have heard sermon after sermon where men of god begin to glorify god and you begin to watch as that man would glorify god and he would whip the devil every which way but every which way but up and yet in all of our life we still want more of it in all of the preaching that we've done we still yearn for more for all of the hearing that we hear we still long for more but i know that that at one point in my life that i was on a total different course than what it looks like that i was on today i was on my own path of life doing my own thing i was walking my own way at one point in my life i wanted to be a rodeo clown it's a far-fetched from where i am today but when i found out that brother timothy pruitt also had the same longing in life to be a rodeo clown i thought it's a match made in heaven but yet in all of that in all of that and when i was walking my way full-heartedly there was something on the inside of me that was pulling me in a total different direction and when i started to push with everything i had to run after my way the magnitation of the power of god and redemption began to pull me his way when i was pulling everything within my own self to get away from this word and get away from this i'd heard sermon on top of sermon i'd heard message on top a message but one day when i heard the voice of the living god calling out my name there was nothing on the inside of these 16 elements that could hold me back from going to that voice and i say to the church of the living god for your children and for your prodigals and for your sons and for your daughters don't you ever give up hope that when god goes to calling and when god goes to speak and if they are his they will come if they are still without the holy ghost if they're his he'll fill them and the same way with you sitting here tonight though you may be sitting here without the unction of the holy ghost though you may be sitting here without the anointing of almighty god upon your life you can walk out of here tonight with the same power that was there in the beginning that spoke worlds into existence that rode the worlds right off of his fingertips that same power wants to live in an earthen vessel and take over your life where you no longer live your own life that you could say like paul live the life that i once live that thing's in the past but the life that i now live hallelujah notice he says and what it takes to overcome all unbelief is our faith he said now there's a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets god a man can never be the same if he ever meets god face to face it will change him in spite of anything that you can do about it a man can never be the same after he once meets god now that's the truth now i want you to pay very special attention you know the subject that i'm speaking on but i want you to hear this word change that when you when you allow god to change your life that you're no longer the same and once you meet god you're no longer the same and that's the power of a sermon i'm going to give you a few trade secrets tonight that that the point of a sermon is not so that we get up here and we sound floweredly like we spent hours and study like we have but the power of a sermon is to see an earthen vessel changed no matter if it's healing no matter if it's sickness no matter if it's deliverance no matter no matter what the case is the point of a sermon is that you walk out of here changed and if this sermon don't change you it is completely in vain you know oftentimes as christians we come to church and we enjoy the preaching of the word we enjoy sermons we enjoy worshiping but many times we don't see the sermon for what it really is you hear a topic you hear a title but you don't really recognize the power of that sermon of what it really is and you'll hear us say now now don't take this service as just another service you see because many don't see the value of that sermon i'm not just preaching about this one but i'm preaching about every sermon this will help you this will help you when you're sitting there and you feel like man i could be somewhere else my stomach's growling i wish i ate the snickers before i came in here this sermon will help you tonight many times you walk in and you think this is just another service this is brother andrew again this is this is brother ron again this is this is brother william brother matthew these other men of god and many times you don't see the value of that sermon many people don't realize what it cost to preach a sermon they don't understand the life work that is behind this sermon now for this particular sermon i have been studying and grabbing and preparing for this sermon for over four weeks now but in this sermon you will hear things that have been taken me my whole life to grab out to grab that revelation it didn't just come in four weeks or it didn't just come in an hour and many times an audience doesn't grasp what is really transpiring in that sermon they don't understand the cause they don't understand the prayer that the pastors prayed they don't understand the struggles of of the people of god and then they don't understand the power of a word that was spoken at a right season to know that when that man got the utterance of the holy ghost to drop that sermon that anointed it with a spark of fire many times when you're sitting and you hear a sermon ask yourself why why is this sermon being released at this time you ever looked at a painting and looked at that painting said now now what did that artist what captured in his mind that would make him paint this portion of maybe a scripture or a place in the world what would capture him what would inspire him that he would draw out this painting and depict things in a certain way now you'll watch and you'll look at some people how that they paint jesus walking on the water and they'll grab from a different spot maybe they're grabbing from john or maybe they're grabbing from mark and they're catching separate spots but it's meaning something to them and they're trying to get your attention to look at the picture and when a sermon is coming forth why is that man preaching that why is he so moved why is he so passionate about what he's speaking we don't want to just hear the sermon we want to hear the inspiration of that sermon we want to really hear what god is saying behind the words it's more than my voice it's more than me standing behind this pulpit it's about hearing the voice behind the voice now i'm going to read you a quote here just a minute now a minister cannot bring a revival himself it takes god to send that revival it takes people his people who are willing to congregate themselves together and pray then he said i would hear from heaven if the people that are called by my name shall assemble themselves together and pray then he would hear from heaven and he would heal them and we know that his promises are true now this is more this is more than just catching this quote but if you'll go and look at where the prophet is speaking this he is not speaking this just anywhere but he is dropping this in his very first words that he's speaking right here in harrisonburg virginia and he is saying to a people within his very first words he starts dropping the power of a new birth the power the power of a people that if they would go to worshipping god that if you begin to call on his name and begin to congregate in his name now notice when this sermon is being released in 1958 right out here at the armory in harrisonburg virginia the building's still standing today there's many a people that are no longer connected with this message there were people that were there that are long gone but there are people sitting here today that knew that the minister didn't pack the revival it was a people that got on fire for god that begin to get under the anointing of the lord and they are the people the revival don't start here the sermon don't start here it starts in your home the revival don't start here the revival starts in your home oh hallelujah you see why full gospel lighthouse is the way she is it's because there is a people that know how to pray there is a people that know how to worship there is a people that know how to call on god it's more than a sermon now you see when a man of god comes with the word of god you can amend me tonight it won't scare me when a man comes with the word of god he's not just coming with scriptures he's not just coming with quotes he's coming with a thought he's coming with a message when that man of god gets so inspired that god would allow him to grab a hold of a of a scripture maybe it's one scripture maybe it's one quote that god so anoints this man of god to grab and go in there and maybe he'll grab that diamond and turn it just a little bit away and you'll sit there and say i've never heard it like that before in all of my life but you see that man of god got inspired so that he could turn that diamond so that you could like get that diamond and you could see the power of that diamond you see the man of god knows that if he can allow the holy spirit to take over and he could allow the holy spirit to go to expressing the power of that sermon now there's many times i preach sermons sometimes i preach 30 minutes you don't remember them lately but sometimes there are times when i preach 30 minutes 45 minutes but what i'm watching for i'm not looking to run out of material when i'm preaching i never run out of material but what i'm looking for sometimes i've even had to preach an hour and a half so you get it but what i'm watching for i'm not watching for your emotion i'm not watching for you to get excited i'm not watching for your amends i'm not running out of material i'm watching when the people of god catch the inspiration of that message and then a people get so inspired that they catch the expression of the word and then they go and make it live can you imagine how god felt when he rolled the worlds off of his fingertips but then to watch his son adam go and take the same word and begin to speak the spoken word and control nature and control life and say hey he's getting it he's doing what i did now when a man of god gets so anointed and he realizes that it's no longer him that is more than a sermon that the people are catching what the man is saying hallelujah that it's no longer on pages that it's no longer on a tablet that it's no more in a book but it's in a life you see this message is no good unless you take it off the pages this sermon will be no good to you if you just walk out of here like you never heard it in your life but this message has the power to change your life if you catch the inspiration you see that man of god knows that he can turn that diamond and that diamond gets lit up on the inside of your soul you see a diamond shines its best when it's put against darkness and satan has tried to stop the light out of your life but that diamond has been placed and the light of the pillar of fire is visible to make the diamond shine i want to tell you church you're a real ruby you're a real jewel you're a real jewel in the queen of heaven as the queen of heaven you have all power hallelujah watching him in creation that's my son that's my son i watched him i watched him as he moved that tree for eve when it was blocking her view that's my son i watched my son as he began to control the wind as it was blowing eve's hair a little too much you have that same power you have that same power and now is the time when sons are being manifested when you as a people of god start taking this word and when the enemy comes blowing against your soul and it seems like you're having a bad hair day and the wind's blowing your hair every which way you have the power of the spoken word in your life to control the storms of your life and one of these days that same voice will cause this body to resurrect hallelujah we're not just a people that's running with something we're a people running with a message running under a ministry of malachi 4 our hearts have been turned back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers our hearts are on fire we're running with a message of deliverance running with a message of healing running with a message of power and it will be this message that will change our bodies it's more than a message it's more than a sermon it's the life it's the life behind the sermon it's the life behind the picture sometimes all you see is a person that walks in and they walk in take their pew and they worship but you don't understand you don't understand the inspiration of their worship you don't understand the inspiration you don't understand what they went through where'd you get them scars yet where'd you get them scars at what made you this way what built you this way the music has got to be played out the sheet music has got to be played out and it may look like he's never going to look your way so that you can play your part but there is a god that created the sheet music and he knows when it's your part you stay steady this is more than just your average song this is more than just your average sermon you stay steady when the director turns his little he turns his little white stick and he starts pointing it your direction it's time for your miracle it's time for your healing [Applause] hallelujah when the director looks your way it's your time church this is more than a sermon the director is looking your way it's your time to play the music hallelujah it's this it's this sheet music that's going to change our bodies there's a lot of people that didn't want to sheet music there's a lot of people that didn't want this message there's a lot of people that didn't want these sermons hallelujah i had some of my best friends in this life say hey i don't want no part of it but it will be this sermon it will be this message that will change my body [Music] you're going to look at that word change now there's several several words for change in the bible you got to watch it sometimes in the english in the english you could catch it and it may not mean the same exact thing but there is one form of the greek word of change it's called a lasso and it means to exchange one thing for another i know that some of you sisters you go shopping and you go out and you buy yourself an article clothing i i know you ain't been to roses in a while many of you ain't going to walmart to shop maybe not even target but i'm sure that some of you had done gone to tj maxx but you're looking for this article of clothing you're looking for a new dress anybody mostly women women only raise your hand right here brothers you raise your hand you're looking for a dress we need to have a talk but you sister you're going you're looking for a new dress you want to come to church and you just want to look your best for the lord and you know the old saying is if you don't love it in the store you ain't going to love it at home so you're like you know what i think i can make that thing work and you bring it home and your husband said it ain't doing nothing for me and so you take it back you take it back and you take it back to tj maxx where you got this thing you walk back up that aisle say i'm here to exchange this for another i'm here to change this out i got to get some i get something that looks good for my husband and for the lord can i get amen hallelujah sisters it's coming up on valentine's day us brothers who take care of the flowers you take care of the dresses but you look hallelujah pastorship in the middle in the middle change hallelujah praise god but jim but build that nursery a little bit bigger but you're building you're looking you're looking for that one piece of article or clothing and you're looking for it i said you walked back in you got the receipt and you're saying i want to change this for another one you know that's what the bible says then in first corinthians chapter 15 i ain't talking about your clothing i'm talking about this body that in the moment in a twinkling of an eye you will exchange this one for another one this one didn't fit this one don't fit up there in that world that i was meant to go to i'm just simply exchanging one for the other where i'm going this body will not this body won't work but when i get that body i won't get tired i won't get sick i won't get worked up i won't get emotional tore up and nervous i will be perfect i think i'll make an exchange i got a receipt and it says it's paid for hallelujah hallelujah i'm going to change this corruption has got to put on incorruption and this mortal has got to put on immortality and it's going to take more than a sermon to put me there it's gonna take the same life of the second adam living in my body it's gonna take more than just a normal sermon to get that power on the inside of you he's going to take that life where you die out to yourself and you allow him to come in and you have an experience that you know that you know that you know that he's there i got good news for you if you know that he's there you know he ain't leaving because he never puts his stamp of approval on anything unless he loves what he's looking at they say oh i'm so tore up i'm so fearful you know what fear is it's faith in the enemy and when you start listening to what the devil's got to say you're putting your faith in the enemy i've got no reason to fear and put my faith in the enemy i got every reason to believe what god has said i'm not gonna leave you i'm not gonna forsake you i'll be with you i'll be in you i'll change your body god's word is his absolute he's not obligated to your flesh but he is obligated to his word and when there's a deposit that has been made he's obligated to it you don't have to run from his word you let the enemy do that you don't have to get shook up on the timing the vision's for an appointed time it's going to take place come on somebody he said we'd be there don't get shook up hallelujah he's going to get me there because he's obligated to his word now jesus said in matthew 24 that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away now if you look up that word pass away you can hear these things in future home it also means it also has a meaning of change and it means in the greek it is parashimi which means the passing from one to another it does not mean annihilate it does not mean totally destroyed but jesus said that heaven and earth will pass away they will pass away from one form to another but my word will never change from one form to another are you with me so we know that this earth has got to be changed before we come back to live in it in a millennium after the wedding supper of the lamb and it's going to take a holy fire brother branham said that that holy fire will come and it'll burn out the evil it'll burn out the politics hallelujah it'll go it'll create such a fire that the h2o will disintegrate in the air and the bible said that it will be a loud noise can you imagine the power of that fire when that fire gets to burning and that all the h2o gets so get so changed from one form to another you remember when isaiah was preaching in isaiah 65 he was bringing to you a sermon about your homeland he's telling you that i'm going to create god's creating a new heaven and a new earth he's telling you that the lion will lay down with the lamb you see what god is doing he's creating a fire on top of this earth that is going to completely destroy with a holy fire all the sin all the iniquities all the devils on this place and you what is god doing he is building a place for his church to live for a thousand years and his word will not return void unto him but it will accomplish what he sent it to do i got good news for you you're going to be there his church is going to be there sister sarah you're going to be there and i got just enough enough confidence in his word that he said that our offspring will be there with him that means our prodigals will be there that means our sons will be there our daughters will be there our grandchildren will be there hallelujah he is obligated to his word you are serving a god that believes his own word and you're also serving a god that loves to display his power he likes to show his muscles now satan don't like it when god goes to showing and displaying his power you see because satan thinks he's got a lot of power but he was finished at calvary all of his power is nothing but a bluff all it is is words all it is is you can basically call satan a big win back all he is he's got words he's basically like a dog that's on a chain and he ain't got no teeth he can bark all he wants to but he can't bite you he's been lying on you all your life why turn around and start putting your faith in him hallelujah why it's a time that the people of god start living start living above their god-given privileges and stop living below them and recognizing who they are you are more than a church it took more than a sermon to get you there but you're more than a church you're more than just a church on the side of a road sitting on 33 down here in elkton you're the bride of heaven and as the bride of heaven you know that he's your groom you know he's going to take care of you you know he's going to heal your body you know he's going to give you that baby you know he's gonna take care of you oh why don't you live like it well i live like it on saturday and sunday how about living like it all week long oh in the sweet by and by i'm just waiting brother andrew it ain't gonna work hallelujah if you wait to live right till you get over there i got bad news for you where you're at is not where you're wanting to go but if you can live like the sermon that you heard down here you won't just be a church you'll be more than a conqueror notice in mark chapter 11 he says have faith in god for verily i say unto you that if you say to this mountain be moved and plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you will say will come to pass you'll have whatever things you say is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church now you can express it by mental conception you can express these words by mental conception but if it becomes a real revelation of god that you see it before it happened are you with me you remember what i told you sometimes you got to hear things before you see things and when you allow the word of god to be a real revelation that you see it before it happened that's what faith is and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes a material a thought express your heart and your mind is so filled with god's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts i hear a prophet say don't take your thought take his thought you see when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct inspiration of the holy spirit that's moving your mortal being what kind of people should we be he asked us this question what kind of people should we be if the very holy spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts that you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the holy spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is god's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would we be we would be the word made flesh again now the bible says in first john 3 and 2 that now are we the sons of god he doesn't put it off somewhere in the future but he's telling you right now in this hour in this day there is a power that is setting in earthen vessels and that creator is in action the same one that rolled the worlds off of his fingertips you heard me say before can you imagine how god felt when he watched adam take that same word and start speaking those things that god gave adam he gave it to him to name all the beasts of the land he had such confidence in the first adam that he would name things according to their character he's got caught he had confidence in his second adam he had confidence that he would call them by their nature that they had in them and you watch when jesus was here on earth that he would call things by the nature that they had or by the characteristics that they had what did he do when those disciples were down there screaming said hey we ain't got we we don't know what happened here we tried to cast that thing off of him that epileptic spirit off of him but it didn't move jesus didn't mince words he told it exactly what it was he called it a devil and now you're watching the same second adam in body form speaking and calling things by their nature you're going to walk out of here tonight and you're going to say i got the same nature that the second adam had and i'm calling all of these lies of the devil i'm going to call these things a sickness it's a devil covet it's a devil depression it's a devil brain tumors it's a devil and those devils got to go in the name of jesus christ his wife now takes the same word satan come out that one clean spirit when you see a man of god this ain't never done before ever been done before in the face of the earth and it's done in front of the world you see a kentucky hillbilly stand behind a pulpit and start speaking good evening friends and demons start moving and he comes down to the end of the preaching and he stands there and says now you know i'm waiting on something i'm helpless as helpless can be unless he comes now he's here i now take every spirit under my control for the name of the lord that was not a man that was elohim that was the same one that was talking to those birds and those bees you fly here trees you land here it was the same one in the beginning standing right here in our day and there is a people hallelujah that are running with a message they're creating again saying little fishy come back to life if a possum could go to a prophet's doorstep what about the bride of jesus christ how much more should we lay before our lord as david said i'd rather lay before right before the door i'd rather be a rug than to dwell a parent that went into the tents of the wicked how much more should we lay before our lord that is faithful you are his wife you're creating again and you watched as tumors leave as you've seen squirrels come into existence when you've seen storms in colorado spoken out of existence when you've seen salvation given to boys when he's seen life given to a man by the name of doug hill when he sees salvation and deliverance coming to our young people what is it it's that same life coming into a body again that's controlling life that's controlling nature that's controlling sickness and overcoming hell overcoming demons overcoming the enemy it's the same life now you better destroy your enemy before he destroys you now notice we had a man of god come on the scene and tell science how cancer worked there has been there has been documentation of doctors that have said now we didn't know exactly we knew that the heart was built up in this way but when william branham started describing the organs he said he was describing what was on the inside of the man and here a prophet comes in demonology and he starts telling you what cancer is that cancer comes from the war from the word like a crab that when that cell is bruised he starts describing this thing out this this life of cancer that it grabs out and it grabs a hold of everything that it can grab he said now look what satan is doing he's building a life he says now he takes sale on top of sale see how close he works he works cell on top of sale and he takes one bruce cell and he comes and brother burnham said that he takes his shiny tiny older soldiers his tiny soldiers and he starts sending sale on top of sale on top of sale and starts contaminating you and all of a sudden that cancer has grown and that cancer has spread throughout the body what is it doing it's trying to stamp out the very life and he's trying to send you to a premature grave now look how close he look how close he watched he watched as these things are transpiring sell on top of sale and god is building himself a body and satan takes and he perverts brother branham said he's trying to build himself a life he has no authority to be there but he's on the inside of your cell now that cell was not meant to be there that cell was not meant to be there but because a sail got bruised all of a sudden the enemy comes with pus and sores and all of these things and he starts attacking that thing he starts sending all of his little soldiers towards this thing he said now he said now it's you watch that life he said now it's it's the enemy's job to bring sickness but it's your job to kick it out it's your job if satan can get that close in a vessel that god wants to fill and build sail on top of sail that satan wants to come and steal your life and build sail on top of sail that he can destroy your life there's got to be a power that you can tap into and destroy that life and jesus said in luke chapter 10 and verse 19 behold i give you power i've given you power that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven it's a time that the bride stands in her authority and she binds every demon of hell and looses the holy ghost on that situation hallelujah if satan's wanting to rob you of your life that bad that means you got value to god that means there's something laying there that he can't get you're more than a church you're a church jesus conquered all things if he didn't he didn't do his job if he's not god he's the greatest deceiver that the world's ever seen is that right if he didn't finish it all then what are we doing here but i stand in complete assurance tonight that when jesus said at the cross it is finished every devil is under his feet and you don't have to conquer the world no more he's already conquered it that makes you more than a conqueror nay and all these things we are more than conquerors what good is it going to you good for you to do to go hang on a cross your sins already paid for what good is it going to do for you to go and get beat over all the sin man sometimes you can get so down and so depressed it gets so shook up man i did something wrong man i did something bad i look back people look back through the history of their life they get so beat up that if they could go to pilot's judgment hall they'd walk right there what good is that going to do you when he's already been beat for you when he's already been whipped for you what good's he going to do when jesus already paid for it how are you going to pay for it hallelujah when you look through the book of hebrews it tells us that the promises of god are more and better and the bible said that once and for all he's paid for your sin you ain't got to go to the cross you ain't got to go to hell jesus paid it now when i walk out a restaurant i now i have to tell you i enjoy eating good i enjoy my steaks and i enjoy my ice cream maybe a little bit better than some people should but when i walk into an establishment and i walk in there if i want to order a porterhouse i'm gonna order a porterhouse when it comes down to it if i want to order me a hershey bar a brownie with the ice cream on top of it with a cherry on top of it i'm gonna get it if i want to and when i leave there if i've paid the bill gave my tip i walk out of there in full assurance that ain't nobody coming after me because i paid for my bill now i i you you've done it many of you done it for me and i thank you very much you ain't got to do it there's been many times i walk down here to see rose and i go to pay the bill and somebody they look at me say somebody's done took care of it for you you must be a light guy so i don't know why i don't know who did that but i think you know if i knew that it was one of you and i got confidence in you that you got money to pay for it i can walk out of there the same assurance as i walked out when i paid for it because it's already been paid for are you with me most of you know how to work and most of you know how to save your money if you don't you need to learn how to but most of you know how to save your money and you know how to get a blessing and if you pay for my meal i can walk out of there with full assurance that the bill has already been paid for and i know ain't nobody coming after me now there's some people i'm a little bit skeptical you better check again that may give you a fake 20. i'm not talking about anybody here look you go in my business walk in my world just a little bit time it's scary it makes you be a preacher but there's some people that you wouldn't dare walk out say hey i got you today you wouldn't dare walk out of zeros on their word but when jesus said i paid for it when jesus said i took care of it you can walk out in full assurance that he took care of it you ain't gotta look behind you the devil ain't even follow you because surely goodness and mercy are following you all the days of your life and the enemy has been stripped of his power jesus paid for it cancer's been paid for broken wounds have been paid for broken homes have been paid for cancer's been paid for tuberculosis been paid for let me nail it down covet has been paid for every strand of coffee has been paid for why should we put our faith in the enemy when we should put all our faith in god he said i got you i got you i pray for this well if he walked out of the grave i'mma walk into oh if he walked out of the grave i'mma walk into if he walked out of the grave i'mma walk into [Music] cause there ain't no grave gonna hold my body down oh hallelujah if he walked out with forest herds why shouldn't the bride of jesus christ walk out in full authority it's been paid for i'm more than a church i'm more than a cochran let's say oh hallelujah go to praise in the lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it's more than a sermon you're more than a church and you're more of the cockroach that means that you're more you've got enough abundance of life that we abundantly overcome i hear a prophet say it's not necessarily what you are to come as long as you know how to overcome hallelujah and overcoming is recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks what's attacking you what's attacking you if it ain't of god it's the enemy you can walk out of here with four shorts and i i'm more i'm more i'm more than just a church on the side of the hill i've heard more than a message i've heard more than a voice i've heard the voice behind the voice i'm more than just a church i'm more than a cochran more than a cochran oh maybe we sing that song tonight we've been made more than conquerors we've been made more than conquerors [Music] overcomers in this [Music] [Music] o through the blood of jesus christ oh we've been making
