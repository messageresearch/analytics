[46:47] God bless you if you'll turn with me in
[46:48] your scriptures this morning
[46:51] Luke chapter 11 and verse 17.
[46:55] I'd like to continue the thought of
[46:58] no fault
[47:02] and I'd like to look today at two books
[47:08] every one of us have two books
[47:11] there was an old
[47:13] and there was a new
[47:15] that was awesome
[47:17] amen
[47:20] Luke Chapter 11
[47:23] and verse 17.
[47:25] brother Stephen has already sung my
[47:27] sermon now I'm going to preach it to you
[47:33] Jesus now
[47:35] but he knowing their thoughts what a
[47:38] statement right there
[47:40] but he knowing their thoughts
[47:43] said unto them
[47:45] every Kingdom divided against itself is
[47:49] brought to desolation
[47:52] and A house divided against a house
[47:55] follow
[47:57] if Satan also be divided against himself
[48:01] how shall his kingdom stand because you
[48:05] say that I cast out Devils through
[48:08] Beelzebub
[48:11] but if I by Beelzebub
[48:16] cast out devils
[48:19] by whom do your sons
[48:22] cast them out quite a powerful twist
[48:27] therefore
[48:29] they shall be your judges
[48:33] but if I with the Finger of God cast out
[48:36] devils
[48:37] no doubt the kingdom of God
[48:40] is come unto you
[48:44] when a strong man armed keepeth his
[48:48] Palace
[48:49] his goods are in peace
[48:51] but when a stronger than he shall come
[48:55] unto him and overcometh him
[48:58] he taketh from him all of his armor
[49:01] wherein he trusted and divided is false
[49:06] he that is not with me
[49:08] is against me and he that gathereth not
[49:13] with me scattereth
[49:15] notice these next verses when the
[49:18] unclean spirit is gone out of a man
[49:21] he walketh through Dry places and
[49:23] seeketh rest and findeth none and he
[49:26] saith I will return unto my house once I
[49:30] came out
[49:31] and when he cometh he findeth that swept
[49:34] and garnished then goeth he and take it
[49:37] took him seven other Spirits more wicked
[49:40] than himself and they enter in and dwell
[49:43] there
[49:44] and the last estate of that man is worse
[49:49] than the first
[49:52] that is why we must have the Holy Ghost
[49:57] you have a need this morning I'd like to
[49:58] just if you just lift your hands before
[50:00] the Lord and let's just take it to God
[50:02] and say Lord come by and meet my needs
[50:05] Heavenly Father we love you with all of
[50:08] our hearts
[50:09] we have already felt Jesus in the room
[50:12] this morning
[50:13] what a day that lays before us as Sons
[50:16] and Daughters of God lord we ask you to
[50:19] come by and touch every need touch every
[50:21] heart touch the sickness of the people
[50:24] that have been sick this week and those
[50:27] that are that are have great needs and
[50:29] are at home we ask you that you'd
[50:31] stretch forth your hand of mercy and we
[50:34] pray this upon the authority of the name
[50:37] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[50:40] amenity man let's have church
[50:44] amen you can be seated
[50:48] the scripture says in Romans chapter 8
[50:50] in verse verse 1.
[50:54] verse chapter 7 talks about it divorced
[50:57] from our first nature
[50:59] talks about the old man being dead
[51:02] but in the next sermon or the next
[51:04] chapter he preaches
[51:06] and he starts out with this sentence
[51:08] there is therefore now no condemnation
[51:14] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[51:18] walk not after the flesh but after the
[51:22] spirit
[51:24] isn't it wonderful
[51:27] I read this the other day and I thought
[51:29] it was good and I'll bring it to you
[51:31] during the national observance
[51:34] of the 100th anniversary of the Statue
[51:36] of Liberty in New York Harbor
[51:39] I was I was stuck struck
[51:43] by the great emphasis of a number of
[51:46] immigrants
[51:47] who had often left their behind their
[51:50] country behind Coming To America with
[51:52] nothing but their clothes on their back
[51:55] they risked their lives for something
[51:57] that they valued more highly than
[52:00] everything that they left behind
[52:03] freedom
[52:05] they did not take their adopted
[52:07] country's hard-won freedom for granted
[52:10] neither do must we
[52:12] their experience is a picture of what we
[52:15] must do when we come to Jesus Christ
[52:18] we must forsake our alliance to this
[52:22] world and its Allegiance
[52:24] leave behind all that it offers and
[52:27] become citizens of the kingdom of God
[52:30] the kingdom of God the stature of
[52:33] Liberty is in the form of a cross
[52:36] the statue on New York Harbor lifts up
[52:39] her lamps beside of a golden door
[52:42] the statue of the Liberty on that Hill
[52:44] called Jerusalem
[52:46] lights up our way to eternal life
[52:52] Hallelujah
[52:54] we today stand here
[52:57] as redeemed
[53:00] we are not what we were
[53:06] we are not identified with the old
[53:08] nature anymore
[53:10] we have become divorced from that nature
[53:13] we have become changed and we stand here
[53:17] as new creatures in Christ Jesus
[53:21] many times we look like the same fella
[53:24] that sinned and did all those evil
[53:26] things while we were alienated from the
[53:28] Commonwealth of God that though now
[53:31] we're maybe gray or in her head our
[53:34] shoulders are a little bit more stooped
[53:36] our walk our gate is a little bit slower
[53:38] but there's a new king that's living on
[53:41] the inside of our heart
[53:42] our tongue doesn't speak the same our
[53:46] mind doesn't speak the say think the
[53:49] same our eyes don't look at things that
[53:51] we used to look at
[53:53] our feet don't carry us to bar rooms and
[53:57] dances and all different kind of things
[53:59] of the world but it carries us to church
[54:03] we become leaders in our homes women
[54:06] become real pastors there to where they
[54:09] teach their children the things of God
[54:13] children grow up in an environment not
[54:16] of drinking and cussing and fighting
[54:18] with moms and dads but they grow up in a
[54:21] home of Prayer
[54:23] they grow up in a home of an environment
[54:25] of peace
[54:28] when they go to school they hear a
[54:30] families that have great difficulties
[54:32] we're not those families
[54:34] but if those families had Jesus
[54:38] you see the difference is more than just
[54:40] a message the message is Jesus Christ
[54:43] revealed it's more than books and tapes
[54:46] pictures on the wall but it's a
[54:49] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost living
[54:51] inside of our lives
[54:55] Jeremiah says in chapter 1 and verse 5
[54:59] before I form thee in the belly I knew
[55:02] thee
[55:04] and before thou cameest out of the womb
[55:06] I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a
[55:10] prophet unto the Nations it was more
[55:13] than just Jeremiah but God watched over
[55:15] you in your mother's womb
[55:17] he watched over you all the way from
[55:20] Adam and protected your seed and if he
[55:22] could do that for thousands of years how
[55:25] much more can he help you today
[55:29] Jesus is preaching to Nicodemus
[55:32] Nicodemus being a secret believer
[55:36] the scripture says in verse 2 of Chapter
[55:38] 3 of John the saying came to Jesus by
[55:42] night and said unto him Rabbi we know
[55:45] that thou art a teacher come from God
[55:47] for no man can do these Miracles that
[55:50] thou doest except God be with him
[55:54] now Jesus turns
[55:56] Jesus answered and said unto him
[55:59] verily Burly I say unto thee
[56:03] except a man be born again
[56:09] he cannot see the kingdom of heaven
[56:13] kingdom of God
[56:15] God strictly spells out in several
[56:17] different places of the scriptures
[56:19] there'll be no idolaters in heaven
[56:22] there'll be no fornicators Heaven
[56:24] there'll be no murderers in heaven
[56:26] there'll be none of those kind
[56:29] what a place that that's going to be
[56:31] like
[56:32] there'll be no line there'll be no
[56:34] cheating there will be no Stealing In
[56:36] Heaven there'll be no adultery in heaven
[56:38] there'll be no murders in Heaven There
[56:41] not be a hospital there there'll be no
[56:44] need for a courtroom there will be no
[56:46] jail cells there
[56:48] what a place why wouldn't you want to go
[56:51] to a place like that
[56:57] Luke chapter 14 and verse 16. then saith
[57:01] unto him
[57:02] a certain man made a great supper and
[57:05] made many
[57:06] and since since servants at supper time
[57:09] to say to him that were bidden come
[57:13] for all things are now ready
[57:17] and they were all with one consent begin
[57:19] to make excuse
[57:21] these people were qualified Jesus is
[57:25] making an analogy of going to heaven
[57:29] these people were qualified but they
[57:32] made excuses
[57:34] there will be people that are more smart
[57:36] than you better looking than you have
[57:39] greater education to you have more money
[57:44] but they made excuses why not to serve
[57:47] God
[57:54] and the first set I bought a piece of
[57:56] ground
[57:57] and I must need to go see it and I pray
[57:59] that you have any excuse and another
[58:01] said I bought a five auctioned yoga box
[58:04] and I must go prove them and I pray they
[58:07] have an excuse and another said I have
[58:10] married a wife and therefore I cannot
[58:13] come
[58:15] foreign
[58:17] came and showed his Lord these things
[58:20] then the master of the house being angry
[58:22] said to his servants go out quickly into
[58:25] the streets and the lanes of the city
[58:27] and bring them hither to the poor the
[58:30] man the heart and the blind
[58:35] he found us
[58:38] he found us in many cases we weren't
[58:41] qualified
[58:44] Hallelujah Brother Ray he found us
[58:48] he found where you were at and he
[58:50] gathered us to the table
[58:55] and the servant said Lord it is done as
[58:57] thou has commanded and yet there is room
[58:59] and the Lord said go you into highways
[59:01] and hedges compel them to come
[59:04] that my house may be filled
[59:07] and I say unto you that none of those
[59:10] men which were bidden
[59:12] shall taste
[59:13] of my supper
[59:17] let's just look at it just for a moment
[59:19] with the woman at the well
[59:22] be qualified
[59:24] in many of the circles of the Pharisees
[59:27] and the sadducee
[59:29] I dare not
[59:30] the woman that washes Jesus's feet
[59:36] I dare say not
[59:39] a a naked preacher
[59:42] cursing
[59:44] using Blasphemous names
[59:46] that will will will will will literally
[59:49] try to cut a man's head off with a sword
[59:53] I'd say he wouldn't be welcoming the
[59:56] circles of the Pharisees or the
[59:58] Sadducees
[1:00:00] because in their circles they wouldn't
[1:00:02] be qualified
[1:00:07] Hallelujah
[1:00:09] watch this
[1:00:10] but you're just
[1:00:12] but you're just then did it in condition
[1:00:16] to find Jesus he's talking about
[1:00:18] Zacchaeus
[1:00:20] he said when you lose that reputation
[1:00:23] that you think that is so high and so
[1:00:27] classy and everything
[1:00:30] you're just about getting ready to find
[1:00:34] Jesus
[1:00:35] when you get that starch that has been
[1:00:38] taken out of you that is when you're
[1:00:40] getting ready to find Jesus
[1:00:45] Zach just said uh I'll get up in that
[1:00:47] tree before somebody else comes
[1:00:50] so he climbs and twists and he gets up
[1:00:52] in the tree and finally gets up there no
[1:00:55] that limb won't hold me and he looks
[1:00:57] there for two limbs to meet and he come
[1:01:00] to a place right there's the place where
[1:01:02] it meet me a good solid place that's the
[1:01:05] place where you sit that's the way meets
[1:01:08] you yours and God that's where your
[1:01:11] change comes and he sets down on the
[1:01:13] limb setting there garbage stink all
[1:01:17] over him
[1:01:18] splinters in his hands a businessman of
[1:01:21] the city Zacchaeus a great man but he's
[1:01:25] determined to see Jesus
[1:01:28] but his determined to see Jesus God can
[1:01:32] get you into some horrible shape
[1:01:35] sometimes but if you can get away get
[1:01:39] determined to see Jesus you'll see him
[1:01:50] and sometimes we come with a lot of
[1:01:52] garbage on us
[1:01:54] we got a history to us
[1:01:57] the prophet says here sometime ago
[1:02:00] they had the religions of the world to
[1:02:03] meet
[1:02:03] he said I was reading it in a book
[1:02:06] they had this little lady Maccabee from
[1:02:09] Oklahoma that was arrested out there
[1:02:12] might have been Tulsa or one of those
[1:02:14] places she's running through the streets
[1:02:16] driving stage coaches smoking a cigar
[1:02:19] breaking the speed limits with a
[1:02:21] stagecoach and all the religions of the
[1:02:24] world raised up and told their part of
[1:02:27] their religion how great it was the
[1:02:29] Muhammad priest told how great his
[1:02:31] religion was Buddha told how great his
[1:02:33] religion was a certain Minister I can't
[1:02:36] call his name now was represented the
[1:02:38] religion of America Christian Church
[1:02:40] when he got up at time for his platform
[1:02:42] he told the story of this great foul
[1:02:45] woman how low down that she was now she
[1:02:49] couldn't want nobody wanted her to be
[1:02:51] around her to even get so close to her
[1:02:54] they would turn and feather her she was
[1:02:57] immoral
[1:02:58] she was so degraded there's nothing that
[1:03:01] could help her and he said Gentlemen of
[1:03:04] the religions of this world and what
[1:03:07] your religions can produce
[1:03:09] can anything that you've got cleanse the
[1:03:13] hands of this vowel person
[1:03:15] everybody set tight
[1:03:18] set still
[1:03:20] right on the hands of their seats no one
[1:03:22] said nothing then jumping up in the air
[1:03:25] screaming and kicking his heels
[1:03:27] backwards and forwards he said the blood
[1:03:29] of Jesus Christ
[1:03:31] won't only cleanse her hands but it'll
[1:03:34] cleanse her heart
[1:03:36] and make her pure as a lily
[1:03:39] the blood of our Jesus Christ takes away
[1:03:42] sin and cleanses us from all of our
[1:03:45] iniquity and makes us creatures of
[1:03:47] Christ Jesus nothing else will do it
[1:03:50] Creeds won't do it
[1:03:52] former religion won't do it nothing else
[1:03:56] will make your play take its place it
[1:03:59] takes the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] Hallelujah
[1:04:09] Hallelujah
[1:04:17] Eve tried to hybrid the word
[1:04:21] in the beginning God told her the day
[1:04:23] you eat your thereof that day you die
[1:04:26] she tried to breed it with knowledge
[1:04:29] that Satan Giver
[1:04:31] and when she did she lost that whole
[1:04:33] human race
[1:04:35] to the devil when she tried to mix God's
[1:04:38] unadulterated word with knowledge it
[1:04:41] doesn't come from knowledge of the world
[1:04:43] it comes from the power of the Holy
[1:04:46] Ghost
[1:04:48] it is not by power it is not by might
[1:04:52] but by my spirit saith the Lord that's
[1:04:55] how God does it God's word is a seed of
[1:04:59] eternal life and you try to hybrid it
[1:05:04] let me just say this when you try to
[1:05:06] polish God's word up and bring Hollywood
[1:05:09] into it
[1:05:10] when you try to make it to where it will
[1:05:13] fit with the Society of today you hybrid
[1:05:16] it and take the life out of it
[1:05:24] he said that'll kill it it won't mix no
[1:05:27] more like oil and water won't mix it
[1:05:29] will not do it
[1:05:30] they have never in all the way tried to
[1:05:33] find anything better than God's way of
[1:05:36] doing it you know they've never found a
[1:05:38] way better than for a chicken to be born
[1:05:41] into this world than to Peck its way out
[1:05:45] of its shell
[1:05:48] we're country people we understand that
[1:05:50] if you if you let him pick his way out
[1:05:53] he'll live
[1:05:55] if you try to break it and make it
[1:05:58] easier for him he will have the strength
[1:06:00] to live
[1:06:02] it's the same way with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] birth you got to die out to yourself
[1:06:09] it's not by shaking a preacher's hand
[1:06:11] it's not by joining a church you'll go
[1:06:14] right back into the world the same you
[1:06:16] come and you'll be nothing but a mixture
[1:06:19] but when you die out to yourself
[1:06:24] brother Ron but I never smoked I never
[1:06:26] drank I never done anything in the world
[1:06:28] you're still as much all have sinned and
[1:06:31] come short of the glory of God you still
[1:06:34] need a new birth in your life
[1:06:36] where you pray to that old nature that
[1:06:39] old self Will dies out
[1:06:42] a real death to worry that first king of
[1:06:46] your heart dies
[1:06:48] and the new King Jesus comes and lives
[1:06:51] on the inside of your heart
[1:07:01] I'm afraid too many lazy soft suit
[1:07:04] watered-down preachers want to soft soap
[1:07:07] it so much until where there's no dying
[1:07:10] out anymore
[1:07:12] that's why churches look like the world
[1:07:14] walk like a world talk like the world
[1:07:16] but we need to die out to our own nature
[1:07:23] men of God
[1:07:25] we must display a life
[1:07:28] a life worthy of the Gospel of Jesus
[1:07:31] Christ
[1:07:33] let me just say this to you it comes to
[1:07:36] a point to where you can say from that
[1:07:39] time
[1:07:42] that point where you met him
[1:07:45] that anchor where something changed in
[1:07:49] your life
[1:07:50] every one of us will have a different
[1:07:52] experience
[1:07:54] and there's no way for us to explain a
[1:07:58] supernatural experience of God how did
[1:08:01] you get it well I really can't explain
[1:08:03] it
[1:08:06] it happened
[1:08:08] he came
[1:08:10] and when he came
[1:08:12] it just changed my life
[1:08:14] maybe you're standing on the street of
[1:08:16] Victoria when your life gets changed
[1:08:18] maybe it's on a Wednesday night that
[1:08:20] your life gets changed maybe it's a
[1:08:22] Saturday night after a service last
[1:08:24] night and you just know I'm not the same
[1:08:26] man no more
[1:08:28] in a moment of his presence it changes
[1:08:30] your life
[1:08:31] let me just say this to you whether
[1:08:33] you're the banker whether you're the
[1:08:35] lawyer whether you're the king you still
[1:08:38] need Jesus
[1:08:40] mother Brown goes down in pig island he
[1:08:42] walks through and he meets a man that's
[1:08:45] laying in the ditch he's a drunk
[1:08:48] and he began to ask him where it all
[1:08:50] started and he said he started out with
[1:08:52] one little social drink
[1:08:56] now he's lost his job he's lost his home
[1:08:58] he's lost his family and he finds
[1:09:01] himself in pig alley
[1:09:03] that man was standing before
[1:09:05] eternal life
[1:09:07] we don't have the end of that story but
[1:09:09] he was standing before a chance at
[1:09:12] eternal life let me just say don't miss
[1:09:15] your opportunity
[1:09:20] don't miss your opportunity in Hell
[1:09:23] tonight there are people that would love
[1:09:26] to take our places
[1:09:28] the celebrities of hell would like to
[1:09:31] have one service like we're sitting in
[1:09:33] today they would give it all up
[1:09:36] [Music]
[1:09:41] Jesus had a Rich Young Ruler come near
[1:09:43] him
[1:09:46] had a good home
[1:09:48] had a good family
[1:09:50] you can listen to it in leadership
[1:09:52] brother man who said he had a good
[1:09:53] father that taught him business had a
[1:09:55] good mother that taught him the word of
[1:09:57] God he had all the fundamentals down
[1:09:59] but he came to the right source of
[1:10:02] eternal life
[1:10:03] and when Jesus saw him he loved him
[1:10:09] Jesus loved him
[1:10:11] but he told him and told him said sell
[1:10:13] all that you have and give it to the
[1:10:16] poor and come follow me
[1:10:19] that was too much
[1:10:22] that was too much how many people have
[1:10:25] said in our churches all across the
[1:10:27] world
[1:10:28] and because of the rigidity of the life
[1:10:35] I don't find it hard but a lot of people
[1:10:37] find walking this way difficult
[1:10:43] but I want you to understand what
[1:10:44] brother Ron but it's difficult to dress
[1:10:46] like the sister's dress well I don't
[1:10:48] dress like the sisters
[1:10:53] but they become ladies
[1:10:55] ladies of society real queens walking on
[1:11:00] the Earth
[1:11:02] now we don't have to make our sisters
[1:11:04] we're not reformers
[1:11:07] Wesley and them were reformers they had
[1:11:09] to reform but we're Transformers
[1:11:13] we preach in the word and the word
[1:11:15] transforms your life
[1:11:18] listen it's easy when you get Jesus
[1:11:22] it's easy it changes your music it
[1:11:25] changes your lifestyle it changes what
[1:11:28] you watch
[1:11:31] changes the friends that you're with
[1:11:34] well brother Ron I'm afraid I'll lose my
[1:11:36] friends listen they're not your friends
[1:11:39] if they're leading you to hell they're
[1:11:40] not your friends
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:50] when the money runs out you'll find out
[1:11:53] who your friends are
[1:11:55] when you're no longer supplying the
[1:11:57] droughts you'll find out who your
[1:11:58] friends are when you're no longer
[1:12:00] drinking their booze You'll Find Out Who
[1:12:02] Your Friends Are
[1:12:08] a little girl was carrying her Bible in
[1:12:11] the school
[1:12:12] the biggest bully of the school came up
[1:12:14] to her and was making fun of her
[1:12:17] and she said I believe that I have more
[1:12:19] power than you do he laughed and made
[1:12:22] all manner of fun of her and she said
[1:12:24] carry this
[1:12:31] carry this
[1:12:32] and that's six foot six bully
[1:12:37] went to church where she went to
[1:12:41] he was so drunk he fell in the hedges
[1:12:45] when he walked into the build of about
[1:12:47] 12 people he found his way to Jesus
[1:12:50] Christ
[1:12:54] that man become a real Christian
[1:12:56] let me just save this to you when you
[1:12:58] find the real reason to live
[1:13:02] I'm afraid we preach way too many
[1:13:04] funerals where people have never lived
[1:13:08] they live 50 60 70 years but they never
[1:13:11] lived if you don't live for Jesus you've
[1:13:13] never lived
[1:13:24] I want to talk to you about when you
[1:13:26] came to the Earth
[1:13:28] sometimes I don't think this is fair but
[1:13:31] this God makes the rules
[1:13:33] when you're born
[1:13:36] you were born shaped in iniquity
[1:13:39] the sins of your father was
[1:13:42] automatically on you
[1:13:48] they were passed down from the
[1:13:49] generations and all of their nonsenses
[1:13:52] now you're guilty of
[1:13:56] because you're born of sexual desire and
[1:14:00] sexual makings and now the sins all the
[1:14:04] way since Adam through your heritage are
[1:14:06] you're now guilty of let me explain it
[1:14:09] to you
[1:14:10] if I'm going down the road and I'm doing
[1:14:12] 90 miles an hour
[1:14:17] and the law pulls me over
[1:14:20] and gives me a ticket
[1:14:22] then my son is responsible to pay for it
[1:14:32] I don't know who it would be
[1:14:35] it doesn't seem fair that the
[1:14:38] Bootleggers or the dope addicts of the
[1:14:40] family
[1:14:42] or the illegitimacy was pulled down into
[1:14:45] your life
[1:14:46] every family here had a lot of nonsense
[1:14:49] in your history
[1:14:51] so don't put on no wings right here
[1:14:54] every one of you were born in sin every
[1:14:58] one of you had a past book in your life
[1:15:00] and there was a lot written down on the
[1:15:03] inside of there and we were guilty
[1:15:07] we were guilty and had we died in that
[1:15:11] condition we would have went to a
[1:15:13] devil's Health but God rich in Mercy
[1:15:23] God rich in Mercy it wasn't by your
[1:15:27] Deeds it wasn't by your goodness
[1:15:31] had a predestinated seed that he elected
[1:15:35] in you before the foundation of the
[1:15:37] world
[1:15:49] it's kind of like a credit card
[1:15:53] when God rich in Mercy saves you
[1:15:56] it doesn't give you the license to go by
[1:15:59] consume
[1:16:02] we're not making Grace a disgrace
[1:16:07] it's just like a 25 000 credit card bill
[1:16:10] you'll never pay it off
[1:16:13] you'll never pay it off just paying the
[1:16:15] little bit that's the way the devil will
[1:16:17] do to you
[1:16:18] just try to reform yourself a little bit
[1:16:20] and just pay the minimum off you'll
[1:16:22] never get it paid off it's not designed
[1:16:25] that way but somebody came and paid your
[1:16:27] debt for you
[1:16:29] God left Heaven's glory and came to the
[1:16:32] Earth and died the sinner's death and
[1:16:35] God sent him to hell
[1:16:37] so you wouldn't have to go there
[1:16:47] when God takes us through the Old
[1:16:49] Testament
[1:16:53] when you think about the characters the
[1:16:55] outstanding characters of the Old
[1:16:57] Testament
[1:17:00] their names their life
[1:17:03] actually probably less is mentioned than
[1:17:07] his setting in this building
[1:17:16] but what if Rahab been welcome
[1:17:20] in the local church
[1:17:25] what a and a murderer
[1:17:27] named Moses
[1:17:29] be welcome
[1:17:30] in the local church
[1:17:33] what if David that
[1:17:35] took his best friend's wife and had a
[1:17:39] child by and it caused death to come all
[1:17:42] through his family
[1:17:48] would have Esther
[1:17:49] who hid her identification
[1:17:52] that she was a Jew
[1:17:55] but unwelcome at a lot of churches
[1:17:59] God who is rich in Mercy
[1:18:02] had a prophet to stand
[1:18:05] at an auction
[1:18:10] and built on a harlot
[1:18:14] and know about the critics stood there
[1:18:17] and said look over there the old
[1:18:20] preacher
[1:18:22] has come to the auction today
[1:18:25] and it's not only here but he's bidding
[1:18:28] on a harlot
[1:18:33] but God sent him there to tell him what
[1:18:36] the church world was like
[1:18:39] and that God had Redemption for her
[1:18:44] you ought to be preaching with me right
[1:18:46] now
[1:18:46] you ought to be preaching with me right
[1:18:48] now
[1:18:49] aren't you glad that in our condition
[1:18:54] God didn't look at what you were he was
[1:18:57] looking at the seed that was on the
[1:18:59] inside of you
[1:19:03] and it was like a deep calling to the
[1:19:05] deep and there was a deep to respond to
[1:19:08] it
[1:19:13] um mm-hmm
[1:19:18] Jesus turns to Simon Peter and he said
[1:19:21] Simon behold Satan hath desired to have
[1:19:24] you I'd like to say this to you Satan
[1:19:26] would desire to have our young people
[1:19:28] but we've made a declaration you can't
[1:19:30] have them
[1:19:42] but he says I have prayed for thee that
[1:19:44] thy faith fail not
[1:19:47] foreign
[1:19:48] now he's been with him help me he's been
[1:19:51] with him
[1:19:52] for three years
[1:19:54] three and a half possibly
[1:19:59] you would think that Peter's converting
[1:20:02] most people sitting in church for three
[1:20:04] and a half years they assume that I'm
[1:20:06] converting
[1:20:13] and Jesus said you're not even converted
[1:20:15] yet
[1:20:17] foreign
[1:20:19] laying before this statement Peter's
[1:20:22] going to deny the Lord Thrice
[1:20:26] he's going to use abominable cursing
[1:20:30] that would condemn him to hell
[1:20:33] Stay With Me Now
[1:20:37] he's going to grab a sword out of the
[1:20:40] enemy and try to cut his head off
[1:20:43] and then Jesus is going to tell him get
[1:20:45] behind me Satan
[1:20:47] because God's Got A Plan
[1:20:50] and then he takes that man's ear and
[1:20:52] puts it back on his head and heals the
[1:20:54] man I don't know how that man can
[1:20:56] continue to be the critic of Jesus
[1:20:58] Christ
[1:21:01] after you see a phenomenal Miracle like
[1:21:03] that lay it on the ground and he puts
[1:21:05] his ear back on him and he and he's
[1:21:07] still is a Critic of Jesus Christ don't
[1:21:10] tell me how can you
[1:21:16] but Jesus didn't look at he knew his
[1:21:19] future but he didn't look at his
[1:21:21] mistakes
[1:21:23] aren't you glad tonight that when God
[1:21:26] looks at you he don't look at your
[1:21:28] mistakes he don't look at your failures
[1:21:31] he looks at your sacrifice
[1:21:34] [Applause]
[1:21:36] that ought to be a United
[1:21:38] unanimous hang on the chandelier moment
[1:21:42] God don't look at my mistakes
[1:21:55] God don't look at my face
[1:21:57] past present and future
[1:22:01] God looks at my lamb
[1:22:06] First Corinthians 6 and verse 9 know you
[1:22:09] not that the unrighteous shall not
[1:22:11] inherit the kingdom of God
[1:22:14] be not deceived neither fornicators or
[1:22:16] adulterers our idolaters are feminine or
[1:22:19] abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:22:21] that's talking about Sodom if you really
[1:22:24] want to know nor thieves nor covenants
[1:22:26] or drunkards nor revilers nor
[1:22:29] extortioners or shall inherit the
[1:22:32] kingdom of God
[1:22:33] and search where some of you
[1:22:38] I want you to say that statement with me
[1:22:40] and search where some
[1:22:45] now look at your neighbor and such were
[1:22:49] some of you
[1:22:50] this time I want you to do it with your
[1:22:52] finger with you just like that right
[1:22:54] there I'll and search were some of you
[1:22:58] you know what you did you just pointed
[1:23:00] three fingers back at yourself
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:09] always remember when you're pointing
[1:23:11] your finger at somebody else
[1:23:13] three of them are pointing back at you
[1:23:15] you just outboarded yourself
[1:23:22] notice what he says but you are watched
[1:23:28] you're Justified
[1:23:30] but you're sanctified
[1:23:32] and you but you are justified in the
[1:23:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the
[1:23:37] spirit of our God
[1:23:39] Ezekiel 36 and verse 26 a new heart also
[1:23:45] will I give you
[1:23:47] and a new spirit will I put within you
[1:23:49] and I will take the Stony heart out of
[1:23:52] your flesh and I will give you a heart
[1:23:54] of Flesh and I will put my spirit within
[1:23:57] you cause you can cause you to walk in
[1:24:00] my statues and you shall keep my
[1:24:03] judgment and do them
[1:24:06] I want to just tell you this
[1:24:08] with God we have a red jury
[1:24:15] this is a completely rigged courtroom
[1:24:19] Jesus Christ became our lawyer
[1:24:22] our judge and our jury
[1:24:30] let me just think about this just for a
[1:24:32] moment
[1:24:33] what a difficulty that Satan must have
[1:24:38] you know let's just have a feel sorry
[1:24:39] for Satan moment
[1:24:44] so okay let's have a feel sorry for
[1:24:46] Satan moment then we're going to beat
[1:24:48] the fire out of him
[1:24:51] so here is he's got all the history of
[1:24:54] your forefathers and he's got it all
[1:24:56] written down
[1:24:57] he's kept Good Records
[1:25:00] and you've been a lot of nonsense in
[1:25:02] your life
[1:25:04] and then one mountain in his presence in
[1:25:07] the presence of Jesus Christ he takes
[1:25:10] all of that
[1:25:11] and erases it
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:18] and then God says when the accuser of
[1:25:21] the Brethren comes up to him and he
[1:25:23] tells him all your thoughts and your
[1:25:25] failures and God says let me look at my
[1:25:27] book
[1:25:29] and he looks through the blood of Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ
[1:25:36] and then Satan says look at here and
[1:25:38] Jesus says look at here
[1:25:48] and Satan turns the page and he says
[1:25:50] look at here and Jesus said look at him
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:25:59] a man walked up to me in the in a
[1:26:01] funeral one time at the at the at the
[1:26:04] gravesite and he was standing there and
[1:26:06] he said I heard you preached something
[1:26:07] wrong this morning Preacher
[1:26:09] he said you know the almighty God can't
[1:26:12] find your sins
[1:26:15] he said he's God
[1:26:17] he can remember everything
[1:26:20] I said huh
[1:26:22] I said do you want a God Like That
[1:26:25] does your God remember all of your old
[1:26:27] nonsense

[1:26:34] woman that you've got standing beside of
[1:26:35] you you're living with her
[1:26:40] and I said you've been divorced twice
[1:26:43] yeah I said you better pray for a God

[1:26:50] and here you're telling me that I'm
[1:26:52] wrong you better pray that you meet the
[1:26:54] God that I have
[1:26:56] that can take away your sins that you're
[1:26:59] not guilty of your history
[1:27:11] I don't want to know your history
[1:27:15] I don't need a five-hour conference with
[1:27:18] you to you to tell me all the nonsense
[1:27:19] in your life and to take me through Tin
[1:27:22] Can Alley all I want you to do is meet
[1:27:24] Jesus Christ and I'm talking about
[1:27:26] meaning and dying out of your old nature
[1:27:29] and getting filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:31] and get Washed by the Water of the word
[1:27:34] and get a change in a Sanctified and
[1:27:37] filled in Holy Ghost life

[1:27:41] identification that I'm not that man or
[1:27:45] woman anymore I I've been changed

[1:28:53] audience or in the Unseen audience
[1:29:00] won't you just let him come in your life
[1:29:04] I'm not talking about a picture on the
[1:29:06] wall
[1:29:07] I'm not talking about a storybook
[1:29:09] historical Jesus Christ
[1:29:16] our Prophet would have been a murderer
[1:29:19] if God would have permitted it
[1:29:23] a man that could shoot holes with his
[1:29:25] shot with his gun
[1:29:27] literally one shot after another shot
[1:29:30] God would have committed he'd he'll kill
[1:29:32] six boys
[1:29:34] he'd have killed him
[1:29:39] standing preaching and the angel tells
[1:29:42] him he'll have a trial tonight
[1:29:45] and a man is making love to a
[1:29:47] girl
[1:29:48] and the angel said do with them what you
[1:29:51] will
[1:29:54] brother random could have spoke him out
[1:29:55] of existence
[1:29:57] but he said I forgive you
[1:30:01] he's in a little home
[1:30:03] he's telling a story about squirrels
[1:30:09] and a woman
[1:30:12] sitting across the room
[1:30:14] said that's absolutely the truth brother
[1:30:16] Branham
[1:30:20] brother Chris right there raise your
[1:30:22] hand brother Chris
[1:30:23] has the table
[1:30:26] or brother Branham ate those squirrels
[1:30:29] at
[1:30:31] he's actually got the table in his
[1:30:32] office
[1:30:33] came from Charlie Cox
[1:30:37] this ain't some makeshift
[1:30:39] you can't just make this stuff up
[1:30:43] but from that table brother Ram goes
[1:30:45] back home and tells that woman
[1:30:48] that's literally living with her mother
[1:30:50] and father and has a sister who is an
[1:30:53] invalid whom brother Branham said I
[1:30:55] prayed more prayers for than any other
[1:30:57] person
[1:31:02] and when she responded that's absolutely
[1:31:04] the truth
[1:31:06] she stepped into the rim of the third
[1:31:07] pull
[1:31:11] she stepped into a realm of the third
[1:31:13] pull remember the woman in Memphis she
[1:31:15] spoke a storm into existence that
[1:31:17] brother Brandon would be there for her
[1:31:19] son dying
[1:31:20] brother Graham said she used the same
[1:31:23] power that Jesus spoke that storm out of
[1:31:26] existence
[1:31:29] I got a point I want to drive here
[1:31:31] and had he stepped into a realm and he
[1:31:34] said whatever you desire whatever you
[1:31:36] can have it she said what do I ask for
[1:31:37] you can have all the money
[1:31:40] you're poor you're gonna have all the
[1:31:42] money
[1:31:43] you can have different things he
[1:31:45] presented to her and she spoke something
[1:31:49] into existence that was greater than all
[1:31:51] the third pull put together
[1:31:56] greater than a storm greater than
[1:31:58] brother branham's wife tumor going away
[1:32:00] right before the doctor in a surgery
[1:32:03] and she spoke spoken word
[1:32:07] Eternity for her two boys
[1:32:10] [Applause]
[1:32:12] what about your children
[1:32:17] what about your children
[1:32:21] what about your children you heard it
[1:32:23] last night more than the voice of Andrew
[1:32:25] more than the voice of your pastor
[1:32:30] what about your situation
[1:32:33] written in the new book the acts of God
[1:32:36] on the inside of you
[1:32:40] Billy Andrew said if there's only two
[1:32:41] boys in heaven those two's going to be
[1:32:43] there
[1:32:48] what about your children on the internet
[1:32:51] what about your children
[1:32:54] Adam and Eve could have had spoken word
[1:32:56] Sons
[1:32:58] but they stepped into the realm of sin
[1:33:01] and they came by
[1:33:03] the Fallen nature which put you under
[1:33:05] the first book
[1:33:07] but what about the second book when we
[1:33:09] speak
[1:33:10] eternal life
[1:33:11] it's what we're doing here this morning
[1:33:13] we're speaking to sinful flesh and
[1:33:16] telling you you don't have to stay that
[1:33:17] way no more
[1:33:21] you can have Jesus
[1:33:23] the same Jesus that lived in the prophet
[1:33:27] but the random couldn't die for himself
[1:33:30] but he could die to himself
[1:33:33] brother on I'm still struggling with
[1:33:35] things in my life
[1:33:37] just give it to God
[1:33:44] pray just now
[1:33:47] Lord Jesus
[1:33:55] no doubt there's 90 percent Christians
[1:33:58] real Christians dedicated here
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:03] to steal the humanity Razzles
[1:34:07] Spirit wrestles because Satan can work
[1:34:10] on two realms
[1:34:12] you can work on flesh and he could work
[1:34:14] on spirit
[1:34:15] [Music]
[1:34:17] down on the inside or Satan can't get to
[1:34:21] a place about the size of a button
[1:34:25] eternal life lives there
[1:34:27] and it controls our flesh and our spirit
[1:34:31] and maybe there's a Warfare going on
[1:34:34] right now
[1:34:38] Maybe by an uplifted hand
[1:34:40] they could say brother Ron
