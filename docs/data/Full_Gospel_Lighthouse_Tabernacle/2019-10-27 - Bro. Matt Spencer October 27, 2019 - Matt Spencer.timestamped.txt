[4:15] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[4:19] God amen I want to be an overcomer and
[4:23] eat of that tree of life amen and first
[4:26] John one and one concerned there says in
[4:29] the beginning was the word and the Word
[4:32] was with God and the Word was God
[4:35] the same was in the beginning with God
[4:38] all things were made by him and without
[4:41] him was not anything made that was made
[4:45] in him was life and the life was the
[4:50] light of men and the light technology I
[4:59] just jumped all the way down to the
[5:01] bottom amen and the life was the light
[5:05] of men
[5:06] and the light shine ahthe in darkness
[5:09] and the darkness comprehended it not
[5:12] amen you can be seated tonight that's
[5:16] the blessings on the reading of the word
[5:18] and the darkness comprehended it not
[5:24] amen where there is God's light there is
[5:30] life amen
[5:32] I like walking in the light of the war
[5:40] amen
[5:41] struggle in here
[5:48] a man so we know that God in His light
[5:53] there is life and there's growth in that
[5:57] life you know there's growth in the SU n
[6:02] but there's also growth in the SOE n you
[6:07] know I was thinking on what happens when
[6:10] there's a lack of Sun s UN in nature in
[6:16] darkness we take the the deepest in the
[6:20] sea deep dark in the sea and and in that
[6:24] sea there's there's creatures that can
[6:27] only live in that darkness and because
[6:32] of that darkness they're deformed
[6:34] creatures you know and then even even
[6:40] outside in the natural when there's
[6:42] darkness lack of Sun let's take Alaska
[6:47] in in borrow Alaska I've heard there's
[6:52] sixty seven days of darkness from about
[6:55] November the 18th told January the 23rd
[6:59] darkness sets in and you know it's kind
[7:03] of like it is now it's it's starting to
[7:05] get darker earlier and earlier in the
[7:07] year and and I think it's next weekend
[7:09] we we change our our clocks you know so
[7:12] it's gonna get darker early early in the
[7:14] evening and so less time to to hunt I
[7:17] mean work and amen
[7:23] but but when there's darkness of days
[7:27] for a very long time darkness there
[7:32] causes confusion in that area there is a
[7:37] thing called seasonal affective disorder
[7:40] which is a type of a depression in that
[7:44] area because of how dark it is for such
[7:47] a length of time and lack of that
[7:50] sunlight is debilitating and even
[7:54] promotes thoughts of suicide and many
[7:59] times it said that
[8:01] that people don't commit suicide
[8:04] throughout that period of time until
[8:07] they realize that spring is beginning to
[8:10] come and they're not prepared for it and
[8:13] light is starting to creep in but that's
[8:19] when they're starting to commit suicide
[8:21] now I just I just pondered that that why
[8:24] now why is that the pressures of the
[8:29] light upon them and they cannot handle
[8:33] that light says in Luke 21 29 said
[8:38] behold the fig tree and all the trees
[8:42] when they now shoot forth you see you
[8:47] know that your son you know your own
[8:49] selves that summer is now at hand and so
[8:54] likewise you when you see the things
[8:58] come to pass and know that the kingdom
[9:00] of God is now not hand says verily I say
[9:04] unto you this generation shall not pass
[9:06] away till all be fulfilled till that
[9:10] last seed comes in and it says in heaven
[9:14] and earth shall pass away but my words
[9:17] shall not pass away we're living in the
[9:22] last days we're having living in the
[9:25] Laodicean age as brother Andrew was
[9:27] saying last night we're in that age but
[9:30] we're not of that age amen darkness is
[9:33] all around we're in the harvest time the
[9:39] time of the year of fall when when you
[9:42] see the great combines and the fields
[9:44] and they're starting to gather the crops
[9:46] of the fields and and even the trees are
[9:50] starting to bring forth a lot more fruit
[9:53] and you know this time of year in nature
[9:59] there's a thing called leaf peeping
[10:02] season that is a thing where people will
[10:05] travel throughout the east east coast up
[10:09] and down towards New England and and
[10:11] they will begin to watch
[10:14] trees change and the leaves Lisa those
[10:18] trees beginning to change and they will
[10:22] look up on that and they will spend
[10:24] thousands of dollars and and hours take
[10:27] off from work and they will begin this
[10:30] journey to look at all this nature and
[10:33] what God has created and and just the
[10:38] paintbrush that he just uses and and how
[10:40] he can make this tree that was so green
[10:43] and vibrant in the spring
[10:45] now it's budding for not budding forth
[10:48] but has red leaves and the dark of the
[10:52] bark is darker and it's just amazing to
[10:56] what God can do through that and there's
[11:00] so many people that are looking at these
[11:02] things they'll take pictures and and
[11:04] they'll have a memory of what they seen
[11:07] and and they will they worship more of
[11:11] the creation more than they do the
[11:15] create or a man that no I love I love
[11:19] trees I love the wilderness I love I
[11:21] love this time of year and just like
[11:25] anyone else that the changing of how
[11:26] beautiful it is and and you know that we
[11:31] have many different types of trees there
[11:33] oak trees and you know there's a lot of
[11:38] maple trees and just the beauty of those
[11:41] maple trees and you know they're
[11:46] bringing forth their fruits and and
[11:49] their leaves are beautiful but there's
[11:53] things that's going on inside of those
[11:55] with those woods there's there's
[11:58] branches that are are dead there's trees
[12:01] that are dead with inside those woods
[12:03] and and in a couple more weeks all the
[12:07] leaves will be off the trees and and
[12:09] it's hard to tell whether that tree has
[12:12] life or whether that tree is hollow and
[12:15] dead
[12:17] and and so you won't know that until
[12:20] spring buds for fugget and so we look at
[12:26] that and and then this time of year you
[12:28] can start to see more widow-makers
[12:31] it how many knows what a Widowmaker is a
[12:34] Widowmaker is a branch that has fallen
[12:38] off of a big tree and is hanging on
[12:42] smaller trees or just barely hanging on
[12:46] to the tree itself and if someone would
[12:50] walk underneath of it and it would the
[12:51] wind would blow just right and and fall
[12:54] down upon a man that's why they call
[12:56] them widow-makers well what that
[12:58] Widowmaker is doing is and when it's
[13:01] when it's on top of these little Wordle
[13:03] trees it's starting to go way down that
[13:06] trees growth and and even inside of that
[13:10] tree there's rings inside of that tree
[13:13] that that tells its its story of life
[13:16] and if you would take that tree later
[13:20] down the road and you would cut that
[13:21] tree down you could see that at one
[13:25] point there was distress on this tree
[13:29] and you see many things like a knot on
[13:31] the on a tree and and you wonder hat now
[13:34] what made that come out of that you know
[13:37] meant men will take spikes and drive
[13:40] them into a tree for for maybe a marking
[13:42] post or something and and before long
[13:45] that tree will will overtake and grow
[13:47] around that and many many trees have
[13:51] been markers in life for navigation for
[13:55] for roadways and how people need to get
[13:58] around and you take over here on poor
[14:00] Republic Road are not poor public but
[14:02] over to Weir's cave there's a tree
[14:04] called the Stonewall Jackson tree that
[14:06] used to be there and that used to be the
[14:08] Stonewall Jackson prayer tree and people
[14:11] would come from all around to look at
[14:13] this tree in all of its glory and and
[14:16] they would take the limbs that would
[14:18] fall off of that tree and they would
[14:20] make pencils out of that isn't that
[14:23] correct brother Justin amen and they
[14:27] would you know sell them at these like
[14:29] this this come out of the stone
[14:30] Jaxson prayer tree so many times trees
[14:33] have have represented things in life
[14:37] boundaries markers roadways and and we
[14:41] see their strong trees that's giving
[14:45] life even out to the wilderness the
[14:48] birds of the air and you know that
[14:51] they're spiders and stuff that that will
[14:53] attach to trees back and forth and and
[14:56] so you know the other day me and Andrew
[15:00] was walking through the woods and and
[15:03] you know right about August time it
[15:05] seems like every spider makes huge webs
[15:08] and if you've ever walked through the
[15:11] woods you know what I'm about to say
[15:12] when you're walking through you're
[15:14] walking like this because you do not
[15:18] want that spider web on your face and
[15:21] then trying to find out where that
[15:22] spider has went to and so me and Andrew
[15:25] was walking through the woods the other
[15:26] day and was actually going to a hunting
[15:28] spot and and I had a rake in my hand and
[15:30] he was just walking on through there and
[15:32] he was fighting the spider webs and I
[15:34] had the rake and I was just walking and
[15:36] with him like it you know they ain't
[15:38] ain't no spider was getting on me and
[15:39] and he turns around looks and he give me
[15:43] that well I guess I better follow him
[15:50] now because now now he's got it so so
[15:53] what I did was he started creating a
[15:56] clear path for me to follow you know so
[16:00] so many times in life will be walking
[16:03] through the the natural woods so to say
[16:06] and there'll be spider web getting all
[16:08] over us more but if you have somebody in
[16:11] front of you leading the way creating a
[16:15] clear path you don't have to worry about
[16:18] all that and I thought about that how
[16:21] that I follow him in natural sense but I
[16:24] also follow him in a spiritual sense
[16:27] amen
[16:28] and so this this is a thing where where
[16:34] life is produced and and so I want to
[16:37] kind of take that tonight how that the
[16:39] trees and and the tree of life and the
[16:42] tree of knowledge
[16:44] two trees brother branham says that
[16:47] there was a in restoration of the bride
[16:49] tree two trees the restoration of the
[16:55] bride tree but also the bridegroom tree
[16:58] amen and that's what we're trying to get
[17:01] back to is him amen and as it said we we
[17:07] would eat off of the Tree of Life
[17:09] to him that overcometh and so that's
[17:12] what I want to to be as an overcomer
[17:16] amen and as I was saying that people in
[17:19] this day and age that they they worship
[17:21] more the creation more than they do the
[17:25] create or so if we can turn to Romans 1
[17:29] verse 21 I'd like to read here where it
[17:34] describes how people's minds begin to
[17:39] turn over once they worship more of
[17:40] their creation and verse 21 Romans 1:21
[17:47] says because that when they knew God
[17:50] they glorified him not as God neither
[17:53] we're thankful but became vain in their
[17:56] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[18:00] darkened professing themselves to be
[18:03] wise became they became fools and they
[18:07] changed the glory of the uncorruptible
[18:10] God into an image made of corruptible
[18:15] man and the birds and the four-footed
[18:18] beast and the creeping things wherefore
[18:21] God also gave them up to uncleanness he
[18:25] went ahead and just gave them up to what
[18:27] they was wanting to get to said unclean
[18:30] things through the lust of their own
[18:32] hearts desire their own bodies between
[18:37] themselves who changed the truth of God
[18:41] into a lie and worshipped and served the
[18:44] create the creature more than they did
[18:47] the Creator who is blessed forever why
[18:52] would you want to worship something
[18:53] other than the create or that is blessed
[18:56] forever
[18:57] for this God called them gave them up
[19:01] unto vile affections for unto the women
[19:05] their women did change the natural use
[19:08] into which is against the natural nature
[19:11] and likewise also men leaving natural
[19:15] use of the woman burned in their lust
[19:17] one toward another men with men working
[19:21] that which was unseemly and receiving in
[19:25] themselves that recompence of their
[19:28] error which was met that was fitting for
[19:32] them and even as they did not like to
[19:38] return retain God in their knowledge God
[19:42] gave them over to a reprobate mind to do
[19:46] those things which are not convenient
[19:49] being filled with unrighteousness
[19:52] fornication wickedness covetousness
[19:55] maliciousness full of envy murder debate
[19:59] deceit malignity whisperers backbiters
[20:04] haters of god despiteful proud boasters
[20:08] inventors of evil things disobedient to
[20:13] their parents without understanding
[20:16] covet breakers without natural affection
[20:19] implacable unmerciful knowing who
[20:26] knowing now they knew the judgment of
[20:30] God that they which commit such things
[20:33] are worthy of death they knew this not
[20:38] only do they do the same but they have
[20:41] pleasures in them that do it I don't
[20:45] know about you but I believe I just read
[20:47] what we was that we're living in what a
[20:51] dark age that we're living in brother
[20:56] Branham describes it as just a little
[20:58] bit of light there God is that light
[21:03] it says in Genesis 1 and 3 says God said
[21:07] let there be light and there was light
[21:10] and God saw the light and it was good
[21:12] and God divided the light from the
[21:15] darkness and God called the light day
[21:17] and the darkness he called night and the
[21:20] evening and the morning were the first
[21:22] day now what happened here there was a
[21:25] separation God had light and he
[21:29] separated the light from the darkness
[21:32] brother Branham says here is there's a
[21:36] man that can turn on the light says in
[21:39] the fourth verse he separated the light
[21:41] from the darkness and the light he
[21:43] called day in the darkness he called
[21:44] night and God's Word always separates a
[21:48] light from darkness it's the word that
[21:52] does the separating I like that it's
[21:54] that word that does that separating the
[21:57] light from the darkness and God ever
[22:01] does the same thing when he gets ready
[22:03] to use anything like he got ready to use
[22:06] that old star or whatever it was this
[22:09] world he had to separate the light from
[22:11] the darkness when he gets ready to leave
[22:15] to use a group of people he has to
[22:19] separate the light from the darkness I'm
[22:22] that group of people I'm planning on
[22:24] leaving here he's gonna separate this
[22:27] light from that darkness hey man and
[22:30] when he gets ready to use an individual
[22:32] he separates that light from that
[22:35] darkness see that light comes by God and
[22:38] remember the light come by his spoken
[22:41] word and the Word of God said let there
[22:45] be light and when there was no light at
[22:47] all and he sent the light and separated
[22:51] the darkness from the light God's doing
[22:54] some separating in this time sometimes
[22:58] we think how in the world did we get
[22:59] here well he's starting to do some
[23:01] separating here we didn't know it's not
[23:05] anything within us that brought us here
[23:07] it's like brother Andrew was saying last
[23:08] night no but he'd never called nobody up
[23:10] and said get here
[23:12] the Lord is drawing us that light
[23:16] drawing us amen for God is light and
[23:23] first John one and five says God is
[23:26] light and in him is no darkness at all
[23:28] Amen you take a light and you shine it
[23:32] in darkness you look at this light all
[23:36] around it may be darkness all the way
[23:39] around there but there is no darkness at
[23:43] all inside of that light you cannot find
[23:46] no darkness in that light God is that
[23:50] light in him is no darkness and if we
[23:55] say we have fellowship with him but walk
[23:58] in darkness we lie and do not the truth
[24:01] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[24:04] the light and have fellowship one with
[24:06] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:09] His Son cleanses us from all our sins
[24:12] and if we say that we have no sin we
[24:16] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[24:18] in us see there's still darkness inside
[24:21] of there if we're doing that in him is
[24:28] life and the life was the light of men
[24:33] we're growing something's drawing us
[24:36] those trees what did they do they
[24:39] stretch forth towards the Sun they now
[24:43] you can take a tree and as a little
[24:46] sapling you can take that little sapling
[24:48] and you can put little little ropes on
[24:50] it and you can try to pull it this way
[24:52] and say now tree you're going to grow
[24:54] this way because I want you to shade my
[24:56] house that is over here and so I'm gonna
[24:58] pull you this way and so you take ropes
[25:01] and you'll start fasten it down and you
[25:03] drive stakes in the ground and you say
[25:05] well this is the way I want this tree to
[25:06] lean because it has a good look to it
[25:08] and it might be one of those Asian trees
[25:11] where he has like twists and turns all
[25:13] the way around and so you keep keep
[25:15] pulling it pulling but what happens that
[25:18] tree will still branch forth towards the
[25:22] son and it still starts to grow and says
[25:26] this is where I'm receiving my life my
[25:30] life is over here you want to take me
[25:32] there but my life is here right here is
[25:35] my lifeline why do you want to draw me
[25:37] there that's the same thing that the
[25:39] devil will do you'll try to pull you
[25:41] over here with its ropes and its dogmas
[25:43] and his denominations and say this is
[25:45] what I want you to believe but you say
[25:47] no this is life ah ha ha what life so
[26:03] the devil will do those kind of things
[26:04] to to stop you and if he can't put a
[26:09] hold onto you a rope on you he'll send
[26:12] in bugs little insects in Joel what
[26:18] talks about the Palma worm the
[26:20] cankerworm the locust and the
[26:23] caterpillar and what do these things do
[26:29] the pommel worm the pommel war begins to
[26:33] take off the fruits brother branham
[26:36] describes it as this the fruits of the
[26:38] vine love joy peace longsuffering God
[26:43] God knit goodness meekness faith
[26:46] patience and the Holy Ghost that pommel
[26:50] worm will will come in that that little
[26:52] insect will start to eat the fruits off
[26:54] of off of that tree but it has four
[26:59] stages that pommel worm will eat that
[27:04] brotherly love it'll come in and say now
[27:09] there's something wrong so and so's
[27:10] saying something about you over here and
[27:13] that'll start to begin separation you
[27:18] know it'll create a lack of faith in the
[27:21] word
[27:23] it'll take the joy of your salvation
[27:24] that pummel worm it will eat those
[27:28] fruits just as we had the service the
[27:31] other night where each of us had went
[27:32] into our home and say and I'm gonna let
[27:34] Joey in the devil don't like that the
[27:40] devil likes to send in little bugs that
[27:42] like to just just nibble away and eat
[27:46] away just a little little by little so
[27:48] it'll take the joy of your salvation
[27:50] it'll take your peace of mind knowing
[27:53] that you're saved it'll do all these
[27:57] little things creating a way for the
[28:00] next cycle what's the next cycle is the
[28:04] locusts the locusts that comes in it
[28:07] eats the leaves many times you'll see in
[28:11] the spring there be a tree that got on
[28:15] this thing it was a vibrant tree there
[28:17] for a little while well this locust
[28:20] began to eat the leaves thereof what is
[28:24] those leaves they those leaves those are
[28:29] divine fellowship brother branham
[28:32] describes it like this is underneath the
[28:34] cool of the trees like in the comfort of
[28:37] your home's in the comfort of the word
[28:40] those locusts will start eating away at
[28:43] each little leaf taken away all that and
[28:49] then it makes a way for the cankerworm
[28:52] now what does the cankerworm do the
[28:56] cankerworm now goes into the bark makes
[28:59] his way into the bark and starts to
[29:03] destroy the covering off of the tree the
[29:06] protection that has around it now last
[29:10] year I cut down a lot of trees with the
[29:13] year before last and and so I piled up a
[29:17] lot of a lot of wood for firewood and
[29:19] and the other day I begin to split some
[29:22] wood and you know on the outside of a
[29:25] lot of those logs they look perfect
[29:27] ready to be split and so I take that
[29:30] splitter and I'd run them down through
[29:32] there and they start to split open well
[29:34] that bark would start to peel away
[29:36] but on the inside of that bark there's
[29:39] this huge black beetle and I thought
[29:43] well how in the world did he get there
[29:45] because that bark looked just fine right
[29:48] out here but what happened was when that
[29:51] tree was vibrant full of life there was
[29:54] a little bug a cankerworm that had made
[29:58] its way inside of there and so what it's
[30:02] done then it's allowed all those other
[30:05] bugs to eat around it too and so when
[30:08] you start to peel away all that bark you
[30:11] pretty much got a little log that's
[30:12] about like this and you did all that
[30:16] work to get it to this point and so that
[30:20] cankerworm will eat away at that
[30:23] protection of it it's tried eating away
[30:27] at the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[30:31] blood as the covering that's what the
[30:34] devil will do he'll send out these
[30:38] insects to eat away at you little by
[30:40] little and what's the next stage is a
[30:44] caterpillar but the random describes the
[30:47] caterpillar as a sucker it will suck the
[30:50] life out of the tree it'll start to de
[30:56] nominate what was undeneath
[31:04] this is the way you need to do run your
[31:06] churches this is where you need to run
[31:08] your service
[31:08] now you can't preach this but we're
[31:10] going to allow you to preach this over
[31:12] here because this over here kind of
[31:14] hurts stings a little bit you know but
[31:19] that's the way the caterpillar will do
[31:21] to take out that life you can see that
[31:25] we've had life in this church over the
[31:28] past year you can see that whole egos
[31:30] fire that's been filling our young
[31:32] people amen that life has not been taken
[31:37] out of this amen but each insect has
[31:42] made a way for each other amen
[31:48] brother Branham says it like this in the
[31:51] Ephesians church age says when the Sun
[31:55] the SU n begins to shine down through
[31:58] the fog and the midst of the night no
[32:01] matter where that seed is it'll live
[32:05] amen so in the forests of the trees in
[32:10] the springtime you'll see all these
[32:13] these little saplings that's raising up
[32:15] and you and you come and you look at
[32:19] them all and they're all vibrant and
[32:21] then comes fall and and all the leaves
[32:25] has gone off of it and you can't pick
[32:27] out which one's going to make it through
[32:28] and which ones not and it's like I was
[32:32] saying about that that Widowmaker it's
[32:35] taken away the sunlight from a lot of
[32:38] these little saplings down here that are
[32:41] going to grow up and the sun's not able
[32:44] to shine down on those those seeds that
[32:46] are down inside of there that is
[32:48] producing a life and so what happens
[32:51] when you don't have Sun as you in things
[32:55] will dwarf things will become not as
[32:59] vibrant in life and so what happens is
[33:03] is that that Sun that's supposed to
[33:06] shine down on there and that and that
[33:08] little Widowmaker that's there it's just
[33:11] taking up space in the trees there's
[33:13] nothing good about a Widowmaker
[33:15] nothing you I hope you're not a
[33:18] Widowmaker here tonight taking away time
[33:20] and space away from little ones or
[33:23] people that's getting the Holy Ghost and
[33:25] and saying now this that that was in the
[33:27] days of past that's not now don't be a
[33:30] Widowmaker of today amen don't take away
[33:33] the Sun from someone that's trying to
[33:35] grow in the goodness of life amen
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:44] and so what happens is that son it's
[33:49] starting to bring forth those seeds and
[33:52] so this time of year those leaves are
[33:56] falling off and those acorns underneath
[33:58] there are starting to be covered up by
[34:02] leaves that are falling off and you
[34:04] wonder well I wonder which one is going
[34:07] to receive life here I wonder what
[34:09] sapling is going to make it up through
[34:11] well brother branham describes it as
[34:13] this and says it's because all botany
[34:17] life lives by the Sun and we know that
[34:21] and you could pour concrete right across
[34:24] a piece of grass the next spring where
[34:28] is the thickest grass right out at the
[34:31] end of that concrete why that's life
[34:34] beneath there that seed is underneath
[34:38] there but you can't hide real life that
[34:43] little life as soon as it knows that the
[34:46] sun's bathing through there it's warming
[34:49] up inside of there and it'll warm its
[34:52] way out a half a city block almost
[34:54] getting around underneath that concrete
[34:57] till it sticks hits him a little head up
[35:00] right up there in the air and starts to
[35:02] begin to praise God you can't hide life
[35:05] that's right
[35:07] life when you're born again you can't
[35:10] hide it something's got to cry out amen
[35:13] when that Suns beginning to pour down on
[35:16] those leaves and there's little acorns
[35:19] underneath there they're starting to
[35:20] feel the vibrant nests of that Sun and
[35:22] it's starting to draw forth and
[35:23] something's pulling it up and it's
[35:25] beginning to live Zechariah says it in
[35:31] 14 and 16 says it shall come to pass in
[35:36] that day that the light shall not be
[35:39] clearer nor dark kind of foggy can't
[35:43] really see that great but it shall be
[35:46] one day we shall be known to the Lord
[35:51] not day nor night
[35:54] it shall come to pass that in the
[35:56] evening light in the evening time it
[36:01] shall be light that's what I like in the
[36:05] evening time it shall be light now the
[36:07] same sun's but there's random describes
[36:10] it like this the same Sun that comes
[36:12] across from the west coast that's
[36:14] shining towards the East Coast it's the
[36:16] same Sun there as it is here the same
[36:19] Sun that it was in the other church ages
[36:22] is the same Sun coming forth in the
[36:24] Laodicean age and it's receiving its
[36:27] light and we're starting to grow from
[36:29] that light I'm like drawing to a light
[36:31] and God sees that light laying down on
[36:34] the inside of you that little life and
[36:36] says you're gonna make it as the evening
[36:39] times coming forth that light shine at
[36:41] for fences you're gonna make it starts
[36:45] to begin to paw and says you're
[36:46] predestinated seed there's a seed that
[36:49] was down on the inside of you that when
[36:52] that sum overshadowed it started to
[36:55] bring for flies now that same sapling
[36:57] that's in the woods next year and you
[37:00] see that one that it's growing up taller
[37:02] than all the other ones what's inside of
[37:04] that one same Sun same plant but there
[37:09] was predestinated life inside of that
[37:11] sapling that says you're gonna make it
[37:14] and how does nature say don't eat upon
[37:18] this tree the deers will pass in and
[37:21] won't eat upon that one but this one
[37:23] begins to grow how did you get here how
[37:28] you know I just think how did we all get
[37:31] here you know you can link people back
[37:34] to maybe there was a grandmother that
[37:37] got baptized underneath Homer granddaddy
[37:39] Homer our brother Homer I should say and
[37:43] that grandma she was a light to that
[37:48] that home when maybe there was people
[37:51] inside of that home that maybe thought
[37:55] I'll never be a Christian like add I'll
[37:58] never do something like that
[38:00] I think of brother Wayne brother Wayne
[38:02] on his 80th birthday hear how that he
[38:06] would send his
[38:07] eyes through his mama and finally
[38:11] brother brother grant Homer said no you
[38:15] bring your ties yourself you come on
[38:17] here what happened
[38:20] granddaddy see that there was a seed on
[38:22] the inside of there and God said I'm
[38:26] gonna shine my light over here on him
[38:28] that seeds gotta come forth and what's
[38:31] happened from that more light has lifted
[38:34] into this family has raised up more
[38:37] lights you will be alight to people that
[38:41] I will never be light to in this dark
[38:44] age there were people that will see you
[38:47] and see that light that you're shining
[38:49] out with you and they'll go what's
[38:53] what's different about this person
[38:55] what's different about them
[38:57] that's like brother Andrew and dad them
[38:59] and they took their trip down to
[39:00] Louisiana at the camp meetings down
[39:03] there they was driving back in and
[39:05] they'd stopped at a gas station and
[39:08] there was a black man and woman that
[39:10] that pulled there and started talking to
[39:13] him said where were y'all hiddenness
[39:15] well we've just come from a camp meeting
[39:17] here in Louisiana we spoke that and now
[39:21] we're heading back home with our
[39:22] families and and some of you was even
[39:24] there and they begin to talk to him and
[39:28] the the man was a prison minister said
[39:32] correct he was a prison minister and his
[39:35] wife and they did mission work between
[39:37] the prisons and and and dad asked us by
[39:40] the way how'd you know he said the light
[39:44] man the light see you're shining the
[39:48] light and people seen in that light and
[39:51] they don't know what's different but
[39:53] they know there's something different a
[39:55] man
[39:56] [Applause]
[40:07] we're representing Christ that's God's
[40:11] life living in us a light light shining
[40:15] forth in this world amen you know I just
[40:28] think it's amazing how I was saying
[40:31] about how that some of us have made it
[40:33] here to the spots that we are now and
[40:36] but God knew us before the foundation of
[40:40] the world when he was saying let there
[40:44] be light he was speaking of me was he
[40:49] speaking of you when he said let there
[40:52] be light let me separate that darkness
[40:54] from the light and we go draw
[41:01] nourishment from that light don't we'll
[41:05] gather here Saturdays and Sundays and
[41:07] some of our young people will have choir
[41:10] meetings and they'll start to draw a
[41:12] light from each other
[41:14] amen we draw light and we grow from that
[41:18] light that seed that's down on the
[41:21] inside of us David said it like this in
[41:25] Psalms 1 and 3 says and he shall be like
[41:28] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[41:31] and bringing forth his fruit in his
[41:35] season his leaf also shall not wither
[41:38] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[41:43] well the Branham says it like this and
[41:45] registered restoration of the Brahe tree
[41:49] said David saw it and he spoken blessed
[41:52] is that man notice he couldn't he could
[41:57] not die his leaves would not wither no
[42:01] matter what they do they'll never kill
[42:04] that tree that tree that's planet
[42:07] where's its planet its planet by the
[42:10] rivers of water
[42:11] now notice David says his roots will not
[42:16] die
[42:17] brother branham says it like this and
[42:19] says you know you take a tree a big old
[42:21] tree says when I was a boy I used to go
[42:24] out and reduce us boys we'd go out and
[42:27] there's a big old tree that we used to
[42:30] set under a big old beech tree and the
[42:33] winds would blow and I wondered and I'd
[42:36] look at that thing and over and over
[42:39] again and that that when time after time
[42:42] would blow the tree and it would rock
[42:44] that tree but what's it doing it's
[42:49] loosening up the roots so that they can
[42:52] just dig a little deeper and get a
[42:55] better hole he says it like this and
[42:58] says that's the way mockery laughing
[43:02] making fun of a Christian what it does
[43:05] the persecution shakes the Christian
[43:09] make him want to pray more dig down a
[43:12] little deeper get a better hold so he
[43:15] could stay in that storm
[43:22] hallelujah to win the storms of life
[43:27] it's gonna take a stronger win than this
[43:31] to keep me from my promises that
[43:34] stronger wind that takes and blows and
[43:36] huh you just say not now Satan I'm
[43:39] digging down deeper oh give me a little
[43:41] more that acts 2:38 that'll what the
[43:44] devil it continues to just dig into what
[43:48] it's gets a better hold that Beatle
[43:53] can't destroy that beetle that I was
[43:55] talking about it will never destroy that
[43:58] tree that has true life says in first
[44:05] John 1 and ain't and if we say we have
[44:09] no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[44:12] truth is not in us if we confess our
[44:16] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[44:19] us of our sins and cleanse us from all
[44:22] our unrighteousness so what happens when
[44:26] you have that little that little bug and
[44:29] you you saying listen I'm ready I just
[44:31] want to surrender to him I'm done I'm
[44:34] gonna give it all to him God sends that
[44:37] whole it goes that fire down on the
[44:39] inside of you
[44:41] cleanses you that pesticide that'll get
[44:44] rid of you written I get rid of you get
[44:47] rid of that insect that's on the inside
[44:48] of you it'll get rid of that old nature
[44:52] and says and we have the need of
[44:56] forgiveness of our sins the blood of
[44:59] Christ
[44:59] is the divine provision for both we see
[45:04] in John 1 2 and 1 it says my little
[45:07] children these things I write unto you
[45:10] that if you sin that you sin not
[45:14] and if any man sin we have an advocate
[45:18] with the father Jesus Christ the
[45:21] righteousness and he he is the
[45:25] propitiation for our sins and not only
[45:28] for ours only but also for the sins of
[45:32] the whole world
[45:33] the whole world he has taken it all upon
[45:36] himself he has shined that light in this
[45:40] dark age you know what we'll get rid of
[45:44] a beetle and a bug you see these trees
[45:48] on the side of these mountains that over
[45:50] in West Virginia there's a spot across
[45:52] 64 that where that there's been beetles
[45:55] has eat up the whole forest on the side
[45:58] of this mountain and you can see it for
[46:01] miles
[46:02] there's no life no life in those trees
[46:06] what'll here that I tell you what'll
[46:09] cure that that's a fire fire fire will
[46:14] take care of all those beetles it'll
[46:17] wipe away all all those sins of beetles
[46:21] it'll kill it all and what happens new
[46:25] growth begins to come after a fire hey
[46:29] man what happens out of the ashes comes
[46:31] beauty oh how that that beautiful little
[46:35] pond Lily was down on the inside of that
[46:37] pond and that sign that sunshine down
[46:39] through there and it began to bud forth
[46:41] and that beauty just come forth what
[46:44] happens when that fire goes across those
[46:46] woods and we'll burn it all off it
[46:49] creates new life that life that'll shine
[46:52] that life that shines in darkness aren't
[46:57] you glad of that tonight amen
[47:03] aren't you glad God knows where you are
[47:05] in every situation I'm glad of that in
[47:13] John 1 and 43 says the day of following
[47:21] Jesus would go forth into Galilee and
[47:26] findeth Philip and said unto Him follow
[47:30] me now Philip was of Bethesda the city
[47:35] Andrew of Andrew and Peter and Philip
[47:38] findeth Nathanael and saith unto him we
[47:43] have found him now Philip is talking to
[47:48] who Moses in the law and the prophets
[47:51] did write about Jesus of Nazareth the
[47:55] son of Joseph and Nathanael said unto
[47:58] Him can there any good come out of
[48:02] Nazareth and Philip saith unto Him we'll
[48:05] come and see and Jesus saw Nathanael
[48:08] coming up to him and he saith unto Him
[48:12] behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no
[48:16] guile and Nathanael said unto Him whence
[48:22] knowest thou me Jesus answer is sent
[48:25] unto Him before that Philip called thee
[48:28] when thou wast underneath the fig tree I
[48:31] saw you and the thing who answered and
[48:35] said unto Him rabbi thou art the Son of
[48:39] God thou art the king of Israel and
[48:42] jesus answered and said unto him because
[48:46] I said unto thee that I saw you under
[48:48] the fig tree believe us now thou shalt
[48:52] have greater things than these and said
[48:57] unto Him verily verily I say unto you
[48:59] hereafter ye shall see the heaven open
[49:03] and the angels of God ascending and
[49:05] descending upon the Son of man what was
[49:09] it Jesus saw Nathanael and saw what was
[49:13] laying on the inside of him
[49:15] there was a light drawing forth light
[49:19] drawing to that light as I was
[49:21] describing a while ago as we come and we
[49:23] draw him we put our little licks of fire
[49:25] together and we're burning in this dark
[49:28] age there was a light coming forth out
[49:30] of Nathanael see Jesus knew where
[49:34] Nathanael was Jesus could the seed
[49:37] Nathanael was underneath that fig tree
[49:39] and he said there's no guile in thee now
[49:43] gal don't mean sinless
[49:45] it's godless amen
[49:50] as I was telling dad and Andrew the
[49:52] other day two people we know that don't
[49:54] have feminists in the Bible Adam and
[49:57] Nathaniel
[49:58] there's no guile and nemeth annual
[50:03] amen some of you get it today some of
[50:06] you get it tomorrow some of you never
[50:08] get it says blessed is the man whom the
[50:18] lord imputeth not iniquity and who
[50:21] spirit there is no God Jesus seen
[50:26] Nathanael seen him in his situation seen
[50:29] him in his spirit and said there's
[50:32] something on the inside of him that's
[50:34] representing me I like that there's a
[50:38] drawing Christ's nose where's your at he
[50:43] knew where he was he's seen him he's
[50:47] seen him down there Christ knows where
[50:50] you are Christ knew that you were draw
[50:54] closer to him he knew that he could
[50:58] shine that light and you would start
[50:59] growing to that light aren't you glad
[51:03] for how Christ knows where you was but
[51:08] where you will be amen brother branham
[51:14] tells the story about how that says a
[51:17] while ago there was such a terrible
[51:19] emergency says we haven't been taking
[51:22] calls during these meetings said but
[51:24] there was a little lady who called who
[51:27] was in a desperate condition and my wife
[51:31] come into the room and said honey I hate
[51:34] to call you from your study but just an
[51:38] awful emergency said this woman's fixing
[51:42] to commit suicide so I got on the phone
[51:45] and while I was standing at the phone
[51:48] the Holy Spirit told her just who she
[51:52] was what she was doing how she was
[51:58] dressed what was the matter with her and
[52:02] what caused it and he healed her right
[52:07] there while standing on the phone
[52:13] says oh I tell you I heard crying her
[52:18] mother screaming holding onto her and
[52:20] everything and just praising the Lord
[52:24] God knew where she was
[52:27] God knew where she was standing and God
[52:32] could see her another little story I'd
[52:36] like to tell you many of you have heard
[52:39] the story about the the infidel man how
[52:42] that brother branham and brother banks
[52:46] woods would would go hunting brother

[53:01] hollows over here said and I'd like to
[53:03] take you I said but there the man he's
[53:06] an infidel he hates preachers he was
[53:11] over in there Kentucky and so so brother
[53:16] bran said well that's that's fine you
[53:19] know we're just gonna go squirrel
[53:21] hunting so they go get in the truck and
[53:24] they go up and down over the hills in
[53:26] the valleys and and there they come upon
[53:28] two two men sitting underneath an apple
[53:31] tree and so brother woods banks woods he
[53:36] got out and he began to talk to the man
[53:39] and said said sir I'd like to ask you
[53:42] for hunting permission like do some
[53:44] squirrel hunting said said I'm I'm bank

[53:58] wherever you'd like to hear I said go
[54:01] ahead and he said well well you see I
[54:04] also have my pastor with me and the
[54:08] infidel said don't tell me you've gotten
[54:10] so low that you have to carry a pastor
[54:12] around with you he said well brother
[54:18] Branham says you know that was about the
[54:19] time that I figured I better get out to

[54:25] over and and they've been hunting for
[54:26] about two weeks now he says he's he's

[54:41] brother Brett says probably thinking
[54:43] some preacher some preacher and they're
[54:46] sitting there and and he says how you do
[54:49] how you do he says well I the reason why
[54:54] I have such an issue with you preachers
[54:56] is you're barking up the wrong tree that
[55:01] is a lying dog so what a lying dog is
[55:04] it'll run over here to tree or squirrel
[55:06] and the squirrel supposed to be up there
[55:08] but there's nothing there and it
[55:11] continues to bark and bark and bark and
[55:13] bark and bark at this tree but there's
[55:14] no squirrel upper that is a lying dog
[55:17] and he says you know there there ain't
[55:21] no God up there said I've looked all
[55:23] around he said well that's that's your
[55:26] own opinion he says I'm a pet I mean I'm
[55:28] an infidel he said well I ain't much to
[55:31] be proud of I don't think well maybe
[55:34] you're right
[55:34] maybe you're right so he got to talking
[55:38] there and seen it that apple tree there
[55:41] and he said nice apple tree he said and
[55:44] something happened said mind if I have
[55:47] an apple so he picks up this nice Apple
[55:50] looks at it and begins to eat it there a
[55:54] little bit and and so he says that
[55:56] brother banks wanted to to tell tell
[56:00] this man said who he was as his pastor
[56:02] brother Brant said no no don't don't do
[56:04] that don't don't tell him who I am and

[1:06:17] that soldier boy the story is told by
[1:06:24] brother Bisco that shortly after that
[1:06:27] meeting in Dawson Creek they brother
[1:06:30] Brandon brother Bisco and them had Trant
[1:06:32] planned to hunt up in the Northern
[1:06:34] Territory so after the meeting they they
[1:06:37] drove for hundreds of miles up in the
[1:06:40] Northern Territory getting ready to go
[1:06:41] hunting and they drove for these
[1:06:45] hundreds of miles and and to be able to
[1:06:47] find someone in this time you know it's
[1:06:50] not like it is today cell phones
[1:06:52] everywhere can track and can text and
[1:06:55] say where you add I'm coming to you
[1:06:57] nobody could pinpoint where you was
[1:07:01] but the Bisco says that they're at this
[1:07:03] little little kind of like a house
[1:07:05] little second section and and they go to
[1:07:08] eat at this little diner that there's
[1:07:10] they're there in this area and they're
[1:07:13] eating and here comes a man in and this
[1:07:16] soldier boy and this soldier boy comes
[1:07:19] up and and starts talking to brother
[1:07:21] branham there and brother branham just
[1:07:23] keeps eating his soup
[1:07:25] Mystikal says and describes the
[1:07:27] situation what happened and and what
[1:07:30] he's going through in it and both of
[1:07:33] bisco thought well surely he'll you know
[1:07:35] we'll pray for him right here
[1:07:36] you know just brother I'm sitting on
[1:07:38] okay just kept eating and so a little
[1:07:43] later and they said just to be able to
[1:07:46] find us was a miracle God allowed them
[1:07:52] to be at this place and said they walk
[1:07:57] out brother best school was standing
[1:08:00] there talking with the other man that's
[1:08:01] with this soldier boy and brother
[1:08:04] branham he takes and he takes the
[1:08:07] soldier boy by the shoulder he begins to
[1:08:10] walk him down the street and he's
[1:08:13] walking down the street and brother
[1:08:15] Bissell says that he's reading this
[1:08:17] man's life story what he's went through
[1:08:21] what spirit that's laying up on him he
[1:08:25] says you got a hug you got a wife and a
[1:08:27] son

[1:08:33] and that soldier boy brother Briscoe
[1:08:35] says that soldier boy turns around and
[1:08:37] starts hollering I'm free I'm free I'm
[1:08:41] free I'm free it runs down through there
[1:08:45] now there's a there's a picture of
[1:08:48] brother Branham maybe some of you've
[1:08:49] seen that he's standing in an almost a
[1:08:52] jean shirt and blue jeans and got a
[1:08:56] cowboy hat on turned a little sideways
[1:08:58] and and he's got a beard and a little
[1:09:03] bit of a beard whiskers there but you
[1:09:06] know had it not been for that happening
[1:09:10] they say that there never would have
[1:09:13] been that picture
[1:09:15] god knows where you're at
[1:09:19] God knows there's a light on the inside
[1:09:23] of you dad was up in Alaska preaching
[1:09:30] I'll tell you this here dad was in
[1:09:33] Alaska preaching and he was preaching
[1:09:36] and as he was preaching he was preaching
[1:09:38] God knows where you're all were you at
[1:09:40] where you're at and as he's preaching
[1:09:43] they have a bullhorn on the outside of
[1:09:46] this little church and it's almost like
[1:09:48] an Eskimo village area there that he
[1:09:50] that he was preaching in and as he's
[1:09:53] preaching God knows where you're at he's
[1:09:55] describing he says you might be a wall
[1:09:58] from the arming and you're up here
[1:10:03] running said but God knows where you're
[1:10:09] at the man sitting down the road that
[1:10:13] was a wall from the army setting in his
[1:10:16] truck said well I might as well go up
[1:10:18] there because he's talking about me
[1:10:23] that man was from Covington Virginia
[1:10:27] AWOL from the Army hidin in Alaska and
[1:10:31] God knew where he was at that moment at
[1:10:36] that time and knew how to draw him out
[1:10:39] and call him forth that man came in and
[1:10:43] - as far as we know he's still in the
[1:10:45] message today aren't you glad of that
[1:10:49] that God knows where you're at I'll tell
[1:10:53] you a little personal testimony of my
[1:10:55] own so I'd had a motorcycle and I would
[1:11:01] ride up and down the 33 up in the the
[1:11:04] mountains there on the 33 west going
[1:11:07] over to West Virginia there and me and
[1:11:10] my buddies we'd go up and down this
[1:11:12] mountain riding on their motorcycles and
[1:11:14] and so one day I was kind of the leader
[1:11:17] on the on that day and I went up through
[1:11:20] there and I hit a marker in the road and
[1:11:23] kind of got some some gravels underneath
[1:11:25] my back tire and my back tire slid out
[1:11:28] from underneath of me and I probably
[1:11:30] wasn't going as fast as I should have
[1:11:32] been
[1:11:33] you know and so my back tire slid up
[1:11:35] underneath out from underneath of me and
[1:11:37] and I started to roll my motorcycle hits
[1:11:41] the rock wall bounces into the other
[1:11:44] lane and I'm laying there in the ditch
[1:11:46] I'm just thinking I'm alive thank the
[1:11:53] Lord I'm alive and so one of my buddy
[1:11:54] come over grab me about my jacket and
[1:11:57] shakes me he said spit sir you did you
[1:11:59] did no no I'm not just let me lay here
[1:12:03] for a minute so after we got up and got
[1:12:08] the bike out the road and I told told my
[1:12:11] buddies hey you called this man said
[1:12:14] he's my buddy John Hinton I said he'll
[1:12:17] come pick me up I said he won't tell
[1:12:20] nobody I know he won't and so I knew
[1:12:26] them guys wouldn't tell nobody so I
[1:12:28] called Cassie I said hey meet me at the
[1:12:31] Honda dealership she said okay what's
[1:12:33] going on us I just meet me over there
[1:12:35] she said well I knew something was going
[1:12:37] on so she met me over there picked me up
[1:12:39] and by then now she knows that hey I've
[1:12:42] done wrecked and and I said don't you
[1:12:44] dare tell nobody
[1:12:45] because if mama finds out that I wrecked
[1:12:48] on my motorcycle
[1:12:49] she'll kill me she hated that thing
[1:12:53] anyhow so of course you know nobody's
[1:12:57] telling nobody

[1:15:58] the river there was a tree of life which
[1:16:02] bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded
[1:16:04] her fruit every month and the leaves of
[1:16:08] the tree were for the healing of the
[1:16:11] nation's
[1:16:12] and there shall be no more curse but the
[1:16:18] throne of God and the lamb shall be in
[1:16:22] it and his servants shall serve Him and
