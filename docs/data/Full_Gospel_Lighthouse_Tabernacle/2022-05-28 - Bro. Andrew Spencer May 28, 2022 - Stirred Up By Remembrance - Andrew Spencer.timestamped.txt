[43:49] we look unto you the author and the

[43:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[43:57] ii peter 1 and 10
[44:00] wherefore the rather brethren give
[44:01] diligence to make your calling and
[44:03] election sure
[44:05] for if you do these things you shall
[44:07] never fall
[44:09] for so an entrance shall be ministered
[44:11] unto you abundantly in the everlasting
[44:13] kingdom of our lord and savior jesus
[44:15] christ
[44:16] wherefore i will not be negligent
[44:19] to put you always in remembrance of
[44:21] these things
[44:22] though you know them and be established
[44:25] in the present truth
[44:27] i think it meet as long as i am in this
[44:29] tabernacle to stir you up
[44:32] by putting you in remembrance
[44:35] if you'll skip down to chapter 3 verse
[44:38] 1.
[44:41] notice what peter was declaring to us
[44:44] you can also find this in the book of
[44:45] timothy of stirring up the gift that was
[44:48] placed in there
[44:50] but notice what peter is bringing unto
[44:52] us he is saying to us stirring up that
[44:54] which was already there it was something
[44:57] that they had already become acquainted
[44:59] with
[45:00] it's something that they knew
[45:03] ii peter 3 and 1 in this second epistle
[45:05] beloved i now write unto you in both
[45:07] which i stir up
[45:09] your pure minds by the way of
[45:10] remembrance
[45:12] that you may be mindful of the words
[45:13] which were spoken before by the holy
[45:15] prophets and the commandment
[45:17] of us the apostles
[45:19] of the lord and savior knowing this
[45:23] first that there shall come in the last
[45:25] day scoffers walking after their own
[45:27] lust i'd say we're here
[45:30] have you ever seen a day when men are
[45:32] walking after their own lust like this
[45:34] day
[45:36] i'd say this is a prophetic word
[45:38] and saying where is the promise of his
[45:40] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[45:42] and all things continue as they were
[45:45] from the beginning of the creation
[45:47] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[45:49] that by the word of god the heavens were
[45:51] of old and the earth standing out of
[45:53] water and in the water whereby the world
[45:56] that then was being overflowed with
[45:58] water perished but the heavens and the
[46:01] earth which are now by the same word are
[46:03] kept in store reserved under fire
[46:05] against the day of judgment
[46:07] and perdition of ungodly men but beloved
[46:10] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[46:12] one day with the lord as as a thousand
[46:15] years and a thousand years as one day
[46:18] the lord is not slack concerning his
[46:21] promise as some men count slackness but
[46:23] is longsuffering to us word not willing
[46:26] that any should perish that all should
[46:28] come to repentance but the day of the
[46:31] lord will come as a thief in the night
[46:34] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[46:36] with a great noise and the elements
[46:38] shall melt with fervent heat and the
[46:40] earth also and the works that are
[46:42] therein shall be burned up seeing then
[46:44] that all these things shall be dissolved
[46:47] what manner of persons ought you to be
[46:50] in all holy conversation
[46:53] and godliness may god bless his word he
[46:56] may be seated in the presence of the
[46:57] lord i'd like to take a thought this
[46:59] this evening on stirred up
[47:02] stirred up by remembrance and i know
[47:04] that this weekend in the americans
[47:07] here for the americans that are
[47:09] listening that this weekend is a very
[47:11] special weekend for us it's it's a
[47:13] memorial day weekend we have a extra
[47:15] long holiday holiday weekend
[47:19] and every every business typically re
[47:22] honors that day it's a day it's a day in
[47:25] american history where we observe on the
[47:28] last day of the month of may honoring
[47:30] the men and women that fell
[47:33] fell and died in in the u.s military
[47:37] who's died serving in the us military
[47:39] it's a day when it's a day when we
[47:41] remember
[47:42] we remember where we came from and we
[47:45] remember the men that that that gave
[47:47] their life for freedom and if you go to
[47:50] studying out the actual actual win win
[47:53] when when the memorial day was started
[47:55] you'll find that that they originally
[47:57] called it a decoration day in general
[47:59] logan in 1868 after the civil war after
[48:03] they had went and all of those men that
[48:05] had died there they they called for a
[48:07] nationwide remembrance to honor those
[48:10] fallen soldiers that had died in in such
[48:13] a chaotic chaotic war and and those men
[48:16] and what they would do in the springtime
[48:18] at the end of may it started on may the
[48:20] 30th and there they would go and they
[48:22] would decorate these these fallen
[48:24] soldiers and they would go and decorate
[48:27] their decorate their graves with the
[48:29] springtime flowers and they would go and
[48:31] pay homage under these men that that
[48:33] were willing to give their life for home
[48:35] and give their life for freedom and i i
[48:37] believe that it that if we are ever
[48:39] living in a time to remember our
[48:41] freedoms we're certainly living in a
[48:43] time or right now like never before men
[48:46] are forgetting they're forgetting their
[48:48] freedoms they're for greed they're
[48:49] forgetting what men they they came to
[48:51] this nation for how they left england
[48:54] and how they left their homeland just to
[48:56] come here and start over and under the
[48:58] freedom of worship under the freedom of
[49:00] religion and if there ever was a time to
[49:03] remember where we came from how that men
[49:05] fought for our freedoms in the
[49:07] revolutionary war how that men fought
[49:09] for our freedoms in in the si in the
[49:11] civil war and how men gave their lives
[49:13] and bled on the battlefields so that you
[49:16] and i could stand here and preach this
[49:18] message and preach the power of
[49:20] pentecost and preach this beautiful
[49:22] message that each and every one of us
[49:24] love here i think it's a time that we
[49:26] ought to pay homage not just to fall and
[49:28] fall fallen fallen men and soldiers in
[49:31] wars but we ought to we ought to honor
[49:33] men like trailblazers like brother homer
[49:35] fraser like brother henry greene brother
[49:37] billy andrews brother biscuit all of
[49:40] these great men that went on before us i
[49:41] think it's a time that we we ought to
[49:43] spay and pay our time a memorial and
[49:46] remember where we were as a message how
[49:48] that how did it we we only had it in we
[49:50] only had it in maybe tape form or on
[49:52] reel to reel but now it's in everybody's
[49:55] hands it's accessible to everybody and i
[49:57] think it's uh it's a time that we ought
[49:59] to remember where the message is at
[50:01] today and and to think that like never
[50:03] before there's a people on the face of
[50:05] the earth that's identified with a
[50:07] message that they're known by that
[50:09] message i think it's a time that we
[50:10] ought to stir up our remember stir up
[50:13] what's been given unto us something that
[50:15] we know it's it's not something we're
[50:17] not a schoolgirl or any squirrel girl
[50:19] anymore we know who we are we we know
[50:21] we've got the the predestinated wedding
[50:24] band of grace on our hand we we know
[50:26] what jesus came and did for us we know
[50:28] what he did there on the cross we we
[50:30] know what the lamb came and did he
[50:32] opened up the seals and he showed us who
[50:34] we are i think it's a time as sons and
[50:37] daughters of god that we ought to
[50:38] remember where we came from not just let
[50:41] every devil in hell try to come and make
[50:43] us forget what happened 50 or 60 years
[50:46] ago but i think it's a time like never
[50:48] before that we ought to rise up in the
[50:50] liberty of jesus christ and remember
[50:52] what god did for us and if god did it
[50:55] then he can still do it right now i
[50:57] think it's a time like never before not
[50:59] only just to stir it up in our mind but
[51:01] we ought to stir it up in hell and tell
[51:03] the devil that the same mighty angel
[51:05] that was there in 1950 is the same
[51:07] mighty angel that's here right now i'm
[51:09] not just talking about stirring up your
[51:11] heart i'm talking about stirring up your
[51:13] minds that what's been deposited it's a
[51:15] time like never before that we ought to
[51:17] remember that this ain't a closed book
[51:19] church it's an open book church it ain't
[51:22] a church that's been bound by creeds and
[51:24] bound by dogmas it's a time like never
[51:26] before to shore up our minds that we're
[51:28] a free church we've got liberty in the
[51:31] house of god we've got a liberty to
[51:33] worship we've got a liberty to praise
[51:35] there is freedom if there ever was a
[51:37] time to remember i say this is a day of
[51:40] memorial where we remember what jesus
[51:43] did for us
[51:47] i say it's a day of memory for the bride
[51:50] of jesus christ
[51:56] november 19
[51:58] in 1863
[52:00] when our president abraham lincoln
[52:03] stood and gave the gettysburg address
[52:06] after one of what was one of the
[52:08] bloodiest bass
[52:10] in the silver war
[52:13] there it was estimated that 46 000 to 51
[52:16] 000
[52:17] men died in that battle
[52:19] and here
[52:21] here abraham lincoln is standing there
[52:23] standing on a stage standing on a
[52:25] battlefield where these men had gave
[52:28] their precious life
[52:29] fighting for fighting for what they
[52:31] thought was right i don't care what side
[52:33] you think you're on i don't care where
[52:35] you came from or what not these men gave
[52:38] their life they weren't just out there
[52:40] they weren't just out there because
[52:41] because they somebody somebody was
[52:43] somebody had called them they were out
[52:45] there fighting
[52:46] and if you're willing to fight for
[52:48] something you you get behind it and
[52:50] these men were behind they were behind
[52:52] the ideas of their generals and and
[52:55] abraham lincoln stood up there and he
[52:57] said and you you can go and read you can
[52:59] go and read the great gettysburg address
[53:02] and you can everybody knows how it
[53:03] starts out and but they they don't
[53:06] recognize they don't recognize the depth
[53:08] of that meeting or the depth of that
[53:10] speech but abraham lincoln stood there
[53:13] and he said the world will little note
[53:15] nor long remember what we say here but
[53:17] he said they can never forget what these
[53:19] men did here
[53:21] and you may you may forget what i say
[53:23] here but i want you to know there is a
[53:25] legacy that is standing behind this
[53:28] pulpit not just of ron spencer not just
[53:31] of homer frazier but this is a
[53:33] lighthouse for the message of jesus
[53:36] christ
[53:37] you may forget what is spoken
[53:39] necessarily tonight but you'll remember
[53:41] one of these days i hope you're not like
[53:44] lot's wife i hope you're not like judah
[53:46] sent you that you wish you wouldn't have
[53:47] sold him out for this
[53:49] but these men at the silver war these
[53:52] men were fighting for what they thought
[53:54] was right faulting fighting for their
[53:56] beliefs
[53:57] it could never be forgotten what they
[53:58] did there and america wants to thrash
[54:01] that out
[54:04] america wants to dismember our country
[54:06] and try to rip us apart try to bring in
[54:09] a spirit of division amongst americans
[54:14] try to separate us and cause another
[54:16] civil war again they're going to get it
[54:19] they're going to get it but when when it
[54:21] when all of that breaks out i'm not
[54:22] going to be here they're asking for
[54:25] another war but i'm going to be gone
[54:28] they're trying to say what happened
[54:30] there and what happened with slavery
[54:32] didn't happen they tried to pretend that
[54:33] it happened they try to rob it out of
[54:35] our history books they try to take the
[54:37] holocaust out of our books but you ask
[54:40] you ask one of those jews over there in
[54:41] that homeland they know that that
[54:43] holocaust was real they remember
[54:47] they try to say that it was just a fig
[54:49] in a figment of man's imagination that
[54:52] those things happen but you go and talk
[54:54] to somebody that was in world war one in
[54:56] world war ii they know that it was real
[54:58] it wasn't just a bad memory it happened
[55:01] bad things happen in war
[55:05] they don't they want to try to say that
[55:06] it didn't happen they try to say that
[55:08] there was not a mighty angel that met a
[55:10] man in a cave
[55:13] this ain't just somebody's memory they
[55:15] try to say that there was no 16 men that
[55:17] fell off fell off a bridge they want to
[55:19] say there was no man up there on the
[55:21] finland border that had that had been
[55:23] crumbled up that had been crumbled up by
[55:25] a car wreck
[55:27] this ain't just some memory church there
[55:29] was somebody that was behind it
[55:34] before it ever happened
[55:36] before it ever took place
[55:39] the vision that spoke that this boy
[55:41] would get up off the ground he said he
[55:43] said if he's not above the ground in
[55:45] five minutes call me a false prophet
[55:48] that little boy didn't raise up and say
[55:50] he was a false prophet because he was
[55:52] walking where he was once dead
[55:55] how could i stand here and say that
[55:57] jesus christ is no longer alive when
[56:00] he's living right here this ain't just a
[56:02] memory this ain't just a hope so this is
[56:06] the living christ amongst the church
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:19] peter said stir up your remembrance
[56:22] stir up your remembrance you see
[56:24] you see that
[56:26] we're a church we're a church that knows
[56:28] how to sing you don't know like i know
[56:32] because what it does it stirs up our
[56:35] remembrance i remember what i was i
[56:38] remember what the devil tried to talk me
[56:39] into i remember how he tried to kill me
[56:42] i remember how he did this that and the
[56:44] other but you don't know like i know
[56:47] what he did for me
[56:49] what is that song doing it's not just
[56:51] stirring up my remembrance it's stirring
[56:53] up god's remembrance he remember how he
[56:55] saved you he remember how he fields you
[56:58] [Applause]
[57:08] william branham comes and he
[57:11] he preaches one of the most powerful
[57:12] messages
[57:14] on spiritual amnesia
[57:16] brother branham comes and he grabs from
[57:18] amos chapter 3
[57:20] and said hear this word that the lord
[57:21] has spoken against you
[57:23] o children of israel against the whole
[57:25] family which i
[57:26] brought up from the land of egypt and
[57:28] saying
[57:29] you only have i known
[57:31] of all the families of the earth
[57:33] therefore i will punish you for your
[57:35] iniquities
[57:37] here amos is going down to samaria he's
[57:40] going down to samara and he was coming
[57:41] to this he was coming to this great city
[57:43] where where sin had been heaped on every
[57:45] side and the ministers had all gotten
[57:47] away from from the word of god they had
[57:50] they had they hadn't had a prophet in
[57:52] long years
[57:53] and here when amos comes he he found
[57:55] them and they were so decayed so morally
[57:58] corrupted it was a great time with and
[58:00] it was a terrible time that that where
[58:03] there was women in that city had become
[58:05] almost like they they were here in the
[58:07] united states he said they become they
[58:09] had become corrupt everything that a god
[58:12] expected out of them they went right the
[58:14] other way he said we find out that it's
[58:16] a great place where they had dances on
[58:18] the street the women so immorally
[58:20] stripping their clothes off and so forth
[58:22] like a striptease of course that was a
[58:24] public museum in them days now it's
[58:26] every day just like the just let the
[58:29] weather get hot you don't have to go in
[58:31] to any show they're out there on the
[58:33] street anywhere anyhow shame on you
[58:35] women to do such a thing like that
[58:37] aren't you ashamed of yourself
[58:39] here amos he he found them in that day
[58:41] and they had a bad case of a disease
[58:44] spiritual amnesia he said and that's
[58:46] just exactly what we've got today
[58:49] he said but we find out that israel
[58:51] exposed or got exposed to the world and
[58:54] it fell into this rut and the prophet
[58:55] was sent to dig them out of it he said
[58:58] if he could get he if he could and if he
[59:00] could and to tell them god by his grace
[59:03] had chose israel
[59:05] from the rest of the families on earth
[59:07] he said grace did that
[59:10] here they were here they were they got
[59:12] in this condition but the prophet was
[59:14] sent to get them out of that rut
[59:17] aren't you thankful that even though
[59:19] america's interrupt we had a prophet
[59:22] a people that were chosen a people that
[59:24] were chosen by god though you may have
[59:26] been in the rut there was a prophet that
[59:29] came by your way
[59:33] there was somebody that was willing to
[59:35] get down in the trenches for a people
[59:38] that though it looked like they weren't
[59:39] children of god though it looked like
[59:41] they should be ashamed though it looked
[59:43] like they shouldn't be serving god there
[59:45] was a prophet that stood in this day
[59:48] that wasn't ashamed to call black black
[59:50] and white white
[59:51] [Applause]
[59:56] he said grace
[59:57] had did that he had given them the
[59:59] choice lands he'd give them houses that
[1:00:01] they they never had to build god did
[1:00:03] that he chose him he gave them farms
[1:00:05] they never had to bought he gave he gave
[1:00:08] them food that they never had to plant
[1:00:09] he gave them wells they never had to dig
[1:00:12] he gave them victories that they never
[1:00:13] had to want he gave them grace that they
[1:00:15] never had to merit it god did that by
[1:00:18] his grace for this people israel his own
[1:00:21] chosen his beloved and he said in the
[1:00:23] bible he found her in the field as a
[1:00:25] little girl sitting in her own blood and
[1:00:28] he watched her and he cleaned her up
[1:00:31] and what he done but after god showed
[1:00:33] all of these mercies she got rich and
[1:00:36] she got amnesia and she forgot all
[1:00:38] about where these things come from
[1:00:44] and i'm afraid that america has forgot
[1:00:46] her liberty
[1:00:48] i'm afraid that she doesn't have a
[1:00:50] memory and there's so many people today
[1:00:52] the church the church world in this last
[1:00:55] days they've forgotten what a testimony
[1:00:57] of a real christian means
[1:00:59] i'm afraid that that we've been blessed
[1:01:01] beyond measure i'm afraid that we've
[1:01:03] been blessed when we come in and blessed
[1:01:05] when we go out he's made us ahead and
[1:01:08] not the tale but i'm afraid that too
[1:01:10] many times we we wallow around like a
[1:01:12] hog and we we're eating those apples but
[1:01:15] we never look up
[1:01:16] to see where they're coming from
[1:01:18] to think where you are standing at today
[1:01:21] to think about your liberties to think
[1:01:23] about where you are in the message to
[1:01:25] think about what god has done for you
[1:01:27] you'd be a fool to sit there and not
[1:01:29] thank god for it
[1:01:37] but when jesus came
[1:01:39] when jesus came they forgot
[1:01:41] they had forgot what the bible said that
[1:01:43] a virgin shall conceive they had forgot
[1:01:45] that moses had said that the lord our
[1:01:47] god would raise up a prophet like unto
[1:01:49] myself they'd forgot those things and
[1:01:51] when jesus was standing there because of
[1:01:54] this spiritual amnesia that was on them
[1:01:56] they couldn't recognize the the original
[1:01:59] life that was standing there
[1:02:02] they couldn't remember
[1:02:04] they couldn't remember where what what
[1:02:06] they were really doing there they they
[1:02:08] stood there and all their feasts they
[1:02:10] stood there and and all their pump and
[1:02:11] their splendor they stood there and they
[1:02:13] had dressed out they were they they
[1:02:15] looked apart but they forgot
[1:02:19] they forgot what god called them to be
[1:02:22] and israel every single time that she
[1:02:24] would get out of the land she would get
[1:02:26] out of her place and when the bride of
[1:02:28] jesus christ gets off of this promised
[1:02:31] word
[1:02:33] when you get out of the promised word
[1:02:34] for your day you are getting out of your
[1:02:36] position and you're beginning to forget
[1:02:39] what god called you to be god didn't
[1:02:42] call you to be no slave god didn't call
[1:02:44] you to be a children of fear god did not
[1:02:46] call you to be a children of doubt
[1:02:50] he called you to be serpent bruisers
[1:02:52] devil stoppers that when the enemy comes
[1:02:55] up against you you look at the devil and
[1:02:57] say you remember me
[1:03:00] you remember how you lost last time
[1:03:02] remember you're going to lose this time
[1:03:04] remember me devil
[1:03:06] i'm the same devil that whipped you 15
[1:03:08] years ago i'm the same man i'm the same
[1:03:12] man i may look different i may talk just
[1:03:14] a little bit different i may be a little
[1:03:16] bit knowledgeable in the message of
[1:03:18] jesus christ but i'm the same man
[1:03:21] i'm the same man that whips you when you
[1:03:23] accuse me falsely i'm the same man that
[1:03:26] knows my sword i know what it can do i'm
[1:03:29] the same man
[1:03:34] remember me devil
[1:03:39] i'd say when jesus was put into a tomb
[1:03:42] and it looked like he was going like all
[1:03:44] hope was gone
[1:03:45] it looked like every every fear that
[1:03:47] they had was completely rocked but when
[1:03:50] he went in that tomb but when he come
[1:03:52] out of that tomb
[1:03:54] i'd say he took a look around and looked
[1:03:56] at those demons said remember me
[1:03:59] you just i just visited you down there
[1:04:01] in hell but remember me i'm the same one
[1:04:04] i've got 120 40 days from this time
[1:04:08] that's going to be filled with my spirit
[1:04:10] my life my power
[1:04:18] i don't have this by scripture
[1:04:20] but i could i i just i could imagine
[1:04:23] peter and his boldness coming out say
[1:04:25] you remember me
[1:04:30] i'd say it's a time in your life that
[1:04:32] you need to look up at the devil
[1:04:35] and said i have forgotten what you
[1:04:38] accused me of but i have remembered what
[1:04:40] god thought of me
[1:04:44] i'd say it's a time to remember
[1:04:48] i'm wondering sometimes if we don't
[1:04:50] forget
[1:04:52] the things that come from him
[1:04:55] remember he's the one who blessed you
[1:04:58] remember he's the one who saved you
[1:05:00] remember he's the one who healed you
[1:05:02] remember he's the one that kept you
[1:05:05] remember he's the one that opened your
[1:05:06] eyes remember he's the one that he saved
[1:05:09] you from a car wreck remember he's the
[1:05:11] one that
[1:05:12] got you out of that financial trouble
[1:05:14] when you look like he was in bankruptcy
[1:05:16] remember
[1:05:18] remember he was the one that came
[1:05:21] looking for you when everybody else had
[1:05:23] turned you down when the world had
[1:05:25] flipped you upside down
[1:05:27] everybody else had turned the woman away
[1:05:30] but he remembered her
[1:05:32] there was some men that walked through
[1:05:34] her and said no i don't want her she's
[1:05:36] done being used up but jesus said i have
[1:05:38] remembered her i have come by this well
[1:05:41] because i got a need for her
[1:05:46] and you sit there and you've got your
[1:05:48] stone in your hand wanting to throw it
[1:05:50] at this woman
[1:05:52] you without sin cast the first stone
[1:05:57] don't you remember where you came from
[1:06:03] then why shouldn't these young people
[1:06:05] have a chance of the word of god
[1:06:09] you were a prodigy one time you were a
[1:06:12] castaway at one time remember where you
[1:06:14] were
[1:06:17] memory ain't always a bad thing it can
[1:06:19] be used for the glory of the lord
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:31] if you can always remember that god is
[1:06:33] present
[1:06:35] if you could always remember
[1:06:37] if you can always remember that he said
[1:06:39] i'll never leave you and i'll never
[1:06:40] forsake you
[1:06:41] if you can remember that his that his
[1:06:43] angels are given charge over you to keep
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:47] that that the angels that the bible said
[1:06:49] in psalms 34
[1:06:51] that that the angels of god are encamped
[1:06:53] about them that fear him so matter no
[1:06:55] matter where you see them or not
[1:06:58] i know some of you been blessed to be
[1:07:00] able to see a flicker of light every
[1:07:02] once in a while or maybe see the pillar
[1:07:04] of fire or maybe see something
[1:07:05] supernatural but whether you see it or
[1:07:07] whether you don't
[1:07:08] whether you see the angel standing here
[1:07:10] or whether you feel him or don't he's
[1:07:12] here
[1:07:13] and i want to say this by the word of
[1:07:14] the lord he said i'll be with you even
[1:07:17] in you to the end of the world
[1:07:19] don't ever forget it
[1:07:21] i know he's here right now don't ever
[1:07:23] forget it i know he's here to save you
[1:07:25] from your backslidden condition don't
[1:07:27] ever forget it
[1:07:29] satan i want to remind you while i'm
[1:07:31] reminding the church of the living god i
[1:07:33] want to remind you you lost 2 000 years
[1:07:36] ago and you'll lose right now
[1:07:41] you can try to hold them in their
[1:07:42] backspin condition you can try to hold
[1:07:44] them in the in their sickness you can
[1:07:46] try to hold them in their diseases but i
[1:07:48] want to remind you isaiah 53 met in a
[1:07:52] person he was wounded for my
[1:07:53] transgressions he was bruised for my
[1:07:56] iniquities the chastisement of their
[1:07:58] priest was upon him and by his stripes
[1:08:00] you may have tried to stop the redeemer
[1:08:02] from coming
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:05] but it meant the person jesus christ
[1:08:08] i
[1:08:18] there's got to come an awakening
[1:08:21] there's got to come an awakening to
[1:08:23] shake your memory
[1:08:24] and to break the disease of
[1:08:26] of of amnesia
[1:08:29] to remind you who you are
[1:08:31] that's why i've spent the last few weeks
[1:08:33] telling you and bringing you back to the
[1:08:35] fundamental faith of who you are
[1:08:39] you've been predestinated you've been
[1:08:41] chosen but the devil will tell you that
[1:08:44] you're not good enough the devil will
[1:08:46] tell you that there's an all-knowing god
[1:08:48] he can't forget what you did the devil
[1:08:50] would tell you the devil will tell you
[1:08:52] he's infinite he's infinite and he knows
[1:08:54] what you did in your past he knows how
[1:08:56] you tried to cover that up but you can't
[1:08:58] whip him on your own that's why i'm
[1:09:00] trying to give you bible doctrine if
[1:09:03] you're gonna whip anything you gotta
[1:09:04] whip it by the you gotta whip it by the
[1:09:06] word of god
[1:09:07] and the bible said in hebrews 10 that
[1:09:10] there was a remembrance of again made of
[1:09:13] sins every year under those sacrifices
[1:09:17] but it didn't stop there
[1:09:18] it was a remembrance of sin under the
[1:09:20] old law but when you come down to
[1:09:22] hebrews 10 and 16 he said i will put my
[1:09:25] law in their minds and in their hearts
[1:09:26] and in their souls
[1:09:28] and i will remember their sins and their
[1:09:30] iniquities no more
[1:09:32] [Applause]
[1:09:35] oh satan you done lost
[1:09:38] it's in the sea of god's forgetfulness
[1:09:40] and he can try to keep you in your in
[1:09:43] your cage and try to keep you in your
[1:09:45] condition but the blood of jesus christ
[1:09:48] that reaches to the highest mountain and
[1:09:50] goes to the lowest valley
[1:09:53] says i will remember not what you did i
[1:09:56] won't remember what you did yesterday i
[1:09:58] won't remember what you did today
[1:10:01] i will remember what you did 10 years
[1:10:03] ago i won't remember how you talked
[1:10:05] about me
[1:10:10] some of you sitting here said you'd
[1:10:11] never be here
[1:10:14] some of you sitting here saying i'll
[1:10:16] never i'll never worship like that
[1:10:20] some of you sitting here said i'll never
[1:10:21] leave my
[1:10:22] my dead cold religion
[1:10:27] that's all right
[1:10:29] it's good to remember
[1:10:33] because you're not a trophy of hell no
[1:10:34] more
[1:10:36] matter of fact you never was
[1:10:40] i remember i remember the grace of god
[1:10:42] that come walking in this church when
[1:10:44] there were some cheerleaders that come
[1:10:46] in here that look like the world dressed
[1:10:49] like the world
[1:10:50] i remember how they were when they
[1:10:52] walked in here when when you sat there
[1:10:57] some people sit there in their righteous
[1:10:59] indignation and thought my god ain't the
[1:11:01] pastor ever going to preach on a
[1:11:03] clothesline religion
[1:11:05] but you ain't the pastor
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:11] god had a purpose
[1:11:12] and god is as good as his word if there
[1:11:15] is seed
[1:11:19] they look like the world when they
[1:11:20] walked in here but when the message got
[1:11:22] ahold
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:25] when the message got a hold of them i
[1:11:27] want to remind you satan you didn't stop
[1:11:29] them and you won't stop their children
[1:11:35] oh i remember
[1:11:40] you're messing with the wrong guy i got
[1:11:42] a good memory
[1:11:44] i can remember things that you did to me
[1:11:46] i can remember things that you said
[1:11:47] about this congregation i can remember
[1:11:50] things that the devil tried to rob us
[1:11:51] from but i'm here to tell you i'm
[1:11:54] reminded that their lord our god
[1:11:56] he said do not forgive my benefits
[1:12:05] so if we're going to remember something
[1:12:07] let's remember what he said about us
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:12] it's amazing to me how the devil could
[1:12:14] come in and whisper one thing to you
[1:12:18] and you remember everything that he said
[1:12:23] it's amazing
[1:12:25] it's amazing to me
[1:12:30] how the people can come in
[1:12:32] i'd say i remember this and this is what
[1:12:34] the devil said and this is what this one
[1:12:36] did and this is what that one did
[1:12:39] this is what he said about me
[1:12:41] he told me i was no good
[1:12:43] he told me i'd never lived this message
[1:12:45] he he told me and you know what before
[1:12:48] long they're quoting paragraphs that the
[1:12:49] devil said
[1:12:51] but they can't quote one sentence that
[1:12:53] jesus said
[1:12:55] if you can remember what satan said
[1:12:58] about you surely you can remember what
[1:13:00] god said about you
[1:13:01] the bible said now are we the sons of
[1:13:04] god he's going to tell you you're no
[1:13:05] good he's going to tell you you're not
[1:13:07] qualified he's going to tell you you're
[1:13:09] not elected but i happen to be a
[1:13:11] positive and negative kind of person
[1:13:12] anything he tells me i just turn it on
[1:13:15] him if he tells me i ain't caught that
[1:13:17] means i am called if it tells me i'm not
[1:13:19] good enough that means i am good enough
[1:13:21] if it tells me i'm not elect that means
[1:13:23] i am a less if it tells me i can't be
[1:13:25] healed that means i am healed
[1:13:29] i remember what jesus said about me and
[1:13:31] i refute the devil and rebuke him
[1:13:35] that tries to tell the children of god
[1:13:37] that they can't be healed that they
[1:13:39] can't be delivered that they can't be
[1:13:41] free
[1:13:42] i remember what jesus said when the sun
[1:13:44] is set free is free
[1:13:48] i remember
[1:13:49] [Applause]
[1:13:53] well i remember the day he saved me up
[1:13:56] from my sin and shame i'd come up out of
[1:13:58] that water baptized in jesus name
[1:14:06] [Applause]
[1:14:15] powerful message brother branham
[1:14:16] preached preach it twice on remembering
[1:14:19] the lord
[1:14:20] go and listen to it one's before the
[1:14:21] seals and ones after the vision
[1:14:25] one's before the seals ones after the
[1:14:27] vision over over in 1963 and brother
[1:14:29] branham starts talking about he starts
[1:14:32] talking about a hay burn
[1:14:33] hay burn building
[1:14:35] there in louisville kentucky
[1:14:38] and he's up there on that he's up there
[1:14:40] and he's riding this elevator and he
[1:14:41] said there's these ministers if you'll
[1:14:43] study the message real close you'll find
[1:14:44] out that brother branham was one of
[1:14:45] those ministers he's riding up and he
[1:14:47] said they didn't recognize that one
[1:14:49] minister
[1:14:50] and he said these men these ministers
[1:14:52] were riding up on that riding up on that
[1:14:54] elevator and he said here they come up
[1:14:56] on that elevator got all the way up here
[1:14:59] to the eighth floor and one minister
[1:15:00] looked over at the other minister and
[1:15:02] said
[1:15:02] i believe this is about as high we're
[1:15:04] ever going to get we might as well get
[1:15:06] on off here brother branham said i sat
[1:15:08] there quietly he said i let him say what
[1:15:10] they was going to say and he said dale's
[1:15:12] about to get off and he said i said now
[1:15:14] excuse me sir he said maybe by your own
[1:15:17] merits this is about as high as you can
[1:15:18] get he said but if you can remember
[1:15:21] if you can remember what jesus did by
[1:15:24] his marriage it'll take you higher
[1:15:27] and if you're remembering everything
[1:15:29] that you did you only go so high
[1:15:31] the devil is always wanting to tell you
[1:15:33] that you can't get no higher than this
[1:15:35] but the message of the lord was remember
[1:15:39] remember remember what he did for you
[1:15:41] remember where he brought you from and
[1:15:43] notice my brother and said he said he
[1:15:45] said i like to say something he said if
[1:15:47] i can forget what i was and remember
[1:15:50] what he is if i can remember jesus and
[1:15:52] if i can remember at the cross if i can
[1:15:54] remember what he'd done for me if i
[1:15:56] could remember the hour that he washed
[1:15:57] my sins away and gave me the holy spirit
[1:16:00] to guide me then i'm lifted above
[1:16:02] everything
[1:16:04] that holds this earth i'm lifted above
[1:16:06] every earthly thing into heavenly places
[1:16:10] where i can fellowship with him they are
[1:16:12] in his presence for getting what i ever
[1:16:14] was
[1:16:17] glory to god forgetting all my sins and
[1:16:19] everything because they're in the sea of
[1:16:22] god's forgetfulness for getting all my
[1:16:24] past forgetting everything and remember
[1:16:28] and remember that he made me his own by
[1:16:31] his own death he took my place
[1:16:35] if i could ever forget what i was and
[1:16:37] remember what he said about me
[1:16:42] you remember when brother branham goes
[1:16:43] in that museum that one time and there's
[1:16:45] that colored man that's sitting there
[1:16:46] looking at that glass and there's a
[1:16:48] piece of cloth that is laying there it's
[1:16:49] got a blood stain on it and that that
[1:16:51] black man is sitting there crying and
[1:16:54] weeping and brother begins to speak to
[1:16:56] him he tells him he's a minister he said
[1:16:58] he said can i pray for you and he starts
[1:17:00] turning his attention he said you see
[1:17:02] that cloth right there he said that's
[1:17:04] the blood of abraham lincoln right there
[1:17:06] and he lifted up his shirt and he said
[1:17:07] you see that mark he said that's the
[1:17:10] mark of a slave belt he said it was the
[1:17:12] blood of that man that set me free from
[1:17:14] this slave bell he said oh if a colored
[1:17:17] man a once that was once a slave could
[1:17:20] be set free i could feel that liberation
[1:17:23] because the blood of a man what if the
[1:17:26] sons and daughters of god when they look
[1:17:28] at that old slave belt that shake them
[1:17:30] put on them and told them they never
[1:17:32] lived to serve it or they never left
[1:17:34] rise to sun mentality

[1:18:33] singing it when
[1:18:34] when she was younger

[1:18:38] it

[1:19:31] they still love me
[1:19:33] if you're wondering where they are
[1:19:40] he said but
[1:19:41] he said remember jesus
[1:19:44] remember jesus when the barrel gets
[1:19:46] empty at the house
[1:19:48] and there's no more flowering remember
[1:19:50] jesus when the doctor said there's no
[1:19:51] more chance remember jesus when the
[1:19:54] devil is tempting you remember jesus
[1:19:56] when when he that he remember that he
[1:19:58] will come again that same jesus that was
[1:20:01] taken away from us we're returning like
[1:20:03] manner as we have seen him go into the
[1:20:06] heavens remember
[1:20:08] remember i ain't going to leave you to
[1:20:10] go through tribulation remember he's not
[1:20:12] going to put anything on you that you
[1:20:13] will not be able to bear remember he's
[1:20:15] going to return for you
[1:20:18] remember him
[1:20:21] in in in the rising of the sun brother
[1:20:23] braden brother branham is standing there
[1:20:25] and he's preaching about botany life and
[1:20:27] he said it he
[1:20:28] said that it takes the issue in to raise
[1:20:31] that botany life
[1:20:33] up to what it is
[1:20:34] he said it takes that s-u-n to bring it
[1:20:36] to life he said just like it does the
[1:20:39] s-o-n life it takes the s-o-n light to
[1:20:43] bring these those that are chosen and
[1:20:45] those that are predestinated it takes
[1:20:47] that same s o n light
[1:20:50] and this is what amazes that amazes me
[1:20:53] when jesus was standing back there
[1:20:55] before before there was a molecule
[1:20:58] before there was an atom that ever was
[1:21:00] spoken to existence he had in his mind
[1:21:03] whatever seed would be
[1:21:06] and when he planted the seed he knew
[1:21:09] what it was going to be he knew what it
[1:21:11] was going to come up forth
[1:21:14] and to think
[1:21:15] when you plant corn you get corn
[1:21:19] and when jesus was planting corn to
[1:21:21] think that seed had a memory in it
[1:21:24] to remember what it was supposed to be
[1:21:26] like let your mind loose just go to a
[1:21:29] garden just for a minute put your
[1:21:30] strawberries in put your potatoes in put
[1:21:33] your maters in there remember it's
[1:21:35] something powerful
[1:21:37] if a little seed can remember what it
[1:21:39] was destined to be
[1:21:43] he didn't wake up and say one day i'm
[1:21:44] gonna be a tomater when you're supposed
[1:21:46] to be a corn
[1:21:48] he didn't wake up and say you know what
[1:21:50] i'm supposed to be i'm supposed to be a
[1:21:53] corn stalk but today i'm gonna identify
[1:21:55] myself as a strawberry
[1:21:57] it remembered what god destined it to be
[1:22:00] so what he put in the ground has got to
[1:22:02] come up
[1:22:03] and brother branham said that on that
[1:22:05] day on that resurrection morning he said
[1:22:07] there our bodies was laying in the dust
[1:22:10] of the earth he said our attributes what
[1:22:13] we were was in him he said there we were
[1:22:15] in the dust of the earth he said but up
[1:22:17] in heaven there was a book of memory
[1:22:20] i say that when jesus was on the cross
[1:22:22] he could remember this wasn't just for
[1:22:25] me this is for every son and daughter of
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:29] and jesus begin to remember this is for
[1:22:32] fred perry this is for gabriel spencer
[1:22:34] this is for brenda klein this is for
[1:22:36] jeanetta thompson this is for randall
[1:22:39] griffith
[1:22:42] why was john weeping and rejoicing in
[1:22:44] the very second next sections in his
[1:22:47] life
[1:22:47] he was weeping because there was nobody
[1:22:50] that was found worthy to reach up and
[1:22:52] take the book
[1:22:56] i don't happen to believe that he turned
[1:22:58] from weeping to rejoicing just because
[1:23:00] he saw my name or because he saw jeffrey
[1:23:03] thomas's name i happen to believe that
[1:23:05] john saw his name
[1:23:08] you may not understand why sister rachel
[1:23:10] shouts like she shouts her brother
[1:23:12] jordan shouts like he shouts or if
[1:23:14] sister anna shouts like she sats or
[1:23:16] sister katie shouts like sea salts
[1:23:20] but if you saw your name like we saw our
[1:23:23] name
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:26] john said i everything in heaven and
[1:23:29] everything in earth heard i said
[1:23:31] blessings honor and glory because he saw
[1:23:34] his name there and if you would ever get
[1:23:36] yourself and remember
[1:23:39] and remember that he paid for you
[1:23:41] remember that he died for you
[1:23:45] oh what's going to happen
[1:23:47] jericho was going to come down
[1:23:56] you don't know like i know
[1:24:01] but jesus said
[1:24:03] jesus said
[1:24:04] in john 14 and 26
[1:24:07] that the comforter which is the holy
[1:24:08] ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:24:10] name he shall teach you all things and
[1:24:13] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:24:16] whatsoever i have said unto you
[1:24:18] so
[1:24:19] literally the spirit of the living god
[1:24:21] is going to inspire you to remember
[1:24:24] every word that jesus told us
[1:24:28] he said i give you power to walk on
[1:24:31] serpents i give you power in my name to
[1:24:33] bind i give you power to lay hands on
[1:24:36] the sick and they shall
[1:24:38] i give you power whosoever sends you
[1:24:41] remain on earth shall be remitted in
[1:24:43] heaven and how do we remit them we remit
[1:24:45] them by remission of sins in the baptism
[1:24:49] of the water tank
[1:24:52] repent every one of you
[1:24:54] and be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:24:56] jesus christ for the remissions
[1:24:59] of your sins
[1:25:03] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:25:05] holy ghost
[1:25:07] if you can remember to repent
[1:25:10] you can remember that you'll be filled
[1:25:16] but some of you don't forgot how to
[1:25:17] repent
[1:25:20] so you forgot how to be filled
[1:25:22] but oh it's a simple it's a simple
[1:25:24] prescription
[1:25:26] he said i'm the lord thy god that heals
[1:25:29] all of thy diseases
[1:25:31] i'm the lord thy god that heals oh
[1:25:33] i forgive all of your iniquities
[1:25:38] i find it amazing when david is writing
[1:25:39] out this psalm
[1:25:41] he places both of them in the same
[1:25:42] scripture
[1:25:44] and the greek word salvation means so so
[1:25:46] it's both healing and it's both
[1:25:47] salvation
[1:25:50] the same atonement that paid for you is
[1:25:52] the same atonement that heals you
[1:25:56] are you with me repent
[1:26:00] i know it's hard
[1:26:01] you don't want to turn away from your
[1:26:02] ways you don't want to turn away from
[1:26:04] from your wicked ways but the bible said
[1:26:07] seek ye the lord
[1:26:08] while he may be found
[1:26:10] call upon him while he is near he said
[1:26:13] let the wicked forsake his way isaiah 55
[1:26:17] and 7 and the unrighteous man his
[1:26:19] thoughts and let him return
[1:26:22] unto the lord
[1:26:27] and he
[1:26:31] you don't know what i've done you don't
[1:26:32] know the stack up against me and he will
[1:26:36] have mercy
[1:26:37] upon him and to our god for he will
[1:26:41] abundantly
[1:26:43] abundantly pardon
[1:26:48] thank you
[1:26:51] if he don't remember it
[1:26:55] if he don't remember what i did
[1:26:58] if he don't remember what you did if he
[1:27:01] don't remember the hell hole that you
[1:27:02] were in if you don't remember the hog
[1:27:04] pin that you were in then why should i
[1:27:06] spend my time remembering it
[1:27:13] brother andrew
[1:27:14] you don't know what this person did let
[1:27:16] me tell you bring that under out
[1:27:18] underneath the blood it's on you

[1:27:31] you but i just want you to go for a
[1:27:33] reference that david was there that

[1:27:50] philistines had surrounded him on this
[1:27:52] side and saul had surrounded him on this
[1:27:55] side and the bible goes on to say that
[1:27:57] the philistines had garrisoned
[1:27:59] themselves about bethlehem
[1:28:01] and david
[1:28:04] david was there in his worst times
[1:28:08] in a cave

[1:29:03] pill or fire that's coming
[1:29:07] darkness on one side lines on another
[1:29:10] but a pillar of fire watching over his
[1:29:12] prophet
[1:29:13] because daniel had purpled himself in
[1:29:15] his heart that he would not defile
[1:29:18] himself with the king's meat
[1:29:23] trouble's on this side trouble's on that
[1:29:25] side self on this side pride on that
[1:29:28] side

[1:29:33] somebody that still believed that david
[1:29:35] was going to be king it was right in the
[1:29:38] midst of harvest time when david stroke

[1:29:45] the water of the wells of bethlehem
[1:29:47] that's by the gate

[1:29:53] the day that david david desired
[1:29:57] this water
[1:29:58] and here we are in harvest time
[1:30:01] and if there ever
[1:30:02] wasn't time to water king jesus

[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:10] those mighty men
[1:30:12] everything that that saul was trying to

[1:31:37] messiah we thought this was going to be
[1:31:39] the king of judah and the king of israel
[1:31:43] there he is
[1:31:45] in a cave
[1:31:50] oh and you thought kingdom life
[1:31:54] kingdom life was all that great
[1:31:57] it's about setting up in a palace and
[1:32:00] having all the fine robes
[1:32:02] and all the beautiful ladies fanning you
[1:32:04] with palm trees and somebody dropping in
[1:32:06] grape juice
[1:32:07] and grapes and crackers and cheese
[1:32:12] maybe you would like a little cheese for
[1:32:14] your wine

[1:32:37] they're putting your cross
[1:32:43] your cross
[1:32:44] for what you should have been bearing
[1:32:47] they were putting it on the king of
[1:32:48] kings and the lord of lords
[1:32:51] are you sure you want to walk this
[1:32:53] kingdom life
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:59] but blessed is he
[1:33:03] blessed is he
[1:33:06] well i said is he
[1:33:10] who his reproach for my name
[1:33:14] oh i remember
[1:33:16] i remember
[1:33:18] it should have been me
[1:33:20] i should have been in that cave i should
[1:33:22] have been under that cross i should have
[1:33:24] been under that load but i remember
[1:33:26] there was somebody that was willing
[1:33:28] to take my spot
[1:33:33] there was some men that still believed
[1:33:36] that david was going to be king
[1:33:41] and he said that they that brother
[1:33:43] branham said there and why little
[1:33:45] bethlehem he said that's the warriors of
[1:33:47] god like was with david they had their
[1:33:50] hands on their sword walking at his arm
[1:33:53] he said that's the way god's warriors
[1:33:55] walk
[1:33:56] ready
[1:33:59] they're not setting they're unprepared
[1:34:01] they're not setting their complacent
[1:34:03] they're not sitting there mentally
[1:34:05] disposed but you have joined yourself
[1:34:07] with a band of army men that are
[1:34:09] equipped and ready to witness of the
[1:34:12] holy ghost
[1:34:13] i say this that devils tremble when sons
[1:34:16] of god have confidence in their sword
[1:34:19] that this demon of cancer that's raising
[1:34:21] its ugly head is begging that these sons
[1:34:24] of god
[1:34:25] put back their sword
[1:34:28] put back their sword and their sheath
[1:34:30] but i'm going to steal the devil it's
[1:34:32] too late my sword is uncheated
[1:34:36] i'm ready to fight whether you put him
[1:34:38] in a cave whether you put him on a cross
[1:34:47] you got a few more minutes
[1:34:50] he said the enemy says
[1:34:51] you have to take a little drink to be
[1:34:53] sociable
[1:34:56] but the warrior says i'll not touch your
[1:34:58] unclean thing
[1:34:59] he said oh why don't you renounce that
[1:35:01] old holy roller stuff you believe
[1:35:03] and a warrior says i believe god and
[1:35:05] i'll stand true
[1:35:07] oh
[1:35:08] there's no such thing as divine healing
[1:35:10] the warrior says that's what you think
[1:35:13] because i know better there's no such a
[1:35:15] thing as a baptism of the holy ghost
[1:35:17] them days has passed on that's what you
[1:35:19] think i've already received it it's just
[1:35:22] for you it's just too late for you to
[1:35:24] tell me anything about it
[1:35:28] here david he was letting his memory go
[1:35:30] to work
[1:35:33] it's something powerful about your
[1:35:35] memory i know that the devil wants to
[1:35:36] get in your memory
[1:35:38] i know he wants to get in there and try
[1:35:39] to rip it apart and play all the
[1:35:41] emotional parts on your memory of how
[1:35:43] you remember things happened you can ask
[1:35:44] one person one thing and ask another
[1:35:46] person a different thing it's all on how
[1:35:48] they remembered it
[1:35:51] but david david was setting up there in
[1:35:55] this cave and he was letting his memory
[1:35:57] take a hold of him he said oh i remember
[1:36:00] them old days back there i remember i
[1:36:02] remember how that that was my land i was
[1:36:05] born for that land my grandmother when
[1:36:08] when she was born when she bore judah
[1:36:12] when she bore judah and that's the
[1:36:14] lineage that i'm out of when she was
[1:36:16] bearing judah it was placing me in my
[1:36:18] position in the land
[1:36:20] he said i can remember that's the land
[1:36:22] of my grandfather that's the land of my
[1:36:24] father's that's the land of my
[1:36:25] grandmother
[1:36:27] and there
[1:36:29] the philistines is garrison around my
[1:36:31] hometown
[1:36:32] i remember that's where i was a sheep
[1:36:34] herder i remember that's where i was
[1:36:36] anointed i remember when samuel came by
[1:36:38] my way i remember what it was like there
[1:36:41] was a good old days
[1:36:44] what was this doing what was his memory
[1:36:46] doing it was taking him back to
[1:36:48] bethlehem
[1:36:49] why don't you let your memory take you
[1:36:51] back to the house of god's bread
[1:36:53] that he'll feed you that man should not
[1:36:56] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:36:58] that proceeds out of the mouth of god
[1:37:00] why don't you let your memory go back to
[1:37:02] them good old days ephesians
[1:37:07] why have you lost and left your first
[1:37:10] love
[1:37:11] you remember what it was like to be
[1:37:12] saved
[1:37:15] you remember what it was like to feel
[1:37:16] the holy ghost coming to you you
[1:37:18] remember what it was like to feel the
[1:37:20] spirit of the living god sweeping over
[1:37:22] your soul
[1:37:26] why don't you come back to your first
[1:37:28] love
[1:37:29] why don't you come back out of your
[1:37:31] backslidden condition and repent
[1:37:34] remember
[1:37:35] remember what it was like remember how
[1:37:38] he called you
[1:37:48] he said it'd been better
[1:37:50] if the church world looked back to their
[1:37:51] good old days when they're few and far
[1:37:54] between the little schoolhouses out
[1:37:56] there in america falling under the power
[1:37:57] of god throwing water out in their face
[1:38:00] it'd be better if you baptists look back
[1:38:01] to where you came from and the rest of
[1:38:03] them you pentecostals look back to where
[1:38:05] you came from that's right
[1:38:08] that's right
[1:38:09] but notice what brother adam said he
[1:38:11] said
[1:38:12] in the heat of the battle
[1:38:17] not when everything was going good
[1:38:19] but in the heat of it
[1:38:22] david began to think
[1:38:26] what did what did paul tell us
[1:38:28] whatsoever things are pure
[1:38:30] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[1:38:32] things are righteous think on these
[1:38:35] things
[1:38:37] you're gonna have some trials you're
[1:38:39] gonna have some days when people talk
[1:38:40] about you but think on these things he
[1:38:44] said oh i can remember them nights i
[1:38:47] laid out yonder on the hillside i
[1:38:49] remember when i watched them stars how
[1:38:51] they moved up yonder how god talked to
[1:38:54] my little boy heart he said i can
[1:38:56] remember when i got in the spirit one
[1:38:57] day looking at the clouds and the shady
[1:39:00] green pastures till i screamed out in
[1:39:02] the spirit and saying the lord
[1:39:04] is my shepherd and i shall not want and
[1:39:07] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:39:09] the shadow's death i will fear no evil
[1:39:12] for thou art with me
[1:39:19] here david
[1:39:21] could sit there and say i remember
[1:39:23] i remember when a lion came in and
[1:39:25] snatched one of my sheep i remember
[1:39:28] i remember the same day i got that sheep
[1:39:30] back in there came a bear coming after
[1:39:32] the sheepfold
[1:39:35] and i took this stone
[1:39:37] and i took this sling
[1:39:38] i remember i remember going after that
[1:39:41] sheep i remember getting him back
[1:39:46] i remember
[1:39:47] i remember when there were some people
[1:39:49] that was telling me i was too young i
[1:39:51] remember when people was telling me that
[1:39:52] i was too ruddy i remember when my
[1:39:54] brother said he only come out here to
[1:39:56] look on the fight i remember when saul
[1:39:59] tried to put his ecclesiastical vest on
[1:40:01] me
[1:40:02] but i remember walking down into a
[1:40:04] valley unafraid
[1:40:07] i remember walking down in there and
[1:40:09] looking on that big giant i remember
[1:40:11] walking down in there and said this
[1:40:13] ain't nothing for the battle of the lord
[1:40:14] i remember grabbing those five stones
[1:40:17] and just like brother branham said he
[1:40:20] picked up jesus on his way to the fight
[1:40:22] i remember picking up jesus i remember
[1:40:25] picking up faith

[1:40:51] remember taking my sling and taking my
[1:40:53] stone
[1:40:56] and hitting him right between the eyes

[1:41:01] sword
[1:41:02] and cutting his head off
[1:41:13] i remember singing praises i remember
[1:41:15] walking through the streets and
[1:41:18] everybody's screaming david has kept
[1:41:20] saul has killed his thousand but david
[1:41:22] is tens of thousands i remember how it
[1:41:25] routed the enemy and it gave a charge to
[1:41:28] the children of israel
[1:41:29] i remember

[1:41:41] among the people sing unto him sing
[1:41:44] songs unto him talk to you of all of his
[1:41:46] wonderful works

[1:41:54] ye in his holy name
[1:41:57] let the heart of them rejoice
[1:41:59] that seek the lord seek the lord and his

[1:42:16] remembered
[1:42:20] the things that he's done he's made them
[1:42:22] to be remembered
[1:42:25] the lord is gracious and full of
[1:42:28] compassion
[1:42:29] psalms 103 bless the lord o my soul and
[1:42:33] forget not all of his benefits who
[1:42:36] forgiveth all thy iniquities who healeth
[1:42:38] all of thy diseases who redeems thy life
[1:42:41] from destruction who crown of thee with
[1:42:43] loving kindness and tender mercies
[1:42:46] who satisfy thy mouth with good things
[1:42:48] so that thy youth is renewed like the
[1:42:51] eagles

[1:44:06] i remember when he started talking to us
[1:44:08] yeah he talked some crazy stuff to us at

[1:46:45] when the man of god prayed a little girl
[1:46:47] with club feet got up out of that
[1:46:49] wheelchair
[1:46:50] and started running all over that tent

[1:46:58] of a sudden we come through a prayer
[1:47:00] line and he struggled all weekend long
[1:47:03] but when he come in that prayer line the

[1:48:00] weekend he was playing volleyball like a
[1:48:02] teenager and it never bothered him one
[1:48:04] time
[1:48:05] i remember telling you to stop that
[1:48:07] devil's sugar diabetes and jim noel that

[1:49:08] it wasn't 15 years ago
[1:49:11] it was 2 000 years ago
[1:49:14] and what satan thought that he'd rob
[1:49:16] from me
[1:49:18] he'd already paid for
[1:49:27] david said i will never forget thy
[1:49:29] precepts
[1:49:31] for with them thou hast
[1:49:33] quickened me
[1:49:45] if we could just go to remember
[1:49:51] that all of his promises are yes and
[1:49:53] amen
[1:49:56] if we can just let our mind loose
[1:50:01] to the fact

[1:50:38] i remember
[1:50:40] feeling that fire
[1:50:42] running over my body
[1:50:45] but i'll let sin come in

[1:50:50] destroy the man that i was meant to be
[1:50:54] i let sin and complexes and stigmas
[1:50:59] erode away my life

[1:52:02] for your healing i want you to remember
[1:52:04] what you're going through
[1:52:06] that there's nothing that has happened
[1:52:07] to you that god has not already seen

[1:52:16] good to them that love god to them who
[1:52:18] are be called according to his purpose
[1:52:22] but you say but i remember what i was

[1:52:31] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:52:34] after the spirit and if the same spirit
[1:52:37] that dwells in christ dwells in you it

[1:52:54] don't you remember that i can do all
[1:52:56] things through christ who strengthens me
[1:52:59] why don't you remember that he paid the
[1:53:02] ultimate sacrifice
[1:53:04] so that you could go free
[1:53:07] [Applause]
[1:53:10] oh
[1:53:11] hallelujah
[1:53:13] this ain't as high as you'll go
[1:53:15] it might be men around you that this is
[1:53:18] as they'll go but church of the living
[1:53:20] god you were born to go higher

[1:56:33] i remember a man of tenacity that they
[1:56:36] thought they was going to turn around
[1:56:40] but this was a bible man
[1:56:43] filled with a bible god
[1:56:47] i remember when they told me
[1:56:50] oh you used to dance a whole lot more
[1:56:52] when he's out in the world than when you
[1:56:54] dance right now
[1:56:56] but i remember when i stood right in
[1:56:58] front of them my shells
[1:57:01] and made fun of the way that we worship
[1:57:03] and i said if you don't like that watch
[1:57:05] this
[1:57:06] and i dance right in front of them

[1:57:13] gospel lighthouse and said oh we'll shut
[1:57:15] them down we'll walk away from this
[1:57:17] church but i remember when there was
[1:57:19] somebody when somebody walked away but i
[1:57:22] remember when somebody said i stand for
[1:57:24] jesus
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:30] i remember they said they shut us down i
[1:57:33] remember but i remember what jesus said
[1:57:36] i started my church the way i wanted it
[1:57:38] and i'm gonna finish my church the way i
[1:57:40] started it
[1:57:44] that's for me and my house we're gonna
[1:57:47] serve the lord
[1:57:50] because you don't know like i know
[1:57:56] what he done for me
[1:58:00] cause you don't know like i know
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:15] remember me devil
[1:58:19] let the musicians come
[1:58:21] give him praise in the house of god
[1:58:38] i'm gonna close with this words
[1:58:49] satan
[1:58:50] has done everything to stop you
[1:58:55] and god don't
[1:58:57] take it lightly
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:01] when his enemy tries to stop
[1:59:03] what god's already ordained
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:11] you see you were ordained to go into a
[1:59:13] promised land
[1:59:14] just like the children of israel were
[1:59:16] ordained to go into a promised land
[1:59:19] but notice
[1:59:21] sometimes when you're going through
[1:59:22] deuteronomy 25 i want you to go back
[1:59:24] there
[1:59:25] and take a look what god says remember
[1:59:28] he said remember amalek
[1:59:30] how that he tried to keep you out of the
