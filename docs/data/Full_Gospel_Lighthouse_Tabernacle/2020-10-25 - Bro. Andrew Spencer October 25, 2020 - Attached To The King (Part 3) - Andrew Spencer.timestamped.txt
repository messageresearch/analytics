[0:21] i was talking to him to an old saint
[0:24] he said brother brandon i know you
[0:26] believe in the supernatural and i said
[0:28] certainly my brother
[0:30] he said years ago i used to think i was
[0:33] somebody
[0:34] so i thought i was really a christian
[0:36] and he said then up in our church i had
[0:38] to climb the hill
[0:39] where i stopped my little car and said i
[0:41] had to climb a hill about
[0:42] oh three or four hundred yards to get
[0:44] around with bushes and things getting up
[0:46] and said we'd have prayer meeting up
[0:47] there and said
[0:49] i thought i was really a christian he
[0:52] said i know
[0:52] all the bible i studied all the hebrew i
[0:55] studied all the
[0:56] right pronunciations of the words and
[0:58] said anybody walk up to me i could talk
[0:59] to him like that about the bible
[1:01] i know what i was talking about he said
[1:04] one night i was going up to church
[1:06] there'd been a lot of conflict in our
[1:08] church said this little
[1:09] party's against one another you know i
[1:11] raised i said yes sir he said oh my road
[1:13] up the hill i was walking
[1:14] and all at once i become conscious
[1:18] that somebody was following me
[1:21] and said i thought i weakness a little
[1:23] bit forever it was to catch up not talk
[1:25] to him a little while
[1:26] as we went up the road you know
[1:30] that's kind of a good thing you just
[1:32] wait a little while
[1:34] it says as i walked up the hill and i
[1:38] come up a man came up the hill and said
[1:41] he had a bundle on his back
[1:42] that was way bigger than a man and said
[1:45] he was just a
[1:46] painting and a blowing hand making his
[1:48] little short steps trying to get up
[1:50] and i said fella can i help you pack
[1:53] this load up hill he said no
[1:55] i got a packet so i looked at his hand
[1:59] so i knew that it was a vision he had
[2:02] scars in his hand
[2:04] so i fell down and i said lord are you
[2:06] packing the sins of the world in that
[2:08] cycle so no i'm just packing yours
[2:10] just getting you up the hill just so you
[2:13] can get it

[51:18] one in word
[51:22] name we pray amen amen
[51:26] we have your bibles this morning let's
[51:27] turn over to the book of first john
[51:29] chapter four and verse one
[51:34] praise the lord everybody
[51:37] i'd like to speak to you again on attach
[51:39] to the king
[51:52] now satan has done his absolute worst to
[51:55] keep us
[51:56] from being attached to this king
[52:00] but we didn't start this
[52:03] so we can't finish it he didn't start it
[52:07] so he can't finish it
[52:09] but our lord jesus started this
[52:11] attachment
[52:13] and he is the one that will finish it
[52:15] and accomplish his work
[52:17] first john 4 and 1 beloved believe not
[52:20] every spirit but try the spirits
[52:23] whether they are of god because many
[52:25] false prophets are going out into the
[52:27] world
[52:28] hereby know you the spirit of god every
[52:31] spirit that confesses
[52:33] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[52:36] is of god and every spirit that
[52:39] confesseth not that jesus christ has
[52:41] come in the flesh
[52:42] is not of god and this is that spirit of
[52:45] antichrist whereof ye have heard that it
[52:48] should come
[52:49] even now already is it in the world
[52:53] year of god little children and have
[52:55] overcame them because
[52:56] greater is he that is in you than he
[52:59] that
[53:00] is in the world do you believe that this
[53:01] morning the greater
[53:03] is he that is in you than he that is in
[53:06] the world
[53:07] they are of the world therefore speak
[53:10] they of the world
[53:11] and the world heareth them we are of god
[53:14] and he that knoweth god heareth us and
[53:17] he that is not of god
[53:19] heareth not us hereby we know the spirit
[53:22] of truth
[53:23] and the spirit of error may god bless
[53:25] you you may be seated in the presence of
[53:27] the lord
[53:29] amen i read over this
[53:32] just a few days ago and i'd like to
[53:34] share it with you
[53:37] if there ever was a time now the bible
[53:40] says in no
[53:41] number 16-48 that he that he stood
[53:44] between those who had died and those who
[53:46] were still alive
[53:48] and the plague stopped now was the time
[53:51] for
[53:51] all good men to come to the aid of their
[53:54] country
[53:55] so wrote charles weller in 1867 as a
[53:58] simple exercise in warming up his
[54:00] fingers
[54:01] for using his new feigned angled
[54:03] invention called the typewriter
[54:06] little could he have known how
[54:08] perpetually relevant
[54:09] his spontaneous and unadorned sentence
[54:12] would be
[54:12] through the decades if ever there was a
[54:15] time
[54:16] for we who profess faith in christ who
[54:19] are by his own pronouncement the salt of
[54:22] the earth the light of the world a city
[54:24] set on the hill
[54:25] it is now if there ever was a time to
[54:28] let our light so
[54:29] shine before men that they might see our
[54:31] good works
[54:32] and glorify our father in heaven it is
[54:35] now
[54:36] if there ever was a time to do all
[54:38] things without murmuring and disputing
[54:41] so that we might be blameless harmless
[54:43] or sons of god without rebuke in the
[54:45] midst of a wicked
[54:47] and perverse generation it is now
[54:50] if there ever was a time for the
[54:51] redeemed of the lord to do
[54:53] to say so it is now if there ever was a
[54:56] time to stir up the gift that is in us
[54:59] no longer ashamed of the testimony of
[55:01] our lord
[55:02] nor drawing back for fear of rejection
[55:04] and ridicule
[55:06] it is now if there ever was a time to
[55:08] hold fast the prophet
[55:10] the the pattern of sound words standing
[55:13] in the grace of christ and enduring
[55:15] hardship
[55:16] as a good soldier it is now if there
[55:19] ever was a time
[55:20] to shun profane and vain babblings to
[55:22] flee the youthful lust
[55:24] it is now and if there ever was a time
[55:27] for diligence in presenting our case for
[55:29] christ with dignity
[55:31] it is now if there ever was a time for
[55:33] private piety to become a public virtue
[55:36] it is now now is the time for all good
[55:39] men and women all
[55:41] good boys and girls to come to the
[55:43] forefront of faith
[55:45] and show the power of christ's gospel
[55:47] through lives
[55:48] marked with love and faithfulness will
[55:51] you be among those who stand up in this
[55:53] day
[55:54] when so many bow down to lesser gods
[55:58] will you show up speak up pray up
[56:02] stay up step up so these in your sphere
[56:06] of influence
[56:07] can hear see know and understand
[56:10] and believe that jesus christ is the son
[56:14] of the living god if there ever was a
[56:17] time
[56:19] it is now if there ever was a time for
[56:22] the bride to shine
[56:23] it is now if there ever was a time for
[56:26] miracles it's now
[56:28] if there ever was a time for healings
[56:30] it's now
[56:31] if there ever was a time to be refilled
[56:34] with the holy ghost
[56:35] it is now if there ever was a time if
[56:38] you've been going through life and
[56:39] you've been holding out a little bit
[56:41] now's the time not to hold back right
[56:44] now
[56:44] in the world of sports there is a there
[56:46] is a series that is going on it's called
[56:49] the world series
[56:50] and they're playing a game of seven the
[56:52] best of seven games and right now
[56:54] they're in a deadlock and they're
[56:56] looking to see
[56:57] who's the best in the world in the mlb
[57:00] and what they're doing now they may have
[57:02] held back some things in the first two
[57:04] games or the third game
[57:06] but in the oncoming games they've got to
[57:08] play out every game to find out who's
[57:10] the best in the world
[57:12] now that's how they set up how they're
[57:14] going to find out who's the best in the
[57:15] world
[57:16] but they are no longer holding back if
[57:18] they were holding back a good picture
[57:20] they're no longer holding him back no
[57:22] more if they're holding back or if
[57:24] they're holding back a certain batter
[57:26] they're no longer holding him back no
[57:28] more
[57:28] they're letting him loose because this
[57:30] is the time for them
[57:32] and if there ever was a time for you to
[57:35] show up in this hour it's now the time
[57:38] if there ever was a time for you as sons
[57:41] and daughters of god to show
[57:43] on what side you're attached to whether
[57:45] you're attached to the king of chaos
[57:47] or you're attached to the king of peace
[57:49] it's now the time for you to show up
[57:52] you can sit back there and you can think
[57:54] well i'm all alone and
[57:55] i don't see nobody else i don't go out
[57:57] but once a week
[57:58] what's it gonna matter what the world
[58:00] sees of me i
[58:02] only go out to church one time a week i
[58:04] go to the grocery store
[58:05] one time a week there is a king that's
[58:08] got his eye on his children
[58:10] and see where that attachment's at and
[58:13] he sees when you're standing
[58:14] he sees when you're sitting he knows
[58:17] what side you're taking on
[58:20] you ain't gotta cast your vote at a
[58:22] ballot box
[58:23] jesus knows what side you're on
[58:26] jesus knows what you're going through
[58:29] jesus
[58:30] understands hallelujah
[58:33] the bible says in romans 8 and 5 for
[58:36] they
[58:36] that are of the flesh do mind the things
[58:38] of the flesh
[58:40] but they that are after the spirit the
[58:42] things of the spirit
[58:44] for to be carnally minded is death but
[58:46] to be spiritually minded is life and
[58:48] peace
[58:49] because the carnal mind is enmity
[58:51] against god
[58:52] for it is not subject to the law of god
[58:54] neither indeed can be
[58:56] so then they that are in the flesh
[58:58] cannot please god
[59:00] is that right but ye are not in the
[59:03] flesh
[59:05] look at your neighbor say i see you but
[59:07] ye are not in the flesh
[59:09] but in the spirit if so be that the
[59:12] spirit of god
[59:13] dwell in you now if any man have not the
[59:16] spirit of christ he
[59:18] is none of his and if christ be in you
[59:21] hallelujah the body is dead because of
[59:24] sin but the spirit is life because of
[59:26] righteousness
[59:27] but if the spirit of him
[59:32] if the spirit of him that raised up
[59:35] jesus from the dead
[59:37] dwell in you he that raised up christ
[59:40] from the dead
[59:41] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[59:45] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[59:48] if there's anything that happens here
[59:50] today it's because the spirit of him
[59:52] if there's healings that happen here
[59:54] today it's because the spirit of him
[59:57] if there's deliverance that happens here
[59:59] today it's because the spirit of him
[1:00:02] are you with me if you get a body change
[1:00:05] today
[1:00:05] it's because the spirit of him if you
[1:00:08] start seeing your loved one sister
[1:00:10] charlie
[1:00:11] you start seeing your daddy walk down
[1:00:13] the street it's because the spirit
[1:00:16] of him if you are seen as an overcomer
[1:00:20] of laodicea
[1:00:21] it's because the spirit of him
[1:00:25] whoo somebody give the lord a hand
[1:00:27] clapper praise
[1:00:29] hey amen
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:36] amen amen amen
[1:00:41] i remember one time a story of a little
[1:00:44] cockney in england he was just an
[1:00:46] ordinary man
[1:00:47] and they said that the king one of the
[1:00:49] kings in the early days was going into
[1:00:51] his palace
[1:00:52] and this he had no one he had a message
[1:00:55] that he had to get forth an
[1:00:56] urgent message because of the enemy and
[1:00:59] so he had
[1:01:00] said to this little fella standing there
[1:01:01] he said here take this
[1:01:03] message take this message and hurry to a
[1:01:06] certain place and
[1:01:08] command this to be done and he said here
[1:01:10] take my scepter in your hand
[1:01:12] that'll vindicate you you're sent from
[1:01:16] me
[1:01:16] and he stuck it under his robe and he
[1:01:18] went and the guards everywhere stopping
[1:01:21] him and everybody else yelling get away
[1:01:23] i have a message of the king i'm the
[1:01:26] king's messenger a vindicated word
[1:01:28] and i thought satan get out of my way i
[1:01:32] have the king's message
[1:01:34] and i must go and one time when they
[1:01:37] killed the prince of peace and put him
[1:01:39] in the grave
[1:01:40] and sealed up the tomb and death held
[1:01:42] him for three days and nights
[1:01:44] but on easter morning he had that
[1:01:46] scepter in his hand and he hollered
[1:01:48] get away death get away grave open up
[1:01:52] i am the king's message i must come
[1:01:55] forth to prove this resurrection
[1:01:57] i am the resurrection and i
[1:02:00] am the life hallelujah if that don't
[1:02:03] make you feel good i don't know what
[1:02:05] will
[1:02:06] but if you are a part of him
[1:02:10] and the spirit of him dwells in you you
[1:02:13] are packing the king's message and that
[1:02:16] word that is in your mouth
[1:02:18] is the king's word and where the word of
[1:02:21] a king is there is
[1:02:23] power this is not your message this
[1:02:26] is the king's message and the king's
[1:02:28] message will vindicate you
[1:02:30] you can take this message you can run
[1:02:33] with this message
[1:02:34] you can live with this message you can
[1:02:36] live by this message
[1:02:38] you can die by this message
[1:02:41] you can separate from me and you can
[1:02:44] separate from your pastor
[1:02:46] but if you separate from this message
[1:02:48] you have separated yourself
[1:02:51] from the king of life you can walk away
[1:02:54] from me
[1:02:55] you can walk away from my friends you
[1:02:57] can walk away from this ministry
[1:02:59] but you walk away from this message you
[1:03:02] have
[1:03:03] walked away from eternal life
[1:03:06] i know that there's some people that
[1:03:07] don't like that kind of thinking
[1:03:09] but without this message there is
[1:03:12] no rapture
[1:03:16] this message will put you into a body
[1:03:19] change
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:23] you remember that story brother bannon
[1:03:24] would tell about that chief engineer
[1:03:26] that that
[1:03:27] that that man was having trouble with
[1:03:29] his car and he took it into a little
[1:03:30] mechanic
[1:03:31] he took it in there and that mechanic
[1:03:33] tried putting it on every different test
[1:03:35] he put it on a generator he put plugs in
[1:03:38] he did everything just to see if he
[1:03:39] could get that car going you remember
[1:03:41] the story
[1:03:42] he tried his very best but then there
[1:03:44] came in a fine dress man
[1:03:46] and he told him he said sir why don't
[1:03:48] you try to doing this
[1:03:49] and the mechanic turned around to him
[1:03:52] and he said
[1:03:52] who are you he said i'm the chief
[1:03:55] engineer
[1:03:56] i'm the one that designed it i'm the one
[1:03:59] that designed it you see he knew that it
[1:04:02] would work
[1:04:02] because he had designed it that way
[1:04:06] oh hallelujah brother branham said our
[1:04:08] there was a well-dressed man one day
[1:04:11] that knew who this body was he designed
[1:04:14] it in such a way
[1:04:17] that he knows it's going to work he
[1:04:19] knows what it takes to make you rapture
[1:04:21] ready
[1:04:22] he's well dressed in his promises he's
[1:04:24] well dressed in resurrection

[1:05:13] satan loves hearing that from you why
[1:05:15] don't you tell him
[1:05:17] satan you can't stop us
[1:05:23] hallelujah brother nathan when you go
[1:05:26] out
[1:05:26] you could go and maybe tell your
[1:05:28] football team and say hey
[1:05:30] the other teams they're gonna they're
[1:05:32] gonna battle against us but they can't
[1:05:34] stop us
[1:05:35] now they might look you in the natural
[1:05:37] and you think they'll think man
[1:05:39] we have a losing record i don't know
[1:05:41] what the record will be this coming
[1:05:42] spring whatever you play
[1:05:44] but you could say they could say well
[1:05:45] we've got a losing record but you could
[1:05:47] say i'm not talking about this team
[1:05:49] i'm talking about team jesus that ain't
[1:05:52] never lost to battle
[1:05:53] he's never lost and he don't know what
[1:05:55] the word defeat is
[1:05:58] jesus now now now jesus told us in john
[1:06:02] 14 and 12 and we're very familiar
[1:06:04] with this scripture that he that
[1:06:05] believeth on me the works that i do
[1:06:07] shall he do also in greater works than
[1:06:09] these shall he do
[1:06:10] because i go into my father but i want
[1:06:13] to read this to you from the passion
[1:06:15] translation just to give you a view of
[1:06:17] it
[1:06:17] it says i tell you this timeless truth
[1:06:20] that the person who follows me in faith
[1:06:23] believing in me will do the same mighty
[1:06:26] miracles
[1:06:27] that i do even greater miracles than
[1:06:31] miracles
[1:06:32] than these because i go to be
[1:06:36] with my father that the person that
[1:06:39] follows me
[1:06:40] in faith will do the same mighty
[1:06:43] miracles that i do
[1:06:46] in your community you will do great
[1:06:48] miracles
[1:06:50] are you with me you're going to do some
[1:06:53] spectacular things
[1:06:55] there is a vision of you in this hour
[1:06:58] where you are going to take a body
[1:07:01] change
[1:07:04] now jesus said you do as i do
[1:07:08] and the most incredible part about that
[1:07:10] command
[1:07:11] is that it comes with an a with a power
[1:07:14] and an authority to live it out
[1:07:16] jesus doesn't just say to you and that
[1:07:19] you can
[1:07:20] just he doesn't ask you just to try to
[1:07:22] live like the son out of your own
[1:07:24] strength
[1:07:25] but his resurrection gave you an access
[1:07:28] to his strength
[1:07:30] he gave you an access to his strength
[1:07:33] and if you have had a pentecostal
[1:07:35] experience
[1:07:36] where you have died out to yourself
[1:07:40] and you have been birthed into the
[1:07:42] kingdom of god
[1:07:43] you see the holy ghost is more than a
[1:07:46] thought
[1:07:47] the holy ghost is more than something
[1:07:49] well i believe he's here and he's
[1:07:51] floating around this room
[1:07:53] i believe that he's able to maybe come
[1:07:55] and and fill me up like a tea jar
[1:07:58] pouring into my glass of sweet tea god
[1:08:01] is more than a thought he's a reality
[1:08:06] he's alive he's alive he
[1:08:09] is is still hebrews 13 and 8.
[1:08:13] it isn't just trained in our mind that
[1:08:15] god's the same
[1:08:16] he's the same he's a reality
[1:08:20] and we're not sitting here this morning
[1:08:22] i'm not trying to work you up or trying
[1:08:24] to keep some kind of momentum going
[1:08:26] you see we're not like a bunch of
[1:08:27] pentecostals that are sitting by a
[1:08:29] painted fire
[1:08:30] trying to work up a revival of 1906 that
[1:08:33] happened on azusa street
[1:08:35] no we're not doing that we're setting
[1:08:38] here where the real fire
[1:08:39] is we're not sitting by some painted
[1:08:42] fire
[1:08:43] like like somebody that's sitting there
[1:08:45] trying to get warm
[1:08:46] i know there's a fire here
[1:08:49] well how do you know brother angel he
[1:08:52] said it in his word
[1:08:53] that where you are i will be there it's
[1:08:56] who i gathered in my name i'll be there
[1:08:58] that tells me there's a fire here this
[1:09:00] morning
[1:09:03] and satan has done his worst to try to
[1:09:06] put that fire out
[1:09:08] but he can't stop it you remember i told
[1:09:11] you about that roll over fire
[1:09:13] that when a firefighter goes into a room
[1:09:16] they're looking
[1:09:16] they're looking at all types of
[1:09:18] different fire how that they're moving
[1:09:19] through a room
[1:09:20] and they're watching that fire and they
[1:09:22] call one type of fire roll over fire
[1:09:25] and they're watching that if that fire
[1:09:27] is rolling across that ceiling there
[1:09:30] that they know they've got to cool that
[1:09:32] room down in the next room
[1:09:34] so that they that that fire doesn't roll
[1:09:36] over to the next room
[1:09:39] that's what satan is trying to do is
[1:09:41] trying to cool you down with
[1:09:42] lukewarmness
[1:09:43] of laodicea and try to cool your
[1:09:45] experience down
[1:09:47] i'll throw covet on them they won't be
[1:09:49] able to come to church like they used to
[1:09:51] i'll cool them off how many is here
[1:09:54] today
[1:09:56] [Music]
[1:09:58] how many is here today you did not stop
[1:10:01] the fire
[1:10:02] from getting us to church this morning
[1:10:06] he's going to try to stop it this coming
[1:10:08] week but
[1:10:10] it is a rollover fire that cannot be
[1:10:13] put out
[1:10:16] hallelujah this is a reality
[1:10:19] it's not a declaration of words this is
[1:10:22] the truth
[1:10:25] you see if you've just got the word
[1:10:26] that's all you got but when the token is
[1:10:28] applied
[1:10:30] then christ is a reality to you
[1:10:33] is that right how many is a witness that
[1:10:35] christ is a reality to you
[1:10:38] see god's not looking for some robots
[1:10:43] you spit out all kinds of quotes and all
[1:10:45] kinds of different things he's not
[1:10:46] looking for computers
[1:10:47] he's not looking for your iphone he's
[1:10:49] looking for human beings
[1:10:51] that's been redeemed by the blood of the
[1:10:53] lamb that's been called by his name
[1:10:56] been attached to his name that can
[1:10:58] produce the same life
[1:11:00] and produce the same living reality
[1:11:03] in this hour
[1:11:08] i was listening to the prophet this week
[1:11:10] and he said you know i heard him say he
[1:11:11] said
[1:11:12] he said there's all kinds of fine
[1:11:14] sisters out there in
[1:11:15] in the congregation he said he said but
[1:11:18] there's there's not but one
[1:11:19] mrs branham he said now i said i know
[1:11:22] that some of you you sisters out there
[1:11:24] he said
[1:11:25] you're you're a sister to somebody or a
[1:11:27] daughter to somebody you're a wife to
[1:11:29] somebody
[1:11:30] i said but there's one that i take home
[1:11:33] with me
[1:11:35] there's one that i take home with me you
[1:11:38] see
[1:11:38] and there's a lot of churches out there
[1:11:40] today there's a lot of people that
[1:11:43] there's a lot of fine churches in the
[1:11:44] world but there's only one business
[1:11:47] jesus christ
[1:11:48] that's bringing forth the real true born
[1:11:50] again creatures of god
[1:11:52] her name's not methodist her name's not
[1:11:54] baptist her name
[1:11:56] is jesus mistress jesus and she's
[1:11:59] bringing for
[1:12:00] people not members of the methodist
[1:12:02] church she's not bringing forth baptist
[1:12:04] church or
[1:12:05] presbyterian or catholic she's bringing
[1:12:08] forth them born again
[1:12:09] rooted and grounded in christ jesus
[1:12:13] there's nobody that can operate like his
[1:12:16] wife
[1:12:17] are you with me there's nobody that can
[1:12:19] operate it
[1:12:20] you can put her in the most insane
[1:12:23] conditions
[1:12:24] but she does it well
[1:12:27] are you with me there there are there
[1:12:29] are some sisters that have went
[1:12:31] had to go through some stages of life
[1:12:34] when they had to live in
[1:12:35] shacks they had to live in some very
[1:12:38] uh ugly spots of life that maybe they
[1:12:41] knew that that wasn't where they wanted
[1:12:43] to be at
[1:12:44] but the husband was doing the absolute
[1:12:46] best
[1:12:47] that he could and that husband watches
[1:12:50] that wife
[1:12:51] how she handles herself in that little
[1:12:53] shack and how she
[1:12:54] how she handles herself and she makes
[1:12:56] that shack a home
[1:12:58] and she does it real well she's
[1:13:01] operating a white as a wife no matter
[1:13:03] what the conditions are
[1:13:06] no matter how bad it looks around her
[1:13:09] there may be holes in the roof
[1:13:11] there might be holes in the windows
[1:13:13] there might be some shot out pains in
[1:13:15] the windows
[1:13:16] but she is doing the best that she can
[1:13:19] do
[1:13:20] with what she's been given i want to say
[1:13:22] to the bride of jesus christ
[1:13:24] here and around the world you are doing
[1:13:28] a very fine job leoducia has done
[1:13:32] its worst but the bride is
[1:13:35] right on time she's moving according to
[1:13:39] the promises of god
[1:13:42] it shows that there is a relationship
[1:13:45] between the bride and the groom
[1:13:50] you remember when brother branham was in
[1:13:52] the church age book he said notice that
[1:13:53] harmony
[1:13:54] that existed between the father and the
[1:13:56] son he said that harmony is now to exist
[1:13:59] between the bride and the bridegroom
[1:14:02] and i heard these words just kept
[1:14:04] resonating in my spirit this week
[1:14:06] that she receives that word she accepts
[1:14:09] that word she never doubts it
[1:14:13] she receives it she accepts it she never
[1:14:15] doubts it
[1:14:16] she receives it she never doubts
[1:14:20] i don't begin to think about the masses
[1:14:22] of people
[1:14:24] that heard this word
[1:14:28] they heard this word but many did not
[1:14:31] receive this word
[1:14:33] and because they did not receive this
[1:14:35] word they doubted this word
[1:14:38] but you are not a part of that group
[1:14:43] you are a part of a group that has heard
[1:14:46] this word
[1:14:47] you receive this word and you've never
[1:14:50] doubted this word
[1:14:52] and if you've never doubted this word it
[1:14:54] will take you
[1:14:55] places it will take you into a sphere
[1:15:01] when i hear a prophet saying who is this
[1:15:03] melchizedek
[1:15:04] that you bypassed your theophany to come
[1:15:07] down here on earth to be tempted by sin
[1:15:09] when i think about that theophany
[1:15:12] and i hear that song i don't just hear
[1:15:14] and think about sister craighead
[1:15:16] that wrote that song years ago i don't
[1:15:18] think about isaiah brooks and sister
[1:15:20] angela senior that sings that song i
[1:15:22] think about my
[1:15:24] theophany you can think about your
[1:15:27] theophany but i'm thinking about mine
[1:15:30] and i hear it calling me this
[1:15:33] is a message of a king
[1:15:36] who is this melchizedek
[1:15:40] who is this one that does and performs
[1:15:42] these great things
[1:15:44] when abraham was sitting there and he
[1:15:46] heard this voice he followed this voice
[1:15:48] he watched that voice how that
[1:15:50] everything that voice said everything
[1:15:52] came to pass
[1:15:53] and abraham lined himself up with that
[1:15:55] word
[1:15:57] you remember when he went down there and
[1:15:59] the king of salem cain the king of peace
[1:16:01] he came down there and he began to speak
[1:16:04] to him
[1:16:05] and he began to pay tithes to him are
[1:16:07] you with me this morning
[1:16:10] that abraham began to line himself up
[1:16:12] with the word of a king
[1:16:14] and one day there came three men walking
[1:16:17] down a dusty road
[1:16:19] had dirt on them had dirt on their shoes
[1:16:22] looked like a real king
[1:16:25] dressed in robes like all easterns would
[1:16:27] wear
[1:16:29] but there was something different and
[1:16:32] abraham had watched
[1:16:34] that there was something different sure
[1:16:36] the world is mixed up on how many lords
[1:16:38] there is but abraham knew
[1:16:40] that he when he looked at him he said my
[1:16:42] lord he knew that the one that he was
[1:16:45] looking at
[1:16:46] was the one that had made him a promise
[1:16:49] and even though sarah woke up bitter
[1:16:52] that morning
[1:16:54] she woke up upset that morning because
[1:16:57] mrs lot down there has all of the fine
[1:17:00] things of life
[1:17:02] and i don't have anything but this whole
[1:17:04] garb that i'm wearing
[1:17:05] and she woke up bitter she woke up upset
[1:17:11] as i heard i heard i heard a fine
[1:17:14] preacher say
[1:17:16] that abraham did what every smart
[1:17:18] husband did he went and said outside the
[1:17:20] tent
[1:17:22] [Laughter]
[1:17:24] brother adam listen
[1:17:28] but here sarah is upset
[1:17:32] bitter upset tore up everything else
[1:17:35] going on
[1:17:35] while i'm going through this and here
[1:17:39] comes and now cassidy sat at the tent
[1:17:43] abraham
[1:17:45] i am going to visit you according to the
[1:17:47] time of life
[1:17:49] you see there was a an issue of time
[1:17:52] there was a
[1:17:52] portion of time that was allotted for
[1:17:54] isaac to come forth
[1:17:57] and here sarah heard these words
[1:18:01] and she laughed in her heart hear me of
[1:18:04] being an old grandma
[1:18:06] how am i going to have pleasure with my
[1:18:09] lord in this state
[1:18:13] and notice the secrets of the heart
[1:18:14] begin to be revealed
[1:18:16] why did sarah laugh in her heart
[1:18:20] and sarah lied
[1:18:23] i didn't laugh
[1:18:28] you think about that there's some people
[1:18:31] that watch this
[1:18:32] i'll be i'm gonna i want to warn you
[1:18:34] don't laugh at this
[1:18:36] don't laugh at this one of these days
[1:18:39] you won't be laughing
[1:18:42] because the one that's sitting outside
[1:18:44] the tent
[1:18:45] has the ability to take away your
[1:18:47] bitterness has the ability to take away
[1:18:50] that old grumpy spirit that you've been
[1:18:52] dealing with
[1:18:54] the one on the outside of the tent has
[1:18:56] the ability
[1:18:57] to change you from a grandma to a
[1:18:59] teenager
[1:19:00] the one on the outside of the tent has
[1:19:03] the ability
[1:19:04] to give you out of the lure out of your
[1:19:06] womb and bring forth
[1:19:08] life
[1:19:11] adam said that god would have had a
[1:19:14] right
[1:19:15] to kill sarah because she
[1:19:19] called god a liar
[1:19:24] how many people have laughed at this and
[1:19:27] called this
[1:19:27] a lie have called this sarah revelation
[1:19:31] have called it a lie and laughed at it
[1:19:34] and they will say
[1:19:36] i didn't laugh but they have turned down
[1:19:40] their day of repentance
[1:19:44] are you with me lots wife turn back but
[1:19:47] sarah's why
[1:19:48] sarah turned to door jesus
[1:19:51] there's a lot of people that are turning
[1:19:53] away from this
[1:19:55] there's a lot of people that walk down
[1:19:57] the sodom and they walk down to gomorrah
[1:20:00] and you see what it's producing it has
[1:20:02] produced
[1:20:03] a bunch of illegitimate children
[1:20:07] it's produced a bunch of rotten eggs
[1:20:09] that have never been with a male so they
[1:20:11] cannot produce the dna of jesus
[1:20:15] but the one that was sitting outside of
[1:20:17] the tent had the ability
[1:20:19] to change all of the cells of abraham's
[1:20:22] body
[1:20:23] and turn him from a hundred-year-old
[1:20:25] grandpa
[1:20:28] into a fully statured man so that he can
[1:20:31] produce
[1:20:32] that line that royal seed of abraham
[1:20:37] oh hallelujah you see if it would not
[1:20:41] been for an attachment with the king
[1:20:43] there would have been no body change of
[1:20:45] abraham and sarah
[1:20:47] if there would not been of an attachment
[1:20:49] of the king
[1:20:51] if the blood didn't stand up for you you
[1:20:54] would be killed because you were
[1:20:57] unworthy
[1:20:58] but the blood of jesus christ makes you
[1:21:00] worthy
[1:21:02] the blood of jesus christ makes you
[1:21:04] whole
[1:21:06] brother madam said that god has himself
[1:21:09] sowed up as it were
[1:21:10] he can't kill you because there's
[1:21:12] somebody that's standing up for you
[1:21:16] there is an attachment from a king
[1:21:21] and paul said wherefore
[1:21:25] he is not a call ashamed to call you
[1:21:28] brethren
[1:21:33] you remember when when jesus is standing
[1:21:35] there in
[1:21:36] mark chapter 9 he's done send out his
[1:21:38] disciples
[1:21:39] give him power over unclean spirits
[1:21:42] give them power to tread on serpents and
[1:21:44] all those things
[1:21:46] and the disciples had been with jesus
[1:21:48] and there was a
[1:21:50] father that came to jesus and he brought
[1:21:52] to him his son
[1:21:53] in this condition of dealing with an
[1:21:56] epileptic demon that often times it
[1:21:58] would throw him in the fire
[1:21:59] it would tear him apart but you remember
[1:22:01] that as soon
[1:22:03] as soon as that man's son began to look
[1:22:06] on jesus
[1:22:07] that that demon began to thrash and tear
[1:22:10] him apart
[1:22:10] you remember and you wonder sometimes
[1:22:13] what happens to people
[1:22:15] when they come into church and the
[1:22:17] preaching of the word goes forth
[1:22:19] and you'll think my goodness they must
[1:22:21] have got themselves jacked up on some
[1:22:23] mountain dew before they came into
[1:22:24] church
[1:22:25] because they're moving every which way
[1:22:27] and they're all over the place
[1:22:28] what is it it's a demon of hell that's
[1:22:32] getting nervous
[1:22:33] because that demons then got his eyes
[1:22:35] caught on jesus
[1:22:36] and it'll begin to thrash and throw them
[1:22:38] around you want to know something this
[1:22:40] is the best place to get a manicure at
[1:22:44] yeah you just clean this church up one
[1:22:47] time you'll find all kinds of
[1:22:48] fingernails people get nervous in church
[1:22:52] don't call me out but you watch as that
[1:22:55] demon begin
[1:22:58] oh bless the lord i'm gonna put spars
[1:23:01] out of business
[1:23:03] just come to church you get the finest
[1:23:05] ones they don't even bite them down here
[1:23:06] they so nervous ain't catching clipping
[1:23:08] them with other fingernails
[1:23:12] oh lord
[1:23:17] hallelujah anyhow
[1:23:22] but here they watch this demon thrashing
[1:23:26] because he caught jesus he's got his
[1:23:28] eyes on jesus
[1:23:32] and you wonder i'd say that satan
[1:23:36] sometimes gets a look
[1:23:40] looks at john it said how did that god
[1:23:44] get inside of that boy
[1:23:47] and all of hell begins to get nervous
[1:23:49] and shake
[1:23:52] how did all of heaven get in donny
[1:23:54] nicholson
[1:23:57] do you realize this morning that there
[1:23:59] is a great portion of heaven
[1:24:01] that is setting on the inside of your
[1:24:03] soul
[1:24:05] are you with me now they tell me they
[1:24:08] tell me that
[1:24:08] that if a if a meteor or one of those
[1:24:11] rocks come flying down from earth
[1:24:13] from from the sky and it hits the earth
[1:24:15] that if you would take
[1:24:17] that rock and you have the ability to
[1:24:20] throw it back
[1:24:21] into the sun where it came from that it
[1:24:23] would go back
[1:24:24] and would be a part of that sun again
[1:24:27] and if there is a portion of heaven
[1:24:29] that is sitting in your soul
[1:24:32] i am going to a land
[1:24:39] and satan wonders how in the world
[1:24:42] did that god get inside of them 16
[1:24:45] elements called stephen byers
[1:24:48] i want to tell you house hayden
[1:24:52] by one spirit are we baptized into one
[1:24:54] body
[1:24:56] but notice the disciples they came to
[1:25:00] him
[1:25:00] and they said why could not we cast him
[1:25:02] out
[1:25:04] what was it notice jesus never said i'm
[1:25:07] taking my power back from you and you
[1:25:12] think sometimes
[1:25:14] and especially during this
[1:25:17] you think because you don't see a loved
[1:25:19] one
[1:25:20] a loved one completely get healed or or
[1:25:23] you don't see
[1:25:23] you don't see the miracle right before
[1:25:25] your eyes and you think has god taken
[1:25:27] his power away from me
[1:25:29] absolutely not the power was still given
[1:25:33] but jesus said that it's because of your
[1:25:37] faith
[1:25:39] it's because of your faith that has
[1:25:41] hindered you
[1:25:42] from this demon being cast out
[1:25:45] but be of good cheer he has overcome the
[1:25:49] world
[1:25:51] he's given you all the faith that when
[1:25:53] you receive the holy ghost that's
[1:25:55] everything that you have need of in this
[1:25:57] life journey
[1:25:59] but notice who was standing real close
[1:26:03] at that time judas a man
[1:26:06] that carried the bag he'd watched the
[1:26:08] mighty miracles
[1:26:10] he'd seen the healings he watched the
[1:26:12] woman with the blood issue
[1:26:13] he watched as the 5 000 were fed he
[1:26:16] watched when jesus walked
[1:26:18] to the woman and spoke to the woman at
[1:26:20] the well and he discerned the very
[1:26:22] secrets of her heart and he began to
[1:26:23] speak to her
[1:26:26] but judas was instructed from the
[1:26:29] outside
[1:26:32] he could go all the way with jesus
[1:26:34] except for when it came to pentecost
[1:26:37] and he showed his colors when it came to
[1:26:39] that pentecostal experience
[1:26:41] and it'll always show you can have a
[1:26:44] child
[1:26:44] grow up with you you can have be a
[1:26:46] foster parent you can adopt a child and
[1:26:49] maybe you can have
[1:26:50] a a cousin come and stay with you and
[1:26:52] they want to be with your family where
[1:26:54] throughout the summer and play with your
[1:26:56] children
[1:26:57] but you know that they're not your child
[1:27:02] at the end of the day if you're a foster
[1:27:05] parent or if you adopted a child
[1:27:07] you can love them like your own you can
[1:27:09] treat them like your own you can feed
[1:27:11] them like your own
[1:27:13] but the end of the day at the end of the
[1:27:16] facts
[1:27:17] it's still not a part of the dna
[1:27:20] you can treat them like a child you can
[1:27:22] raise them like a child you can dress
[1:27:23] them like a child
[1:27:26] but just because it grows in the house
[1:27:29] doesn't make it yours
[1:27:31] it can have it can even you can watch
[1:27:32] that child
[1:27:34] how that it's made up in different ways
[1:27:37] but it becomes under the influence of
[1:27:38] that household
[1:27:40] that it begins to carry on the
[1:27:41] characteristics and the mannerisms of
[1:27:43] that parent
[1:27:44] you watch a child as they they they grow
[1:27:47] up and you watch a child that they'll
[1:27:48] follow with that husband
[1:27:50] what the husband the head of the house
[1:27:51] does but it still doesn't make them a
[1:27:54] part of it
[1:27:56] because it comes down to a birth
[1:27:59] just stating the facts maybe you're in
[1:28:02] that condition
[1:28:03] and you've had you've been a foster
[1:28:05] parent or you adopted somebody
[1:28:09] but you know at the end of the day
[1:28:11] they're not yours because there
[1:28:15] is a blood cell that is not attached
[1:28:19] and here judas was he was not attached
[1:28:23] he had walked so close he'd been that
[1:28:26] close he'd been to the author of life
[1:28:29] stood right there but because there was
[1:28:31] no birth
[1:28:33] there was no attachment are you with me
[1:28:36] this morning
[1:28:38] so no matter how hard you try you can't
[1:28:41] make them your child
[1:28:43] and no matter how hard you try you can't
[1:28:45] make a sin or a christian
[1:28:48] you can walk with your friends through
[1:28:50] life you can try to show them the
[1:28:52] straight narrow path
[1:28:54] but unless they've been with jesus they
[1:28:56] can never produce
[1:28:58] that life of jesus are you with me this
[1:29:01] morning that
[1:29:02] that that just to be around it is not
[1:29:06] enough i've watched in business
[1:29:07] that we have become great personal
[1:29:09] friends with people in the business
[1:29:12] world
[1:29:12] that we have been identified with watch
[1:29:14] their lives change
[1:29:16] watch them become christians but just
[1:29:18] because they are
[1:29:19] around us is not enough
[1:29:24] it's not enough you've got to get into
[1:29:26] this
[1:29:28] it's got to become a reality it's got to
[1:29:30] be born in you
[1:29:33] hallelujah when i look out across this
[1:29:36] congregation
[1:29:37] and i see people that were walking one
[1:29:40] way that all of a sudden
[1:29:42] that there was a birth that happened
[1:29:44] that there was a transformation that
[1:29:46] took place
[1:29:48] you couldn't have done that would have
[1:29:51] made josh jones the man that he is today
[1:29:54] but god who would have made brother
[1:29:57] donnie nicholson the man that he is
[1:29:59] today
[1:30:00] but god sure brother sam wanted him to
[1:30:03] be in this condition
[1:30:04] maybe 20 or 30 years ago but god
[1:30:06] hallelujah
[1:30:08] had a destination of a dob on brother
[1:30:11] donny
[1:30:12] he's got a dob on every single one of
[1:30:15] you
[1:30:16] he knows where you came from and he
[1:30:18] knows where you're going there is a
[1:30:20] reality
[1:30:21] in this message that will change your
[1:30:24] mind
[1:30:26] this ain't makeup we ain't playing
[1:30:28] church the days of playing church
[1:30:31] are past jesus jesus's first doctrine
[1:30:35] he must be born again
[1:30:39] if there is no birth there is no
[1:30:41] attachment
[1:30:44] my little five-year-old and my little
[1:30:46] nine-year-old
[1:30:48] they have an amazing imagination
[1:30:51] amazing
[1:30:54] they you know it's amazing to watch them
[1:30:58] step into a role i think every girl goes
[1:31:02] through this
[1:31:04] they're in a stage of horses right now
[1:31:08] and they just love to play horses
[1:31:11] it's amazing the influence that they're
[1:31:13] under
[1:31:14] i never would have thought that their
[1:31:16] aunt stephanie by now
[1:31:18] could be considered could be considered
[1:31:20] my sister basically
[1:31:21] would have that much influence on my
[1:31:24] girls
[1:31:26] but my girls you watch them they can go
[1:31:29] out and they can go
[1:31:30] out in my garage and they can grab
[1:31:31] themself a metal stool
[1:31:33] put bungee cords on that stool and you
[1:31:35] would think that they were riding
[1:31:36] through the okay corral
[1:31:40] and they are crossing their crossing
[1:31:42] montana
[1:31:43] crossing wyoming and they're just going
[1:31:46] and they're just riding and if you could
[1:31:48] just
[1:31:48] get a glimpse of their imagination you
[1:31:51] would see that the mane of that horse is
[1:31:53] coming back
[1:31:54] and it's brushing writing their face as
[1:31:56] they're riding into the sunset
[1:32:01] it's amazing but when they're done
[1:32:04] they put that stool back put that bungee
[1:32:06] cord back
[1:32:08] you know what those girls know that
[1:32:10] they're riding
[1:32:11] a stool and they're not riding a horse
[1:32:16] but i'm afraid that too many people have
[1:32:18] confessed to be christians
[1:32:21] and they have never come to the reality
[1:32:23] of this message
[1:32:24] and what the riding on is just a metal
[1:32:26] stool
[1:32:27] and they'll stay right there and they've
[1:32:29] never had a reality of riding on this
[1:32:32] holy ghost
[1:32:32] and the holy ghost taken them by the
[1:32:34] reins of their heart
[1:32:36] and riding them through laodicea without
[1:32:39] without without wavering that she's
[1:32:42] going to overcome
[1:32:43] that god would bless her going in and
[1:32:45] coming out
[1:32:47] but you see there is a power there is a
[1:32:50] message
[1:32:51] that will put you right into a body
[1:32:53] change
[1:32:56] you can be that close you can profess
[1:32:59] all you want to
[1:33:00] but if you don't have this
[1:33:06] so is this is this a reality
[1:33:09] or is this imaginary
[1:33:12] are you setting on a pew or here are you
[1:33:16] in the word
[1:33:19] are you attached or are you detached
[1:33:22] are you in this thing to win this thing
[1:33:24] are you in it to give up
[1:33:27] are you in it no matter what you go
[1:33:29] through
[1:33:30] as my granddaddy homer would say i'm
[1:33:32] shooting for the stars when i hit a
[1:33:34] stump every time or not
[1:33:36] i'm going to keep pressing on
[1:33:40] no matter what i go through god is
[1:33:43] bigger than my problems
[1:33:50] i told the boys this morning they asked
[1:33:51] me i said what you're preaching today i
[1:33:52] said i'm gonna get up and i'm gonna play
[1:33:54] part two
[1:33:55] i'm gonna just replay last night
[1:33:59] god is bigger than my problems
[1:34:05] there is an attachment that makes you
[1:34:08] realize
[1:34:10] that makes you realize
[1:34:14] that you're not from this world
[1:34:20] you're just passing through
[1:34:24] where are you standing at where you're
[1:34:27] living at
[1:34:28] what you're going through what life are
[1:34:30] you living
[1:34:33] is it just emotions or is it a reality
[1:34:38] is it truth or is it false
[1:34:42] where are you standing at i read a book
[1:34:46] a few days ago
[1:34:50] you'll laugh at it but on who moved my
[1:34:52] cheese
[1:34:55] who moved my cheese and the the moral of
[1:34:57] the story is basically being able to
[1:34:59] adapt to change
[1:35:02] little mice getting upset because
[1:35:04] somebody moved their cheese
[1:35:06] it's kind of weird an adult reading
[1:35:07] something about mice
[1:35:10] moving cheese but walt disney sugar was
[1:35:12] made out pretty good
[1:35:15] but in that in that book it said this
[1:35:18] statement
[1:35:20] what would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:35:24] what would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:35:30] what a resignating statement
[1:35:33] what would you do this morning if you
[1:35:35] weren't afraid
[1:35:37] i wonder what some of you do would do if
[1:35:39] you wasn't afraid of coven i wonder what
[1:35:42] you would do if you weren't afraid
[1:35:44] that you could just break into a spear a
[1:35:47] sphere
[1:35:48] of an atmosphere of praising him i
[1:35:50] wonder what you would do
[1:35:52] if you weren't afraid this morning
[1:35:55] i wonder what you would do this morning
[1:35:58] if you weren't afraid
[1:36:00] that i would call you out for setting on
[1:36:02] me i wonder what you would do
[1:36:04] if you really got into the things of
[1:36:07] life
[1:36:08] if you really pass press past what you
[1:36:11] are seeing
[1:36:12] and you begin to break into that channel
[1:36:15] of the atmosphere of the word
[1:36:17] i wonder if you would really be riding
[1:36:20] on a horse
[1:36:21] or would you be sitting on a stool
[1:36:26] what would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:36:35] i'm afraid that if i get in the spirit
[1:36:37] that somebody will call me out
[1:36:40] i'm afraid that if i get emotion that
[1:36:42] somebody will say that was just me
[1:36:44] i'm afraid that if i step out and take a
[1:36:46] leap of faith
[1:36:47] that god will leave me hanging what
[1:36:50] would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:36:53] i'm afraid that if i believe god will
[1:36:56] let me down like you did before
[1:36:57] god has never let you down and god will
[1:37:01] never
[1:37:01] back up on his promises
[1:37:05] what would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:37:08] you've got a god that you can trust he
[1:37:11] said i am the lord that healeth all of
[1:37:13] thy diseases
[1:37:14] i am the lord thy god that forgiveth the
[1:37:16] all thy iniquities
[1:37:18] what would you do this morning if you
[1:37:19] weren't afraid
[1:37:22] would you praise him to the walls came
[1:37:24] down
[1:37:25] if you had a loved one that was sick and
[1:37:28] body would you tear the roof off of this
[1:37:30] place
[1:37:30] just to get them in the presence of
[1:37:32] jesus
[1:37:34] somebody wasn't afraid to do it
[1:37:37] legion wasn't afraid to press pass press
[1:37:40] past whatever he was thinking
[1:37:42] of all those chains and all those demons
[1:37:44] that were holding him down
[1:37:45] brother branham said that if
[1:37:49] legion wouldn't have pushed his way out
[1:37:50] there those demons never would have came
[1:37:52] out to jesus
[1:37:54] what would you do this morning if you
[1:37:57] weren't afraid
[1:38:00] jesus would say fear not fear not
[1:38:08] what life are we living in what spot are
[1:38:11] we sitting at in our christian walk
[1:38:14] are we going backwards or are we going
[1:38:17] forward
[1:38:19] where is the attachment
[1:38:22] that seed if it's a predestinated seed
[1:38:26] it will not predestination does not pull
[1:38:28] you back
[1:38:29] and draw you back into a shall pray
[1:38:31] destination will thrust you forward
[1:38:34] well i'm gonna be in the rapture if god
[1:38:37] predestinated me before the foundation
[1:38:40] of the world
[1:38:40] i'm gonna be there i'm afraid you won't
[1:38:44] if you've got that kind of mentality i
[1:38:46] will just sit back
[1:38:48] and i will do as i want to if god's
[1:38:51] going to get me there
[1:38:52] god's going to get me there
[1:38:56] if god's going to give me this god will
[1:38:59] give it to me and i won't have to
[1:39:00] believe for it
[1:39:01] you've got the wrong mentality
[1:39:06] yes he said he'd heal you yes he said
[1:39:08] he'd deliver you
[1:39:10] yes he said he'd give you the promise
[1:39:12] yes he said he'd give you the holy ghost
[1:39:14] but you got something to do too
[1:39:16] you got to fight past your fear
[1:39:19] you got to fight past what you're seeing
[1:39:24] you know so many people get that close
[1:39:27] they get that close and they give up
[1:39:31] what is laying on the inside of you
[1:39:34] is it a predestinated seed that says no
[1:39:37] matter what
[1:39:37] i'm not backing up i'm not giving up i'm
[1:39:40] not turning around
[1:39:42] i'm setting my feet on solid ground
[1:39:49] let's stand this morning
[1:39:53] what would you do if you weren't afraid
[1:40:08] because if the life of beethoven's in me
[1:40:11] i'll do the works of beethoven
[1:40:14] if the life of a great mechanic is in me
[1:40:17] you would expect me to
[1:40:19] be oily and have rags and have mechanic
[1:40:22] coveralls on
[1:40:23] and i would do the works i'm a mechanic
[1:40:26] but if i told you i was a great mechanic
[1:40:30] i didn't i didn't have a single tool i
[1:40:32] didn't have no grease under my
[1:40:34] fingernails
[1:40:35] you'd question my ability as a mechanic
[1:40:40] but if you say you got the spirit of
[1:40:41] christ and you ain't got the love of
[1:40:44] christ under your fingernails
[1:40:46] if your knees haven't hit the ground in
[1:40:48] a while it would make you
[1:40:50] question what life am i living
[1:40:53] where am i sitting there i got good news
[1:40:56] for you that believe
[1:40:58] the rapture is at hand but i got bad
[1:41:01] news for y'all that don't believe
[1:41:04] i'm not saying any of you here i'm just
[1:41:06] preaching
[1:41:08] but for people that don't believe
[1:41:10] there's a rapture coming
[1:41:13] whether you believe it or whether you
[1:41:14] don't there's a rapture coming
[1:41:17] whether you want to go whether you don't
[1:41:19] there's a rapture coming
[1:41:21] whether you want to go through the
[1:41:22] tribulation or not the tribulation's
[1:41:24] coming
[1:41:25] but the bride is not going through the
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:30] tribulation
[1:41:39] i got good news god has given me the
[1:41:43] revelation
[1:41:44] of when he's coming i know that scares
[1:41:47] some people because the bible said that
[1:41:48] no man knows the hour nor the day when
[1:41:50] he cometh but i know it
[1:41:53] in a moment in a moment
[1:41:56] in a twinkling of an eye he's coming
[1:42:00] it may not be this moment but he's
[1:42:01] coming in a moment
[1:42:04] hallelujah it may not be today and may
[1:42:06] not be tomorrow but he's coming in the
[1:42:08] morning
[1:42:09] it may not be when i see it it may not
[1:42:11] be when i feel it but i know that it's
[1:42:13] coming in a moment
[1:42:15] i can tell you i'm gonna come by your
[1:42:17] house i'm gonna eat some of your apple
[1:42:18] pie
[1:42:20] and i may never get there because you
[1:42:22] never invited me for that apple pie
[1:42:25] but there's one thing for sure that if
[1:42:27] jesus said he's coming
[1:42:29] he's coming in a moment
[1:42:33] what would you do this morning if you
[1:42:35] wasn't afraid
[1:42:37] i'm not talking about in the natural
[1:42:39] just going out and licking doorknobs
[1:42:42] i'm not afraid of covet what kind of
[1:42:44] insane person are you
[1:42:48] i'm not talking about that i'm talking
[1:42:49] about in the spirit realm
[1:42:51] what would you do
[1:42:56] has given us talents god's given us
[1:42:57] abilities but what would you do
[1:43:02] whose servants you yield yourself
[1:43:06] where your members lie
[1:43:09] i wonder this morning are you sitting on
[1:43:12] a store with a bungee cord
[1:43:14] or are you really in the tune of this
[1:43:16] message
[1:43:19] are you marching right in the keys
[1:43:24] you going on with jesus no matter what
[1:43:26] you see
[1:43:29] we're going into a very dark realm here
[1:43:31] shortly
[1:43:34] october 31st there's a lot of people
[1:43:35] that come out on a wicked day and they
[1:43:37] produce all kinds of evilness
[1:43:39] and there's a lot of people that attach
[1:43:40] themselves to them
[1:43:43] they love that thrill of getting scared
[1:43:47] as davey breeden told me he said i hunt
[1:43:49] too much to get scared stuff like that i
[1:43:51] walk out in the dark
[1:43:52] i said i ain't no way i'm going around
[1:43:54] that stuff
[1:43:57] but it shows when people begin to attach
[1:43:59] themselves to
[1:44:01] oh i just love that thrill of getting
[1:44:02] scared or i i just
[1:44:05] oh i just want to go and be a part of
[1:44:06] those things
[1:44:09] it shows where your attachment's land
[1:44:12] it really does half of you dressed up
[1:44:16] for halloween anyway got your mask on
[1:44:20] little joke for you but some of you get
[1:44:23] it today some of you get it tomorrow
[1:44:24] some of you never get it
[1:44:26] most of you but it shows where your
[1:44:29] attachment's laying
[1:44:32] if you are drawing from this world more
[1:44:35] than you're drawing
[1:44:36] from that world
[1:44:39] it shows where you're coming from and it
[1:44:41] shows where you're going
[1:44:44] but you can change where your
[1:44:47] allegiance lie and it only takes one
[1:44:51] moment
[1:44:52] it's amazing the power of forgiveness
[1:44:58] that god in one moment
[1:45:02] completely forgives everything that
[1:45:04] you've done wrong
[1:45:08] and if there is just one part of an
[1:45:11] attachment
[1:45:12] i say god i didn't mean to do that
[1:45:16] it shows where you're coming from
[1:45:20] it shows that there's something laying
[1:45:22] there do you love the lord this morning
[1:45:25] give the lord a handclap of praise
