or this afternoon and we thank the lord for that this afternoon as well and glad to have my wife here with me this evening and we're very happy and excited this season we're expecting our first child let me correct that she's expecting our first child i've heard i've heard too many sermons from brother ron amen so we sure thank the lord for that glad to have brother uh junior and sister brook mass here with us from the church this evening and it's just good to be together isn't it amen times like this it's good to be together anytime amen just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together how many just ask the lord to come by and speak to you tonight amen i believe he's able to do that heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered here this evening lord i know that this is their scheduled service of the week father they have their services on saturday evening and sunday morning but lord i believe that this is not just a tradition or a ritual to the believers it's standing before me tonight but lord this is their life this is what they live for lord they live for these moments and lord the past few years the lord the devil has done everything he can to rob him of these moments and to rob him of the uh the believers around the world of the privilege of just being able to assemble ourselves together but lord we stand here tonight as a witness unto hell and to every devil of covet and viruses you didn't win we're still standing we're still assembling we're still moving forward and tonight lord i pray that you would come by our way and lord for these next few moments as the songs of zion has been sung lord as the atmosphere has been created we trust lord that you would be pleased with it father and lord we're inviting you now to come in the ministry and of your word lord you see these thoughts and and things that you've laid up on my heart lord i have no way of lord ministering this to the needs of every one of your children but lord if i can get myself out of the way then you can come and take your word and you can minister it and lord you can divide it lot by lot to each believer what they have need of so tonight lord is i report for duty i surrender myself to you tonight lord i surrender my thoughts lord may you come and inhabit this vessel lord may you take control but lord may you not only anoint me to speak father but lord may you anoint the people to hear lord may you not just speak through me lord but may you hear through them father may you become the filter lord that i would speak through may you become the filter that we would hear through tonight lord and father i pray for those that are sick tonight dear god we're asking your mercy and grace may you reach down to them dear god may you drive out sicknesses from their bodies lord for those that are bound tonight dear god i i pray that you would send the liberty of the holy spirit into this building tonight may you drive out every bondage and tear down every stronghold lord may reasoning leave the minds of your children as they hear the word and lord may they be able to respond to that word and identify themselves in the promises o god lord we're asking you to move among us we submit ourselves unto thee have thy own way among us lord forgive us of our failures forgive us of our shortcomings lord may when we leave this meeting tonight may we be able to say did not our hearts burn within us as he came and talked to us along the way and we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen psalms 34 and verse number eight you love the lord this evening amen the bible here says old taste and see that the lord is good i love this part blessed is the man that trusteth in him taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him now we didn't know until a prophet come that there was actually another portion of the scripture and it's found in matthew 11 chapter if we could look there in matthew 11 amen blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord how many people here tonight trust in the lord amen matthew the 11th chapter and then the 28th verse this this is the blessing of psalms 34 and verse 8. matthew 11 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart notice this and you shall find rest unto your souls now what stands out to me there is out of the three-part being that we are body spirit and soul that he specifically identifies the place this rest is coming to you shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon i want to by the help of the lord to take a thought out of those two verses we've we've read tonight and if i will title this sermon tonight i want to speak to you on the believer's rest the believer's rest how many believers do we have here this evening if you're not a believer then you're probably not going to get much out of this service but if you are a believer even you'll get something from the word amen we're not gathered here tonight as make believers we're not gathered here as unbelievers i'll go a step further and say we're not even gathered here as borderline believers amen but i believe we've gathered here as real genuine true believers of the word of god and there's one thing that i find that two things that a believer must do and that is they must trust in god and they must rest in god a true believer must trust in god and then a true believer must rest in god now i was sharing with brother ron i woke up this morning and on my heart with scriptures and thoughts about trusting and i was just praying then the lord just dropped this on my heart in order to rest you've got to have trust and you know as well as i know that when brother ron begin this battle that one of the first things the lord spoke to him i trust it's okay to share this again was if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and you know i find that if you don't have trust in something then there's no way that you can rest if you don't have trust in the government then there's no way you can rest in what they're doing if you don't have trust in a in your boss and there's no way you can rest and what he's doing so in order to really rest you've got to be able to trust and david says in psalms 37 5 he says commit thy way unto the lord and trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass now who's going to bring this to pass david is not going to bring it to pass and a man is not going to bring it to pass but david says i'm going to commit this way into the lord and he is able to bring it to pass the prophet of god said when they make a committal to god committed to him and believe him amen then it brings forth the results so the results don't come amen just by hearing or just by acknowledging amen but the results come when you're able to believe it amen and trust in the one that you're hearing the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said god made the promise then god is going to keep the promise how many witnesses do we have here tonight that if god makes a promise and then god is able to keep the promise see they say well how can this thing happen how can he get a bunch of people together with rapturing grace to go up i don't know how he will do it it's not my business to ask how he'll do it amen he'll do it it's my business just to be ready for it amen it's not my business to figure out how that he's going to gather a group of people from all over the world and give them rapturing faith and give them rapturing grace and put in them rapturing strength i don't know how he's going to do it amen but i'm just going to be ready because he's going to do it amen if he said the walls are going to come down i don't know how they're going to come down i just know i heard him say the walls are coming down i don't know how he's going to raise up people amen that's been laying in the ground since all the way back 6 000 years ago i don't know how that job is going to come forth i don't know how that elijah and all the others is going to come forth amen but all i know is he said he will do it and everything he ever said he would do amen he's been god big enough to do it i don't know how he's going to save that wayward child amen but his word said he will do it and if his word said he will do it there ain't enough devils in hell amen to back him off with his word if he said it'll heal you when you're sick there ain't enough devils in hell he meant to keep a sickness in your body i don't know how he's going to do it i don't know when he's going to do it i don't know what time he's going to do it amen but i've heard the word of the lord and the word said he's more than able he meant to do exceedingly independently above all that we could ever ask her to say i don't know when these bodies are going to change i just know he said some morning we're going to feel a sweet come over our bodies and gray hair is going to disappear and stupid soldiers are going to straighten us i don't know how he's going to do it amen but i'm not worried about figuring out i'm just going to be ready i'm just going to be ready because he said he would do it he said he would bring the life down and he brought him down he said he would bring israel through and he brought israel through there's nothing too big for my god he's god on the mountain he's god in the valley he's god regardless of the conditions there is nothing our god cannot do he promised it's going to happen and he has fortified his church by the promise of his word i don't know how it's going to happen i don't know when it's going to happen i just know it's going to happen when i'm already testifying before i start preaching amen is there any believers here tonight amen that still believes god amen can do the impossible he can do it when it looks like it can never be done you say how can you do it because he's god amen what brother andrew i've got a problem i can't let go of the situation then god can never move upon the situation well brother andrew i got to keep my hands on it amen god can never move as long as our hands are on it he said as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them god cannot fight your battle amen you're fighting it yourself so you just let loose and let him do it amen the greatest weapon i know of of a christian today is a committal to god the greatest weapon i know of today of a christian is a committal to god when you can't do nothing about it amen just committed to him and god will take care of every bit of it amen when you prayed to you can't pray no more just committed unto god when you fast it till you can't fast no more just committed unto god he is able to take care of it do you believe that amen david said in psalms 118 and verse 8 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man amen i'll put my trust in the lord he met above joe biden above donald trump above obama and his mama i'll put my trust in jesus christ he has never entered the arena one time but what he has carried out to victory he's the god that walks on water he's the god that opens blinded eyes he's the god that stops funeral processions and calls the dead back to life again he's the god that takes an alcoholic and turns him into a preacher he's the god that takes a street walker and turns her into a clean living woman i'm not talking about a man i'm talking about jesus he's the lord he's the lord of every devil he's the lord over ever sickness he's the lord over every sin and he's still big enough and he's still strong enough to move upon the face of the situation amen let me put my voice amen in song in solomon's proverbs when he said trust in the lord with all thine heart thank you brother trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto my own understanding he'll say isaiah 26 4 trust you in the lord forever amen for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength if you put your trust in the lord you will have everlasting strength the prophet said there is no big people among us there is no great among us we are all the same we are the children of god there is only one great one among us and that is christ how many would agree there's only one great one among us and that is christ we must recognize him amen and if we seek honor one from another then we can't have faith because we're having faith in one another amen if you're seeking honor from one another then you're putting your confidence in one another amen and you'll never have faith in god as long as you're seeking honor amen or answers from one another he said but when we get to have faith in christ he is the one that's among us that we must have faith in amen notice this he is the one among us that we must have faith in and then faith in what he's doing and his gift to us so we're not just putting our faith in him but our faith is in what he's doing he meant in us and what he has given us amen i find it amazing that in 1956 brother branham preaches a sermon called amen why are people so tossed about amen it's amazing he'll open it up by saying the other night i woke up and i just wanted to preach he said what nobody preached to he said so i woke my wife up and he said she was gracious enough he meant to listen for a little bit and she fell back asleep it's amazing to me what he was wanting to preach on was rest and he woke her from sleeping amen he said i wanted to preach a sermon on rest he said i said the christian faith is based solely upon rest amen a christian is not tossed about are you hearing me now a christian is not tossed about a christian doesn't run from place to place a christian don't fuss and fume and worry about all things a christian rest it's all over it's all finished amen for the believer at calvary that's right sickness may come disappointments may come but the christians at rest knowing this that god's able to keep bad which he has performed that knowing no matter what the thing is or how it looks there's neither sickness sorrow death there's neither starvation or anything that can separate us from the love of god that is in jesus christ we are at rest amen if you're worried then you're not at rest if you're fussing you're not at rest if you're fuming you're not at rest amen if you're all tore up you're not at rest amen but the prophet said a christian amen don't do those things amen a christian comes to a place of rest amen just let the old ship amen tossed any way she wants to amen but the anchor holds amen i'll tell you what paul said he said which hope we have as an anchor of the soul notice where he's going with this he's not going to the flesh he's not going to the spirit he's going to the real you amen there is an anchor of the soul which is both sure and steadfast amen which entereth into that within the veil amen the prophet of god said see our anchor is not holding with outside of the veil our anchor is holding in the veil amen what is a veil it is something that shuts off here from there amen so you're here but you can't see there because there's something between you and there amen and the anchor is on the inside of the veil you don't see how it's going to be but you know there's something oh god you know there's something that's got a hold of you that can hold up there you're like the boy flying the kite the kind is way up there amen and you're soaring the kind and the old critic comes by and says still preaching the message are you amen still believe in the pillar of fire it's accompanying the message still believing in 1963 or was the cloud come down and revelation 10 1 is fulfilled still believing they shall cast out devils still believing in prayer lines still believing and dancing still believing breaking out in unknown tongues and shouting worship and god still believing and seeing visions and dreams yes sir and the old critic says how do you know what you're believing is any good he said cause every now and again amen i can't see it but i feel a tug on the other side of the crowd well glory to god anyhow i believe there's some believers here tonight we don't know how we're going to get through it we can't see our way through it but right here tonight i feel a pull i feel a tug i feel a charge coming from another dimension it's saying hold on amen stay in line keep on preaching keep on believing keep on worshiping keep on saying all things are possible and one of these days you're going to step out of time into eternity i'm not a crazy worked up man i am a believer i've got an anchor i can't see it but i know it's there [Applause] there's some witnesses here he got you through the first trial didn't he he got you through the first disappointment he got you through the first sickness if he got you through one time he'll get you through again there is no limits there is no limits on my god you don't see how it's going to be but there's something holding within the veil the plot of god said i saw a ship on the water one time in a storm he said that old ship there was rocking back and forth and there was some waves that would go in are you ready for this there was some waves that would go in there was some waves that would go under and everything and i said wonder why that is and a fellow said it's got a sea anchor on it therefore they said the ship cannot sink testing one two therefore the ship cannot sink i said it can go through the waves but it can't sink because it's anchored oh praise god we've got an anchor some waves we can go over some we go under but regardless the anchor holds come on amen there's a witness here tonight every wave that ever come up against you it wasn't big enough amen to sink this whole ship aside come on now you've been through some waves that should have took you to the bottom you've been through some waves that should have drowned you it should have took you out a long time ago but you're still sailing on last solomaine because you got an anchor and it's holding beyond feelings it's holding beyond the emotions it's holding beyond church hannity there is an anchor that is anchored in the eternities no wonder the prophet of god said when you recognize the word was eagle food and you left the other thing you heard from your theophany in other words your theophany from another dimension tugged at you and reminded you that before you was born there was already an anchor come on how can you lose when there was already an anchor on the inside of you before you come in the world there was a gene seed of god on the inside of your soul that was anchoring you to the word of god it isn't the ship doing the holding it is the anchor doing the holding it just isn't what i am or what i'll be or what i was it is what he is now and what he did for me and you it ain't what i can do it's what he has done amen how many has ever noticed that there's christians amen that's always up and down amen they're very religious amen but have such a deep desire and daily they search and they hunt and they seek for god but they never come to any settlement or any settled anchor in christ you know why that is because the prophet said there's two phases of christianity he said one of them is an intellectual or mental conception which takes place in the head he said but i love this next one he said but the other one is what we call experimental experience now come on friends ain't that there's one that's intellectual or mental conception which is in the head he said but the other one is what we call a mental or not a mental but an experimental experience amen where does that take place it takes place in the heart then you can talk somebody out of an intellectual conception but you can't talk them out of an experimental experience you know why because they've seen it happen i remember as a little kid i was down in my most at my mom's house one day we was at home there and i'd taken a measuring tape and i hooked it on one end of the wall and i pulled it all the way down to the other end it's about 10 30 11 o'clock that night and i remember i was i was in there and mom was in the bathroom amen i was measuring stuff because i was a construction worker's kid you know that's what i wanted to be so i was measuring stuff and i was getting ready to remodel the house you know so i'm in there measuring all of a sudden and then the measuring tape drops off and it slips down into the outlet and it arcs and the thing blows smoke and fire and i dropped a thing and took off screaming well my uncle may be watching my uncle matthew amen he's an electrician so he comes down to the house and he stands and he says well what happened well i said i don't know what happened i don't know what happened he said now did you do this i don't know what happened he said well let me just show you what i think happened he said here's what happened i think you hooked the measuring tape here and you pulled it down and just before he did it i said don't do it it'll set you on fire it'll shock you amen you know why amen because as much as i wanted to not believe it in my head my heart had experienced a shock and there are some believers here tonight amen the devil's done everything he can amen to talk you out of your inheritance to rob you of this message to steal your joy and steal your peace there's some of you ain't shouted in a month of sunday's amen called some old dry critical devil amen said we shouldn't be shouted in the house of god amen but i didn't come to preach to a bunch of mental worked up extensions i come to talk to somebody that can say i know what it's like to be on the sea and the waves are rocking and the storm are rolling and then jesus come walking on the sea i know what it's like when the doctor says there's no more hope and then the fourth man steps in the room i know what it's like when it looks like it's all over and he speaks it's just getting started i'm talking about experimental experienced christians who can say amen and fulfill the words of john 5 24 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life notice this and should not come into condemnation but it's past somebody shout past but his passed from death unto life the prophet said what do you have to do you have to believe and hear faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word then you are believing and applying and resting can we say that together believing applying and resting a true believer believes a true believer applies and a true believer rests you see it the word says soul you hear it so when the word says so you hear it then your heart says so and you believe it then your whole being amen rest in it so your whole being is resting in what you're amen and what you heard and what your heart believed is bringing your whole being subject to the word it's here it's in the easter seal he said it'll do the same thing in you the quickening power that he did in jesus he said it brought his body subject to the word right he meant in that same word in you oh god i know people sometimes get hung up when they go to preaching about about not living and sin and and not smoking cigarettes and not drinking it not wearing worldly fashions and all these things but let me tell you what them are they were little little immoral things and i'll tell you what the prophet said he said if the holy ghost which is the quickening power comes in you he said it won't be you say i stopped it he said then the immoral things will just drop off he meant because there's something coming in you that's more greater than your human ability to reason whether the thing is right or not faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word jesus said are you ready for this how many thanks god for prophetic interpretation he that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me half everlasting hath eternal he says never ending always existing life ever ever exist in life and shall never perish but have already passed from death into life are you ready for this has passed from separation into everlasting presence you have passed from separation into everlasting presence amen then where is the joy of the lord made full it's in the presence of god what did a prophet say it's in a message called in his presence he said no man can come in the presence of god and remain the same man he was when he came in he'll either leave there better or worse amen i say thank god that the presence of god has returned to the church of god amen not just to excite us he meant to but to bring a change to put a distinction between us in laodicea to put a mark of demarcation between us and the things of the world amen when you was an alien from god you cease to be an alien now you are a child are you ready for this from death and alive from darkness and today amen from mortal to immortal from corruption to incorruption from weary unto joy from death into life and are resting fully upon thus saith the lord you're not resting upon what a preacher said you're not resting upon what a pastor said or even just what a prophet said you are resting upon what the lord has said in the generation you're living in not upon feelings not upon me emotions are you hearing me not upon theory not upon someone on something that somebody has said amen to you that had no basis oh i could preach there for about three hours not up on something that somebody thought would be better i'll tell you what they say now they say what's better than the holy ghost is psychology and i call that a devil spirit from the prince of hell amen bring that psychology in the house of god and you'll have a bunch of rehab sinners sitting around talking about what god used to do but i just happened to draw a sword and cut the head off that devil there is no room in the house of god amen for rehab we believe in transformation by the power of the holy ghost i still believe the holy ghost amen can take a pervert and make a clean living man out of him i still believe the holy ghost amen can take a homosexual and make a real man out of it i still believe the holy ghost can take a teenager that's on the road to suicide and a premature grave and get a hold of him in the presence of god and can cause him to pass amen from death into life i still believe in the holy ghost come on church i still believe god can move i don't care how dark it is i don't care how ugly it is i still believe god can transform lives by the power of the new birth he can take somebody amen from just theories and emotions amen and psychologies and theories of man upon someone say well you come and join our church and it'll be finished but upon the word of god somebody shout the word of god is where the human soul rests the word of god is where the human soul rests there's that word again but andrew rest what is this rest that jesus is speaking of it must be so powerful that he would actually invite you oh god i could preach there for 20 minutes it must be so powerful that he would invite you to come and partake of it that he would stand up and say come unto me all ye that are labia and better labor and heavy laden and i will give you rest amen look at what this word rest means are you ready it means to refresh it means to cause or permit one to cease from any movement or labor in order to recover and collect his strength somebody shout strength this rest is a rest for you to cease from any movement or any labor in order to recover and to collect strength amen it's the means to keep quiet it is of calm oh god of calm and patient expectation see the problem god said in the contest let us go in the power of his resurrection let us go in the name of jesus christ to meet the enemy because he is getting stronger and more powerful every day and as the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god raises up a standard against him if we have come to the end of these things and the mysteries of god has been completed with us we are looking for more strength amen a rapturing strength to meet a worse force that will rapture the church and take it into glory then we don't just need a strength to go from one church age to a next we're just not looking for a strength ain't meant to go from one service to an ex wheat but andrew are actually looking for strength that's going to be so powerful it is literally going to lift us off of the earth in a dynamic rapture some morning well preach preacher thank you i believe i will amen i'm talking about a strength amen it'll get you through whatever you come up against i'm talking about a strength that no matter how dark it gets when you don't have the strength to raise your hand that strength on the inside of you will cause you to raise your hand this is a strength this is i mean let me stop and say this i'm not talking about the rest of a laziness i'm not talking about a thoughtful kickback in the easy chair and get a cup of coffee and don't pray and don't fast don't come to church i'm not talking about a rest like an easy time i'm talking about a rest amen that's rest of the soul that brings you from being worried and tore up and in and out and up and down amen to a place of stability now when you speak of this rest you'll find there was a physical rest and there was a spiritual rest the prophet of god says adoption he says israel was promised a physical rest he said the church was promised a spiritual rest so god promised to give us a rest is there one promise for the gabriel that god has made that he's not been able to fulfill is there one promised church that god made you and over 600 promises in one book called the bible and 1100 tapes and books is there one promise you can find in there amen that god has not been able to fulfill if god said he would give you illuminating lights he'd been to see the revelation of your age he has fulfilled that promise if he said he would send malachi 4. this day this promise is fulfilled if he said he would fulfill luke 17 30 and revelation 10 amen this day the scripture's fulfilled then if god can fulfill those promises he can fulfill this promise what is the rest the prophet said where is it is it joining church is it being baptized a certain way is it becoming a member of the greatest church in the city where in better clothes is it education is it money amen so we can just all quit work and lay around the rest of our lives as we call it that is not it remember so when you think of the word rest you think of the word sabbath right which in revelation 1 10 i was in the spirit on the lord's day time out even going preacher for a second that right there's the answer to a lot of your problems is get out of the flesh one time and get in the spirit [Music] well but i think we got too much shout i think we got too many people in the flesh i've been in the flesh 25 years i've been looking to get out of the flesh rather than get in the flesh even quit worrying about the flesh let's get in the spirit the prophet said if we're going to preach let's preach in the spirit can i take some liberty here amen i'll just be honest with you that's okay i'm a little tired of intellectual speaking i'm ready for some old fat old-fashioned sacrifice amen holy ghost field devil chasing sin stomping amen pillar of fire move and preach it it'll bring the power of god back in the church that'll change our young people come on we've filled up psychologist offices long enough we need a change by the power of the holy ghost and he's still here and he's still able to do it if any two or three will agree it's touching any one thing upon the earth it shall be done in heaven if you agree and i agree the bible says one can put a thousand to fly and two can put ten thousand then what about a whole church full of believers tonight that would welcome the spirit of the lord in the full gospel revival center and let the power of god amen root out every root of bitterness destroy every bad attitude stabilize every bad mood remove every sin and destroy every iniquity among friends is he's still able to do it or not [Applause] he's still god this rest is more than the flesh this is a spiritual rest now the prophet said i was in the spirit on the lord's day he said that is the whole of the christian life john was in the spirit on the lord's day fine folks called the lord's day the sabbath west to them is saturday others call the lord's day sunday which is the first day of the week but how could either of these days be right when the bible says amen that john was called up in the spirit and transported into the lord's day which is yet to come he said but in the meantime just to settle our minds let's find out exactly what this sabbath is he said the sabbath as we know from the new testament is not the keeping of a certain day then what is that that is a law right that is a rich we'll keep a certain day amen we have no command to keep saturday or do we have any commandment to keep the first day which is sunday here is the truth of the sabbath it means rest now in the book of hebrews paul labor's very heavy in this point revel rather hebrews 3 hebrews 4 to show you that god had arrest israel had arrest and the church had arrest he said now watch god entered his rest he said israel never entered their rest amen why because of unbelief he said what is unbelief unbelief is sin you read in hebrews 3 amen do you see amen don't you act like they did in the days of provocation when they provoke god how did they do it brother andrew how did they provoke god did they do it by living immorally were they out running up and down the streets and carousing and gambling the prompt of god said no the sin is when god shows himself and you disbelieve it and won't listen to it the sin is when you see the manifestation of god you refuse to believe what you see and you won't obey the instructions that it released well i might as well preach i'm here hadn't amen amen sin is not smoking sin is not breaking sin is not corrosive that is the attributes of sin the prophet labored from 47 to 65 to drive the point home that sin is unbelief amen then the bible says let us therefore fear amen lest the promised being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come sort of the prophet said only reason there is to fear is if there is no promise then if there is no promise this church has got a right to be under a cloud of fear if there is no promise you've got a right for your family to be buried under the clouds of fear but let me back that devil up in a corner and remind you there are more than one promise there's a whole bible of promises and paul said the promises of god are yea and amen and in them they're not up one day and down the next well thank you lord it's coming faster and i can get it out these promises are not unstable these are stable promises these are absolute promises these are more sure word of prophecy promises amen god come down to make the promise a reality than if it's going to be made a reality it's got to be the same promise the same rest the same god the same side it's got to be the same thing now do you realize why they did not enter the rest is because the word was preached to all but only a few heard and applied and rested in the word the bible says is this okay for unto us the gospel was preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith and them that heard it see no matter how much the word is preached no matter how well you like the way it's been preached unless you yourself are a partaker of that word it won't do you one bit of good well brandon i'm going to move churches well go ahead and move if the man's preaching the message he'll be saying the same thing andrew and ron and everyone else is saying if he's preaching the message well but then i'm going to leave this minister amen you can move churches till you run out of money and u-haul is your best friend but until you get some faith in your soul ain't meant to receive what you're hearing you're never going to grow you're never going to be in a fear well i might as well take a sword it's time to lay aside these baby childish ideas and come back to being mature adopted sons and daughters of god and let the grace of god grow you in the fear and admonition of god get rid of the pacifier get rid of the diaper bag this ain't a picnic this is a battleground we don't need babies i know we got babies coming in and we welcome them amen but we need men and women who will grow up and be elder who will be real gentile soldiers of the mighty el gabor and we'll fight with everything that's within them well preacher i'm gonna leave and go find the perfect church don't you'll run it because the last five you found were perfect when you left they were imperfect well is that are you here it's not the church heard the pride of god say one day he said sometimes you'll move because of preaching he said then you'll move because of singing he said then you'll move because this he said then you'll realize the problem all along was you [Applause] it's just a whole lot easier to put off on everybody else no matter how well you like it unless it's mixed with personal faith you'll never do no good see so faith wasn't in them that heard the word now the protagonist says in hebrews 4 the seventh verse he said seven is the number of completion three is the number of life seven completion that gives a complete sabbath and again remember he spoke god on this wise spoke of the law on this wise and then again he limited a day he said third day third time hebrews 4 8 for if jesus had given them rest or rest day then would he not afterward and spoke of another day there remaineth therefore a rest which is a sabbath keeping to who to the people of god so they all came out by moses they all heard the same sermons but only two went in the promised land come on friends amen you you've set meetings with people who heard this it's a testimony might as well tell it amen two men read the same book one man got done reading it said that man called me a chicken other man said that strange he called me an eagle amen see because inside of one there was a nature of the word to receive the word amen the bible says lay aside all flirtiness and supernaulity amen of filthiness and receive the engrafted word with meekness which is able to save your soul amen if there's not a heart to receive well i might as well preach if there's a heart heart you'll never receive the word with a heart heart a stone resist but a heart of flesh receives a heart of stone resists and says i ask for brother john that's for the jim and that's where they enter hey remember the heart of flesh says preach the word if it sucks the height off of me preach the word i want to leave here in a body change if you can hear the word and receive the word you will become the word you will rest in the word there remaineth the rest for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased but said there is your key phrase god has ceased from his own works amen the brother said god gave israel the seventh day for the sabbath and commemoration of his own work where he created the world and all that was therein and then he stopped creating are you ready for this he ceased from his labors he rested so when the bible says there will come a sabbath rest are you still with me can i keep going for he that is entered into his rest the prophet of god picks this up and says this entering in is not only an entering in but it is a remaining in the rest it is an eternal rest oh thank god this is not a temporary up one day and down the next i'm on church how men can say thank god he sent us a message that would call us out of laodicea pentecostal babylonian confusion where one day i'm saved and the next day i'm lost and one day i'm going to make it and the next day i'm not i'm on friends you ever been there have you ever come to church i'll tell you what this message will do it'll put a stability in you amen no matter what condition the church is in if this message is in your heart it'll anchor you it'll stabilize you you preachers have been there you preached the people at one service they was on top of the world go back the next service it looked like the world was on top of them do you know why amen because they've never come to a rest they've never come to a place where if the sun is shining amen they're shouting and if the clouds are forming they're pouting but i'm talking about some real rugged believers i'm talking about some believers that don't have to be pampered and they don't have to be petted amen if the whole church is cold they're on fire if ain't nobody shouting they'll break out right in the middle of the service and begin to shout aloud you know why because they found an anchor and they feel a tug from another dimension it's not coming from the flesh it's not coming from the moratorium it's coming from an immortal dementia i'm old church you might as well face it william branham wasn't the only creature of two worlds this message has put you in the same place that a prophet stood [Applause] well you might as well back that devil off of you right now this message has put you between two worlds two dimensions oh god oh god i can't take much time here but it's coming out okay you know what the bible says the bible says it like this there is therefore now no condemnation to who to them that are in christ jesus do you realize amen sometimes in your bible you're going to read the word jesus christ then you're going to read christ jesus let me ask you something what was here first jesus or christ i'll tell you who was here first the christ was because the christ is this okay the christ was the anointing right amen the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word became flesh and we called his name jesus amen then the christ was here amen and jesus was born so when you read in your bible about jesus christ you will read about after the birth but when you read christ jesus you are reading about before the foundation of the world because before there was a body there was a christ which was an anointing which was a logos that would possess the body oh glory to god do you realize where there was no condemnation found in you it was found before the foundation of the world then where does the strength come from to believe is because before you was a sinner you was a son before you was a drinker you was a son of god before you was addicted to pain medicine you was a child of god and when there is no more drugs and there is no more alcohol and there is no more cancer and there is no more sugar diabetes and there is no more painkillers you will still be a son of god lord of god you was connected to an anchor before the foundation of the world you're going to get through you're going to get through you're going to make it i don't care how low you are tonight there is an anchor in an unseen dimension pulling you [Applause] but you might as well square your shoulders back a little bit you got a right to go ahead and tell that devil before i was a slave i was a son before i was addicted to drugs i was addicted to god [Applause] come on before there was one sin imputed unto me i was in the mind of god what is the sabbath rest it is entering in see then thus we see why god could not give us any one certain day of the week we have entered into and do remain in our rest which israel could not do having only a shadow of true substance of what we enjoy so when we receive this rest or the continuing sabbath it is at the invitation of jesus what did he say in matthew 11 28 come into me all ye that are lady and labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest see take my yoke upon you and learn of me how many wants to learn of him for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls now here's what i want to say no matter how long you have been labored under the load of sin whether it is 10 years 20 years or 30 years or 50 years he is inviting you to come with your weird tiring weird and tired weary not weird you're tired and weary life i just went around the world you're tired and weary life and you will find his rest jesus will give you the rest see then what exactly is the rest that jesus will give to whom he said this is the rest wherein you may cause the worry to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear isaiah prophesy to this rest 700 years before it come on the scene 700 years later at pentecost oh god at pentecost this rest come he said what is the rest the rest is the holy ghost thus when they were filled with the holy ghost they ceased from their worldly works their worldly doings their evil ways the holy ghost took charge of their lives they entered into the rest amen that is your sabbath it's not a day it's not a year but the eternity of being filled and blessed with the holy spirit are you ready for this it is you ceasing and god doing it is god in you willing and doing of his good pleasure then see the world right now is crying for this rest the government is looking for rest the politics are looking for rest see they're trying to steal the cry by a religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds and dogmas but failing in that when they can't do it by that then they'll go to drinking then they'll go to corrals and in every physical excess thinking that by worldly pleasures there can be some satisfaction but in such there is no rest now i know that you would think that this next quote doesn't apply to christians but a prophet said it so it's okay i'm going to put my voice with the voice of a prophet and say they smoke and take pills to quieten their nerves well we just might as well deal with it we're here they're racing up all over the world amen well if it's green and it comes from the earth and it's called marijuana it must be okay it is a devil it is a substitute that has been put before the people as an answer to the rest well brother andrew it must be okay because a doctor prescribed the pills amen them doctors don't a bit more care about you amen than the man the moon they're looking at a check that's coming in at the end of the week because of how many prescriptions they wrote i tell you what amen won't you take a pill that'll quieten your nerves it's called the gospel [Applause] now don't think i don't know what i'm talking about i know exactly what i'm talking about a few years ago i was preaching and a young lady was in the meeting and i said what you need to receive is the holy ghost and the holy ghost will take care of that mental condition that the doctors have prescribed you pills for and when i said that she said something in my heart rang out that's the truth she said when i got back to my room she said there was those pills and i looked at them and she said something come out of them pills and said you need me and she said when i heard that voice i give in those pills and i began to take them again and she said i lost everything in two minutes time what god did in the whole service about a year later she come to me she said andrew it was the truth them pills have been destroying my family they've made me numb come on church well i've seen it i've seen piano players get up in churches that's hooked on pain medicine and they're so stoned down their minds they can't even can't even find the right key well the doctor prescribed it what about dr jesus have we forgot he's still a healer have we forgot he can still break the addictions have we forgot he can still be a anchor come on church he well it's a devil some might as well cut its head off amen says you gotta have a pill to get up and you gotta have a pill to go down and you gotta have a peel to stay awake i resent that in the name of jesus christ and i put i put my voice with the voice of my lord when he said come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest you've been wearing yourself out they've been drinking beer and popping pills and watching pornography but there is a rest in the house of god tonight that the weary can find rest that the heavy can find lifting power the holy ghost is the rest can i get a witness can i get a witness will the holy ghost break the addiction will the holy ghost give you joy will the holy ghost give you peace will the holy ghost give you a high this holy ghost that i have the world didn't give it and the world can't take it away this joy that i have it didn't come from the pill it didn't come from a plant it comes from the side of jesus it's called the water and the blood and the spirit [Applause] break out of that addiction break out of that stronghold you don't have to work you don't have to labor another day under drug addiction you don't have to labor another day under lust addictions you don't have to labor another hour under religious traditions [Applause] come on somebody you don't have to work another day for the devil when you hear the word say you're free brother when am i going to be free you are free right now brother andrew i want to be free of this addiction brother andrew can you set me free i can't you know why because 2 000 years ago you were set free what with andrew can you lay my hands can you lay your hands on me so i can be set free i can lay my hands on you but before i laid my hands on you you were already free then what are you doing i'm only praying god would enlighten the eyes of your understanding to the reality he who the son has set free is free indeed come on church we ain't gonna wait till our bodies are changed to rejoice in our freedom i believe as the sons and daughters of god we can shout right here tonight somebody's screaming out we're free we're free we're free let it ring in the front is there any free preachers in the house of god is there any free believers we're free is there any free young people we're free extra extra read all about it i've not lost my mind i'm just a free man i've entered into a rest i'm not working for the devil i'm not working for religion i'm not working for man's ideas i've been set free by the baptism of the holy ghost this is my sabbath this is my rest i'm free you're free he made the promise [Applause] if he was god big enough to make the promise he's got big enough to fulfill it [Applause] [Music] i feel that devil and i'm not scared of him either there is no good life that intimidates me i didn't come from samuel rather sorry i didn't come from saul i come from david you make your boats long enough it'll fall on the ears of a son of god who's not afraid to take a sword and i will take a sword to every demon of depression i will take a sword to every demon of oppression i will take a sword to every man-made tradition around this message that the children of god are not able well brother andrew if they don't hear my tapes and follow my teachings then they're not a part of the bride take that nonsense back to hell where it comes from there is one man's tapes that andrew glover is obligated to listen to and it's a man named william marion branham i love my brethren my minister and brethren but i'll stay with what a prophet said in the face of ever goliath i refuse to help bring more instability to the children of god by some theory of some man that has no foundation to back it up on [Music] i'm not standing on what a man said i'm resting solely upon thus saith the lord and the word said that the mind of god would be in the bride and she would have the word and she would know what he wants done with his word the holy ghost is the rest it's not a drink it's not a peel are you ready for this it's not no earthly potion they need jesus they need the heavenly remedy the rest of the spirit amen this is not can i go a step further this is not just a religious rest oh my hey man lotta okay say lonnie i might as well preach i'm here a lot of people got a religious rest they just they just brother donny says change the baptist book for a message book and change the pentecostal idea for a message idea amen and they're religiously miserable yeah i appreciate people all the time service went too long speakers was too loud seats were too hard preachers shouted too much they danced too much they sweated too much hey man you know what if i wasn't born again i'd be miserable like that too but you know why i'm not miserable it's because i have had an acts 238 holy ghost experience i have stood on the backside of the desert and the same purifier that moses and paul and william branham met i have met him for myself i am not a cold formal handshake and mental conception child i am a hollering screaming babbard tongue talking holy ghost dancing pentecostal rays son of god who is entered into a rest somebody said preacher somebody told me one time said with andrew you shout too much i remember being about an eight nine year old boy i sit on the front row and when i heard the word i stood up remember somebody come to me one time they said once you calm down message person say won't you calm down i said well i don't i can't calm down i enjoy the house of god they said one day you'll get a little bit older and you'll get a little bit more revelation and you won't jump up every

down and the prophet said while the battle was going on you know what he said brother on he said rahab and her family who was under the token was in there reading the scriptures they were not running

you will be young again the believers rest can i invite you tonight can i can i put my voice with the voice of jesus and say come unto him you know why you ain't shouted in so long as cause you wore out you're so tired by trying to figure it out that when you hear the word you can't shout because it's already been figured out all right i pray that makes sense let me let me rephrase that like this you're wore out because you're trying to find the solution and the word's already got the solution you ever go to the car garage mechanic shop walk in there normally you'll see a sign on there it says

the day jesus was crucified he said the paschal lamb become ineffective and lamb of god christ become the effective one he said in the day the nomination crucified this word he said is the day with her creeds is the day denominationalism become ineffective and it's then from then from now the word and the word only and he said the word come into full effect and i love how he says that on the end

noah was at rest in safety in the ark of god the plagues the plagues was falling all around him but noah climbed up in the ark and he was at rest heard the prophet of god tell it today about the man's son who come out looking for a wife he said she didn't think she was worth it worth it she was trying to work and do everything she could oh god thank you jesus he said all the other ladies heard that there was a rich man's son coming looking for a wife so they went out and began to work they began to try to get all fancied up and get all painted up and pick out the newest outfits and brother
