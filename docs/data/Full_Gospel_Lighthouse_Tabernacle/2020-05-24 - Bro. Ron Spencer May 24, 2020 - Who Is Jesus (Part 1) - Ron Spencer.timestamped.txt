[59:36] I / have the strength to speak my
[59:40] strength is limited I wish you could all
[59:43] come to my house but there will come a
[59:45] day where we'll have a picnic together
[59:46] and we'll try to get that fixed up and
[59:49] and they're limited in my company and
[59:52] you understand all of those things and a
[59:54] lot of preachers would like to come in

[59:58] not it's just not it I'm just not at
[1:00:01] that spot yet so we we thank you and
[1:00:04] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[1:00:06] difficult things that happen and and
[1:00:08] they happen almost daily but we we are
[1:00:12] glad that we can stand here yesterday
[1:00:15] morning we had a I had a seizure and
[1:00:17] that caused the whole day to be upset so
[1:00:20] I'm hoping not to have one here this
[1:00:22] morning but but I am you know if you
[1:00:26] just lay on the bed all the time the
[1:00:29] enemy gets the credit so I just might as
[1:00:32] well whip him while I can
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:43] I have a statement I'd like to make
[1:00:47] he hates me and I hate him we want to be
[1:00:52] real clear with that brother Steve he
[1:00:56] hates me and I hate him amen amen
[1:01:01] I'd like to speak to you today and maybe
[1:01:05] in a couple of weeks carry it on and I'd
[1:01:10] like to speak on who is Jesus and it may
[1:01:16] say seem simple for a few minutes but I
[1:01:18] got a feel and it's gonna get more
[1:01:20] complex than you would imagine because
[1:01:23] sometimes we think we know him and we
[1:01:25] don't we're acquainted with him and were
[1:01:30] not we're standing real within feet of
[1:01:34] him and we don't recognize him so do we
[1:01:42] really know him I think this is going to
[1:01:47] be good John chapter 1 and verse 1 can
[1:01:53] you hear me okay in the beginning what's
[1:01:58] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:02:01] the Word was God the same was in the
[1:02:06] beginning with God and all things were
[1:02:10] made by him and without him was not
[1:02:13] anything that was made that was made in
[1:02:17] him was life and the life was the light
[1:02:21] of men and the light shineth in darkness
[1:02:25] and the darkness comprehended that not
[1:02:29] so you could be so close and miss him
[1:02:34] and there was a man sent from God whose
[1:02:37] name was John and the same comfort came
[1:02:41] for a witness to bear witness of the
[1:02:43] light then all men through him might
[1:02:48] believe he was not that light but was
[1:02:52] sent to bear witness
[1:02:54] of that light that was the true light
[1:02:59] which lighteth every man that cometh
[1:03:04] into the world and he was in the world
[1:03:07] and the world was made by him and the
[1:03:13] world knew him not he came into his own
[1:03:18] and his own received him not
[1:03:23] I like this next part but as many as
[1:03:27] received him to them gave he power to
[1:03:30] become the sons of God to them that
[1:03:33] believe on his name which were born not
[1:03:37] of blood nor the will of the flesh nor
[1:03:40] the will of man but of God
[1:03:43] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:03:49] us and we beheld his glory the glory is
[1:03:53] the only begotten of the Father full of
[1:03:56] grace and truth very familiar portion of
[1:04:02] Scripture and I read it to you in Luke
[1:04:04] chapter 9 and verse 18 and it came to
[1:04:08] pass as as they were alone a long
[1:04:12] praying and his his staples came Worth
[1:04:15] were with him and he asked them who say
[1:04:20] the people that I am and Jesus answering
[1:04:24] and they answered him saying John the
[1:04:28] Baptist and and some saying Elias and
[1:04:31] others saying one of the old prophets
[1:04:33] old prophets is risen again and he said
[1:04:38] unto them but who say ye but who say you
[1:04:48] than I am and Peter answering said the
[1:04:53] Christ of God you may be seated
[1:05:09] brother Brendan says now a lot of people
[1:05:13] have the wrong impression of Christ some
[1:05:18] people think that that Christ was a
[1:05:20] Christ was the greatest of all men
[1:05:27] he was an example man not only was he a
[1:05:33] man but he was God man he was God with
[1:05:40] us Emmanuel he was the humblest of all
[1:05:45] men but you can be too humble you can
[1:05:52] get so humble until until the devil
[1:05:56] would make a puppet out of you he was
[1:06:01] humble enough to to allow them to watch
[1:06:06] his feet he was forgiving enough to pray
[1:06:12] for those who drove spikes in his hands
[1:06:18] but he was man enough to plant ropes and
[1:06:24] run the money changers out of the house
[1:06:28] of God many times we come to church and
[1:06:33] we should ask ourselves this question
[1:06:38] did we see God or did we see man
[1:06:46] sometimes
[1:06:47] we should be asked the question look
[1:06:50] past what you see fake past what you
[1:06:56] think have faith beyond the realms of
[1:07:01] your senses many people never believed
[1:07:07] Mary's story of an angel of the Lord
[1:07:11] coming to her but there was a king that
[1:07:15] was getting ready to come to the earth
[1:07:17] we're just before Memorial Day and in
[1:07:22] this Memorial Day it's a day of
[1:07:24] remembrance to remember that there's
[1:07:27] been many battles lots of scars across
[1:07:31] this young nation of ours we are in an
[1:07:36] interesting and if even a very strange
[1:07:39] time we're in an election here where
[1:07:46] people have different various opinions
[1:07:49] willing to fight over them willing to
[1:07:52] politicize it we're willing to do
[1:07:55] whatever it takes to get their opinion
[1:07:57] across whether it will be virtual media
[1:08:01] or whatever it will be they will try
[1:08:05] their best to project their the thoughts
[1:08:08] and their opinions kingdoms have risen
[1:08:13] and kingdoms of fell Caesar Pharaoh
[1:08:19] Alexander they thought that they had
[1:08:22] incredible kingdoms they thought they
[1:08:25] had a lot of answers to different
[1:08:28] situations we look back at our great
[1:08:32] precedence whether it be George
[1:08:34] Washington or Abraham Lincoln we've had
[1:08:39] a Roosevelt's we we've had her Hoover's
[1:08:43] we've had her Bill Clinton's we've we've
[1:08:46] had them they stood and had great speech
[1:08:50] makers that stood down they were doing
[1:08:55] trying to do their best one of my
[1:08:59] favorite
[1:09:00] was a man named teddy and he went around
[1:09:03] the world one year given a speech I'd
[1:09:08] like to preach on that in a couple of
[1:09:10] weeks if I can men think that they have
[1:09:16] an answer they're looking for an answer
[1:09:21] for a plague this is an invisible war
[1:09:28] it's an invisible war ninety seven
[1:09:32] thousand of us Americans has perished in
[1:09:35] this war that's the size of one of the
[1:09:39] hugest football Coliseum's has died and
[1:09:43] many times that has been afflicted with
[1:09:47] the disease that you can't see and
[1:09:51] almost overnight you're afflicted thank
[1:09:55] God for those that are on the front line
[1:09:58] that is fighting that war
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:03] [Music]
[1:10:10] why are we here this morning because
[1:10:14] we're preparing to be a part of a
[1:10:17] citizenship a citizenship unlike
[1:10:22] anything this world has ever seen
[1:10:26] perfect peace perfect harmony
[1:10:32] we're built for that Kingdom to live in
[1:10:38] for the for the world they had great
[1:10:41] complexes about being shut-in
[1:10:44] but for the bride of Jesus Christ we're
[1:10:47] actually built for that we have a token
[1:10:52] over our home we have our God to take
[1:10:56] care of us we're believing for the best
[1:10:59] and even if we get sick we have a high
[1:11:02] physician are you with me I enjoyed over
[1:11:09] the last I'm going to be in quarantine
[1:11:11] for a while but mom's gonna be longer
[1:11:14] than 14 days but I think it's been about
[1:11:17] 19 weeks so far I've enjoyed being with
[1:11:20] my best friend I married her hallelujah
[1:11:25] I hope you're finding when you're you're
[1:11:29] you shut-in that you actually love your
[1:11:32] wife you've got a lot of things in
[1:11:35] common with her and you're enjoying the
[1:11:39] company enjoying family meals together
[1:11:47] we're built for this
[1:11:51] in this thoughts I'd like to just kind
[1:11:56] of begin by saying this did you
[1:11:59] entertain Jesus during this time
[1:12:07] through the Scriptures they would ask
[1:12:11] who is this Jesus they of all people
[1:12:17] should have known who he was they'd been
[1:12:19] looking for him since Abraham every
[1:12:27] prophet had a part of Jesus in him and
[1:12:33] when Jesus came on the scene he didn't
[1:12:36] come as a king he came as a baby and he
[1:12:42] began to grow up and this Jesus was
[1:12:44] among them Jesus is a baby in a manger
[1:12:49] Jesus is a child in Egypt Jesus being
[1:12:55] left with the doctors and the
[1:12:57] philosophers and the astronomers and
[1:13:01] actually when Jesus got finished talking
[1:13:05] they wanted to worship Him and even when
[1:13:10] Mary came back and forgot who Jesus was
[1:13:13] and denied the supernatural birth jesus
[1:13:20] corrected the error that she spake and
[1:13:26] said I am about my father's business he
[1:13:34] knew who he was he came with the mission
[1:13:39] of the earth knowing who he was today if
[1:13:45] we knew who he was we would not be so
[1:13:48] shaken our nation thinks that they know
[1:13:53] who Jesus is but they are so shaken they
[1:13:57] think they're looking for an answer but
[1:14:01] their pulpits are weak they've weakened
[1:14:06] their pulpits they took him out of their
[1:14:09] schools they took him out of their
[1:14:11] government they took him out of their
[1:14:14] halls of justice
[1:14:18] that's the reason America has became a
[1:14:21] weak nation it's they forgot who Jesus
[1:14:26] really is let me just say this to you if
[1:14:38] you ever meet Jesus you'll never be the
[1:14:40] same if you'll ever meet Jesus you will
[1:14:45] never have need Alcoholics Anonymous
[1:14:47] again in your life if you ever meet
[1:14:50] Jesus there will be no going back if you
[1:14:56] ever really meet him and he changes your
[1:15:00] life all your experiences will be much
[1:15:02] different one from another and it'll be
[1:15:05] personal in your life but if you ever
[1:15:08] meet the Jesus of this message many
[1:15:12] people meet this message but they don't
[1:15:14] meet the Jesus of it they meet pairs of
[1:15:18] personalities of ministers and fall in
[1:15:21] love with those personalities and follow
[1:15:24] it that way it's good to have strong
[1:15:27] personalities in the message and good to
[1:15:30] have strong preachers in the message but
[1:15:33] this message is more than about William
[1:15:35] Branham it's more than about our
[1:15:38] favorite preachers it's more than about
[1:15:42] our favorite quotes this message is
[1:15:46] Jesus Christ in word form in life form
[1:15:51] in action form this message is Jesus
[1:15:57] living in 2020
[1:16:10] it'll cause a lot of reactions sometimes
[1:16:18] when Jesus comes on your hands people
[1:16:20] want to wash him they quickly want to
[1:16:24] wash Jesus but you can't escape him
[1:16:28] you can't escape this Jesus Pilate knew
[1:16:35] that he met somebody greater than him
[1:16:39] Herod knew that he met somebody greater
[1:16:42] than him because his presence was
[1:16:45] greater and they knew it why did the
[1:16:54] church world so hate him then and why
[1:16:59] did they hate him now it might be a
[1:17:04] great question to ask I know this is a
[1:17:09] different style of Ron Spencer preaching
[1:17:12] but this is what we got but I've got a
[1:17:17] feeling in hell they're very
[1:17:21] disappointed that I'm able to do
[1:17:23] anything
[1:17:35] when Jesus stood there and said I'm a
[1:17:39] I'm from above and you're from beneath
[1:17:45] I'd say that that didn't make a whole
[1:17:47] lot of friends we need Ben aside your
[1:17:51] fathers were in the wilderness yes they
[1:17:56] were but there everyone did they miss
[1:18:02] the message of their day from your
[1:18:06] churches you whited the walls of the
[1:18:08] Sepulcher
[1:18:10] I'd say that they wanted to wash their
[1:18:14] hands of Jesus dude
[1:18:16] they built seminaries without him huge
[1:18:21] schools without him all they hang his
[1:18:26] picture today but they'd be ashamed to
[1:18:32] have Jesus at their home they've got
[1:18:36] ashamed to have Jesus sitting across the
[1:18:40] table when he can look through you and
[1:18:42] he knows you know Jesus had strange
[1:18:47] friends you would think that that Jesus
[1:18:58] being the king of kings and the Lord of
[1:19:00] lords would not get hungry but he did
[1:19:07] you would think he would not get tired
[1:19:10] but he did you would think she would not
[1:19:15] curse a tree but he did this Jesus when
[1:19:21] he wanted to eat some of his best
[1:19:26] friends were married Martha and a man
[1:19:29] named Lazarus it was a place where he
[1:19:33] hung alt I'd like for my home to be a
[1:19:36] hangout where Jesus would feel
[1:19:38] comfortable that
[1:19:40] maybe maybe we you know we can think of
[1:19:44] it but maybe he would go to the home of
[1:19:47] the woman at the well after the change
[1:19:51] and he would feel comfortable at her
[1:19:54] home and people would come in and he
[1:19:57] would talk about the parables it isn't
[1:20:00] all written in the book brother Denis
[1:20:03] but he would tell us he would tell us
[1:20:06] many things one day he would he would
[1:20:10] call him and out of a tree today I want
[1:20:14] to eat with you you see they would say
[1:20:20] that he has dinner with sin us I'd like
[1:20:28] for him to have dinner with me songs
[1:20:37] poems pictures they have all been
[1:20:44] written about him painted of him I've
[1:20:48] read this to you before he came from the
[1:20:52] bosom of the Father and the bosom of a
[1:20:55] woman he put on humanity that we could
[1:21:00] put on divinity he become the son of a
[1:21:05] man that we might become the sons of God
[1:21:08] he came from heaven where rivers never
[1:21:12] freeze winds never blow Frost's never
[1:21:18] chills the air flowers will never fade
[1:21:24] where no one is ever sick I like a place
[1:21:27] like that don't you
[1:21:29] there's not an undertaker there there's
[1:21:32] not a graveyard on any Hill no one ever
[1:21:37] dies and no one ever is buried
[1:21:44] he was born contrary to the laws of
[1:21:46] nature
[1:21:48] he lived in poverty and reared in
[1:21:51] obscurity and crossed the boundary of
[1:21:53] land only once in his childhood he had
[1:21:57] no wealth he had no influence no
[1:22:01] training no formal education his
[1:22:05] relatives who was inconspicuous and not
[1:22:09] influential in infancy he startled the
[1:22:14] king in boyhood he puzzled the wise men
[1:22:19] in manhood he ruled in the course of
[1:22:23] nature he cruel he walked across the
[1:22:26] billows high special men and their wise
[1:22:30] men in manhood he ruled the course of
[1:22:34] nature He healed the multitudes without
[1:22:41] medicine I'd like to say his hands was
[1:22:46] dr. sands in his hands a dead girl could
[1:22:52] raise and live tell a walk a healthy
[1:22:54] life again are you with me now I would
[1:22:59] say sitting in our audiences we have
[1:23:02] felt the hands of this Jesus are you
[1:23:09] with me we have felt his nurturing hands
[1:23:12] reach and touch us wipe the tears from
[1:23:15] her eyes Paterson our backs covered us
[1:23:20] in her fear and our torment and remind
[1:23:24] us that he still our great intercessor
[1:23:29] he's still our healer he's still our
[1:23:33] covered up he's not 10,000 miles away
[1:23:46] he never founded the college yet all the
[1:23:50] schools together cannot boast of as many
[1:23:54] students as he has he never Marcille
[1:24:00] dander me drafted a soldier fired a gun
[1:24:06] yet no leader ever made had more
[1:24:11] volunteers who under his orders made
[1:24:17] rebel stack their arms of surrender
[1:24:21] without a shot being fired so I would
[1:24:26] say on this Memorial Day we have a
[1:24:29] five-star general that we remember to
[1:24:34] not and I read that with purpose I am
[1:24:42] honored
[1:24:43] I am honored beyond honor to be called
[1:24:50] one of the generals in the army of the
[1:24:57] Lord
[1:25:02] I am honored
[1:25:25] but the homer would sing the song I'm a
[1:25:29] soldier in the army of the Lord when I
[1:25:34] die I'm gonna go down fighting in the
[1:25:37] army of the Lord CS Lewis would say it
[1:25:43] like this when I die may all hell know
[1:25:52] that it's been a fight hallelujah he is
[1:26:01] despised and rejected of men a man of
[1:26:04] sorrows acquainted with grief as we hit
[1:26:07] his where her face is from him he was
[1:26:11] despised and we esteemed him not
[1:26:14] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:26:16] carried our sorrows acquainted with
[1:26:21] grief
[1:26:31] there isn't nothing and he hasn't been
[1:26:36] acquainted with
[1:26:56] he has on me he had power to say these
[1:27:08] words I have power to lay my life down
[1:27:14] hearty heat it up again so he has power
[1:27:23] to carry us through some real difficult
[1:27:32] times everybody doesn't get a warning
[1:27:43] that they're gonna go through a trial
[1:27:45] like I was given warning I was gonna go
[1:27:49] through but he gave me ammunition after
[1:27:55] ammunition but the greatest ammunition
[1:27:58] he gave me was his word that I could
[1:28:03] hold on to every day and a family around
[1:28:08] me that would remind me of his word
[1:28:20] forgive me I don't know how many would
[1:28:24] see this and get bored and click off the
[1:28:28] channel but it doesn't mind I'm not
[1:28:30] really interested I'm really not
[1:28:33] interested
[1:28:38] I was thinking Jesus as he was there and
[1:28:46] he asked them whom the men say that I am
[1:28:54] that would that would come kind of like
[1:28:57] it has came today in the revealing of
[1:29:01] the son of a man and he and when brother
[1:29:11] Branham came to this area then they
[1:29:14] didn't know who he was
[1:29:19] you see if they do recognize who he was
[1:29:24] we'd have a cathedral on this hill that
[1:29:27] would go all of the way to the road but
[1:29:34] too many he was just another healing
[1:29:36] evangelists and they really must who he
[1:29:40] was but the Branham spokes five sermons
[1:29:44] on who is Jesus and he'll name one who
[1:29:50] is God in a cup and three of them and
[1:29:54] then who is Jesus especially in two of
[1:29:57] them missus men breakfast was what most
[1:30:02] of them were and he would stand before
[1:30:06] them and he would use this simple topic
[1:30:09] to talk about who is Jesus
[1:30:14] you can feel it why such a simple topic
[1:30:20] why don't you preach something neat to
[1:30:23] us he would say it later just by just by
[1:30:29] a couple sermons we'd like to figure out
[1:30:33] you know you know how to have miracles
[1:30:37] in and he he would explain that how can
[1:30:42] I teach you algebra when you don't even
[1:30:48] know you're a beast
[1:30:49] cease and he would break that down as
[1:30:54] always believe Christ before preach in a
[1:31:01] series that would be the greatest ever
[1:31:04] the seals he would preach God hidden and
[1:31:10] revealed in simplicity sometimes when
[1:31:16] we're looking for a great formula for
[1:31:19] success it is so simple just live the
[1:31:27] message just be there at the right time
[1:31:33] and at the right place brother on how
[1:31:39] how does it operate did you believe your
[1:31:47] mother when she told you your name did
[1:31:55] you trust her when he told you I forgive
[1:32:02] you of your sins go and sin no more
[1:32:07] or you had tried religion before maybe
[1:32:12] you tried and failed and tried and
[1:32:15] failed but when you really met Jesus in
[1:32:18] that moment whether lightning struck or
[1:32:22] where you saw a lot but you just know
[1:32:25] when you really met him you walked away
[1:32:28] from that event and you felt like you
[1:32:31] were cleansed and you would never be the
[1:32:35] same ever again and there wasn't a devil
[1:32:39] in hell could convince you away from
[1:32:40] that
[1:32:51] sometimes when you're looking at deep
[1:32:53] mysteries of God and God just one day
[1:32:58] opens up the page for you and you go I
[1:33:00] say something and you've read it all
[1:33:03] your life and they just opens it up and
[1:33:08] you go honey
[1:33:10] I've never seen this before but God just
[1:33:14] reveals something to me and I've not
[1:33:17] seen it I've read this a thousand times
[1:33:21] I've read it a thousand times and I've
[1:33:25] not seen it baptism in the name of the
[1:33:29] Lord Jesus Christ and you've read it a
[1:33:31] thousand times but today you realize
[1:33:35] it's more than a recipe for baptism but
[1:33:39] it's the marriage covenant for Jesus
[1:33:43] Christ and it's the way that he fills
[1:33:47] you with his 'el your life and he seals
[1:33:51] you and he says your mind and you can
[1:34:01] read it to people and they never see it
[1:34:02] I wrote some interesting notes this
[1:34:10] morning you know the Jesus that lived
[1:34:18] 2,000 years ago came and lived inside of
[1:34:24] a redeemed man and that man would go on
[1:34:30] hunting trips with some of the most
[1:34:35] cruel people in the world
[1:34:37] BIRT called for one and this man had
[1:34:42] such a presence that that man saw Jesus
[1:34:49] and it changed his life
[1:34:53] in the last months of the brother
[1:34:56] branham's life he goes to a place you
[1:34:59] won't hear this many times but bread the
[1:35:02] brennaman still at hunting
[1:35:03] check out wood for a family and the man
[1:35:08] was a constant smoker and he was sitting
[1:35:11] on the porch with he told him what a
[1:35:14] millionaire that he was and led him to
[1:35:17] Christ brother branham as a younger man
[1:35:22] would stand in an infidel yard and pick
[1:35:28] up an apple that the bees was eating up
[1:35:33] that man that Haiti preachers all of his
[1:35:36] life but he'd never met Jesus sometimes
[1:35:42] we want to change men with philosophy
[1:35:45] but if we haven't don't have Jesus in
[1:35:48] our lives hurry with me doctors met
[1:35:55] Jesus over the last few months they
[1:36:00] proclaimed that they met Jesus over the
[1:36:02] last few months I heard them talk about
[1:36:05] the Jesus that was in the room over the
[1:36:10] last couple of months and I never
[1:36:13] preached a sermon I never hardly quoted
[1:36:18] a scripture but every one of them
[1:36:21] testified that he was in the room
[1:36:35] all your Jesus that lives on the inside
[1:36:38] of you will have characters around you
[1:36:41] like Jesus had Jesus had leaders around
[1:36:50] him Pilate Herod and Herod was known to
[1:36:59] be the greatest one of the greatest of
[1:37:04] all orators and there he was feet away
[1:37:15] and he missed Jesus there be people
[1:37:21] within feet of him that would be the
[1:37:25] rich rich young ruler if they really
[1:37:30] caught who you were coming to you now if
[1:37:37] they really caught who you were they'd
[1:37:40] respect you like never before but just
[1:37:51] as a rich young ruler they walk away
[1:37:54] from you like I walked away from Jesus
[1:38:01] all of us loved the believer that
[1:38:04] surround us the affection that I felt
[1:38:08] that I walked out of the into this room
[1:38:12] that's worth more than millions of
[1:38:14] dollars someone told me the other day
[1:38:20] that they believed I was one of the most
[1:38:22] loved men in the world I'll take that
[1:38:26] compliment and I appreciate the
[1:38:30] compliment but
[1:38:34] to get a friend you're gonna be a friend
[1:38:40] I'm not to identify with this part a
[1:38:45] believer
[1:38:51] I heard brother Homer preach a lot of
[1:38:54] funeral sermons but the funeral sermon
[1:39:00] that we'll always love that Homer
[1:39:01] preached was this man the believer
[1:39:13] the believer this woman the believer
[1:39:23] that's quite a statement without a whole
[1:39:28] lot being said the believer Jesus could
[1:39:34] turn and say that you were a believer
[1:39:42] Jesus also had some other characters in
[1:39:45] these in his life he had scoffers he had
[1:39:53] critics without saying a man you do too
[1:40:03] he had a Judas in his life
[1:40:16] sometimes we get things written about us
[1:40:23] that hurt our feelings that are scars to
[1:40:28] our life sister Connie that's difficult
[1:40:32] you don't know why people say what they
[1:40:35] do but that must be I'd like to tell you
[1:40:45] the critics in your life they must be
[1:40:49] there
[1:40:50] the critic stored the message they have
[1:40:54] to be there the critic stored Jesus they
[1:40:58] had to be there but the believers had to
[1:41:02] be there too are you with me I wrote a
[1:41:09] note down this morning what will you do
[1:41:11] with your twenty or thirty pieces of
[1:41:13] silver if that's what you get for hating
[1:41:20] this message and throwing your life away
[1:41:26] how will you spend your twenty to thirty
[1:41:29] pieces of silver is this what I get out
[1:41:34] of turning the message down my marriage
[1:41:38] falling apart my children going every
[1:41:45] whichaway
[1:41:45] I thought it would be different oh no
[1:41:52] that's what you get for turning Jesus
[1:41:54] down that that's the payment there's
[1:41:58] always a payment that goes with it
[1:42:01] there's ropes on these pews but what you
[1:42:04] don't realize when you turn Jesus down
[1:42:07] there's a rope around your neck
[1:42:21] maybe someone listens to that today and
[1:42:24] they said well brother Ron was talking
[1:42:27] about me thank God that it was while you
[1:42:31] still got breath in your lungs while you
[1:42:36] still got breath and there's a chance
[1:42:38] for you to turn it around get over your
[1:42:42] petty feelings get over it
[1:42:47] [Applause]
[1:43:03] people walk away from Jesus from for the
[1:43:07] silliest things they walk away hey
[1:43:11] listen I'm I can speak and you don't
[1:43:15] know how much longer I have in my life
[1:43:17] but I'm just gonna speak plainly from
[1:43:19] this point forward listen I'm just a
[1:43:25] representative of this message I'm a
[1:43:28] billboard of this message I'm a sound of
[1:43:32] this message listen the brother man
[1:43:35] preach sermons true sound overlooked I'm
[1:43:38] a sign that this message is still alive
[1:43:42] and it's well
[1:43:53] me standing in this pulpit today is a
[1:43:57] voice that says God can bring a man
[1:44:02] through brain cancer and he can still
[1:44:05] stand in the pulpit and still preach the
[1:44:08] gospel of Jesus Christ I'm a sign that
[1:44:14] this message works
[1:44:15] [Applause]
[1:44:41] inquiring minds want to know
[1:44:44] sob what just tell you my doctor told me
[1:44:49] the other day said sister gone I asked
[1:44:55] her what's the crystal ball for my
[1:44:57] future of my months and the future may
[1:45:01] be years in front of me she said how do
[1:45:03] you feel now and I said well I'm very
[1:45:06] weak she said well we're going to
[1:45:08] continue to pour chemo into your body
[1:45:10] and you'll get weaker and weaker one day
[1:45:14] you'll have to make a choice I don't
[1:45:15] want to take that no more but you'll get
[1:45:17] weaker and weaker so you're probably at
[1:45:19] your best right now I came home I wrote
[1:45:22] Andrew and said I'll be preaching Sunday
[1:45:24] morning if this is as strong as I get
[1:45:29] I'll preach and if it's 2 or 3 weeks
[1:45:33] from now I'll preach again are you
[1:45:36] listening
[1:45:37] can you give me that can you give me
[1:45:41] that
[1:45:53] they thought I would get more out of
[1:45:55] selling Jesus out no you didn't
[1:46:00] negotiate the deal that Elvis Presley
[1:46:02] did Elvis Presley sold him out and
[1:46:08] became a rock and roll star yeah and he
[1:46:19] had a castle and had women and he had
[1:46:23] and he had planes but you sold that way
[1:46:27] too cheap oh but I just turned on the
[1:46:34] Heather I turned on Jason oh no no no
[1:46:42] you turned on Jesus you just didn't
[1:46:47] recognize who Jesus was
[1:46:52] I turned on Steve I turned on Jeff you
[1:46:58] didn't recognize who Jesus was steve was
[1:47:03] one of those powerful men that said in
[1:47:05] this church but i'm sure he had his
[1:47:08] critics and I'm sure even as he was
[1:47:12] fighting in ALS that his critic said you
[1:47:17] know if God really healed he'd heal a
[1:47:20] great man like Steve but what you didn't
[1:47:23] realize at the end of the journey God
[1:47:26] gives him a body
[1:47:35] oh I want to say for my part it's been
[1:47:56] worth it I want to finish this sermon
[1:48:03] this morning and I know it's simple but
[1:48:07] I want to really say I'm glad I met
[1:48:09] Jesus I'm glad I met the Jesus of this
[1:48:16] Bible I'm glad I met the Jesus of this
[1:48:19] message brother bill I'm glad that you
[1:48:34] prayed with me that night at the altar
[1:48:38] you may not remember that but I'm glad
[1:48:41] you spent that time at the altar and
[1:48:43] prayed with me
[1:48:44] I knew quotes and I knew scriptures but
[1:48:47] I didn't know Jesus young people you may
[1:48:55] be sitting here this morning and yeah
[1:49:00] and you know you know a lot about the
[1:49:02] message but you don't know Jesus maybe
[1:49:06] you don't even know why we are going to
[1:49:08] go neck under to continue with Sunday
[1:49:10] morning services and your you know but
[1:49:12] it don't fit my schedule I could care
[1:49:15] less about your schedule
[1:49:28] one of the reasons is because I'm strong
[1:49:31] in the morning than the evening I'm very
[1:49:34] weak and so I asked Andrew to continue
[1:49:37] the Sunday morning services and if you
[1:49:41] want to tussle with that you probably
[1:49:44] need to meet Jesus anyway yeah can I
[1:50:00] just give you one more statement this
[1:50:02] morning
[1:50:09] if you don't believe this Jesus why
[1:50:13] don't you just go as Satan he knows who
[1:50:18] he is he knows who he is
[1:50:26] he's been whipped by him every day
[1:50:32] and 100% sure he knows who Jesus is but
[1:50:39] I'd like to ask God today that God would
[1:50:45] feel every fiber of my being and your
[1:50:50] being with the Jesus of this word and
[1:50:57] feel a life like never before but this
[1:51:05] Jesus of Christ but the realm would come
[1:51:13] to the spot and he would say are you the
[1:51:17] patients yes yes you can see it on deep
[1:51:23] calleth through the deep yes I can I can
[1:51:28] see you're nervous I can see you're
[1:51:32] emotional oh boy I can't see it I can't
[1:51:36] see that I i watch closely
[1:51:44] standing between you and eyes is him I
[1:51:53] don't know you we've never met before in
[1:51:56] our lives and in the just a few moments
[1:52:01] he begins to tell the story of the woman
[1:52:03] at the well and brother Harold before
[1:52:06] long he comes across that audience and
[1:52:09] you've stopped from this patient he'll
[1:52:11] point 14 out I counted it the other day
[1:52:16] brother William
[1:52:18] 14 people in a row he called them by
[1:52:21] name right down the line counted them
[1:52:27] counted it by name told them every one
[1:52:31] of their conditions let me tell you
[1:52:34] another part of that story in the
[1:52:37] evening service he comes back and he
[1:52:44] preaches another hour and a half and he
[1:52:47] comes and he prays for a couple of
[1:52:49] people and he goes across the aisle and
[1:52:53] goes all the way down through that aisle
[1:52:55] and tells all of their needs who is this
[1:53:04] Jesus I'm not talking about brother
[1:53:10] Branham but they walked out of that
[1:53:13] building and were never the same ever
[1:53:16] again I just read just before I came to
[1:53:22] the pulpit brother Branham was taken to
[1:53:25] an ambulance and the woman had kicked
[1:53:28] the windows out of the out of the
[1:53:31] ambulance before she had been in an
[1:53:34] institution for ten years and when
[1:53:41] brother got it brother Branham got
[1:53:42] finished he took tolling said go ahead
[1:53:44] and take her back to the institution but
[1:53:47] when she came to of the next morning she
[1:53:49] was different she didn't need to be an
[1:53:51] institution no more she went home
[1:53:53] clothed in a right mind
[1:53:57] and brother Brown who said the son of
[1:54:00] that family came to him and told him
[1:54:03] mama's different are you with me and
[1:54:16] that person would walk off for that a
[1:54:18] completely different individual then
[1:54:24] they'd walk off a complete different
[1:54:26] individual they they came into the
[1:54:31] presence of a God not the man we don't
[1:54:37] worship the man but they came in the
[1:54:39] presence of God when you read this
[1:54:42] message and when you really read it
[1:54:44] brother Benny you've been student of
[1:54:47] this message for many many years and you
[1:54:52] have I have had a special project going
[1:54:54] on even in China and there's brothers
[1:54:58] that are in prison now and may be in
[1:55:02] prison for a long long time and we are
[1:55:04] praying that they're out of prison we'll
[1:55:06] get out of prison listen we sit here
[1:55:09] today and we've been nine weeks without
[1:55:11] Church how many's missed that there's
[1:55:20] situations going on in China now they'll
[1:55:23] never have service ever again never
[1:55:26] they'll never be able to have service
[1:55:28] ever again but they say that as
[1:55:31] believers they're stronger than they've
[1:55:34] ever been through thought this last week
[1:55:38] Russia has condemned the message and
[1:55:41] their brothers and sisters under
[1:55:44] persecution it's been called the illegal
[1:55:47] material now that they no doubt what
[1:55:51] will happen to some of those churches
[1:55:53] and those pastors we need to pray for
[1:55:55] them but this Jesus made us a promise
[1:55:59] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:56:03] you but I'll be with you to the end
[1:56:10] this Jesus made us a promise you'll come
[1:56:13] back for us John 14 in verse 6 and I
[1:56:22] want to leave you with the scripture I
[1:56:24] am the way boy this is a simple sermon
[1:56:36] issue is I have to agree with you it
[1:56:42] sure is des it live does it live for
[1:56:53] those that are watching by way of
[1:56:55] internet and you're going well brother
[1:56:57] Ron's washed up now he's going to preach
[1:57:06] more simple than he's ever preached in
[1:57:08] his life and I've just preached to you
[1:57:11] one of the most couple complex sermons
[1:57:17] does your neighbors see Jesus this the
[1:57:24] guy at work see Jesus
[1:57:37] the community do they see Jesus so this
[1:57:50] sermon just became more complex than you
[1:57:52] ever thought because I'm really not
[1:57:56] talking about the Jesus of two thousand
[1:57:58] years ago or even the one that lived in
[1:58:02] William Branham but the real Jesus is
[1:58:07] the one that lives in Katie and Katie
[1:58:16] and lives in you Deloris and lives in
[1:58:21] you Terry because it's easy to point
[1:58:24] there and there and there and there but
[1:58:27] did you meet Jesus who is the Jesus that
[1:58:32] lives in her life as a teenager you
[1:58:37] won't offer her drugs you won't really
[1:58:45] ask about why she even dresses the way
[1:58:47] that she does she's different
[1:58:54] why is that teacher that way because
[1:58:59] they met Jesus listen I'm not an
[1:59:03] apologetic Christian I don't know I am
[1:59:08] NOT an apologetic Christian oh I am this
[1:59:10] way because I'm a Christian you got the
[1:59:18] wrong attitude
[1:59:19] about that
[1:59:29] I am the way the truth the life no man
[1:59:41] cometh unto the father but by me if you
[1:59:47] would have known him you should know my
[1:59:50] father also and henceforth you know him
[1:59:55] and you've seen him brother on I want to
[1:59:59] see Jesus
[2:00:01] he's living he's a living he's living in
[2:00:08] Johnson City he's living in Louisiana
[2:00:13] I'd like to report he's living in Elkton
[2:00:16] Virginia
[2:00:28] I love you I love you with all my heart
[2:00:43] hallelujah you'll get to cut the curls
[2:00:48] again they're growing really really slow
[2:00:52] right now when I walked in and sit down
[2:00:58] in her chair many years ago I didn't
[2:01:02] preach to her I didn't tell her what a
[2:01:11] bad girl she was I didn't tell her I
[2:01:17] lost but I prayed in her chair you know
[2:01:23] I did that
[2:01:33] you're just here your children said that
[2:01:42] Jesus has changed your life got time for
[2:01:52] one more story I was being pushed into
[2:01:59] the operating room and they prayed a
[2:02:05] prayer I pray for you as a church I pray
[2:02:12] for my family I prayed that God would
[2:02:17] break the cycle of this cancer and the
[2:02:31] man that was pushing the the hospital
[2:02:35] bed they called him transport he said
[2:02:43] that's the most beautiful prayer I've
[2:02:46] ever heard prayed I hope he saw Jesus on
[2:03:00] the way to the operating room I love you
[2:03:06] with all my heart I want to thank you
[2:03:12] for your time today

[2:07:23] did you see a man that had been
[2:07:25] diagnosed with cancer did you see Jesus
[2:07:29] did you see the formalities or did you
[2:07:32] see Jesus and what will you do with this
[2:07:37] man called Jesus the word has been
[2:07:43] delivered to you you will make your ways
[2:07:46] home go about your week but what will
[2:07:50] you do with Jesus sister what will you
[2:07:54] allow Jesus to do you let them enter
[2:07:59] your your home enter your heart into
[2:08:04] your relationships what will you do with
[2:08:07] this man called Jesus I know what hard
[2:08:11] to do I want to make him Lord
[2:08:15] not just Lord over services the Lord
[2:08:19] over my heart Lord over everything
[2:08:24] that I no longer own anything but he
[2:08:27] owns it all
[2:08:28] he's the one that gave us life why don't
[2:08:33] we let Jesus take our life the Jesus our
[2:08:39] matters is more than
[2:08:45] what we would say is a watered-down
[2:08:46] Jesus or other Jesus the Jesus on that
[2:08:52] is a healer
[2:08:55] the Jesus I met as a way maker the Jesus
[2:08:59] I met
[2:09:01] the first day I met him he was a promise
[2:09:04] keeper and every day since he's a
[2:09:08] promise keeper he's a provider
[2:09:12] he's a deliverer he's an aunt I'm God
[2:09:16] he's awesome he's mighty he's powerful
[2:09:20] that's the Jesus I know I don't know
[2:09:24] where Jesus that gives up but I know
[2:09:28] it's Jesus they keeps pushing on and I
[2:09:33] know that this Jesus will do the work
[2:09:36] that we've asked him to do to me sure
[2:09:41] the world may look and they may see a
[2:09:43] different Ron Spencer
[2:09:45] and maybe what they seen a few months
[2:09:47] ago but I've seen a preacher today
[2:09:52] a gospel preacher that squared down and
[2:09:56] rolled his shoulders back and preached
[2:09:59] to you that one of the deepest sermons
[2:10:03] you ever hear whether Ron kept saying
[2:10:06] it's simple but there will be people
[2:10:08] that walk out of the service as sure as
[2:10:10] I'm standing here that we'll miss what
[2:10:13] were their own priests today who is
[2:10:16] Jesus who is Jesus dude there's one
[2:10:20] statement that brother branham makes
[2:10:22] that to me it's probably one of my most
[2:10:24] favorite statements he said what makes
[2:10:27] him God to me is that he came from the
[2:10:31] highest
[2:10:32] and he went to the lowest but he came to
[2:10:36] me oh what a wonderful day it is to
[2:10:40] serve our Lord Jesus ain't God good
[2:10:45] is he God to you a man is good is he God
[2:10:51] to you today do you love him today will
[2:10:56] you make him your Lord of all maybe we
[2:10:59] we sing that song you deserve the glory
[2:11:02] you deserve the honor

[2:11:08] dismiss you from the back roads to the
[2:11:11] to the front and the bridge deacons and
[2:11:13] the ushers will dismiss you so thank you
[2:11:15] for being than this service today I
[2:11:19] trust we don't have to have too many
