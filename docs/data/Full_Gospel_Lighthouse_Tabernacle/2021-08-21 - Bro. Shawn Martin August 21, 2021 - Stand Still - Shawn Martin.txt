turn to the second chronicles the 20th chapter and like to say it's good to have my son and daughter-in-law here with us and brother sam jones our deacon and brother josiah mclaren another deacon of

and our heads to you lord we we know that we need in you for you're the one that has started the race you're the one that's going to complete it i believe you've called us here you've ordained this night you've ordained each individual to be here that's here and lord it's not for just for entertainment lord but it's you want to speak and you're wanting to work and father i pray that you had helped me just to humble myself and just get myself out of the way and lord that you would work the gift lord that you placed in me before the foundation of the world and lord that the people there be something that you placed within them that could respond and father every spirit that would try to hinder this service i pray you would drive it away lord may you have preeminence in jesus christ's name we pray and the church says amen and amen uh second chronicles the 20th chapter and i i want to start at the the first verse and read a few verses here uh but it says it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of amen and with them other besides the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side of syria and behold they be in that city there praise the lord i'm glad i live in reiner i've got to go to college to learn that one so uh and which is in in gedi and um and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaim the fast throughout all judah and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court and he said uh unto uh and he said o lord god of our fathers are not thou god in heaven and rule us not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee i want to stop there and i'd like to go down to the the 14th verse it says then upon jehaziah if that's the right word uh the son of zechariah the son of anaya the son of jael the son of matania a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jerusalem you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the lord will be with you amen you can have your seats this evening i i just have a a simple thought and uh trust it'll uh help you tonight but the the just the thought of stan steele and i i think we could um kind of compare our conditions uh with the conditions that we just read we we see that israel is in a great crisis there's an invading army that is coming against them and you could just imagine this army it's um uh pretty they're they're bold they're they're coming at israel with great confidence that they're going to win the war uh they're determined to destroy god's people uh they they're they're well equipped they're outnumbering israel by by far and uh so really the odds are on their side um uh they they you know it's it's um uh so they're they're coming with great confidence and so you you could imagine israel in the situation that they understand as well that uh they're getting ready to get slaughtered they understand that the enemy is too great to even try to go out and fight them and and so it was a strenuous time for israel it was a time of of of you know frustration then and you know they were all just flustered and agitated and and con confused if you could say it that way and they didn't know which way to go they didn't know what to do they it it was a a great time just all tore up because of this army invading them and and the prophet the prophet tells us many times and notice how he said many times we all get to that place to where we can't stand still and we're nervous just as we start to do something good we see trouble coming can you say man now i know i see a lot of young people so i'm just going to take my time like i told you i'm not a great preacher like your pastor but so uh he's a wonderful minister and and but but he felt led to have us so i'm just going to just take my obey the lord and and be myself but i see a lot of you young people and and you know i i want to i want you to really ponder what the prophet is saying here is that when when we start to do something good evil is always present the moment you you try to move for god don't expect it to be an easy road don't don't expect it to be a life of these because it's not going to be a life of these it's it's because you're coming again you're coming to your victory you're coming to what god has has called you to be and satan's going to do everything possible to keep you from coming to what god has called you to be can you say amen so so we see this and i guarantee you that if you had your elders to stand up they could all testify that as when i start to pray the devil's go the devil's been there when i start to fast the devil's there when i when i start to find what god has called me to do devil's there to i meet resistance constantly when i set out to seek the holy oak there's a constant resistance can you say amen you're not always going to feel saved you're not always going to feel called you're not always going to feel like praying and the moment you start to pray and the moment you start to break through just know that the devil is right there to resist you [Applause] can you say amen god's people fat we are warriors can you say man amen that's right amen the moment you try to come into church and you get your mind on god just remember the devil's going to meet you right in your pew now we find amen now the prophet says as soon as we start to do something good we see trouble coming but that is the devil everybody say it's the devil trying to to upset the program of god and we find it in our individual lives and you're gonna find it in your own life you find it in the church world you find it in our national affairs you find it everywhere and then we know that when we are getting ready to do right wrong is always present ain't that right and a lot of times wrong isn't some evil picture a lot of the time it's enticing can you say amen but it's the enemy so we find a wrong is always present but the way to overcome that is to think in your heart which way god would have you to go and which is the best way and then stay with that way can you say man now thank god that there was a man named jehoshaphat a man that that in the midst of trouble in the midst of of of chaos and confusion and and and when trouble was everywhere and and defeat was looming over them he knew what it was to pray amen he didn't turn to anybody else he didn't find the blame in everybody else he got on his knees and he began to call out to god i think that's what we need today is a people that know how to pray can you say amen we need parents that know how to pray we need young people that know how to pray can you say amen amen psychologists ain't got the answer ain't that right amen but god has the answer and jehoshaphat began to pray unto the lord amen and and i i believe that prayer is so vital to our christian walk amen but i say to you prayer amen requires a submitted heart prayer requires a heart full of trust can you say amen it's a sign of submission to the lord it's a sign of recognition amen that god you know all things and i'm here trusting in your divine wisdom ain't that right oftentimes our prayer is filled with complaint god why are you doing this god why are you allowing this god i just don't understand god when are you going to do this and when are you going to help out here and i don't understand why you're allowing this and a lot of times it's full of complain amen when our prayer shouldn't be full of complain can you say man i understand humanly amen the satan puts them question marks and all of that but i look at jehoshaphat look at the prayer that he prayed it was a prayer of god you are god god you are mighty god you reign upon high can you say man amen he prayed unto god ain't that right let's look at the prayer ii chronicles 20 and 6 oh lord god our of our fathers are not thou got in heaven he remembered that he was god in heaven amen and rulest thou over uh uh over all the kingdoms of the heathen in other words he's acknowledging that the heathen ain't coming to destroy him without god's allowing it you understand what i'm saying he recognized that the trouble that's coming god was in control god ain't amen the enemy ain't got anything over god you're troubling got anything over god who is a who is the sin what sin can put god in checkmate what sickness can put god in checkmate what trial that you go through can put god in checkmate whether you're up in the mountain or whether you're down in the valley he's still god do you believe it he's still god whether you're going in your darkest trial of your life he's still god nothing changes with god your trial may change your situation can change but nothing changes with god notice you not rule rule is thou not over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee hallelujah how do you see god tonight do you see god on the throne do you see god is victorious can you say amen the enemy was right there you're going to destroy them but jehoshaphat looked at the almighty god you're still able to control these things you're still able to do whatever you will [Applause] now notice he says so that none will able is able to withstand thee are not thou our god who did us drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gave us it to the seed of abraham thy friend forever and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying if when evie evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment pestilence or famine we stand before this house in my presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in everybody say in our affliction then thou will hear and help he's not just a god when you're feeling good he's a god that will hear you in your affliction hello [Applause] i like how he puts that you'll hear us in our affliction why why would he put that gotta allow that because it's usually an affliction that we don't feel god it's usually in our affliction amen that it seems like god is far away it's usually in our afflictions amen when satan amen takes advantage and starts whispering in our ear god's forsaken you god ain't going to heal you your prayer ain't getting through amen and he'll whisper them things that god says i will hear and help in your affliction now notice jehoshaphat is not talking to god as a stranger he's not talking to god as maybe an egyptian or as a babylonian wood or whatever he's talking to god as a seed of abraham and he's reminding god i'm part of this promise every promise you made i'm part of are you with me now every promise you made i'm a part of that abraham seed i am part of that covenant you drove out the uh uh the enemy away from israel amen and then you brought him out of that land of slavery now i am here as part of that seed if you've done it for them you'll do it for me it was a personal god to him he's talking to god knowing that he is part of the promise that god gave i think that's important to approach god not as a stranger not wandering not with question marks on top of her head but coming to god with an assurance every promise you made i'm part of can you say amen i may not feel like it i i i may not amen feeling you everywhere but i know this one thing i'm part of the covenant [Applause] and i'm here to remind you god of who i am you hear your pastor you hear brother andrew and the ministers tell you who you are but now it's time sometimes you got to tell god who you are it's got to come from your own lips i am a son of god you say well that's a little arrogant no it isn't you're telling the devil i'm a child of god i'm a daughter of god i'm a son of god god loves to hear confidence coming out of his people it's an act of faith can you say amen paul even said the word of faith which we preach is even nicely even in thy mouth [Applause] ain't that right so so jehoshaphat had faith not in just that god was able not that just god could do it but he had faith in who he was and as he's reminding god of what he done to israel he's literally minding god of who he is as a seed of israel you see for the enemy to destroy israel and jehoshaphat would be for god to fail are you with me because it wasn't jehoshaphat wasn't pointing it now there there your seed over here but god look at me i hope i am he was putting it personally can you say amen see so so jehoshaphat is reminding god why they're a nation in the first place god we would have been in egypt but you brought us out god we're a mighty people but it's because of you you've sustained us all the way through generation after generation amen now you can just read between the lines of really what he's saying to god because look if god would keep his word throughout the ages then that enemy didn't matter to them because god would still keep it [Applause] young people god's kept your your elders why can't god keep you [Applause] it's not about natural lineage it's about predestination it's about a seed of god living inside of you can you say amen and if god if god fought my daddy's battles and my mama's battles god will fight my battles and if god will fight my battles he'll fight my children's battles he'll fight your battles he's a god that keeps his word he's a god that'll keep his word you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be anything mighty you just have to be a seed of abraham just a seed and right in the middle of all the frustration god spoke to a prophet standing near that's what the prophet said he was a prophet the word of the lord comes to prophets right and the lord began to speak to them you'll not need to fight this battle set yourselves stand still and see the salvation of the lord in other words stand still keep calm keep your spirit calm can you say man don't allow yourself get frustrated don't allow yourself get tore up you say well you don't understand oh yes i do understand that god keeps his word [Applause] god did nothing to the enemy at that point the enemy's still approaching the enemy's looming on them and yet god says stand still stand still he used a prophet to tell them and israel always believed their prophet amen for a prophet in the midst of them knew it was a sign to them that god would speak and when that man spoke they knew god's one is speaking stand still and see the salvation of the lord can you say amen see the prophet said god was going to show his glory to them but he had to give them to stand still first watch the order of god stand still and see the salvation of the lord can you say amen see they were panicking because they were afraid they were tore up because they didn't have answers have you ever just been in a place you don't have answers and you're seeking for answers and troubles everywhere and you've got to find the answer you're going to die they were there and god said stand still i don't care what you got to do just stand still if you got to turn your back to the enemy just stand still if you if you can't stand still while the enemy's approaching look somewhere else but just stand still god had to get them to stand still in order to show them his power [Applause] the spirit of fear and anxiety was taken advantage and was getting on the people parents didn't know what to tell their children preachers didn't know what to tell their children the church everybody was at a at a place of confusion what are we going to do but then the voice came stand still see god couldn't show them his glory and power to them as long as they were in that state of mind now the prophet of god likens that age to this age we're in a neurotic age people running to and fro trying to find answers they're jumping to this job this job this job this church this church this church they're jumping from this politician to this politician to that politic they're trying to find the answers can you say amen i'll tell you why the lid of hell has been lifted demon power is here like never before the prophet even preached invasion of the united states we're here in this invasion people are leaving the message like crazy turning their backs upon it and see satan's demonic power is invading homes churches schools government the whole world is being invaded can you say man people are bothered by the least very little thing that comes their way that's right and they're seeking answers to solve the problem they're in a panic there's so much chaos and such unrest that notice in the middle of the chaos god would send a prophet with strict instructions stand still [Music] while the churches have no answer this pride does why politics have no answers this brad does and it's the easiest answer stand still parents stand still children stand still pastor stan steele [Applause] stand still why the prophet said it's god's battle it's not ours to begin with notice what it says god wants us everybody say god wants us to stand still turn around tell somebody god wants you to stand still stand still the world's in a panic but not you god doesn't want us to be tore up [Music] we're the bride of jesus christ can you say amen church i said we're the bride of jesus christ we're in a rapture and age and this battle don't belong to us it's god's battle stand still quit letting the devil convince you that it's not going to work out quit letting the devil lie to you and tell you you're going to miss the rapture quit letting the devil tell you that your sins aren't forgiven quit letting the devil tell you that you're a failure stand still [Applause] any voice that's putting fear in your mind is of the devil can you say amen in any spirit that is putting you in anxiety a nervous condition is of the devil that's how you know the enemy stand still second timothy 1 7 breaking in god hath not given us the spirit of fear so where spirits where's fear coming from the devil the devil can you say amen that's what's trying to invade this this people today is the spirit of fear the spirit of anxiety the spirit of restlessness [Applause] stand still [Applause] god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind you're not going to lose your mind still and see the glory of god you're not going to have a nervous condition stand still and see the glory of god [Applause] you love him i can't help but believe that god knew that where they were i believe he knew the kind of situation they were in i somehow believe that god allowed the situation to come you believe that god allows it everybody say god allows it god allows it he allows the situation to get really bad you mean god of love yes a god of love you mean he puts me out there so so it looks like i'm the one that's going to be destroyed yes now don't get quiet on me now but he does it to show his glory [Applause] can you say man he ain't putting some dummy out there he's putting his own child out there but it's a child of promise i will never leave you nor forsake you i will be with you even till the end of the age can you say amen there's no weapon formed against you that will prosper it's a child a promise stand still hallelujah when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall raise up a standard it's a child of promise victory is already yours deliverance is already yours healing is already yours he's already given you the promise before he put you in the battle he gave you promise glory to god he put you there to show that he's the one mighty in battle it's not your battle it's not up to you it's not up to you it's up to him right you see the this invading army is not really coming against you it's actually coming against the lord himself [Applause] it's the lord's battle if the lord has called us then it's up to him to take care of us you believe that if he's called this assembly do you know it's up to him to take care of it now just go back to memory lane and see what god has done for you what god has done for this church you ain't going under [Music] this ministry ain't going under this bride ain't going under he started he will be faithful god ordained it god ordained it it's his battle i don't need a fear i need to rest in the promise you say oh but sean it's getting bad oh good well i can't help you on that when all i can say is stand still [Music] and that ain't me that's him that's god himself telling you stand still i know it it would be nice if he'd give you the formula and tell you what day it's going to end and that you ain't going to have to go through these battles but all he says is stand still i don't care what matter you're going through the same the same answer we all have that same answer stand still stand still stand still he made the promise that he'd never forget us isaiah 49 15 can a woman forget her suckling child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay they may forget now you think of that because we hear brother brown talking about that baby that was in that burning home and that mother took off running after she was a beautiful woman but she didn't care about her beauty at that time she worried about that baby she couldn't forget about that baby she couldn't let the the the hot gluten wasn't hot and the fire wasn't hot enough to allow her to forget about that baby she would be willing to go through them flames and be scarred the rest of her life for that little baby and if god if a natural woman would be that way what about god concerning you for he said they may forget yet i will not i will not forget thee behold i have the graven upon the palms of my hands and thy walls are continually everybody say continually continually before me now you think of that not that you have him continually before you you are continually before him so everywhere he looks you're right there he can look this way you're there he can look that way you're there he can look this way you're there when he looks down you're there when he looks up you're there you're continually before him there ain't no smoke in your trial can block you out you're continually before him there ain't no scars of your past can disfigure you before him he's knows what he called you and that's what he sees constantly before him he ain't looking at your imperfection he's not looking at your weakness he's not looking at your inability what he called you to be is what's continually before him before him and when we forgive he will never forget because you're continually before him stand still how do we stand still by standing on the promise stand still keep the promise before you you with me stand still see your enemy is god's enemy don't you think that he's left your enemy and you to fight him all alone no no no no no no he's fighting with you stand still can you say amen sometimes it seems as if god might have joined up with our enemy it seemed like everything's going wrong and we're not finding the answers but don't you let the devil lie to you [Applause] the devil is the only one that's accuser of the brethren do you believe that the devil is the accuser of the brethren not god if god wanted to accuse you he would have done that before the foundation of the world but instead of accusing you he had a landslide before the foundation of the world that he could look at the blood and not you [Music] now that's what the prophet says he says he don't see me he sees the blood but he hears my voice [Applause] ain't that right now notice jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts that i think towards you said the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end now jehoshaphat in in in looking at these things i believe that he remembered it was god that brought his people out of egypt it was him that he remembered it was god that delivered them from slavery he remembered that god brought the water from a rock when they were about to die of thirst can you say man he remembered how that god anointed that little stone that's david looking at that glass and by all rights he should die but he was a child of promise and as that slaughter that sling released that stone the spirit of the lord rode on that stone and it become a super dynamic stone that it even broke the sound barrier stand still throughout the bible god would speak through the prophets to let the peoples know that his heart and attitude has never changed toward them and i hope this is all right to read but isaiah 43 1 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine aren't you glad he possessed you he's got you as his possession you are his thou art mine when thou passes through the waters i will be with thee he didn't say you're going to feel me he said i will be with you can you say amen that's right see and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee and when thou walketh through the fire thou shall not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy savior i gave the egypt for thy ransom and ethiopia and siba for thee since thou was precious in my sight thou has been honorable i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life fear not for i am with thee years later god would speak to the prophet malachi and say for i am the lord i change not therefore you sons of jacob are not consumed pretty bold and that's very just pretty blunt you're not consumed because i am the lord and i change not [Applause] if god was with you in the first day of your of your christian life he's still with you if god saved you and he found it pleasing to fill you with the holy ghost don't you ever think that he's left you he's walking right with you he's with you in the valley when you ain't feeling him he's with you and the blood is speaking for you psalms 145 19 he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him you see why you need to stand still he will fulfill the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them the lord preserveth all them that love him that all the wicked will he destroy see he cannot change do you love him in he wonderful so the question is are you his righteous seed who made you his righteous seed god did didn't that basic god did it wasn't my desire to be it give us god's desire you you might be desire oh i want to serve god i want to serve god i want to serve god and your desire is right but think of the desire that he has that is magnified thousands of times than your desire he desires to have a walk with you he so desired to fill you with the holy ghost that he made a way so he could do it and you say amen i believe he so desired for you to go on the rapture that he would send a prophet to get you ready [Applause] it's grace do you realize it's grace it's the desire on god's part we weren't crying for a prophet we weren't saying god sent us a prophet but way before this age he wrote it in the bible behold i sent unto you elijah the prophet it was from his desire [Music] his desire can you say amen [Music] now the prophet said see it was god's battle as long as they were together and praying don't make it your battle you with me you say oh but that was them no no no no the prophet said this is like an our day there's the enemy that's invading and there's a people that's the seed of god now not everybody has these same words that you're hearing not everybody knows what to do but god has told you stand still and he's giving you every reason why to stand still you're a child of promise you're predestinated you've got a destiny [Applause] you believe that i don't take long so i hope i'm not keeping you too long i promised i wasn't a two-hour preacher today so i'll try to hurry but you realize and i know you do that not every scripture in this bible pertains to us and a lot of times ministers especially when they get into a legalist idea my frame of mind they'll take scriptures to use it to be the bride up when it don't belong to bride can you say amen don't be worried i'm not off but i can tell you this the prophet said a christian will never blaspheme god so when it speaks of blasphemy that ain't to a bride so don't let the devil put that on you say well i've just i've crossed the line a believer can never cross the line [Applause] you say oh you're putting it out there where everybody can do what they what they can do no i'm just telling you stand still and see the salvation of the lord don't let the devil tear you up with scriptures that don't belong to you [Applause] there are scriptures that pertain to the ungodly they're scriptures that pertain to the foolish virgin [Applause] can you say amen there are scriptures that pertain to people that's going to be at the white throne judgment but i'll never stand at the white throne judgment i'm a bride of christ you say well how do you know because i know in my heart so therefore when i pray to god i don't pray to god as a foolish virgin i pray to god as a son of god [Applause] can you say amen therefore i can remind god of the promises that belong to me [Applause] you with me how can i stand still if i'm afraid i'm going to go in the tribulation that's why the people the world's nervous the wrath of god is coming up on this earth they don't know what to do about it they're trying to laugh their way out of it they're trying to move either way out of it they're trying to entertain their way out of it and they're restless they're trying to find every which way to avoid the wrath of god that's coming but when i go to god i know that scripture doesn't pertain i i hope you know where you're at [Applause] because i believe this bride is going to know who she is and when she knows who she is she'll be an invincible army [Music] could you imagine the son of god going to god in prayer not knowing who he is we've had that through years but that's why god would send the message that we could identify ourselves in the book brother brown said you can find your character in the bible remember ron i've i've searched my character i don't fit ahab can you say amen i see there's a bright character i believe paul knew who he was i believe the prophet knew who he was did not the angel tell show brother branham who he was brother branham knew he come to the understanding he was malachi 4. did he not he come to the understanding that he was that seventh angel if god could show him why can't god show us that we're the bride of christ how many is the bride of christ not because your pastor told yet not because i tell you not because even the prophet tells you it's because god has showed you by divine revelation [Applause] then the book becomes an open book it becomes a new book it becomes a personal book can you say amen john knew who he was the bible said i mean the prophet said when the book was opened john saw his name and i don't believe that john just saw his name on one page i believe every promise that pertained to the bride of christ john saw his little name right there [Music] stand still and see the salvation of the lord you love him stand still now i'm going close but the prophet said god made the red sea stand still bird's children because he wanted to show his glory when jesus stood at the grave of lazarus think of it death had taken over and corruption began to set in because he had been in there four days maybe the sockets eye sockets her eyes were already decayed maybe parts of the flesh was already the skin worms had already devoured a lot but god made death stand still to show forth his power and when jesus said lazarus come forth it wasn't just what remained of lazarus that came forth death had to give everything back [Applause] i don't know if he made the skin worms burp it back up i don't know but all i know is when lazarus came forth there was a restored lazarus because death had to stand still to see god's glory he'll make arthritis stand still he'll make cancer stand still he'll make tuberculosis stand still to see his glory i say to you god is with this church god is with this bride well give him glory church hallelujah stand still and see the salvation of the lord you see what god is doing to this bride he's making the devil stand still he's making that drunk spirit stand still while the drunk is delivered can you say amen yes sir hey man now i i if you'll read jehoshaphat go and read on down that after they heard the voice of the lord stand still that jehoshaphat bowed his head and bowed to himself to the ground and all israel bowed themselves and began to worship the lord they literally forgot about the army and began to worship the lord the word of the lord was good enough for them i don't care what the doctor's report is we've got the word of the lord hallelujah hallelujah the musicians will come we've got the word of the lord stand still and see the glory of god hallelujah y'all

building and maybe come and gather around and maybe we could pray i i know that many hands have been laid on your pastor so we don't we don't feel like we're anything special but i'd i just like to pray with him he's had a rough week this week and i know you love your pastor and i think just while the spirit of the lord is here maybe we could just lay hands upon him praise the name is [Music] so [Music] jesus christ [Music] is there anyone that need prayer before we turn it over i believe god answers prayer don't you [Music] i remember just in a meeting there at brother can sam kinser's years ago we had preached and a brother came up and says brother martin i've got six months to live the doctor says i made up with cancer he said i'm scared he said would you just pray that god will give me faith to believe i said yes sir we will so we have the church to pray and as we begin to pray [Music] he told me afterward he says you know he said i was scared he said but as i was going back to my seat something just hit me and he said i got to my seat and i told my wife i'm healed in jesus name [Music] about a month later brother sam kinzer pastor he said hey he called me and says hey just wanted you know you remember brother so and so you prayed for us yesterday he said he wanted me to let you know he just got a clean bill of health he's cancer-free [Music] that's a god that we serve
