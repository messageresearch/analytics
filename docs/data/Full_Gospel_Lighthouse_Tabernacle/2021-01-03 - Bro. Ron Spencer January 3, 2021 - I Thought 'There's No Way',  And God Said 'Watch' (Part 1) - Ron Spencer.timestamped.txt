[48:31] amen i certainly love you
[48:34] amen any good to us
[48:38] amen certainly enjoyed last night i
[48:41] don't know if you got to see it
[48:43] but i i certainly i certainly was very
[48:47] very inspired by each speaker that spoke
[48:50] and they're
[48:51] in their ways and it's kind of like
[48:54] different artists
[48:55] stepping into a and step into the same
[48:58] canvas
[48:59] and putting their part there and so it
[49:01] was so so wonderful
[49:03] amen amen we're strictly
[49:06] instructed not to look back
[49:10] and i think i think any time that a
[49:12] person gets
[49:13] disillusioned is when they start looking
[49:16] back
[49:16] and maybe looking back to the things
[49:18] they came from
[49:19] or looking back to the disappointments
[49:22] of life
[49:23] we're going to all have them in our
[49:26] journey we're going to all have them
[49:27] and so amen we're going to go through
[49:30] just like what we are here
[49:33] in virginia we are a unique state
[49:35] because we experience
[49:37] all four seasons very well
[49:40] whether it's spring or whether it's
[49:42] summer or fall or winter
[49:45] in our spiritual walk it's the very same
[49:48] way
[49:49] in the winter time it'll be times to
[49:51] where you don't feel god it feels like
[49:52] he's a million miles away
[49:54] but just wait a few days spring will
[49:57] come
[49:58] resurrection will take place new revival
[50:02] in your life
[50:03] and then the summer of the fruits and
[50:05] you enjoy that in the fall you just
[50:08] i i think fall is the greatest time of
[50:10] the year to myself other
[50:13] uh other than spring but we all love
[50:15] spring the grass is
[50:17] getting green and starting to feel some
[50:19] warm days and robins are showing up and
[50:22] we love that time of year and of course
[50:25] for most of us
[50:26] hunters here we enjoy the fall and so
[50:29] boxers
[50:33] amen amen i
[50:36] i just want to i've got a little church
[50:38] business to do this morning and
[50:40] and then we'll go forward with the word
[50:42] if that's okay if you can just pay
[50:44] patient with me
[50:46] 2020 brought about a lot of difficult
[50:48] things for us this year
[50:50] and uh kovid was a was a very vicious
[50:53] thing and
[50:54] i noticed this morning that in america
[50:56] 350
[50:58] 000 people have died from covid
[51:01] in the last year it's a dreaded disease
[51:05] but god's greater than covet
[51:08] and he has proved he has proved he's
[51:11] greater than that
[51:13] and um but here at the church our church
[51:16] is strong and
[51:17] we report to you that it's strong and
[51:19] it's we're a body movement we're a team
[51:22] that works together
[51:24] and uh this morning we're going to
[51:26] ordain a deacon

[56:14] and he said i knew now why you you felt
[56:17] led to move that to brother adam's job
[56:19] but brother ma adam mows these

[56:26] brother adam for what he does and
[56:28] amen i know you're not asking for that
[56:30] he and his dad take care of the flowers
[56:33] of the church and
[56:34] all the things that goes on and so we
[56:36] just so appreciate that with all of our
[56:38] hearts
[56:42] last year was a difficult year for us
[56:44] here
[56:45] and we lost sister katie lorendo
[56:50] she was a quiet and she was powerful
[56:53] voice here
[56:54] and she was here i i would think three
[56:58] years maybe
[56:59] and when she would sit in the church she
[57:01] would just kind of rock
[57:03] and then once in a while she'd go in a
[57:05] circle
[57:07] and you knew it was on when she was
[57:08] going in a circle and so
[57:11] amen and so we miss her she's now not
[57:14] 90 years old she is a young lady in
[57:18] heaven
[57:19] and we we sure we sure loved her
[57:23] we lost sister meadows
[57:27] a matriarch of a family a powerful voice
[57:31] to this audience
[57:33] a real mate to brother brother meadows
[57:37] and we all loved her with all of her
[57:39] hearts and probably
[57:41] 70 percent of this congregation his
[57:43] grandchildren i don't know
[57:48] amen she was she was a absolutely great
[57:51] lady
[57:53] lost her son larry and
[57:56] and uh he was an absolute he was an
[57:59] absolute wonderful man
[58:00] behind the scenes for their family did a
[58:03] lot of work and attributed to a lot of
[58:05] things
[58:06] and still does sometimes our legacy
[58:09] still lives on
[58:11] sister sharon shifflet that called this
[58:12] her church for
[58:14] many many years lost her and brother
[58:17] andrew actually preached that funeral
[58:19] while i was very very sick we had a
[58:22] fellow that came here that was an odd
[58:24] sort of a fellow
[58:25] sometimes eternal life comes in odd ways
[58:29] we met this man many many years ago in
[58:31] the business world
[58:34] rough is not the words to say
[58:38] his his mantra was that he wore his
[58:41] shirt unbuttoned all the way to his
[58:43] belly button
[58:45] but for church he buttoned up at least
[58:47] one extra button and we were thankful we
[58:50] were thankful for that
[58:53] he loved us he loved you he was a
[58:56] contributor to this audience
[58:59] even behind the scenes didn't show up
[59:01] much he would say some people don't need
[59:03] as much
[59:04] church as other people needs but
[59:08] but i'll never forget his funeral it was
[59:11] the place that i saw matthew become a
[59:13] real
[59:14] preacher and it was the fir
[59:18] i saw him preach here behind the pulpit
[59:20] many times but when i saw him preach
[59:23] on on that morning i said he's made it
[59:27] i thought last night matthew did
[59:29] phenomenal as well
[59:32] [Music]
[59:41] but john hinton was a man that we all
[59:43] loved many of you loved many of you got
[59:45] to know him
[59:46] but he was a man that we loved he was
[59:48] eccentric he had his own ways he hated
[59:50] preachers
[59:51] and yet wound up with us as his best
[59:53] friends
[59:56] and we loved him and we love his family
[1:00:02] ellwood gregory that just passed away he
[1:00:04] was attached to family here
[1:00:06] we we preached his funeral and i'll
[1:00:10] never forget this funeral because
[1:00:12] god spoke to me on the day that i was
[1:00:15] preparing to preach the funeral
[1:00:17] and he gave me words and literally i
[1:00:19] heard the voice of the lord speak to me
[1:00:22] i care do you care
[1:00:26] and god does care this week we've lost
[1:00:29] brother roby turner
[1:00:31] a minister that came to our meetings
[1:00:34] many through the years
[1:00:35] 85 years old they're a body that will
[1:00:38] will have transition it will have it
[1:00:41] will have to
[1:00:42] to elect a new pastor to take the role
[1:00:45] i don't know who will do that don't even
[1:00:47] have an unction that's above my pay
[1:00:49] grade
[1:00:50] but we just pray that god would just be
[1:00:52] with the family
[1:00:53] brother joe green is to preach the
[1:00:55] funeral this week
[1:00:56] i probably will not go because of my own
[1:00:59] personal health at this point
[1:01:01] but i would like for you to remember
[1:01:03] them in prayer that god would just be
[1:01:05] with them
[1:01:07] amen amen
[1:01:11] we have a ministry team here that god
[1:01:13] has put together and we certainly are so
[1:01:15] appreciative of
[1:01:17] god brought me here starting in 1999
[1:01:21] of course i preached here in 1984
[1:01:24] and uh and every every year i would
[1:01:26] become here
[1:01:28] come here periodically through the years
[1:01:29] and then in 1999
[1:01:31] we accepted and and you voted for me to
[1:01:34] become the
[1:01:35] the pastor along with brother homer
[1:01:39] and i moved here in 2000 july of 2000
[1:01:43] since then my boys have grew up
[1:01:47] and i didn't put them in the ministry
[1:01:48] because if i could have i'd have
[1:01:50] stopped them but i'm very thrilled to
[1:01:53] say that brother matthew has
[1:01:55] has done as well as he's doing and
[1:01:57] growing
[1:01:58] and we are so thankful brother matthew
[1:02:00] for all that you do
[1:02:02] music leading the services and getting
[1:02:05] everything
[1:02:05] in order we thank you for that amen
[1:02:08] brother andrew that became our interim
[1:02:10] acting
[1:02:11] right hand whatever sovereign right land

[1:02:23] you know and we thank you for that
[1:02:33] i i thought it was absolutely sovereign
[1:02:35] in the way that god did it
[1:02:37] and it was our last communion service in
[1:02:40] february
[1:02:41] and i'm sorry it's been that long but
[1:02:43] due to due to covid we
[1:02:45] we're just where we are but we
[1:02:48] elected brother andrew and you voted as
[1:02:51] an audience as a full body
[1:02:53] that brother andrew would would would do
[1:02:56] the job
[1:02:57] many churches wait till after the
[1:02:59] pastor's deceased
[1:03:01] and then it goes through all kind of
[1:03:02] voting and all kind of trials and all
[1:03:04] kind of that
[1:03:05] god has provided for us that we don't
[1:03:07] have to do that
[1:03:09] and so should i pass tomorrow it will be
[1:03:12] no hiccups next saturday night
[1:03:14] so so and i'm not passing tomorrow let
[1:03:17] me say it like that
[1:03:19] i got i got a lot of work to do a lot of
[1:03:21] sermons preach a lot of conventions to

[1:03:38] is and not just my desire but the will
[1:03:40] of the people is

[1:03:55] you don't mind me taking a few moments
[1:03:57] here
[1:03:59] our deacons just as a reminder of you
[1:04:01] our deacons
[1:04:02] we lost brother john kelly last year and
[1:04:05] the reason i didn't mention him just a
[1:04:07] little while ago because i wanted to
[1:04:08] bring him into
[1:04:09] the the the group of deacons that we
[1:04:13] have
[1:04:13] brother john kelly was a very loyal
[1:04:15] faithful deacon
[1:04:17] i don't think we'll ever have another
[1:04:19] man that made as many phone calls to
[1:04:21] check on you
[1:04:22] how are you doing i'm praying for you
[1:04:25] brother john the cell phone was invented
[1:04:28] for brother john kelly
[1:04:30] and uh we just are so thankful for the
[1:04:32] work that he did
[1:04:34] also brother ralph brother ralph was an
[1:04:37] incredible
[1:04:38] worker here as a deacon and he did that
[1:04:40] for many many years
[1:04:42] we've lost several different deacons
[1:04:44] brother brother wayne gooden was an
[1:04:46] incredible deacon brother leo was an
[1:04:48] incredible deacon
[1:04:49] brother john kelly brother ralph
[1:04:52] all of these and each man operated in a
[1:04:55] different way and did different things
[1:04:57] and
[1:04:57] took on different roles and so we miss
[1:05:00] them but we're
[1:05:01] just because god takes us home don't
[1:05:03] mean the work is over with and so
[1:05:05] that's what we got to be reminded of
[1:05:08] just to remind you of who our deacons
[1:05:10] are brother vernon frazier
[1:05:12] that was here last night brother bill
[1:05:14] henkel that sits here with sister linda
[1:05:16] brother joe shifflet and brother meadows
[1:05:20] and we just thank god for each one of
[1:05:22] these men their lives and their ministry
[1:05:25] and what they have meant to this church
[1:05:28] let's give them a great big hand
[1:05:41] brother alden is what we would call a a
[1:05:43] fresher junior deacon but he's chasing
[1:05:45] me and age a little bit now and
[1:05:48] and uh how old are you brother alden
[1:05:51] 51. well brother branham called himself
[1:05:54] an old man right there

[1:06:00] deacon as well and
[1:06:02] amen we we i just began to feel led
[1:06:06] just a few months ago and i i probably
[1:06:09] have got
[1:06:10] 30 40 men in this audience that is
[1:06:13] qualified
[1:06:14] and could do the job but you know you've
[1:06:16] got to be led of god
[1:06:18] and so god led me and we have asked
[1:06:22] brother denny vance
[1:06:24] to be a deacon in this audience and be a
[1:06:27] blessing to this congregation
[1:06:40] the scripture says in first timothy
[1:06:42] chapter eight likewise must deacons
[1:06:45] be grave not double tongue not given to
[1:06:47] much wine
[1:06:49] not greedy a filthy lucr this is
[1:06:52] important
[1:06:53] holding the mystery of faith in a pure
[1:06:55] conscience
[1:06:57] and let these also first be proved
[1:07:00] then let them use the office of a deacon
[1:07:02] being found blameless
[1:07:04] even so their wives must be grave not
[1:07:06] slanderers sober
[1:07:08] faithful in all things let the deacons
[1:07:10] be the husband of one wife ruling their
[1:07:13] children
[1:07:14] and and their own houses well
[1:07:17] for they have used the office of a
[1:07:19] deacon well purchased to themselves

[1:24:07] you just for just a few minutes on
[1:24:10] i thought
[1:24:13] there's no way
[1:24:17] and then god said watch
[1:24:25] i thought there's just no way
[1:24:30] and then god said watch
[1:24:38] in saint john chapter 14 and verse 20
[1:24:42] at that day you shall know that
[1:24:46] i am in my father
[1:24:50] and ye and me and i
[1:24:53] in you at that day
[1:24:57] ye shall know that i am in my father
[1:25:01] and ye in me and i

[1:25:10] 22

[1:25:17] is become the head of the corner
[1:25:22] this is the lord's doing and it is
[1:25:25] marvelous in our eyes this
[1:25:28] is the day if this is going to be the
[1:25:32] first sunday of this new year
[1:25:35] let's walk into it confident
[1:25:40] knowing who we are we're the most
[1:25:44] powerful people on the earth
[1:25:47] so let's act like it
[1:25:51] if we were born to be a champion we're
[1:25:54] champions
[1:25:56] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[1:25:59] in our
[1:26:00] eyes this is the day that the lord hath
[1:26:04] made we will rejoice
[1:26:08] and be glad in it
[1:26:15] we're pre-planned since
[1:26:18] before the foundation of the world god
[1:26:21] knew we'd be here today
[1:26:24] god is not in a in a crisis meeting
[1:26:27] i don't know how i'm going to get him
[1:26:29] out of there
[1:26:31] he's not timid he's not scared
[1:26:34] he pre-planned you the seed that he
[1:26:38] deposited
[1:26:39] in you before the foundation of the
[1:26:42] world
[1:26:43] is eternal it doesn't have anything to
[1:26:47] do with a calendar
[1:26:50] it doesn't have anything to do with time
[1:26:53] it is eternal as god is eternal
[1:26:57] it is as infinite as god is infinite
[1:27:01] god's not a myth or some theology
[1:27:05] he's god
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:08] hallelujah he's god and he is in control
[1:27:14] and if god is god and he is in control
[1:27:17] that god that's on the inside of you
[1:27:20] is bigger than your problems it's bigger
[1:27:23] than your situations
[1:27:25] it's bigger than that enemy that
[1:27:27] torments you
[1:27:28] because he's still god
[1:27:32] and there is no other
[1:27:38] look around the room there's no other
[1:27:40] god like him
[1:27:43] satan you were built by our god to be
[1:27:46] the
[1:27:46] darkness to as an antitype to the lot
[1:27:50] god built you he built you and he
[1:27:52] created you on a certain day
[1:27:54] so there's a certain day you came into
[1:27:56] existence and there's a certain day that
[1:27:58] you'll leave
[1:27:59] existence you've got an
[1:28:03] end and it's coming
[1:28:04] [Applause]
[1:28:11] now i want you to understand that we're
[1:28:13] built to overcome this
[1:28:15] age not survive it
[1:28:18] but we're built to overcome it
[1:28:20] overcoming means that you'll meet
[1:28:22] challenges in your life but you have
[1:28:25] been placed here
[1:28:27] by god you are not an accident in a womb
[1:28:37] you're not an accident in the womb
[1:28:40] you're not somebody's afterthought
[1:28:44] are you with me god watched over you
[1:28:48] and if you watched over you since adam
[1:28:50] with your natural seed
[1:28:52] he'll watch over you now
[1:28:55] if he could watch over you and you could
[1:28:58] and with
[1:28:58] when he could watch over you when you
[1:29:00] didn't have a choice
[1:29:02] you didn't have a choice to be born
[1:29:05] put me back i want to go back you didn't
[1:29:08] have that choice
[1:29:10] you didn't have a choice about your hair
[1:29:12] color you didn't have a choice about
[1:29:14] your gender
[1:29:15] [Music]
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:19] you didn't have a choice about how tall
[1:29:21] or how wide that you
[1:29:23] are or even your personality this one
[1:29:26] married this one this one married this
[1:29:28] one and this one married this one
[1:29:29] all the way down to get you here
[1:29:32] none of them might not have been
[1:29:34] believers but god's rich in mercy
[1:29:36] grabbed a hold of your life jonathan
[1:29:39] picked you up
[1:29:40] out of a deep marry clay and said here's
[1:29:42] a servant of god that i can use
[1:29:52] will overcome us that means that there
[1:29:55] will be
[1:29:56] books of written epistles read about us
[1:29:59] we think about shadrach meshach and
[1:30:01] abednego
[1:30:02] we think about samson we think about all
[1:30:05] the great men of the
[1:30:06] old testament god deposited seed
[1:30:09] as it was going on to show
[1:30:12] israel and the nations that god
[1:30:15] still lived and they overcome some
[1:30:19] phenomenal challenges
[1:30:21] whether it was the red sea opening up or
[1:30:23] tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:30:25] or a prophet standing there and remaking
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:29] altar and destroying baal's altar and
[1:30:32] rebuilding the order and calling fire
[1:30:35] from down out of heaven
[1:30:38] each one of them certain portions were
[1:30:40] written whether it would be shamgar
[1:30:43] that would grab a six foot long stick
[1:30:46] and kill
[1:30:46] 600 men they were
[1:30:50] anointed to step in the fire
[1:30:54] they were anointed to walk into lion's
[1:30:57] den
[1:30:58] they were anointed to stand to be the
[1:31:00] challenge of the age
[1:31:02] they themselves would have run with from
[1:31:05] the opposition
[1:31:07] but god inspired them and anointed them
[1:31:10] in the moment
[1:31:18] you did not call yourself to be the
[1:31:20] final voice to the final age
[1:31:23] when we see the end of a gentile
[1:31:25] dispensation
[1:31:26] winding up we see the world
[1:31:29] falling apart
[1:31:36] we would have probably chose other ages
[1:31:38] but here we are in this age
[1:31:42] and we meet challenges challenges of
[1:31:45] laodicea
[1:31:46] lukewarm uh lukewarm church age to word
[1:31:49] that even
[1:31:50] god was not welcome in it
[1:31:53] where that they took took church out of
[1:31:56] prayer out of schools and the ten
[1:31:57] commandments out of schools
[1:32:00] and this week appointed the first
[1:32:04] woman chaplain
[1:32:08] to our government
[1:32:12] this week this coming week
[1:32:17] the fulfillment of brother branham's
[1:32:18] vision
[1:32:20] will happen a catholic president
[1:32:25] active and a woman
[1:32:29] vice president
[1:32:33] brethren saw that he didn't predict it
[1:32:37] he saw that these would be the
[1:32:41] conditions of these age
[1:32:43] we know where we stand
[1:32:47] you can argue elections all you want to
[1:32:50] but god causes men to rise up to fulfill
[1:32:53] his
[1:32:54] work like to not like
[1:32:57] donald trump put israel's
[1:33:01] he put her capital back in the right
[1:33:03] spot
[1:33:05] decades passed with men making promises
[1:33:08] and would not fulfill them
[1:33:10] god raised up a man
[1:33:13] i don't know where he'll stand in the
[1:33:14] great eternities but god raised up a man
[1:33:17] to put it back because it had to be
[1:33:19] according to this word
[1:33:24] that's why i chose to vote for him again
[1:33:28] like it don't like it get mad don't get
[1:33:30] mad
[1:33:31] who cares
[1:33:43] here we are with coven kovitz started
[1:33:46] out somewhere
[1:33:48] they think maybe china started out all
[1:33:51] kind of nonsense came from it
[1:33:54] covets not bigger than god
[1:33:57] it's not bigger than god they begin to
[1:34:00] make its way across
[1:34:02] europe and across to america they made
[1:34:05] statements that won't come here
[1:34:07] well let me just say sickness don't have
[1:34:09] boundaries
[1:34:11] and so it made its way and it began to
[1:34:13] anchor now there's another wave and
[1:34:15] another wave coming
[1:34:18] they say the next wave is more
[1:34:19] contagious than this one don't get
[1:34:21] yourself scared you put yourself under
[1:34:23] the blood of jesus christ
[1:34:27] senators are dying men or
[1:34:28] representatives are dying
[1:34:30] great leaders are dying you see it's no
[1:34:33] respecter of persons
[1:34:37] god said he'd watch over us brother ron
[1:34:39] you've lost four people from your
[1:34:41] audience let me just say this to you
[1:34:43] what a great thing for god to do to take
[1:34:46] older people in that age
[1:34:48] and step them into a brand new body
[1:34:53] you see death does not win
[1:34:58] it does not win
[1:35:10] we live in a nation that exemplifies
[1:35:13] sodom and gomorrah
[1:35:16] we live in a nation that's forgot its
[1:35:18] roots
[1:35:19] a nation where on christmas day a man
[1:35:22] can get inspired
[1:35:24] to blow up a city or try to blow up a
[1:35:28] block of the city with no real reason
[1:35:33] insanities in the streets
[1:35:39] brother branham saw in in many of these
[1:35:42] visions of the tribulation period
[1:35:44] how great animals and great big great
[1:35:46] big things are going and
[1:35:48] how this all different kinds of worlds
[1:35:50] were taking place
[1:35:53] brother branham's day did not have the
[1:35:55] game world
[1:35:59] where little children can get so active
[1:36:02] in
[1:36:04] media and games
[1:36:07] and those games can absorb people
[1:36:10] and become addicted and it leaves
[1:36:14] children and then adults get involved in
[1:36:17] hours and days and weeks and gamers
[1:36:20] take on spirits and roles within games
[1:36:25] brother branham told us that rock and
[1:36:26] roll music was preparing
[1:36:28] people for the tribulation period
[1:36:33] let me just say this you be careful what
[1:36:35] you do with games in your home
[1:36:38] be careful what kind of music is played
[1:36:40] there
[1:36:41] our homes is to be filled with the holy
[1:36:44] ghost
[1:36:45] to be a boundary where we can walk in
[1:36:47] and take off our coats
[1:36:52] and rest in a sanctuary
[1:36:56] are you with me now
[1:37:02] hollywood is filthy
[1:37:08] is absolutely filthy
[1:37:12] and her filth has polluted the minds of
[1:37:16] people
[1:37:17] for decades songs of killing cops
[1:37:24] where marriages were
[1:37:27] were open marriages to where
[1:37:31] it was all right to sleep with others
[1:37:36] and so it made the modern churches
[1:37:41] have to bend and bow
[1:37:47] to the great herself
[1:37:50] before long the modern church couldn't
[1:37:52] preach on a dress code
[1:37:57] gender is no longer now just a birth
[1:38:01] situation
[1:38:04] and ministries have become so weak in
[1:38:07] the pulpit
[1:38:10] because of the love of money or the love
[1:38:13] of popularity
[1:38:16] or the love of a meta church or the love
[1:38:20] of media
[1:38:21] it is called pressures upon ministry
[1:38:25] to bend and bow
[1:38:29] are you with me and before long the
[1:38:31] church becomes
[1:38:32] dead and there's no life in it
[1:38:36] no call back to the original word of god
[1:38:42] whatsoever
[1:38:48] watch
[1:38:51] watch
[1:38:55] when the pope can announce that are now
[1:38:57] headed toward a one world
[1:38:59] currency one world
[1:39:02] church churches and nations are
[1:39:06] in the last weeks have looked to that
[1:39:09] like never before
[1:39:11] it's because they don't have an answer
[1:39:15] and i'll be very honest with you i'm not
[1:39:16] on a rant i'm not off of course here but
[1:39:19] let me just say this you our new
[1:39:21] president don't have an answer
[1:39:24] so many people are going what will his
[1:39:26] 100 days
[1:39:28] do he don't have an answer
[1:39:31] he'll change some things but he don't
[1:39:32] have an answer
[1:39:35] but brother on his agenda is bring us
[1:39:37] back to a greener earth
[1:39:39] well let me just say the coming king
[1:39:44] the coming king jesus
[1:39:48] he's going to bring us back to a greener
[1:39:50] earth
[1:39:51] where the oxygen will be pure again
[1:39:54] where the lamb will lay down with the
[1:39:57] line
[1:39:59] where there will be peace forever
[1:40:13] all right this is okay
[1:40:17] now you will discern what the prophet
[1:40:19] said
[1:40:21] in this day you will discern that evil
[1:40:23] spirit that fights you
[1:40:25] it'll not just fight you in church it'll
[1:40:28] not just
[1:40:28] fight you in your home it'll fight you
[1:40:30] daily even in your dreams
[1:40:33] but you'll discern where that spirit
[1:40:35] comes from
[1:40:36] and let me just say a spirit anybody
[1:40:39] susceptible to the spirit
[1:40:40] that's the reason the scripture tells us
[1:40:43] to try the spirits
[1:40:47] that gloomy spirit that comes on you
[1:40:49] sometimes
[1:40:50] that's not a god that depression that
[1:40:53] comes
[1:40:54] that's not a god that spirit that begins
[1:40:57] to tell you that god don't love you
[1:40:59] that's not of god the one that tells you
[1:41:03] that you're not a christian
[1:41:04] that's not of god
[1:41:08] now what you've got to do is discern
[1:41:11] where that spirit came from
[1:41:13] and knowing who you are and what you
[1:41:15] were sent here to do
[1:41:17] is turn him on his heels
[1:41:24] and send him away by the power of your
[1:41:28] voice
[1:41:31] god's asking you to speak to your
[1:41:35] mountain you speak
[1:41:38] it's fine to call brother ron but you
[1:41:40] speak
[1:41:42] you speak to that enemy get out of here

[1:42:00] of those others to be here today
[1:42:02] but he so happened to pick you to live
[1:42:04] in this day so quit being assistant

[1:43:24] we're going to have some clean out and
[1:43:26] we're going to overcome
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:30] brother man said god left some things
[1:43:32] for you to do
[1:43:36] now remember this book is full of
[1:43:38] promises
[1:43:40] and every promise in this book belongs
[1:43:42] to you
[1:43:49] every promise in this book belongs to
[1:43:51] you
[1:43:53] brother on i might be i have been fought
[1:43:55] fighting for a long time
[1:43:57] i've been fighting something that's been
[1:43:59] trying to take my life for a year
[1:44:01] and he has to be realizing by now
[1:44:04] he don't have enough
[1:44:28] i'm sure when satan was selecting a
[1:44:30] demon to fight me
[1:44:32] he didn't go down and get some wimp
[1:44:37] so mr devil if you're standing right
[1:44:39] here tonight so is an angel of god
[1:44:42] and that angel of god's got way more
[1:44:44] power than you do
[1:44:45] and you may have been the strongest
[1:44:47] demon that satan could sin
[1:44:49] but you are defeated in the name of
[1:44:52] jesus christ
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:45:00] hallelujah
[1:45:11] we are people that has crossed the
[1:45:12] breach from church ages and church after
[1:45:15] church after
[1:45:16] church we have crossed the breach of all
[1:45:19] of the ages
[1:45:20] into the church age of laodicea within
[1:45:23] it is a bright age
[1:45:24] and we're people of the bright age we're
[1:45:27] people of the open book
[1:45:29] we're influenced by the mighty angel
[1:45:31] christ
[1:45:32] himself come to live in this book and
[1:45:35] in our lives and we're written epistles
[1:45:40] we're anointed to speak the words of
[1:45:43] life
[1:45:46] and condemn the regions of hell

[1:45:55] men and women of god
[1:45:58] we stand in legacies and already in
[1:46:02] god's mind we stand there with the great
[1:46:04] generals
[1:46:06] so look past what you see
[1:46:11] look past what you see if your eyes is
[1:46:14] on this realm it's very temporary
[1:46:16] so look past what you see
[1:46:20] think past what you think
[1:46:34] i was in a meeting one morning about
[1:46:38] four o'clock
[1:46:46] with a very special presence
[1:46:50] in my office
[1:46:55] and i felt as though it was like
[1:47:00] i felt as though it was like
[1:47:04] abraham talking to him
[1:47:11] and abraham and his thoughts
[1:47:14] oh god
[1:47:20] in his thoughts he was thinking

[1:47:33] there's just no way and melchizedek said
[1:47:38] watch
[1:47:43] brother ray i felt like
[1:47:47] i felt like it was 10 000 volts of
[1:47:49] energy in that office
[1:47:54] and i actually felt like brother tim
[1:47:55] pruitt was just just just only feet away
[1:47:57] from me as well
[1:47:59] but there he was in bed
[1:48:03] you see with god there's no time or
[1:48:05] there's no space
[1:48:11] and let me just explain that to you
[1:48:14] where was you job
[1:48:18] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[1:48:23] and let me just catch you up just for a
[1:48:25] moment god didn't come down to
[1:48:27] job and talk to to him about his earthly
[1:48:30] conditions
[1:48:34] you're so consumed job
[1:48:39] people finances

[1:49:37] you the
[1:49:38] same voice that was speaking to job
[1:49:43] what got you here the same voice i spoke
[1:49:45] to job

[1:49:52] and there i was sitting
[1:49:55] and i had a question about esther
[1:49:58] brother tim pruitt's daughter
[1:50:02] i don't know if she'll hear this but i
[1:50:04] had a question in that presence about
[1:50:06] esther
[1:50:08] his daughter these were the words
[1:50:12] it's written down these were words
[1:50:15] i've got that taken care of
[1:50:20] but my thoughts are on the greater
[1:50:22] esther
[1:50:24] and i'll take care of her and listen
[1:50:27] within just days
[1:50:32] sister karen pruitt would have a what
[1:50:34] you would call a
[1:50:36] very death blow of a hemorrhage
[1:50:39] in her brain and the doctors were giving
[1:50:43] her
[1:50:43] zero chance
[1:50:46] and she's sitting in church right now
[1:50:49] praising the lord
[1:51:00] so what he does is he stops us sometimes
[1:51:04] he said
[1:51:05] it's not what you think
[1:51:08] it's not what you feel when you say
[1:51:12] there's
[1:51:13] no way watch
[1:51:21] oh i feel i have went from a very sick
[1:51:25] man
[1:51:25] to very feel very good right now
[1:51:36] i won't be but just a few more minutes
[1:51:39] but we are the vision of brother
[1:51:41] branham's vision
[1:51:42] of the bride fulfilled
[1:51:46] i'm not talking about in the four walls
[1:51:48] of this structure
[1:51:49] but around the world in every nation
[1:51:57] hallelujah we'll stand in our national
[1:52:00] colors
[1:52:01] and will stand and we'll come forth as
[1:52:04] the bride of jesus christ
[1:52:07] from every nation on the earth
[1:52:10] not a silly little girl
[1:52:13] not an up and down church but a powerful
[1:52:17] church cause we know who we are
[1:52:21] we've read the back of the book
[1:52:27] we fed on the body word we have become
[1:52:31] lived voices in this day
[1:52:40] sometimes it's just a quiet simple life
[1:52:43] brother ron i haven't done anything very
[1:52:45] supernatural
[1:52:48] brother branham said quiet
[1:52:51] simple life
[1:52:58] do you ever get a tug sometimes during
[1:53:00] the day to see
[1:53:03] would you just pray pray just now just
[1:53:05] pray just now
[1:53:07] and you don't even know what you're
[1:53:08] praying for
[1:53:10] and maybe you've got hundreds of people
[1:53:13] around you
[1:53:14] and you just and you just go into
[1:53:16] another realm
[1:53:18] and you just start praying maybe quietly
[1:53:21] maybe silently
[1:53:23] maybe openly and you begin to pray
[1:53:26] and you're going down the road and the
[1:53:29] spirit begins to give
[1:53:30] utterance and you move into another
[1:53:33] realm
[1:53:37] i love the statement last night
[1:53:40] i don't know exactly who who said it
[1:53:44] but it's not just you but your your
[1:53:47] entire family
[1:53:53] and there may be times that you think
[1:53:55] it'll never happen
[1:53:57] that that that lost loved one will never
[1:54:00] come in
[1:54:01] let me just say you would save him if
[1:54:03] you could
[1:54:06] but because you echo back to god
[1:54:10] your prayers and your intercession
[1:54:13] and you have a supreme authority to talk
[1:54:17] lip to ear to god
[1:54:21] you move mountains you cause
[1:54:24] walls to fall somebody help me preach
[1:54:29] chains come off of them doors come
[1:54:32] open because you
[1:54:35] and god have had a conversation
[1:54:38] in a moment of sacred sovereignty
[1:54:43] and you've moved into a channel
[1:54:56] now you see we're release potentials
[1:55:00] into the earth if i could just bring
[1:55:03] your mind to just
[1:55:05] watch as
[1:55:08] as god was in the church ages
[1:55:12] was releasing a messenger and paul would
[1:55:15] be the messenger to the first church age
[1:55:18] paul wouldn't be the only man that god
[1:55:20] would anoint
[1:55:24] he would be the prophet to that church
[1:55:26] age but there would be
[1:55:28] men drinking from the same hole
[1:55:31] baptizing the same all because there was
[1:55:34] a lot of work to go on
[1:55:35] that message had to go around the world
[1:55:38] it had to move out
[1:55:39] it had to prove power and demonstration
[1:55:42] there was life that was behind it
[1:55:46] irenaeus columba god was releasing
[1:55:50] from his hand that attributed to the
[1:55:54] earth
[1:55:54] and people would grab a hold of that
[1:55:57] word and in their age
[1:55:59] overcome that's what's happened in this
[1:56:02] generation
[1:56:04] god sent a messenger
[1:56:09] he sent elijah to the earth to turn your
[1:56:12] hearts
[1:56:15] but he also sent you into the earth
[1:56:18] pre-planning you to grab ahold of the
[1:56:22] message
[1:56:22] and overcome
[1:56:28] we don't need to be pumped up primed up
[1:56:31] the seed that god
[1:56:32] put inside of us has got the life and
[1:56:35] the potentials within itself
[1:56:38] to live it is predestinated
[1:56:43] we know where our resources are
[1:56:46] we know where our strength and our
[1:56:47] energies are and we are
[1:56:49] convinced we are persuaded
[1:56:54] we'll not turn back we'll not
[1:56:57] give up we'll not turn around
[1:57:02] there is no going back for us
[1:57:05] i say we're going forward and we're
[1:57:07] walking in the vision
[1:57:09] of the word of god
[1:57:11] [Applause]
[1:57:15] this is our day
[1:57:19] this is the day that the lord has made
[1:57:22] we will rejoice
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:30] and be glad in it hallelujah
[1:57:35] hallelujah oh glory to god

[1:57:48] what about in your home what about in
[1:57:50] your life

[1:57:54] sincere
[1:57:57] need to be more committed than ever
[1:57:59] before
[1:58:02] throw your pitchfork aside

[1:58:16] wanted to start in you

[1:59:10] we're looking for our bodies to change
[1:59:14] and lord sometimes we we ask the
[1:59:17] question we think
[1:59:21] how how will it happen
[1:59:27] and god just simply says stand still
[1:59:30] and see the salvation
