he's awesome andy yeah amen god bless you give him a good hand so good to see each and every one of you today and amen amen we love you with all of our hearts and just good to be here in it amen maybe just for a moment amen when andrew announced that we will not have service on christmas night i i was scared that he would announce that christmas is canceled i walk out to an empty building amen so love you with all of our hearts and so glad to see you each and every one of you and uh so glad to have you here i would like for you to to thank you for everything that you do every prayer that you pray and uh i thought last night was just an epic night i i to me that was probably my favorite sermon that i've heard from andrew and uh it was just it was just powerful right to the point and uh it was just awesome we want to remember brother william this week as he goes to his father's funeral his father died died of als and suffered just a short time with it but was it months it was like months with it yeah we remember that disease as being one of the most horrible diseases there is uh brother steve suffered with that disease and it's a disease that death becomes a very close friend and so and so we want to remember brother wiggum's family that god would just be with them and if every one of them is like brother william they're princes of a family amen i i i just we're so thrilled we're so benefited to having brother william and his wife and family with us the ministry that he brings the presence that he has uh we we so appreciate that and and and just just for just a moment let me just say this to you his daddy's life will live on in his family and and so his daddy was a voice of god translator and and so he translated for for 27 years and that is a tremendous responsibility within itself and just to give you an idea every word every comma everything has to be right and it can't have any of your own personal persuasion inside of it or ability to change it so his daddy was a businessman his daddy was a lot of things in life but what we'll live on is his daddy's work and that's what we're doing and and i'm prefacing all of that this morning that's what he will be remembered for and he has a tremendous family and uh i i was just sharing a couple of things with him uh andrew was singing out here and i said you know this message lives if it was all about the original generation and their experience then the next generation if they didn't have an experience it wouldn't live it just wouldn't live it's like for your children they've got to get the holy ghost for their self and every generation's got to have a revival if not they will just have a church entity and and it won't live on monday and then it won't live on tuesday and so and then it will just be a story book of the message or a storybook of the bible and and we don't want a tradition we want life and it's not just for our family but our family's family and our children's children god's going to have a rapture and in that rapture there's going to be children that are literally infants changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye there's going to be teenagers that are going to have the holy ghost that's going to get a translation and be moved from this dimension to another dimension we're we're we're seeing it happen we're not just looking for it to come but we're seeing it happen around the world and and so we're just thankful for that uh i just want to say william we're praying for you and he's going to he's going to be speaking in that brother williams father would watch him preach and i'm sure from here and when when william would speak that his father was extremely proud of him and exp extremely proud of what the young man that he has become and so amen so god bless you brother william as you take your journey and and uh and we just will be praying for you as you speak there and those that do speak brother william is the only he's out of 12 children and 13 children god bless you and he's the only son that's a minister and so i'm sure as he watched his son preach that meant the world to him amen that's where i wanted to go with that by the way and god bless you amen i am supposed to be at brother danny stevens today this weekend and due to a variety of reasons i'm not there and because of some of the treatments that we're doing and because of my strength it's not where it really needs to be to to go and i've got so a couple of other meetings that i had to cancel as well they're still upcoming but we've already we've already made mention that they're not going to happen but i would like for you to remember that meeting brother danny's meeting today and brother tim pruitt is preaching there this morning and he preached yesterday and then they canceled last night's service and and because i wasn't there but they've had a tremendous meeting anyway we sure love brother danny and his family i remember when i first went to brother danny's church i to that little hub of a community i thought i just went to heaven they are such wonderful people and so so we love brother danny with all of our hearts brother jason jackson's going to be with us next weekend and we love brother jason with all of our hearts i remember when i first went to brother jason's church it was about 40 people and now it's probably about 200 strong men so i told him then about 40 i said you're going to be a blessed church and you're going to fill up and so they're full up so we're just thankful god's blessed brother jason and his ministry there and and so we're looking forward to to everything that he's doing and so amen these brothers all they all are very uh thoughtful and and appreciative and uh they've been very understanding when when we've had to cancel and and so we appreciate your prayers we're we're we're we're just we're just in that season of our life and we're in a battle and we're in a war and we continue to take the chemo treatments every day it's on in the morning and then about about about eight hours later we take our second chemo treatment that second one's gen generally a booger but uh we we god's give us strength and we got news this week that we're getting ready to have to start another type of chemo treatment on top of the one that we're already on i don't know why i just know that we're we're in a battle and uh and uh they say it's pretty rough deal but you know hey this one was supposed to be a real rough deal too so god's given strength he's give us mercy and i've been asked about the pen that i that i have on my jacket and then i'll just take a minute this is okay the pen i carry on my i have on my jacket is a hope pen and the cancer has struck a lot of people in life and and so we need hope we need strength and so if i can be a if i can be a help to anybody in the world that maybe don't even believe the message but they hear our story and so and so i i was just sitting in the in the waiting room the other day for two hours and it was two old fellas sitting in there and they were talking about what a tough time that they were having and and they were just really giving it some complaining and they were going on one was about 80 one was about 65 and they were talking about how difficult time they were having and they had cancer in their eye and so we were in the eye clinic and and we were there and so i just kind of let them go we were there for a couple hours together and so they were just going they were both neighbors from mechanicsville and which is down below richmond and they were sitting there and they they just kind of related a lot of old times and so you know after a bit they were complaining quite a bit and he finally the old fellow looked over at and said what are you here for i said well i had cancer in my eye and i said then monitor it i said but the cancer went from my eye to my lymph nodes and then to my lungs and then to my brain and i said i'm on chemo twice a day and the old guy looked over to the other guy and he said no more complaining amen no more complaining amen god bless you amen i love you hope you don't mind me taking a couple of moments there i i wore the suit last night that uh brother george quinn gave me uh many years ago maybe eight years ago in in ireland and today i'm wearing his ties so so maybe so this is the george quinn weekend so amen god bless you if you will stand with me this morning i certainly love you with all of our hearts and and we want to pray for the meetings that are upcoming and all that's going on did i miss anything andrew all right all right god bless you first john chapter 1 and verse 1 i visited this subject it came to me in 2015 and so i want to revisit and speak to you from from where i'm standing and i want to speak to you in in as brief as i can on what will you be remembered for sister cassie wrote a song from this this sermon then after delivering this sermon and maybe this will be your case today after delivering this sermon in switzerland one of the greatest miracles that i've ever personally saw and witnessed took place at the end of the service with brother bisical and so this sermon has power so if you can just pay close attention and pull on the word this morning amen just feeling very led and and just waited on this day and we will go back and revisiting last week's sermon again but i just felt to drop this today and so so we believe it's of the lord first john chapter 1 and verse 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled the word of life that's an eternal word for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full maybe have a need on your heart you just like to lift it before the lord today and say lord come touch my heart today lord jesus we love you with all of our hearts and lord we can just feel your presence even now we ask you that you would minister to us you see our hands lifted requests behind every hand loved ones job situations spiritual conditions father you're a god that takes a service and and just answers in so many ways i ask you for strength in my body today i ask you that you would anoint us today lord may my mind be sharp and clear help us today we pray in jesus christ's name we ask amen and amen and amen god bless you you may be seated what will you be remembered for it's quite a powerful thought because a man lives his life and sometimes it's short sometimes it's very brief sometimes it's extended but if you lived a hundred years it's very brief in the time of eternity millionaires have lived their life and been great businessmen this actually the serve this actual sermon came to me when i was standing in the grave of of where that columbus church was at and i was standing in front of a deacon's a deacon's grave and that's that's been about 14 to 1500 years ago and i and and and i was standing in front of it and and no no way in the world his name was already at a point to where you couldn't read it because time had taken away and but at the bottom of it of the deacon of the church and i thought what a statement that is made i was a standard of this church the message of the hour at that time and i was a i i was a pillar of this church it don't talk about his business it don't talk about his lifestyle it don't talk about his children and don't even talk about his wife god sometimes will allow chapters even books to be written in the bible as it's more than a history book the greatest book that's ever been written god will allow men their name their temporary life their their names like moses it'll it'll encompass books david will be mentioned in many books of the bible elijah and all of those but there's men like shamgar that will be mentioned in one scripture and and the prophet would go back and grab his name now now their life you would want to know that about the eternal part of them what they did what their job was you don't know too much about only unless it's written but in our day what will you and i be remembered for i certainly hope that i won't be remembered as a as a a fighter of cancer amen i i just have to say this and i i just thought i i'd like to have a statement written and i and i just i just came to this thought and i thought i would deliver it i'm honored in all of this journey that i've been on that god had confidence that i would fight this battle and i would not give in and i would not i would not worship the spirit of cancer but i would contest it and fight it every day and it would be a journey that i would be on and that journey is good days bad days for an example thursday was a horrendous day for me but that didn't make me quit church last night you get back up and you fight through the day i'm reminded that it was in a cave we don't need a thousand people with us but it was in a cave with two incredible beings one was the angel of the lord and the other was the prophet to this age and he was reminded that if you can get the people to believe if you can get them to believe now i understand even the disease that i thought was mentioned by brother brennaman not the angel not even cancer would stand before the prayers so this disease does not have eternal value to it are you with me so we raise our head above the disease that we fought and and and i just i just want to relay this to you if you'll remember before the journey even started or we knew that we had it god spoke to us and said if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before now i want you to just think and i i i'm sorry i'm going to just talk out loud for a few moments if you could just think of the battle that god chose it would be the battle to which that was mentioned in the cave it would be a battle to where that is it causes incredible devastations to homes and families and to physical characteristics god would not the battle would not be great missions trusted with great missions or great camp meetings but it would be a private battle so if we're going to fight this battle and jesus is with us may we inspire may we speak confidence and courage to the people that suffer this battle may they know that jesus is a healer every day now there's no way that you could understand what i'm saying right there unless you fought it there's no way because no man knows another man's battle until you begin to do it nobody knows what chemo does to you until you've actually had to fight it nobody knows what the times of doctors and all of those kinds of things is until you have to go through it you search for inspiration you search for every scripture you search for every quote that will give you strength for your daily battle it causes you to pray more than you've ever prayed you realize that every day could be your last day you realize with god all things are possible we can have visions to where that we see yourself well but between hearing the visions a journey that you got to battle through i just want to drop something to you here just for a moment there's a man named jimmy valvano henry's ever heard that name jimmy valvano was north carolina state head coach in the 80s he became popular and he was struck with cancer and he's actually the espn does a espy's award and uh they jimmy valvano as he had tumors all over him and he gave a speech that speech lasted 11 minutes and 19 seconds yes i've watched it a few times it was given on march the 3rd of 1993 all of the people of of the community of the sports world the celebrities were there and they brought him up and he quickly tells them that i'm going to be the longest speech of the day and he begins to share a couple things and i want to i want to just share some things with you he says he said there's three things that you've got to do every day laugh think and cry he says if you do those three things every day you've had a full day it's important that you remember where you started at and where you are and where you're going he had a role model named lombardi and he tried to emulate that and so from that i'm going to take a sermon i have a role model and i have a champion he said there's three things that you've got to keep in your life and that's your family your religion and what you really care about in life he said you've got to enjoy every precious moment and you got to keep dreams alive i'm sharing this with you i know it has no spiritual value to you but for those that are fighting it may it encourage them give hope to others he ends the speech on don't give up don't ever give up don't give up don't ever give up this would be his last speech that he want but something that caught my attention in it the reason that i started here i actually told andrew and william before service i said don't think that i'm off course but but i'm going to just deliver this this morning i want to take a part of jimmy valvano speech and i just want to share it with you and i did but in the middle of being being it was a television production they had a guy back there that was flashing a screen 30 more seconds 30 more seconds and they were trying to get him to stop and he just stops and he laughs at that guy yeah he said you're trying to get me to stop give me 30 more seconds he said i've only got a few more minutes in my life anyway do you really think i'm going to pay attention to your sign 30 more seconds i wonder sometimes when we come to church do we really take it as much as we appreciate thousands of people sat and listened to probably one of the greatest speeches ever given by a man that was eat up with cancer and they actually almost had to carry him to the stage and he delivers his speech and they're wanting him to hurry up so i'm going to preach there are celebrities in hell that would love to hear the sermon that i'm about to deliver today [Applause] and if they could be able to step from that dimension and step to this dimension they would love to have the next hour to change the history of their life because their life has been written and it has a finality to it but if they could come and sit in a church like this service and instead of being known as jezebel instead of being known as elvis presley instead of being known as marilyn monroe instead of being known as herodias instead of being known as a trader and jambress instead of being known as as someone like demas that paul would write about demas has forsaken me if they could breathe life again and step back into a body even that they send in and be able to have the opportunity they would give it all and i'm saying give it all now let me just say alexander the great can't come herod can't come pilate can't come the greatest presidents that's ever lived would love to set where you're sitting at now brother branham said even jacqueline kennedy she never got to come and hear what you sisters have got to hear but if she heard she might have given her heart to the lord knowing that she was a woman of wealth and a woman of dignity way before john f kennedy it was an arranged marriage you know that i'm not telling you anything but she never heard the prophet's voice but let me just say this you there are people that hurt at one time and it anchored their life forever it anchored it forever men that just sit and listen and sitting with their friends they sit and listen to the word as brother branham was preaching in the live meeting and they said that's a prophet others made fun and and walked out of it brother biscuit said one of his dearest friends was sitting beside of him in church and he went a complete different way brother jonah empty's father said in a meeting and didn't know it was his first live ministry meeting that he'd ever been in didn't know anything hardly about church only thing he knew was his girlfriend was a real christian and she invited him to the meeting and he hears brother branham for the first time and he said that man's a prophet so you don't have to argue for years to figure out if he's a prophet or not lives go so quickly the rich young ruler would like to have your place today pilate would like to wash the hands of jesus christ off of him branham mentions an incredible story about a man that was in shreveport he said there is no such thing as god he blasphemed he said they're nothing but a bunch of holy rollers and lightning killed that man and they took him to the grave and when they was burying that man there come up a little bitty cloud and lightning struck the casket and blowed that man plum out of the casket he makes a statement he said jehovah god gets angry i know he's a good god but he's a he's a god of judgment too he still looks he knows brother madam immediately just before that he tells of another story of a girl that was in and out of church and in and out of church and she knowed what was right but she she refused to do right she was a a smoker and she refused to do right and he said lightning struck her charles spurgeon was walking with a childhood friend in his teenage years and lightning struck his friend walking down the street with him charles spurgeon dedicated the rest of his life to jesus christ because that same lightning strike could have took him let me just say this to you it may have not been lightning come in your life i was struck by light and it hit the tree and hit me and knocked the end off my weed eater let me just say this to you didn't see it coming didn't know it was going to happen but i'm thankful to be standing here today brother bam turns after he says that he says if you're without god raise your hand say remember me brother branham and as you pray god bless you lady god bless you son that's right come ahead now god bless you that's right young man god bless you back there he said you ask almighty god our heavenly father now you sing them you know there's 20 30 hands that's been up and they want you as their savior god grant that just now i i give them his word you said yourself he that heareth my word i've done my best that i could with it lord he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but has passed from death and to life what a wonderful thing to think if sincere hearts behind those hands really meant that something just happened now you said he that that will confess me before men will i confess them before my father and his holy angels let them know that thou art here lord i pray that you will grant it hear us we are your servants lord in jesus name i want to just capture the moment that you're sitting in just now i don't know where you're at maybe people that are watching by way of by the internet maybe they haven't given their heart to god and maybe their life is now telling a story that they wouldn't even want their mother and father to know many times people hide sicker things in their life you heard me preach on naaman the other day living a secret life let me just say sin will take you further than you ever thought you'd go you make a step towards sin he will destroy your life satan has nobody to negotiate with he destroys families he destroys homes he destroys flesh [Applause] prison sets full of people that made one horrible error in their life they were good people moral people but temper got a hold of them or jealousy got a hold of them and one day changed their life can i say one day can change a christian's life you once were a lot of bad things in your life but one day when jesus speaks and drives a hole to your life never to be the same ever again [Applause] i have a lot of friends that are great preachers because we are in the golden age and the opening of the word god has given us the greatest message that you could be given there's a lot of men that preach the gospel that don't live it but i am i am thrilled to be a part of a select group of men i have zero confidence in a man that can't live it i have zero confidence but i stand shoulder to shoulder sometimes my shoulders much shorter than the other shoulders but i stand shoulder to shoulder to the men that carry the message of the hour and they have a desire to keep it pure and to keep it holy to stand and preach the breath of god to an audience whether it's 10 people or thousands of people and they stand and they give their life yes and literally they become a instrument through which god can breathe through and from their life god breathes through them and and and it is more than just a reproduction of inspiration of man or personality but jesus christ wants us so in tabernacle and individual until when he preaches there becomes a thirst for that same life lived on the inside you don't want my personality lived on the inside of you you want the life of jesus christ lived on the inside of you are you with me if you get my personality you'll get my failures so never elevate a man into lordship or kingship but we are deeply respectful to the great men of god but none of them could pay for their own sins even our prophet couldn't pay for his own sins he needed a champion he needed an intercessor he needed a great king himself so god left the portals of glory and let me just say this to you this man there will never be enough books written about him there will never be enough stories red earth even reproduced about him this man is jesus you've heard me read it before i want to read it to you again when i fall he lifts me up when i fail he forgives me when i am weak he is strong when i am lost he is the way when i am afraid he is my courage when i'm stumble he steadies me when i am hurt he leads me when i am broken he mends me when i am blind he leads me when i am hungry he feeds me when i face trials he is with me when i face persecution he shields me when i face problems he comforts me when i face loss he provides for me when i face death he carries me home this friend goes further than any other man can go he is god he is faithful and i am his and he is mine god is in control i am on this that's his side and that means that all is well with my soul doctor's reports tell me a lot of different things but i've got another report who hath believed i report into whom is the arm of the lord revealed isaiah 53 and 1 he says for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no formula calmness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hear to say if our faces from him and he is despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs are you awake carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the lord is my shepherd and i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures and he leadeth me beside of the still waters he restoreth my soul and he leadeth me in the past of righteousness for his name's sake and yea though i walk through the valley of death i'm living that yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with all right my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever psalms 24 and verse 7 lift up your heads on your gates and be you lifted up you everlasting doors for the kingdom of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads over your gates and even lift them up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory israel don't know it yet but we have him as our king are you with me now this world's had a lot of kings and a lot of presidents and a lot of dictators but there's never been a king like king jesus [Applause] what makes it so incredible we are his queen he just wasn't thinking about himself but he was thinking about you when he slept the wedding ban a predestination on you before the foundation of the world he didn't get you just to lose you [Applause] god's the kind of businessman that don't quit he don't turn around and go away if he ever follow you he'll never unseat you [Applause] the other day i was getting ready to have a very difficult day i didn't i'm gonna tell this backwards but i was getting ready to have a very difficult day sometimes you don't know how difficult day because the cancer started in my eye that's where they look and they're on all kinds of scans and then they run they run laser they run a real high beam lights to look at the back end of my eye i'll just tell you how it is there's eight spots on the back of my eye and and they're constantly watching those eight spots are they growing are they multiplying and to be honest with you there are some tests that are more than you can take and they put my head in a machine and they hold my head they kind of hold it and i was like a bull in a i was like a bull in it the other day and it was more than i could take and i backed my head out of there and the doctor said put that head back in there and i said it's more than i can take i'm sorry i i just can't take any more of this he said put that head back in there i put my head back in and repeated it and repeated it and for about the next 20 minutes they they look with that intense light into my eye i cried like a baby i'll just have to be honest with you i cried like a baby sister connie was in the car because i couldn't get in and so i cried like the baby i texted her i i told i called her i said i'm on my way and i said i'm just i'm just feeling and i literally felt my way down the wall and i got to the elevator i got in the elevator and i actually pushed three buttons and i got off at the one that i thought it should get off of it so happened it was right and i made my way out came out into the sunlight and i was just bawling i literally got in the van and i was just bawling i was bawling he told me some difficult news and then i would i would go to another doctor and and she would talk to me a bit and some changing things that's getting ready to happen you know that's a doctor's report that's the way they look at things but at 4 30 in the morning not gonna be much longer but i'm hot but at 4 30 in the morning i i got up out of bed and i was awake as i am right now i'm starting to get a little age on me so i go to bed early and so if you call if you call me after nine o'clock you'll get my answering machine i'm not gonna apologize for that and so you know i just simply turn it off and and i go to bed and so at 4 30 the other morning i i climbed out of i climbed out of bed and i was just standing there and all of a sudden i see a vision and i was standing in a white shirt and black pants that's interesting and andrew was standing in a white shirt black pants we didn't have her ties on and wayne lawson was standing in a white shirt and black pants we were together and and i had wavy hair sister heather knows a little picky with my hair and chemo's made it real kinky so when i saw the vision that i had longer wavy hair really made me feel good but it was still gray and so we were at a we were at a coffee shop that had pastries and i looked over and there was a honey bun there that the syrup was just running off of listen i'm a honey bun aficionado if you could if that's a word i know in one bite if that baby's good or not that's all it takes one bite and if it's good i'll eat the rest of it if it's not it goes in trash bin 101. now it ain't worth the calories that got to go in that baby and i told the lady behind the counter i said i'll have that honey bun and brother wayne was standing beside of me and he says brother ron he said are you sure you can have that and i turned to brother wayne in the vision i said oh i don't have cancer no more [Applause] hallelujah and we might as well get two devils at the same time if i could have that honey bun that means i don't have sugar diabetes no more so let me just say this to you god gave me a vision knowing what the day was going to hold how difficult it was going to be so he gave me his report first and thursday was a wicked day after wednesday but i keep going back to he showed me time and time again brother branham patting me on the cheek you're going to be well ron and god has reminded us in of his promises in the word over 3 000 promises in this word and he's never failed on any of them now i want to say this to you this morning there may be difficult chapters in your book help me i'm going to finish here in just a second there may be difficult chapters in your book there may be a cancer chapter a lost loved one chapter there may be some difficult roads if you've got to go through but remember you're not the writer god's watched over you and grace rewrote your book hallelujah he rewrote it what was my king doing when he was carrying that cross he was paying for my redemption what was he doing when he was being beaten like any other unlike any other human being that's ever been beaten he was paying for my healing thank you so what you do is you take his word you don't take your feelings you don't take your emotions you take his word and you take his promises and you confess his promises and they're everyone true and you don't mix emotions in with it you take his promises to defeat the devil because like my battle it's an unseen battle it's a it's a it's a you don't do it with flesh and blood affair you do it because it's a spiritual warfare cancer is a spiritual demon but it has been defeated over and over and over and over again [Applause] brother ron how long do you think you'll find it i'll fight it till i win [Applause] i'll enjoy every day that god gives me i'll enjoy every moment i'll appreciate my loved ones coming being with me i appreciate every moment i'm at a stage now that i appreciate every day i love my grandchildren coming around i enjoy hearing the noise they don't get on my nerves i enjoy hearing the noise i enjoy their presence i enjoy walking to this pulpit and preaching to you as a body of believers i'm sorry i can't travel a lot of places and preach the word but i value the moment that i stand here and preach to you what i spoke and what will you be remembered for six years ago and sister cassidy would write a song about it brother biscuit at the end of this service would recognize more than a man was preaching and a phenomenal miracle happened there with brother biskell and his family i've related to you about jimmy valvano and the people that said in the audience didn't appreciate what was going on maybe the people in hell would love to have your seat this morning i related that to you we could talk about rich young ruler that missed his opportunity or demas walking away there was a young girl that said in brother branham's meeting and she raised up and became a sunday school teacher and she got to running around on her husband well she left church brother brown said she grieved her soul away from her so she could just do anything she wanted to do so she went to another church she became a sunday school teacher there and she ran off with another man and it repeated itself over and over and over again brother man would use this and i'm just going to just bring some story to a couple different things to you he said you you go away and he said your soul you grieve it away and then you do what you want to do but once in a while your soul will come back to you and it'll haunt you he said brother on i don't live i don't believe in ghosts they're real it's like a man dying that don't have jesus his soul wanders his soul wonders and and it'll and it can't find peace so his soul wonders not everybody's going to heaven folks let me just drop it to you not everybody's going and this girl had came to the spot to where she grieved her soul away and now she's coming to die brother ram lived long enough to watch this phase take place and

okay she know better she knowed better get brother branham get brother brandon get brother branham and her preacher couldn't bring her satisfaction he was telling her she was all right she knowed

your life let's stand hello i like it when you come to church and you feel like you've been on a journey kind of feels that way you just kind of went on a journey today jesus would leave it up to his disciples to write his story he wouldn't have time to write it he would leave it up to his disciples and they wrote it and all agreed that he walked on water they saw it happen they wrote it that he turned water into wine not just a cup but in one place it says 62 gallons of water turned into wine which was the best wine in the world which one writer says was worth millions of dollars so he not only for the evening turned the water into wine for them he also gave them a lifelong legacy of wine now what he does for you was when he pours his wine or the holy ghost on the inside of you he gives you a lifelong journey not just enough to tickle you for the afternoon not enough just to make you happy for this evening or this morning but he gives it to you for the rest of your life ain't that
