[46:44] have the entire Ray family here with us
[46:47] and there's not enough words that we
[46:49] could say and brother Ron's already said
[46:52] some words but there's not enough words
[46:53] that we could say what the ray family
[46:56] means to us here at Full Gospel
[46:58] Lighthouse because we've seen what God
[47:01] has done through brother Michaels his
[47:03] ministry how the Lord we've witnessed
[47:05] how the Lord has abundantly blessed his
[47:07] ministry how the Lord has used him so
[47:10] mightily already around the world and

[47:42] for brother Tom
[47:44] Ray we wouldn't be here tonight if it
[47:47] wasn't for a night on the street in
[47:50] Victoria this church would be completely
[47:53] different but because a man was so
[47:55] influenced by the Holy Ghost he was so
[47:57] LED and the Dynamics of this church

[52:14] a god of fashion but we serve a living
[52:16] God that placed within us a life oh God

[53:00] Lord I desire tonight that we could be
[53:02] caught up in the vortex of your purpose
[53:04] tonight Lord that you just swirl around

[53:19] everyone in this in this little room in
[53:21] this Sanctuary we pray we dedicate the
[53:24] service we dedicate Lord all that would
[53:26] be said and spoken to you in the
[53:28] precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[53:33] amen amen God bless
[53:37] you there's so much that could be said
[53:39] right now but we'll turn to our Bibles
[53:42] as as we would just want to get into the
[53:45] word I I can't as you turn to
[53:50] Ephesians I wrote down the very exact
[53:52] same word brother Ron our fam's years
[53:55] and Supernatural events have intertwined
[53:57] our
[53:58] families I wrote those very down those
[54:01] words down God has threaded our families
[54:04] together Supernatural threading and I I
[54:08] just I you know I wrote I just said I
[54:10] Marvel which Marvel means to be filled
[54:13] with wonder and that's really what my
[54:16] heart is just filled with wonder because
[54:18] you can just step back and say Lord I
[54:20] don't know what you're doing but I just
[54:22] want to be following in exactly what
[54:24] you're Desiring to be done I don't need
[54:26] to know I don't need to be told what
[54:28] tomorrow holds I just want to be in step
[54:30] with where you're leading us so Lord may
[54:33] he lead and guide this congregation and
[54:35] continue to pour His Spirit here we my
[54:38] goodness we're maybe many thousands of
[54:40] miles apart but it's like we're
[54:43] connected quite close distance don't
[54:45] matter nothing so eternity is already
[54:47] stepping down because eternity distance
[54:49] means nothing and so we're already just
[54:51] stepping into that little into that
[54:53] place amen and my brother Andrew you've
[54:57] impacted my family very specifically
[54:59] Lord only knows these things and you're
[55:01] so special to
[55:03] us I just there's just too much I just
[55:06] don't even know I'm just humbled to be
[55:07] here humbled to be standing here behind
[55:09] this Paul Actually I don't even know how
[55:10] I even can got here brother
[55:12] R how a few years back I could I just
[55:15] don't even know how I could even uh I
[55:17] would never have imagined this but you
[55:20] know and you can just submit yourself to
[55:21] the
[55:23] Lord you can have all the desires you
[55:25] want in the
[55:27] world but when he has his desires well
[55:31] it can be going in the total opposite
[55:32] direction and I can pre I can definitely
[55:34] stand and testify but there's no other
[55:36] place I'd rather be I just want to be in
[55:38] the perfect will of God Amen and so Lord
[55:41] Just Have Your Way tonight as we just
[55:43] Fellowship around the word and just see
[55:46] what the Lord desires to do tonight amen
[55:48] Ephesians
[55:51] 6 very familiar
[55:54] scripture I tried to
[55:57] uh you know the preachers behind me
[56:01] would know you try to maybe pull away
[56:03] from a thought and you just try to move
[56:06] yourself away I just couldn't get away
[56:08] and this dropped in my heart several um
[56:11] well a few months ago now and it just
[56:13] hasn't never left me and so the Lord
[56:15] will have his way tonight Ephesians
[56:18] 6:12 for I wrestle not against flesh and
[56:21] blood but against principalities against
[56:24] Powers against the rulers of the dark
[56:26] dark nness of this world against
[56:27] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[56:30] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[56:32] of God that you may be able to withstand
[56:34] in the evil day and having done all to
[56:38] stand I'm just so amazed at how that was
[56:41] written by Paul because he puts a period
[56:43] there and it's just the most odd way to
[56:46] end end end a verse and so it but it
[56:49] just makes you really stop there for a
[56:51] second and then forces you to the next
[56:53] verse for when having done all to stand
[56:56] you have to go to the next part stand
[57:00] therefore there ain't no just stopping
[57:02] at that period even though it's put
[57:03] there but it's put there and you you
[57:05] must go to the next verse stand
[57:07] therefore having your loins G about with
[57:09] truth having on the breastplate of
[57:11] righteousness and your feet shod with
[57:12] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[57:15] and above all taking the shield of Faith
[57:17] wherewith you able to quench all the
[57:19] fiery darts of the wicked amen so I want
[57:22] to just take the stand therefore if you
[57:25] just keep that in your hearts turn to
[57:26] Isaiah
[57:35] 21-11 also another very familiar
[57:40] scripture well I what's not a familiar
[57:45] scripture they should all be familiar
[57:47] maybe maybe some deep deep line in
[57:49] Chronicles where you forgot somebody's
[57:51] name or something like that that's
[57:52] understandable
[57:54] but but here this is another scripture
[57:57] the burden of Duma he calleth to me out
[57:59] of SE Watchmen what of the night
[58:04] Watchmen repeated what of the night and
[58:07] the Watchman said the morning cometh and
[58:10] also the night if you will inquire
[58:13] inquire ye return come ien the Lord have
[58:18] his blessings of the reading the word
[58:19] you may be seated
[58:25] tonight
[58:30] we're familiar with the I'm sure the
[58:32] message Watchman what of the
[58:34] night scripture saying the morning
[58:36] cometh and also the night and we know it
[58:38] would be an understatement for me to
[58:40] take tonight and to say that we liveing
[58:41] in Dark Times amen we're all aware of
[58:44] the of the of the darkness I should say
[58:46] the political Darkness the religious
[58:48] Darkness the entertainment Darkness the
[58:50] education Darkness it's just straight up
[58:52] Darkness amen it's and and it's
[58:54] fulfilling scripture but br says the
[58:56] coming of the Lord is at hand how how
[58:59] many times would that have been said by
[59:01] a prophet the coming of the Lord is at
[59:02] hand amen and how many people missed
[59:05] that line I read that line just today
[59:06] and I just thought my goodness Lord help
[59:08] me just catch that one sentence right
[59:10] there the coming of the Lord is at hand
[59:12] right here today amen we're in his
[59:14] coming and and the he said the judgments
[59:16] God spoke of he said the people would
[59:19] get to a place they'd Fall Away gross
[59:21] Darkness would cover the earth when
[59:23] spiritual Darkness gets upon the Earth
[59:25] it's time time for the enemy to attack
[59:29] think about it gr darkness is here it's
[59:31] upon the Earth he said it's time for the
[59:34] enemy to attack where're at the hour
[59:37] gross Darkness now I don't know if
[59:40] anybody's really looked at that word
[59:41] before because it says in Isaiah 60 and2
[59:44] for Behold The Darkness shall cover the
[59:46] Earth and gross Darkness the people okay
[59:50] so you're like well what's the
[59:51] difference scripture says this but the
[59:52] Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory
[59:55] shall be seen upon the well Darkness if
[59:57] you look at the word is misery
[59:59] destruction death ignorance sorrow and
[1:00:02] wickedness obscurity a confusion and
[1:00:05] uncertainty that's Darkness Welcome To
[1:00:09] Earth here we are but gross darkness is
[1:00:13] a little bit different it's a darkness
[1:00:15] that actually can be
[1:00:18] felt think about it and gross Darkness
[1:00:21] on the people a darkness that actually
[1:00:24] can be felt almost if I could say a
[1:00:26] pressure of Darkness okay that's what
[1:00:29] you're living there's a pressure of
[1:00:31] Darkness it has this ability or it has
[1:00:33] an objective to oppress itself or an
[1:00:36] oppressive objective to bring you to a
[1:00:38] succumbing aspect or to to to Cave you
[1:00:41] in or if I could say to
[1:00:44] surrender okay grows Darkness it's an
[1:00:46] oppressive it's a pressure that we live
[1:00:49] in if I Define surrender because that's
[1:00:51] really what the darkness is trying to do
[1:00:53] to you is trying to oppress itself or
[1:00:56] press itself onto you to make you bend
[1:00:59] and Cave to the darkness of this world
[1:01:02] that's where we live I know what it's
[1:01:04] like here in Elton but I can tell you
[1:01:06] it's gross darkness in Vancouver
[1:01:08] terrible Darkness amen and so it's
[1:01:10] looking for you to surrender your will
[1:01:13] and your desires and and every aspect of
[1:01:15] your life but that surrender is to cease
[1:01:19] resistance think about it gross darkness
[1:01:21] is trying to get you to a place where
[1:01:24] you cease resistance which would be
[1:01:26] completely contrary to scripture which
[1:01:28] says resist the devil and he will flee
[1:01:31] so gross darkness is trying to come into
[1:01:33] the into this age upon you and I and try
[1:01:36] to get you to a place where you cease to
[1:01:42] resist it's looking for you to submit to
[1:01:46] their Authority this is surrendering if
[1:01:49] you surrender your submitting to
[1:01:50] somebody's Authority you're ceasing to
[1:01:52] to push back it's to give something
[1:01:54] that's yours and to give to somebody
[1:01:57] else you're surrendering something over
[1:01:59] because you've been forced to do so
[1:02:01] because it's necessary to do so or
[1:02:04] they're so they're saying to you this is
[1:02:05] necessary to do surrender to me right
[1:02:08] now and so that's that's what surrender
[1:02:10] is or it's to give in it's to give up
[1:02:13] it's to yield or concede it's to submit
[1:02:15] or climb down give way defer acence back
[1:02:19] down cave in relent succumb or just
[1:02:21] plain old
[1:02:22] quit hopefully one of those hit
[1:02:24] everybody today
[1:02:26] somebody got one of those words that is
[1:02:29] one of the synonyms for all the teachers
[1:02:31] of surrender and from every angle and
[1:02:33] Direction every side there's a pressure
[1:02:37] there's a force gross darkness that is
[1:02:39] upon the land to put you into a bowing
[1:02:42] state or a bending state to the devices
[1:02:45] and the desires of this world Amen would
[1:02:48] everybody agree it's there to put your
[1:02:50] thinking Under Pressure the way Society
[1:02:53] thinks the way culture thinks the the
[1:02:54] different ways that they're they're
[1:02:56] trying to press you to to to look at how
[1:02:58] life is in this day and age and whatever
[1:03:00] it is in our social cultures and and
[1:03:02] different things it's trying to put in
[1:03:03] bend your thinking or Surrender your
[1:03:06] thinking to its
[1:03:09] will that's where it's at your words and
[1:03:12] expressions it's there it's under
[1:03:14] pressure at work you're certain certain
[1:03:16] things you can say certain actions
[1:03:17] you're allowed to do parents certain
[1:03:19] ways you're allowed to discipline your
[1:03:20] children these days it's not you're not
[1:03:22] allowed to do this no more you can't do
[1:03:24] this or you can't do that and so the
[1:03:26] world is trying to force you Satan is
[1:03:28] trying to force you to bend yourself
[1:03:31] away from the very word of God Amen he's
[1:03:34] trying to get you to cease your
[1:03:36] resistance to his
[1:03:37] way that's the gross Darkness amen so
[1:03:42] you that's why you come home at the end
[1:03:44] of a work day and you're just pling old
[1:03:47] Tapped Out you know a husband comes home
[1:03:49] from workers and and he's just rung out
[1:03:52] cu you're under pressure it's there just
[1:03:54] to pressure is anybody ever had
[1:03:56] something heavy fall on them and it's
[1:03:58] just or anybody ever had a heart attack
[1:04:00] not I thankfully but you'll feel a
[1:04:02] pressure it starts to squeeze you you
[1:04:04] feel like there's an 80 PB elephant just
[1:04:06] ready to squish you it is squishing you
[1:04:08] it's pressure it's not is it a good
[1:04:10] feeling no it is not it makes you do
[1:04:15] things that you never really intended
[1:04:18] Under Pressure it's actually a force
[1:04:21] that's there that's upon you to maybe
[1:04:22] maybe you don't maybe not even knowing
[1:04:24] there that there is that Force but it's
[1:04:26] real cuz I'll even just just just flip
[1:04:28] it on a bit of a side you know anybody
[1:04:30] that does Sports and you're like oh man
[1:04:32] they choked Under
[1:04:34] Pressure people have had some major
[1:04:37] mishaps because they get in the moment
[1:04:39] there's some well for everybody here
[1:04:41] that's maybe a football fan would
[1:04:42] remember back in the day when the team
[1:04:44] was called the Oilers probably you don't
[1:04:46] even know who they are but if it's a
[1:04:47] Tennessee Titans maybe you would but
[1:04:50] they were up 35 and3 early in the third
[1:04:52] quarter with the Buffalo Bills and they
[1:04:54] didn't even they didn't the bu didn't
[1:04:56] have a first choice quarterback out
[1:04:57] there so it was I mean it was stacked
[1:04:59] towards the Oilers now Titans and the
[1:05:02] Oilers would lose or Titans in overtime
[1:05:05] 35 to 38 and to this day it ranks the
[1:05:07] greatest comeback in NFL
[1:05:10] history no wonder they changed their
[1:05:13] name because Under Pressure they caved
[1:05:18] they had a lead they were they had they
[1:05:20] even had the other team was a secondary
[1:05:21] quarterback but the pressure of it a
[1:05:23] force that was there that they maybe he
[1:05:25] didn't even realize what's causing them
[1:05:27] to adjust how they were responding think
[1:05:31] about it amen and one of the biggest
[1:05:32] areas if I could say pressure maybe as
[1:05:35] we just weave our way through the
[1:05:36] service is we get pressure from our
[1:05:40] peers peer pressure not an easy thing we
[1:05:44] all deal with peer
[1:05:47] pressure whether you want to say so or
[1:05:49] not you think well that's just for the
[1:05:50] teens brother Michael I'm sorry it ain't
[1:05:53] the case it's from zero to 100 not miles
[1:05:57] per hour but in Years everybody is
[1:05:59] affected by peer pressure am man it's in
[1:06:02] everybody's opinion is important and
[1:06:04] everybody has a voice today they got a
[1:06:06] voice on every single you know they want
[1:06:07] to be heard aloud too and every platform
[1:06:10] you wish because you could stack them up
[1:06:12] and put your opinion your voice your
[1:06:14] idea on X Twitter Snapchat WhatsApp
[1:06:17] Facebook Tik Tok YouTube you name it
[1:06:19] Reddit Kora every single one cut copy
[1:06:22] paste all the way through because you
[1:06:23] want your voice your opinion to be heard
[1:06:26] to pressure somebody to your way of
[1:06:29] thinking that's what it is every time
[1:06:31] you click on that little link every time
[1:06:33] you look at some little thread every
[1:06:34] time you pull up some Facebook feed
[1:06:36] someone's given an opinion and you don't
[1:06:38] really realize it but it's pressuring
[1:06:40] you peer pressuring you to their idea
[1:06:44] which is really bringing you back into
[1:06:45] then submitting or surrendering your
[1:06:48] thought to their
[1:06:54] thought pressure
[1:06:58] poor
[1:06:59] job was under pressure from his peers
[1:07:04] and they sat there in their little group
[1:07:07] there I can imagine as job had just had
[1:07:09] his all his Goods all his livelihood all
[1:07:12] his his his livestock and his money his
[1:07:15] whole his whole being had just been
[1:07:16] stripped to the ground his children had
[1:07:18] now been killed and if you read
[1:07:19] scripture which always amazed me every
[1:07:21] time I I mention it it's in the same at
[1:07:23] the same time while he was yet speaking
[1:07:26] this happened while he was yet speaking
[1:07:28] the next thing happened and he was
[1:07:29] stripped to the ground and his peers
[1:07:31] looked at this and said oh my goodness
[1:07:33] something job must be doing something
[1:07:36] very
[1:07:38] wrong and they sat him down and said job
[1:07:41] and they started to strip him down here
[1:07:43] strip him down there and say well you
[1:07:45] must have did some secret sin here maybe
[1:07:47] you didn't do this there and they just
[1:07:49] started to whittle him down and pressure
[1:07:52] him to the point where his wife just
[1:07:54] said just Curse God and die
[1:07:56] job
[1:07:58] pressure think about
[1:08:04] it you know you think sometimes we think
[1:08:06] peer pressure is just bad things you
[1:08:09] know well they're going to press you
[1:08:10] into smoking a cigarette or something
[1:08:12] like that but you don't realize actually
[1:08:14] that there's the devil really is a
[1:08:16] little bit more subtle with you and I
[1:08:19] he's not pressing you to go to the bar
[1:08:20] and drink that's just not how it's going
[1:08:22] to work he knows that's not your area or
[1:08:25] your weak area so to say okay so he the
[1:08:28] devil's a tactician this guy he he's a
[1:08:31] strategist he knows exactly what you do
[1:08:34] he knows exactly where your your weak
[1:08:35] area is he studied you for years however
[1:08:37] old you are he studied you that long and
[1:08:40] he studied Humanity for 6,000 years or
[1:08:42] so and so he knows Humanity in its in in
[1:08:44] its course of action and how we're
[1:08:46] biologically programmed and so he's
[1:08:48] figured out exactly how to work and so
[1:08:50] he watches you and he watches where
[1:08:52] you're at he watches how you move and
[1:08:54] how you respond and how you think and
[1:08:55] he's like I got the exact thing for
[1:09:00] them so here we are in a different we
[1:09:03] live here in a carnal realm or here in
[1:09:05] an Earthly realm but if I could say this
[1:09:07] there's not just peers on an Earthly
[1:09:09] aspect but you also have peer pressure
[1:09:12] From Another Dimension there's pressure
[1:09:14] from an Earthly there's pressure from a
[1:09:17] Heavenly and there's pressure from a
[1:09:19] hell and it's pressing you and I one
[1:09:21] from either side and we're living in the
[1:09:23] middle of it and you wonder why you're
[1:09:25] wasted at the end of the day amen and so
[1:09:28] Satan is there trying to ensure that the
[1:09:31] Realms of Darkness press you to a place
[1:09:33] and impact you I would say Lord I want
[1:09:35] the I want the Realms of light to be
[1:09:38] that force behind me amen I want to be
[1:09:41] that what that peer that's pressing me I
[1:09:43] want the cloud of witnesses to be there
[1:09:45] pressing me saying move on you can do it
[1:09:48] keep pressing on that oh if God could
[1:09:50] open up the banister of glory and you
[1:09:52] could hear them shouting go forward run
[1:09:54] this race get out there live for the
[1:09:59] gospel too often we can just think of
[1:10:01] the devil we can think of the negative
[1:10:03] side and oh he's just pressing me to do
[1:10:05] this or he's pressing me to do this this
[1:10:07] negative thought this negative thought
[1:10:09] but you got a great host you got a great
[1:10:11] host of witnesses that's there behind
[1:10:13] you saying run the
[1:10:17] race that's the peer pressure focus on
[1:10:21] that aspect oh my God help
[1:10:24] us
[1:10:29] pressure Moses was going to give you a
[1:10:32] couple examples of pressure as we work
[1:10:34] our way
[1:10:36] through my title tonight if I can get
[1:10:40] there is in the darkest
[1:10:43] hour we never
[1:10:46] surrender in the darkest hour and Moses
[1:10:50] here as we le as we just work our way
[1:10:53] was under pressure and now the devil
[1:10:55] like I said he's not looking at you to
[1:10:57] go to the bar but maybe he's going to
[1:10:59] work on you some way maybe he's got
[1:11:01] somebody in the church that man they
[1:11:03] just don't they just rub you wrong you
[1:11:06] know they just that person me and them
[1:11:08] maybe we just they say something my just
[1:11:10] kind of gets me going a little
[1:11:13] bit come
[1:11:15] on we're human man we're
[1:11:20] human just in case you you don't think
[1:11:22] you're there Moses is there
[1:11:26] okay and Moses he came the children of
[1:11:29] Israel came to him and even the whole
[1:11:31] you know what I got to take my go
[1:11:35] off now this is three piece suit
[1:11:38] country I told my brothers I said you
[1:11:40] guys better get a threepiece two we're
[1:11:42] going to
[1:11:44] Virginia Ron I'm the only one that
[1:11:46] showed
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:11:53] up oh man I tell you you what this world
[1:11:57] has their people that they admire and
[1:11:58] they put before them and they dress like
[1:12:01] them and they talk like them and they
[1:12:02] make sure they got the same shoes as
[1:12:04] them well guess what we got people in
[1:12:06] The Bride of Jesus Christ that I can
[1:12:08] look toward and say you know what I want
[1:12:09] to dress like them I want to act like
[1:12:11] them they got a walk of God that I want
[1:12:13] to so guess what devil back at
[1:12:19] you don't need to condemn me because oh
[1:12:21] you're just trying to be like so and so
[1:12:23] you bet I'm trying to be like so and so
[1:12:25] because he's got a walk like God that I
[1:12:27] want to
[1:12:31] amonate
[1:12:35] hallelujah amen back to
[1:12:40] Moses then came the children of Israel
[1:12:42] even the whole congregation in the
[1:12:43] desert of Zin in the first month and the
[1:12:45] people Abode in C Kadesh and Miriam died
[1:12:48] there and was buried and then there was
[1:12:50] no water for the congregation and they
[1:12:53] gathered themselves together against
[1:12:55] Moses and against Aaron so the pressure
[1:12:58] now is starting internal they're now
[1:13:01] against Moses here and the people the
[1:13:03] scripture says chowed with Moses chowed
[1:13:07] and so now they're just In Spite and
[1:13:08] they're talking they're speaking they're
[1:13:10] they're being rough here little harsh
[1:13:11] would God that we had died when our
[1:13:14] Brethren died before the Lord can you
[1:13:18] imagine after all they had been through
[1:13:21] would God that we died with our brothers
[1:13:26] on
[1:13:27] pressure and why have ye they're
[1:13:31] pointing their big finger right in the
[1:13:33] nose of Moses not God why have ye
[1:13:38] brought up the congregation of the Lord
[1:13:41] in this Wilderness you did it Moses you
[1:13:43] took us here you brought us to this
[1:13:46] place uh did God take you out of the out
[1:13:49] of Egypt did God bring you through did
[1:13:50] God give you Mana did God do these
[1:13:52] things but no Moses you did it come on
[1:13:56] brought us up the congregation here in
[1:13:58] the wilderness and we and our cattle
[1:13:59] should die here come on
[1:14:03] Moses wherefore have ye made us to come
[1:14:05] out of Egypt to bring us into this evil
[1:14:09] Place wait a second I thought you were
[1:14:12] going to bring us Moses into canaan's
[1:14:15] Fair land the land of milk and
[1:14:18] honey what about your message Moses
[1:14:22] didn't s doesn't look so good now you
[1:14:24] know and so they're attacking him
[1:14:25] they're attacking his message that they'
[1:14:27] pre that he's been speaking to them come
[1:14:28] to the land God's got a place for you a
[1:14:30] land of milk and honey and like No Moses
[1:14:32] your message is
[1:14:35] wrong there's no seed no figs no Vines
[1:14:39] no pomegranates there's no water to
[1:14:41] drink what you told us Moses your
[1:14:44] message of milk and honey is
[1:14:48] false I'm just reading the scripture
[1:14:50] there and just giving you a little bit
[1:14:51] of insight that's what they're saying
[1:14:54] put it into the ground put put it put it
[1:14:55] down in the in the brass tax this wasn't
[1:14:57] just one person this was the whole
[1:15:01] Camp
[1:15:03] pressure
[1:15:06] pressure and they're just grinding at
[1:15:09] Moses and Moses is trying to stand there
[1:15:12] trying to take it and it says Moses then
[1:15:15] went to the presence of the assembly
[1:15:17] under the door of the Tabernacle and
[1:15:18] fell on their faces him and Aaron and
[1:15:20] the Lord spoke to them and he said speak
[1:15:23] ye to The Rock before their eyes and
[1:15:26] it'll give forth water and thou shalt
[1:15:28] bring forth to them water out of the
[1:15:31] Rocks so that thou shalt give the
[1:15:32] congregation and their beasts drink and
[1:15:36] so here Moses I'm just talking pressure
[1:15:39] right now the the how the devil uses
[1:15:42] something to just start to grind trying
[1:15:44] to get you out of your place trying to
[1:15:46] get you to a place where he can get you
[1:15:48] susceptible you got that little area we
[1:15:50] know Moses had maybe had it was a little
[1:15:52] bit of a temper area he had that aspect
[1:15:54] he was he was fiery and so the devil
[1:15:56] knew exactly where to I knew exactly
[1:15:58] where to get you Moses and so he's going
[1:16:00] to work he knows exactly where to get
[1:16:02] you and so he started to put the
[1:16:03] pressure on and he comes out of the
[1:16:05] Tabernacle there the assembly and he
[1:16:07] comes there and the scripture says Moses
[1:16:08] and them gathered there before the Rock
[1:16:11] and he said unto them here now ye
[1:16:17] Rebels you sweet lovely
[1:16:20] people I'm so thrilled that I can just
[1:16:23] Journey with you even though you're
[1:16:25] backbiting me and throwing it in my face
[1:16:27] I love you no no Moses wasn't there
[1:16:31] Moses was ye
[1:16:32] Rebels why must we fetch you water from
[1:16:35] the rock wait a second look at how it
[1:16:38] just tripped him up a little bit why
[1:16:41] must
[1:16:44] we oh Moses just tumbled there and then
[1:16:48] as scripture glorified
[1:16:51] himself because of
[1:16:53] pressure
[1:16:56] pressure and he lifted up his hand and
[1:16:59] smoked the rock twice breaking the types
[1:17:03] of
[1:17:04] scripture Christ was smoked one time not
[1:17:07] two times and there because he gave into
[1:17:10] the
[1:17:11] pressure his temper got him and he
[1:17:14] surrendered to that and it stopped him
[1:17:17] think of the ripple effect because of
[1:17:18] that the ripple effect at that moment
[1:17:21] stopped him from being able to enter
[1:17:23] into the Promised Land
[1:17:25] think about that my goodness there's
[1:17:29] lots of different aspects of
[1:17:31] pressure you can think of Samson in a
[1:17:33] wrong relationship and the pressure that
[1:17:35] Delilah put on him I don't I won't go
[1:17:38] through the scripture but you can
[1:17:39] imagine there he was as as as as Samson
[1:17:42] then desired and gave his heart as
[1:17:44] brother Brown said he gave his strength
[1:17:45] to God and his heart to Delilah and
[1:17:47] there under the pressure of it little by
[1:17:50] little just willing himself down just
[1:17:52] throwing a little bit out there and you
[1:17:53] know well it's it's tie my hands with
[1:17:55] with the these certain uh wi the whips
[1:17:58] or I can't remember it's a funny word in
[1:18:00] the scripture but it then it's ropes and
[1:18:02] then it's weave my hair and he's just
[1:18:04] slowly just being ebbed away and ebbed
[1:18:06] away and the pressure that's being put
[1:18:08] on him and it just vexed his soul
[1:18:11] actually is what scripture said to the
[1:18:12] point where he finally said
[1:18:14] fine if you shave my head think about it
[1:18:18] just slowly but surely it's young people
[1:18:21] that's why you never get into a wrong
[1:18:23] relationship or get yourself into twined
[1:18:25] because the devil is behind there the
[1:18:27] scripture says the Lords of the
[1:18:29] Philistines were behind the Lila don't
[1:18:32] you get into some little relationship
[1:18:33] with somebody that's not serving this
[1:18:35] gospel serving this message because it's
[1:18:37] a Delilah that's got the Lords of the
[1:18:40] Devils of Hell behind them trying to
[1:18:42] find your Covenant and weaken you and
[1:18:44] destabilize you and put you in a mill
[1:18:46] with blind
[1:18:51] eyes the
[1:18:53] Ripple
[1:18:55] devil trying to cause a a caving a
[1:18:58] surrendering you know what the brutal
[1:19:00] thing is is then you get into those
[1:19:02] places and then he knows that you know H
[1:19:05] then he throw you knows I know your weak
[1:19:06] point and then he starts devising these
[1:19:08] different ways this little ripple effect
[1:19:09] of it now you feel like a failure so
[1:19:11] then he works on you see you're a
[1:19:12] failure you did that there and now
[1:19:14] you're a failure how are you even a good
[1:19:15] Christian anymore how do you think
[1:19:16] you're even saved now you're even
[1:19:18] doubting that you're even a even even a
[1:19:20] believer and even saved and that he just
[1:19:21] works on it it's it's a ripple effect
[1:19:23] all the way down that's right because of
[1:19:26] pressure pressure and so he's pushing
[1:19:29] give in influencing you give up your
[1:19:33] morals give up your rights give up the
[1:19:37] promises of the scripture well I'm the
[1:19:39] god that heals all your diseases well
[1:19:42] God hasn't really healed me he hasn't
[1:19:44] really touched me I'm still dealing with
[1:19:46] this certain thing and the devil just
[1:19:48] starts to work on you is he really your
[1:19:51] healer
[1:19:53] pressure
[1:19:55] pressure he says if I brother Brown says
[1:19:57] if I was dying and 5,000 people died a
[1:20:01] 100 years ago and had been in eternity
[1:20:04] that long think of this quote if I was
[1:20:07] dying and 5,000 people died a hundred
[1:20:11] years ago and had been in eternity that
[1:20:14] long rose back and came to Earth and
[1:20:16] said brother brandom don't you trust it
[1:20:20] he's not right don't trust it we trusted
[1:20:22] him we failed I'd still say let me die
[1:20:27] in Jesus
[1:20:28] Christ that to me is a powerful quote he
[1:20:32] was so anchored it didn't matter if
[1:20:34] 5,000 people raised up from the dead and
[1:20:37] say m this is false he said I still
[1:20:40] believe and die in Jesus Christ that's
[1:20:43] where your rock has to be you can't just
[1:20:45] be well my parents do believe it my my
[1:20:47] brother does and my daddy does and this
[1:20:49] that the other because I can tell you in
[1:20:51] that state if 5,000 people raised up and
[1:20:53] said I know it's wrong you're like like
[1:20:54] really all right I'm
[1:20:56] out but when it's something that falls
[1:20:58] deep into your soul God spoke to you you
[1:21:02] know he's a personal God to me it's me
[1:21:04] and Christ and no one else I don't care

[1:21:28] out of History to prove to you and I he

[1:22:19] years ago we didn't talk that way 25
[1:22:21] years ago well that's just what I hear
[1:22:23] at school that's just kind of how it is
[1:22:24] is and now it's all slang and text this
[1:22:26] and LOL and that and the other and then

[1:22:47] age is there to bend you as you slowly
[1:22:51] surrender to its
[1:22:53] way
[1:22:55] that's why this word is
[1:22:56] here to
[1:22:59] resist the enemy in this Dark
[1:23:05] Age the worst time we are in the worst
[1:23:09] time headline breaking news on CNN I bet
[1:23:13] you that would get some serious
[1:23:14] headlines if Fox News breaking news
[1:23:17] everything stopped we are in the darkest
[1:23:19] the worst the most hideous the most
[1:23:21] Blasphemous time this world has ever
[1:23:23] seen
[1:23:26] well then you'd be like tell me
[1:23:27] something I don't
[1:23:31] know for once they'd all be
[1:23:35] correct all of them if they broadcast
[1:23:37] that brother Donnie Reagan then though
[1:23:39] said in a long time ago in a service he
[1:23:42] said that Satan can create enough
[1:23:44] pressure that a Justified man he can
[1:23:47] create enough pressure that will break a
[1:23:50] Justified man he said he can create
[1:23:52] enough pressure that would break a
[1:23:54] Sanctified man just living in
[1:23:56] sanctification but if there's a man
[1:23:59] that's got something he's got a
[1:24:01] lifegiving force that's down in the soul
[1:24:03] of Holy Ghost filled son and daughter of
[1:24:05] God there ain't no pressure there ain't
[1:24:08] no darkness that can press you or move
[1:24:11] you or alter your course nothing will
[1:24:14] move you Hallelujah that's why it
[1:24:17] preached so hard get an experience
[1:24:20] that's why the Holy Ghost experience
[1:24:22] it's preached because you need to get
[1:24:24] there because in just a Justified
[1:24:26] Sanctified life you'll never make
[1:24:35] it that's just straight up
[1:24:41] reality you know there was one man in
[1:24:44] Scripture that
[1:24:46] got just a lot of pressure and I'd like
[1:24:49] to just go through just shortly
[1:24:53] here what time did I start just help me
[1:24:56] out just be
[1:24:58] kind you know if I was sitting back
[1:24:59] there and you asked me I probably would
[1:25:01] tell
[1:25:03] you yeah probably not I take that
[1:25:12] back maybe if I look at my wife out
[1:25:16] there amen if you turn to John you can
[1:25:19] just follow along I'm not necess going
[1:25:21] to read it all but John N has a uh an
[1:25:24] account of a
[1:25:26] man and there he
[1:25:28] was scripture says Jesus passed by I'll
[1:25:31] just read it quickly because I don't
[1:25:33] know what time I started so now I got to
[1:25:34] go really fast so hold on to your seats
[1:25:37] buckle up and his disciples asked him
[1:25:39] saying master who did Sin they said this
[1:25:42] man were his parents that he was born
[1:25:45] blind question he said neither neither
[1:25:49] has sin nor his parents but that the
[1:25:50] works of God should be made manifest and
[1:25:53] I must work The Works of him that sent
[1:25:55] me while it is day the night cometh when
[1:25:59] no man can work as long as I'm in the
[1:26:01] world I am the light of the world and so
[1:26:04] then he had thus spoken and he spits on
[1:26:06] the ground my goodness in this day be
[1:26:09] like whoa that's
[1:26:11] disgusting but there you put it down
[1:26:13] spits makes a little
[1:26:16] clay starts to form it and he's looking
[1:26:19] at that man seeing his eyes all blinded
[1:26:23] and he takes a spit
[1:26:25] the clay and he starts to rub it place
[1:26:27] it in his eyes can you imagine those
[1:26:29] Loving Hands of Christ I just started to
[1:26:32] form that in his eyes just think of that
[1:26:34] moment all would have been quiet there
[1:26:36] as the people looked on he starts rub
[1:26:39] the clay in his
[1:26:41] eye he says no
[1:26:44] goal wash in the pool of
[1:26:47] silon and he went his way
[1:26:50] there you imagine he's got clay in his
[1:26:52] eyes Jesus says
[1:26:57] go yes
[1:26:59] Lord just point me in the
[1:27:02] direction said that way all right I'm
[1:27:05] going amen think about it that's the
[1:27:08] scripture said but there's a man there
[1:27:10] with clay spitt in his eyes and he says
[1:27:12] go Jesus said go to the pool all
[1:27:15] right which way that way I'm going and
[1:27:20] so he makes his way to the pool of silom
[1:27:22] there he gets into the pool and he
[1:27:23] starts to walk can you imagine the
[1:27:25] moment as he starts to scrub that little
[1:27:27] spittle off his eyes he starts to get
[1:27:29] that clay off his eyes and he said wait
[1:27:31] a second light started to pour through
[1:27:32] as he put the Dust Away he said oh my
[1:27:35] goodness I can
[1:27:37] see I can see I tell you the pool of
[1:27:40] silom was a rejoicing place as he was
[1:27:43] jumping and leaping I'm sure I can see I
[1:27:45] haven't seen since the day I was born I
[1:27:47] can now see it he's going through each
[1:27:49] person there saying who did this to you
[1:27:51] well a man back there who was it that
[1:27:53] did this to you and so they take him now
[1:27:56] to the people and he goes back in the
[1:27:58] scripture says he went his way and the
[1:28:00] neighbors therefore they which before
[1:28:03] had seen him that he was blind said is
[1:28:05] this not the one that sat and
[1:28:08] begged and some others said he looks
[1:28:11] like him may maybe I mean he's a little
[1:28:14] bit different now that he sees his
[1:28:15] eyeballs are there and I can see them
[1:28:17] but he said well maybe it's he and he
[1:28:19] said um maybe therefore he they said
[1:28:21] some said this is he he's like him but
[1:28:23] he said I am he come on guys do you need
[1:28:27] your eyes fixed I'm the same one I'm in
[1:28:30] the same clothes I have the same beger
[1:28:32] cup but I can see
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:38] now he said A Man Called Jesus made clay
[1:28:44] and he anointed my eyes he's now telling
[1:28:47] a testimony he said go to the pool of
[1:28:50] Silo and wash and I went and I washed
[1:28:53] and receive my sight
[1:28:57] now they said well where is he I don't
[1:29:01] know where'd he go who is this one and
[1:29:05] you can tell because they brought him to
[1:29:06] the Pharisees it wasn't maybe a good
[1:29:09] interaction well I don't know who is
[1:29:11] this one did he really heal you what's
[1:29:13] his message anyway well I don't know
[1:29:15] about that I mean did he go to the
[1:29:16] synagogue did the do the Pharisees know
[1:29:18] about this one is he approved by the
[1:29:22] church I don't know about that you got
[1:29:24] to come with us to the Pharisees and you
[1:29:26] need to tell them what just happened
[1:29:27] because I don't know if this is really
[1:29:29] right and
[1:29:34] kosher and so they brought him to the
[1:29:36] Pharisees they're putting pressure on
[1:29:38] him who do you think you are testifying
[1:29:41] about this
[1:29:43] man and I think God hasn't sense you
[1:29:45] humor because it was on the Sabbath day
[1:29:48] as scripture says and Jesus had done
[1:29:50] some other healings on the Sabbath day
[1:29:51] and it just rankled the Pharisees
[1:29:54] what is this man doing does he not know
[1:29:58] oh he did he is a Sabbath The Lord of
[1:30:01] the Sabbath God's got a sense of humor
[1:30:04] and so they bring him there to the to
[1:30:06] the Pharisees before him a four time was
[1:30:08] blind and it was Sabbath day and Jesus
[1:30:10] made the clay and opened his eyes and
[1:30:11] then again the Pharisees also asked him
[1:30:14] how he had received his sight now how
[1:30:16] exactly did this happen who is this one
[1:30:18] that calls himself a Healer or they call
[1:30:20] him the Healer well what did he do well
[1:30:22] it's not complicated think about it he's
[1:30:24] just a little begger he's like well guys
[1:30:27] I've just been begging and a man came by
[1:30:30] and he put spittle in the clay and put a
[1:30:32] little dust and and then made clay and
[1:30:33] put it on my eyes and I went and washed
[1:30:35] just as he said I followed his word just
[1:30:37] as he said and I went to the pool just
[1:30:40] as he said and I washed them and my eyes
[1:30:43] and they became they became I could see
[1:30:45] is this so
[1:30:48] complicated is this word
[1:30:51] complicated it says only believe all
[1:30:53] things are possible
[1:30:54] is it complicated his word said it and I
[1:30:57] believed it and I just walked in it and
[1:30:59] he said it and I believe it what's so
[1:31:04] complicated I can tell you a Pharisee
[1:31:07] it's very complicated but to a son and
[1:31:09] daughter of God it ain't
[1:31:12] complicated no
[1:31:15] sir they said
[1:31:18] well this man is not of
[1:31:21] God oh
[1:31:25] all
[1:31:28] right can you
[1:31:30] imagine de
[1:31:32] denying here a blind man has just been
[1:31:35] given
[1:31:36] sight who else can do these
[1:31:39] things he's not of
[1:31:41] God and now this man is sitting there
[1:31:45] under the scrutiny you got to you got to
[1:31:48] remember the Pharisees were pretty
[1:31:51] powerful they controlled a lot of things
[1:31:53] that so the people you just didn't talk
[1:31:55] back to them if I could say it that I
[1:31:57] mean they they they lorded pretty
[1:31:59] heavily and so when you you just weren't
[1:32:01] you had to be pretty careful and so now
[1:32:02] when he's under this he's just a beggar
[1:32:04] and he's like I'm just telling you what
[1:32:06] happened to me they're pressing him he's
[1:32:09] not of God well these these ones are
[1:32:13] their their belief and everything they
[1:32:16] do to serve God is very important to
[1:32:19] them this is part of who they are part
[1:32:21] of who you are and you can imagine what
[1:32:24] you just experienced is not of God well
[1:32:27] if it's not of God who is it
[1:32:29] of so what are they telling him it's not
[1:32:31] of God it's of the devil there's only
[1:32:34] one two two Powers so if they're telling
[1:32:35] him it's not of God and so this man is
[1:32:37] like is under the pressure
[1:32:40] wall he's just he's taking this in he
[1:32:43] said
[1:32:45] therefore he said but because he keepeth
[1:32:47] not the Sabbath day how can a man that
[1:32:50] is a sinner do such Miracles and there
[1:32:52] was division of among them and they
[1:32:54] start to bicker and the banter and this
[1:32:56] and that and the other the beggar's just
[1:32:57] in the middle and he's looking back and
[1:32:58] forth he's say all I know is I could see
[1:33:00] does anybody want to Rejoice with me and
[1:33:02] it's just a hurdle of noise and and loud
[1:33:05] you know loud cacophony of all this and
[1:33:07] they said well they say unto the blind
[1:33:09] man again what's sayest thou of him that
[1:33:11] he opened Thine Eyes he said he is a
[1:33:18] prophet
[1:33:20] okay I'm going to read that again for
[1:33:22] you they say they say unto the blind man
[1:33:24] again what sayest thou of him that he
[1:33:27] that he hath opened Thine Eyes question
[1:33:29] he
[1:33:30] said well from what I've just
[1:33:34] experienced in my short span of
[1:33:37] time he is a
[1:33:41] prophet he had different eyesight he
[1:33:45] might have had natural eyesight just
[1:33:46] rekindled and renewed and brought back
[1:33:48] to him but there was a different a faith
[1:33:50] eyesight an optic that brother red spoke
[1:33:53] of of a prophet optic he could see into
[1:33:55] another realm he was penetrating with
[1:33:57] eyes that penetrated a supernatural
[1:34:00] Dimension and he said that's no normal
[1:34:02] man that's a
[1:34:06] prophet but the Jews did not believe him
[1:34:09] that he had been blind and received his
[1:34:11] sight until they called the the the
[1:34:14] parents can you
[1:34:16] imagine they that he had been blind and
[1:34:19] they did not believe him concerning him
[1:34:21] that he had been blind so I you know
[1:34:23] what I just don't believe you you you
[1:34:26] you must have seen before you're a fake
[1:34:29] he's like I've been here for like
[1:34:31] decades begging you Rabbi so and so gave
[1:34:35] me shekels you Rabbi so and so gave me
[1:34:38] shekels how have you not how are you
[1:34:40] just you know misrepresenting my my H
[1:34:43] facial aspects how are you not
[1:34:45] recognizing who I am and he must have
[1:34:47] been an utter
[1:34:49] disbelief go get your
[1:34:52] parents
[1:34:54] and they asked them is this your
[1:34:58] son who you say was born blind and now
[1:35:02] sees and his parents said we know that
[1:35:05] this is our son and that he was born
[1:35:06] blind but by what means he now seeth we
[1:35:10] know not or who hath opened his eyes we
[1:35:13] know not he's of age ask him I don't
[1:35:16] know he was down there at a church one
[1:35:18] day and he met so he was sitting in a
[1:35:21] service and he was hearing the word
[1:35:23] spoke it is my son but then he came home
[1:35:26] one day and said Daddy I was saved
[1:35:30] tonight I don't know about it I know
[1:35:32] nothing about it in fact it's not what I

[1:35:58] was with who he was with I know not but
[1:36:00] just ask him but we want nothing to do
[1:36:02] with
[1:36:04] it can you
[1:36:06] imagine he was blind and he now
[1:36:10] sees wouldn't you think the change would
[1:36:13] be welcomed I don't care who did it I
[1:36:16] don't know what was done can I find him
[1:36:19] search the City who just healed my son
[1:36:23] where is Pharisees I don't even care

[1:36:27] him isn't that what it is oh was just at
[1:36:29] a service I gave my heart to the Lord I
[1:36:31] received this message there's a Prophet

[1:36:55] your filthy magazines go back to your
[1:36:57] filthy websites we want you how you were
[1:37:00] before and they pressed
[1:37:04] him I'm just talking
[1:37:12] pressure and therefore he asked his
[1:37:14] parents he's of age ask him and he
[1:37:17] answered and said I'm just going
[1:37:20] quickly they again called the man that
[1:37:22] was blind and he said unto him give God
[1:37:23] God praise we know that this man is a
[1:37:25] sinner he like I have been doing
[1:37:28] that have you not been hearing me I've
[1:37:30] been praising him all day long for what
[1:37:33] he's done for me and then they said to
[1:37:36] him what did he to thee how did he open
[1:37:39] your eyes and he answered them I told
[1:37:42] you already like 80 times wherefore
[1:37:46] would you hear it again and will you
[1:37:48] also be his
[1:37:52] disciple
[1:37:54] love
[1:37:55] scripture I've told you you need to meet
[1:37:59] him too cuz you're dead you're just an
[1:38:02] actor in your tradition and all your
[1:38:04] laws and this and that and the other you
[1:38:06] need to meet a living God that can open
[1:38:08] the eyes of the Blind and heal the lame
[1:38:10] and raise the sick and deliver the
[1:38:13] [Applause]
[1:38:13] [Laughter]
[1:38:15] halt you preaching to me
[1:38:20] boy and they reviled him
[1:38:24] scripture says then they sent him out
[1:38:27] and pressed him so and they sent him out
[1:38:30] and they sent him out of the synagogue
[1:38:33] and they cast him
[1:38:37] out
[1:38:39] pressure but that man I could tell you
[1:38:42] walked
[1:38:43] away no caring about nothing I can tell
[1:38:47] you right now whatever you got in there
[1:38:50] is dead and I'm going to find him I'm
[1:38:53] going to find him who was it that just
[1:38:55] opened my eyes I got to search the city
[1:38:58] for him and Jesus
[1:39:01] heard oh yes he did he knew exactly what
[1:39:04] was going on all the time and Jesus
[1:39:07] heard that they had cast him out and
[1:39:09] when he found
[1:39:11] him amen Jesus was going to look for him
[1:39:14] and when he found him he said Dost thou
[1:39:17] believe on the Son of God and he
[1:39:20] answered Lord who is he that I might
[1:39:24] believe on him that's the heart of a son
[1:39:27] and daughter of God lord where is he I
[1:39:30] need whatever wherever he is and there
[1:39:32] Jesus said in him thou Hast both seen
[1:39:34] him and it is he that talketh to thee oh
[1:39:39] it's just like the woman at the well I
[1:39:41] that speaketh to thee am he one of my
[1:39:44] favorite scriptures happening again
[1:39:46] right there with a blind man who had
[1:39:47] just went through the heat the hottest
[1:39:49] and heaviest pressure to conform this is
[1:39:52] not the mess said this is false this is
[1:39:54] wrong what you what you saw was was fake
[1:39:57] and it's not true you need to get out of
[1:39:59] it it's a cult go here and go there he
[1:40:01] said no I don't believe it something in
[1:40:04] my soul is telling me this is true I
[1:40:07] have to find him I have to go search for
[1:40:09] him and God because he's predestinated
[1:40:12] knew exactly what he was looking for and
[1:40:15] when and found him he said
[1:40:17] I I am he hallelujah
[1:40:22] hallelujah and you know what he
[1:40:25] did and he worshiped him oh my goodness
[1:40:30] that was a seat of God and the Great
[1:40:33] Mighty Hunter was looking for his
[1:40:35] children the eagle screamed and there he
[1:40:37] was snatched him out of the hands of a
[1:40:40] dead
[1:40:41] religion he took the
[1:40:46] pressure because inside of him was
[1:40:49] something that could
[1:40:52] hold
[1:40:54] man the devil intimidate you can you
[1:40:55] imagine going through all of that and
[1:40:57] you wear skirts and you do this and you
[1:40:59] do that and you live funny and you this
[1:41:00] girls you dress funny and all that and
[1:41:02] he tries to make you feel some sort of
[1:41:05] second class you ain't no second class
[1:41:07] you're first
[1:41:11] class there's nothing anybody in this
[1:41:13] gospel needs to be intimidated and worry
[1:41:15] about you walk through your school
[1:41:16] hallways you walk through your work
[1:41:18] hallways you say I'm a Son of God I
[1:41:20] ain't no ashamed of nothing
[1:41:23] [Applause]
[1:41:29] amen you know there was Peter one
[1:41:35] day and Jesus said to him just a couple
[1:41:37] chapters
[1:41:44] here Jesus said eat my flesh and drink
[1:41:47] my
[1:41:47] blood so he starts to preach the
[1:41:50] word and everybody there is silent
[1:41:54] okay this is
[1:41:56] different then he said does it offend
[1:41:58] you what if you see shall see the son of
[1:42:01] man Ascend up to where he was before and
[1:42:04] Jesus is speaking it is the spirit that
[1:42:07] quickeneth the flesh profited nothing
[1:42:08] the words that I speak un you they are
[1:42:09] spirit and they are
[1:42:11] life and they're the disciples all
[1:42:13] everybody all the disciples hundreds of
[1:42:16] them are all around
[1:42:17] listening and scripture says from that
[1:42:21] time many of his disciples went back and
[1:42:25] walked no more and then Jesus turned to
[1:42:27] the 12 and said will ye also go
[1:42:32] away and I can just see Peter God Point
[1:42:35] his finger right in his face will you
[1:42:37] also go away he just heard a lot of
[1:42:40] things he's like I don't even understand
[1:42:42] I can just see as Peter in that moment I
[1:42:44] can just see his whole world come to a
[1:42:46] standstill everything just freeze and
[1:42:49] he's seeing there Jesus with his finger
[1:42:50] pointed at him will you also go away and
[1:42:53] Peter Ste
[1:42:55] out what do I do now I've never heard
[1:42:58] words like this before eat his flesh
[1:43:01] drink his
[1:43:02] blood I can't even comprehend that and
[1:43:05] he's looking at this he's seeing now all
[1:43:06] those have turned his back they just
[1:43:08] turned their back they've walked away
[1:43:11] and there Peter standing with a finger
[1:43:12] in his face you too but everything I've
[1:43:15] seen I've seen in this word everything
[1:43:17] I've seen in this message not one time
[1:43:19] did he call out a need and it was never
[1:43:21] it was forever true he called he he
[1:43:23] dealt with the lame he dealt with the
[1:43:24] halt he dealt with the blind he dealt
[1:43:25] with the dumb and they all received
[1:43:27] their sight they received their hearing
[1:43:28] he would call out that woman at the well
[1:43:30] and he called all the names of all her H
[1:43:32] all of her husbands and told her that
[1:43:33] she had had many husbands how can I
[1:43:34] comprehend all this how can I put it
[1:43:36] together and he's just wrestling that
[1:43:37] with in his mind he's saying who could
[1:43:39] this
[1:43:45] be Peter back in the finger goes
[1:43:51] away and he said
[1:43:54] Lord to whom shall we
[1:43:59] go something dropped
[1:44:01] there thou alone Hast the words of
[1:44:05] eternal life something sparked inside
[1:44:09] him I don't understand it all I don't
[1:44:11] know exactly everything he's saying but
[1:44:13] all I know is he's the truth the way and
[1:44:17] the life and I'm going to put my face
[1:44:19] sit towards wherever he goes I'm going
[1:44:21] to go Ruth did it she followed her Naomi
[1:44:24] where you go I go where you die I die
[1:44:27] will your God be my God I'm going to
[1:44:28] pull from that scripture and Peter says
[1:44:30] where you go I'm going to go where can I
[1:44:33] go but where you lead
[1:44:37] me we
[1:44:39] believe and are sure a lot was going on
[1:44:43] right there and from Heaven I
[1:44:45] Thunderbolt of
[1:44:47] Revelation and he could say are sure
[1:44:50] that thou art the son of the Living God
[1:44:53] God oh I love
[1:45:00] scripture but brandom
[1:45:04] said he said well how do I know I was
[1:45:07] just pondering about God you can hear
[1:45:09] about that since he called my name on
[1:45:11] the book of redemption you many of you
[1:45:12] young ones have heard we've sang songs
[1:45:14] you've read scripture your name's
[1:45:16] written on the
[1:45:18] book say
[1:45:20] well is it like they're wrote on the
[1:45:22] name on on the book I'm going to tell
[1:45:25] you but AB Braham says your name was
[1:45:28] placed in the word and when the word is
[1:45:33] revealed that is what beckons and calls
[1:45:36] you so your name is in the book because
[1:45:39] you respond to the word of the hour of
[1:45:42] your day and when it went forth
[1:45:45] something inside like Peter said wait a
[1:45:47] second that's quickening something
[1:45:48] inside me I've been sitting at some dead
[1:45:50] denomination but I just heard something
[1:45:53] that's your name on the book he said
[1:45:56] only those that can respond to the word
[1:45:58] the word had to be opened or those that
[1:46:00] were able to respond would have nothing
[1:46:02] to be called with so the word in this
[1:46:04] day was open so that you could be called
[1:46:07] by a word that could reach down to your
[1:46:09] soul the word identified who you
[1:46:13] are he said the loosing and the
[1:46:18] claiming he said what was she he was
[1:46:21] speaking about the little Pro itute she
[1:46:23] was the one that had her name there no
[1:46:25] matter what kind of state she was in as
[1:46:27] soon as that true Gospel Light struck
[1:46:30] the little prostitute she recognized it
[1:46:33] that's how you know you're called
[1:46:35] because when the word Goes Forth and you
[1:46:37] started to read that book wow serpent
[1:46:38] seed I never even read this before you
[1:46:40] mean godhead you mean it's not a trinity
[1:46:42] and something starts to spark off in
[1:46:43] your soul I tell you that's how you're
[1:46:46] called by the word of this
[1:46:48] hour Peter was here in his name can you
[1:46:52] imagine to see roll call and suddenly
[1:46:56] Peter the
[1:46:58] eternities we're sure that thou are the
[1:47:03] Christ
[1:47:05] amen that's what was happening that's
[1:47:07] why the woman of the well could never
[1:47:08] surrender that's why Paul could never
[1:47:10] surrender after that that's why Peter
[1:47:12] could be crucified upside down because
[1:47:15] he became sure something had anchored at
[1:47:18] his heart in the darkest hour can you
[1:47:20] imagine getting yourself prepared on a
[1:47:22] cross and Nails starting to go on your
[1:47:24] hands and now he starting to get flipped
[1:47:25] upside down and put up on the cross The
[1:47:28] Darkest
[1:47:31] Hour Peter wasn't saying I'm done can't
[1:47:35] do it take me down I recant it
[1:47:38] all oh no he said I'm not even worthy to
[1:47:41] die like my Lord turn me upside
[1:47:47] down what is it then but brah says the
[1:47:50] rock it's built on it's divine re
[1:47:52] revelation of who Jesus Christ is upon
[1:47:55] the solid rock Christ builds his church
[1:47:57] all the gates of hell will never Prevail
[1:47:59] when that direct Revelation comes from
[1:48:01] Heaven that Christ is your emancipator
[1:48:04] and when he has become your savior your
[1:48:06] deliverer and that is anchored in your
[1:48:07] heart all the devils in in torment will
[1:48:11] never make you deny it come on do you
[1:48:15] know how many Devils there are it didn't
[1:48:17] say some it didn't say a 100 it didn't
[1:48:20] say 200,000 it said all
[1:48:23] every aspect of Hell could be put down
[1:48:26] and suddenly on one big ball of demons
[1:48:29] pressing against you can you imagine the
[1:48:33] pressure but it wouldn't matter if every
[1:48:37] demon power starts to push down on every
[1:48:41] area of your life you just stand there I
[1:48:44] can take it not me but the life inside
[1:48:47] me and he starts to send you like job
[1:48:50] starts to strip you down starts to take
[1:48:52] your possession start to take your
[1:48:53] health and you're like oh God I don't
[1:48:55] know how I can endure this but by your
[1:48:57] strength I can get
[1:49:02] through I'm so thankful that my God
[1:49:06] never
[1:49:08] surrendered think about the victory
[1:49:10] there in the regions of
[1:49:12] hell even in the darkest of darkest of
[1:49:16] regions there was the scene of all
[1:49:18] scenes one of my favorite scenes that
[1:49:21] brother Brenham speaks about when Satan
[1:49:24] for the first time is hearing this news
[1:49:27] I love this because Christ had just
[1:49:31] endured The Darkest Hour he had just
[1:49:34] finished being on his knees in
[1:49:36] Gethsemane and like drops of blood
[1:49:38] dropping from his his brow as he his
[1:49:42] will is being stripped from him you
[1:49:44] think you've had a tough time trying to
[1:49:45] find the will of God and maybe knowing
[1:49:47] that God's leading you in a certain
[1:49:48] direction and you sit there and you're
[1:49:50] like oh God I don't know I can't do this
[1:49:53] he sat there and he knew exactly what
[1:49:55] was before
[1:49:57] him he knew the cross was there he knew
[1:50:00] the whips were there he knew the beating
[1:50:02] he knew the thorn crowd of thorns and
[1:50:04] the pain that he was going to endure he
[1:50:07] oh God not th will and the pressure you
[1:50:11] think the devil wasn't there
[1:50:12] capitalizing on that moment where he
[1:50:13] could just press in the doubt and press
[1:50:15] in all this yeah you don't have to go
[1:50:17] through this he already tried a little
[1:50:18] while ago and said hey I'll just give
[1:50:19] you it all you know you don't have to do
[1:50:21] all that just I'll take Give It All the
[1:50:22] kingdoms just bow to me you don't have
[1:50:24] to go through all of this pressure he
[1:50:28] said no I have my loving bride that's
[1:50:31] who's on my mind and so there he went he
[1:50:33] wrestled it out the rud and offspring of
[1:50:35] David think if think if David didn't go
[1:50:37] to Goliath and there he was getting his
[1:50:38] little sling out and he looks at the GL
[1:50:39] says who ho no way I'm
[1:50:43] out there'd be no Kingdom of David
[1:50:46] there'd been no Solomon there had been
[1:50:47] no roote and offspring of David the
[1:50:49] whole ripple effect of that no no no God
[1:50:51] placed exactly what what was needed in
[1:50:53] this heart and soul because David could
[1:50:55] come to them that Glide there was no
[1:50:57] fear there was nothing ain't
[1:50:58] surrendering to you and neither was God
[1:51:00] going to sit there and surrender to the
[1:51:02] Ws of the enemy and so there he was
[1:51:04] there in in the day in the time as as
[1:51:06] life now started to to be to to be taken
[1:51:08] away from
[1:51:11] him and he hung on the cross and died
[1:51:13] the cruel death as he dared the pain and
[1:51:16] the agony of the of the nails in his
[1:51:18] hands as the Roman solders smash the
[1:51:20] nail down to his hand
[1:51:26] but he never
[1:51:27] surrendered because he then started to
[1:51:29] walk down into the regions of hell this
[1:51:34] was a moment I wish I hope God plays it
[1:51:37] back for us when we get across eternity
[1:51:40] and he starts to come in there and
[1:51:41] brother Brenham says you knock on the
[1:51:45] door who is
[1:51:48] it open the
[1:51:50] door but Bram says open the doors and
[1:51:52] there mingling Souls there in prison
[1:51:54] waiting for the day of
[1:51:58] judgment open the
[1:52:00] door I'm the Son of God the Virgin
[1:52:05] born he says there I'm he I can just see

[1:52:30] him he thought he was the one he thought
[1:52:33] he was a Son of God yeah that's what I'm
[1:52:35] here to talk to you about B there's
[1:52:36] somebody you need to say I'm busy who is
[1:52:38] it well he says he's the Virgin born
[1:52:41] said what excuse me bring him in
[1:52:46] here
[1:52:48] amen and Christ strides into that little
[1:52:50] room H probably wasn't a little room the
[1:52:53] headquarters of
[1:52:54] hell can you imagine your God down in
[1:52:58] the headquarters of
[1:53:01] hell he said I am he I am the one and
[1:53:06] everything was written of me in my
[1:53:08] father's word and I have confirmed it on
[1:53:11] in Yonder on the cross it's finished
[1:53:14] close the doors that's all of it they
[1:53:17] have to
[1:53:19] recognize the Earth knew him he said it
[1:53:22] shook the great earthquake when he died
[1:53:23] the moon hit its face the very Creator
[1:53:25] was dying oh brother BR says I feel
[1:53:27] religious tonight he says I know what
[1:53:29] I'm talking about I'm not lost in the
[1:53:30] fog I know right where I'm standing he
[1:53:32] descended right there in the lower
[1:53:34] regions of hell he said who are you and
[1:53:36] Satan opens it up he said you finally
[1:53:37] arrived did you I've been waiting for
[1:53:39] you I thought I had you and he goes
[1:53:42] through all the different ones that have
[1:53:43] gone before and he's like yeah you're
[1:53:44] just like another one you just died my
[1:53:46] champion of death has just taken you
[1:53:49] out
[1:53:51] okay say Satan I I don't even know how I
[1:53:54] could conjure up the words as he would
[1:53:56] have bellowed out those words with a
[1:53:58] voice of authority actually probably
[1:53:59] would have said
[1:54:00] Satan give me the
[1:54:04] keys just give me the keys I don't even
[1:54:07] need to fight you about it cuz you're
[1:54:09] done you're finished just hand them over
[1:54:13] surrender surrender devil it's your
[1:54:19] time
[1:54:21] yeah
[1:54:23] he said you don't possess them anymore
[1:54:24] he said 'oh yes I do he says because
[1:54:27] back Yonder in the Garden of Eden where
[1:54:29] Adam sinned and because he sinned he
[1:54:31] trespassed and I got him he's dead He's
[1:54:33] Mine He's into hell oh wait devil wait
[1:54:36] wait wait did you just miss something
[1:54:38] I'm pretty sure you blinked and when you
[1:54:39] blinked you didn't miss that I was
[1:54:41] hanging on a cross and I am virgin born
[1:54:44] my blood was created I am Immanuel I am
[1:54:47] the king of kings I am the mighty
[1:54:49] conqueror it's not another man up there
[1:54:51] I am your
[1:54:56] creator think of that one I'm your
[1:54:59] creator Devil Hand him
[1:55:05] over glory to God my God didn't
[1:55:09] surrender why because he
[1:55:11] couldn't and neither can
[1:55:14] [Applause]
[1:55:18] you Hallelujah the devil didn't want to
[1:55:21] give him the keys he's trying to hold on
[1:55:23] to them well he's trying to find some
[1:55:24] excuse you got no excuse there's no
[1:55:26] backend thing and some written unwritten
[1:55:28] law and so God just had to go there and
[1:55:30] say well fine then I'll just take them
[1:55:31] from you that's right and so he pulled
[1:55:33] them off his bed Loops as brother
[1:55:35] brandham said and you know what he said
[1:55:36] he smacked him in the
[1:55:38] [Music]

[1:55:43] one of their kids maybe not smack him in
[1:55:44] the face but give a SWAT you listen to
[1:55:46] me the first time when I tell you to
[1:55:48] give me my keys you give me my keys
[1:55:51] smack
[1:55:55] amen and then he walked out of there and
[1:55:58] he shut the door so hard brother
[1:56:00] brandham said the suit pegs of Hell blew
[1:56:03] dust in his
[1:56:04] eyes what just happened to me you just
[1:56:07] were stripped of all your power death
[1:56:10] and hell is no longer in your hands
[1:56:18] hallelujah hallelujah because of that
[1:56:21] very act right there it's time to turn

[1:56:35] properties you say well what about me
[1:56:37] brother Michael yeah well Jesus was in

[1:56:42] just like you and I and he went through
[1:56:44] all the things that you and I went
[1:56:45] through and he bore these trials that we
[1:56:47] he we go through brother BR it's
[1:56:49] scripture says he went through and
[1:56:50] suffered it all so that he would know
[1:56:52] what it was like and he was pressured at
[1:56:55] different times of surrender to put him
[1:56:57] in positions to give in but he never
[1:57:00] did because he was showing you and I
[1:57:03] that with my life inside of you I have
[1:57:07] just proven that Earthly flesh filled
[1:57:10] with God can overcome everything even
[1:57:21] death and
[1:57:23] now please tell me what time I
[1:57:26] started you need
[1:57:29] to 10 10 minutes and I'll find where I'm

[1:58:11] today no no no God didn't raise you up
[1:58:12] to do that he raised you up to get out
[1:58:14] of bed I think it was brother Donnie
[1:58:16] that said a long time ago he wanted Dead
[1:58:18] the devil to be shuttering in his boots
[1:58:19] the moment he got out of bed I think
[1:58:21] that butter Donnie said said that back
[1:58:23] back years ago and I'd say oh God may I
[1:58:24] have the same testimony amen that if
[1:58:26] when I got out of bed the devil's
[1:58:28] wondering oh dear goodness what am I

[1:59:02] no no he was going to come down there to
[1:59:03] prove over and over and over and over

[1:59:07] could walk and blind could see he went
[1:59:09] through there just smashing through
[1:59:11] Satan's kingdom because he was going to
[1:59:13] then send his life to you and I so that
[1:59:15] we could be the same Wrecking

[2:00:10] today
[2:00:14] Hallelujah I'm going to quit somewhere
[2:00:16] because I have to yes I do my goodness
[2:00:21] and I thought was short on notes my
[2:00:22] wife's going to laugh at
[2:00:24] me you know I was looking for a little
[2:00:27] uh looking for a paper I was actually
[2:00:29] the Library of
[2:00:31] Congress in DC and I was looking for I
[2:00:33] wanted to find a letter and I couldn't
[2:00:35] find it I forgot and then I was madly
[2:00:37] trying to find it my uh reminder didn't
[2:00:40] come in time and so what happened I
[2:00:44] wanted to bring to you today was
[2:00:46] actually a letter that a German
[2:00:48] Commander brought to the US Army in
[2:00:52] Germany during the World War and the
[2:00:56] German this was a dark
[2:00:59] hour this is the Battle of Baston the
[2:01:03] area there if those of you would know
[2:01:04] the war would know that they were
[2:01:06] surrounded they were getting pulverized
[2:01:08] by artillery and it was basically
[2:01:10] looking like it was for
[2:01:12] dead and the Germans sent a letter and
[2:01:14] they said I will quote the fortune of
[2:01:17] war is
[2:01:19] changing this time the USA forces in and
[2:01:21] nearb stall have um this is very blurry
[2:01:25] sorry have been ined by strong German
[2:01:27] armored units more German armored units
[2:01:30] have crossed the river U uh near uville
[2:01:34] sorry Jess have taken Marsh and reached
[2:01:37] St hu by passing through hbre T all
[2:01:41] these different places there in France
[2:01:43] and there is only one possibility to
[2:01:45] save the encircled USA troops from Total
[2:01:48] Annihilation that is The Honorable
[2:01:50] surrender of the encircled town in order
[2:01:53] to think it over a term of two hours
[2:01:54] will be granted beginning with the
[2:01:56] presentation of this note if this
[2:01:58] proposal proposal should be rejected by
[2:01:59] one German uh rejected one German
[2:02:01] artillery Corps and six heavy AA
[2:02:03] battalions are ready to annihilate the
[2:02:05] USA in and near Baston the order for
[2:02:08] firing will be given immediately after
[2:02:10] this two hours term all the serious
[2:02:13] civilian losses caused by this artillery
[2:02:15] fire would not correspond with the
[2:02:17] well-known American
[2:02:19] Humanity the German Commander
[2:02:23] and that was presented to some troops
[2:02:25] and then it went through the
[2:02:27] whole chain of command to try and find
[2:02:31] the person that could respond adequately
[2:02:35] because this is a
[2:02:36] formal uh letter of
[2:02:39] surrender and rightly so it was dark it
[2:02:42] was dismal and it surely looked like it
[2:02:45] was the end of that of that of the
[2:02:47] troops there and it went its way to a
[2:02:50] brigadier general uh um that was was
[2:02:53] there and moli and he finally got to him
[2:02:56] and they the report to say and this is
[2:02:58] verified and he he comes out and they
[2:03:00] they say his very first words when they
[2:03:02] said he he asked what was the letter and
[2:03:04] he said the Germans are asking for your
[2:03:05] surrender he said oh
[2:03:08] nutsen like they're crazy that was his
[2:03:11] very first response I thought my
[2:03:14] goodness here he's being pulverized the
[2:03:17] artillery of Baston was just obliterated
[2:03:20] and he knew exactly his troops was was
[2:03:23] but deep inside of that General he said
[2:03:25] this crazy me surrender are you
[2:03:29] nuts and so then it went through all the
[2:03:31] different again and trying to find you
[2:03:32] know this there's a lot of places to go
[2:03:34] I guess on the front lines to get it
[2:03:36] through and they finally had to catch
[2:03:37] Scrat say well well this is formal you
[2:03:39] know a formal letter what are we going
[2:03:41] to say formally back to them and he's
[2:03:42] like well I I don't know you know there
[2:03:44] was some some some conversation and one
[2:03:46] of the AIDS said well your first
[2:03:48] response was pretty
[2:03:50] good and they're like he's like okay and
[2:03:55] the official letter that went back to
[2:03:56] the Germans was typed centered December
[2:04:00] 22nd 1944 to the German Commander comma
[2:04:05] enter Nots exclamation mark enter enter
[2:04:09] the American
[2:04:14] Commander yeah I thought that's exactly
[2:04:18] right devil you can be down on us so
[2:04:20] hard thinking you youve encircled us
[2:04:22] with your demon troops and you're saying
[2:04:24] he's telling you listen buddy you ain't
[2:04:26] going to make it out of here you don't
[2:04:28] think you can do this I got all that
[2:04:30] hell on you boy and you ain't going to
[2:04:32] make
[2:04:32] it and you know what a child of God says
[2:04:36] you're nuts devil you're crazy because
[2:04:39] inside of me is the same God that
[2:04:42] defeated you at Calvary and so guess
[2:04:44] where this body's going it's going out
[2:04:46] of
[2:04:48] here

[2:06:58] described premise there is now due
[2:07:00] unpaid and delinquent rent in the total

[2:07:05] of
[2:07:06] God it's time to pay up

[2:07:57] tonight and I ain't surrendering what
[2:07:59] God has given
[2:08:01] me well
[2:08:11] sir you
[2:08:15] know this was the enlarged
[2:08:19] version the version the virgin that the
[2:08:22] version that the devil heard was it
[2:08:27] is
[2:08:32] finished I just gave you a little extra
[2:08:35] but that's what he heard so we had to
[2:08:37] enlarge a little bit and translate that
[2:08:39] to down to Hell's headquarters so they
[2:08:40] knew exactly what that meant just in
[2:08:41] case they were confused by that line so
[2:08:44] I'd say this evening as we close and
[2:08:46] musicians can come let Faith raise up
[2:08:47] and let the unction of God go forth from
[2:08:49] your lips evict the devil Never Never
[2:08:52] Surrender never give in never give up
[2:08:55] amen because what's inside of you
[2:08:57] brother BR says When Faith When Faith
[2:08:59] looks at God's worst it esteems it
[2:09:02] Greater and more valuable than the best
[2:09:04] the world can
[2:09:06] show that's a powerful quote When Faith
[2:09:09] looks at God's worst he was talking
[2:09:11] about Moses as as he looked at the mud
[2:09:13] and all of that difference and he looked
[2:09:15] at that and esteemed it greater than the
[2:09:17] values and the riches of Egypt no matter
[2:09:19] what you have what you're in how
[2:09:21] difficult it is look at that and let
[2:09:23] Faith look at the word of God and say I
[2:09:24] don't know whatever is happening
[2:09:26] whatever my circumstance but I'm looking
[2:09:27] to the word of God no matter what else
[2:09:30] the devil shows me I say tonight I say
[2:09:33] for Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle
[2:09:35] here all hell has assailed you and will
[2:09:39] continue to assail you but a lighthouse
[2:09:43] is built on a
[2:09:45] Rock Amen a lighthouse is built on a
[2:09:47] rock and I've seen the pictures of a big
[2:09:50] old Lighthouse and waves come crashing
[2:09:52] down on it and it exposes as the waves
[2:09:56] go around the lighthouse it exposes what
[2:09:58] the foundation
[2:10:02] is amen when all's calm you just look at
[2:10:05] the Lighthouse and it's standing there
[2:10:06] so nicely like well what is the build on
[2:10:07] I don't know it just looks so beautiful
[2:10:09] but then the waves start to
[2:10:11] crash and it just filters all around
[2:10:13] there and for that moment of a snapshot
[2:10:15] you see this curl of a wave and then you
[2:10:17] can see right down to the very base and
[2:10:19] it's all solid concrete feet upon feet
[2:10:22] upon feet the foundation is so firm and
[2:10:25] I tell you that's why H tells you don't
[2:10:28] don't don't get dismayed don't surrender
[2:10:30] it's proving to the world it's proving
[2:10:32] to the devil that your foundation is the
[2:10:35] rock of Revelation on who you
[2:10:41] believe I say it's in you it's in you to
[2:10:45] have Victory it's because Christ in
[2:10:48] because of him we have the victory
[2:10:49] because it's our that's where our life
[2:10:50] for comes from I tell you right now the
[2:10:53] devil did not have pressure just by
[2:10:55] reading the
[2:10:58] words just reading
[2:11:01] words and
[2:11:03] Moses then prophesied there was a
[2:11:05] deliverer would come come from Abraham
[2:11:08] or sorry Abraham had prophesied that
[2:11:10] Moses there'd be a deliverer coming
[2:11:12] after such and such amount of years you
[2:11:14] know that could have written down and
[2:11:16] the devil look at that oh interesting
[2:11:18] but the moment that became flesh
[2:11:21] now the devil had a
[2:11:24] problem and so the prophecies in
[2:11:26] scripture the devil can look at those
[2:11:28] and be like well that's nice scripture
[2:11:30] that's that's very nice but suddenly
[2:11:32] when Isaiah became flesh a virgin shall
[2:11:35] conceive oh now the devil had pressure
[2:11:39] now he was being putting backed up
[2:11:41] against the W wait a second oh dear
[2:11:43] goodness I didn't really see it that way
[2:11:45] I didn't know that scripture was going
[2:11:47] to cause me so much grief look what's
[2:11:48] been going on through Judea and through
[2:11:50] Galilee what is going on and the same
[2:11:53] thing is happening today in this lean
[2:11:55] age when God has prophesied and sent a
[2:11:58] message to say there'll be a blameless
[2:11:59] there'll be a faultless virgin bride in
[2:12:01] Jesus Christ it's been prophesied that
[2:12:03] you'll be here and there ain't nothing
[2:12:06] put the pressure on the
[2:12:10] devil I say May the brothers and sisters
[2:12:14] here in Elton Virginia create havoc on
[2:12:17] the kingdom of hell and darkness it
[2:12:19] ain't going to press on it might try to
[2:12:21] press on you but I can tell you I know
[2:12:23] the image of Samson maybe is a little
[2:12:25] different in her eyes but maybe just as
[2:12:27] just for image sake the devil's going to
[2:12:29] press down and you it's going
[2:12:35] press I'm just bench pressing the
[2:12:38] pressure because what's in you is
[2:12:40] stronger than any force of hell that
[2:12:43] will come on down at
[2:12:45] you and in this darkest
[2:12:49] Tower there's a
[2:12:52] promise the morning
[2:12:56] cometh amen arise and shine for your
[2:13:00] light has come
