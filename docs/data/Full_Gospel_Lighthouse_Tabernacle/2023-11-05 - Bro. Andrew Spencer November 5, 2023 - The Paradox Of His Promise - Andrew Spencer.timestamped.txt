[45:00] gathered in my name there I will be in
[45:02] the midst of them and father we
[45:05] recognize Lord that that we're not here
[45:08] gathered on our own accord but we

[51:30] chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 and
[51:33] verse 2 and also down to uh Mark 11 and
[51:44] 22 ain't it good to be a
[51:51] Christian that's my
[51:54] song
[51:56] Hallelujah I'm glad he made me a new man
[51:59] in Christ Jesus amen second Peter
[52:02] chapter 1 and verse
[52:08] two amen the Bible says here that Grace
[52:12] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[52:15] the knowledge of God and of our and of
[52:19] Jesus our lord according as his divine
[52:22] power ha given unto us all things that
[52:25] pertain un life and godliness through
[52:27] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[52:31] to glory and
[52:32] virtue whereby are giving unto us
[52:36] exceeding great and precious
[52:39] promises whereby are given unto us
[52:43] exceeding great and precious promises
[52:47] that by these you might be partakers of
[52:49] the divine nature having escaped the
[52:52] corruption that is in the world through
[52:55] lust also Mark 11: 22 this
[53:01] morning very very familiar scripture to
[53:04] us as message Believers and studiers of
[53:07] the word we realize that this is the
[53:09] scripture that the Brandon was sitting
[53:12] there and he was studying that day when
[53:13] he was sitting there in Sportsman
[53:15] Hollow he sitting there studying the
[53:18] studying over that and trying to find it
[53:20] in the scriptures and how it placed
[53:22] itself in the
[53:23] atonement brother Brandon found out that
[53:25] it was a Eternal atonement that this was
[53:28] was before Calvary these scriptures here
[53:31] were before Calvary but brother brandham
[53:33] had always pondered that how how it fit
[53:36] in the economy of God or the pro in the
[53:38] promises of God but you remember you
[53:40] know exactly what happened that morning
[53:42] while brother bram's sitting there and
[53:43] he's thinking about these things he's
[53:45] thinking about this scripture right here
[53:47] and the Bible said in Jesus answering
[53:49] saith unto them have faith in God ain't
[53:53] that beautiful
[53:55] maybe we say it like this have the faith
[53:57] of God for verily I say unto you that
[54:01] whosoever shall say under this mountain
[54:04] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[54:07] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[54:10] but shall believe that those things
[54:12] which he saith shall come to pass he
[54:15] shall have whatsoever he saith let's say
[54:19] that together
[54:20] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[54:24] you that what thing soever you desire
[54:26] When you pray believe that you receive
[54:29] them and you shall have them amen may
[54:32] God bless his word you may be seated
[54:34] this morning in the presence of the Lord
[54:36] I'd like to take a thought this morning
[54:39] on the Paradox the Paradox of his
[54:42] promise the Paradox of his promise and
[54:44] the Bible says here in Isaiah 40 and
[54:48] verse 28 and I know this is many of our
[54:51] favorite scriptures he said hast thou
[54:53] not known and hast thou not heard that
[54:55] the Everlasting God the Lord the creator
[54:59] of the ends of the Earth Feth not
[55:02] neither is we there is no searching of
[55:05] his understanding so not only does he
[55:07] not faint not but notice the next
[55:09] scripture but he giveth power to the
[55:12] faint ain't it a powerful Paradox laying
[55:14] right there in the scripture that that
[55:16] our God don't faint but he gives power
[55:18] to the faint and to them that have no
[55:20] might he increases he increaseth
[55:22] strength so they that have no might in
[55:24] themselves
[55:25] you find out that he gives them strength
[55:27] and which they can't find in their own
[55:29] in their own might In Their Own Strength
[55:31] but he is their strength even the youth
[55:33] shall faint and be weary and the young
[55:35] men shall utterly fall but here is the
[55:38] Paradox of it but they that wait upon
[55:40] the Lord shall renew their strength they
[55:44] shall Mount up with wings as an eagle
[55:47] and they shall run and not be weary and
[55:50] they shall walk and not faint brother
[55:52] Bron we we realize that brother Brandon
[55:54] would take a thought on Paradox several
[55:56] times and he would always he would
[55:58] always go back and find where the what
[56:01] what Webster said about that word
[56:03] paradox he said I want to take a subject
[56:06] on one word paradox he said and first
[56:08] I'd like to explain maybe what a paradox
[56:11] is in Webster's Dictionary he says it
[56:14] says that a paradox means something
[56:17] that's incredible but true that is a
[56:20] paradox something that is almost
[56:22] completely out of reason and couldn't be
[56:24] so but yet it is that's a paradox and we
[56:28] realize that all the promises of God
[56:30] that are laying here are a complete
[56:32] Paradox to those that are of a carnal
[56:34] mind and it's a carnal it's to a carnal
[56:37] mind you can never comprehend what the
[56:39] promises of God but if you do not have
[56:41] the the spirit of the world but you have
[56:43] the spirit of the one that wrote the
[56:45] word that is the author of the word it
[56:47] is not a paradox to you because you
[56:49] recognize that God is the author of it
[56:52] because you see if you begin to look at
[56:54] what Jesus said in Matthew 1039 that he
[56:57] that findeth his life shall lose it and
[56:59] he that loseth his life for my sake
[57:02] shall find it and it's a complete
[57:03] Paradox right there how that you could
[57:05] lose your life but yet you could find it
[57:07] in him but to those that are true
[57:08] believers you recognize when you lost
[57:11] your life you found his life it's a
[57:13] complete Paradox to the rest of the
[57:15] world how how we were speaking about
[57:17] Samson last night how that he wasn't a
[57:19] great big giant of a man but yet he was
[57:21] a little shrimp he was a little bitty
[57:23] man but yet God would come and anoint
[57:25] him and ordain him for the for the
[57:27] destruction of the Philistines but yet
[57:30] God could so move on him because he had
[57:32] a promise that was over top of her life
[57:34] and we know we know that a lot of people
[57:36] those Philistines could look out there
[57:38] and see the natural elements that were
[57:40] working on on Samson's life that's why
[57:43] there was great fear amongst the
[57:44] Philistines because they had seen Giants
[57:46] they had they had seen they had they had
[57:48] Giants in their own ranks but here was a
[57:51] little bitty old guy that that had the
[57:53] power of 10 men that is upon him it was
[57:56] it was a paradox to them they'd never
[57:57] seen anything like that and I I'll say
[58:00] this that by the Bible that there is
[58:03] there is a people in the land today that
[58:05] are under the same power today that the
[58:07] world cannot understand and they can't
[58:09] comprehend how that you do what you do
[58:13] but this we know that by the scripture
[58:15] reading this morning that whereby are
[58:17] given unto us great and exceeding
[58:20] precious promise so we consider these
[58:23] promises it's not just it's not just a
[58:25] man that is speaking these things but we
[58:27] consider the author of the one that is
[58:29] speaking these promises we understand
[58:31] that that he is that he that he is a God
[58:34] and his promises are absolute they're
[58:37] free they're unconditional they're
[58:39] irresistible and they're irreversible
[58:41] and they're unchangeable and if we look
[58:44] at it in that aspect that God was under
[58:46] no obligation to give us as his as
[58:49] people of the world or people of the
[58:51] land to think that he was under no
[58:54] obligation to make any promises to us
[58:56] but yet he did because he's God and to
[58:58] think that God would he would create a
[59:00] generation and then there would be a
[59:02] generation under Noah's generation that
[59:04] would turn their back on God and and God
[59:06] actually repented of making man but
[59:08] there was something on the inside of God
[59:11] that God longed for the fellowship that
[59:13] he had had once back there in the Garden
[59:15] of Eden and he found a man by the name
[59:17] of Noah that that man was a righteous
[59:20] man he was a holy man he kept the
[59:21] standards of God and God had found a man
[59:24] that he could put his promises in and
[59:26] that man could go out there and build
[59:28] things that were a complete Paradox and
[59:30] it wasn't man constructed but it was God
[59:32] constructed and Noah completely relied
[59:35] upon the promises of God it didn't make
[59:37] no sense to him why he would go out
[59:39] there and choose a a a wood that would
[59:41] be the porest of wood it would be a goph
[59:43] for wood but God had an example laying
[59:46] there in those words that he was given
[59:48] to him he said because you're going to
[59:50] pitch it with tar it's going to show
[59:51] that there's going to be a people that
[59:53] are going to need need to be sealed by
[59:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[59:57] there's a lot of things about the
[59:58] scriptures that maybe a lot of people
[59:59] don't understand but God's got a purpose
[1:00:02] behind every single one of his elements
[1:00:04] and his characters that are laid there
[1:00:06] in the Bible and Noah couldn't explain
[1:00:08] to them how that rain was going to come
[1:00:09] out of the sky but yet he believed that
[1:00:12] God was going to do something
[1:00:13] Supernatural because Noah was a man that
[1:00:17] believed you see Noah was a man that
[1:00:20] believed and this we know that the Bible
[1:00:22] said here Peter tells us that by the
[1:00:24] these promises that we become or or that
[1:00:27] we might be partakers of the divine
[1:00:30] nature you see it's by these promises we
[1:00:32] become by his we become partakers of the
[1:00:36] divine nature and that's exactly in line
[1:00:39] with 1 John 3 and2 that now are we the
[1:00:42] sons of God but it does not yet appear
[1:00:44] what we shall be but we shall be like
[1:00:47] him when we see him so it shows to us
[1:00:49] that by the promises of God we are sons
[1:00:52] of God but if there was not that promise
[1:00:55] laying there how would it be when Satan
[1:00:57] would come against you and try to tell
[1:00:59] you that you're not a son of God it's
[1:01:01] all for days gone by but Peter or John
[1:01:04] wrote it in this way he said but right
[1:01:06] now you are the sons of God and Noah
[1:01:09] didn't have to worry about when it came
[1:01:11] when he was a Son of God because he knew
[1:01:13] that by the promises of God that he was
[1:01:15] perfectly in line with what the
[1:01:17] scripture was saying at that time Noah
[1:01:20] didn't have a bible to read at that time
[1:01:22] but he was looking at the skies and he
[1:01:24] was hearing a voice that God had wrote
[1:01:26] the first Bible up there in the skies
[1:01:28] and he looked up there and he seen a god
[1:01:30] up there and he he handled God he talked
[1:01:32] to God and he recognized that he was now
[1:01:36] a Son of God he didn't have to wait till
[1:01:37] the rain to come before he was a Son of
[1:01:39] God and you you don't have to wait till
[1:01:41] you feel the emotions of the spirit of
[1:01:43] God to find out whether you're a God
[1:01:45] whether you're a Son of God or not you
[1:01:47] can recognize right now by by one little
[1:01:49] simple thing of applying the hiss up
[1:01:52] taking that hiss up and putting it over
[1:01:54] your heart's door and recognize that
[1:01:56] you're a Son of God by the promises of
[1:01:58] God not because of emotions and not
[1:02:00] because of feelings but because the word
[1:02:02] said so that's why Satan wants to give
[1:02:04] you well he puts it in your mind well
[1:02:06] you don't have the same feeling as this
[1:02:08] feeling or or that brother or that
[1:02:09] sister because he can whip you around on
[1:02:11] those feelings but if he can put
[1:02:13] something if he can if he if God can
[1:02:15] ever implant something on the inside of
[1:02:17] your heart that it's the word of God
[1:02:19] that matters most Satan can never whip
[1:02:22] you around upon the promises of God
[1:02:25] that's why he's trying to tear down with
[1:02:26] everything that is within him the power
[1:02:29] of the promises of God but he's been
[1:02:31] doing it for all all these years and the
[1:02:33] gates of hell didn't Prevail against
[1:02:36] it so he does everything do to you to
[1:02:39] make you feel like you're not a
[1:02:40] Christian to make you think that you're
[1:02:41] not a Christian but if you can ever tie
[1:02:43] your soul to an absolute that is the
[1:02:45] word of God you'll find that Satan can
[1:02:48] whip you around all he wants to he can
[1:02:50] try to push you around the stump but you
[1:02:52] know that you've got an absolute solute
[1:02:54] in the promises of
[1:02:56] God but we know this that we cannot read
[1:02:59] the Bible like a
[1:03:02] newspaper because you see you've got to
[1:03:04] read the Bible as it is it's a love
[1:03:07] letter to God's children you see brother
[1:03:10] Bram would tell us he said you can't
[1:03:11] have the faith that you have in the
[1:03:14] Bible that you have in the newspaper he
[1:03:15] said you can't tie those two things
[1:03:17] together he said if you do he said it
[1:03:20] will callous your
[1:03:21] faith it'll callous your faith but you
[1:03:24] see this is that when we see something
[1:03:27] that is laying here in the promises of
[1:03:29] God that maybe seem like they're a
[1:03:30] little bit far off or maybe
[1:03:32] superstitious or a little bit Mystic
[1:03:34] brother Brandon would tell us he said
[1:03:36] all you've got to do is give God just a
[1:03:38] little bit of time and he said his Co
[1:03:41] his cogs or his prophetic wheels will
[1:03:43] roll right on time they'll roll right on
[1:03:46] time and he said it'll develop the
[1:03:48] picture that God had in his mind if you
[1:03:51] can just give God a little bit of time
[1:03:53] this morning maybe you don't see the
[1:03:55] healing working in your body maybe you
[1:03:57] don't see the promise of your children
[1:03:58] coming back yet but if you can give God
[1:04:01] God just a little bit of time he'll make
[1:04:04] good on every one of his promises and
[1:04:07] that's the thing about God God does not
[1:04:09] promise US easy things but neither does
[1:04:12] he fail to fulfill all of his promises
[1:04:14] either if God said it God is the one
[1:04:17] that is obligated to back it up I'm
[1:04:20] simply here as an instrument to preach
[1:04:22] the word of God and God will back up the
[1:04:25] word that I speak if it be true here
[1:04:27] today if I preach to you that Isaiah 53
[1:04:31] is still in effect and your faith aligns
[1:04:34] with that promise then you can watch
[1:04:36] healing come to your body but if your
[1:04:38] faith is in a God that died 2,000 years
[1:04:41] ago and that's as far as it is it'll
[1:04:43] never come to fruition in your life but
[1:04:45] if you can believe that he's the same
[1:04:47] yesterday today and
[1:04:50] forever if you can believe that he
[1:04:53] doesn't do things things that are
[1:04:54] necessarily
[1:04:56] easy but he does things with purpose you
[1:04:59] see God does not promise us a flower bed
[1:05:02] of Eden and brother Brandon would say he
[1:05:04] said we don't want to falsify the
[1:05:06] message by telling people that
[1:05:07] everything's going to be all right he
[1:05:09] said we don't want to go around and
[1:05:10] falsify Christianity and tell them that
[1:05:13] just because you're a Christian that
[1:05:14] you're never going to have problems and
[1:05:16] you're never going to have trials
[1:05:18] because God never promised us those kind
[1:05:20] of things you see he does not promise us
[1:05:23] prosperity he doesn't promise US he
[1:05:25] doesn't promise us a ease of life but
[1:05:27] what he does promise US is that he's
[1:05:29] given us Grace to endure the trials that
[1:05:32] we're going to go through and it might
[1:05:34] be a paradox to you why God does things
[1:05:37] the way that he does but I want you to
[1:05:38] know this it's
[1:05:40] incredible but it's
[1:05:42] true when you go to studying out all the
[1:05:45] characters of the Bible you begin to
[1:05:47] look at all those characters you find
[1:05:49] that God chooses some of the most
[1:05:51] paradoxical people that are in the Bible
[1:05:53] and it's amazing
[1:05:54] you begin to study out just one person's
[1:05:56] life if you go to studying out Jonah's
[1:05:58] life Jonah was a complete Paradox the
[1:06:00] whole book of Jonah was a complete
[1:06:02] Paradox he's a Jew but yet he's sent
[1:06:04] down there to a bunch of ninevites a
[1:06:06] heathen City now that's a complete
[1:06:08] Paradox right there they didn't mingle
[1:06:10] together and you can look at every
[1:06:12] prophet in the Bible and you can see in
[1:06:14] there that there were prophecies that
[1:06:15] was pertaining unto Israel but you can
[1:06:17] read the Book of Jonah and there's not
[1:06:19] one prophecy that is laying there that
[1:06:21] is pertaining unto Israel but it's all
[1:06:24] pertaining to a heathen City now don't
[1:06:27] tell me God ain't a God of a paradox but
[1:06:30] it shows to us that God had a people
[1:06:32] down there that was ready and willing to
[1:06:35] repent at the first preaching of a
[1:06:37] prophet a stranger that would come
[1:06:40] walking out on the tongue of a
[1:06:42] whale talk about a
[1:06:45] paradox because God does things so
[1:06:48] perfectly and you may not understand
[1:06:49] this you may not understand the way God
[1:06:51] does things but when Jonah come walking
[1:06:54] out of that whale's mouth what was it
[1:06:58] they were fish worshippers and they
[1:07:00] recognized that that was a God that they
[1:07:03] were serving down there and when they
[1:07:05] seen Jonah come walking out of that
[1:07:08] whale it was a sign to them that God was
[1:07:11] looking on
[1:07:13] them I tell you the entire story of
[1:07:16] Jonah is a complete Paradox because when
[1:07:18] you see God begin to deal with a gentile
[1:07:21] Nation it is a sign of his in anticipar
[1:07:24] or his anticipation streak of light that
[1:07:28] God was going to light the light to the
[1:07:30] Gentiles and then you were seeing that
[1:07:32] right there in the Book of
[1:07:35] Jonah a prophet of God but yet a run
[1:07:38] away from God a preacher of repentance
[1:07:41] but he didn't want to
[1:07:43] repent I'd say it's a
[1:07:46] paradox save from the jaws of
[1:07:50] death but in the I always get this
[1:07:53] confused I always say it wrong but in
[1:07:55] that whale's belly he finds himself
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:01] repenting but you find him on the other
[1:08:03] side of going down there and preaching
[1:08:05] to Nineveh and you find Jonah in the
[1:08:08] very last chapter of Jonah and he's
[1:08:10] moping because God turns his face
[1:08:13] towards a heathen
[1:08:16] City and he's over there moping because
[1:08:19] his little tree has withered away and
[1:08:22] there sets ninfa over there prospering
[1:08:25] in the mercies of
[1:08:26] God but here is a man that has preached
[1:08:29] in Repentance it's a complete Paradox
[1:08:33] you don't have to try to figure it all
[1:08:34] out but God is a god of his
[1:08:37] word now notice brother man he said now
[1:08:40] God he said Needs Nobody to interpret
[1:08:42] his word he does it his own
[1:08:45] interpretation by bringing it to pass
[1:08:47] the things that he said that he would do
[1:08:49] he said when God said let there be light
[1:08:51] he said there was light he said that
[1:08:53] needs no interpretation he said when God
[1:08:56] said a virgin shall conceive she did
[1:08:58] that doesn't need any interpretation
[1:09:00] when Jesus said the son of man goes up
[1:09:02] to Jerusalem before and be given into
[1:09:05] the hands of sinful men he said they'll
[1:09:07] crucify him and on the third day he'll
[1:09:09] raise again he said that needs no
[1:09:12] interpretation why because he brought it
[1:09:15] to pass that's his interpretation he
[1:09:18] also said a little while and the world
[1:09:20] seeth me no more yet you'll see me for
[1:09:23] I'll be with you even in you to the end
[1:09:25] of the age and to the consummation he
[1:09:27] said he is
[1:09:29] here he doesn't need any interpretation
[1:09:31] of it it's his
[1:09:34] promise you remember when brother random
[1:09:36] would sit there and he said now he said
[1:09:38] now he said I he said I got an old bar
[1:09:40] little knife that's sitting back there
[1:09:41] on my dresser he said I got it sitting
[1:09:43] back there on my dresser he said but if
[1:09:45] I can accumulate the right kind of Faith
[1:09:48] he said God can put it in my pocket in a
[1:09:50] matter of
[1:09:51] moments what was it it's a Paradox to
[1:09:54] try to figure out how that a man could
[1:09:56] speak to a mountain and the mountain be
[1:09:59] removed from hence To Yonder it's a
[1:10:03] paradox it's a paradox when that little
[1:10:05] girl that was saying laying there in
[1:10:07] that bed and and brother Brandon begins
[1:10:09] to speak to her and tells her said if
[1:10:11] you can accumulate the faith he said if
[1:10:13] you can accumulate the faith he said God
[1:10:15] can heal your body and there they were
[1:10:17] they were a different style of
[1:10:19] Christians and there they were they were
[1:10:20] raised up under under under a certain
[1:10:22] thought and brother brandom said he said
[1:10:25] he said but if I could get you to
[1:10:26] believe ain't it amazing that the angel
[1:10:29] would get this he would say this if you
[1:10:31] can get the people to believe
[1:10:33] you if you can get the people to believe
[1:10:36] you you see it's the same way with me
[1:10:37] this morning I can't do anything for you
[1:10:40] unless you believe me and brother
[1:10:42] brandham starts talking to this girl
[1:10:43] she's laying there in that bed and
[1:10:45] brother brandham said do you believe
[1:10:46] that I can take my faith and I can roll
[1:10:49] that little cord that's up there that's
[1:10:50] hanging over top of your bed do you
[1:10:52] believe that I could do that and brother
[1:10:54] bandam said brother bandam said I
[1:10:55] started to do it and she said well
[1:10:57] that's witchcraft he said oh no he said
[1:10:59] that's my faith doing that you see it's
[1:11:01] a complete Paradox to somebody that's
[1:11:03] never seen it before you see it's a
[1:11:05] complete Paradox when you see people
[1:11:07] that starts walking over on dry
[1:11:09] ground and the rest of the world gets
[1:11:12] swallowed up by that same wat it's a
[1:11:14] complete Paradox you can't explain it
[1:11:17] but it's true now you may not believe or
[1:11:20] may not have the same faith that I got
[1:11:23] but I believe belie that every one of
[1:11:24] you sitting here can go in Rapture you
[1:11:27] may not have the kind of faith that I
[1:11:29] got but I got the kind of faith that God
[1:11:31] is the kind of God that I know that he
[1:11:34] can take a people that feel unworthy and
[1:11:37] show them that they're worthy he can
[1:11:38] take the kind of people that look like
[1:11:40] they're out of the picture of God and
[1:11:42] put them right in the picture of God
[1:11:46] hallelujah hallelujah let's have church
[1:11:48] today his promises might be carnal it
[1:11:52] might be hard for the carnal mind to
[1:11:54] comprehend but the
[1:11:56] TRU God
[1:11:58] never abandons his
[1:12:01] promises you might disbel him but God
[1:12:04] never abandons his promises because the
[1:12:06] Bible said in 2 Corinthians 2 and 1 or
[1:12:09] two verse chapter 1 and 20 that all the
[1:12:12] promises of God are in him are yay and
[1:12:16] in him
[1:12:18] amen all the promises of God are in him
[1:12:21] and are yay and a amen and now notice
[1:12:24] what what the message to this leot and
[1:12:27] age is that these things saith the amen
[1:12:31] so Jesus is the Amen brother mam said in
[1:12:34] the layot ofy in church age he said he
[1:12:36] never changes what he does he never
[1:12:38] changes it he says it and it stands fast
[1:12:41] he does it and it is done forever none
[1:12:44] can take from them what he says or what
[1:12:46] he or none can take from what he says or
[1:12:49] add to it so let it be amen so let it be
[1:12:52] aren't you glad that you serve that kind
[1:12:55] of a
[1:12:56] God you can know exactly where you are
[1:12:59] with him at any time and all the time he
[1:13:02] is the amen and God won't
[1:13:07] change these things sayith the amen he
[1:13:09] said I like that he said it means that
[1:13:11] whatever he said it's final it means
[1:13:14] that whatever he said to the first age
[1:13:16] and the second and all the ages about
[1:13:18] his own true church and about the false
[1:13:20] Vine is exactly right and it won't
[1:13:22] change it means that what he started out
[1:13:25] with in Genesis he will finish in
[1:13:27] Revelation he has to for he is the amen
[1:13:32] so let it be it might be hard to explain
[1:13:36] but yet it's true it might be hard for
[1:13:39] you to comprehend but he true and When
[1:13:42] God says you're healed it's final When
[1:13:45] God says you're filled it's final When
[1:13:47] God says you're going to make it it's
[1:13:49] final who who can turn back the hand of
[1:13:53] of almighty God if God's got a purpose
[1:13:56] in extending his hand of Mercy to you
[1:13:58] who in the right mind and who all the
[1:14:00] powers of hell can turn back the very
[1:14:03] power of the hand of the almighty God
[1:14:07] Satan can send all of his powers from
[1:14:09] Hell against one child and they can
[1:14:12] never turn back the
[1:14:14] hand of almighty
[1:14:17] God let me let me continue to lay these
[1:14:20] things here brother bandam said in the
[1:14:22] message paradox he said we know his word
[1:14:25] is a paradox he said when it promises
[1:14:28] something that is so unreal to the world
[1:14:31] something that they cannot prescribe to
[1:14:33] it's something beyond their knowledge
[1:14:36] it's something that's beyond their
[1:14:39] understanding he said but when a simple
[1:14:41] heart will take that word and sink it
[1:14:44] into the depths of its being then that
[1:14:46] word produces the live facts of that
[1:14:50] promise what happened when Gideon
[1:14:52] started taking God at his word and
[1:14:54] believe that he was a mighty man of
[1:14:56] Valor he went down there with 300 men
[1:14:59] and whipped
[1:15:00] 122,000 midianites why because he took
[1:15:03] the very word of God and when you as a
[1:15:06] simple heart begin to take the promises
[1:15:09] of God and let it sink in there you
[1:15:11] become the live
[1:15:13] facts of the
[1:15:18] promise when God promised
[1:15:20] Zacharias he's sitting there and he and
[1:15:22] he's worshiping God in his Temple he's
[1:15:25] worshiping in the office of a priest
[1:15:27] he's there and he's offering unto God
[1:15:30] and God begins to speak to him by the
[1:15:31] angel Gabriel and he tells him said now
[1:15:34] look you and Elizabeth y'all been
[1:15:36] without child for a long time but things
[1:15:38] are about to
[1:15:40] change now brother bam said he said it
[1:15:42] would have been easy he said it was e
[1:15:44] should have been easy for Zacharias and
[1:15:46] Elizabeth to believe that he said
[1:15:48] because he said because it had happened
[1:15:51] in the scripture before he said but when
[1:15:53] the angel goes over there and starts
[1:15:55] talking to Mary she had nobody in the
[1:15:58] Bible that she could point back to and
[1:16:01] look back there and say that this is the
[1:16:03] way it was back then so I know that
[1:16:05] it'll be this way for me she had nobody
[1:16:08] to look to John John his parents had the
[1:16:11] ability to look back there to Abraham
[1:16:13] and Sarah and say yeah it's incredible
[1:16:17] but it's true and they doubt it they
[1:16:20] doubt it and zachariah's mouth was shut
[1:16:22] until John was
[1:16:24] born come on now but when Mary first
[1:16:28] heard the salutation of the Angel she
[1:16:31] said be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:16:35] she couldn't explain
[1:16:39] it a 16year old girl couldn't explain
[1:16:42] how that
[1:16:44] happened but yet it was
[1:16:47] true he' let her all her life so why I
[1:16:50] doubt him
[1:16:52] now you know if you got a voice that'll
[1:16:54] tell you the truth you ought to follow
[1:16:56] it you know when when Hatty R's sitting
[1:16:59] there and she's hearing about Mark 11
[1:17:01] and she's hearing about Jehovah Gyra
[1:17:03] that he was a s Jehovah Gyra that was
[1:17:05] back there with Abraham that he was that
[1:17:07] s Jehovah Gyra up there in Sportsman
[1:17:09] holla brother bam said all I can say to
[1:17:12] y'all is that he's still the same
[1:17:14] yesterday today and forever and brother
[1:17:16] ROM said that when Haddie said that he
[1:17:19] said she said the right thing and he
[1:17:21] said when she did he said he called when
[1:17:23] she said that it called to the heart of
[1:17:26] Jehovah by her saying the right thing
[1:17:29] and when brother Bram said it called it
[1:17:31] called the heart of Jehovah he said the
[1:17:34] Lord said give her whatever she asked
[1:17:37] for don't you recognize you're sitting
[1:17:40] here today you're not in need of
[1:17:43] squirrels but some of you are sitting
[1:17:45] here in need of your prodical some of
[1:17:47] you are sitting here and you're in need
[1:17:49] of healing some of you are in here and
[1:17:51] you're in need of answers
[1:17:53] but oh if you could just say the right
[1:17:56] thing and call to the heart of Jehovah
[1:17:59] what would it do in a service like this
[1:18:01] God would say give them whatever they
[1:18:04] want what was it she said the right
[1:18:07] thing and when she said the right
[1:18:10] thing what did he do she didn't ask for
[1:18:17] money she asked for the most righteous
[1:18:19] thing something
[1:18:21] eternal what are you going to do with a
[1:18:25] paradox sitting in front of you hadie
[1:18:28] are you going to believe him that he
[1:18:30] could still produce squirrels are you
[1:18:32] still going to believe him that he's got
[1:18:34] a sacrifice for you howy are you still
[1:18:37] going to believe him when things are
[1:18:39] worse and it doesn't look like your sons
[1:18:41] are coming Haddie are you still going to
[1:18:43] believe him yeah i' say it's a paradox
[1:18:47] but it's a
[1:18:49] promise hallelujah it's a promise this
[1:18:52] morning he's the kind of God that never
[1:18:55] backs off of his promises he's the kind
[1:18:57] of God that doesn't give up on his
[1:18:59] promises he's the kind of God that knows
[1:19:02] where they are and he's that kind of a
[1:19:04] God that he thought of them before the
[1:19:06] foundation of the
[1:19:08] world I walked out there outside the
[1:19:11] house the other morning about 3:00 in
[1:19:13] the morning just walking around and I
[1:19:15] started looking up there at them stars
[1:19:17] and admiring the stars and I thought God
[1:19:20] before them Stars was ever into
[1:19:22] existence they was in your mind and I
[1:19:25] started just worshiping the Lord right
[1:19:26] there nobody in the neighborhood knew
[1:19:28] what was going on but I was out there
[1:19:30] praising
[1:19:32] God that God had those things all of
[1:19:35] those Stars up there that are more than
[1:19:37] the Sands that are upon the seashores of
[1:19:39] the
[1:19:40] Earth but God had them in his mind but
[1:19:43] before there was ever spoken to
[1:19:45] existence there was a
[1:19:47] thought but I looked at them stars and I
[1:19:50] said before you was created I was in his
[1:19:54] mind before you ever heard the hanging
[1:19:56] there throughout the galaxies I was in
[1:19:59] his
[1:20:03] mind
[1:20:05] hallelujah hallelujah you see it's value
[1:20:09] had he valued the one that was speaking
[1:20:11] to her because she'd always trusted
[1:20:14] she'd always trusted his word she'd
[1:20:16] always seen everything that he had said
[1:20:18] that had come to pass and why I doubt
[1:20:20] him now let me ask Abraham he has been
[1:20:23] talking to you all the way from Genesis
[1:20:25] 12 all the way through surely you can
[1:20:28] trust him up there in Genesis 22 surely
[1:20:30] you can trust him when he ask you to
[1:20:32] give your only begotten son surely you
[1:20:34] can trust
[1:20:39] him let me just drop this real quick you
[1:20:42] know I never had the opportunity of
[1:20:44] meeting my grand Pat M Aly
[1:20:47] and by the sound of it he's quite the
[1:20:49] guy but you know I never I never had the
[1:20:51] opportunity to meet him but I'd always
[1:20:53] been told about when he'd go over there
[1:20:55] and fish Silver Lake there was a certain
[1:20:57] spot that Miley would go over there and
[1:20:58] he fish at you know I never I never did
[1:21:01] meet him or anything but I'd always been
[1:21:03] told that Miley go over there and he'
[1:21:04] get back in the back side of that corner
[1:21:06] and he' fish out of there and he said
[1:21:07] that was the best spot now you know I
[1:21:10] I'd never met him you know whether I
[1:21:11] thought about it or not subconsciously
[1:21:13] I'd always found myself always back
[1:21:15] there in that same hole that they said
[1:21:17] Miley was fishing at I go back there and
[1:21:21] sometimes it didn't work out for me but
[1:21:23] one day it
[1:21:24] did one day it did it caught one of the
[1:21:26] best fish I ever ever did catch because
[1:21:29] you see I was relying I'd never fish
[1:21:30] that pond before but they told me they
[1:21:33] told me that's where Miley fished at so
[1:21:35] I went back there according to what I
[1:21:38] had heard and I went back there and I
[1:21:40] had myself a jubilee back there and you
[1:21:43] know good and well that there is value
[1:21:46] in the voice i' never met Miley but i'
[1:21:48] heard about it you know I'd never I
[1:21:51] maybe never met the god that Ryan
[1:21:53] Spencer or Homer Fraser knew until a
[1:21:55] certain time but I'd heard about
[1:21:57] him and I trusted the voice so the same
[1:22:01] voice that I trusted to go back there to
[1:22:03] that fishing hole was the same voice
[1:22:05] that had told me Hallelujah he's said
[1:22:08] God that cares for you now if God could
[1:22:12] deposit something like that on the
[1:22:13] inside of a human being that they would
[1:22:15] subconsciously go back to a fishing
[1:22:18] hole go back there to a fishing hole
[1:22:21] where their granddaddy had fish that
[1:22:23] many many years before you know they
[1:22:25] probably been a many of people fish back
[1:22:27] there and never thought one thing about
[1:22:29] Miley Fraser fishing back there but it
[1:22:31] was in my mind that my granddaddy fish
[1:22:33] back here it was in my mind that my
[1:22:35] granddaddy caught some big trout back
[1:22:37] here it was in my mind that my
[1:22:39] granddaddy had caught some good fish
[1:22:41] back there and I went back there with
[1:22:43] that in my mind that if my granddaddy
[1:22:46] could have done it then I can do it too
[1:22:48] that's the same way with the promises of
[1:22:50] God that I can look in there and I I can
[1:22:52] see Homer fras praying for somebody in a
[1:22:55] hospital room and I can see him walking
[1:22:56] out of the pro out of that hospital room
[1:22:59] completely made well and I can say like
[1:23:01] job said in job 42 and5 I have heard of
[1:23:04] thee by the hearing of the ear but now I
[1:23:06] see I have the same ability that Homer
[1:23:10] Fraser had I have the same ability that
[1:23:12] Peter had I have the same ability that
[1:23:15] William brandham had this ain't some
[1:23:17] fishing hole it's the message of the
[1:23:19] hour and I got the same ability to lay
[1:23:23] hands on the sick and they
[1:23:26] shall it might be a paradox to you how
[1:23:29] that a hillbilly a country boy out of
[1:23:31] the Pilot Mountain would come and lay
[1:23:33] his hands upon you and all of a sudden
[1:23:35] the rush of Heaven would roll over top
[1:23:37] of
[1:23:39] you it ain't me it's the one you heard
[1:23:42] about this is more than a fishing
[1:23:45] story God's getting a rainbow trap kind
[1:23:48] of people a coveted
[1:23:51] people
[1:23:58] Hallelujah brother said now I might
[1:24:01] break my promise cuz I'm a
[1:24:04] man and your friend might break his
[1:24:06] promise or her promise God will not
[1:24:10] break his
[1:24:11] promise he can't because he's God could
[1:24:13] you imagine how pure and unadulterated
[1:24:16] his promises are how infinite he said
[1:24:18] why if I'd go to a spring that my
[1:24:20] grandfather drank out of one time or
[1:24:22] spring that it was it was clear and
[1:24:24] tested the water he said it was 100%
[1:24:26] pure my father drank out of it he said
[1:24:29] it was 100% pure and all down through my
[1:24:31] life I I drank out of it and 100% pure
[1:24:35] why I'd have enough Faith to go back
[1:24:36] there and believe if I take a drink of
[1:24:38] that water it'd be all right for me now
[1:24:41] if we can do that by what somebody else
[1:24:43] has said surely we can take God at his
[1:24:46] word that David would say in Psalms 13
[1:24:50] oh bless the Lord oh my soul
[1:24:53] oh oh bless the Lord oh my soul and
[1:24:56] blessed be His holy name bless the Lord
[1:24:59] oh my soul and forget not all of his
[1:25:02] benefits he forgiveth all of thine
[1:25:04] iniquities who Health all of thy
[1:25:06] diseases who redeemeth thy life from
[1:25:08] destruction who cth thee with loving
[1:25:11] kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy
[1:25:14] thy mouth with good things so that thy
[1:25:18] youth is renewed like the
[1:25:21] eagles
[1:25:24] Hallelujah does he still got benefits
[1:25:26] for his
[1:25:31] children now some of you don't
[1:25:33] understand
[1:25:35] this but we've been standing here and
[1:25:38] we've been
[1:25:39] preaching and we are watching the very
[1:25:43] manifestation of the promises come to
[1:25:45] pass you know when you wait on something
[1:25:48] for so
[1:25:49] long A lot of times you don't recognize
[1:25:51] it until it's already
[1:25:54] passed but God does some things right in
[1:25:56] front of you so that you can't miss
[1:25:59] them is that right you can pray about it
[1:26:03] and all of a sudden it comes into
[1:26:04] fruition just look at
[1:26:06] Gabriel we prayed for him all them years
[1:26:10] but now he's here look at brother Jason
[1:26:12] back there we prayed for him all those
[1:26:14] years those years of prayer and fasting
[1:26:16] was not in vain because they're here and
[1:26:19] it's like praying for brother Ron it was
[1:26:21] like it's like praying for brother on
[1:26:23] it's not in vain this morning your faith
[1:26:25] is not in vain this morning all of your
[1:26:28] faith is being accumulated to one spot
[1:26:31] and when God takes your faith and puts
[1:26:34] it all
[1:26:36] together what's God going to do I I was
[1:26:39] simply I'll be honest about got more
[1:26:41] than I could handle last night when I
[1:26:43] heard the culmination of all those
[1:26:45] voices last night screaming out all all
[1:26:49] one thing all they was all screaming out
[1:26:51] and I know we we had more people
[1:26:52] screaming out don't do it than actually
[1:26:54] was there when Jesus was there 2,000
[1:26:56] years ago but it gave us a good
[1:26:57] illustration of all the voices that was
[1:27:00] coming together and they were they were
[1:27:01] screaming and hollering I I be honest it
[1:27:03] it was overwhelming just to think about
[1:27:05] think about being in that part of the
[1:27:08] story and I never want to find myself in
[1:27:10] the seat of s sitting there and
[1:27:11] crucifying the Flesh of the word of God
[1:27:14] right here right now today but you could
[1:27:16] you imagine when when I was sitting
[1:27:18] there I begin to think about this all in
[1:27:20] that moment I begin to think now what if
[1:27:22] we could all turn our voice loose to the
[1:27:24] promises of God and saying yes to them
[1:27:28] that we could say that he is the Lord
[1:27:30] who forgiveth me of all of my iniquities
[1:27:32] and heals all of my diseases and we
[1:27:35] could come together with one great big
[1:27:37] shout of yes what would it would be
[1:27:40] tonight if we if we would sit here in
[1:27:42] one mind in one Accord if we could sit
[1:27:45] here not no isms not no skepticism not
[1:27:48] one big one and not one little one but
[1:27:51] as a body word
[1:27:52] begin to accumulate all of these
[1:27:55] promises together and put them all
[1:27:57] together and all of you say well I don't
[1:28:00] know exactly how it's going to be but
[1:28:02] yes to it that he is still Isaiah 53 he
[1:28:05] was wounded for my transgressions he was
[1:28:08] bruised for my iniquities the
[1:28:10] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:28:12] and by his tribes I am healed I know
[1:28:15] it's a paradox that you is a high priest
[1:28:18] of your profession but I believe that if
[1:28:20] you can hold fast your profession in
[1:28:22] faith
[1:28:27] today brother Brit said something very
[1:28:30] powerful at sister Erica's at sister
[1:28:32] Erica's uh funeral the other day he said
[1:28:35] our faith he said we didn't he said we
[1:28:37] didn't have weak Faith he said it wasn't
[1:28:39] that he said we have very strong faith
[1:28:41] he had he said we had very strong faith
[1:28:44] and I know that sometimes when you you
[1:28:46] get to a certain spot and you're praying
[1:28:47] for a certain thing that a lot of times
[1:28:49] you may feel like you're disappointed
[1:28:51] you might feel like it you didn't get
[1:28:52] the answer that maybe you were wanting
[1:28:54] but I found this in life that God's nose
[1:28:57] are also as good as his Essence and I
[1:29:00] know this that that your faith was not
[1:29:02] in vain when you were praying for sister
[1:29:03] Erica and just like it's not in vain
[1:29:05] right now when you're praying for
[1:29:07] brother Donnie and sister Carol your
[1:29:08] faith is not in vain that God is a God
[1:29:11] of all comfort so if we've got that kind
[1:29:13] of a faith that God would care so much
[1:29:16] that he would release her from the grips
[1:29:18] of cancer how much more is he able to
[1:29:22] say yes that I can heal this one or I
[1:29:24] can heal that one you say well I prayed
[1:29:27] all those times and it don't look like
[1:29:29] it availed to anything oh yes it did
[1:29:31] Satan
[1:29:41] lost I know we've been we've been
[1:29:43] talking about Zoe here and that I I'll
[1:29:45] be honest it's pretty overwhelming if
[1:29:48] you just set back as a family we set
[1:29:50] back in the last month you begin to
[1:29:52] y'all heard us talking about how how
[1:29:54] that God's going to God's going to bless
[1:29:55] her she's going to start talking but if
[1:29:57] you'd hear that little baby
[1:29:59] talk you'd say it's the Wonder workking
[1:30:02] power of almighty God it's already
[1:30:03] working now what happened it was
[1:30:05] somebody that believed what doctors had
[1:30:08] said would never be that she wouldn't
[1:30:10] talk till she was 20 years old and maybe
[1:30:12] never talk that way but somebody took a
[1:30:14] hold of the promise and that little baby
[1:30:16] back there is talking like never before
[1:30:19] she may not be as advanced as maybe this
[1:30:21] one or that one but because somebody
[1:30:23] grabbed a hold of the promise and said
[1:30:25] yes to it what would happen in here
[1:30:27] today if you would say God I see you
[1:30:30] talking about a people that's going in a
[1:30:32] Rapture yes I see you talking about a
[1:30:35] people that believe that all things are
[1:30:37] possible yes I see you talking about God
[1:30:40] being able to create a ram and create
[1:30:42] squirrels then God you can produce the
[1:30:45] powerful right now if God's that kind of
[1:30:48] a God that he can create squirrels
[1:30:50] surely
[1:30:52] surely he can do the impossible in every
[1:30:55] one of our Lives it's a
[1:30:58] paradox but it's
[1:31:01] [Applause]
[1:31:06] true imagine homop frasia running with
[1:31:09] everything that's within him you think
[1:31:11] about it think about him sister Francis
[1:31:13] you saw him in his youth you saw him
[1:31:14] brother Vernon youve seen him preached
[1:31:16] with the same passion that he would
[1:31:18] preach with all the way up until his
[1:31:20] death but could you imagine
[1:31:22] where this bride is at today and brother
[1:31:24] hom said I was a part of that I was a
[1:31:28] part of that they might be on beyond the
[1:31:31] curtain of time but they are still a
[1:31:33] part of the promise right
[1:31:37] now hallelujah hallelujah can't you see
[1:31:41] it right here right now that there's a
[1:31:44] host of angels that are gather around
[1:31:46] this building there's a people that's G
[1:31:48] going on and they're saying it's a
[1:31:50] paradox but it's a real land it's a real
[1:31:53] home it's a real heaven it's worth
[1:31:56] fighting
[1:31:58] for come on little bride it's everything
[1:32:02] you dreamed of he ain't going to let you
[1:32:07] [Applause]
[1:32:10] down I'm begin to think back
[1:32:13] here I begin to think
[1:32:17] about about this the salt sometimes you
[1:32:20] just the thought begins to get a little
[1:32:22] bit bigger
[1:32:23] than than you and you recognize that
[1:32:26] you're just in the the mind of the
[1:32:29] Lord I begin to think about brother Joe
[1:32:32] shifflet begin to think about how
[1:32:35] that how that brother Homer had
[1:32:37] witnessed to them to him all those times
[1:32:40] brother Joe was hidden that hdden that
[1:32:41] way to the church there believe it was
[1:32:43] Summit Avenue if I if I got that right
[1:32:45] maybe maybe was on one of the others
[1:32:47] places there but I believe it was Summit
[1:32:48] but anyways it doesn't matter he is at
[1:32:50] one of churches but either way brother
[1:32:54] brother Homer had was been back there
[1:32:55] and he was he was preparing but the Lord
[1:32:58] spoke to him said now go out there and
[1:32:59] wait on the porch because Joe's not
[1:33:01] going to come in Joe's not going to come
[1:33:03] in until unless you're setting up there
[1:33:06] he's done set it in his heart he's not
[1:33:07] going to come into there unless brother
[1:33:09] Homer sitting on the porch and when
[1:33:10] brother Joe rode up there there was
[1:33:12] brother Homer sitting on the
[1:33:14] porch I want you to hear me soldier boy
[1:33:17] I want you to hear me there's a daddy
[1:33:18] that's sitting on the porch for
[1:33:20] you and say I'm waiting for you to come
[1:33:22] on in come on in here come on soldja boy
[1:33:26] you're not going to commit suicide come
[1:33:27] on in soldier boy there's a daddy that's
[1:33:29] waiting for you it's more than your
[1:33:31] fleshly daddy that's waiting for you the
[1:33:33] papa God is waiting for you and his
[1:33:35] promises are yes and amen hallelujah
[1:33:39] time and science might be against God's
[1:33:41] promises but God is the god of his word
[1:33:45] there's a daddy that's sitting on the
[1:33:47] porch said come on home
[1:33:50] children come on home children I'd say
[1:33:53] mamas and daddies you've been looking
[1:33:55] for them you've been asking for them but
[1:33:57] I'd say It's Time to Kill the fatty calf
[1:34:00] stop looking for him and start rejoicing
[1:34:03] over
[1:34:06] [Applause]
[1:34:19] it imagine Abraham
[1:34:23] your faith is not in
[1:34:25] vain you waited 25 years for
[1:34:28] this but it's not in vain but brother BR
[1:34:31] I I found this brother said that God had
[1:34:33] been testing the patriarch because he
[1:34:35] had give him a promise and when God
[1:34:38] makes a promise he said he wants to be
[1:34:40] sure that this person is worthy of the
[1:34:44] promise before he fulfills what he said
[1:34:47] that he would promise what he had
[1:34:48] promised
[1:34:49] him you imagine 25
[1:34:53] years that's a short time compared to
[1:34:56] 120 years of saying it's going to rain
[1:34:57] but for 25 years Abraham been preaching
[1:35:00] I'm going to have a son and his name's
[1:35:02] going to be called Isaac you
[1:35:06] imagine you imagine as Abraham
[1:35:09] is he's got everything in order all all
[1:35:12] his faith is in order his his promises
[1:35:14] are lining up everything his faith he's
[1:35:16] got his he's got his he's got his home
[1:35:18] under the message he's got it under the
[1:35:19] token and everything and then MDC shows
[1:35:22] up at his house brother
[1:35:23] Chris and he
[1:35:25] recognizes that this is the acceptable
[1:35:27] time of the Lord and he begins to move
[1:35:30] into the
[1:35:31] promise now you you imagine how Abraham
[1:35:35] felt when mzc comes to his tent door and
[1:35:38] sits
[1:35:39] there and he starts Discerning the very
[1:35:42] thoughts of his wife's heart that's
[1:35:44] sitting behind the
[1:35:45] tent and Abraham would say that's the
[1:35:48] same voice I've listened to that's the
[1:35:50] one that led me
[1:35:52] that's the one that letting me out of my
[1:35:53] daddy's home that's the same one that
[1:35:54] spoke to me to go down there and get lot
[1:35:57] that's the same one that told me down
[1:35:58] there and I I paid ties to them it's the
[1:36:00] same
[1:36:02] one imagine that's the same sign in this
[1:36:07] generation and now I I'll turn my back
[1:36:09] to you and I can't see you but I see
[1:36:12] that there's a woman sitting back there
[1:36:14] in a red dress and she's got a dark
[1:36:15] shadow that keeps following her and and
[1:36:17] it's following her but thus saith the
[1:36:20] Lord It's Over
[1:36:22] what is it it was the same it was the
[1:36:24] same Messiah sign that was being
[1:36:26] expressed in Abraham's life that there
[1:36:28] all of a sudden that all of his faith
[1:36:31] had been to a spot it all came
[1:36:34] together and all of a sudden things
[1:36:37] begin to change in his life he starts
[1:36:39] stepping into the vision of the message
[1:36:41] and he starts walking into and he he's
[1:36:43] perfectly in line with all of those
[1:36:45] things that that what he's seeing is a
[1:36:47] complete invisible Union that has taken
[1:36:49] place by the grace of God and he he he's
[1:36:51] watching it and all of his faith has
[1:36:52] come together he didn't believe and he
[1:36:55] didn't believe he didn't believe that
[1:36:56] God was going to fail him but the Bible
[1:36:58] said that he staggered not at the
[1:37:01] promises of God but there all of this is
[1:37:03] coming together and everything's coming
[1:37:05] into fruition all of a sudden can you
[1:37:07] imagine how he
[1:37:10] felt when he sees Isaac face to face and
[1:37:15] they call me crazy call me crazy but I I
[1:37:18] just happen to believe that Abraham and
[1:37:19] Sarah had thems a good little dancing
[1:37:21] party right there they Sarah may have
[1:37:23] been the very first one to ever shout at
[1:37:24] a woman that just gave birth to a baby
[1:37:26] and Shout outside the hospital room but
[1:37:28] I happen to believe that there that
[1:37:30] little woman had so much so much Zeal
[1:37:32] and passion on the inside of her that I
[1:37:35] have not believed in vain that
[1:37:37] everything that I hope for and it might
[1:37:39] be a paradox that God would take a 100y
[1:37:41] old man and a 90y old woman and turn
[1:37:43] them back new again but I believed it I
[1:37:46] believed it and you can look in the Old
[1:37:48] Testament and you can see where Sarah
[1:37:50] doubted but you can look in the New
[1:37:52] Testament and it's not even found in the
[1:37:55] picture what is it it's a sign that the
[1:37:58] blood was good enough to curse your past
[1:38:01] and bless your
[1:38:05] future the promises of God can't be held
[1:38:09] back remember the prophet God dropped in
[1:38:12] his heart you're going to have a
[1:38:15] Joseph you're going to have a
[1:38:20] Joseph
[1:38:22] here he's got Billy Here Comes Rebecca
[1:38:23] and here comes Sarah and all them people
[1:38:25] started mocking him but God had already
[1:38:28] dropped it into his heart that you're
[1:38:30] going to have a Joseph and the doctor
[1:38:32] done told him said now look your wife
[1:38:35] can no longer she cannot handle having
[1:38:36] any more children brother Bron told that
[1:38:39] doctor said now look I've been promised
[1:38:41] that I'm going to have a son and he's
[1:38:42] going to come forth can you imagine you
[1:38:45] can imagine about all them mockers and
[1:38:47] brother Bram said that them people were
[1:38:48] sitting around there when there came out
[1:38:50] Sarah and Rebecca and they said maybe
[1:38:52] you meant
[1:38:53] Josephine he said but when Joseph showed
[1:38:56] up he said there I was he said I was
[1:38:58] there he said Joseph it sure took you a
[1:39:00] long time to get here but thank God that
[1:39:02] you're here you can sit there and all
[1:39:05] the Skeptics are sitting there but
[1:39:06] because God dropped the message in your
[1:39:09] heart you have not believed in vain 400
[1:39:13] years the children of Israel had
[1:39:15] believed had believed that God was going
[1:39:18] to take them out of the land of Egypt
[1:39:19] and time was increasing the pressure of
[1:39:24] it time increased the pressure of it but
[1:39:27] God was as good as his word that he told
[1:39:30] Abraham that they would sojourn in a
[1:39:32] Strange Land but I'm going to give them
[1:39:34] this land time was increasing against
[1:39:38] him the pressures of life but don't you
[1:39:41] see what pressure produces it produces
[1:39:45] gold they waited for it look at them
[1:39:50] look at them there brother M said that
[1:39:52] faith is designed to see what God wants
[1:39:54] he said how do you see it through the
[1:39:55] camera of his word his promise he said
[1:39:57] there this is a full revelation of Jesus
[1:40:00] Christ he said and when that Faith
[1:40:02] that's in you focus you to the word
[1:40:04] you're focused away from all the
[1:40:05] denominations agrees and everything
[1:40:07] you're focused right straight on the
[1:40:09] word and you're zeroed in on it it only
[1:40:12] it only needs a little touch off amen he
[1:40:15] said the prayer flies straight into the
[1:40:17] presence of God because there's nothing
[1:40:19] to stop it he said that's what does it
[1:40:21] when you're zeroed in with God and
[1:40:23] focused in by then you're looking at the
[1:40:26] Target he said you're not looking at
[1:40:28] what somebody else says this can't
[1:40:30] happen and that can't happen he said but
[1:40:32] you're looking to what you know did
[1:40:34] happen you look on to your target you
[1:40:37] see what they hit if they hit it in that
[1:40:39] day and he's the same yesterday today
[1:40:41] and forever he said Focus out all the
[1:40:43] Creeds and things you got mixed up and
[1:40:45] go right back to the word then confess
[1:40:47] your unbelief and let God take his Holy
[1:40:50] Spirit and direct your right your sights
[1:40:52] right straight onto Jesus Christ we're
[1:40:54] looking to him then not what somebody
[1:40:57] else says I know it's incredible but if
[1:41:01] you can align your faith with the word
[1:41:03] of God I know it's incredible that you
[1:41:05] that there is in this generation of
[1:41:07] people that
[1:41:09] believe a people that can take
[1:41:11] Deuteronomy 22 and5 and make it live a
[1:41:14] people a lady a sister of the grace can
[1:41:16] take a 1 Corinthians 11 and make him
[1:41:18] live it's incredible but it's true and
[1:41:21] God is not backing off of his promises
[1:41:24] God does not forget his promises you
[1:41:26] imagine when God is speaking to Elijah
[1:41:28] and Elisha asked a hard thing of Elijah
[1:41:30] said I want a double
[1:41:33] portion I want a double portion and he
[1:41:37] asked him he asked a hard thing of him
[1:41:40] but God granted him he said when you see
[1:41:41] if you see me when I go did not he say
[1:41:44] the same thing to you yet a little while
[1:41:46] and the world can't see me but you'll
[1:41:47] see
[1:41:49] me and God had granted him a double
[1:41:51] portion and you imagine all the markers
[1:41:52] sitting
[1:41:54] around he was one short of his
[1:41:57] promises Elijah had eight Miracles and
[1:42:01] Elisha had should have had 16 but he
[1:42:03] only got
[1:42:04] 15 but God is the god of
[1:42:07] paradox and when they took that Soldier
[1:42:11] and they threw him in there on a Dead
[1:42:13] Man's Bones God was a god of paradox and
[1:42:16] showed that he had the power that the
[1:42:18] quickening power of almighty God was
[1:42:20] still he upon Elijah's
[1:42:23] bones and It produced The
[1:42:25] Miraculous what is it is when God begins
[1:42:28] to take the burden of the word that God
[1:42:31] releases his burden by bringing his
[1:42:34] promises to pass you know when you know
[1:42:37] when brother brandham is is preaching
[1:42:39] he's telling he's working his way
[1:42:41] through he that is in you and a lot of
[1:42:43] people listen to that sermon and they
[1:42:44] think one Bar's just telling stories
[1:42:46] he's more than telling stories he's
[1:42:48] telling you about a god that is in you
[1:42:50] that is greater than than he that is in
[1:42:51] the world you remember brother brandham
[1:42:54] is there he's there on Colorado mountain
[1:42:56] and he starts speaking to the
[1:42:58] storm and and you remember the whole
[1:43:00] entire story and I don't want to go
[1:43:01] through the whole thing but you know the
[1:43:03] story and there brother brandham he said
[1:43:05] he starts he starts walking down through
[1:43:07] there and those deer had come up to him
[1:43:09] but but you remember you remember that
[1:43:11] brother brandham said I I had carried
[1:43:12] this burden for four to five years i'
[1:43:15] carried this burden 4 to 5 years and he
[1:43:17] said I I he said I did everything that I
[1:43:18] could to get rid of that to get rid of
[1:43:20] that burden he said I prayed he said I
[1:43:22] asked God to take it away from me and he
[1:43:23] said I I kept praying and I kept asking
[1:43:25] and it just seemed like it wasn't it
[1:43:26] would never
[1:43:27] leave he said he said but what it was he
[1:43:30] said he said I I had told all those men
[1:43:33] that I would go out there and kill wild
[1:43:35] game for him he said they would ask for
[1:43:36] an elk and I'd go out there and he said
[1:43:38] he said he said I'd go out there and
[1:43:40] kill something for him he said i' go out
[1:43:41] there and he said he said but God be to
[1:43:43] condemn my heart and he said that wasn't
[1:43:44] right and he said I was doing those
[1:43:46] things because those men he said but he
[1:43:48] said there I was and he said i' done
[1:43:50] told the Lord now Lord I'm not going to
[1:43:52] kill anymore for anybody else I'm just
[1:43:54] going to take what's for me now brother
[1:43:57] Brandon is up there after he speaks to
[1:43:58] that storm and those deer come up close
[1:44:00] and I believe that they seen something
[1:44:02] on the inside of William brandham that
[1:44:04] they saw back there in the Garden of
[1:44:05] Eden they seen somebody speaking to the
[1:44:08] natural elements he was speaking to the
[1:44:11] mountain and he speaks of that and those
[1:44:13] deer come up there and you remember that
[1:44:16] brother bham said I just said now you're
[1:44:17] in my life I could take your life right
[1:44:20] now
[1:44:22] they said but I just shoed them off said
[1:44:24] go on go on go on I'm not going to do it
[1:44:27] and he said when I did that the spirit
[1:44:29] of the Lord began to speak to me and
[1:44:32] said you remembered your promise and he
[1:44:35] said and I'll remember mine that I'll
[1:44:38] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[1:44:41] you he said right then right then the
[1:44:44] burden left me right there it's a sign
[1:44:47] to you that when you keep your promise
[1:44:50] the the burden will leave you don't you
[1:44:52] see that that's how the burden leaves
[1:44:54] almighty God is when he brings his
[1:44:57] promises to
[1:44:59] pass you might think it's a little bit
[1:45:01] strange you might think it's a little
[1:45:03] bit far reaching but do you recognize
[1:45:06] that if you're believing for a certain
[1:45:08] need or a certain situation that the
[1:45:11] only way that God can relieve the burden
[1:45:14] off of you is to bring his promise to
[1:45:17] pass so God said I'll send them the best
[1:45:20] thing that I can I'll send them my word
[1:45:23] you don't have to do it by your own
[1:45:24] might he showed you that you don't have
[1:45:26] to do it by your own might because he
[1:45:28] was standing there on the mountain and
[1:45:30] he didn't use any power and he didn't
[1:45:32] use any he didn't use any great strength
[1:45:34] he simply took it is written and he
[1:45:37] overcome the enemy right there what is
[1:45:39] it God is the god of the
[1:45:42] Paradox right here let us stand this
[1:45:48] morning amen
[1:45:56] he's that kind of a God that he can
[1:45:58] release his burden over you you might be
[1:46:01] carrying the burden and you might be
[1:46:02] carrying you might be weary you might be
[1:46:03] a weary
[1:46:05] traveler but the greatest way to let go
[1:46:08] of your burden is to find yourself in
[1:46:09] the promises of
[1:46:11] God say Lord I I need I need a touch
[1:46:14] from you today I need just more of you
[1:46:16] in my life as we go forward into the
[1:46:18] promises of God lord would would you
[1:46:20] help me Lord would you anoint My
[1:46:23] Faith Lord bless us as we go forward
[1:46:26] let's just bow our hearts today Heavenly
[1:46:28] Father we approach you father by the
[1:46:30] preaching of the word we recognize that
[1:46:33] we are here gathered here Lord these
[1:46:35] things have been heavy on my heart Lord
[1:46:37] today thinking over these things and we
[1:46:39] recognize that you're going to release
[1:46:41] your burden father you see people that
[1:46:43] are praying for certain needs and you
[1:46:45] see why you maybe why you keep them up
[1:46:47] or maybe why they're burden so much over
[1:46:49] this certain one it's because you have
[1:46:52] been dealing with us to pray for that
[1:46:53] certain need father now God we commit
[1:46:57] our faith unto you and ask that your
[1:46:59] blessings would be released in this
[1:47:01] place now God we take you at your word
[1:47:05] so let it be in Jesus Christ's name amen
[1:47:09] God bless you brother
