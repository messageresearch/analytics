[10:04] he? He will sing us on through the fire.
[10:08] He never promised that the cross will
[10:10] not be heavy.
[10:13] [Music]
[10:15] He never promised that the cross would
[10:19] not get heavy and the hill would not be
[10:24] hard to
[10:29] collide. And he never
[10:32] offered a victory without fighting. He
[10:36] said, "He'll put on some comfort
[10:43] time." Well, just remember when you're
[10:47] standing in the valley of
[10:51] decision and the
[10:54] adversary says, "Keep me.
[10:59] Just hold
[11:02] on cuz our Lord will
[11:06] show and he will take
[11:09] you finally.
[11:17] Many times of
[11:19] question certain
[11:23] circumstances on things I could not
[11:31] understand. Many times in
[11:35] trials my weakness blurs my
[11:38] vision and my
[11:41] frustration gets all out of pain.
[11:47] But it's then I am
[11:51] reminded I've never been
[11:54] forsaken. I've never had to stand the
[11:59] test,
[12:02] Lord.
[12:05] Only
[12:06] victory. The spirit rises up in me. And
[12:12] through the fight, my weakness is made
[12:19] strong. And he never promised that the
[12:24] cross would not get
[12:26] heavy and the hill would not be hard to
[12:32] collide.
[12:34] [Music]
[12:36] Oh, he never
[12:38] offered a victory without fighting. But
[12:43] he said help would always come in time.
[12:51] Just remember where you're
[12:54] standing in the valley of
[12:58] decision in the
[13:01] adversary says keep
[13:05] me just
[13:09] hold our Lord will
[13:13] show and he will take you all the
[13:18] singing he never promised.
[13:20] [Music]
[13:24] Oh, he never
[13:26] promised that the cross would not be
[13:30] heavy and the hill would not be hard to
[13:39] collide. Oh, he never on
[13:43] earth or dream without fighting. But he
[13:47] said help him would always come in time.
[13:56] Just remember when you're
[13:59] standing in the valley of
[14:03] decision in the
[14:05] adversary says
[14:09] give
[14:11] [Music]
[14:13] just cuz our Lord will show
[14:18] hope and he will take you to
[14:23] find him.

[14:28] through the fires of life? Amen. Let's
[14:31] sing a song. You are not a God created

[21:44] garment and he'll meet your need this

[21:55] a baby we had last night. Little Eat and
[21:58] Jane. We just give them all unto the
[22:00] Lord this morning, don't we? Amen. God
[22:03] bless
[22:05] you. Let's just bow our
[22:08] heads. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to
[22:11] just come and be here again once this
[22:12] morning. And Lord, what a what a greater
[22:15] place to be than here and here in your
[22:17] presence and here amongst believers and
[22:19] those of like minds and like faith,
[22:21] Lord. And I believe there's more than
[22:23] two or three gathered here in the
[22:24] building this morning. And Lord, all
[22:26] those prayer requests that would be
[22:27] brought. I just you hear the ones that
[22:29] are fighting cancer and sister Ber there
[22:32] and our pastor and those prayer requests
[22:34] that uh that we heard brought forth with
[22:36] the cancer with and Lord Jesus. I just
[22:39] believe that though it may be the spirit
[22:41] of the age, I also believe that there's
[22:42] a greater spirit here amongst us. And
[22:44] that spirit can come and touch each and
[22:46] every one of those. And Lord, we hear
[22:48] the sister there that's that's in
[22:50] Seattle and her aorta ripped and they
[22:52] give percentages and they give all those
[22:54] things. But I just believe that's just a
[22:56] testifying of of how great the miracle
[22:59] will be, Lord. And I just believe that
[23:01] you would just go and be there with her
[23:02] and be able to just touch each and every
[23:04] one of us that are here among the
[23:05] building. And Lord Jesus, I just pray
[23:07] that your spirit would just come and
[23:09] fall because we don't want to come and
[23:10] just have a gathering of people. We want
[23:12] to be able to come and worship you and
[23:14] be able to give you all the praise and
[23:15] glory that you are deserving of, Lord.
[23:17] And I just believe that after a service
[23:19] last night, as brother Andrew would just
[23:21] come and he would just preach and just
[23:23] be able to show that the seed must come
[23:25] forth and no matter what storms and
[23:27] trials we must come through. And Lord
[23:29] Jesus, we know that seeds are born
[23:31] through the fire and the the gold is
[23:33] tried by the fire, Lord. And I'm just
[23:35] believing this morning as we've have a
[23:36] we have a pastor that he's been tried
[23:38] once and tried again and Satan would
[23:40] come and he would just be able to just
[23:42] come and just try him by different
[23:44] sicknesses and different trials. Lord, I
[23:46] just believe that we'll be able to just
[23:48] catch that anointing and catch the
[23:49] inspiration this morning of the service
[23:51] and just be able to come and just allow
[23:53] us to move directly into your presence,
[23:55] Lord, and be with the be with our
[23:57] pastors as they would go and travel. I
[23:59] believe that you would just go with them
[24:00] and protect them in the travels and
[24:02] protect them and just be able to anoint
[24:04] them this week as brother Angel would be
[24:06] in New Zealand and brother Ron would be
[24:07] in Louisiana. Lord Jesus, I just pray
[24:09] that your spirit would just go with them
[24:11] and just be able to speak directly to
[24:13] the people. And Lord, we know there's
[24:15] only a few seeds left and once those
[24:17] seeds come, we could just go right home,
[24:19] Lord. And we know we are here for a time
[24:21] being and just a just a period of time.
[24:23] And Lord Jesus, I believe that that door
[24:25] is closing. And I just pray that we all
[24:27] could just come and have a greater walk
[24:29] with you after this morning. And Lord
[24:31] Jesus, we just thank you for what you're
[24:33] about to do. In Jesus name we pray.
[24:39] Amen. Amen. This morning, as we receive
[24:42] our tithes and offerings, we'll sing a
[24:44] song, He Abides, He Abides. We'll have
[24:46] Sister Sarah Robinson prepare to come
[24:48] sing for us this morning. And then the
[24:50] choir after uh after Sister Sarah this
[24:53] morning. Well, I'm rejoicing night and
[24:56] day as I walk that narrow way for the
[25:01] hand of God in all my life I
[25:05] see. Oh, and the reason of my bliss is
[25:10] the secret. All is this, that the
[25:14] comforter abides with
[25:18] me. Oh, he abides.
[25:21] [Music]
[25:23] He
[25:25] abide. Oh,
[25:27] halleluah. He abide with
[25:31] me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[25:37] walk that narrow way. For the comfort
[25:42] abides with
[25:44] me. Well, once my heart was full of sin.
[25:49] Once I had no peace with him till I
[25:53] heard how Jesus died on the
[25:58] tree. Oh then I fell down at his feet
[26:02] and there came a peace so sweet. Now the
[26:07] comforter abides with
[26:11] me. Well he
[26:13] [Music]
[26:15] abides. He abides.
[26:19] Oh
[26:20] hallelu, he abides with
[26:24] me. Will I rejoice in night and day as I
[26:30] walk that narrow way for the comforter
[26:35] abides with
[26:38] me. Oh, he is with me
[26:42] everywhere and he knows my every day.
[26:46] I'm as happy as an earth and just as
[26:51] free. Oh, for the spirit has control.
[26:56] Jesus satisfies my soul since the
[27:01] comfort abides with me. Aren't you glad
[27:05] that he
[27:09] abides? He
[27:11] [Music]
[27:12] abides. Hallelujah.
[27:15] be abides with
[27:19] me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[27:24] walk the narrow way. For the comfort
[27:29] abides with
[27:32] me. Oh, there's no thirsting for the
[27:36] things of the world. They've taken
[27:40] grace. Long ago I gave them up and
[27:46] instantly. Oh my life was turned today.
[27:51] All my burdens roll away. Now the cold
[27:56] murder ab by the way. Oh just sing it to
[28:00] him when he
[28:02] [Music]
[28:04] abide. He abide.
[28:07] [Music]
[28:09] Halleluah. He
[28:11] abides with
[28:13] me. Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day as I
[28:19] walk that narrow way for the comforter
[28:25] about
[28:28] me. Amen. You can be seated this
[28:31] morning.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:06] I was buried beneath my
[29:11] rebellion. Lost without hope of
[29:15] redemption. Blind to my need for a
[29:18] savior. Oh, but
[29:24] God crushed by the weight of my
[29:29] failure. Living the lie I
[29:33] created. Digging my grave without
[29:37] knowing. Oh, but God. Oh, but
[29:43] God rich in mercy. How you love me too
[29:49] much to let me stay
[29:52] lost. My
[29:55] salvation sent from heaven nailing my
[29:59] sin to a cross. Oh but
[30:05] God you gave me a truth worth believing.
[30:11] And I traded my chains for your
[30:15] freedom. Cuz you were the one that I
[30:19] needed. Oh
[30:24] God, resurrecting my heart from the
[30:29] rest. My rescue came through like the
[30:34] morning. Now this is my sure testimony.
[30:39] Oh God. Oh
[30:44] God. Rich in
[30:46] mercy. How you love me too much to let
[30:50] me stay
[30:53] lost. My
[30:55] salvation sent from heaven. Belling my
[31:00] sin to a cross. Oh you are rich in
[31:04] mercy.
[31:06] How you love me too much to let me stay
[31:12] lost. My
[31:14] salvation sent from heaven nailing my
[31:18] sin to a
[31:20] cross. Oh my God.
[31:27] Hold the
[31:30] wreckage of my
[31:35] choicees. You have turned to life from
[31:44] ashes.
[31:46] Lifted from death,
[31:51] risen with him. Now I stand
[31:58] in
[32:01] confidence. I know that all the
[32:07] rage of my
[32:11] choicees you have turned to life from

[32:48] salvation sent from heaven nailing my
[32:52] sin to a cross. Oh, you are rich in
[32:57] mercy. How you love me too much to let
[33:01] me stay

[34:30] Well, I've been turned around, but I've
[34:33] never been
[34:35] lost. See the water get
[34:38] trouble. But we walked
[34:41] across when my knees were
[34:45] shaking. You held my
[34:48] hand. Turning my
[34:51] problems to a promised
[34:55] land. Lead on good shepherd. I'll follow
[35:00] all my days.
[35:03] There ain't nothing sweeter than a watch
[35:06] you make
[35:08] way. You walk me through the valley, but
[35:12] you never steer me
[35:15] wrong. So lead on your shepherd
[35:20] lead. Seen some
[35:24] mighty that you brought me through.
[35:28] seen some mighty big
[35:30] mountains and they're just still been
[35:34] moved. Glory glory
[35:37] hallelujah. Yeah, that's my
[35:41] song. Walking with my
[35:43] father into the great
[35:48] alone. The good shepherd I'll follow all
[35:54] my days.
[35:56] There ain't nothing sweeter than to
[35:59] watch you fade
[36:01] away. You walk me through the valley,
[36:06] but you never steer me
[36:08] wrong. So lead on, good shepherd, lead
[36:15] on. Step by step, day by day. Lead me
[36:21] on, Lord I pray. Road gets dark. Walk by
[36:25] me. Lean on good
[36:29] shepherd. Set by step day by day. Lead
[36:34] me on Lord I pray. Broken star walk
[36:40] my good
[36:42] shepherd. We are good shepherd. I'll
[36:47] follow all my
[36:49] dreams. There ain't nothing sweeter than
[36:53] watch you make
[36:56] way. You walk me through the valley, but
[37:00] you never steer
[37:03] me. So wait on the shepherd lead
[37:10] on step by step, day by day. Lead me on
[37:16] Lord I pray. Rogue gets dark walk by
[37:20] faith. Lead on good
[37:23] shepherd. Step by step by day. Lead me
[37:29] on Lord I pray. Broken sto
[37:34] by the good
[37:37] shepherd. The good
[37:41] shepherd. Lead on good

[46:57] We recognize he's
[47:00] here. I don't know what your need is
[47:02] this
[47:03] [Music]
[47:04] morning. You know, we will go and spend
[47:07] hours and
[47:08] hours sitting in doctor's and specialist
[47:11] office,
[47:14] but five minutes in this presence.
[47:16] That's right. Come on. Can change your
[47:19] future.
[47:22] [Music]
[47:23] Maybe you've been sitting on a fence
[47:25] and, you know, just kind
[47:28] of not giving it your all.
[47:31] [Music]
[47:35] Won't you just let the Lord come by your
[47:37] way?
[47:40] And all you have to do is say, "Lord, I
[47:43] I surrender.
[47:48] I don't have a great
[47:50] speech. I don't have to spend 15 minutes
[47:53] in prayer. But
[47:55] Father, I surrender my all.
[48:02] He cares.
[48:05] We've got a God that cares.
[48:08] Won't you just let down that shell this
[48:10] morning and say,
[48:11] "Father, I need you.
[48:15] I need you like never before.
[48:22] Hallelujah.
[48:26] Heavenly Father, we bow our heads to
[48:29] [Music]
[48:31] you. What an awesome presence in this
[48:34] building
[48:38] today. Now, Lord, come by our way.
[48:46] come to my temple
[48:49] today. I want to say I
[48:53] surrender. I'm
[48:55] sorry. I'm sorry where I've disappointed
[49:00] you. I'm
[49:03] sorry for everything that I've ever done
[49:06] that would hurt you.
[49:09] Now Lord, we have great
[49:13] needs and you're a God that that there's
[49:17] nothing
[49:19] impossible. We think our mountains are
[49:22] too high to get
[49:24] over and the valleys are just too
[49:28] deep. The storm clouds are so
[49:31] hard. But God, I've met a God that walks
[49:34] on
[49:36] water. That's a light in the darkest
[49:40] place. Now, Lord, we surrender oursel to
[49:45] you. Now, Father, come by our
[49:49] pew because you
[49:52] care. We invite you just now. Anoint the
[49:56] speaker. Anoint the hearer.
[50:00] Lord
[50:02] God, thank you for coming.
[50:06] Thank
[50:07] you. Our prophet said, "You go where
[50:10] you're
[50:13] invited. I invite you to the throne room
[50:16] of my heart like never
[50:19] before. Touch our lives today. In Jesus
[50:23] Christ's name we pray." Amen. And amen
[50:26] and amen. Amen. Do you love him?
[50:30] Amen. Just need greet your neighbor
[50:32] right there where you are this morning.
[50:34] Good to be in the house of the Lord with
[50:36] you.
[50:37] And
[50:40] Amen.
[50:43] Amen.
[50:46] Amen. Amen. I'm looking for
[50:49] Tommy. Where is he? Oh, there he is.
[50:51] Yeah. I'm I got to meet with them just
[50:54] before service and
[50:57] I I've known I've known some of them
[51:00] since in the '9s and and uh so good to
[51:04] have family among us and so Amen. We so
[51:07] love you with all of our hearts and if I
[51:10] don't get to greet you personally I want
[51:11] to say hello and thank you for coming
[51:13] and each and every one of you. Once
[51:16] again, we're so happy to have Sister
[51:17] Tiffany with us and and uh that's
[51:20] brother Glenn Gruner's daughter and
[51:22] uh and we're so thrilled that she's
[51:25] here. She's a nurse and does a lot of
[51:28] great work. And so I have got great
[51:30] respect for nurses and so Amen. They do
[51:34] what doctors can't do and they can put
[51:37] that gentle touch just right. And so we
[51:40] thank her for being here. Amen. And so
[51:43] we we were I was listening to a service
[51:45] this morning. I kind of had my eyes
[51:47] closed and and I was just I was just
[51:50] meditating and and we've got some we've
[51:53] got some chairs there and I I study in a
[51:56] certain place and and I opened my eyes
[51:59] and she was sitting in a chair just over
[52:00] a place and just enjoying it and and I I
[52:04] thought this is really nice. And so I I
[52:07] just so thank you guys for everything
[52:09] that you do for us and thank you for
[52:11] your prayers this week. We we had more
[52:14] we had more uh to see the doctors and so
[52:18] you know it's a roller coaster
[52:20] experience and there's good days and
[52:21] there's bad days and just because you
[52:23] get a good test and just because you get
[52:25] a bad test, he's still God.
[52:28] He's still God and my peace is inside of
[52:31] him. And so Amen. And maybe those that
[52:34] are listening are fighting cancer and
[52:37] it's up and down experience. Well, you
[52:39] just rest a little bit. Yeah. And you
[52:42] just just have some peace. God's got it.
[52:45] God's got it. Doctors are only there to
[52:48] help us. There are the agents on the
[52:49] earth and and you know, take their
[52:51] medicine. And that might be kind of
[52:53] against your will, but you know, they're
[52:55] they're trying to help you out the best
[52:57] as you can. And and just remember,
[52:59] medicine is a chemical and you have a
[53:01] chemical body. And brother Brandham said
[53:04] it's worth about 84 cents. And you may
[53:07] put a $500 suit on it, but your body's
[53:09] worth about 84 cents. And so, Amen.
[53:12] Maybe you think you're something. I just
[53:14] blew your bubble for a little bit there.
[53:16] And so, I'm
[53:17] sorry. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[53:20] If you will turn with me to Matthew
[53:22] chapter 27 and verse 57.
[53:32] I want to speak for just a little bit
[53:34] this morning and
[53:37] um I want to speak on He went to hell
[53:42] for me. Amen.
[53:45] He went to hell for
[53:48] me. Amen.
[53:54] Matthew chap 27:E
[53:58] 57. And when the evening was come, there
[54:02] come a rich man of
[54:03] Armthea named
[54:05] Joseph, who also himself was Jesus's
[54:10] disciple. And he went to Pilate and
[54:13] begged the body of Jesus. And then
[54:16] Pilate commanded the body to be
[54:18] delivered.
[54:20] And when Joseph had taken the body, he
[54:22] wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and
[54:26] he laid it in his own new tomb, which he
[54:31] had hewned out in the
[54:33] rock. And he rolled a great stone to the
[54:37] door of the supplr, and
[54:39] departed. And there was Mary Magdalene
[54:42] and the other Mary sitting over against
[54:45] the
[54:46] supplr. Now the next day that followed
[54:48] the day of the preparation, the chief
[54:51] priest and the Pharisees came together
[54:54] unto P, and I've always marveled at
[54:56] these next couple of verses, saying,
[54:59] "Sir, we remember that that
[55:04] deceiver said while he was yet alive,
[55:07] after three days, I will rise again."
[55:12] Command therefore that the supplicer be
[55:15] made sure until the third day, lest the
[55:19] disciples come by night, and steal him
[55:21] away. And say unto the people, he is
[55:25] risen from the dead, so that the last
[55:28] era shall be worse than the first. And
[55:31] Pilate said unto them, you have a watch.
[55:35] Go your way. Make it as sure as you can.
[55:38] And they went and made their supplicer
[55:41] sure, sealing the stone and setting a
[55:45] watch. Stupid devil.
[55:49] You may be
[55:53] seated. Now, they didn't believe him in
[55:56] his
[55:57] doctrine, but they somehow believed him
[55:59] in his
[56:04] resurrection. That's quite a paradox,
[56:07] isn't it? They're afraid he really is
[56:09] going to come back to life. I got news
[56:11] for them. He did.
[56:16] He
[56:17] did. Brother Brandon would say it like
[56:20] this. He said, "Upon this rock, I'll
[56:22] build my
[56:23] church, and the gates of hell shall not
[56:26] prevail against it." It works perfect
[56:30] with Matthew
[56:31] 24 and St. John 5 and 24. He that
[56:35] heareth my words and believeth on them,
[56:37] and that has sent me has everlasting
[56:40] life, and shall never come into
[56:43] condemnation, but hath passed from death
[56:46] unto
[56:47] life. Not because you had any more move
[56:51] or any emotion, but because you have
[56:54] been the privilege of having Christ
[56:58] revealed to you from heaven. Amen. and
[57:01] upon this rock I'll build my
[57:05] church. And then Jacob when he
[57:09] died, his son had his body packed up and
[57:15] he was buried with Abraham, Isaac and
[57:19] Sarah and Job in the Holy Lands in
[57:24] Palestine. And then Joseph being a
[57:28] prophet, he prospered down in Egypt. He
[57:31] knew God and God had revealed himself to
[57:34] him and and when he
[57:37] died said, "Don't you bury my bones down
[57:41] here."
[57:43] But when someday God will surely visit
[57:45] you. Why? He rested solemnly upon the
[57:50] word of God to Moses. 400 years they'll
[57:55] serve this nation, but I'll bring them
[57:58] out.
[57:59] And I want you to just notice this next
[58:01] statement. He rested solemnly upon the
[58:06] word.
[58:09] That's our resting place today. Right
[58:13] now, brother Ram says, "I God is going
[58:16] to judge you for your attitude towards
[58:21] Christ." No. No
[58:23] man. Hell wasn't
[58:25] made. It wasn't made for Christians.
[58:31] Hell was made for unbelievers.
[58:35] And God has did everything that he can
[58:39] to keep people from to to bypass hell so
[58:44] that you won't have to go there.
[58:47] He sent a law. He sent prophets. He sent
[58:51] his son. He sent the Holy Spirit. He
[58:54] sent churches, hymns, everything
[59:01] to try to keep you from going to hell.
[59:08] Hell was not made for people. Hell was
[59:12] created for the devil and his angels,
[59:16] not for human beings.
[59:19] But if you go, it's because you
[59:21] willingly want to go.
[59:26] It's because you willingly
[59:29] want to go. And listen, if you're
[59:32] against God and against God's word, you
[59:35] become an enemy of God.
[59:39] Are you with me? Listen, I don't want to
[59:41] go.
[59:43] And he says, he says now, but he says,
[59:47] "But if you go, it's because you
[59:49] willingly want to go. And you can't go
[59:53] easy." I love this statement. You can't
[59:55] go easy. You will have to fight your
[59:59] way.
[1:00:03] You'll have to fight your way into it.
[1:00:06] Did you know that? You can't go to hell
[1:00:09] easily. You have to fight your way to
[1:00:13] it.
[1:00:16] Let me just say this to you. Hell was
[1:00:18] not made for believers.
[1:00:22] Thank you, Lord. I want you to know as a
[1:00:24] Christian here this day, as believers,
[1:00:27] you're as close to hell as you'll ever
[1:00:29] be.
[1:00:33] Listen, it's not a fictitious place.
[1:00:37] If you'll
[1:00:38] notice, hell was mentioned more by Jesus
[1:00:42] than heaven
[1:00:44] cuz he came to keep you from going
[1:00:47] there.
[1:00:51] We have an experience through brother
[1:00:52] Brandham when he was shot at 14 years
[1:00:54] old. And if you'll just give me a little
[1:00:56] time this morning, brother Brandham at
[1:01:00] 14 years old, he he slips into that
[1:01:03] dimension.
[1:01:04] I believe it just as much as I believe
[1:01:06] he was transported beyond the curtain of
[1:01:09] time.
[1:01:10] And he slips into that dimension. And
[1:01:12] I'm not going to tell every detail, but
[1:01:14] he begins to talk about the falling. And
[1:01:18] he said, "I was falling and I couldn't
[1:01:22] stop."
[1:01:25] Listen, that alone is enough. Right? But
[1:01:29] I was falling and falling and I had
[1:01:32] nothing that I could catch myself to and
[1:01:34] I was
[1:01:36] screaming. Came to a place to where that
[1:01:40] was a place of people moaning and and
[1:01:43] groaning and right let me just say this
[1:01:46] to you. There's no friends in hell.
[1:01:51] Oh, brother Ron, but we're going to
[1:01:52] party down there. Let me just say this
[1:01:54] to you. They will blame each other
[1:01:57] for being bringing them to a place of
[1:02:00] torment. Young people, let me just say,
[1:02:03] your friends that try to get you into
[1:02:05] drugs and alcohol and pornography and
[1:02:08] all different kind, they're not your
[1:02:09] friends.
[1:02:11] And we're headed in a complete different
[1:02:13] direction than they are. This is not our
[1:02:16] home.
[1:02:18] And we will never be comfortable here.
[1:02:27] Connie was were driving me through UVA
[1:02:30] the other day and seeing all the sites
[1:02:33] of of Sodom and Gomorrah and Leosa and
[1:02:36] she said it just makes me sick.
[1:02:40] And I told her, I said, "It's because
[1:02:42] the God that's on the inside of you.
[1:02:47] It makes God sick. So it's going to make
[1:02:51] you sick.
[1:02:53] Listen folks, this is not our home.
[1:02:58] This is a temporary place where we build
[1:03:01] character and know Christ as our savior.
[1:03:10] Brother Brandham, and I'm just going to
[1:03:12] jump. Brother Brandham was sitting in JC
[1:03:14] Penney and he's speaking souls now in
[1:03:18] prison.
[1:03:19] Now, he walks with
[1:03:21] angels and with some of the greatest
[1:03:24] people on the
[1:03:25] earth, but he recognizes like we're in
[1:03:28] two dimensions. And you say, "Well, that
[1:03:30] was just Brother Brandma."
[1:03:34] Really? You slip into these
[1:03:36] services and you feel what you feel even
[1:03:39] now. That's right. And you
[1:03:42] realize this is a lot different than
[1:03:45] what I feel on my job.
[1:03:48] This is a lot different than what I feel
[1:03:50] out in the world. It's because you're
[1:03:53] being pulled in a direction.
[1:03:58] Are you with me? You're influenced from
[1:04:00] above.
[1:04:02] Brother Brandham is in JC Penney and
[1:04:04] he's doing what a lot of us men do when
[1:04:07] our wives are shopping. he was
[1:04:11] sitting. And so he's he's watching
[1:04:13] people come up on an escalator and he's
[1:04:16] watching and all of a sudden what he saw
[1:04:19] in hell he sees before him
[1:04:23] and women coming up with their hairdos
[1:04:26] and the the stuff on their face and all
[1:04:29] of that different kind of thing. He sees
[1:04:30] that same image
[1:04:33] that he saw there. That's
[1:04:35] right. And you might say, "Well, that's
[1:04:38] that's really difficult for me to
[1:04:40] believe that that what he saw in hell,
[1:04:44] that's what he's seeing here." Let me
[1:04:45] just say, you're being pulled in one
[1:04:47] direction or another.
[1:04:52] And you're going to fight your way to go
[1:04:54] to hell. That's right. You're going to
[1:04:56] fight your way to go there. Now,
[1:05:00] listen. in the Old Testament when when
[1:05:03] they would
[1:05:05] die and believers,
[1:05:08] prophets, great patriarchs of the
[1:05:11] ages, they were under the blood of bulls
[1:05:15] and goats.
[1:05:17] And under that blood of bulls and goats,
[1:05:20] they couldn't go into the heavenly
[1:05:22] dimension because it took the blood of
[1:05:25] Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] to release that realm to where that they
[1:05:30] would be held. That's right. Now listen,
[1:05:32] the was these was phenomenal individuals
[1:05:36] that had had phenomenal experiences with
[1:05:39] God himself. Abraham sitting with him
[1:05:42] under an oak tree and Sarah being
[1:05:46] changed. Ezekiel seeing him as a will
[1:05:49] within the middle of the wheel. Job
[1:05:52] seeing him and knowing he didn't
[1:05:54] understand death. And God revealed to
[1:05:57] him that in his flesh, he'll see God.
[1:06:04] And when it came their time to die,
[1:06:06] living under that blood of bulls and
[1:06:08] goats, and they believe the serpent on
[1:06:11] the pole, but it come a time to where
[1:06:13] that they would slip.
[1:06:17] And there's just no better way of
[1:06:18] putting it. It comes a time where your
[1:06:21] body cannot sustain life.
[1:06:25] Right. That's right. And your body can't
[1:06:27] hold it. And so these
[1:06:30] patriarchs, listen, they didn't have a
[1:06:34] revelation of Malachi 45 and six like
[1:06:37] you have under the seals to understand
[1:06:40] what death is, right? They didn't
[1:06:43] understand it. They
[1:06:45] couldn't. And let me just say it as a
[1:06:48] real believer, we can step forward like
[1:06:51] my mother did and say, "I'm ready to
[1:06:54] go." Right. And when she said, "When I'm
[1:06:57] ready to go," she just slipped in
[1:06:59] because she'd believed this message all
[1:07:00] of her life.
[1:07:03] And she knew when her heart quit beating
[1:07:05] here, her last breath here was her first
[1:07:09] breath there.
[1:07:12] And she was in perfect peace.
[1:07:17] Can you imagine the fellowship of
[1:07:19] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Ezekiel,
[1:07:21] and Nahome, and the prophets David, and
[1:07:24] Solomon, and all of those men in that
[1:07:26] dimension knowing him and with an
[1:07:31] expectation, he's coming.
[1:07:41] Brother Brandham said, "When Adam's
[1:07:43] raised, the children of Adam
[1:07:46] was all backed into a
[1:07:48] corner. Death and sickness on every
[1:07:51] hand. Sin crowding in. The law had
[1:07:57] failed. The prophets had
[1:08:00] failed. Everything had
[1:08:03] failed. And they had refused. And and
[1:08:06] they were in such a muddle.
[1:08:10] diseases and ignorance and so forth had
[1:08:14] just collapsed them into a place that
[1:08:17] there was just no hopes
[1:08:19] left. And there stood Adam's race
[1:08:23] quivering and shaking and nothing could
[1:08:27] be done. Hell was opening up her bosom
[1:08:31] to swallow them up. And in glory,
[1:08:35] someone stepped out. the son of
[1:08:38] God. I'll go down farther. I'll become
[1:08:42] one of them.
[1:08:44] I'm gonna try to behave all I can.
[1:08:48] And the angel said, "What will you do?"
[1:08:51] And he said, "Watch."
[1:08:55] One day, standing yonder amongst the
[1:08:57] sons of men, he looked down through the
[1:09:00] greatest dread that man ever had, which
[1:09:03] was death. and he raised his arms and he
[1:09:06] went to a place called Calvary and he
[1:09:09] plunged himself into the darkest mist
[1:09:13] that man ever
[1:09:16] feared, which was
[1:09:18] death and conquered it.
[1:09:22] Don't let those words just be words of
[1:09:25] poetry.
[1:09:27] Don't let it be words of conquering.
[1:09:32] It was your greatest enemy.
[1:09:39] We celebrate next week as Easter.
[1:09:46] Without Easter, we're all lost.
[1:09:53] Without Easter.
[1:09:57] We die without Christ.
[1:10:00] We live our years out. Some at
[1:10:05] birth, some at a teenage
[1:10:09] years, some in their 20s and 30s, some
[1:10:13] in their
[1:10:14] 90s. But without Christ, Brother Jason,
[1:10:18] we die like a dog.
[1:10:21] That's right. We die like a dog. It's
[1:10:24] just over, right?
[1:10:33] Satan had made
[1:10:35] plans to destroy the human
[1:10:38] race. Last night I sat where you sat,
[1:10:41] Andrew, and I realized I was sitting in
[1:10:44] one of the greatest services that had
[1:10:46] ever been in
[1:10:52] because the presence, not because of
[1:10:54] him.
[1:10:56] Because I recognized the presence of God
[1:10:59] that was in this building. And if you
[1:11:02] can recognize every one of you are at
[1:11:05] war,
[1:11:08] That's right.
[1:11:10] Every one of us are at war, right? And
[1:11:13] every kind of spirit is trying to keep
[1:11:15] you. Listen, Satan is smart enough to
[1:11:18] realize, he reads the book, he's smart
[1:11:20] enough to realize, I don't have much
[1:11:23] time left. That's right.
[1:11:26] He's got the drunkard. He's got the dope
[1:11:28] addicts. He's got false preachers.
[1:11:31] He's got them. But it's you.
[1:11:35] What does he want about you? Not your
[1:11:37] red hair, not your gray hair, not your
[1:11:39] build. He wants your position.
[1:11:52] Brother Meadows, I so love
[1:11:57] you. He said they call it a
[1:12:00] theophony that when we leave here, we go
[1:12:03] somewhere
[1:12:04] else, whatever it might be. I I take the
[1:12:07] apostles
[1:12:09] words when he said, "If this earthly
[1:12:13] tabernacle or dwelling place be
[1:12:17] dissolved, we have one already waiting.
[1:12:26] It's real near you. It's real near
[1:12:31] you to move from this into that.
[1:12:36] Now watch this. Don't let this be
[1:12:38] redundant. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[1:12:41] and Job, and all the prophets, they
[1:12:44] trusted and believing that there was
[1:12:46] coming a resurrection, that the redeemer
[1:12:49] was coming. They prophesied of him.
[1:12:53] Enoch prophesied of
[1:12:55] him, rested solemnly, sealed his
[1:12:58] testimony with it. Isaac and Jacob and
[1:13:02] Daniel and Jeremiah and E Ezekiel, they
[1:13:05] rested solemnly upon the time that the
[1:13:08] Messiah would come and they died with
[1:13:11] their souls and went into paradise and
[1:13:14] they could not go in that presence of
[1:13:16] God
[1:13:17] because he said that the blood of bulls
[1:13:20] and goats could not forgive sins. It
[1:13:22] only covered sins. Speaking of a day
[1:13:25] that when this perfect sacrifice song
[1:13:28] was sung just a moment ago, the lamb
[1:13:30] caused the blood in the animal could not
[1:13:33] come back to the worshipper. He said,
[1:13:36] "For when he would have not ceased to
[1:13:40] offer sacrifices of that
[1:13:42] type, but when the son of God died, the
[1:13:47] life that was in him was none other than
[1:13:50] but God." Amen. to come back and adopt
[1:13:54] us into the heavenly family of God. This
[1:13:58] next words, "And now we are the children
[1:14:02] of God."
[1:14:05] The life of the blood,
[1:14:09] the life of his
[1:14:12] blood. I and I don't mean to jump here
[1:14:15] just for a moment, but let me do this.
[1:14:18] in in John chapter 18 and verse
[1:14:21] 36. And Jesus
[1:14:23] answered, "My
[1:14:25] kingdom is not of this
[1:14:28] world. And if my kingdom were of this
[1:14:32] world, then would my servants fight that
[1:14:36] I not should not be delivered to the
[1:14:39] Jews. But now is my kingdom not from
[1:14:42] hence." And Pilate therefore said unto
[1:14:46] him, Art thou a king
[1:14:48] then? And Jesus answered said, "Thou
[1:14:52] sayest, that I am a king, and to this
[1:14:56] end was I born, and for this cause,"
[1:15:00] notice these words, "and for this cause
[1:15:03] came I into the world, that I should
[1:15:06] bear witness unto the truth, and
[1:15:08] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[1:15:12] voice." Amen.
[1:15:18] I want to just stop you just for a
[1:15:19] moment. It's no small thing you're here
[1:15:28] cuz you didn't put yourself here.
[1:15:33] But God rich in mercy
[1:15:36] watched over your life.
[1:15:40] I want you to just, you don't need to
[1:15:42] dig back too far, but you knew that you
[1:15:46] were making the wrong choices.
[1:15:50] Brother Ron, but I chose God. No,
[1:15:55] your choices were taking you away from
[1:15:57] God. God chose you.
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:02] You wasn't looking for God. God came
[1:16:06] looking for you.
[1:16:10] Hallelujah.
[1:16:13] Hallelujah. God,
[1:16:18] don't let this be a small thing.
[1:16:22] Don't let it be a small thing. God who
[1:16:25] created the heavens and the earth.
[1:16:29] God who created it all.
[1:16:34] God who spoke it into
[1:16:36] existence had you on his mind before any
[1:16:40] of that.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah.
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] Hallelujah.
[1:17:00] We think it's some humrum thing that we
[1:17:03] Okay, we're going to church on Saturday
[1:17:05] night. Okay, we're going
[1:17:09] to Don't you never take it common.
[1:17:15] Don't you never think take it as just
[1:17:16] something to do. This isn't going to
[1:17:19] Walmart.
[1:17:22] This is hearing from your heavenly home.
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:29] That's right.
[1:17:35] I'll just give you a little
[1:17:39] thought. In every
[1:17:42] service, and I'm talking about every
[1:17:45] service, I pray,
[1:17:47] "God, you're a big God. I want you to
[1:17:50] speak one sentence in this sermon to me.
[1:18:00] Why not the whole thing?
[1:18:02] Why not the whole thing? Brother Ron,
[1:18:04] let me just say when he says that one
[1:18:06] sentence to me and I know that that's my
[1:18:10] I am that I am.
[1:18:13] Yes, I want you to write the book.
[1:18:18] I She's been waiting on my permission
[1:18:21] for a long time and she knows what I'm
[1:18:23] talking about. So there's your one
[1:18:27] sentence. But when God speaks to
[1:18:33] you, Mr.
[1:18:39] Mitchell, you're not from
[1:18:42] here, West Virginia.
[1:18:45] You have a tumor on your lung. It's a
[1:18:49] death
[1:18:50] sentence. Listen, he had sat through an
[1:18:52] entire sermon, but now that sentence is
[1:18:56] him.
[1:19:01] I got to send a video yesterday of day
[1:19:04] before yesterday of brother Brady.
[1:19:07] Brother Brady has dementia now. Don't
[1:19:10] know who he is.
[1:19:12] And the pastor that is there was a young
[1:19:14] man in the church and raised up
[1:19:16] phenomenal young man.
[1:19:20] And I'd like to go
[1:19:22] back one more
[1:19:25] time.
[1:19:28] And brother Ron, you'll never do that.
[1:19:31] Don't tell me what I won't do.
[1:19:45] They've told me not to travel and I'm
[1:19:46] going to Switzerland in October.
[1:19:51] Hallelujah.
[1:19:53] I'm going to heaven soon.
[1:19:57] One sentence.
[1:19:59] One sentence. That's all that's
[1:20:01] required.
[1:20:04] That's what we look for because it
[1:20:07] speaks life.
[1:20:10] Are you with
[1:20:11] me? He spoke last night about
[1:20:14] seed. You didn't put the seed there. And
[1:20:18] neither does a preacher put the seed
[1:20:20] there. That's right. That was in you
[1:20:23] before the foundation of the world.
[1:20:26] That's right. But you get under the
[1:20:28] right atmosphere and it comes to life.
[1:20:32] And it's not you living anymore, but
[1:20:35] it's him living. You say, "But brother
[1:20:37] Ron, I've tried over and over and over
[1:20:39] and over and over again, and I keep
[1:20:41] falling. Get up."
[1:20:51] He said, "We see him in his earthly
[1:20:53] ministry as a
[1:20:55] conqueror, but now let's watch him after
[1:20:58] he died.
[1:21:03] He still went on conquering.
[1:21:07] I love that quote. He still went on
[1:21:10] conquering.
[1:21:13] He never ended that at the
[1:21:15] grave. The Bible said his soul descended
[1:21:18] into hell. and he preached to the souls
[1:21:21] that were in prison that repented not in
[1:21:25] the
[1:21:27] longsuffering of the days of Noah. I
[1:21:31] want to back up just a moment. He's
[1:21:33] hanging on a cross and listen, we can
[1:21:37] not even Hollywood could set the scenes
[1:21:41] of the atmosphere wrestling and
[1:21:44] fighting.
[1:21:46] Listen, the real believers were on the
[1:21:49] ground horrified.
[1:21:53] They were horrified. They had saw the
[1:21:55] phenomenal miracles that had taken
[1:21:57] place. Listen, they had saw him come
[1:22:00] walking on the water. They never had
[1:22:04] expectations of him being beaten until
[1:22:07] he was unrecognizable as a human being.
[1:22:10] Right.
[1:22:13] Right. to where his organs would show
[1:22:16] through his
[1:22:17] ribs
[1:22:19] pumping. Brother Brandham would so
[1:22:21] vividly explain
[1:22:23] that little dots becoming bigger
[1:22:29] dots. And then Pilate would stand there
[1:22:32] before him and say, "I find no
[1:22:39] fault in him."
[1:22:42] Now, here's something that you may find
[1:22:44] astonishing because with your ears, you
[1:22:48] hear your critics.
[1:22:52] You hear your critics so bash
[1:22:56] you. They're anointed of hell to do
[1:22:59] that.
[1:23:01] They're anointed of another realm to
[1:23:04] bash you. But I'll tell you what they're
[1:23:06] doing to you. Bringing you closer to
[1:23:09] Christ.
[1:23:21] Simon is asked to take and pick up his
[1:23:24] cross and carry
[1:23:27] it. Listen, God placed him there.
[1:23:32] God's not a racial God. God placed him
[1:23:36] there.
[1:23:38] God placed him there.
[1:23:41] his boys would be recognized in the book
[1:23:43] of
[1:23:45] Acts. God placed him there to pick up
[1:23:48] that cross when he was asked to do it.
[1:23:51] It's not some just by occasion. God had
[1:23:55] him.
[1:23:58] And he's carrying the cross with Jesus
[1:24:00] because now he's too weak to carry his
[1:24:02] own cross. Brother Brandon would explain
[1:24:04] the spit that was
[1:24:07] running off of his beard and they were
[1:24:11] spitting on him and they were cursing
[1:24:13] him. None of us have had a day like
[1:24:15] that.
[1:24:17] Don't tell me about how hard your life
[1:24:19] is. None of us have had a day like he is
[1:24:23] going through.
[1:24:24] But it didn't stop him.
[1:24:28] It didn't stop him because he'd already
[1:24:32] died to his own will in the garden of
[1:24:35] Gethsemane
[1:24:42] and he's hanging between heaven and
[1:24:46] earth. They lift
[1:24:49] him. Listen, the word says it, "Cursed
[1:24:52] is he that hangs on a tree."
[1:24:57] Listen, the only sinless man
[1:25:02] went to the lowest people of the
[1:25:06] cities became a footwash
[1:25:09] flunky, the lowest individual, and he
[1:25:13] preached to the lowest people.
[1:25:16] He didn't preach to dignitaries, right?
[1:25:19] stuff collars
[1:25:22] to try to win them.
[1:25:24] He preached to them, but they didn't
[1:25:26] want to hear it.
[1:25:34] And now he's hanging between two
[1:25:40] thieves. Let's just say it like it is.
[1:25:43] They deserve to be there, right? That's
[1:25:46] right. They deserve to be there. They've
[1:25:50] done a lot of bad things to be there.
[1:25:52] That's not our topic this morning. And
[1:25:54] let me just say this to you. Had they
[1:25:56] been given the opportunity, I want you
[1:25:58] to just hang on to this statement just
[1:26:00] for a moment. If they'd have been given
[1:26:02] opportunity to go down off of the cross
[1:26:04] and go live a life, they would have
[1:26:06] repeated the process.
[1:26:11] They'd have repeated the process. You
[1:26:14] can walk to an altar and if you don't
[1:26:16] really surrender, you'll repeat the
[1:26:18] process.
[1:26:20] God can forgive you of your sins and do
[1:26:22] his best for you, but you've got to
[1:26:24] totally surrender.
[1:26:26] You got to do it or you'll repeat the
[1:26:28] process over and over and over again.
[1:26:32] One begins to make
[1:26:35] fun and the other one begins to rebuke
[1:26:38] him and try to stop him.
[1:26:42] Stop it. He's done
[1:26:49] nothing. And he begins to talk to
[1:26:53] him and he ask him a question that I
[1:26:57] think is so
[1:27:00] phenomenal. Remember
[1:27:07] me. I would say we have a pretty good
[1:27:10] guess here. He never saw a
[1:27:14] miracle. He never heard a
[1:27:19] sermon. Never saw water turned to
[1:27:23] wine. He never saw the worst of people
[1:27:27] become
[1:27:32] pillars. But he recognizes a presence.
[1:27:43] I hope that when you come to this
[1:27:45] church, you recognize a presence.
[1:27:52] You may have went to churches that were
[1:27:53] dead as 4:00. I don't want this church
[1:27:56] to be like that.
[1:27:59] I want every time that we walk into this
[1:28:01] church, there's no nights off. That's
[1:28:03] right. There's no services off. Every
[1:28:07] service should be like a convention.
[1:28:11] It should be an expectation from us. I
[1:28:14] came to have a meeting with God.
[1:28:34] Lord remember me.
[1:28:40] Jesus's last earthly
[1:28:44] convert cost him the most.
[1:28:51] His last on
[1:28:53] earth cost him the
[1:28:57] most. Brother Ron, I need you to explain
[1:28:59] that. Okay.
[1:29:03] He went to Simon's
[1:29:05] house to get a woman. Not to impress
[1:29:10] Simon, not to impress the affiliates of
[1:29:12] the of the city, but to get a woman that
[1:29:15] would wash his feet.
[1:29:19] He went to a
[1:29:21] well to get a woman
[1:29:25] that was not welcomed in any church.
[1:29:32] And he went and sat on that well and
[1:29:34] even had to send his disciples away to
[1:29:37] get her.
[1:29:39] Now follow me. He had to go to a cross.
[1:29:42] That's right.
[1:29:45] Not just to redeem those that were
[1:29:47] before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all
[1:29:50] of those or me and you sitting here
[1:29:53] tonight, but in his fleshly journey
[1:29:57] in that body that no doubt never weighed
[1:30:00] over 150 lbs that looked older than what
[1:30:03] he was
[1:30:05] to get a thief.
[1:30:10] God will go where his seed is at.
[1:30:18] He's not ashamed of your dirt.
[1:30:21] Cuz underneath all of your dirt is a
[1:30:24] diamond.
[1:30:30] Under all your dirt is a
[1:30:34] diamond. Amen.
[1:30:41] When he breathes his last
[1:30:43] breaths, he speaks in another
[1:30:50] language. And those priests make fun of
[1:30:54] him. They make fun of him. And even
[1:30:58] then they begin to say, "If you are the
[1:31:01] Christ, come down." Brother Brandon
[1:31:04] would say at that
[1:31:05] point the greatest compliment that they
[1:31:08] could have made.
[1:31:15] Listen, even the devil knows who he is.
[1:31:20] And even the devil knows who you are.
[1:31:24] How, brother Ron? He watches the light,
[1:31:26] right?
[1:31:28] Cuz you're you're light in a very dark
[1:31:30] place, right? And listen, he don't have
[1:31:33] to have discernment to know. He watches
[1:31:36] the light.
[1:31:41] Now all he did from that that moment, he
[1:31:44] says,
[1:31:47] "Father, forgive them.
[1:31:50] They know not what they do." You say,
[1:31:53] "Brother Ron, what do I do with my
[1:31:54] enemy? Fight them?" No, you'll do no
[1:31:58] good. You'll just waste your energy.
[1:32:01] Without Christ, they're not going to
[1:32:02] change anyway.
[1:32:04] What do you do with your enemy? Forgive
[1:32:07] them. That's right.
[1:32:09] When they rail and accuse you and do all
[1:32:12] different kinds of things, don't it make
[1:32:15] you mad? Sure, my flesh. But listen, I
[1:32:18] don't operate from here. I have to
[1:32:20] operate from another dimension. Father,
[1:32:23] forgive them.
[1:32:25] That's good. What does that do? It
[1:32:28] releases the anger.
[1:32:33] I can't stay there long, but you get the
[1:32:35] point. Brother will use some of these
[1:32:39] thoughts that I'm getting to you. You
[1:32:41] might want to go back and listen to
[1:32:42] souls now in prison, kinsman, redeemer,
[1:32:46] inunement. He cares for
[1:32:52] you. Now what brother Brandham went
[1:32:54] through
[1:32:56] falling your savior went
[1:33:02] through if I can say it the easiest way
[1:33:05] is God went to hell for you.
[1:33:13] He took your place
[1:33:15] because all of you had the
[1:33:18] DNA under Adam's fall.
[1:33:23] When you get born, that baby that Connie
[1:33:26] just held this morning early, Miss Eden
[1:33:29] Jane, that baby that looks so
[1:33:33] innocent that I prayed for that God
[1:33:36] would give her an angel spirit, that
[1:33:38] baby will have to be born again.
[1:33:44] You won't teach her to
[1:33:46] lie. You won't teach her to do things
[1:33:48] that she really shouldn't do.
[1:33:51] You won't teach her to break your
[1:33:55] heart. You don't teach her. It's the
[1:33:58] Adamic nature.
[1:34:00] But when God comes in,
[1:34:03] he separates us from all of that. And
[1:34:06] that nature dies. And God gives you a
[1:34:09] new spirit. And he gives you a
[1:34:12] he gives you the Holy Ghost. And he
[1:34:15] seals you that the devil can't even get
[1:34:18] back to you.
[1:34:20] [Applause]
[1:34:35] Without saying it, God sent his own son
[1:34:39] to hell for me and you.
[1:34:45] The only way you and I can be redeemed
[1:34:47] is Jesus Christ.
[1:34:50] Well, science says they don't even know
[1:34:52] who that he ever
[1:34:55] came. Science also said if you go past
[1:34:58] 30 miles an hour, you'll fly off into
[1:35:00] space.
[1:35:04] Science says that Noah's arc never
[1:35:07] happened. Right?
[1:35:11] Science says a whole lot of things, but
[1:35:13] I'll tell you what God said. Come on.
[1:35:17] God's ambition was to keep you and I
[1:35:21] from going to that place.
[1:35:28] Now, when he gets
[1:35:30] there, he's not just laying on a rock.
[1:35:34] When he gets there, he begins to preach.
[1:35:39] He preached to the souls
[1:35:42] that heard Noah's message and rejected
[1:35:45] it.
[1:35:48] Why, brother Ron? Noah was prophesying
[1:35:51] of him to come. Right. And he was in
[1:35:54] hell proving that Noah was right. That's
[1:35:58] right.
[1:36:00] I am him.
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:03] I am him. that Jacob talked about. I am
[1:36:07] him that David talked about. I am him.
[1:36:12] Come on.
[1:36:14] Come on, church. I am him.
[1:36:24] I am not just one of the boys. I'm not
[1:36:27] just one of the prophets. I'm not just a
[1:36:30] great man.
[1:36:32] I am the kenchman redeemer.
[1:36:38] I am God
[1:36:41] in flesh.
[1:36:51] Brother Brandham said he walked up to
[1:36:53] the door of
[1:36:56] hell. You heard it last week. You heard
[1:37:00] it last week.
[1:37:01] Brother Matt when he finished up I
[1:37:05] thought I thought the whole weekend last
[1:37:06] week with brother Matt was so
[1:37:08] phenomenal.
[1:37:11] And he began to preach on standing up to
[1:37:13] a bully. I know our memor is not very
[1:37:16] good but if you remember the weekend
[1:37:17] before I preached on God standing with
[1:37:20] you. That's right. And then Matt is
[1:37:23] finishes his sermon on Sunday and I
[1:37:26] thought it was phenomenal.
[1:37:28] And he begins to preach on Jesus in
[1:37:30] hell. And I was sitting there and I
[1:37:33] turned to you and I said, "That's what
[1:37:35] I'm preaching next
[1:37:46] week. God's wanting to tell you, I went
[1:37:49] to hell for you. This is no small thing.
[1:37:59] You're not saved by any of your
[1:38:00] righteousness.
[1:38:02] You're not saved by any of your good
[1:38:04] deeds. Those things only express the
[1:38:07] presence of God that's inside of you.
[1:38:10] You're saved by the blood of Jesus
[1:38:13] Christ.
[1:38:18] Brother Brandon will tell it in several
[1:38:19] different places. He knocks on the door
[1:38:22] of hell. And I like what Matt did. He
[1:38:24] said he didn't just knock or some
[1:38:28] but it knocks on hell
[1:38:32] and Satan comes to the
[1:38:35] door. Now I I want to preface something
[1:38:38] right
[1:38:40] here. I believe that our prophet had
[1:38:45] access. How did he know that Eve had
[1:38:48] blonde hair?
[1:38:54] How did he know that she had blonde
[1:38:57] hair? How was he able to express what
[1:39:02] Adam looked like and his
[1:39:06] shoulders and what happened as they
[1:39:08] walked out of the garden? Brother
[1:39:10] Brandon will preach it and then a couple
[1:39:12] of services later said, "I watched Adam
[1:39:15] and Eve walk out of the garden." That's
[1:39:17] right. RCA and all of those places were
[1:39:20] not the first video.
[1:39:23] That's right. Come on. I'm not going out
[1:39:27] on a limb. He's not making these things
[1:39:29] up.
[1:39:32] Hallelujah. I believe the angel of God
[1:39:34] showed him for specific purposes. I'm
[1:39:37] going to have a bride that needs these
[1:39:39] things for sure that they can rest on
[1:39:41] the solemn promises.
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:47] Brother Ron, you're stretching. Oh, am I
[1:39:52] He's got a patient standing in front of
[1:39:54] him. And he's got a patient standing in
[1:39:57] and he goes back 40 years
[1:40:00] and explains what happens to a a dog
[1:40:04] getting off of a bus and a dog chasing
[1:40:07] them.
[1:40:10] And then he goes forward and shows that
[1:40:12] they're healed.
[1:40:15] standing in two dimensions at the same
[1:40:17] time. Need more proof? Brother Brown is
[1:40:20] standing in Mexico and a woman's
[1:40:22] carrying a dead baby.
[1:40:28] And brother Brown, I'm not going to tell
[1:40:29] you the story, but Brother Brandham
[1:40:31] after a vision says, "Bring her to me."
[1:40:33] It wasn't an if,
[1:40:37] folks. This is not an if.
[1:40:49] It wasn't an if. He knew that baby was
[1:40:52] coming back to
[1:40:57] life. And I want to say this to you.
[1:41:00] Some of you been here for decades, but
[1:41:02] you're still resting on the silent
[1:41:04] promises of the word of God. Don't let
[1:41:07] your faith get shifted every with
[1:41:09] different directions.
[1:41:13] I felt that. So, I'm going to take care
[1:41:14] of it. Abraham waited for decades.
[1:41:25] Decades. And his faith never wavered.
[1:41:31] Some of us are going to have that same
[1:41:33] testimony. I've been here for decades.
[1:41:36] 60 years after the prophet is dead. I'm
[1:41:39] still believing this message
[1:41:42] even more than I did. Yes, sir. I'm as
[1:41:46] enthusiastic about this message as I
[1:41:48] ever have been.
[1:42:03] And I'll tell you where my heart is. I
[1:42:05] may die in this earthly body, but it
[1:42:08] won't be of cancer.
[1:42:09] [Music]
[1:42:27] He
[1:42:28] knocks. Lord, help me. He knocks on the
[1:42:33] door of hell.
[1:42:40] Andrew, I'm gonna give you a piece of
[1:42:42] what I'm going to preach next Saturday
[1:42:46] night. You're what shows you how good
[1:42:50] you
[1:42:51] are is that you have a worthy oppon
[1:42:55] opponent.
[1:43:00] And the scripture says that he created
[1:43:03] his enemy.
[1:43:07] He created a worthy opponent.
[1:43:12] You say, "Well, Brother Ron, the the
[1:43:14] opponent that I have to fight is so
[1:43:16] strong and so
[1:43:18] horrible." God didn't give you a
[1:43:21] devil. Come on.
[1:43:24] Come on. He knew how powerful that you
[1:43:26] would be. That you would be the
[1:43:28] overcomer of this
[1:43:33] age. And he didn't give you a
[1:43:36] devil to fight against to prove who you
[1:43:39] are.
[1:43:40] [Applause]
[1:43:53] The devil tells him, he said, "I thought
[1:43:56] I had
[1:43:57] you when I got the prophets. I thought I
[1:44:01] had you when I got Abraham and got Isaac
[1:44:04] and I got Jacob. I thought I had you,
[1:44:06] but now I've got you."
[1:44:10] He thought, right?
[1:44:15] But this opponent that Satan's standing
[1:44:17] in front of is the same one that whipped
[1:44:20] him in the heavens. That's right.
[1:44:25] He's the same one that whipped him in
[1:44:28] the heavens and cast him into earth.
[1:44:32] Listen folks, you are fighting a
[1:44:35] defeated enemy.
[1:44:46] Brother Brandon said he reached over and
[1:44:49] grabbed the
[1:44:51] keys. He grabbed the keys off of Satan
[1:44:55] and pulled them out and took the keys of
[1:44:59] the trinity of hell.
[1:45:03] Death,
[1:45:04] hell, and the grave.
[1:45:08] So death can't hold you and you're not
[1:45:11] going to hell and the grave can't hold
[1:45:27] you. Now listen, where's those keys at,
[1:45:31] brother
[1:45:31] Ron? What do you do? Go hang them on a
[1:45:35] nail? No.
[1:45:38] No, he gave the
[1:45:41] keys to Peter.
[1:45:46] Who do men say that I, the son of man
[1:45:48] am?
[1:45:50] Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:45:52] living God.
[1:45:54] Peter, flesh and blood, hath not
[1:45:56] revealed this unto you, but unto my
[1:45:58] father which is in heaven. And he gave
[1:46:01] him the keys of revelation to know who
[1:46:04] Jesus Christ is.
[1:46:08] And if you properly know who Jesus
[1:46:10] Christ is, then you know who you are.
[1:46:14] [Applause]
[1:46:25] Brother Doug, how important is that to
[1:46:27] know who you are?
[1:46:30] I want to ask
[1:46:32] you, this is important part right here.
[1:46:35] How important is it for you to know who
[1:46:39] you are?
[1:46:42] I want you to look at your neighbor and
[1:46:44] I want you to tell them how important it
[1:46:46] is for you to know know, not think, but
[1:46:52] to know who you are.
[1:47:01] You're not going to like this devil.
[1:47:03] You're not going to like this part.
[1:47:09] Not think who you are or read a book and
[1:47:13] know who you are, but when you know who
[1:47:16] you are,
[1:47:19] nobody has to convince you of it. It's a
[1:47:21] revelation that God dropped in your
[1:47:24] heart.
[1:47:28] You abide in me and my words abide in
[1:47:30] you. You shall ask what you will and it
[1:47:33] shall be done unto you.
[1:47:37] Listen Jesus's word. I have power to lay
[1:47:40] my life down and power to take it up. He
[1:47:43] knew who he was.
[1:47:47] If you know who you are, there's no
[1:47:50] devil in hell.
[1:47:53] No devil in hell. Come on. No devil in
[1:47:57] hell.
[1:48:00] No devil in hell.
[1:48:08] None. None can shake you of who you are.
[1:48:23] None.
[1:48:39] Now, Alcoholics
[1:48:41] Anonymous will teach you one day at a
[1:48:44] time, mind over
[1:48:46] matter, how horrible and and to hate
[1:48:49] alcohol and to hate drugs. And so you'll
[1:48:53] start counting
[1:48:55] days. I I've been I've been sober for
[1:48:59] 342
[1:49:00] days. Well, that means tomorrow you've
[1:49:03] got a
[1:49:05] challenge. That means tomorrow you got a
[1:49:08] challenge. Well, I've been clean for
[1:49:10] soever many years. Well, that means
[1:49:12] you're trying to hold on to something
[1:49:14] that's only a thought.
[1:49:18] But with this message and that seed in
[1:49:21] your heart that's been
[1:49:23] illuminated, you know who you are.
[1:49:27] And you're not counting days.
[1:49:31] I say it again. You're not counting
[1:49:33] days.
[1:49:35] You're living in the day. If he comes
[1:49:37] today, I'm going with it. If he comes
[1:49:40] tomorrow, I'm going with it. I'm resting
[1:49:43] on the solemn promises of the word of
[1:49:46] God.
[1:49:56] You're not getting up on Sunday morning
[1:49:58] having to make a
[1:49:59] decision.
[1:50:01] Oh, should we
[1:50:05] go? If you're doing that, you need this
[1:50:07] altar.
[1:50:10] Come on, preach, buddy.
[1:50:14] You're having to hold a gun to your head
[1:50:16] just to come to church. You need this
[1:50:18] altar.
[1:50:19] Cuz a real believer that's in love with
[1:50:22] Jesus Christ,
[1:50:24] they can't wait to walk through those
[1:50:26] doors back there,
[1:50:29] this is a love affair.
[1:50:50] Now, you can give me a few more minutes.
[1:50:54] I didn't set my
[1:50:58] timer. Thank
[1:51:02] you, brother Vernon. reminds me so much
[1:51:04] of brother Homer.
[1:51:08] I sat with the at the table with him
[1:51:11] and takes me back so many times. And
[1:51:14] when I watch Andrew preach, it takes me
[1:51:17] back. And when I watch Andrew sing, it
[1:51:19] takes me back. Listen, you can't deny
[1:51:21] DNA.
[1:51:26] I I just want to say to you, you may be
[1:51:29] new among us.
[1:51:31] You just don't know how much to
[1:51:33] appreciate what we've got.
[1:51:37] You need to thank God of what God's
[1:51:40] doing here at this church.
[1:51:43] You really need to thank God for what
[1:51:44] God's doing
[1:51:46] here. God raised up Andrew. I didn't
[1:51:49] raise him up. And Brother Homer didn't
[1:51:52] raise him up. Andrew came back from
[1:51:54] Vancouver, a changed man, totally
[1:51:57] different. And brother Homer was sitting
[1:51:59] on the he was sitting back here. Homer
[1:52:01] would talk to me during the service and
[1:52:03] he'd talk to me during a service and 90%
[1:52:05] of it was not about
[1:52:10] church. Brother Thomas would say, "Amen.
[1:52:12] I know
[1:52:15] that." And Homer was sitting right back
[1:52:17] here and he said, "You know Andrew is a
[1:52:19] preacher." I said, "Yeah, I know
[1:52:21] that." I said, "Yeah, I know that." He
[1:52:25] said, "He's a preacher." He said he got
[1:52:27] something in
[1:52:28] Vancouver. He's going to be a great
[1:52:33] preacher. And he was right.
[1:52:38] He was right.
[1:52:41] He was
[1:52:42] right. And I just appreciate enjoying
[1:52:46] it. He's my son, but he's more than my
[1:52:49] son. He fed my soul last night.
[1:52:58] I didn't get paid to say that,
[1:53:02] brother. I don't like it. I could care
[1:53:08] less. And I mean that with all my
[1:53:19] heart. People get jealous of Andrew. I
[1:53:22] Is this okay?
[1:53:27] PE people people get jealous of Andrew.
[1:53:30] Listen, you need to get jealous and want
[1:53:32] the God that's in him.
[1:53:44] He's getting ready to go to New Zealand.
[1:53:46] I I've taken a break here. My chest is
[1:53:49] done getting excited, so let me take a
[1:53:51] break. He's getting ready to go to New
[1:53:52] Zealand. I've been there five times,
[1:53:54] preached in a convention he's going to
[1:53:56] for the pastor's father, brother
[1:53:59] Derek. And don't tell him I told this
[1:54:03] story, but Derek was disillusioned and
[1:54:06] he was Derek's son was disillusioned and
[1:54:09] he was in a tough place and he told me
[1:54:12] he said, "I want you to pray for my son.
[1:54:13] He's he's kind of out of church and I
[1:54:16] want you to pray for him."
[1:54:18] And so, Brother Harold Hildebrandt and
[1:54:20] myself was was uh preaching the meeting
[1:54:25] and
[1:54:26] uh so I asked Brother Derek, I said, "Is
[1:54:29] he here?" He said, "Yeah, he's here." I
[1:54:32] said, "Well, you you tell him to drive
[1:54:35] me to
[1:54:36] church." Really? I said, "Yeah, I want
[1:54:39] him as my chauffeur this
[1:54:42] week." So, he came and picked me up.
[1:54:44] Him, me and Brother Harold. I sat in the
[1:54:46] front seat. Harold sat in the back seat.
[1:54:49] I told Harold, I I want to sit in the
[1:54:50] front seat because I want to I want to
[1:54:52] talk to him. And so I sat in the front
[1:54:55] seat with him. I never talked to him
[1:54:57] about
[1:54:58] church. I never talked to him about the
[1:55:01] message. I talked to him about what he
[1:55:04] did. I talked about the woodwork that he
[1:55:07] did. I asked him all the secrets of the
[1:55:09] trade. I said, "Who's the most
[1:55:11] influential person you've ever worked
[1:55:13] for?" And he said, "Donald Trump.
[1:55:17] He said, "I've worked in his yacht and
[1:55:18] I've worked at New York and worked in
[1:55:20] his mansions there in New York. I I've
[1:55:23] worked on that woodwork that he's got
[1:55:25] there." He said, "I like him." He said,
[1:55:28] he's a downto-earth guy. He said, "Now,
[1:55:30] out in the public, he's all of that." He
[1:55:32] said, "But down to earth." He said, he
[1:55:34] said, "He'll leave all the dignitaries
[1:55:35] and come talk to to to us workers."
[1:55:38] Amen.
[1:55:40] I didn't mean to make you mad.
[1:55:45] And we just talked those kind of things
[1:55:46] for days. We we kind of talked that for
[1:55:49] days and I would plan what we were going
[1:55:51] to talk about. I never talked about none
[1:55:53] of those things. On the last day, I saw
[1:55:57] a
[1:56:00] change. I saw a
[1:56:03] change. And then we went to brother
[1:56:05] Derek's house and I saw a
[1:56:08] change. And now he's the pastor of the
[1:56:11] church. And Andrew is going to preach
[1:56:15] there. I may never get to go back there,
[1:56:18] but I'm sending you.
[1:56:21] This church is sending you.
[1:56:27] You're going to tell a story. Well, let
[1:56:29] me tell one more.
[1:56:31] His nephew was at a meeting that I was
[1:56:34] at in
[1:56:35] Belgium, and his nephew was going to
[1:56:38] make a journey home, and there was a
[1:56:40] girl from Arizona. These two had never
[1:56:43] met. And this girl from Arizona, some of
[1:56:45] you might know her on Facebook, but this
[1:56:47] girl from Arizona and they were sitting
[1:56:50] at the train together. And I could tell
[1:56:52] they never spoke a word to each other.
[1:56:54] And brother Gido and myself were going
[1:56:56] to board the train. And we get on the
[1:56:58] train and there's two seats here and
[1:56:59] there's two seats there. And the and one
[1:57:02] of them wants to set with brother Gido
[1:57:03] and one of them wants to sit with me. I
[1:57:05] said, "Oh, no. You two need to set
[1:57:08] together and get to know one another
[1:57:09] because you're going to spend your life
[1:57:12] [Applause]
[1:57:22] together. He went to the door where
[1:57:26] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[1:57:29] was. I don't know. I don't know if
[1:57:31] there's any feelings in that dimension,
[1:57:35] but if there is, their heart must have
[1:57:38] been jumping out of their chest.
[1:57:40] That's him.
[1:57:43] And all of their testimonies and all of
[1:57:45] their life becomes alive.
[1:57:50] All of their life's journey now is
[1:57:54] fulfilled. That's right.
[1:57:57] Job said, "That's him. I knew I would
[1:58:00] see him.
[1:58:02] Sarah, that's him that sat under the oak
[1:58:05] tree.
[1:58:08] David said, "That's him that I built a
[1:58:11] temple for."
[1:58:16] For the critique, he had Solomon to
[1:58:19] build the temple.
[1:58:22] That's
[1:58:25] him. What does that have to do with this
[1:58:27] service? If you can
[1:58:29] recognize that's him.
[1:58:36] Give me two more
[1:58:38] minutes. If you're sitting on the
[1:58:42] fence, you will have to fight your way
[1:58:44] to go to hell.
[1:58:49] You've got loved ones that's doing their
[1:58:51] very best, fighting their way,
[1:58:55] and they don't know what this will do
[1:58:57] for them.
[1:59:00] They're fighting the very thing of what
[1:59:03] this will do.
[1:59:05] Hey, listen. There's people that have
[1:59:06] sit in your church for decades and walk
[1:59:09] away. What they walked away
[1:59:13] from was what will put them there.
[1:59:21] Maybe I'll preach this again after I
[1:59:23] come home.
[1:59:25] What is the cost of walking
[1:59:28] away? Let's just talk about that just
[1:59:30] for a
[1:59:32] minute. In the New Testament, there's
[1:59:35] two names that's called Janice and
[1:59:40] Jamas.
[1:59:45] They're not even mentioned in the Old
[1:59:47] Testament.
[1:59:50] Not even
[1:59:51] mentioned. They're not mentioned. But
[1:59:54] God remembered.
[1:59:58] Notice they became the
[2:00:01] opponent to the prophet.
[2:00:05] I cannot imagine on judgment day. That's
[2:00:09] right. Being known not for all the great
[2:00:12] that I done in life, but being known for
[2:00:16] being the opponent to the message.
[2:00:19] Amen.
[2:00:22] I don't know how many people walked away
[2:00:23] from your church and believed thy sign
[2:00:25] and against brother Biscll and against
[2:00:27] the message of the hour and said all
[2:00:29] kind of ugly
[2:00:31] things but they may be
[2:00:34] millionaires but on that day
[2:00:38] they'll be known.
[2:00:51] for walking
[2:00:57] away. Hey, that's hard. I know that's a
[2:01:01] difficult
[2:01:05] statement, but now becomes the reality
[2:01:08] of fighting your way to go to
[2:01:11] hell. What do you mean fighting?
[2:01:13] Fighting the message,
[2:01:16] fighting
[2:01:17] Wesley, fighting Martin Luther, fighting
[2:01:21] William Brham,
[2:01:23] fighting Donnie Reagan, fighting Ed
[2:01:25] Biscll,
[2:01:27] fighting your way to hell,
[2:01:33] and the opponents that are against
[2:01:35] you, that fight you on Facebook and
[2:01:38] fight you and all kind of nonsense,
[2:01:41] forgive them.
[2:01:43] They're creating their own judgment.
[2:01:53] That's hard, Brother Ron. No, they made
[2:01:55] it hard.
[2:01:58] I'm just a preacher of
[2:01:59] message. They made it hard.
[2:02:03] They made it
[2:02:05] hard. Now, my last statement. When he's
[2:02:09] walking up the hill, they were
[2:02:11] screaming, "What did he do to you?
[2:02:15] What did he do to
[2:02:17] you? What made you want to crucify him?
[2:02:21] He healed your sick. He raised the dead.
[2:02:25] He fed the 5000. He forgave you."
[2:02:30] What spirit made you want to call
[2:02:33] crucify him?
[2:02:40] What did William Brandham do to you?
[2:02:47] What did William Brandham do to you?
[2:02:51] What did Homer Frasier do to you?
[2:02:55] What did Ron Spencer do to you?
[2:03:00] I love my own worst enemy.
[2:03:03] That's the God that's in me.
[2:03:06] I can forgive you, but what did I do to
[2:03:09] you?
[2:03:11] What did temperate do to you? I could
[2:03:14] list the names. What did they do to you?
[2:03:18] That's
[2:03:27] right. So then they fulfill the quote
[2:03:30] that I read.
[2:03:33] You're fighting your way to hell. Amen.
[2:03:38] You're not fighting
[2:03:39] Walmart. You're not fighting the
[2:03:41] Cowboys. You're not fighting Donald
[2:03:44] Trump.
[2:03:47] You're fighting God.
[2:03:56] They walk out of Brother Brandham's
[2:03:57] meeting. They light up cigarettes in the
[2:04:00] meeting.
[2:04:03] Brother Chris, I would hate to be
[2:04:06] known. This all takes my breath. I would
[2:04:09] hate to be
[2:04:10] known as sitting in Brother Brand's
[2:04:13] meeting and light a cigarette.
[2:04:15] Disrespect.
[2:04:17] Amen.
[2:04:28] I don't know where this sermon will go.
[2:04:29] I be really honest with you. That's not
[2:04:32] up to me. My job is to preach it.
[2:04:36] My job is to preach it and try to help
[2:04:37] you. That's right. I want to say this to
[2:04:41] you. I don't want none of you to go to
[2:04:43] hell.
[2:04:47] Listen, there's no reprieve once you go.
[2:04:52] This ain't Hollywood where they rewrite
[2:04:54] the book.
[2:04:56] This is where you get it fixed,
[2:04:59] brother. Brother Ron, but I got
[2:05:00] problems. Get them fixed.
[2:05:04] Get them fixed while your heart's still
[2:05:07] beating.
[2:05:09] Don't wait till you get in the grave.
[2:05:14] Don't wait till you get dementia and
[2:05:16] say, "Oh, I got to get it fixed.
[2:05:21] Well, I got this against that person. I
[2:05:23] got this against that person. I I you
[2:05:25] know I I
[2:05:29] I Father forgive
[2:05:33] me. Father, I surrender my
[2:05:37] life. You may not be able to get down on
[2:05:40] your knees, but call on God.
[2:05:42] I'm not going to make a public spectacle
[2:05:44] of you, but quit serving God halfway.
[2:06:04] Brother
[2:06:05] Jonathan, God wants first place in my
[2:06:08] life, right? He don't want second,
[2:06:11] third, fourth. He wants first place.
[2:06:17] And let me just give you a little piece
[2:06:19] here. If he's
[2:06:22] first, everything else will line up.
[2:06:36] I'm going to just say something to you,
[2:06:37] brother Matt. You've only been here a
[2:06:40] couple of months and there's a notable
[2:06:46] difference. And I'm not trying to to say
[2:06:48] anything
[2:06:50] bad, but this
[2:06:52] Christ, this living word that you have
[2:06:56] fought
[2:06:57] for, you can enjoy.
[2:07:03] And it's not just good for you, it's
[2:07:05] good for your wife and it's good for
[2:07:08] your children.
[2:07:09] [Applause]
[2:07:26] It's your
[2:07:28] turn. And when you were planning, you
[2:07:30] were planning where to
[2:07:33] go on your time
[2:07:36] off. You were planning where to go. And
[2:07:40] God put on his heart that you would your
[2:07:42] heart that you would come and you would
[2:07:45] stay at my house. Joel told you would
[2:07:48] have
[2:07:52] come. And God spoke to me last night and
[2:07:56] said, "She's come for a deeper
[2:07:59] experience
[2:08:00] with Jesus Christ." You can have a great
[2:08:04] job and you can have great things in
[2:08:06] your life.
[2:08:09] A boyfriend won't fulfill that.
[2:08:12] Having the greatest job in the world
[2:08:14] won't fulfill that. But what you're
[2:08:16] feeling right now,
[2:08:19] why don't you just let it soak your
[2:08:21] heart right now, Tiffany?
[2:08:26] He sent you here for this.
[2:08:32] Hit that
[2:08:41] right. I want you all to bow your heads
[2:08:44] now.
[2:08:46] I don't know how to end
[2:08:50] it, but there's a presence in this
[2:08:52] building that is so
[2:09:00] strong. I'm not going to ask you to come
[2:09:02] to the
[2:09:03] altar. If you want to do that, that's
[2:09:06] great. But there's some things you need
[2:09:09] to fix.
[2:09:22] in this presence. You can get it
[2:09:25] fixed. Don't let pride rob you of it
[2:09:28] right
[2:09:29] now. Don't let your self-will rob you of
[2:09:32] it right now. Young people, you can fix
[2:09:34] it right now. Father, I surrender my
[2:09:37] whole life to you. Would you just raise
[2:09:39] your hands all over the building? say,
[2:09:41] "I need him. I need him so much. I need
[2:09:45] him so much. I need
[2:09:48] him. I just so need
[2:09:52] him. I so need
[2:10:03] him. Lord Jesus, we feel the nearness of
[2:10:06] your presence.
[2:10:15] You're such a personal
[2:10:23] God, Lord. We We couldn't even put
[2:10:27] oursel
[2:10:28] here, but you
[2:10:31] came. The difference of us than the
[2:10:34] world is you.
[2:10:38] You changed our
[2:10:45] life. Now Lord, if there's any
[2:10:48] indifference, anything that's not
[2:10:50] right, anything that's contaminating our
[2:10:56] spirit, Lord, would you just come and
[2:10:58] clean that
[2:11:01] out? Just come clean that
[2:11:04] out. I've been watching things I
[2:11:06] shouldn't watch. I've been listening to
[2:11:09] things I shouldn't listen to. I've been
[2:11:11] feeding on the wrong
[2:11:14] things.
[2:11:16] Father,
[2:11:18] Father, Lord, touch people's lives all
[2:11:21] across this building, even on the
[2:11:24] internet. May they feel in their living
[2:11:27] room right now your solemn, holy
[2:11:29] presence.
[2:11:32] The Lord
[2:11:35] Jesus, you went to
[2:11:38] hell so I wouldn't have to
[2:11:46] go. And
[2:11:49] Lord, all of us want more of
[2:11:52] you. That's our deepest
[2:11:55] desire is to love you more, to know you
[2:11:59] more.
[2:12:02] And I'd like you to invite you,
[2:12:04] Father, into my life like never
[2:12:09] before. Lord, I said this this morning
[2:12:11] when I was up early
[2:12:14] praying. I've preached I've preached
[2:12:17] over 40 years, but I want more of you
[2:12:20] today than I've ever had.
[2:12:26] I have went through a
[2:12:29] trial for five years
[2:12:32] now and doctors never thought I'd be
[2:12:35] here. But
[2:12:38] you you allowed me to go through this
[2:12:42] trial. And Lord, if I've got to go
[2:12:45] through a trial, I pray it brings me
[2:12:48] closer to you than ever before.
[2:12:54] Help me
[2:12:55] God. Help me to be a better
[2:12:58] pastor. Help me to be a better better
[2:13:03] preacher. Help me to be a better
[2:13:06] husband. Help me to be a better
[2:13:09] daddy. Help me to be a better
[2:13:13] grandfather. Don't let me waste a day.
[2:13:20] I want individuals to know the
[2:13:23] Christ that lives in
[2:13:27] me. I want to be known for one thing, to
[2:13:31] be a real
[2:13:32] Christian. That's what my desire is. I
[2:13:36] don't care if people know my name. I
[2:13:39] want to be known as a real
[2:13:42] Christian. One that exudes love and
[2:13:46] cares. Help me
[2:13:49] father. Help me God. I
[2:13:52] pray in Jesus Christ's name I ask
[2:13:56] you. In Jesus Christ's name I ask
[2:14:01] you. Amen. Could we stand and sing that
[2:14:04] Andrew? Only believe all things are
[2:14:08] possible.
[2:14:20] Have you felt him come near to you
[2:14:22] today?
[2:14:27] Have you felt him come near? Amen.
[2:14:32] Well, while he's near, let him change
[2:14:34] your life.
[2:14:37] This song
[2:14:41] was uncctioned to the prophet of the
[2:14:43] Lord that the angel loved this
[2:14:49] song. Sister Dorothy, isn't he so
[2:14:52] [Music]
[2:14:58] special? Now today, your your situation
[2:15:01] looks
[2:15:03] impossible.
[2:15:05] totally
[2:15:08] impossible. But God is a God of
[2:15:13] impossibilities. But he asks you to do
[2:15:15] one
[2:15:16] thing. Just
[2:15:19] believe. In a few minutes when we walk
[2:15:21] out of this church, I pray something is
[2:15:24] anchored in your
[2:15:25] soul. regardless of the
[2:15:29] storm. Father, I'm going to believe and
[2:15:33] I'm going to trust
[2:15:35] you. Oh
[2:15:39] Lord, I
[2:15:43] believe.
[2:15:46] Lord, I believe.
[2:15:52] All
[2:15:54] things are
[2:15:55] [Music]
[2:15:58] possible. Lord,
[2:16:01] I
[2:16:03] believe. Let's just worship him.
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:14] Lord, I
[2:16:19] believe all
[2:16:22] things are
[2:16:26] possible. Lord,
[2:16:30] I want you to think about your
[2:16:31] impossibility right now and claim the
[2:16:34] promise.
[2:16:41] [Music]
[2:16:50] believe that all things are possible.
[2:16:57] [Music]
[2:16:59] Lord,
[2:17:01] I
[2:17:04] believe.
[2:17:08] Oh, believe
[2:17:11] me, you
[2:17:15] only
[2:17:18] believe that all things are possible.
[2:17:26] [Music]
[2:17:27] Lord
[2:17:29] of the
[2:17:32] name. I'd
[2:17:36] rather have
[2:17:40] Jesus than
[2:17:43] silver or gold.
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:48] I'd
[2:17:50] rather be
[2:17:53] here than every
[2:17:58] chase
[2:18:01] untold. I'd
[2:18:04] rather have
[2:18:07] [Music]
[2:18:08] Jesus than
[2:18:11] housees or land.
[2:18:16] I
[2:18:18] gather they
[2:18:22] live by his
[2:18:25] [Applause]
[2:18:26] name
[2:18:29] sh than to
[2:18:32] be the
[2:18:36] king of a
[2:18:39] vast domain.
[2:18:43] [Music]
[2:18:46] Hell it seems
[2:18:51] It's

[2:20:41] overcome.
[2:20:49] I could stop and count
[2:20:54] successes like diamonds in rings.
[2:21:02] Oh, but those trophies were not
[2:21:07] equal to
[2:21:11] grace on which I
[2:21:16] stand in Christ alone.
[2:21:22] I place my

[2:22:22] And only
[2:22:25] his tender
[2:22:28] mercies can reach beyond my weakness to
[2:22:34] my knees.
[2:22:39] Oh
[2:22:41] now I seek no gater
[2:22:47] honor oh than just the
[2:22:54] Lord. Oh and to count my gains
[2:23:01] belongings for the glory.
[2:23:06] You're my Lord.
[2:23:11] In Christ
[2:23:15] alone I place my
[2:23:22] trust and find my
[2:23:25] glory. The power of
