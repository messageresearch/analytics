[47:29] Mark amen chapter
[47:32] 4 just a couple short texts tonight
[47:36] before we go into the
[47:38] word starting verse
[47:53] 35 it says in the same day when the even
[47:56] was was come he saith unto them let us
[47:58] pass over under the other side and when
[48:01] they had sent away the multitude they
[48:03] took him even as he was in the ship and
[48:06] there were also with him other little
[48:08] ships and there arose a great storm of
[48:10] wind and the waves beat into the ship so
[48:13] that it was now full and he was in the
[48:15] hinder part of the ship asleep on a
[48:17] pillow and they awake him and say unto
[48:19] him Master carest thou not that we
[48:22] perish and he arose and rebuked the wind
[48:25] and said unto the sea peace be still
[48:27] and the wind ceased and there was a
[48:29] great calm and they said unto them why
[48:30] are you so fearful how is it that you
[48:33] have no faith and they feared
[48:35] exceedingly and said one to another what
[48:37] manner of man is this that even the wind
[48:39] and the Sea obey him and one verse in 2
[48:42] Corinthians 4 verse 18 you don't have to
[48:46] turn there we'll just read it why we
[48:48] look not at the things which are seen
[48:50] But at the things which are not seen for
[48:53] the things which are seen are temporal
[48:55] but the things which are not seen our
[48:57] Eternal amen if we could bow our heads
[49:00] for a word of prayer Heavenly Father
[49:02] we're just so thankful to be in your
[49:04] house once again tonight Lord just to
[49:07] feel your presence sweep into this
[49:08] building father through the worship Lord
[49:11] to know that you thought enough of us
[49:13] just to come into our midst father Lord
[49:16] for you promised where two or three are
[49:18] gathered in your name you'd be in in
[49:20] their midst and father we welcome you
[49:22] Lord in this building tonight father I
[49:24] pray you bless this congregation Lord I
[49:27] I have no ability of a man to speak to
[49:29] their needs but father I pray you just
[49:31] help me to get out of the way Lord that
[49:33] you close my lips to from speaking
[49:36] anything that you wouldn't have to be
[49:37] spoken and Lord I pray you open my lips
[49:39] to speak Lord what the needs would be in
[49:42] this building tonight and even those
[49:44] maybe on the stream that couldn't be
[49:45] here that are Lord that are maybe
[49:48] homesick and things that you just have
[49:50] your way father you just go down the
[49:52] Lord the RADS of of this building and
[49:54] that you just speak to the hearts the
[49:56] lives and we'll be sure to give you all
[49:58] the glory and all the honor in the name
[50:00] of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be
[50:03] seated tonight we just want to take a
[50:05] little thought out of those two texts on
[50:07] when the on scene comes on the scene
[50:10] when the on scene comes on the scene and
[50:12] you're all familiar with the the message
[50:14] of course looking at the on scene and
[50:16] brother Brandon preaches this uh uh many
[50:19] times he begins to to lay these thoughts
[50:21] out to us of looking at the onene and
[50:24] how the believer is not looking at
[50:26] things which they see with their natural
[50:28] eyes but you're you're built with a
[50:30] sense of Faith to look at the Unseen and
[50:32] he would tell us that the Unseen things
[50:34] are the real things and he said it's
[50:37] that world of Eternal that we're
[50:38] interested in and he said go down to the
[50:40] store and buy me love and go and buy me
[50:43] a a jar of Joy or or or go and buy
[50:46] personality or go and buy the Holy
[50:48] Spirit he said you won't be able to do
[50:49] it because those are the Unseen things
[50:52] but but he said we put so much emphasis
[50:55] on the natural things that we can see
[50:57] you know we put so much emphasis on our
[50:59] homes and our our vehicles and things at
[51:02] times sometimes people in the world
[51:03] that's the only thing they have as that
[51:05] all the emphasis they have is all on
[51:07] carnal things when those aren't even the
[51:10] real things or the lasting things and
[51:12] the believer's whole Supernatural armor
[51:14] is made up of the Unseen your armor is
[51:17] made up of your joy your peace your
[51:19] armor is Supernatural your walk is
[51:21] Supernatural it's an unseen walk with
[51:23] the Unseen God but we see that the
[51:26] spirit of lead DEA would say that I am
[51:28] rich and increased with goods and have
[51:30] need of nothing and and he said uh I he
[51:33] said but they know not that they're
[51:34] wretched and miserable and poor he said
[51:37] but come and I counsel thee to buy me
[51:39] gold tried in the fire I counsel thee to
[51:41] buy of me rment and I counsel thee to
[51:43] buy of me isaf here he is what a paradox
[51:46] saying he's saying you're poor though
[51:48] you think you're rich with all these
[51:49] world's Goods but come and buy of me how
[51:52] could they come and buy of him when they
[51:54] didn't have any money he just called him
[51:56] poor but he said here's a place you can
[51:58] come without money and without price you
[52:00] can get gold you can get your character
[52:03] you can get the reignment of the word
[52:05] you can come and you can get isab to see
[52:07] the word for your hour he said these are
[52:10] the things that you need to come and buy
[52:12] these things you can buy without money
[52:13] but you you can come to me and I'll give
[52:15] you a pearl of great price I'll give you
[52:18] something that's Eternal something
[52:19] that's lasting amen and that's what we
[52:21] want to put the emphasis on is the
[52:23] things of God the things of that Unseen
[52:25] World for you're you're you're a
[52:27] Creature built up of an outward man and
[52:29] an inward man and and that outward man
[52:31] is that that's yourself that that's your
[52:34] nature your your your carnal man but
[52:36] that inward man is is God and brother
[52:39] Brandon would say that it's a strange
[52:41] thing that man would choose to walk by
[52:43] sight man that was created in the image
[52:45] of God and and when you were created in
[52:48] the image of God it was a spirit man and
[52:50] he only put that Spirit man in this
[52:52] flesh to Habitat this Earth and to go
[52:55] and to plow the Feld
[52:57] that's why he gave you this flesh and
[52:58] those five senses to contact this world
[53:01] but as man begin to grow and Begin to
[53:03] Fall Away From God they begin to put so
[53:05] much emphasis on that on that carnal man
[53:07] on that outward man and begin to walk by
[53:09] that outward man in its senses and
[53:11] forgot to walk by that inward man which
[53:13] is the real you but brother BR say when
[53:16] you walk by that outward man you and you
[53:18] walk by sight you actually Rob the
[53:20] inward man you rob that real you of the
[53:23] things of God because that's what
[53:24] matters to the believer that's what
[53:26] matters to to us tonight is that that we
[53:29] would come in contact with something
[53:30] that would that would hold you a keeping
[53:32] power that would keep you in the trials
[53:34] that would keep you in the low times in
[53:36] the High Times in the dark times and if
[53:39] all you ever get in life is just a a
[53:42] build up of material things then it'll
[53:44] be a it'll be a fleeting thing and what
[53:46] would be the value of that but we've
[53:48] come with an interest tonight to get a
[53:50] hold of something Eternal to begin to
[53:52] tap into that Unseen World where we
[53:55] could begin to realize that God is in
[53:56] the room and all things are possible and
[53:59] he's the same yesterday today and
[54:00] forever and you begin to lay all those
[54:02] other senses aside and you begin to let
[54:05] that sick sense of Faith which is that
[54:07] real you to begin to come into contact
[54:09] with the word of God and begin to pull
[54:11] on that word of God and say it's for me
[54:14] the promise is for me and you begin to
[54:16] walk by that instead of your your your
[54:18] own
[54:20] feelings oh you you can walk in your own
[54:22] way but God will let you walk alone
[54:25] he'll let you just go he'll let
[54:26] you can walk with a thousand friends in
[54:29] your own way and walk without God and be
[54:31] as alone as you could be but if the only
[54:34] friend you have in this world is Jesus
[54:36] then I say walk with Jesus walk with the
[54:39] Lord walk with this message and he'll be
[54:41] your friend he'll be your God he'll walk
[54:43] you through these scriptures he'll give
[54:45] you eyes to have to see he'll give you
[54:47] the things of Eternal value oh and it'll
[54:49] be worth it all not to walk by your own
[54:52] mind but let this mind which is in
[54:54] Christ Jesus be in you but I'm I'm so
[54:57] thankful that God provided a way to look
[54:58] at the Unseen how could Jesus as a as a
[55:01] Nazarene Carpenter tell them that you
[55:03] were just on the other side of the
[55:05] mountain I saw you praying under a tree
[55:08] How could a lowly man that was born and
[55:10] he walked in flesh like you and me how
[55:12] could he know these things but he was
[55:14] endued with the power to look at the
[55:16] Unseen but God did not just limit that
[55:19] to to Jesus Christ but he said except a
[55:21] man be born again he cannot see the
[55:23] kingdom of God he said I'm going to give
[55:25] you a way that you can be endued with a
[55:27] power that you'll have another sight to
[55:29] walk by you won't have to walk by your
[55:31] natural sight anymore but I'll give you
[55:33] a spiritual sight you'll be able to see
[55:35] the kingdom of God and to see the
[55:37] kingdom of God is not to look upon it
[55:39] with your eyes but brother Bron said
[55:41] it's to understand I'll give you the
[55:43] ability to understand my kingdom I'll
[55:45] give you the ability to understand my
[55:47] word and my promises in this hour oh and
[55:51] then they would come in the Book of John
[55:52] and say he that heareth my word and
[55:55] believeth on him that s me shall not
[55:57] perish but has everlasting life and you
[55:59] shall not come in the Judgment brother
[56:01] Brandon would say that word hearing
[56:02] doesn't necessarily mean to hear for
[56:04] many could hear and walk away but that
[56:07] hear means to understand to him that
[56:10] understandeth my word because many could
[56:12] hear and walk away and they have nothing
[56:14] to believe with there's nothing in them
[56:17] to believe this word with but there's
[56:18] something about you you've been indued
[56:20] with another power that you have the
[56:23] ability to hear you have the ability to
[56:25] see and blessed are your eyes if they
[56:28] hear this word and blessed are your ears
[56:30] if you have the ability to understand
[56:32] this word you see we don't walk by sight
[56:35] we don't walk by our
[56:36] hearing and many say you know brother
[56:39] Brandon would give us the example that
[56:41] that people say seeing is believing and
[56:44] he would say oh come upon the stage and
[56:46] do you hear that music he said do you
[56:48] see that music no you don't you hear it
[56:50] so how could seeing be believing and he
[56:52] would begin to lay in these examples how
[56:54] those five senses of your natur man we
[56:57] not believing but he would say
[56:59] understanding is believing when you
[57:01] understand the promise of God it brings
[57:03] a faith into your heart that you can
[57:06] walk and you can persevere and you can
[57:08] hold on to that promise because he said
[57:11] except a man be born again you cannot
[57:13] see the kingdom of God you have to
[57:15] accept it by faith but then when God
[57:17] drops it in your heart brother there
[57:19] comes an understanding and that's the
[57:21] way the same way he said you believe for
[57:23] healing you just take an understanding
[57:25] of this scripture and you begin to hold
[57:27] on to that and that understanding is
[57:29] what you walk by because your natural
[57:31] sight May declare a lot of things to you
[57:33] your symptoms may be up and down your
[57:36] feelings may be up and down but that
[57:38] understanding doesn't change that
[57:40] understanding in your heart is steadfast
[57:42] for it's built on the word of God and
[57:44] you have a right to walk with that
[57:46] understanding and God has made a way
[57:48] that through a new birth brother you
[57:50] could be a candidate for association
[57:52] with this on scen world automatically
[57:54] you don't just have an outward anymore
[57:56] but there's an inward man that believes
[57:58] you're associated with the promise of
[58:00] God you're associated with the
[58:02] Supernatural and he's given you an
[58:04] understanding that you could say I
[58:06] understand by my sight that there's a
[58:08] lot of problems going on right now I
[58:10] understand that in this church tonight
[58:12] that there's situations that you could
[58:14] try to touch W with your natural man and
[58:16] you would ruin them and they would fall
[58:18] apart I understand that there's sickness
[58:20] that the doctors have have no ability to
[58:22] heal that there's complexes and
[58:24] tormenting spirits that we can never
[58:26] deliver with her own ability but because
[58:28] I have another understanding I believe
[58:31] that there is a God that could come into
[58:33] this building tonight and I understand
[58:35] that every sick person could leave here
[58:36] healed I understand that every bound
[58:39] person possessed by the devil could
[58:41] leave here free as can be I understand
[58:43] that there is a God that could come on
[58:45] the scene and turn everything around oh
[58:48] and that's what I'm walking by tonight
[58:49] I'm not look and what I see with my eyes
[58:51] I'm not leaning to my own understanding
[58:54] because if I lean to my own
[58:55] understanding would be in the pits
[58:57] tonight but I'm leaning on the
[58:59] understanding of the word of God that
[59:01] all things are possible that Jesus
[59:03] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[59:05] forever he's still a Healer he's still a
[59:08] deliverer he still sets the captive free
[59:11] oh and by this word I understand that I
[59:13] don't have to understand I don't have to
[59:15] understand everything in my own ability
[59:17] I don't have to understand what you're
[59:18] going through I don't have to understand
[59:20] your family history to know that God's a
[59:22] deliverer that God's A Healer that God
[59:25] can break that cycle that you've been
[59:27] living in for days and weeks oh you find
[59:30] yourself in the night hours desperate
[59:32] for a touch but I understand that there
[59:34] is a God that we serve that can come on
[59:36] the scene in this building tonight and
[59:38] end that thing oh that's what you
[59:41] believe with it's understanding aren't
[59:43] you thankful for understanding oh
[59:45] there's a lot of power and understanding
[59:47] for brother Brandon would tell us that
[59:49] that Maniac of gadera was so possessed
[59:51] by the devil that he didn't even have
[59:53] his own understanding anymore and if
[59:55] that would work in the negative what
[59:56] about the positive that a people could
[59:58] be so possessed by the holy spirit that
[1:00:01] you would lose your own understanding
[1:00:03] and begin to step into that Unseen World
[1:00:05] and say God I'm not going to walk that
[1:00:06] way anymore but I'm going to look at the
[1:00:09] promise and I'm going to press the
[1:00:10] battle because I understand that it's
[1:00:12] finished at Calvary the blood that you
[1:00:14] shed already paid the price I don't have
[1:00:17] to live in this bondage anymore the
[1:00:19] prison Gates have been open oh and when
[1:00:21] God calls you oh you may feel like an
[1:00:24] eagle in a cage but God's calling over
[1:00:26] your life open that door to let you out
[1:00:29] and if you hear that word calling you to
[1:00:30] a higher plane tonight you can recognize
[1:00:33] that the door's open and all you got to
[1:00:34] do is fly out oh by the promise of the
[1:00:37] word that's what we're looking at God's
[1:00:39] A Healer oh his word is the same
[1:00:42] yesterday today and forever oh I know
[1:00:44] that Devil's a liar and he'll try to get
[1:00:46] in your ear and Whisper to you those
[1:00:47] lies but he's the father of Lies but
[1:00:50] there is a truth of this word oh and
[1:00:52] don't let the LIE of the devil be your
[1:00:54] limit but let this word be your limit
[1:00:57] and if this word says there's a higher
[1:00:58] place to go than brother go ahead and
[1:01:00] climb into those higher places by the
[1:01:03] understanding of your inward man oh it's
[1:01:07] a finished work oh he's given us another
[1:01:09] sight and that's how we're walking
[1:01:11] tonight you know the testimony of John
[1:01:14] Ryan how he was blind and he went
[1:01:16] through the prayer line and brother
[1:01:17] brandom prayed over him and he went
[1:01:19] about thinking that he was healed oh he
[1:01:22] came back to that prayer line again he
[1:01:24] said brother random I'm still blind I
[1:01:25] thought you said I was healed he said
[1:01:27] well I thought you said you believed oh
[1:01:30] and then he left that place and he be to
[1:01:32] testify extra extra Read All About It by
[1:01:35] his stripes I'm Healed oh nothing
[1:01:37] changed with his natural lies but some
[1:01:39] sort of understanding must have dropped
[1:01:41] down in his heart to realize that it's
[1:01:43] finished and he began to testify of the
[1:01:46] finished work oh because he was walking
[1:01:48] by an understanding oh it's with the
[1:01:51] eyes of God that you look for Jeremiah
[1:01:54] said hear now this oh fool people and
[1:01:56] without understanding which have eyes
[1:01:58] and see not and have ears and hear not
[1:02:01] so it's possible to have eyes and ears
[1:02:04] and not understand but then Paul said
[1:02:06] that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:08] the father of Glory may give unto you
[1:02:11] the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in
[1:02:12] the knowledge of him that the eyes of
[1:02:15] your understanding being enlightened you
[1:02:17] may know what is the hope of his calling
[1:02:19] and the riches of the glory of his
[1:02:21] inheritance in the Saints oh that's the
[1:02:24] understanding that we're interested in
[1:02:25] tonight
[1:02:26] oh I I would rather have the eyes of my
[1:02:29] understanding opened than my natural
[1:02:31] eyes any day of the week oh that's the
[1:02:33] vision that we're interested
[1:02:35] in and there's so much power in it that
[1:02:38] the woman at the well one day could say
[1:02:41] I perceive that you're a prophet I I
[1:02:44] understand that you're a prophet and
[1:02:46] we've heard that there's a messiah
[1:02:48] coming we've heard these things but he
[1:02:50] would begin to tell her that it was he
[1:02:53] that it was he that was the Messiah it
[1:02:55] was he that they were looking for and
[1:02:57] brother when she got that understanding
[1:02:59] she went into the City and said come see
[1:03:01] a man oh that knows the very thoughts of
[1:03:03] your heart come see a messiah isn't this
[1:03:06] he that we've been looking for oh when
[1:03:08] she got an understanding oh it brought a
[1:03:11] liberty into her life and when you see
[1:03:14] this message as as more than a man as
[1:03:17] more than as more than William brandom
[1:03:19] or or it's more than just a bunch a
[1:03:21] bunch of books and tapes but when you
[1:03:23] see this message as Jesus Christ on
[1:03:26] Earth again veiled in in another mask
[1:03:29] and brother it'll produce a liberty
[1:03:31] it'll produce a freedom in your life
[1:03:34] because it's an understanding and and if
[1:03:37] you don't have the right understanding
[1:03:40] then you'll go off into all kinds of uh
[1:03:43] of battles and hardships but but I I
[1:03:46] believe that the Lord tonight is
[1:03:47] gracious and and I believe the Lord
[1:03:49] could bring such an understanding in
[1:03:51] this building tonight of of who he is of
[1:03:55] the Pres
[1:03:56] revelation of his presence here in our
[1:03:59] midst the the fact that he's a Healer
[1:04:02] not just a Healer but your Healer not
[1:04:05] just a deliverer but your deliverer not
[1:04:07] just a savior but your savior I pray
[1:04:10] that Spirit of Revelation would just
[1:04:12] strike strike our hearts it makes you
[1:04:15] realize why brother Brandon would say
[1:04:17] the necessity to pray for Revelation uh
[1:04:20] how necess how necessary that is for
[1:04:23] that's what will give you an ability to
[1:04:25] walk talk with the word of
[1:04:28] God it's through faith we understand
[1:04:30] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:04:32] of God so that things which are seen
[1:04:34] were not made by things which do appear
[1:04:37] and if you don't understand
[1:04:39] something what can help you understand
[1:04:41] at times is to focus you know if you're
[1:04:43] reading a book sometimes I read a book
[1:04:46] and and I'll be reading I I'll be
[1:04:48] several Pages down and I'll be like man
[1:04:50] I I I can't remember anything I just
[1:04:53] read you'll be halfway through the
[1:04:55] chapter and you'll have no clue what you
[1:04:58] just read and you're all right I'm going
[1:04:59] to have to focus or else I'm going to
[1:05:01] miss the understanding of what's being
[1:05:03] said and so you start to focus and
[1:05:05] brother Brandon would say in Victory day
[1:05:07] that God invites man to look but man
[1:05:09] wants to look his own way and God's
[1:05:12] trying to get man to look at that
[1:05:13] innocent substitute but he says they
[1:05:16] finally look but they fail to focus
[1:05:18] right and and they pick up the
[1:05:19] binoculars of that word and they start
[1:05:21] looking and he would give us the example
[1:05:23] that sometimes you can look through
[1:05:25] binocular and see uh maybe three deers
[1:05:28] standing out in the field when really
[1:05:30] there's only one deer out there and so
[1:05:32] he said you got to focus right and and
[1:05:34] you'll see that there's only one deer is
[1:05:36] that they would pick up the word but
[1:05:37] they would fail to focus right and and
[1:05:39] they'd have two Lords and three gods and
[1:05:42] and all kinds of things out there that
[1:05:43] are contrary to the word uh when the
[1:05:45] word says there's one Lord one faith and
[1:05:48] and one baptism and so he said there's a
[1:05:50] focus that you can come to in the word
[1:05:54] and Eve and Eve when she listened to the
[1:05:56] LIE of that serpent uh it brought
[1:05:59] another Focus to her mind that was
[1:06:01] contrary to the word and where they used
[1:06:03] to be one way now there was two ways and
[1:06:05] and she began to walk in two ways and
[1:06:08] and the Bible tells us how can two walk
[1:06:10] together except they be agreed and and
[1:06:12] so she broke Fellowship in that Garden
[1:06:15] of Eden and and you know the story but
[1:06:18] but but God has provided a way that you
[1:06:20] could come back to the word and you
[1:06:22] could say what the word says and I just
[1:06:24] believe that if if the Lord spoke it
[1:06:26] then we have a right to focus on it
[1:06:28] tonight we have a right to focus on
[1:06:30] every promise we have a right to focus
[1:06:32] on on everything that he said we could
[1:06:35] have and and I I believe if you're sick
[1:06:37] tonight you have a right to take us hold
[1:06:39] of that scripture and begin to focus on
[1:06:41] it and as you focus on it it'll begin to
[1:06:44] come more real it'll begin to drop into
[1:06:46] your heart if you need the Holy Ghost
[1:06:49] young person you can begin to focus on
[1:06:51] that promise and you can begin to push
[1:06:53] out all those other opinions that it's
[1:06:55] not for for you uh that you're too young
[1:06:57] or that you're too old or or or that
[1:06:59] you're too far gone that that that that
[1:07:02] you're not able to receive it but you
[1:07:03] begin to focus in on that word and and
[1:07:06] there's a power in that Focus for
[1:07:09] brother Brandon brother Brandon was a
[1:07:11] prophet and and he was also a hunter and
[1:07:14] he would take a hold of that Winchester
[1:07:16] rifle that he had and he would go out
[1:07:18] there and he could drive a tack at 50
[1:07:20] yards Time After Time After Time but he
[1:07:23] come to the place one time where that r
[1:07:25] begin to shoot off and so he be to
[1:07:27] wonder well well what's wrong with this
[1:07:29] rifle what's wrong and he began to get
[1:07:31] so tormented by it you know why because
[1:07:34] because he had seen that rifle shoot in
[1:07:37] the same spot time after time at 50
[1:07:40] yards now those other brothers could
[1:07:42] walk out and they could shoot that
[1:07:43] squirrel in the body they could shoot it
[1:07:45] in the leg they could shoot it in the
[1:07:47] foot they could do whatever they wanted
[1:07:49] and not be bothered by it but this so
[1:07:51] bothered the prophet that that he found
[1:07:54] himself laying under a tree weeping
[1:07:56] saying Lord why did you send me here why
[1:07:58] did you send me into these meetings why
[1:08:00] am I like this and he found himself in a
[1:08:02] state of depression because the rifle
[1:08:05] wouldn't shoot the way it should have
[1:08:07] and he began to God began to reveal to
[1:08:09] him that as that he made him that way
[1:08:11] for a purpose because he would get up
[1:08:13] behind that pulpit and he wouldn't just
[1:08:15] get up and preach something just by an
[1:08:17] unction of his own mind but he would lay
[1:08:19] in those scriptures and he would lay in
[1:08:21] that word until he knew exactly what it
[1:08:24] meant until he knew exactly what the
[1:08:26] revelation of it was and he delivered
[1:08:28] onto us a focused message that we would
[1:08:31] have something to look at oh and he knew
[1:08:33] that it would do it he had seen how in
[1:08:35] the book of Acts they had got a hold of
[1:08:38] that word and believed it until it
[1:08:39] produced a mighty Ministry of men and
[1:08:42] woman who who could who could manifest
[1:08:44] the very life of Jesus Christ and he
[1:08:46] said I've seen it do it so I know if I
[1:08:49] just get focused right it'll do it again
[1:08:51] I've seen this Winchester shoot and even
[1:08:54] though the maker of the God says it's
[1:08:56] not going to do it I've seen it do it
[1:08:58] and I know it'll do it again oh and he
[1:09:00] said I've seen this word do it and
[1:09:02] sometimes that's what where we find
[1:09:04] ourselves you find yourselves kneeling
[1:09:06] before the Lord saying Lord what's wrong
[1:09:08] why does my life not seem to be
[1:09:10] manifesting what I know it can but
[1:09:12] there's something about you that you
[1:09:14] know if you ever get your life focused
[1:09:16] right it'll manifest the word for your
[1:09:18] hour it'll manifest Jesus Christ on
[1:09:21] Earth again and so you Toil and you
[1:09:23] labor and you say Lord take it out of me
[1:09:26] Lord take this this this carnal nature
[1:09:29] out of me oh and you're getting your
[1:09:31] life in a focus because you know the
[1:09:33] power of this word you know what it can
[1:09:35] do you've seen it do it in others and
[1:09:37] you say Lord I know if it worked for
[1:09:39] others it'll work for me this word can
[1:09:41] be manifested in my life oh and maybe
[1:09:45] sometimes that's why you find yourself
[1:09:46] in a state of tension and you think
[1:09:48] something's wrong with you maybe a young
[1:09:50] person tonight sometimes you you battle
[1:09:52] with that nervousness and that tension
[1:09:54] and maybe it's not not a bad thing but
[1:09:56] God sometimes allow tension in your life
[1:09:59] because that's what keeps you in line
[1:10:01] that's what keeps you in line with your
[1:10:03] the with the word of God that's what
[1:10:04] keeps you constantly checking up with
[1:10:06] that word saying Lord am I lining up
[1:10:08] right am I focused right focused right
[1:10:12] oh so don't don't let the devil beat you
[1:10:14] up on that all the time amen because God
[1:10:16] may be using it but aren't you thankful
[1:10:19] we have something to focus on are you
[1:10:22] thankful for a word we can focus on you
[1:10:24] know there was was up at Mount
[1:10:25] Transfiguration one time and there was a
[1:10:28] three men up on that mountain Peter
[1:10:30] James and John and they represented hope
[1:10:33] faith and charity and there they were on
[1:10:35] that mountain and they were on that
[1:10:37] mountain with the holy God and there
[1:10:39] they were
[1:10:40] looking and there he was there was God
[1:10:43] on that mountain shining his reignment
[1:10:46] were shining and there they were and all
[1:10:48] of a sudden Moses and Elijah appeared
[1:10:51] and they represented Law And Justice and
[1:10:54] there was Jesus representing God's love
[1:10:56] and so Peter got all excited he said
[1:10:58] let's build three Tabernacles because of
[1:11:01] this special moment and there they were
[1:11:03] getting ready to build three Tabernacles
[1:11:06] but but the thing is that that Moses
[1:11:08] represented the law and the law was only
[1:11:10] a policeman that could put us in jail
[1:11:12] and Justice would would only judge your
[1:11:15] life a and so they were trying to build
[1:11:17] a tabernacle but God had other plans and
[1:11:21] before they could build that Tabernacle
[1:11:23] there come down a cloud and there come
[1:11:25] out a voice that spoke this is my
[1:11:26] beloved Son hear ye him and Peter James
[1:11:30] and John looked again and they didn't
[1:11:31] see Moses and Elijah anymore but they
[1:11:34] saw Jesus only that's the only one they
[1:11:37] saw when they got focused right and
[1:11:39] that's the problem sometimes people come
[1:11:41] into this message and all they see is a
[1:11:43] bunch of Law and a bunch of justice and
[1:11:46] so they fall away and they go back into
[1:11:48] the world say no it's just a bunch of
[1:11:50] rules and regulations but they didn't
[1:11:52] stay long enough to look at the main
[1:11:54] attraction and if you could just look
[1:11:56] again tonight you'll see more than a law
[1:11:59] you'll see more than justice but you'll
[1:12:01] see the love of God reaching out and
[1:12:03] picking up his attributes out of this
[1:12:05] Earth and showing them who they are
[1:12:08] showing you where you came from showing
[1:12:10] you that you were always a part of God
[1:12:13] oh you have a right tonight to look
[1:12:15] again maybe you've looked at this
[1:12:17] message sometimes oh and all it was was
[1:12:19] your parents' religion but look again
[1:12:22] look again and see Jesus only look again
[1:12:25] and see this message is Christ revealed
[1:12:27] in this hour oh what is the attraction
[1:12:30] on the mountain brother Gabriel God is
[1:12:32] fulfilling his word God was fulfilling
[1:12:35] his word up on that that that Mount
[1:12:37] Olive when Jesus come riding down on
[1:12:39] that white donkey it was God fulfilling
[1:12:42] Zechariah 9 and God has been fulfilling
[1:12:45] his word and when Moses was up on that
[1:12:47] mountain God was fulfilling his word and
[1:12:50] he was attracting Moses to something but
[1:12:52] it was more than a sign but Moses was
[1:12:55] attracted by the sign and there begin to
[1:12:57] come a voice out of that sign calling
[1:13:00] them to his purpose oh and there's been
[1:13:02] a lot of signs but God doesn't just send
[1:13:04] signs for no reason he sends signs to
[1:13:07] attract a crowd and when that crowd is
[1:13:09] there there comes a voice that speaks a
[1:13:12] message oh and you were attracted to
[1:13:14] this message maybe some of you Elders
[1:13:16] come in in The Healing Ministry but you
[1:13:19] stuck around long enough to look again
[1:13:21] and see that there was a voice speaking
[1:13:23] out of that message calling you out
[1:13:26] calling you out of denomination calling
[1:13:28] you out of man-made Creeds and dogmas
[1:13:31] and brother it attracted your attention
[1:13:33] that's what we're attracted to tonight
[1:13:35] oh brother Brandon preached the message
[1:13:37] what is the attraction he said I got the
[1:13:39] inspiration when I was driving down the
[1:13:41] street this morning and I saw the
[1:13:43] license plates from all the different
[1:13:45] states he said they come from the east
[1:13:47] and west but there's something about the
[1:13:49] believer you can't help but follow it
[1:13:51] you can't help but follow this word is
[1:13:54] that you can take my life but you can't
[1:13:56] take this this word attracts the bride
[1:13:59] you've been attracted to more than the
[1:14:01] pews more than the color of the carpet
[1:14:04] you've been attracted to God fulfilling
[1:14:06] his word in your day to the Fulfillment
[1:14:10] of Revelation 107 in Luke 17:30 and
[1:14:14] brother when Moses was walking down that
[1:14:16] path he was attracted by that by that
[1:14:19] burning bush and when he was attracted
[1:14:21] to that Burning Bush whatever he was
[1:14:24] doing that day brother Gabriel he was
[1:14:26] distracted he was distracted by from
[1:14:29] whatever he was doing and his only
[1:14:31] attraction was that burning bush and
[1:14:33] sometimes brother when you're attracted
[1:14:35] to something it distracts you from
[1:14:37] everything else and some of you when you
[1:14:39] were out in the world you were attracted
[1:14:41] to sports so much that it distracted you
[1:14:44] from everything else you might have been
[1:14:46] attracted to car so much that it
[1:14:48] distracted you from everything else you
[1:14:51] might have found your girlfriend one day
[1:14:53] and you were so attracted to that it
[1:14:55] distracted you from everything else they
[1:14:57] said oh where where's Gabriel been
[1:14:59] lately oh I don't know he's distracted
[1:15:01] again I haven't heard from him in weeks
[1:15:03] and months because he's found his mate
[1:15:06] oh but brother one day your mate the
[1:15:09] revealed word begin to come in front of
[1:15:11] your eyes and you become attracted to it
[1:15:14] and it distracted you from every other
[1:15:16] voice every other opinion every other
[1:15:19] Creed every other dogma and you begin to
[1:15:22] focus say oh I've got something to focus
[1:15:25] son now oh it's God manifesting his word
[1:15:29] in our
[1:15:30] midst oh it's an attraction to the bride
[1:15:34] this word calls you out and that's what
[1:15:37] you have a right tonight to do is look
[1:15:39] again you see that's what we're talking
[1:15:41] about when we're talking about looking
[1:15:42] on at to to the onse scene it's that
[1:15:45] that that you've got to not focus on the
[1:15:48] symtoms but you got to focus on the word
[1:15:52] like Jonah could be in the belly of the
[1:15:53] well and he could asking Well's belly to
[1:15:55] the left to the right I see Well's belly
[1:15:58] in front of me and behind me but he said
[1:16:00] yet once more will I look again and he
[1:16:03] looked again he said I see by faith
[1:16:05] there's a Temple that was dedicated and
[1:16:07] they said if you would pray the prayer
[1:16:08] of faith that God would deliver you and
[1:16:11] so he called it a lying vanity and he
[1:16:13] looked again and if you're looking at
[1:16:15] your symptoms brother you'll constantly
[1:16:18] be living into feet but you have a right
[1:16:20] to look again and say I see Jesus on a
[1:16:23] cross I see his hands nailed I see blood
[1:16:26] dripping out of his side blood for my
[1:16:29] healing and blood for my salvation and I
[1:16:32] see Isaiah picking up a pen and riding
[1:16:34] he was wounded for my transgressions he
[1:16:37] was bruised for my iniquities the
[1:16:39] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:16:41] and with his stripes I was healed
[1:16:43] there's a lot of power sometimes and
[1:16:45] taking another look cuz the first look
[1:16:47] might be your inward your outward man
[1:16:50] but take another look by that inward man
[1:16:52] and see Jesus see Jesus only in this
[1:16:55] message see the promise of the word oh
[1:16:59] sometimes you got to take another look
[1:17:01] oh and focus on that you see and then
[1:17:04] you have a right to call those things
[1:17:06] which be not as though they are you have
[1:17:09] a right to call that devil a liar
[1:17:11] tonight you have a right like Abraham to
[1:17:14] say I may not see it I may not
[1:17:16] understand it but I'm going to call it a
[1:17:19] as though it already is I'm going to
[1:17:21] call those symptoms as though they're
[1:17:23] not and I'm going to call my healing as
[1:17:25] though it is you see sometimes brother
[1:17:28] and sister it it takes an it takes
[1:17:30] something on your part and and sometimes
[1:17:34] that's why we testify before it's ever
[1:17:36] done because because brother Brown
[1:17:38] taught us that works is Faith expressed
[1:17:41] and he began to lay in this thought that
[1:17:44] that that that Paul wrote about Abraham
[1:17:46] that he was justified by faith and and
[1:17:48] he said how could it be when when James
[1:17:51] wrote about him that he was justified by
[1:17:53] works but he said it's not a
[1:17:55] contradiction it's just that faith and
[1:17:57] works are husband and wife and when
[1:18:00] Abraham believed God that's what God saw
[1:18:03] in him but when he went to acting as
[1:18:06] though it was done that's what man saw
[1:18:08] and our works express our faith in this
[1:18:11] word and as you begin to as God begins
[1:18:14] to reveal to you something then brother
[1:18:16] it's a finished work a and when God
[1:18:19] drops something in your heart now not
[1:18:21] just a hope so but a know so when he
[1:18:23] drops that in your heart like he did for
[1:18:25] Abraham then you have a right to make
[1:18:28] ready for it you see Abraham why didn't
[1:18:30] Abraham just wait until the the
[1:18:33] pregnancy test came back positive to go
[1:18:35] out and buy the little booties and the
[1:18:37] crib and the blankets because there's
[1:18:39] something about faith and works that are
[1:18:41] married together that when Faith drops
[1:18:44] in your heart you can express the works
[1:18:46] of it and those Works God already
[1:18:48] recognized his faith so why would he
[1:18:50] have to do the works so that man could
[1:18:53] see the kind of faith that he had and
[1:18:56] it's a powerful thing to me because
[1:18:58] brother Brandon would pray for a baby
[1:18:59] that had clubbed feet and he would pray
[1:19:01] for him and those club feet were still
[1:19:03] clubbed when he left the service but the
[1:19:06] next day I believe it was he went down
[1:19:07] to the shoe store and he saw daddy in
[1:19:10] there picking out shoes what was it oh
[1:19:13] God may have already seen his faith but
[1:19:15] brother brandom as a man could walk in
[1:19:17] and see his Works expressing his faith
[1:19:20] he said why would why would Mariah Pro
[1:19:22] it had to take her bobby pins in the
[1:19:24] prayer line one night for your healing
[1:19:26] did not God already see your faith that
[1:19:28] maybe so but all the rest of us that
[1:19:31] were there saw the works expressing her
[1:19:33] faith oh and I'm so glad that brother
[1:19:35] Brandon didn't teach us that works is
[1:19:37] feelings expressed but he taught us that
[1:19:39] works is Faith expressed because
[1:19:42] sometimes your works are not expressing
[1:19:43] your feelings but your works are
[1:19:45] expressing your faith oh why are you
[1:19:48] here tonight you had to take work to get
[1:19:50] here is that an expression of your
[1:19:52] feelings or was that an expression of
[1:19:54] Faith oh there was an old man one time
[1:19:57] that was deaf dumb and blind he said why
[1:19:59] do you come to church oh because I just
[1:20:01] want the devil and everybody else to
[1:20:03] know that I believe this oh and
[1:20:05] sometimes that may be the only reason
[1:20:06] you come to church because God may
[1:20:08] already see your faith but sometimes you
[1:20:11] just need to let the devil and everybody
[1:20:12] know that your works are still
[1:20:15] expressing that you believe God that you
[1:20:17] believe he's a Healer that's you believe
[1:20:19] he the deliverer oh you can go to
[1:20:22] praising him in the midst of Trials
[1:20:24] because sometimes your praise is not an
[1:20:27] expression of your feelings but
[1:20:29] sometimes your worship is an expression
[1:20:31] of only your faith because you may not
[1:20:33] see it you may not understand it with
[1:20:36] your natural lies but there's some sort
[1:20:38] of understanding that says it's for me
[1:20:40] and so you begin to praise in the Lord
[1:20:42] you begin to Worship in the Lord because
[1:20:45] you're expressing something in that
[1:20:47] Unseen World that God is here in our
[1:20:50] midst oh you say brother Isaac if I can
[1:20:52] only express to you all the problems
[1:20:55] that I'm going through oh go ahead I'll
[1:20:57] listen but after you're done let's
[1:20:59] Express how big our God is let's Express
[1:21:01] how he's a Healer let's Express how he's
[1:21:04] done it before and he'll do it again oh
[1:21:07] what are you expressing oh i' say if
[1:21:09] this church was expressing their
[1:21:11] feelings I would tune in on Saturday
[1:21:13] night and say here brother Andrew saying
[1:21:15] oh problems problems lots and lots of
[1:21:18] problems but this church must have found
[1:21:21] another thing to express because when
[1:21:23] you tune in you still got the Victory
[1:21:25] you still got your shout you still got
[1:21:28] your dance you must have found another
[1:21:30] way to express because you say oh oh did
[1:21:33] they get a good report is all the trials
[1:21:36] over no brother Ron actually just had a
[1:21:39] heart attack didn't you hear then how
[1:21:41] are they happy then how are they
[1:21:43] Victorious because they're expressing
[1:21:46] something that's dropped in from that
[1:21:47] Unseen World is that God is God and God
[1:21:51] don't ever change and so if he kept them
[1:21:53] this far he can take them all the way
[1:21:55] through oh you have a right to express
[1:21:58] it oh you're not expressing your feeling
[1:22:00] you say I feel like a hypocrite brother
[1:22:02] Isaac oh sometimes you just have to take
[1:22:04] that adopted child and just go to
[1:22:07] thanking the Lord he say I don't feel
[1:22:08] like I have the Revelation just yet well
[1:22:11] just keep thanking him for it just keep
[1:22:13] praising him for it just take that
[1:22:15] adopted child sometimes and before you
[1:22:17] know it God and His grace and mercy
[1:22:20] begin to drop something down into your
[1:22:21] heart and oh there it is now I I can
[1:22:24] express it from my heart oh your Works
[1:22:28] express your
[1:22:29] faith you say the only
[1:22:32] thing if you're expressing your thoughts
[1:22:35] and the only thing you can express is
[1:22:38] problems and situations then you need to
[1:22:41] get your focus right and do what Paul
[1:22:43] said think on these things that which is
[1:22:46] good that which is lovely that which is
[1:22:48] of a good report sometimes you just got
[1:22:51] to change your expression sometimes you
[1:22:53] just got to turn that round upside down
[1:22:55] in the natural that would be great and
[1:22:58] in the spiritual and change what you're
[1:23:00] expressing and live a Victorious Life oh
[1:23:03] why is it so hard to live the Christian
[1:23:05] Life oh sometimes you're looking at the
[1:23:08] wrong thing but you get that Focus back
[1:23:10] right brother and you can begin to
[1:23:12] express oh and it's a paradox the world
[1:23:15] don't understand it why you can be so
[1:23:17] Victorious why you can persevere in the
[1:23:19] midst of hard times but it's because
[1:23:21] you're looking at the
[1:23:23] Unseen you're expressing because you're
[1:23:25] considering not you're considering not
[1:23:28] like Abraham the deadness of Sarah's
[1:23:30] womb or the deadness of your own body
[1:23:33] consider not the circumstances brother
[1:23:35] when God has dropped something in your
[1:23:37] heart you'll no longer consider the
[1:23:39] circumstances but you'll consider the
[1:23:41] promise alone and that's what you'll
[1:23:43] walk by and and if and and and and I
[1:23:47] believe that applies to the spiritual
[1:23:48] but even in the natural maybe there's
[1:23:51] somebody that that's considered the
[1:23:53] deadness in their own womb and that's
[1:23:55] all that they can see and it weighs on
[1:23:57] you night and day because all you want
[1:23:59] is a baby and and this begins to come on
[1:24:02] my heart as I begin to study this
[1:24:04] consider not the deadness of Sarah's
[1:24:06] womb and I think God has given us given
[1:24:09] us so many testimonies of God restoring
[1:24:12] life to the womb we have a little niece
[1:24:15] at home Evelyn that was a product of a
[1:24:17] miracle where God gave a baby to a
[1:24:21] family that was in desperate conditions
[1:24:23] we have testimony back home there's
[1:24:25] testimonies around this world uh brother
[1:24:27] tusher down in
[1:24:29] Louisiana brother and sister Jackson in
[1:24:31] North Carolina because that's if you can
[1:24:35] look at where God's done it before you
[1:24:37] know he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:39] forever and you know it can do it again
[1:24:42] and consider that consider the promise
[1:24:45] consider the testimonies and look not at
[1:24:47] the deadness of your womb look not at
[1:24:50] the deadness of your situation and
[1:24:52] consider the word you see David could go
[1:24:55] into battle and he wasn't considering
[1:24:57] cuz cuz Goliath could look at him how
[1:24:59] old are you young man 10 years old
[1:25:03] Goliath could look at little David and
[1:25:05] Goliath could say oh he's he he's
[1:25:07] nothing but a youth and he's just a
[1:25:10] young man and Goliath Goliath considered
[1:25:13] his youth said he's a young man he's no
[1:25:15] threat to me but David didn't consider
[1:25:17] his Youth and I think that you young
[1:25:19] people tonight the devil may be telling
[1:25:21] you that because you're a young person
[1:25:23] that you don't have access to the
[1:25:25] blessings that the rest of the church
[1:25:26] does but I think you can come to a place
[1:25:28] where you don't consider you youth but
[1:25:30] Paul said let no man despise thy youth
[1:25:32] but be thou an example and I believe God
[1:25:35] can raise up young people to be examples
[1:25:37] examples of Purity examples of
[1:25:39] righteousness examples of the message
[1:25:42] examples of faith in the word of God God
[1:25:45] can raise up young people who won't
[1:25:47] consider their youth God can raise up
[1:25:49] Elders who won't consider their age and
[1:25:51] make you pillars in the house of God and
[1:25:53] break up those complexes from your life
[1:25:55] that everybody's forgotten you nobody
[1:25:58] cares about you stop considering the age
[1:26:00] and only consider the promise and begin
[1:26:03] to rise into your adopted position of
[1:26:05] who you are and who God's called you to
[1:26:07] be oh if he still has you here he must
[1:26:10] still have a purpose for you so you
[1:26:12] don't have to live in the dumps of
[1:26:13] depression and inferiority you can rise
[1:26:16] in the promises of God oh he say what's
[1:26:20] the evidence that it's going to happen
[1:26:22] faith is the evidence say don't see it
[1:26:25] that's not the evidence faith is the
[1:26:27] evidence faith is an act of positive
[1:26:30] faith is a finished work oh and you can
[1:26:33] act on that Faith because we don't walk
[1:26:35] by sight but we walk by
[1:26:38] faith you
[1:26:40] see that's how Abraham could persevere
[1:26:43] was because he walked by faith and not
[1:26:47] by sight you know that's that's what
[1:26:50] brother Brandon would tell us about
[1:26:51] those old hot and tots he said they
[1:26:53] serve the the god of amoya it's the
[1:26:55] Unseen God he said but but a Christian
[1:26:58] just a Christian just doesn't have to
[1:27:00] see something to believe it he said he
[1:27:03] said that that Christians don't have to
[1:27:04] see to believe and he even said about
[1:27:07] these hot and tots that they have to see
[1:27:09] it to believe it he said that's idolatry
[1:27:12] he said to have to see something to
[1:27:14] worship it that's idolatry but as
[1:27:17] Believers we don't have to wait till we
[1:27:19] see it to worship God he said here these
[1:27:21] word these hot and tots they would
[1:27:23] worship the god of amoya until they got
[1:27:26] into a hard situation and they would
[1:27:28] pack around that Idol on their hip to
[1:27:30] break out in the tough times but we are
[1:27:32] not Idol worshippers but we worship the
[1:27:35] invisible God in the good times and in
[1:27:37] the tough times you don't have to see it
[1:27:39] to believe it you don't have to see it
[1:27:41] to worship it but there's something in
[1:27:43] you that worships whether you see it or
[1:27:46] not because even when you don't see it
[1:27:48] he may be working even when you don't
[1:27:50] feel it he may be moving on the scene
[1:27:53] and sometimes you get so focused on the
[1:27:54] flesh Veil that brother the that the
[1:27:57] Lord could be trying to do something in
[1:27:58] the church and all you can see is the
[1:28:00] man and all you can see is your sister
[1:28:03] and all you can see is your brother and
[1:28:05] so you don't receive what God's trying
[1:28:06] to do but look again brother and see the
[1:28:10] Unseen God in this church this is more
[1:28:12] than a gathering of individuals this is
[1:28:14] a gathering of Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:17] and you can look again and realize that
[1:28:19] God is speaking over this Pulpit on
[1:28:21] Sundays and Saturdays and God maybe
[1:28:24] trying to do something in your life if
[1:28:26] you could just stop looking at the flesh
[1:28:28] Veil and realize that God uses man in
[1:28:31] this hour God has no hands but ours God
[1:28:34] has no feet but ours he has no tongue
[1:28:37] but ours he has no ability but he he
[1:28:40] would express it through his bride oh he
[1:28:43] has ability he he he could he could work
[1:28:46] without me but he chose in this hour to
[1:28:49] to to to express himself through a
[1:28:51] bride and sometimes that's where we get
[1:28:54] caught as that traditional Veil but if
[1:28:57] you could ever break through that
[1:28:58] traditional Veil that it has to come the
[1:29:00] way you think and it has to come the way
[1:29:02] you desire and just let God be God let
[1:29:05] the god that we serve be God tonight and
[1:29:09] you begin to break away every
[1:29:10] traditional Veil you begin to break away
[1:29:12] every box of your own idea you begin to
[1:29:15] break away every situation and just say
[1:29:17] God if you want to do something in my
[1:29:19] life have your way oh Lord not my will
[1:29:23] but thine be done
[1:29:25] oh that's the god that we
[1:29:27] serve oh he has so much ability but
[1:29:31] maybe sometimes we just try to let him
[1:29:34] do it our way instead of his
[1:29:38] way Lord help us tonight but but God has
[1:29:41] given us a way to
[1:29:43] persevere and in Hebrews it says
[1:29:45] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:29:47] with the people of God it's talking
[1:29:50] about Moses enduring he said then to
[1:29:52] enjoy the pleasures of sin sin for a
[1:29:54] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:29:57] greater riches than the treasures of
[1:29:59] Egypt for he had respect unto the
[1:30:01] recompense of the
[1:30:03] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:30:06] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:30:08] endured as seeing him who was
[1:30:10] invisible when I read that that just so
[1:30:13] struck my heart that the very Foundation
[1:30:16] of Moses's endurance was that he saw
[1:30:19] something that was
[1:30:20] Invisible Man think about that for a
[1:30:22] second the very Foundation of his walk
[1:30:25] was that he looked and something was
[1:30:28] invisible and it gave him
[1:30:30] perseverance and that doesn't maybe
[1:30:32] compute with the natural mind but I I
[1:30:35] went over and looked at the Amplified
[1:30:36] and it said by faith he left Egypt being
[1:30:39] unafraid of the Wrath of the king for he
[1:30:41] endured steadfastly as seeing him who is
[1:30:44] unseen so here you find that if you can
[1:30:48] just begin to look at the on scene that
[1:30:50] can bring a perseverance in your life
[1:30:52] for Moses said I would choose rather to
[1:30:54] suffer Affliction H with the people of
[1:30:57] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[1:30:59] for a season and he had something about
[1:31:01] him I would rather suffer I would rather
[1:31:04] suffer with those uh Hebrews out in the
[1:31:07] mud pits than to enjoy the pleasures of
[1:31:09] sin for a season and if you're living in
[1:31:12] for the pleasures of sin then then it'll
[1:31:15] be a very short season and The Season's
[1:31:18] almost over but Moses had a different
[1:31:20] way to look he was looking at the on
[1:31:22] scene and he said I would rather choose
[1:31:24] to suffer Affliction I would rather take
[1:31:27] the trials and the hard times I would
[1:31:29] rather walk with God in the midst of
[1:31:32] difficulty than enjoy the pleasures of
[1:31:34] sin for a season and it brought an
[1:31:36] endurance in his life and he said I
[1:31:37] would rather esteem the reproach and I
[1:31:40] esteem it Greater riches than the
[1:31:42] treasures of Egypt he could look out
[1:31:44] there at the palace of pharaoh he could
[1:31:46] see the king and the kingship he could
[1:31:48] see the throne he could see great years
[1:31:50] ahead uh if he would go down that road
[1:31:54] but he could look farther than that and
[1:31:56] see in the future that Egypt would be in
[1:31:59] Desolation but he looked farther and he
[1:32:01] said though I see the future of Egypt he
[1:32:04] was looking out the same window that
[1:32:05] Pharaoh looked at but he saw something
[1:32:08] different he saw Christ in those mud
[1:32:10] pits and those men he said I'm not
[1:32:12] ashamed to regard my position as a
[1:32:14] Hebrew instead of an Egyptian I'm not
[1:32:17] ashamed to be one of them I'm not
[1:32:19] ashamed to take on the reproach of a
[1:32:20] Hebrew I'm not ashamed to be called a
[1:32:23] children of Israel I'm not ashamed to
[1:32:25] suffer I'm not ashamed to take on the
[1:32:28] reproach because he could look out that
[1:32:30] window and he could see the future of
[1:32:32] Egypt may have been bright for a few
[1:32:34] years but that's all it was but he could
[1:32:36] look and he could see the children of
[1:32:38] Israel gathered around the throne with
[1:32:40] faithful Abraham and that's what he
[1:32:42] looked at and by looking at the on scene
[1:32:44] you can realize tonight that America
[1:32:46] will be blown into craters and Ashes but
[1:32:49] you look a little farther and you see
[1:32:51] the bride gathered around the Throne of
[1:32:53] God God and that brings an endurance in
[1:32:55] your life that brings a perseverance in
[1:32:57] your life he said I would rather look to
[1:33:00] those greater Treasures than the
[1:33:02] treasures of Egypt and Moses looked out
[1:33:04] that window brother and he didn't just
[1:33:06] sympathize with them and say oh those
[1:33:08] are great people my those Hebrews are
[1:33:11] wonderful people my I sure appreciate
[1:33:13] them I'm going to go back to my nice
[1:33:15] comfy chair no he worked out that window
[1:33:17] and he said I want I'm going to become
[1:33:19] one of them I'm not ashamed to regard my
[1:33:21] place in those mud pits I'm not ashamed
[1:33:24] to take on the name of Christianity and
[1:33:26] bear the reproach of it because I see
[1:33:29] past it that there's coming a reward and
[1:33:31] brother brandom could choose the harder
[1:33:33] way but it was God's way and God could
[1:33:36] say there's a great portion of Heaven
[1:33:38] that awaits you little bride you that
[1:33:40] persevere you that look to the on scene
[1:33:42] keep pressing keep pressing the battle
[1:33:44] you see I could come and admonish you as
[1:33:47] a human being but if you could look to
[1:33:49] that on scene and see those hosts of
[1:33:52] saints that have gone on before you
[1:33:54] telling you to persevere keep pressing
[1:33:56] the battle it won't be long now keep
[1:33:59] pressing persevere don't look back don't
[1:34:02] look to the left or to the right Joshua
[1:34:04] stay with the commission stay with the
[1:34:06] word oh and brother brand would say what
[1:34:09] could be a greater treasure than the new
[1:34:11] birth and there's something about the
[1:34:13] believer he's not ashamed to be called a
[1:34:16] Believer he's not ashamed of the new
[1:34:18] birth he's not ashamed of when the on
[1:34:21] scene comes on the scene and begins to
[1:34:24] speak to his heart and drop a revelation
[1:34:27] out of that mystical Channel and begin
[1:34:29] to reveal to him who he is and where he
[1:34:31] came from and where he's going he's not
[1:34:33] ashamed of the effects of the Unseen
[1:34:35] World that'll make him weep and cry and
[1:34:38] Shout Moses wasn't ashamed Moses Moses
[1:34:41] was willing to esteem the reproach
[1:34:44] greater
[1:34:45] treasure and there's something I'm
[1:34:47] willing I'm not ashamed of this message
[1:34:50] I'm not ashamed to take on the reproach
[1:34:52] of this message I can consider it a
[1:34:54] greater treasure you could cut off my
[1:34:56] head you could kill me but whether I die
[1:34:59] or whether I live there's something
[1:35:00] about you that says I'm not going to
[1:35:02] quit I'm not going to back up I'm not
[1:35:04] going to give up or whether I get
[1:35:06] persecuted and made fun of or laughed at
[1:35:09] there's something about me I'm looking
[1:35:10] to something else I'm looking to the on
[1:35:12] scene that God has got a bride and to
[1:35:15] know that he loves me to know that he's
[1:35:17] proud of me for staying with his word to
[1:35:20] know that he loves me enough to send me
[1:35:22] a message there's something in my heart
[1:35:24] that says Lord I'll receive it I'll keep
[1:35:27] it pure as long as you give me Grace
[1:35:29] I'll stand for it I won't back down I
[1:35:32] won't be ashamed of this Holy Ghost I
[1:35:34] won't be ashamed of any word in this
[1:35:36] Bible I won't be ashamed of anything
[1:35:38] that brother brandom taught oh I'm
[1:35:40] focused on this message I've been
[1:35:42] attracted to it and all other
[1:35:44] distractions have gone aside I'm not
[1:35:46] looking to the right or to the left I'm
[1:35:48] looking to the Unseen I'm looking to
[1:35:51] Heaven brother I'm looking to Eternity
[1:35:53] with God I'm looking to a Rapture I'm
[1:35:55] looking to a millennium I'm looking to a
[1:35:57] future home and it won't come to a bunch
[1:36:00] of hybrid uh halfway Christians but it's
[1:36:04] coming to a people who are willing to
[1:36:06] persevere who are willing to believe God
[1:36:08] and take him out his word oh that's what
[1:36:11] it is it's calling you to a higher plane
[1:36:13] calling you to perseverance by looking
[1:36:15] at the on scene and remember remember
[1:36:18] who you're walking with you're not
[1:36:20] walking with with the with a with a with
[1:36:23] just a a a a God that's that's just
[1:36:26] shows up on Sundays and Saturdays and
[1:36:28] and just a God that's just painted
[1:36:31] pretty and a in a church somewhere but
[1:36:32] you're walking with the Unseen one
[1:36:35] you're walking with the one that Abraham
[1:36:36] walked with you're walking with the one
[1:36:38] that Enoch walked with you're walking
[1:36:40] with the one that Adam and Eve walked
[1:36:42] with you're walking with him and he's
[1:36:43] the Unseen guest he's the Unseen guest
[1:36:46] in our homes he's the Unseen guest in
[1:36:48] his services oh there's a lot going on
[1:36:51] in that Unseen World that we don't
[1:36:52] always realize there's Angels encamped
[1:36:54] about those that fear Him oh but
[1:36:57] sometimes you may not see it but God saw
[1:36:59] fit one time to show gazi and open his
[1:37:02] eyes Elijah was used to walking by the
[1:37:04] Unseen so he knew they were there but
[1:37:07] one time in Dothan God opened gazi's
[1:37:10] eyes and he could see the host of unseen
[1:37:12] forces all around him there's Angels
[1:37:14] encamped about us oh that's not just
[1:37:17] something that we say that's not just
[1:37:19] something that we pray over our children
[1:37:20] at night that's something that we
[1:37:22] believe that's something that we live by
[1:37:24] that's something that if you really
[1:37:26] believe it you can believe that they
[1:37:27] follow you to your car when you go to
[1:37:29] work you can believe that they watch
[1:37:31] over your children when they lay down to
[1:37:32] sleep and when they go to school oh in
[1:37:35] that Unseen World it's more real than
[1:37:37] anything you see with your natural lie
[1:37:40] and brother Brown said one day it'll
[1:37:41] become just as common as television
[1:37:44] because television was always there but
[1:37:46] it took something to pick it up and
[1:37:48] channel it he said one day these things
[1:37:50] will become just as common it'll become
[1:37:52] just as common to see angels as it is to
[1:37:55] watch the television it'll become just
[1:37:57] as common to see your loved ones appear
[1:37:59] among you as it will be to turn on a
[1:38:01] light switch one of these days that
[1:38:03] Unseen World will become so close it'll
[1:38:06] become just as common as what you see
[1:38:08] with your natural eye oh but I don't
[1:38:10] believe we have to wait until then I
[1:38:12] believe because you're a candidate for
[1:38:14] it it be can become to start becoming
[1:38:16] now it can become more common to you now
[1:38:19] it can become more common for angels to
[1:38:21] visit your home than television shows it
[1:38:24] can become more common for you to get
[1:38:26] down on your knees and pray for the
[1:38:28] situation than to pick up the phone and
[1:38:30] gossip about it it can become more
[1:38:32] common for you to begin to connect with
[1:38:34] that Unseen World you're a candidate for
[1:38:36] it but sometimes it loses its commonness
[1:38:39] but look back to the Unseen and let this
[1:38:42] word become common to you let the power
[1:38:44] of God become common to you oh you may
[1:38:46] have lost the joy of your salvation it
[1:38:48] may not mean you're not saved but the
[1:38:50] commonness has left you but I pray God
[1:38:52] restore joy in your heart tonight that
[1:38:55] it'll become just as common as it ever
[1:38:57] was for you to feel the presence of God
[1:39:00] for you to feel the promises of God
[1:39:02] encouraging your heart oh you say I've
[1:39:04] been coming to church for a long time
[1:39:05] brother Isaac and I just haven't felt
[1:39:07] the Lord but I pray God let the
[1:39:09] commonness of that Unseen World be
[1:39:12] restored in your life oh and you may not
[1:39:15] always see it but may you feel that it's
[1:39:17] there may you feel that God's with you
[1:39:19] he said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:39:21] you I'll be with you even in you Lo I'll
[1:39:24] be with you always never forget who's in
[1:39:26] that ship with you brother oh you say I
[1:39:28] don't see it all I see is a mud ship but
[1:39:31] oh if you're a Believer tonight I see
[1:39:32] more than a mud ship I see Christ in the
[1:39:35] mud ship and when the on scene comes on
[1:39:37] the scene brother things can change
[1:39:39] things can turn
[1:39:40] around
[1:39:42] oh may it become common to us that
[1:39:46] you're walking with the Unseen
[1:39:49] one and you may say tonight we would see
[1:39:53] Jesus
[1:39:54] that's what we're talking about we're
[1:39:57] talking about that unseen
[1:39:59] one Jesus there was some in the Bible
[1:40:03] one time that said we would see
[1:40:06] Jesus and there was philli and Andrew
[1:40:10] there were some disciples that said all
[1:40:12] right and they confir get conferred
[1:40:14] together and they begin to take them to
[1:40:16] Jesus and they had a desire to see him
[1:40:18] but they didn't just want to know where
[1:40:20] he
[1:40:21] lived they didn't just want to know what
[1:40:23] he at for supper that said we want to
[1:40:25] see Jesus and to know him as life we
[1:40:28] want to see him we want to see Jesus and
[1:40:32] and so those disciples Andrew and
[1:40:33] Phillip they took him into the presence
[1:40:36] of Jesus and there he was and he didn't
[1:40:38] say oh yeah you finally recognized it
[1:40:42] I'm the man this is my I'm the Messiah
[1:40:45] this is my kingdom that I'm building
[1:40:48] welcome to welcome to to the great
[1:40:50] domain that that I'm building but he
[1:40:52] said except a corn of wheat fall on the
[1:40:55] ground and die it won't live again he
[1:40:58] said if you want to see me it's going to
[1:41:00] require death you're going to have to
[1:41:02] die out to yourself he was speaking of
[1:41:04] something he was speaking of Calvary he
[1:41:06] was speaking of a place that you could
[1:41:08] come and you could see Jesus but it
[1:41:10] wouldn't come through a Creed it
[1:41:12] wouldn't come through religion it would
[1:41:14] come to dying out to yourself and being
[1:41:16] born again and becoming a candidate that
[1:41:19] God would give you eyes to see say we
[1:41:21] would see Jesus all right except corn of
[1:41:23] wheat fall in the ground and die it'll
[1:41:25] abide alone he was speaking of Calvary
[1:41:27] for he said if I live for myself then
[1:41:30] that'll be the end of it but if I die
[1:41:32] and if I go and plant my corn of weed in
[1:41:34] the ground it'll bring forth a a hundred
[1:41:36] and if you plant a 100 it'll bring forth
[1:41:38] a thousand and so there was Jesus there
[1:41:41] he was in their midst he said but I've
[1:41:43] got to plant this corn of wheat in the
[1:41:44] ground and he is speaking also of his
[1:41:47] church that there would come forth a
[1:41:48] first church and it would be wonderful
[1:41:51] but he was going to have to plant it in
[1:41:52] the ground through through the Dark Ages
[1:41:54] that it would rise again and be restored
[1:41:56] in this last age because there was going
[1:41:58] to be a people in this last age that
[1:41:59] would desire to see him and says I'm
[1:42:01] going to plant my church in the ground
[1:42:03] but I'm not going to leave it there I'm
[1:42:05] going to let it rise and one of these
[1:42:07] days I'm going to have a group of people
[1:42:08] it's a ye class of people that will see
[1:42:11] me brother BR said I believe we can see
[1:42:13] him he said if those disciples could
[1:42:15] take them to him in that hour they can
[1:42:17] do it today he said I believe we can see
[1:42:20] him but Jesus Christ come on the earth
[1:42:22] and brother his first coming there he
[1:42:25] was he he was he was born after he was
[1:42:28] he was born after that Spirit nature God
[1:42:30] was a spirit but he thought it not
[1:42:32] robbery to to be equal with God but he
[1:42:35] also thought it not not unfitting to
[1:42:37] take on the form of a man and so he took
[1:42:40] that Spirit man and he put it inside of
[1:42:42] that flesh man and there was John the
[1:42:44] Baptist on the scene at the time and
[1:42:46] identified him and said Behold the Lamb
[1:42:49] of God that takes away the sin of the
[1:42:51] world you see he's an invisible God
[1:42:53] but he come and he took on and Jesus
[1:42:56] Christ became the image of the invisible
[1:42:58] God he became God in Mor and John the
[1:43:01] Baptist under the spirit of Elijah
[1:43:02] identified him here is that lamb you see
[1:43:05] he's an invisible God but he's an
[1:43:07] identified God he's an identified Christ
[1:43:10] throughout all ages he was identified in
[1:43:12] the pillar of fire he was identifi
[1:43:14] identified in the shukan glory and so
[1:43:17] here he was and though he was persecuted
[1:43:20] and laughed at and made fun of he was
[1:43:22] fulfilled ing every scripture that was
[1:43:24] spoken over him the lame walked the
[1:43:26] blind saw the deaf heard the dead were
[1:43:29] raised again here was Jesus Christ in
[1:43:31] flesh fulfilling the word and there was
[1:43:33] a group of people that recognized him
[1:43:36] there was a Peter that recognized he was
[1:43:37] the Christ there was a woman at the well
[1:43:39] that recognized him there was Nathaniel
[1:43:42] that recognized him there was a group of
[1:43:44] people that recognized him and he said
[1:43:46] oh but I've got to go plant this corn of
[1:43:48] wheat in the ground but I will not leave
[1:43:50] you comfortless I will come again onto
[1:43:52] you the world won't see me anymore but
[1:43:55] ye shall see me and he begin to tell us
[1:43:57] that there would be a ye class of people
[1:43:59] that there would be a ye class in every
[1:44:01] age in every generation those that would
[1:44:03] desire to see him those that would have
[1:44:05] eyes to see he said the world won't see
[1:44:08] me that's the unbeliever you could put
[1:44:10] me right in front of them and they still
[1:44:11] won't see me but there will be a group
[1:44:13] of ye there will be a group of people
[1:44:15] who aren't interested in politics and
[1:44:18] churchianity and a bunch of rules but
[1:44:20] they're interested in seeing Jesus
[1:44:22] they've got a desire I want to see him
[1:44:24] and it said ye shall see me I will not
[1:44:27] leave you comfortless but I will come
[1:44:29] again unto you and I'll be with you even
[1:44:31] in you oh and here he came and here he
[1:44:34] came and he said I'll be with you and
[1:44:36] here comes his second coming he sent
[1:44:38] back a spirit on the day of Pentecost
[1:44:40] and he buried that corn of wheat through
[1:44:42] the Dark Ages but here he comes to his
[1:44:44] second coming and God once again becomes
[1:44:47] in morphe and in morphe means that the
[1:44:50] Unseen was made visible so that you
[1:44:52] could could see it it was God invisible
[1:44:55] but he took on the form of something so
[1:44:58] that we could understand it so that we
[1:45:00] could see it oh and there was a group of
[1:45:02] people that saw him in Jesus but he said
[1:45:04] oh I'm coming on the scene again in a
[1:45:06] bride body and I'm going to be God in
[1:45:08] Moray again I'm going to change my mask
[1:45:11] but there will be a group of ye that are
[1:45:13] going to see me and there is a bride on
[1:45:15] the Earth today that is the image of the
[1:45:17] invisible God because we had an Elijah
[1:45:20] that stood here on this Earth say who is
[1:45:22] that man standing between me and the
[1:45:24] sister that tells her where she lives
[1:45:26] and what's wrong with her it was more
[1:45:28] than brother brandom there was an unseen
[1:45:31] one that had come in the midst of the
[1:45:33] Church of the Living God and brother
[1:45:35] brandham could stand there and identify
[1:45:36] who is this MDC he could identify him in
[1:45:39] the pillar of fire he could identify him
[1:45:41] in the cloud and say that's my Lord up
[1:45:44] there and then he could turn around and
[1:45:46] say the word wants to be made flesh in
[1:45:49] your flesh and I identify Jesus Christ
[1:45:52] he deity is not in heaven but deity is
[1:45:55] in you and Brother brandom come on the
[1:45:57] scene and identified Jesus Christ is
[1:46:00] here again on the scene in a bride body
[1:46:03] oh he's picked up flesh again there
[1:46:05] brother brandom stood and he said when
[1:46:08] Jesus come on the scene three stars
[1:46:10] aligned declaring the birth of an infant
[1:46:13] king of an infant savior but in 1962 he
[1:46:17] declared five stars have just aligned
[1:46:19] what's it declaring it's declaring that
[1:46:21] there's an infant bride on the earth
[1:46:23] there is a bride I have a tabernacle
[1:46:26] they're going to be the image of the
[1:46:28] invisible
[1:46:30] God oh but what was he doing he said
[1:46:33] just like Dothan just like Elijah at
[1:46:36] Dothan there had to be a change of
[1:46:39] seeing I'm saying I'm trying to get to
[1:46:41] you to see that the god that always was
[1:46:43] still is that the God that was in the
[1:46:45] Old Testament Jehovah of the old is
[1:46:48] Jesus in the new he said I'm trying to
[1:46:50] get the people to see that he's still
[1:46:53] here that he's the same yesterday today
[1:46:55] and forever that you can still see him
[1:46:57] that you can still know him that you can
[1:46:59] still walk with him and talk with him
[1:47:01] that you can still fellowship with him
[1:47:04] it's it's Elohim materializing in his
[1:47:06] attributes and I believe that I'm one of
[1:47:09] those attributes I believe that you're
[1:47:11] one of those attributes and Elohim begin
[1:47:14] to condescend and materialize in his
[1:47:17] attributes so that this message could be
[1:47:19] more than with us this message can be in
[1:47:22] you
[1:47:24] oh this message can live inside of you
[1:47:27] this message can be
[1:47:30] tabernacled in hearts and lives today
[1:47:33] and you're a candidate for association
[1:47:35] with the Rapture you're a candidate for
[1:47:37] association with the third poll you're a
[1:47:40] candidate for association with that
[1:47:41] Unseen World you which have the Holy
[1:47:44] Ghost tonight oh why you don't have to
[1:47:46] cry you can speak because it's in you
[1:47:49] it's in you to do it he said I'll be
[1:47:51] with you even in you and when it's in
[1:47:53] you there's a lot of power in that
[1:47:55] because he said greater is he that's in
[1:47:57] you than he that's in the world you want
[1:47:59] to be an overcomer tonight recognize
[1:48:01] who's inside of you and you can start to
[1:48:03] realize that it's greater than he that's
[1:48:05] in the world he that is in me you see
[1:48:08] brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:48:10] science said the Bumblebee shouldn't be
[1:48:12] able to fly but he said it's a good
[1:48:13] thing the Bumblebee didn't know what
[1:48:15] science was saying about him because he
[1:48:17] flew anyhow that bumblebee wasn't
[1:48:19] listening to the voice of the devil that
[1:48:21] bumblebee wasn't listening to the father
[1:48:23] of lies and so he got up and took wings
[1:48:25] and flew anyhow and that's the problem
[1:48:28] you begin to focus out the LIE of the
[1:48:30] devil telling you that you can't fly
[1:48:32] telling you that you can't make it
[1:48:34] telling you that the Rapture is not for
[1:48:35] you telling you that the Holy Ghost
[1:48:37] isn't for you oh brother but the
[1:48:39] believer has the ability to focus only
[1:48:41] on the word of God and you can fly
[1:48:44] anyhow you can fly out of your condition
[1:48:46] tonight you can fly out of the deepest
[1:48:48] darkest trials tonight because it's in
[1:48:51] you to do it it was in the Bumblebee to
[1:48:53] fly no matter what science said oh and
[1:48:56] it's a good thing sometimes we don't
[1:48:58] know what science says about us it was a
[1:49:00] good thing that sister Elena didn't know
[1:49:02] what science said about her or if she
[1:49:04] knew then she didn't care because she
[1:49:07] went ahead and she became cancer-free
[1:49:09] anyhow it's a good thing that
[1:49:11] Congressman Upshaw wasn't paying
[1:49:13] attention to what science said about him
[1:49:15] because he walked anyhow it's a good
[1:49:17] thing that you got a pastor and you got
[1:49:20] a group of Believers in front of me that
[1:49:22] aren't worried about what science says
[1:49:24] because you're here anyhow maybe you
[1:49:26] shouldn't be here but you are anyhow
[1:49:28] because you're looking to the Unseen
[1:49:30] you're looking to the promise you're
[1:49:32] looking to the word of testimony and
[1:49:34] you're expressing your heart towards God
[1:49:37] that I believe you anyhow I don't care
[1:49:40] what science says I don't care what the
[1:49:42] devil says I'm an overcomer and I'm
[1:49:44] going to fly anyhow I'm going to rise
[1:49:47] out of my condition oh I don't know who
[1:49:49] told you you could not make it I don't
[1:49:51] know who told you you could not take it
[1:49:54] but it wasn't Jesus it must have been
[1:49:56] the devil and so don't focus on that
[1:49:59] focus on the word of God and let the
[1:50:01] promise of God be your ceiling oh and
[1:50:04] you keep rising and you can fly brother
[1:50:07] you can fly out of every situation you
[1:50:09] can fly out of every dark every dark
[1:50:12] hole you see sometimes there's things in
[1:50:14] you that you don't realize sometimes you
[1:50:16] have abilities that you don't even know
[1:50:19] and sometimes if you take a record and
[1:50:21] you put a needle on that record brother
[1:50:23] it'll bring forth beautiful music but
[1:50:25] you can't see that music you can only
[1:50:28] hear it and so if you're just looking at
[1:50:29] that record then then you're you're not
[1:50:32] going to even know what lays inside of
[1:50:34] it that's a pretty record but but what
[1:50:37] kind of music does it play and there's
[1:50:39] sometimes where you're in life and
[1:50:42] sometimes you think that it's not in you
[1:50:44] and so you get so discouraged like
[1:50:46] you're trying to learn an instrument and
[1:50:48] sometimes it gets discouraging trying to
[1:50:50] learn an instrument and you think is is
[1:50:52] this all it's ever going to sound like
[1:50:54] is this all I'm ever going to be able to
[1:50:56] play is this is it always going to sound
[1:50:58] like a dead duck is this all it's ever
[1:51:00] going to amount to and then your
[1:51:01] neighbor picks up the instrument and it
[1:51:03] sounds so good like my why can't I do
[1:51:05] that why can't I sound like that why
[1:51:08] can't why can't I play like that and so
[1:51:10] you give up and you and you quit because
[1:51:13] you think this is all it's ever going to
[1:51:14] be but there's something about an
[1:51:17] instrument that you must realize that
[1:51:20] God is not calling you you see you have
[1:51:22] attributes in you just like God had
[1:51:24] attributes to be healer and savior and
[1:51:27] deliverer God's made you with attributes
[1:51:29] to sing and to preach and to and to love
[1:51:32] the scenery and to love to bake and to
[1:51:34] love to cook but sometimes the devil
[1:51:36] gets you so down and so discouraged that
[1:51:39] you can't express the real you because
[1:51:41] you're so tormented by depression and
[1:51:43] anxiety and the devil's trying to play
[1:51:45] his music through your life but what was
[1:51:48] already recorded on the record that's
[1:51:50] the identification that's the true you
[1:51:52] and and God has the the right needle to
[1:51:55] play out that music from your life but
[1:51:57] what you can realize is you are not ever
[1:51:58] supposed to be the musician you were
[1:52:00] only ever supposed to be the instrument
[1:52:02] and so you get frustrated trying to play
[1:52:04] the music out of your life but you're
[1:52:06] not the musician yield yourself as an
[1:52:08] instrument of righteousness into the
[1:52:10] hands of God and let him bring forth
[1:52:12] that music out of your life let him
[1:52:14] bring forth the the precious music of
[1:52:16] the real you oh and then you get up in
[1:52:18] church and start singing you start
[1:52:20] getting up in church and Clapping Your
[1:52:22] Hands and it was the real you all along
[1:52:24] but you just had to yield yourself you
[1:52:26] say oh sometimes I'm scared to yield
[1:52:28] myself because I don't know what I'm
[1:52:29] going to do uh you you don't have to
[1:52:32] know you might go to shouting your
[1:52:34] neighbor might go to dancing your other
[1:52:36] neighbor may go to preaching your other
[1:52:38] neighbor may go to being a wonderful
[1:52:39] housewife but don't worry so much about
[1:52:41] what you're going to do when you start
[1:52:43] yielding just worry about yielding and
[1:52:45] let the master musician get a hold of
[1:52:48] your violin and begin to play a
[1:52:50] masterpiece out of your life begin to
[1:52:52] play the true identity of who you are oh
[1:52:55] you say brother Isaac but there's so
[1:52:57] many things holding me back there's so
[1:52:59] many barriers if you only knew what my
[1:53:02] daddy was like if you only knew what my
[1:53:04] mama was like Daddy abused this one mama
[1:53:07] had this problem Daddy smok Daddy drank
[1:53:10] and there's all these barriers holding
[1:53:12] you back they're unseen barriers you
[1:53:14] can't see them but they're very real
[1:53:17] they're very real that depression it's
[1:53:19] very real but you can't see it but it's
[1:53:21] a barrier in your life but but there's
[1:53:23] something about those barriers you know
[1:53:25] that they could train elephants and and
[1:53:27] when they're very young they could put a
[1:53:29] a heavy chain on their
[1:53:30] leg and they could try to pull against
[1:53:32] that chain and pull against against it
[1:53:35] and they could never break
[1:53:37] away and when they get older brother
[1:53:40] they could pull against a little piece
[1:53:41] of twine and feel a little bit of
[1:53:43] resistance and give up even so much till
[1:53:46] three elephants died in a circus fire
[1:53:49] because they thought that they were held
[1:53:51] down when they could have so easily
[1:53:53] broke that chain you know there's
[1:53:55] something brother Gabriel you can go and
[1:53:57] there's actually there's something that
[1:53:59] they they tell us about about training
[1:54:01] fleas that you can take those fleas and
[1:54:04] you can put them in a jar and they'll
[1:54:06] jump out of that jar so easily but you
[1:54:08] put a lid on that jar and they leave
[1:54:10] that lid on there for three days and
[1:54:12] brother at the end of those three days
[1:54:14] you can take that lid off and those
[1:54:15] fleas will never jump higher than that
[1:54:17] lid was and you know what it's got such
[1:54:20] a bondage over them that even their off
[1:54:22] spring won't ever jump any higher than
[1:54:24] that height of that lid ever was you
[1:54:26] know you can train you can try to help a
[1:54:28] chicken Peck out of that egg but that's
[1:54:30] not the natural way the best way for a
[1:54:33] chicken to be born is to Peck out
[1:54:34] himself and you can try to do it but
[1:54:37] brother you'll mess up their development
[1:54:39] you'll mess up the development of their
[1:54:40] children and they'll become an
[1:54:44] offspring of of challenged chickens uh
[1:54:47] uh poor developed chickens but brother
[1:54:50] you could be held under that bondage
[1:54:52] under that barrier thinking that this is
[1:54:53] all it's ever going to be tugging
[1:54:55] against that chain tugging against that
[1:54:57] weight over your life of past mistakes
[1:55:00] and failures but we had a man one time
[1:55:03] and they put him in a place and they put
[1:55:05] him in there and they tried to seal him
[1:55:06] in there for three days brother Gabriel
[1:55:08] and there was no man-made intervention
[1:55:10] but they put that stone over that cave
[1:55:13] over that tomb and they had it locked in
[1:55:15] there there was no way he could get out
[1:55:17] but because of divine intervention there
[1:55:19] was an unseen one that come on the scene
[1:55:22] and he broke out of that tomb oh no no
[1:55:24] tomb could hold him no barrier could
[1:55:27] hold him no lid could hold him and after
[1:55:29] 3 days he didn't just lay there as a
[1:55:31] dead man anymore but he broke out of
[1:55:34] that tomb and he said because I live you
[1:55:36] shall live also and I'm breeding forth
[1:55:38] an offspring of Overcomers who will not
[1:55:41] be limited by barriers of this world but
[1:55:44] they'll be only limited oh to to to my
[1:55:48] word oh I'm bringing forth an offspring
[1:55:51] of
[1:55:53] Overcomers I'll breed back a people who
[1:55:56] will stay with every word I'll breed
[1:55:58] back a people who will break through
[1:56:00] every barrier I'll breed back a people
[1:56:02] who will look to the on scene I'll breed
[1:56:05] back a people who will not be limited
[1:56:07] I'll breed back of people who will break
[1:56:10] through that sound barrier and come into
[1:56:12] the place where all things are
[1:56:16] possible nothing is too hard for my
[1:56:19] God as the musicians come
[1:56:27] you you you sometimes feel like he's
[1:56:31] left
[1:56:32] you you know there's a forgotten
[1:56:35] beatitude brother Bram tells us
[1:56:38] about and it's John was in a prison and
[1:56:43] he got offended at the Lord why are
[1:56:45] things not going the way I thought they
[1:56:47] would
[1:56:48] be but there was a a beatitude blessed
[1:56:51] is he who is not offending to me and
[1:56:54] sometimes you think the Lord's left
[1:56:56] you sometimes you think the Lord's
[1:56:58] forgotten you and sometimes you even
[1:57:01] forget his
[1:57:02] beatitude but he hasn't forgotten you
[1:57:06] and sometimes you think he's so
[1:57:08] far but sometimes he's just asleep in
[1:57:12] the
[1:57:13] boat sometimes he was there all the time
[1:57:17] and sometimes it may not be that he he
[1:57:20] forsook you but sometimes maybe we
[1:57:22] forsake Him we leave him in the boat
[1:57:24] sleeping and those disciples would say
[1:57:27] did it ever Dawn on you that he's been
[1:57:29] in the boat the whole time did it ever
[1:57:32] Dawn on you that he's here did it ever
[1:57:34] Dawn on you that he he's there and he
[1:57:38] just wants to be woken up he's just
[1:57:40] waiting on somebody to wake him up and
[1:57:43] and how do I wake him up brother Isaac
[1:57:46] by believing his word by by taking him
[1:57:49] at his word faith brings him on the
[1:57:53] scene he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:57:55] forsake you I'll never I'll never you
[1:57:58] see sometimes you're focused on the
[1:58:00] trial so much that it looks like God's
[1:58:03] mad at you or God's angry at you but
[1:58:06] like that picture of the cloud that that
[1:58:08] look like Angry clouds if you just get a
[1:58:11] little closer it looks like angel wings
[1:58:14] beating together you you you have the
[1:58:17] ability tonight to look again you say
[1:58:18] brother Isaac it looks like a great
[1:58:20] trial you know it may be blessed
[1:58:22] blessings and
[1:58:23] disguising you know what looks like more
[1:58:26] more trials and more testings could be
[1:58:28] because God has more confidence in you
[1:58:31] than maybe you
[1:58:32] realized if we could get our Focus right
[1:58:36] and let it become just as Cal and get if
[1:58:39] you could get that channel cleared out
[1:58:41] that
[1:58:42] channel of complexes and and weights and
[1:58:46] and symptoms that you've looked at and
[1:58:49] and get it cleared out and and just let
[1:58:52] that let it become so
[1:58:55] common I believe that the Lord can
[1:58:57] restore the commonness of his presence I
[1:59:00] believe the Lord can can Co so come on
[1:59:02] the scene in the darkest of
[1:59:04] hours and sometimes it feels like your
[1:59:07] darkest hour but his presence always
[1:59:09] brings new hopes and as long as you can
[1:59:13] recognize that his presence is here
[1:59:14] tonight there's still hope there's still
[1:59:17] hope for your situation there's still
[1:59:20] hope for your sick there's still hope
[1:59:23] for your loved ones there's still hope
[1:59:27] when that when that on scene comes on
[1:59:28] the
[1:59:29] scene so if you believe
[1:59:32] it if we could just see what the prophet
[1:59:36] said about
[1:59:38] Abraham Abraham believed it and God saw
[1:59:42] his faith but he didn't just stop there
[1:59:46] he made ready for
[1:59:47] it you say I believe it tonight brother
[1:59:50] Isaac
[1:59:52] well you have a right to make ready for
[1:59:54] it here brother brandom could
[1:59:57] say it is a lesson to us to look to what
[2:00:00] Abraham did not only did he believe it
[2:00:03] but he made ready for it he made
[2:00:05] preparations this child that he saw by
[2:00:08] faith 25 years before the child ever
[2:00:10] come he had considered that he who told
[2:00:13] him was able to keep the promise that he
[2:00:14] had told him he didn't consider any of
[2:00:17] his nature being hundred years old his
[2:00:20] physical being he didn't did not he
[2:00:22] consider at all the deadness of the womb
[2:00:25] of his wife Sarah and the writer of the
[2:00:27] Divine commentary tells us that he
[2:00:29] staggered not at the promise of God
[2:00:30] through unbelief but was strong giving
[2:00:33] glory to God and brother brand tells us
[2:00:35] in works as Faith
[2:00:37] expressed says I it says his words I
[2:00:40] know it's the truth it's God's word it's
[2:00:42] the truth he said something begins to
[2:00:44] pulsate in your bosom that it is the
[2:00:47] truth then make ready you're coming out
[2:00:51] of there just as certain as I stand in
[2:00:53] this Pulpit
[2:00:54] tonight oh if you feel that P pulsation
[2:00:57] in your heart you can make ready for it
[2:01:01] you can make ready for it as we stand
[2:01:02] our
[2:01:05] feet maybe that faith is already in your
[2:01:09] heart but if you'd like to express to
[2:01:13] him that you believe him why don't you
[2:01:17] just start thanking him for it as we
[2:01:19] close our eyes every head bowed
[2:01:23] and and I I know
[2:01:26] that as a man that our words can
[2:01:31] be maybe chopped up and if I said
[2:01:34] anything that wasn't right just forgive
[2:01:36] me and lay it
[2:01:39] aside but we're in the presence of the
[2:01:41] Unseen
[2:01:43] one and when the Unseen comes on the
[2:01:46] sing things
[2:01:48] chains you know see I've got a wife
[2:01:51] tonight
[2:01:52] because the onene came on the
[2:01:55] scene there's a a lot of
[2:01:58] lies that would have had her
[2:02:00] gone but because the on scene came on
[2:02:03] the scene I've got a wife I've got a
[2:02:07] little baby because the on scene came on
[2:02:10] the scene at a youth camp one time I get
[2:02:13] to hold him in my hands and love him
[2:02:16] because the on scene came on the
[2:02:18] scene our sister Ella here with us
[2:02:22] receive the holy ghost in a meeting one
[2:02:25] time oh and think about your
[2:02:28] situations all the Lord's done for you
[2:02:30] when the on scene came on the
[2:02:33] scene and whatever your need is tonight
[2:02:36] he's the same God and we can declare by
[2:02:39] the word that he's here and if the
[2:02:42] Unseen would just come on the scene and
[2:02:45] we believe he's here all then he can do
[2:02:48] for you what he's done for me
[2:02:52] oh how your pastor is still here tonight
[2:02:55] because the on scene came on the scene
[2:02:58] and and lifted him up out of the
[2:03:00] condition he was in and so why don't you
[2:03:02] just go to expressing to the Lord why
[2:03:05] don't you just go to thinking him
[2:03:06] whatever need you have on your heart
[2:03:09] tonight why don't you just go and if you
[2:03:11] have to take the adopted child then just
[2:03:14] start there say Lord I Thank you for it
[2:03:17] I I maybe don't have the Revelation but
[2:03:19] Lord I want it and Lord I thank you for
[2:03:22] the promise Lord I believe it's going to
[2:03:25] come and oh god he's a god of mercy and
[2:03:28] right in that crucial moment he can step
[2:03:31] in oh and he could drop that in your
[2:03:34] heart and his grace and mercy oh and
[2:03:37] it'll be all different
[2:03:39] then oh just express it to him Heavenly
[2:03:43] Father Lord I know my words tonight have
[2:03:46] been chopped up and Lord I know father
[2:03:50] that Lord we have no ability of our own
[2:03:54] but father there's just something in our
[2:03:55] hearts as Believers Lord you've given us
[2:03:58] a Grace to be able to be a candidate for
[2:04:01] association with a world where all
[2:04:03] things are possible and father we have a
[2:04:07] different understanding tonight Lord
[2:04:09] than what we see with our eyes we have
[2:04:11] an understanding that nothing is too
[2:04:13] hard for you Lord we have an
[2:04:17] understanding that Lord depression has
[2:04:19] no hold over a child of God Lord that
[2:04:23] anxiety has no hold over a daughter of
[2:04:26] God Lord that fear is a liar Lord You've
[2:04:30] not given us the spirit of fear but of
[2:04:32] power and of love and of a sound mind
[2:04:35] and father I believe that your healing
[2:04:37] is here I believe your perfect love is
[2:04:40] casting out fear I believe you're here
[2:04:42] tonight and Lord you can meet the the
[2:04:44] hardest of needs you can you can go to
[2:04:47] the darkest of situations Lord and
[2:04:49] someone tonight may feel like they're in
[2:04:51] their Darkest Hour they've ever seen But
[2:04:54] Lord we recognize your presence and it
[2:04:56] brings hope to us tonight Lord that just
[2:04:58] a moment Lord just Lord if Moses could
[2:05:02] spend five minutes in your presence and
[2:05:04] never be the same Lord because he was
[2:05:07] attracted to something father I believe
[2:05:09] there's a presence here tonight that
[2:05:12] just in a few seconds Lord could break
[2:05:14] every stronghold Lord could turn every
[2:05:17] situation around father you're the
[2:05:20] Healer you're the deliver and father
[2:05:22] right now we choose to consider your
[2:05:25] word over the situation we choose to
