[10:29] congratulations today amen let's talk to
[10:33] the
[10:34] Lord Lord Jesus we love you with all of
[10:38] our
[10:39] hearts and now we ask you that you would
[10:42] just
[10:44] come two people can come and clasp
[10:47] hands exchange
[10:50] vows but it takes you to make us
[10:54] one now father we ask you that you would
[10:58] watch over this wedding
[11:00] bless each person that has come
[11:02] today bless Dylan and Devon bless their
[11:06] home father I pray that you would bless
[11:09] their families here
[11:11] today and all of us want to know you
[11:14] more and so we invite you to come close
[11:16] to us today we ask you in Jesus Christ's
[11:20] name amen and
[11:23] amen God is the author of love the Bible
[11:27] teaches us that God is love
[11:31] and that
[11:32] love comes from God from from the
[11:36] beginning to the end the Bible is a love
[11:40] story there we read of God's love for
[11:42] his
[11:43] people he sent Christ to
[11:46] cross for his redeeming love for us as a
[11:49] sinner and the Abiding Love for his
[11:53] redeemed we also read of the love of a
[11:56] man and a
[11:57] woman Jacob love for
[12:01] Rachel Mary was pledged to Joseph and
[12:05] the shulamite to her
[12:08] beloved in the beginning when God
[12:11] created and formed the heavens and the
[12:14] Earth he formed Man Out of the Dust of
[12:17] the ground placed him in the Garden of
[12:20] Eden but just like
[12:22] God Adam was
[12:25] lonely so God came and caused a deep
[12:28] sleep to come upon Adam and he took a
[12:32] rib out of
[12:34] him Adam had saw all kinds of
[12:38] animals had enjoyed all their their
[12:41] company but today was going to be
[12:44] different God was going to form a
[12:48] helpmate for
[12:50] him just like your eyes as you turned
[12:52] and looked here just a few moments ago I
[12:55] can imagine what Adam looked at when he
[13:00] saw
[13:01] Eve what a wonderful day that it was so
[13:05] God performed the first marriage in the
[13:08] Garden of
[13:09] Eden now God brings us to our life's
[13:12] companion and Abraham prayed that God
[13:16] would find a wife for his son and Isaac
[13:19] and God remembered that prayer and when
[13:23] Abraham's servant found Rebecca the
[13:25] servant bowed and worshiped praising God
[13:29] and he brought her to the master's son
[13:32] and the scripture said that Isaac loved
[13:35] her and was
[13:38] comforted
[13:39] Devon Dylan it's just like our walk with
[13:42] Jesus Christ we start our walk and God
[13:46] asked us to take on his name the name of
[13:49] the Lord Jesus
[13:51] Christ and the longer that we serve him
[13:55] the more he feels our life and the more
[13:58] he feels our life the more like him we
[14:01] will become now you may not believe this
[14:05] but if you could look around the room
[14:08] there's couple sitting here that's been
[14:09] married 40 50 years maybe even 60
[14:13] years and after a while they'll even
[14:15] start thinking one another's thoughts
[14:17] and finishing one another's sentences
[14:21] and and know the mistakes of each
[14:24] other you guys are going to do that what
[14:27] you laugh about it with your mom and dad
[14:30] you're going to do
[14:32] it so
[14:34] today is the new beginning for
[14:37] you I rehearsed this
[14:39] with Dylan last
[14:42] night and so it's no news to him but
[14:46] today is the last day of his life that
[14:50] he's going to be
[14:57] right it's a true statement to too I
[14:59] want you to understand
[15:03] that God has guided you Dylan and guided
[15:07] you Devon to this
[15:10] moment has blessed your love and brought

[21:00] Devin Dylan the marriage ceremony in
[21:03] which you are you to be Ted United is
[21:07] the first is the oldest ceremony in the
[21:10] world it is celebrated in the beginning
[21:13] of the presence of
[21:15] God marriage is the gift of God given to
[21:20] comfort the Sorrows of
[21:22] life and to magnify its
[21:25] Joys marriage is the clasping of hands
[21:28] and blending of Hearts the union of two
[21:32] lives as becoming
[21:34] one your marriage must stand not by the
[21:38] authority of the state nor by the seal
[21:42] that is going to be on your wedding
[21:44] certificate but rather it must stand by
[21:47] the strength of Your Love It Must Stand
[21:50] by Your
[21:51] Devotion to one
[21:54] another in good
[21:56] times and in bad times
[21:59] finally it must stand because God's
[22:03] participation in your
[22:05] relationship the word of God tells us
[22:08] that
[22:09] love this is what love does if I speak
[22:13] with the tongues of men and angels but I
[22:16] have not love I am only a a sounding
[22:19] brass and a s tinkling symbol if I have
[22:24] the gift of Prophecy and cannot fathom
[22:26] mysteries in the knowledge if I have the
[22:29] faith that can move
[22:31] mountains but I have not
[22:33] love I am nothing if I give all that I
[22:37] possess to the poor and surrender my
[22:39] body to the
[22:41] Flames but if I have not
[22:44] love I have
[22:47] nothing this is the good part love is
[22:52] patient love is
[22:54] kind it does not envy it does not boast
[22:59] it is not proud it is not
[23:03] rude it is not
[23:05] self-seeking it is not easily
[23:08] angered it keeps no record of
[23:12] wrongs it keeps no record of
[23:19] wrongs it keeps no record of wrongs
[23:23] love love does not Delight in evil but
[23:28] rejoices the truth it always
[23:32] protects it always
[23:34] trust it always
[23:37] hopes and it always
