with us uh this week Lord as we travel about our ways Lord keep that angel about us protect us guide us keep us in your will in your name we pray amen so you can have a seat if you like so we supposed to I was supposed to do this last week make some just some reminders and things didn't work out so here we are this week so first of all I'd like to defend myself for my artistic work that I did during the date night because you know you really shouldn't judge a person by just one drawing really you it might be what you had to work with you know I me ain't that right Doug hey she's got brother brother William preach on Graces now she can't she she can't say nothing to me so so I mean just what I had to work with you know so so I got myself tickled here a little bit so so just some some some reminders here you know we we do this occasionally we don't do it often just you know nothing major just you know as we come in we want to come in find a seat and um you know not move around new talking you know if you need to talk somebody you know just tap them on the shoulder and step out on the porch you know because the VES is open now because you know the crowd and stuff so we we we made a so we could seat everybody so if you need to talk to somebody don't move from seat to seat before church after church it don't matter when it is just Peck them on the shoulder take them out on the porch and say hey carry the conversation on you know this is not a place that we want to do that at you know you know respect the house of the Lord this this is not a social Gathering now naturally it's a social Gathering spiritually so we don't want to we don't want to do things that's you know that disrupt the service or somebody else you know so after we just missed just a reminder you know kids keep keep up with your kids it's tight out here on this porch cars coming by cars backing up don't don't let your kids be playing out there you know we're going to watch over best as we can but it's not really our responsibility I got enough responsibility of two I got you know so so you know you know I got to keep an eye on them so so we we want to make sure we we we you know and and and even after the service is going on we we we we want to be reverent coming and going you know when when you leave try not to run back and forth because there's sometimes there's people still praising worshiping the Lord in the s in the in the building here so we don't want to we don't want to do nothing to disturb it so if your kids please we we've been trying to even lock the doors a little bit after everybody has a chance we're not rushing nobody out and and even when we get out on the porch you know try to give people room especially we you know everybody's not young like me so you know I can maneuver a little bit but we have we have elderly people here that that needs to to get in and out a little better than when I do so try try not to block the steps or the highway I mean we can walk around the corner of the building here and and give people room and especially when if it's not raining or nothing you know it's nice weather outside so just be reverent when we dismiss you know no talking no just if you need to talk again just just go outside and just do it you know try we try to you know we want to limit the amount of movement during the service amount of trips we go back and forth to the bathroom and just parents just keep your eyes on that and uh be responsible for them and then then also drivers when you come around you just need to be careful when you drive around you know because there you know some kids I know how kids are and I was a kid and into things you know sometimes you just take off not look that parents just as you drive around through there be be extremely extremely careful and and just we just want to do the right things and you know going back to you know this is not a place you go back to a social together where you come in and eat and drink and do things it's not a place you do that so you know just try to reverent the house of the Lord as much as possible this you know this is we don't want to be doing those things here in this in the service uh one other thing too is down here at the shed down here we call it the water building that's where all our water and stuff takes place as that we got timers and stuff on the the fall and waterfall down there and and for the water and heal so it won't dry and corrode away we try to keep the grass on that thing so when it rains it it don't corrode the hill out so we want to try to keep that grass growing so we're not telling you you can't use water but if you do use the water please let brother Adam know that so he can check that timer because we don't we have burnt a pump up somehow or another because maybe something happened I don't know but we burnt one pump up we don't want to so if you need water use it but please let brother Adam know so he can make sure everything is set back right and that everything is is functional there because we don't want to do anything so God bless you we love you do what's right for it's the right thing to do as we take up

just to be able to stand before the bride of Christ amen and be able to present this message once again amen God bless you musicians amen this morning uh we want to continue to remember our pastor brother Ron Brother Andrew there that God would just continue to just minister to them and help them recoup after this weekend they've they we' had some marvelous services and uh brother Andrew will be speaking again this morning for the last service there at bible way so want to be praying for him and uh everything that'll go on there that God would just recoup their bodies they've given their all like usual and so we want to pray for their their bodies that God would just strengthen them on their way back and then next weekend or this coming week brother Joe Green Services there at uh Ruth

just be remembering that and uh brother Josh Bennett will speak the first two Services I believe and then Dad will speak the the last two of that service on the uh evenings so we remember them and uh is anyone planning to go to those meetings just by an uplifted hand amen we just want to be praying for y'all that God would just give y'all traveling mercies there amen do you love the Lord this morning amen let's just turn to the the scriptures let's turn to Isaiah 41 and verse 10 now I I did this thought last last time I spoke on leadership and uh based it from uh Nehemiah so this morning we're going to uh kind of go over part two uh so you just bear with me this morning and if you didn't hear uh we pray that you go back and listen to it I not it was good just kidding just kidding but we just pray that uh that you would get something from that and draw from it but we'll kind of just recap some of those thoughts that we had there but Isaiah 41 and10 fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help help thee yay I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness aren't you glad that he's with you this morning and he's guiding you and he keeps you in Psalms 37 and verse 5 and it says commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass that's what we want this morning don't we we want to commit everything to him amen God bless you you can be seated this morning God bless the reading of the word as I said I want to continue with leadership and maybe if I would title it leadership I want to I believe it would be subtitle it it's different now and when he comes he makes the difference so leadership and it's different now so this morning I would like to kind of just go over some of the thoughts that we had previously and uh if you would like to turn with me to Daniel 9 and verse 1 and in the first year of Darius the son of hus the seed of mes which was made King over the realm of the Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign ad Daniel understood the books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet Prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in desolations of Jerusalem and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sooth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord God and he made my confession and said oh Lord great and Dreadful God keep thy Covenant and the mercy to them that love him and that keep his commandments so I know I I begin with Nehemiah and the reason why we read Daniel is because we want to understand that there was a prophecy that's being fulfilled here and that Nehemiah had to fulfill that prophecy so as I bring forth uh into uh remembrance some of these things Daniel understood that in 70 years desolation would be accomplished of the Jews and so that would begin the uh the wall preparation there and in verse 9 of Daniel or chapter 9 verse 20 and it says and while I spake and praying and confessing my sin and my sin of My People Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I have seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding so God is sending Angel Gabriel there to Daniel so that he can have understanding of the scriptures of what Jeremiah prophesied cuz the Jeremiah Pro prophesied in Jeremiah 25:11 and said this whole land shall be desolate and astonishment and the Nations Shall Serve the king of Babylon for 70 years see this is the prophecy and Daniel is understanding it from what Gabriel is explaining here and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that that I will punish the king of Babylon and that Nation saith the Lord for their iniquity in the land of the Chaldeans and I will make thee a Perpetual desolation and I will bring upon on that land and all my words which I have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which Jeremiah hath prophesied Against All Nations for my Nations and great Kings Shall Serve themselves of them also and I will recompense them according to their deeds according to the works of their own hands for thus saith the Lord God of Israel unto me take the wine cup of this pure at my hand and cause all nations to whom I send thee to drink it and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword and I will send among them so we understand that Jeremiah has prophesied this Daniel is understanding the prophecy and has the vision thereof and he goes on down here and forgive me for jumping back and forth but I want you to understand this this morning and it says at the be and 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy for therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to the restoration to and to build Jerusalem see we here we're we're going to that building of that unto the Messiah the prince shall be 70 weeks three score two weeks the street shall be built again the wall even in trouble times and after three score two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off who are we speaking of here Jesus and what it's talking about is from this time and we know that from that time on it is believe it's 486 years or 386 years I might have wrote it down anyways from the time from the wall being built until Messiah is coming off the Mount of Olives so he shall be cut off shall be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be the flood and unto the end of the war desolation determined and shall confirm the Covenant for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and the overspreading of the Abominations and he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation that determined shall be poured upon the Desolation and we go I'm sorry to be so scripturally and quota this morning but just bear with me on all these things amen do you love the Lord amen and in Matthew 24 where the Messiah is and this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached into the all the world for witness unto all nations and then shall the end come and when ye therefore shall see the abomination of the Desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understandeth am aren't you thankful for that this morning that through God Daniel was able to understand the prophecy from Jeremiah and through that when Nehemiah began the wall he understood it's not just a wall being built God could have created a wall out of nothing he's God he can do that but what was it it was Nehemiah he had a burden on his heart so God had created that burden upon his heart he gave him the means to be able to build the wall through the king he went and build the wall now he had a lot of things that didn't go his way A lot of things that come up against him but he continue on because he had a word from the Lord and so Nehemiah wasn't just building a wall he was bringing the Israelites back together and bringing the identity to the Jews back again you understand that and we're thankful for that this morning and so Nehemiah and the reason why we choose Nehemiah is such uh so many leadership things that is in there but leadership is not merely an upholding of position or authority it's in inspiring others to reach their full potential and guiding them through challenges so Nehemiah had to be able to have an understanding of what the people went through he was one of them that was family that was friends that was a burden upon his heart now many times it's easy to to have people to do something that they want to do amen it's easy to PE lead people to places where they want to go that's easy but it's hard to lead people to places that's hard that's tough amen if I ask brother Nathan I said brother Nathan me and you we're going for Crispy Cream he's going to come with me we're going to enjoy it I call him up the next day and I say hey brother Nathan we're going to go over to Smileys man it's good that's some good stuff right there amen and then and then maybe the next day I say you know what I'm craving a steak let's go to Longhorn you like Longhorn I like Longhorn let's eat a steak he's like man I'm loving this yeah absolutely and then I call Nathan up in about a week and I say hey brother Nathan now Smileys Crispy Cream and that steak that's it's putting on some pounds here for me but let's go to the gym let's go run a mile let's go work out now it might not not work out for Nathan to go that day he he might say you know what I got things I got to do and something just come up it's easy to lead people where it's easy to go it's hard to lead people on things like that things like work going to church hey it was a struggle this morning to get up fix your tie getting all nice and pretty some of you drove several hours to be here you had a little skin in the game this morning amen so it was a little bit tough but hey you're here God LED you here he placed you here in this position this morning aren't you glad of that amen true leadership is not found in titles or Corner offices it's found in actions in the willingness to take responsibility and in the courage to make tough decisions for the greater good it's not always easy a good leader listens more than he speaks understands more than they judge and empowers more than they control they lead by example setting high standards of Integrity honesty and humility leadership is about building trust creating a shared vision and real and rallying people around a common position and purpose it's about recognizing the strengths of each individual and leveraging each of them to achieve their success now we're not all built the same and as I went through Nehemiah last time we found that certain people will do certain jobs at certain times sometimes they'll go over and Beyond sometimes they'll do what is just necessary amen so you have to recognize there's some people that will do that there's some people that won't some people that you're going to have to just hey we can do this you got this you're going to have to cheerlead them on a little bit more and then there are some that you go hey I need you to go do this and they do more than what you asked them to and you're like Wow Come on Amen and so that's that's leadership and that's being able to recognize each and every individual's purpose and what they're going to fulfill in life amen not all of us is going to be doctors not all of us going to be lawyers not all of us is going to be junk dealers or truckers or we got a lot of nurses in here I like I said before I'll hold junk now for 11 so you have to find your position and what you can do amen so Nehemiah helped them to be able to accomplish that goal and so I had brother Nath Nathan come up here and I had my sword And my trial out in my hands and we worked and we worked together as a bride Believers and that's what we're here this morning is we're working in a Collective Agreement that Jesus Christ is coming again and we're working towards a goal this morning amen and then there was times that now I couldn't work with one hand and fight with the other and I had to give the sword over to brother Nathan and I said brother Nathan I trust you to have my back at this time at this moment cuz I'm going to I'm about a great work but I need you to be there with me he had my back and many times we're going to have to have each other's back in life there's things that'll come up and and you'll have to call a saint and be like listen I need some prayer over this right now and I know that you're a prayer Warrior and you have my back on this you don't even have to tell them all you just know that they're going to go to prayer fervent prayer over your thing what you're Desiring at that moment and so Nehemiah was a great leader into to be able to do those things and so they got ridiculed mocked and Scorn over it all and so I kind of want to start this morning in in that the opposition and ridicule that was given to them and we went over this a little bit but I want to Major this morning on these facts and Nehemiah in chapter 4 and 1 it said and it came to pass that when Sam ballot heard that we build it the wall he was rough and took great indignation and mocked the Jews they are just building the wall and he's criticizing them mocking them in verse two and he spake before his brother Brethren and the army of Samaria and said what do these feeble Jews and what they' fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned now I want you to notice something Sam ballot is is speaking to people that is on his side that is in his community in his little group and he's making fun of them and he's mocking them what are they going to do restore these stones out of the rubbish oh they're burned what what can these feeble Jews do and so he was talking amongst his Brethren there now toath the ammonite was by him and he joined in with him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall them people Jews a little fox as as gentle and good as he is he would just tear it down just running up over that thing D y'all crazy trying to make a wall like that y'all can't build nothing I mean you got brother alen painting back here look look and just make so much fun but I want you to understand that they was making fun in their little group they was criticizing in their little group and it is easy when you criticize with people that are critical and you're not going to go CR criticize with somebody that's behind the whole work and let's get to it we're going to do a work you're not going to go to somebody and criticize the work while they're doing the work I I have found that over and over again a Critic will be a Critic no no matter where you're at and he will find people in his little group that they can criticize about and most of the time and I want you to understand if they criticize at home across the kitchen table the children hear it and the children become critical amen and then the children grow up and they say well Mom and Dad was critical of this I don't need that and what have you done you have caused them to be critical IAL and criticize things that they don't even understand about now you may make it through but they might not they might not know what they're criticizing about they don't know they don't understand so be careful what you're saying and being critical of well it's hot in the church it's cold in the church he's way too loud I can't hear him at all they took my parking spot they took my seat what are we here for now we're we're not I'm not going to ask you amen we're here for a purpose we're not building a wall this morning I've not asked you to do manual labor I've just ask you to get behind the word help me this morning amen we're about our father's business this morning amen and in Moses brother Brandon would say and without a leader we are helpless and Christ is our leader and God was Moses's leader though he sent an angel to lead him I send my angel before thee to keep thee in the way and bring thee in the place which I have promised and the angel was to be a leader to be his leader the angel performed Miracles Moses never performed any Miracle the angel of God in Moses performed the miracle and you see what I mean the angel of the Lord was with him he's with you this morning the angel LED them and performed the Miracles hey he's with you this morning the angels are guiding you this morning he's encamped about you this morning aren't you thankful for that that we have an angel in this age that has given us the message that has leading us through this Dark Age this age of leadsa he's leading you this morning he's not going to leave you comfortless God is with you this morning so there's always going to be criticism from people around you and I love this quote brother Doug you're going to like this man in the arena Theodore Roosevelt I love this this is one of my favorites the poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer there are many men who feel a kind of Twisted pride and cynicism there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the ways others do what they themselves dare not even attempt there is no more unhealthy being no man less worthy of respect than he who either really holds or FS to hold an attitude of sneering and disbelief toward all that is great and lofty whether in achievement or in that Noble effort which even if it fails comes second in achievement it's not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of Deeds could have done them better the credit Belongs To The Man in the arena right amen whose face is marred by dust and sweating blood who strives ently who HS who comes short again and again because there is no effort without Heir and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the Deeds who knows great astonishment enthusiasm excuse me the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at best knows at the end of the Triumph and high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails daring greatly so that his place shall never his place shall never be with those cold and timid Souls who neither know Victory nor defeat amen Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise this morning we're not in the seat of the scornful this morning we're not in the seat of this critic this morning because the critic don't count you count for something this morning you're about something this morning congratulations you're making a difference this morning amen glory sir them poor and timid Souls that know no Victory nor defeat they don't know what it's like to step out and say I'm going to take on this storm head on but you do each and every one of you has been through a lot each and every one of you could say how in the world did I ever get to this position this seat where I'm sitting at this morning how did I get here cuz you've been through many things many tolls many dangers but you've overcome amen and granted to thee that overcome amen there's going to be a kingdom for each and every one of us amen so as we speak on these things this morning it's a character building those critics will create character in each and every one of you and a lot of times you don't even listen but sometimes you go okay you know what if that's the case like Nehemiah did there was a point and a time when they was fighting with sword and trial to create something and they said you know what we're going to have have to you know what I'll do when the trumpet sounds you gather over here because there is a wink link right there so sometimes you take and go you know what maybe that that was a good point but brother Brandon would say it like this in influence and I believe if a nation or a people or a church or an individual no matter how much the critics criticize you just do the right thing just do the right thing no matter how much they criticize no matter what they say what they do do the right thing and he says they have to have respect for you anyway right down in their heart he Saidi found that to be true see be honest and be upright people and they will respect you just do the right thing as brother Alden says you do the right thing and the right thing gets done amen so with that Integrity that devotion in your life that says you know what no matter what happens I'm going to do the right thing no matter who criticizes let me just do the right thing and you will be an influence an influence is the capacity to have effort on character development or the behavior of someone or something or the effect in itself so you have great influence this morning each and every one of us has influence about us I enjoy uh college baseball and one of the college baseball coaches that I enjoy listen to in their speeches is uh head coach Tim Corbin from Vanderbilt and I get a lot of good inspiration from him I'm raising a young man and so I I look at what other people are doing to create leaders in their Community how are they doing that what are they doing and so Tim Corbin tells a story of character about a man that or a boy while he was a coach at Clemson he went and the head coach told him said I want you to go recruit this guy he's great great athlete he's going to do a lot of good things and we want him said all right so he went and he watched him and he said I like to get to the games early just so I can see how they interact how they do things what they do he said so when I got to the game I watched this this kid that we was there for and he was by himself didn't really interact with his team a lot had to go try to find somebody just to warm up he said so I thought well that's kind of odd that's kind of odd that he would do something like that you know great athlete like this a lot of time the athlet is one of the more popular ones or the leaders on their teams and so then it come to his Bat and his at bat and he was on deck and he said that he looked up at his mom in the stands and he went like this and said and so his mom thought okay well I'll bring him his Gatorade and so his mom walked down the steps went and handed his Gatorade over to him said she kind of struggled to do it but she did it and said he got it and he took a drink of it barely put the cap back on and just tossed it over to her like whatever never said Thank you never said I love you never had no interaction just didn't respect her and he said you know what I think I'm done I think I'm done he said we continue to watch this kid and he had a great game wonderful game and he goes back to the head coach at Clemson and the head coach at Clemson says what do you think he said oh he's a great athlete he's going to get a full ride somewhere definitely D1 great great that's what I thought you was going to say he said but I'm going to tell you no don't go after him don't even don't even waste your time on this guy he said because he lacks character he lacks character he said and if he will disrespect his teammates his coaches his own mother he will not have any respect for you none he said you know what the head coach of Clemson he said I have enough trust in you that I'm going to okay so they let him go they didn't even recruit him no more he went to a D1 college he got drafted out of out of college within the first round and he said he went on to go and play on several several several several teams and see what happened was is that kid never learned character and respect for others so he never was able to get along with anyone and so I want you to understand this morning people are watching you watching you from a distance watching how you respect others what will you say to others how will you do things that's influence that's influence young people when you may kind of speak at your mom or say something to your dad real harsh there's going to be somebody that sees that and go I don't want to have no part with that and especially other parents when they see a child do or say something about that kid says something about their own they don't want their children to hang out with those type of children because they don't want them to take on those characteristics and that influence amen because there is great influence in each and every Act and everything that you do amen and brother Brandon would say it like this unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering you're going to have to go through some tiles and trials and test in your life character is a victory character is a victory it's not a gift a man without character can't reain because power apart from character is satanic you may have power you may have a lot of things in your hand but if you don't have character to go with what you have it's satanic you cannot be used it will never be able to be developed you will never have respect for leaders or a boss on the site you may have the knowledge more smart and better than what any boss or anyone on your job site might have but you have to have character to understand where they are coming from but Power I like this power with character is fit to rule amen aren't you glad of that that power with character is fit to rule this morning so Nehemiah was building character amongst each and every one of them so I'd like to kind of transition this morning from Nehemiah to to another type of leader and brother Brandon would go over leadership in a message and he would use two young rulers and this morning I would like to go to Matthew 19 and verse 16 this morning do you love the Lord amen thank you for bearing with me this morning amen Matthew 19 and 16 and behold one came out and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life it's a great question great question and he said unto him why callest thou me good Jesus speaking to him here why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou Wilt enter into life see they were living but there's life keep the Commandments and he saith unto him which Jesus Jesus said Thou shalt not murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not be bear false witness honor thy father and mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and look what he says here the Young Rich Young Ruler he says the young man saith unto him excuse me all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet I've done all these things but I want eternal life and Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect go and sell what thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me go sell what you have give to the poor and you'll have the greatest gift the greatest treasure no man can ever fathom but you see he was only seeing materialistic things he was only seeing what all he owned but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions so this Rich Young Ruler as he was growing up his mama would lead him and we all must be led we all must be guided around as a little child and so before long the Rich Young Ruler he he had to had to have some lessons and some things that you know he he had to learn so he had a teacher and so that's the way of our life our mother will lead you then you have a teacher in your life that'll kind of teach you some things you're going to have to learn some developmental skills communication mathematics and I know young children you're about to go back to school and it's going to be tough don't be critical I mean my nowadays they hardly give any homework I asked Titus almost every time he gets home from school like you any homework no what' you do in school today nothing not a thing my goodness that's it's amazing to me not a thing not a thing so you need a teacher to help you learn some of the things and how to do nothing I guess that's what they're teaching nowadays I don't know Sister Sarah is that sister Faith is that what they're teaching nothing no yeah don't be critical they're teaching a lot these days there's more of it amen hallelujah so he had a teacher that would lead him and guide him into some of these things and so after he learned so much then he has a father that says you've learned these things I've sent you to school you've went to University now I'm going to teach you about the father's business and I'm going to show you how to great have great possessions in life and so he taught the rich younger all these things and he had many great things he probably drove the Range Rover the nicest car he had all these great things lived in a nice Castle somewhere but you know what there was something on the inside of him that said you know what I'm I'm lacking something and I don't know what it is because many times that what we come to in our life because you you can have everything in this whole world you can have riches you may be poor but you do other things alcohol drugs smoke whatever it is but you're still liking something there's still a desire on your heart that says something's there so when you find that something all that will beat it'll dissipate when you find that thirst it it'll cure it all and so he had all these things but what did he lack us he wanted eternal life now this morning I'm not asking each and every one of you to sell everything you have you don't have to sell it all you don't have to give it all away to the poor but I am asking you to be willing to give it all be willing to give it all it's not ours and I'm going to get to that a little bit more later but none of this in this life none of these materialistic things is ours God has a hold on each and everything everything in life but be willing to give it all and that's what he was wanting I want you to be willing to give it all and come follow me just just that simple thing just be willing to give it all and come follow me so as we talk about those things I want I want to he was not willing to do that and he went away sorrowful but God God's given you more than than money lands and riches he's given you life health and strength but above all he's givv you this word and I want to read the parable this morning of the talents in Matthew 25 and verse1 14 and Jesus says the parable of talent says for the Kingdom of Heaven is a man traveling into a far country who calleth his own servants and delivered unto them goods and unto the one he gave five Talons unto another he gave two and to another servant one every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey so the good servant has given some of his possessions to these servants according to their abilities 5 2 and one each one of them he's given something and so each one of them I'm going to skip some of these scriptures here but and so the good Master then he comes back now the one he went and he digged in the earth and hid the Lord's money I'm going to give a little bit of a demonstration this morning uh Annie you come here you you help me out I demonstrate Jada I want you to help me and then brother Nathan if you would stand so so I I'm going to go to a country and uh while I'm gone I want you to take care of some stuff for me I want you to do something for me you're going to need to do little thing and it's going to increase okay so but I'm going to give you five Talons this morning okay so you hold on to that for me okay all right and I'm going to give you two and I want you to hold on to that for me are are you getting the idea this morning so so he was giving them something and brother Nathan you get one I'm sorry and he already knows the end of the story but anyways so what I want you to do I want you to go back to brother Alden and I want you to just say God bless you richly okay can you go do that for me brother Alden just yeah God bless you richly so she's she's going about something this morning she she's she's doing something with that and she's going to come back and I I want you to notice something that it's increased now what you got this morning there go go back here he you going to get [Applause] yeah I need that I need that now [Applause] yeah this ain't Hollywood it's just me and brother Al we just kind of come over something right before church he said okay I got it he said there going to be a lot of them coming I said no I'll Point him out who's coming you'll be okay just give them the five so you took the five and you went and got another five well that's awesome good job very good very good what' you do to do it you say God bless you yeah hey well I'm proud of you I thank you for doing that for me so I'm going to give you both of those now and that's yours okay because I've seen that you have increased it okay God bless bless you amen you can go sit down sister Jada now I've given you two and I want you to go there to brother Alden and I want you to see if you can increase but but but before you go you say God bless you the Lord's going to protect your path all right and so so she's doing a little something with it this morning and in the meantime Nathan has went and sat down with it and he's not going to going to do nothing with this and he's just sitting there and he said you know what they gave me one and I'm scared of this master because he owns a lot of good things and I don't want to mess up what he's given me and I think this is probably probably the best I ain't I a want to do nothing with it dude but the servant that had even two now what did you get well she got four Hallelujah it worked yeah and I'm going to say to you well done you did great Annie you did great well done very good yeah you can go on now thank you now Nathan how many did you get nothing I thought you had one one okay one so so he's got one now how did you increase it you you didn't okay well you probably thought I was bad guy and I probably wouldn't give it back if I if you knew so but you know what since you didn't want to do nothing with it I'm going to go and I'm going to do something with the one that wanted to do the most with what the lord gave her and I'm going to give it to Annie and she did the most she had to make two trips oh yeah it's improv here now Nathan why would you do that why yeah know I just didn't understand why he would do something like that but he probably thought I was a bad master and that I would take more from him than what he had and I would take maybe what he had and what he had collected and and I want but you know what he's not like that but God wants you to increase what he's given you amen so now I've given you example of the money this morning but God is not wanting the money he's wanting you and he wants increase on what he's given you he's given you this Bible this word of God now many people will lay it on a shelf and they'll say he's a good Master now I don't want to mess up anything that he's told me so I'm not going to do much with that okay but what did he say to the one said depart from me I never knew you for there's going to be weeping Welling and nashing of teeth I don't have to worry about that this morning that part is not for me that part is not for you because I want you to take and I want you to do something with this I want you to take this word what God has given you in this last day amen black white and red he's given it to you I want you to eat it I want you to take every bit of it and I want you to increase everything amen he's a good god he's a great God he's given you all this in this last day he's given us a messenger to this last day a message we have Message Hubs we have books we have tapes we have all these things but God is Not Looking for books tapes MP3 players CD players he is not going to Rapture any of those this morning we're not going to set these on the shelf and one day we're going to look at it and go it's gone I knew he was coming back for that that's what I knew he was coming back for but he wants you he wants what's deposited on the inside of you to grow amen don't just hide it don't just put it on a shelf don't just let it sit there increase it this morning if I've tried to do anything with my children I want them to increase in this they may do great things in in this whole world they may do great things but if I can implant something in them this morning I want to imp implant that God is a good god in this day of Le Osa he has sent us the last Messenger to the final age the final voice to this age God has given you everything this morning amen he's implanted something in and that's what I want to implant to them that's what I want to encourage you can have many things in this world the rich ruler had many riches many weals but I want something that's more that's just going to just last until I pass I want something that when I get there he will look at me and he say Well done well done my good and faithful servant you did what I asked you to do you took this word you Aid on this word you loved this word amen it's not just about how many times you come to church write your name on a church Bible amen I've said it before I'll say it again like granddaddy you can write your name on a church book write the part sign the barn door with red paint Shake a mule's tail and you get more kick out of it but when you get into this word amen when you get all of this message when you start to become this messag when you start to hear it you go oh that voice behind that voice is speaking to me this morning hallelujah amen there's something about it and in every battle that you're going to go through in life you have to face it to be able to give up everything in every battle the man that is willing to die in that battle is going to be the man that is going to win that fight that man that is willing to give it all in that battle that man that is willing to lay his life on the line and says I don't care if I don't get through this but God has a place for me amen God has this and I want you to say this morning I want you to say Satan I'm your worst nightmare cuz you are his worst nightmare Satan I'm your worst nightmare come on now I am Satan's worst nightmare in this final age because God has laid something on the inside of me that will not fail and when he comes back he will find what he left he will find what he deposited he will find what he left us this morning written Epistles read of all men amen you will spread the gospel each and every one of you you'll spread it far and wide you'll reach more people than I'll reach and he's inlined something in each and every one of you this morning God's so good God's so good you must do something with it God has your back the other Rich Young Ruler that brother Brandon would talk about is Moses and Moses as a child his mother could see that there was something different about Moses and so she took and she put him in the bull rush and said Lord be with you and said the little the little daughter followed the Moses down the river while the crocodiles came the angel protected him and she watched it all the way into Pharaoh's camp and when the daughter of pharaoh found this baby she begin to teach it begin to raise it but he wasn't just there just to learn things he wasn't there just to be a ruler God laid something on him more than just to be another pharaoh nor than just to be another king of Egypt but there was something a burden on his heart that says my people my people and you would see what he did Moses got in the way of his own self at first Moses did what he thought that he could do and a lot of times a man or woman will try to do stuff their way thinking this is what God wants God just wants you to surrender it to him and Moses killed a man and went to the back side of the desert but at the backside of the desert when Moses had nothing else says Moses I'm going to use you are you willing to give it all Moses for your people and he would say well who Am I who am I that I would lead a people out of Egypt I I know Pharaoh I know the hardness that they're under but I am a one man and brother Brandon would call him a onean Invasion one man Invasion that went to Egypt and brought a people out because he had the word of the Lord God said you tell them I am that I am sent you I am that I am is with you I am that I am thus sayeth the Lord for I am the Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob you tell them that so I'm telling you this morning he's with you the Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is with you this morning all the way down Through the Ages he's protected you this morning he's watched over your seed this morning and you are more than a conqueror through him through Christ this morning because you have I am that I am with you let's stand this morning give God glory in the house of the Lord and Jesus excuse me brother Brandon would say would we see Jesus I go away but I come again that is right and I will be with you even in you until the end of the world and Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever there's no planer gospel I do not know any planer gospel then here's the challenge now if he would come how would he Jesus has no hands on the Earth today but your hands he uses my mouth your mouth my eyes your eyes the whole thing is submitting yourself to the holy spirit of God and God works through his individuals he has no hands but your hands he has no eyes but your eyes he's in you and he wants you to take action with it this morning he wants you to do something with it this morning what God has given you don't just set it on a shelf don't just lay it by the way don't just say it's for this one or that one and be critical of what others may do or what you do what God has laid on the inside of you to do cuz God Is Your Leader do you love him this morning amen maybe we'll sing that Overcomer I'm an overcomer I love that
