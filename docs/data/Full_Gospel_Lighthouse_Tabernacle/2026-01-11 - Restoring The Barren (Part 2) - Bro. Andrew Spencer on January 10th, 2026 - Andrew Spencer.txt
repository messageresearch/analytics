And father, if we can only believe over the prayer requests, if we can only believe for our [music] our lost family. And Lord, it's your promise. It's a promise, Father, that that I didn't [music] make it. No pastor made it, but Father, God almighty made it. And Lord, we believe you this evening, Lord. And father, as the request was made known, Lord Jesus, we're just praying that you can just come meet every need. Meet the needs of the cancer.

But Father, while there's [music] today, while there's still hope for today, Lord, for the lost, for the just the need that just in our midst, Lord, our pastor, [music] as he's fighting with cancer, fighting with diabetes, fighting with the kidneys, Lord, as a man myself, I I I think I'd give up. But, Father, you [music] put a fight and he showed us how to fight. He's shown a bride how to fight, how to believe God's word. [music] And so, Father, we pray that you just give him the strength in his body. And Lord, just Sister Kim Weekes, just talk [music] to her today. And Father, the the pain she's going through, Lord, I just pray that you can just visit her. Give her a touch, Lord. And Father, we do commit this service in your hands.

You be &gt;&gt; se I have seen some pretty [snorts] guess. I've been around, found no place to settle down. There is a land [music] I am just a pilgrim here to [music] this world of [singing] fear. My [music] time to leave is drawing [music] near. I'm [singing] going to that land. And there is a [music] land I'm homesick for. Though I've [singing] never seen [music] it before. I've got [singing] loved ones waiting on [music and singing] that shore. There is a land [music] and it's not a meal. [music] miles away or on some far [music] off distance I'll speed up and they'll slow [music] down. Where [singing] is the land? [music] And why [singing and music] am I so homesick for? I'm just not myself [music] here [singing] anymore. I'm waiting [music and singing] for that open door that leads [music] to that land. [music] So, I'll dry these weeping [music] [singing] eyes and I'll I'll lift my [music] hands up toward the sky. [music and singing] Oh, farewell to this old world. Goodbye. because I'm I'm going [singing] to land. Oh, sing it with me. And there [music and singing] is a land I'm homesick for. Though I've never seen it, I've [music] never seen it before. [singing] I've got loved ones [music] there waiting on that [music] shore. And [singing] there is [music] a land [music] and it's not a million [music and singing] miles away. You're on some [singing] far off distant strand. [music] I'll speed up and there [music] slow [singing] down and there is a land. [music and singing] I like this part. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Why [singing] am I so homesick for? You see, [music] I'm just not myself here [singing] anymore.

I'll speed [music and singing] up and there'll [music] slow down and there [singing] is a land. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Once my clothes [music and singing] were ragged, the world looked down on me. [music] I had no hope for tomorrow, [singing] nor for eternity. [music] Then grace came [singing] with mercy and [music] heard this orphan's plea. Now I've been [singing] adopted from bondage. [music] I've been set free. Now I'm [singing] no longer [music] open. Jesus [singing] has rescued me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; My garments no longer [singing] are tattered. My family is royalty. [music] I came so empty. No place [music] to call my home. No one to really [singing] love me. But now [music] look what I [singing] earn. For I'm feasting on [music] the mana that comes from God [singing] on high. And there is no shortage. [music] There is [singing] a passive. Now I'm no [singing] longer [music] an orphan. Jesus has rescued [music and singing] me. My garments no longer [singing] are tatter. My family [music] is royalty. [singing] For [music] my family is royalty. [music] [applause] Amen.

That God is faithful. Amen. Isn't it a wonderful hour to be a Christian? [music] Amen. To be alive. We we welcome you here tonight and trust you've come expecting this weekend [music] that God will do great things amongst us. And Amen. If you have your Bibles, we just like to look in the book of Joel chapter 2 tonight. Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and Isaiah chapter 54. Amen. Joel chapter 2 verse 25. While you're just making your way there, let's just talk to the author of his word tonight. Lord Jesus, we come before you tonight, Lord, and we humble ourselves before the great I am. Lord, we recognize, Lord Jesus, that we are completely insufficient without the Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus. You said in your word that without me, you can do nothing. And we realize, Lord Jesus, that we had a prophet that would stand right here in this hour and would speak and he would say, "Now you know that I'm waiting on something." Father, we realize that we are completely helpless and hopeless without the grace and the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ. But we pray tonight that your Holy Spirit would come upon your children. You would just allow the the wings of the Almighty God to rest upon us, Lord Jesus, like a a mother eagle covering its eagllets. We pray, Father, that you would overshadow us with your Holy Spirit and birth us, Lord Jesus, into the the Holies of Holies, Father, that we would see you high and lifted up. For truly, Lord, our desire as Christians, Father, is to be made more like you, Lord, there's a lot of things that we could look out there in the world and we could see a lot of things being made in this hour. But Lord, we want to be made like you with everything that's within us, our children, our our aspects of our family life, our Christianity. We desire, Lord Jesus, to be close to you so much, Father, that one of these days we'll take a walk like Enoch did, and we'll walk right off of this world, Father, and we'll live a life that had been so pleasing to you, Father, that you could not leave us here. So, Father, as we go through thy word tonight, we invite you, Father, to be the author of it and take us through it. Lord Jesus, guide us tonight. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ. And the bride said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Joel chapter 2 and verse 25. And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, the caterpillar, and the Palmerworm. my great army which I sent amongst you. Isaiah 54 verse 1-7. We'll be reading it from the amplified version again. Amen. Do you have it this evening? The Bible says, "Shout for joy, O barren one. She who has not given birth, break forth into joyful shouting and rejoice." I love that. Don't you rejoice? I believe if there ever was an hour for the bride of Christ to rejoice, it's right now. She who has not gone into labor with child, for with the spiritual sons of the desolate one will be more numerous than the sons of the married woman, saith the Lord. Enlarge the size of your tent to make room for more children. Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not spare them. Lengthen your tent ropes and make your peg stakes firm in the ground. For you will spread out to the right and to the left. Tell the devil to give you some elbow room. And your descendants will take possession of nations and will inhabit the deserted cities. Do not fear for you will not be put to shame. And do not feel humiliated or ashamed for you will not be disgraced. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord. For you will not forget the shame of your youth. For you will forget the shame of your youth. And you will no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood. For your husband is your maker. The Lord of hosts is his name. And your redeemer is the holy one of Israel who is called the son who is called the God of the whole earth. For the Lord has called you like a wife who has been abandoned, grieved in spirit, and like a wife married in her youth, when she is later rejected and scorned, says your God. For a brief moment, I abandon you, but with great compassion and mercy, I will gather you to myself again. Amen. May God bless his word tonight. You may be seated here tonight in the presence of the Lord. Have you come expecting this weekend? &gt;&gt; I'd like to just for a few minutes tonight just to rebuild on some things that we were speaking last weekend and and continue our thought on I will restore and restoring the barren. We look here and we just look at this definition of barrenness again. It is the quality of not producing its kind of want or the power of conception. It it means to be unfruitful. It means to be sterile and have infertility. It's the quality of not producing at all whether in small quantities or in big quantities. We you see that it means it it baroness means want of invention or the want of power of producing anything new. And I I love this this part of the definition of it. It is defect of emotion, sensibility or ferveny as the baroness of devotion. You begin to think about this thought and there's many ways that you could look at the thought on barrenness. But what you what barreness can look like is because barrenness a lot of times is broader than we would look at maybe at a womb of a of a mother. It can appear many of times as physical barrenness where the it has the inability to bring forth life or to produce fruit of the ground. Then there is when you look in the Bible you will see a spiritual barrenness that God would lace throughout his word that there would be dryness and there would be times of silence and times of weariness when people are in a state of barrenness where God is not go where where they feel like God has left them. And then there's a time where you would look and you would see where where people would see barrenness in their time of a relationship with the Almighty where it would look like they're when they are in a spot when God is delaying his promise to come to pass or they feel like they're they're being isolated or they are in a space of of brokenness. And then there you can see that there are times and seasons of seasonal barrenness. When you look in there and see that a promise has been spoken over a certain situation, but nothing has yet just happened. But we realize that God addresses every type of barrenness through his word. Can you say amen tonight? And we realize that we we are facing an enemy that he likes to make us and make us feel like we are not producing what God has intended us to do. But we also realize that there is a baroness where the enemy comes in and attacks the land or attacks the field or attacks a a womb and tries to lock up that womb or that field from being able to produce and to bring forth. But we look and also see that God allows Baroness in certain conditions in certain cases. You remember when Aimilec had had taken Sarah to be his wife. You remember there that God had visited AMC in a dream and told him said now if you don't restore the man his wife then I'm going to lock up all the wounds of all your city. So God was telling Aimilec that if you don't release her that your kingdom will become completely perilous. they'll they'll completely not be able to produce and not go forward. Your your kingdom will be a complete demise. And you also remember that there was a woman by the name of Michelle that was David's wife. How that that that was David's first wife, his first love. And you remember when David was dancing 17 miles backwards under true worship because he saw the message of the hour coming back to its rightful position again. And she looked out there upon David in that true worship and she made fun of it. And you remember that in that MOMENT THAT GOD SPOKE AND HE CURSED HER WOMB THAT SHE COULD no further bring forth children from her own womb no more. So we realize that there is A BARONESS THAT GOD ALLOWS. BUT WE ALSO REALIZE this that we are living in an hour where Jesus speaks about the hour that you and I are living in where we see that there is a spiritual barrenness that is upon the face OF THE EARTH. YOU look at it and you see the condition of mothers and you see these things. Do you know that our sisters that you can take great courage is that this is the hour that Jesus talked about in the book of Luke chapter 23 and 27. The Bible said that there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus turning unto them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me." Hallelujah. But weep for yourselves and for your children. But for behold, THE DAYS ARE COMING IN WHICH they shall say, "Blessed are the barren, and the wounds that shall never that never bear, and the paths which never GAVE SUCK." THEN SHALL they begin to say, "The mountains fall upon us, and the hills to cover us." Now, brother picks that up in the invisible union. He says, speaking of the day that women would no more want children. They want a dog or a cat or SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT SHE DON'T WANT ANY CHILDREN ANYMORE. WHY? SHE'S an old mother hubard. IF SHE HAS A CHILD, SHE DON'T WANT That's the That's the remarks of Hollywood. It don't want this woman to it does it don't want the his woman to be an old mother hubard. OH, SHE'LL HAVE SOME KIND of an operation performed on herself that'll keep her from having children. THEY DON'T WANT NO CHILDREN. JESUS SPOKE OF IT. WHAT DID HE SAY? AT THAT time they shall begin to cry for the rocks and the mountains to fall on them. NOTICE HE SAID SHE'LL PRACTICE BIRTH CONTROL SO THAT SHE CAN go to parties. SHE CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH A BABY NURSING HER. It'll disform her when she's pregnantated. It'll be it'll disform her. She won't look like she's you like she USED TO. HALLELUJAH. AND HER HUSBAND ignorant enough to let her go that way. SHE WON'T GIVE HIM A CHILD. JESUS SPOKE OF IT. HE SAID THAT THAT WOMEN WHEN THEY GET THERE that when they were doing this is at the time when they to go to crying for the rocks to FALL ON THEM. HE SAID IT'S the coming of the Lord. WHEN YOU SEE THESE DAYS ARE COMING, YOU RECOGNIZE, SISTERS, when you are desiring to be A MOTHER. YOU LOOK AND REALIZE THAT YOU'RE IN THE GREATEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE IN THE GREATEST TIME OF YOUR LIFE. YOU'RE AT THE COMING OF THE LORD. IT MAY NOT BE A GREAT TIME FOR SOME OF YOU, BUT FOR ME, IT'S THE BEST TIME IN THE WORLD TO BE LIVING AT. I KNOW FOR SOME OF YOU MOTHERS, it's never been able to BRING FORTH AND DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES IN YOUR LIFE. BUT YOU LOOK OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AND YOU SEE ALL THESE DISCREPANCIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW, IT'S A TIME TO REJOICE. &gt;&gt; IT'S A TIME TO REJOICE. IT'S THE COMING OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; It's amazing time to be living. Absolutely amazing time because women are not wanting to bring forth and the church is in the same condition. But I thank God for good Christian mamas. I thank God for our sisters that long to be mothers. and you look out there and you see these godly examples of what it's like to be have a mother like like Moses's mother that would raise him up there and teach him of those different things and would raise him up to realize that he was born for A PURPOSE. I THANK GOD FOR women that desire to still bring forth children because I believe that there is something when you study THE SCRIPTURES WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW TO BE a mama or not or whether you know how to be a daddy or not. I know. I know this is THAT IF YOU READ THIS BIBLE, it'll teach you how to be a mama. It'll teach you how to be a daddy. IF YOU COULD JUST GO BACK TO SPENDING TIME WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE WORD, IT'LL TEACH YOU how to be a REAL MAMA. YOU LOOK AT THESE SISTERS OUT HERE. WHAT GIVE THEM THAT DESIRE TO BE A MOTHER? IT WAS OUR HEAVENLY FATHER THAT PUT THAT ON THE INSIDE OF THEM BECAUSE GOD LONGS TO BE A FATHER. HE LOVED FATHERHOOD. SO, HE HAD HIMSELF A CHILD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I love it. I LOVE CHILDREN. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE THAT GET so disturbed by children. They get so disturbed because I WENT INTO A PLACE ONE TIME AND I vowed I'd never go back there. It had a little sign or little place or a restaurant that said no children are welcome. I thought, well, this ain't a place for me. Ain't a place for me. IF THEY IF MY CHILDREN AIN'T WELCOME, then I ain't welcome &gt;&gt; because I'm the biggest kid in my family. BUT YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL WHEN YOU GO TO STUDYING OUT CHILDREN. There's a lot of people There's a lot of people that don't like children in church. But I'll say this, IF YOU AIN'T GOT CHILDREN IN CHURCH, YOU GOT A DEAD CHURCH. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people THAT GET DISTURBED BECAUSE CHILDREN playing in churches. Well, there's a place, AND THAT'S YOUR JOB AS MOTHER AND FATHERS to flick them on top of the head and get them back in line. But I'll SAY THIS, IT DON'T BOTHER ME one bit. It don't bother me one bit. If we don't have those little ones crawling around and playing all over the place, THEN THIS PLACE IS DEAD. WELL, if you don't want children in church, well, better go down there to the Methodist church WHERE THEY AIN'T THEY AIN'T GOT NO CHILDREN. THEY AIN'T GOT NO YOUTH. THEY AIN'T GOT NO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SERVE GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE GOT THIS YOUTH GROUP AROUND AROUND HERE, BUT I DO THAT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT THAT AIN'T A PROGRAM TO KEEP CHILDREN IN CHURCH. THAT'S JUST AN ADDED BENEFIT TO THEIR CAME TO CHURCH AND BEING BLESSING BY OTHERS, BUT THAT AIN'T SOMETHING TO KEEP THEM IN LINE. I know a personal FRIEND OF MINE. I KNOW A PERSONAL FRIEND OF MINE THAT IS PAID. HE IS A PAID GUY TO GO AROUND TO MAKE SURE HE IS A PERSONAL SOCIALIZER of the church to make sure that PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED AND THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. IT'S A PROGRAM TO KEEP THEM IN CHURCH. But I found out the only program that I need here for GOSPEL LIGHTHOUSE IS TO PREACH the message of the hour. I hear people say, "HOW DO YOU GET YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO ACT THAT WAY AND HAVE THAT KIND OF RESPECT AND DEMONSTRATE THAT KIND OF CHARACTER?" WELL, THERE'S NOTHING I DID. ALL I SIMPLY DID WAS PREACH THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE THING TO DO WITH WHAT BROTHER RON DID OR BROTHER HOMER DID. IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Don't you love children? &gt;&gt; I love what the Bible said in Psalms 127 and three. Lo children are inheritance of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. Psalms 128 and3 said, "Thy wife shall be as fruitful vine by the sides of thine house. Thy children like the olive plants round about thy table." God loves his children. AND YOU LOOK AT MA MARK 10:16, IT SAID THAT HE TOOK THEM IN his arms, the little children, and he put his hands UPON THEM AND HE BLESSED THEM. GOD JESUS ALMIGHTY LOVED TO bring children unto him. So Jesus was a youth leader. LUKE 18 AND 16. BUT JESUS CALLED THEM UNTO HIM AND SAID SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME. YOU SEE THERE IS SOMETHING POWERFUL. THERE IS SOMETHING POWERFUL IN GOD'S MIND ABOUT BEING A CHILD. GOD LOVES CHILDLIKE FAITH. THERE'S SOMETHING POWERFUL WHEN YOU GO TO STUDYING CHILDLIKE FAITH. NOW, CHILDLIKE FAITH IS NOT CHILDISH FAITH, BUT CHILDLIKE FAITH IS TO BE LIKE A CHILD. NOTICE WHAT JESUS SAID IN MATTHEW 8:3, "VERILY, I say unto you, EXCEPT YOU BE CONVERTED AND BECOME AS LITTLE CHILDREN, YOU SHALL NOT ENTER IN TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD." SO, WHAT DOES CHILDLIKE FAITH LOOK LIKE? What does it look like? Do you want to GET A PICTURE OF WHAT CHILDLIKE FAITH LOOKS LIKE? GO TO MATTHEW 21:16 THAT IT SAID, "OUT OF THE MOUTH OF BABES AND SUCKLINGS, THOU HAS PERFECTED PRAISE." SO IF YOU WANT CHILDLIKE FAITH, THEN YOU GOT TO GO BACK TO PERFECT PRAISE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, CHILDLIKE FAITH IS NOT IGNORANCE. CHILDLIKE FAITH IS NOT IGNORANCE, BUT CHILDLIKE FAITH IS TRUST WITHOUT COMPLICATION. IT'S LIKE I WAS SPEAKING TO YOU A FEW WEEKENDS AGO ON TOUCH OF JESUS, TOUCHING JESUS LIKE THAT LITTLE BITTY BABY THAT IF IT'S EVER GET PUT BACK IN THE HANDS OF ITS MAMA, IT GETS LAID THERE ON THAT BOSOM OF THAT MOTHER. THAT THAT THAT LITTLE BABY HAS FULL CONFIDENCE THAT THAT MOTHER IS GOING TO SATISFY ALL OF ITS NEEDS. THAT'S WHY ABRAHAM RESTED OVER ON THE BOSOM OF EL SHADI BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT HE COULD LAY UPON HIM AND OUT OF HIM HE WOULD PULL A NEW BODY. &gt;&gt; You see now you're going to produce something. If you're going to have a wedlock then you're going to produce something. He went on to say in invisible union he said if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat something. He said she's got to mother something. It's her nature. But to bear a child for her husband and raise it to the service of God, that's entirely all out of her line. She should Oh, she'd be so disgraced if she did by her sinloving society of this 1965 type of woman. He said it's a TRUE TYPE OF THE modern church today. Neither does the modern church want any of these here. Screaming, shouting, tongue speaking. Acts 2:38, young is around her. Yeah, she don't want any of them whooping, crying, and screaming. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. WHY SUCH A CHILD WOULD IMMEDIATELY PUT HER out of HER DENOMINATIONS? THEY HAD ONLY ONE. THEY HAD ONE LIKE THAT IN THE ONE of the churches. WHY? THEY'D THROW HER OUT RIGHT QUICK. WHY ARE YOU LETTING SUCH STUFF AS THIS GO ALONG? SO, you see, she's pregnantated with something. NOTICE SHE'S PREGNANTATED WITH SOMETHING BECAUSE SHE'S BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS all the time. But she don't want NONE OF THEM SCREAMING, HOLLERING, BLABBERING. ACTS 2:38, MISERABLE CREATURES THAT SHE THINKS THEY ARE. NOTICE THIS IS NOT [screaming] WHAT GOD THINKS, BUT THIS IS WHAT THE MODERN CHURCH THINKS OF HER, that she thinks they are. It would certainly embarrass her. It would ruin her and her uneducated, ETHICAL, SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY CHURCH THAT SHE BELONGED TO HERE. THEY WOULD THROW HER OUT AT THE NEXT council council. She can't have it. She don't want to be pregnantated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth, born of THE SPIRIT OF GOD. IT HAS A SPIRIT OF GOD IN IT. NO INTELLECTUAL CHURCH JOIN AND CREEK GOING, BOBBED HAIR, PAINTED FACE. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AT IT AT ALL. YOU DON'T FIND THAT IN the word of God. You find an oldfashioned sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit. GOD SCREAMING, HOLLERING, SHOUTING, PRAISING GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S one of my favorite quotes cuz I don't fit in with that modern world. But you notice the power of deception right here. Notice she IS PREGNANTATED BECAUSE SHE'S BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS ALL THE TIME. AND THE CHURCH THINKS THAT SHE'S CONSTANTLY GROWING BECAUSE THERE'S MORE MEMBERS THAN EVER BEFORE, a million more and all these DIFFERENT THINGS AND ALWAYS HAVING A CONSTANT THING. BUT THEY'RE NEVER PRODUCING LIFE. Are you with me? THEY'RE NOT PRODUCING LIFE, SO THEY'RE BRINGING FORTH HYBRID MEMBERS. SO, WE RECOGNIZE THAT SHE IS BEING PREGNANT WITH THE WRONG KIND OF SEED because if it was true seed, then it would manifest the same life that came from the husband. So, we recognize it is in our mothers to bring forth life. It's in our mothers to mother something. It's the same way on the inside of the bride of Jesus Christ. She can't explain it, but she's wanting to bring forth something. She can't explain it, but she's still hungering for something. She can't explain it, but she's still wanting the supernatural. She can't explain it, but she's wanting to produce the supernatural. She can't explain it, BUT SHE STILL BELIEVES IN THE SUPERNATURAL. SHE STILL BELIEVES IN HEALING. SHE STILL BELIEVES IN SIGNS AND WONDERS FOLLOWING THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. SHE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF HER. He went on to say in a spoken word is the original seed. He said, "Now Abram, excuse me, Adam's bride could not wait." He said, "BUT SHE MINGLED HER SEED ILLEGALLY." ILLEGALLY. We are supposed to believe God's word AND THAT ALONE. NOW, BRETHREN, HERE AND on the tape, DO YOU SEE WHY I'M CONTENDING FOR THAT WORD? word by word. So if we're going to bring forth anything, THEN IT'S GOT TO BE BUILT UPON THE WORD. JESUS BELIEVED ALL THAT WAS WRITTEN OF HIM AND HE MANIFESTED EVERYTHING THAT WAS WRITTEN OF HIM. So if we're going to live IN THIS HOUR, THEN WE'VE GOT TO MANIFEST the word that is for our portion. WE'VE WE GOT TO WAIT ON IT. But Eve couldn't wait. She got in a hurry. How many times have you got in a hurry? How many times did you think that God needed your help BECAUSE YOU HAD SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU AND JUST BECAUSE IT'S A RIGHTEOUS DESIRE DOESN'T MAKE IT ALWAYS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? TRYING TO DO GOD A SERVICE WITHOUT BEING IN his will. SO SOMETIMES IT'S THE RIGHT THING, BUT IT'S AT THE WRONG TIME. But notice, Eve couldn't wait. There was something on the inside of her brother Doug, where she longed to be a mother because God gave her that great desire to be a mother, &gt;&gt; but she couldn't wait. But I love what the prophet said, and it is the rising of the sun. AND GOD KNOWS, HALLELUJAH, HE'S GOT A PRESENT PREDESTINATED FOR ORDAINED CHURCH. HE KNOWS HE'S GOT SONS AND DAUGHTERS AND A BRIDE WAITING. A BRIDE WAITING SOMEWHERE. WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT BEGINS TO FLY OVER IT, THAT WAVE CHIEF, OH MY, HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. NOT SOME MYTHICAL STORY, BUT A REALITY. YOU'RE NOT OUT THERE GETTING AHEAD OF THE PROGRAM, BUT YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE WAVE SHEATH, THE MESSAGE TO COME ACROSS YOUR LIFE TO PRODUCE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEVER COULD. If we would have WEIGHED IT, &gt;&gt; WE WOULDN'T have been in this chaos. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, Brother Andrew? If you want to break barrenness, you got to go through God's program. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, Brother Andrew? I'm saying this is THAT IF YOU'LL STAY IN LINE, IF YOU'LL STAY RIGHT IN LINE WITH GOD'S WORD, THE PROPHET SAID STAY IN LINE. YOU NOTICE THERE'S A BRIDE WAITING. THERE'S A BRIDE WAITING. THERE'S A BRIDE IN POSITION. THERE'S A BRIDE THAT'S GOING TO BRING FORTH. THERE'S A BRIDE THAT'S GOING TO MANIFEST GOD'S POWER. AND WHEN YOU GET TO A SPOT WHERE YOU ARE DEALING WITH CONSTANTLY A BARONESS IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU HAVE MOMENTS OF HIGH SPOTS AND LOW SPOTS, WELL, BROTHER, YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO AHEAD AND GET ON A ROLLER COASTER BECAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THEM THINGS. BUT WHERE YOU BREAK IT AT IS WHEN YOU SPEND TIME WITH THE AUTHOR OF THIS WORD. &gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot of people [panting] that look like the real deal. There's a lot of people that look like real seed. THERE'S A LOT OF people where the message of the hour was cast upon the ground, but it fell on rocks and it fell in thorns and it took the very life out of the seed. But God knows who's waiting. &gt;&gt; Notice he went on to say in a spoken word. HE SAID, "WHEN ADAM COME TO HIS WIFE, SHE WAS PREGNANT. SHE HAD DONE SOMETHING. SHE WAS MIXED. SHE WAS A HYBRID, a child, and had died. BUT WHEN JOSEPH COME TO HIS BRIDE, SHE WAS PREGNANTATED WITH LIFE." HALLELUJAH. ADAM'S WIFE OR HIS ADAM'S BRIDE BEFORE THEY COME TOGETHER JUST LIKE JOSEPH AND MARY JUST LIKE CHRIST IN THE CHURCH NOW. DO YOU SEE IT? AND BEFORE THEY COME TOGETHER, ADAM AND EVE, SHE WAS PREGNANTATED WITH A CORRUPT SEED FROM THE SERPENT. AND WHEN ADAM COME TO HIS WIFE, HE FOUND HER PREGNANT to death. Death how? Spiritually and physically dead. BUT WHEN JOSEPH THE HUMAN COME TO HIS WIFE, GLORY, HE SAID, I HE can't hardly hold her. She was pregnantated with life. THE WORD OF GOD, THE FLESH IN HER WOMB. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. WHAT A CONTRAST. WHEN ADAM WENT TO EVE, SHE WAS PREGNANTATED TO DEATH. BUT WHEN JOSEPH WENT TO MARY, WHAT DID HE FIND? SHE WAS PREGNANTATED WITH LIFE. WHEN CHRIST COME IN THIS HOUR, THIS MESSAGE BROKE THE BARNESS OVER YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT PREGNANTATED WITH DEATH. YOU'RE PREGNANTATED WITH LIFE. My goodness. How did the prophet say it? And your life is sealed off where no other life can get on the inside of there. There ain't no power that can get on the inside of that. No devil CAN GET IN THERE THAT CAN TORMENT you and sew a seed OF DISCREPANCY BECAUSE A MESSAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN SOWN. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO REJECT WHAT GOD HAS PUT ON THE INSIDE OF YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Philippians 2:5 says, "Let this mind BE IN YOU WHICH WAS ALSO IN CHRIST JESUS." BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID IN A SPOKEN WORD, HE SAID, "IF YOU LET THE MIND OF A DENOMINATION come in, YOU'LL BE DENOMINATIONAL PREGNANT." HE SAID, "BUT IF YOU LET the mind of Christ come into you, HE CAN'T DENY HIS OWN WORD CUZ HE'S GOD. YOU BE PREGNANT WITH THE WORD." &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE, THIS BRIDE IS NOT CARRYING AROUND SOME DOCTRINE. She's not carrying AROUND ANOTHER CHURCH. SHE'S NOT carrying around a different book. SHE'S CARRYING AROUND JESUS. &gt;&gt; LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR. SAY, "I'M PREGNANT." &gt;&gt; BROTHERS, that's the first time I believe we have defied all of science tonight. I'm pregnant &gt;&gt; and I'm full term. That's funny, ain't it? But I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; I got something on the inside of me &gt;&gt; and I didn't put it there. &gt;&gt; I just got in position for a miracle to come by my way. Let me say this to you. You got yourself in position when the message of the hour come by your way. Let me say this TO YOU. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT YOU DID. YOU WAS ELECTED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD TO BE PRED PREDESTINATED TO CARRY THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; AND I'M PREGNANT AND I'M FULLTERM. AND LET ME SAY SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. IT'S WORKING ON THE OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant. &gt;&gt; Mary couldn't hide it but for so long. There's a lot of people that's going around claiming that they're pregnant with the message, &gt;&gt; but they ain't nothing showing on the outside. &gt;&gt; I got all you laughing, but now I got you where I want you. &gt;&gt; YOU SAID YOU WAS PREGNANT, BUT IS [screaming] YOUR LIFE SHOWING &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU'RE PREGNANTATED WITH? &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. AT SOME TIME IN YOUR LIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH BIRTH PAINS AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET INTO A SPOT WHERE THINGS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE. &gt;&gt; If you're pregnant, THEN THAT MEANS ONLY ONE THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE BIRTH. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HAS GOT TO COME OUT OF THE FRUIT OF THY WOMB. SOMETHING HAS GOT TO MANIFEST. AND TOO many times we produce stillborn children because we got churches or we go and we feel like we need a church that their spiritual phen thermometer is 32 below zero and they can't ever get themsel into a place where they rejoice IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. BUT THE PROPHET SAID THIS IN THE SEVENTH SEAL THAT WHEN THE SUPERNATURAL COMES IN THAT IS THE MIND OF CHRIST. LET ME SAY THIS TO YOU. THIS CHURCH IS NOT PREGNANTATED WITH SOME DOGMA OR SOME HYBRID CREED. THIS CHURCH IS PREGNANTATED WITH THE SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; Now look at your neighbor and say, "I'm pregnant." And y'all ain't getting used to this. That just feels funny. No, I know exactly what I'm talking about. I GOT SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD CAN'T HAVE AND THE WORLD DIDN'T GIVE ME. THE CHURCH DOWN THE ROAD DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS. SOME IDEA DIDN'T GIVE ME THIS. I RECEIVED SEED FROM THE HUSBAND. &gt;&gt; I'm pregnant. Maybe we should title it that I'm pregnant. That that ought to get us some clicks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not going to believe this. That pastor down there, Full Gospel Lighthouse, he is defying all odds. It'll be on Fox News and CNN tomorrow morning. MAN CLAIMS HE'S PREGNANT. WELL, I GOT SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD REALLY NEEDS. [applause] I want you TO KNOW THAT YOUR ENTIRE SUPERNATURAL OR YOUR SPIRITUAL birth is COMPLETELY SUPERNATURAL. IT'S A PARADOX THAT YOU'RE A VIRGIN. YOU'RE A VIRGIN. YOU KNOW THIS THAT GOD RETURNS YOU BACK TO YOUR INNOCENCY AND YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT. YOU'RE A VIRGIN, BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT. YOU'VE BEEN WITH A HUSBAND, BUT YOU'RE A VIRGIN. YOUR MIND IS VIRGIN. YOUR SOUL IS VIRGIN. YOUR SPIRIT IS VIRGIN. YOU'VE NOT BEEN MANHANDLED. YOU'VE NOT BEEN MAN ABUSED. YOU HAVE BEEN A VIRGIN FROM THE MIND OF GOD. NO MAN DID YOU WRONG. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you young girls. You say, "Well, they this should be the daddy's job." Well, some of them don't have daddies. IF SOME MAN IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR VIRGIN, RUN AWAY FROM THAT MAN. &gt;&gt; KEEP YOURSELF LET ME SAY THIS. IF SOME CHURCH IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR VIRGIN, RUN. [screaming] THIS MESSAGE MAKES YOU VIRGIN. It makes you spotless. What was it when THE PROPHET WAS UP THERE IN THEM COLORADO MOUNTAINS? HE WAS UP THERE IN THEM VIRGIN TIMBERS AND HE SAW THE SUPERNATURAL COME DOWN. No man had ever touched it up there. And all of a sudden, Elohim capped it off with his life and said, "Would you like to WALK WITH ME?" &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE WAS WALKING [screaming] IN A SPACE OF URGENCY. [panting] I say the son of man's still walking this hour. He's still walking through your life. And he's here to break the barrenness. IF YOU CAN'T BRING FORTH, THE SON OF MAN IS HERE TO BRING IT. IF YOU CANNOT MANIFEST, THE SON OF MAN IS HERE TO BREAK IT. &gt;&gt; [sighs] &gt;&gt; I absolutely love this word because it causes us to look to the future by taking us back to God's promises and projecting our faith to a place projecting our faith to a place where we look to his promise because we realize that God has a certain intended space where his promise is going to be made manifest. Brother Mam said in Jehovah Gyra, he said one day when Abraham was sitting out there, he said the land was barren, he said sometimes we think that those things are curses. He said no. If you know your heart's right with God, no matter what happens, stay right with it. Ain't that a trick of the enemy? Just because things aren't going the way that you think they should and it looks like a stage of barrenness that the enemy like to make you think that's a curse. You've been cursed, sister. You got a curse over your life. If you was a real Christian, I've heard this. I've heard I've heard so-called message people, preachers sit there and say that to OUR SISTERS BECAUSE THEY'RE not able to bring forth children. There's a curse over their life. That is a false doctrine right from hell. THIS MESSAGE RESTORES YOU AND IT ROLLS AWAY YOUR REPROACH. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BARREN DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU'RE CURSED. IT JUST MEANS YOU'RE IN A STAGE OF YOUR LIFE WHERE THE MANIFESTATION CAN BE SET UP FOR THE SUPERNATURAL. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. I don't care if you're 50 YEARS OLD. IF GOD SAID [screaming] OVER YOUR LIFE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BRING FORTH, WELL, YOU SAY, "WELL, Brother Andrew, that's impossible." Talk to Sarah about it. &gt;&gt; Come on, TALK TO ABRAHAM ABOUT IT. ABRAHAM WASN'T CURSED. ABRAHAM WAS THE MOST BLESSED MAN THAT EVER WALKED IN SHOE LEATHER AT THAT TIME. BUT GOD HAD PUT A BLESSING OVER HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; But the enemy sat there and laughed at him. Said, "Oh, you're going to be a father of nations, huh? Where's them children at? You know, there's a prophet that stood in this hour and there was a sister that stood in line. And the prophet told her, said, "Look," he told her in the prayer line that she was going to bring forth a healthy boy. And she got outside and got her hanging around the wrong churches. See, it's it's powerful who you make your friends and who you make your enemies. And she got to hang around with the wrong crowd. And they begin to talk about William Brandham. They said all kinds of different things AND SEWED DOUBT INTO HER mind and said instead OF SEWING SEEDS OF ACCURACY, they sowed seeds of doubt there and told her said these things will be and she got some awful disease and and many many years later her husband come back through the prayer line and met brother man through a circumstance and he was there and he told HER SAID MY MY WIFE IS IN THIS CONDITION THIS THIS LIES BEEN TOLD ABOUT YOU AND DIFFERENT THINGS. He said, "IT WAS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD she was going to have that baby, wasn't it?" He said, "THEN TELL HER THAT SHE'S GOING TO BRING forth a son. It wasn't no more than 12 months later she had a 8 POUND BABY BOY AT SOME 50SOME YEAR OLD AGE." &gt;&gt; WELL, God must still be God then. &gt;&gt; I love what brother Brandham said. [sighs] How about in Jehovah Gyra? He said, "She was barren, but Abraham was sterile." So God didn't just work on Sarah. He had to work on Abraham. I think I I'd like to just draw your attention right here. Is that Abraham's 75 and she's 65. at the time of the promise in Genesis 12. You look at those things [snorts] and I I'd like to tie that to many of our Christian walk is that Abraham tried on his own for 25 years. He tried on his own for 25 years. But barrenness will bring you to a spot where you realize that you've got to be fully dependent on the Almighty. Well, you can tie that right to Hagar and typing it to the new birth. Is that you will try to produce something in your own Christian walk to bring forth the message of the hour and you'll try to work it up. You'll go to the altar. You'll pray. You'll cry. You'll boohoo. and he'll sit there in a spot of sanctification and never go all the way. And just because you brought forth an Ishmamail does not mean that you have felt you have fallen through in the promises of God that everything's going correct. Let me say this to you. You can never go all the way in the rapture by just producing an Israel. You've got to go all the way. And you can try to do this on your own. You can try to figure this out on your own. You can try TO WORK IT OUT and read all the help self-help books all that you want to. You can read THROUGH EVERY IDEOLOGY OUT THERE. YOU CAN LOOK AT EVERY SCRIPTURE AND YOU CAN STUDY IT IN SUCH A way where you feel like you are acquainted WITH THE ALMIGHTY. YOU CAN GET TO A SPOT WHERE YOU FEEL self-sufficient &gt;&gt; and you're not going to make it. Let me say this to you. IF YOU'RE IN THAT TYPE OF CONDITION, PREPARE FOR THE TRIBULATION, [snorts] &gt;&gt; where you think you're okay, &gt;&gt; where you think you CAN DO IT ON YOUR OWN, &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GO FURTHER. YOU CAN'T DO THIS ON YOUR OWN. YOU CAN NEVER BRING FORTH AN ISAAC ON YOUR OWN. YOU CAN NEVER GET THE HOLY GHOST ON YOUR OWN. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT [screaming] TO DIE. ABRAHAM, YOU'VE DONE THIS ALL ALONE ON YOUR OWN. IT'S TIME THAT YOU HAVE A MEETING WITH THIS MELZDC. &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM TRIED FOR 25 YEARS, BUT ONE MOMENT, ONE MOMENT, BROTHER ISAAC, IN THE PRESENCE OF MELCHAZDC, IT CHANGED HIM FOREVER. &gt;&gt; How powerful was this change that when Sarah died, Abraham had seven more children. HE DID SOMETHING TO ABRAHAM. Maybe lock the doors. SOMETHING HAD CHANGED. SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO ABRAHAM. HE HAD been changed. &gt;&gt; You know good and well. Well, let me go on. Somebody's trying to lock a door on me. You could not break the spirit of barness on your own. You see why Satan hates our mother so much. It's because he fears what that seed will become. You see, to many of people, Joseph was just a teenager that was full of dreams. But in God's supernatural mind, he had already already saw him already saw him as a ruler over Israel. Now notice what the prophet said in a smirking church age. I'm jumping down brothers and sisters. He said in Exodus 13 and 13, he said, "Every first of an ass thou shalt redeem and when and with a lamb thou will not redeem it." Every first of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb. And if thou wil not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck, and all the firstborn among man, thy children shalt thou redeemed. He said, see the ass can be redeemed. Every miserable sinner can be redeemed by the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ or in rejecting Christ be rejected himself. But you don't redeem the mule. There is no redemption for him. There is no blood for him. There can't be. Because the mule takes refuge in the church while the ass takes refuge in the blood. The mule has NO SEED IN HIM THAT CAN BE QUICKENED, BUT THE ASS has seat. So what you're carrying puts YOU IN POSITION FOR A MIRACLE. IT PUTS YOU IN A MESSAGE OR A PLACE OF POSITION TO BE RESTORED OR TO BE MADE ALIVE. When you look at where we just where we draw this whole thought on breaking barness back in Judges chapter 13, you go to looking at that and I I I really studied that from a different different angle than I've ever looked at it before is that when God begins to open up that scripture in Judges 13. you look at it is that God does not introduce He does not introduce the chapter as Samson the great hero that is a hero that is waiting but he introduces that chapter as a God who God God as a God who moves his children INTO IMPOSSIBLE PLACES AND BRINGS THEM TO A place where they remember what they were built for. You see, there was a condition on Monoah's wife and she was BARREN FROM THIS SPOT. AND GOD LOOKED AT THAT CONDITION BEFORE HE EVER SPOKE ABOUT the deliverer. You look at Judges 13, you will see that IT WAS IN A TIME of the church of the judges, like the church ages, where every man just did what was right in his own sight. And there they were in a spot of barrenness. The entry point INTO [clears throat] JUDGES 13 WAS THAT THERE WAS A POLITICAL BARRENNESS, there was a SPIRITUAL BARRENNESS, AND THERE WAS A physical barrenness of Monoah's wife. BUT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS, THAT ONE VISITATION addressed all three OF THE BARREN TYPES THAT was in that church. AND WHEN THEY GOT TO THIS POSITION, THEY RECOGNIZED THEY COULD NOT TAKE CREDIT for bringing FORTH SAMSON. THEY COULD NOT BRING FORTH THE CREDIT TO SAY THAT THEY WERE GREATER THAN THE PHILISTINE ARMY. THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE OUTCOME THAT WAS GETTING READY TO COME. BUT GOD BROKE THE barrenness by bringing forth seed. So it means that only life can come from God. Let me say this. You're not forgotten. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're in position. &gt;&gt; And I I I really hope that you hear me tonight. There's got to be a turning point. Whether it's in your mind or you start speaking it until you believe it. There's got to be a turning point. There's got to be a spot in your life where you look and you act upon the word. and had come to that position. They couldn't do this on earth. You face them sane Philistines because spirits never die. They want to steal, to kill, and destroy. Tomorrow, I'm going to dig into those those four bugs just a little bit. But I want you to know that before you can ever get to a place where you break barrenness, you got to get the atmosphere just right. That everything's got to be just right. It's got to be the right time. It's got to be with fertile seed. It's got to be in a place where God can manifest his glory. So, you've got to come. Let me say it to you like this. You got to come to church expected. &gt;&gt; You got to have a prayer life at home. &gt;&gt; You got to be in a position where the message is not foreign to you. But you understand, you understand what is getting ready to take place. You set the atmosphere. And when you set the atmosphere, that's where the supernatural can take place. Anybody that's a farmer knows that it takes the right kind of an atmosphere to bring forth the right kind of a crop. It takes good ground. It takes good sunlight. It takes moisture. It takes all of these conditions. And I want you to know the best condition to get yourself to break barrenness is repentance. &gt;&gt; Is repentance. It's the zeal of this hour, young people. If you want to break the baroness where you constantly are, I I I'm living right. I'm doing right. I I I feel like I feel like I'm really having a breakthrough. I I I really felt the Holy Ghost move. If you really want to break that where you're constantly on up and down, just repent. I know that's real, real simple, but I want you to notice notice this. I never went to no schooling to figure out how to be a preacher. I never went to school into how to figure out how to be a Christian. I never went to school in how to learn how to study the message. I never went to those schools. But I tell you what I did do. I got myself in position. Your position might be in this church. Your position might be in your car. Your position might be right here at this altar. And if you want to be in position for a miracle, then repent. &gt;&gt; Because I can tell you this. I was barren and I was dry and I was weary and I was wore out. But when I begin to repent, something broke over my life. What was it? I WAS HARD AS ALL GET OUT. And there's many times where people go through that spot of sanctification and they're hard and they just let the word roll over them and it doesn't do anything to them. and they'll go through a stage of their Christian walk. And I know I'm speaking to somebody right now, but I I just want to make this uh broad. So, I'm not so I'm not just a uh speaking to one individual, but you go through those spots. You go through those spots where you feel like you're all alone and you feel like you're you you can't make it on your own and you then you get you get yourself you get your head above water just enough where you can breathe again. And before long, Satan comes along again and he dunks you back under and you you feel that pressure to get back up. There's something there that you're trying to get out of. But what is it? You still got some fight on the inside of you. And if you got some fight to get above the waters where Satan's trying to drown you with that shows there's SOMETHING VALUABLE ON THE INSIDE OF YOU, JUST FIGHT TO GET YOUR HEAD BACK UP. GET BACK TO THAT SPOT. AND WHEN YOU GET BACK UP THERE, LET THE LIFE OF THE HOLY GHOST BREAK OVER YOU. [sighs] So get yourself in position for the miracle. Abraham and Sarah got themselves in position. Monoah and his wife got themsel in position by taking the angel's words. The widow of Zerapath got herself in position by simply acting upon the word OF GOD. JONAH GOT HIMSELF in position by accepting the word that told him that if he would turn his face towards THAT TEMPLE THAT GOD would hear his prayer. HALLELUJAH. PETER GOT HIMSELF IN POSITION BY CASTING HIS NETS ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT WAS NOT HIS PHYSICAL STRENGTH THAT PUT THE FISH IN THE BOAT. IT WAS HIM PUTTING HIMSELF IN OBEDIENCE IN POSITION FOR THE MIRACLE TO TAKE PLACE. &gt;&gt; When you put yourself in position, then you can watch barness break. I'd say it's it's time we start hearing some cries. And I I'm finished and the musicians can make their way. It's time that we hear some cries of some children. Too many times, too many times we set in a position of satisfaction. But let me say this to you. If you've ever been in a birthing room, there's a lot of noise in there. There's a lot of emotion there. There's a lot of heightened intensity moments there. And in that space, it's a place of birth. It's a place of it's a real holy place if we could say it like that. There's times there's tears of sorrow. And I believe that too many times that we've got parents that have cried the tears of sorrow because they've not seen their children manifest the life that they wanted them to. Don't you give up. Don't you give up. You keep holding on. But I want to say this to you. It's time that we have some tears of joy. It's time that we have some rejoicing in this church and in your life. I said this one time and it really stuck. Sometime in your life, you need a W. You need a win. You get to a spot where you really just need to have a a moment of victory. &gt;&gt; You ever been there? You need a season of victory. &gt;&gt; Can I prophesy to you? YOU'RE GETTING READY TO HAVE A season of victory, bride. [applause] &gt;&gt; You go through seasons OF REJECTION, OF SORROW AND FEAR. IT'S TIME TO GO THROUGH THE THE SEASON OF WEEPING. WHERE HAS OUR WEEPING HAS BEEN TURNED TO JOY AND OUR OUR SORROW AND OUR OUR BARRENNESS AND OUR ASHES BECOME BEAUTY? WHERE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE STRUGGLED THROUGH, FINALLY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REJOICE TO MANIFEST THE PRAISES OF GOD BACK UPON OUR LIPS AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SO, if we're going to bring forth, then there's got to be some crying. I I I always I enjoy it, but it scares me too sitting around mothers that talk about their birthing experiences. scares scares me to death what I'm going to hear and I then there's always competition that nobody had as bad birthing process as I had. I'm telling you I had to have 14 epidurals and that that needle my husband passed out. He was eating a Snickers and my husband just wasn't in the right mood. He said the wrong thing. He told me to breathe and I told him to shut up. But everybody's got their different birthing stories. But who cares as long as you have a birth? &gt;&gt; I don't care whether it happens here at FULL GOSPEL LIGHTHOUSE OR IF IT HAPPENS TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE AT WORK. I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THROUGH LABOR FOR 14 HOURS OR 22 HOURS. AS LONG AS YOU HAD SOME BIRTH, &gt;&gt; BUT IF THAT BABY'S STILL LOCKED up on the inside OF YOU, THEN YOU'VE got yourself an issue &gt;&gt; and you got to have a C-section. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THERE'S A DOCTOR HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO BRING FORTH CHILDREN. AND IT MAY NOT IT MAY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE NEVER COMING, THAT THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO COME FORTH. BUT I SAY THIS TO YOU, THERE'S A DOCTOR IN THIS ROOM THAT KNOWS HOW TO HEAL, THAT KNOWS HOW TO BREAK BARRENNESS, THAT knows [applause] the atmosphere. God bless you, brother Matthew. Let's stand. But I searched the world. [music] Oh, but [singing] it couldn't feel me. [music] Man's empty praise and treasures that they are never enough. [music] Oh, then you came along. [music] Oh man, put me back together. &gt;&gt; And every desire [music] is now [singing] satisfied hearing your [music] love. Oh, there's [music] nothing better than you, Lord.

You turn shame [music and singing] into glory. You're the only one who gave. [music] &gt;&gt; You turn [music] gra into gardenings. You turn bones into [singing] aries. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You turn seas into highways.

There's [music] nothing that's better than you, [music] there's nothing, &gt;&gt; nothing is better than you. Christ alone will [music] glory. I could pride myself in [music] that one. I've been blessed [music] beyond measure and lovely by your strength. I overcome. I could stop [music] and cast successes like diamonds [music] in [music] &gt;&gt; but those glories were not [singing] to the praise I reach [music and singing] and Christ Oh [music] my place, my [singing] trust and find [music and singing] my glory.

Though only by [music] his grace I [singing] am redeemed. And only [music] his mercies can reach beyond [music] my weakness to my [music] no just to [music] know you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Wait to count my kings [singing] but lo [music] [music] and [music] oh I place &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; I find my glory.
