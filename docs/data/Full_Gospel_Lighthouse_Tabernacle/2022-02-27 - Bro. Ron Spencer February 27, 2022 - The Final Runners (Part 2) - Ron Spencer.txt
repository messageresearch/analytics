event this afternoon and we've got some baptisms to go on today and then we're we're going to be having baptism next week as well a couple i think as that's the case and amen we're just in that season amen it's so good to see each and every one of you good to have the strikes with us from ohio and and i believe it's her mother and father amen amen god bless you i preached to you for years and so amen you guys are home people now so god bless you amen thank you for being here what a journey that they have made that's about a 10 hour journey to come to church and so amen you're thinking about your little half an hour deal they got 10 hours back home and that's just as real as 10 hours here and so amen so we just love you with all of our hearts and so good to see you and and we just know that god has some incredible things in store for us this week and amen things are going on and we're as a bride of jesus christ we're very much aware of where we're at this is not a time to fear this is a time to get ready amen and so i would i would like to just speak to you this morning on the final runners part two and uh we're just so thankful for what god is doing i want to make you aware of some things and some of your newcomers some of you have never heard these things before and uh for some of you you've been looking for this for decades and now we're here and so god bless you i seem to be a little in a barrel a little bit so if you can help me i would like for us first of all not just for an exercise but for a covenant with god i would like for us to read psalms 91 and that chapter all the way through and this is a covenant and i want you to read it as a covenant for you in this hour uh people that will be watching that are that are uh that are associated with us around the world it's not just us as a little body of believers but there's people that are in bomb shelters in ukraine uh we got a video of some of them singing and and uh what an event that was and then not only that uh just this morning brother barry coffey made us aware that that they're they're calling backwards and forwards praying with one another there they believe this message as much as we do they're looking for rapture as much as we are there are not just believers in the ukraine but there's there's incredible churches in russia as well and they're believers of this message with everything men that have literally even in the ukraine that that literally risked their lives to carry this message that you believe they risked their lives to carry the message to the believers there when it was called the iron curtain and so now they are they are established uh phenomenal churches there and um though they be in bomb shelters god's still with them and whether you know it or not you're just as much as in peril as they are amen so don't get relaxed because you're on the other side you remember many years ago the immoral living used to be in san francisco and it didn't bother you too bad until it got in your mcdonald's and then it invaded your schools and sodom is living almost next door to you but as long as it was 2 000 miles away it didn't seem to be so bad but sin is infiltrated you remember brother branham was saying i'm sorry to have you stand but i want to kind of set the tone brother branham was sitting with presidents that's that's who brother branham was he was that kind of a man he was sitting with presidents and richard nixon was there and and uh uh the the president was there that was talking about russia talking about the things and and they were they were worried about communism and fascism and is and those isms that were rising up and brother branham said uh it's not that that's out there is going to destroy america it's the worm on the inside sin is going to destroy america sin took america without a shot and that's where we're at that's where we're at amen now i would like for i will read the first verse you read the second and we'll just backwards and forwards like that for these scriptures he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and for the noise of pestilence thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flieth by day a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee because he thou hath made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways thou shalt tread upon the lion and the outer the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet he shall call upon me and i shall answer him i will be with him in trouble and i will deliver him and honor him i'd like to go to matthew chapter 25 and i want to do the very same thing down through verse 13. amen matthew 25 and verse 1. then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them and while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go you rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves after came also the other virgin saying lord lord open to us watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour when the son of man cometh you may be seated amen god bless you laodicean church age book the fir the third vision was in the realm of the world of politics for it showed me that there would would be three great isms fascism nazism and communism fascism is is is a form of of socialism and that actually rules america today but that the first two would be swallowed up in the third the voice admonished admonished watch russia watch russia i want you to remember when brother branham was saying these words at the time that he was saying him it was a soviet union but god knows exactly the hour and the timing and the situation and so when the prophet is standing there and he's screaming watch russia watch russia he was more than just another preacher on the earth now we realize that god is in the same the same book god is governing in the affairs of men right now he is both creator and sustainer colossians chapter 1 and verse 16 he says for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist a brother sent me this this week and he says the devil is a prime dummy amen he is of all all beings ought to know that god's word cannot fail then he chose to spend his existence picking a fight with an undefeatable god and at the end of it all he will not even get a participation ribbon that's good enough to go ahead and applaud you can do that we're standing in the very brink and we've been speaking over the last few weeks and the first of all we spoke on entrance and it was a night to where it was a sunday right after following uh brother andrew glover that has broken entrance the night before and i was i was speaking to you that in revelations chapter 3 that jesus stands at the door knocking on this age and this would be the age of the church that would put him outside the door they would put him out and jesus is wanting to get back in and he brother branham explains to us that it's like a of the great artist that that was there and he he made a picture of jesus standing outside of the door knocking and the critic says but there's no handle on the on the you missed the the you missed a part of the door there's no handle there that jesus can go through and he said you missed the theme of the picture [Music] jesus is waiting on you to open the door and we realize that we're either veiling god or we're veiling the devil even the either the king of our heart is jesus christ or the the king of our heart is the enemy satan himself are you with me and so we realized that that we as individuals jesus will talk about it like this and he would say that a man has a strong house and and he said accept a stronger come and come into the house then the stronger comes in and binds it and then and then he sweeps and he garnishes and i'm just paraphrasing here but an unless you get god on the inside of your heart the devil will come back in and people can take on spirits and they take on church spirits they take on personalities of people they take on personalities of hollywood and brother branham warned us he said don't come to take the church spirit or even the pasture spirit we come to get the spirit of christ now how important is this when we talked about being on the entrance and there were some key things that i said right there there's a few things there's a few places in the scriptures were that people seemed absolutely innocent for an incredible length of time in their life and then satan entered them you remember these statements satan entered them and they became a complete different individual you remember you remember i mentioned to you that hitler he was a man that was on the rise of politics brother and in 1933 picks him out as the man that will lead the world to war now remember germany was a christian nation at that time she had become a christian nation she'd let a world a war in the world and and and they came to back down and everything was settled but there's a spirit that was rising and the that third reich was rising prophet of god was standing here in america and seeing that vision of that man rising and it may seem politically correct for a long time but there came a time where he took on another spirit and he would lead the world to a war a christian nation would get under the spirit of that it doesn't take but one percent of a nation to lead a world to a war we remember there was a man that was in the scriptures and he was a disciple no one would have thought that he would be filled with the devil as a matter of fact even john the very beloved when he is sitting at the lord's supper and jesus begins to talk about a man's that's going to betray him and he says even john would say he said ah yes it does now let's just think about this just for a minute we're talking about final runners for the last weekend and this weekend we're at the juncture of everything of the prophecy that has taken place but go back 2 000 years ago when redemption was right on the brink of being paid for and the devil was sitting right in the church the very man that would sell out the greatest preacher the very lamb of god why who would ever turn against a man that could take a withered hand and make it whole or raise a friend from the dead or go to the widow of nan's funeral and raise him back to life or go to legion and restore that man to his right mind and to have a family and to preach peace and safety and preach real truth and binded the denominational spirits of that day and telling them that they were of their father the devil who could ever turn against this jesus but the scripture says that satan entered into judas's heart but i want you to just notice humanity they can't live with the blood of jesus christ on their hands we've come to an age that is an insane age they rejected the message and tried to wash the blood of jesus off of their hands but you can't wash it off your hands pilate tried to wash it they tried to wash it off of his hands i find no fault in this man but suicide would be in his life because he couldn't live with the guilt judas couldn't live with himself he wanted to destroy his own body he couldn't go to pentecost he had preached in his name he had healed in his name but it also sold jesus for pieces of silver that you couldn't even go buy property with i want to just share something with you i was sitting on an airplane many years ago i i didn't have the bible that i have with me today or but i was carrying a bible with me and i was i was on my way to canada and i was actually headed to calgary and i had my bible with me and it was a i think if i can remember correct it was from from washington at that point to to calgary and uh i had been i've been studying for the convention that i was getting ready to speak and it was a man that was sitting next to me and you could just tell he was a kind of a very humble man and he was very he was he was just interested he looks over at me and he says they tell me that russia is in that book and i said it is it is in this book this book's written 2 000 years ago but russia's in this book he said as america in this book and i said yes sir so i took the time to show him in revelation chapter 13. that america was in the book but i want to remind you as an end time player we're not that amazing we're we're not an end time player we're finding ourselves in the news almost helpless i'll tell you why let me just let me just background it just for a moment hollywood and all of the perversion and the turning down of the message our moral conduct is in the pit we are reaping the seeds that we have sowed and and here we are where we are and this man began to talk to me a bit and he wanted to know about the plan of redemption and his wife got extremely upset with him have nothing to do with that man have nothing and he kept hearing her have nothing to do with him and i just was showing him in the scriptures because i knew not to bring brother branham into the picture because he wanted to see it in god's word and so i just took him through the scriptures just displacing him were things and where we are that man i i i turned to him and now it's my turn to ask a question and i said if you don't mind me asking i'd like to ask you why are you wanting to know these answers and he said i am mr putin's translator this was in the beginnings of of his run as a leader of russia and it seemed like then it seemed like then i was in a moment to where that i'd been placed in a certain spot i'm going to preach to you today and so i i'm just gonna give you my heart and his wife is telling him have nothing to do with him have nothing to do with him and i said where do you see putin and america at he said putin is is america's greatest enemy now let me just say this to you this morning's this morning's headlines is as just as real as a 42-inch caribou this morning's headlines is just as real as a silver tip grizzly bear are three squirrels coming into existence or congressman upshaw coming out of a wheelchair or those brothers asking brother branham to go down to kentucky where would you go to find all he said it's there but he said they messed around and let somebody else get in front of them and they got just the edges of it are you with me now this morning's headlines is putin raises the alert level to nuclear status to special combat readiness if i could have all the prophets of the ages to come and give testimony they would say we've been waiting on this we've been waiting on this if we could have brother homer to come and greet this audience and he said this is what we have been waiting on this is where we're at you see god raises a man up to fulfill the word of god and gives him nuclear capability not just for america but remember russia is ordained in the scriptures and brother bran would use the term that russia is going to drop a nuclear bomb down to rome's smokestack remember that because god's going to destroy rome he's going to destroy that system i've got good catholic friends and they're good friends but it's a system that is corrupt it's like the denominational systems it's the systems that are corrupt but god sent this nation and the world a prophet and the corrupt men stood there and blinded the eyes of the people and told them don't look that way and vision after vision and prophecy after prophecy has come to fulfillment and just like in the days of noah they tried to explain the supernatural away in the days of moses they stood there when there was flies and frogs and and fleas and and the water turned to blood they tried to explain it away so the nominal men stood in this age and tried to explain it away i'd like for you over the next week or two to go back and listen to world falling apart we had a prophet stand and tell us and read to us tomorrow's newspaper now i'm going to say some pretty difficult things here for you to swallow but you just hang on we're going to make a public a public notice i as one of the representatives of this message since i was a little boy i stood at the the casket of the prophet of the lord four years old taught all my life that god sent a prophet but it never became real to me until i met the god not the man but i met the god of this message jesus christ that wanted to live inside of me now that same jesus wants to live inside of you so i want to make an announcement today that there's a there's kingdoms struggling all over the world and it's been prophesied and these things are going to happen russia's going to fulfill her plan and america is going to fulfill her plan and rome is going to fulfill his plan he's already declared himself as the leader of the world and one of the one of the top things that he did in this the last few months was climate change it's a lie god's going to burn the whole thing off it's going to be a climate change you know some of theirs is right it's going to be a climate change but these leaders rise no man can rise without god allowing it to happen we we wonder where these kind of individuals come from and then all of a sudden i i've read it and i've read i've read dozens of articles on it over the last couple of days that how that even putin has had a nature change he's had a behavioral issue over the last couple of months things have turned well i can tell you i can tell you god's been speaking to the bride there's an entrance it's happening and there's a there's a spirit that has overtaken him that to fulfill the plan of the hour you can't do that on your home human self but a spirit of hell an anointed from hell to destruct and do the destruction that he's going to do and i'm saying that going to do [Applause] but i wanted them all to know just brother george quinn told me just this week that russia flew five different nuclear aircraft over top of the golden heights in israel so there's a lot of the fronts that are going on our america media don't tell us a lot of stuff but you see god's got a lot of things that's happening boom boom boom boom boom boom boom but i want to make in this announcement that there is a king of kings that's coming [Music] he is the prince of peace friends that are in poland and and czechoslovakia and ukraine and in russia pastors that are there that we have known through the years i want you to understand this and i'm sorry we can't save you in a lot of instances you know we don't have an answer forgive us nato is not the answer they're not even ready they confess they're not ready they've raised up plans this week but they're not ready but i want to tell you who is there's angels that are in in foxholes there's angels that are in subway stations there's angels that are standing in this building today that are standing on readiness [Applause] whether you realize or not as much as these men are being infiltrated with the powers of darkness the bride of jesus christ has already been infiltrated and filled with the power of the holy ghost this holy ghost will lead us and guide us and direct us it'll be with us it'll watch over center protect us it'll protect us in wars it'll protect us in bombs dropping it'll protect us in place coming our way it'll be our protector you say well brother ron i don't know about all of that how can he protect us in these situations we look at our past he watched over us in world war one he watched over us in world war ii he watched over us in skirmishes he watched over this part of the world in their civil war our farms were destroyed our plan our our our beautiful places were become mud huts because of the wars that were taking place and god had some of our grandfathers fighting on the battle and whether they were believers or not for that day angels were standing watching over their natural sea knowing you were on the way so don't never tell me that god's never done nothing for you i had three grandfathers fight on the same battlefield in the civil war one was a colonel one was a foot soldier and one was a sergeant standing all in a five-acre field two two armies coming together think of the odds of hundreds of men dying and three of my grandfathers were standing there they were protected because god had already pre-planned i'm going to preach god had already plea planned me and my family to come on the earth that we would be the final runners of this day our church is now as the message brother tim pruitt is celebrating his 50th anniversary this weekend we will celebrate ours in a couple of years brother bischel's church will be celebrating 50 years in a couple of months 50 means jubilee we've heard the message we followed the message we fed the word and we have arrived if you'll remember abraham was in the brink of something and had a meeting with god himself that god himself sat before him in this tent's door they ate meat they drank milk they had a conversation the eternal god was looking at abraham as the beginning the foundation father of the message and abraham couldn't see he wanted to have a son and he had one by ishmael but the promise was by sarah and sarah couldn't see herself in the promise because remember she's now well past age to produce a child and now it's impossible for abraham to produce a child but now he's sitting with the one that made the promise follow me just a moment he's it with the one that's written the lamb's book and it's got all the names in it and remember in romans it it when paul begins to mark out that abraham staggered not at the promises of god but in the old testament abraham laughs and rolls on the ground but through the blood of jesus christ god doesn't see your failures and sometimes it's very difficult for us to see the big picture when we're so concerned with the little picture they had had an argument just before melchizedek comes brother bennett picks it up is there anything too hard for the lord he goes right back and describes how satan tries to block the visitation of that day how much more does satan try to block the visitation of our services and maybe it's not an argument but there's a situation that's in your home and a situation in your relationship and there's just a little bit a little bite that goes on it's only the devil because he knows he can't destroy the word and he can't destroy the seed so he's working on your human flesh the only spot that he can why did sarah laugh i didn't laugh i ain't laughing and god would have killed her except for she was in the book there's a lot of things that we've done in our life where we doubted because really that's what she did she doubted she literally couldn't see herself and there's sometimes you come to church and go well you know this is a nice service go home get in a different change of clothes different style of music you go right back into your routine but when will you realize that i should have been ready they kept telling me to get ready they kept telling me to get ready but my human nature like sitting in sarah's tent i just couldn't believe i was part of the promise i'm just getting older these guys have been preaching this for generations and and decades and you know we're just going on we had to wait till putin grew up jesus was standing here with his inner circle of believers and he says be there for ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh then he begins to describe something that was as a little boy was difficult for me to get two in the field want to be taken want to be left two at the mill want to be taken and want to be left and he begins to describe these things and he's telling us to be ready when brother branham approaches that scripture and he approaches that thought he begins to talk about how that martin went into the tomb and luther went into the tomb and if god would have the angel would have told paul it's going to be 2 000 years he said if he had told them it's going to be all that time later there would have been no readiness and he said every one of them went into the ground and they died in the faith they didn't die in sin they died in the faith looking for the coming of the lord it wasn't that they wasn't christian so death took them are you with me it wasn't that brother branham wasn't what wasn't wasn't ready for the rapture it was his time was over with and he preaches communion he preaches leadership he preaches his sermons preparing getting ready to go he had seen his end at 56 a long time ago but the message had to be sent out [Applause] and a lot of people sorted through it got what they wanted walked away from it but there was a group of people that were ordained [Applause] that was you that's a jew brother the menace that's exactly right that was you what made the difference between you caught it and your family didn't why are you here why are you here i think about this family right here that's here they came in during covet and here they are you came from a denominal church and i'm not going to point that out but that pastor called called andrew and he was in he was in japan and he was trying to convince andrew that this wasn't right he spent about an hour and then all of a sudden he began to get convinced himself that what andrew was preaching to you was right mary davis how did you get here what kept you here joel what are you doing here how did you get here he was telling me some of his story and he said i was i was trying to get off the grid he said i was trying to live live to where there was no no electricity no no no whirly he said i was just trying to get away didn't know nothing about the message someone hands him a book hallelujah you look back and go well well my family was raised in this church don't take that for granted don't take that for granted don't just let that stumble through well i'm occupying a few because my family was raised in this church don't be a part of the missing don't be a part of the fulfillment of when we're all gone that you knock on the door and go where's brother run at well brother on los angeles hasn't dropped i'll be honest with you i don't want to be here when los angeles drops [Applause] well haven't you read the prophecy and haven't you read all of those things and haven't you read about may's store have you looked up may's store lately they're a shark exhibit they've got sharks as exhibits in may store so sometimes visions is not exactly how you think they're going to be so don't think that you get this thing figured out and well we're going to just be here in 2074 we have arrived i remember asking my brother that is now the pastor at the church when i walked up to him and i asked him it was on a saturday afternoon and he was a bowling champion and he was getting ready to go pro and he was and he had an average of over 225 and for those bowlers that know anything about that i got an average of about 80 probably you know he thought he had the whirl by the tail your father and i looked at him and i said so what excuse do you have and i'm standing with him i'm his brother sometimes brothers can look eye to eye with one another and i said what excuse do you have for not serving god we've had a message to get us ready now what excuse do you have to not be ready you remember jesus comes into the room and there's a man there that doesn't have the wedding garment on and he doesn't go somebody bring this man a garment somebody somebody get a garment real quick get a garment uh get a garment for this man he said cast him out the garment is the the word of the hour the holy ghost it's your seal that god has placed ownership on you before god gives you the holy ghost he cleanses you you're baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then god fills you with the holy ghost now listen being god he knows what your god is a king of your heart and he's not going to seal a pornographed spirit he's not going to seal lust demons and rock and roll demons and churches and demons he's going to wash you and purge you and clean you and get you ready for service then you've got a purpose to serve god the rest of your life [Applause] denny vance this is much better greater to be a deacon in a church than be a professional wrestler what held him the holy ghost held him what holds us through trials and situations i think we're getting numb sometime i think we get to the place to where we get numb if we're not careful i'm going to address some things so you just hang right with me we allow church to become common there's a revival that's going on amongst us here the angel lord is with us he's with us he's proved himself to be with us and i'm not just saying that just to be saying that we've seen him we've seen the pillar of fire we're living in the season of of the revival is happening the last ones are coming in getting ready because there's a home going that's coming my brother began to stand there and talk to me about what was holding him back the guy that he bowled with had a massive heart attack that next week and died in his arms mark played another week or two and he was accused of sandbagging and a man pulled a gun on him and threatened his life mark was traveling doing work and it was in a parking lot in the middle of the night that the lord met him and he gave his heart to the lord and he never turned back from that moment brother meadows many years ago was walking and i hope this is all right he was at a point of his life of wanting to commit suicide isn't that right we look at him as the strongest man we've ever known in natural flesh for those that didn't know that ernest take it from me he's the strongest physical human being i've ever known in human flesh we we dug a whale down here and i watched four men try to pick this bit up and they couldn't pick it up and i i joined with them and another man joined with them and they we got the bid up on the trailer and so when that company backed up here and that bit needed to come off of that trailer and be stood up brother meadows just rich and got it and pulled it up and stood it right there but they're coming in to that kind of strength there comes an end to that kind of strength but there's another strength that he possesses [Applause] and that's the readiness his wife slipped life could not be sustained in her body so she slipped into the message that we have preached all these years and she stepped into a well body she wouldn't want to come back she's experienced what this message has taught for years it's the truth it's absolutely the truth you can look across this audience at his family they're sitting here i want to tell children grandchildren great-grandchildren don't take these services for granted don't take it for granted noah no i could just stand in your chair it'd be the only time i'm going to ever ask you to do that would you stand on your chair noah's got a name to him noah is a product of that man believing the message where's his grandma out i can't find her i'm looking my eyes are my eyes are not good could you stand you became acquainted many years ago with the god of this message and you went through a very difficult time when your husband slipped beyond the veil and he was a pillar and every time i have a vision of homer or a dream of homer your husband's standing there now it's not a season to get jealous because in that realm it's all taken care of thank you roger for being a phenomenal husband well let me just say this to you he slipped beyond and i re i was standing there the night that billy andrews said i'm telling you i'm telling you tonight that this man is filled with with a black sheet on him and if god don't touch him he's going to be gone in six weeks six weeks to the day he was gone death didn't conquer him this message that he loved with everything in him carried him to a new body and every time i have a vision of of homer or a dream of homer he's standing in there what around i don't know what time i started maybe you're new to the message and i don't know who's here who's not here and you forgive me my eyes are just out of balance and i'm doing the best i can so but brother branham was standing in a cave in 1946 there's a room he calls it a room he calls it a few different things a cave as a man steps in the room a man from another realm and he steps in that room and he begins to tell him of what his ministry has been and what it's going to be that angel that steps into the room is standing there having a conversation with a man that is like sarah i can't do it no doubt it was the same angelic presence that was with moses when moses is going to be a one-man invasion but they had a conversation about me nathaniel me and you've been in rooms to where they were discovering cancer it's really good to have you with me we've been in some dark spots together where they would tell me that i've got stage four then we have a cancer in my brain cancer in my lungs but here's really important to me they would stand there and talk about cancer the disease that many struggle with that are listening right now sister ruth wilson just found out she has cancer and brother tim pruitt's she's trying to muster the faith others have written me there's a sister in in canada that is at the door of death and i and she's no doubt listening i want you to understand that that angel was standing with the prophet and he spoke not even cancer [Applause] not even cancer the most difficult demon in the world not even cancer will stand before it [Applause] not even cancer will stand before it it's okay satan's trying to get me to stop but he ain't getting me [Applause] brother i'd like to just drop this to you that was a very important meeting say well i don't know where i believe that or not i'm not here even to negotiate that with you it happened it happened and for the next decades the prophet would stand there and it was not a gift but the one that matth that andrew preached about last night the mighty angel stood there and night after night 8 300 visions 83 80 to be exact 8300 visions took place in brother branham's ministry and it was exactly right and that's just what's on tape brother shannon i find this absolutely amazing war has not been in europe since before the angel stood in a cave with a prophet and i've been thinking about this over the last couple of weeks what has held it back what has held it back all of this so i come to the conclusion you have you were the important one now now let me just say this to you readiness means a lot to a lot of different people i have a friend of mine that's a general in the military that is in in charge of the buttons how i became a friend of his was being a a chimney sweep in his home many times he actually paid me in gold i've got it somewhere because he said it's coming it's not an if he'd never heard the prophet my dad stood and i i put a a a class a chimney in his house cut the holes did all the alignment put everything together and dad stood for over five hours and told that general about the god sending a messenger to this day and he stood spellbound because he's one of the original preppers and he had dug a bomb shelter and he had canned food and he was ready he said it's not if it's going to happen it's going to happen no message to get him ready he never heard it it didn't come by his way but it did yours those that are listening by the internet intently it came your way you talk about grace you're talking about grace that man lives on a hair trigger he knows readiness in 1986 i set in a service and it was a preacher that stood in the pulpit and preached a sermon out of hebrews chapter 12 and i'll be done in just a few more minutes i'm getting a little bit weak but i want to just share this with you i said and i listened and he spoke about others have run and he talked about smith wigglesworth and he talked about f.f bosworth and he talked about peter cartwright and he talked about john wesley do you know that john wesley was was stoned over and over and over again and he kept getting up and preaching the next day they beat him and they beat him with whips trying to get him to quit preaching and that five-foot-one red-headed preacher had something on the inside of him [Applause] that was bigger than all their whips and all of their rocks and being thrown out of churches don't tell me your excuses some friend don't tell me your excuses some debt denomination where ichabod has been written on the door and the spirit of god is not even going to go back to it don't tell me it's your job do you know that there are millionaires in bomb shelters in ukraine and they don't have a drop of money because their money evaporated in the banks it's gone it's just literally gone aren't you glad that's in ukraine aren't you glad it's in ukraine people get all so excited about their million dollars in their bank and a cyber warfare happens and everything that they've worked for and everything they built for is gone and and somebody has to tell them that it's gone it's gone it's gone some of you get upset with me over your ira account you better not count on it you better not count on it i stood in a house that was 48 000 square feet thousand square feet it's a residential home owned by a lady and her husband a friend of mine jason jackson actually wired that house as an electrician and i walked out on the front of it and it had a bow range it had about 10 to 15 bedrooms in it bathrooms everywhere a safe room and it had everything you can imagine it had a nanny room it had a it had a mother-in-law suite it was it was it was unbelievable and i walked out and there's a it's a cliff there and i walked out and i i looked down that cliff at the river the river is running below it and i looked across the hill and that's where there's where a tornado came across and destroyed every business mode that entire place just mowed it down and it was gone kentucky fried was gone it's probably the greatest problem kentucky fried was washed away it just the business was there and was gone it was there and it was gone and i said jason one storm one one one afternoon bright sunny day storm with a funny tail on the end of it can wipe away this 48 thousand square feet house one afternoon he's just gone this is gone i'd say that kind of take you take your breath a little bit however on your youtube especially kids watches those fails now i know who is there's a there was a little deal popped up the other day mega money car fails guy had paid 500 000 and he drove it out of the parking lot and he went less than a mile and he destroyed that car literally literally i couldn't help i couldn't help but feel sorry for him and laugh at the same time come on he just got in it he just thought it was great and it was good he was gone when i was a little boy me and your daddy we lived in a trailer it was 14 by 70. we lived in a trailer we had the back rooms and we were so on alert for the rapture until when we would wake up in the night i'd go shake him and i always called him a monkey in bed because he was always all over the bed mark i'm sorry and we would go and we go i can't hear mom and dad as the rapture happened and they're gone it's a real real thing to children it's a real thing to children and i'm saying this for a reason and we would slip up and we would slip up and there was a bathroom there was a little hall and then there was a king-sized bed where my mom and dad snored in they'll understand if they hear this and when you would get so close you didn't need to go another step forward to know that they were there everything's fine they were there it was a rumble and my mom would go you know what i'm talking about david you know i know yeah we're old enough you know what i'm talking about but that was the most comforting sound brother donnie to hear her because she was there are you with me because we were so believing it was just any minute now i don't want to instill fear in you now but i want to tell you this can be our greatest hour it's not just for you it's for your children now let me just back here just a minute when the death age was coming when moses was healed god instructed them to put a token over the door blood from a spotless lamb and they would paint the door lentil they would paint with that blood and then they would eat the book or eat the lamb and eat it all and if it wasn't if you couldn't eat it all you got other people in with you and you hate it i won't believe it just a few more minutes let me just say this to you as those children and that death angels is coming and you can hear it coming and you can hear the screams of egypt how many times have we preached it daddy are you sure are you sure you got that blood applied to the door are you sure especially if you're that oldest boy if you're that oldest boy you know if your daddy don't have it right that ain't that death angel is no respecter of persons if you don't have it right [Music] come on moms and dads come on we're more than a promise keeper convention we're the bride of jesus christ i want to make sure that everything's right i want to be ready i want to be on a hair trigger i want to know that i know that i know that i know that i know [Applause] i'm an oldest boy and i can imagine after it's passed by and i'm still alive how thankful to god how

stand but roy shrewsbury looked at ronnie reagan ronnie lilly and he said brother roy i'm saved now you think it'll be all right for me to go back out in the world and do this just maybe one more time i thought it was incredible wisdom that he gave him he said ronnie when the rapture happens i don't want to be found doing nothing wrong amen don't take jesus nowhere you wouldn't want to take him
