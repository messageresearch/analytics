[58:10] about down from his glory and each day
[58:14] as it went and then the Sunday service
[58:17] as it was and

[58:22] Andrew if you if you don't stop I'm not
[58:25] going to have anything to preach

[58:31] just are so appreciative of that amen
[58:34] amen God bless you God bless you if you
[58:38] will turn with me in your scriptures to
[58:39] Psalms chapter 51.
[58:42] and verse 1.
[58:45] Psalms 51 and verse 1. today I'd like to
[58:48] speak on
[58:50] sweeping it under the Ruck
[58:55] we need a blood
[58:58] we need a blood that'll cleanse Our
[59:00] Lives
[59:02] amen amen
[59:05] Psalms chapter 51 and verse 1.
[59:11] this is incredible words
[59:13] have mercy upon me
[59:16] o God
[59:18] according to thy loving kindness
[59:21] according to the multitude of thy Tender
[59:24] Mercies
[59:25] blot out my transgressions
[59:29] Wash Me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[59:32] cleanse me from my sin
[59:34] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[59:37] my sin as ever before me against thee
[59:40] and thee only have I sinned and done
[59:43] this evil in thy sight
[59:45] that thou mightest be justified in when
[59:47] thou speakest and be clear when thou
[59:50] judgest
[59:51] behold I was shaping an iniquity and sin
[59:54] did my mother conceived me
[59:56] behold thou desires the inward parts and
[59:59] in the hidden part Thou shalt make me to
[1:00:02] no wisdom
[1:00:03] Purge me with hyssip and I shall be
[1:00:06] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[1:00:09] snow
[1:00:10] make me to hear the joy and gladness
[1:00:13] that the bones which thou has broken May
[1:00:16] Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and
[1:00:20] blot out all my iniquities
[1:00:23] creating me a clean heart o God and
[1:00:27] renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:00:29] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:00:32] take not by Holy Spirit from me
[1:00:35] restore unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:00:39] and uphold me with a free spirit
[1:00:43] amen isn't that what you want today
[1:00:46] now invite him by your Pew let's pray
[1:00:49] Lord Jesus we stand as a needy people
[1:00:52] today
[1:00:53] we have needs Lord the speaker has needs
[1:00:56] no doubt all through this audience
[1:00:58] there's many needs
[1:01:00] father you're a God that can supply them
[1:01:03] all
[1:01:04] you've never seen a disease that
[1:01:06] defeated you never seen a sin that you
[1:01:09] couldn't take care of Lord I just asked
[1:01:12] you today that you would just come and
[1:01:14] wash us you have a blood that can purges
[1:01:17] clean as snow Lord we invite your holy
[1:01:21] presence among us today and I pray that
[1:01:24] you would strengthen us in a mighty way
[1:01:26] we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[1:01:29] amen and amen you can be seated
[1:01:33] in Luke chapter 22 and verse 31 Jesus is
[1:01:37] having a very
[1:01:39] powerful conversation with Simon
[1:01:43] we would know him as Peter
[1:01:46] Simon
[1:01:47] Simon
[1:01:50] behold Satan hath desired to have you
[1:01:54] that he might sift you
[1:01:57] as wheat
[1:01:58] Simon wasn't the only one that Satan has
[1:02:01] a desire to sift
[1:02:05] I love these next words
[1:02:07] but I have prayed for thee
[1:02:10] but I have prayed for thee that thy
[1:02:13] faith failed not and when thou art
[1:02:16] converted
[1:02:18] strengthen
[1:02:20] thy brethren
[1:02:23] our age that we live in we recognize
[1:02:25] that it's a wicked age
[1:02:28] the characteristics of this age would be
[1:02:30] borne out in Revelations chapter 3.
[1:02:35] and as John would write it I Know Thy
[1:02:38] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[1:02:41] I would that thou were cold or hot so
[1:02:43] then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:02:45] neither cold nor hot I will spew thee
[1:02:47] out of my mouth
[1:02:49] because thou sayest I am enriched and
[1:02:52] increased with goods and and have need
[1:02:54] of nothing and know us not that thou are
[1:02:57] wretched and miserable and poor and
[1:03:01] blind and naked
[1:03:04] I counseled thee tobiah make gold tried
[1:03:06] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:03:09] and white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:03:11] clothed in the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:03:13] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:03:16] thy saith that thou mayest see
[1:03:19] as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and
[1:03:22] be zealous therefore and repent I love
[1:03:26] these words Behold I stand at the door
[1:03:28] and knock
[1:03:29] all the other Church ages Jesus was
[1:03:32] working among them but in our church age
[1:03:34] Jesus is on the outside of the door
[1:03:37] trying to get in
[1:03:39] behold I stand at the door and knocking
[1:03:42] If any man hear my voice and open the
[1:03:44] door I will come into him and will sup
[1:03:46] with him and he with me
[1:03:50] since the fall of man's sin has reigned
[1:03:55] and it not only reigned in humanity but
[1:03:58] it reigned in the earth to where the
[1:04:00] Earth became cursed
[1:04:02] animals know the fall animals are under
[1:04:07] the persecution a young doe the other
[1:04:10] day was dropped to a young baby right at
[1:04:13] the end of my driveway and I've walked
[1:04:15] past her a few times over the last last
[1:04:18] few days and that baby's laying there
[1:04:21] and it's completely head and once in a
[1:04:23] while it'll stand up and it's it's got
[1:04:25] those white spots don't get that Bambi
[1:04:27] idea right quick now
[1:04:30] yeah
[1:04:31] but anyway immediately when that baby is
[1:04:34] born
[1:04:35] it's born with no sin on its body
[1:04:37] there's a reason for that because
[1:04:40] predators are already looking for that
[1:04:43] baby
[1:04:45] seems like almost unfair
[1:04:47] that anything that beautiful and being
[1:04:50] born like that is immediately got a
[1:04:53] predator after it
[1:04:55] it just whether it's a bear we've got
[1:04:58] about a 400 pound Bearer running through
[1:05:00] our property and he's beautiful one of
[1:05:03] the biggest mayors that we've had for
[1:05:04] quite a long time there they get in my
[1:05:07] trash they they get in my dumpster
[1:05:11] they get on my car
[1:05:14] last night had your dogs barking and I
[1:05:18] went out and you know they're just
[1:05:20] they're just there but that Barrel if he
[1:05:23] could get to that little deer he would
[1:05:25] eat it he would he would destroy it and
[1:05:27] they eat so many a year but it wasn't
[1:05:31] like that in the Garden of Eden
[1:05:34] everything ate grass everything ate
[1:05:37] fruits and everything was eating from
[1:05:40] the natural
[1:05:41] but immediately when man fell
[1:05:46] when man fell
[1:05:48] when the amateur God fell off
[1:05:51] sin began to reign
[1:05:54] amen now it don't mean that Satan owns
[1:05:56] it but he tries to possess it
[1:05:59] you see Satan he really can't get to
[1:06:01] your soul when you're born again and
[1:06:04] you're filled with the spirit of God but
[1:06:06] he will attack your spirit then he'll
[1:06:08] attack your flesh
[1:06:11] he would like to destroy you if he could
[1:06:13] but thank God for the angels of God the
[1:06:16] word of that is our protector God that
[1:06:19] is watching over us
[1:06:23] kind of reminds me of a
[1:06:25] little boy
[1:06:29] I think this is interesting I heard this
[1:06:32] from Brother Dan daisley
[1:06:35] and a little boy was
[1:06:38] playing in a mud puddle
[1:06:41] you know he so enjoyed playing in that
[1:06:44] mud apuddle but after a while he was
[1:06:46] drenched he was muddy he was a horrible
[1:06:48] condition he would come in and his mom
[1:06:51] would clean him all up and
[1:06:54] and she would send him out and said
[1:06:55] don't get in that again and for long
[1:06:58] about an hour later here he come again
[1:07:01] just as muddy just as dirty just as wet
[1:07:04] this time she gave him and she cleaned
[1:07:07] him up and she washed him and this time
[1:07:09] she gave him a sermon
[1:07:12] she said now Johnny
[1:07:14] you cannot get in that mud puddle again
[1:07:17] and she began to give him warnings you
[1:07:21] know you as parents sometimes almost
[1:07:29] you'll know Hunter you'll know
[1:07:33] you'll give him a sermon just before you
[1:07:35] walk into a restaurant or before you go
[1:07:37] into church
[1:07:39] you'll give them bribes you'll give them
[1:07:41] all different kind of things
[1:07:43] you'll promise to take their life if
[1:07:48] because you heard it from your mom and
[1:07:50] dad
[1:07:52] and so you know he left and he went out
[1:07:54] and she was watching that was a better
[1:07:57] good amen
[1:08:00] and she watched him through the kitchen
[1:08:01] window and she watched him as he went
[1:08:03] out through the yard and he was getting
[1:08:05] near that mud puddle and you know he
[1:08:07] made circles for a while
[1:08:09] took his shoes off and you know after a
[1:08:12] little while they put his toe in it
[1:08:15] you know he's kicking in the air and
[1:08:17] before long all of a sudden you know he
[1:08:20] was in
[1:08:24] here he came
[1:08:26] and you know what this time when he came
[1:08:28] he
[1:08:29] she began to repeat the sermon why did
[1:08:32] you do it
[1:08:33] why did you do it
[1:08:35] and here's here's a I I'm not just
[1:08:38] telling this story for no reason at all
[1:08:41] he said the devil made me do it
[1:08:47] she said Johnny
[1:08:50] you we are told as Christians to get
[1:08:54] behind me Satan
[1:08:56] he said I did
[1:08:58] and he pushed me in
[1:09:07] they wonder how much that we really put
[1:09:09] on the devil when he really wasn't it
[1:09:11] around it was just our human nature that
[1:09:13] did it
[1:09:18] something sometimes we're kind of
[1:09:22] judgmental of one another I know you're
[1:09:24] not but
[1:09:26] but it's kind of like a difference
[1:09:28] between the hog and a sheep
[1:09:32] now you know as ministers we're trying
[1:09:34] to get sheep
[1:09:36] so in our profession here
[1:09:39] we have a desire that you know everybody
[1:09:42] can be saved because it's a scripture
[1:09:45] God don't send nobody to hell
[1:09:48] your choices do that for you
[1:09:51] but it's like obesity the Hulk
[1:09:54] it came time for the fair
[1:09:56] you know the owner went and it cleaned
[1:09:59] it up and he washed it and you know and
[1:10:02] you know as he washes the hog and he
[1:10:05] washes that pig all that he can wash it
[1:10:08] he cleans it it takes a lot of Dawn
[1:10:11] dishwashing detergent to get every
[1:10:13] little thing out of the crevice and you
[1:10:16] know but you know then he puts a ribbon
[1:10:19] on it
[1:10:22] and he tries its best to put it in an
[1:10:25] environment to where it you know between
[1:10:27] now and the judging
[1:10:29] between now and the judging uh you know
[1:10:33] we've got to have her clean
[1:10:35] and you know Bessie she's you know she's
[1:10:38] really nice she eats the corn she eats
[1:10:41] the you know the whatever that they give
[1:10:43] him and you know she's really nice she
[1:10:45] enjoys the clean environment but it
[1:10:48] didn't change her nature
[1:10:51] you can keep her up for a week you can
[1:10:53] keep her up for two weeks and you can
[1:10:56] wash it and wash it and calm it and comb
[1:10:59] it and brush it and hug it and you know
[1:11:02] whenever Bessie's all clean
[1:11:05] you can put perfume on her and she'll
[1:11:07] smell good you might even tend because
[1:11:10] she's been so nice you might even tend
[1:11:13] to kiss her on the cheek a little bit
[1:11:15] but she's still a hog
[1:11:18] sometimes you forget she's still a hawk
[1:11:21] but you take her home and you open the
[1:11:24] trailer and she goes back into her
[1:11:27] normal environment you know what she
[1:11:29] does
[1:11:30] she don't stay in the cleanest place
[1:11:35] she goes right back to what's home for
[1:11:39] and she's all joyful and she's having a
[1:11:42] Revival right back in that Hulk no
[1:11:45] matter how much work that you've done
[1:11:50] and you're thinking all that work that I
[1:11:53] did to clean her up and keep her clean
[1:12:02] now I have to be really honest with you
[1:12:05] I spent a lot of time in my life
[1:12:07] cleaning Hawks
[1:12:12] you see I as a man human being
[1:12:16] I don't have the option to know whose
[1:12:19] Hogs and who's not
[1:12:26] so you know Here to Eternity I'm going
[1:12:29] to still clean some Hawks
[1:12:31] and I'm gonna wash him and I'm gonna
[1:12:34] clean him and I'm gonna put perfume on
[1:12:36] him I'm gonna give him ribbons
[1:12:39] but they're gonna go right back to that
[1:12:42] Hog Pen
[1:12:48] you know it's a fact but you know what
[1:12:50] the good thing about it is you don't
[1:12:52] know the difference either
[1:12:55] when we all start out
[1:12:59] some of us smell like Hawks
[1:13:02] some of us acted like Hawks
[1:13:05] but down on the inside of us we were
[1:13:07] sheep
[1:13:10] but we always worship
[1:13:14] we just need it to be cleaned up a
[1:13:17] little bit
[1:13:18] [Applause]
[1:13:20] we were born in sin and we were shaping
[1:13:23] an iniquity you were capable of a lot of
[1:13:27] bad things
[1:13:28] but God rich in Mercy
[1:13:36] oh brother Ron not me well I got a
[1:13:38] scripture for you all have sinned
[1:13:43] say it with me all have sinned and come
[1:13:47] short of the glory of God
[1:13:58] I want that to settle in just for a
[1:14:00] moment before we go too far here
[1:14:03] all have sinned
[1:14:06] so it gives none of us as a right to
[1:14:09] point fingers
[1:14:12] now now let me just say we have an
[1:14:15] accuser
[1:14:17] and that accuser he keeps a good list
[1:14:20] now see the devil doesn't know when you
[1:14:25] when you repent
[1:14:30] when you repent God wipes your slate
[1:14:34] clean
[1:14:39] when it comes down and gives you the new
[1:14:41] birth God takes your book that's got a
[1:14:44] lot of stuff in it now it don't only
[1:14:47] have your sins it's got your father's
[1:14:49] sins and your mother's sins good of
[1:14:51] people as they was they were carrying
[1:14:54] their mother's sins and their father's
[1:14:56] sins
[1:14:57] and it was passed down to you
[1:15:01] nobody taught you to steal the cookie
[1:15:05] nobody taught you when you were a little
[1:15:08] child when you got in a jam to tell a
[1:15:10] little white one
[1:15:13] not me not me listen not me lived at my
[1:15:18] house
[1:15:21] not me lived at my house and there were
[1:15:24] three not me's
[1:15:28] raised in Preachers home
[1:15:31] raised in a preacher's home not me lived
[1:15:34] at our house
[1:15:39] I bet not me lives in a lot of your
[1:15:41] houses
[1:15:50] now now I bring this to to a point
[1:15:55] when God came looking for Adam God knew
[1:16:00] where Adam was at
[1:16:04] but God as he begins to walk through the
[1:16:07] the Garden of Eden he's calling for Adam
[1:16:10] allowing Adam the opportunity
[1:16:15] to come clean
[1:16:17] he is hiding from God before sin he
[1:16:21] never hid from God
[1:16:24] he never hid from God he didn't even
[1:16:27] know he was naked but after sin came
[1:16:30] immediately
[1:16:32] he began to get religious
[1:16:36] and put on a cloak of covering to cover
[1:16:39] his sin
[1:16:42] and so
[1:16:44] God has a conversation with him
[1:16:47] and in that conversation he begins to to
[1:16:50] find out
[1:16:51] who caused the fall
[1:16:54] because God's given him some orders to
[1:16:57] where that
[1:16:58] do this but don't do this
[1:17:01] listen there would have never been a
[1:17:03] fall if Adam and Eve would have only
[1:17:06] listened to God
[1:17:08] but listen God prepared a blood before
[1:17:11] the foundation of the world
[1:17:15] he knew in the nature of humanity that
[1:17:18] we would fall
[1:17:20] listen man is always creating an eye a a
[1:17:24] trash Heap
[1:17:26] that's how archaeologists find out how
[1:17:30] people operated if they can only find
[1:17:33] the dump to where man lived at they can
[1:17:37] figure out what kind of dishes what kind
[1:17:39] of Cups what kind of things that they
[1:17:41] did what kind of work that they did are
[1:17:43] you with me now
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:46] I want you to understand there's a lot
[1:17:48] that can be known of your trash
[1:17:56] but man's nature is to heighten God a
[1:17:59] god that is all-knowing a god that is
[1:18:02] infinite he knows it anyway
[1:18:06] but but the serpent has always caused
[1:18:09] man to become religious and try to cover
[1:18:12] his sin up
[1:18:15] they scream for God to give them a law
[1:18:19] now listen
[1:18:20] God's the holy God
[1:18:23] so when God gave man a law to live by
[1:18:27] he gave them a law to which that was to
[1:18:31] his standards
[1:18:32] Humanity
[1:18:34] cannot live clean enough to God
[1:18:47] in Israel today
[1:18:49] yesterday would have been their Sabbath
[1:18:51] day
[1:18:52] it's an inconvenient they still live
[1:18:55] under the law
[1:18:57] there's no public transit
[1:18:59] people don't go 100 yards from their
[1:19:01] house or 100 feet from their house they
[1:19:04] can't collect wood they can't collect a
[1:19:06] lot of things
[1:19:08] elevators don't work
[1:19:11] because they live under the law
[1:19:13] escalators don't work it's a very
[1:19:16] inconvenient deal
[1:19:19] because they never recognize that Jesus
[1:19:22] came
[1:19:24] as the lord of the Harvest
[1:19:27] and the lord of the Sabbath Listen by
[1:19:32] grace are we saved
[1:19:36] well brother Ron I can live by the law
[1:19:39] well let me just give you a test
[1:19:43] we are Americans
[1:19:48] amen you're
[1:19:49] it'll probably work for you if you came
[1:19:51] from Europe but we're Americans
[1:19:55] being Americans we've married in and out
[1:19:57] in and out in and out
[1:20:01] and so under the law
[1:20:05] if you had an illegitimate child
[1:20:10] boy you're quiet now
[1:20:13] if you had an illegitimate child it
[1:20:16] cursed your family for 400 years
[1:20:23] I was thinking about this note as I was
[1:20:25] even coming to church today
[1:20:27] I I know most of you
[1:20:30] and most of you live under a curse
[1:20:35] not you
[1:20:37] but your forefathers
[1:20:43] brought forth
[1:20:45] without marriage
[1:20:48] children
[1:20:50] don't get holier than me
[1:20:54] my family's guilty too
[1:20:57] and I don't have to go far your family
[1:20:59] is guilty too
[1:21:01] so that means that 400 years of your
[1:21:05] Generations
[1:21:08] are cursed
[1:21:10] we need Jesus
[1:21:14] we need Jesus are you with me now
[1:21:21] I got a lot of stories I could tell
[1:21:22] right there but I got to go
[1:21:24] hmm
[1:21:28] the Israelites
[1:21:30] once settled
[1:21:32] and what they said what they were
[1:21:34] studying well I'm not worthy what else
[1:21:39] could I do
[1:21:41] you don't have to do nothing
[1:21:43] the only thing that you have to do is
[1:21:45] come under the shed blood
[1:21:49] the blood of Jesus Christ and that
[1:21:52] settles it once under the blood you're
[1:21:56] safe
[1:21:59] I don't cause you to take a deep breath
[1:22:02] what if the death angel with his sword
[1:22:05] in his hands sweeping the land
[1:22:08] you didn't have to wonder and to be
[1:22:11] scared
[1:22:12] to be scared was an insult to Jehovah
[1:22:17] if a man is once under the blood and
[1:22:19] feels afraid
[1:22:21] that God won't keep his word it's an
[1:22:24] insult
[1:22:26] Jehovah perhaps this is your word but I
[1:22:30] don't know whether it's right or not
[1:22:33] shame on you
[1:22:35] once under the blood he said I'm the
[1:22:38] Lord that healeth Thee I believe it
[1:22:40] that's all don't don't insult him
[1:22:45] he that cometh to me I will in no wise
[1:22:48] cast out I believe it once coming under
[1:22:50] the blood take the word
[1:22:55] take the word take the blood and every
[1:22:58] believer here it is get it every man and
[1:23:01] woman that that once has been under the
[1:23:05] blood of Jesus Christ all fear and
[1:23:09] condemnation is gone out
[1:23:14] then he will believe every word and God
[1:23:17] writes it in the Bible to be the truth
[1:23:20] he will not say this is not inspired and
[1:23:23] that's not inspired a Believer will
[1:23:26] believe every word of God
[1:23:32] all come to the Fountain that's filled
[1:23:34] with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
[1:23:38] wonderful savior that we have
[1:23:42] What A Plan of Redemption that we have
[1:23:46] what a plan that Jehovah has allotted
[1:23:49] for us laid out the carpet for us and
[1:23:52] come home to him
[1:23:55] we as Humanity have our memory Chambers
[1:23:59] but if we're not careful as human beings
[1:24:02] we'll dig up bones
[1:24:06] if it's been forgiven
[1:24:10] and God can't remember it why do you
[1:24:13] want to dig it up
[1:24:14] [Applause]
[1:24:22] it'll do you no good to dig it up over
[1:24:25] and over and over and over again
[1:24:28] oh
[1:24:30] that's husband and wife never did up old
[1:24:33] boyfriends and old girlfriends
[1:24:35] never look back to the past
[1:24:38] is past past has been forgiven move
[1:24:42] forward
[1:24:45] can you imagine salmon which is the
[1:24:48] captain
[1:24:49] when he married Rahab that was a harlot
[1:24:53] listen once she's married to Sal Moon
[1:24:57] and she has been redeemed through the
[1:24:59] talking token and she has believed those
[1:25:02] two spies her and her whole household
[1:25:05] were saved because the token of Jesus
[1:25:08] Christ
[1:25:10] but listen I would dare say to you when
[1:25:14] she becomes the queen under salmon that
[1:25:17] Salomon never brought her past up
[1:25:27] are you with me now
[1:25:30] you need another
[1:25:33] there was a man named Boaz
[1:25:36] that redeemed Naomi
[1:25:39] because Ruth was a part of the plan of
[1:25:42] God
[1:25:43] she had a past she had a history
[1:25:47] she had been an idol worshiper in her
[1:25:50] land
[1:25:51] which according to the law she was
[1:25:53] cursed
[1:25:55] but God had a Plan of Redemption and he
[1:25:58] was showing it through Ruth and Tamar
[1:26:01] and and he was showing it through Rahab
[1:26:04] I am a worthy one
[1:26:08] I can redeem you as the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:11] Christ I can wash away your sins
[1:26:15] are you with me I don't want to get too
[1:26:16] far ahead but listen as our Kinsmen
[1:26:19] Redeemer he don't remind us of our past
[1:26:25] you ought to give the Lord a hand right
[1:26:27] there
[1:26:27] [Applause]
[1:26:35] Redemption is not a sins credit card
[1:26:39] where God redeems you and washes away
[1:26:42] your twenty five thousand dollar debt on
[1:26:44] your credit card it doesn't give you a
[1:26:46] license to go fill it back up again
[1:26:52] it doesn't give us a right to make Grace
[1:26:54] a disgrace
[1:26:56] what can wash away our sins
[1:26:59] it's more than just a song what can wash
[1:27:02] away our sins nothing but the blood of
[1:27:05] Jesus Christ

[1:28:07] nature

[1:32:44] whoever we get Republican Democrat
[1:32:47] Federalists whatever we get
[1:32:50] we'll never be able to live up to their

[1:33:00] we're not I I'm sorry we're just not
[1:33:04] we're in the minority now
[1:33:06] but it doesn't mean that we have to
[1:33:09] succumb
[1:33:14] are you with me we're in this world but
[1:33:16] not of this world we have a citizenship
[1:33:19] from another Nation
[1:33:22] who's Builder and maker is God Abraham
[1:33:26] met the king in the Hebrews chapter 11
[1:33:28] said that he looked for a city whose
[1:33:31] Builder and maker was God why could you
[1:33:34] have such Faith to do that he met the
[1:33:37] king of that City
[1:33:41] we've met the king of that City
[1:33:45] uh
[1:33:47] don't you love the Lord
[1:33:52] we have an All-Seeing gun
[1:33:54] we think about
[1:33:57] we think about
[1:34:00] we think about I'll just tell this story
[1:34:02] brother biscoll has told it
[1:34:04] hundreds of times
[1:34:08] he said he was with brother Branham and
[1:34:12] he had three questions
[1:34:15] on this particular day
[1:34:17] they were going to kill some squirrels
[1:34:19] for
[1:34:21] for Camp meat
[1:34:23] so he said he actually asked brother Ed
[1:34:26] he said would you like to take a walk we
[1:34:27] need to kill some squirrels he said and
[1:34:29] after I walk with him a little while I
[1:34:31] realized that
[1:34:33] he really wasn't interested in hunting
[1:34:35] for squirrels
[1:34:36] he said he came to a place and sat down
[1:34:38] on a log
[1:34:40] and when he sat down on the log brother
[1:34:41] Eddie sat there and he said he put his
[1:34:44] knee up against him and
[1:34:46] and they begin to talk a little bit and
[1:34:48] then he he told him he said you have
[1:34:50] three questions
[1:34:53] brother Eddie was a young preacher he
[1:34:55] was somewhere in his early actually late
[1:34:58] 20s
[1:35:00] and there was some skepticism about
[1:35:02] about brother Branham he he had some
[1:35:05] thoughts because everybody was saying he
[1:35:07] was going off
[1:35:08] he was going off on the word he had an
[1:35:10] incredible Healing Ministry but he was
[1:35:12] he was going off on the word
[1:35:15] and was preaching that
[1:35:17] you know
[1:35:18] that Serpent's hate Doctrine he thought
[1:35:20] surely brother Brown can't be preaching
[1:35:22] now
[1:35:23] and so
[1:35:25] and so
[1:35:26] Eddie's now going to know brother
[1:35:27] Branham is more than just a preacher
[1:35:31] more than just the man
[1:35:33] but he's going to
[1:35:35] hear the voice behind The Voice
[1:35:38] and he's going to tell him me you've got
[1:35:40] three questions
[1:35:42] now God not only know your questions
[1:35:44] he's got the answer for you
[1:35:48] I'm really happy about that
[1:35:51] because I too had a lot of questions in
[1:35:54] my life
[1:35:55] and I'll be honest with you I don't know
[1:35:56] everything
[1:36:00] people call me with a question I go I
[1:36:03] don't know
[1:36:06] well brother on you ought to know
[1:36:10] listen if I knew everything I'd be the
[1:36:12] richest man in America
[1:36:15] because I'd buy the right stock
[1:36:19] and I'd be in the housing market when
[1:36:21] it's going
[1:36:23] and then I get out of it when it's
[1:36:28] I don't know everything
[1:36:30] so I still have to work
[1:36:32] yeah work
[1:36:34] work is a four-letter word but it's not
[1:36:37] a curse word
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:49] before that little visit was over
[1:36:54] he realized that God knew he's every
[1:36:56] thought
[1:36:58] he knew his every thought
[1:37:02] from that point
[1:37:04] brother Biscoe would begin to know that
[1:37:07] God knows the very secrets of our heart
[1:37:10] now let me just say this to you
[1:37:13] God knows you better than you know you
[1:37:20] because as your memory book will begin
[1:37:22] to go you'll forget a lot of your first
[1:37:24] chapters
[1:37:29] now he's standing in a prayer line and
[1:37:31] there's a lady there
[1:37:33] and as he's beginning to deal with this
[1:37:35] lady she she's there
[1:37:37] and he's beginning to talk to her you
[1:37:39] have a nervous condition
[1:37:41] well it's good to know that she has a
[1:37:43] nervous condition she knows that
[1:37:46] but now he's going to talk to her 40
[1:37:48] years ago
[1:37:50] you got off of a school bus
[1:37:53] and a dog chased you down the road
[1:37:56] and it caused a nervous condition to
[1:37:59] come on you
[1:38:00] she didn't remember that that even
[1:38:03] happened
[1:38:06] you want a second part A lady that is
[1:38:08] actually sister branham's friend
[1:38:11] she had a really bad nervous condition
[1:38:13] all the time tore up she hung around
[1:38:16] sister Branham because it it made her
[1:38:18] feel strong
[1:38:20] and so and so she wanted to be prayed
[1:38:23] for it she wanted to be healed she
[1:38:25] wanted to get rid of this and so
[1:38:28] and so
[1:38:29] she said when brother Branham is there
[1:38:31] and he feels the angel of the Lord maybe
[1:38:33] he'll pray for you so one day that
[1:38:35] actually happened
[1:38:36] he called her into the room and he's
[1:38:38] sitting there talking to her and
[1:38:41] and he said I see many years ago when
[1:38:43] your husband was away at War
[1:38:45] you was with another man and it was in a
[1:38:48] certain car and he told her what the car
[1:38:50] was and you come real close to getting
[1:38:52] run over at a railroad Exchange
[1:38:57] and you don't remember it because
[1:38:59] Satan's actually hid it in your memory
[1:39:01] think about that
[1:39:05] but God knows it
[1:39:08] but I want you to just notice God don't
[1:39:10] throw her away
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:15] he's got a cure for it
[1:39:18] he's got a cure for it God just don't
[1:39:20] call it out for no reason at all he
[1:39:23] knows that's laying there
[1:39:25] so he's provided a blood
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:30] I dare say there's some closets in this
[1:39:32] building today
[1:39:34] that haven't been open for a while
[1:39:37] and you don't want nobody to know
[1:39:44] so don't go get sanctimonious on me
[1:39:47] I know Humanity pretty well
[1:39:50] it was a man one time we had a Jericho
[1:39:53] March we got happy here we were shouting
[1:39:55] we were dancing and you know this guy
[1:39:57] got his family and wheeled them out of
[1:39:59] the building and you know he was all
[1:40:01] sanctimonious and self-righteous
[1:40:05] that was on a Saturday evening and so we
[1:40:08] went to Country Kitchen or country
[1:40:10] cooking
[1:40:11] back in the day
[1:40:14] and so we were sitting and we were
[1:40:16] sitting there and he said well I she saw
[1:40:18] me walk out
[1:40:19] last night we don't believe in that kind
[1:40:23] of worship and I didn't want my family
[1:40:25] to get influenced and and I wanted to
[1:40:28] get my children out as quickly as
[1:40:29] possible and we went out and
[1:40:32] and we don't want to be a part of any of
[1:40:34] that I said well okay
[1:40:36] okay
[1:40:38] I said the reason that you did that
[1:40:42] was last Tuesday evening
[1:40:44] you were sitting on your computer
[1:40:48] and you were looking at pornography
[1:40:52] and you got the computer cut off quick
[1:40:54] enough to when your wife began to walk
[1:40:57] in the room he went oh God
[1:41:01] his self-righteous Spirit didn't cover
[1:41:04] his sin
[1:41:06] you can know every scripture in the
[1:41:09] Bible are you with me now I'm gonna
[1:41:10] preach to you
[1:41:11] I've laid my Foundation now I'm going to
[1:41:13] preach to you you can know every
[1:41:15] scripture from not the eyes and cross
[1:41:18] the t's you can know the message all
[1:41:19] backwards and forwards but if it don't
[1:41:22] live
[1:41:24] don't tell me about your recipe I don't
[1:41:27] care how well you can cook if it don't
[1:41:31] live on Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:41:32] Thursday Friday Saturday and Sunday
[1:41:46] or some people want to argue scriptures
[1:41:48] why waste your time
[1:41:51] I want to argue such generally people
[1:41:54] that want to argue the Bible are hiding
[1:41:56] something
[1:42:01] people that are getting self-righteous
[1:42:03] and want to go back to the law are
[1:42:05] really hiding something
[1:42:09] because the blood of Jesus Christ takes
[1:42:11] care of every sin
[1:42:14] it takes care of every sin
[1:42:32] help me Jesus the clock is flying
[1:42:36] and I got some ways to go
[1:42:40] brother Ron can you prove a couple
[1:42:42] things to me I'm glad you asked
[1:42:48] Jesus said he was the lord of the
[1:42:49] Sabbath
[1:42:53] so he has to prove it
[1:42:58] they brought a woman according to the
[1:43:01] law
[1:43:02] that should be murdered in the street
[1:43:05] you see she had been caught in the act
[1:43:07] of adultery
[1:43:10] and those priests didn't have a way to
[1:43:12] clean her
[1:43:14] but they did have a law they actually
[1:43:16] had scripture
[1:43:19] they had scripture
[1:43:23] and they said she should be stoned they
[1:43:26] actually did it as a temptation to Jesus
[1:43:29] what would he do with this adulterous
[1:43:32] woman
[1:43:36] if he is the lord of the Sabbath if he
[1:43:38] is the law living
[1:43:40] what will he do
[1:43:45] the law said she should be stoned
[1:43:47] she has been dragged into the street
[1:43:51] she has been brought
[1:43:53] from the Hog Pen of life
[1:43:56] and now she's been brought before the
[1:43:59] Messiah
[1:44:00] who knows all things anyway
[1:44:04] what will God do with me
[1:44:10] preachers
[1:44:13] men that knew the law from beginning to
[1:44:15] end
[1:44:17] to be a Pharisee they would roll up the
[1:44:20] Scrolls put a pin through it and the
[1:44:22] examination of you becoming a Pharisee
[1:44:25] was that you had to know every scripture
[1:44:27] that that pen went through
[1:44:32] say that would unqualify most of us
[1:44:35] sitting here today
[1:44:41] now Jesus didn't argue scripture with
[1:44:43] them
[1:44:46] I would probably disappoint them
[1:44:49] he didn't he didn't argue he didn't
[1:44:51] argue scripture with him
[1:44:54] he uh
[1:44:57] he did something very unusual
[1:45:00] and I'd say if I was the one standing
[1:45:02] there guilty of this law
[1:45:07] listen I'm in trouble
[1:45:09] I'm in real trouble I I don't know what
[1:45:11] he's going to do
[1:45:14] but I'm going to die in a few minutes
[1:45:17] these guys are not going to give me any
[1:45:19] Mercy
[1:45:24] they're not going to give me any Mercy
[1:45:27] I'll tell you what you're going to find
[1:45:28] about me I'm going to I'm going to give
[1:45:30] you more Mercy
[1:45:33] I've never found a stone to throw at you
[1:45:37] and here's why
[1:45:40] Jesus got down on the ground
[1:45:46] and before when he hit the ground
[1:45:48] Brother Ray he said
[1:45:51] he that is without sin
[1:45:57] cast the first stone
[1:46:02] now listen if Jesus could see her sin he
[1:46:07] could see theirs
[1:46:15] listen God's Fair
[1:46:19] he's really fair
[1:46:21] you remember you remember last week I
[1:46:23] did something I've never seen done
[1:46:24] sister Connie I've never seen it done
[1:46:26] I've never heard of it being done but
[1:46:29] God dealt with me
[1:46:32] immediately when I saw you sitting right
[1:46:34] there I took my coat off
[1:46:37] and I wrapped it around you
[1:46:40] I didn't know why
[1:46:43] matter of fact I was puzzled
[1:46:46] there's people in this building probably
[1:46:47] think what's he doing preacher took his
[1:46:50] coat off and wrapped it around you
[1:46:52] Andrew picked it up exactly what was
[1:46:55] happening when that child came home the
[1:46:59] father was looking for he went and got
[1:47:01] his robe
[1:47:05] [Applause]
[1:47:12] he wouldn't got his robe and wrapped it
[1:47:14] around him welcome home welcome home
[1:47:19] I don't care what kind of hold pen
[1:47:21] you've been in but welcome home I don't
[1:47:24] want to know your history but welcome
[1:47:26] home
[1:47:28] [Applause]
[1:47:30] thank you
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:46] I've been here as your pastor of 23 24
[1:47:48] years
[1:47:51] none of you can say that I've asked you
[1:47:54] for your history
[1:48:01] none of you
[1:48:04] I'm not even interested
[1:48:06] oh
[1:48:12] well if that person is not right you
[1:48:14] need to kick him out of church oh no
[1:48:15] this is the place you need to be
[1:48:17] [Applause]
[1:48:28] this is your place
[1:48:30] and this ain't a halfway house this is a
[1:48:32] Transformation Center you stick around
[1:48:34] long enough you'll meet Jesus you'll
[1:48:37] become a pillar of this church
[1:48:39] he'll change your life
[1:48:47] Hallelujah
[1:48:49] [Applause]
[1:48:59] Jesus wrote secret sins on them
[1:49:04] and they knew he knew
[1:49:07] and they knew
[1:49:08] that if I kill her with a stone that I'm
[1:49:11] guilty of murder
[1:49:16] if he's home if he's whole if he knows
[1:49:18] what my sin is and then I cast the stone
[1:49:20] I'm guilty a murderer
[1:49:22] listen don't never murder people with
[1:49:24] your tongue
[1:49:28] that thing right there is dangerous
[1:49:33] instead of talking about people pray for
[1:49:35] him
[1:49:37] instead of criticize and pray for them
[1:49:40] Life's Too Short look over at your
[1:49:42] neighbor life's short

[1:49:48] the story tonight though life's short
[1:49:52] you getting off at the next stop life's
[1:49:54] short
[1:50:00] and Jesus
[1:50:02] finishes
[1:50:03] he looks up
[1:50:08] he asked an incredible question
[1:50:11] woman
[1:50:14] where
[1:50:15] is thine accusers

[1:51:06] city
[1:51:08] I don't think any of us can fathom on

[1:51:16] and trees never shed a leaf
[1:51:20] we're dear do not have an enemy against

[1:51:59] where there's no beer joints
[1:52:04] oh we got a king
[1:52:06] but we're gonna love him
[1:52:09] nobody has to run for mayor

[1:52:49] profession

[1:53:15] tossed themselves there
[1:53:17] Russia's prisons are just about empty
[1:53:19] because they're sending them to war

[1:53:32] something good
[1:53:35] in that City

[1:55:03] in chapter 7 I'll just quote these
[1:55:05] things to you Paul says
[1:55:08] Wretched Man
[1:55:10] that I am
[1:55:13] he talks about how horrible he is in his
[1:55:15] flesh
[1:55:16] in his flesh
[1:55:20] but through the blood of Jesus Christ he
[1:55:22] can say this
[1:55:23] therefore
[1:55:26] let's read it together
[1:55:28] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:55:32] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:55:36] who walk not after the flesh
[1:55:46] so let me just say this to you if you're
[1:55:49] free from your sin
[1:55:51] quit bringing it up
[1:56:02] mankind has been married
[1:56:04] and I want to I just want to share this
[1:56:06] with you
[1:56:08] we're getting ready to have our 40th
[1:56:10] anniversary
[1:56:12] brother Thomas congratulations
[1:56:15] 50 years
[1:56:25] Barbara too Barbara too
[1:56:27] [Applause]
[1:56:29] he didn't do that all by himself
[1:56:34] Thomas told me one time we were cutting
[1:56:36] wood and splitting it in the woods
[1:56:38] and he stopped splitting and he he said
[1:56:41] now Ron
[1:56:43] we were dating
[1:56:46] she really loves you
[1:56:48] and he told me these words don't hurt
[1:56:50] her
[1:56:54] three years ago I prayed a prayer
[1:57:04] I prayed a prayer
[1:57:06] that said Lord
[1:57:08] when they were giving me four months to
[1:57:10] live I said Lord
[1:57:12] let me live
[1:57:14] to when we're married 40 years
[1:57:17] I want to say thank you thank you God
[1:57:22] [Applause]
[1:57:36] yeah I bought her that ring she ain't
[1:57:38] got it yet but I bought her that ring
[1:57:40] she needs a ring a necklace
[1:57:43] new robe for putting up with me all
[1:57:46] these years
[1:57:49] but the Lord knew what kind of person
[1:57:51] she was she's going to need all this
[1:57:52] preaching
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:57:58] give her a good hand
[1:58:00] [Applause]
[1:58:10] I have a point to that
[1:58:14] we don't bring up each other's past
[1:58:24] she felt the same enemy that I fought
[1:58:27] and that was the devil
[1:58:31] so we don't sit at the table and talk
[1:58:33] about our weaknesses or our failures of
[1:58:35] what we did before we were married
[1:58:37] we don't do that
[1:58:40] matter of fact we don't bring up each
[1:58:42] other's failures
[1:59:00] I was at the doctor this last week
[1:59:03] he's a bow tie doctor
[1:59:07] he's a teacher
[1:59:10] and he was telling other doctors he said
[1:59:12] no
[1:59:14] I want you to look Ron's lost about 50
[1:59:17] pounds
[1:59:22] and he said
[1:59:24] it's one of his number one complaints is
[1:59:26] he don't have strength he has a hard
[1:59:28] time with strength keeping strength
[1:59:31] and he was explaining to those doctors
[1:59:34] he said this he said we gave him certain
[1:59:37] medicines to help him because we knew he
[1:59:39] would have a lack of strength
[1:59:42] so we brought him from
[1:59:45] from the 220s to the 170s
[1:59:48] so he can carry him
[1:59:53] I thought boy that's a sermon
[1:59:56] you see God knew that we couldn't carry
[1:59:58] those sins
[2:00:03] we couldn't constantly carry those sins
[2:00:07] so he gave us a toxin
[2:00:10] a medicine
[2:00:12] that could get him off of us
[2:00:15] are you with me now
[2:00:17] I'm done I'm just giving you some
[2:00:18] freebie stuff here
[2:00:20] it's kind of like a free dessert to him
[2:00:23] you don't have to carry your memory
[2:00:25] anymore
[2:00:28] just give it to Jesus
[2:00:30] you don't have to constantly beat
[2:00:32] yourself anymore
[2:00:35] brother Ron I need a scripture
[2:00:40] I got one
[2:00:42] take those beset in sins and put them
[2:00:45] aside that
