and was able to do it had quite a bit of trouble doing that but they got it done and sister Nancy was set free from the hospital this afternoon and she's home sister Denise is watching over her

you one time I was in Switzerland and and we'd been there many times together and and I was it was a night to where that I was so sick I thought I was going to die I call Connie and and uh we talked she got extremely worried and extremely tore up we prayed that God would send me an angel and within 15 minutes my angel knocked on the door and he said I just want to check on you I tell you what he looked like he had wings on him that night and he went and got some kind of concoction from somebody he didn't even remember it and he went and got some some medicine about it the nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth and I drank that and I went to sleep at three o'clock in the morning and when I woke up at six it was over and I brother Biscoe met me in the in the hallway he said are you ready to preach and I said yes and I preached on what will you be remembered for and we had some absolute phenomenal miracles happen in that Joshua vonderbrandt is now a preacher from that meeting and brother biscoll got a phenomenal mind-blowing miracle in that meeting but you know God just does special things and all you can just say is you were there when it happened and and uh I just I'm just so thankful to have them with me I'm Overjoyed I've almost got the Jitters from it so amen so glad to have you brother and so we love you with all of our hearts and I'm going to have him greet you in the morning and uh so so we we certainly are so thrilled to have him also brother Nathaniel sister Caitlin of course this is second home and uh so we're so glad to have you guys with us and thank you all of you for coming last night to the meeting at brother marks and I pass along thanks again and we had a wonderful meeting there and for those that missed it well guess what the Lord's provided I'm going to preach the same thing tonight amen so it's not going to ever come out the same way and it's got a lot of new notes in it but hey man you'll you won't feel too left out and so but anyway we had a wonderful time and I gave some of you a scare but thank you for your prayers real quickly and my sugar dropped to 48 in the pulpit and the alarms kept going off and I kept preaching and and Gabriel kept feeding me Coke amen so we we lost the comrade last night brother Roy Shrewsbury went to be with the Lord and for those that know brother Roy how many new brother Roy brother Royce Shrewsbury is an ambassador of the message he was a giant he was a general he was one of the greatest gentlemen that I ever knew and uh he we loved him he called me son and I was very pleased for him to call me son and preached for him so many times and we had such a great relationship uh you mind if I tell you a couple of stories of brother Roy of course you've saw the you saw the movie of the world war experience of he shared with you but one of the things that outstood out to me was brother Roy very early in his ministry he had went to a meeting in Pennsylvania where A.A Allen was preaching and they asked brother Roy if he would be the preliminary speaker and give him about 20 minutes brother Roy stepped to the platform a very huge audience of people and he just started talking about how great Jesus is and and went right down the line of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ baptism and all of these and all of these things and he began to speak to them he said and I was sitting right behind it he said I took my seat right behind A.A Allen as he was preaching and he said he started and he said all those preachers around and said it felt like a hundred or so preachers on the platform and and he said hey Alan started preaching a trinity Doctrine and he said all of them started screaming amen and he said I'm sitting in the wrong Church I said what'd you do he said I just got up I just walked right down the aisle he said I'll stand for Jesus amen brother Roy was with brother branham's coughing coughing and and he said I found myself alone with the coffin and brother branham's body and he said I prayed a prayer and it always stood out to me he said I prayed a prayer he said Lord don't let this love leave the Earth that this man had he said let me have just a piece of it I believe his prayer was answered and amen and we loved him with all of our hearts and I I so I so loved him and after the cancer diagnosis of brain cancer had been told to me brother Roy said he was down praying and he he said brother Ron and he would he would he would call me periodically and and he called me and said brother Ron God spoke to me while I was praying for you and he said when he spoke to me he said I'm sending brother Ron into the lion's den like Daniel and he said it's a place where no words ever lived before and I'm sending him in but tell him what Daniel told the king O King I'll see you in the morning Amen brother Roy we'll see you come Resurrection morning and so please pray for the church there brother Ron Lily's the pastor now preaches friend of ours and and just remember them into prayer the family in prayer of course when you get when you get 98 years old a lot of your friends have already went on I'll never forget he was kind of standing kind of feeble and he he was standing in he came to our dedication meeting here if you remember it came to many of our Labor Day services and it was quite a dignitary in his ways and he told me he said it kind of looked kind of above my head and he said brother Ron I've got more on the other side than I've got over here now so he's been shaking hands for a while and so so we serve we so loved we so loved him and his family and and we want to pray that God would just minister to them Amen brother Andrew was at brother Donnie Reagan's this weekend they had a wonderful service last night I he maybe done this afternoon now but they're having wonderful Services he'll preach in the morning at brother Donnie's and and brother William just got back from other Dale's had wonderful meetings there we're so glad that their trip was safe we sure prayed for that brother William amen sure proud of you with all of our hearts and hey don't we love the Lord with all of our hearts tonight any good to us our Buddy's brother Tim Pruitt is in Germany he and brother Timothy and we're praying for that meeting that God would just they've already had their Saturday evening service and it really it went really well and and uh he just sent me a note just a moment ago and so we just we're just we're we're finishing this race that's what we're doing we're finishing it so amen let's stand to our feet amen so I'm glad morning when this life is or I'll I'll Fly Away amen well some glad morning when this life is or two on God's Celestial Shore will I gonna fly away let's sing [Music] [Applause] one more time still alive It's Gonna Fly Away [Music] you believe that amen God bless you if you'll turn with me in your word the scripture this afternoon First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24 and then we'll go to Genesis chapter 5. foreign God bless you First Corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24. I think Paul when he's writing this I think he's saying it's a very incredible things to us I don't want to waste my time and waste my energies I want to be very specific and whenever I think about these scriptures I think about brother biscoll preached a sermon one time called be thou an example and he said I don't want to waste my time and I don't think any of us want to do that and at this juncture of my life I don't want to waste any energy I want to make sure I give it all to the Lord Paul Reed writes it like this know you not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striving for the Mastery is temperant in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown but we and incorruptable I therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that beat the air see what I'm saying but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway Genesis chapter 5 and verse 22. an Enoch walk with God after he began Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 365 years an Enoch walk with God and he was not for God took him and I want to say this to you I believe that I'm preaching to an audience that are going to fulfill some of these same prophecy and Ron Spencer walk with God I'd like for you to put your name there and Ron Spencer walk with God and he was not for God took him quite a testimony isn't it amen let's pray Lord Jesus we love you with all of our hearts we've gathered here this evening to hear from you Lord we have prayed we've laid a psych time to prepare ourselves much thoughts on these words now Lord I ask you not only to inspire the speaker but may you inspire every person here strengthen our hearts strengthen our bodies minister to us bless our guests here this evening brother Johnny that's came brother Glenn and his wife that's with us and the others that are here father we ask you that you would just give them strength and Lord pass by our way that we would know father without a doubt more than a man came to where I was setting touch our hearts now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen you may be seated I'd like to speak to you tonight and probably in the morning on so this is it so this is it there comes a time when prophecy intercepts with time and prophecy is no longer a projection of the thoughts of God or the attributes of the thoughts of God but now we be in the living physical attributes of God before the foundation of the world and then we came into existence and we're not just here to see if we could be made but God has a purpose for us and then we fulfill that purpose and then that purpose is fulfilled then our time is over and God takes us home kind of the dash that we live in our lives Enoch didn't have a book about himself to where that he that he had to he could understand this is the way it's going to be no doubt in his life is as he's walking and he's got very special grandfathers he's the Sabbath from Adam like you're the Sabbath Church age from the second Adam and so the first Adam had fellowship with Enoch and walked with Enoch for decades can you imagine some of those conversations that they must have had I would have wanted to absorb everything that Adam had to say Adam talking about when God the Jehovah God would come down and after he had made him The Keeper of the garden after he would come down in the evening and ask him like our Prophet would say have you had a good day it would come down in his presence would spell out l-o-v-e what a special time for God and His creation on the earth in the Garden of Eden when everything was perfect there was not one Speck of death in the Garden of Eden not one Speck of darkness in the Garden of Eden man was having fellowship with God what Adam stepped out of is really what we're getting ready to step back into we're going to a place where there's no Darkness we're going to place where there's no death if we can understand that you and I have never seen a forest that that that doesn't have a leaf at the bottom we've never seen a Rose Garden that petals a fell off of we've never seen that kind of word death had set in but Adam fellowshipped were there was a perfect Rose Garden would project a place to where that even in heaven he would talk about were eternal life we don't understand time and he said he said sister Gertie he said maybe you're there and he says Where Have You Been she said oh I've been down by the Rose Garden for 500 years so that's a long time well you've never been in God's Rose Garden [Music] no doubt Adam and Enoch talked about that but I cannot imagine Even Adam looking at what the fall produced Adam had to make a choice and in making the choice to save Eve when she was found contaminated listen it just wasn't Eve now the world was contaminated and she be in his bride he had to respond some way and he being a type of God had to place his seed inside of her womb to preserve her let me just say the special thing about you tonight is God placed his seed inside of your womb of your soul that our realm of you will perish that spirit will go back to where it came from but that Gene seed of God that God placed there God can no more deny that than deny himself Hallelujah no doubt they had incredible Fellowship but now in this realm Adam is watching what unbelief has done to the Earth thorns and thistles and work human unbelief has destroyed the world now in Enoch's time it's the most scientific age that it's ever been brother man would say much higher than even our age and and so and so they would Fellowship no doubt around some of those incredible thoughts about how far the fall fall had came babies dying people dying but yet people had lived up to 900 and some years Adams Way up in his 900 years but God won't allow a man to live past a thousand before he takes him off of the Earth but sin was multiplied there was multiplying and and if I can just drop this here I didn't get to it last night but if I could just drop this here Adam had a hope and that's what he instilled inside of Enoch while he was being cast out of the Garden of Eden the sin that had taken upon himself was casting him out of the garden but God provided a way back [Applause] he provided a way back Enoch couldn't provide friends or or Adam could not provide for himself he couldn't cover his own sin but God provided a lamb brother Branham said he said God took a sheep he pulled the skin off of him as a type of himself wrapped Adam and Eve with that skin around them in the Garden of Eden as they're leaving he said love called him to do that other man said Eve with that blonde hair laid her head over on his muscle shoulders and they wept as they were going out and they said they heard something slappy and said it was no skin slapping against their legs blood running down their body God providing a way back listen we're all lost if God doesn't provide us a way back [Applause] and if you could say anything to Enoch we're going back we're going back to where I fell as shipped this world's not going to be this way forever listen Saints what you're witnessing now it's not going to always be this way [Applause] in Hebrews chapter 11. and I want you to read this with your own person in mind by faith innocuous translated that he should not see death and was not found because God translated him brother Ron do you believe that I not only believe that but I believe I'm going to be translated for before he had this translation he had this testimony that he pleased God major statement he didn't please his family he didn't please his home he didn't believe he didn't police the politics he didn't please nobody else and probably didn't please himself but he pleased God I'd like to say to you that's why I want my testimony brother under you believe I can listen not with these eyes but I believe the blood can be so applied to our life that when God sees through his own blood there's not an imperfection there's not a spot there's not a wreck on I believe God sees himself in our lives [Applause] but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and he is a rewarder that to them that diligently seek him by faith Noah Enoch and Noah's always put together Enoch's grandfather by faith eat Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark for to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world by the witch he condemned the world by the which your life condemns the world by the witch your life judges your neighbor you say brother on but they've never been to this church but they see your sermon they see your sermon every one of you is a preacher oh brother I ain't feel led to preach live the sermon live the sermon live the sermon by the which he condemned the world and became the heir of righteousness which is of faith what incredible words Enoch had a testimony of by faith that he pleased God Jude would write this about Enoch and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied Prophet a sight of these Sands behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints Enoch wasn't just walking but Enoch was excelling the first Bibles was written in the heavens every Star was in its place written out now how did it get there brother Branham says he said it was kind of like a little light he said God was just like a light swirling and he said let there be a son and God believed his own word and the son came into existence and then planets and stars and he said a clinker would fall off of the sun and it would fall for millions of years and God would stop it every every Star in its exact place you and I look up and they look like they're that close together we look at the Milky Way no way can you count the Stars if you remember Abraham as a child he doesn't have a child but God looks at him and says that he's going to be the father of Nations God doesn't look him as a fatherless man but he looks at the book of life and the Lamb's Book of Life Abraham can you count the sand so shall thy seed be that had to have been overwhelming can you count the Stars so shall thy seek be are you with me God wrote that God rose that brother brother Brown said in the second the second let me just pause here just a moment never been a messenger ever stood on the earth and explained how it all came into existence but the mighty Angel Christ himself thought you needed to know he thought you needed to know because one of those Stars represents you on the Earth [Applause] are you with me now listen God's not just going to start a job he's going to finish his job Hallelujah no I cannot imagine the instructions given to Enoch now to write the second Bible but to do it on the Earth he's an engineer he's building pyramid and under the orchestration of God he's literally going to write the Bible so perfect until man can't figure it out today as a matter of fact the angle it is still mystically impossible to for science to figure out how that Enoch placed the pyramid perfectly we talk about that Caribou 42-inch horns still that way well the same God that got that Caribou it's the same God that had that pyramid set exactly on the lines exactly they're not an inch off [Applause] perfect ly placed there and the the sides of that pyramid is exactly on the same angle as the curvature of the Earth and it's exactly perfectly in the middle of the Earth Egypt didn't have that kind of knowledge let's just say it Egypt didn't have that kind of knowledge I'd say this when the seals were revealed and the Thunders were revealed and the church Ages were revealed there's not a church in the world had that kind of knowledge they didn't have it it's not even up for negotiation brother random wasn't guessing when he said who was on the first church or horse rider Billy Graham was all over the place with the church horse riders all over the place wrote books on it didn't even come close I thought it was interesting this week that the messenger of sodom's son Mr Sodom being Billy Graham and if you'll remember Billy Graham was the pastor of our presidents even on 9-1-1 when that horrific event took place there was only one civilian aircraft in the air that day and that aircraft was carrying Billy Graham to where George Bush was at I'd have to say he did his job but Franklin Graham went on record to say that hell is on the Earth every demon from hell has been loosed on the Earth about 50 years too late saying it when the seals were released every demon in hell was released on the earth and the seeds of all of that now is shown what Enoch knew was coming the sins of the world was getting so bad that destruction was on its way and he prophesied there's one coming a second Adam's coming do it first Adam brought death second Adam will bring life [Music] are you with me oh what a redeemer Oh What A Savior Enoch wrote this this Bible on the Earth so perfectly man couldn't understand it no doubt even the air channels as they're being built they look directly into the heavens and see a certain constellation of stars every one of them with prophetic importance probably the people that was working with Enoch no doubt did not understand no way could comprehend what Enoch was writing but that pyramid still stands it still stands I want you to think about this that second Bible that stands there today has stood there while Noah's flagged went over top of it imagine how many wars have taken place that tried to destroy it God won't let his word be destroyed he'll not let his word be destroyed man has tried to punch holes in this and tear out scriptures and tear out things that this is not inspired this is not for this day God won't let us learn he won't let his word be destroyed people say well I'll take the Bible over top of the message you're crazy the Bible and the message are the same [Applause] this is Jesus Christ and the message is Jesus Christ [Applause] you can amen you can Shout here's the important thing we're in the book we're in the boat and if the book can't be destroyed [Applause] you can't destroy me [Applause] no if I could just lay that there for a moment can you imagine in the scientific age how people want to throw darts at the word of God you and I live in an age who are they they don't even have a compass anymore where's the real man where's the real women they wouldn't vote in Abraham Lincoln if their life depended on it they wouldn't vote in George Washington if their life depended on it Teddy Roosevelt they tried to kill him over and over and over again but he finally got elected why you bring him up yes these men were hay hate it listen being hated as a politician is not a new thing it's in Chicago and he was getting ready to to speak a speech and a man a barber shot him in the chest foreign it went through his eyeglass cover and then through his speech went into his ribs stuck his hand in his in his in his side and pulled it out and it was all bloody and he said they shot me but I'm gonna still give your speech he said cause you can't shut me up and he spoke for 84 minutes on the man in the arena I have that hanging on my wall I have it in my library some of you gave me plaques of the man in the arena may I stand as a man in the arena unafraid as I said last week on that Resurrection morning George Washington's welcome here he may not be welcome in government or in any churches in this in this United States he's welcome here Abraham Lincoln is welcome here that conflicts with my political view you're dismissed they're dismissed just can I give a couple more statements here because in a woke they're in a woke movement and they don't even know what it is hell has has opened up its Gates that's woke but they're too late the bride woke up a long time ago and I want to make a declaration for you if this message did not awaken you for the rapture [Music] prepare yourself Thrift tribulation period [Applause] you have not seen bad times yet but they're coming [Applause] the seeds that have been sowed are now ready to be harvested Enoch knew as he trans preached and spoke the word there was a redeemer coming he was placing the Bible on the Earth and all of his work in all of his work and all of that there was one thing that was a constant in his life his atmosphere was walking with God I purposely tried to disturb your feelings in a few ways just today as of right now I am boycotting the news I'm tired of waking up every morning and seeing how many schools have been shot up all right I I I'm at a I'm at a point in my life to where I've had enough of politicians lies [Applause] lies brother Ron but I'm so concerned with the debt ceiling listen our America plant they they can print money at a moment's notice don't get yourself so tore up [Music] so you like and I like Enoch must walk in Two Worlds at the same time Enoch with all the perversion in his day and you must remember you must remember this God is a just God and so many talks about how mean God is God so mean God's so rough really you don't know the God I know I I literally love to surfing oh but he makes me dress a certain way that's your protection [Music] listen when he told you how to be married you can have a peaceful home love one another you don't have to raise your I'm not here to preach that but you can have a home to where you can feel the presence of God and literally it be so powerful until it feels like your hair is going to stand on your head at times that warm presence am I the only one [Applause] he's welcome he's welcome that's what this message produces that's what this message produces that's right that's right that's what this church produces young people that are truly Godly amen we're not a bunch of mixers we're not a bunch of halfway people we're real we're real I want to be real I want to be real I don't want to be put on I don't want to be fake I hate Halloween it's from the pit of Hell it's absolutely right from the pit of Hell I always taught my children it's from the pit of Hell because that's where it's from that's its Origins it's because a person can be a normal person all of a sudden put on a mask can put on a mask and all of a sudden they can play a character listen we don't want our church to be like that where you put on a fast mask put on a false mask and and all of a sudden you you you can act a certain way on Sunday but Monday it don't live what's the highest form of hypocrisy this should live 24 hours a day [Applause] brother Ron but I participate in Halloween stop it's not that difficult just stop it was a time in my life I drank beer Jesus came into my life I quit doctors told me Monday said don't don't put chocolate candy in your mouth I tell you what that's going to be a difficult thing somebody's watching your life most of the time it's your children that's right I told this last night I want to tell it today I mean it was there last night well good you guys know where to say Amen many years ago your father and I sat on a porch together with about 10 other preachers some brothers in the church we were fellowshipping there's a man sitting beside of me I knew him for years was a man sitting beside him he's not a preacher he wasn't a deacon he wasn't he was just a man of the church and was sitting there and I'm I don't try to ever be a rude person I I try I try not to be rude and you know he had a mustache and and then he had hair growing out of his nose and I've always thought that no that wasn't nice every time I'd look I see the hair in the nose you know and in the moment I caught his spirit Connie knows this is to be the truth and I said why haven't you quit that little habit and he just responded these words it's not hurting anybody and I said well you know your children are small they're playing here in the yard and your wife is in the house and I said this you know things are real good right now but your children's watching and as as your children grow up and now you're going to have to correct them because they're going to come to some spots to where you have to be their Holy Ghost and you have to stop them and say no don't do that don't don't do that and they're going to look at you and say but Daddy you know how long you've been doing that and there will come a time to where that you can't call them back to correction [Applause] and then your wife is is in there and she's going to look at you and she's going to know you've lived a hypocritical life they'll go into every service and one day and I said I'm going to prophesy to you one day there's going to come to time to work she's going to leave you his children grew up and that's exactly what happened I've actually had to talk to some of them and his wife came to a certain stage and now because of his hypocrisy now she's in love with another man of A different race left him married this other man it could have been corrected on a porch I'm preaching to you now I'm taking a story on her coming to your house oh brother Ron but it don't matter really really Matthew and myself are driving down the road and I said Matthew how long you been doing that I knew I couldn't hide it from you Daddy I said you hid it from me a long time I said but God showed it to me that moment Matthew repented that moment he repented wasn't something great big but it was something that down the road would have destroyed his home his family his health listen I want a preacher I want some real daddies some real men that will be men anybody can produce a baby but real man that'll be real Holy Ghost feel men I love God in my home I kind of hurt him I'm a little off Target here for a moment but there's not one thing I would ever do and I've had this policy forever that I would ever do to try to disappoint that girl I wouldn't want to hurt her I wouldn't want my conduct and my decisions and word to go back to her that would hurt her that's how much I love her because I love her like the scripture says more than myself and if you don't have that philosophy in your marriage listen when you get married it ain't the good old boy club no more it ain't the body system no more it ain't back when I was a teenager no more you're married you marry your best friend you marry your best buddy gaiman's over everything's over and if it isn't like that if you're not going into your marriage like that stop it Well Ron that's strong I told your kids that isn't that right it didn't hurt their feelings I try to tell every married couple that listen when your buddies think you think more of your buddies than you do your wife you're in trouble most of the time you want to hang out with your buddies more than you do your wife you're a homosexual who's your best friend brother Ron right there I got buddies sure I got buddies well right there's the best one we stepped out of Eternity into time and I got a promise we'll step back again by the way our wives look like sisters so we've got a good taste to what I'm talking about brother on those things have been difficult a little hard to swallow right in the middle of the sermon we was we were shouting a little while ago we're here to please God I want to have this testimony that God can say I have rights to Rapture him do you think that God in Enoch were the only parties that were involved there was enough there was an accuser of the brethren that was watching him build the Bible that was walking he's watching his atmosphere just to prepare you my next sermon of the week after I'm going to preach on sweeping sin under the rug so if you think these last few minutes have been tough you might want to schedule your vacation but the accuser of the Brethren was watching Enoch's walk and this is a phenomenal thought to me all of Hell could not affect Enoch great amen I want to bring it to your day Stephanie sister Stephanie if you could just Place yourself in the scriptures that I had you all and I'm not just calling her out I'm calling all of you out but I don't have time to call all your names Place yourself in the scriptures there's more than just two people in the in the party here God in you oh but it's it's Jerry and it's the baby and it's this and that let me just say this to you two of the men want to be taken it's an individual affair we're going to universally be raptured together but nobody's crutching one another up it's you and God it's you and my personal experience with God listen God don't send nobody to hell God say this with me God sends nobody to hell you send yourself to hell [Applause] songs preachers poetry and even even God wrote in the heavens we'll get to it in the morning God wrote in the heavens a sermon every time you have a storm God reminds you I'll not destroy the Earth with water I didn't finish but Satan no matter what he does do you Stephanie he can't get you that's pretty powerful it's pretty powerful and Enoch walk with God and he lived in Two Worlds I hear Brother Branham when he's up there he said that there was a storm coming and the storm was coming in it was a blizzard some of the brothers he instructed him to leave and they left there was a couple Brothers decided to stay and he said well I'll stay with you and he said when you start seeing the flakes fall he said you get back to the tent you get back to the camp as fast as you can brother Brandon was having a prayer meeting and he said the flake started falling he was in the kind of country to where there could be a foot of snow on the ground in a in a very quick moment and actually could be three feet in no time flat and brother random as well is is now getting ready to go back off of that mountain and he feels that presence of the Lord listen he knew what that was about I think that's something we need to know the presence of the Lord and God speaks to him and brother Brown takes off his hat now listen if he don't get back to that camp he's in trouble but God's more important than that storm and he and he told him he told him he says speak to that storm and he spoke to that storm your pastor told me this he told him about the speaking the storm out of existence he likened it unto the woman in Memphis that her son was dying of syphilis at 19 years old and in Memphis she was a nobody never heard of William Branham but she prayed a prayer where is my Elijah and that prayer didn't speak a storm out of existence but it brought one into existence that would ground his plane and two occurrences God speaks to him come walk with me God's calling us to a higher walk I believe that's what these sermons are about we're to a higher walk [Music] brother brennaman actually your pastor actually said how did you know which way to go and he said brother Branham said I turned and looked into a store window saw myself and I told God you you have to be my guide I look left and I look right saw a police officer and he begins to walk and he walks just a bit and he comes to a place where a woman has do on her back and brother Bram says good morning Amy good morning Parson how did you know I was a person early this morning and she begins to tell him early this morning I prayed a prayer where's my Elijah at she positionally placed herself in the scriptures she possessionally placed herself in the scriptures with with who she was like I'd be like that shudomite woman and she began to tell brother Branham about her son and brother man said when I walked in there the sign about God over the over the door he's welcome here he's welcome in my home so I walked in he says poor Shanty that's what he called it wouldn't be in derogatory brother Brian was a poor man himself very he said I walked in in the the walls were covered with newspaper I used to be a thing when when you didn't have money it didn't have money for paint you guys have it very well and she plastered her walls with newspapers my brother Brandon for those that want to fight with brother Branham say he was never prayed for King George brother Branham said I've been in four King's castles and I never felt more at home than I did in that house he said he was going oh ooh it's dark in here it's dark in here and he said Annie won't you pray things there's some things that you have to understand as a prophet he knew she called up the storm and if she had the power to call up a storm and the power to get him there she knew how to pray how much power do you have how much power is deposited on the inside of you brother Branham said he prayed for that boy a year later six months to a year later brother Brandon was on that in that part of the country on the railroad and he thought he'd get off and get himself a couple hot dogs and he said he said all of a sudden there was a boy hollering at him brother Brown brother Brown brother and he didn't recognize him he said I'm that boy [Applause] I'm that boy he said I'm a preacher now that boy come walk with me brother Brandon don't get off of that mountain he's going to die in that storm so he has to take the third pull and speak to that storm tell it to go back to where it came from brother Branham said the spirit of the Lord said come walk with me I believe that's what he's asking us to do if I can say anything to you as a pastor of this church let's walk with him the angel would tell brother Branham be more sincere if he needed that how much more do we need that come walk with me now no doubt you too have an accuser of the brethren but we've just heard tonight he can touch your flesh he can touch your spirit but he can't touch that seed he can't touch that seed and God has plans we've heard the message we've had the message at our disposal for all of these years we've been and most of us have been in the message all of our lives that casket that brother Royce Shrewsbury Stood Beside of I was four years old standing beside of that same casket I'm not a Schoolboy when it comes to the message my brother Ed's friend for many many years I cherish that we preached this message around the world and we've projected what God said that there's going to be a bride on the earth there's been churches churches and Brides brides but there must come one we've seen it in China we've seen it in Switzerland we've seen it all over the Earth we've been in many countries and see people with the same heart that you have people with the same desire that you have but we believe that this message is going to change our body and like Enoch he couldn't stay here we can't stay here there's something calling us higher this world don't mean much to us anymore and we're walking to another step [Applause] I finished with this Enoch came to a place he came to a place to where there was a latter provided for him brother Bram says it in several different places like Jacob a ladder to heaven God provided it a bridge God provided it lambskins God provided it God provided this message maybe you won't be here in the morning let me just say this to you when Noah preached and I just delivered this to you when Noah preached he preached the message that could have delivered them but they scoffed it and made fun of it and their unbelief brought on a flood [Music] people don't realize what's going on in the news their unbelief and sin is bringing on the tribulation period if I can say it and put it in words the water that flooded the Earth was the material was the very mature the material of their judgment the bombs that are hanging in Russia that people have made fun of your prophet is going to rain they're going to rain unbelief brought that a man weighed about 150 pounds with an angel with him and a pillar of Fire his message produced this church his message produced our church you guys we just preached our 50th year last year Jubilee our 50th years this year no man did this no man did this brother Frazier was it was inspired of God to do it I was inspired to come here brother Branham didn't do this God did this Enoch left home not realizing I'll not go back because today was the day I experienced something during the fire experience to where that I went brain dead and totally unresponsive and I remember the moments just before I was slipping away and here's some I didn't share this last night but here was some of the thoughts so this is what it's like to die and I felt myself to slip away the rest is history but I'm going to experience and experience one of these days so this is it and I'm going to turn my head and look in the mirror and I'm not going to be white-headed I was turning white-headed but chemo made sure I'd get that way I'm not going to need these anymore these are screwed on but I'm not going to need them no more I don't know where all those things are going to be at me a lot of junk on the ground as far as I know but this message this Bible Brother Ray if I can prophesy to you since there's going to be maybe 40 days we're going to have a youth service here I want to invite you all I want to invite you all and probably we're going to have some special speakers as a matter of fact we're going to take our watch and go I'm not going to need that no more I got Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse on my watch and maybe I'll give this to somebody that really needs it for three and a half years because I'm not going to need this no longer Give the Lord a great big hand this evening respect amen if you enjoyed it a tenth as much as I enjoyed it tonight you've had Church you mind if I just work on it again tomorrow brother Roy shrewsbury's now experiencing what he preached about all of those years by now he shook brother Homer's hand and they've danced a while together he shook brother branham's hand and they've danced a while together brother Ron is that is that really how it is oh yeah my mom looked up in my eyes and she said I'm ready to go and in that moment she went she didn't go to an old decrepit body my mama looks about 18 to 19 years old [Music] she's met your sister [Music] I wouldn't want to call her back to this world not for even a day [Music] brother Ron but

Worlds [Music] I love church I just love church I love to come here [Music] let those Spirits just just go away that it's struggle with you all week things and mind bombs and you come in and the songs
