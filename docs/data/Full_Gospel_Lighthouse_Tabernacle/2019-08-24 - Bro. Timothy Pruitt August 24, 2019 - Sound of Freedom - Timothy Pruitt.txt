weekend and the next weekend come and Lord just you maybe we just sit around your table and feast from your water we pray in Jesus name Amen amen let's turn to Joel chapter 2 it's like I said very much an honor to be here with you with my family I don't know how long it's been it's been about six or seven years ago time time goes by so fast it's hard to keep up with especially as you get older and goes about faster and faster and faster and faster but amen but we came through on our way to some other meetings and we enjoyed herself so much we've been coming every year about this time and I enjoy this time of year up here a man just to be around you and God's God's people or some of the are the most wonderful people in the face of the earth and it's amazing you can go anywhere you can go in Japan China I've been all over the world by God's grace and God's people the same everywhere you go it's his family and it's what a day is going to be when we get to spend time around the table talking about all the things we've been through and the situations and how God pulled us through so many more times and we're thankful for that amen let's just look here at Joel chapter 2 and verse 23 says be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice and the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause us to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and all and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the pommel worm my great army which has sent among you and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that is dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am the midst of Israel and I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hands maids and those days while I pour out my spirit and I'll show wonders in the heavens and the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the Sun shall be turned into darkness a moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord had come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call him the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in the Mount Zion and the Jerusalem shall be deliverance as the Lord has said and the remnant whom the Lord shall call also let's look at revelations chapter 6 and verse 3 said when he had opened the second seal I heard the second beast say come and see and there went out another horse that was red and power was given unto him that set their end to take peace from the earth and they that shall kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and behold and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard the voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou not hurt the old and the wine amen we'll let you be seated this evening amen ain't God good amen he gives us so many blessings so many things we don't even deserve and he's there force every step of the way you know this this sermon came to me just a few moments before service a couple of Wednesday nights ago and and I kind of pushed it away you know you something you you study out something from for a week and sometimes weeks in advance and get ready on the Wednesday night to preach in just a few moments before the service starts here it comes and you just start started putting some things together and I thought no I can't do this so I push delete deleted it all and that was about 6:30 in about 7:10 after the song service started coming here it came again so I've learned one thing you better listen when he talks because you can get in a lot of trouble if you don't him and and and just come to me on the sound of freedom the sound of freedom I believe there is freedom in this hour that we live in I believe there's freedom to the men and women of God who God has come down in such a mighty way in the time if we're living in amen and the darkness is all around the situations and the binding with spirits that are binding people today but there is true freedom amen to the people of God and you know you know we there's something about the presence of God when he comes around you know brother Branham which makes statements he said wherever Jesus comes there's noise it isn't that you make noise to get Jesus to come but when Jesus comes there's noise there's something that takes place or something that moves you at you if you're something first any kind of life on the inside of you when you see life there there's a deep that called 'litham to the deep there has to be a deep to respond him and you know brother Brendan would use this he said one time I was out there preaching he said there was a boy from a certain church that I used to belong to come up and he said Billy you know what he said I was enjoying your message so much until that woman got back there and began screaming and crying and she got them all then people started crying and I said all that that excited you he said why I couldn't hear what you were saying and he said no and I said oh she was just rejoiced and he said ah that just made chills run up and down my back and he said brother branham said brother if you ever get to heaven you'll freeze to death he said because even the angels in heaven is screaming with wings over their face over their feet day and night holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord I said you're living in the quietest world you'll ever live in you're living in the quietest world you ever lived in he said if you go to hell there'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth if you go to heaven there'll be glories and hallelujahs and holy unto the Lord day and night this is the quietest place you've ever will live and he said he happened to play on the Colgate's baseball team you know they ain't he said well you know he said well that they don't do that in my church and I said but I said but I'm brother minister but I hope you don't think your church is the pattern he said well he said well they don't look like very much like a Christian to me when a minister speaking to say a thing like that and I said you know what he said brother Branham said that encourages me he said even when they see a man it means so--but he said I used to have an old dog you know you hear he would take anything but a skunk and I'd get him a tree under the brush pile and anything like that and again you begin to get old French you know what get him I say SiC him boy SiC him boy go get him boy he'd go get him that's the devil is the biggest conk I know of he said when I hear people saying that's right a man we got him treed brother we better get him right now let's go get him now he says he I said look I heard you the other night when Charles Nolan knocked a homerun he said I didn't live very far from the part not over five blocks and so I've never heard so much noise in all my life he said old Billy you ought to Bend there you know it was some kind of deal three men on base and he knocked a homerun he so I'm telling you you oughta seen him slide in the Homebase he said he said I said you a bunch of unholy rollers down there he said I couldn't even sleep because you bunch of unholy rollers he said if we're holy rollers and your unholy rollers he said you would be a poor baseball fiend he said if you'd hit somebody hit a hundred homerun you say well ain't a much to it you know it's just a ball went over a fence he said but if somebody hit a homerun you'd knocks hats off you scream you would shout you'd slap one another he said I said when the preacher gets in the pulpit and he hits a home run and gets after the devil and gets the devil going down the track SiC him boy SiC him begin to shout glory glory hallelujah see heaven is coming down hallelujah heaven is coming down him in another place he says how you feeling everybody feeling God saying man anybody feeling good saying man he said that's good that sounded good he said I like that it means so be it he said I was preaching one time there was a boy that belong to the First Baptist Church when I was a missionary baptist and he said there was some sister really was enjoying herself and got the crying and shouting he was quite a baseball player same guy he said I couldn't do it I said I couldn't take it he said a woman sitting over there shout and got on my nerves as I said all shouldn't do that well yeah he said I just couldn't imagine heaven being like that brother branham said I sure can well it means make shivers running down my back he said if you ever happen to get to heaven it'll freeze you to death if you hear that noise a group uh-huh this is the quietest place you ever live I'll tell you cuz if you go to hell they'll be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth but if you go to heaven there'll be angels that don't stop day or night crying holy holy hallelujah some praise God this is a quiet place this is a quiet place he said I've always been afraid of anything that's quiet he said anything that quiet is dead he said I ain't much for dead things he said anything without emotion is dead what anything without emotion is dead sold for your experience hasn't got a little noise to it or a little emotion to it you better bury it and get something else that's got some life in it hallelujah Amen that's one thing I don't want anybody to blame me for being his dead hallelujah you say well I don't know you know is there's a lot of work up you know brother Brandon would say this and I think this was pretty profound because he used something so simple about about explaining how somebody can realize the presence of God is near and the next person don't even know it's anything's happening he said as possible you can be sitting here he said everyone of us has got the same sense that see taste smell feeling here he said you can have such a headache that you couldn't sit still and I wouldn't have one how do I know you have a headache it's something individual with you and he said how the Spirit of God can come down into a group of people and can baptize a person in such a way that the power of God cares them till they don't even know where they're at anymore and the next person sit right next to them and know nothing about it listen I don't ever want to get in that condition when the Spirit of God can fall down the pewte next to me and I'd not know anything about it I want to know something is going on that God is in the midst of his people I don't want to ever be in the service when the power of God it's sweeping through the building and I don't realize it I don't know it I don't feel it I don't understand it I want to know every time he comes hallelujah God make us cognate of his presence he comes every service but sometimes he's biased before he realized these came in his wind there was so many that watched him as he walked down the streets of Jerusalem or the streets of Samaria and they missed him when he come by and they didn't recognize him when he came by I don't want to be in that group I want to be the one who recognized this is my moment this is my time this is my service this is my time with the king of King this is my moment with him I I have a I have an opportunity to be with him how many others who was there when the woman touched the hem of His garment but they didn't recognize him they thought I was just some old fogies just some old preacher somewhere somebody he's made him out stephane job we know who he really is he's just the son of Joseph and Mary trying to make himself to me but this woman said this is my moment hallelujah listen this weekend then this service even tonight and he's coming up you ought to take care of her services this is my moment this is my time to have a hug a moment with the conference with God this is my time to hear directly from him the doctor was talking about the Brenham he says you know he said don't you think them people just get a little excited he just to be excited no sir said well that's just nervousness there's something that causes them to scream and holler and go home as a doctor you mean to tell me that nerves can be excited without something to excite them something has to excite them what is it he said so what's there he said I said it's the unseen force of the Holy Ghost moving among us it excites that born-again spirit it brings an excitement to that spirit the power of God moving down and faith began to stir the only ghost takes the word and begins to take it to the people to catch it with a power that regenerated borning in life something has to cry out something has to cry out but as we read y'all seen the day coming he's and are in her opening scripture here let's look back at he says be glad then he children of Zion and rejoicing the Lord your God for his giving you the former reigning he calls that the former in the latter rain but the floors shall be full of wheat that gives me confidence right there hey man the devil may do all he wants to do and he may try to make this will stop and this one quit that one deny the message and this will walk away but at the scripture the prophecy of Joel said the floor will be full of wheat hey man and the fat shall overflow with wine and oh he meant wine the stimulation of Revelation amen amen I love how he goes on down he said it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh now we know what happened on the day of Pentecost in the but upper room they were gathering the upper room they got in one mind and one Accord they began to sit aside themselves and begin to realize their thoughts of what they thought it was going to be and how they thought it was going to happen and how they would have done it or where they would have had the meeting or where they would have had the building what will mate with all what they would have done they put it on the side and they said we want to hear from Jesus he promised us going tarry in Jerusalem and I'll send you power from on high we put aside what we want what we think what we decide how we would do it how we would operate what we want food we would serve what we would do we're gonna put it all aside and we gonna get in one mind and one accord and then is not mine or not our walks it is the mind of Christ hallelujah and the Spirit of God came through as a rushing mighty wind I want you to understand it wasn't just something to made your hair fluffle a little bit this Russian it was an outpour draft is what his Bible says it was an upper draft it was bearing up their burdens and this rushing mighty this mighty means violent hallelujah Brandon would say he loves to bring a bulldozer down your tin can alley things you think are so important how you think it ought to be next thing you know all that stuff splattering here and going there and he's building the Hallelujah Avenue hey man he's building your road he's building you places it's a violent it's a and the wind is a breath of life so it's a it's bringing you up violently hey man it wasn't just loose it was some noise going on he got to be so much noise in that room to where they spilled out into the streets and people begin to say well is he being drunk are they drunk is something wrong here what's going on in any member and Peter says no we're not drunk that's all in a third hour of the day they ain't drinking time amen we're not drunk as you suppose or on some natural drink or some Budweiser or wine somewhere we're not drunk on that we're drunk on a new wine hallelujah I believe God still got a people who knows how to drink a man knows how to drink knows how to drink in the spirit knows how to drink in the move of God so God can come and wash it all away amen if you don't care let's get drunk that's going a good drunk this weekend amen but it's possible the some can sit there and the power of God moving and then some others not even know nothing about it we got that going on in this day you know people coming along with this new way of worship you know and how you're supposed to know their ideas of how worship out of being you know and they don't like you to get too excited don't like you to get too emotional yeah you know I was I would say yeah I was thinking about that one day as I was driving actually when we came through here we came through here for the my father-in-law's funeral there and we came to spoke that Sunday night spoke on the the power of praise I was driving home and I was thinking about that and I got to thinking again about David and how because you know we've we've been criticized for our music and criticized for things you know you do anything right you're going to get criticized but and so I just kind of was burdened me because me as a song leader you don't want to do wrong but I mean you want to be have freedom you want to be able to worship God I I don't need no rules and regulations on how to worship God but I was thinking about David and it just struck me again you know about how a brother branham talking about how you dance at the return of the art that probably wasn't a very quiet little service I don't think I don't think that was very quiet no but there was somebody that began to look on him and despise him you know I know I met anyone looked at that I realize you know it wasn't the Philistines marking him it wasn't malachite smoking him it was his own people but what did God do God shut up the womb where they wouldn't bring up brief she couldn't bring forth fruit nor Adam said and David said you don't like that watch this and the power of God coming my Bruma in that cars I'm driving down the road and he spoke to me he said if they didn't like this year what they didn't like last year watch this here [Applause] hallelujah if they didn't like last service watch this service hallelujah I'm expecting more of God more healings more deliverances more miracles more visions I'm expecting more of the supernatural the God he says god help today when we come and adopt a theology instead of the baptism of the Holy Spirit God helped the day when we take in tithing from the church and bold up some old tough rooster and solder for 50 cents on the plate to get enough money to pay the preacher god help the day when we substituted the upper room for a supper ooh god help the day when we've taken an old-fashioned st. Paul revival in the Bible Holy Ghost preached and his power and simplicity and traded it for a bunch of theology long ago he said I was thinking I was who I was up in Canada was riding to a night I've been back about 40 or 50 miles thousands of miles from the hardtop road back there hunting and I was riding through the moonlight and I came to a big old barn over it was a great bunch of big old tall stately pines and the moon was shining on them looked like a graveyard a spooky looking place and he said there came a wind down through there and the wind beginning to hit them and they go I've been there I was actually up on them not not in this location here but I was on Mount Lemmon with brother Doug Baker and that had a fire up there and he took me on top it's a couple of years after the fire and there was he snags you don't stick it out we sat on the side and overlooked in the Tucson Valley down there and the wind began to blow man them trees begin to make noises and it wasn't I couldn't man I was there in the daylight I could imagine being the moonlight I always said I'm not afraid of the dark I'm afraid of the things in the dark yeah hey man yeah just the most mournful sound you ever heard in your life and he said I looked at that a bit in those trees he said but those trees put me in mind of some of the great big fines fired churches standing but just as dead as a doornail he said the Palmer worms eat all the bark off of them hey man you know what the bark is is the covering of the tree I believe his brother Donnie he said it like this he said you sisters need to watch out the palm worms get in your bark some things are just worth repeating ain't a man that goes for the men nowadays lord have mercy man how did I get there anyway fired that trials have blazed all the spirit away from there's nothing left but a great big statue but just as dead as can be and he said when the rushing mighty wind comes from heaven the only thing they can do is groan and carry on and hardly know anything is going on if say days of miracles are pass it'll say only God send visions our brother branham they'll say only God did things like that 50 years ago we don't have services like that no more what the pom worm left the caterpillar eating he said what the Methodists left the Baptist seen what the babbles left the Presbyterian is they listen listen it's nothing but the truth we we brother brother Ron's been there we had our family camp over in Scottsville Texas he was there the first one wasn't you were that every one of them I don't know if y'all know this we love that guy so if y'all get rid of we got a place for him all right but anyway actually I believe it was Buddy Robinson that preached at this camp but we had our first camp and it was a some of the camper people that work there they were Nazarene came to the front of the some of the services and then one man just said they were tears running down his face they come and told her one of our deacons later he says we used to have services just like you have we used to have worship like you got it he said well we've lost it and let me tell you that Palmer worm and Caterpillar and all that for stages is still at work and it's eating in the message ranks critical spirits are rising up and and trying to squash the real moving of the Holy Ghost you know I got to thinking of how brother Branham you know does it get you prepared brother Branham says that he said tell us a story several times and I love it just look one of my favorite stories he tells one place he said he was doing a teaching on the second coming of the Lord he said I was teaching about four hours four hours that goes throughout some of you 30 minute 45 minute you know see OD people for hours he said we have the thought I'd give the people a break so I did a little halftime and they say you know somebody started playing the piano and another one started beating on a washboard and one place he says I thought they was gonna turn my church into a tavern and he's there dancing in things and he's just not me but what one place he says and it just struck me so deeply he said I was back there and you know I was looking and I was watching all that take place he said but I wouldn't say anything he said because I was afraid they might be right and I might be wrong if a prophet can have that kind of attitude why can't we have the same attitude we're so we're so quick to just a lot of opinions and won't wait they listen it's just our opinion hey man but he said that woman he said I believe it she'd have had four rows of keys should have played every one of them that's the kind of piano playing I like and he said that well the one we got there to play in that thimble and I watched bored and the other one got to dancing and he said I was looking there and he's like I was wondering about it you know about this and he said I was in the seat of the scornful and he was kind of looking at his scorning in it and thinking they're turning his church in the tavern and he but he said I begin to think maybe you know what fundamentalist don't know everything Wow and he said you know I I got to looking at that I got to pondering it what where is dancing in the Bible and he said I got to remember Miriam Miriam on one side was running for her life on the other side of the river on the other side of the Dead Sea she was dancing and rejoicing and praising God because all of her test master was dead he reckoned that was a sound of freedom you reckon that was a quite service no something coming on the inside he can't hit me no more he came by me no more he can't make me make one more throw one more break he can't make me serve not one more day hallo they began to sing a new song hallelujah the brother who said about that time my miss and his foot got to tap it a little bit he said then I got some thinking about David when he saw the word being restored is that not what we have witnessed in this day the word has been brought back in his full power fall Holy Ghost fall healings food deliverances fall freedom you don't have to stay in your cell deny the doors are open all you got to do is walk out of there and say I'm delivered I'm free next thing you know he said he was up there dancing with her he said I ain't never done that before he said but I think it did a pretty good job hey man I don't know you but he says you know what one left the other eat til there's got nothing but big a big dead tree we see him nowadays I was building we're building a new building there at the church and we went to look this guy that was actually putting the building up he told us about another one had another Church he had put up so we went to look at his work and kind of get some ideas and so this lady was over the the buildings and things opened the door for us and she said where y'all from we told her we'd was just down the road there at the new church and she so I watch to come up and wow this is wonderful how many how many people comes on a Sunday and say well I don't know about 200 250 probably maybe a little more some give or take you see I've got any young people I said yeah we got about 40 or 50 young people and that's certain ages and then in our Sunday School there's about another 50 or 60 feet young kids she just looked at me just stared at me she said what kind of program do y'all have I said it's the oldest program in the Bible it's called repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a Word of God that's keeping them young people not some not some program or some dinner or this or that there we preach the Word of God but the Palmer worms and all these they're in it these insects have stripped the power away but there is a promise I will restore hello he said I happened he said I happen to look that night that wind was blowing through how stiff and starchy and dead they were sitting there moaning and groaning then have no life to bend with it no bark on it and make it flexible just sitting there moaning and groaning only count of the wind I thought my but I happened to notice down underneath there was some undergrowth coming up some little bushes about like that they had life in them and when that wind began to hit them they begin twisting and ringing and shouting and having a glorious time he said let me tell you brother God's going to raise up a generation of people out of all this dead stuff that's going to restore saith the Lord God is going to raise up people who believe in signs and wonders God's going to raise up people who's got joy unspeakable and full of glory God's gonna raise up people that I believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and when that rushing mighty wind comes it just gives right into it and frolics and dances and glorifies God Greenleaf's clapping their hands and having a wonderful time what a frolic little under ruthless habit but that big old tree standing that moanin and groanin same wind same wind the same one with the same way was making one moan and groan was the same with that the other was given the other a good time maybe you've been a Mona and groaner maybe been murmuring and complaining but there is a promise I will restore you don't have to stay there amen the same win hallelujah then we going down he said think you know I'm crazy but I'm happy this way Amen same here tonight let me tell you brother yes indeed if there ever was a time we need to get going this today said I think about the time when Moses back there was talking I was talking to him the other night when God said wait you say well wait till I get ready he said when God called Moses he didn't have nothing but his hand a stick what's in your hand God sinned he said a stick he said take that how am I gonna whip this army what do you got in your hand a stick take that and go down whatever snare you pick it up and go home and away when Moses went there one man invasion to go take over Egypt with a stick in his hand God told him take what he had listened it was the greatest sound of freedom in 400 years as began to sound out let my people go let my people go and Moses you looked emotion you thought emotion what you done lost your mind he said act you're exactly right I tried with my whole mind to try to to try to set them free and all I can do is produce more than that Egyptian but I met a pillar of fire on the backside of it desert it was a rushing mighty win and listen if you could see in the other realms about Moses was that same pillar of fire it was well and over Moses as he walked towards Egypt it was a sound of freedom let my people go may that sound go forth tonight you don't have to stay bound you don't have to say depressed you don't have to stay bound with depression or fear there is a power that says let my people go there is a sound of freedom Alleluia there is a word here that has been brought that's not for your defeat or Europe did your demise this word is for your victory hallelujah he meant sometimes the sound comes in many different avenues and many different ways it was Samson one time sitting up there minding his own business and here devil come with a thousand of his amps come to surround him but there was a sound of freedom there laying in the looking like a jawbone let me tell you that devil is about he's an idiot I don't know about you but just for me I'm just you know I may not be the smartest cookie but if I seen a guy pick up a job on and about the fifth person he hit and they fell over dead I'm out go I'm out because I realized something's behind that that's greater than their jawbone that's greater than that man swinging that Joe ball but the devil is a dumb devil he'll stay around till he's utterly defeated hallelujah just like you did when they was chasing after the children of Israel after God had decimated Hillman and showed him who was God he was dumb enough to get on his horse and ride down to the Red Sea and God said I've been waiting for this moment I created the mountains I created that see I placed this before the foundation of the world I had it in my mind not for my children's demise or defeat before the devil's defeat I want you to understand the agent we're living in it's not for your demise it's not for your defeat this atmosphere has been created then all hell will be loose in oh hell we'll be defeated he's brought him down and say come home bring your horses come out of the Year river euphrates thousand times thousands been released all kinds of things sickness of every kind tormenting spirits of every kind have been brought here for they're burning another one I'm just show you how dumb the devil is Shamgar jumps out of the window with our ox goad go stick with a little knob on the end of it and goes to whoopings five six hundred four listings for listing must be Spanish for stupid because both these stores was felicitated incredible it would have took

had been there 40 days come out he's I'll I'm going to just go out and I'm gonna go out and make my challenge it was the last day he pushed his breakfast back it was the last day he put his armor on it was the last day he got up and he began to walk down that hill this was his last day you looked at devil and I say this is your last day hey this is your last day live rather said - he had a meeting one time and said there's a crippled boy that came here was prayed for many of you was there to see him they brought him back in the emergency room Billy led him to me they had him on the platform for three or four nights there in the building he didn't get a prayer card so they put him in the emergency room I went there and prayed for him looked at and he said brother branham can you tell me some consolation I said yes sir son polio got you this way he said that's right your name is such-and-such he came from a certain place that's right what about my healing I said by his stripes you were healed hello somebody he just told him what the word said by your stripes you were healed he went home testifying giving God praise he brought such a reproach they claimed in the neighborhood until one Sunday a group of ministers came in and set down by him and said you must stop doing that you're bringing a reproach upon the calls and the young man sitting there said mister if you were sitting where I am if he was in the chair I'm sitting in you wouldn't try to rob me of the last hope I've gotten cries by His stripes I'm healed hallelujah can anybody else say that tonight by His stripes I'm healed and no more sitting like this sitting there paralyzed hands body and back nobody said that out of his cherry Wynn glorifying God you talking about a sound Alfredo glory to God in the highest if we can begin to speak the word by His stripes I'm healed I am delivered I am set free hallelujah just go ahead and celebrate your freedom for a moment by his strives I'm held it's casting away anything contrary to what God said hallelujah I know we get to act a little crazy but it's just the sounds of freedom you may have heard this story but it's worth telling again it was some P Amanda's bought this real estate down in Pensacola Florida and he gonna build some houses only people laughed at him because it was by Air Force Base so nobody's gonna live there but he went ahead and went with his plan started building houses selling them for a lot of money people moved in there from everywhere you know just moving next thing you know these Jets wake up and then they're their glasses on their dinner table wood and rumbling I couldn't sit out and drink their iced tea on the porch so you got this causing a stir you know what the City Hall and is like you know we can't even get no rest these jets wouldn't we need to we need to you know do something about this change their flight plan something and the City Hall come back and said well you knew that there was an Air Force Base there when you bought the house but they just call such a stir to where they got a sign down there now pointy right out that neighborhood and I wouldn't care if we put one up this weekend pointed right at that neighborhood and says pardon the noise it's just the sound of freedom [Applause] [Laughter] hallelujah somebody wants to criticize and make fun and act like it with a bunch of holy rollers card the Nords it's just the sound of freedom right there with some healer well I'm not there with some deliverance lower the car right there with the Holy Ghost to set another captive free pardon the noise hallelujah don't be a shame the Bible we read my people will never be a shame we don't have to be ashamed of our music we don't have to be ashamed of our saying we don't have to be ashamed of my worship he's worthy of worship he's one of their praise he's one of their glory hallelujah when Jesus comes there's always noise there's something on something the inside of a believer says this my lord that's my god that's my king that's my everything that's my own and all you know they said it was a prophet one time getting such a stew because you know I believe it was Ahab when one of the wicked King came up and he said he said if Jehoshaphat wasn't here I wouldn't even speak to you got our anger about it you said what in the world was the Prophet getting angry for how can that happen but he's he couldn't hear from nothing from God so he said bring me a minstrel so he brought him a minstrel he said well brother Branham I'm not the Prophet he's over you ain't the Prophet you can be an instrument he said if all you can do is give vent to them ten strains give vent to them just as hard as you can instead if you can't be the Prophet be part of the minstrels but do something to bring the spirit of the Lord down I want to be guilty of bringing the Spirit of the Lord down the Prophet can't do it all himself he had to have a minstrel to help him then when you see every said when the Prophet and the people got in harmony with God then the Prophet began to see things he said brother if you don't see divine healing if you don't see the baptism the Holy Ghost if you don't see that mighty move of the Spirit of God moving the last stage here just getting the spirit one time and you'll see things will be revealed to you then you'll begin to notice things are looked a little different and you won't go along with that criticizing spirit oh man now this let's cut the tape for a moment this is all free but I know how it is in a meeting a meeting comes the devil tries to bring every kind of critical thing in hey I know I've been there I fought I had to fight it had to deal with it had to let's lay it all aside lay it all aside it ain't just our opinions how something should be done or shouldn't be it's just our opinions but brother Daniel Williams he's going on to be the Lord he had a wonderful statement he said everybody has opinion just like they got noses it just we all got him I got him I go to the church yeah I see things I wouldn't do if it was my church but I don't mean I have to say it alright now we roll the tape again yeah well I do okay yeah but you know he says that a prophet seen a vision after the Spirit of God began to move and freedom of getting to move back in the camp again he saw a vision he said you're not gonna see rain here win but there's going to be water to come but you've got something to do dig the ditches and I want you to understand you may not be the preacher you may not be the minstrels up here part of the piano player this that and the other but we all got a part to play if you want something from God dig the ditch you say you say well that's a hard thing you know that's the below my pay scale you know a ditch diggings rough that's below what I want to do yes that's not who I am if you want something from God dig the ditch that goes for every one of us what is it huh Isaac teaching you to have the Hermit to him to become humility and to get yourself down into the dirt where you came from it start digging out the trenches you want to bless them from God this weekend have your ditches ready that means if there's something there you dig in and you find something good you know what that is that's an old TV oh I have you - no it's not a TV it's monitors and we have Netflix and we do well let me just tell you something this is for free was dealing with a situation at home with a young lady she fell out under a demonic power and she heard her daddy got involved there right off the bat and began to challenge the devil you know the devil did begin to speak in a voice it was not hers it says you're nothing but a fake all you're gonna do is go back to your TV give the man credit he jumped me jump back threw his hands up in front of everybody's a hundred people there said it's the truth I've allowed Hulu TV or something I don't know some kind of you know we it's kind of like they say you know we wouldn't go to the movies but the devil pulled the wool over our eyes and it just keeps getting the wool keeps getting changed well I don't have no antenna I don't have satellite but we got Internet we bring all this mess into our homes and we wonder why we're not getting the blessing of God dig the ditch whatever it is if it's a critical spirit dig it out if it's bitterness just think the time to hold bitterness if you want something from God you can't come with a bitterness in your heart towards a brother or anybody it don't matter if it's your wife husband pastor this and the other if it's a neighbor down the road you can't have it in you you got to dig it out if you want that to be filled with the waters of God you had to get it's a struggle God so remember the more they dug the more water they got hit a snag throw that snag out lots of times your digging you hit the neighbor the lives next door keep digging sometimes you hit your pastor along the lines just keep digging dig dig dig he said we will but one thing for sure we don't want nothing shallow I mean notice what he did without my goodness time flying when you have him fun you notice what he did with a woman at the whale she walked in there with her water book the scripture says she had her waterpot and he comes and said tells her to give him a drink into you she says and she and then he tells her I can give you a drink that you'll not thirst again she says huh you don't have a waterpot I got a waterpot but as the scripture progresses and she begins to see this ain't just a man talking to her it's ain't just a prophet talking to her this is God talking to me the scripture says and she ran into she left her waterpot what she came think it was so important wasn't so important no more when you meet Jesus you'll find out a lot of things ain't so important anymore hey man that was for free to keep on diggin get a great big deep ditch because what was he doing the woman at the well he's taking it from the surface my water pot to the dips the more ditch you dig the more water you get the more water you get the more happiness and joy and things of God you can receive he said well whatever to get dig the ditches and get all the world out of the way get all those picture shows and hoe downs and things you're tending to and let all that go and let the waters come in give God first place get those things straightened out then first thing you know the old stale bait the enemy a look and say I believe it had a slaughter down there looks like blood and they rose and came and God set up an ambush against him hallelujah and beat them all the way to the wall and they burnt every city they stopped every well why because they started digging ditches hallelujah we want the victory but do we want to dig the ditch we want the freedom but we got to start digging it out of our lives hallelujah all as we read in the the third seal would bring this down really quick all typifies the Holy Spirit wine simile symbolizes stimulation of Revelation he said brother Branham said when I was seeing that I like to run all over the place I stopped up a lot of old stagnated Wells right there listen said they took it and that's great that scripture they took rocks brother Branham said that was a rock of testimony don't ever be ashamed of your testimony because that testimony was shut the devil's mouth up because you know we were like I said we've been criticized by our music and things and whatever but it was amazing to me that during some music one day was this little woman dried up to about 90 pounds sitting back there in the back in our mezzanine seating cancer and her all lay up in her lungs wasn't just just dying she'll be here this next weekend that'll shut the devil's mouth up and here in all this worldly music you know this woman gets under the influence of the Holy Ghost couldn't hardly even stand weak under the the doctor says that told her its total later said I thought the medicine with the treatments was gonna kill you because she was down to nothing but the power of God fell on her as we begin to sing my father standing at the pulpit out of her seat she got to begin to run around the building it's weak 90-pound woman beginning to run around the building praising God sister Atlanta but the next day she goes to the doctor and they do another scan and every sign of cancer is gone hallelujah Lord of heart he said I like to ran around the building when I heard that the Holy Ghost stimulates you it's a stimulation of Revelation you can't get one without getting the other it's all and the wine and listen why would he tell him don't hurt it holding one of the Bible's socially associated together always he said when the truth of a promised Word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with all oh yeah they get all stimulated why in his stimulation he said glory I feel it right now stimulated with joy and shouts and hallelujah he said what it does it has the same effect on them that wine has upon a natural man he said because when the revelation has been given of the truth of God the true believer filled with all the revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes them behave himself on normally in other words you don't no longer make the normal list you know my brother-in-law Aaron you know brother Aaron he's preached hearing me my other brother all Jeff they had this joke about you know they had a normal list and you know there was the only two people that can make the normal list and now that Aaron's become a preacher hearing on the normal list when you get filled with this Holy Ghost you ain't no more on the normal is you're not a normal person you don't have a normal service you don't have a normal day you don't have a normal moment of your life when that Holy Ghost falls on the inside of you and it begins to stimulate you you behave yourself are normally he said that's right maybe that's what's the matter with them now that's right it makes them behave themselves on seemingly so you're not normal and you don't seem to be in your right mind you've lost yourself you've lost who you thought you was going to be all the plans that you had made all the things you had prepared but all God had something else for you hallelujah listen let me tell you this didn't only mess up your friends it messed up the devil's plans the devil had plans for you to be a prostitute or a drunk out on the streets or some drug dealer or something else somewhere or some businessman but God messed up his plans hallelujah and you're not normal no more why because of something on the inside we need to have a sign up here this next weekend says we ain't normal hit if you are you probably not won't feel comfortable just the sounds of freedom I can hear those bombers loading up right now the devil is gonna have a bad day you know them boys used to when they went in fall time I remember you know 91 or whatever it was when our big Wars we had the Operation Desert Storm they'd write on them bombs hi Saddam this one's for you Saddam there's some bonds being wrote on right now depression this was for you sugar diabetes this was for you high blood pressure this is for you cancer here's your bomb anxiety this one's for you torment spirit this was for you there's bombs being loaded up ladies a guided missile then nobody knows how to drop them in the road and the Holy Ghost when sounds our freedom begin to take place and he does a flyover over the building something's gonna take place hell's gonna blow up an hey man listen this right here he says a strange thing but everywhere God is there seems to be a lot of noise he said in Isaiah was in the temple he said he heard a noise and the whole temple was shaking the posts were moving out of their place angels and serums and cherubims burners of the sacrifice given the repent of the right of the altar those are great beings beyond the Angels with their wings over the faces their feet flying shaking the tabernacle screaming holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty he said wherever Jesus is there's always a lot of noise he entered the temple one day and they broke down palms and screamed and shouted and he said those great professors of society priests make them hold their peace he said if they hold their peace of rocks will cry out I'm gonna tell you they drop gonna take my place as long as I'm alive to glorify the King of Kings I'm going to give him praise you're not taking my place I've got my own place to worship you to glorify Him [Applause] hallelujah second Peter 3 and verse 10 he said listening this not only is it a lot of noise now is gonna be a lot of noise when this earth burns he said the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night so it sounded like to me God don't really like it quite he likes a lot of noise in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth also and the works that are in it therein shall be burned up now remember as I told you he invited that the Egyptian army right down to their death the river Euphrates has been opened up in this day and every thousands time thousands have been invited into this place thinking thinking they was going to defeat the purpose of God it's a trick said heavens and earth is in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom he said heavens and earth will pass away with a great noise did you notice here heavens will pass away with a great noise the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the glasses that's in the earth and explode it the Bible says the heavens are pass away with a great noise such an explosion will rock it oh my cause it will kill every disease Oh hallelujah don't you Kate you hear it now the screams of cancer the screams of sugar diabetes the screams of fear and unbelief and the spirits and the haunts of hell as the powers of God begin to be unleashed upon this earth and you talk about popping and power and screaming have you ever thought about cancer giving his last scream last days hallelujah he said everything that has been done the fire would burn it up every disease every thistle every thorn everything that devil has ever done to you it is going to burn with fire remember it's not just a literal fire it's a holy fire they don't take away Satan and all the devil's whoa what a time that's gonna be you think you've been tormented by cancer you've been tormented by fear you've been tormented by a spirits of unbelief and spirits of doubt what about the torment they're about to receive when this holy fire of God is unleashed and it begins to burn out dross burn out thistles burn out disease he said you think a little noise out here in Tucson was something when he opened up the seals and shook the country and calls the talk wait till this earth receives her baptism demons will be howling screaming and running for the life he said there's going to be a lot of noise and hear them scream and shout just wait to this earth gets her baptism the water will explode change the whole earth those that said change the whole surface of the earth she'll burst and blow to pieces all the outside the crust a hundred feet below will just be simply demolished the atmosphere and the gases are finding these missiles they can't get through it great sphere here way up into there they'll burst the holy wrath of God will come upon it and cleanse it of everything we'll chain you talking about the sound of freedom when this earth goes back to what she was supposed to be back to a Garden of Eden again back to perfect peace back to perfect hell back to perfect everything many of you that want to put down the word and Greek word pass away it comes he said how I said but how is this word going to pass away and we're gonna live on it he said notice he said has struck me I can't even pronounce the word but he said the Lord struck me said heavens and earth pass away says passing from one form to another it does not mean anihilation it means passing from one form to another the same is what you did you pass from one form a drunkard a dub head whatever he was sinner religious demon whatever it was and the powers of God begin the world over you and that holy fire burnt within you there was a lot of noise and you pass from one form to another I'm so glad he didn't throw the clay away he could have but he just restarted and remoulded the same he's going to do with this earth passing from one form to another the sound of freedom may freedom ring this weekend may freedom ring with everything that has got we can read the story as we close brother Brennan would tell Arnold bond Rico did hear the country wasn't hopeless and is surrounded on every side seem elated about to go down in defeat their families would be killed her homes would be lost their motherland destroyed nothing they could do it was hopeless but the sound of freedom sounded in a man about this tall and he said my brother this day I give my life for Switzerland what will you do he says down in the valley my little wife my children waited for me to come home but they won't see me again what do you want to do he said everyone who's got weapons follow me and do the best you can do everything you can with what you got with and he screamed as he threw up his weapon make way for liberty make way for liberty and he began to scream as he ran down to the thickest spears and he grabbed him and pulled him into his chance and said make way for liberty it was such a sound of freedom that is so energized of forces around them till they drove the army out of their pit bail them out of the country and they've never had a war since that day he said you think that was something he said I remember when the when Adam came down and he said I this day I give my life for my people make way for Liberty Magway for Liberty he went to the thickest of spears he went to the valley of the shadow of death and he grabbed every dart of the devil and he pulled it into his bosom and calls the church to say come on go with what you got praise God and he said on the day of Pentecost a rushing mighty wind fell out of heaven and armed every man with a weapon and he said whatever you got today break through the enemy's lines go as hard as you got with everything that you got make way for liberty make way for liberty he said this great warrior Christ has broke his way and he's put the enemy to the run he's put the enemy to run it is the scream of Jubilee it is an hour of Jubilee you don't have to serve the devil not one more day five more minutes is too long with the devil three more seconds is too long with the devil all you got to do tonight is throw that hoe down and say I'm not serving you not one more minute I'm going to serve the King of Kings and the Lord of lords make way for Liberty hallelujah as you hear those fighter jets in this day scream across these mountains I was over in Israel got the chance to go over there and see some of the things in the sights some wonderful moments but you hear those Jets screaming across sad now in Israel is not a very big country don't take very long to get across in the fighter jet but there was something about Israel we went to this one little place it was a little glass museum and there was this got done all kind of art out of glass and some some incredible sculptures but in this one room was the most ugliest hideous sculpture you ever seen in your life and it was representing the Holocaust and now Jewish woman stood there she gave us a tour she'd this said this right here says never forgive never forget and that's their cry today never forgive never forget why because they hadn't the head they don't know that Jesus we know they don't understand why it's all about what's why it happened the way it happened but it puts such a resolve to them that says they'll never be another Holocaust we'll never go to another death chamber will never walk down those streets to that gas chamber and give our lives of free we're gonna fight and they have gathered up every kind of technology whatever they can do and just daring somebody to do something they're ready they're ready for the moment they said but whatever we'll never go back when those men took those Jets here and flew them into the World Trade Center they couldn't do it again ain't gonna happen again no no they think will happen again because why there's gonna be somebody on them Jets when some guy stands up and says I'm gonna blow up something or I'm on there gonna be a whole group of guys jump on him guarantee you we ain't going back to that and it's time that we realized we're not going back to that we're not going back to cold dead formulism we're not going back to days pass and miracles of the past and signs and wonders are passed there's no more prophecies and no more if we're not going back to that if you want to go go ahead I ain't going but I will never go back because I've been given the greatest weapon that's ever been given to man it's the Holy Ghost it's the sounds of freedom may they ring this coming week may freedom blow through this place service after service after service I wonder if it can blow tonight I wonder if ever be one person in here and says you know what I'm not gonna serve the devil not one more minute I'm throwing my ho down I'm throwing my fear down I'm throwing my riot my my dad without that thing that's been pop bothering me in my past I'm leaving it behind I'm going on with Jesus I'm going through Jesus I'm going through I will never go back I wonder how many say I'll never go back I ain't going back to the drug head and then oh think of the world in the past map I'm not going back I'm going forward I'm going with Jesus I'm going with everything that I've got I am going through this is the hour of Jubilee this is the hour of your freedom your healer your deliverance your salvation whatever you have need of the Jubilee trumpet is sounding when you hear those fighter jets blow through it puts me in mind of the thoughts of the roar escaping from our mighty line of Judah the bearer of our freedoms the heavens shook with his power upon the cross Jesus cried and the scripture said with a loud voice and He healed it up his spirit then the veil of the temple was torn and the earthquake and the rocks were split and the graves were opened up why why did he die for us why does the powerful roar of the line of Judas shake the earth upon his the he roared to break chains he roared to sent captives free he roared the changes of spare and chains of fear and chains of sickness and sorrow that separated us from a holy God would be broke and he's rolling tonight can you hear the roar can you hear the sound of freedom echoing across the hills of glory he's here for your deliverance let's power it every chain is broken you don't have to stay in that prison the bars have been tore apart your prison doors open walk out and claim your god-given right let the sounds of freedom freedom deliverance freedom they seen a message of bondage this is a message of freedom this message is not my prison it's my castle it's my defense it's my protection I wonder how many just
