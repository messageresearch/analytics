here Sunday morning so just be remembering that in your prayers and traveling there also want to continue to remember our pastor brother Andrew there as he's speaking this morning as we prayed about there that God would just bless them I know they'll enjoy that won't they amen we certainly enjoy him and I enjoyed brother William last night amen amen if you missed it go back and listen to it that was great that's the message that's the message right there amen maybe this morning we'll turn uh first to Isaiah 41 and verse 10 thank you musician sorry about that this morning I'd like to speak on leadership and uh I'd like to take it from a subject of Nehemiah this morning and so as we go about this I'm going to build a little bit of a foundation I know we're going to be building a wall so we're to build a foundation first and I don't mean to take away from Andrew's sermons of Jericho about building walls he's been turning them down we're going to build them I I'm not trying to do that or take away from what he's been preaching there so so don't think that I'm trying to combat what he's been doing here so so this morning it'll be uh leadership amen so Isaiah 41 and10 it says fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee yay I will uphold thee in with the right hand of my righteousness and maybe we'll turn to Psalms 37 and verse 5 if they could just put it up there on the board for you you can read it there says commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass so for us to be led we must have a god he's our God this morning isn't he amen you can be seated at this time pray for the blessings of the word of the Lord this morning so as we go about leadership this morning I want to just uh as i s said build a foundation on where I want to go here but leadership is about building trust creating a shared vision and rallying people around a common purpose it's about recognizing the strengths of each individual and leveraging them to achieve Collective success amen that's a little bit of a leadership there you know it's not all about one person it's about helping people find their purpose to find a successful solution leadership is also termed as influence if you have leadership you have influence so what is influence there's good and bad influence and in a day and age of social media there is a lot of influence not all of it's good influence everybody wants to be an influencer but they don't want to lead you in the correct way amen so you must watch your leadership who you are following because we are all following someone to a certain purpose so make it Christ amen that's right amen so with Nehemiah to be to go where we'd like to go this morning I want to just we want to recognize the purpose of the wall being built now Nehemiah building the wall God just didn't just want walls you know if God wanted walls he can just say walls be built but we want to find the purpose of Nehemiah here why was there need of walls so we look to Daniel and verse 9 this morning and verse one and it says in verse one in the first year of Darius the son of aus the seed of the mes which was made King over the realm of the Cal Chaldeans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by the books of the number of years where whereof the number where whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet see he looked to see what Jeremiah had prophesied so but he understood what Jeremiah had prophesied here he went to the books he had to have an understanding of what he had prophesied and said the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years years of the desolation of Jerusalem so we see that the Jews had been cast out they had been destroyed they had pushed out scattered abroad and Jeremiah was saying that it would be 70 years in Desolation then we go down to Daniel in verse 20 and Daniel here says while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of My People Israel and presenting the supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel Angel Gabriel came unto him and if you would like to go back and review where I'm getting a lot of this this morning go to Gabriel's instruction brother brandham speaking that and this is where brother brandham will tell about all these things and what we are talking about this morning and helps you understand the 70 and 70 weeks said while I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in a vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill an understanding okay so we see he is in prayer and Gabriel's come to him to help him understand what he has read of Jeremiah the prophet here and says excuse me I lost my place and the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth and I come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks now understand this 70 weeks are determined upon thy people thy people meaning the Jews amen not the Gentiles it is the Jews in in this that we're talking of because they have been scattered it's thy people that are coming back into the city they're starting to come back but they are not there yet do we understand that so they're coming back into the holy city to finish the transgression to make an end to sins and to make the Recon reconciliation of iniquity and to bring the Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to the and to the anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to the restore and the build Jerusalem unto Messiah the prince shall be 70 weeks now understand the G Angel Gabriel is speaking to him it says Daniel understand when the walls are being built start the clock on Messiah messiah's coming but this is the reason why it had to be done do you understand because he had given the time frame brother Brandon would say that if you want to know what day it is you look at the calendar if you want to know what day we're living in watch the Jews watch Israel so what what are we seeing in this day what are we see a rise up of of people against Israel it's that same Spirit that's going to take us out of here amen as brother William was just explaining it so perfectly last night and I actually told him I said good I wish you'd have went on that that way I could have played a tape or watched Ben her or something this morning but he was explaining about the bride and and her being called away amen and then that 144,000 that that those Jews that are consecrated Jews that were there and then the tribulation that should come so if you want to take this all back just take it to Daniel Daniel says when you hear about the walls being built that's when you start the clock on Messiah amen amen and so we look forward and brother Brandon would say you start from there it's 480 6 years from the time that Daniel two years before this has heard this and got the vision of the prophecy so it's prophecy fulfilled of the walls being built let me go on here Messiah the prince shall seven weeks and three score and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in trouble's times and after three score and two weeks shall Messiah who is Messiah here it's Jesus Christ shall be cut off but not for himself who's it for for his people and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with floods and unto the end of the war desolations are determined and shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week shall he cause the sacrifice of the oblation oblation to cease and for the overspreading of the Abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation that and that determined shall be poured upon the Desolation so we see what that is it's Jesus Christ you go forward from this point of the walls being starting to be built 483 years it is and that and that is Christ coming down Mount of Olives so as brother William was saying last night you see in Matthew let's turn to Matthew Hallelujah 21 I believe it is here yes I'm sorry to read a bunch of scriptures here but I want I want to bring this to you and make sure it's correct and you understand it here and so you you move the clock and it's Matthew 21 he's coming down off the mount said go into the village over against you and straightway you shall you shall find the ass tide and the cult uh with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the Lord hath need of them and straightway he shall send them and all of this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell ye the daughter of Zion behold the king cometh unto the meek see he's coming the cult the full of an ass he's come upon a donkey the meek as brother William was explaining it last night he's not riding a charger he's not riding a horse he's riding the donkey cult the full of an ass into the city amen Messiah coming down off the mountain amen and in verse in chapter 24 Jesus is speaking and it's Daniel's uh the abomination of desolation here and it says in verse 24 in chapter 24 and verse 15 when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy place whosoever readeth let him understand we have to have an understanding we have to have the guide this morning to be able to have that understanding of what's being Spoken Here amen so what we're seeing is the abomination of desolation so Titus that would go into and destroy those cities those Jews there and cause to be desolate then you see what it is that tribulation period that is coming that's going to be an end in Revelations 19 19 you see that what is it the end time there the Armageddon that is coming upon it amen so all of these things tie together this morning and we have to have the guide the Holy Ghost to lead us into all of this I know I have just said a lot and if you don't understand it just ask My Chauffeur brother Adam amen if y'all don't know that that's a uh there was a professor one time he uh he kept going to all these things and given the same speech over and over and over again and a chauffeur one day said you know you give that same speech over and over and over and I could do it just as good he said all right you do it this morning so they switched position he became the chauffeur and he became the professor got up and he did the exact same thing gave the same speech all over again and a student stood up and gave him some equation great equation said now Professor can can you tell us and explain this to us he said why that is the dumbest question I have ever heard in my life I tell you how dumb it is it's so dumb that you can ask my chauffeur and he'll tell you amen so not that you have any dumb questions this morning but if you have any questions about what I just said just ask My Chauffeur brother Andrew I'll pass the buck this morning on them amen isn't God good to us amen amen so do you understand where we're at this morning and prophecy being fulfilled and the understanding of what Daniel had read there so let me get into Nehemiah this morning and you wonder why would I choose Nehemiah well there's so much leadership and uh Nehemiah and you can go through Ezra Nehemiah Esther and all those books there and there's so much leadership in every single one of them and it helps us in this day and age amen so as we go to Nehemiah this morning we understand why the walls had to be built amen it was a prophecy fulfilled but it was a drawing of the Jews back into the city amen because they had been scattered abroad okay and what it was is the Jews had to find their identity right amen they had to find their identity once again because they had broken off Covenant with the Lord and so we go to Nehemiah and one and just bear with me this morning and I just pray that it all goes as planned you know sometimes it don't but praise the Lord in Nehemiah 1 and one it says in the words of Nehemiah the son of heal and it came to pass in the month of cheso in the 20th year at I was in shushan the palace and I may not get any of these words correctly so y'all bear with me amen that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of Judah and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped which there which were left in captivity concerning Jerusalem so I I want you to see Nehemiah this at this point where where he was at he was in the Palace of shushan the palace and he was a cup Bearer to the king aerus Artic Xerxes I'm sorry 20th year of Artic Xerxes we'll get there but what it was he was the cup Bearer to the king there and he had a position at this point and he had a burden for his people upon his heart so he asked about this so but to be able to be in a place of where he was at I just want to explain or just talk a little bit Nehemiah had to be a person that was loved by the people so the king chose a person that the people loved just as much as they would love him maybe even more because the cup bearer was the one that would taste the food the wines thereof before the king would eat it so he wouldn't be poisoned so he had to be a trusted individual with all the people in the city there and he had to be liked by all of the people because if he wasn't liked hey well let's just poison Nehemiah and we'll get another cup Bear right I mean easy done but he had to be like he had to have something about him where he would be walking down the marketplace and he would just go along and he'd maybe talk with somebody selling oranges or fruit or something and ask about their day and have a heart for them you understand what I'm saying there is there was something that was drawing them to his people amen he had a need for his people and the first part of leadership is it's not about you amen it it it is not about you being a leader I I if you want to be in the star and the glamour thereof I'm a leader I'm a leader I'm a leader you're not going to be one if you want to be a star go to Hollywood create a social media page yeah be a leader at that point but if you want to be a star you won't be able to do that there okay so he had a need upon his heart for the people and he asked them and they said unto them the remnant that are left in the Captivity there in the Providence are in great Affliction and reproach and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire so this what he heard about his people gave him great stress made him very sad my people is in burden so what did what is the first thing that he does in verse four it says and it came to pass when I heard of these words I sat down and I wept and mourned certain days fasted and prayed before God Of Heaven the first thing he did first thing a leader should do yeah go to prayer that's right Hallelujah the first thing a leader will do is go to prayer Amen in Psalms excuse me Proverbs 12: 15 it says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise so what did Nehemiah do the first thing he did went to prayer in every situation of your life go to prayer go to pray the first first thing right that now this is not a leadership skill but is something that you can help with your leadership abilities amen go to prayer about the situation so as he's now in prayer he there is a problem so if there is a problem you now have an opportunity and so many times people in life miss their opportunity because they're expecting something great and they just blow off yeah they they don't understand what the Lord has for them you need to understand that God's just not going to Lord I pray that I'm wealthy well if you're praying for wealth you're praying for the wrong thing God's not just going to sit down and take what the Lord has given you and do something with it I I I want to just tell a little bit of a testimony here and a lot of you will understand so back in September about the third second third week in September uh brother Ron was speaking here and I was actually in the car and a lot of you don't know this but I had had pink eye so I had sit in the car there went to the doctor come back and I was streaming service I was sitting outside in the car and brother Ron had brother William and brother Andrew stand up and he said pronounce the blessing upon each of their businesses y'all remember that y'all y a lot of you are here a lot of streaming in a lot of people claimed that blessing even for themselves a lot of you claimed that blessing said you claim that for yourself a lot of people claim that a lot of great things but I want you to understand when he prayed that our business for us me Andrew and dad was in disarray total chaos worst year that we've ever had in business since the recession worst year I was looking for a job as a police officer or Sheriff depy I was making calls but I claimed that blessing I want you to understand the opportunity that was coming I had to be looking for it I was praying about it Lord you're going to have to provide me with an opportunity to provide for my family I was willing to get out and do whatever I needed to do amen no matter what it was I was willing to get out and do it so we went to Brother Tim Pit's church for his fall meetings there meetings were going on after the meetings we went to uh brother Joe Adams house and we was just talking there and he was explaining a lot of the other uh converter guys and recycle people that they know were in the same boat as that we were in and he said you know I'm just praying the Lord Brother bless her and uh hey we was too amen but then brother Joe said I don't know if this would be something you're interested in he's like but we bought two dump trailers he's like and we're just renting them out a week and you know y'all got the trucks already maybe you could do something like that get a little extra money on the side so the opportunity now presented itself okay I was willing to do whatever the Lord had upon me to do you understand so the opportunity presented itself I called Andrew I said hey why not we have no nothing to lose here nothing to lose we ain't making no money we ain't been paid in over three months so what have we got to lose we was looking and doing scratching digging ping whatever we had to do so I said why not so the opportunity presented itself now for the past 3 weeks we have done dumpsters dump trailers and every single one of them are booked out past 3 weeks this week they're booked out as well hey and more is on the way so the opportunity is laying there in times but you have to be willing sometimes to step into it and you don't know what you're going to have to do right amen some people you know I tell Andrew and them all the time I pray that the Lord provides me with the wealth to be able to buy land so when the opportunity for the land that I'm wanting to buy comes up I have been praying for it so when it comes available I'm going to buy it amen I'm not going to sit around and say well Lord you know I have been praying about this and you have provided me with the funds to do this and it's available but Lord only you know if I really should step into this opportunity it's there it's like the woman on the roof when the flood's coming and the boat comes by three times get on the boat I I mean what do you have to do she got to heaven and the Lord said why why didn't you get on the boat said Lord I was praying for you to come down and save me he said I I sent three boats so sometimes you when you're praying about it and it comes hey go for it opportunity arises go for it amen so that was the first lesson of Nehemiah the opportunity is now come so what are you going to do about this so he comes before the king now as the cup Bearer he's saddened he's come before the king and and he satad and and the King and his Queen asked him why are you so sad what is wrong you've never come before us like this before what is wrong and he said why shouldn't I be sad when my people was in disarray the walls are not built the temple was there they can sacrifice they can go in but the the temple was there ezar Ezra built the temple but the walls thereof are in rubbish there there's no walls to protect them there is no City thereof so he now has the ability to explain to someone that he has been taught under because Nehemiah just didn't sit there and just act like he he's just a flly on a wall or whatever he learned from the King he become a leader and that's the way we grow in life a lot of times we don't know what we're going to be but as you're growing up you're going to learn things you're going to learn traits every single one of us are different amen every not all of us are carpenters brother Terry Klein built a beautiful log little miniature Log Cabin the other day I can't do that with Lincoln Logs that's not me we are all built differently so God he puts us in certain places and certain times that when the opportunity comes to help somebody you're able to do it amen and so they're asking him why are you so sad and so he explains to him about the city and the walls thereof and so they asked so what what can we do so he prayed again said Lord give me the guidance to get the request right right he prayed again Nehemiah prayed 11 times here in the book of Nehemiah prayer and said so I prayed unto the god of heaven and I said unto the king if it would please the king and If thy servant hath found favor in thy sight thou would as send me to Judah unto the city of my father's supper that I may build it so he's now he he's presenting it to the king now and the King said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thou make thy journey be they were concerned that he wouldn't come back they loved Nehemiah that much they were concerned he wouldn't come back so they said how long will thou be and wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me so he gave him an answer didn't really say but it pleased the king maybe he'll come back maybe hey it pleased him to send me and I set a time but we don't know that time but he had set a time for him there so what happens next is what we want to term as now Nehemiah is placed into a leadership role he he is now placed into a role of leadership but before he could do this he then had to learn negotiations he had to negotiate with the king and queen to be able to go do this so to be able to ask something from other people you need to learn to negotiate you need to learn what am I providing to this person that is giving them and making them better that they would help me amen so we have a lot of camp meetings a lot of um youth camps that are going on but as youth you're going to have to work and if you come before your boss and you're you every single time a youth camp comes around you go boss this is for the Lord this is for the Lord that I'm going well boss man don't know what's for the Lord there boss man only understands that if you ain't working he ain't making money do do you understand that did if if you ain't working he ain't making money so what what service are you providing him to negotiate that you can now go so so if there is a deadline that has to be met and he says no hey understand you're not providing something that he just can't go find then y'all I got plenty of money the business will survive if if they can work without you you might not be there very long when you leave and things still run smooth smoothly or smoother you might not be there very long so we see Nehemiah he negotiated a time that he was going to come back and they wanted him to come back they did not want him to leave amen so leadership what is your skill what what are you providing what what do you have laying on the inside of you every single we got a lot of our youth sitting up here and some of them's there in Tennessee but find your skill in life okay amen find what you are built for okay ask your mom and dad what do I do well do you think that I would succeed in life not everybody is going to be a speaker not everybody is going to be a carpenter not everybody's going to be a doctor but if you like doing certain little things then you can go about that and find what you're to do in life amen you know we was talking about it this week it's an incredible testimony of brother Aiden H and the garden there that they they started when they came to Dad they had just come out of a a bad situation shirt on their backs and some of you know the stories and I'm going to explain everything but when Dad was praying he just asked what's your hobby what do you like to do and he said flowers so you take at that moment what he was doing well what he could do well now it didn't just become a multiun Acre Farm overnight he didn't go to the bank and say hey the vision is this here there's going to be people come from all over the US I'm going to sell flowers everywhere and they saying go for it do it he had to set up a little shop probably somewhere and just start start little to get to where he needed to be and that's the way some of us have to do sometimes it's not going to be overnight it's not going to be instantaneous we got prodal that are coming in they're not all going to look like brother Roy and sister Darlene over here overnight I I mean Angels on the earth you know there amen so when those protocals come in it's going to take a little time so you bear with what they're learning and what they're providing to us as a congregation amen because they are the next pillars of this church if the Lord should car they're the pillars of what this church is going to be built on [Applause] Amen so he then asked for the king says moreover said to the king if it would please the king let letters be given unto me to the governors beyond the river that I may convey me over till I come to Judah he's he's granting he's given him passes to get there and letter unto Esa okay The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may be given the timber to make the beams for the gates and the palace which apparently a one of y'all to the house for the wall of the city for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to my good hand and my God upon me people are seeing something in you that's different oh yeah there is times that you're going to be lifted up in your position and people around you have been doing what you've been doing for years and you're lifted up and they stay where they're at but it's what's God's doing in you there is a light that is following you there's something on the inside that God is producing and helping you to be where you're at so he granted him all of these things Nehemiah couldn't just go to Jerusalem and the people there and say I'm here I'm Your Leader yeah this is what we're going to do you go over there and build he had to be given the tools and the materials to help build it so what did he do he was able to do this and it was able to encourage them to produce what they was trying to do they was trying to build a wall so he went and did this but in the next couple verses as he's going over to see these walls he don't go in the middle of the day he don't go and have a great Caravan and everybody's blowing their trumpets and everything else he is going in the middle of the night to see what is going on with the walls what has to be done so in our lives we have to do some things in the private am in private times to create the better goal amen he went in the secret of the night to see what was going on he went to inspect amen there's times in our prayer life we don't want Satan to know what's going to happen next cuz there's times hey we don't even know but when you're in that time that you need to go for inspection and you need to come before the Lord and say this is what's going on a private matter in the middle of the night he went to do this inspection of the wall so as a leader there's sometimes there has to be some inspections done some of you have seen Undercover Boss and the boss would come in and and there's some good workers there's some that are sorry and when it's done and said the ones that were good they keep or promote but the ones that were bad bad move on so Nehemiah went as a leader to inspect what's going on what's being done about this who's going to help me who who is around willing to stand with me to get this accomplished in the middle of the night what are they doing maybe he walked up to a window or somewhere where somebody was camping and they was praying God you know what I have need of at this moment you know we're in Desolation but Lord please send your answer and maybe he seen that and he said that one can help me that one right there is going to be one of my pillars amen amen so he went for inspection to view what was going on but you see as you come down a little bit further you run into opposition so we run into let's go to NE IAH 217 says then I said unto them Yay see the distress that they are in how Jerusalem iath in waste the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we will no more be a reproach he's telling them now hey we're no longer going to be a reproach to God Amen this is what we're going to do I have the materials y'all have the knowhow we're going to be able to do this then I told them of the good hand of my God see God was with him on this situation which was good upon me and also the king's words that they had spoken unto me and said let us arise let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work but I want you to see when you go to do when you go to start doing something good what happens opposition is on its way anytime that you go do any good for anybody somebody's going to complain it's just the way it is so we see here in uh verse 19 says but then s ballot The Hornet Knight to buth the servant the ammonite and Gish the araban I didn't say that correctly but heard it and they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will you Rebel Rebel Against The King and I answered them and said unto them God Of Heaven he will prosper us therefore his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor Memorial in Jerusalem this ain't for you that's right he was telling them this ain't for y'all I I I don't understand why y'all don't understand this but this ain't for you there's some people that it is not for the message is not for that's right but they will laugh you to scorn they will make fun of you family members will make fun of you and say and they would rather you be in the world be drunk be high be a bum than to be a Christian to live a Christlike life set in a church they would much rather you go do that because it helps them feel better the city was in rubbish the city s ruins and they're making fun of them for actually going about and doing something so you are going to have people in your life that going to oppose everything you do if you're a leader you're a leader of your children you're a leader of your household there's going to be people that will judge you on how you're doing it no matter how good of a job that you are doing there's going to be people that'll judge you right no matter what you're doing in life there will be people say well he should have done it that way I don't know how many times dad has counseled with people and given them the correct counsel and they go do the complete opposite of what he says it's amazing it is amazing granddaddy Homer he had a lot of them he he said I have I have some family members not any sitting here he said I'd tell them what to do you know they how how do I make a little money I'd tell them what to do he said they wouldn't listen to a thing opposition because they always want to do it better they think they can do do it better but they' not been provided with the tools and the access to be able to do it but this was not for them it was for the children of Israel the Jews there so we move on into chapter three and chapter three is a lot of names and a lot of things that will be who did what in the building of the wall thereof because Nehemiah could not do it by himself amen in John 10:27 says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they will follow me so he brought them to a place brought neiah to a place with a purpose and God was leading them the whole way because the people had to be led sheep has to be led amen amen in Romans 8:14 it says for as many that are led by the spirit of God are called sons of God Amen so as I was just saying there was an opposition if there is a true there's going to be a false if there is a bride there's going to be ones that aren't elected amen if there is a people that will worship there's a people that won't worship amen there's a people people that won't read the word there's a people that love the word amen there's going to be people that are going to put their hands to the work of what the Lord is doing in the church amen so understand that there's going to be some that ain't going to do a thing but in chapter three I want to S show you here what's the first thing that is built and then Elias the high priest rose up who was it it was the high priest rose up the leaders there in that City Rose up with his Brethren the priest and they build it the Sheep gate what was the Sheep gate the Sheep gate was the gate to go into the temple to worship what's the first thing they did the high priest the leaders of the church what's the first thing they're going to do they're going to create worship because God loves worship worship is the first thing that's being built on the wall the first thing we come into church what's the first thing we do we worship amen we break the ground there's some hard ground that comes in here but we break it up we break up that hard spirit that you have to go through through the week and says Lord I'm here just do something well what's the song leader doing he's starting to grind that ground he's starting to get it ready for seed to be able to drop in so the first thing that the high priest did was create worship worship where can we go we can go to worship the first thing that they did was worship worship amen Give the Lord a hand for worship this morning cuz he loves worship but they didn't just build it they Sanctified it they set up the doors of it and even made the Tower of menth and Sanctified it unto the Tower of hanani so we go on and we see there is a lot of places in here and a lot of people that are building come down to verse 5 I want you to understand in verse 5 and it says next unto them the techit repaired but their nobles put not their necks to the work of the Lord they was willing to do the work but the Elder Nobles didn't want to do a thing if you if you find some people that don't want to just do a thing hey you you just keep doing your work that's right but also you go from verse 5 over into verse 27 and what does verse 27 says and after them the teom mites repaired another piece over against the great tower that lith out even unto the wall of ill they built two different pieces they they didn't just stop at one they had a passion for what was being done they they did more than their fair share that's right and you're going to come to church sometimes and there is people that are sitting there that is going to do more than their fair share of worship amen because there's some that ain't going to do a thing there's some that's going to sit there and say I'm here help me I'm here but there's some that are saying what has to be done what what do you need done around here brother Homer had a saying said if you see it and it ain't done and you want to do it do it do it you ain't got to come ask me he'd say do it I if there's some weeds or something that needs to be done don't don't ask brother Adam Hey Brother Adam thank you for doing all you do but there's some weeds over here go pick them then then you don't have to go get him go show them that hey here they are bend your back over and pull them up there there's a group of men that come here and shovel snow every winter and if you want to come and it snows call the pastor call the leaders we're here first thing we're we're going to be able to create a place you can come and worship amen but there's people that are going to do more than their fair share and be willing to do it and not not ask a thing for it and that's the thing about leaders they are going to do stuff to help encourage other people and not ask a thing for it cuz that's what a leader does a leader is going to improve your life not always improve his he's going to make sure your life is better improve what you got amen improve so we see they did more than their fair share of the work and they and it comes down and y'all can go back and read all these or listen to it that's what I had to do because the names thereof so there is a lot of people that go about and do a lot of things and do parts of the walls and then there's some and says in verse 10 it says next unto them repaired jedii the son of har I am sorry I am not good with names as a police officer I was not good with names tell me your name again and I'd look at it I don't know even over against his house so y'all have it up there yes so they did the work that was convenient for them beside their house you can go down the road an hour and get food or you can drive 10 minutes and get fooled that's right amen so you can go to the church where you're going to get food or go to a denomination and get fooled so what you willing to do what what what what's going to you know a lot of people what is it going to help me you got to stop looking at it that way that's right it it is hard to get people but at least they did something they did something beside their own house because it was convenient for them and then there's jobs in the church as a leader that you know is a bad job you know that there's only one man that'll do the job and so you come to the wall of the dung gate yeah it wasn't the tower there's a lot of people want to help build the Tower there's a lot of people want to be there when you're doing the great work and all of it and hey let me help out what can I do and you know but there's very little that want to help with the dung gate there's very little want to help get down in the nitty-gritty and do stuff me and Dad we get down to nitty-gritty a lot of times we we get down in situations that are just you wouldn't want to be a part of it amen it it's bad Grandad Homer has in a lot of situations a certain cow got stuck in a Cellar he didn't get out and they didn't know about it we got down we had to clean out the Sellar so there was only two people that could have handled it because God built us that way he let's just say it like that that can handle Andrew he said I I'm out boys I'm out I always had a weak stomach but it had need to be built the dung gate right why sanitation where you going to go use a restroom where things where's waste going to go out of it had to be built it wasn't pretty it it ain't pretty all the time but sometimes when the Lord call you to do a purpose in your life you might go dear Lord why are you sending me to do this because the Lord built you to do that that's right amen not all of us are doctors not all of us are lawyers some of us are sanitizers amen sanitary field I I haul trash now for 11 I mean the Lord provided us a way and I wasn't scared to do it there's times you get out of the car get out in the truck and you take your boots off before you get back in the truck because it wasn't pretty out there so the people that did this their blessing might be greater because of the people that was building the tower say hey thank you thank you thank you because of what you done so God's chosen us for a certain purpose in our lives and so he will lead you to be able to do each and every one of those purposes amen and I want you to see here in verse 20 barck the son of Ze zei earnestly repaired the other piece there's a lot of people in a lot of places that's being built here understand this and chapter three is a hard one to go through but understand he did his job earnestly earnestly there's people that are coming come in through those doors and they're going to do what ever needs to be done and earnestly do it earnestly do it who was the gentleman that used to come up here s on the front row and he'd sing i' said I'd never make it Harold Blair earnestly come into the temple Hallelujah earnestly did his part earnestly during preaching would sit there and hum and sing earnestly yeah and he'd sat there and Granddaddy and Dad preach oh you said I'd never last said I'd never get away with all the sins of my past I'm still far from perfect you can plainly see and after all these years go by lord it's still you and me and he'd sing that earnestly every time and there'd be times that he'd come into church he'd run down the aisle run up through here run across through there and you go what in the world granddaddy ain't even sing just before heaven doors closed yet but he was ready to worship amen he was earnestly ready to do what needed to be done but you come down a little further and you see there's another one that built over against his house it's all right it's all right they're not going to always move at their Pew they might just stand there and say thank you Lord and you just say thank you Lord for put them here to pay the light bill so just understand that not always are you going to get people earnestly ready to worship amen as a worship leader I completely earnestly understand amen so let's move on from chapter three now so I think we've done a pretty good work here hallelujah time flying y'all enjoying it ain't you so you go through chapter three and you come down to more opposition and more reticle reticule by some B some ballot heard that the wall had build and he was rough and took great indignation and mocked the Jews there you go go again more mockings more scorning more you ain't going to do nothing even Toth the ammonite in chap in verse three of chapter 4 says said even that which they build a fox could go up and even break down the stone wall that's making fun what is this paper mâché yeah what you've done a fox could tear down it can you believe that so they met more opposition but the people had a mind to work they had a mind to do the Lord's work they kept doing what they needed to do to get it done but you see what they they come upon an adversary that did not want the wall to be built and it wasn't even for them it wasn't even for them so what happened is is while they was building the wall they'd work I brought this from more of the the kids cuz they'll remember this more than anything I said tonight Hallelujah so so they worked they built a wall and they did a just a fine job I mean this my part was beautiful and they'd come down they did a good job boom boom they'd stand back and look at it but now they're starting to get scorn and ridicule and say fox can tear that down what you just built Fox carar that down so they then this is a trial trial but we're going to call it a trio and so their Trio started to get heavy on them Lord you know I did a good job they're making fun of me and W he W he woo brother jeul forny would say w he W you know I can't praise the Lord this weekend it's been a tough day I tried to do a work for the Lord but it did it tough and they here's my trial carried around my trial I I wish I could have done a better job but there making fun of me now for so Nehemiah had to come along and pray again what he'd get down behind the wall with him he prayed he saying what are y'all going to do about this yeah there is opposition but the lord gave us the work so with your trial go do something about it stand up with what the Lord granted you with the ability to do it and work with it right amen your trial may help somebody else in life right so they came and did more of the work and more opposition come and more adversary and Sam ballot and all of them they started to go in amongst them that's the best way to do it start gossip start and then jealousy and they started creating all these things and here they were and they get their trial and then they come back they said that about me D old Fox could go up and tear down the wall there's my trial no take it go do something with it amen go go go finish your part of the Wall go do it and so they continued to come on more adversaries and more armies started come on so they had to take up arms they had to start doing something more than just work with their Tri Tri they had to get some weapons amen they had to get something that to hold them off y'all like that first time I I preached what is in thy hand amen using Moses uh shamard and all of them I had brother metas he was sitting right up here and I had him hold he had my back and he still got my back amen he's a pillar he's got my back and as I work the wall amen give me my hand and as I work the wall I was building up something I said brother M you got my back I know you do and he'd sat there and he held that thing up the rest of that service there for a little while he'd Hold That Thing Up I knew he had my back because I was having to do a work and I had somebody that would have my back Hallelujah there's some young men sitting here young ladies sitting here I got to know that they're going to have my back amen I'm going to use brother Nathan here yeah brother Nathan is now going to have my back because brother metas he's a pillar but now his work is to be able to encourage brother Nathan so when he says hallelujah amen to the word it's encouraging brother Nathan to know that hey I'm a pillar now I'm going to stand when nobody else stands brother Matthew I got your back so I have to trust him while I'm doing a work and I got to make sure that this gets done and I got to know that without a shadow of a doubt he's got my back right because there's times that I might not know what's going on as a leader as a leader as a worker in the church you might not always get every single detail of the situation that's right you hear a lot of stuff secondhand and you want to give an opinion but you don't know always the situation so you have to have people that will have your back no matter what in life so I know without a shadow a doubt while I'm doing the work and I won't come down he's back here with me he's going to praise a little bit for me he's going to worship a little bit for me he's going to get down in the gutter with me sometimes oh yeah and we're going to come through we're going to be Overcomers but there's going to come sometimes that the adversary is so great that you have to take your trial and your work and the word of the Lord sword of the spirit amen he gave you tools of warfare for a reason amen my mind went blank shamgar took what was in his hand to whip the enemy to whip the Philistine Philistines had come upon him so there's times that you're going to have to do the work of the Lord you're going to have to work and you're going to have to fight you're going to have to stop the opposition that is coming against you that is coming against your family you're going to have to be a leader of your home and you're going to have to continue the work but continue the fight that's what we're here to do we're here to continue the fight there on so y'all are going to have to be leaders in this last day drawing people to the word because we don't know who's going to be in the city when it's all said and done no man knoweth the number no man knoweth the day thereof as I was explaining earlier the days and the years and then we could count down but no man know when he cometh because he's going to come as a thief in the night so there's going to be times that you have to do a work and you're going to have to create a little Warfare he God didn't call sissies God called men and women to stand up for what is right in this last day when there's men and women that will just fall call for anything there's going to be men and women that will stand for the word of God Amen I'm not even close to finishing a lot of my stuff let's stand if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything that's just the way it is there's leaders in this last
