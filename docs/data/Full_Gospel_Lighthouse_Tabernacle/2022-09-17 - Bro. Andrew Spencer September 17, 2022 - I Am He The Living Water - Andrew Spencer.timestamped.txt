[43:37] amen amen if you have your bibles this
[43:40] evening we'd like to look over in the
[43:42] book of first corinthians
[43:44] chapter 10
[43:45] first corinthians chapter 10
[43:48] and then down to john chapter john
[43:50] chapter
[43:52] four verse 10.
[44:14] first corinthians chapter 10
[44:17] moreover brethren i would not that you
[44:20] should be ignorant how that all your
[44:22] fathers were under the cloud and all
[44:24] pass through the sea
[44:26] and were all baptized unto moses in the
[44:28] cloud and in the sea
[44:30] and did all eat the same spiritual meat
[44:34] and did all drink the same spiritual
[44:36] drink
[44:37] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[44:39] that followed them and that rock was
[44:42] christ
[44:43] john chapter 4 and verse 10
[44:49] we know that
[44:51] there's a very familiar
[44:52] scripture reading unto us as the bride
[44:54] of jesus christ our prophet would he
[44:57] would draw from this text
[44:59] over and over again after every prayer
[45:01] line he would speak of this text and we
[45:04] realized that that the bible tells us we
[45:06] could read it all but you all know the
[45:08] story but just to grab the context of it
[45:10] we realize that jesus said that he needs
[45:12] go by samaria
[45:14] there was a woman that was waiting on
[45:16] him and you know the story verse 10
[45:18] and jesus answered and said unto her if
[45:21] thou knewest the gift of god and who it
[45:24] is that saith to thee give me to drink
[45:27] thou would have wouldest have asked of
[45:29] him
[45:30] and he would have given thee
[45:32] living water
[45:33] the woman saith unto him sir
[45:36] thou hast nothing to draw with and the
[45:38] well was deep from whence then hast thou
[45:41] that living water art thou greater than
[45:44] our father jacob which gave us the well
[45:47] and drank thereof himself and his
[45:49] children and his cattle
[45:51] jesus answered and said unto her
[45:53] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[45:55] thirst again
[45:56] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[45:58] i shall give him shall never thirst
[46:01] but the water that i shall give him
[46:03] shall be in him a well of water
[46:06] springing up into everlasting life
[46:09] verse 25
[46:11] and the woman said unto him i know that
[46:13] the messiah cometh
[46:15] when he which is which is called christ
[46:19] when he has come he will tell us all
[46:21] things and jesus said unto her i that
[46:24] speak unto thee
[46:26] am he may god bless his word he may be
[46:29] seated in the presence of the lord i'd
[46:31] like to speak to you this evening just
[46:33] for a moment on i am he
[46:35] the living water i am he the living
[46:37] water brother branham said here in
[46:39] spiritual food and due season he said i
[46:41] want you to get built up now in the holy
[46:44] oracles of god in the faith
[46:47] in the faith the faith of this hour the
[46:49] faith it's going to take more faith than
[46:51] ever was in any age for this has to be
[46:54] rapturing faith be taken up and so we
[46:56] want you to believe tonight and all that
[46:59] you have seen and heard the word that
[47:01] you have heard preached the signs and
[47:04] wonders that you have seen done
[47:06] we want you to accumulate all that
[47:08] together in your heart and consider it
[47:10] whether it be that
[47:12] be that god or not we want you to
[47:15] accumulate all that together in your
[47:17] heart consider it whether it that be god
[47:20] or not it's like elisha of old said if
[47:23] god be god then serve him and if jesus
[47:26] if jesus is the center of all things to
[47:28] the christian then i think we ought to
[47:30] let loose of everything else and cleave
[47:33] to him that word accumulate it means to
[47:36] gather together and i believe that as as
[47:39] a church of the living god there are
[47:40] some things that we can gather together
[47:42] to recognize that the i am is still
[47:45] amongst the church of the living god
[47:46] when so many people are saying that that
[47:49] he's dead he's a dead god and it doesn't
[47:51] perform miracles anymore and that that
[47:53] things don't happen like they used to
[47:55] but we recognize that the same elohim
[47:58] that was there that was fellowshipping
[48:00] with abraham back there at the tent door
[48:03] that same melchizedek that came to him
[48:05] and took upon flesh he stepped into a
[48:08] theophany that same melchizedek has been
[48:10] it at the bride of jesus christ tent
[48:13] door and in the ministry of malachi 4 we
[48:15] can simply we can simply just look at
[48:18] just maybe one sermon and you can see
[48:20] that the i am was present through the
[48:22] ministry of malachi of war you could
[48:24] take any of these you could take any of
[48:26] these brothers ministries and you can
[48:27] look and see that the i am is still
[48:30] amongst the bride of jesus christ you
[48:31] can take one church service you can take
[48:34] one one little simple wednesday night or
[48:36] one saturday night service and you can
[48:38] take it and you can look at it as a
[48:40] whole and you can see the changes on
[48:42] people's lives and you can see the
[48:44] effects that the i am has upon the
[48:47] church of the living god and you can
[48:49] accumulate those things you can gather
[48:50] them together and you can say that the i
[48:53] am is amongst the church of the living
[48:55] god you can you can say he's not a god
[48:57] that's gone by you can say he's not a
[48:58] god that used to do those things but you
[49:00] can say that he's not just a god of
[49:02] yesterday but he is the god of today and
[49:05] brother branham would tell us he said
[49:07] the ability to be able to discern the
[49:09] heart and thoughts in men made the elect
[49:12] of god to understand that here was the
[49:15] messiah the anointed word of god and
[49:18] that's where you always watch the elect
[49:20] of god catching is when the hearts begin
[49:22] to get discerned and their thoughts
[49:24] begin to be get told to them things that
[49:27] they've been thinking about you
[49:28] recognize that the messiah is in the
[49:30] midst of that church or in the midst of
[49:33] the elect and you watch maybe maybe
[49:35] tonight the spirit of the lord will take
[49:37] a man of god and he'll he'll come down
[49:39] through your tin can alley and he'll
[49:40] start discerning your heart of things
[49:42] that you spoke about and things that
[49:44] you've had a conversation with your
[49:46] family about what is it it is the same i
[49:48] am it is the messiah that is working
[49:51] through his body that is speaking
[49:53] through human lips he uses human beings
[49:55] to redeem human beings and he's taking
[49:57] the word of life and he's bringing
[49:59] living water into souls so that they can
[50:02] be a water source to a dying generation
[50:05] that they can look that there is a
[50:07] source down here in laodicea there is a
[50:10] people there is a source of the holy
[50:13] ghost and i want to know where those
[50:15] people got that from i want to
[50:17] understand how they've come in contact
[50:19] with that kind of god and you are a
[50:22] water source to a dying generation to a
[50:24] world that is a desert you are an oasis
[50:27] in a desert place and the church of the
[50:30] living god has the great i am right in
[50:32] the midst of her and she doesn't take it
[50:35] for granted she doesn't underestimate
[50:37] and she doesn't just expect it but she
[50:39] understands that the word of god is
[50:42] going to prove that he's still the same
[50:44] yesterday today and forever
[50:49] in the ministry brother branham you go
[50:50] back and you start studying out you
[50:52] start studying out just just key words
[50:54] or certain things but over 135 times
[50:57] william branham stood there and when he
[50:59] was speaking to a patient he would say
[51:01] you're not from here
[51:03] now i've done a lot of studies
[51:05] throughout the message and i never heard
[51:06] anybody on that prayer line ever stand
[51:09] up and say no i'm not or you're wrong
[51:11] but what was it it was the messiah that
[51:13] was standing right there at the platform
[51:16] he said that angel standing in between
[51:18] me and you he said you feel a sweet
[51:20] spirit what was it it was the i am maybe
[51:23] he'd show up in the pillar of fire or
[51:24] maybe he'd show up in a in a whirlwind
[51:26] or maybe he'd show up in maybe at the
[51:28] pool of besides and he would stir up the
[51:31] waters and people would get healed what
[51:33] was it it was the same i am and what is
[51:36] it tonight with if you let your faith
[51:39] loose to to say that that same god is
[51:41] right here what is it it's not the man
[51:44] it's not the atmosphere it's not the man
[51:46] that creates the atmosphere it's the
[51:48] atmosphere where eagles are born at and
[51:50] you'll recognize that that is the same
[51:52] one it's not the man william branham
[51:54] that we got confidence in it's the angel
[51:57] at the pulpit that was standing there
[51:59] and was directing him he said if the
[52:01] angel didn't come i'd have been wrong on
[52:03] those seals but that angel was not
[52:05] willing that this message would perish
[52:08] and it would go off to one side or go
[52:10] off to the other but it would be this
[52:12] message that would give this people
[52:14] rapturing faith and he was proving that
[52:16] he's still the same yesterday today and
[52:19] forever
[52:19] [Applause]
[52:23] what is it it's the word
[52:25] being made flesh again that's what
[52:27] brother branham would say he said in
[52:29] christ is revealed in his own he said
[52:31] it's the word of god wound up in flesh
[52:34] you see it was a word it was a word in
[52:36] the attributes it was the word in the
[52:38] very beginning but here what what john
[52:40] said in john 1 14 that the word was made
[52:43] flesh and dwelt amongst us what was it
[52:46] it was the word
[52:48] wound up it was you've seen portions of
[52:50] it's in the prophets you've seen portion
[52:52] of it's in jeremiah you've seen portions
[52:55] of it in moses but when it come to jesus
[52:58] the word of god made flesh was wound up
[53:00] in the person
[53:02] and it took on flesh it operated in the
[53:04] flesh he got sick in the flesh he got
[53:07] tired in the flesh
[53:09] what is it god is once again wounding up
[53:12] himself in a body that will be wound up
[53:15] in the meeting and the changing in the
[53:17] meeting of the air
[53:21] that same i am is right here and that's
[53:23] what the bible said that he would be
[53:25] called that his name would be called
[53:27] elohim his name would be called emmanuel
[53:31] and to think that tonight that standing
[53:33] in the midst of the church of the living
[53:34] god is our advocate our lamb of god the
[53:38] resurrection and the life he is the
[53:40] shepherd and the bishop of our souls he
[53:42] is our judge he is the lord of lords the
[53:45] bible said that he's a man of sorrows
[53:47] the bible said he's the head of the
[53:48] church the bible said he's a master he
[53:51] says he's a faith one true witness and
[53:53] the bible said he's the rock the bible
[53:55] said he's a high priest it says that
[53:57] he's the door he should be called the
[53:59] living water he shall be called the
[54:01] bread of life he shall be called the
[54:03] rose of sharon he shall be called alpha
[54:06] and omega he is the true vine he is the
[54:09] messiah he is the teacher he is the holy
[54:13] one he is the mediator between god and
[54:15] man he is the beloved he is the holy one
[54:19] he is the branch he is the carpenter he
[54:22] is the good shepherd he is the light of
[54:24] the world
[54:25] oh is anybody tired of hearing about
[54:27] what your god is
[54:29] he is the chief cornerstone he is my
[54:32] savior he is the servant he is the
[54:35] author and a finisher of our faith he is
[54:38] the almighty he is the everlasting
[54:41] father he is our peace he is the lion of
[54:44] the tribe of judah he is the i am he is
[54:47] the king of kings he's the prince of
[54:49] peace he's our bridegroom he's the only
[54:52] begotten son he is wonderful he is
[54:55] counselor he is emmanuel he is the son
[54:59] of man he is my dayspring he is the amen
[55:03] he's the son of man he's the king of the
[55:05] jews he's the king of the prophets he is
[55:08] the redeemer he is my anchor he is my
[55:12] bright and morning star he is the way he
[55:15] is the truth and he is the life i wonder
[55:18] if you know what his name is those are
[55:21] all of his titles but his name is jesus
[55:24] and there is no other name there is no
[55:27] other power other than his name jesus
[55:30] christ where men should be saved by that
[55:33] name every knee shall bow every tongue
[55:35] shall confess
[55:37] he is the i am he is the healer of
[55:40] cancer he is the healer of sugar
[55:42] diabetes he is the healer he is the
[55:45] waymaker he is the promise keeper
[55:49] he is the i am
[55:51] who shall i say sent me moses said and
[55:55] you shall say i am that i am
[55:58] he is
[56:00] the i i.m
[56:06] life only comes by the word of god
[56:12] too many times
[56:14] too many times people stand around and
[56:16] question the word of god
[56:19] when it's in this letter form too many
[56:21] times people can sit there and they can
[56:23] question with it but our prophet told us
[56:25] that when it's made manifest nobody can
[56:27] reason with it when it becomes a reality
[56:30] you see all of those men could stand
[56:32] there and they could say that a messiah
[56:34] was coming but when the messiah was
[56:36] standing there it was the light of the
[56:38] word that had shown on the product of
[56:40] the word
[56:42] and here he is to think that tonight
[56:44] they'd been looking for him but when he
[56:46] was standing there they didn't have no
[56:48] more questions
[56:50] the elect didn't have no questions the
[56:52] unelected
[56:54] i'll say this to the church of the
[56:56] living god i understand our prophet said
[56:58] there's three kind of believers in every
[57:00] church but to the real believer tonight
[57:02] and i'm going to preach to you like you
[57:04] are but to the real believer it's no
[57:06] deception it's no question what is going
[57:09] on here it's the i am that is amongst
[57:11] you and you recognize it's the same
[57:14] messiah that was there walking on the
[57:16] shores of galilee and he's coming by
[57:19] your way to minister to your heart
[57:24] well you go you go to looking at a
[57:27] scripture reading you look at it at the
[57:28] natural and you see what drove the woman
[57:31] to the well she was looking for a source
[57:34] and to think that the bible said that
[57:35] jesus was weary and he was longing for a
[57:38] drink and he's told his disciples to go
[57:41] up there go on up there and get us some
[57:43] victims get give me something i'm hungry
[57:45] and here he goes up there and he said no
[57:47] i'm just going to wait up here at this
[57:49] whale but to think that what was a
[57:51] drawing what was the drawing of the
[57:53] natural it was a water source but look
[57:56] at it in the spiritual what was it it
[57:58] was a drawing source of the living water
[58:00] that was drawing these two together
[58:03] as i read that quote to you last weekend
[58:05] that predestinated seed when the water
[58:07] struck it it came to life
[58:09] and this this gene the seed of god was
[58:13] led by this whale
[58:17] now i want you to picture yourself
[58:19] tonight i want you to look i i want you
[58:21] to see jesus coming to your well tonight
[58:24] coming to you wherever you are and
[58:26] recognizing he is i am he's the i am of
[58:29] back problems he's the i am of troubles
[58:32] he's the i am of feelings he's the i am
[58:35] of emotions he's the i am of your
[58:37] problems of financial problems he is
[58:39] your protector he is your defender and
[58:42] he's come to set on a well tonight
[58:45] i know you've heard this a thousand
[58:47] times maybe ten thousand times of jesus
[58:49] sitting on a well but tonight he wants
[58:51] to set it your way tonight he wants to
[58:54] call your name tonight he wants to
[58:55] discern your heart
[58:59] he had a need to go by elkton
[59:02] now notice
[59:03] as webster said here about thirst he
[59:06] said it's a painful desire
[59:08] a painful a painful desire it's when you
[59:12] want something so bad until it becomes
[59:14] painful to you he said brother and said
[59:17] it's not an unnatural thing to thirst he
[59:19] said thirst is a natural thing he said
[59:21] it's simply something that god has given
[59:23] us that we could to give us a desire for
[59:26] something sometimes that god always has
[59:29] given you a control tower something that
[59:31] sets inside of you that controls these
[59:34] different desires and now this thirst
[59:36] the control tower that sits in a man's
[59:39] heart is something that god give him to
[59:42] warn him of the desires that's needful
[59:45] for him to think that tonight if you
[59:47] didn't get thirsty
[59:49] you die you can go without eating for
[59:51] about three weeks to a month but you
[59:53] can't live without water but every two
[59:55] or three days you gotta have it but god
[59:57] put something on the inside of you that
[1:00:00] would make you long for it it's a
[1:00:02] painful desire you ever been that
[1:00:04] thirsty man you drink muddy water you've
[1:00:07] been that thirsty well i ain't there
[1:00:08] nobody too too hungry or too thirsty
[1:00:10] here you i don't see too many people
[1:00:12] it's got mud around their lips but if
[1:00:14] you ever get real thirsty you'll drink
[1:00:15] from any source
[1:00:18] and a lot of times when you get real
[1:00:19] thirsty you'll start drinking from a
[1:00:21] source that ain't got living water in it
[1:00:23] it's got wiggle tails in it and what the
[1:00:25] problem is is showing you that god built
[1:00:27] you for something it's something on the
[1:00:29] inside of you that's calling for real
[1:00:32] life and you don't have to satisfy with
[1:00:34] a wiggle tail experience you don't have
[1:00:36] to satisfy with muddy water you don't
[1:00:39] have to satisfy with a muddy experience
[1:00:42] but there is a living water that is
[1:00:44] flowing from the fountain that was
[1:00:46] opened up in zechariah 13 that there is
[1:00:49] a fountain open in the house of david
[1:00:52] david said in psalms 36 and 9 that he is
[1:00:56] the fountain of life you don't have to
[1:00:58] satisfy yourself with the things of the
[1:01:01] world and the carry-on on the world but
[1:01:03] this bride has got a source and ain't
[1:01:06] never ran dry
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:12] you get thirsty enough you'll hunt for
[1:01:14] it
[1:01:16] it's a painful desire
[1:01:19] and sometimes you've got such a painful
[1:01:21] desire for healing
[1:01:23] for deliverance and maybe sometimes you
[1:01:25] just need a hug from god
[1:01:28] and if you get thirsty enough for it
[1:01:30] you'll find him
[1:01:33] i'm telling you if you get thirsty
[1:01:35] enough tonight in this service you might
[1:01:37] be on the stream all the way across the
[1:01:39] world but if you get thirsty enough
[1:01:41] tonight god will take me by the reins
[1:01:44] and pull me right to your knee it might
[1:01:46] be painful but it's bringing you to a
[1:01:49] water source
[1:01:53] [Applause]
[1:01:56] motherhood said it's satan he perverts
[1:01:57] it
[1:01:58] he said the true nature of god and the
[1:02:00] true thirst of god the body and soul by
[1:02:03] lust for sin
[1:02:04] a perversion he said we find that on a
[1:02:06] person today he said the way they took
[1:02:09] that perversion and thirst for god the
[1:02:11] thirst for for the thirst for to be
[1:02:13] pretty and all of these thirst
[1:02:16] for water they've turned it into a
[1:02:18] satisfying not with drinking
[1:02:20] the thirst for joy everybody wants to
[1:02:22] have joy thirst for fellowship all these
[1:02:25] all these great thirsts that god put
[1:02:26] into us that we might thirst after him
[1:02:29] god made you to thirst after him
[1:02:31] and we try to satisfy it with some of
[1:02:34] the kind of thirst with some other kind
[1:02:36] of perversion or of the correct thirst
[1:02:41] goodness
[1:02:42] and who did that
[1:02:44] the author of lies
[1:02:46] created this perversion of thirst
[1:02:50] but the bible tells us
[1:02:52] that the holy spirit would be three
[1:02:54] things that it would be the it would be
[1:02:56] he would be the comforter
[1:02:59] he would tell us in john 16 and 13 that
[1:03:01] he would be the spirit of truth and he
[1:03:03] would guide you into all things that are
[1:03:06] true
[1:03:06] and we recognize what controlling power
[1:03:09] that we're under we're not under you're
[1:03:11] not here tonight under satan's power
[1:03:14] satan didn't lead you to church satan
[1:03:17] didn't lead you to this hillbilly church
[1:03:19] up here on this hill where a bunch of
[1:03:21] what so-called used to be knuckleheads
[1:03:24] have gathered around the revealed word
[1:03:26] that's going to put them in a body
[1:03:28] change it was not satan that led you
[1:03:30] here it was the holy ghost and that's
[1:03:33] holy ghost it's your controlling power
[1:03:36] that is leading you to the source
[1:03:39] who guided you here none other than the
[1:03:41] spirit of truth
[1:03:45] i i've been on some ventures sometimes
[1:03:47] in life where you need a god and if you
[1:03:49] ever get a god you want to make sure
[1:03:51] he's a good god whether you whether
[1:03:52] you're going down a raft or on a river
[1:03:54] you want to make sure he knows how to
[1:03:56] steer that ship ain't that right brother
[1:03:58] andy you don't want to get on a raft
[1:04:00] with just anybody but you want to get on
[1:04:01] a raft with jesus
[1:04:03] because
[1:04:04] if you're on a raft with jesus you ain't
[1:04:06] going to hold on to the chicken rope
[1:04:08] because he's going to make sure that you
[1:04:10] get down those swells he'll you'll make
[1:04:12] sure you get down the river safely and
[1:04:14] you'll be able to eat chicken and steak
[1:04:16] on the other side of the river
[1:04:18] he's going to take care of you if jesus
[1:04:21] is in your boat you want to make sure
[1:04:22] you got the right god
[1:04:26] i i know i know some of your brother's
[1:04:28] been on hunts and you need a guy you
[1:04:30] want to make sure he's a good guy you
[1:04:32] don't want him taking you some spike you
[1:04:33] want him taking you somewhere that
[1:04:35] there's something good at
[1:04:38] let me tell you you don't want some
[1:04:39] halfway preacher behind a pulpit that's
[1:04:42] guiding you down to some halfway
[1:04:44] watered-down gospel that'll never get
[1:04:46] you anywhere you want to find somebody
[1:04:48] that's god sent god called god led that
[1:04:52] can rightly divide the word of truth
[1:04:55] you want somebody that can guide you to
[1:04:58] where it really is
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:10] i i don't know
[1:05:12] maybe i'm maybe i'm telling stories out
[1:05:13] of school here but you ever been to a
[1:05:15] museum or maybe been to a place a lot of
[1:05:17] times you find them at a place of
[1:05:18] history
[1:05:20] and you go to this you go to a museum
[1:05:22] and you go through there and there they
[1:05:24] they you can't if you go through it on
[1:05:26] your own you ain't gonna find out half
[1:05:28] of what's in there
[1:05:30] you can try to read every sign but
[1:05:31] you're gonna miss it but they got these
[1:05:33] doohickeys that you can put in your ear
[1:05:35] and as you walk through as you walk
[1:05:37] through certain locations it'll tell you
[1:05:39] what you're seeing it'll tell you that
[1:05:41] this artifact was it was it was from the
[1:05:43] 1800s and and this was placed here by
[1:05:46] this king or that that president or this
[1:05:48] that or the other or maybe you're out of
[1:05:50] battlefield and you've got these things
[1:05:51] on you're listening to them and they're
[1:05:53] telling you what you're seeing now i
[1:05:55] went to i tried to find out how in the
[1:05:57] world does that do hickey tell me what
[1:05:59] i'm looking at how does it know it's got
[1:06:01] a gps on the inside of it and it tells
[1:06:04] you what location you're at and what
[1:06:06] location you're at it'll tell you a
[1:06:08] signal what you're seeing
[1:06:10] now if you were sitting there and that
[1:06:12] doohickey on your ear was telling you
[1:06:14] that you were looking at a a piece of
[1:06:16] heart that george washington painted
[1:06:18] himself and you're over here and you're
[1:06:20] looking at a bush
[1:06:22] that doohickey is wrong
[1:06:26] the voice is wrong with the location
[1:06:28] that you're at
[1:06:30] it might be true that there's a bush
[1:06:32] somewhere and it might be true that
[1:06:33] there's a painting somewhere but the
[1:06:35] voice has got mixed up
[1:06:37] where you are and where your location is
[1:06:39] but this voice that is leading you here
[1:06:42] has brought you to laodicea and this
[1:06:44] seventh angel's voice has told you where
[1:06:47] to get overcoming power out he's told
[1:06:49] you where you're living at he didn't
[1:06:50] tell you it was in a restless day or
[1:06:52] luther's day and tried to give you some
[1:06:55] creed he gave you the manna for this
[1:06:57] hour that'll make sure at the location
[1:07:00] that you are
[1:07:01] let me tell you noah's message wouldn't
[1:07:03] work this day moses message wouldn't
[1:07:06] work his day but this is the day of the
[1:07:09] revealing of the son of man and because
[1:07:11] you're in the light
[1:07:12] location
[1:07:14] because you where you are there's a gps
[1:07:17] tracker on you and it says you're going
[1:07:20] through this trial i'm isaiah 53 i'm
[1:07:23] going through this trouble i am the lord
[1:07:25] thy god that heals thee
[1:07:28] there's a voice that's leading you
[1:07:30] through what you're seeing and the voice
[1:07:32] is the voice of truth
[1:07:38] we ain't got some doohickey on our
[1:07:41] we got the voice
[1:07:43] it's the same one that's sitting at the
[1:07:45] throne room of our heart
[1:07:48] he cares what you're listening to
[1:07:55] you remember when brother manum said
[1:07:56] you go to listen that sermon to god
[1:08:01] he starts talking about that north star
[1:08:03] that it represents christ
[1:08:05] he said you don't want just some
[1:08:06] ordinary man leading you around
[1:08:10] you want somebody knows where they're
[1:08:11] going at
[1:08:13] you ever
[1:08:15] every man is going to be able to see a
[1:08:16] man right here i think
[1:08:18] where every wife's going to be elbowing
[1:08:19] him
[1:08:21] you ever been somewhere you ain't never
[1:08:22] been before
[1:08:23] and you get yourself turned around
[1:08:25] you're not lost you just turned around
[1:08:30] and finally you had to stop at some gas
[1:08:32] station your wife had to roll down the
[1:08:34] window and say
[1:08:36] ask him
[1:08:40] you're the one who drove me here asking
[1:08:42] that ain't happen to me yet
[1:08:44] but
[1:08:46] i've been a part of some things in life
[1:08:50] and i know what i'm talking about
[1:08:52] you see you were never lost you just
[1:08:55] didn't know exactly where you was at
[1:09:01] [Applause]
[1:09:06] praise god we can leave we've had church
[1:09:08] everybody's elbowed right now need
[1:09:10] prayers for ribs
[1:09:13] but you get a good god
[1:09:15] and i'll tell you you think you got a
[1:09:16] good guy by that name of siri and that
[1:09:18] thing will lead you right into a pond if
[1:09:20] you ain't too careful turn now better
[1:09:22] watch out you're going to turn into a
[1:09:23] cattle field and you're going to pray
[1:09:25] that you have the same love that william
[1:09:27] branham had when that bull comes running
[1:09:28] at you
[1:09:31] you want a god that's going to lead you
[1:09:32] down the right path and brother madam
[1:09:34] said that unthoughtful father up there
[1:09:36] that had seen that picture he'd seen
[1:09:38] that picture in that magazine of that
[1:09:40] deer standing on a mountaintop he took
[1:09:42] his son that had never been hunted
[1:09:44] before he's seven years old and he takes
[1:09:46] him to the son he said the biggest bucks
[1:09:48] are up there on that mountain and he
[1:09:50] said he starts tracking himself up there
[1:09:52] he didn't have a guide to go with him
[1:09:54] and when it got dark he got turned
[1:09:56] around and didn't know how to get off
[1:09:58] the mountain and it got cold and the boy
[1:10:01] lost his life because the father didn't
[1:10:03] take a god because it got too dark and
[1:10:05] brother branham said that's a problem
[1:10:07] with too many christians a day they've
[1:10:09] gone on past the darkness and went on
[1:10:11] without a god
[1:10:13] but he the spirit of truth is here to
[1:10:16] bring you to the light of the hour
[1:10:21] when william branham starts talking
[1:10:22] about he starts talking about when the
[1:10:24] children of israel when they got in
[1:10:26] their testing time and and the spirit of
[1:10:29] the lord is leading them the pillar of
[1:10:31] fire by night in the cloud cloud by day
[1:10:34] he's leading them and brother branham
[1:10:36] said that the church of israel had got
[1:10:38] into a testing time and they got there
[1:10:40] and they got the fussing with their
[1:10:42] leader
[1:10:44] they got to fussing with their leader
[1:10:46] and flustering about the path and how
[1:10:48] they were going and brother madam said
[1:10:50] they got led out there to whorehop which
[1:10:52] means a dry place or a desert and he
[1:10:54] said when we get out of fellowship with
[1:10:56] one another or in the church or
[1:10:58] fellowship with the holy spirit he said
[1:11:00] it brings us to a dry place a desert
[1:11:02] nothing's alive everything's got
[1:11:04] stickers on it
[1:11:08] he said but when you see somebody like
[1:11:10] that he said maybe it's a precious soul
[1:11:13] that could have been watered right he
[1:11:15] said it would have been tender little
[1:11:17] leaf or something but instead it's wound
[1:11:19] itself up till it's a little sticker and
[1:11:22] it's just punching at everything you
[1:11:24] know finding fault only thing its needs
[1:11:27] is just a little water
[1:11:30] well thank god we found a water source
[1:11:35] i'll just preach to these people on the
[1:11:37] internet
[1:11:39] you just come out
[1:11:42] you just come out of one of the greatest
[1:11:44] meetings that you ever had two weeks ago
[1:11:47] but how many found out in the past two
[1:11:49] weeks that you still human
[1:11:55] every single day you got to have a
[1:11:57] little bit more jesus
[1:12:01] it's me it's me it's me oh lord standing
[1:12:05] in a need our prayer
[1:12:08] he said but it's just needs a revival
[1:12:13] we just had one
[1:12:15] we just had one of the greatest revivals
[1:12:18] but you just need a revival or a
[1:12:22] breaking up or refreshing from the lord
[1:12:24] until it unfolds itself if you'll just
[1:12:27] put it through the water
[1:12:30] until you get out of laodicea until you
[1:12:33] take a body change you're gonna need
[1:12:35] some water you're gonna get around
[1:12:36] people and you're gonna get around
[1:12:38] problems that's gonna cross cause that
[1:12:40] little sticky nature
[1:12:46] satan will get in the details they're
[1:12:47] getting a lot of fuss and all of a
[1:12:49] sudden you get that sticky little nature
[1:12:51] punching at everything i'm quoting the
[1:12:53] prophet
[1:12:54] what you need
[1:12:56] is just a little bit of water
[1:12:58] he said but that's where them who live
[1:13:00] in that place has to suffer with the
[1:13:02] conditions of that place he said and
[1:13:04] those who desire to live in that kind of
[1:13:06] atmosphere where everything is punching
[1:13:08] and fussing and quarreling and stewing
[1:13:11] like that he said you just live under
[1:13:13] that atmosphere that's all he said but
[1:13:15] you don't have to live there
[1:13:19] it's not necessary for us to stay there
[1:13:21] he said but that now this horeb was a
[1:13:24] place where god was discouraged with the
[1:13:26] people
[1:13:27] because they had wandered in this place
[1:13:30] and gotten in that kind of condition and
[1:13:32] brought them right around to it because
[1:13:34] they wouldn't walk in the path
[1:13:37] to think that here is the greatest
[1:13:40] greatest prophet moses the moses the
[1:13:42] deliverer but yet they're quarreling
[1:13:44] with moses
[1:13:46] they're fighting with moses they're
[1:13:47] bickering with moses
[1:13:49] and god brings him up in exodus 17 he
[1:13:52] tells him go speak to the rock smite the
[1:13:55] rock
[1:13:56] and instead
[1:13:58] of god smiting the people with that
[1:14:00] judgment rod he smote the rock
[1:14:03] when all they were doing was murmuring
[1:14:05] and complaining what did he do he smote
[1:14:07] the rock which was a type of christ at
[1:14:09] calvary
[1:14:11] and when he smoked the rock out of it
[1:14:14] came living water
[1:14:18] to think of it
[1:14:19] to think of it when you deserved when
[1:14:21] you deserve to be smitten
[1:14:24] he was smitten for you
[1:14:26] and brother burnham said that that rock
[1:14:29] that was smitten will follow you
[1:14:30] everywhere
[1:14:34] it was a type of calvary and to think
[1:14:36] that thy rock
[1:14:38] it had their healing in it it had their
[1:14:40] desires in it it brought them salvation
[1:14:43] it brought perishing people to a place
[1:14:46] of refuge it brought life to a dying
[1:14:49] people what was it that rock was christ
[1:14:55] what does water represent it represents
[1:14:57] the spirit and when christ was smitten
[1:15:00] what come forth living water his spirit
[1:15:05] remember the man said he said he said
[1:15:07] now look he said i've seen all kinds of
[1:15:09] intellectual pictures about people
[1:15:11] drawing this little trickle of water
[1:15:13] coming out of this rock he said but this
[1:15:15] ain't some intellectual rock he said
[1:15:18] there was two million people that had
[1:15:20] need of supply of water there was two
[1:15:22] million cattle two million oxen two
[1:15:25] million camels that needed water
[1:15:29] this message ain't some intellectual
[1:15:31] rock it is the fundamental faith of
[1:15:34] jesus christ
[1:15:35] it's got enough for you right now it's
[1:15:38] got enough for your future and it's got
[1:15:40] enough for your past
[1:15:45] let me tell you it doesn't matter where
[1:15:46] you came from and it doesn't matter
[1:15:48] where you think you're going the rock is
[1:15:50] here to follow you
[1:15:52] out of that rock come gushing water
[1:15:55] the one that was smitten went with you
[1:15:59] they forgot notice
[1:16:01] they didn't follow the rock the rock
[1:16:02] followed them
[1:16:07] the rock followed them
[1:16:09] and when they got thirsty
[1:16:11] the rock was near
[1:16:13] when you're in trouble
[1:16:15] he is jehovah nessie when you in need he
[1:16:18] is jehovah niesi when you need him he is
[1:16:21] jehovah shammah when you need peace he
[1:16:24] is jehovah shalom when you need
[1:16:26] providing he is jehovah gyra
[1:16:33] it was
[1:16:35] too many times people think it's just
[1:16:37] just one feeling
[1:16:38] oh no
[1:16:41] when this comes out it's an abundance of
[1:16:43] water
[1:16:44] you go look it up you go look up you go
[1:16:47] look up on the internet moses smite in
[1:16:49] the rock and it'll show you that picture
[1:16:51] brother random's drawing this from he
[1:16:53] said it's just a little trickle water
[1:16:55] coming out of a little pipe but this
[1:16:58] is an artesian whale
[1:17:01] and out of it is flowing living water
[1:17:03] it's got enough for your children
[1:17:06] i know some of you i got a call today of
[1:17:08] a mama that was in complete despair
[1:17:16] i gotta have my prodigals back it was
[1:17:19] enough there's enough water in this rock
[1:17:21] for every prodigal for every wayward son
[1:17:24] for every wayward daughter for every
[1:17:26] wayward older person there's enough
[1:17:29] water in this rock
[1:17:33] he lost his power and he ain't lost his
[1:17:35] touch the same pillar of fire is here to
[1:17:39] lead the children of israel to their
[1:17:41] promised land
[1:17:45] it's an abundance of water
[1:17:55] that's what jesus said
[1:17:57] he said if any man thirst
[1:17:59] let him come unto me and drink and he
[1:18:01] that believeth on me as a scripture said
[1:18:02] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:18:05] living water notice rivers plural of
[1:18:08] living water not plural think it's one
[1:18:11] spirit
[1:18:12] by one spirit we're all baptized
[1:18:14] to think that he is our artesian well
[1:18:17] he is our water in a dry and weary land
[1:18:21] he was hagar's rock when ishmael when
[1:18:24] ishmael and hagar was kicked out by
[1:18:26] sarah he was hagar's rock in her bear
[1:18:29] sheep when she put ishmael a bow shot
[1:18:32] away from her he was her rock
[1:18:36] here
[1:18:38] this ain't the promised son
[1:18:41] i know i'm getting real touchy right
[1:18:43] here but here ain't the promise on but
[1:18:44] he's still come forth from abraham
[1:18:48] not everybody's going to be bright but
[1:18:50] they still get salvation from our lord
[1:18:53] and hear hagar's son ishmael history
[1:18:56] tells us that ismail was 16 years old at
[1:18:59] this time and she put him six she put
[1:19:01] him a bow shot away from her because she
[1:19:04] couldn't stand to see him die in a first
[1:19:07] but the angel said i heard they're
[1:19:10] crying from the lad
[1:19:14] that ought to give every single one of
[1:19:16] you hope tonight that think they'll
[1:19:18] never be bright or they'll never get to
[1:19:20] the water source he's heard your lads
[1:19:22] cry
[1:19:23] he was hagar's rock he is my rock
[1:19:27] he is my rock of defense he is my
[1:19:30] shelter in the storm he is my everything
[1:19:41] he said but people
[1:19:44] people are afraid of it
[1:19:47] to think we're living this quote out the
[1:19:49] people are afraid of the power of god
[1:19:52] they're afraid of this holy ghost
[1:19:53] they're afraid of this water he said
[1:19:55] people are afraid of it he said some
[1:19:57] people say well i'm just a little afraid
[1:19:59] i'll do this or that or the other or if
[1:20:01] i happen i'll go to i'll go go a little
[1:20:04] too deep he said i can or people say i
[1:20:06] can show you somebody that went a little
[1:20:08] too far he said but you never do point
[1:20:10] out the ones that didn't go far enough
[1:20:14] people always want to show you somebody
[1:20:16] that went too far and went off the deep
[1:20:18] end but they never want to show you
[1:20:21] they never want to show you judas and
[1:20:23] they never want to show you the rich
[1:20:24] wrong your lord
[1:20:26] i'd rather be thought a fanatic and be
[1:20:28] standing for christ than never go far
[1:20:30] enough
[1:20:33] some people are afraid well if i if i
[1:20:35] get in the spirit and i begin to dance
[1:20:37] and i begin to shout i wash this makeup
[1:20:39] right off my face i watch this or i
[1:20:41] watch what is it
[1:20:44] let me tell you if you're his seed the
[1:20:46] water will strike you
[1:20:49] and it doesn't matter what condition you
[1:20:51] are in it doesn't matter what you're
[1:20:53] running from this woman of john 4 was
[1:20:56] corrupted as any person could get
[1:20:58] corrupted
[1:21:01] she'd been to this water time
[1:21:03] and time and time again
[1:21:06] she went to jacob's well for relief and
[1:21:08] she didn't find no relief she went to
[1:21:10] men after men and she didn't find no
[1:21:12] relief and she'd go back to the well one
[1:21:14] day and she'd have to go back the next
[1:21:16] day
[1:21:19] and you may have walked to this same
[1:21:20] well many times
[1:21:22] but one time when he's sitting on the
[1:21:24] well
[1:21:27] the one time he starts calling out your
[1:21:28] name and he starts calling out your
[1:21:30] secrets about who you've been with and
[1:21:33] where you were
[1:21:38] he starts calling you out and think
[1:21:40] about the power of the place of this
[1:21:43] well
[1:21:44] you study it out in the scriptures
[1:21:46] it's a very remarkable place as being
[1:21:48] that where abraham first stopped on his
[1:21:51] coming from quran to canaan it was where
[1:21:53] god first appeared to abraham the
[1:21:55] patriarch and promised to give the land
[1:21:57] to a seed it was also the place where
[1:22:00] abraham first built an altar to the lord
[1:22:02] and called upon his name it is also
[1:22:06] this was the piece of property that
[1:22:08] jacob bought in genesis 33 and 19 and 20
[1:22:12] that he made an altar and he erected
[1:22:14] that altar and called it el he aloha
[1:22:18] israel which means the strong god or the
[1:22:21] covenant god of israel now this woman
[1:22:24] that had walked to this well
[1:22:27] she'd been there time and time again
[1:22:30] she didn't need some weak man
[1:22:33] to lead her down the same paths that
[1:22:34] she'd already been down
[1:22:36] she needed a strong god the covenant god
[1:22:38] of israel to meet her
[1:22:42] brother branham said that she knew
[1:22:44] that she was at the spot of her life
[1:22:47] when our occupation was about over
[1:22:49] and you understand what i'm saying
[1:22:52] her life was about over
[1:22:54] her her occupation was about to be taken
[1:22:57] away from her
[1:22:58] but she's standing
[1:23:00] at the well with
[1:23:04] with the i am
[1:23:10] this woman
[1:23:11] nobody wanted her in her house
[1:23:14] this woman was looked down on
[1:23:16] this woman couldn't walk down the
[1:23:18] streets or walk down the aisles with
[1:23:20] people smirking at her
[1:23:22] people turning their cheeks at her
[1:23:24] thinking man this woman's of ill fame
[1:23:27] but she was standing at the spot
[1:23:31] she was standing at the very spot where
[1:23:34] joseph bones were buried at
[1:23:38] because joseph had told those children
[1:23:40] don't you bury my bones down there in
[1:23:43] his hand egypt you take my bones up
[1:23:46] there where the resurrection's coming
[1:23:48] joseph
[1:23:49] being a prophet knew that there was a
[1:23:51] messiah that was coming
[1:23:54] and to think where you're standing at
[1:23:56] right here in this town the gps hasn't
[1:23:59] brought you to some wrong spot
[1:24:01] he's brought you here because there's
[1:24:03] water here
[1:24:07] you've drunk water and you may even
[1:24:09] drunk message water one time but it
[1:24:11] didn't satisfy your soul because
[1:24:13] somebody was trying to put their own
[1:24:15] experience with the word
[1:24:17] but if this message is preached in its
[1:24:19] entirety if it's preached in its truth
[1:24:22] it'll produce the same life the same
[1:24:25] power
[1:24:27] she didn't need somebody else's
[1:24:29] watered-down gospel she needed jesus
[1:24:35] when he found me
[1:24:39] when he found me on the streets in
[1:24:41] canada i didn't need i didn't need some
[1:24:44] weak gospel i'd got myself in trouble
[1:24:46] after trouble after trouble
[1:24:52] what is it
[1:24:54] it's the grace of god that led you to
[1:24:55] the water
[1:25:01] you think well i'm too far gone
[1:25:03] or this one's too far gone when you
[1:25:05] think you're god too far gone the blood
[1:25:06] of jesus christ goes further
[1:25:10] mean i i i pretty much know everybody's
[1:25:13] situation or their circumstance here and
[1:25:15] ain't nobody got the situation this
[1:25:17] woman had
[1:25:20] i know what i'm talking about but this
[1:25:22] woman was so scarred up had so many
[1:25:25] complexes had so many stigmas she
[1:25:28] couldn't walk down the aisle
[1:25:30] without somebody thinking the wrong
[1:25:32] thing about her
[1:25:35] it's amazing
[1:25:37] that when you get in trouble
[1:25:38] not these people i know y'all sweet
[1:25:40] angels i heard that there were some
[1:25:42] people had to hang their angel wings
[1:25:43] back up there in the vestibule
[1:25:46] am i right about this
[1:25:49] but it's amazing
[1:25:51] when you need grace
[1:25:54] oh man when you need grace
[1:25:57] you don't want nobody
[1:25:59] casting a stone but when somebody else
[1:26:01] needs it
[1:26:02] i don't know
[1:26:04] if she really was a christian
[1:26:07] you know if i was a christian like i was
[1:26:08] a christian they wouldn't need as much
[1:26:10] church as i get
[1:26:13] you know as some people have got that
[1:26:14] teacup
[1:26:17] show up every once in a while
[1:26:19] ceo christians christian christmas and
[1:26:21] easter only
[1:26:23] got that teacup
[1:26:25] man i sure am glad i ain't like that
[1:26:26] brother alden back here he has to come
[1:26:28] every single night
[1:26:32] he must be some bad dude
[1:26:35] it's a bit
[1:26:36] he got to come every night he seems like
[1:26:38] he's always amen and because a preacher
[1:26:40] is preaching all around i'd hate to be
[1:26:42] like that guy it's amazing when you get
[1:26:44] in trouble
[1:26:45] you want grace but when somebody else
[1:26:47] gets in trouble you can't give out the
[1:26:48] same grace that you want back
[1:26:54] ah what i love about jesus jesus ain't
[1:26:56] stingy with his blood and jesus ain't
[1:26:58] stingy with his grace and jesus ain't
[1:27:01] stingy with his miracles and jesus ain't
[1:27:03] stingy with his deliverances this woman
[1:27:07] even though she was scarred even though
[1:27:09] she had complexes she did not let that
[1:27:11] hold her back
[1:27:15] what was it when she found the water
[1:27:17] source she said come and see a man
[1:27:21] come and see a man that's told me
[1:27:23] everything that i ever did
[1:27:26] is not this the messiah brother madam
[1:27:28] said it was like a house on fire on a
[1:27:30] windy day you couldn't put her out
[1:27:33] what's wrong with this church they got
[1:27:35] set on fire
[1:27:38] and they can't be put out it's the holy
[1:27:41] ghost that is moving the church of the
[1:27:43] living god
[1:27:46] try to stop us and we'll just blow on
[1:27:48] harder

[1:27:55] burn down the united states you set a
[1:27:57] man on fire and the world will come and

[1:28:08] satan wanted you
[1:28:11] he had the goods on you
[1:28:13] he knew your family history and he knew
[1:28:15] your dna but when adam forfeited the
[1:28:17] rights it didn't afford that forfeited
[1:28:20] title deed didn't go into satan's dirty
[1:28:22] hands the author almighty god took that
[1:28:25] book when satan wanted your life
[1:28:28] he said mercy said no
[1:28:31] [Applause]
[1:28:33] satan was trying to get to you
[1:28:36] but your bow ass stood up for you

[1:28:48] picks up my wheat i like the way she
[1:28:50] picks up my message i like the way she
[1:28:52] carries it i like the way she dresses
[1:28:56] she ain't for everybody but she's mine
[1:29:02] i tell you
[1:29:05] satan tried his very best to get you but
[1:29:07] god said no
[1:29:11] brother branham said have you ever heard
[1:29:12] me say satan take your hands
[1:29:15] off of god's property
[1:29:19] you see when jesus is up there matthew
[1:29:21] chapter 4 and the amount of temptation
[1:29:23] and he goes up there and jesus or satan
[1:29:25] tries to offer jesus though kingdoms of
[1:29:28] the world without a calvary he said i'm
[1:29:30] gonna give them to you but brother
[1:29:31] banham told us that jesus knew that he
[1:29:34] was gonna fall heir to them in the
[1:29:35] millennium
[1:29:36] he said and the earth was his he said
[1:29:38] but the earth has got to be loose from
[1:29:40] the grip of satan politics has got to be
[1:29:42] ruse loose from the grips of satan all
[1:29:45] of these world council churches has got
[1:29:47] to be loose from the say to the grip of
[1:29:49] satan
[1:29:52] go listen to it he tells us that in
[1:29:53] future home he goes in there he said but
[1:29:56] oh
[1:29:57] he said what is it he said you're not
[1:29:59] annihilated he said you've changed
[1:30:02] and just like he is going to in in
[1:30:04] matthew 24 and 35 that heaven and earth
[1:30:06] will pass away but my word shall never
[1:30:09] pass away that word means to change
[1:30:13] and to think that you can't be
[1:30:14] annihilated
[1:30:17] to think that you can't be stopped to
[1:30:19] think that you can't be destroyed
[1:30:21] but brother branham told us in the token
[1:30:24] that when you confess your sins it goes
[1:30:26] back upon the head of satan
[1:30:29] and your and your sins are annihilated
[1:30:33] to think that tonight you can't be
[1:30:35] annihilated but you're seeing your
[1:30:37] mistakes your troubles
[1:30:39] [Applause]
[1:30:43] you ain't got to worry about covering
[1:30:45] this up you ain't got to worry about
[1:30:46] sweeping this under the covers you ain't
[1:30:48] got to worry about hiding it under the
[1:30:50] rug the cross
[1:30:51] took your sin the cross took your shame
[1:30:55] all of your guilty habits
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:30:58] the i am
[1:30:59] [Applause]
[1:31:01] part himself
[1:31:05] be i am
[1:31:08] and i will pour out my spirit on all
[1:31:10] flesh upon my sons and my daughters
[1:31:15] what is it it's the living water
[1:31:17] being poured out
[1:31:24] satan can't hold your healing back
[1:31:29] satan can't hold your breakthrough back
[1:31:32] satan can't hold your experience back
[1:31:36] it's yours
[1:31:38] because the i am is sitting at your well
[1:31:44] you've had a lot of drinks
[1:31:46] you've been to a lot of places
[1:31:49] you've been scarred a lot
[1:31:53] but the scars didn't hold her back
[1:32:00] been manhandled
[1:32:02] been abused
[1:32:06] but the scars can't hold him back
[1:32:09] he is running after you with the eyes
[1:32:13] full of fury and he's making sure that
[1:32:15] he gets you
[1:32:20] and you're gonna be like the man in john
[1:32:22] chapter nine
[1:32:25] when jesus walks to that blind man
[1:32:27] and he heals him
[1:32:29] and there was confusion whether this was
[1:32:31] a man or not
[1:32:34] i don't think it's him
[1:32:38] it looks like whitney breeden but i
[1:32:39] don't think it's her
[1:32:41] it looked like joel strike but i don't
[1:32:43] think it's him
[1:32:50] it can't be that one
[1:32:52] they could not be the one that stood
[1:32:54] there under that condition all of their
[1:32:56] life
[1:32:57] and really be living in the sight that
[1:33:00] they're living in it can't be them
[1:33:03] but i love his confession i am he
[1:33:08] he sat on all the questions with his
[1:33:10] voice
[1:33:11] why don't you silence satan's
[1:33:14] accusations and say i am the one
[1:33:17] that jesus thought so much of that he
[1:33:20] came for me that he bled for me that he
[1:33:23] gave his life for me
[1:33:26] and the i am will stand up for you like
[1:33:28] he did in revelations 1 and 18 i am he
[1:33:32] that was dead but i am alive forevermore
[1:33:35] and i have the keys of death hell and
[1:33:38] the grave everything that could have
[1:33:40] locked you up heaven turned loose
[1:33:46] hallelujah
[1:33:49] hallelujah
[1:33:50] you're no longer in the prison house

[1:34:03] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:16] blessed be the name of the lord
