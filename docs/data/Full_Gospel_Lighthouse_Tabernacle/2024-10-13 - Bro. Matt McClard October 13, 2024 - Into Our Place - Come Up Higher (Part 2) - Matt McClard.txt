brother Gabriel would prepare to take these needs to the Lord for us dear church family please remember brother Clarence he's back in the hospital with fluid on his lungs I made a mistake last night and said his heart but it fluid is on his lungs and so we want to remember our brother Clarence mois there and church family please remember sister Brenda Collins in your prayers she's had hip surgery and is in a lot of pain we want to remember Sister June shifflet and the elderly in our church my dad he needs a Touchin body if you lift up brother Garland please pray for Sister Lisa Morse she has several major needs in her body also prayers for her sister Martha who fell yesterday morning and has found out she has some medical issues going going in her body also my brother Jerry fre he's fell yesterday and fractured his back that's from Sister Mary moris Brother G maybe you have a need on your heart this morning lift it before the [Music] Lord how many enjoyed that service last night I had just brother Matthew if you've never got to meet him or be around him I suggest you do that cuz he's you know when when we hear brother brandom talk about a humble servant that's brother Matthew and I've been around him for the last handful of years and several occasions and I'm telling you he's he's a he's a servant that just wants to do nothing but especially serve the youth and uh just be here for the people and be a servant and you're going to if you didn't watch last night I suggest you go back you got into a Channel of forgiveness and just started nailing some things that are right down a path that each and every one of us can go back and listen to time and time again let's just take these knes to the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just so grateful to be able to come and gather here once again this morning and there's not one service that we want to take for granted that we could come and be here and Lord we could just we can just take a look back at the storms that's that swept through areas that's never had storms like that and we we see the ones in Tennessee and the all the help and the love that's going to those and I just want us to take and be able to look at that and say you know that's a Thousand-Year flood as they would call it and how quickly things could be how quickly things could be lost these what we have here on Earth is is perishable but the greatest thing of all could be your love Lord and our brotherly love for one another and just a love and a kinded spirit of you Lord and Lord we hear each and every one of these prayer requests that would go forth as we see brother Clarence there and he's got fluid there on his lungs I just believe that you could just go and you could you could just remove that you've designed our bodies to be able to just absorb those things and put them right back into place to where it's like they were never there and you can just remove you can remove tumors you can remove cancers you can remove each and everything that's in our life and Lord Jesus I believe that even even greater than that the the greatest sin of all is just just have an unbelief Lord and I just believe that that you could just come and you could take away all all unbelief for any any situation that we may be facing and lost loved ones that may be out in the world that it seems like there is no hope it seems like there's no hope to bring them back in but we're seeing it each and every day we're seeing it as as you're calling loved ones home and you're calling each and every one of us right right back to our rightful place with you and Lord Jesus we know that predestination is is everything and there's a there's been a seed and if you put a seat in our seed in our life before the foundation of the world there's not one thing that Satan can do to remove us and Lord Jesus I pray that you would be with brother Matthew here this morning as he would bring forth the word just anoint him once more allow him to fall into the chainel that you would you would need each and every one of us to hear and speak directly to our needs and we're just so thankful for what you're about to do and what you did down there in Louisiana for those and brother Ron we just ask you continue to strengthen him and we just thank you for all that you are doing in Jesus name we pray [Music] amen as we prepare to take up the offerings this morning I just want to remind everybody again in case they missed it there last night next Sunday October the 20th will be our Wild Wild West Fall Fest and we're excited to see everyone

going WR in the word sure enjoyed last night I don't know I enjoyed myself whether you did or not I have I enjoy the presence of the Lord I enjoy it amen I enjoy people that love the word of God amen amen I enjoy when somebody begins to pull on you amen we have church and you don't know what that does to a preacher amen hallelujah amen amen good to be in the house of the Lord just Philippians chapter 3 then we're going to Revelations chapter 4 I believe and Philippians chapter 3 very familiar scriptures here but I believe very timely we're going to stay on our thought by the help of the Lord into our place come up higher verse 13 there Philippians 3 if you have that say amen amen Brethren I count it not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do you know this is the Apostle Paul and he's telling us you got to do this oh yeah amen if he's telling you this is what I have to do do you think Paul did some things that were bad oh yeah to him for for the Apostle Paul to say I'm the chiefest of Sinners yeah I know some of us would like to argue that with him amen but but he's telling you something that is an absolute key for you to go up higher he's telling you something that is an absolute key so I don't know who it is this morning that's got their I'm preaching already but whoever's got their past that is trying to hold them back God wants to break that for you this morning that you can come into the body into your position let me finish reading I'm wide open leave me alone this how I go I believe you're right there with me amen he says but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching ing forth unto those things that are before I press to the mark of the prize of the High Calling what kind of calling is it it's not a low calling it's not a halfway calling he's calling you higher oh yeah of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded if anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal this unto you may have your seats this morning we'll get to revelations in just a minute I want to preach on your past for just a minute come on there's a funny shelf down here so I thought there was a reason for it figured it out amen you know I I don't know where you're at this morning but I believe God is calling and I'm going to stay on the same topic but it's just within my heart that not only for the minister to come up higher not only for the Deacon to come up higher the trustee the Ley every youth come up higher in your walk it's time for this bride to go home amen but as you begin to think about this we got all these barriers that the devil likes to put up but I'm here to tell you Satan you're a liar you always were a liar and you've already lost the battle so we're going to preach this morning and tear your kingdom down cuz I'm tired of you trying to hold this body back from moving to the place that God wants her to be the place of a perfect Unity moving in one voice one mind in one Accord a statue of a perfect man on display that the the the the Earth would see this is my bride she is the light of the world it's time for the bride to stand in their position and said it's me he called me he chose me I don't understand at all but I'm going to follow him and I'm going in a Rapture one day you're going to look for me and it's going to be just like Enoch my Ty I'm not going to be here you ain't going to find me cuz I'm in my position next to my God amen glory you love him this morning amen you know I don't know what it is about your past on I know our past has listen I don't know what you grew up in amen some of us grew up in some places that we don't even want to repeat some of the things that happened to us I know some of you got scars but listen I got a scar on my hand it doesn't ident it does identify who I am but it doesn't restrict me come on somebody come on those scars you got on your life we all got them but that doesn't change who you are come on somebody I got a scar right here but that doesn't change who I am it just identifies you ain't going to stop me you ain't going to hurt me it doesn't matter where I come from I know where I'm going I may have been hurt here and I've many heartaches but it's never never never do I quit amen I'm stealing from brother Ron never do I quit why because I'm going to the place that God has called me to and he's not called me to be an Earthbound creature he's called me to the heavens the Heavenly he gave me a message Straight from Heaven to bring me into my position and it's about time we laay down everything that's holding us back [Applause] restricting me amen Revelations chapter 1 I wanted to hit your past this morning I hit it last night but maybe somebody else need to hear that brother Matt how do I do that the same as I lay this down the past is the past can you change it but let me tell you how God sees your past it's clear it's clear there ain't nothing going to hold you back from coming to your position so take every thought that's contrary to what God thinks about you and lay it at the foot of Jesus say father I lay it down this morning I've had I've had some nastiness I've done some stupid things but God says I forgive you come up higher he says it's done what sin how many ever heard that song what sin you begin to talk to the Lord and he's like what are you talking about how many ever heard that story brother down in Louisiana there's a sister came to a prayer line and she was been smoking cigarettes and before she got up the prophet she was scared to death to tell oh he's going to know he's going to know he's going to know and so before she got up there she said Lord forgive me that's right when she came up before the Prophet The Prophet couldn't see it because if it's under the blood there's no seeing your sin there's no seeing your past come on somebody I here I'm going to hear another thing there is people that have done you wrong on you're pting things your parents may have done you wrong but God is healed here to heal that right now he's here to give you healing right now that you won't live in a place of your past come on somebody let's press to the mark of the high calling you got to press through things I can't press for you you can press if the Bible says you can press then let's press moving on you love him this morning Revelations chapter one not what chapter one Revelation chapter 4 I just want to hit that this morning well I believe the Lord want me to hit that just lay it down lay it down forgive it lay it down lay it down we say one time lay it down amen don't let it hinder you from going up higher amen Revelation chapter 4 verse one say I looked and behold a v was open in heaven and the first voice which I had heard as it were a trump from talking with me which said come up hither that voice is still speaking that voice has been calling a bride down Through the Ages come up higher into justification come up higher into sanctification come up higher into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it's still call to a body and it's saying come up higher to the fullness of the word you are my sons and daughters you are the ones that I died for you are the ones that I redeemed you are in that place in my mind and in this day and age the same voice has come down and spoke to you and called your name and told you that is not your place you're not a drunkard you're not a cigarette smoker come on somebody you're not a cussing sailor you are a son and daughter of Jesus Christ and let you the works that I do ye shall do also that's your place this morning that's your place and if there's a thought in your mind from holding you back from that that I say to you this morning don't leave here the way you came but brother Matt how do I deal with it just get in the presence of God you watch how God deal there was a woman one time caught in the very Act of adultery drugg into the presence of God on oh yeah you get in the presence of God and he didn't even even listen to him you got an accuser this morning and you hear that accuser good and well come on somebody you hear that accuser good and well but Jesus didn't listen to him he just stooped down and begin to rewrite a different story you get in the presence of God one time and your story won't be the same there's a different chapter it's not the end of the book he's turning the page this morning and said it might have been that way but let me finish your story and the Finish of your story is glorious Hallelujah adorned Hallelujah in white robes aren't you glad there's still a voice speaking you guys know this let me drop down to verse eight there were four beasts what I want to catch ours and the four beasts had each of them six wings about them they full of eyes within they were rest not day and night saying holy holy Lord God Almighty I missed it let me move up verse seven that's a good verse I like sevens don't you he says and the first Beast was like in a lion the second beast like a a calf the four the the third Beast like face of a man but the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so we know there were four beasts the first three were Earthbound but the last one it denoted that it it didn't just call it a beast but it called it a flying eagle I don't know if you know or not but we're under a flying eagle anointing yeah and when you get under the same anointing you can't help but go flying you know what flying denotes to flying flying denotes action brother B would tell us he said if you weren't repr if you didn't reproduce the book of Acts something is wrong right so I say to you this morning he said take warning if your life doesn't rewrite the book of Acts take warning this morning but I'm here to tell you don't sit there you can write a book of Acts if you get yourself in the presence of God you open your heart and say father write this on the tables of my fleshly heart not a Stony heart listen he's not writing the law like he did back there but he's writing on ones that will let God write upon their heart flying eagle flying eagle come on somebody I don't know about you when I come to church I want to see the book of Acts in motion come on when I come up to a situation all right so you look through the book of Acts I begin to study on the book of Acts you should do that because it identifies who you should be come on somebody I'm not not just talking the Miracles but when they came under persecution it didn't stop them from moving forward in fact it just pushed them together they come under pers persecution they had already had a book of Acts experience in the upper room and they came under persecution and they got together glory to God and they shook the foundation of the building with the presence of God Almighty you need a refilling of the Holy ghost this morning there's a refilling of the Holy Ghost to be had let's shake the foundation this morning let's move it off of his foundation let's have a moving God hallelujah you love him think about an eagle this morning I believe the Eagle's stirring the nest come on somebody the eagle God Almighty is stirring the nest he sends Ministry down in here and challenges you CH he steps on your toes oh yeah your pride still hurt from last night I'm sorry I'm going to heard it again this morning who is that that's doing it cuz I'm sure it's not the first time you heard it from this pull pit I know stubbornness goes right along with pride well I'm gonna preach through it this morning that's all right you come with me or without me if not you get stumped like that I'll know who you are yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how you like that we ain't got time for it come on a got time for your pride come on somebody the only way up is down we ain't got time for it this morning where was I going praise the Lord we'll get back there Eagle stirs in this begins to stir begins to stir how many how many ever go through things where things get uncomfortable job amen n really you like those things things I'm sorry for you I like breathing my own fresh air not the not the air I Just Breathe Right all day long I don't know about you I'm getting pretty uncomfortable here the eagle is stirring the nest you know this mama Eagle would come down and she' begin to they make this nest in such a way that they put fur around it put feathers and you know they kill the rabbit and they make sure they skin it bring it up there and lay it so so everything's nice and comfortable but there comes a time when Mama begins to bring food back as She lays the food down she reaches over and grabs that fur and goes grabs a claw and just throws it out of the nest or as they're eating as they're eating sometimes as you're eating and the preacher talks about Pride it sticks a little bit oh yeah and it begins to get a little uncomfortable and the eagle begins to realize what's the eagle doing Papa Eagle knows you got some potential Papa eagle knows you're not meant just to stay in an S and live with Easy Living Papa Eagle knows it's time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to go flying it's time for you to go soaring it's time for you to recognize all that you can do come on come on somebody this eag will stand over the top of them oh yeah and it'll spread his wings wide what is it it's the opening of the word that's what these preachers are preaching they're preaching the opening of the word that it can identify who you are it's from Genesis to revelation and it's letting know the Little Eagles this is your place this is you who you are you're not you're not one that goes back you're not one that backs away but you're one that takes the very message and goes higher with it brother Brandon fulfilled his job oh yeah come on he preached it with everything he had and he gave it to us but it's time for us to take that message and eat that message and begin to let our lives prophesy again what are we got to prophesy we are them it's me think of the little boy as he looked in the mirror he didn't recognize who he was and I believe a lot of you looked in this message and you thought man that's really good but could that really be me but as you look again my life screams Amen to what it says my life says I identify Lord I want every bit of it the same as Mary said Lord I don't understand how it's going to happen I don't understand it all but God I hear your word this morning there's an angel visitation that came down and all Mary said was be it unto me according to Thy word I don't you know sometimes we don't know how we're going to come up higher but God is here this morning and he's letting you know if you will yield your life if you will lay down your idea if you'll lay down your pride if you'll lay down your past if you'll lay down your future and place it into my hands let me tell you I'm taking you higher in fact I'm bringing you all the way home [Music] hallelu man that Eagles begins to stir her nest she begins to open her wings wide she begins to take those wings of the open book Oh Glory I love that she takes the wings of the open book she gets a man Goda gets a man up there puts him full so full of pressure and all these things gets him so pressurized and he comes out here on the anointing and about all of it comes out I'm telling you I'm a pressure cooker back there I'm going to wear a hole in this carpet it's coming I'm you don't even come on Lord just let me get under that anointing Lord I don't know how I don't even know how this comes together but Lord if I get under that anointing I know you can use a gift and when you use a gift father it does wonders to the people of the Living God Lord I just come before you and God

prophesying over you do not blame me of that if that happens but the bride is happy in the Lord anyway and it really doesn't matter what comes my way today I'm going to wear a smile hold my head up high and say I'm happy in the Lord anyway what example do you have of a man that walks out of that office amen has every right to wear a frown stands up here and says I love you I love you and you know without a shadow of a doubt he means it from the bottom of his heart he has every right to complain come on somebody every right to do it then why do we do it amen thanks of God God has set an example before you so you would know what is pleasing to God Amen I believe it's pleasing to God I believe he even had a vision of brother Brandon looking back over here and his dad and H are looking back over here and saying they were happy at what was going on saints of God listen you're going to go through trials the Eagle's going to stir the nest but that doesn't mean you're not going to your intended place it just means God has a blessing for you that you're getting ready to come through oh my brother b a quote I got so many quotes I can't I can't put them all together but you'll know where I'm looking at and if you need it I'll send it all to you it's yours anyway it's yours anyway amen if God give a man a message ain't no sense in hiding it from him give it to them amen you can

that mother was beginning to root around the nest begin to make everything your job is a mess your home seems like man am I ever going to have I just want to go home from work and have peace amen come on somebody and everything just seems like it's in and up evil brother said he was watching that eagle he goes and those Eagles I'm sure they thought maybe they did something wrong come on that's the first thought that goes through your mind what did I do wrong but if you recognize it's God calling you up higher that's what your Trials come for come on brother M said he said those Eagles don't realize it's a blessing coming Oh Glory saints of God when you are going through a trial right now and maybe you are maybe you're in a dark place feel like Lord I haven't heard your voice Lord I've

line up with the word it's for you to overcome those thoughts and say you know what this trial is my blessing this trial is to change something in my life that I will be more in the character of Jesus Christ this trial is to mold me and shape me come on somebody I don't know where you're at this morning but maybe the presence of God Dro in your heart right now and you look at your trial just a little bit different Trials come in all shapes and sizes and sometimes we don't recognize we're in a trial until we're two weeks in you think you done something wrong and you just keep oh Lord forgive me oh Lord forgive me you listen if you keep repenting Lord forgive you and God doesn't show you anything then that means you may be walking in a trial and God is testing your faith cuz he loves to do that I know we don't like these type of places but it's in those places it's in those places where we really begin to shine it's in those places where we say the right words where we do the right thing where we're pleasing to God how we react matters Glory fresh man brother B said this it isn't me it wasn't the seven Angel no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery of God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his word will fail but we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man catch this now if you haven't fed fully on have word and he tells you why to give yourself strength to fly above every denomination all these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it you've got to take the book for yourself it isn't just for preachers to understand that's right it's for you to come into that personal relationship into your place that's what he's calling you to he said I want some alone time with you you mean more to me than you realize you mean to me I know in your mind you don't think you do but God is telling you you are my bride I loved you so much that I put down my Rob nobody else came and took your place but I myself came and took your place the same as any man of God would stand in the place for his wife he stood there and he said I'm not going to complain about it I want to make sure she doesn't hear one thing that I complain about this I'm not complaining they can rip my beard they can spit in my face but I want her to know when I was on that cross she was on my mind I knew she needed me to take that place and I took her place but now I'm calling her listen I've took your place I've shed the blood I sent the Holy Ghost I gave you the message come into your position come up higher little bride you can live in the

caps he said you the preacher gets great he says I'm closing you know what that means absolutely nothing thank you brother Kenny I love that guy Hebrews chapter 61 it says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine let us go on unto Perfection if Jesus told us be therefore perfect then there's a way to be perfect he shed his blood to cover our sins that's right he sent the holy ghost that we could receive it he gave his name listen he gave all for your iniquities he gave all Lord for your trial he gave it all for you that you could come into your place to this Perfection now when we look at this word perfect I know a lot of us I'm never going to be perfect brother M I just make all kind of mistakes you're looking at the word perfect wrong you're going to make mistakes till the day you leave here everybody [Music] saiden but you also have an advocate with a father you also have a place to go you've got a City of Refuge amen that there ain't no sin no iniquity come on somebody why would God take a or take take Paul who who had killed a man why would he take David who had a man who was in adultery you don't think he's showing you a pattern if your mine there's nothing going to stop you from coming into your place you're predestinated to the adoption of sons and daughters Perfection that word means maturity oh oh I know we say perfect how many know something that's perfect there's only one the Lord Jesus but if that same Spirit be in you it said he Quicken you your mortal body what's happening this morning he's quickening you into Perfection little by little by the spoken word the spoken word comes over you it begins to take effect that's right maturity God's looking for maturity so I'm going to be a real blunt to you quit your whining if you got a 14-year-old kid and they still lay in the middle of the floor and suck on a diaper her suck on a diaper all right that's a Matthew quote suck on a bottle oh Lord have mercy whole service are gone you'll remember that Lord have mercy that one goes down in the archives they're 14 years old laying on the floor still sucking on a bottle something wrong if you're not maturing in Christ something's [Applause] wrong if you're the same place you were three years ago something's wrong because you've heard good word you've been in the right kind of atmosphere but if you're growing you know what you're doing you're growing into full maturity and there's been a light in this hour that was to bring the wheat seed that was to bring the wheat seed to full maturity and we want to go up and when a when a seed gets full what does it do brother it bows his head and what do you hear you hear the combine coming that's right how do you mature a tomato you get a good green tomato man that's going to be a good tomato but you don't e it when it's green unless you like fried fried green tomatoes those are good too but how many likes a good oh I'm on it's getting close to lunch a good beef steak tomato with a side of bacon pork's good but you sisters when you get that tomato what do you do with it when it's green do you stick it under the cupboard do you stick it in the fridge no there's a place you put it it's in the presence of the Su and I don't know if you know it or not but the presence of the S so n is here this morning he's here this morning and you may not feel like you're maturing but I'm here to tell you you are little by little how many's ever visited their cousin that haven't seen in a long while and they got a two-y old and it's been 68 months before you saw him and they've grown so much and you come to the parents like man he's grown so much but the parents don't recognize so much of am because they're with him every day come on somebody you may not recognize that you're growing but you're growing little by little by little you are growing oh man I got to get to this this is off my notes but I've got to come to this story it might take me a minute to find it but you're going to have to wait amen oh I'll get it a minute Lord help me help me find it I just like going everywhere man I story on the rock where that at you know what ah got it I'm going tell you a story real quick said there once was a man asleep one night his cabin was suddenly room filled with light and the Savior appeared to him the Lord had told him he had a work for him to do and showed him a large Rock explained to him to put pushed the rock with all his might this man did in many days he toiled sun up to sun down his shoulders set squarely against the cold massive surface of the rock pushing with all his might each night the man returned to his cabin sore worn out feeling his whole day had been spent in vain seeing that man showed signs of discouragement Satan decided to enter the picture that's where he normally heat oh they're discouraged let me Heap it on them oh yeah you know you never move that rock you know you can never do God's say you don't you don't have the ability to do what God Said you you're just you're just a loser you'll never come to the place that God called you to be you'll never come up higher I know even in this service right here he's trying to tell you that but why don't you to say you know what I'm hearing the word of God and the word of God is calling me higher I didn't call myself but if he's calling me higher he's made a way for me to go higher and if it's a supernatural experience or it's a dayby day walk and I begin to walk up the ladder straight to heaven amen you don't have to sit and listen to that guy identify as him though a lot of our problems we listen to that and we think that's just how it's going to be no that's Satan entered into your mind and he's so slide but once you identify him kick him in the teeth and stomp on his head cuz that's what you're supposed to do serpent bruises right going to bruise his head I'm looking at a generation that are going to take Satan and put him in his place he said these these thoughts discourage and dishearten the man he started to ease up his efforts why kill myself you thought I'll put in my time forth just the minimum effort that'll be good enough o sound familiar I'll just go to church I I'll make it on I'll make it on Saturday I guess and as he did the least planned of doing until one day he decided to take his troubles to the Lord that's a good plan Lord he said I've labored hard and long in your service putting forth all my strength to do that which you've asked yet after all this time I've not budged the rock or even half a millimeter what is wrong why am I failing this is to this to this the Lord compassion responded compassion my friend when long ago I asked you to serve me and you accepted I told you to push against The Rock with all your strength and that have you done but never once did I meant to do that I expected you to move it at least not by yourself your task was to push and now you've come to me your strength spent thinking you failed ready to quit it but is that really look at yourself your arms are strong and muscled your back is seened and brown your hands and cous from constant pressure and your Li your legs have become massive and hard though opposition have grown much and your ability now far surpasses that which you used to have yet still you haven't succeeded in moving the Rock and you come to me now with a heavy heart and your strength spent I my friend will move the rock your calling was to be obedient and push and to exercise your faith and trust in my wisd wisdom and this you have done SS of God just keep pushing against The Rock just keep pushing you are maturing more than you think you are keep pushing against The Rock this is your time God is doing more work in your life than you see yourself you feel discouraged you feel you can't go on you'll feel you'll never get there but I'm here to tell you you're right on [Applause] time thank you Lord for the side note you love him maturity Paul would say this he said one time let me let me read it so I get it when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child God's calling you out of that he's calling for you to quit speaking doubt quit speaking the first thought that comes in your mind run it through the thinking man's filter and be like uh-uh that's not of God it's real simple friends don't make it harder if a thought enters your mind sister as you're washing your clothes I never I'm good enough I can't do that that is not God but but brother Matt I I have those thoughts all the time uhhuh God put let that thought come there so you can get a victory and by the time you get to wash in that next cup maybe your Victory will drop in you say you know what that's not what he said about me he said I was unreprovable he said I was unblamable he said I was going in a Rapture he said he said he said it he said it he said it and I believe it it's time we get to speak in the word it's time we come to full charity listen we've got an open book we ain't looking for any under understanding to come SS of God there ain't no man of God going to raise up and bring you any higher than what God has already brought you come on somebody I had a sister one time she goes oh I just want more I just want more I just want more I said listen there's no more outside of this message so if you're looking for more outside of this message you ain't going to find it this message is the more it's all of it it's all of it it's the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and who you are it's time we come to full maturity SS of God it's time that we start thinking the right thoughts come on somebody keep your who wants to be who I many feels like maybe you're in turmoil thanks for being honest God loves an honest heart sometimes you get in turmoil on your mind but you know the key the Bible says if you keep your mind mind stay on me he will keep you in perfect peace in the places you really shouldn't be in perfect peace just keep your mind stayed on him how do I do that brother Matt listen to this message we have no excuse you've got it right here use a smartphone to give you the right kind of thinking that's right come on you can press play on your Bible too and listen to the word of God that's right come on somebody brother random would teaches he comes where he's invited well invite him to do your car invite him to help him with your test my little girls go to school Daddy I got a test this morning you know what we do we pray same thing Prophet did with his put the message in action SS of God and you watch the peace of God that in an area in a in a world that we live in there's a people with their head held high praising the Lord in spite of all the dark dark nness in spite of bombs being loaded up in spite of everything happening in the government going down the toilet all of it say to God there's a people that said this world is not my home I'm just a passing through there might be some weary days but they ain't going to be weary for me because I know where I'm going they might be hard but I have a God that's made a way and when I get over there it's going to be worth it all you think I danced here you wait till I get over there this is the age of dancing saints of God how do you say that brother Matt let me ask you when did Daniel when did David dance David danced when the word was back in their position then I tell you what don't you let anybody take your dance take your joy you dance because this is the time to dance I don't care what any critic says they don't see the opening of the word but I do and it does something to my feet it does something to my heart it does something to my mouth and I Can't Hold Still In fact when David got a Critic you know what David did it just put fuel to his fire Oh Glory you get a Critic say oh they're just getting a little too loose You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet [Music] cuz one day I'm going to be loose from this body and I'm GNA dance my way all the way have my veil on and I'm gonna meet him in the air let's come to maturity quit your whining you're going to go through things that are hard news flash it's not going to be [Applause] easy that trial put in front of you that obstacle put in front of you is nothing more than a victory that you can hang on your wall Hall the god that help me here is a God that's going to help me here and the god that's helped me here is the same God that was right there and the God that was right there is the same God that was right there and what is it it's trophies of the victories that you have won by the grace of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost taking your land right there is where the Jericho walls fell got your trophy don't you buddy man I I was how about I had a fit back here keep on going buddy don't you give up you fight through everything you got a place in this body amen he didn't call you to lose you he don't care about your past he don't even see it I feel pretty good you love him he said once I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things what was Paul teaching I had to mature and I did come on little bride you're in the presence of the S so n this is the the only place the maturity comes from it doesn't come from any man just preaching it comes from the presence of the S so n and the presence of the S so n steps into the fivefold ministry and the five-fold ministry is brought for what for the perfecting of the Saints that's why the devil doesn't want a five-fold Ministry because he knows that scripture if they just put it to one they won't ever be perfected but there's a people on the Earth that have read their Bible and actually listen to the message of the hour and they're saying Lord I need all five of them I need the teacher I need the evangelist I need the prophet I need a pastor and I need an apostle I want every one of them because under that Ministry there is a maturing of my life to bring my seed to fruit that others can live from it that's what you're meant to do that others can live from your life eternal life is living for others getting the presence of the sun you're sitting in it this morning but this same present goes presence goes with you why don't you start entertainment make him welcome in your home oh yeah if you got to throw things out of your home to make him welcome make him welcome what matters more Your Entertainment I know this ain't a fun subject but it's true I'm still an evangelist you know evangelist is like a Saul they cut and they leave amen sandpaper Pastor comes behind it and Smooths it all out glues it back together God has a a tool belt amen he's got carpentry he's got an evangelist like a saw he's got a pastor like wood glue and sandpaper he's got a prophet like a ladder and a hammer the prophet can go up higher and he sure nailed some things down he's got a teacher it's like a chisel in the teacher I me ever see a chisel work boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom little things little little and then you step back and you're like whoa I didn't realize all that they bring you full circle around and you didn't realize the whole picture man there's some good teachers in this message when they bring it down to you when they bring it down to you it's beautiful isn't it we need them all come on it ain't just a jumping and shouting we need to know who we are and that's with a basis in the word of God you know where you're standing you know where you're born from and you know where you're going Hallelujah speak be a full maturity be able to speak to that mountain they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word a
