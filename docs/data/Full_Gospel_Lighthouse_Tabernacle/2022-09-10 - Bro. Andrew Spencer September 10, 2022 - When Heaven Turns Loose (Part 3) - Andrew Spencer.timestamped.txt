[18:06] this evening we believe all things are
[18:08] possible
[18:08] [Music]
[18:10] foreign
[18:15] gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just
[18:17] thank you for bringing us here this
[18:19] weekend
[18:20] we thank you for the powerful weekend
[18:21] that we had last week and as the lives
[18:24] were changed and I believe the sick were
[18:25] healed it is just up to us to be able to
[18:28] believe it and take it on Lord Jesus and
[18:30] as we take each and every one of these
[18:32] needs unto you we are coming to you
[18:34] because you are a living God the world
[18:36] can have each and every one of their
[18:38] gods whether it be the sport gods or
[18:40] whatever they may believe but we know
[18:42] that we have a message that has been
[18:43] brought forth to us and you sent a
[18:45] prophet that you that he could just
[18:47] speak your word and just have us to
[18:49] believe and that's the only thing that
[18:51] you ask us to do is just to believe your
[18:53] word and I'm looking at a people across
[18:55] the audience here and even across the
[18:57] Airways of the internet that they come
[18:59] to you every weekend they come to you
[19:01] every day in prayer and eating of the
[19:03] word because they believe in a God that
[19:05] can answer every single one of their
[19:07] needs we see the people that we work
[19:09] with and the the ones that are around us
[19:11] that may not even be here among the
[19:13] church they come to us because they know
[19:15] that there is something different about
[19:16] us Lord and though we have different
[19:19] things that we may fight within our own
[19:20] personal life I just ask that tonight we
[19:23] could just draw closer to you we know
[19:25] that we know our own personal battles we
[19:27] know the things that we are dealing with
[19:28] whether it's spiritual whether it's
[19:30] physical no matter what that may be Lord
[19:32] Jesus I ask that you will just come down
[19:34] and search Our Lives just as we heard
[19:36] last week if if the angel could walk by
[19:39] our road if the Holy Ghost could just
[19:41] search Our Lives what what would he find
[19:43] Lord Jesus I just ask it as you anoint
[19:46] the minister of the hour tonight that he
[19:48] may speak and call out anything that we
[19:50] may need to be cleaned out because when
[19:52] that time comes Lord we know that that
[19:54] you are coming for your children and
[19:56] that day is drawing ever close and that
[19:58] cancerous devil he may stick around for
[20:01] as long as he tries to fight but as soon
[20:03] as you call us home Lord Jesus and I'm
[20:05] not calling by the way of the grave but
[20:07] by the way of the Rapture that is so
[20:08] close
[20:09] that demon will he will flee he will be
[20:11] defeated because there is not one demon
[20:13] that will stand in your presence and I
[20:15] believe and as you sweep through the
[20:17] audience tonight that whatever demon is
[20:19] fighting your people the doctors can
[20:21] give it a give it a name we can give it
[20:23] to own our own names that that we may
[20:25] say that we are fighting but we know
[20:27] exactly where it came from and we're we
[20:29] are calling it to go right back to where
[20:30] it came from and that is the hell itself
[20:32] and Lord Jesus I just ask that if there
[20:34] is prodigals out there no matter where
[20:36] they may be there is not one that has
[20:38] gone too far we see the testimonies
[20:40] coming out of the past weekend service
[20:42] and I'm believing that even this weekend
[20:44] Lord Jesus you know the sons and
[20:46] daughters the brothers sisters the moms
[20:48] and dads that are out there that that
[20:50] your children are praying for that you
[20:52] will just sweep across right where they
[20:53] are at and you will speak to their
[20:55] hearts and you will just draw them
[20:56] closer to you allow them to to get into
[20:58] a church somewhere allow them to see
[21:00] exactly what they are needing and that
[21:01] is to be drawn closer to you there is
[21:03] not one thing this world can offer them
[21:05] that you can give them in one instant we
[21:08] just think for what you were doing we we
[21:10] ask you to be with our pastor continue
[21:11] to strengthen him we thank you for
[21:13] giving him the strength that you have
[21:15] given him over the tour last two and a
[21:16] half years but I'm looking for the day
[21:18] that he comes across this this platform
[21:20] and tells us he is cancer free there is
[21:23] not one there is not one moment that I
[21:25] that I pray that we don't pray for that
[21:27] you that you will just come and answer
[21:28] that Lord Jesus and we believe it in
[21:31] Jesus name we pray
[21:32] [Music]
[21:37] amen at this time we're going to receive
[21:39] this evening's offers brother Denny and
[21:41] brother Joshua that would come my sister

[46:02] understatement
[46:03] just to add this in we have
[46:06] we have a family here that has has
[46:08] desired it's no secret that our our
[46:10] Believers that are coming from Durham

[46:49] thank you thank you so much there's so
[46:52] many things that you all have to do
[46:55] that I never want to do
[46:58] and to grab the atmosphere that is in
[47:01] this building
[47:02] and to transfer it onto a stream so that
[47:05] others around the world could be blessed
[47:07] I have had so many compliments and so
[47:10] many things and
[47:11] these brothers these brothers and
[47:14] sisters didn't have a clue what they
[47:15] were doing when they got
[47:17] selected to be placed up there
[47:19] they didn't have a clue how to run
[47:21] cameras they didn't have a clue how to
[47:23] run sound we placed our hands upon them
[47:26] and asked the Lord that he would bless
[47:27] them in it and the reason why we have
[47:30] this today is because there's brothers
[47:32] and sisters that have put their shoulder
[47:34] to the wheel and we're so thankful for
[47:36] each and every one of you the atmosphere
[47:39] the atmosphere that can be felt on the
[47:41] other side that's a very hard thing is
[47:43] to capture on video to capture and
[47:45] people texting me and emailing me and
[47:47] telling me that they felt the atmosphere
[47:49] of the holy spirit in their room and in
[47:51] their kitchen and in their car and it's
[47:53] just an amazing thing to be able to
[47:55] capture that and we know it's not the
[47:57] same but if we can capture just a little
[47:59] bit of what the Lord is doing here with
[48:02] that's we're very thankful but none of
[48:04] this could be done
[48:05] without our pastor brother Ron and we
[48:08] just so appreciate brother Ron with all
[48:10] of our hearts
[48:11] oh man
[48:13] we appreciate you for making all of this
[48:15] possible
[48:21] before we go to uh the word this evening
[48:23] I just last weekend as you know we had
[48:26] had a baptism after the after the
[48:29] meeting there and we're so thankful that
[48:31] we were able to baptize five in the name
[48:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[48:35] remissions of their sins and to see them
[48:37] take on the name of the Lord and to be
[48:39] filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:40] but last weekend I just want to make
[48:43] mention of this you know we baptize we'd
[48:46] baptize a lot of people throughout the
[48:48] years and you'll watch as the spirit of
[48:50] the Lord will will work and they'll
[48:52] they'll get under the anointing but
[48:53] there was not one last weekend as soon
[48:56] as they hit the water or as soon as they
[48:58] were coming down into the water
[49:00] they were filling the atmosphere and
[49:03] every every single one of them you watch
[49:04] as their their countenance change the
[49:07] spirit of the Lord was there
[49:08] Supernatural things were happening we we
[49:11] were able to baptize brother Isaiah
[49:13] Robinson that had just come back to the
[49:15] Lord a prodigal had been away from the
[49:17] Lord sister Khan sister Erica Hensley
[49:19] brother Tyler Chris and then at the end
[49:23] we just fell down
[49:26] felt an unction you know we've already
[49:28] prayed with everybody but we felt
[49:29] deduction to ask is there one more
[49:33] and sister Jenny shifflett I'd had her
[49:36] I'd had her taking pictures for us there
[49:39] and she said brother Andrew you've got

[50:03] the Holy Spirit there
[50:05] that water that was
[50:07] was still water
[50:09] it began to churn and turn and as the
[50:13] angel was in the water and we just

[50:37] anniversary from going through the fire
[50:43] 15 years
[50:46] 15 years Satan swore that he would
[50:48] destroy
[50:51] but it's still standing
[50:54] we've got a God that knows how to go
[50:55] through the fire and get you out on the
[50:57] other side so that he don't even feel or
[51:00] don't even smell the the smell of smoke

[55:43] Revelations chapter 10.
[55:46] Revelations chapter 10 and verse 1.
[55:59] amen
[56:08] Hallelujah
[56:10] I'd like to again
[56:13] I'd like to again speak to you on this
[56:15] thought for the third time on on When
[56:18] Heaven
[56:19] turns loose when Heaven turns loose
[56:22] let's just let's just speak to the
[56:24] author of the word this at this moment
[56:26] father we so fill the atmosphere charged
[56:30] with your Holy Spirit Lord recognizing
[56:33] that your your word is here father as we
[56:37] recognize that Eagles have gathered one
[56:39] more time to to feed on your carcass
[56:42] Lord and we've been reflecting and
[56:44] thinking about the good things of God
[56:46] about all the things that have
[56:48] transpired and it has happened here this
[56:50] past week but father we've come one more
[56:53] time to eat upon the the body of the son
[56:56] of man and father we're asking Lord that
[56:58] you would have control in this service
[57:00] father you'd bless your children
[57:02] according to your riches and Grace
[57:03] father that you'd minister to them on
[57:05] their on their their their lives father
[57:08] and contact them contact their Spirit
[57:10] just now and minister to them who the
[57:13] preaching of the word and Lord may you
[57:15] just come by our way and we'll be
[57:16] careful to serve you in Jesus Christ's
[57:19] name amen
[57:20] well the random said in the events made
[57:23] clear by prophecy he said the Bible
[57:24] foretells by prophecy what day that
[57:28] we're living in and what time we're
[57:30] living and what kind of events
[57:32] ought to be taking place it foretells
[57:34] exactly to the letter and has never
[57:37] missed one age all the time not one time
[57:40] has it ever missed and it won't for you
[57:43] for who are predestinated to see it will
[57:46] see it Jesus said no man come to me
[57:49] except my father draws him and all that
[57:52] the father has given me will come it's
[57:54] the word joining with the word let's say
[57:57] that together it's the word joining with
[58:00] the word it can't do nothing else we
[58:03] know it
[58:04] the day that we're living in Revelations
[58:07] chapter 10 and I saw another Mighty
[58:09] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[58:12] a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[58:14] and his face was as it were the son and
[58:17] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[58:19] in his hand a little book open and he he
[58:22] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[58:24] left foot on the earth and cried with a
[58:27] loud voice as when a lion roared and
[58:29] when he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[58:32] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[58:34] had uttered their voices I was about to
[58:36] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[58:39] saying unto me seal up those things
[58:41] which the seven Thunders had uttered and
[58:44] right them not and the angel which I saw
[58:47] stand upon the sea and upon the Earth
[58:49] lifted up his hand to heaven and swear
[58:53] by him that liveth forever and ever who
[58:55] created heavens and the things that are
[58:58] therein and the earth and the things
[59:00] that are therein are and the Sea and the
[59:02] things which are therein that there
[59:05] should be time no longer but in the days
[59:07] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[59:10] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[59:12] God should be finished as he hath
[59:14] declared to his servants the prophets
[59:16] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[59:19] speak unto me again and said go and take
[59:22] the little book which is closed in the
[59:25] hand of the angel
[59:28] excuse me and take the little book which
[59:31] is open
[59:32] let's say that which is open
[59:35] in the hand of the angel
[59:40] what a day that we're living in which
[59:42] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[59:44] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[59:46] him give me the little book and he said
[59:49] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[59:52] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[59:54] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[59:57] took the little book out of the Angel's
[1:00:00] hand notice who John represents he
[1:00:03] represents the bride and I went unto the
[1:00:06] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:00:08] little book and he said unto me take it
[1:00:10] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[1:00:12] belly bitter and it shall be in thy
[1:00:15] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:00:16] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:00:19] ate it up and it was in my mouth Swedish
[1:00:21] honey and as soon as I had eaten it my
[1:00:24] belly was bitter and he said unto me
[1:00:26] thou must prophesy again before many
[1:00:30] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[1:00:33] Kings may God bless his word he may be
[1:00:36] seated in the presence of the Lord
[1:00:38] as we we just referenced just for a
[1:00:40] moment if you'd flip over just five five
[1:00:43] chapters back you'll find that when John
[1:00:45] is standing there in Revelations chapter
[1:00:47] five not just to read it for time's sake
[1:00:50] but your reference here we reference
[1:00:52] back and we recognize that when when
[1:00:54] John is standing there and John is
[1:00:56] weeping and he's weeping there because
[1:00:58] no man has found the worthy in Heaven
[1:01:00] Nor found in Earth heaven in Earth now
[1:01:03] or no man was worthy to be able to open
[1:01:05] those open the book and the loose the
[1:01:07] seals but there was a voice that came
[1:01:10] out from behind the throne that said
[1:01:12] John weep not for the Lamb of God has
[1:01:16] has come to redeem and to loose those
[1:01:19] seals and look at the hour that we're
[1:01:21] living in where we recognize that we are
[1:01:24] in the hour when the lamb has stood up
[1:01:26] in this hour and we recognize that that
[1:01:29] where we are that heaven has has come
[1:01:32] down to earth and to think that that
[1:01:34] when Jesus was standing there and his
[1:01:36] disciples were asking him teach us how
[1:01:39] to pray and he told he taught them how
[1:01:41] to pray thy will be done on Earth as it
[1:01:45] is in heaven and we recognize that his
[1:01:48] will is being done right now that all of
[1:01:51] Heaven's will is being done on this
[1:01:54] Earth on these Tabernacles where God has
[1:01:56] so pleased to be able to come and dwell
[1:01:59] in a body that to think that God now
[1:02:01] again has a body that he can rest
[1:02:04] himself in that he can lay his head down
[1:02:06] in that he can fellowship with to think
[1:02:09] that that God has a body and to think
[1:02:11] that the hour that we're living in it is
[1:02:14] it is the hour of the revealing of the
[1:02:16] son of man the very the very prophetic
[1:02:19] word that is being revealed in our hour
[1:02:22] and to think that that all of the
[1:02:24] prophets desire to to look that where
[1:02:26] you're looking at and to say that we are
[1:02:28] blessed is an understatement but to
[1:02:30] think that that even Moses desired to
[1:02:33] see God you see you're living in an hour
[1:02:35] that that we recognize if you go on
[1:02:37] reading over in the Book of Revelations
[1:02:39] that you'll find that there is where you
[1:02:42] see Christ in Revelations 1 that you see
[1:02:45] the seven personages of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:48] we're looking at him face to face but
[1:02:50] even the Bible tells us that Moses
[1:02:52] desired to see him and Moses was asking
[1:02:56] God can I see you can I can I look upon
[1:02:58] you and he said no you can't see me but
[1:03:01] I'll hide you over in the clap of The
[1:03:03] Rock and I'll let you see the back part
[1:03:05] I'll let you see my back I'll let you
[1:03:07] I'll let you look at me and as we see
[1:03:10] that when you go to read in the
[1:03:11] scriptures that Moses was hid in the
[1:03:14] clef of The Rock and he's seen as God
[1:03:17] would walk by he's seen the back part of
[1:03:19] God what was he looking at he was
[1:03:21] looking at God's theophany
[1:03:24] you recognize that tonight that God has
[1:03:26] a theophany and you have a theophany and
[1:03:29] to think that under Moses's Ministry
[1:03:31] after he'd come down after God had given
[1:03:34] them the two tablets of stone and he
[1:03:36] come down with the levitical law and he
[1:03:38] come down with the law that God had
[1:03:40] written with his own fingers that the
[1:03:42] Bible tells us that the law that the
[1:03:45] that the ministry of Moses was So
[1:03:47] Glorious that the children of Israel
[1:03:50] could not even behold Moses's face that
[1:03:52] they had to put a veil over Moses's face
[1:03:54] so that they could stand to look upon
[1:03:56] him but you recognize that Paul told us
[1:03:59] that we are not under that Ministry but
[1:04:02] we are under the ministry of
[1:04:04] righteousness and he said if you could
[1:04:05] look back and think that the ministry of
[1:04:08] Moses under that law that law there that
[1:04:10] it was so glorious he said Paul said but
[1:04:13] how much more is the ministry of
[1:04:16] righteousness this glory and to think
[1:04:18] that tonight that his glory came down on
[1:04:21] Mount Sunset and came down and revealed
[1:04:23] to us and told William Brandon to go
[1:04:26] back and to preach the Seven Seals it
[1:04:28] was the same Glory that was up there on
[1:04:30] Mount Sinai it was the same Glory that
[1:04:32] was up there with those with those
[1:04:34] Shepherds up there when there was an
[1:04:36] announcement that the King was coming
[1:04:38] it's the same Glory that's here tonight
[1:04:40] and it's that same Glory that is here
[1:04:42] and to think that where we're living at
[1:04:44] is the greatest hour
[1:04:47] Hallelujah notice what Paul said in
[1:04:50] second Corinthians 3 and verse 13 He
[1:04:52] said not as Moses which put a veil over
[1:04:55] his face he said that the children of
[1:04:57] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[1:04:59] end of that which is abolished but their
[1:05:02] minds were blinded let's say blinded For
[1:05:05] unto this day remaineth the same Veil
[1:05:08] untaken away in the reading of the Old
[1:05:10] Testament which Veil is done away in
[1:05:13] Christ but even under this day when
[1:05:16] Moses is read the veil is over their
[1:05:19] heart say heart
[1:05:21] the veil is over their heart but
[1:05:23] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[1:05:24] Lord the veil shall be taken away now I
[1:05:27] don't have to tell you what the ministry
[1:05:29] of Malachi 4 was to do it was to turn
[1:05:31] the hearts is that right to turn them
[1:05:33] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:05:35] fathers but he said but when the veil is
[1:05:38] upon their heart he said but when it is
[1:05:40] turned
[1:05:41] but when it is turned to the Lord the
[1:05:44] veil shall be taken away so tonight to
[1:05:46] say that you're looking at Jesus Christ
[1:05:48] face to face and the veil has been taken
[1:05:51] away what happened it was the ministry
[1:05:54] of Malachi 4 that turned your heart and
[1:05:57] took the veil off of your heart so that
[1:05:59] you could stand here and you see that
[1:06:01] the son of man is being revealed in this
[1:06:04] hour
[1:06:06] notice what he said verse 17 but where
[1:06:08] now the Lord is that spirit and where
[1:06:11] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:06:13] Liberty but we all with open face
[1:06:16] beholding as in the glass of the glory
[1:06:19] of the Lord are changed into the same
[1:06:21] image from glory to glory even as by the
[1:06:25] spirit of the Lord and to think that our
[1:06:27] heart has been turned tonight
[1:06:31] to think that our heart has been turned
[1:06:33] and to think that you were you were
[1:06:35] walking one way but when the ministry of
[1:06:38] Malachi 4 came your way the veil was
[1:06:41] taken off of your heart and you could
[1:06:43] see him to think that that you were
[1:06:45] blind until this ministry to think that
[1:06:48] you were sitting there with without an
[1:06:49] understanding but the Bible said in
[1:06:52] James chapter 1 he said if any of you
[1:06:54] that lack wisdom let him ask and to
[1:06:57] think that today that God that God
[1:06:59] foresaw you coming that God saw you
[1:07:02] coming and to think that your eyes are
[1:07:04] now open to recognize that there is a
[1:07:07] liberty in the spirit of the Lord
[1:07:09] there's a liberty to see that we're Sons
[1:07:11] there's a liberty to operate like Sons
[1:07:15] I'm gonna tell you you go back and read
[1:07:17] in second Corinthians 3 and then chapter
[1:07:19] four I happen to believe that those are
[1:07:22] some of the most powerful chapters
[1:07:24] throughout the Bible and we could say
[1:07:25] like Paul said that we have this
[1:07:28] treasure
[1:07:30] we have this treasure in Earth and
[1:07:33] vessels this treasure what is it it is
[1:07:36] that of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] to think that it was the veil was taken
[1:07:42] away by the turning by the Turning of
[1:07:44] the heart
[1:07:46] I could say I could stay 10 000 years
[1:07:48] preaching right there on the Turning of
[1:07:50] the heart but you think about the woman
[1:07:52] at the well when her heart began to turn
[1:07:54] what was it it was when the word saw the
[1:07:58] word on the inside of her and he saw
[1:08:00] something valuable on the inside of her
[1:08:02] what was it he was that Jean seed of God
[1:08:05] that he had placed there before the
[1:08:07] foundation of the world and she's just
[1:08:09] out there on another ordinary day just
[1:08:11] another ordinary church service for her
[1:08:13] going out there and getting her bucket
[1:08:15] full of water and going to return back
[1:08:17] to her way of living but this day was
[1:08:20] just more than just another ordinary day
[1:08:22] she was going to meet the word that saw
[1:08:24] the word on the inside of her and she
[1:08:27] began to speak to him and he began to
[1:08:29] contact her spirit he said woman why
[1:08:31] don't you go get your husband she said I
[1:08:33] don't have any he said no you're exactly
[1:08:36] right you've said the truth you've had
[1:08:38] five and the one that you're living with
[1:08:39] is not yours
[1:08:42] he begins she said sir I perceive that
[1:08:45] you are a prophet what was it this
[1:08:48] prostitute this woman of ill Fame this
[1:08:51] woman that didn't have a chance God saw
[1:08:53] something on the inside of her that
[1:08:55] nobody else seen and she dropped her
[1:08:58] water pot because she had representation
[1:09:00] by predestination
[1:09:03] it was that seed that was laying there
[1:09:05] that when the water Struck it it came to
[1:09:08] life
[1:09:10] to think that when that Waters took the
[1:09:13] Pharisees they called it be else above
[1:09:15] but when this water hit the woman at the
[1:09:18] well it brought it to life
[1:09:21] you watches people that turn their face
[1:09:24] towards this but oh Lord we're like
[1:09:26] Peter Lord where would we go
[1:09:29] the water has struck our heart it's
[1:09:32] turned our hearts back
[1:09:35] what is it we have come back to a
[1:09:38] complete circle that this is that that
[1:09:41] was prophesied by the prophet Joel that
[1:09:43] in the last days I'll pour out my spirit
[1:09:45] upon All Flesh
[1:09:47] what was it it was a water that struck
[1:09:50] that seed just like when when Philip
[1:09:52] began to testify to Nathanael he said
[1:09:54] look man we have found him you don't
[1:09:57] mean him oh I mean him the one that our
[1:10:00] Daddy's talked about the one the one
[1:10:03] that our daddy had talked about the one
[1:10:05] that they said would come the one that
[1:10:07] the prophets had prophesied he's here
[1:10:10] Nathaniel said oh no there can't be any
[1:10:13] good thing come out of Nazareth but when
[1:10:15] when Jesus when the Lord saw the word on
[1:10:18] the inside of Nathanael he said in
[1:10:20] Israelite in whom there is no guile
[1:10:24] what was it it was the seed under that
[1:10:28] Wonder getting struck underneath for
[1:10:29] that water what did they have it was
[1:10:32] that seed that was laying there
[1:10:35] to catch the attention what makes you so
[1:10:38] special it's him
[1:10:41] you think about what's happened and
[1:10:43] transpired in your life that's LED you
[1:10:45] here it's him
[1:10:47] it's nothing that you did it was nothing
[1:10:49] that the pastor did it was nothing that
[1:10:51] your mama did it's been the Lord he may
[1:10:54] have used your mom and he may have used
[1:10:55] the pastor but he was the Lord and it
[1:10:57] all it's not I it's not the man that
[1:11:00] works it up it wasn't the prophet he was
[1:11:02] the one Hallelujah
[1:11:04] he was the one that sent Malachi for
[1:11:06] that turned your heart towards this
[1:11:09] ministry without that seed being there
[1:11:11] you'd still be out there but because God
[1:11:15] saw you but for the foundation of the
[1:11:17] world you couldn't stay where you were
[1:11:20] little chicken you are an eagle to begin
[1:11:22] with
[1:11:25] that seed was laying there waiting on
[1:11:28] the water to come
[1:11:31] some of you waited all your life for
[1:11:33] this it was hungering in your heart
[1:11:35] wondering where can it come from where
[1:11:37] can it be but when the water struck
[1:11:41] oh I wish somebody would testify when
[1:11:44] the water struck their life why don't
[1:11:46] you have a testimony service when Satan
[1:11:49] comes around and he tells you you don't
[1:11:51] have it why don't you testify that the
[1:11:54] water struck my heart the water turned
[1:11:56] me the water made me who I am it was him
[1:12:00] that made the seed come to life
[1:12:02] [Applause]
[1:12:06] what's wrong with you what's wrong with
[1:12:09] that group they've been water struck
[1:12:15] this is none other than Jesus what
[1:12:17] brother Banner told us in Christ The
[1:12:19] Mystery of God revealed it's his
[1:12:21] threefold purpose coming down
[1:12:23] he's revealing himself in the in the
[1:12:25] form of the son of man in Luke Luke 17
[1:12:28] 30 Revelations 10 and he's having the
[1:12:32] preeminence in his body his voice is in
[1:12:35] his bride she is the live voice she has
[1:12:38] the voice of Resurrection on the inside
[1:12:39] of her and he said a third poll purpose
[1:12:42] was to restore of the Kingdom what is
[1:12:44] that it's the body change and you
[1:12:47] receive your body change when the last
[1:12:49] one comes in that's why I'm preaching to
[1:12:52] you if there's a water in the rock
[1:12:55] and you're still in speaking distance
[1:12:57] with it I want you to know there's water
[1:13:00] in this rock there's steel that water
[1:13:02] followed Israel everywhere they went
[1:13:05] there's water here tonight and you might
[1:13:08] be the last seed you might be the one
[1:13:10] that we're calling for is there one more
[1:13:12] let the water strike the seed
[1:13:17] oh God let Heaven loose in this place
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:25] it's a powerful thing it's a powerful
[1:13:27] thing when water gets cut loose
[1:13:32] all of you know all of you know you got
[1:13:34] water in your house you don't want it to
[1:13:36] freeze and you don't want it to bust out
[1:13:38] because you're going to have a mess but
[1:13:40] you put that water in the right channel
[1:13:41] it's a real blessing to you you can
[1:13:44] drink from it you can bathe in it
[1:13:46] somebody say hallelujah right there
[1:13:48] but it's a very powerful thing if it's
[1:13:50] in its Channel if you can get that water
[1:13:53] in the channel that it was destined to
[1:13:55] be here it's a powerful thing
[1:13:58] there's there's some power I have some
[1:14:00] powerful storms that are coming across
[1:14:02] this area and they're dropping rain
[1:14:03] which we love which we need these
[1:14:06] farmers are loving all this rain that
[1:14:07] we're getting this summer but rain is a
[1:14:09] very powerful thing it brings life in
[1:14:11] the natural and it brings life in the
[1:14:13] Supernatural it brings life in the
[1:14:15] spiritual if there is no rain in your
[1:14:17] life if there is no water in your life
[1:14:19] then something's been cut off and if
[1:14:22] there's a devil that's cut off your
[1:14:24] water why don't you go to him and tell
[1:14:26] him my Jesus paid the bill cut the water
[1:14:29] back home you can try to shut down the
[1:14:32] channel you can try to shut off the
[1:14:33] water but there
[1:14:35] there is a water that's coming by your
[1:14:38] way and it's going to strike the
[1:14:40] prodigal seed it's going to strike them
[1:14:42] where they are it's the water
[1:14:46] oh let Heaven turn loose
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:52] rain's a very powerful thing
[1:14:55] it had never rained until the days of
[1:14:57] Noah but it rained so much that it
[1:15:00] covered all of the earth 40 days and 40
[1:15:03] nights but could you imagine to think
[1:15:06] that we're sitting here tonight and we
[1:15:08] have the ability by the preaching of the
[1:15:10] word to preach and souls be changed
[1:15:13] Souls come back to the Lord but no one
[1:15:15] was preaching on his ministry and he
[1:15:18] only and he knew that only eight was
[1:15:20] coming only his family was coming but
[1:15:22] for a hundred and twenty years Noah
[1:15:24] preached it's going to rain
[1:15:26] it's going to rain and I don't know who
[1:15:28] he is and I don't know who's not that's
[1:15:30] why I'm preaching to you it's going to
[1:15:32] rain because Dole chapter 2 told us that
[1:15:35] in the latter days I will pour out my
[1:15:37] former rain and I will pour out my
[1:15:39] latter rain the former Reign is the
[1:15:41] teaching grain but the latter rain is a
[1:15:43] harvest rain and brother random told us
[1:15:45] in the church age book that the Harvest
[1:15:47] rain is a rapturing faith and to think
[1:15:49] that this water that you're under
[1:15:53] let the water that you're under is
[1:15:55] giving you rapturing Faith which is more
[1:15:57] than William Branham this is the Angel
[1:15:59] of the Covenant that is standing right
[1:16:01] here to make Joy I know you've been led
[1:16:05] to the water but it's time to drink it's
[1:16:07] not a time to sit there and look at it
[1:16:09] and try to find your reflection it's a
[1:16:12] time to look and drink
[1:16:14] [Applause]
[1:16:16] I'm like David said in Psalms 34 oh
[1:16:19] taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:16:22] I think no one's preaching 120 years
[1:16:25] it's going to rain
[1:16:28] but I got good news for you the Bible
[1:16:30] said in Genesis chapter 8 that the
[1:16:33] heavens were shut up and the rains
[1:16:35] restrained themselves from reigning but
[1:16:37] the rain that you're under it's not
[1:16:39] going to stop raining
[1:16:41] this rain's going to fall on you until
[1:16:44] you have a body change what you are
[1:16:46] experiencing is the Holy Ghost this is
[1:16:49] the latter rain for a lot of people the
[1:16:51] rain is over but for you it's raining
[1:16:54] until
[1:16:55] foreign
[1:16:58] that look at it and say man it ain't
[1:17:00] raining over here let me tell you just
[1:17:01] stick your hands underneath of this
[1:17:03] Cloud one time
[1:17:06] put yourself under the seventh angel one
[1:17:08] time and you'll feel the rain
[1:17:11] you'll feel the rain
[1:17:15] I know exactly where I'm at I'm under
[1:17:18] the ministry of Malachi 4. we are under
[1:17:21] the greatest Cloud movement it's none
[1:17:24] other than our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:17:26] player
[1:17:29] yeah
[1:17:31] yeah it's beginning to rain
[1:17:35] oh look at your neighbor and say it's
[1:17:37] raining it's raining in here brother
[1:17:40] Adam said in the key to the door he said
[1:17:43] therefore I believe in the Full Gospel
[1:17:45] he said every word of God that turns the
[1:17:48] power of God loose that turns his
[1:17:50] blessings to the people it's the key to
[1:17:53] the door that unlocks it now we know we
[1:17:55] go to reading over in Revelations
[1:17:57] chapter 4 that there is a door open that
[1:18:00] no man can shut
[1:18:02] so let me let me just grab your mind
[1:18:04] just for a minute and give you give you
[1:18:06] a little illustration maybe to help
[1:18:07] these little kids we got a little door
[1:18:09] right here we got a door that's standing
[1:18:11] right here and his name is Jesus
[1:18:14] and on the other side of that door is
[1:18:16] your blessings it's your healing it's
[1:18:19] your Miracle it's everything that you
[1:18:21] prayed for it's your deliverance it's
[1:18:24] your breakthrough
[1:18:26] freedom from depression freedom from
[1:18:29] anxiety freedom from back pain freedom
[1:18:31] from eye trouble freedom from
[1:18:33] circumstances is on the other side of
[1:18:36] this door
[1:18:38] what did Jesus tell us in John chapter
[1:18:40] 10 I am the way the truth and the life I
[1:18:44] am the door to the Sheepfold on the
[1:18:46] other side of this door
[1:18:48] on the other side of this door is
[1:18:51] everything that you have need of
[1:18:54] now just give me give me just a little
[1:18:57] bit of Liberty right here
[1:19:01] but brother random said it's the Full
[1:19:02] Gospel that unlocks the door so what is
[1:19:05] it this is before the seals were ever
[1:19:07] released and he's telling us it's the
[1:19:09] Full Gospel that is the key to the door
[1:19:12] so what do we do to open the door to
[1:19:14] these blessings we take the opening of
[1:19:16] the word and we open the blessings
[1:19:21] can I get on the other side of this door
[1:19:23] real quick
[1:19:25] you look good with your Miracle on you
[1:19:27] you look good with your blessing on you
[1:19:29] you look good with your prodigal sitting
[1:19:31] beside you you look good delivered you
[1:19:34] look good set free
[1:19:36] what was it it was the opening of the
[1:19:39] word that brought your Miracle by your
[1:19:42] way
[1:19:44] oh I wish I wish I had time to preach
[1:19:47] this but let me let me say this this
[1:19:49] door is open and hail itself can't shut
[1:19:52] it
[1:19:54] foreign
[1:19:56] [Applause]
[1:20:00] that's telling you that you're not going
[1:20:02] to get it that's telling you that your
[1:20:04] Miracle ain't your own your way that's
[1:20:06] telling you that you're going to be the
[1:20:07] only one in your family why don't you
[1:20:09] stop that devil right in the face said
[1:20:12] this is my inheritance this is my
[1:20:14] blessing this is my anointing everything
[1:20:17] that I have need of was locked up on the
[1:20:19] inside of almighty God and he loosed
[1:20:22] himself
[1:20:24] loosed himself
[1:20:32] ah
[1:20:35] brother Branham goes in 1956 and
[1:20:38] preaches he preaches a junction of time
[1:20:40] and he tells us that at a junction
[1:20:42] Angels appear prophets arise signs and
[1:20:45] wonders were done at a junction and to
[1:20:49] think that his angels are here
[1:20:52] the miraculous is here
[1:20:55] laughs how many is a miracle to be in
[1:20:57] the building
[1:20:59] now we've already know that the Bible
[1:21:01] tells us in Psalm 34 that his angels are
[1:21:03] going to keep he's going to keep he's
[1:21:05] going to encamp about you so we know his
[1:21:07] angels are here you've proven that as
[1:21:09] miraculous as here we've laid our hands
[1:21:11] on a sick and they've recovered what is
[1:21:14] it doing it's proving that he is the
[1:21:17] omnipotent one but he also tells us in
[1:21:19] the junction of time that counterfeits
[1:21:21] our eyes now what is a junction brother
[1:21:24] Bynum goes in he he spends a lot of time
[1:21:26] in 1956 and you'll hear him because of
[1:21:28] that because of that sermon you'll hear
[1:21:31] him grab from those seven sermons and he
[1:21:33] preached it all the way until his death
[1:21:35] that there is a junction and a junction
[1:21:38] is it is a changing over on the road
[1:21:42] it's a blending between two Roach
[1:21:45] it's a blending you're at a junction and
[1:21:48] you you got to make a decision you're at
[1:21:50] a junction whether you turn light turn
[1:21:52] left turn right you're at the blending
[1:21:54] and here we are we're standing right
[1:21:56] here at the blending of time and the
[1:21:58] blending of Eternity
[1:22:01] but notice the omnipotence is always
[1:22:03] there at a junction and you go back and
[1:22:06] you study out that that message on the
[1:22:08] junction of time brother Brandon ain't
[1:22:09] got time to go through it my brother
[1:22:10] Branham goes in there and he lays out
[1:22:12] seven major Junctions that happen
[1:22:14] throughout the Bible and to think when
[1:22:17] brother random comes here he tells us he
[1:22:19] said it takes the miraculous to speak of
[1:22:22] omnipotence
[1:22:25] who raised their hand said to your
[1:22:27] Miracle to be here
[1:22:28] it takes the miraculous to speak of the
[1:22:31] omnipotence
[1:22:32] now hold that in your heart he's he said
[1:22:34] now omnipotence is the all-powerful and
[1:22:36] it takes the miraculous to vindicate the
[1:22:38] omnipotence and only the miraculous can
[1:22:40] do that he said teaching of the word is
[1:22:42] a very fine thing he said faith comes by
[1:22:45] hearing and hearing the word he said but
[1:22:47] it always takes the miraculous to
[1:22:50] vindicate the omnipotence still lives
[1:22:52] and he still Reigns he said we must have
[1:22:55] the miraculous and I believe that the
[1:22:57] church is now standing on the greatest
[1:22:59] on a threshold of the greatest
[1:23:01] Vindication of the omnipotence that the
[1:23:04] world has ever known and there ever has
[1:23:06] been and to think that when William
[1:23:08] Branham is preaching that in 1956 he's
[1:23:12] looking into your day
[1:23:14] he's looking into a day when the seals
[1:23:17] have been released that the church is
[1:23:19] not just waiting but the church is now
[1:23:22] here on the threshold
[1:23:25] of the greatest Vindication of the
[1:23:27] miraculous that's ever been done
[1:23:31] brother went on to tell us he said Moses
[1:23:34] before God ever liberated before he ever
[1:23:38] liberated Israel from Egypt he showed
[1:23:40] that he had the supernatural
[1:23:43] I was reading the other day brother
[1:23:45] Brandon
[1:23:47] when brother Bynum is standing there
[1:23:49] and he and he breaks into heaven
[1:23:52] and he breaks in on a conversation
[1:23:55] but here's my deliverer down here in
[1:23:57] Egypt
[1:23:58] he's just a little baby Pharaoh's trying
[1:24:01] to kill him everybody there everybody's
[1:24:03] trying to kill every two-year-old son
[1:24:05] I'm blow trying to kill out the Messiah
[1:24:08] trying to kill out the deliverer is that
[1:24:10] right and and God and brother Bynum goes
[1:24:13] in there and breaks into a conversation
[1:24:14] and he goes up there and he tells the
[1:24:17] porters of Heaven he goes in there and
[1:24:19] tells those angels you get down there on
[1:24:21] that Riverbank you get on that Riverbank
[1:24:24] and you tell you tell every crocodile
[1:24:26] you step on him if a wood comes if a
[1:24:28] piece of wood floating wood comes near
[1:24:30] it push it away and brother random said
[1:24:33] one of the Angel asked him
[1:24:36] where are you going to be at Lord he
[1:24:38] said don't you worry I'm going to be at
[1:24:40] the receiving end when Moses gets to his
[1:24:43] destination I'm going to be there
[1:24:46] let me tell you when you get to your
[1:24:48] destination you're not going to be
[1:24:50] disappointed he's already at the
[1:24:52] receiving end everything Hallelujah
[1:24:55] everything you have neither Jesus is at
[1:24:58] the receiving end
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:03] I know somebody's catching a prophecy
[1:25:06] right here you are going to meet that
[1:25:09] one that loved you before time began
[1:25:12] he's at the receiving end
[1:25:16] oh I think I'm just about speaking
[1:25:18] tongues the rest of the night but I got
[1:25:19] to preach to you for a moment
[1:25:21] but the miraculous is always done
[1:25:24] the miraculous is always done in a
[1:25:26] junction
[1:25:27] and when David when David was walking
[1:25:30] out there
[1:25:32] oh just another ordinary day
[1:25:37] just another ordinary day 12 miles from
[1:25:40] his household
[1:25:41] 12 miles from Bethlehem and he goes to
[1:25:43] the valley of Eli and he hears a
[1:25:46] disturbing sound he's here's a
[1:25:49] disturbing sound of a devil defying the
[1:25:52] armies of the Living God
[1:25:55] it was just an ordinary day
[1:25:58] David didn't come out there to be no
[1:26:00] national hero he was simply under the
[1:26:03] leadership of his father going out there
[1:26:05] to check on the welfare
[1:26:07] of his Brethren and see how they were
[1:26:10] doing taking them some cakes out there
[1:26:15] I tell you what I wouldn't mind being
[1:26:17] for him to David
[1:26:20] I like cake so you know anyway let me
[1:26:22] get back to preaching
[1:26:26] I'm telling you it's going to be good
[1:26:28] tonight
[1:26:31] he didn't go out there to be just
[1:26:32] another he didn't go out there to be a
[1:26:34] national hero but he walked out there
[1:26:36] and David understood that there was a
[1:26:40] reward for victory and he asked what
[1:26:42] shall be given to the man that wins this
[1:26:45] victory for Israel and they screamed out
[1:26:47] Saul's daughter is going to be given to
[1:26:49] the man that takes down this champion
[1:26:51] and I know we've preached every side of
[1:26:53] David and Goliath we preached every
[1:26:55] single thing but I'm sitting in my study
[1:26:56] today and a thought dropped in my heart
[1:26:58] wonder what goliath was thinking that
[1:27:01] day
[1:27:03] I wonder what the what was going through
[1:27:06] Goliath's mind it's just another day
[1:27:08] brother Ron said he got up and he ate 40
[1:27:10] eggs that morning had his trim Healthy
[1:27:13] Mama I had as all all of his shakes and
[1:27:15] everything
[1:27:16] but I wonder what was going through
[1:27:19] Goliath's mind
[1:27:21] it's going to be a good day for me
[1:27:23] just another battle just another victory
[1:27:26] for the Philistines
[1:27:29] who's that little scrawny looking punk
[1:27:31] out there he ain't gonna be nothing I'll
[1:27:33] hang him on my spear tonight and we'll
[1:27:35] watch the crows we'll watch the buzzards
[1:27:37] come down who's that little thing out
[1:27:39] there I ain't got to worry about him
[1:27:40] he's so little I can't even I can't
[1:27:42] hardly see him I've got to look I've got
[1:27:44] to look and I've got to put on my
[1:27:46] bifocals just to see that little scrawny
[1:27:48] looking thing I wonder what was really
[1:27:50] going through his mind brother Fred when
[1:27:52] he looked on this David so oh no I got
[1:27:55] that one by pornography I've got that
[1:27:58] one by Pride I've got that one by
[1:28:00] anxiety I've got that one they're not
[1:28:02] they're not going to get anything out of
[1:28:03] the service I've got their minds so
[1:28:05] wrapped up on fixing their lawnmower and
[1:28:07] their weed eater I've got them so much
[1:28:09] they they're not going to be anything in
[1:28:11] this service
[1:28:13] I I wonder what he was thinking as he
[1:28:16] got out there and David started picking
[1:28:19] up Jesus on his way to the fight he
[1:28:21] starts picking up Faith on the weight of
[1:28:23] his fight now I know that I know that
[1:28:26] you know this but you hear it before you
[1:28:28] ever see it and before Goliath ever seen
[1:28:31] a rock coming out of that sling he heard
[1:28:34] a noise
[1:28:35] he heard a noise now I know I know I've
[1:28:38] told you this before but when we as
[1:28:40] little boys we lived right there in
[1:28:42] Pilot Virginia and those fighter jets
[1:28:44] would come flying over top of our
[1:28:46] household and you could hear them before
[1:28:47] they ever got there and we'd run through
[1:28:49] teeny's house all of us boys running
[1:28:51] through there like Bulls in a china shop
[1:28:53] tearing everything up just to get out
[1:28:55] there and who was leading us none other
[1:28:57] than teeny getting out there to see
[1:28:59] those Fighters that's going over you
[1:29:00] could hear them about 10 to 15 seconds
[1:29:03] before you ever seen them
[1:29:05] you heard it before you see it and to
[1:29:08] think that Goliath heard this sling
[1:29:10] going round and round and round and
[1:29:13] round before he ever seen that rock
[1:29:15] coming at his head I'd say that the same
[1:29:18] one that stood there and said who is
[1:29:20] this little runny thing that's standing
[1:29:22] out here before me that same Satan is
[1:29:24] standing up here let's grab his thoughts
[1:29:26] just for a minute I'd say Goliath was
[1:29:29] thinking oh snap I have chose the wrong
[1:29:31] battle today
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:35] wait a minute I've seen them people
[1:29:37] before they know how to use a rocker
[1:29:40] Revelation it's a time to start thinking
[1:29:43] about what Satan thinks about you oh
[1:29:45] snap hell messed up you chose our own
[1:29:49] battle you chose our own people
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:54] brother Branham told us in the adoption
[1:29:57] series he said there's coming a time
[1:29:58] when the sons of God will walk out there
[1:30:01] and take the power away from Satan and
[1:30:04] is this hour in the manifestation of the
[1:30:07] sons of God when we take the very power
[1:30:09] of anxiety away from the devil take
[1:30:12] blood pressure problems away from the
[1:30:14] devil take sugar diabetes away from the
[1:30:16] devil it's time that you rise up under
[1:30:19] the message of Malachi 4 and Ascend to
[1:30:22] higher Heights Christ descended so that
[1:30:25] you could ascend
[1:30:30] it's time to think what he thinks about
[1:30:33] you
[1:30:37] you see David knew
[1:30:40] that there was a reward coming
[1:30:44] if you don't give up you got a reward
[1:30:46] coming
[1:30:47] if you'll press the battle you got a
[1:30:49] reward coming
[1:30:51] if you don't give up Heaven is yours
[1:30:54] if you don't stop praying everything you
[1:30:56] ask for in Jesus name will come
[1:30:58] if you'll surrender the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:00] yours
[1:31:02] if you don't give up Heaven is yours
[1:31:04] if you'll fight if you'll battle and
[1:31:07] just get scarred up for the kingdom
[1:31:08] you'll take a ride in the Chariot with
[1:31:10] the King
[1:31:15] notice
[1:31:17] Miller Brown tells us
[1:31:20] he tells us
[1:31:22] he said you look at the tomorrow in this
[1:31:23] age
[1:31:24] it took a look at all the evil spirits
[1:31:26] and everything that's going on in the
[1:31:28] morale of the people people becoming
[1:31:30] more and more desensitized to the moving
[1:31:32] of God
[1:31:34] brother Brandon said now look he said
[1:31:37] when all hell is turned loose
[1:31:39] all Heaven turns loose
[1:31:43] when brother Madam says that he goes and
[1:31:44] he breaks into Isaiah 59 and 19 that
[1:31:47] when the enemy comes in like a flood God
[1:31:49] will raise up a standard
[1:31:51] what is it it's God responding to the
[1:31:54] need just like when Nimrod was up there
[1:31:57] under that Confederation and causing
[1:31:58] confusion at Babylon he had a man down
[1:32:01] there that was blameless
[1:32:03] and his name meant dedicated he lived a
[1:32:07] life he was so close to God that he
[1:32:09] walked With God all the days of his life
[1:32:13] that he lived so close to God what was
[1:32:16] it all hell was being turned loose but
[1:32:18] all heaven was being turned loose and
[1:32:21] Enoch was walking so close to God that
[1:32:24] God said I can't leave him
[1:32:26] I can't leave him you study out his name
[1:32:29] his name means dedicated he was
[1:32:31] dedicated whether his wife was serving
[1:32:33] God or not he was dedicated whether his
[1:32:36] health was going good or whether it
[1:32:38] wasn't he was dedicated to the cause of
[1:32:40] walking with that same one that Abraham
[1:32:44] was fellowshipping with up there
[1:32:46] and to think that out of Junction Angels
[1:32:49] appear
[1:32:54] think about when brother Brown starts
[1:32:56] talking about
[1:32:57] thinking on your way
[1:33:01] that Mary began to think on her way
[1:33:05] just another ordinary day
[1:33:07] maybe I should have titled it that just
[1:33:09] in order their Ordinary Day
[1:33:12] just another ordinary walk
[1:33:14] ing down the same streets that she'd
[1:33:17] walk down before
[1:33:19] but brother Branham said that she was
[1:33:20] thinking about Isaiah's prophecy
[1:33:23] and it's when you go to talking about
[1:33:25] God is when God shows up
[1:33:28] what happened over in Luke 24 is those
[1:33:31] disciples on that Emmaus walk they got
[1:33:33] to talking about him
[1:33:34] and that's when he draws an ear but here
[1:33:37] as Mary is walking as Mary is is
[1:33:41] reflecting over Isaiah's prophecy and
[1:33:44] brother Adam tells us that they'd heard
[1:33:46] Joseph and Mary had heard the priests
[1:33:48] read that day over in Isaiah that a
[1:33:51] virgin shall conceive and bring forth a
[1:33:54] child and you'll call his name Emmanuel
[1:33:56] which is being interpreted God With Us
[1:33:59] and brother Madam said that Mary was
[1:34:01] thinking about this and there was a
[1:34:04] flicker of light in the street and she
[1:34:06] thought wow the stars are a little bit
[1:34:08] closer tonight they're moving down just
[1:34:11] a little bit and out out of that flicker
[1:34:13] of light stepped a six-foot man with
[1:34:17] long hair about down to the shoulders
[1:34:19] Joe down to his shoulders and said Mary
[1:34:24] Mary Thou Art highly favored
[1:34:27] to think
[1:34:30] to think
[1:34:34] Mary
[1:34:35] you're the one
[1:34:38] Mary you're the one that Isaiah talked
[1:34:41] about Mary you're the one
[1:34:45] [Music]
[1:34:47] could you imagine you're the one that
[1:34:49] Isaiah talked about you're the one that
[1:34:51] Isaiah seeing what was it it was Mary
[1:34:55] fulfilling prophecy that was laying
[1:34:57] there
[1:34:59] could you imagine is all the angels in
[1:35:02] heaven are gathered around the corridors
[1:35:04] it's time
[1:35:06] it's time that I elect My Flesh My Flesh
[1:35:10] that I elected is now going to bring
[1:35:12] forth the one that is going to be called
[1:35:14] Jesus and he's going to save his people
[1:35:17] from their sins it's time
[1:35:26] notice the harmony that is to exist
[1:35:30] between the bride and the bridegroom
[1:35:33] she knows what he wants done with the
[1:35:35] word she has thus say of the Lord she
[1:35:38] speaks only his word she only says what
[1:35:41] he says she either says what he says or
[1:35:44] she sets steal
[1:35:46] do you imagine as all the angels are
[1:35:48] gathered as are watching this prophecy
[1:35:51] come to fulfillment and marry but can
[1:35:53] you imagine all of Heaven all of the
[1:35:56] Saints from out the ages as they're
[1:35:58] looking over
[1:36:03] this is she
[1:36:07] this is she this is the one we waited on
[1:36:10] this is the one that God for ordained
[1:36:14] Brad you're the one
[1:36:17] You're the One You're The Prophet's
[1:36:19] prophecy you're going to fulfill it
[1:36:24] you're gonna fulfill Malachi 4 said
[1:36:26] about you you'll be both of his bone
[1:36:28] life of his life power of his power
[1:36:35] Lorena said no he said dominance is
[1:36:38] speaking
[1:36:39] angels are appearing prophets are coming
[1:36:42] prophets are prophesying Visions are
[1:36:45] being poured out upon the people of this
[1:36:46] day the gospel is being preached the
[1:36:49] sick is being raised up the blind see
[1:36:51] the death here devils are raging
[1:36:53] impersonators Janice and Jammers are
[1:36:55] here but omnipotent speaks Hallelujah we
[1:36:59] are in the last day we're at the
[1:37:01] junction
[1:37:04] she's here
[1:37:05] you've arrived made Made Alive by the
[1:37:09] same quickening power
[1:37:12] laughs
[1:37:13] that Abraham met with
[1:37:18] the one that Abraham had been
[1:37:20] fellowshipping with
[1:37:22] and to think that the voice that Abraham
[1:37:24] had heard all those days
[1:37:28] led him to this moment
[1:37:32] you think about how you got here
[1:37:36] if you watch the Gathering of people and
[1:37:37] you watch the Gathering of this bride
[1:37:39] you begin to think about how did you get
[1:37:41] here
[1:37:42] not just talking about here but talking
[1:37:44] about to the message you think about you
[1:37:46] think about it
[1:37:48] what was it brother Brown said
[1:37:50] The Voice led him to this he said but
[1:37:53] why didn't Melchizedek come to him and
[1:37:54] who is this melchized he said why did
[1:37:56] Melchizedek come to Abraham he said
[1:37:58] because he was the one that had the
[1:37:59] promise
[1:38:03] I'm gonna tell you God Melchizedek
[1:38:05] didn't show up down at the church of
[1:38:06] Christ because they didn't have the
[1:38:07] promise I don't mean this in no
[1:38:09] disregard they didn't show up down to
[1:38:11] the Baptist Church because they didn't
[1:38:12] have the promise but there is a promise
[1:38:15] of a people that are sitting here under
[1:38:17] the ministry of Malachi 4 as John the
[1:38:21] Baptist was foreign the first coming to
[1:38:23] reform on the First Command of Christ so
[1:38:25] were William branham's message forerun
[1:38:27] the second coming of Christ and to think
[1:38:29] that you are here because there's a
[1:38:31] promise that you're going to bring forth
[1:38:33] a son and brother banham told us and who
[1:38:35] is a Melchizedek he said we'll take if
[1:38:37] you've died and you went on to your
[1:38:39] theophany you'll take this theophany go
[1:38:43] to meet your redeemed body
[1:38:45] your feet off and he will come and get
[1:38:48] this redeemed body he said but if you're
[1:38:50] here you'll take this redeemed body to
[1:38:53] meet that theophany
[1:38:56] oh one of this morning to look for me
[1:38:58] you're gonna look and I'm gonna be gone
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:05] what was it the fellowship it wasn't
[1:39:08] just communion it wasn't just eating but
[1:39:10] it was a fellowship with Melchizedek and
[1:39:13] this Fellowship was changing Abraham's
[1:39:16] cells
[1:39:20] started thinking he started thinking
[1:39:22] like a young man
[1:39:24] he started acting like a young man
[1:39:25] because his sails of his body were
[1:39:28] changing what was it brother Branham
[1:39:30] said that this word would put Sail on
[1:39:33] top of sail sail on top of sail and one
[1:39:36] of these mornings between the hours of
[1:39:37] six and nine
[1:39:44] what did Paul tell us in second
[1:39:46] Corinthians 5 that if this Earthly
[1:39:48] Tabernacle be dissolved we have all one
[1:39:51] already waiting for us in heaven so you
[1:39:53] destroy this body and I've got a
[1:39:55] theophany already waiting on me you can
[1:39:58] kill me you can put me in a car wreck
[1:39:59] you can throw me in all kinds of trouble
[1:40:01] but I've got a theophany waiting on me
[1:40:03] that theophany is the real you do you
[1:40:07] recognize God had a theophany and you
[1:40:09] couldn't kill it
[1:40:11] and your theophany is the real you
[1:40:15] what was it it's the word seeing the
[1:40:17] word
[1:40:20] I I ain't got enough I ain't got enough
[1:40:23] preacher on the inside of me to preach
[1:40:24] to you the way I want to preach this
[1:40:25] tonight
[1:40:27] but when when Jesus is walking on the
[1:40:30] Emmaus Road with his two disciples he's
[1:40:32] walking down there the Bible tells us he
[1:40:35] began to talk to them about the
[1:40:37] scriptures concerning himself what was
[1:40:40] he doing he was showing them modern
[1:40:42] events made clear by prophecy and
[1:40:45] brother Bradley I think it's amazing
[1:40:47] brother bandham goes all the way back
[1:40:49] there 2 000 years ago and breaks into
[1:40:51] their conversation and he has a six-hour
[1:40:54] sermon with them on Prophecy
[1:41:00] you see Tom
[1:41:03] is no limit when you're walking with him
[1:41:07] things stand still when you're walking
[1:41:08] with Melchizedek
[1:41:15] he's been at this for about 45 minutes
[1:41:18] but if we keep walking we might walk
[1:41:20] right into a rapture
[1:41:23] ah he can't be going much longer he
[1:41:25] typically goes about an hour hour and
[1:41:28] five minutes if he gets a little
[1:41:29] long-winded it gets a button sometimes
[1:41:31] but one of these days
[1:41:32] one of these days one of these days one
[1:41:36] of these days you're going to take a
[1:41:37] walk and he's going to talk to you about
[1:41:40] who you were down here on Earth he's
[1:41:42] going to talk about talk to you about
[1:41:43] how powerful you are he's going to talk
[1:41:45] to you and tell you you were the ones
[1:41:47] that led them the ones that didn't have
[1:41:49] hope they looked at your life
[1:41:52] the ones that almost gave up they looked
[1:41:55] at your life
[1:41:56] but because of your walk
[1:42:01] this one's here
[1:42:03] that one's here this one's here that
[1:42:06] one's here my brother's here my sister's
[1:42:08] here because of your walk
[1:42:11] brother Burnham said he goes in there
[1:42:14] and he starts breaking down prophecy and
[1:42:16] pulling out prophecy and showing them
[1:42:20] who they were walking with
[1:42:23] he said he goes in there in Zechariah 11
[1:42:25] and 12 and shows him that the Messiah
[1:42:27] was going to be sold for 30 pieces of
[1:42:29] silver he breaks into Psalms 41 and 9
[1:42:31] and shows that he would be betrayed of
[1:42:33] his friends Psalms 35 and 11 he was
[1:42:36] accused by false Witnesses Zechariah 13
[1:42:39] and 6 through 7 that he would be
[1:42:41] forsaken by his friends and his
[1:42:42] disciples Isaiah 53 and 7 that he would
[1:42:45] be done before his accusers Isaiah 50
[1:42:48] and 6 he would be scourged by them
[1:42:50] Isaiah or Psalms 22 why hast Thou
[1:42:53] forsaken me Isaiah 53 and 12 that he
[1:42:56] would die between malefactures he was
[1:42:59] showing them who he was
[1:43:04] what was he doing
[1:43:05] he was taking prophecy and showing that
[1:43:08] it was once history but now it was a
[1:43:10] reality
[1:43:18] the Bible tells us in Hebrews 7 and 2
[1:43:21] that he's a king of peace
[1:43:23] and he's a king of righteousness
[1:43:28] who was Abraham fellowshipping with the
[1:43:31] king of peace
[1:43:33] and brother Branham goes in there and he
[1:43:35] breaks into the king of righteousness
[1:43:36] and he said it is a spirit attribute he
[1:43:39] goes into there and says king of Peace
[1:43:40] he is theophany he said but there's one
[1:43:43] more King he said when he took on flesh
[1:43:46] and he raised this flesh back up again
[1:43:48] he said then he was King of Kings when
[1:43:52] he raised this body up he became king of
[1:43:56] kings
[1:43:57] and to think that tonight the brother
[1:43:59] Brian I'm standing there and who is this
[1:44:00] Melchizedek in 1965 he said it's King
[1:44:03] god king righteousness and King
[1:44:05] theophany you're not just walking with
[1:44:08] anybody tonight Church you're walking
[1:44:10] with the Great I Am you're walking with
[1:44:13] King theophany
[1:44:17] all right
[1:44:20] it's too high that we can't take it but
[1:44:22] to think that tonight that when he
[1:44:24] decided to speak to you he was speaking
[1:44:27] to you about your theophany the
[1:44:29] theophany is your real you
[1:44:34] this ain't about the flesh it's about
[1:44:36] the real you
[1:44:38] it's about you it's about the gene seed
[1:44:40] of God
[1:44:50] brother randoms up there in Colorado
[1:44:52] Mountain
[1:44:53] and he's hunting with those Brothers
[1:44:56] he's something with those brothers and
[1:44:58] he tells them they're calling for a
[1:45:00] blizzard
[1:45:00] they call him for a blizzard and he said
[1:45:02] now first sign
[1:45:03] they'd have made a pack and the first
[1:45:05] sign of snow we got to get back down to
[1:45:06] camp we got to get out of here but they
[1:45:08] wanted to stay they wanted to stay there
[1:45:10] and brother Brandon you know you know
[1:45:12] the story so well but I just want to
[1:45:13] take just a moment go right here
[1:45:17] that he's up there
[1:45:18] and he knows what he's told those boys
[1:45:21] he knows what he's told them up there
[1:45:25] get back down
[1:45:27] it starts sleeping it starts snowing and
[1:45:29] the wind starts coming down through and
[1:45:30] it's blowing he said it's so thick that
[1:45:32] he can't hardly see where he's at but
[1:45:34] there was a voice
[1:45:36] I said turn and go back where you came
[1:45:38] from
[1:45:41] turn and go back where you came from man
[1:45:44] it died in storms like that
[1:45:46] but he starts walking
[1:45:48] and listening to The Voice
[1:45:50] the reason why you're here is because
[1:45:52] you listened to the voice
[1:45:59] and you remember when he gets up there
[1:46:00] and he's sitting there
[1:46:05] and he said I am the Lord
[1:46:07] the ones that made the winds and the
[1:46:10] Seas and he jerked off his head
[1:46:13] I'm the one that created this created
[1:46:16] these things that created the winds or
[1:46:17] created these things I'm the one that
[1:46:19] told you to create those squirrels I'm
[1:46:21] the one that told you all of these
[1:46:22] things I am the one he said speak to the
[1:46:26] storm and it'll obey you
[1:46:28] he said you watch every voice he said if
[1:46:31] it leads you contrary to the word leave
[1:46:33] it alone he said but I spoke to the
[1:46:36] Witch and I spoke to the said God spoke
[1:46:38] to those storms and he said storm stop
[1:46:42] and when you cease and son you shine
[1:46:45] until we leave here what was it it was
[1:46:48] God in creation again speaking
[1:46:53] he was a Creator working through
[1:46:56] creation it was a word speaking of the
[1:46:59] word
[1:47:02] and I said something strange happened
[1:47:04] the neighboring cities they said
[1:47:05] something strange happened there was a
[1:47:06] blizzard coming but it all of a sudden
[1:47:08] just stopped
[1:47:10] brother said there come a wind down
[1:47:12] through here
[1:47:15] and it completely stopped he said the
[1:47:17] leaves had completely dried up where it
[1:47:19] had been raining on them and sleeting on
[1:47:21] them
[1:47:22] and he said I started to go on he said I
[1:47:24] put my shot my gold my gun around my
[1:47:27] shoulder and I started to walk
[1:47:29] and he said I Heard a Voice
[1:47:31] why don't you walk with me
[1:47:35] why don't you walk with me
[1:47:37] why don't you take a little stroll with
[1:47:39] me
[1:47:42] he said Lord
[1:47:45] it would be my greatest honor
[1:47:49] who are you walking with
[1:47:52] you're walking
[1:47:54] with King theophany
[1:48:00] I remember right and said here we were
[1:48:01] and I was walking with the Lord
[1:48:03] it's one thing
[1:48:05] for you to ask the Lord to walk with you
[1:48:08] but when he asked this bride will you
[1:48:10] walk with me
[1:48:16] and I'm walking
[1:48:18] and he said it just about my anniversary
[1:48:21] this is where a lot of brothers and
[1:48:22] sisters would kill us today
[1:48:26] he said but it was my anniversary and
[1:48:28] I'd been away from her every year
[1:48:31] 22 years
[1:48:32] I'd be dead
[1:48:36] yeah y'all y'all be looking for a new
[1:48:39] guy it's all like I say
[1:48:41] he said but I'd go up there to a little
[1:48:43] certain spot
[1:48:44] and I'd pay tribute
[1:48:46] to my wife and thank about how she
[1:48:49] stands between me and the public
[1:48:53] how she got gray hair and all of those
[1:48:55] things standing between the people and
[1:48:57] you know the story
[1:48:58] I just want to draw your attention to a
[1:49:00] couple of things right here
[1:49:04] he said there I was
[1:49:06] and that's standing there
[1:49:08] he said but all of a sudden something
[1:49:10] happened
[1:49:12] he said I began to think like a boy
[1:49:15] and every principle I was a boy again
[1:49:18] and I was young
[1:49:20] he said then I looked out before me he
[1:49:23] said there was me to he said I'll rub my
[1:49:25] eyes
[1:49:26] and she was young
[1:49:30] he said then I walked in a little space
[1:49:32] and said yes that's right well he said
[1:49:34] what's going on he said that's right I'm
[1:49:35] walking with you
[1:49:37] I'm walking with you Lord
[1:49:42] and remember what he he began to walk
[1:49:45] and it was he walked to a place and he
[1:49:47] heard and his tears falling on that on
[1:49:49] those dried leaves
[1:49:51] when the Creator does work he does it
[1:49:53] real well
[1:49:58] he said what is it he said it was tears
[1:50:01] dripping off on my face
[1:50:03] he said I looked out and I heard stomp
[1:50:05] stomp stomp and it was three deer out
[1:50:07] there
[1:50:08] he said exactly what we needed he said
[1:50:10] but I made a promise to the Lord that I
[1:50:12] wouldn't kill for other men
[1:50:15] he said I'd had this burden on my life
[1:50:18] for I had this burden on me for all
[1:50:20] those years
[1:50:21] he said I shoot those deer off
[1:50:24] and the Lord spoke to him and said you
[1:50:26] remembered your promise
[1:50:28] and I'll remember mine
[1:50:29] I'll never leave you
[1:50:31] and I'll never forsake you
[1:50:40] you're welcome with Kings theophany
[1:50:46] and it was just a moment for brother
[1:50:48] random
[1:50:53] that he saw himself young again he saw
[1:50:55] his wife young again
[1:50:59] but you're walking and one of these days
[1:51:02] it won't be just for a moment in time
[1:51:05] all of the cells of your body
[1:51:09] who creates hell on top of cell
[1:51:13] and Paul said if this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:51:15] be dissolved we have one waiting
[1:51:17] he said then this will be said that
[1:51:20] mortality is swallowed up
[1:51:22] by life
[1:51:33] bless that
[1:51:50] heaven
[1:51:53] has touched you
[1:51:57] we think about all the things that has
[1:51:59] happened in our own life
[1:52:02] all the goodness of God that's run after
[1:52:05] us
[1:52:06] it's Heaven that has brought you here
[1:52:11] I was I was flipping through
[1:52:13] my Bible when I was scrolling through
[1:52:15] all of the prophecies that Jesus
[1:52:16] fulfilled and a prayer list dropped out
[1:52:18] the prayer list our pastor and had us
[1:52:20] make years ago
[1:52:24] and God has checked off almost every
[1:52:26] single one of them and there were things
[1:52:28] that even happened last weekend
[1:52:30] that the Lord checked off of our list
[1:52:35] sometimes you're gonna you're gonna walk
[1:52:38] through life
[1:52:40] you're going to walk through life and
[1:52:41] you're going to be praying about
[1:52:42] something that you prayed about for a
[1:52:44] very long time
[1:52:46] and it's just going to happen
[1:52:49] and you're going to go down the road
[1:52:51] maybe maybe a couple weeks maybe a
[1:52:52] couple months I think
[1:52:57] well I didn't I didn't realize it
[1:53:00] happened
[1:53:01] I didn't even take to I didn't even
[1:53:03] recognize that you did it hard
[1:53:06] and some of the times he's going to do
[1:53:08] it in such a way
[1:53:10] he's going to do it in such a way
[1:53:12] [Music]
[1:53:14] he's going to do it in such a way
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:19] when everybody sees it and then he's
[1:53:22] going to do it in a way
[1:53:24] and you think Lord I wish you'd have got
[1:53:27] my attention when you when you've done
[1:53:28] it so I could praise you and you're
[1:53:30] gonna think the thing I prayed for
[1:53:33] foreign

[1:53:39] going to call the things that you prayed
[1:53:41] for into the natural and you'll watch it

[1:54:04] ate out of his hands
[1:54:06] what was it it was the creator in action
[1:54:09] again
[1:54:11] you're going to be sitting here and one
[1:54:13] of the things that you prayed for maybe
