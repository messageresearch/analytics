everything that's said and done may it be For Your Glory and for your honor in Jesus name we pray amen and amen amen you love him today amen God's good to us isn't he sure enjoyed the worship this morning and all the specials and and my that that song of the choir I've never heard it sing quite like that but I think it probably just became my favorite version and and uh know sometimes we can drag things but that that was good amen amen you have your Bibles today turn with me to exter chapter 6 thankful for all the wonderful reports we heard last night and and worship of the Saints and the young people getting a supernatural outpouring and uh it's what it's all about we come together we invite him to come there's no man can make it happen as I said you didn't have to prime it up push it up he bubbled it up amen that's exactly what happened love it when it happens that way amen Esther chapter 6 and verse one on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the the book of records of the chonicles and they were read before the king and it was found written that Mori had told of big thanna and of terish two of the king's chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king may the Lord at his Blessing you may be seated this morning I'd like to speak on this morning if the Lord would just help us for a little while on the remembrance the book of remembrance changed your position and hang on a second I got to get out of this fight so I get nervous and then I get sweating and then uh someone says well this sweating part of sweating has nothing to do with my anointing when the anointing comes I sweat when I look at a tool belt so they don't have nothing to do with that we find here in the scripture that the king couldn't sleep and he he could have chose 20 different diversions to fill his sleepless night with but instead he commanded that the Book of Records be brought to him and to be read and the one commanded to bring the book could brought any book of the records of the chonicles but he bought a particular book and the book could have been open to any page but he opened it to the exact page telling the story of Moriah and how he had saved the king from assassination God guided every step along that Journey it wasn't the king's Chamberlain doing the choos it was God right you know Jewish tradition says that when they opened the book at this place he turned over the leaves and would have read another part of the book but a wind came by and blew the leaves of the PIP of the paper of the of the book back open to the same place to where he had opened it at so he was forced to read the paragraph how mori's good service was record orted in Aster 2 and verse 23 where it was found upon record of how he exposed the plot brother that's just a tradition well I know of another time of it happening when a prophet of God didn't understand Hebrews chapter 6 and he was there and he laid open his Bible and a wind came by and blew it open to another passage and he closed the Bible and he laid it down he meditated and then he opened the Bible back up just anywhere but it blew back open to Hebrews chapter 6 and then he saw the vision and then he understood the scripture even as the king had the book of records of chonicles which really literally means a book of remembrance so God also has a book of remembrance and then those who fear the lord Lord spoke to one another and the Lord listened and heard them Malachi chapter 3 so a book of remembrance was written before him for those who fear the lord who meditate on his name what an honor what an honor it is to be in the book of remembrance and the King said what honor or dignity has been bestowed upon Moriah for the deed that he has done and hmon coming to the courts of the king and now who was of the agites who was a descendant of the amalekites who was supposed to be destroyed to begin with by Saul and if Saul would have destroyed him he wouldn't have been a nuisance right so the king said who's in the court and they said hey man just entered the outer court and he's got a suggestion in his heart now he wanted to hang Moriah but the king's wanting to bless Moriah Hallelujah he had a Gallows prepared for him and the King's servant said hmon is here standing in the court and the King said oh let him come in it was no coincidence that hmon entered the king's court at this moment to ask for execution but it was no coincidence that the king wanted to honor Moriah at this moment see when your enemy comes to the king and he wants to come against you the king already has a blessing pronounced upon you and in This Book of Esther shows us anything it shows us that God manages the Affairs of men even without our knowledge God knows what he's doing and in the courts of Heaven there's no coincidences there's no surprises hey well Esther was lucky to be Queen no she wasn't Mori wasn't lucky to be overheard the assassination plot it wasn't luck or chance that made hymon enter the Royal Courts at the time with this on his heart all these events were orchestrated by almighty God not by luck and this becomes difficult when bad things happen to us it's easy to see God's management of all things when we see good things happen but what about the bad right even then we got to trust in God's total total plan realizing all things work together for the good Romans 8: 28 we understand Paul was saying all things work together for the good now you take one event and it might not look so good but the whole plan you got to see the whole picture of God's plan and then it'll all work together for the good so then hmon comes in and he ask the king and the King asked him he says heymen what shall be done to the man whom the king Delights to honor well it's got to be me I'm his right-and man what would I like the king to do for me wow man so he immediately started thinking of Natural Things cuz he was carnal right King goes man ain't nobody else the king wants to Delight more than me isn't it amazing how God already orchestrated so not only all the Jews would be ultimately protected but both Moriah and hmon would get what was deserving to them huh God often the time lets a fallen man set his own trap allowing hmon to make pride and arrogance be the cause of his ultimate demise and humiliation now hmon gives his answer in verse 7-9 of chapter 6 he answers the king and he says for the man whom the king Delights to honor let a royal robe be brought which the King has worn and a horse on which the King has rid and let a crown a Royal Crest be placed on his head then let his robe and the horse be delivered to him by the hand of one of the king's most noble princes that he may be a raid and the man from whom the king Delight to honor and then parade him on horse back through the streets oh yeah man he's setting up a huge celebration for his enemy yet he don't know it but God knew it hmon you know was the only thing that pleased hmon was Applause and and to be shattered to be you know glittering and shining and the center of attention and it's tragic when a man can only believe he has done well when he heard Applause now don't get me wrong there's a good time an appropriate time for applauses to have here on Earth but when you live to expect it and you're seeking for it that's another thing we should seek what wants to be sat to be satisfied with what heaven wants of us and not what man wants of us then the king answered heon he goes that's a good idea heon he says go make ready and take all this stuff and give it to Moriah who sits at the king's gate what Moriah is going to get what I asked for what kind of a joke is this let me tell you the devil wants to do you in but God has another plan wouldn't have been something to seen Hon's face at that time see the king took his vice completely you know you know and you're sitting there and he gives honor to his arch enemy and haymon's coming to ask for the man's execution and what a humiliation but where it changed for Moriah was when the book of remembrance was brought and it was opened it changed his position cuz the king did not know about this plot or about this s thing at the time or had forgotten but when the book became open then it become a brand new identity mori's identity became real it wasn't no longer just a haymon's identity oh yeah he was identified but they changed positions Hallelujah hmon wanted to keep the book sealed you understand the devil wanted to keep the book sealed and as long as it was sealed you would never find your identity isn't that right you you'd have never known who you was but when the book became open it revealed your identity the devil wanted you to sit there and be doomed God says not the time for it for Daniel said seal up the book and reveal it at the time of the end cuz there's a Time coming when the book had to be open but as long as it was sealed as long as it was sealed you didn't have your identity brother would you get me that blue song book off the right there I forgot to bring that out here I'm not going to sing no it's not happening not today anyhow how wanted to be kept sealed so you couldn't find your identity but the time of the end is now here right so now it has to be open and John in Revelations chapter 5 he said who is worthy to take the book and to loose the seals thereof and he looked over heaven and he looked under the Earth and he looked beneath the Earth and he looked in the Earth and nobody was worthy John wasn't worthy brother brandham wasn't worthy brother Ron wasn't worthy huh I wasn't worthy you wasn't worthy nobody was worthy and John began to weep and now just think of it now the lamb begins to come to forth to take the book because it's his book but as long as it's closed you can't see what's in it because the word said for it to be sealed and to be hidden but there's coming a time when it's to be open and John's listen brother B said if John knew that book didn't become open all Humanity was doomed they were lost but the come a time and John's there and he's weeping and all of a sudden he hears a voice saying to him weep not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he is worthy to take the book and to open the seals and John said I turned to look to see a lamb but I didn't see a lamb I saw a Lon that had prevailed he'd been in battle who was he in battle for those whose names were sealed in the book your identity was in here he went to war for you Hallelujah he was making intercession for you and he he said he has prevailed and he said and when I look there he was a bloody bleeding lamb he heard a line I'm sorry I got that wrong well he heard a line but when he looked he saw a lamb that had been slain one that was dead but alive again Hallelujah and when that book became open there was a lot of things in there hidden your identity your name your destiny listen church as long as it was sealed you would never overcome and lay to AIA but when the book became open now you have victory now you have [Applause] freedom Hallelujah everybody wasn't going to be in there everybody's names ain't in the book of redemption but there is a few things that was in there and when John comes here now he's been in now he sees him he's interceding for the souls that would come until the last Soul comes in and we got to be getting close that last soul may be here this morning might just not have given in yet but let me tell you wherever they are let's do our part to find them let's get out of this pest house but when the book became open now it changed John position watch from weeping to shouting Hallelujah now he didn't have nothing to weep about because the lamb had the book Hallelujah in his hands and he was the author of the book Hallelujah so now he's got it in his hands and John said everything in heaven everything beneath the Earth everything in the earth heard me praising God well brother Jason y'all get a little too noisy up there in the mountains of Virginia oh you think it's noisy here wait till you get over there this is the quietest place you'll ever be at you go to hell there's weeping and wailing you go to Glory there'll be shouting on their Hills of Glory so if we're going to shout over there we might as well get ready here your identity has been released the book of remembrance changed our position and when John saw his position it exposed Satan for who he was and what his plan was and his plan was to destroy you and to murder you and to kill you and to send you to a devil's hell but God's plan was is that you might have life and you might have life more abundantly he changed the position from a dying sinner to an everlasting living Saint calling those things which were not as though they were cuz God said so and that's when it changed for for us is when the book came open cuz see before before your book came open this was your book this was your life besides this book ain't got enough pages in it it ain't got enough pages in it for my life but you get the point this was our life full of sin full of misery that's right right and the devil could come to you anytime and say you did this this this and this y'all know what devil y'all know what devil y'all know what devil but once you recognized who you was once your identity had been revealed once you had accepted the message of the hour and recognized it to be Eagle food and once you heard from your theophany and this become an open book listen the Seven Seals being open is not open to everybody it's open to those who can receive it and I happen to believe I'm speaking to a group of people who can receive [Applause] it so what's my book looking like now brother Jason Huh there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus there's no more sin held against you it's all washed away from you what the devil meant for evil God used it for good he changed the position on the devil and put the curse back upon the man whom it came from it's not against us anymore maybe we could word it like this and Jesus said like pil I find no fault in them brother Jason I still remember what I used to do he don't see we're we're we're F out we're going to remember those things and we're we're never going to forget the bad things that we've done but God don't have a record of it your old record has been diversed it's been put away that's why you can sing the way you sing that's why you can worship the way you worship the old man is dead there's a brand new man you've been set free and he who the son has made free is free [Applause] indeed and it's only to be revealed at the last day he said verse Seal when this actual seal is broken broken to whom not to Christ but to the church notice oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands what I mean you people and then he stops and he goes I'm going to call you bride so that you might understand you're not part of the church out there you're the Lamb's wife you're his bride and the open book now changed your position you once was a sinner but now you are a child of God but really you always was a child of God you just now recognize you was a child of God and you can't eat on the dead caring of the world Christians don't eat that way we don't eat on denominational doctrines we eat on the fresh kill of the word and the fresh kill of the word is here it's Among Us he's making himself revealed in this this last hour he's coming behind his word and vindicating he he's proud when his word is preached and now he promised us in this last day a full Square meal a seven course menu for all the seals is open and ready for the word of God to those who can receive I don't know about you but how many can receive it because it's for you so then when you receive the word you find your identity in it when you receive this open book it changes you brother B said when the seals come open it made the Bible a brand new book to him and if it made it a new book to the prophet it ought to make it a new book to the people of you're the people of the book the book was redeemed because of you wasn't redeemed because of your enemy it's redeemed because of you I forgot to set my timer when I started so if I go over Drew grab me can you IM can you

because we are believers and Believers just put it in the hands of God and they march on it don't matter how tough it looks how bad it looks we're not [Applause] quitting we are believers and that's what believers do we simply believe the [Applause] word glor glory to God I played brother r a video the other day and this is I was trying to figure out what to preach this morning and I played in that video and I was like man I used that video somewhere in one of my notes and I typed it in and it was in this message I'm like well I'm just going to take it as a word from the Lord that's what we are to be preaching but I saw a video of a minister who was talking about the thief on the cross and that Thief that was there he wasn't a Believer he didn't attend Jesus's meetings he didn't go to church like we do every Sunday he was a thief right that's all he was just a thief on the cross and one on the one side be to R Jesus and ridicule him and accuse him of false things and and the other one said why why don't you just shut up over there this man's done nothing we deserve to die but he's done nothing right he ain't done anything to deserve what he's getting and the man just simply looked over to Jesus and he said remember me when you come into your kingdom that's all he said and Jesus said this day you shall be with me in Paradise amen and that ended it he was there so when the man arrives and he gets to the gate and the Angel's there to greet him maybe it went something like this he said what are you doing here I don't know I don't know what I'm doing here how did you get in I'm not sure about that either what makes you think you have the right to come in you you never was at the synagogues you knew you was right en you was filthy you was a thief we all saw how you lived you sure wasn't perfect he says I don't understand why you're here let me call my supervisor Angel he said this is what the other preacher was saying we call the supervisor Angel supervisor Angel comes up and he begins to question him why are you here well sir I really don't know he says well let's just go right to the scriptures do you know the do you know the doctrine of justification by faith never heard of it do you know about sanctification never heard of it I'm just going to add a few more in there do you know about the third pool do you understand all that never heard of it did you ever hear about baptism in Jesus name never heard of it well what makes you think you can come in and the thief said sir all I know is the man on the middle tree said I could come he said I could go free he said I could be here he I wasn't baptized I didn't go to none of the meetings I didn't have the opportunity to be baptized but I tell you what if he had have he would have been but there he was hanging and he said I can come because the midal man said I could come Hallelujah and because he said I could come that's why I'm here here and God hadn't forgot about you today he knows exactly what you need all you got to say is Lord remember me huh that's what made the difference in this man's life it actually changed his position don't you love him this morning let's just stand and give him praise today I don't know how long I've preach but the book of remembrance was hanging beside him and because it was beside him he receiv received the book of remembrance and it changed his identity From a Thief to a Believer glory to God somebody ought to give him praise this morning you was the thief you was the one you was in Hon's position but God rich in Mercy reached down his hand picked you up changed your life gave you a new desire set you on fire for God took out the cold Stony heart gave you a new heart that's the kind of God we serve amen do you love him this morning

witness we're a witness that this open book has changed our position we're a witness of it Miracles are not something new to us because God is all Supernatural they're Supernatural to us but it's natural for God to do these things we are a witness that the same angel that was with William brandham the same angel that was with the pillar that was with the children of Israel as a pillar of fire that same Angel's here I want to share this with you this come from Brother Joel just come on my heart he sent me this this week you all know that his father his father has been facing and been diagnosed with cancer but he shared this with me this week he said I just wanted to send you a quick note quick text because I'm about to come unglued with joy I found out the test results from my dad that he went back for following up testing and his numbers have dropped dramatically in his PSA which indicates that where the cancer has originated from the cancer is dying without chemotherapy hallelujah hallelujah why shouldn't we why shouldn't we praise him why wouldn't she why shouldn't we magnify his name I believe I've come unglued we've had a week this week both our dads both our dads we got two witnesses in the message cancer has no hold so if he can do that in the eye and if he can do that all the way in Ohio surely he can take a man of God God that has refused to back down and he can curse cancer throughout all of his body well we might as well come unglued [Applause] hallelujah what a weekend what a blessing what a time in the presence of the Lord many of you weren't here last night many had done been dismissed and I got to see something last night and I saw the full vision of what our pastor anticipated with those doors open back there because the Holy Spirit was still dealing with brothers and sisters here as it was dismissed but the presence of God was so thick that it literally draw people that had already been dismissed right back in and I've never seen anything like I've ever seen before thank you our young people so moved by the holy spirit so touched little five and six and eight and nine year old girls coming out of here speaking and singing in tongues what is it it's exactly what brother Jason preached last night it's a power within he will finish the work no it's not everything no it's not everything to shout no it's not everything to speak in tongues but it sure does mean something when The Giver of the gift comes and pours out his life so much and I believe that some people ought to take a lesson from these young kids that they're so moved by the Holy Ghost what we've seen in this generation he will finish what he's about to do the body change is our goal and sing that song down from his glory so if you have not been a part of our After parties here at Full Gospel Lighthouse we welcome you we welcome you if you don't want to be dismissed you don't have to be dismissed we got a team here that will help you we are experts in the Holy Ghost around hereu we have a car pickup line right out here if you're so drunk on the Holy Ghost we'll make sure that you get in the car and you have a responsible driver but we invite you we invite you to come and be a part of this we the thing that point that so amazes me about the grace of God is that when you watch one person get the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is a sign to me that it's him it's because they come out and what do they want they want the next person to get what they just received and brother brandham said now if we're too ashamed to testify what he did for us he said it really wasn't a holy ghost but to see somebody come out from underneath that anointing and say I want to see that for that one I want to see it for that one for Gospel Lighthouse you're a light to the world that there is still a god down from his glory ever living story my God and savior came and Jesus was his born in the manger to his own a stranger a man of sorrow tears
