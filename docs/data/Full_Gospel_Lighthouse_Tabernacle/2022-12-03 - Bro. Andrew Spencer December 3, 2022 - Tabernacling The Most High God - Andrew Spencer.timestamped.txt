[50:31] we thank you Father for what you're
[50:32] about to do in this place and we'll be
[50:35] careful to serve you in the name of the
[50:37] Lord Jesus Christ
[50:39] amen
[50:40] amen if you have your Bibles this
[50:42] evening we'd like to look over in the
[50:44] Book of Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18 then
[50:48] down to Ephesians
[50:50] Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 18.
[51:17] he knows
[51:23] he said
[51:47] to the Lord
[51:50] is amen
[51:55] he's faithful amen what a protector that
[51:58] we have
[51:59] amen
[52:02] and we thank the Lord for his mercies
[52:04] that endure to all generations Genesis
[52:07] chapter 14 and verse 18 and Melchizedek
[52:11] king of Salem brought forth Bread and
[52:14] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[52:16] high God and he blessed him and said
[52:18] Blessed Be Abram or the most high god
[52:21] possessor of Heaven and Earth
[52:23] and blessed be the most high God which
[52:25] hath delivered thine enemies into thine
[52:27] hand and he gave him tithes of all
[52:31] Ephesians chapter 1
[52:33] and verse 18.
[52:36] the eyes of your understanding being
[52:38] enlightened that you may know what is
[52:41] the hope of his calling and what the
[52:43] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[52:45] in the Saints
[52:46] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[52:49] his power to us word who believe
[52:51] according to the working of his mighty
[52:53] power
[52:54] which he wrought in Christ when he
[52:55] raised him from the dead and set him at
[52:58] his own right hand in the Heavenly
[53:00] places far above all principality and
[53:03] power and might and dominion and every
[53:06] name that is named not only in this
[53:08] world but also in that which is to come
[53:10] and hath put all things under his feet
[53:12] and gave him to be the head over all
[53:15] things to the church which is his body
[53:18] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[53:22] all may God bless his word he may be
[53:24] seated here in the presence of the Lord
[53:26] as you said we'd like to speak to you on
[53:28] tabernacling tabernacling the most high
[53:31] God and we've spent the last couple
[53:32] weekends on on dealing with blessed by
[53:36] the most high God and we recognize that
[53:38] that we have the great strong one that
[53:41] is amongst us the El elean the most high
[53:43] God and we recognize by by just going in
[53:47] review just for a moment that there is
[53:49] no God that is above our God there is no
[53:51] need that is above our God there is no
[53:53] no a weapon that is formed against his
[53:56] children that shall prosper and I think
[53:58] it's amazing that throughout the Bible
[54:00] that God would declare how powerful that
[54:03] he truly is and how wonderful that he is
[54:06] and I believe that God I would say it in
[54:08] my way that God isn't shy on who he is
[54:11] God isn't ashamed about who he is he's
[54:14] not afraid to testify how great he is
[54:16] he's not afraid that it'll be too bold
[54:19] or it'll be to to uh abundant or to to
[54:22] be uh to be to uh I want to use a word
[54:25] but I'm not going to use that word but
[54:27] it would be too it would be too much
[54:29] he's not afraid that he he's not ashamed
[54:32] to tell us how great he is it's it's not
[54:34] it's not that he would be bragging on
[54:36] himself he is The Great I Am you see if
[54:39] you are if you are the greatest you can
[54:42] testify that you are the greatest when
[54:44] Muhammad Ali was at his Elite he could
[54:47] testify that there was nobody that could
[54:49] beat him but as he got older in age
[54:51] there were other Champions that came
[54:52] behind him that had took on the belt and
[54:55] become the world champion of the world
[54:56] but there is nobody that has ever taken
[54:59] the title away from our heavenly father
[55:02] and God is not ashamed to call himself
[55:05] the most high God for even the Bible
[55:08] tells us that Psalms 83 and 18 that men
[55:11] may know that thou that thou whose name
[55:14] alone is Jehovah are most high over all
[55:18] the Earth so God isn't ashamed he isn't
[55:20] ashamed to tell us who he is but I will
[55:23] say this that God is not ashamed to tell
[55:25] who his children is God is not ashamed
[55:28] and he's not shy about his children he's
[55:30] not shy about his protection plan he's
[55:33] not shy about what he thinks about them
[55:35] that he has raised them to set in in a
[55:38] believer's position and God knows who
[55:42] she is and he knows exactly where she's
[55:45] at and there's nothing that can happen
[55:47] to her unless he's already seen it taken
[55:50] place or transpiring before the
[55:52] foundation of the world and I believe
[55:54] that gives us great consolation tonight
[55:56] as the children of the most high God to
[55:59] recognize that there's nothing coming
[56:01] and there's nothing going that God
[56:03] doesn't already know about in our life
[56:05] and to think that tonight that before
[56:07] Abraham got up there on Mount Moriah
[56:10] with Isaac God had already provided for
[56:13] himself a sacrifice and Abraham knew and
[56:16] Isaac was raised in worship and he knew
[56:19] he knew all of those things but before
[56:21] Abraham got up there God already had a
[56:24] plan and I'll say this tonight that when
[56:26] you come into this world God had a plan
[56:29] for you and there's no weapon there's no
[56:31] enemy there's no torment that can stop
[56:34] the very plan of God from getting you to
[56:37] your destination as a child of God I
[56:39] think it's amazing that that when
[56:41] Abraham was up there when he was up
[56:43] there on the mountain and God declared
[56:45] himself as Jehovah Jireh the Lord will
[56:48] provide for himself a sacrifice that God
[56:50] made this Covenant with Abraham in
[56:52] Genesis 22 and 17 that in blessing I
[56:56] Will Bless thee and in multiplying will
[56:58] I multiply thy seed as the stars of
[57:00] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[57:03] seashore and thy seed let's say that
[57:05] together and thy seed shall possess the
[57:08] Gate of his enemies and in thy seed
[57:10] shall all the nations of the earth be
[57:13] blessed because thou has obeyed my voice
[57:16] and to think that our great father
[57:18] Abraham the patriarch because he obeyed
[57:21] the very voice of God that there is a
[57:24] blessing upon the children of Abraham
[57:26] tonight to think that that your father
[57:28] because because your father Abraham
[57:31] decided to choose to follow God even
[57:34] though it was hard and even though it it
[57:36] may have hurt his flesh may have hurt
[57:37] his heart to go up there on Mount Moriah
[57:40] and take his only son a prayer but
[57:42] because Abraham obeyed the voice of God
[57:45] God told to him and blessing our
[57:48] blessing you see if you touch one of
[57:50] God's children there is an automatic
[57:52] curse that comes back upon the enemy
[57:55] that has touched you because the Bible
[57:57] says touch not mine on it and do my
[58:00] prophets no harm and we recognize that
[58:02] there is another prophet in the day and
[58:05] it's the Holy Spirit and it's living in
[58:07] a people that's so tabernacled by the
[58:10] most high God that Satan has always
[58:12] wondered where will she be at when will
[58:15] she come and finally Satan has an enemy
[58:18] Satan has an enemy as the blood of Jesus
[58:21] Christ that is fully adorned in the
[58:24] adoption wedding band has a wedding band
[58:27] on her hand robed in his righteousness
[58:29] and I'll say this that this bride has
[58:32] everything to defeat anything that Satan
[58:35] throws at her
[58:38] [Applause]
[58:40] hey amen
[58:41] if we're gonna be an enemy to somebody I
[58:44] want to be an enemy to Satan himself
[58:47] I'll tell you if Lucifer is going to
[58:49] fight somebody I'll say let's give him a
[58:51] good fight
[58:52] I think if we could just have a
[58:54] conversation with old Lou tonight we'll
[58:56] just tell old Lou you don't have enough
[58:58] to stop the children of God you see
[59:01] because the one that is on my side oh
[59:03] Lou is more than you could ever be the
[59:06] one that Tabernacles my body has got so
[59:09] much power that he can knock cancer out
[59:11] of my body he can knock sickness out of
[59:14] my body oh Lou I want you to listen up
[59:16] you can try withhold your might but the
[59:19] most high God is tabernacled in the body
[59:23] all right
[59:25] brother man upset here in the late
[59:27] Odyssey in church age he said he said
[59:29] these things saith the faith one true
[59:31] witness now I want to show you what I
[59:33] find what I find in the thought of
[59:35] faithful he said you know we often talk
[59:37] about the great unchanging God whose
[59:39] word does not change and when we speak
[59:41] of him after the manner we often get a
[59:43] view of him that makes him seem very
[59:47] impersonable he said it is as though God
[59:50] made the whole universe and all the laws
[59:52] that pertain to it and then stood back
[59:54] and became a great impersonal God he
[59:57] said it is though that that God made a
[1:00:00] way of salvation for his lost mankind
[1:00:02] that they that way being the cross and
[1:00:05] then when the South when salvation or
[1:00:07] then when the death of Christ had a tone
[1:00:09] for our sins and his resurrection gave
[1:00:11] us an open door to him God just folded
[1:00:14] up his arms and stood back he said it is
[1:00:17] as if we majored in believing in a great
[1:00:20] Creator who having created lost personal
[1:00:22] interest in his creation isn't that
[1:00:25] amazing that some people get that idea
[1:00:27] but notice what your Prophet said he
[1:00:29] said but now I want to say to you he
[1:00:31] said that's how too many people are apt
[1:00:33] to think but that is wrong thinking for
[1:00:36] God is governing in the Affairs of men
[1:00:39] right now he is governing in the Affairs
[1:00:42] of men right now he is both Creator and
[1:00:45] sustainer for the Bible said in
[1:00:47] Colossians 1 and 16 for by him were all
[1:00:50] things created that are in heaven and
[1:00:52] that are in Earth visible and invisible
[1:00:53] whether they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:00:55] principalities or Powers all things were
[1:00:58] created by Him and for him he is before
[1:01:01] all things and by him all things consist
[1:01:05] he is a sovereign God by his own counsel
[1:01:09] he purposed The Plan of Salvation of his
[1:01:12] own elect which he for new so let me say
[1:01:15] it again that God is governing in the
[1:01:17] Affairs of men right now he is both
[1:01:20] Creator and he is both sustainer so to
[1:01:23] think that tonight if you've got Bruce
[1:01:25] Hills in your body that God can create
[1:01:27] eight new cells in your body if you've
[1:01:30] got an enemy that is that is robbing you
[1:01:31] or depleting you of your strength he is
[1:01:34] a sustainer of your soul now I was
[1:01:37] reading a little uh devotion with my
[1:01:38] daughters last night and it was talking
[1:01:40] about the creation of humanity when God
[1:01:43] created Adam and when God created Eve
[1:01:45] he's the the devotion said that there
[1:01:48] were God's fingerprints all over Adam
[1:01:51] because he was the one that made them
[1:01:53] and to think that tonight that all over
[1:01:56] your life there is in your destiny the
[1:01:58] Fingerprints of almighty God there is
[1:02:01] nothing that happened to you the car
[1:02:03] wreck had God's mind in it the problems
[1:02:06] and the and the money when it run out of
[1:02:08] your bank account had God's fingerprints
[1:02:10] upon it when you got sick and he thought
[1:02:13] you wasn't going to make it God had his
[1:02:15] fingerprints upon it if you were his but
[1:02:18] for the foundation of the world there is
[1:02:20] nothing
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:23] there ain't nothing that can rob you
[1:02:26] from almighty God I'll just say what job
[1:02:29] said that job said that he is one mind
[1:02:31] and who can turn him so if God has one
[1:02:34] mind who can turn him the devil sure
[1:02:37] can't turn him the enemies of God sir
[1:02:39] can't turn him I'll say this they're
[1:02:42] those and there's no devil that can
[1:02:44] change the very mind of God
[1:02:47] I think it's amazing when you begin to
[1:02:49] think that God's got one mind he's got
[1:02:51] one course and he's got one goal and if
[1:02:54] he's looking upon a people that's
[1:02:56] destined for a Rapture I'll say God
[1:02:58] knows how to get us there
[1:03:00] now notice that the Bible tells us in
[1:03:03] Acts chapter 7 and verse 48 that how be
[1:03:06] at the most high dwelleth not in temples
[1:03:08] made with hands as saith the prophet
[1:03:10] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my
[1:03:13] footstool what house will you build me
[1:03:15] save the Lord or what is the place of my
[1:03:18] rest and you find that when Jesus came
[1:03:21] he said sacrifice and offerings thou
[1:03:23] what is not but a body thou Hast prepare
[1:03:26] for me you see when God was here on
[1:03:29] Earth The Great I Am the most high God
[1:03:32] was now tabernacled in the body of Jesus
[1:03:36] Christ
[1:03:37] to think that the same one that Abraham
[1:03:40] was having conversations conversations
[1:03:42] with back there on the backside of that
[1:03:44] desert was now living in the body of
[1:03:47] Jesus Christ brother Brandon said he
[1:03:50] said he wanted to use his gift he said
[1:03:52] that was in a man God wanted to use his
[1:03:54] gift that was in a man he said the
[1:03:56] Corporal body called Jesus which was his
[1:03:58] Dwelling Place he said the bodies of
[1:04:00] Tabernacle and God was tabernacling here
[1:04:03] on Earth he said do you believe that
[1:04:05] brethren in the body of Jesus Christ he
[1:04:08] said God wanted to use his gift so he
[1:04:11] showed his son to leave the home of
[1:04:13] Lazarus and Martha and then to go away
[1:04:16] for several days because Lazarus was
[1:04:18] going to die now God wasn't becoming
[1:04:20] impersonable to Lazarus but God knew
[1:04:23] what he was doing
[1:04:24] because God had already thought about
[1:04:27] Abraham or God had already thought about
[1:04:29] Lazarus before Lazarus got in this
[1:04:32] situation
[1:04:34] now can you go into your next trouble
[1:04:36] knowing that the most high God has
[1:04:39] already seen your way of Escape out of
[1:04:40] this saint if it comes by the way of
[1:04:43] death God's already got a way of Escape
[1:04:45] out of you
[1:04:47] and you begin to think in your mind you
[1:04:49] just you just begin to think well all of
[1:04:51] the calamities that are happening to the
[1:04:53] children of God we've got this one
[1:04:54] dealing with this one we've got this one
[1:04:56] deal with this sickness or this one's
[1:04:57] dealing with cancer that one's dealing
[1:04:59] with cancer this one's got a RSV and
[1:05:01] pneumonia and covet and all these things
[1:05:03] and you begin to think in your mind
[1:05:05] Satan would like to drop things in your
[1:05:07] mind and say well really who's in charge
[1:05:09] here
[1:05:11] who's in charge here when Satan's rage
[1:05:13] and who's in charge does it look like
[1:05:15] when cancer is whipping you that God's
[1:05:18] in charge does it look like when we pray
[1:05:20] for this one or we pray for that one and
[1:05:23] they end up dying and go by the way of
[1:05:25] grave
[1:05:27] who's really in charge here that's what
[1:05:29] the enemy would like to put in your mind
[1:05:31] or you laid hands on this one and they
[1:05:33] passed away you prayed the prayer of
[1:05:35] faith over this one and they still
[1:05:37] remain sick and you curse the very life
[1:05:39] of Satan in this one and he's still
[1:05:42] fighting on the inside of them
[1:05:44] I think it's amazing the voice that
[1:05:46] Satan likes to put into the most
[1:05:48] powerful people on the face of the Earth
[1:05:50] he likes to whisper in our ears
[1:05:53] and tell us that God's lost control well
[1:05:56] I'll say this either God's reigning or
[1:05:58] is being reigned over either God is the
[1:06:00] greatest god and knows all things or
[1:06:03] he's the biggest hypocrite and he's the
[1:06:05] biggest liar that there ever has been
[1:06:08] but the Bible says that he is the
[1:06:10] governor of all Nations he's ruling in
[1:06:14] the Hearts and Thoughts of all men right
[1:06:16] now
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:18] and I put my voice with Balaam for the
[1:06:21] false prophet with his prophecy that
[1:06:23] went out there and said God is not a man
[1:06:25] that he should lie neither is the son of
[1:06:27] man neither is the son of man that he
[1:06:29] should repent
[1:06:31] let me say this God is the greatest god
[1:06:34] that there ever has been and when Balaam
[1:06:37] received the blessing from almighty God
[1:06:40] he said I have received a blessing from
[1:06:43] the Lord to bless them and I can't
[1:06:46] reverse it
[1:06:47] I'll say this that Jesus Christ has
[1:06:50] already put a blessing on your life by
[1:06:52] giving you the Holy Ghost and he's not
[1:06:54] in the mind of returning the blessing
[1:06:59] I say God's already got a little girl
[1:07:01] already picked out for you sister Hannah
[1:07:03] and he ain't planning on returning that
[1:07:05] I say God's got a perfect body for
[1:07:07] everyone sitting here and he ain't
[1:07:09] planning on sending it back and saying
[1:07:11] well that one's disabled that one ain't
[1:07:14] gonna make it God's already got you your
[1:07:17] healing already picked out God's already
[1:07:19] got your outpouring Big Town
[1:07:22] [Applause]
[1:07:24] God is not in the discontinuing business
[1:07:26] this Christmas there'll be a lot of
[1:07:29] returns but God ain't returning what
[1:07:31] he's gave out he's pouring it out more
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:45] foreign
[1:07:48] you see God was so Tabernacle in Jesus
[1:07:52] Christ
[1:07:55] that he was over there he'd walked away
[1:07:57] from his best friend in life
[1:08:01] walked away from him
[1:08:03] because he knew the works of God
[1:08:05] can you imagine
[1:08:07] how powerful a moment that Jesus was
[1:08:10] having
[1:08:11] knowing the will of the father
[1:08:14] I've got to walk away from him to do the
[1:08:17] works of almighty God
[1:08:19] but you notice when they question Jesus
[1:08:22] about his doings and his Works he said
[1:08:25] oh no this sickness is not unto death
[1:08:28] you see Jesus knew what the father had
[1:08:31] in planned because a vision was shown
[1:08:34] him what was going to transpire in
[1:08:37] lazarus's life and Martha when she saw
[1:08:40] Jesus coming she said Master if you
[1:08:43] would have been here my brother would
[1:08:45] not have died she said but even now Lord
[1:08:48] I know that you have the words of
[1:08:51] Almighty life of eternal life he said
[1:08:54] that whatever you asked she said
[1:08:55] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:08:58] you he said my brother will live again
[1:09:01] she said well I know that he's going to
[1:09:03] live again in the in the resurrection he
[1:09:05] said but I am the resurrection and the
[1:09:07] life you see everything that Martha and
[1:09:10] Mary had been weeping about was
[1:09:12] fulfilled in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:09:15] and I'll say this that everything that
[1:09:17] you have need of is in the body of of
[1:09:19] Jesus Christ healing is in the body
[1:09:22] Deliverance is in the body A sound mind
[1:09:24] is in the body
[1:09:27] is that right a cell mind is in the body
[1:09:29] and Martha never wavered in her face she
[1:09:33] always believed that Jesus was the
[1:09:35] resurrection
[1:09:39] when everybody's at his grave and
[1:09:40] they're questioning
[1:09:41] who is this guy he said he was his
[1:09:44] friend he says he's a resurrection
[1:09:46] surely if he was the resurrection he
[1:09:49] would have rolled the stone away but our
[1:09:51] Prophet said that Martha and Mary had
[1:09:53] something to do too they had to put
[1:09:55] their hands upon the stone and they had
[1:09:57] to roll the stone away and I'll say this
[1:10:00] you've got some faith that got to go
[1:10:02] into operation you've got some strength
[1:10:04] muscles that's got to go into operation
[1:10:06] You've Got to Believe In the most high
[1:10:08] God you've got to go to the lowest and
[1:10:11] still believe he's living on the inside
[1:10:12] of you you've got to go through sickness
[1:10:15] and believe he's more than evil why
[1:10:17] don't you put your hand upon the stone
[1:10:19] that is in your way that's a give way to
[1:10:23] Victory
[1:10:25] what was Martha doing she was open the
[1:10:29] door for her brother to come back
[1:10:32] you don't know what you're doing right
[1:10:33] now but by your faith and by your pool
[1:10:36] you are opening a door for particles to
[1:10:39] come back you are opening a door for
[1:10:41] healing to enter this room by your faith
[1:10:44] you are opening a door for the
[1:10:46] miraculous
[1:10:48] Hallelujah you don't know what you're
[1:10:51] doing but the son of man is in the
[1:10:53] building
[1:10:54] thank you
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:10:57] he's here to feel you he's here to heal
[1:11:00] you he's here to save you he's here to
[1:11:03] deliver you when the son of man steps in
[1:11:05] the room get away take the grave close
[1:11:08] off of him
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:15] you don't know what you're doing
[1:11:20] and Satan's screaming
[1:11:24] do you realize how dead he is
[1:11:28] do you realize how bad he stinks
[1:11:34] do you understand what Satan is trying
[1:11:36] to put in their minds
[1:11:38] he's putting in their mind carnal things
[1:11:40] and carnal blockages and Cardinal
[1:11:43] roadblocks but I want you to know that
[1:11:45] Jesus said just get ready
[1:11:48] just get ready he prayed the prayer he
[1:11:51] said father I prayed this not because of
[1:11:54] myself but because of them that are
[1:11:56] sitting around here and God could have
[1:11:58] done it Jesus could have done it and he
[1:12:01] spoke to the stone and it would have
[1:12:03] been an obliterated right there but God
[1:12:05] knew that there was some works that had
[1:12:08] to be manifested Jesus said the works
[1:12:11] that I do shall you do also
[1:12:14] notice Martha never wavered Mary was
[1:12:17] consistent in her faith to say that
[1:12:19] Jesus's feet and brother Branham said in
[1:12:22] the spoken word is the Original Seed he
[1:12:24] said by your constant belief in the word
[1:12:26] and the life that you now live never
[1:12:29] deny nothing he said it makes the word
[1:12:31] become flesh by the life that you live
[1:12:34] never denying the message never to die
[1:12:37] in healing it makes the word be becomes
[1:12:40] flesh
[1:12:42] now God ain't never left himself without
[1:12:44] a witness God will always have a witness
[1:12:48] now God raised up 120 Witnesses on the
[1:12:51] day of Pentecost because God needed a
[1:12:53] witness and I'll say God has need of
[1:12:56] witnesses again in this day he's got to
[1:12:59] have somebody that he can put their hand
[1:13:01] upon them and he knows that they're
[1:13:03] never going to leave him they're never
[1:13:04] going to forsake his call that they will
[1:13:07] be a witness to him in good times and in
[1:13:10] bad times
[1:13:11] you see his word tonight is as effective
[1:13:14] in your heart as a Believer as it ever
[1:13:17] was when he said it in the beginning
[1:13:19] when he said it when Jesus was here it's
[1:13:21] just as effective in your heart tonight
[1:13:24] as a believer
[1:13:27] now the Bible said lay hands on the sick
[1:13:29] and they shall recover is that right
[1:13:31] we are a body Believers and we believe
[1:13:35] that the apostolic faith has been
[1:13:38] returned back to the children of the
[1:13:40] most high God and we recognize that when
[1:13:43] my papa Charlie Spencer many years ago
[1:13:46] was working in a chimney pan and then he
[1:13:49] got his fingers ripped off by using by
[1:13:51] using a a piece of equipment and the
[1:13:54] RPMs wrapped around this glove and
[1:13:56] ripped his fingers off the doctors told
[1:13:58] my dad said now look all we can do is
[1:14:01] put Nubs back on there we can just sew
[1:14:04] it up there the fingers are too far gone
[1:14:05] he said no he said he said we can't he
[1:14:08] said he'll lose his finger he'll lose
[1:14:10] everything that there is my dad said now
[1:14:12] look if you don't put those fingers back
[1:14:15] on there when Charlie Spencer wakes up
[1:14:17] he's going to be a Madman he said but we
[1:14:21] are believers and you sow them back on
[1:14:23] there and we'll believe God that he'll
[1:14:26] put them back into operation again
[1:14:29] foreign
[1:14:29] I'll say when you take God at his word
[1:14:32] God will do the impossible in your life
[1:14:35] if you can take him for your healing
[1:14:37] right now you can be healed at the
[1:14:39] matter of the sound of my voice you can
[1:14:41] receive your healing if you're Desiring
[1:14:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the son of
[1:14:46] man is in the room
[1:14:48] and there's a cry for an outpouring of
[1:14:50] the Holy Ghost and I'll say this if you
[1:14:53] can believe God will give it out if
[1:14:56] there's everything anything that we need
[1:14:58] in this hour it's another outpouring
[1:15:00] [Applause]
[1:15:03] I ain't talking about some science I'm
[1:15:05] talking about some intellectual idea
[1:15:07] where we get so high we get so built up
[1:15:10] you think science and intellect was
[1:15:12] going to help Abraham and help Sarah get
[1:15:14] a baby they needed a body change they
[1:15:16] needed an experience with Melchizedek
[1:15:18] and I'll tell you our young people don't
[1:15:20] need no signs they don't need no
[1:15:22] intellectualism what they need is an
[1:15:25] old-fashioned Holy Ghost Field baptism
[1:15:28] experience by the anointing of almighty
[1:15:30] God I tell you what we need we need an
[1:15:33] old-fashioned Revival where we shake
[1:15:35] this to lactites out of hell and knock
[1:15:38] them right in the devil's eye and we
[1:15:40] shake it down Shake kingdoms down Shake
[1:15:43] hell down that's what we need another
[1:15:45] outpouring
[1:15:51] brother Burnham's head that until God
[1:15:54] stops calling the Pentecostal power and
[1:15:57] the Pentecostal message will never cease
[1:15:59] and if a prophet's headed I believe it
[1:16:02] and the powers here the experiences here
[1:16:05] the Holy Ghost is here
[1:16:07] [Applause]
[1:16:20] when John and all the disciples are on
[1:16:23] the boat
[1:16:24] and Jesus was back here sleeping
[1:16:26] brother Bynum goes back in there and the
[1:16:28] testimony to see and he Taps into their
[1:16:31] conversation
[1:16:33] he said I can see John saying this he
[1:16:35] said my daddy told that he was coming
[1:16:38] this way they told me what Moses did
[1:16:40] they told me what Elijah did they told
[1:16:43] me what Jehovah did in Abraham
[1:16:45] and brother Adam said that when they
[1:16:48] watch him
[1:16:49] they were watching he said John said he
[1:16:52] has the habits of Jehovah now they don't
[1:16:56] watch they don't watch throughout the
[1:16:58] Old Testament what Jehovah did and all
[1:17:00] of his angels the prophets back there
[1:17:02] they watched what he did in those
[1:17:04] Messengers as they come up in every
[1:17:06] generation those prophets that would
[1:17:07] rise up and they watched the habits of
[1:17:10] Jehovah in those prophets and now
[1:17:12] they're watching those same habits in
[1:17:15] Jesus Christ said he's got the habits of
[1:17:18] Jehovah and when Jesus was out there and
[1:17:21] he asked he said do you have any meat
[1:17:23] when there was a crowd that was
[1:17:24] following him and he began to he began
[1:17:26] to wonder about the five thousand now
[1:17:28] look we can't send them away like this
[1:17:30] he said they came here they come out
[1:17:33] here for the message we've got to feed
[1:17:35] them and Brother Bruno said that God had
[1:17:38] something to show in the resurrection
[1:17:40] when Jesus took those uncooked fish and
[1:17:43] he took that bread and he began to
[1:17:45] multiply it and it wasn't uncooked but
[1:17:48] it was cooked now you people like fried
[1:17:50] fish I say Jesus was right on your side
[1:17:53] that day need a little bit of bread you
[1:17:55] ain't got to worry about Long John
[1:17:57] Silvers with Jesus he makes the best
[1:17:59] fish you ain't got to worry about the
[1:18:01] extra Crispies he makes the best fish
[1:18:03] when the resurrection when I am the
[1:18:06] resurrection and the life takes a hold
[1:18:08] of your meal basket prepare to be
[1:18:10] blessed
[1:18:11] [Applause]
[1:18:13] it was showing that he had a part in the
[1:18:17] resurrection
[1:18:19] and you know God will always bless
[1:18:21] people that walk in his way that's
[1:18:23] provided unto them he blessed Noah
[1:18:26] because he gave him a way that was
[1:18:27] provided for him
[1:18:29] he blessed Abraham because he walked
[1:18:32] into a way that was provided for Him He
[1:18:34] blesses those that walk in a way that's
[1:18:37] already provided for him
[1:18:39] now you're very aware that there's a
[1:18:41] presence in this room
[1:18:46] you know and I know that it's milky all
[1:18:48] over this place and the presence of the
[1:18:51] Living God is here so I invite you to
[1:18:53] pull that presence right into your life
[1:18:55] to overcome your troubles overcome your
[1:18:58] situations now he said not thy seed
[1:19:01] shall possess the Gate of his enemies he
[1:19:04] said now what are we afraid about he
[1:19:05] said possess the gates he said we have
[1:19:08] God's promise he said we have his word
[1:19:11] we have his holy spirit the angels of
[1:19:13] God are encamped about he said
[1:19:15] everything's in order every wall can be
[1:19:17] took down he said it's already took down
[1:19:20] the Son of God goes before us his
[1:19:22] Banners are waving and there's nothing
[1:19:24] can stand in the weight of the saint
[1:19:26] going to meet a promise of God he said
[1:19:28] death can't stop it the Grave can't stop
[1:19:31] it the devil can't stop it we are more
[1:19:33] than conquerors sickness is conquered
[1:19:36] for you death is conquered for you
[1:19:40] and you are tabernacling the most high
[1:19:44] God
[1:19:50] for the Bible said in Isaiah 9 and 6
[1:19:53] that For unto us let's say that together
[1:19:56] for unto us a child is born unto us a
[1:20:00] son is given and the government shall be
[1:20:03] upon his shoulders and his name shall be
[1:20:05] called the wonderful counselor the
[1:20:07] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[1:20:10] prince of peace and the government shall
[1:20:13] be upon his shoulders now what is what
[1:20:16] is that it's a part what is his shoulder
[1:20:19] it's a part of his body
[1:20:22] you see that's his body it's his
[1:20:24] shoulder it's his body he said where is
[1:20:26] the government on Earth in his body
[1:20:29] to think that you have jurisdiction in
[1:20:33] this world
[1:20:35] you have the government on your
[1:20:38] shoulders the very Judgment of God the
[1:20:41] very word of God upon your shoulders
[1:20:44] notice what William Branham said he said
[1:20:46] that's where the real Church speaks in
[1:20:48] his power there's where Apostolic power
[1:20:51] returns to the church it's when the
[1:20:53] government shall be upon his shoulders
[1:20:59] I want you to think how powerful
[1:21:02] what I just give you is that is when the
[1:21:05] church the real true church speaks in
[1:21:08] his power is when the government is back
[1:21:12] in the body again and what was he doing
[1:21:15] throughout the seven Church ages he was
[1:21:17] building a body he would sell on top of
[1:21:21] sale in Wesley it was sale on top of
[1:21:23] sail in Luther it would sell on top of
[1:21:26] sale in the Pentecostal in the
[1:21:28] restoration of the gifts but notice that
[1:21:32] the body has come back to full adoption
[1:21:34] again and the headship has found a body
[1:21:38] that it can lay down in and rest in
[1:21:43] that's what Isaiah told us that this
[1:21:45] would be the rest where the stammering
[1:21:47] lips and an unknown tongue well I speak
[1:21:50] unto my people that in the last days I
[1:21:53] saw Joe said that in the last days I
[1:21:55] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[1:21:59] All Flesh and my sons and daughters
[1:22:02] shall prophesy May old men shall see
[1:22:04] dreams my young men shall see visions
[1:22:06] and to think that this is the day when
[1:22:09] there's a people that is not ashamed
[1:22:13] to be called The Church of the Living
[1:22:16] God for it is the power of Salvation and
[1:22:20] it comes in demonstration and by the
[1:22:22] works of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:26] God don't need your attitude God don't
[1:22:28] need your signs God don't need your idea
[1:22:30] or only God needs is for you to yield
[1:22:33] your life
[1:22:38] God can use anybody here in this
[1:22:40] building
[1:22:42] and he's wanting you to experience him
[1:22:44] like never before
[1:22:46] [Music]
[1:22:48] foreign
[1:22:51] ever fell off a 40-foot ladder
[1:22:55] there's only one person in the building
[1:22:56] that could say they did that
[1:23:00] I can imagine what it felt like
[1:23:05] but I can't testify every little pain
[1:23:07] that he went through
[1:23:10] I'm talking about brother Ron if you
[1:23:11] don't know
[1:23:13] the guy over there in the corner that
[1:23:15] Satan's raging about
[1:23:17] I've tried everything I can but I still
[1:23:19] can't get him
[1:23:22] now I can't tell you I was there on the
[1:23:25] outside and I was looking in and I've
[1:23:27] seen the
[1:23:28] thing that was going through I can't
[1:23:30] tell you what it's like to go through a
[1:23:32] burning fire but I was looking on the
[1:23:34] outside looking in
[1:23:35] but if you hear his testimony he was
[1:23:38] there it happened to him and there's no
[1:23:41] devil that can rob this Pentecostal a
[1:23:44] blessing away from the Church of the
[1:23:46] Living God because we were there we met
[1:23:48] the same one that Mary met we said met
[1:23:51] the same one that Peter met we met the
[1:23:53] same one that was up there on the road
[1:23:56] to Damascus and stopped Paul writing his
[1:23:58] tracks
[1:24:00] I experienced it
[1:24:07] his Apostolic age is not going to cease
[1:24:11] it's still in a body right now
[1:24:14] you see what Christianity is it's
[1:24:16] tabernacling almighty God you see to be
[1:24:20] a Christian means to be christ-like it's
[1:24:22] tabernacling deity in you the holy ghost
[1:24:25] that fell on the day of Pentecost not
[1:24:28] some emotion but a real Pentecost notice
[1:24:31] what Jesus said when he was speaking to
[1:24:33] our church age he said behold I stand at
[1:24:36] the door and knock and if any man hear
[1:24:38] my voice and open the door I will come
[1:24:41] in and sup with him and he with me
[1:24:43] notice what brother random said he said
[1:24:46] that's the message to the Pentecostal
[1:24:48] church not try to revive the Pentecostal
[1:24:51] organization but revive the Pentecostal
[1:24:54] blessing in an individual heart he said
[1:24:57] that's the only way and I will sup with
[1:24:59] him and he with me now what is God
[1:25:03] wanting to do he was wanting to Veil
[1:25:05] himself in humanity
[1:25:11] all right he's wanting to Veil himself
[1:25:16] in you
[1:25:19] and it doesn't matter where you came
[1:25:21] from
[1:25:22] it doesn't matter what teachings you
[1:25:23] were raised up under it doesn't matter
[1:25:25] what kind of creed or what kind of Dogma
[1:25:27] that you came out of as long as you came
[1:25:30] out
[1:25:31] but God is not going to leave you where
[1:25:34] he found you you see there there was a
[1:25:37] whole lot of scars in your life there's
[1:25:39] a whole lot of things that are laying
[1:25:40] there
[1:25:42] but look at Moses's life he was known as
[1:25:45] a murderer he was known as a runaway
[1:25:48] Prophet but God wanted to Veil himself
[1:25:51] in
[1:25:53] in Moses he was wanting to Veil himself
[1:25:57] in Moses and when Moses went back there
[1:26:00] and grabbed the anointing of almighty
[1:26:03] God when he goes up there on the
[1:26:05] mountain
[1:26:06] and he turned aside to see a burning
[1:26:09] bush
[1:26:10] what did he do he come back under the
[1:26:13] anointing of the call that he was in of
[1:26:16] the prophet of that day and notice what
[1:26:18] Moses did he'd come back off of that
[1:26:21] mountain speaking thus say of the Lord
[1:26:23] and he'd come back under the inspiration
[1:26:25] of the anointing that he was living in
[1:26:27] in that day and Moses went out there and
[1:26:30] to think that the word that I am
[1:26:32] preaching to you
[1:26:34] is what Moses grabbed inspiration from
[1:26:38] to think that he went all the way back
[1:26:40] into the Garden of Eden and had
[1:26:42] conversations with Adam now how in the
[1:26:45] world could he do that when he was 400
[1:26:47] years from Abraham
[1:26:49] but he was inspired by almighty God to
[1:26:52] go back there and grab the anointing and
[1:26:55] tell us what happened in the Garden of
[1:26:57] Eden to tell us what happened with Cain
[1:26:59] to tell us what happened with Abraham to
[1:27:02] think that Moses grabbed the inspiration
[1:27:04] and he was inspired to speak
[1:27:07] the first five books of the Bible
[1:27:12] and over three quarters of it Moses
[1:27:14] wasn't even there
[1:27:16] but Moses had become veiled by almighty
[1:27:20] God when he come up off that mountain
[1:27:22] they said no
[1:27:24] they seen so much of God on Moses they
[1:27:27] said look man you got to put a veil over
[1:27:29] him we can't we can't stand to look on
[1:27:32] the way he's his face is shining he had
[1:27:34] so much God about him that he was had to
[1:27:37] Veil himself but today the world can't
[1:27:40] recognize almighty God because it's
[1:27:43] veiled in body form again
[1:27:46] what is it they missed Jesus when he was
[1:27:49] here because of the veil I say this that
[1:27:52] God in morphe is veiled in the body of
[1:27:55] Jesus Christ and Satan and all the
[1:27:58] enemies recognize that there is a power
[1:28:01] there is a power that they've watched
[1:28:03] from the very beginning
[1:28:08] imagine the jealous spirit
[1:28:10] that killed Cain or a Cain that rose up
[1:28:13] in Cain that killed Abel
[1:28:15] it rose up in Judas it rose up in the
[1:28:17] Pharisees it's the same jealous spirit
[1:28:20] that is trying to come in and stop the
[1:28:22] very move of God he'll try to come in
[1:28:24] and stop the Pentecostal blessings it
[1:28:26] tries to come in and shout shoutings and
[1:28:28] stop trying to stop shoutings try to
[1:28:30] stop groans try to stop weeping and
[1:28:33] start trying to stop prayer meetings
[1:28:35] it's amazing that the jealous spirit is
[1:28:39] wanting to keep you from the blessings
[1:28:41] that God has already poured out on you
[1:28:44] now I've already told you that God ain't
[1:28:46] gonna take nothing back
[1:28:48] God ain't returning anything God ain't
[1:28:50] saying no she didn't meet the bill this
[1:28:52] one didn't match no I want you to know
[1:28:55] what your Prophet said for you he said
[1:28:57] you're more than a Max for your enemy
[1:28:59] when your Tabernacle with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:01] and I'll say this I'll take any of our
[1:29:04] little girls over top of every Pope
[1:29:07] that's ever been they've got so much
[1:29:09] power they don't need to create
[1:29:10] squirrels but just create an overcoming
[1:29:13] life
[1:29:17] Hallelujah
[1:29:24] failed right here in humanity
[1:29:27] Moses do you watch the characteristics
[1:29:30] you watch the characteristics in nature
[1:29:33] you can watch you can watch deer in the
[1:29:35] summertime or in springtime when Annie
[1:29:37] got when the bucket he got his antlers
[1:29:39] on his head yet but you can tell the
[1:29:41] difference in them because nature tells
[1:29:42] of the characteristics of it
[1:29:44] you watch you can do you could see a
[1:29:46] bird flying and you can tell the
[1:29:48] difference between a crow and a dove
[1:29:50] because of the characteristics of it you
[1:29:52] can tell by the way they eat the
[1:29:54] characteristics of it you can look at a
[1:29:56] humanity and you can see all kinds of
[1:29:58] things they can Bob their hair off
[1:30:00] they can paint themselves up but you
[1:30:03] recognize what they really are I'm
[1:30:04] saying a whole lot to you without saying
[1:30:06] it but they can try to hide up in there
[1:30:08] all they want to but their
[1:30:10] characteristics show what's hidden on
[1:30:12] the inside of them and notice that God
[1:30:15] was so veiled in Morris and Moses that
[1:30:18] it showed the very characteristics of
[1:30:20] almighty God
[1:30:21] you see what brother random said he said
[1:30:23] when he come when Moses come on the
[1:30:25] scene he had the Revelation and he met
[1:30:27] the pillar fire and it was revealed to
[1:30:30] Moses it was revealed to Moses he met
[1:30:32] God in the form of the pillar of Fire
[1:30:36] he said watch he said watch the Creator
[1:30:39] he said watch the characteristics of God
[1:30:41] he picked up a handful of dust and he
[1:30:44] throwed it in the air and he turned and
[1:30:45] it turned into fleas the curator
[1:30:48] characteristics of God was in Moses
[1:30:51] now how can man act that way how can the
[1:30:55] word of man act that way unless God is
[1:30:58] backing up what that man said
[1:31:00] now how can a man take fleas when there
[1:31:03] ain't no fleas and take dust and all of
[1:31:06] a sudden speak it and take up dust and
[1:31:08] there's fleas flying everywhere or
[1:31:10] there's frogs jumping everywhere oh
[1:31:13] there's blue flies bloating everybody in
[1:31:15] the country because there was a man that
[1:31:19] was veiled with almighty God
[1:31:22] you see it wasn't Moses speaking it was
[1:31:25] the voice behind the voice in Moses that
[1:31:28] was speaking through Moses
[1:31:30] you begin to think about this and here's
[1:31:32] the phenomena of it that Moses began to
[1:31:35] speak and all of a sudden these things
[1:31:36] come into action it was God's voice
[1:31:39] operating in humanity what was it when
[1:31:42] William Branham was up there and he was
[1:31:44] studying on that on that thought of Mark
[1:31:46] 11 and 22 and 23 it was the sovereignty
[1:31:50] of almighty God
[1:31:53] Colorado mountain when he was up there
[1:31:56] in that Storm and The Voice told him to
[1:31:58] go back up there where he came from it
[1:32:00] was the sovereignty of almighty God now
[1:32:02] why can't the Catholics tap into that
[1:32:05] because they've never had a restoration
[1:32:07] but there is a body on Earth today that
[1:32:11] is in full restoration the fruit is at
[1:32:13] the top of the tree we know who we are
[1:32:15] we know what God wants us to do
[1:32:24] what was it in Moses
[1:32:26] it was the character characteristics
[1:32:29] of God
[1:32:33] what was it and what was it
[1:32:36] when Abraham was sitting at a tent
[1:32:41] he's setting out a tent
[1:32:43] and he hears a voice speaking to him
[1:32:47] and God wants to take flesh
[1:32:50] he wants to take 16.
[1:32:52] elements of the world and step into it
[1:32:55] and have communion with his son
[1:33:00] how did Abraham know
[1:33:02] he'd watch the actions of the voice that
[1:33:04] spoke to him all of his life
[1:33:07] foreign
[1:33:09] how do you know
[1:33:11] who's leading you
[1:33:15] how do you know that that's brought you
[1:33:17] to this message
[1:33:18] it's the one that's kept you all of your
[1:33:20] days
[1:33:24] he's never LED one of his children out
[1:33:26] of the way
[1:33:31] now notice
[1:33:32] and he comes and sits with his back
[1:33:35] turn to the tent
[1:33:39] I said why did your wife Sarah laugh
[1:33:42] Sarah said I didn't laugh
[1:33:46] brother said she was back here
[1:33:48] snickering up her arm up her sleeve
[1:33:50] there
[1:33:52] she says I didn't laugh
[1:33:54] you know God could have killed her right
[1:33:55] there
[1:33:57] but because she was a part of the
[1:33:59] promise
[1:34:00] there was nothing that could happen to
[1:34:03] her
[1:34:04] and when God asked Sarah a question he
[1:34:07] said is there anything too hard for the
[1:34:10] Lord
[1:34:12] even though you've been 90 years old
[1:34:15] you've been believing this promise for
[1:34:17] 25 years don't you believe that when I
[1:34:20] bless you that you're blessed don't you
[1:34:23] recognize that running through your
[1:34:25] veins right now is the Royal Blood of
[1:34:28] almighty God and though the enemy may be
[1:34:31] putting Mind Games in you making you
[1:34:33] sick and tormenting you that there is a
[1:34:36] blessing of almighty God and he's got
[1:34:39] his back turned to the tenth and he
[1:34:41] knows the very secrets of your heart
[1:34:43] I'll say that he's still Hebrews 4 and
[1:34:46] 12 the word is a discerner of the
[1:34:49] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:34:52] if you know
[1:34:54] if you knew what Sarah was saying
[1:34:55] Charlie knows what you're thinking
[1:35:01] how many times
[1:35:02] did we hear our prophets and now I'll
[1:35:04] turn my back to the audience
[1:35:07] why don't you why don't you over there
[1:35:09] in the balcony why don't you go to
[1:35:11] believing for God for something real
[1:35:13] quick I'll turn my back to show you that
[1:35:16] the same angel that came and met them
[1:35:19] before that before they went down to
[1:35:22] Sodom and Gomorrah that same Angel is in
[1:35:25] the building and he turned us back and
[1:35:27] said you you've got this need I see you
[1:35:30] you're praying for your grandson and
[1:35:32] he's got he's got stroke-like conditions
[1:35:34] and this is going on
[1:35:37] ain't that right that's thus saith the
[1:35:39] Lord what is it now I'll turn my back
[1:35:42] again to you now you're dealing with
[1:35:43] heart trouble and you've been wondering
[1:35:45] and you've been wondering if the Holy
[1:35:47] Ghost is for you don't you worry the
[1:35:50] Holy Ghost is for you and he'll heal
[1:35:52] your heart troubles
[1:35:53] that was it it was the same Melchizedek
[1:35:56] operating in human flesh again
[1:36:01] hallelujah it's the most high in human
[1:36:05] flesh again
[1:36:06] it's God's voice in his body
[1:36:13] your bodies are the Tabernacle of the
[1:36:17] Dynamics
[1:36:18] I can't tell you how the car operates
[1:36:20] but I know it's got some power
[1:36:24] I know it's got some power I can't tell
[1:36:27] you everything about how the alternate
[1:36:28] alternator works and how all the belts
[1:36:31] are put together and how all the how all
[1:36:33] the nuts and the bolts are holding it
[1:36:34] together but I do know this that if
[1:36:37] there is a spark and there is gasoline
[1:36:39] and everything's in order all I've got
[1:36:42] to do is turn the key and go down the
[1:36:45] road and I believe that William Branham
[1:36:47] told us and showed us that this message
[1:36:49] is something that we can ride down the
[1:36:52] road and show these Pentecostal
[1:36:54] blessings off to every dead cold Creed
[1:36:57] out there inside the message and outside
[1:36:59] the message that this message has got
[1:37:02] the dynamic power of almighty God in it
[1:37:07] Glory
[1:37:10] Satan swore that he'd stop you
[1:37:13] same sword that he'd kill you he said
[1:37:16] he'd stop this message and stop the
[1:37:18] influence of the message
[1:37:25] and kill his power
[1:37:29] but let me let me read you a scripture
[1:37:31] Deuteronomy 33 and 29.
[1:37:34] happy or thou oh Israel who is like unto
[1:37:40] thee
[1:37:43] laughs
[1:37:44] hit your neighbor who's liking to me
[1:37:50] are you happy
[1:37:52] put a smile on your face it takes a
[1:37:54] whole lot more muscles to frown than it
[1:37:56] does to smile
[1:37:59] it'll do your heart good happy
[1:38:05] but I'm happy every day as I journey
[1:38:08] through this land
[1:38:09] I gotta turn my face upside down well
[1:38:13] the Journey's almost over and the
[1:38:16] battle's nearly won and I got a feeling
[1:38:18] down in my heart I've got to turn this
[1:38:20] frown around
[1:38:22] happy
[1:38:26] David said I was glad when they said
[1:38:28] unto me let us go to the house of the
[1:38:31] Lord
[1:38:31] [Applause]
[1:38:32] happy or thou Israel
[1:38:36] but you don't know what to come through
[1:38:38] happy are you Israel
[1:38:41] but Satan's been on my case happy Art
[1:38:45] Thou Israel Satan said he'd kill the
[1:38:47] power happy are you
[1:38:52] all people saved by the Lord the people
[1:38:54] of thy help who is the sword of thy
[1:38:58] Excellency and not enemy shall be found
[1:39:00] Liars unto thee and thou shalt tread
[1:39:03] upon their high places
[1:39:06] to think that the enemy said he was
[1:39:08] going to get above your high God and get
[1:39:11] above him and you are going to tread on
[1:39:13] his high spots the things that he's
[1:39:15] greatest at you are going to tread upon
[1:39:18] it
[1:39:21] you know that Jesus says 25 of Jesus's
[1:39:24] Ministry was casting out the devil
[1:39:27] 25 of it if it was in Jesus's Ministry
[1:39:31] it's in our ministry
[1:39:33] is that right if we're his body then we
[1:39:36] are to act like he acted and we are to
[1:39:38] cast out Satan just like he cast out
[1:39:40] Satan brother Raynham said well he said
[1:39:42] I come upon against one of the worst
[1:39:44] Devils that I'd ever come up against in
[1:39:46] my life he said he was biting he was
[1:39:48] spitting and he was doing all kinds of
[1:39:50] things and he was wrapped up in a
[1:39:51] straight jacket and the enemy was on the
[1:39:53] inside of him and he was called cursing
[1:39:55] and doing all of these things
[1:39:57] he said but notice he said I had a
[1:39:59] double witness he said that Christ died
[1:40:02] on the cross that Christ died on the
[1:40:04] cross to set that man free from that
[1:40:05] demon and I had met an angel up there in
[1:40:08] that cave that there would be nothing
[1:40:09] stand before my prayer he said I prayed
[1:40:12] for that man that was said in that
[1:40:13] lunatic condition he said I prayed for
[1:40:15] him cast the devil off of him and he was
[1:40:18] in his right mind
[1:40:21] you are Servants of the most high God
[1:40:23] when Paul was going on there on the way
[1:40:25] to Macedonia and there was a woman up
[1:40:27] there had a spirit of divination she
[1:40:30] followed Paul and Silas walking around
[1:40:32] all of them days and she began to
[1:40:35] prophesy or begin to speak out these are
[1:40:37] servants are the most high God now Paul
[1:40:40] Let It Go on just for a little bit and
[1:40:42] they followed him all around the city
[1:40:43] wherever she went but Paul finally had
[1:40:45] enough of it
[1:40:47] I'll tell you I know the devil knows who
[1:40:50] I am but every once in a while you got
[1:40:51] to get a break from that Old Rascal and
[1:40:54] Paul turned around and cursed that thing
[1:40:56] cast The Demon out of her life
[1:40:59] and instead of the people being excited
[1:41:02] about it the men that owned her that had
[1:41:05] gained much things by her by her spirit
[1:41:07] of divination they were upset and
[1:41:09] through Paul and silence on the inside
[1:41:11] of the jail the enemy might think he's
[1:41:13] got you but God's got a different plan
[1:41:16] and when Paul and Silas got a player
[1:41:19] when they threw him in a common prison
[1:41:20] they got a player and they begin to sing
[1:41:23] praises unto almighty God
[1:41:26] and about the Midnight Hour they've
[1:41:28] become a holy ghost breakout that broke
[1:41:31] the prison guard broke him out broke
[1:41:33] Paul out broke every enemy broke every
[1:41:36] prisoner in there out
[1:41:38] because they were praising the most high
[1:41:40] God now to think that the enemies put
[1:41:43] them in there trying to stop the
[1:41:45] blessings of God but Paul walked out
[1:41:47] there and Silas walked out there and
[1:41:49] they took the prison guard and they
[1:41:51] baptized him and his family in the name
[1:41:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ and the enemy
[1:41:56] thought he was going to win but God
[1:41:58] meant it for his good
[1:42:04] foreign
[1:42:13] holy power surrounding in the church
[1:42:16] that'll make demons flee
[1:42:18] he said but instead of that it's become
[1:42:19] a laughing stock he said what is it it's
[1:42:22] the mechanics instead of the Dynamics
[1:42:30] who's in charge here
[1:42:34] who's in charge here
[1:42:36] has God lost control or is there he
[1:42:38] letting another uh he's already letting
[1:42:40] another Power be in Supreme control
[1:42:45] either God is God or he or he ain't
[1:42:50] either God still gives a holy ghost
[1:42:51] story don't
[1:42:53] either God still delivers from cancer or
[1:42:55] he don't
[1:42:57] who's in charge here and it looks like
[1:42:59] Satan's on the Rampage and it looks like
[1:43:01] he's going to win who's in charge here
[1:43:04] we were not put here to be ran over and
[1:43:08] to be brow beaten by the enemy and for
[1:43:10] him to beat us down and tell us that
[1:43:12] we'll never be enough we were put here
[1:43:14] to be Serpent bruisers and to put Satan
[1:43:18] underneath of our feet put put
[1:43:20] depression underneath of our feet to put
[1:43:22] oppression anxiety
[1:43:25] if cancer couldn't stand in front of
[1:43:27] William branham's prayer and the angel
[1:43:29] that met him is in this room there'll be
[1:43:32] no cancer that can stand in front of the
[1:43:35] Church of the Living God

[1:46:06] going to have to keep your hands for
[1:46:07] clapping
[1:46:10] that okay
[1:46:15] just go reading Psalms chapter 47 one
[1:46:18] time
[1:46:19] rejoice
[1:46:21] all clapping to the Lord for he is a god
[1:46:24] of Triumph
[1:46:25] I know what I'm talking about
[1:46:31] you're not Clapping Your Hands to me
[1:46:33] you're Clapping Your Hands to the
[1:46:35] almighty God
[1:46:37] and if Satan could he'd stop you from
[1:46:39] doing that he'd keep you set it in your
[1:46:42] Pew and not believing what I've told to
[1:46:44] you that you are tabernacling the most
[1:46:46] high God
[1:46:51] Deuteronomy 31 and 19. notice God
[1:46:54] commanded Moses says notice when they
[1:46:57] come out of Egypt in Egypt and they come
[1:46:59] over against the Red Sea and they come
[1:47:01] over in Exodus 15 they begin to sing the
[1:47:03] song of Moses
[1:47:06] and that is where we watch the greatest
[1:47:09] Triumph
[1:47:11] of 600 sisters 600 000 sisters
[1:47:15] beating on tambourines
[1:47:17] don't you tell me we can't do it
[1:47:21] dancing
[1:47:22] on the shores of
[1:47:24] tea because
[1:47:25] cancer they watch tuberculosis they
[1:47:28] launch they watched anxiety they watch
[1:47:31] depression as it was being defeated and
[1:47:34] they happily danced over their enemy
[1:47:41] Hallelujah and they sang the song of
[1:47:44] Moses now notice notice what he says
[1:47:46] here in Deuteronomy 31 and 19. he said
[1:47:49] now therefore write this song for you
[1:47:51] and teach it to your children of Israel
[1:47:53] he said put it in their mouths that this
[1:47:56] song may be a witness for me against the
[1:48:00] children of Israel now notice God is
[1:48:03] wanting you to sing
[1:48:05] God's wanting you to put this on your
[1:48:07] lips and teach it to your children
[1:48:11] there's something about that little song
[1:48:13] Mary Had a Little Lamb or that little
[1:48:15] song I I got a little light and I'm not
[1:48:17] gonna I'm gonna let it shine every child
[1:48:19] remembers it
[1:48:21] you see God knows that there's power in
[1:48:24] sin and if you can go to singing and put
[1:48:26] it upon your children's lips what is it
[1:48:28] you are singing the praises to the most
[1:48:31] high God now notice he said write this
[1:48:34] song for you put it and teach it to your
[1:48:36] children put it in their mouths now
[1:48:39] notice the Bible tells us over and over
[1:48:40] again now the word of God is Not thee
[1:48:43] even in thy mouth
[1:48:45] turn of me and Moses to death not Moses
[1:48:48] but Deuteronomy 32 and 8.
[1:48:51] and Moses took up his pen and composed
[1:48:55] this song
[1:48:58] when the most highly Heart Divided to
[1:49:02] the Nations they are inherited when he
[1:49:04] celebrated the sons of Adam and he set
[1:49:07] the bounds of the people according to
[1:49:09] the number of his children Israel for
[1:49:12] the Lord's portion is his people
[1:49:17] the Lord's portion is his people
[1:49:22] the Lord's portion is his people Jacob
[1:49:24] is a lot of his inheritance he found him
[1:49:27] in the desert land and it is a waste
[1:49:29] howling Wilderness he led him about he
[1:49:32] instructed him he kept him as the apple
[1:49:34] of his eye
[1:49:38] and your Prophet came to this generation
[1:49:40] and he preached this message right here
[1:49:43] over and over and over again as an eagle
[1:49:45] stirreth up her nest and floodeth over
[1:49:48] her young spread with her broad her
[1:49:50] wings taketh them and bear them on her
[1:49:53] wings so the Lord did lead him and there
[1:49:56] was no strange god with him
[1:49:58] William Branham grabbed the inspiration
[1:50:01] of Moses's song and spoke to this
[1:50:04] generation it's time to fly only an
[1:50:07] eagle can come up this High only the
[1:50:09] anointed can fly here
[1:50:12] you're not a birth bound chicken
[1:50:15] we've had enough intellectual I'm taught
[1:50:17] intellectualism taught to us to starve
[1:50:20] every chicken and to choke out every
[1:50:21] chicken there is in this land but you
[1:50:24] have been stirred up by a word of
[1:50:26] Prophecy
[1:50:28] El eleon has called you his portion El
[1:50:31] eleon says you're his children Elion
[1:50:34] says you're the apple of his eye
[1:50:38] if Eliana says anything to you you can
[1:50:42] take it to the bank because it's coming
[1:50:43] to pass
[1:50:48] it's time
[1:50:50] to fly
[1:50:58] it's time to fly higher
[1:51:03] it's taking the time to sit back and
[1:51:05] wonder when the days of Miracles are
[1:51:06] they're right now this ain't the time to
[1:51:09] sit here and wonder well if we'd only
[1:51:11] been here when William Branham was here
[1:51:13] I'll say the god of William branham's in
[1:51:15] this room
[1:51:17] I'll say that he's more than able to do
[1:51:19] exceedingly abundantly above all that
[1:51:21] you could ever ask or think I believe
[1:51:23] that by my prayer that cancer can leave
[1:51:25] the body in this room right now
[1:51:28] I believe that whatever you have need of
[1:51:30] if you ask it in his name it'll be done
[1:51:33] right now
[1:51:34] if it can't be done then what are we
[1:51:37] doing here
[1:51:40] if he's not the god of Elijah then why'd
[1:51:43] he send us Elijah
[1:51:45] if he came to it then why to create
[1:51:47] squirrels
[1:51:48] if you can't make tumors dissolved then
[1:51:51] why'd he show it to us in the prophecy
[1:51:52] of men at William Branham

[1:52:19] prophet's message

[1:52:35] mighty acts amongst the Church of the
[1:52:38] Living God I'm not trying to stir you up
