house lord disappointed time and to be able to fellowship here again lord this this fall and winter lord as we have so many before but lord it just seems like maybe this time is a little more special lord i'm just trusting today lord that you would come father as you dropped in the truck with me and brother andrew today lord and your presence lord is so real to us and we thank you for that lord god we need you to come once again this evening lord we've we felt your lord in the songs and in the worship but lord we need you to come break the bread of life now though lord for truly it's more than a man could do if a man lord was to read it lord it'd just be words but if you would come lord and may your anointing fall upon it god may it not just be words upon the hearers hearts but lord may it become life to us tonight lord may lord it charges with something greater than we've ever experienced before and father i pray now lord you would bless the reading of the word bless everything that's said and done tonight lord may i give you glory and honor and we'll give you the praise for it lord for we'll say thank you for it for it's in jesus christ's name and the saints said amen amen amen if you have your bibles turn with me to mark chapter 11 okay they want me to use this thing just take it all off just pull it i want the jacket too huh can't fight with bound up anyhow man don't make me nervous i just want to say i want to thank brother ron and brother and sister connie and and brother andrew and sister katie and for the great hospitality this weekend and and just always truly a blessing to come you know it's kind of like we're not we're not physically related but we are related amen is kind of like adopted parents almost man maybe i'll just be their adopted son i don't know anyhow we just enjoy being with them and encountered a great honor and good to see you brother steven and it's been a long time a year but it seems like a long time and and we're certainly just glad to be in the house of the lord let's just turn to the word now as we read in mark chapter 11 verse 22 and 23 very familiar scriptures but i just pray tonight that something would be said to encourage you and give you faith to press the battle man we didn't come here to edify ourselves we come here to edify christ and if we build christ up that'll build you up amen mark 11 22 and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but he but but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith those are powerful words if you can believe in your heart whatever you've asked you can have it may the lord jesus had his blessing tonight you may be seated i'd like to speak this evening on if i can and it may continue toward tomorrow but i want to speak on the key to your miracle is the channel of inspiration and i want to read you a quote brother adam talks about and modern events are made clear by prophecy he says the bible is to be revealed by inspiration and that's the only thing inspiration jesus told peter upon this rock this rock of revelation reveals who he is and as we as we speak tonight now on the key to your miracle i clicked over into the bible today and as with brother andrew and we i was looking up this he was in the suit store and i was studying and he said i'm sorry i'm taking so long i said honestly no problem i'm studying so that that's fine and i clicked on the word miracle in the new testament and it's actually dominant dumas which means a force specifically a miraculous power used by implication a miracle itself the ability the abundance the meaning the might the workers of a miracle is power strength violence and a mighty wonderful work and brother branham would come along and tell us that a miracle is something that's not understood it's a paradox it's something that happens yet there's no scientific proof that it could be that way but we're not going by scientific proof we're going by revelation of the word of god god inspires it to your heart and you believe it and that settles it now the bible tells us excuse me that men of old were moved by the holy ghost so the bible was written by the prophets down through the ages but it was actually god speaking to the prophets and if god spoke the word and it become the written word it must come to pass god spoke again in this day through a prophet which we're all aware of and if he's taught listen brother ben said if it's truly god it'll be exactly like it said so there's no questioning whether the message is correct or not we all believe that and if we don't access you do by the end of the service so when a prophet speaks something you can write it down take it to the bank and it's going to be that way you don't have to wonder well i wonder if he hid it i wonder if he missed it no he hit it if he's in that channel of inspiration it'll be exactly like he said it it's like simeon of old in the bible he knew he was going to see the coming of the lord jesus he's an old man and god reveals it to him you're going to see the coming of the lord jesus and he began telling people i will see the coming of the lord jesus to the point that people thought he was crazy but he said he believed it anyhow let me just stop and put something right here two years ago in just a couple of days the lord jesus of the angel spoke to brother ron and said if you trust me with your life i'll use you like never before. amen you're all witnesses of that brother said how is it happening it's happening listen it's a paradox what's taking place it's something that we can't understand but yet it's god it's nothing i can produce it's nothing brother ron can produce but that's what god said it and god is fulfilling it people think we're crazy that's okay because i think they are you think i'm crazy enough well i might think you are see that thing goes both ways but it's not about whether you think i'm crazy or i think you're crazy it's about what did god say in his word and god said i'm the lord thy god that he love all thy diseases [Applause] we need miracles in our lives we need miracles in this church your pastor needs a miracle i might need a miracle whoever might need a miracle but there's a key to that we have to get into the channel of inspiration until god would speak to us and then we without even questioning it speak it and then you watch god back it up simon's like you know what i know i'm old and i'm and people think i'm crazy but i'm still going to see jesus and one day he walked into the temple and all of a sudden here came mary in and revelation struck him that's the one and he ran over and he grabbed the child and he held him in his arms and he said mine eyes have seen the salvation thy salvation he knew what it was because he knew god had revealed it to him that he was going to see the christ before he died and that was it he's ready to die now because he had seen the promised word of god we'll see what brother abraham says and i have heard but now i see he said now when you're prayed for you don't have to run back through a prayer line or let somebody else pray for you when you know you've done exactly what god told you to do if you're doing what god told you to do you've done it god told you to do it then wait for that channel of inspiration to open up to you and now i'm healed and he said and when that drops in there it's all over all right it's all over oh you don't need no prayer lines you don't need nothing else it's over why because it's been revealed to you when you hit the channel of inspiration now it's been personally revealed to you that's like it was when you first saw this message i don't know some of you i see some new faces i hadn't seen there before some moved in but god knows your story and god knows where you've been at and god knows what you've struggled with and god knows how to get you to overcome and god knows everything that you had need of before the foundation of the world and he knew that one night he would drop channel of that inspiration would jump right down inside of you and you would walk out of here a completely whole different person completely over with i'm healed i'm saved i'm delivered i'm whatever you whatever it is put it there let me read you one now one more out of jehovah jiren 1955. he said it is only the love of our father that loves you so much that he sends his word he sends his ministers to preach the word and then he sends gifts into the church with his arms spread out trying to get you to believe it he wants to heal you tonight you ready for the next line a thousand times more than you want to be healed brother ron just think how much you want god to heal you tonight he wants to heal you a thousand times more well jason what's hindered all we need is to drop into that channel and you can't make yourself get in the channel see that's the deal people want to try to pull themselves into that you can't make yourself have a revelation it takes god at that direct moment and that direct second to give you that revelation now god's using this man like never before because that's what he told him he would do and we see it all around the world thousands have hope tonight that they can overcome cancer thousands have hoped that they can still stand behind the pulpit and preach the gospel regardless what their problems are but god ain't done yet i said god ain't done yet god still got things to work he's still got things to do i believe so so while he's here now he wants to hear you a thousand times more than you want to be healed but you're afraid see you want to go by how you feel because you've regarded that you've lived by your feelings your whole life has been wrapped up in that but you must get away from that and act on god's word not on what you feel we've all heard brother ram say i'm so sick tonight i'm just hanging onto this pulpit and my knuckles are turning white he was sick and he'd say well i got to go down there and preach tonight i have a message on my heart he'd come down brother neville graciously would ask him to preach because he knew if he put god first god take care of the rest and i've seen a man stand behind the pulpit for a year and a half now or longer i knowing he don't feel like getting up and preaching every sunday or every saturday but god will reward that sacrifice listen and thank god that he placed a man of god among you that loves the lord jesus and loves this congregation let me tell you god ain't through yet god's gonna get a channel of inspiration in the house of god and somebody is gonna step in that channel said you must get away from that and act on god's word not what you feel not what you see that's what he preached on just a couple of weeks ago or last week not what you feel not what you see but what god said act on that make a confession of that confession means to say the same thing and god said i've already healed you so whatever your need might be you begin to confess that over and over and over i heard him say i'm driving up here from from home he said you know what you just keep knocking on the door of god and you say lord i'm having a good time knocking and you put yourself on god's hands and he said god has got to get you off of his hands so he's got to move somehow or another god i'm going to keep knocking i hope you're getting tired of hearing me because i i'm really enjoying it lord i'm ready for my channel i'm ready to step into it lord i need god to let everything else go i need to focus my life upon you lord i need to quit looking at everything around me and i need to focus on the word of god and when it's been revealed to you that you yourself has received god's promise he said that's the inspiration you being a christian he said it struck you might not strike an unbeliever like that but it struck you and he said and the only thing you need to do is open up your heart for the mechanics are ready let the inspiration drop in which is the dynamics let that drop on the inside of you and then nothing he said can change your mind once that strikes once it's right here nobody can change it the doctor walks in and goes well you got about five minutes i preached a man's funeral the other day who would 26 months ago the doctors told him he had six months he lived another 20 months on hospice the entire time but he lived it and he you know he didn't go when he first told him he would go he wasn't ready to go because it got down to about the last couple weeks of his life and all of a sudden it struck him one day i'm not afraid to die anymore he was scared to death to die but he got to the point he said i'm not afraid to die he done made his calling and his election short he wasn't scared anymore inspiration struck me old man the chaplain of the hospice guy had up and he said he said you know what he said dawn's been afraid to die for forever ever since he's been here he said but he's he's outlived i've never had a patient that's lived this long ever and you've been doing it a long time but you might not i never had a patient that was a seed gene of god that had to come to the realization of who he was and come to the point that he said no matter what happens to me i'm ready to go nothing then can change your mind job needed that channel of inspiration job was a man we all know the story of job how he had everything he lost everything he had a way of moving himself out though and letting the word of god move in one day all he'd done lost everything just about one day his best buddies come to him job you're a secret center troop said no you've missed that one oh boy i've checked my life i made the sacrifices all right i didn't just make them for myself i made them for my children pre-eventually they would do it wrong lord let me make a sacrifice for him and job made sure he had all the t's crossed and the eyes dotted and job said well you know what you can say what you want but i'm telling you right now i've got everything right no job no you're missing something you're missing something you're missing you're a secret for if you weren't a secret sinner all these things wouldn't be happening to you even to the point to miss job said curse god and die and a lot of people always look down on this joe because she said curse god and die but let me tell you brother brian told us that the the lady is the weaker vessel so she was she was crushing underneath that pressure seeing her husband in that condition seeing him lose everything he had and all of a sudden though job said woman you speak like a foolish woman he didn't call her foolish you speak like a foolish woman and revelation begins striking him [Music] revelation began heading home to him i tell you what yeah i might be down here on the high street and i might have balls from head to toe and i might have lost everything i've ever had but blessed be the name of the lord for the lord giveth and the lord taketh and then he begin to prophesy naked come i into the world naked shall i go out of the world but blessed be the name of the lord and about that time a vision opened up the prophet of god said he caught a revelation of what a resurrection was going to be and when he caught that revelation inspiration he got in that channel hallelujah and when job got in the channel could nothing get him out of the channel let me tell you until it all come to pass and god began to restore all that he lost and he didn't just restore it he multiplied it see god's not going to put you through something and not give you a boost after you come out of it god don't put you through a storm to leave you shipwrecked and beaten and down in despair but god puts you in a storm to bring you out on the other side even a better man than you was when you went through it because that's how god works god does this it's his doing he does it that he might get all the glory that came fresh right there as long as god's in it don't worry don't worry about it it's usually when trouble comes they want to disagree with you when trouble comes in that's how your friends are when you get your back against the wall then they want to start saying maybe maybe maybe them aren't friends them are enemies for a true friend no matter what you're going through will be like david was when he began to speak about the lord though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me you want to know who your real friends are getting a battle when your back's against the wall get one all hails against you and then watch men of god and ladies of god stand up and say i'll stand by them i'll fight with them devil says well i'll just start a rumor go ahead devil started i've had plenty of rumors started i'm sure brother ron has whether andrew has any minister has but you don't let it affect you and you don't preach from a standpoint of a complex trying to destroy another person because that person's not even in your congregation nine times out of ten so you're never gonna help the people sitting there but we didn't come to pass somebody else for what they did in the past but we come tonight that we might identify the body to build you up and to give you faith to know that no matter what happens god's still with you and when that pulsation began to happen inside of job he knew god's voice and nobody brother nathanael could tell him otherwise when he saw it when he knew it was the voice he'd heard god's voice do you think you could have been wrong job you think you missed that just a little bit job said you know what i went a long time and i couldn't get the inspiration on me but now it's on me and i know what it feels like when it comes and i didn't miss it i hit it just right and i don't know how long it's going to take because god didn't say how long it took to give him everything back but god said he restored everything back so it's not image it's immaterial how long it takes what's the point is is at the end you've got it all back i don't know how long it's going to be before he's able to go out and preach conventions four or five knots in a row i'm not interested in that what i'm interested in is that he makes it there and listen when inspiration strikes your heart that's all you're concerned with i know he's gonna be there [Applause] that's what we're trusting in it's god to get the enemy out of the way because they'll accuse you day and night they'll ridicule you they'll make fun of you but let me tell you when his best friend come down there and begin rebuking him inspiration struck him nothing could take that out of job's heart when inspiration finally struck brother branham would put it this way sometimes these great pulsations of faith come right in the time of crises right in a time where it's all bleak that pulsation of faith has begun to rise reminds me of the couple they were sitting there and the nurse had come in and said your son's about to die looked at the machine all the numbers were looking bad about that time brother branham walked in the room brother branham are so glad you're here would you pray for her son he gets down and begins praying he rises up he said well brother branham thank god for healing my son the nurse said sir you don't understand that machine says he's going to die and brother brown says or the man tells you he said honey you don't understand that machine might say he's going to die but god has said he's going to live and when god says he's going to live that's what he was looking at you know the rest of the story he went home the next day well completely well we find in those real hours of stress that's when usually god moves in and begins to drive back the fire at those hebrew children they they got right down until they actually stepped in the fire excuse me it wasn't about they were about to get in the fire and he came they got in the fire and he was there see he didn't have to he didn't have to i said well i wonder if he'll be there no they said we don't know if he'll be there but we know where god's able but either way o king we're not going to bow down and worship your fake god we're not going to bow down and worship the god of later asea we're not going to bow down and worship anything else but we know one thing for sure our god is able [Applause] and brother man puts it like this when he moves he moves when the hebrew children walked in god moved and the old king goes down and he looks and goes hey say did we not throw three men in the fire yeah well there's a fourth one in there that looks like how did he know what he looked like he looks like the son of god how did he get in there didn't we throw three and we threw three we better get them out of there then because somebody's in there walking around they're having a revival they're having a holy ghost fit however you want to put it there was something they went inbound they walked out delivered they were loose from their vines that had them they went into the trial they went into the thing they were down they were beaten but they came out of it overcomers glory to god no weapon formed against you shall ever prosper when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard against it roses what is that sin well i'll just answer you with this brother madam said are you that standard me yeah you've become the word haven't you christ in you the hope of glory you're now his people see the elect of god in the days of noah's time and in moses is timing in jesus time in the apostles time and luther's time and once his time at pentecost's time he said there was a seed on the earth at that time they come forth under that inspiration but this is a different inspiration this is a different time this is the bride time this is the time when the bride's coming together this is the time when they're when they're rising up under rising up in the in his glory well bro just when i see ministers falling left and right god's rising up don't you get your eyes on what's happening around us that's exactly what the devil wants you to do look at this brother look at that sister no no you looked at jesus looked at jesus and lived inspiration struck goby had it when moses was standing here inspiration struck moses and he said stand still and see the glory of god he didn't know what he was saying he just opened his mouth and he spoke huh and you know what happened he said the enemy which you see today you'll see no more that's exactly what happened well ron that's going to be a great day when that cancer enemy you see today you see no more that's going to be a great day let me just tell you this right now if you've seen brother ron get happy and shout before he had cancer you just wait till the battle's over you just wait till inspiration strikes you wait till he hits that channel you wait till he walks out here one saturday night and says i'm cleared there's never been a stage four cancer patient healed yet there's fixing to be let me just put it this way there already is it's already done jesus did it at calvary so he's the unhealed estate for cancer oh we're just waiting for these bodies to recognize it yes brother on how you feeling i'm feeling great well jason that might be telling a story no it's not because i remember the prophet of god when he had that stomach condition i didn't intend for this to go exactly this way but it's not my it's not what i intend any house what god wants and here here it is and you know god knows exactly what's happening and brother brandon somebody come ask him how you feeling billy i'm healed cover it up i'm healed puke it up covered up puked it up covered it up someone said bill you're telling a lie he said jesus said he's the high priest of your confession and if you don't confess it he ain't obligated to do it you get that much revelation you're on the way he's the high priest of my confession i was a brother tim pritchard a while back and and we were in the office before i come out to preach and brother tim just we prayed like we usually do the ministers and all of a sudden he just grabs a hold of me and he says you demon of allergies because i've suffered with them ever since i was a child doctor said i'd grow out of them my dad goes how old are you going to have to get so he starts praying for me rebuking that devil rebuking that devil bill jason you're still clearing your throat tonight i don't care see what you don't understand is channel of inspirations came i'm just waiting for the fulfillment in this body because i know i'm already healed how do you know cause somebody done laid hands and prayed on me and i believed what they prayed so therefore i'm waiting for this just to finish up [Music] how you get around me some days you'd think i had covered one guy asked me cause you sure you're okay has i've been this way all my life i don't think it's covered if it is it's the longest case they've ever had in the last two years but when you're healed you're healed i see nothing can take that from you i remember one night i was driving home from church and i was sicker than a dog man it's been years ago we just got married we drove home from church that night and all of a sudden i just started praying i said lord i just want to open up moses's medical cabinet tonight well you said i'm the lord thy god that healeth all thy diseases and that old sick flu whatever it was left me instantly it just left it was completely gone listen when the inspiration strikes that's when you gotta move inspiration will start praying stop quoting the word faith began to build had a need joshua had a need one time he was in an hour of crisis was he not he's fighting a battle all of a sudden he runs out of daylight almost he says i ain't gonna get this battle done he speaks to the moon he speaks to the sun and it just stopped excuse me brother said i don't know how it stopped don't matter how it stopped it stopped how do you know it stopped the bible said it stopped and the bible is the inspired word of god and therefore i believe it so the stun stood still it was a paradox it was a miracle it was something that could not be explained but he believed it there was a need and he believed it and when he spoke it he didn't look around say well i wonder if that's going to happen [Music] it happened there was no question it happened and when it happens in your life you know it when god inspires you for something you know it and there ain't no weapon formed against you that can never take that out of your heart there's something down in there brother adam says this and i've heard but now i see he said the same thing in mark 11 23 if you say to this mountain [Music] believe what you've said now watch he says but you can't stand there and fumble in your mind and say it you've got to be inspired to say it and when you're inspired to say it it's different you could pray for somebody till you're blue in the face but all of a sudden something could change and you could hit that channel of inspiration and you could just say leave the devil ain't gonna scream eddie ain't gonna yell leave devil he leaves pretty simple that's the way it happened hattie wright was sitting there in the room one time brother was telling a story about how the squirrels was created you remember the story and all of a sudden she says brother behind him that's nothing but the truth wasn't there but she believed it i wasn't there in brother abraham's meetings but i believe it i didn't see all the miraculous things that he saw there i see what's happening now and i just have to believe it's the same god it's the same inspiration it's the same token that's been applied it'll do the same thing as it did then and for the first time the third pull is used upon a woman and she says that's nothing but the truth and brother brahman said hattie whatever you ask for the lord jesus just told me to tell you to give it to you he told me to give it to you god used a man to give it to the lady [Applause] if you believe word english language you have to believe that's what happened i'll give it to you brother brown what shall i ask for well there's your sister she's crippled didn't ring a bell you make 200 a year on your farm you could ask for a million dollars i don't know where it would come from but it'd be here in the next five minutes it would immediately appear on the table and she said i don't want money and i don't want something that's temporary she didn't utter those words maybe but that's what was in here how do you know brother jason by the choice she made because the next thing she said i just heard the prophet said he was those two boys are sitting over there laughing at what i was telling she looked around she sing those two boys brother rem said they were little rickies they got out in the world and just was at that point in time teenager he said all of a sudden she looked over and she's singing them she said brother random i want the salvation of them two boys huh see two predestinated seeds had a need and he's the same god so he calls the mama to say the right thing and she said i want the salvation of them two boys he said i give them to you in the name of jesus christ [Applause] if you're a bloodball son or daughter of god you have the ability to use the word let it become inspiration let you say i give it to you in the name of jesus arise take up your bad walk and he said i give them to you and immediately they fell across their lap and repented and was filled with the holy ghost brother jason i've been seeking the holy ghost for 25 years well the devil is going to trip me yet see how you got me when i got on that subject i've been seeking the holy ghost for 25 years well my question to you is why ain't you received it well i've been to youth camp i've been to family camp and i've been to all kinds of camps listen go in the camp don't give you the holy ghost you might get it at camp and you might get it in the church here tonight but the thing about us that don't give it to you when you have come under total obedience to the word of god he entitles you to the token so if you don't have it you're not in total obedience yet so the so the prophet said go back and repent again amen most people don't think if i get up and repent again what's god going to think at the day of judgment when he said i sent a little arkansas hillbilly who stumbled over his words and screams and yells and sweats because he's nervous i don't sweat because i'm i don't when i get anointed it don't make me sweat i sweat when i pick up a tool belt i always have it's just the jackson thing my little nephew said but when inspiration strikes you it's over with then you grab it and you run this is what he said this is what i'm going to believe i don't care what anybody else says i'm going to believe this message because when it became real to me it might not have become real to somebody else but when it becomes real to you you hang on to it you'll die for it if you ain't willing to die for it what's the problem why don't you got the holy ghost in repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and he shall give you the baptism of the holy ghost [Applause] pretty simple prescription but a lot of people are looking for something i'm looking for lightning to strike me i'm looking for a feeling come on i don't have it cause i ain't had the feeling when brother biscuit said how do you know if you got if you don't have it if you've repented and been baptized well protesting my desires have changed but i don't think i've got it yet excuse me what changed your desires your new spirit didn't change your desires your new spirit you'd go back to being a whoremonger you're going back to being a prostitute but once he comes in with the holy spirit to agree with a new spirit that he gave you there is no losing it you can't lose what god has sealed [Applause] you might shout and dance and run the pins benches and you might just sit there and cry i like it when they're shouting but shouting don't mean you're saved hey i tell the church all the time you think i'm crazy here you wait till i get over there you wait till i can't cough and pull a muscle you know you ever did that cough man i feel old but one of these mornings that ain't happening no more one of these mornings i'm going to be changed inspiration's already struck me on that i know in whom i have believed i've got the same revelation that job has i know my redeemer liveth and in this flesh shall i see god and him shall i see you not another it's gonna change one of these days i give you your boys in the name of jesus christ joshua had a need hattie right had a need sister mita had a need well she had a tumor started growing on her side on her left ovary brother and prayed and prayed and prayed it never left it just stayed there and then all of a sudden one night he gets down to pray by himself in the home he says lord you know how lonely i am you know my wife's gone you know she's going to the doctor tomorrow lord you see how bad she is all of a sudden he heard he felt that come in the room stand up he said i stood up and he said you say how to be and it'll be just that way and he said in the morning before the doctor's hand when he pulls the cover back before his hand touches her the tumor will be gone and you say brother this and that's just for brother random i defy that statement i've seen it work before i've seen under inspiration pray the same thing and god did the same thing listen god's no respect to person he didn't put these things here that we would just look at them as history but now they got to become life [Applause] doctor went to touch her couldn't find it nowhere looked at the scans couldn't even tell which side it was on he said meter all i know to tell you it was there and now it's gone and there's not even a trace of it left in your body [Applause] [Music] when it leaves when it leaves there ain't gonna be a trace of it any longer how cause jesus don't halfway do something god's able to do a complete work when it left she was perfect there was no surgery scar wasn't there i remember sister sheila mccomas had cancer two types of cancer she had female cancer she was eat up with it she had cancer on her kidney she come up wednesday night i think thursday or friday with surgery she come up wednesday night we prayed for her and in my prayer i remember saying before the doctor's hands touch i remembered that quote and i just quoted it and then the day of the surgery brother tim pruitt showed up and he was there and he prayed the exact same thing now let everything be established in the mouth of two witnesses and the doctor cuts her open looking at that kidney and he searches for an hour he says well it ain't there he gets another doctor to come in it ain't there when she comes to in recovery he says i'll tell you what happened you pray too [Applause] much let me tell you something doctor get the others on board huh cause our lord is able to heal and do exceedingly abundantly above all we can ever ask or think that's the kind of god he is just step into that inspiration can i have a few more minutes thank you i figured you'd say that's why i asked brother frank mccomas most a lot of you know him his mother passed away the other day and by the way she was a big fan of brother ron's she'd sit in a mcdonald's restaurant across the table from him or at the fellowship hall and just chit chat with him testifying to him powerful woman powerful back in 1964 though she had a wreck i believe it was and she became paralyzed she couldn't walk and they got a hold of brother behind him and he prayed for her over the phone and he told her he said marie in the morning get out of bed and fix your husband and them children breakfast before they go to school yeah she said okay brother she wakes up the next morning her feet still don't move her husband goes what are you going to do she goes you're going to take my feet and swing them over out of the bed inspiration doesn't struck her you're going to take my feet and swing them over out of the bed and when he swung her feet over out of the bed she stood up hallelujah and she walked since 1964 to this year until the lord took her home let me tell you that same lord jesus is here today she went blind one time and they sent work to brother brown he was up in the mountains he got the word and she's laying in a hospital room blind as a bat couldn't see nothing and she said all of a sudden that pillar of fire came in the room and opened her eyes up and come right over her eyes and opened them and when brother branham calls back she tells him what happened and he said what time was that she said two o'clock he said i was in the mountain praying for you at that time see god knows how to do it when inspiration strikes you like that there ain't no going back what about the inspiration that struck that little woman up in the balcony lady holding the baby up her crying is all fidgety and she said you know what she said something said pray for that baby she said well she's got a prayer card i don't want to pray for the holy spirit kept saying pray for the baby she said i'll give her my seat maybe that'll make me feel better so she gave her a seat something kept saying pray for the baby she said ma'am i know you're going in a prayer line a few minutes but do you mind if i pray for that baby she said absolutely not she comes through the prayer line and under discernment brother brown tells her who she is and all about her and says and your baby's already healed by the way because the holy spirit spoke to that little lady up there and told her to lay hands on your child brother said see she'd have more compassion on that baby than i would have because she was a mother god can use you [Applause] let me just say this tonight if god ever speaks to your heart to pray for someone pray pray i remember one day i was sitting at the house and my brother used to come to church therefore he passed away but he wasn't coming at the time and he was in the hospital in dallas fort worth texas really sick about to look like he was about to die anyhow and i called his son up who lived there by us and went to church and said what are you doing tomorrow he goes nothing i said let's go to dallas and pray for your daddy and saint this ain't nothing i done i just followed what he told me see when he spoke it to my heart all i knew to do was do it we walked into the hospital he was as wide as those walls and all of a sudden a big smile come across his face we laid hands on him and prayed for him god resurrected him out of the hospital and within a short time he was home but while we were there he said brother jason my wife's had a blood issue for years remember her too while you're here would you just pray for her and we prayed for her we come home and in just a couple of months he moved up started going to church with us and in a year's time his wife's blood issue left but it didn't happen overnight but just well that's not if god were done he had done it overnight god moves in his own way you can't put a time limit on god when god said she was healed she was healed where did he say that in his word by his stripes you are already healed all you've got to do is catch the inspiration and step into it when it happens you'll know it when god reveals it to you you know it nobody can take it from you it's right here it's done sunk right down in here and it ain't going nowhere i don't care what anybody says and ain't leaving when god showed you this message you didn't turn back from it you're still here i mean i remember when y'all started it been a long time ago now you're still here because that's how god moves roses but don't some of us have troubles and trials and yeah but when inspiration strikes you rise up out of it i might have been stuck down there but something struck me one sunday or one saturday and i rose up out of the pit that i was in and i got back on the way i'm not staying down i'm not staying defeated i'm a blood boat son and daughter of jesus christ and i'm going to live this way i don't care what the devil says [Music] progression do you believe god sent a prophet yeah are you ashamed of it no no not one ounce for it's brought me this message has brought me to where we are today well just said i don't understood the bible without the message no you wouldn't have you'd had a you'd have had some kind of a system mentality of it you had the bible before you came to this message but when you saw the message it changed the bible to you you know what it made it a brand new book to you you didn't read it from an old standpoint anymore you didn't read it as a book of laws of do's and don'ts you read it as a love letter to you inspiration struck and this is like i'm living it this is mine i ain't quitting he brought me safe thus far his grace will lead me on huh i'm gonna keep marching in it listen i don't care what happens keep marching in it what the devil tells you i don't care what the devil tells him he ain't listening and the thing about it is the devil can't take him until god says his time's up he ain't got enough cancer he ain't got enough diabetes he ain't got enough heart trouble he ain't got enough anything to take a blood book towel of god before your time if god ain't finished with you guess what devil i'm here to stay [Applause] and we're gonna drag your head through the mud huh we're not giving him to the devil we're not going to play down now we're too close to the shore i touched brother timothy a while ago and i said pray for me tonight he said dude skull drag that devil i have never heard that in my life but tonight we're school dragon the death cause there ain't no devil gonna praise him in my place ain't no devil gonna take over there ain't no devil going to defeat you there's nowhere that can defeat you well justin i don't feel like shouting shout anyhow sometimes i don't feel like lifting my hand lift it anyhow my arm hurts lift it give him praise for healing it hurts brother i thank god for healing it [Applause] heard brother brown say this week and you can just keep standing laying here on the cotton this man was he said sir you're shadow to death with cancer if you lay there you're going to die but if i was you i'd get up off that cot and stand up in the name of jesus christ listen church people began standing up everyone when the maniac challenged him and he fell across brother on his feet you remember pinning him to the floor brother branham said when that chief demon of the tribe was conquered now that man still going back and took that spirit back because he worshipped it but he was conquered at that moment in that meeting he had no more control over that service at that time and when he was conquered all the rest of them he was the chief all the rest of them in that congregation was conquered also and he said people began shouting standing up wheelchairs spots stretchers they threw away their walkers because they stepped into the inspiration let us do the same because there ain't no grave i'm gonna cry there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down huh if i have to go by the way of the grave guess what i'll get there before you well just and i don't want to die i don't either i'm believing we're not gonna taste dead and by inspiration that ought to be what you believe there ain't a person in here too old tonight that what couldn't see the lord jesus coming in the power of glory and that one couldn't receive a brand new body even standing here tonight they're gonna say i don't know when he's coming but i know he's coming and when he comes watch out devil but until he gets here we're still here oh we may have battle scars just play something with this we may have battle scars and we may be wounded some of us but he didn't promise a flowery bit of these but he promised this victory [Music] and i know if i could sit down tonight and listen to each one of your story mine would sing nothing to yours but the key to the whole thing is is that we all built upon the story and you didn't stay where you were at but god drove you in here and god made you a pillar in this church and god gave you victory and god gave you the courage it ain't nothing i did or you did in yourself it's what god's done for you so it don't matter what our story is we all have the same ending blessed is he that overcomes for all grant with him to drink of me to sit with me in my father's throat in my throat with him you're loving tonight let's just sing this song to him let's close this evening oh bright shine he's [Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise god
