you today we're thankful father not only for this audience that is sitting before us but the invisible audience that is watching Lord we just ask you that you would just send your word to the appropriate places Lord you have spoken to us we have prepared ourselves now we stand ready for Duty we pray that you would just help us in our own physical body we pray that you would strengthen this audience May Lord may they even become anointed by the angel of the lord lord I ask you to touch our lives today in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen and amen let's have church you can be seated I'd like to speak to you today on the authority in the name of Jesus Christ Authority is more than power but it is your right it is given to you from a higher or higher Realm but knowing who you are and what you are as Sons and Daughters of God gives you Authority it's like a police officer and we've got serval that is sitting here you carry a badge but it's just not your physical frame that you're representing you're representing the city all the dignitaries of that City you're representing the school that you came from to be a be an officer now you may not have the power to stop a bicycle but you've got the authority to step out in the middle of the road and blow a whistle and throw your hand up buses tractor trailers has to come to a screeching heart as a Christian you may not feel so strong there's maybe times that you feel incredibly weak but because you are who you are you may not have power to hard to get yourself out of bed but because you are a son and daughter of God regardless of how you feel you can take the word of God and raise your hand before the before the enemy and said that's far enough and then across your lips you're Supernatural you begin to speak the supernatural word of God the Bible is God's word to you and it's given to you he couldn't have given you a greater thing when he gave you his word and there's promises in it all through the scriptures and as a son and daughter of God you have a position with him but you must exercise your Authority amen let me just read you a prayer Lord Jesus you are the name above every name your name is like a fortified Tower in which I can find Safety and Security when I'm troubled I can find peace in your name when I am weak I can find strength in your name when I am overwhelmed I can find rest in your name I'm going to get to your house in a minute when I am surrounded by the pressures on every side I can find stability in your name you're my ever-present help in the time of trouble when it seems like my world is crumbling around me and I'm thrown against the storms of my life take away my fear when I'm weak You Are My Strength when I am vulnerable you are my refuge when I cry for help you will answer me you are the prince of peace and you breathed on your disciples and you gave them peace God told Joseph Joshua said it every place that the soul of your foot Treads upon I have given it to you so footsteps mean possessions brother Brown says now now we're more than conquerors we just walk right into it as our inheritance more than conquerors that's quite a statement isn't it now we're dealing with a defeated enemy sickness is defeated death is defeated hell is defeated everything is defeated I wish I was twice the size that I am right now while I feel good we are disputing with a conquered enemy Give the Lord a good hand right there the hour of charge is at hand soldier with armors with armors gleaming and color Streaming Faith and doubt is setting your yourself in a ray in this Tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers scan to your post of Duty our captain the more the Morning Star leads us he never goes back he don't know the word retreat so we don't have to retreat remember this and I'll just share a couple of thoughts with you he slipped the wedding band on you before the foundation of the world Hallelujah I want to remind you you are a son and daughter of God I don't care how the devil whips you beats you frails on you you're a son and daughter of God God built you to be an overcomer and he chose this age for you to live in so you will win I'm not concerned about what's in the pages of your life in the dash you will win you came from God you're going back to God I want you to think about this we are filled with the Holy Ghost that's God's seal on our life that he's got confidence in God cleaned us out he washed us out he filled us with his life then we become a reflection of him we become a reflection of him now think about this the rapture can't happen without you oh brother I am afraid I'm going to miss it it can't happen without you if you're part of him and you're sealed with the Holy Ghost you're sealed to the day of redemption Satan can't get to you or he may bother your flesh and he may get get in your spirit times but he can't get to that Gene seed of God [Applause] so when God looks at you he sees part of himself there he's not leaving it here for the tribulation period are you with me now when Jesus healed people he just didn't do it just just to show his power he did it to fulfill the word of God that's what our ambition and our purpose is to fulfill God's will the scripture says come out of her my people and be not a partaker of her place and God draws you from many different directions of Life maybe you didn't realize how it was his drawing power maybe you think I'm sitting here by an accident I'm sitting here by by some different reason I don't even know why I'm here God draws you here I want you to always realist realize this God will never lose one oh think about how great how great God looks at you God will never lose one that means more than life itself you can grab a halt of it you know a lot of times we displease ourselves we displease our spouse we displease our children but we never want to displease God [Music] last weekend when I left the pulpit it just seemed like the enemy jumped on me yeah even me he jumped on me and he's just as I had preached to you about our garment change how that we change garments from from the world to become a Christian filled with the Holy Ghost one day we will step into a new body when we die no matter what age that it is we step into a brand new body a body that Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you I stepped out of the pulpit and immediately the enemy began to bombard my mind it bombard my spirit I went home and he continued to bombard me and I just I felt Melancholy I felt I felt kind of nervous in my spirit and they just kept going through and you know sometimes ministers long suffering is you preach it and then you long suffer and so the enemy is just pounding on me and beating on me and so I even went to bed and I prayed about it went to bed and through the night I began to I began to have have uh uh nightmares and as the nightmares persisted I got up and I was just when I got up the next morning you know I was just you know I was just kind of feeling all of that Gloom and all those dark clouds and and I went and got coffee and I'm not great big coffee drinker now but I went and got coffee and I I got my cup and I was up early in the morning sister Connie hadn't moved yet and I I was just up I was trying to be quiet you know the older you get the less hearing that you have but you still shake the house and so and so anyway I was just shake I was coming back through the living room going to the office and the spirit of the Lord spoke to me and he began to speak to me and he said it's time now to go on the offensive [Applause] so when the enemy beats on you and frails on you he really don't know what he's doing it's kind of like poking a bear poking a tiger poking a Son of God or a daughter of God he can pick on you for a little while and then you turn your attention on him and when you turn your attention on him every devil in Hell's got trouble because of you who you are you have the power to bind and to loose the power to speak God's word and shake the kings of hell prayer is like an atomic bomb to destroy the cluster bomb to destroy the enemy that comes against you we realize that as a wife of almighty God you have checked book Authority husbands and wives that are sitting here when you said I do the day that you said I do if you did it right his and hers and his and it becomes ours but let me just say this to you everything that Jesus owns is yours all of Heaven is yours don't look at your temporary situation feel sorry for yourself God owns it all so that means he owns all the gold he owns all the colonians on the all he owns the cattle on a thousand hills so if God owns it and you're his wife you learn it too Hallelujah now Satan so many times he'll tell you you're you know you're you know nobody loves you nobody cares for you you're not at you're you're you're a hypocrite you're you're backslidden you know God don't care for you all of those different kind of things remember he's a liar remember he's a liar remember that God has already called you and when he called you he justified you and then he fills you with the Holy Spirit sure it was a process that you went through but once God starts a work he don't fit he don't quit on his job he's not the kind of contractor that gets overwhelmed and all of a sudden he decides it's just too big of a job he he knew where you was drunk prostitute dope addict God knows exactly where you are he's got a blood for that he's got a blood for that are you with me now Jesus would say that it might be fulfilled that it might be fulfilled and he went about to fulfill the word of God we are here that it might be fulfilled you were actually fulfilling scripture sitting where you're at now I want you to think about it if the enemy could have stopped you from coming to church today I don't know if you went through anything this week but if he could have stopped you he Wars in your mind he Wars in your attitudes he Wars are you with me am I am I preaching to the right Church he Wars with you sister Megan I just pre I just talked to you yesterday and you you lost a family member you were crushed but you've got Jesus and he hears any answers and he watches over let me just say the world has calamities and so will we the world has problems but so will we but we heard an incredible youth group said but I got Jesus I got something that the world ain't got I got Jesus and the greatest thing he's got me [Applause] you are here for a purpose you are here to destroy the works of the devil because you have a part of what that to do Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil then your purpose as his offspring his sons and daughters we had the same ambition I'm going to destroy the works of the devil can you repeat that with me I'm going to destroy the works of the devil you may be a little lady here that's 110 pounds soaking wet I'm not going any higher than that I'm smarter than that but let me just say this to you you may not have the power to pick up a a car but you got the power to stop the enemy when the enemy comes after your children there was a statement made in the world that we're coming after your children well you don't know what you're up against you can't have our children I don't care how many letters you got in front of your movement lgbb I don't care we got a g l d [Music] let me just read you some quotes Satan you are defeated we come against thee tonight in the name of the of the Lord Jesus by the authority of the Holy Ghost and the power of the resurrected Lord Jesus this group of Believers comes in the presence of the almighty come out Satan I journey in the name of Jesus leave every person in divine presence you're defeated leave them in Jesus name amen stand on your feet and give God praise for his great glorious power number two then in Jesus Christ named Satan you who have done the evil you're not afraid of me I know that but I come as a representative name I come to represent him who stripped you of every Authority that you had at Calvary Jesus Christ the son of God he spoiled you and you have no power you're a bluff and we're calling your hand in the name of Jesus Christ come out of the woman I jury thee by God that you leave him one of the most powerful words that you will ever use as a Christian when you identify Satan has walked into your space leave can you say that with me leave Hallelujah you got a space you know a lot of people like to get right up in your space to talk to you I can hear and Satan likes to get in your spirits leave [Music] then in the Jesus Christ's name Satan you who have done the evil you're not afraid of me did I just read that but I come as an interrepresentative name I come into represent him who stripped you of every Authority that you had at Calvary Jesus Christ the son of God he spoiled you you have no power you're a bluff we'll call in your hand in the name of Jesus Christ come out of the woman I adjure Thee by the Living God that you leave her it's good the second time sometimes I think we need to read it 10 times our life is hitting God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and raised up with him sitting with Heavenly places watching him think of it no power but Authority we don't have power we have authority Christ has the power he is the power but we have authority we don't have any power but we have authority it don't take power someone said you got any power no but I got Authority you take a little policeman standing out there he wears a uniform his hat is too big for him sets down over his ears he hasn't got power to stop nothing but let him walk out there and a car is coming down the street 300 horsepower engine let him raise up his hand watch the break slide he hasn't got power but he's got Authority and when a man and woman is Anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he might not be able to read his name in boxcar letters with education but he's got Authority with God because he is a son of God um John chapter 10 and verse 17 great quote book therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I might take it up again notice what he's saying no man taketh it from me but I lay it down on myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again this commandment I received of my father where did he get that kind of a word he read it in the scripture and the scripture gave him power and authority to do it when you read it in the scripture Hallelujah don't you love him Joshua chapter 1 and verse 1. now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua with the son of none Moses's Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan you heard this last Saturday night and all the people into the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given to you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and for and this this Lebanon even to the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the high Tates under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of my life notice this next words as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee read the next words be strong and of a good courage brother Brown Andrew quoted this last night he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church in what she is and what she stands for she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army not because it's greater than what Jesus did but it's more people doing the same works but I can't get the phone call to the preacher you got the same God I may not be there in your hour of Crisis but let me just say this you he is always with you Hallelujah now sons and daughters who has the most power before God an angel a servant is that right they're his servants what are you his son and daughter who has the most power in heaven then a sinner that's been saved by the grace or an archangel that stands by his right side The Sinner that's been saved by grace has more Authority in heaven than an archangel that has stood by his side without sin because you're his son now let me just say this to you we we have seen the angel of the Lord in this building it does that's much good when we see the presence of the god here we've seen the pillar of fire we've seen lights we've seen we've seen the Angels stand in physical form amongst us and if every one of us could see the pillar of fire all we could dance we could dance but let me just say people that are setting in this piece reach over touch your neighbor said now he's going to talk about you now he's going to talk about me if you could see the angel of God standing right here it would do you good but if you can realize who you are [Music] you have more Authority than that angel that's standing right there in Luke chapter 11 and verse 9. and I say unto you ask and it shall be given to you speak and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you it does not say text the whole world and pray send a Facebook notice everybody pray you pray before sending that text you pray sure I want the world to know but you pray you have authority with God you have a position with God you pray my world is falling apart brother Ron my my whole world's falling apart have you prayed about it have you saw God about it have you got desperate before God about it you've got power you've got unlimited resources you got it and Jesus said a lot of unanswered prayers is because they was never prayed say it with me a lot of unanswered prayers is because they were never prayed you ought to put that on your refrigerator a lot of unanswered prayers is because they were never prayed God reads my mind sure it does but it's kind of like a boy and girl in this building I'm not talking about anybody here like a boy and girl in this building I like her I wonder if she likes me I like her I like him well let me just say for the most people in this building they're not mind readers [Music] I have an interest you do it's in your Jeep young man called me one time and he said brother Ron he said Bible says touch not handle not that's right that's right and he said I got a girl in my church not here but anyway he said I got a girl in my church he said I've been loving her for a long time I said have you told her well no why are you calling me [Music] I'm married you're not my gender tell her she's no mind reader he wrote me back it worked of course it works [Applause] I may have gray in my head but I still know how love works I tell her how beautiful she is every day I tell her how much I love her every day sure I think it but it's got to come out of that mouth well brother Rona I tell God in my mind how much I tell him out of your mouth I don't care men if you've only got 1500 words spend some of those hundreds of words to God you're the leader of your home you're the leader of your wife you're the leader of your children it will create an atmosphere around you as a man why Christ speak he spoke and the blind Saul the lame walk the deaf heard the demon screamed I'll come out that the dead was raised up he didn't have to pray through he was the anointed Messiah he was that Messiah he knew he was he knew his position he knowed what he was sent to do he knowed that the father had identified him to be the Messiah to be a believer the believer and when he met that believer with faith he just spoke the word and devil scattered speak don't cry speak he knew his god-given rights many times we don't he knew what he was many times we don't Moses forgot Sanson understood others understood Joshua understood Moses forgot God had to call his attention to it why are you crying to me I sent you to do the job speak and go forth that's your purpose that's your objective I told you you'd come to this mountain take them children and lead them on just speak I don't care what's in your way move it out I give you authority to do it you spoke flies and fleas and creation and things like that now what are you hollering to me about why are you coming to me hollering these things just speak and watch it move but notice he had to do something sometimes you got to do something and you got Authority in the name of Jesus Christ but you got to exercise it hear Jesus and everything that he he said he just spoke the word and it was so God properly had a Vindicated him to be his son this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased watch him I like this now how bravely how majestically he stood before his critics destroy this Temple and I pray the father and see what he does about it destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up again in three days not I hope to I'm going to try to I will do it the scripture said so the same scripture that said he would raise up his body gives us Authority and power in the name of Jesus Christ to cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues and if they take up serpents or drink any deadly thing it won't harm them lay hands on the sick and they shall recover not that we have the power I can't heal you Jesus has already healed you but he instructed me to put my Earthly hands on the sick person and the scripture said they shall recover we just expect God to do what he said he would do preach with me now remember they had to work and the Word was made flesh and the word told them I'd give you power I give you power they had power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word he had faith and what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself he relied upon what he was he relied on knowing that he was the work he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word they was in him that give him Faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scripture had said he was this and hear exactly the scripture tied in proved that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was if you can realize who you are and what the scripture says about you [Music] tomorrow I will have extensive scans tomorrow afternoon two o'clock don't call me before two don't call me till five because I'm not a doctor

my condition he said the sickest person that we will ever take care of setting on this bed but he don't look like it does he and he just stands around he says he don't look like he's sick does he he doesn't look like he's got cancer does it it's his faith it's his face we've been three years in the process I take just as much chemos today as I ever have taken does it make me sick sure it makes me

enjoy it here yes it's awesome just the breath is so peaceful he said if it hadn't been for your stink and diet that you had me on we'd have been here five years ago [Music] I want to read you my report tomorrow afternoon it's been my report since I was a little child he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we here to as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Isaiah 53 and verse 5 if you'll put it right there for us before we go on I want to give you I report read it with me but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes who do you worship the disease of God who is more powerful the disease of God who wins in the end the disease or God [Applause] Mark chapter 16 Jesus's final words some of them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned that's pretty clear isn't it brother on I don't believe well there's a scripture for you ain't my fault there's a scripture for you and these signs shall follow them that are you a believer are you a believer then watch God in you do the work [Music] you can't do it but he does absolutely these signs shall follow them that believe over Blood Run it's just for preachers really in my in them in my name notice the authority they shall cast out devils you think well that's just in church how many ever feels the enemy come in your room and try to start talking to you don't give him a bouquet of flowers don't start talking his language just tell him leave and they shall speak with new tongues Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5. behold I sin you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord it's going to be great for believers it's going to be dreadful for unbelievers and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one place and in one Accord are you with me I'll give you a homework assignment go home this week and listen to Wednesday night's service of Aaron Oglesby and brother Tim Pruitts that means listen to that it'll shake the kingdom of hell and then when they cut it off just hang on just for a little bit they're going to cut it right back on and you're going to PC people just start shouting under the blessings of God when they realize what he said about them and some of the let me just give you some of the thoughts that he said getting in one Accord means you got to get past yourself we come to church to get into church and to start worshiping God and sometimes you've got to get past yourself you got to break the barrier of your feelings he made this statement he said what we ought to do in the summertime is go out into this open field and have church so we'll be thankful for our condition he said we come I'm gonna quote him for a little bit he said we come to church and we look at everybody else around us and what they wore and what they dressed they didn't sing my favorite songs they played their music too loud the sound is too loud it's it's a dead spot here and it's a dead spot over there and it's too loud over here and it's too hot it's too cold the fans blowing on me instead of coming to church sometimes we gotta get past ourselves well I'm too tired if you can break through into the spirit you'll get a refreshing well that person they shout you know maybe they just they shout every service well maybe you need what they got and instead of being critical then why don't you break through at home when you come to church you'll be ready to worship the law well brother Ron I'm afraid people will think I'm a fanatic you didn't mind that it's the Baltimore Orioles game you didn't mind it it's a football the baseball you didn't mind it there they're all lost they're all lost and if I don't care if they lose every game it don't mean nothing to my sleep at night but we come to church to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I am not ashamed but brother Ron you know we've matured and we've got past that know what you've got a spiritual arthritis [Applause] if you'd have been here it used to be I used to do this night what about now don't give me your excuses of your 50 years ago what about now [Applause] sit here like a cactus and all your leaves are all pulled up it's because you need some rain in your life reign of the Holy Ghost to come down to your life to give you authority to worship God [Applause] yeah my favorite president said it's not the critic that counts the critic has not done anything he don't have blood on his sword he don't have victories in his pocket but the critic can set and do nothing but just squawk and squawk and squawk let me just say don't miss the Rapture because of your squawking wow you're alive while you've got the opportunity worship god with everything that is within you I am not afraid of what somebody else says I am not ashamed of my king brother Ron I'm gonna dance on streets ago I doubt that you can't move out of your shoes right now brother on I'm gonna scream all over heaven let me just hear you right down here say Amen once in a while I think a Revival took place in your life if you can get an amen from your belly through your lips [Applause] my mother weighed 268 pounds she was five foot tall she was a rolling bowling ball on two feet my mother's knees were in horrible condition they were stiff her legs were stiff she slept in a lazy boy from her 50s but when it comes time to worship God that 268 pound woman shook the house don't give me your excuses [Applause] [Music] and if I can stand to you here with stage four cancer in my brain and in my lungs and in my body I can't take any of your excuses I don't lay out at church sure there's times I feel bad sure there's times that come on but I have taken your book of excuses I throwed it in the trash as long as I'm alive I'm gonna praise the Lord as long as I'm alive I'm gonna torment the kingdom of hell as long as I'm alive [Applause] Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me Jesus is not just one of the ways he is the way John chapter 3 and verse 16. for God so led the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and God sent not a son into the world to condemn the world but through him might be saved he that believeth on on him is not condemned and but he that believeth not is condemned already you don't have to wait to the Judgment bar you're condemned already you're either going in one direction or the other Jesus said these words they may be difficult ye are from beneath and I am from above year of this world but I am not of this world some of your critics if you can just say this in your heart it'll get you in trouble if you let it go across your lips and remember he that's giving you the biggest biggest criticism you're from beneath always consider the source Year from beneath I'm from above now this is a scripture this is more than just Jesus's scripture this is our destiny I came from God I'm going back to God I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins if you believe not that I am he Acts chapter 4 and verse 12. neither is there salvation in any other there is none other name unto Heaven given to the men whereby that you must be saved that's our Authority you'll turn with me Psalms chapter 91 and verse 1. I want you to read it with me I'll read the first verse you read the second verse he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide unto the shadow of the Almighty surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noise and pestilence thank you Thou shalt not be afraid by the terror by night nor the arrow that flyeth by day A thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come thy thee because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high the habitation do you believe that read it again now I want you to read it loud enough that the devil can hear it on Monday when you have a problem reading that scripture on Tuesday when you have a problem reading that scripture those are not your words even David's words that's God's words next verse for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways oh Hallelujah Isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases their strength even then use that's faint and be weary and the young man that shall elderly fail but they that weighed upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings that's an ego they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and nothing laughs let me just talk to you for a second I'm done so the tumors where they lay at actually cause nightmares the chemo that I take actually calls nightmare the other drugs that I take actually cause nightmares but in spite of that there's moments to where I have incredible dreams so I was walking

sudden I was a buzzer and you know what when I woke up I could feel the Holy Ghost all over the room because God is my strength and he told me I'm a war eagle he told me I'm a war eagle so I want to finish today with Satan have you forgot who you're dealing with now I want you to say it I want you to say it to your neighbor Satan have you forgot who you're dealing with sister Connie you're not

thousands of tapes that that we no longer use I know that there's a few that still use our our tape recordings there and if you would like to still access those if you could just come to brother Alden or one of the deacons but we have more than thousands of them upstairs we don't use them anymore because we have it on SD cards we have it on our phones and so if anybody would like those if you could just come and address us and we'll we'll make make do to make sure that you get those if not we're going to reach out to others so we just want to make that available to you if you would like that because we're trying to I don't know if you know this or not but the church is growing and so we're trying to make arrangements for where we can place people at and so we we need to make some things happen so but if you would like those just please come and see one of us and we'll make sure that that is available we're not going to throw them away but we we've got to put them in storage somewhere or do something because uh I believe that you need seats so and uh so if you would like those just come to us mention that to one of the brothers we'll make sure that it happens and so we just thank the Lord that it used to take us it we had to ship cargo containers full of message tapes across season but now we can send the same amount of those tapes in a little bitty package or a little bitty box and an SD card form send them overseas and the shipping cost is very minimal compared to what it used to be so we we thank the Lord for the advancement of it and and so we look at how the progress of how that it all has transpired throughout the years of the mess message of reel to reel to tapes and where we are now today it's on our phones and you know we've got no excuse for listening to the message and putting it before us and so we thank the Lord for those things but you not only see that you see the advancement of young people as soon as they come in and get birthed under the kingdom of God they're they're so knowledgeable of the message and this is just an advancement of the age and this is the age of the quick work and we're seeing the Lord do what he said that he would do right here and so we just we love this message with all of our heart and so those things are available if you don't know how to access the message come see one of us if you if you can't find it on your phone or you don't have access to it come see us we'll help you out in some way everybody most people's got a smartphone nowadays and if you don't we find out some other way to get it to you that but God has given us the accessibility to be able to hear the prophet's voice in this hour and to see that we have a voice behind the voice that is declaring that a bride is here so we we're just a very blessed people today and so we just we just want to ask you that if you would like those things just come see us also the waterfall downstairs we want you to enjoy it take pictures in front of it but
