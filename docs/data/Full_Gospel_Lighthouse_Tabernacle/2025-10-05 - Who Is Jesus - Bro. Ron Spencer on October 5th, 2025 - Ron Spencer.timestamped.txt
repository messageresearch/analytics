[4:49] ask brother William if he would just
[4:51] come lead us to the throne of grace this
[4:53] morning.
[4:56] Amen. Let's bow our heads in our hearts.
[4:59] Dear gracious, kind heavenly father,
[5:00] Lord, we thank you for this privilege,
[5:02] Lord, to come together, Lord, to be
[5:04] united, oh God, around your unchanging
[5:06] word and around your spirit, Lord.
[5:08] Truly, what a mighty God that you are,
[5:11] Lord. You've never lost a battle. You
[5:12] are the mighty conqueror, Lord. We
[5:15] confess, oh God, that all power in
[5:16] heavens and earth belongs unto you. And
[5:19] we look unto you, the author and the
[5:21] finisher of our faith this morning.
[5:23] Lord, we thank you for the breath you've
[5:24] given us in our lungs, Lord, and the
[5:25] energy, Lord, that you've given us to
[5:27] come to the house of God. And Lord, the
[5:29] hunger in our hearts, oh God, to come
[5:31] and to hear from you, Lord. We just lift
[5:33] up and glorify your name. And we just
[5:35] want to tell you how much we love you,
[5:36] Lord, and how thankful we are to you,
[5:38] Lord, for your goodness and grace and
[5:40] mercy, Lord, that follows us all the
[5:42] days of our lives. Lord, we thank you,
[5:45] Father, Lord, for the ways that you
[5:46] protect us that we're not even aware of.
[5:48] And how you go ahead of us even and you
[5:50] thwart the enemy's attacks and his traps
[5:52] and Lord, how we thank you, Lord, that

[6:02] name and we glorify you. Lord, we just
[6:04] want to sing praises to you, Lord, and
[6:05] make you feel so welcome in this place,
[6:08] Lord. We just want to empty ourselves
[6:09] out, Lord, as we just sing songs of
[6:12] worship and praise to you. we begin to
[6:14] lift up our hands. Lord, may you help us
[6:16] just empty ourselves out of ourselves
[6:18] and all the cares and concerns of life
[6:20] that you can come and through your word
[6:22] and through your spirit you can fill us.
[6:24] Lord, you heard each and every request
[6:26] Lord that was made mention Lord. You
[6:28] know every single detail Lord and you
[6:30] are Lord the author again and the
[6:32] finisher of our faith. Lord we look at
[6:34] the things that we don't see with eyes
[6:36] of faith. Many times, Lord, we're
[6:38] challenged to look past circumstances
[6:40] and events that just seem so impossible
[6:43] and and side effects and symptoms. But
[6:45] Lord, we choose your word. We look at
[6:47] your word with eyes of faith. And we
[6:50] proclaim healing upon every situation
[6:52] and every request that was that was read
[6:54] and every hand that was raised. And we
[6:56] proclaim deliverance. We proclaim a
[6:58] perfect health. We proclaim a perfect
[7:00] soundness of mind. We love you now. We
[7:03] just ask your blessings over this
[7:04] service. We commit, Brother Ron, to you,
[7:06] Lord. We just pray that you strengthen
[7:08] him in a special way. Bless him, Father,
[7:10] oh God, with divine health. You've been
[7:12] so good to him along the way. We just
[7:14] pray that you continue to to bless him
[7:16] and strengthen him and we know you will.
[7:18] Bless the word that you've given them,
[7:19] Lord, to our hearts. May you receive all
[7:20] the praise, honor, and glory. Bless
[7:22] every person in attendance and those
[7:24] that will stream. Bless the communion
[7:26] service, Lord. And as we take it, oh
[7:27] God, with sincerity,
[7:29] may it mean something special to us,
[7:31] Lord. Maybe something that has never
[7:33] meant to us before. May you just help us
[7:34] to take it with humility and sincerity.
[7:36] We just love you. We thank you for your
[7:38] blood and your broken body in Jesus
[7:40] Christ's name. Amen.

[13:10] home. The one who thinks they're too far
[13:13] gone. I'm throwing out another prayer of
[13:18] faith.

[31:31] with us today. Amen. Brother Ron Vest
[31:34] and your family. You know your
[31:36] daughter-in-law is going to out hunt
[31:37] you.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; She's already killed a monster this
[31:42] week. And so, Amen. So, I I'll be honest
[31:46] with you. When I saw the picture and you
[31:48] beside it, I just went ahead and shouted
[31:50] for you. So, it's hunting season and you
[31:54] know, we say there's always a divorce in
[31:56] hunting season, but looked like she beat
[31:58] you to the punch. And so,
[32:00] Amen.
[32:02] Isn't it good? It's wonderful, isn't it?
[32:05] Thank you, Lord.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So glad to have Sister Kylie with
[32:08] us and she's been going through some
[32:10] things, but God's greater.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; He's greater. Nathan, we're glad to have
[32:15] you back with us and congratulations on
[32:18] on uh passing all of the things that
[32:20] you've had to pass. And welcome to the
[32:22] railroad.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Marcus, good to see you
[32:26] today. Amen. And each and every one of
[32:28] you, why don't you turn to your
[32:30] neighbor, good to see you.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[32:44] If you will turn with me to Matthew
[32:46] chapter 21 and verse 9.
[32:57] Amen.
[33:02] Matthew 21 and verse 9. I want to speak
[33:06] to you today on who is Jesus.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; He's coming back as king.
[33:16] &gt;&gt; And we're going to be here with him as
[33:18] queen. And I think that there's ever
[33:20] been a day to where that this world
[33:23] needs Jesus.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; It needs it now.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; It absolutely needs it now.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; And I I'll just have to say this to you.
[33:31] America doesn't want the Jesus that we
[33:33] serve.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; They don't want him.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; The more that we go in life and the more
[33:41] news that we see, the more insane
[33:44] &gt;&gt; that it is. That's right.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Israel needs Jesus.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; This whole world needs Jesus.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad to serve him. I'm glad to
[33:55] know that I know him today.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Matthew chap 21 and verse 9. And the
[34:02] multitudes that went before and that
[34:06] followed
[34:08] cried, saying,
[34:10] Hosana to the son of David. Blessed is
[34:13] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
[34:16] Hosana in the highest.
[34:19] And when he was come to Jerusalem, all
[34:21] the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
[34:26] And the multitude said, "This is Jesus,
[34:30] the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." If
[34:34] you will turn with me to Matthew 16 and
[34:36] verse 13. All of these are familiar
[34:39] text.
[34:42] Matthew 16 and verse 13. And when Jesus
[34:45] came up to the coast of Cesaria
[34:47] Philippi,
[34:49] he asked his disciples, saying, this is
[34:52] a powerful statement, whom do men say
[34:55] that I the son of man am?
[34:58] And they said, Some say that thou art
[35:01] John the Baptist, and some Elias, and
[35:03] others Jeremas, or one of the prophets.
[35:07] And he said unto them, "But whom say ye
[35:09] that I am?" And Simon Peter answered and
[35:13] said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of
[35:15] the living God?" And Jesus answered and
[35:18] said unto him, "Blessed art thou Simon
[35:22] Barjonah, for flesh and blood, hath not
[35:24] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[35:27] which is in heaven." It takes a
[35:29] revelation to know who Jesus is. And I
[35:32] say also unto thee, that thou art Peter,
[35:34] and upon this rock, I will build my
[35:38] church, and on the gate, and the gates
[35:39] of hell shall not prevail against it.
[35:42] And I will give unto thee the keys of
[35:44] the kingdom, and whatsoever thou shalt
[35:47] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
[35:49] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[35:51] shall be loosed in heaven." And then
[35:54] charged he the disciples that they
[35:57] should tell no man that he was Jesus
[36:02] the Christ.
[36:04] Amen. Let's pray. Father,
[36:08] we love you today.
[36:10] We love you with all of our hearts
[36:14] and we in our humanity, we ask you to
[36:16] forgive us of our sins and our mistakes
[36:19] and our failures. We come short every
[36:22] day of our lives.
[36:25] Thoughts, words, deeds.
[36:29] We would ask you today that you would
[36:31] come and fill our hearts with your
[36:33] presence.
[36:34] Lord, there's just none like you. You
[36:37] have never ever disappointed me in life.
[36:42] Now, I ask you to come and anoint the
[36:44] speaker
[36:45] &gt;&gt; and anoint the hearer.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; All of us have needs here today.
[36:49] All of us desire more of you.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; We would like a revival to be set on
[36:54] fire in our hearts.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you're the one that can do
[36:58] that today. No man can do that.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; Lord, I ask you that you would ignite
[37:03] these words that we have studied. And we
[37:06] just ask you that you would just let
[37:08] them live, dear God. Live in our hearts
[37:11] and live in our lives. needs of our
[37:14] flesh, needs in our spirit, needs in the
[37:17] jobs, needs in the finances. You're a
[37:20] God that hears and understands
[37:24] when nobody else can do what you can do.
[37:27] You can come on the scene and touch us
[37:29] today in Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[37:33] Amen. And amen. You may be seated.
[37:38] Amen. God bless you.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:42] Prophet said, he said, "God is either
[37:44] God or he's not God." Quite a statement,
[37:48] isn't it? Jesus either the son of God or
[37:51] he is an impostor.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; He is Christ the son of God. He's not
[37:58] dead, but he's alive. And he lives
[38:02] forever more.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[38:07] forever. Come on, buddy.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; Give the Lord a good hand right there.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're glad to have Sister Kimberly
[38:21] Cabb Breeze's father
[38:24] with us today. Give him a great big
[38:26] hand.
[38:32] Amen. God bless you. Good to have you
[38:35] here. Amen. God bless you. You don't
[38:39] look old enough to have her as a
[38:40] daughter.
[38:50] Amen. I got my first amen out of him.
[38:53] So,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. We're on a good track.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and8 is the theme of the
[39:00] message. Jesus Christ
[39:04] the same yesterday
[39:06] and today and forever.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; That means that his power never
[39:12] diminishes.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; He can save the worst sinner in the
[39:16] whole world
[39:17] &gt;&gt; and it does not diminish his grace or
[39:20] his mercy.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; He can heal the greatest cancer patient
[39:26] in the world.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; It does not diminish his healing power.
[39:31] any whatsoever.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You can be in the
[39:38] greatest financial bind in the entire
[39:40] world and God can rescue you and it does
[39:44] not diminish the bank account of heaven
[39:47] whatsoever.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:52] He said, "I am the first
[39:56] &gt;&gt; and I am the last
[39:58] and besides me there is no God."
[40:03] &gt;&gt; In Revelations 1 and verse 8, I am alpha
[40:07] and omega,
[40:09] the beginning and the ending.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; Sayaith the Lord, which is, which was,
[40:16] and which is to come, the Almighty.
[40:19] Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Let's read that verse together. I like
[40:22] for the word to come right off of your
[40:24] lips. I am alpha and omega, the
[40:28] beginning and the ending, saith the
[40:30] Lord, which is, which was, and which is
[40:34] to come,
[40:35] &gt;&gt; the Almighty.
[40:45] The prophet said, "Give me a church
[40:47] that's so completely anointed with God
[40:50] till every action and every move is thus
[40:53] saith the Lord. Walk in the shina of
[40:56] glory and I'll show you a Messiah
[40:59] anointed one of God standing on the
[41:02] earth."
[41:03] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand and this is
[41:05] just this is just common knowledge. God
[41:07] fills all time, space, and eternity.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; He is omnisient. He is omnipotent. He is
[41:15] omnipresent.
[41:17] He is infinite.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; He is here now and he hears every prayer
[41:26] that you pray.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; There will be times that you feel like
[41:31] the power of God is filling the room.
[41:33] There will be times to where you feel
[41:35] like your prayer goes out of your lips
[41:38] and hits the floor. Right.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; But he is with you.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; No matter how you feel,
[41:47] &gt;&gt; cuz it's not based on your feelings.
[41:49] It's not based on your emotions. It's
[41:52] not based on your energies.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; It is based on the word of God.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll never leave you and
[42:01] I'll never forsake you.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; I'll be with you."
[42:06] &gt;&gt; I like that with you. Don't you? Amen.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; 1949, brother Bram says this. He said
[42:13] the deity of him. Who is he?
[42:17] Some of them makes him a little baby
[42:18] back yonder.
[42:21] He is the one that stood
[42:24] on the invisible
[42:26] platform and rad out his hands and
[42:29] spoke, "Let there be."
[42:36] &gt;&gt; And there was light.
[42:41] That was Jesus Christ.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; For he was the word, the world and the
[42:48] world was made by him and the world
[42:51] recognized him not.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; He is the deity of God. Look what he did
[42:57] back there. You talk about a miraculous
[42:59] back there. Talk about a shouting.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; When he performed the miraculous things
[43:04] to make that which are which are now out
[43:08] of the things which were not, he spoke
[43:11] it and it was so.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; And that same power, that same Christ,
[43:18] let the fundamentalists, let them people
[43:20] who deny the power of God say it's
[43:23] wrong. But the same power that spoke the
[43:26] world into existence is in those people
[43:29] that's got the Holy Ghost.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; That's right, men and women. It's time
[43:35] that we found out who we are.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to hide you back and
[43:41] tell you that you're some little old
[43:43] coward down something. You're not.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; You are sons and daughters of God.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; The deity is not in heaven. It's inside
[43:51] of you. I know you think I'm crazy, but
[43:54] let me just tell you something, brother.
[43:56] When you realize that almighty God lives
[43:59] in you,
[44:01] &gt;&gt; immortal life, my life I give you, Zoe,
[44:07] God's own life, the life of God, lives
[44:11] in a human being.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; He stood back there. He's the creator of
[44:16] all things. He made frogs,
[44:20] bees,
[44:22] ducks, chickens.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; Everything that was ever made, he made
[44:28] it.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Who was he? Christ, the deity. He
[44:33] brought down plagues and everything in
[44:35] the days of Egypt. He stopped the mouths
[44:37] of lions. He quenched the violence of
[44:40] fire. They escaped the edge of the
[44:42] sword. They raised the dead from the
[44:44] grave. Who is it? Christ.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; That's my Jesus.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Philippians Philippians chapter 2 and
[44:56] verse 10. The name of Jesus. Every knee
[45:00] shall bow.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; At the name of Jesus, every knee shall
[45:05] bow of things in heaven and things on
[45:08] the earth and things under
[45:13] &gt;&gt; brother. But they won't do that today.
[45:15] They will.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; They will.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; In Acts 4 and verse 10, be it known unto
[45:24] you, unto you all, and to all the people
[45:27] of Israel, that by the name of Jesus
[45:30] Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified,
[45:33] whom God raised from the dead, even by
[45:36] him doth this man stand here before you
[45:39] whole. This is the stone which was set
[45:42] at the not of you the the builders which
[45:45] has become the head of the corner.
[45:48] Neither is there salvation in any other.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; For there is none other name.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; There's none other name unto heaven
[45:58] given unto men whereby that we must be
[46:02] saved.
[46:09] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse1 14. For
[46:12] this cause I bow my knees unto the
[46:15] father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom
[46:18] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[46:22] named.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Does that mean anything to me brother?
[46:27] You're Mrs. Jesus Christ
[46:29] &gt;&gt; and everything he owns you own.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; All the power that he has you have.
[46:36] Come on.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; So you can say to your trouble, leave.
[46:52] He was a man when he was weeping.
[46:55] But when he stood and straightened his
[46:57] little frame up and said, "Lazarus,
[47:00] &gt;&gt; come forth."
[47:03] &gt;&gt; A man that had been dead for 4 days come
[47:05] out of a grave.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; He was more than a man.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Corruption had set in. And the master
[47:16] knew
[47:17] that he was the creator. And when he
[47:20] stood down there on the mountain, one
[47:22] night he was hungry and looked up around
[47:24] and and something to eat and couldn't
[47:27] find nothing. He was a man. He was
[47:30] hungry. But when he took five biscuits
[47:35] &gt;&gt; and two pieces of fish,
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, not just fish,
[47:41] cooked fish.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Not just bread, cooked dough.
[47:48] and he breasted it.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Listen, us Christians
[47:54] know how to eat.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me when we leave church, the
[47:59] first thing we looking for is something
[48:01] to eat.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; These people were hungry. They had been
[48:06] listening to Jesus preach for a while.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; And you know, when Jesus got to
[48:11] preaching,
[48:14] &gt;&gt; he wasn't preaching to teacup
[48:15] Christians. He was preaching to people
[48:17] for hours and they got hungry.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Ray, I can imagine as the
[48:29] disciples said, "We got to send them
[48:31] away. We don't have enough to give them.
[48:33] We can't feed them. It would cost
[48:34] thousands of dollars in this day.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; What do we have here?" And a little boy
[48:41] maybe that has skipped some school
[48:44] was about to get some physics lessons.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; And he took two pieces of fish.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; They wasn't great big fish. This little
[48:57] boy had to had to carry them.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; And there wasn't five great big old
[49:04] biscuits.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; They were they were catad biscuits.
[49:10] You know, once in a while, Sister Connie
[49:12] gets in a mood, and I can see her over
[49:14] working, and she really don't want me to
[49:17] see it, but she's making catad biscuits.
[49:20] Let me tell you about catad biscuits.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; They begin to spread out. They go good
[49:24] with butter and jelly, but they go
[49:26] better with gravy.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; You want to make a man happy, put some
[49:33] gravy on his plate.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Put some biscuits on there. Jesus known
[49:39] how to make people happy.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; There wasn't none of those disciples
[49:46] could fathom what was about to take
[49:48] place because Jesus was more than a man.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you tonight, you can come
[49:54] here in this building today and God
[49:56] knows how to meet every one of your
[49:58] needs.
[50:07] And
[50:07] &gt;&gt; he begin to break the bread. Had to be
[50:09] some baskets around and he be to break
[50:11] the bread
[50:13] and he be to bless the fish.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Now I don't know I wasn't there but I
[50:20] want to tell you that everybody grabbed
[50:21] their portion. Hallelujah.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; And if you're feeding guys like brother
[50:27] Metas, he's grabbing some portion.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; He know how to grab two or three plates
[50:33] at the same time.
[50:36] But that little boy was getting ready to
[50:38] watch multiplication
[50:42] &gt;&gt; take place.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what a miracle. But you
[50:46] remember there was also a miracle when
[50:48] he said, "Let there be." Amen.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; And that sun that we love to see come up
[50:54] in the morning.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And when we're hunting and a big old
[50:57] buck is standing in front of us, we're
[50:59] saying, "Come up quicker."
[51:02] &gt;&gt; And that sun is always on time
[51:06] &gt;&gt; and it's rays a beam. And God spoke that
[51:10] into existence.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; When he made the sun, the moon, and the
[51:15] stars, he did it with purpose. That's
[51:17] right.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Listen. The waves on the earth of the
[51:21] sea had to have boundaries.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; So he put the moon at a certain spot
[51:30] &gt;&gt; to watch over the earth that it wouldn't
[51:32] flood.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, the moon's not just up there man
[51:37] and the moon. I want you to know God
[51:39] placed it on a purpose.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; That the gravity would just be exactly
[51:45] right. God did it all.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] When you look down at your hands, God
[51:51] made your hands for a purpose.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; In your hands, you have the ability to
[51:57] feel.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; You know what's hot and you know what's
[52:01] cold. You know what's tender. You know
[52:03] what's hard.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Your little bitty hands reached up to
[52:07] your mother
[52:09] &gt;&gt; and you trusted her.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And her hands may be scarred by washing
[52:14] dishes and taking care of the house. Her
[52:17] hands were so tender to you.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; What a mother's touch can do.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; You with your little hands reached up
[52:28] and could hold a hold of her hands. I
[52:30] want you to know we need to put our
[52:33] hands in the hands of God.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; There are times in the trials of your
[52:40] life when you can't get mama and you
[52:43] can't get daddy. Come on.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; You can reach your hands into his hands.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; He was a man
[52:59] when he tried to lay out there in a
[53:01] little old ship.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; It was tossing about like a bottle
[53:06] stopper on a mighty ocean.
[53:09] 10,000 devils swore
[53:12] &gt;&gt; that they would quit kill him.
[53:15] Swore that they would drown him. He was
[53:18] a man that was laying there in that
[53:20] ship.
[53:22] But when he was put his foot on the brow
[53:24] brow of that boat,
[53:26] &gt;&gt; and he looked up and said, "Peace,
[53:32] &gt;&gt; peace,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; be still." Come on.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; That roaring sea became glass.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; What about your storm today?
[53:47] &gt;&gt; What about your storm?
[53:52] &gt;&gt; He was a man when he stood there and
[53:54] cried for mercy upon the cross.
[54:02] But when he broke the veil of the tomb,
[54:06] he was the mighty cocker.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Listen. Without a resurrection morning,
[54:14] we're all lost.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; There would be no resurrection.
[54:19] Without a cross,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; We're all lost.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; There would be no forgiveness.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:35] Greater is he.
[54:38] He's God, the creator.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; The winds and the waves had to obey him.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Demons became paralyzed in his presence.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Nature obeyed him because he was the
[54:53] creator of every creature. All right,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to behave here.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; And when we think about that, it takes
[55:02] the bite out. Then think about it,
[55:05] understand these things. What is it? It
[55:09] isn't man. Man cannot do that,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Man is a part of creation.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; But the winds and waves had to obey the
[55:20] creator.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; It takes a creator to do that. Amen.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; For he that's in you.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; For he that's in you is greater than he
[55:33] that's in the world.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; He can cause the turmoil that's in this
[55:40] world. He that's in you is the creator
[55:45] &gt;&gt; who made the winds. Who rebuked the
[55:47] devil out of the winds. And there is
[55:49] calm. He can rebuke the devil out of
[55:53] your storm.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Men will take decades to try to figure
[56:02] out things.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Decades.
[56:08] And it takes God a second.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And I would say something smaller than
[56:14] that, but millisecond.
[56:16] It actually don't take God no time cuz
[56:19] he feels all time, space, and eternity.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; In John chapter 6 and verse 49,
[56:34] he says, "I am the bread of life."
[56:37] He said, "Your fathers did eat man in
[56:39] the wilderness and are dead."
[56:43] And he said, "This is the bread which
[56:44] cometh down from heaven that a man may
[56:47] eat thereof and not die." Now notice
[56:51] this step. This next statement is going
[56:52] to get him killed.
[56:55] I am the living bread
[56:58] &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And if any man eat of this bread, he
[57:03] shall live forever.
[57:06] and the bread which I give unto thee is
[57:09] my flesh which I give you give for the
[57:13] life of the world. And the Jews
[57:16] therefore sought among themselves saying
[57:20] how can this man
[57:23] give us his flesh to eat?
[57:26] &gt;&gt; It had to blow their mind. Oh yeah.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[57:32] verily, I say unto you, except a man,
[57:35] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[57:37] man and drink his blood," we're going to
[57:39] have communion here a little while. "Ye
[57:41] have no life in you. And whosoever eat
[57:44] of my flesh and drinkkeeth of my blood
[57:47] shall have eternal life, and I will
[57:50] raise him up at the last day."
[57:52] &gt;&gt; You talking about a promise.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; If you eat this word,
[58:01] For my flesh is meat indeed, and my
[58:04] blood is drink indeed. And he that
[58:06] eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood
[58:08] dwelleth in me, and I in him, as a
[58:10] living father hath sent me, and I live
[58:13] by the father. And so that he that
[58:16] eateth me, even he shall live by me.
[58:20] That's right.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; This is the bread which came down from
[58:23] heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana
[58:27] and are dead. And he that eateth of this
[58:30] bread shall live forever.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand God God knows
[58:38] exactly what he deposited on the inside
[58:41] of you.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he deposited on
[58:47] the inside of you. All of us have a
[58:49] different look.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; All of us have different hair. We all
[58:54] have different eye colors. We all have
[58:56] different fingerprints.
[58:58] We all are built of this human natural
[59:01] DNA.
[59:02] And God watched over your DNA.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And I've said it many times. I'll say it
[59:08] again this morning to drive a point. If
[59:11] you've ever seen a miracle, look in the
[59:13] mirror.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[59:16] God watched over your humanity.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right, brother.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Just to get you here.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And if you remember, every act there's a
[59:27] million cells that is thrown forward.
[59:30] But only one is given life.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; When you were born and given life, nine
[59:37] nine n9 died.
[59:41] [Music]
[59:43] God watched over that since Adam.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ryan, I there's
[59:51] too many things that's bigger." Let me
[59:53] just say, if God did all that to get you
[59:55] healed,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; are you with me? So many times we limit
[1:00:02] God. God watched over your human DNA all
[1:00:06] the way down here.
[1:00:09] That's right.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; The scripture said you were fearfully
[1:00:15] and wonderfully made.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to act like somebody else.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Quit trying to imitate somebody else.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Be you.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; They watched over you to get you here.
[1:00:40] $5 five by 10.
[1:00:44] He watched over you to get you here.
[1:00:46] Then he says, "I want to live in you."
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Now, it's not your flesh that he's got
[1:00:54] confidence in.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; It's not your flesh,
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; Because you even disappoint yourself.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You disappoint one another.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:08] If you're married, you know that you
[1:01:10] should have said
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Cuz stuff happens,
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; So God does not have confidence in your
[1:01:22] flesh.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; He has confidence on the seed of God
[1:01:28] that he put there before the foundation
[1:01:30] of the world.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; You see, that seed is part of himself.
[1:01:36] That's right.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; God deposited there. He's got confidence
[1:01:45] in that. Let me just give you a for
[1:01:47] instance. Watch this. When Adam and Eve
[1:01:50] was in the Garden of Eden,
[1:01:53] under the serpent's seed, she was to be
[1:01:56] destroyed.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But under the seed of Adam, because he
[1:02:00] was a part of God, God would not destroy
[1:02:03] her.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because a part of God was in Adam
[1:02:07] and then inside of her.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; You remember a lady named Ruth?
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Listen. And God watched over her through
[1:02:17] all the failings of humanity.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; But one day, there was a part of the
[1:02:23] seed of God that was planted in her
[1:02:25] womb.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; I just like to shout over this for a
[1:02:31] while. She was a part of another
[1:02:32] kingdom.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; She was a part of another gentile
[1:02:36] dispensation. But because of the seed
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; of the line of the tribe of Judah was
[1:02:43] planted in her womb,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; she became as eternal as Jesus Christ is
[1:02:49] eternal.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; What about Esther?
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; What about all the ladies of grace? What
[1:02:57] about you?
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; I got news for you. We were all nobodies
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; in this world. But when Jesus came, he
[1:03:08] made you a somebody.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I I I don't feel like
[1:03:17] nobody.
[1:03:20] Let me just give you a first instance
[1:03:21] here just for a moment.
[1:03:25] You guys work in a bank.
[1:03:29] Does the president of the bank ever come
[1:03:30] in?
[1:03:33] Occasionally,
[1:03:34] but he don't walk in and go, "I'm the
[1:03:36] president of this bank." No, he don't do
[1:03:39] that.
[1:03:40] He don't have to go in any office that
[1:03:43] he goes in and go, "I'm the president."
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; He don't have a certain attire that he
[1:03:49] wears.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; He just walks in. He goes to his office,
[1:03:54] goes to his desk, and just puts his
[1:03:57] coffee cup down. What's really important
[1:03:59] to him is he don't spill his coffee
[1:04:01] between car and desk
[1:04:05] [Applause]
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; cuz he knows who he is.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; He's got the job.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; He's not worried. Somebody else is going
[1:04:13] to take the job from him. Let me just
[1:04:15] say this. You, you are sons and
[1:04:17] daughters of God.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You don't have to spend your whole day
[1:04:22] going, I'm a son of God. I'm a son of
[1:04:24] God. You are a son of God.
[1:04:27] Just live. Just breathe.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the devil will turn tell you
[1:04:37] otherwise. He'll get in your ears. He'll
[1:04:39] get in your mind.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; But you must remember that he is a liar
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; and the father of all lies.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And he don't have the right, are you
[1:04:53] with me now?
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; To rule your soul. Come on.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; You are a son of God.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Don't pay no attention to him.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 24, there was two boys that
[1:05:12] was walking away from the Lord. The
[1:05:15] crucifixion had happened. The disciples
[1:05:18] were bewildered.
[1:05:20] And these two guys were going home. They
[1:05:24] were going home discouraged.
[1:05:28] They were going home wondering what's
[1:05:31] next.
[1:05:36] You know, they they didn't know
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; their leader, their Messiah had been
[1:05:41] crucified and they put him in a grave.
[1:05:43] And at that point, it was even a
[1:05:45] borrowed grave.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; And the treasure of the church had went
[1:05:49] and hung himself.
[1:05:52] Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; They were bewildered.
[1:05:58] They didn't know what to do.
[1:06:02] Who is Jesus?
[1:06:04] What was Jesus? Now they had all kind of
[1:06:07] questions.
[1:06:09] And a man appeared unto them
[1:06:14] and began to walk with him and they
[1:06:17] didn't recognize him. Right.
[1:06:22] And he began to walk with him and and
[1:06:24] ask them, "Why are you distraught? Why
[1:06:28] are you so trouble troubled? Why are you
[1:06:30] so tore up?" And they begin to talk to
[1:06:33] him. Now, it's a six-hour journey. And
[1:06:36] they begin to talk to him. Have you not
[1:06:38] heard?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; We've been following this man for three
[1:06:43] years. We thought
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And Jesus be to talk.
[1:06:49] And he begin to take the words of the
[1:06:51] Old Testament and all the prophets and
[1:06:54] he begin to bring up this this prophecy
[1:06:57] and that prophecy and he would say, "Did
[1:07:00] he fulfill it?"
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Well, yes, he did. And he would bring up
[1:07:04] the prophecies of David. Did he fulfill
[1:07:07] it?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Did he fulfill Jeremiah?
[1:07:11] Yes, he did.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Did he fulfill of Isaiah?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Was he born of a virgin? Yes, he was.
[1:07:18] Was
[1:07:23] he hung on a tree? As a matter of fact,
[1:07:26] he was. Was he wounded for your
[1:07:29] transgressions and bruised for your
[1:07:30] iniquities?
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Did he get beat? Yes, he did.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus could have stopped and had a
[1:07:39] prayer, had a had an oldfashioned sermon
[1:07:41] right here, but he just kept trying to
[1:07:44] get their eyes to come open. Oh,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; did he fulfill? Did he fulfill? Did he
[1:07:50] fulfill? Did he do what he said he would
[1:07:51] do?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, if your eyes ever come open
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:07:58] is, when it comes open,
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; you won't have to worry about 50 people
[1:08:04] trying to convince you of another way.
[1:08:07] When your eyes come open, then you know
[1:08:11] him personally for yourself.
[1:08:15] That's my Jesus. That's my king. That's
[1:08:18] my savior.
[1:08:21] He's my healer.
[1:08:23] He's my mighty God. I trust in him. I
[1:08:27] believe him.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe your your lie.
[1:08:35] I believe him with all my heart.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Now, it came a while
[1:08:45] to where Jesus was getting ready to pass
[1:08:48] their house
[1:08:50] and he made as though he was going to go
[1:08:53] on in his journey.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I want I want to remind you of a simple
[1:09:00] principle.
[1:09:02] He wants to be invited.
[1:09:07] He wants to be invited.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Just something about God. He wants to be
[1:09:11] invited. Oh, he's there, but he wants to
[1:09:14] be invited.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to your
[1:09:18] breakfast table?
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Won't you invite him to your bedroom?
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to supper?
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Why don't you invite him to get in the
[1:09:27] car with you and Rod?
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Won't you invite him to your job? He'll
[1:09:31] come.
[1:09:33] He lays brick. He He's a welder.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; He's a banker.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; He's a preacher.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; How long has it been since you and Jesus
[1:09:45] had some fellowship?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, I'd just like for you
[1:09:49] to come by my house and have coffee.
[1:09:51] Somebody greater than me
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; wants to come to your house.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Does he drink coffer? He
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; brews.
[1:10:01] Amen.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; When I get rid of all this chemo and I
[1:10:05] get my taste buds back, I'm going to
[1:10:07] drink some coffee again.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; I can't wait till that day I can start
[1:10:11] drinking coffee again.
[1:10:20] Some of you missed it. You say, "Well,
[1:10:22] brother, I don't know if God likes
[1:10:24] coffee." He brews
[1:10:33] More of you got it today, but some of
[1:10:35] you get it tomorrow. Some of you get it
[1:10:37] next week. Some of you get it in your
[1:10:40] Bible. You Some of you get it.
[1:10:45] Sir,
[1:10:48] no need to go any further. Why don't you
[1:10:50] come on in? We've enjoyed six hours of
[1:10:52] company. We've enjoyed what you had to
[1:10:54] say. Would you come in?
[1:10:57] We'd like to feed you a little bit.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; We got We got a good drink for you.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; May not be what you're used to eating,
[1:11:07] but we'd like to have you there.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And so being invited, he steps on in
[1:11:15] their house. Now, it might have been a a
[1:11:19] common house. It didn't have to have
[1:11:22] gold on it. It didn't have have to have
[1:11:24] all the best in it. It's your house.
[1:11:29] Hallelujah.
[1:11:31] I don't care if you live in a tent or
[1:11:32] you live in a castle. You need to have
[1:11:35] Jesus there.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And don't forget he's there.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Don't entertain everything else and
[1:11:45] forget Jesus over in a corner.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; They invited him. You know, they had
[1:11:52] bread today.
[1:11:53] special day. Fresh break bread was
[1:11:55] ready.
[1:11:57] And they him being the guest, they said,
[1:12:00] "Won't you break it?"
[1:12:05] Well, that was a good good thing to have
[1:12:08] him as a guest to break bread.
[1:12:13] Now, they had seen Jesus break bread
[1:12:19] because they were there when he fed
[1:12:21] 5,000.
[1:12:24] They had watched him at the communion at
[1:12:26] the last supper breaking bread. It's
[1:12:30] only been just a few days ago, but today
[1:12:33] it's in their house.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine how it felt.
[1:12:39] As I was thinking about it this morning,
[1:12:42] I can't imagine when all the inspiration
[1:12:46] of everything he's told us for six hours
[1:12:49] and now in this moment.
[1:12:54] In this moment, we realize
[1:12:58] that's him.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about what a moment will
[1:13:03] do. It'll heal your body.
[1:13:08] It'll bring peace to your soul
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; in a moment. You go, "That's not just
[1:13:14] the pastor. That's him."
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Let's tell you. And he begins to break
[1:13:25] the bread
[1:13:27] and their eyes come open.
[1:13:31] And he broke their piece. Let me tell
[1:13:33] you something.
[1:13:35] I'm not a selfish person, but I want my
[1:13:38] peace.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not the kind of a guy that's a
[1:13:43] jealous guy, but I want my peace.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you, when I come to
[1:13:48] church,
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not thinking about Walmart.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not thinking about basketball and
[1:13:56] football and baseball.
[1:13:58] I'm not thinking about a cook roast on
[1:14:00] the pot. I'm not thinking about none of
[1:14:02] that. I'm thinking about I got to get to
[1:14:04] Jesus.
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; I can I can only imagine as that piece
[1:14:13] come broke off of that big piece and he
[1:14:16] handed it to Ron.
[1:14:19] This is your piece.
[1:14:21] And when I looked up in those big eyes,
[1:14:27] those eyes
[1:14:29] were crucified for me.
[1:14:37] those hands.
[1:14:40] When he opened his hand with a piece of
[1:14:41] bread in it, there was a duct.
[1:14:46] That's right.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; The only man-made thing in heaven
[1:14:52] will be the nail scars in his hands
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; for an eternal reminder of the price
[1:15:00] that he paid for me and you. Don't never
[1:15:04] allow the cross to be common. Amen.
[1:15:07] Amen.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Don't never allow the blood of Jesus
[1:15:13] Christ to become common words
[1:15:19] over your lips
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; because without it,
[1:15:25] we're lost.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; I don't care if you're the best giver to
[1:15:32] all of the Kowanas and everything else.
[1:15:37] I don't care if you got more deeds than
[1:15:40] anybody else of goodness. Your goodness
[1:15:43] won't save you.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Being born in a certain family won't
[1:15:48] save you.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Being the president of the United States
[1:15:51] of America won't save you.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Without the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:16:00] you're lost.
[1:16:05] One of my favorite preachers was
[1:16:07] preaching
[1:16:08] about 150 years ago.
[1:16:12] What a rough fella Peter Cartwright was.
[1:16:15] And so happened one of the generals had
[1:16:18] stopped by for service
[1:16:20] and the pastor pulled on Peter
[1:16:22] Cartwright's coattail
[1:16:25] and said, "The general,
[1:16:28] top general, is in the building."
[1:16:31] And he said, "I don't care if the
[1:16:33] general's in the building. If he's not
[1:16:35] born again, that's right.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; If he's not born again by the blood of
[1:16:39] Jesus Christ, he's lost and he's going
[1:16:42] to a devil's hell."
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; The next morning, the general knocked on
[1:16:48] his door
[1:16:51] and he said, "Mr. Gartright,
[1:16:54] I want to thank you.
[1:16:58] I want to thank you for telling me the
[1:17:00] truth.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; If every one of my soldiers,
[1:17:06] if every one of my soldiers had the
[1:17:09] fight that you have for Jesus Christ,
[1:17:11] we'd win the war overnight.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:22] when their eyes came open,
[1:17:25] they saw it was Jesus Christ.
[1:17:29] I think sometimes we must remember
[1:17:31] that he's our champion.
[1:17:34] So many times as young people, we get
[1:17:36] the idea that Michael Jordan is a
[1:17:38] champion, and he is in this realm. Elvis
[1:17:43] Presley was a king of rock and roll.
[1:17:46] But you can have all of that and not
[1:17:47] have Jesus Christ
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; and you're lost.
[1:17:53] I think sometimes we get this idea that
[1:17:55] this guy is bigger than life. This this
[1:17:58] great person, this great personality is
[1:18:00] bigger than life. But if they're not if
[1:18:03] they're not saved and born again,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; they're lost.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Be careful who you make your hero.
[1:18:13] That's right.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; That wasn't a part of the sermon, but
[1:18:16] that's that's that's good enough for
[1:18:17] you.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? In Psalms chapter 23,
[1:18:25] the Lord is my shepherd,
[1:18:29] I shall not want.
[1:18:32] He maketh me to lie down in green
[1:18:34] pastures,
[1:18:35] and he leadth me beside of the still
[1:18:37] waters. He restoth my soul, and he
[1:18:41] leadth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:18:43] for his name's sake.
[1:18:45] And yay, though I walk through the
[1:18:46] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[1:18:48] fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[1:18:54] Thy rod and thy staff, they do comfort
[1:18:56] me.
[1:19:00] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[1:19:02] presence of my enemy. Thou anointest my
[1:19:05] head with all, and my cup runth over.
[1:19:08] Notice these next words. Surely goodness
[1:19:10] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[1:19:12] of my life, and I will dwell in the
[1:19:14] house of the Lord forever.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand, God dwells in
[1:19:18] the praises of his people.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And if you ever want him to come, just
[1:19:26] start praising him.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; So many people are afraid to praise God.
[1:19:32] Come on.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; They're afraid to praise the Lord
[1:19:37] because they may get a little out of You
[1:19:39] didn't mind it at a ball game.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; You didn't mind it at a race car.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; You didn't mind it at a hockey game.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I got all those Canadians right there,
[1:19:50] didn't I?
[1:19:52] And for the Europeans that are watching
[1:19:54] today, you didn't mind it at a soccer
[1:19:56] match.
[1:19:58] Listen,
[1:20:00] God deserves our praise.
[1:20:03] [Applause]
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; He deserves our worship.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; He deserves it.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Whether you feel like it or you don't
[1:20:23] feel like it,
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; whether you're in the mood or you're not
[1:20:26] in the mood, Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You might feel like
[1:20:32] God's 10 million miles away, but he
[1:20:34] might be. But he hears hears your
[1:20:37] prayer. He still hears your praise.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, it's been a big
[1:20:45] question. Do you know him?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; In John chapter one, and this is going
[1:20:52] to be my closing scripture today.
[1:20:56] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:20:59] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:21:04] The same was in the beginning with God
[1:21:07] and all things were made by him and
[1:21:10] without him was not anything made that
[1:21:12] was made. In him was life and the life
[1:21:16] was the light of men. And the light
[1:21:19] shineth in darkness and darkness
[1:21:21] comprehendeth it not.
[1:21:24] There was a man sent from God whose name
[1:21:26] was John.
[1:21:29] And the same came for a witness to bear
[1:21:31] witness of that light that all men
[1:21:33] through him might believe.
[1:21:36] He was not the light but was sent to
[1:21:39] bear witness of that light. That was the
[1:21:42] true light which lighteneth every man
[1:21:44] that cometh into the world.
[1:21:46] He was in the world and the world was
[1:21:49] made by him and the world knew him not.
[1:22:01] The Jews don't know him. I'm sorry. They
[1:22:05] thought they thought he was a man.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; But I believe in a short time they're
[1:22:12] getting ready to find out who he was.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; We've all got common sense here. I hope
[1:22:17] we do.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; And we know America needs to know him.
[1:22:22] Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; No matter what political affiliation you
[1:22:26] are,
[1:22:28] America has lost its way.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; 40 thousand 40,000 different
[1:22:36] denominations in the world and they
[1:22:39] still can't figure out who he was.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I'll say just a couple more things here.
[1:22:47] Who is Jesus? He's my king. That's
[1:22:50] right.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; I am a citizen of another kingdom.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; This world is not my home.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; I'm only passing through.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Anya, let me just share this
[1:23:05] with you. This week, I went to the I
[1:23:07] went to see the cancer team, brain
[1:23:09] cancer team.
[1:23:12] Had a test run, had my MRIs run. I came
[1:23:16] in and I I saw a doctor and the first
[1:23:20] doctor I began to tell him how that I I
[1:23:23] I couldn't throw a ba a baseball or a
[1:23:26] football and and catch with my my
[1:23:28] grandchildren because I see two balls
[1:23:31] coming. I said, "Therefore, we we throw
[1:23:34] foam balls."
[1:23:41] And so he he just talked to me. He said,
[1:23:44] "Well, how do you do on steps?" I said,
[1:23:45] "Well, at home, I don't have any
[1:23:47] problems." I said, "But at church or I
[1:23:49] had problems with steps." He said, "At
[1:23:52] home, you've got muscle memory."
[1:23:54] He said, "But when you climb somebody
[1:23:56] else's steps or you climb other steps,
[1:23:58] you have to watch each one that you make
[1:24:00] the next step or the step down the next
[1:24:02] step." He said, "I can't fix that." He
[1:24:05] said, "That's damage from the brain
[1:24:08] surgery that you had."
[1:24:10] Begin to talk. He's light-hearted fell.
[1:24:12] is just wonderful guy that we talked to
[1:24:13] and he was with me for about a half an
[1:24:15] hour and then the head head doctor come
[1:24:19] in. You've met him and he come in and he
[1:24:23] sat down and he talked to me and he
[1:24:25] said, "Well, your brain scan is clear."
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[1:24:43] Now, in saying that, they consider me
[1:24:45] still a fourth stage cancer fighting
[1:24:48] cancer deal because the big stuff's not
[1:24:50] working. The little stuff that they
[1:24:52] don't pay no attention to is in there.
[1:24:54] So, we continued to take chemo every
[1:24:55] day. I don't like it. Wears me out,
[1:24:58] makes me sick, make me a lot of
[1:24:59] different things. And so he recorded and
[1:25:02] he recorded and recorded and then he
[1:25:03] came to a certain spot and he hit his
[1:25:05] recorder and said now I want to talk to
[1:25:07] you now you'll be interested in this and
[1:25:11] he said we have conferences to where
[1:25:13] that we gather doctors from all over the
[1:25:15] world
[1:25:16] and he said we talk about brain
[1:25:18] metastasis and he said in and and it
[1:25:21] comes from your lungs it comes from all
[1:25:23] over your body and it travels into the
[1:25:25] brain and he said somewhere between
[1:25:27] cancer and your body it will begin to
[1:25:29] communicate with the cancer that goes
[1:25:31] into your brain and they communicate
[1:25:33] backwards and forwards. He said there's
[1:25:35] a blood band, you probably know this,
[1:25:37] you're Mr. He said there's a blood band
[1:25:39] between your brain and your body and he
[1:25:42] said that's the why we keep giving you
[1:25:44] chemo because it takes that chemo so
[1:25:48] long to get up in that brain to work.
[1:25:51] Now, you know, they're they're telling
[1:25:53] me sentences of death, but the Bible
[1:25:55] tells me sentences of life. Amen.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And he he said, "We have a conference
[1:26:00] about every three months." And he said,
[1:26:01] "We gather these doctors from all over
[1:26:03] the world."
[1:26:06] And he looked at me, he said, put his
[1:26:08] hands on my knees and he said, "I would
[1:26:10] like for you to be a spokesman for us."
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:27] He said, "We don't have another one like
[1:26:29] you."
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; What'd you do, brother Ron? I accepted
[1:26:52] the job. What do you think I would do?
[1:26:56] Hallelujah.
[1:27:00] That's my Jesus.
[1:27:10] Isn't he wonderful to us today?
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Isn't he wonderful to us today? Thank
[1:27:15] you. Thank you for being here.
[1:27:20] Don't you love him?
[1:27:22] Amen.
[1:27:25] Amen. Are we ready for the Lord's
[1:27:27] supper? Amen.
[1:27:29] Hope I didn't hold you too long. I
[1:27:31] wanted to make time for the Lord's
[1:27:33] supper and the communion, the foot
[1:27:34] washing.
[1:27:36] And we welcome everybody to to be a part
[1:27:39] of this today. I pray that we all sit at
[1:27:42] the same table one of these days,
[1:27:44] thousands of miles long.
[1:27:47] If you're a sinner today and don't know
[1:27:48] the Lord, I want to tell you, he's here
[1:27:50] for you. You just ask Jesus into your
[1:27:52] heart. Ask, "Forgive me of my sins,
[1:27:56] Lord. Come into my life. I want to serve
[1:27:58] you the rest of the days of my life." If
[1:28:00] you're so sick you can't stand yourself,
[1:28:02] won't you ask him to heal you?
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Won't you ask him to heal you?
[1:28:09] Amen.
[1:28:12] I was so weary this morning. I didn't
[1:28:14] know if I was going to be able to preach
[1:28:15] this sermon, but a certain buddy came
[1:28:17] back and prayed for me. He laid his
[1:28:20] hands on me and said, "Lord, give him
[1:28:21] the strength to preach." I want to thank
[1:28:23] you. I want to thank you. I want to
[1:28:26] thank you,
[1:28:30] brother Ron. You're getting all those
[1:28:31] good reports, but you don't understand.
[1:28:33] I've been on chemo for five and a half
[1:28:35] years.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And it's worked on my body.
[1:28:39] And so, thank God Connie regulates the
[1:28:43] naps.
[1:28:46] Naps. Naps.
[1:28:51] Amen.
[1:28:53] Amen. God bless you.

[1:29:06] For I have received of the Lord that
[1:29:08] which also I have delivered unto you,
[1:29:11] that the Lord Jesus,
[1:29:13] the same night in which he was betrayed,
[1:29:16] he took bread,
[1:29:19] and when he had given, he broke and
[1:29:21] said, "Take, eat. This is my body which
[1:29:25] is broken for you.
[1:29:28] This do in remembrance of me." And after
[1:29:32] the same manner also he took the cup and
[1:29:35] when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is
[1:29:37] the new testament, and my body this do
[1:29:40] you as often as you drink in remembrance
[1:29:43] of me. For as often as you drink this
[1:29:46] bread,
[1:29:48] eat this bread, and drink this cup, you
[1:29:51] do show the Lord's death until he
[1:29:54] comes."
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:01] Who am I that the highest
[1:30:05] would welcome
[1:30:08] me?
[1:30:11] I was lost but he brought me. Oh, his
[1:30:15] love for me.
[1:30:20] Oh, his love for me.

[1:31:21] I'm a child of God. Yes, I am.
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:31] In my father's
[1:31:34] house,
[1:31:36] there's a place
[1:31:39] for me.
[1:31:41] I'm a child of God.
[1:31:46] Yes, I am.
[1:31:51] At this time, we're going to dismiss the
[1:31:53] uh viewing audience. Just want to say
[1:31:55] God bless you. Thank you for being a
[1:31:57] part of our service today. Amen.
