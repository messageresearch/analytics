denise schifflett we're thankful to have sister denise in the house and the lord this evening we're praying for a full recovery for her this evening and just just god will work in a mighty way i just want to take a little bit of time here we want to be remembering our pastor brother ron spencer this this past week had a little bit of rough week if if some of you heard he after the meetings there he was a little weak had cough monday morning we went or not monday but tuesday i believe it was we went for a breakfast and i could tell something wasn't right and he was scheduled to have some scans and things done that day and i told him i said dad dad what's your oxygen level today you just don't send me right had a bad cough you know someone might have heard it his oxygen level had been low and before we had went to eat there his sugar started to drop on him a little bit so we sat down to eat his oxygen level dropped his blood pressure dropped and his sugar dropped all at the same time and for some of the nurses that are in the building all you know that that is not a good combination at all [Music] let me just say that it was a scary situation [Music] the hand of the lord was with dad that he made it through that so we pray that god will just touch his body the ambulance had to come take him to the hospital he did not have to stay in the hospital so we thank the lord for that there have been some notes sent out that he was in the hospital and he was about to die in the hospital but he didn't about die in the hospital he was coming close there at the restaurant so but he has pneumonia in his lungs and he has a collapsed lung so on top of everything else that he's going through he battled through that this week and uh so we they were not able to do scans but they will be doing those at a later time so we're praying that god would just touch his body in a mighty way me and the family will be protecting them even more so and being proactive as some other ministers have asked us to do so so some of his schedule will either get cancelled bumped and moved to a later date so we we pray as a church family that god touches his body and he can be used here in our congregation and maybe through the streaming other ministers can be able to have meetings that way we we just want to protect him and we pray that god will just heal him but until we get a full recovery we're going to do our very best to be proactive and watch over our pastor amen so we want to pray for him he will he has planned to speak for us in the morning and [Music] so he said you know if i if i just give 30 minutes i said dad if you give 15 that'll wear the devil out [Music] you know so we're believing we're believers but we are also going to be very cautious and give let the lord

you father but lord more than a building tonight lord we want to dedicate our hearts lord once again lord refresh us lord jesus send thee the season of refreshment lord we know that we're here and we ask lord you'd send the rain lord i pray that you'd wash us and make as white as snow father i pray tonight that there would come just such a liberty lord in this place father that that you would be

to open up the word to us lord make it real make it fresh make it lord make it new to us lord many of us sitting here veterans lord know these know this message in and out know the scriptures in and

name of the lord jesus christ we pray these things amen and amen if you have your bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of acts chapter 3 verse 19 and then also down to revelations chapter 3 and verse 14. i'd like to greet each and every one of you in the name of the lord said god richly bless you amen it's an honor to have our lord jesus christ in the house of the lord amen amen amen isn't he wonderful to us he brought us through another week and set our feet up on a rock to stay amen acts chapter 3 and verse 19 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and he shall send jesus which before was preached unto you till the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all of his holy prophets since the world began for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you revelations chapter 3 and verse 14. and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i love what brother branham said in the church age book he said before he dives into it he gives us one last look of himself right here he is the amen he is faithful he is the true witness and the beginning of the creation of god notice the message he said i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest i am rich notice who is saying this because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and of need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment and that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou mayest see as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i'd like to speak to you this evening on the zeal of the hour the zeal of the hour and the grounds for receiving and as we just dive into these these texts we realize that that is that is the the message of the day it is the zeal of the hour is is to repent we realize that love is the most powerful force that there is upon the face of the earth it's amazing how that human love and how that human love makes a man or makes human beings act and then also we realize that there's a godly love there's a felio love and then there's an agape love and we realize that there is such power in love and we realize that brother branham would tell us that love is one of the most powerful forces that there is upon the earth and he said only only power lays in love and it's amazing it's amazing what we do as human beings what love will make us do it love will make us drive across a nation just to find a lover love will will make us stand up and stand for our children and it'll make us stand up in the midst of fear and it's amazing what love does love cast out all fear love will make you stand up maybe maybe you might be a little bit weaker than somebody else but love will make you stand up for your wife love will do things that that maybe you wouldn't necessarily do is that right that's what love will do and real real human love it it will go beyond what you can even imagine what love would do love will make a human being run through a burning build and just to save their child love will make will make you go towards somebody it'll draw you to somebody there's a major difference between love and hatred and if somebody hates you they're not going to draw you they're not going to draw you to themselves but if somebody loves you there's an atmosphere that is around love that love will invite you in love will invite you in and make you make you a part of its home make you a part of its life love let you know that you're welcome and if we can express that in human love how much more with a godly love with a love that is from above how much more is his love running after us and is chasing after us and making sure that we don't get in no trouble that we can't get out of he loves us so much that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him would not perish but have everlasting life but yet love is corrective love will not allow your child to sit out in a street and you just sit back there and say well little johnny we understand little johnny he's okay he's got a mind but yet you'll run out there real love will make you run out there brother branham said love he said love he said he said if your wife he said if you really love your wife and your wife comes in and says honey i'm going to go out and i'm going to run around on another man i'm going to run around with another man i'm going to run around with i'm going to run around with this guy and and you know as a husband he said you wouldn't sit there and say well honey i hope you have a good time but love will stand there and say hold up that's that's that's not gonna happen here you see love is corrective love will not stand for things that stand up in the way of what really true love is and god is love the only reason that we can understand love is because god is love and so we realize that the correction of god is the love of god and if we can understand or if we can receive if we can receive chastisement it shows that we are sons and we're not bastards but it shows us who we are if we can understand or receive the very things of god that he causes us to go into but love will allow us to fall deeper in love with him i'm so glad that he saved me that he loved me good so much that even when i was in the midst of my crisis or in the midst of my chaos and even though i may have been having a good time because sin is pleasurable for a season i'm so glad that his love outstretched my grace or my thoughts i'm so glad that his love was a chastisement love that would stop me in my tracks and keep me from scars and keep me from troubles and keep me from heartaches his love is powerful this evening and if you can recognize it'll make you if you can recognize the love of god it'll make you repent of all your sins it'll make you it'll make you run to him like never before is that right you see but notice what jesus is speaking here in the in the message to the church he's not necessarily speaking to sinners but he's preaching too he's preaching to the church that that she is to be zealous of him and repent of her lukewarm condition notice what the message is is the same exact message that was that that john the baptist was out there and he was preaching to the pharisees the sadducees and the heathens and it was repent and brother branham said there was no other course then and there is no other course now there was no other way to get back to god then and there's no other way to get back to god now is that is to repent and it's amazing to think to me that people how that they will stand there with such a heart and heart won't repent of their sins but why would you do that and stay there in a spot and die in a place when all you've got to do is say god i'm sorry but not just words but it comes from the heart now notice what brother man have said in the laodicean church aids he said be zealous and repent he said now this false church has a zeal he said make no mistake about that he said her zeal has literally literally been that of the jews john 2 and 17 the zeal of that house hath eaten me up and remember what jesus said there when when he was standing there in the house of god and he walked in there and he flipped over the money changers and the disciples remembered he re they remembered that the scripture said that thy zeal of thine house had eaten me up you remember that david would quote that in psalm 69 but yet here god jesus was standing there and he was fulfilling that and preaching the scripture that the zeal of thine house have eaten me up he said but this is a wrong zeal it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own creeds and dogmas and organization he said their own righteousness they have the put they have put the word out for their own ideas and they disposed they disposed the holy ghost and made men into leaders it shows that this church age has removed the holy ghost out of his office out of the church noticed what they did and they made men under their leaders he said they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even church conformity rather than the good works he said but god is calling for another zeal it is a zeal to cry i am wrong i'm gonna tell you if you're ever gonna have a happy marriage in life you're gonna have to learn those words i am sorry i am wrong and if you're ever going to have a great relationship with god you've got to understand the ability to say and express i am wrong god i am sorry the reason why david was a man after god's own heart was because he was quick to repent david was a man that was full of mistakes and full of failures but david knew how to call on the name of the lord and repent of his sins but notice notice he said that he's calling for another zeal to say that i am wrong he said but now who is going to say that he's wrong he said now he goes on to say he said i don't believe that god is calling only the false church to repent in this verse he is also talking to his elect he said they have some repentant to do too he goes on to say he said they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn towards the truth you see you can change your hair and come around this message and let your hair grow you can change your dress to make yourself look like a part but that ain't really the part that god's looking for you can change your makeup and wash it off of your face you can change your lover and you can change your styles but to god the most powerful thing that you can do is have a change of heart it ain't just about a change in your mind or a change in your self-will but it's a change on the inside of your heart i'm going to preach to you like you never heard this before this evening but the most powerful thing about you is to have a change of heart you see every single one of us are sitting here is rotten scoundrels we ain't nothing but a bunch of badger skins we were mean we were good for nothing let me just go over in the scripture say paul would say that there would be no adulterers and there would be no fornicators and there would be no whoremongers that would ever make it unto god or never make it into the kingdom of god but it goes down a little bit further and i find it so amazing that there are people that sit in churches year after year and decades and they they can't give out the same mercy that they received but paul didn't stop there he said but such were some of you i find it so amazing that message people think because they are the last stage people or the final voice or the final age that they can cast a shadow on somebody or or maybe they can throw over a reflection of well this one's not good enough let me tell you if we're not good enough to testify of the message of jesus christ to a baptist or a methodist or a presbyterian then this ain't the message but the message that i live and the message that came by my way what's good enough what's good enough to go to any baptist it's good enough it's though this message don't make us no greater than anybody else if you measure us down and shoot us up or shoot us down we're still human beings made out of 16 elements and every single one of us if it were not for the grace of god we'd be still setting out there in that dead cold form of religion but the message whoa what a message it's not a message of judgment it's a message of grace that came by our way oh how we ought to be thankful that god cared so much for you and i [Applause] the kingdom of god is not meat the kingdom of god is not materialistic it's not apparel but brother branham would say in the token in dallas texas in 1964 he said it's god's blood-bound promises that make you and i free it ain't the way you dress yes i believe you ought to dress holy yes i believe you brother's not a you're not out of we wearing skinny jeans and looking like a i believe you sisters ought to dress like women but it ain't that that makes you holy because you can go down to walmart maybe not in walmart no more but you can go up to main street exchange and buy yourself a dress but just because you got yourself a dress does not mean that your message but the inside of the inside is what makes the message let me preach to you a moment on this thought right here it's the blood-bound promises of god that makes you and i free it ain't our dress it ain't ourselves it ain't our emotion it's the blood of jesus christ that made every single one of us free notice what jesus when jesus begins to sit down and have supper with his friends he sets down his supper in mark chapter two you find that he shuts down and he's sitting down there with his disciples and he's sitting down with the publicans and the sinners and he comes there and there the pharisees and the priests come in and they look on him and they look at the disciples and have a conversation with the disciples that said why is it that your so-called messiah isn't sitting down and having dinner with us but he's sitting out there with uh with republicans with the common people and sitting out there with sinners and when jesus heard about it the bible said when jesus heard about it he spent to them and he said them that are whole don't need a physician but those that are sick need a physician and he said i came not to call the righteous he said but i came to call sinners under repentance i say this to you jesus was not ashamed to go by the woman of the well jesus wasn't ashamed to go by to go by the they go by the way of nicodemus he wasn't ashamed to go by the lepers and heal him on the sabbath he wasn't ashamed to go by harley and call her unto himself he wasn't ashamed to walk down to a harlot and a prodigal and this that or the other he was not ashamed to walk by your way but he did not leave them where he found them he came to call the sinners unto repentance he was not ashamed to stand up for you when nobody else would stand up for you there might be a spot in your life in your life young people that you're ashamed to call on jesus but let me preach to you on this thought there's going to come a spot in your life when you're going to need this jesus there's going to come a time in your life maybe you're sitting in that spot right now when you're too cool to call jesus name or you're too cool to live this message but there's gonna come a time in life maybe why you're burning in hell that you wish you would have been cool with the message [Applause] all right let's preach just a little bit tonight he said my brothers and elijah the message elijah he said brother what we need tonight over the whole nation he's an old-fashioned god sent revival repentance for every every church and every individual to come back to god to the true living god not to psychology not to theology of the church but what we need to do is come back to the true and living god who changes a man's heart his nature he changes his makeup makes him a new creature in christ jesus who kills all the nature of the world and makes a person a new creature he said oh christian friends he said that's what the world needs tonight he said we don't need a program he said we need the regular program that christ said at calvary when he was here on earth he said except a man be born again he will in no wise enter the kingdom of god he said that's what we need tonight well i'll tell you this we don't need some we don't need some some aaa meeting to get our drunks out of the out of the bottle let me tell you one time in his presence was said an alcoholic free i understand the power of addictions i understand the power of sin and the power of those things but i'll tell you one time in his presence will break an addiction addiction an addiction to porn and addiction alcohol an addiction to cigarettes an addiction to tobacco and addiction to the worldly things of this life one time in his presence will break your cycle over your life is that right we don't need we don't need psychology psychology won't work we got too many man man-made preachers trying to stand behind the pulpit and preach psychology muhammad if we needed psychology we'd have stayed with muhammad or we couldn't went back there to buddha or went back to concern confucius and those men or could we could have went out there to the religiosity of the world where they ain't got no power to save nobody much more than a lifesaver meant it's got power to save somebody that's drowned it the world church world ain't got no power in it because they don't like a blood religion and any religion they don't have the blood of jesus christ is a powerless religion let me tell you the only real truth is jesus christ it is the very essence of the message is that he is risen from the dead and you and i are his beneficiaries is that right well you see what repents is repentance is a hatred of sin it's it's a turning away from sin and a determination in the strength of god to forsake it but if we're ever living in an hour when men are aligned they're relying on themselves or they're relying on self-confidence that i understand this or i i can handle this but our goal is to rely on god we are strictly relying on the very life of god and we can simply put no confidence in our flesh you can't put no confidence in your mind because in your mind is where you reason at but you recognize when brother branham would preach on how can i overcome and he would say that he was crossing over that old dodie log out there he said i watched it it was a great it was a great strong tree he said but what made it doty was the life went out of it and when the life of jesus christ goes out on an individual or goes out of a church you can write ichabod across that church or ichabod across that individual but when the life of jesus is there you'll find a strong church or a strong individual i had i had a youth youth deal years ago and not here but it was a way and these the these youth were asking now what what if we have a problem who do we go to or where do we run to do we run to a pastor or do we can we call the deacon or do we do we call do we call an elder in a church let me tell you there's going to come times in your life when you can't get a hold of the pastor you can't get a hold of the deacons you can't get a hold of associates you're going to have to find yourself on an old altar maybe out no shed somewhere and find yourself a real experience with god i believe we've got strong believers here but there's times when you don't need to call on them you need to get on your knees for yourself this ain't this ain't about being confident in yourself it's about being confident in the king the prince of life and it's constantly staying in life not a mental understanding but this repentance is a change of your nature a change of your desire the reason why we preach to you the message because it's the only message that'll get you out of here i ain't got no confidence i ain't got no confidence in men but i do have confidence in this message i ain't got confident in men's teachings outside of this message but i do have confidence in the word of god and that's why we stand here and we preach to you listen to the message play those tapes when you're not here feed on the word of god you see there's a purpose in feeding on the very word of god it's to live constantly in an atmosphere where christ is welcome you're gonna have to have church all by yourself sometimes is that right there's going to be some times when you don't feel like a real christian there's going to be some times when you've been run over every which away from the spirit of anxiety the spirit of fear and the spirit of laodicea and you're going to have to have yourself some church is anybody ever had church all by themselves ever had to call on god by themselves ever been in the valley all by themselves but god didn't leave you down in a valley god didn't leave you in church all by yourself the bible said that with you begin to praise him that he will come down [Applause] maybe people say well i'm afraid if i get this kind of religion what it'll make me do how to make me act or what others think but let me point you through some scriptures let me point you to some ladies and ladies in the grace of the lord jesus christ that wasn't ashamed wasn't ashamed to get down they wasn't ashamed about how jesus would make them they wasn't ashamed how it would make them look in their social standing that's the biggest problem that we find with teenagers today is they want a social standing amongst the social crowd that don't give a care what you look like in person only what you care about what you look about on your instagram well i'm gonna have a good time but the woman when jesus when she found jesus all in a room tucked over in a corner all by himself tucked over there where nobody else had made him feel welcome and simon only brought him there so that he could mock him brought him in there he didn't welcome him with a kiss he didn't anoint him with oil he didn't wash his feet he didn't wash his feet off the dust of the earth he didn't wash off the cow manure and the horse manure and the donkey men were off of his feet and he just set him over there in a corner i'm afraid that's too many people's problem today they set jesus in a corner there this woman when she began to see that there was one that she'd heard about sitting in a corner she wasn't going to stand for that and i found brother barnum said that when she was there at his feet he said she was bathing his feet with the tears of repentance with a true heart with true repentance brother branham would say in washington's feet he said she didn't care what anybody else thought about what she looked like she didn't care what anybody else thought how that she should not be in there you know by the standards they could have took the law of the day and cast her out of there because she was not invited in there but she didn't care if the law came in there and kicked her out but she was going in there to make jesus feel welcome he said she was crying brother branham said he said she was hysterical the way that she was crying he said but the time that i got in his presence he said i was hysterical too he said she could barely hold herself together he said when i got in his presence he said i could barely hold myself together and if you ever get in the presence of jesus christ brother branham said he said they was going to excommunicate me from the church he's but i didn't care i was in his presence let me tell you the time to worship him is not when you leave the building it's right now when you feel the shekinah come down it's not a time to wonder did i miss it just jump in if the healing angel's in the water brother step in she didn't care she found love she never found love in those other men's hearts she found forgiveness she didn't find forgiveness in another man's arms but what she found in god's wrapped gift was the one that could repent that she could repent to and wash her sins away but repentance repents as a complete reversal of one's attitudes and values you see what you value in life is what you deem important and what you value right now before repentance will be completely opposite than what you what you value after your repentance you see if you value social life or if you value sustainability amongst humanity it'll be completely turned around and you'll value spiritual life you'll value sustainability just like abraham was sustained because repentance turned you away from what you were to what god wants you to be repents is powerful you remember when ahab when ahab coveted nabos vineyard he got all upset and got pouty about and he went back to his jezebel wife back there and got to poutine about it said naboth won't sell it to me he won't bargain with me he won't barter with me and jezebel contrived in herself and conjured up a plan that they put nabe off to death we'll get that vendor for you ahab don't you worry about this you better watch if you get yourself a jezebel wife she'll get you in trouble i want this vineyard so bad that i'm willing to kill somebody for it but notice what the prophet came to him and said the dogs that licked up nabos blood will be the dogs that lick up your blood if you go down there in first kings 21 you'll find that ahab was in awe and he repented and god said i will not visit evil in his day but i will visit the evil in his son's day but you flip over one chapter more and you'll find that ahab that ahab rebelled against on god and he tried to disguise himself and notice when they when the king when the when they when the kings came up there and they shot the arrow and they killed ahab notice the dogs licked his blood right there in naboth's vineyard you see what nahab was he was a slave to his own transgressions it wasn't true repentance it didn't come from his heart god may give him a repeat a reprieve in time but yet god was still he didn't humble himself ahab didn't humble himself and he was a slave to transgressions and you may come to a spot in your life yourselves and you might humble yourself before god or somebody and somebody might humble themselves before god just for for a for a time but yet they remain a slave to their transgressions people may be afraid of damnation but they're not afraid of sin and people might be afraid of hell but they're not afraid to do their iniquities people might be afraid of being cast into a pit but they're not afraid of hardening their hearts towards god's commandments agrippa when paul stood up there and preached to him christ crucified the bible said that agrippa said thou almost persuades me to be a christian but notice his persuasion was not that of repentance because the bible said in first second corinthians 7 and 10 that for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death repentance got to come from your heart even judas even judas the bible said repented they said well brother andrew i've repented judas repented you can find in matthew 27 that judas goes when he sees that they're condemning jesus i'm trying to find the message just now but anyways i'll find it for you and i'll give it to you if you need it but brother brandon said that judas it was in lean not to your own understanding that judas was leaning to his own understanding and he thought jesus could get himself out of this mess and he sold him out for 30 pieces of silver and when they seen when he seen that jesus wasn't going to get out of this and they were condemning him to the cross the bible said that judas repented of himself and went before the high priest and he cast the money down and they said what is that to us and the bible said that he repented himself he repented himself but notice where this repentance did it took him to the gallows it didn't take him to christ heart repentance will lead you to a cross but just because you corrupted yourself and corrupted the kingdom of god and just because you cried because you did a crime does not mean its heart repentance judas was a castaway and he could not get back to christ because he truly did not know how to get to pentecost repentance leads the sinner to the savior that's what repentance do now watch let me show you what repentance will do in ezekiel 18 and 30. the bible said therefore i will judge you o house of israel everyone according to his ways saith the lord repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so that iniquity shall not be your ruin young people write that scripture down cast away from all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will you die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that died saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live do you recognize what repentance does repentance turns you from death unto life that's the power of true repentance god i'm sorry god i didn't mean to do that god i made a mistake there is power into repentance notice where your repentance takes you if it's a repentance that'll lead you right back up to sin it's not heart repentance but heart repentance will only lead you back to the word if there ever was an hour that repents needed to be preached it's this hour it's the zeal of the hour it's to say god i'm sorry i've often said it that redemption that redemption is like a magnet it's got a positive and it's a negative i always enjoyed science class class sticking those sticking those magnets together i guess we i'm the only one here that played with magnets in science class maybe y'all were off listening or listening to the teacher and i was over playing the magnets i always loved i always enjoyed i always enjoyed watching those magnets there's two sides of that magnet there's a positive side and there's a negative side and you watch you push that positive side against a positive side and it'll push away and you watch that negative what it do it'll pull the positive to it and that's what redemption does it pushes away the world and pulls christ to you that's what christ does he magnetizes you to the spirit and when there are things that are held down there are things that are held down by co-former religion there are things that have been magnetized to the spirit that cannot stay there in some dead cold formal dead idea they've got to get up and wear the spirits out of moving out that's what redemption does it draws you it draws you unto him and do you realize that when you repent brother branham says you are back i got that's a direct quote for you honey when you repent you are back your sins are forgiven and you're a candidate for the baptism of the holy ghost when you repent you're back to the kingdom oh i'm looking at some people that made their way back if a salmon knows how to get back to its birthplace where are the sons and daughters of god know how to return to their true birthplace i say this to you mamas and daddies to encourage you the bible said raise up your child in the way that they'll go and they will not forget it if they're a son they know how to make their way back the prodigal is waking up into himself he might be in a hog pin but he's coming hello hello i got satan didn't want that the prodigal is waking up and he's coming to himself [Applause] oh satan he tried to shut me up the prodigal is waking up to himself it may be somebody that's over 50 years old but they still might be a prodigal there might be a mom or a daddy that's already made it over to glory land but there's prodigals that are coming back to themselves hallelujah that's what redemption is doing it's going after those you're predestinated your seed is the only thing that keeps you predestinated and let me tell you church if you're seed of god if you're a seed of abraham you can't be lost he might be hunting all over for you like the man in luke 15 looking for his coin or looking for a sheep jesus was preaching to predestination right there in luke chapter 15. notice when that when that man when the one sheep went away from the flock of 9 9 what did he do he said well i guess it'll be okay i can live with these 99 absolutely not he said now 99 and a half just won't do what did he do he left the 99 to go get the one let me tell you i was that one he came looking for me he came looking for me i wonder if we could have a testimony for legion right here just now i was that one i was that one back there in a cave i was that one that cut myself i was that one that nobody wanted me i was that one no denomination could handle me but when i was all when all hope was gone when chains couldn't hold me no more when i couldn't find no pleasure in the caves and in the gambling in the alcohol no more when i thought that nobody come looking for me i lost my family i lost everything but there one day he came looking for me legion would you like to testify for a minute less i'd like to testify just for a minute i'd like to testify just for a minute jesus cared so much about me that two thousand demons wouldn't stop him from getting to me jesus loved me so much that he wouldn't let me stay one more night out there in that prison your time this is not the time to give up to give up won't you try one more time you might shock yourself you might shock yourself how successful you'll be because on the inside of you is the potential to be a real son of god let me tell you daniel didn't stop when they made fun of him daniel didn't stop when they taught him that he couldn't pray daniel didn't stop praying he actually threw up the curtains he said if you don't like that watch this daniel didn't stop his prayer life because somebody else was giving up hope on praying to a living god daniel didn't give up hope when they told him that he had to bow or the three hubert children had to bow daniel didn't give up hope when they threw him in a lion's den daniel stood steadfast in the faith that was once delivered to the saints hallelujah you see when the word of god begins to get preached you watch a reaction he wants a reaction i got said something here in the last week i won't say what day but i got sent something there wasn't nothing more than a ted talk that wouldn't have no power to resurrect nobody much less a little fish but when god sends preaching by the way it causes a reaction is that right there ain't no room in the pulpit for a ted talk or for a pumping up talk there is only room for power and demonstration is that right that's what paul said that the preaching of the word was demonstration and in power let me tell you if you want to see a change in your life get your children get your family under the preaching of the word and when the word is preached it'll cause a reaction it'll cause a reaction you remember you when i tell you this story you'll remember what i'm talking about so you could say i remember after i tell you about it all right so i remember all right that's good i'm glad you're on the same page i am we remember together but you remember when brother brandon was up here in kentucky and he said he was holding a meeting up there for about a year he was up there preaching and he was preaching on a message on repent or perish and he said there he was in that country and he said that's logging country and he said they was up there in them mountains and he said there i'd heard about this rough crowd that was coming and he said how do you start to remember all right that's good you're starting to come to remembrance remember all right and they're up here and these people brother brandon was told that he was the roughest people in that country and he said they come up there with the intention that we're going to go up there and we're going to throw that little preacher out the window make a mockery of him but brother baram said he stayed there too long one night and he said i got to preaching on repent or perish and he stood there he stood there and he said before long his hands was up in the air and he was making his way down to the altar he said he couldn't get there fast enough he'd come there with one intention but by the preaching of the word repent came to its spot it caused a reaction because the word of god will cause you to react to the word of god you're going to walk out of here one way or another tonight i don't care how great a christian you are or how deep a deep a philosopher you are tonight it doesn't matter how you walked in here you're going to walk out of here better or weaker and i choose to walk out of here on the positive side of things are you remembering but brother branham said that there was a he said in that meeting he said there was an alcoholic and he said i began to preach and he said i stood there and i he said i stood there and i began to preach you drunkards turn away from your ways repent or perish and that man got mad at brother branham got angry and walked out of the building i've had him do that to me too they'll walk out on you but brother brown said that he was staying over at his grandfather's place in kentucky he said i was up there and he said about midnight that night there come a knock on my door and there that drunk came up there knocking on that door and he said brother branham you're about to remember brother brown i just had the most terrible dream and brother the brother begins to describe to him that's what the dream was and he begins to describe to him he said there he said i dreamed i was a rabbit he said i was out there and he said i was just eating in that field eating the finest clover and he said i was just having a big old time and he said all of a sudden i heard the ball of a hound come across a hill and he said i heard it and he said i begin to run with everything that is within me he said i run and he said i could feel the hot breath of that hound running me down he said running me down he said but notice what he said he said i turned aside to see he said because i'd heard about a rock he said i heard about a rock and on the inside of that rock was a hole have you ever heard about a rock you may be running with everything that's within you but if you've heard about a rock oh if you've heard about iraq let me tell you something that brother said he said i'd heard he said i heard about that rock and i heard there was a hole in it he said if i knew that if i could get to that hole i'd be all right he said i was running and he said i knew that just at any second that he was going to gobble me up he said but all of a sudden he said i pounced into that hole he said then i let off the pressure oh let me tell you the bible said in psalms 46 that our god is our refuge and our strength in times of trouble when the seas are roaring about us when troubles are going on about us there is a place of refuge your refuge your refuge your city of refuge is no other place but the name of jesus christ it is a strong tower and you young girls might be sitting here guilty of all kinds of things you young boys could be sitting here guilty of all kinds of calamities of life and the hounds of hell might be chasing you down they might be chasing you down going after you as hard as you can go and you might be guilty of it all can i give you a prophet's word if you're guilty ask him to forgive you ask him to forgive you i'd say that if we'd sit here and say well this brother did this or that brother did that this sister did this committed this act or done this act i'd say there's some people that would quickly grab a rock but i want to be the voice of jesus woman where's your accusers at you might be guilty of everything that the law has said about you you might be guilty of doing all kinds of different acts i'm only preaching this because he's laid this on my heart for two weeks he's laid this on my heart he woke me up early this morning with a dream to give you this if you're guilty ask him to forgive you a prophet's words and he will take you back hallelujah and he will take you back he said it'll create in you a thirst that you can't go no further without finding that water broke and the hounds of hell might be chasing you but ask and you shall be forgiven the spirit of the lord dropped in my house last night and i saw a man running with everything that was within him he was running from the law when he was running from his critics he was running with everything was within him and the voice of the critic was hollering out i'm going to get you i'm going to get you i'm going to get you i'm going to get you you might be running with everything that is within you and the hounds of hell might be chasing after you and you may have done all kinds of ungodly things but there's a voice that's crying out repent repent and i'll take you back the judgment of the law would have cursed you and you went to a devil's hell but mercy came running after you it was mercy that rewrote your life it was mercy that saved you it was mercy that broke you out of that prison you can run all you want to and you can chase us all you want to hell but there is a way [Applause] i thought brother wayne did such a spectacular job on that trap every single one of us sat here in all we sat here in all we watched the raccoon get trapped and we watched a real trapper tell us how to set a trap you know brother branham said he said that the devil's got a trap setting for you he said the devil's got a trap setting for you there's a trap setting for you he said but all you have to do is say lord i'm sorry the one that studied your pattern the one that had hunted you down and the one that had chased you down he'd hunted you and he locked you he looked at you locked in a path locked in your pattern said they're going to come this way but brother branham said repentance gets you out of that trap there were men that stood there on the inauguration day when peter come out of that upper room and he was staggering under the influence of the holy ghost what realm was he influenced by he was influenced by a realm and there he gave the inauguration sermon on that day and there were men that walked out and they criticized him made fun of him but when peter got down to it and he was preaching christ crucified and christ resurrected and he come to it and he said this judgment will be upon you notice the reaction that was caused by the word the bible said in acts 2 and 37 men and brethren what shall we do notice these were the same words that paul said in acts 9 what what does thou ask me to do jesus notice how quickly their language changed when they recognized by the preaching of the word that they were wrong men and brethren what shall we do to escape this judgment then peter said unto thee unto them repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off and it might look like your children are afar off but there is power in repentance brother brandon said that no man is ever in a condition to receive the word only by the grounds of repentance you cannot receive the holy ghost without repentance you cannot live a godly life without repentance you cannot live an overcoming life without repentance but i'll say this to you every devil in hell can set a trap against the bride of jesus christ but there is a way to get us out of this mess there's a way to get you out of your troubles but i'm afraid i'll send away my day of grace get back up repent of it then this this ain't a negative sermon it's a positive sermon you might be taking a negativity and it might be burning you high just a little bit but this is a positive sermon you know that brother banham said brother branham said that the sins of god that the sins of the people would be visited the generations up to three to four generations he said you look upon you he said your mammy your grandmommy was a flapper girl and your mama was an old curse course girl and he said that's why you're striptease today he said because the bible said that i will visit the iniquity upon the people upon them for three to four generations he said don't you see what you're doing now your children will be judged for now this is positive too you can take it as negative but this is positive too he said oh brother he said how much more on that side if we do that much things in the wrong how much more is it visited unto us if we do the right thing you shall reap what you sow let me sow some good seeds of the baptism of the holy ghost let me sow seeds of mercy let me sow seeds of grace let me sow cease for more and more and more of god oh i'd say this christ is worth living for it's a positive thing it's brother andrew i don't want that kind of preaching in my home i don't want that kind of atmosphere i don't want that i don't want that kind of pressure on my family let me tell you this there will come a time in your life when you want me there's going to come a time in your life when you want me to preach this there's going to come a time maybe in your daughter's life when she's got pregnant by some scoundrel out there on the street that you wished you to listen to my voice you wished i'd have preached it a little bit harder and you bring them to me and say brother answer fix them for me i'm sorry i can't fix what i didn't break let me preach to you the greatest fixing power that there is mamas and daddies don't be degenerated people be resurrected people repent show your children what it's like show your children what it's like to live a godly life to say god i ain't live the best life i ain't done all the right things in life i made the best choices in life but god i'm sorry ah brother andrea don't apply to me give it 15 years each generation is 10 times worse it's hard to believe i've been out i've been out of high school 17 years i'm old not as old as some of y'all but i'm old i ain't got dinosaur breath like some of you but i'm old but you imagine you're killing me you're killing me that's great you imagine what i faced in 2005 when i was graduating it wasn't hardly a homosexual or lesbian case in all the school i went to these brothers just high school graduation this year and about threw up sitting right there it ain't no wonder why god spewed the church out of his mouth in this generation the wicked generation that we're living in you better hope that i keep preaching the way i'm preaching it's the only way that we're going to get out of this mess is to preach the same message that paul preached that peter preached and brother barum stood on that side he said well i preached the same thing paul preached i've said preach the same thing peter preached if peter's there i'll be there and if i'm gonna make it let me preach what paul preached let me preach what william branham preached let me preach the inauguration passage repent and be baptized hallelujah it's the quickening power of the holy ghost that'll get you in rapture and condition let the quickening power of almighty god feel these young people fill our lives god we're sorry god we've sinned god we've done wrong but god feel me let me come on those sacred grounds with you father let me come on those grounds with you father it's the only way that you're going to receive it's the only way you're going to receive is to repent repent or perish let me come on those grounds lord faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god how shall you hear without a preacher don't muzzle the ox don't shut down the preaching of the word don't shut it down you need live sermons like never before need preaching the bible tells us he's the high priest of our confession is that right it's time that you turn your mouth loose to some confessions lord you're my healer lord you're my savior lord you're my deliverer lord you're my healer you're my waymaker it's time that you start putting the word of god on your mouth that the bible tells us in romans 10 that the word of god is nigh thee even in thy mouth young christians old christians alike fill your mouth with the very word of god and repent of your sins and confess that he's your savior don't be ashamed to confess him before men because if you're ashamed to confess me before men i'll be ashamed to confess you before my father i was that one i was that one that got caught in a thicket out there i was that one that couldn't find my way back but when the shepherd came looking for me he threw me over his shoulders not with regret not with sorrow but with rejoicing this is your positive right here i'm that one brother answer i'm the one that was chased i'm the one that was run after let me tell you it was the name of jesus christ that stopped the mamba how was that one the name of jesus christ is stronger than a snakebite the name of jesus christ is stronger than the curse of sin the name of jesus christ is worse is stronger than the worst of enemies and when the shepherd brought the one back in what did he do brother nathan he gathered all the community he gathered all of his friends he gathered all of his folks that he loved everybody that knew his business this is the father's business what do you say rejoice with me rejoice rejoice with me rejoice of me i got 10 000 more scriptures i could give you on repentance but the bible said in luke 15 that the angels rejoice in heaven over one sinner that repenteth but let me preach to you another side of things just for a moment can you imagine hell can you imagine hell if all of heaven is rejoicing over one sinner that's repenting can you imagine hell hey what's going on may day mayday we lost another one we lost another one we lost another one i say may day be down in hell let the children of god return back and let us kill the fatted calf hell you've lost another one you lost this cancer battle you lost this sugar battle you lost this disease battle you will lose this laodicea flu battle and we will be raptured in the morning in a twinkling of an eye hell you lost another one now do you remember god bless you let's stand hallelujah somebody giving praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah why don't you call on the name of the lord right there where you are why don't you confess his name before before there is no more time why don't you stand there in your liberty and begin to confess with your mouth and give him honor give him glory why don't you say god i'm i'm sorry god i've been wrong in my life and in the morning when i rise give me jesus oh god here i am here i am oh god and i confess you before men and i confess you before your face oh what grace that was extended my way father let the redeemed of the lord rejoice in the promises of god lift your
