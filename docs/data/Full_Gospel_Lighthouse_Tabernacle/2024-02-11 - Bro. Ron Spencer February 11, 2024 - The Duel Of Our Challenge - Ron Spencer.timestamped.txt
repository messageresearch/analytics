[49:01] amen
[49:08] amen

[49:12] like to speak to you
[49:15] on the
[49:16] Duel of our
[49:19] challenge
[49:22] amen Revelations CH 12 and verse
[49:27] 7 and there was war in
[49:30] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[49:33] against the
[49:34] dragon and the dragon fought against and
[49:37] his
[49:38] angels and Prevail not neither was there
[49:44] Place found anymore in
[49:46] heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out
[49:50] the old serpent called the devil and
[49:53] Satan which deceiveth the whole world
[49:55] world and he was cast into the Earth and
[49:59] his angels were cast out with him and I
[50:02] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[50:05] has come salvation and strength and the
[50:08] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[50:12] Christ for the accuser of our Brethren
[50:15] is cast down which accused them before
[50:19] our God day and
[50:22] night and they overcame him
[50:26] by the blood of the lamb and by the word
[50:28] of their
[50:29] testimony and they love not their lives
[50:33] unto the
[50:34] death Isaiah 54 and verse
[50:39] 16 very familiar portion of
[50:42] scripture
[50:43] behold I have created the Smith that
[50:47] bloweth the coals and the
[50:49] fire and bringeth forth an instrument
[50:51] for his work and I have created the
[50:55] waser to destroy now think about that
[50:59] God's reminding us I created your
[51:06] enemy and if he has a
[51:09] beginning he has an
[51:12] end if he has a beginning he has an end
[51:17] and the difference between him and
[51:21] us we were with
[51:24] God before there was even a
[51:31] beginning good way to start we
[51:36] win now I want you to read this next
[51:38] verse with me and I want you to mean it
[51:41] no weapon that is formed against thee
[51:44] shall prosper and every tongue that
[51:47] shall arise against thee in judgment
[51:49] Thou shalt
[51:51] condemn this is the heritage of the
[51:53] Servants of the Lord and their
[51:56] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[51:59] you may be
[52:02] seated
[52:04] amen would' like for you to remember us
[52:06] in prayer this week we will be at UVA
[52:08] Cancer Center on Monday Tuesday and
[52:12] Wednesday uh lot of decisions to be made
[52:15] thank you brother Matthew I believe you
[52:17] read my
[52:19] mind and so and so there's a lot of
[52:22] decisions that are to be looked at and
[52:24] to be made made they'll be looking first
[52:27] of all we have a surgery on Tuesday and
[52:30] that is to remove a blood clot uh
[52:33] apparatus that is there to take it out
[52:36] and may have to put one back in then on
[52:39] Wednesday we start very early in the
[52:41] morning and start having MRIs and scans
[52:44] and then we will see most all the cancer
[52:46] team and uh that's from my torso to my
[52:50] brain and then and then we should know
[52:52] something toward the end of the day uh
[52:55] maybe late late Wednesday evening and so
[52:59] and so these are very uh important dates
[53:02] if you will remember us in prayer as we
[53:03] go through it as human beings we always
[53:06] have a little anxiety uh of what we
[53:09] could be facing or what we're going but
[53:10] we've already read the
[53:12] report that's what we believe and we we
[53:15] know that we're the winner either way
[53:17] and so remember Sister Connie uh Miss
[53:20] Ally is at home sick today and so sister
[53:23] Connie is watching over her
[53:28] amen when I was a little
[53:32] boy I I don't know maybe maybe probably
[53:35] none of you ever watched a guy named gun
[53:38] from
[53:41] Gunsmoke and he would walk right out in
[53:43] the middle of the of the
[53:47] street and as I watched him I watched
[53:51] him for years forgive
[53:54] me
[53:57] he never
[53:59] lost he never lost he had a limp and was
[54:02] a fake limp but he had a limp and and uh
[54:06] he was a big guy and always wor he's had
[54:09] a certain way and you know as I grew up
[54:11] I wanted to be a
[54:13] cowboy but as As Time elapsed I realized
[54:16] I was too
[54:20] short I was just too
[54:22] short and uh
[54:25] I I realized I wasn't going to get to do
[54:27] that and
[54:29] so and and I always remembered that you
[54:33] know you know sometimes you know the
[54:35] music would begin to play and it would
[54:37] it would get to be you know kind of a
[54:39] panic-like pace and you know and you
[54:42] knew all along he's going to win
[54:45] am I mean you could almost read the
[54:47] script uh he's going to win uh uh
[54:52] Matthew Dylan is he's going to win and
[54:54] but your heart was
[54:56] racing mine
[54:59] was and you know it kind of almost gave
[55:02] you a little bit of a fever pitch that
[55:04] your your heart was racing and you know
[55:07] then after you know that was an hour
[55:09] show and so then after you get toward
[55:11] that 50 55 minutes that's where the
[55:14] fight takes place and and you know at
[55:16] the end of the 55 minutes and the 56
[55:18] right through there they're they're
[55:20] enjoying the accolades of Victory and
[55:23] and you're sitting there go go want to
[55:24] give he W again well you knew
[55:35] that now I told you that story and and
[55:40] here we've been Christian some of you
[55:41] are brand new never heard me before
[55:43] preach and some of you are been here
[55:47] forever and yet Satan can make you feel
[55:50] like in a
[55:52] trial the music is bumping in
[55:56] and you feel so anxious as you come to
[55:57] certain spots in your life and and
[55:59] you're going through job situation
[56:01] marriage situation children situations
[56:04] and all different kinds of things and
[56:06] Doctor reports and all that and the
[56:08] music
[56:11] is and listen in the 56th minute you
[56:15] know you're going to
[56:23] win
[56:28] relax Amen Let me give you let me give
[56:32] you some real good news you
[56:40] win tell your neighbor we
[56:46] win now if I could think about it if we
[56:49] were a we were a
[56:51] uh we were a Fight Pro promoter
[56:57] and we were a guy that was in charge of
[57:01] literally billions of dollars to get the
[57:04] best heavyweight weight fight that you
[57:07] could get to put it
[57:10] together and you had Muhammad Ali on one
[57:13] side of the
[57:15] card and the other side you get a
[57:18] six-year-old
[57:22] kid nobody's coming
[57:26] nobody's coming so you get a George
[57:29] Foreman
[57:30] or or a
[57:32] Frasier or you you boy that sounded good
[57:35] didn't
[57:36] it or you get you get a a man that is up
[57:41] for the
[57:42] challenge now they're going to spend
[57:44] months to
[57:46] prepare and they begin to you know the
[57:48] music is playing and nobody really knows
[57:51] who's going to win
[57:53] here you and and literally
[57:56] incredible they begin to bet and they
[57:58] begin to do a lot of things who wins who
[58:00] wins who wins and and in a second it can
[58:03] be
[58:05] over in a second it can just be over and
[58:08] it's
[58:08] done now I want to just draw your
[58:12] thoughts just for a few
[58:13] minutes God knows he's going to
[58:18] win so when he's creating an
[58:21] enemy to literally share with us what
[58:24] redemp is all about and overcoming is
[58:27] all about he creates an
[58:31] enemy that that enemy has to believe
[58:34] he's going to
[58:37] win and he's fought in heaven he's been
[58:40] cast into the Earth and here we've got
[58:42] thousands of years that he's fought our
[58:44] brothers and sisters all the way through
[58:47] the
[58:48] scriptures and in God's predestinated
[58:51] plan he he chooses who will live in
[58:54] certain days and let's just say it who's
[58:58] going to be my
[59:01] Overcomer who's going to be my Overcomer
[59:04] I I'll take
[59:06] Noah I I'll take
[59:09] Abraham I I'll take this and no matter
[59:13] how formidable their enemy
[59:17] was they
[59:22] won are you with me now
[59:25] now I I I want you to notice that all
[59:28] the way down through they've had to meet
[59:30] the challenges of the hour now if you
[59:34] were Noah and the door is shut and now
[59:38] people are laughing and making fun you
[59:41] know that you didn't shut the door you
[59:43] built the ark according to the speck of
[59:46] God you preached the message you know
[59:49] you know in a few days you don't know
[59:51] when you're not in control it's up to
[59:53] God that's right and you know in a few
[59:55] days God's going to wash the Earth yes

[1:00:01] of God you've got friends you've got
[1:00:04] people out there that has been close to
[1:00:06] you and they're making fun they're
[1:00:08] hanging around just in
[1:00:12] case God didn't put a door down to where
[1:00:15] he could he himself could open it put a
[1:00:18] little bitty window in a
[1:00:21] spot and you know the sun came up the
[1:00:23] next day and the sun came up the next
[1:00:25] day and the sun came up the next day you

[1:00:40] box and he's Waring in your minds but
[1:00:43] let me just say
[1:00:45] this when the heavens turn
[1:00:51] black when the heavens turn black and
[1:00:54] the rain that had never
[1:00:56] fell and the Billows of the deep opened
[1:01:02] up everybody became a
[1:01:05] Believer everybody wanted to be on the
[1:01:08] ark but the message had put them in
[1:01:14] position are you with me God puts us in
[1:01:17] a strain to allow us to feel that
[1:01:20] pressure and that
[1:01:23] intensity
[1:01:25] even knowing that we
[1:01:27] win the devil Whispers In Your Ear well

[1:01:38] all of this pressure that's going on and
[1:01:41] there's nothing happening
[1:01:44] really the message has put us in the
[1:01:47] right
[1:01:49] spot listen when you can't see anything
[1:01:52] happening it's happening
[1:01:55] when you don't feel nothing moving it's
[1:01:58] moving when you don't feel nothing

[1:02:03] falling apart we
[1:02:06] [Applause]
[1:02:13] win Goliath screaming he didn't realize
[1:02:16] he only had days to
[1:02:18] live he had came to a spot to
[1:02:21] challenge God's people even in their
[1:02:25] back sliding unable to meet the
[1:02:27] challenge of the
[1:02:30] hour here come a
[1:02:34] boy a
[1:02:36] boy that was ready to meet the
[1:02:40] challenge listen is Israel's going to
[1:02:43] win they just don't know
[1:02:45] how they're going to win over that don't
[1:02:48] get all tore all the pieces as they're
[1:02:50] going to
[1:02:51] win the whole world is gathered against
[1:02:54] him but they're going to
[1:02:57] win brother Goliath don't know it's
[1:03:00] going to be his last
[1:03:03] day but God prepared a
[1:03:09] hero he prepared a boy that would be
[1:03:16] king that would create the Throne of
[1:03:19] David listen God had big plans for for
[1:03:24] this boy I'd like to remind you God has
[1:03:28] big plans for
[1:03:30] you look past your troubles look past
[1:03:34] your Sorrows look past your
[1:03:37] anxieties God placed a potential on the
[1:03:40] inside of you to overcome in this
[1:03:43] realm but not just this realm God's got
[1:03:46] plans he's got a marriage
[1:03:49] supper he's got a millennium period he's
[1:03:53] got eternity
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:56] to spin with
[1:04:01] you imagine how great God's plans
[1:04:08] are we're living in Satan's
[1:04:11] Eden I think about how God that created
[1:04:14] the heavens and the Earth and he said
[1:04:16] let there be right God spoke the world
[1:04:19] into existence
[1:04:21] it and for thousands of years
[1:04:25] all of these great minds didn't know
[1:04:27] that there was coal in the
[1:04:30] earth they didn't know there was natural
[1:04:33] the natural gas in the earth they didn't
[1:04:37] know all of these elements were in the
[1:04:39] earth inside of the earth until this day
[1:04:45] amen they rode by
[1:04:48] horseback by whatever that they could go
[1:04:51] by but in this day
[1:04:55] we have created
[1:04:57] cars that can fly down the road amen
[1:05:01] sometimes you're driving at 70 miles an
[1:05:03] hour and somebody goes by
[1:05:04] you that's
[1:05:07] right you get on a
[1:05:11] plane I'm not getting on a
[1:05:15] rocket and you think all of that came
[1:05:19] with from within the Earth that God
[1:05:23] created
[1:05:25] it I'm fishing for you
[1:05:27] now you just cannot realize the
[1:05:31] potential that God placed in
[1:05:36] you you cannot real you just sometimes
[1:05:39] see this out
[1:05:41] facade but you just cannot realize how
[1:05:46] powerful the word of God is that he
[1:05:49] placed on the inside of
[1:05:52] you Kings and priest and Overcomers
[1:05:55] ladies of Grace Queens Of Heaven in me
[1:06:00] brother Ron absolutely on the inside of
[1:06:02] you God placed his diamonds on the
[1:06:06] inside of
[1:06:15] you well brother Ron I don't know all
[1:06:17] about that well have you ever listened
[1:06:20] to the fellow that Whispers in your ear
[1:06:22] and he tells you you're nothing and you
[1:06:23] know you or something right he tells you
[1:06:27] you'll never make it and you know what
[1:06:29] the book says about you he tells you
[1:06:31] you're sick and you're going to die and
[1:06:33] then you believe God at his report
[1:06:36] regardless of what the doctors
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:40] say how you know that brother Ron I'll
[1:06:42] be preaching for you next
[1:06:45] Sunday that's just an example for
[1:06:48] you that's an example for
[1:06:53] you
[1:06:54] I'm not believing that when they run the
[1:06:56] MRI that I'm going to have more brain
[1:06:58] tumors and they're going to have to
[1:06:59] operate on me immediately I'm I'm not
[1:07:01] going to even go
[1:07:03] there I believe I'm already working on
[1:07:06] next week's sermon
[1:07:10] so that's what we do that's what we

[1:10:14] 29 he giveth power to the

[1:10:20] might he increases
[1:10:26] strength so my words to you this morning
[1:10:29] is don't forget where your source of
[1:10:32] strength
[1:10:34] is I find it absolutely amazing when you
[1:10:37] get in the heat of a trial or the heat
[1:10:39] of the thing the devil will tell you
[1:10:41] don't go to
[1:10:44] church and it tell you them people don't
[1:10:47] love you you just lay out you just lay
[1:10:49] out you just lay out you know what
[1:10:51] you'll
[1:10:52] do you'll so
[1:10:57] backslide but when you come to church
[1:10:59] and all of a sudden somebody turns
[1:11:00] around and tells you you just don't know
[1:11:02] how much I love
[1:11:06] you and then they just blast the devil's
[1:11:09] thoughts out all week long somebody
[1:11:12] walks up and hugs you and say we're just
[1:11:13] glad to see you in the house of the Lord
[1:11:16] they do not realize the devil has wored
[1:11:20] all week long with that person and you
[1:11:23] by the power of the word of the Lord
[1:11:26] speak strength to
[1:11:33] them
[1:11:35] bo
[1:11:38] [Applause]
[1:11:44] boo brother BR says everything had to
[1:11:47] know that he'd
[1:11:48] conquered when he shut the door on them
[1:11:51] and the days of mercies was passing on
[1:11:53] on down through the lowest pits of hell
[1:11:55] he went and he knocked at the city doors
[1:11:58] of the devil's hell you talking about a
[1:12:01] duel and the Devil comes to the door and
[1:12:05] as we could look to see and there he
[1:12:08] there he said well here you are after
[1:12:10] all I thought I had you when I killed
[1:12:13] the prophets I was sure that I had you
[1:12:15] when I cut John's head off in prison but
[1:12:18] now after all you're
[1:12:19] here and I can hear him say as he
[1:12:22] straightened himself up and said
[1:12:25] Satan I'm the Virgin born son of the
[1:12:28] Living God my blood is still wet on the
[1:12:31] cross I paid the price I've conquered
[1:12:35] and I've come down here to take
[1:12:41] over strip you of everything that you
[1:12:45] claimed that you had and he reached over
[1:12:48] on his side and jerked those keys of
[1:12:50] death and hell off of him and kicked him
[1:12:52] back into the place place where he
[1:12:54] belonged he conquered hell and when he
[1:12:57] arose he had the keys of death hell
[1:13:01] hanging on his side so what's the church
[1:13:04] scared about
[1:13:06] then he conquered Satan he conquered
[1:13:09] sickness he conquered death he conquered
[1:13:15] hell I want you to say this with me
[1:13:18] what's the church scared about then chur
[1:13:22] scared let's say it a different way why
[1:13:25] am I
[1:13:26] scared I scared he conquered
[1:13:31] Satan he conquered
[1:13:34] sickness he conquered
[1:13:37] death he conquered
[1:13:40] hell let's say it again like we really
[1:13:42] meant it he conquered
[1:13:45] hell Give the Lord a good hand right
[1:13:52] there
[1:13:56] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 finally
[1:13:59] my brethren be strong in the Lord and in
[1:14:02] the power of His might and put on the
[1:14:03] whole armor of God that ye may be able
[1:14:05] to stand against the Ws of the
[1:14:09] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:14:12] and blood but against principalities
[1:14:14] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:14:15] darkness of this world and against
[1:14:17] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:14:20] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:14:22] of God that you may be able to withstand
[1:14:24] in the evil day and having to done all
[1:14:26] to stand stand therefore having your
[1:14:29] loins GED about with truth and having on
[1:14:30] the breastplate of righteousness and
[1:14:32] your feet shot with the preparation of
[1:14:34] the gospel of peace above all taken the
[1:14:37] shield of Faith wherewith you may be
[1:14:39] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:14:41] the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:14:43] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:14:45] which is the word of God praying
[1:14:50] always let's read this verse together
[1:14:52] praying always with all prayer and
[1:14:56] supplication in the spirit and watching
[1:14:59] there un with all perseverance and
[1:15:01] supplication for All
[1:15:05] Saints can can you say this I am a Son
[1:15:08] of God I am a daughter of
[1:15:12] God I came from God and I'm going to go
[1:15:15] back to

[1:15:20] in now I want to talk to you about
[1:15:22] prayer the things that we
[1:15:24] do brother random said the only way that
[1:15:27] I know to do is prayer prayer is the key
[1:15:31] that's the
[1:15:32] answer say brother but I got a lot of
[1:15:35] questions prayer is your
[1:15:37] answer Prayer Changes Things prayer is
[1:15:41] the most powerful weapon that was ever
[1:15:43] put in the control of human beings

[1:15:50] atomic bomb or no hydrogen bomb as
[1:15:56] powerful as
[1:16:03] prayer then when your enemy is wiring
[1:16:06] you out during the day he will do his
[1:16:09] best to keep
[1:16:17] you
[1:16:22] from
[1:16:25] when Andrew got in

[1:16:49] it if Andrew could do that come on
[1:16:54] don't you re I'm not advocating fighting

[1:17:40] road we have an incredible message it
[1:17:43] can't get
[1:17:44] better this message can't get
[1:17:47] better God gave us the greatest message
[1:17:50] on the Earth but now we want it more

[1:18:31] now that little Prophet the message
[1:18:34] delivered don't get mad what brother
[1:18:36] Andrew said last night brother brandham
[1:18:39] did the message and the Lord took him
[1:18:41] home he's not coming back to repr preach

[1:20:07] the cancer that I'm
[1:20:09] baren what a silly statement that would
[1:20:12] be when I think that God said let there

[1:20:16] son and when there was no son he spoke
[1:20:19] it into existence he believed his own
[1:20:22] word
