[23:27] mighty God?
[23:30] But Lord, as we heard [music] from
[23:31] Brother William last night,
[23:35] Father, that you become sin to die for
[23:38] us.
[23:41] But Lord, it wouldn't do [music] no good
[23:42] for you just to die if you didn't rise
[23:44] again.
[23:47] And Father, there's needs. There's
[23:49] children here. Lord, I just sit in my

[33:22] on some past me.
[33:28] Cuz he's the same [music and singing]
[33:29] God
[33:31] who's living
[33:33] in me.
[33:39] The same God
[33:42] who [music] spoke to
[33:45] the woman he hath
[33:48] the well
[33:50] the [music] same God
[33:53] who [singing] wonders
[33:56] too [music] many
[33:58] to tell
[34:01] the same God [singing]
[34:04] who parted [music]
[34:07] the [singing] raing
[34:09] Red and [music] sea.
[34:11] Yes, he's the same [singing] God
[34:15] who's living
[34:17] in me.
[34:23] Bless the same God
[34:26] who created
[34:29] all the heavens [singing]
[34:31] and all [music] the earth
[34:34] who came back living in Jesus.
[34:39] And there is power
[34:42] in his word. [music]
[34:45] But now in
[34:48] these [singing] last days,
[34:51] I'm beginning
[34:53] to see that he's the same God
[34:59] [music] who's living
[35:01] in me.
[35:07] Oh, the same God [music and singing]
[35:10] who spoke to you.
[35:13] So, it has [music]
[35:16] the well.
[35:18] The same God [music and singing]
[35:21] whose wonders,
[35:24] too many
[35:26] to tell.
[35:30] The same God [singing]
[35:32] who parted
[35:35] the ra
[35:40] is he's the same God [singing]
[35:43] who's living
[35:46] here in me.
[35:50] Oh,
[35:52] the same God [singing]
[35:54] who spoke to you. [music]
[35:57] Oh, in heaven
[36:00] the world.
[36:02] The same [singing] God
[36:05] whose wonders [music]
[36:08] too many
[36:10] to tell.
[36:13] Oh, [singing] he's the same God
[36:16] who parted
[36:19] the raging
[36:21] red sea.
[36:24] Yes, [singing] he's the same God
[36:27] who's been living
[36:30] in me. [music]
[36:35] Oh, he's the same God
[36:38] who's living [music and singing]
[36:41] in me.
[36:58] And we thankful that the same one that
[36:59] parted that Red Sea.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; He's actually standing in this building
[37:03] with us today.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; If our eyes would just be unveiled to
[37:06] know that he's standing right in here
[37:07] with us. The same one that was with
[37:09] brother Brandham. He's still here with
[37:11] this message today.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever need we have, if we just reach
[37:15] out and touch the hymn of his garment
[37:17] this morning.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; He's more than able. He's willing.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; He wants to know, are we willing to
[37:22] reach out and touch him?
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:26] My my. Let's give him another hand clap
[37:28] of praise. [applause]
[37:30] May we stand this morning as we prepare
[37:33] to
[37:35] invite brother Matt out to bring us the
[37:37] word of life. Didn't brother William do
[37:39] a wonderful job last night. I tell you
[37:43] [applause]
[37:46] a wonderful gift the Lord's put in your
[37:48] life. Brother William,
[37:50] &gt;&gt; we appreciate it.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Has the dear.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Let's just open our hearts to him.

[39:05] desire [music and singing]

[40:42] or silver. Only you [music] can satisfy.
[40:48] [singing]
[40:55] You alone
[40:58] are the real
[41:01] joy giver in the act [music] who love
[41:08] my eyes.

[41:53] Amen.
[41:56] More [singing]
[41:57] of you.
[42:02] More of [singing] you. [music]
[42:08] I've had it all.
[42:11] What I need now is more [singing]
[42:16] of you.
[42:22] of things [singing]
[42:24] I've had
[42:26] my fear
[42:29] [music]
[42:30] and yet I hunger
[42:34] still
[42:37] [music]
[42:38] empty [singing]
[42:39] and bare.
[42:42] Lord hear my prayer
[42:45] for more of you.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; [music]
[42:53] &gt;&gt; I need [singing] more
[42:56] of you.
[43:01] Bless you. [music] More

[43:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[43:16] &gt;&gt; But what I need
[43:19] is more [music] of
[43:23] Oh, can you say that one more time? More
[43:25] of you.
[43:28] Oh, more [music]
[43:30] of you.
[43:34] Yeah.
[43:37] more
[43:39] of you.
[43:48] [music]
[43:51] But what I need
[43:55] is more
[43:57] of you.
[44:01] Amen. Is that your desire this morning?
[44:02] [music] Just more of the Lord Jesus
[44:05] Christ. Good to be in the house, Lord,
[44:07] isn't it? Let me sing a song. Pressing
[44:09] on, pressing on.
[44:12] [music]
[44:13] Oh, pressing [singing] on,

[44:40] Well, I'm going [music] to keep
[44:42] pressing. [singing]

[44:59] on
[45:00] into the higher calling [music]
[45:04] of high.
[45:11] [music]
[45:12] Oh, now Satan tries to stop me
[45:16] and turn me aside. [singing]
[45:20] He says there's no need [music] for you
[45:22] to go home [singing]
[45:24] and no need to try.
[45:28] And even if there was a rapture, you
[45:32] never make [music] it in.
[45:36] Well, I just say Satan. Oh, that proves
[45:40] you again. [music]
[45:42] I'm going to keep pressing.
[45:45] Oh,
[45:48] on and on and [music and singing] on.
[45:50] I'm going to keep pressing.
[45:53] Oh,
[45:55] [music]
[45:57] oh, I'm going to keep pressing
[46:01] on [music]
[46:02] onto the higher [singing] call.
[46:07] Oh, let's sing that verse again. Satan
[46:09] tries to stop you.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; [music]
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, now Satan tries [music] to stop me
[46:19] and turn me aside.
[46:23] He says there's no need for [music] you
[46:25] to go home and no need [singing] to try.
[46:31] And even if there [singing] was a
[46:33] rapture, you never make [music] it in.
[46:39] Well, I just say Satan. [music]
[46:42] Oh, that proves you lying.
[46:45] I'm going to keep pressing.
[46:48] Oh,
[46:51] on and on and on. [music and singing]
[46:53] I'm going to keep pressing.
[46:56] Oh.
[47:01] Oh, I'm going to keep pressing
[47:03] [music and singing]
[47:04] on
[47:06] to the high [music] call.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your testimony this
[47:16] morning?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; No matter what Satan tries to tell me,
[47:20] &gt;&gt; I'm pressing on. [singing]
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good to be in the house of the
[47:23] Lord this morning, isn't it?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, musicians. God richly bless
[47:27] you. I just want to make announcement
[47:30] here. Sister Amy Battton had gotten some
[47:33] chairs from the fall fellowship. That
[47:35] was someone else's. I think some blue
[47:37] chairs, lawn chairs, they are in the
[47:40] church fellowship hall. If you have lost
[47:42] your chairs, and they're your blue and
[47:46] those are yours. You can go get those
[47:48] after service. And glad to have each and
[47:51] every one of our visitors here with us
[47:52] this morning. Glad to have brother John,
[47:54] sister Kimberly Weeks here with us. God
[47:56] bless you, Sister Debbie. And then all
[47:59] the other ones that usually try to leave
[48:01] when I I go to preach.
[48:04] Thank you, Sister Mary, for being here.
[48:09] I'm just giving her a hard time. Usually
[48:11] happens that usually when they're gone
[48:13] away and I preach, they're not here, you
[48:14] know. So,
[48:17] I'm glad to have uh Sister Mary, Brother
[48:19] Chris here with us. I love them
[48:20] definitely. And each and every one of
[48:22] you. I love each and every one of you.
[48:24] want to continue to praying for dad and
[48:26] Andrew there that God will bless them
[48:28] and strengthen them. I think their their
[48:31] parts of the services are done and went
[48:33] well. So we want to pray for for God
[48:35] just restore their bodies, strengthen
[48:37] them. Brother Andrew will be uh flying
[48:39] home uh tomorrow. So we want to pray for
[48:42] their safe travels there and then u dad
[48:46] will be spending a little time with
[48:47] brother David Mayor. much needed rest.
[48:50] And so we we appreciate brother David
[48:52] taking care of uh our pastor, our our
[48:56] brother and my dad there. So I want to
[48:59] pray for them that God would just
[49:00] strengthen them
[49:03] this morning. I'd like to uh go to 2
[49:06] Corinthians 12 and 7. If you'd go there
[49:09] with me
[49:12] as you're turning there this morning,
[49:13] I'd like to take a uh a sermon title,
[49:16] Don't Mistake My Kindness for Weakness.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.
[49:27] 2 Corinthians 12 and:e 7 says, "And lest
[49:30] I should be exalted above measure
[49:33] through the abundance of revelations,
[49:36] there was given unto me a thorn in the
[49:38] flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet
[49:40] me, lest I should be exalted above
[49:43] measure. For this thing I besought the
[49:46] Lord thrice, that it might depart from
[49:49] me." And he said unto me, "My grace is
[49:53] sufficient for thee, for my strength is
[49:57] made perfect in weakness, and most
[50:00] gladly therefore
[50:03] will I rather glory in my infirmities,
[50:06] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[50:08] me. Therefore, I take pleasure in
[50:11] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[50:14] necessities, in persecutions, in
[50:16] distress for Christ's sake. For when I
[50:20] am weak, then I am strong.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just bow our heads at this
[50:26] moment. Just go to the word, Lord, in
[50:28] prayer. Our dear most heavenly father,
[50:31] Lord, we thank you for letting us be
[50:32] able to gather here this morning. Lord,
[50:35] be able to just uh join our little licks
[50:38] of fire, Lord, to just be a beacon of
[50:40] light to this dark age. Now God, I ask
[50:43] you that you'll just take these
[50:44] scriptures, lift them off the pages,
[50:47] Lord, and just go to our hearts this
[50:49] morning, God. Lord, we thank you for
[50:51] what you're doing, what you have done.
[50:53] Strengthen your people here this
[50:55] morning, Lord. Give us an ear to hear
[50:57] and a heart to receive. Jesus name.
[51:00] Amen. Amen. You can be seated this
[51:03] morning.
[51:05] I'd also like to read Luke 7 and verse
[51:08] 36.
[51:12] And one of the Pharisees desired him
[51:15] that he would eat with him. And he went
[51:18] to the Pharise unto the Pharisees house
[51:22] and sat down to meet.
[51:26] As I said, my title this morning is
[51:29] don't mistake my kindness for weakness.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; We live in a world that often mistakes
[51:34] kindness for weakness. Right.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; When Christians choose to walk away
[51:39] instead of fight back,
[51:41] &gt;&gt; people call you soft.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; When we forgive, they call us foolish.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; When you show mercy, they think it's
[51:48] because we're afraid.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; But the truth is, it takes more strength
[51:52] to stay gentle in harsh world
[51:55] &gt;&gt; than it does to strike back.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; So our kindness is not a sign of
[52:00] weakness.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It's an evidence of power under control.
[52:03] That's right.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; For the Lord said, "My strength is made
[52:08] perfect in weakness."
[52:10] &gt;&gt; That means what looks like weakness to
[52:13] the world is actually where God's
[52:15] strength shows up.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Paul looked weak, battling a thorn,
[52:20] struggling through pain, admitting
[52:22] limitation. But in truth, that weakness
[52:25] was where God's power rested the most.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I'd like to turn back to 2 Corinthians
[52:31] 12:9-10. I'd like to go through that
[52:33] again. And it says, "And he said unto
[52:36] me, my grace is sufficient for thee,
[52:42] for my strength is made perfect in
[52:43] weakness. Mo glad most gladly,
[52:45] therefore, I would rather glory in my
[52:48] infirmities,
[52:49] that the power of Christ may rest upon
[52:52] me. Therefore, I take pleasure in my
[52:54] infirmities, in reproaches, in
[52:56] necessities, in persecutions, in
[52:58] distress for Christ's sake. For when I
[53:01] am weak, then I am strong.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; See, Paul faced a thorn in the flesh.
[53:09] And many times we ourselves face thorns
[53:11] in our flesh,
[53:13] &gt;&gt; our own bodies, our minds, maybe, maybe
[53:16] even people that would come against us.
[53:18] Paul would say Satan a messenger that
[53:21] would buffet him.
[53:24] But in Galatians, we also see that Paul
[53:27] maybe had issues with his eyesight. For
[53:29] he said that you would have plucked out
[53:32] your own eyes and given them to me if
[53:33] you would have.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And then he said in another place, I
[53:36] wrote a large letter unto you. So we see
[53:39] here that Paul's infirmity, his thorn in
[53:41] the flesh, may have been his eyesight,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; but it didn't stop him.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; See, he asked three times of the Lord,
[53:49] Lord, won't you take this away from me?
[53:51] Amen.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Please, Lord, won't you just maybe move
[53:53] it on out of the side? But see, God
[53:56] didn't say, "My power, my healing, my
[53:59] deliverance." He said, "My grace."
[54:02] &gt;&gt; My grace.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Grace is not just an absence of
[54:06] struggle, but it's the presence of
[54:08] strength in the middle of it.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; He said is sufficient for thee. And we
[54:13] see sufficient means enough,
[54:16] &gt;&gt; complete, fully adequate.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God's grace is fully adequate
[54:23] for every situation that you're going to
[54:25] go through.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; See, Paul learned that God's grace
[54:28] provides and will always be greater than
[54:31] any pain life allows.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; So we know we may not get what we want.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; But we get what we need.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; It's usually as it would be a paradox.
[54:48] My strength is made perfect in weakness.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; That's a paradox. How are you strong in
[54:56] weakness?
[54:57] &gt;&gt; But it's God's strength living through
[54:59] us.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; So Paul had asked thrice, Lord, won't
[55:04] you just take this away from me?
[55:07] &gt;&gt; God said, nope. My grace is sufficient
[55:10] for thee. So Paul's next response is
[55:14] most gladly.
[55:16] Most gladly, therefore, will I rather
[55:18] glorify in my infirmities.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; So Paul shifted
[55:22] &gt;&gt; what he was asking for. Now it is
[55:24] &gt;&gt; he shifted it.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Most gladly will I take these
[55:28] infirmities.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Infirmities, physical weaknesses,
[55:32] reproaches, maybe insults of Satan,
[55:35] criticism, slander. We all face those
[55:38] things. That's right.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Necessities, seasons of need of lack or
[55:42] need of lack, persecutions,
[55:45] oppositions of doing right, distresses,
[55:49] inward pressures, anxieties,
[55:52] &gt;&gt; emotional strains.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Through all those things,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; what did Paul say? For when I am weak,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; when I am weak,
[56:05] &gt;&gt; then I am strong.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Won't you turn to your neighbor
[56:09] this morning and say, "For when I am
[56:10] weak,
[56:11] &gt;&gt; weak,
[56:12] &gt;&gt; then I am strong."
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Because God is on my side.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; See, being a Christian is not being a
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; See, the world wants panty waist
[56:25] preachers that want to comfort them and
[56:27] give them soft words and speak little
[56:29] things.
[56:30] [applause]
[56:34] You didn't come to hear no panty waist
[56:36] preacher this morning.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't come to comfort you. Don't
[56:41] mistake my kindness for weakness.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I tell that to the world, but I'm also
[56:47] telling that to Satan. And that's the
[56:49] same attitude I want you to have.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; World, you don't mistake my kindness for
[56:54] weakness.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Because they will use and abuse and they
[56:59] will take advantage of you. They will
[57:02] say, "Well, oh, you're a Christian. You
[57:04] shouldn't do that.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't strike back like that."
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you one thing. God
[57:10] didn't give us armor to hide behind.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; He did not give us armor to hide behind
[57:17] to just protect ourselves. He gave armor
[57:19] to you to fight.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "I will be with thee.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; I will go before thee."
[57:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. So in this war of the
[57:29] flesh, he's going to be with you.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Good.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; But being a Christian is not being a
[57:36] &gt;&gt; It takes strength to be patient.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; It takes love to face hate.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; It takes standing firm in faith when the
[57:43] world pushes you to compromise.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; It takes courage to forgive, bravery to
[57:49] stand true, and endurance to keep
[57:51] running a race.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Carrying a cross is no easy task.
[57:56] It's the ultimate act of strength.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Dad would tell me over and over again
[58:01] going through high school when when I
[58:03] was a little younger and I had a lot of
[58:06] people that like to pick on me. I really
[58:09] had a hard time with that. I was a much
[58:12] littleer guy then. People made fun of me
[58:15] for wearing glasses. People made fun of
[58:17] me for the way I acted. I wanted
[58:20] friends.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; I want it to be light. I think every
[58:24] single one of us can say that and say I
[58:26] want to be liked.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; But me doing that also showed them I was
[58:32] a kind person. So they would take and
[58:34] they would use that against me. So God,
[58:37] excuse me, dad had a statement for me.
[58:41] He said, "Tell you what, you take this
[58:43] Bible and you carry it with you to
[58:46] school.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; And you tell them sissies that want to
[58:49] pick on you, that think they're stronger
[58:50] than you, if you're such a man,
[58:53] &gt;&gt; you carry this."
[58:56] [applause]
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz it takes a real man to carry the
[59:00] word of God. [applause]
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Takes some real sisters to carry the
[59:05] word of God.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; So if the world thinks there's such that
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. carry this.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Carry this.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; It takes more to carry this than it does
[59:18] to make fun of people.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; But that's the way the world would want
[59:20] to do. They want to make fun of you,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:23] &gt;&gt; They want to take you for granted,
[59:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I I'm sure a lot of you have
[59:29] family members that is not Christians,
[59:31] but because you are a Christian, they
[59:35] will come to you in time of their needs.
[59:39] True.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; In time of their needs,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; and they will want you to go out of your
[59:44] way.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Because you're weak. You're a Christian.
[59:50] You're meek.
[59:51] I'm sorry. That's not who we are.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say, "In the
[59:59] backyard, us Brandoms,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; we we'd fight a little bit. We'd get in
[1:00:04] some tussles a little bit, but in the
[1:00:06] front yard,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. We stood together.
[1:00:09] [cheering]
[1:00:10] [applause]
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; We stood together.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; So, sometimes you might see me and I'll
[1:00:16] take brother me and brother Alen.
[1:00:18] We'll agree to disagree on ways things
[1:00:21] maybe should be
[1:00:23] in the backyard.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; But in the front yard,
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; if someone messes with any of you,
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; if somebody comes
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; to buffet any of you,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; we're standing in the front yard to meet
[1:00:36] them. Yes.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Because God has given us the power, the
[1:00:42] authority.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; We have Mark 16 in action.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; We're not sissies about taking the word
[1:00:49] of God and using it.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, Satan, don't mistake my kindness for
[1:00:54] weakness this morning.
[1:00:56] [applause and cheering]
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; We have a business partner that he
[1:00:59] started going to a church in the valley.
[1:01:01] And I won't say what church it is, but
[1:01:03] he started going because his wife wanted
[1:01:04] him to go there. And while they were
[1:01:06] there, they the pastor come to him and,
[1:01:08] you know, they wanted to, you know,
[1:01:10] teach them how to be lambs and just lay
[1:01:13] themselves down and be real.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And he come to us knowing dad real well.
[1:01:18] And he come to us and he said, "You
[1:01:20] know, this is what the pastor really
[1:01:22] wants." He said, "But I don't like it."
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why am I teaching my child to
[1:01:29] be just a wee little lamb to let anyone
[1:01:31] run over them?"
[1:01:33] I was thinking, we'll come to a church
[1:01:34] where we teach real sons and daughters
[1:01:37] of God to be soldiers of the cross.
[1:01:40] [cheering]
[1:01:42] [applause]
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; See, I'm on the battlefield for my Lord.
[1:01:48] [cheering]
[1:01:49] [applause]
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; I'm on the battlefield for my Lord.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; I want you to promise him the same way
[1:01:56] I've promised him. I want you to stand
[1:01:59] strong the say I same way I've told him
[1:02:01] I'm going to stand strong for him.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; He stood for each and every one of us.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Kindness for weakness. Quotes here. It
[1:02:08] says, "Kindness is a language which the
[1:02:11] deaf can hear and the blind can see."
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Mark Twain.
[1:02:17] Where I got my sermon from is don't
[1:02:20] mistake my kindness for weakness. I am
[1:02:24] kind to everyone. But when someone is
[1:02:27] unkind to me, weak is not what you are
[1:02:31] going to remember about me.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Alap Al Capone.
[1:02:38] [laughter]
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, that's that was
[1:02:42] a gangster. You're quoting a gangster."
[1:02:49] Well, our prophet preached thinking
[1:02:51] man's filter,
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; you know, got that off of a cigarette
[1:02:55] pack.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; So, I thought, why not?
[1:02:59] [applause]
[1:03:07] So, I'm going to repeat to you again. I
[1:03:10] am kind to everyone. A man that created
[1:03:14] soup kitchens in Chicago was kind to
[1:03:17] everyone. But when someone is unkind to
[1:03:20] me, weak is not what you're going to
[1:03:23] remember about me.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; We have brother Ruben back here. He just
[1:03:29] won the the strong man grip competition
[1:03:32] of the church.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; What was it? 190B grip.
[1:03:39] 197
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; 191
[1:03:43] 191 grip
[1:03:46] he gripped that thing.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; But you know in those same hands he's
[1:03:52] holding a baby this morning.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; In those same hands he'll rock Elliot to
[1:03:57] sleep.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; In those same hands he'll love Abigail.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; But with those same hands he'll protect
[1:04:05] his household.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. with those hanged hands,
[1:04:08] he'll go to work.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; So don't mistake his kindness
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; for weakness.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; He's a strong man.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Strongest in the church. I would have
[1:04:20] loved to have seen Brother Meadows back
[1:04:22] in his heyday grab a hold of that thing.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Jonathan might have needed two
[1:04:27] two of those things cuz he'd have broke
[1:04:28] that that one.
[1:04:32] He was a strong man.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:35] But when you mess with children of God,
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; They're there to protect you.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; They're go to battle for you.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's the same way with us. You mess
[1:04:49] with our family, our friends.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Our church,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; oh, you'll have a fight on your hands.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I've been called a yes man. That's
[1:05:01] farther than the truth than I've ever
[1:05:02] heard.
[1:05:04] I'm no yes man.
[1:05:09] So Luke 7 and36 and says and one of the
[1:05:12] Pharisees desired to him that he would
[1:05:14] eat with him and went to the Pharisees
[1:05:18] house and did sit down to meet.
[1:05:21] This word Pharisee as brother Brandon
[1:05:24] would say is an actor.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; An actor
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; he was putting on so to say. So this
[1:05:30] morning, I'd like to dramatize a little
[1:05:32] bit of this story with you of Luke 7. So
[1:05:36] we see the Pharisee and he's having a
[1:05:38] great feast
[1:05:41] and he says, you know, we need some
[1:05:44] entertainment. We need somebody to just
[1:05:47] kind of make us feel good about
[1:05:48] ourselves.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I've heard about this so-called preacher
[1:05:52] in the area, Jesus.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; I'd like for him to kind of come to our
[1:05:58] house. we'll kind of see what he's all
[1:06:00] about. So, I can see the Pharisee Simon
[1:06:04] go to his courier and say, "Listen, I
[1:06:06] want you to find this man. I don't care
[1:06:08] what it takes. I need you to have him
[1:06:10] here at this banquet that I'm having."
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; So, I can see the courier running days,
[1:06:16] whatever it may be, however long it
[1:06:18] might have taken in that age, running
[1:06:22] back and forth. And brother Brandham
[1:06:24] would say he was a type of a flunky
[1:06:27] because he was one of the lowest of the
[1:06:30] households. And so this this flunky,
[1:06:33] this courier was running back and forth
[1:06:35] trying to find, hey, have you heard of
[1:06:37] Jesus of Nazareth? Do you know where
[1:06:39] maybe he's at? Where can I find him at?
[1:06:40] I got to find him. Then he comes up on a
[1:06:42] crowd. And as brother William was
[1:06:44] speaking last night, maybe he was
[1:06:46] preaching his first doctrine. You must
[1:06:48] be born again.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Preach it. and he come up on this crowd
[1:06:52] and he he met Philillip or maybe Luke or
[1:06:55] one of the disciples there and he says,
[1:06:57] "Listen, I need to get to your master. I
[1:06:59] need to give him a message." And I could
[1:07:01] see maybe one of them say, "You're not
[1:07:03] getting to this. This this is Jesus. You
[1:07:06] you're just not just coming up." He
[1:07:08] said, "Well, I have a message from the
[1:07:10] Pharisee.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; I have a message from Simon the Pharisee
[1:07:14] that I need to get to Jesus." So, I
[1:07:17] could just imagine when he got to Peter
[1:07:19] and what Peter might have told him.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; But then Jesus heard that he was
[1:07:24] invited. And you know the thing about
[1:07:26] Jesus, he always comes to where he's
[1:07:29] invited.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; I don't care where it's at. If you
[1:07:33] invite him, he will come.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; So this Pharisee had invited him to come
[1:07:38] to meet. So here's Jesus after
[1:07:41] preaching. He's made these long travels
[1:07:44] and he's come to Simon's house
[1:07:48] and he sits and he's waiting and there
[1:07:51] is Simon and all of them looking upon
[1:07:55] Jesus
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; to make fun of Jesus
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; to make light of Jesus. See, brother
[1:08:04] Brandon would say that this Pharisee
[1:08:06] might have thought that he had a trump
[1:08:08] card up his sleeve. That he might have
[1:08:11] would have said, you know, the days of
[1:08:13] miracles are passed. You know, all them
[1:08:15] people that may have died, they didn't
[1:08:16] really die. Those people that he
[1:08:18] resurrected, they didn't really
[1:08:20] resurrect. You know, that's just he he's
[1:08:22] a mental telepathy. He's just a fortune
[1:08:24] teller. don't believe any of those
[1:08:27] things, but we're going to bring him
[1:08:29] here and we're going to make a light of
[1:08:31] this Jesus and see what all the noise is
[1:08:35] about. And so, here's Jesus that has
[1:08:38] made his travels to come to Pharisees
[1:08:40] house to Simon's house to sit down and
[1:08:43] meet with him. And as he sits down,
[1:08:47] he's got dirty feet from the dust of
[1:08:50] that age of, you know, the roads ain't
[1:08:53] like they are today. the the same roads
[1:08:55] that the donkeys went down, the cattle
[1:08:58] went down, people went down
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; wearing sandals and just walking and the
[1:09:03] way that they would have robes and the
[1:09:05] dust would fly up and and I mean, you're
[1:09:07] walking in the manure and it's not a
[1:09:10] pretty sight.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; It's not streets of gold,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; and your feet get filthy of all the
[1:09:18] things of the world,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; of all the things of life. Yeah,
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; but there's a little lady that heard
[1:09:27] maybe the commotion that that was going
[1:09:30] on around Simon's house.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; And there's the commotion and she's
[1:09:34] going, "Wonder what? What's going on?"
[1:09:35] And and she maybe hears, "It's Jesus.
[1:09:37] It's Jesus." And this little lady from
[1:09:40] all of the things that she's been
[1:09:41] through in life thinks, "I've got to get
[1:09:45] to Jesus.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; I've got to get to him."
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; And she hears that, "Well, they're
[1:09:51] making fun of him. They're not even
[1:09:53] washing his feet because before you
[1:09:55] would go into a house in that day, they
[1:09:57] had what they called footwash flunkies.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; A job that Jesus would step down and
[1:10:03] become a footwash flunky
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; for even his disciples. One of the
[1:10:07] lowest of lowest of jobs.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; And there he sat and they would not even
[1:10:13] attend. I'm sure that Simon had gave
[1:10:17] specific orders. All the other guests
[1:10:20] wash their feet. Grant them with a kiss.
[1:10:23] Give them a robe as they would enter.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; But this man, don't touch him.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Don't touch him. I am going to make a
[1:10:32] public spectacle of Jesus today.
[1:10:37] Simon, a Pharisee, one of the great
[1:10:39] religious leaders of this day, making
[1:10:42] fun of Jesus. That's
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; right. And here is this little girl,
[1:10:47] this little lady that life has been not
[1:10:51] fair to her.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Maybe she was put into this lifestyle
[1:10:56] because she had to.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Used and abused of men around that city,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; One of the lowest of the lowest. And
[1:11:06] here she is. And she sees Jesus with
[1:11:10] dirty feet.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; So, you know what she does? She runs
[1:11:14] back to her home. Brother Brandham says
[1:11:17] is maybe she pulled out this sock that
[1:11:18] she had been saving money in for years
[1:11:21] and years. And she runs to this store
[1:11:24] where they would sell ointments,
[1:11:26] alabaster box of ointments, where would
[1:11:29] we keep precious perfumes and fragrance
[1:11:32] and here she comes into this this
[1:11:36] storekeeper and brother Brandon would
[1:11:37] say that he would like he would had had
[1:11:40] a bad mood because he couldn't pay his
[1:11:42] rent.
[1:11:43] What do you want?
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; I want to buy the best of the best
[1:11:49] perfume. I want the very best you got.
[1:11:54] What are you doing in here? Someone's of
[1:11:56] your liking. You can't afford this.
[1:12:00] I could just see his face as she would
[1:12:02] pull out maybe that sock full of money.
[1:12:06] Where'd you get that money at?
[1:12:10] She'd say, "I want the very best you
[1:12:11] got." Amen.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Well, who are you to buy something like
[1:12:16] this?
[1:12:18] Brother Brandham would say, "In perfect
[1:12:20] strength by perfect weakness." And we
[1:12:22] find out that those people who are the
[1:12:25] weakest and rejected by the outside
[1:12:27] world is God's heroes.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That conqueror up on the front line
[1:12:32] takes those who feel themselves
[1:12:33] unworthy. Notice that it takes the
[1:12:36] weakest and rejected. And practically
[1:12:38] every hero God ever had on the front
[1:12:41] lines was a type of that person.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; A person that was rejected. A person
[1:12:47] that thought he was insignificant. She
[1:12:50] thought she was insignificant, unworthy
[1:12:53] to go wash Jesus's feet.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; A person that had no ability at all.
[1:12:58] Then that person just in good a shape so
[1:13:02] God can start using them. That's right.
[1:13:05] When they feel like they can't, they
[1:13:07] haven't got nothing, that's when God can
[1:13:10] take a hold of them and do something
[1:13:12] with them. You see, but when we are
[1:13:15] thinking that we're able to do it, then
[1:13:18] God can't use us because we're wanting
[1:13:22] to do it ourselves,
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; but he takes the ones that think they're
[1:13:26] insignificant,
[1:13:28] the ones that think they can't do it.
[1:13:31] That's God's heroes. Here is this little
[1:13:34] hero in the Bible that's thinking,
[1:13:36] questioning in her mind, I am unworthy.
[1:13:40] He will know who I am. He will know what
[1:13:43] I've done. He will know where this money
[1:13:45] come from that I bought this alabaster
[1:13:48] box with.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, and maybe she
[1:13:52] turned to go out of the house, out of
[1:13:54] that store. She turned around and said,
[1:13:56] "No,
[1:13:58] no, I'm going to buy that and I'm going
[1:14:01] to take and put that on the Lord Jesus."
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; And there's Jesus sitting in the house.
[1:14:10] Not a kiss, not a robe, but they're over
[1:14:14] in the corner making fun of him.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Simon making light of Jesus.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Look at him. Look at Look at him. Just
[1:14:23] filthy. See, he thinks he's got power.
[1:14:27] We have the power. Look at this feast
[1:14:29] that I've put on.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Look at my house that I have. He don't
[1:14:33] even have a house to live in.
[1:14:37] Look at him. Dirty feet.
[1:14:41] Why would anybody want to have relation
[1:14:45] of friendship with Jesus?
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:49] And I can see this little lady as she's
[1:14:51] pressing through the crowd because
[1:14:54] wherever Jesus is, there's people.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Wherever Jesus is, there's going to be a
[1:14:59] gathering.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; She presses through, makes her way. No
[1:15:05] one could stop her from doing what she's
[1:15:07] about to do.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; And she goes and she takes and she's
[1:15:14] crying,
[1:15:16] weeping. Tears are flowing so much.
[1:15:21] She begins to wash Jesus's feet.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Wash over and over again. She begins to
[1:15:31] kiss his feet over and over again.
[1:15:36] Washing the filth
[1:15:38] of the dirt, the dung, all of it off of
[1:15:43] Jesus's feet.
[1:15:45] all of it.
[1:15:48] Her hair is now starting to mat over as
[1:15:51] she's rubbing all this dirt. As she's
[1:15:53] taking all of this off of him,
[1:15:59] see her strength
[1:16:02] was in her kneeling and worshiping
[1:16:04] Jesus.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my. There you go.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; See, it takes strength to pour out
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; what you've been saving.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; She's been saving a lot.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. She didn't know what she
[1:16:14] was saving all that money for, but now
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; up to this point, now she knows.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Out of all of the torment that I've been
[1:16:25] through,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I have been saving all of this for this
[1:16:30] moment.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Church, I I just want you to recognize
[1:16:33] what a moment that that was.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; What a moment in time for her
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; that it took.
[1:16:42] poured out everything that she had
[1:16:45] within her. Everything she owned
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; was in that alabaster box.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; But what she walked away with was
[1:16:54] greater than anything she'd ever been
[1:16:57] through in life.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Any persecution
[1:17:01] that she'd ever went through, she would
[1:17:02] walk down the streets. People would
[1:17:04] maybe look at her and turn the other
[1:17:06] way,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Despising her because of what she had
[1:17:10] been,
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:12] Now she sits at Jesus's feet,
[1:17:15] washing our Lord Jesus.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "When I am weak, then I
[1:17:24] am strong."
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And that's what this woman was living
[1:17:28] out. Her tears weren't a sign of defeat.
[1:17:32] They were evidence of deliverance.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Her silence wasn't weakness.
[1:17:38] It was worship. That's right.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; She was worshiping
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus honors the heart,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Not the reputation.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; See, and there's Simon over in the
[1:17:53] corner now, making light of both of
[1:17:56] them. Why is she here?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Why is she washing his feet?
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Simon saw her sin.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw her worship.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Simon saw all of her humanity.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus saw forgiveness.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; And they're making light of what the
[1:18:24] situation is.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; But she didn't care
[1:18:28] now that she's at the one Savior's feet
[1:18:32] washing Jesus's feet. And as she would
[1:18:37] begin to break that alabaster box,
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; that perfume over and begin to just wash
[1:18:44] his feet with now the perfume, the
[1:18:46] fragrance.
[1:18:48] See, once you break that, there's no
[1:18:50] putting it back.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Once that sweet smelling savior comes
[1:18:56] into the room,
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; you just can't get rid of it now.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Now it has filled the room.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the people of the banquet are
[1:19:07] starting to realize
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; what's going on.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; I would say that day Simon the Pharisee
[1:19:15] lost a few friends.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; If they were in their right mind, they
[1:19:19] lost he lost a few friends that day
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; because that day they caught on to what
[1:19:25] he was trying to do.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; When you rejected your own flunkies to
[1:19:30] do the job they're meant to do. And now
[1:19:32] this lady of her reputation is sitting
[1:19:36] here washing his feet.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; I would say that day Simon's house
[1:19:43] become empty over the next few years.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And as he would go,
[1:19:51] he would begin to think in himself, if
[1:19:54] he knew who she was,
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; there it is. Right?
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; If Jesus really knew who she was, he
[1:20:01] would stop her from touching him. He
[1:20:04] would stop her from doing this.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; If he really knew who she was now, Simon
[1:20:11] is thinking this
[1:20:13] in the scriptures, you even know he's
[1:20:15] thinking this,
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; But he says, Jesus then says,"Simon,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; I have somewhat to say to thee."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:26] When Simon's thinking it, Jesus is
[1:20:28] knowing.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows your heart.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows Satan's heart.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; The struggles that he's putting against
[1:20:38] y'all.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; The torments that he's putting upon you.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, buddy.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; But he is not going to leave you in this
[1:20:50] estate.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. He is not going to just
[1:20:53] keep you here
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; in this condition. That's
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; He didn't keep her in that condition.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; That day.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; The perfume has now filled the room.
[1:21:08] Now every ear is attuned to what Jesus
[1:21:11] is about to say to Simon.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; The master of the house
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; is now the master of the house. Amen.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He showed up.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Simon, Simon, I have somewhat to say to
[1:21:25] thee.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; When I entered this door, you refused to
[1:21:30] wash my feet.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Why I set, you refused to give me a
[1:21:35] kiss.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; You refused to give me a robe to enter
[1:21:39] the banqueting room.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Right? But this lady since she has come
[1:21:43] into the house, she has not stopped to
[1:21:47] wash my feet.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; She has not stopped to give me kiss. She
[1:21:52] anointed my feet with perfume. That's
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Then he says, Simon, there's there was a
[1:22:05] debtor, a creditor.
[1:22:08] Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Two people owed this creditor,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; 1500
[1:22:13] and 150. And this creditor comes and he
[1:22:17] forgives both of them.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Who do you think
[1:22:23] worshiped him the most?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Who do you think
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; thanked him the most?
[1:22:30] And Simon thought,
[1:22:34] got myself in a pickle.
[1:22:40] probably the one that he forgave the
[1:22:41] most. Lord,
[1:22:44] he he's beginning to get a little
[1:22:46] religious himself.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Simon, you said right. You're right,
[1:22:54] Simon. You got something right today.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:01] Because this lady,
[1:23:04] though her sins were many,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; all
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; are forgiven.
[1:23:12] [applause]
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Because [cheering] Jesus sitting there
[1:23:20] with kindness because he's invited.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Simon wanted to make him look weak.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; But now, who's the stronger one? Who has
[1:23:30] the most power in the building?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; When you think you're strong, you're
[1:23:40] weak.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; When I think I'm weak, I'm strong.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; But there's Jesus, the most powerful one
[1:23:49] of all. The one that hold the stars, the
[1:23:52] heavens in existence.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; The one that created every single one of
[1:23:57] us.
[1:23:59] now is forgiving her all of her sins.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; As she looks at that little lady,
[1:24:09] he gives her the best words that she
[1:24:12] ever has received.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; All thy sins are forgiven.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Go in peace.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Go
[1:24:24] in peace.
[1:24:27] Though it's a very delicate
[1:24:31] and beautiful word, peace,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; there's enough power in all of heaven
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; to break every chain
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; that ever held her bound
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; there. He was
[1:24:48] creator of heaven and earth.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Go in peace.
[1:24:52] Thy sins are forgiven you.
[1:24:58] That's what many of us have heard.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Go in peace.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Many of us have heard those words. All
[1:25:05] your sins are forgiven you.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; See, as brother William was preaching
[1:25:11] last night, you must be born again.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And when you are born again,
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; oh,
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; I don't care what you've done.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; go in peace.
[1:25:27] Though the world might think you're weak
[1:25:30] for where you're standing at now,
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; you're in a most powerful position.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; You have more power than the angels in
[1:25:39] heaven.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; When you can sing Amazing Grace, how
[1:25:45] sweet the sound
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; that saved a wretch like me.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Not even the angels can sing that song.
[1:25:51] That's right.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; One of these days when we all walk
[1:25:55] through those heavenly gates,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; step on those streets of gold and we're
[1:26:01] singing Amazing Grace.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; There's going to be church ages that has
[1:26:07] been there for years, years, and years.
[1:26:10] And they're going to say, "Who is that?"
[1:26:12] That's the bride of Christ.
[1:26:15] The children of Leota that made it
[1:26:17] through. Amen.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; One of the most wicked
[1:26:22] and tormenting ages of all.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; They made it through.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; How did they make it through through
[1:26:30] that?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Because there was a power that was
[1:26:34] laying on the inside of them.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; That not even Satan could come against.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; So when Satan comes to buffet you, you
[1:26:45] just remind him.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother William said, there's a
[1:26:48] good game trail back and forth to where
[1:26:50] I've drawn him back to where I left it
[1:26:52] all.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; You remind him where your sins are
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; You can't bring them back up, Satan.
[1:27:03] [applause]
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You can't torment me with anymore,
[1:27:06] Satan.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:27:20] Don't mistake his mercy for weakness.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; He was humble enough to wash their feet,
[1:27:26] but holy enough to forgive their sins.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; He was gentle enough to cradle a child,
[1:27:32] but powerful enough to calm the raging
[1:27:35] sea.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He was silent before the accusers,
[1:27:39] but savior over the grave.
[1:27:44] He could bleed like a man, but yet he
[1:27:46] rose like a king.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; That's my savior.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Meek, but never weak.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Lowly, but never lacking. Slain, but
[1:27:57] never stopped. So don't mistake my
[1:28:00] kindness for weakness. I'm walking in
[1:28:03] power with the one who turned his pain
[1:28:06] into power and his cross into a crown.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.
[1:28:12] Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say that this morning? Don't
[1:28:15] mistake my kindness for weakness.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; You're a strong people.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; You're a strong bride.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; The thorn didn't stop Paul's message. It
[1:28:26] strengthens his message.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; The same grace that held him up is the
[1:28:30] same grace that's holding me right now.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; I may bleed, but I still believe. I may
[1:28:36] bend, but I won't break. I may walk with
[1:28:39] a limp, but I won't walk without power.
[1:28:42] Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Because every scar is a story of my
[1:28:46] survival.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Every tear is a testimony of my grace.
[1:28:50] Every weakness is an opportunity for God
[1:28:53] to show himself strong.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; So don't mistake my kindness for
[1:28:58] weakness.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; There's power in this pain, purpose in
[1:29:04] pressure, victory in this valley. The
[1:29:07] thorn didn't come to take me out.
[1:29:10] It came to give God glory.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; As long as his grace is sufficient,
[1:29:16] remember what that means? Fully
[1:29:19] adequate.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; His grace is fully adequate.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; I'm still standing. I'm still surviving.
[1:29:28] I'm still shouting.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; For when I am weak, [applause]
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; then I am strong.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Give him praise in the house of God this
[1:29:38] morning. [applause]
[1:29:40] Thank you Lord for when I am weak
[1:29:44] [applause]
[1:29:45] then I am strong.
[1:29:49] Thank you Lord. [applause] We worship
[1:29:52] you Lord. We pour our worship out upon
[1:29:55] you this morning. We give you glory
[1:29:58] Lord. We thank you Lord. Let the aroma
[1:30:02] just feel this presence.
[1:30:04] Feel it in the church this morning.
[1:30:06] Thank you Jesus.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; worshiping you.
[1:30:14] I'm worshiping you. [music]
[1:30:20] Oh, there's nothing [music and singing]
[1:30:22] else that I
[1:30:27] Oh, there's nothing I'd rather do than
[1:30:29] worship you. Oh, worshiping [music] you.
[1:30:35] I'm woriing you. [music]
[1:30:41] You make it easy, Lord. Cuz I'm so in
[1:30:46] love with you. I long for those moments.
[1:30:53] I long for those [music] moments when
