and we just we thank the Lord for the work that they have put in behind that and so we we encourage you to do so if you have not seen it to go and watch it and it's it's a very tremendous testimony of God's grace and that God is still a miracle working God that's why we're here this evening is because God is still God Amen Acts chapter four and verse seven we'd like to speak to you this evening again on the moment of the miraculous and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this then Peter filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of Israel if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he has made whole be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel by that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him this man stand here before you hold this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which has become the head of the corner neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could not they could say nothing against it but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred amongst themselves saying what shall we do with these men for indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot denied amen may God bless his word he may be seated this evening I love it when the enemy cannot figure out an excuse I love it when the enemy has to just sit there completely quiet because they know that they can't deny what has taken place in front of them here's a man that that we've read many times in the scriptures we've read over this story how that this man was crippled from his mother's wounds how that he laid there at that beautiful gate day in and day out and would sit there and beg for alms and now this man the Bible tells us if you go on to read that this man was above 40 years old so that the so that the testimony was was more sure because of his age and because of all of his years laying there and setting in that condition it made the miracle more outstanding because of what how prolific the miracle was you can imagine as this man as he had set there by that gate day in and sitting there begging for alms how that how that he would watch normal people how that they would walk he would watch as some people how that they would carry themselves some having a limp and some having a different sway about them he would watch people of of different statures of society men of rich and men of poor he would sit there and watch but no doubt he would long no matter who who passed him how rich they were or what kind of garments they had on I'd say that his mindset was oh if I could only allow my my limbs to operate like their limbs he know when you're in that condition it doesn't really matter money doesn't matter to you it doesn't matter how big a house you're in when you're in that type of a condition you're just waiting for your moment of miraculous and I could imagine his mindset sitting there I've been sitting here I'm all I'm over 40 years old I've been laying here by this gate day in and day out people walk past me and people go by me but yet there's been no help but at this moment that when Peter and John walk past a beautiful gate to go to the house of worship his eyes fell upon different men that day and and when Peter looked on him he knew that he was begging for arms and he looked at him and he said brother Peter is silver and gold have I none but such as I have give are thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk you see the moment that he had dreamed of the moment that he had laid there and thought about all of his life all of his years laying there was now that moment was standing in front of him only the events that had led up of all of the things that were going through his mind well will I ever be healed will I ever be touched will I ever get up out of my stupor will I ever rise up out of this condition but at this moment all of the events and the process of time had led up to this moment of the miraculous he had to realize that there was more than a man that was standing there but this was none other than Jesus Christ of Nazareth that walked the shores of Galilee that raised Lazarus from the grave that touched the lepers and they were made clean that raised the widow of nain son this was that same God living in his apostles Peter and John his moment was not for verse a done by Jesus in His own corporal body but it was done in his many member body that same God is alive today you see wherever God is it is supernatural because God is a supernatural God and we are witnesses tonight and we are here to prove that there is a living God amongst us can you testify of that that there is a living God amongst us you see where God is it's a supernatural but I want you to know that to God the supernatural is just natural to us whenever a healing takes place or a miracle takes place it's supernatural but with God it's natural you see it's natural for God to be in your car and be reading your book it's natural for God to show up and work miracles in your life it's natural for God to come by your way and speak directly to you it's natural for God because he's God it's natural for God to deliver you from your chains and your bondage of your seeing as your fear it's natural for him to do that because he's God he's God tonight I hope you don't mind me talking about a God that heals because that's what I'm gonna talk about tonight I hope you don't mind me talking about that God that works miracles because that's a God that I'm serving and I have found in life that whenever you go to talking about God God shows up hallelujah all of humanity after the fall of humanity and we look over in the book of Genesis we look at the fall of humanity and and we see there that God had commanded Adam and Eve to not protect of a certain tree of the garden and it was not the Apple in the tree that calls the fall it was the pair on the ground that caused the fall and you see God had foretold when he was cursing the serpent which was an upright beast he was not a reptile but that here at this moment he cursed the beasts the curse that serpent to his belly that he would eat dust the rest of his days but he told him in Genesis chapter 3 and 15 that I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed we agree that the woman had a seed and we realized that that was Christ and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel we realize it is a well-known predicted it is predicted well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross and there at the cross Christ would bruise the head of Satan and all of the prophets of old were looking for the coming of this serpent Bruce they were looking for the coming of the Messiah and when Christ rose on the scene those that came in contact with him excluding all the unbelievers they recognized him believe that this was the Messiah they recognized that the one that's doing these miracles Nicodemus had to recognize that God was with him Lazarus when he come up out of the grave he recognized he thought it but yet he recognized when he come out of that tomb and he had his old grave close on that there was more than a man that was standing on the outside of that tomb how many of you have been spoken to when you are wrapped up in your grave clothes and you realize that it was more than a man that was talking to you that called you out of the trespasses but their sins in life it was more than a man that read your book it was more than a man that told you to play that tape it was more than a man that told you to come to church and I say to you tonight more than a man is in this building halleluja halleluja but when death came at Calvary all of the disciples and all of his followers they watched him be spit on they watched him as he was ridiculed they watched him as he was mocked and scourged and those that had hoped that this was the Messiah all of their hope seemed to be fading away at this moment it looked like all hope was gone of him being the Messiah after seeing all that the disciples had seen you can imagine all of the miracles that had taken place and Jesus's ministry but all of these things that the disciples had seen seemed to kind of fade away in their memory when they watched their Savior going down when they watched him hang there as he took the crux of the curse it man whoa but they didn't realize the power of the cross that he was going there for them but they watched him as he climbed the Galvez Hill they watched him as he was spit on they watched him as he was whipped they watched him and they thought all hope is gone of this being our Messiah but Jesus would tell them over and over and over again believe me that I am in the father and the Father me and if you can't believe that believe the works that I do for the works that I do prove Who I am the words that Jesus did proved who he was it proved that he was the Messiah he proved when he was there hanging at Calvary that he was everything that God had for ordained before the law began hallelujah all of these miracles as we would stack him up in Jesus's ministry as they would come to pass the Bible says over in the book of John chapter 21 that the Bible could not contain all of the miracles that were done the world could not contain the miracles that were done in the Ministry of Jesus Christ and in the early 1950s brother Badham you'll hear him say in the early 1950s we have seen we have seen him do mighty more miracles in this humble ministry than he did in all of his earthly ministry in three and a half years that same God has amongst us but after seeing all the mighty works that God did still doubt entered into their heart but early on Easter morning early on Easter morning hope began to rise when death could not contain him and the grave could not hold him in that moment in that moment when every bit of sin was hanging in the balance when humanity was hanging in the balance was this mother Messiah or not but in that moment the miraculous took place the same question was settled there forever the requirement had been met hallelujah they watched him bowel Friday but they watched him rise on Sunday hallelujah he's God he looked like a man when he was crying at Lazarus his grief but when he said Lazarus come forth it was more than a man that was speaking and the same son of man is speaking come forth little bride come forth rise up out of your super rather plan of your unbelief rise up this is your moment for gospel lighthouse rasa rasa past her fears razza pester unbelief rise up when he was here on earth he said he was God he looked like God he talked like God he preached like God hallelujah He healed like God heroes like dava he ascended like God because he was God he was God in the flesh God was in his son manifesting himself to his people and that's my god the Bible was never written to show us what God has done in the past but the Bible was written to show us who God is somebody say who God is and what he wants to do in every generation in every walk of life everywhere on earth to live in a people as that's right the Bible says in Genesis 33 excuse me Galatians 3 and 23 the devil don't like me using this microphone he's trying to hit her in every way he can but I got something to deliver tonight Galatians 3 and 23 but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up under the faith which was should all should afterwards be revealed you see the law kept us shut up it kept us bound the law only pointed out sin but it had no great sinner law was the policeman but it yet it had no grace in it we're for the law verse 24 was our was our schoolmaster to bring unto us Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are now no longer we are no longer under a schoolmaster for ye are all children of God by faith somebody say by faith we are all the children of God by faith excuse me in Christ Jesus for as many of you as of you have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ for there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there's neither male nor female for here all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise bear with me Alleluia you wait more for a hamburger than you will for this tonight I want nothing to hinder me tonight how I look and if you be Christ hello if you be Christ's if he be Christ I hope somebody hears me tonight I don't got all the hindrances out of the way if you be Christ's then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise God give has given us a sure promise to Abraham seed that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thee and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies you were elected to this before the foundation of the world you were born to be serpent bruisers before there was a world you were elected to it you were elected to take a hold of it and you will win the battle if you be Christ you will win the battle if you be Christ you will come out overcomers if you big Christ that's nothing gonna hold you back if they be Christ Oh hallelujah Satan your kingdoms coming down if you be Christ come on somebody he tried his very best to destroy Christ and he could not destroy him and if ye be Christ's he cannot destroy you because you are a part of God [Applause] I'm a part of God I'm an heir of salvation purchase of God we are a people that's been called by his name same life same power the Book of Daniel tells us that the people that do know their God will be strong and shall do exploits Paul said in the book of Ephesians 5 and 27 that this church would be a glorious church without spot without wrinkle and without a blemish there's nothing that's laid at your Accord the blood of Jesus Christ has made you sinless the blood of Jesus Christ has made you justified as if you've never done it before the world began you never did it to begin with God did not see you in your sin God did not see you in your despair God seen you in perfection the devil would support to you and point you to your mistakes and point to your failures but you point to Christ that's what God seen you as [Applause] improving his word he said we should realize that in us has been given we who believe Jesus Christ and been born of his spirit and filled with that quickening power that power that's in you somebody say Amen by laying on hands on the others like the disciples did and down through the age it's absolutely heal the sick it's raised the dead it showed visions and prophecies and the very same spirit that lived amongst the early apostles is living in the church today working the very same things and as quick as we can recognize that no matter how much it's working you've got to recognize and believe that he won't do you one bit of good until you believe it he won't do you one bit of good till you believe but the moment that you believe your troubles are ended the moment that you believe it your troubles are in you know God is omnipotent he's all-powerful God's not not big heavy spots and guy he's not not little bitty weak spots every every little bit of touch of God he's omnipotent the least little touch of God he's omnipotent who I could preach all night just from that one quote right there the least little touch of God he's all-powerful you know dad used to work in the Arsenal in the government there whether they made nitroglycerine and that dad would come and he would tell us of these stories about men that would take just a little tablespoon of nitroglycerin and they set it on a stump and shoot it from several hundred yards away and he would blow a stump completely out of the ground just that little bit of nitroglycerin would blow a stump out of the ground why one day we was down at a yard and we was working and the man was telling us that this material this piece of metal that we were buying it came out of the Arsenal in which that worked him and when he began to tell to have that dad looked at it he said yeah he said I remember that I remember that piece of material I remember that how how that those things were there in the Arsenal and great dad just grabbed that piece of metal and just threw it up on the trailer I took a great big step back because I had heard the stories of what nitroglycerin would do that if a building would go off it would blow down in the ground several hundred feet and they would have to go in there and if somebody was in there and looked for bodies I knew what nitroglycerine could do and here dad just takes that thing and throws it on the trailer I'm glad it didn't blow up but you think about the natural power of nitroglycerin of what it can do what about the power of God the least little touch of God when he touches your life touches your sin touches your sickness touches your life it'll completely set you free it'll blow it'll blow the gates of Hale right off of it the least little touch of God Ephesians three and twenty now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the dynamite that worketh in US whoo hallelujah that works in you little bride according to the dynamite power that works in you will say turn your kingdoms coming down oh I said say turn your kingdoms coming down we serve a notice honey today it's over it's over we're sick and tired of putting up with your tactics we're sick and tired of putting up of your attacks it's over fullbacks for lighthouse I want you to hear me loud and clear this is your moment for the miraculous I want you tonight to step out in faith and receive the promise that God ordained for you to receive this is your promise you're his children you're his people you're his wife you are greater than any Congress you're greater than any president you're the Queen of Heaven access your authority and night and speak to your Mountain hallelujah this Bible that you read daily the author the book was to come he wants to come into your life and so forth his power his hat tributes in your life to demonstrate that there's no God like Jehovah and I have found in my Christian walk I have found that God loves to declare his power he loves to declare that he's God he loves to declare and decree there's no god like him but God on that hand does not clown for nobody is that right he don't clown for nobody he's God he only does his will he's only going to do that which pleases him but you you see you cannot force God or push going around to work a miracle in your life this is what I'm gonna make God do this because I know he's able you can't push God into doing something but yet on the other hand you can accept God's Word by faith and faith like a grain of mustard seed will roll your Mountain over you can't push God into it but your faith will bring it to pass oh I tell you what is a kidney stone to God what is sickness to God come on somebody what's a Barren womb to God what's a distraught home to God absolutely nothing you got to realize who's fighting with you in the battle a lot of times we get the idea that we're all alone and nobody else is fighting with me that nobody else is working with me but if you can ever open up your spiritual eyes and realize that the battles not mine but the battle is the Lord's you've got to realize that there's more than a man fighting for you Oh hallelujah he's a man of war and he's never lost the fight he's the chief captain of the hosts of the Lord and he's not lost war there's a lot of men that fall for General Lee and fall for Stonewall Jackson but they lost battles and they lost Wars but this God that you're fighting with he ain't never lost one battle he's not lost one case it's never nothing too hard for the Lord [Applause] you God has something supernatural for you tonight is that I do you believe that tonight you got to realize who you fighting with you got to realize the God that's on your side tonight you got a real high state you're not only losing side but you're on the winning side you've got to realize that even though you can't see them working you got to know that he's working you've got to realize that when you are in the midst of the battle and you're

doctor but the Nathan he's a surgeon he's your everything you've got to realize that you and God were built to be partners in the miraculous I'm a partner with God and if God is your partner you better have big plans somebody say God's my partner and we are partners in the miraculous we're partners in the instantaneous we're partners in the paradox it's unbelievable but yet it's true you walk into a business meeting your next business meeting and they want to know what your assets are you tell them that your father owns the cattle on a Thousand Hills they want to know what kind of insurance you got you can tell them blessed assurance Jesus mom they want to know what you can do you say I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me and greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world greater than cancer greater than anything greater than t be greater than MRSA greater than any sickness that God's living in me hello you one of three Hebrew children when they walked into that moment that they needed more than a man to step up they were in a moment they had caught himself up in a moment that could not be divided they had walked into a moment that they needed that God to show up and that's when the miraculous shows up God loves to put you in those spots just to show that he's God and when the three Hebrew children when they walked into the flames of the fire they said there's one walking that's one walking in the midst of the fire he's still in the fire tonight Church and he's walking in the flames and he'll be there to help you if you call on Jesus name in their moment the miraculous took place and the story has never stopped from being told David was so anointed that a giant couldn't kill him Daniel was so filled with the Holy Ghost that lines couldn't eat him and this bride is so filled and anointed by a mighty angel that there is no two hundred thousand thousand demons that will stop her from rising enough out of the ashes of despair there's no demon that's going to stop the purpose of God you are born for this moment you are gain to step into the vision this is your moment step into the miraculous if three Hebrew children could walk into the fire what about 200 children and I why don't you walk into the promise tonight the promises of God have no stay halation on them they don't care if you rich they don't care if you're poor the promise is yea and amen the promise don't care if you're yellow black or white aren't you yellow the promises are for you tonight the promise has no stipulation Hornung the promise don't care what kind of house you live there he don't care if you live in a cardboard box the promise is for you tonight whoo you see miracles happen when God is taking out his word when the angel of the Lord make jihad on that Gideon there in the book of Judges when I met him there and he was standing there and he said thou our mighty man of Valor and the Lord is with thee and Gideon said if God before us why is all of these things befallen us while we out here hiding and threshing wheat in a in in a field under an oak tree we're all back here we're scared we ain't got no courage at all if God is for us then why are all these things befallen us I wonder sometimes if that ain't our attitude why is it me pour me pour me pour me if God is for us then where's his miracles if that's your resolution tonight here's your miracle if you think God don't do it no more if you're a miracle tonight I want you to stand up if God be for us then we're be all of his miracles they're right here hallelujah hallelujah god bless you could be seated you see when Gideon begin to act upon God's Word he then seen the miracle when he went in and got himself a kid got a goat and took it out there and placed it upon the altar and the angel of the Lord touched it with a rod and consumed it with fire he's seen the miracle working God was with him and if you will ever lay yourself upon the altar and sacrifice your life you begin to see the miracles of God you see how are you going to see the miracles of God until you become a miracle of God this man had somet God that God ordained him that he took 300 men and went down and destroyed a hundred and thirty-five thousand Midianites the odds were stacked up against him it was four hundred to 1 million nights against the years her life but when God is your partner and when God is fighting on your side no weapon that is formed against me shall prosper he will give you a battle plan that will make sure you come out victorious he'll give you a battle plan that will show you that you're on the winning side you look dull you look over in the book of Exodus and you see the mighty man mighty hand of God that God was a mighty man of war when he'd come down and he produced 10 major miracles that were done there in Egypt God's power was shown and the enemy was thwarted sure they had their impersonators sure they had their impersonators but who was first it was Moses you see they could go along with all of their miracles and all of those things trying to follow right in with Moses but Moses is you remember when Moses threw down his rod and then they threw down those magicians of Janus and Jambres flew down there odd Moses his rod ate up the impersonators this word will eat up the impersonators any day of the week this word will defeat Satan any time any place under any circumstance time after time God show forth his power so that he was a miracle working God and finally it come down to it that the enemy Pharaoh decided to let God's people go but you know one thing I have found about how about the devil sister Stephanie is that he's a stupid ever after the children of Israel walk out in Egypt they walk out of the cosmos here the enemy comes chasing them again the enemy loves to put his fear tactics over upon you and tell you that you'll never be able to be free but God's got a word for you that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty there's a freedom in this place that if you feel like you can't be set free there's a God that's here that's got the keys to the chains that are holding you bound and the enemy chased them all the way down to the Red Sea and it looks like that that the enemy had dogs children backed up into a corner but I have found in life that God that's where he shows up is when you look like you're backed in a corner when all of humanity was backed in a corner Adams race was backed in a corner there came one from heaven and when the children of Israel went back into a corner when the air when the Pharaoh and all of his army were breathing down upon them it looked like they were backed up into a corner and then there came a voice in that moment that spake unto Moses walk rock speaking and go forward this process this was a process that led to a moment of the miraculous for over 440 years the process of time was going on but at that moment the miraculous showed up that Red Sea had been there since God created in the world but God chose this place hallelujah God chose this place to drown his enemy in since before the time began but God chose that place to destroy his enemy how about you tonight the Bloods been there for 2,000 years it's been there God the lamb God's lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he saw the perfect place to destroy your enemy and in the blood of Jesus Christ how this process led to a miracle that'll never be forgotten we're two million people walked across on dry land he's still the same God you see because of this miracle lives have been changed I was telling about the miracle of this in Arkansas not too long ago I was telling about all of the odds that have been stacked up against God's children and stacked up against God but God knew exactly God knew exactly how to get his children across and there was a sister there that was dealing with fibromyalgia and in that instance she stood up and said if God can do that what about my sickness if God can do all of that what about depression what about anxiety because of this miracle Rahab had faith to apply the token because of this miracle Jericho was all walled in and shut up and their hearts melted and courage had left them here was a miracle inside of a and I wonder how many miracles are laying on the inside of you I wonder when you decide to raise your voice I wonder when you decide to let out your shout how many miracles are coming out of Rahab's house I wonder tonight I wonder if there's some mamas and daddies or sisters or brothers that say mama daddy get in this household get under this token get under here because that's coming us out that's coming to shout get in here the walls are coming around but you're a sword under this token you will be safe and you will be secure there's miracles in the miracle and when the children of Israel got on the other side of this miracle there came a sound when they got on the other side of the Red Sea there became a sound that will never be forgotten because they had seen their taskmasters they had seen the ones that had whipped them time and time again they had seen they had seen they had seen their Avenger cast into the sea and they seen chariot wheels fly out floating up to the top of the Red Sea you talking about a feeling when you look out there and you see the enemy that once held you bound is completely destroy that enemy that keeps telling you that you're gonna have to put up with anxiety the rest of your life I want you to know he's a roaring line but he ain't got no teeth in his mouth he can roar oh he wants to but it's barked his bark is way louder than his bite oh yeah you can breathe down my neck all you want to you can tell me I'm going to be two feet at all you won't to but let me get on the other side of the blood let me get on the other side of the blood yeah hallelujah let me get on the other side of the Red Sea and that's coming out of shout it's coming out of dance on the other side that's coming out of praise on the other side that's coming out of my voice a worship that's coming out of my mouth of praise that's coming out of my mouth uh shall I hallelujah I think you're Jesus that's coming out of my mouth on the other side of the issue hello did their sound match their miracle Exodus 15 and 1 then sang Moses who you're talking about a song singing service yeah well the Mathew sometimes when I get up here and I lead services sometimes when you lead service it's almost more than you could handle because the people have come expected you know you know when you walk to this pulpit that those they're children of God have come to worship you know that sometimes that yes sometimes you're just pushing you're trying you sticking that plow in trying to get that ground fertile but there's some times when you walk out here and it feels like every hair on your heads blowing backwards because there's a children of God that are under expectation they have seen a mighty God in action and he's worth praising could you imagine the prophet Moses as he began to sing this song how he felt hallelujah I don't know how long Moses his beard was but I'd say ever he would every hair home there was sticking completely straight out there's some times when I get to singing up here it feels like everybody every one of these red hairs I got on my head I standing completely out and I'm thankful for the jail that I put on my hair or I'd look like one of these crazies today because there's a supernatural God that is and that is accepting I worship and then Moses sang and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake saying I will sing a to the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea the Lord is my strength and song he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him a habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name Pharaoh's chariots and his hosts hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains are also drowned in the Red Sea the deaths have covered them they sink in the bottom as a stone thy right hand no Lord has become glorious and power the right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sin is forth our wrath which consumed me as a stubble and with the blast of my nostrils the waters were gathered together the flood stood upright as a heap the depths were concealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said notice his last words the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hands shall destroy them but thou did its blow with a wind the sea covered them they say kiss in the mighty waters who is likened to the Lord among the gods who is like unto our God who is like me glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders you tell me are the gods of Laodicea like this God I'm the gods of Michael Jordan and Tom Brady and LeBron James like this God can those god save you from the Red Sea can those God save you from the chariots but this God has so said as I upon you that he will not lose you and he will not leave you and he will not forsake you no matter what you're going through even when you don't feel in working I know that you're working even when I don't see that you're working I know that you're working because you never stop you never stop you never stop working my god Daniel Williams came to Tim Pruett service when he when he had got into a spa and his last service that he preached there I believe he came to the pulpit what checked himself out of the hospital after he had had surgeries and different things and he walked to the pulpit and preached about the God that I serve he said I don't know about the gods of the sports room I don't know about the gods of the professor's I don't know about the gods of Congress but this God this God I know about that God I know that this God works miracles I know that this God is a healer I want you to try this God tonight and see if he fits the bill and I promise you that he will they were shouting because the miracle their sound was matching the miracle you know we got our critics today the critics of our praise the critics of our worship the critics of our preaching and they're even here tonight we got our critics of praise and our critics of worship they're trying to tell us how we should and how we shouldn't worship God they tell us what type of songs that we need to sing but those critics of raise are under the same inspiration as Mikkel David's wife they're under the same inspiration today she was critical not necessarily of King David but she was critical of the praise that was due God and it's the same spirit today that brings about an unfruitful life from that point forward Mike Hale never was able to have children because she criticized the worship of God you see not necessarily were they critical are they critical of me or critical of sister can't see a critical brother Donnie or critical of sister Debra but they're critical of the praise that is to God they're not critical of me that critical of the praise that's to the king but you know as I said last night that God is an object of worship and he deserves to be praised he deserves to be worshipped you see the reason why people never change it's because and maybe they've never made a move it's because they have never experienced the god of miracles they never walked him behind the veil and they never walked back there and got rebaptised God she got there got a renewing of their mind and a transformation of the heart they're critical of our praise they're critical of our worship they critical of our dance but as I say before I don't care what the devil don't like I'm gonna praise him with all of my mind if I feel like praising him that's what I'm gonna do if I feel like dancing that's what I'm gonna do if the Spirit of God moves on me to speak in an unknown tongue that's exactly what I'm gonna do you don't like myself my shout it's just matching my miracle if you've seen your taskmaster drowning in the blood of Jesus it would give you something to shout about the reason why you can't shout is because you're still holding on to the chains that are holding you bail you love hanging on to that old dead folk old form of worship you like hanging on to those old hymns that nobody ever moves and they're so quiet that you can hear a Churchmouse moving but I believe that if you ever get to heaven it's going to be loud in heaven and if you go to hell it's gonna be loud inhale hello the reason I worship him it's because the miracle oh yeah somebody's gonna rise up somebody's gonna rise up they say well I'm gonna sit here and I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do I don't care go ahead and do what you gonna do well I'm gonna set home and stream and I'm gonna set home and I I sit here in my recliner drink my sweet tea and eat my popcorn how's that gonna work on resurrection morning stream all you
