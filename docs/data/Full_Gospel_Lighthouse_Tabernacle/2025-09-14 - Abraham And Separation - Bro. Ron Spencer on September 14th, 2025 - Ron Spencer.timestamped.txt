[15:37] be able to sing your praises, Lord, to
[15:40] be able to hear your word,

[16:05] possible, Lord. He just knows he has no
[16:08] time left on this world to try and
[16:10] attack us. So, he's taking every chance
[16:13] he has, Lord. He's taking his greatest
[16:16] attack upon us. But, Lord, it's not
[16:19] going to be enough. It's never going to
[16:20] be enough, Lord. Lord, we just know that
[16:23] all we have to do is call out to your

[16:32] fingers, Lord. You can heal all of these
[16:33] requests, Lord. And Lord, I just thank
[16:36] you, Lord, that you've chosen us, Lord,
[16:39] that you give us this opportunity to be
[16:41] able to come down here, Lord, and just
[16:43] be able to say, "We need you, Lord, more
[16:46] than ever each and every day of our
[16:48] lives."
[16:49] And Lord, I just ask that you have
[16:51] something special in store for us today,
[16:53] Lord. Lord, I'm just expecting, Lord,
[16:57] even just one word today that's going to
[16:59] come down and prick my heart, Lord.
[17:01] Lord, help me to be just a better son of
[17:04] yours each and every day, Lord. And I
[17:06] just thank you for all you do for us.
[17:08] How you bless us, Lord, even when we
[17:10] don't deserve it, Lord. You're such a
[17:12] good God. And Lord, we just love you. We
[17:14] thank you. We just ask it all in the

[21:05] As they gamble for the road before war,
[21:10] they chose the worldly trail
[21:15] without thinking about eternity
[21:20] as the soldiers
[21:22] drove the nails.
[21:25] Will we learn from what they done or
[21:30] make the same mistake?
[21:35] Me or the world, my child, which one

[24:15] [Applause]
[25:02] [Music]
[25:28] Jesus told a story one day about some
[25:33] sand and rock and grain
[25:36] and about two houses and a storm that
[25:41] came. The sand couldn't stand the rain
[25:46] but the house on the rock remained.
[25:54] One day a Pharisee to Jesus brought a
[25:58] woman in adultery caught.
[26:02] That man walked away in the sand,
[26:07] condemned, but the woman's guilt was
[26:10] gone.
[26:12] [Music]
[26:17] Jesus stood for sinners that no one else
[26:22] would stand for.
[26:25] Then he stood at Calvary when we thought
[26:28] he could stand no more.
[26:32] [Music]
[26:44] In the days after Jesus had gone away, a
[26:49] man named Steven was full of faith.
[26:54] But because of men who were full of
[26:58] hate, he went on trial for his faith.
[27:04] [Music]
[27:08] And he fearlessly preached about the
[27:12] days of when the prophets their fathers
[27:16] slain,
[27:18] and how they all rejected the Holy
[27:22] Ghost. even gave his life that day.
[27:28] And that's why we remember his name.
[27:33] Oh, what will you be remembered for?
[27:40] Did you take a stand when you thought
[27:44] you could stand no more?
[27:48] Are you in the rock or in the sand?
[27:56] What will you be remembered for?
[28:01] [Music]
[28:05] All Joshua, Caleb, and Abraham,
[28:09] Enoch, David, Esther, Raab.
[28:14] If the list goes on, will you find your
[28:18] name there? Oh, what will you be
[28:22] remembered for?
[28:27] Are you in the rock or in the sand?
[28:33] Don't forget that God sent us a man.
[28:39] And in the storm, he's there to help you
[28:44] stand.
[28:46] Are you in the rock or in the sand?
[28:51] Oh, don't forget that God sent us a man.
[28:58] And when they've met you, will the world
[29:03] know?
[29:08] What will you be remembered for?
[29:14] Oh, what will you be remembered for?
[29:21] Did you take a stand when you thought
[29:24] you could stand no more?
[29:28] Are you in the rock or in the sand?
[29:36] What will you be remembered for?

[34:54] Aren't you thankful for his love and his
[34:56] peace that passes all understanding?
[34:59] Aren't you thankful for a God that'll
[35:01] forgive you when you fall? And aren't
[35:03] you thankful that he's there to keep you
[35:05] from falling? I say, oh God, pour your
[35:08] mercy out upon us today. Come in a very
[35:11] specific and powerful way this morning
[35:13] as we dedicate this service unto the
[35:15] Lord. Maybe you just want to sit there
[35:17] and lift your hands up to the Lord and
[35:18] say, "God, I need you more today than I
[35:21] ever have before. And I just want to
[35:24] reach out and touch you today. I want
[35:26] you to come by my way and let the winds
[35:28] of the Holy Ghost get in this service
[35:30] and brush over us. Oh God, we dedicate
[35:33] this day to you. Oh God, may you come
[35:36] and anoint our brother Ron in a very
[35:39] special way.
[35:41] And that's what your mercy did for me
[35:48] and every
[35:50] morning.
[35:52] Mercy will restore me. I
[35:59] I will proclaim
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] and even
[36:07] the words fall before me. I
[36:16] will proclaim.
[36:20] Lord, you found me. You heal me. You
[36:24] call me from the grave. You came in your
[36:28] real love. Thank you, Jesus.
[36:32] You wash my sins away.
[36:36] Now I'm living like I'm forgi.
[36:43] Hallelu.
[36:45] And that's what your mercy did for me.
[36:53] And that's what your mercy did for me.
[36:58] Thank you, Lord.
[37:02] And that's what your mercy did for me.
[37:08] Lord God Almighty,
[37:14] you are clotheing man.
[37:18] to sleep.
[37:23] The heavens declare
[37:26] your wonderers.
[37:31] You are great and do marvelous
[37:36] things.
[37:39] For you
[37:42] alone
[37:43] are my God.
[37:46] [Music]
[37:47] There is no
[37:50] one else who like you.
[37:56] Let the nations
[37:59] declare
[38:01] that you
[38:03] you have done great things.
[38:08] Oh mighty you are.
[38:12] Oh
[38:13] you are.
[38:16] Your mercy endureth
[38:19] [Music]
[38:19] [Applause]
[38:20] forever
[38:22] more.
[38:25] For righteous you are.
[38:29] Oh great you are. How will exalt you oh
[38:35] Lord. Oh my God mighty.
[38:42] Oh mighty
[38:43] one.
[38:46] [Music]
[38:59] [Applause]
[39:00] You are
[39:03] praise
[39:05] you
[39:09] [Music]
[39:14] my king.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Is he your king this morning?
[39:21] &gt;&gt; He's not the Lord to you unless you make
[39:24] him
[39:26] &gt;&gt; your Lord.
[39:27] I'm thankful this morning that we can
[39:30] come and worship the Lord here today and
[39:34] and say he's my God
[39:38] &gt;&gt; and there's nobody like him.
[39:42] You know, one service can change our
[39:44] lives.
[39:46] One
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; One service changed my life. I'd been in
[39:51] service all my life to that age,
[39:55] but one service
[39:58] changed my life. Maybe today might be
[40:02] your service. If you're expecting that
[40:05] today, won't you just ask him, "Come
[40:07] near to me today." Amen. Let's pray.
[40:11] Heavenly Father,
[40:13] you're so great and you're so wonderful.
[40:17] You fill all time, space, and eternity.
[40:20] and you know how just to speak to us.
[40:24] I can only imagine how it was when you
[40:27] stood there those days and spoke the
[40:29] biatitudes.
[40:32] [Music]
[40:33] No way for those people to realize how
[40:36] great a moment that they was in.
[40:40] Now, Father, today we're we're just so
[40:43] on the edge of eternity.
[40:46] Help us today,
[40:49] Lord, to step into the realm to where
[40:51] you can speak to us. Now, Father, I ask
[40:54] you to anoint these lips
[40:57] and I ask you to anoint every heart in
[40:59] this building.
[41:01] Lord, this great sickness among us, I
[41:04] pray that you would touch them. Lord,
[41:07] you're the most powerful and you can so
[41:11] gently touch our lives. Come and touch
[41:14] us today.
[41:15] Lord, if there would one be here that
[41:18] don't know you,
[41:20] may before the end of this day, they
[41:23] come to know you as their personal
[41:26] savior in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And
[41:30] amen and amen. Amen. God bless you. God
[41:34] bless you. Turn to your neighbor and
[41:35] say, "Good to be in the house of the
[41:37] Lord with you." And
[41:41] amen.
[41:43] Ain't he wonderful?
[41:45] &gt;&gt; He's just wonderful, isn't he? Amen. So
[41:48] good to see each and every one of you.
[41:49] And Amen. So I'd like to go out and have
[41:52] dinner with you and each we'd sit and
[41:55] talk about our families and our cars. I
[41:58] like that car. I like that. I like that
[42:00] really well.
[42:03] I had one like that when I was a boy.
[42:06] That's how I got Connie.
[42:14] Hallelujah.
[42:16] So good. So today, instead of going out
[42:18] to eat at the table, I want to I want
[42:20] you to pull up yourself to the table
[42:21] today. And we're all friends and family
[42:24] here. And I certainly hope nobody's an
[42:28] enemy. But we're we're we're certainly
[42:30] so love you with all of our hearts. And
[42:33] we're living in very very close times to
[42:36] eternity. And
[42:37] &gt;&gt; if you can't see it, uh, just open your
[42:40] eyes just a little bit.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so this week,
[42:46] a very powerful man was killed. And
[42:49] brother, his name was Charlie Kirk. And
[42:52] Andrew said much about him last night.
[42:55] And I just want to remind you, the
[42:58] scripture talks about two prophets being
[43:00] killed in the streets of Israel.
[43:04] And uh that was thousands of years ago.
[43:07] It talked about it. But you watched a
[43:10] man get killed, a very righteous man
[43:14] &gt;&gt; get killed in the streets
[43:16] &gt;&gt; and hated because he believed in
[43:20] righteousness and
[43:22] &gt;&gt; he believed in and and and he didn't
[43:25] have the message. But I believe there's
[43:27] a place for him somewhere. So
[43:30] &gt;&gt; if the enemy could do that,
[43:34] that same enemy will hate those two
[43:37] prophets,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Moses and Elijah.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; And saying this, the scripture says that
[43:43] they'll be killed in the streets and the
[43:45] whole world will witness it.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Hey, and the prophets, they didn't they
[43:49] didn't know about internet or video or
[43:52] all over the world, but there's cameras
[43:55] everywhere now. And so and so we realize
[43:58] that we're living in the time when
[44:00] everything is being so fulfilled from
[44:03] week to week to week. And
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll turn with me to Genesis
[44:07] chapter 12 and verse one. I want to
[44:10] speak to you on a very simple thought,
[44:12] but it's a very powerful thought. I want
[44:15] to talk to you about Abraham
[44:19] and separation.
[44:22] Amen.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Genesis 12 and verse one. Now the Lord
[44:28] had said unto Abraham, "Get thee out of
[44:31] thy country,
[44:33] and from thy kindred,
[44:36] and from thy father's house, unto a land
[44:39] that I will show thee. And I will make
[44:42] thee a great nation, and I will bless
[44:45] thee, and make thy name great, and thou
[44:49] shalt be a blessing.
[44:51] And I will bless them that bless thee,
[44:54] and curse them that cursseeth thee,
[44:58] and in thee shall all the families of
[45:01] the earth be blessed.
[45:04] And Abram departed as the Lord had
[45:08] spoken unto him.
[45:10] And Lot went with him. And Abram was 705
[45:15] years old when he departed out of Haran.
[45:19] You may be seated.
[45:25] Brother Bram says, "Look at a separation
[45:28] going into a strange land
[45:31] and you know nothing about it." That's
[45:34] Christianity.
[45:36] Separating from the things of the world
[45:39] because God has called you
[45:43] going into another land to dwell among
[45:46] people that you know nothing about.
[45:49] Amen.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; To be a pilgrim. And when I think of it,
[45:53] I can just hardly hold myself.
[45:57] Pilgrim
[45:58] strangers.
[46:02] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 8.
[46:06] And this is the Hall of Fame chapter.
[46:10] And by faith Abraham when he was called
[46:12] to go out into a place that which he was
[46:15] that should after receive for an
[46:17] inheritance
[46:19] obeyed. That's a powerful word.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Obeyed.
[46:27] And he went out, not knowing whether he
[46:29] went. And by faith he sojourned in the
[46:33] land of promise, as in a strange
[46:36] country,
[46:37] dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and
[46:40] Jacob,
[46:41] their heirs with him of the same
[46:44] promise. Notice notice what he his
[46:48] purpose was. He looked for a city
[46:52] which had foundations
[46:54] whose builder and maker is God.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Why would he look for it? He met the
[47:00] king.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Through faith also Sarah herself
[47:06] received strength to conceive seed and
[47:09] was delivered of a child when he was
[47:12] past age because she judged him faithful
[47:18] who had promised.
[47:20] Notice it doesn't say that she doubted,
[47:24] she laughed.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God in the this Hebrews 11,
[47:32] look past all of the human frailties.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that God can look at you
[47:39] like that?
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[47:41] &gt;&gt; it doesn't just say anything about Abram
[47:44] Abraham rolling on the ground laughing
[47:46] at God. Right.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Therefore, spring there even to one and
[47:57] him as a good as dead, so many as the
[48:01] stars of the sky and the multitude, and
[48:04] as the sand that which is by the
[48:06] seashore innumerable.
[48:10] These all died in faith, not having
[48:13] received the promise, but having seen
[48:16] them aar off, and were persuaded of
[48:20] them, and embraced them, and confessed
[48:24] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[48:27] the earth. For they say un such things,
[48:32] declare plainly, that they seek a
[48:35] country. And truly, if they had been
[48:38] mindful of that country from whence they
[48:41] came out, they might have had
[48:44] opportunity to have returned. But now
[48:48] they desire a better country,
[48:53] &gt;&gt; a heavenly.
[48:55] Wherefore God is not ashamed to be their
[48:58] God,
[48:59] for he hath prepared for them a city.
[49:03] And by faith Abraham when he was tried,
[49:06] he he offered Isaac and he had received
[49:10] the promises and offered up his only
[49:12] begotten son. Of whom it was said that
[49:17] in Isaac shall thy seed be called,
[49:20] accounting that God was able to raise
[49:23] him up, even from the dead, from whence
[49:27] also he received him in figure. And may
[49:31] we all say, "Amen." Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Abraham is the father of the faith. I
[49:38] think it's interesting that
[49:41] God calls Abram Abraham his name 300
[49:45] times and 300 different scriptures.
[49:48] And then there's innumerable amount of
[49:51] scriptures that goes with those
[49:53] scriptures. And there's just chapter
[49:56] after chapter, book after book on the
[49:59] life of Abraham. So it's an important
[50:02] part for us.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Give you an idea. We hear about Shamgar.
[50:08] Shamgar kills 600 Philistines.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; One scripture.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; One scripture. There was a name man
[50:20] named Antipus.
[50:22] Antipus is a overcomer.
[50:25] Lived amongst a a place of the seat of
[50:28] Satan is what it said. And he overcame
[50:32] in the darkest place that he could live.
[50:35] One scripture.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ron, but I'm my name.
[50:40] It's not in the scriptures. Not
[50:41] important."
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; It's not important. But you can see
[50:47] yourself
[50:49] &gt;&gt; in the scriptures.
[50:51] Now, I want you to understand some of
[50:54] the most difficult things that Abram
[50:57] would have to do and Abraham would have
[50:59] to do is separate.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Separation's difficult.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand Abram Abraham
[51:10] didn't call himself.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; He's a light like you and I. We didn't
[51:15] call oursel.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; How did we get here? There was something
[51:20] on the inside of us that was not
[51:22] satisfied with where we were.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Maybe you were sitting in a church and
[51:27] you were hearing all different kinds of
[51:29] sermons from this to that and this to
[51:32] that. Maybe under laws, maybe under
[51:34] dictates, maybe under strange religions.
[51:38] But God be to deal with you.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; And in his dealing, he placed a hunger
[51:45] in your heart. There's got to be more.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; There's got to be more.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to remember where
[51:58] Abraham lived, the cities that he lived
[52:00] in,
[52:02] God didn't speak to them,
[52:04] &gt;&gt; but he spoke to one man.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Listen, some of his family would go with
[52:10] him.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; We understand that. But he only spoke to
[52:15] one man. didn't speak to his wife. He
[52:18] spoke to one man.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; God called Abraham. And I want you to
[52:24] understand it must have been a difficult
[52:26] thing.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; It's difficult to separate. I I I I feel
[52:32] for all of us that have to separate from
[52:35] different things. We separate from
[52:37] different kinds of religions. We
[52:39] separate from jobs. We separate from old
[52:42] habits. Sometimes we have to separate
[52:45] from family.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Listen. As for me, in
[52:50] my house, we're going to serve the Lord.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we're going to do.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; That's our plan. Our our home is our
[52:59] sanctuary. And I want you to understand,
[53:02] we don't want the world to contaminate
[53:06] that sanctuary.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. So Abraham has to separate
[53:12] from all of these things. God called
[53:15] him,
[53:17] but Abraham had to separate.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; God don't do it everything for you.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; There's some things that you've got to
[53:26] overcome.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Now, many of us had habits in our life
[53:30] or situations in our life and we had to
[53:33] lay it down.
[53:38] Are you with me? We had to leave it
[53:40] behind. Listen, there's a lot of things
[53:43] we're going to leave here.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Now, separation
[53:48] causes us to have to leave our comfort
[53:51] zone.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Everybody enjoys a certain comfort zone.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We enjoy a certain things in our life
[54:01] and comfort zone. And God calls us out
[54:04] from that.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; He separates us from that.
[54:09] Now, I want you to just think about
[54:11] this.
[54:13] Maybe maybe I'll just share this part.
[54:16] Brother Andrew was speaking on the Holy
[54:18] Ghost last night. Wasn't that wonderful?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; You know, and maybe we come in our life
[54:23] and I'll just share some of my personal
[54:24] experience. Brother Bram shares
[54:28] just thousands of quotes on the Holy
[54:30] Ghost. But you know, you're seeking the
[54:33] Holy Ghost and you know that you can't
[54:35] live it without it.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; You know I can't live this life on my
[54:41] own. That's
[54:42] &gt;&gt; right.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, Brother Ron, I I could
[54:45] live right if you come and live with
[54:47] me."
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't need that because you
[54:52] got God.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; You got way above way above my pay
[54:57] grade. You got God with you. That's
[54:59] right.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; And so we need the life of God. We don't
[55:03] need a a bunch of loss.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We don't want to just
[55:08] live right here in church.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; And and put on a different cloak on
[55:12] Monday morning.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; We need the personal life of Jesus
[55:17] Christ,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; living on the inside of us.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham would want that that
[55:24] circumcision. He would want that that
[55:26] change in his life. for him to be
[55:29] different.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand every one of us
[55:32] have different experience.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; We can't mark our experience by by
[55:38] another. God gives you like your eyes
[55:41] and your fingerprints is a is a
[55:44] different signature about you.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; Nobody else is like you.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Every one of us,
[55:51] &gt;&gt; right? That's right.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Gets a different experience with the
[55:54] personal life of Jesus Christ. That's
[55:57] right.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Some of us shout. Some of us dance. Some
[56:00] of us cry.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Some of us do different things.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Many sensations. You heard brother Wayne
[56:09] talk about seeing the pillar of fire
[56:11] coming across the platform to him while
[56:14] he was down at the altar.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe nobody else on the earth has ever
[56:19] had that experience.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say this to
[56:25] you. You're not going to have lightning
[56:27] hit you.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; I had lightning hit me. Didn't like it.
[56:31] Don't want it to ever happen again.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; But I didn't receive the Holy Ghost with
[56:36] the lightning strike.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Some of it will come immediately. Some
[56:43] you're going to have to tarry for it.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; And in the taring for the Holy Ghost,
[56:50] you just keep praying.
[56:53] You just keep dying out to your flesh.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; You just keep marching onward.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You just keep serving the Lord. Are you
[57:03] with me?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Don't ever get to a part to where God
[57:06] don't love me. I can't get it. I'm just
[57:09] never going. Don't let the devil beat
[57:11] you around the stick.
[57:21] You have a desire for the Holy Ghost.
[57:23] That only tells you there's a Holy Ghost
[57:25] for you.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That only tells you
[57:28] there's a Holy Ghost for you.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You've repented. You've been baptized in
[57:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:38] You're a candidate for the Holy Ghost.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And it's a promise to you.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Now listen, you don't have to beg for
[57:44] it.
[57:46] You don't have to beg God for it. It's a
[57:49] gift.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; So you just thank him for it.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; So in your thanksgiving, are you with me
[57:57] now? Season your prayer with
[58:00] thanksgiving.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you've got to thank God for
[58:06] something that you don't have.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You got to thank him
[58:11] for things that you don't have because
[58:14] the potential is there for you.
[58:18] [Applause]
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just share this to you. Your
[58:24] your young ones here.
[58:27] Every time,
[58:29] and I'll just ask you, you can raise
[58:31] your hand. You've been in a room or
[58:33] you've been in your car
[58:36] and you feel a warm presence just come
[58:40] in.
[58:42] It's like somebody walked in the room.
[58:45] How many's ever had that experience?
[58:48] You've just been maybe alone and you
[58:51] just feel that warm presence. Well, let
[58:54] me just share this with you.
[58:56] Every time he comes, no matter your age,
[58:59] no matter how long you've been a
[59:00] Christian,
[59:02] while he is there,
[59:06] you have a conversation with him.
[59:10] Father,
[59:11] I need more of you.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I need more of you.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; You need to You need to get rid of
[59:20] something. You need to repent of
[59:21] something. Right. There's a good time.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Oh, but brother Ron, I'm
[59:25] gonna have to tell him a thought. He
[59:27] already knows.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Let me give you a secret. God already
[59:32] knows all your nonsense.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; But in spite of your nonsense, he still
[59:37] loves you.
[59:40] [Applause]
[59:48] &gt;&gt; So ask him, feel my life. Well, brother,
[59:52] I got the Holy Ghost in 1982. Well, let
[59:54] me just say this. You there's more for
[59:56] you today.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; I like iced tea. But I want you to
[1:00:00] understand my cup runs out.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; So, you're going to have to pour some
[1:00:04] more in. Are you with me? We heard about
[1:00:07] him last night making the jug and
[1:00:09] putting a hand on it. Sometimes you got
[1:00:11] to put your hand on it. Get your get
[1:00:12] your cup filled back up. Right.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Now, now let me just share this with
[1:00:20] you.
[1:00:22] Maybe your friends are not wanting this,
[1:00:25] but that's okay. Everybody's a free
[1:00:27] moral agency. But just because your
[1:00:29] friends don't want to go, you got to go.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; God put something in you, you got to
[1:00:35] separate. Are you with me now?
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; I let me just explain something to you.
[1:00:41] Who is my friends?
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:45] who is really my friends. We all have to
[1:00:48] work with people. I've been in business
[1:00:49] since I was 13 years old. We always have
[1:00:52] to work with people of the world.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; We got friends there that we call
[1:00:58] friends or partners or or alliances in
[1:01:02] business.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; We've all got different things that
[1:01:07] we've got going on. But that don't make
[1:01:10] them your eternal friends.
[1:01:15] Are you with me? Or your eternal
[1:01:16] associates.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; What's the difference, brother Ron? If
[1:01:24] they're drawing you heavenward
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; and you're both on the same path,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; and you both love the Lord Jesus and the
[1:01:35] message of the hour,
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; that's a good idea that they're a
[1:01:39] friend.
[1:01:41] But if you've got a friend that's a drug
[1:01:43] head,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; a friend that never wants to go to
[1:01:48] church or does not want to serve God and
[1:01:51] listen to all kind of music,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; there must come a separation in your
[1:01:57] life.
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:08] Now you say, "Well, brother Ron, there's
[1:02:11] things in my life."
[1:02:15] I'm laying all all this in before I can
[1:02:17] go any further. There's things in my
[1:02:20] life that's there in my DNA
[1:02:24] that that's there that I have to
[1:02:27] struggle with. I I I let me just let me
[1:02:30] just talk to you a moment.
[1:02:33] God is the potter.
[1:02:40] God is the potter.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; We are the clay.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Whether you realize it or not, we're
[1:02:49] still on the spinning wheel.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We're still on the
[1:02:57] spinning wheel. God's not going to
[1:02:58] change your character in the rapture.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; He's got to do it right here. Cuz
[1:03:06] there's not going to be a liar there or
[1:03:07] a cheater there or a robber there. Are
[1:03:09] you with me now?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Or a lustful demon there. There's not
[1:03:13] going to be none of that in heaven.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Because it if it is there, it ain't
[1:03:18] heaven.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; There not going to be no blue-haired
[1:03:23] people there.
[1:03:26] All right.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; It will not be Sodom there.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; It will not be Sodom there.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Let me let me I'm sorry. Let me just go
[1:03:47] back to you. Your minds are perpetually
[1:03:53] social media is constantly after you.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Constantly sending you images and
[1:03:59] constantly sending you like, dislike.
[1:04:03] Friends, be my friend. Be my friend. Let
[1:04:06] me let me just say this to you real
[1:04:08] quickly. So you said, "Brother Ron, I
[1:04:10] want you to be my friend. I don't have
[1:04:12] Facebook
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; and I don't have all of the other stuff.
[1:04:17] So if you want a friend request from me,
[1:04:19] ah,
[1:04:23] I'm being your friend right now.
[1:04:27] [Applause]
[1:04:37] So, so when you see friends
[1:04:42] send you pictures and they're in a
[1:04:44] bathing suit, don't like it.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Simply don't like it cuz that says I
[1:04:54] approve.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And they're in their booty shorts. don't
[1:05:00] like it.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Or if they're a girlfriend and they're a
[1:05:04] girl, don't like it.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; And it's so easy to be caught up.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; So easy to be caught up with this laying
[1:05:19] deceitful age.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; That's free. It wasn't in my notes, but
[1:05:29] there we are.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; So, God takes us and we're on the
[1:05:32] molding wheel. Brother Brandham was a
[1:05:35] very honest man with us. He would talk
[1:05:37] to us about his nervousness. Brother B
[1:05:41] was nervous from a little bitty boy to
[1:05:44] to even to his death. And he was very he
[1:05:47] was very quick to tell us about his
[1:05:49] complexes. I thought she was preaching
[1:05:51] on Abraham. I am.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; I am. Abraham had complexes. He had he
[1:05:59] had things in his life. Well, quickly
[1:06:03] tell me, brother Ron, that Abraham had a
[1:06:05] didn't have a complex or had a complex.
[1:06:08] Okay. They go to Greer and the the the
[1:06:11] the king and Greer wants his wife. And
[1:06:15] notice what he says. Don't tell him
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; you're my wife.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Tell him you're my sister. Right.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Brother Brandham said
[1:06:27] he was saving his own skin.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; So Abraham had complexes.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; So we're built in a certain way that
[1:06:40] we're going to have to battle our self.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, brother Ron, why
[1:06:46] does God in our supernatural birth don't
[1:06:49] change the complex of our life?" It's
[1:06:52] because God wants the bell to sound a
[1:06:55] certain way
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; and he puts certain elements in your
[1:07:01] life to keep you
[1:07:05] from getting bigheaded
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and thinking you're so special. There's
[1:07:10] nobody like you and the world couldn't
[1:07:13] exist unless it was revolving around
[1:07:16] you. I got news for you, sweetheart.
[1:07:20] Come on.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; The world don't revolve around me. It
[1:07:25] revolves around the sun.
[1:07:29] [Applause]
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; My dad had the complex or my dad had the
[1:07:42] thought.
[1:07:45] You ever heard that song rainy night in
[1:07:47] Georgia?
[1:07:49] It must be raining all over the world.
[1:07:52] Well, my dad thought if it was raining
[1:07:55] at his house.
[1:07:58] You might know somebody like that. But
[1:08:00] if it was raining at his house, it ought
[1:08:03] to be raining all over the world.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; I got a reason for saying this. Just
[1:08:11] because a cloud was over his house
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; and was pouring out,
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; thank God for the rain.
[1:08:19] But not necessarily was it raining at my
[1:08:22] house.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; So sweetheart, just because there's a
[1:08:25] cloud of depression over you don't mean
[1:08:28] it over top of me.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you were kind of off the
[1:08:44] scripture. Okay.
[1:08:47] 2 Corinthians chapter 12
[1:08:51] and I want to read this for you. It is
[1:08:53] not expedient for me to be doubtless to
[1:08:55] glory. I will come to visions and
[1:08:57] revelations of the Lord. This is Paul
[1:08:59] now. I knew a man in Christ above 14
[1:09:02] years ago. Whether in the body I cannot
[1:09:05] tell, or whether out of the body, I
[1:09:06] cannot tell. God knoweth such one caught
[1:09:10] up into the third heaven. I knew such a
[1:09:12] man. Whether in the body or out of the
[1:09:15] body, I cannot tell. God knoweth. Notice
[1:09:19] Paul was not in control.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; It was up to God.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; How that he was caught up into the
[1:09:28] paradise and heard unspeakable words
[1:09:30] which is not lawful for a man to utter.
[1:09:34] Of such a one
[1:09:36] of such a one will I glory. Yet of
[1:09:40] myself I will not glory. but in my
[1:09:43] infirmities.
[1:09:44] For though I would desire to glory, I
[1:09:47] shall not be a fool.
[1:09:51] For I will say the truth, but now I
[1:09:54] forbear.
[1:09:55] Lest, notice these words.
[1:09:59] Let's just read this together. It's too
[1:10:01] good to leave it alone. Lest any man
[1:10:05] should think of me above that which he
[1:10:08] seeth me to be, or that he heareth of
[1:10:11] me. Let's go ahead and read the next
[1:10:13] verse. Unless I should be exalted above
[1:10:17] measure through the abundance of
[1:10:20] revelations,
[1:10:21] there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:10:24] flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet
[1:10:28] me, lest I should get exalted above
[1:10:31] measure.
[1:10:36] I don't like myself. Well, hello.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; I'd like to be taller.
[1:10:44] But it wasn't in my DNA cards.
[1:10:49] So, lest I get exalted in my flesh above
[1:10:53] me, this is a prophet.
[1:10:56] This is the guy that's going to write 14
[1:10:59] books of the Bible.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Phenomenal words is going to come
[1:11:06] through his preaching. You talk about
[1:11:09] miracles above measure. And yet there
[1:11:12] was given him a thorn in the flesh
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; to keep him.
[1:11:22] God knows how to keep us all humble.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Hey, listen. We're We're all We're all
[1:11:32] humans here.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Wayne told us about angels that
[1:11:36] had wings. He said, "Huge wings."
[1:11:41] And and what an honor that would have
[1:11:43] been to see.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; But we don't have a wing department
[1:11:47] here.
[1:11:54] So, Brother Brandham was brother
[1:11:57] Brandham was standing. He had people
[1:11:59] that was around him, too. And he was
[1:12:01] standing shaking people's hands as they
[1:12:03] were going out of the service. And they
[1:12:05] were telling him, "What a great service.
[1:12:08] What a great sermon. What a great
[1:12:09] sermon. What a great sermon." And he was
[1:12:11] thanking them and thanking them and and
[1:12:13] he was thanking them and and you know,
[1:12:16] you know, it made him happy to hear it.
[1:12:18] Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; And so and so and so a man was standing
[1:12:22] beside him and he rebuked Brother
[1:12:24] Brandham.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; He rebuked Brother Brand. Can you
[1:12:28] imagine rebuking Brother Brand standing
[1:12:30] in the in the judgment line and you're
[1:12:34] there because you rebuked the prophet.
[1:12:37] And so
[1:12:39] and Brother Brandham looked at I I think
[1:12:41] it's a I think it's so sharp of an
[1:12:43] answer.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He looked at him. He said, "There's a
[1:12:46] difference between you and I.
[1:12:48] I'm honest and you're not.
[1:12:53] You're talking about a pin and a
[1:12:55] balloon."
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; I'm honest and you're not.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand, Brother
[1:13:03] Brandham was a man like me and you.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; He he he loved he loved people.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; He loved our sisters. And yet, he was
[1:13:12] termed a woman hater. Come on.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; The world wanted to determine that. They
[1:13:17] termed Elijah a woman hater. They'll
[1:13:19] turn the Elijah in Israel a woman hater.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; They will. But Brother Brandham loved
[1:13:26] you sisters. And he put you on a
[1:13:29] pinnacle. Said you'll actually get a
[1:13:31] greater reward than us men.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham didn't didn't go down
[1:13:39] and push women down. He lifted them up.
[1:13:42] Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; You're queens. You're the pastor of the
[1:13:45] home.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You have a quality about you
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; in all of that that he heard all of
[1:13:54] that. And yet there was groups of people
[1:13:57] that wanted to offer brother Bram
[1:14:01] millions of dollars to preach in their
[1:14:04] circle.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; But they had a they had a a little
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; a little rope on it.
[1:14:12] And you're going to have to quit
[1:14:13] preaching against those women.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to you put too much
[1:14:22] emphasis on on on baptism in the name of
[1:14:25] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:14:27] You know, you he said he said, "You just
[1:14:32] need to give them teach us some
[1:14:33] algebra." and he and qu just easily
[1:14:36] says, "How can I teach you algebra when
[1:14:39] you don't even know your ABCs?"
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham wasn't a rich man.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; He was not a rich man. Voice of God's
[1:14:50] rich, but brother Brandham wasn't rich.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was a poor guy. There
[1:14:57] was many of his hunting trips that he
[1:14:59] goes on that was sponsored.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; They took care of him. But I want you to
[1:15:04] understand I want you to understand
[1:15:05] brother Brandham
[1:15:08] could have used a million dollars.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; What an offer that it was.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; But it called for separation.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It comes with a cost.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; You think I've been rambling, but I've
[1:15:26] actually been going quite on my notes
[1:15:28] real well.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; When it comes to separation, you must
[1:15:33] never go back.
[1:15:36] [Applause]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; When it comes to separation, you may in
[1:15:40] your heart of hearts or in your
[1:15:42] thoughts. Well, I miss that. What do you
[1:15:45] miss?
[1:15:48] If you were a smoker or if you were a
[1:15:50] drinker, you got more brain cells now
[1:15:52] than you had before.
[1:15:56] You definitely got more character than
[1:15:58] what you had before. And I know you got
[1:16:01] better friends than what you had before.
[1:16:03] Why would you want to go back?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Why would you want to go back to the
[1:16:12] lifestyle of chasing the wrong kind of
[1:16:14] women
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; when God gave you a good wife?
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; I'm going to hit something solid here.
[1:16:21] Why would you going to want to go back
[1:16:23] to porn?
[1:16:26] when you got a godly wife
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; that is a treasure in heaven.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Why would you want to look at some one
[1:16:36] pervert on a you don't even know if
[1:16:38] that's a woman or a man?
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; That's somebody's daughter. That's
[1:16:45] somebody else's wife. And you're sending
[1:16:48] your soul to hell
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; for a lustful spirit that you're
[1:16:53] feeding.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; How do I get a spirit to die? Don't feed
[1:16:59] it.
[1:17:01] [Applause]
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; The best way to to keep a habit going in
[1:17:14] your life is just keep feeding that
[1:17:16] thing.
[1:17:23] when I worked at the Arsenal.
[1:17:28] One of my supervisors died this week and
[1:17:31] I thought about it. He's a wonderful
[1:17:33] fellow. I enjoyed 11 years with him
[1:17:37] and uh
[1:17:40] had a lot of conversations with him and
[1:17:44] I was asked was I going to go to his
[1:17:46] funeral.
[1:17:48] I gave it thought. I thought real quick.
[1:17:51] I'd rather be here preaching.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Brother, didn't you like him? Didn't you
[1:17:58] love him? Sure I did.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But we're headed two different places.
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:14] So sometimes there comes separation
[1:18:22] in Romans chapter 4
[1:18:25] and verse 16.
[1:18:31] Therefore, it is of faith that it might
[1:18:33] be of grace,
[1:18:36] to the end the promise might be sure to
[1:18:40] all seed,
[1:18:42] not to that only which is of the law,
[1:18:45] but to that also which is the faith of
[1:18:48] Abraham,
[1:18:50] who is the father of us all.
[1:18:53] As it is written,
[1:18:56] I have made thee a father of nations. I
[1:18:59] want you to understand it is that you
[1:19:01] have made yourself a father of nations.
[1:19:04] God did it
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; before him who only he believed even God
[1:19:13] who quickenth the dead and calleth those
[1:19:16] things which be not as though they were.
[1:19:20] Notice this next verse. who against hope
[1:19:23] believed in hope,
[1:19:25] that he might become the father of many
[1:19:28] nations, according to that which was
[1:19:31] spoken, so shall thy seed be.
[1:19:38] What a powerful what a powerful
[1:19:40] scripture. Abraham did not know who he
[1:19:43] was.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; God had to lead him
[1:19:49] to who he was. Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Now, can you imagine the thoughts? Where
[1:19:54] are you going, Abraham?
[1:19:57] I don't know.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Well, show me a map. I I
[1:20:05] can't show you a map. I don't know what
[1:20:09] kind of a voice you listening to. The
[1:20:12] voice that's anchored in my heart
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; that I know that voice is real.
[1:20:18] Why do you pass all of these churches to
[1:20:20] go to that church?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz I know it's real.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; It changed my life.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; It changed my life. Brother David, this
[1:20:39] changed your life. Yeah,
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; there's sometimes you can't explain how
[1:20:44] it happened
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; cuz it wasn't even you that wanted to be
[1:20:48] here.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You may have been convinced to be here,
[1:20:52] but here you are.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; I I I don't know, brother
[1:21:00] John Stemon. How many of you ever heard
[1:21:02] brother John Stemon's?
[1:21:04] Brother John was a he was quite a friend
[1:21:07] of mine. I became a bosom buddy to him.
[1:21:10] Brother Danny Steman's father,
[1:21:13] brother John absolutely hated this
[1:21:15] message with all his heart. I'm talking
[1:21:19] about everything in him hated this
[1:21:22] message.
[1:21:24] Well, so happened he had married one of
[1:21:26] the most precious sisters of this
[1:21:28] message.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And her mother had been a a lady that
[1:21:34] worked in a home for brother and sister
[1:21:36] Dao.
[1:21:38] her mother had cancer
[1:21:41] and so brother Brandham had came over to
[1:21:43] visit and and you know she's a Menanite
[1:21:47] and so you know she's
[1:21:50] you know kind of becoming acquainted
[1:21:52] with brother Brandham's ministry and and
[1:21:54] she's sitting behind a door and and just
[1:21:58] kind of listening and brother Brandham
[1:22:01] is speaking on the other side of the
[1:22:03] door to the people in the room and he
[1:22:06] starts telling a story.
[1:22:09] And in the story, he explains brother
[1:22:12] Danny's grandmother and the cancer that
[1:22:15] she's got. And in the story, she finds
[1:22:19] out he's talking about me and I'm not
[1:22:23] even in the room.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you're sitting in a service
[1:22:30] and you realize, "Hey, he's talking
[1:22:32] about me."
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, he's talking about
[1:22:35] me.
[1:22:39] So her and her daughter come to become
[1:22:42] converted to the message of the hour.
[1:22:44] Saints
[1:22:46] John hated it. He would come and blow
[1:22:50] his horn outside the meet. Can you
[1:22:52] imagine how obnoxious that was? Our
[1:22:55] deacons would go nuts.
[1:23:00] Brother John took message books and
[1:23:04] throw them in the river.
[1:23:06] What happened? River dried up.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; You can't make this stuff up.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Brother John moved her over and over
[1:23:16] again. And he moved into California. Got
[1:23:19] up in the mountains where he thought
[1:23:21] nobody. And Brother Brandham's down in
[1:23:23] the hill country. He's down He's down in
[1:23:25] the city preaching. And he said, "God's
[1:23:27] got some of my children up there in
[1:23:30] those mountains.
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:41] He moves her to Florida in Menanite
[1:23:44] country
[1:23:45] surrounded by Menanites.
[1:23:49] This should come, this comes to some
[1:23:51] some of you guys. You know, you're
[1:23:53] surrounded by Amish people. Don't worry,
[1:23:55] you're the light,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; brother. You're preaching on separation.
[1:24:01] Yeah, I am. I'm talking about you. You
[1:24:04] had to separate and it's painful. We had
[1:24:06] to separate and it's painful.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; He moves her to Florida. She's going to
[1:24:11] a baptismal service. I'm going to just
[1:24:14] tell you the best recolation
[1:24:16] recolleation I have. And so she says,
[1:24:18] "I'm going to a baptismal service." He
[1:24:20] gets so mad. They're living in a house
[1:24:23] that just has those circles. I always
[1:24:25] love those houses that got a circle. I
[1:24:27] got one now. Brother Jim took a door,
[1:24:30] put in a room, and now we got a circle
[1:24:31] that can run around that house. Every
[1:24:34] once in a while, I'll just take off,
[1:24:35] run, run around all the way around the
[1:24:36] house.
[1:24:39] Why? I don't know.
[1:24:47] Brother John got so mad. He kept making
[1:24:49] circles.
[1:24:53] And she's standing there and she's just
[1:24:55] praying. She's just a she's a queen of a
[1:24:57] lady. And she's standing there just
[1:24:59] praying and and one of the circles he
[1:25:02] stopped and said, "I'm going with you."
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; She went, "Oh my Lord, he's going to be
[1:25:08] a disturbance."
[1:25:12] And he wound up at the baptismal
[1:25:14] service. And you know what he did? He
[1:25:17] walked right into that water and he got
[1:25:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:22] Christ.
[1:25:26] You're talking about a separation.
[1:25:37] A guy that went polar opposite to
[1:25:40] preaching this message. He developed a
[1:25:43] sermon, a 60se secondond sermon.
[1:25:49] And in that 60 seconds, he would preach
[1:25:52] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:25:53] Christ, salvation, and Malachi 4:5 and
[1:25:57] 6. And where he did it at was at a red
[1:25:59] light.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I see some of these people
[1:26:04] sitting on the corner and they got help
[1:26:05] wanted or, you know, I'm I'm hungry or
[1:26:08] I'm all of this and I got a lot of
[1:26:10] doubts when he does that.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; But here's brother John Steammon
[1:26:14] standing on a corner and preaching to a
[1:26:16] captive audience.
[1:26:20] for 60 seconds and they would go through
[1:26:23] and then stop again and 60 seconds and
[1:26:26] they would go through and 60 seconds and
[1:26:29] they would go through. Did it work?
[1:26:31] Well, he got a son-in-law out of it.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; And Bill Hersburgger and and Tom Ber
[1:26:41] walked up to him
[1:26:44] and they're standing there listening to
[1:26:45] the sermon over and over and over again.
[1:26:47] Hey, they're Amish and Menite and
[1:26:51] they're standing there listening to this
[1:26:53] man. They don't know he came from that.
[1:26:57] They're standing there listening to this
[1:26:59] and they accepted the Lord. Brother Bill
[1:27:02] is was his son-in-law and an associate
[1:27:05] pastor now. And brother Tom Baler was
[1:27:08] just here sat right there. His wife had
[1:27:10] cancer, delivered,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Going to be here in January preaching
[1:27:16] for us. But God called for separation.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. God will get his own.
[1:27:25] [Applause]
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Who are hope?
[1:27:41] believed in hope
[1:27:44] that he might become the father of many
[1:27:48] nations.
[1:27:50] Can you imagine once God calls him out,
[1:27:53] God speaks to him and he says,
[1:27:56] "Count in the sand."
[1:27:59] You can't count the sand. So the shall
[1:28:01] thy seed be.
[1:28:04] Count the stars.
[1:28:06] I can't count the stars. It's God's
[1:28:09] first Bible. I can't count them. So
[1:28:12] shall thy seed be.
[1:28:14] I was thinking about this morning. I
[1:28:16] just about had myself a shot and fit.
[1:28:19] There's going to be a day that Abraham's
[1:28:23] going to stand in the eternities.
[1:28:26] And for the first time,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; he saw it in potential
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; and for the first time, he's going to
[1:28:34] see us all together.
[1:28:46] Maybe you're on the fence. Maybe you're
[1:28:47] on the internet and you're on the fence.
[1:28:49] You don't know if you can make it once
[1:28:50] in a You can't You can't see your own
[1:28:52] potential. You can't see where God's
[1:28:54] leading you. Don't you worry. You trust
[1:28:56] God.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You trust God. God sees what's on the
[1:29:02] inside of you.
[1:29:09] Now,
[1:29:10] I'm not going to read it because I'm
[1:29:12] running out of time,
[1:29:14] but Abraham brings his father, and there
[1:29:16] comes a time where he has to separate
[1:29:18] from his father. I know that had to be
[1:29:21] difficult.
[1:29:23] There comes a time when God's dealing
[1:29:25] with him and speaking to him, and
[1:29:28] sacrifices are being made.
[1:29:31] Now God has changed his name from Abram
[1:29:34] to Abraham,
[1:29:38] breathed his own life inside of him,
[1:29:42] placed his own attributes. That's not
[1:29:44] today's sermon. But there comes a time
[1:29:46] that he has a a nephew
[1:29:49] whom he dearly loves
[1:29:51] that has been with him through the
[1:29:53] journey. I'll be really honest with you.
[1:29:55] When you walk with God, God will bless
[1:29:57] you.
[1:30:01] Let me let me just say some of you make
[1:30:02] some incredible sacrifices, but don't
[1:30:05] you worry, God pays his debt.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He pays his debt.
[1:30:11] There'll be a time that you can't afford
[1:30:12] gas in your car, but don't you worry,
[1:30:14] God pays his debt.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Abram, when you read about Lot getting
[1:30:21] in trouble, he had 300 and some 300 and
[1:30:25] some male servants that went to fight
[1:30:31] He had 300 some employees
[1:30:35] and he started the journey by himself
[1:30:38] and God was now in the middle of a
[1:30:41] basically a desert place and he's being
[1:30:45] so blessed I have to have 300 and some
[1:30:49] employee males not counting the females
[1:30:52] and not counting the children and not
[1:30:53] counting the animals.
[1:30:57] Sometimes we get the idea that Abraham
[1:30:59] was out there and he was he was just he
[1:31:01] was mothed and he was just totally
[1:31:03] broke. That's not our God.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You got the wrong picture of God.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; God says, "I will bless you."
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, I'm not passing another
[1:31:15] offering plate here.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; God said, "I will bless you." You got to
[1:31:20] believe for it.
[1:31:23] And I want you to understand, you got to
[1:31:24] work for it.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Two hands, two feet work.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; But there comes a time to where
[1:31:37] their independent herds
[1:31:40] became too great for the land.
[1:31:45] And to be honest with you, two can't
[1:31:48] walk together
[1:31:50] except they be agreed.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; So he went to God. What must I do?
[1:32:05] God gave him instructions. Separate.
[1:32:09] And the instructions says if he chooses
[1:32:11] this way or he chooses that way. And I'm
[1:32:12] paraphrasing now. You go the other way.
[1:32:17] And there's going to be times in your
[1:32:18] life to where your closest closest
[1:32:22] is going to believe certain things. It's
[1:32:25] going to take them right out of the
[1:32:26] message. It's going to be difficult,
[1:32:31] but you simply got to walk away.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; So Lot
[1:32:42] They have a meeting, have a conference,
[1:32:47] and he says, "Let there be no strife
[1:32:48] among us. Let's don't don't Let's stop
[1:32:51] the strife. That's not eternal.
[1:32:55] Let's stop that.
[1:32:58] Let's stop that."
[1:33:01] And he said, "You choose which way
[1:33:04] you'll go, and I'll go the other way."
[1:33:09] Abraham was the Christian of it all.
[1:33:12] Now watch Lot.
[1:33:14] Brother Brandon says, "Lot looked at all
[1:33:17] the possibilities
[1:33:20] that was down in Sodom. Saw the
[1:33:23] wellwatered grass that was there.
[1:33:26] He saw all of those possib
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; he never thought that those Sodom
[1:33:34] conditions would affect his home.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you allow a demon in and you
[1:33:40] don't realize there's seven worse that's
[1:33:42] coming.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I can get by with this. Really?
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Other people get by with it, but they
[1:33:51] not may not be seen.
[1:33:56] Well, that you know the this church does
[1:33:58] it this way and they they wear they wear
[1:34:00] their shorts, they bob their hair, they
[1:34:02] they may not be
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; good on a on by biblical terms, we know
[1:34:11] they're not
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; we're not all headed the same way.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; So don't justify yourself by a picture.
[1:34:22] Amen.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Or somebody lowering the rules just
[1:34:26] because of their their
[1:34:30] lust or their willingness to let the
[1:34:33] bars down.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; And so Abraham let him go.
[1:34:42] That's when God really begin to bless
[1:34:45] Abraham.
[1:34:48] God would not come in physical form to
[1:34:51] Abraham until Lot left.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody following me?
[1:35:00] Now, here's where we're beginning to
[1:35:01] come to where we're at now.
[1:35:05] As it was in the days of Noah, so shall
[1:35:09] it be in the coming of the Son of Man.
[1:35:11] As it was in the days of Lot, so shall
[1:35:14] it be in the coming of the Son of Man.
[1:35:16] When I hear brother Brandham preach
[1:35:18] souls now in prison, can you imagine
[1:35:22] if he would go to our local Walmart,
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; what he saw in JC Penney reminded him of
[1:35:29] what was in hell.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; If the headlines
[1:35:34] that he would see of what we see on a a
[1:35:37] daily basis, he could see now being the
[1:35:40] messenger as a seer could realize where
[1:35:44] we're headed. He could see that we're
[1:35:46] headed over the ca cascades, not of the
[1:35:48] na niagra, but we're headed over the
[1:35:50] cascades of time and eternity.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; The end of the gentile dispensation.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Ron, but we're going to be
[1:36:00] here forever.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; I was going to save this for another,
[1:36:05] but I might as well just drop a couple
[1:36:07] things right here. Have you watched the
[1:36:08] news this week at all?
[1:36:12] Russia says that we're already in World
[1:36:15] War II.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Is this mic working?
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Russia and their prime minister and
[1:36:26] their military leader this week said,
[1:36:30] "We're already in World War II."
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Why should America be surprised when we
[1:36:37] went into Poland?
[1:36:41] I'm afraid too many people's got their
[1:36:43] head in the sand.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We are here, folks.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; We're here, folks. And I'm coming to an
[1:36:54] end. We're here, folks.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; God save America. I'm a I'm afraid.
[1:37:02] Brother Bram says you could put a George
[1:37:03] Washington and an Abraham Lincoln in
[1:37:06] every county
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; and it wouldn't change it.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I don't know if he
[1:37:20] was right on that. Did you see Charlie
[1:37:22] Kirk get killed?
[1:37:25] a good man that was trying to speak
[1:37:28] righteousness and Bible principles and
[1:37:31] tried to do it the right way to our
[1:37:33] young people.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; He wasn't militant. He never he got mad.
[1:37:37] He never done all of those things. He
[1:37:39] was trying to bring righteousness to the
[1:37:41] colleges. He was trying to do different
[1:37:42] things.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Listen, pray for his family.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Got a lovely wife and lovely children.
[1:37:53] They didn't deserve to see their daddy.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; What did you do when you when you saw
[1:38:02] that take place this week? I cried.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; I personally cried cuz that tells me how
[1:38:10] close we are.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; They don't want clean television.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; They don't want clean movies. Come on.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; They don't want real righteous
[1:38:22] politicians.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; They don't want it.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; I don't care where you're Democrat or
[1:38:31] Republican.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care. They're all rotten.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:48] What does this mean, brother Ron?
[1:38:49] There's another separation coming.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 25, it talks about
[1:38:56] five wise and five foolish.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. The five wise had all which is the
[1:39:04] Holy Ghost in their lamp. So, were
[1:39:07] brother Ron, was brother Andrew's sermon
[1:39:09] so important? Listen, it's pivotal
[1:39:11] important
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; that you have the Holy Ghost
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; because it's your token.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You cannot go in the rapture without the
[1:39:21] Holy Ghost.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You can sit on this seat the rest of
[1:39:26] your life without the Holy Ghost. You'll
[1:39:29] not make a rapture. I'm sorry.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; You can be in my family, but you've got
[1:39:34] to have the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:36] And listen, that's why we're preaching
[1:39:38] so hard because God's put us in our
[1:39:41] heart. We don't want to see one,
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; not one lost.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; There was five, five wise.
[1:40:01] And at midnight, there was a cry made.
[1:40:03] And the five foolish was there as well.
[1:40:06] All of them slumbered and slept.
[1:40:09] The five foolish didn't have oil.
[1:40:14] The five foolish needed the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:20] I want you to understand
[1:40:22] those five foolish
[1:40:24] are not manhandled.
[1:40:26] Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; They're good people.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; They're really good people.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; They're righteous people.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; They're powerful prayer warriors.
[1:40:41] They're in the kingdom,
[1:40:44] but they're not ready for rapture.
[1:40:48] Is this message important, Brother Ron?
[1:40:50] It's a ticket.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; It's a ticket.
[1:41:01] foolish screaming. Give us of your all.
[1:41:05] I got to have the life. I got to have
[1:41:08] the life. I got to have the life. Now,
[1:41:12] let me just say something to you.
[1:41:14] I'm going over time, but let me just say
[1:41:16] something. How horrible it's going to be
[1:41:20] for people that didn't find it
[1:41:23] convenient enough to come to church.
[1:41:25] Come on.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; They were too busy to come to church.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; But they're ushered into a tribulation
[1:41:34] period
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; where the world is getting ready to go
[1:41:40] through a nightmare.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; A time that's like no other time.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; And to overcome in that day, you have to
[1:41:52] give your life.
[1:41:55] What a stark difference between coming
[1:41:59] to church and get the Holy Ghost on this
[1:42:02] side of the rapture.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; And having to live through a tribulation
[1:42:06] period,
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; I knew such a people that lived such a
[1:42:13] life that in a moment, in the twinkle of
[1:42:16] an air, ah, they went to be with the
[1:42:18] Lord. And it spawned faith in my heart
[1:42:22] that I can overcome the beast and its
[1:42:25] system. I may have to give my life. I
[1:42:28] don't know what preacher will raise up
[1:42:29] in the tribulation period to help people
[1:42:32] that will get through that horrible
[1:42:34] time.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; But why wait?
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you why wait,
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; brother. But I I got to do this and I
[1:42:47] got to do that and I What excuse is
[1:42:49] there?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; What excuse is there to miss this
[1:42:56] messaging?
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; I just don't have words to say it. What
[1:43:01] excuse is it to miss Christ?
[1:43:10] my wife, my husband, my children, and
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; people at my job.
[1:43:21] Your soul will tell you what's important
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; by your actions.
[1:43:31] I know this isn't a shouting sermon, but
[1:43:33] it's one for your soul.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; A long time ago, I made a decision to
[1:43:41] serve the Lord.
[1:43:49] I could have been a lot of things in
[1:43:51] life.
[1:43:54] I was offered politics.
[1:44:00] I sat in a room with huge board,
[1:44:04] powerful people.
[1:44:08] No,
[1:44:10] I was offered a lot of jobs that it
[1:44:13] would have took me away from my family.
[1:44:15] And I said, "No,
[1:44:18] no."
[1:44:20] Ministers stand in the pull pit. A whole
[1:44:22] lot of times people criticize them, but
[1:44:24] they don't know what they've had to go
[1:44:25] through to stand here.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; They don't know the pressures that we've
[1:44:32] had to go through in our lives to be
[1:44:35] standing here.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; I don't need human accolades, but one of
[1:44:38] these days I'm going to hear, "Well
[1:44:40] done, Ryan."
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Well done, God.
[1:44:55] I know every one of us have a different
[1:44:57] story. I know all of us do. Everybody
[1:45:00] sitting here, you've got a different
[1:45:02] story.
[1:45:03] Decisions is always having to be made.
[1:45:05] No matter what your age is or whatever
[1:45:07] times are, you're going to be influenced
[1:45:09] from a lot of dimensions.
[1:45:12] But I want to remind you that on on your
[1:45:16] phone and on your computer, there's a
[1:45:19] magic button called block.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; If you need to clean your phone up after
[1:45:28] this service, clean that baby up.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Don't go nowhere
[1:45:36] that you wouldn't want Jesus to be with
[1:45:38] you.
[1:45:43] Don't have a conversation that you
[1:45:45] wouldn't want the Lord to hear.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm just way car. Well, go
[1:45:53] ahead and get your life straightened up
[1:45:55] a little bit.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Have a have a talk with God
[1:46:00] and tell him.
[1:46:03] very personal friend of mine
[1:46:06] said, "When I got saved,"
[1:46:08] he said, "I took my keys out and I took
[1:46:11] my pocketbook out." And he said, "I laid
[1:46:14] it down before me in prayer." And he
[1:46:17] said, "Father,
[1:46:19] I don't want anything to get between me
[1:46:22] and you."
[1:46:26] And I watched that man in his life,
[1:46:29] decades of hard work.
[1:46:32] And he was offered incredible
[1:46:35] amount of positions
[1:46:38] and those two things never got in his
[1:46:41] way.
[1:46:45] Moms, dads,
[1:46:48] children,
[1:46:51] make some firm commitments today.
[1:46:55] of total separation from unbelief.
[1:46:59] That's where a lot of this came from.
[1:47:03] That you will not go back.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people can walk for a
[1:47:09] few weeks, few months, a couple years,
[1:47:11] but you got to be determined in your
[1:47:13] life, I'm done.
[1:47:16] I'm done with sin. I'm done with that
[1:47:18] lifestyle. I'm done with those kind of
[1:47:20] friendships.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I'm done with those habits.
[1:47:26] I want to separate.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you one more story?
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; I didn't realize how supernatural this
[1:47:40] was.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; I carry in my Bible a a prayer cloth
[1:47:48] and I've carried it quite a long time.
[1:47:52] How I know it's that prayer cloth
[1:47:53] because I've signed it a certain way.
[1:47:56] And
[1:47:58] every sermon that I preached, I had that
[1:48:00] prayer cloth in my Bible.
[1:48:05] And so
[1:48:10] I'll just tell you, Brother Murphy Wong,
[1:48:13] I may have told some of you recently,
[1:48:15] but brother Murphy Wong's wife, we were
[1:48:19] at a cafeteria. Brother Murphy Wong's
[1:48:22] wife said, "Get Brother Ron's napkin.
[1:48:27] I wanted that napkin to pray with."
[1:48:32] I felt about that tall.
[1:48:36] And he said, "Somewhere in the exchange
[1:48:38] of things, somebody came and got your
[1:48:40] plate and I missed that napkin." Said,
[1:48:42] "That was last evening." And he said,
[1:48:45] "Brother, I want to ask you."
[1:48:48] He said, "So I don't lose it. I want to
[1:48:50] ask you here at dinner today, will you
[1:48:53] give me my my napkin?
[1:48:56] I was blown away.
[1:49:01] And just like that,
[1:49:03] I heard a voice in my ear. Go get that
[1:49:07] prayer cloth in your Bible, which I
[1:49:10] count certain things very sacred. Go get
[1:49:13] that prayer cloth in your Bible and cut
[1:49:15] it in half.
[1:49:19] you guys were there.
[1:49:23] Well, I ran. I ran. I don't run much
[1:49:26] now, but I ran to my cabin and I came
[1:49:30] back with that prayer cloth and laid it
[1:49:32] out on the table. Sister Connie, you put
[1:49:33] your hand on one corner. Brother Murphy
[1:49:36] put his hand on that corner and sister
[1:49:39] Mur sister Tracy put her hand on this
[1:49:42] corner and I put my hand on this corner
[1:49:44] and we begin to cut because you it's
[1:49:46] hard to cut a moving object
[1:49:49] and so we were we were cutting it and
[1:49:51] cut it. when I cut it and I handed it to
[1:49:54] her and the presence of God just
[1:50:01] went
[1:50:05] and for about 30 minutes we worshiped in
[1:50:08] the presence of the Lord and we had
[1:50:11] prayer and God just bathed. We were in a
[1:50:14] cafeteria. I don't know how many was in
[1:50:17] there, but it's quite a number that was
[1:50:19] in there. And it just it blessed me so
[1:50:22] much.
[1:50:24] Sister Katie said, "Brother Ron, it was
[1:50:26] just so worth it to see you get that
[1:50:29] kind of blessing. So now I'm going to
[1:50:31] tell you
[1:50:35] when I got back to the room, you said
[1:50:38] last night you went home after and you
[1:50:40] started looking up those quotes that he
[1:50:41] was talking about." When I got back to
[1:50:44] the room,
[1:50:46] the first quote that popped up was the
[1:50:50] Chinese laundry man
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; said he couldn't speak English, so he
[1:51:00] tore it apart and the two pieces would
[1:51:04] fit back together.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; So that was more than just some natural
[1:51:09] event.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; I thought I was moving in some natural
[1:51:16] realm, but God had placed that in my
[1:51:19] heart. And here's the leading
[1:51:23] mission
[1:51:24] man that has printed has
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; that took the English message and put it
[1:51:38] in Chinese.
[1:51:40] Not just the message 1100 and some
[1:51:42] dates, but he's taken the Bible and put
[1:51:46] that in Chinese
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; King James version.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And here he is with his hand on that
[1:51:54] same handkerchief.
[1:52:00] And God just came and honored that whole
[1:52:04] thing.
[1:52:08] You talk about honoring our lives one of
[1:52:10] these days.
[1:52:12] That's a natural thing that happened.
[1:52:15] But one of these days, our life is going
[1:52:18] to match
[1:52:21] the word so much until he says, "Come
[1:52:25] home."
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; Come home.
[1:52:32] I'm going to say this to you and finish.
[1:52:35] It's worth it after all.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:52:59] Maybe you'd like to say, "Brother Ron,
[1:53:00] would you remember me?
[1:53:03] Some things that I just felt in my life.
[1:53:09] You remember me?"
[1:53:16] I'm honest with you. I love these kind
[1:53:18] of services where the Lord just goes,
[1:53:24] just knows how to change our lives and
[1:53:27] just knows how to talk to us a little
[1:53:28] while.
[1:53:32] Your hands lifted before the Lord.
[1:53:35] Maybe if you'd just like to reach over
[1:53:37] and put put your hand on your neighbor's
[1:53:39] shoulder, it doesn't make you feel
[1:53:41] uncomfortable.
[1:53:49] Father,
[1:53:54] [Music]
[1:53:56] Father,
[1:54:00] breathe on us the Holy Spirit.
[1:54:04] [Music]
[1:54:07] Sometimes we're just in a journey.
[1:54:10] Don't know where we're going.
[1:54:13] Circumstances of life has tossed us.
[1:54:21] But we need you more than ever before in
[1:54:23] our lives.
[1:54:25] We can see the condition of our world.
[1:54:30] Oh, how we need you.
[1:54:34] Oh, how we need you like never before,
[1:54:39] Lord.
[1:54:43] I would like a refilling
[1:54:45] while I'm standing here in this
[1:54:47] presence. Lord,
[1:54:49] refill my life.
[1:54:55] You know all about me. Like David said,
[1:54:59] you know my downings, my uprisings.
[1:55:04] You know whether I would be in hell or
[1:55:06] whether I'd be in heaven. You know
[1:55:08] everything.
[1:55:11] You know the depths of my life.
[1:55:15] You know everything, Father.
[1:55:17] And yet in spite of us, you love us.
[1:55:21] Father,
[1:55:23] come fill our lives.
[1:55:26] Come touch our lives today. Our hands
[1:55:29] has went up. We need you, Father.
[1:55:32] We need you.
[1:55:34] When there's words that can't say it, we
[1:55:36] just need you.
[1:55:39] Forgive us.
[1:55:41] We need courage. We need strength.
[1:55:44] We need prophetic optics to see.
[1:55:49] Touch us today.
[1:55:53] Touch us today.
[1:55:56] Thank you, Father, for this service.
[1:55:59] Bless your children.

[1:56:04] Amen. And amen.
