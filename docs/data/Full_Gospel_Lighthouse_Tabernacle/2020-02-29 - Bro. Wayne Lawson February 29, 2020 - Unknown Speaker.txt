tonight father we pray we love you Lord in Jesus Christ name Amen hey man you may be seated I guess I just testify I'm brother Ronnie long and just a regular old brother except for I'm a son of God so that makes me pretty special I believe I believe that if we could just recognize that that part that eternal part in us we would be expecting a lot more we would be hungry for a lot more if we could say that we we came from eternity and we're going back to eternity and you know maybe you don't know me but I know you we know the church here I think we came for the meetings and back in September I think they were and we just had a glorious time in the Lord and there were so many different faces and things but maybe we didn't get to know everybody but we'd sure love you in the name of the Lord and in the ministry here has been such a blessing in my life personally just getting to know your pastor over the last few years and and what the Lord has done in my life through his ministry and I believe it's just beginning I believe I'm gonna hear more and more and I believe the Lord is gonna deliver deliver a lot more than just me through the ministry from this pulpit I believe in a supernatural God and I don't want to take time away from the service but but maybe I just share a quick testimony if that's all right and and there's been a few times in my life when I've asked God for the supernatural not just on a whim or on a feeling but when you when you're really get in the depths of despair and you ask God for the supernatural and I can testify tonight that he always delivers he's always shown the supernatural and you know a lot of times maybe we don't have we don't have the gifts that we that we want and you say well I don't see the supernatural the Lord doesn't work with me that way but I would just ask tonight if we could ask God to open our eyes tonight I know he'll do it because he's done it for me you just pray to the Lord and your seat and say Lord I want to see the supernatural not I want to see you move like we've heard of you move in the end the books in the Bible and we heard of you move through the ministry of the Prophet I want to see you move tonight and I just just share this testimony for the glory of God maybe to increase our faith and there was a service that I was I was at and at this little village up in Alaska it was just a few maybe 60 people there and and the word of the Lord had been had been coming forth for a few days and and there was a there was a brother that used to go to the church there and he had fallen away from from belief in the message of what we believe in and we went to visit them and I said well we'll see you we'll see you tonight and he said what's tonight I said what's a nice church he said why don't go to that church I said well we'll see you tonight and so he came to the church and the first the first service of the meeting he was sitting in the back row and the pastor kind of elbowed me and he said that's the first time I've seen that brother in seven years here civil praise the Lord that service came and God did work and then the next night he was sitting in the middle and the next night he was sitting in the front row and I began to testify that if you ask God for the supernatural he'll show you the supernatural and and the Spirit of Lord began to fall in the building and people just began to make requests out in the it's a little bit less formal there and and sometimes that's good we didn't have a microphone we didn't have speakers we didn't have monitors we didn't have the electronics we just barely had lights on but the Spirit of God began to move in that building and and the people's faith began to ignite and I remembered when we were when we were there in that service we were taking a Oberer from the airport to the center Airport to get there and and she said oh you're going to see my people she said if you can show them the supernatural they'll believe whatever you preach to him and so that whole time that was on my mind i lord i want to see the supernatural in this meeting i want to see the supernatural come and and I had that on the back of my mind during this service and and just asking God and people began to come up for prayer and the Spirit of God began to come down like a wave I don't know if I've ever experienced it that strong in my life just a wave through the building and and one sister came up and she began to pray and and she asked that she would have a renewed experience in the word and and I'm just telling all this for the glory of God that it could increase our faith and and and and the Spirit of God began to tell her exactly what her prayer was and what what she was praying for and and that it called out her daughter that was sitting in the back back of the church and said that you actually praying for your daughter because she's suicidal but in Jesus name she is gonna be delivered and her daughter ran to the front she said that's me and it began to build the people's faith in the building and and one after the other the people began to get prayed for and to begin to get delivered through the the ministry that was there and and and then the pastor got out in front of the church and he said I have a need he said I feel the power of God is in this building he said I have eight children and he said only four of them are serving the Lord he said but I would like to call the other four his name before the Lord that they would that they would serve the Lord he said but I want to start with my oldest son he said I haven't seen him in a long time he's in the wrong crowd he's he's in drugs and he's in he's an alcoholic I don't know where he's added mind you this is a village in the middle of Alaska where you can't drive there there's no roads there's only about eight hundred people there you have to fly to get there on a little plane he said I haven't seen him in years I think he's he's somewhere down in the city and we began to pray and other other other things begin to come forth in the in the prayer line and we begin to pray for that that Pastor seeking the need and I just felt the power Lord to say in Jesus name we said at eight times for all of his children he said but I'm claiming my first one to come forth to the name of Jesus Christ and he came back behind the pulpit and kept leading the songs and and we saw we saw the God do some tremendous things and then all of a sudden I began to see his wife start to shout in the spirit and dance around and and run in the spirit across the church and just begin to twirl and I looked and the pastor was twirling around the platform I thought what what just happened that I and I looked in the back and a young man had walked to the back door God's my witness a young man had walked in the back door there's no God like our God he had walked in the back door and he looked a little rough at first and he was a little red-faced and he leaned up against that wall and the songs begin to get sung and before I knew it he raised his hand and then he started singing the songs with no words up on the screen he just started sighs - this this boy's been in church before well I think you know the story it was his oldest son that he hadn't seen in years on and off night it wasn't even a regular Church night found his way to that church when you just can't get there you got to be there you don't just show up in that village but God had ordained that before the foundation of the world that we would be having service that night and that he would have a need in the church and that God would respond to that boy's heart and bring him in the back door for a vindication of what this message is is the truth and that brother that had fallen away from the message was sitting right there in the front row when it happened and he knew the boy he knew him when he left church and he stood up and he said I can believe that message and he ran up to the front and said my faith is restored in the message of Malachi 4 [Applause] there's no God like our God we serve this because it's a living God he's alive to do the miraculous in our life who we can call on him to do the supernatural he will answer he will answer us if we could just call on him to do the supernatural just about a month ago I was in a meeting and in Africa and the brother came up and said I need to see the supernatural I've had epilepsy my whole life 24 years he said I want to see the supernatural I said do you believe that this message is true he said if it can produce the supernatural I believe it's the truth and we pray for that boy and I watched his eye he had a crooked eye I watched it go straight and those Caesar that Caesar spirit went off and left him and went out the door because he was looking for the for natural so I would ask us tonight are we looking for the supernatural to take place in our life are we looking for God to do something miraculous that no man can do but it must be God that's the kind of God we serve that's that's the message that we believe in it's not about what we can do in ourselves but it's about believing on him that's already done it we sure love you in the name of Jesus Christ we believe that tonight don't we maybe sister Tracy would come and sing for us at this time if she would and then after her maybe sister autumn would prepare to come for us god bless you [Music] you disappointed you desperate for help you know what it's like to be tired Noli oh shut up yourself you

Bethany is a real blessing and man and she she told me though they she said that I wrote a song and she said she sent it to me and I said well didn't you write one like this before but I guess it was deja vu or I dreamed it or something but but it was it was a phenomenal we should appreciate the Lord for her amen and the blessing on him tonight we want to take a few things from the word the Lord and maybe just speak to you we do count it an honor to be here of course and we sure have been buddies with brother Ron and his boys Matthew and Andrew and I want to thank them for the opportunity to speak to you tonight and and the confidence to be here we trust that that the great one will be among us a man and that he would come and receive some glory tonight we want to maybe speak a few things to you and and I just want to take from the Book of Kings here first Kings I want to read from first Kings the eighteenth chap I want to read from the 38 verse here first Kings chapter 18 verse 38 you'll recognize this is when Elijah is upon the mountain he's on Mount Carmel there's been a showdown and the Bible said then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the Lord he is the God the Lord he is the God if you go with me to the book of Joshua in the second chapter that was the children of Israel how many knowles brother Bram said that was the the 7,000 that Elijah was looking for when they saw that vindicated Word they screamed out he is God now here's a Gentile testimony from the Old Testament when they went into the spies into Jericho they found Rahab back there and she said under the men I know that the Lord have given you the land and that your terror is falling upon them all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you but we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt and what you did under the two kings of the Amer rights that were on the other side of Jordan shown and all whom ye utterly destroyed and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the Lord your God He is God in heaven above and in earth beneath Amen let's just bow our hearts father it is such an honor to be here tonight with your children and Lord as we have read your word father I pray that my voice would mingle with the voices of these from the scripture that you are God Lord we have found you to be the God in the heaven and God in the earth you're the God that controls all things and we ask you tonight that you would show yourself alive that you would come amongst us Oh God as you have promised as you have given us your word and we ask you now that you would just take this meeting Lord may you use us in us in a special way may you set us aside this evening to speak to your children and father as we would say something to them I pray that you would bless them let your anointing charge this building Oh God now we're asking you for a divine presence we commit this meeting into your hand blessing the people Lord present and them the Lord that are streaming tonight I pray that you would bless them Oh God me your hand be upon them if there be any sick Lord or any need there I just pray that you would extend your mercy father we ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ we ask for these things a man and a man and may God bless you tonight as you would be seated I want to if I can just speak to you a little bit tonight and I want to talk to you if I would take a title tonight I want to talk to you about this that God our God he is God our our God is God amen and I know that there's a lot of different things a lot of people talk about gods and they and I've traveled in the in the eastern world and I've seen all of the religions and the idols and the different aspects of what people think and believe amen but in all of my travels and experiences and and all the people that I know I have found one thing remains to be true that our God he is God amen Jesus Christ is a supreme deity he is above all other gods when I think of this tonight I think of how the Bible would recognize him and Jesus himself would say that I am the God of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the God of Jacob and God is not the god of the dead but of the living a man I believe that he is God now tonight when we think about this we think about the name of God and we we say God but you know the word God would be translated in English of course but if you start thinking about Hebrew and you start thinking about Elohim and Jehovah and you start thinking about the titles and the appropriations of the names to God amen but you know it's not until you get into Matthew that you begin to understand that there is a human name of God and that that human name according to Matthew chapter 1 and verse 25 the Bible said and that he knew her not till she had brought forth her son her firstborn son and called his name Jesus so Jesus would be the only human name that God would use and that would be a name for all redemption for everything that a human needs would come through the name of Jesus Christ everything that God has for the church tonight will come through the name of Jesus Christ amen now if you start looking at names of course names characterizes life and you know brother brems teaching of how even Elvis and and these names even Brandon Lee these kinds of names didn't even come to the end time so there's certain kinds of names represent certain things no brother man says when you start talking about names characterizing things he said people said well brother Branham that's numerology he said no now that's thus sayeth the Lord a name will characterize a person and when you start talking about a name so you say the name of Jesus Christ that is characterizing a life that when you say the name you're talking about their life that is behind that name so when you say something in the name of Jesus you're invoking more than just a human name but you're talking about the life behind that name when you call me a Lawson you're talking about my heritage and where I come from in the blood and and that name carries something well when you say the name of Jesus you're starting to talk about something more than a human it's the life that was behind that name now tonight we think about approaching God and we approach God in the name of Jesus but you you see that when the Bible was first written when Moses talks about a God and he starts talking about how that God created the heavens and the earth now you go back that far and you start finding out that God was Elohim which would have been he was he was God brother man said actually a self existing one in other words no one was there with him amen but he was just God or Elohim right amen and that meant that he existed with his family you go read Genesis 1 and you'll see the Bible says and God created the heavens and earth and God spoke and God did but in Genesis the second chapter God Himself takes a name change when he creates Adam the Bible said and the Lord God formed man from the dust of the earth so now he's adding a jehovah unto elohim so he's now saying jehovah Elohim in other words God is not self existent anymore he has created something off of himself which would be like him which was Adam and Eve is that right so the first time God ever took an ancient was when the word created a being that was both male and female amen in that male and female being created together amen caused God to change his name because now he's not existing by himself but he has extended himself in family and so now he begins to call himself Jehovah God or in other words so now he's having a relationship amen and when a man begins to have a relationship with his family it begins to pull characters out of him Amen that other people maybe never seen never never you know when a man becomes a daddy Amen you see him in character like he's never been a man becomes a husband things begin to be drawn out of him and we find when glob is self-existent there was no exhibit a Shanor no no there was no release of the great things that was in him but as soon as he had a family amen then God now had a place that he could release the character amen and the great power that was held inside of him and in his ability when you go back in the scripture and you begin to read how that God changed his name and becomes of course Jehovah Elohim brother man says it amen in the message seven compound names of Jehovah 1955 he said seven compound names of Jehovah in other words it was what Jehovah is made up seven redemptive names and these would be his attitude toward the people from Eden back to Eden again see wrapped in the seven redemptive names so when you start talking about Jehovah he meant you just say the name Jehovah amen and it means a lot but but in the days of Adam when he was in the garden he meant he knew him as Jehovah but there was more to God than just the time or the word Jehovah that was so much more in God and brother BAM taught us that God allowed the fall in the Garden of Eden amen not a man it was never his will for them to fall but it was certainly God's will for them to know he was a redeemer it was certainly never his will for someone to get sick but it was certainly his will for someone to know he was a healer see so God then had things in him that could only be drawn out by situations amen and if you start looking you'll see how Amen that God into the children of Abraham releases his name of Jehovah when the scripture talks about the first time that God releases an attribute to the name Jehovah is when he talks about being Jehovah Jireh in Genesis 22 in verse 13 and 14 this is released to Abraham when Abraham was going up on a mountain in the end of his life he's waited 25 years for a child and then God has told him to kill the thing that he's been waiting on for 25 years so he's not being tested on whether or not he believes God to have a child now he's being tested on the child that God gave him and it says right in the end of his life it's actually the last test of Abraham's life and it of course is a type of word the bride is today and as Abraham went up on the mountain with his son Isaac Amen remember the story they're going and they're gonna go to worship because God said to offer thy son Isaac and and they're gonna go up on the mountain and Isaac knowing the style of worship his father he knows he sacrifices animals and gives the blood back to his God Jehovah and and and and they usually burned the sacrifice so God and God has Abraham taken Isaac up the mountain and as they're going up the mountain and the part way up there of course Abraham and Isaac are talking and Isaac says to his father well father here's the wood and here's the fire but worse there's the lamb he meant now he knew a sacrifice required a lamb so so Isaac was actually realizing that we need something here that we don't have now of course Abraham was making his son Isaac the very sacrifice and he was going to have to sacrifice him but before they ever went on the mountain amen before he ever went to take his life he actually already said the boy and I will go up on the mountain and the boy and I will return now Abraham exactly intended to sacrifice his child amen but he knew that he had received him from the dead and that God was able to raise him from the dead he meant now now we find that when Abraham got to the place he was not willing they meant to withhold anything from God and when he was laying there his son was there he was about to take his life it was in that very moment the angel stayed the hand of Abraham he Abraham thou have not withheld 9 only Son amen and then God began to bless him and then immediately they turned to look and there was a realm Amen hung over in the bushes by its horns and mother man said now Abraham had gathered rocks Abraham had built an altar Abraham had been up there while had had never saw that realm he said where did that Ram come from he said God created that realm Amen that Ram wasn't there to start with God created the that realm amen and when Abraham saw that God was willing to create something to provide the need of his child he turned around and built another altar and he said my God is Jehovah Jireh he is the Lord that provide us our every need let me tell you something tonight God is a provider to his children he is a provider of every deed of his children I tell you what tonight I I am Abraham seed and I have held amen but there's an altar been built in my life and I have held that he is still Jehovah Jireh he's told a diary and I'll not listen for him Amen God is able to supply whatever a man has need of we could stand here all night and talk about how that God is Jehovah Jireh but it was in in a great way we found it was when Jesus was upon the earth he meant that when he created the bread and fed 5,000 people with just a few two loaves of bread that's when his disciples begin to understand that the man were walking with is more than just a man he has the habits of Jehovah he does the things Jehovah does a many you see he knew them people knew that it was Jehovah Jireh that created bread in the wilderness for 2 million people he was able to bring amen water for 2 million people he was able to provide for an entire camp and when they saw Jesus Amen multiplying bread they said there's one of God's habits right there he is a supplier of the need of the Church of the Living God let me tell you something tonight God's not breaking the habits of supplying to the Church of the Living God he is able tonight to supply everything to every child they've been in the presence of God amen I'll tell you he's a financial River he's a God that can supply the needs of our healing of our salvation you say preacher where's it coming from I don't know where it coming from but I know he is still Jehovah Jireh tonight I'm talking about just a God in history but what about the god of William Branham he's still God tonight that was the god amen that stood there and create his quarrel six times in a row and when Haley Wright said she said Haman how did it happen brother Branham he said he steal Jehovah Jireh Hattie he's still able to provide just like he did for Abraham he did for me huh and about that time he was leading the healing for her children amen and she found out he's not only a provider a man of squirrels he's not only a provider of bread he is providing miracles he is still a Jehovah Jireh hey man what did what did bud Southwood find out and man when they were looking for a for a 42 inch for a 42 inch caribou and when they finally found that part of the vision amen they realized a part of the vision but but Southwick was wondering brother random were right down the fee and now and you said we have a 42 inch caribou I see that but you said they'd be a grizzly bear and you said we'd kill one before we got to the end and but Southwick came in could you imagine they were standing this short grass everywhere and brother man brother man tails he said you can see for miles amen and that boy can see the finish line just like the church can see the ends for what were standing and cuts I begin to ask he began to say I can see the end I can see it but around so where is the thing it's been promised and brother branham said to him listen bud he is still Jehovah Jireh amen he's still a god that can provide if it's selling in the vision that God is able to provide it and let me say to you tonight I know there's things that you're looking for Amen that you haven't saw but he still the provider and is still able tonight to come right into this church you don't have to see where it's coming from God is still God is the creator he's the one that created the first swirl he's the one that created the first ramp he's the one that created the first this world the Bible he is he's the god of Isaac he's the God of Jacob ah he is still gone now now he's still gone mr. Boleyn I don't see where it's coming from we don't have to know where it's coming from we've got to know the God that can supply it you know to think of it tonight hey man that's a prophecy lading over you hey Paul said it he said there'll be a glorious church it'll be without spot wrinkle it'll be a glorious church William Brandon come along and said it'll be an invincible army he said is she will know who she is she will know what she stands for and the devil will be powerless before her and you said where's it coming from I say it's coming right out of you I say God is able to take a man or woman a child and create a faithful the inside of him to make them everything God said they would be oh my do you see amen look how long they could have lived on Jehovah Jireh but God said whoa wait a minute I'm more than that how I can provide but I'm more than a provider I tell you what I am I am God and I am Jehovah Rapha I am Jehovah Rapha Java Rafe is actually known as the Lord that healeth can you imagine the way God shows this to the church he shows it to him when Moses crosses the Red Sea and they've been through all that wilderness and all that trouble and they get out and they come up to a to a pool of water and that water is bitter waters the bitter waters of Myra is it matter is that is that correct bitter words of Myra they get up to that water and while their stands have been the waters of Myra amen it's right there Amen that Moses finds a stick laying on the bank and that stick represents cry and Moses throws that stick in the water and heals the water and right there he built an altar and says he is Jehovah Rapha the Lord that healeth me now think of this tonight because Moses Moses is leading two million people forty years through a wilderness Amen can you imagine the kind of of Medicine bag you would need for two million people in 40 years of wilderness but the man said I'd like to see his medicine cabinet he said he only had one thing he said he said I had the Lord that he loved me but he lovely hey man you said preacher you you against medicine absolutely not I take all my medicine in the name of Jesus I know that doctors help me I know hospitals help me but if I'm healed it's Jesus that heals me Amen this man had a prescription for TB he had a prescription for problems every one of them was the same I am the lord that healeth II do you see that was not one feeble person in that wilderness so somebody says well I'll tell you what Amen they must left all the old and sick behind a mint but in an amazing that there is an entire section of scripture about this because Moses argues with Pharaoh and you think some of the arguments are are no are not worth reading but when you go back and realize that God made Pharaoh argue with Moses about taking the children out of Egypt and he said to him Amen just go on in lead part of a Mac which was a perfect opportunity for Moses to leave the sequence behind the feeble ones behind remembered Moses said to Pharaoh I'm not gonna leave one not even gonna leave us behind amen you hear what I'm saying to you Moses didn't have to leave nobody behind because riding for night of the Passover they took communion and they eat the bread with her shoes holding the staff in their hand and when they ate that lamb they begin to eat a healing into their body oh and they changed something tonight that Passover lamb is Jesus Christ and he is his word and every time we take a pot hopeful I am the lord that he the fee that is a healing that comes into our body hey man listen we're not gonna back up for no devil amen our God is a God of healing he's a gonna pound he's a God of ability no sir devil you showed up at the wrong place this is a place where lawyers Oh God yes God no run church won't place this is a house of God the children Abraham's seed they get her in this kind of place you see said I'm the Lord that he hath II you say preacher what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that there was not a feeble one Psalms 105 37 David said he brought them out with silver and gold and there was not a feeble one among he brought him out with silver and gold Jehovah Jireh brought him out healed not a snowless not a not one in the bunch now what's what he's saying to you Psalms 103 verses 1 to 4 David sang the song bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His Holy Name bless the Lord O my soul and forget not his benefits he forgiveth all thine iniquity and he healeth all thy diseases in the beautiful forgiveness of sin and healing of disease is put in the same verse that's why the prophet of God said the same blood that saves you it's the same blood that heals you Amen if you're standing tonight confessing your salvation you still might have temptation but you don't change your confession and if you're standing for a healing you still might have pain you still might have suffering but we've never changed the confession because by here ah he is the God that forgiveth disease he is the God that forgive Athan iniquity who healeth eye diseases that's right the brass serpent was put in the wilderness as seeing already judged amen the people looked upon it and were healed of course that brass serpent represented Jesus Christ going to the cross and on the cross took the judgments of our sin and in his body paid every debt he paid every bed for sin listen to me not people saying well maybe something happens because of this problem baby something happens because of this problem the first thing we need to do is answer the same question amen if we put it under the blood and we confess our sins in the blood there is now no more condemnation to feel better in Christ Jesus and we've got a right to stand in the principle of every promise in the Bible and Saint by His stripes we are healed Isaiah 53 who have to believe that reported to whom is the arm of the Lord for he shall grow up as a tender plant as a root out of a dry ground he has no form or comeliness that we should see him there's no beauty that we should desire him he has despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows acquainted with grief he hath hid if it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed in not but surely he hath borne our griefs amen in the original sickness or pain he has borne our sicknesses our griefs and carried away our sorrows our pain and yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God afflicted and he was wounded for our transgressions his bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed my listen to me tonight healing is not free but it's paid for healing it's not free but it's paid for it has been paid for by the very beating of the body of Jesus Christ who was Jehovah Rapha in the flesh our God come and took 39 stripes and carried his body to the grid to the to the cross that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ 1st Peter 2 and 24 let's just give the devil a beating y'all want to first Peter 2:24 he has his own self bare our sins in his own body Amen on that tree we being dared to see him should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye are healed the devil was to tell you there's no basis for this kind of healing there's no basis for miracles there's no basis for divine healing but brother Jesus Christ took 39 stripes in his body that I a sinner could be saved and stand tonight and proclaim that Jesus paid the price for our redemption in his body then by His stripes he were past his heel right past hence healed that's what he did for you at Calvary then that's when he overcome all sickness and sin at Calvary Loree think about it tonight you say how did in the weekend Healing March 16 it is the commission of the church go into the world and preach the gospel and he that believeth this baptized and shall be but he that believeth not shall be damned these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they should cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents didn't they drink deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover isn't in the Bible is there any sick among you let us pray for him let us sing songs any sick let him call for the elders let them play over him anointing him at all in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him I tell you it's powerful here tonight because you think it would take an angel to do that don't you but the Bible said the official fervent prayer of a righteous man we love you much you say who's the righteous man then they say here just like Elijah a man of like passion then brother Ellen says the righteous man's not a perfect man amen he's a man under the blood amen a man under the blood is a righteous man there's nobody worthy to lay their hands on somebody but when a man is under the blood he does it in the name of Jesus Christ there's an authority the same preacher Amen that's just a message for the earth really Amen Paul said this we for holy brethren partakers of my heavenly calling consider the Apostle and the high priest of our confession Jesus Christ there is an apostle to what I appreciate there's a high priest of what I'm preaching his name is Jesus Christ and tonight his blood leaves upon the throne of God as a sacrifice for our redemption power sitting here tonight oh I know the devil don't like it but I don't like the devil either we're not going to show that devil one ounce of mercy not one in the armor not one spirit of fear not one spirit of criticism not one spirit of an eighth card to Satan in the name of Jesus Christ but truth in authority and the power I'll tell you that's a dumb devil that's a gunbattle he attacks the wrong people at the wrong times [Music] he's a high priest of our confession Oh people so while confessions don't mean nothing william branham said he said you start confessing something he said you start confessing you're a drunk and you're a sinner he said you keep up that confession you will be he said that's the power of confession do you know that Jesus can only intercede what you confess that he can only pay a payment for what you confess think about this he can only offer what you're able to confess amen now think of this because some might say well by the way that's good just to say it well look what look what happened in our time to prove it with blind John ride with blind John line coming in the meeting and brother Bannon telling him thus saith the Lord you're healed right the man left the platform blind as a bat sat down in the meetings run back up to brother branham said I can't see nothing brother Branham he said John I thought you said you believe me he said I thought she said I was healed he said I thought you said you believed me he said I do believe your brother Brandon but I can't see he said what does that have to do with it John he said I told you you're healed in the name of Jesus he said well what do I do brother and he said you go testify about your healing now John nothing physically changed that night the only thing that changed was his confession two weeks later the angel of the Lord Amen come by when John was sitting in a barber chair confessing about a healing while he was blind as a bat he was just as bad off as he was the first night but there was to change his face had caught a hold of a word and that word was creating something hypnotized John said it you know what brother Bantam said he said even when you start saying it you say it even if you don't believe it he said you keep saying it - you do believe it hey man you just keep saying you've not saying a lie you're saying the Word of God you keep saying it and tell there's something in your heart to test us that's the truth oh that man knew he come to his healing two weeks later Amen now if that was Justin brother Brandon stay that I'd have to tell that with an uncertainty but see I have a certainty of the God that I'm serving I have had an experience with that God this is not a story book this is not a painted picture I'm not talking about what God used to be I'm talking to you about the God that is living right now in this building the God that is here in supreme power in supreme deity we're not playing a game God is God He is God above everything every demon in every cow [Music] you see what I found out we don't have to have something new but we gotta have what God gave us and made real to us and then I was sitting in a service one night where there was a lady who was paralyzed sitting in the surge paralyzed of stroke she was paralyzed in one half of her body and she would pull around like this and she was so under condemnation because of her former life she didn't even know if God would heal her but she come up and talked to me and I talked to her about the grace of God she had already repented and been in the church amen but she's standing up paralyzed in that half and I prayed for her and I said look sis I'm just a man that's nothing brother Wayne can do for you I said but I offer the prayer the way the Bible said then the Prophet said you go testify what God has done for you she said well by the way she said my daughter's a nurse and every time I pray praise God for a healing my body he said your you're making a you're making a what could you say your you're making a mockery because you're you're saying you're healed and you're not healed mom you're still just as paralyzed as you ever was she said my lane I don't want them to think that I'm doing something wrong I said listen since my Bible said let every man's work be alive that this won't be true and the prophet of God said lines he said remember when that when them beans was coming up and he poked him back down this moment said how you doing he said I'm doing all right he said somebody said your line brother and me said no I'm confessing I tell you what when that woman started confessing she come back that night y'all know the story somebody's hurting she'd come back that night limped her way right to the front I was I had a mic just like this one I stand there with a lollipop mic and since she come right to the front and I'm thinking in my mind I pray for you and I pray again because I believe in second chances and third and fourth and fifth I pray when you speak times she come amen but when she was standing there but in my heart I was saying I can't help her ain't man only thing I can do is pray for her and when I I went to lay my hand on her she looked up at me kind of funny and she said no no bro Lane she said I want to testify I said what she said yeah I want to testify God heal me this morning she reached up with that paralyzed hand and when she went to get the mic she got it with that bad hand and then hands straightened up and that leg stand up and mother she passed across that cut for me at work [Applause] yes God is thought of the heavens he has gone to the earth below he is still tall he is still Jehovah timer he is still doubled arepa he still has the ability tonight simple Wayne is that stuff real amen I'll tell you it's real God revealed his name as Jehovah rafer you can't say his name unless you say he's a healer watch watch Moses got to Moses have to reveal another portion of God when in Exodus remember they were fighting with the Amalekites and there's a big battle going on in the valley and Moses said to the people y'all bow down and fight but I'll take a couple boys and we'll go up on the Mount and remember Moses got up on the mountain and held his hands up and he watched the battle from the mountain and while he was watching his hands was high but the Bible tells us that every time his hands started coming down every time he started getting weak the battle would turn and go the other way now now you can easily see what's happening right Amen Moses was the banner of how the battle was going because the people were fighting on the same plane you can't see very far in the battle right so your personal battle is the way you judge how the whole thing's going so if a person was loosened I meant or if they were winning instead of gauging it by their personal battles they would look up on the mountain and they'd see how Moses was saying the battle was going and however Moses said that's the way they fought when Moses his hand started coming down they started losing courage he bent so the man that was with him solid Haman and they got one on side the other and they lifted up Moses he pants and they stood there three of them with their hands lifted saying we got a victory here and the people started fighting that they had never fought before they called him Jehovah they called him to home to Sitka knew Jehovah Nissi which is our banner now I tell you it's a powerful thing because Moses was only a type of Christ amen but when Moses died the people went right all right but Jesus Christ the Son of God he was a prophet like to Moses and when he died he died on Calvary's tree and they took his hands and they nailed them up on the tree so that they could never come down anytime you look at Jesus you're gonna see victory you've got to look away from your personal battle I'm preaching to you now you've got to look away you've got to look away from your problems in your marriages you got to look away from the problem in your family you've got to look away from the problem in the church and look to Calvary and you'll have to turn and say we've got victory it's victory it's victory oh so maybe it's changed in the end no because in Revelation still with the mighty angel descends out of heaven he still has his hands lifted up his hands as in victory of the church what is it God is telling the church your victory it's not coming from you it's coming from him now of course there are there's a lot in these things but I want to maybe just say this that he did he actually built amen he actually built an altar and called him Jehovah our banner he's our banner the banner of the church is the old rugged cross you see the banner of the church as long as you hold that up that will be a victory you remember in battles how they got a abandoned maker or a man who run ahead of the battle and it would hold up the American flag or the ebrill Jima is one of the major things they always tried to take a land and then lift the flag and all the soldiers fighting would see the flag lifted and know exactly is that Roger hey man I tell you what there was a story one time about of a banner maker it meant a man who was running that banner amen and somebody hard for everybody retreat but he didn't hear so he just kept running he kept running and after a while he got so far up there somebody said to him hey you got to come back here where the people are he meant any hard back he said no I'm not going back to the men you tell the men to move up to Araya amen and I'll tell you tonight this is not a time to go backwards this is a time for the church to move up the power of God we're not going back we're going forward [Applause] [Music] said preacher don't you think with all the things going on in the world you are to sound a retreat by now listen this preacher don't know that sound I don't have that in my in my battle skills and I never learned the tune of retreat that's a trumpet player right he tells the church he tells the battle words go and how to go amen and you know they said one time they had a young trumpet ear that had learned part of it but they was doing so good I only learned was charge and one day they the man hollered sing the battle holler back said hey hey men sound the retreat and the man thought oh man he said well I don't know about retreat so he hold for the charge amen and the whole group of the battle people just begin to move into the battle with a charge because of some little fella who didn't know any better that just to believe we can win this fight I might not be a gentleman but I know the God that is with us and I believe we can win the bag I think with I wish that was a trumpet player right now I will tell you Church charge [Applause] [Applause] [Music] comfortable in this place around here [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you might think I'm crazy and I might be but I'm seeing things in the supernatural realm that is telling me there's more of us than there is theme preacher what's your reasoning I don't have no reasoning I got the Word of God and it said we are more than able to take this land we are more than able to destroy every devil you're able to stop out every disease we're able to tear down every wall we are the seed of Abraham I've got a different kind of banner tonight my banner is not an American flag my band is not a European flag my banner is the flag of the old rugged cross I wished I had one right now I'd wave it to you but y'all know what this means don't you y'all know what this means don't you it means devil I'm still here you might be fighting but I'm still here you might be pressing but I'm still here I told the devil get wild back every time I preach he told me I'm gonna get you and I was just a kid I won't keep you I won't destroy ya you're never gonna make it Amen you know what I figured out after a while he wasn't nothin but a lying devil and I told that devil you might fight remember I got ever right to fight back if he's going to use every dirty trick he's got I think the church are to use every word God give up this is not a battle for half the message this is a battle for every quote that says you're healed and the quote that says God is blessing you that God has forgiven you that god holds nothing against you amen we're not coming in the name of a man we're coming in the name of the Most High God He is God and there is none beside him so by the way you're crazy man listen listen I've got peace but got peace where I'm at because the Lord revealed to Gideon I am the god of peace and judges six Gideon found out that his name was Jehovah his name was Jehovah shallow his name is Jehovah shallow do you know what Gideon was Gideon was facing the greatest battle of his life do you know that Gideon Amen God had a lot of confidence in him but he didn't have any confidence in himself and he was living among the media nights which means strife he had no ability whatsoever to get out of the mess he was him that God came to him and said to him I have chosen you as a mighty man of Valor hey man and you're gonna drive out the inhabitants of this land he had to have four or five confirmations Amen he even questioned God himself but when he got done when he was sure of the vindicated presence of God with him you know what he did he build him an altar and he worshiped on that altar and called his name Jehovah Shalom they ended on that he called him the God of peace and he never had yet stepped in the battle amen God gave him peace before he ever killed the first Midianite before he ever drove out the first one God gave him peace and Men the man had peace for the battle he meant because God had already given him the victory before he ever stepped off the platform God gave the man peace you said well brother Lane how in the world hey man could God give a man peace like that he vindicated his presence do you see what he done he vindicated his presence so God give him the name Jehovah Shalom man and he knew God as the God of peace that's amazing to me because in john 14 jesus said i will give you peace he actually says my peace I give unto you not as the world would give it a mint but I'll leave it with you he was going to the cross but he had a peace that was coming to the church by a word that if the people would believe him they would have peace in the time of trouble listen missus the God of peace that was with him amen my mind works like this I'm sorry but if I believe if he's God in the Bible he was God in Jesus Christ amen do y'all know the Bible teaches that Jesus got on a boat with a bunch of disciples and he said to them cast off were going to the other side amen and Jesus went down and went to sleep in the belly of the boat amen and they took out across the sea amen and brother men said they actually started discussing how that Jesus was that Jehovah and they started recognizing the habits that he had as the habits of his father and they begin to compare them and brother ben says watch now 10,000 devils rose up and said you're not going to the other side 10,000 devils rose up to kill Christ and to sink that boat that night but brother Brandon said notice this now he meant Jesus had already said we're going to the other side and mending 10,000 Devils is not enough to sink a boat when God said you're going to the other side Ten Thousand Devils rose up that night and said we'll sink this boat but that was one God that was him that boat that was more powerful than ten thousand Devils on that sea that night and I'll tell you what they did after they got tired of weary and and fussing and fearing they went down and woke up Jesus and when they woke Jesus up he come and stood on the bow of the boat amen and Jehovah shall old stood in Jesus Christ and he looked at the waves and said peace be unto you and the God that created the waves and the wind began to use only his word only his word but his word was coming from the lips of the Messiah and he stopped the storm in the middle of the trip are you hearing me amen they was going to the other side didn't matter how many devil said they wasn't they're going and when God decides you're going somewhere it don't matter how many devil says you're not going if God says you're going God told Moses don't get my people and come back to this mountain in worship me he didn't know about Pharaoh he didn't know about the Red Sea he didn't know about the troubles he was going to face but God had already said you're bringing them people back here then it didn't matter what got in the way God would make it move because they're going to the other side now you're gonna be real careful because when you get in the hard way if you're not careful look at the Scourge mental calm and brother band said God loves to put you in a hard place he loves to put you in a hard place he said just to see what you're gonna do he let the Hebrew children come down to the place of shutting the gate before he showed up he'd let he willing to see what they were going to do he meant he put them at the banks of the sea before he ever opened the water but brother Ryan says when you come to a place then it's too high to go over it it's too low to get under it it's too wide to get around it it's too thick to go through it he said that's when God will Lake away with every temptation there is a way of escape and God says we're going through then God's got to make a way for us to get proved by hardest things in our lives the greatest trials the greatest tragedies we've got to get through do you see the God the God of peace Jehovah Shalom now you don't think you quit being God when Jesus died in Berryman's robes but Paul actually says in Romans 16 and 20 the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet can you imagine the God of peace is planning to use you to brew Satan the god of peace has planned to use you to stop his enemy now I tell you when you start thinking about this I know it gets a little it gets a little weird and you are kind of troubling to a person that's thinking about you mean God has decided I'm going to walk over his enemy but see don't never forget this it's a defeated enemy Amen that there is a people whom God has anointed to put Satan under their feet they meant to think tonight that God anoints you to be a serpent bruiser he meant that God would anoint the church to be a serpent bruiser to put Satan under your feet because he's the God of peace notice this this is the same God William Branham was serving when he was up on the mountain out in Colorado and a storm came a blizzard amen it was gonna shut down the hunt brother Brennan said a voice said to me go back up on the mountain he said go back up into that storm hey Ben but when he got up there God said to him my voice still calms the winds and it still ceases the storms and brother back and begin to say storm you go back where you come from and son you come out and you shine for three days do you see what is happening a prophet is exhibiting the same God that was in the Bible amen to make him a present tense God to the church in this last days hey man can we take her can we take a little time not notice this David found out in Psalms 23 he said the Lord is my shepherd Amen Jehovah is our Shepherd Amen you know who your shepherd is tonight God is your Shepherd you see what David said the Lord is my shepherd hey brother listen if the Lord is your Shepherd amen then then so God is protecting you tonight amen that just has the sheepfold that david protected he was saying god is my shield God is light buckler God is my hiding place he knew he was his Shepard now you you think about you think about a shepherd a shepherd a man who can stand out in the field and call the sheep it can tell the Sheep to come here and they know the voice of that shepherd I don't know if y'all have ever seen any videos it's pretty amazing to have two men stand out in the whole group of a sheep out there in the mantle hollering heating the Sheep won't move that lets Shepherd calm their kind because jesus said my sheep they know my voice and a stranger they will not follow do you see David knew that kind of can you imagine that Jesus sent on a regular blazes with Lazarus and Mary and Martha and Lazarus become to know the voice of Jesus and Jesus was the good shepherd he was the door of the sheepfold him one day the devil come and took the life of Lazarus and Jesus was four days away from him and could have made it on time but brother Brandon said God amen gave him a vision and he let him actually pass before he ever went to where he was by the time he got there you would have thought he was four days late but brother Brennan said with Martha Menand Amen she wasn't mad at him she only said lord if he would have been here he wouldn't have died Amen but jesus said Martha I am I am the resurrection and the life you see I thought I was but I will be I am the resurrection and the life amen and he that believeth in me shall never die Martha and Martha said I know I know I know he will raise at the last day she said he said no Martha go move the stone don't move the stone Martha brother BAM said you think he couldn't have moved that stone with his pinkie you don't think he couldn't have just brushed that stone away with his pinky he said but he let her do it to give her a part in the miracle and when she rolled back that stove brother Brendan said he stood there at the grave for days cold the body was already in corruption but the Wren said his life is four days journey but the master stood at the side and said Lazarus come out of there and Lazarus was a sheep and Jesus's voice touched Lazarus worried walk come on church he was down there in paradise having a good time with the family he had a lot of people over there but in the middle of it he heard something he said you all hear that they said no we didn't hear that he said yeah somebody's caught whoa it's the master it's the Masters calling it's the master he's calling you know the prophet of God said he said if he hadn't a said Lazarus every one of them would have come out of that grave but he called him by name because he was proven he was the Shepherd of the sheep called Lazarus and corruption had to give back his body corruption had already run off and God said no put it back where you got it hey many corruption had to turn around and put the body back death had to give up the life and God brought him up out of that grave and the power of his resurrection to prove he wants to hold a shower job husha the ship of the Lord our Shepherd he began to prove to over a halt and when he began to prove that what's now amen he proved that with him showing I am actually the Shepherd of the people nothing's going to come unless he lets it do you see because watch now anytime something comes and gets a sheep who goes after it the Shepherd and David knew that the Lord was his shepherd and he said you hide my soul in hell make my bed in hell he'll find me there it doesn't matter where you put me amen you can't put me out of his reach he knew he was his Shepherd yeah now I'm talking about the God that I'm serving here tonight not the god of history he was the Shepherd of David insolence that David acted like his master he was an amateur Shepherd and one day a lion coming down a sheep one day a line coming down his sheep and you know what he wouldn't do he wouldn't just let it go he was just a little faith he didn't have no ability he wasn't a lawyer he was a boy Amen he was a singer and a shepherd he wasn't a warrior Amen but he stood there and saw that's my daddy sheep amen and they have come and took it and he went after that line I'll tell you what I just read a quote last night brother mem said this he said David didn't know how he would get it back he just knew he was going after he didn't know what weapon he would use he didn't know how he would kill a line but he was going after it because it was his job to go after it and you know what he found out when he come to the challenge that was an anointing on him and he slayed that line like it was a little kitten not because of his might not because of his power he was operating under the office a man that he was a shepherd under the office of God Oh Church of the Living God amen you see God didn't change his mind because a few days later a bear a bear coming down a little sheep amen and David didn't just say it's just one sheep it's just one little sheep David didn't have that heart because his father didn't have that heart and David said I can't lose one of them and he took off after that bear like it was just a little cow amen he took off after that bear not knowing how he would do it are you hearing me he didn't know how he would kill no prayer but he knew this bears gotta die because that's God's sheep he's got a hold up and when he went to do the job that was an anointing setting on him amen the God of Abraham setting around him the God that was able to change things settle around him and he killed that bear and he walked away from there with a couple experiences in him and a few days later he went to pull him out and an entire camp was setting in fear and he looked around and saw the King Saul sitting there and saw the army and he looked around there and they all said Oh David you're up here trying to make you know you're just up here getting into trouble and David went over and began to tell about his experience with God he began to tell about his experience was with God and he happened to be standing there winged alive come out and said hey man send over somebody to fight amen and the littlest guy the littlest guy in the army the littlest guy in the camp of Israel he wasn't even in the army he happened to hear that --gel I say Amen that he can whip the camp of Israel and that little fella said look if my God will kill align and kill a bear over a sheep who is his son circumcised Philistine who thinks he can defy the armies of the Living God there was something rose up hitting he didn't know how he would kill a Goliath he didn't know how he would kill a child but he knew this he was gonna die trying he knew he would face that thing he would face it toe to toe brother van and said I'm gonna take David's place tonight he said listen God's got some sheep out here and he started naming the problems in their lives and he said God hey I don't know how I'm gonna do it but I'm gonna throw a rock at it I'm gonna throw a stone at it come on church you know the story it's a it's a simple story remember but you know what David knew God was the shepherd and David went down there and heard Goliath and he actually took a life he said look now ghal I said I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna cut your head off and I'm gonna feed you to the birds you're just a kid you've got no right challenging me amen but David knew whose seed he was he was at the seed of Abraham and every time to life cursed him but curse was going right back up holy they meant so I imagine he said go ahead Goliath run your mouth some more because everything you're saying it's only building me a weapon to tear you down because now you're not coming against me as a person you're coming against the God that I serve amen and the Bible said he that blesses you shall be blessed and he that curses you shall be cursed and that Goliath began to curse God's anointed amen and look look what he done David went down there and got anointed a mint and run down to the brook and found five smooth stones yeah yeah now y'all know a man that them five smooth stones is Jes he picked up Jesus let me let me say this to you if you're gonna go and battle with a Goliath stop by and pick up Jesus if you're gonna face a devil a man first picked up Jesus pick up Jesus because Jesus can't defeat every girl I [Applause] picked up five stones that's a giant out in front of me had five he had four brothers on the hill young all the stories hey man he picked up them five stones and brother Ron hey man he picked up them stones and so happened maybe somebody had give him a real nice sling he was cash laying that morning amen and when them five stones hit his hands he said then will fit my weapon I'm used to this I didn't kill the line with it doesn't kill the bear with it hey man I tell you what just get that child just get him out there good and somebody said he's great big so that's all right he'll make an easy target the bigger they are the harder they fall the bigger the devil the greater the testimony now y'all know fakers by accident that man picked up stones to you but the all knowin hadn't been but a few years before that that Joshua had come through that same land and Joshua was taken over the territories who was he taking it from Giants and one day he got into battle with five kings and what's now when those five kings were put in the cave and the armies begin to run and what did joshua do he spoke to the son and he said son stand still in other words don't let them Devils hide now keep the light on them because we're not gonna stop with one we're gonna kill every devil in our sight No then you say how was Josh so we're gonna kill all them devils when he stopped that stunned by the spoken word my Bible says that God began to rain stones out of heaven God started throwing rocks at dulles enemy he started slaying tax God God Jehovah Shepard was slaying Giants with rocks so David found five of them same rocks they meant that Joshua had seen in his stay and picked them up he said these are giant killing rocks right here I don't have to be a good shot these are designed to kill Devils these are missiles missile these are heat-seeking missiles that's a ballistic on this rock come on church ballistics are powerful aren't they ballistics on that rock and he begin to swing when you release that rock that rock knew where it was going because God had designed that rock to kill Devils with and tonight there's a rock that rock is Jesus and this the same one that took over hell and today that same name is available you say you say oh my preacher what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that we might not understand we might not understand how we're gonna kill this devil but we're gonna fight him we're not backing off with no Devils we're not backing away hey man I'll tell you this amen amen I'll tell you this amen that old devil amen pick their own cellar I heard last Sunday night I heard last Sunday night let me tell you something y'all got a man for a pastor no man for a pastor that was no it's a man not just a man of God cold man and this devil might be coming but brother he's got a fight on his hands every child every message preacher every pastor every son and daughter of God will throw a rock in the Bible what will the throw rocks can we kill this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] tonight it's not a time to quit it's a time to fight if you don't have a bullet full of rock if you don't have a rock threw a spear said boleyn what you saying I'm saying take your guitar and beat the devil down take your piano sister and beat ever devil take that singing deal may be another devil take that rich and gift and be never devil take ever testimony you know it's gonna rain hail stones and Hill tonight as the sons and daughters of God upon morning hail with the prayers of the saints oh brother you see we got a shepherd with us we're not just a we're not just a bunch of silly people we've got a God that bonus is with us who is God our God is God [Music] Jeremih since the Lord is our righteousness said preacher I don't know I need some righteousness let me tell you your righteousness is tonight it's God if you start leaning on your own righteousness you're not going to be effective in this battle if you're saying I did this and I didn't do this and I did this and I didn't do this you will be rendered ineffective as a warrior but if you'll say I am righteous because God made me righteous I am sinless because God made me sinless I don't have to back up because the secret sin I don't have to back up because of someone confess something or something the devil's gonna come up with later that's the devil's trick do you know that I know politics enough to know who's the god of politics is Satan and Satan will actually let something hide in your life ain't meant that way when you meet a challenge he can whisper in your ear I'm gonna tell on you and about the time you start to fight I'm gonna tell on you and he sucks the strength right out of you you know what I told him I said then why I told on myself God knows everything there is to know about me you tell him anything you wanna tell him he's already forgiven me after the blood of Jesus Christ we should stand up to the devil tonight we're not hiding we're not hiding we're the children of God and were righteous by the blood of God tonight [Music] I know the devil thinks he's about goddess but we got more in us than that [Applause] now you gonna say preacher you keep talking about blog new meme healer and righteousness needs all these things well let me tell you what there's something there's something just one more that makes all of them more powerful and that's in Ezekiel 48 and 35 he said I'm around 18,000 measures in the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there and this is where God gained the name of Jehovah Shama which means that he is the God that is there amen let me say we just meet he is ever-present he's actually there I mean what good would it be for him to be the shepherd if the shepherd ain't here what good would it be to you if the inner wasn't here what good would it be for deliverer if the deliverer wasn't here what good would a miracle work at me if he wasn't here but our God is also known as jehova shamma in other words he is here now listen he's right here in this building right now he said yet a little while and the world shall see me no more but you shall see me for I will be with you even in you until the end of the age Amen he is our God and he is here right laughs Amen he is not coming on the scene he is right now in this building he is right here right now you say preacher where is he he's in the tabernacle of the bride of Jesus Christ and the prophet of God said he's right here right now tabernacled in a body now you say what are you trying to say I'm trying to say that our God our Lord our Jesus is right here in this place right now now you say Amen you know I can't remember all these names I can't either I had to write them down actually but do you know in the middle of this Bible God doesn't something wonderful all this and he actually caused Mary to have a child and he changed God changed his name from Jehovah to Jesus so every time you say the name Jesus you have invoked every power that is tied to the name of God you can't save Jesus without calling a healer on the scene you can't say Jesus without having to deliver on the scene if you say Jesus you see every redemptive name is tied up in that name Jesus see that's why when you say Jesus it means Jehovah Savior amen do you see what it is his name Jesus is Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Savior now the importance of this name of course the first time that it was ever spoken human lives Amen John actually leapt for joy in the womb of his mother a baby who was in the womb without any movement amen a baby dead in the womb no movement for six months but under one name the name of Jesus Mary said he jumped for joy within me you said what are you talking about preacher I say John was the first shatter of the New Testament the name Jesus was so powerful even the babies in the womb had to rejoice at the sound of that name because they knew now healing and salvation and deliverance and anointing was coming upon the earth in that name in the precious name of Jesus Christ you see that name of Jesus has power and you can't tell me I don't have power you know I haven't haven't I happen to have the the blessing not kids you could say of having in the last six seven years been real close to brother Ron and the family here and and brother Pruett down in Louisiana and brother Ron I've shared a lot of meetings together and you know what we've whipped a lot of devils together I guarantee you if you go down to hell they know the name I bet you don't have to say it twice you say Ron Spencer they know who you're talking about we were together in a meeting last year and in the fall in October on a Saturday morning and I'd already come out and set on the platform and in a minute brother Ron brother Tim come out and sat down and brother Michael Dexter I think was leading songs that morning and he began to tell a testimony about a bunch of about some people that was on a boat with brother Branham and they were going down a river y'all remember the testimony they're going down the river and they hit a bought it was a log amen and then the couple thought it was a log and after they hit the bump but the brown was telling them I think they were bearing with me on the couple on the boat and they were bearing and and the Prophet told them said no that wasn't the log you bumped into that was actually an angel and he was coming to bring to pass your prayer that you wanted to have a child mr. Baris was gonna leave you when they said that man was a presence come on that platform and brother on me elbow brother Tim they was all talking back and forth I knew it's good I could feel it if I said that's good I don't know what hours later so at the end the service we get on the back and brother on Sabri Lane the angel the Lord met me in the bathroom said the angel the presence of God was back there and told me that tonight was Esther's night and sister Esther but the Tim's daughter been married 16 years has been has been looking for a baby been desired to have a child have been praying and asking God for 16 years well in that meeting brother Ron said well Amy said tonight is Esther's night and we had a prayer line this alone prayer line and Bella Ron he was right there he was praying he was praying and just as soon as Esther come through the line he turned around and left and brother agen actually asked me said what take brother Ron's place and so we continued the prayer line but he was finished because he was been standing there waiting on Esther that whole time well you do y'all know that that was a solid year and what four months now a year and four months we'll all Wednesday night they announced down in Louisiana that sister Esther and brother is actually expecting a baby now [Applause] do you know God could have given that baby a year ago but why do you think God would waiting here in four months to show you a miracle working God right in the middle of this great trial to let you know this didn't sneak up on God but God knew this was coming and designed the miracle right in the middle of it to tell y'all amen I am steel God he's still gone I'm not I'm not a crazy man I was preaching one time in the service amen I'm preaching away and I start talking about a woman and I said look sister I don't care what you've done I don't care what I don't care what the problem is or something of that nature and I said your body might not want to have a baby Amen but God changed Sarah's body to have a baby hey Ben God changed the very body of Sarah so she could conceive and have a child and I thought it was strange when I said it but about a year later nearly Bryce Collins and his wife Stephanie comes down to Arkansas and stiff Stephanie walks up with a baby and said brother Lane here's that baby you said I could have I said I didn't know I even said that she said you told me that God can even change my inner body that I could have another baby and she said I took it as a word of the Lord uess what are you saying I'm saying God is still God I'm saying that miracle working God is right here in this building right now he is the God of Abraham of God of Isaac and the John of Jacob and he has given to you the name of Jesus Christ he's given to you to use that name of Jesus Christ before every trial before every problem that you meet you have the name of Jesus now you got to think about that name tonight that name of Jesus he meant it is as the very rod that was in the hand of Moses when Moses held up that rod oceans moved when Moses held up that rod rocks give out water when Moses held up that rod amen manna rained out of the heavens when Moses held up that rod things begin to happen because there was something in that rod that had been given to Moses for the deliverance of God's people and tonight God didn't give you a rod he gave you the name of Jesus Christ you can raise up that name in front of every Red Sea in front of every parent moon in front of every sick body and for the beverage problem in your marriage and say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ do you see there is an authority in that name now there's a story told of David Livingstone closed very quickly as a story told the David Livingstone in the Bible or in the history books when David Livingstone went to Italy Africa and he was going to be a missionary he knew that he couldn't make it through Africa alive because of all the tribes but God gave that man enough wisdom to go to a certain tribe and he made a made a covenant with one of the high priests in that in Africa and when he did he made a blood covenant with him and they had this exchange tokens and when they did the priests the the African tribe leader chief told him said I want that white coach away so David Livingstone gave him his white coat and he said look mr. Livingstone you can get anything I've got you can have it he said well what I want is that sacred spear you carry so David got that sacred spear and kept it in his hand and then when he begin to travel Africa and he would come up to a to a tribe that was warrior tribes when he started your approaches a white man they'd come out of one and kill him well all he would do was hold up that spirit well when he held up that spear it spoke that there's a covenant with one of their kings and they had to honor that covenant because he was in possession of that spirit the Church of the Living God is in a covenant with Almighty God and God has given you the name of Jesus Christ and when the devil comes all you have to do is hold up that name and Satan comes in the name of Jesus Christ do you see what it is it's a power over and ever devil because there is no name above the name of Jesus Christ listen tonight we could stand here and we could name every name in the Bible but there is no name like the name of Jesus we can name Paul we can name change we can name John we can name Peter we can make Moses Abraham whoever they are but nobody's like that name Jesus come on church a ment but if that be true about God's people how much greater then it's the name of Jesus Christ that every devil you can name whatever devil you can name Jesus Christ is above that devil tonight and that devil is under your feet I don't know how we're gonna do it but I'll tell you this you gotta ride tonight to charge every devil in hell and say Satan you're in my way I'm a child of God and I'm coming after you oh my because your God is God your God He is God it said brother Wayne man I think you're getting us in trouble I think you're building a bunch of false hope I think you're getting us in trouble do you know that's what Georgie Carter's mom told brother branham said you know what you're doing you're coming around here building this girl up a false hope and you know what her hope wasn't false her hope was building a name and it was not the name of William Branham her hope was built in the name of Jesus Christ because she had read in her Bible that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that was a little girl who laid nine years on the bed nine years she laid on the bed but she heard about the miracle working God who was working miracles through William branham's ministry and she began to pray that that God would send the man to her house who would pray over her and her mother thought she was crazy she wasn't crazy she was Abraham's seed still remain to be gone he's the thought that controls the the law y'all know the story brother man was out in solid vision that maybe getting up and walking and when he started off to Georgie's house and come knocking her mama actually was praying that that imposter would go away that that man would move and she seen the shadow come across the wall and it was a prophet he was being led by Jesus Christ and all of a sudden and not come at the door and there brother Branham was at her door and when she went in there she realized that Jesus had led that man there and he come up to that bed a hopeless case a troubled case there was no way it could happen after nine years how could this change I'm preaching to you some of you've got troubles you've been holding a long time that's been situations how could he change after nine solid years but a profit by vision a profit by vision since said little Georgie rise above that bed and the prophet of God said she turned over and put her little feet on the ground and she stood up by the power of Jesus Christ she didn't stand by her own power she stood by the power of Jesus Christ that was the power in her that allowed her to stand in an hour when there was no hope now I don't know how much you've studied Georgie Carter it's a powerful story though because you know what brother Ram said she done immediately when she was healed she jumped over on that piano and started playing she jumped over and started playing that piano and she started worshipping God what was going on over there you know you know what really was happening brother Branham said that's what she was doing before she got in that shape she was actually on her way to a piano lesson when her uncle raped her and put her in that condition and caused TB by the abuse she had had but when the name of Jesus come on amen he didn't only cause her to walk again he took away the crippled nosov that abuse that had been in her life and she went back to living the life she was meant to live let me tell you that Devils come by to abused you and you but in the name of Jesus Christ it's time for the church they meant to stand and say Satan you careless in the house of God you can't hold us maybe you're sitting here tonight the problems in your life they meant situations as we know you said I don't know how it still not happen amen I'm when I started this service I don't know I don't know how things are gonna go but I know this I know God told me you go get me sheep you go get my sheep that's all I know go get the sheep and it's up to God to do the work it's up to God to kill the glass it's up to God to cause Georgie to walk it's up to God to st. souls and fill them with the Holy Ghost listen what do you do then I'll tell you what I'm good I'm preaching the gospel my commission do you know the Bible said but the devil sins Devils that's his job but it's my job a meant to send them back it's my job by the gospel to tell that devil tonight you got no place in this building you got no place in here as the authority as a commission that son of God Satan I charge you to leave this building tonight and every spirit of unbelief and every spirit of criticism be broken in the power of God now y'all I tell you just preaching this if you think it's not much but let me take this right over here in Virginia I was preaching one day just like this and it was a man jumped up he's sitting about where you are a man jumped up and he said brother Lawson he said I can't help it I got to testify he said the cancer has just dropped off of my body I never touched it but by the power of the preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ that cancer died but in the middle of the service my wife's granddaddy was sitting about where you are in a service and heard a man testifying how God can heal and he was sitting over the skin cancer on his arm and when the man said God still heals cancer the cancer fell off in the floor right in the middle of the church you're living in a season or anything as possible at any moment in any time the God that were serving he's able to do anything at all that he's so desires [Applause] do you know God still raises the dead you ken Boyer come here and testify didn't he I was on the other end of that testimony and one of God's servants was laying there drawing his last breath my son was standing there and his son was there and his Deacon was there and I simply reached over and put my hand on him and I said father this is a pastor his church needs him in the name of Jesus Christ would you touch the man and give him his life and he stood up off the ground and begin to worship God my son went on to be an RN you know when he told me the other day said dad he said since that time he said I've brought several people back to life he said it's an RN he said lots of nights people down on the tables he said I bring him back he said but usually the ribs is all crushed he said usually they lost brain cells he said usually it takes a mile some months he said I've yet to bring one back to life it jumped up and started worshipping God he said but when God does it he does it differently listen friends your God He is God music players come tonight you said brother Wayne what can we do about it what can we do with this devil how many of yous facing battle right now got things going on you said bro Wayne look now I know this sounds odd but brother Brennan said this directly he said you are dealing with a defeated enemy Satan is a bluff you are dealing with a defeated enemy a you so why the world would God allow [Music] before you started fine with it God defeated him he knew senior in your life you think while I'm find this find this giant of a devil and I don't know but before God ever turned the thing loose he defeated he became over he defeated sickness he defeated Lee gravely defeated death he conquered every temptation but he said but now your father I don't know any better way to say it I I don't know if I've told
