[40:59] Thanksgiving from a True Heart A
[41:00] Grateful heart into our and to our
[41:03] Heavenly Father who is always for his
[41:05] children and he's so diligent to take

[41:45] not to put you to sleep but we're very
[41:47] thankful to have all of our visitors

[42:06] uh it's a blessing to have Eli if you if
[42:09] you haven't been around Eli it's uh
[42:10] he'll be a real blessing to you I think
[42:13] he's trying his best to get in this

[42:21] right I was gonna say we vote you in

[42:26] certainly brother Eli was able to share
[42:28] some of his testimony with us a couple
[42:30] weeks ago and uh it was it was it was
[42:33] truly a real blessing to us and and the
[42:36] bride there and that portion of the
[42:38] Bride that was there to able to hear
[42:39] that and I believe all of our young
[42:41] people have a very powerful testimony
[42:42] whether they've gone through something
[42:44] or not just to be standing in the middle
[42:46] of laodicea it's a real blessing and I
[42:49] got this note uh just before we come to

[42:54] the Family's last name but it was just a
[42:57] little note that came
[42:58] to the church please remember a little
[43:01] Jack he's dealing with a high
[43:03] temperature and he's very sick and
[43:05] wherever they are they're in the middle
[43:07] of a snowstorming and having a hard time
[43:10] getting to the hospital and different
[43:11] things and they're just asking that
[43:13] Jesus would put his foot on the brown of
[43:15] the boat again and and just calm the
[43:17] storm in their life there and I know
[43:19] God's more than able to touch a little
[43:21] Jack tonight and I believe he's more
[43:23] than able to touch each and every one of
[43:24] our lives here tonight and and we're
[43:27] just uh we just want to be remembering
[43:28] little Jack when we go to prayer maybe

[48:25] weapon that is formed against us that
[48:27] shall prosper we recognize that every
[48:30] enemy has to Bow before the name of the
[48:32] Lord Jesus Christ and we gathered in

[50:31] Christ
[50:31] [Music]
[50:34] if you have your Bibles this evening
[50:35] would like to look over in the Book of
[50:37] Psalms chapter 139. verse 4 and then
[50:41] also Genesis chapter 14.
[50:44] Psalms 139
[50:50] .
[51:19] amen
[51:20] Psalms 139 and verse 4.
[51:24] for there is not a word in my tongue but
[51:27] Lo O Lord thou knowest it all together
[51:31] thou has beset me behind and before and
[51:35] laid thine hand upon me
[51:37] such knowledge is too wonderful for me
[51:39] it is high and I cannot attain it
[51:42] wither shall I go from thy Spirit or
[51:45] whether shall I flee from thy presence
[51:48] if I Ascend up into the heavens Thou Art
[51:51] there
[51:52] if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art
[51:56] there if I take the wings of the morning
[51:58] and dwell in the uttermost parts of the
[52:01] sea even there shall thy hand Lead Me
[52:04] and thy right hand that shall hold me if
[52:07] I say surely the darkness shall cover me
[52:09] even the night shall be light about me
[52:12] yea the darkness hideth not from thee
[52:15] but the night shineth as the day the
[52:17] darkness and the light are both a light
[52:19] to thee for thou has possessed my Reigns
[52:23] that word Reigns it literally means the
[52:26] kidneys it is it denotes the very inward
[52:29] part of the of the being it it denotes
[52:32] the mind the soul the seat of our
[52:35] desires our affections our passions for
[52:38] thou Hast possessed my inward being that
[52:42] word possessed it means to stand up it
[52:45] means to it means to erect it means to
[52:47] set up right that God has possessed he's
[52:50] owned and he is the one that made the
[52:53] very inward parts of your being he owned
[52:56] them he made them therefore he knows all
[52:59] about you
[53:01] for thou has possessed my Reigns thou
[53:04] has covered me in my mother's womb I
[53:06] will praise thee for I am fearfully and
[53:09] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[53:12] and that my soul knoweth the right well
[53:15] Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18.
[53:20] at Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[53:24] forth Bread and Wine and he was the
[53:26] priest of the most high God and he
[53:29] blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of
[53:31] the most high god possessor of Heaven
[53:34] and Earth and blessed be the most high
[53:37] God which hath delivered thine enemies
[53:40] into thy hand and he gave him tithes of
[53:45] all may God bless his word he may be
[53:47] seated in the presence of the Lord this
[53:48] evening
[53:50] I would like to by the help of the Lord
[53:52] begin to speak to you again on this
[53:54] thought of of Abraham blessed blessed by
[53:58] the most high God we recognize that that
[54:01] in the beginning God was not necessarily
[54:04] God like we would describe him because
[54:06] God has the meaning of an object of
[54:09] worship so in the very beginning we
[54:11] recognize that God was not God as he was
[54:14] but he was Elohim but we recognize for
[54:17] him to be God he has to be worshiped so
[54:19] we recognize that the very first thing
[54:21] that God had created in the beginning
[54:23] God created angels because God loves to
[54:27] be worshiped but we know that he is a
[54:30] self-existing one and we recognize that
[54:32] no matter what name our Lord Jesus
[54:34] Christ would declare himself he alone is
[54:38] a self-existing one each of us this desk
[54:41] is not self-existing this this these
[54:43] chairs or these carpet or this building
[54:45] is not self-existing it cannot go on the
[54:49] in the shape that it is unless a man
[54:51] takes care of it but God is
[54:53] self-existing he doesn't need he doesn't
[54:55] need the help of angels to exist he does
[54:58] not need the help of humanity to exist
[55:01] no matter whether you go by the way of
[55:03] the Grave or by the way of the Rapture
[55:05] God does not need your Humanity to exist
[55:08] God does not need the devil to exist God
[55:12] is the self-existing one that means he's
[55:15] the only one and he is the highest above
[55:18] everything that ever can be and we
[55:21] recognize that God is he's not he's not
[55:23] coming he's not going but he is here he
[55:26] is in this room because we recognize
[55:29] where two or three are gathered in my
[55:31] name there I will be in the midst of
[55:33] them so we recognize that deity is in
[55:36] this building tonight and is manifesting
[55:38] himself in Sons and Daughters of God
[55:41] that have been called by his name that
[55:43] have dressed himself in the power of His
[55:46] Holiness and we recognize that God is
[55:49] here and you are blessed to be able to
[55:52] be called the children of the most high
[55:55] God I'm going to just go through a few
[55:57] things again kind of give you a little
[55:58] bit of review but we recognize that the
[56:01] name El eleon is translated in the Bible
[56:03] the most high God it is hell is
[56:07] shortened from from the form of Elohim
[56:10] which speaks of God's strength Elion
[56:13] therefore is the strongest or the strong
[56:16] one uh or the most high God so we
[56:19] recognize that when we begin to begin to
[56:21] look into the text uh that the Bible
[56:24] interprets that this is to mean that El
[56:27] eleon is the possessor of Heaven and
[56:30] Earth so Elian Knows No Limits he is
[56:33] Elian is the most high God and He Knows
[56:37] No Limits you and I are bound up by
[56:40] limits but God is not bound by limits we
[56:43] are bound by speed limits or we would go
[56:45] as fast as we want to we are bound in
[56:48] humanity or we would fly like the wings
[56:50] of a dove or we would Fly Like an Eagle
[56:53] or we would or we would set our wings
[56:55] and we would go at a different course
[56:57] because you and I have a limits you see
[57:00] there are certain things about certain
[57:02] people that they can say certain things
[57:04] and you see there's a mother that could
[57:06] that that can say a certain thing about
[57:08] you and there are certain things that
[57:10] only people can only certain people can
[57:13] say my mother is the only one that has
[57:16] the ability to be able to make a
[57:18] statement I carried you for nine months
[57:20] my father did not do that so he cannot
[57:22] make that statement she said I've heard
[57:25] her say before I brought you into this
[57:27] world and I can take you out of this
[57:29] world she has the ability to make a
[57:31] statement like that you see it there Joe
[57:34] Biden right now only he has the ability
[57:37] to make a statement that I am the
[57:39] President of the United States in
[57:42] another two or three years somebody else
[57:43] might be able to say it but there are
[57:45] certain ways where people only certain
[57:48] people have the ability to make certain
[57:50] statements and Jesus is the only one
[57:53] that can make certain statements there's
[57:55] been no other God there's been no other
[57:58] Pope there's been no other potentate
[58:00] that's been able to say that I Lay My
[58:02] Life down and I'll raise it up again he
[58:05] is the only one that can say that I am
[58:07] the resurrection and I am the life you
[58:10] destroy this Temple and in three days I
[58:13] raise it back up again he alone is only
[58:16] to make a statement like that because
[58:17] he's always able to back up what he said
[58:20] and if God has said one thing about his
[58:23] children he is more than able he's more
[58:26] than enough he's strong enough to take
[58:28] care of his words he he you see made a
[58:32] promise because he's God and God is
[58:34] immutable he cannot change and he cannot
[58:37] waver if God has thought about you God
[58:41] cannot change his thought about you for
[58:44] the two immutable things cannot be done
[58:46] away with he confirmed it with an oath
[58:48] God is God
[58:50] and he backed up his word while lifting
[58:53] up his hands towards heaven and putting
[58:56] his foot onto the sea and upon the Earth
[58:58] and you as the pillar of Fire have the
[59:01] devil underneath of your feet tonight
[59:09] I know I'm way ahead of myself but I
[59:12] want to say his sons and daughters of
[59:13] God every Cancer is underneath of your
[59:16] feet every diocese is underneath of your
[59:18] feet you are children of the most high
[59:21] God I'll say there's no weapon that is
[59:24] formed against this church
[59:26] that shall prosper
[59:29] he knows no limits
[59:31] you see the authority and the power of
[59:33] the most high God surpasses it goes
[59:36] beyond the Reigns of Nations
[59:38] his Reigns of the most high God goes
[59:41] beyond heaven and it goes beyond the
[59:43] Earth his range goes beyond every Power
[59:46] his range goes beyond every principality
[59:49] his range goes beyond every Angel and it
[59:53] goes beyond every figure of humanity his
[59:56] authority is a most high God and
[59:58] Dominion's Fantasia spend time and
[1:00:02] distance alike so he alone is done
[1:00:05] deserving of the title higher than the
[1:00:08] highest and the champion of champions
[1:00:11] you see he knows no limits and he knows
[1:00:14] no bounds he knows no restrictions and
[1:00:18] every demon power has to be limited
[1:00:21] under the unlimited God
[1:00:24] there is no restraint with our God there
[1:00:27] is no holdbacks with our God I want you
[1:00:30] to recognize that you as Earthbound
[1:00:32] people we have limits Upon Us unless we
[1:00:35] get in a plane we cannot fly unless we
[1:00:38] get in a rocket we can't go past the
[1:00:40] Moon
[1:00:42] but our God man has tried its very best
[1:00:45] to get past the moon but our God owns
[1:00:48] past the moon and Beyond every Galaxy
[1:00:50] Beyond every Star and Beyond every orbit
[1:00:54] that there is our God is the possessor
[1:00:57] of Heaven and Earth
[1:01:00] foreign
[1:01:02] there is no power
[1:01:04] there is no power and no one that does
[1:01:07] not fall under our God's domain and his
[1:01:11] jurisdiction there's nobody that is out
[1:01:13] underneath of his law and his actions as
[1:01:16] almighty God even the Nickelodeon spirit
[1:01:19] that is going about trying to divide and
[1:01:22] to conquer the laity is under the power
[1:01:25] and this jurisdiction of almighty God
[1:01:28] Judas was under the authority of
[1:01:31] almighty God he could not kiss the Son
[1:01:34] of God unless the Son of God would allow
[1:01:36] him to kiss him the pope cannot have any
[1:01:39] power unless almighty God gives it to
[1:01:42] him he can sit there as a viker of
[1:01:45] Christ and can say and act and try to
[1:01:47] dispose of the Holy Spirit but only the
[1:01:51] almighty God is powerful enough to
[1:01:54] forgive us of our sins
[1:01:56] the pope you ain't gotta buy your way
[1:01:59] into heaven you ain't gotta buy your
[1:02:01] loved ones out of heaven or Out of Hell
[1:02:03] there is one name and there is one power
[1:02:07] that has the ability to save you the
[1:02:10] ability to retain you and the ability to
[1:02:12] redeem you
[1:02:16] I believe that you're acquainted with
[1:02:18] this name
[1:02:19] and we will not stand for any Pope we
[1:02:22] will not stand for any fighter but we
[1:02:24] will stand for Jesus
[1:02:27] yeah
[1:02:28] isn't God's Plan of Redemption just
[1:02:31] truly magnificent
[1:02:32] to begin to think that the almighty God
[1:02:34] will become flesh and become deboned and
[1:02:38] dwell amongst us for the purpose of
[1:02:40] restoring mankind do we restoring The
[1:02:43] Fellowship of mankind back with almighty
[1:02:46] God there is there is notice that God
[1:02:49] revealed himself to Abraham and in
[1:02:52] different characteristics of himself he
[1:02:55] declared or revealed himself to Abraham
[1:02:57] as the almighty God El shadiyah as the
[1:03:01] all strong one you see if you're
[1:03:04] Almighty you are the strongest
[1:03:07] foreign
[1:03:09] if you're omnipotent that means you're
[1:03:12] all powerful
[1:03:13] and he is the omniscient one and he is
[1:03:16] the omnipresent one so there is no limit
[1:03:19] that you can go to in this world as
[1:03:22] David said in Psalms 139 if I go to the
[1:03:25] heavens Thou Art there and if I go to
[1:03:27] hell Thou Art there you see there's no
[1:03:30] limits to him but notice that he he
[1:03:32] declared himself as hell Shady eye he
[1:03:35] declared himself as Jehovah Jireh the
[1:03:37] Lord who provides he declared himself as
[1:03:40] Elohim he declared himself as El Elion
[1:03:43] the most high but notice that Abraham
[1:03:46] did not receive him as three or four
[1:03:48] different gods but Abraham recognized
[1:03:51] that there was only one God that was
[1:03:53] declaring himself through many different
[1:03:56] conveys of God's message he was
[1:03:59] conveying to Abraham of where he was
[1:04:03] you know there's certain times in your
[1:04:06] life when you've got peace when you've
[1:04:08] got peace but he's Jehovah's Hammer to
[1:04:11] you but you see you see there's
[1:04:14] sometimes when you need he's Jehovah
[1:04:17] Shalom if he's if he's your peace but
[1:04:19] sometimes you need the Lord right there
[1:04:21] so he declares himself as Jehovah's
[1:04:24] Shama
[1:04:25] you see there's sometimes in your life
[1:04:27] you need a victory and there's sometimes
[1:04:29] you need a banner that sometimes and God
[1:04:32] knows how to show up to your need
[1:04:35] but notice Abraham Abraham didn't
[1:04:38] recognize the one that was speaking to
[1:04:40] him as three deities or three Gods but
[1:04:43] he recognized that it was a same voice
[1:04:45] the voice behind the voice that was
[1:04:48] speaking to him at Jehovah Jireh up in
[1:04:51] Genesis 22. he was Melchizedek what that
[1:04:54] was the same voice that was speaking to
[1:04:56] him in Genesis 14. it was the same God
[1:04:58] that was speaking to him in Genesis 12.
[1:05:01] it was the same God that was speaking to
[1:05:03] him in Genesis 17. what was he doing God
[1:05:06] was taking Abraham through justification
[1:05:09] sanctification and on to the baptism of
[1:05:12] the Holy Ghost what was it it was the
[1:05:15] blessings of almighty God being poured
[1:05:18] out in the dispensation of Abraham
[1:05:22] but notice notice that that God would
[1:05:25] use different names or titles as he
[1:05:27] would begin to convey his message to his
[1:05:30] people because there are different
[1:05:32] characteristics to certain names
[1:05:35] each of you know what your name means
[1:05:38] you have a certain day or certain
[1:05:40] characteristics that go with that name
[1:05:43] you see the name Andrew means manly
[1:05:48] and there's one lady that knows that's
[1:05:50] right
[1:05:53] and I know that's right there ain't one
[1:05:56] thing
[1:05:57] let me go on it I'm preaching about
[1:05:59] Jehovah not me
[1:06:02] but every
[1:06:08] met the character and he gave the name
[1:06:11] to the animal according to the character
[1:06:13] that it had and when God would show up
[1:06:16] and he would declare himself in his
[1:06:18] seven compound names or his seven
[1:06:20] redemptives names as we went through of
[1:06:23] Jehovah Shema Jehovah Jireh Jehovah
[1:06:25] Nishi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah's Hammer
[1:06:28] the Jehovah and we recognize that when
[1:06:31] God would declare himself in those seven
[1:06:34] compound names it was his it was showing
[1:06:37] to us as his children his attitude
[1:06:40] towards his people all the way back
[1:06:43] there in Eden and all the way from Eden
[1:06:45] back you see everything everything that
[1:06:48] is for you is wrapped up in those seven
[1:06:51] compound names you see those seven
[1:06:54] compound names is his attitude towards
[1:06:57] you I say to you he is Jehovah he is
[1:07:01] your healer he is Jehovah shama he is
[1:07:04] there he is Jehovah's Shalom he is your
[1:07:10] I want you to think I really want you to
[1:07:14] put some thought process into this next
[1:07:15] statement I'm going to make to you I
[1:07:17] want you to think about your hardest
[1:07:19] problem
[1:07:21] I want you to think about your biggest
[1:07:24] need
[1:07:25] can you do that for yourself just for a
[1:07:27] minute take a take a second while I
[1:07:29] catch a breath and begin to think about
[1:07:31] my biggest need
[1:07:35] my biggest desire
[1:07:41] every one of you've got a different need
[1:07:44] foreign
[1:07:48] there are certain things brother Jerry
[1:07:49] has need of that maybe I don't have need
[1:07:51] of
[1:07:55] I want you to think of it
[1:07:57] reflect on it just for a moment
[1:08:00] think how big it is
[1:08:02] there's some of you that have maybe
[1:08:03] minuscule needs right now that you are
[1:08:06] thinking about or is crossing your mind
[1:08:08] but the Bible tells us he supplies all
[1:08:12] of our needs
[1:08:14] you think there's over 250 people that
[1:08:16] are sitting here tonight
[1:08:17] there's no way humanly that anybody here
[1:08:20] could meet all of your needs but there's
[1:08:22] somebody bigger than the humanity that
[1:08:25] is in this room now I want you to notice
[1:08:27] this what brother Brandon says here in
[1:08:29] Jesus Christ same yesterday today and
[1:08:30] forever he said when you try to confine
[1:08:32] God to one little denomination or one
[1:08:34] little action your little you're
[1:08:36] limiting yourself notice when you try to
[1:08:38] confine God to to one denomination or to
[1:08:41] one little action he didn't say you're
[1:08:43] confining or you're limiting God but you
[1:08:45] are limiting yourself you see when you
[1:08:48] try to put God into a box or you try to
[1:08:51] say God can't do this you're not
[1:08:53] limiting God because God can't be held
[1:08:55] in a box you're limiting yourself God
[1:08:58] covers all places he's everywhere he
[1:09:01] knows he knows all things he can be
[1:09:03] anywhere anytime he's all-powerful and
[1:09:06] if you get to know how great he is then
[1:09:08] you can know something about his power
[1:09:11] notice if you can get to know how great
[1:09:13] he is then you can know something about
[1:09:16] his power you look at the Universe you
[1:09:18] look at the stars you look at the trees
[1:09:19] you can see who God is I'll say Samson
[1:09:23] was able to know how great God was so he
[1:09:27] was able to know God in his power I'll
[1:09:30] say that when David was out there on the
[1:09:32] backside of that desert he was able to
[1:09:34] know God so he was able to release and
[1:09:36] understand God in his power
[1:09:40] I believe this thing's about to die man
[1:09:42] I think it is anyway but notice it just
[1:09:45] be just be ready
[1:09:46] this thing has limits but God don't you
[1:09:49] see God
[1:09:50] has a no risk
[1:09:54] City restrictions there are certain
[1:09:56] things or boundaries in humanity or even
[1:09:59] in Nations that there are we haven't we
[1:10:02] have no fly zones in America in the
[1:10:04] Atlantic and in The Possession Pacific
[1:10:06] there are no-fly zones that Russia keeps
[1:10:09] bordering up against and flying over our
[1:10:12] no-fly zones but I want you to know to
[1:10:14] God there is no no fly zones God can go
[1:10:18] anywhere you cannot hold him in a jail
[1:10:20] cell God will get out you cannot hold
[1:10:23] him in some Creed God will get out you
[1:10:26] cannot hold him in some idea God will
[1:10:29] get out he is supreme in power he's
[1:10:32] Supreme and authority and a supreme in
[1:10:34] knowledge yes he is ill-eleon the strong
[1:10:38] one the possessor of Heaven and Earth
[1:10:40] and he alone has a rights to make such
[1:10:43] legal decisions and actions towards any
[1:10:46] foe towards any devil towards any sin
[1:10:49] towards any power towards any debt Our
[1:10:53] God has the ability to reach to you
[1:10:59] you will say well you don't understand
[1:11:00] how big a deep of a pit that I'm in you
[1:11:03] don't understand how long my arms my
[1:11:05] father's arms are
[1:11:08] I always I always wrote this kid I call
[1:11:12] his name but he might actually get a
[1:11:13] hold of this but he was always on a
[1:11:15] school bus you ever want to get an
[1:11:17] education you just get on a school bus
[1:11:18] one time don't let your kids ride a
[1:11:20] school bus you'll find everything you
[1:11:21] need to know about life on a school bus
[1:11:23] but I found out on a school bus that
[1:11:26] that was this kid on there that he was
[1:11:29] always talking about how strong his
[1:11:31] daddy was that he could lift up a car
[1:11:33] and he could put it over his shoulders
[1:11:35] we'll come to find out his daddy was a
[1:11:37] mechanic and he had a lift yes he could
[1:11:39] put it over his shoulders
[1:11:42] but you know about kids kids love to
[1:11:45] brag well you say I say you don't know
[1:11:48] nothing about my father my father has
[1:11:51] the ability to lift a 800 pound Abel
[1:11:53] over top of his head but he didn't know
[1:11:56] we had a tractor that was able to lift
[1:11:58] it but then I began to think about it my
[1:12:01] God owns the cattle on a thousand hills
[1:12:03] he had the ability to give Samson the
[1:12:06] power to lift the gates of Gaza and
[1:12:09] carry it over some 20 some miles my God
[1:12:12] it's the strong one he has the most high
[1:12:16] [Applause]
[1:12:19] notice what David when he sang his song
[1:12:22] of Deliverance in Psalms 18 you can also
[1:12:25] read it in second Samuel 22 Psalms 18
[1:12:28] and 13 the Lord also thundered in the
[1:12:31] heavens and the highest gave his voice
[1:12:34] in second Samuel 22 it said the most
[1:12:37] high thundered out his voice
[1:12:40] hailstones and coals of fire yea he sent
[1:12:43] out arrows and Scattered them and he
[1:12:45] sought out Lightnings and discomforted
[1:12:47] him now notice when you go to studying
[1:12:49] out every Monarch or every King when a
[1:12:52] king gets mad or if he if he gets angry
[1:12:54] and he begins to prepare for war he
[1:12:57] sends the whole Community into into a
[1:13:00] state of commotion but here God it gets
[1:13:04] mad at the enemy that has thrown David
[1:13:07] into this situation and look what nature
[1:13:10] did nature begin to shut out and begin
[1:13:14] to show out the effects of The Sovereign
[1:13:17] one's displeasure
[1:13:19] then the channels of the waters were
[1:13:21] seen and the foundation of the world
[1:13:23] were discovered at any rebuke O Lord at
[1:13:26] the blast of the breath of thy nostrils
[1:13:28] he sent from above he took me he drew me
[1:13:31] out on many Waters he delivered me from
[1:13:33] my strong enemy and from them which
[1:13:35] hated me for they were too strong for me
[1:13:38] they prevented me in the day of my
[1:13:40] Calamity my Calamity but the Lord
[1:13:45] but Jehovah was my stay he brought me
[1:13:49] forth also into a large place and he
[1:13:52] delivered me because he delighted in me
[1:13:54] I'll say that El Elion has delighted in
[1:13:58] The Bride of Jesus Christ and he has
[1:14:00] sets you on this message it is your rock
[1:14:03] of Revelation
[1:14:06] foreign
[1:14:08] I want to say that no matter where no
[1:14:11] matter where Satan goes he is on God's
[1:14:15] Property and he's in God's territory
[1:14:19] there ain't a devil safe in God's
[1:14:21] jurisdiction there ain't a power there
[1:14:24] ain't a power that's tried to afflict
[1:14:26] you this week or try to hinder your life
[1:14:28] or upset you
[1:14:30] somebody better turn some air on here
[1:14:32] there's this place going to take Wings
[1:14:34] in here
[1:14:35] I don't know if y'all flying or trying
[1:14:37] to fly higher because y'all got limits
[1:14:39] or it's just a little hard on you but I
[1:14:41] want you to hey God has in the whole
[1:14:44] territory that it can hold him back and
[1:14:46] say he's not welcome here there is there
[1:14:48] is the only thing that can hold God back
[1:14:51] is your attitude of jealousy to keep God
[1:14:54] out of your life
[1:14:55] that's the only thing that'll keep God
[1:14:58] from moving in your life is a denial to
[1:15:00] repent of your sins and deny the truth
[1:15:03] that'll keep God out of your life but if
[1:15:06] you welcome the almighty if you have a
[1:15:08] welcoming Spirit if you have an inviting
[1:15:11] home if you have a place of worship a
[1:15:14] place where God feels welcome there is
[1:15:16] no bounds there is no limits to the
[1:15:19] bedroom there's no limits to the living
[1:15:22] room there's no limits to the kitchen
[1:15:24] almighty God wants to cook a turkey with
[1:15:27] you almighty God wants to wash the
[1:15:29] dishes with you
[1:15:31] he is the most high but it can come to
[1:15:34] the lowest
[1:15:40] you see when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:15:42] and paid for you God hung a no
[1:15:45] trespassing sign over you and said Satan
[1:15:48] you're not welcome here
[1:15:51] and as long as the blood is there Satan
[1:15:54] can't even come close to you he can he
[1:15:57] can sit around the spirits of your home
[1:15:59] he can sit out there he can dance and he
[1:16:02] can try to make you think that you're
[1:16:03] weak you're not big you're not strong
[1:16:06] but the only way that you don't stay
[1:16:10] fortified is if you go out there to the
[1:16:12] devil
[1:16:14] but as for me in my house we'll stay
[1:16:16] right here with our early on
[1:16:20] notice notice what brother Madam told us
[1:16:22] he brother Brandon told us in the
[1:16:24] Sumerian Church age
[1:16:26] he said every single time he said every
[1:16:29] single time that he would begin to that
[1:16:31] he would begin to declare himself
[1:16:33] throughout the seven Church ages he
[1:16:36] began to introduce himself as deity he
[1:16:40] introduced himself to the Church of that
[1:16:42] day by deity himself he said I want you
[1:16:45] to notice that every time that he
[1:16:47] introduces himself to a church age he
[1:16:49] puts forth something of his deity he
[1:16:52] said that's the first thing that he
[1:16:53] tries to make known to the church that's
[1:16:55] the deity or his deity that is God and
[1:16:58] I'll say this God ain't shy on letting
[1:17:00] you know who he is
[1:17:03] God ain't shout letting Joe Biden know
[1:17:05] who's in control of Israel
[1:17:08] is not is not shy on letting the devil
[1:17:11] know who's his children or not
[1:17:13] I'll say that right now whether you feel
[1:17:16] like it or whether you don't feel like
[1:17:18] it Satan knows if you're a son and
[1:17:21] daughter of God
[1:17:22] because of the power that is radiating
[1:17:25] and pulsating from your life when you go
[1:17:28] to prayer when you go to talking to
[1:17:30] almighty God like Hezekiah begin to pray
[1:17:33] Hezekiah was a man that knew how to pray
[1:17:36] he prayed and God sent an angel and it
[1:17:39] destroyed 185
[1:17:42] 000 Assyrians
[1:17:44] I'd say Satan realized real quick there
[1:17:48] was somebody that had an open Channel
[1:17:50] with their early on
[1:17:52] When Death come for Hezekiah he prayed
[1:17:55] one prayer
[1:17:57] he turned his face to the wall and he
[1:18:00] asked for 15 more years
[1:18:02] who was he talking to L Illy on it
[1:18:07] God ain't shy
[1:18:09] on letting you know who he is if he
[1:18:11] would come to every Church age and he
[1:18:13] would address him he would address he
[1:18:16] would address the church as one of his
[1:18:18] deity names that I am he that was which
[1:18:22] is and which shall come I am the first I
[1:18:25] am the last I am the almighty God
[1:18:28] he is not shy on letting anybody know
[1:18:31] who he is
[1:18:34] I wonder do you know this God
[1:18:38] I wonder
[1:18:40] I'd say that many of you thought this
[1:18:42] week while you were sitting around your
[1:18:44] family altar Family Table and you were
[1:18:46] sitting there and you begin to think
[1:18:48] about why wouldn't it be nice to have
[1:18:51] Granddaddy here he's done slip to be on
[1:18:53] the grave or wouldn't it be nice to have
[1:18:55] our grandmother here she's done went on
[1:18:57] beyond the curtain of time
[1:18:59] but I wonder if you thought wouldn't it
[1:19:03] be nice if Jesus would sit at this table
[1:19:12] you see you've got to make some
[1:19:14] decisions in your life decisions in your
[1:19:16] business decisions in your family you've
[1:19:19] got to make him Lord of all
[1:19:23] I'm trying to declare and I'm trying to
[1:19:26] tell you how great my God is but you've
[1:19:29] got to let him he is only as great as
[1:19:31] you confess him great you see if you
[1:19:34] don't confess he's the greatest if you
[1:19:37] don't confess he's the strongest if you
[1:19:39] don't confess he's the almighty your
[1:19:42] witness is as strong as your confession
[1:19:44] but as for me he is my savior he is my
[1:19:49] redeemer he is my way maker he is my
[1:19:52] healer he's my doctor he's my lawyer
[1:19:55] he's my financial advisor he's my real
[1:19:58] estate agent he's my guidance counselor
[1:20:01] he is everything he is ill-eleone
[1:20:10] already
[1:20:14] it's not you it's me
[1:20:18] we put my CIA agent away there for a
[1:20:21] minute
[1:20:25] some of you get it today
[1:20:28] but notice when Abraham
[1:20:30] when Abraham come out of the confusion
[1:20:33] of Babylon
[1:20:35] wanted to do he come out he come out of
[1:20:37] complete confusion
[1:20:39] up there trying to get high as God
[1:20:42] that's one number I was trying to do he
[1:20:44] was trying to build a city that could
[1:20:45] get as high as God and show that his
[1:20:47] kingdom so that he was greater than God
[1:20:49] now notice I want you to think about
[1:20:51] this that that's where Abraham came from
[1:20:54] that Abraham was down the hill in the
[1:20:57] midst of in the midst of the Bible in
[1:20:59] the midst of unknown gods in the midst
[1:21:01] of a confusion language notice God ain't
[1:21:03] the author of confusion but the devil is
[1:21:06] so you recognize who they got to serving
[1:21:09] down there they got to Worship in a
[1:21:11] spirit that would make them think that
[1:21:13] they could get as high as God was but
[1:21:16] notice God never spoke to Abraham while
[1:21:19] he was down there in Mabel it was when
[1:21:21] Abraham separated himself when Abraham
[1:21:24] come out to himself then God began to
[1:21:27] speak to him then he was able to serve
[1:21:29] him he come out of there of his mother
[1:21:31] and his father he come out of there with
[1:21:33] his wife Sarah but notice after the
[1:21:35] confusion came The Voice
[1:21:37] you notice where you were at in the
[1:21:40] midst of your confusion down at a
[1:21:42] Catholic church but God never talked to
[1:21:44] you down there but when you got out of
[1:21:46] it
[1:21:47] when he got out of that Catholic system
[1:21:49] or the Nickelodeon system that was
[1:21:52] trying to conquer your soul and Conquer
[1:21:54] your life
[1:21:55] that God began to speak to you
[1:22:02] you think about this
[1:22:04] in the ministry of William Branham he
[1:22:06] declares to us
[1:22:10] 1196 times he's here
[1:22:14] there ain't one Pope that's going to say
[1:22:16] that he's here
[1:22:17] as he's thinking about himself there
[1:22:19] ain't one Archbishop that can declare
[1:22:21] that he's here but there was a prophet
[1:22:24] that stood in this day and told us he
[1:22:26] told us he referred to the scripture
[1:22:28] Hebrews 13 and 8 over 3 100 times
[1:22:32] declaring that this message was not
[1:22:34] William Branham but this message was
[1:22:38] almighty God
[1:22:40] if he's still the same yesterday and he
[1:22:42] was able to get Abraham out of confusion
[1:22:44] he's able to get your children that are
[1:22:47] stuck in a Sodom and Gomorrah situation
[1:22:49] and there is a voice that pierces
[1:22:52] through the darkness
[1:22:55] there is no power that can hold our
[1:22:58] young boys back or hold our young girls
[1:23:00] back when the almighty God gets going
[1:23:03] after and hunting after his children
[1:23:05] [Applause]
[1:23:07] there ain't no sin there ain't no power
[1:23:09] there ain't no earthly foe that can keep
[1:23:12] them where they are when God does the
[1:23:14] calling after his seed
[1:23:22] Hallelujah
[1:23:25] foreign
[1:23:27] Who come out when Abraham
[1:23:33] this knowledge is too high that I cannot
[1:23:35] attain it's what David said
[1:23:38] to think that who came out to Abraham
[1:23:41] after the battle
[1:23:44] after he fought for his brother after he
[1:23:46] was fighting for his Wayward kin that
[1:23:49] had got out there he got out there and
[1:23:51] kings came in there
[1:23:53] and took his own his own brother his his
[1:23:56] nephew he came in there and took him but
[1:23:58] notice who came out to Abraham after the
[1:24:01] battle was over
[1:24:03] did
[1:24:06] this wasn't some man but this was none
[1:24:10] other than the Incarnate Lord Jesus
[1:24:12] Christ that came out to Abraham after he
[1:24:15] had fought the Battle for the right
[1:24:17] motives
[1:24:21] what did he do he had Fellowship
[1:24:24] with Melchizedek and one of my favorite
[1:24:27] quotes William Randolph said
[1:24:30] he said now you will too
[1:24:36] now think about this
[1:24:38] you've been through every battle
[1:24:41] and it seems like it's been an uphill
[1:24:42] battle but now you will have fellowship
[1:24:45] with Melchizedek too
[1:24:49] and brother bear I'm a good brother I'm
[1:24:51] going to went home to say he went on to
[1:24:52] say he said now he said that's people
[1:24:54] that sit here and say well I don't
[1:24:55] believe in shouting and I don't believe
[1:24:57] in speaking in tongues and I don't
[1:24:59] believe in Divine Healing he said it
[1:25:01] shows that you never had the victory yet
[1:25:03] he said but if you ever get a taste of
[1:25:05] the victory one time you'll believe in
[1:25:07] Divine Healing you'll believe in
[1:25:09] shouting you'll believe in emotions he
[1:25:12] said if you once get a taste of the
[1:25:13] victory then you'll believe in it oh I
[1:25:16] believe that there's somebody in the
[1:25:19] house of God that knows what it's like
[1:25:21] to sit down and have fellowship with
[1:25:24] Melchizedek to taste of the victory of
[1:25:26] the battles to bring back a loved one to
[1:25:29] bring back to bring back and the
[1:25:32] fellowship where they're early on their
[1:25:34] possessor of Heaven and Earth
[1:25:37] let me say this to you when early on
[1:25:39] blesses you it doesn't matter what any
[1:25:41] Earthly King does
[1:25:43] the king of Sodom said look he said I
[1:25:45] want you to take all the spoils of this
[1:25:47] battle he said oh no he said I'm not
[1:25:50] taking one shoe latch it and I'm not
[1:25:51] taking one string he said unless you
[1:25:54] because you'll say that I got rich
[1:25:56] because of you he said but I have lifted
[1:25:59] up my hands to the possessor of Heaven
[1:26:02] and Earth let me ask you some Church of
[1:26:04] the Living God when almighty God blesses
[1:26:07] you what else do you need when he
[1:26:09] blesses you with healing what else do
[1:26:11] you need when he blesses you with Fancy
[1:26:14] with fine things and with a nice home
[1:26:16] what else do you need when ill illian
[1:26:19] says I am your lord I am your strength I
[1:26:22] am your exceeding great reward
[1:26:26] there we go
[1:26:29] what else do you need tonight young boy
[1:26:31] what else do you need tonight when he
[1:26:33] says I'm going to give you the very
[1:26:35] dynamics of the Holy Spirit you've
[1:26:37] danced around the mechanics all of your
[1:26:39] life but what else do you need when
[1:26:41] almighty God pours out his Dynamics on
[1:26:43] your life and gives you the same spirit
[1:26:45] that was on the inside of him you don't
[1:26:48] need no other power you don't need no
[1:26:50] other teaching you don't need no other
[1:26:52] intellect when almighty God pours his
[1:26:54] life on the inside of you you have been
[1:26:56] blessed by the almighty God
[1:27:03] foreign
[1:27:05] let me tell you you're sitting here
[1:27:07] tonight and you got breath in your lungs
[1:27:09] you've been blessed by almighty God if
[1:27:11] you can lift up your hands you've been
[1:27:13] blessed by almighty God if you can shout
[1:27:16] hallelujah you've been blessed by
[1:27:18] almighty God I don't think there's
[1:27:20] anybody that should sit here quiet today
[1:27:22] because you've got breath in your lungs
[1:27:25] you've got to praise in your lips you've
[1:27:27] got a God in your soul
[1:27:29] and there's a Rapture in your future and
[1:27:32] there ain't no devil in hell that'll
[1:27:34] stop you from making it
[1:27:36] what are you afraid about aliens on your
[1:27:39] side Samson tear down every Philistine
[1:27:42] David kill every Giant
[1:27:50] change them batters out and give me that
[1:27:52] microphone
[1:27:54] when the alliance on your side he's the
[1:27:56] biggest business partner that you can
[1:27:58] ever buy into when ileon's on your side
[1:28:01] you ain't got to worry about cancer he's
[1:28:04] stronger he's higher than cancer
[1:28:09] [Applause]
[1:28:17] laughs thought it was high
[1:28:20] in the 1700s they told us
[1:28:25] that if a man ever went beyond the the
[1:28:27] miles per hour of 30 miles per hour that
[1:28:29] they would fly off the Earth
[1:28:33] thank God we ain't going by that logic
[1:28:35] anymore
[1:28:39] what's wrong with your people you're
[1:28:41] just flying loose you're going over 30
[1:28:42] miles an hour
[1:28:45] you're not even aware of it but you are
[1:28:48] sitting here and going 660
[1:28:52] 000 miles per hour right now and you're
[1:28:55] not even aware of it
[1:28:59] so it depends on who's looking how fast
[1:29:02] you're going
[1:29:04] you recognize that when NASA flies off
[1:29:07] the Earth that you're leaving they're
[1:29:09] leaving here at a velocity of 36 000
[1:29:12] miles I'd say that they shut up the
[1:29:15] ideology of the 1700s because man was
[1:29:18] evolving in their knowledge and you
[1:29:21] notice brother random told us he said
[1:29:22] there is a spiritual Evolution he said
[1:29:25] God created botany life then he created
[1:29:27] animal life and then he got as high as
[1:29:29] he would in creation when he created
[1:29:31] Humanity he but he went on to say he
[1:29:34] said there is a spiritual Evolution he
[1:29:37] said it goes from justification under
[1:29:39] Luther and sanctification under Wesley
[1:29:41] and so on it is an evolution of almighty
[1:29:45] God that is taking and building his body
[1:29:48] by his spirit and now today there is a
[1:29:52] body on Earth that has evolved by the
[1:29:55] spirit that is the stature of a perfect
[1:29:57] man
[1:29:59] they know who they are they know what he
[1:30:01] wants done with the word there is now a
[1:30:04] body in connection with supreme
[1:30:06] authority that is trained to break into
[1:30:10] the realm of the most high God now
[1:30:13] William Branham was a forerunner and he
[1:30:15] showed us how to do it
[1:30:18] you remember when brother made him
[1:30:19] standing there for a little sick girl
[1:30:21] I believe he's a little sick girl maybe
[1:30:23] a little boy was standing there and he
[1:30:25] said he said I by my faith
[1:30:27] can move that little move that little
[1:30:30] triangle I can move that little piece
[1:30:32] right there that little bracelet
[1:30:34] I said well no man can do that he said
[1:30:37] but I can do that
[1:30:40] and they quick only here when he had
[1:30:42] everybody turned her back to him he
[1:30:44] began to move that thing he'd roll
[1:30:46] around in a circle he'd roll it back the
[1:30:48] other way she said well that's
[1:30:50] witchcraft he said oh no that's my faith
[1:30:53] he said if I had enough Faith about
[1:30:55] myself he said if I needed that little
[1:30:57] old Barlow knife that I got out there on
[1:30:58] my dresser he said I could reach down in
[1:31:00] my pocket and it would be there if I
[1:31:02] really hadn't eat of it William Branham
[1:31:04] was a forward Runner that showed us how
[1:31:06] these things were to be done in the
[1:31:09] third pool he stood there he was in need
[1:31:11] of squirrels I don't believe there's
[1:31:13] anybody sitting here right now that
[1:31:14] needs a squirrel but there is somebody
[1:31:16] that needs deliverance from cancer there
[1:31:18] is somebody that has need of unbelief
[1:31:20] deliverance from unbelief there is
[1:31:22] somebody that needs an understanding of
[1:31:24] godhead and there is somebody a Supreme
[1:31:28] Being that is in this room right now
[1:31:32] that has the ability to open up every
[1:31:35] channel and he's able to push back
[1:31:37] cancer and open up the godhead and give
[1:31:39] a revelation and brother Bynum said
[1:31:41] there is no devil in hell that can stop
[1:31:44] the Revelation when God wants to give it
[1:31:46] I'll say God's one to give it to you
[1:31:49] more than you could ever have need of it
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:57] God's got a people that know how to tap
[1:31:59] into a channel
[1:32:01] they don't believe he's just a God that
[1:32:04] used to but they believe that he is able
[1:32:06] right now to do what he did back then
[1:32:08] had he Waldorf that had cancer in her
[1:32:12] heart and cancer throughout her body
[1:32:13] told her husband said if I die in this
[1:32:16] prayer line you take me through that
[1:32:18] prayer line she died in that prayer line
[1:32:20] they asked brother random to come over
[1:32:22] the hair brother Branham laid his hands
[1:32:24] on Hattie Waldorf went back to preaching
[1:32:27] Hattie Waldorf got up off of that
[1:32:29] stretcher and went around testifying of
[1:32:32] the power of almighty God if he could do
[1:32:35] it for a Hattie a Waldorf
[1:32:37] she was in a worse condition than
[1:32:40] anybody that's sitting here right now if
[1:32:42] he could do it for Hattie Waldorf what
[1:32:44] about you that's got cancer written
[1:32:46] cases cancer of your mind
[1:32:52] that's something a whole lot worse the
[1:32:54] cancer of the flesh it's a cancer of the
[1:32:56] soul that keeps eating
[1:32:59] he'll put jealousy in you he'll put
[1:33:01] pride in you he'll put Strife on the
[1:33:03] inside of you and what is it it's a
[1:33:06] devil that's jealous of the power of the
[1:33:08] ministry that's jealous of the music
[1:33:10] that's jealous of somebody beside you
[1:33:13] and you got cancer in your soul
[1:33:15] foreign
[1:33:17] I think I'd rather have cancer of the
[1:33:18] flesh than have cancer of the Soul
[1:33:20] to think that I could get so high and
[1:33:23] get so jealous of somebody else that I
[1:33:26] couldn't receive them getting a blessing
[1:33:28] because I didn't get it it's amazing how
[1:33:31] many people get so upset when somebody
[1:33:33] else speaks in tongues or somebody else
[1:33:36] interprets or somebody else shouts and
[1:33:38] they didn't Shout
[1:33:42] I ought to give you the spirit of
[1:33:43] blessings and gratefulness to show you
[1:33:46] that God is back in the body again
[1:33:49] this is a restoration of the days of
[1:33:53] Pentecost again
[1:33:59] but if God really cared about me
[1:34:01] he would give me that blessing do you
[1:34:04] recognize if you've got the gift of love
[1:34:08] every gift is below you
[1:34:12] I think it's amazing I don't know why
[1:34:14] I'm here but I'm here this is completely
[1:34:16] off my subject but I think it's amazing
[1:34:18] that somebody gets so upset about
[1:34:21] somebody speaking in tongues and they
[1:34:23] didn't get to
[1:34:24] and it is the lowest of the gifts in the
[1:34:27] body
[1:34:29] I welcome the lowest gift and I welcome
[1:34:31] the highest gift but the main thing that
[1:34:34] I want for everyone here is The Giver of
[1:34:38] the gifts
[1:34:45] oh yeah go ahead and clap your hands I
[1:34:48] just patted the devil right on out of
[1:34:50] here
[1:34:54] that's right he's got no business in
[1:34:57] your mind he's got no business in your
[1:35:00] soul he's got no business in your spirit
[1:35:02] so Satan get out of the house of God we
[1:35:06] are a church that's born by the very
[1:35:08] Breath of God you didn't Inspire us
[1:35:10] we're inspired by almighty God Satan
[1:35:13] take your leave thank you
[1:35:15] this is Almighty God's house this ain't
[1:35:18] man's house this is God's house this
[1:35:21] ain't man's doing this is God's doing
[1:35:26] God won't let your jealousy stand in his
[1:35:28] way
[1:35:32] we've been trained to break into a realm
[1:35:34] of the most high God if John Ryan could
[1:35:36] tap into it and it could run down
[1:35:38] through their screaming I'm seeing I'm
[1:35:41] seeing if he could do it and Georgie
[1:35:44] Carter could do it lay in nine years 47
[1:35:47] pounds had a disease that her uncle
[1:35:50] raped her with and now she's dealing
[1:35:52] with TB
[1:35:55] I'd say if the most high God can go to
[1:35:57] Georgie Carter the most high God can go
[1:35:59] to the batons the most high God can go
[1:36:01] to the freezers
[1:36:04] [Applause]
[1:36:13] the most high God
[1:36:16] can get the congressman upshot
[1:36:22] he can get to you
[1:36:27] foreign
[1:36:30] there might be some times in your life
[1:36:32] when it seems like the voice of God is
[1:36:34] silent
[1:36:36] and it seems like the promise is getting
[1:36:38] heavy on you
[1:36:40] but if Melchizedek can come to you once
[1:36:43] Melchizedek can come to you twice
[1:36:47] if Melchizedek as a priest
[1:36:51] every time you walk by a preacher or a
[1:36:53] priest
[1:36:54] throughout the scriptures a priest has
[1:36:57] the ability to lay a blessing on you
[1:37:01] who laid this blessing on Abraham but
[1:37:05] the most high God
[1:37:09] let me say this
[1:37:12] let me say this if God's got something
[1:37:14] in your future
[1:37:16] the most high has already so high he's
[1:37:19] so tall he's so big and it may look like
[1:37:22] it's a hundred miles away from you
[1:37:24] almighty God sees where it's at
[1:37:31] Sister Sarah Robinsons is coming
[1:37:33] tomorrow I hope she's saying this but
[1:37:34] she sings this song There's a promise
[1:37:36] coming down that Dusty Road
[1:37:38] foreign
[1:37:39] I'd say I'd say the blind Bartimaeus in
[1:37:43] his condition didn't recognize that
[1:37:45] today was his last day sitting where he
[1:37:47] was sitting it out I'd say that Abraham
[1:37:49] awaiting for the promises didn't
[1:37:52] recognize that this was the last day
[1:37:54] that I live or look like a hundred year
[1:37:57] old man but today melchizedek's coming
[1:38:00] to my household I'm going to feed him
[1:38:02] communion I'm going to fellowship with
[1:38:05] him and he's going to change my body if
[1:38:07] Melchizedek came to your once Abraham
[1:38:10] Melchizedek can come to you twice
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:16] notice the promise wasn't just Abraham
[1:38:19] but it was just his seed after him you
[1:38:21] can go throughout all the Bible and you
[1:38:23] can find that the promise was to Abraham
[1:38:25] and his seed after him and the Bible
[1:38:28] said in Galatians 3 and 29 that if you
[1:38:31] are Christ then are your Abraham's seed
[1:38:33] and heirs according to the promise let
[1:38:35] me tell you blessings can only come from
[1:38:38] somebody higher and if you are Abraham's
[1:38:41] seed you inherit all the blessings that
[1:38:43] were promised to Abraham
[1:38:45] somebody give somebody a high five give
[1:38:48] them a give God a high a high five
[1:38:51] himself give God some praise in here you
[1:38:54] are inheriting the blessings of almighty
[1:38:58] God if Abraham was promised to change
[1:39:00] you are promised to change
[1:39:06] there's something different when
[1:39:07] Melchizedek comes by your way
[1:39:09] the atmosphere changes I'll say this the
[1:39:13] kind of atmosphere brother Dre that is
[1:39:15] in this building right now will be the
[1:39:17] atmosphere that'll change our bodies
[1:39:19] between the morning of the hours of six
[1:39:22] and nine this whole body will be changed
[1:39:25] in a twinkling of an eye the atmosphere
[1:39:27] of Melchizedek is in the body
[1:39:30] [Applause]
[1:39:39] the Bible says in Psalms 7 and 17 that I
[1:39:43] will praise the Lord according to his
[1:39:45] righteousness and will sing praise to
[1:39:47] the name of the Lord most high
[1:39:50] Psalms 97 and 9 for thou Lord are high
[1:39:54] above all the Earth Thou Art exalted for
[1:39:56] him of all God
[1:39:59] you can name every God that there is you
[1:40:02] can name Muhammad and our God is exalted
[1:40:05] above him
[1:40:07] Muhammad Buddha Confucius Michael Jordan
[1:40:10] Michael Jackson LeBron James our God is
[1:40:15] exalted above every God he's bigger than
[1:40:17] Tom Brady he's bigger than Peyton
[1:40:19] Manning he's bigger than Donald Trump
[1:40:21] he's bigger than Joe Biden he's bigger
[1:40:23] than Putin he's bigger than Newton John
[1:40:25] who our God is exalted of every God
[1:40:28] above every God above the god of cancer
[1:40:30] a God above the god of anxiety above the
[1:40:33] god of depression our God is exalted
[1:40:36] above every god of Egypt above every god
[1:40:39] of depression Our God's bigger than
[1:40:41] oppression I'm God's bigger than covet
[1:40:43] I'm God's bigger than the flu Our God's
[1:40:46] bigger than back pain my God is exalted
[1:40:49] about every God and Philippians chapter
[1:40:51] 2 and 9 tells us that God has given him
[1:40:54] a name that every knee is going to have
[1:40:56] to bow and every tongue is going to have
[1:40:58] to confess his name is so high it's
[1:41:01] lifted above every name
[1:41:04] foreign
[1:41:08] he is Jehovah Shalom he is our peace he
[1:41:11] is Jehovah he is all of these seven
[1:41:14] compounds name but none of them have the
[1:41:16] power to save you
[1:41:20] he would declare himself as the most
[1:41:22] high he would declare himself as hell
[1:41:24] Shady are the great one the breasted one
[1:41:26] as the strength Giver that Abraham what
[1:41:30] did Abraham need
[1:41:32] he needed a new body
[1:41:37] and almighty God
[1:41:39] was El Sharia to Abraham
[1:41:42] and he leaned on the bosom of el Shady
[1:41:45] eye and he drawed out the very power to
[1:41:49] create Isaac
[1:41:53] what is he
[1:41:54] Abraham didn't have the strength
[1:41:59] you adults know what I'm saying he
[1:42:01] didn't have the strength
[1:42:03] Sarah didn't have the power
[1:42:05] the milk veins have dried up the ability
[1:42:08] to Bear a child have escaped her but who
[1:42:11] did they lean on they leaned on El
[1:42:14] shadiah and when you are leaning on El
[1:42:16] Shady eye he is stronger than every
[1:42:19] strong thing in your life it seems like
[1:42:22] death has got a hold of Abraham but
[1:42:24] Abraham just leans over on the bosom of
[1:42:27] el Sharia and he pulls out strength he
[1:42:31] pulls out a blessing he pulls out the
[1:42:33] ability to bring life again
[1:42:36] and in your dead situation you could not
[1:42:40] bring forth life but you leaned over
[1:42:44] you didn't have the ability to save
[1:42:46] yourself Jehovah shama has no saving
[1:42:48] power in it Jehovah Shalom has no saving
[1:42:51] power in it but when he came to Mary and
[1:42:54] he told her that you shall call his name
[1:42:57] Jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:43:02] their sins
[1:43:03] he is Jehovah savior he is none other
[1:43:09] than Jesus Christ
[1:43:15] Psalms 57 and 2 that I will cry unto the
[1:43:19] god most high unto God that performeth
[1:43:22] all things for me he shall send from
[1:43:24] heaven and save me from the reproach of
[1:43:26] him that would swallow me up Salah God
[1:43:29] shall send forth his mercy and his truth
[1:43:32] Zephaniah 3 and 17 the Lord my God in
[1:43:36] the midst of thee is mighty say mighty
[1:43:39] he will save he will rejoice over thee
[1:43:42] with joy he will rest in his love he
[1:43:45] will Joy over thee with singing
[1:43:48] foreign
[1:43:49] put it on your refrigerator put it on
[1:43:51] your iPhone put it on your Android
[1:43:53] Zephaniah 3 and 17 the Lord thy God is
[1:43:58] in the midst of thee is mighty he is
[1:44:02] all-powerful he will save
[1:44:06] I'm in too big of a mess brother Andrew
[1:44:07] but he will save and not only will he
[1:44:11] save he will rejoice over you I think
[1:44:14] it's amazing when we get excited because
[1:44:16] God saved us but when God Saves you the
[1:44:20] Bible has declared that he gets happy
[1:44:22] and he gets to rejoice in because of his
[1:44:25] saving power
[1:44:29] no
[1:44:33] fear not Abraham
[1:44:35] I am thy Shield
[1:44:38] and I am your exceeding great reward
[1:44:42] if God is your sealed
[1:44:44] how is the devil ever going to hit you
[1:44:49] that's your prophet's voice
[1:44:55] if God is your Shield
[1:44:57] how's it ever ever going to hit you
[1:45:01] foreign
[1:45:03] Devil's got a bow to the name of Jesus
[1:45:08] I'm going to labor some points right
[1:45:09] here Muhammad has to bow to the name of
[1:45:12] Jesus
[1:45:14] Buddha has to bow to the name of Jesus
[1:45:18] you look throughout the Old Testament
[1:45:19] and you see the god of Baal Baal has to
[1:45:22] Bow before the name of Jesus
[1:45:26] are you with me every anxiety has to bow
[1:45:30] to the name of Jesus because Jesus is
[1:45:35] the only God
[1:45:41] menopause has to bow to the name of
[1:45:45] Jesus
[1:45:46] varicose veins have to bow to the name
[1:45:50] of Jesus high blood pressure has to bow

[1:50:37] that there is nowhere that you can hide
[1:50:43] I am taking every excuse
[1:50:45] away from the devil tonight
[1:50:48] if he could go to a finished border and
[1:50:51] there was Russians standing on one side
[1:50:53] and finished sitting on the other side
[1:50:55] yet it didn't stop the power of almighty
[1:50:58] God even though there may have been
[1:50:59] Strife between one another it did not
[1:51:02] stop the power of almighty God from
[1:51:04] getting this little boy that was dead
[1:51:06] and been laying there that had been hit
[1:51:08] by a car and they spent his bones and
[1:51:10] his legs were sticking out of his pant
[1:51:12] legs
[1:51:14] they never did call William Bradham a
[1:51:16] false prophet because that boy was up on
[1:51:18] his feet within five minutes time
[1:51:24] I want to say to you that the same God
[1:51:26] is in this room
[1:51:28] and there's no way that you're going to
[1:51:30] miss a Rapture because you're a gene of
[1:51:33] God

[1:51:36] will not go down as a liar and somebody
[1:51:39] that just makes up words God will get
[1:51:42] you where he needs you to be at
[1:51:49] anymore
[1:51:54] the devil's know there's one God
[1:51:57] even they tremble
[1:52:08] that little anyway
[1:52:10] horny woman
[1:52:12] had been standing out there
[1:52:14] all night long the do had done set in on
[1:52:18] her shoulders
[1:52:19] she didn't know one thing about William
[1:52:21] Branham all she needed was the god of
[1:52:24] Elijah
[1:52:32] throughout the years of being in the
[1:52:34] message there's been Believers that ran
[1:52:36] into people that were in the prayer line
[1:52:38] they didn't know one thing about William
[1:52:40] Branham but they met the god of William
[1:52:42] Branham
[1:52:44] T.L Osborne stood at William branham's
[1:52:47] at William branham's funeral and said we
[1:52:50] seen God in this man
[1:52:54] I'll say that there if we if time
[1:52:56] tarries that there will be people that
[1:52:59] come to your funeral and say that I sing
[1:53:01] God in this man
[1:53:04] I sing God in that woman what is
[1:53:08] Christianity it's tabernacling deity all
[1:53:11] over God all over again
[1:53:16] Satan knows
[1:53:18] that he can never reach as high as God
[1:53:19] can
[1:53:22] he can hold you with two thousand demons
[1:53:25] but they ain't powerful enough
[1:53:30] you can be housed in a cage of hell and
[1:53:33] it ain't strong enough to keep God from
[1:53:35] getting you out
[1:53:36] Legion had been a good person
[1:53:41] but he got out playing a card game
[1:53:45] and running around on his wife
[1:53:49] and it led him to be Unbound and
[1:53:52] possessed with over 2 000 devils
[1:53:55] and you think that you can control it
[1:54:00] I can handle I can handle the gaming
[1:54:05] I can handle the apps I can handle I can
[1:54:08] handle these little games that just I
[1:54:10] just need a little bit of break in my in
[1:54:11] my break time while I'm at work so I'm
[1:54:14] just taking I'm taking a little break
[1:54:15] I'm playing a little game
[1:54:17] Satan's creeping its way into your soul
[1:54:20] I ain't against James I enjoy playing
[1:54:22] games but you better be careful with
[1:54:24] your time
[1:54:27] if you'd rather play a game than read
[1:54:29] your Bible it shows that somebody's
[1:54:31] sitting on the throne room of your heart
[1:54:32] that ain't God
[1:54:36] foreign
[1:54:40] just one time is all you need
[1:54:43] you're going to listen to entice in
[1:54:44] spiritual people brother random said all
[1:54:46] satan is wanting to do is get you to
[1:54:48] smoke one cigarette
[1:54:50] and then he's got you he's wanting you
[1:54:52] to hear one rock and roll song and he's
[1:54:55] got you
[1:54:58] it's the little foxes
[1:55:00] that destroy the vine
[1:55:02] but Legion
[1:55:04] had been bound up
[1:55:07] he wanted to go back to his family
[1:55:10] he wanted to go back to good living
[1:55:12] again
[1:55:13] he wanted to go back to what it was to
[1:55:15] be a real good moral person again but
[1:55:17] every single time
[1:55:19] that he would let his mind go back to
[1:55:21] what things were
[1:55:22] the devil began to beat him and thrash
[1:55:25] him over and over and over again
[1:55:28] keep him where he was
[1:55:32] because Satan knows who's coming
[1:55:37] you
[1:55:39] were supposed to have a Thanksgiving
[1:55:40] week
[1:55:44] and Hell broke out
[1:55:48] because Satan knew
[1:55:51] that God was on your road
[1:55:55] he'll cause a storm to come up out of
[1:55:57] the middle of nowhere
[1:56:01] and he thought man we was with Jesus and
[1:56:04] we was having the time of our life and
[1:56:06] all of a sudden I category five
[1:56:09] hurricane showed up after man but I
[1:56:12] flipped my world upside down
[1:56:15] what's going on
[1:56:17] Satan's trying to stop Legion
[1:56:21] from being who he really was in the
[1:56:24] beginning
[1:56:27] man we have the time of our life
[1:56:30] and all hell breaks out
[1:56:31] because hell knows that heaven's coming
[1:56:36] I think it's amazing
[1:56:38] that thanksgiving's supposed to be a
[1:56:40] family time
[1:56:42] but Satan comes in the the most sacred
[1:56:45] of times
[1:56:46] and gets the most disruptive and one of
[1:56:49] the most sacred things the family
[1:56:54] I don't have to
[1:56:55] I don't have to have the gift of
[1:56:57] knowledge or the gift of discernment to
[1:56:58] recognize that you sat down at a table
[1:57:00] I'd say that there was somebody here
[1:57:03] this week that sat down at a table and
[1:57:06] you looked across the table and there
[1:57:08] was somebody that you didn't agree with
[1:57:13] there was somebody at the table that had
[1:57:16] a different political view than you had
[1:57:20] but I think it's amazing that Satan
[1:57:23] wants to take the thing that is so
[1:57:24] sacred
[1:57:27] the closest ties that you have on Earth
[1:57:30] and Destroy and disrupt all of those
[1:57:32] things
[1:57:36] and what did he strip from this Legion
[1:57:39] I want to destroy from Legion
[1:57:42] he stripped his home
[1:57:43] he stripped his God
[1:57:45] he stripped the real Pride that was on
[1:57:48] the inside of him that was to be a real
[1:57:50] human
[1:57:52] Satan ain't just wanting to destroy your
[1:57:57] flesh he's wanting to kill your soul
[1:57:59] he's wanting to kill your sound mind
[1:58:05] but Legion
[1:58:07] wanted this Jesus so bad
[1:58:12] I believe it's in perfect strength
[1:58:14] perfect weakness brother Brandon said
[1:58:16] the devil never would have went out
[1:58:17] there
[1:58:18] unless Legion pushed his way out there
[1:58:25] foreign notice the Devils on the inside
[1:58:29] of Legion recognize that that was El
[1:58:32] helion
[1:58:33] that was preaching to him
[1:58:35] he said thou Son of God the most high
[1:58:38] what do we have to do with you
[1:58:44] every devil is subject to the name of
[1:58:47] Jesus Christ
[1:58:51] I'm getting ready to close
[1:58:54] like I got one more thing I want to
[1:58:56] drive to you
[1:58:58] remember when brother Brandon was was
[1:59:00] there in Africa
[1:59:02] and he was he was watching I believe it
[1:59:04] was Africa and he was watching this he
[1:59:06] was watching this guy
[1:59:07] he was carrying around this Idol and he
[1:59:09] was packing his Idol
[1:59:12] and he was supposed to be a Christian
[1:59:13] but he was packing his Idol
[1:59:15] right that's something
[1:59:20] I won't go there
[1:59:23] but here he is he's supposed to be a
[1:59:24] Christian and he's packing this Idol
[1:59:28] and he said what are you packing that
[1:59:30] artiform it's you Christian he said yeah
[1:59:32] he said this is just in case that God
[1:59:34] fails me
[1:59:38] I think it's amazing that our God
[1:59:40] carries us we ain't got to carry him
[1:59:44] and here he is and he begins to tell the
[1:59:45] story and you know what if you go just
[1:59:46] type in the word of
[1:59:48] database you begin to
[1:59:49] that he said amoyah he said amoyah he
[1:59:52] said this he said this Idol save my
[1:59:54] saved my father one time when a lion
[1:59:56] came out there he said he was getting
[1:59:57] ready he was getting ready to attack my
[1:59:59] father he said to my father built a fire
[2:00:01] and that fire and the fire and he began
[2:00:03] to worship this this Idol right here and
[2:00:06] he said in the idol scared away the lion
[2:00:07] brother said it wasn't that Idol he said
[2:00:09] it was the fire he said a lion's not
[2:00:11] scared of that Idol he said the lion was
[2:00:13] scared of that fire and brother Brandon
[2:00:16] was standing there and he was watching
[2:00:17] these he was watching these these Idol
[2:00:19] packing so-called Christians come to
[2:00:21] this meeting and he was standing there
[2:00:23] and there was a blind man that was
[2:00:25] standing up there that had been a
[2:00:27] worshiper of the Sun for all of those
[2:00:29] years and he's standing up there and
[2:00:31] he's watching these things he's watching
[2:00:32] all this happen and it begins to make a
[2:00:34] declaration he said if one of your Gods
[2:00:37] can heal him let him come forth right
[2:00:40] now he said if not throw down your Idols
[2:00:43] throw down your idols and come and
[2:00:45] worship the Living God and brother
[2:00:48] Brandon said it was the greatest Lush
[2:00:50] Cloud that he ever seen when they threw
[2:00:53] down 30 raw heathens thirty thousand raw
[2:00:56] heathens food down their idols and
[2:00:58] created such a dust cloud
[2:01:01] every devil every demon every Idol has
[2:01:05] to bow to the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:08] and there is no other name that we need
[2:01:11] to worship but the name of Jesus Christ
[2:01:13] there is no other door to heaven but the
[2:01:16] name of Jesus Christ and as for me and
[2:01:20] this church we choose to worship the
[2:01:23] name of Jesus Christ we choose to pray
[2:01:25] in his name Worship in his name dance in
[2:01:29] his name get emotional in his name
