the broken blood cell of Jesus Christ recognizing father that right here Lord right now Lord standing before us is the greatest that is the greatest people on Earth to realize that they are the purchase of what Calvary stood for standing here father is the purchasing power of it father to see what you have done Lord it shows us what you value in life when you redeem Sons and Daughters of God from the dust of the earth that were condemned by the fall but according to Thy word father you predestined us Lord not to stay in a condemned state but to be completely restored by the word of God father we stand here under the shadows of the most high and we ask Lord that thou would us come tonight and you just extend out thy wings of mercy upon our life that you would just touch us Lord we've we've went through another week father we've come back to the house of God our faith Lord sometimes it gets to where we think it's it's at its limits father and then you just begin to give us a another push in the Supernatural and I pray father that you would allow us Lord Lord to inforce the claims Lord as Sons and Daughters of God by a restored word to tell the enemy he has no rights on our property he has no rights in our bodies and father I pray that you would be as good as your word tonight that you would come and vindicate your word you would manifest yourself father you see every one of us here every prayer request every unspoken need even things that we're suffering in our own bodies that maybe others may not know Lord you're the kind of God that you can take the word and be a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and answer all the questions of our body and our soul and our mind Lord we turn this service over to you father father we we commit it to you father and we realize Lord that we are not just we're not just here alone we realize that angels have gathered to watch us worship father but Lord more than angels that are in this place the very one that spoke Let There Be is right here and Lord we just want to set aside a place for you to come and inhabit our heart Lord tonight in the name of the Lord we ask your blessings on this service upon your people and upon those that would car archive this sermon I pray that you would bless them abundantly now father we turn over this service to you for the glory of God in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over in the book of Galatians the book of Galatians chap 3 verse 24 how many love the word of God amen amen that's what we're here for this evening Galatians chapter 3 and verse 24 and the Bible says here wherefore the law was our school master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith has come we are no longer under a school Master for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus I'd like to just re-emphasize that scripture verse 26 for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ neither there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for you for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and hirs according to the promise may God bless his word you may be seated tonight in the presence of the Lord and by the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you again on this on this thought that we were that we were speaking on last weekend on it's matching it's matching time and we realize that that what we have received is a message from another world it's a message from the very it's a message from glory and we realize that that we just kind of turn our minds just for a minute that we we realize that when brother brandham is there in the latter part of his ministry that brother brandham is he's caught up and he he goes he goes beyond the curtain of time and there you just you just remember that brother brandham is there before the multitudes and brother brandom asked the question are all these brandom and he said no these are your converts the voice that was speaking to him said no these are your converts and and and the the one that was speaking to him told him said now you were you were born a leader on Earth and you will be you will be judged by what you preach you will be responsible for what you preached and brother brandham asked this question he said now he said now will Paul be judged by what he preached and the and the voice spoke back said yes Paul will be responsible for what he preached and William brandham said he said then I he said I have preached what Paul preached and a voice came out of the multitudes and said we're resting we're resting on that and we realize that that what this message has done it has turned our hearts back to the same faith of Paul we literally I have watched a restoration how that the word of God has matched this message has matched the faith of the forefathers of of of Paul and Peter and and those that had that had labored in the in the faith there that we realize that we are not just contending for a faith but we are contending for the faith and we realize that that we are a restored people with restored hearts and we realize that the god that we're serving is an unchanging God in all of his ways he is an unchanging God in all of his Dynamics he is an unchanging God so that what he said in the beginning if he said it there he always has to remain the same and has to keep the same pattern every single time we realize that Eve that Eve turned down the word of God and she she turned down the word of God and because of that one because of that one misconstrued word that it brought about the fall but we realize that that God did not change but it was Eve that changed changed the pattern or matched she matched what the serpent was speaking and preaching to her but she did not fully align herself with what the word of God said now brother random said in the Ephesian Church age he said what the church was at Pentecost is the standard he said that is the pattern he said there is no other pattern he said no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages closes and if we're going to do anything as a Church of the Living God we want to pattern oursel according to what a message that we realize that the multitudes that have gone before and the multitudes that are here now we are resting fully Upon A restored word and we want to preach according to what Paul preached we want to live according to the message that William brandham brought us we realize if we're going to do anything in this life we want to match our testimony we want to match our life we want to match our action according to the word of God now brother Brandon was up in New York one time and he was he was going about the city and he you know how how a southern is in the New York City and he said he said there I was he said I was trying to be helpful and he said I was trying to be helpful and he said I watch this woman she she had fell down and everybody just walked past her brother random said that poor woman he said I helped her get back up to her feet and he said nobody picked her up he said but I helped her up and helped her get her groceries back up underneath of her and he said that woman just looked at me real strange and and it really bothered him that that that nobody would help her and how everybody how he would speak to people and nobody would talk back to him and brother bandam was riding in a cab and he begins to tell the driver about this and the cab driver said he said mister he said when anybody comes to New York and he said they act and and acts like they're in their right mind he said we know he's a stranger said them he said them are good people said but they're just getting into that swing he said you take a man that comes here it isn't long until he's in that same condition he comes in here he say tries to do everything said you could lay there down the street in a heart attack somebody would think that you was drunk they'd never touch you let you lay there and die that that he said he said they don't mean to be that way he said it's just getting in the swing of things he said that's the way we do brethren in our church life we get into a swing of one certain Creed or one certain thing and this and there we stay see we swing with the rest of them we swing with our organization we swing with our community it's just natural he said you paint your steps red he said you watch your neighbor does he said they'll do that too oh he said one of our sister gets a certain kind of dress or a hat and watch what your neighbors does he said it's an impersonation it's a matching time he said we don't care whether our trousers match our coats we want our experience to match the word of God you see they were just in the swing of things and I I I want to may may maybe just make this statement the world is swinging this way and the world is swinging that way but I just can't get in the swing of the things that the world is doing that way but I I will say it like this that that I will say this oh swing down one of these days oh chariots and let me step on and let me ride that's the only kind of swing that we want to put oursel in we want to match oursel according to the word of God you see that we realize that that is how the prodical son got himself in trouble that he wanted to pattern himself after the crowds of the world but we don't want to pattern oursel according to the crowds of the world but we want to pattern ourself by the anointed one and we have received an anointed message an anointed word we've seen the evidence of an anointed one on tape and in book but it's not just in tape and it's not just in book but there is a living God a living God that has manifested his power right here amongst the Church of the Living God and I want to say this this that I am proud to be identified with a people that have aligned themselves and have matched themselves up according to the same faith that was in Paul I want to say I'm proud to be a part of a people that refus to get in the swing of things of what the rest of the world is doing I'm proud to be a part of the Church of the Living God that refuses to be a part of leosia that refuses to be a part of Satan's snares and Satan's eeden I'm proud I am so proud to be a part of a people that have lined themsel up according to the faith that's worth contending for Hallelujah when you look out upon the rest of the world they don't see like you see it they don't understand like you understand you look at the disciples when they when they were walking with Jesus they saw Christ but the Pharisees saw beot the woman at the well she saw Messiah the woman with the alabaster box what did she recognize in him that he was worth everything that she had she had took all of her money and she spent all her righteous living she' done everything every evil deed but when she saw this man she saw something different about this man than what she'd ever seen in anybody else she saw something about I'll say that she saw the lamb she saw that this man was worth everything that she'd worked for all of her life all of her evildoings she saw something that was worth pouring out her fortune on Hallelujah she saw the lamb but the Pharisees and the Sadducees saw a false prophet you see what the difference was is that the seed that was in that woman was not in those men the seed that was on the inside of that woman at the well was not in the Pharisees the major difference between them between the elect and the non-elect is the seat of God you see the reason why you respond to the word of the word of this hour is because there has been a jean seed of God that has been deposited in this hour and you watch what William brandham does in these last closing statements of his of his life he's standing there and he's pushing it through 1963 but you come down to the last five services that William Brandon preaches and he is pushing he is pushing pushing he is pushing that there is a jingit of God that is the very image of almighty God he is pushing it and I want to say exactly like William brandham said it that the seed that goes in the ground has got to come up and what has been deposited by the message of the hour will simply bring forth a message grown Church you see the seed that goes down has got to come back up again you see the expectation of the swer knows what he seed into the ground he knows where he's dropped Faith he knows where he's dropped Grace he knows where he's dropped persuasion he knows where he's dropped perseverance he knows those things he knows what he's deposited in you so he is actually Hallelujah he is actually looking for you to manifest what has been deposited Hallelujah there's some seed that is appointed that is appointed to fall on the Wayside there are some seed that is appointed that they're going to fall they're going to fall on Stony ground but there is some seed that is appointed not to wrath but it is appointed for birth it is appointed for Glory and there is some seed that's going to find itself in the word of God in the ground of the word of God that will manifest what he deposited I want to say the seed that is on the inside of you matches what the Rapture is I will say this about you that the seed that is on the inside of you proves that you're a Divinity a Divinity class of people a people that is called to come up a little bit higher I want to say this that you're not just a chicken you're not you don't have the seat of a chicken on the inside of you you don't have the seat of a Hulk on the inside of you you don't have the seat of a buzzard on the inside of you but you have been caught up like it said in Revelation chap 4 come up here a little bit higher and the reason why you're a able to come up a little bit higher is because what has been deposited your reaction to the word of God proves what's on the inside of you let me say this to you there's a lot of people that have came and have amened the word of God then then they walked out the door and never allowed the word of God to fix them or change their situation but what is the proving and vindicating fact is let the storms come let the Trials come let situations come let Satan do his worst and that seed Remains the Same Hallelujah you see you have received a word of a different level from a different environment from a different atmosphere because an eagle in the natural is unmatched in his eyesight there's not another bird that can see like an eagle sees there's not another bird that can Fly Like an Eagle flies you see a buzzard cannot follow an eagle where he is going a chicken cannot follow an eagle where he is going that eagle is born for a specific season and reason for what he is born in and he knows exactly what he's born to do and that's why God would liken His prophets under Eagles is because they are Divine seeders of the word of God they are elected to be able to see what what others cannot see that's why this message this fourth Beast that has rose up to give you an anointing of a Rapture anointing to allow you to see past the denominations and the Creeds this message has given you an ability to match the realm of faith that you are built for this message gave you that access let me say this without this message you cannot access the Realms of faith that is predestined it for a third pool kind of people I ain't just talking about miracles here I'm talking about I'm talking about natural life living out a gospel Christian Life you cannot access the faith to overcome leosia with Billy Graham's message you cannot access the faith to overcome leosia with orl Robert's message but with a message from a king you have access to overcome the Realms of Darkness right here in the midst of Le Osa you are a people that are built to enter into a city and Jesus would test this faith in people to see whether they really had it or not to see to see what if they could prove who they were because Jesus would deny them rights and they would still press on because when you go to reading the scripture that you find that the woman of can of the SOP phenician woman when she came to him and said thou son of David have mercy upon my daughter she is grievously vexed with the devil Jesus turned to her and said I am not given to your race of dogs he called her a dog but even in all of that she was so perseverant that she turned to him that she turned to him and said Lord that's the truth you see she had no rights Hallelujah she had no rights on him as the son of David but when she addressed him Hallelujah as who he was her faith and her language matched up to what he was come on somebody she was a gentile woman she didn't have rights to him as a son of David but as the lord of the Harvest he seen that seed laying there and he called to it and said I've not seen such great faith in all of Israel brother mam said it in this way when she was walking back home he said she passed her pastor that was the pastor of the Goddess that she was serving and said what are you doing following that man she said he told me that my daughter was going to be perfectly whole he said she was in a fit when I left the home she was having one of them demon fits when she left when I left the home home but when she got back home the faith that she had to call him Lord had matched in her body I'm talking about a people that know how to match thems up to the word of God you're getting ready to see something that the rest of the world has not entertained before brother random said in the Feast of trumpets he said the bride is with the word are one he said how can there be one when that word that's wrote in there becomes in you and makes you and the word become one it's like a man and a wife and theyve made a decision that they're going to be husband and wife she can she can dress the part she can look the part he can tell her that she's going to be his but she is never his until he accepts her as his wife she can come down the altar she can have the dress on she can have all the all the all the elements of a of a of a beautiful bride she can have her flowers in her hand she can have all the elements of a bride of a wife and a bride but until he makes her his own she is simply just another woman but when he accepts her as a wife she then is identified no longer as Twain but it's one and that's what William brandham said that's the way the message is you can't sympathize with it and say it's right but you've got to take it to yourself to become a part of it then you and the message become one then the anointing with you the anointing is with you as it was with others so we don't want to just be sympathizers of the message we want to be conformed to the very image of the word of God we don't want to be just AG Greers of the word but we want to be men and women of action as a the Bible said in John James 1 and22 that be ye doers of the word that word doer means to be a performer of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's La un to a man beholding his natural face in the glass so we want our testimony to be the same thing as what we're hearing we want our actions come on somebody we want our actions to be in line with what we're hearing if Caleb and Joshua don't stand up and prove what they are saying or what they have heard for prophecy for for 400 years if they don't act out what the part that they are to do they're simply hearers of it but Caleb and Joshua Stood Still and they stealed the people and said we're more than able to take it it proved that what they had heard and what they were saying was exactly in line with what was spoken to Abraham we want to be performers of the word is that right we want to be performers of the word not just am manners of the word we want to be a performer of the word that like Jesus said in Matthew 18 and 19 that again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst of them how do you do that brother Andrew be a performer of the word we don't want to just sit around and say that we we don't want to sit around and say that we just have gathered on message we didn't come here just to talk about the message we come here to get in the message to be a performer of the word is to do what Deuteronomy 22 and5 says the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord my God so if you see a woman that's professing to be a Christian and dressing herself up like a jezebel she is not a performer of the word of God if you see a man that's professing to be a Christian and's got skinny jeans tighter than a jumpsuit dresses up like a woman acts like a woman he's not a performer of the word we want to match everything we want to be performers of the word right so the Bible said we want to be in line with the Bible so the Bible said in Malachi 3:8 will a man rob God yet Heath robbed me be but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings you are cursed with a curse for you robbed me even this whole nation bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there might be meat in my own house and prove me now therewith we want to be performers of the word don't we I love when you study out the Hebrew of this word prove me it is it is pronounced beon which means to prove I love studying out the Greek and Hebrew it gives you a different Dynamic of the word it it means to investigate it means to examine it means to prove it means to tempt it means to try so God says bring all your tithes into the storehouse that there might be meat in my house and investigate me and temp me and examine me now we got a chief investigator right here in the house tonight and I I when you begin to investigate you've got to turn over over every corner you got to turn over every corner when you begin to investigate because you don't want to miss any detail and God says God is saying go throughout all the testimonies in the land and investigate me see if I won't back up my word try me with it one time T me with it one time I put me on trial put me on trial and see if I will not open unto you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it if we want to be performers of the word we want to align our s with all the word and if somebody has taught you that you don't have to pay TI it's a false teaching and it's not matching up to the message of the hour what are you saying brother Angel I'm saying that if you've got the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy Ghost then you will perfectly line up to all the word of God I personally I'm just lining some scriptures out I don't have I don't have intentions here I'm just lining scriptures out I got more to go but I personally don't want to be identified with anybody in business or in preaching or in music or in teaching or anybody that is willing to Rob god of what is rightfully his I'll be honest I'll be de honest with you if brother William if all these brothers that that we come here that are we allowed to preach if they're not tithes payers we don't want them behind this popit because God has already cursed him if you got the Holy Ghost you want to be a performer of the word that right we want to be performers of the word then there's a whole there's a whole scheme of things that people say that we shouldn't do those things no more but we want to be performers of the word of God right we want to match up to what Peter preached we want to match up to what Paul preached we want to match up to what the scripture said and Jesus said in Mark 16 and 15 go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature perform my word he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved and he that believeth sh and but he that believeth not shall be damned be a performer of the word and these signs shall follow them that believe in mine in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues be a performer of the word I gave man you don't talking about in tongues brother Andrew but back off him ties just a little bit be a performer of the word and you shall take up serpents be a performer of the word and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover let me say if Paul laid hands on the sick then I got a right to lay hands on the sick if Peter laid hands on the sick then I've got a right to lay hands on the sick come on somebody if Mary spoke in tongues then I've got a right to speak in tongues if David danced then I've got a right to Dance come on somebody if Jeremiah said I would not speak no more but it was like fire shut up in my bones then let's be a performer of the word [Music] now be a Christian to be a Christian is real simple is to be Christlike another man I'm going lay some things here in the saman church age is it okay if I go Treacher on y'all just a minute that's part teacher part preacher he said now here is my point we'll see how well I do with this now here is my point he said to many of our modernist and even our fundamentalist so-called believe on salvation at a certain specific time in which many is called making a decision that has been called receiving Christ of being born again now to receive Christ is to receive his Spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again I love how simple I love how simple he tells this is as men that want to make it so complicated he said but to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen these folks believe he said that's wonderful he said but they stopped there he said you receive the Holy Ghost after you believe you see when Peter stood up there on the day of Pentecost and he took them he took them to Acts 2:38 and he told them and gave them by Revelation the prescription on how to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he got these directions and those directions came as a direct answer from Peter relative to what actually happened at Pentecost so he gave these directions by Revelation by what happened at Pentecost they had believed they had received the word and they were up there waiting on it they believed it then they received it he said what came to pass was that God according to Joel was pouring out the promised Holy Spirit upon All Flesh he was he was not poured out before that time or given even before that time this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting and being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came from now on to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God and then God and then God was Duty bound to fill the ones who came Peter or any other Apostles never said you must be born again and then filled with the spirit that this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the Holy Spirit note carefully the very next time that the spirit fell upon the people was in Acts chap 8 verse 5 I just going to skip through this chapter real quick but the Bible say then verse 5 then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ unto them verse 12 said but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ they were baptized both men and women they' heard the word it had been preached they believed on it then they were baptized verse 14 and when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word they sent unto them Peter and John who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for it has yet it for for as yet he was Fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus so according to verse 12 they believed the word they were then baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all of that they had still not received re the Holy Spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly that they received the Holy Ghost that is the exact pattern as set forth by Peter in Acts 2 and 38 there's not one scripture in all the Bible where the disciples or the apostles baptized in any other name but by the name of Jesus like my granddaddy Homer said if you can find it in the scripture where GE where his disciples or Jesus baptized in any other way he said rip that page out put it some mayonnaise on it and I'll eat it right in front of you give you the deed to my house give you the deed to my car because you're not going to find it in the scripture so if you're going to receive power you've got to match the experience by the word of God and right we don't want to just match our emotions by what we're feeling but we want to match the word in every aspiration of our life in our Ambitions in our job in our dreams in our Focus I had the kids I I call them kids they about bigger than me some of them but I had our youth group going through the absolute this week and pulling out quotes that that spoke to them specific spefically and I tell you parents you ought to be real proud of your kids they they pulled out some they pulled out some Dynamic quotes and I was I was real proud of them but there brother random brother random starts talking about in the absolute and he starts talking about a friend that there goty named old Jim Po and he said we used he said we used to hunt and and fish and all them things sh Po and he said we just good buddies he said but he said but Jim PO he said he was always a fan of reading them books and he said he he got to reading them books and he's got talking about he's reading about hunting and he read read about trapping and reading about fishing and all them different things and everywhere they went Jim was reading about them books and brother R said Jim he said them's fine he said but that's somebody else that's done that he said but I want to do that I want to go out there and trap I want to go out there and hunt he said I want my own experience I want my own experience I don't want to just talk about Paul's preaching I don't want to just talk about Peter's preaching I don't want to just talk about William brandom's preaching I don't want to just talk about Homer phaser I don't want to just talk about Mark Spencer Ron Spencer Charlie Spencer Ed Bisal I want my own experience and when we have a personal experience it lines up with the word of God then all of Heaven is there to back up what he spoke he said it I believe it that settles it the Bible said in numbers 15 and 38 that there that they would have that they would have fringes around the garments blue fringes that would hang around the garments and you begin to read in Matthew chapter 9 and 20 about a woman with a blood issue that she comes in there and she she's had this Blood issue for 12 years she's had this Blood issue with 12 years went to every doctor spent everything that she had but she doesn't had enough and she knew what the had Hallelujah she knew what the scripture said that she had no right to be there but it was her last dit desperate desperation effort that she was going to do and she wed through the crowd and touched the Hem of His Garment and immediately Mark said that her blood issue was dried up well you start reading Matthew chapter 14 that Jesus starts doing Miracles he starts feeding the 5,000 he starts feeding the 4,000 and there's a multitude that is following him and before long Jesus his Fame is going before himself before he can ever get there he's already there you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying before he ever got here he was already here before the preacher ever got in the pulit he was already here are you with me are you hearing what I'm saying so before Jesus ever got into the city where they were his Fame had went before him and the Bible said they brought to him lame hot diseased and they came and the multitude just heard they'd heard about this woman in Matthew chapter n and the Bible said that there was many that pressed through the crowd just to Touch the Hem of His Garment the fame of this woman that had matched the faith of numbers 15 they'd heard about it they' heard about it and they realized that if she could do it then we can do it too you hear what I'm saying to you come on if Georgie Carter could do it come on somebody if Enoch could do it then I can do it if Elijah could get on a chariot and take off then I can do it come on somebody if Peter walked on water then I can do it Hallelujah if Peter could go through sicks and none of them things moved him then I can do it don't you tell me he can't do it don't you tell me that I can't I done seen too many vindications in the word of God that proved to me that he still Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever hallelujah hallelujah what's the matter with you brother Andrew I'm getting old Jesus starts telling us he starts telling us about a woman Matthew 25 he starts taking us to a woman he tells us that at the Midnight Hour The Virgins came out there's 10 virgins five wise five foolish they all had the Holy Ghost they all had oil to begin with but they ran out of refilling oil but in the darkness when the darkness when everybody else was running out they had a supply there was a woman that had a supply of the oil because she knew that things were going to get heart you see the you see the disciple or you see the you see the denominations they not too long ago there were I don't know have I had it there's a man there's a preacher a tell evangelist that held up this message and said what he preached is absolutely the truth but we can't preach it held up the message of William Bram and said that's nothing but the the truth but we can't preach it and we can't live it and they're calling for oil them for them them FAL them them The unwise Virgins they're calling for oil they realize they're without it but there is an elect lady that has more than enough to make it through come on somebody these five ladies are always on time they have more than enough they have more than enough a heaven to back them up they have enough come on somebody come on you've got more than enough to make it you've got everything you have need of when you receive the message of the hour these five ladies are perfectly on time what watch it what is it they have watched the signs of Heaven they have watched what God has done here on Earth they have watched and they've heard a shout they've heard a shout and she's come out to meet her bridegroom and she is matching the bridegroom's call when the others went to buy oil she didn't have to buy it she'd already got it you hallelujah sister Gabrielle it's everything it's everything you ever had need of the very first time the very first time you got the Holy Ghost was more than enough I'm not just talking about a gift but I'm talking about the angel of the Lord I'm talking about the person of Christ becoming one with you and you becoming one with him you have accepted him but he's accepted you and you are matching him I will now call her a woman for she has come out of man she is bone of my bone she's a life of my life what does Jesus see when he looks on this Miss Jesus Christ there's plenty of women in the land but there's only one Katie Spencer there's plenty of churches in the land but there's only one bride of Jesus [Applause] Christ hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Brother brother brandham is is called to a a family situation it's called to a family situation it's a it's a boy and a girl that's that's gotten himself into some some trouble in a relationship brother brandom starts laying some things down in 1963 64 65 about the strain of humanity he starts laying those things in there that the things that are pass down mother mam starts talking about this about this couple there in the message parad and you can go and listen to it I have it here in front of me and I'll send it to you if you if you want it all but if you just look up you just look up the word German and strain you'll be able to find it brother bar starts talking about this talking about this situation that this boy had done he'd walked away from a relationship and he wouldn't apologize about it he was wrong in the situation he wouldn't he wouldn't apologize for it brother marom starts going in there he said some of these things he said they're he said they're hard to say he said but they're true he said you've got to be honest in all the things and he said he said you look at the strain in that family he said that mother he said she's real she's real German he said nothing against German people he said he said but there's a strain there in them German people and he said they'll just sit there and they'll stare at you and they won't say a word and I'm afraid we got a whole lot of German Christians sit there and look at you in the face won't say nothing won't say Amen I'm sorry that fit too good he said but she he said she'd just sit there and not say a word to you or anything like that and the daddy was an Irish man hi tempered High strong and he said now he said he said now this boy as a Believer he said as a Believer he'd been he'd repented he'd B been baptized he said but he not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said now brother Ram goes in here and lays some very powerful things he said now thinking you got the Holy Ghost and having the Holy Ghost is two different things he said just because you have the emotions of the spirit of dancing and speaking in tongues and shouting and Sensations and running and jumping he said him think are all right he said but just to have that ain't enough you see you've got to have a life to back it up come on somebody that devil ain't scared when you jump that devil ain't scared when you shout that devil ain't scared when you get get Sensational it blesses you and it blesses God but that devil ain't scared about it that devil ain't scared about it unless there's a life there to back it up but when there's a life to back up your dance and a life to back up your shout and a life to back up your sensation then there's not a devil in hell that can rock you off of your experience by the word of God brother man would would lay in there about the the strain of this boy of his family that that his German nature and his Irish nature and he said that father is his family nature was high strung he said they was drunk he said they was he said they was high tempered they were high strung he said and you start searching those things out he said you look at it he said the parents of that boy the the jeans were laying there and brother brandham says this about them parents he said them parents had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but them jeans he said them complexes that was there in the strain of that boy's life he said even though his parents had the Holy Ghost he said that boy still dealt with that complex of the flesh it shows that God is no granddaddy that he you have to be a child of the word of God God that you've got to have a personal experience by a birth by a new generation by a new birth is that right he said but you look he he's talking to the parents he said now you look he said you look at your life he said you was you was this way you was high-tempered you were high strong he said but what gave you that forgiving and loving spirit that you got he said it's the Holy Spirit he said look at your family he said they'll just stare at you and look at you in the face he said but what gives you that nature he said it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and brother random starts dealing with this boy he said even in his intellects he said he can't over coming and the daddy got you know how daddy does gets a little bit up well my boys done been to the altar I'm quoting the prophet he said my boy's been to the altar my boy's been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ correctly he said that might be so he said but he's never went all the way yet he never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet he said he's simply trying to overcome he's simply trying to overcome that complex in his own intellect he said he said until he said until he's regenerated and born again he said I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in him he said but when it does he said that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between a mother and a father and Y and his intellects trying the best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it he said but Christ will overcome it for him when he lets Christ in then he's already overcame it well how do you overcome brother Andrew you got to keep life in you you got to keep life in you you can't be here you can't be on fire for God today and out of fire for God tomorrow you got to keep the life of the Holy Ghost remember when brother man was talking about how can I overcome and he's walking down that hill and he goes across that log he said it's a fine looking log he said it it fell down was laying there in the water he said but he said on the outside he said it looked perfectly good he said but down on the inside of it he said I jumped up on it and a great big chunk fell off of it he said what was it he said it had laid there in that water and had became dead and Dodie and had let the life go out of it he said it's proof right there how to over come is to keep the life on the inside of you what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying this that to overcome famine you've got to stay in Feast come on now Amos 8 And1 tells us that the Bible says hallelujah that the Bible said that there will be a famine in the last days not for bread and water but it'll be for the very word of God but you're not in famine Church you're living in the Feast of the son of man where you're feeding daily on the unfailing body word hallelujah part three is coming God bless you would you stand with me I get to do that I'm a pastor if I was a if I was an evangelist I'd roll the whole whole Bell of hay
