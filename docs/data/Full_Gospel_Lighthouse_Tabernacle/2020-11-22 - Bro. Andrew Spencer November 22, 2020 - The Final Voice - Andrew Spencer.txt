========================================

[Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] see how we can rest upon his word then no matter how hard the storm flows what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon the world amen god said it who've seen the other side of the storm so if you're sick just anchor your soul in the haven of rest [Music] if you're perplexed and distressed remember he said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world and he's pr he said all things work together for good to them that love the lord so just stay right there one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor holds within the veil what is the veil is something that shuts off here from there and the anchor is on the inside of the veil you don't see how it's going to be but you know that there's something that's got a hold of you that's got to hold up there and when the sea is blowing and starving did you ever i guess maybe somebody has never been privileged to see a ship anchored oh my i wrote him on it throughout a sea anchor like that until the little craft couldn't even go over the top of the wave it would go through the way but as long as the anchor helps that's all makes any difference whether we go over under around or through it doesn't matter the anchor holes that's the way when storms of life begin to shake us we may have to go through and they have to go over under around but just let the anchor hole within the veil to the unseen we don't know just exactly where it's at but it's a holding just like the little boy you know that had the kite you've heard the old proverb of the story said how you know you got a coyote in there so i can still feel it tugging so that's it if we can feel it still tugging god dealing with our hearts then we know our anchor still holds i believe it was benjamin franklin who caught the lightning in the bottle who harnessed lightning electricity something within him called and said there's power in that that power could be harnessed and if it's that powerful to shoot the streaks in the burst of timbers split over the ground what could it do if it was once harnessed it'll lighten flesh and hit the whole earth and benjamin franklin i believe fishing on his kite with a key tied on the end of the tail of a bottle down the bottom and when he got it he didn't know what he had but he began to scream i got it i got it he didn't know what it was he didn't know what he was going to do with it but he know he had something and that's the way with every man that's hopes are built on nothing less than jesus blood with righteousness all around my soul gives way that he's all my hope and state on christ's solid rock i stand all other grounds this sinking sins once born again the holy spirit takes its place into the heart some young people may not are young or maybe illiterate no matter how it is there's no one can explain it so don't feel bad because you're illiterate you couldn't explain it there's never been a man yet could explain it no matter how smart or how intelligent it's god's own secret amen but when that word takes life in your heart you see it you scream i got it amen you don't know what you're going to do with it you don't know what it's going to do with you but you know something's happened amen and you got it [Music] [Music] so [Music] i think [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] well i'm gonna let it shine this little light of

how we desire that that draw of the holy ghost o god lord to draw us into higher heights to take us past our thinking to be able to see what what you see father not what we see lord lord may we may we begin to pierce into the heavenlies lord this morning and and see the things of god that these things are pertaining to your people in this hour lord you you sent out a commission to go into the highways to the hedges and to compel them to come that my table might be full father we here again lift up our voice father and we compel the those out in the streets those out in the ways of life to come unto jesus father we pray as you begin to move across this congregation you've seen the hands that were lifted up father and only you could bless them father only you could minister to them in every walk of their life but i believe that you're so accurate in your word father that you can take and you can begin to pierce past the darkness pierce past the flesh father and begin to go into that realm and speak life father lord to their need that they would know that the messiah had spoken this morning lord we declare that you are god and there's no god but jehovah we express our love to you this morning our gratitude father and we pray that you would come down amongst us may you be high and lifted up in this place today as we begin to glorify the god of heaven as we begin to lift up the name that is above every name and to begin to praise you father may you come with a still small voice and stir our hearts into a fire of revival we pray in the name of jesus christ amen and amen god bless you if you have your bibles this morning we'll turn over in the book of exodus chapter 19 and verse 3 and then down to revelations chapter 10 verse 7. certainly enjoyed last night's service brother nathanael greene speaking for us last night on the promises of god and i certainly never grow tired of hearing about all of god's promises and and hearing about the things of god what a wonderful lord that we have as as a prophet would say if we would need a little bit more joy we just crime climb up on that ladder and grab it down for ourselves he's got all things provided for us he's he's the all-sufficient one this morning amen i'd like to speak to you today on the final voice the final voice to the final wage amen exodus chapter 19 and verse 3 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel you have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bear you on eagle's wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him also revelations chapter 10 and verse 7. brother johnny am i doing okay for you brother johnny am i doing okay for you okay all right i don't want to go too fast and if you do if i if you need to throw up your hand tell me slow down i'll i'll do my best my best revelations chapter 10 and verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which i heard from heaven spank unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open let's say that together which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book now we know that john represents the bride here verse 9 and i went as as john representing the bride and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth as sweet as honey that's what the word does it goes on the inside you go to digesting that word eating that word and it causes a war on the inside of you but when you speak that word when it comes across your lips it's sweet as honey and i took the little book out of the angel's hand notice what you do i took the little book out of the angel's hands and ate it up and it was in my mouth the sweetest honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord let's have church today i shared the quote with the brothers as we just go into this this morning so put that on the screen for you now as it is declared in malachi 4 and 6 that will turn the hearts of the children back to back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a vindicated prophet and give the exact truth as it was with paul he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works hallelujah do you see it i believe that as brother branham is saying those things i believe that he is speaking to you and i believe that he's looking at you that he's seeing a people that will truly manifest the lord jesus that will truly be his body truly perform his works and truly be his voice a momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this is this thought is in the dark ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people but god sent luther with with the word the lutheran spoke for god at that time but they organized and and again the pure word for the loss was lost for organization tends towards dogma and creeds and not simple words they could no longer speak for god then god sent wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his revelation from god became the 11 epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the methodist failed god raised up others so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age that's our fault this morning who under their messenger you cannot separate us from this message and you cannot separate us from the messenger are you with me i am i am proud to stand with william branham i'm proud to stand with the seventh messenger and i'm proud to be a part of this final voice to this final age we're not looking for something more we're here we're right here it's not a day coming it's not a day in the future but we're here you see yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god it is it is uh it is his own mouthpiece so god is turning on her notice he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelations verse and 17 that the spirit and the bride say come notice our hearts have been turned back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers that which paul preached we preach that what's peter preached we preached are you with me that which john preached that which john believed are you with me that which polycarp preached we believe that which william branham preached we believe we're not looking for a day off in the future for another people to come and take this book and run with it we are in the hour of a final voice and if you could recognize this morning that your voice is his voice his word is his voice and when you take this word you are no longer speaking your word you are speaking the literal life of jesus christ on written pages but it's no longer in a book it's in a people to express the godhead deity that god we know had a threefold purpose first that he would express god in christ secondly to have the preeminence in the church's people and then thirdly to restore the kingdom back to his rightful position we're not looking for another day but now is the day now are we the sons of god hallelujah we and the bride the bride and the spirit say the same exact thing hallelujah hallelujah we're living in a very powerful day living in a very permanent hour in a very very pressing time but a very powerful time you look at everything that's going on in the world you can see its pressing you can see darkness as it's trying to push out light but light just keeps pushing back and that light will never be put out because this light is that is shining is not you and i it is the light of the word that is shined upon this word and we see exactly where we are we're not looking off into some future we're not looking out into the eighth day that that we're looking for another people to come another messenger to come we have received a message that will produce a body change that has produced a bride for the body change [Applause] and she's standing on her feet and here we are living in this hour when hell has enlarged her gates and you watch as she keeps swallowing soul after soul after soul and it keeps taking men into that pit and it keeps swallowing men and it keeps and it looks like hell is on a rampage he's trying to take our young people trying to take our health trying to take our wealth trying to take our right mind but there is a people that's got her feet on the earth today that knows where she is that knows what he wants done with the word and she has thus saith the lord or she set steel this is a people that is not fighting the devil with a closed book she is fighting the devil with an open book that knows what he wants done with the word if he wants healing the bride will preach healing if he wants you to have deliverance the bride will preach deliverance hallelujah you are not speaking of something of days gone by the seven thunders have uttered their voices and the revelations of the seventh seal has been revealed before you hallelujah it's not six seals open it's seven seals open and you are fighting with an open book you ate this book you became this book it makes you the final voice to the final age glory be to god and the voice of god is in her he wants to use your voice this morning he wants to use her hands this morning he wants to use your feet this morning i know it's a paradox but god is wanting to he's so wanting to use your body and borrow your body as the prophet would say if he would give me a temporary resurrection that he would come and use my body i'd say oh jesus come this morning give us a temporary resurrection and use my body use my mouth use my hands use my feet use my mind i know it's a paradox just like it's a paradox to look out upon the moon and watch set that moon as the watchdog to watch over that sea to make sure that that sea doesn't go past it you see that moon is the one that controls those waves they can't get no higher than what the moon says those waves can't go in no further than what the moon says and you are a representative of jesus christ him being the son you be in the moon you were not put here so that the devil could control you you were put here you were put here to control the devil and tell him that you are not my father what you try to throw on me i give it back to you i know it's a paradox but you are sitting as god in slap flesh neighbor give them a high five i say i'm looking at god in flesh hallelujah hallelujah i've seen the voice speak the cripples and straighten them up i've seen the voice of god speak to the blind and his eyes come open to the dying cancer written to the leper and see them return back in flesh in the perfect health again i've seen him speak to the alcoholics and neurotics and all the off-cast and the skid robots and they become ladies and gentlemens and saints of the living god because the voice of god spoke that's what we listen for no matter your condition heaven speaking this morning no matter where you're at heaven's speaking this morning you see if you can make his word you're absolute you can you can make his word your absolute and any divine promise in the bible if you can tie your soul to it and you can no matter how much the waves whip you around you're still tied to that absolute no matter what comes you're still tied to it cancer may come but you're still tied to the absolute sickness may come but you're still tied to the absolute loved ones may pass away but you're still tied to the absolute you're not tied onto something that's wishy-washy you're tied unto the god of heaven he ain't changed his mind for 2000 years and he ain't planning on changing it now you are tied onto the almighty god i believe everything within me this weekend that god is speaking and god is calling i don't believe that the apostolic age is over but i believe it's still in session i believe it's still on i believe god's still calling i believe his holy spirit's still falling and i want to say to you that he'll come to you he'll come to you and no matter what condition you're in whether you're an alcoholic whether you're a prostitute whether you're a farmer whether you're a drug addict whether you're out in sin no matter your condition he'll come to you you just count on this god and he'll come calling to you this morning he's calling oh sinner come home if you're a prodigal now's the time to arise shake yourself come back to the father's kingdom there's a voice in the land that says come out of her my people come out of her woo hallelujah when rahab heard that message when she heard about the god of the universe that he was moving she knew that she could not stay in that condition no more but she wanted to be identified with that message that this was a message that was going to take her out of that condition is there anybody else that's identified with a message that took them out of their condition [Applause] hallelujah i remember what i was before this message there's a lot of people that put out their youtube pictures and their youtube videos on why i left the message i'd like to make a youtube video on why i'm in the message i'm in this message because it's changed my life i'm in this message because it's none other than jesus christ i was a drug addict i was an alcoholic but this message came by my way that's why i'm in the message as brother ron said you can't stop it [Applause] glory rahab heard that message she was identified with that message and she heard a voice tell her you apply that token you apply that token get everybody in here that you can and when she heard that message though the walls was falling all around her she was not looking at the walls she was looking at a token laodicea might be falling all around you but don't you get your eyes on laodicea don't you get your eyes on people falling away you get your eyes back on that token hallelujah you can't look out them doors you can't look out them doors as israel was looking out in this in egypt down there when they were looking out them doors and the blood was applied they couldn't look out their doors without seeing the blood and you can't look out these promises of god without seeing the blood-bound promises whoa we was at a funeral sister sister joyce sister linda we was at y'all's funeral at your mama's funeral back there down there down there in virginia and brother ron got to preaching and this man grabbed a hold of another guy while brother ron was preaching he grabbed a hold of his leg he said oh brother that's shouting material i'd say this morning you could grab your neighbor's needs say whoa that's shout material be careful who's new you grab that ain't my job that's your job hallelujah she responded to that voice and you watch the actions of her life how that she got everybody in let me tell you something when i heard this message i've done everything within my power to get everybody i know in hallelujah there ain't no other safety zone outside of this token there ain't no body change outside of this token are you with me there's no there's no jehovah outside of this token because it is jesus hallelujah have you heard your voice you see when you hear your voice called out it causes a reaction you can be walking through the airport and they can call your name and it causes a reaction but you can be walking through that same airport and there it's a bunch of gibberish going across that intercom and it ain't catching your attention one thing you ain't paying attention to it all you worried about is going to go get your bagel in your starbucks you're walking down through there you're going about your way but all of a sudden they say andrew spencer be at b-gate 12 right now or we're leaving you you know what i did i dropped my starbucks dropped my bagel and i ran on my way because i didn't want to get left behind and when i heard this voice i dropped everything that i was doing in life and i started running i started running to a gate he said i am the way i am the truth and i am the life i ran with everything that was within me to run to him [Applause] hallelujah and the church becomes a word when it lets the word go through them not above you but through you you see jesus would even say he would pray in john chapter 17 and nine he said i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all are mine are fine and thine of mine and i am glorified in them i and and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to be holy father keep through thy own name those whom now has given me that they may be one as we are one you see it's a people becoming one with god i caught this this week and who do you say this is in 1964 he said be warned as i am the father of one yay be that kind of one then how will that be the word in us would be the anointed word that is the oneness of god see the oneness of god is the word anointed in you close your bible walk out the door you just had church hallelujah the oneness of god is the word anointed in you not a dead word but an alive word and then you become a son a messiah of the age this is the day of adoption when you are so filled up with his life that it's no longer you and you sit there in your rightful position as a son as a daughter of god you have an inheritance this morning can i just say something to you i would say that if the tutor goes back to the father this morning he would go back and say well done i've watched your sons i've watched your daughters they do everything in your name they act in your name they praise in your name they worship in your name hallelujah and when that son goes out over that field he can act in the father's name though it may seem like it's so outreach and so out far out there he is acting in the father's name it may seem strange to the rest of the world the way you act you're not acting in your name you're acting in the father's name when he said lay hands on a sick and they shall recover you're not acting in your name you're acting in his name he said if you drink any deadly thing it shall not harm you you're not acting in your name you're acting his name i believe that if anything if you're behind something you'll put your name on it and jesus was so for his word in you that he would put his stamp of approval behind it and say you can do this in my name when you lay your hands on somebody it ain't you it's who you represent it's who you're acting as it's who you're representing as the god of heaven you're an ambassador of the kingdom of the most high god and when you lay your hands upon a brother and they might be sick sick unto death it doesn't say that they will immediately get well but they shall recover that's what it says he said these sites will follow them that believe you're not acting in your name you're acting his name and when you lay your hands upon them and they don't see a miracle and they give up on god don't you give up on his promise don't you make that feel like you didn't touch them right or you didn't lay your hands on them right they shall recover and if god said it that settles it [Applause] so many people get so upset i prayed i prayed i prayed i prayed i prayed sounds like a broken record and i didn't see nothing happen they shall recover you go to the doctor you go to that doctor because you got a sinus infection you got a cold you got something you're scared about something they give you this medicine you go through the process of going to the doctor you really don't want to be there they set you down on this cold table tell you to put this down on you don't want to be there you're forking out money that you really can't afford to fork out and he says it's such and such of this he spends four minutes with you and you allow him to put a shot on the backside of you and you really don't want to be there he gives you 18 pills that you got to take one every hour you really don't want to take them and you finally get so fed up i'm done taking them pills and you throw them in a trash what good was it doing you to go to the doctor that you didn't want to go there in the first place for if you ain't gonna take the medicine that he gave you [Applause] hello they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover if you're good enough to sit here and eat my chicken eat my preaching believe what i say i'm not saying what andrew spencer says i'm saying what jesus said i'm just here for the goodie bags at christmas time you can sit here and get your goodie bags or you can sit here and get whole i'm just here for the christmas dinner bad luck this year you ain't getting a christmas dinner [Applause] glory to god i come to church just to see other people well you ain't even seen the other half of the congregation in the last three months i'm sure you didn't come to church for that i'm not preaching to you anyway i'm just preaching to those backsliders that think they're right and they never will get right backsliders will never be a final voice to the final age but a real son and daughter of god that stands up for god that don't back up us his promises will stand right here in the midst of kovic in the midst of laodicea she will be a final voice to a final age give her chicken give her a goody bag it ain't going to matter her she's only focused on eating one thing let's say if the lord just saith the lord i got your goodie bag this morning you ain't got to worry about no nut allergy you ain't got to worry about chocolates you ain't got to worry about a diet if you eat this you're going to get fat go ahead and eat this with me let's get spiritually back together you'll take a doctor's word you'll listen to him you'll sit there and obey everything he says but he said if you obey my voice that i will be an enemy unto thine enemies that i will be an adversary to your adversaries that the diseases that i put upon them in egypt i put on the amorites i put on the perez heights i put on all them things if you'll just obey my voice and what a hard thing it is for people to do today they can't even stick with their own word much less god's word [Applause] but i don't believe this bride's wishy-washy i have to say the bride ain't shook up about covet ho ho ho ho that brother angel i said the bride ain't shook up about covet let the storms rage we've got the stabilizers on the ship the bride ain't worried about covet i'm not saying that we go out and act foolishly but we're not worried about what covet does i'm not worried about who gets in office i'm not worried about who becomes our governor i'm not worried about that i am only interested in one thing that's king jesus [Applause] if he said it i believe it he said that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven and he said where two or three of you agree touching one thing let it be done let it be done this morning you are acting in his name hallelujah hallelujah calm yourself [Applause] you're preaching scares me brother andrew well let me move on i don't want to scare you so i'll just keep preaching if you get tired of this you have the right to walk out but if you enjoy this you have the right to stay amen notice in hebrews 11 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do not appear you see now notice oh my when god speaks all heaven records it i tell you it's got to happen no matter how funny it seems and how unreasonable it seems it's going to happen anyhow because god said it was and my words will be fulfilled in their season now notice in god's preparation he said now you better believe god that's right when god speaks anything it's going to happen anyhow no matter if all the whole rest of the church world downs it god's going to bring it to pass anyhow faith looks past what you can see the very world that we stand on was created created out of things which do not appear when jesus was walking with the ruler of israel by the name of jairus when he was walking with him when they told him that his daughter was sick and somebody came running and said trouble the master no more your daughter has died jesus kept walking jesus realized the authority in his words and jesus kept walking death had done knocked on the door but jesus kept walking there's a lot of things that was knocking on your door but jesus came walking and he didn't stop because of the circumstances that was in your life you was messed up you was wrecked up you was in sin you was in chain but jesus kept on walking why did jesus keep walking because he knew the end result of your life when everybody else around you criticized you said you never lived right said you never make it don't go back there you just kept following what he [Applause] said ain't that right hallelujah jesus is not concerned about what everybody else is doing he's got his eyes on you brother mike he's got his eyes on you sister joyce he's got his eyes on you and he's walking when jesus walked in the room and everybody was mourning jesus said these words she's not dead she's only asleep and the bible said that they laughed him to scorn in other words they embarrassed him by criticizing him but did that bother jesus jesus began to speak in another realm he knew that she was only sleeping and she began to say he began to speak in another language and he said to lethe he called me daughter arise and though that one looked like she was dead jesus knew where she was at jesus knew that she was just asleep it's time for you that sleep oh wake up thou that sleepless shake yourself one more time i pray the spirit of god speak over you talithi comey daughter arise sunrise get up out of that condition get up out of that fear get up out of that get up out of that jesus has come by your way today at full gospel lighthouse now the devil may come on monday morning and he may try to beat you around the emotions that you felt on this weekend but you received thus saith the lord let the devil have all he wants to let him rage all he wants to you got thus saith the lord and he ain't going to stop but saith the lord so we can't stop your faith in thus saith the lord so just say satan get behind me [Applause] as brother mark spencer sings that song my eyes are on the prize oh satan get behind me because one day you won't find me oh satan you can get all shook up you can get all messed up try to wreck up my life try to destroy my life but you can't stop me because my eyes are on the prize paul would say i am i pressed towards mark paul would say in philippians 3 he said he said though as i had not attained but i pressed towards a mark if paul could say though i have not attained it yet and paul being the greatest messenger the first messenger of the bible to write 14 bibles 14 chapters of the bible and paul would say though i have not attained yet that gives me a little bit of hope this morning are you with me paul paul who was a learned scholar paul they had to get knocked off of his high horse hey sometimes people get a need to get knocked off their high horse their high horse thinking well i'm this tall i'm this big i know this many quotes i know all about the bible you need to get knocked off your high horse and see a light of the holy ghost it's coming faster than i could speak it out but paul said i have not attained but i pressed towards it if paul could stand there and say those things i ain't getting that maybe i ain't necessarily attained everything but i'm still going to keep on going maybe i don't understand everything the seven messenger said but i'm gonna keep on going i'm gonna keep on preaching i'm gonna keep on living maybe i don't know everything about how the healing's coming how the miracle's coming but i'm pressing let satan press all he wants to you press him back you're not focused on what satan's got to say you're focused on thus saith the lord you were seen there how many agrees on that thought you were seen there before the foundation of the world you were seen there a voice spoke a voice spoke to you didn't he sister stephanie and he told you to be here he told you that you'd not only be here but you'd be there ain't that right ain't that what he said he'd you'd be there if the voice of god spoke that let all the other chaos of life the voices of life the expressions of life let them do what they want to i heard a voice let all the other chickens do what they want to down on the ground i was built for flying they didn't recognize this call but i did they didn't flop their wings like i did i kept on flopping it looked like i was doing some kind of crazy topsy-turvy flip over thing when i was just getting my wings but let me give my wings just a little bit and you watch me soar don't you get shook up don't you get shook up on what this person doing or what that person doing don't you get shook up i ain't even shook up about it and if i ain't shook up about it there's no reason that you should get shook up about it just let them you just let god take over it may look like they're a little bit wobbly here and there but if they are an eagle if that predestinated seeds on the inside of them they're gonna get up they're gonna wake up they're gonna get above the barn they're gonna keep on soaring go above the mountains you gave confidence in this voice are you with me you can have confidence in this voice willie upshaw had confidence in that voice when he sat in that condition for so many years he sat there in that condition stayed in that condition but finally he heard a voice that said i see a man i see a man that is a that is an upstate man that is that is a well-known man he said i didn't know who he was they said you're speaking about congressman upshaw he said i didn't know who he was he said i'd sit in this condition sitting in a wheelchair deal with him crutches all of his life but that voice spoke to him mr upshaw do you have a brown suit i sure do i just purchased it yesterday where'd that voice come from it had to come from another world and he said mr upshaw thus saith the lord you're healed congressman up shaw witnessed this he said now he said brother branham knows the mind of the lord even when he didn't know the mind of the lord he put his confidence in what that messenger said he knows the mind of the lord i'll just stand up and when he took that prophet's word he rose up completely whole what was it the voice knew his future oh you oughta just been tore down the chandeliers right there this voice just doesn't know about your past he knows about your future hallelujah though satan has sworn destruction over you this voice knows your future sure there's another voice in this world there's another voice in this world that's condemning everything that you do ain't that right young people ain't that right young people there's another voice in this world that condemns everything that you stand for it condemns you for wearing your hair long sisters it condemns your brothers for not dressing like a bunch of gay queers it condemns you sisters for dressing holy but that voice is just a voice with the other voices of the world that will pass away but he said heaven and earth will pass away but my voice will never pass away condemn me oh you want to voice of the world but i am listening to a voice of another world we're the people stand on this everybody gets shook up about the first and the second amendment they're worried about what the government's going to do they're shook up about everything that that the government is putting in place in this day but they will allow the same people will allow the devil to steal their god-given rights it shows you what voice they're listening to [Music] they're going to take your guns brother andrew let them take them i don't plan on using them over in the millennium they're going to take your house they're going to take your car let them have it i believe we need to live in peace while we're here i do as well but i ain't so disturbed by what fox news and cnn says that i allow it to determine my predestination some people get so upset because the world is falling apart have you not heard a message of 1963 and 1965 he told you it was coming i'm not shook about a world falling apart i am shook up about a kingdom that's not made with hands he's going to prepare a place for me and it's not krispy kreme or chick-fil-a he's going to prepare a place for me that where i am that where he is i will be there too don't get shook up about i just talked about your blow baby angels here hallelujah some of you get it today i know i got some some believers hallelujah now notice these excerpts from the message he said now when god speaks he gives strength when god speaks it's forever settled in heaven when god speaks to you you do what he tells you and when god speaks all hell moves that's everything that can stand in his presence i believe god still got a voice and god's got a people on earth today that'll live us out notice this about columba the messenger that after after the saint patrick had died that columba come on the scene he was born there in donegal ireland where our precious brother george our brother george quinn is there and notice about columbia that after he heard the voice of god nothing could stop him and his miraculous ministry had had caused many historians to acclaim him next to the apostles so great was his ministry with the supernatural science following that some especially students in rome have thought the accounts were exaggerated in one of his missionary journeys he approached a walled city he found the gates barred against him he lifted his voice in prayer that god might intervene and allow him to access the people in order to preach but as he prayed the court magicians began to harass him with loud voices he then to begin to sing a psalm as he's saying god so increased the volume of his voice that he drowned out the cries of the heathen and suddenly the gates burst open on their own accord what a messenger he entered in and preached the gospel winning many souls to the lord on another occasion when he was also shut out from the village as he turned away to depart the son of the chief of the village suddenly became violently ill even unto death and saint columba was quickly sought after and recalled when he prayed the prayer of faith the boy was instantly healed and the village was then opened to the evangelization of the gospel hallelujah if he could stand there with a closed book he could pray he could preach he could sing how much more should we standing in a day with an open book with the mysteries being revealed how much more should we break these strongholds how much more should we press against the gate how much more should we listen to this voice i'm gonna i'm gonna come down to some things and i want you to stay with me and the sermon looking to the unseen he said now now there's a there's a man here in a wheelchair and he said now now he's wanting to be saved but not only is he wanting to be saved he said he's got a cancer in his lung he said sir i found it amazing i had these things in my note brother nate goes down through his this line of the leper setting at the gate and here he he said one time there was lepers that were sitting at a gate one time they said if we stay here we're going to die here but if we get up and go into the city we can go down there at least at least we can go down there he said sir if you stay in that condition you're going to die right there he said but rise up and be well and go to praising him he said now you go he says have no audience go to praising him go to praising him go to praising him go to praising him all of a sudden he says here he comes up out of that wheelchair [Applause] he said praise him praise him and all of a sudden there came a voice that says i'm the lord that raised up christ from the grave i'm the one that sent the holy ghost i'm the one that gave the promise brother branham has nothing to do in this he surrendered his life to me i'm using his spirit i'm talking through his lips that's me i'm the lord [Applause] oh god i pray today that you so borrow this body that you'd speak through the lips of humanity that we would see the godhead poured out amongst us i knew that was going to happen boo devil this is not a time to stay in your condition there's been a voice that said get up out of that condition there's been a voice that would scream out and say you could stay there or you're gonna die you can stay in your sinful condition and go to a devil's hell hell was created for the devil and his angels and you were not meant to be there if you go to hell it's your choice you cross over the blood to get there but there's a voice that's crying get up out of that condition rise up out of that wheelchair rise up out of that sin rise up out of that cancer [Applause] what if he would say what if he would say today i'm the one that gave the promise i'm the one that did this i'm the one that sent the holy ghost i'm the one that gave the promise what if he would say andrew spencer has nothing to do in this he surrendered his life to me i'm using his spirit i'm talking through his lips that's me i'm the lord how would you respond to that how would you act to that would you get up out of your condition would you rise about that or would you sit there in that condition and stay at that gate and die would you see this as a voice of god or would you see this as a voice of man you've got to make a choice today either you're going to follow this voice i'm not talking about my voice i'm talking about his voice you either follow this voice and go to heaven or you do not follow this voice and go to a devil's hell this voice will change your life the devil's voice will destroy your life this voice will transform you the devil's voice will rob you of health he'll rob you of your strength he'll rob you of your family he'll rob you of your income but god is only one to use you today he's wanting to borrow your body he's wanting to use your lips i've seen this voice call out diseases i've seen this voice call out sickness i've seen this voice say you're not from here you're way far out i see you in your addresses 318 a and a half notice the accuracy of the word this was not the voice of a seventh grade kentuckian this was the voice of god hallelujah we believe he's here this morning hallelujah could you imagine could you imagine how jesus felt when he's standing there and the scoffers passed him by that broke out their rules they broke out their regulations and jesus was nothing but a common man to them that was blaspheming what they called was a holy ghost and they missed him they missed him they measured him according to their statures and wondered now this can't be him and they missed him can you imagine how jesus felt when they turned him down when he was the one that was speaking that i and the father are one and they missed him but could you imagine how jesus failed in revelations chapter 1 as he's standing there as jesus is walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks as he's walking there holding the seven stars in his right hand his hand of power as he's holding them and each of them represent a messenger of the day and he has so built that messenger that they would be characterized to each age that they would be built in such a way that it would attract the attention of the bride in that day he built them in such a way can you imagine as he would release the first messenger and he would go out and he would go out with that message and it would bring in he would go out and he would pull in the elective that day could you imagine how jesus felt knowing that they were in his hand that he had so molded them that they would be built according to the nature that he placed in them that they would bring in he would release he would release the second messenger the third message or the fourth messenger imagine as jesus is watching his handiwork as he's standing there as that messenger has been dipped in that oil he's been dipped in that same oil that came down from above he's come down he's dipped in that oil he's got the same life he's got the same power he's got the same word you imagine how jesus is watching how all of these things are playing out this is how i predestined it this is how it's been ordained this is how it's going to go and jesus watches as the elect come to that word as they come to that message as they get pulled in by the message of that day could you imagine in this day when he's watching the final messenger roll off of his fingertips hallelujah as he's watching as william branham goes and he goes out and he releases william branham with certain characteristics with a certain message that will attract the people of the last day that she will receive this message and she will hear this as the final message that this that she will receive that message she will be a final voice to the final age that she will be a people in action she's dipped in the same oil she's got the same life she's got the same power can you imagine how jesus is watching this morning how he feels as he's looking out upon a congregation and said that's my voice that's my people that's my bride that's my wife i'm so proud to stand with her i'm so proud to be a part of her there's nothing that the devil can do to destroy her oh hallelujah could you imagine how the seventh messenger would stand there and he would watch now there's going to be a people there's going to be a people that's built to live in that land he would come behind the rapture and preach things that are to be and he would talk about your homeland he would talk about where you're going hallelujah could you imagine this morning what it was like for him to stand on the other side of the curtain of time and see multitudes of multitudes of coming they said those are your people those are all branham's oh no those are your converts down on earth you remember that lady no i don't remember her she was 90 years old when you let her to the lord and there she stood in an 18 year old body oh hallelujah could you imagine how he felt when he looked over there and he didn't just see some people but he seen you [Applause] you were seen marching onward christian soldiers marching as to war you heard a voice say get back in line get back in line get back in line hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah same life same token same power and she will be under her messenger a final voice to the final age we're not taken away from the messenger we're taking what the messenger said and we're running with what the messenger said we're preaching what the tapes say we're living what the tapes say [Applause] if you don't hear it from somebody else today let me tell you you're the final voice to the final age there's not another day coming you are her the voice of god is in you god still has a voice and deity lives on the inside of you your voice is his voice what would you be afraid to do who would you be who would you lay your hands on who would you lay your hands on you know what you would do you know what you got on your mind who would you pray for who would you call their name what condition would you pray for what condition would you lay hands on you're the final voice to the final age you can lay your hands upon cancer and cancer leave because you're his voice i watched as a young boy when my father fell off a 40-foot ladder i didn't literally watch him fall off of it but i watched him when he fell off of a ladder 40 foot straight on concrete fell and broke every vertebrae in his back doctors telling him he'd never walk again he'd never throw pitch with his boys anymore he'd never work he would be on disability all the days of his life but i'll watch as charlie spencer a son of god walk into that hospital room and lay his hands upon him and says tonight sister connie he's going to walk out of this hospital room without any help i watched as a son as he exercised his authority in the word of the lord and i watched a son by the name of ronald spencer walk out of that hospital room every vertebrae broke he defied what the doctor said who would you lay your hands on when my child and my charlie spencer when he was chimney sweeping with my father and his fingers were completely ripped off of his hand you remember the story they were ripped off of his hand and the doctor told my dad said now all we can do is make nubs out of those fingers my dad said doctor if you sow if you don't sew those fingers back on there and you just make nubs out of his hand you're gonna have an upset man when he wakes up he said but i'm a believer and i believe that if you'll sow those fingers back on that hand i believe god will make those fingers work again they said it won't be possible and those fingers started working a few weeks after the surgery was done who would you lay your hands on what condition would you pray for when a man that was sick stood in this pulpit after a fire coughing through a fire if he has he come and he would preach he would cough through sermons cough up things he would get so down in his lungs but he heard a voice he heard a voice he said where you're standing at why don't you go to praising him and an oxygen tent came over top of ron spencer and gave him a brand new set of lungs who would you pray for what would you say this morning i'd say there's nothing impossible to them that believe you're the final voice to the final age who would you pray for what would you ask what would you receive what door would you knock on this morning what miracle would you expect you're the final voice to the final age i'd done seen too much god and i've done heard his voice too much to turn away from this voice when he said when he said it's coming it's coming when he said prodigals would return they're returning when he said babies are coming babies are coming when he said life is coming life is coming when he says cancer is being destroyed cancer is being destroyed jesus is on his way this morning i want you to know church i heard a voice not even a year ago said that if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before the ministry of full gospel lighthouse has been used like never before because the people of god trusted what that voice said your pastor stood

wedding it was nice for you to show up but she's only focused on one man but one of my favorite things to do at a wedding some people would call it a funeral but i call it a wedding my favorite thing
