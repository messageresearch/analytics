[48:09] more precious than of gold that

[48:43] we're so thankful father to be gathered
[48:45] together in your name
[48:47] if we were gathered under the name of a
[48:49] church it wouldn't mean much
[48:51] but were gathered together in the name
[48:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ a name that is
[48:57] higher than every name a name that has
[48:59] been exalted above all the prophets of
[49:02] all the kings you are the king of kings

[49:42] your mind I want to remind you of Who
[49:45] You Are
[49:46] the whole world is God's
[49:49] the heaven
[49:51] the heavens of heavens
[49:53] is the Lord's
[49:55] and he reigneth Among The Children of
[49:57] Men
[50:00] but of those who he hath chosen
[50:03] whom he hath purchased to himself
[50:06] he saith what he's saith not of others
[50:12] but he calls you my people
[50:16] won't you say that there I am his people
[50:20] in this word
[50:22] it is an idea a proprietorship
[50:26] he owns us in a special manner the
[50:30] Lord's portion is his people
[50:34] Jacob is the lot of his inheritance
[50:39] all the nations upon the Earth are his
[50:42] the whole world is in his power
[50:45] yet are his people his chosen more
[50:49] especially his possession for he hath
[50:52] done more for them than others I love
[50:56] that don't you
[50:57] he has brought he has bought them with
[51:01] his blood
[51:02] he has brought them not to himself he
[51:06] has set his great heart upon them he has
[51:09] loved them with an everlasting love a
[51:13] love which hath Waters that cannot be
[51:15] quenched which hath Revolutions of time
[51:19] and never to suffice in the least degree
[51:24] his love will never diminish
[51:28] that's how much he loves you just in
[51:31] case the enemy told you this morning
[51:33] you're nothing why don't you remind your
[51:35] enemy I'm God's chosen people
[51:42] I wrote this to my family yesterday and
[51:44] I'll share it since you're my family
[51:46] I'll share it with you
[51:48] as the Lord would lay these words upon
[51:50] my heart and I'll read the text again
[51:52] that the trial of your faith
[51:55] being much more precious than of gold
[51:58] that perisheth though it be tried with
[52:01] fire
[52:02] might be found under the praise and the
[52:04] honor and the glory of the appearing of
[52:06] the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:08] Psalms 23 and verse 4 yea though I walk
[52:11] through the valley of the shadow of
[52:13] death I will fear no evil
[52:16] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[52:18] staff they comfort me
[52:20] thou preparest a table before me in the
[52:23] presence of my enemies thou anointest my
[52:26] head with all in my cup runneth over
[52:28] James chapter 1 and verse 12 blessed is
[52:31] the man
[52:33] that endureth Temptation for when he is
[52:36] tried he shall receive the Crown of Life
[52:39] which the Lord has promised to them that
[52:43] love him
[52:45] let no man say what he is tempted I am
[52:48] tempted of God for God cannot do be
[52:51] tempted with evil neither tempteth he
[52:54] any man
[52:56] my thoughts for the that yesterday as I
[53:00] awake
[53:01] Satan went before my God and said
[53:05] Ron will turn and run In the Heat of the
[53:09] trial
[53:11] and God thought
[53:14] I have confidence in the seed that's on
[53:16] the inside of him
[53:18] I know it because I placed it there
[53:22] [Music]
[53:24] have at it
[53:28] have at it was God's response
[53:32] so here we are three years later as I
[53:34] awake again to take chemo for the day
[53:38] good days bad days feeling like the flu
[53:41] has taken over my body every day
[53:44] run no
[53:48] because every day is a miracle
[53:51] let's enjoy every day that we live
[53:54] God is greater than every problem that
[53:58] we have
[54:01] we shall not whine we shall not complain
[54:04] or become a slave to cancer
[54:07] or any problem that we have
[54:11] we shall come forth as gold we shall
[54:16] live in Victory I declare to you today
[54:19] as a victory
[54:25] Hallelujah
[54:28] with Jesus on our side we shall not lose
[54:33] I love you all I say this to all of you
[54:35] I love you all
[54:37] never take a moment for granted
[54:42] sometimes we get and I'll just add this
[54:44] sometimes we get to the point to think
[54:45] well this is the way it's always going
[54:47] to be
[54:50] and we've we've kind of came to church
[54:52] and we think well brother Ron and
[54:53] brother Andrew and these guys are going
[54:55] to always be here when we don't realize
[54:57] that next week could be different
[55:01] are you with me one bad day can change
[55:04] the whole scene of things
[55:06] so every day should be enjoyed
[55:11] you say we're brother Ron but you don't
[55:12] know my troubles if you quit whining and
[55:15] look up
[55:17] if you'll just stop your whining and
[55:19] look up and quit complaining just enough
[55:21] to you can get some victory
[55:27] before you can have a trial
[55:30] now just think about this before you can
[55:33] have a trial
[55:36] the enemy has wept before the father
[55:41] and said I I can't get to him
[55:45] I can't touch a hair of his head will
[55:48] you give me permission
[55:53] will you give me permission
[55:57] to get into where he's at
[56:00] that's how protected that you are a seed
[56:03] of God
[56:05] and before God gives the devil
[56:08] permission
[56:09] to put you in a trial he has confidence
[56:13] in you that you'll make it through it
[56:18] that's quite a statement but it's the
[56:20] truth
[56:21] Satan can't touch a hair of your head
[56:28] he can't touch a hair of your head
[56:31] until God has given permission to do it
[56:36] Hallelujah you love the Lord isn't he
[56:38] good the scripture said they shall lay
[56:41] hands on the sick
[56:43] and they shall recover are you with me
[56:47] the scripture tells us that these signs
[56:49] shall follow them that believe
[56:52] in my name you'll cast out devils
[56:56] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[56:59] they shall recover
[57:02] a Believer is one who acts on the word
[57:07] of God
[57:09] so in our trials
[57:11] we will act like Sons and Daughters of
[57:14] God
[57:19] I want you to get these first opening
[57:21] statements
[57:27] God never asked us to do something that
[57:29] he won't do his self
[57:33] are you with me he never asked us to do
[57:35] something he will not over ask you to do
[57:38] anything
[57:40] listen he won't put on anything on you
[57:43] that you can't bear
[57:46] you say brother Ron but I'm just feel
[57:48] like giving up good
[57:52] now you can let Jesus do something
[57:56] because when you give up you realize
[57:58] he's got a hope
[58:00] because you were to give up a long time
[58:03] ago
[58:06] you didn't give up a long time ago had
[58:09] it not been for God holding on to your
[58:11] hands
[58:14] God asked Lord to build an ark
[58:17] because God was going to flood the Earth
[58:23] Moses stretched out a rot
[58:26] and then God parted the waters
[58:30] Joshua marched around the walls of
[58:33] Jericho
[58:35] and God pushed them down
[58:38] Elijah smote the waters and God parted
[58:42] them
[58:43] God will do his part
[58:46] whether on but God feels like a million
[58:48] miles away you don't know what he's
[58:50] carrying you
[58:54] Alaska threw a stick in the river and
[58:58] God made Iron to swim
[59:00] Naaman dipped in the water seven times
[59:03] and then God healed him of leprosy
[59:09] Jesus said lay hands on the sick
[59:12] it is God that will heal them
[59:15] no man heals nobody we just take God at
[59:19] his work
[59:22] we simply take God in his word and God
[59:26] will do his work
[59:27] don't you worry the sun will come up
[59:30] tomorrow
[59:31] the moon will come up tonight
[59:35] it's a promise of God are you with me
[59:38] now
[59:41] brother on the whole world's dependent
[59:42] on me oh no look in the mirror
[59:46] you can't hardly depend on yourself
[59:50] the oxygen that you just breathed when
[59:53] it goes out of your nostril says Jehovah
[59:55] God
[59:58] so even the greatest atheists in the
[1:00:00] world just by breathing
[1:00:03] they breathe the Breath of God
[1:00:06] we couldn't do anything without God
[1:00:13] Amen brother Ron but I'm an atheist get
[1:00:15] ready to die
[1:00:16] in your moments when you realize that
[1:00:19] the wrong one is opening the door you
[1:00:21] wish you had Jesus
[1:00:25] many have said it there are no atheists
[1:00:28] in a foxhole
[1:00:32] when you realize that hell is real
[1:00:36] just look up famous last words
[1:00:39] it's an easy lookup go to Google famous
[1:00:42] last words
[1:00:45] and you will find that people that did
[1:00:47] not believe in God in those last seconds
[1:00:51] begin to say hell is real
[1:00:54] listen we ought to know it's real
[1:00:55] because Jesus talked more about hell
[1:00:57] than he talked about heaven
[1:01:00] because he was here to save the world
[1:01:03] you don't have to go to hell
[1:01:05] you're lost today you don't have to go
[1:01:08] to hell God don't send you to hell
[1:01:13] say it with me God's not sending nobody
[1:01:16] to hell
[1:01:17] you gotta across the blood of
[1:01:20] Jesus Christ your salvation is paid for
[1:01:26] Give the Lord a great big hand right
[1:01:28] there
[1:01:35] Proverbs chapter 3 sister Linda your
[1:01:38] favorite scriptures trust in the Lord
[1:01:40] with all thine heart and lean not to
[1:01:43] thine own understanding
[1:01:45] and all thy ways acknowledge Him and He
[1:01:47] will direct thy path be not wise and
[1:01:50] though not thine own eyes and fear the
[1:01:52] lord and depart from evil it shall be
[1:01:55] held to thy navel and Morrow to thy
[1:01:57] bones honor the Lord with thy substance
[1:02:00] and with the first fruit of all thine
[1:02:02] increase
[1:02:03] so shall thy barns be filled with plenty
[1:02:06] and thy process shall burst out new wine
[1:02:09] my son despise not the chastening of the
[1:02:12] Lord neither be weary of his correction
[1:02:15] for whom the Lord loveth he correcteth
[1:02:18] aren't you glad of that
[1:02:19] even as the Father the Son in whom he
[1:02:22] delighteth happiest the man that findeth
[1:02:25] wisdom and the man that giveth
[1:02:27] understanding
[1:02:30] brother on but I'm in a trial I want you
[1:02:32] to understand your trial is not the goal
[1:02:37] cancer Is Not Gold that I'm fighting
[1:02:40] Abraham was asked by God
[1:02:44] after 25 years of waiting on the promise
[1:02:47] to be fulfilled
[1:02:49] listen his trial was not leaving him
[1:02:54] his trial was not not enough grass his
[1:02:59] trial was not I'm too rich or I'm too
[1:03:01] poor or I've got too many people with me
[1:03:04] his trial was not Sarah and Hagar having
[1:03:07] issues all the time his trial was not
[1:03:10] Ishmael
[1:03:13] but his greatest trial was when God
[1:03:16] asked him to do something that he was
[1:03:18] going to do himself
[1:03:21] take thy son thy only son
[1:03:27] take thy son thine only son up to the
[1:03:30] Mount Moriah
[1:03:32] up to where Jehovah Jireh was going to
[1:03:35] meet him and offer him as a sacrifice
[1:03:40] don't tell Sarah don't tell the others
[1:03:45] no doubt as Isaac asked him we have the
[1:03:48] wood we have the fire but we don't have
[1:03:50] a sacrifice and then
[1:03:54] the trial of your faith
[1:03:58] the trial of your faith was now get
[1:04:01] ready to put on
[1:04:04] Abraham had to have faith
[1:04:08] God gave him to me and I was a dead man
[1:04:11] and I could not have him
[1:04:15] and if I If I sacrifice him before the
[1:04:19] Lord
[1:04:20] God that gave him to me when I was dead
[1:04:23] will raise him back to life
[1:04:27] the faith was in the resurrection
[1:04:33] it wasn't in his wine and it wasn't I'm
[1:04:36] going to have to take my son up
[1:04:38] it wasn't in all them having all my
[1:04:40] trouble with a lot and I'm having all my
[1:04:42] trouble listen that's just life
[1:04:46] brother Ron but I'm having so much
[1:04:47] trouble it's called l-i-f-e
[1:04:52] right
[1:04:53] and we're all living life

[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:56] Joseph was in prison for quite a long
[1:05:58] time
[1:06:00] but his faith was in division
[1:06:03] his faith was in the dream
[1:06:09] he could pity party about what his
[1:06:11] brothers did to him but it was a part of
[1:06:12] getting him where he had to get
[1:06:15] are you with me they could tell he's
[1:06:18] dead they could they could show a bloody
[1:06:20] coat
[1:06:21] it was all part of the story
[1:06:24] but the dream the vision was what he had
[1:06:28] faith in
[1:06:30] living in prison was a tough thing
[1:06:33] being lied on was a tough thing but he
[1:06:36] didn't have faith his trial was not
[1:06:39] being in prison
[1:06:42] come on Church
[1:06:43] the trial of his faith was hanging on to
[1:06:46] the dream
[1:06:50] I want to ask you through all of your
[1:06:52] ups and downs
[1:06:54] is your faith in the promise
[1:07:02] brother on my friend died

[1:07:25] life that will get you to where you need
[1:07:28] to go

[1:07:34] and then what will come forth is pure
[1:07:36] goal at the end of the day
[1:07:39] [Applause]
[1:07:40] the resurrection will bring you back to
[1:07:42] life
[1:07:47] oh ain't it good
[1:07:50] brother Brandon said when when I once
[1:07:52] was in his presence
[1:07:55] and I realized that there was somebody
[1:07:57] who loved me
[1:08:00] he loved the unlovable
[1:08:04] there was somebody that loved me when
[1:08:07] nobody else loved me
[1:08:11] there was somebody who cared for me
[1:08:14] no one else
[1:08:16] cared for me you ever have the devil
[1:08:19] tell you that nobody loves you
[1:08:23] am I the only person in the room
[1:08:27] he whispers in your ear nobody loves you
[1:08:30] nobody cares for you I walk out of
[1:08:34] church sometimes and they go
[1:08:36] what a flop that was
[1:08:38] and the enemy's just in my ear boy you
[1:08:40] flopped
[1:08:43] you studied for a couple of weeks and
[1:08:45] you absolutely flopped and it's then I
[1:08:48] realized that that's probably when it
[1:08:49] was at the best
[1:08:51] [Applause]
[1:09:03] you ever sit in church and the enemy
[1:09:05] battled in your mind the whole time
[1:09:09] why we must be in the right crowd here
[1:09:11] battled in your mind the whole and then
[1:09:13] next week all the sudden sentences from
[1:09:15] these sermons come back in your ear
[1:09:19] so all the enemy did for an hour and a
[1:09:21] half trying to battle you while the
[1:09:23] preacher was going for it you're so
[1:09:25] quiet
[1:09:27] you're so caught it and God reminds you
[1:09:30] over and over and over again of what
[1:09:35] the stupid devil loses again
[1:09:38] [Applause]

[1:16:57] yet in the end you always bring us out

[1:17:08] and we're saturated with your goodness
[1:17:11] Romans chapter 4 and verse 17.
[1:17:17] as it was written
[1:17:20] I have made thee a father of many
[1:17:22] nations
[1:17:23] this is before he ever had a child
[1:17:26] God said I have made you a father of
[1:17:29] many nations
[1:17:31] before him who believed even God who
[1:17:35] quickeneth the dead calleth those things
[1:17:38] Rich be not as though they were
[1:17:41] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:17:44] he might become the father of many
[1:17:47] nations
[1:17:48] according to that which was spoken so
[1:17:51] shall thy seed be
[1:17:53] and being not weak in faith he
[1:17:55] considered not his own body now dead
[1:17:57] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:18:00] neither yet the Badness of Sarah's womb
[1:18:03] notice these words he staggered not at
[1:18:07] the promise of God through unbelief
[1:18:11] but was strong in faith given glory to
[1:18:14] God I love this next verse and being
[1:18:17] fully persuaded
[1:18:22] that what he had promised
[1:18:27] he was able also to perform
[1:18:33] passion translation Against All Odds
[1:18:36] when it looked hopeless Abraham believed
[1:18:38] the promise and expected God to fulfill
[1:18:41] it
[1:18:42] listen Abraham couldn't do it
[1:18:46] so God had to do it
[1:18:48] you and I can't produce Resurrection so
[1:18:52] God I have to do it we can't produce
[1:18:54] Rapture so God will have to do it
[1:18:59] some of the trials you go through you
[1:19:01] can't get through without God holding
[1:19:04] your hand
[1:19:06] I love that song I can't even walk
[1:19:09] without you holding mine
[1:19:14] Abraham believed the promise of God and
[1:19:16] expected God to fulfill it
[1:19:18] he took God at his word and as a result
[1:19:21] he became the father of many nations
[1:19:23] God's declaration over him to come to
[1:19:26] pass that your descendants
[1:19:29] will be so many
[1:19:31] they will be impossible to count
[1:19:37] can you imagine him sitting on the well
[1:19:39] maybe at the Gate of the city and he's
[1:19:43] childless and he looks over at his
[1:19:45] buddies and he said my descendants are
[1:19:48] going to be so many it'll be impossible
[1:19:51] to count
[1:19:54] can you imagine the neighbors going home
[1:19:56] and telling their wife for supper
[1:19:58] because we talk about people
[1:20:06] I told the truth right there in church
[1:20:14] you talk about your teacher you talk
[1:20:15] about your friends you talk about your
[1:20:17] co-workers you talk
[1:20:18] it's what you do
[1:20:25] ain't that right
[1:20:27] hey they're right just go ahead and
[1:20:28] admit it let me have a hundred percent
[1:20:30] participation you know you do
[1:20:36] that's right good or bad
[1:20:41] we're hoping some of these new people
[1:20:42] come in they don't talk about people but
[1:20:44] we're going to talk about you
[1:20:50] but when you see him today you're going
[1:20:52] to realize we're a team here
[1:20:54] we got your back
[1:20:56] when nobody else had got your back we
[1:20:59] got your back
[1:21:00] [Applause]
[1:21:06] you know it's the truth you're you're in
[1:21:08] Louisiana but you know it's the truth
[1:21:11] y'all don't talk about coffee all the
[1:21:12] time you do not talk about coffee all
[1:21:15] the time
[1:21:17] so they go home and they go that crazy
[1:21:20] Abraham
[1:21:22] he you know he couldn't live with Abram
[1:21:24] now he's Abraham
[1:21:26] he thinks he's got God in his name
[1:21:30] and now he told me today I'm going to
[1:21:33] have so many kids
[1:21:35] and kids are going to have kids and kids
[1:21:37] are going to have kids
[1:21:40] I'm going to have so many descendants
[1:21:44] they're going to be impossible to count
[1:21:52] I switch some people at church the other
[1:21:54] day
[1:21:55] and you know they went to church and
[1:21:57] they came home and and do you believe
[1:21:59] that they think
[1:22:01] before Russia drops a bomb on us
[1:22:05] that they're going to leave
[1:22:09] and Los Angeles is going to drop beneath
[1:22:11] the ocean can you believe what they're
[1:22:14] talking about there
[1:22:16] and they're going to take their children
[1:22:17] that church is going to be empty except
[1:22:20] for a few
[1:22:23] and they're going to go in a Rapture in
[1:22:26] the moment in the twinkle of an eye some
[1:22:28] are going to be driving down the road
[1:22:30] some are going to be drinking coffee and
[1:22:32] they're going to evaporate
[1:22:34] [Music]
[1:22:35] yeah that's what I believe
[1:22:46] finish the quote in spite of being
[1:22:49] nearly 100 years old
[1:22:51] when he when the promise of having a son
[1:22:54] was made his faith was so strong
[1:22:58] that it could not undermine by the fact
[1:23:02] that he and Sarah was incapable
[1:23:07] of conceiving a child
[1:23:10] but he never stopped believing God
[1:23:17] he never stopped believing God
[1:23:21] God's promise for he was made strong in
[1:23:24] his faith
[1:23:25] to father a child and because he was
[1:23:28] mighty in faith and convinced that God
[1:23:32] had all the power needed to fulfill his
[1:23:35] own promises
[1:23:38] Abraham glorified
[1:23:44] trying to behave
[1:23:46] Revelations chapter 12 and verse 10. and
[1:23:50] I heard a loud voice and saying in
[1:23:53] heaven
[1:23:54] now is come salvation
[1:23:58] and strength and the kingdom of our God
[1:24:02] and the power of His Christ
[1:24:05] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[1:24:09] down
[1:24:10] which accused them before our God
[1:24:14] day and not
[1:24:16] now this is our part and they overcame
[1:24:19] him by the blood of the Lamb
[1:24:22] and the word of their testimony and they
[1:24:25] love not their lives unto death
[1:24:28] translation and then I heard a
[1:24:30] triumphant voice in heaven proclaiming
[1:24:32] now salvation and power are set in place
[1:24:35] and the kingdom reigneth of our God and
[1:24:38] the rule and authority of his anointed
[1:24:40] one are established for the accuser of
[1:24:43] our brothers and sisters are Relentless
[1:24:46] and accuse them before God day and not
[1:24:49] and now he has been defeated
[1:24:55] he has cast out once and for all
[1:25:01] I read that for the devil
[1:25:04] he might as well know his future
[1:25:07] and he might as well know who's whipping
[1:25:09] him
[1:25:15] Hallelujah
[1:25:17] found this to be an interesting quote
[1:25:22] we as human beings
[1:25:25] get impatient
[1:25:30] laughs some didn't hear it some did
[1:25:34] we as human beings
[1:25:37] get impatient
[1:25:42] how many has a Keurig coffee pot
[1:25:45] Curry
[1:25:46] you put the pot in the courage
[1:25:50] I'm sorry I'm going to tell you
[1:25:51] something you put the pod in the Couric
[1:25:55] you push the power button on
[1:25:58] and you flip it down and you pick which
[1:26:01] setting that you want
[1:26:03] eight ounces
[1:26:04] strong or hot and you stand there and
[1:26:08] you go
[1:26:19] you go feed the dog you go feed the cat
[1:26:21] you go
[1:26:24] because you can't wait 45 seconds
[1:26:30] it's got to heat up
[1:26:33] you're not over top of a of a hot fire
[1:26:35] with wood and you got a little screen
[1:26:38] there and you go down to the river and
[1:26:40] get you some water
[1:26:42] and you put some grounds of coffee I
[1:26:44] don't know how it worked you put some
[1:26:46] grounds of coffee and you cooked it for
[1:26:48] 30 minutes and you finally stood
[1:26:51] isn't that good
[1:26:53] you waited 45 seconds
[1:27:00] I know I'm talking to you I I can feel
[1:27:03] it
[1:27:07] we pray a prayer
[1:27:10] we pray I pray
[1:27:13] I'm recall to the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:27:16] and Jacob we're specific who we're
[1:27:18] talking to
[1:27:19] and we tell him what we want him to do
[1:27:22] we thank him for his goodness we thank
[1:27:25] you for his Mercy we thank him and Lord
[1:27:27] Lord Heal my tooth that has hurt me so
[1:27:31] bad or my earache or my toe that's
[1:27:33] hurting and we expect when the words
[1:27:36] fall of our mouth
[1:27:45] brother Ron but you're preaching the
[1:27:47] sermon and you're standing there with
[1:27:48] cancer raging in your body I want you to
[1:27:51] understand
[1:27:52] Satan would have doesn't kill me if he
[1:27:54] could have
[1:28:01] but since he hasn't had the ability to
[1:28:04] do it I can stand here and preach to you
[1:28:07] be patient with God
[1:28:20] sometimes God
[1:28:22] cannot answer spontaneously
[1:28:28] he said how many knows that
[1:28:30] Daniel Prayed
[1:28:34] and 21 days
[1:28:38] before the angel could get to him
[1:28:42] but he finally gets around
[1:28:45] so just leave it alone
[1:28:48] so many testimonies we could tell
[1:28:50] hundreds and hundreds of things that
[1:28:51] happened in a day
[1:28:56] Daniel was in trouble
[1:28:59] listen he was in trouble
[1:29:01] and God heard him
[1:29:04] the first time he asked
[1:29:08] but Satan held him up
[1:29:12] there was a war in the heavenlies
[1:29:16] that blocked the visitation
[1:29:21] but listen
[1:29:22] listen God don't he don't just say okay
[1:29:26] I'm not going to be able to answer that
[1:29:27] prayer he went and got reinforcements
[1:29:32] listen for your trial the calvary is
[1:29:37] coming
[1:29:42] it is
[1:29:49] [Laughter]
[1:29:53] Hallelujah
[1:29:56] any good
[1:29:58] so there was a place picked to where
[1:30:01] that Satan and God would battle in your
[1:30:03] flesh
[1:30:05] and they chose your mind
[1:30:08] yes it's right there
[1:30:12] they chose that is to be in the
[1:30:14] battlefield
[1:30:15] were the enemies would fight one another
[1:30:19] see Russia and America has chose a place
[1:30:22] called Ukraine to fight
[1:30:24] whether you really know it or not
[1:30:25] they've chose a place to fight so that's
[1:30:28] where they're testing everything out
[1:30:30] your polit your your media is telling
[1:30:33] you a whole different thing but they've
[1:30:34] chose a place where to fight
[1:30:36] they don't want to fight it to Kremlin
[1:30:37] they don't want to fight at Washington
[1:30:38] so they've chose a place to fight so God
[1:30:42] listen you don't have to believe that if
[1:30:44] you don't want to but it's the truth
[1:30:46] so God and the devil chose a place
[1:30:50] called your mind
[1:30:53] this is the place where the battle rages
[1:30:57] no matter if you've been a Believer for
[1:30:59] 50 years
[1:31:04] this is the place that it rages
[1:31:07] the other morning I woke up very early
[1:31:09] in the morning
[1:31:11] and this is this is why this sermon is
[1:31:14] being preached
[1:31:16] I felt so confused in my mind
[1:31:20] unbelief is trying to settle in my room
[1:31:22] and in my thoughts and I was so confused
[1:31:25] I I I just
[1:31:28] what's right's right what's wrong's
[1:31:30] wrong and I I was just I was just
[1:31:32] confused in my mind
[1:31:36] and I knew that wasn't the spirit of God
[1:31:39] I'm a Believer
[1:31:41] I believe this message with all my heart
[1:31:43] I've had phenomenal Supernatural
[1:31:45] experiences and here I'm battling in my
[1:31:49] mind
[1:31:50] I knew it wasn't medicine
[1:31:53] I knew that there was now a fight that
[1:31:56] was going on Connie was laying there
[1:31:58] asleep I I'm a I'm a fighting and I'm
[1:32:01] wrestling and I just decided hey I'm not
[1:32:05] going to bed with this going on
[1:32:08] and I began to go in and I start reading
[1:32:11] the Bible I start listening to a tape
[1:32:13] and I begin to I begin to just and it
[1:32:16] took about an hour for that Spirit to
[1:32:19] just break
[1:32:21] but when it did
[1:32:24] gold came out of it
[1:32:35] you're gonna have to wrestle at times
[1:32:41] you're going to have to fight at times
[1:32:44] you're going to have to believe when it
[1:32:46] seems unbelievable
[1:32:49] you're going to have to believe for the
[1:32:51] impossible
[1:32:53] but did not God open up the Red Sea
[1:32:57] did not God close the mouths of lions
[1:33:00] and allowed Daniel to be in the presence
[1:33:03] of God and walk out of the den did not
[1:33:08] God come and visit with three Hebrew
[1:33:11] children in the fire
[1:33:19] our champion of champions
[1:33:22] came to his ultimate test
[1:33:29] Jesus in every meeting was made fun of
[1:33:33] every meeting the devil was always there
[1:33:36] to question to make fun to criticize to
[1:33:40] scoff
[1:33:47] he got hungry
[1:33:50] had a headache
[1:33:54] foreign
[1:34:02] though he healed them all
[1:34:06] still the enemy Tried Him in every way
[1:34:09] that he could try
[1:34:11] the enemy came to him when he was 40
[1:34:13] days without food
[1:34:15] and he was wore out
[1:34:19] it just seemed like he
[1:34:22] as a man
[1:34:23] he was at the end of his strength
[1:34:28] and then the tempter came
[1:34:32] Jesus did not defeat him with his power
[1:34:36] he could have being who he was he could
[1:34:38] have defeated him
[1:34:40] but he took the word
[1:34:44] you can't defeat him
[1:34:47] with your personal strength
[1:34:53] but you take the word
[1:34:56] because the word came from God
[1:34:58] and the word whipped the devil every
[1:35:00] generation
[1:35:02] it'll do it in yours too
[1:35:06] brother Ron but I I sometimes just have
[1:35:09] so many feelings
[1:35:10] don't be confused by your feelings your
[1:35:13] feelings has nothing to do
[1:35:16] with overcoming
[1:35:19] somebody didn't shake your hand okay
[1:35:22] maybe they didn't see you
[1:35:26] somebody's in a you oh that person's in
[1:35:29] a bad mood Hey listen pray for him
[1:35:33] pray for them they need your prayers
[1:35:34] more at that point
[1:35:37] we're a team here we're a family here we
[1:35:39] don't Circle one off and cast them off
[1:35:41] we need every one of you
[1:35:43] nobody loves me you've just got the
[1:35:45] wrong feeling everybody in this building
[1:35:47] loves you
[1:35:50] well they forgot all about me
[1:35:52] listen you may be the one that
[1:35:54] everybody's praying for
[1:35:59] and Jesus Took the word and said it is
[1:36:01] written it is written it is written
[1:36:04] but his ultimate test was when they
[1:36:06] handed him across
[1:36:12] did he just stain it
[1:36:14] no
[1:36:16] when he come to the ultimate test
[1:36:20] he embraced it
[1:36:23] we don't have a picture of it today
[1:36:27] but there he stood with thorns all over
[1:36:29] his head
[1:36:30] his body was had strikes all over it
[1:36:34] blood was pouring down
[1:36:37] I can't say it vividly enough
[1:36:39] organs were showing through his back
[1:36:45] but when they placed that piece of wood
[1:36:47] on him
[1:36:49] rugged
[1:36:54] piece of wood
[1:36:56] it's a hard thing to see
[1:36:59] but he kissed it
[1:37:10] he embraced it
[1:37:15] this trial would get you
[1:37:22] when he healed the leopard it was one
[1:37:26] when the woman touched his garment it
[1:37:29] was one
[1:37:31] but this piece of wood
[1:37:34] would pay all the way from Adam
[1:37:37] till the last seed comes in
[1:37:52] I'll finish this two weeks from now
[1:37:54] but if you could only realize the trial
[1:37:58] that you're going through
[1:38:00] is bringing gold
[1:38:03] out of you
[1:38:10] your body
[1:38:12] probably some of us are forth more than
[1:38:14] others viral
[1:38:16] buy our build
[1:38:19] some are fluffier they know this
[1:38:24] but the average person is worth 84 cents
[1:38:28] think about that
[1:38:31] 84 cents
[1:38:33] if you go to Hardee's today or
[1:38:35] McDonald's today
[1:38:37] you're going to pay more than that for a
[1:38:39] kitty Burger
[1:38:42] and you're going to take that kitty
[1:38:44] burger and you're going to put it in
[1:38:46] here
[1:38:47] in that 84 cents because you're hungry
[1:38:53] but God's going to put you through fire
[1:38:56] and through trials
[1:38:58] because the great essay test says you're
[1:39:01] worth more than gold
[1:39:09] us guys are in the essay business
[1:39:12] we take things off your car
[1:39:15] we send it through smelters
[1:39:19] and we get the goody out of it
[1:39:23] sometimes there's not much goody
[1:39:25] but we get the goodie out of it
[1:39:28] what people call junk
[1:39:31] we call Treasures
[1:39:34] now you know what we do
[1:39:38] and when God looks down through time
[1:39:42] and he sees you
[1:39:44] you just sung about it
[1:39:48] and you know all the tests that you're
[1:39:49] even going through now
[1:39:52] but they're going to bring gold
[1:39:55] out of you
[1:39:57] let's stand to our feet this morning
[1:40:04] can I give you one more scripture
[1:40:11] none of us has had a day like job had
[1:40:17] we don't want to even start our book
[1:40:19] like that
[1:40:21] sister Doris you don't want to have a
[1:40:23] job day
[1:40:25] now Charlie may give you a fit but you
[1:40:27] do not want a job day
[1:40:30] messenger after messenger came and told
[1:40:33] him he'd lost this and he had lost that
[1:40:35] and he lost this and he lost that listen
[1:40:37] God didn't send him a letter
[1:40:40] before it all started and said if you
[1:40:42] can make it through this trial I'll give
[1:40:43] you a double
[1:40:48] he didn't get that
[1:40:53] but somewhere God had a testimony
[1:40:55] service with the Devil
[1:40:57] and the devil came up and he said
[1:41:01] you know if you take your hands off a
[1:41:03] job I'll cause him to lie
[1:41:06] tells him to turn around and hate you
[1:41:12] and so God gave him parameters to where
[1:41:14] he could work with
[1:41:17] friends turned on him even his wife
[1:41:19] turned on him
[1:41:23] sometimes you think you're all alone
[1:41:24] just think about Joe
[1:41:27] finally at the end of the day
[1:41:30] a lot of Trials went on
[1:41:32] God himself came to job
[1:41:36] and he began to talk to him
[1:41:38] he didn't talk to him about his problems
[1:41:40] he didn't talk about all of his losses
[1:41:43] as a matter of fact God didn't have a
[1:41:45] pity party with him
[1:41:47] God didn't talk about what was on Earth
[1:41:50] God talked about what was in heaven
[1:41:54] when we get to heaven we won't talk
[1:41:56] about our problems down here
[1:41:58] that's just going to be silly stuff
[1:42:03] and a quote of another great lady that's
[1:42:05] just going to be silly stuff
[1:42:10] he could just Elevate you

[1:42:14] to

[1:42:18] and the gates of pearl
[1:42:21] and there's going to be rivers of flow
[1:42:23] and water all the way down through the
[1:42:25] properties of of that great City while
[1:42:27] the city's 1500 miles wide and 1500
[1:42:30] miles high and it's going to be so
