Lord, how much you mean to us, Father, in the good times, [music] the bad times, Lord, you mean so much to us. Been praying all night for a pastor. And Lord, as he's reporting for duty, I I pray [music] God that each and every one of us would take the things of tomorrow, take the things that we got to do next week, Lord, and just cast it away from our mind. And Lord, may we pull from that gift. And may we pull, Lord, that the preaching will be easy. And Father, if we do the pulling, he'll do the preaching. [music] And you, Lord, you'll give the strength. Lord, bless him. We pray, [music] brother Matthew, Lord, as he's recovering. Father, how gracious and [music] merciful you are just to send compassion his way. And Father, you'll send compassion to each and every one [music] of us here. Sister Wanda, Lord, just been praying for them what their family's been going through. Lord, you're mindful of all these things. There's situations in this room right now that I believe, God, that you're working on. They may not know it, but Lord Jesus, I believe it. Father, have your way. I pray. If there's one in here, Lord Jesus, that's questioned the Holy Ghost. If they, Brother William preached on it, Lord, I just, it's such an anchor in my heart that [music] you got to have it. You got to have it. If you don't have it, you will not make it. Lord, we're not playing church no more. It's time to leave. It's time for a rapture. The bodies will get sick. They're going to get sick. But Father, one day these [music] bodies will have to obey your word. And I pray God, if there's one here, just just one. I just I'll ask for one, [music] but I want a bunch of them [snorts] that don't have the Holy Ghost. I pray that this is their day, that this is their time. Cuz Lord, they could be out in a world of confusion. They can be out in the world [music] without you, without hope. Lord, how sad a situation that would be. [snorts] But Father, come. Have your way in service. Bless all the efforts that's been [music] put forth. Bless Brother Andrew, the church, the ministers here, Brother William, Brother Matt. We thank you for them, Lord.

Sometimes they give you a heads up, sometimes they don't. Lord, we thank you. Empty and broken. I came back to him, a vessel unworthy, so sought by sin. But he did not despair. [music] He started over again. And I blessed the day. He didn't throw the clay away. Over [singing] and over he molds [music] me and makes me into his likeness. He fashions the clay. All a vessel [music] of honor I am today. All [singing] because Jesus didn't throw the clay away. [music] Oh, he is the potter and I [singing] am the clay molded [music] in his image. How he wants us [music] to stay. But when I stumble and I falter and my vessel breaks, he just picks up all the pieces. [music] He doesn't throw the clay away over [singing] and over. He [music] molds me and he makes me all into his likeness. He fashions all the clay. All a vessel of honor. All I am today. All because [music] Jesus doesn't throw the clay away. [music] Forgive me.

Oh, his face I'll see. Oh, now [singing] I might stop. Oh, and take the time just to look around me. [music] Lord, I see the signs of his appearing. Lord, it's everywhere. For [music] the things [singing] he said would come to pass. They're now [music] before us, Lord. And I feel the strange excitement in the air. Oh, next [singing and music] day now. But Lord is coming. Oh, [music] he'll be returning. Oh, for you and me, Lord. I've been watching, Lord. And I'll keep [music] on waiting for just any day. Now on his face I'll see.

Glad to have Matthew coming out of the hospital this morning and and uh Amen. First time I've seen him in that kind of pain and just glad that someone took the case and said, "We'll get you fixed." And [music] so that's what we pray for. Somebody will take our case. And &gt;&gt; I'm glad the Lord Jesus took mine. And &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] He's faithful. He's faithful. He's a great physician. Amen. God bless you. God bless you this morning. If you'll turn with me to Revelations chapter 19 and verse 6. Amen. Are you ready to have church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The most important place that we'll be all week long. And and we're just so we're so glad to be here. want to remember brother Jason Jackson literally just sent me a note just just a few moments ago. Brother Tim Mccomomas. Uh [snorts] he was due to have a a heart cath on the 17th, but they rushed him to the hospital last night and u most of us know brother Mike, brother Tim Mccomomas. He's been here with his dad and with brother Jason and so he's a big boy and uh probably 63, 6'4, something like that. and he's a big boy and uh probably one of the most fun people I've ever been around in my life and and so uh [clears throat] they took him to the hospital last night. A lot of chest pains. When they did the X-rays, they found masses all over his lungs. And so uh there's one actually one mass attached to his heart that's 4 in uh around. That's a huge tumor. And so if you'll just pray for him that God would just come on the scene for him in a special way. His family got a wonderful young family and be with him. I would say Tim is probably what do you think he's about 40 years old. Tim Mccomomas 45. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. So we're just wanting to remember him in prayer. I told brother Jason that we would be praying as a body. And uh we believe in miracles, don't we? &gt;&gt; Amen. And we've had some this week. Amen. Where's Brother Nathan at? He he here somewhere. There you are. That was a miracle, son. &gt;&gt; That was a miracle. And so, Amen. And my heart is so pleased that Sister Wanda ringing that bell. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Amen. And one day, Sister Wanda, I'll ring that bell and we'll dance. And so, amen. Looking forward to that day. Amen. For those that have fought cancer, they know it's a battle. It's an absolute war. And so, keep remembering us in prayer. It takes a lot of different corners and a lot of different journeys. And so, you just pray for us. Revelations chapter 19 verse 6. And this is about us. And I heard as if it was a voice of a great multitude, as the voice of a many waters, as the voice of a mighty thundering, saying, "Hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready." And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saint. And he said unto me, write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, for the these are the true sayings of God. Amen. You may be seated. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. I'd like to speak to you today on just a little thought on our pre our preparations to rule and reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to take you to the church age book, Revelations 20 11 and 15. Brother Brandham says this, and if you'll stay very attentive to this quote. And I saw a great white throne and and him that sat on it. From whose face the earth and the heavens fled away, and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. And the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works. And the sea gave up their dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. And this is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. And there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment. It says so. These righteous will not be the bride. For the bride sits with him in the judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, that makes you want to just shout right there. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthiansap 11 and 6 and 2 and 3, he said, "Do you not know that the saints shall judge the earth? And if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not that we shall judge angels? How much more things that pertain to this life? Revelations 3 and 21. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne. See, the bride is with him in the throne. &gt;&gt; See, the bride is with him in the throne and and she is to judge the world. She has to be sitting in the judgment with him. That is exactly what Daniel saw. Daniel 7 9 and 10. And I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did set whose garment was white as snow and the hair of the heads were were the like the pure wool. And his throne was like the fiery flame. and his wheels as a burning fire. A fiery stream issued and come forth from before him and thousands and thousands ministered unto him and 10 thousands times 10 thousands stood before him. The judgment was set and the books were open. And it is the same scene for the thousands of thousands who are ministering to him are the bride for the who ministers to her husband but the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I realize that I'm speaking to the bride of Jesus Christ. So I'm I'm going to be very careful with you this morning to let you know who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I also realize that for our preparation to sit with him on the throne, our preparation happens here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing magical that happens in the rapture or right after you die to where that you get a what you might say a nature change or even a character change. &gt;&gt; All of that happens in this life. We're here in this life where it's 10 years or 90 years and it is the molding of a character. &gt;&gt; We got to be molded. We got to go through test. &gt;&gt; You know when you become a Christian all of a sudden now you're going upstream. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember back in the day when you were living another life, &gt;&gt; alienated from the commonwealth of God, and it just seemed like you were going downstream. Sure, you had troubles. &gt;&gt; Sure, you had sorrows, but you were living under a different king. &gt;&gt; And that king was destroying your life, destroying who you were. Ain't it amazing once God begins to deal with your life and begins to turn now you have real purpose &gt;&gt; a real purpose to serve the Lord and now every enemy of hell turns against you &gt;&gt; didn't seem like that enemy was there when you were partying and you were doing all the things of the world &gt;&gt; but now it turns against you Right. &gt;&gt; I I did a um just a little little test last week. And I thought about I thought about every one of us have critics and enemies. All of us do. That's part of the molding process. I remember many years ago, brother Homer preached a sermon called beating a dead man. He said, "Now dead man laying in a casket, you can pinch him. You can cuss him. You can hit him right in the face. He won't flinch &gt;&gt; because he's a dead man. &gt;&gt; You can say anything you want to about him. He's a dead man. &gt;&gt; There he lays. He's in another dimension. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, let me just take a couple thoughts here just for a moment. You can beat Brother Brandham now. &gt;&gt; You can beat John Wesley now. Right. &gt;&gt; You can beat all of the patriots of the ages now because they're gone. &gt;&gt; The record is closed. &gt;&gt; It's over with. &gt;&gt; WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. &gt;&gt; What the critics don't know is they're wasting their energies. &gt;&gt; They're inspired from a dimension of the accuser of the brethren. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THEY'LL FIND THOUGHT. THEY'LL FIND FAULT AND LET ME let me just go through some cycles here. THEY'LL FIND FAULT with the messenger &gt;&gt; and they'll beat the messenger and they'll find all kind of their humanities &gt;&gt; and before long you know that wasn't enough to do. Then they will beat the preacher &gt;&gt; and you know that spirit won't quit. &gt;&gt; Then they'll beat this. &gt;&gt; That's right. How will they do that? 40 different writers inspired by God &gt;&gt; to write this holy word of God that you and I feast on every day. &gt;&gt; You see, the accuser of the brethren and his inspiration will never stop. SO WHEN YOU FIND A critic that is THAT IS CONSTANTLY HOUNDING THE MESSAGE, it's because they're inspired &gt;&gt; from the realm of hell. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S NO BOTTOM TO IT. &gt;&gt; Where did this sermon come from? I was sitting at brother Biscll's memorial getting ready to speak. I was speaking that with brother Tim Puit and one of the highest honors of my life to to speak one of my mentors. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Memorial brother Bisco meant an incredible amount to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He would say it over and over. There will come a time when my life's work will be sealed and I've done all that I can do for the kingdom of God. As I looked over that massive audience that day and and knowing the family and knowing the many of the people that had went to church there for decades, but there were some new faces there because brother Biscll was an incredible businessman. There was lawyers, businessmen sitting there. They only knew him by a business. They didn't know him by Pastor Ed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what really broke my heart was there was family there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I never met, sisters, extended family that had never heard a sermon that he preached. &gt;&gt; Amen. Today may be your first day and that might be kind of out of order, &gt;&gt; but all of us, all of us sitting here today have extended family &gt;&gt; that really don't know you. &gt;&gt; I just want to say it. They know you by an associate. They know you by business. I've been in business since I was 13 years old. I've got a lot of business associates. Some of them extremely successful. I've sat in their boardrooms and we've been a part of many people's lives, but they don't know me of that eternal realm. &gt;&gt; AND I THINK HOW CLOSE THAT PEOPLE CAN COME. &gt;&gt; And miss THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you. Eternity is what we're all looking for. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bisll was a community leader. He was a developer of a lot of land. Developed a lot of different things. I want to flip that just for a moment. And yet in his life, he had a lot of people jealous of him. They were jealous. Jealous of his being, jealous of his wealth, JEALOUS OF his position. &gt;&gt; They never did anything in life. &gt;&gt; Probably never won a soul to Christ. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? MANY OF YOUR CRITICS HAS NEVER done nothing for God. Come on. &gt;&gt; They may have wrote a blog or did a video, but they never did anything for God. &gt;&gt; LET'S JUST PUT IT HOW IT IS. BUT THEY'LL STAND AT THE judgment &gt;&gt; under the inspiration of the spirit of the accuser. &gt;&gt; Now, they may have been very wealthy in life. Let me preach. They may have attained a lot of a lot of be a millionaire, own a huge house and a and A CAR, BUT WHAT WOULD IT be like to stand before the judgment hall of God &gt;&gt; and you be sitting on &gt;&gt; IN JUDGMENT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND THEY SPENT A GREAT PORTION OF their life FIGHTING WHAT WAS really real. &gt;&gt; I would hate to think that I sat in this church for 20 years and missed it. Amen. &gt;&gt; I think how close that you can be &gt;&gt; to eternal life and miss it. &gt;&gt; Let me just SAY IT. THERE'S NOTHING more important. &gt;&gt; And I want to say it from the bottom of my heart this if this would be my last sermon to ever preach. THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT &gt;&gt; THAN SERVING GOD. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE ENTERTAINED. [applause] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE FOR A SOCIAL VISIT. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT HERE TO BE MOTIVATED AND UPLIFTED AND GO BACK IN THE WORLD and be the same thing. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HERE TO BE CHANGED AND TRANSFORMED BY THE POWER OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. &gt;&gt; The saints will ruin rain, &gt;&gt; but before they rule and reign, they're going to walk in HIS SPIRIT, WALK IN HIS LOVE, WALK IN HIS FORGIVENESS. WHERE ARE WE going to do that? Here. &gt;&gt; We're in training. &gt;&gt; Our present life is not just random or by chance. It is preparation to live in that kingdom. &gt;&gt; Now, let me just say to obtain forgiveness, you got to give forgiveness. Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I sat in the office one day with a young man and he said, "I don't forgive." He's very quick to tell me, "I hold grudges. Somebody does something to me, I'll never forgive him." AND I'D SIMPLY SAID THESE WORDS to him, "You can never be a Christian." And I say this young man was probably 40, 50 years old. You sit there with me. &gt;&gt; Why waste 40, 50 years if you can't learn the simple principle of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; You got to be able to forgive. &gt;&gt; Jesus's prayer was all about forgiveness. In Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10, notice these words. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands. That at that time ye were without Christ. Notice this. at that time being without Christ being an aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST SAY WITHOUT JESUS YOU GOT NO HOPE &gt;&gt; AND WITHOUT GOD in the world but now &gt;&gt; thank you Lord. But now IN CHRIST JESUS, YE HAVE YE WHO SOMETIMES WERE A FAR OFF are made nigh BY THE [screaming] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1 and verse 12, giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. who hath delivered us FROM THE POWER OF DARKNESS. THAT'S enough to shout about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sin. Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature by whom we are all are create things created that are in heaven that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. &gt;&gt; He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, who in all things he might have preeminence. Oh, I like that. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell. &gt;&gt; Notice these next words. And having made peace through the blood of the cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet hath he reconciled &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death to present you, notice these words, holy, &gt;&gt; unblamable, &gt;&gt; unreprovable. Notice these next words, brother Doug. THIS IS POWERFUL. IN HIS SIGHT. &gt;&gt; Not in anybody else's sight. &gt;&gt; In his sight. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHO WE GOT TO PLEASE. &gt;&gt; HIS SIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if you continue in the faith, grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which he hath heard, and which was preached to every creature, which is unto heaven. Wherefore I, Paul, and made a minister. Come here just a second. I need a little help. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; He's going to get me some Tylenol for those that are have inquiring minds. I I throwed up so much over the last week until I'm so sore in my abdomen. Maybe the Tylenol will help. &gt;&gt; But I'm still here. [applause] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Amen. Now we pray it works. I'm sorry. It's just life. &gt;&gt; Just life. Thank you, brother Bernardet. I sure love you, buddy. I want to just kind of turn just for a moment. Brother Brandham had a conversation beyond the curtain of time. And I want to bring negative and positive here. Think of of all of the negative that is on the internet about brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; And if you look long enough, there's negative about you. &gt;&gt; Now, I I want you to just watch this just for a moment. Brother Brandham has a conversation beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's already settled. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You're Well, brother Rhonda, we don't know if the message is right. Well, let me just give you some assurance right here this morning. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam is having a conversation in that realm &gt;&gt; that is more real than this realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then that voice was speaking from above me said, "You know it is written in the Bible that the prophets were gathered with their people." And I said, "Yes, I I remember that in the scriptures." And he said, "Well, well, this is when you will gather with your people." And I said, "Then they'll be real." And I can feel them. Oh yes. And I said, "But there's millions. There's millions. There's not that many Brandhams." &gt;&gt; Notice he's thinking earthly, too. &gt;&gt; And that voice said, "They're not Brandoms. &gt;&gt; Them is your converts. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the Lord and said, "Some of them women there that you think is so beautiful were better than 90 years old when you led them to the Lord." No wonder they're screaming, "OUR PRECIOUS BROTHER." &gt;&gt; And they screamed all at once, "IF YOU HADN'T WENT, we wouldn't be here." &gt;&gt; And I looked around. I thought, "I don't get it." And I said, "Where's Jesus?" &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE HIM SO BAD. And they said, "Now he's just a little higher." Right up that way. Someday he will come to you. &gt;&gt; Said, "You were sent to for a leader. And God will come. And when he'll do when he does, notice these words, he'll judge you according to what you taught them." first whether they go in or not, we'll go in according to your teaching. &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, I'm so glad I did." Did Paul, notice what he says. Did Paul, does he have to stand like this? DOES PETER HAVE TO STAND like this? Yes. AND I SAID, "THEN I PREACHED EVERY WORD THAT THEY PREACHED. [applause] [applause] I never divvied FROM IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. THEY BAPTIZED in the name of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND I DID TOO. &gt;&gt; Were they taught the baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST, I DID TOO. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THEY TAUGHT, I DID TOO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And the people screamed and said, "We know that. We know where we're going with you someday back to earth. Jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preached us. And then if you are accepted at that time which you will be [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; then you will present us to him as your trophies of your ministry. You will guide us to him and alto together we'll go back to the earth to live forever. [snorts] I want to give you a little secret, trade secret that I have. They they call it they got a mental condition that you are if you do this. If you get a book and if you read the last chapter before you read any of it, you're supposed to have a you're supposed to have a certain mental condition. Well, I've did that my whole life. So, what I'm doing to you is I'm reading you the last chapter. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, brother, I don't know if I'm going to make it or not." Did you just listen to what I said? Amen. &gt;&gt; We believe this message with all of our heart [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S ALREADY SAID YOU'LL BE ACCEPTED. [applause] &gt;&gt; QUIT STRUGGLING. FLY LIKE AN EAGLE. &gt;&gt; I thought when you sung that song, it couldn't have been more perfect. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRUGGLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STRIDE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, this comes from a favorite speech of mine. It is not the critic who counts, Teddy Roosevelt. It is not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena &gt;&gt; whose face is marred with dust and sweat and blood. who strives valiantly, who hes, who comes up short again and again because because there is no effort without error or shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great enthusiasm and great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause. WHO AT BEST knows in the end and triumph of a high achievement. And who at worst if he fails at least fails while do daring greatly and so that his place shall never be with those cold timid souls &gt;&gt; did neither know victory &gt;&gt; or defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Brother Tim Puit a few years ago preached a sermon. He preached a sermon on rewards. You haven't heard it, go listen to it. And so I'd like you to just gather some of our thoughts just for a moment. Brother Tim says we're going to give an account for our life. At the end of the day, we're going to give an account for our life. I cannot imagine spending your life attacking the prophet. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Attacking the church. &gt;&gt; Attacking the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, do you have anybody in mind? No. But I hope you don't put your shoes on fit this sermon. &gt;&gt; What do you really think you were doing, Mr. critic, when you were thinking about destroying the bride of Jesus Christ, did you stop and think about what spirit &gt;&gt; was driving you? &gt;&gt; We got a couple examples IN THE SCRIPTURE. PAUL SAID, "Deus &gt;&gt; has forsaken me." &gt;&gt; That's right. Think about the two men that stood before Moses throwed their rod down, &gt;&gt; ATTACKING THE PROPHET OF GOD, and Moses's rod ate their rod up. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to just think about this. The critic throwed their rod down. After today, THE CRITIC'S ROD WOULD BE A ROD IN MOSES'S HAND. &gt;&gt; The critics's portion would be a rod in Moses's hand. And he would STRETCH THAT ROD OUT OVER the sea. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD NEVER FORGETS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Somebody attacks you, REMEMBER THIS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ATTACK THEM BACK. &gt;&gt; They have went on eternal record &gt;&gt; and sealed their doom. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're just trying to protect Brother Brandham. Nope. Let me bring you up to date for a little while. I've been a historian for a long time. &gt;&gt; The same thing happened to Spurgeon. &gt;&gt; In his life, Spurgeon was known as one of the greatest preachers that ever lived. &gt;&gt; He built a cathedral, a cathedral to where that it would hold thousands of thousands of people. He spent incredible amount of time raising the funds that would build his huge tabernacle, still a spacious place that stands today. But his own school rejected him. Those rejectors would would turn not only on Spurgeon, but they would turn on his preachers. And then they would turn on the Bible itself. &gt;&gt; John Wesley, a man that was known for creating a movement called the new method. &gt;&gt; We would know him as a messenger of the church ages. His own church turned on him after all the incredible works. give you an idea. Tens of thousands of people would be slain in the spirit of God. His mother would be an incredible writer. His wife, listen, down through the ages, these kind of men that stood in this kind of statue HAD CRITICS THAT WOULD TURN on them. I want to just ask you one question. What if Spurgeon would walk back into the churches that followed him today. &gt;&gt; Wonder how that they would feel as virgin would take the pull pit today. &gt;&gt; And I'm only picking two because I'm going to I want to try to be as brief as I CAN. WHAT IF JOHN WESLEY WALKED INTO THE MODERN Methodist church today? &gt;&gt; A man that preached strict holiness. strict holiness OF WHAT THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST MUST DRESS LIKE, HOW SHE MUST CONDUCT HERSELF. WHAT IF HE WALKED INTO THE LARGEST METHODIST CHURCH TODAY THAT NOW HAS GENDER PROBLEMS, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; That now has changed the rules. &gt;&gt; Dress code is a million miles away. WOMEN PREACHERS ARE THERE. &gt;&gt; SODOM AND GOMORRAH HAS FILLED HER TABERNACLES. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; THE SERMON THAT JOHN WESLEY WOULD PREACH. &gt;&gt; I want to finish this thought here. But William Brham could come into our church. [applause] and churches like all over the world that are following this message under real godly men &gt;&gt; and take the pullpit &gt;&gt; and be unashamed OF THE AUDIENCE THAT SITS BEFORE HER. [applause] HALLELUJAH. Let's give the Lord a hand right there. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what makes you guys feel the way you do? Well, I just want to pick one quote if I can. He said, "WELL, YOU WERE SEPARATED from your first union by your spiritual death. Now you're born again or remarried again to the new spirit union." or of of not your natural life of the things of the world, but of eternal life. That germ that was in you at the beginning found you and now your old book is gone and your union, your old union, your name in your old has been transferred. And you say, "Well, do you mean to tell me that my old book, God put it in the sea of forgetfulness?" You now stand perfectly &gt;&gt; before God. &gt;&gt; And your name is now in a new book. Not the book of life, but the Lamb's &gt;&gt; book of life. &gt;&gt; That's enough to shout. your new life in the Lamb's Book OF LIFE. YOUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE, HALLELUJAH, where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold. You're not only forgiven. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT ONLY FORGIVEN, YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; AND JUSTIFIED IS AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT. YOU NEVER [screaming] DID it &gt;&gt; in the first place. [applause] Now I want to go to one of brother Frasier's favorite quotes. [snorts] some time ago crossed through Central America and there was a minister by the name of Daniel Greenfield. He went to sleep one night and he dreamed he dreamed he had died and he was taken up to the gates of paradise and when he knocked at the door the doorkeeper came and said, "Who are you? that desires to enter in these gates. He said, "I'm Daniel Greenfield. I am an American evangelist. Just a moment there. I will see if I can find that any record of you here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came back and he said, "There's no record of you here." Oh, there must be something wrong. Surely my record's there. No, there's no record here. What shall I do? There's only one thing that you can do if you wish to. You can appeal your case to the white throne of judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you wish to appeal your case, he said, "Well, if that's all I can do, I will do it." And he said he begin to move out through space and he seemed for some time that he traveled just in space. And after a while he come into it where he be to get light and lighter and lighter and light gotten. And slower he be to move and finally right in the center of this light he stopped. There was no certain place that it was coming from but just all around him extreme light. just many times together, more brighter than the sun. And he said he looked around and after a while the great deep voice said, "Who art thou that stands before my judgment?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'm Daniel Greenfield, the American evangelist. I came to the gates of paradise and I was asked to come here to your judgment seat to find if I could plead my case. And said a voice came back and said, "Very well, Daniel Greenfield, I will try you at my judgment seat. I have a law that you stand to be tried by." Daniel Greenfield, did you ever tell a a lie while you was on earth? I thought I had been a truthful man. But in the presence of that great light, I seen that there was many times that I that I had said things that just wasn't right. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Yes, Lord, I lied." &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel Greenfield, did you ever steal while you was on the earth? He began to say, 'If there's anything that I thought about, I'd been I'd been honest. But in the presence of that great lot, I seen there was many little shady deals that I had pulled. I said, 'Listen friends, you might think that you're all right now, &gt;&gt; but in the presence of that light, it'll be different. &gt;&gt; You might be a GOOD CHURCH MEMBER. YOU MIGHT HAVE GOOD DRESS. You might be a help to the poor. YOU MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT, BUT in the presence of that great light, that white throne judgment. And then a voice said, "Daniel Greenfield, was you perfect in your life?" And I said, "Oh no, Lord, I wasn't perfect." I believe that's where we would all answer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And said he was listening for great blast to come from somewhere and hear him say, "Depart from me." said his bones begin to come unjointed as he was there and he was trembling knowing that he would sink into a devil's hell in a few minutes to be there for eternity. And said while he was thinking about that and listened for a voice, he said, "I heard a voice behind me. It was the sweetest voice I ever heard in my life. It was sweeter than any mother's voice that I'd ever heard. And said, "When I turned, I I seen the sweetest face that I ever saw." And he put his arms around me &gt;&gt; and he said, "Father, that's true." Daniel Greenfield wasn't so perfect in his life that there's one thing that he did. When my glory was made known, Daniel Greenfield stood for me on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; And now I'LL STAND FOR HIM HERE. [applause] &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Mother man went back about 150 years and picked up a story about a pardon. The president was Abraham Lincoln and there was a young man that got got was in the war and he'd run in a really bad time and the penalty was death for running. But that man had a friend &gt;&gt; that understood the conditions of his running. &gt;&gt; You can't go no higher than the president of the United States. This man found his way into the presence of Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln wasn'tware that he had, you know, the best what you might say papers or stamp, but he simply wrote, "You're pardoned." and signed his name. and he took it to the authorities and he took it to this young man. And this YOUNG MAN SAID, "YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME." &gt;&gt; THIS COMES ON JUST SOME SIMPLE PAPER. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; IF IT WAS FROM THE PRESIDENT, it it have stationery. IT HAVE HIS name &gt;&gt; and it would be a seal on it. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm not GOING TO BE MADE FUN OF. &gt;&gt; This young man was that went and done all the work to get it was brokenhearted cuz he knew he'd been with the president. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; And he knew how much &gt;&gt; this paper means. &gt;&gt; I can say it to you. I know how much &gt;&gt; this sermon means. [applause] They put that boy to death. This young man pressed the case and the judgment came down. A a pardon &gt;&gt; is not a pardon &gt;&gt; unless it's accepted. as a pardon. &gt;&gt; I want to SAY THIS TO YOU. THIS MESSAGE HAS GOT A PARDON IN IT. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS FULL OF GRACE &gt;&gt; AND IT'S FULL of mercy. &gt;&gt; It's full of forgiveness. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU'VE GOT TO ACCEPT IT AS THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ACCEPT IT. YOUR LIFE MAY HAVE BEEN MISERABLE, &gt;&gt; BUT GOD REWRITES your life. &gt;&gt; Can you give me just a little bit longer? [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's a major difference between the Old Testament and the New. By the way, you have a Bible. One of you guys got a Bible. I want you to I want you to come to the Old Testament, Malachi, and the New Testament. I want you to hold your place right there. I want you to I want you to come stand beside me when you do that. [snorts] In the Old Testament, they were covered by blood of bulls and goats and covenants. &gt;&gt; It didn't change their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of honest things that are written here. &gt;&gt; And I want to go over some of them. Honest things. &gt;&gt; These people didn't have wings on backs. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God made them not only write the great things, but he made them write the negative. &gt;&gt; Can you stay there just a little bit? Abraham Abraham became a liar. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, I'm doing this with great grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he told the king said, "She's my sister." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She's my sister. &gt;&gt; How close that he came to not being able to fulfill &gt;&gt; the potential that God had in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; IF I COULD SUBTITLE THIS JUST FOR THE NEXT FEW MOMENTS. IN SPITE OF THE FLAW. THAT'S &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; GOD OVERRIDES THE FLAW IN YOUR LIFE BECAUSE HE'S GOT A PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; And you LOOK AT YOUR FLAW. YOU LOOK AT YOUR MISTAKES AND SAY, "I CAN NEVER WELL, STAY WITH ME THE next little bit. I want you to think about she's in a king's palace, heathen king's palace, and he has taken her to be his wife, and he's out there praying for before God. SARAH THAT GOD HAD CHANGED BACK YOUNG AGAIN. GOD HAD SET AT HIS TENT. &gt;&gt; GOD HAD SAT AT HIS TENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "THY SEED SHALL POSSESS THE GATES OF their enemy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because of a lie. &gt;&gt; How big was this lie? &gt;&gt; God don't intervene. She's going to be married to a heathen king. &gt;&gt; That's right. And everything God has told Abraham is now nulling &gt;&gt; God. That's right. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, we're in trouble if God don't intervene. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Moses writes the first five books of the Bible, including the Garden of Eden. Brother Ron, but brother Brandham made thoughts. I want you to stick with me. Before Moses meets the pillar of fire, he kills an Egyptian soldier. &gt;&gt; He was a murderer. Right. &gt;&gt; We don't have any better way to say it, but he was a murderer. &gt;&gt; Moses had an extremely high temper. &gt;&gt; David, who knows exactly how many chapters that David writes. We could go figure it up. He writes your psalms throughout the scriptures, the Old Testament. But folks, let me just say this to you. Because of adultery, &gt;&gt; because of adultery, &gt;&gt; because of adultery, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; as a king. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] He has his best friend who is a gentile &gt;&gt; who is fighting for the Jews, &gt;&gt; fighting for David. He has that man killed. &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip through something here for a minute for the sake of time and my energies. Titus, want you to come here. Come right here. Titus is about the age of Steven. Stephen being full of the Holy Ghost. Stephen has in phenomenal potential. &gt;&gt; Phenomenal potential. And Paul will live with it the rest of his life. Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Take your off. Now, God has a plan. Paul is going to write 14 books of your Bible. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO WRITE 14 BOOKS of your Bible. YOU TALKING ABOUT GRACE AND MERCY? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; You talking ABOUT GRACE AND MERCY. GOD COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS. &gt;&gt; GOD COULD HAVE STOPPED IT. BROTHER RAY, BUT HE WATCHES THIS YOUNG MAN AFTER HE'S PREACHED A PHENOMENAL SERMON. THAT'S &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BEFORE THAT COUNCIL, PAUL HOLDS HIS his coat in his hand. &gt;&gt; Steven's words were, "I see Jesus standing. [sighs and snorts] &gt;&gt; I see Jesus standing." Paul will will spend the rest of his life thinking about holding that coat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; All but Paul and I could have I've got about a hundred more there. &gt;&gt; All but Paul's in the Old Testament. Did God throw him away? AMEN. &gt;&gt; DID GOD DESTROY THEM? &gt;&gt; They'll be there for eternity. &gt;&gt; But let ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT TIME AND ETERNITY. &gt;&gt; From this book to this book, &gt;&gt; come on. [snorts] &gt;&gt; FROM THIS BOOK, THE OLD TESTAMENT TO THE NEW TESTAMENT, &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS WASHES ALL OF THAT AWAY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; WASHES it all. Washes it all. That's just men. Sarah, won't you stand and be Tamar? You've heard about the lion of the tribe of Judah, &gt;&gt; the lineage that would come down, &gt;&gt; and if her husband won't have seed by her, that lineage will stop. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That lineage will stop. That family, those sons refuse to have a child by you. &gt;&gt; IT'S HINGING JESUS CHRIST NATURAL LINEAGE IS HINGING ON YOUR TESTIMONY. &gt;&gt; It's hinging on your testimony. &gt;&gt; She knowing THE WORD AND REVEAL THAT REVELATION OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DRESSES AS A HARLOT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HER FATHER-IN-LAW COMES THROUGH, SHE DRESSES A HARLOT AND BRINGS HIM IN. &gt;&gt; And he places his seed in her womb. And for payment, she took his staff and things that belong to him. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so when he came back through and sent men back through, they said, "Find me the harlot." There was no harlot there. &gt;&gt; We don't have a harlot here. And then they found out that she was pregnant. SO THEY BROUGHT THE LAW UP. &gt;&gt; They brought THE LAW UP THAT SHE SHOULD BE STONED. &gt;&gt; That's right. And she came before her father-in-law and she told him what her revelation was. The seed had TO PASS THROUGH HER WOMB. &gt;&gt; And the man whose child it is belongs to these signets. &gt;&gt; Notice his word said, "You're more righteous than I am. Thank you, Sister Sarah. &gt;&gt; For eternity shall be known. &gt;&gt; What about Rahab? &gt;&gt; What about Esther? &gt;&gt; What about Abidel? That was David's wife, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; All of THESE PEOPLE ARE SO IMPORTANT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD WATCHED OVER THEIR LIFE. [snorts] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SEED THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, HOW IMPORTANT AM I TO GOD? THE SEED. &gt;&gt; IT'S not your flesh. It's the seed that he deposited &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. HE PLACED A PART OF HIMSELF. [snorts] 1 Corinthians chapter 6. Do you know that the saints shall judge the world? Know ye not that ye shall judge angels? How much more things pertain to this life? The testing ground is here. &gt;&gt; Can I give you one more test? &gt;&gt; You know the lady that grabbed a tambourine and danced? That was a victory that day, right? &gt;&gt; Can you imagine 600,000 women dancing and what a dust storm that was? &gt;&gt; Their their enemy was floating &gt;&gt; and dead. &gt;&gt; But she had a spot in her life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take the time to read it to you, but Marram Mariam came before Moses &gt;&gt; and she began to say these words. You think you're the only holy man? &gt;&gt; She had forgotten that he was more than her brother. &gt;&gt; She had forgotten he was more than just another man. HE WAS A PROPHET OF GOD. &gt;&gt; And the BIBLE SAYS, "TOUCH MY NIGHT ANOINTING AND DO MY PROPHETS no harm." &gt;&gt; When you go to looking at flesh and making mistakes, &gt;&gt; you get in trouble. When she rebuked Moses, it kindled the anger of God &gt;&gt; in so much that leprosy immediately struck her. Brother Ron, I don't see my critics getting nothing. I don't see them being retributed anything. You're looking at a clock, whether it's Timeox, Timex, or Bulliva. And God don't operate with this. &gt;&gt; My My critics just seem to get by with it. He don't operate with this. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it ain't your job to fight back. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God takes your case. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God gave us an example here. She was struck with leprosy immediately. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It kindled the anger of God. &gt;&gt; The camp of Israel did not move until this situation was settled. And they cast her out from the camp for seven days. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; And it didn't move till she came back. Can you imagine what a lesson that was? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to just take just a couple more moments. Can you imagine the lessons in that home? &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't you touch God's anointing. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, you leave that message alone. You may not agree with it, but you leave that alone. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do, don't don't you come against Are you with me now? [applause] &gt;&gt; So, I told you last night, last weekend, how irritated we would be and do get when people attacked the prophet of the age. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, this is our our message. &gt;&gt; When people see things against the prophet of God, it irritates you, makes you sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, it's your turn again. Brother Shannon, could you stand for me? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham's dead. Paul's dead. Peter's dead. Brother Frasier's dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to kind of make a frame right there. Yeah. So, we've got a picture of Shannon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We got a picture of Shannon. And I'm sure you got some critics because I've heard you tell me that people you work with. But what they don't realize, they're picking on a dead man. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; It will do them no good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's sealed. &gt;&gt; It's settled. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's come to a spot to where their words has no effect &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY, "I'M ONE OF THOSE converts that say, I'm resting on the message and it's already accepted. &gt;&gt; I'm just living out time." [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay. I need a chair. Thank you. All right, here you go. Well, since you brought it, won't you see it sitting here? [laughter] Can you bring me that picture off the wall? &gt;&gt; I don't know how it's attached, but if we put it there, it can always come down. All right, I'm going to turn this just now. Not You can just hang right here with me. Okay, I'll let you do this, John. So, Brother Andrew, I know 100% you got crickets. So when people attack you, they really don't know what they're attacking &gt;&gt; because you're also a dead man. And we heard about Daniel Greenfield. As he stood for me on earth, I'll stand for him in heaven. &gt;&gt; So I want to give you an illustration. When people are talking about you, what they're really doing, &gt;&gt; they're think they're attacking Andrew. &gt;&gt; Man, my heart's going 100 miles an hour right now. Will you turn the picture? [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] Somebody take a picture of that. Somebody take a picture of that. I don't know. I know every one of you got a phone. So when you hear somebody attack Andrew, somehow you get a hold of this picture &gt;&gt; and you tell them this is actually who you're attacking. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's just your son. Okay, Carson, come here. &gt;&gt; Brother Andrew, I'm gonna need your seat. cursing God's dealing with you. You know that you'd make an incredible prog golfer. But God's got bigger plans than being a pro golfer. And I know you have critics even now. But why don't why don't you turn the picture around? [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Scripture says, "To him that overcometh &gt;&gt; will I grant to sit with me in my throne." I know you have trials and you have tests. I'm not deaf and dumb. &gt;&gt; I know you do. But if I can say these words to you, it'll be worth it. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it after all. &gt;&gt; It'll be worth it. When we're sitting there that day, I don't know quite how it's all going to be arranged. And we don't have to sit in the judgment to not have to walk up before those angry eyes to sit with him and it's already sealed. &gt;&gt; There'll be no question about eternal life. It's already sealed. It's already done. [sighs] It'll be worth it after all. &gt;&gt; After all, I'm not done. I'm just going to quit. I love you with all my heart. &gt;&gt; I love you. [applause] Could [applause] we stand? Maybe you don't know him today. Maybe you don't know him. You don't have to wait another day. &gt;&gt; That's right. You don't have to wait another day. There's nothing in this world worth staying here for. &gt;&gt; I want to be a Christian. Don't you? &gt;&gt; Maybe you say, "Brother Ron, I I've been sitting on the fence, maybe not making a full commitment, maybe every eye closed just for a moment, and you'd like to say, "Brother Ron, would you pray for me? Just pray for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, my heart feels like it's busted. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.

I I thought this is one of the most powerful songs that's [music] ever been written. Well, the original word says, "I was seated right where I don't belong." And I thought, there's something something wrong with that song. [music] And I just took that one word out of there, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because to a lot of people, you shouldn't be sitting at the table. and according to your [music] choice and your decisions and the things in your life, you shouldn't be sitting at the table. But because God's election, he said, you're seated right where you belong at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get here on your own. You didn't get carried to the table by your own self.

She [music] stumbles through the tears that [singing] made her blind. She felt [singing] such [music] pain. Some spoken anger. [singing and music] Heard folks whisper there's no place for her [music and singing] kind. Still on she came through the [singing] shame that fleshed [music] her face until at last she knelt before his feet. [music and singing] Even [music] though she spoke no [singing] words, &gt;&gt; everything she [music] said was heard as she poured her love for the master from her box of alabaster. I've [singing] come to pour my praise on [music and singing] him like oil from Mary [music] alabaster box. Don't [music and singing] be angry if I wash his feet with my tears. And I draw them with [music and singing] my hair. [music] You were there. The night [singing] he found me. You did not [music and singing] feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms [singing] around me. You don't know the [music] cost of the oil [singing] in my alabaster [music] box. I [music] can't forget the way [singing] life used to be. I was a prisoner to the [music] sin that had me bound. [singing] I [music] spent [singing] my days pour my life without measure into a little [music and singing] treure box I thought I found [singing] [music] until [singing] the day Jesus came to me and heal my soul with the wonders [music and singing] of his love. &gt;&gt; So [singing and music] now I'm giving back to him. All the [music and singing] praise he's worthy of. I've been forgiven [singing] and that's [music] why I love [singing] him so much. &gt;&gt; Lighthouse. I've come [singing] to pour my praise on him [music] like coyo [singing] from Mary's alabaster [singing] box.

I walked down [singing] that hill alone with a pocket full of river stones. But what the Philistine couldn't see is what I have was [music and singing] more than see on my own. I'm weak. But my God fights for me. [music] I will serve to the king interpreting his crazy [music] dreams. I won't worship mortal men. So they threw me in a lion's [music and singing] den. Vicious teeth were all I saw. Just some [music] came and shut their jaws. You couldn't find a scratch on me. In fact, that night I fell asleep. When morning came, it shocked [music] them all. Cuz my God [screaming] hides for me. [music] [singing] Oh yes, he does. I stumbled into it to the roof with alabaster and [music] my wounds. I could feel their [singing] judging eyes as I knelt before the cry. I poured my oil upon his feet. I didn't care who saw me. [music] I gave him all I had that day. [singing] And he should have sent me [music] on my way. But instead, he lifted up my head. Cuz my [music] God [singing] fights for me. He's my shield. [music] He's my strength. [singing] The [music] victory is [singing] the Lord. He's [music] my shield. He's my sword. Oh, victory. [music] [singing] He's my shield. He's my shield. [singing] He's my [music] sword.
