[42:29] you may be seated just and and I I said
[42:32] I'm not going to keep you all night but
[42:34] uh Hallelujah I'd love to amen praise
[42:39] God
[42:41] um amen uh I was going to take an hour
[42:45] or something and write down all about
[42:46] what's happened and all that but I've
[42:48] I've bypassed that and um I know that uh
[42:52] you all most of you would understand
[42:54] that my wife passed away and in March at
[42:56] the end of March amen and she had the
[42:59] the vascular dementia so if you want to
[43:02] find out what that is you can look it up
[43:04] but that's what you had it wasn't alimer
[43:06] and it was um different a different uh
[43:09] the front lobe of the brain is what what
[43:11] she had so but uh it was a wonderful
[43:14] experience to be with her throughout the
[43:16] time of her illness and uh I did care
[43:19] for her uh myself um but uh the time
[43:23] came when they told us it would come and
[43:25] the time came when she was started to go
[43:27] down and we realized that it was getting
[43:29] close and then how the Lord took her the
[43:31] last day of her life as one of the most
[43:33] precious days that I've ever lived to
[43:35] see her just go into the presence of God
[43:38] the very house that she was born in to
[43:40] see her just left and the spirit of God
[43:42] just you could see her spirit lifting
[43:44] descending out of her and when the
[43:46] Medics came and all that and uh I knew
[43:50] they would never resuscitate her I knew
[43:52] she'd went home and that night when I
[43:54] was in in in bed well we we with the joy
[43:57] of having her for about an hour and a
[43:59] half after the police had left because
[44:01] it was they'd call it sudden uh but and
[44:04] all the Medics had left uh they were
[44:06] waiting for the coroner to see what he
[44:08] was going to do well I did not want the
[44:10] coroner to cut her up and find out
[44:12] what's I didn't want that but God
[44:14] spurred us from that so I'm I'm so glad
[44:16] now I know there's there's people
[44:18] suffering tonight with that in assembly
[44:20] here but amen I just trust and pray that
[44:24] all will go well God has a great way of
[44:26] doing things and the tender hand of
[44:28] Jehovah is so precious and he'll always
[44:31] deal with you that way amen praise God
[44:34] I'm so glad about that and uh that night
[44:37] I was telling brother Ronald that you
[44:39] know that night uh it seemed that she
[44:41] came to me and she wanted and I know my
[44:44] wife I was married to her just just a
[44:46] couple of months short of 50 years just
[44:49] a couple of months short but I know my
[44:51] wife and that night she seemed to be
[44:54] trying to draw me over to the other her
[44:56] side she wanted it was so and I know
[44:58] know that's she would have liked that
[45:00] that when she was in something like that
[45:02] she would want to share it with me and
[45:04] she seemed to be calling and pulling
[45:06] into to to that way and and my my it was
[45:10] wonderful and I just told her I can't go
[45:12] it's it's not for me at this time so ah

[45:56] at the end of it he said you'll excuse
[45:58] me for being a little bit emotional it
[46:00] was just so touching what he said that
[46:03] woman from proverbs 31 and that's what
[46:06] my wife was she was a dear she never
[46:08] stood my way at all and all the years
[46:11] that that I was over preaching in

[1:11:24] praise the Lord amen um I I don't know
[1:11:27] if you've ever played sadoku does do you
[1:11:30] know what I'm talking about when I say
[1:11:31] sadoku yeah yeah well I never did that
[1:11:34] my wife was the smart one you know she
[1:11:36] used to do the crosswords and all Word
[1:11:40] Finders and all that and she did seduko
[1:11:42] as well and I think she tried to teach
[1:11:44] me how to play it but I never got on to
[1:11:46] it but after after her homecoming I I I
[1:11:49] found a book on it one day in the house
[1:11:51] and I started to do it my daughter give
[1:11:53] me kind of the things you know and and I
[1:11:55] was thinking about that you know that
[1:11:57] this morning at 6:00 I was thinking
[1:11:59] about that and the thing about it
[1:12:01] sometimes I have a great time on it I
[1:12:03] get it whoa yeah got it we tick you know
[1:12:05] but sometimes I come to the place where
[1:12:08] there's two letters maybe four and eight
[1:12:11] and I know the four either goes here or
[1:12:15] the eight goes here and so I try to work
[1:12:17] all the best I can and then I discover
[1:12:19] you put the wrong one in the wrong box
[1:12:22] and when you do that you're lost you're
[1:12:25] ain't going to get it sort of that
[1:12:26] you're going to end up in a mess of
[1:12:27] letters and I was lying in bed brother R
[1:12:30] I was thinking uh Andrew you know I'm
[1:12:32] thinking here ah you know that's right
[1:12:35] that's like like numbers in the Bible
[1:12:36] for our young people tonight amen
[1:12:38] numbers in the Bible you got to get your
[1:12:40] mathematics right praise God hallelujah
[1:12:44] and and and so I was thinking about that
[1:12:46] uh I'm thinking about coming here and I
[1:12:48] was thinking yeah number one you know
[1:12:50] what is it number one's God hallelujah
[1:12:53] and and and there's one God he stands
[1:12:55] that number stands alone it stands alone
[1:12:58] you can't if you if you try to divide
[1:13:01] one you get 3/3 and Jesus isn't one/
[1:13:04] third of the godhead is that right he's
[1:13:06] not one/ third of the godhead he is the
[1:13:08] godhead hallelujah praise the Lord and
[1:13:11] and and number two the for witness you
[1:13:13] know number two for witness Hallelujah
[1:13:15] the two witnesses that are to come and
[1:13:17] they will come because God said they're
[1:13:19] going to come hallelujah amen praise the
[1:13:22] Lord and um amen out the mouth of two or
[1:13:25] three Witnesses let every every uh word
[1:13:27] be established amen and he sent them out
[1:13:29] two by two praise God so we love that
[1:13:32] amen and three the Divine Perfection and
[1:13:35] when when you look at three it's God's
[1:13:38] Divine Perfection and you see it all
[1:13:40] over uh the shop amen he's perfected and
[1:13:43] not three offices and it is the first of
[1:13:46] the four perfect numbers 3 7 10 and 12
[1:13:50] are the perfect numbers and you multiply
[1:13:52] them and you've got 2,000
[1:13:53] 520 that's the time of Israel's judgment
[1:13:57] and the dispersia and now I thank God he
[1:13:59] promised he' bring them back I was in
[1:14:01] Israel what a time I had in Israel oh I
[1:14:03] could keep you longer brother Andrew
[1:14:05] I'll tell you than you preach really
[1:14:07] could have started going into what
[1:14:09] happened in Israel amen and uh praise
[1:14:12] God I ended up in the River Jordan
[1:14:13] baptized in a moment and it was just
[1:14:15] incredible uh yeah so yeah that tree
[1:14:18] it's it's wonderful amen and and you can
[1:14:21] go end it all the time holy holy holy is
[1:14:23] the Lord because it's three and then he
[1:14:26] came by the water the blood H amen and
[1:14:28] not only that but by the spirit that
[1:14:31] birth witness the spirit of truth that
[1:14:33] should come three and of course there's
[1:14:35] three Bibles amen now I was talking on
[1:14:39] my journey but I'll just say it this
[1:14:41] much to you tonight very quickly I said
[1:14:43] when you go into the three Bibles you've
[1:14:45] got the Stars amen the young people
[1:14:48] might know this if I asked the the the
[1:14:50] young people I said maybe even some of
[1:14:51] you older people thinking well we are we
[1:14:53] we're in the Zodiac brother Bram said
[1:14:55] well that day it was pierces amen two
[1:14:59] fish praise God and one of them was
[1:15:01] going up the way cuz this is from the
[1:15:02] oldest zodiac and and the other one was
[1:15:04] kind of horizontal and and they were
[1:15:07] joined and and you know it was then it
[1:15:10] was the bride going up and Israel joined
[1:15:12] to them the Ruth and the Naomi praise
[1:15:15] God we've got they've got a we've got a
[1:15:17] tie in there and he said that was then
[1:15:20] but that ain't n we've moved on praise
[1:15:22] God and way back in the day I'm in
[1:15:25] because I'm what 25 multiplied by uh
[1:15:29] three okay so you can work out the m and
[1:15:31] that that's what age I am now but way
[1:15:33] back in the day when the heppies were
[1:15:35] there they were singing this is the
[1:15:36] beginning of the age of a Aquarius and
[1:15:40] they missed it a million miles but we
[1:15:42] didn't miss it because if you looked up
[1:15:44] in that ancient zodiac there he is the
[1:15:46] son of man pouring out the water
[1:15:48] Hallelujah out of the big vessel coming
[1:15:50] on and he's pouring it out on the earth
[1:15:52] and that's what what we got to drink off
[1:15:54] tonight hallelujah amen wonderful and
[1:15:57] and and you know uh when we looked at
[1:15:59] the the pyramid and going up that seven
[1:16:02] the the seven stands right up going up
[1:16:05] there uh to to the uh to the Big Stone
[1:16:09] that's on the top and when you get up
[1:16:10] it's about 3ot high at the top of them
[1:16:13] seven Ines and when you get up there
[1:16:16] what you find is there's a place called
[1:16:18] The Prophet's chamber yeah it's right
[1:16:21] there and and and you you can touch it
[1:16:23] praise God if you get up there and uh
[1:16:25] there's a boss on it but I'm not going
[1:16:27] to start preaching this tonight I just
[1:16:28] wanted to to say it quickly and so uh
[1:16:32] the the main point would be that when
[1:16:34] you leave that prophet's chamber the
[1:16:36] next chamber is the King's chamber the
[1:16:39] next you're the you're the queen
[1:16:41] remember that you've come right up from
[1:16:42] the Queen's chamber right through the
[1:16:44] prophet's chamber and now you're going
[1:16:46] to the king's chamber and and it's
[1:16:49] lovely to think about it that it's it's
[1:16:52] it's about 4 F feet high and you got to
[1:16:55] bow to get into that King's chamber
[1:16:58] Hallelujah you got to bow to get into
[1:17:00] that and brother Bram said a full head
[1:17:03] of wheat always bows and it so it does
[1:17:07] praise God because you're thankful amen
[1:17:09] for what God has done for you and and
[1:17:11] it's so wonderful that there amen and uh
[1:17:15] you know fors the fors the Earth amen
[1:17:18] the Four Winds and praise the Lord the
[1:17:20] four seasons of the world are the the
[1:17:23] year which I've really I've really
[1:17:27] enjoyed I think it re once there was one
[1:17:29] night when I was in Georgia there was a
[1:17:31] massive big Thunder bang you know and it
[1:17:34] rained and it was over in about 5
[1:17:36] minutes and that's I was in bed so I
[1:17:38] didn't even see it amen and and every
[1:17:41] other day has been perfect and we've had
[1:17:43] some lovely weather up here he took me
[1:17:45] on his little cart and we've just went
[1:17:47] around and we walked together and wow
[1:17:50] I'll tell you it's been wonderful it's
[1:17:51] really been wonderful Hall Hallelujah so
[1:17:54] yeah and and five Grace for by grace are
[1:17:57] you saved Hallelujah by Grace nothing
[1:18:01] that I could have done to deserve God's
[1:18:03] only son Grace amen hallelujah uh
[1:18:07] through faith everything works through
[1:18:09] faith and Faith Works by love never
[1:18:12] forget that Hallelujah and six the
[1:18:14] number of man Adam was created the sixth
[1:18:16] day and then you've got 666 what is it
[1:18:19] man trying to prove he's God and he
[1:18:22] can't do it John Lennon Imagine there's
[1:18:25] no Heaven imagine there's no God imagine
[1:18:27] it's just only us here that's not the
[1:18:31] truth there is a God there is a Creator
[1:18:33] hallelujah praise the Lord and so uh the
[1:18:36] seven is the Perfection not the the
[1:18:39] Divine Perfection is God but the
[1:18:41] spiritual Perfection is the bride seven
[1:18:44] seven Church ages Hallelujah and we're
[1:18:47] right there the last one amen and he
[1:18:49] created the world in seven days amen and
[1:18:52] and we know that That's A Thousand Years
[1:18:54] is as a day with the Lord so thank God
[1:18:56] he done it on his own way in his own uh
[1:18:59] time and and he created it and the last
[1:19:01] thing was his the climax of his creation
[1:19:03] was making you and I that's it making
[1:19:06] man in his own image hallelujah praise
[1:19:08] the Lord and um the lovely thing about
[1:19:11] seven is uh you can't do it with one but
[1:19:14] you can do it with two but when you come
[1:19:16] to seven you got three and four three
[1:19:19] and four so if you look at the Divine
[1:19:21] Perfection and go going on with the four
[1:19:24] which is the Earthly number then you
[1:19:26] find God in some form in the Earthly
[1:19:31] number and here he is in the bread of
[1:19:33] Jesus Christ tonight Divine Perfection
[1:19:36] sitting in you and I tonight I think
[1:19:38] that's wonderful I think that's
[1:19:40] wonderful and you know uh Ronald I had a
[1:19:44] on on our ministry here I had a I was
[1:19:46] thinking deeply about Divinity what does
[1:19:49] it mean to be divine amen and uh I got a
[1:19:52] I got to been thinking about that um and
[1:19:55] it's wonderful there's only one Divine
[1:19:57] person and brother Bram was talking to a
[1:20:00] a a woman and she said I can prove that
[1:20:02] Jesus wasn't God so she started to say
[1:20:05] well he wept and he got hungry had to
[1:20:06] sleep and all he said yeah that's right
[1:20:09] that's a man he said but when he Stood
[1:20:11] Beside the tomb of Lazareth he proved he
[1:20:13] was divine yes he did when he called him
[1:20:16] out and so that the lovely thing about
[1:20:18] it is amen that uh praise God that that
[1:20:23] there's only one Divine person and
[1:20:25] that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen and
[1:20:27] and you know I thought well what's the
[1:20:29] difference between deity and Divinity
[1:20:32] and and and this is what hard I think
[1:20:34] amen you forgive that but praise God and
[1:20:37] I come to find that amen the Divine
[1:20:40] person amen uh Divinity is the
[1:20:42] distinctive nature or the very essence
[1:20:45] of God Divinity is what makes him what
[1:20:49] he is God is love Hallelujah that is
[1:20:53] divine love Love's Divine or Love's
[1:20:55] excelling and Divinity speaks of what he
[1:20:58] is praise God and so and what he does
[1:21:01] and divine Authority and and for you and
[1:21:03] I we talk about divine revelation divine
[1:21:06] revelation brought us to the place we
[1:21:08] are tonight amen it's just wonderful

[1:21:27] it'll give it to you and you know in in
[1:21:30] Romans chapter 1 and verse 20 it talks
[1:21:33] about that he showed forth his godhead
[1:21:35] and and and and really the translation
[1:21:37] you can read There is he showed forth
[1:21:39] his divinity that's what that's if you
[1:21:42] check it up yourself and so praise God

[1:23:02] the divine nature I really do Hallelujah
[1:23:05] so praise God let's get on down to this
[1:23:07] amen and um you you will forgive me
[1:23:10] Indulgence this is the way it came to me
[1:23:11] that morning and so I'm just doing it
[1:23:13] now we will get to we will get to uh the
[1:23:17] life that I now live Hallelujah but
[1:23:19] before we do I was thinking that morning
[1:23:21] about some of my my favorite quots and
[1:23:24] for the young people too and maybe not
[1:23:25] so young one of my favorite quotes is
[1:23:28] this amen where brother brandham said
[1:23:30] amen you know we believe the five
[1:23:32] comments of Elijah I'm not going to go
[1:23:33] through them but we believe them
[1:23:34] hallelujah amen and there's one coming
[1:23:36] with Moses and he said there was two
[1:23:38] that time Moses and Elijah that would
[1:23:40] come to Israel and they're coming amen
[1:23:42] but this this quote he says now the
[1:23:44] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation
[1:23:47] 10:7 is going to do two things one
[1:23:50] according to Malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:23:53] hearts of the children to the fathers
[1:23:55] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:23:58] seven Thunders wow so some people don't
[1:24:01] even know what the seven Thunders are
[1:24:02] there what well you know he will reveal
[1:24:05] the mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:24:07] that's what he's saying amen and praise
[1:24:09] God uh uh Amen in Revelation 10 and he
[1:24:13] goes on to say which are the revelations

[1:37:48] you'll give me another another a bit
[1:37:50] bigger than I am but it kept me warm and
[1:37:52] he gave me a jacket now he let me take
[1:37:54] it back to Ireland but the thing is when
[1:37:56] I went back a week later to that motel
[1:37:59] and uh by 3:00 I was getting out of the
[1:38:01] the car and uh the little manager came
[1:38:04] across she wanted to make it personal

[1:38:19] they had found it and they put it in the
[1:38:21] lost and find place and somebody had put
[1:38:23] stuff on it and but eventually they got
[1:38:25] it anyway so that's the wonderful thing
[1:38:27] amen handfuls on purpose just to show
[1:38:30] you about the Supreme deity for a moment
[1:38:32] amen praise God you know when Moses went
[1:38:34] down to Egypt he only had a judgment rod
[1:38:37] that's all he had praise God and that's
[1:38:39] not a lot I mean you know as Pharaoh
[1:38:42] would say how many divisions have you
[1:38:43] got how many battalions have you got how
[1:38:45] many tanks and chariots have you got he
[1:38:47] ain't got none of that said well what
[1:38:49] have you got he said I've got a rod
[1:38:51] well that ain't going to do you much
[1:38:53] good against my Army amen said well okay
[1:38:55] let's see and then when he began say Let
[1:38:58] My People Go and you know he said if you
[1:39:00] don't the Lord's going to pour out these
[1:39:02] these uh curses on you amen and and so
[1:39:05] he raised up the rod and and my goodness
[1:39:07] all the different things that Came Upon
[1:39:09] them and flies and lice and all kinds of
[1:39:11] things and frogs oh till it was covered
[1:39:14] the land of Egypt then Lucas and and
[1:39:16] then the very last one with the the
[1:39:17] death of the firstborn what a time that
[1:39:19] was what a time that was one time I read
[1:39:21] brother around that that you know the
[1:39:23] firstborn usually had a a little bed uh
[1:39:27] they were nearest the floor so therefore
[1:39:29] when that that came in the door they
[1:39:32] would have got it first but I'll tell
[1:39:33] you what the firstborn were going to die
[1:39:35] no matter where they were sleeping
[1:39:36] Hallelujah and so amen and here he was
[1:39:39] and three times again three times uh
[1:39:42] Moses is recorded as using the rod
[1:39:45] bringing the plagues on the Egyptians
[1:39:47] crossing the Red Sea why cry speak and
[1:39:50] he would raise up that rod and see what
[1:39:52] happens Hallelujah and the Sea began to
[1:39:55] move and let them across wonderful so
[1:39:58] Hallelujah that is that is gr glorious
[1:40:00] amen and then hallelujah when and this
[1:40:03] is good too because when uh they were
[1:40:06] fighting the amalekites and josa was
[1:40:08] down doing his business and and and the
[1:40:11] they were winning when Moses had the rod
[1:40:13] up but then he got tired and so they
[1:40:16] they said well you sit here on this rock
[1:40:18] and and hold up the rod and and Aaron

[1:45:08] uh gel and he sh under the feet of gel
[1:45:11] the best there was the smartest there
[1:45:13] was that that he could get his education

[1:45:18] Great Heights in the phy religion yes
[1:45:22] yes but you see Hallelujah there was
[1:45:25] something going to happen because God
