[16:48] touch their bodies there. want to pray
[16:51] for our pastor, Sister Trista Delaney,
[16:54] Sister Wanda Hinkle, Brother Jeff
[16:56] Breeden, that God would just continue to
[16:58] touch each and every one of them and

[17:03] Um, dear church, please keep Jamie and
[17:08] Jada in your prayer. They both are at
[17:11] home not feeling well. Thank you, Sister
[17:13] Mary Ellen. Amen. And also we want to
[17:16] remember sister Janetta this evening not
[17:19] feeling well. We want to pray for her
[17:21] that God would just touch her body
[17:23] strengthen her. I'm going ask brother
[17:24] William if you would just come pray for
[17:26] the needs this evening.
[17:32] Amen. Do you love the Lord tonight?
[17:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads and our
[17:36] hearts.
[17:38] Dear gracious heavenly father,
[17:41] Lord God, we just love you, Lord, with
[17:43] all that's within us. Lord, we thank you
[17:46] for your presence, Lord, and for your
[17:47] goodness, your grace, and your mercy,
[17:51] Lord. Thank you, oh God, for the gospel.
[17:54] Thank you for the truth.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your love that you
[17:59] would so love us, Lord. While we were
[18:01] yet sinners, you died for us. You laid
[18:04] aside all the splendor of heaven and all
[18:06] the worship of angels. You laid all that
[18:10] aside to come and walk amongst humanity
[18:13] and to allow yourself to be delivered
[18:15] into the hands of sinful men and to be
[18:18] spit upon and mocked and crowned with a
[18:22] crown of thorns. Lord, you allowed
[18:25] yourself to do that and to fall into
[18:27] their hands.
[18:28] You allowed yourself to do that because
[18:30] you seen and you knew that all of
[18:33] humanity, all of the elected, all of
[18:35] your children depended on that very
[18:38] moment, Lord. And you paid the price for
[18:40] our complete salvation,
[18:43] Lord. You paid the price for our
[18:45] healing. You paid the price for
[18:47] everything that we could ever have need
[18:49] of. You paid it at Calvary.
[18:52] And Lord, you watched over us our whole
[18:54] lives. Even before we knew you, even
[18:57] before we acknowledged you, even while
[18:59] we were running from you, before we
[19:01] surrendered, you guided our lives.
[19:04] What matchless love,
[19:07] oh God, how we love you and we thank
[19:09] you. How we worship you and we adore
[19:12] you.
[19:13] And Lord, we see in the scripture, oh
[19:15] God, when no one was worthy, you
[19:17] purchased our salvation. And then you
[19:19] stood up when no one else was worthy.
[19:21] and you claimed
[19:23] your children. You came and you took the
[19:27] book and we're identified in that. Lord,
[19:29] the prophet of God would look in that
[19:31] scripture and say, "Now is a time of
[19:33] worship.
[19:35] Now we worship you and we thank you and
[19:37] we adore you. The work's been finished.
[19:40] It's done. The mysteries are be
[19:42] revealed. And now we just rejoice in
[19:44] your presence. How we love you. We thank
[19:47] you, Lord. all the trials of life and
[19:50] all the situations that we go through.
[19:52] One moment in your presence, one glimpse
[19:56] of you will make it all worth it. Father
[20:00] God, you know each and every situation
[20:02] that we're in. Lord, you heard the
[20:04] request. We just pray, oh God, that you
[20:07] be mindful. Help us, Lord, to be
[20:09] appreciative of every victory that you
[20:11] give us. Help us, Lord, to walk in
[20:14] faith. Yes.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; Help us to just keep footsteps of
[20:18] possession, Lord, and walk in faith. We
[20:20] love you, Lord. We thank you for this
[20:22] service. We ask your blessings, Lord,
[20:24] over every life that's represented here.
[20:26] Bless the word as it goes forth. Anoint
[20:29] your servant, Brother Andrew, as he
[20:30] brings forth the word. We just love you
[20:32] and ask that you touch every life. Have
[20:34] your way in this service. We just commit
[20:36] this service into your hands now. Bless
[20:38] the offerings for your honor and your
[20:40] glory in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[20:46] Thank you. As we receive the offering
[20:47] this evening, you give us God bless you.

[21:44] over and over and over again.
[21:49] But I keep falling in love with you over
[21:54] and over.
[21:56] Over and over again.

[35:17] you woke up this morning? Maybe on the
[35:19] wrong side of the bed, your hair all a
[35:21] mess, but you woke up with your mind on
[35:23] the Lord. Amen. I woke up this morning
[35:27] with my mind.
[35:29] Oh, say,
[35:31] oh Jesus.
[35:33] Well, I woke up this morning with my
[35:36] mind.
[35:38] Oh, sing
[35:40] on the Lord.
[35:42] Well, I woke up this morning with my
[35:45] mind.
[35:47] Oh, sing.
[35:49] Oh Jesus,
[35:51] hallelujah.
[35:53] Oh, hallelujah
[35:56] to the Lord.
[35:58] Sing and praise.
[36:00] Well, I'm singing and praise with my
[36:03] mouth.
[36:05] Oh, sing.
[36:07] Oh Jesus.
[36:10] Well, I'm singing and praying with my
[36:12] mind.
[36:14] Oh, save.
[36:16] for the Lord
[36:18] will sing and pray with my mouth.
[36:23] Oh,
[36:26] for Jesus,
[36:28] hallelujah.
[36:30] Oh, hallelujah
[36:32] to the Lord. I woke up this morning.
[36:37] Well, I woke up this morning with my
[36:40] mind.
[36:41] Oh, say,
[36:44] "Oh, Jesus."
[36:46] Well, I woke up this morning with my
[36:49] mind.
[36:51] Oh, say,
[36:53] "Oh, the Lord.
[36:55] Well, I woke up this morning with my
[36:58] mind.
[37:00] Oh,
[37:03] Jesus.
[37:05] Hallelujah.
[37:07] Oh, hallelujah
[37:09] to the Lord.
[37:14] [Music]
[37:15] Amen. I'd like to sing that song. I know
[37:18] a name. I know a name. Neil,
[37:23] I'll have to have y'all help me with it.
[37:25] I love this song.
[37:29] [Music]
[37:38] I know
[37:44] that could silence roaring waves. And I
[37:49] know a name
[37:54] that can empty out.
[37:59] I know the name.
[38:05] It's the only name that saves
[38:10] and it's worthy of all praise. I call
[38:16] you Jesus.
[38:19] I call you my healer.
[38:25] rolling and raining in power.
[38:30] Something comes out of the grave.
[38:36] Every time I call Jesus,
[38:41] I call him. I call Savior.
[38:47] Worthy of glory forever.
[38:52] Something comes out of the grave
[38:58] every time I call your name.
[39:05] And I have a king
[39:11] with two million
[39:13] over death. And he holds the key.
[39:22] In his holy grail of smart hands,
[39:27] who is the he
[39:33] that has crushed the soul,
[39:37] [Music]
[39:38] our resurrected
[39:41] bra.
[39:44] I call you Jesus.
[39:48] I call you. My go
[39:56] power
[39:59] something comes out of the grave.
[40:05] Every time I call your name,
[40:11] you I call you
[40:15] worthy of glory.
[40:24] Hallelujah.
[40:27] Every time I call your name.
[40:32] Hallelujah. Ain't it wonderful to call
[40:34] on the name of Jesus?
[40:37] Ain't it wonderful to praise a true and
[40:39] living God? Know that he's right here
[40:42] amongst us moving in power and
[40:44] demonstration.
[40:46] Amen. And what an honor it is to be
[40:48] standing in this
[40:51] very wicked hour, but a very powerful
[40:54] hour to be standing in. Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; And uh we look at the events um that
[41:00] have transpired this this past week with
[41:04] u with our nation and we see a man by
[41:08] the name of Charlie Kirk getting
[41:10] slaughtered in front of America and
[41:13] and it's just a horrible thing. And I
[41:16] truly feel like we're in the sighing and
[41:19] crying of our nation.
[41:21] Truly, we see we see all of these events
[41:25] that are transpiring, but it does not
[41:27] shake us as believers. For we realize
[41:30] that we're truly living in an hour where
[41:32] these things are going to come to pass.
[41:35] And we know that my well, just to be
[41:39] honest, every one of us, Christianity
[41:42] has a target on it. And uh we just we
[41:45] just know that we are covered by the
[41:47] blood of Jesus Christ.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Do you do you just love him
[41:52] with all that is within you? Amen. May
[41:55] we try singing that song, King Jesus. I
[41:57] know you hear me when I pray.
[42:00] [Music]
[42:04] King Jesus,
[42:07] I know you hear me when I pray.
[42:11] Well, King Jesus,
[42:16] I know you hear me when I pray.
[42:20] Well, I'm down here in trouble. Lord,
[42:25] send an angel by my way.
[42:30] Well, King Jesus,
[42:34] I know you hear me when I pray.
[42:40] King Jesus,
[42:44] I know you hear me when I pray.
[42:51] Well, I'm down here in trouble, Lord.
[42:56] Send an angel by my way. Well, if you're
[43:01] sick and afflicted and you don't know
[43:04] what to do, well, just call on King
[43:07] Jesus. He will heal you, too. King
[43:11] Jesus,
[43:14] I know you hear me when I pray.

[43:25] send an angel by my way.
[43:29] Well, they put old Paul in prison. Well,

[43:40] prayer. King Jesus,

[43:49] Well, I'm down here in trouble, Lord.
[43:54] Send an angel by my way.
[43:58] Hallelujah. Well, I've come through the
[44:00] valley. I've reached the mountain top.
[44:04] Well, I'm looking in that city. Lord, I
[44:09] can't stop King Jesus.
[44:12] [Music]
[44:14] I know you hear me when I pray.
[44:19] [Music]
[44:20] Well, I'm down here in trouble, Lord.
[44:25] Send an angel by my way.
[44:29] Well, if you're sick and afflicted and

[44:58] Well, some say give me silver and some
[45:02] say give me gold. But I say give me
[45:06] Jesus. He's the rock of my soul. King
[45:10] Jesus,
[45:11] [Music]
[45:13] I know you hear me when I pray.
[45:18] Well, I'm down here in trouble. Lord,
[45:23] send an angel by my way.
[45:27] Are you want to worship the Lord
[45:28] tonight?
[45:31] &gt;&gt; King Jesus,
[45:34] I know you hear me when I pray.
[45:40] King Jesus,
[45:45] I know you hear me when I pray.
[45:51] Well, I'm down here in trouble, Lord.
[45:55] Lord, send an angel by my way.
[46:00] Hallelujah. Give the Lord a hand clap of
[46:02] praise.
[46:04] Hallelujah.
[46:06] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[46:09] If you have your Bibles this evening,
[46:11] I'd like to look over in Hebrews chapter
[46:13] 10 and verse 5.
[46:20] Deuteronomy chapter 16
[46:24] verse one and also John chapter 4 verse
[46:28] 21.
[46:37] It's good to be in the house of the
[46:38] Lord.
[46:40] It's real good.
[46:45] Amen.
[46:47] Hebrews chapter 10
[46:50] and verse 5
[46:54] before we read the word let's just speak
[46:56] to the author just now. Father, Lord, we
[46:59] come before you, Lord, as your children.
[47:02] How we love and appreciate, Lord, your
[47:04] goodness and your mercy that you have
[47:06] bestowed upon us, Lord Jesus, to know
[47:09] that you are a risen king, Lord, and
[47:11] Savior, Father, right here, Lord,
[47:14] reigning in our hearts, Lord Jesus,
[47:16] proving yourself alive, Lord. And I ask,
[47:19] God, tonight that you would just come by
[47:21] our way, Lord. Lord, we're your
[47:23] children, Father. And we truly desire,
[47:25] Lord Jesus, a touch from the master,
[47:27] Father. Lord, I know that it's good for
[47:29] us to be in the house of the Lord, but I
[47:31] I realize that I have family. Lord, we
[47:34] have our sheep, some of them that cannot
[47:36] be in the house of the Lord due to
[47:37] sicknesses and different things and
[47:39] trying to keep it from the rest of the
[47:40] body. Lord, I pray that you'd send an
[47:43] angel by their way, Lord Jesus. A
[47:45] healing angel, Lord, with the softest
[47:46] hands to go by their way and to minister
[47:49] to them because, Lord, you're that kind
[47:51] of a God that you care. You care for
[47:53] your children. And I pray God that you
[47:55] would just you would do something
[47:57] special Lord while we're here in body
[47:59] and we're worshiping. Lord, I ask that
[48:02] you would send the Holy Spirit right by
[48:04] their need Lord, right by their way,
[48:06] right by their house. Lord, I believe
[48:08] that if you had a prophet in this day
[48:09] and prayed over a certain situation and
[48:12] an angel went by a neighborhood, Lord,
[48:14] you can go up to Pain Run, Lord, you can
[48:16] go over by 340 and you can reach every
[48:19] one of these needs, Lord, at their
[48:20] locations. We just ask God that you
[48:22] would manifest yourself in a very
[48:24] special way Lord as we humble oursel
[48:27] before you tonight. We invite you Lord
[48:29] God to come Lord take this word Lord
[48:32] that has been prepared Lord Jesus in in
[48:34] our hearts Lord and here before us. We
[48:37] ask God that you would get in it and
[48:39] that your children would be blessed Lord
[48:41] by the reading of thy word tonight. We
[48:43] humble ourselves before the great I am
[48:46] in Jesus name. Amen and amen. Hebrews 10
[48:49] and verse 5, wherefore when he cometh
[48:52] into the world, he saith, sacrifice an
[48:55] offering, thou wouldest not, but a body
[48:58] hast thou prepared me. Also, Deuteronomy
[49:01] 16 and verse one. And if you're very
[49:04] familiar with the message, you know that
[49:06] this is where brother Brandham would
[49:08] take a take a thought on God's chosen
[49:11] and provided place of worship.
[49:16] Observe
[49:24] the month of Abib, and keep the Passover
[49:27] unto the Lord thy God. For in the month
[49:29] of Abib, the Lord thy God brought thee
[49:32] forth out of Egypt by night. Thou shalt
[49:35] therefore sacrifice the Passover unto
[49:37] the Lord thy God of the flock, and in
[49:40] the herd and the herd, in the place
[49:43] which the Lord shall choose to put his
[49:46] name there. In the place which the Lord
[49:49] shall choose to put his name there. also
[49:52] John chapter 4 and verse 21.
[50:08] Jesus saith unto her,"Woman, believe me,
[50:11] the hour cometh when you shall neither
[50:14] in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem
[50:17] worship the Father. You worship, you
[50:20] know not what we know what we worship.
[50:23] For salvation is of the Jews. But the
[50:26] hour cometh, and now is, when the true
[50:29] worshippers shall worship the Father in
[50:33] spirit and in truth. For the Father
[50:36] seeketh such to worship him. God is a
[50:40] spirit, and they that worship him must
[50:43] worship him in spirit and in truth. The
[50:46] woman saith unto him, I know that the
[50:48] Messiah has cometh, which is called
[50:51] Christ, when he has come, he will tell
[50:53] us all things. And Jesus said unto her,
[50:56] I that speak unto thee am he. May God
[50:59] bless his word. You may be seated
[51:01] tonight.
[51:07] By the help of the Lord, I'd like to
[51:09] just take a thought tonight on God
[51:12] crafting a worshipper. God crafting a
[51:16] worshipper and we realize that God has
[51:18] prepared himself a body to worship in.
[51:22] We realize that that is what we are to
[51:24] do as as Christians. It is our Christian
[51:27] duty to worship the true and living God.
[51:32] Brother Brandham said it in Gabriel's
[51:34] instruction to Daniel. He said, "I like
[51:36] to worship. Don't you?" Now, we don't
[51:38] come to church just to hear a sermon. He
[51:40] said, "That goes with it. But we come to
[51:42] church to worship in the spirit and in
[51:46] the truth. Now we don't want to be just
[51:48] worshippers in the spirit and then not
[51:50] just worshippers in the truth but we
[51:52] want to have both mechanics and
[51:55] dynamics. We want to worship him in
[51:58] spirit and in truth. He said we come to
[52:00] church to worship to worship in spirit
[52:03] and in truth. He said you've heard the
[52:05] truth. That's the word. He said, "See
[52:08] now to worship is to express yourself to
[52:12] him." When you begin to study in the
[52:14] book of Genesis, when God would begin to
[52:16] lay out the attributes of this creation
[52:19] of this world that we live in, you would
[52:21] see God as he's laying out the certain
[52:23] details how that how that God is laying
[52:26] out the firminant and and the waters and
[52:28] the skies and the sun and the moon. What
[52:31] was it? It was all to play a part of his
[52:34] great drama and to show forth a part of
[52:37] God's attributes. And everything that
[52:39] God that you see that God has created,
[52:42] you are looking at a part of God's
[52:44] attributes. And you can see it in your
[52:47] and you can see it in God's children
[52:49] that God's children are simply
[52:51] expressing God's attributes. I never I
[52:54] never do fully understand when I I've
[52:56] even done it myself, but you know, I
[52:58] never fully understand when a parent
[53:00] loses their mind on the way that their
[53:03] children are acting or or the way that
[53:05] they're handling theirelves and all
[53:07] those things. You know, where they got
[53:10] that from?
[53:11] They got that right from the attributes
[53:13] where they came from. So, you begin to
[53:16] see you begin to see all of those
[53:18] things. And I'm very reminded very much
[53:20] that I I am very sorry to my parents for
[53:23] the way that I acted when I was younger.
[53:25] When I begin to look at my children, I
[53:27] begin to see where they're expressing
[53:29] that from came right from my geneology
[53:32] and bosom. You see, I didn't realize
[53:35] what I was doing when I was a little bit
[53:37] younger or when I was going through
[53:39] those stages of life, but I was simply
[53:41] being a child. But you know, I I found
[53:44] this out about myself and about being a
[53:47] parent that God buil built me in a way
[53:49] that I can handle every situation that
[53:52] Ally and Reagan will ever throw at me
[53:54] because God destined me to be their
[53:57] parent. You see, I can't get mad at them
[53:59] for acting like I used to act because I
[54:02] simply gave those things to them. You
[54:04] see, and that's why we can't get mad at
[54:07] worshippers in this age. It's because we
[54:10] are simply expressing our attributes
[54:13] that are on the inside of us that come
[54:15] from the father. Now notice what
[54:18] brotherham said in the believer's
[54:19] position in Christ. He said the believer
[54:22] can only worship Christ as he is
[54:24] positionally placed in Christ. I don't
[54:27] believe you get it. He said let me go
[54:28] another route. He said a believer cannot
[54:31] worship and has no right to worship. No
[54:34] man has no right to worship the Lord
[54:36] outside of being in the body of the Lord
[54:39] Jesus Christ. Again, he would say in
[54:42] God's only provided place of worship, he
[54:44] said, "I cho I have chose to put my name
[54:47] at the door of the house. My worship for
[54:50] my family will be gathered in there
[54:52] under the blood like it was in Egypt.
[54:54] Anything outside of that died and in
[54:56] there there's no leaven bread." He said,
[54:58] "There's no denominational mixture in
[55:00] there." He said, "Notice." He said, "My
[55:02] house, my children, born of my genes."
[55:05] Amen. Glory to God. My genes are in
[55:08] them. My I put my word in them. I'll
[55:11] write them upon the tables of their
[55:13] heart. That's my family. The family of
[55:16] God. The body of Jesus Christ. The
[55:18] family. And this door you'll come in.
[55:21] Not a Methodist, not a Baptist, not a
[55:23] Pentecostal, but in the door that I put
[55:26] my name. Not in the message door.
[55:28] Hallelujah. Not in the Baptist door. Not
[55:31] in the church of Christ door. Anybody
[55:33] can tack the name of Jesus on top of
[55:36] their church, but that isn't the place
[55:37] that God is wanting a worshshiper. But
[55:40] the place that I choose to put my name,
[55:43] and we know this by the scripture that
[55:45] God chose, only one place to put his
[55:48] name at was in his son.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I apologize to my parents
[55:58] for the way that I acted, but I'm simply
[56:01] expressing what they gave me.
[56:04] Hallelujah. They were Hallelujah. So
[56:07] what you see in me came from sister
[56:09] Connie and came from brother Ron. But
[56:12] what you see in the spiritual realm,
[56:15] don't blame me. It comes from my father.
[56:20] You see, God wanted a worshipper. So he
[56:24] built a body that would worship him in
[56:27] spirit and in truth. I find it amazing
[56:30] today that God is an object of worship
[56:33] and people deny him the very right that
[56:36] he is asking of them.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:42] Hallelujah.
[56:43] You see
[56:46] worship comes from who you are.
[56:50] You see, the reason why David is one of
[56:53] the greatest worshippers is because God
[56:56] crafted him in such a way that he would
[56:59] be a worshipper that came right from the
[57:01] mind of God. When you look at Miriam and
[57:04] you look at the great worshippers
[57:05] throughout the body, throughout the
[57:07] Bible, you would recognize and see that
[57:10] God crafted them in such a way because
[57:13] God wanted a worshipper. You see, and
[57:16] what expounds on our worship is what
[57:20] we've been through.
[57:22] You see, you see, you see, God, he
[57:25] allows you. Hallelujah. He allows you to
[57:29] worship him as it flows through you, as
[57:32] God has crafted you. You see, worship
[57:35] flows from you. But it's not about what
[57:39] you do,
[57:40] but it's simply that God puts something
[57:43] on the inside of you. You see, when you
[57:45] begin to look in the scriptures and you
[57:47] will see in the book of Genesis when God
[57:49] when God created man and woman that you
[57:53] begin to see that in the beginning it
[57:55] was simply in spirit form that in him in
[57:58] Adam was both masculine and feminine
[58:01] there. But notice when God be to have a
[58:04] have a have a the one of the greatest
[58:06] surgeries that has ever taken place was
[58:09] when God laid a deep sleep to come upon
[58:12] Adam. And there he went in there and
[58:14] opened up the side of his rib. And he
[58:17] opened up his side and pulled out a rib.
[58:20] And out of that rib he created Eve. Then
[58:23] Adam when he awoke from his slumber, he
[58:26] looked at her and said, "This is woman,
[58:29] for she came out of man. She is both
[58:32] flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone."
[58:36] Her identity was on the inside of Adam.
[58:39] Hallelujah. If you could break down the
[58:41] DNA and you could go back before Adam
[58:44] and Eve were separated, you would see
[58:47] that Adam was on the inside or Eve was
[58:50] on the inside of Adam because if you
[58:52] look at it, there was masculine and
[58:54] feminine there on the inside of him. So
[58:57] Eve's identity was wrapped up on the
[59:01] inside of Adam. But Jesus at the cross,
[59:05] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, showed exactly who you were.
[59:09] And he released, hallelujah, his spirit.
[59:13] What was it that Eve's identity was on
[59:15] the inside of Adam so she could only be
[59:20] what she already was.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; She wasn't acting like somebody that had
[59:27] never lived before. She was not speaking
[59:30] like somebody had never spoke before.
[59:32] She was simply breathing and acting like
[59:36] she was because she was already in him.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; You see, true worshipper, a true worship
[59:43] comes from when a believer recognizes
[59:46] their true identity.
[59:50] You know good and well that there have
[59:52] been times before your new birth that
[59:55] you came to church and you raised your
[59:58] hands because you saw somebody else
[1:00:01] raising their hands. You said amen to
[1:00:03] the word of God because you saw somebody
[1:00:06] else doing that. You may have got in the
[1:00:09] spirit and shouted and danced because
[1:00:11] you saw somebody else doing it. But you
[1:00:14] know good and well that when you were
[1:00:16] born again that you are worshiping from
[1:00:19] another spot
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; because you can now say it's not their
[1:00:24] worship. It's not theirs. It's mine. I
[1:00:28] am a part of him. And when Eve looked at
[1:00:31] Adam
[1:00:33] said that's where I came from. And when
[1:00:36] you look at Jesus you can simply say
[1:00:39] that's where I came from.
[1:00:42] Your identity is tied to the mechanics
[1:00:46] and the dynamics.
[1:00:48] So let me say this to you. When God is
[1:00:51] looking and crafting a worshipper, God
[1:00:55] is building somebody that will worship
[1:00:57] him in spirit and in truth. Because
[1:01:00] worship is not a performance. Worship is
[1:01:04] when the spirit of God that is agreeing
[1:01:07] with the word comes forth and it agrees
[1:01:10] that spirit that is in him is in you.
[1:01:14] It is expressing exactly
[1:01:17] what he crafted you for.
[1:01:20] There have been many generations that
[1:01:22] have raised and worshiped the Lord.
[1:01:25] There have been many of people that
[1:01:27] raised and worshiped the Lord. The God
[1:01:31] wanted a last day runner.
[1:01:34] Somebody that would run all the way to
[1:01:36] the end that would worship him in good
[1:01:39] times and in bad times. To be honest, I
[1:01:44] was disgusted this week when I looked
[1:01:47] upon our nation. I think this is what
[1:01:49] we're getting. Do you realize that we
[1:01:52] had a prophet tell us when he's sitting
[1:01:54] there in JC Penney and he's looking at
[1:01:56] that demonic power as it's coming up
[1:01:59] that escalator what was it? Hell had
[1:02:01] enlarged itself and come down and dwelt
[1:02:05] on the inside of mortality. So if hell
[1:02:09] has released its power and eluced its
[1:02:11] power, how much greater should it tell
[1:02:14] us that heaven has released its power?
[1:02:17] That's the kind of body that God is
[1:02:19] looking for.
[1:02:24] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said, "Now
[1:02:26] Christ never sent me to build no
[1:02:28] organizations, but he built sent me to
[1:02:31] build up the individuals to the place
[1:02:34] that they would be a powerhouse unto
[1:02:37] God." You see, true worship is coming
[1:02:40] from a believer, and that real worship
[1:02:43] is a response from that believer's
[1:02:45] heart. And you trace it back. True
[1:02:48] worship is flowing from a spot of the
[1:02:51] new birth. Our ability to worship and to
[1:02:55] express him. It simply comes from a soul
[1:02:58] that has been born again. David would
[1:03:02] say, "Blessed is the man whom God will
[1:03:05] not impute sin to." And brother Aaron
[1:03:08] picks that up in the token. He said,
[1:03:09] "Now God will never impute sin over that
[1:03:12] token because the token is the paid sign
[1:03:15] that God has already received it and you
[1:03:17] got the token. Your faith has bought it
[1:03:20] and you have the purchase price of your
[1:03:23] redemption in your body to worship him
[1:03:27] and show forth his promises and his
[1:03:30] power.
[1:03:34] When the devil tells you the next time
[1:03:36] that you don't have a right to worship,
[1:03:39] you show him your purchased price of
[1:03:42] redemption that you got on the inside of
[1:03:44] your body where you can show forth his
[1:03:48] power and his promises. The only way
[1:03:51] that you can be a worshshiper is you
[1:03:53] worship him from a blood sacrifice where
[1:03:56] you've got to be personally identified
[1:03:59] with the lamb that died for you. You
[1:04:02] cannot live without this lamb. You
[1:04:05] cannot worship without this lamb. You
[1:04:08] cannot shout without this lamb.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that shout.
[1:04:13] There's a lot of people that get up and
[1:04:15] dance and scream. You want a good show.
[1:04:19] Just go watch YouTube. Turn on the
[1:04:22] Pentecostals of Alexandria and this that
[1:04:24] and the other. You'll find yourself a
[1:04:26] show. We did not come here for a show.
[1:04:29] We didn't come here for a performance.
[1:04:31] We come here for one reason.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; In good times, I'll praise him. In bad
[1:04:38] times, I'll praise him. When I ain't got
[1:04:39] shoes, I'll praise him. When I ain't got
[1:04:41] food on my table, I will praise him.
[1:04:46] Worship is not about performance.
[1:04:49] Worship comes from a heart that has been
[1:04:52] redeemed.
[1:04:57] God's chosen place of worship. The
[1:04:59] prophet said, "You can't live outside of
[1:05:01] him. Your church might be all right as a
[1:05:03] building. Your fellowship might be all
[1:05:05] right as a man. But when you deny the
[1:05:07] blood, the blood, the word of Jesus
[1:05:09] Christ, you're dead the minute you do
[1:05:11] it." It's God's chosen place of worship.
[1:05:14] There is where his name is. Exactly.
[1:05:18] There is where he chose to put his name.
[1:05:21] Not in the church, but in the son, Jesus
[1:05:24] Christ. Notice safety lied only in the
[1:05:28] place of his choosing, in his lamb and
[1:05:30] in the name of that lamb. Now notice
[1:05:33] what Ezekiel said in Ezekiel 36 and 25.
[1:05:37] That then I will sprinkle clean water
[1:05:39] upon you and you shall be clean from
[1:05:42] your filthiness and from your idols will
[1:05:45] I cleanse you. A new heart will I give
[1:05:47] you. A new spirit will I put within you.
[1:05:50] And I will take away the stony heart of
[1:05:52] your flesh. and I will give you a heart
[1:05:55] of flesh.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet does. He said,
[1:06:01] "That's where so many people stop."
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Another man would say it like this. He
[1:06:08] said, "You get that new spirit." He
[1:06:10] said, "You'll get to a spot and say,
[1:06:12] "Well, I really don't want to go to
[1:06:14] hell."
[1:06:16] So, I accept the Lord. He said, "When
[1:06:18] you get that new spirit, you'll start
[1:06:19] getting rid of habits." So, I got this
[1:06:21] smoke in my hand. and I I'll finish that
[1:06:23] one and then I'll be done with it. I let
[1:06:25] me finish this last drink or I he said
[1:06:27] the new spirit will get rid of your
[1:06:29] habits.
[1:06:33] But verse 27 said that I will put my
[1:06:38] spirit within you
[1:06:40] and I will put my spirit within you.
[1:06:44] It's Ezekiel 36 and 27. If you ain't got
[1:06:47] that spirit, you ain't living it.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you ain't got that
[1:06:51] spirit, you're not a worshiper.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. If you don't have
[1:06:56] that spirit, you don't know how to
[1:06:57] worship. You might know how to clap your
[1:06:59] hands. You might know how to dance like
[1:07:01] the best of us. You know, might know how
[1:07:03] to shout. You might know how to scream.
[1:07:05] You might know how to talk, tongue talk,
[1:07:07] and blabber and all those things. But if
[1:07:09] you do not have his spirit,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; you are not a worshipper.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; You are a praiser.
[1:07:17] And there is a major difference between
[1:07:19] a praiser and a worshipper. Hallelujah.
[1:07:23] Because somebody that is a praiser will
[1:07:26] praise the Lord when they got money in
[1:07:28] the bank. They will praise the Lord when
[1:07:30] they're in good health. They will praise
[1:07:32] the Lord when the answer is yes. But a
[1:07:34] worshipper will praise the Lord
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; when they're in the valley. When they
[1:07:40] don't have no money, when the answer is
[1:07:42] no.
[1:07:44] A worshipper follows
[1:07:47] I'm going to hit some devils right here.
[1:07:49] A worshipper follows a message.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; A worshipper follows a message.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I'm going to get you
[1:08:02] to shouting ground in a minute. But
[1:08:04] before you can have shouting grounds,
[1:08:06] you've got to die out. You got to kill
[1:08:09] out the Egyptians. You've got to watch
[1:08:11] them die. But if that spirit that healed
[1:08:15] that raised him from the dead, if it
[1:08:17] does not dwell on the inside of you,
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; you're not a true worshipper.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:30] I'll say it again.
[1:08:32] That I will put my spirit within you.
[1:08:36] Ain't it wonderful to have his spirit?
[1:08:40] Ain't it wonderful to know that you're
[1:08:41] not walking alone in this? That he said
[1:08:44] that I will cause you to walk in my
[1:08:47] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:08:49] and do them and you shall dwell in the
[1:08:52] land that I gave to your fathers and you
[1:08:55] shall be my people and I will be your
[1:08:58] God. You see, brother Brandham told us
[1:09:00] he said his spirit when it comes it sets
[1:09:04] right there on the very center of your
[1:09:06] heart. He said, "The new spirit will get
[1:09:09] rid of bad habits." He said, "But when
[1:09:11] his spirit comes on the inside of there,
[1:09:13] he'll control your faith. He'll control
[1:09:15] your emotions. He'll control your
[1:09:17] senses." He said, "It's kind of like a
[1:09:19] main spring of a watch." He said, he
[1:09:22] said it sits right in the middle of it.
[1:09:24] He said it sits right there in the
[1:09:25] middle of it and it controls all the
[1:09:27] mechanics of it. Hallelujah. It controls
[1:09:30] everything so that you're not operating
[1:09:32] just by mechanics, but you're operating
[1:09:35] by mechanics. and dynamics. That main
[1:09:38] spring of a real watch, if it's wound up
[1:09:41] one time, it stays wound up.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; It stays wound up. You say, "Well,
[1:09:47] Brother Andrew, you're just trying to
[1:09:49] wind them up." Oh, no. These people stay
[1:09:51] wound up. These people stay ready. These
[1:09:55] people love to worship.
[1:09:58] These people love to get on their feet.
[1:10:00] These people love to shout. These people
[1:10:03] I don't have to wind them up. Christ
[1:10:05] round them up on the day of Pentecost.
[1:10:08] That same spirit.
[1:10:16] Notice what Paul said in Colossians
[1:10:18] 2:20.
[1:10:20] Wherefore, if you be did with Christ
[1:10:23] from the rudiments of the world, why and
[1:10:25] so living in the world are you subject
[1:10:30] to ordinances?
[1:10:33] If you really are dead to it, then why
[1:10:36] are you trying to work it up?
[1:10:40] Whoa. Touch not, handle not, taste not,
[1:10:43] which are all to perish with the using
[1:10:46] after the commandments and doctrines of
[1:10:48] men, which thing have indeed a show of
[1:10:50] wisdom in will worship. Will worship is
[1:10:53] a worship on man's terms.
[1:10:57] Ain't you glad you ain't got to worship
[1:10:58] the Lord from some man's terms, some
[1:11:01] dogma terms, some ideology terms, but
[1:11:03] you're worshiping from a heart that the
[1:11:06] Hallelujah. Saul didn't have to tell
[1:11:08] David how to worship. Ji didn't have to
[1:11:11] tell David how to worship. His mama
[1:11:14] didn't have to tell him how to worship.
[1:11:15] Ron don't have to tell me how to
[1:11:17] worship. Connie don't have to tell me
[1:11:19] how to worship. God
[1:11:21] crafted a worshshiper.
[1:11:29] show of wisdom and will worship and
[1:11:32] humility, neglecting of the body, not an
[1:11:36] honor to the satisfying of the flesh.
[1:11:40] Paul was saying if we are dead to
[1:11:43] ourselves and we're dead with Christ,
[1:11:46] then worship is not about rules.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; That's what this woman at the whale was
[1:11:52] worried about. That's all she'd ever
[1:11:54] heard her entire life. I'd say that's a
[1:11:57] lot of you ex Amish. That's all you
[1:11:59] heard all your life was worship.
[1:12:02] Worshiping from rules. Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] But if you're dead, like Paul said, you
[1:12:08] are worshiping from resurrection and
[1:12:10] life. Paul is saying you ain't got to
[1:12:12] work it up. You ain't got to work it
[1:12:14] down by traditions. Just let the spirit
[1:12:17] breathe. One thing I found out about
[1:12:19] fire, if you just give it some fuel and
[1:12:21] give it a little bit of oxygen, it'll
[1:12:23] take off.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Well, I say don't you dare stand up and
[1:12:28] put a
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; and put a fire hydrant and water this
[1:12:33] thing down.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; I say let the fire fall and let the
[1:12:38] spirit get on it and breathe. Breathe.
[1:12:49] God knew what he was doing
[1:12:52] when he built David.
[1:12:55] David was a man that was going to do a
[1:12:58] lot of things in his life. David was a
[1:13:01] man that was going to have some scars
[1:13:04] and complexes and stigmas and sin in his
[1:13:07] life.
[1:13:09] But God was crafting him in a way
[1:13:14] that he would worship him from his pain.
[1:13:18] Some of the most beautiful songs in the
[1:13:20] Bible are written from pain.
[1:13:26] We all times often look at the high
[1:13:28] things and we think my I'd love been
[1:13:32] where David was. But if you really get
[1:13:33] to studying out where them songs came
[1:13:35] from, they come from a valley. They come
[1:13:38] from a spot of despair. They came They
[1:13:40] came when his skin and everything, his
[1:13:43] family turned against him. But in that
[1:13:45] moment, David still chose to be a
[1:13:48] worshshiper because God crafted him to
[1:13:51] worship.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Now Paul said in Ephesians 5:29, "For no
[1:13:56] man ever yet hated his own flesh, but
[1:13:59] nourisheth it and cherish it, even as
[1:14:02] the Lord the church."
[1:14:07] Who's the number one? You take care of
[1:14:10] you.
[1:14:13] That wasn't just pointed at brother
[1:14:14] Noah. That's pointed at all. You
[1:14:17] fire breaks out in here. Who you going
[1:14:20] to take care of?
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; You're going to take care of your flesh.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Paul it. You nourish it. You strengthen
[1:14:29] it. But just like you care for yourself,
[1:14:33] the father cares for you. He loves you.
[1:14:36] He wants to make sure that you're okay.
[1:14:39] For we are members of his body, of his
[1:14:42] flesh, and of his bone. That's why Jesus
[1:14:46] said, he said, "You cannot put new
[1:14:48] wine." Hallelujah. In old bottles. But
[1:14:52] you got to put new wine in new bottles
[1:14:55] because old bottles without the new
[1:14:57] birth cannot handle the message.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; You can see people get on Facebook. You
[1:15:04] can see people get on there and blow up
[1:15:07] at the world.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; But let God try to put his spirit on the
[1:15:11] inside of you and you watch. Hallelujah.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that thing's got to be
[1:15:17] flexible. It's got to move with it. It's
[1:15:20] got to get in rhythm with it. It's got
[1:15:22] to have some room for expansion. That's
[1:15:24] why brother Brandham said if you can
[1:15:26] ever have a breakthrough, he said when
[1:15:28] you get on that side of the
[1:15:29] breakthrough, he said there's 50 miles
[1:15:32] of elbow room. Well, baby, give me some
[1:15:34] room. I'm expanding.
[1:15:37] [Applause]
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Andrew, how do I
[1:15:44] really know whether
[1:15:46] I got it or not?"
[1:15:50] Well, it's real simple. I've never had
[1:15:51] an issue of this. Just give it the word
[1:15:54] test.
[1:15:58] Love thy neighbor.
[1:16:01] That baby will blow up. I can't do that.
[1:16:05] Get rid of your pride. I can't do that.
[1:16:13] Oh,
[1:16:14] got some of that, huh?
[1:16:17] You see, you cannot put the message on
[1:16:19] the inside
[1:16:21] of old rags
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; cuz it won't know how to worship, right?
[1:16:28] But oh, if you're worshiping from a new
[1:16:31] birth,
[1:16:36] you ever put on a new pair of shoes?
[1:16:40] I have to do it quite often.
[1:16:45] I don't know if you know this about me,
[1:16:46] but I sweat quite a bit while I'm
[1:16:48] preaching.
[1:16:51] And there's something about sweat on the
[1:16:54] body. It seems seems to run down and it
[1:16:57] goes right in my shoes. And these shoes,
[1:17:00] Brother Matthew bought me a couple a
[1:17:02] couple weeks ago for my birthday. And it
[1:17:04] probably won't be too long and them
[1:17:06] babies will be expanded
[1:17:09] because things have stripped down in
[1:17:12] there and they begin to expand. You ever
[1:17:14] you ever put them on and they just don't
[1:17:16] feel just right? They're still a little
[1:17:18] tight around the edges and they snug up
[1:17:20] to you. But if you can put some work on
[1:17:22] them things,
[1:17:24] they'll start to loosen up and you'll
[1:17:26] start to get a little comfortable in
[1:17:27] them. That's the way sometimes you get a
[1:17:30] service kind of like this and things
[1:17:33] gets a little tight. I found out baby
[1:17:35] got a new pair of shoes and
[1:17:39] they can't can't just work right in them
[1:17:41] just yet. But if you can just give them
[1:17:43] a little bit of time, let them get a
[1:17:46] little worked out and maybe let the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost run down over top of them.
[1:17:51] Hallelujah. Then the Holy Ghost, like
[1:17:53] brother Brandham said, I brought my joy
[1:17:55] shoes to church. I brought my joy shoes
[1:17:58] to church. Let me say this. I didn't
[1:18:01] bring some shoes here that need to be
[1:18:03] broke in. I brought some shoes that know
[1:18:05] how to dance. Some shoes that know what
[1:18:08] it's like to have joy. I brought a heart
[1:18:10] here that knows like to worship.
[1:18:15] Why? Because God built a worshipper.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:26] Jesus said, "Peace be unto you.
[1:18:29] For as my Father has sent me, even so
[1:18:32] send you." And the scripture said that
[1:18:35] he breathed on them
[1:18:38] and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost."
[1:18:42] And you watch a lot of people, that's a
[1:18:43] bunch of nonsense in the world. You walk
[1:18:46] up to them and now they got the Holy
[1:18:49] Ghost.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Some of the most ridiculous stuff I've
[1:18:53] ever seen in my life.
[1:18:55] One of the man said they he said how
[1:18:57] they got it is that they went up there
[1:19:00] on the day of Pentecost when they'd shut
[1:19:03] themselves in there on the inside of
[1:19:06] that room and there he breathed on them
[1:19:09] the Holy Ghost. He said what it was. He
[1:19:12] was prophesying over top of him in John
[1:19:15] chapter 20. But it took going to an
[1:19:17] upper room. You see the reason why Judas
[1:19:20] blew up was because he had an old
[1:19:22] bottle. He never could go up there to
[1:19:25] Pentecost.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; But hallelujah, there was some Marys
[1:19:29] that decided to go. There was some James
[1:19:31] and some John's and Peters that decided
[1:19:33] to go up there on the day of Pentecost
[1:19:36] and got what they came for. Brother
[1:19:38] Brandham said, "The church is born by
[1:19:41] the breath of God."
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Few years ago, I took my daughters up
[1:19:49] there to Williamsburg. was doing a
[1:19:51] little homeschool little trip and and I
[1:19:54] always enjoy that little trip, but they
[1:19:56] got this certain little area and many of
[1:19:57] you probably already been there. But
[1:19:59] there they got a a master glass blower
[1:20:03] there. It goes in there and
[1:20:07] it's some of the most amazing things
[1:20:08] that you've ever watched. And I was
[1:20:10] sitting there watching that and I
[1:20:11] thought, my that's a powerful little
[1:20:14] illustration that he's given us here.
[1:20:16] You watch that guy got that big old long
[1:20:18] rod. And I didn't really know what I was
[1:20:19] looking at at the time. But here he
[1:20:23] takes this long rod and he dips it down
[1:20:24] in this molten rock it looks like. And
[1:20:27] he takes that rock and when he comes out
[1:20:29] it just looks like it's it's completely
[1:20:32] formless. Don't have no life to it. Just
[1:20:35] burning hot.
[1:20:37] And all of a sudden that master black
[1:20:40] glass blower that could have got bad.
[1:20:44] Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:49] He begins to take that and he begins to
[1:20:50] blow. Yeah, y'all. Y'all welcome. Y'all
[1:20:54] welcome.
[1:20:57] I don't y'all don't have to wait for my
[1:20:58] bloopers. I'll point them out to you.
[1:21:01] But he begins to take that thing. He
[1:21:04] begins to blow on that rod and all of a
[1:21:06] sudden, what you would see is a
[1:21:09] completely formless piece of lump. all
[1:21:12] of a sudden begins to have some life to
[1:21:15] it.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; It begins to take shape and it it it
[1:21:18] begins to expound. It begins to go out
[1:21:20] there. But he doesn't just leave it
[1:21:23] there. He begins to take it and shape
[1:21:25] it. He begins to roll it on a certain
[1:21:27] stone so he gets a certain mold to it.
[1:21:30] And then he takes his pliers. If he
[1:21:32] wants a handle on that jar, he simply
[1:21:34] takes a plier that is built. Hallelujah.
[1:21:37] It is built to go in there and so it
[1:21:40] doesn't break it. He goes in there and
[1:21:42] puts it to its right spot so the
[1:21:45] master's got a place where he can put
[1:21:47] his hand.
[1:21:49] He begins to mold it in such a way so
[1:21:52] that when he wants to fill it himself
[1:21:55] and drink from his own cup, he molds it
[1:21:59] in such a way. Now, some of you don't
[1:22:01] understand the trials like you've been
[1:22:04] going through. You don't understand the
[1:22:06] process that you've been going through.
[1:22:08] But the master is breathing his life on
[1:22:12] the inside. Hallelujah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; On the inside of you. And it might get
[1:22:17] hot. And it might get to a spot where
[1:22:19] you don't understand why.
[1:22:27] Sister Mary, why did you have to go
[1:22:29] through what you went through lately?
[1:22:31] Sister wonder why did you have to go
[1:22:33] through what you're going through? It's
[1:22:35] because the master wants a drink from
[1:22:38] your cup.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] That's why Paul could say, "We have this
[1:22:47] treasure
[1:22:49] in earthn vessels." Hallelujah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:22:57] there's a lot of people that worship,
[1:23:01] but you are in contact
[1:23:04] with a higher authority.
[1:23:06] You see, Brother Brham would tell us, he
[1:23:08] said, "You are Gentiles in your bodies
[1:23:10] just like everybody else walking down
[1:23:11] the street. But the difference between
[1:23:13] you and them is that your souls have
[1:23:17] been born again." He said down on the
[1:23:19] inside of there, he said God put a
[1:23:21] strain on the inside of you in the
[1:23:23] message believing God. He said he put a
[1:23:25] strain on the inside of you that he
[1:23:26] could send you through it and you would
[1:23:28] trust God. You see, you cannot worship
[1:23:31] God without a bornagain experience.
[1:23:35] You cannot worship God without an
[1:23:37] experience. But you've got to go through
[1:23:39] the fire and know, hallelujah, that you
[1:23:42] can stand it, that you can go through
[1:23:44] the heat. God had some worshippers one
[1:23:46] time that refused to bow down to the
[1:23:49] image of man. They refused to bow down
[1:23:52] to Satan's plans of worship. I tell you
[1:23:54] what they found out, brother Chris, is
[1:23:56] they found out that God will meet you in
[1:23:59] worship even if it's in fire.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said. I love
[1:24:04] having a prophet that can look all the
[1:24:06] way back there 3,000 4,000 years ago and
[1:24:09] look back there in that fiery furnace
[1:24:11] and he don't just see a fire, but he
[1:24:13] sees three Hebrew boys sitting there.
[1:24:19] I love
[1:24:21] he said all of a sudden he said the
[1:24:23] angels in heaven are asking
[1:24:26] do I need to go down there? Do I need to
[1:24:28] go down there and help Gab's family out?
[1:24:31] Do I does do I need to send a gabriel
[1:24:34] down there?
[1:24:36] Do I need to send Wormwood? Do I need to
[1:24:38] send him down there? He Oh, no. I'm
[1:24:41] going myself.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said. He said
[1:24:48] all of a sudden he said, "I said I'm
[1:24:49] going. I'm going down there. Don't you
[1:24:51] worry, boys. I'm going." He said he
[1:24:53] wretched over there. I think it's
[1:24:55] amazing, Teddy. The prophet saw him
[1:24:56] reach over there and grab a hold of a
[1:24:58] zigzag lightning. And here he comes all
[1:25:01] the way from glory. You think it's a
[1:25:03] great far distance. He said, "Oh no,
[1:25:04] those dimensions are real close." And he
[1:25:07] grabs a zigzag lightning and all of a
[1:25:09] sudden he's in glory and the next
[1:25:10] minutes he's in the fire. He said, "What
[1:25:12] did he do?" He grabbed a big palm leaf
[1:25:15] off the tree of life and begin to fan
[1:25:18] those flames right off of him.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said. He said,
[1:25:23] "You want to hear what he was saying to
[1:25:25] him?" He said, "Because you are
[1:25:26] Abraham's children is the reason why I
[1:25:29] showed up here and you have a promise.
[1:25:31] That's the reason why I'm here. The
[1:25:33] reason why God will not leave you in
[1:25:35] Leosa all on your own is because you are
[1:25:39] a part of Abraham's seed. I gave you a
[1:25:41] promise and the Holy Ghost, the son of
[1:25:44] man, Melzdc, is here to answer it."
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; It bother you about Charlie Kirk Lord?
[1:25:52] Yeah, it bother me. probably should not
[1:25:54] ask me what I thought should be done to
[1:25:56] that guy.
[1:25:58] Some of you would not think I was a
[1:26:00] Christian.
[1:26:03] It bother you? Lord Jab bother me. Is he
[1:26:07] bride? I don't know. Really ain't up to
[1:26:10] me to make that call. One thing I do
[1:26:12] know that man stand stood for Christ.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; He identified himself as a Christian.
[1:26:23] He led people to Christ.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Now you watch what happens.
[1:26:34] You'll find out how many Christians are
[1:26:35] still left in the world.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; But when that man died, did we stop?
[1:26:42] Now, I'm not Now, let me say, let me
[1:26:44] stop right there. I'm not saying that's
[1:26:46] it. I'm not saying he's a prophet. I'm
[1:26:48] not saying that whatsoever. I don't want
[1:26:49] somebody clip that. Surprise, somebody
[1:26:50] will. I got enough idiots out there that
[1:26:52] will do it.
[1:26:54] You watch. What I'm trying to point out
[1:26:56] to you is Satan thought that he could
[1:26:58] kill William Brandham.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; They thought they could kill William
[1:27:03] Brandom by an alcoholic driver going
[1:27:05] down a road. That didn't stop the
[1:27:07] message.
[1:27:10] They thought they could put Paul in a
[1:27:11] prison. That didn't stop the message.
[1:27:13] They thought they could hang Jesus on a
[1:27:15] cross. That didn't stop the message.
[1:27:22] What are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[1:27:24] saying this that if you don't have his
[1:27:26] spirit, then you're going to go through
[1:27:28] the tribulation.
[1:27:31] And you think what they did to Charlie
[1:27:33] Kirkusbank.
[1:27:34] You wait till the Knights of Columbus
[1:27:37] come hunting down those that identified
[1:27:39] themselves with Jesus. I say while the
[1:27:42] ark doors open, get in it.
[1:27:47] [Applause]
[1:27:49] I got family I want to get in it.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; I got loved ones I want to get in it. I
[1:27:54] got people in this church I want to get
[1:27:56] in it. So God crafted a worshipper that
[1:28:01] would not stop, that would not give up.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; So therefore, I will worship the Lord.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; When they want me to stop, I will still
[1:28:12] worship. When they want me to shut up, I
[1:28:15] will still worship. When they don't want
[1:28:17] me to dance, I will still dance.
[1:28:20] When they don't want me to preach, I
[1:28:22] will still preach.
[1:28:31] There's a lot of things I could say
[1:28:32] there, but I got to go on.
[1:28:35] But worship
[1:28:37] is our identity.
[1:28:39] You see, Adam recognized Eve as bone of
[1:28:42] his bone and flesh of his flesh. And
[1:28:45] Christ recognizes his bride as himself
[1:28:48] just in another form. And that's what
[1:28:50] scares
[1:28:52] hell to death.
[1:28:54] Satan literally fears this revelation
[1:29:00] because I want to give you an
[1:29:02] announcement.
[1:29:04] Worship is not noise.
[1:29:08] That's right.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Worship is not just noise.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; I tell you what worship is. Worship is
[1:29:17] Christ living in the body. Worship is
[1:29:20] laying hands on the sick and then
[1:29:21] recovering. Worship is Christ speaking.
[1:29:24] Worship is Christ healing. Worship is
[1:29:26] Christ moving. The true worshippers
[1:29:28] shall worship the father in spirit and
[1:29:32] in truth. So worship is the bride
[1:29:35] standing in her identity.
[1:29:39] Worship is recognition
[1:29:42] of your relationship with the master.
[1:29:47] You say, "Well, what does that mean?"
[1:29:49] Give me a scripture for that. When Peter
[1:29:51] is standing there and Jesus asked this
[1:29:54] hard question said, "Whom do men say
[1:29:56] that I the son of man am?"
[1:29:58] And Peter be to speak to him
[1:30:02] and he be to say, "Thou art the Christ,
[1:30:06] the son of the living God." You see,
[1:30:09] when that revelation struck Peter, it
[1:30:12] confirmed who Christ was. But it didn't
[1:30:15] just leave it there. It confirmed who
[1:30:17] Peter was.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; And when you come to this message with
[1:30:21] arms wide open, it does not confirm
[1:30:25] Hallelujah. It doesn't just confirm that
[1:30:27] the message is right. It confirms you
[1:30:30] because worship is birthed when
[1:30:32] revelation of his identity unlocks
[1:30:35] revelation of your identity.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What was that woman waiting
[1:30:43] for? Somebody to unlock her true
[1:30:47] identity.
[1:30:53] You know good and well you was waiting
[1:30:55] on this message.
[1:30:57] They tell right brother Samuel you was
[1:31:00] waiting on this message.
[1:31:03] But I remember going through the stages
[1:31:05] of a teenager
[1:31:11] trying to figure out who I was.
[1:31:15] I never was one of them guys that wanted
[1:31:17] to wear my pants down below my
[1:31:24] never made it out the house.
[1:31:29] Maybe that's what they built them belts
[1:31:31] for.
[1:31:34] I can tell you if I ever did that belt
[1:31:36] be coming off.
[1:31:41] I understood.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; I understand what it's like to go
[1:31:44] through young people trying to figure
[1:31:45] out who you are.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; You got peer pressure on every side
[1:31:49] trying to figure out your identity.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we were talking about last
[1:31:53] weekend. I didn't realize why I had to
[1:31:54] preach last weekend before I preach this
[1:31:56] weekend. But I truly understand it now
[1:31:59] that before you can really be a
[1:32:01] worshipper, you got to break into your
[1:32:03] identity. And when you break into your
[1:32:05] true identity, let me say this. I tried
[1:32:08] that. I tried this. I tried this and I
[1:32:10] tried that and it didn't work. But when
[1:32:13] the message found me, I found out who I
[1:32:17] truly was.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] Paul said in Romans 8:15 said, "For you
[1:32:30] have not received the spirit of bondage
[1:32:32] again to fear, but you receive the
[1:32:34] spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba
[1:32:36] father. The spirit itself beareth
[1:32:38] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:32:40] children of God.
[1:32:42] His spirit identifies with our spirit
[1:32:46] that we are the children of God. What
[1:32:49] does that mean? It means you don't
[1:32:51] worship to become a child. You worship
[1:32:53] because you are a child.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; You are of God, little children. And
[1:32:58] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:33:01] that is in the world.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are either going to be
[1:33:06] of the world, a part of it, or you're
[1:33:09] going to be of him.
[1:33:13] Ye are of God, little children, and have
[1:33:17] overcome him. Because greater is he that
[1:33:20] is in you than he that is in the world.
[1:33:24] We are of God, and he that knoweth God
[1:33:27] heareth us, and he that is not of God
[1:33:29] heareth not us. Hereby know we the
[1:33:31] spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
[1:33:34] There are two persons in that scripture.
[1:33:38] But don't just miss God and Satan. Look
[1:33:41] for yourself.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; I carry certain characteristics because
[1:33:48] I was crafted by my mother and my father
[1:33:51] of Fraser
[1:33:53] and Spencer. You can look pictures of my
[1:33:56] papa Charlie and you can look at it and
[1:33:58] say, "My goodness, that looks exactly
[1:33:59] like Andrew." And you can look at the
[1:34:01] other picture of my granddaddy Homer and
[1:34:02] said, "My goodness, they look like a
[1:34:04] spitting image." To be honest, I watched
[1:34:07] my granddaddy Homer. I preached with him
[1:34:09] for about 10 years.
[1:34:12] Yeah. Right at nine years. I preached
[1:34:14] with him right here. But to be honest, I
[1:34:16] was never with him in what we would call
[1:34:17] his heydays. I never really got to truly
[1:34:20] I saw it as a child, but I could not
[1:34:22] bring those things into my memory. I
[1:34:24] never really really get to see him dance
[1:34:26] himself across these bananisters and go
[1:34:28] across them things and walk all over and
[1:34:30] dance all night and preach all night. Do
[1:34:32] it again. Dance again, preach again.
[1:34:34] Dance again. Well, if you don't want to
[1:34:37] dance, don't come to this church. But if
[1:34:38] you do want to dance, we believe in
[1:34:40] them.
[1:34:43] But I never did really get to see either
[1:34:45] one of them in their heyday. But there
[1:34:46] are people that here were here when this
[1:34:49] church was originated that tell me I
[1:34:51] throw my head like brother Homer. I
[1:34:53] point my finger like brother Homer. I
[1:34:55] even dance like brother Homer. Sometimes
[1:34:57] I sing like brother Homer. Now why is
[1:35:00] that? It's because there was something
[1:35:02] crafted on the inside of me. I didn't
[1:35:05] make those things up.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me preaching to you?
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Do you hear me preaching to you? I
[1:35:13] didn't make them things up. It's because
[1:35:15] something was locked on the inside of
[1:35:18] me. But when the spirit of God poured
[1:35:21] his life on the inside of me, it
[1:35:23] unlocked my true identity.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; So I look like a Spencer. I dance like a
[1:35:30] Frasier. I sing like a Fraser. I'm a
[1:35:34] little bit taller than some of the
[1:35:36] Spencers.
[1:35:46] But granddaddy Homer told me I did not
[1:35:48] get all these good looks from brother
[1:35:49] Homer. Brother Charlie himself said some
[1:35:52] of them came from him.
[1:35:56] What is it?
[1:35:58] I look, I talk, I act, I sing like a
[1:36:02] Spencer. Why? Because that's where I
[1:36:05] came from. I sing, I dance, I shout like
[1:36:08] a Fraser. Why? Because that's where I
[1:36:10] came from. I walk like a Christian. I
[1:36:13] talk like a Christian. I act like a
[1:36:15] Christian. I sing like a Christian. I
[1:36:17] dance like a Christian. Why? Because
[1:36:20] something was locked up on the inside of
[1:36:22] me. But when Jesus unlocked the
[1:36:25] revelation of who I was, my true
[1:36:28] identity was poured out.
[1:36:31] If I had the spirit of John Dillinger,
[1:36:33] then I would do John Dillinger's work.
[1:36:35] If I had the spirit of Picasso, then I
[1:36:38] do Picasso's work. But if I have the
[1:36:40] spirit of Jesus Christ, then I'll work
[1:36:42] like Jesus. I'll act like Jesus. I'll
[1:36:45] talk like Jesus.
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:51] Let's
[1:37:00] part two, part three, part four probably
[1:37:02] coming.
[1:37:05] Why? Because God wants a worshshiper.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:18] Hallelujah.
[1:37:20] I love what the prophet said. I'm going
[1:37:22] to close with this quote
[1:37:24] in the rapture.
[1:37:27] And I love what the prophet said in his
[1:37:28] closing hours of ministry.
[1:37:31] He said, ' But notice, look each one of
[1:37:33] you people. Do you know years before you
[1:37:36] were born, you were in your father as a
[1:37:39] gene,
[1:37:42] a germ, a seed was in your father. Comes
[1:37:44] from the male sex, not the female.
[1:37:46] Female furnishes the egg, the bidding
[1:37:48] ground. But the germ come in now say,
[1:37:51] "I'm in my father." He said, "If you've
[1:37:52] got eternal life, you were in God before
[1:37:57] there ever was a world."
[1:37:59] Before
[1:38:02] there ever was a world, I was locked on
[1:38:07] the inside of Elohim.
[1:38:09] You are a part, a son of God, an
[1:38:12] attribute of God. He knowed the very age
[1:38:15] that you were coming and he
[1:38:17] predestinated you to that age
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; to take that place
[1:38:22] and no one else
[1:38:25] can take it.
[1:38:29] This woman,
[1:38:32] she was in a bad place
[1:38:36] just like many of you were in a bad
[1:38:38] place.
[1:38:39] But God was looking for a worshiper.
[1:38:43] So God had his identity locked on the
[1:38:47] inside of her because God wanted to
[1:38:51] worship her.
[1:38:53] God bless you from Matthew.
[1:38:59] [Applause]
[1:39:04] worshiping you.
[1:39:09] Just worshiping you.
[1:39:15] Oh, there's nothing else that I would
[1:39:20] rather do.

[1:39:43] in love with you.
[1:39:50] I long for those moments when just you
[1:39:54] and I get lost in your presence and lose
[1:39:59] track of time.
[1:40:01] When I'm overwhelmed
[1:40:04] by your glory divine and I'm left with
[1:40:08] only one thing to do,
[1:40:11] worshiping you.
[1:40:17] I'm worshiping you.
[1:40:22] Oh, there's nothing else that I would
[1:40:28] rather do.
[1:40:31] I love you, Lord.

[1:40:57] I long for those moments when just you
[1:41:00] and I get lost in your presence and lose
[1:41:06] track of time.
[1:41:08] When I'm overwhelmed

[1:41:14] only one thing to do,

[1:41:35] do to you.
