[39:57] if you'd like to
[39:59] amen I bring you greetings from Edmonton
[40:02] Canada brother Ed hammermeister's church
[40:05] and we had wonderful meetings there
[40:08] to me I thought it was the greatest
[40:09] meetings that we've ever had there but
[40:11] we're getting closer to the coming of
[40:13] the Lord so
[40:15] had a wonderful wonderful time there but
[40:17] with Brother Ray Erickson and brother
[40:19] Nathan his grandson preaching for us
[40:22] that was just with us and
[40:23] and had awesome meetings there and well
[40:27] attended and so God just did amazing
[40:29] things and then we went to brother Joe
[40:31] Greene some of you were there thank you
[40:33] for coming and
[40:35] and we had incredible meetings there
[40:37] a prayer line on Friday night and
[40:41] and they got out about 12 30 I believe
[40:45] it was and so uh
[40:48] I thought they was going to tear the
[40:49] building down so
[40:51] God did just incredible things there and
[40:54] so
[40:55] then brother Andrew don't mean to go
[40:57] quick over these things but brother
[40:58] Andrew is and Brother David Mayer is at
[41:01] Mount Baker
[41:02] you can be proud of that guy he has
[41:05] he has hit he hit two home runs this
[41:08] week and uh
[41:09] amen they're really thrilled with with
[41:11] what God has did and Brother David Mayer
[41:14] will be speaking the last service here
[41:16] in a few hours and so for their Sunday
[41:18] morning service last night they got out
[41:21] after midnight so
[41:23] so they had an awesome time and so I'm
[41:27] just thankful to be a part of what God
[41:29] is doing
[41:31] I'm really thrilled it's not up to a man
[41:34] and it's not the personality of a man
[41:37] that's doing this it's God that's doing
[41:39] it
[41:40] and we're just right in the middle of it
[41:42] it says that we're getting ready to go
[41:44] home prodigals are coming in from
[41:47] everywhere and so that tells us it
[41:50] signals to us that the Rapture is Right
[41:52] imminent and at hands so we're just
[41:55] thankful for what God is doing this
[41:58] morning we want to bring all of our
[42:00] school uh it's one it's a good tradition

[50:13] sure been praying for you all of you
[50:15] there
[50:18] for those that don't know a suffering
[50:20] Dimension a lot of UTIs and
[50:24] kind of out of his head
[50:26] became aggressive
[50:28] and that that happens to a lot of people
[50:31] it shows that our soul is saved that
[50:34] Gene seed of God is there but it shows
[50:37] that this flesh is not saved
[50:40] it's you know the Holy Ghost as long as
[50:42] it's there it calls the bridle on it
[50:45] but when the Mind begins to deteriorate
[50:48] isn't that a cruel It's a cruel enemy
[50:51] that we fight and so
[50:53] we want to pray for Brother Bill that
[50:55] God would just touch him and
[50:57] and
[50:59] calm his spirit I I think that's the way
[51:02] that we need to pray that God would calm
[51:04] his Spirit down and
[51:06] and uh
[51:08] to where he wouldn't be a danger to
[51:09] Sister Linda or
[51:11] even even wander Seth or Randy I think
[51:15] Randy could probably take care of
[51:16] himself but
[51:17] you know we want to make sure we want to
[51:19] make sure and
[51:20] I would just make sure there's no no
[51:23] weapons in the house if I could give you
[51:25] that I think you've already done that
[51:27] but
[51:29] it's a difficult time so we want to
[51:32] remember him in prayer all the others
[51:34] that are I think that God would just
[51:37] touch them in a special way
[51:38] amen
[51:40] amen amen God knows how to take care of
[51:43] all things and
[51:45] amen so if your loved one would slip in
[51:48] that realm and they begin to they begin
[51:50] to say things it's ugly just know that
[51:53] isn't them

[51:58] nature and that's an enemy that's crept
[52:00] in it
[52:01] and thank God there's a land beyond the
[52:04] river
[52:05] just thank God that there's a land

[52:09] wrongs and makes all wrongs right and so
[52:12] amen we love you today and we thank you
[52:15] for being here thank you for your giving
[52:17] thank you for all the things that you've
[52:19] done and your prayers for us over the
[52:21] last couple of weeks and let's stand to
[52:23] our feet today
[52:26] amen
[52:27] if you will turn with me to Saint John
[52:29] chapter 3
[52:31] and then we'll go to
[52:34] Luke chapter 19 and verse 1.
[52:38] I'd like to speak to you today and I
[52:40] know I won't get done but I want to
[52:43] speak to you today on the atmosphere of
[52:46] change
[52:48] the atmosphere of change
[52:50] amen
[52:56] Hallelujah atmosphere of Change John
[52:59] chapter 3 and verse 2. you have it just
[53:02] say Amen
[53:05] and the same came to Jesus by night and
[53:07] said unto him Rabbi we know that thou
[53:11] art a teacher come from God
[53:14] for no man notice he identifies his life
[53:17] his works for no man can do these
[53:20] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[53:24] with him
[53:25] what a statement isn't it
[53:27] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[53:30] verbally Burly I said unto thee
[53:32] except a man
[53:34] be born again
[53:37] he cannot see the kingdom of God Jesus's
[53:42] first teaching
[53:44] Zacchaeus or in Luke chapter 19 and
[53:48] verse 1.
[53:49] Luke 19 and verse 1. and Jesus entered
[53:53] and passed through Jericho and behold
[53:55] there was a man named Zacchaeus
[53:59] which was a chief among the publicans
[54:01] and he was rich
[54:03] and he sought to see Jesus who was who
[54:06] he was and could not for the Press
[54:09] because he was little in statute
[54:12] and he ran before and climbed up and
[54:15] into a sycamore tree to see him for he
[54:19] was to pass that way
[54:21] and when Jesus came to the place he
[54:23] looked up
[54:24] and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus
[54:28] May taste and come down for today I must
[54:33] abide at thy house
[54:35] and he made haste and came down and
[54:37] received him joyfully now notice the
[54:40] atmosphere of people around him
[54:43] and when they saw it they all murmured
[54:46] saying
[54:47] that he was gone to be a guest with a
[54:50] man that is a sinner
[54:54] well Jesus came to save the sinners
[54:57] didn't come to save righteous but he
[54:59] came to save the Sinners may the Lord
[55:01] bless the reading of his word this today
[55:04] you may be seated
[55:08] huh
[55:13] brother Branham when he was going to go
[55:16] to Mexico
[55:20] there was a there was a a general that
[55:24] had got a touch from the Lord in his
[55:26] ministry
[55:28] and he loved brother Branham and he
[55:29] actually he actually was a great way for
[55:32] brother Branham to get to to Mexico
[55:36] and there was if you remember there was
[55:38] a bishop
[55:39] Mexico being a Catholic country there
[55:42] was a bishop that tried to stop it
[55:45] and so the bishop said that that this
[55:47] man is you know he's not one of us
[55:50] we don't want him here we don't want him
[55:52] preaching to our people and he just
[55:55] basically called him a Beelzebub type of
[55:58] of a minister and and so this General
[56:01] was talking to the bishop and he says
[56:03] you know but he's going to preach and
[56:05] he's been greatly blessed and he'll
[56:07] bless our people and the bishop calls
[56:10] him an ignorant man he'll preach to
[56:12] ignorant people
[56:13] and I thought the general made an
[56:16] incredible statement to him
[56:18] he said you've had them for hundreds of
[56:20] years why are they still ignorant
[56:27] and if you'll notice the meeting takes
[56:29] place and God came to the meeting
[56:33] because if you remember there was a man
[56:35] that was blind
[56:37] brother Adam even makes the statement
[56:39] when he came up that that he he was
[56:42] about the Statue of his father
[56:45] and uh
[56:47] he just loved the atmosphere of our
[56:49] prophet he says he said I looked at him
[56:52] he's about the size of my daddy and he
[56:54] said I slipped up close to him wondering
[56:56] if my coat would fit him brother Branham
[56:59] never weighed over 150 pounds in his
[57:01] life and he said I wondered if my coat
[57:04] would fit him and he said I slid my foot
[57:07] to the side of his foot to see if my
[57:10] shoes would fitting
[57:12] and he and he said
[57:14] he said because love moved him
[57:18] and he began to pray for him and the man
[57:20] was healed
[57:22] we all know this story and we quote it
[57:24] so many times of the that little baby
[57:27] that was a uh that was dead
[57:30] and that morning the mother the baby
[57:33] died of pneumonia
[57:35] and and she had she had taken it to the
[57:38] doctor
[57:40] and the doctors told her just quickly
[57:43] go bury your dead baby
[57:46] well she had saw so many things happen
[57:48] the night before
[57:50] until she had another place to take her
[57:53] baby
[57:55] and she stood in the rain all day with
[57:58] her baby and so she stood there and and
[58:02] she stood there and now there's 300
[58:04] ushers and the the crowd was incredibly
[58:07] huge and and she all she knew was I got
[58:13] to get to that man
[58:15] I just got to get to that man and so she
[58:19] began to press her way through and as
[58:21] she presses her way through she she goes
[58:24] under she goes around she's presses
[58:27] she's not giving up
[58:29] she's not going to the cemetery
[58:34] she's not going to a place to bury her
[58:36] baby she's she's going to get to that
[58:38] man she's determined I think if we could
[58:40] come to church with that kind of
[58:42] determination
[58:45] and and she and she began to press her
[58:48] way through and as she presses her way
[58:50] through and you know she makes her way
[58:52] and Billy Paul you know she's she's
[58:54] she's trying to get on the stage and
[58:56] they're pushing her off of the stage and
[58:58] you know and Billy Paul finally comes to
[59:01] her daddy to to his daddy and says you
[59:03] know and I'm just paraphrasing here
[59:05] Daddy we've got this woman she's made
[59:07] her way through 300 ushers and and she's
[59:10] determined to get to you and and and
[59:12] brother brother Branham turns around to
[59:15] one of the brothers that that is bald
[59:17] headed like himself and about his age
[59:19] and he said she don't know who I am and
[59:22] he said why don't you go pray for her
[59:24] and as he's on his way to pray for he
[59:26] saw the vision
[59:29] and he said just a moment let me pray
[59:33] niece brother brother Billy Paul turns
[59:35] around to him and he says well Daddy
[59:37] Daddy and he says you understand he said
[59:39] I've saw the vision he said yes go to
[59:41] her
[59:42] and so they bring the baby and the baby
[59:44] of course is stiff by now and he's got a
[59:47] blanket over the baby and and as he
[59:50] begins to pray
[59:53] I can imagine what brother branham's own
[59:56] heart being a father
[59:58] being a daddy holding his own children a
[1:00:02] baby that had died in his own life and
[1:00:05] and placed her there with her mother now
[1:00:09] he's holding a dead baby feeling what
[1:00:12] that woman's feeling
[1:00:14] see you can't get anything until you
[1:00:16] have love
[1:00:18] and so and so he he's holding that baby
[1:00:21] and he begins to pray
[1:00:23] and before long he felt that little
[1:00:25] blanket warming up
[1:00:30] he felt that little blanket warming up
[1:00:33] and then it begins to kick a little bit
[1:00:37] that woman handed him a dead baby with
[1:00:40] faith
[1:00:42] and he handed her a baby that was alive
[1:00:47] glory be to God
[1:00:54] I think sometimes when we come to church
[1:00:56] we don't realize that we walked in maybe
[1:00:59] dead and trespasses and sins
[1:01:02] and we walked in one way and then we
[1:01:04] walk out a complete different way
[1:01:08] I want to speak to you about atmosphere
[1:01:11] atmosphere is incredible that's why we
[1:01:13] sing that's why we worship that's why we
[1:01:16] pray
[1:01:17] we pray before church and we ask the
[1:01:19] Lord and we begin to read our scriptures
[1:01:21] and and we begin to talk to God and ask
[1:01:24] him what would you have for us this
[1:01:26] morning
[1:01:27] how would you deal with this this
[1:01:29] morning
[1:01:29] after Friday night's prayer line and I
[1:01:32] was totally exhausted and I was just
[1:01:35] totally wore out and brother Alden was
[1:01:37] so great and sister Tracy was so great
[1:01:39] to drive us down and drive us back from
[1:01:41] North Carolina but I felt the sweetest
[1:01:44] spirit
[1:01:46] when I woke up yesterday morning and I
[1:01:49] was weary and tired and you know and all
[1:01:52] the different kind of blood pressures
[1:01:53] that you've got to deal with and the
[1:01:55] sugar you got to deal with and and I was
[1:01:57] just I just felt the sweetest presence
[1:02:00] and the Lord began to deal with me to
[1:02:02] kind of take some things this morning
[1:02:03] and
[1:02:06] and last night when brother William
[1:02:08] preached I thought what an incredible
[1:02:10] sermon that he spoke last night
[1:02:12] and I'm not going to pray for patience
[1:02:14] but
[1:02:16] I've been through a few things that's
[1:02:18] developed some patience in our lives
[1:02:21] Jesus was standing one day and he was
[1:02:24] preaching and and he's preaching he says
[1:02:27] you're the salt of the earth
[1:02:31] but if the salt has lost its savior
[1:02:33] wherewith it be salted
[1:02:36] since forth good for nothing but to be
[1:02:38] cast out and trodden under the foot of
[1:02:40] men
[1:02:41] and he said ye are the light of the
[1:02:44] world a city that is set on a hill that
[1:02:46] cannot be hid
[1:02:48] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:02:50] under a bushel but on a Candlestick and
[1:02:53] it giveth light unto all that are in the
[1:02:55] house notice the statement now let your
[1:02:59] light so shine before men
[1:03:02] that they may see your good works
[1:03:05] and glorify the Father which is in
[1:03:08] heaven
[1:03:09] you use salt as a preservative
[1:03:12] you are actually preserving your
[1:03:15] community
[1:03:17] you may think that you're not having
[1:03:19] effect but your atmosphere of Jesus
[1:03:23] Christ Living on your tenure Temple
[1:03:25] whether you're at school whether you're
[1:03:28] on a job maybe you work with thousands
[1:03:31] of people at a at a job
[1:03:35] but McKee I'll just take it for instance
[1:03:37] McKee is a blessed company
[1:03:42] I know they're a Christian company but
[1:03:44] they're a blessed company
[1:03:46] because you work there
[1:03:50] and you pray for your job you pray for
[1:03:52] good days
[1:03:54] you pray for an atmosphere around you
[1:03:57] and yet even in that atmosphere you have
[1:04:00] difficult days but what would it be like
[1:04:02] if it wasn't Jesus living there
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:07] I know it doesn't prevent us from having
[1:04:10] difficult days and bad days and
[1:04:12] situations of life
[1:04:15] but let me just say
[1:04:17] we shine our light out
[1:04:21] and maybe you're the only Bible you're
[1:04:23] the only sermon of brother branham's
[1:04:26] that people will ever heal
[1:04:28] you don't have to preach people a sermon
[1:04:30] just live people a sermon
[1:04:35] sometimes when we first get saved we
[1:04:38] think that we've got to be legalists
[1:04:39] with everybody
[1:04:41] well everybody ain't got what you got
[1:04:43] so you got to remember God's working on
[1:04:46] you not necessarily on them
[1:04:50] and you'll come through that stage where
[1:04:52] God cleans your life up and washes your
[1:04:55] life up and after a while you can begin
[1:04:57] to have Grace for other people
[1:05:00] because God had Grace for you
[1:05:04] I'm really glad of that when brother
[1:05:06] Brandon preaches when he preaches the
[1:05:08] future home
[1:05:09] which is about a four-hour sermon but
[1:05:12] the about the first 40 minutes
[1:05:15] brother Branham spends time on and I
[1:05:18] think it's incredibly important even to
[1:05:20] mention here this morning he says I want
[1:05:22] to thank all the people that have
[1:05:24] gathered in for the meeting he said
[1:05:26] you're staying in the hotels and you're
[1:05:28] going to the restaurants many times it
[1:05:31] was even the population of
[1:05:33] Jeffersonville would grow by quite a few
[1:05:35] because of people attending the meeting
[1:05:38] they travel from all over the United
[1:05:40] States when they knew that brother
[1:05:42] Branham was going to be preaching
[1:05:44] they stood outside by the hundreds when
[1:05:48] brother Branham would preach you know we
[1:05:50] may have difficulty with somebody
[1:05:51] getting their seat but can you imagine
[1:05:53] getting there three three and four hours
[1:05:56] early trying to get in the door then you
[1:05:58] can't get in the door and now you listen
[1:06:01] to the you listen to the sermon maybe by
[1:06:03] the radio or by by the speakers outside
[1:06:06] and you stand there attentively listen
[1:06:09] to the prophet of God
[1:06:12] like future home four hour sermon
[1:06:16] but in the first 40 to 45 minutes and I
[1:06:20] don't know the exact number there
[1:06:21] brother Brandon begins to talk about
[1:06:23] those that are in the hotel those that
[1:06:26] are in the restaurants and he has talked
[1:06:28] to the owners and the managers and
[1:06:31] they're so complementary of what a
[1:06:34] special life that they have how nice the
[1:06:37] people are that comes to your meeting
[1:06:39] how cordial they are they're just better
[1:06:42] than any of the world out there they're
[1:06:44] just such a nice people
[1:06:46] brother random is very attentive to that
[1:06:48] maybe people got impatience when he's
[1:06:51] talking about that but you see the bride
[1:06:53] gets their change here
[1:06:57] you see the the change isn't going to
[1:06:59] happen in the rapture
[1:07:01] your body will change but but your
[1:07:04] character changes here
[1:07:07] your life the token the manifestation of
[1:07:10] the life of God happens here
[1:07:13] and it's on display to laodicea that
[1:07:16] it's taking place in her life because
[1:07:18] we're going to a place
[1:07:22] we're going to a place where there's no
[1:07:24] Liars there's no cheaters there's no
[1:07:26] fornicators there's no adulterers
[1:07:28] there's no homosexualities there's no
[1:07:31] politics
[1:07:39] oh that's enough to shout right there
[1:07:40] isn't it
[1:07:42] you see our atmosphere has to change
[1:07:44] here
[1:07:46] and that's why you've got to have God's
[1:07:48] love you know you're born with a certain
[1:07:50] amount of love and patience and and
[1:07:52] virtue and all of those things that go
[1:07:54] all the way up to to brotherly kindness
[1:07:56] you're born with that stature perfect
[1:07:58] man by your natural DNA but when the
[1:08:02] Holy Ghost comes in your life
[1:08:05] he gives you a Godly love he gives you a
[1:08:08] Godly patience
[1:08:10] he gives you a Godly strength he gives
[1:08:13] you a Godly brotherly kindness in your
[1:08:16] life
[1:08:18] are you with me because before you
[1:08:20] couldn't love your enemy
[1:08:25] before you had a temper that would fight
[1:08:27] a bus song before you were stubborn as a
[1:08:31] mule
[1:08:33] he's still working on all of us now
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:39] but the Holy Ghost comes in and
[1:08:41] saturates your life and now you can you
[1:08:44] can love your wife you can love your
[1:08:45] husband like never before
[1:08:48] you can love one another like never
[1:08:50] before
[1:08:51] and if you've truly got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:54] you can Overlook one another's mistakes
[1:09:00] oh brother Ron Christians make mistakes
[1:09:03] Welcome to the Real World
[1:09:07] [Applause]
[1:09:17] I think it's incredible
[1:09:20] that brother Branham goes to
[1:09:23] especially Topeka in 1964 Full Gospel
[1:09:27] businessman caused some of the men's
[1:09:29] name they're powerful men that's in the
[1:09:31] Full Gospel businessman calls others
[1:09:34] names there and
[1:09:35] maybe they're looking for him to preach
[1:09:37] something incredibly complex
[1:09:40] maybe something deep
[1:09:43] maybe something mind-shattering
[1:09:47] and he preaches a sermon called who is
[1:09:49] Jesus
[1:09:51] and he takes a text to wear that
[1:09:55] that to where that he begins to talk
[1:09:58] about a man named zacchus
[1:10:00] now he Compares this businessman that's
[1:10:04] rich
[1:10:04] and has great standing in the city and
[1:10:07] they don't know it but he's actually
[1:10:09] talking about the people in the pew
[1:10:13] and now he takes this man and he says
[1:10:15] his wife has been around Jesus and his
[1:10:18] disciples and she's now a follower of
[1:10:21] Jesus but her husband is an unbeliever
[1:10:24] and she would like for her husband to
[1:10:27] get near Jesus
[1:10:30] you know a lot of times and I want to
[1:10:32] really I want to push this point now you
[1:10:35] can't educate anybody into Jesus
[1:10:41] you can't intellectually give speeches
[1:10:43] into Jesus
[1:10:45] but if you can come and see
[1:10:49] if you can come and see in the
[1:10:51] atmosphere
[1:10:54] you say oh brother Ron atmosphere is not
[1:10:56] important well if you went out on a date
[1:10:58] with your wife
[1:11:00] and you go to a special place and
[1:11:01] they've got those yeah you know what I'm
[1:11:03] talking about and they've got that they
[1:11:05] got that white table covering and in the
[1:11:08] middle they got flowers and and you know
[1:11:10] they got they got candles lit up they
[1:11:13] turn the lights down a little bit to
[1:11:14] where you can't see the food
[1:11:18] and there's music playing behind you
[1:11:21] that's atmosphere
[1:11:23] and whether you know it or not you're
[1:11:24] going to pay for it at the end of the
[1:11:25] trip
[1:11:28] and that's why atmosphere in the church
[1:11:30] is so important
[1:11:34] it is so important
[1:11:36] and maybe you know maybe you get a
[1:11:38] grievance with one another maybe you
[1:11:40] pick a fight with one another maybe
[1:11:41] husband and wife would just kind of be
[1:11:44] on the way to church and and you come to
[1:11:47] church and you know I got to get to
[1:11:49] church because I need God
[1:11:52] and you know you that's why we come in
[1:11:55] and we sit down and we begin to pray
[1:12:00] because there's somebody else's coming
[1:12:02] that may not know the Lord
[1:12:04] and we want an atmosphere all through
[1:12:07] this church
[1:12:09] how many people have told me when they
[1:12:11] first come here when I walk through the
[1:12:13] doors I felt something I never felt
[1:12:15] before
[1:12:18] Jesus ate 10 million miles away
[1:12:21] he's more than a pitcher on the wall but
[1:12:24] I want him to Electrify the atmosphere
[1:12:27] at this building that's what I pray
[1:12:30] I want to Electrify the atmosphere of
[1:12:33] this building
[1:12:38] I want these children to know that that
[1:12:40] process is coming to them it's the
[1:12:43] presence of the Lord
[1:12:46] I don't want these children to think
[1:12:48] that they're being made to serve the
[1:12:50] Lord I want them to fall in love with
[1:12:52] Jesus
[1:12:59] you know I think he said let's just have
[1:13:01] a little drama
[1:13:04] and as these little drama goes he
[1:13:06] you can go listen to it but I just want
[1:13:08] to give a couple highlights here
[1:13:10] he said he slipped out of bed early in
[1:13:12] the morning
[1:13:13] and he put on the best clothes that he
[1:13:15] had
[1:13:16] best clothes
[1:13:18] and as he slips out of bed he he tries
[1:13:20] to be real quiet
[1:13:22] because he don't want to wake Rebecca I
[1:13:24] wonder where brother Brian come up with
[1:13:25] that one
[1:13:29] Eve had blonde hair I'm sure brother bam
[1:13:31] knew Rebecca's name
[1:13:33] and so he slips out of bed he slips
[1:13:35] across and said she's awake so what she
[1:13:39] does is she looks out of the covers and
[1:13:41] watches him or is he going this early in
[1:13:44] the morning
[1:13:45] said after a little while she asked him
[1:13:47] said where are you going oh I'm going
[1:13:49] for a walk in his best clothes
[1:13:54] and he begins to go for a walk and you
[1:13:57] know he's heard about Jesus and he wants
[1:14:00] to prove but you know maybe maybe he
[1:14:02] he's not right
[1:14:05] and he's going maybe with a you know I
[1:14:07] wonder what he's all about
[1:14:09] but he figures out that he can't get to
[1:14:12] him
[1:14:14] because Jesus has got a crowd around him
[1:14:17] and you know he
[1:14:19] brother Brandon says he said he said you
[1:14:22] know he said when they were coming
[1:14:24] toward him he said he knew Jesus was
[1:14:27] coming because they were singing
[1:14:29] and he said they were singing and they
[1:14:31] were screaming
[1:14:34] he may have enjoyed this church
[1:14:38] because president said wherever Jesus is
[1:14:41] a whole lot of noise
[1:14:50] he begins to make his way and and you
[1:14:53] know what he he can't get up in the tree
[1:14:55] I think it's interesting that the
[1:14:57] prophet said well he grabbed a trash can
[1:15:01] and he got up on top of it and fell in
[1:15:03] it
[1:15:07] he got trash all over him speak all over
[1:15:09] him and stuff all over him and he
[1:15:11] finally got himself up into the tree
[1:15:12] because he was too short to see and he
[1:15:15] got up in the tree but now he's ashamed
[1:15:17] of himself
[1:15:19] and then when he sees his neighbors and
[1:15:21] the Joneses coming up and their baby has
[1:15:24] been healed and then another one has
[1:15:26] been healed and another one begins to
[1:15:28] get healed and now his critical spirit
[1:15:30] is softening up
[1:15:33] his critical spirit is softening up now
[1:15:36] and you know he's not so tough against
[1:15:39] Jesus
[1:15:40] and as he begins to come up and and
[1:15:43] Jesus stops under the tree
[1:15:48] listen there's hundreds of people maybe
[1:15:50] even thousands of people
[1:15:52] good bad ugly critics religious people
[1:15:56] great people that you know maybe even
[1:15:58] people that are pretty strong with the
[1:16:01] city that might might be able to
[1:16:02] entertain him real well and he stops
[1:16:05] under the tree and he looks up
[1:16:09] and he said Zacchaeus knew his name
[1:16:13] come down out of the tree make haste
[1:16:17] come down out of the tree today I'm
[1:16:20] going to have dinner with you
[1:16:24] I want to spend a little time with you
[1:16:26] let me just say this year if you will
[1:16:28] just take the time to spend with Jesus a
[1:16:32] little while
[1:16:35] a lot of people are critical of a lot of
[1:16:37] things maybe one another until they
[1:16:40] actually discover what they're all about
[1:16:45] you know I've had people talk to me
[1:16:46] about others not necessarily here talk
[1:16:49] to me about others and I just I just
[1:16:51] answer them with this so you don't know
[1:16:53] them very well
[1:16:56] you wouldn't be so critical if you
[1:16:58] really knew them or knew their
[1:17:01] background or where they came from
[1:17:10] you see life is not a still picture
[1:17:14] it's not a still picture what you saw in
[1:17:17] a person at 22 years old is not what
[1:17:20] they are at 45
[1:17:23] how many of you once in a while will
[1:17:25] look back at your old pictures and there
[1:17:28] you are slender at your wedding
[1:17:32] you're standing there in your white
[1:17:34] tuxedo and Green Bay Packer socks on
[1:17:37] showing through
[1:17:39] you don't know that guy's gonna be a
[1:17:41] preacher one day
[1:17:43] then you see him a few years later and
[1:17:46] his hair started to not be read anymore
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:17:51] then after a while you may have hurt him
[1:17:53] as a young preacher and you know he was
[1:17:56] just like another young preacher in this
[1:17:58] church 100 miles an hour
[1:18:02] dancing all over the building and then
[1:18:05] when he gets about 60 quietens down a
[1:18:07] little bit
[1:18:10] I told Brother Alden on the way to
[1:18:12] church the other night on Thursday night
[1:18:14] I said I'm going to Pace myself
[1:18:17] brother Homer told me said you're old
[1:18:19] enough now to take care of yourself a
[1:18:21] little bit
[1:18:22] we got out of church and brother Alden
[1:18:25] just looked at me he's a gentleman he
[1:18:27] said well that's a pretty quick pace
[1:18:30] [Applause]
[1:18:41] aren't you glad Life's a movie and not
[1:18:43] it's still picture
[1:18:46] now
[1:18:48] immediately people begin to say
[1:18:51] this man's a sinner
[1:18:52] why is Jesus
[1:18:55] if he is Messiah why is Jesus going to
[1:18:59] spend the afternoon
[1:19:01] with a man like Zacchaeus
[1:19:05] well when Jesus goes there he don't have
[1:19:08] to preach a sermon to it
[1:19:10] he don't have to tell him how bad it is
[1:19:12] but before the evening's over Zacchaeus
[1:19:16] is a different man
[1:19:18] and Zacchaeus has done a lot of dirty
[1:19:20] things in his life before the evening's
[1:19:23] over the atmosphere of Jesus is making
[1:19:27] him want to make restitution to
[1:19:29] everybody that he did wrong
[1:19:31] repent to everybody around him
[1:19:38] sometimes let me just bring it up to
[1:19:40] date sometimes you think
[1:19:43] why was brother Branham with a man named
[1:19:46] Bert call
[1:19:48] who called he called Old lizard eyes the
[1:19:51] most wicked man that he ever met
[1:19:56] of all the people that brother Branham
[1:19:58] could have went hunting with
[1:20:00] have you ever thought about the woman at
[1:20:02] the well
[1:20:05] Jesus went out of his way sent the
[1:20:07] disciples away
[1:20:09] and this woman would immediately begin
[1:20:11] to respond difficult things to Jesus but
[1:20:14] Jesus knew she had a predestinated seat
[1:20:18] listen at the end of the story with
[1:20:20] brother Branham and Bert call Bert call
[1:20:22] has given his heart to the Lord
[1:20:28] what an atmosphere even honey
[1:20:33] even hunting well brother on that's just
[1:20:35] an isolated incident well
[1:20:38] they couldn't find any squirrel in in a
[1:20:42] couple of different sets of wood so so
[1:20:44] the woods is brother Woods said I I Know
[1:20:47] a Man over here now brother Brandon you
[1:20:49] stayed in the car because this man's an
[1:20:51] Infidel he's a difficult old guy
[1:20:53] and brother man I'm seeing the
[1:20:55] difficulty that was going on and you
[1:20:57] know finally brother Woods says uh I got
[1:21:00] a preacher with me
[1:21:02] and and the Infidel said do you mean to
[1:21:04] tell me that you're so low to you have
[1:21:06] to haul a preacher around
[1:21:10] brother Brown didn't go up and tell him
[1:21:12] it didn't give him no Mysteries he
[1:21:15] didn't tell him who he was
[1:21:19] he said can I have an apple
[1:21:22] all the yellow jackets are eating them
[1:21:24] up
[1:21:25] you might as well have one
[1:21:27] picks it up and he said I see the leaves
[1:21:31] are turning up here and it's August
[1:21:33] it's not fall yet
[1:21:36] wonder what intelligence is telling that
[1:21:38] tree to protect the roots
[1:21:41] that's not the seals
[1:21:44] that's not the godhead
[1:21:46] it's atmosphere
[1:21:50] and the man's talking about to him a
[1:21:52] little bit
[1:21:53] and then the man says Ah Ah there's one
[1:21:56] preacher I'd like to meet
[1:21:58] there's a lady up on the hill she was
[1:22:00] dying
[1:22:02] she was dying and and at one of her
[1:22:04] family members went to a meeting
[1:22:06] and and they came home with a prayer
[1:22:08] cloth and laid it on her and and that
[1:22:10] woman got healed and it was at night
[1:22:12] when they came back and there was awful
[1:22:14] this amount of shouting and everything
[1:22:15] and I told the wife in the morning we'll
[1:22:17] go up there with the buck board and
[1:22:19] we'll bring her down off of the off
[1:22:21] there and help them out and he said when
[1:22:23] we got up there
[1:22:24] they told me about the meeting and they
[1:22:26] told me how that that preacher prayed
[1:22:28] for her and she got healed
[1:22:33] are you with me now he said I'd like to
[1:22:35] meet that Preacher Brother Branham
[1:22:37] didn't tell him that he was the man
[1:22:42] he didn't tell him he was the man he
[1:22:44] talked about the intelligence of what's
[1:22:46] making that that fluid that sack going
[1:22:49] up and down in that tree
[1:22:52] and at the end of the conversation when
[1:22:55] we get back from hunting if you can tell
[1:22:57] me what intelligence that is of telling
[1:23:00] that sap to go back down I'll tell you
[1:23:02] what intelligence that was that told me
[1:23:04] about that woman
[1:23:08] and that Infidel that been that way for
[1:23:10] now late decades
[1:23:13] and was proud of being an infidel
[1:23:17] before the day was over that atmosphere
[1:23:20] that had came into his yard
[1:23:25] had so changed his life till now he
[1:23:28] becomes a Christian
[1:23:32] brother man shows back up the next year
[1:23:34] to go hunting there in the and the lady
[1:23:36] says she wants to run him off and he
[1:23:39] said well I'm I'm sorry I hunted here
[1:23:41] last year
[1:23:43] she said are are you Branham
[1:23:46] yeah
[1:23:49] and then she begins to tell him the
[1:23:50] testimony
[1:23:53] of how her husband became a real
[1:23:55] Christian
[1:23:59] how many people walked in that yard
[1:24:02] lacking that atmosphere
[1:24:07] I'd like to say this to you
[1:24:10] I want that in my life like never before
[1:24:16] I'm sure in brother Brandon's media when
[1:24:18] he begins to explain zacchus come down
[1:24:19] out of the tree
[1:24:22] no doubt some of the people that were
[1:24:24] sitting there begin to realize he's not
[1:24:27] talking about Zach just two thousand
[1:24:28] years ago
[1:24:31] he's talking about me
[1:24:33] sometimes when you're sitting in church
[1:24:35] and all of a sudden there's a story
[1:24:37] being told and a story over here being
[1:24:38] told and a story they're more than
[1:24:40] stories
[1:24:44] they're more than stories somebody in
[1:24:46] the building
[1:24:47] when I was in Edmonton on Friday night I
[1:24:50] began to I began or Saturday night I
[1:24:52] began to just stop and begin to tell
[1:24:54] testimonies after testimonies then in
[1:24:57] the prayer line
[1:24:59] every testimony that I told
[1:25:03] somebody walked through with that need
[1:25:09] I can't do that
[1:25:12] I can't put that together but a greater
[1:25:16] than Solomon
[1:25:18] is still in the building
[1:25:21] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:25:24] forever
[1:25:27] says therefore if your conversation is
[1:25:29] only because your your conversion is
[1:25:31] only because you're trying to hide
[1:25:33] behind something or trying to make
[1:25:35] yourself a better person
[1:25:37] you're only playing a part of a
[1:25:39] hypocrite
[1:25:40] until Christ has actually came into your
[1:25:44] life and changed you and brought you
[1:25:48] into an atmosphere
[1:25:50] that's the difference to it
[1:25:53] and a man and woman ever walked into the
[1:25:55] Shekinah Glory of God the whole world
[1:25:58] shuts off behind him and no matter what
[1:26:01] the devil says you don't pay no
[1:26:03] attention to that
[1:26:04] he's living I love this he's living in a
[1:26:09] different atmosphere
[1:26:12] I don't want to drop this tonight he
[1:26:14] says now gifts is no good
[1:26:18] unless you're abiding in the Shekinah
[1:26:21] Glory
[1:26:25] I love that don't you
[1:26:27] Jesus says no man can come unto me
[1:26:30] except my father draws me
[1:26:32] let me just say this to you when God
[1:26:34] begins to draw no doubt many
[1:26:37] want to resist and go a different
[1:26:39] direction
[1:26:40] your first husband the world your first
[1:26:42] nature don't want to die
[1:26:46] and listen education or or just trying
[1:26:49] to work your way into the a conversion
[1:26:51] that won't work
[1:26:54] many of us just made vows I'm going to
[1:26:56] not dress this way anymore I'm not going
[1:26:58] to act this way anymore I'm not going to
[1:27:00] do this no more now listen let me just
[1:27:02] say it there's something about fishing
[1:27:05] preaching and fishing Works a whole lot
[1:27:07] the same
[1:27:08] you don't bear clean a fish before you
[1:27:10] get it in the boat
[1:27:14] and sometimes as Christians it takes
[1:27:17] years to clean fish
[1:27:21] you can preach as hard as you want to on
[1:27:24] certain subjects
[1:27:25] but if as a man pulls something off of
[1:27:28] your life the devil will put it right
[1:27:30] back on
[1:27:31] but if you can get the atmosphere of
[1:27:33] Jesus Christ into your life
[1:27:36] if you can get that into your life
[1:27:39] your
[1:27:41] your parents no no doubt was resistant
[1:27:43] to what you're doing sitting here
[1:27:45] but you came in this atmosphere
[1:27:50] you came to church and you begin to feel
[1:27:53] it for yourself
[1:27:55] listen it's got to be personal
[1:27:58] it's got to be personal between you and
[1:28:02] God
[1:28:04] this message is more than about laws and
[1:28:06] do's and don'ts and deep deep cleaned
[1:28:09] with doctrines and and reveal word of
[1:28:12] the hour it's the life of Jesus Christ
[1:28:16] it's not an additional Bible for you to
[1:28:19] believe it's actually the glasses for
[1:28:21] you to read
[1:28:24] World wants to put you in certain jobs
[1:28:26] and trash because you've got something
[1:28:28] they can't find
[1:28:40] how do you get children like this God
[1:28:43] does it
[1:28:45] listen we don't make them do this God
[1:28:48] does it in their lives and before long
[1:28:51] there's a love
[1:28:53] the prophet talks about he says a woman
[1:28:56] was married to a man that beat her and
[1:28:58] all these different kind of things that
[1:29:00] she she did a lot of things for him
[1:29:03] but it was a grudgery to do things for
[1:29:05] him that man died and she married a man
[1:29:09] that she absolutely loved and adored and
[1:29:12] she found herself doing the same things
[1:29:15] for him but now she'd love to do it
[1:29:22] are you with me coming to church if you
[1:29:26] can fall in love with it
[1:29:29] you can fall in love let me just say
[1:29:31] nobody has to convince you to come to
[1:29:33] church
[1:29:35] I'm not going to call you if you miss I
[1:29:37] I I'm not going to call you I'm sorry
[1:29:39] you stay on a while I'll finally call
[1:29:41] you and say are you dead
[1:29:44] but let me just say this I want you to
[1:29:46] have a love
[1:29:49] I love to come here I love to serve God
[1:29:52] I love for one another
[1:29:59] a Christian cannot be a Christian
[1:30:02] until Christ comes into that man and
[1:30:05] then it's the life of Jesus Christ on
[1:30:09] the inside of it then it produces the
[1:30:11] life that Christ lived the same life
[1:30:14] that Christ lived and you do the things
[1:30:17] that Christ did
[1:30:20] Christians oh you must have a personal
[1:30:23] relationship to God in order to be a Son
[1:30:26] of God you must become a relation to God
[1:30:30] he must be your father in order to be
[1:30:32] his son
[1:30:33] and you and sons and daughters are saved
[1:30:37] not members of a church but Sons and
[1:30:40] Daughters there's only one thing that
[1:30:42] will produce that and that's the new
[1:30:45] birth
[1:30:46] and the new birth is only thing that
[1:30:49] will produce a personal relationship
[1:30:51] with God
[1:30:54] I love that don't you
[1:30:56] he says now the holy spirit is not a
[1:31:00] cesspool
[1:31:03] no no no no no no
[1:31:05] he said that heart is occupied by the
[1:31:08] Holy Spirit it is full of Holiness and
[1:31:11] Purity It quotes the scripture think of
[1:31:14] no evil doeth no evil believeth all
[1:31:16] things endureth on long-suffering God
[1:31:19] won't live in a cesspool
[1:31:24] are you with me you can't be in love
[1:31:26] with the world and in love with God at
[1:31:28] the same time
[1:31:33] now he says if a pig wants to stick his
[1:31:35] nuts snouter in a manure pile
[1:31:38] and eat all day that's his business
[1:31:41] because he's a pig to begin with
[1:31:44] but a lamb doesn't do that
[1:31:47] The Sinner
[1:31:49] he's a pig to begin with but but when
[1:31:51] you try to make a lamb out of a pig
[1:31:55] he has to have a conversion
[1:31:58] he has to have a different atmosphere
[1:32:00] and when it comes into that atmosphere
[1:32:03] his desires change
[1:32:06] his nature will change
[1:32:09] that's the way it is today
[1:32:12] he said then when you become a son and
[1:32:14] daughter of God your disposition changes
[1:32:17] your attitude changes
[1:32:20] your look towards life changes it
[1:32:23] doesn't mean that you just have to join
[1:32:25] a church it means that you have been
[1:32:27] regenerated
[1:32:29] and you'll become a new creation in
[1:32:32] Jesus Christ
[1:32:34] old things have passed away
[1:32:37] and God has spoken to you and you have
[1:32:40] become a new creature
[1:32:42] he said I want to go to down not being a
[1:32:45] church member but I want to be a new
[1:32:47] creature in Christ Jesus
[1:32:51] I love that don't you
[1:32:54] he's Ezekiel speaks about it
[1:32:58] that got to give you a new spirit
[1:33:02] and he says God has to change your
[1:33:04] original spirit
[1:33:06] brother I said now that's not the Holy
[1:33:08] Ghost
[1:33:09] he said he's got to change your spirit
[1:33:14] to where he can live with you
[1:33:18] I love that don't you he has to change
[1:33:20] your spirit to where he can live with
[1:33:23] you and then he gives you the Holy
[1:33:25] Spirit
[1:33:28] now my grandmother
[1:33:31] whom I dearly loved
[1:33:36] she was widowed at 43 years old
[1:33:39] so she became and it was in a very
[1:33:41] difficult time
[1:33:43] waited at 43 years old and
[1:33:46] and my grandfather was a Christian the
[1:33:48] last five years of his life but the
[1:33:50] damage had already been done
[1:33:52] he had been a drunk he owned five Farms
[1:33:56] he'd been quite a worker
[1:33:58] but he but he made moonshine
[1:34:01] and some of his moonshine would get him
[1:34:03] to where that he was his eyes would
[1:34:05] actually turn solid white
[1:34:07] and it would poison him later would
[1:34:10] cause cancer in his life
[1:34:12] but anyway he was 10 years older than my
[1:34:15] grandmother
[1:34:16] he took butcher knives to her
[1:34:18] he beat her
[1:34:20] she was just a piece of his property
[1:34:23] he tried to burn the house down with my
[1:34:25] mom and and Ronnie inside of it with my
[1:34:28] grandmother
[1:34:29] he pushed my grandmother down a set of
[1:34:32] steps about 15 Steps down pushed her
[1:34:35] down them steps and she rolled like a
[1:34:37] ball
[1:34:39] and those were difficult conversations
[1:34:42] for her to bring back up so she became a
[1:34:45] woman that was very defensive
[1:34:50] and and you know her language was not
[1:34:52] good
[1:34:55] I'm saying that very kindly here
[1:34:58] her language was not good I've told you
[1:35:01] how that she could
[1:35:02] in her stubbornness she could have a
[1:35:05] little you know deal with you tiff with
[1:35:07] you and then she could live in the same
[1:35:09] house bedroom right right to next to
[1:35:11] your bedroom and she wouldn't speak to
[1:35:13] you for two weeks
[1:35:15] same table
[1:35:20] God had to give her a new spirit
[1:35:24] he had to give her a new spirit
[1:35:26] then he had to give her the Holy Ghost
[1:35:30] now she got converted she came to church
[1:35:33] she did real well but that old nature
[1:35:36] would show up on him
[1:35:38] my little boys was playing one time and
[1:35:41] they were they were playing in the Pew
[1:35:43] and you know kids are kids try to do
[1:35:45] your best with your children
[1:35:47] thank God we got we got kids here and if
[1:35:50] they get a little noisy you know take
[1:35:52] them out
[1:35:53] we're not going to beat him to death
[1:35:54] please don't beat him to death
[1:35:56] but anyway take care of them train up
[1:35:59] your child train them to come to church
[1:36:01] train them behave
[1:36:03] but my little boys were they were
[1:36:05] playing
[1:36:06] and and you know they were doing a
[1:36:08] little dancing
[1:36:10] well the Deacon was pretty legalist
[1:36:13] he may listen to this but he was pretty
[1:36:16] legalist
[1:36:17] and so he was getting all over Connie
[1:36:20] and it went real well because Connie's
[1:36:22] got a really nice spirit to her
[1:36:25] my grandmother was sitting just across
[1:36:28] the way
[1:36:31] she took him by the arm
[1:36:36] and she walked him out of church
[1:36:41] I would later ask her what did you tell
[1:36:44] him she said I needed more of Jesus
[1:36:54] since we're all Angels here
[1:36:58] she said I gave him a good cussing
[1:37:13] I'm not proud of that I want you to know
[1:37:15] that I'm not proud of that
[1:37:17] but let me just say this to you we can
[1:37:21] look back to where she was
[1:37:25] but God changed your life and
[1:37:27] transformed her life and for the last
[1:37:29] years she was a real dedicated Christian
[1:37:32] read all the message books she went
[1:37:34] through it she could quote it right back
[1:37:36] to you
[1:37:39] but you see God has to work on us
[1:37:43] now this isn't a learned behavior
[1:37:46] [Music]
[1:37:47] this isn't something that we work our
[1:37:49] way into it it's an atmosphere that has
[1:37:52] to come into our home and into our
[1:37:54] church and at our Pew and at our life
[1:37:56] we've got to create an atmosphere to
[1:37:59] welcome him
[1:38:03] are you with me now that atmosphere has
[1:38:05] to be there to welcome him I'll wash his
[1:38:08] feet I'll worship Him
[1:38:11] I'm going to lay down my pride I'm going
[1:38:13] to lay down everything around me I want
[1:38:15] to create an atmosphere at this pew
[1:38:18] you're not responsible for the next few
[1:38:25] you're not responsible for another
[1:38:26] church I'm not responsible for another
[1:38:28] church
[1:38:31] I'm not here to straighten anybody out
[1:38:33] let me just say I'm just going to preach
[1:38:34] the word and where the shoe fits just
[1:38:36] put it on it'll be okay
[1:38:41] it's going to be like Lazarus take off
[1:38:43] his clothes take off his grave clothes
[1:38:44] he's going to live for a little while
[1:38:48] he's not going to stay in a grave
[1:38:50] atmosphere he's going to live for a
[1:38:51] while
[1:38:53] now let me just
[1:38:56] well my time's from now
[1:38:57] but let me just say this to you
[1:39:00] it's hard for me to imagine as I read
[1:39:02] history
[1:39:03] in an age of Martyrs
[1:39:07] to where people would be under that age
[1:39:10] of the ox
[1:39:12] to where they would actually be
[1:39:14] persecuted to death
[1:39:18] and they would have such a revelation
[1:39:20] they would have an atmosphere to where
[1:39:22] they would willingly give their life
[1:39:25] me and you're not there we're not in
[1:39:27] that age
[1:39:29] are you with me now
[1:39:31] thank God
[1:39:33] to walk to a home the soldiers walked to
[1:39:35] a home and begin to collect children and
[1:39:38] for a mother to say I've got one more
[1:39:39] hit back here
[1:39:43] they had to have a revelation that when
[1:39:46] that child perished they went
[1:39:47] immediately into heaven
[1:39:50] there was a long line of of of of of a
[1:39:54] people the soldiers were taking their
[1:39:56] life
[1:39:57] and a man sees the situation going on
[1:39:59] and now it's becoming his turn and he
[1:40:01] says I give up I recant I I just can't
[1:40:04] do it and the soldier says
[1:40:07] let me take your place
[1:40:12] you take my life
[1:40:15] because as I see these people as the
[1:40:19] sword goes through them
[1:40:21] Angels pick them up and take them into
[1:40:25] heaven
[1:40:26] I've stood here and witnessed it by the
[1:40:28] hundreds and that Soldier took off his
[1:40:32] his Soldier outfit and stood there in
[1:40:35] that man's place and gave his life to
[1:40:37] Jesus Christ
[1:40:39] brother on that's just one story they
[1:40:42] had a they had a group of Believers
[1:40:43] about a hundred out by an ice field
[1:40:46] right near a lake they stripped him down
[1:40:49] into no clothes at all standing there
[1:40:51] naked and they stood there and sang
[1:40:55] man and rejoiced
[1:40:59] while they were perishing and finally
[1:41:02] one man says I just can't take it I give
[1:41:05] up
[1:41:06] and one of the guards said here put
[1:41:08] these clothes on he pulled his clothes
[1:41:10] off
[1:41:12] because of the atmosphere of those
[1:41:14] believers
[1:41:16] even while they perished
[1:41:18] he got under conviction and he said I
[1:41:21] want to have a Jesus like that in my
[1:41:24] life
[1:41:27] listen we're getting ready for rapture
[1:41:30] who will we influence before the coming
[1:41:33] of the Lord
[1:41:36] who will be we be the life to before the
[1:41:38] coming of the lord we just had a
[1:41:40] missionary conference we just had an
[1:41:42] incredible meeting there listen it's not
[1:41:45] about going to Zimbabwe or going to
[1:41:47] South America or going listen God's
[1:41:49] raised up people in all those Nations
[1:41:51] and we've sent books and helped build
[1:41:53] build churches throughout the years
[1:41:57] we as a church have sent
[1:41:59] I'm not going to say incredible amounts
[1:42:02] of money to try to help
[1:42:03] listen that last one's going to come in
[1:42:06] and then we're going to go home
[1:42:09] that's what we're going to do
[1:42:11] but your mission field is right where
[1:42:14] you're at
[1:42:17] you don't have to preach a person a
[1:42:19] sermon live it
[1:42:22] live it
[1:42:24] they may never read a book they may
[1:42:26] never listen to a tape but they may say
[1:42:28] if I ever met a Christian that's the man
[1:42:31] that's the woman
[1:42:35] [Applause]
[1:42:47] why did we get requests from from
[1:42:49] everywhere
[1:42:51] people that are not Christians
[1:42:53] will you pray for this situation is a
[1:42:55] dire situation
[1:42:57] they see something in you
[1:43:00] they see something in you
[1:43:05] our young fellow that's in Canada right
[1:43:07] now
[1:43:11] after I got burned
[1:43:14] brother biscoll
[1:43:16] had told sister Connie I think I told it
[1:43:18] here the last time I was
[1:43:19] preaching here that brother biscoll
[1:43:22] had called when I was dying that I would
[1:43:25] be the speaker at Mount Baker camp
[1:43:27] 15 years ago maybe
[1:43:30] 16 years ago
[1:43:32] I would be the speaker at Mount Baker
[1:43:34] Camp next year my mom and dad went all
[1:43:37] my children went never forget it we were
[1:43:40] in a huge tent they still operate in
[1:43:42] that huge tent well anyway
[1:43:44] sister Katie was sitting on the very
[1:43:46] back with Andrew
[1:43:48] and Andrew has confessed to us over and
[1:43:50] over again he needed more of the Lord
[1:43:52] and you know it
[1:43:54] and so
[1:43:56] while I was preaching Katie got to
[1:43:59] screaming
[1:44:00] Tom after your service asked me he said
[1:44:02] does she do that all the time I said
[1:44:05] she's never done it before
[1:44:08] she had never did it before she'd done
[1:44:10] it now
[1:44:12] but she'd never done it before but in
[1:44:14] that atmosphere
[1:44:17] in that atmosphere her life changed
[1:44:20] well Andrew was still a sneaker
[1:44:25] so we go for a couple of days at
[1:44:27] Victoria kind of for a little time off
[1:44:30] I want to talk to you now I'm going to
[1:44:32] come to an end
[1:44:33] finish this maybe next week
[1:44:36] the same day you can't make this up
[1:44:39] brother Tom Ray's son Joel
[1:44:42] you know he's in the world he's doing
[1:44:44] things he shouldn't be doing mom and
[1:44:46] dad's praying they're desperately
[1:44:48] praying for him they're praying like
[1:44:50] never before that he gets saved because
[1:44:52] he's going out in the world and things
[1:44:54] are going on you know now you know
[1:44:56] they've got a covenant with God God gave
[1:44:58] him their boys because they couldn't
[1:45:00] have children and every time they went
[1:45:01] before the Lord can we have one more and
[1:45:04] God gave them even Joe
[1:45:06] well Joel
[1:45:09] Joel would you know he had he had that
[1:45:11] he was a pretty boy he had a long
[1:45:13] beautiful black curly hair he actually
[1:45:16] came here one time and
[1:45:18] he was good looking boy he wasn't quite
[1:45:21] as tall and but he was dark and handsome
[1:45:28] I'll never forget it sister Connie I
[1:45:30] never forget it
[1:45:32] but I probably can't grow a beard anyway
[1:45:34] because I'm a part Indian Apache
[1:45:48] it'll be all right Sister Nancy
[1:45:51] she don't have her ear things in but I
[1:45:53] could tell she heard that
[1:46:03] Whitney Whitney was sitting with me and
[1:46:06] we were at a place to where the planes
[1:46:09] would come in and land on the water
[1:46:12] and we were watching we were watching
[1:46:14] that because that don't happen at Pilot
[1:46:16] or it don't happen on
[1:46:19] on Pine Creek Lane it don't happen
[1:46:22] they were coming in I was just enamored
[1:46:25] by that planes coming in land on the
[1:46:27] water scoot up to the place where the
[1:46:29] people got out maybe they were
[1:46:31] delivering the mail maybe they were just
[1:46:33] businessmen
[1:46:34] and so I was just enamored by that and
[1:46:37] something spoke to me go to the door
[1:46:40] I asked Whitney I said somebody at the
[1:46:42] door would you hear somebody knock no
[1:46:45] and so I listened to the voice and I
[1:46:47] went to the door I opened the door and
[1:46:49] here come Joel
[1:46:51] and Joel's just kind of
[1:46:53] he's got sandals on he's got holes in
[1:46:55] his jeans his hair is just a floating
[1:47:00] I said Joe come on in here sit down with
[1:47:02] me a little bit
[1:47:04] and he came in and he sat down and I had
[1:47:07] my feet up on the rail and he leaned
[1:47:09] back put his feet up on the rail he
[1:47:12] didn't know it he was about to get a
[1:47:13] atmosphere change
[1:47:17] and we begin to talk Small Talk At the
[1:47:20] beginning
[1:47:21] and before long
[1:47:23] God began to read his life
[1:47:27] and he began to read his life and begin
[1:47:29] to talk to him about the Lord
[1:47:32] and then begin to pronounce a blessing
[1:47:34] on him you got the sign of Joseph on you
[1:47:37] and you're going to be blessed in
[1:47:39] everything that you do
[1:47:42] Whitney set 10 feet away and watched Joe
[1:47:46] get a complete nature change
[1:47:51] he walked he got out of that chair a
[1:47:54] complete different person
[1:47:59] then he got in the chair
[1:48:02] today he's got a beautiful family
[1:48:04] beautiful children
[1:48:06] he is blessed Beyond being blessed he
[1:48:09] just keeps climbing the ladder they keep
[1:48:11] giving him bonuses they just keep
[1:48:13] pouring it on him why because on a day
[1:48:18] on a day Jesus met him
[1:48:22] Jesus met him
[1:48:25] that evening we went to supper not
[1:48:28] saying nothing to nobody because I want
[1:48:30] people to see the real Jesus
[1:48:35] and so that evening we go to supper
[1:48:38] believe we had steak we went to supper
[1:48:41] we walked out on the street we begin to
[1:48:43] disperse some some with this door some
[1:48:46] went that store we begin to walk down a
[1:48:49] very busy a busy street and it was wide
[1:48:52] sidewalks and we walked down and I
[1:48:55] looked
[1:48:56] I looked down the street and there was
[1:48:58] Andrew with brother Tom
[1:49:04] I'll let Andrew tell you the rest of it
[1:49:06] but I just tell you
[1:49:09] when I saw brother Tom
[1:49:12] take that white head and begin to bow it
[1:49:14] and put his hands on his shoulders
[1:49:16] and Andrew bowed that red hair
[1:49:19] it didn't matter if they were standing
[1:49:21] in thousands of people was walking
[1:49:23] around them
[1:49:25] it didn't matter what the society
[1:49:28] thought
[1:49:29] one Andrew went to that restaurant and
[1:49:31] walked out on the street and another
[1:49:34] Andrew
[1:49:42] Hallelujah
[1:49:46] another Andrew got changed he became a
[1:49:50] different son he became a different
[1:49:53] husband
[1:49:55] he became a tremendous preacher
[1:50:00] Give the Lord a great big hand
[1:50:16] that Andrew
[1:50:18] preached this week
[1:50:20] 16 years later
[1:50:22] at Mount Baker
[1:50:25] he's preached there before but he
[1:50:27] preached with David
[1:50:29] Mayer
[1:50:32] kind of just end with this
[1:50:34] so it's all on the same tape
[1:50:40] I went to Switzerland brother biscoll
[1:50:43] wanted me to go to Switzerland
[1:50:46] I didn't go the first year that he
[1:50:48] that he wanted me to go
[1:50:50] because I thought it was too busy
[1:50:55] I really didn't want to go
[1:50:57] the next year brother biscoll called me
[1:50:59] and he just placed his burden on my
[1:51:01] heart
[1:51:02] he said Your Atmosphere will change
[1:51:05] lives
[1:51:08] you'll know how to handle the people
[1:51:10] they'll fall in love with you brother
[1:51:12] Ron
[1:51:13] you'll know how to you'll know how to
[1:51:14] bring them to Christ
[1:51:20] we'd preached meetings before he'd saw
[1:51:23] me operate
[1:51:27] so I go
[1:51:30] and so
[1:51:32] there's different interpreters are
[1:51:34] taking care of different preachers
[1:51:36] brother biscoll and myself as speakers
[1:51:40] and so
[1:51:42] Brother David is interpreting for me
[1:51:46] brother David's been here preaching
[1:51:48] he's probably getting ready to preach
[1:51:50] right now on Mount Baker
[1:51:53] and Brother David is in a in a small
[1:51:55] place a small Church
[1:51:58] it's not necessarily preaching he's he's
[1:52:01] just there he's just listening
[1:52:03] but God's Got Something greater for him
[1:52:06] and I'm
[1:52:07] I don't know his history
[1:52:09] I don't know everything about him
[1:52:12] come come come
[1:52:14] yeah come
[1:52:18] William
[1:52:21] Ritalin is not working well this morning
[1:52:24] and so
[1:52:27] he's repeating what I'm saying except
[1:52:29] for it's in French
[1:52:31] and I'm I'm preaching hard in a
[1:52:32] preaching heart and I'm preaching hard
[1:52:34] and we're going and we're going and
[1:52:36] we're going and all of a sudden the Lord
[1:52:37] says speak to David
[1:52:41] I didn't know what he was going to say I
[1:52:42] turned around to David and I said no
[1:52:44] don't don't interpret this
[1:52:46] and David is standing there and he goes
[1:52:48] okay
[1:52:49] okay and I tell him I said God's calling
[1:52:51] you to preach
[1:52:53] and not just preach
[1:52:55] pastor
[1:52:59] well some of his family can understand
[1:53:00] English
[1:53:03] David
[1:53:07] why is he going to dinner with David
[1:53:12] he just called him out of the tree
[1:53:15] why is he going to dinner with David
[1:53:18] well David ain't no preacher he can't be
[1:53:22] no pastor but God don't look at your now
[1:53:28] God God sees that David's going to be
[1:53:31] one of the most powerful preachers that
[1:53:33] ever comes out of Europe
[1:53:36] now I didn't give him that
[1:53:39] God just recognized the gift that was
[1:53:42] inside of him
[1:53:44] this guy preaches now to more people
[1:53:46] than he ever preached to before he got
[1:53:48] here
[1:53:49] [Music]
[1:53:53] you know how many households he preached
[1:53:55] to last night besides here I told him
[1:53:58] this morning
[1:54:00] 512 households
[1:54:14] and he preached patience to all of them
[1:54:18] and some of you really needed it
[1:54:20] [Applause]
[1:54:34] when I first met him I wasn't scared of
[1:54:36] him
[1:54:37] I wasn't scared of his ego
[1:54:40] he's a team member
[1:54:42] he can add something to our church he
[1:54:44] can be a blessing to us
[1:54:47] I saw incredible potential laying on the
[1:54:50] inside of him
[1:54:51] I'm just picking him but what about you
[1:54:56] because if this atmosphere gets on you
[1:54:59] just right
[1:55:01] and you fall in love with Jesus
[1:55:06] [Applause]
[1:55:14] wish you could feel what I feel

[1:55:20] you came in
[1:55:21] your T-shirt had never been ironed since
[1:55:24] it came out of the factory
[1:55:33] and you fell in love with him
[1:55:36] and you are in these t-shirts now
[1:55:41] and what I saw inside of him is what he
[1:55:44] is now
[1:55:46] maybe you didn't see it but I saw it
[1:55:49] and he's transformed this church
[1:55:52] he's a behind the scenes guy that's
[1:55:54] transformed this church because he felt
[1:55:57] like that these messages need to be
[1:55:59] heard around the world
[1:56:03] thank you
[1:56:08] brother brother Jerry I'm done I'm just

[1:56:46] times it was Unreal

[1:56:50] but he couldn't fight the wild dogs that
[1:56:52] got a hold of him
[1:56:55] they came and I I saw them I saw them in
[1:56:58] the yard I saw them out in the driveway
[1:57:01] it was before we cut down all the trees
[1:57:02] and

[1:57:05] there and Jerry was being a good husband

[1:57:15] there to where he's at he's getting
[1:57:16] ready to have a moment
[1:57:24] and we stood there
[1:57:26] under an old oak tree

[1:59:18] article
[1:59:19] and here I am preaching in his arms
[1:59:23] and he's blowed away
[1:59:27] because now he's made a choice and now
[1:59:30] God is preaching to him

[2:00:01] you're no doubt going to be having
[2:00:02] difficulty their situation is going to
[2:00:05] be going on but God's not worried about
[2:00:08] the temporary
[2:00:11] he's changed your life and he's prepared
[2:00:13] you now you may have walked 40 years
[2:00:15] with him but you still see things in you
[2:00:18] but God's going to change you in the
[2:00:20] moment and the twinkling of an eye
[2:00:23] and one moment you're going to have gray
[2:00:25] hair and and need glasses and I don't
[2:00:28] know where all this stuff is going to go
[2:00:30] but those things are going to evaporate
[2:00:38] and the devil that's fighting you now in
[2:00:41] that moment can fight you no longer

[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:57] we walked in the house and we sat down
[2:02:02] a small place
[2:02:04] everything was right in order
[2:02:06] [Music]
[2:02:09] I sat down on the sofa
[2:02:13] there was a lady that
[2:02:14] a little bit elderly
[2:02:16] [Music]
[2:02:19] she was there she had an envelope
[2:02:21] husband
[2:02:22] that she takes care of all the time
[2:02:24] and she had somebody else to take care
[2:02:26] of him that afternoon
[2:02:29] she was there in the home a real
[2:02:31] believer
[2:02:34] I sat down on the sofa as I was sitting
[2:02:38] there
[2:02:40] she comes to end
[2:02:43] and she's overwhelmed in her emotions
[2:02:47] overwhelmed
[2:02:52] and she gets down on her knees right in
[2:02:54] front of me
[2:02:55] and puts your hands on my knees
[2:03:00] and she's bellowing crying
[2:03:04] I asked brother Murphy what is she
[2:03:06] saying
[2:03:10] she said for this I have prayed
[2:03:14] that brother Ron would come
[2:03:16] and now he's in our home
[2:03:20] and he's sitting on our couch
[2:03:22] [Music]
[2:03:24] we wanted this atmosphere in our home
[2:03:29] what a greater than brother Ron showed
[2:03:32] up that day
[2:03:34] I don't know whether you felt it or not
[2:03:36] but
[2:03:37] greater than brother Ron's been in the
[2:03:39] room

[2:04:04] something about him that's different
[2:04:07] they don't have to put it on it's just
[2:04:09] different
