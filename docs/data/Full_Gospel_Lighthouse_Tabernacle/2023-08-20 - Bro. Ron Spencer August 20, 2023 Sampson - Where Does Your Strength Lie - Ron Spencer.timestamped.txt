[24:59] weeks ago so if you are interested in
[25:01] having any of those tapes brother

[25:23] concerns during the meetings just see
[25:26] both of them we're trying to take a lot
[25:28] of the load off brother Alden and
[25:30] responsibilities there that we can start

[25:39] amen we love our brother out in there
[25:42] amen he does a lot of work around here
[25:45] that's on that don't get seen or thanked
[25:47] for and there's a lot of you do that too
[25:49] so we want to thank each and every one
[25:50] of you what you're doing a couple
[25:53] reminders we're preparing for our Labor
[25:55] Day so just remember that we are
[25:59] expecting crowds so don't expect your
[26:01] seat to be saved
[26:02] before or after church so if you want to
[26:05] get a certain seat you got to get here
[26:07] early because we're going to pack them
[26:08] in and just because it's one seat that
[26:12] doesn't mean anything during the labor
[26:14] day we're going to pack them in as much
[26:15] as we can hold your hands up scoot in
[26:18] sit down we're going to keep doing that
[26:20] until we get them all in here
[26:22] amen so
[26:24] I think we did a comparison last year
[26:26] it's not just 12 or 14 seats I think we
[26:28] can get more people and I ain't going to
[26:31] say it like I think it but you can get
[26:32] more on one seat than what you think
[26:35] amen so uh so we're gonna pack her in
[26:37] here and just take all your stuff with
[26:40] you your toys Bibles fans all that stuff
[26:44] needs to go with you every service that
[26:46] week because when you come in the next
[26:48] meeting it might not be there amen
[26:51] so just be mindful of that and then on
[26:53] the work day tomorrow as well we're
[26:54] going to be bringing more chairs and
[26:56] stuff in here and doing stuff like that
[26:59] so thank the Lord for all the goodness
[27:01] of God and everything he's doing for us
[27:03] we're expecting great Services amen

[50:26] amen
[50:29] Hallelujah
[50:39] Hallelujah
[50:46] I want to speak today on Samson
[50:49] where does your strength lay
[50:53] Samson
[50:55] where does your strength lay
[50:58] amen
[50:59] amen Judges chapter 16 and verse 15.
[51:04] and when she said unto him
[51:07] how count us thou say I've Loved thee
[51:11] went on heart is not with me
[51:16] thou Hast mocked me these three times
[51:20] and has not told me we're in thy great
[51:23] strength lieth
[51:26] and it came to pass that when she
[51:28] pressed him daily with her words and
[51:31] urged him
[51:32] so that his soul was vexed unto death
[51:37] that he told her all his heart
[51:40] and said unto her
[51:43] there hath not come a razor upon mine
[51:46] head
[51:47] for I have been a Nazarite unto God from
[51:51] my mother's womb
[51:53] if I'd be shaven
[51:55] then my strength will go from me
[51:58] and I shall become weak and be like any
[52:02] other man
[52:04] and when Delilah saw that he had told
[52:07] her all his heart
[52:08] she sent and called for the Lords of the
[52:11] Philistines saying
[52:13] come up this once for he has showed me
[52:17] all his heart
[52:19] then the Lords of the Philistines came
[52:22] up unto her and brought money in their
[52:26] hand
[52:27] and she made him sleep upon her knees
[52:30] and she called for a man and she caused
[52:34] him to shave off Seven Locks of his head
[52:37] and she began to afflict him and his
[52:40] strength went from him
[52:42] and she said the Philistines be upon
[52:45] thee Samson and he'll walk out of his
[52:47] sleep and said I will go out as other
[52:51] times I think this is a phenomenal
[52:53] statement
[52:54] I will go out as other times before and
[52:58] shake myself
[53:00] this is this is incredible words and
[53:03] whis not
[53:05] that the Lord was Departed
[53:08] from him
[53:09] amen let's pray Lord Jesus we love you
[53:12] today thankful to be in your house one
[53:15] more time you give us an opportunity
[53:18] that we never want to take for granted
[53:20] one day we'll walk through these doors
[53:23] for the last time maybe not even
[53:25] realizing it's our last time
[53:27] but I pray that you'd speak to our
[53:29] hearts today Lord our desire when we
[53:32] come here is to draw closer to you Lord
[53:35] if there would be anything in us that
[53:37] would not be right we asked you that we
[53:40] apply it to the blood of Jesus Christ
[53:42] ask you to forgive us wash our spirit
[53:45] wash our flesh Lord wash us today and we
[53:49] shall be clean Lord anoint us in a
[53:52] special way we pray an anoint us a
[53:54] speaker but not just speaker but
[53:57] enormous as the hearer today we pray in
[54:00] Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and
[54:02] amen you can be seated
[54:08] verse 23
[54:14] . let's just go back to 21.
[54:17] the Philistines took him
[54:20] and put out his eyes
[54:23] and brought him down to Gaza
[54:25] and bound him with Fetters of brass
[54:28] and he did grind in the prison house
[54:31] how bit the hair of his head began to
[54:34] grow again and he was shaven
[54:37] then the Lords of the Philistines
[54:39] gathered them together
[54:41] for to offer a great sacrifice unto
[54:44] Dagen their God
[54:45] and to Rejoice for they said our God
[54:48] hath delivered Samson our enemy
[54:52] into our hand
[54:55] and when the people saw that praised
[54:57] their God and for they said our God hath
[54:59] delivered us delivered into our hands
[55:02] our enemy and the destroyer of our
[55:05] country
[55:06] which he slew many of us and it came to
[55:09] pass when their hearts were merry
[55:11] that they said call for Samson that he
[55:15] may make a sport
[55:17] and that called for Samson out of the
[55:19] prison house
[55:21] and he made them Sports Sport and he
[55:24] said
[55:25] him between the pillars
[55:30] quite an incredible scene
[55:34] brother Brandon would say it like this
[55:35] he said let's just think
[55:38] I can see the Warriors some of them old
[55:40] veterans with scars on their faces
[55:44] huh
[55:45] as they looked at Samson and standing
[55:48] there hopeless helpless
[55:51] they remembered of seeing him stand one
[55:53] time with a Jawbone in his hand and and
[55:57] a thousand Philistines
[55:59] think about this
[56:01] and a thousand Philistines laying there
[56:04] dead at his feet
[56:06] and now a little boy is leading him
[56:09] around by the hand
[56:10] they could remember
[56:13] how he questioned the council with the
[56:16] news and was brought that a man a mere
[56:19] man
[56:20] this was a mere man they thought
[56:24] took a Jawbone of a mule
[56:28] and many of us you have taken the
[56:31] history of the Philistines
[56:33] those armor that they wore the helmet of
[56:36] their head was almost an inch thick with
[56:39] brass and their coat was that they wore
[56:42] they were they were great Mighty Men
[56:45] with great laps a half inch of brass up
[56:48] and down their body to cover it with and
[56:52] a long spear coming a hard strike a
[56:55] two-edged sword that would knock them
[56:58] off of their feet
[57:00] now how could a man
[57:03] just one man
[57:06] with a thousand around him armored and
[57:09] dressed with armor with the spears those
[57:12] big helmets that only though I have
[57:16] showed through
[57:18] How could a man take a Jawbone of a mule
[57:23] and beat down them
[57:26] all of them at one time
[57:29] while the first lick with that old
[57:32] battle that old brittle Jawbone would
[57:35] fly to thousands of pieces hitting those
[57:38] helmets they know that something was in
[57:42] the Supernatural Realm when he struck
[57:45] that Warrior on the head and the thing
[57:49] dented in and killed him instantly
[57:53] right hand left hand he struck
[57:57] and every time he struck the power of
[57:59] God struck with it
[58:02] it doesn't it doesn't take when you when
[58:05] you think about it what a great thing
[58:08] it only takes a a hand that's completely
[58:12] Anointed with the Holy Ghost with God
[58:16] God's power to strike down any enemy
[58:20] under in any circumstance
[58:23] and how those Warriors remembered
[58:27] could it be possible that we've got the
[58:30] wrong man
[58:33] some of them might have said no that's
[58:35] him
[58:36] I can just see a stature that's Samson
[58:39] he's the one that served what he said
[58:43] was a true God
[58:46] but his God has forsaken him
[58:51] um
[58:53] Samson would pray this prayer
[58:56] Samson prayed right when he said it Lord
[59:00] let me die with these Philistines
[59:04] he failed
[59:06] but he said let me die he said you must
[59:09] be ready to die to your enemy that's got
[59:12] this victory over you you must be
[59:15] willing to surrender to your own ideas
[59:17] so Samson was willing to pay the price
[59:22] to get the power of God back in his life
[59:26] again
[59:27] think of that statement
[59:30] now they was wrong when they said that
[59:32] God had forgot forsaken him God had not
[59:36] forsaken him
[59:37] he had forsaken God
[59:41] and I think about that's the way it is
[59:44] with people today it isn't God that's
[59:46] forsaken the church
[59:49] it isn't God that's forsaken the church
[59:52] it is the first it is the church that
[59:55] has forsaken God
[59:58] and his word
[1:00:00] and that's exactly what's the matter
[1:00:05] now notice this statement he says now
[1:00:07] Samson knew in his backslidden condition
[1:00:11] he know that he couldn't have the
[1:00:14] strength to meet the challenge of the
[1:00:16] hour
[1:00:17] though he was there all of the Machinery
[1:00:20] was there the same muscles that could
[1:00:23] take the Jawbone in and beat down a a
[1:00:26] thousand Philistines the same muscles
[1:00:29] hung on the same man the same shoulders
[1:00:32] that could take the gates of Gaza up on
[1:00:35] the top of the mountain was still the
[1:00:37] same muscles hanging on him
[1:00:40] or I could say it somewhere you could
[1:00:43] see it but he know
[1:00:45] it's a difference now that he note
[1:00:49] that he couldn't meet the challenge of
[1:00:52] the hour so does the church know in its
[1:00:57] immoral condition we'll never meet the
[1:01:00] challenge of the hour
[1:01:02] what a state America is in what a state
[1:01:05] the modern church is in
[1:01:09] look at the moral condition of the day
[1:01:11] and were we hard
[1:01:13] I think it's almost unfathomable of
[1:01:17] where we have come in just a few years
[1:01:21] in a few Decades of where we stand at
[1:01:24] today
[1:01:25] no moral compass whatsoever
[1:01:29] I promise almost every day I'm going to
[1:01:32] I'm going to boycott the news and some
[1:01:34] days I do boycott the news it just seems
[1:01:37] overwhelming
[1:01:41] it seems just overwhelming to me
[1:01:48] overwhelming to me of what is going on
[1:01:51] around us
[1:01:52] but it gives us even greater
[1:01:55] responsibility
[1:01:59] he gives us a greater responsibility
[1:02:01] that our light must shine in this dark
[1:02:05] place
[1:02:07] because remember a candle isn't much
[1:02:11] strength in the daylight
[1:02:15] you really don't even need the light
[1:02:18] but let me just say when it becomes not
[1:02:24] when it becomes night that candle begins
[1:02:27] to illuminate the place where you're at
[1:02:30] we have a we have a marriage that's at
[1:02:33] our place that's getting the trash of
[1:02:36] her dumpster and making a mess and
[1:02:40] you know so when my dog barks
[1:02:42] my dog stands about that tall and
[1:02:46] he's a Bernie doodle and
[1:02:48] and he's
[1:02:50] he's quite mischievous and yet he'll lay
[1:02:54] on our laps and you know you know scream
[1:02:57] for a hug and scream for a belly rubbing
[1:03:01] yet when you're gone he'll he'll be
[1:03:04] mischievous and eat things he shouldn't
[1:03:06] eat and tear up things that he shouldn't
[1:03:08] tear up and he'll get in the mail he'll
[1:03:11] get into in the boxes that come from
[1:03:14] Amazon and
[1:03:16] you feel like doing a lot of things to
[1:03:19] him
[1:03:22] and he just is a real he's a real terror
[1:03:26] on our screened-in porch at night when
[1:03:28] that bear walks by
[1:03:30] you would think that he could go out
[1:03:32] there and eat him up
[1:03:38] who opened that gate
[1:03:43] but I got a I got a little flashlight
[1:03:47] and it's not but about that long a
[1:03:50] brother from Ohio gave it to me
[1:03:53] and it can illuminate the night
[1:03:56] it can shine I I don't know exactly how
[1:03:59] far it can shine but it can shine maybe
[1:04:01] three or four hundred yards and
[1:04:03] illuminate it
[1:04:04] you know as dark as that that bear is I
[1:04:08] can see it
[1:04:10] I can see it it's red eyes begin to
[1:04:12] shine and you know I can walk right up
[1:04:14] to that Rascal and you know he's not
[1:04:18] scared of me he said had enough weight
[1:04:20] that he's not scared of me and he can
[1:04:22] just stand there and raise up on his
[1:04:24] back feet he lights my trash
[1:04:29] he likes digging through it I don't like
[1:04:32] it that he's digging through it
[1:04:34] now I I told you that story for a reason
[1:04:38] in the Old Testament men didn't have the
[1:04:41] Holy Ghost
[1:04:43] they just would go and offer sacrifice
[1:04:46] one time a year and and they that the
[1:04:49] life of that lamb or the life of that
[1:04:51] turtle dove could not come back on them
[1:04:54] but yet God in his Redemption story
[1:04:58] would take these individuals and raise
[1:05:01] them up to defeat the enemy
[1:05:05] God purposed that Samson would be a man
[1:05:09] that would defeat the Philistines
[1:05:13] even before his birth he had a reason
[1:05:16] for Samson to be born he had a reason to
[1:05:20] have a Nazarite vow on him and Samson
[1:05:24] was not going to be a natural man in
[1:05:27] that human flesh as long as he kept the
[1:05:30] Nazarite vow God would anoint him
[1:05:34] with a super power that no other man had
[1:05:39] been Anointed with even till this day
[1:05:42] but Samson began to Scallywag around
[1:05:47] and Samson had the idea that it would
[1:05:51] always be this way he could
[1:05:54] he could be the representative of Israel
[1:05:57] but he could also court now think about
[1:06:00] it all the girls in the promised land he
[1:06:04] went court and in another spot
[1:06:06] there's work got him in trouble
[1:06:10] when you start worshiping false gods
[1:06:12] it'll get you in trouble
[1:06:15] are you with me now
[1:06:17] brother Ben wouldn't make this statement
[1:06:19] invisible Union of the Bride 65. he said
[1:06:23] it's a true picture of the modern church
[1:06:25] today
[1:06:26] neither does the modern Church want any
[1:06:28] of these screaming shouting
[1:06:31] tongue-speaking Acts 2 38 youngins
[1:06:34] around her
[1:06:35] she don't want them looping and crying
[1:06:38] and screaming while such a child would
[1:06:40] immediately be put out their
[1:06:42] denomination if they had one of them in
[1:06:44] their churches they'd throw it out real
[1:06:46] quick why are you letting such things as
[1:06:48] that go on
[1:06:50] so you see she's pregnant with something
[1:06:52] talking about the church pregnated with
[1:06:55] something because she's bringing forth
[1:06:56] members all the time
[1:06:59] she don't want them screaming hollering
[1:07:02] blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures
[1:07:05] that she thinks they are
[1:07:08] it would certainly embarrass her it
[1:07:11] would ruin her her educated ethical
[1:07:15] scientific society that she belonged to
[1:07:18] here and they would throw her out real
[1:07:20] quick at the next Council she can't have
[1:07:22] it she don't want to be pregnated with
[1:07:25] the word because that's the only
[1:07:29] that the word can bring forth
[1:07:34] born of the spirit of God it has the
[1:07:36] spirit of God in it no intellectual
[1:07:39] Church joining Creed going black carrot
[1:07:43] painted face there's no such a thing as
[1:07:45] that that in it at all
[1:07:47] you can't find that in the word of God
[1:07:50] you find old-fashioned Sanctified Holy
[1:07:53] Ghost Field child born of the spirit of
[1:07:56] God I love this screaming and hollering
[1:08:00] and shouting praising God
[1:08:03] now that's all together out of the
[1:08:05] reaches of her she don't want it no sir
[1:08:07] no indeed what what does she do then
[1:08:11] she brings forth I'm just going to say
[1:08:13] it how he said it she brings forth a
[1:08:15] pair of a painted face shorts wearing
[1:08:19] Jezebel Society
[1:08:22] illegitimate clats they call them I I
[1:08:26] think it they call it cats look at the
[1:08:28] cat going there look at that that's
[1:08:30] something like that she was born and
[1:08:33] married and connected with her first
[1:08:35] husband Adam by an adulterous wife of
[1:08:39] Eve Adam's first wife you say adulterous
[1:08:42] she sure was she claims that as Adam
[1:08:45] this first Adam is dead and he died a
[1:08:49] long time ago and I'm Reborn
[1:08:52] he said and and I'm certainly married to
[1:08:56] a second Adam and that's called Christ
[1:08:59] comes down just a little further and he
[1:09:01] says now watch her lover you want to see
[1:09:03] who she's in love with the word says
[1:09:06] this but she says my church says this
[1:09:11] then who's she in love with
[1:09:14] then who is her husband
[1:09:16] her own fruits prove what she is shows
[1:09:20] what she is she was born first to Adam
[1:09:23] and that was her natural nature and she
[1:09:26] never left that that's a lover of the
[1:09:29] war of the world she claims that she's
[1:09:32] born the second time to Christ but her
[1:09:36] lover notice Adam because she loves the
[1:09:40] world
[1:09:41] easy statement you can't love God and
[1:09:43] love the world that's the same time
[1:09:47] so churches begin to pattern themselves
[1:09:50] after Hollywood
[1:09:52] because it's needed is your way
[1:09:56] are you with me now
[1:09:58] we live in this world
[1:10:01] but we're not of this world
[1:10:04] Revelation Chapter 2 nevertheless I have
[1:10:06] some what against thee because thou has
[1:10:09] left thy first love to understand this
[1:10:11] you must realize that the spirit
[1:10:14] is not speaking to the original Saints
[1:10:17] of Ephesus alone this message is through
[1:10:20] the entire age
[1:10:21] it's the message it's it's to all
[1:10:24] generations Now history keeps repeating
[1:10:27] itself
[1:10:28] in the generations of Israel we see
[1:10:31] Revival in one generation only to see
[1:10:35] the fires fading in the next and in the
[1:10:38] third generation Embers may be glowing
[1:10:41] slightly but in the fourth generation
[1:10:43] there is no visit there's no vistage of
[1:10:47] whatsoever of the original Flame
[1:10:51] then God lights the fire again and the
[1:10:55] same processors are repeated it is
[1:10:57] simply the manifestation of truth that
[1:11:00] God has no grandchildren
[1:11:04] salvation is not passed on by the
[1:11:07] natural birth any more than there is
[1:11:10] truth to the apostolic succession it
[1:11:13] isn't the word you start out with True
[1:11:17] born-again Believers
[1:11:20] and the Next Generation comes along and
[1:11:23] there are no longer than just plain
[1:11:25] Christians but they have a
[1:11:28] denominational name
[1:11:30] they're Baptist they're methodists and
[1:11:32] that is exactly what they do
[1:11:34] they're not Christians
[1:11:37] you have to be born again
[1:11:40] by the will of God not by the will of
[1:11:43] man to be saved and these folks are
[1:11:46] coming along together not by the now by
[1:11:49] the will of man and I don't say that of
[1:11:52] them that they aren't right with God not
[1:11:54] for a minute do thy say that but the
[1:11:58] original fire
[1:12:01] has died down
[1:12:04] one of the greatest preachers that ever
[1:12:06] lived was a man named Spurgeon and
[1:12:09] Spurgeon many of you read him because
[1:12:11] you read him by your by your daily
[1:12:13] readings that you you read that but
[1:12:16] listen Spurgeon had an incredible
[1:12:18] Revival that was among them
[1:12:21] had schools of preachers had men that
[1:12:24] came in and he was the one that said
[1:12:26] that every sermon should be written down
[1:12:29] and he would write down his sermons by
[1:12:31] the hundreds of thousands and they begin
[1:12:33] to develop those sermons on Tuesday and
[1:12:37] by Sunday they would have about a
[1:12:39] hundred thousand copies of it but he is
[1:12:41] the one that said one day they will be
[1:12:44] able to capture a man's voice
[1:12:48] they'll be able to capture a man's voice
[1:12:50] while he's preaching where are we at
[1:12:53] today
[1:12:54] but if you look back where spurgeon's at
[1:12:57] the schools don't even want nothing to
[1:13:00] do with him
[1:13:01] they've taken these names off their
[1:13:03] schools and they don't want to have a
[1:13:04] part of what Spurgeon did
[1:13:07] I would say John Wesley would be very
[1:13:10] disappointed
[1:13:12] with the Methodist today
[1:13:17] I'd say Smith would be very disappointed
[1:13:20] with the Baptist today
[1:13:23] but I would say if William Branham
[1:13:25] walked into this church today
[1:13:28] he'd be very pleased
[1:13:33] to be able to preach to bride believe in
[1:13:36] people
[1:13:38] that love the message the way that you
[1:13:41] do
[1:13:42] we're not a denomination
[1:13:45] we have not denominated this thing we do
[1:13:49] not have headquarters in Jeffersonville
[1:13:53] [Applause]
[1:13:55] are you with me now
[1:13:59] our headquarters is in the Holy Ghost
[1:14:04] and we want the same spirit of God that
[1:14:07] was on Acts 2 to be moving through this
[1:14:11] audience back and forth
[1:14:13] we want the same lives live today that
[1:14:17] lived inside of Jesus Christ
[1:14:20] we do not want a church of drama
[1:14:26] where there's bickering and fussing and
[1:14:29] going backwards forth that happens
[1:14:32] with carnal believers
[1:14:35] that are constantly having to be propped
[1:14:38] up with a crutch
[1:14:41] but if you get the Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] that will be your satisfying portion
[1:14:53] that will be your satisfying portion
[1:15:01] are you with me now
[1:15:04] you see the reason that I'm speaking
[1:15:06] this today
[1:15:07] is I spoke at Ohio
[1:15:10] at St Mary's camp
[1:15:12] many of you were there 20 years ago when
[1:15:15] I spoke there and I spoke I actually
[1:15:18] took this thought
[1:15:20] and I spoke on the moderate Church
[1:15:24] that does not want any of these acts 2
[1:15:27] 38 tongue speaking whooping crying
[1:15:29] youngness
[1:15:31] and he said I begin to reiterate that
[1:15:34] the modern Church
[1:15:36] wants a polished up group
[1:15:40] I do not want to polish the message
[1:15:44] to where it's acceptable amongst the
[1:15:47] everyday Society
[1:15:48] [Applause]
[1:15:50] it is a message to call out a bride out
[1:15:54] of the world out of denominationalism
[1:15:58] are you with me to keep you from having
[1:16:01] to go through the tribulation period
[1:16:05] you didn't know it but I was fighting
[1:16:07] behind the scenes and struggling with
[1:16:10] spirits that even at that time did not
[1:16:13] want altar calls
[1:16:15] or did not want prayer lines
[1:16:18] well it didn't offend me none whatsoever
[1:16:21] I just want only had an altar call and
[1:16:24] about 400 people came to the altar
[1:16:27] you can't stop
[1:16:29] a Holy Ghost Field man of God
[1:16:33] I refuse for men to try to formalize
[1:16:36] this message
[1:16:40] I will knock cower down to it
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:17:07] just uh last week
[1:17:11] God moved at the end of the service
[1:17:13] after I had preached
[1:17:15] and it took about five minutes on Samson
[1:17:18] and that's why we're speaking today on
[1:17:20] it
[1:17:22] and as God began to move
[1:17:25] a call to the altar came
[1:17:28] and I would estimate hundreds of people
[1:17:31] came to the altar
[1:17:33] received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:35] they wrapped around they wrapped around
[1:17:38] all over the stage wrapped around I'd
[1:17:40] never seen quite anything quite like it
[1:17:42] how many of you was there
[1:17:46] I know you was
[1:17:47] how many of you was there in that
[1:17:49] meeting what an incredible move of God
[1:17:53] that was there
[1:17:55] receiving the Holy Ghost receiving life
[1:17:57] change
[1:18:00] are you with me because I still believe
[1:18:02] in it
[1:18:04] I may be 62 years old next week but I'm
[1:18:08] not retiring
[1:18:10] I'm not I'm not going to sit down on the
[1:18:12] couch somewhere or another
[1:18:14] I am going to keep preaching to you the
[1:18:17] passion that has been inside of me all
[1:18:20] of these years
[1:18:33] okay
[1:18:39] are you with me now thank you for that
[1:18:42] I would say today that people who are
[1:18:45] ashamed of the move of God and to
[1:18:46] worship
[1:18:47] have chose to polish their rocks
[1:18:51] polish the message
[1:18:54] and they're wanting a better class
[1:18:57] a class of of worship with formal
[1:19:01] patterns well let me just let me just
[1:19:04] preach to you
[1:19:06] before long if you you push the gifts
[1:19:09] out of the church
[1:19:10] and you push real worship out of the
[1:19:13] church you're going to have to introduce
[1:19:15] programs
[1:19:20] and before long you're introducing
[1:19:22] programs that you have to you have to
[1:19:25] you have to begin to introduce programs
[1:19:28] to keep people clean
[1:19:31] because the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:19:33] you can't get people sealed
[1:19:36] and until you get people sealed with the
[1:19:39] Holy Ghost it'll keep pornography out of
[1:19:41] your life
[1:19:43] it'll keep music out of your life that's
[1:19:46] not right
[1:19:48] you don't have to preach dress code when
[1:19:51] you're talking about Holy Ghost Field
[1:19:52] people
[1:19:54] it'll cause conviction your homes will
[1:19:57] be homes of love and not fighting and
[1:20:00] stewing and
[1:20:05] are you with me now
[1:20:07] but when you divorce yourself from
[1:20:10] worship
[1:20:12] now now let me just say this to you
[1:20:14] brother Branham came to our area for a
[1:20:17] reason
[1:20:19] it was the Pentecostal people that
[1:20:22] invited him here through the Full Gospel
[1:20:24] businessmen
[1:20:25] because the background of our area
[1:20:28] was people that that worshiped at little
[1:20:31] missions
[1:20:33] and they worshiped in places and they
[1:20:35] were not ashamed
[1:20:37] to worship God
[1:20:41] to the point
[1:20:43] to when people tried to hush it up or
[1:20:46] even to try to put it out
[1:20:48] that they would shoot through windows
[1:20:50] and while the women were dancing
[1:20:54] bullets would fall off of their dresses
[1:20:57] you say well brother Ron that was in the
[1:20:59] flesh bullets falling off your dresses
[1:21:02] in the flesh
[1:21:06] men sticking their head in hot stoves
[1:21:10] now let me just say this to you we're
[1:21:12] not expecting you to do that and neither
[1:21:14] are we expecting bullets to be falling
[1:21:16] off of your dresses but it's the same
[1:21:19] God
[1:21:21] it is the same God Among Us
[1:21:25] and brother Branham was not ashamed of
[1:21:28] it all those years ago and neither would
[1:21:31] he be ashamed
[1:21:33] of it today
[1:21:36] brother on but that's Wildfire okay
[1:21:40] sure I'm sure that people get in the
[1:21:42] flesh and get a little wild brother
[1:21:44] Brown called himself a wild preacher
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:52] I'm just getting started
[1:21:55] I'm just getting started
[1:21:58] one day I preached a sermon on the
[1:22:01] autopsy of a dead Church
[1:22:03] brother Homer loved it he absolutely
[1:22:06] loved it
[1:22:08] because men in their denominational
[1:22:11] systems once the fire had started classy
[1:22:15] people began to come into the church
[1:22:18] and they begin to come in bankers and
[1:22:21] all different kind of people begin to
[1:22:22] come in and there's Bankers here don't
[1:22:24] be ashamed of me but people wanted it to
[1:22:27] become more classy
[1:22:30] laughs
[1:22:32] they didn't want to have to go through
[1:22:33] Hog Pen experiences
[1:22:36] they didn't want to come to the Altar
[1:22:37] and die out crying and screaming that
[1:22:40] their old flesh would die and they could
[1:22:43] have a new man
[1:22:45] they didn't want to be baptized in the
[1:22:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:49] they replaced the move of God with
[1:22:51] boards and they replaced it with
[1:22:53] programs they made decisions to quieten
[1:22:57] the atmosphere of their Church gifts
[1:23:00] were not no longer welcomed
[1:23:03] and just a few statements from the
[1:23:05] pulpit would begin to chill the
[1:23:07] atmosphere of God moving
[1:23:10] people became afraid of the holy ghost
[1:23:13] moving
[1:23:16] but it becomes an atmosphere to where
[1:23:18] the church begins to die
[1:23:21] it becomes an atmosphere to where you
[1:23:24] get a religious a religious atmosphere
[1:23:29] and sin becomes comfortable in the
[1:23:32] church
[1:23:33] May sin never become comfortable in this
[1:23:37] church
[1:23:38] [Applause]
[1:23:53] programs
[1:23:56] today
[1:23:59] today they if they want a large crowd
[1:24:02] they'll bring singing groups in
[1:24:09] they'll bring some tech talk preacher in
[1:24:13] that can blow your minds with his Greek
[1:24:17] or blow your minds with some some talk
[1:24:20] some kind of psychology
[1:24:23] that won't deliver people folks I'm
[1:24:25] sorry
[1:24:27] I I just have to be the one I'm the
[1:24:30] messenger today
[1:24:31] I've been the messenger since I was a
[1:24:33] boy 40 years I preached this same thing
[1:24:37] I haven't changed whatsoever
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:42] but when you begin to go toward the
[1:24:44] world you'll do like Samson did
[1:24:48] if Samson would have stayed in his place
[1:24:52] if he would have stayed in his place he
[1:24:55] would have carried out the mind of God
[1:24:58] he would have did his job but he began
[1:25:01] to flirt with the world
[1:25:04] now let me just say this to you Samson
[1:25:06] must have seemed like some incredible
[1:25:08] Champion even to his own folks I was
[1:25:11] looking for the word today uh of these
[1:25:14] superheroes what's those I don't mean to
[1:25:17] compare it this way but what's those
[1:25:18] movies that that have these great Heroes
[1:25:21] what's that term
[1:25:25] Marvel
[1:25:27] Marvel is Emma right there Marvel hero
[1:25:31] they must have thought
[1:25:33] when they got word that Hermione
[1:25:36] championed Samson took a Jawbone of an
[1:25:38] ass
[1:25:40] and killed a thousand men
[1:25:44] maybe when Gaza when the Great Gates
[1:25:48] maybe 12 tons
[1:25:51] those great Gates when he became
[1:25:53] anointed he picked them up
[1:25:56] and carried him up on a hill
[1:25:59] not just picked them up but he carried
[1:26:01] him up on a hill can you imagine trying
[1:26:04] to take those Gates back down and put
[1:26:06] them in their place
[1:26:08] the legend that began to be around him
[1:26:12] now let me just say this to you no doubt
[1:26:15] many of the population didn't realize
[1:26:17] that there was something underneath
[1:26:22] when his courts were broken all of the
[1:26:25] things took place
[1:26:27] but there was an underlying sin that was
[1:26:30] destroying this great man's life
[1:26:34] it's the underlying sin that is
[1:26:36] destroyed way too many churches
[1:26:41] and as I said and studied this this week
[1:26:44] and I thought about I thought about
[1:26:47] people
[1:26:49] great people that seem to be on the
[1:26:52] right track for so long
[1:26:56] I'm going to preach
[1:27:00] they seem to be on the right track for
[1:27:03] so
[1:27:06] for soul preachers
[1:27:09] seem to be so right and we saw so
[1:27:12] phenomenal it's phenomenal Miracles
[1:27:15] amongst them
[1:27:18] but after a while they laid their head
[1:27:20] in the Lila's lap
[1:27:27] the first time that I ever saw brother
[1:27:29] Donnie Reagan preach
[1:27:31] he was a new kid on the Block
[1:27:34] and he's preaching at a large at a large
[1:27:37] convention
[1:27:38] God lays a sermon on his heart
[1:27:41] you say brother on this is difficult to
[1:27:43] what you're preaching today
[1:27:44] my job's not too difficult today
[1:27:48] Donnie Reagan's job was difficult that
[1:27:50] day
[1:27:51] and he's preaching a sermon on Samson
[1:27:54] you've laid your head
[1:27:58] in the Lawless lap too long
[1:28:02] and he turns around to a phenomenal
[1:28:05] well-known preacher
[1:28:07] and points his finger in the eyes and
[1:28:11] says
[1:28:12] you're the man that's laid your head in
[1:28:15] Delilah's lap too long to the people he
[1:28:18] looked like an incredible hero
[1:28:21] but behind the scenes he was having
[1:28:23] affair
[1:28:25] one sermon destroyed his kingdom
[1:28:29] one of brother Homer's favorite
[1:28:30] statements your sins
[1:28:35] your sins
[1:28:37] we'll find you out
[1:28:42] you can't sin or maybe for a while you
[1:28:45] get by with it but you're really not
[1:28:47] getting by with it
[1:28:51] you're really not getting by with it
[1:28:53] let me just say this you
[1:28:55] I would rather ask God and be right
[1:28:58] straight up front with God I'd rather
[1:29:00] ask him God forgive me
[1:29:04] don't let me be a stumbling block to
[1:29:07] anybody else
[1:29:10] yes
[1:29:15] are you with me now
[1:29:17] I don't want to be a stumbling back to
[1:29:19] another person
[1:29:27] right
[1:29:30] where's y'all brother you're doing fine
[1:29:33] someone said I was hiding behind cancer
[1:29:36] and it was propping up my Ministry
[1:29:41] how'd you like to go before God with
[1:29:43] that on your chest
[1:29:50] I've been fighting it for three and a
[1:29:52] half years
[1:29:54] I don't want my worst enemy to do that
[1:29:57] so you might want to put that stone back
[1:29:59] in your pocket and ask God to forgive
[1:30:02] you
[1:30:18] brother Ron what do you think about that
[1:30:20] idiots are born every day
[1:30:23] stupid people opened their mouth
[1:30:27] and you don't know that they're stupid
[1:30:29] until they open their mouth and
[1:30:38] I'm being real nice I'm being real nice
[1:30:43] I'm being real nice here
[1:30:48] the next time I'm gonna call their name
[1:30:53] [Applause]
[1:31:04] I just chose three and a half years ago
[1:31:06] to fight cancer
[1:31:09] listen I don't regret my choice
[1:31:12] whatsoever
[1:31:13] I could have died in four months but I
[1:31:16] chose to fight it
[1:31:18] and with God on my side I listen I could
[1:31:21] live a long time
[1:31:23] and while I'm living I'm going to
[1:31:25] torment the kingdom of hell
[1:31:27] I'm gonna preach it I'm gonna pull the
[1:31:29] sword
[1:31:39] I'm going to pull the sword I'm going to
[1:31:41] fight
[1:31:53] now what I would suggest to that person
[1:31:56] with your well body you go do something
[1:32:00] with your well body you go do something
[1:32:05] if I can do this with chemo going in my
[1:32:08] body every day and I can stand here
[1:32:10] dizzy as I am this morning with your
[1:32:13] well body quit throwing rocks at me and
[1:32:15] throw them at the Devil

[1:32:34] Tabernacle
[1:32:36] and he set Samson the Philistines is on
[1:32:39] thee
[1:32:41] his own church
[1:32:43] worldlyism
[1:32:45] is creeping in among you
[1:32:49] what about it have you exposed your
[1:32:52] secret have you exposed that secret that
[1:32:54] God give you
[1:32:56] when you were wallowing there and the
[1:32:58] sawdust a few years ago
[1:33:00] have you let it creep out into social
[1:33:04] formal worship
[1:33:08] what happened to you
[1:33:10] God can come down and perform a miracle
[1:33:13] and go right down through the audience
[1:33:15] tell people the secrets of their heart
[1:33:17] and everything heal the sick and The
[1:33:19] Afflicted and do signs and wonders and
[1:33:22] preach his word as hard as they can by
[1:33:24] the Holy Ghost and people say what's the
[1:33:27] attitude
[1:33:28] well I guess that's all right we enjoy
[1:33:30] listening to it once in a while if we're
[1:33:33] not too tired
[1:33:36] and brother Branham says that's random
[1:33:39] Tabernacle
[1:33:42] and he says the Philistines are on thee
[1:33:47] when used to be the preaching of the
[1:33:50] word and All Saints With Tears in their
[1:33:52] eyes would rise to their feet and walk
[1:33:53] sobbing maybe not say in a word just
[1:33:56] walking around two or three times and
[1:33:58] sat down so filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:02] the word fed them man shall not live by
[1:34:05] ever bread alone but by every word that
[1:34:08] perceiveth out of the mouth of God the
[1:34:10] Philistines are on thee
[1:34:13] Branham Tabernacle
[1:34:19] he says this did you ever go into a
[1:34:23] church where the pastor is real starchy
[1:34:26] the congregation is the same way that's
[1:34:29] right
[1:34:30] it's an atmosphere that's brought it he
[1:34:33] said go into a place where the pastor
[1:34:35] says now wait a minute there's no such a
[1:34:37] thing as a as that nonsense I don't I
[1:34:40] don't believe in such a thing as Divine
[1:34:42] Healing the baptism of Holy Ghost you
[1:34:44] know you'll see every one of them in
[1:34:46] congregation
[1:34:47] but he says if there's an eagle in there
[1:34:50] somewhere
[1:34:53] he'll get out
[1:34:55] so if you're in a dead Church move
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:12] brother Ron but that's difficult how
[1:35:15] many of you moved from four hours away
[1:35:16] could you stand real quick
[1:35:24] was it worth it
[1:35:27] you just moved this week
[1:35:30] was it worth it
[1:35:34] give them a good hand
[1:35:46] brother Jordan and sister Kirsten I'd
[1:35:48] like for them to stand
[1:35:51] they came from one of the greatest Cults
[1:35:53] that you can be in
[1:35:55] it was a cult
[1:35:58] they moved here
[1:36:01] with the clothes on their back
[1:36:07] I baptized them
[1:36:10] won't you guys stand to
[1:36:12] I baptized them
[1:36:15] old order clothes
[1:36:19] baptized them in order to close as a
[1:36:22] matter of fact when they first moved
[1:36:24] here they had nothing I'm not putting
[1:36:25] them in a bad spot
[1:36:27] but they were willing to give it all up
[1:36:32] they were willing to give all of that up
[1:36:35] to come here with nothing
[1:36:44] a couple of years ago you can be seated
[1:36:46] a couple years ago
[1:36:49] you know when I saw brother Jordan when
[1:36:51] he first came here he had difficulty
[1:36:53] clapping his hands
[1:36:55] and I watched him and he's one of the
[1:36:58] most athletic people that I I've ever
[1:37:00] seen
[1:37:02] just play a sport with him
[1:37:06] that guy is an athlete
[1:37:09] but because he came out of a dead Church
[1:37:14] listen we had a convention here
[1:37:17] I'd never seen nothing like it he came
[1:37:20] running around here and he didn't dodge
[1:37:22] this thing right here he did a flip
[1:37:28] I told brother Donnie Reagan I said I
[1:37:31] never taught him to do that because I
[1:37:32] can't do it
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] but I said can you imagine he came from
[1:37:39] a church
[1:37:43] we were just at a place the other day
[1:37:45] with a thousand people and I could hear
[1:37:47] my best day manner with a thousand
[1:37:50] people
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:37:59] Hallelujah
[1:38:01] we are not ashamed
[1:38:04] I say it we are not ashamed
[1:38:25] and I want to say this to you I refuse
[1:38:30] to let them take a razor
[1:38:32] and cut our worship off
[1:38:36] I refuse
[1:38:38] I refuse
[1:38:41] I refuse
[1:38:43] I am not ashamed to worship God
[1:38:49] brother on when we get there we're going
[1:38:51] to worship what about now
[1:38:54] what about now
[1:38:56] what about now

[1:39:08] that we're overcoming cancer one day at
[1:39:12] a time

[1:39:15] [Applause]
[1:39:22] go ahead praise the Lord go ahead
[1:39:36] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:39] [Applause]
[1:39:51] I don't want an easy beliefism
[1:39:55] I don't want somebody to come in and
[1:39:57] preach way over top of my head that you
[1:39:59] can't understand
[1:40:00] how about something that will move on
[1:40:03] the inside of my heart
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:15] we're moving the tapes out
[1:40:17] but that's not the sign that we don't
[1:40:19] want you to listen to tapes
[1:40:22] many of those tapes we helped put in
[1:40:25] this building
[1:40:26] 40 years ago
[1:40:29] but now you can have a card now you can
[1:40:31] have a now you can have a little
[1:40:33] computer now it's on your phone
[1:40:36] it's on your phone
[1:40:39] six-year-olds has got phones anymore I
[1:40:42] don't agree with you about six year olds
[1:40:43] it's got phones anymore and you can
[1:40:46] listen to the prophet of God on your
[1:40:48] phone in your car in your library you
[1:40:50] can listen to it anywhere any place at
[1:40:53] any time
[1:40:55] you can listen to it at night
[1:40:59] I wake up and hear Brother Brown and
[1:41:01] preaching because Connie's can't sleep
[1:41:03] and then when I hear Brother Randall
[1:41:05] preaching I get anointed I'm hearing the
[1:41:07] word of God one quote after another
[1:41:09] quote then I'm awake
[1:41:14] but I will never tell her to turn it off
[1:41:20] I want you to listen to tapes
[1:41:24] but it'll never replace them live
[1:41:26] preaching in this pulpit
[1:41:28] [Applause]
[1:41:44] there's a reason why we're doing that
[1:41:47] you know maybe you're away from here you
[1:41:49] don't know the logistics of this
[1:41:51] building
[1:41:52] we're getting full here
[1:41:54] we're getting full of people that what I
[1:41:56] prayed for people that want to worship
[1:41:58] God
[1:41:59] people that are happy to come to church
[1:42:01] people that cause no drama
[1:42:05] and if you live somewhere another and
[1:42:07] you're nothing but a drama stay where
[1:42:10] you're at
[1:42:12] I will go into cycloth and Ashes
[1:42:25] I wasn't kidding
[1:42:27] I was again
[1:42:36] Samson never thought
[1:42:39] he'd be at a grinding meal
[1:42:43] never thought
[1:42:46] can you imagine his memories he's blind
[1:42:49] now I won't be much longer he's blind
[1:42:51] now
[1:42:55] and he's pushing
[1:42:58] against the post
[1:43:00] that is turning the meal
[1:43:03] to feed the Philistines
[1:43:07] history tells us
[1:43:10] that it was a meal that was in the Town
[1:43:12] Square
[1:43:14] this is the place where they put
[1:43:16] prisoners
[1:43:18] and it was also a place where people
[1:43:20] this is hard for me to believe but it
[1:43:22] was a place to where people could walk
[1:43:24] up and make fun of the people that was
[1:43:26] grinding
[1:43:28] the devil will do to you
[1:43:30] once he talks you into sin then he'll
[1:43:33] he'll call the police on you
[1:43:36] he'll be go before God and tell God what
[1:43:39] you've did
[1:43:42] and and he was pushing he didn't have
[1:43:45] five or six other people with him he was
[1:43:47] alone pushing
[1:43:50] no preachers no prophets were there
[1:43:52] encouraging him he was alone
[1:43:56] and he's pushing
[1:44:00] and he's pushing
[1:44:04] it seemed like an eternity one day would
[1:44:06] be an eternity to me
[1:44:12] it was like God told me he said hell's
[1:44:14] Eternal I said you better you better
[1:44:16] pray it ain't the way you're living
[1:44:18] you've been afraid of the internal
[1:44:26] and Samson they had shaved his head
[1:44:28] because that's where his strength was at
[1:44:32] that's not talking about you
[1:44:35] they had shaved his head
[1:44:37] and he had Seven Locks
[1:44:40] on his back
[1:44:41] that went down his back
[1:44:44] and whenever he felt weak he could reach
[1:44:47] back and touch those locks and he would
[1:44:49] become anointed again
[1:44:53] and he would have Victory after victory
[1:44:56] and we get tired and he'd touch those
[1:44:58] locks
[1:44:59] and those locks he would bounce on his
[1:45:01] back and he could feel
[1:45:04] as long as I'm got them God's with me
[1:45:11] any
[1:45:13] and he began to dabble in sin he noted
[1:45:16] it wasn't right Hey listen to Drunk the
[1:45:19] homeless man
[1:45:21] knows there are certain things that
[1:45:23] ain't right
[1:45:24] but he don't have God to help him to
[1:45:26] overcome
[1:45:27] I'm not throwing a stone at them I'm
[1:45:29] preaching the gospel that'll clean them
[1:45:31] up
[1:45:34] but but Samson kept dabbling
[1:45:37] and for a while he got by with it
[1:45:42] he'd break the he'd break the courts
[1:45:46] and he would go back
[1:45:48] well nobody knows they think I'm a hero
[1:45:51] so he would wind up back into Lala's
[1:45:54] house again
[1:45:55] and then she would ask him where's your
[1:45:58] secret
[1:45:59] and she began to she began to pasture
[1:46:02] him
[1:46:03] and she pastured him and he got in his
[1:46:06] flesh to where it was vexing him unto
[1:46:08] death
[1:46:11] and finally
[1:46:13] he gave up his secret
[1:46:17] polished his church up
[1:46:20] to where it be just like the Baptist
[1:46:24] you see where we link around
[1:46:28] say brother on you you're going back 20
[1:46:30] years you don't know what I dealt with
[1:46:33] 20 years ago
[1:46:35] and the leadership of that church
[1:46:38] is now in believe the sign
[1:46:45] and and listen it blinded a lot of
[1:46:49] people
[1:46:50] with their psychology
[1:46:55] I do not want to link up with that
[1:46:58] do you know how thrilled that I set when
[1:47:01] I heard brother Timothy preach and
[1:47:04] Andrew preach and they preached with the
[1:47:06] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:10] listen I know what this word will
[1:47:11] produce
[1:47:13] I don't need Dr Dobson
[1:47:17] I don't need the psychologist the world
[1:47:19] to mix it in to make it feel good
[1:47:22] I don't need the shiny tooth pastor
[1:47:25] that went from 3000 to 66 000 people
[1:47:29] I'm not looking for that kind of kingdom
[1:47:32] I'm looking for the kind of people that
[1:47:34] are getting ready for a rapture
[1:47:38] [Applause]
[1:47:40] can you imagine the thoughts
[1:47:45] of what it's like
[1:47:47] to push that meal
[1:47:49] and remember a thousand people dying at
[1:47:53] your hands
[1:47:56] carrying the gates of the city
[1:47:59] you talking about a haunted feeling
[1:48:05] how many decades can people live
[1:48:08] trying to sear their conscience
[1:48:12] to where they don't feel the pain
[1:48:13] anymore
[1:48:16] I made a statement here
[1:48:18] you made a choice look where you'll be
[1:48:21] five years from today
[1:48:25] look where you'll be five years from
[1:48:27] today I was at the County Fair
[1:48:30] and this girl came running up to us and
[1:48:33] saying hello
[1:48:35] I had no clue who she was
[1:48:39] no clue
[1:48:42] no clue
[1:48:44] I had no idea
[1:48:47] and when she walks away I looked at
[1:48:49] Connie
[1:48:55] Connie's going to blame me don't blame
[1:48:56] me don't believe me don't believe me
[1:49:03] who's she going to get
[1:49:09] Nancy's going I had her I had her

[1:49:28] there will be funnel cake
[1:49:30] in heaven
[1:49:33] with sugar all on top of it too
[1:49:37] there'll be strawberries and cherries
[1:49:40] Maybe
[1:49:51] sister Connie is not going to fix me no
[1:49:53] dinner
[1:49:55] and I turned to Whitney and I said
[1:49:57] Whitney we were going to the duck
[1:49:59] building
[1:50:00] because Zoe loves ducks
[1:50:05] Ducks she's in love with Donald Duck
[1:50:12] like your daughter is in love with pigs
[1:50:16] later on she gonna figure out what you
[1:50:18] do with them pigs
[1:50:22] but Zoe's loving Ducks right now she
[1:50:25] just danced in front of them Ducks but I
[1:50:28] asked her I said who is that
[1:50:30] see you know her I said no I don't know
[1:50:32] her
[1:50:34] she said that's so-and-so I said are you
[1:50:37] serious
[1:50:39] you see now I was getting a glimpse five
[1:50:41] years later
[1:50:44] I want to say this to you before I go
[1:50:46] too far sin
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:50:51] sin will take you further than you ever
[1:50:54] thought
[1:50:59] you can't sin and get by with it it will
[1:51:02] take you further than you ever thought
[1:51:04] you'd go
[1:51:07] brother on I didn't mean to do this and
[1:51:08] I didn't mean it Judas didn't mean to
[1:51:10] kill Jesus
[1:51:13] but he lined himself up with the modern
[1:51:15] church and they gave him money for what
[1:51:18] he did he couldn't live with himself so
[1:51:21] he went and hung himself on a tree
[1:51:28] foreign
[1:51:31] listen Samson begin to decide
[1:51:36] I know where I messed up
[1:51:39] and he began to believe
[1:51:41] and brother Brandon preaches this sermon
[1:51:43] on many occasions
[1:51:46] and he makes some real points he said he
[1:51:48] began to pray and he's admonishing the
[1:51:50] churches that he's preaching go back
[1:51:54] go back to where you left him
[1:51:56] go back to where you left him that
[1:51:59] formal that formal worship go back
[1:52:03] to the Holy Ghost go back
[1:52:07] ichabod's written over your door go back
[1:52:11] and he's telling them go back get your
[1:52:14] Holy Ghost Field preacher
[1:52:17] get your board out get your Holy Ghost
[1:52:20] Field leadership in your church
[1:52:29] Samson knew what it would cost him
[1:52:33] his own life
[1:52:36] brother Ron but I have to make difficult
[1:52:38] decisions my family might leave me
[1:52:44] and
[1:52:48] and
[1:52:53] my wife decides I don't want this no
[1:52:55] more and
[1:52:58] and if I wind up in a tent I'm still
[1:53:01] going to believe this word
[1:53:06] this word is worth more than anything in
[1:53:10] the world
[1:53:27] let me just drop something right here
[1:53:30] in the office of brother Ed
[1:53:31] hammermeister
[1:53:34] I knew who the young man was
[1:53:36] but he wanted he wanted to hook
[1:53:39] and he walked in
[1:53:42] he said brother Ron all I want is a hug
[1:53:45] I had preached to him for years in
[1:53:48] Switzerland
[1:53:49] and he would been one of the
[1:53:51] interpreters there
[1:53:53] brother Andrew it shattered my heart
[1:53:58] you know all this
[1:53:59] it shattered my heart
[1:54:03] he was from Ukraine
[1:54:06] and his his place
[1:54:09] is utter nothing but ashes
[1:54:13] but his wife decided I don't want no
[1:54:16] more of this
[1:54:18] and he said I gotta move where this is
[1:54:20] alive
[1:54:21] and he moved to air to hammermeister's
[1:54:24] church
[1:54:25] one of the best a manners in the
[1:54:27] building
[1:54:30] he's alone if his family wants nothing
[1:54:33] to do with him but he chose this
[1:54:36] [Applause]
[1:54:37] he chose this listen he made
[1:54:40] phenomenally difficult choices
[1:54:46] no hope to get her back no hope to get
[1:54:49] his family back
[1:54:53] I'll take the way with God's despised
[1:54:55] View
[1:54:58] listen his name
[1:55:00] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:55:03] there's going to be great reward for him
[1:55:06] some of you have paid some incredible
[1:55:07] price but there's going to be great
[1:55:09] reward for you
[1:55:13] now Sampson had come to the point in his
[1:55:15] life
[1:55:17] to where now
[1:55:20] he could feel
[1:55:21] the locks on his back
[1:55:26] and his enemy
[1:55:29] no longer was shaving him
[1:55:34] now he's pushing
[1:55:37] and he's had a prayer meeting
[1:55:40] and in that prayer meeting he says
[1:55:42] what's more
[1:55:46] I don't need a dozen more
[1:55:48] once more
[1:55:50] once more let me fill your spirit one
[1:55:53] more time
[1:55:55] when they invited him to make sport of
[1:55:57] him
[1:55:59] they didn't realize
[1:56:01] that his once more was getting ready to
[1:56:04] happen
[1:56:06] when a little child was leading him
[1:56:10] was leading him into the Coliseum and
[1:56:13] they were going to make fun of him today
[1:56:16] oh they were worshiping all they were no
[1:56:19] doubt had their music oh no matter they
[1:56:21] had their great leaders calling our
[1:56:24] enemy we're going to let our enemy make
[1:56:26] sport today
[1:56:28] we took the gods he said he had servant
[1:56:32] the Living God the only living and true
[1:56:34] God
[1:56:35] we captured him look what he looks like
[1:56:38] he's blind and having to be led by a
[1:56:41] little child
[1:56:43] but that little child brother Randy was
[1:56:46] leading him to the right spot
[1:56:48] that child did not have a architect
[1:56:51] degree
[1:56:53] nor an engineering degree but God
[1:56:56] anointed that child
[1:56:58] to where that that child would know
[1:57:01] which two pillars
[1:57:04] that that whole building would stand on
[1:57:09] I've often asked myself the question and
[1:57:11] I'll ask it when I get to heaven what
[1:57:13] happened to that little child
[1:57:16] I'd really like to know
[1:57:21] and he began to pray
[1:57:23] and he put his hands on the pillow
[1:57:30] can you imagine
[1:57:32] what it felt like
[1:57:35] brother Greg
[1:57:38] it must have been such a phenomenal
[1:57:40] feeling to him he knew he was going to
[1:57:43] die
[1:57:44] he knew that
[1:57:45] that's all right that's all right
[1:57:48] I want to die with this anointing
[1:57:51] I'm happy I'm happy with this
[1:57:53] I'm happy with this
[1:57:55] and he put one hand on one pillar
[1:57:58] and he put another hand on another
[1:57:59] pillar
[1:58:01] he prays that prayer one more time
[1:58:04] once more
[1:58:06] can you imagine what it felt like
[1:58:09] when he began to feel those pillars move
[1:58:13] can I compare it just for a moment to
[1:58:15] Noah feeling that Ark
[1:58:18] beginning to float
[1:58:21] can I take you back to Abraham and Sarah
[1:58:23] looking in the mirror
[1:58:25] and they're young again
[1:58:29] can I can I just go to this spot when
[1:58:33] Jesus looks at the Devil and says give
[1:58:35] me the keys

[1:58:48] Hallelujah
[1:58:50] this wasn't the end for Samson
[1:58:52] his Champion would walk to his prison
