[26:22] What a mighty conqueror you are. And
[26:25] Father, when we come approaching you,
[26:27] Lord, we realize, Lord, that we're

[26:30] But Father, we look at our sacrifice.
[26:32] We're identified with our sacrifice. as

[27:00] be low in spirit. We're praying for
[27:03] them, Lord, that Father, who [music]

[27:09] there's so many needs, but Father,
[27:10] you're such a great God that you will
[27:12] meet every need. And Father, the ones
[27:15] that are fighting cancer, [music] Lord,
[27:18] keep fighting.
[27:20] Keep fighting, Lord. I I just think
[27:22] [music] of our pastor, Father, every
[27:23] day, he just he fights.
[27:26] And Lord, I think of the ones that are
[27:28] around him that just has to maybe
[27:30] encourage Sister Connie. Lord, I
[27:35] Lord, what a reward she'll get.
[27:39] We thank you, Lord, for the sisters here
[27:40] in the church
[27:43] that stand for this truth.
[27:46] We thank you for the men, [music] Lord,
[27:47] that believes this message with all
[27:49] their heart.
[27:51] And Father, [music] we praying this
[27:53] morning, Lord, that your presence will
[27:54] come by, Lord.
[27:56] And Lord, just speak to us. Speak to
[27:58] hearts that father
[28:02] who needs a closer walk. Be with our
[28:05] pastor this morning. Lord, I don't know
[28:06] the condition, but Father, you know all
[28:08] about him. You know all how he woke up
[28:12] this morning. You know how he fought
[28:15] [music] this morning, but Lord, we're
[28:17] here to receive. And I pray, Father, you
[28:20] help him, Lord. Give him the strength.
[28:22] And may we pull from the gift. And Lord,

[30:56] God bless you, sister.
[31:26] As I kneel in [music] the darkness
[31:30] in the [singing] middle of the night,
[31:34] I'm praying for [music] assurance.
[31:39] Everything's going to be all right.
[31:41] [singing]
[31:42] Lord, I [music] see another battle
[31:48] out [singing] in front of me.
[31:51] I'm [music] afraid I won't be able
[31:56] and I'll go down in defeat. [music]
[32:00] He said, [singing] "Do you remember
[32:05] where [music] I brought you from?
[32:09] Just take [singing] a look behind you
[32:13] [music]
[32:14] at how far you come.
[32:18] And every time [singing and music] you
[32:20] ask me,
[32:22] didn't I deliver you?
[32:27] So why [music]
[32:28] would you [singing] be thinking

[33:32] Now she's [music]
[33:33] talking to [singing] her father
[33:37] in a house [music] that was just a home
[33:41] said [singing] my bills are coming
[33:43] [music] and due Lord it's stage
[33:47] [singing]
[33:48] that long
[33:50] she hears [music] a voice so soft and

[34:13] Then [singing] I call the raing sea.
[34:18] I spoke to the wind. [singing]
[34:23] It [music] hushed and I gave you peace.
[34:27] Then I run to your rescue.

[34:41] just so you wouldn't fall. [music]
[34:45] Didn't I [singing] leave all of heaven
[34:50] just [music] to die for your sins?
[34:55] I searched until [music and singing] I
[34:57] found you and I do it all again.
[35:02] [singing]
[35:04] Didn't I [music] walk on the water?
[35:08] Didn't I [singing]
[35:09] call the raing sea? [music]
[35:13] I spoke to the wind.
[35:18] It [music and singing] hushed and I gave
[35:20] you peace.
[35:22] Then I run to your rescue.
[35:27] Then [music and singing] I hear you when
[35:29] you walk.
[35:32] I walk right beside you [music] just
[35:37] [singing] so you wouldn't fall.
[35:41] Didn't I leave all [singing] of heaven
[35:46] just [music] to die for your sin?

[35:52] until I found you. [music]
[35:55] And I do it all again.

[44:50] you? comes right from the heart. It
[44:53] means so much when somebody's singing a
[44:55] song and it's got it's got stories
[44:57] behind it and they know what they're
[44:58] singing about. It's just as powerful as
[45:00] a preacher when he knows what he's
[45:01] preaching about. When somebody's singing
[45:03] and they know what they're singing
[45:05] about, I tell you, it's powerful when
[45:06] the Lord Jesus Christ vindicates right
[45:09] through the music, right through the
[45:11] song, right through the preaching of the
[45:13] word. And I believe that we're going to
[45:15] have oursel a good time today in church.
[45:18] I don't know about you, but I come to
[45:19] have church today. Have you come to have
[45:22] church? Amen. Amen. Let's stand as we
[45:26] get ready to change the order of the
[45:28] service this morning. Invite our pastor,
[45:30] brother Ron, to come and bring forth the
[45:32] word of life that God has laid upon his
[45:34] heart today. Let me have the key of
[45:36] Jesus.
[45:37] Amen. [music]

[47:16] Lord
[47:18] God.
[47:20] Almighty. [music]
[47:24] Oh, you are [singing] filled with
[47:27] majesty.
[47:29] [music]
[47:33] All the heavens [music and singing]
[47:35] declare
[47:37] your wonder.
[47:42] You are [music and singing] great.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Can you lift your hands if he's done
[47:47] something marvelous for you?
[47:51] For you [music and singing]

[47:55] are God.
[47:58] Can you testify to this? There is
[48:00] [music and singing] no

[48:08] Let [music] the nations
[48:11] declare.

[48:53] my king.
[48:57] And where would I be? [singing]
[49:01] God only knows.
[49:04] [music]
[49:06] I'm glad you see
[49:10] through eyes of love
[49:15] a whole case [music]
[49:20] and empty space.
[49:25] If not [music and singing]
[49:26] for grace,
[49:30] where would I be? [music and singing]
[49:35] God only knows.
[49:39] I'm glad you [music] see
[49:44] through us
[49:46] [music] as you come.
[49:53] [music]
[49:59] &gt;&gt; [music and singing]
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it again. Where would I be?
[50:09] God only knows.
[50:14] [music]
[50:24] Your heart [music]
[50:32] [music]
[50:34] if not [singing] for grace.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; I think every one of us could say
[50:43] I'm one of those people that
[50:45] &gt;&gt; was hopeless. [music]
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Was hopeless.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Just kind of drifting through life.
[50:52] That's right.
[50:54] bouncing off [music] different
[50:55] ambitions.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; But God, rich in mercy,
[51:00] &gt;&gt; took up the pen.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; You know, none of us have a right to
[51:05] look down at anybody [music] else.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; We're all here by his mercy.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Every one of us have a history.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; When we stand there, [music]
[51:18] we know what grace is all about.
[51:22] When we stand in that majestic place,
[51:24] [music] we're angels
[51:26] with their heads bowed.
[51:29] We know what [music] grace was.
[51:32] We didn't deserve it.
[51:34] But he was so rich in mercy.
[51:37] He came and helped us. Brother, I
[51:40] [music] can't explain all about God,
[51:42] we'll never be able to do that.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But all I can say is we love him. We
[51:48] love him with all of our hearts. Amen.
[51:51] [music] So good to see you this this
[51:52] day. Amen. So good to stand before you.

[52:29] to come. God knows how to get it here.
[52:32] Amen. Won't you just turn to your

[53:24] you know, maybe you maybe you don't know
[53:28] her story, but when you if you knew her
[53:31] story and you hear her sing like that,

[53:37] &gt;&gt; Boo devil. Amen. And God bless you. God
[53:41] bless you. Want to remind you that
[53:42] brother Roger continues to need your
[53:44] prayer. He and Sister Anne. Uh I talked
[53:47] to him on Tuesday night. We went to see
[53:50] him and then we talked to him on Tuesday
[53:51] night
[53:53] and wow through the night I just prayed
[53:55] for him and prayed for him, prayed for
[53:57] him and we text backwards and forwards
[53:59] and then then I talked to him I think on
[54:02] Friday. Sounded like a brand new man.
[54:04] and
[54:07] whatever the medicine that they gave him
[54:08] and the power of God just come and I was
[54:11] just so thankful to get it hear that and
[54:14] then a bug hit him and uh he got to come
[54:17] home but he's fighting a bug now and so
[54:20] he told me yesterday if we'd just hold
[54:22] off on any visitors coming to see him
[54:24] and I told him I would share that with
[54:26] you but we want to keep him in prayer
[54:29] that God would just just touch him in a
[54:31] special way. Maybe some of you don't
[54:33] know him, but he was a pillar of this
[54:34] church for a long, long time. Still is.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Still is. And and I know he's watching
[54:40] today. And and just praying. Amen. I
[54:43] know some of you guys have had some
[54:44] wonderful deer hunting this week.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Alvin and De Levi had a good week.
[54:50] And so uh they sent me pictures and
[54:54] Amen. And did you bring the horns? Did
[54:56] you guys bring the horns? And I asked
[54:58] them, "Bring the horns." We had we look
[55:00] at them things today. Brother Titus is
[55:02] smelling like a dough this year and so
[55:04] he's having a really good brother Jim.
[55:07] He hadn't hunted all year and went out
[55:08] yesterday said I'm going out and kill a
[55:10] deer. He sent me a picture about midm
[55:12] morning. I'm going brother Jim.
[55:16] Amen. Want to remember us this week.
[55:18] Many of you have had some incredible
[55:20] fortune with that. It's just Brother Ram
[55:23] said it's one of the ways that God can
[55:25] encourage us. I feel like I need a
[55:27] little encouraging.
[55:29] [snorts]
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we'll be gone next weekend for
[55:33] hunting and we do that once a year and
[55:35] so uh remember us and as we go and and
[55:39] uh we made friends with the people that
[55:41] we go to to be with in Illinois and so
[55:44] remembers us there. Amen. You love the
[55:46] Lord.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Have you come to have church?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Tell your neighbor, I have came to
[55:54] have church.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I enjoyed last night, didn't you?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Wow, that was great. [applause]
[56:10] &gt;&gt; We're so glad to have brother Matt back
[56:12] in the land of the living and uh
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so glad not to see him in that
[56:17] kind of pain and and thank God that God
[56:19] sent a doctor to take care of that. Had
[56:22] compassion on him and even operated him
[56:24] on him on Saturday morning. And so we
[56:27] was just so thankful for that. Same
[56:29] surgeon that took care of brother Thomas
[56:30] and he's an incredible guy. So we
[56:33] thankful for that. If you need to go to
[56:35] a hospital, Augusta is a good place to
[56:38] go to. And so Amen. Amen. Ephesians
[56:42] chapter 6. I was just trying to get the
[56:45] nerves out of the way. That's all I was
[56:46] doing. Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:58] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[56:59] Lord and the power of his might.
[57:02] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[57:04] may be able to stand against the ws of
[57:06] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[57:08] flesh and blood, but against
[57:10] principalities, against powers, against
[57:12] the rulers of the darkness of this
[57:14] world, and against spiritual wickedness
[57:16] in high places. For take unto you the
[57:19] whole armor of God, that you may be able
[57:21] to to withstand in the evil day. And
[57:25] having done all to stand, stand
[57:28] therefore, having your loins girded
[57:30] about with truth, and having on the
[57:32] breastplate of righteousness, and your
[57:34] feet shaw with the preparation of the
[57:36] gospel of peace. And above all, taking
[57:39] the shield of faith, wherewith you shall
[57:41] be able to quench all the fiery darts of
[57:43] the wicked, and take the helmet of
[57:45] salvation, and the sword of the spirit,
[57:48] which is the word of God,
[57:50] praying always with all prayer and
[57:53] supplication in the spirit. There's
[57:56] something missing in these scriptures.
[57:59] There's nothing to take care of your
[58:01] back.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; So, we're not going to run away. We're
[58:07] going to stand face to face
[58:11] &gt;&gt; and whip that devil.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says in in
[58:16] Revelations 3, to him that overcometh.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And I want to be one of them. Don't you?
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's pray. Father, Lord, we just
[58:26] look to you now. And we have great needs
[58:29] in this church. Phenomenal needs. And I
[58:33] ask you that, Father, that you would
[58:35] come on this scene and touch our hearts
[58:37] today and give us strength. Lord, we all
[58:40] need you. We could we could have a
[58:42] prayer meeting for the rest of the
[58:44] evening of the needs that we have here.
[58:47] But God, you're more than able to meet
[58:49] them. For there's nothing impossible
[58:54] to our God. Now we ask you that you
[58:57] would charge our faith,
[59:00] charge our confidence, minister to us by
[59:03] the word of God more than a feeling,
[59:06] more than just just words, but I pray
[59:09] that you would anoint us in a special
[59:11] way. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[59:14] ask you. Amen and amen.
[59:17] You may be seated.
[59:21] We ask oursel the question, how big is
[59:23] our God? Amen.
[59:26] [snorts]
[59:28] &gt;&gt; How big is our God?
[59:30] There is no sin too deep.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; There is no heart too far.
[59:37] God is able to reach further than we can
[59:40] ever imagine.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; That's a that's just a little words to
[59:44] encourage us that we don't have a prodal
[59:46] son or daughter too far away.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; He's bigger than all you fear.
[59:55] He's greater than all your struggles.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; He's stronger than every one of your
[1:00:00] enemies.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Our God is amazing.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He's not 10 miles million miles away
[1:00:07] from you. He is nearer than you could
[1:00:10] ever imagine.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; He loves to hear you call. The scripture
[1:00:15] says the Lord is near to all who call on
[1:00:20] him.
[1:00:23] Now maybe you might be able to you and I
[1:00:26] might be able to understand maybe two or
[1:00:28] three conversations going on at the same
[1:00:30] time. But can you imagine being able to
[1:00:33] comprehend millions of conf
[1:00:36] conversations, millions of prayers
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; and he hears every one of them.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; So he hears you when you call.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now remember this. Sometimes we we we
[1:00:51] downgrade oursel.
[1:00:54] We're not creatures of time.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; We're not creatures of time. Yes, we're
[1:01:01] born. We're babies.
[1:01:04] Brother William just showed us some of
[1:01:05] his young childhood pictures.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; His children look exactly like him. That
[1:01:12] DNA runs real heavy there. Just a little
[1:01:16] bit of you, Sister Gabrielle.
[1:01:19] the dark hair.
[1:01:22] The dark hair.
[1:01:25] And he showed us our baby pictures. He
[1:01:27] said, "Sometimes that feels so long ago
[1:01:30] and yet it seems like sometimes
[1:01:33] yesterday."
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Whether we live 10 years, 20 years, 90
[1:01:38] years, 110 years.
[1:01:40] Seen the other day there was a lady that
[1:01:42] was 106 years old, runs a jewelry store
[1:01:45] in New York. She works six days a week.
[1:01:49] Her daughter works with her. Her
[1:01:50] granddaughter works with her.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Has a phenomenal jewelry store business.
[1:01:56] She's still working. People love to go
[1:01:57] in and be with her. But at 106 years
[1:02:00] old, she still wants to live a long
[1:02:03] time.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine what eternity is
[1:02:07] going to be like
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; when you can sit down and talk for a
[1:02:11] thousand years
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; and you just kind of talk it all over
[1:02:16] and really you haven't spent no time
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; I don't think we can comprehend what
[1:02:22] eternity is going to be like
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; but brother on life gets a little bit
[1:02:26] hard it's only just for a little while
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; we are not creatures of time we're
[1:02:32] creatures of eternity
[1:02:36] Brother Ram said there was never one
[1:02:37] like him on the earth. There never will
[1:02:40] be. He was Emmanuel. He was Alpha and
[1:02:43] Omega, the beginning and the end. He was
[1:02:46] which is and shall come the root and the
[1:02:48] offspring of David, the morning star.
[1:02:52] In him dwelt deity,
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; the fullness of the Godhead body. In him
[1:02:59] was God.
[1:03:02] God Jehovah savior, Emanuel, the door to
[1:03:05] the sheepfold. He that was, which is
[1:03:09] shall come, the root of the offspring,
[1:03:12] the but the root and offspring of David,
[1:03:14] the morning star, the lily of the
[1:03:16] valley. Oh God, how wonderful. No wonder
[1:03:19] Isaiah said, "He is my counselor, the
[1:03:22] prince of peace, the mighty God, the
[1:03:24] everlasting father." Hallelujah.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "For he said, I
[1:03:30] am he that was,"
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; which is
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; and shall come.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; I am the root and the offspring of
[1:03:38] David, the morning star. I'm alpha and
[1:03:41] the omega.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's A to Z.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; In the Greek alphabet, I am from A to Z.
[1:03:49] I am I am all and in all.
[1:03:54] I am he that was and was dead and is
[1:03:57] alive forever more. I have the keys of
[1:04:00] death and of hell.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; He said every nugget you pick up, every
[1:04:07] nugget that you pick up and start
[1:04:10] polishing, it'll polish right back to
[1:04:13] our Lord Jesus.
[1:04:16] It plainly says here in revelations that
[1:04:19] Jesus is that which is
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; that which was
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; that which is to come.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; He is alpha and omega. Are you getting
[1:04:30] this?
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Which that that he is from A to Z and
[1:04:36] all of it. He is everything.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; The almighty.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; He is the rose of Sharon. He's the lily
[1:04:43] of the valley, the bright and the
[1:04:45] morning star, the righteous branch, the
[1:04:48] father, the son, and the holy ghost. He
[1:04:51] is God.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Almighty God,
[1:04:57] one [screaming] God.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you read it. It seemed like
[1:05:01] you was saying it over and over again.
[1:05:03] That was just in different places. But I
[1:05:05] want you to understand you are bone of
[1:05:09] his bone,
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; life of his life,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; power of his power, spirit of his
[1:05:16] spirit.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Everything that he is, you are
[1:05:21] [screaming]
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; alpha and omega. That which was, that
[1:05:27] which is, that which is to come.
[1:05:36] Let's just talk about him just for a few
[1:05:38] moments.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; How powerful he is.
[1:05:42] He is the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; The king of all kings, the Lord of all
[1:05:49] lords,
[1:05:51] and he's coming again.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Let's say it again. He is the lion of
[1:05:57] the tribe of Judah. He is the prince of
[1:05:59] peace. He is the great physician. He is
[1:06:02] the way maker. He is a giant killer.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; He is a chain breaker.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; He is our Lord.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; I got great news for you. Jesus Christ
[1:06:15] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:06:17] forever.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He is the Lord of glory. He is the lion
[1:06:21] of the tribe of Judah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; And he shouts from the highest heavens.
[1:06:35] Hallelujah. Jesus Christ is the king of
[1:06:38] kings.
[1:06:40] He is the lord of lords. He is the king
[1:06:44] of all kings.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; He is the prince of all peace. That's
[1:06:51] right.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes these
[1:06:56] earthly kings think they have a lot of
[1:06:59] power.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Ours right now thinks he's got a lot of
[1:07:02] power. [snorts]
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; There's a new king in Europe thinks he's
[1:07:07] got some power.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; There's kings all throughout. There's a
[1:07:11] Putin.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; There's a a new pope that is in the land
[1:07:14] that comes from the United States.
[1:07:16] I want you to understand, they don't
[1:07:18] even control their next breath.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; They don't even control their next
[1:07:26] breath.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But our God,
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; our God
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; that we're a part of,
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that thought of us before he
[1:07:39] said, "Let there be sun, moon, and
[1:07:40] stars."
[1:07:42] that thought of us as an attribute of
[1:07:44] himself. Of himself,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; not an extension, but of himself.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; I was in him before the foundation
[1:07:53] world. I was in him in a grave. I was in
[1:07:57] him at a resurrection.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; He is in me standing here this morning.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Woo! Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:08:09] [applause]
[1:08:12] Hallelujah.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; When we begin to realize that this is
[1:08:17] the greatest powerful people on the
[1:08:19] earth,
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; message believers, if you can grab a
[1:08:24] hold of how powerful that that God that
[1:08:26] is living on the inside of you,
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; we're not here for some temporary
[1:08:31] reason. We're here for an eternal
[1:08:33] purpose.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? We will rule and reign
[1:08:39] with him.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Glory. We will walk upon the ashes of
[1:08:48] the wicked.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; He is the conqueror
[1:08:56] of death,
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; hell,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; and the grave.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He's not only a conqueror of it, but he
[1:09:04] has the keys.
[1:09:06] And the devil that you fight on a daily
[1:09:09] basis, he don't have the keys to his own
[1:09:12] house.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:26] Who is this? It's Jesus.
[1:09:30] As brother Andrew did such an eloquent
[1:09:33] job, but Jesus is not wanted.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; You know, everybody wants a Jesus of
[1:09:40] their own imagination.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; They have a figment of their imagination
[1:09:45] of what Jesus would be to them.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; The Chinese people have a figment. I'm
[1:09:50] talking about the nominal world.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The India would have an affigment.
[1:09:55] America has an affigment of their
[1:09:57] imagination of what Jesus is.
[1:10:00] The Catholics have a figment of
[1:10:02] imagination of what Jesus is. But the
[1:10:05] world in the days of Jesus did not want
[1:10:08] him.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; They did not want him. Are you with me
[1:10:13] now? Jesus, if he would come back like
[1:10:16] he would do at that day, he would never
[1:10:19] become the president of the United
[1:10:21] States of America.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; They would not want him. But I got news
[1:10:26] for you. He's welcome at my house. He's
[1:10:29] welcome at this church. He is welcome.
[1:10:32] He is king.
[1:10:34] [applause]
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:40] This Jesus
[1:10:42] is a line of the tribe of Judah.
[1:10:45] This Jesus conquers death, hell, and the
[1:10:48] grave. I'm sorry I'm redundant, but
[1:10:50] that's all right.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; He This Jesus was a line charging out.
[1:10:55] This Jesus is all powerful.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Let me just drive the point. He is
[1:11:01] living. He is not dead.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; He is not a historical God. We don't
[1:11:07] have to look back to 2,000 years ago.
[1:11:09] He's here today.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; That's why I want to give him my best.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:22] He is a lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:11:25] He's our God and he's our king. I want
[1:11:29] you to say this to you and let's just
[1:11:30] say it loud. He's on our side.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; He's on our side.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; He will fight for us
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; against every alien and every enemy that
[1:11:43] comes against us.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Say it with me. He will
[1:11:49] fight for me.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; He won't run.
[1:11:54] He won't run in the heat of battle. He
[1:11:57] won't turn aside and leave you in the
[1:11:59] cold. He will fight for you.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; When you get in the fire, he'll get in
[1:12:06] the fire with you.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; When you go through the the deepest
[1:12:09] ocean, he'll be right there with you.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Our God has the power to overcome the
[1:12:16] flames.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; He has the power to separate oceans.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:28] I have to be honest with you. There's
[1:12:30] there's times to where that driving down
[1:12:32] 81 or 95 or these interstates, I get a
[1:12:37] little weary
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; at how long
[1:12:43] that it takes to build a bridge.
[1:12:47] [snorts]
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:51] how long it takes to put another lane
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; knowing they should put two more lanes
[1:12:58] instead of one more lane.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; I get weary how long stay with me how
[1:13:07] long that it takes
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; to do that. That's man.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; When I serve a God
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; that when Moses stretched his rod out
[1:13:21] across the sea, [cheering]
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know how long it took, but in
[1:13:27] just moments,
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; there was a phenomenal highway.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this just for a moment.
[1:13:36] We wasn't just letting out this church.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; But over two million people. Amen.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Turn loose
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; because there was Egyptian army
[1:13:47] barreling down on them.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And two million people crossed across
[1:13:54] this highway.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; That's how big our God is.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; That kind of makes you feel like you got
[1:14:04] hurt on your chest if you're a man.
[1:14:11] If it's the other way, we got some
[1:14:13] questions.
[1:14:15] [snorts]
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 18 and verse 10. Not
[1:14:19] going there. Proverbs 18 and verse 10.
[1:14:22] The name of the Lord.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. The name of the Lord is
[1:14:29] a strong tower and the righteous run
[1:14:33] into it
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; and is [screaming] safe.
[1:14:38] Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. Most of us
[1:14:42] probably have cameras on our houses,
[1:14:44] alarm systems on our houses, but the
[1:14:47] safest places you can be is in Jesus.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Nathan,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I don't know where you're at, but the
[1:14:57] safest place you can be in Jesus.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; When you were flipping your Jeep, the
[1:15:02] safest place that you could be was in
[1:15:04] Jesus.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When we've gone through
[1:15:08] trials, the safest places that you can
[1:15:10] be is in Jesus. Sister Wanda, the safest
[1:15:13] place that you can be is in Jesus.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Jeff, you're sitting in a good
[1:15:19] spot back there. The safest you can be
[1:15:21] is in Jesus.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; He'll be with you in some of your
[1:15:25] hardest storms of life. He's your
[1:15:27] doctor. He's your lawyer.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; He's your banker. He knows how to take
[1:15:32] care of you.
[1:15:37] Luke chapter 10 and verse 19. Behold, I
[1:15:40] give you power
[1:15:42] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:15:46] over all the powers of the enemy.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; I give you go ahead and stomp.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; 14 people stomped.
[1:16:02] Not 200 and so stomped. I want 200 and
[1:16:05] some people to stomp your foot.
[1:16:10] Sound like you're at the Dixie Stampede.
[1:16:16] The other day we talked on the weekend.
[1:16:18] We talked about Sister Connie stomping
[1:16:19] her foot.
[1:16:21] Let Let me just let me just go back and
[1:16:23] touch that just for a moment. Sister
[1:16:25] Conniey's never stomped her foot at me,
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; but she stomped them feet at them two
[1:16:29] boys right over there.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; She's my queen. She's the She's my
[1:16:35] buddy. Thank God she ain't stomped her
[1:16:38] foot at me.
[1:16:41] Notice what Brother Brandham says. This
[1:16:43] is a voice of a prophet. If God made a
[1:16:46] promise
[1:16:48] and God gave a promise
[1:16:51] and you believe it,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; this is where the important part comes.
[1:16:56] Sister Mary, God made a promise and you
[1:17:00] believe it. I don't care what takes
[1:17:02] place. It's yours.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Like the devil on every every ounce of
[1:17:09] ground that he stands. Walk over it.
[1:17:12] Take it. Take the sword of the word.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. God's promises is
[1:17:20] true.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[1:17:25] Say nothing with me.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing can stop them.
[1:17:30] They're God's promises. He give us the
[1:17:33] promise that that just like it did to
[1:17:36] the children of Israel. Pentecostal
[1:17:38] church has come to the kadesia and are
[1:17:41] we able? Can we do it? Jesus Christ is
[1:17:44] the same yesterday
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; today and forever. Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Can we walk up there and take a hold of
[1:17:58] God's promise and say, "It's the truth.
[1:18:02] I claim it. I own it. It's mine.
[1:18:08] God gave it to me.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Did you get it?
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; God gave it to me."
[1:18:19] Now I want you to understand when we
[1:18:23] come to talk about the message, this is
[1:18:26] your message.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; This is your message.
[1:18:33] God gave the message to you.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Are you with me? I grew
[1:18:40] up in the message and and and for a long
[1:18:43] time as I was growing up, you know, it
[1:18:46] was William Brandon's message,
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; but there came a time to where it was my
[1:18:53] message.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God delivered it
[1:18:56] through a prophet to you.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we said for a long time, God sent a
[1:19:03] prophet. God sent a prophet. You need to
[1:19:04] know more than that.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Let's just take Revelations 10 just for
[1:19:07] a little bit. It's important for you to
[1:19:10] know Revelation 10:7 that God sent a
[1:19:13] message.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; But there's also important for you to
[1:19:17] know that God himself in Revelations 10,
[1:19:21] he came with him.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; The mighty angel himself came to this
[1:19:27] dispensation.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Can I just stop here and just preach for
[1:19:30] just a little bit?
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; I tried it out on brother William just a
[1:19:33] little bit ago and he liked it. You like
[1:19:35] it? Okay. So when you hear when you hear
[1:19:38] brother Brandham talk about seals and
[1:19:40] trumpets and thunder in every age there
[1:19:43] was a prophet came or a messenger came
[1:19:45] to that age and delivered the message of
[1:19:47] the word of the hour Paul
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; and it thundered. It was the voice of
[1:19:53] God thundering to that age.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; When that thunder goes forth it creates
[1:19:59] a war.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; The enemy begins to fight that message.
[1:20:05] But the people hear the voice of God
[1:20:08] thundering through that messenger.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; 14 books he thundered. And then the
[1:20:17] people take thus sayeth the Lord
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; and they overcome
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; and they live through that age. Paul,
[1:20:28] Ireanius, Martin,
[1:20:32] Luther.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Luther was a man that was sitting within
[1:20:36] the Catholic Church.
[1:20:38] It's funny how God has his messengers in
[1:20:41] certain places.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; And then God anoints him.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; And he takes a word, one scripture, and
[1:20:49] that one scripture was the just.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Shall live by faith.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Some of you were Catholic in your
[1:21:00] background, maybe uh daughters of that
[1:21:03] Catholic system in the background. But
[1:21:05] listen, in that day, Luther began to
[1:21:08] scream to the world, "We don't need to
[1:21:10] buy buy prayers.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; We don't need to count rosary beads.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; We don't need to kiss a statue."
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; We don't need to do all of that
[1:21:21] Catholic. We don't need to confess to a
[1:21:24] man.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; We don't need a bishop to
[1:21:32] Come on, church.
[1:21:34] We can have a Bible for ourselves.
[1:21:37] [cheering]
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; We can be able to read God's holy word.
[1:21:41] [applause]
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard for some of you to
[1:21:47] know, but especially for our young
[1:21:49] people in Luther's day, nobody had one
[1:21:52] of these.
[1:21:54] But Luther was so con
[1:21:58] committed
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; to believing
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; stay with me. so committed to believing
[1:22:06] every [snorts] person,
[1:22:09] every individual
[1:22:11] should be able to look on this word,
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; God's holy word and read it for themsel
[1:22:21] and become the word of God.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about this.
[1:22:28] This is not going to be easily done. So
[1:22:31] men like Wliffe, other men became
[1:22:35] anointed under that angel messenger.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Now listen, they just couldn't take the
[1:22:42] book home and copy it.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; They couldn't cut and paste.
[1:22:50] They had to so memorize the chapter till
[1:22:54] they would go home and write it down.
[1:22:59] They would say it so much and it had to
[1:23:02] be exactly right.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You you know when the curt behind beyond
[1:23:06] the curtain of time, brother Brandham
[1:23:08] reminds him of what Paul preached. I
[1:23:10] preached
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; he couldn't deviate from it. Brother
[1:23:14] said, "I couldn't deviate from it
[1:23:15] whatsoever because we love the word of
[1:23:17] God."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; But listen, under that mandate, Martin
[1:23:22] Luther
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; couldn't deviate. The periods had to be
[1:23:27] in the right place. The commas had to be
[1:23:29] in the right place. Everything had to be
[1:23:31] in the right place.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Not only the hidden agenda of the word
[1:23:36] of God had to be placed there
[1:23:39] in such a way like the original writers
[1:23:43] because remember
[1:23:45] 40 writers.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; But all under that
[1:23:51] mighty one.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know I'm losing
[1:23:55] some of you here for a moment, but this
[1:23:57] is an important part.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Sister Beth, this is important part
[1:24:04] because you and I can take that word.
[1:24:07] And let me say this to you. Martin
[1:24:10] Luther was preaching justification.
[1:24:12] That's right.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; And justification, they come to believe
[1:24:17] that we don't have to pay for prayers.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; People died over that fact.
[1:24:24] Catholicism rose up against it.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; There was a German king that had to
[1:24:30] protect Martin Luther
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; or he'd have died.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Thousands of people died.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Are you sure, Brother Ron? Yeah.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; 68 million.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; You just visited the Jews. Six million
[1:24:54] Jews died. But under the Fox's book of
[1:24:57] martyrs,
[1:24:58] let's just preach. Under the Fox's book
[1:25:01] of mortars, 68 million Christians gave
[1:25:05] their life.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we can't give in.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That's why we can't be lazy layans
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; and just lay back.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; You got to fight for this. You got to
[1:25:23] fight for your your family. You got to
[1:25:25] fight as being be leaders. Fight as
[1:25:28] ladies.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; I heard Andrew talk about I heard him
[1:25:34] talk about those games that children
[1:25:37] play and become attached to. And then
[1:25:39] not only just children get attached to.
[1:25:41] Listen. Get attached to this right here.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Get attached to this right here. Oh, but
[1:25:49] brother Ron, I'm bored. Spend a little
[1:25:51] time in this right here. You're going to
[1:25:53] need it. [cheering]
[1:25:55] [applause]
[1:26:07] But even in that day, they really didn't
[1:26:10] understand what just really meant.
[1:26:14] But under the seven seals when Christ
[1:26:18] came down and met brother Brandham and
[1:26:21] that cloud appeared
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; and the book became open.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Understand? Through the ages the schools
[1:26:29] could not figure out the codes of the
[1:26:31] scriptures.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Boy, they tried to figure it out.
[1:26:35] Spurgeon. Spurgeon in his school would
[1:26:39] tell his men and the people that he was
[1:26:41] teaching, don't get into the book of
[1:26:44] Revelations, it'll take a prophet.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It'll take a prophet to come and open
[1:26:50] the Revelations. And God sent a prophet.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Don't take this for neglect. God sent us
[1:27:00] a prophet.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; We're not just another people.
[1:27:04] Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet to come and
[1:27:08] preach the word.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Why is that so important? To wash
[1:27:12] [screaming] us,
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; to wash us from our denomination ideas.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; To gather us
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; from every denomination.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Some of you were Baptist. Some of
[1:27:29] you were Pentecostal. Some of you were
[1:27:31] apostolic. Some of you were Amish. But
[1:27:34] God washes us.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; He washes our mind. He washes our
[1:27:40] traditions.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Let him go.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Let him [screaming] go. and take the
[1:27:48] word of God
[1:27:51] [applause]
[1:27:52] and believe it with a passion.
[1:27:54] [screaming]
[1:28:01] [snorts]
[1:28:17] Just
[1:28:25] You mean I don't have to pay for a
[1:28:27] prayer?
[1:28:28] That's right.
[1:28:31] You mean I don't have to count a rosary
[1:28:33] be?
[1:28:35] You mean I don't have to kiss kiss a
[1:28:38] statue?
[1:28:39] You mean I don't have to light a candle?
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; And then under the seals it comes.
[1:28:51] You're justified.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Not just just.
[1:28:59] Stay with me. Not just just listen.
[1:29:04] What brother Ron? What are you saying
[1:29:06] about 107 and 101? We have to we have to
[1:29:10] grab a hold of that cuz 107, brother
[1:29:13] Brandham, he couldn't preach this on his
[1:29:15] own.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; But the mighty angel takes the book and
[1:29:19] opens it up. It's not just justified.
[1:29:24] [screaming]
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And justified is as though you never did
[1:29:29] it
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; [sighs]
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Well, why is that important? Cuz you're
[1:29:44] a citizen of another kingdom.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; And there none of those things
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; will ever be remembered again.
[1:29:58] [applause]
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; here in this life.
[1:30:17] Here in this life
[1:30:24] in our humanity, we do stuff that's
[1:30:27] silly.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Becca, would you stand?
[1:30:36] Okay. You're talking to my grandson.
[1:30:41] Is that all right? I think the world
[1:30:42] probably knows that by now. I'm not
[1:30:45] revealing any mystery or hidden secret
[1:30:47] of Revelations 10:42.
[1:30:52] Could you stand? I'm not marrying you
[1:30:54] right now, so you just hang right on.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; At that age, everything is Hollywood is
[1:31:03] wonderful. But there's going to be days
[1:31:06] where there's silly stuff.
[1:31:09] Now, you don't understand that yet,
[1:31:12] but the oldest couple in this building
[1:31:14] says, "Yep, that's right."
[1:31:22] Okay.
[1:31:26] So, I use your toothbrush.
[1:31:29] You can't use my toothbrush.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; You wore that suit last week.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Same time.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; What's it going to [screaming] matter?
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:31:59] When you going to learn to comb your
[1:32:00] hair? Really?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Why don't you get you another pair of
[1:32:07] shoes? Silly, silly stuff. And every one
[1:32:12] of you just connected with me.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; How I know Jay and Alyssa has stepped
[1:32:22] into that world.
[1:32:27] Am I right? Am I right back there?
[1:32:29] Somebody say, "I'm right back here.
[1:32:35] You can be seated."
[1:32:37] Oh, brother. I don't want some, man. I
[1:32:38] want a man so bad. I can't hardly stand
[1:32:40] myself.
[1:32:42] Yeah, baby, you do.
[1:32:44] When you get that man
[1:32:47] and you wake up about 3:00 in the
[1:32:49] morning beside that husk of Varna,
[1:32:56] you realize this ain't Hollywood, baby.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you're a long way from the
[1:33:04] seals. I want you to understand God sees
[1:33:07] your silliness.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; He sees your humanity. that you struggle
[1:33:15] with on a day-to-day basis.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Too much butter on the
[1:33:21] bread and not enough jelly. Whatever
[1:33:23] edge you overfried my age. He
[1:33:25] understands all the silliness of life.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; And then we'll bring that to church. And
[1:33:33] we have to step from that natural realm
[1:33:36] into a supernatural realm for a couple
[1:33:38] of hours and then right back into that.
[1:33:40] That's why we got to be continuously
[1:33:42] washed.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:33:48] [applause]
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:34:05] Brother Brandon was going to preach the
[1:34:07] church ages and the seals at another
[1:34:09] time.
[1:34:11] In his earlier days, he did.
[1:34:14] And he honestly was honest with us
[1:34:18] before Christ came 63
[1:34:21] in the unveiling of his word,
[1:34:24] he said he was probing
[1:34:27] probing at it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And and for some of you that haven't
[1:34:32] read a lot of the message, there were
[1:34:35] times in his early I'm talking about
[1:34:36] 40s, 50s, the that he had three persons
[1:34:39] in the Godhead. There's times that you
[1:34:42] can you can find that
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; because he was probing at it
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; and he had a lot of ministers around. He
[1:34:47] was probing at it. He was probing at it.
[1:34:50] But once the author of the book, the one
[1:34:52] that wrote it is with him.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You're not just under
[1:34:58] the influence, are you with me now? Of a
[1:35:00] personality of a man, but once Christ
[1:35:02] himself came,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Revelations 10:1 came,
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; the one that wrote the book.
[1:35:10] Listen, there's nobody that can reveal
[1:35:12] the book like the one that wrote it.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Why is this message important to us?
[1:35:19] Because we're under the influence of the
[1:35:21] one that wrote it.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Now, you remember about 15 minutes ago,
[1:35:30] I said we're bone of his bone and life
[1:35:32] of his life and power of his power and
[1:35:33] spirit of his spirit.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Because he said that, not William
[1:35:37] Brandham said that. He said that
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; through William Brandon.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why we could
[1:35:44] stand in power and authority.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You were talking about justification.
[1:35:51] And when you realize that justification,
[1:35:54] you are as though you never did it in
[1:35:56] the first place. You'll come to a spot
[1:35:58] in your life where you don't dig up
[1:36:00] bones no more.
[1:36:08] Let me give you an idea right here.
[1:36:11] If you're going to have a happy
[1:36:12] marriage,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; If you're going to have a happy
[1:36:17] marriage, you never bring up an old
[1:36:19] boyfriend.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to have said amen here.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; You never bring up an old girlfriend.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; And if you're going to be married to
[1:36:29] Christ, you never bring up Methodist,
[1:36:30] Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; you move on. [cheering]
[1:36:35] You move on.
[1:36:39] [applause]
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, back when I was You're not there no
[1:36:44] more.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Back when I were there, we did it that
[1:36:47] way. You're not there no more.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; You're not with a boyfriend. You're not
[1:36:51] with a girlfriend. You're with Christ
[1:36:53] himself, the word.
[1:36:55] [cheering]
[1:37:04] He was answering a critic.
[1:37:06] How do you feel, brother Brandham, when
[1:37:08] you're standing there and you and you
[1:37:10] see people coming in different languages
[1:37:12] and things? Are you afraid? No, sir. No,
[1:37:17] sir.
[1:37:19] No, sir.
[1:37:21] He said so.
[1:37:24] Never been afraid yet because he told me
[1:37:27] so.
[1:37:29] And I believe it's the truth.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, are you afraid of cancer?
[1:37:34] No, sir.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; No, sir. I'm not afraid of cancer one
[1:37:38] little bit.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Cuz brother Random told us, don't fear
[1:37:42] it.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; If you fear it, it'll eat you up.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; But brother Random taught us, don't you
[1:37:50] fear it.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; God's more powerful than cancer. Are you
[1:37:54] with me now? Stay with me.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Listen. Cancer brings fear. brings a
[1:37:58] whole lot of spirits with you, but don't
[1:37:59] fear.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says. If he told me
[1:38:07] tonight
[1:38:09] to go to the presidential graveyard and
[1:38:11] raise up George Washington tomorrow
[1:38:13] morning, I would invite the whole world
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; come and see it done. I'd say bring
[1:38:24] every critic
[1:38:26] and stand them around and you're going
[1:38:30] to see the glory of God.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Set that chair over here where you can
[1:38:36] sit down and rest a little while. He'll
[1:38:39] be just in here in just a few moments
[1:38:41] when I call.
[1:38:44] I want you to think about that. Brother
[1:38:46] Brand was so confident.
[1:38:49] That's why he could stand and see a
[1:38:50] blind man and turn to the audience and
[1:38:53] say, which had a tremendous amount of
[1:38:55] critics.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Which one of your gods
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; can come heal this man?
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Which one of your gods can come heal
[1:39:04] this man?
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; And waited on them to do it.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Cuz he knew where he's standing.
[1:39:12] That's why we ought to be the most
[1:39:13] confident people in the whole world cuz
[1:39:16] we know where we're standing. [applause]
[1:39:23] Shake off your your your scared feet.
[1:39:26] Put your shouting shoes on. Know where
[1:39:30] you're standing.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:34] [snorts]
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; I wish you could feel half of what I
[1:39:37] feel right here.
[1:39:39] Jesus said himself, "If I do not the
[1:39:42] works of my father, then believe me
[1:39:44] not."
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; If I claim to have the anointing and do
[1:39:49] not the works of God, cuz I am the
[1:39:51] anointed by him with him, it's not me
[1:39:54] that doeth the works. The Father that
[1:39:56] dwelleth in me doeth the works. If I do
[1:40:00] not them works, then don't believe me.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; But if I do them, believe me.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:10] Now, that was for the Messiah.
[1:40:13] For Messiah, that's the church. Here it
[1:40:15] comes. Are you ready? John 14 and 12,
[1:40:19] Jesus said, "He that believeth on me,
[1:40:22] the works that I do shall he do also."
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[1:40:29] That's right. Messiah,
[1:40:31] the representation
[1:40:34] of Messiah on the earth. Well, brother,
[1:40:38] I've got to I got to call my favorite
[1:40:40] preacher. No. Why don't you lay hands on
[1:40:43] them?
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; I got I I got to get it. I got it in the
[1:40:49] presses. Listen to have respect to men.
[1:40:51] I understand that. I do.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; I do. But listen, I don't wait on my
[1:40:57] favorite preacher to come lay his hands
[1:40:58] on me or on my children or on my
[1:41:01] grandchildren or on you.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; We've been given authority to
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Janetta, when you David get sick, you
[1:41:09] can lay your hands on him, David, and
[1:41:11] say, "In the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:41:13] devil, take your hands off of God's
[1:41:15] property.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; You can shake the devil's hell.
[1:41:26] Mark 16, he said, "Go you into all the
[1:41:29] world and preach the gospel, and these
[1:41:31] signs shall follow the Messiah."
[1:41:34] Not that we follow signs.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; A lot of people get carried away with
[1:41:40] miracles and all different kinds of
[1:41:41] gifts and all kind of listen, they
[1:41:44] follow the word.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; He that believeth and baptized shall be
[1:41:51] saved. He that believeth not shall be
[1:41:53] damned. And these shine shall follow
[1:41:55] them that believe. How far?
[1:41:58] To all the world.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Who too? To every creature.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brandham pray.
[1:42:11] We've heard him preach. Let's listen to
[1:42:14] him pray.
[1:42:16] Satan. Who's he praying? All of a
[1:42:20] sudden, he's talking to the devil.
[1:42:22] That's
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Did you get this?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; And you got to know where you're
[1:42:27] standing.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; When you look the enemy right in the eye
[1:42:32] and call his name, Satan, you are aware
[1:42:37] that you are whipped.
[1:42:39] Oh, only Bron Brandon can do that. Oh,
[1:42:41] no.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; This is your example.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; This is your example.
[1:42:48] You you're driving the truck down the
[1:42:50] road. You come to a tight spot. You just
[1:42:53] start praying. Satan,
[1:42:56] you're aware that you're whipped.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Whipped. Jesus whipped him at Calvary.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus took the keys of death, hell, and
[1:43:06] the grave. Are you with me?
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; You're aware that you're whipped. You
[1:43:10] have no legal rights. Jesus Christ, my
[1:43:13] Lord, stripped you out of every
[1:43:16] authority that you had. He died at
[1:43:19] Calvary to take away sin and sickness,
[1:43:22] and you're nothing but a bluff.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; But, Brother Ryan, sometimes my mind
[1:43:32] gets kind of clouded up. He says, when
[1:43:35] your mind gets clouded,
[1:43:38] just rest in Jesus.
[1:43:41] The same God that gave you your first
[1:43:43] breath is watching over every heartbeat.
[1:43:47] I like it. Don't you?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus.
[1:43:55] When you can't see clear, this is for a
[1:43:58] in a battle. When you can't see clear,
[1:44:01] look away to Jesus.
[1:44:04] Don't look to your feelings. Hey, bring
[1:44:06] that t-shirt in here. I got a green
[1:44:07] t-shirt back there.
[1:44:10] I'm sorry, Matthew. Stretching you out.
[1:44:12] You've been sitting there too long.
[1:44:16] Don't look to your weakness.
[1:44:19] Look to him.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Let's do it again. When you can't see
[1:44:24] clear,
[1:44:26] look away to Jesus.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your feelings.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Don't look at your weakness.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Look to him. He's the word.
[1:44:41] Sister Kylie brought me a t-shirt last
[1:44:44] night.
[1:44:46] Feelings are overrated.
[1:44:53] Now, I didn't sleep in it last night,
[1:44:54] but this is a shirt I'm going to sleep
[1:44:56] in.
[1:44:58] When I wake up in the booger, man. I'm
[1:45:00] going to just tell him, "Read this.
[1:45:02] Feelings are overrated."
[1:45:05] And if we need to get 200 more, feelings
[1:45:09] are overrated.
[1:45:11] [applause]
[1:45:15] Faith don't look at your symptoms. Faith
[1:45:18] looks at the promise. When your mind
[1:45:20] gets weary, remember the promise and
[1:45:24] speak it.
[1:45:30] The scripture says then we are
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; when we are weak then we are
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; tell your neighbor when we are weak.
[1:45:49] The greatest battle ever fought is in
[1:45:51] our human mind. Amen.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; But when you place the word of God in
[1:45:55] there, it pushes out the doubt and
[1:45:59] clears
[1:46:00] the battlefield of your mind.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; I'm halfway through, but I'm going to
[1:46:11] tell you one more story.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I was raised in this message.
[1:46:18] I was raised in a preacher's home.
[1:46:21] My daddy understood the message
[1:46:24] early
[1:46:26] about about 61 62 he realized that
[1:46:28] brother Brown was a prophet Elijah
[1:46:30] through this age and so began to get
[1:46:33] tapes as long as soon as they were
[1:46:35] available and they were real to real. So
[1:46:38] me and my brother your daddy would stand
[1:46:41] there and when the real to real they'd
[1:46:43] flip them over and when they come off
[1:46:45] you you remember these they come off you
[1:46:47] flip it over. So we would try to come to
[1:46:50] a place to where we could quote what
[1:46:53] brother Brandham was saying as he was
[1:46:55] saying it. Listen cuz you know our home
[1:46:59] loved the message and so we would do
[1:47:01] that.
[1:47:02] That didn't that didn't cause our home
[1:47:05] not to have problems.
[1:47:08] [snorts]
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; My daddy was not a wealthy man. He was
[1:47:11] he was he he was upholster in a factory.
[1:47:16] Uh he was a farmer and not and you know
[1:47:19] his farm was not very successful. Just
[1:47:21] raised a few cattle, raised a few
[1:47:23] calves. He you know and and so there was
[1:47:27] meetings that were going on and dad
[1:47:28] loved to be in meetings. And so we'd go
[1:47:30] to meetings three we'd go to meetings
[1:47:32] seven days a week. Three or four weeks
[1:47:34] at a time we'd go to the meetings and my
[1:47:36] dad I could hear him praying in the
[1:47:38] night and he'd be speaking in tongues
[1:47:40] and and we'd be listening to the message
[1:47:42] during the day and hey listen we knew
[1:47:45] what was real.
[1:47:46] We had no excuses. We knew what was
[1:47:48] real. We saw cancers fall off. We saw
[1:47:51] people get out of wheelchairs. We saw
[1:47:52] people uh be healed with their ears. We
[1:47:55] we saw people be able to see. We saw a
[1:47:58] phenomenal amount of things. But in the
[1:48:00] natural life, my daddy didn't have a lot
[1:48:02] of money. And so he would pray, "Lord,
[1:48:05] provide us enough money to give us gas
[1:48:08] in the car." Listen, there were several
[1:48:11] nights to where dad would be driving
[1:48:13] home from church and be a fox laying in
[1:48:15] the road. He'd get out, get that fox,
[1:48:18] throw it in the back. When we got home,
[1:48:21] we'd skin that fox.
[1:48:23] I would hold one end, your father would
[1:48:26] hold the other end, and he'd skin that
[1:48:28] fox, go sell that skin, get enough money
[1:48:30] for fuel the next night, maybe for a few
[1:48:32] nights. We were really happy about that
[1:48:35] until he got skunks.
[1:48:38] Cuz
[1:48:40] there's a skunk season. You understand
[1:48:42] that? You know when them skunks start
[1:48:44] flirting with girlfriends, they get
[1:48:46] killed in the road. And
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; was it Hollywood? Oh no, baby. It wasn't
[1:48:54] Hollywood.
[1:48:56] My daddy took a trip because other
[1:48:58] ministers thought that every preacher
[1:49:00] ought to go to Israel. Dad had a pretty
[1:49:02] decent job. He was making pretty decent
[1:49:04] money at one time at a place called Row
[1:49:06] Furniture. dad took the job. He he went
[1:49:08] to Israel uh his only trip to Israel.
[1:49:11] And when he came back, that factory
[1:49:13] fired him from his job for going to
[1:49:16] Israel.
[1:49:18] Well, guys that made him promises didn't
[1:49:20] keep their promises.
[1:49:22] Guys that said, "We'll take care of you.
[1:49:24] We'll pay your salary. We'll pay
[1:49:25] whatever." They didn't keep their
[1:49:27] promises. Now, what that did to me as a
[1:49:30] young man,
[1:49:32] I figured out there's some preachers
[1:49:34] that are not real.
[1:49:38] I found out there's some preachers that
[1:49:40] won't back themselves up. And so when I
[1:49:43] become a minister,
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; I want you to take this clear. I want to
[1:49:48] be real.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; I want to be real to every one of you. I
[1:49:53] want to be real. I want these children
[1:49:56] to have as much respect as the oldest
[1:49:58] person in this building.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I am going to make
[1:50:04] mistakes. But I'm going to be honest and
[1:50:07] tell you the truth.
[1:50:11] My dad got another job and it was about
[1:50:13] half half the income. First of all, he
[1:50:16] wasn't making enough money, but now he's
[1:50:18] got half the income. My mom went to work
[1:50:22] and then as as mom, they were sending us
[1:50:26] to school and they couldn't give us
[1:50:28] money for food. And so what I did is I
[1:50:33] began to work in the cafeteria. Now
[1:50:36] listen, this ain't bad. I worked in the
[1:50:38] cafeteria so my brother and I could eat
[1:50:42] eat lunches. Now here's the big deal.
[1:50:45] And I wash dishes. I know how to put
[1:50:47] them things in that baby doll and pull
[1:50:49] that throw the water to it. Put the soap
[1:50:52] in there. Pull them out. And I do that
[1:50:55] for about an hour every day. The good
[1:50:57] thing was there was great big cinnamon
[1:50:59] buns.
[1:51:02] Are you with me? God is a provider of
[1:51:05] everything that you have need of.
[1:51:09] So I was eating twice the meal. So are
[1:51:11] you with me now? And I was getting all
[1:51:14] them honey buns. Woo baby.
[1:51:18] So don't feel sorry.
[1:51:21] But one day my dad was working under a
[1:51:24] very depressed situation. He was
[1:51:25] thinking about everything that had went
[1:51:27] wrong.
[1:51:29] And all of a sudden, he was so gloomy
[1:51:32] till a point come into his life. He told
[1:51:34] me, "I felt like going home and taking
[1:51:36] my life that evening." And he said, "It
[1:51:38] was so dark and so gloomy. I didn't know
[1:51:41] what to do. I couldn't provide." And he
[1:51:45] said, "The spirit of God began to say to
[1:51:47] him, why don't you just start praising
[1:51:48] me?" Come on. Come on.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; And Sister Beth, he just started saying,
[1:51:54] "Hallelujah. Anyhow, I'm not going to
[1:51:57] let the devil get me down. No matter
[1:52:00] what life may bring my way,
[1:52:03] I'm going to raise my hands and say,
[1:52:05] "Hallelujah."
[1:52:08] [cheering and applause]
[1:52:11] He shouted his way out of trouble.
[1:52:20] From that moment on, life begin to turn
[1:52:22] around for him.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; There may be some moments in your life
[1:52:27] that are things of the the corners will
[1:52:29] get close and the darkness will come in
[1:52:35] cuz life's got a lot of tough spots. But
[1:52:38] it's in those spots you go, "My God is
[1:52:40] huge."
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, let me preach to you. My God is
[1:52:45] huge.
[1:52:46] My God will make a way. Say it with me.
[1:52:49] My God will make a way where there seems
[1:52:51] to be no way.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:52:59] [snorts]
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; This is more than a dream. It's more
[1:53:01] than an illusion.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He's your God.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; He's your God. He's your God.
[1:53:11] In my young life
[1:53:13] believing this message and going to work
[1:53:16] at the Arsenal, there was a lot of tests
[1:53:18] that I had to take. Then I would went to
[1:53:21] become a chimney sweep and there was
[1:53:23] tests that I would have to take. Some of
[1:53:25] those tests was extremely hard. And
[1:53:28] here's what I prayed. God, if you're
[1:53:31] wanting me to be in this position, I'm
[1:53:33] not smart enough to do it. You're going
[1:53:35] to have to help me. Amen.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to I can't claim anything
[1:53:41] on my own. You're going to have to help
[1:53:43] me.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; More than a test. There's going to be
[1:53:45] spots in your life that you're going to
[1:53:47] have to say, "God, I don't know how
[1:53:48] we're going to get through it." But
[1:53:50] you're big enough.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; You're big enough
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; to send rainbows over top of my house,
[1:53:57] Sister Mary. He's big [screaming] enough
[1:53:59] to remind you, I got this.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; I like it when God says, "I got it."
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; I got it.
[1:54:32] I got it.
[1:54:38] The guy that's preaching this hears a
[1:54:41] lot of tough stuff every month.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now,
[1:54:47] I'm not preaching this by some illusion
[1:54:49] somewhere. Another
[1:54:52] preach where I'm at
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; for the internet people all over the
[1:55:00] place. If I can preach this from where
[1:55:02] I'm at, what about you where you're at?
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; What about you? Where you at? Moms, dad,
[1:55:09] leaders, moms and dads, let me just say
[1:55:11] this to you. He's with you.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; He's with you.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; He's with you in your battles.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to tell your neighbor right
[1:55:24] now, he's with you.
[1:55:31] I want to ask you, do you believe it?
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; If God makes a promise, there's another
[1:55:36] part to it.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe it?
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. If God makes a
[1:55:46] promise, there's another part to it to
[1:55:50] you.
[1:55:51] Not your daddy and mama,
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; not brother Andrew. Not the guys up here
[1:55:56] on this pull pit. Do you
[1:56:00] Do you believe it? There's going to be
[1:56:03] moments to where you have to show up at
[1:56:05] an emergency room and you're counting on
[1:56:07] a doctor to that's supposed to help you.
[1:56:12] How many doctors told you that they just
[1:56:15] sent you out and blowed you off?
[1:56:20] Four doctors the last couple weeks
[1:56:22] blowed him off.
[1:56:26] We prayed.
[1:56:29] We prayed. The only way that Matthew
[1:56:32] could get any relief is to lay on the
[1:56:35] floor, take his knees, and have Sister
[1:56:38] Cassie to push his knees into his chest
[1:56:41] for him to get a moment of relief.
[1:56:47] Are you with me now?
[1:56:50] How big is your God?
[1:56:52] How big is your God?
[1:56:55] We prayed,
[1:56:57] God, send us a doctor that'll care.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? God's in doctors.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; God's in nurses.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. God's in people that
[1:57:15] can help you.
[1:57:25] And he went to AMC because his
[1:57:27] chiropractor, our chiropractor, seen him
[1:57:30] to get an MRI.
[1:57:32] And then he went to AMC, called the the
[1:57:37] doctor's nurses. Hey, he didn't get a
[1:57:40] scheduler. He got the main nurse.
[1:57:42] You know how many times that you call a
[1:57:44] doctor and push 14 different buttons
[1:57:47] before you get a live person?
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; He made the call and the main nurse
[1:57:53] answered the phone not once but twice.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Come in 20 minutes
[1:58:03] they were working on him.
[1:58:08] They kept him when everybody else was
[1:58:11] saying, you know, give you a muscle
[1:58:14] relaxer and send you home.
[1:58:18] Listen, you don't need to blow off sin.
[1:58:21] You don't need to blow off just a little
[1:58:23] sickness. You need to ask God, "God,
[1:58:26] help me. [music]
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; God, help me. I need help. I can't do
[1:58:32] this on my own."
[1:58:34] and Saturday morning had an operation
[1:58:36] [music] to get him help.
[1:58:41] We've all been there.
[1:58:44] We've all been there.
[1:58:47] For three years, I went to the hospital.
[1:58:49] I went to I went to different hospitals.
[1:58:52] Three years.
[1:58:54] I got a headache that won't go away.
[1:58:58] Feels like my heart's pounding. feels
[1:59:00] like I can't get oxygen for three years.
[1:59:03] I was blowed off and my doctor says I
[1:59:07] had cancer [music] the whole time.
[1:59:10] But one day, God gave me the right
[1:59:13] doctor
[1:59:15] without an X-ray, without an MRI,
[1:59:18] without a CT scan
[1:59:20] because he [music] was a n missionary
[1:59:22] doctor. He said, "Ron, you got cancer.
[1:59:30] But before that, God told me, "If you'll
[1:59:32] trust me, I'll use you like never
[1:59:35] before."
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; So, I can stand here today [music]
[1:59:39] and say, "You don't have to fear your
[1:59:41] situation.
[1:59:44] You don't have to fear it." Whether it's
[1:59:46] a job, whether it's sickness, whether
[1:59:49] it's financial issues,
[1:59:52] more than all of that, whether [music]
[1:59:54] it's your relationship with God,
[1:59:57] you can lay the world down. God will
[1:59:59] [music] help you. Brother Ron, I don't
[2:00:02] know how to give my heart to God. Just
[2:00:04] ask him to come in.
[2:00:07] Don't ride the fence. Don't ride the
[2:00:09] fence tomorrow, next week. Say, God,
[2:00:11] fill my life. Fill my life. I need you.
[2:00:15] I need you, God.
[2:00:18] I need you.
[2:00:20] I need you to help me. I need you to
[2:00:24] help me. Be real to me.
[2:00:33] Hallelujah.
[2:00:35] Father,
[2:00:39] you see our hands raised [music] before
[2:00:40] you.
[2:00:42] many situations throughout this
[2:00:44] building, no doubt through on the
[2:00:46] internet.
[2:00:52] Lord, when we step into that realm of
[2:00:54] faith,
[2:00:57] Satan wants to battle, but we take the
[2:00:59] word of God
[2:01:02] and we remind of situations that we've
[2:01:05] been [music] through, that we're going
[2:01:07] through to build our faith.
[2:01:10] somewhere. We got to anchor a top post
[2:01:12] down.
[2:01:13] We have to take you at your word.
[2:01:20] We have to remind Satan that he's
[2:01:22] [music] nothing but a bluff.
[2:01:24] Don't have to have the keys to his own
[2:01:26] house.
[2:01:28] He was whipped at Calvary.
[2:01:31] By the stripes of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:01:35] we are healed.
[2:01:38] We are healed. And we believe it.
[2:01:41] [music] And we believe it. And we
[2:01:43] believe it. Father, help us today.
[2:01:47] Strengthen our faith today. May we lift
[2:01:50] our hands and lift our voices. May we
[2:01:52] lift our praise to you, Father. [music]
[2:01:55] Minister to us.
[2:01:58] Like my father saying, hallelujah.
[2:02:01] Anyhow, I'm not going to let my troubles
[2:02:03] [music] get me down.
[2:02:06] Lord, minister to your people, Father,
[2:02:08] today
[2:02:10] in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:02:13] Amen. And amen. Won't you just raise
[2:02:15] your hands and give him thanks right
[2:02:17] now?
[2:02:20] Lord, help me to put your word in
[2:02:22] action.
[2:02:24] Lord, help me to put your word in
[2:02:26] action. [music]
[2:02:30] Help me, Don.
[2:02:33] Lord, let [music] this not just be a
[2:02:35] sermon.
[2:02:37] Let this not be just a little time that
[2:02:39] we spent together, but Lord, put it in
[2:02:42] action, Father, and this wicked,
[2:02:44] idolatrous generation. Help me to be
[2:02:47] your representative.
[2:02:49] God, you sent me to be a representative
[2:02:51] on the earth. I'm not a representative
[2:02:53] of the United States. Sure, I'm [music]
[2:02:55] a citizen, but I'm a citizen of another
[2:02:58] kingdom, and we're ambassadors before
[2:03:00] God. Help us today in the name of Jesus
[2:03:05] Christ I pray.
[2:03:07] Jesus name we pray.
[2:03:10] Hallelujah.
[2:03:12] Jesus.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah. I want us to quote a
[2:03:17] scripture today. This scripture says,
[2:03:19] "If ye abide in me
[2:03:22] and my words abide in you, ask what you
[2:03:25] will and it shall be done unto you."
[2:03:29] Take your neighbor by the hand. Take
[2:03:31] your wife by the hand. Don't make you
[2:03:32] feel uncomfortable. I want us to quote
[2:03:34] this scripture. Now,
[2:03:38] this is a scripture that FF Bosworth
[2:03:40] would tell every patient that he prayed
[2:03:41] for and brother Brandham as well. And I
[2:03:45] want us to say it together. If you abide
[2:03:47] in me,
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; abide in me
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; and my words abide in you.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; You shall ask what you will ask and it
[2:03:56] shall be done unto you.
[2:03:58] Let's say it one more time. If ye abide
[2:04:01] in me and my words abide in you, you
[2:04:05] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[2:04:09] done unto you. Can you say, I believe
[2:04:13] that of all my heart. Give the Lord a
[2:04:16] good hand right now in Jesus name.
[2:04:17] [applause]
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; to me. [music]
[2:04:36] Oh, when I [music and singing]
[2:04:38] could not come
[2:04:41] to where
[2:04:43] he was, [music]
[2:04:45] he came [singing]
[2:04:47] to me.
[2:04:52] That's why [music]
[2:04:55] he died
[2:05:00] on [singing]
[2:05:01] Calary.
[2:05:04] [music]
[2:05:09] When I [singing]
[2:05:11] could not come [music] to where
[2:05:15] he was,
[2:05:18] he came [music and singing] to me.
[2:05:24] He came
[2:05:28] to me
[2:05:30] when I [singing]
[2:05:32] was bound
[2:05:34] in chains [music]
[2:05:36] of sin.
[2:05:41] He came
[2:05:44] to [music] me
[2:05:46] when I
[2:05:48] possess [music and singing]
[2:05:50] no hope
[2:05:52] with him.
[2:05:58] He picked
[2:06:00] me up [music and singing]
[2:06:03] and he drew
[2:06:05] me gently
[2:06:07] to
[2:06:09] his side. [music and singing]
[2:06:15] away [music and singing]
[2:06:17] today.
[2:06:19] In his [singing]
[2:06:21] sweet love, [music]
[2:06:23] I know
[2:06:26] God. [singing]
[2:06:30] He [music]
[2:06:32] came
[2:06:34] to me.
[2:06:39] He [music] came
[2:06:42] to me.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:06:47] [singing]
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; When I
[2:06:50] could [music] not come
[2:06:52] to where
[2:06:54] he [music and singing] was,
[2:06:57] he came to me.
[2:07:02] [music]
[2:07:04] That's
[2:07:06] why he died.
[2:07:12] on [music and singing] Calvary.
[2:07:19] [music and singing]
[2:07:21] When I could not come [singing]
[2:07:25] to [music] where
[2:07:27] he was,
[2:07:30] he came [singing]
[2:07:31] to me.
[2:07:35] Christ alone
[2:07:37] will [singing and music]
[2:07:38] glory.
[2:07:40] Though I could pride myself [music] in
[2:07:44] battles won.
[2:07:48] For I've been blessed [music] beyond
[2:07:52] measure
[2:07:55] and only by [singing] his strength I
[2:07:59] overcome. [music]
[2:08:04] Oh,
[2:08:06] [music] I can stop and count successes
[2:08:11] like [music] diamonds in my hands.
[2:08:19] But the [music] suries were not equal
[2:08:24] to the grace [music]
[2:08:27] for which [singing] I stand [music]
[2:08:32] in [singing] Christ alone.
[2:08:37] I place my trust [singing]
[2:08:42] and find [music] my glory
[2:08:45] in the power of the cross
[2:08:50] [music and singing]
[2:08:52] in every victory.
[2:08:56] [singing]
[2:08:57] Oh, let it [music] be said
[2:09:00] of me.
[2:09:03] My source [music] of strength, [singing]
[2:09:08] my source of hope [music]
[2:09:12] is Christ [singing]
[2:09:13] alone.
[2:09:16] Christ alone [music] will my glory.
[2:09:18] [singing]
[2:09:21] Only by his grace I [music] am redeemed.
[2:09:29] And only [singing]
[2:09:31] his tender mercies [music]
[2:09:36] can reach beyond my weakness to my
[2:09:41] knees.
[2:09:44] [music]
[2:09:48] I see a gater [singing]
[2:09:51] honor
[2:09:53] and just love [music]
[2:09:56] you
[2:10:00] and to my [music]
[2:10:03] [singing]
[2:10:05] for the glory
[2:10:09] of [music and singing] my Lord.
[2:10:14] My
[2:10:16] [music]
[2:10:20] place my trust
[2:10:24] [music] and find my glory in [singing]
[2:10:28] the power of the cross [music]
[2:10:35] in everything. [singing]
[2:10:39] [music]
[2:10:40] Let it [singing] be said
[2:10:43] on me.
[2:10:45] [music]
[2:10:46] My source [singing]
[2:10:47] of strength.
[2:10:51] My [music] source of hope [singing]
[2:10:55] is Christ alone.
[2:11:00] Christ alone. [music]
[2:11:03] Will I glory
[2:11:11] [music]
[2:11:17] [music]
[2:11:21] can reach beyond [music]
[2:11:24] my weakness
[2:11:26] to my knees?
[2:11:31] And I [music]
[2:11:34] I see no gater [singing] honor
[2:11:39] than [music] just know [singing]
[2:11:47] and to count against [music]
[2:11:49] the longings [singing]
[2:11:52] for the glory
[2:11:56] of my [music] Lord [singing]
[2:12:00] in my soul.
[2:12:04] [singing]
[2:12:06] I'll [music] place my trust
[2:12:11] and find my glory [music]
[2:12:14] in the power [singing]
[2:12:16] of the cross
[2:12:22] in every [music]
[2:12:23] victory.
[2:12:25] [singing]
[2:12:27] Let it be said
[2:12:30] [music] of me.
[2:12:33] My soul sold
[2:12:39] [music and singing]
[2:12:42] his Christ alone.
[2:12:46] Well, some have made Jesus a game that
[2:12:49] [music] they play to others a song that
[2:12:53] they sing.
[2:12:56] But since [music and singing] I met
[2:12:58] Jesus, well, I'm happy to say, well, to
[2:13:02] me, he's become [music and singing]
[2:13:04] everything.
[2:13:06] Well, to me, he's become everything.

[2:13:34] they play to others. The song that they
[2:13:38] [music] sing.
[2:13:41] But since I met Jesus, well, I'm [music]
[2:13:44] happy to say, well, to me, we call
[2:13:49] everything. [music and singing]
[2:13:52] to me. He's become everything. [singing]
[2:13:58] Well, he's everything [music] that I

[2:14:15] When I wake up each morning, [music]
[2:14:18] well, he's right by my side. And now
[2:14:22] he's my [music] last fall in mind.
[2:14:26] Well, he's joy for each [music] moment.
