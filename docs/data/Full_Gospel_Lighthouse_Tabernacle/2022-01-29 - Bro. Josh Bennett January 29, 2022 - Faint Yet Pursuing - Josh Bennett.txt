isn't it amen glad to have each and every one of you and our guests visitors here that are with us this evening we just want to welcome each and every one of you at this time we're going to receive this evening's offering this offering will go for the church but also we'll go for brother josh spinach we have brother josh with us this evening so we thank the lord for that as family and a lot of people from congregation coming in we'd like to ask caroline fisher and sister caroline fisher if she would come sing for us this evening and then sister haley cross she would come after uh after sister caroline sings at sea and if you would you can come lay here on the altar once you've given you can be seated this evening god bless each and every one of you i could before i sing while he's getting ready um i wrote this song a while back and we recorded it and the whole time i was recording it i thought about your pastor brother ron and i wanted to send him a copy of the song after we recorded it but i was embarrassed and shy and i thought he doesn't even know who i am and that would just be embarrassing so i never sent it to him even though i really wanted to so fast forward to last may um i got really sick and i had one thing after another and the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong and i had many really really bad days um one sunday morning when i was probably having one of the worst days that i had had my brother came to me and said he wanted to tell me about a dream that he had had he said way back maybe in april maybe but it was before i even got sick he had a dream and in his dream he was somewhere maybe at some meetings and brother ron came up and started talking to him and he had never in real life he never talked to him before so he was it was a neat dream for him but anyway brother ron said i just wanted to tell you that your is healed so my brother thought that was very odd because he did i wasn't even sick but um so so that morning when he told me about the dream um it was like this burst of faith came over me and um i said why didn't you tell me this before and he said well i was just waiting for the right time and it really was the right time because i'm right that was my turning point right after that i got the faith that i needed um the doctors found the problem and my healing began and um so then i knew i had to send that song to brother ron no matter how embarrassing or shy i was so um he had asked me saying this the last time we were here but i couldn't so i'm going to try it today but i just want to say miracles happen and when they do it's an amazing thing but but sometimes our calling is actually just to be healed it's to go through that healing process and it builds our faith and so i hope this will be a blessing to you they say it just takes time and healing's come but they don't know i'm on the verge of giving up i try to be strong saying lord your will be done but inside i'm crying lord [Music] [Music] oh but i will just believe for healing [Music] you have promised me and i know it won't be long just let my faith stay strong and i will love you through all of my healing [Music] now miracles bring hope to others when they see but in your time and in your healing you're building faith in me and i know you're right here though some days are hard to see i don't need an angel lord stirring the waters just for me for my healing lord i will just believe for healing [Music] you have promised me and i know it won't be long just let my faith stay strong and i will love you [Music] and if tomorrow finds me gone i'll just be standing by your throne and i will love you through all of my [Music] [Applause] are you weary from the battle you're fighting [Music] does it seem like the storm just won't break is there a mountain in front of you that doubt says will never move and you wonder what just tell me a time that he's not been faithful tell me a morning his mercies were new tell me a moment that he wasn't able to carry you through and tell me a day he was less than almighty when he could not roll back the tide child when you look back you're gonna find there was never a time so be strong in the lord and remember to take hold of faith and stand firm oh you can't be confident the lord keeps his promises if you doubt it just read through his word and tell me a time that he's not been faithful tell me a morning his mercies weren't new tell me a moment that he wasn't able to carry you through tell me a day he was a lesson almighty when [Music] there was never a and he can work miracles do the impossible if you don't believe it just go on and try and tell me a time he's not been faithful tell me a morning his mercies weren't new tell me a moment that he wasn't able to carry you through tell me a day [Music] there was never a day he was less than almighty when he could not roll back the tide and shout when you look back you're gonna find there was never a time your child [Music] there was never a time [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah aren't you thankful to know there's never a time that you can look back hallelujah he's the same today as he was yesterday hallelujah he is emmanuel he is mighty to be praised hallelujah give him praise in the house of god [Applause] [Music] of us what do you see [Music] looking our way [Applause] we are free in ways that

we'll be careful to give you the thanks in the praise lord will give you all the glory and all the honor lord because you alone are worthy we ask these things humbly tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen and amen amen if you have your bibles tonight i'll invite you to turn with me to the book of judges we'll be looking in the eighth chapter of the book of judges i'm just going to read one verse of scripture but if you don't mind just keep your your bibles handy and judges chapter 8 and i'm just going to read from the fourth verse and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the 300 men that were with him faint yet pursuing them may the lord just add his blessing to the reading of the word and you can have your seats tonight i want to just speak for a few minutes on faint yet pursuing i'd like to uh just read a a quote out of the message of thanking men's filter just just as we get started tonight and the prophet said he said church i realize i've got to stand with you in the judgment someday he said far be it for me to ever tell you anything wrong for popularity i don't want to do that if i had my desire i just my human desire i'd take my rifle and go out in the woods and build a cabin and just trap the rest of my life see i'm getting old tired weary broke down but i can't quit there's just something in me grinding he said woe unto me if i don't tell the truth and the whole truth woe unto me if i don't stand here till the last breath of my body has left me i must stand regardless of what anyone else says because i'm responsible before god amen i i believe i'm so thankful i'm thankful that the prophet didn't just go do what he wanted to do i'm glad that he didn't just go fulfill his own human desire but there was a call in his life there was something that was greater than his own desire and he said even when he was tired broke down weary he said i just can't quit amen because there was something driving him there was something greater than what he was even that was driving him and he said whoa unto me if i don't i thought about paul when paul said woe unto me amen if i don't preach the gospel amen there's a lot of people would love to shut up every preacher but amen there's some preachers that just can't be shut up amen amen and i believe there's some men there stand like paul and men that stand like william branham that just won't quit i love what brother brown said there he said i'm gonna stand amen until the last breath leaves my body regardless of what anybody else thinks about it amen but just to get a background of the text that we find tonight and the book of judges there i'd like to just go back and look in judges chapter six judges i know this is very familiar and and it's going to be real simple tonight but you know what i found that uh god is hid in simplicity and you know i i think sometimes if you uh there really ain't nothing new to preach and and i know you pastor y'all heard that some of the best preaching that's ever been done amen amen so i don't have nothing new to bring you tonight but i am here to stir up your minds amen tonight by way of remembrance and so in the book of judges there in the sixth chapter the bible says and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of media for seven years and the hand of media prevailed against israel because of the midianites the children of israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and it was so when israel had sown that the midianites came and the amla kites and the children of the of the east even they came up against them and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no substance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were outnumbered and they entered into the land to destroy it and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord and it came to pass that when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites that the lord sent a prophet amen i love that when the children of israel began to cry god sent him a prophet and and the prophet said thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drove you from out from before you and gave you their land and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites and whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the lord and said under an oak which was an orphan and that pertained to joash and his son gideon thresh wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou thou mighty man of valor amen i love that because when the angel appeared unto him the angel told him who he was and called him a mighty man of valor notice what the prophet said he said now we find out that when god's people gets in trouble god always sends them a prophet with the true word to bring them out amen how many glad god sent us a prophet amen how many would acknowledge that we were in a mess amen religion was in a mess this world was in a mess but thank god he sent a prophet amen a prophet with a word to bring us out amen brother brown said and here come a prophet out for the hour and gave them the word of the lord and remember he never gave them some man-made theology he said i'm the lord that brought you out of egypt i'm the one that showed you my mighty hand show my power and i could just imagine gideon was getting right there he was just he was right there listening at him and he said i'm the god that did all these things and i've done all this for you and yet you've not obeyed my commandments and in all this you have not done it and i want you to notice another thing that might encourage you immediately after the prophet's message the lord appeared on the scene he said amen as soon as he gave his message the lord appeared under a tree and the lord came after the message of the prophet see the people fell away and got off in their isms and god sent his prophet and as soon as the prophet got through with his message the lord followed the prophet's message for deliverance oh we're living in a grand time immediately when the prophet went off the scene what happened the lord came on the scene as soon as john went off the scene the lord come on the scene amen how many can see the parallel tonight how many thankful that god sent us a prophet he gave us a message amen but according to what that prophet said as soon as the prophet went off the scene the lord came on the scene listen church the prophet ain't here tonight but i got good news jesus christ is here tonight hallelujah amen the lord came behind the prophet's message for deliverance and i believe he's here tonight amen we read in the scripture we're gideon he was scared out there by the wine press threshing out enough wheat before the philistines or the midianites amen there and him and he was out there getting like a little uh grub for the winter's food thrashing it out secretly so they couldn't find them because they laying like grasshoppers for multitude but now gideon when when he's out there threshing his weak no doubt that prophet's message was just going through his heart what the prophet had said i like that amen while getting was out there threshing amen the prophet's message was running through his heart he meant he was thinking about something he wasn't thinking about politics he he wasn't so worried about what you know the president said he was thinking about what the prophet has said amen there was something running through his heart as he was threshing the wheat there amen that prophet had said i am the god of abraham isaac and of jacob i'm the one that brought you out of egypt i'm the one amen that gave you what you got turn to me see amen out there threshing the wheat and the angel come to him it was god himself see because it was a capital l o r d c he said and he spoke to gideon and gideon was a little bit surprised he said now you mighty man of valor see he didn't know he was and maybe you don't know you are amen amen i love that he said gideon didn't know he was a mighty man of valor amen and maybe you don't know who you are amen but that's why god sent an a message to him to tell him who he was hallelujah amen and the bible says that gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us then why then is this befalling us and where be all the miracles which our father told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites see i i don't think that gideon was necessarily judging god foolish amen but i believe he had a sincere question in his heart brother banham said it this way he said gideon said if god be with us then where's all his mighty miracles see the prophet told us amen he was a god that brought us out of egypt and smote the land and deliver to them and he's a god of deliverance and if he ever was god he's still god hallelujah and i say the same thing tonight if he ever was god he has to always remain god if he ever was almighty he's still almighty he certainly is the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever how many can say amen to that tonight amen and let me just say this amen if god was ever god he's still god right now and if he ever healed he still heals right now if he ever give the holy ghost he's still doing it right now the prophet of god said what he did he will continue to do until the end of the age amen because he is the same yesterday today and forever [Applause] hallelujah amen now watch gideon says here in uh or i'm sorry in the in the 14th verse and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the many nights have i not sent thee and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i'm the least in my father's house you know gideon was just like every other man he had all the excuses of why he couldn't do it you know he was just like moses i can't even speak and amen he was just like everybody else amen he had all the reasons figured out why he couldn't be the one even to fulfill the word amen but listen amen he said unto him if if i have found grace in thy sight then show me a sign i'm sorry amen i skipped a verse in verse 16 and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man amen i believe that god was telling telling gideon i know you're poor i know you're the least in your father's house i know you ain't got no ability amen i don't need your ability hallelujah listen church god don't need your abilities god don't need great people amen god needs somebody he can get in his hand god needs somebody humble enough amen that can surrender their life to him and let him take over amen because let me tell you it wasn't gideon that was going to win the victory it was god almighty that was going to win the victory church i'm going to tell you this tonight amen if we make it out of here and we are it ain't going to be by our ability it ain't gonna be because how great we are it'll be by the grace of almighty god hallelujah not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts we are what we are by the grace of god hallelujah amen i believe it with all my heart amen and notice this amen god said i'll be with thee and he said unto him gideon said if i found grace and thy sight show a sign that thou talketh with me depart not thence i pray thee until i come unto thee again and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again and get him went made ready a kid and unleavened cakes and he put put flesh in a in a basket he uh put broth in a pot and brought it in under the oak and presented it and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleaved cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up a fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes and the angels of the lord departed out of his sight now listen what brother brown said about that he said gideon after he had seen this visitor sitting under the tree he kind of questioned him at first he said if god still remains god if god be with us then where's his miracles and this visitor sitting under the tree what did he did what did he do he touched the sacrifice with a stick he had in his hand and it was consumed and he knowed that that was the action of god so he know that the visitor under the tree that looked like an old man sitting there was the word made flesh he said hallelujah it was a living word he knowed it was a living word because it was acting in the living present tense glory to god brother in other words the voice that he had heard was now vindicated amen and he knew this is not just another man i've met amen but this man has the action of god amen and now even the voice that he heard was a vindicated voice and let me just say i know amen there's all kind of thoughts and there's all kind of ideas about what this message is but let me just tell you tonight without apology the voice that you have heard is a vindicated voice hallelujah it's been vindicated by almighty god what we have seen is the action of god amen again in this day amen you have saul amen things happen amen that only god could do verse 25 and it came to pass the same night the lord said unto him take this thy father's young bullock and the second book of seven years and throw down the altar of baal that thy father had cut down in the grove that is bat and build an altar into the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullet can offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which i shall cut down in other words because remember get in and ask a question it was a good question if god be god if god be forest then where's all the miracles amen but i tell you i believe that we're seeing even a principle in the word of god right here you want to see miracles tear down every other altar destroy every idol cut down every grove come on friends you want to see a miracle amen amen come back to the word [Music] rebuild the altar of god you want to see the power of god in your home amen rebuild the altar in your home amen destroy every idol amen i i believe that even gideon now is moving amen under the commission of god amen and when gideon went and began to cut down the grove tear down the altars amen because they've been worshipping baal amen you know what the men of the city rose up in anger amen and they come to joash and said bring out thy son that he may die they wanted to kill him because he had cut down the altar of baal and because he cut down the grove that was by but i love amen the answer amen that gideon's father gave amen amen he said will you plead for baal will you save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death well as yet mourning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one has cast down his altar i think that's a good answer amen if baal is god amen let him plead his own case if he's angry because you cut down and tore down his altar amen let him speak for himself i don't know about the rest of y'all but i'm glad i'm serving a god that's got a voice hallelujah i'm glad that god we serve complete his own case he's not a god that man-made amen he is not a god of our creation he's the creator hallelujah amen he is come on church our god is not even depending on no man we're depending on him kind of puts me in the mind of when the ark of the covenant got taken up uh the philistines took it amen amen from israel and they took it down there and you remember you remember they took it down and put it before their god amen when they remember church i'm going to show you the power of the word there was nobody there amen in it [Music] there was no preacher standing there amen in agreement with it there was nobody saying this is right amen the word all by itself set before an idol brought the idol down [Applause] and their god fell on his face you know what's amazing to me about that amen that bunch went out there and picked their god up [Music] could you imagine amen them a bunch of crazy people worshiping that and oh god they aim and they went in there found their god laying on his face [Applause] and they picked their god up and propped him back up amen amen but the thing about is is they left the word sitting there and when they got back the next morning their god was laying back down again and his face was broke off and his hands was broke off hallelujah let me tell you something tonight church the god i serve i have never had to pick him up i have never had to prop him up but my god picks me up hallelujah he's the one that's holding my hand i don't have to hold him up i don't have to pick him up i don't have to prop him up but my god hallelujah when i'm sick he heals me when i was lost he saved me when i was down amen he delivered me that's the god i served tonight hallelujah it's in your god blessed be the name of the lord gideon's that gideon's dad said if bale's upset let him plead his own case if he's mad because they cast down his altar even let him speak for himself the bible said then all the media knights and the americas and the children of the of the east were gathered and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel but the spirit of the lord came on gideon amen the spirit of the lord came on gideon and he blew the trumpet amen and he sent messengers throughout all manassas and gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and to zebelon and neptulon and they all came and met them chapter seven and and we see here in chapter seven when even gideon had sent all out to the people that were with him and they rose up early and pitched beside the well there was a great host that had gathered around getting in there but the bible says in verse 4 the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many i mean you'll find that that in verse 2 god said the same thing to get him said there was too many and gideon said spoke to him and said anybody that's fearful go home if you ain't got a stomach to fight you're in the wrong place [Music] listen if you ain't ready for war you're you're in the wrong place if you come for a picnic the message pie ain't gonna fit you too good everybody that was fearful he sent him home amen but even after that god said there's still too many he told me he said bring them down to the water and i'll try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and whosoever i shall say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go so he brought down the people into the water and the lord said in the gideon every one that lap of the water with his tongue as a dog laugh at him shall thou sit by himself likewise one that bowed down upon his knee to drink and the number of them that lap lapped putting forth their hand to the mouth were 300 men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water now i got to remind you of something the enemy they're facing couldn't even be numbered according to the bible that they mean they were they come as grasshoppers as as multitude they couldn't even number their cat or their camels and and all these things amen and so they were already outnumbered to begin with even in the beginning of the seventh chapter the great multitude that gideon had they were already outnumbered as far as a natural accuracy but you see god said there's still too many and so he put them to the test now they ended up with 300 men and and and i want you to say this it's not always in the numbers you know people give the idea that strength is in numbers but strength is not in numbers even there is strength in unity but not in numbers amen but notice brother brown said amen he says as we're moving to the top of the pyramid we're getting in the minority all the time so it's getting less and less as far as in in numbers is getting less but the closer we get to the top in power the power is getting greater do you believe that that's why the prophet said give me a church just give me ten men who are really jewels of god the royal seed them men put together and i and watch what'll take place just give me a little house full of people like that and i'll show you a light that the whole world will run to it another place brother brown said this way he said he said i see there's not a year passes but what this great supernatural signs is striking the earth and we see it knowing that there's a great the great army of god marches on not many in number but what a powerful group that's got eternal life said they'll run through a troop leap over a wall yes the troop of death will have no holders to it she'll run right through it leap over the wall between the natural and the supernatural right under the arms of god amen he said that army of god not many in number but what a powerful group listen i i just want to encourage you this tonight amen you say in the last you know 10 15 years you said there's a lot of people walked away amen there's a lot of people walked away from the message amen but let me just encourage you amen listen amen we have not lost anything and i'm not trying to be little people don't misunderstand what i'm saying but we have not lost anything we have not lost power we have not lost anointing come on church this message is just as real now i say it's more real hallelujah amen and they they come along and say it don't work it does work hallelujah it is the answer come on church listen amen i know that men have took and made all kind of stuff out of it the message is jesus christ and it is the answer hallelujah notice as we as we look at this as gideon now is thin down his group the lord begins to give him instruction you know and you know the story of how that god even encouraged getting in and said he said go down there and he said just to you know give him a little a a little surge of faith gideon steps out and he hears the enemy begins to have a conversation that a man begins to tell how he had a dream and and the other man begins to say given interpretation he said that's nothing less than the sword of gideon that's that's the hand of god god has delivered us amen into the hand of gideon and gideon when he heard the telling of the dream interpretation he worshipped and returned to the host of israel and said arise for the lord had delivered into your hand the host of the median and he divided the 300 men into three companies and put a trumpet in every man's hand and emptied the pictures and lamps within the pictures and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come outside the campus shall be that as i do shall ye do when i blow with a trumpet and and and i and all that are with me then you then blow you the trumpets also every side of the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon the sword of the lord and of gideon and so gideon and the 300 men that were with him came outside the camp and in the beginning of the middle watch they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and broke the pictures where that were in their hand and the 300 companies blew the trumpets and broke the pictures and held the lamps in their left hands and the trump in their right hand in blue with all and they cried and they cried out the sword of the lord and of gideon and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the hosts ran and cried and fled and the 300 blew their trumpets and the lord said every man soared against his fellow even throughout all the hosts and the hosts fled and notice even as they begin to follow gideon's instructions they begin to scream out as they as they broke their their pictures they begin to scrap the sword of the lord and gideon amen that they the enemy began to flee now i'm just now getting to my text now even now amen gideon has got his little small narrow down group amen and and gideon is under the instruction amen uh of the chief captain himself amen listen friends amen god did this to prove to them that they wasn't going to win the battle he was going to win the battle is that right he said the reason why you got too many i don't want you going down there and fighting thinking you did it when this victory is won you're gonna know that i amen gave you the victory [Applause] hallelujah church i believe with all my heart god allows us to get in places that we absolutely have no other place to turn we have no other place to look amen there is nothing else we can depend on but i got good news when you find that god is all you have you'll also realize he is all you need hallelujah i have never one time come to a spot that i realize god you're all i got that i didn't know you're all i need [Applause] hallelujah amen it was the sword of the lord that delivered them it was a sword of the lord what did god tell israel when he gave him the land and sent him into the land he said it's not by your arm it's not by your sword it's not by your strength amen he said i gave you the land god went before them and drove out the enemies is that right amen when joshua was going over there amen to take jericho amen he met amen the captain of the lord's host amen and he had a sword in his hand is that right i was reading one commentary about it amen and he said amen he said go let the gates of hell know that the captain has already got his sword drawn hallelujah amen victory it should hallelujah we're gonna win the battle because the captain has already got his sword in his hand glory to god let me just tell you in our hour a prophet stood at sabino canyon with his hands lifted up to heaven and something struck his hand he said it fit his hand right amen amen what did the voice say don't fear it it's the word of the lord the third pull the vindication of your ministry come on church the devil come too late the sword of the lord is already here [Applause] and i think somebody ought to let the gates of hell know tonight we're getting ready to win this battle [Applause] we're getting ready to win this battle the captain has already got his sword in his hand hallelujah and our captain has never already hear me tonight he's never lost a battle not one time hallelujah amen and the captain is here with the sword in his hand glory to god well i i'm just getting through my text now so y'all gonna have to give me a little grace amen but i was telling brother ron back there a while ago i said i remember your dad so well i went up there years ago brother wayne lawson was preaching brother charlie patting one i hope this is all right he pat him on the back he said take your liberty for about one hour amen so amen i'll be mindful tonight but they were they had the enemy on the run now we come to our text tonight and gideon came to jordan passed over he and the 300 men that were with him faint that word faint means exhausted it means weary faint they were tired they were worn down they've been fighting the battle has any of you ever you ever experienced that have you ever just got tired how many they ever got weary i mean have you ever got so hey man you've been in such a battle and you've been fighting so long and you just get tired but allah i'm glad that ain't the end of it the bible didn't say amen that they were faint and that was the end of it said faint yet pursuing even though they were tired they were still going amen look even these 300 men though faint they were not faint-hearted there's a great difference in being faint and being faint-hearted if they had been cowards they'd went home and gideon said if you're fearful going back home to your family these 300 men were not cowards listen it didn't say anything about any of them wanting to quit it didn't say nothing about any of them wanting to give up they didn't say nothing about any of them even coming to the spot and you know thinking hey hey get in you need to call in the backups man we've done our part we've pushed the enemy back we've fought a hard fight we've we've exalted ourselves it's time for somebody else to take up the cause no these 300 men were determined to hold their own sword until the fight was completely over they were determined that they wasn't going to quit until they pushed every devil off of their property come on church even they are determined within themselves listen we might be tired but we ain't giving up and hey amen we may die trying amen but we're gonna aim and we're gonna fight nonetheless [Applause] amen there is no quit in them [Applause] hallelujah they have purpose in their heart we will not turn back we will not give in we will not give up [Applause] hallelujah i have a word for you so where the prophet said we have a word for us all at this time is hold fast [Music] persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of god use every weapon he's given us use every gift at our disposal look ahead with joy because we're going to be crowned by him who's our king he's the king of kings and the lord of lords do you believe that church i'm here to encourage you amen if you're tired tonight amen amen you might be faint but yet pursuant because these men were not only pursuing the enemy but brother andrew they were pursuing the will of god they were actually fulfilling their purpose amen and as doing so amen it just reminds me amen because you know i believe that no doubt the bible says they were faint even they were tired they were wore out even and when i began to read this even a few months ago i thought man the last two years has been a little bit weary i mean you know there's been a lot of pressure and it seems like every time you get a little momentum something else will hit and you get a little momentum going you know amen something else will hit amen and it'll kind of wear you down can you say amen and if you ain't careful you get a little discouraged [Applause] amen but i want to tell you we've come too far to look back we have come too far to give up church we're too close we are too close to the finish line to give in now i think about david first samuel this is real special to us because it was actually brother ron was using this as a text he was dealing with david and his wife abigail and was real special to my daughter abigail but you know david got in that spot and and he'd come in and they'd take you know the enemy had come in taken everything they'd taken their wives and their children taking out all the and and they had lost everything but you know what the bible says that david was greatly distressed and and the people actually sought to kill david david's own people wanted to stone him amen i could just hear it dave has lost his anointing yeah we we thought that god was with him but look at what's happening now we've lost every we've followed this man lost look what has cost us and they got to the place they was absolutely ready to kill david but i love the bible david amen the scripture said david encouraged himself in the lord and david amen called for the priest he said bring the ephi bring amen he said and he inquired of the lord even david didn't just listen to the people david didn't just shrink up in a corner and feel sorry for himself but david inquired of the lord and he said god shall i pursue this enemy and god said pursuit for thou without fail shall recover all [Music] hallelujah i can just hear it tonight amen david got into a spot amen i think david probably said something like this lord is there any use and can continue it is there any need for me to keep going even my own people hate me amen it don't seem like it's doing no good we've lost everything we had is there any need for us to keep and god said yeah get up david hallelujah amen what the enemy done is temporary i only allowed it to happen to show you my power hallelujah because everything you lost you're gonna get it back and my message to you is pursuit hallelujah and if you're sitting here tonight thinking is there any need of trying let me tell you absolutely hallelujah you got lost children pursue you lost your health pursue you've lost your joy pursue you lost your peace pursuit you lost your praise pursue come on church are you just going to stand there and let the devil have it i say no i feel like the three lepers sitting at the gate tonight and they begin to sit and one rose up and say why said we here that we die let's go down to the enemy's camp and take back everything that he stole from us hallelujah let's take back our hill take back our children take back your praise is your god-given right hallelujah i got a word from the lord tonight for you without fail shall recover all [Music] there ain't a devil big enough [Applause] come on church there ain't a spirit great enough amen that can stop the power of god [Applause] they even encourage himself in the lord well the man said the great charge is at hand hallelujah he said soldiers with armors gleaming's colors streaming faith and doubt is setting itself in a ray right in this tabernacle doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers he says stand at your post of duty hallelujah our captain the morning star has never he leads on see he never goes back he never don't know the word retreat hallelujah he don't know the word retreat the greatest battle has ever been false going on right here right now between life and death sickness and health faith and doubt between liberty and bondage the battle is on shine your spears come on church let me just tell you this tonight as a preacher we need you [Music] this is not a preacher's battle preachers are in the battle we're in the forefront of the fight but this ain't just a preacher's battle every believer is in this battle we need you i'm gonna say i'm not rebuking you tonight but i just i tell my church this at the trouble we guys we got too many clean swords in the church they leave them in the sheath all the time they've hung them on the mantel somewhere church if ain't blood on your sword you need to get it out sharpen it up hallelujah this ain't the time to lay down this ain't the time to give up this is a time draw your sword press the battle the enemy is real satan ain't lit up and neither have we listen we're foreseen we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight last night every sin that's so easy but say and let us run amen amen in other words probably paul is telling us listen wherever we can pass about what's so great and remember he's just went through the the great witness of the great heroes of the faith and it spoke of all the great victories that they had had and i want to ask you tonight what is going to be your excuse amen do you imagine trying to stand in front of god give your excuse why you quit i wonder how embarrassing it would be to come up before god and say well you know it just got too hard and you're standing beside paul a man who preached the gospel and they stoned him they stoned him so so badly until they laid him out outside the gate as a dead man man i wonder if you could stand and and say well you know i would have i would have kept going but it just you just don't know it got so hard and the pressure was so great and here's stan peter who was beat with stripes thrown in a prison all right with me church you know i wonder if we stand and even make a excuse of why we couldn't do it and and while we couldn't persevere and here's men like a john wycliffe and and william tyndale and men that were burned at the stake amen for the for what they knew and they didn't even have the revelation [Applause] of the full word of god that you have [Applause] think about these bunch of layout i said i i listen church i don't preach with gloves on so i hope it's all right amen but this bunch of layouts seeing cowards a bunch of five preachers we got come on church where are they going to stand on that day beside of men like paul and peter men like william branham i wonder where they would stand to stand by a man like ron spencer a bunch of 65 preachers they got all kind of reason why they can't preach the word amen they're turning around and giving up and everything here's a man that stood in a pulpit for years sick in his body but there ain't no quit in him hallelujah determine i'm going to preach this word until the last breath leaves my body hallelujah i'm glad that god still got some men that's got a backbone that's got some grit hallelujah i want the devil to know in all hell amen god still got some men that ain't got no quit in them we ain't giving up we're not turning around we're not backing down we're not laying down come on church i may die but i'll die in the faith and if i do when he calls i will rise [Music] hallelujah what excuse will we have what excuse will we have there is no excuse listen there is no reason you say brother i'm wore out praise god because i want to tell you the best thing about this whole this whole um text these men were not faint because they had been running from the enemy [Applause] come on church they were not wore out because the devil had chased them in a corner the only reason they were tired is because they had chased the enemy so far and so long hallelujah i'd rather wear it out than rust out and i'll tell you one thing brother amen if i'm weary it ain't cause i laid down somewhere it's cause i've been killing so many devils hallelujah somebody ought to let the devil know tonight devil you've thrown everything you got at me but i'm still here you didn't have enough i'm still here and i ain't going nowhere the only place i'm going is in the rapture and we are not gonna quit until every devil every enemy is defeated hallelujah and this message will be preached until our bodies are changed and we will see a resurrection because we are not of them that turn back we are of them that believe hallelujah i said hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the lord musicians come tonight let's stand our feet i'm just going to leave you with this the prophet said i got a little slogan i say it quite a bit might be good for you to take it a winner never quits and a quitter never wins and brother ben said i know a lot about that see he said but when you know you're in the will of god and you really know he said you're anchored in calvary on your he said there's nothing that can move you how there's nothing that can move you amen and i believe with all my heart tonight there ain't nothing that can move the bride of jesus christ [Music] faint yeah you'll get tired sometimes you better believe it come on church ain't no shame in admitting that you get weary sir you better believe it we're still pursuing we still got our sword in our hand we're still pressing on let's buy our heads tonight i mean just if there'd be anybody here tonight just won't lift you and say brother josh i've been a little bit wary battle's getting a little tough be encouraged tonight [Music] i was just thinking about that one get in the army got down to 300. here's an army like grasshoppers in front of them for multitude but i thought back to elisha the syrian army around him he looked over and little servant was all covered over fear and he said lord just open his eyes let him see [Music] ain't more with us than there are against us brother brown said that elisha didn't bring the angels down he only changed the scene of the servant he opened his eyes to something that was already there and i declare unto you tonight in the name of the lord this building is full of the angels of god a pillar of fires right in this building tonight jesus christ is here there's more with you than there is against him we had a prophet coming this day and declared us the unseen realm the supernatural and he he described it as something like this i got a reason for saying this he described it something like this he said a man that didn't have the sight didn't have the sense of his sight he said something could be there but he not know what it was see because he can't see it he had not the sense to declare it he said he'd bump into something and he would know that it was something there but he didn't know what it was that he was touching see because he didn't have the sin he said but somebody that had this sense of of sight could tell him what it was that he had bumped into he says just like him feeling the rays of the sun he could feel it but he couldn't declare what it was he said but somebody that could see it could say that what you're feeling is the sun shining on you and then the prophet of god said and sometimes you bump into something you feel a surge of something there's something rises up in you and you just gotta lift your hand and say hallelujah he said what it is is that's an angel there's an eighth there's angels all around you amen and i believe that some of you tonight have bumped into an angel in another place brother best said they're here to energize your faith the angels of god are riding the building tonight to energize your faith [Music] church i ain't nobody i'm nothing but i'm here to encourage you tonight don't give up we're too close we're too close to the finish line we've come too far could we just pray heavenly father lord i believe i've done my very best lord to just surrender myself and follow lord what you laid on my heart to speak tonight lord though it may be scattered out as it may be lord i pray that the holy spirit now would just come lord because i believe lord that that's what makes the difference lord we didn't come here tonight to hear a good sermon these people didn't come out in the cold night lord just to come and see one another or hear a man's get up and preach and make a fool of himself through the foolishness of preaching but lord
