[1:42] a man so I'm trying to have faith in
[1:46] that whole situation as I preach this
[1:49] sermon Jeremiah chapter 17 and verse 7
[1:56] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[2:01] Lord and whose hope the Lord is for he
[2:11] shall be as a tree planted by the waters
[2:14] and that spreaded out her roots by the
[2:17] river and shall not see when he cometh
[2:22] but her leaf shall be green and shall
[2:26] not be careful in the year of drought
[2:30] neither shall cease from yielding fruit
[2:36] Philippians chapter 4 in verse 4 a man
[2:41] Philippians chapter 4 in verse 4 rejoice

[3:43] praise think on these things
[3:49] amen let's bow our heads for prayer amen
[3:53] god bless you let's pray the Lord Jesus
[3:54] now Lord of many things even
[3:57] circumstances are going on even now I

[4:07] and sister Caitlin with us and Lord

[4:20] among us in a mighty way father these
[4:23] are your words and we now look to you
[4:25] even in brother Kelly and sister Mara's
[4:27] situation and pray that you would
[4:29] stretch forth your hand of mercy and do
[4:32] a great work we pray in Jesus Christ's
[4:35] name we ask you amen amen and amen you
[4:39] may be seated
[4:39] amen we live in an age of great pressure
[4:51] pressure is on everything pressure on
[4:54] your job pressure on your finances
[4:56] pressure your school how many of you
[4:59] young guys that are still in school
[5:01] young all the way to the age of 50 still
[5:04] in school that are that feel the
[5:08] pressure
[5:10] sometimes as a teacher you still feel
[5:13] the pressure and it even actually
[5:15] becomes a more pressure on your jobs you
[5:18] feel the pressure times of types of of
[5:21] arrangement of pressure of getting
[5:23] things done the pressures of being able
[5:27] to do the right kind of a job that it
[5:30] will pass quality control if you eat
[5:35] enough on Thanksgiving Day there will be
[5:37] pressure Niagara Falls will not have as
[5:45] much pressure at the bottom of it as
[5:49] some buttons on church
[5:52] on Friday morning the pressure of a
[5:58] scale blood pressure the pressure of a
[6:03] doctor's report there's us actually a
[6:07] term called white coat syndrome - where
[6:12] people's blood pressure goes up as they
[6:16] are walking into the doctor's office
[6:18] concerned about what the doctors going
[6:21] to say to them this is actual things
[6:26] worried causes phenomenal amounts of
[6:32] health issues where he causes cancer are
[6:41] you with me where he causes cancer where
[6:45] he causes anxiety that drives
[6:48] nervousness and and and very many
[6:52] diseases that come along with the simple
[6:55] term worry but where he is opposite from
[7:00] faith so worry does not come from God
[7:06] it's not a virtue that is in godliness
[7:10] so worry does not come from God this
[7:16] service will probably help sometimes we
[7:19] wonder where do we turn when we come to
[7:21] a roadblock in our life where do we
[7:24] escape to where do we go people build on
[7:28] tops of mountains in the middle of woods
[7:30] they build help me they build in a lot
[7:35] of different places to where that they
[7:36] just want to get away I found at that
[7:39] place where you just want to get away to
[7:42] when you get there you'll find out that
[7:44] half of America is already there maybe
[7:50] yesterday when you decided to do Black
[7:53] Friday shopping you realized after a few
[7:57] moments of arriving at Walmart
[7:59] I've never did it I'm just going to
[8:01] above it about some stories
[8:03] that you realize you're not the only one
[8:05] down maybe you got up at 3 o'clock in
[8:10] the morning to beat all the other people
[8:12] and you get there and you find out that
[8:14] there's 200 other people had the same
[8:16] idea I'm not going to get it I'm only
[8:22] going to get that piece of product am I
[8:24] going to do it whether you know it or
[8:26] not if you've done your studies and I'm
[8:28] sure all of you have but the product
[8:31] that they sell for the Black Friday is a
[8:34] lesser product that they sell two days
[8:37] before and they make that as a product
[8:41] to be so cheaper so actually what you're
[8:44] buying on Black Friday is not as good as
[8:46] what you could have bought on Thursday a
[8:49] few dollars higher a man you can always
[8:53] get lessons here not doctors you know
[8:58] because they're doctors and they're
[8:59] looking at circumstances when you walk
[9:02] into their office they all they'll try
[9:04] to treat you so they'll give you pills
[9:06] to kick you up and then they'll give you
[9:10] pills to kind of lighten your mood so
[9:12] they'll give you Downers a little bit
[9:14] they'll give you pills to kind of cause
[9:17] the anxiety to be calm before long
[9:20] you're a zombie 14 different pills
[9:24] during the day to kind of keep you on an
[9:27] even keel and then when you get the bill
[9:34] at the end of the month you really do
[9:39] have something to worry about
[9:44] whether we realize they're not this ages
[9:47] it's promised darkness in it it's
[9:50] promised darkness since it's promised a
[9:53] lot of distress it's an age to which
[9:55] that even brother Branham would say was
[9:57] not fit to live in it's actually not fit
[10:02] to live in morality has been destroyed
[10:07] marriages have been destroyed just
[10:12] common sense has been destroyed
[10:15] whether Bevin said science has come to
[10:18] its end
[10:18] civilizations coming to its end we can
[10:22] see by the sound post that the gym towel
[10:25] dispensation has came to the end of
[10:29] where Daniel said it would come to and
[10:31] it is arrived all of the government's
[10:34] are at their end there all have got
[10:36] their leaders they're all at their
[10:38] positions but so is the bride of Jesus
[10:40] Christ are you with me and if you know
[10:46] that you know that you know without a
[10:49] shadow of a doubt of who you are and
[10:51] what you've been called for and what
[10:54] your purpose is there's nothing that the
[10:57] devil can do with you
[11:07] Jesus would give us instructions let
[11:10] your light so shine before men that they
[11:13] might see your good works and glorify
[11:16] the Father which is in heaven he would
[11:21] say to us my burden is light I would
[11:24] like to just tell you tonight before we
[11:26] go into this God has already given you
[11:29] grace that's given you grace that's
[11:33] provided for your entire journey and for
[11:36] your entire roadmap and let me just give
[11:41] you a piece of advice as I go forward
[11:42] tonight keep your focus on the main
[11:45] thing all of us get tripped up when our
[11:51] focus gets off of Jesus whenever the
[11:59] first priority gets placed in in second
[12:02] place but the homer always had a rule
[12:07] for us ministers he he would tell us
[12:10] over and over again he preached it to me
[12:12] and preached me to Danny Smith and he
[12:15] preached it to Andrew here and Matthew
[12:18] and you know especially in his family he
[12:21] preached it he always said rule number
[12:23] one for a preacher it's never be alone
[12:25] with a woman other your wife and he said
[12:30] rule number two is never break rule
[12:33] number one
[12:38] and if you abide by those two rules in
[12:42] your life where it about your marriage
[12:47] is not going to be an issue Hebrews
[12:52] chapter 12 and verse 1 wherefore seeing
[12:56] we also are compassed about with so
[12:59] great a cloud of witnesses so we are not
[13:02] alone we are not alone in this in this
[13:08] battle there is somebody watching from
[13:12] another dimension that has ran just
[13:14] ahead of us are you with me now they
[13:17] didn't give up they just ran out of town
[13:22] they just ran out of time my grandfather
[13:26] was 53 years old when he ran out of time
[13:30] had a stomach condition to which that
[13:33] they actually took his stomach out and
[13:35] put a sheep stomach in to try to prolong
[13:38] his life and and these last hours of his
[13:43] life he had become a Christian in the
[13:46] last five years of his life and and I
[13:49] was born and my brother was born and we
[13:51] were we were we were just small we were
[13:53] I was four years old his last Christmas
[13:56] present to me was a blue ball I remember
[13:59] that very well and he asked the doctors
[14:05] and the nurses could he get out of the
[14:07] bed out of the hospital bed and get in
[14:09] the floor with us children he said I'd
[14:13] like for my last hours to be with them
[14:17] and so that's that's how my grandfather
[14:20] went to be with the Lord he said the
[14:24] difficulty of life or the difficulty of
[14:26] sickness it was not fighting the
[14:29] sickness it was saying goodbye and they
[14:35] would say that's probably the hardest
[14:38] most difficult thing is to say goodbye
[14:43] but there's a land of knowing that my
[14:46] last breath here my last breath here is
[14:53] my first breath there we are compassed
[14:59] about people about with a so great a
[15:02] cloud of witnesses of overcomers of
[15:05] their time and now they're encouraging
[15:08] us from that dimension are you even out
[15:13] there encouraging us listen without you
[15:18] they cannot be made perfect so somebody
[15:23] is counting on you are you with me now
[15:30] the scripture tells us to let us lay
[15:34] aside every weight let us lay aside when
[15:40] translation said lay aside every wearing
[15:42] and the sin which does so easily beset
[15:47] us rather on I'm not in sin unbelief
[15:50] it's sin and to confess confess a
[15:55] negative testimony is sinful sometimes
[16:01] we label we label our favorite sins or
[16:04] attributes of sin we label them to say
[16:08] they're bad but a negative testimony it
[16:12] is opposite of faith and God can only
[16:17] make intercession on your testimony are
[16:22] you with me tonight
[16:24] brother I don't want to live an
[16:25] overcoming life you will by your words
[16:30] the most powerful supernatural thing
[16:33] that you have is your tongue
[16:37] but the jewel for Nia's was to be here
[16:39] tonight but he as well had issues and
[16:41] couldn't come how to plumbing issues at
[16:43] his house but they remember one time he
[16:47] was here and he said the most
[16:49] supernatural thing about your entire
[16:51] body is your tongue it has the power of
[16:56] life and death inside of it it speaks
[17:01] words that that create create atmosphere
[17:05] create attitudes create praise and honor
[17:14] Valentine's Day you talk of love but
[17:17] it's more than just a Hallmark card
[17:20] we should express encouragement to our
[17:23] children to one another as we're here
[17:27] listen you never know what somebody else
[17:30] is going through set it on the seat
[17:34] beside of them you never know what they
[17:36] have went through in that day the
[17:42] scripture said looking unto Jesus
[17:45] there's no other place to look to there
[17:51] is no other place to look than look to
[17:55] Jesus sometimes we test our faith by
[18:02] looking at the spots we look into other
[18:06] spots maybe you look to Washington I can
[18:09] warn you now don't look to Washington
[18:13] they can't figure out interstate 81
[18:18] they've got all of this community upset
[18:21] by their school situations now so if
[18:25] they can't count kids they're gonna have
[18:27] a hard time teaching them algebra I'm
[18:34] sure they're doing the best that they
[18:35] can there's no perfect systems no
[18:38] perfect government's no perfect places
[18:43] to live only in Jesus
[18:52] Jesus would say in Matthew chapter 6 in
[18:54] verse 25 therefore I say unto you take
[18:59] no thought for your life what you shall
[19:06] eat or what you shall drink nor yet for
[19:10] your body what you shall put on it's not
[19:14] the life more than meat and the body
[19:18] than raiment behold the fowls of the air
[19:21] for they sow not neither do they reap
[19:24] nor gather into barns yet your heavenly
[19:29] Father feedeth them are you not much
[19:33] better than they
[19:36] which of you taking thought can add one
[19:40] cubit unto his stature let me just say
[19:43] at five foot five
[19:45] I have broke the scripture many times
[19:49] when I was a young man I always wanted
[19:52] to weigh 200 pounds I got that one and
[19:58] be six foot tall I did not get that one
[20:03] I missed that one by for my calculations
[20:08] right is seven inches
[20:09] I missed that by seven inches I'm
[20:14] worried about it short people get
[20:18] complexes don't tell me you don't but
[20:31] the random-dot dealt with complexes he
[20:35] dealt with complexes you remember it was
[20:39] even said of him that he had complexes
[20:41] about women elisha had a complex mother
[20:47] that had complexes meaning you've got
[20:49] complexes admit it or not brother
[20:52] branham was talking about Edmond way
[20:54] about his complex and it cost him such
[20:57] an issue
[20:58] till Edmond way got
[21:00] so anxious he fell dead in the pool and
[21:05] in the in the congregation and brother
[21:08] branham just standard the audience he
[21:11] steadied the audience the nurses ran
[21:14] they checked him he's gone he's gone and
[21:19] brother BAM just steps out speaks to him
[21:22] calls him by name and brings him back to
[21:27] life a man I think sometimes our critics
[21:34] ought to listen to a testimony like that
[21:44] for what take your thought for
[21:46] arraignment consider the lilies of the
[21:50] field how they grow and they told not
[21:54] neither do they spin and yet I say unto
[21:58] you that even Solomon in all his glory
[22:03] was not arrayed like one of these
[22:09] wherefore if God so clothe the grass of
[22:12] the field which said this day is and
[22:15] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[22:17] not much more clothe you all ye of
[22:20] little faith
[22:22] brethren do you mean to tell me just go
[22:25] home and sit on my couch and God will
[22:27] bring me bring it to me absolutely not
[22:30] you're not reading the same scripture
[22:33] that I'm giving you God gives you
[22:35] talents God gives you abilities God
[22:38] gives you oxygen in your lungs he told
[22:45] us to go back and to look at the ant how
[22:50] that the ant which is one of the
[22:52] smallest creatures of Earth how he works
[22:54] and is a continual worker it's kind of
[22:59] like the man that was there and you know
[23:02] the local preacher came by and the man
[23:05] was working his gardening and you know
[23:08] it is the first year for that man's
[23:10] garden and it was beautiful
[23:12] fullen everything was going well and so
[23:14] the preacher trying to figure out what
[23:17] he could say to him to kind of bring
[23:18] them to a level of spirituality and he
[23:21] says you and God is doing an incredible
[23:24] job with that garden the man looked
[23:28] across the fence and he said you ought
[23:30] to seen it last year when God had it
[23:36] some of you get it today some of you get
[23:39] it tomorrow so God uses your hands God
[23:50] uses your feet how many times they hire
[23:54] tough situations with the business and
[23:58] needed the phone to ring because if you
[24:02] don't work when you work for yourself if
[24:04] you're not working and the wheels are
[24:05] not turning you're not making money
[24:07] that's just that's the formula you
[24:10] figured out real quick if you work for
[24:11] yourself you can own 15 vans and if
[24:15] there are no wheels are not turning
[24:17] there's no money that's coming in
[24:20] because guys that that are in that
[24:23] situation they're not like the
[24:25] government they're not just writing
[24:28] checks to figure it all out
[24:31] are you with me so listen as a believer
[24:34] I begin to realize these scriptures I'm
[24:39] not worrying about tomorrow what
[24:41] tomorrow will bring
[24:43] I put it into God's hands and if God is
[24:47] my partner I better have some great big
[24:51] plans
[25:02] rather Tim Pruitt a few weeks a few
[25:05] years ago he came to our place and we've
[25:07] been buddies a long time and he came to
[25:09] our place and you know he seemed happy
[25:11] in his church and and some things and
[25:13] I'm not gonna tell you the whole story
[25:14] because I'd take till next week sometime
[25:16] but anyway he came to my place and he
[25:19] was showing us they bought about 38
[25:22] acres of land and they paid for that now
[25:25] they're going to build a they're gonna
[25:26] be able to church on it I don't know
[25:28] where the money's gonna come from but
[25:30] God God's told me to build the church he
[25:34] built a phenomenal answer there he built
[25:41] a phenomenal a phenomenal church couple
[25:49] million dollars I would say building and
[25:53] when he finished it it was 100 percent
[25:57] paid for
[25:59] [Applause]
[26:14] he's just built a fellowship hall I
[26:18] think it's a hundred foot wide 100 foot
[26:20] long by a 150 foot long by by 65 foot
[26:24] long it's not finished but it's paid for
[26:31] when it came to the parking lot it was
[26:36] paid for and I reminded him men his
[26:40] friend all through all to the journey I
[26:42] said if God is your partner and here's
[26:48] the way that I look at this God wanted
[26:50] to build him there he wanted to build in
[26:56] there he wanted a building here he
[27:01] wanted a building here we're preparing
[27:09] to work on a fellowship hall here and
[27:13] funds will be allocated for that to take
[27:16] place
[27:17] don't worry that might gonna be the text
[27:20] to you tonight you builders don't worry
[27:29] how you gonna do it brother run he told
[27:33] me to so we're gonna build it the way we
[27:37] did our house didn't we brother Terry we
[27:39] built our house and he told me exactly
[27:41] how to lay it out and we built that
[27:43] house and brother Kent walked in last
[27:45] night and eyes wide open a grin from ear
[27:48] to ear I like to see that you see if God
[27:55] is your partner take worry and put it in
[28:00] a mailbox and send it away
[28:03] I borrow another statement that said
[28:08] write all your whereís down and when
[28:13] you're done writing all your worries
[28:15] down throw them in the trash can
[28:20] Psalms 23 says this in verse 1 and
[28:23] you're familiar to you but I want to
[28:24] remind you again the Lord is my shepherd
[28:28] I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[28:34] down in green pastures and he leads me
[28:37] beside of the still waters so who is
[28:40] steering a Christian who is the captain
[28:48] of the boat or the captain II or so the
[28:50] very god to you it's him he restoreth my
[28:56] soul he leadeth me in the paths of
[28:58] righteousness for his name's sake
[29:00] and yea though I walk through the valley
[29:02] of the shadow of death here comes that
[29:07] word that has said six hundred times in
[29:09] the scripture fear I will fear no evil
[29:12] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[29:16] staff they comfort me and thou prepares
[29:18] the table before me in the presence of
[29:20] mine enemies thou anointest my head with
[29:22] all in my cup runneth over
[29:24] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[29:26] me all the days of my life are you with
[29:31] me stay with me and I will dwell in the
[29:33] house of the Lord forever
[29:44] now let me just say that seems like it
[29:47] seems like simple you've quartered it
[29:49] since a child but if you will follow
[29:52] those scriptures and stay in the house
[29:54] of the Lord raise your children
[29:58] appropriately good things will happen in
[30:01] your household and let me just say
[30:05] though your children might look like
[30:07] they've gone a million miles away and
[30:10] there's no hope for them never give up
[30:14] never give up never give up put them in
[30:18] the hands of Jesus Christ who better to
[30:21] put your children in in the hands of
[30:24] Jesus Christ God came and met Jobe and
[30:35] you know the story Jobe is written in
[30:37] the scriptures for our admonition and
[30:39] for a measuring stick for all of our
[30:41] problems and none of us have had a
[30:43] problems like Jobe had none none and the
[30:49] Lord answered job out of a world one
[30:52] chapter 38 in 1 out of a whirlwind and
[30:55] said who is this that darkeneth counsel
[30:58] by words without knowledge where are you
[31:04] getting your counsel from look at now
[31:08] thy loins like a man for I demand of
[31:10] thee and answer thee me where was God
[31:15] when I laid the foundations of the earth
[31:20] declare if thou has understanding who
[31:24] hath laid the measures there ever thou
[31:27] knowest or who has stretching the line
[31:28] upon it where upon the foundations there
[31:31] are fastened or who laid the cornerstone
[31:34] thereof when the morning stars sang
[31:38] together and all the sons of God shouted
[31:43] for joy
[31:45] where is all of us the sons of god gonna
[31:47] shop for joy at the end so God is having
[31:54] a meeting with joked and he doesn't talk
[31:57] to him out about his children he doesn't
[32:02] talk to him about the pity party that
[32:04] he's in he doesn't talk to anybody's
[32:07] wife he doesn't talk to him about the
[32:09] men that are making accusations doing oh
[32:12] brother on I wish God would come and
[32:15] talk to me he would not talk to you
[32:17] about your problems we have an example
[32:23] here he won't talk to you about your
[32:25] problems he'll talk to you about what is
[32:28] eternal and the great thing about when
[32:31] God comes to talk to you that you're in
[32:34] his plans
[32:36] [Music]
[32:46] that's quite an incredible thing
[32:49] that's quite an incredible thing to be
[32:53] in his plans what more could be said
[33:01] right there so when this world is remade
[33:06] and it becomes fire all over because
[33:10] that's what God's going to do with it
[33:12] it's going to burn all the trash off of
[33:14] it it's going to burn everything that
[33:16] there is and it's going to become dust
[33:18] and he's going to remake the earth like
[33:20] he had to do you you had to do you the
[33:24] same thing had to burn all that stuff on
[33:26] the out of out of you and recreates you
[33:31] because you couldn't live with yourself
[33:35] you had tempers they fight about saw you
[33:38] had a mouth that would make us a navies
[33:40] axial Navy SEAL actually embarrassed to
[33:43] be around you your thoughts ran in every
[33:47] kind of chaotic direction and you really
[33:51] didn't have a plan for your life
[33:52] but God rich in mercy told you that you
[33:57] came from God and you're going back to
[33:59] God and he picked you up when you wasn't
[34:04] looking for God he picked you up and he
[34:08] shook you from your condition and some
[34:15] of you've got some books I'm going to
[34:16] preach in a week or so maybe tomorrow on
[34:19] the two books you had an old book and
[34:23] God had to rewrite that old book because
[34:26] there was a lot of stinking chapters on
[34:28] the inside of that old book and God had
[34:31] to rewrite it and remake it
[34:34] [Applause]
[34:46] Jesus would say it like this come unto
[34:49] me all ye that are heavy laden unto me
[34:53] all ye that labor and are heavy-laden I
[34:55] will give you rest and that's Matthew 11
[34:56] verse 28 take my yoke upon you and learn
[35:00] of me for I am meek and lowly in heart
[35:03] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[35:06] my yoke is easy my burden is light I've
[35:12] never had a hangover throwing my guts up
[35:20] from being in a service I've never left
[35:26] this building and wake up tomorrow
[35:28] morning not knowing where I'm at now in
[35:42] the world when you gave the world money

[35:55] bottom of a bottle that bottle will
[35:57] destroy homes lives and bodies
[36:09] and feta means and drugs and all kind of
[36:14] nonsense that people put in their body

[36:18] minutes or maybe overnight that will
[36:21] last people will go through all
[36:26] different kinds of websites to figure
[36:28] out if the doctor gives them the right
[36:30] medicine that won't have interactions

[38:26] your ears and tell you how good those
[38:32] old times was you can be a Christian for
[38:36] 40 years and be in a restaurant and all
[38:38] of a sudden I like that old time rock

[38:59] meal are you with me and a girl walked
[39:04] across him but the Peregrine watched

[39:35] only one came to this earth people go
[39:47] all nuts about brother Branham and they
[39:48] point out all of his mistakes won't you
[39:51] just turn the microscope around a little
[39:52] bit have you read all of this brother on
[39:58] no because I don't want to read all that
[40:01] nonsense because I know the people
[40:04] that's writing it the kid their kids
[40:08] turn out gay they become atheist almost
[40:11] overnight you see I knew those people
[40:16] when they were still professing the
[40:18] message and they were all the actors
[40:21] then that I kept telling other preachers
[40:24] those people don't have the Holy Ghost
[40:26] and
[40:27] don't deserve to be in a pulpit but now
[40:30] they got snapchat or whatever chats that
[40:32] they got don't worry with them you say
[40:45] we're brother on why are you that
[40:46] there's two people here tonight needed
[40:48] to hear that and if they keep telling
[40:52] you you need to read that kind of
[40:54] nonsense you just tell them to take that
[40:56] back to hell where it came from
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:19] do you get brad letters brother on
[41:22] Monday generally is the bad letter day
[41:29] so since I got a bad letter I give them
[41:31] a bad letter and most of those letters
[41:34] consist of this because you are an idiot
[41:42] god bless you because you are an idiot
[41:45] and decided to waste your day on about
[41:50] telling me what to do don't waste your
[41:55] time on me no more you're asking me to
[42:06] practice what I'm preaching so don't
[42:09] worry with them so you called it like
[42:12] you see it because you're an idiot if
[42:20] you're watching tonight brother Tim
[42:21] that's your favorite word proverbs 12
[42:29] and verse 25 anxiety in a man's heart
[42:33] weighs him down what a good word makes
[42:37] him glad that was a translation first
[42:43] Peter chapter 5 and verse 7 cast all
[42:45] your cares on him because he cares for
[42:51] you now this is going to give the devil
[42:55] some heartburn you had to suffer from
[42:57] heartburn last night this is going this
[42:59] next a little bit it's going to give the
[43:00] devil some heartburn so hang right with
[43:02] me ye are of God little children and
[43:06] have overcome them because greater is He
[43:08] that is in you than he that is in the
[43:11] world Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6
[43:16] being confident of this very thing that
[43:18] he which
[43:20] have begun a good work in you will
[43:23] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[43:30] God is not the kind of businessman that
[43:33] starts a project and then just throws
[43:35] you away so how many of you in this
[43:39] building believe that you definitely are
[43:42] not at you're in but God has started a
[43:44] work in you maybe this mic is not
[43:51] working you're not at you're in because
[43:56] you're not in the next dimension so how
[43:59] many of you in this building actually
[44:01] believe that God has begun a work in you
[44:08] so I'm reading you what God said about
[44:11] your hand being in the air I began a
[44:14] good work on you and I will perform it
[44:28] romans chapter 8 in verse 28 and we know
[44:31] that all things work together for the
[44:33] good to them that love God how many
[44:34] lovers of God do we have to them who are
[44:37] the called according to his purpose for
[44:41] whom he did foreknow he also did
[44:43] predestinate to be conformed to the
[44:45] image of his son that he might be the
[44:47] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[44:49] whom he did predestinate them he also
[44:51] called and whom he called them he also
[44:52] justified and whom he justified them he
[44:55] also glorified
[44:56] what shall we then say to these things
[44:58] if God be for us
[45:01] say this with me if God be for us who
[45:13] who can be against us well Ron I've had
[45:21] trouble with so-and-so well I'll give
[45:23] you some instructions just only a couple
[45:25] of minutes ago I may not work in your

[45:37] scripture that will help if God be for
[45:40] me now I really like this part

[46:51] I'm sure that's great he that spared not
[47:02] his own son but delivered him up for us
[47:05] how shall he not with him freely give us
[47:09] all things who shall lay anything to the
[47:13] charge of God's elect it is God that
[47:17] justified now under the Seventh Seal we
[47:22] understood what justification is it's as

[47:49] things you've thought things you've
[47:53] looked to things you've done you've done
[47:54] acted you've had the wrong attitude I
[47:56] think I'm getting to the right spot here

[48:02] wrong attitude how many wakes up with
[48:05] the wrong attitude boy I'm preaching to

[48:35] fight a bustle what happened to the
[48:40] rapture condition just before you went
[48:42] to bed I'm preaching the right group now
[48:57] who is it the condemneth it is Christ
[49:01] that died gay rather that is risen again
[49:03] even at the right hand of God who maketh
[49:05] intercession for us who shall separate
[49:08] us from the love of Christ shall
[49:11] tribulation or distress are persecuted
[49:15] this is a list now persecution famine
[49:19] nakedness pearl or sword as it is
[49:23] written for thy sake we are killed all
[49:24] the day long and counted as sheep for
[49:26] the slaughter
[49:26] nay and all these things we're more than
[49:29] conquerors through him that loved us for
[49:34] I am persuaded remember where Paul's
[49:37] writing this from from a dungeon for I
[49:40] am persuaded that neither death nor life
[49:42] nor Angels nor principalities nor powers
[49:44] nor things present or things to come nor
[49:46] height nor depth any other creature
[49:48] shall be able to separate us from the
[49:50] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[49:52] Lord
[49:58] resurrection of Jesus brother Brent says
[50:00] this he said if you will just notice
[50:03] it's when you're discouraged that's when
[50:05] the devil can really pour it on you and
[50:09] he said that's when he gets you if you

[52:29] fingernail

[52:46] walking his life knowing that you're
[52:48] walking with him nothing can harm you
[52:59] there's nothing can harm you there's me
[53:02] the powers there thinks president or
[53:04] things future nothing can separate us
[53:06] from the love we're in him and we never

[53:19] notice not we by choice he by choice
[53:24] elected us and brought us in to him well
[53:29] I wish I could just write this down put
[53:31] it on your refrigerator for you to
[53:32] listen at it and over and over again
[53:36] well the man says God's given every sick
[53:41] person in here divine healing every one
[53:45] of you
[53:46] Jesus was wounded for our transgressions
[53:49] and with these stripes we were healed
[53:51] it's yours but you have to fight for
[53:54] every inch that you possess are you with
[53:58] me are you with me you'll have to fight
[54:01] for it Joshua I've given you click
[54:12] Prince means possessions let's go in
[54:15] footprints
[54:16] it's possession let's take every inch of
[54:18] ground that God give us and if you
[54:21] haven't got the baptism of the Holy
[54:22] Ghost Peter said the promise is unto you
[54:24] and you your children and to him as afar
[54:27] off even as many as the Lord our God
[54:28] shall call footprints this possession

[54:44] it's God's promise don't look at the
[54:47] circumstances don't look at how hard it
[54:50] is less possess it
[54:58] Joshua fought for every inch of ground
[55:00] from one one part one end of the country
[55:03] to the other but he had a promise he
[55:09] said God said I'll give it to you
[55:12] whether there's Giants whether there's
[55:16] atheists where there's infidels where
[55:19] there's cold formal churches what
[55:21] difference does it make
[55:23] God give us the promise let's take it
[55:28] let me just say this is I never ever
[55:31] worried about the rapture I never
[55:36] worried about the resurrection because
[55:39] I'm in the rapture
[55:41] it can't happen without me
[55:52] I'm not worried about the resurrection
[55:58] because the resurrection is in me are
[56:03] you with me and if it's in me if God
[56:06] takes me by the way of the grade I never
[56:08] think the thought hold mine just worried
[56:11] about death death is only a tool in the
[56:14] hand of God in my life
[56:18] I could write a book on what you can
[56:20] live through are you with me
[56:27] how will you die brother run I've lived
[56:29] through a lot of things but if he takes
[56:34] me while I'm sitting in the chair like
[56:36] brother ghido and I just slip away it's
[56:40] taken care of Billy Graham said don't
[56:43] you cry for me don't weep a kill
[56:48] it's everything that I've wanted Charles
[56:53] Spurgeon said it's the greatest thing
[56:55] for a Christian as they get near the
[56:58] last hours of their life that new body
[57:01] is coming to take you home
[57:07] listen God's never in a crisis God's
[57:09] never worried he's never tore up the
[57:11] Bowery with me now how is it going to be
[57:17] at my end let me just say it's in the
[57:19] hands of God it don't matter I got my
[57:24] hands in the hands of the man that can
[57:26] steal the water if God might have
[57:31] promised and God gave a promise and you
[57:32] believe it I don't care what takes place
[57:34] it's yours if God made a promise and God
[57:38] gave a promise and you believe it I
[57:40] don't care what takes place it's yours
[57:46] are you getting this now if God made a
[57:49] promise and God gave the promise and you
[57:50] believe that and I don't care what it
[57:52] takes place it's yours
[57:57] fight the devil on every ounce of ground
[58:01] that he stands on walk over take it take
[58:04] the sword of the word God's promises is
[58:06] true nothing can stop them they're God's
[58:11] promises he gave us the promise of that
[58:14] just like he did the children of Israel
[58:18] he's the same yesterday today and Thor I
[58:27] love this one
[58:29] if the enemy smites on one side of the
[58:32] cheek let's remember what he did before
[58:36] we smart back let's remember his action
[58:41] if there is a decision to be made
[58:44] let's wait remember what kind of
[58:47] decision we make we think he would make
[58:52] then let that be our decision this is
[58:57] brother brems words he said if we get
[59:00] hasty let's remember he never was in a
[59:05] hurry if we get over anxious remember he
[59:15] dwells in eternity and time means
[59:20] nothing
[59:26] the man that was standing there - the
[59:28] preacher that was standing there in the
[59:30] foxes Book of Martyrs and he handed the
[59:34] priests his watch his timepiece he said
[59:41] will you hold this for me and he said
[59:44] well that's a strange request he said
[59:46] I'm not going to need it where I'm going
[59:51] [Laughter]
[59:59] Jesus was three days late and it was
[1:00:02] right on time
[1:00:05] and you may think he's been late to your
[1:00:10] case over and over and over again but I
[1:00:14] have been proclaiming the promise and I
[1:00:16] proclaim performance and I proclaimed
[1:00:18] the promise don't get too hasty God's
[1:00:21] always on time
[1:00:34] brother Graham said don't get ahead of
[1:00:36] God because he's the one that's leading
[1:00:41] you what a powerful statement sometimes
[1:00:46] we get wore out thinking God has
[1:00:48] forgotten and God doesn't care and God
[1:00:52] doesn't love us and made us a promise
[1:00:54] but here we are 25 years old older than
[1:00:58] we was when he made the promise and it's
[1:01:01] impossible now for us to have children
[1:01:08] why are we having children well first of
[1:01:13] all me and you can't produce nothing but
[1:01:18] trouble but if God comes on the scene
[1:01:26] now I've got something to back that up
[1:01:30] Abraham produce trouble because Abraham
[1:01:36] got in a hurry how many in this building
[1:01:39] tonight could confess I had some to
[1:01:42] confess about worry hemming in this
[1:01:44] building getting too big a hurry
[1:01:54] getting hurt getting hurt you know well
[1:01:59] your former pastor you take on the
[1:02:01] spirit of your pastor and so this would
[1:02:05] be one of his weaknesses and so I
[1:02:07] mentioned it too you don't have this
[1:02:08] weakness no more but remember the trip
[1:02:12] to Arizona we went to Arizona all of us
[1:02:15] a family went to narrow zone and we went
[1:02:17] to Arizona we went to the we went to the
[1:02:20] Grand Canyon we drove all day to see the
[1:02:23] Grand Canyon all day all day we drove
[1:02:27] across Arizona to see the Grand Canyon
[1:02:28] when we got there brother Thomas and I
[1:02:31] was looking over the you know I was
