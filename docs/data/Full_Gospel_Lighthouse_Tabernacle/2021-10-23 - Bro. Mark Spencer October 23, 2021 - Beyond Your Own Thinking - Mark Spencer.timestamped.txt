[37:06] that finite you're looking at the

[43:25] witnesses
[43:27] let us lay aside every weight in the sin
[43:29] that so easily beset us and let us run
[43:31] this patient run run with patience the
[43:34] race that is set before us
[43:36] looking unto jesus the author and the
[43:39] finish of our faith
[43:41] who for the joy
[43:43] that was set before him
[43:45] endured the cross despising the shame
[43:48] and is set down at the right hand of of
[43:50] the throne of god
[43:52] for consider him that endured such
[43:55] contradiction of sinners against himself
[43:58] lest he you be worried and faint in your
[44:00] own minds
[44:02] you have not yet
[44:04] resisted unto the blood striving against
[44:06] sin
[44:07] and ye have and ye have forgotten
[44:11] the exhortation which speaketh unto you
[44:14] as unto children my son despise not thou
[44:17] the chastening of the lord nor faint
[44:19] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[44:22] the lord loveth he chasteneth
[44:25] and scourgeth every son whom he
[44:28] receiveth
[44:30] verse 7
[44:32] if ye endure chastening
[44:34] god dealeth with you
[44:36] as with sons
[44:37] for what son
[44:39] is he whom the father chasteneth not
[44:43] may the lord add his blessings to his
[44:45] word deceiving you may be seated amen we
[44:47] we see thee we see when we read these
[44:49] scriptures and we see wherefore we're
[44:51] being compassed about with such a
[44:53] greater cloud of witnesses these are
[44:55] these are people that's going on this is
[44:57] the bride of jesus christ that have went
[44:59] on to meet the reward you've seen them
[45:01] thus you've seen them walk with you and
[45:03] talk with you and now they have stepped
[45:05] into their beyond they're stepped on
[45:07] into their eternal home but they are
[45:09] such a cloud of witnesses that's around
[45:11] us amen and we look at this and we see
[45:13] that but the one i want to take picture
[45:15] to the night i want you to look at the
[45:17] lord jesus christ tonight amen he
[45:19] endured so much and he did what he
[45:21] needed to do he did what he was called
[45:23] to do amen he found himself in the
[45:26] scriptures he knew what he was come to
[45:27] the earth to do and it was to save
[45:29] people like you and me amen because we
[45:31] were all full of sin we were all full of
[45:34] doubt and fear and envy and strife and
[45:36] you know the world is going through it
[45:37] today they're looking for an answer
[45:39] they're looking for something they're
[45:41] they're looking for something there's
[45:42] even people that's on the internet right
[45:44] now that are looking to try to find
[45:45] peace just by looking if i can see the
[45:48] services i can see god still moving but
[45:50] they will not relieve themselves to come
[45:52] to god they will not you've got to tear
[45:54] down this being right here you've got to
[45:56] tear it down amen i heard it said the
[45:58] other day the only person likes to
[46:00] change is a baby
[46:01] you change it it starts crying you
[46:04] change it you either feed it or you you
[46:06] you change it diaper i'm sorry i'm just
[46:08] being honest but you look at it that's
[46:09] exactly the way the world is tonight
[46:11] they are full of sin but they won't cry
[46:14] out to god they won't look for the
[46:16] answer and jesus christ is the answer
[46:18] and he died for us he arose for us he
[46:20] went to hell for us amen he went down he
[46:23] endured that he knew what was coming up
[46:25] he knew it when he talked to him right
[46:27] there on moses when elijah was talking
[46:29] to him they explained to him the things
[46:31] he was getting ready to happen they were
[46:32] giving him encouragement you're getting
[46:34] ready to go some of the tests of your
[46:36] life they're giving him the
[46:37] encouragement you've got to stand tall
[46:39] that's exactly what's going on tonight
[46:41] there's those who are standing up
[46:42] they're praying for you brother brother
[46:44] tim pruitt talking about it he said
[46:46] they're praying for you that you will
[46:48] not give it up in the end that you will
[46:49] not sell yourself out for something of
[46:51] the world is going on the world is
[46:52] getting so full that it just it looks at
[46:55] sin it's not even sin anymore it becomes
[46:58] this is normal you know i'm here to tell
[47:00] you sin is sin and when you look at it
[47:02] in the bible right here if it's wrong in
[47:04] the bible he did not change his mind
[47:06] about his word amen i told a couple
[47:08] today and they was walking in up here
[47:09] and probably the guy kind of looked at
[47:11] me kind of funny but i said it is good
[47:12] to see ladies in a dress
[47:15] it's good to see ladies in the dress
[47:17] and they kind of looked at him and i
[47:18] said well it's better to be in that than
[47:20] be naked or to be you know and he kind
[47:22] of looked at me i was like well he's
[47:23] gonna punch me but you know they might
[47:24] as well be naked the way they're walking
[47:26] around in this world they become so
[47:27] immune to sin they can walk around naked
[47:30] and not know it amen that's the layout
[47:32] of sin age that we're living in we're
[47:35] living in an age that sin is so
[47:36] predominant that it becomes wrong to be
[47:39] right
[47:40] it becomes wrong to be right i'm hoping
[47:42] this is okay to preach but i'm telling
[47:43] you sometimes we get caught up in it but
[47:45] when you say something you're going to
[47:47] endure some chastisement you're going to
[47:49] endure some words that you're not ready
[47:50] for and you better be ready to stand
[47:52] upon the word of god amen to have an
[47:54] anchor that holds amen the gates of hell
[47:57] shall not prevail against that rock that
[47:59] rock being jesus christ i looked at that
[48:01] and i said you know the chastening
[48:03] that's going on we're lightly doing it
[48:05] right here we're lightly doing it in
[48:07] america we sit here and we go well you
[48:09] know i got to go to church it's saturday
[48:11] night again it's sunday morning does he

[48:17] that i i we're we're dedicated to giving
[48:19] money and to get it over into the
[48:20] mission fields and i know you all are
[48:22] too and you you send your pastor they're
[48:24] going to see people that are hungry
[48:26] there are words searching for every word
[48:28] of god they're searching for more hymn
[48:31] and they're looking at it and they can
[48:32] be you know like like italy and all
[48:34] these and brother king george's he's got
[48:37] he's there in ireland he got got all
[48:39] those people that are there that are
[48:40] catholics but he is a shining star there
[48:43] amongst them and man we're four years to
[48:45] come past come passed about with such a
[48:47] great a cloud of witnesses amen those
[48:49] those witnesses and that light is
[48:50] shining down upon them he's looking and
[48:53] he is shining forth his family they
[48:55] meant to be a lighthouse for jesus
[48:57] christ and this end time message i thank
[48:59] god for the end time message how many of
[49:01] you thank god for the end time message
[49:02] amen i give him glory
[49:05] amen we have not had the we had not had
[49:08] the end time message of the hour i look
[49:10] at it i see people walking away from the
[49:12] message of what's going on in this day
[49:14] and how it's explained how abraham
[49:16] become young again we're going to get
[49:17] into him in just an hour or two but i
[49:19] look at it we see how the he became i
[49:21] like that amen y'all listening amen
[49:28] [Music]
[49:30] you look at it
[49:31] you know if it had not been
[49:34] if it had not been
[49:36] for the prophet of god
[49:38] coming in our time in our hour
[49:42] and delivering a message that came from
[49:44] god it didn't come from some man's creed
[49:47] some man's dogma he even goes back and
[49:49] explains it he said i was wrong when i
[49:51] read that book i was wrong how they
[49:53] interpreted but i looked at it and god
[49:56] gave me the interpretation of it the
[49:58] revelation of the hour comes only from
[50:00] jesus christ amen you can either be led
[50:03] by the light or blinded by the light
[50:05] amen and i look at that and i see god
[50:07] moving by his spirit down upon him and
[50:09] he moved through the word of god through
[50:11] brother branham and he delivered a
[50:13] message that we can understand yep
[50:16] abraham was turned young again sarah was
[50:18] turned young again we see that through
[50:20] the message of the hour if you read it
[50:22] you would not know that if you read it
[50:25] you just said well you know people say
[50:26] well they got the bible so mixed up in
[50:28] its time and that some chapters came
[50:30] after this chapter and all that they're
[50:32] looking for a simple man-made reason but
[50:34] they can't see god changing a person

[50:39] than this shall ye do ye do i'm a part
[50:42] of that ye in there amen write your name

[52:45] and i see jesus christ what did he do
[52:47] for you i mean he he did everything for
[52:50] you he did everything and i want to take
[52:52] a look in the scriptures this evening
[52:53] hey man i'm not like ronaldine i can't
[52:55] take a pause it's like if i take a pause
[52:57] i forget what i was thinking about a
[52:58] while ago but he is perfect at that
[53:01] ain't he i know he's out there going my
[53:03] lord but he can take a pause
[53:05] and it's like i'm waiting on the next
[53:06] word
[53:08] give me the next word amen that's what
[53:10] we should be doing is anticipating the
[53:13] very next word from jesus christ that
[53:16] word comes down it's alive and it's well
[53:19] it gives you that strength that says i
[53:20] need that right now i need that because
[53:22] many times we feel like we're all alone
[53:24] amen we feel like we're all alone the
[53:26] devil wants to depress a christian he's
[53:28] got every eye on you and he's going i
[53:31] want you to go get her i want you to go
[53:33] get him i want you today i want you to
[53:35] make him so bad i want you to make him
[53:37] say something i don't know if y'all ever
[53:38] did that amen but you look at you think
[53:41] things say man you think things say you
[53:43] know i'm sorry you know as i said the
[53:45] other night i said just because you
[53:46] think things don't mean you've just been
[53:48] completely black see you backslid
[53:50] blacksmith but you look at you see you
[53:53] all you got to do is ask god to forgive
[53:55] you that's the kind of god he said i
[53:56] know he would repent
[53:58] he knew job wouldn't do what he he knew
[54:00] job he knew what he was doing have you
[54:02] considered my servant job i look at you
[54:04] have a modern day job right here he
[54:07] don't he don't like to be called out he
[54:08] said i don't want to go through what job

[54:33] wouldn't know anything's wrong with him
[54:35] at all amen because there's something on
[54:37] the inside says this little bit of pain
[54:39] that i'm suffering here is nothing when
[54:42] it's compared to the eternity of living
[54:44] with jesus christ compared to eternity i
[54:46] ain't letting nothing turn me around i
[54:48] want to continue to press forward
[54:50] pressing forward doesn't mean well he's
[54:52] bigger than i am amen it's like david
[54:55] continue to wing it around amen i may
[54:58] miss one time but i'm going to get you
[54:59] the next time amen but if god's on earth
[55:02] god's going to provide his way amen

[55:12] heard that well you're going to hear it

[58:31] we're coming down to the nuts and bolts
[58:33] of what the bride of jesus christ is
[58:35] we're coming down to the time when
[58:36] there's going to come a time when you
[58:38] don't have a lot of friends sitting
[58:39] around hey man jesus went to that cross
[58:42] he went to that cross and he looked down
[58:44] and he seen all those people that he fed
[58:45] and he took care of healed their sick
[58:47] and raised them from the dead what were
[58:49] they doing at the end they were spitting
[58:51] at him and they were doing all this
[58:52] stuff and even his inside disciples that
[58:54] was there with him walked away they
[58:56] wouldn't even want to be seen with him
[58:58] amen and that's the same thing it's
[58:59] coming to this day it's almost a sin to
[59:02] be a christian anymore amen

[59:37] he knew me and he seen me and what i
[59:40] needed and man if it's one or many sins
[59:42] he knew what i needed
[59:44] he knew that he would be with me these
[59:46] these soldiers are sitting over here i
[59:48] watched them on the thing and they're
[59:49] there they are dancing what is it they
[59:51] got something way back then that's still
[59:52] real now hey man we still stand here

[59:56] come back and get some more what is that
[59:58] going on it's something that you got

[1:00:17] psalms 143 and 10 teach me to do thy
[1:00:20] will
[1:00:20] for thou art my god
[1:00:23] thy spirit is good
[1:00:25] lead me into the land of uprighteousness
[1:00:29] many people don't want to give up
[1:00:31] themselves if david back in that day
[1:00:34] he knew what god was he knew that god
[1:00:37] was with him when he was in the battles
[1:00:39] he knew that god would walk with him
[1:00:40] down through the trials of this life
[1:00:42] amen in the uprighteousness amen and
[1:00:44] that's where we are tonight if you're
[1:00:46] not get on an altar amen but the
[1:00:48] uprighteousness of living in this day
[1:00:50] people know there's a difference when
[1:00:51] you walk into walmart and man they know
[1:00:53] there's a difference when you walk into
[1:00:54] the grocery store they know there's
[1:00:56] something different about you because
[1:00:58] why you are god's called there's a light
[1:01:00] that shines amongst you hey man i heard
[1:01:02] brother brother ron talking about he
[1:01:03] said and what a great meeting they had
[1:01:05] down there amen and just letting god
[1:01:07] move and then y'all had a great meeting
[1:01:09] up here i was like lord the mercy of one
[1:01:10] sunday we just had church all day long i
[1:01:12] was like wow i said this is all right
[1:01:15] you know you look at you see god moving
[1:01:17] what is it one day we're going to be in
[1:01:18] that eternally one day we're going to be
[1:01:20] there but right now he gives us just a
[1:01:22] taste of it mean this mortal body
[1:01:24] couldn't handle that kind of pressure
[1:01:25] all the time i mean he couldn't handle
[1:01:27] it because it would just explode amen
[1:01:29] but i'm looking at it this is what we
[1:01:30] want to do is get closer to god amen let
[1:01:33] god move by his spirit down upon us and
[1:01:35] he says leading me into the
[1:01:37] uprighteousness amen and that's where
[1:01:38] we're going we're going forward we're
[1:01:40] pressing forward to the mark of the high
[1:01:42] calling acts 2 38 repent and be baptized
[1:01:46] amen
[1:01:48] repent and be baptized amen not just in
[1:01:51] any name
[1:01:52] but in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:01:54] what for the remission of your sin that
[1:01:56] means they're taking them all the way
[1:01:58] back you know you hear about it well
[1:01:59] they are in remission of cancer never in
[1:02:01] remission of tuberculosis or remission
[1:02:03] of this what's the remission of sins
[1:02:05] it's more important than a sickness
[1:02:07] temporal here if you can get somebody
[1:02:09] saved sanctified holy ghost filled and
[1:02:11] baptized amen they have an eternal home
[1:02:13] awaiting amen you say well the devil
[1:02:15] made me do it glad you asked amen the
[1:02:17] devil makes me do these things well i
[1:02:19] can tell you what you went to the line
[1:02:22] you went to the line
[1:02:24] he didn't come across the line because
[1:02:25] i'm here to tell you the bloodline of
[1:02:27] jesus christ is what separates a sinner
[1:02:29] from a saint amen and you look at you
[1:02:31] see if he was to come across that
[1:02:33] bloodline he'd have to be saved
[1:02:35] sanctified holy ghost filled and
[1:02:37] baptized then he'd be your brother
[1:02:40] amen i can say that because brother
[1:02:42] branham said dad
[1:02:44] brother brown said that he said that's
[1:02:45] the only way that the devil can come
[1:02:47] across that bloodline is to come the
[1:02:49] same way a sinner did amen i thank god
[1:02:52] that there's a bloodline tonight i thank
[1:02:53] god that blood will never ever ever lose
[1:02:56] its power that's god himself living in
[1:02:59] there amen covering those multitude of
[1:03:01] sin hey man i looked at it i had to
[1:03:04] i went out on the porches there i went
[1:03:06] there and i put down this this this
[1:03:09] paint
[1:03:10] they said it will last forever
[1:03:17] spiritually speaking there's a lot of
[1:03:18] churches out there
[1:03:20] this will last forever
[1:03:23] this will last forever you just send in
[1:03:25] your tithe and your offering
[1:03:27] help us with their bake sales
[1:03:31] everybody has their ideas about those
[1:03:34] but then we'll get you to heaven
[1:03:38] i put down that paint
[1:03:40] oh
[1:03:40] it's nice
[1:03:42] non-skid good
[1:03:45] i walked around on it we did it for oh
[1:03:48] it was
[1:03:49] it's been on there three or four or five
[1:03:51] years they said 25 years and it wouldn't
[1:03:53] be a problem i said all right
[1:03:57] but i got sold something that wasn't
[1:03:58] right
[1:04:00] because the other day i put it under
[1:04:01] pressure
[1:04:03] put it under pressure i don't know if
[1:04:05] y'all have birds up here we got birds
[1:04:06] down there
[1:04:08] and they like that porch
[1:04:11] there's a power line sits right across
[1:04:12] the top of it
[1:04:17] so i took my i took my time down there i
[1:04:19] said well i cleaned the church
[1:04:22] so i said well i'm going to clean off
[1:04:23] all that gunk off of there
[1:04:25] i'd say gunk okay so i started spraying
[1:04:28] it off
[1:04:29] i said that thing's gonna last
[1:04:31] and all of a sudden
[1:04:33] brother randy
[1:04:35] about half a sheet of that stuff
[1:04:38] that wasn't nothing but neck and board
[1:04:40] laying there
[1:04:41] i'm like i knocked that stain all the
[1:04:43] way back down to where that thing was
[1:04:44] growing as a tree
[1:04:46] you know that's exactly what happens to
[1:04:48] a lot of people's religion that they
[1:04:50] have
[1:04:52] they have enough to get them to church
[1:04:54] but when the pressures of life comes
[1:04:56] down up on them it starts flaking off
[1:04:58] that outside exterior hey man i looked
[1:05:00] at it i said that's god called right
[1:05:02] there i said you know that that paint
[1:05:04] may have been guaranteed to last a
[1:05:06] lifetime but there's only one thing
[1:05:07] that's still guaranteed to last
[1:05:09] eternally that's the blood of jesus
[1:05:11] christ amen and the holy ghost it feels
[1:05:13] on the inside it will be there as long
[1:05:16] as you obey it amen as long as you're
[1:05:18] listening to it it will be there amen i
[1:05:21] can look back and see the day i lay my
[1:05:23] sins down i can see the day i was
[1:05:25] cleansed i see the river i went down
[1:05:27] there and got baptized in and then i
[1:05:29] went a second time amen but i said well
[1:05:31] you know i said it was good the first
[1:05:32] time it's going to be even better the
[1:05:33] second time you know because sometimes
[1:05:35] sometimes the first time you go back and
[1:05:37] you look at you say well i've done this
[1:05:38] or i've said this and you know i want to
[1:05:40] get a complete cleansing you know right
[1:05:42] here's the right here it is and then i
[1:05:44] looked at it and i seen my boy my girl
[1:05:45] come up here i seen gabriel lord he was
[1:05:48] my
[1:05:50] i was going to say hellion but i'm not
[1:05:51] going to okay
[1:05:53] too many people watching
[1:05:57] but i've seen
[1:05:59] once you are in the presence of god
[1:06:03] once that you ever enter in
[1:06:06] you go beyond that veil of looking out
[1:06:10] you're in
[1:06:12] brother brahem talks about he says you
[1:06:13] got to come out go in and go up
[1:06:16] once you get in behind that veil
[1:06:19] and i've seen a man change
[1:06:22] i seen him changing his spirit
[1:06:24] and he's talking
[1:06:26] in the way that he wasn't he wasn't a
[1:06:28] dirty talker he was he's always been a
[1:06:30] cheerful fellow and he was always the
[1:06:31] life of the party and all that and that
[1:06:33] maybe got him in trouble but you know
[1:06:35] the devil used that to make him more
[1:06:37] important to the outside world
[1:06:39] he will use whatever he can to keep you
[1:06:41] away from the glory of god and i've seen
[1:06:44] god change him in such a way
[1:06:47] and not
[1:06:48] not over time it was an instant change
[1:06:51] when he came up out of that water
[1:06:53] there was a change inside of his body
[1:06:55] inside of his soul that made him
[1:06:57] different when he walked from that day
[1:06:58] forth even when he was in his house he's
[1:07:00] got brother branham going on he's got
[1:07:02] all these he's spiritually minded all
[1:07:04] the time and moving forward and malachi
[1:07:07] caught hold of that wave and each one of
[1:07:09] us there was a lot that got baptized got
[1:07:10] a hold of that wave and they said i want
[1:07:12] to get in there i want to get in when
[1:07:14] the water's troubled don't just stand
[1:07:16] there look get into that water amen get
[1:07:18] into that water that god would move by
[1:07:20] his spirit and change you from this
[1:07:22] mortal to immortality because right at
[1:07:25] that time your body may not know it but
[1:07:27] you're going to be changed in a moment a
[1:07:28] twinkling of an eye into a younger being
[1:07:31] brother meadows back here all of a
[1:07:32] sudden he'll be going shh you're talking

[1:08:47] moral like him every day and man people

[1:08:55] you at all times don't ever lose your
[1:08:57] touch with jesus christ amen if you find

[1:09:39] him run and i was like glory to god i
[1:09:41] said now he's running
[1:09:44] okay but i'm gonna tell you what that
[1:09:45] was one step that was one black eye one
[1:09:48] black guy every time ronnie gets up here
[1:09:50] that's another black eye and then every
[1:09:52] time you sit down in that pew and praise
[1:09:54] god that's another black eye i want to
[1:09:56] continue to give that devil a black eye
[1:09:58] from a time he gets up in the morning
[1:09:59] till the time he goes to bed i want to
[1:10:01] continue to block him up and then you
[1:10:04] continue to work that whip take that
[1:10:06] sword of the word of god and cut him
[1:10:08] down every time that he comes up and you
[1:10:11] just sit there and you whack him and you
[1:10:13] whack him thank you lord jesus you're
[1:10:15] there with me all the time amen i may be
[1:10:18] going through the one the roughest day
[1:10:19] just start praising god just start
[1:10:22] praising god and lifting up his name
[1:10:24] because that's the kind of god i serve
[1:10:26] tonight and then he would be with you
[1:10:28] even in you until the end of the world
[1:10:31] glory to god the man
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:41] god is good
[1:10:46] but when they shall lead you
[1:10:47] and deliver you up
[1:10:49] take no thought beforehand what you
[1:10:51] shall speak
[1:10:52] you just let god do it many times we
[1:10:55] want to take it upon ourselves i'm going
[1:10:56] to fight this battle they want to come
[1:10:58] at me about being baptized in the name
[1:11:00] of the lord jesus christ i'm going to
[1:11:01] show them a thing or two no let god lead
[1:11:04] you
[1:11:05] let god let you take and let that word
[1:11:07] come out of you it becomes more than
[1:11:09] just a man it becomes god in there amen
[1:11:12] moving by his spirit that's jesus christ
[1:11:14] speaking through you amen because what
[1:11:16] have you done you've gotten so close to
[1:11:18] god until his thoughts have become your
[1:11:21] thoughts and you're thinking like he
[1:11:23] would think and you're becoming the word
[1:11:25] of god and then more you're becoming the
[1:11:27] word amen your ability is no longer your
[1:11:30] ability that's jesus christ living on
[1:11:33] the inside of you that's taking it
[1:11:35] moving you by his spirit up into a
[1:11:37] higher realm you no longer looking at it
[1:11:40] saying well should i be baptized in the
[1:11:42] name of the father and the son and the
[1:11:43] holy ghost or should i be baptized in
[1:11:45] jesus name or baptize under paul amen
[1:11:48] but he's looking and saying have you
[1:11:50] received the holy ghost since you
[1:11:51] believed
[1:11:52] have you received the holy ghost that
[1:11:54] you believe and being baptized in jesus
[1:11:56] christ's name you're looking at saying
[1:11:58] that is the name that i'm going to marry
[1:12:00] i'm going to be miss jesus christ amen
[1:12:02] i'm going to be miss jesus christ and i
[1:12:05] had the world you know i'm looking at
[1:12:06] you you're you're you got
[1:12:08] zuku people coming
[1:12:10] okay
[1:12:12] who's gonna be nervous upper
[1:12:15] the bride
[1:12:17] don't take this wrong
[1:12:21] the world right now if they were coming
[1:12:23] to her wedding
[1:12:25] they would not be worried about
[1:12:26] the 19 people standing on this side or
[1:12:29] the 19th standing on this side
[1:12:31] and the preacher they wouldn't be
[1:12:32] worried about that
[1:12:34] they're waiting on the bride
[1:12:36] and they're going to be
[1:12:48] you'll notice i'm not worried about
[1:12:49] those people on the internet they ain't
[1:12:51] here
[1:12:53] but they're gonna be looking the bride
[1:12:54] of christ over from head to toe as soon
[1:12:58] as they find something that is out of
[1:13:00] alignment with the word that they know
[1:13:02] they're gonna call you out on it
[1:13:04] i say bring it on because the word
[1:13:06] that's on the inside of me when i'm
[1:13:08] brought up against that i am letting
[1:13:10] jesus christ take over and man they may
[1:13:12] look at me and say well you shouldn't do
[1:13:14] this or shouldn't do that
[1:13:16] well i'm going to do better could go
[1:13:18] well i'll black your eye there's a lot
[1:13:20] of people that say we get in a fight
[1:13:21] over that job's witnesses
[1:13:24] they're dedicated to what they do i
[1:13:25] don't know if y'all ever have them come
[1:13:26] to your house
[1:13:28] they don't come to mind anymore
[1:13:31] i love them
[1:13:32] amen and probably tomorrow they'll
[1:13:34] probably show up
[1:13:35] but you know you know i say you give me
[1:13:37] your time
[1:13:39] and i'm giving you my time but i said i
[1:13:41] want time back
[1:13:42] they don't come back now
[1:13:45] because when they can prove to me that
[1:13:47] they're jehovah
[1:13:50] of the old
[1:13:51] mine is jesus christ of the new
[1:13:54] there shall be no other name above that
[1:13:55] name
[1:13:56] hey man i ain't putting i just tell you
[1:13:58] just like it is jesus christ is my lord
[1:14:00] and savior amen he's the god that was
[1:14:02] incarnated he'd come to this earth amen
[1:14:04] we're for we're so compassed about amen
[1:14:07] that was jesus christ he not only came
[1:14:09] down for you he walks around you and
[1:14:11] he's in you we're so far we're so
[1:14:14] compassed about we have jesus christ
[1:14:16] living on the inside of us moving us
[1:14:18] from day to day i thank god for that
[1:14:20] tonight amen i look it down i say teach
[1:14:22] me lord to do thy will amen more now
[1:14:25] than ever am i don't don't let me be my
[1:14:27] own own maker let me be the will of
[1:14:29] jesus christ that god you can move
[1:14:31] through me amen because there was a time
[1:14:33] i would not ever get up here and preach
[1:14:35] amen
[1:14:36] but there was something that came in
[1:14:38] that took me out of the way
[1:14:41] took me from where i was to where i am
[1:14:44] because many times we say each one of us
[1:14:46] has a part to play there's big churches
[1:14:49] or small churches so when you think
[1:14:50] you're small i always put it back when
[1:14:52] you're trying to start a fire
[1:14:54] you don't get the biggest stick you got
[1:14:56] in the pile and stick it in the stove
[1:14:59] you get some of the most insignificant
[1:15:01] sticks that are laying there
[1:15:03] they're they're ready
[1:15:05] they've been dried out
[1:15:06] they're ready you put them in there and
[1:15:08] you start a little fire underneath them
[1:15:11] hey man and then all of a sudden it
[1:15:12] starts building up more and more it's
[1:15:14] then you can bring the big sticks in hey
[1:15:16] man but don't be thinking you're just
[1:15:17] i'm a small one at church i'm the quiet
[1:15:19] one oh i hold up the corner amen and i
[1:15:22] hold up the corner right but no it's
[1:15:24] praise you lord
[1:15:26] thank you lord i've come to praise god i
[1:15:28] don't know what you came to do but i
[1:15:30] came to praise the lord i don't know
[1:15:33] what you came to do i came to praise the
[1:15:35] lord hey man that's the way it should be
[1:15:38] when you walk through those doors back
[1:15:39] there let me enter with thanksgiving on
[1:15:41] my heart and then for another
[1:15:43] opportunity to step in the presence of
[1:15:45] god it ain't the building it's the place
[1:15:47] where people come to worship he said
[1:15:49] where two or three gathered in my name
[1:15:51] that jesus christ himself would be there
[1:15:53] in the midst i'm believing he's here
[1:15:55] tonight you know you say well that's
[1:15:57] just a simple sermon to believe on jesus
[1:15:58] christ if that's what you need to
[1:16:00] believe on him then that's what you need
[1:16:02] because one day he will take you to
[1:16:04] higher realms he will take you to a
[1:16:06] place where you've never been that
[1:16:08] you're going back to your regular home
[1:16:09] hey man our home is in heaven amen with
[1:16:12] jesus christ because i was in his
[1:16:13] thoughts
[1:16:15] before the foundation of the earth
[1:16:18] i was there he knew me
[1:16:20] he knew me he predestinated me he seen
[1:16:23] me sitting here he seen me doing the
[1:16:25] will of christ he said that's my son
[1:16:27] that's my daughter hey man i know why
[1:16:29] you don't have grandson and
[1:16:31] grandchildren
[1:16:32] i know why you don't you say well that's
[1:16:33] bad well i'll tell you i got two i'm
[1:16:35] just learning
[1:16:37] sarah's got me 14 coming hey man when we
[1:16:40] look at this we see well i see
[1:16:42] there's nothing
[1:16:44] there is nothing
[1:16:46] that i wouldn't try to do for my
[1:16:48] grandkids or correct them
[1:16:50] you know a true father and a true mother
[1:16:54] i look back and i go man
[1:16:56] oh i hope i don't turn out like my dad
[1:16:59] oh he goes to church all the time oh
[1:17:02] lord i got to do something i got to do
[1:17:04] something but you know when christ come
[1:17:06] in i'm like i want to be more like him i
[1:17:08] want to i want to praise god more i want
[1:17:10] to be walking in his presence all the
[1:17:11] time and i start going i want to be like
[1:17:13] jesus christ amen it ever comes of
[1:17:15] mankind it becomes jesus kind amen and
[1:17:18] we look at that we see god moving by his
[1:17:20] spirit but he's bringing you to a higher
[1:17:22] height he's bringing you up to a higher
[1:17:24] height that we can live where he lives
[1:17:27] we can walk where he walks amen that he
[1:17:29] will be there with us wherefore we're
[1:17:31] compassed about but when that
[1:17:32] chastisement this life comes down upon
[1:17:34] you it ain't the end of the world i see
[1:17:36] the chastisement going up on my brother
[1:17:39] i see the things that's going on and
[1:17:40] things are being said and things are
[1:17:42] going on in his life and i look at how i
[1:17:44] say god has been there with him i would
[1:17:46] never dare not say anything about him
[1:17:48] amen but i let god do the work inside of
[1:17:51] him and he is speaking he is his most
[1:17:53] soft spoken person i mean he just lays
[1:17:56] it right out there and just delivers you
[1:17:58] all messages i mean it's like steak
[1:18:00] every night for you all and i'm like
[1:18:01] glory to god you know and you look at it
[1:18:03] you say well i gave you a bologna
[1:18:05] sandwich tonight and you look at it you
[1:18:06] see you see that i am blessed
[1:18:09] i'm blessed to be able to sit here and
[1:18:12] partake of this end time word of god
[1:18:14] amen and i wonder you know sometimes i
[1:18:17] have to go brother brown i heard him say
[1:18:18] it so i'm going to say it he said if
[1:18:19] there's one going in jeffersonville
[1:18:22] it's me
[1:18:25] verse one going
[1:18:27] in charlottesville it's me
[1:18:29] it's gonna be brother madison i think if
[1:18:31] i was here if i'm here tonight it would
[1:18:33] be me i'm sorry
[1:18:36] you have to have that will of god to not
[1:18:38] let anybody anything anything this world
[1:18:41] could do
[1:18:42] you don't let nothing hold you back from
[1:18:45] getting closer to jesus christ because
[1:18:47] you need to make it up within your mind
[1:18:49] you're going beyond your own ability
[1:18:52] man would turn around woman would turn
[1:18:54] around but your ability that's been put
[1:18:57] inside of you goes beyond what you are
[1:19:00] it goes beyond your own thinking who
[1:19:02] would have thought a man with stage four
[1:19:04] cancer and his brain would be standing
[1:19:06] up here and delivering and remembering
[1:19:08] words and remembering oh some of the
[1:19:10] characters that he brings out and then
[1:19:12] he also takes the word of god and he
[1:19:14] opens up naaman don't enjoy that
[1:19:18] i'll tell you what
[1:19:24] i honestly cannot i i just
[1:19:28] looking it's just like he stepped back
[1:19:29] in time and watched him as he walked
[1:19:32] through life
[1:19:35] okay i said you know the unveiling of
[1:19:37] god
[1:19:42] my wife bought me a dog pen
[1:19:46] she said this is free birthday
[1:19:48] you're gonna have a dog and i'm like i
[1:19:50] don't want a dog
[1:19:52] i got four now sorry gabriel
[1:19:55] i don't want them to i don't want them
[1:19:56] all i just i'm not a dog person
[1:20:01] so today
[1:20:03] i got out there and decided i'd build it
[1:20:06] well i sit down on
[1:20:08] there's a point to this
[1:20:12] i got down there and i cut the box open
[1:20:14] big old box
[1:20:16] opened it
[1:20:19] there's a piece
[1:20:20] so i packed all the pieces that was
[1:20:22] there
[1:20:23] and i said that's one of the funniest
[1:20:24] looking
[1:20:25] dog pens i've ever seen
[1:20:29] didn't have no instruction i found the
[1:20:30] screws i'm like this thing had to be
[1:20:33] made in china
[1:20:35] so
[1:20:37] i'm like well if i match up the pieces
[1:20:38] and i make this thing work and i sent i
[1:20:41] sent chris the text well i actually
[1:20:42] tried to call her but what in the world
[1:20:44] have you done wasting my money on this
[1:20:45] dog pen and it'll look like a dog pen
[1:20:49] and i'm a mechanic i can figure things
[1:20:51] out
[1:20:53] i sit there and look at it
[1:20:55] i look at it longer just look like a big
[1:20:57] mess of wood
[1:20:59] wire and screws
[1:21:02] so then i found the instructions
[1:21:08] alrighty
[1:21:10] she goes it's not a dog
[1:21:12] pen it's a chicken pen
[1:21:19] all my chickens get eaten by the local
[1:21:20] dogs
[1:21:22] so she got me a chicken bin
[1:21:24] that's the reason it makes sense
[1:21:35] i said that to say this
[1:21:38] we sat here many times
[1:21:43] and we read this word of god
[1:21:47] we read it
[1:21:49] we read it
[1:21:50] and we read it
[1:21:54] and it's just words
[1:21:57] but when the prophet of god
[1:22:00] when your pastor gets up here
[1:22:02] each one of them start delivering it out
[1:22:04] there all of a sudden
[1:22:06] these instructions that we're reading
[1:22:09] becomes life
[1:22:12] becomes the living word of god
[1:22:16] now you're taking it in
[1:22:18] not just reading it
[1:22:20] to whom that understandeth
[1:22:23] understandeth and that means that now no
[1:22:26] longer are you in a doghouse
[1:22:28] you've got a chicken coop
[1:22:30] and it's the same thing here no longer
[1:22:32] am i baptist methodist presbyterian i am
[1:22:36] the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:38] amen you can't even put it down i'll
[1:22:40] read and bring it down even further you
[1:22:41] can't even say well i go to the full
[1:22:43] gospel lighthouse
[1:22:44] that's where i go to church at no
[1:22:47] when it becomes a revelation into your
[1:22:49] heart
[1:22:51] the word becomes alive and living inside
[1:22:53] of your life
[1:22:54] that no longer is a dead letter but it's
[1:22:57] the living word of god that has came
[1:23:00] into your life and now it's being
[1:23:03] reflected
[1:23:04] it's been reflected back out
[1:23:07] and i looked at it the other night they
[1:23:08] have all these planets and things that's
[1:23:09] going on the moon and they say the star
[1:23:12] of bethlehem is coming and all this and
[1:23:14] you look at all this
[1:23:15] but without
[1:23:17] the sunlight
[1:23:18] there there'd be nothing but a dead rock
[1:23:21] you'd never know they're out there so
[1:23:23] when you think that you're all on your
[1:23:24] own
[1:23:25] take a look up at those stars
[1:23:27] and you see the light shining on me you
[1:23:30] can't see the light
[1:23:31] but you know it's up there
[1:23:33] and it begins to lighten up those stars
[1:23:35] you say that's exactly what i'm doing
[1:23:37] i'm reflecting jesus christ
[1:23:40] the holy ghost that lives within me puts
[1:23:42] a glow about me that others can see
[1:23:44] jesus christ that's what i want to be
[1:23:46] tonight i want to be closer to christ
[1:23:48] let us stand
[1:23:50] our most precious and divine heavenly
[1:23:52] father
[1:23:53] dear lord jesus lord i thank you lord
[1:23:55] for this time that we've had lord to
[1:23:57] refresh our minds lord jesus lord and we
[1:24:00] think about the goodness of your love
[1:24:01] and the hidden things that's been
[1:24:03] revealed to us in this day and this hour
[1:24:05] lord it was not it was hidden all the
[1:24:07] way down through time but there was a
[1:24:09] predestinated time that your word would
[1:24:12] become enlightened to word that we are
[1:24:14] the mark 16 church lord we are a part of
