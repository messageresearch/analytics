[Music] And right now, I'm choosing to believe that someday soon I'll look back and see. All the pain had a purpose. Your plan was perfect all along. This is the truth. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Let's stand this morning key of B flat as brother Ron prepares to come this morning. When I come into his presence, I humble myself. I lift up both my hands and I begin to work your pain. Oh, I worship him when I come into his presence. I humble myself. [Music] I lift up both my hands and I begin to worship him. Oh, I worship him.

Thank you, brother Alen, for that this morning. I was thinking as he was given that, you'd have heard brother Homer give that. Some of you old-timers, he could make your toes feel like they were curling under the thing, and you would thought you was all guilty and you wasn't guilty of lick. But Amen. Amen. Was it brother Jim that would say every time brother Homer would preach, he said, "Felt like I the further I put my feet back under the pew, the further brother Homer reached it." So, Amen. And brother Jim Lamb, I believe it was. And Amen. Good to Thank you, brother Alen. And thank all of you. We're a family here. &gt;&gt; We're a family. We certainly love you with all of our hearts. and and uh thank you for everything that you do for the kingdom of God and looking forward to a great meeting and uh we got great preachers coming and and uh we're getting ready for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you don't think we're getting ready for the coming of the Lord, they're putting nuclear subs right beside of Russia. All that tells you we got to go home. &gt;&gt; That tells you we got to go home. So we just thank the Lord for that. Amen. and any good to us. And thank you for each and every one of you this morning. Amen. I just have a couple of announcements I want to make. I didn't even ask you this morning if I could do this, but um I know I know sometimes we take things away. If you were, you know, if you're a parent and you want to take things away from your children that they shouldn't be doing, well, I believe in replacement. Give them something back that's good. And so, uh for instance, music. If you don't want them to listen to country and rock, give them good music to listen to. And and if there's things you don't want them to watch, give them good things that you want them to watch. And and uh uh brother Gabriel here is is uh is doing a daily devotional and I've been reading it and listening to it and uh it's on YouTube. It's at Revelations Revelation 10:1. And uh I think you would really enjoy that. That's a good way. Listen, book in your days, reading your Bible and praying. So, devotions is something that you need to do. And so, Brother Gabriel is doing that. Also, if Brother Williams been here for quite a while, and he's been doing this for a while, but I'll just make mention of it again because I sure enjoy it. Visual melodies. He takes us all over the world. And and uh it's good music that goes along with it. And and if you say, "Well, Brother Ron, I want to travel, but I don't have no money." Well, Brother Brother Williams made it so that you can go all over the world and and uh he has it's got some just beautiful uh scenes and settings that are there and music. I didn't ask you cuz I figured you'd tell me no. And so there it is. And so uh we thank God for everything that you do for the kingdom of God. And I I don't know. I didn't make yours public, brother Jim. But Brother Jim sends me and I think he he's shaking his head. know, but brother Jim sends me a quotation every morning from the scriptures and I sure appreciate that if you're on his if you're on his list that he does it. But I think he just sends that one at a time and one at a time and not hundreds at a time. But but I'd like to thank you, brother Jim. And uh each and every one of you that sends me a little something to encourage me, thank you. Thank you. I'll probably get a thousand in the morning, but A guy sent me a note this morning said, "Why don't why aren't you send why are you not send responding to my text?" And I said, "You know, after I get about 50 at one time, I cannot respond to every one of them. So, if I don't respond to your text, I'll try to get to you." And so, but we love you with all of our hearts. I'll respond to your text better than I'll respond to your call. So, Amen. Amen. God bless you. We sure love you this morning. If you will turn with me to Matthew chapter 5 and verse 13. Amen. Turn look at your neighbor and say, "I'm glad to be in church with you this morning." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, you can do two things at one time. Matthew chapter 5 and verse 13. This is Jesus speaking in red letter edition for you. You're the salt of the earth. I think it's powerful. This is a powerful statement. Ye are the salt of the earth. But if the salt hath lost its savior, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trotten under the foot of men. You are the light of the world, a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto the all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven. Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy the but to fulfill. That's quite incredible. I'm not come to destroy but fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled. Amen. Maybe you have a need on your heart this morning. You just like to say, "Lord, would you please remember me?" Amen. I sure I sure have a need from the Lord. Lord Jesus, we ask you this morning that you'd come among us in a special way. Now, Father, we have great needs. I stand here have a need today. I ask you that you would help us in a special way. Strengthen us, Father. We have needs that you would come by our way. And Father, we're promised. We left our house this morning, drove here some long distance with expectation that you would come by. Now, Father, I invite you to where I'm at. Come and touch us today. We pray in the name of Jesus Christ, we ask you. Amen. And amen and amen. Amen. God bless you this morning. Amen. You can be seated. And the congregation said, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. We just returned from brother Tom Rays and the family there and at the meeting and had a wonderful time. Uh these guys did a great job preaching. Matthew just hit a home run. Amen. And so we just of course Andrew did, but we expect that from him. And so I don't know how lunch will be at my house today, but uh but Matthew just hit an absolute home run and we he spoke on friends and it was absolutely great and we sure enjoyed that. And there was a couple bloopers that was in there that made us all come to attention and so if you haven't listened to it, go back and listen to it, catch the bloopers, you'll enjoy it. and and we all enjoyed uh being there. God just did some incredible incredible things. And just to share share one we brother Glenn Grunard has been a friend of mine for many many years and brother Glenn I I didn't know it but brother Glenn had suffered with s his neck a cervical condition and about seven years and he'd just been in incredible pain hadn't been able to sleep on a pillow and so you can imagine what that's been like for the last seven years and so anyways he had went to the doctors and The doctors told him said, "If we operated on it, it's only 50% chance of being able to help you. 50% chance of paralysis being in your body." And so, Brother Glenn said, "Well, I'll just I'll just take my chances and and live with it." During the meeting, um, I called out brother Glenn. Uh, I saw something supernatural there and I called out brother Glenn and I had no idea what was going on. And God 100% healed brother Glenn of that condition. Another that was very probably only a handful of people know this, but uh brother Murphy Wong and his wife was was fellowshipping with us at the end of the meeting on Sunday evening. And so uh she's just a sister Tracy is just a precious a precious lady. And so when we were in China, they they would if we were wiping with a paper towel, they'd come and get that paper towel for prayer cloth. And so, Sister Tracy on Saturday evening had told Brother Murphy said, "Would you would you when Brother Ron gets finished eating, would you get his napkin for me?" And so, you know, somebody else took my tray and and tossed it and she they didn't get a chance for to get my napkin. Of course, I didn't know nothing about it. So, after he we had spent some time in fellowship, he told me he said, "Brother Ron, can I can I have your napkin?" And I thought, "Okay." He said, "Sister Tracy would like to have your napkin as a prayer cloth." And just as he said that, the spirit of the Lord spoke to me. And in my Bible, I carry I carry a very precious uh prayer cloth that was given to me many years ago. And I've carried it and it's been in every sermon that I that I've spoke here. And uh I've carried that prayer cloth that's been sacred to me. You know, some things are sacred to you. And so a voice spoke to me in my ear and said, "Go get your prayer cloth out of your Bible and cut it in two." And so I just I said, "Can you just hold here just for a moment?" And so I ran to my cabin and got my Bible that lays here. And I I pulled a prayer cloth and told them what it meant to me and that that voice had spoke to me and to cut it in two. And as I was cutting in it too and trying to get it to hold still, Sister Connie laid her hand on it. Sister Tracy laid her hand on it. Brother Murphy laid his hand on it. And I begin to cut it in two. And when I cut it in two, the spirit of God dropped, just flooded the place. And I'll have to be honest with you, I hadn't felt it quite like that in a long time. And so I begin to pray with Sister Tracy and I didn't know her needs. Don't know them today, but I just know this that God did a very special thing for us as we sat there. I I believe he'll come where you ask him to come. And so I believe if you will ask him this morning, he'll come to where you're at. &gt;&gt; Even right now, Brother Brandham says this. He said Jesus always goes where he is invited. No matter where it's at, he will come. He'll come to a lion's den. One time he said to a fiery furnace. I believe it was David said, "I will make my bed in hell and he will be there." Quite a statement, isn't it? He will come to the poorest, to the richest, to the most immoral, to the meanest, to the lowest. &gt;&gt; Is this microphone working? &gt;&gt; He will come to the poorest, &gt;&gt; to the richest, &gt;&gt; to the most immoral, to the meanest, to the lowest. He will come anywhere he's invited. No matter what your conditions and your position in life, he will still come. That makes him God to me. Humble. I will be there. Go to your master. Go tell your master. I will be there. At a such and such date, I will be there. That comes out of meanest man that I know. I would like to speak to you this morning on God bringing order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; This means a whole lot to me this morning and I I've never spoke along this line, but many years ago I had a lung condition because I was burned. And being burned, it scarred my lungs and I was having just continual one right after another infections in my lungs. The doctor said I wouldn't live, but God worked a miracle for us. And we were laying in a in a in a in a in a coma induced coma for quite a while. And I actually later would fly in a plane to Philadelphia to where that the doctor that placed me in the coma, he said, "When I looked and scoped your lungs, he said there was nothing but soot there." And he said, "No way did I expect you to live." and he said, "I watched over your case." He was from Harrisonenberg, "I watched over your case while you was at UVA." And he said, "You're a miracle." By chance. You talk about ch by chance. He actually once we had that conversation, we got on the plane and we had seats right side by side. I don't believe God does anything and by by mistake. And while we was flying in the plane, he we was just about to land. He said, "Ron, would you pray for my mother? I'm going to to see my mother and she's in very bad condition." And he said, "Would you pray for me?" He said, "I need prayers." He said, "I believe you're the real deal." So, so we suffered with that lung condition for about a year and we would go and preach the meeting at Mount Baker where we just spoke at. And when we came back the very next week, Brother Biscllow was at at the North Carolina camp that just happened this week. And and so we were there, Brother Homer and myself and and Connie and Sister Nancy and many of you were sitting in that meeting. And brother Biscoll uses this text. Well, I've actually asked several people, can you find Can you find this sermon on the internet? Can you find it on the internet? Cuz I I asked I asked chat, "Could you find it?" I looked on all different kinds of sites. Where where is that? You'll enjoy this. And so I was telling Brother William about what I was speaking this morning. I said, "You know, I'd look for brother Biscll's sermon, bringing order out of chaos." And I had to look for it and look for it and look for it and couldn't find it. Well, Brother William sent it to me this morning. &gt;&gt; It's on our site. Well, I looked everywhere but our site. And so this evening, Brother William, I'm going to I'm going to listen to it. get didn't get time this morning to listen but and in that sermon brother Biscll is preaching and I'm going to use a couple of things here but brother Biscll is preaching and when he comes down to a certain spot God just inspired me now's your opportunity to stand and I just stood and raised my hands when I stood and raised my hands I put my head back like this and it felt like an oxygen tent came down over top of me and was pressing into my lungs it actually felt like my lungs were going to blow up. And when that left me from that time to this time, I've never had a lung infection again. [Applause] There was a lady that was sitting in a wheelchair about 15 ft from me and she got out of that wheelchair at the same time that I got healed. The prophet of God said, "This world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the earth and there was nothing but a complete chaos and the world was in that condition and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water and the entire picture was changed like he said from a total chaos to a garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; That is the transforming power of God that can taste something that's nothing and make something that's wonderful out of it. &gt;&gt; God's transforming power. Yes. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1 said, "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." And notice these next verse, chapter 2, verse two, "And the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the water. And God and God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Listen, it wasn't some big boom somewhere or another. &gt;&gt; It wasn't some Darwin theory. God created the heavens and the earth. &gt;&gt; God created the heavens and the earth. Brother Brandham said that the earth was like a ball of ice. And it says that God be to move it near the sun and it begin to melt. And out of all of that chaos &gt;&gt; out of that without form or void, totally useless, God be to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God be to work. And if we could, all of us would like to go to the Garden of Eden. God begin to work. And it began be begin to be a perfect harmony of what God had in his mind. &gt;&gt; Then not going to stay here, but Adam, God made Adam in spirit form to rule and to keep the Garden of Eden &gt;&gt; because remember chaos was all over the earth except &gt;&gt; except for the Garden of Eden. and he was watching over it. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it's just like your life. Our lives was without form. &gt;&gt; And we were void without God in our lives. &gt;&gt; The scripture says in Isaiah 55 and verse 6, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found. Call upon him while he is near." Let me just say if you feel the spirit of God come near to you in a service, take advantage. &gt;&gt; If you feel the spirit of God come near to you in a service, don't miss your opportunity. &gt;&gt; Don't miss your opportunity, brother. But I've walked to the altar many times. When he is near, &gt;&gt; when he is near, you want to capture that opportunity. &gt;&gt; Don't miss it. &gt;&gt; I know of people that missed their opportunity. And and one in particular told me, he said, "It was decades before I felt that again. I don't want to waste I don't want to waste a day. I don't want to waste a year, much less 20 years. &gt;&gt; Let the wicked forsake his way, the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him. And to our God, he will abundantly pardon. &gt;&gt; Not man pardon, God pardon. Man will remember. &gt;&gt; Man will hold it against you. &gt;&gt; Man can't keep a secret. &gt;&gt; Man will always bring it up at an odd time. But God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; He puts it in the sea of forgiveness and he never brings it up to you again. your memory will or another person will, but God never brings it up. &gt;&gt; You can shout all you want to right there. Notice this. For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said he, brother Brandham's speaking now. He said, he that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out. &gt;&gt; He said, I believe it once coming under the blood, take his word for anything that he says. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every believer, here it is. Get it? Every man or woman that has once been brought under the blood of Christ, all fear and condemnation is gone. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Bringing order to the chaos. Once under the blood, brought under the blood of Christ, all fear and condemnation is gone. &gt;&gt; I think it's so important. I I want you to I want you to catch it. Once brought under the blood of Christ, let's say that together. Once brought under the blood of Christ, all fear and condemnation is gone. Then he will believe every word that God writes in the Bible to the truth. He will not say this is not inspired and that's not inspired. But he said every word &gt;&gt; every word come to the fountain of and that is filled with blood drawn from Emanuel's brain. Oh, what a wonderful savior that we have. What a plan of redemption. Jehovah alone lotted out for us, laid out the carpet for us to come home. &gt;&gt; There's always a coming home. And there's nothing like a coming home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the world was without form and it was void and darkness was upon the face of the earth. Nothing but a complete chaos and this world was in that condition and the spirit of God moved upon it upon the face. He says and then that entire picture changed. Brother Ron you just read that but I want you to get it. That is the transforming power of God. &gt;&gt; This quote's a bit lengthy, but I I want I want to drop it to you here. Is everybody okay to learn to look over to your neighbor? This comes out of the church age book. He says, "But now he is standing in the midst of the church." You know, he was in the midst of the seven candlesticks. And as he stands there revealing who it is in the last age, he calls himself the author of the creation of God. And he said, "This is not another creation &gt;&gt; that has to do with the church. This is a special designation of himself. He is the creator of that church. The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? He's talking about you. &gt;&gt; He that created the earth created you. &gt;&gt; And you're a special designation of people. Oh, brother. just felt it and I came. Let me just say, no man can come unless the spirit of God draws him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We wasn't looking for God. &gt;&gt; We were happy about what we were doing, but God rich in mercy &gt;&gt; came looking for you. Listen, it wasn't no I did, I did, I did. He He is He is what we have. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I can do nothing except my father shows me first." And if Jesus couldn't, &gt;&gt; that's the spirit of God. He came down and created in the Virgin Mary the cells from which his body was born. He said, I want to repeat that he created the very cells in the womb of Mary for that body. &gt;&gt; It was not enough for the Holy Spirit to simply give life to a human over him supplied by Mary. That would have been sinful mankind producing a body that would have not produced the last Adam of him as it was said low a body thou the father prepared for me God not Mary prepared pro provided that body Mary was the human incubator and she carried that holy child and brought him to birth it was a God man. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It was a God man. He was the son of God. He was the new creation. The first Adam fell. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But this Adam won't fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man and God met and joined. He was the first of a new race. He is the head of the new race. 1 Corinthians 1:18. He is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, &gt;&gt; the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, notice these words. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Amen. He is a new creation &gt;&gt; cuz no man can do that. This is not about reformation. &gt;&gt; This is not about creating a new vow. &gt;&gt; We need God in his new creation &gt;&gt; to come and sweep into our lives. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have passed away. Behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; You're talking about bringing order to chaos. Before I go any further, our lives were just chaos. &gt;&gt; If a man's without Christ, this is chaos. Brother Ron, it didn't look like chaos to me. I was the life of the party. You were on your way to hell. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You were on your way to hell. You didn't know you had a predestinated seed that was coming to get you. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You were you were you were enjoying bud or you were enjoying cars or you enjoying a cigarette or you were enjoying sports teams or you were enjoying this or that. &gt;&gt; You're enjoying all of the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Listen, there's no eternal life to that. &gt;&gt; There's no eternal life to seeing and fox. There's no eternal life to all of the education of the world. There's nothing there. &gt;&gt; Well, I I I'm a I'm a Washington fan. No eternal life to that. I'm a Cowboy fan. There's no eternal life to that. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's just entertainment. &gt;&gt; We were we were chasing after things that was very temporal. People sit in prisons now that'll spend the rest of their life because they had a bad day &gt;&gt; or they got under the influence of a certain thing. &gt;&gt; But God, rich in mercy, watched over your life &gt;&gt; and guided you so that you wouldn't be in there. &gt;&gt; You could sit here this morning. [Applause] Some of you were a Methodist. My mother was a Methodist. My father told her, said, "We're going to have to break up because you know you being a Methodist, you won't believe this." She said, "Charlie, you need to give me a chance. &gt;&gt; You need to give me a chance at the word." Listen, I've heard this story so many times. You need to listen. My mother was a beautiful woman. She had been a cheerleader. And I'm not telling you she was beautiful because she was, but she was voted the most beautiful in her class. She could have done a lot of things in life. She was the life of the party. But here she meets this guy predestinated. &gt;&gt; Predestinated. And so my father told my grandmother that she was a beautiful woman. He worked with her. She said, "If you think I'm beautiful, you ought to meet my daughter." So he met her daughter and that daughter become his wife. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I was born 9 hours, 9 months and two hours later after they got married. They called him Lightning. I don't care how they called him. I am glad I'm here. But when she heard the word, she went back to her Methodist church and she said, "I'll no longer be here. I believe a message." And they said, "You'll go to hell leaving the Methodist church." Well, it didn't work out like that. It didn't work out like that. Maybe you were in the Baptist. Maybe you were in the Amish and they come and said, "But you're leaving our order. &gt;&gt; You're leaving the Catholic order, or you're leaving that order." No. God was bringing order to your chaos. And let me just tell you about that chaos. You didn't even know how many gods there were. &gt;&gt; You couldn't explain Godhead. 321. &gt;&gt; You didn't know how to be baptized in many of those organizations. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? were married to the church. They felt like that was okay. You were you had your name on the book, but God was telling you, there's another book. &gt;&gt; I wrote your name down before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; It's not in some book down here that can be burned up. &gt;&gt; It's not in there some church that's 100 foot wide and 200 foot deep. You're the bride of Jesus Christ. You're not some church member. You're the bride. &gt;&gt; I slipped the wedding band of predestinated grace on you before the foundation of the world. That ought to be enough to shout about. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I redeemed you. Not some man did it. I redeemed you. &gt;&gt; I saved you. &gt;&gt; We needed a prophet &gt;&gt; to bring order to our chaos. [Applause] We needed an Apostle Paul to write the first the New Testament &gt;&gt; to bring order. &gt;&gt; Trying to behave not going to behave much longer here. So now we go back to that scripture 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17. Therefore, if any man, woman, boy or girl, be in Christ, he is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things have passed away, and behold, all things are become new. There you can see that through that that man of that old order of creation now in the union with Christ he has become new creation. &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 10. For if for we are his workmanship, &gt;&gt; created in union with Christ Jesus under good works. Ephesians 4 and verse 24. And that ye have put on a new man which is after God created in righteousness and true holiness. The new creation is not the old creation made over. You're not bringing the old things over to the new. &gt;&gt; That's dead. &gt;&gt; I met the old Stephanie. And she was coming here for a man and she got one. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Just happened. Jerry went along with it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I met many of you under the old creation. But under the new, &gt;&gt; under the new, it becomes a new world order. And I'm not talking about this nonsense of politics. &gt;&gt; The new creation is not the old made over or it could be called or it could not be called a new creation. That is exactly what it is. It's not the old one patched up. I was I cut my arm the other day and we were we were out and and this guy brought a first aid kit and so I have condition in my arms to where the the cancer is real close to the skin. So so it makes my arms bleed. At first, we thought it was because we were taking thinners and that was part of it, but but the cancer has come real close to the skin because it's skin cancer and so it'll just bust at any time. You don't have to hit it. It's all the time busting. And and so we get blood in the bed. We got blood in the bed and we have to take sheets off and Conniey's a trooper. She said, "No problem. No problem." And I'll get blood all over all over the place. And so this guy, he saw all the band-aids on my arm and he said, "You're a patched up guy." He said, "I'm going to put a few more patches on you." And I thought, "No, not in here. I'm not patched up. &gt;&gt; Not in here. I may be patched up on the outside, but on the inside, &gt;&gt; on the inside of me, I'm not patched up. &gt;&gt; God did a new thing on the inside of me. Brother Stephen, you absorb the word so well. But I I just want to drop this to you. There'll come a time in your life you don't remember the old guy. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you'll go, I'm not even like the old guy &gt;&gt; because you're new. &gt;&gt; And you and the old guy are no longer the same. There's a lot of funerals that we go to, but the most closest funeral that you'll ever go to is the death of an old friend. You. And when you bury that guy, and I'm talking about truly burying him, he's dead. And when he dies, you're no longer that guy. &gt;&gt; He used to have habits that you no longer have. &gt;&gt; Help me now. &gt;&gt; He used to have addictions that you no longer have. He used to read things that you no longer read. He used to listen to things that you no longer listen to. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the new man is born. And when he's born, he drives that old man out. &gt;&gt; The new man won't come until the old one is gone. &gt;&gt; God's not an adulterer. He won't live with another head. That first one's got to die. Now, we've got some cancer patients here. And I'm just going to get off off my notes here for a moment. It's in my notes, but it'll take too long to go through them. But cancer, brother Brandham was so far ahead and doctors actually learned from him. But I fought cancer now five and a half years and they have proved the message right. &gt;&gt; They proved the message right. And so cancer is like a crab. It's under the sign of the crab. And cancer will will take on the life of itself. And so, Brother Brandham said it comes from a bruised cell and it'll live on the life of that cell and it'll start living on the lives of other cells and it begins to kill those cells. It's like Satan. Satan can't per he can't create so he perverts. Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll take truth and pervert it. &gt;&gt; See, man will pollute. &gt;&gt; You can always find out about men and what they are. Archaeologists try to find trash piles because they learn from trash piles because in the trash piles, it'll tell them what they ate. It'll tell them their jobs. &gt;&gt; If you want to steal somebody's identity, go to the trash pile. &gt;&gt; I'm not telling nobody to do that. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Because in your trash pile, it'll show what you were. Right. &gt;&gt; So those cells that are in your body that are backsliding, Brother Brandham said cancer will get in them and will live off of your life. Brother Brandon said cancer will hide from that light. It'll hide from the light. And maybe you say, "Well, I don't believe that." Okay. So, what will happen is they'll start doing biopsies and in the biopsy they'll go in there and they'll they'll see that that cell and they'll go to prick it and all of a sudden that cell will hide. How you know? because I've sat and laid while they're working on me. And the doctors will be servable doctors will be working on you and they'll go to prick the cell and all of a sudden it disappears and they'll say, "We know that's cancer. We'll just wait for it to pop back up." So they'll wait. They may wait five minutes. There it is. Boop. And pop it back up. and they'll they'll dream from it and they'll go that you'll go and get a clean scan and that clean scan will show there's nothing there and you go hallelujah glory to the lamb and they'll say wait till next time and we'll see if he was hiding. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother? Aren't you thankful for the clean stand? Yeah. And I want to get hundreds of them. I want to get hundreds of them. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But that devil will try to hide. &gt;&gt; Not just in cancer. &gt;&gt; He'll try to hide in your lustful life. &gt;&gt; And he'll lay there and try to hide. And then years later, he'll want to pop back up. Kill it. &gt;&gt; Keep taking the word of God. God spoke to a world that was without form and void. How did he bring it to order? He spoke to it. Amen. &gt;&gt; He spoke to the word of God. That's how we get faith. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Well, brother, I'm having a good day. Good. But you can't defeat your enemy with a good day. &gt;&gt; You got to take the word of God and constantly keep it before him. He said, "Cancer is one of the great killers. Cancer has a life. It's another life beside your life. It's growing and it's spreading." The Bible calls it a devil. Cancer is called by a medical name the word crab with legs and spreading out. But the real term of it, it's a devil. &gt;&gt; It's a tormentor. &gt;&gt; And it's set in your body and it comes from a little cell that's been bruised. Usually a little cell backslider cannot cause your life. But in a big word for a a big word for a Baptist to say a backslider. He said, "But just the same when a cell backslides, it'll interrupt every cell in your body. &gt;&gt; If the devil can get into that little cell, now the devil cannot create, he cannot create one thing. He can only pervert &gt;&gt; what God has already created. Sin is righteousness perverted. &gt;&gt; Sin is nothing. The devil couldn't even create sin. Think about that. He comes down to another place in God's power to transform. He said, he said, "If that isn't a picture of the world today where Satan is spreading, spraying his unbelief, his hybrid, his science, his knowledge until what it was at the beginning when God and when God put Adam and Eve in the earth, what a beautiful paradise without death, without sickness, without sorrow, everything in perfect order." And look what Satan did. Listen, if we just stayed in the Garden of Eden and Perfect, there had never been a dead baby. &gt;&gt; There had never been one cancer patient. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, there wouldn't even been a hospital built. &gt;&gt; There wouldn't have been a need for police. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, what do you think about this defund the police? That's what they're going to do here. I'm moving. &gt;&gt; But let me just tell you something about defunding police. This is how you do it. Gabe, you can you can straighten me out after service. So was a man named Feny and there was a phenomenal revival broke out and brother Random says that 97% of Feny's converts held and he said he preached with such conviction but Lonzo he he preached to where that men five miles away would drop their lunchboxes and give their heart to Jesus Christ. Hey, listen. I'm not I'm not wishing for five miles away, although it'd be nice, but I'd like for it to go to the back of the building. &gt;&gt; You know, I want this building to be consumed with the presence of God. That's what I pray for in every service. &gt;&gt; I believe, let me just stop here. I believe you drive too far, whether it's 30 minutes or an hour or two hours, you drive too far to come here &gt;&gt; and just sit through a service. &gt;&gt; I believe we come here with an expectation. &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Ron, I've had a bad day. Put it behind you. &gt;&gt; I've got a tough week coming up. Let me just say get just put all that aside. This is the most important day of your week. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil rob you. &gt;&gt; And Finny preached with that atmosphere. I'll tell you what happened to Rochester, New York. So many got saved that the police didn't have nothing to do. jails emptied out. That's a good defund the police. How many of you ever heard for the barbershop quartet? You guys live under a rock? I'm g say it again. How many ever heard of the barbershop quartets? Well, they were actually not barbershop haircut cutters. They were police officers that traveled all over Rochester and sang gospel hymns cuz they didn't have to take care of the town cuz they were a Christian society. &gt;&gt; Not making something up here. That's how you define it. &gt;&gt; We're going to a land. &gt;&gt; We're going to a new Jerusalem. where Jesus Christ is the king over it. &gt;&gt; No hospitals. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No rehab centers. &gt;&gt; He's calling the chaos of this life to an order. &gt;&gt; To a real order. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; What happened that night in North Carolina? All of that, all of that chaos in my lungs, the word. &gt;&gt; The word called this body to an order. &gt;&gt; How do you know? One of the doctors that was examining my lungs with cancer now said, "If your lungs wasn't so perfect, you'd have never survived this." &gt;&gt; I didn't go back and tell him about a night in North Carolina, but I sat there and thought, if God hadn't performed that miracle, &gt;&gt; he couldn't perform this miracle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about your miracle, brother Ron? My life is in chaos. Let me just say there's one in this building. Hallelujah. I have new men in financial difficulties, horrible financial difficulties. When God came into their life, he changed their lives. &gt;&gt; Listen, God's a banker. &gt;&gt; It's not a God's a banker. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And take this correctly. There's people that have went to all kind of psychologists. This word is a is a psychologist. &gt;&gt; He knows how to take your anxiety and bring you to a peace. &gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of times we're at war within ourselves. Let that war. &gt;&gt; Let that war bring you to a peace. Let the war dissolve and let it go somewhere else. live in peace. &gt;&gt; I think that's a phenomenal statement that you can live in peace. &gt;&gt; Your family can live in peace. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? My wife said something to me yesterday. You didn't think I was going to use it? She said, "I'm ever amazed." We were having dinner. She said, "I'm ever amazed. We got We got children. We got daughter-in-laws. We got grandchildren." And she said, "I've never had a falling out with them. Never had a fall." Listen, when you're at peace, &gt;&gt; you don't have to have fallings out. You can have differences. &gt;&gt; What kind of differences? Chocolate and vanilla. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But if you mix them both together, it comes out real good. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm on such and such diet. Listen, if you you'll find something on the table. But listen, our homes can be at peace. &gt;&gt; Our jobs, &gt;&gt; but brother Ron, I live with a bunch of buzzards. I I I I have to work with buzzards. Be an eagle. &gt;&gt; And an eagle is an eagle no matter where it's at. &gt;&gt; Rise above your storms. We celebrate anniversaries and birthdays. I know you do. I get your notices. Come to my birthday party. That's That's good. Don't be mad at me if I don't. But please don't be mad at me if I don't. And I'm glad you're celebrating and you got another one. you're not dead. Or I'd have done preached your funeral. I'd have tried to find something good to say. If you work long enough, you'll find something. Where was I at, Matthew? No, I was somewhere before that. I worked at the Arsenal for 11 years in nitroglycerin. This is where I was going. When I arrived, we worked in nitroglycerin. You know what they do? Nitroglycerin blows up. Takes people's lives. When I arrived, they were some of the biggest cussers that I'd ever met. I don't do that. There was there was pictures in every locker that I don't look at. They had religion that didn't live. I didn't go in preaching. I went in living. Before I was gone, there were times when there was nothing to do. They would say, "Preach." And I jump up on a table that was about that tall. Somebody help me. I jump up on that table. It was a long table. And I would stand there and preach to them this gospel. &gt;&gt; Listen. Then got word to the headquarters. And they came to hear me preach. We never started a shift without prayer. &gt;&gt; Where did it start? Living a sermon. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Many times I got out and and we would get alone cuz there was 7,500 buildings. And listen, I would meet them and they say, "Preacher, I need you to pray with me." got down on my knees and prayed with them. Over 60 people came to my father's church while I was there. I would invite them to come. Over 60 came. This message can be lived. Don't tell me it can't. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? When I left, it was like a death that was happening that I was leaving. One of my bosses said, "Who's going to live it now?" That man would later commit suicide. Who's going to live it now? And I told him, "You can." &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, my world is in chaos. &gt;&gt; Then let it be changed by the power of God. Brother Chris, you own your own business. You've owned it for years. You don't have time to preach people a sermon. But you can live it. You can live it. Some of these guys work here for you. You can live a sermon. Listen, it don't take long to be around you to know you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; I can say that about you. you you're a Christian. Listen, and you don't have to say anything. &gt;&gt; It's because the chaos in your life now has been brought to order. &gt;&gt; Don't tell me there wasn't chaos at one time, cuz there was. Listen. And God brings that to order. &gt;&gt; And now others can share the benefits. Here you sit on the front pew. I'm glad to see that. I'm glad to see that. A few years ago, you didn't know nothing about this. Ain't it, right? But now, God is day by day bringing your life to order. Are you with me? There's a lot of benefits that goes with this. Ain't that right? And you don't just feel it on Sunday, but Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday, it lives in your life. Will I fail? Sure, you'll fail. But there's a God that'll lift you back up. &gt;&gt; He'll lift you back up. He'll draw strength to you. Sisters, the world's got all kind of stuff that they call fashion &gt;&gt; that I wouldn't I wouldn't want you to be caught dead in. &gt;&gt; But God has you as a as a witness &gt;&gt; of the order of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to worry about your future. God's got it in control. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I'm so worried about my job and I'm worried about this and I'm worried about that in my life. I'm worried about a mate. Let me just say, if you put God first in your life, &gt;&gt; he'll take care of everything. Don't you love him? Won't you love him with all your hearts? He's good to us, isn't he?
