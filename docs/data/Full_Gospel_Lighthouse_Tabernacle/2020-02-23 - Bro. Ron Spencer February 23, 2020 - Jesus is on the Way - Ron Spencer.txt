TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a man he's faithful led me a man you can be seated just a moment if you would like certainly good to be in the house of the Lord in it a man we never want to take it for granted that we're here so good to see you so good to see brother Brian and his wife with us tonight amen good to have you in the house of the Lord this afternoon thank you for that amen amen I want to continue to remember sister Judy's family as well she lost her brother and the funeral was this week and and God just touched her ain't man and so thank you for your prayers and everything that you have done for us and last night my heart was just bursting last night as I as I went toward the end of the service and I was getting ready to leave and and Seth walked up to me and he had a car before me and in the car he had a he had a gift wanted me to buy a dinner and so I surely that little boy didn't do that and so I wrote his daddy last night and when he told me I I just have to tell you I just busted my water valves all busted last night and so and so Seth god bless you guys we love you with all of our hearts amen it has let us know that we're loved in a lot of places and so we just are so thankful for that and we're believing for a good report and we just believe in God we'll do some supernatural works and so we just thank the Lord for that and we never knew that we were gonna had to walk this road and these are some surprises sometimes but God's not ever taken off off surprise and so he's never in a crisis he doesn't call the Angels together and say now now we got out reassemble some things here he has armed us for this battle amen so so appreciate last night brother brother Wiggum I just I was just I was just proud of that so I was just thankful brother William a man to your family and we're just praying I think we're going to dedicate a baby next weekend if they're able and so we're looking forward to that and now they're officially in Virginia so amen a lot of things that was said last night was very key and very important and I hope you grab both of it amen I'd like for you to do a little homework this week if you can do this and for those that have internet availability to do it brother Tim this morning kind of rehearsed the last chapter of the book of Acts of his visit here with us and and he took about 15 20 minutes this morning just to kind of go over some things whether you realize I'm not was quite a supernatural time that was that we took place here and as he spoke last weekend I was I was very much tortured you know we can have every promise in the Bible and every song and everything but until that little thing happens in your life there's a bit of fear and darkness that goes with cancer and so on and I mean I could I've seen some in phenomenal miracles and and that just little thing was haunting it it seemed like every morning was a teary mourning and a cry morning and it was just it was just that kind of an atmosphere that was haunting at me after that prayer when brother Donnie broke into tongues and I heard that I heard I heard brother Tim praying that my immune system would just pick and drive that cancer out brother random said healings in the body and then toward the end as he came to the end and brother Donny is interceding and in that heavenly language I I just like to say this to you that spirit of torment left in that long [Applause] and I'd like to say that there's nobody can bring peace like Jesus can bring peace and so brother Tim just shared this morning he had a dream while he was with us and it was after the Sunday night service and brother Tim has some God deals with him in the three different kinds of directions but he dealt with him in a dream while he was at our house and he related to us on the way to the he also had another experience but but he relayed to us the dream on the way to the to the doctors as his appointment would be to fly out it was late enough to where I can take brother Tim with me in to see the the cancer doctor and I thought that was a really good touch God's always perfect and so I I just I just told him I had my family with them had brother Nathaniel Holmes go with me because I needed him to interpret what they would say and so you know just just speak in laymen terms I'm a country boy I just need to hear it right face-to-face and so and so brother Joe Greene had been with me on Bop season and then we went in to see the doctor and and she's just an incredible doctor and and so brother till on the way there relate us a dream that was that was he was in this dream and he was there was just about 12 buzzers they were they were they couldn't fly they seemed like they just got out of their nest and and he was gathering them one by one and was feeding them to pigs and he began to talk about the gory site of the intros and all that he saw take place and those pigs was eaten those buzzards son and so he was feverishly looking looking on the on the message of what what pigs have to do with buzzards and and and and as it would be those buzzards represent those demons of cancer and so what he had prayed into prayer on Thursday evening he had prayed for our immunise immunity to our immune system to kick in and so as we sat and listened to the doctor and she you know she shared with us and that she said you have some options you can do nothing and and for those that don't know if you could do nothing you've just got months to live where I'm sitting and so for the people that are critics of me going to a doctor well I really want to live till the summer you understand what I'm saying and I've had critics of me going to the doctor but brother Brandon went to the doctor brother branham took medicine so I you know and by the way all the miracles that happened since I was raised back to life and I was in a coma for for a month all of those miracles happen because of good doctors that kept me alive until God would work a miracle and so I was sitting before this doctor and brother Branham taught us that if you go to the doctor he said do what they say and then take the medicine that they give you and so we know God's the healer he gave them the knowledge and God's the healer you don't go for them to healing God's the only one that does the healing and so and so she relayed to us said there's a few different options that you could take there's of course radiation and then there's chemotherapy and then there's a couple of more different things and and she said but what my recommendation for you is immunotherapy and it would be to supercharge your your immune system to where it would attack the cancer brother Tim just with that but that smile this is what we were looking for so the pigs are going to eat the buzzards one treatment at a time that's what [Applause] a man him by the way they came up with that with was studying the actually study in pigs and so using the cancer and in a pig sale so I I just think that's just all so neat and maybe I didn't explain that real good but I think I think if we could just step back just for a moment God has great big plans and I think it's way beyond ourselves our church because we're coming toward a resurrection if we can't have faith to overcome cancer how can we have faith for a rapture or faith for a resurrection for the people that have been in the ground not just a few days or not just a few months or a few years and Connie's very faithful to do to go to their brother homers grave and my mother's grave and put flowers on the grave and I've always admired that about her as a seasons changed she puts flowers that represent the season but there's coming a time where we won't have to put no more flowers there's coming a resurrection because we have a promise a man so brother Tim related that any if you want to listen to the book of Acts this morning I would recommend you go and listen to it it's it's just really really good and so a man I we we certainly enjoyed having brother Tim and brother Donnie and I'm sure a lot of others would love to come but you know I had I just I just pray that they give me just a little bit of space and so amen it's gonna be a little bit of a deal at home a little bit of as we go through through some therapy not everything's delicate so amen so love that I love soul of the men of God brother farmer sister Deborah's father sent me a note this weekend and he and and I thought this was so appropriate he said long years before that they had smelters they used to take gold and how they would know how it was right or not with all the sludge that was out of it and all the iron pyrite that's that's fool's gold and all the fools out of it and and and the beaters would beat it and beat it and turn it and beat it and and turned it until the the beater sees the reflection his reflection in the gold he said that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial after trial and test after test and trial after trial and test after test until the life of Christ is reflected in your life until you become peaceful and sobered me and gentle and humble ready submissive willing to turn your head from the things of the world looking straight to Calvary to the one who's doing the beating many times you think it's strange because of firing the the because of the fiery trials and sick persecutions it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you to get the slides out of you to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to the place where you can look and see the reflection or men can see the reflection of Christ in you a man the hope of glory amen god bless you I just have one more I'd like for you to be praying for brother Tom Murray brother Tom is as many of you know has has had his ankle replaced a couple of different times and this time they were getting ready to replace that apparatus again because he was having some difficulty or was going to shave the bone again and so literally God worked to miracle right before the doctor stopped and didn't do it and when he went back and x-rayed it literally the operating room was ready and they were getting ready to take him in and and brother Tom just told him where the pain was and Annie baby an attack pain was higher the boom was actually fractured and so had they did the surgery went on and did the surgery he would have wound up an amputee but we want to pray we want to pray that God would come on the scene for brother Tom Murray he's a he's a friend of ours and and we're just praying that God would just brother Andrew was just with him I was just with him just only a few days ago and we we just want to pray that God would work a special miracle are you with me God work a special miracle that God would just come on the scene and give him give them the wisdom to know how to handle that entire situation to were that they can fix that ture never have another problem I believe God is able I believe he's absolutely able to don't you a man would you stand with me tonight I just want to I just want to share some scripture with you this evening amen god bless you for being here this evening for me thank you for your patience with me for just a bit to share some things on my heart I'd like to speak tonight on Jesus is on his way and there's nothing the devil can do to stop him I like that don't you that should make us believers just grant Matthew chapter 14 verse 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side and while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into the mountain apart to pray and and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went into the unto them walking on the sea quite a quite words right they're walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is it a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me to come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink and he cried saying lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and saturdayman o thou of little faith wherefore did a stout doubt and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased and then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him and saying of a truth thou art the son of God could we just pray maybe you have a need tonight you just like to say Lord remember me this evening a man god bless you Almighty God we bow our heads before you even now aware of your presence in a special way this evening now Lord we just ask you that you would be mindful of his Lord and come and speak to our hearts father this afternoon we so love a bride of Jesus Christ and Lord we love you with all of our hearts tonight Lord we ask you now that you would come and speak to us in a supernatural way Lord our hands lifted we we literally defied gravity and we lifted before you not before a man but before you knowing that you're able to meet every one of our needs father some needs we can't even speak out but father you know every one of our needs now maybe stretch forth your hand toward us tonight father save us to not minister to us to not father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen you can be seated you can listen to the prophet in several different sermons he begins to describe this situation she begins to describe it in one particular place he said they'd left the campaign he said they'd seen a lot an incredible amount of things that Jesus was doing he sent them out he said that's the way the church world has done they they went off without Jesus especially in the last time that he spoke on this he he describes the church that it's went off without Jesus and let me just say we'll all get in trouble if we move off without Jesus that he has at first place our life the very center focus of our lives to be without Jesus is the worst place that we can ever be in Jesus had stayed back and he was he wanted to be alone send his disciples no doubt that had a phenomenal campaign taking place and they saw incredible miracles happen these disciples were seeing things that no man since the time of Adam had ever seen all the prophets they had they'd saw miracles through through some of those but they'd never seen God operate on this level they'd never seen him as a man operate to word that as the compassion of a man he could take a leopard and that leopard be healed literally within seconds that man would be completely changed turned by the heart of blind Bartimaeus and stopped and and and just and just that man and that had been blind of his life and and brother branham would go into the back story of how he had worshipped and he had he gave his daughter had got sick and he he gave me seeing-eye lamb away here was a man reaching out to God for his only opportunity people would come to the campaign's with that kind of an expectation this service would change my life I think if we came to the building tonight with an expectation god I'm desperate before you if we would come with an expectation there's there's things in our lives and situations and circumstances that we're not in control of that only God could turn it minister to our needs but you see no man can take care of some of those things man can only take you so far he can only make you so many promises but manna breaks his promises if you're around an individual long enough you'll see his humanity he'll disappoint you she'll disappoint you but Jesus will never disappoint you he's never he's never been in a crisis meeting he's never failed God's never failed one time he's never backed up on his promises not one little iota these men knew that they were in a special spot being with him you see they were I was not watching God operate as they leave them no doubt the the side of the banks and they're getting ready to make their trip across the terrain would be that storms can rise up in that area and an incredibly fast patch fast way in and in that situation you can get in trouble real quickly one brother told me that was in South America one time when I was in Trinidad he told me he said that that he said that he was a boatman and he said those waves can get so high so quickly and he said if you're not a boatman and don't know how to take care of it though those waves can be so intimidating well these disciples is now pitched out in and they're there floating along and they're making a way across and brother BAM would describe how that they would be rowing as they're going across and making their way across the sea and he said after a while he said it starts the sun's you know kind of in a certain spot and he says one by one like popcorn they began to stand up and testify testify have the things that they saw God do we could do that tonight stand up all over this building miracle after miracle after miracle we've seen God dude we're living in the book of Acts and we've seen what God has done and what he's done in our lives and ministered to us we've we've watched him operate we've watched him work and we know that no man can do those things they stood up Andrew would stand and Matthew would stand and Luke would stand and Peter would stand and they would begin to give testimonies you know when you start stirring the spirit of the Lord there's an anointing starts coming lesson that mysterion's to get charged you just start talking about Jesus whether you're on the job or in your living room you just start talking about Jesus and it begins to swoop on the atmosphere it'll start coming in the building in a pub where you're at hallelujah they just started talking about the Lord things begin to happen you see their lives have been changed they'd never seen no man do what what God was doing realizing they were in very special times their moms and dads no doubt talked about once coming that's going to do these things in the prophecies and all of that but never have we seen it quite on this order and they're just kind of sharing that backwards and forwards I think sometimes we if we're not careful we'll forget to share that with our children are you with me this is greater than Walt Disney this is greater than anything let your children know a supernatural God and let them hear about the stories of God working in your family and working in your church and working in your life not a dead letter not some sophisticated gospel where God don't work anymore you see whenever it becomes intellectualism or just theory or historical stories it begins to die and a lot of times there's a lot of death in churches where God's not alive where God's not working but I want him here I want him working in every service as they as they were now coming toward evening now it's beginning to get dark you know there's where all our trouble starts as we come into that dark time of our life it's the time that we're we're kind of coming now darkness brings on a lot of things starts to get dark you know and now the waves start to get a little bit rough Satan gets into details you ever had Satan get in the details of your life and you just know that something's going on here there's there's something at work here that's just that's just not right you can just kind of feel there's a there's maybe an edginess in the room or a or a friction that's there that what they're before and a spirit it's moving and and before long that spirit I'll stop trying to hurt your family or hurt your marriage or hurt your relationship with God called you to be mad at God when that's the last one you should be mad at understand God don't make you sick are you into God don't make the trials on it's an enemy that does that are you with me now don't blame it on God God don't do that he's there to help you in your trials in your sickness he's there to watch over your life because God said I am the lord that healeth thee and he's in the hallways and I am God and God always cares about you you're important to him I'm a nobody let me just say everybody is somebody in the kingdom of God as he's waves beginning to come these men are these men our boatman these a man understand what a storm is you know sometimes as Christians we don't expect storms let me just share something personal to you my wife and myself was standing before Christmas about about about the time of brother Danny's demon being and and brother Kelly had just been here but the Danny and the coin had been given to us and then brother Danny comes and I went back and looked at his services as even some of the notes on these services this morning and just actually right on spot on and I was standing I was standing in the living room with Connie and we were just standing there and I was talking to her and I said you know life's just perfect it's just perfect where you know now we're getting a little I'm getting a little gray in my hair I'm not working as hard as I used to have to work I'm enjoying the company of our family enjoying our grandkids you know the church is doing good you know and God's just so good to us life's just perfect you see as a man you can't see the storm but it's God he's watching for it he's already supplied the need before you ever get to it and thus things begin to roll very quickly you were hearing you were hearing them you were hearing the news week after week after week it's things begin to come in God knew that glut knew that God was aware of that so the Jeff and sister Anna give me a picture and it was Jesus walking on the water I'd been after that picture a long time from there here's where I'm preaching tonight this has been on my heart for some time let me just say this view Jesus knew where those disciples were he was aware of their situation now they had watched him blessed the fish and the loaves they had watched a man bless literally the chemicals of biscuits and blessed fish and those cooked fish duplicated cooked fish and that flower and the elements of that biscuits duplicated and was biscuits for over 5,000 people here with me it's the same God that took care of the children in the wilderness sometimes we think oh I've got to do this listen God's able to take care of us he's absolutely able to take care of us in every need in every situation I've seen a lot of things but I've never seen a man walk on water other than ice they'd seemed that duplication they had seen they had seen hands come straight palsy straighten up it seemed a dead race but they'd never seen this kind of phenomenon find it interesting that right in the midst of our trials Satan likes to tell you how big he is he likes to stack the odds against you he likes to tell you how dark your trial is and he always wants to give you the bad news and how do we look at the worst-case scenarios so quickly in our minds I many times even as a believer you're not exempt because the greatest battle that's ever fought is in your mind and in your mind Satan meets you there but you're armed with the Word of God to take God's Word and write out checks and speak the Word of God and not just speak but believe it so us and so as those disciples are there just as Satan tried to block the visitation of Abraham and Sarah with Melchizedek you remember in the in the in the sermon brother branham said in is there anything too hard for the Lord he said that morning Sarah got up and she was in a fussy mood never happens at none of our homes but she was in a fussy mood now now she was as much a part of the promises Abraham was and that morning she got up in a fussy mood and and she was barking and she was talking about you know the caravans you know they go by Lots misses Lots house and she's got a new head she's got a new dress they don't never come up here and and she was just going on and on brother branham said it was Satan trying to block the visitation come on church how many times do we come to church and coming down the road now I'm on the spot now coming down the road a little Barclays goes on a little bark it goes on and in the little bark II it causes an atmosphere on you and your seat and your mind is way off somewhere else and there's a visitation happening in the church and one person is literally almost in rapture and condition and the other one's got they're missing the whole thing because Satan blocked what God was doing help me preach now brother Rena would say it don't miss this don't miss it don't miss it don't miss it come on Church find it interesting how that he gets into details and here men that was in a testimony service just a little bit ago now it's fearful Jesus come walking now sometimes people put some bad shadow on Peter because he sank but to me he was a hero cuz he's the only one in that boat that said Lord bid me to come I believe your God and I want a walk with you when you said be not afraid i I want to do more than just listen to the message I want to live it bid me to walk with you a little bit if you can walk on water so can i if the message lives so can I live hallelujah if the token works I want it applied in my life I want to be an overcomer in Laodicea you step out of the boat and he started walking and then he's walking the waves came up and he lost focus on Jesus don't tell me don't criticize Peter for a moment because many times you have to be kind of sit back up sometimes you lose your focus sometimes you need to be balanced a little bit I'm preaching to you because I've been your pastor a long time I've had to put a safety belt on some of you get you back are you in the hell life real sometimes it's real sometimes Satan tries to shake you and you remember Jesus told Peter Satan's ambition was to sift him like wheat ground into powder destroy him but remember what Jesus told him I prayed for you I prayed for you that thy faith when thou I converted strengthen the Brethren when I live on the inside of you you'll live by yourself you can't stand up oh brother I don't want to be a Christian I want to walk I want to be a real church member I want to be a sister in the kingdom of God until you get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you ask forgiveness of your sins and then you're filled with the Holy Ghost the very life of God then you can stand some cast [Applause] kind of reminds me of some young whippersnappers never been through a battle they can quote a lot of Scripture say a lot of things actually talk down to people sometimes be difficult they never been do nothing but give me that that time-tested memorial give me the guy that's been tried by fire a lot of times wind blows if you're not time-tested you don't break it right off when they would pick a picker a pole to go in a ship they would get the tree with the most powerful grains in it that could stand the storm I don't want a wheat God forgive me let me just speak honest with you tonight I don't want a weak God in this kind of a storm you can't look at the trial that lays in front of me and what a weak God some people feel like they're gonna quit with the TOEIC somebody didn't shake their hand little petty thing comes along and blows them right out of the water little situation comes up and they just blow up brother brems said they haven't been pressurized right major difference between the Blackbird and an eagle even the hawk will fly so high but he's not pressurized to go but that Eagles born to where he can go up into the midst of the storm and then set his eyes towards the Sun and just keep going and ride above the storm remember one time God having a conversation with a man named Joe he'd been kind of you know could be an example for all of us sometimes we think we've had bad days we'll just read the book of Job just a little bit and it kind of lets you know that it could be worse he had friends come to him and say you must have sinned you must have sinned you must have done something wrong in your life for you to have to go through that I've had a couple of jobs comforters come to me already but I know where I'm standing I got no problems at the river you remember when God came to him God didn't even talk to him about his trouble he didn't even talk to him about his situation God didn't tell him talk to him about his balls or even sat down to have a pity party with him you know sometimes we want to if we could just have an interview with God we'd like to tell him everything it's been going on bad god I'd like to tell you all my problems and all my situations I'd like to just God you know you need to know this but when God came to job he didn't talk about none of his problems I love this part when God came to job he asked him where was you act where was you act when I laid the foundations of the earth where was you at when I created the mountains in the and the deserts in and he just kind of took him through all that he did and he showed him everything that he had done and he brought him into an eternal room oh if we could look tonight past that storm and into an eternal room hallelujah you would sign a double term for your trowel if you just knew how much that got out of you to give even Satan permission have you considered joke you see your trials molds you and everyone situation that I'm in or Satan thinks he has me in let's say it like that when it's mentioned to somebody automatically they relate to one of their family members it's had it this and that but every situation is different err every every every circumstance is different you will go through trials that I'll never go through are you with me we need one another you can't stand by yourself you need one another I'm preaching even down to the unseen audience we need you we want to be a blessing to you we want to be a strength to you and I want you to know this we are never alone brother branham said many times you might think my friend you might you might have went off without him but remember he's still watching you he knows right were you all they may be a trouble in the home maybe trouble in your soul maybe trouble in your body whatever it is don't you worry he has got his eyes on you he is watching you it climbed up on the top of a mountain he was looking out there and he seen every trick that the devil was playing and he not only climb but he climbed the ramparts of Calvary not only did Calvary - the ramparts of glory and he sits tonight at the Majesty he looks down on the earth and there's not even a ripple that can come on the water without his permission that's quite a thought in there isn't a ripple that could come on the water without his permission the sea can't move a leaf can't move a bird can't fly blessed be the name of the Lord he is above all principalities and powers the earth made made by him made him the lowest name that could be brought God gave him the hause name that could be given the earth put him as low as they could get him and in the sin and grave but God raised him on the highest of high he is so high till he has to look down to see heaven his eyes on the sparrow I know he watches me he watches you he knows every thought that's in your mind he knows every action that you make he knows everything about you the trut you say uh but I back slave brother branham that don't make a bit of difference he knows exactly what you back slid over he knows exactly where you're at he's a brother Brown and I went off without him - I had an opportunity one time to speak I had an opportunity one time to be a Christian I had an opportunity the preacher made a call I ought to him when I tried it once but I failed I did this and that no matter what you've done he still has his all over you boy you talk about grease those disciples went off without him and the darkest hour when the devil kid got them away from there away from his presage he began to store him on them maybe that's what he's doing to you tonight he might give you cancer he might give you this he might give you that he might give you a broken home he might give you tore apart he might have give you worries you might have give you a headache I don't know what he'll do but there's one thing that I do know that God has still got his eye on you this may be your darkest hour I don't know God does but just in the darkest time that he said when they were just about ready to go down then Jesus came walking in your darkest hour Jesus comes walking you know to me this message has been worth living I have no regrets I have absolutely no regrets when it comes to serving God I look back at a lot of times that I the man have disappointed him he's never disappointed me brother on the process you know so many times we're looking for a miracle to happen you know we all want it to just happen just like that you see I've been through some trials before you remember I fell off of a house and landed on concrete fell 40 feet landed on concrete the doctors later would have some difficult news for me that I'd never walk again but God rich in His mercy but you see it took me about a year to recover I'd had back spasms for about a year chiropractors have told me ever since then they could see the cracks in the back you've had a bad injury one time and I tell them the story and they'd always be marbled at that but you see it was a process of healing that had to go through you know we want an instant thing we want it to be so instant that just in a moment my problem is is over and we want God to move on the scene right now as you know you watched after the fire it was it was about six months even to a year that my lungs would be restored supernaturally in a meeting I was sitting in the meeting just like you are tonight God rich in His mercy reached down supernaturally and I felt the full vacuum of power come into my lungs God gave me new lungs that's even strong tonight for me to preach with this situation are you with me just they told me the other day said your lungs are strong I didn't take the time didn't have the time to tell them God gave me new lungs but there's a squatter that's came into my lungs it's a devil he's on God's property before I get too weary here I just want to share a couple things that's on my heart there was a time that as a sinner sin raised in my life but God rich in mercy with the blood of Jesus Christ that man died and a new king came into my heart now the same blood that paid for my Redemption also was beat being at college judgement Hall that I could be healed it was a dual atonement or you even out once I got saved there's no turning back but if you get sick and God heals you you live long enough you'll get sick again but there's no sickness God can't take care of [Applause] mr. devil I want to tell you you have no legal authority to hold me as a captive and I'm sure the other third-last thirsty he was very disappointed when his torment spirit didn't work no more when that wave came in the next morning tried to grab ahold of me I just looked at him I said not today devil not today what about your problem what about your anxiety what about your depression looking right square in the eyes as I held on you don't live here no more I'm not an adulterer no more I'm not a fornicator no more I'm gonna drug taker no more I'm a child of the king [Applause] brother branham said one time he got in the car and the devil got in the car he said he got in the car with him and he said since you got in the car I'm just gonna sing to you and he said I just sing to him all the way so if he's gonna ride with you if he's gonna try to live with you just put him in torment [Applause] I'm not doing a lot of reading because my eyes are blurred but let me just say this to you if he's going to try to live in this body I'm gonna put this word right in front of him Paulo that I can I'm listening to all the sermons that I can I'm praying all I can if he's gonna rock if he wants to play rodeo he has came to a really bad house jesus said I am the resurrection in the love are you with me he had the keys of death Helmand the grief that Jesus lives inside of me that Jesus lives inside of you I'm just gonna give you a couple principles thoughts just before I quit the scripture said greater is He that is in you greater is He that's in you brother Branham said two overcoming is to recognize the devil at his trick now let me just say he's a real magician he can camouflage his activity but once you recognize him what's your recognize him there's power inside of you to kick him off brother Branham said as Christians we have a right to enforce our god-given rocks to bring it back to its original order now you might think this is crazy but I just booked the meeting just before I walked out of here brother wrong don't you realize what you're getting ready to go through got a good idea I am the man in the arena but there's going to be life after this [Applause] one more statement if I can give it to you you're welcome to stand and musicians can come where they put Daniel nobody had ever came out nobody had ever lived through that experience it was automatic death where they put Daniel but Daniel happened to have God on his side and you know what come morning Daniel walk out of that cage and if Jesus walked out of that - I'm walking - now this might be crazy to the entire world but last Thursday I got healed [Applause] last Thursday akka heels cost the spirit of that thing my champion walked in the room hallelujah hallelujah my champion that took ever strap in every organ was exposed much helping with the culprit that's my champion when he stepped in the room my precious friends were there but he's the one makes a difference I look through the storm and so Jesus when you see Jesus makes all the difference in the world I hope you saw him tonight god bless you this evening I
