we get started here and appreciate the musicians amen give the musicians a round of applause Round of Applause you don't know how much it is to not having a musician amen they mean a lot to you amen amen just uh read a few quotes before we get started brother man would say this says you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight I don't know that does something to my expectation if God would put things in motion many generations back so I could be here tonight then I'm going to be expecting something good because if he would plan many generations back for this very moment then there's something good about to happen brother man would also tell us say you enter into the house of God you're going to leave one way or the other it's what he said I mean just what he said I like what he said amen but the Bible says this in Matthew 18: 19 again I say unto you that two shall agree on Earth touching anything as they ask it shall be done in them with the father in Heaven let's agree today we're going to leave better than what we came in you in agreeance with me by the confession we're going to leave better than what we come in amen amen he goes where he invited let's just invite him today and as we have our Bibles let's turn to Genesis chap CH 18 and we're going to go to Ephesians chapter 2 Genesis Chapter 18 and Ephesians chapter 2 sure good to be here Genesis Chapter 18 we're to pick up one verse there verse 14 I love this scripture is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I'll return unto thee according to the time of thy life and sherah shall have a son Ephesians chapter 2 if you turn with me there we'll start reading verse 11 wherefore remember that ye being in times past Gentiles In the Flesh you're called uncircumcision by that which is called circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that day you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world but now how many say but now but now in Christ you were sometimes were're far off made nigh by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who has made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in the ordinances for to make of himself of Twain one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the imity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were a far off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth un a holy Temple in the Lord and ye in whom ye also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit amen you may have your seats and I got to get comfortable that's the least amount of clothes I wear there know why they give you a suit coat I don't like it amen I don't know about you I don't like working with a with a coat on I like to be free I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ likes to be free amen you know if I might by the help of the Lord just want to take a thought of walls walls you know right here Jesus came and what was his purpose he came to break there was a wall there was a wall between you and him Adam had built that wall there and by the Fall there was a wall that we couldn't have the type of Fellowship that God wanted us to have amen he wanted that Fellowship it was a very type of Adam as Adam would go down through there and he would look at every animal what was he looking for he was looking for somebody that Adam himself could have fellowship with what was he showing God was showing that this is who I am and there's somebody I am longing to have that type of Fellowship I love my wife nobody can replace my wife that is my very part of me and God wants fellowship with his bride like that amen he doesn't want any walls between you and that Fellowship he doesn't want any walls between you in that Fellowship he proved it because he left all of heaven and he came down and stepped up to a cross now listen he did not complain when he went to that cross he did not whine about it he did not say I wish it wouldn't happen he didn't complain about it why because he wanted to let you know how much he wants that fellowship and how much he loves you he loves you tonight I know the devil's beat you down all week but that's all right we're having church tonight it's time for walls to come down it's time for things to listen he doesn't want you to have that Fellowship the devil does not want you to have that kind of Fellowship but I've been into the house of God tonight and I've not come here to lose I've come to win I've come to fight I've come to take hold of what God gave me let's get back into that CU listen God is instilled that Fellowship he loved to come down in the Seal of the evening he still loves to come down in the Seal of the evening at the Midnight Hour Oh Glory he wants Fellowship today listen he just wants somebody that will hold their hand Brothers how many loves to hold your wife's hand all right you older brothers how many brothers love to hold your wife's hand still well sisters you reach over and punch them you know God just wants somebody to walk with him come on don't make it hard he wants somebody that will walk with him how do you know that brother mat when he was in the Garden of Eden he just want somebody to walk with he wants somebody to talk with he wants somebody to be his very mate he wants somebody to say Lord I want that kind of Fellowship I don't want it under a man's idea I don't want it under this I want the fullness of God and in this hour we have the fullness of God that we can have the True [Applause] Fellowship amen he's here tonight he's here tonight not only did I bring him with him he came to tear down walls he cameist he came to tear down walls listen he don't want any any of the devil to build any kind of wall between you and him and the devil is Sly he will do it slowly he will do it over time he will take his time to try to take the fellowship that God wants to have with you but I'm here to say tonight Satan you're an absolute liar and I don't like you I don't like him I know he came tonight so I might as well tell him I don't like you Satan you lying slewfoot Stealer how many Longs for Fellowship brother Brandon would say this he said God Longs for Fellowship he yearns he wants people to speak with him to talk with him listen y young people he wants you to speak to him how do I speak to him brother mat real simple I'm a simple type of guy just talk to him like you talk to your dad yes he's God but he he's a friend how many loves a good friend one that you can say brother I need prayer and you know he ain't going to tell anybody around your back well Glory come on saints of God that's how a brother and sister should be when a brother comes to you in confidence it a't for you to go running tell it's for you to pray with them it's for you to break through for them if they can't break through then God brought them to you to help them pray through come on we need one another this ain't this guy against this guy and this church against this church this is a bride body going in action so get your little feelings of who you are they're nothing listen stick your finger in the water you know where I'm coming from it's about time we get back to that humble before God and he will lift you up brother remember say this he says he wants you to he wants people to speak to him to talk to him you might be one thing you might sing too much you might preach too much glory Lord have mercy sometime but there's one thing you'll never be able to DOD Doo overdo that's pray the Bible said I would all men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands he said you'll never be able to have too much fellowship with God and God Longs think about that I know the thoughts with me does he know me yeah he knows you in fact he knew you from the foundation of the world and it ain't stopped him yet man let that sink in for just a minute he knows all about you and he's still coming out who knocks at your heart in the morning who comes before you who won't leave you alone it's God God because he loves you would you love to have lived in that time and Great Fellowship God had with Adam and Eve in the garden to come down in the cool of the evening and talk with them and fellowship with them wouldn't that be marvelous we all would I can prove to you that he that we can come right back on those terms again with God right straight back in that kind of Fellowship I don't know about you I believe in that type of Fellowship I believe in a garden listen I'm not talking in the natural cuz we ain't living we're Liv Satan but there's a people that have entered into the holiest of holies with their God and they've come into perfect peace they've come into a place of perfect love they've come into Fellowship not just with another man but the man Christ Jesus and he begins to tell them he begins to talk to them he begins to show them the word and they begin to Fellowship around it I believe he wants to bless you tonight well how many wants a blessing yeah that's good we all should want a blessing amen I was telling brother Andrew about this I you know I I'm not an AI proponent but you know brother man makes the statement he said if you take the whole water of the earth and put it in a for foot pipe he said if you do it that's how and and blog it up that pressure behind there trying to leak through through every crevice that's how much God wants to bless you so I'm I'm a dummy but I said AI what is all the water of the Earth in a 4-ft pipe what's the calculation of pressure and it whoa I'm not that smart and I said Lord and so I grabb that I said now what would that do to a human body and it basically would obliterate it I mean it Crush bones It Crush everything but there's a people that's pressurized there's a people that's pressurized that can handle the fullness of God because all that he was he poured into Jesus but all that he is he's pouring into the Bride of Jesus Christ Lord I want that kind of blessing maybe you need Deliverance tonight maybe you've been in a battle all week long but maybe this is your moment of taking a deep breath and a Time refreshing in the presence of God Almighty then why don't you ask for that kind of blessing don't sit back and say Lord well give it to you why don't you say Lord I want that kind of blessing well praise the Lord listen Satan doesn't want you to have this type of Fellowship how many has battles for Lord battle all day long right why because Satan does not want you to have that type of Fellowship because he knows if God's people go to fellowship with God man I tell you what Supernatural things begin to happen they begin to speak in tongues they begin to have power over me they begin to rebuke me and I've got to leave they begin to recognize who they are so if I can block them before they ever get to that kind of Fellowship you want to know why you had such a fight to get here today because there's a blessing in store for you and Satan's trying to block it but I'm here to tell you Satan you ain't got enough we're already here we're already here you tried to block me you give me every problem this week but I'm here let's have church come on somebody let's have church tonight let's tear the walls off of every unbelief every sin every fear every sickness everything that's treding to hold you back

things so that you'll learn things and give you a Ministry so you can help somebody else you got a pastor standing behind his Pulpit going through the hardest battle in his life but you know how many lives that has touched and I wouldn't wish had on brother wron in any way shape or form I pray I know it's going to leave amen let's believe with all our heart the word of God is true B you're coming down trying to Brock him from being free taking a deep breath thinking a clear thought you're coming [Applause] down brother Matt you're crazy no I'm speaking with the word of God behind me I am the Lord thy God that Health all of your diseases and we'll stand and fight right [Applause] there you know I was uh had a wall in my life just be honest with you I had a wall in my life I this wall was you've done something wrong for three years I sat with this wall I know what I'm talking about and you seem like you getting fire and then all a sudden you can't go that far so I'm studying to preach for a message and this is on me you pray for the minister sometimes they're going through the hardest battle and they're sitting back there going oh lord I can't do this oh lord I can't do this oh God think about the hardest battle you ever got and then to think be you got to step behind a pull pit and Minister different perspective isn't it that's why we pray brother Andrew never goes through anything come on sister Katie do I need to give you the mic no okay she didn't want the mic she's one oh never mind there's a wall in my life and here I am sitting trying to trying to study it felt like I'd done something wrong just over me just and I prayed I pray Lord if I've done something wrong please show me let me give you a c if God doesn't show you anything nothing's wrong well brother Matt that still doesn't make no so I'm sitting there catch that again if God doesn't show you anything if you ask from a sincere heart let me ask you fathers if your child came to you and asked you for something they really needed it would you just sit there and say wait I'm not going to tell you right now what about you husbands to your wife let's get a little closer she comes to you says honey I just you would do that any true husband would do everything in his power to help his wife so when you ask God the truth and God doesn't say anything you know what the answer is there ain't nothing wrong I'm going to hit that a little bit harder just a minute you know I'm sitting here trying to study for a message you know think about it I got to preach tomorrow I feel like I've done something wrong lord lord lord brother text me right about then aren't you thankful you have friends that feel led of the spirit to text you at the right time and if you feel led don't back down on that you've got something to say to your brother or to your sister and he's trying to get you to reason it away that you're a nobody or nothing but the word that God gave you may be the very word that that person needs give me an example brother Matt when you have an itch do you tell your right hand to itch your left elbow no you do it that's what the body does think about it we are the very body of Jesus Christ if the body has a need over here I don't have to do it no the need begins to go right here and the mind of God tells this part of the body help that part of the body and it happens God wants to work through you don't let anything stop you from God working through you so here I am sitting there brother Brian Crow text me out of the blue hey buddy you need to listen to brother Samuel Browning's message from last week and I'm like well you know what I ain't getting anywhere I might as well so I turn brother Samuel Browning on he begins to preach and he comes to a point there where he's talking about his anything too hard for the Lord and he said Abram and Sarah had a little tiff that morning I said he did so I sh Shamel Browning off and I went to is anything too hard for the Lord where am I sitting at I'm sitting in a place that I thought I'd done something wrong this is where I begin to read you know sometimes when things are going dark you know my nature it's the darkest just before day many times we see disastrous things happening like that especially to Believers we must bear this in mind that Satan is trying to block the blessing that's on the road let's catch this now that was very much so in this case Satan was trying to tempt them to feel they'd done wrong so here I am sitting in my living room in my rocking chair and I thought wait a minute it's Satan trying to and I got mad come on I thought i' sit here and let him rob a blessing from me day after after day after day and when it was revealed to me who it was that was doing it I realized you know what Satan I'm done with you I'm sick and tired of you I'm sick I'm so mad at you I'm going to fight you with everything I got every breath in my body brother man you shouldn't get mad at the Devil brother R said shamgar did he got mad at the Devil why because the devil would come down there and Rob his Blessing year after year after year well why don't we say that's enough I realize who you are you come straight from the pits of and you're lying to me and he's a good liar I felt every bit of it my condemnation temptation but when I recognized it was nothing but a lie I thought Lord I be to cry right there in my living room the spirit of Lord drop I said Lord I'll fight that thing with everything I got and I'm here to tell you if you feel like you've been tempted you've done something wrong and you prayed and you prayed and you prayed and nothing happens let me tell you you ain't done anything wrong that's nothing but a ling devil that's nothing but somebody from the pits of hell trying to rob a blessing well I'm here to tell you tonight you ain't going to limit the power of God any longer devil come on Saints come on little bride so I sat there and I said Lord God give me this message walls and that wall came tumbling down right there it isn't by chance brother Brian Crow text me and brother Samuel said this in his meeting and God said the very thing that I needed to say way back there but listen where did Deliverance come it came right from the message of the hour where are the walls going to come down where are the walls come down in this end time right from the very message of the hour Satan's been after me all day this is Brother brand so I just believe there there's a blessing in store here in the city somewhere I don't know who you are tonight but maybe you felt like Satan's been after you all week this is your night this is your time this is time for that wall to come down this is time for you to go further than you ever thought you could I never thought I'd be standing on this platform tonight but here I am tonight why because I won't let Satan block any more blessings God has for me recognize it's nothing but the devil trying to hold you back brother B said recognize that's the devil trying to hold you back listen he can't stop you but he get in your way and he can try to block you he can try to keep you from the blessing but let your faith rise above tonight and say all things are possible Hallelujah you love him tonight let's talk about Sarah for just a minute think about Sarah first first scripture we read

don't let doubt don't let fear don't let any Temptation brother M you were crazy for letting that bother you come on now I'm I'm human come on break down that wall of Pride well Glory brother Matt Don't Preach go hide behind the pull pit he said Pride he said Pride you know sometimes you need to recognize Lord I need help and not have so much pride to sit behind your crossed arms and sit there but why don't you say Lord I'm opening up tonight Lord you're coming right down my street I've had a block on my life I felt like I haven't went anywhere years but Lord there's a preacher tonight he's come from Indiana I don't even know who he is but Lord you're speaking to my heart and I know it's you in the building it's you coming to let Sarah know the one that's going to bring forth this child the one that's going to bring forth Christ it is you little bride think about Sarah for just a minute I believe she loved Abraham she called him Lord still working on my wife I'm teasing don't Stone

forth child amen you're going to bring forth you're going to bring for so much that she wanted to get Abraham maybe to shut I don't say shut up but she wanted to get she wanted to produce this so she tried to manufacture it she tried to manufacture it hear come here let's get a child please I want this for him it wasn't out of the wrong reason she did it how many's ever tried you want more of Christ and so you're going to do it what happens turns into a mess but the desire is Right catch it now Sarah's desire was not wrong she wanted to please Abraham how many wants to please Christ so there came out him walking down the road I love what Abraham did you know when the presence of God walks into the building make sure you entertain him yeah they want us to be quiet but I tell you what when he comes into the building I want him to know I appreciate him I want him to know I love your presence I'm happy to be in your presence I don't want you to pass by Lord Jesus give me a blessing what can I do for you Lord can I praise you anymore Hallelujah Lord Lord can I stand and just be quiet not everybody's loud now but there are people they'll stand and they'll just weep in the presence of God whatever it is make sure God knows you love him not everybody's got to dance not everybody's got to shout but make sure God knows I Love You Lord ain't no Rock going to S going to sing in my place come on now and nobody can praise him like you can but matter I'm a nobody listen you're here tonight and you're here because the grace of God then why don't you lift your voice and say thank you Lord Sarah had some unbelief Sarah was old oh I just hit a wall right there oh brother Matt don't pick on the old people I'm not I'm here to tell you we need you brother Mt I'm too old no you're not don't you go confessing that you're still here you got something to do you got somebody to bless you got somebody to pray for you can touch Heaven more than anybody you got more wisdom than you realize help these young people come on Church body we need every member well brother Matt I'm just too old well you're at a place to renew your youth [Music] then no excuse come on quit saying that I'm too old God let you get to this age did he not and he still got you here did he not then let's do something with what we got and let's give praise to our Jesus Eternal life's not just living for your anches and pains eternal life is living for others well praise the L well brother Matt you picking on the old people well they should be sure enough to handle it yeah one and only buddy I love you I'm here to tell you that Satan trying to block you from helping somebody else in the church it's nobody else's responsibility if you saw they need help then you go help them God gave you eyes so that you could see the hurting and when they're hurting don't go talk to somebody else about how they're hurting you go talk to them and ask them how can I help you what can I do that doesn't fall on brother Andrew's shoulders all of it no this body works together well preach buddy I believe I will Sarah had it she was dead brother matter I haven't really felt God in the way I used to feel him well you know what we're not of those that go back at how we used to that means there's a better feeling up ahead brother matter I used to be able to do this now come on that your past is hindering your future the wall of your past is trying to keep you from moving forward quit doing that quit looking back at what you used to be and know that moving forward you're going to be better than you ever used to be the best is yet to come there's a body change looking for you and me there's a Rapture looking for you and me there's more of the Holy Ghost for you tonight you don't have to look back to yesterday's years when you were on fire for God there's a fire in the building tonight why don't you step into the fire I'm tearing down some walls tearing down some wall listen you got all kinds of excuses there's no excuse saints of God especially to this bride of Jesus Christ we should be on fire for God and if you're not humble yourself enough to say Lord There's Something Wrong by the way we came to church for the something that's wrong brother B said you come to find your weeks places we come to a hospital and we've already agreed together I'm going to leave better than what I came in but it takes you to say Lord I need help it takes you to say I can't say for I can know you need help I can pray for you but it takes you to say father help me and once you do it the walls begin to come down how many believes that song he was there all the time waiting patiently in line why don't you move him to the front of the why don't you move to the front of the line he deserves that place anyway maybe that's why you got some walls in the first place you got too many well preach brother man I'm an evangelist I just come and go let me go I'm loud I cut and I leave and then the pastor has to fix it come on somebody it's time we quit making excuses for not breaking through walls let's break through some walls tonight be honest with yourself say father it's me standing in the knee of prayer I felt your presence moved Lord and I've wanted it but Lord I I just didn't know what to do well start with lifting your hands and take your hands off of it and surrender it to God and you watch your walls come down Elohim came and Elohim came with a message there's been a message coming the end time and it came to a woman to a specific woman he came and visited Abraham but he deserved the heart of Sarah he deserved the heart of Sarah and he was speaking to Sarah Elohim came to talk to you Elohim wants fellowship with you listen he don't want no tent wall between you he don't want your doubt in the way Sarah laughed at the very message of God right how many's got a friend that's laughed at the message of God you don't write them off if they're one of his they're going to bring forth Christ you keep right on praying if there's breath in their body I don't care where God's got to bring them if there's breath in their body you keep pray that's the spirit of Jesus Christ that's perfect love but brother they are bad bad bad I don't care you are bad bad bad too I'm a firm believer I'm tired of fighting that's right I fought long enough over this that and the other I want a body to come together and let's move if God uses this vessel and he does that don't go look into that vessel that he's anything no he was just a thumb that day but God wants to you use you as a finger the next day come on listen SS of God get behind them Glory you love him amen he's appearing he's here tonight he saw fit to come by this way because he knew somebody needed to hear a word personal to them that don't let that doubt don't let the deadness of how you feel don't let how how your body looks and how how Abra don't look how there's no listen we try to limit what God can do Sarah was limiting what God can do but the very scripture was a rhetorical question when it asked it is anything too hard for the Lord and if something right now in your mind believe you think Lord that's too hard I I can't have that kind of blessing brother Andrew can have that blessing that brother can have that blessing but lord I can't have well that's a wall let's address it tonight say Lord I don't want that wall any longer I want the Liberty to believe all things are possible and not have a doubt not have a funny feeling but believe it with all my heart and receive it glory to God you love him tonight the walls of your understanding oh my this is a big one Len I as a preacher I got to understand everything I got to know the seals backwards and forwards and about run you crazy and you get nowhere you know the devil will be like you don't understand enough come on preach to somebody now you don't you you can't have listen when we get to the other side they're not going to set you down and give you a testuj I believe God gives you everything you have need of when you need it how many's ever been witness to somebody and you didn't even know something and God quickens it to you and you be go boom boom boom boom and you walk away more surprise than they do then it isn't based on what you understand it it's based on can you have faith tonight to believe all things are possible I'm not going to let the wall of who I am or I don't understand this and I don't know this it ain't about what you know do you know him do you know him do you have that fellowship and if you don't have that fellowship tonight you don't have to leave here the same as what you came I'll say the rest of it in Jesus name here's another one the wall of your thoughts oh my that could go on forever I'm pretty empty-headed maybe not brother matter I've made too many mistakes amen hogwash amen caught in the very Act of adultery thrown at the very feet of Jesus and right there he rewrote her story right there he rewrote her story how many give Witness by a show of hands how many has he rewrote your story how many's had that thought that you've made too many mistakes after you've come to him well I'm just going to say Bo devil God's grace is sufficient I'm still here tonight I maybe didn't feel like I could be here there's been many times I've wanted to quit but you know what I'm still here tonight and while I'm here I might as well give him praise in the house of God I might as well worship Him and the same God that started that work is the same God that's going to complete that work how's he going to do it brother Matt little by little he will do it in your life and I'm a very example of the little by little but I'm not stopping there my expectation is higher my expectation is higher set your expectation higher don't get satisfied because the devil will wall you in right there here's another thought you can't have the Holy Ghost all right somebody's never had that thought not you not you can come up this far but and then all of a sudden you recognize what that is that's a lying Spirit from the straight from the pits of hell you realize he's right here right now trying to rob you of a blessing he's right here right now trying to tell you brother mat he's just speaking no this we have agreed together I am going to leave better than what I came in and we agreed in prayer we've already touched it so in my mind it's as good as done I believe right now people are already being changed I believe in the power of the word the power of the spoken word as the word of God goes forth and you come to church how many feels better than what they came in how many was tired well you've just come under the stimulation of the revelation of the word and it makes you a little bit happy and it makes you feel a little free and it makes you want to dance and it makes you want to shout yes it does why don't you preachers get it and maybe you'll understand what we're doing boo devil back off of us well brother Matt you said we need them yes we do need them we need him to preach the message of the hour here's another one see he doesn't really hear you you've prayed and prayed and prayed he done near you you he do yes he does yes he does I'll give you an example I was in a mall with my wife we were newly wedged maybe about a year or two and we were having a
