[45:04] [Applause]
[45:06] We love our brother Nathan. When I heard

[45:14] was glad to glad to have you sing, man.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Man, man.
[45:20] Good to be here this evening, isn't it?
[45:23] &gt;&gt; We want to be praying for
[45:26] the Biscll family and Cloverdale Bible
[45:29] Way there, the bride around the world.
[45:35] We certainly loved our brother Ed Bisll.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; He did a lot for each and every one of
[45:40] us whether you knew it or not.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; He was a trailblazer. That's right. for
[45:45] this message for this bride around the
[45:47] world.
[45:50] And he said, "If I could ever say what
[45:52] could what could I say I wanted to be
[45:55] remembered for?"
[45:59] Said he did what he could.
[46:02] And I say he did exactly that. He did
[46:05] everything that he could.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Everything. He laid it all on the line.
[46:12] That's right.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; So tonight,
[46:15] that's what I want to do.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I want to lay it all on the line.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to do.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; So I challenge you.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Lay it all on the line.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe we'll just go to prayer at this
[46:28] moment.
[46:30] Our dear heavenly father, Lord, we thank
[46:32] you for just letting us be able to
[46:34] gather here this evening.
[46:37] God, we can feel your presence hold so
[46:39] near right now.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:42] Oh God, as as we read these scriptures,
[46:46] the things that I've studied,
[46:49] Lord, put many hours into it,
[46:52] Lord. It's it's going to take you to
[46:54] lift it off the pages, to flow through
[46:57] our ears, into our hearts, into our
[46:59] souls. And I ask you that you'll just
[47:01] let us just open up to it this evening,
[47:03] God. Whatever you would have for the
[47:06] hearers, Lord, let us just have a heart
[47:08] that would receive it.
[47:10] Now God, I ask you that you'll just be
[47:12] with us this evening, Lord. Lord, bless
[47:15] the word that we're going to read. Lord,
[47:17] bless this bride. Bless the bride around
[47:21] the world, Lord. The Cloverdale Bible
[47:23] Way, the family there, Lord, the
[47:25] ministers that'll be speaking tomorrow.
[47:27] God, I ask you that you'll just minister
[47:29] to them all. In the name of Jesus
[47:31] Christ, we pray these things. Amen and
[47:34] amen.
[47:36] Amen. And if you would, I'd like to turn
[47:38] in our scriptures this evening to
[47:40] Matthew 4 and verse 12.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; This evening, I'd like to speak on the
[47:50] effect of that great light.
[48:00] So if you just bear with me this
[48:02] evening, I have a lot of scriptures and
[48:04] hopefully it can be lifted off the pages
[48:07] into each and every one of our hearts.
[48:09] So Matthew Matthew 4 and verse 12 it
[48:13] says now when Jesus heard that John was
[48:16] cast into prison he departed into
[48:18] Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and
[48:21] dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the sea
[48:24] coast in the borders of Zebulon and
[48:27] Nephilim. And it came that it might be
[48:30] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[48:33] prophet, saying, "The land of Zeblon,
[48:36] and the land of Nephilim, by the way of
[48:38] the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee, of the
[48:42] Gentiles,
[48:44] the people which sat in darkness saw
[48:46] great light. And to them which sat in
[48:50] the region of the shadow of death, light
[48:52] is sprung up."
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And from that time Jesus began to
[48:57] preach and say repent for the kingdom of
[49:01] heaven is at hand. Amen. You can be
[49:04] seated this evening. May God have his
[49:06] blessings on the reader of the word. So
[49:10] as I said, I'd like to preach on the
[49:12] effect of that great light.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; And we love love light. We love it here
[49:18] this evening. It would be dark as all
[49:20] get out if we didn't have light.
[49:23] And so as I as I studied on this, I
[49:25] thought about a story that I could tell
[49:27] y'all of when I was bow hunting years
[49:30] and years ago in National Forest and uh
[49:34] and where I would go. Dave and Jerry's
[49:36] been there with me and uh it's about a
[49:38] 45minute walk through the woods on this
[49:41] road and and so I'm about 30 minutes
[49:45] from where I'm supposed to be at. And I
[49:48] got a little much up here on the
[49:49] platform. if you turn me down just a
[49:51] little bit. Little bit of an echo. And
[49:54] so I'm about 30 minutes from my truck
[49:56] and getting close to where I'm supposed
[49:58] to be at. And it was dark and I had a
[50:02] flashlight
[50:04] and it's bow season and I had a bow and
[50:07] my light went out.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; Pitch dark. I'm carrying a bow, no
[50:14] light. And it was about the time that we
[50:17] didn't have all these flashlights on
[50:18] your cell phones and and I just had a
[50:21] cell phone, you know, that's that's
[50:23] about all. But about the time that my
[50:25] light went out, a pack of coyotes
[50:29] &gt;&gt; started howling in the valley. Just felt
[50:31] like it was really close. And you know,
[50:34] darkness, when it's dark like that,
[50:38] sound seems to travel. That's
[50:41] &gt;&gt; right. Come on. So, here I am in the
[50:44] pitch black, no light, trying to get to
[50:47] where I'm supposed to be by moonlight
[50:51] and it was very little. So, I was going
[50:54] more for kind of the shadows of things.
[50:57] And about that time in the morning,
[51:00] there's darkness that will play tricks
[51:02] on you.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; And then fear began to set in. And I
[51:07] began to turn back and look around. I
[51:10] kept hearing coyotes. And it felt like
[51:12] they was following me. And then I
[51:14] thought, well, maybe somebody's going to
[51:16] be coming up behind me and they can grab
[51:17] me. And I mean, this is National Forest.
[51:20] Nobody's going to know where I'm at
[51:21] here. I mean, I have a bow. It's not a
[51:25] rifle. It's a bow. Very, very lacking in
[51:29] response time.
[51:31] So, I managed to make my way to my
[51:34] treeand in dark. And when it become
[51:38] light,
[51:40] I didn't fear no more.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; That the greatest light naturally was
[51:47] shining.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Even if I had a flashlight, it would
[51:51] have did me no good at that point.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And the things that was scaring me in
[51:56] the dark,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; come on.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't scare me no more.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; I could turn around and see there's
[52:01] nobody for 300 yards.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Only an idiot would go where I was.
[52:06] in the dark.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; But you know that that darkness did
[52:11] something. It set a fear inside of me.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; It made my mind play tricks on me.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; But until that great light, come on.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Then it cast all those shadows away.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Good.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[52:30] The sun is the king of all lights on
[52:33] this earth in natural lights. No matter
[52:35] how much artificial light we can have,
[52:38] like I said, or how many great electric
[52:41] rays we can produce,
[52:44] when that sun rises, all the rest of
[52:47] them dim out.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; This is the same thing with the word of
[52:52] God.
[52:53] When the word of God rises, all
[52:55] superstitions, denominational
[52:58] fanaticisms, and things spread away and
[53:02] it shows exactly what it is. God in the
[53:06] beginning said, "Let there be light."
[53:07] And the light only comes, the true
[53:10] light, the king light comes by the word
[53:13] of God.
[53:15] God separated light from the darkness in
[53:17] the beginning. And the word of God made
[53:20] manifest always separates light from the
[53:24] darkness.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; So I'd like to go into our scripture
[53:27] readings that we had this evening and
[53:29] I'd like to break them down just a
[53:30] little bit further into each one of
[53:33] their meetings. And in verse 12 it says,
[53:35] "Now when Jesus heard that John was cast
[53:37] into prison, he departed into Galilee."
[53:40] Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; See, John the Baptist was preparing the
[53:44] way of the Lord. In Matthew 3 and 2 and
[53:46] 3, it says, "And saying, John the
[53:49] Baptist was preaching, repent ye, for
[53:52] the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For
[53:54] this is he that was spoken by the
[53:57] prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one
[54:00] crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the
[54:03] way of the Lord, and make his paths
[54:06] straight."
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; So John is doing what he could. He was
[54:10] preaching his his word
[54:13] &gt;&gt; and here's Jesus and he hears that John
[54:16] is now cast into prison.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't go and comfort John,
[54:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:22] &gt;&gt; He goes, as I was as you would say, he
[54:26] is now receiving the baton to continue
[54:29] his message.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; And I am sure that there was people that
[54:34] was following John the Baptist that
[54:36] would not follow Jesus.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; The same thing happens in today.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; There is people that will follow William
[54:43] Brandham, but that as far as they'll go.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; They won't go no further.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; And so Jesus departed and he went into
[54:52] Galilee. He didn't go to comfort John,
[54:55] but he went into Galilee.
[54:57] And this marks a turning point in their
[54:59] ministry there.
[55:01] Jesus doesn't go to Jerusalem, the most
[55:04] holy city there is.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; To show God's
[55:09] plan in the most holy city. He goes to
[55:13] Galilee,
[55:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in
[55:17] Capernium.
[55:19] So you see now Galilee is a region. So
[55:22] let's just let's just say it like this.
[55:24] We're in Rockingham County
[55:27] and let's say Grotto is kind of Nazareth
[55:32] and and I'm just trying to give you a
[55:34] comparison of what we're what we're
[55:35] dealing with here. And and so that's the
[55:38] same county but he's going into more of
[55:43] Galilee than northern part as we would
[55:46] say of Galilee.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; And so that would be putting in your
[55:50] mind of Timberville. So southern part is
[55:53] Gro. Timberville is the northernmost
[55:55] part.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So he's now in Capernium which is by the
[55:59] sea.
[56:00] And the reason why God chooses Galilee
[56:03] is because it was prophesied
[56:06] of a fulfillment of prophecy by Isaiah
[56:08] in Isaiah 9 and2. And the people that
[56:12] walked in darkness have seen a great
[56:16] light.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; They that dwelt in the land of the
[56:20] shadow of death, upon them hath the
[56:23] light shined. See, this is Isaiah's
[56:26] prophecy
[56:28] &gt;&gt; in Isaiah.
[56:30] And you go on down a little further and
[56:32] it says in verse 6, it says, "For unto
[56:36] us a child is born, for unto us a son is
[56:39] given, and the government shall be upon
[56:41] his shoulders, and his name shall be
[56:43] called wonderful counselor."
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; The mighty God, the everlasting father,
[56:48] the prince of peace. So here we are
[56:51] seeing prophecy being fulfilled.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; When he goes into Galilee,
[56:57] people that set walked in darkness have
[57:00] seen a great light. What is darkness?
[57:02] Darkness is ignorance, sin,
[57:06] &gt;&gt; despair,
[57:07] &gt;&gt; spiritual blindness,
[57:10] &gt;&gt; what is that great light? It's Jesus
[57:13] himself bringing revelation, truth, and
[57:16] hope.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; They would call it Galilee of the
[57:20] Gentiles.
[57:22] See, it shows that he is willing to go
[57:25] into dark places. That's right.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Spiritually dark places.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; And the reason why we know that Isaiah
[57:34] is saying that this is a Galilee is such
[57:37] a dark place is Isaiah would say in not
[57:41] Isaiah, but in 2 Kings and 15, there are
[57:44] some names there that I cannot
[57:45] pronounce. And so I'm just going to say
[57:47] Assyrians had taken the Galileans
[57:50] captive.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And so the Assyrians had brought the
[57:54] Galileans away from there. And so they
[57:56] kind of uh more of deportation
[57:59] &gt;&gt; had pulled the Galileans into Syria. And
[58:03] so with that being said, the Galilee is
[58:07] now a place where more people was
[58:10] coming. Not just Jews, but Assyrians, a
[58:14] mixture of pe people. This is be
[58:16] starting to become a a bread basket of
[58:19] people of gods,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Jews,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Gentiles.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; So, it's becoming a very dark place in
[58:27] the spiritual realm. That's
[58:28] &gt;&gt; right. Amen.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; It's not a bright place. It's not the
[58:31] religious city of Jerusalem, but Galilee
[58:34] is where he chose to start his ministry.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; Not just start it. He chose to then go
[58:40] get disciples from that point.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, man.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; So, you may be in darkness in this time,
[58:46] in this day, but God has chosen you,
[58:48] sir. Come on.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; He has chosen you to step out and say,
[58:52] "I want a bride, a gentile bride.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; A bride that is in the darkness, but I'm
[58:57] bringing her out in revelation here."
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; And so, he began to preach, repent, for
[59:04] the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Now I
[59:07] am sure that there was Sadducees and
[59:10] other Jewish rel leaders that had tried
[59:13] to go up there and they tried to condemn
[59:17] &gt;&gt; condemn the Galileans for the way that
[59:19] they was living. Condemning them for
[59:21] their gods. But you see there's a
[59:23] difference in repentance and condemning
[59:27] someone.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; See, repentance is a positive. It's a
[59:31] constructive act involving a change of
[59:33] mind, heart to turn away from sin and
[59:36] towards God
[59:38] &gt;&gt; leading to forgiveness, hope, and a
[59:40] fresh start. Condemnation
[59:43] is a negative. It's a state of being
[59:46] fueled with guilt,
[59:47] &gt;&gt; shame, despair. And it drives one away
[59:51] from God and denies the posit
[59:54] possibilities of grace and forgiveness.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. While both feelings involve sorrow
[1:00:00] over sin, repentance leads to salvation.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; It leads to restoration.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Whereas condemnation leads to
[1:00:11] hopelessness and spiritual death. And so
[1:00:14] here we see all of the Galileans with
[1:00:17] all of these Jewish leaders with
[1:00:19] condemning. That's
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; They felt condemned, but they didn't
[1:00:24] know what to do. That's
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; right. Come on. as they was being
[1:00:27] condemned. Well, what what good is
[1:00:29] there? We're so far away from Jerusalem
[1:00:31] that you're condemning us for living in
[1:00:33] Galilee, but we can't move to Jerusalem.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be So, what do we do?
[1:00:40] They had nothing to provide. No light to
[1:00:44] give them spiritually.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus giving them light.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; He is giving them light for what they
[1:00:54] are in at this moment. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1, it says,
[1:01:02] "In the beginning, God created the
[1:01:04] heaven and the earth, and the earth was
[1:01:06] without form and void, and darkness was
[1:01:08] upon the face of the deep, and the
[1:01:10] spirit of God moved upon the waters."
[1:01:15] See, Jesus didn't start a new creation
[1:01:18] then.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; God was used to starting new creations,
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:23] But see, God didn't leave everything in
[1:01:26] darkness. He spoke, "Let there be
[1:01:30] light." And there was light.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And God saw the light that it was good.
[1:01:35] And God divided the light from the
[1:01:37] darkness. And God called the light day,
[1:01:40] and the darkness he called night. And
[1:01:43] the evening and the morning were the
[1:01:45] first day.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Now, don't miss this.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Don't miss this.
[1:01:50] When he spoke that,
[1:01:52] darkness fled.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; There was a mist upon all of the region
[1:01:59] of the earth,
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; but there was no light until God spoke,
[1:02:04] "Let there be light."
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; He created light.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; This is natural light.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; He is creating natural light. That's
[1:02:13] right.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; He is calling
[1:02:17] darkness
[1:02:19] suppressing it and calling chaos out of
[1:02:22] darkness.
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Bringing order out of chaos.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; And he's doing the same thing in your
[1:02:30] life.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; When he's shining the light on you, he's
[1:02:34] bringing order into chaos.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; For he said, "Repent because my kingdom
[1:02:42] is at hand and his light will shine on
[1:02:45] you." In shalom, brother Brandham says,
[1:02:48] "What is light?" It is the vindicated
[1:02:51] spoken word of God.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Outside of that, there is no light.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; You can't lighten the earth by
[1:02:58] flashlights. It takes God word to
[1:03:02] manifest the sun.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus didn't go down there with a
[1:03:06] stream light or a spotlight and a pack
[1:03:09] of dur Duracells.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:03:12] amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; He read the scriptures. He knew. Isaiah
[1:03:16] said, "The people that sat in great
[1:03:18] darkness, why don't we take them a
[1:03:20] flashlight?"
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Well, there you go. Can you see?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Can you see?
[1:03:28] So, I want to speak it so plainly that
[1:03:31] even the children understand it's not a
[1:03:33] flashlight that Jesus brought down to
[1:03:35] them. That's right.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; He was the light.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; He was the light.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; How do we know he was the light? Well,
[1:03:43] let's just go to that. See, there was
[1:03:45] wise men that come from afar.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; See, and Jesus will draw people from
[1:03:51] many nations.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; And when those wise men come to Herod,
[1:03:55] they said, "We have come to worship him.
[1:03:58] We have followed that light."
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east and we
[1:04:04] have come to worship him.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:11] Yes, sir.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And there they
[1:04:13] stood, spellbound.
[1:04:15] They couldn't speak another word, for
[1:04:17] the glory of the light had spellbound
[1:04:20] them." Oh, how it is today, my poor,
[1:04:23] decrepit friend. And when a man who has
[1:04:27] never known his power to give new light,
[1:04:30] to give new hope, when he walks into the
[1:04:32] presence of the divine person of Christ
[1:04:35] with faith that holds him spellbound to
[1:04:39] his majesty,
[1:04:41] it isn't like walking into to an altar
[1:04:44] or giving the minister your right hand.
[1:04:47] or neither is it like going to the pool
[1:04:49] to be baptized or standing with a shell
[1:04:53] to be sprinkled. It's walking into the
[1:04:56] light that you have never witnessed
[1:04:59] before.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; It's an anchor of divine faith that
[1:05:04] calls anything contrary to the word of
[1:05:07] God as though it wasn't.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It puts new life. It gives hope to the
[1:05:13] dying. It gives courage to the weak. It
[1:05:15] gives healing to the sick. It gives
[1:05:18] blessing to the unfavored.
[1:05:20] How wonderful it is to step into that
[1:05:23] light of his presence.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; It's not a myth. Neither is it something
[1:05:28] that somebody just fleshly in their
[1:05:31] minds drawled up. But it's something
[1:05:33] that directly into the presence of the
[1:05:36] king of glory, the eternal light of the
[1:05:40] living God.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There they stood spellbound,
[1:05:44] couldn't speak a word because of his
[1:05:47] presence.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Because he is here.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; We have come far to worship him. See,
[1:05:56] there was something that was drawing
[1:05:58] them out.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; And we can see that even in the natural.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; In the natural, we can see how that
[1:06:05] light, you can put bury a seed under a
[1:06:08] slab of concrete,
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; concrete that thing over.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. But there is something
[1:06:12] about that natural sun that when it
[1:06:14] begins to heat up that concrete, when it
[1:06:16] begins to heat up that ground, there's
[1:06:18] something in that seed that it says
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; there's something more.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; There's something more. And it begins to
[1:06:25] wiggle its way maybe for miles and
[1:06:27] miles. It begins to just travel. And
[1:06:29] there at the edge of that concrete,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; there comes life.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Why is it? Because there was something
[1:06:36] that was drawing at. It was a light
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; that was pulling it.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; It was a light that was pulling them
[1:06:43] wise men.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And that light will pull wise men.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; See, if you're you're in the darkness
[1:06:49] and there's something that's drawing
[1:06:50] you,
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; you may have darkness all around you in
[1:06:53] your life. But you know that there is
[1:06:55] something that's pulling you that keeps
[1:06:57] going pulling you and you're like, I
[1:06:59] don't know what it is, but it continues
[1:07:01] to just pull me, pull me because there
[1:07:04] is a seed laying on the inside of you.
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; There was something that was drawing
[1:07:11] you. Now, it wasn't the natural son that
[1:07:14] was drawing you. It was God.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; He was calling you. Said, "I'm going to
[1:07:19] call you up a little higher. I need some
[1:07:21] worshippers. I need a bride in this last
[1:07:24] gentile age.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; When this age is the darkest of all
[1:07:27] ages, he said, "I am the light
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; that has draw you back to me."
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, in him there is no darkness
[1:07:37] whatsoever.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; You can take a flashlight and I talked
[1:07:40] to a coal miner one time and he said
[1:07:42] that you go down into those coal mines
[1:07:44] of West Virginia and it is so dark in
[1:07:47] the darkest parts of that earth that you
[1:07:50] cannot see your hand in front of your
[1:07:51] face.
[1:07:53] But when you pull out a light, that
[1:07:56] thing lights up what you're looking at.
[1:07:59] But you see, there is no light. There is
[1:08:02] no darkness inside of where that light
[1:08:05] is. That's
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; We're in the darkest of the darkest
[1:08:09] places,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; And you could see maybe it's a circular
[1:08:13] light. It's a circle. Well, inside of
[1:08:15] that circle, there is no darkness,
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a square
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; inside of that square of that light.
[1:08:23] Natural, I'm talking about a flashlight.
[1:08:25] There is no darkness inside of that.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Right? But see, there then comes maybe a
[1:08:32] hand. It creates a shadow.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would talk about a
[1:08:38] false light.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That is maybe the greatest robbery that
[1:08:43] has ever happened in history. It was due
[1:08:45] to a false light.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; It was a glare.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; The train that was coming down through
[1:08:51] there that was carrying over $7 million
[1:08:53] worth of jewels or money, whatever it
[1:08:55] would have been. But that robbery is
[1:08:58] done by a false light.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan has tried to do in
[1:09:03] this last day is to catch you by a false
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; false light.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; By a glare,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; see, he knows he can't produce light.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; So he has to be a glare of the true
[1:09:16] light.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:24] And so you see that that glare is
[1:09:27] causing people to go astray. That's
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; right. Come on.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; Causing people to go outside of that
[1:09:32] light. That's
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Draws you a light
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; away. Not a light because he cannot
[1:09:39] produce light.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's only one that gives light
[1:09:42] that is God.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. See now he produces and creates
[1:09:48] but he also separates.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; He separate the light from the darkness.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; See when he gets ready to leave or to
[1:10:00] use a group of people he has to separate
[1:10:03] the light from the darkness. When he
[1:10:05] gets ready to use an individual he has
[1:10:08] to separate the light from the darkness.
[1:10:12] Light comes by God. And remember the
[1:10:14] light come by his spoken word. The word
[1:10:18] of God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:10:20] there was light. There was and when
[1:10:23] there was no light, he sent the light to
[1:10:26] separate the darkness from the light.
[1:10:29] First John, excuse me, John 1 and1. It
[1:10:32] says, "In the beginning was the word and
[1:10:34] the word was God and the word was with
[1:10:37] God. And the same in the beginning with
[1:10:40] God, all things were made by him, and
[1:10:43] without him was not anything made that
[1:10:46] was made. In him was life, and the life
[1:10:50] was the light of men. And the light that
[1:10:53] shineth in darkness, and darkness
[1:10:56] comprehended it not."
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; See Jesus being that light. There is
[1:11:02] darkness. But the darkness cannot
[1:11:04] comprehend
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; See, we know that Jesus was that light
[1:11:11] because scripture con consistently
[1:11:13] identifies him that way.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; By his life, his word spoke. The works
[1:11:19] confirm it. When God's light shine, it
[1:11:22] doesn't just break darkness. It draws
[1:11:25] people in.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:28] Just as that star led them across
[1:11:30] nations to Jesus.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's his light and he always does it.
[1:11:35] It reveals, it guides, and it attracts.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; So that's how we know that was Jesus was
[1:11:45] that great light.
[1:11:48] See even then in Luke 2 and 25
[1:11:53] says behold there was a man in Jerusalem
[1:11:55] whose name was Simon Simeon
[1:11:58] and the same man was just and devout
[1:12:02] waiting for consolation of Israel and
[1:12:06] the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was
[1:12:09] revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that
[1:12:12] he should not see death before he had
[1:12:15] seen the Lord's Christ
[1:12:18] and he came by the spirit
[1:12:21] and he came by the spirit unto the
[1:12:23] temple. And when the parents brought in
[1:12:27] the child Jesus
[1:12:29] to do for him after the
[1:12:33] custom of the law, then took him up into
[1:12:37] his arms and blessed God, and said, "The
[1:12:41] Lord now let us my servant depart in
[1:12:44] peace according to thy word. For mine
[1:12:47] eyes have seen the salvation which thou
[1:12:50] hast prepared before the face of all
[1:12:53] people, a light to lighten the Gentiles.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And the glory of
[1:13:00] of thy people of Israel.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure that there is many people
[1:13:05] that was in the temple that morning that
[1:13:07] wish that Simeon would have prayed that
[1:13:09] prayer over their child. Hey, come on.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; How many hundreds of children had come
[1:13:14] into the temples for years and years
[1:13:17] that Simeon had held had blessed?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; But here's Jesus.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Here is the one that he has prayed to
[1:13:25] see before his death.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; And how does he compare him? As a light
[1:13:32] to lightenth the Gentiles. That's right.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; What is lighten?
[1:13:39] Light to lighten it is to provide
[1:13:41] spiritual understanding, illumination
[1:13:45] to re to reveal to others.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; It is revelation.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; What is he? He's going to revelate
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; the people of Israel. Thank you. Amen.
[1:13:57] Amen.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; In John 1 John 1:5, it says, "Then this
[1:14:02] message which we have heard of him
[1:14:04] declare unto you that God is light and
[1:14:08] in him is no darkness whatsoever."
[1:14:10] Darkness at all. Sorry, that was me
[1:14:12] saying that there is no darkness at all.
[1:14:15] And if you say that we have fellowship
[1:14:17] with him and walk in darkness, we lie
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; and do not the truth. But if we walk in
[1:14:24] the light as he is the light, we have
[1:14:26] fellowship one with another.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[1:14:31] cleanses us from all of our sins.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; See, he's that light.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to cleanse you
[1:14:38] from all of your sins.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; That's him.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; That's the one we've been looking for.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; That's the light.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; That's how we know he's the light.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. There's not another name
[1:14:49] that men and blood sh can be baptized
[1:14:51] but under the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14:53] Christ
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; at all is in him no darkness
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; because he said I am the light
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; to the world right
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; he went ahead and let's just go and
[1:15:06] declare this
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I'm him I'm the light
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; that lightth the world and he that
[1:15:12] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[1:15:15] but shall have light of life.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing that he did
[1:15:20] with the woman at the well.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; They're in Samaria, one of the cities
[1:15:25] that even the Jews and even the
[1:15:27] Gentiles, they didn't really even want
[1:15:28] to go back and forth.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Even the disciples, Peter and all of
[1:15:32] them, they would rather have went across
[1:15:34] Jordan up into Galilee and stay away
[1:15:37] from Samaria,
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; the Samaritan woman, woman at the well.
[1:15:41] But he says, "I have needs to go by."
[1:15:46] Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; He had needs to go by her way because he
[1:15:49] was the light to her that day.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; When she sat there and she began to pour
[1:15:54] and he said, "Give me to drink."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Says, "Sir, you have not a cup and the
[1:16:00] wa well was deep."
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're right. But if you would
[1:16:04] ask me of a drink,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; there it is.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You'd thirst no more."
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:11] See, he was beginning to reveal who he
[1:16:14] was.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Then she became religious with him.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; She became religious with him. She said,
[1:16:20] "Well, we can't worship here because
[1:16:22] worship is in Jerusalem. Worship is in
[1:16:24] the temples."
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? But there's
[1:16:30] going to come a time
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; that you neither worship in this
[1:16:33] mountain nor Jerusalem, but you'll
[1:16:34] worship everywhere.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; You're going to worship like true
[1:16:38] worshippers will. Amen.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; And then he be to explain and tell her
[1:16:43] everything because see the light was now
[1:16:47] shining in her dark places.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; And that effect of him
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; was starting to shine through.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe I perceive you are a
[1:16:57] prophet."
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Says, "I am he
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; that they foretold about.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; I'm that one."
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Hey, let me tell you what. When that
[1:17:06] come revelation to her, she dropped her
[1:17:09] water pot. She began to reay back and
[1:17:11] she began to testify of that great light
[1:17:14] of what he had just done. He had
[1:17:16] revealed the hearts and secret of her.
[1:17:18] And that's the same thing in today. God
[1:17:20] is manifesting the hearts and secret of
[1:17:22] the people. It's opening up the word of
[1:17:25] revelation to each and every one of us
[1:17:27] in this dark age. Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; John Wesley's notes on 8, John 8:12, he
[1:17:33] says, "He that followeth me shall in no
[1:17:36] wise walk in darkness."
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He says, "In ignorance, in wickedness,
[1:17:41] in misery, darkness is misery,
[1:17:44] ignorance, all of these things,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; but shall have light of life. He that
[1:17:49] closely, humbly, steadily follows me,
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; there it is,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; shall have divine light continually
[1:17:57] shining upon him, diffusing over his
[1:18:01] soul knowledge,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; holiness, joy,
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; till he has got it by the everlasting
[1:18:08] life.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. This was John Wesley's
[1:18:12] notes
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; on that
[1:18:16] because that light will produce life.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; You can go into the darkest depths of
[1:18:24] the sea where it's so dark.
[1:18:28] There is life down there, but because it
[1:18:32] is so dark, it begins to create
[1:18:35] creatures that look so monstrously
[1:18:39] horrible.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what darkness produces.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; monsters. Things that really don't look
[1:18:47] like they should.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's good. It's good.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; But when
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; you're closer to that natural light,
[1:18:55] things start to appear as they should.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Fish begin to look like they should.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Deer begin to feast upon the acorns that
[1:19:03] the tree has now buted forth and it has
[1:19:06] produced because of that natural light.
[1:19:09] That's right. see that that natural
[1:19:11] light will do things throughout the
[1:19:13] year. Now, I'm no gardener,
[1:19:17] but I would guarantee that if I begin to
[1:19:19] plant corn right now that people would
[1:19:22] laugh at me. That's
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Because the season of the light has
[1:19:27] changed.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; If I go out and I started planting green
[1:19:32] beans and and other things, am I right
[1:19:35] in saying that that right now is not a
[1:19:38] good time? That's right.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Like I said, I'm no gardener, but I I'm
[1:19:43] pretty sure of this.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Because that natural light,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; is at that point to where it's harvest
[1:19:53] time.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Because it's already did the process in
[1:19:57] summer.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Towards the ending of summer. Now we're
[1:20:02] in September and we're getting harvest.
[1:20:05] You're seeing the great combines come
[1:20:07] by. Right?
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You're seeing all of those things that
[1:20:10] that you had planted things had been
[1:20:13] planted back in spring.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Now they're at full manifestation of
[1:20:17] what that natural light did.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing with the S O
[1:20:23] N.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. There you go.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Make sure I get that right. The same
[1:20:27] thing with the S O N is when he starts
[1:20:29] to shine on you.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; And when you begin to just feel that
[1:20:34] power,
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; you begin to feel that growth. Amen.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; And you're alive.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; You're full of life.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Because he's life.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; He gave you life.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; It has a transforming power within it.
[1:20:53] That's the biggest evidence of it. Light
[1:20:56] changes things. Wherever Jesus is
[1:20:59] received, darkness, sin, confusion, fear
[1:21:02] is gone. And people's lives are
[1:21:05] radically transformed.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You may be sitting here this evening and
[1:21:10] say, "Well, how do I shine light?"
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; That's a genuine question. Well, h how
[1:21:15] do I shine light?
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; I know Jesus is that light,
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; They testified of it. But now, how do I
[1:21:23] shine light?
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; How do I become light?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus told you you are.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; He said you are the light of the world.
[1:21:33] a city that is set up on a hill that
[1:21:35] cannot be healed.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Neither do men
[1:21:39] light a candle and put it under a
[1:21:41] bushel,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; but on a candlestick, and it giveth
[1:21:44] light unto all that are in the house.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; before men, that they may see your good
[1:21:52] works, and glorify your father which is
[1:21:54] in heaven.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; You're the light.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Look over each neighbor. Say, "I'm a
[1:22:00] light."
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; I'm a light. And how do I know that?
[1:22:03] Because Jesus told me I'm a light.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'm just doing what Jesus told me I was
[1:22:07] to do.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; And I accepted that.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I am that light.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; See, and if we walk in darkness, we're
[1:22:15] not that light.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; You can't reflect him if you're refusing
[1:22:22] that light.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; And to refuse light is to walk in
[1:22:25] darkness.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what your prophet said. To
[1:22:28] refuse light is to walk in darkness.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; To refuse the light of your day
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; is to walk in darkness.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; There was many that sat there and they
[1:22:39] and even in today they want to accept
[1:22:42] John Wesley. They want to accept Lofer's
[1:22:44] age, but they want to walk in the light
[1:22:46] of the past. But let me just say that
[1:22:48] light's gone out.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That light is gone out. And to refuse
[1:22:54] the new light that Jesus has provided
[1:22:57] that we have a profit of that's given us
[1:22:59] this.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; To refuse this is to walk in darkness.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; To refuse light is to walk in darkness.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; What is light? It's revelation.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Revelation unto you.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; See, you are a reflection of him.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; As the moon is a reflection of the sun,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; you are a reflection of him.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; You live differently.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; You love, forgive.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; You remain faithful when others apart.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; You do good works.
[1:23:37] You resist the darkness.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; You resist.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Resist the darkness.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; That's what light does.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Resist it.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You stay close to that light. Well, how
[1:23:52] do I stay close to him? Read your Bible.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Pray.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Worship.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; He gave it all right here.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; He gave it all in his word. How do I
[1:24:03] reflect him?
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Right there.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Start reading psalms.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Start giving him worship. Start singing
[1:24:09] songs.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee your atmosphere will
[1:24:13] change because of light bringing life
[1:24:16] into your day.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; So you shine light. You do good works.
[1:24:21] You speak truth and you expose the
[1:24:23] darkness. See, God gave you this light
[1:24:26] to shine. You know, it's kind of like
[1:24:28] going to the doctor and the doctor's
[1:24:31] asking you a certain question and and
[1:24:34] and he begins to ask you certain things
[1:24:38] and then maybe your wife or somebody
[1:24:41] that took you starts beginning to
[1:24:43] answer.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; How you how you feel, sir? And she
[1:24:49] speaks up. He's not doing good at all.
[1:24:52] He's not doing good. And he's sitting
[1:24:54] there going, "I I feel fine. I don't
[1:24:56] even know why I have this appointment."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Well, you see, he's got this he's got
[1:25:03] this issue in his heart. And I'm like,
[1:25:04] "You you need to be quiet over there.
[1:25:08] See, the doctor is asking him."
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; And the same thing with shining someone
[1:25:13] else's light.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach, buddy.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Now, there was people that would love to
[1:25:17] shine your light. Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan is a great singer, great
[1:25:23] worshipper,
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; and there is other people that would
[1:25:26] want to shine Nathan's light.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, Nathan, you ought to sing like this.
[1:25:32] Nathan, you ought to sing this song.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Nathan is shining his light.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; There's people that want to shine your
[1:25:42] light, but they can't even control their
[1:25:43] light.
[1:25:50] They can't control their own life or
[1:25:53] their light.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; You know, it's kind of like shining a
[1:25:58] bright light in your face.
[1:26:01] Sister Cassie, she bought me a spotlight
[1:26:03] the other day cuz we needed one at our
[1:26:05] house. Not for hunting. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:10] Because I have new life.
[1:26:13] So, she went to Home Depot or Lowe's and
[1:26:16] and she grabbed this spotlight and and
[1:26:18] she was telling me about it while I'm on
[1:26:19] the phone and and she did something. She
[1:26:22] hit the trigger of that light and she
[1:26:25] didn't realize it was fully charged. And
[1:26:28] so, for several minutes, she saw spots
[1:26:33] because it was so bright
[1:26:36] and so close that now she's seeing
[1:26:39] spots. She's seeing darkness because of
[1:26:42] how bright it was.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And that is how you need to be prepared
[1:26:49] to not do to someone that's an
[1:26:50] unbeliever.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Because your light is so bright
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; and you're wanting to shine it so
[1:26:58] powerful,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; they're not going to see it,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; They're only going to see spots. They're
[1:27:05] going to continue to see dark things.
[1:27:07] And it's like,
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; don't you see it? He's the prophet.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; They
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; they didn't see it.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; They don't see it.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; So, you have to guide them.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; You have to shine light unto their
[1:27:28] pathway.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Benjamin Franklin, he would uh
[1:27:36] he would think he had light.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would fly that kite and put
[1:27:41] that bottle on there maybe with that key
[1:27:43] is what they say and he's flying that
[1:27:46] kite
[1:27:47] and all of a sudden lightning strikes
[1:27:49] that that light that bottle and that key
[1:27:52] and he's got it. I got it. I got it. I
[1:27:55] got it. See, he didn't know what he had.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; He had something but he didn't know what
[1:28:02] he had. That's
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; right. Come on now. But it took people
[1:28:06] like Edison,
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Albert Einstein,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; and other ones to create energy
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; which is harnessing that light.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Harnessing that power.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; And we thank God for it here.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; We thank God for a man that can turn on
[1:28:23] the light.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Alen, we thank God for him.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; He knows how to harness that power. I do
[1:28:29] not. If I'm your electrician, you're
[1:28:32] going to get water coming out of that
[1:28:33] electric spout.
[1:28:36] I'm sorry. I'm not that. I'm a
[1:28:39] demolition guy.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But see, it's a harnessing of that
[1:28:45] power. And that's the same thing that we
[1:28:48] have today. There's many people
[1:28:50] screaming, "They got it. They got it.
[1:28:52] They got it."
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; But they don't have a clue what they
[1:28:55] got.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. You
[1:28:59] might feel your hand. You might feel a
[1:29:01] sweep, a air conditioned
[1:29:05] through the building. Oh, I felt it.
[1:29:10] What was that? What? But do you believe
[1:29:13] that?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe what the light is
[1:29:17] providing?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; See, there are many people saying, "I
[1:29:21] got it." But what do you got?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Ben Franklin was doing the same thing.
[1:29:26] What do you got? Brother Brandon would
[1:29:29] say this in El Shetty. I said Jes Jesus
[1:29:32] never did say did I feel did you feel it
[1:29:35] he said did you believe it see
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; not did you feel it do you believe it
[1:29:41] faith is not feeling faith is something
[1:29:43] that you don't feel
[1:29:45] you have no senses will declare it only
[1:29:49] that six sense that faith that knows it
[1:29:53] you don't feel taste smell or hear it
[1:29:55] but you know it
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said so That settles it
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; because he said so that settles it. And
[1:30:04] if I could ever get the message sometime
[1:30:07] that would shake the people away from
[1:30:09] all of this Hollywood evangelism
[1:30:12] and get them down to the Bible to thus
[1:30:15] sayaith the Lord. Then something would
[1:30:18] happen. It would be more than I got it.
[1:30:20] I got it. They'd have it.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; They truly have it. See, it's
[1:30:25] revelation.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to read a little bit from
[1:30:29] the uh seven church ages here if you
[1:30:31] bear with me. This is revelation that
[1:30:35] Jesus Christ had given to the scribes.
[1:30:38] And it says in Revelations 1 1 and three
[1:30:43] says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:45] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[1:30:48] servants things which must shortly come
[1:30:50] to pass. He sent and signified it by his
[1:30:54] angel unto his servant John, who bare
[1:30:57] record of the word of God, and of the
[1:31:00] testimony of Jesus Christ, of all things
[1:31:04] that had that he saw. Blessed is he that
[1:31:08] readeth, and they that bear the words of
[1:31:11] his prophecy
[1:31:13] hear sorry, hear the words of his
[1:31:16] prophecy, and keep those things which
[1:31:19] are written.
[1:31:21] See what is what is revelation? The
[1:31:24] Greek word revelation is apocalypse.
[1:31:27] It's an unveiling. It's an uncovering.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; So revelation is the person of Jesus
[1:31:32] Christ. But it has to be revelation of
[1:31:36] his future works in the oncoming seven
[1:31:38] church ages. See all revelation it is
[1:31:42] tremendously important to the church.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:31:46] See in Matthew 16 it says, "Whom do men
[1:31:50] say that I, the son of man, am?" And
[1:31:53] they said, "Some say that thou are John
[1:31:55] the Baptist? Some say Elijah, and others
[1:31:57] Jeremiah, and one of the other one of
[1:32:00] the prophets, and he saith unto him, but
[1:32:02] whom do you say that I am?"
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou
[1:32:07] art the Christ,
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God." And Jesus
[1:32:12] answered and said unto him, "Blessed art
[1:32:13] thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and
[1:32:15] blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
[1:32:18] but my father which is in heaven." What
[1:32:20] is that? Revelation.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; It was revelation that struck his heart.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and
[1:32:29] upon this rock I will build my church,
[1:32:32] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:32:34] against it. See, God can't build his
[1:32:37] church upon any man born in sin. That's
[1:32:40] right.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; So, you can't build the church up on
[1:32:43] Peter.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Can't build it on Peter. Peter,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; it wasn't some rock that was laying
[1:32:50] there
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; as though God had hallowed out the
[1:32:53] ground in that spot. It isn't
[1:32:57] the protest. It isn't, as the
[1:32:59] Protestants would say, the church is
[1:33:01] built upon Jesus. It was revelation.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Read it. Revealed,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; right? hath revealed it. And upon this
[1:33:11] rock of revelation, I will build my
[1:33:14] church.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; The rock,
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; the church is built upon revelation.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; That's the effect of the light.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; The effect of the light will bring
[1:33:25] revelation.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; How do you know? How did Abel know
[1:33:34] to sacrifice to God faith? He received
[1:33:37] the revelation of the blood and Cain
[1:33:40] didn't.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; See, he had that same chance. Now, I
[1:33:43] don't want to get on tomorrow's sermon.
[1:33:45] So, he had that same chance of
[1:33:47] revelation.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; But it was revelation to Simon, to Peter
[1:33:53] that said, "Upon this rock,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; I will build my church." Upon
[1:33:57] revelation, see, it's a reflection of
[1:34:00] that great light. See, when you start to
[1:34:02] begin to reflect God's light,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. what you truly are and
[1:34:08] what he truly is.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; I love Psalms 27. It says, "The Lord is
[1:34:13] my light
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; and my salvation.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. Whom shall I be
[1:34:22] afraid?"
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; See, if he is your light, who's there to
[1:34:26] be scared of?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; If he is your light,
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; there's no reason to be scared.
[1:34:33] The Lord is my life and my strength.
[1:34:37] Whom shall I be afraid?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing in this dark age
[1:34:41] that you can be afraid of
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; if you truly accept him, the revelation
[1:34:47] of this hour, Jesus Christ,
[1:34:50] there's nothing to be scared of. That's
[1:34:52] right.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; When you're accepting into him, received
[1:34:54] his water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:34:56] Christ, you're walking in that light of
[1:34:59] the word.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me move on. I'm going to be
[1:35:02] too too lengthy and I don't want to pull
[1:35:04] a last weekend here.
[1:35:07] Brother Joe ending for the next 30
[1:35:09] minutes. You know,
[1:35:14] I love him. He's my buddy. So, I can say
[1:35:15] this kind of stuff. It's here in
[1:35:18] Revelations 1
[1:35:20] 12-20. And let's get on down here. Says,
[1:35:23] "Fear not. I am the first and I am the
[1:35:25] last. I am he that liveth and was dead.
[1:35:29] And behold, I am alive forever more.
[1:35:31] Amen. And hath the keys of hell and of
[1:35:35] death. Write these things which thou
[1:35:39] hast seen, and the things which are, and
[1:35:43] the things which shall be hereafter,
[1:35:46] the mystery of the seven stars which
[1:35:48] thou sawest in the right hand, and the
[1:35:52] seven golden candlesticks. The seven
[1:35:54] stars are the angels of the seven
[1:35:57] churches.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Do we understand that? The seven stars
[1:36:01] are the angel of the seven churches. And
[1:36:04] the seven candlesticks which thou sawest
[1:36:07] are the seven churches.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; So let's just go down through here
[1:36:10] quickly. The seven church age
[1:36:12] messengers. See, you would have the
[1:36:15] Apostle Paul, the Ephesians church age.
[1:36:17] You have Arinius, the Samrian's church
[1:36:20] age. You have Martin, the Pergamin
[1:36:22] church age. Columba of Ireland, the thy
[1:36:26] f thytherian.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; there you go. Martin Luther
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Sardisian
[1:36:36] John Wesley the Philadelphiaian church
[1:36:38] and William Brham Leodysian church.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Seven stars,
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; seven churches,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; seven church age messengers,
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; a messenger to each age. And as I was
[1:36:52] saying earlier, those light to each age,
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; but we're not walking in Paul's light.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Or we are going to stay in Ireius
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; or Martin Luther, justification,
[1:37:05] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:37:07] Ghost. See, if you stay in each one of
[1:37:09] those, you refuse light.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:37:15] Paul was the first messenger. And I'm
[1:37:17] sorry I'm so ready, but bear with me.
[1:37:20] first messenger. And he said to the
[1:37:22] Galatians in 1:8, he said, "And if any
[1:37:25] angel, any messenger, any viker, no
[1:37:28] matter who he is, if he preacheth any
[1:37:31] other gospel than what Paul preached,
[1:37:34] let him be accursed."
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Paul knew that after he was
[1:37:39] after he was gone, grievous wolves would
[1:37:42] come in. He knew that Satan himself
[1:37:45] could appear as an angel of that light.
[1:37:48] So, so how much more his ministry? So,
[1:37:52] he warns that this gospel would always
[1:37:56] be the same. Now, Paul had baptized in
[1:37:59] the na in Jesus' name and rebaptized
[1:38:03] uh and rebaptized where people had been
[1:38:07] had not been immersed.
[1:38:10] and he set the church in order and
[1:38:12] taught the proper you proper use of the
[1:38:14] gifts of the spirit to confirm that they
[1:38:18] were to remain in the church till Jesus
[1:38:21] came. I'm going to reread that. And he
[1:38:24] set the church in order and he taught
[1:38:26] the proper use of the gifts of the
[1:38:29] spirit and to confirm that they were to
[1:38:31] remain in the church till Jesus came.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; To remain in the church till Jesus came.
[1:38:38] All right.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; He never took that light away from you.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; He never took any of that away from you.
[1:38:44] What Jesus did, you can do.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; He never took that away. He said, "I'm
[1:38:49] going to give that to the little bit
[1:38:51] just I'm going to give them to him for a
[1:38:53] No, he didn't." He said, "Until Jesus
[1:38:55] came."
[1:38:58] Thus the next messenger and all
[1:39:00] remaining six
[1:39:02] would by the same Holy Ghost burn with
[1:39:05] the same fire and give that same light
[1:39:08] of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the
[1:39:11] signs would follow them. Did Ireus
[1:39:14] qualify? Yes, he did. Did Martin
[1:39:16] qualify? Yes. Did Columba? Yes. Did
[1:39:19] Martin Luther? And most assuredly did
[1:39:22] Wesley. And now he didn't put his name
[1:39:24] here, but I'm going to say it. Did
[1:39:25] Brother Brandham. We can say yes.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; And he had a great ministry and even
[1:39:34] prayed for for his horse. I'm sorry.
[1:39:37] This he was speaking about Wesley at
[1:39:39] this point did and prayed for his horse
[1:39:41] and to get well and it did. And there
[1:39:44] you are. Seven church ages, seven
[1:39:46] messengers who were alike. Paul
[1:39:49] pronounced a curse on anyone who said
[1:39:52] they was a messenger but had a different
[1:39:55] gospel and lived in a different light.
[1:39:57] That's
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; See, if anyone comes speaking anything
[1:40:01] other than this word right here,
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; let them be accursed.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; See, they were a light to each and every
[1:40:09] age, a light to walk in.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; You are a light. You are a
[1:40:13] representation. Amen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; See, Abraham, they would say, he would
[1:40:16] say, God would say, "Number the sands on
[1:40:18] the sea." You can't.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But he said, "When you number the stars
[1:40:21] in the sky, that's you. That's me."
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; He's calling out a gentile bride.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; You're a reflection of Jesus Christ. And
[1:40:28] this day, you are those stars. When
[1:40:31] Abraham looked up to the stars of the
[1:40:32] sky, he seen you.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; He couldn't number you. He didn't know
[1:40:37] how far you'd come, how many nations you
[1:40:39] come from, how far you'd come to be
[1:40:41] drawn to this light.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; But he said, "You are the light.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; You are the light to this last age."
[1:40:47] Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; See, for some yet we did sometimes we
[1:40:51] did walk in darkness, but now you are
[1:40:53] the light of the Lord. Walk as children
[1:40:56] of the light. Let's stand at this time.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[1:41:04] who will you show light to?
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Now, don't be like a spotlight and blind
[1:41:10] people with this message.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; You got them.
[1:41:17] You live like Jesus lived.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; You bring a revelation.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; There's a message. There's a word of the
[1:41:27] Lord.
[1:41:29] You shine this light.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to a city. I'm going to a
[1:41:35] promised land.
[1:41:38] There shall be no night there
[1:41:41] and no need of candle,
[1:41:44] neither light of the sun.
[1:41:47] For the Lord God giveth
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; them light.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; That's where we're heading.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; We're heading for that city where he is
[1:42:01] the light of the world.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; We'll worship him forever.
[1:42:07] We will not be in darkness. There'll be
[1:42:09] no darkness there.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's that light.
[1:42:18] Let's
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; just bow our heads this evening.
[1:42:26] Dear heavenly father, Lord,
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for this evening.
[1:42:32] We thank you for this revealed word in
[1:42:35] this last day,
[1:42:38] God. A calling out of a bride, a gentile
[1:42:41] bride.
[1:42:43] Lord, we can all say this evening that
[1:42:45] we were in darkness.
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:48] Our lives were so decrepit,
[1:42:51] so unshapely formed.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, we was in dark places.
[1:42:58] But Lord, we're so thankful that you
[1:43:00] came by our way.
[1:43:03] You called us out of that darkness into
[1:43:06] new light.
[1:43:10] Lord God, I thank you.
[1:43:12] Lord, for these people here, this bride
[1:43:15] here,
[1:43:17] God, I thank you for what you've done
[1:43:19] for them.
[1:43:21] Lord, here at Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:43:23] Tabernacle,
[1:43:25] we are a lighthouse on a hill,
[1:43:29] shining men, ladies to you,
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] Lord. We don't want to be a reflection
[1:43:38] or a glare. We want to be the light,
[1:43:43] Lord, shining until you come.
[1:43:47] Now God, I ask you that you'll just
[1:43:48] continue to make this word manifested in
[1:43:51] each and every one of our hearts
[1:43:52] tonight, God.
[1:43:55] God, if there be somebody under the
[1:43:57] sound of my voice that says, "I'm
[1:43:59] walking in darkness
[1:44:02] and I want a way out."
[1:44:07] You can walk in the light this evening
[1:44:08] because he's here.
[1:44:12] You could just raise your hands and say,
[1:44:14] "God, I thank you.
[1:44:19] Lord, you've lifted the burdens of our
[1:44:21] life off of us.
[1:44:23] You've shown us what we can be
[1:44:26] to grow in you, God.
[1:44:30] Oh Lord, we thank you.
