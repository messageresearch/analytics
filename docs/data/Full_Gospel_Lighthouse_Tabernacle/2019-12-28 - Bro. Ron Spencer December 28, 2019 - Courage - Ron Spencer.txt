group of people that love the Lord with all of their hearts and Lord we ask you now that you would touch all the needs of our people there serve all that are traveling even this weekend and we ask you to to be with them and I pray that you would just come now as we settle ourselves towards the word that we've been preparing for for now weeks with this subject Lord I even asked today Lord just just train my thought into exactly what you have for me to say may you anoint this audience as well as you would anoint me this evening and Lord we welcome you here Lord come to our pew even now strengthen even those that will hear this service this afternoon touch them in a mighty way we pray that you do a supernatural work for us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask you amen and amen and amen god bless you if you will turn with me to Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 1 verse 5 this is quite a transition between Moses and Joshua Joshua has left the scene or Moses has left the scene and Joshua has is now having to step in the realm as leader and and that's quite a quite and it's been used in a lot of different ways and I just want to look at this just for a moment you have it's a man there's some not any man a lion I like that statement there's so not any man I'd like for you to say it with me there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life for as I was with Moses so I will be with thee remember this is what God also taught brother branham I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage for under this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou must observe to do all a quarter too according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayst prosper whether so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayst observe to do according to all that is written therein for then shalt thou that make thy way prosperous and then shalt thou have good success notice these words God's going to remind them again have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God swifty weather so ever thou goest I'd like for us to read that verse again verse nine have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whether so ever thou goest you may be seated and may the Lord bless the reading his word this evening Deuteronomy chapter 31 in verse 8 I love this I love this verse and the Lord he it is that death go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed quite a powerful scripture God already knows the way that you're going to go he's already in your tomorrow he's already in your next week you and I don't know what tomorrow holds are you with me but God's already there God is not surprised where the Nathanael of what's going on in your life he's not surprised at what's going on in our lives he is already there I need you meet a quote for that he is the same yesterday today and forever he is an I am God he has not diminished one little bit when he saves the worst sinner in the world that's not diminish his grace not when he heals there was a sickest person that it looks like it's totally impossible does not diminish his healing power in it that's enough to shout about let me just share some words with you I've been sick before but I made it I've been broke before but I made it I've been brokenhearted before but I made it I cried all night but I made it I've been betrayed but I made it I've been loud on but I made it I've been destitute but I made it I've been rejected but I made it whether you know it or not you have just done something very supernatural when you walked into this build and took your seat and sit down Satan has done everything he can to stop you in your life and you're still here hallelujah I don't you across this audience tonight go I'm still here I'm still here brother Graham quotes this must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of these all of us fought to win the prize and sail through bloody seas I must fight if I must reign increase my courage Lord I sent this to some of you this week and I'll send it to brother Aaron Oglesby this week and his family I'd like to share this with you something that just seemed to to speak to my heart be still and know that I'm God I'm bigger than your problem I'm bigger than your circumstance I'm bigger than your situation this is not your battle so you don't have to handle this God will work it out all you have to do is be still and know that I am God I love that I love that don't you I'd like to preface this with tonight as we prepare as I as I begin to step into this sermon sometimes storms come and you can't see them coming the interesting thing with our Doppler radar and and the radar systems that we've got now for a weather we generally know a day or two in advance storms in the mid in the end the south and the Midwest the tornadoes they they sometimes pop up and give great problems and kill many but sometimes they can give them a warning just in advance that's a Christian sometimes you can feel it coming sometimes you can't feel it coming storms in your life come and let me just remind you sometimes we look at people that are great in the scriptures and think well how did they ever make it there were no halos over their heads there was no wings on nobody's back they were human beings just like you but they answered the challenge they was predestinated to stand the test Shadrach Meshach and Abednego were three brothers the gospel and the reason that their names roll off of our lips is because they had courage and they stood in the test of the storm they come their way are you with me we don't know anything about what kind of work that they did we don't know anything about their their grass families all we know is when the tests come they said we won't bend and we both bow and everybody else around them bend and bowed and it looked like the political thing to do and they were worshipping an idol that was made to look like the Prophet but they knew God said don't worship nobody but me are you with me so they was going to do and take what God said the threats came we'll make the furnace seven times hotter did that disturb them whatsoever courage came courage comes in a lot of forms courage comes in the heat of a battle courage comes for a doctor to look at your case and say I'm going to help you parents sometimes strikes you and you're in your heart to where when you've been given horrible news Craig's raise us up are you with me brother Ron but I've always be able to stand brother Brandon even look at his baby laying there the Flies are all over it it's dying it's getting ready to be put into its mother's arms and the devil test testing enemies ears ears telling that God don't love him brother branham even says that he was not ready to give up and then something on the inside of him let me just tell you tonight you would quit if you could there come spots that's overwhelming more than you can in your energies and in your fortitude and in your determination but God gives you courage in the moment Jobe would say and I'd say Jobe had more problems than any of us in this building but it was for an example finally he'd come to a spot though God's laymen though God's labor no matter what everybody else does to me though God's laymen get out trust him I'm preparing to go to brother brother towns brother Bissell's to to speak next weekend and look back a few years ago about 12 years ago standing and they're meeting in 2007 I believe was the witness convention and I was standing in that meeting and I was asked to speak on Saturday night I believe it was and got a lay on my heart the passion of our revival and as I stood there God just kept laying it into my heart that devil can't touch you until he first gets permission from God and as I was dancing across the platform I said the devil can't touch a hair of my head until he gets permission from God [Applause] in less than four weeks time I'll be laying in a coma does it make me afraid to quote God now let me just say this seems the same text tonight he can't touch a hair in my head until he gets permission from my father my father knows tomorrow he knows when I'll go through tomorrow he knows what he'll go through next week he knows what you go through are you with me when I come to a pulpit to speak the sermon I realized that I'm speaking part of my life when they come to a pulpit I know God's got some things in his heart a few weeks ago you were giving a sermon don't worry you were given a sermon don't worry God had laid that on my heart and then brother Kelly couldn't come and so I stood in this pulpit and I preached a sermon on don't worry and then brother Jeff and sister Anna got a picture for me Jesus in the midst of the storm are you insulin and here I'm standing here preaching to you on courage how much more than we need to be told over and over again that we have God with us and if we've got got with us if we've got got with us come hell or high water having God with you is better than the president a dictator or any any army when you got caught with you you can't lose sometimes we walk into a doctor's office not not knowing what he's going to tell you brother harun I want to speak this to you now I want to say this to you regardless of what the doubt the doctor tells you whether it's some debilitating disease or some condition that seems phenomenal to where you can't handle God's already saw it are you with me no matter what the doctor tells you the Scriptures been given to us whose report whose report do you believe are you with me to not yes I've got an agenda for preaching this and I thought tonight I I would talk on faith for a little bomb but the RAM says just build up a Christian faith I found out that one of the greatest hindrance into the church as to death God today is that they're scared to death what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you'll just only realize who you are you don't know who you are you don't know who it is sitting next to you and you say oh yeah that's my neighbor I know I know him right well but he's a son of God adopted by Jesus Christ into the family that's a daughter of God sitting next to you and who are you if you're a Christian believer you're a son and daughter of God what he gets scared about know neither being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right there in spiritual amnesia not knowing who you are there but knowing who you are produces faith Jesus had perfect faith cause he knew that he was a who he was the word perfect faith cast out all fear god is love and perfect love casts out all fear love and faith is the same thing love perfect love casts out all fear and it gives us faith Oh hallelujah Paul said that the word that came in power as well as as a voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword he went into the consciousness of men and like a surgeon's knife that cut out all the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early believers went they were preaching the gospel the word and God confirmed the word within science following the sick were healed devils were cast out they spoke with new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians I want to read that one more time the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians can you quote that that last sentence I just gave to your neighbor just now while you was wondering about something else can you quote that last sentence I just gave you because I want you to get this tonight the word has never failed in the mouth a believe us now tell your neighbor again I want you to tell him I'm a believer even in Jesus's day even in Jesus's day they said if you'd had only been here my brother wouldn't have died but God already had control of tomorrow lasses had a dinner date with Jesus tomorrow John 12 tells us that God already had John 12 it was already written in God's mind yet today he said he's he's talking with Abraham and Jacob and Sarah and all of them in another dimension but when Jesus comes and their faith was already saying if you have always been here I breath awaiting the DAAD Jesus new tomorrow he's going to eat with me how are you the word has never failed in the mouths of believing Christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word Rock o little flock you lure minority hold on to the word fill your mouth with and your heart with it and someday God will give you the kingdom are you with me now huh First Samuel Chapter 17 in verse 4 I'm gonna read some of these things for you and forgive me for the length of it and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose height was six cubits and a span and it had a helmet of brass upon his head in his arm with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass it did amazing that the devil wants you to think he's so big as a matter of fact he'll make sure that it's documented how big he is and how Mahankali is and how much his his a garments way and God already knows I've got a boy I've got a boy that's gonna fight you I don't know exactly what a slingshot weighs but it's got a long string on it and when he swirls that thing it makes kind of a singing noise that's what brother Graham said he said when he got the world and that thing is started making Michael sing the noise that's why singing in this building is so important [Music] come on church that anuya verse 8 and he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel said unto them why are you come out and sit in your battling armed array and not I for listening and you servants of Saul choose you a man and let him come down to me as long as David could not hear him let me say it as long as David could not hear him Goliath could have did that for years he's gonna stood there for years and held them at bay but as soon as David heard him David said who is that uncircumcised Felicity he's a boy we're not really really accurate with his age but he's a boy he's not a champion by their estimation but he's already had some incredible victories and before he goes to victories he goes and begins to talk to a backslidden soul who should have been the man that stepped out there but he didn't have the courage there's a major difference in a man that's got the courage and the man that don't I've got the courage in this day that keeps standing what this one failed and that one failed and this one failed and that one fell and this one's not here and that was not here don't matter don't matter don't matter to me none I'm still standing verse 40 says that he took a staff in his hand and he chose him five smooth stones now we know the story because we we've got history one was for Goliath and the rest was for his brothers so he wasn't going to be world in the stone just to be world in the stone one was the glass and four was for his brother house so don't pick up stones just to be picking up stones he wasn't God called us to be champions of laodicea and sometimes you got to pick up your stone you got to pick it up you got to pick it up it takes courage to go down to the brook and pick it up when there's nobody else walking with you let me just say this you he wasn't concerned about where they were gonna bury him he wasn't concerned about what they were going to put on his gravesite he wasn't concerned about none of that he was concerned about how I'm gonna carry his head back up on top of this hill it wasn't a sword plus the sling it was slang with rocks inside of it and when he be in the world that that wind begin to give him courage and he was listening to the Claridge and he knew in just a few moments while that man was laughing intimidating and making fun of him in a few minutes when I turn this loose you're gonna bring your last breath [Applause] big fella you have ate your last breakfast you have poacher you have put your armor on the last time the people that worship you and thought you were some great champion are not gonna think that after today - your last go ahead and tell your enemy that take dominion over you in the name of Jesus Christ not some dainty little oh god that just walks into a church we're wires the run I thought Christians were quiet you know meek and you know kind of soft well you must be from a different part of heaven and us I come from the part that's ready to fight matthew call me other day a honey badger he said if you're an angel you're a honey batter back your angel cuz you're ready at a moment's notice somebody told me the other day that me and brother Tim Pruett make good team members because we really like to know how to fight well let me just say this you you don't want a preacher that's scared you don't want to preach of the scared Philip the devil right square in the face and kill him to go back where he came from [Applause] brother on you need one of those bands what would Jesus do well let me just quote Jesus here this spot then this is not my kingdom if they're lies my kingdom my servants would come and fight he was Latin Pilate knows if it wasn't for my father given you Authority you wouldn't touch a hair of my head but I'm on a mission Ron Spencer needs to be saved and you can't stop it [Applause] how could not stop Jesus from his mission hallelujah let me relax here for a minute the Lord is my light and my salvation Psalms 27 let's just get it let's just get it that's it to get to work right here whom shall I feel the Lord is the strength of my life shall I be afraid you guys ought to meet some of the most fierce people in on the planet the devil in his kingdom down there when he assigns one of you a bad day they ought to report back to old Lucifer himself and say please don't send me there run run that's way off a cater you hear other preachers say that but what about you what about believing that about yourself the great patriarch woke up one morning and the devil was standing at the bottom of his bed he just simply said oh it's you and rolled over and went back to sleep when the wicked even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and failed and though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not feel the war should rise let me against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to enquire and he's simple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion and the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me up on a rock and now I'll show mine head be lifted up above mine enemies around about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord we stop there are many times but I want to carry that scripture on tonight here O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy upon me and answer me when thou seekest my leave my face and my heart said unto thee thy face Lord will I seek not that face far from me put not by serving away in anger for thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me O God of my salvation when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way O Lord and lead me in a plain path because of my enemies deliver me not over to the will of up mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me since its breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord and be of good courage when is he saying when his mama never forsaken God won't forsake him when it comes to a spot to where he would faint and he don't have energy to hold himself up I believed to see the goodness of the Lord wait on the Lord and be of good courage he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord Psalms 91 if you'll read there with me some 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge I've heard that scripture or quoted up thousand times one reason is because it's my favorite scripture and another reason I want you to get it he is your refuge when you can't get me my phone when you can't get me my text you can always get Jesus are you with me now are you with me now I will say of the Lord he is my refuge my fortress my god in him while I trust surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the falen from the noise of the pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings thou shalt trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor the destruction that wasteth at noonday a Thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the Lord which is my fruit refuge the most high thou habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all when you were reckon the other day brother Josh in that truck and the other man was wrecking and you was in the back angels was in the truck listen Satan would take your life if he could are you with me any of you that that knows me well if God decides I'm going to make a teacher out of you and that's what God has ordained you to do you're gonna pass your test in spite of yourself you got to study you got to do the right things because you cannot be a concert pianist and not study you can't break the rules this ain't abracadabra you got to study you got to study you've got to do the right thing put one foot in front of another you got to work listen listen even when it comes to being a Christian you just can't walk up in here on Saturday night and say well let's pray a little bit and I'm gonna have a revival in my heart that's gotta be going on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then when you get to church you ready for church I hear people say well I didn't get nothing out of service what did you put in well that preacher didn't hit on much if you'd have been pulling let me preach to you all he ain't got it tonight cause you ain't pullin cause you got to do your part work not careful we'll want the sound leader to come out and hit the notes exactly right and all the musicians to be exactly right for singing the songs of son bring the glory down and we just sit with their arms folded and go well I don't know if this is a good service or not maybe I should have just stayed home no better than I feel well maybe you should have this is not a spectator sport come on somebody help me preach that coming to church it's not a spectator sport well brother on I'll let you know next week whether you did a good job or not save it if that's all you got this sermon has been being molded for years get ready to preach to you and preach in Canada and preach whatever God tells me to go and preach it it's not dependent on somebody that they prayed all week long folding their arms and they got ready for church it takes courage to be a real Christian it's going to take courage to be in the rapture because everybody else is going to turn loose except for the bride it took courage to get inside of that Ark when nobody else was going and everybody was making fun it took Christ to stay in the ark when the Sun was still beaming down for day after day after day after day whether on are you sure this message is right I believe it was 100% Oh a few years ago I spoke in Switzerland what will I be remembered for as I came down through the middle aisle and I was preaching and God had laid on my heart that day to take part of it when brother Branham was standing there in Finland and he was looking around at all the same room he was looking and he and he walked away from the scene three times the angel kept told tell him to look at it people want to dispute that it's just real silly matter of fact it's stupid then he I'm gonna quote to you add a nice demon word you know why they do that cuz they stupid brother man said he walked up there and he said if this boy's not off of the ground in five minutes you called me a false prophet then brother Branham said the devil could line up every devil in hell he can line up the never devil in hell and he could not have stopped it and they remembers about the dido being here some of you couldn't understand brother gido but one of the testimonies he told and in that meeting was that the next meeting that brother Branham was that after that resurrection took place they didn't have cell phones then but word got ahead of what happened to that resurrected boy word got ahead to the next meeting and there was 12 rows of in wheelchairs that was set up in the front of the building before brother Branham even entered the pulpit he stepped through the door and took his hat off and all 12 rows shut up the devil that devil knows it's the truth in the same night brother Guido that is standing here preaching to us he tells us that when he went into Siberia he went there and he prayed for a little child that was looking for its mom and daddy to come back because some of them were war orphans and some of them had moms and dads and some of them but that place was filled and and brother guido began to pray for them that their father and their mother came back i'm preaching to you now and even then to pray for them that their mom and dad would come back and and they literally got upset with him because God so answered those prayers and then emptied that orphanage did the orphanage I find it interesting that brother guiteau's last service that he holds in Russia one of the girls from that orphanage is at the meeting and she said do you remember me how was that little girl you prayed for you know I take some things and it goes real deep to my heart that's one of the last meetings that he was in and God was just telling ghido you prayed for me as a little girl and mama come on church take courage Anna God's gonna give you a baby Sunday morning now I was in my office I was in my office there and I was milling around I'd sent by the Jeff some notes earlier that morning thank you for the for the gift and thank you all for the gifts that you gave men thank you for the gift and he send me a scripture back I don't know the time frame maybe you've got that somewhere or looked at up the difference but something stirred I was in my office while I was in my office I was I was there and I felt that come you know when he comes and in just a few moments I saw Anna coming down that aisle with a band in her hair and a brownish looking dress on and she had her hand on a baby and they're walking down there Miller on that takes some courage to speak something you can't see let me just say I can pray for it for years but once God shows it to it in a vision it tells me that God's got it on his mind [Applause] when I was looking at David he was in the hospital and had that thing around his neck and their doctor for telling me we can put him back together bones are grow back together but but he can't have children I was believing what God showed me but that little boy walking through the yard with his little finger out like that blond-haired blue-eyed and walking through the yard I was on the way how you know doing things for brother on they st. didn't start happening yesterday brother Harold my brother-in-law sitting right back there one morning I rolled up on a Tuesday morning I sit on the side of the bed and the Lord showed me his daddy he'd sing a song y'all have been down when Johnny run the pews we loved it we loved it wouldn't hurt my feelings I'd heard every night he was a celebrity in this area and God showed me him up strumming his guitar on a Sunday morning getting ready to sing and he was just standing there talking and sister Mary Betty sitting in the pew and I saw him follow it with a heart attack then I saw Mary Betty fall with a heart attack listen that's more than a premonition that's more than just a thought I wouldn't took brother Harold for dinners and I told him I said don't fear here God showed this to me he gonna take care of this situation that Sunday morning he was standing in the pulpit and he strumming his guitar and it happened and then sister Mary Betty had a heart that could it happened God raised him right back up thank God that we said under a prophet that would be honest and tell us those things that was more than a gift that was Christ himself operating in a man are you with me I'm thinking about this day today and I said
