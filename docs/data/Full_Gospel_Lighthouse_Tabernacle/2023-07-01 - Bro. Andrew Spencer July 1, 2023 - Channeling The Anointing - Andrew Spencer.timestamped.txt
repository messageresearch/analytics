[42:09] we we've gathered here year in and time
[42:12] in and week in after weekend but Lord
[42:15] there's a faithful little church here in
[42:18] Elkton Virginia that says God we need
[42:20] more of you and we would ask Lord that
[42:22] you would just come and you begin to
[42:24] move in this congregation here tonight
[42:27] Lord that you would bless them
[42:28] abundantly Lord for all of their
[42:30] energies and their times and all those
[42:33] that are on the way of the stream we
[42:34] pray your blessings be upon them as well
[42:37] father we are asking father for your
[42:40] Supernatural anointing to flow in this
[42:42] building father and take us into a
[42:44] sphere that only you could take us to
[42:46] Father we'll be careful to serve you and
[42:48] praise you give you all the glory and
[42:50] honor that is here thy name we love you
[42:52] and appreciate you tonight in the name
[42:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:57] amen if you have your Bibles this
[42:59] evening would like to look over in First
[43:01] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 and then
[43:04] down to the book of Timothy second
[43:07] Timothy chapter 3 and verse 16.
[43:11] amen
[43:15] it's brother Matthew said we want to be
[43:17] remembered in our pastor there brother
[43:18] Donnie Reagan's and ministering there
[43:21] tonight and having a prayer line for
[43:23] for all those people there so we know
[43:26] that the Lord has got special things in
[43:28] store for his children here today and
[43:30] Lauren he's a he's a he's a wonderful
[43:33] Lord and he's a he's mighty to save and
[43:36] and it's amazing to know that the god
[43:39] that that is in this room is the god
[43:40] that is all over his children and
[43:42] manifesting himself and taking care of
[43:45] them and there's not a problem too big
[43:47] and there's not a problem too small for
[43:49] him and he's a wonderful Lord and if you
[43:52] don't know him as Lord I invite you to
[43:54] know him he's a good God
[43:56] amen aren't you thankful to know him as
[43:58] Lord and savior
[44:00] as a redeemer as a friend aren't you
[44:03] happy
[44:04] amen aren't you happy tonight
[44:07] amen if you know Jesus you ought to be
[44:09] happy
[44:11] amen amen let's just look to the Lord
[44:14] tonight First Corinthians chapter 2 and
[44:16] verse 9 but as it is written I hath Not
[44:20] Seen Nor Ear heard neither hath entered
[44:24] into the heart of man the things which
[44:26] God hath prepared for them that love him
[44:29] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[44:32] his spirit for the spirit searcheth all
[44:35] things yea the Deep things of God
[44:37] for what man knoweth the things of a man
[44:39] save the spirit of man which is in him
[44:42] even so the things of God knoweth wrong
[44:45] man but the spirit of God now we have
[44:48] received not the spirit of the world but
[44:50] the spirit which is of god that we might
[44:53] know the things that are freely given
[44:56] unto us of God isn't it wonderful to
[44:58] know the things of God
[45:00] amen which things also we speak not in
[45:03] The Words which man's Wisdom teacheth
[45:06] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth
[45:08] comparing spiritual things with
[45:10] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[45:13] not the things of the spirit of God for
[45:16] they are foolishness unto him neither
[45:19] can he know them because they are
[45:22] spiritually discerned second Timothy
[45:25] chapter 3 and verse 16.
[45:31] very familiar scripture readings here
[45:33] tonight
[45:34] and Paul says that all scripture
[45:37] is given by inspiration of God
[45:40] is profitable for Doctrine for reproof
[45:43] for correction for instruction and
[45:47] righteousness that the man of God may be
[45:49] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[45:52] good works may God bless his word he may
[45:54] be seated here in the presence of the
[45:55] Lord I'd like to read that last portion
[45:58] of First Corinthians chapter 2 and 13
[46:00] that it says that which things also we
[46:03] speak not in The Words which man wisdoms
[46:07] teacheth but which the Holy Ghost
[46:09] teacheth comparing spiritual things with
[46:11] spiritual but the natural man receiveth
[46:13] not the things of the spirit of God for
[46:15] they are foolishness unto him neither
[46:17] can he know them because they are
[46:20] spiritually discerned I would like to
[46:22] speak to you tonight on the thought that
[46:24] the Lord's placed on our heart on
[46:26] channeling the inspiration channeling
[46:29] the inspiration in other words you could
[46:30] say channeling the anointing or
[46:32] channeling the word of God brother
[46:34] Branham says here in the church age book
[46:36] he said I am the word he said he said
[46:38] he's reading the scripture he said if
[46:40] you want to if you want deity in your
[46:42] midst then welcome and receive the word
[46:45] now he said don't ever let anyone or
[46:47] anything get between you and that word
[46:49] this which I am given unto you the word
[46:52] is a revelation of myself I am the word
[46:54] remember that I wonder if we are
[46:57] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[46:59] our midst let me give you a thought here
[47:01] how do we pray we pray in Jesus name
[47:05] don't we every prayer is in his name or
[47:07] there isn't any answer yet in first John
[47:10] 5 and 14 we are told that this is the
[47:13] confidence that we have in him that if
[47:15] we ask anything according to his will he
[47:18] heareth us and if we know that he hears
[47:21] us whatsoever we ask we know that we
[47:24] have the petitions that we desired of
[47:26] him now we ask what is the will of God
[47:29] there is only one way to know his will
[47:32] and that is by the word of God for
[47:35] Lamentations 3 and 37 says who is he
[47:37] that saith and it cometh to pass when
[47:41] the Lord commandeth it not he said there
[47:43] it is if it isn't in the word you can't
[47:45] have it
[47:47] can you say Amen to that if it isn't in
[47:49] the word then you can't have it so we
[47:51] ask so we can't ask in we can't ask
[47:54] unless it's in the word and we can't
[47:56] petition or ask E3 but that is exactly
[47:59] what he is John 14 and 6 I am the way
[48:02] the truth and the life Romans 8 and 9 If
[48:05] any man have not the spirit of Christ he
[48:07] is none of his there it is he is spirit
[48:10] and he is alive that is exactly what the
[48:13] word is it is exactly what Jesus is he
[48:16] is the word so when a spirit born
[48:18] Spirit-filled man in faith takes that
[48:21] word into his heart and places it upon
[48:24] his lips why it's that is the same as
[48:27] deity speaking Every Mountain has to go
[48:30] and Satan cannot stand before that man
[48:34] so if if you as a son and daughter of
[48:37] God if you are filled with the Holy
[48:39] Spirit and you watch that you watch that
[48:41] you didn't gather this knowledge you
[48:43] didn't gather this knowledge from a
[48:45] school book you didn't gather this
[48:46] knowledge from some idea but you
[48:48] gathered these things that you have have
[48:50] received you've gathered them by the
[48:52] knowledge of the Holy Ghost and it's a
[48:54] very powerful thing to say that you know
[48:57] Jesus Christ because there's a lot of
[48:58] people that talk about Jesus there's a
[49:01] lot of people that say that that they've
[49:02] heard about Jesus but to say that you
[49:04] know Jesus is a very powerful thing if
[49:07] we can introduce our young people and
[49:09] our our young girls and our little
[49:10] children here at five and six years old
[49:12] no matter how old they are if we can
[49:14] introduce them to a god that saves and
[49:17] let them know that they can know the god
[49:19] of the Bible it isn't it isn't something
[49:21] for just a minister or or for the laity
[49:24] as they grow and mature in the word but
[49:26] every single one of us can know in the
[49:28] past know him in the power of his
[49:31] resurrection but there is a power of
[49:33] knowledge that we as his children we
[49:36] begin to get under the channel of
[49:38] inspiration by by the preaching of the
[49:40] word or by the hearing of the word that
[49:42] we know that faith comes by hearing and
[49:44] how do we even recognize that Jesus
[49:46] Christ says law lord it's because that
[49:48] you heard about him if if you recognized
[49:51] him if you've accepted him if you if you
[49:53] felt him as a Healer if you've known him
[49:55] as a God that cares it's because you
[49:57] heard about him and the reason why
[49:59] you've experienced him in that level is
[50:00] because you heard about it and by faith
[50:03] in those things you begin to move into
[50:04] the operation of faith and you begin to
[50:07] channel those things and that's why
[50:08] that's why you see these young girls
[50:10] getting filled with the Holy Ghost is
[50:12] because they heard about a Holy Ghost
[50:13] and I believe if they've gone to if
[50:16] they're going to have the Holy Ghost and
[50:17] somebody's got to preach it so that they
[50:20] can hear about it so that they can
[50:21] receive it and I believe that if you
[50:23] need healing in your body then God's got
[50:25] to have somebody that'll stand there and
[50:28] preach the word of God that God is still
[50:30] a Healer so that somebody can tap into a
[50:33] channel and then they can re receive
[50:35] that inspiration as it as it whirls out
[50:37] of that world of that we don't see and
[50:39] they can receive it so I believe that if
[50:42] there's going to be powerful things
[50:44] happen in the Church of the Living God
[50:45] then we ought to be able to preach teach
[50:47] those things and I believe that if we
[50:49] can tap into one of those channels here
[50:51] tonight I believe that there will be
[50:53] Supernatural things here that'll happen
[50:55] for every person sitting here under the
[50:57] sound of our voice if we can just tap
[50:59] into a channel it's like what you're
[51:01] hearing me by tonight if you're hearing
[51:03] me by the by the help of amplification
[51:06] of these sound waves that are that are
[51:09] operating there they're going through a
[51:10] transmitter they're going through a
[51:12] transmitter that is here in this
[51:14] microphone and it's transmitted through
[51:16] a wire that sends it through there that
[51:18] sends it back to you in the perfect
[51:20] timing that you're hearing it all in the
[51:22] same time and it's a it's a powerful
[51:24] thing when you got some powerful
[51:26] microphones that can help you and you're
[51:28] you're sitting there and you're you're
[51:30] not just a you're not just a great order
[51:32] but you're standing there and you have
[51:34] to have the ability to take your voice
[51:36] above the the voice of the crowd so
[51:39] you've got you've got amplifiers you've
[51:41] got you've got microphones and you've
[51:43] got all of these transmitters that are
[51:45] taking their spot in the park of the
[51:47] operation of the preaching of the word
[51:49] you see these things could be used for
[51:51] one thing or they could be used for the
[51:54] preaching of the word and this
[51:55] microphone never knew what it was going
[51:57] to be used for but it was operating in a
[52:00] channel where somebody bought it it was
[52:02] sitting there and somebody took it and
[52:04] put it here now the pews that you're
[52:06] sitting in or the chairs that you're
[52:07] setting in they could have said in rock
[52:09] and roll concerts or or somewhere down
[52:11] the street but they're here tonight it's
[52:13] because somebody had a vision to place
[52:15] those things in this place or in this
[52:18] building so that you could have a nice
[52:20] place to set upon it's somebody that was
[52:22] getting under the vision to be able to
[52:24] grab an inspiration build a building
[52:27] have atmosphere have a have a sound wave
[52:30] and have all of these these technology
[52:32] things and these brothers up there they
[52:34] are they are key we've taught them over
[52:36] the years to how to build an atmosphere
[52:39] in this building and it's some of the
[52:41] worst things
[52:42] to fight against is an atmosphere in a
[52:45] building because you see there's things
[52:47] that are working against us in this
[52:48] building there's carpet that is working
[52:50] against us there's there's bodies
[52:52] there's 98 BTUs that are set off by
[52:54] every human being here tonight there's
[52:56] things that are against us but there's
[52:57] something that is operating that is
[53:00] controlling this the the atmosphere here
[53:02] there's there's an air condition that
[53:04] aren't you thankful for air condition
[53:06] that it's controlling the atmosphere of
[53:09] your what you feel you see you would be
[53:11] Max teaming mad if brother Alden had it
[53:13] at 85 degrees in here you'd be Fanning
[53:16] harder than anything you'd be getting
[53:18] ready to take wings and you'd be mad as
[53:20] I'll get out if I stood up here and I
[53:22] had my back to you and you couldn't hear
[53:24] what I was saying because there's
[53:26] somebody that's got to operate in a
[53:28] channel to be able to use what is being
[53:31] put out
[53:32] are you with me you see there's a major
[53:34] difference in just just saying some
[53:37] things and then there's a major
[53:38] difference and being able to build on
[53:40] top of that and there's a lot of people
[53:41] that don't understand the power of
[53:44] building an atmosphere and it's taken us
[53:46] years upon years to build an atmosphere
[53:48] and to to show these brothers and show
[53:50] these sisters how to build an atmosphere
[53:53] by the power of sound
[53:55] you see most of you don't understand
[53:57] those things because you've never
[53:58] operated in those things you see you
[54:00] don't understand what it's like to
[54:02] preach because you've never preached
[54:03] you've never understood but I don't I
[54:06] don't understand the way that you
[54:07] receive certain things because I'm not
[54:09] sitting in your shoes you see there's a
[54:11] major difference I hope you understand
[54:13] what I'm saying to you but there's a
[54:15] major difference in a singer and a
[54:17] worship leader
[54:19] because there's a lot of fine people
[54:21] that that know how to get into the
[54:23] channel of singing a fine song and know
[54:25] how to lift their voice at a certain
[54:27] level and they know how to hit all the
[54:29] keys at the right moment but there's a
[54:31] major difference in somebody that gets
[54:33] into the channel of a worship leader
[54:36] because I believe that we are past the
[54:37] days of just singing songs I believe
[54:40] we're past the days of just singing
[54:42] songs that that sound good they have
[54:44] nice lyrics but I don't want to sing
[54:46] songs that don't have no meaning to them
[54:48] I want to sing a song that that a puppet
[54:51] God knows how he comes down and gets in
[54:54] the midst of the children's Praises as
[54:56] they begin to lift up and they begin to
[54:58] get in the channel of worship they get
[55:00] under the inspiration of that song and
[55:03] it takes them from the world that
[55:04] they're living in into the world that
[55:06] God's calling them and it takes a very
[55:08] special built man to be able to work
[55:11] into that inspiration you see you might
[55:13] see us up here and we're operating
[55:15] through song books that we're operating
[55:16] through our iPads and looking over songs
[55:19] while the preaching of the word is going
[55:20] forth what are we doing we're trying to
[55:23] build a little Ministry after the
[55:25] preaching of the word and we get into a
[55:27] Channel of it
[55:28] we get into a Channel of it we don't
[55:30] want to just sing some song that just
[55:32] because it's got the right words or it's
[55:34] got the right tune we want to sing a
[55:37] song that matches the inspiration of the
[55:40] preaching of the Lord
[55:41] it's like brother Joel taught brother
[55:43] Joel foreign he told me one time he's
[55:45] one of the key elements in teaching me
[55:46] how to be a worship leader he told us he
[55:49] was telling me one time he said I was
[55:51] preaching he said I was preaching at
[55:52] this place and he said the spirit of the
[55:54] Lord was coming down in a very powerful
[55:56] way and you could see that the Lord was
[55:58] leading it to an altar calling I mean
[56:00] there you begin to see the spirit of the
[56:02] Lord begin to work on this brother or
[56:04] that sister and then all of a sudden the
[56:06] song leader got up there and said I
[56:07] wouldn't start at singing I wouldn't
[56:09] take nothing for my journey now and it
[56:11] broke the atmosphere of the calling of
[56:14] the altar call
[56:15] you see you've got to have somebody that
[56:18] moves into the channel of the
[56:20] inspiration
[56:22] because there's somebody that's upstairs
[56:25] that's riding up the Keynotes and you
[56:28] may not understand that if you've ever
[56:29] looked at sheet music you may not
[56:31] understand what it says but somebody
[56:33] that's trained to it that somebody
[56:35] that's looked at it before somebody that
[56:37] studied those things they look at it and
[56:39] they can understand what kind of keynote
[56:41] that it's bringing forth or what the
[56:43] lead note is you'll watch somebody if
[56:46] you take that sheet music it's got two
[56:48] dots and then it's got a cleft note and
[56:50] all of those things I could tell you
[56:51] maybe what one or two of them things but
[56:53] sister Cassie that's operating in that
[56:55] channel knows all of those things she
[56:57] can tell you exactly what they mean
[57:00] and I can tell you the same things that
[57:02] I'm preaching right now I could take
[57:04] this same word preach it down in a
[57:06] Baptist church and they wouldn't catch
[57:08] any inspiration that I'm preaching to
[57:09] them because they don't understand the
[57:11] channel that I'm operating in you see if
[57:14] you're going to receive anything from
[57:15] God you've got to get in the right
[57:17] channel of things you can't just get
[57:19] over here and say well Lottie doll I'm
[57:21] gonna be over here today but you got to
[57:23] get in the same inspiration
[57:26] that's the one that wrote the word the
[57:28] one that knows the word
[57:31] foreign
[57:32] there's a whole lot there's a whole lot
[57:33] of power laying right there if you can
[57:35] really just capture it because I know
[57:36] that a lot of you love songs you you
[57:38] wake up listening to it but if you can
[57:40] really get into the channel of a song
[57:42] that's why I've told our choirs that's
[57:44] why I've told our young people don't get
[57:46] behind this pulpit and sing a song Just
[57:48] because it means something or it has
[57:50] good words sing the song
[57:53] that's got power behind it and it means
[57:55] something to you because if the song
[57:57] don't mean nothing to you
[57:59] it won't come out
[58:01] the power that needs to come behind it
[58:08] that's like me getting up here trying to
[58:10] tell you about how the universe was
[58:12] created and how everything all comes
[58:14] together and all the cosmic light and
[58:16] everything I couldn't tell you how all
[58:18] those things can come together so I
[58:20] wouldn't be preaching to you something
[58:21] that I absolutely know but if I can
[58:24] preach to you John 3 16 if I can preach
[58:26] to you Acts 2 38 I know what I'm talking
[58:29] about
[58:32] now I can't take your job and you can't
[58:34] take mine you don't want me working on
[58:36] electricity because I will get into a
[58:38] channel and I will shock somebody or I
[58:41] blow them up
[58:43] I can guarantee you that if you have
[58:45] been electrician or something like that
[58:47] I'm going to get some wires crossed but
[58:49] you get me in the right channel that I'm
[58:51] built for
[58:53] I hope you hear what I'm saying to you
[58:55] tonight if you can get in to the channel
[58:57] that the Lord has built you for you can
[58:59] operate where God is destined you to
[59:01] operate in
[59:02] you don't see it operating in this room
[59:04] tonight but there is an atmosphere here
[59:06] that you can't see
[59:08] you know good and well that television
[59:10] is operating right here in this room but
[59:12] it takes a special design a channel to
[59:15] be able to grasp it it takes something
[59:17] with the right dial and the right lights
[59:19] and all of those care those little
[59:22] details that brings to pass the waves
[59:25] that are passing through this room right
[59:27] here you see I could tell these brothers
[59:29] to post a picture and they could simply
[59:32] go post it up on there go ahead and post
[59:34] that picture uh what I sent you this
[59:37] week about William Bradham being out
[59:38] there in Harrisonburg
[59:40] laughs
[59:43] which is brother brother Wayne Lawson
[59:46] shared that with us this week I spent
[59:47] hours I spent countless hours looking
[59:49] for news articles about William Brandon
[59:52] being in Harrisonburg but because
[59:53] somebody tapped into a channel they was
[59:56] able to find it in them in the in the in
[59:58] the in the magazine of Herald of Faith
[1:00:00] which Jack Moore put out there you see
[1:00:02] what you don't recognize I simply just
[1:00:04] spoke the word
[1:00:06] I said Brothers post that up there and
[1:00:08] there it was
[1:00:11] but you don't recognize that even right
[1:00:13] here right now that if you could say God
[1:00:15] I'm in need of my healing it can happen
[1:00:18] faster than that happened right there
[1:00:22] and maybe you don't understand what
[1:00:24] channel I'm trying to get you in
[1:00:26] but if I can get you in the channel of
[1:00:28] believing there is nothing that is
[1:00:30] impossible against the Church of the
[1:00:32] Living God
[1:00:34] you see you're built to be able to tap
[1:00:36] into a dimension that you can't see you
[1:00:39] see that television it works through a
[1:00:41] channel and it operates and it goes out
[1:00:43] there and it grabs and it manifests and
[1:00:46] the reason why I know that the spirit of
[1:00:47] the Living God is here is because I see
[1:00:50] that the Eagles are gathered here
[1:00:53] and if there's Eagles here that means
[1:00:55] that there's a carcass here and if
[1:00:56] there's a caucus here that means there's
[1:00:58] a word here and if there's a word here
[1:01:00] that means the impossibilities are in
[1:01:03] the same room
[1:01:04] it means that you are operating in a
[1:01:07] realm
[1:01:09] that all things are possible now notice
[1:01:12] what brother Branham says here said in
[1:01:13] that fourth dimension he said people can
[1:01:15] prove that right through this room now
[1:01:17] is coming radioactivity radio message
[1:01:19] coming right through this building now
[1:01:21] as coming televisions pictures but it's
[1:01:23] it's too fast for our eyes now you go a
[1:01:26] million miles beyond that Dimension and
[1:01:28] you'll get into a place that's just as
[1:01:30] real as television pictures is in this
[1:01:32] room this morning there's the Lord Jesus
[1:01:34] Christ the resurrected Son of God
[1:01:36] standing there and he said and the
[1:01:38] reason you can't see him is because our
[1:01:40] heart hasn't become tuned down to it and
[1:01:43] he said and the reason we can't see
[1:01:45] television pictures it's because our
[1:01:47] bodies are not set as instruments to
[1:01:49] pick up the mechanical scent things
[1:01:52] now you know good and well that that
[1:01:53] television right there is built to pick
[1:01:55] up that thing
[1:01:58] but if I told you to manifest it in your
[1:02:00] body you couldn't do it because you're
[1:02:02] not built for it
[1:02:04] he said but when our bodies become in
[1:02:06] tune with God and become a part of him
[1:02:09] then our soul can pick up the power of
[1:02:11] the Holy Spirit to vindicate that the
[1:02:14] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ is in
[1:02:17] all of his power and his omnipotence so
[1:02:19] if you can get your heart right you can
[1:02:22] pick up the supernatural right here
[1:02:25] if you can get your heart right there
[1:02:27] are things that your soul picks up it's
[1:02:30] like when no Philip found Nathanael a
[1:02:32] player when he found him up as he was
[1:02:34] coming down he said that he said look
[1:02:36] man he said we have found the one that
[1:02:38] Moses told us about we found him who the
[1:02:41] law and the prophets and all them told
[1:02:43] us about he said how can there be any
[1:02:46] good thing that comes out of nazarus and
[1:02:48] Philip just simply said these words come
[1:02:51] and see and when he was standing before
[1:02:52] Jesus he said on Nazarite and whom there
[1:02:56] is no God and he said which did you know
[1:02:58] me Lord he said why do you call me Lord
[1:03:01] just because of these things he said but
[1:03:03] because you believe you're going to see
[1:03:05] greater things than this
[1:03:08] he said you're going to see Angels
[1:03:09] ascending and descending upon the son of
[1:03:12] man what was it nathanael's Faith tapped
[1:03:15] into a sphere that they saw that there
[1:03:17] was going to come forth greater things
[1:03:20] brother random said he said if you've
[1:03:22] just accepted Christ by justification
[1:03:24] and accept sanctification and clean up
[1:03:26] your life he said you're still smoking
[1:03:28] Watch What Happens how much different
[1:03:30] you look back to sanctification you was
[1:03:33] just standing and just Justified and
[1:03:35] never received the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:36] Ghost he said but you step into that
[1:03:38] sphere then look back down at the rest
[1:03:40] of it he said you just keep walking till
[1:03:43] after a while you're going to get so
[1:03:45] light that you can walk up into the
[1:03:47] rapture
[1:03:48] you see what it is the Holy Ghost will
[1:03:51] take you to the realm that you're built
[1:03:53] for
[1:03:54] there's some children cannot feed upon
[1:03:57] the same level that you mature
[1:03:58] Christians are feeding on tonight but
[1:04:00] the Holy Ghost knows how to give
[1:04:02] inspiration to everyone sitting here
[1:04:05] tonight
[1:04:07] it's amazing to see where where the
[1:04:10] spirit of the Lord can take a man of God
[1:04:12] that he can take a man of God and he can
[1:04:14] operate and somebody will say man that
[1:04:16] was the most powerful paragraph or the
[1:04:18] most little simple word that brother
[1:04:20] Andrew said it was exactly what I was
[1:04:23] needing for the moment that when I was
[1:04:24] in and then there'll be somebody said
[1:04:26] man I know it wasn't for nobody else
[1:04:28] back there
[1:04:29] it was for me
[1:04:31] you see what it is it's the inspiration
[1:04:33] of the one that's writing the word that
[1:04:35] knows how to bring it to the people and
[1:04:37] the needs that they're in
[1:04:41] all right now because we recognize that
[1:04:43] the Bible says that all scripture is
[1:04:45] given by inspiration of God if you go to
[1:04:48] studying that out in the Greek it means
[1:04:50] that he divinely that all scripture is
[1:04:53] divinely breathed in if you go to
[1:04:55] studying it out you'll look that it's
[1:04:57] the same word that is used when he
[1:04:59] breathed the very Breath of Life in the
[1:05:02] in into Adam's nostrils there in the
[1:05:05] Garden of Eden that he breathed the very
[1:05:07] Breath of Life on the inside of him and
[1:05:10] William Branham said don't you know that
[1:05:12] the church is born by the very breath of
[1:05:15] almighty God
[1:05:17] you are born by the very inspiration of
[1:05:20] the Holy Ghost he said the true
[1:05:22] Pentecostal church is born of the Breath
[1:05:25] of God you remember when Jesus is
[1:05:27] standing there in John chapter 20 and he
[1:05:29] said my peace I give unto you he said as
[1:05:32] my father sent me even so I sin die you
[1:05:35] and as he had said those sayings he
[1:05:38] breathed on them and he said receive ye
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost but you see they gathered
[1:05:43] the inspiration and they went up there
[1:05:45] after he said in Acts 1 and 8 that
[1:05:48] you're going to be a witness unto myself
[1:05:49] and they went up there and got the
[1:05:52] inspiration in an upper room what was it
[1:05:55] he breathed prophecy over their life
[1:06:00] breathe prophecy over their life and
[1:06:03] they gathered the inspiration
[1:06:06] and it's amazing what William Branham
[1:06:08] stood here and he preached over this
[1:06:11] congregation
[1:06:16] me and brother William was just talking
[1:06:17] about it before service and because I
[1:06:19] showed you that little that little clip
[1:06:21] it's been on my heart you think about
[1:06:24] these these meetings that happened right
[1:06:26] here in Harrisonburg Virginia
[1:06:28] you think about all of the people that
[1:06:30] turned a message down
[1:06:33] you think about the churches that all
[1:06:35] came together under under that Healing
[1:06:37] Ministry they came there they've seen
[1:06:39] those things they they seen the
[1:06:40] manifestation of the Holy ghostly seen
[1:06:42] great powerful things but none of them
[1:06:44] churches cooperated and they never
[1:06:46] stayed in line but there was a seed
[1:06:49] planted
[1:06:50] and because there was a seed planted
[1:06:52] somebody is sitting here today there's a
[1:06:55] church here in Elkton Virginia that
[1:06:57] believes that there's a message of
[1:06:58] Malachi 4 that has turned our hearts
[1:07:01] back to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:07:02] fathers and because there was an
[1:07:04] inspiration because God deposited a gene
[1:07:08] seed of God on the inside of the Church
[1:07:10] of the Living God the reason why you're
[1:07:12] here today is because God dropped
[1:07:14] inspiration
[1:07:16] Hallelujah out there when nobody else
[1:07:18] wanted to do anything with him nobody
[1:07:21] else wanted anything to do with this
[1:07:22] message after he got outside of 1963
[1:07:26] they saw they said William Adams got off
[1:07:28] of his rock party went off on the deep
[1:07:31] end but they didn't recognize what he
[1:07:33] was breaking into he was breaking into
[1:07:35] our inspiration
[1:07:37] the rest of the world don't want nothing
[1:07:38] to do with this message but we want
[1:07:40] everything in the world to do with it
[1:07:42] see the world calls it crazy the world
[1:07:45] calls us neurotics but the people that
[1:07:47] have inspiration
[1:07:49] are those that are called Crazy by the
[1:07:51] rest of the world it's well I don't know
[1:07:53] if I can stand this or not Jesus had to
[1:07:55] stand criticism they called him a
[1:07:57] neurotic they called him crazy they
[1:08:00] called John the Baptist a wild man but
[1:08:02] we are under the greatest inspiration
[1:08:05] that's ever been deposited since Jesus
[1:08:08] Christ is here and we're living in a
[1:08:10] special hour where we're coming and
[1:08:12] taking the book
[1:08:13] we're not just the people we're not just
[1:08:16] another gathering of people we are the
[1:08:19] inspiration of the hour
[1:08:21] and God has got Sons and Daughters of
[1:08:23] God that have gathered under the
[1:08:26] inspiration of the word and they believe
[1:08:29] hallelujah hallelujah wasn't just for
[1:08:32] William Branham it wasn't just for those
[1:08:34] early Decades of people that were
[1:08:36] sitting there it's for you
[1:08:39] it's for you and because you tapped into
[1:08:42] a channel
[1:08:44] because you said that you believe
[1:08:46] because you believe that these things
[1:08:48] are for you he takes you into a realm
[1:08:52] Hallelujah the hour that we're living in
[1:08:54] is the hour of the taking of the book
[1:09:01] Hallelujah
[1:09:03] Hallelujah
[1:09:06] what did John say in that voice which I
[1:09:09] heard from heaven in Revelations 10 8
[1:09:11] which I heard from heaven from Heaven
[1:09:14] speak unto me again and said go and take
[1:09:16] the little book which is open in the
[1:09:17] hand of the angel
[1:09:19] which standeth upon the Earth
[1:09:23] Matt get yes
[1:09:26] somebody's calling but I ain't answering
[1:09:30] they got the wrong Channel
[1:09:34] probably spam
[1:09:36] but I went into the angel said unto him
[1:09:38] give me the little book and he said take
[1:09:40] it and eat it and it shall make thy
[1:09:42] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:09:44] mouth sweet as honey and I John took the
[1:09:48] little book now what does John represent
[1:09:50] he represents the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:09:52] and I took the little book out of the
[1:09:55] Angel's hand and I ate it up and it was
[1:09:57] in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon
[1:09:59] as I had eaten it my belly was bitter
[1:10:01] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:10:04] before many peoples and Nations and
[1:10:06] tongues and Kings now if you go to
[1:10:08] studying out that word and I took the
[1:10:11] little book that took that word took in
[1:10:13] the Greek it is lambeno which means to
[1:10:16] receive it means to catch it means to
[1:10:19] take it is to take with the hand or to
[1:10:21] lay a hold off it also means to take an
[1:10:24] order to carry it away it means to claim
[1:10:26] or to procure for oneself it is the same
[1:10:30] word that is used in John 1 and 12 that
[1:10:33] as many as lambeno received him to them
[1:10:37] gave him power to become the sons of God
[1:10:39] even to them that believe on his name it
[1:10:43] is also used when Jesus is standing
[1:10:45] there in Luke chapter nine and it's
[1:10:47] getting ready to feed the multitude what
[1:10:50] was it it wasn't his bread it wasn't his
[1:10:52] fish it was somebody else's but the
[1:10:55] Bible said in verse 16 that he took the
[1:10:58] Five Loaves he received them he claimed
[1:11:01] them as his own
[1:11:05] Hallelujah he took the Five Loaves and
[1:11:08] the two fishes and looked up the heaven
[1:11:09] and he blessed them and gave to the
[1:11:11] disciples and to set it before the
[1:11:13] multitude and they did eat and they were
[1:11:16] all filled now what if Jesus didn't take
[1:11:18] them and what if Jesus didn't bless them
[1:11:21] they would have never fed the multitudes
[1:11:23] but because he took it
[1:11:25] because he took it and blessed it it fed
[1:11:28] over 5 000 people and it took up 12
[1:11:31] basketballs at the end of it what if you
[1:11:34] don't take this message you'll never be
[1:11:36] a blessed people you'll never be a
[1:11:38] special glass of people you won't be a
[1:11:40] royal priesthood you won't be a chosen
[1:11:42] generation but because you took the book
[1:11:45] because you ate the book because you
[1:11:48] became the book
[1:11:51] Hallelujah I know everybody ain't here
[1:11:54] tonight I know we're smaller number but
[1:11:55] I feel you out there tonight because
[1:11:57] there's a people that have taken the
[1:11:59] book they've ate the book they've became
[1:12:02] the book it's why we look so much like
[1:12:05] Jesus
[1:12:07] [Applause]
[1:12:08] come on somebody
[1:12:11] it might be hard for you to believe but
[1:12:13] the things that are impossible are not
[1:12:15] impossible to you because you are
[1:12:18] sitting here as a fully adopted son and
[1:12:21] daughter of God under the manifestation
[1:12:23] of the power of the sons of God you're
[1:12:26] fully adopted setting their sons and
[1:12:28] daughters of God all creation was
[1:12:31] grading was waiting for your
[1:12:32] manifestation it was groaning for your
[1:12:35] manifestation trees were groaning
[1:12:37] forward nature was growing forward but
[1:12:40] you're here
[1:12:41] you're in a special hour
[1:12:44] who lifted you up here none other than
[1:12:46] our Lord Jesus Christ who let you see
[1:12:48] what you see
[1:12:51] why can't the rest of the world see it
[1:12:53] it's because they didn't receive a
[1:12:54] channel in the name of Malachi 4. but
[1:12:57] because you received the channel you
[1:12:59] gather the inspiration of the hour that
[1:13:01] you're in
[1:13:03] well Glory it feels good to preach to a
[1:13:05] people that believe and there's a
[1:13:07] message of restoration there's a people
[1:13:09] that's been caught up come up here a
[1:13:11] little bit higher you've gathered
[1:13:13] inspiration that you look past the
[1:13:15] things of the world you look past
[1:13:17] laodicea the things that upset the rest
[1:13:19] of the world it don't upset you you've
[1:13:22] got your eyes set on the on our Lord
[1:13:24] Jesus Christ
[1:13:27] let the world go do what they're going
[1:13:29] to do we've gathered inspiration
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:36] Hallelujah
[1:13:37] you go find when Jesus is walking with
[1:13:39] us to do Disciples there
[1:13:42] they don't even know who he is at the
[1:13:44] moment
[1:13:46] but they recognize there's something
[1:13:48] powerful about him
[1:13:52] you ever been in a moment
[1:13:55] and you recognize you're in the moment
[1:13:58] these two brothers recognize that there
[1:14:00] was something special going on here
[1:14:03] when he begins to take them all the way
[1:14:04] from Moses all the way up to Modern
[1:14:07] events being made clear by prophecy he's
[1:14:09] leading them right through the word and
[1:14:11] now they're seeing it and they don't
[1:14:12] really understand who they're looking at
[1:14:14] because they ain't recognized him yet
[1:14:16] but the Bible said that they constrained
[1:14:18] him to come they they earnestly pulled
[1:14:21] on him it was like he was going to go on
[1:14:24] but because they they poured on him they
[1:14:27] constrained him and their services like
[1:14:30] this or or times and it feels like man
[1:14:32] I'm getting ready to lose my blessing
[1:14:34] I'm getting ready to miss what's getting
[1:14:35] ready to happen but because you operated
[1:14:38] in the third third pool you begin to
[1:14:40] pull on him you begin to say father come
[1:14:43] into my house
[1:14:45] you see and it looked like he was going
[1:14:47] to go on but because you pulled on him
[1:14:49] he said I'm going to tarry with you a
[1:14:51] little bit longer
[1:14:53] and the Bible said that when it came to
[1:14:56] pass that he sat down with the dinner at
[1:14:59] the evening time Hallelujah
[1:15:01] that he took the bread he he claimed it
[1:15:04] as his own and he blessed it and they
[1:15:06] immediately their eyes were opened to
[1:15:09] recognize
[1:15:13] I wasn't there to see all the great
[1:15:15] Miracles that that happened in the early
[1:15:17] ministries of William Branham I didn't
[1:15:19] see the firstborn operation I didn't see
[1:15:22] him take him by the hands and see those
[1:15:24] those bumps that the Lord allowed to
[1:15:25] operate and show that the different
[1:15:27] diseases that was operating in a
[1:15:30] person's body I never got to see those
[1:15:32] things brother Shannon but I believe it
[1:15:34] happened I didn't get to see the second
[1:15:36] pool I in operation by by the Discerning
[1:15:39] and the knowing of the secrets of the
[1:15:40] hearts I wasn't there but I am under
[1:15:43] this third pole Ministry and I
[1:15:45] understand that
[1:15:48] this is the same one this is more than a
[1:15:51] man he says more than William Branham
[1:15:53] it's somebody that is operating under
[1:15:56] the same operation of this book
[1:15:59] if it wasn't then how in the world could
[1:16:03] we make all of the message line up with
[1:16:05] this Bible of 66 books
[1:16:08] but it's the same one that wrote the
[1:16:10] word it's the same one that is writing
[1:16:13] it out in your heart
[1:16:15] that's why the Bible said that your
[1:16:16] written Epistles read of all men you are
[1:16:19] sitting here tonight some of the
[1:16:20] greatest books that people will ever
[1:16:22] read
[1:16:24] a lot of these people today don't even
[1:16:27] know who Jesus is
[1:16:28] a lot of these people today ain't never
[1:16:30] picked up a Bible
[1:16:34] I watched a video one time of a guy just
[1:16:36] going up and asking people if they could
[1:16:38] recite John 3 16 and some of them didn't
[1:16:40] even a lot of them didn't even know it
[1:16:41] didn't even know the start of it
[1:16:44] what is it like brother Bynum said they
[1:16:46] left him at the altar as a little child
[1:16:49] and they never picked him up again but
[1:16:51] you see when when when this nation was
[1:16:54] invaded by the power of Satan that we
[1:16:57] recognize that that this Earth that we
[1:16:59] are living in is under the inspiration
[1:17:02] of Satan just like the inspiration of
[1:17:05] Ramesses was operating in the world of
[1:17:07] Egypt but there was a Moses out there
[1:17:10] there was a Moses out there that was
[1:17:13] operating in a different channel that
[1:17:14] ramuses didn't know nothing about
[1:17:16] you see there's a lot of people that's
[1:17:18] trying to copycat the same message or
[1:17:21] this same Ministry but they'd never been
[1:17:23] able to it because they can't gather the
[1:17:24] inspiration of it but the one that is
[1:17:27] setting here that is said that all
[1:17:29] scripture is given by the very Breath of
[1:17:32] God why are you sitting here tonight as
[1:17:34] a jean seed of almighty God is because
[1:17:36] God breathes on you the Holy Ghost
[1:17:41] you see the things that you've received
[1:17:44] they're spiritually discerned
[1:17:49] how in the world could these little
[1:17:51] girls or these the all of you sitting
[1:17:53] here tonight break down the seals unless
[1:17:55] you gather inspiration from somebody
[1:17:57] that was able to tap into that channel
[1:18:01] the rest of the world said we can't
[1:18:03] touch it they they just know it's
[1:18:04] symbols they they look at and they they
[1:18:06] peer into it they presume at it they
[1:18:07] they adventure with that Authority but
[1:18:10] there's a prophet that come here under
[1:18:12] the inspiration of a Ministry of Malachi
[1:18:14] 4 that he's able to go in there and
[1:18:17] release those things to you
[1:18:18] so why is it so powerful that we have a
[1:18:22] ministry under the authority of Malachi
[1:18:24] 4 come and operate it's because the book
[1:18:27] was closed
[1:18:30] foreign
[1:18:31] so you say why are you all constantly
[1:18:33] preaching the message if you want to
[1:18:35] have authority I've got to preach the
[1:18:37] message
[1:18:39] you see the reason why the rest of the
[1:18:41] world can't understand like your
[1:18:43] understanding is because they didn't
[1:18:45] receive it but there is a special glass
[1:18:47] of people
[1:18:49] that understand that the book ain't
[1:18:50] close to them it's not just six seals
[1:18:53] open it's all Seven Seals that third
[1:18:56] part of the seventh seal is your body
[1:18:58] changed and nobody knows that except
[1:19:01] almighty God but Hallelujah the portion
[1:19:05] of the seals that have been released to
[1:19:07] us as the Church of the Living God Only
[1:19:09] You
[1:19:11] as the body of Jesus Christ it's more
[1:19:13] than just history church it's prophecy
[1:19:16] being fulfilled can't you see that the
[1:19:19] same one that the boys on the road to
[1:19:21] amaze was walking with you've been
[1:19:23] walking with
[1:19:25] you swell I don't see him like they saw
[1:19:27] him I see him in you I see the same
[1:19:29] power that was operating in William
[1:19:31] Branham that was operating in our Lord
[1:19:33] Jesus Christ
[1:19:36] how do you see it
[1:19:39] a lot of times it's not like the world
[1:19:41] wants to see it in signs and wonders
[1:19:45] but the love
[1:19:47] of the father
[1:19:50] you know there's really nobody that can
[1:19:52] love like you love
[1:19:58] well don't get too stingy on me here
[1:20:00] tonight you can say Amen
[1:20:05] there's nobody that can show the power
[1:20:07] of the Cross like you can
[1:20:10] there's nobody that can show the world
[1:20:12] what Jesus is like but you
[1:20:17] so where did you get this knowledge from
[1:20:22] you see
[1:20:23] you see it's just like you if you're
[1:20:25] you're asking for healing
[1:20:28] you've got to tap into a Channel of it
[1:20:30] by faith
[1:20:32] and you see it's like job he was needing
[1:20:34] it was lacking
[1:20:35] it was lacking inspiration
[1:20:39] and job didn't really know that he could
[1:20:41] know God until God introduced him to the
[1:20:44] thought that he could be known
[1:20:46] because he begins to talk to him job in
[1:20:49] Job chapter 38 he said where was job
[1:20:51] when I laid out the foundations of the
[1:20:52] world where how do you know and when you
[1:20:55] notice when job goes over in Job chapter
[1:20:57] 42 he said I heard of thee by the
[1:20:59] hearing of thy ears but now I see it you
[1:21:02] see the reason why job was able to know
[1:21:05] God in the power that he knowed him was
[1:21:07] because God introduced him to the
[1:21:09] thought that he could be known
[1:21:12] and the reason why you believe on the
[1:21:14] realm that you believe in is because
[1:21:16] somebody told you
[1:21:18] that you can operate in the realm that
[1:21:21] you're operating in and if you want him
[1:21:23] to appear to you you've got to believe
[1:21:25] on him you've got to keep your mind on
[1:21:27] him you've got to keep your conversation
[1:21:29] about him just like little like the
[1:21:31] little Virgin Mary she had her mind upon
[1:21:34] the scripture that was laying there that
[1:21:36] a virgin shall conceive and all of a
[1:21:38] sudden out of that thought said Gabriel
[1:21:41] if you want angels to appear to you
[1:21:43] you've got to kind of live the life that
[1:21:45] that Zacharias was living he was up
[1:21:48] there serving God and praising God up
[1:21:50] there in the temple offering incense and
[1:21:52] sacrifice a prayer before the Lord and
[1:21:54] then the angel Gabriel appeared to him
[1:21:57] if you want the father to appear to you
[1:21:59] you've got to stay in the word you've
[1:22:02] got to talk about him
[1:22:04] I'll just be real honest with you I
[1:22:06] believe that's a reason why a lot of
[1:22:08] people don't receive their healing and
[1:22:10] they don't receive that they don't
[1:22:11] recognize that the Lord Jesus is right
[1:22:13] there it's because they never talk about
[1:22:15] him
[1:22:17] show me your friends
[1:22:20] and I will tell you who your God is
[1:22:23] show me what you got hanging on your
[1:22:25] walls show me what you listen to show me
[1:22:28] what kind of music you're listening to
[1:22:29] show me how many times you read the
[1:22:31] Bible and I'll tell you how big your God
[1:22:33] is your god is as big as you make him
[1:22:39] your God is as big as you make him and
[1:22:41] it's as little as you're making but if
[1:22:43] you can make him that he's a God that
[1:22:45] does impossibilities he's the god
[1:22:47] that'll carry you through he's a god
[1:22:50] how do you know him like that
[1:22:53] because I know
[1:22:55] I'm not just talking about you something
[1:22:56] I don't know about tonight because the
[1:22:58] Bible tells us in second Eric Colossians
[1:23:00] 3 and 17 that whatever you do in word
[1:23:03] indeed do it all in the name of the Lord
[1:23:05] Jesus Christ
[1:23:07] so what is that it is a channel that is
[1:23:10] simply opened up to the believer that
[1:23:12] whatever you do do it in the name of the
[1:23:14] Lord if you love love in the name of the
[1:23:17] Lord if you ask ask in the name of the
[1:23:19] Lord if you believe believe in the name
[1:23:21] of the Lord if you pray pray in the name
[1:23:23] of the Lord
[1:23:24] so whatsoever you do in word indeed Do
[1:23:27] It All In The Name Of The Lord
[1:23:31] there's a major difference between
[1:23:33] reading
[1:23:34] between reading Emmanuel and skydiving
[1:23:37] and then actually jumping out the plane
[1:23:43] there's a lot of people that know can
[1:23:45] that know how to read it
[1:23:47] but only a select few and have their
[1:23:49] guts to jump out of the plane
[1:23:51] so whatever you do in word or indeed do
[1:23:54] it all in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:55] Christ
[1:23:56] so there's a major difference there's a
[1:23:59] major difference in guessing that God's
[1:24:01] still a Healer and guessing that God's
[1:24:03] still his Savior and guessing that God
[1:24:05] can still do Miracles and there's a
[1:24:07] major difference in knowing
[1:24:09] because guessing is the act of making a
[1:24:11] prediction but knowing is the act of the
[1:24:14] condition of the progress of knowledge
[1:24:18] and the reason why you know that he's a
[1:24:20] savior the reason why you know that he
[1:24:22] saves is because you experienced him as
[1:24:24] a savior the reason why you know that
[1:24:27] he's a God that heals you experience him
[1:24:29] as a God that heals the reason why you
[1:24:31] know he's a deliverer it's because you
[1:24:33] ain't got change on you no more
[1:24:35] [Music]
[1:24:37] laughs
[1:24:38] it's because somebody broke into a
[1:24:41] channel that was blocked up
[1:24:44] [Applause]
[1:24:46] foreign
[1:24:49] in the book of Kings I believe in second
[1:24:52] Kings chapter 3 that you go reading over
[1:24:55] there that there was three kings that
[1:24:57] had went out to battle they went out to
[1:24:59] battle and they had went the Bible said
[1:25:01] they went seven days they went over a
[1:25:03] hundred miles and didn't have no water
[1:25:07] they went up there they had Jerome
[1:25:08] Jehoshaphat and the king of Ammon and
[1:25:11] they were up there and they were needing
[1:25:13] water but there was one that was still
[1:25:15] sober the Lord by the name of that that
[1:25:17] still believed in God and he still
[1:25:19] believed that God did Miracles he said
[1:25:21] is there not a prophet in the land is
[1:25:23] there some Authority that we can go to
[1:25:24] and ask for this water that we've died
[1:25:26] that all of this enemy that has gathered
[1:25:28] around us but we ain't got strength to
[1:25:30] go into the battle so he takes they go
[1:25:32] up there to Elijah and Elijah sits there
[1:25:35] and they don't even come out to them Old
[1:25:37] Kings
[1:25:38] but notice what happens he said bring me
[1:25:41] a menstrual what did it do
[1:25:44] the man said that the prophet was stood
[1:25:46] up he was mad
[1:25:50] you ever get Miffy like that
[1:25:54] here get yourself in a bad mood somebody
[1:25:57] just say something off a cuff at you man
[1:25:58] you spend the rest of the day milking
[1:26:01] what somebody said to you
[1:26:03] boy
[1:26:05] I can't believe she said that to me
[1:26:08] and instead of letting it roll off your
[1:26:10] life you milk it all day long so you
[1:26:11] ain't gonna believe how it messed up my
[1:26:13] day man get Miffy like that
[1:26:16] get right there I know I'm the only one
[1:26:17] that bothers like that
[1:26:22] was Miffy
[1:26:23] all stood up
[1:26:27] he said bring me a menstrual you see he
[1:26:30] knew how to break the atmosphere of a
[1:26:33] bad mood
[1:26:34] it was by pure music and brother random
[1:26:38] said you know what he said I believe
[1:26:39] they got the playing one of them old
[1:26:41] Snappy songs ours gonna be a meeting in
[1:26:44] the air
[1:26:45] he said when the spirit broke the
[1:26:48] prophet was able to see a vision again
[1:26:50] you see what music is it is a channel
[1:26:57] it's well I don't really believe in all
[1:26:59] this music that you guys are having up
[1:27:01] there and I don't really understand why
[1:27:03] you're doing it I don't I don't
[1:27:05] understand why you sing so many songs
[1:27:07] brother Andrew it's because you don't
[1:27:09] understand the power of music
[1:27:14] David knew the power of music
[1:27:18] he said why do you get why do you get so
[1:27:21] under the inspiration to sing certain
[1:27:22] songs and it seems like it ain't going
[1:27:24] good and you can't get the key right now
[1:27:26] music's off but you keep pressing the
[1:27:28] battle it's because I know there's
[1:27:30] something laying there
[1:27:31] and if I could just break into that
[1:27:33] channel it seems like sometimes you get
[1:27:35] to sing in that song way maker and it
[1:27:37] seemed like it ain't going nowhere
[1:27:39] nobody's breaking into the atmosphere
[1:27:41] and then all of a sudden the atmosphere
[1:27:43] changes and somebody breaks into an
[1:27:46] atmosphere and all of a sudden the Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost comes down and blesses this
[1:27:50] brother and blesses his sister it's
[1:27:52] because there's power
[1:27:54] of getting in the channel
[1:28:00] you see mother Brown said if we can get
[1:28:03] them old cold formal shaky ideas off of
[1:28:06] us he said the prophet can see the
[1:28:08] vision again
[1:28:10] if we can shake them formal things off
[1:28:12] of us and those shackles that are upon
[1:28:13] us we can shake them things off of us
[1:28:15] then a vision will break forth
[1:28:20] the prophet knew the power of music
[1:28:23] music has the ability to drive Spirits
[1:28:26] away
[1:28:27] that's why it's important to put the
[1:28:29] right kind of music
[1:28:31] not just any music but the right kind of
[1:28:34] music on
[1:28:35] music that scares the devil right out of
[1:28:38] his bed in the mornings I'm talking
[1:28:40] about music that shakes all of hell and
[1:28:42] runs depression back into its corner
[1:28:44] where it came from
[1:28:48] it's a channel that you can operate in
[1:28:51] his brothers had been without water for
[1:28:53] seven days but the prophet said just go
[1:28:56] out there and start digging some ditches
[1:28:59] just start digging some ditches and the
[1:29:01] water will come you see what did the
[1:29:04] prophet know he knew that the same
[1:29:06] channels was laying there that Moses
[1:29:09] tapped into in Numbers Chapter 20 when
[1:29:12] he smote The Rock he knew that that same
[1:29:15] water was laying right there in the dirt
[1:29:18] but all you got to do is just start
[1:29:20] doing a little bit of digging I know
[1:29:22] there's still power in this message I
[1:29:24] know there's still miracles in this
[1:29:26] message I know they're still holy ghosts
[1:29:28] in this message I know this through
[1:29:29] inspiration in this message but if you
[1:29:32] can get to dig in a little bit
[1:29:34] he said if you get to a spot and they
[1:29:37] say oh brother the days of Miracles has
[1:29:39] passed he said you hit a log just keep
[1:29:41] digging and get that thing out of the
[1:29:43] way if you think that God's done past
[1:29:45] you dig that thing and get it out of the
[1:29:47] way he said if you can dig the ditches
[1:29:49] the water will come
[1:29:53] don't you recognize tonight that the
[1:29:56] same Authority that Moses was under of
[1:29:58] his prophetic Ministry was sitting there
[1:30:01] and preaching the water right out of
[1:30:03] that rock
[1:30:04] and that same inspiration was laying
[1:30:07] there when those kings were looking for
[1:30:09] that water
[1:30:12] I'm preaching you the message I'm
[1:30:14] preaching you the message but if you can
[1:30:16] get them old things out and start
[1:30:17] digging some ditches clean out unbelief
[1:30:20] clean out your closet clean out your
[1:30:22] fear clean out your complexes and just
[1:30:25] get into the channel of it
[1:30:31] and all of a sudden
[1:30:33] the same channels of the Holy Ghost can
[1:30:35] be in operation
[1:30:38] brother Brandon said but what's the
[1:30:40] problem is he said we he said Jesus
[1:30:42] cleaned out all
[1:30:43] of the ditches at Calvary he said but
[1:30:46] these denominations came and filled up
[1:30:47] the ditches again
[1:30:51] it's like a pastor gets to preaching
[1:30:53] man he's preaching he's preaching he's
[1:30:55] preaching man the word's doing his job
[1:30:58] and then all of a sudden somebody brings
[1:30:59] in an idea of denominationalism and it
[1:31:01] starts putting on the world again
[1:31:03] what is it the channels get clogged up
[1:31:07] all you got to do you got a clock you
[1:31:09] got to unclog
[1:31:11] the channels and we all remember what
[1:31:13] brother brother Donnie Reagan preached
[1:31:14] here last Labor Day
[1:31:17] he said we got too many Beaver Dam
[1:31:19] preachers damning up the whales again
[1:31:23] well this is one guy that ain't gonna
[1:31:24] Dam up the water
[1:31:26] that I believe that if you want the Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost there's a channel here for it I
[1:31:31] believe that if you want healing there's
[1:31:33] a channel here for it
[1:31:35] but you've got to have the ability to
[1:31:37] dig some ditches
[1:31:41] I'm closing but you know why God bless
[1:31:44] my papa Charlie
[1:31:47] y'all know it's about to get real when
[1:31:49] you say God bless him
[1:31:51] Martini said you could say anything you
[1:31:53] want to about somebody as long as you
[1:31:54] said bless their heart
[1:32:00] so here's somebody say bless her heart
[1:32:01] down here in the south
[1:32:03] it ain't a blessing
[1:32:09] but God God bless my Papa Charlie's
[1:32:11] heart
[1:32:16] you know he had we had this whole
[1:32:18] four-wheeler one time
[1:32:21] foreign
[1:32:22] had a system
[1:32:24] he had a system on how how he knew what
[1:32:27] gasoline was and how he knew what diesel
[1:32:29] was
[1:32:30] had same cans looked the same
[1:32:33] everything about him was the same except
[1:32:35] for they were some fodder twine
[1:32:36] that was wrapped around one of them and
[1:32:38] only he knew the key of it
[1:32:42] well one day his old four-wheeler that
[1:32:44] he had
[1:32:45] wouldn't work one day and he blamed
[1:32:48] every single one of us
[1:32:50] it was Andrew it was Matthew it was
[1:32:52] Gabriel it was Malachi it was Michael it
[1:32:54] was this way it was Mark
[1:32:55] well come to find out it was old Charlie
[1:33:00] he didn't even knew that he did it but
[1:33:02] what did he do he put diesel in there
[1:33:04] when he should have put gasoline in
[1:33:06] there and what did he do he clogged up
[1:33:08] the carburetor and he clogged up all
[1:33:10] things well brother Mark he just kept on
[1:33:12] fighting with that thing he got it
[1:33:14] running one day and it took him a good
[1:33:16] 30 minutes to blow out all the smoke out
[1:33:18] of the carburetor he like all the hills
[1:33:20] a pilate was on fire
[1:33:23] what did he do he clogged up the Channel
[1:33:26] with the wrong type of source
[1:33:30] but if you can get the right kind of
[1:33:32] power back in what's supposed to operate
[1:33:34] in there you'll see Miracles come to
[1:33:36] pass you'll see Dynamics come to pass if
[1:33:39] you can operate
[1:33:41] now if you can put the message on the
[1:33:44] inside of these temples you'll watch all
[1:33:47] the hell get burned up here tonight
[1:33:48] because somebody started putting the
[1:33:51] right kind of thing in the right kind of
[1:33:53] vessel
[1:33:55] it's because you're built for a certain
[1:33:57] type of message
[1:33:59] come on somebody you ain't a buzzard you
[1:34:02] ain't a chicken you're an eagle you're
[1:34:04] bound to go you're built to go higher
[1:34:06] you're built to fly higher nobody can
[1:34:09] operate in the channel that you're
[1:34:11] operating in it's because it's pure
[1:34:13] message for you it's a hundred octane
[1:34:16] message
[1:34:18] come on come on musicians
[1:34:22] you're built for another class
[1:34:25] you're built for another speed
[1:34:29] we say well I just get a little bit
[1:34:31] bogged down every once in a while what
[1:34:32] are you putting in there
[1:34:34] come on Charlie
[1:34:37] come on Charlie start pushing that that
[1:34:39] diesel down in there when it's supposed
[1:34:41] to be gasoline
[1:34:44] I love you Papa I love you a lot
[1:34:48] thank you for the example though I
[1:34:50] really appreciate it it worked good for
[1:34:51] me tonight
[1:34:53] foreign
[1:34:54] ain't that the way you do with your life
[1:34:56] it seems like man
[1:35:04] things are messed up
[1:35:07] because you put the wrong thing in there
[1:35:09] and you're trying to live a real holy
[1:35:10] life and you've been stuffing that old
[1:35:12] worldliness down in there
[1:35:21] you'd start wiping off all that stuff
[1:35:23] the world's got it
[1:35:26] start putting the dress on you can
[1:35:30] I'll tell you something else when you
[1:35:32] had the right kind of operating power on
[1:35:34] the inside of that four-wheeler you
[1:35:35] could do all kinds of things let me tell
[1:35:37] you something them boys them boys on
[1:35:40] that show Dukes of Hazzard didn't have
[1:35:41] nothing on us pilot boys
[1:35:43] we jump hay fields we jumped hay wagons
[1:35:46] we jumped anything and everything
[1:35:47] because we had the right kind of power
[1:35:50] in the operation that it was built for
[1:35:53] I'd beat my children if they did that
[1:35:55] today
[1:35:57] thank God there was no cell phones and
[1:35:59] no cameras around when I was growing up
[1:36:03] but there is cameras
[1:36:05] and there is cell phones
[1:36:09] but if you can put the right con a
[1:36:11] message
[1:36:12] on the right kind of heart
[1:36:14] you'll move at a speed that's so dynamic
[1:36:17] the devil can't keep up with you
[1:36:20] how many would say Lord keep me
[1:36:22] sanctified
[1:36:25] amen amen do you love the Lord tonight
[1:36:28] well I appreciate
[1:36:30] praise you praise the Lord
