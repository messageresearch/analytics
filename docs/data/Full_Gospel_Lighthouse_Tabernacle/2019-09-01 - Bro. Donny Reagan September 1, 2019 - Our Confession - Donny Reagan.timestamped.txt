[21:27] I
[21:29] [Music]
[21:32] praise the Lord what a wonderful thing
[21:34] it is to be free
[21:36] today God bless you let's turn if you
[21:39] would in the
[21:40] scripture to the little book of fiman
[21:43] chapter just one chapter there verse
[21:48] five what a privilege it's been to be
[21:52] together in these days and these
[21:54] Services I guess the sad part about it
[21:57] is always when we have to say goodbye we
[22:00] have to go our separate ways and things
[22:03] that'll we be facing after these
[22:05] wonderful meetings U it's h want to be
[22:08] with brother Wayne brother Tim my friend
[22:10] brother Ron different ministers and
[22:13] Saints different church that are
[22:15] represented trust the Lord Jesus will
[22:18] help us today and I know that you've
[22:20] been here for a long time this morning
[22:22] so I'll try not to be too
[22:25] long um this is quite a quite a book
[22:30] it's a little book only one
[22:32] chapter um unlike many of the other New
[22:36] Testament books that were named of
[22:38] course Matthew Martin Luke and John book
[22:41] of Acts Corinthians
[22:44] Philippians U named after different
[22:46] cities named after
[22:48] Apostles but this book Bears the name of
[22:52] just a lay
[22:54] member right and this man is not a
[22:57] preacher
[22:58] uh as far as historically no record that
[23:00] he ever became a preacher but he was a a
[23:05] Christian a man filled with the Holy
[23:07] Ghost a good brother that loved God and
[23:10] really had some outstanding things about
[23:13] his character so let us read if you
[23:16] would U begin reading in verse five
[23:19] hearing of thy love and faith which thou
[23:23] H has toward the lord
[23:25] Jesus and toward All
[23:29] Saints that the
[23:31] communication of thy faith may become
[23:36] effectual now this word effectual means
[23:40] powerful active
[23:43] energetic and perfected in full
[23:47] knowledge that the communication of thy
[23:50] faith the word communication is coia
[23:53] which means the sharing of your faith so
[23:56] this this brother God had done done
[23:58] something for him he's a real real
[24:01] example of Christianity and he was
[24:02] sharing what God had done for him but
[24:05] Paul wanted something else to happen in
[24:08] this brother's life that the
[24:10] communication of thy faith may become
[24:15] now he's growing so he wants him to
[24:18] become
[24:20] effectual so faith can actually become
[24:23] more effectual more energized we don't
[24:27] want
[24:28] intellectual Faith certainly not notice
[24:31] he says that it may become effectual so
[24:34] how does faith become
[24:37] effectual by the
[24:39] acknowledging of every good
[24:42] thing which is in
[24:45] you in Christ
[24:47] Jesus so it's not just having it it's
[24:51] not just believing it but it's actually
[24:54] acknowledging it now listen this brother
[24:58] in verse 7 for we have great joy and
[25:01] consolation in thy love because the
[25:04] bowels of the Saints now you may know
[25:07] this read in the New Testament that in
[25:09] the this first century time that they
[25:11] viewed the bowels as being the emotion
[25:13] the very heart you know the way you felt
[25:16] things your spirit what we would say
[25:17] today in our spirit the bows of the
[25:20] Saints are
[25:23] refreshed by thee
[25:26] brother so this indicates to us that
[25:29] fimon was the type of a Christian that
[25:33] was a refreshing sort of a Christian now
[25:37] we've all been around Christians like
[25:38] that haven't we that were refreshing to
[25:40] be around and they were enjoyable and
[25:43] we've been around others that were the
[25:45] other
[25:46] way they're not near as much fun and
[25:49] they're not near as exciting and you
[25:51] know you just feel all washed out when
[25:53] you leave them right oh wouldn't it be
[25:56] wonderful if every one of us us to leave
[25:58] this meeting being this type of a person
[26:00] right
[26:01] here the bowels of the Saints are
[26:04] refreshed by the brother now the church
[26:07] at colassi actually most of you know
[26:09] that there was no church buildings in
[26:11] the 1 and 2 Century even up to about 300
[26:15] years before the Catholic Church would
[26:18] actually started building temples and
[26:19] Tabernacles and so on but the churches
[26:22] many of them were in buildings public
[26:24] houses and they were also in people's
[26:26] homes now there very little we know
[26:28] about this guy except that he was a a
[26:30] businessman sort of a wealthy type of a
[26:32] man but the church at coloss so actually
[26:35] to there and this church was actually in
[26:38] this man's house him and his wife and
[26:41] their son which Paul mentioned now
[26:44] notice whenever something about this
[26:46] brother is so outstanding that the word
[26:49] the word of that day was living out of
[26:52] his life but Paul wanted it to be
[26:55] greater an achievement by him being able
[26:58] to recognize all that God had done in
[27:00] him let's read also in Philippians
[27:02] chapter
[27:05] 4:8 finally Brethren whatsoever things
[27:08] are true whatsoever things are
[27:12] honest whatsoever things are just
[27:16] whatsoever things are pure which
[27:19] eliminates most of the apps that we have
[27:21] on our
[27:26] phones
[27:28] basically all your news things are all
[27:30] fake news it ain't just see an end or
[27:33] all right our our minds are filled with
[27:36] so much nonsense and so much negativity
[27:40] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[27:42] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[27:45] of good report if there be any virtue if
[27:49] there be any
[27:54] praise think on the these things let's
[28:00] bow our heads
[28:02] together Heavenly Father we have had a
[28:04] wonderful time in your
[28:06] presence it's been so
[28:08] good to be able to set under the
[28:11] atmosphere that we've had here Lord from
[28:13] the very first service it was so charged
[28:17] with
[28:18] expectation Lord I just walking in the
[28:20] building the first night and it just
[28:22] felt like there was such a pressure but
[28:24] it wasn't a bad pressure it was just a
[28:27] charge of an atmosphere of the saints of
[28:30] God thank you Lord in this last day in
[28:33] this time of evil and darkness there are
[28:36] children that still love to come to the
[28:39] house of God and they don't come with a
[28:42] dread they do not come with drudgery but
[28:44] they come with such Heavenly
[28:47] anticipation Lord we thank you for that
[28:50] last night so powerful thank you Lord
[28:53] Jesus once again here we come father to
[28:55] the final service of these meetings and
[28:58] with sadness we come to the last service
[29:01] but yet also with anticipation knowing
[29:04] that one day we will say our last a amen
[29:07] we will say our last goodbyes and we'll
[29:09] never have to separate again so we
[29:12] desire today father that while we are
[29:14] gathered here I understand that they've
[29:15] been here for quite some time so I pray
[29:18] that you'd make me mindful of that but
[29:20] Lord while we're here we know the value
[29:23] of going to be placed on the word of God
[29:25] I want to bring something to them today
[29:27] that they can take wiom Lord when they
[29:30] Journey down the road today tomorrow
[29:32] whenever they head home something that
[29:34] will be a benefit to them Lord Jesus we
[29:37] pray that the word of God will speak
[29:39] today help me to be an oracle help me to
[29:40] get out of the way shut my mouth to
[29:43] anything that would be displeasing to
[29:45] you I Surrender myself Lord Jesus and I
[29:47] pray that you'd anoint me but anoint
[29:49] them as well that we can receive from
[29:52] you today in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:55] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[29:58] you may be
[30:03] seated I'd like to speak to you today
[30:05] for just a bit on uh our
[30:09] confession now we know we're living in
[30:11] an age when uh so many preachers and Leo

[30:17] it plan and uh you know you want a BMW
[30:20] just claim it you want to Cadillac just
[30:22] claim it and that's that's not at all of
[30:24] course what we believe that God has
[30:26] instituted for his children but I do
[30:29] believe that they have broken into a
[30:30] principle of God's truth that is
[30:33] absolutely right but yet we know Satan
[30:37] always uses scarecrows and they should
[30:40] scare crows and not scare us so the
[30:43] truth of God's word is that we want to
[30:45] be able to take every aspect I thought
[30:47] brother Tim brought it out so
[30:48] beautifully last night of every part of
[30:50] the Lamb the head the legs the
[30:52] pertinence thereof so there's parts
[30:54] that's more tasty than others and if
[30:56] ever true preacher would be honest he
[30:58] would let you know today there's certain
[31:00] things he'd rather preach than other
[31:02] things a that right brother so that's
[31:04] just the way that the word of God comes
[31:06] but we know that there is a truth in the
[31:09] words that we speak our words have great
[31:11] power not only our words but the words
[31:14] of politicians the words of people no
[31:16] doubt we are sitting here today being
[31:18] influenced by the atmosphere that we
[31:20] were in our home if you were raised with
[31:23] a lot of negativity and you were raised
[31:25] being told that you would never amount
[31:26] to any say and you'd never be anything
[31:29] and all of that no doubt a lot of that
[31:31] has impacted you to this very day and as
[31:34] brother Tim again brought it out last
[31:35] night that God wants to change our
[31:37] spirit from our spirit imagination
[31:39] conscience memory reason and affection
[31:41] it was the second realm of us that God
[31:43] gave us in a substitute for the
[31:45] theophany one day the spirit will break
[31:47] up when we die and we get the word form
[31:49] bed the theophany that we should have
[31:51] had in the first place but until that
[31:53] time we're stuck with this human Spirit
[31:55] like it or not so so God helps us to be
[31:58] able to um become Born Again In the soul
[32:01] but the spirit's not born again the
[32:03] flesh is not born again but God wants it
[32:05] to be subject to the nature that's
[32:07] living inside of us and we're living in
[32:09] a very negative world are we not every
[32:12] day you know all your news all your apps
[32:15] all we've got all these things years and
[32:17] years ago if an earthquake would have
[32:19] happened somewhere around the world and
[32:20] 5,000 people would have died 150 years
[32:23] ago people living in the United States
[32:25] if it happened in Afghanistan they might
[32:27] have heard it 50 years after it happened
[32:29] they might have heard it if they ever
[32:30] did hear it and that's that's not just
[32:32] so many years ago as it would have been
[32:34] also on the days of our parents but in
[32:36] the days now that we have television
[32:38] radio then we move up where we have apps
[32:40] and news notifications and all this and
[32:42] our minds our Spirits our constant
[32:45] Humanity all the time is being flooded
[32:48] over with so many negative things so
[32:51] much sickness politics politics saying
[32:54] this and that and the other negativity
[32:56] and you you know what we're living in
[32:58] such a great age with so many positive
[33:01] things to look at in the word of
[33:03] God I believe we ought to feed more on
[33:06] those things than we shut on all those
[33:09] negative things we'll never change all
[33:12] of that but what we can do is change our
[33:14] diet and change the things that we think
[33:17] about now I'm going to I'm going to read
[33:19] a few scriptures with you write them
[33:20] down if you like Psalms 19:14 let the
[33:23] words of my mouth and the meditation of
[33:26] my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh
[33:29] Lord my strength and my redeemer Psalms
[33:33] 1413 set a watch oh Lord before my mouth
[33:38] and keep the door of my lips now I
[33:42] wonder why we would need a watch over
[33:46] our mouths and something to prohibit an
[33:49] outgo or an income of the door of our
[33:53] lips unless there is power in our words
[33:56] Proverbs 6:2 thou art snared with the
[34:00] words of thy mouth Thou Art taken and
[34:03] that word is a similar word that they
[34:04] would use to catch foul and you Thou Art
[34:07] taken with the words of thy mouth
[34:11] Proverbs 13:3 he that keepeth his mouth
[34:15] keepeth his
[34:19] life well praise the Lord he that now
[34:23] let me just tell you up front this is
[34:24] not going to be deep don't worry I'm not
[34:26] going to just you know you going to
[34:28] really have to concentrate and really no
[34:30] it's going to be right down where we all
[34:32] live where we all walk all that sort of
[34:35] things so you don't have to worry about
[34:36] no deep things I'm not that type
[34:38] preacher no way he that keepeth his
[34:41] mouth keepeth his life but he that
[34:44] openest wide his lips shall have
[34:49] destruction you mean simply just from
[34:52] talking and simply from saying certain
[34:55] things that we will open open our mouth
[34:58] I'm not a very good Christian God don't
[35:00] love me I'm I'm no count I'm rotten
[35:03] you're talking the devil's language when
[35:05] you're saying
[35:06] that people think you got to be cussing
[35:09] and got to saying all kinds of things
[35:11] like that to talk the devil's language
[35:13] oh no the devil has a Sanctified
[35:15] language for church folks and they don't
[35:18] use curse words that don't use in things
[35:20] come on now but he uses scriptures he
[35:23] uses message quotes that's right notice
[35:26] and Proverbs 15:4 a wholesome tongue is
[35:31] a tree of life a wholesome tongue is a
[35:36] tree of life and the word wholesome
[35:38] there means health and healing so a
[35:42] healthy tongue wow a healthy tongue is a
[35:48] tree of life but perverseness therein is
[35:53] a breach in the spirit Proverbs 18:21
[35:58] death and life are in the
[36:04] power not of the Soul not of the spirit
[36:07] but in the power of the
[36:12] tongue death and life are in the power
[36:16] of the tongue and they that love it
[36:18] shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew
[36:22] 12:37 for by thy words Thou shalt be
[36:26] justified ified and by thy words Thou
[36:29] shalt be
[36:31] condemned and the Saints said now watch
[36:35] brother brandham now pick up the exact
[36:37] same thought and that Thy word he said
[36:39] talking about people being called in the
[36:41] prayer line now if your numberers called
[36:42] tonight in the prayer line if God
[36:44] reveals your heart and speaks to you and
[36:46] gives you Deliverance here don't you
[36:49] never have no kind of a testimony only
[36:53] that he healed you because if you do if
[36:58] you one time testify to the other side
[37:02] the negative side it will come back on
[37:06] you worse than it was
[37:10] before now we know how it is in special
[37:13] meetings when anointed Servants of God
[37:15] pray for us and they they're able to
[37:17] unite their faith with our faith and
[37:19] bring you know something Supernatural
[37:22] and special I appreciate that myself
[37:24] don't you but yet we know that that us
[37:27] keeping that Deliverance will not be
[37:29] based upon constant contact with that
[37:31] servant of God and calling him and
[37:34] texting him and emailing him but it will
[37:37] be our constant faith in what God said
[37:40] that the God who delivered me will keep
[37:43] me delivered and The God Who healed me
[37:46] will keep me healed and the God who
[37:48] saved me will keep me saved but a lot of
[37:52] it has to do with the way that we look
[37:54] at it can you imagine brother bam
[37:56] telling the people that the very God who
[37:58] heals them would be able to keep it away
[38:01] as long as their testimony was positive
[38:04] that I am
[38:06] healed well praise the Lord notice again
[38:09] he says let him that's weak say I am
[38:12] strong just say in your heart that I am
[38:16] now strong I have now accepted Jesus as
[38:20] my healer never have a negative
[38:23] testimony anymore but I'm going to tell
[38:27] that was hard in 1953 when he said that
[38:30] but it's a lot harder now than it was
[38:32] then there's Pro there's probably not a
[38:35] family here in this place today that
[38:37] have all kinds of trauma we have all
[38:40] kinds of family issues we have church
[38:42] issues we have job issues we've got
[38:45] mental issues psychological issues money
[38:48] issues car issues truck issues kid
[38:51] issues dog issues cat issues house
[38:54] issues rent issues ownership ship issues
[38:57] we've got issues and if we're not
[39:00] careful all of those things will occupy
[39:03] our mind and we're so defeated and we go
[39:06] to the house of God and the preacher has
[39:09] to spend the first half of his sermon
[39:11] and raising us up high enough to even be
[39:14] able to receive something from
[39:22] God oh my notice this now you imagine
[39:25] this is 1951 when he said this never
[39:27] have a negative testimony anymore just
[39:30] believe it God is under obligation Jesus
[39:33] Christ setting on the right hand of the
[39:35] Throne of God he said to accept you he's
[39:38] sitting there is the high priest of your
[39:41] confession to make good before the
[39:43] father anything that he died for that
[39:46] you're confessing that he's done now
[39:50] notice the link the Lord Jesus is there
[39:52] as our high priest to be able to make
[39:55] good everything that his word says but
[39:58] it must line with your confession so if
[40:01] you say well I I'll never have Victory
[40:04] he cannot confess that before the father
[40:07] because that's not what he
[40:09] says so you say well I I'm not healed I
[40:12] guess I'll just be sick all of my entire
[40:14] life so where does the bible say that
[40:16] where does the bible say you can't have
[40:18] peace and joy and power and a life
[40:21] filled with oh my with the glory of God
[40:24] where does the bible say we can't have
[40:26] it so we do all of this talking and all
[40:28] this confessing when the Lord Jesus
[40:31] desires for us and him to say the same
[40:34] thing can you imagine when you say the
[40:38] same thing his word says about you he
[40:41] confesses your confession before the E
[40:45] Hallelujah before the Eternal God and
[40:48] then you and him are lined up and it
[40:51] will come to
[40:55] pass
[40:57] oh my you know brother Ram tells us that
[41:00] Abraham received a promise from God and
[41:03] he watered that promise every day with
[41:07] praises Praise Is water on the seed of
[41:12] God's
[41:15] word notice this again and accept God's
[41:18] gift I love this one to me it is just
[41:20] absolutely tremendous healing is not
[41:22] something that you just say well I
[41:24] believe it I believe it and I said
[41:26] that's all right if that's the best you
[41:28] can do just mentally or just say well I
[41:30] see it I believe it I accept it then if
[41:33] you accept it on that basis keep saying
[41:37] it over and over and say it out
[41:44] loud now why because in your
[41:46] subconscious remember the prophet tells
[41:48] us there's a man down in the engine room
[41:50] and then there's a man in the ship and
[41:52] he's the one up on the deck he's the
[41:54] captain he's the one who makes the calls
[41:55] down to the guy in the engine room and
[41:57] the guy in the engine room is the one
[41:59] who actually directs the ship now he
[42:01] said you will say you believe your word
[42:03] that believe God's word that's the
[42:04] captain that's the senses up here but
[42:07] the man down inside of you in the
[42:09] subconscious he'll say well God Did It
[42:11] for so and so but he won't do it for you
[42:14] and you you've asked God about this now
[42:15] how many times and God still ain't done
[42:17] it this is the guy that runs the ship
[42:20] himself and then whenever you go to
[42:22] saying God's word by his stripes I am
[42:25] healed well I'm just keeping it to
[42:27] myself that's exactly what the devil
[42:29] wants you to do the devil knows there is
[42:32] power in you hearing yourself say God's
[42:38] word oh
[42:40] Hallelujah it ain't enough just to say
[42:43] it on the inside but say it amen I am
[42:47] healed I am delivered I am a child of
[42:51] God I have
[42:54] Victory amen
[42:57] [Applause]
[43:02] keep saying it over and over say it out
[43:05] loud say it over and over just keep
[43:09] saying it I'm Healed I'm
[43:13] heal now listen to these words and then
[43:16] he says say it until you actually
[43:20] believe
[43:23] it so you mean you can start saying it
[43:27] and don't believe it
[43:30] exactly amen don't never have a a
[43:33] negative testimony every time you
[43:35] confess it well I still feel bad today
[43:38] you'll go right back to the same rut you
[43:41] was in the beginning there's not a man
[43:43] or woman here baptized with the Holy
[43:45] Spirit if you would start your
[43:47] confession I believe I've lost the Holy
[43:50] Spirit I believe it's gone from me
[43:53] you'll go right down from right there
[43:57] why because God made us a Creator we are
[44:01] creators of both positive and negative
[44:05] and we're able to create an atmosphere
[44:07] every one of us here today create the
[44:09] atmosphere we live in remember we are
[44:13] astronauts amen we are astronauts if
[44:17] astronauts go to the Moon they don't let
[44:19] the atmosphere of the moon affect them
[44:21] why they take their own atmosphere with
[44:24] them they have a space suit they have a
[44:27] space suit they walk on the moon with
[44:30] their own atmosphere so are we living in
[44:34] the middle of Le DEA and darkness and
[44:37] chaos but I am an astronaut amen I
[44:42] refuse to live in the atmosphere of Le
[44:45] to se of
[44:52] [Applause]
[44:54] Sinise
[44:57] again he says don't have no negative
[44:59] testimony testify positive Jesus says
[45:03] heal me and I'm
[45:06] well no matter how you're feeling oh
[45:09] that's what gets us though well how do
[45:11] you feel you'd have to be pretty well
[45:13] dumb not to feel something here the way
[45:15] these meetings have been numb and
[45:17] couldn't oh but Dy when the devil is
[45:20] going to bother you it's when you leave
[45:22] this
[45:23] atmosphere then you head down the road
[45:26] and you get home and all kinds of
[45:27] problems away but you can stand when you
[45:29] get home with the same Victory you feel
[45:31] right here today because you believe God
[45:35] loves you he cares for
[45:39] you notice the prophet said if you get
[45:42] back to that every time you have a
[45:43] negative testimony and you look at your
[45:46] symptoms you're falling right then
[45:49] there's not a Christian in you no matter
[45:51] how solid you are in the faith if right
[45:53] now something happened to get a hold to
[45:55] you you and tell you you're not a
[45:57] Christian and you start testifying well
[46:01] I'm not a Christian no more you've
[46:03] dropped right then you're not a
[46:05] Christian from that point
[46:08] on as soon as you testify you're not a
[46:11] Christian you Dro From
[46:14] Grace you're Fallen because your own
[46:17] speech tells what you are it's oh my
[46:20] it's faith that acts every
[46:23] time so what is your
[46:31] confession I talk about in church I a't
[46:33] talk about in front of everybody I'm
[46:35] talking about you when you and you and
[46:39] you are alone your soul your spirit your
[46:43] body what talking what selft talk do you
[46:48] do to
[46:52] yourself well yall quiet this morning
[46:57] I noticed brother man said it's a
[46:59] strange thing so much people thought of
[47:01] in this day and they say well I'm weak
[47:03] in faith my faith is not very much I'm
[47:06] not a very good Christian that's just
[47:08] what the devil wants you to say you're
[47:11] talking his
[47:14] language now you imagine no curse words
[47:17] or nothing like that which would not
[47:19] come out of our mouths at all and we say
[47:21] oh well I'm just not a very good
[47:23] Christian I don't have much faith I'm
[47:24] not this I'm not the other that's
[47:26] exactly what Satan wants you to say
[47:30] don't never let your T testimony be
[47:32] negative let it be positive all the time
[47:35] I am saved I have God in my heart I
[47:40] believe him with all my heart do you
[47:42] believe in Divine Healing with all my
[47:45] heart let your testimony and your
[47:48] thoughts never let a negative thought
[47:51] come in your mind if you can help it and
[47:54] when it starts don't entertain
[47:57] it you say well I can't keep the
[48:00] thoughts from coming well be like the
[48:02] farmer that said he couldn't stop the
[48:04] birds from flying over his place but he
[48:06] could sure stop them from
[48:11] rooting you can't help thoughts when
[48:14] they
[48:15] come but don't entertain
[48:23] them so are you getting in your
[48:25] automobile you're going to work it's
[48:26] Monday
[48:28] morning somebody gets in the car with
[48:31] you his name is
[48:37] Lucifer you say fuckle up devil it's a
[48:39] law here in
[48:42] Virginia it's amazing to me how much
[48:45] people can tell you and quote you things
[48:46] the devil told them 40 years ago and
[48:49] they can't hardly quote one quote to
[48:51] save their life well the devil told me
[48:53] this and the devil told me that and the
[48:55] devil told me this and the devil what
[48:56] are you doing memorizing his words
[48:59] you're you're talking about if preachers
[49:01] lied to you the way the devil did You'
[49:03] star and feather him why do we even
[49:07] listen to that liar why do we believe
[49:10] one word he
[49:14] [Applause]
[49:16] says oh
[49:18] my my my notice this brother R said God
[49:21] can only bless you as you confess he has
[49:25] done it for you he is the high priest of
[49:29] our confession is that right Hebrews
[49:31] three he can only do for us you're
[49:34] talking about three powerful aspects in
[49:36] this principle of God he can only do for
[49:38] us as we accept it and believe it and
[49:44] confess
[49:46] it what is that a b
[49:51] c accept believe confess
[49:58] amen a do you believe
[50:01] ABC accept believe and confess oh but
[50:05] what if what if what if I get up I get
[50:07] pray for and something happens and I I
[50:08] go to testifying about and then it don't
[50:10] happen it don't happen then what have I
[50:14] done that's what keeps many of us back
[50:16] our fear of
[50:19] failure we're so afraid the Bible tells
[50:22] me in Revelation those who will be cast
[50:25] into to hell are the fearful you know
[50:28] what that word means those who refuse to
[50:30] go on with God they're not infidels
[50:33] they're not unbelievers but they were so
[50:36] fear afraid of failure that they just
[50:39] stood on the outside of it well you know
[50:41] it's good for everybody else but I don't
[50:43] think I
[50:47] could well praise the
[50:50] Lord why you worry about this service
[50:52] being long
[50:54] willly
[50:57] I want you to notice this again brother
[50:59] B says remember God will make your
[51:05] body come

[51:17] idea that we've all got to die
[51:20] sick where do we get this idea we we

[52:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost we heard that
[52:47] so beautifully last night but we're
[52:49] talking about folks that have an
[52:50] intellectual Faith but all of a sudden
[52:53] their conversation their communic ation
[52:56] changes your testimony will bring you
[52:59] right into it if you believe in healing
[53:01] and believe that God has healed you and
[53:03] confession God will make your body obey
[53:08] your
[53:10] confession well if God can do that with
[53:12] Divine Healing what about an addiction
[53:14] to
[53:15] pornography what about an addiction to
[53:17] something else cannot God make your
[53:20] fingers obey the confession of the word
[53:23] of God
[53:27] I think it's pretty sad when the
[53:29] smartphones are smarter than the
[53:33] owners well that didn't cost you
[53:38] nothing notice he said you go R out of
[53:40] this building tonight testifying that
[53:42] you're saved but what if you go out and
[53:44] say well I don't know I don't know if
[53:46] I'm saved God will make your body obey
[53:49] your confession remember he will make
[53:52] your body obey
[53:55] your confession so what do you talk
[53:58] about so much of your
[54:01] days what do you say about you and God
[54:05] you and your family you and your church
[54:09] you and the Rapture you and the
[54:12] resurrection you and the Millennium what
[54:14] do you say about

[54:28] today by the help of the Lord I'm going
[54:30] to give you some things to talk
[54:39] [Applause]
[54:43] about and this is what as the people of
[54:45] God if you aren't already doing it we
[54:47] need to make some
[54:50] improvements let's start with the simple
[54:52] Basics I'm forgiven
[54:58] this is our confession I'm
[55:02] forgiven I'm saved I wrote a bunch of
[55:05] them down my memory ain't near quite
[55:07] what it used to be so I B wrote a bunch
[55:09] of these
[55:10] down I'm forgiven I'm
[55:14] saved I'm
[55:17] redeemed I'm
[55:20] Justified I'm
[55:22] bought and
[55:24] purchased
[55:26] my body is his
[55:29] Temple Hallelujah when Satan comes
[55:32] against you with some sort of Temptation
[55:34] to get you to do this or that you remind
[55:37] that devil in that Temptation my body is
[55:40] a tabernacle of the Holy Ghost I am
[55:44] tabernacling deity I don't need to look
[55:47] at that I don't need to do this I don't
[55:49] need to say that amen my body is a
[55:53] tabernacle of the Lord
[55:59] Hallelujah I have eternal
[56:03] life I have access to
[56:07] God I am
[56:09] Inseparable from
[56:13] Christ I am more than a
[56:17] conqueror he will renew my strengths I
[56:22] have value in God's eyes eyes as a
[56:26] matter of fact I am the apple of his
[56:33] eyes I am accepted in
[56:37] Christ God will meet my
[56:41] needs I am made the righteousness of
[56:46] God I am loved by God he cares for
[56:52] me I'm me just drop this one in now
[56:55] which ain't on my notes it'll make
[56:56] Psalms 23 a whole lot more personal the
[56:59] Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want
[57:04] he maketh me to lie down in green
[57:07] pasture he leadth me beside the still
[57:10] wat he restores my soul oh Hallelujah to
[57:15] God he anointed my head with oil my C
[57:19] brought us over bless said be the name
[57:22] of the Lord surely goodness and mercy
[57:25] shall follow me all the days of my life
[57:29] and I will dwell in the house of the
[57:33] Lord
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:50] forever I am an
[57:53] overcomer
[57:55] I have self
[58:02] control that's what's wrong the majority
[58:04] of the people of the world they've lost
[58:06] control of theel but as a child of God I
[58:09] have self-
[58:12] control the Lord is my
[58:15] strength he is my
[58:19] deliverer he is my defense he is my
[58:25] Refuge he is my peace he is my mediator
[58:32] he will work all things for my
[58:40] good now if I just stop right here right
[58:43] here and you all would take these things
[58:46] and apply them all of us preachers
[58:47] included to our lives I wonder what kind
[58:49] of folks would'
[58:52] be I wonder if we realize how much
[58:55] negativity that we live in how much
[58:57] Satan is trying his best for many of you
[59:00] I don't know how the devil knows if a
[59:01] person has the holy ghost or not but no
[59:04] doubt there's a sphere there's a way the
[59:06] pulsation of light from your soul
[59:08] there's some way that he can look and
[59:09] see and know that you're different than
[59:11] everybody else and he no longer tries to
[59:14] attack the realm of the soul but he'll
[59:16] attack the spirit and he'll attack the
[59:18] body and he'll try to cause all kinds of
[59:21] situations in your home in your life in
[59:24] your church and our minds are in such
[59:26] turmoil come on Saints and we don't know
[59:29] what to do which way to turn anybody
[59:31] there of course you are and yet what
[59:33] does it do if he cannot stop you from
[59:35] being a child of God he wants to rob you
[59:39] of the full benefit of what Jesus Christ
[59:42] died
[59:44] for so we're sad we're oppressed we're
[59:47] depleted and we're just not sure if we
[59:50] can make it another day or
[59:53] not
[59:58] so we get out of
[1:00:00] bed oh no I didn't die with a heart
[1:00:04] attack during the
[1:00:06] night oh
[1:00:12] God a lot of folks want to go to heaven
[1:00:14] sure we all do that are Christians but
[1:00:16] I'll tell you some folks desire to go to
[1:00:18] heaven is to get out of this world they
[1:00:20] just don't want to deal with difficulty
[1:00:22] they don't want to deal with hardship
[1:00:23] well I'm going to tell you something

[1:00:27] were born to torment
[1:00:35] hell amen as the children of God the
[1:00:38] prophet said that I believe a man or
[1:00:41] woman can live so close to God that the
[1:00:44] devil don't know what to do with you can
[1:00:49] you imagine you getting up every morning

[1:12:55] tea and eat a baloney sandwich and eat a
[1:12:58] little Debbie when it's all done cuz we
[1:13:00] will devastate our own
[1:13:04] selves well the devil done this and the
[1:13:06] devil don't blame the devil for a lot of
[1:13:09] stuff that we've
[1:13:15] done I go to smelling this same feeling
[1:13:18] at the home church and I go to preaching
[1:13:19] on and stuff like
[1:13:21] that smells like hide Ro thing you
[1:13:29] know brother Don surely you don't
[1:13:32] believe we can live a Godly life young
[1:13:33] people yes there will be young people
[1:13:37] come out of this age the most wretched
[1:13:40] dark sinful Wicked age that's ever been
[1:13:43] there will be young men and young women
[1:13:45] that will come out of this age and
[1:13:47] they're not hanging on Mama's coattail
[1:13:49] or Daddy's coattail or the preacher's
[1:13:51] coattail they're going to come out of
[1:13:53] this age a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:13:57] amen they may have had all kinds of
[1:13:59] strains in their family but they took
[1:14:02] the word of God and they accepted and
[1:14:05] believed and
[1:14:18] confessed so can you imagine one of the
[1:14:21] books of the New Testament
[1:14:23] being named after
[1:14:29] you if you read the book of fimon you'll
[1:14:32] notice that Paul leaves out the
[1:14:33] apostolic Authority that he has he
[1:14:35] leaves out all that which he addresses
[1:14:37] in Philippians and all the other books
[1:14:39] because this is actually a personal
[1:14:41] letter to an individual I'm so glad it
[1:14:44] was included in the
[1:14:46] Bible that can you imagine if you got
[1:14:48] have enough Fai today to be able to not
[1:14:51] add to or take away but to be able to
[1:14:53] read yourself into the
[1:14:58] scripture that this could be called The
[1:15:00] Book of Mary or the book of Wang or the
[1:15:03] book of Joe or the book of
[1:15:05] Tim and almighty God would say I've
[1:15:08] directed one of my servants to speak to
[1:15:11] you this morning to be able to energize
[1:15:15] your faith to help you to not
[1:15:18] acknowledge and understand the power of
[1:15:21] your
[1:15:22] words
[1:15:25] will you get up the end the service and
[1:15:27] say I'm not sure what he was trying to
[1:15:31] say surely he don't think that we can
[1:15:34] live that I
[1:15:42] do but this is the most evil Wicked
[1:15:46] right but you don't believe God can keep
[1:15:49] us I
[1:15:51] do brother Tim said last time 50 years
[1:15:54] now brother Tim 50 years been preaching
[1:15:57] the message of the hour I got saved when
[1:15:59] I was 12 years old I'm now 6 three three

[1:16:07] years oh I bet you regretted you you
[1:16:09] hatte it that you miss so much of your
[1:16:11] young life I don't regret one day of
[1:16:14] serving my Lord
[1:16:16] Jesus and let me just go ahead and tell
[1:16:18] you and shock some of you if there was
[1:16:20] no hell and if there was no Heaven I
[1:16:24] would still choose the same life to live
[1:16:27] the same way to live with these kind of
[1:16:29] people if there was no heaven and there
[1:16:32] was no hell when this life was over I
[1:16:35] just I was annihilated and that was it
[1:16:37] you say you're crazy no I I've enjoyed
[1:16:40] this life so much I would do it all
