[42:12] they've become family to us and and uh I
[42:15] told him I said let's just do this more
[42:17] often so amen amen isn't it good to be a
[42:21] Christian amen if you have your Bibles
[42:23] this evening would like to turn in the
[42:26] scriptures to to uh a very familiar uh
[42:30] portion of scripture there in Malachi 4
[42:32] and verse 5 and also Revelations chapter
[42:36] 1en
[43:00] amen Malachi chap 4 and verse 5 behold I
[43:05] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[43:09] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[43:11] of the Lord and he shall turn the heart
[43:15] of the fathers to the children it's
[43:18] powerful how powerful that this ministry
[43:20] is that it would literally turn the
[43:22] heart of the fathers to the children and
[43:24] the Heart of the children to the fathers
[43:27] lest I come and smite the Earth with a
[43:30] curse Revelations CH 1 verse one and we
[43:33] realize that we are living in this hour
[43:35] we're living in the Fulfillment where
[43:37] we've seen the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[43:40] we are blessed people to be able to say
[43:42] that we understand by by the scriptures
[43:45] by Revelation that that was none other
[43:48] than William Mari and brandham but we
[43:50] just don't want to Simply see brother
[43:52] brandom's portion of scripture we want
[43:55] to see we want to see the great one in
[43:57] the picture we want to see God in the
[43:59] picture we want to see Elijah in the
[44:02] picture and we want to see ourselves in
[44:04] the picture at our hearts have literally
[44:07] been turned back to the apostolic
[44:10] Doctrine amen Revelations chapter
[44:13] 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which
[44:16] God gave unto him to show under the
[44:20] servants things which must surely come
[44:22] to pass and he sent and signified it by
[44:25] his Angel unto his servant vant John who
[44:28] bear record of the word of God and of
[44:30] the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[44:34] things that he saw notice the scripture
[44:37] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[44:40] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[44:43] those things which are written therein
[44:45] for the time is at hand may God bless
[44:48] his word you may be seated tonight in
[44:50] the presence of the Lord and I'd like to
[44:52] continue our thought from last weekend
[44:54] on the understanding of sons and we
[44:57] realize that it is that it is the it is
[45:00] our heart that has been turned to the
[45:02] word that gives us a great understanding
[45:05] of the hour that we are living in for we
[45:07] recognize that this is one of the
[45:08] greatest times to be living in and what
[45:11] the we realize that that the Scribe of
[45:14] This Book of Revelation was John but the
[45:17] author of it was none other than Jesus
[45:19] Christ it is the only book throughout
[45:21] all of history that Jesus Christ
[45:23] literally wrote every single word of
[45:25] when he was here on Earth he stood there
[45:28] and he wiped out he wiped out what he
[45:30] was saying when the when the women were
[45:32] coming where the men were coming against
[45:33] a woman that had been caught into ad
[45:35] dotry he had wrote something in the sand
[45:37] but he wiped it out but this book of
[45:39] Revelation is the only book that was
[45:41] ever written by Jesus Christ and we
[45:44] recognize that by this by this letter
[45:47] that we recognize that there the Bible
[45:49] said that the time is at hand so what is
[45:53] that time it is the time when the
[45:54] revelation of Jesus Christ has been
[45:57] revealed to the body of Christ and
[45:59] Christ has been revealed not a dead God
[46:02] but in alive Living God right here
[46:05] amongst us and brother brandom said in
[46:07] the church and its condition he said so
[46:09] what could be any more better he said be
[46:11] any better for us to do today than to
[46:14] know that we are at the church for to
[46:17] EMB better ourselves or to broaden our
[46:20] understanding he said how many would say
[46:22] that's what I'm here for Lord see let's
[46:24] see I want a better understanding he
[46:27] said if we're going to have an
[46:29] understanding of God it must come out of
[46:31] God's word for the word is what God gave
[46:34] us to feed our hungry Souls so if we're
[46:38] going to EMB better ourselves if we're
[46:39] going to have a deeper Revelation if
[46:41] we're going to have a greater
[46:43] understanding we've got to Garner it
[46:45] right out of the very word of God and we
[46:47] don't want an intellectual understanding
[46:49] we don't want a knowledge of of
[46:51] intellectual knowledge but we literally
[46:53] want a revelation from almighty God to
[46:56] come sweeping down throughout the
[46:58] portals of heaven and begin to transfer
[47:01] us from this world of mortality into a
[47:04] world of immortality and and Jesus when
[47:07] Jesus would teach we know that when
[47:09] Jesus would teach that Jesus would use
[47:12] he would use he would use Parables and
[47:14] his disciples would ask him said why are
[47:16] you always talking to the people in
[47:18] riddles why are you always talking to
[47:20] them in Parables and he said it in this
[47:22] way in Matthew 13:11 he said because it
[47:25] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[47:27] of the kingdom of God but to them that
[47:29] it but to them it's not given and it's
[47:32] so powerful to recognize that you
[47:35] understand what the master has been
[47:37] laying out the things that he's been
[47:39] that others can't see that others can't
[47:41] understand he's given it unto a
[47:43] generation to a people that can believe
[47:46] and a people that can understand who
[47:48] they are and have found their position
[47:50] by the preaching of the word they
[47:53] understand that they're living in a
[47:54] powerful moment of time and to me as a
[47:57] minister one of the coolest things that
[47:59] you can or maybe I shouldn't say it that
[48:01] probably ain't the preacher way to say
[48:02] it but one of the coolest things to say
[48:04] or the greatest things to say is to
[48:06] watch literally Revelation strike
[48:09] somebody it's one of the neatest things
[48:11] that you've ever watched you see
[48:12] somebody that's struggling on something
[48:14] or you see somebody that's maybe dealing
[48:16] with water baptism and they don't
[48:18] understand it or or they don't
[48:19] understand the godhead but it's one of
[48:21] the greatest things to be able to watch
[48:23] them as you begin to preach the word of
[48:25] God as the Revelation begins to drop in
[48:29] they begin to get illuminated by the
[48:30] preaching of the word and you literally
[48:32] see the light bulb come on I can imagine
[48:35] all these teachers that are sitting here
[48:37] that they have been throughout College
[48:38] Years they've spent time studying and
[48:40] they they spent some time looking at
[48:42] different things of how that they can
[48:44] teach a little child how that they can
[48:46] learn I think it's a powerful thing for
[48:49] for a teacher to be able to look out
[48:50] there and they studied these things
[48:52] they've looked at it but now they take
[48:54] what they have learned and they begin to
[48:56] drop it over to those students and then
[48:59] they begin to catch what the teacher has
[49:01] been giving out to them and then the
[49:03] light bulb comes on I'd say that's a
[49:05] powerful thing when a teacher can stand
[49:07] there and say I've done my job and they
[49:09] can move on to the next grade but this
[49:12] what has been given out no man has
[49:14] anything to do with this no preacher has
[49:17] anything to do with this except by the
[49:19] preaching of the word I if I learned you
[49:21] how to have the Holy Ghost somebody
[49:23] could learn you out of it if I learned
[49:25] you how to be heal somebody could learn
[49:28] you out of it but it's a powerful thing
[49:30] when Revelation strikes you because no
[49:33] devil can take it away from you no man
[49:35] can take it away from you no Doctrine
[49:37] can take it away from you but simply by
[49:40] the preaching of the word and Revelation
[49:42] strikes your heart what is it it's the
[49:45] preaching of the word that brings a
[49:47] revelation to a people that they have an
[49:49] understanding that he's talking about
[49:53] me it's like an artist it's like an
[49:56] artist a teach or somebody that's that's
[49:58] before a class and they're they're
[50:00] literally trying to teach a class how to
[50:03] draw out a certain figure or something i
[50:05] i s and I I said a while back and I I
[50:08] watched a teacher as they were they were
[50:10] teaching a an art class people that had
[50:13] wanted to sit down in a in a in a in a
[50:15] great arena there and wanting to draw
[50:17] something and the the teacher up on the
[50:20] platform had the idea of what he was
[50:22] going to teach to them before he ever
[50:25] let it out of his mouth and he would
[50:27] literally tell them now do this and the
[50:29] people would do that and they by the end
[50:32] of it they literally had what the
[50:34] teacher had they had it on their paper
[50:37] and that's exactly what Jesus Christ has
[50:40] done he has stood here and he's given us
[50:42] an understanding there's nobody that
[50:44] could nobody else could do it nobody
[50:47] else could put it on the paper nobody
[50:49] else could make it clear but there was
[50:51] somebody up in the portals of heaven and
[50:53] said this is my generation this is my
[50:56] belie Believers this is my hour I've got
[50:59] to give her an understanding that's what
[51:01] we watch in the Book of Revelation is
[51:03] that God in his artwork begin to draw
[51:06] out he started out in the beginning of
[51:08] Revelations 1 he draw in the certain
[51:11] parts of who Jesus was in his beginning
[51:14] but then you go down all the way to the
[51:16] end of the book of Revelation and the
[51:18] artwork has come into full view there
[51:21] Jesus Christ is not sitting alone but
[51:24] he's sitting there with his Queen to be
[51:26] he's sitting there with his
[51:28] wife Hallelujah brother bham said in the
[51:32] revelation of Jesus he said the
[51:34] importance of Revelation by the spirit
[51:36] to a True Believer can never be
[51:38] overemphasized he said Revelation means
[51:41] more to you than perhaps you realize he
[51:43] said now I'm not talking about the Book
[51:45] of Revelation and you he said I am
[51:47] talking about all Revelation he said it
[51:50] is tremendously important to the church
[51:54] it is tremendously important to the
[51:56] church church then brother brandom goes
[51:58] in there to Matthew chapter 16 that we
[52:00] know that Jesus be to ask them whom do
[52:03] men say that I the son of manham and
[52:05] then he be to teach there brother ROM
[52:07] begin to teach on what the church was
[52:09] built on it was not built on a man but
[52:12] it was built it was not even built upon
[52:14] the man Jesus Christ but it was built
[52:17] upon the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[52:20] was and what is a revelation it is
[52:24] simply faith is a revelation because
[52:27] faith has been revealed to you because
[52:29] we realize we pick it up in Hebrews
[52:31] chapter 11 and the Bible said that by
[52:34] faith Abel offered a greater sacrifice
[52:37] or more excellent sacrifice than that of
[52:39] Cain by faith Noah built an ark by faith
[52:42] Enoch walked by faith Abraham believed
[52:45] God by faith Moses forsook the things of
[52:48] Egypt it's by faith that gives you a
[52:51] revelation to recognize the hour that
[52:54] you're living in now Paul would say in 1
[52:57] Thessalonians 2 and 13 for this cause
[53:00] also thank we god without ceasing
[53:02] because when you receive the word of God
[53:05] which you heard of us you received it
[53:07] not as the word of men but as in the
[53:10] truth the word of God which effectly
[53:13] effectually worketh also in you that
[53:17] believe how many thankful to be a
[53:20] believer here tonight so we're watching
[53:22] the physical we're watching the
[53:25] Revelation begin to work in you that
[53:28] believe now the Bible said in
[53:30] Deuteronomy 4:5 behold I have taught you
[53:33] statutes and judgments even as the Lord
[53:36] my God commanded me that you should do
[53:38] so in the land whether you go to possess
[53:41] it notice he said keep therefore and do
[53:44] them he's given the he's given his
[53:47] children statutes and judge judgments
[53:50] that land that you're going to go in
[53:52] there he said now keep them therefore
[53:55] and do them he said for this is your
[53:57] wisdom and your understanding in the
[53:59] sight of the Nations so if you're going
[54:01] to have any knowledge if you're going to
[54:03] have any understanding you've got to
[54:05] keep the law that God has given unto
[54:08] them that this would be your sight that
[54:10] this would be your wisdom and your
[54:12] understanding in the sight of the
[54:13] Nations which shall hear all these
[54:16] statues and say surely this great nation
[54:19] is a wise and an understanding people
[54:22] I'd say that that is the same way that
[54:24] the Nations have to look upon the body
[54:26] of Jesus Christ whether they receive it
[54:28] or not but there is a people in this
[54:30] land that recognize who they are they've
[54:34] been given a wisdom from Heaven they've
[54:36] been given an understanding from heaven
[54:39] for what nation is there so great who
[54:42] have God so nigh unto them as the Lord
[54:45] our God is in all things that we call
[54:49] upon him
[54:51] foro I don't know if you just catching
[54:53] what I'm putting down but you have a
[54:55] partnership with of
[54:57] Heaven you didn't get this understanding
[54:59] on your own you didn't get this from a
[55:01] pull pit you didn't get this from a book
[55:04] you didn't get this from seven steps of
[55:06] a book that you bought at Barnes & Noble
[55:08] you have a partnership you have an
[55:11] authority you have Heaven on your
[55:14] side you have a father and a son
[55:17] relationship that he's literally taking
[55:19] you through the scriptures he's guiding
[55:21] you through the scriptures he's teaching
[55:24] you through the scriptures he's he's not
[55:26] going to let you fail he's not going to
[55:28] let you fall he's not going to let you
[55:31] give up it's a relationship that he
[55:34] ordained by almighty God he set this
[55:39] up
[55:43] Hallelujah now we know that by the
[55:46] message and we recognize that Redemption
[55:49] has two parts that has two parts it's a
[55:52] coming out of and it's a going into
[55:55] that's why William br would say that
[55:57] there's got to be another Ephesians he
[56:00] said it's literally of coming out of
[56:01] unbelief and going into Faith he said
[56:04] it's another Ephesians he said it's a
[56:07] another Exodus as we would say it like
[56:09] that because Exodus means to come out of
[56:12] and we recognize the hour that we're
[56:14] living in we're living in the hour of
[56:16] the Third Exodus is that right but we
[56:19] recognize when we saw a prophet and a
[56:21] pillar of fire show up in the fir in the
[56:24] first Exodus it was a sign know that the
[56:27] first Exodus was at hand and at the
[56:29] second Exodus the prophet was the pillar
[56:32] of fire but in this generation in the
[56:34] Third Exodus the prophet and the pillar
[56:36] fire Has Come Again by the same anointed
[56:39] pillar fire and the same anointed system
[56:42] to bring a people from a spiritual
[56:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost into a
[56:47] spiritual land of our future
[56:50] home Hallelujah that's what he said he
[56:53] said we must have an exodus to come out
[56:56] out and to go into for the
[56:59] Rapture tell somebody I'm in
[57:02] that I'm in that and that is exactly
[57:06] what the message of the hour has done it
[57:08] brought us out of systems it brought us
[57:11] out of bad situations it brought us out
[57:13] of chaos and it placed us in a position
[57:16] that Sons and Daughters of God are
[57:18] destined for that's what the message did
[57:21] for you you couldn't have done it on
[57:23] your own when William Brandon preaches
[57:25] on May the 10 of 59 he preaches a sermon
[57:28] on Mother's Day and there brother random
[57:30] goes in there and he starts talking
[57:32] about when we begin to get on that side
[57:34] and we begin to see Jesus in his
[57:37] glorified body and we'll have a body
[57:39] like his glorious body brother bam said
[57:42] that there he will come and take his

[59:55] Andrew we ain't fully got there to them
[59:57] days I got bad news for you I'm
[1:00:01] there you said we ain't went far enough
[1:00:03] in our Doctrine I'm sorry I
[1:00:06] have said well I don't believe it like
[1:00:08] that I have I do I understand what the
[1:00:12] prophet said about this I understand
[1:00:14] what he said about this generation I'm
[1:00:16] not going down in
[1:00:18] defeat when job was lacking
[1:00:21] understanding a revelation sweeped down
[1:00:23] from heaven and gave him an
[1:00:26] understanding when he asked him job
[1:00:28] where was you where was you job I didn't
[1:00:32] see you in defeat I saw you shouting for
[1:00:36] joy and I want to tell Full Gospel
[1:00:38] Lighthouse you've had some times of
[1:00:40] mourning but it's time that you start
[1:00:43] living out the part that God seen you
[1:00:47] [Applause]
[1:00:51] in oh Blessed
[1:00:54] Be name of the Lord
[1:00:57] Blessed Be y'all know that y'all know
[1:01:00] that story when brother brandom brother
[1:01:03] brandom's up there hunting he's
[1:01:04] literally he's up there hunting he said
[1:01:06] it was like a real hazy foggy morning
[1:01:09] and he said I looked out there and he
[1:01:11] said out in front of me he said was
[1:01:13] three rainbows that was perfectly in
[1:01:15] line he said and he said I started
[1:01:17] walking to them how could they be how
[1:01:19] could them things be because William
[1:01:21] brandham had an understanding he had an
[1:01:24] understanding that that rainbow
[1:01:25] shouldn't be there but there was a
[1:01:27] supernatural element about William
[1:01:29] brandham that called him to walk to that
[1:01:31] to walk to that rainbow and he said I
[1:01:33] started walking and he said it was like
[1:01:36] the holy spirit said that's close enough
[1:01:38] right there brother he said then I begin
[1:01:40] to scream out oh God what would you have
[1:01:43] your servant to know and a voice
[1:01:45] screamed out that Jehovah of the old is
[1:01:48] Jesus Christ of the new he said it was
[1:01:50] simply confirming to me that all of my
[1:01:53] years of ministry was not in vain he
[1:01:55] said it was a confirmation that my
[1:01:57] message of him was right in line so the
[1:02:01] message that you have received it's not
[1:02:03] a message of William brandom it's a
[1:02:05] message of
[1:02:07] him it's a message of Christ it's a
[1:02:10] message of the anointed one it's a
[1:02:12] message of the Messiah and I dare let

[1:05:35] Whitney we all knew it all the Spencers
[1:05:37] knew we Whitney was getting a horse and
[1:05:39] I'm pretty sure dad was packing a
[1:05:40] baseball bag or a shotgun to take care

[1:06:44] didn't the secret had been given away
[1:06:48] but in this generation it was a secret
[1:06:51] time for a secret moment that the time
[1:06:53] was at hand that even brother said that
[1:06:56] when when Spurgeon Spurgeon set his
[1:06:58] writers down and said don't took that
[1:07:00] don't touch that book of Revelation
[1:07:02] because there's coming a prophet in the
[1:07:04] last day and he'll reveal those things
[1:07:08] because it's at this time William
[1:07:11] brandham said William Bram said it in
[1:07:13] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[1:07:14] said he was letting out his Secrets he
[1:07:18] was revealing he was Reve he was letting
[1:07:21] it
[1:07:22] out when you let it out you can't get it
[1:07:25] back
[1:07:26] right it couldn't they couldn't get
[1:07:28] Whitney back to sleep after
[1:07:30] that let me tell you how can you L us
[1:07:33] back to sleep in Le
[1:07:37] Osa I done heard a secret I done heard
[1:07:40] that he's
[1:07:42] coming it's done let out he's done
[1:07:45] revealed himself he's here he's coming
[1:07:49] don't you worry don't give up don't back
[1:07:52] off he's coming
[1:07:56] what is it Revelation Webster says that
[1:07:58] Revelation or reveal means to make known
[1:08:01] and he goes in Webster would go on to
[1:08:04] say that reveal in Divine truth that
[1:08:06] Revelation
[1:08:08] means brother man picks it up said the
[1:08:10] Revelation it is Christ's way of making
[1:08:13] himself known to his church I love what
[1:08:16] brother brandom goes on and does here in
[1:08:18] Christ of mystery he goes into Matthew
[1:08:21] chapter 16 and whom the men say that I
[1:08:23] the son of man am and then he goes in
[1:08:25] into Matthew 17 on Mount Transfiguration
[1:08:29] and it goes right back in to Matthew 16
[1:08:32] of whom the men say that out of the son
[1:08:34] of man him because there we recognize
[1:08:37] that in Matthew 17 that Jesus Takes with
[1:08:39] him Peter James and John up there and he
[1:08:42] takes him up there it's faith hope and
[1:08:44] charity that he takes up there and he
[1:08:46] goes up there and there they begin to
[1:08:48] see Elijah and Moses and Jesus and his
[1:08:52] body Shone with the glory of the Lord
[1:08:56] and Peter said it's good for us to be
[1:08:58] here let us build three
[1:09:01] Tabernacles you see where a c where he
[1:09:03] was living at he was living in the
[1:09:05] moment because they were still thinking
[1:09:07] at that time that he was going to be a
[1:09:09] general or a warrior but you see he
[1:09:12] could not take them into Matthew 17
[1:09:15] without them going into Matthew 16
[1:09:17] there's got to be a revelation before
[1:09:19] there can be a
[1:09:22] Transfiguration are you with me before
[1:09:24] you can be trans figured you have got to
[1:09:27] have a revelation of who he is and the
[1:09:30] Bible said that there came a cloud and
[1:09:33] out of the cloud came a voice and said
[1:09:35] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[1:09:38] pleased hear ye him and when it was gone
[1:09:42] away they saw no man but Jesus they saw
[1:09:47] no man but Jesus and when the message
[1:09:50] turns your eyes you don't just see
[1:09:53] elaser you see
[1:09:57] Isaac you don't just see William brandom
[1:09:59] in that picture you see the pillar of
[1:10:01] fire in that picture what was it the
[1:10:04] message turned your thinking you don't
[1:10:06] think them kind of thoughts no more
[1:10:09] there's a lot of people that look at
[1:10:11] that picture of pillar of fire that
[1:10:13] happened in Sam Houston Coliseum down
[1:10:15] there and all they see is William
[1:10:17] brandham but to you and I we see
[1:10:19] Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angel over
[1:10:22] Revelations 10:7
[1:10:26] what was it the message turned what is
[1:10:29] it it's a sign that supreme power is
[1:10:33] right here that supreme power is with
[1:10:36] this message well I don't know if I can
[1:10:38] I don't know if I can go all that way
[1:10:40] let me tell you that William brandham
[1:10:41] said that the angel of the Lord
[1:10:43] accompanies the message wherever it goes
[1:10:46] so I can say that supreme authority is
[1:10:50] here if you can recognize your position
[1:10:53] that supreme power
[1:10:55] that supreme authority that Supreme
[1:10:58] judgment that a supreme word is here
[1:11:01] what happened in this
[1:11:03] generation what happened out there in

[1:11:17] him to go back

[1:17:11] I was videoing on that camera and he
[1:17:13] said he said all of a sudden he said he
[1:17:14] said that great big horse is coming he
[1:17:16] said he said it zoomed in real quick and
[1:17:18] come in there he said he said all of a
[1:17:21] sudden he said I turned around and he
[1:17:23] said that horse was just shuttering and
[1:17:25] completely calmed down he said and I
[1:17:27] turned around and he said brother
[1:17:29] brandham was putting his hat back
[1:17:32] on brother Bisal said that even nature
[1:17:35] had to testify that he was a
[1:17:39] prophet you know when we was here when
[1:17:42] we was having brother Steve Thomas's
[1:17:44] funeral how many was here that
[1:17:46] day he was here it's a sign we had
[1:17:50] brother Steve Thomas' funeral this been
[1:17:52] told a 100,000 times but we're going to
[1:17:53] tell it again because this ain't our
[1:17:55] story this is his story we had brother
[1:17:58] Steve Thomas laid out here in in his
[1:18:00] casket of be beautiful beautiful
[1:18:02] decoration and we' asked for a special
[1:18:05] privilege from almighty God to come and
[1:18:06] hold us up in that service and people
[1:18:10] throughout this building begin to
[1:18:11] testify that they saw the pillar of fire
[1:18:14] hanging over the ministry while they
[1:18:15] were delivering the word and the pillar
[1:18:17] of fire sweeped across where we had
[1:18:20] these bouquet of flowers and the pillar
[1:18:22] fire as it swooped across flowers begin
[1:18:25] to open up in the
[1:18:28] presence of the
[1:18:30] sunlight what am I saying unto you
[1:18:32] you've been given an understanding to
[1:18:34] recognize that you're not alone in this
[1:18:36] world and if you're not alone if nature
[1:18:39] testifies that we're not alone how much
[1:18:42] more should you give witness do I have a
[1:18:45] witness that there's a people that
[1:18:47] understand who they
[1:18:50] are when they looked up there they
[1:18:52] didn't see Moses had seen Elijah
[1:18:55] they saw Jesus
[1:18:58] only what was it when Moses was up there
[1:19:01] on Mount SII it simply changed his face
[1:19:05] when he come down he had to put a veil
[1:19:07] over his face he said the shepherd
[1:19:09] Prophet Moses he said who Jehovah was in
[1:19:12] in a portion he said just a portion he
[1:19:15] he said his face he had the word in his
[1:19:18] mouth he said but notice when the Great
[1:19:21] Shepherd was in the presence of the
[1:19:22] shakina what did it do it changed his
[1:19:25] whole countenance he said he wasn't just
[1:19:28] a part of God he was all of God he was
[1:19:31] Emmanuel he said that's why it had to be
[1:19:35] Shepherds because you are living in an
[1:19:38] hour that you understand that you're not
[1:19:41] feeding on the mind of a man but you're
[1:19:44] feeding on supreme power on supreme
[1:19:48] authority when Jesus is there in Matthew
[1:19:50] chapter 4 and Satan begins to tempt him
[1:19:53] with the kingdoms of the world world and
[1:19:55] said if you'll do this I'll give you all
[1:19:57] of the kingdoms of the
[1:19:58] world Jesus simply answered him with it
[1:20:02] is written brother random said that
[1:20:05] Satan was wondering he said but Jesus
[1:20:07] Knew by experience Satan knew it by
[1:20:11] knowledge he said but Jesus knew it by
[1:20:14] an experience that he was the son of God
[1:20:17] and by the token Life by the power by
[1:20:21] the anointing you understand
[1:20:27] you understand by an experience you
[1:20:30] don't have to take no thought what
[1:20:31] you're going to say Jesus said when it
[1:20:33] comes to your time he said because of me
[1:20:35] you're going to be delivered up there
[1:20:37] into the synagogues you're going to be
[1:20:39] delivered before the prisons he said but
[1:20:41] take no thought what you're going to
[1:20:44] say that's what the scripture said he
[1:20:46] said he said and it shall turn to you
[1:20:49] for a testimony notice in Luke 21-14
[1:20:52] settle it therefore in your hearts
[1:20:55] not to meditate before what you shall
[1:20:57] answer for I will give you a
[1:21:04] mouth where's the word at in this
[1:21:06] generation it wasn't in our

[1:21:18] bitter Waters I know it'll cause a war

[1:21:27] Apostles as long it was in their mouth
[1:21:30] and that word will never fail in your
[1:21:32] mouth I will give you a

[1:23:00] every gate in hell has been stopped by
[1:23:03] this revelation of not William Branham
[1:23:05] of not a church but by Jesus
[1:23:09] Christ when Peter and John walked by the
[1:23:11] beautiful gate that day and there laid
[1:23:13] that man had laid there all them days
[1:23:15] when Jesus went to the synagogue there
[1:23:17] his boys walked up there and said today
[1:23:20] is your day said look on us such as I
[1:23:23] have give I Thee in the the name of
[1:23:24] Jesus Christ rise up and
[1:23:30] walk let me tell you something what the
[1:23:31] scripture said and he ran
[1:23:34] leaping he ran leaping when's the last
[1:23:37] time you leaped your way to church
[1:23:40] when's the last time you danced yourself
[1:23:42] to church when's the last time you had
[1:23:44] such a prayer meeting that you came in
[1:23:46] here speaking in tongues drunk on the
[1:23:48] Holy Ghost when's the last time well if
[1:23:51] it ain't if it's been a long time look
[1:23:54] on on
[1:23:57] us look on us when's the last time you
[1:24:01] had a prayer meeting and you broke
[1:24:03] through and all of Heaven came down
[1:24:06] when's the last time that you got so
[1:24:08] drunk on the holy ghost that you didn't
[1:24:10] know what your name
[1:24:16] was and the Bible said in chapter
[1:24:19] 4 that when the Pharisees and the
[1:24:22] captains and the Chiefs when they came
[1:24:24] before for them he said the Bible said
[1:24:26] that they took knowledge that these men
[1:24:29] had been with
[1:24:31] Jesus why you acting the way you're
[1:24:33] acting let them take knowledge that
[1:24:35] we've been with Jesus let them take
[1:24:38] knowledge that cancer has to Bow because
[1:24:40] we've been with Jesus let them take
[1:24:42] knowledge that barness has to Bow
[1:24:45] because we've been with Jesus let them
[1:24:47] take
[1:24:49] knowledge I've been with Christ let him
[1:24:52] take
[1:24:55] let them take knowledge this ain't
[1:24:57] Pentecost this ain't a restoration of
[1:24:59] gifts this is a restoring of the true
[1:25:03] baptism of the Holy
[1:25:09] Ghost come on somebody we didn't get our
[1:25:12] criteria out of a man's book we didn't
[1:25:15] get our criteria out of some Creed we
[1:25:18] got our crer out of Acts chapter 2
[1:25:31] I'll tell you what the Bible said the
[1:25:33] Bible said that deacons had such an
[1:25:37] understanding that the Bible said in
[1:25:39] Acts chapter8 and the people with one
[1:25:42] Accord gave heed unto those things which
[1:25:44] philli spoke hearing and seeing the
[1:25:47] Miracles which he
[1:25:50] did this Deacon had an understanding
[1:25:54] that he stood up and preached the
[1:25:57] word that all of them gave heed to what
[1:26:00] Philip spoke hearing and seeing the
[1:26:02] Miracles which he did the preacher
[1:26:05] didn't do it the Deacon did it come on
[1:26:09] somebody it ain't just brother Ron's job
[1:26:12] it ain't just brother Andrew's job it
[1:26:14] ain't just brother William's job it
[1:26:16] ain't brother just brother Matthew and
[1:26:18] brother Matthew's job it's your job I
[1:26:21] tell you what this is showing is that
[1:26:23] deacons have more power sometimes than
[1:26:25] some Pentecostal
[1:26:27] preachers that they had to take
[1:26:29] knowledge by The Miracles and the Divine
[1:26:32] gifts that was there in which Philip
[1:26:38] done well I tell you what it's time that
[1:26:42] some Churches turn loose their churches
[1:26:45] back to the deacons if the preachers
[1:26:47] can't produce signs and
[1:26:52] miracles come on somebody if we're a
[1:26:54] Mark 16 church and we're a church in
[1:26:57] action then there's got to be signs
[1:26:59] following
[1:27:02] us come on I'm not teaching you
[1:27:04] something new I'm teaching you Bible
[1:27:12] Doctrine come on if AA Allen could stand
[1:27:15] out there while he was
[1:27:18] drunk while he was drunk stand out there
[1:27:22] and preach the word as a
[1:27:25] drunkard preach the
[1:27:28] word read some of these same scriptures
[1:27:31] that you
[1:27:32] read take people by their feet go watch
[1:27:36] it on YouTube take them by their feet
[1:27:39] and their feet grow out three
[1:27:42] inches take people that ain't got no
[1:27:45] voice ain't got a voice and after he
[1:27:49] prays for them they turn loose singing
[1:27:52] like a mocking bird
[1:27:57] leave that meeting go get in a car and a
[1:28:01] brother that was a preacher in this
[1:28:02] message said he would watch him go up
[1:28:04] there to the liquor store people watched
[1:28:07] him check into hotel rooms under the
[1:28:09] name of William brandham and go under
[1:28:12] there and live with a prostitute for a
[1:28:14] night you see how Wicked he was a
[1:28:17] drunkard and do them kinds of things but
[1:28:20] the
[1:28:22] anointing come on
[1:28:24] the anointing of an Angel was released
[1:28:27] in this generation and men were
[1:28:30] operating under the power of an Angelic
[1:28:33] meeting in this
[1:28:36] generation because the Covenant is not
[1:28:39] built upon who you are the Covenant is
[1:28:41] built on faith and them people thought
[1:28:44] they were watching
[1:28:46] Jesus come on
[1:28:49] now now maybe I'm like
[1:28:52] Gideon if God before us then where be
[1:28:55] all of his
[1:28:57] miracles if or
[1:29:00] Roberts if AA Allen if Jack co could
[1:29:04] have that and not live right I'm not
[1:29:06] saying anything about them other
[1:29:08] brothers I don't know their entire life
[1:29:10] but they were not your Prophet
[1:29:14] messenger AA Allen had so many miracles
[1:29:18] but live such a dirty life if them
[1:29:21] brothers could stand there and pre pre
[1:29:24] this gospel and produce them type of
[1:29:27] Miracles how about you
[1:29:30] Housewives how about you little
[1:29:36] girls if God be for
[1:29:39] us if God be for using where be all of

[1:30:08] deadly thing and it shall not harm

[1:30:25] will be
[1:30:26] Miracles come on somebody he said I am
[1:30:29] the vine and you are the branches and if
[1:30:31] you be in me and my word by being you
[1:30:34] abide ask what you will and it shall be
[1:30:36] given unto
[1:30:38] you come on somebody you have watched a
[1:30:41] bunch of grafted lemons grafted onto an
[1:30:44] orange tree but William brandham said if
[1:30:47] that orange tree ever brings forth
[1:30:49] another Branch it'll produce oranges
[1:30:54] that's why you're a continuation of the
[1:30:56] book of Acts that's why there's Miracles
[1:30:58] following you that's why signs are
[1:31:00] following you you're a
[1:31:04] branch and the same life is Flowing from

[1:35:43] Living
[1:35:45] God we have a blood we have a token in
[1:35:49] this day we've been given a token which
[1:35:51] is an antitype of the type of the
[1:35:53] natural token we've been given the
[1:35:56] supernatural Supreme token all that
[1:35:59] foreshadowed was been has been given to
[1:36:01] this generation has been given a token
[1:36:04] and now we have the Holy Ghost is our
[1:36:06] token it is our identification that we
[1:36:09] have accepted the death of the Lamb Not
[1:36:10] only was Jesus a human life to come back
[1:36:13] on us but it was
[1:36:15] God himself manifested in the flesh that
[1:36:19] brought back upon us the adoption of
[1:36:22] sons
[1:36:26] I'm going to read it again it was God
[1:36:29] himself manifested in flesh that brought
[1:36:32] back upon us the adoption of sons that
[1:36:35] now we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:38] God that is the
[1:36:42] token it is our identification of the
[1:36:45] Passover it's our identification that we
[1:36:47] have believe God and God has accepted
[1:36:50] us how do I get adopted brother Andrew
[1:36:54] Acts 2 and
[1:36:56] 38 come on somebody receive you the Holy
[1:37:00] Ghost for the Bible said in that Romans
[1:37:02] 8:14 for as many as are led by the
[1:37:04] spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:37:07] for you have not received the spirit of
[1:37:09] bondage again to fear but you have
[1:37:11] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:37:13] we cry ABA father you have not receed
[1:37:17] the spirit of of bondage again because
[1:37:20] you see they were living under the old
[1:37:23] Covenant of the law which required Works
[1:37:27] which required a performance-based life
[1:37:29] which depends upon man
[1:37:32] sufficiency which simply produces
[1:37:34] spiritual bondage that's right that's
[1:37:39] right the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:37:43] with our spirit that we
[1:37:45] are the children of God you see by the
[1:37:50] Cross by Jesus giving his life at the
[1:37:52] cross living by the New Covenant of
[1:37:55] Grace it provides not a
[1:37:57] performance-based life but a
[1:38:00] relationship based
[1:38:02] life
[1:38:03] Hallelujah you're not depending on your
[1:38:05] own Works you're not depending on your
[1:38:08] own self but you're depending upon God's
[1:38:11] sufficiency so therefore this
[1:38:14] relationship that you have with the body
[1:38:17] and the headship it it brings about a
[1:38:20] relationship that results in in
[1:38:24] spiritual
[1:38:27] Liberty and as the Bible said that where
[1:38:31] the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:38:33] Liberty let me tell you this Liberty
[1:38:35] that this message has brought to you it
[1:38:37] has not only given you a power and a
[1:38:39] liberty to shout it's not only giving
[1:38:41] you a liberty to dance and to speak but
[1:38:44] it's given you Liberties to act like a
[1:38:47] Son of God like Mark 11 and speak to the
[1:38:50] mountain be thou cast from here to
[1:38:52] Yonder it's given you a liberty to allow
[1:38:55] signs to follow you come on somebody
[1:38:59] this message has given you a liberty to
[1:39:01] live a holy life this message has given
[1:39:04] you a liberty to dress right according
[1:39:06] to Deuteronomy 22 and5 this message has
[1:39:10] given you a liberty to speak the word
[1:39:13] under Authority like Matthew chapter 8
[1:39:16] when the Centurian came to him and he
[1:39:18] said I have a servant that lay sick in
[1:39:20] my home he said don't you ain't got to
[1:39:23] come into my house but simply speak the
[1:39:25] word and my servant will be healed and
[1:39:28] Jesus said I have found not so great a
[1:39:31] faith all in all of Israel in this man
[1:39:34] because he understood
[1:39:36] Authority and Jesus goes in Matthew 9
[1:39:39] and he declares and he does Miracles
[1:39:41] because he watched we are watching the
[1:39:43] son of man in his authority and in
[1:39:46] Matthew chapter 10 he turns around and
[1:39:48] gives that same power back to the Church
[1:39:51] of the Living God and then he turns when
[1:39:54] Luke picks up what Jesus does he picks
[1:39:57] it up in Luke 10:18 and he says and he
[1:40:00] said unto them I behold Satan last
[1:40:02] lightning falling from
[1:40:07] Heaven what was it it was when the
[1:40:09] church was receiving her power that
[1:40:12] Satan lost his
[1:40:15] position is that right it was when the
[1:40:18] church received her power that Satan
[1:40:21] lost his position and it's the same way
[1:40:25] every single time that a son and
[1:40:27] daughter of God grabs a hold of a
[1:40:29] revelation Satan loses his
[1:40:33] power come on somebody when you grab a
[1:40:36] hold of something and said I'm not a
[1:40:38] slave to fear no more Satan loses his
[1:40:41] power when you reach up there said I'm
[1:40:43] not a spirit of fear I'm not a spirit of
[1:40:45] bondage I've not received those things
[1:40:48] but he's come to give me a sound mind of
[1:40:50] peace and of life and since they
[1:40:53] Gabrielle it's his
[1:40:57] mind
[1:41:00] Hallelujah I'll tell you what you ought
[1:41:01] to do you ought to cast that devil out
[1:41:04] that's what Jesus did when he came here
[1:41:06] he cast that devil out and that's what
[1:41:08] William Brenham said in the greatest
[1:41:10] battle every fought that God's Army is
[1:41:12] commissioned to do the same thing kick
[1:41:15] him
[1:41:18] out ah I'm coming I'm bringing it to you
[1:41:21] Revelations 12:9 and the Great Dragon
[1:41:24] was cast out that old serpent called the
[1:41:27] devil call him anything you want to cast
[1:41:30] him out which deceiveth the whole world
[1:41:33] he was cast out in the earth and the
[1:41:35] Angels were cast out with him and I
[1:41:38] heard a loud voice saying in heaven now
[1:41:40] has come
[1:41:43] salvation I'm saying this to you don't
[1:41:46] wait one more
[1:41:49] moment you live one more second with the
[1:41:52] devil it's too long
[1:41:55] now it's come my salvation I'm free from
[1:41:59] Pain I'm free from torment I'm free from
[1:42:02] anxiety I'm free from depression I'm
[1:42:05] free from pain in my body I'm free from
[1:42:07] Leota I'm Sav from sickness I'm saved
[1:42:11] from
[1:42:14] depression and now has come salvation
[1:42:17] and strengthen the kingdom of our God
[1:42:19] and the power of His Christ for the
[1:42:21] accuser of our brethren is cast down
[1:42:24] which accuse them before our God day and
[1:42:26] night and they overcame him by the blood
[1:42:30] of the lamb and by the word of their
[1:42:32] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:42:34] under the
[1:42:38] death it's time to have yourself in
[1:42:40] Exodus
[1:42:42] 15 it's time to sing the song of
[1:42:45] Moses you got the blood on the door you

[1:42:50] done watched him in Exodus 13 you done
[1:42:52] watch watch him in Exodus 14 as a pillar
[1:42:55] of fire came
[1:42:59] down the rest of the world don't want to
[1:43:01] identify it but there at the Red Sea
[1:43:05] it's still a sign that the pillar of
[1:43:08] fire came down and stood between
[1:43:11] them and all of Egypt that when the
[1:43:15] shores go back on the Red Sea you can
[1:43:18] still see smoldering sand that has
[1:43:21] burned been burnt in place where
[1:43:23] Footprints are still here 4,000 years
[1:43:27] later it's a sign that we will walk
[1:43:31] over we will come out and we will
[1:43:36] leave come on somebody it's time that
[1:43:40] you go into your Exodus 15 Hallelujah

[1:43:49] dwell in them I'm saying that this
[1:43:52] message has given you Liberty to
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:11] Rejoice sister Gabrielle I was woke up
[1:44:14] real early this morning and I had this
[1:44:16] thought on my
[1:44:18] heart it just kept coming to me just
[1:44:21] kept coming to me and we're here
[1:44:25] tell them it's their season to
[1:44:30] Rejoice it's your
[1:44:32] season it's your
[1:44:36] season now I ain't telling you that by
[1:44:38] my emotions and I'm not telling you by
[1:44:40] that by Illusions I'm telling you that
[1:44:42] by the word of the Lord therefore
[1:44:45] Rejoice can I give you some scriptures
[1:44:47] for your season that you're in Psalms 32
[1:44:50] and11 I'm coming down be glad in the
[1:44:52] Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout
[1:44:55] for Joy all ye that are upright in heart
[1:44:59] verse chapter 31 And1 rejoice in the
[1:45:02] Lord oh ye righteous for praise is
[1:45:05] comely for the upright praise the Lord
[1:45:07] with a harp sing unto him with a salry
[1:45:10] and an instrument of 10 strings sing
[1:45:12] unto him a new song play skillfully with
[1:45:15] a loud noise for the Lord for the word
[1:45:18] of the Lord is right and all his works
[1:45:21] are done in truth and when Jesus had
[1:45:24] given the church power and Satan had
[1:45:27] fallen like lightning he stood there in
[1:45:29] verse 10 chapter Luke 10: 20 and said
[1:45:32] not withstanding in this Rejoice not
[1:45:35] that the spirits are subject to you but
[1:45:38] rather Rejoice because your names are
[1:45:41] written in
[1:45:44] heaven in no other age can you know that
[1:45:47] you're chosen like this age
[1:45:57] you going to catch up with where I'm
[1:45:58] already
[1:46:00] at the devil's already been cast out but
[1:46:03] don't Rejoice about that Rejoice because
[1:46:06] you can't get
[1:46:16] lost
[1:46:18] Rejoice Rejoice because your names are
[1:46:22] written in heaven and in that hour Jesus
[1:46:26] rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank
[1:46:29] thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[1:46:32] that thou has hid these things from the
[1:46:34] wise and The Prudent and has revealed
[1:46:36] them unto babes even so father for so it
[1:46:39] seemed good in thy
[1:46:42] sight
[1:46:44] now we don't think that Jesus really got
[1:46:47] all As Pentecostal as all
[1:46:50] y'all well y'all know I'm about Bible
[1:46:53] man you know I'm not going to preach to
[1:46:55] you anything unless it's in the Bible
[1:46:57] ain't that right cuz I ain't got no
[1:46:59] Authority on my own word because I can
[1:47:01] tell you anything and it can fall to the
[1:47:04] ground but if I tell you something and
[1:47:05] there's an authority behind
[1:47:08] it that in the same hour Jesus
[1:47:13] Rejoice say it with me rejoice in the
[1:47:19] spirit the word properly means to Jo for
[1:47:25] Joy I just can't picture Jesus doing
[1:47:28] that I can because I see Jesus in you
[1:47:32] and I see Jesus in me
[1:47:36] well let's Rejoice just a minute let's
[1:47:45] Rejoice thank you Father you didn't give
[1:47:48] it to the Pharisees you didn't give it
[1:47:50] to the Sadducees but you reveal build it
[1:47:53] under babes that will learn if Jesus
[1:47:57] jumped for Joy how much more should you
[1:48:02] jump when you saw your name written in
[1:48:05] the Lamb's Book of Life ain't no devil
[1:48:08] take it off ain't no depression take it
[1:48:10] off ain't no anxiety take it off Diablos
[1:48:14] [Applause]
[1:48:18] himself that's the kind of message
[1:48:20] that's been given to us it's the message
[1:48:23] of

[1:48:41] when the father would take the son he
[1:48:44] would take him up there the Bible said
[1:48:46] in Galatians 4 we're in this moment

[1:49:16] Holy Ghost he's got all power that I
[1:49:19] have he's got that same power and by the
[1:49:22] word of God God I say this in the name
