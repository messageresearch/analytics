morning I may relay just a couple of quotes and a few scriptures that we did last night just to catch us all up and and uh if you heard them last night I hope you don't get too weary with that but amen I think there's I think there's incredible power in the blood of Jesus Christ and amen sometimes just the simple things get overlooked and kind of allow us to just slip through those things in Isaiah chapter 53 and verse three amen don't you love the Lord amen amen amen 53 and verse three Isaiah he is despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hit as it were our faces from him and he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen let's just pray Lord Jesus we love you this morning and we thank you for a wonderful group of people that we can speak to not only seen but also unseen Lord we all have needs and father we're going through this Humanity as we're we're walking through this this time of life brother Brandon would call it a a little hickey of Time Lord I just ask you that you would just touch us this morning strengthen us for your word and anoint us in espe way Lord each and every one of us have needs and that's what we come and no matter how much we've served the Lord we all want more of you touch us now we pray you see our needs in Jesus Christ's name we say Amen together amen amen you can be seated brother Bram said look what that day on Calvary did to you it paid your price right it settled the questions your sins be a Scarlet they're white as snow I think sometimes we just allow that to slip through our lips and don't realize how powerful that is red like crimson and white like wool then you have no sin that ought just make us right there go have Jericho March because our books were full and God rewrote the book Thank You Lord you are perfectly sinless so when your enemies want to talk about your bad old days that's not me that's not me this looks like the same house but that's not me amen no matter what what you done or what you do you're still sinless we're not Catholics here on we're not Catholics we're not having to pay for this week sins sinless Hallelujah I feel him already as long as you've accepted Jesus Christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything is forg Anything Is Forgiven is remitted and forgotten about Hallelujah I like that Amen brother Denny now did you get that then how see it through the blood the washing of the blood taken away separated of sin that the Holy Spirit Woos the believer through the blood cleansing of the Soul into the fellowship into this Spirit life inside with Christ shut out the world and the Very nature of God is in you still subject to mistakes but God can't see it amen I feel like shout because it's covered by the blood God can't see through the blood every time he looks through the blood it looks white he looks through the blood and it looks white so how powerful is The Blood let's take our camera and turn it back to that dark afternoon 1900 years ago this afternoon look at him going up on the hill and I can hear the thumping what is it it's an Old Rugged Cross going up the hillside it's dragging that Bloody Footprints of the bearer it's bumping over those rocks as it went down through the street and I look over his back and it's little specks all over that rub that robe without a seam and God of creation packing the very cross that he created there Emmanuel's blood has be to show through that through the back back and bigger and bigger and all at once they all go into one great big splash of blood and against his little humble weakly legs they begin to Splat what was it he's Dro he's drooping he's dropping his shoulder the human strength what was that God God hiding himself in Simplicity that was God packing that cross here he goes up the hill stumbling there the blood running out of him he fell Simon picked up the cross to help him with it and as he goes up on the hill the devil said you know what I know he's not God I know he's not he would never do that and I've got him now I've conquered every man and I've got him now so I know he's not God let me just say this to you before I break into this if the devil would have known how powerful this Blood was he wouldn't even scratched him he did not put one scratch on him but this blood was shed for me and you this Blood redeem mankind so he sent the bee of death to St him and ask the bee begin to hum around him you know what bees do and the six insects have stingers and the death has a stinger but you know but you know if an insect has it ever stings deep it pulls a stinger out Glory so if he ever anchored in a man an ordinary man if he's just been an ordinary man a prophet and he had stung so many prophets and he died but when he stung that one he lost his Stinger that's right he didn't have no more Stinger after that God anchored his flesh in Emmanuel and he pulled the stinger out of death oh Hallelujah in John chapter 18 and verse 36 Jesus answered to pilate my kingdom is not of this world and if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight he could have called 10,000 angels let me just say in the very silence and in being still he showed his extreme power amen he showed his extreme power by holding his power because he knew he had to die for me and for you he could have Cho he could have chose just one Angel and he would have change the whole scene then the word my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence right presented before Pilate was a spotless lamb right he was without spot or rickle right even pilate would testify of this lamb I find no fault in him now listen the enemy had to testify the enemy had to testify that he was spotless that he had no fault in him let me go a step further let me just say your enemy your enemy though he has a memory of the old book has to see that God has so cleansed the cleansed your book and has so roding it your enemy has to testify come on that you're without spot or blemish it's not what you see it's not what you feel it's not what your neighbors see or feel God looks at you as faultless God cleared your need let me just say all of us had a lot of things against us all of us had a lot of things against us but God with his blood rewrote the book this message is a bloody word right this message is more than the law of dos and don'ts this message is not a prison house right this message brings you Liberty this message brings you Grace and God called you listen if brother brandom is standing there it's the last messenger and he's standing there before the people and he says God has called you sinless are we awake if the messenger of this day stands there and says God called you sinless right come on now I want you to just think about a realm of where he's standing as a boy he's carrying water to his father's still as a boy his family is a wretched family look down on brother brandham finds himself as a woman hater as a little boy he would have been a murderer because of his own temper but God had High plans God had higher plans that he'll walk with an angel of God much of his life listen every one of us had a history but God's got higher plans go ahead and Worship the [Applause] Lord I said I said it last night let your not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also and whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas saith unto him Lord we not know know whether thou goest and how can we know the way phenomenal statement Jesus sath unto him I am the way not one of the ways there's not 50 as I said last night not 50 ways I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by me verse n and Jesus Jesus said to him have I been so long time with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip and he that has seen me has seen the father and how thou sayest then show us the father believest not believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the works which that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but that the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake verse 13 and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father May glorify the son and if you shall ask any anything in my name I will do it I want you to understand there's not a time date stamp like on your milk or on your bread or on your medicine we gave Andrew some medicine we're all doctors we're all trying to get him better and he told me he said dad this thing's been out of date for six years [Music] but the scripture doesn't have a time date stamp Glory John chapter 3 nine and Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be and Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things verely verely I say unto you we speak that we do and testify that we have seen and receive not our witness if I had told you Earthly things and you believe not how will you believe if I tell you Heavenly things and no man hath Ascend it up to heaven but he that's come down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven and I would say Nicodemus by this moment his mind is blowned you know I'm sure you experienced the same thing you're trying to tell people about the message and by the third or fourth thing their mind is just blown John chapter 3 verse 16 and everybody has it on their they can have it on their car they have it on billboards for God so loved the world right that he gave his only begotten son that that whosoever believeth in in him should not perish but have everlasting life These are next are very important for God sent his not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten of the Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and that men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil God sent Jesus into the world and they just didn't want it and because they didn't want it didn't have a desire for it did not have a predestinated seed they don't have to wait till the Judgment they're not believing already condemns it so let's come 2,000 years later God sent a prophet God sent a prophet into the world and they didn't want it they didn't want any part of it are you with me now they didn't want any part of it you don't have to wait till the Jud judement I'm sorry that's hard you don't have to wait till the judgment to figure out where you are why are we here that seed keeps you here oh brother R I'm just hanging on no you're not no you're not you're not the one hanging on you can say I quit 50 times in the but at the end of the week you're here here oh don't you love the Lord I've said I've quit a lot lot of times I quit I don't even like the preacher John 8th chapter verse 21 and then Jesus again unto them said I go my way and and you shall seek me and and die in your shall die in your sins and whether I go you cannot come and then said to the Jews will and then just said the Jews will he kill himself because he said where I go you cannot come and he said unto them I think this is so powerful and he said unto them ye are from beneath you're talking about preaching serpent seed now let me just say you better not tell your worldly friends you're from hell right that's right they're not going to understand it but you know the deal right you're from another world you can shout you're from beneath and I am from above you're this world and I am not of this world and I said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that I am he ye shall die in your sins if you don't believe I'm God you'll die in your sins Acts chapter 4 and verse 10 be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that by my name of Jesus by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth whom you crucified whom God raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole this is the stone which was set at the at at the nod of you Builders which has become the head of the corner now watch this next verse neither is there salvation in any other amen there's none other name under Heaven given unto men whereby you must be saved that's I don't think it'd be put any planer than that that was one of brother Homer's favorite scriptures right there now just hang with me he said this is brother brandom he said then God himself become a Kinsman by taking on human flesh through the Virgin birth and he shed his blood that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of God and the Bible say it says we are saved through the blood of God let me just say this to you and I'll say it again Mary's blood was toxic that's right they may worship her in Rome and there must be incredible statures of her but she was just like all Fallen men born in sin shapen in iniquity came to the world speaking lies I know we're putting scriptures together right there but brother brandom did it we'll quote him that's right she was born needing God that's right but God borrowed her womb that's right amen you're not saved by your name you're not saved by your church you're not saved by your click you can put your name on a thousand church books that doesn't save you it is the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ that's what saves you I love this quote brother randam said someday when life is over friend he's often I've often wondered what will take place when the redeemed of all ages stand around when the crown him king of kings and Lord of lords when the angels with stand stand when the Angels brother Matthew will you you get me a a tissue i w to bleed here when the Angels when they crown him king of kings and Lord of lords when the angels will stand with bowed heads when the angels will stand with bowed heads not knowing what we're talking about they don't know what it is to sin they don't know what it is to sin they never fail they don't know what it's to be to be lost they never was lost but we who has been lost and been found and redeemed and claimed back and brought into the devil's pawn shop by the glory of Jesus Christ is into by his sacrificial death I'm telling you you talk about a screaming and hollering going on it'll be a day when the redeemed Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a rat like me I once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I can see look what that day on Calvary did did to you it paid your price it settled the question you got friends still bringing up your old nonsense you got to listen just just R your shoulders back and say Hey listen the price was paid for me at Calvary it was paid for me at Calvary I'm no longer the guy amen listen I'm quoting to you a prophet of God's message I'm not quoting to you some Feelgood something it settled the question your sins as Scarlet you're white as snow red like Crimson white as wool now remember all the Glorious things that we're enjoying now sitting in Heavenly places it's just a Prelude it's a Prelude of what's coming just a an introductory of the symphony that's coming oh Hallelujah you talk about shouting and praising and glorifying and magnifying the lamp one day when the Angels stand around the earth on the Cure of the Earth with bowed heads and hear that little blood wash group singing them Redemptive songs of the blood of Jesus I'm trying to behave of the blood of Jesus Christ oh God I want to be joined with them Amen Let me take my place with her let me make my assurance Jesus is mine I'll take him and his word Angels standing on the curvature of the Earth with bowed heads now did you get that through the blood the washing of the blood the taking away the separating of sin the Holy Spirit Will loves the believer through the blood the cleansing of the blood into the fellowship into his spirit inside of Christ shut out of the world and the Very nature of God is in you the very nature of God is in you brother Ron you've already read that quote but I you didn't get it how do you know brother Ron by your reaction the very nature of God is in you right you'll still make your mistakes brother Ron but brother Brandon makes mistakes so Moses made mistakes so there was only one let's just be real clear here you hang around me long enough you'll find out I make mistakes one day I got a call and somebody was blessing me out they found a piece of sermon that they didn't like and so they called me and just unloaded they gave me a piece of mind that they really needed to keep and they unloosed and their human nature and they just they just unloaded listen I'm not an angel I didn't come to the Earth perfect I'm not perfect now there was a five gallon bucket sitting there and I started kicking that bucket and I kick the bucket and I kick the bucket and I kick the bucket the boys was was there and he said Dad are you all right and I said I'll be all right in just a few minutes somebody ought to say amen hallelujah praise the [Applause] Lord did that ever bother you brother Ronnie sure did and I was with another friend to M and and something like that happened and and there was a there was a bucket sitting there and he started kicking that bucket I said yes kick that bucket yes and kick that [Applause] bucket no I'm not going to tell you who it is good guess though I do it and we are redeemed through the blood of Christ and God Almighty is a spirit and he overshadowed the Virgin Mary and created God the Creator created the blood cell in the womb and that woman knowing no man by sexual desire you believe it and that blood cell developed into the man which was the son of God and through that unadulterated blood of the Son of God created Blood by Jehovah without sexual desire and through the shedding of the blood on calvary's Cross redeemed us it wasn't part Mary and part god get it it wasn't part Mary and part God God borred a womb and Jesus was all God listen he didn't go through life and going well you see part of Mary no it was all God he displayed [Applause] God he was a man when he cried but he's God when he raised Lazarus out of the Grave he was a man when he hungered are you with me now he said one drop of blood of Jesus Christ will raise every sinner to a saint can I say it again one drop of blood I'm talking about a powerful I'm talking about power Hallelujah I'm a bleeder let me just say I drop a lot of blood but it won't redeem nobody it won't redeem nobody but one drop of blood from our Lord Jesus Christ you're talking about power can redeem every saint every sinner to a [Applause] saint now he said when Christ the perfect s substitute was was given and his blood was shed then the life that was in Christ came back on the repentant Sinner and that life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous and then the guilty one could go free and he had no desire to sin I'm trying to behave the life of Jesus had come back upon him and the law of the spirit of the life of in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death away went that sinless nature away went that sinless guilt I I'm free I'm free I'm free at last every Born Again True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God can I say it again every Born Again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God God I want you to look at your neighbor and said God called you

has been trying to decide whether to have brother brandom to speak another sermon or not they really didn't want it but he's telling the Bride come on out come on out come on out you that has come out of the armish you couldn't do enough to satisfy the Bishops come on you couldn't do enough and you knew deep down in your heart this ain't life and then when the word grabbed you it pulled you out it

hang on to this this is paragraph 269 you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place you say where was the first place at before before the foundation right it wasn't when you two years old before the foundation of the world right God took a picture of you it wasn't when you 16 17 18 years old when you was acting ugly but God took a picture of you before the foundational world that's how he looks at you God don't even know nothing about it let me let me just let me just let me just I'm sorry let me just tell you if God knows every tick tick I'm talking about an animal here for y'all overseas if he knows every fly every mosquito every bat and every time that he bats his eyes and The Sparrows he watches over them he's telling you by a prophet of God that is bringing a church bringing a bride out of the church that has been married to a church organization and that had to die away from you now you stand as virtuous you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed I'm GNA borrow from another quote you never were a pig you may have Waller with pigs but you never was a pig you always was a son and daughter of God [Applause] if you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you are The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless of the son of God standing with a pure unadulterated Bride of the word and he Washed by the Water of his own blood that's how powerful the blood is it just didn't patch you up it just didn't fix you it transformed you you have become a new creature in Jesus Christ amen that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which was predestined into the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love Can you can I give you one more quote I'll take a little longer nap sister Connie what do you do on Sunday evening nap I've got doctor's orders to give me a nap so that's I just bless her heart I'll see her tomorrow I hope it continues you ready for this and that's the way with the real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have even a sin at all imputed to him you ought to be SLA you ought to be slapping the leg like like we was at at that preaching service now that's real preaching right there that's real I got this talking about Stonewall Jackson and they got the slap in their legs and now that's real preaching you that right brother Homer would have loved to been in on on that one did you really know that a real Christian did you know a real Christian doesn't have even any sin at all imputed to him David said blessed of the man who God will not impute sin to when you're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by make belief but really the blood of the Lamb God does not impute sin impute to you anything that's done because you're under the blood and he doesn't see it I want to ask you why do you look for it let's just be honest then why do you look for it why you dig around in the bones God doesn't see it this is under the seventh seal under the third pull he's telling you I don't look at your sins I don't look at your mistake listen this is foundation preaching right here I prach I preached it for near 40 years now why should I change [Applause] there's a blood sacrifice and the only thing that he can see you in is the way that he saw you before the foundation of the world Lord help me behave when he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that's all that he can look at because you were redeemed and from everything that that was ever done you're Washed by the blood of the Lamb therefore there's no G in you there's no inclean habit in you because the blood of the Lamb has did this and God cannot impute sin to you after you've all got sin offering laying there waiting for you okay I need an example brother Ry okay my mentor I saw him do it in a lot of conventions he said this one page separates you from your old life in the Old Testament Abraham laughed at God he rolled around on the and laughed at God he lied but in Romans chapter 4L it said there was nothing imputed unto Abraham and he staggered not at the promises of God
