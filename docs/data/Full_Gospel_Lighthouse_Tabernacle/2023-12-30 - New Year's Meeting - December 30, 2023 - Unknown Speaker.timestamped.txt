[39:07] verse aren't you so thankful to be
[39:10] serving a God that doesn't
[39:12] change this word that was pinned 2,000
[39:15] years ago is just as real and just as
[39:17] alive and just as effective as the day
[39:19] it was written as a day it was spoken
[39:22] off the precious lips of our savior is
[39:24] still just as true amen let's begin
[39:27] reading verse one and he spake a parable
[39:30] unto them to this
[39:32] end that men ought always to pray and
[39:35] not to faint saying there was in a city
[39:38] a judge which feared not God neither
[39:41] regarded man and there was a widow in
[39:44] that City and she came unto him saying
[39:46] avenge me of mine adversary and he would
[39:49] not for a while but afterward he said
[39:51] within himself though I fear not God nor
[39:53] regard man yet because this Widow
[39:57] troubleth me I will avenge her lest by
[39:59] her continual coming she weary me and
[40:02] the Lord said hear what the unjust judge
[40:05] saith and shall not God avenge his own
[40:09] elect which cried day and night unto him
[40:13] though he bear long with them I tell you
[40:16] that he shall avenge them speedily
[40:19] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[40:22] shall he find faith on the earth let's
[40:26] speak to him just now dear gracious
[40:28] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus any person
[40:30] father Lord any abled-bodied person Lord
[40:32] can turn the pages of this scripture but
[40:34] father God it takes your Holy Spirit
[40:36] Lord to get behind the words and to
[40:38] speak the words of eternal life to our
[40:40] souls Lord You've gathered us here
[40:42] together Lord not of our own selves
[40:44] father Lord or not for human or carnal
[40:46] reasonings but Lord for Divine Purpose
[40:48] we just pray oh God that you forgive us
[40:50] of all of our sins and mistakes Lord and
[40:52] as we look into your word may you just
[40:55] help me Father Lord to take the thought
[40:56] Lord that you've laid Upon My Heart Lord
[40:58] and help me to get out of the way that
[41:00] your spirit can get behind the voice
[41:02] father Lord of a feeble man Lord may you
[41:05] be the voice behind The Voice May it
[41:07] Quicken Faith to your people Lord we
[41:09] love you with all of our heart we commit
[41:11] this service into your hands in Jesus
[41:13] Christ's name amen amen God bless you as
[41:15] you're
[41:16] seated with the help of the Lord I'd
[41:18] like to speak on just for a few moments
[41:20] here I like to title it shall I find
[41:23] faith in verse eight again I like to
[41:25] read I tell you that he will avenge them
[41:28] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[41:31] man cometh shall he find faith on the
[41:35] earth scoffield if you have a scoffield
[41:38] Bible you'll find it there in the
[41:39] footnotes but he makes a very
[41:41] interesting and a
[41:43] profound statement on what this verse
[41:46] means here the word faith this isn't a
[41:48] lot of times when you hear do you have
[41:49] faith to be healed or I have faith that
[41:52] this will happen or you know I believe
[41:54] God's going to do this and that is faith
[41:56] and we know that faith will bring God's
[41:59] word and God's promise to pass in your
[42:00] life yet here what Jesus is speaking of
[42:03] is not exactly he's not asking the
[42:06] question when I come back to the Earth
[42:08] will I find the faith that people can
[42:10] believe me for healing or maybe they can
[42:13] believe me for something that they want
[42:14] me to do in their life the scofi
[42:17] mentions here the reference is not
[42:19] personal faith but to believe in the
[42:23] whole body of the revealed truth
[42:27] now that changes what Jesus is saying
[42:30] here he's asking the question that when
[42:32] the son of man comes back after 2,000
[42:35] years of being the office of the Holy
[42:38] Spirit when I come back to earth to
[42:41] receive my bride when I come back to the
[42:43] Earth in as son of man again will I find
[42:47] faith on the
[42:49] earth will I find the faith of the son
[42:53] of man on the earth and we know that
[42:55] faith faith is a revelation real genuine
[42:59] faith is not hope real genuine faith is
[43:02] a revelation I heard the prophet say the
[43:04] other day he obviously was wearing a
[43:05] white shirt but he said if God can if
[43:08] you can believe God about something
[43:11] you're trusting in for as much as you're
[43:12] convinced I'll use my shirt as an
[43:14] example that I've got a green shirt on
[43:17] there's nothing to keep you from getting
[43:19] what you're asking God for if you can be
[43:21] so convinced about the God's word as you
[43:25] are that I am actually wearing a green
[43:28] shirt does anyone in this church doubt
[43:31] that I'm wearing a green shirt you're
[43:34] convinced so why can't we have the same
[43:37] convincing about the word of God the
[43:39] faith when I come back will I have that
[43:43] faith will I find that kind of faith in
[43:45] on the earth not just a faith for
[43:48] healing because the the nominal
[43:50] Christians have that they understand
[43:52] that God heals they understand that God
[43:55] Saves but will God find real genuine
[44:00] unadulterated faith in the word of the
[44:03] hour when he comes back with so many
[44:05] people falling away with so many people
[44:07] leaving the message will there be a
[44:09] people on the Earth that refuse to give
[44:13] up that have a faith not just for
[44:16] healing but an unshakable Faith the
[44:19] Revelation in his word that the message
[44:21] of the hour is just as effective now as
[44:24] it was the day it was spoken
[44:27] that's the kind of faith God is looking
[44:29] for that's the kind of faith that God
[44:31] brings God on the scene in Hebrews 11
[44:34] the Bible tells us now Faith is the
[44:37] substance of things hoped for the
[44:39] evidence of Things Not Seen for by it
[44:42] the elders obtained obtained a good
[44:44] report through faith we understand that
[44:46] the worlds were framed by the word of
[44:47] God so that the things which are seen
[44:50] were not made of things which do
[44:53] appear now watch this by Faith by
[44:58] Revelation Abel offered unto God a more
[45:01] excellent sacrifice than
[45:04] Cain by which by his sacrifice he
[45:08] obtained witness that he was righteous
[45:11] and God testifying of his
[45:14] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[45:17] speaketh now there's a lot in that
[45:20] verse because Faith because Abel had the
[45:23] Revelation to know what to present to
[45:25] God that's right and that justified Abel
[45:30] and God actually testified that that was
[45:33] right whenever he came down and he
[45:36] consumed Abel's sacrifice but left Cain
[45:39] sitting there God Justified that I
[45:41] accept Abel but refused Cain's
[45:45] sacrifice and despite even though Cain
[45:47] killed Abel Abel's sacrifice still
[45:50] speaks how did his sacrifice still speak
[45:53] because of what he did
[45:57] spoke to what God had in his mind
[46:00] because see it's when our minds and our
[46:02] hearts it's when our minds and our
[46:04] thoughts and hearts and Revelation all
[46:06] align with God's
[46:08] mind that's when something's going to
[46:10] take place that's when you can have your
[46:13] haty right moment because of your desire
[46:16] and you align yourself with God's
[46:20] thought on a
[46:21] matter a negative testimony is not God's
[46:24] thought on the matter speaking the word
[46:27] in faith is God's thought on the matter
[46:29] repeating what God Said how did how did
[46:31] the prophet say that in the church age
[46:33] book when a born again Christian gets
[46:35] the word of mouth and gets the word of
[46:37] God and speaks it from their lips in
[46:39] faith it's the same as deity speaking
[46:42] why because when you speak his word it's
[46:45] not your word it's his word so you're
[46:47] then getting his word and you're putting
[46:49] it in your lips on your heart first it
[46:53] goes from the mind to the heart and out
[46:55] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[46:58] speaketh so it goes from mind to heart
[47:01] out and when you speak in faith despite
[47:04] your circumstances you then align
[47:07] yourself to what God thinks on the
[47:09] matter because God's thought is already
[47:12] recorded on the word so then God says
[47:15] Amen to what you
[47:17] say because you're repeating the word of
[47:21] God that whenever we align ourselves as
[47:23] I said that is when mountains to move
[47:26] that is when blessings are poured out
[47:28] that is when deity is
[47:30] displayed because you align yourself
[47:33] with the mind of God and that is what
[47:35] Abel did he what God already had the
[47:38] lamb slain in his mind before the
[47:41] foundation of the world and When sin
[47:44] entered in and time entered in here Abel
[47:46] presents a sacrifice that is exactly
[47:49] what God was
[47:51] thinking so God came down it pleased God
[47:57] what did Jesus
[47:59] say he said for I do always those things
[48:03] that pleased him he was always walking
[48:07] in the will of the father he said the
[48:09] father shows me and I work hither
[48:12] to so whenever he walked and God showed
[48:15] him to leave Lazarus was going to die
[48:16] and he had to leave and you know the
[48:18] story and all the different footsteps of
[48:19] everything he did was with a
[48:23] purpose and everything he did
[48:26] aligned with the
[48:28] word that is why everything he said came
[48:31] to
[48:33] pass Abel displayed on Earth exactly
[48:37] what God had in his mind in heaven oh
[48:40] yeah that is real
[48:43] Faith he no doubt was taught by his
[48:45] parents because remember when Adam and
[48:48] Eve fell God came and they killed God
[48:50] had to kill an innocent lamb and clothe
[48:52] Adam and Eve and Adam began to teach
[48:55] teach his
[48:56] son this is we left the Garden of Eden
[49:00] this is why we had to leave and out of
[49:03] all of
[49:06] creation he chose a
[49:09] lamb he didn't choose to cover them in a
[49:12] in a Wolf
[49:14] clothing God didn't choose to cover them
[49:17] up in the clothing of a
[49:19] badger he chose a
[49:22] lamb why because the characteristic of a
[49:25] lamb is one of the most innocent things
[49:27] in
[49:29] creation and Adam begins to tell Abel
[49:32] these things and Abel is
[49:34] teachable unlike Cain that's right Abel
[49:38] begins to retain these things that Adam
[49:40] tells
[49:41] him and he then puts it into
[49:46] practice the prophet of God said Here
[49:49] Comes able knowing that it wasn't apples
[49:51] or fruits God didn't dwell in beauty or
[49:53] sincerity he dwells in election and
[49:57] calling so he wraps this Vine around the
[50:00] Lamb's neck and here he comes moving up
[50:04] to the
[50:05] altar I suppose his
[50:07] altar was a big rock and he takes this
[50:11] little fellow and throws them back on
[50:12] this rock like this takes a
[50:14] rock cuz I guess they didn't have any
[50:16] lances or knives in them days and there
[50:18] was Cain up there just a glorifying God
[50:20] in his Beauty Lord What I've Done Lord
[50:23] look here you know my heart you know I'm
[50:25] sincere I'm giving you all the praise
[50:27] I'm doing this I'm doing that all what
[50:29] he's doing and little old Abel Abel took
[50:32] that
[50:33] lamb threw it back like that got a rock
[50:35] in his hand and begin to chop its little
[50:38] throat I see Abel's hands become
[50:43] bloody I see the white wool hanging
[50:46] around that little lamb bloody God
[50:48] looked down and he said that's it you've
[50:51] got
[50:52] it Abel was prophesying
[50:56] that's right by his
[51:00] sacrifice God looked down and he seen
[51:05] himself right
[51:07] there it's no wonder he came down to
[51:10] consume the sacrifice it pleased
[51:13] him what does fruit have to do with
[51:16] Redemption what does Beauty have to do
[51:18] with Redemption hundreds of years later
[51:20] Isaiah comes and said there's no beauty
[51:23] that we should desire them right Beauty
[51:26] has nothing to do with
[51:28] it but it's the character the life that
[51:31] has the ability to
[51:34] redeem that has everything to do with it
[51:38] but God looked down and he said that's
[51:40] it you've got it what did it speak of
[51:45] the Lamb of God that was slain from the
[51:47] foundation of the world was led with a
[51:50] rope around his neck of gol goa's Hill
[51:52] Yonder Hallelujah they laid him down
[51:54] they beat his body into into stripes for
[51:58] the healing they nailed in his hands and
[52:01] he stuck there between the heavens and
[52:02] the Earth on the Rock of
[52:04] Ages crying out with an unknown tongue
[52:07] speaking Eli
[52:09] Eli that lamb was speaking in an unknown
[52:13] tongue to who the
[52:17] sacrificer it was sitting there before
[52:19] Abel and Abel didn't know what that L
[52:22] was doing it was blading out BL in out
[52:25] and the people that was killing this
[52:29] lamb the Jews that hung him to the cross
[52:32] the unbelievers didn't know what he was
[52:34] saying he was speaking out to the father
[52:37] Eli Eli that was Abel's Lamb slain from
[52:40] the foundation of the world his bloody
[52:43] locks hanging around
[52:46] him what was Calvary it was another can
[52:50] and Abel
[52:53] moment because after Abel sacrifice was
[52:56] accepted Abel no doubt began to expound
[52:59] to Cain because remember Adam and Eve
[53:02] sin God clothed
[53:04] them then Abel and Cain grew up together
[53:07] and became of
[53:09] age then this what what I what we're
[53:12] talking about here this event happened
[53:14] they both presented their sacrifices of
[53:18] worship then God tells Cain hey do do
[53:20] like your brother and you'll be
[53:22] accepted so there was a process of time
[53:24] and a begins to to to no doubt maybe
[53:28] preach God's chosen place of worship to
[53:31] Cain maybe he began to preach Jezebel
[53:34] religion to
[53:36] Cain and one day it made him so
[53:40] angry he maybe picked up a rock or a
[53:43] club laying on the ground and killed his
[53:48] brother the more able spoke the more
[53:52] angry king got because whenever you
[53:54] preach the word word word the the word
[53:56] is light and it scatters
[53:59] darkness and people's reaction to the
[54:02] word tells you where they're at so
[54:05] whenever the word just like if the word
[54:07] calls you an eagle it tells you who you
[54:09] are if it calls you a chicken it tells
[54:10] you who you are it's the same
[54:13] word so the word was calling Abel a Son
[54:16] of God but the word was the same word
[54:19] was calling Cain the son of the
[54:22] devil and as Abel be to preach can it be
[54:26] to really get him
[54:27] going and it made him so angry he killed
[54:34] him when Jesus was on the earth the
[54:37] greater Abel the greater Adam the
[54:41] greater
[54:43] Seth the more he spoke and the more he
[54:46] preached the more it angered the phes
[54:50] and the
[54:52] Sadducees he was they were already angry
[54:54] when he healed on the Sabbath but wait
[54:56] until the precious words of I and my
[54:58] father are
[55:00] one it brings such Clarity to us but it
[55:03] angered
[55:05] them they then begin to try and think
[55:08] how can we get rid of
[55:11] Jesus see the Pharisees and the
[55:14] Sadducees they maybe were direct
[55:15] descendants of Abraham right and maybe
[55:18] they could prove it and Jesus didn't
[55:20] even deny it but you find in St John
[55:22] 8:44 Jesus finally lays it down to who
[55:25] they really are he said ye are of your
[55:28] father the
[55:30] devil isn't that what Cain
[55:33] was and the lust of your father you will
[55:36] do he was a murderer from the beginning
[55:38] and Abode not in the truth because
[55:40] there's no truth in him until when he
[55:42] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[55:45] for he is a liar and the father of
[55:49] it and it angered them and it angered
[55:52] them and it angered them and they got to
[55:54] a spot with until the day they rose up
[55:57] and they killed
[55:59] Jesus that's what that's what I believe
[56:02] it was Steven there in Acts two ye have
[56:04] taken and by Wicked hands have crucified
[56:07] and
[56:09] slain brother Ram continues there's
[56:11] God's provided sacrifice there's the
[56:14] faith that was once delivered to the
[56:15] Saints hanging bleeding blading dying
[56:18] like Abel's
[56:20] lamb that's the faith he wants to find
[56:22] on earth when he comes back the faith of
[56:25] the fathers earnestly contending for the
[56:27] faith that was once delivered to the
[56:30] Saints that's why God had to sent a
[56:32] prophet to restore back the
[56:36] faith to restore back the faith that
[56:39] Jesus is going to come looking
[56:43] for Abel's L was
[56:47] accepted in Mount
[56:49] Mariah Abraham's sacrifice was
[56:52] accepted on Mount Carmel El El's
[56:55] sacrifice was
[56:57] accepted Mount
[56:59] Calvary the perfect sacrifice was
[57:04] accepted and if you put yourself on the
[57:06] altar
[57:08] tonight not with Works Lord look what
[57:12] I've done you remember in the scripture
[57:14] Whenever there was a Pharisee that
[57:16] prayed Jesus tells the story and he said
[57:17] Lord I'm so glad and the FY I believe it
[57:19] was he was praying and he was saying
[57:21] Lord I'm so glad I'm not like other
[57:22] people I'm so glad I'm not like this
[57:24] Publican over here I'm so glad i'
[57:26] haven't done this I'm so glad I haven't
[57:27] done that I'm so glad I haven't done
[57:29] that and there was a sinner a Publican
[57:32] who was so
[57:33] broken he said he wouldn't even look up
[57:35] to heaven he was so ashamed of himself
[57:37] and he said God have mercy on me a
[57:39] sinner Jesus asked the question he said
[57:41] who left
[57:43] Justified the the religious Pharisee or
[57:45] the Publican that was broken God would
[57:48] have consumed his
[57:49] sacrifice so whenever we're broken and
[57:52] we empty out and say Lord there's
[57:53] nothing I've got that I can give give
[57:54] you but myself you lay yourself with
[57:58] that kind of attitude on the Altar and I
[58:00] promise you your sacrifice will be
[58:03] consumed with the fire of the Holy
[58:06] Ghost because full obedience to the word
[58:09] entitles you to what the
[58:13] token now God's faith is not a
[58:16] wishy-washy hop so Faith God's faith is
[58:18] an overcoming
[58:19] Faith now overcoming is not necessarily
[58:22] when we shout when we rejoice and enjoy
[58:24] Supernatural experiences those things
[58:26] are either in Victory or God is
[58:28] preparing you for
[58:30] something overcoming is when you're by
[58:35] yourself true overcoming is when you're
[58:38] by yourself true overcoming is when you
[58:42] maybe know or or you know where you're
[58:44] in a position where no one would ever
[58:45] know if I do
[58:47] this but yet you are a Christian in that
[58:51] moment that is where you overcome
[58:55] that is true overcoming but why are we
[58:57] why do we Rejoice at the word because it
[59:00] strengthens us for those
[59:03] moments why do we dance in the spirit
[59:05] why do we shout because it strengthens
[59:08] us we shout and we dance in
[59:12] Victory because there's people that
[59:14] dance and shout and speak in tongues and
[59:16] do everything in church but can't
[59:17] overcome worth a hoot out there so
[59:20] what's the difference you see but when
[59:22] you've got something in you to overcome
[59:24] with it's his faith that will overcome
[59:27] the world because greater is he that is
[59:30] in you than he that is in the
[59:33] world praise be to
[59:37] God we have more than it takes to
[59:40] overcome now think of this in the
[59:42] scripture when John the Baptist when
[59:44] Jesus appeared at John the Baptist on
[59:46] the on the Jordan River I heard brother
[59:49] Bram do a beautiful dramatization the
[59:51] other day never heard it quite like this
[59:53] before but he said that Lazarus told
[59:56] Jesus about John the Baptist because
[59:59] they were childhood
[1:00:00] friends and he said he took him
[1:00:03] down and when John the Baptist seen
[1:00:06] Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:00:09] that takes away the sin of the world he
[1:00:11] said that Lazarus fainted at Jesus's
[1:00:14] feet here was his childhood friend and
[1:00:17] he's the
[1:00:19] Messiah but you see John the Baptist
[1:00:22] introduced the Messiah
[1:00:25] in front of multitudes of people no
[1:00:28] doubt but what look in the scripture he
[1:00:31] Vindicated him and he announced him to
[1:00:33] the world but when Jesus then led by the
[1:00:36] Holy Ghost went up into the mountain to
[1:00:37] be tempted for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:00:40] there were multitudes with him no he was
[1:00:44] by
[1:00:46] himself but he had what he needed to
[1:00:49] overcome the spirit of God descended on
[1:00:52] him like a dove he was God and
[1:00:56] flesh he healed multitudes and he
[1:00:58] preached in front of
[1:01:00] multitudes but when it came down to the
[1:01:02] Garden of Gethsemane where he had to die
[1:01:04] to
[1:01:05] himself he had to overcome
[1:01:07] himself he was
[1:01:11] alone that is where the character of
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ is made
[1:01:15] alone you and
[1:01:18] him we all share testimonies but we all
[1:01:20] have our own
[1:01:22] testimony we're all collectively
[1:01:24] baptized in the body of Christ but we
[1:01:26] get in there
[1:01:29] individually now overcoming a lot of
[1:01:31] times is just in the
[1:01:34] mundane everyday
[1:01:37] tasks you're just going to your job
[1:01:39] you're going to your you're going
[1:01:40] through your life you're going through
[1:01:42] things you're being a light to the world
[1:01:43] but you're overcoming each and every
[1:01:48] day
[1:01:50] overcoming is standing toe-to-toe with
[1:01:52] the devil and refusing to back up
[1:01:56] up refusing to back up that's the kind
[1:02:00] of Faith Jesus had and that's the kind
[1:02:02] of Faith Miss Jesus
[1:02:04] has overcoming is believing and loving
[1:02:07] God despite the
[1:02:09] circumstances and the lack of our
[1:02:11] answers we're humans we love having
[1:02:13] answers to things well God will get us a
[1:02:16] lot of times in a place where we simply
[1:02:18] don't have the
[1:02:20] answer but you got to believe them there
[1:02:23] sarapan
[1:02:25] woman in the scripture let's read that
[1:02:26] Matthew 15 and behold a woman of Canaan
[1:02:29] came out of the same coast and Cried
[1:02:30] unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord
[1:02:33] thou son of David my daughter is
[1:02:34] grievously vexed with the devil but he
[1:02:37] answered her not a word could you
[1:02:41] imagine Jesus standing here and you have
[1:02:44] a need like
[1:02:45] this and you going up to him and saying
[1:02:47] Jesus I I I I need
[1:02:50] you my child is sick or my husband or my
[1:02:53] wife is sick could you would you please
[1:02:55] come would you please heal
[1:02:58] him he don't even look at
[1:03:01] you and you're standing here and he's
[1:03:04] standing
[1:03:05] here this ain't the preacher this is God
[1:03:08] himself and you're asking him to do
[1:03:11] something for you that you really really
[1:03:13] need him to
[1:03:15] do but he won't even look at
[1:03:18] you in fact maybe he just turned this
[1:03:23] way
[1:03:25] but
[1:03:26] she refused to back
[1:03:29] up she was made of the stuff that
[1:03:31] wouldn't
[1:03:32] Bluff the Bible says and he answered her
[1:03:35] not a word and his disciples came and
[1:03:37] beside him saying send her away cuz she
[1:03:39] crith for us she kept going on and on
[1:03:42] and
[1:03:43] on and then not only did he ignore her
[1:03:45] but when he finally turned to her and
[1:03:47] decided to say something to her he said
[1:03:50] something like this
[1:03:52] yeah I am not sin
[1:03:55] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[1:04:00] Israel then she came and worshiped him
[1:04:02] saying Lord help me see how perseverant
[1:04:05] she
[1:04:05] was and then he
[1:04:08] further tells her this it's not meat to
[1:04:12] take the children's bread and to cast it
[1:04:14] to the
[1:04:16] dogs he ignored her for a long time he
[1:04:20] nagged she nagged so much the disciples
[1:04:22] like please get this woman away from
[1:04:25] here he ignored her wouldn't talk to
[1:04:29] her and when he finally gave her a
[1:04:32] moment of his time he called her a
[1:04:35] dog Jesus called her a
[1:04:39] dog why because he knew what she was
[1:04:42] made
[1:04:43] of he wouldn't have just tested her if
[1:04:46] that would have sent her away because he
[1:04:47] knew she was
[1:04:50] elect and what did she say she didn't
[1:04:54] stomp at a
[1:04:56] church she said truth Lord come on she
[1:05:00] agreed with the word truth you're right
[1:05:04] I'm a dog I don't deserve
[1:05:09] you but if I could just have a
[1:05:13] crumb if you you know if you could just
[1:05:16] slip me some crumbs off of the
[1:05:18] table that'll be enough for
[1:05:21] me you're so mighty and you're so
[1:05:24] wonderful and you can just cast Satan
[1:05:26] with a flick of your finger but just
[1:05:28] give me some
[1:05:30] crumbs if I could get some crumbs off
[1:05:33] the master's table that's all I need but
[1:05:35] listen he hasn't called you for crumbs
[1:05:38] he's called you to the wedding
[1:05:40] supper he's called you to the wedding
[1:05:42] serer of the Lamb he's got your name
[1:05:45] written down he's got your
[1:05:48] reservation a table spread 1,000 miles
[1:05:51] long he hasn't called his bride to drums
[1:05:54] he's called you to a seven course
[1:05:58] Mill pull up and
[1:06:00] eat it's all for
[1:06:03] you he died to make this
[1:06:06] possible glory to
[1:06:08] God oh she wanted was
[1:06:12] crumbs oh Church what people ought we to
[1:06:17] [Applause]
[1:06:19] be he knows he looks down and no doubt
[1:06:23] the Holy Spirit right now if you only
[1:06:26] realized what a preferred lady you were
[1:06:29] you
[1:06:32] are you're
[1:06:34] preferred you're like
[1:06:37] Esther you've got a special place in his
[1:06:42] kingdom she refused to back
[1:06:45] up but he said one word to the disciples
[1:06:48] in St John chapter 6 except you eat the
[1:06:51] Flesh of the son of man drink his blood
[1:06:53] you've got no part with me me and they
[1:06:55] said this is a hard saying I can't I
[1:06:57] can't take this and they
[1:06:58] left and there's still a few more too
[1:07:00] many hanging around like with Gideon and
[1:07:02] he said what will you do if you see the
[1:07:04] son of man ascending from whence he
[1:07:07] came and in St John 6 chap in St John
[1:07:11] chapter 6 verse 66
[1:07:15] 666 the scripture tells us that from
[1:07:17] that time many of his disciples went
[1:07:20] back and walked no more with him
[1:07:25] then Jesus said unto the 12 will you
[1:07:26] also go
[1:07:28] away but do you see the difference in
[1:07:30] what was in Peter and what was in the
[1:07:32] other disciples he said Lord to whom
[1:07:36] shall we go that's right thou Hast the
[1:07:40] words of eternal
[1:07:43] life the same spiritual strain that was
[1:07:46] in the sarapan woman was in
[1:07:51] Peter they're from the same family
[1:07:55] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:07:58] shall he find faith on the earth brother
[1:08:02] Bram said in the sermon be certain of
[1:08:04] God we're nearing the coming of the Lord
[1:08:07] God's coming for a
[1:08:10] church he never asked in question will I
[1:08:12] have a church will I have righteousness
[1:08:14] but here was the question Jesus asked
[1:08:16] will I find faith when I
[1:08:19] come God putting you to a test maybe to
[1:08:22] try your faith
[1:08:25] we're now looking at 2024 right in the
[1:08:28] face we're that much closer to the
[1:08:31] coming of the
[1:08:33] Lord the message is still thus sayith
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:38] Lord the bride is still marching forward
[1:08:41] in the perfect will of
[1:08:42] God we're dressed in his
[1:08:45] word and we're waiting for the boss's
[1:08:48] son to come get
[1:08:51] us we're dressed we're on the edge of
[1:08:54] the road and there's people laughing at
[1:08:57] you good people
[1:08:59] maybe but you
[1:09:02] know you've got a promise hanging over
[1:09:06] you and you're standing on the edge of
[1:09:08] the road with anticipation on your
[1:09:12] face and you're dressing that beautiful
[1:09:14] wedding
[1:09:15] gown and you can we're living so close
[1:09:18] we can hear the wheels
[1:09:22] coming we've been told
[1:09:24] he's coming back we see what's going on
[1:09:27] in Israel we see the world events that
[1:09:30] what is that that is the noise of the
[1:09:31] wheels coming to get you because before
[1:09:34] they can have their time and before the
[1:09:36] bombs can fall like they will fall
[1:09:38] you've got to get out of the
[1:09:40] way so that is the wheels coming down
[1:09:43] the more trouble we hear the more wars
[1:09:45] and rumors of wars and all these
[1:09:47] troubles of the world the more the
[1:09:49] louder and the closer the wheels
[1:09:51] get now's not the time to run back in
[1:09:53] the
[1:09:54] house now's not the time to say I hear
[1:09:57] the wills come but I've got enough time
[1:09:58] to go dip in the world I've got enough
[1:10:00] time to go do this you don't have time
[1:10:02] you stand in your spot and you wait
[1:10:05] because he's coming on he's on the way
[1:10:08] you don't want to miss it don't run back
[1:10:10] in the house don't don't worry about
[1:10:13] it you commit unto God you don't worry
[1:10:17] about it one man a g one day a man want
[1:10:19] and I'm closing one day a man wanted to
[1:10:22] follow Jesus and he said Lord let me
[1:10:25] first go back to my house and tell my
[1:10:28] family goodbye let me go do this that or
[1:10:30] the other and Jesus said he that puts
[1:10:32] his hand on the plow and looks back
[1:10:33] ain't worthy of
[1:10:35] me you're by the road don't
[1:10:42] leave when God when Jesus went away the
[1:10:45] musicians can
[1:10:46] come when Jesus was on the earth he said
[1:10:49] I go and prepare a place for
[1:10:51] you and I'll come back and receive CE
[1:10:53] you to myself that where I am there ye
[1:10:56] may be
[1:10:58] also in the church age book brother R
[1:11:00] said he quotes Revelations 3:22 he says
[1:11:02] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[1:11:05] the spirit saith unto the churches he
[1:11:07] said this is the last warning they will
[1:11:09] not be another the throne room has been
[1:11:11] set up the 12 foundations have been laid
[1:11:14] the streets of gold have been paved the
[1:11:16] gates of gigantic pearls are raised and
[1:11:18] hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair
[1:11:21] and glorious the heaven beings who have
[1:11:24] prepared her watch
[1:11:27] breathlessly it's already
[1:11:29] ready it's already it's all right now
[1:11:32] just
[1:11:33] empty waiting for
[1:11:37] you for she glistens and shines with a
[1:11:39] glory that is unearthly every facet of
[1:11:42] her beauty tells a story of Amazing
[1:11:45] Grace in Jesus's
[1:11:48] love as we walk through that City we're
[1:11:50] going to come across certain details no
[1:11:52] doubt because of this right here and
[1:11:54] it's going to remind us of things that
[1:11:56] he
[1:11:59] did of his grace on our lives she is a
[1:12:03] city prepared for a prepared people she
[1:12:05] awaits only for her inhabitants and soon
[1:12:10] they will throng her streets with
[1:12:13] joy nevertheless when the son of man
[1:12:16] cometh shall he find faith on the
[1:12:20] earth I would say yes yes Lord
[1:12:24] I would say yes because he also said
[1:12:25] there was going to be a bride without
[1:12:27] spot and without
[1:12:30] wrinkle the faith that Abel had sister
[1:12:33] Whitney you have the faith that Enoch
[1:12:36] had you
[1:12:39] have the faith that Jesus had you have
[1:12:44] amen that's right that's the kind of
[1:12:46] Faith why because God in his
[1:12:50] Mercy saved a seventh star
[1:12:54] to the very last
[1:12:56] agage and he sent the star when he
[1:12:58] released it out of his
[1:13:00] hand and because you listened to a
[1:13:03] humble
[1:13:04] man who had his own struggles had his
[1:13:07] own ways but yet you could look past
[1:13:10] that and you could hear the voice of God
[1:13:12] speaking through him you humbled
[1:13:15] yourself to that and that changed you
[1:13:17] and now that has actually restored your
[1:13:19] heart back to that same faith that they
[1:13:22] had on the day of Pentecost same Holy
[1:13:25] Ghost same acts same Works God bless you
[1:13:29] Saints love you with all of our heart

[1:27:42] here amen I'll let you have your seats
[1:27:45] in just a
[1:27:46] moment faith in God's
[1:27:48] word I'm going to take it a desire to go
[1:27:52] beyond your own
[1:27:54] abilities amen we have to have that we
[1:27:58] can't do it on our
[1:28:00] own when they asked me to preach the
[1:28:02] other day on this worldwide web thing
[1:28:06] that he's got going on they see
[1:28:08] everything out there you don't believe
[1:28:10] me watch it
[1:28:12] sometime and he asked me I instantly
[1:28:15] went into a fetal
[1:28:21] position
[1:28:22] because there's many people preached
[1:28:25] here I I think about all the message
[1:28:28] that's been preached here all the great
[1:28:32] you know when you coming in my wife is
[1:28:34] over there and she's like just be
[1:28:36] yourself so y'all be
[1:28:39] careful amen we're looking into the
[1:28:42] scriptures this
[1:28:43] evening and I don't mean to preach on
[1:28:45] you but it's just what the Lord laid on
[1:28:47] my heart and so we want to look at it
[1:28:51] Exodus four and verse
[1:29:00] six amen I got to keep up with the time
[1:29:02] I got to do as much as I can in 20
[1:29:05] minutes
[1:29:07] amen and the Lord said furthermore unto
[1:29:10] him this is God speaking to Moses put
[1:29:14] forth thine hand into my bosom and he
[1:29:16] put his hand into his bosom and when he
[1:29:19] took it out behold his hand was leprosy
[1:29:22] as
[1:29:23] snow and he said put thine hand into my
[1:29:25] bosom again and he put his hand into his
[1:29:29] bosom again and plucked it out of his
[1:29:31] bosom and behold it was turned again as
[1:29:35] his other
[1:29:37] flesh and shall it come to pass if they
[1:29:40] will not believe thee neither hearken
[1:29:43] unto thy voice of the first sign that
[1:29:46] they will believe the voice of the
[1:29:48] latter sign and it shall come to pass if
[1:29:52] they will not believe also these two
[1:29:55] signs neither hearken to thy voice that
[1:29:57] thou shalt take of the water of the
[1:29:59] river and poured on the dry land and the
[1:30:02] water that thou takest out of the river
[1:30:04] shall become blood upon the land and
[1:30:08] Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I am
[1:30:13] not
[1:30:14] eloquent neither hither to hither four
[1:30:18] nor since thou Hast spoken unto thy
[1:30:22] servant but I am slow of speech and slow
[1:30:26] of tongue and the Lord said unto him who
[1:30:29] hath made man's mouth or who maketh the
[1:30:33] dumb or the death or the sin or the
[1:30:36] blind have not I the Lord may the Lord
[1:30:40] add His blessings to his word am man you
[1:30:44] may be seated this evening we see it we
[1:30:46] see we're coming to we're coming to a
[1:30:48] point when we looking at Moses standing
[1:30:52] here he's been to the burning bush he's
[1:30:55] tried it within himself to be the
[1:30:57] deliverer he had heard all the stories
[1:30:59] you've heard the message you're going to
[1:31:00] be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[1:31:02] you know you're hearing these messages
[1:31:03] and what I want to do is take and stir
[1:31:05] the faith that was in you to realize
[1:31:08] that this is just not words that's
[1:31:10] laying here and your desire his desire
[1:31:13] Moses was to to deliver the the
[1:31:16] Israelites and delivered them out of
[1:31:18] that bondage that they were in because
[1:31:19] he seen them as mud dobers and we see
[1:31:21] what was going going on but what
[1:31:22] happened when God actually came to him
[1:31:24] and spoke to him you know when Ronald
[1:31:26] asked me I went into that fetal position
[1:31:28] within my mind because in my flesh side
[1:31:30] I don't want to fail the bride I don't
[1:31:32] want to say a word that would be
[1:31:34] incorrect and you know when you're when
[1:31:36] you're up here you're getting into the
[1:31:37] emotions and you feel it and it's a
[1:31:39] pulling and a drawing but what we want
[1:31:41] to do is get beyond what this man can do
[1:31:43] we want to get step into a realm that's
[1:31:45] more than what what man can give you we
[1:31:47] looking into a realm that desire is to
[1:31:50] be more like Jesus Christ and to become
[1:31:52] more like him you had to surrender
[1:31:54] yourself over to him amen as we we'll
[1:31:56] proceed on we'll see Jesus had to
[1:31:58] surrender himself but here's Moses he's
[1:32:00] having to surrender over God said I'll
[1:32:02] be with you I'll be in you until the end
[1:32:04] of the world and me he's telling Moses
[1:32:06] I'll be with you I will grant whatever
[1:32:08] you ask I'm going to give it to you and
[1:32:10] we look at him he's he's still in that
[1:32:12] fetal I cannot I don't know if I can do
[1:32:14] it I don't know many times we said here
[1:32:16] let's look at it in the reality side you

[1:38:43] believe whatever you're going to use
[1:38:45] before use it use me you know it's the
[1:38:47] same thing when I sat over there God
[1:38:49] said you have an ability abity to use
[1:38:51] what I've given unto you amen and that's
[1:38:54] where he's at he has nobody can speak I
[1:38:56] just read it this evening nobody no two
[1:38:58] preachers are alike amen and if they're
[1:39:00] alike one of's a
[1:39:03] fake I'll just tell you that now amen
[1:39:06] because God moves on you the whole body
[1:39:08] is made up by many different members of
[1:39:10] the body amen it takes us all in her
[1:39:13] there's going to be people that clap
[1:39:14] their hands there's going to be people
[1:39:15] that shout there's going to be people
[1:39:17] that preach and sing and Lord have mercy
[1:39:18] I tell you Andrew and and y'all can sing
[1:39:20] good good Lord y'all got some singers
[1:39:22] down here but you get in the presence of
[1:39:24] God and all of a sudden you join your
[1:39:25] lick of fire it's like in his body amen
[1:39:28] the lung look hooked up to the heart and
[1:39:30] the blood's running through there and
[1:39:31] it's getting it moving amen your body
[1:39:33] starts going what is it it's a body
[1:39:35] working together amen it's a body moving
[1:39:38] and getting the Praises and the presence
[1:39:40] of God because what you have to do is
[1:39:42] surrender yourself amen but you have to
[1:39:44] have faith to believe God's going to use
[1:39:46] you like never before God's going to use
[1:39:49] you like never before and when it's
[1:39:51] being seen and God seeing that the
[1:39:53] people are seeing it they look at it on
[1:39:55] the internet amen you you're looking at
[1:39:57] you're seeing God moving in y'all's
[1:39:58] church amen you're seeing God move
[1:40:00] around the Bride of Jesus Christ around
[1:40:03] the world just not here but in the
[1:40:05] churches there there's Miracles taken
[1:40:07] places amen because someone has accepted
[1:40:10] the word of God by my stripes you are
[1:40:12] healed amen by my stripes I'll be there
[1:40:15] with you amen I thank God for you all

[1:40:21] the front row y'all must have got here
[1:40:23] early cuz they love the front row amen
[1:40:25] but I'm looking at it I'm saying you
[1:40:26] know you look at it because if you have
[1:40:28] a desire to go beyond your own abilities
[1:40:31] that means that you have something
[1:40:33] inside of you that says it's not me that
[1:40:35] does the work but it's him that does the
[1:40:37] work through me amen and we look at that
[1:40:39] and Moses here he is and you know you
[1:40:41] say well you know well well here I want
[1:40:43] to I want to I want to be more of a
[1:40:45] Christian next year I want you know
[1:40:47] that's that's most time that's one of
[1:40:48] them leaflets amen amen I put something
[1:40:51] in my Bible there back before dad passed
[1:40:54] away and I put it in there I need to
[1:40:57] know the leadership of the Holy Ghost on
[1:40:59] what to do with the church because the
[1:41:00] church had dwindle down to a couple
[1:41:03] people I put it in her I written it in
[1:41:06] her ask God for the answer within 30
[1:41:10] days we had the
[1:41:13] answer not the kind of answer I was
[1:41:15] looking
[1:41:17] for but God sometimes will push you
[1:41:21] into a place and close all the doors I
[1:41:24] heard it spoke this week he put you into
[1:41:26] a place that you have to believe on God
[1:41:31] you have to have faith to believe to
[1:41:33] make the word work within you because if
[1:41:36] you can't believe it yourself he's going
[1:41:38] to put you into a place you have to lean

[1:47:22] ability over to Jesus Christ to move you
[1:47:25] into a realm that you're no longer
[1:47:28] living a part of this world you're
[1:47:29] looking for that change when you take
[1:47:31] that step in the morning you're like

[1:47:47] couldn't think of anything and I was
[1:47:48] like my goodness out 90 years what could
[1:47:51] happen I look at it for you all if we
[1:47:54] live to be 90 if we live to be 100 or
[1:47:57] 120 we could still say I live for Jesus
[1:48:00] Christ every moment that I was here
[1:48:02] every breath that you take you're
[1:48:03] looking at I watched a man going through
[1:48:05] some stuff L last week and I was like
[1:48:07] every every moment he was going through
[1:48:09] something and you know it was like I was
[1:48:11] like my goodness you know but in my my
[1:48:13] mind I was going there's nothing I can
[1:48:14] do but the whole time I'm sitting there
[1:48:16] Lord Jesus I'm asking you to come what's
[1:48:18] going on right now I don't don't
[1:48:20] understand it but you do I'm asking God
[1:48:23] help him right now he can't help himself
[1:48:26] but you said you'd be an everpresent
[1:48:28] help in the time of need many times we
[1:48:30] forget when we go to battle we got to
[1:48:32] pull our sword and that sword is Jesus
[1:48:35] Christ amen amen it's no time to go into
[1:48:37] a fetal setback position it's a time to
[1:48:39] step forward in the word of God Amen be
[1:48:42] diligent about the work amen be diligent
[1:48:45] about studying the Bibles and learning
[1:48:46] more about his love amen learning you
[1:48:48] say well well what happened but Jesus
[1:48:51] well let's look at it thank you Jesus
[1:48:53] said it like this right here yeah if I
[1:48:56] can find it really
[1:49:01] quick Jesus when he went into the Garden
[1:49:04] of
[1:49:06] Gethsemane I'm not going to read it but
[1:49:09] here
[1:49:10] goes God in flesh walking into the
[1:49:15] garden he walked in there in pain and
[1:49:17] Agony yes sir he had had something a
[1:49:20] burden within him I'm here to save the
[1:49:24] world he was here but what did he do he
[1:49:28] cried he prayed he prayed so long until
[1:49:32] his blood became his te teardrops of
[1:49:34] blood as they were coming out and he was
[1:49:37] pressing he was looking for what can I
[1:49:39] do let this cup pass for me Lord let
[1:49:42] this cup pass for me and he went back
[1:49:44] and his his his head disciples that were
[1:49:46] there with him were
[1:49:49] asleep yeah they weren't in his pain he
[1:49:53] had to go at it alone you many times
[1:49:56] think you have to go at it alone you're
[1:49:59] that is the individual walk of the
[1:50:02] Gentiles it's been given to us that
[1:50:04] we're individuals we're not saved as a
[1:50:06] nation but I look at it and I say I want
[1:50:08] my walk to be so close with Jesus Christ
[1:50:11] that if my time comes at this moment I
[1:50:13] will step from this moral immortality
[1:50:15] amen there's nothing to cry about I step
[1:50:18] from here to there and I'm good amen
[1:50:20] I'll be there wherefore we're so
[1:50:22] compassed about with such a great a
[1:50:23] cloud of witnesses amen lay aside that
[1:50:25] sin that so easy beset you and run this
[1:50:28] race with patience and be ready amen
[1:50:30] that's what we've got to do but I looked
[1:50:32] at it here's Jesus as he's walking in
[1:50:34] that Garden he's looking for and he's
[1:50:37] looking for something different than
[1:50:39] God's will but he finally surrendered if
[1:50:43] Jesus had to surrender his own will not
[1:50:45] my will but thine will be done that's a
[1:50:50] the same thing we need to do you got to
[1:50:52] have enough Faith to believe I have a
[1:50:54] purpose in this life if it takes me
[1:50:57] preaching singing running dancing
[1:51:00] praising God laying hands on the sick I
[1:51:01] want to do what I need to do to be up
[1:51:04] building the kingdom of God I want to
[1:51:06] praise him more every day I want to lift
[1:51:08] up his name more every day and I don't
[1:51:10] want to ever lose sight of where I'm
[1:51:12] going amen because the devil is going to
[1:51:14] give you Blindside you every once in a
[1:51:16] while amen but sometimes he'll come in
[1:51:18] he'll come in really soft
[1:51:20] we got to be ready for his cunning
[1:51:22] activities but we look at it we are
[1:51:24] looking Beyond where we're at right now
[1:51:27] Moses had to realize that I am not going
[1:51:29] to be doing this on my own God's going
[1:51:31] to be with me the god of Abraham is
[1:51:34] going to be with me I will walk with him
[1:51:36] I will talk with him he will be there he
[1:51:38] will give me guidance and you know God
[1:51:40] had so much trust in him that what he
[1:51:44] said what Moses said it would
[1:51:47] happen he knew he wasn't going to ask
[1:51:50] ask
[1:51:51] anything we don't go and ask for Golden
[1:51:54] doors and don't ask for Golden House
[1:51:57] what we're looking for is a rebuilding
[1:51:59] of Jesus Christ inside of our life
[1:52:01] before 2024 comes in I want to have God
[1:52:04] so much in me that I the angels are
[1:52:07] around me all the time amen that they're
[1:52:09] welcome here amen you look at it you say

[1:52:20] burning bush he may have come through
