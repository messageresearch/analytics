[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you I would like to speak to you tonight on the hurt will not stop the music if it will turn with me to Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16 this evening a man Isaiah chapter 65 in verse 16 that who he who blessed himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of the truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear in the God of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes for behold I create a new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem of rejoicing and her people of joy and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and enjoy and my people and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her nor the voice of crime I'm gonna tell you I'm trying to behave here while I read the scripture and there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled these days for the child shall shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them and they shall not build an another inhabit and they shall not plant in another eat for the days of the tree are the days of my people in mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands and they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the bless of the Lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lion shall eat straw like the bull and the dust shall be the Serpent's meat and they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mount saith the Lord revelations chapter 19 and verse 6 and I heard as it were a voice of a great multitude a great a voice of many waters a voice of mighty thunderings saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saint and he saith them to me right they blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to raise it before the Lord amen let's pray Almighty God Lord you have been invited and we know that wherever you're invited you come and Lord we just pray that we've been able to make you feel so welcome Lord minister to us in a special way tonight anoint our thoughts anoint our words we're so pleased to have reach and everyone here this evening and we pray that you would bless this audience in this congregation those that are out this afternoon we pray that you touch them father I ask you to bless brother Jake and sister Mary I pray that you would watch over them as they travel to st.

new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God now love these words and God shall wipe away all tears can you say those two words with me from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he that said unto me write for these words are true and faithful brother Branham is speaking in the Easter message in in and the cease preach and the sermon I know and it makes a quotation I want to share with you why this God let troubles come does anyone in this building ever had some trouble why does God let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him those troubles bring us closer fellowship with God but the man said what was it he said of the Son of God 1900 and some years ago this afternoon he was led from prison he was taken from the judgments eaten from there to the Hall of scourging from there up gall Gotha pulled up a hill Simon saw reme helping him bury the cross and dare he died Oh Rock of Ages with his blood beat out of him his body stripped hallelujah he said great big gobs of a mocking soldiers spit upon his face and he said if my kingdom was of this world I'd ask my father and he would he would give me legions of angels that would come and fight for me but this is not my kingdom but my kingdom come are you with me now thy kingdom come Thy will be done and it will be here pretty soon thy kingdom come Thy will be done when Billy suddenly said one time that in every tree said an angel he just put your hand loosen just point your finger that's all you have to do and we'll settle this question down here he said my debt the truth Caiaphas's look mine said he saved others but himself he cannot save it was the greatest compliment that was ever paid him if he saved himself he can't save others so he gave his life that he could save others oh ma oh we like sheep it's gonna slay and God laid upon him the iniquity of us all he was led to a slaughter like a sheep and led like a sheep dumb before her Shearer's open not his mouth yet he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was on him upon him and with His stripes we are healed how could you reject such a Maxis love to see him and there he go staggering up a hillside poor little weak frail body bending beneath the load I think of that point that set there that day and he caught a glimpse of it and he wrote mid rendering rocks and darkening sky my Saviour bowed his head and died the open veil revealed a way to heavens Joy's in endless days what a savior how could we how could i reject such matchless love who would do that for me who would do that for you he said if we could only just prefigure a picture turn our camera now one morning down in jerusalem i listened in the window and i hear of noise what is it it's a priest saying away with such a man I can hear a little woman run to the front of the crowd and say what has he done what has he done but but heal the sick and and raised the dead and and brought delivers to those that were in captive the big cruel hand would smack her in the mouth and say would you listen to that woman instead of your priest of cruel Roman whip beating him it's kind of an awful picture but let's raise it to the shades and look I hear something bumping down the street over the cobblestone and a look out the wind and I see a little man with a white robe who wove throughout without seams laying across his shoulders packing the old crosses it bumps down the street his shoulders they're rubbing wrong and I notice a little garment there's little spots all over it those little swatches he goes up the hill they begin to get bigger and bigger and while they all run into one now a great big bloody splash across his legs that's second Adam the seed of the woman that be of death humming around his head and there he goes up the hill knowing that soon that devil will certainly had the wool pulled over his eyes there the devil said I'm kind of man that claims to be God how could he I challenged him to do a stunner one of these tricks in front of me and turned him into Brad rocks into Brandon he failed to do it how could he stand if I if I if I be a prophet and let a Roman soldier put a rag around his face and and and hit him on the head with a stick and now if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and he said still he's a faker I'll come and sting him with my sting of death and I'll get him now oh how he failed when he hung him on the cross and that bee was humming humming around him if that bee or that insect of that stinger ever slings and anchors that stinger deep when it goes way down that stinger ever gets again he'll never sting again he leaves his finger in the flesh death could sting a sinner and get by with it that time he let his stinger into him Manuel's flesh and Emanuel pulled the Stinger out of him no wonder Saint Paul could say years after that when that bee of death was coming around him Oh death worse your steak grave worship victory but thanks be to God and giveth us the victory to the Lord Jesus Christ death was conquered that he can hell around that beacon Baucis saying I got you but we can point over yonder to an empty grave and say thanks be to God that gives us the victory through the Lord Jesus Christ he can make a noise but as long as he's stinging you he ain't got no more stinger when he anchored his stinger in the flesh of Emanuel God's flesh among us it pulled the stinger out of death and that's God's idea of his first conference so Jesus would be sent to the earth to feel hurt Paul would say it like this for though I would desire to glory I shall not be a fool for I will say the truth but now I forbear lest any man should think about me of which he seeth me to be or heareth of me unless I should get exalted above measure this is a Messenger of God that will write your New Testament unless I be exalted above measure the the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to buffett me lest I should get exalted above measure you're talking about operating and dimensions a Messenger of God that would detail the writing of the Scriptures all the way from the book of Romans all the way through and even in that humanity confess lest I get exalted and think myself something great are you with me God allowed a messenger of Satan to perfectly but it means time after time after time struggling and that enemy comes to destroy he gets an opportunity to destroy and to hurt and to mangle listen Satan's nobody to negotiate with he's nobody to negotiate with he feeds on his own meat he feeds on his own people and now he's allowed to to work on that piece of flesh a pause and it would come it would come and it would come over and over again now notice this you might be like Paul for a moment for this thing I besought the Lord thrice I would say he's a man of authority I chase walking in special places in this condition that kept coming to him this messenger of the devil that kept coming this thing that just kept coming he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me this is God's response to him my grace oh this a grace won't take you where he can't keep you hallelujah it's the amazing grace of God let me just say this you know man holds himself no man holds himself it's the amazing grace of Almighty God that protects us the unmerited favor of God God said my grace is sufficient for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in mine infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me if I gotta have infirmities I won't trade infirmities for the lack of God I gotta have him I want you to know this God can operate without me but you can't operate without him are you with me oh brother on I'm too big visit a graveyard in that graveyard its judges lawyers doctors paupers matters a little bit of difference between the gravestones has different sayings on it but it's all the same results because of Adam's fall because of Adam's fall that is the result but because of God's amazing grace that's not our end come on church I'm glad that this mortal life however long it will be it's like a vapor for a short time it appears a little wild then it's gone you live to be a hundred years old she's gone Christine is getting ready to turn 98 sister Nancy's mother 90 years 8 years old but let me just say in this pants of eternity that's nothing that's absolutely nothing god I'd rather have Jesus than anything Peter would write it like this that the trial of your faith understand this it's not the trial of God's faith it's the trying of your faith just remember this you are what you are in depression the trying of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth that though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory unto the appearing of Jesus Christ job 23 and verse 10 but he knoweth the way that I take and when he had tried me I shall come forth as gold let me to say this year the book of Job is like like a a sound of an orchestra music every one of our lives is going to play out in this span of time none of us has ever been through what job's been through I know you could hurt people you just dare not tell us people how some of people are doing because if you're not careful an hour goes by and they have any got to the good part yet I generally don't have a lot of time for that but I kind of move along but let me just say this is nobody's had a roughest time as Joe are you with me and God knowing when he came to earth or what they were going to do for him he wrote it in the scriptures wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon him he knew what Rome would do to him but he came anyway he came anyway he became a man do you think that those words are Beyonc involving an illegitimate child and those difficult words that he had to hear because he had to overcome everything that you've got to overcome some people say well I've never nobody has ever had it as bad as I have that's because you're using just a mirror you're only using a mirror if you can over gathered it over yourself that's a lot of people's got self itis and that self itis just absorbs them and consumes them they'll never do nobody else no good because self itis are you anything second Corinthians chapter four and verse eight we're troubled on every side so you're in good company yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down not destroyed always bearing about in the body of the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body for we which are all ladel ever to the death of Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you and we haven't the same faith spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken and we also believe and therefore speak are you with me brother branham said there had been no rainbow until first the flood came and Noah was pressed into that condition that he was in to float forty days and night in a storm in a little arm pitching up and down in the water and it was after the flood was all over that he saw a rainbow for the first time the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Hope the Covenant of promise after he went through tribulation it was then he saw the promise sometimes the strains of our humanity's almost more than we can bear I'm reminded about a little boy that I've told you about before but I want to share it one more time with you his name was Glenn Cunningham Glenn Cunningham when he was a young man he was burned up he was burned by a cook stove fire and the fire came out on him and burned his bundi slat and burned his legs and it burned him to the point - when they took him to the doctors the doctor said we must cut his legs off they'll never be any good he pleaded with him and he let me keep my legs let me keep my legs he was just a boy let me keep my legs they take him home we understand we now understand the intensity of fires and damage but this boy had came to a spot to word that he couldn't use his legs anymore he looked like he was going to be in a wheelchair forever they'd push him out on the front up on the front porch and he'd sit and watch all the children go by after a while he got himself down - there was a picket fence he goes there day after day to watch the children go by what a moment it would be that he would reach out and grab a hold of the Finch grab ahold of those pickets and pull himself up for the first time and stand upon those legs that he hadn't been able to use in quite a long time and he stood himself up held on for a bit day after day he'd go out and pull himself up one day he he took a step and he started moving down the the pickax and he wouldn't take another step and he'd start moving down the biscuits nobody was watching but he was sometimes indeed since side of him all of the hurt that had came to his body he was determined that it would not consume him are you with me now you got to come to a spot that yes I've had to go through some earth and yes I've had to go through some tough times but I will not let that define me [Applause] couldn't begin to go backwards and forwards on that fence and after a while he began to take steps on his own without heaven and it wasn't long until Glenn began to walk on his own but he was not satisfied with walking he wanted to run he begin to run scars you know he begun to run all the hurt and the pain that was continuous he continued to run Glenn would become one of the fastest athletes in the entire world and he became the first man to approach a four-minute mile and he became the world's fastest man at that time Paul would say it like this I've been beaten I've been shipwrecked he would give it an incredible list but do you know that he said I'm not quick but the random had a lot of things said about him in his life lot of damage was told about him and in his life and critics told a lot of things about him as a young man he was a bootleggers son he was poor while he was the only man that would have a testimony that I met an angel an angel indicated he said about six foot tall dark complected and he stood alone on a lot of those pulpits he became known as the man with the angel and he stood there night after night and the tough cases would come to him to be prayed for and he would make challenges bring me the toughest case that you have there would be spots to where brother Brandon would pray for an individual and they'd pray for him again and I did pray for him again I did pray for him again on one occasion after praying the Sabbath time he reminded the devil come out of church so the next time you hear a critic of the prophet of God take him back to this prayer all of his hurt didn't stop the music come on you're not the only one that's been on attack in your life Satan has tried to stop your music through life he's tried to stop you and destroy you that hurt will not stop the music is that on it's that on yeah make sure that's off all right I don't want to get a sick I got a big job this week he told Satan after after the seven time he said I was commissioned by an angel of the Lord and brother John he knew the devil knew let's just get right down to the spot he knew the devil knew come on why didn't say to make a big challenge then the devil knew that he's had an angel in the cave come on church the devil can whisper in your ear all he wants to that you're backslidden you're a lot of Christian but he knows what you got cuz every morning when you roll out of bed in the morning he knows that you can destroy his kingdom he knows he knows oh I feel like preaching he knows he knows his kingdoms coming down he knows he's only got a short time to work he knows you're the bride of Jesus Christ he knows [Applause] brother branham would talk about a lady that was a that was a songwriter her name was Fanny Crosby she became blind as a child she was a woman that would be used by man named moody other great ministers would actually be able to use her gift to be able to preach openly in the streets and to attract huge crowds born blind lived in total poverty I would say that every person in this building today is much better off financially than she was but she refused to sing songs with national pride and for the days of war she refused to sell songs for for her for things like the country music of that day and they offered her incredible money just to write those songs let me just say this you Satan will make you an offer he'll make you a lot of offers in your life maybe it's a job and maybe it's an education or maybe it's a man or a woman how foolish it is to sell your your birthright before I go any further I was on a plane with a man that was a musician he's a quite famous musician we were sitting and he and his wife was said in the plane Minh and they were sitting beside of me and they was asking me where I was going I was on the trip to China and so he said I'm just coming I'm just coming for a boat trip from the Caribbean I've been on five different cruises and we're just we're just making her way home and so that was the time when the man that was named had just died and he said you're a preacher so you'll understand anointing and he said you see that man named Prince was like many many many preachers said you have to sell yourself to God but these stars have to sell himself to a dark realm and the higher they raise the darker it becomes and he begun to make these statements he said that's the reason Michael Jackson couldn't sleep he said that's the reason he couldn't sleep he was living in such a dark realm he was living in such a dark realm to where that he he couldn't get rest or come back down you tell me he was happy I don't care how much room walking he was doing and think about the blindness of their Jehovah Witness they thought he was the Messiah that's a very little unknown fact but they promoted him as a messiah I'll tell you what he was a pervert out of Hill they're only now discovering in his trash and his nonsense it's kind of like the day that just hung himself in prison the other day he hurt a lot of people and he thought because of his power and his money that he could abuse young girls and get by with it forever let me to say shanon's will find you out and one day you'll come back to meet those sins and it was six a coward he couldn't face a judge what made him hanged himself oh no it wasn't he didn't want to tell him nobody else he couldn't live with himself sins cruel let me just tell you sins cruel brother branham tell us about a doctor that was one of the women doctors and I'm gonna say this very delicately that was one of the first abortionist doctors and he said when she came to die she kept screaming put me out put me out put me out all I can see is those babies at the window one day I was called as a pastor here I was called to a home I was working for you brother Thomas a nice called to a home where a lady that had set here and she wanted me to stop her and I don't know if it was her husband I don't know I don't know what the deal was it's not part of the issue now and she was standing there with a vast of booze in her hand and she was standing at the door and she was standing with that booze and it was shaking like that and she said I need help I need help I was the one to help her but she couldn't let this go she couldn't let this go let me just go on in my preach to get now you got it warm enough now I can preach I'll save that but the homer felt led for me to go it and pray for a family they hadn't come for a while and he said I want you to go visit him one more time and it was a Sunday afternoon and I climbed up on their steps and you was with me and I climbed up on their steps and I knocked on the door and they were having a party right through the door and the knocked on the door and I knocked on their door and they stood there with their booze in their hand and they made fun of me standing on the door what'd you do brother on oh man and I'm an honest man I'm real it hurt my feelings hurt my feelings but I've got instructions brother Nathaniel you would have never known these people but every one of those people are dead today they're all dead at Party Time it won't last forever the Rompin and the playing and being the girl that everybody's fantasy dream I don't last forever I don't last forever because even when Satan gets done with you he don't want you but they're helpless on the outside of the door today if you could have an interview with them a they want to be right here they'd trade seats with anybody here Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe you can name all of them Patsy Cline all of them would like to trade seats I find it interesting I was sitting in the back room and Bethenny singing here and while I'm studying Matheny as he's singing it dropped in my heart that's a gift that Patsy Cline had why here why in this place God brought her on incredible deliverance and she's listening brought her an incredible deliverance and I helped and they made an album and when they made that album when they went and made the album with the la Fontaine's helped make the album put it together there was an old man that played music on that album and when he got done he said you might be interested to know that I once played for a girl named Patsy Cline I'd say it's a quite a conch quite an incredible leap between Patsy Cline and Bethany Lawson now what you don't know is I just set before her just a couple days before with her daddy and I told her something that she hadn't told nobody that there was two people that was trying to get her to sell her gift to the world and that was the spirit that was trying to destroy her life so what if the world can make you a star so much so light you'll have your ten minutes of fame and then it's over with and you're going to face eternity with this somebody told me their excuse for not coming to church it's quite an investment to sit in church two hours quite an investment I'll tell you how it's going to be longer than two hours there's nothing in this world that I would trade for I've seen some good places I met good people but being a good person don't give you eternal life having degrees all over your walls and having phenomenal money I don't mean anything they don't mean anything some of you know this i go to i go to auction estates and and I go to estate auctions let me say it like that and I tried to go to ones that are very wealthy people because wealthy people have a lot of toys because money don't satisfy so they had the best furniture they have the best of everything and in an auction in the back for nothing you can buy for pennies on a dollar you kids starting out that's a good place for you to buy your furniture you can go buy you can go buy some of the best couches for pennies on a dollar and buy a $5,000 couch for $300 or you can go to Shoals and buy a piece of junk [Applause] Jim you work in my home a lot brother Terry you work in my home a lot people say oh you got good stuff yeah I do I do I got good stuff but I pay pennies on the dollar for it I equip my entire office for less than less than a thousand dollars and the table alone is a seven thousand dollar table now there have no doubt said a lawyer they use the table that I used in his office and I can tell you the lifestyle that he lived he wasn't a Christian so he left it all he left it off he left it all don't admire that I'm saying all that to say this go admire that don't admire those things that will deteriorate and go away got it Myers act hope I didn't hurt your feelings there some of you want to know my business how how I got successful well that's what I did you buy things for pennies on a dollar and you sell it for the real dollar I don't don't try to be my competition ambitious and here's a woman it's offered you know it hurt to hear people laugh at her and make fun of her it hurt one day she's walking up into her house and then she's walking they said burn Fannie when you get to heaven how will you ever know that it's Jesus she turned around under inspiration and wrote a song I shall know him I shall know him I shall know him by the nail prints in his hands many of you walk to the altar to one of her songs pass me not o gentle Savior hear my humble cry while on others now are calling one of my favorite hymns is blessed assurance Jesus is mine all what a foretaste of glory divine I'm an heir of salvation purchase of God or the brand of mentions another woman and her name was Susanna Wesley brother Owen talks about that she spent three hours a day in prayer before her day even started she also wrote through her life incredible amounts of of mourning devotionals never wrote a book never assembled them most of them burned up in a fire two homes burned down she gave birth to 19 children none of them died at birth no this is one of the most difficult things is one of her children died by an accidental smothering of the nurse hurt her husband was worthless her husband was worthless he never paid their bills he never he never was applied himself at anything in life he was constantly trying to write a book he was addicted to weaknesses of his life here she was with a man that was worthless nine children dies three more of her children would bow as babies but two of her kids one of them to be John Wesley would be the messenger of the day and the other would be Charles Wesley who would be one of the greatest songwriters of all town it was birthed out of tremendous hurt I'd like to just just wave a banner tonight shaken you're not a winner [Applause] brother banner mentions this man he's not the messenger of the age but he was a powerful man he was a disciple of John being a disciple of John he was very well-known you would know him when I tell you his name Polycarp everybody else is getting put to death and he's 86 years old he knew his time was coming because they arrested one of the men that was carrying these letters carinii sermons they arrested that man that man told that he was working for Polycarp so he knew that they were coming he knew when they opened the door what they were there for gotta give him a vision only the week before that he was going to die by fire in quit showed up to rested he said if you could just give me one thing let me pray he said I'm gonna be a while but let me pray he got off his knees he started prayer and he prayed for two hours and in his prayer he prayed that God would forgive every man forgive the Pope forgive the men that were against him are we back and ready today he asked God to forgive every one of those first few ters and he asked God that he could be such a sacrifice that he could be a testimony even as he died the men that came to arrest him and a hard time some matter of fact they stopped on the way to where they were going to burning and they tried to push him off finally they stopped him that did push him off said no way can we let you go be burned at the stake he got up and dusted himself off and said I've seen in a vision that I'm gonna die by fire he's gonna be with me he climbed back up and when he got better I asked him do you have any last requests he said would you let me preach a little while and so he preached two hours while he was standing on top of the wood and men were given their hearts to God all over the place and then he quoted our Lord Jesus into the hands I commit my spirit they lift the fire and the fire begins to come up around him begins to consuming and it wouldn't touch him the fire refused to touch him so man took a sword and started in inspiriting and out of his body came a dove their hurt didn't destroy the music brother Jordan you'll be interested to know brother Jacob and sister Mary came from the Hutterite community it's okay to leave that community had to leave with the clothes on his back and escape when they escaped they don't have a opportunity to work at same job do the same things and he escaped at great cost but brother Jake did just didn't escape himself but brother jake has spent much of his life going back and getting more and there's people sitting in Edmonton and all over Canada because that man that stood up a little while ago and waved at you that man was willing to receive a lot of hurt for the cause of the gospel of Jesus Christ rather Jake I just tell you now well done I'm no voice at all to stream it to you but one day God will scream it to the echoes of the heavens well done I want to tell you this God pays all his debts he'll not forget your children your grandchildren he'll not forget home Jake he'll not forget them I tell you that in the name of the Lord he'll not forget and for that part's reason you probably had to come God won't forget oh they may look a long way from home now but let me just say God won't forget him [Applause] well you know that or not that was a special moment my testimony yeah another they were leading those Saints as they were coming to da they were leading him up to a cliff lead him up to a cliff and they were running him through with a spear and a sword and finally one comes up to his turn he said I just can't do it and he said would you take my place because every one that I take a spear and throw them off there's an angel standing there and I've been watching angels I've been watching angels grab ahold of them these are not fictitious stories not something that's made up but I want to remind the devil tonight all of these heart hurt and all of his permit it has not stopped me and neither will it for by his amazing grace I'll get up tomorrow morning and rise again to be an overcomer and I'll do that day after day after day after day after day after day [Applause] I'd like for you to sing this with me and brother branham would come and write a write his own verse on the wings of a snow-white doves and he wrote his own verse that hurt didn't stop his music you've been a very attentive audience for me tonight thank you god bless you I pray tonight and all the energies
