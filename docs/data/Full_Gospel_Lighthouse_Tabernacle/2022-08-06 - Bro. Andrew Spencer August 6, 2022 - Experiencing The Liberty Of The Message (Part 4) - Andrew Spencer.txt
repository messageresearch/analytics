part of our lives for a long time and we plan on spending eternity together amen that's i just love the bride of jesus christ and the lord's just been so good to us i the bride's got the best the world's got what it's got but the bride's got the best and now i tell you what it's it's certainly a privilege to be living in this hour that we're living in and i'd like to say thank you to all of you that were able to go to brother joel green's camp meeting there and it was a great success and brother ron will give you a few more details on that in the morning he'll be speaking for us in the morning and so just be praying for brother ron and we're just looking under the lord we're certainly thankful to have our pastor back home with us and and so we're just looking unto the lord and i believe it's going to be very soon that we're going to hear some doctors scream out that cancer-free battle's over jesus already said it so i believe it i believe it so i'll take him at his word you know why shouldn't we believe for it why shouldn't we believe it we got every devil in hell telling us we shouldn't why shouldn't we believe it let's stand toe-to-toe with that enemy let's just knock him right in the head i believe brother tim sent me a note today said stomp a mud hole in the devil so it's i believe that's what i'll do if that's all right i'm going to need some help tonight if that's all right maybe y'all maybe you'll help me do that i believe y'all willing participants for this evening amen amen god's good to us and we certainly love you with the love of the lord if you have your bibles this evening i'd like to look over in the book of leviticus uh chapter 23 leviticus chapter 23 and verse verse 9 through 11 then also down to revelations chapter one and babies crying that means it's a sign of life in this church it's growing we're going to build this church one way or another so amen amen leviticus chapter 23 and verse 9. before we read let's just speak to the author of the word and how many here by an uplifted hand would have a need or a desire on their heart that they'd like to see met this evening amen i believe dr jesus is here amen let's just speak to the lord father we we recognize lord that you are here in our midst lord jesus because you told us in your word that where two or three are gathered in my name there you would be in the midst of them father and we recognize lord that we can bind our hearts together with christian love lord and we can recognize that you're going to do something specific here this evening because your children have gathered one more time around the cork his father and lord we've come to feed upon the unfailing body word of the son of man and we asked lord that you would take the word of life and you would rightly divide it father lord jesus said pray that you'd open our hearts lord to receive the things that you have for us here this this weekend father where thank you lord for the meetings that took place at north carolina we we thank you for the meetings that are going on around the world but father this is a time that we've come to sit down lord jesus and asking lord that you'd move on behalf of your children right here father you see their hands you see their desires lord they've got questions and lord you've got all the answers and we ask lord that this one that we've been fellowshipping with lord that you would come and that you'd manifest yourself right here lord we even recognize lord that there's someone greater than ourselves that is here tonight lord come to do a work and we just want to be obedient to you tonight lord and just get ourselves out of the way father may you come and have the preeminence in this church service today in the name of the lord jesus christ amen leviticus chapter 23 in verse 9 and the lord spake unto moses saying speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you become into the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and you shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted for you on the moral after the sabbath the priest shall wave it revelations chapter 1 revelation chapter 1 and verse 12 this afternoon i know we have some that are out sick this weekend so we want to be remembering them in prayer as well amen many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivers him all revelations chapter 1 and verse 12 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks and in the midst of the seven golden candle sticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and a girt about the pabst with a golden girdle and his head and his hairs were like oh as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like on the fine brass as if they had burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-widget sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his hand laid his right hand on me and saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the lord i think it's amazing to not to be able to recognize that we are not just looking at jesus through a glass darkly but we are seeing him face to face and you begin to think about all of the prophets throughout the throughout the old testament that they longed to look on him but here that we recognize that we are looking upon jesus face to face when brother branham would lay that out in the church age book we see his seven personages that are laying right here and we recognize that we can go back throughout throughout the old testament and go through the new testament as you comb through it you can see that the i am that was there at the very beginning that would roll the very worlds off of his fingertips was the same i am that was there with elijah and he was there with elisha and he was there throughout his prophets moses and on down throughout the scriptures and we recognize that it is that same i am that is right here standing in the midst of the seven church ages and right here in the midst of the church of the living god there's there's somebody that is standing here and we recognize that that is the that is the great i am it's not a god that's changing it's not a god that's going it's not a god that's leaving us but he is the i am he is present for our situation he is present for our needs he is present for everything that we'll ever go through and i was i was listening to the prophet today when he was when he was talking there and it is the rising of the sun he said when when jesus christ came and he conquered he conquered everything that there was to be conquered he conquered sin he conquered he conquered sickness he said he said he went on and he conquered all of the trinity of satan he said there satan was the author of death he said but he was the possessor of hell and he was the possessor of gray of the grave and here we are recognizing tonight that that all of the trinity of satan everything that he possessed as his own that that was his own house that jesus christ rose up the mighty conqueror on the third day and he conquered death hell and the grave and we recognize tonight that that that satan himself don't even have the keys to his own kingdom tonight the things that once held man captive jesus christ holds in his hands tonight and to think that tonight that everything that's been stacked up against your life every every little detail that's been laid out in your dna everything jesus christ is the answer to everything that you'll ever have need of and to think that that it's all wrapped up inside of one man and that man's name is none other than jesus christ he conquered every enemy that you could ever come up against he conquered brother ron's cancer he conquered brother randy's cancer he conquered every need he conquered every battle that you can ever go through so so tonight the battle is already won we'd like to declare we'd already like to declare victory in this place tonight knowing that all of the things that held men for captive captive for so many years that one man jesus christ he proved that he conquered the trinity of satan that day at calvary and to think that where we're living at in the as a church of the living god that this message is such a reality it is this word is the only reality that there is lay odyssey it can't offer you a reality everything that they offer you the the hollywood it shines but this gospel is glowing with the realities of jesus christ and we realize that it is this word it is this message it is this power that'll take our mortal bodies and they'll change our mortal bodies and this mortality will put on immortality and this corruption will put on incorruption as paul would say in first corinthians 15 we recognize that this message is the greatest thing that's ever been placed in the hand of almighty god and i think tonight if we're ever going to preach liberty amongst the church of the living god we ought to be preaching right now and i believe if there's young people that need an experience with the liberty of this message it ought it ought to be preached like never before if we've got if we've got an older generation that need healing there's there's healing laying right here in this message and there's somebody here that needs needs a divine touch from almighty god needs answers need to be met i believe that it can be experienced right now in the power of this message this message ain't got weaker as the days gone by this message has got stronger and stronger and we're coming behind it with an amen if brother branham would say he said if there's a great big amen across the room let us say amen to it and if there ever was a time to believe for miracles it's right now when god has connoted himself he's emptied himself out into the church of the living god he's just changed his mass this is the bride coming of jesus christ this is christ in bright form what you see in your brother what you're seeing your sister this ain't some work this ain't some man's idea this ain't a school of ideology but this is the victory of jesus christ in body form again and you're not just fellowshipping with another man but you're fellowshipping with the same exact one that abraham was fellowshipping with he had a conversation with him that he was going to have a son and there on that day when he had his back turned towards the tent he started fellowshipping with the same one that had talked to him all throughout those years and it was that shame melchizedek that came by his way and changed his body i declare unto the church of the living god it's that same melchizedek that we're fellowshipping with right now and i'll declare unto you it'll be one of these mornings between the hours of six and nine that one that you've been fellowshipping with that one that you've been entertaining will change your mortal bodies you'll not go by the way of the grave but this mortality will put on immortality and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall be changed glory hallelujah hallelujah the secret things belong unto the lord but the things which are revealed belong to us this is our possession this ain't this ain't luther's day this ain't wesley's day this is a bright age and if there ever was a time to believe it it's right now i want to tell you that our bags our script bags are full we've got stones that been rolled around in honey and we're just looking we're just looking for giants just now we're looking for cancer giants we're looking for coveted giants we're looking for depression giants we're looking for anxiety types we're looking for suicide giants because we've got a rock and it's a rock to a fence for a lot of people but this rock is a rock of revelation hallelujah hallelujah brother marlon would say in the statue of the perfect man he said christ never sent me to build no organization he didn't send me to build no he didn't sell me to build no intellectualism or denominationalism or to build another church he said he sent me here to build individuals and to be the stature of jesus christ that they might be a powerhouse they might be a powerhouse a dwelling place for almighty god the spirit by his word that he would come and live in a people and i think that tonight if we if we've ever grabbed a hold of a reality it's it's this message tonight you know when when you watch when the when the pride of jesus christ when that group that is catching the message of the hour and the reality of it you watch as the unbelievers the group begins to thin out just like when moses was up there and he sent out those 12 spies and those 12 spies went out there because it was the message of the hour for their day to go out there and to claim canaan's land the promise that was given unto abraham he was given unto them and he took that promise and there was only two of them that went out there and believed that that was the message of the hour and he watched as the group began to thin out when those so-called message believers or the majority of those so-called believers they didn't believe it but the message is today it's the promised word for this day that only the elect of god are going to be able to walk out there walk out of there in the face of all the criticism walk out there in the face of all the the darkness of this world and go out there and accept this message and believe this message i i declare that that pride is on earth right now i declare that it's she's here right now i've declared that she is him and i declare that all power in heaven and in earth that was given unto him is in the church of the living god i'm not i'm not i'm not ashamed of him i'm not ashamed of this power i'm not ashamed of this truth and if william branham could stand there right in the face of all of those critics right in the face of all those maniacs the same power that raised jesus christ from the grave is in the church of the living god it's something that you need to grab a hold of and let it be an experience for your own self if he could stand there he could stand there and he could call black black and white white how about the church of the living god how about we call out sin how about we call out what's right how about we believe for miracles there's people all over this building tonight that are in need of miracles and i tell you god ain't run out on them there's people that are sitting here tonight that need a true baptism of the holy ghost he ain't run out of it tonight there's people that are sitting here that need their eyes turned to from darkness unto life he ain't run out of his turning power i tell you still got his eye on you brother branham would say in the layout or excuse me in the ephesian church age he said that there he is with the seven stars in his right hand the right hand or or right hand or arm signifies the power and the authority of god psalms 44 and 3 tells us for they got the land for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and that arm in the light of thy countenance because thou hast favor unto them and i i think if there's ever was a time that a people had favor it's a church of the most high he said in that right hand of power our seven stars who according to revelations 1 and 20 are the seven church messengers he said that signifies that the very power and the authority of god are behind his messengers to every age he said they go forth in the fire and power of the holy ghost with the word and i don't know about you but that stirs my heart like never before to recognize that what was given to william branham but what was given to those seven church age messengers was that fire and the very unction of the holy ghost and it stirs our heart to recognize that we've got a short work to do here in lay odyssey and if we're ever going to run right now is the time to run if we're ever going to believe it young girls right now is the time to believe it if we're ever going to if we're ever going to put on and display the wedding garment if there ever was a time to to live this message it's right now it's not for a day gone by and it's not for in the future it's right now right now and to think that brother brother would say in the laodicean church age to think that there would come a time again that there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final h this bride has got something to say in revelations 10 it told us to prophesy again you're not coming up with your own words you're taking you're taking a message that's got power that's held by almighty god there ain't never been anything set out of place by this messenger there's never been anything that's been misdone outside of this messenger because he is in the right hand of almighty god he's there in the very power of god and to think that you're standing behind a vindicated prophet it's an amazing thing when you can sit there and listen to those tapes that's burning your heart when you're listening to and it and knoweth it not and you're sitting there to read likes flashing in this evil age and you think about the god of the seas voyage and satan's eat it and when god goes to choose out a bride and you can sit there and you can say amen to the word of god i'll tell you what a blessed people that you are tonight to recognize that right here right here it may not you may not you may not feel like it tonight and you may be worn out by all the weeks events that's going on in your life things kind of got messed up with your treatments things kind of got messed up with how you went to the doctors and he had a flat tire and you had all kinds of all kinds of chaos that entered into your life this week but setting right shoulder to shoulder with you tonight it's a church of the living god that's got a message that's that that's worth running with we've got the answer we've got the answer and the gates right in front of us and we know that if we'll get to that gate it will run with everything that's within us we've trained for this moment we've trained for this moment we we've done everything that we can to just get right for this moment and you've got the you've got the key in your hand the gates will open unto you hallelujah moving right here in this place tonight i just want i just want you to let your heart loose just for a moment but moving right here in this atmosphere tonight is a supernatural maybe you don't see with your natural eye but i believe that there is a heart of faith that is looking and catches those things and brings it down to them so right here in this atmosphere right here in this atmosphere is the love that you need right here in his atmosphere is a miracle that you need can you say amen right here in this atmosphere is everything that you have need of because jesus christ said that he would be with us now you say well i don't really understand all of that but i'll tell you that the whole armor of god is supernatural is that right so so we recognize that that william branham would come and he would he would lay it out before us that we were sitting here in two worlds and you can see when he would take a patient by the hand or he would begin to discern their heart from setting up here 25 yards away from the patient and he would sit there and he said now now you've seen that light in the papers and you've seen it in the pictures he said that same light is hanging between me and that woman and he said now he said now whatever you have need of he said he'll he'll make known unto you if you'll have just enough faith to believe it and you watch what that pillar of fire would do it would bring out the very secrets of the heart what was he doing he was showing that there was two worlds that that that angel was able to work there in that realm and he was able to call out things in their past and he was able to tell them things out there in their future you see when the vision would go forth you know brother branham he said he said when i seen that vision of that man over there in africa he said he said i could stand there he said i could stand there and he said i knew where i was standing at he said i could challenge all of those skeptics he said i could challenge all the religions of that world he said because i knew where i was standing at what i want to tell you tonight is you ought to know exactly where you're standing at it's because there's a prophet that stood in this day and he didn't say that you're barely going to make it and you're barely going to scrape by but there's a prophet that had a vision break over the church of the living god and she's going to make it with every fiber of her being she's not just going to kneel and make her way there she's going to come running through the gates there's going to be people that don't just live in defeat there's going to be people that live at the victory of almighty god you may not understand and you may not be on the same page as me right now but i want to tell you that before this night is over there's a god that's going to meet your needs you know they don't understand that but there was a lot of people in the message that were sitting there under the ministry of malachi 4 and they walked in one way and they walked out another way it was because there was an angel that they'd been fellowshipping with that same angel is not dead he's alive right now i i don't went too high i ain't coming back down off this i i ain't coming back down i'm not gonna stoop down rare with him hawks and them chickens no more i don't flew up here in the eagle realm i don't flew up here where the anointing of the eagles out and i'm not going back down there to those earthbound chickens i'm not going back down to the denominationalism ideas that we've just confessed it and believe it and accept it and go on but i believe there's a power that's so strong that'll break every stronghold of the devil that's in this place tonight you ain't knocking me off this because it's been revealed to you it's been revealed to me i know exactly where i'm standing at i know where this church is and i know where she's supposed to be living at that's why i can preach to you under the anointing of malachi 4 and you have the ability to go up there and worship like never before there's a lot of people that don't understand your worship there's a lot of people that don't understand your praise but you have broke through the veil [Applause] brother vernon said if i taught you a method his message he said it wouldn't have no effect on you he said if i taught you a lutheran message he said it wouldn't have no effect on you he said because that ain't your message but this is your message he said you fail to see why the people are so enthused and why they're so elated he said they have broke through the veil they have broke through the veil and once you break through the veil there ain't no going back i'm gonna tell you what i've done come out of this thing and i don't seem that back there that life was destroying my life that life was tearing me apart but i broke through the veil and i've seen somebody that was stronger than me that was greater than me i got my eyes on somebody [Applause] this is him brother ma'am brother brown would tell a story he said he said i was sitting there and he said i believe it i believe he was watching it he was watching a documentary on on how that these the these scientists had went down into the midnight dark of that sea there he said he went down all the way down there he said it was complete midnight when they got down there and they turned their lights on and they had fish down there he said just ugly looking fish and you ever you go ever studying studying on those things it it'll scare you half to death you met one of them things you never get an ocean again but you look at you you start studying out those those those creatures that live so far below below that surface they don't need eyes because they can't see down there it's so dark they can't see don't you recognize that where we're living at it's so dark they're blind and they don't even know it but he would say he said they're there he said he said they're using another sense down there he said because there's no way that they could see down there he said so they're using that radar that they have to be able to find their source of food and he said you he said you take that little fish he said that little fish could never come up here to the top of the water he said because it's pressurized to live in the atmosphere where it's living at he said but if you would ever take that little fish he said if you ever take that little fish and he said you bring him up here and let him be me he said you let him be me let him have a human body and think like a human and do like a human he said that little fish you would never want to go back down there under that atmosphere and live like that little fishy in that darkness he said because he said he was pressurized to live there you see what brother branham broke into on the curtain beyond the curtain of time he broke into the sixth dimension he broke up there he broke up there and he said when he got there there was nothing but perfect love there and you remember what they were screaming out to him whatever you do press the battle press the battle he said i could never be the same william branham after that event now let me tell you something what you've been preached to you how could you ever go back to some denominational thinking some cold formal idea when you've been brought up to the message of the hour i can't think the same way i can't drink the same way i can't act the same way i can't talk the same way i've been brought to a level and i'll tell you it's a level where only the elect can live at now when i was when i was a kid i enjoyed the game of baseball i enjoyed it real good about the only thing i was ever good at in athletic room was a little bit of baseball i was too too small to play tackle football that guy so i i just shift sports but now some of you can maybe fellowship with me right here on this thought but when i was little i know brother jeffrey can and brother tj and these other jerry and davey and all these other brothers and don't act like a bunch of saints are sitting there tonight i know you can fellowship with me on it just for a minute but when we was when we was younger they'd have they'd have what they call an opening day you know what i'm talking about and they have that opening day and and they'd have everybody all the teams of the region or the district come out and they'd announce out their name and they'd come out and then they'd have a big event and all the games would be played all the games will be played on that one specific day it was a day that if you're a child and you really looked you really look forward to that day and i remember as i remember as a little boy i remember thinking about thinking about that day you got your brand new you got your brand new uniform on yeah and they didn't give you though they didn't give you those uniforms to practice in they give you those uniforms for opening day they give you they give you that uniform and they've got that they've got the audience there and and the whole the little bitty stadium that we would go down there in grotto's barely had enough barely had enough benches there for anybody the whole family sat there but if you were a fraser boy you're gonna have an attendance and and we look forward to we look forward to that as kids because what they were going to do they were going to announce they were going to announce your name across that audience across that across that atmosphere and they were going to scream out your name and holler out your position and they tell you where where you were playing at what team you were and i'll tell you as a little kid y'all know i was handful but as a little kid i always look forward to that day i always had it in my mind i'd run out there when they call my name i'd run out there and do a back flip and show off you know i never did that because i couldn't do a backflip but i i tell you as a little kid you think about that and they there you are man you are so elated because they've called out your name and there you are you're running out on your field and you they've called out your position here here comes andrew spencer the third the third baseman for for such and such team and you run out there and man your day your name's been called but let me let me i know maybe some of you can't fellowship with me on that fault but i know you can fellowship with me on this all there's been a prophet that stood up in this day and has announced your coming and he said that there would be a bride here that would be without spot and be without wrinkle and i want you to know we don't have to do no backflips in front of the audience but we can tear satan's kingdom down because you and i have been announced that we would be here and if william branham saw me and you here and every devil in hell knows that we're here the bride of jesus christ she's not sitting down but she is on her feet this ain't opening day but it's open season on every devil let's start hunting down some cancer devils let's start hunting down some depression devils i've got a load that i'm ready to shoot at every single one i run into the bride of jesus christ is here [Applause] hallelujah the elect will overcome this age you are the victory of jesus christ you recognize who you are you recognize who you are this word called you brother martin would say that that the first thief she failed he said but this bride cannot fail he said she's ordained not to fail she's predestinated not to fail and we realized that brother branham would come in the feast of trumpets and he would tell us that there's two groups and we realize that we are in the midst of spiritual warfare after the liberty of the saints of god you just stick around you just stick around long enough and you realize that your liberties that you have as an american citizen are being stolen from you left hand and right hand they're stealing away from you in the middle of your night and they're stealing away from you right in front of your eyes how much more did brother branham tell us that there he would break into the feast of trumpets and he would go in there and he pulled out matthew 24 and 24 that in the last days there would be false christs and false prophets that would come unamongst you and do signs and wonders that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible you remember what brother brandon broke in there in revelation chapter nine verse 16 i believe it was that he went in there and those two hundred thousand thousand demons he showed us he said those were supernatural charges supernatural horses and he said there they were in that ecclesiastical power and they were going out there to stomp out the church of the living god brother branham said well we recognize that when those seals were released all of those demons out of the river of euphrates was released at the same time so what you see is those demons are being released to attack the body of jesus christ and you think i i don't know if i'm going to make it or not you're going to make it i'm you're gonna make it if there's a devil that's trying to destroy your life that means that you've got something that he's never handled all hell is after this message every gun of hell is pointed towards you and he don't just want your message he wants your liberty if you could he'd sneak in here and take your worship if he could he'd sneak in here and take away your pastor he'd take away your health he'd take away your joy he'd take away your pride in jesus christ he take away everything that you are he'd take away he take away everything that you are as a believer but you remember what brother branham said there in the feast of trump as i hit on it just a little bit last weekend he said there he said they have bound the spirit of the living god at the door of creeds and dogmas he said but here it is again he said she's coming back to what the bible said and he said she's going to be liberated you think that the very first time throughout all the ages that christ has got a body that he can work through that he can manifest what he said in john 14 12 he can manifest what he said in john 5 and 7 that if you ask anything in my name if you abide in me and my words about and you ask what you will that there ever was a time that we could activate the faith of mark 11 22 god has finally got a body on earth that he can work through a body that he can operate through now now just to turn just for a moment it said that george washington when he was when he was in the battle that he was always outnumbered he was always outnumbered he was always under supplied and he retreated more times than he won he battled through winter when most when most generals when most generals would take that time and they'd go back and spend time with their family but george washington kept on the battlefield we realized that that the supernatural predicted it protected general george washington when they would fire musket bullets shoot through his shoot through his belt and shoot through his arm or shoot through his coat but realize that he went into the battle sometimes outnumbered seven to one brother branham he would preach up he would preach a powerful message on perseverance he called general washington's name that there he would walk across that snowy icy delaware he'd go across there just to win the battle he was perseverant when his men were out there didn't have shoes on their feet in the freezing cold he was perseverant if george washington could be perseverant in that type in that type of condition how much more should you be it said that george or general cornwallis he surrendered only because washington's army kept coming back no matter what the odds as one biographer put it general washington defeated the british and won america's liberty simply because he would not quit now you've heard your pastor stand here and say never never never never give up he's not just challenging your faith he's not just challenging your flesh but he's challenging your faith he's challenged you to step out into the unknown and to believe for the impossible i'll tell you if we can if men could do that in a natural how much more is the church of the living god how do you ought to be able to stand up on your own two feet and stand there and say this is my day this is my hour this is the greatest time that we've ever been living in if william branham would stay if i could have chose any day to live him i chose this day now let me let me just go back to our text just for a moment you remember when ruth when ruth was coming and she begins to make her entrance when she begins to make her entrance into bethlehem it was at the beginning of the barley harvest and when she goes out there in ruth one and she goes out there and she comes to bethlehem and she goes throughout the harvest and she goes throughout she goes throughout ruth deciding to ruth working and and to ruth resting and then to ruth rewarded but there was a process that ruth had to go through and when she went out there and she she went out there and she began to glean off of that field he was in the midst of harvest time and if god ever chose a time to send the bride of jesus christ to the darkest of day he chose to send her in harvest time and when ruth would go out there when ruth would come back and she'd be carrying in the bundles of the wheat that she'd brought in she said blet naomi spoke these words blessed is he that took knowledge of you that took knowledge of thee and she began the bible said that she began to ask who was this one that gave unto her that took knowledge of her and she said one by the name of boaz and i can imagine naomi having herself a jubilee right there when she looked out there in the field and she saw boaz there she said oh this is one of the near kins he is our kids men oh i tell you there's been one that's took knowledge of you in your worst of trials when you didn't feel like serving him when he didn't feel like praising him when you look like you were running out of money when it looked like there wasn't enough space for you there was somebody that took knowledge of you now the bible said in proverbs 3 9 honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses thy presses shall burst out with new wine hallelujah hallelujah think about right now what you've been feeding on this ain't this ain't some old old religion it's new wine that you're feeding on we recognize we recognize i just want to i just want to draw your attention just for a few moments back to leviticus 23 and 10 that it said speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when you come under the land which i give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the sabbath the priests shall wait so when they were brought unto the land that god had already give them the land that was their possession when they were brought there they were to go into that land they were to go in there and sow in that land of that of the harvest and go in there and to expect it to come forth god never sows anything unless he expects it to come forth is that right don't you be weary and you're well doing you'll reap if you don't faint but notice what they were supposed to do they would go there and they were to go in there and sow that seed in the land that god had already give them now i'm taking you into into your possession just for a moment go in there go in there and sow it and when it comes to the time of the harvest when you go in and you get the first fruits you take your first fruits it was the very first one that you planted that had came to maturity you take that first one and you take it before the high priest you take it in there you break it before the high priest and the high priest he would take it and it would be accepted unto him and there the high priest would take that wave offering or he'd take that sheath he'd take that sheath and he would wave it before the lord so that it would be accepted for you so he would wave it before he would wave it to the north he'd wave it to the south he'd wave it to the east and he waved it to the west and when he was doing that it was a sign or a memorial that this was the very first one that it ever came up this was the first one that had came to that had got ripened first and it was in anticipation that there was more that was coming i'm going to tell you what when jesus was standing there and he was preaching to his disciples in john chapter 12 and 23 he said to recognize that the hours come that the son of man should be glorified he said verily verily i say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and it died and abideth alone he said but if it die it'll bring forth much fruit you see you see if you don't plant it you ain't gonna get nothing out of it and if you don't plant your faith in jesus christ you'll never have a harvest of it you say well they say well you have people come to you said brother andrew i prayed i prayed or i've asked i've thought about it i've said these things it seems like i'm not getting anything out of it have you really planted it have you really have you really buried it have you really buried it have you really gave it to god have you really gave your all to god and here here he would that that priest would take it and he'd wave it before the lord he'd wave that first he'd wave that first one out there because he knew that it was a sign or a memorial that there was more coming you remember you remember when jacob and joseph and they come into that land of egypt and he gave them a commission brother adam said in the message the inside he said they knew jacob and joseph knew that there was no first fruits that was of the resurrection he said they wasn't coming out of egypt he said they was coming out of palestine he said he knew that he said so he said you take my bones you don't bury him down here he said if you bury my bones down here he said they'll stay right here he said but if you'll take my bones up there and you'll bury them up there in palestine there's coming a resurrection up there and i think when that quickening power had found the body that he could live him moses had a portion of it david had a portion of it but when it anchored in the womb of mary and it produced to jesus that same quickening power that was there in the very beginning that spoke in the beginning let there be light and there was light that same quickening power was now living and manifesting in the body of jesus christ and what was he what was he he was the first fruits of them that had slipped of those that had went down in faith living for jesus christ just like abraham was there just like isaac was there just like jacob was there there when jesus christ rose up not he didn't raise up but he would but when he rose up on the third day he didn't just go up alone he brought all those old testament saints with him you start studying out the message you start studying out the old testament and when job is out there and he's looking he's looking out there in the land he's looking out there and he sees the trees he sees them fall away and he sees them come back to life the very next season he watches the flowers how they pass away and he recognizes they can come back to life again but he had a question before god he said if a man die shall he live again i fell you know i found an amazing i find it amazing that william branham would he come here and he what'd he do as his first bible he'd watch nature he'd watch nature there job was looking at that nature he said i see this die and i see it come back to life again but if a man dies shall he live again and brother adam said one day he was out there fellowshipping on that thought if a man dies shall he live again he said then a vision broke forth a vision broke forth and he began to see the light and the lightnings roared the lightness flashed and the thunders roared and he said there he began to see that there was a man that was coming to bridge the gap that a man if he died would live again brother branham said that in in the message of god recognizing your day and its message he said job recognize what the resurrection was it was jesus it was the same jesus that was there that was working in those flowers and bringing them back to life again because he is the author and the finisher of our faith and i tell you tonight your faith ain't in vain if you're believing on the lord jesus christ your faith ain't in vain if you if you lost a loved one and it done went by the way of the grave he's gave you a promise that those that are dead in christ shall he raise first but we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet him in the twinkling of an eye paul would say in first corinthians 15 he said but if in this life we have hope only we have hope in christ he said if in this life only we have hope in christ he said we are all of men most miserable he said but now is christ risen from the dead and became the first fruits of them that slept he said for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead he said for as for as in all for as in adam all die he said but even so in christ shall all be made alive he said but every man in his own order christ the first fruits afterwards they that are christ at his covenant and to think that tonight brother i heard brother branham say it today he said he said those disciples he said i hear people say i wish i could be back there with those disciples and that day gone by he said but you don't need to long for that day to live back there with the days of the disciples he said that same quickening power that was in those disciples he's in the church he's in you i don't think you ain't got a wish for days gone by but that same power that raised jesus christ from the dead is living right here i'll tell you it's gonna raise our mortal bodies about of this ground but to think that here jesus christ was the first one up it been a lot of people die buddha's got a great religion but it'll never get you out of the grief muhammad's got a great theology but it never gets you out of the grave there was a lot of men that told and had a lot of philosophy there was a lot of men that had said a lot of great things had a lot of had a lot of constructive criticism had a lot of things that would maybe pump you up but there's ever been one man that ever got up from the grave and he stood there and he said he said you destroy this body and i'll raise it up again he said i have power to raise it up you put it in a grave i raise it up he said you spent 46 years building this temple but in three days i'll raise it back up again there they were thinking of that temple but he was speaking of this temple but what was it when he got up on easter morning it was the first fruit that if i rise they'll rise hallelujah if i can do it they can do it and brother branham said that he was waved over the people up there on that day of pentecost hallelujah he was waved over those people up there they were up there praising god praising god for something that they had not had yet brother branham said they were up there waiting on pro on job's prophecy to come to pass and he said when they got it they knew they had it you might be sitting there saying well i don't really know i know that i'm here i know that i'm in the message i know i know i'm under a great ministry i know i know that we're here but you have not really recognized and you've not really experienced the power of jesus christ it's for you it's for you if you've not experienced the liberty that comes with this message you need to dive in one good time and i don't i don't believe that i don't believe has messaged people or message churches that we're trying to get people to ourselves but we're trying to get them to jesus christ there ain't no resurrection power in the name of william branham there ain't no resurrection power in the holy pope's name there ain't no resurrection power in homer fraser's name or tim pruitt's name or ron spencer's name but there is resurrection power in the name of the most high god his name it's not a weak name it's a strong name and his name is the only name where men should be saved but by the name of jesus christ there is coming a time when every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess and to think that same one that rose up on easter morning when he broke out of the grave brother branham said they only seen him he said but it was a whole gang of old testament saints with him he started rising up on through the ascent and david broke into it and said he led captivity captive he said psalms 24 he said lift up your heads all your gates and be lift up your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is that king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads all your gates and even lift them up all you everlasting noise and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory shalom i can hear william branham say he said there was two angels up there in heaven he said they were up there strumming and playing their music and they came down they come down to heaven they come down the earth so fast they said why are your heart why are you so weary or why are you so distressed there he went and there he went rising up he said he passed the moon and the stars of fast he went by with the old testament saints and he said the angel pushed the button and the doors come flinging wide open and there the king of glory walked in and god said you sat down here you sit down here while i make the rest of your enemies that footstool you tell your enemy he ain't nothing but a footstool for jesus christ he's been attacking you all day been attacking you all week telling you you're not gonna make it he ain't nothing but a footstool for my god he says you won't overcome he says you won't have the baptism of the holy ghost he says days of miracles has gone by but he don't know what he's talking about he's just a footstool it's just a footstool for our lord and this is the bride coming of jesus christ every if you ain't got your i believe it's timothy pruitt that tells us he said if you ain't got your foot on satan's neck you are out of your place satan is out of his place if he ain't under your feet i'll tell you it's a great place to have him he's underneath for your feet so that everything he looks up his seat is miss jesus christ if the head rolls up the body's got to get up too he said he was waved up waved over those people up there in pentecost he said they was up there at that pentecost he said they was waiting for that blessing to come you think there they were a bunch of cowards but when the waves he began to he waved over them because i live you live also and that same power was living on the inside of peter got so much on the inside of him that he preached the 15-minute sermon on the day of pentecost preached the 15-minute sermon up there on the day of pentecost and he told them and they they begin to be pricked in their hearts when they begin to make fun of him at the very beginning of his sermon they began to mock him and make fun of him but the end of his sermon they said men and brethren what shall we do and he told him repent and be baptized every one of you is that right and there peter when he was walking when he would walk people would have enough faith that if that same power that raised christ up was living on the inside of peter he said that brother adam would say or the scriptures tell us that those people had so much faith that if peter would walk down the street and his shadow would be cast out over top of those people that were sick and lame or in distress or those things that the very shadow of peter the very shadow of peter cross across to them and they'd be completely made whole that same power that was in peter has been restored to the church of the living god notice what william branham said he said and it is to be waved again in this last day according to luke 17 30 and the day of the sun and then in the sunday again in the day that the s-o-n of man will be revealed or waived over again the people in this day he said the very same one he said when you see those things you think he said when when you go to looking at it that it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the day of the sabbath but it was the very first day and he said he said that sunday he said son he said they've made it into a roman name he said but this is the s-o-n day again this is when the sun has risen again he said that's why it is a rising of the sun it's a dual sunrise goodness and here we are we've got we've got malachi 4. and brother adam said that malachi 4 will be waved over the people and luke 17 30 that in the last days the son of man will be revealed in the last days he said it is to be waved over the people again and they're dead traditions a man is dead and the son of god is alive again with the baptism of the holy ghost of spirit right amongst them and given us life i tell you we're living an hour when it's so close that it would receive the very elect if it was possible brother burnham he said you could take two cars he said you could set them down the same assembly line send them down the same assembly line he said they could come down have the same color have the same engine have everything exactly right have the hubs right be all polished out exactly right coming off the same line both of them have gasoline he said but if one of man got the spark in it he said it'll show you he said unless it's got the spark in it he said it might that gasoline might as well be water you see you see pentecost can get so close but they've missed it they are missing the very fire power of the holy ghost i'll tell you i'll tell you it's an awesome day to recognize and william branham said there'll have to be another chief wave than that's the last day he said a waving of that sheep he said what was that sheath he was the very first one that came to maturity the first one that proved it was wheat that proved it was a sheath he said hallelujah he said i'm sure you see what i'm talking about he said it was waved over the people and the first time they'll ever come forth for the bride age for the resurrection out of the dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and the same wonders that he did back there and you think what's been waived over this generation and they're guilty for turning down the son of man again and you think about the one that was waved over this bride of jesus christ when you look at the ministry that was waved over no wonder no wonder that ministry could stand there when which doctors would be standing there in germany and they'd called for a storm to try to shut down the meeting out there he said they were standing out there chanting all those things but william branham said that he stood there and he just called for that storm to go back to its place where it came from and they sat there and had healing after healing miracle after miracle it's this wave sheath that's been waved over the bride of jesus christ if hattie right for that could ask for two boys how much more can you ask if william branham could stand there under the same anointing that's here right now and he could speak to that storm out there in colorado if he could speak to if he could speak to that tumor and sister media how much more could you and i take the same authority of the word that's been waived over this generation and we could call cancer to leave a body we could cause sickness to leave a body called suppression to leave our mind anxiety to leave our mind how much more if that same one's been waved over the church of the living god i'm preaching to you the most powerful thing that there is it's the message of the hour and this message that you've been given it don't have no restraints on it every restraint's been pulled off of it brother burnham said there's been churches churches bride's brides but there's got to come one that's both mechanics and dynamics she's here i tell you i believe i believe it so much that i believe that if you could say the right thing you could say the right thing when the one that's been waved over this generation you could say the right word and you watch your sons walk in this building i believe you could say the right word and you watch cancer leave i believe you could say the right word and they'd be a pouring out of the baptism of the holy ghost i believe you could be able to just say amen to the word of god and you watch the most mighty miracles that be done in this generation right here tonight how could he wave that before them and sent them out amongst a generation of wolves because it was his power it was his anointing it was his life it's his church and to think that where you are that's what's being waived over you this ain't another god it's the same god william branham could stand there and say i'd recognize there'd be a little resurrection to a little bitty fishy i see the resurrection coming he said there that little fish had been laying there all those hours and there comes something whirling out of that trees come whirling out of that mountain stand up and call for resurrection to come to that little fish another baron said i had all of those cases sitting out there in that wilderness sitting out there in the cities he said i had an epileptic sitting out there i had diseases sitting out there he said but god wanted to show that he was god over the little things as much as he was over god are the big things you're serving a god a variety and you're serving a god that has no limits on him and there's too many people that are trying to steal the very liberty of this message away from you and tell you that it's too late i tell you that days are going by i tell you it's just for preachers or it's just for this one or it's just for those that study 24 hours a day what kind of nonsense is that what kind of nonsense is that if he could so come and feel what we would call the mary the mother of jesus christ if he would come and touch the mary magdalene if he would come and raise lazarus from the grave if he would come to the what we would seem insignificant people if he would come to a little lady that only made twenty dollars a year he knows where you're living at and he knows what you're going to ask don't you be afraid to ask big things of god ask that your joy might be full i want to take you down just a line just for a moment who was it that raised ron spencer out of a coma when you thought that you were getting ready to lose your pastor when you thought

was that one that walked in there when doctors had given him up when doctors said he'd been brained in for 36 hours i tell you the odds were stacked up against him i tell you it's the same one that abraham was fellowshipping with who was that one that called for doug's life doug hill's life to come back to him i tell you it's the same one that abraham was fellowshipping with who is that one that brought lord signs back into the church of the living god it's the same one that abraham was fellowshipping with who was the same one that brought stephen bowers and tara bars to the greatest message that's ever sounded out i'll tell you it's the same one that melchizedek that abraham was fellowshipping with who's going to be the one to get your boy out of trouble it'd be the same one you've been fellowshipping with who's going to set these young girls free it's the same one that we've been fellowshipping with who's going to take care of all of your problems who's going to drive cancer out who's going to drive sugar diabetes out who's going to do it it'll be the same one that william branham met up there in a cave it's this jesus christ if i can do it they can do it if i create it on the first day if i created all generations they can create they can call for life they can call if moses could stand there he could roll his shoulders back and he could call for fleas and he could call for flies call for frogs and call for hell setting out there under the blood of bulls and goats what are you doing crying what are you doing crying speak and go forward this message is the final voice of the final age it's time to sound off it's time to start coming into speaking conditions with him what he's deposited on the inside of you is for you luther wished he looked for a day like

come up here to where you are and god will give them grace for where they're living at and you decide i'm just going to put this over on the shelf and i'm going to listen i'm just going to listen i'm going to stay at my house and i'm going to listen to tapes and i decide i'm not going to church no more you'll be guilty for turning down the one that's been waived over you this ain't the time to put this message on the shelf it's a time to bring it out live it out breathe it out speak it out i got family members that i know it's way too impossible for them to get in this building by bystanders but by his standards you know what i'm talking about sister francis you know what i'm talking about by my standards or by your standards or by our ideas it's way too hard for them to work through the message they got to get to to get here but if god got you here brother joel if god got you here he'll take care of your house problems he'll take care of your situations he's that kind of god that he cares about the small things and he cares about the big things [Applause] i'll tell you they they might look like you the hust might look like the wheat but it ain't got the reals they ain't got the
