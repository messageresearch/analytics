amen and I was thinking about it and I said you know my mom she'd been gone for about three years now and you know we went through basically our churches just went totally just just it just flat bottom down flat line that you know people were worried about the church being stands going and staying moving and just go on moving you know and you look at and you said God has a purpose behind it

miracle is we're still going hey man we're still going hey buddy we looking at and I said you know I got to thinking about the miracles in my life and I got to looking at the miracles it goes on around here and I seen God moving Claude has not changed his mind about his word if he healed one he'll heal again they better be saved one he'll save again if you fill one with the whole ago he'll fill another with the whole ago you just have to be willing to receive it into your life man let's get ourselves out of the way and let God move down by his spirit down upon our lives a man and I looked at it and I see I seen the church moving and I see people it was a million night brother if we came in and there was only two there but we had to and we lead up on that Scripture a lot and we leaned upon brother Brandon said we're two or three gathered in my name who would be in the mist Jesus Christ would be in the mist and when he's in the minister's nothing that can hold it back a man and I looked at that scripture we continue to rehearse that scripture we didn't have no musicians and I said my goodness I said we need some musicians and oh you know there's things that you need you need rhythm you need that hey man you need you need somebody that's not afraid to be in front of a congregation like me and Masey you're you're nervous when you get up early afraid she gonna mess up

but we was continuing to hold her up in prayer we looked at God to be the answer and you know you can listen to the the line bandidas of what goes on now doctor will tell you what he's seen it because he's sinned by the reaction of your body is reacting to what's going on inside your body a man and I seen God moving and I seen it we went down there to the the head doctors and we was looking at him

Fraser with he he would come he would give it to you hey man he gave it to you all the way through and it seen him part of my sermon I'm just enjoying it that man that man hey man mmm my momma read a story from the Bible long ago about Shadrach Meshach and older bedico and how the wicked King command they be thrown into the plain because they would not bow [Music] I [Music] then I said wait a minute there's one thing that I love chicken Wow [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] myself amen cuz he's the one I serve he's the one I lift up man we're looking at 2nd Corinthians 5 don't leave me drunk up here 2nd Corinthians 5 starting at verse 1 everybody ready amen but we know if I hurt birth Lee House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for if this in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall be found not be found naked for we that are also in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that which we we being unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life now he that hath brought a good good brought us for his self saying thing is God who hath also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit therefore we have all always are always confident knowing that while as we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord for we walk by faith and not by sight we are confident I say and willing to be absent from this body and to be present with the Lord wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him for we almost before appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in this body according to that he had done whether it be good or bad may the Lord at his blessings to his word tonight in mind and just asking you to be seated tonight if you can hey mind them and we're looking at it and we're seeing this and you know we look at this this earthly body groaneth for more than what we have right now you know as I was saying we we kind of wake up every morning as we get older younger people don't they you're learning they're jumping up and they're ready to go but we get older we wake up with one of the brothers one of the itis brothers a man and we we look at that we see that you know we got things hurting that didn't hurt yesterday you know but you look at you say well the groundhog didn't deliver the mail so I'm still here so we look at it we see God has given us or blessed us with another day blessings is not all the way in how much you have much money you have in your pocket I mean the blesses of God can come in a way that you don't need money to live a man he said he would supply your need all the time a man and we look at that but what we have to do is look beyond this vale of tears and then in looking to Jesus a man and he said brother Branham says it like it's right here said going away Jesus and I want you to look at this right tonight I want to say we're going beyond our own thinking a man what's that mean tonight to me that means that when we get to the end of our road that means you got to go a little further and man you got to look beyond your veil of Tears and you got to look beyond and see Jesus Christ on the other side because when you do that you realize you're getting this person out of the way I mean you're getting this person out of the way good to see you Hey hey man scared me to death one day come walking up to me down there in Gatlinburg don't go to Gatlinburg cause everybody knows everybody down there you man well hey man he said you'll recognize me when we get back up and I was like glory to God I said this is all right there man being compassed about with such a great a cloud of witnesses hey man that's what we want to do is live for Christ every day no matter whether you're in church or whether you there in the world you'd be a lighthouse for Jesus Christ a man be a representative of Jesus Christ amen amen the message of the hour is more important than feeling good out there amen you need to live the Word of God amen this is free tonight amen because we've been raised in church we've been brought up to it Amen we still getting ready to talk about the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego why did they have such a feeling inside their life that they knew not to bow down before that guy they met before that image amen it was because of the reason that they had it made you parents you've got a you got a responsibility to raise those children and it's still in their minds they need Jesus Christ more than anything this world can give them amen don't bow down to anything amen you live the message of the hour it man because one day it's gonna be up to us to stand there ready and truly meant to be the bride of Jesus Christ amen they men we see that in brother Brown says it right here like this right here go away Jesus I am no more Ramon thinking I ain't gonna think like I think Lord I'm just going to think like you would think and you promised that when I was that I was healed and I think that I surrender my thinking I want no more think about my sicknesses I won't think about the disease I had I ain't thinking about nothing but thinking about what you said hey man what'd he say he said now right in front of you stay is the person that was just like you a few minutes ago you were sitting down but there is a well person standing there Jesus Christ is calling out to that well person right beyond it now you just have to have faith so close your eyes walk right into that well body and then you just keep right on a walk and hey man get it into your mind go beyond your own thinking Amen don't sit there and go whether this happened to this person or this happened to this person you know anybody you mash your toe well I've heard people dying from that you know I know you just look at it because somebody negative that's always gonna be around you I mean there's a lot of people that like the water on your fire and then they want to push you out oh whoops they go with it what they doing they trying to kill your face hey man but you've got to stand on your own two feet yeah oh god they are going to be there they go to people all around you all the time they gonna be looking at you saying well this is you yes what's gonna happen to you what happens you go I'm gonna rise above that and then I'm gonna rise above that evil that you're speaking about and I'm going to lean upon the word of God because I know this word lives and then it lives a man it lives within me a man the word was made flesh and lives within this body a man and you make it become so real that you even be go go beyond what this flesh thing say man there's two people here they mean you got a body that you live in it feels pain it sees the darkness of this world and Men but you also look at it inside of there there's Jesus Christ and you're so low a man and it looks beyond what even your flesh can think I don't care I'm gonna walk right on up and then I'm gonna keep moving right on up I mean you could die out just because y'all have seen people that'll just lay there and then that d-nev is sick you know I think you worked on when I'm a man you working for one I'm with her with the chimney sweeping and he what he did he retired and quit and laid down had a well body well body well bye I said I'm done but you know what in a few short days he couldn't move he found there having to feed him and take care of him if you don't move this body it will die if you don't move this word it'll die within you you need to make this word living you how do you make it live you eat it up you start reading it earnestly I'm contended that one day on this mortal I will live a mortal a man with this corruptible that comes on man - you ain't got nothing on me mmm but I have Jesus Christ on the inside that I have a new body coming to me you may be 83 you may be 86 you may be no ID you may be a hundred but it ain't nothing when you talk about eternity and an eternity with Jesus cry and then that's what I'm looking for life here is but a vapor get yourself ready so when that hour comes I mean you don't have to look around you can say I'm standing steadfast on the rock of Jesus cry amen the devil may come up against me but I know who's gonna win I know who's gonna win tonight a man that's Jesus cry he felt that battle he got himself Lord everything he had and put it into Jesus cry and meant that he could take all your sins he could take all your sicknesses he could take every thought that you have inside of your mind and he could take that and he can load it he could take that back to hell that you could live for him not just waiting on something but Jesus Christ himself also give you his life and then he gave you his life that when that battle comes you don't lean up on this flesh you lean upon what's on the inside that's Jesus Christ maybe he starts speaking to you and man as I heard the news about brother Ron I immediately went to prayer I went to thinking about those dark roads I mean I get to think about that but I said I know one it can lighten that path Amen I know one it can be there lighten that path and then I found myself in tears I praises to God a man that I know someone that can heal a man I don't have to lean up on this flesh saying this is going to happen I can lean up on the Bible and say this is what's gonna happen ever I thank God for that tonight give him glory tonight give him glory to your name and then we sing about him we're gonna talk about him here Amen but look I don't want to look at something right here Saint Peter puts it like this right here and then when I got I called that up and I said you ready to go with me down down there what's wrong he goes yep I saw him last you do something I said I want you to put on your floor we're going to battle we're going to battle don't come to a battle if you ain't got your shield on don't come to a battle if you ain't got your breastplate a face on hey man don't come to a battle if you're not ready remember when you step in front of them a man that David when he walked out to hurry man he looked at and he said he was just too big to miss hey man they talked about how big he was he was too big to miss hey man I'll look at that same way I'm gonna hit that devil right between the eyes tonight ever because I put on the whole armor what are you saying I say it like just right here and played you were listed Ephesians they meant finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his my putting on the whole armour of God that she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil but we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against the principalities against the powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual weakness in high places were four taken to you the whole armour of God that you may be able to understand in that evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about you with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all take it on the shield of faith wherewith you'll be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked a man may guqin quits those hurried art and when they come up against you you can look them straight in the eye and say greater is He that's within me that he's within you and that Jesus Christ is only inside a man and if you don't have him tonight find that peace a man because the world is coming to an end so quickly and then time is spritz whipping by I've seen a Doomsday Clock is already out to 12 o'clock where we at tonight are we ready to go find yourself seeking more of Jesus Christ amen that God if he'd heal you tonight and then if he touches your body completely amen who knows tomorrow it may be your day to go home remember we see this we need to be ready for eternal walk with Jesus Christ not just a temporal one I feel better today I feel better than I did yesterday we need to know that if I should be gone tomorrow I will be in the presence of Jesus Christ a man that we need to know that my next step may be on those streets a man that I may be with my other ones that are looking over the balcony saying keep on the good work keep fighting the battle and man they're praying that you can stand the battle because they know there are fiery darts of the devil were upon you and you and you in each one of you can say they're up on us tonight but we need to be ready and I we need to be ready tonight a man there man we're looking at three Hebrew children we see them back in the Book of Daniel a man we see then we see a God talking about you know you say well well well they they got written down because they did something good no they got written down because they stood the test they stood the test they didn't back up they didn't go down on their knees a man we read scriptures all the time you know you could rehearse the Bible over and over again and what do they put in there is for you when you come up against that time when you're in fire you come up against the wall and you pray and it'll fall and then you're looking to these circumstances in life and what do you do you take it back to the word make it live inside of you and man we see them Nebuchadnezzar there he is he's looking at them he said there doesn't be little runts I mean there's nothing but these little kids it's up here and they wasn't old people they wasn't ready to die they were downer they knew what they were down there for a man they knew that that God was with them and they do the God of Abraham and know and they knew all of them and up but here they were standing there a man they didn't bow down they need him pay attention to him brother and said they was just right actually just praying one to another and you know you see that and you see it here and let's look at Daniel let's see Daniel what they're doing here it just for a moment just to recapture a man here he had called in Daniel had told to told the dream and the Nebuchadnezzar built up a huge image of him out there and he wanted he gathered in just not regular people he gathered in two great people he gathered in people that would influence huge if you didn't have the holy ghost inside idea that would make you think well they're better you know you look at that and you see that moving they're going on you know and you see all those influential people you know we've seen them the last few weeks in this impeachment trial amen you know I looked at that I said you know what I accomplished more than Congress did today and I said well there you go but you look at it what is that doing that's taking the eyes off of what you should be looking at and should be getting more into with the Word of God because there's going to be wars and rumors of wars and then shaking there's gonna be more earthquakes is going to be waves I mean well I heard that song ways overflowing and you know we never even thought about now tsunami has become a normal word think about it just a few short years ago tsunami was not even hardly known and now all of a sudden it's just a common word Jamaica has a seven point seven and you know a seven point seven it's down there what has happened it is it is seared our very thinking that this world is groaning looking for the soon return of Jesus Christ and it is looking to be made over why shouldn't we as Christians be looking to be made over her back be made into a new creation that one day will step from this in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to be called up and called away to be with Jesus amen and we look at this we see them near here they are they're coming down to their test a man and many have me ever faced the test hey Matt I have faced some tests a man we go through those tests and trials you know a test in school is to see what you learned in the past I have to be honest with you when I was in school most the time when they go mark what's the answer to that question I don't remember nothing I remember nothing there is nothing in this though pea-brain that I have that would even finitely think about what she was trying to say and miss Turner she was like wrong never like that mrs. wimbur was about this tall which she said you're never going to be like Ryan well I tell you what I may not be like him but we sure do have a lot of the same thoughts you said around long enough and he'll go I was just thinking that you know because that's way we are we're brothers we're brothers and sisters in Christ we don't have to worry about what each other's thinking cuz we're thinking about what God is getting ready to do for us a man and I look at these three little Hebrew children they're standing there they knew where they stood at they knew where they stood at and they were standing there and said no Nebuchadnezzar says bow down bow down I'm gonna toot the floor horns and I'm gonna play the harp someone to do all this stuff and go get all the music going and I want you to bow down and everybody in one Accord to be the big wigs and all them they started bowing down but there was three that didn't three them didn't you know somebody must have been not bowing completely because they said they ain't somebody wasn't completely fulfilling their needs of bowing down before their God but there was three that wasn't gonna bow before that car but they do praise the God hear my hand and we looked at it when we see them standing there and they're like he kindly comes over there he looks at the manipulation looked at and he said therefore because the Kings Commandments was urgent and the furnace was exceedingly hot and the flame of fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and Abednego we see them standing there he had gotten so mad that he heated it up seven times brother Brown said he had to take them back and put them back and let them stand so they could get that fire heated up hey man that's what the devil wants to do to you he wants to get that fire you made a well I survived that and I survived that but he next time he's coming by with our more heated fire and he's coming by with something bigger him the Goliath get bigger in her lives amen but he just gives you the same stone that's called the Word of God amen he don't have to change you know had to get bigger it's the Word of God is living on the inside a man his brother Rob was talking about seeing over here all right he's taking that thing and he was whooping it around like this right here that's what he's doing he's getting that word wound up to go hit that devil hey man to go get that devil why should we change now God has not changed a man and we see them standing there we look at him and matter brother Branham says elections right here he said they said now those Hebrew children I can notice them they were praying they didn't pray paying attention to that King they didn't fear his command they they wanted to know what thus saith the Lord and they turned their faces and prayed just the same just closely now all right to this decree was made then the King put his seal up on there he must keep it he was going to burn these three Hebrews I could hear Nebuchadnezzar will teach them holy rollers what to do around here we'll show them who's boss that's what a lot of Devils like to do a man a man I don't know I hope it's okay to say this they call it a call it kalfus and Nachman down there when you wreck you know they you say call kalfus and Nachman and they'll they'll have the other lawyers on they're going to they've heard kalfus and Nachman we better leave them alone give them whatever they want no it's time for us because that what that Devils going to do he's going to go I'm from the devil and his angels and I know what's going on I owned you since you were born you remember those good old times we had together he will remind you of everything you've done wrong and he loves fishing he loves fishing in your mind he loves playing with your mind and he's sitting there going and we got you there's no way you could get out of this and all of a sudden you start realizing wait a minute I remember a day when I'm now down at an altar that was a knock came upon my door a harsh door he says whosoever shall open that door I shall come in and sup with him and I looked back and I said when I open that door Jesus come walking in he come walking into me and he changed me Oh devil and you're Satan and then you have no power over me Jesus Christ is walking within me amen and when I opened that door he closed it he put a little self of him in there man he put a little something in her that will stand up no matter what the devil says amen amen it says faith as a mustard seed a mustard seed is so small you can barely see it but you put it under concrete that booger will come up and then he will come crawling up out of there and you'll fight over every power that's trying to hold him down you too can fight over every Power if you have faith in Jesus Christ you have faith to believe you can receive and may give him glory to God and may give him low rent lifted up his name

to the end of the road and then we look at them you can see them you know those ones that come to the end of the road they know when they ready to go they know when they're ready to go a man I went to see a man they called me over there to the to the the hospital and it was like four o'clock in the morning he said this man is screaming he's ready to die and he just he just don't know what to do said can you come pray with him so I went over and talked to him I went in there sitting and trying to figure out what was going on he was awful and laughs it took its toll on him he wasn't a Christian he said but I've always I've always heard about Christians and I said well I said God still heals if you still got a breath in your life we can go through this and we can talk and he was just irate he said I pity you going in there and talk to him I know you don't have any men so I went on in there and I sitting there I was like Lord what do I do and so I just took some scriptures and you know winning there you know you kind of got your background but you know you knew you need to know where you're standing even without a Bible you need to know where you're standing even without a Bible everybody you need to know that your foot is on the rock of Jesus Christ amen because you're going in there and you're gonna fight some Devils at this thing they say I ain't letting him go I had him his whole life and I stuck continue to talk to him I said you know I said you know just going through the scriptures and relaying it back and forth to him and and he goes well I wanna I wanna heaven I said what do you have her surrending horn he said yes and I told him I said walking through who Jesus was and he said yeah I know who was my mom talked about him you know and I think back to brother Branham he said that he said you know you raise a child up the way it should go you teach him about Jesus Christ that coming to church they will not stray from it that was what was going on with him because he is tormented within his own mind because he knew there was another place coming and he wasn't ready or prepared to go to there we sat there and prayed for all about 45 minutes of back-and-forth talking and praying and I kept watching him turning and he kept turning and so I said well are you okay and he goes I feel much better than I have in a while he said I appreciate it and I said well I said you know I said we will continue to pray for you I put his name in my Bible here they said from that moment until he died he was at peace the entire time he treated those nurses with the utmost respect he did what he could what was it there was a change come inside of his life that he knew that his heart was ready to go and then we need to find that peace within our own selves tonight a man that if we get faced with that trial and we're gonna cast you into that fire a man that you're ready to go a man and that's what we're looking for tonight is getting ready to go into that fire and we look at that we see them and they're all looking at each other and they're praying what are they doing brother brown tape typifies it out when they're coming up through their own Shadrach he's walking up these and his hands are bound and they're taking it to the heated fire a man and he's coming out he said what'd you do I prayed all night long I prayed what'd you find out I'm ready to go I'm gonna meet him one way or the other I'm gonna meet a man I'm gonna meet him in that fiery man and they continued to walk up through there and they're looking at each other and he said I got everything I don't have nothing to look back for he said I am ready to go I know exactly where I stand at I stand up on the word a man and they continue to walk up through there and as each one of them you kind of look around and you see all those big soldiers that was going to prayer will take you at birth what's the devil gonna do try to keep you right at the very end and try to hit you to turn back and I don't you turn your back on the message of the hour don't you turn your back on God I'm telling you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do not turn your back upon this word this is the message of the hour no I had his message no I had his message get on the boat or drown a man I have this get in the message of the hour brother branham's message and find yourself find yourself enveloped with the Word of God amen that you will not be called in that hour and then I'm not knowing who you are no Jesus Christ personally amen and here they are they're walking about through there they got their swords and they're poking them as they're going on up through there and they're working in all of a sudden one he's like falling off to the side he said you mean to hold you up I was

king down old Nebuchadnezzar knew he said I want to get him into the fire I'm gonna show him who's boss I'm gonna show him that my God is greater than their guard I'm gonna teach them not to bow down before them when I tell them the bow they'll bow the next time I'll show the world I'll show them and what do they do they continue to march on up through there and I'm here to say that they said many of them and died before the evening that fire was so hot it burned them up and I looked at it and I said you know what who's to say that everyone I'm didn't go up in there we sometimes have to go in the fire by ourselves we don't need nobody pushes it's like were you ready I am ready to go hey man and they hopped up into her amen it down in that fire but when they hit that floor they hit it running and then why there he was let's check the camera back just a little bit let's turn it back toward heaven a little bit and they're looking and they're stepping off in there as they're falling

all the pain he felt all the agony of those nails being droving into his hand and then he felt that a man God had stood to her and he watched his son die right there on that brawl say man and we looked at me with these three boys go walking up through her and man as they stepped off into that fire and Manny said what you gonna do let me go down they were going through it you know and glut

it was dancing time hey man yeah man it was dancin time and then we let God move it will be dancing time for the bride of Jesus cried a man that we can praise his name and lift up his name and glorify His name because Jesus Christ is in the fire with you and he's in there with you and he'll fight every battle but you have to be willing to let him go you had to go beyond your own thinking I don't know what God has in store for me but whatever it is it's in that fire it's in that fire that I've got to go amen you wouldn't have heard about it if they'd have been well they stopped at the end God saved him and he turned back no they had to go all the way here they had to go all the way in if I'd have stopped and turned back there went a bit no story told about the story made when the King looked over in an unbeliever looked over there in Elkton and said looky there look that's the bride of Jesus Christ I've heard him talking about that and they're still going even in this dark and perverse generation they're still going and living the life and being a lighthouse for Jesus Christ and then they're still in if I what is it Jesus Christ it's in that battle for you you just lean upon him amen let Jesus Christ be your mate waymaker and man and man the devil said I've got him amen but jesus said I had them I had them in my hand they're sheltered in my arms amen even though the world be falling apart out there we're cliffed in that rock that rock up or it may be falling apart amen but we're cliffed in the breastplate of him a man letting Jesus just hold us during those times amen because many times we want to go like I do this I got to do this what we need to do is stand still and know that I am THE LORD thy God and that stand still and know that I am THE LORD thy God amen brother Branham enclosing brother Branham says it like this right here he says lookie here he said at your darkest hour when you think there's no hope to be there for you ever again you think that all is lost Jesus comes on the scene man he comes on the scene that's who I want to come on the scene tonight and man you uplifted those hands earlier you said I need something from Christ and
