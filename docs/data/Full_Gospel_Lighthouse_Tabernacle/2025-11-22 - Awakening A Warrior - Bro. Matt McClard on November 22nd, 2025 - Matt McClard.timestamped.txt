[31:23] [music] us from all sin. And Lord,
[31:25] there's been a way made, Lord, that you
[31:27] sent a word, oh God, in this end time, a
[31:29] message to call a [music] people out,
[31:31] Lord, and and to prepare her for the
[31:33] rapture, Lord. Thank you, Jesus, Lord,
[31:36] that [music] Lord, that you, excuse me,
[31:38] that you counted us worthy, oh God, to
[31:39] escape the tribulation.
[31:42] We'll be in heaven with you, Father God,
[31:43] Lord, while the tribulation goes on.
[31:46] Lord, then you will come and rule and
[31:47] reign with you for a thousand years of
[31:49] peace, Lord. What a time that's going to
[31:51] be, [music] Lord. And it's all because

[32:09] every person, Lord, and every need that
[32:11] they have in their lives. Lord, every
[32:13] request that was read, Father, Lord, you
[32:15] know the intricate details, Lord, and
[32:17] all [music] the pain and all the tears,
[32:19] Lord, of every trial that they go
[32:20] through, that we all go through, Lord,
[32:23] you're truly a good shepherd, Lord.
[32:25] You're with us in every step of the way,
[32:27] Lord. And we just thank you, Father, for
[32:28] that. Thank you for being so mindful
[32:30] [music] and for caring so much. And we
[32:32] just commit all these requests into your
[32:34] hands, Lord. And know that, Lord, you're
[32:36] able to do abundantly, Lord, than we can
[32:38] even ask or do or think. We just worship

[32:42] sister Wanda to you, Lord. And when she
[32:43] goes through them scans, Lord, may they
[32:46] just, Father God, Lord, just be right
[32:47] where [music] our faith is that she's
[32:48] cancer free. We just love you, Lord, and
[32:51] thank you for bringing her, Lord,
[32:52] through this trial, we just pray for all
[32:54] the other ones fighting cancer. Our
[32:55] brother Ron, Lord, and Brother Jeffrey

[32:59] just be mindful, Lord, and just
[33:00] strengthen them, Lord. Sister Delaney,
[33:02] [music] continue to strengthen them,
[33:04] Lord. And just, Lord, may you just be
[33:05] there each and every day as you promise
[33:07] that you'd never leave us or forsake us.
[33:09] for all the other requests and every
[33:11] hand that was raised. Be with each need,
[33:13] Lord. Bless each life. Lord, bless
[33:15] [music] the word this evening as it
[33:17] comes forth. Lord, I pray that you bless
[33:18] Brother Matthew. Father, bless them,
[33:20] Lord Jesus, as he just studied, Lord,
[33:22] and try to find the mind of the Lord.
[33:24] Lord, we just pray and ask that may your
[33:25] Holy Spirit, Lord, just quicken the word
[33:27] as it's preached. May it change [music]

[33:58] After you've given this evening, you may
[34:00] be seated.
[34:03] Maybe while they prepare to come for
[34:05] their song, maybe we'll sing this little
[34:06] light of mine.
[34:09] This little light of mine,
[34:13] I'm going to let it [singing] shine. Oh,

[53:27] have your Bibles. Let's turn in the
[53:29] scriptures tonight.
[53:32] Romans chapter 13
[53:35] verse 11. We'll start there and have our
[53:38] seats. Then we'll have a a longer
[53:40] scripture reading.
[53:48] Romans chapter 13 and verse 11.
[53:53] And that knowing the time that now say
[53:56] now turn your neighbor say now.
[54:02] Now it's high time to awake out of
[54:04] sleep. For now is our salvation nearer
[54:08] than we believe. The night is far spent.
[54:12] The day is at hand. Let us therefore
[54:14] cast off the works of darkness. And let
[54:17] us put on the armor of the light. Let us
[54:20] walk honestly in the day, not in
[54:22] riotness and drunken, not in chambering,
[54:25] wantness, not in strife and imming, but
[54:27] put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ. Listen
[54:30] now. Make no provisions for the flesh to
[54:33] fulfill the lust thereof. You may have
[54:36] your seats.
[54:39] I want to read this just from the
[54:40] amplified before we turn over to Judges
[54:42] chapter 6. But the amplified said this,
[54:44] I just like how it says says and this is
[54:46] verse 11. Beside this, you know that a
[54:48] critical hour this is.
[54:51] We're sitting in a critical hour. Amen.
[54:54] He says, "It's how it's high time now
[54:56] for you to wake up out of your sleep to
[54:59] rouse to reality." Oh, for salvation,
[55:04] the final deliverance is nearer to us
[55:06] now than we first believed. Says, "The
[55:09] night is far gone. The day is almost
[55:11] here. Let us then drop or fling away the
[55:14] works and deeds of darkness and put on
[55:16] the full armor of light. Amen. Turn over
[55:19] to Judges chapter 6. And I know this is
[55:21] more reading than I normally do. And I'm
[55:22] normally already rolling, but uh there's
[55:25] quite a bit of scriptures here. I just
[55:26] want to just to read for a foundation
[55:28] and then we're going to preach. Amen.
[55:29] We're going to have church tonight.
[55:30] Amen. I'm excited to be here. Amen. I'm
[55:33] excited to be a Christian. I'm excited
[55:35] that he decided I could be in this hour
[55:37] and the final runners. Amen. the ones
[55:39] that would take this thing all the way
[55:41] to the end time. Listen, saints of God,
[55:43] we've got a great responsibility in this
[55:45] end time. Amen. Nobody else can take
[55:47] your place.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; I know sometimes you're like, "Hey, if
[55:51] they just go ahead and do it, then I
[55:52] don't have to." Listen, they can't do
[55:54] what you've got to do.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; You've got to do what you've got to do.
[56:00] Gideon Judges chapter 6 start reading
[56:03] actually at verse one says and the
[56:05] children of Israel did evil in the sight
[56:06] of the Lord and the Lord delivered them
[56:08] in the hand of many seven years and the
[56:11] hand of Minion prevailed against Israel
[56:12] and because the Minionites the children
[56:14] of Israel made them dens which are in
[56:16] the mountains and caves and strongholds.
[56:18] And so it was when Israel had sw sown
[56:21] that the Minionites came up and
[56:22] Amalachitis and the children of east
[56:24] even they come up against them and they
[56:25] encamped against them and destroyed the
[56:27] increase of the earth to all come unto
[56:29] God and left no substance for the Israel
[56:32] neither sheep nor ox nor rats. For they
[56:35] came up with their cattle on their tents
[56:36] and they came as grasshoppers for a
[56:38] multitude for both they and their camels
[56:40] were without number and they entered
[56:42] into the land to destroy it. And Israel,
[56:45] Israel was greatly impoverished because
[56:47] of the Midionites. And children of
[56:48] Israel cried unto the Lord. And it came
[56:50] to pass when the children of Israel
[56:51] cried unto the Lord because of the
[56:52] Midionites. The Lord sent a prophet unto
[56:55] the children of Israel, which said unto
[56:56] them, Thus sayeth the Lord God, I
[56:58] brought you up out of Egypt, brought you
[57:00] forth out of the house of bondage, and I
[57:02] delivered you out of the hand of the
[57:03] Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
[57:05] that oppressed you, and dread them out
[57:07] from before you, and gave you their
[57:08] land. I said unto you, I am the Lord
[57:10] your God. Fear not the gods of Amorites,
[57:13] in the whose land ye dwell, but ye have
[57:15] not obeyed my voice. And there came an
[57:18] angel in the Lord, and sat under an oak,
[57:20] which was in Ofra, and pertain unto
[57:22] Joash, that Ebzite, and his son Gideon,
[57:25] thresh wheat by the ry press to hide
[57:27] from the Midians. And the angel of the
[57:29] Lord appeared unto him, and said, The
[57:30] Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of
[57:33] valor. And Gideon said unto him,"Oh
[57:35] Lord," said unto him, "Oh my Lord, if
[57:37] the Lord be with us, and why this, and
[57:40] all this befallen us, and where all the
[57:43] miracles which our father told us,
[57:44] saying, Do not the Lord bring us up out
[57:46] of Egypt? But now the Lord have forsaken
[57:48] us and deliver us in the hand of the
[57:49] Minionites?" And the Lord looked upon
[57:51] him, and said, "Go in this thy might,
[57:54] and thou shalt save Israel from the hand
[57:56] of Minions Minionites, have not I sent
[57:58] thee." And he said unto him, "Oh my
[57:59] Lord, wherefore wither shall I save
[58:02] Israel? Behold, my family is poor in
[58:04] Manasses. I'm the least in my father's
[58:07] house.
[58:09] Think about it now. And he said unto
[58:11] him, if thou have found grace in thy
[58:12] sight, then show me a sign that thou
[58:14] talkest with me, and he part not hence,
[58:16] and I pray thee until I come unto thee,
[58:17] and bring forth and present it before
[58:20] thee. And I will tarry until thou come
[58:22] again.
[58:28] I want to take a thought if I might of
[58:30] awakening a warrior. Awakening a
[58:34] warrior. You know, as we begin to look
[58:36] at the scriptures here, and I read this
[58:37] at the very beginning, let me read you a
[58:39] couple quotes here. I just I'm trying to
[58:41] lay a foundation, believe it or not.
[58:42] Amen. It says, "The time had come."
[58:45] Brother Brandon will say this, "When
[58:46] playing church had come to a halt with
[58:48] God, there was no more playing church.
[58:50] We must get down to business." Let me
[58:53] say that again. We must get down to
[58:57] business. And let me tell you, it's the
[58:58] same as same as Jesus. It was THE
[59:01] FATHER'S BUSINESS. HE'S GOT THE SAME
[59:02] BUSINESS going on. And he's got children
[59:05] that are yielded to the spirit of God.
[59:07] AND THEY'RE ABOUT THE FATHER'S BUSINESS.
[59:09] AND THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST SAYS,
[59:11] "WHAT?" THEY SAY, "AMEN, LORD. WHATEVER
[59:14] IT MIGHT BE, LORD, LET ME BE ABOUT YOUR
[59:16] BUSINESS."
[59:18] He says, ' AND I TRUST THE SAME GOD WILL
[59:20] PLACE THIS UPON THE heart of the people
[59:21] tonight that it's time for the halt of
[59:24] playing church, playing religious,
[59:27] playing righteous. Now is the time for
[59:30] action. How many believe he's with me?
[59:33] Now is the time for action, saints of
[59:35] God. You say, "What are we waiting on,
[59:37] brother Matt?" There's nothing WE'RE
[59:38] WAITING ON. GOD'S GIVEN US THE HOLY
[59:40] GHOST. HE'S GIVEN US THE MYSTERIES. HE'S
[59:42] GIVEN US THE FULLNESS OF THE WORLD. IT'S
[59:44] TIME FOR US TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD AND
[59:47] GO INTO ACTION. AMEN. SO MANY TIMES WE
[59:49] THINK, LORD, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[59:51] EVERYTHING. LISTEN, THE DISCIPLES DIDN'T
[59:53] UNDERSTAND THIS THING. YOU KNOW WHAT HE
[59:54] TOLD THEM? GO.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? I'M
[59:59] [groaning and screaming] GOING TO FOLLOW
[1:00:00] THE SAME VOICE THAT CALLED ME OUT OF
[1:00:02] DARKNESS. HE'S THE SAME VOICE THAT'S
[1:00:04] SPEAKING TO ME TONIGHT. AND HE'S TOLD US
[1:00:06] IT'S TIME FOR ACTION. LITTLE BRIDE.
[1:00:08] THERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO. TAKE
[1:00:10] THIS WORD OF GOD. TAKE THIS MESSAGE. PUT
[1:00:13] IT UPON YOUR LIPS AND GO FIGHT EVERY
[1:00:15] DEMON THAT'S TRYING TO HOLD YOU BACK.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Brother say this. He says when the word
[1:00:21] has been spoken for a certain
[1:00:22] generation, there's going to be somebody
[1:00:24] rise on the scene and fulfill that word.
[1:00:28] Am I talking to somebody tonight that
[1:00:30] says, Lord, be it unto me according to
[1:00:33] that word. LORD, NOT THAT I'LL JUST
[1:00:35] UNDERSTAND IT. NOT THAT I'LL JUST KNOW
[1:00:36] THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET, BUT I'LL TAKE
[1:00:38] THE VERY MESSAGE THAT GOD HAS GIVEN ME.
[1:00:41] COME ON, WARRIORS. I'M SPEAKING TO
[1:00:44] WARRIORS TONIGHT. YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE
[1:00:46] YOU'RE A WARRIOR, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:00:47] [screaming] WARRIOR.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[1:00:52] Now. Now means present. Well, glory. Now
[1:00:56] I'm going to knock that over.
[1:00:59] Hold on. I got to fix it. We got to hear
[1:01:01] Jeff.
[1:01:04] NOW IS YOUR TIME.
[1:01:07] YOU'RE NOT WAITING FOR ANOTHER
[1:01:08] MESSENGER. NOW IS YOUR TIME, LITTLE
[1:01:10] BRIDE. NOW IS YOUR TIME. WHAT DOES NOW
[1:01:13] MEAN? PRESENT TENSE. I DON'T know about
[1:01:15] you, I need a present tense God. LISTEN.
[1:01:18] AND WE'VE GOT A PRESENT TENSE GOD. AND
[1:01:20] THE PRESENT TENSE GOD IS WAITING FOR YOU
[1:01:22] TO SAY, "LORD, I BELIEVE YOUR WORD, AND
[1:01:24] I'M GOING TO PUT ACTION BEHIND YOUR
[1:01:26] WORD." YOU START PUTTING ACTION, WHICH
[1:01:28] IS YOUR FAITH BEING EXPRESSED THROUGH
[1:01:30] YOUR WORKS, AND GOD WILL MEET YOU TIME
[1:01:32] AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN. START PUTTING
[1:01:35] IT INTO ACTION. START THINKING. QUIT
[1:01:38] THINKING THIS IS WHAT I SHOULD BE DOING
[1:01:40] AND GET TO DOING WHAT YOU SHOULD BE
[1:01:42] DOING.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY. DON'T MAKE ANY
[1:01:46] PROVISIONS FOR YOUR FLESH. SOMETIME
[1:01:48] WELL, I'M GOING TO PREACH. SOMETIMES
[1:01:50] YOUR FLESH IS YOUR IDOL.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY. [screaming]
[1:01:56] HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT, BROTHER M? YOU'LL
[1:01:57] DO WHAT YOUR FLESH WANTS TO DO WHEN THE
[1:01:59] WORD SAYS DON'T DO IT.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; SO THEREFORE, [screaming] YOU'RE PILING
[1:02:03] TO YOUR OWN IDOL, AND IT'S YOU.
[1:02:08] WELL, GLORY.
[1:02:10] LISTEN, WE'RE NOT HERE TO PLAY CHURCH
[1:02:12] ANY LONGER. IT'S TIME WE GOT TO GO. AND
[1:02:15] I NEED EVERY ONE OF YOU. LET'S GO.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALL [screaming] WARRIORS. YOU MAY
[1:02:21] NOT THINK YOU ARE, BUT YOU'RE A MIGHTY,
[1:02:24] MIGHTY WARRIOR.
[1:02:28] Awakening a warrior. [sighs]
[1:02:32] Now is the time. The Bible said Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ the same yesterday.
[1:02:37] Come on, finish it for me. Hebrews 13:8.
[1:02:39] Jesus Christ the same yesterday.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Well, IF HE WAS THE SAME BACK THEN, HE'S
[1:02:45] THE SAME GOD. LISTEN, THIS PROPHET CAME
[1:02:47] TO GIDEON AND SAID, "DID I DELIVER YOU?
[1:02:49] DID NOT I TAKE CARE OF YOU? DID NOT I DO
[1:02:52] THIS [screaming] FOR YOU?"
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME GOD, THE SAME MESSAGE, THE
[1:02:58] SAME WORD. HE JUST NEEDS SOMEBODY TO
[1:03:02] TAKE IT AND GO WITH IT.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible says, beloved? Now
[1:03:12] we are the sons of God. Now, oh glory,
[1:03:17] I know a lot of us are thinking, "But
[1:03:19] man, I don't really feel like a son."
[1:03:20] That's all right. You take what the word
[1:03:22] said about you over your feelings.
[1:03:24] That's where we stop a lot of times. We
[1:03:26] got our feelings of how we feel when we
[1:03:28] come to church. Well, COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:03:31] IT'S TIME. LISTEN, WHAT DID BROTHER?
[1:03:32] [screaming] HE GAVE I LISTENED SUNDAY.
[1:03:34] HE GAVE YOU A SHIRT. FEELINGS ARE
[1:03:37] OVERRATED. IT'S TIME WE START STEPPING
[1:03:40] OVER OUR FEELINGS AND START SPEAKING THE
[1:03:42] WORD OF GOD. IF GOD SAID I COULD HAVE A
[1:03:44] BABY, LET ME START SAYING I'M GOING TO
[1:03:46] HAVE A BABY. IF GOD SAID I [screaming]
[1:03:48] COULD BE HEALED, LET ME START SPEAKING
[1:03:50] IT.
[1:03:52] COME ON, SOMEBODY. IT'S TIME WE TAKE
[1:03:54] WHAT GOD GAVE US AND [screaming] GO WITH
[1:03:56] IT. YOU ARE THE WARRIORS.
[1:04:02] Brother Matt, Ron's a warrior. Ron is a
[1:04:05] warrior and he's doing what he's
[1:04:06] supposed to do. And Andrew is a warrior
[1:04:08] and he's doing what he's supposed to do.
[1:04:10] We're preaching the word of God that you
[1:04:12] MIGHT RECOGNIZE WHO YOU ARE.
[1:04:18] Come on, somebody. Brother Matt, I'm of
[1:04:20] weak faith. Brother said, "Never confess
[1:04:21] that." So, if you got that thought going
[1:04:23] through your mind right now, WHY DON'T
[1:04:25] YOU TAKE THAT CLOUD THAT'S HOLDING BACK
[1:04:26] THE SUPERNATURAL AND LET THE WIND OF THE
[1:04:28] HOLY GHOST, WHY DON'T YOU BLOW IT OUT OF
[1:04:30] YOUR LIFE?
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, the sun stands all the time. Am
[1:04:35] I right?
[1:04:37] I'm from Indiana. There's a period from
[1:04:39] about November to about February, you
[1:04:41] don't see the sun very much. In fact,
[1:04:43] you get I think it's there's a condition
[1:04:45] they get. I don't even know what it is.
[1:04:47] It's But I tell you what, I loved coming
[1:04:48] south to preach in the winter. I
[1:04:50] literally pull my face over to the side
[1:04:52] and be like, "That is just shun." I was
[1:04:54] like a plant growing.
[1:04:57] I was happy to see it. I'm not kid. I
[1:04:59] came down to brother Lloyd and the sun
[1:05:00] down 64 was just just I had my I was all
[1:05:04] over the side.
[1:05:06] 22 degrees outside, but man, the sun was
[1:05:08] shining.
[1:05:12] Listen, this world might be as cold as
[1:05:14] COLD CAN BE. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:05:16] THE SEN IS SHINING TONIGHT. AND HE'S
[1:05:18] BRINGING HIS PREDESTINATED SEAT TO A
[1:05:20] PLACE THEY RECOGNIZE. YOU ARE A MIGHTY
[1:05:23] ARMY.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You are.
[1:05:29] Little Noah. You're a part of this army,
[1:05:31] buddy. And you're a mighty warrior. Your
[1:05:34] words speak in heaven. Come on,
[1:05:35] SOMEBODY. YOUR WORDS MOVE MOUNTAINS.
[1:05:39] IF THOU CAN'T BELIEVE, IT DIDN'T PUT AN
[1:05:41] AGE LIMIT ON THAT. THEN WHY DO you
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Well, preach somebody OUT OF THE MOUTH
[1:05:50] OF BABE. Sometimes maybe we need a babe
[1:05:51] to tell us, "Hey, you're an idiot."
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Kids, don't you dare do that.
[1:06:01] But when you speak the word,
[1:06:03] write to your parents. Come on. Some of
[1:06:05] you kids know this Bible. Some of you
[1:06:08] kids know this message. Come on. YOU CAN
[1:06:10] CHANGE AN ATMOSPHERE, YOUNG PEOPLE, IN
[1:06:12] YOUR HOMES. COME ON, SOMEBODY. LISTEN,
[1:06:15] THE DEVIL WILL GET [screaming] ON DADDY.
[1:06:17] THE DEVIL WILL GET ON MOMMY. BUT WHY
[1:06:18] DON'T YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS
[1:06:20] NOT BECOMING OF A CHRISTIAN. MOM AND
[1:06:22] DAD, [screaming] WHY DON'T WE PRAY?"
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; AND WHY DON'T YOU PARENTS HAVE ENOUGH
[1:06:26] UMP INSIDE OF YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:06:28] YOU'RE RIGHT."
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW where this is from, but all
[1:06:31] right. Here we go.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Well, preach, brother Matt. LISTEN. I
[1:06:35] WANT TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED ME TO BE AND
[1:06:38] I'M NOT SETTLING BACK FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
[1:06:40] HE'S CALLED ME TO BE A WARRIOR. HE'S
[1:06:42] CALLED YOU TO BE A WARRIOR. HE'S CALLED
[1:06:45] YOU TO [screaming] TAKE GROUND.
[1:06:51] Let me read you a few quotes here. Jesus
[1:06:53] Christ in the beginning in the building
[1:06:54] tonight to perform Jesus Christ is in
[1:06:57] the building tonight to perform
[1:06:58] miracles.
[1:07:00] How many needs a miracle?
[1:07:03] Well, you showed up to the right place.
[1:07:08] Man, let that sink in for just me. If
[1:07:09] you would just believe that that the God
[1:07:11] that's made heaven and earth is in the
[1:07:13] building tonight, then whatever you have
[1:07:15] need of, let your faith go and say, you
[1:07:17] know what, it's mine.
[1:07:21] And right there, there's every thought
[1:07:22] in hell trying to come against you.
[1:07:24] Well, why don't you fight every thought
[1:07:25] in hell and say, you know what, that's
[1:07:26] the word of God and it's worth fighting
[1:07:28] for.
[1:07:34] He says Jesus Christ is the building
[1:07:35] there tonight to perform Moses. But he
[1:07:37] does it through his church, his people.
[1:07:38] They shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:07:40] they shall recover. Who's he doing it
[1:07:41] through?
[1:07:43] The preachers? No, no, no. He didn't say
[1:07:45] that. He said the people.
[1:07:52] So sisters, when your husband's sick,
[1:07:55] don't you be afraid to lay your hand on
[1:07:57] him and you begin to pray the prayer of
[1:07:59] faith and you watch God move in the
[1:08:01] situation. Come on, somebody.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; What are you doing, brother Matt? I'm an
[1:08:06] awakening a warrior. Come on, warriors.
[1:08:09] Come on. Draw your sword. IT AIN'T TIME
[1:08:12] FOR JUST BROTHER RON TO FIGHT. BROTHER
[1:08:14] ANDREW AND BROTHER MATT AND BROTHER MATT
[1:08:15] AND BROTHER WILLIAM. IT AIN'T JUST TIME
[1:08:17] FOR HIM TO FIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO
[1:08:19] FIGHT. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO WIN. IT'S
[1:08:21] FINE FOR YOU TO RECOGNIZE WHO YOU
[1:08:22] [screaming] ARE. YOU ARE A WARRIOR.
[1:08:29] Says in my name they will cast out
[1:08:31] devils, evil spirits. Is that right? The
[1:08:33] commission given to the church. That's
[1:08:34] what the matter of the church today. It
[1:08:35] doesn't know its position. If you know
[1:08:38] positionally who you was and what you
[1:08:39] are tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble
[1:08:41] person in the building in the next five
[1:08:42] minutes. That sounds pretty good,
[1:08:43] doesn't it?
[1:08:45] Why don't you just start believing it?
[1:08:47] Why don't you quit questioning it? Quit
[1:08:49] looking for some sensation. Quit looking
[1:08:50] for some feeling and JUST TAKE GOD AT
[1:08:53] his word.
[1:08:55] DON'T MAKE IT HARD. JUST SAY, "LORD, I
[1:08:59] BELIEVE IT.
[1:09:00] LORD, I [screaming] RECEIVE IT. LORD, I
[1:09:04] NEED IT. LORD, IF YOU'RE IN THE
[1:09:06] BUILDING, pass by my way and nobody else
[1:09:08] needs it. Father, I need it. I need a
[1:09:10] refilling of the Holy Ghost. I'VE BEEN
[1:09:12] FIGHTING MIND BATTLES ALL WEEK. I NEED A
[1:09:14] REFRESHING IN YOUR PRESENCE. THIS IS MY
[1:09:16] SERVICE. THIS IS MY TIME. AND I'M HERE
[1:09:18] TO FIGHT FOR IT.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO FIGHT FOR YOU.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; I'M LEAVING VICTORIOUS IN JESUS NAME.
[1:09:26] AND [screaming] YOU ARE TOO.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But now you shouldn't SAY THAT. WHY
[1:09:31] SHOULDN'T I SAY THAT? I'M LETTING HELL
[1:09:33] KNOW. BACK OFF OF GOD'S PEOPLE.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; I'M A SON OF GOD STANDING IN MY
[1:09:40] POSITION. I WILL NOT BOW TO ANY
[1:09:42] [screaming] DEVIL.
[1:09:49] And you should do the same.
[1:09:55] Let me go to the next one. Ah, let me
[1:09:57] finish this one. They're good. If you
[1:10:00] know position who you was, what you were
[1:10:02] tonight, there wouldn't be a feeble
[1:10:04] person here in the next five minutes.
[1:10:05] That's right. The thing of is you're
[1:10:06] looking That's right.
[1:10:09] Sorry, Virginia slipped through. He
[1:10:12] said, 'The thing of it is you're looking
[1:10:13] off in the momentum for something to
[1:10:15] happen when it's already here. Now we
[1:10:18] are the sons of God, not we will be. We
[1:10:21] are right now.
[1:10:24] Let me skip down another quote. Brother
[1:10:25] Ram, why are you hitting on those things
[1:10:27] at night?
[1:10:29] is the reason this is you can't get if
[1:10:32] you can get can ever get the scare out
[1:10:35] of the church and let them realize who
[1:10:38] they are and what they positionally
[1:10:41] healing will be the simplest message you
[1:10:44] ever had to preach or anything else but
[1:10:46] you're scared you're afraid you don't
[1:10:50] realize you're sons and daughters of God
[1:10:55] and now not we will be We are now. Say
[1:11:00] now with me.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Now, then what do you have need of?
[1:11:06] Come on, somebody. But now I don't have
[1:11:08] any need. Well, why don't you begin to
[1:11:10] praise him like a son would praise him?
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Why don't you begin to look at the
[1:11:13] prodical son and think back where you
[1:11:14] came from and think, Lord, I didn't
[1:11:16] deserve it, but God, there was something
[1:11:18] DOWN ON THE INSIDE OF ME THAT I CAME TO
[1:11:20] MYSELF. I'M GLAD I CAME TO MYSELF AND
[1:11:22] I'M COMING TO MYSELF EVEN NOW. YOU ARE A
[1:11:26] [screaming] MIGHTY WARRIOR. THIS IS WHAT
[1:11:28] JESUS SAYS TO HIS BRIDE. YOU DON'T HAVE
[1:11:30] TO TAKE ANYTHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BACK
[1:11:32] DOWN FROM ANYTHING. YOU ARE MY
[1:11:34] [screaming]
[1:11:35] REDEEMED BRIDE. I PAID THE PRICE FOR
[1:11:38] YOU. I PAID FOR YOUR HEALING. I PAID FOR
[1:11:40] YOUR INIQUITIES. I PAID FOR YOUR SINS.
[1:11:42] THEN WHY DO YOU LIVE BELOW WHERE GOD
[1:11:44] CALLED YOU?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
[1:11:51] SO WHATEVER DEVIL THAT'S KEPT YOU IN THE
[1:11:53] TRENCHES AND MADE YOU THINK YOU GOT TO
[1:11:55] STAY THERE, I SAY [screaming] BOOT
[1:11:56] DEVIL, GET OFF OF GOD'S PROPERTY.
[1:11:59] THEY'RE FREE IN JESUS' NAME. AND IF THE
[1:12:02] SUN SET ME FREE, [screaming] THEN I'M
[1:12:04] FREE INDEED.
[1:12:10] The Bible says awake. How many ever
[1:12:13] heard your mom wake you up for school?
[1:12:16] My Ella's here. You know what she says?
[1:12:19] Two more minutes, daddy.
[1:12:23] I'm glad she doesn't say 12.
[1:12:26] Two more. That's all she wants. Two more
[1:12:27] minutes. I remember my mom waking up me.
[1:12:31] It was more like a glass of water after
[1:12:34] 25 more minutes. And then I'm like,
[1:12:38] I pray some of you get
[1:12:43] I pray some of you get that tonight to
[1:12:45] recognize you aren't just here for no
[1:12:47] reason.
[1:12:50] COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU GOT A POSITION.
[1:12:52] YOU GOT AN [screaming] AUTHORITY IN
[1:12:54] HEAVEN. DRAW YOUR SWORD.
[1:12:58] THAT'S MEANT FOR CUTTING. YES, IT'S
[1:13:00] MEANT FOR CUTTING. IT'S MEANT FOR
[1:13:02] CUTTING EVERY PROMISE OF GOD OUT OF IT.
[1:13:04] GO TO CUTTING ON THE WORD OF GOD. YOU
[1:13:06] NEED HEALING, GO TO CUTTING ON THE WORD
[1:13:08] OF GOD. SAY, "LORD, I NEED MY HEALING.
[1:13:12] Every thought that comes contrary, I am
[1:13:14] the God that he health thee. By his
[1:13:16] stripes, I'M HEALED." LISTEN, IT'S JUST
[1:13:18] THAT SIMPLE.
[1:13:21] WALK RIGHT INTO YOUR healing
[1:13:24] spiritually. I'm speaking to people
[1:13:26] sometimes the devil has beat you down to
[1:13:29] think you're cowards, you're nobodies,
[1:13:30] you're never going to get it.
[1:13:33] I'm preaching to the right crowd
[1:13:34] tonight.
[1:13:36] You know what that is? The devil is so
[1:13:39] stinking scared that you recognize who
[1:13:44] you are.
[1:13:46] So he puts I'm getting ahead of myself.
[1:13:50] Teaser.
[1:13:53] You know, my mom would eventually go,
[1:13:55] "Matt, get up."
[1:14:00] I don't know about you, she be to shout.
[1:14:04] Well, I'm here to let you know, there's
[1:14:05] been a shout go out in this end time.
[1:14:07] And what has it been to do? It's been to
[1:14:09] awaken the bride, to make her recognize
[1:14:11] who she is. You are in a SLEEPING
[1:14:13] SLUMBER. BUT THUS SAY THE LORD, COME BY
[1:14:15] YOUR WAY. AND SAID, "THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:14:16] ABOUT THAT VOICE. I CAN'T GET AWAY FROM
[1:14:18] IT." LISTEN, I TALKED TO A MAN. LISTEN,
[1:14:20] BY CHANCE LAST WEEKEND. I'm in
[1:14:22] Pennsylvania and there's a brother from
[1:14:24] Brother Danny Stevens in the church.
[1:14:27] He said, I said, "Man," he just gave me
[1:14:29] a testimony. He said, "I met a man from
[1:14:31] Indiana. I knew him. He was right from
[1:14:33] where I was at." He said, and he told me
[1:14:35] about a prophet. He said, "A year later,
[1:14:38] he came back down to Florida." He said,
[1:14:40] "I met him in the driveway. Tell me
[1:14:42] more."
[1:14:45] Listen, you can't stop a predestinated
[1:14:47] seed when they hear something from God.
[1:14:49] There's an awakening that HAPPENS ON THE
[1:14:51] INSIDE OF THEM. THEY CAN'T STOP IT.
[1:14:53] LISTEN, THE DEVIL WOULD LIKE TO COW YOU
[1:14:55] DOWN AS, "OH, YOU JUST HAD A BORN AGAIN
[1:14:57] EXPERIENCE." NO, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
[1:14:59] YOU'RE A MIGHTY WARRIOR.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; Some of you going to get it tonight.
[1:15:05] Some of you going to recognize you can
[1:15:06] fight your own battles. You don't need
[1:15:08] me to pray for you. Listen, we will pray
[1:15:10] for you. We will pray over you. We will
[1:15:12] pray with you. WE WILL FAST FOR YOU. WE
[1:15:14] WILL PRAY FOR YOU. WE WILL DO ANYTHING
[1:15:15] WE CAN FOR YOU. BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU
[1:15:18] RECOGNIZE YOUR VOICE HAS POWER. YOUR
[1:15:22] VOICE [screaming] CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS.
[1:15:23] YOUR PRAYER.
[1:15:27] I think God wants us to get this.
[1:15:29] Listen, I wrote this down. Brother
[1:15:32] brother preacher on weapons of our
[1:15:33] welfare. By the way, that was part two
[1:15:35] last Sunday. He didn't label it. I
[1:15:37] called him, said, "Hey, man. You label
[1:15:39] that."
[1:15:41] He didn't. He goes, "Oh, man. I didn't
[1:15:42] do that. It was weapons of our warfare.
[1:15:45] Brother Andrew would preach a message.
[1:15:47] United by faith, united by the battle,
[1:15:49] David's mighty man.
[1:15:52] Brother Matt would preach a message.
[1:15:53] Don't mistake my kindness for weakness.
[1:16:00] YOU THINK GOD'S TRYING TO GET SOME TO
[1:16:02] THE CHURCH? HE'S TRYING TO AWAKEN YOU.
[1:16:05] YOU ARE [screaming] A MIGHTY ARMY. YOU
[1:16:07] ARE AN INVINCIBLE ARMY. YOU ARE MY
[1:16:10] BRIDE. YOU HAVE THE SAYITH THE LORD AND
[1:16:13] YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; But I'm afraid I'll make a mistake. You
[1:16:18] know what? You'll never do anything.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You remember the man with no eraser?
[1:16:23] What'd he do? NOTHING.
[1:16:26] YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. BUT I
[1:16:28] [screaming] SAY TO YOU, DRAW YOUR SWORD
[1:16:30] AND GET TO FIGHTING.
[1:16:35] LISTEN, DADDIES, you ain't got to claim
[1:16:37] anything the devil tries to put on your
[1:16:38] home. You're the priest of that home.
[1:16:40] It's about time you take it and put it
[1:16:42] in order. Come on, SOMEBODY. YOU AIN'T
[1:16:44] GOT TO TAKE THE DEVIL COMING IN AND
[1:16:46] STEALING YOUR STEALING YOUR CHILD'S
[1:16:48] MIND. LISTEN, DEVIL COMES INTO MY HOUSE
[1:16:50] AND I RECOGNIZE THAT'S NOTHING BUT A
[1:16:52] DEVIL. I BEGIN TO PRAY FIRST BEFORE I
[1:16:54] EVER TALK TO MY CHILD.
[1:16:57] LISTEN, HE WILL COME ANY WAY HE CAN GET
[1:16:59] INTO THAT HOUSE. BUT YOU'RE THE HIGH
[1:17:01] PRIEST OF THAT HOME. YOU STAND AND SAY,
[1:17:03] "YOU KNOW WHAT, SATAN? I'M A CHILD OF
[1:17:05] GOD. [screaming] I'M A WARRIOR OF THE
[1:17:07] CROSS. YOU HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT IN MY
[1:17:10] HOME. SO, LET ME SHOW you the door and
[1:17:12] you better not come back cuz you'll
[1:17:14] leave headless.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'm thinking about taking your
[1:17:19] head off right now.
[1:17:23] LISTEN, MAS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP
[1:17:25] WITH IT.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Your husband GETS IN A FUNK FOR A COUPLE
[1:17:30] DAYS. WELL, PREACH, brother Matt.
[1:17:33] WON'T YOU BEGIN TO PRAY FOR HIM INSTEAD
[1:17:37] OF complaining about him?
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And I can turn that vice versa right
[1:17:43] away.
[1:17:46] We're warriors. That means we keep our
[1:17:49] house fortified. You keep it fortified
[1:17:52] in what? Prayer. Go look up the quote.
[1:17:54] It's there. Fortify your house with
[1:17:56] prayer.
[1:18:00] Well, mama will begin to shout if you
[1:18:04] don't get up. I pray God doesn't have to
[1:18:07] do so much that way.
[1:18:10] Well, preacher man, listen. God's
[1:18:12] calling you tonight and he's letting you
[1:18:14] know you're a warrior. But that I don't
[1:18:16] feel like a warrior. It's all right. You
[1:18:17] don't have to feel like a warrior. You
[1:18:19] are identified with what he says.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not identified by my past.
[1:18:30] I'm not identified as a drunk. I'm not
[1:18:31] identified as as a pot smoker. I'm not
[1:18:34] identified as a cigarette drinker. I'm
[1:18:35] not identified as a cusser. I'm not
[1:18:37] identified with anything in THE WORLD.
[1:18:38] I'M IDENTIFIED IN BLOODBOUGHT, BORN
[1:18:41] AGAIN SON OF GOD. THAT'S HOW HE SEES ME.
[1:18:44] HE CANNOT SEE ME ANY OTHER WAY. WHY?
[1:18:46] BECAUSE HE'S LOOKING THROUGH THE BLOOD.
[1:18:48] WHY [screaming] DON'T YOU LOOK THROUGH
[1:18:49] THE BLOOD TONIGHT AND SAY, "LORD, I AM
[1:18:51] WHO YOU CALLED ME TO BE. I AM A WARRIOR.
[1:18:58] Let me read you this now.
[1:19:00] There's been a shout this end time.
[1:19:04] WHAT WAS IT? COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE.
[1:19:07] I'm going read a few quotes here. Just
[1:19:08] time together. He says, "My shadow will
[1:19:10] move every time. Everything of the my
[1:19:12] body moves and the Holy Spirit body of
[1:19:14] Christ will move just as Christ moves.
[1:19:16] And if Christ in heaven could ever get
[1:19:19] his physical body or his spiritual body
[1:19:21] on the earth moving as he wants it to
[1:19:23] move, watch for things to happen. Catch
[1:19:26] this now. It's beginning to come to
[1:19:28] life. They've paralyzed it long enough.
[1:19:32] You know who he's talking about?
[1:19:34] Denominations. And I'm here to say those
[1:19:36] message denominations within the message
[1:19:38] have tried to paralyze the move of God
[1:19:41] way too long. If God wants a prayer
[1:19:43] line, there'll be a prayer line. and he
[1:19:44] wants laying on the sick. They'll be
[1:19:45] laying they'll be laying hands on the
[1:19:46] sick. LISTEN, I DON'T WANT YOUR IDEA
[1:19:48] WHAT THE MESSAGE IS. I DON'T WANT YOUR
[1:19:50] WATERED DOWN GOSPEL. I BELIEVE IN A FULL
[1:19:53] GOSPEL. I BELIEVE IN A SUPERNATURAL GOD.
[1:19:55] I BELIEVE GOD WILL DELIVER. [screaming]
[1:19:56] AND HE IS STILL DELIVERING.
[1:20:01] You've come into another age. Well, you
[1:20:03] stay in your age. I'm right here with
[1:20:05] Jesus.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; He says they paralyzed it long enough,
[1:20:09] but the Holy Spirit is bringing life
[1:20:11] into it and beginning to wake it up.
[1:20:14] beginning to move because it sees its
[1:20:16] position. This is the third seal that
[1:20:18] was in 1955. This is brother Ramon says
[1:20:20] the bride hasn't had a revival yet. Says
[1:20:22] there's been no revival, no no
[1:20:24] manifestation of God to serve the bride
[1:20:26] yet. See, we're looking for it now.
[1:20:28] It'll take those seven unknown thunders
[1:20:30] back there to wake her up again. See?
[1:20:34] Yeah. He'll send it. He promised it.
[1:20:36] Catch this. 1964. He says, "How many
[1:20:39] reads it?" You know, you see it all the
[1:20:40] time. Fast pray. Fast pray. It's all you
[1:20:42] hear. Fast pray. We're going to have a
[1:20:43] great breaking of the day. There's a
[1:20:44] great thing going to happen. All of you
[1:20:46] pray, pray, pray. We're not too late.
[1:20:48] Why do they do that? Why do they do it?
[1:20:51] They want a great awakening. They're
[1:20:53] crying, believing there'll be awakening.
[1:20:55] They're good people. What is it? What
[1:20:56] have they done? They've not recognized
[1:20:58] the awakening of the bride
[1:21:02] by being a Christian. They feel the pull
[1:21:04] of the hour, but they haven't recognized
[1:21:06] what's been done. That's what's making
[1:21:07] them feel that way. They know
[1:21:09] something's supposed to happen.
[1:21:12] Aren't you glad you haven't missed it?
[1:21:14] There's been a seven thunders that has
[1:21:15] gone out before you. What is that? IT
[1:21:17] WAS THE SHOUT TO BRING THE BRIDE TO AN
[1:21:20] AWAKENING OF WHO SHE WAS, WHO SHE'S
[1:21:22] GOING TO BE. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A BOOK
[1:21:24] OF REDEMPTION THAT WAS OPEN THAT YOU
[1:21:26] MIGHT SEE YOUR NAME. HOW DO I SEE MY
[1:21:28] NAME, BROTHER MATT? WHAT IS THAT PULL ON
[1:21:30] YOUR LIFE? WHY CAN'T YOU GET AWAY FROM
[1:21:32] IT? YOU'VE TRIED TO GET AWAY [screaming]
[1:21:33] FROM IT, BUT GOD, RICH IN MERCY, IS
[1:21:36] CALLING YOU. YOU [screaming] ARE A GREAT
[1:21:39] WARRIOR, LITTLE BRIDE.
[1:21:43] I want to take that over to Ezekiel. Can
[1:21:45] these dry bones live?
[1:21:49] Can these dry bones live? What did he
[1:21:51] tell the son of man? Why don't you start
[1:21:52] prophesying? Aren't you glad we've had a
[1:21:54] son of man begin to prophesy to us in
[1:21:56] the end time?
[1:21:58] What did he do, brother brother Andrew
[1:22:00] preacher last week? Uniting. IT'S THE
[1:22:02] UNITING TIME OF THE BODY OF JESUS
[1:22:04] CHRIST. WE'VE GOT ONE MIND. WE'VE GOT
[1:22:06] ONE THOUGHT. WE'VE GOT ONE GOAL. WE'VE
[1:22:08] GOT ONE BAPTISM. WE GOT ONE HOLY GHOST.
[1:22:11] AND WE'RE MOVING TO [screaming] A
[1:22:12] RAPTURE.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Can these bones live? Catch this now. He
[1:22:17] asked him. He said, "Can these bones
[1:22:19] live?"
[1:22:20] At the very end of it, it said it'd be a
[1:22:23] great exceeding
[1:22:26] army.
[1:22:31] Let me get to Gideon. How many loves the
[1:22:33] Lord?
[1:22:36] Let me get to Gideon. We're going to get
[1:22:37] down home now.
[1:22:41] We're going to get to where we live.
[1:22:42] Here's Gideon. Israel had sinned and the
[1:22:46] many nights has stolen everything they
[1:22:48] had. You know, that's what the devil
[1:22:50] likes to do. He likes to steal your
[1:22:52] healing. He likes to steal your joy. He
[1:22:54] wants to take every revelation you've
[1:22:56] ever had. He wants to steal your peace
[1:22:58] of mind. Come on, somebody. He doesn't
[1:22:59] want you to have peace of mind. He
[1:23:01] doesn't want you to think anything of
[1:23:02] yourself. That you're no down little
[1:23:04] anything. Listen, we're humble, but we
[1:23:06] know who we are. We know what he did for
[1:23:09] us and we know who we are. Come on,
[1:23:10] somebody. It's time we get on the devil
[1:23:12] and say, "Listen, devil, I'm tired of
[1:23:14] you trying to steal MY JOY. I'M TIRED OF
[1:23:16] YOU TRYING TO STEAL MY SIGNED MIND. I'M
[1:23:18] TIRED OF YOU TRYING TO TAKE WHAT GOD
[1:23:20] RIGHTLY GAVE TO ME. IT'S MINE AND YOU
[1:23:23] CAN'T HAVE IT.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU DON'T FIGHT FOR IT, HE'S
[1:23:26] GOING TO STEAL IT FOR YOU.
[1:23:32] BROTHER MATT, I GOT IT. UH-HUH. Keep it
[1:23:34] now.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; How do I keep Brother says, "Stay
[1:23:38] constantly in the state of revival."
[1:23:41] Come on, somebody. Maybe you've fallen
[1:23:42] out of the state of revival. Well,
[1:23:43] you've come to the right place tonight.
[1:23:45] Why don't you get back into the revival?
[1:23:47] Get back under the spoken word that God
[1:23:49] is speaking to you tonight to let you
[1:23:50] know YOU ARE A MIGHTY WAR. I PRAY
[1:23:53] SOMEBODY WOULD AWAKE OUT OF THEIR
[1:23:54] SLUMBER. LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE THINGS OF
[1:23:56] THE WORLD WILL SWEEP US OFF TO SLEEP.
[1:23:58] YOU CARE MORE ABOUT FOOTBALL THAN YOU DO
[1:24:00] THIS. OR YOU CARE MORE ABOUT BASKETBALL
[1:24:01] [screaming] THAN YOU DO THAT. YOU CARE
[1:24:03] MORE ABOUT YOUR FINANCES, YOUR
[1:24:04] RETIREMENT THAN YOU DO GOING IN A
[1:24:06] RAPTURE. WELL, PREACH, BROTHER MAN. I AM
[1:24:08] PREACHING. WHY DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE
[1:24:10] THAT'S A DEVIL TRYING TO PUT YOU TO
[1:24:12] SLEEP AND RECOGNIZE GOD? LET ME GET BACK
[1:24:15] TO DOING WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.
[1:24:24] [sighs]
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; I ain't got a clock now. I got a timer.
[1:24:28] It's okay. 15 of you just checked out.
[1:24:32] He likes to steal your joy. You know
[1:24:34] why? Because he knows what the joy is.
[1:24:36] It's your strength. Listen, we're mighty
[1:24:39] warriors and we're not going to battle
[1:24:41] without joy.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to battle knowing I'm going to
[1:24:47] win.
[1:24:48] Listen, how many's ever went to a fight
[1:24:50] you know you're going to win? Well, I'm
[1:24:52] here to tell you it maybe it's not a
[1:24:54] maybe you're going to win. YOU'RE GONNA
[1:24:55] WIN. BUT MAN, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
[1:24:57] WIN. CAST [screaming] THAT THOUGHT OUT.
[1:25:00] YOU'RE GONNA WIN. WHAT YOU SAY THROUGH
[1:25:02] YOUR LIPS? I'm gonna win.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Say it again.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; One more time. Make it good.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Well, out of the mouth of two or three
[1:25:09] witnesses, LET IT BE ESTABLISHED. YOU'RE
[1:25:11] GOING TO WIN.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; That battle IS FACING YOU RIGHT NOW. WHY
[1:25:16] DON'T YOU TURN AROUND and say, "You know
[1:25:17] what? I'm tired of you stealing from me.
[1:25:19] I'm Listen, you try to steal my joy
[1:25:21] every Monday.
[1:25:25] He tries to bring that complex right
[1:25:26] back on your head. WELL, ONCE YOU'RE
[1:25:28] DONE, THAT COMPLEX IS NOT MINE. THAT IS
[1:25:30] STRAIGHT FROM THE PITS OF HELL, AND YOU
[1:25:32] CAN TAKE IT BACK TO THE PITS OF HELL. I
[1:25:34] DON'T CLAIM IT. I DON'T WANT IT. IT'S
[1:25:36] BEAT ME DOWN ENOUGH.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; HOW do you know what you're talking
[1:25:40] about? I've had them. Listen, I'm
[1:25:42] walking the dunness of life right now. I
[1:25:45] don't even really know who I am.
[1:25:48] What do you mean? I had a complex for so
[1:25:50] long, I thought that's who I was.
[1:25:56] But that is not who I am. I am not some
[1:25:59] back down nobody. I'm a daughter. I'm a
[1:26:02] son of God walking in the light of this
[1:26:05] blessed end time. I cannot lose. He
[1:26:07] called me by grace. He can't LOSE ME.
[1:26:10] COME ON, SOMEBODY. I'VE GOT A SWORD.
[1:26:12] I'VE GOT A SHIELD. LISTEN, BROTHER RON
[1:26:14] SAID LAST NIGHT OR LAST WEEK, THERE
[1:26:16] AIN'T NOTHING BACK HERE. SO WHY DON'T
[1:26:18] YOU TURN AND FACE THAT DEVIL? SAY, YOU
[1:26:20] KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED OF YOUR MOUTH.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT DAVID DID. I'M TIRED
[1:26:27] OF YOUR MOUTH.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; What you're saying
[1:26:34] doesn't line up. So that means you're a
[1:26:38] liar.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Let that sink in for just a minute. That
[1:26:44] thing that's been beating you down.
[1:26:53] [sighs]
[1:26:55] Listen, the devil likes to the
[1:26:57] Midianites. They want to keep Gideon to
[1:26:59] the place that he was hiding to get his
[1:27:01] food. Cow down. Listen, brother said
[1:27:04] this. It's time you found out who you
[1:27:05] are. The devil's trying to hide you back
[1:27:08] and tell you some little cow down
[1:27:09] something. You're not. You are as sons
[1:27:12] and daughters of God. The deed is not in
[1:27:14] heaven. It's in you. Catch this next
[1:27:18] word. Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] Why don't you say it with me?
[1:27:22] Hallelujah. Said, "Brother man, I don't
[1:27:24] feel like it's in me, but why don't you
[1:27:25] say hallelujah anyway?" You know why?
[1:27:27] Cuz the devil doesn't want you to know
[1:27:28] that you are who you say you are.
[1:27:30] Listen, I went to a meeting down in
[1:27:31] North Carolina. I couldn't study. I
[1:27:33] couldn't pray. Felt like I wasn't
[1:27:34] getting anywhere. And I said, "Lord,
[1:27:36] here I am. I'm just COMING WITH YOU."
[1:27:37] AND I HAD THE MOST POWERFUL MEETINGS
[1:27:39] SUNDAY MORNING. AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WHY?
[1:27:41] BECAUSE I WASN'T GOING TO LET MY
[1:27:42] THOUGHTS AND WHAT MY LISTEN, GOD HELPED
[1:27:44] ME. NOW LISTEN, GOD HELPED ME TO DO
[1:27:46] [screaming] IT. BUT I WASN'T GOING TO
[1:27:48] LET THAT MOVE ME BACK FROM STANDING IN
[1:27:50] MY PLACE OF DUTY AND SWINGING MY SWORD.
[1:27:53] AND THE POWER OF GOD DROPPED INTO THE
[1:27:55] BUILDING. AND WE HAD PRAYER LINE IN THE
[1:27:56] MORNING. [screaming] WE HAD PRAYER LINE
[1:27:58] EVENING. NOT FOR MY GLORY, BUT BECAUSE
[1:28:00] I'M NOT BACKING DOWN. [screaming] GOD
[1:28:02] CALLED ME TO THIS. WE'RE PREACHING IT.
[1:28:06] AND LET MY LIFE [screaming] SAY AMEN.
[1:28:15] I got in the car that night. I told my
[1:28:18] wife, I'm thankful for a wife that goes
[1:28:19] with me,
[1:28:21] listens to me,
[1:28:26] supposed to tell on her, not myself,
[1:28:28] listens to me whine every once in a
[1:28:30] while, and she just prays for me. Send
[1:28:33] me a word of encouragement.
[1:28:35] And I got in the car. I said, "Honey, I
[1:28:38] believe I know what it was." The devil
[1:28:40] was scared.
[1:28:44] Let me tell you, he's scared of what you
[1:28:46] can do.
[1:28:50] He's scared of what you young people.
[1:28:51] You said, "But man, I'm just young in
[1:28:52] this." That's all right. He's still
[1:28:53] scared of you.
[1:28:56] He's scared of your testimony. He's
[1:28:58] scared of your life. He's scared of the
[1:29:00] Holy Ghost. See, he knows he sees on the
[1:29:01] inside of you that if you ever begin to
[1:29:03] feed it the right way. Come on,
[1:29:04] somebody. You ever begin to get in this
[1:29:06] message, begin to feed on the right way,
[1:29:08] he knows you've become an invincible
[1:29:10] army. Oh, that's my next quote. Leads
[1:29:12] right into it. Amen. He says, he says,
[1:29:15] listen now. He says it exposes Satan. He
[1:29:18] hates Revelations where it's at. This is
[1:29:20] in the exposition church ages. [sighs]
[1:29:24] Yeah. Think
[1:29:28] it's in there.
[1:29:30] It exposes revealing the works,
[1:29:31] attempted destruction of God's people,
[1:29:33] the discrediting of God's word, right
[1:29:35] down to the time he's cast in a lake of
[1:29:36] fire. He cannot stand it. He knows that
[1:29:39] the people get the revelation of the
[1:29:41] true church and what she is and what she
[1:29:44] stands for and that she can do the
[1:29:47] greater work. She will be an invincible
[1:29:50] army.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what invincible means.
[1:29:54] You want it? I'm just I'm not very
[1:29:56] smart, so I look it up.
[1:29:59] Listen, you don't know what a word
[1:30:01] means? Look it up. Don't sit there.
[1:30:03] Listen, there's revelation standing
[1:30:04] behind the word meaning.
[1:30:13] Devil didn't like that, but that's all
[1:30:14] right. Gets people to dig a little bit
[1:30:16] farther. All of a sudden, listen, it
[1:30:18] ain't all in the root word of it. But I
[1:30:20] tell you what, when the Holy Spirit
[1:30:21] quickens, look up what that word means.
[1:30:23] Go digging.
[1:30:24] There's more revelation for you right
[1:30:26] there. Go digging for those golden
[1:30:28] nuggets, brother Jerry. Go digging for
[1:30:30] him,
[1:30:33] man. I love that guy over there.
[1:30:35] Praying, you get off this Sunday, man.
[1:30:39] Pray with us.
[1:30:41] How many loves Brother Jerry being here?
[1:30:42] I'm pray. I love Brother Jerry. Listen,
[1:30:44] I love seeing him sit over there.
[1:30:46] There's some of you are quiet, but you
[1:30:48] pull like all get out.
[1:30:53] Preacher loves it. Especially one that
[1:30:55] preaches by inspiration.
[1:30:59] That'd be me.
[1:31:02] Invincible. Incapable of being defeated.
[1:31:06] Say it with me. Incapable of being
[1:31:09] defeated. Man, I wish I could see the
[1:31:11] little boy in the mirror.
[1:31:15] Incapable.
[1:31:21] It's you, Brother Chris. Incapable of
[1:31:24] being defeated.
[1:31:26] It's you, buddy. Incapable.
[1:31:30] Quit waiting on a feeling. It's what the
[1:31:32] word of God called you to.
[1:31:38] Step into the power of it, bride. He
[1:31:41] just dropped in the building.
[1:31:44] He's here to vindicate what I'm telling
[1:31:45] you. If you just believe it,
[1:31:49] quit trying to feel it.
[1:31:52] feelings will be there. I guarantee you.
[1:31:55] You get down the fire the place you need
[1:31:56] him. Oh, he coming. You stood for my
[1:31:59] word. You didn't back down. Nobody else
[1:32:02] is coming. I'm coming down there with
[1:32:04] you. In fact, I've been here with you
[1:32:06] the whole time. AND NOW YOU SEE ME AND
[1:32:08] YOU SEE THE PURPOSE OF THIS. LISTEN,
[1:32:10] THOSE CH HEBREW CHILDREN WENT IN THEIR
[1:32:12] BOUND. BUT WHEN THEY CAME OUT THE OTHER
[1:32:14] SIDE, THERE WAS NOTHING BINDING THEM.
[1:32:21] GLORY.
[1:32:27] Let me read.
[1:32:30] I got 25 minutes. I'm doing good.
[1:32:33] Preach fast. Here we go.
[1:32:36] Gideon here. Think about [clears throat]
[1:32:37] Gideon.
[1:32:42] Verse 12. Now Gideon, brother said this.
[1:32:44] He said, "Now, Gideon was not when he
[1:32:46] was out there threshing the wheat, no
[1:32:47] doubt, but the prophet's message was
[1:32:49] going through his heart." Listen, I read
[1:32:50] all those scriptures for a purpose. When
[1:32:52] they cried unto the Lord, God sent him
[1:32:55] the word.
[1:32:57] AND THEY RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE
[1:32:59] PROPHET. IT'D BEEN SEVEN YEARS THEY'VE
[1:33:02] BEEN IN BONDAGE. COME ON, SOMEBODY.
[1:33:05] SEVEN YEARS THEY'VE BEEN IN BONDAGE. AND
[1:33:08] WHAT DID THIS PROPHET [screaming] DO? HE
[1:33:09] CAME DOWN AND GAVE THEM SEVEN REASONS
[1:33:10] AND SAID, "LISTEN, HERE IT IS. HERE IT
[1:33:12] IS. HERE IT IS. [screaming] HERE IT IS.
[1:33:14] OBEY THE VOICE.
[1:33:18] THE PROPHET DELIVERED [screaming] THE
[1:33:19] MESSAGE. AND A LOT OF GIDEONSS out there
[1:33:23] still scared to death.
[1:33:29] Maybe I'll get a little bit.
[1:33:31] Maybe I'll I'll feed my family.
[1:33:38] But aren't you thankful that behind the
[1:33:41] message came the angel of the Lord?
[1:33:44] The angel of the Lord still here on I
[1:33:47] believe he's talking about it last was
[1:33:49] Sunday. Yeah. Angel of Lord still here.
[1:33:52] John introduced us to Christ. William
[1:33:54] Brandham introduces to Christ. The angel
[1:33:57] of the Lord is still in the building
[1:33:58] tonight. And where the angel of the
[1:34:00] Lord, there are miracles that happen.
[1:34:01] Where the angel of the Lord, there's
[1:34:03] supernatural THAT HAPPEN. WHERE THERE'S
[1:34:04] ANGEL OF THE LORD, THERE'S AN AWAKENING
[1:34:06] OF THE PEOPLE OF GOD THAT THEY WOULD
[1:34:08] RECOGNIZE THIS IS WHO I AM.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; NOW, Gideon was out there threshing his
[1:34:16] wheat, no doubt, but the prophet's
[1:34:17] message was going through his heart.
[1:34:18] What the prophet said, "I am the God of
[1:34:20] Abraham, Isaac. I am the one that
[1:34:21] brought you out of Egypt. I'm the one to
[1:34:23] give you what you you've got. Turn to
[1:34:24] me." And there his father out there
[1:34:26] threshing wheat. And the angel came to
[1:34:27] him. Oh, aren't you glad the angel comes
[1:34:30] to where you're at?
[1:34:35] Aren't you glad he come right where the
[1:34:36] widow where where the um oh woman the
[1:34:38] whale he came right where she was at
[1:34:42] AND THE CONDITION YOU'RE IN DOESN'T
[1:34:44] CHANGE WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT YOU.
[1:34:47] OH, let that sink in for JUST A MINUTE.
[1:34:49] YOU MIGHT BE SCARED IN CHURCH TONIGHT.
[1:34:51] YOU MAY HAVE WALKED IN HERE WITH ALL
[1:34:52] KINDS OF FEAR, BUT WHY [screaming] DON'T
[1:34:54] YOU LISTEN TO THE WORD OF THE LORD
[1:34:55] TONIGHT? THE WORD OF THE LORD IS SAYING
[1:34:57] YOU ARE A MIGHTY WARRIOR. BUT BROTHER
[1:35:00] MAN, I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT. I DON'T
[1:35:03] CARE WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE. WHY DON'T YOU
[1:35:04] LISTEN TO WHAT GOD IN THIS MESSAGE IS
[1:35:06] CALLING YOU TO? HE'S AWAKENING A BRIDE.
[1:35:09] HE IS BRINGING. HE IS SAYING, "COME BACK
[1:35:12] TO ME, MY PEOPLE. YOU ARE [screaming] MY
[1:35:15] INVINCIBLE ARMY."
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; Not you will be. Now
[1:35:20] listen, we're not waiting on something.
[1:35:26] The devil will talk you into that. Well,
[1:35:27] if you just wait. If you just wait.
[1:35:29] Yeah. Brother man was 12 years old and
[1:35:30] waited. He said it was cloud cloud hung
[1:35:32] over to him and he waited to give his
[1:35:34] heart to the Lord. Wish he'd never done
[1:35:35] it. Why don't you quit waiting? Young
[1:35:37] person, why don't you quit waiting? Old
[1:35:40] person, why don't YOU QUIT WAITING? YOU
[1:35:41] KNOW, whether you got the baptism of the
[1:35:43] Holy GHOST OR NOT, QUIT ACTING LIKE IT.
[1:35:44] LET'S GET IT FOR [screaming] REAL.
[1:35:48] Come on, somebody. This ain't time to
[1:35:50] play church. Listen, listen. Have you
[1:35:51] not heard the message? Come here. Do you
[1:35:53] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost? Do
[1:35:54] you have the seal of God? DO YOU HAVE
[1:35:56] THE HAVE YOU NOT HEARD IT? LISTEN,
[1:35:58] LITTLE BRIDE, IT'S [screaming] TIME TO
[1:36:00] GO. IT'S TIME FOR ACTION.
[1:36:06] And he spoke to Gideon. And Gideon was a
[1:36:08] little surprised. He said, "Now, mighty
[1:36:10] man man of valor, he didn't know who he
[1:36:15] was."
[1:36:19] Now, a lot of you identify Gideon right
[1:36:20] now, don't you? You think, "Brother
[1:36:22] Matt, but why would I have this? Why
[1:36:25] would I have this problem? Do you
[1:36:26] recognize that's nothing but a devil
[1:36:28] trying to hide you back? Where's the
[1:36:31] greatest battle ever fought?
[1:36:35] And it seems so real.
[1:36:42] You guys have mind bells, right? All
[1:36:44] right. Devil good at his job. He knows
[1:36:48] how to paint a picture of you that all
[1:36:49] you can see is nothing but negative. And
[1:36:52] you can come up this far, but you can't
[1:36:53] go all the way.
[1:36:56] Well, I'm here to cut that devil's head
[1:36:57] off and say that's not who you are. You
[1:37:00] are of the ones You are of the caliber
[1:37:02] that goes all the way. You are of THE
[1:37:04] CALIBER THAT MARCHES ON. WE'RE CHRISTIAN
[1:37:06] SOLDIERS. YOU ARE THE ONE THAT TOES THE
[1:37:08] LINE WITH THIS MESSAGE. YOU DON'T TRY TO
[1:37:10] WATER IT DOWN. YOU DON'T TRY TO SAY,
[1:37:11] "WELL, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID, BUT I'M
[1:37:12] GOING TO DO THIS." NO, YOU SAY WHAT HE
[1:37:14] SAID. YOU DID WHAT HE SAID. IT'S THUS,
[1:37:17] SAYETH THE LORD, SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART,
[1:37:19] AND YOU [screaming] KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
[1:37:20] IT. YOU PUT ACTION BEHIND IT.
[1:37:26] HE SAID, he said he didn't know who he
[1:37:28] was. Maybe you don't know who you are.
[1:37:30] You might be many of those mighty men of
[1:37:31] value tonight sitting here. You say the
[1:37:33] little church, small group. Oh my.
[1:37:34] There's only two of them here. Him and
[1:37:37] his daddy. There was only two here. You
[1:37:39] and Christ. And that's all it takes to
[1:37:41] be a mighty man of our
[1:37:45] How many thankful you've had your
[1:37:47] meeting with you in Christ? But let me
[1:37:50] ask you, you had your meeting, but have
[1:37:51] you backed off of it?
[1:37:58] It's easy to get complacent.
[1:38:00] I felt God move in church. Uhhuh. That's
[1:38:02] great. I danced. Praise the Lord. But
[1:38:06] are you taking this sword
[1:38:10] and taking some devil's heads off? This
[1:38:13] ain't just for brother Ron to do. I know
[1:38:15] he'll do it. Amen. I know brother Angel.
[1:38:18] They ain't afraid of any devil. Listen,
[1:38:19] you know what that instills in you? The
[1:38:21] same thing that's in them. It's the same
[1:38:23] God leading them and it's LETTING YOU
[1:38:24] KNOW WHY ARE YOU AFRAID? WHY ARE YOU
[1:38:26] BACK DOWN? LISTEN, GIDEON, YOU DON'T
[1:38:28] HAVE TO BE BACK DOWN. I GAVE YOU MY
[1:38:30] WORD. NOW ACT UPON [screaming] MY WORD,
[1:38:37] 19 minutes.
[1:38:42] This message came to identify the bride.
[1:38:48] I know a lot of you even right now
[1:38:50] there's complexes in the hangover your
[1:38:52] life and you think man Matt this is so
[1:38:55] good but could it really really be me?

[1:39:08] one day this is your day.
[1:39:13] Quit waiting.

[1:39:17] be like the first. Amen. They'll get the
[1:39:19] same results. You may have come in the
[1:39:20] last hour, but this is your time to
[1:39:22] fight.
[1:39:25] Don't let the de I know there's a fight
[1:39:26] in you.
[1:39:28] Turn it back on the devil and let him
[1:39:31] have it.
[1:39:34] Come on, SAINTS OF GOD. WHY DON'T YOU

[1:42:54] you thankful?
[1:42:57] We just don't take everything we feel."
[1:43:00] Gideon took the angel of the Lord and
[1:43:01] said, "Now wait a minute.
[1:43:03] If that be true and you're calling me
[1:43:06] who you say you are, I don't think so.

[1:43:26] preach it. I'm gonna go through the
[1:43:27] quotes. I got them all. You want it?
[1:43:28] I'll send it all to you. You can have
[1:43:29] it. But let said this. He says, "You got
[1:43:31] to become a miracle in order to see a
[1:43:33] miracle." You know what the greatest
[1:43:34] miracle there is? A new birth. How
[1:43:37] many's got a new birth tonight? Well,
[1:43:40] why don't you stand to your feet? Say,
[1:43:41] "It's me. I've got a new birth." HE'S
[1:43:44] IDENTIFIED IN MY LIFE. I AM BORN AGAIN,
[1:43:47] SAVED, filled with the Holy Ghost. Now,
[1:43:48] sit down. I'm not DONE YET. S. HE SAID,
[1:43:50] "I AM BORN AGAIN." [screaming]
[1:43:55] EXERCISE. You guys need some blood flow
[1:43:57] change. Some of you about ready to get a
[1:43:58] blood clot. Oh, praise the Lord. All
[1:44:02] things happen for a reason.
[1:44:05] Sounds good. Anyway,
[1:44:08] if you have a new birth, you're in
[1:44:11] possession of the greatest miracle.
[1:44:15] You're in possession of what he came
[1:44:17] for. You're in possession of the baptism
[1:44:19] of the Holy Ghost. And it rings down on
[1:44:21] the inside of your heart. And the devil
[1:44:23] is trying to cow you down from it and
[1:44:25] say, "You can't be that type of warrior.
[1:44:27] You can't be LIKE DAVID. BUT WHY WOULD
[1:44:29] GOD PREACH IT FROM THIS PULLPIT? TAKE
[1:44:31] YOUR WARFARE. TAKE YOUR LIKE DAVID.
[1:44:33] YOU'RE LIKE GIDEON. YOU ARE. WHAT IS HE
[1:44:35] TRYING TO IDENTIFY? HE'S AWAKENING
[1:44:37] [screaming] A WARRIOR.
[1:44:43] [sighs]
[1:44:46] I got to read this one. He says, "No, 13
[1:44:48] minutes." He says, "Now Gideon,
[1:44:50] countdown. Now Gideon, those people
[1:44:53] there before they could see or could
[1:44:54] ever go see these miracles of God, there
[1:44:56] was a condition they had to meet. They
[1:44:58] had to meet to see the power of
[1:45:00] miracles, they had to believe. They also
[1:45:02] had to believe and obey the prophet's
[1:45:04] word to see the miracles of God.
[1:45:07] Ah, you didn't catch it. You got to
[1:45:09] believe what this prophet said.
[1:45:14] Quit watering it down and quit making
[1:45:17] excuses for yourself.
[1:45:21] Well, preach, brother man. Come on,
[1:45:23] SOMEBODY. THE BIBLE SAID, "GIVE NO
[1:45:25] EXCUSES FOR YOUR FLESH.
[1:45:30] What idol you got?"
[1:45:34] Glory.
[1:45:39] He says, "Before we can see miracles,
[1:45:40] God, we've got to obey." The prophet
[1:45:41] said, "The Bible is a prophet to us."
[1:45:43] That's right. If a man, no matter how
[1:45:44] much he calls himself God's prophet of
[1:45:46] the Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostal,
[1:45:47] whatever may be, whoever he calls
[1:45:48] himself, if his word isn't living in
[1:45:50] him, he isn't a prophet. He might be a
[1:45:53] prophet, but a false one. True prophets
[1:45:55] speak this true word and then put God
[1:45:58] just exactly the same God, the same
[1:46:00] power, the same word, the same
[1:46:02] everything, the true word. LET ME ASK
[1:46:04] YOU, did William, Mary, and Brandham
[1:46:06] speak the same word?
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SOMEBODY WAKE UP. WAKE UP. I
[1:46:13] MEAN IT FOR REAL TONIGHT. WAKE UP.
[1:46:15] [screaming] WHAT ARE YOU FOLLOWING? YOU
[1:46:17] ARE FOLLOWING THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[1:46:20] AND IT'S IDENTIFYING WHO [screaming] YOU
[1:46:23] ARE.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; I think brother William read this a
[1:46:33] while back. He says, "We find out those
[1:46:35] people who are the weakest and rejected
[1:46:38] by the outside world is God's heroes.
[1:46:42] I pray we just tore some devils down
[1:46:44] right there. I know some of you think,
[1:46:46] "I'm just the weakest nobody." And the
[1:46:47] devil plants that seed in your head and
[1:46:49] you begin to feed that thing because you
[1:46:51] got every excuse of why you're the
[1:46:52] weakest somebody and you can't ever do
[1:46:54] any of this and you're afraid to pray
[1:46:55] over somebody. QUIT BEING AFRAID. THAT'S
[1:46:58] WHAT THE MESSAGE COME FOR. TO INTRODUCE
[1:47:01] YOU TO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD,
[1:47:02] [screaming] TO INTRODUCE YOU TO CHRIST
[1:47:04] THAT IT WOULD TAKE THE SCARE AWAY.
[1:47:11] LISTEN, what would catch this? What
[1:47:13] would Gideon say? And he said unto him,
[1:47:15] "Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
[1:47:17] Israel? Behold, my family
[1:47:21] is poor
[1:47:23] in Manasseh, and I'm the least in my
[1:47:26] father's house."
[1:47:28] Well, that's me. Well, good.
[1:47:31] You're identified with Gideon.
[1:47:34] Why don't you start believing like
[1:47:35] Gideon did? Gideon was a little bit
[1:47:37] scared and he had to give a fleece out
[1:47:39] here and a fleece out here. HE WANTED TO
[1:47:40] MAKE SURE IT WAS THE WILL OF THE LORD.
[1:47:42] BUT GIDEON GOT TO THE PLACE WHEN GOD
[1:47:44] [screaming] SAID IT, HE JUST BELIEVED
[1:47:45] IT. WHY DON'T WE GET TO THAT PLACE
[1:47:48] TONIGHT? IF GOD SAID I'M HEALED, I'M
[1:47:50] HEALED. IF GOD [screaming] SAID I GOT
[1:47:51] THE HOLY GHOST, I GOT THE HOLY GHOST. IF
[1:47:53] GOD SAID I WAS DELIVERED, I'M DELIVERED.
[1:47:55] IF I'M FREE, I'M FREE. [screaming]
[1:47:58] BELIEVE WHAT THE WORD OF GOD SPOKE OVER
[1:48:00] YOU. IF YOU'RE A SINLESS, SPOTLESS
[1:48:02] BRIDE, THEN IDENTIFY AND WALK IN IT.
[1:48:05] DON'T CONDEMN [screaming] SOMEBODY. JUST
[1:48:07] BE THE LIGHT.
[1:48:11] Let me finish. I got nine minutes. Keep
[1:48:15] me, aren't you? I'm a little timeer
[1:48:16] right there.
[1:48:19] Gideon would begin to choose his
[1:48:21] warriors.
[1:48:23] And he would follow the war the
[1:48:25] leadership of God. And he got down to
[1:48:27] the first place. Listen, God's warriors
[1:48:29] can't be scared.
[1:48:33] Let me tell you, perfect love casts out
[1:48:35] fear. So, if you would recognize how
[1:48:37] much God actually loves you tonight,
[1:48:40] every fear would leave you.
[1:48:44] All right, reach over and grab your
[1:48:45] wife, husband's hand, child, grab your
[1:48:47] mom and dad's. How much love is
[1:48:49] representative right there? All right,
[1:48:51] you guys can hold hands. You You're
[1:48:53] brothers in Christ. It'll be all right.
[1:48:59] Guys look weird. No.
[1:49:02] set him up, didn't I? How much love is
[1:49:05] identified
[1:49:07] right here. Look at this marriage.
[1:49:11] Been through many ups and downs, many
[1:49:13] valleys, but I guarantee you right now,
[1:49:15] they love each other more than they ever
[1:49:18] loved each other. Sister Whitney, am I
[1:49:20] right? It gets sweeter as the days go
[1:49:23] by. I thought when I walked down the
[1:49:24] aisle, I'd love her more than I ever
[1:49:26] did. I held her hand the other week in
[1:49:29] Pennsylvania. I said, "Honey, I love you
[1:49:31] now more than I ever love you." And let
[1:49:34] me tell you, this bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:49:36] God loves you more now than he ever
[1:49:39] loved you. His love, I believe, is
[1:49:40] growing for you day by day by day by
[1:49:43] day. He is God and he changes not. But
[1:49:45] his love for you, it grows for you.
[1:49:51] But that maybe I'm mentioning, but I I
[1:49:53] believe if my love can grow for my wife,
[1:49:56] and that's a spiritual type. Amen. the
[1:49:58] natural types of spiritual. I believe
[1:50:00] God
[1:50:02] is saying, "All right, come away." I
[1:50:04] wish brother Donnie here. Come away,
[1:50:08] my bride.
[1:50:17] Quit being scared.
[1:50:23] But brother Matt, I've failed so many
[1:50:24] times.
[1:50:26] His grace is sufficient.
[1:50:30] His mercy endureth forever. Brother
[1:50:34] Matt, you know how many times I messed
[1:50:35] up this week?
[1:50:37] You still here?
[1:50:43] He said he never leave you nor forsake
[1:50:46] you. And I have found him to be true and
[1:50:50] faithful over and over and over again
[1:50:55] when I would have left myself.
[1:50:58] Come on, somebody. How many of you has
[1:50:59] given up on yourself? Said, "God, you
[1:51:01] should really give up on me. YOU DO. YOU
[1:51:04] KNOW ME." YES. YOU'RE A mighty warrior.
[1:51:07] YOU'RE A MIGHTY MAN OF VALOR. I DON'T
[1:51:10] SEE YOU FOR YOUR MISTAKES. I DON'T SEE
[1:51:12] YOU FOR BEING SCARED. I SEE YOU FOR WHO
[1:51:14] YOU ARE. AND YOU ARE MY PRIDE.
[1:51:16] [screaming] YOU ARE MY ARMY. AN
[1:51:18] INVINCIBLE ARMY.
[1:51:22] God's warriors don't bite idols.
[1:51:27] I already hit it way ago. If that's your
[1:51:31] idol tonight, why don't you just repent?
[1:51:36] If your idol is you,
[1:51:41] I know
[1:51:44] sticky,
[1:51:46] but just be honest with yourself. Say,
[1:51:48] Lord, I'm sorry.
[1:51:50] I've bowed to what I wanted. Lord, help
[1:51:54] me to do better. Father, I hear your
[1:51:57] voice in this end time. Father, I want
[1:51:59] to do what you want me to do. And
[1:52:01] Father, all I can say is here I am.
[1:52:02] Father, I put my hands in your hands. I
[1:52:05] put this clay in your life. Mold me and
[1:52:08] make me. Fashion me into a vessel of
[1:52:10] honor for you.
[1:52:13] Musicians come. You love him. Five
[1:52:15] minutes, honey. Good.
[1:52:19] I want you to catch this right now. This
[1:52:21] hit me the other day and I like to have
[1:52:23] a fit.
[1:52:25] I be to look at Gideon's army.
[1:52:28] and get his army ended up being 300 men,
[1:52:31] which to any rightful person looks
[1:52:34] crazy. If you took Brother Gabe, Brother
[1:52:37] Josh, Brother Alen, Brother Adam, and it
[1:52:40] was me against them, that's four against
[1:52:42] one.
[1:52:44] I'll be honest, I don't think I'd last
[1:52:45] more than three seconds. I'm a big guy,
[1:52:47] but man, I tell you what, one of them
[1:52:48] gets their hand on me, it over.
[1:52:53] You got to say, I'm into that. It's all
[1:52:55] right. I'm not that guy.
[1:52:59] But it was 300. What was What were the
[1:53:02] odds? The odds were 300 men to 135. 450
[1:53:08] to one.
[1:53:12] You might have one word of God and you
[1:53:14] got 450 thoughts and ideas and feelings
[1:53:17] coming against it.
[1:53:21] Listen, we fight not against flesh and
[1:53:22] blood, but you got every thought coming
[1:53:24] against that one word of God. Why don't
[1:53:26] you take that one word of God and draw
[1:53:28] your sword to say, "The word is right.
[1:53:30] The word is right. This message is true.
[1:53:32] I am a warrior. I am who he said I am.
[1:53:35] I'm called to win. I'M CALLED TO
[1:53:36] OVERCOME. I'M CALLED TO be what he said
[1:53:40] I would be."
[1:53:44] Brought it down to reality. To me, so
[1:53:46] many times you think of Samson clearing
[1:53:48] a thousand men. And it's like, if we
[1:53:50] could ever see that, you see one man and
[1:53:54] a thousand set up before it. I know
[1:53:56] sometimes you have 1500 thoughts coming
[1:53:59] against the fact that you have the
[1:54:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost. But why don't
[1:54:04] you sit there and say, "Lord, you called
[1:54:06] me. You've done this work, Father. You
[1:54:09] started this work. You'll finish this
[1:54:11] work, Father. I'm not packing down. I'm
[1:54:13] not
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; cut your way through." How many loves
[1:54:19] him tonight?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:26] Hallelujah.
[1:54:29] How many's ready to fight?
[1:54:31] I did my job like a pep rally.
[1:54:36] Come on, baby. Let's go win
[1:54:41] that fight you've had at home. [music]
[1:54:43] Why don't you go win it now? Come on.
[1:54:46] You know it's going to meet you on
[1:54:48] Tuesday.
[1:54:50] You be looking for it. Say, "I got you."
[1:54:52] Say, "But man, I don't have anything to
[1:54:54] fight with." Begin to listen to these
[1:54:55] messages. [music] You got plenty to
[1:54:58] fight with.
[1:55:00] But man, I never remember it. The Bible
[1:55:02] says he'll [music] bring all things to
[1:55:03] your remembrance. Then why are you
[1:55:05] scared of when you stand against that
[1:55:08] devil? You got nothing to be scared of.
[1:55:10] In fact, that devil's already shaking
[1:55:11] his books in hell because he knows he's
[1:55:13] assigned to you on Tuesday. And he
[1:55:15] knows, you know what? if they ever TRULY
[1:55:17] GET IT. I AM DON'T WANT TO GO.
[1:55:23] You love him.
[1:55:25] Let me play. How great is [music] our
[1:55:28] God? Isn't he great?
[1:55:31] How great
[1:55:33] is our God? Oh, sing with me. How great
[1:55:38] [singing]
[1:55:39] [music] is our God and all will see how

[1:56:18] all names. Oh, he's worthy [singing] of
[1:56:24] our [music] praise.
[1:56:26] My heart will sing. How
[1:56:29] [music and singing] great

[1:56:54] tonight.

[1:57:00] is our [singing] God. [music]
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; How great is our God. And all will see.
[1:57:09] How great.
[1:57:12] How [music] great
[1:57:14] is our One more time. How great. Oh,
[1:57:17] [music] how great
[1:57:19] is our God. Oh, sing with me. How
[1:57:23] [singing] great
[1:57:25] is our God. And all will [music] see how
[1:57:29] great
[1:57:30] how great
[1:57:33] our [music and singing] God.
[1:57:37] Hallelujah.
[1:57:38] Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] Let's pray together.
[1:57:43] Maybe tonight you're you still think,
[1:57:45] "Well, brother Matt, that's good, but
[1:57:48] how could it be me?"
[1:57:51] Say, "Father,
[1:57:53] won't you pass by my way? Won't you
[1:57:56] vindicate to me, Father, over and over
[1:57:59] again,
[1:58:03] I am who you said I am.
[1:58:07] Father, Lord, you see the hands that are
[1:58:09] raised, Father.
[1:58:12] God, I pray for each one of us now,
[1:58:13] Father. God, I pray that you'd pass by
[1:58:16] our way, God. God, that you'd make this
[1:58:19] so real to us, Father, that we'd
[1:58:21] identify who we are, Father. God, not we
[1:58:24] will be, but right now who we are.
[1:58:27] Father, you've called us to this,
[1:58:28] Father. We didn't call oursel, Father,
[1:58:31] but God, you made us, Lord. You've
[1:58:33] pressurized us, Father, to be able to
[1:58:35] handle it, Father. So, Father, I pray
[1:58:37] right now.
[1:58:39] Touch each one. Let it become real,
[1:58:42] Lord. I pray let their eyes come open.
[1:58:45] May they see the workings of the devil,
[1:58:47] how he works in their life, how he tries
[1:58:49] to bring them down, Father. And may they
[1:58:51] not just see that, but God, may they
[1:58:53] take their sword. May they take this
[1:58:55] message, Father, and may they begin to
[1:58:57] cut through, Lord God, into liberty,
[1:58:58] [music] into freedom, Lord God. May they
[1:59:00] come into a unity with you, Father. God,
[1:59:03] that they would be with you alone,
[1:59:04] Father, ministering to their needs.
[1:59:08] Lord, we love you tonight. Bless each
[1:59:11] one.
[1:59:12] Jesus [music] name. Amen.
[1:59:20] The earth [music] rejoice.
