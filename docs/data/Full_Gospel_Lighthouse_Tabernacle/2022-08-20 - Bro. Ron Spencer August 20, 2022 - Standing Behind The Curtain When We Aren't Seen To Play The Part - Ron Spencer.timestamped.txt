[50:13] would like to report to you on Wednesday
[50:15] we received a report that the brain
[50:17] tumors are stable
[50:19] and one of these days they're going to
[50:21] tell me they're gone and so we just
[50:23] believe that with all of our hearts and
[50:25] so
[50:28] oh man
[50:30] no new metastasis is there and so we're
[50:32] just thankful amen so we we'd be good
[50:36] boys we take our chemo we keep going we
[50:39] keep marching forward keep believing
[50:41] God's good at his word and so we just
[50:43] we're not we're not a bit disappointed
[50:46] we just keep going right forward and
[50:48] they've changed a couple medicines for
[50:50] me and so you pray that I can tolerate
[50:52] them as I go through it and uh it's just
[50:55] part of the journey but God's God give
[50:58] us the strength to do this and so amen
[51:01] he knew it before it ever came maybe
[51:03] even in this sermon you can kind of hear
[51:05] some of what I've went through
[51:08] because God ordained it to allow it that
[51:11] the music would sound a certain way
[51:14] amen
[51:16] Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 1.
[51:19] you may hear this this scripture a lot
[51:22] of times from the henceforth going
[51:24] forward but I want to read it so many
[51:26] times until the devil gets tired of
[51:28] hearing me read it
[51:32] who hath believed our report into whom
[51:34] is the arm of the Lord revealed
[51:36] for he shall grow up before him as a
[51:39] tender plant and as a root out of dry
[51:41] ground
[51:42] he hath no form of calmliness and when
[51:45] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[51:47] we should desire him
[51:49] he is despised and rejected of men a Man
[51:53] of Sorrows and acquainted with grief I
[51:55] love that word and acquainted with grief
[51:59] and he and we hid as if were our faces
[52:03] from him he was despised that we'd
[52:05] esteemed him not
[52:07] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[52:10] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[52:13] him
[52:14] stricken and smitten of God and
[52:16] Afflicted but he was wounded for our
[52:19] transgressions
[52:20] he was bruised for our iniquities the
[52:23] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[52:26] and with his stripes we are healed
[52:31] there will never come a time that this
[52:33] scripture won't become important to you
[52:36] amen God bless you you can be seated
[52:40] last Sunday we spoke to you on an
[52:43] orchestrated
[52:46] orchestrated
[52:48] place
[52:51] orchestrated lives for an orchestrated
[52:53] place
[52:54] and in the coming weeks that will even
[52:57] become even more important to you of how
[52:59] important that service was literally
[53:02] when I was pulling up the driveway this
[53:04] afternoon a brother from Texas brother
[53:06] Jeremy from Texas
[53:08] wrote me and told me how much that that
[53:11] service meant to him just really spoke
[53:14] to his Hearts tonight I'd like to speak
[53:16] to you on standing behind the curtains
[53:21] when we're not seeing
[53:23] and we're still playing the part
[53:28] because God molds us
[53:31] in a way
[53:32] to be able to play the part
[53:36] sometimes we look at other people
[53:38] and might even would like to be like
[53:41] them but you got to remember this
[53:44] you got to go through what they've went
[53:46] through
[53:48] [Music]
[53:50] to be like them
[53:52] and there's sometimes you don't want to
[53:55] go through what somebody else goes
[53:57] through
[53:59] oh but I want to be like that person but
[54:01] you don't understand what they've had to
[54:03] go through in their life
[54:06] sometimes it's unseen sometimes it's
[54:08] never told it's the Untold Story
[54:11] you might hear a Fanny Crosby
[54:14] and the phenomenal writer that she was
[54:18] I shall know him I shall know him I
[54:21] shall know him by the nail prince in his
[54:23] hands
[54:25] she was an extremely poor woman
[54:28] blind
[54:30] sense of very early birth
[54:33] let me just say this to you
[54:36] during the time of the Civil War
[54:40] she was offered much monies
[54:43] to be political and write songs for the
[54:46] political parties she could have used
[54:48] that money
[54:50] she could have used maybe the fame that
[54:52] would go along with that
[54:54] but she chose God
[54:58] she chose God and and choosing God is
[55:01] always the right answer and when she
[55:04] chose God no doubt a lot of people made
[55:07] fun of her a lot of people laughed and
[55:11] scorned why would she live such a backup
[55:14] honorable life
[55:15] why would she do that when she could
[55:18] have had a lot of incredible money
[55:22] but let me just say this your greatest
[55:24] reward
[55:26] of the testimony of Jesus Christ in our
[55:30] lives
[55:31] there was a sister from Florida her name
[55:34] was sister Brenda Lewis
[55:36] she's one of our most famous message
[55:38] songwriters
[55:40] she was extremely poor
[55:43] extremely poor but yet God gave her some
[55:47] of the greatest songs
[55:50] that could be pinned to paper
[55:52] and they said when they went and cleaned
[55:54] her house out that there was songs
[55:57] little little pieces of songs on every
[56:00] piece of paper newspaper pictures there
[56:03] was pieces of song when inspiration
[56:05] would come she would just start writing
[56:09] I'd say she spent a lot of time with God
[56:13] she spent a lot of time with
[56:14] fellowshipping with God she may not have
[56:17] been a preacher but she allowed that
[56:19] gift of that fellowship with God to so
[56:22] overflow in her life
[56:25] yet being poor yet having a lot of
[56:28] physical issues not being able to stand
[56:31] the last years of her life let me just
[56:33] say this you she did not let it deter
[56:38] one of her strongest songs that I
[56:40] listened to much it's gonna take a
[56:42] stronger wind than this
[56:45] Hallelujah
[56:48] Hallelujah brother Aaron Oglesby would
[56:51] preach a sermon that's one of my
[56:53] favorite Services of his when he would
[56:55] preach a sermon when I was diagnosed of
[56:58] cancer it's going to take a stronger
[57:01] wind than this
[57:09] brother says you you'll have to go
[57:12] through your ups and downs
[57:14] don't worry you've got to go through
[57:16] some Briar patches
[57:18] over some sharp rocks over Bluffs down
[57:22] hillsides up through the mountains over
[57:25] Waters
[57:27] walk with God
[57:31] there's so many Hills to climb
[57:36] they're upwork
[57:38] some of them are difficult
[57:41] how little it'll seem
[57:43] when you get to the end of the way
[57:46] brother man said listen I'm going to say
[57:48] something to you
[57:50] faith is unconscious
[57:52] he said you believe it he said I've
[57:55] learned that in the years of travel
[57:57] through the world and the meeting of
[57:58] peoples of of the different walks
[58:01] faith is unconscious
[58:04] you got to have faith you got faith and
[58:06] you don't know it
[58:07] that's right
[58:09] Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a
[58:12] storm or the Gale was knocking the boat
[58:15] from one side to the other or he was
[58:18] standing in the face of a mess of demons
[58:20] he was hanging anywhere he said it never
[58:24] moved him
[58:25] he walked right on just as calm and as
[58:28] quiet as he could be
[58:30] he was simply unconscious of fear
[58:34] anything around him
[58:37] he said whether it was going to happen
[58:39] or whether it wasn't going to happen he
[58:41] noted was going to happen because God
[58:43] said so he said so
[58:47] he didn't say I wonder if I need to pray
[58:49] through I prayed through I wonder if I
[58:52] fasted long enough I wonder if I did
[58:54] this I wonder if I've walked right on
[58:56] unconscious he believed what God Said
[59:00] was truth
[59:01] the words must be fulfilled he knowed
[59:05] what his life was to fulfill them and he
[59:10] said that's right
[59:12] and if you're here now notice he turns
[59:15] it to you and if you're here to fulfill
[59:17] it too just walk unconscious of him
[59:21] walk unconscious of criticism walk
[59:24] unconscious of the world
[59:26] walk as you walk in Christ walk with him
[59:30] pay no attention to the left or the
[59:33] right hand just keep moving on
[59:37] if something comes up into church walk
[59:40] with God
[59:41] if sickness strikes you walk with God
[59:45] this is a powerful sermon hang right
[59:47] with it now
[59:48] he said if the neighbor don't like you
[59:51] walk with God just keep walking with God
[59:55] this is good this good nuts bolts just
[59:58] walk with God
[1:00:02] Enoch walk with God
[1:00:05] and one day he took a walk home
[1:00:08] huh
[1:00:09] Enoch one day walk with God
[1:00:12] you know what he done he walked all the
[1:00:14] way home with God
[1:00:16] got so far up the road
[1:00:18] he didn't want to come back anymore
[1:00:22] walk with God the doctor says you're
[1:00:25] going to die walk with God
[1:00:34] Hallelujah
[1:00:36] I can preach that that quote stands in
[1:00:38] my ears
[1:00:41] one night the doctor one of the lady
[1:00:43] doctors came into my room and she sat
[1:00:46] down on the side of my bed and sister
[1:00:47] Connie was laying laying in the couch
[1:00:50] laying in the whatever couch there was
[1:00:52] there to sleep beside me
[1:00:56] and we were to prepare to have
[1:00:59] have
[1:01:01] another brain surgery
[1:01:04] she walked in and she sat down and she
[1:01:06] talked to me she said they've told you
[1:01:08] that you've got just a few months to
[1:01:09] live and I said yeah
[1:01:12] she said but I feel like that I'm the
[1:01:15] sickest patient in the room
[1:01:20] she said I need what you've got
[1:01:25] she talked to me about what the last
[1:01:27] days would might be like
[1:01:32] none of them had an idea that I would
[1:01:34] stand here two and a half years later
[1:01:36] still preaching
[1:01:49] you see that's our God
[1:01:53] and doctors want to help you that's
[1:01:55] that's what they want to do they want to
[1:01:57] help you
[1:01:58] and they want to they want to help
[1:02:00] humanity and dying Humanity try to make
[1:02:03] tomorrow better for you they've done a
[1:02:05] lot of wonderful things for me but let
[1:02:07] me just say the god that we serve
[1:02:10] he is a faithful God
[1:02:14] you're going to have some bad days
[1:02:15] you're going to have some difficult
[1:02:18] moments in your life get back up
[1:02:21] get up don't lay down get up
[1:02:26] it may hurt to get up but get up
[1:02:30] it may be difficult to walk through
[1:02:32] tomorrow it may be difficult what you've
[1:02:34] got to go through just keep getting up
[1:02:37] [Applause]
[1:02:50] brother Brandon says now notice again
[1:02:53] when all hell turns loose
[1:02:56] all Heaven turns loose
[1:02:59] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:03:02] spirit of God raises up a standard
[1:03:05] against it
[1:03:08] there would have been no rainbow until a
[1:03:10] flood came
[1:03:12] but after Noah was pressed into that
[1:03:15] condition that he was in to float 40
[1:03:17] Days A Night in the storm and the little
[1:03:20] Ark pitching up and down in the water it
[1:03:23] was after the flood was over that he saw
[1:03:26] the rainbow for the first time
[1:03:30] the Covenant of Hope
[1:03:34] the Covenant of promise
[1:03:36] he had went through a tribulation
[1:03:40] but then he saw the Covenant
[1:03:44] he saw the promise let me just say this
[1:03:48] to you God's big enough
[1:03:52] he's big enough if he makes a promise
[1:03:54] he'll keep it
[1:03:59] when he told us in Isaiah 53 when he
[1:04:03] told us in Isaiah 53 he'd be our Healers
[1:04:07] he knew that he was coming
[1:04:10] and he would be beaten like no other man
[1:04:12] would be beaten
[1:04:15] because you and I Adam had fell and
[1:04:18] throwed the whole human race into a
[1:04:22] fallen condition but God provided a lamb
[1:04:27] not a lamb of some man God came himself
[1:04:31] [Applause]
[1:04:32] providing lamb the blood that could take
[1:04:36] away the sins of the world
[1:04:40] amen
[1:04:45] Psalms chapter 34 and verse 19.
[1:04:50] many
[1:04:53] I want you to read this scripture with
[1:04:55] me many are the afflictions of the
[1:04:59] righteous

[1:05:20] all
[1:05:23] we can dismiss right now and just go
[1:05:25] ahead and Shout for a while
[1:05:26] [Applause]
[1:05:34] brother Brown said why does God let
[1:05:36] troubles come
[1:05:40] God harnesses troubles
[1:05:43] punch bits in its mouth makes it obey
[1:05:47] him and those troubles bring us into
[1:05:51] closer fellowship with God
[1:06:00] your troubles get you closer to God
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:10] Hallelujah and remember
[1:06:13] God's got the control
[1:06:18] he won't let Satan go too far
[1:06:24] he won't even let him come and take you
[1:06:26] home
[1:06:27] one day early
[1:06:30] until your purpose is finished on this
[1:06:32] Earth

[1:07:25] knows your end

[1:07:34] of the Lamb he has prepared a new city
[1:07:36] for you

[1:13:18] should not be a fool
[1:13:19] I will say the truth but now I forbear
[1:13:22] lest that any man
[1:13:25] should think about of Me Above measure
[1:13:28] see if me to be or of Hearth of me
[1:13:31] unless I should be exalted above measure
[1:13:35] through the abundance of the revelations
[1:13:36] there was given to me
[1:13:39] a thorn in the flesh a messenger of
[1:13:43] Satan here is the first church age
[1:13:46] messenger
[1:13:49] and he's just being very honest
[1:13:52] God allowed the devil
[1:13:55] to put a thorn in my flesh
[1:13:58] that I would not get exalted
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:09] it says Buffett that word Buffett means
[1:14:12] he would be buffeted for a bit and it
[1:14:15] would leave

[1:14:21] especially in the fall
[1:14:23] and here it comes it leaves you all year
[1:14:26] long and then all of a sudden you've got
[1:14:29] a cold that won't leave you
[1:14:32] through the night you're sniffling
[1:14:35] you're being buffeted
[1:14:38] by an allergy condition
[1:14:41] when I was a little boy
[1:14:44] went to school I would go to school and
[1:14:47] I had allergies that would literally
[1:14:49] swell my eyes shut and I hear brother
[1:14:52] Raymond talk about grease mom would
[1:14:54] take uh not lard but but it was Lord it
[1:14:58] was Crisco and she'd take Crisco and put
[1:15:00] it on my eyes and pull my eyes apart
[1:15:04] and I would go to school and I would
[1:15:06] sneeze and sneeze and sneeze and and and
[1:15:09] and and I was redheaded so and I was the
[1:15:12] littlest guy in the classes so people
[1:15:14] would pick on me
[1:15:15] and then then one day we were taken to
[1:15:18] the doctor
[1:15:20] and and the doctor gave me a
[1:15:22] antihistamine
[1:15:25] and it was a activate
[1:15:27] it was the initial appeal to come back
[1:15:30] that
[1:15:30] you were to take one at night and one in
[1:15:33] the morning so I slept good all night
[1:15:37] and I slept good all day
[1:15:38] [Laughter]
[1:15:48] Paul had a condition in his eyes
[1:15:52] it's been debated throughout history of
[1:15:55] what the condition was caused by
[1:15:58] but it was a condition that can you
[1:16:00] imagine standing preaching the gospel of
[1:16:03] a God that heals a God that saves a God
[1:16:06] that cast out Devils that should be
[1:16:09] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:16:11] Christ that these signs shall follow
[1:16:13] them that believe
[1:16:14] and he was standing there with pus
[1:16:16] running down out of his eyes you see God
[1:16:19] knows how to mold the player
[1:16:23] to be able to play in the orchestra
[1:16:27] that he won't do it with his own will he
[1:16:30] will only do it by the will of God
[1:16:32] [Applause]
[1:16:37] notice his words for this thing I
[1:16:40] besought the Lord Thrice
[1:16:43] that it might depart from me
[1:16:46] and he said unto me
[1:16:48] my grace
[1:16:51] is sufficient
[1:16:54] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:16:56] weakness
[1:16:58] now his response Paul has a response
[1:17:00] most gladly therefore I would rather
[1:17:03] glory in mine infirmities
[1:17:05] that the power
[1:17:07] of Christ
[1:17:09] May rest upon me
[1:17:13] notice these next words this is a
[1:17:15] difficult to listen to therefore I take
[1:17:17] pleasure in my infirmities
[1:17:20] in reproaches
[1:17:22] in necessities
[1:17:24] in persecution in distress for Christ's
[1:17:27] sake for when I am weak
[1:17:34] let me just say we can't do this on our
[1:17:36] own
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:40] we can't do this on our own but when I
[1:17:43] am weak
[1:17:45] when I would give up then I am strong
[1:17:57] First Peter chapter 1 and verse 7.
[1:18:01] the trial of your faith
[1:18:07] First Peter 1 7. the trial of your faith
[1:18:11] being more much more precious than of
[1:18:15] gold that perisheth
[1:18:18] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:18:21] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
[1:18:25] the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:18:29] remember Abraham
[1:18:32] God knew who Abraham was
[1:18:35] but Abraham didn't know who he was
[1:18:41] God knew who Abraham was but Abraham
[1:18:45] didn't know who he was
[1:18:52] the scripture says in Isaiah chapter 43.
[1:18:57] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[1:18:59] Theo Jacob and he that formed the O
[1:19:02] Israel fear not
[1:19:05] notice these next words
[1:19:08] I have redeemed thee
[1:19:11] I have called thee by thy name and thou
[1:19:14] art mine you wasn't looking for God God
[1:19:18] was looking for you
[1:19:21] are you with me now oh my brother Ron I
[1:19:24] got myself here no no no no no no no no
[1:19:26] no no no no no no no no no no
[1:19:29] no no
[1:19:31] none of us have got ourselves here it
[1:19:33] was God rich in Mercy
[1:19:37] [Applause]
[1:19:41] many of you are a one out of a family or
[1:19:44] one out of a job or one out of a school
[1:19:49] and God raised you up for a purpose to
[1:19:52] play a part in God's Orchestra
[1:19:56] and whether you know it or not you are
[1:19:59] playing with people around the world
[1:20:03] you may never meet them in this life but
[1:20:06] one day you'll meet them there and you
[1:20:08] have played in a symphony
[1:20:12] not one above Another We're
[1:20:14] complementary to one another
[1:20:19] Brethren but I'm in a storm I want you
[1:20:22] to say these words with I am coming out
[1:20:24] of this storm
[1:20:29] I am coming out of this storm
[1:20:34] I want to just bring you some basics of
[1:20:36] this
[1:20:37] before the storm ever come
[1:20:41] before the lightning ever struck before
[1:20:44] the darkness ever came around you before
[1:20:47] the clouds ever assembled God knew you
[1:20:50] was getting ready to go through it
[1:20:58] if you're gonna have difficulties in
[1:21:00] your life before you ever get to your
[1:21:01] difficulty
[1:21:07] remember
[1:21:09] the devil in all of his hints are only a
[1:21:12] toolbox
[1:21:15] never get the devil a whole lot of
[1:21:18] credit never show him any Mercy
[1:21:23] he's only a toolbox
[1:21:26] you don't worship your toolbox
[1:21:30] it's got screwdrivers it's got hammers
[1:21:33] it's got crowbars
[1:21:38] and so that toolbox is used to mold
[1:21:41] character in your life
[1:21:49] now think about this Michelangelo
[1:21:52] worked on a piece of Rock
[1:21:55] because Moses was in there nobody else
[1:21:59] saw Moses in that rock
[1:22:02] many people passed by and saw
[1:22:04] Michelangelo working huge piece of Rock
[1:22:08] what are you working on I'm working on
[1:22:10] Moses
[1:22:12] you're standing there you didn't see
[1:22:14] Moses
[1:22:16] but Moses was in there
[1:22:19] the man with the vision all he had to do
[1:22:22] was get the excess off of him
[1:22:29] are you with me all he had to do was get
[1:22:32] the excess off of him
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:34] that's what God does to you he's just
[1:22:37] getting the mud off of you and the dirt
[1:22:39] off of you and he's washing the excess
[1:22:42] off of you I'm not talking about your
[1:22:43] weight now he's he's just getting the
[1:22:47] sins off of your life the attitudes off
[1:22:49] of your life why does he have to do that
[1:22:52] here because you can't do it in the
[1:22:54] Rapture mode so you got to get ready
[1:22:56] here to go play that
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:08] thank you
[1:23:15] now God has a promise with you
[1:23:19] and sometimes your ship may be breaking
[1:23:22] apart
[1:23:23] God don't have a promise with the ship
[1:23:26] he has a promise with you
[1:23:32] your job might be just tearing apart and
[1:23:35] literally leaving you the promise ain't
[1:23:37] with your job or your company it's with

[1:24:23] stands trouble
[1:24:29] why don't you just go ahead and say say
[1:24:30] that right there my God understands
[1:24:33] trouble

[1:24:39] devil the next time that you have a
[1:24:41] difficult day with him my God
[1:24:43] understands trouble and the trouble of
[1:24:46] this day is only temporary tomorrow will

[1:24:59] bumblebee I might be throwing up but my
[1:25:01] saying is tomorrow we'll be better
[1:25:08] God knows the end
[1:25:17] sister Connie he knows the end
[1:25:22] from the beginning
[1:25:25] um
[1:25:28] when you came here
[1:25:29] you didn't understand a lot of things
[1:25:33] what has Greg got me into
[1:25:39] but this ain't the end
[1:25:41] this is just another journey in your
[1:25:43] life another chapter
[1:25:46] and now we got to get busy to play our
[1:25:48] part
[1:25:50] we just got to get busy I don't want to
[1:25:52] waste a day I don't want to waste a week
[1:25:54] I don't want to waste a month
[1:25:57] oh
[1:25:59] are you with me when the lights come on
[1:26:01] and the orchestra's playing I want to be
[1:26:03] in my seat I want to be ready
[1:26:08] let me just say this to you it's work
[1:26:13] training is work people that run in an
[1:26:16] olympic race they work to get there they
[1:26:20] don't accidentally get there you don't
[1:26:22] accidentally run a four minute mile
[1:26:26] a concert pianist they have to play over
[1:26:30] and over and over every day the same
[1:26:33] peace
[1:26:35] they gotta work until their muscle in
[1:26:38] their fingers have a have a memory of
[1:26:41] where to go at the next piece
[1:26:46] it's work they don't just accidentally
[1:26:48] walk up and say well I'm going to play
[1:26:49] Beethoven it's work to do that
[1:26:53] when you hear a preacher preach and he's
[1:26:55] preaching it didn't take two weeks to
[1:26:58] get that sermon together it took his
[1:27:00] entire lifetime
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:09] find it amazing that people can
[1:27:11] criticize you as a preacher they've
[1:27:13] never won one soul
[1:27:16] they've never been baptized one
[1:27:18] individual
[1:27:20] they've never went out of their way for
[1:27:22] the cause of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:27:24] but yet they can tell you how to do it
[1:27:30] but there have been sin along as your
[1:27:33] Briar for the day
[1:27:44] and if that fellow's watching tonight
[1:27:46] that was for you
[1:27:49] [Applause]
[1:28:05] now you've got a promise
[1:28:09] these statements are coming out of God's
[1:28:12] provided way about 10 different sermons
[1:28:15] so you just stay with me
[1:28:17] you got a promise
[1:28:20] but you must keep your focus
[1:28:25] when difficulties come
[1:28:28] you got to keep your focus
[1:28:31] you got a part to play you got a mission
[1:28:34] to play you got a job to play you got a
[1:28:36] role to play
[1:28:38] God's put you here in laodicea to
[1:28:40] overcome laodicea
[1:28:49] there's going to be times in your storms
[1:28:51] you're going to lose some stuff
[1:28:54] brother Brandon lost a lot of friends in
[1:28:56] his life preaching the truth
[1:28:59] do we hear him quit
[1:29:02] we hear Paul say Demas has forsaken me
[1:29:06] loving this pleasure of this world
[1:29:08] brother bam said demons love to hear his
[1:29:11] name called
[1:29:13] that's what he said
[1:29:14] brother man had friends that walked away
[1:29:16] from him after he preached certain
[1:29:18] truths
[1:29:19] certain doctrines men would walk away
[1:29:22] from him
[1:29:23] they were friends
[1:29:27] you're going to lose some friends in the
[1:29:29] storm
[1:29:31] but ask yourself
[1:29:34] was they really
[1:29:36] your friend
[1:29:43] this is not everybody's going to walk
[1:29:45] you through you to the end
[1:29:51] listen if they can walk away
[1:29:56] they didn't value your friendship
[1:30:01] so they pretended for that length of
[1:30:04] time to be your friend
[1:30:06] and then when the little Shuffle comes
[1:30:08] all of a sudden they gone don't blame it
[1:30:11] on me baby I'm still standing here
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:25] tell a lot of things on me let me just
[1:30:27] say this you I've been here all this
[1:30:29] time I'll be here till the rapture
[1:30:32] I will still be preaching this truth
[1:30:36] I have nothing to hide I'm as
[1:30:38] transparent as I can be I'm as real as I
[1:30:41] can be
[1:30:58] brother Ron that was pretty rough
[1:31:00] well let me give you the words of my
[1:31:02] predecessor
[1:31:07] he said on your way out don't let the
[1:31:11] door hit you in the butt
[1:31:13] [Applause]
[1:31:28] now for people all over the world maybe
[1:31:30] in Europe or in we're in the fighting
[1:31:34] part of Heaven
[1:31:37] we will have your back when nobody else
[1:31:40] will have it
[1:31:42] we will make a lot of noise here
[1:31:43] praising the Lord that just put your
[1:31:46] Stones away
[1:31:48] God's raised us up here for a purpose
[1:31:59] and I ain't changed for nobody and I
[1:32:01] ain't gonna change for you baby
[1:32:04] [Applause]
[1:32:09] well if so and so comes in you won't
[1:32:11] preach as hard let me just say if so and
[1:32:13] so comes in they're going to have to get
[1:32:14] the same dose I've been preaching since
[1:32:16] out in 1984. I've been preaching this
[1:32:21] I Ain't No rookie
[1:32:23] [Applause]
[1:32:30] the reason you're still standing
[1:32:33] if God knows that you can handle the
[1:32:35] pain
[1:32:41] because you know his grace is sufficient
[1:32:51] you've lost a lot of temporary things
[1:32:53] you might say
[1:32:55] brother Danny steamman called it stuff
[1:32:58] and fluff
[1:33:04] life is not perfect
[1:33:09] in case you haven't figured this out
[1:33:11] life ain't perfect
[1:33:15] brother but I'm telling us this there's
[1:33:17] no church perfect
[1:33:18] so if you leave looking for a perfect
[1:33:20] church when you get there it's not going
[1:33:23] to be perfect no more
[1:33:25] that's not my statement that's been
[1:33:27] around for a while but it's good enough
[1:33:29] I'll use it
[1:33:33] you're not perfect
[1:33:36] somebody somebody just put you you're
[1:33:39] not perfect
[1:33:44] oh bro Ron I'm perfect look in the
[1:33:46] mirror baby
[1:33:51] I'm gonna get married my mate's gonna be
[1:33:53] perfect
[1:34:00] young ladies that are not married today
[1:34:03] you're dreaming of a perfect mate
[1:34:06] I want to give you just a little piece
[1:34:08] here
[1:34:10] one day I asked your daddy for a
[1:34:12] chainsaw
[1:34:15] get your daddy to start it up
[1:34:19] put it on the bed beside of you
[1:34:20] preferably
[1:34:22] with a with a canvas under it
[1:34:25] now lay down and go to sleep
[1:34:30] [Applause]
[1:34:41] I had a friend of mine his name is Milko
[1:34:46] I'd heard it so many times that milco
[1:34:49] was a great snorer
[1:34:53] I did not know it to being in
[1:34:55] Switzerland
[1:34:56] and he was in the floor below
[1:34:59] concrete building
[1:35:01] 12 inches of concrete between me and him
[1:35:05] besides the six foot to the bed
[1:35:09] I put pillows on my head and it didn't
[1:35:11] work I turned the fans on it didn't work
[1:35:14] I finally just turned brother Branham on
[1:35:17] and
[1:35:18] turned it loud enough tall he drowned it
[1:35:21] off Milko
[1:35:23] but milco during the day was one of the
[1:35:26] most lovable teddy bears that you ever
[1:35:29] ever ever known
[1:35:32] you would never say a word about him
[1:35:36] but let that baby go to sleep
[1:35:46] I just dropped that in because I could
[1:35:48] drop a lot of stories right here
[1:35:52] everybody loves brother Terry's work
[1:35:55] brother Terry is a perfectionist in his
[1:35:57] work
[1:35:59] but if you've never heard his story
[1:36:01] about being an orphan child
[1:36:03] about being left alone if he talks to
[1:36:06] you about 30 minutes about his life
[1:36:08] story that's what made him who he is
[1:36:14] it will leave you in tears it is the
[1:36:17] Untold Story
[1:36:19] he needed the queen bee
[1:36:26] he needed somebody that would love him
[1:36:29] and nurture him and take care of him
[1:36:36] tell him that right now you go ahead and
[1:36:38] tell him man right now that's right
[1:36:43] life is not Hollywood
[1:36:47] News Bulletin life ain't Hollywood
[1:36:55] so many times we're in love with what we
[1:36:58] had
[1:36:59] and for Christians many times they they
[1:37:02] want the devil wants to take them back
[1:37:04] to the good old days then what good old
[1:37:07] days
[1:37:09] I I don't know what kind of days you had
[1:37:11] but them wasn't good old days back there
[1:37:13] in sin
[1:37:15] it was God rich in Mercy
[1:37:18] that kept you from running off of the
[1:37:20] side of the road and killing yourself it
[1:37:22] was God rich in Mercy that your drives
[1:37:25] wasn't at least with fentanyl and you
[1:37:28] died in the middle of the night
[1:37:30] it was God rich in Mercy that you didn't
[1:37:34] wind up with the wrong woman or the
[1:37:36] wrong man for life
[1:37:39] somebody ought to be helping me right
[1:37:41] now
[1:37:50] but the devil's always want you to look
[1:37:53] back
[1:37:54] you need a swivel on your head to turn
[1:37:56] you around and look forward and press
[1:37:59] forward and move forward
[1:38:02] we don't drive looking back we don't run
[1:38:05] looking back we don't walk looking back
[1:38:08] we are Christians and we March forward
[1:38:27] not going to get done but I'm going to
[1:38:29] just share a couple more things with you
[1:38:31] when the doctor tells you you're gonna
[1:38:33] die
[1:38:35] whose report do you believe
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:39] you can choose to fall into that report
[1:38:41] because that's what they see
[1:38:43] scientifically or you can read God's
[1:38:45] word
[1:38:48] and if it don't leave in a day or two or
[1:38:50] don't leave in a week or two just keep
[1:38:52] walking if it don't leave in a year or
[1:38:55] two keep walking

[1:39:16] couple things
[1:39:18] I have been sent every alternative
[1:39:21] medication that you can be sent
