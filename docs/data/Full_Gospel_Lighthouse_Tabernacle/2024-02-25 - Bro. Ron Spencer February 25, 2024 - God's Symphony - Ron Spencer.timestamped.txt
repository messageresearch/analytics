[52:26] I want to just kind of ramble just for a
[52:29] moment if it would be okay
[52:32] amen this week something very special
[52:34] happened and I've given a lot of
[52:38] thought sister Chassidy had um had been
[52:43] adopted is this okay to tell I'm going
[52:46] to
[52:47] anyway sister chassid had been adopted
[52:50] into a wonderful family and I'm talking
[52:53] about wonderful family they were she was
[52:55] taken care of By
[52:57] Angels and so uh they were deeply loved
[53:01] we love them
[53:03] personally sister nise good to see you
[53:05] girl good to have you
[53:08] back and sister Chassidy got got word
[53:13] and was it a week or
[53:19] so she got a
[53:21] call and they begin to ask her this man
[53:24] begin to ask asked her what was her name
[53:27] kind of some background he said I think
[53:30] of your
[53:32] brother and we have a
[53:36] sister and so you got to meet them I saw
[53:40] the
[53:42] pictures and so when I saw the picture I
[53:45] I said that's
[53:48] definitely I'm sorry about the sister
[53:50] but I said that's definitely from the
[53:52] same
[53:54] bull
[53:57] amen that's what I
[53:59] said and as I begin to think about this
[54:03] now I want to bring every one of you
[54:04] into this I've been in China I've been
[54:08] all over
[54:09] Europe I've been throughout the
[54:10] Caribbean I've been in a lot of places
[54:12] I've been in New Zealand Australia a lot
[54:14] of places all over
[54:16] Canada and when I meet somebody for the
[54:19] first time I believe I can say this for
[54:22] you there's just a
[54:25] an attachment you don't know why you
[54:30] can't describe it but you feel like you
[54:33] found a part of
[54:35] yourself maybe for decades we haven't
[54:38] had this conversation so I'm just going
[54:40] to move him and so for decades you found
[54:43] yourself kind of missing a part of
[54:46] you and in just a matter of
[54:50] minutes a lot of questions are answered
[54:53] and that's by not by having a
[54:54] conversation
[54:56] but by that like
[54:59] spirit so when I get off of a plane and
[55:02] there's hundreds of people that are
[55:04] there I got off a plane in in Nashville
[55:08] one time and and there was a girl that
[55:10] got on and she was had a bodyguard that
[55:13] was with her and she got on the plane
[55:15] and she sat down beside of me she never
[55:17] said hello she curled up put the belt on
[55:22] and she curled up and went to sleep a
[55:25] immediately and when got off there was
[55:28] flowers on the floor and roses
[55:31] everywhere and there was a big placard
[55:34] it wasn't for
[55:36] me it was for the girl that sat beside
[55:39] of me and I didn't know I was sitting
[55:43] beside of a celebrity and uh and she was
[55:47] getting ready to get a Grammy award that
[55:49] night and and there was limousines
[55:52] waiting outside and all of that
[55:54] different kind of thing and I come to
[55:56] find out you know I rode with Taylor
[56:01] Swift I had no idea I didn't know who
[56:04] she
[56:05] was and she was a teenage phenomenon and
[56:08] I I didn't I never heard her music
[56:11] matter of fact I've still haven't heard
[56:12] her
[56:15] music and you know what meeting her
[56:18] didn't mean too much to
[56:21] me but I walked around the corner and
[56:23] there was a brother that said brother
[56:27] Ron and in a
[56:29] moment I felt that family
[56:33] feeling in a
[56:36] moment we were driving down out of
[56:40] service uh maybe a few months
[56:43] ago and and you guys had stopped on the
[56:47] side of the hill and I said
[56:49] Connie go back go
[56:53] back there they're real Believers go
[56:56] back they're part of our family I want
[56:58] to shake their hands I I want to tell
[57:00] them thank you for coming brother and
[57:02] sister seab breze let me just say this
[57:04] to you we came from
[57:10] God we came from God and we're going to
[57:13] go back to
[57:15] God and we're family here and we're
[57:19] family all over the
[57:21] world now many of them are different
[57:24] than what we are are some of noisy some
[57:26] are quiet and some are this way or some
[57:29] are that way but we all came from
[57:33] God we all came from God and we get
[57:37] around one another and after a little
[57:39] while we begin to discover that
[57:42] godlikeness about us
[57:44] all now it's that Humanity that we
[57:47] sometimes have difficulty with and but
[57:50] we realize that we are God has placed
[57:54] something to reflect like a star in our
[57:58] lives and we're reflections of him when
[58:01] we first begin to serve the Lord we'll
[58:03] we'll we'll discover more about
[58:05] ourselves and you know in the world we
[58:09] we couldn't get satisfied sin just
[58:11] couldn't satisfy us but it's just like
[58:15] when you serve God God just so fills you
[58:18] up and and he fills you up and he fills
[58:21] you up and and you want to be back in
[58:23] service and you want to be with one
[58:26] another an enemy will try to drive uh uh
[58:31] uh a vice between one another because he
[58:35] knows together we're
[58:39] stronger together we're stronger so
[58:42] whether it's a family or whether it's a
[58:44] church or where it's a multimember
[58:47] across the world it is Satan that tries
[58:51] to draw something between you because
[58:54] because he
[58:56] knows
[58:59] together together sure there'll always
[59:02] be differences but together when you can
[59:05] get those that difference out of the
[59:11] way I'm drawing from a background when I
[59:14] was about 18 years old and I was a
[59:16] senior probably 17 at that time and I
[59:19] was in a I was I was selected to be a
[59:22] special special part of the school or
[59:25] the county that where we was in and it
[59:27] was two from every school and I was
[59:29] selected to be one of them and they took
[59:32] us to Washington they did that on a few
[59:34] different kind of times and then some of
[59:37] them call it Governor school or whatever
[59:39] but they they took us to Washington and
[59:42] and on both occasions they they took us
[59:45] to an orchestra and was the national
[59:48] orchestra that was played and I didn't
[59:51] know much about it but one time that we
[59:53] went there and they were playing Peter
[59:55] and the
[59:58] Wolf you ever hear brother brandom talk
[1:00:00] about Peter and the
[1:00:02] Wolf and and they were playing this
[1:00:04] Orchestra I'm a country boy I've been
[1:00:07] raised on a farm I'm in a class of 33
[1:00:13] people and uh you know and so anyway
[1:00:17] they take us there and then they move us
[1:00:19] to another place it's a theater and in
[1:00:22] that theater I'll never forget it it was
[1:00:24] a these things kind of stick in my mind
[1:00:27] it was a it was a theatrical event and
[1:00:31] it was an event called much ad do about
[1:00:35] nothing and I thought what in the world
[1:00:38] why am I sitting here and then the next
[1:00:41] theater was about the great
[1:00:43] Renaissance and so that was that was
[1:00:46] that was quite an interesting thing but
[1:00:48] but I thought what will I need in my
[1:00:50] life to know about much to do about
[1:00:53] nothing
[1:00:56] actually there was a TV series that came
[1:00:58] out many years later called
[1:01:01] Seinfield and it was much to do about
[1:01:06] nothing much to do about nothing and I
[1:01:09] think sometimes as Christians the enemy
[1:01:12] gets our eyes focused on that's right
[1:01:17] much a do about
[1:01:23] nothing
[1:01:25] I've often asked myself the question and
[1:01:27] so here we go I've often asked myself
[1:01:30] the question what was I doing watching a
[1:01:35] symphony on couple different
[1:01:38] occasions I'm 62 years old now one of my
[1:01:42] pastimes and one of the things that I do
[1:01:44] to go to sleep is I listen to Symphony
[1:01:48] and you go brother Ron but you're a
[1:01:49] country guy yeah but there's something
[1:01:51] on the inside of me that just kind of
[1:01:53] likes that
[1:01:55] that and then when I begin to study the
[1:01:57] message and and I begin to realize
[1:02:00] brother brandham is preaching in Yuma
[1:02:02] Arizona or he's preaching or in
[1:02:06] California or he's preaching over here
[1:02:08] in in Canada and and he's preaching all
[1:02:11] over the world whether it's in Finland
[1:02:13] or whether it's in Switzerland or in
[1:02:15] definitely in Jeffersonville or wherever
[1:02:18] he's preaching all of those sermons are
[1:02:21] linked
[1:02:22] together amen and it's kind of like the
[1:02:26] Bible 40 different
[1:02:30] writers none of them would hardly know
[1:02:32] one another but they were all inspired
[1:02:36] by the same
[1:02:39] writer and it would each one complement
[1:02:42] one another and brother brandom would
[1:02:45] say in Christ The Mystery of God and
[1:02:47] also other sermons he say if you can't
[1:02:50] read Jesus Christ in every
[1:02:53] scripture read it
[1:02:56] again and so when I begin to look at the
[1:02:59] services that we are involved in and
[1:03:02] many times our services here are like a
[1:03:04] convention service and every one of them
[1:03:07] is linked one to
[1:03:09] another and every one of them if you'll
[1:03:11] pay close attention has got a part for
[1:03:14] you inside of that service it's not a
[1:03:18] man that's doing any of that it's God
[1:03:21] that is doing
[1:03:22] that maybe I'll get to it again and I
[1:03:25] was just relooking at some of these
[1:03:27] things but I was looking at a a sermon
[1:03:30] that I preached before cancer and it
[1:03:32] says the
[1:03:34] hurt cannot hurt the music
[1:03:38] amen the hurt that you're going through
[1:03:42] will not stop the music that you have so
[1:03:46] I can look at it standing on this side
[1:03:48] four years later and say all of the hurt
[1:03:52] that we have went through with can
[1:03:54] answer has not deterred the
[1:03:59] music of Our Lives now if you remember
[1:04:03] there's a few things that I want to drop
[1:04:04] to you brother randam in the vision of
[1:04:07] the the bride coming into preview and
[1:04:10] then the last one he was watching I'm
[1:04:12] going to I'm just going to stay on the
[1:04:13] bride not the church world but in the as
[1:04:16] they begin to March as ladies and
[1:04:18] they're going forward and he was so
[1:04:21] pleased to see how that they were
[1:04:23] marching one in the back kind of kind of
[1:04:25] got out of step and he began to scream
[1:04:28] get back in
[1:04:30] line get back in line get back and step
[1:04:34] they were marching and he would sing the
[1:04:36] song many times in his ministries Onward
[1:04:40] Christian
[1:04:41] Soldiers let me just say this to you all
[1:04:44] of us whether it's in brother bram's
[1:04:46] meetings the mighty angel came down to
[1:04:49] this bride of Jesus Christ that a that
[1:04:52] Angel's still here Among Us
[1:04:54] we're under the influence of that Mighty
[1:04:58] angel now let me just say every one of
[1:05:01] us have to surrender our ambition to God
[1:05:06] brother BR we use a sermon called Paul a
[1:05:09] prisoner of Jesus Christ he would
[1:05:13] surrender himself now as a
[1:05:16] Christian we know longer want our own
[1:05:19] will cuz our will and our choices took
[1:05:21] us away from God and we realize that our
[1:05:25] our choices took us out in the world and
[1:05:28] did a lot of different things but by
[1:05:30] predestination and the election and the
[1:05:32] adoption of God God comes
[1:05:35] in and I I I don't know if you're at
[1:05:38] this stage yet or not but maybe when you
[1:05:40] were younger it felt like don't do don't
[1:05:44] do don't do you must not do you must do
[1:05:47] this you must do that and it was almost
[1:05:50] somebody like a somebody beating you
[1:05:52] with a
[1:05:53] hammer
[1:05:54] come
[1:05:55] on but if you ever fall in love with
[1:05:58] [Applause]
[1:06:00] God you don't want to do anything that's
[1:06:02] wrong you just want to be right you just
[1:06:06] want to love him you just want to please
[1:06:08] him you want to you just want to be a
[1:06:10] part of his program whether he's at
[1:06:14] that's where I want to
[1:06:17] be Jesus would even pray this and I I'll
[1:06:20] share this with you and after this
[1:06:22] manner therefore pray you our
[1:06:25] Father which art in Heaven Matthew
[1:06:28] chapter 6 and verse 9 Our Father which
[1:06:31] art in
[1:06:33] heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:06:37] name let's read it together thy kingdom
[1:06:41] come thy will be done in earth as it is
[1:06:45] in heaven give us this day our daily
[1:06:48] bread and forgive us of our debts as we
[1:06:51] forgive our debtors and lead us not into
[1:06:55] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:06:58] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:07:02] the glory
[1:07:06] forever brother Steven he prayed not my
[1:07:09] will but thy will be
[1:07:12] done he could have had a family he could
[1:07:15] have had a
[1:07:16] church he could have had the kingdom
[1:07:18] himself he was offered to United States
[1:07:21] he could have had all of those things
[1:07:24] because the king of this world was
[1:07:26] offering it to
[1:07:27] him but you was on his
[1:07:31] mind brother Vernon down through time
[1:07:34] six Church ages you was on his mind
[1:07:36] seven Church ages you was on his mind
[1:07:38] 6,000 years he's looking down through
[1:07:41] looking at time seeing
[1:07:43] you if he takes his own will he loses
[1:07:48] you now notice just for a basis brother
[1:07:52] Braham said his
[1:07:54] word is like a great
[1:07:57] Symphony and how many of ever heard of a
[1:08:00] symphony you know when I begin to study
[1:08:02] the message I brother
[1:08:07] brandham a
[1:08:10] symphony and he says well everybody has
[1:08:13] now remember a symphony is when music is
[1:08:17] played in a
[1:08:18] drama I think I have it right a symphony
[1:08:21] Peter and the Wolf and you remember that
[1:08:25] the old Story how they used to I've
[1:08:27] heard that how that they would take the
[1:08:29] drums and make the little woodpecker
[1:08:32] pecking and Peter going out and the
[1:08:34] growling of the wolf and the toting of
[1:08:36] the horns a
[1:08:39] symphony notice how he begins to just
[1:08:42] bring us all into it he says now if you
[1:08:44] don't understand a
[1:08:46] symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to
[1:08:50] you said brother Ron i' just rather hear
[1:08:53] some Blu grass
[1:08:54] well isn't it great that God made us all
[1:08:56] different am Hallelujah now you got to
[1:09:00] understand what it is it's all done by
[1:09:04] signs and motion but it acts like a
[1:09:08] drama in this Symphony and we notice the
[1:09:12] only one that understands a symphony is
[1:09:15] a
[1:09:16] composer and those who are interested in
[1:09:19] knowing it knows its changes knows what
[1:09:23] it taking place now the
[1:09:26] composer knows every move move from the
[1:09:31] end to the beginning he's the one who
[1:09:33] writes it and he says he said he he said
[1:09:38] the one who wrote it up he composes it
[1:09:43] and he knows every little Junction and
[1:09:46] it's important that you get the
[1:09:47] Junctions right and if he knows every
[1:09:50] Junction so does the
[1:09:52] director
[1:09:54] the director has to know every move he
[1:09:58] said to direct it he says now how are
[1:10:01] you going to twist a Creed or or one
[1:10:04] little miscue of a stick and a sign and
[1:10:07] one little missign at a junction would
[1:10:09] throw the whole Orchestra off he said
[1:10:12] throw the whole Symphony out he said now
[1:10:15] you know that's true the
[1:10:17] composer and the director has to be in
[1:10:21] the same
[1:10:22] spirit
[1:10:24] are you with me now let's just lay out
[1:10:27] some let's just lay out some Basics
[1:10:30] here now the director that is going to
[1:10:34] direct maybe the national Orchestra he
[1:10:37] has to pick a
[1:10:39] piece that he's inspired by now whether
[1:10:43] it's Bach or Beethoven or any of the
[1:10:47] other great composers of
[1:10:50] History they have a they have a way that
[1:10:53] they they want this
[1:10:55] plate and the director when he chooses a
[1:10:59] part and he chooses maybe a an hour or
[1:11:03] two hour pieces to
[1:11:09] do he doesn't have a right to
[1:11:12] misinterpret
[1:11:15] it he doesn't have a right to rewrite
[1:11:19] it he has to keep it in the spirit of
[1:11:22] the way it's written
[1:11:24] there's a way that it's got to sound
[1:11:27] there's a way that it's got to be
[1:11:30] done and so he begins with the
[1:11:33] music and he begins to pick the greatest
[1:11:39] musicians in the world to play the
[1:11:44] part and and then the music or the
[1:11:48] instruments that they're playing they're
[1:11:50] not just some 10 cent
[1:11:52] piece
[1:11:54] they are the best pieces of horn or
[1:11:59] violin or flute or the drum they just
[1:12:04] don't go get yard sell
[1:12:06] pieces but they begin to bring and and
[1:12:10] every one of those
[1:12:12] musicians every one of them are gifted
[1:12:16] in
[1:12:17] life to be able to bring the best out of
[1:12:21] that
[1:12:22] instrument
[1:12:25] they're gifted in a certain way maybe
[1:12:28] some by a learned
[1:12:30] experience but most likely most of them
[1:12:33] have a gift that they were born in on
[1:12:36] the inside of their hearts like an
[1:12:39] artist or a poetry writer or a a real
[1:12:43] bride of Jesus
[1:12:46] Christ now these instruments being of
[1:12:49] the highest quality they've got to be
[1:12:51] taken care of
[1:12:54] and these men that that are gifted to be
[1:12:57] able to play ladies being able to
[1:13:00] play when they play the
[1:13:04] music they begin to bring that music to
[1:13:09] life maybe that music is 400 years old
[1:13:13] but it's still a
[1:13:15] masterpiece so now just laying in book
[1:13:18] form it'll lay dormant but if they can
[1:13:22] take their their part and they can
[1:13:25] realize I've got a part to play in this
[1:13:28] and they begin to bring that
[1:13:30] 400 that 400 year old music and bring It
[1:13:37] Forward are you with me they begin to
[1:13:39] bring it forward now listen a
[1:13:44] masterpiece is actually a piece of a of
[1:13:47] a composer's life he's actually poured
[1:13:51] his life in it no doubt he'll write
[1:13:53] thousands of pieces of music and be
[1:13:55] known for
[1:13:59] one it's like a
[1:14:01] preacher or like a songwriter or like a
[1:14:05] a
[1:14:06] singer many times great singers only
[1:14:09] produce one number one
[1:14:12] hit many preachers when they begin to
[1:14:15] preach they'll preach thousands of
[1:14:17] sermons but there'll be one that will be
[1:14:22] elevated even brother brandham will call
[1:14:24] the
[1:14:25] token his
[1:14:28] Masterpiece so you understand kind of
[1:14:30] what I'm saying right there now when
[1:14:34] that person is beginning to bring this m
[1:14:37] music forward they're bringing a gift on
[1:14:44] display sorry I'm just taking it just a
[1:14:47] bit
[1:14:49] now whether you're an organ player or
[1:14:52] where you're a guar player or are they
[1:14:54] your drunk player you're expressing a
[1:14:57] gift that is with from inside of
[1:15:02] you a
[1:15:04] preacher whether you preach to the
[1:15:07] nursing home or you preach
[1:15:11] conventions that's really not your
[1:15:14] gift that's God's Gift in
[1:15:20] you are you with me
[1:15:25] now whether it was
[1:15:27] Abraham or Noah or Elijah or nahome or
[1:15:32] even David when God begin to write about
[1:15:35] their
[1:15:37] lives you know God was quite wonderful
[1:15:42] in some of those places he wrote about
[1:15:44] their negative
[1:15:48] part or we would think we had to be
[1:15:52] angels can you imagine how difficult it
[1:15:54] was for Moses to write about himself
[1:15:56] having a high
[1:16:01] temper chassity when you met your
[1:16:03] brother the other day you didn't walk up
[1:16:05] to him in the first two minutes and go
[1:16:07] well there's some things that you're not
[1:16:08] going to like about
[1:16:10] me one's my
[1:16:15] [Applause]
[1:16:21] husband whether it was Joseph or David
[1:16:25] or Tamar or Ruth they were all
[1:16:29] displaying a part of
[1:16:34] God and your life whether you realize or
[1:16:38] not living right now in
[1:16:40] 2024 you are actually displaying a part
[1:16:44] of
[1:16:47] God are you with me you're more than
[1:16:50] just a
[1:16:51] name you're Christ on display well
[1:16:55] brother Ron I'm I'm 6 years old but your
[1:16:58] Christ on display as a
[1:17:01] six-year-old as a teenager you young
[1:17:04] ladies that are sitting here young men
[1:17:06] that are sitting here you're Christ at
[1:17:08] your
[1:17:09] age you're not a preacher or some some
[1:17:12] singer somewhere or another but you're
[1:17:14] Christ in school you're Christ on the
[1:17:16] job you're Christ with your
[1:17:20] friends are you with me now we
[1:17:23] instructed that we can't add to it or we
[1:17:25] can't take away from it we're instructed
[1:17:29] that we must keep the word pure and keep
[1:17:32] it holy and keep our lives that way I
[1:17:36] begin to look at some practices of
[1:17:38] procedures about about about Symphonies
[1:17:42] and the organizations of
[1:17:44] Symphonies and and to be a part of it
[1:17:47] and sister Cassie you're welcome to
[1:17:48] correct me if you if you would like to
[1:17:50] do that but
[1:17:54] if there is a vacancy in the National
[1:17:57] Symphony and they put forward that we
[1:18:00] need a a
[1:18:02] Pianist and and so what they do is they
[1:18:05] begin to send out word throughout the
[1:18:07] world we would like to have a a Pianist
[1:18:10] we'd like to have a certain pianist and
[1:18:13] and what they do
[1:18:14] is is they have blind
[1:18:18] auditions and then the blind auditions
[1:18:21] brother Jordan you're ahead of me stay
[1:18:23] with
[1:18:25] me and in the blind auditions they don't
[1:18:28] want to see your face right and they
[1:18:31] don't want to know who you are they
[1:18:34] don't want the appearance of your
[1:18:37] Humanity to affect their
[1:18:39] decision right of who can play the music
[1:18:43] the
[1:18:45] best and you will compete with thousands
[1:18:48] of people whether you know it or not so
[1:18:51] you have to make sure that you and the
[1:18:54] music are
[1:18:57] one that you and the music are one so
[1:19:00] when I
[1:19:02] hear I'll just use it like this when I
[1:19:04] hear Cassie play it isn't Cassie's
[1:19:07] opinion of the
[1:19:10] peace or her theory of the peace it's
[1:19:14] the
[1:19:15] peace and Cassy are
[1:19:20] one brother Brandon went to see uh and
[1:19:23] this might sound uh kind of new to you
[1:19:26] but brother random went to see the Ten
[1:19:28] Commandments 11
[1:19:30] times because he didn't go to see
[1:19:32] Charleston
[1:19:35] hon he went to see Charleston hon had so
[1:19:39] laid himself aside until now Charleston
[1:19:43] hon was not himself anymore but now he
[1:19:49] Moses so when he steps out there gets
[1:19:52] the red see it's not Charleston hon it's
[1:19:57] Moses and this is little known fact but
[1:20:00] Charleston hon after the Moses was
[1:20:03] finished and the work was done and it
[1:20:05] was complete Charleston hon didn't know
[1:20:08] who Charleston hon
[1:20:10] was he had so stepped into the
[1:20:15] role Ron stay inead stay stay stay stay
[1:20:19] quiet for a minute Charles and hon had
[1:20:22] still stepped into the role he wasn't
[1:20:24] even himself
[1:20:26] anymore he was
[1:20:28] Moses and so he had to go to a facility
[1:20:32] to get himself called back to find out
[1:20:36] who he was so he could disattach himself
[1:20:40] from
[1:20:44] Moses you like it you like that so let's
[1:20:48] build a little bit more before we go too
[1:20:50] much further so
[1:20:54] each one of these individuals
[1:20:56] life so let's just say that Cassie wins
[1:21:00] the
[1:21:02] part so sister Cassie would be go to the
[1:21:06] National Orchestra and she would begin
[1:21:08] to
[1:21:09] play
[1:21:12] now 300 people is what I understand
[1:21:15] about 300 people are
[1:21:17] playing Cassie is not over top of all
[1:21:20] the 300 people she is
[1:21:23] complimentary to the rest of
[1:21:28] them now Cassie has got to find her
[1:21:31] place in the part it's got to find her
[1:21:35] place now it's phenomenal she's now been
[1:21:38] selected but now she's got to find her
[1:21:40] place and her
[1:21:42] position now they don't all get together
[1:21:46] 365 days a year to practice so they got
[1:21:49] to find the work that has been selected
[1:21:51] and they send theart heart and you've
[1:21:53] got to do that at home amen now to be a
[1:21:57] concert
[1:21:58] pianist you got to
[1:22:01] practice even with your husband is doing
[1:22:04] turkey calling in the other
[1:22:13] room and so she has to live that
[1:22:16] actually happened here
[1:22:19] folks cuz he wanted to make sure he
[1:22:22] sound like a
[1:22:26] turkey and so she literally throws
[1:22:28] herself into the music and listen that
[1:22:30] don't happen in five minutes there's no
[1:22:33] quick fixes stay with me on there's no
[1:22:38] quick fixes here you just don't walk
[1:22:39] into church and sit down and all of a

[1:22:50] to get yourself out of the way and cast
[1:22:52] has to figure out sitting at that
[1:22:59] piano I dare not touch
[1:23:01] it but she has to figure
[1:23:04] out I've got to make this music
[1:23:09] live I got to make it live I got to make
[1:23:12] it sound like it's supposed to sound
[1:23:15] when he wrote it down whether it's
[1:23:17] bethoven or Bach or any of the others
[1:23:19] when they wrote it they had a certain
[1:23:22] thought in their mind that it would
[1:23:24] sound this certain
[1:23:26] way she has no right to rewrite
[1:23:34] it well this note would sound better
[1:23:37] maybe Bob
[1:23:40] turn maybe
[1:23:46] Trinity she doesn't have a right to to
[1:23:49] write anything there of her own self
[1:23:53] that's
[1:23:55] right and she's got to make sure that
[1:23:57] when she plays that people are not here
[1:24:00] in
[1:24:05] Cassie they're not here in Cassie but
[1:24:08] they're
[1:24:10] hearing bethoven

[1:24:15] right
[1:24:17] Lord is this
[1:24:21] okay I I didn't disappoint you I didn't
[1:24:25] I didn't play now symphony is more than
[1:24:28] just one
[1:24:29] person now all the one the one
[1:24:33] person fulfillments has already happened
[1:24:36] in Wigan
[1:24:38] brandham there's no more prophets coming
[1:24:41] and there's no more Great Men coming
[1:24:46] and we're not looking for the next
[1:24:50] Mister we're not building kingdoms here
[1:24:53] we're expanding so your children can sit
[1:24:55] here when they get
[1:24:57] 21 look around these little guys are
[1:25:00] going to be married and they're going to
[1:25:01] be having babies and it'll happen
[1:25:05] Quicken so I can't just look at you now
[1:25:07] I got to look at you whether I'm here or
[1:25:11] whether I'm not here I got a
[1:25:15] plan so when I when I got a dining room
[1:25:18] table I brother Connie told me she said
[1:25:20] that's too big
[1:25:26] that's too big it's got 18
[1:25:29] chairs yeah yeah I I I need we're going
[1:25:32] to need a big
[1:25:33] table well she was thinking about
[1:25:35] Matthew Andrew and
[1:25:38] Whitney and then there come a stinking
[1:25:44] guy and then there came
[1:25:47] girls
[1:25:49] amen and then there came babies amen and
[1:25:53] now the table's
[1:25:55] full and now we set out other tables and
[1:25:58] set out
[1:25:59] chairs that's what we're doing
[1:26:04] here we're going to need a bigger table
[1:26:16] here once again you can correct me it's
[1:26:18] me and Cassie having a sermon this week
[1:26:21] she didn't didn't know it and here we
[1:26:23] are now a a symphony is made up of four
[1:26:27] different sections or four different
[1:26:30] movements now each movement has its own
[1:26:35] structure and its own
[1:26:39] format the first you may have to help me
[1:26:41] say some of these names the first uses a
[1:26:44] quick Tempo it's setting the pace and
[1:26:48] I'm not going to even attempt to say the
[1:26:50] word that goes behind it but it's it
[1:26:53] uses a
[1:26:55] Sonata and an a l l EEG r
[1:26:59] o Allegro I should have known that I
[1:27:02] took
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:11] Allegra has nothing to do with a leg
[1:27:18] R you've been here for a month or two
[1:27:21] we're really glad to have you but you've
[1:27:22] already figured out by now I don't have
[1:27:24] a PhD degree
[1:27:27] here now the second movement is slower
[1:27:31] and more
[1:27:32] lyrical because it's a more of a feeling
[1:27:35] type of music and I'm not going to call
[1:27:37] out because I got a great big list here
[1:27:39] I'm not going to call out all of the the
[1:27:41] pieces of music that is filling the
[1:27:43] second movement or even the third M
[1:27:46] movement is a
[1:27:49] menuette or SC
[1:27:53] h e r zo
[1:27:55] o sh sharo Scaro Scaro don't that sound
[1:28:06] Scaro and the final movement often uses
[1:28:09] a
[1:28:10] Sonata or an Allegro it went well that
[1:28:13] time didn't
[1:28:16] it now all of these make up a
[1:28:19] symphony now in each every one of them
[1:28:22] there are
[1:28:24] leaders and there's I'll just use one
[1:28:27] there's there's what they call the first
[1:28:30] chair and the first chair is the lead
[1:28:33] musician maybe to a certain set of horns
[1:28:37] all of them are playing the same type of
[1:28:39] horns but the first chair he's there
[1:28:44] because he is the
[1:28:47] best and he can make that music come
[1:28:49] alive now then there what I've read and
[1:28:53] I've done my best but there can be as
[1:28:55] many as 10 that are actually right in
[1:28:58] with him playing the same piece of music
[1:29:00] and the same
[1:29:02] instrument but none of them have the
[1:29:06] right to take the other one's place
[1:29:09] that's
[1:29:11] right none of them have the right to go
[1:29:15] off on their
[1:29:17] own none of them have the right to
[1:29:20] interpret the music in the own way one
[1:29:23] might come from France and another come
[1:29:25] from Nigeria but they're playing the
[1:29:28] same
[1:29:30] music they're playing the same music
[1:29:33] whether it's Bach Beethoven or the
[1:29:35] message of the
[1:29:46] hour everyone has a
[1:29:50] responsibility to sub subdue themselves
[1:29:52] I've got it written right here to subdue
[1:29:54] themselves and become a
[1:29:57] prisoner to the
[1:29:59] position whether ate a hamburger or a
[1:30:02] hot dog or a egg salad sandwich that
[1:30:05] morning it doesn't have anything to do
[1:30:08] once they sat
[1:30:10] down there is a dress
[1:30:14] code there is a dress code and it says
[1:30:18] it right here for for 99 % it's called
[1:30:23] tuxedo for a
[1:30:25] man and formal ladies wear and it says
[1:30:29] that dresses for the
[1:30:31] women that's not a yard sale
[1:30:34] dress and that's not a yard sale
[1:30:40] tuxedo I begin to go and take a look at
[1:30:43] just how much some of these individuals
[1:30:45] had to spend oh yeah just to dress a
[1:30:49] certain part and listen their part in
[1:30:52] the entire Symphony may not cover
[1:30:56] that or it may be that
[1:31:01] big but you're still

[1:31:20] Christ and if wants me to dress a
[1:31:23] certain way I want to dress a certain
[1:31:36] way and then it has to do not just with
[1:31:39] dresswear but it has to do with
[1:31:44] Attitude can

[1:36:57] you know this one must have been
[1:36:59] important leave your arrogance at the
[1:37:04] door this is not the place to tell your
[1:37:07] life
[1:37:09] story the mission of the symphony is to
[1:37:13] bring the music piece to
[1:37:19] life Hallelujah now you can breathe deep
[1:37:22] it's going to be okay now I've laid out
[1:37:24] the
[1:37:26] foundation brother man said when Jesus
[1:37:29] when he was on
[1:37:31] Earth they couldn't understand his
[1:37:34] ministry it was too great it was a
[1:37:39] phenomena they just couldn't a phenomena
[1:37:43] he said they couldn't understand him but
[1:37:46] he said search the
[1:37:50] scriptures
[1:37:51] search the scriptures for in them you
[1:37:54] think you have eternal life and they are
[1:37:57] they the Sheep mucus is telling
[1:38:01] you I'm
[1:38:03] he the scripture is telling you I'm
[1:38:07] fulfilling the
[1:38:09] part let me just go out on a limb the
[1:38:12] scriptures is telling you that I am the
[1:38:15] Bride of Jesus Christ this is our time
[1:38:18] this is our
[1:38:20] life right God allotted the word and he
[1:38:23] said that day was to be the
[1:38:25] manifestation of God God Emmanuel with
[1:38:28] us his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:38:31] and counselor the Prince of Peace the
[1:38:34] Mighty God the Everlasting father and
[1:38:38] his name Shall be Called
[1:38:40] Emmanuel God With
[1:38:43] Us and God was in David and God was in
[1:38:47] Moses and and that's God all the way
[1:38:50] through
[1:38:51] manifested himself for the age but this
[1:38:55] age a virgin shall
[1:38:58] conceive and shall bring forth a son and
[1:39:02] he will be God With
[1:39:07] Us are you with me how many scriptures
[1:39:11] do we have
[1:39:14] Mary being tormented by all of her
[1:39:17] enemies all of her critics
[1:39:22] I'd say less than
[1:39:24] one Jesus being
[1:39:27] homeless just only a handful of
[1:39:30] scriptures yet he owned it
[1:39:37] all Isaiah 53 and we all need the
[1:39:40] scripture who hath believed our report
[1:39:44] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:39:46] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[1:39:49] as a tender plet as a root out of dry
[1:39:51] ground and he hath no form or cess and
[1:39:53] when we shall see him there is no beauty
[1:39:55] that we should desire him he is
[1:40:00] despised and rejected of men a Man of
[1:40:03] Sorrows and acquainted with grief and we
[1:40:07] hid as if it were our faces from him he
[1:40:10] was despised and we esteemed him
[1:40:13] not surely he hath borne our
[1:40:19] griefs carried our
[1:40:24] sorrows listen all of those things were
[1:40:27] going to be a part of our
[1:40:29] music they're going to be a part of our
[1:40:32] lives but they are not the important
[1:40:37] part all of us are going to have trouble
[1:40:39] so does the world all of us are going to
[1:40:42] have Sorrows so does the world all of us
[1:40:44] are going to be grief stricken so does
[1:40:47] the world but the difference is he's in
[1:40:50] our boat
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:57] I don't know how people face whatever
[1:40:59] they face without
[1:41:01] God I I I I I just have to be honest
[1:41:04] with you what some people face I don't
[1:41:07] understand how they get through it
[1:41:08] without
[1:41:10] God are you with me you can get down on
[1:41:13] your knees and pray not through a
[1:41:15] preacher but you can
[1:41:18] pray you can pray and and sometimes your
[1:41:22] your prayers don't feel like they hit
[1:41:23] the ceiling sometimes it feels like the
[1:41:26] clouds are wide open and you're talking
[1:41:28] to God himself and you get a warm tingly
[1:41:31] s sensation and you know everything's
[1:41:33] going to be okay God hears
[1:41:38] amen God
[1:41:40] hears every time you
[1:41:45] [Applause]
[1:41:46] pray there will be times that you walk
[1:41:49] in here and you walk out feeling like
[1:41:50] you're
[1:41:51] Rapture and there'll be times you walk
[1:41:54] in you walk
[1:41:58] out well I just must not have got what I
[1:42:00] needed to what made the difference it
[1:42:04] wasn't a
[1:42:05] preacher it was
[1:42:08] you and you can always look back and go
[1:42:11] was I
[1:42:17] prepared are you with me just hold that
[1:42:20] just for few
[1:42:38] moments I was a chimne chimney sweep I
[1:42:41] actually started in
[1:42:46] 1989 and I started like everybody else I
[1:42:49] just kind of started out
[1:42:51] just working trying to pray the phone
[1:42:55] ring and I went to a very large old
[1:42:58] house it was couple hundred years
[1:43:00] old and I met a man
[1:43:03] there he was a skinny sort of fell he
[1:43:06] was tall
[1:43:08] skinny had really dark eyes and really
[1:43:11] dark
[1:43:12] hair and if I can just say it
[1:43:16] properly he was a hippie
[1:43:19] type and so he he told me he Saidi want
[1:43:22] you to tell me exactly how these
[1:43:24] chimneys need to be restored in the
[1:43:26] right way he said ' now you may not be
[1:43:29] able to do it and I'm really not
[1:43:31] expecting you to do it but I'd like for
[1:43:34] you to clean my chimney and tell me
[1:43:36] exactly how to make them right back to
[1:43:38] where they were when they were
[1:43:41] built and so I gave him some
[1:43:43] instructions and he said now you know I
[1:43:46] know you don't want to touch the brick
[1:43:48] work or the mortar work and you you
[1:43:50] don't want to do that you don't have the
[1:43:51] time to do that and I understand he said
[1:43:53] but I need Lids to put on top of these
[1:43:57] chimneys you remember his name was Barry
[1:44:01] hop and so I uh nothing wrong with my
[1:44:05] memory today and so so anyway I I gave
[1:44:09] him I gave him a an estimate of
[1:44:12] cost and
[1:44:14] so brother Thomas you know sometimes you
[1:44:16] meet that customer and you go they can't
[1:44:18] afford this and and so I be to talk to
[1:44:22] Barry and I said now this is going to
[1:44:24] cost pretty good money here I said and
[1:44:26] that day it was a
[1:44:29] couple, and so I said we're just going
[1:44:31] to put Lids on it and we're going to
[1:44:33] we're going to put a vent cap that will
[1:44:35] go up and down and so when you need a
[1:44:38] vent you can open it up or you can you
[1:44:40] can close it down and you don't want it
[1:44:41] seen by the interstate going by you and
[1:44:45] I said Barry C can you afford
[1:44:49] this he said well I think
[1:44:51] so and I said I said Barry I I hate to
[1:44:55] be I hate to be uh inquisitive in your
[1:44:59] Affairs but you know when I get the work
[1:45:01] done I I need to know that you can
[1:45:02] afford
[1:45:04] this I said what do you do he said well
[1:45:08] I'm a I'm a
[1:45:09] restorer that's my job I'm a
[1:45:12] restorer I'm going somewhere this goes
[1:45:14] with the sermon and he said I'm a
[1:45:17] restorer he said now in restoration
[1:45:21] you got to bring it back to the way it
[1:45:23] was
[1:45:24] originally and you got to you got to the
[1:45:26] guy that built it you got to find out
[1:45:28] what his intricate details that he likes
[1:45:31] and so you got to go back and do it
[1:45:32] exactly like he did it he said let me
[1:45:35] show you a piece of artwork that I'm
[1:45:37] working on and I walk in and there's a
[1:45:39] piece of artwork and it's a it's a
[1:45:41] family sitting around a table and
[1:45:43] there's
[1:45:45] there's there's fruit on the
[1:45:47] table and it's it's really nice nice and
[1:45:50] it's got certain jugs on the table and
[1:45:53] certain things and and it's had some
[1:45:54] water damage and he said I have been
[1:45:57] assigned to restore this piece of art to
[1:46:00] where that it's like its original
[1:46:03] texture and he he began to explain
[1:46:05] something to you and this will fit in
[1:46:06] the sermon so he said I got to figure
[1:46:09] out exactly and analyze this
[1:46:12] canvas exactly what it's made of and
[1:46:15] then I've got to find out exactly the
[1:46:18] the the ink that was used and the paint
[1:46:21] that was used and I got to find the
[1:46:23] brush and not just the brush but the
[1:46:25] hairs have got to be exactly like that
[1:46:28] and even the stem's got to be right
[1:46:30] because I got to study the artist and
[1:46:32] his stroke and I got to stroke it
[1:46:35] exactly like he stroked
[1:46:40] it and I and he said now now here's the
[1:46:44] the detail of it if I don't get the
[1:46:47] right texture or if I don't get the
[1:46:49] right pain or if I I don't get the right
[1:46:51] stroke and if I don't do it a certain
[1:46:53] way and let it age a certain way I Mar
[1:46:56] the
[1:47:01] Masterpiece now he said for this piece
[1:47:03] of work I I'll get a million
[1:47:07] dollars and I felt about that
[1:47:13] tall asking him for $2,000 for a piece
[1:47:17] of metal on the top of his
[1:47:19] roof
[1:47:21] amen he said Ron I'd like for you to
[1:47:24] come and see this house when it's
[1:47:26] restored so you can see my
[1:47:31] work two years later they called us and
[1:47:34] so I went back and there was there was
[1:47:37] listen and I'm going to say it lightly
[1:47:40] there was probably 50 people there for
[1:47:42] open house and I had an invitation you
[1:47:45] had to have an invitation to go I showed
[1:47:47] up in my red because it was Christmas
[1:47:50] time I showed up in my red Santa Claus
[1:47:52] chimney cleaning
[1:48:03] outfit and when I get
[1:48:06] there I park where I'm supposed to
[1:48:09] park and I'm greeted by the University
[1:48:12] of North Carolina and Duke University is
[1:48:16] there UVA is there they have their
[1:48:19] representatives and in in in art and
[1:48:23] also in engineering and they're all
[1:48:27] there and I walk up a
[1:48:30] walkway that was not there before but it
[1:48:34] is an
[1:48:35] elegant detail and I walk up to a brand
[1:48:39] new porch and I walk up I walk up to the
[1:48:42] door and I walk in and sign in and it
[1:48:45] don't look like the same house that I
[1:48:47] walked in two years ago
[1:48:53] the sheetrock was made out of pig
[1:48:56] hair and so he had to go get
[1:48:59] Farmers that would take care of the pigs
[1:49:02] and when they got ready to to cut the
[1:49:04] pigs they had to do it a certain way so
[1:49:06] the hair wasn't coat and then he would
[1:49:09] mix it in the mud so it would be a
[1:49:11] certain way on the walls
[1:49:14] am and you know at the end of it this
[1:49:16] really struck me and he came over and
[1:49:18] asked me said how you like it
[1:49:20] I said I I feel like I've stepped back
[1:49:22] in time he said that's exactly where you
[1:49:24] need to
[1:49:25] feel you're standing 200 years ago and
[1:49:30] friends have came over for the first
[1:49:32] time and you're seeing the
[1:49:35] house that's
[1:49:37] right and he said Ron if you'll remember
[1:49:40] the conversation that we had when we
[1:49:42] first
[1:49:43] met he said you remember that piece of
[1:49:47] artwork he said I don't have the right
[1:49:49] to sign my name at the bottom of it
[1:49:53] that's
[1:49:56] right he said I have restored this house
[1:49:59] to the original
[1:50:03] Builder and he said nowhere will you
[1:50:06] find my
[1:50:11] name nowhere will you find my
[1:50:15] name attached to how I built it I had to
[1:50:20] do it exactly the way it ought to be

[2:02:54] rest are you with me so you show up at
[2:02:57] the

[2:03:01] sudden that ain't what we came for
[2:03:05] right that ain't what we came for
[2:03:08] there's a
[2:03:11] guy where you hide them
[2:03:15] sticks I can play this
[2:03:19] well I can't see but I can play
[2:03:24] this I picked two of the same it's
[2:03:27] pretty incredible and there's a guy
[2:03:29] comes out and there's there's generally
[2:03:31] about an hour prep right before people
[2:03:34] come out they warm themselves up call it
[2:03:37] what do you call it warming the
[2:03:40] lips and they start ready to ready to
[2:03:43] play and they're getting ready and you
[2:03:45] know it sounds like a bunch of nonsense
[2:03:47] it
[2:03:50] you
[2:03:51] know you know all of these people are
[2:03:53] warming up and warming up and you think
[2:03:56] what in the world is going to go on
[2:03:59] here and I paid this money to sit here
[2:04:01] and they're they're all they come into
[2:04:03] their places and some comes a little
[2:04:05] different times than others they all
[2:04:07] come to their place the leader will
[2:04:09] begin to make sure that all of his
[2:04:11] groups in
[2:04:14] line the guy with a triangle the guy the
[2:04:17] guy in the back with the drums most
[2:04:19] generally there's several sets of drums
[2:04:21] all of them have certain characteristics
[2:04:23] that they play with there's a guy comes
[2:04:25] out in the tuxedo most of the time they
[2:04:27] got bushy hair I don't know what that
[2:04:28] deal is
[2:04:30] but as a guy comes out I let mine grow I
[2:04:34] had be
[2:04:35] bushy he comes out and he gets a
[2:04:38] stick and that stick absolutely means
[2:04:42] something if you're part of the players
[2:04:45] it absolutely means
[2:04:47] something and every time he moves it in
[2:04:49] a certain way it's designed to do
[2:04:53] certain things to bring certain emphasis
[2:04:57] on certain
[2:05:02] music and then he begins to bring it
[2:05:05] forth he will turn introduce himself to
[2:05:07] the
[2:05:09] audience it's not about
[2:05:12] him he has selected now 300 people from
[2:05:17] all over the world
[2:05:19] they are the best of the
[2:05:22] best this is not the day that you
[2:05:26] practice I'm winding up now this is not
[2:05:29] the day that you
[2:05:31] practice this is the day that you're at
[2:05:33] your
[2:05:35] best the background story don't matter
[2:05:38] whatsoever the weather outside don't
[2:05:40] matter whatsoever
[2:05:45] today this song is about when the rooll
[2:05:48] is Called Up Yonder I'll be
[2:05:54] there and he begins to wave his sticks
[2:05:58] and he'll take you from deity of Jesus
[2:06:00] Christ all the way through
[2:06:04] communion and no matter how long you've
[2:06:06] been in the symphony it's as fresh to
[2:06:09] you as the first time you heard
[2:06:13] it and why does that director get so
[2:06:16] excited amen why does he get so excited
[2:06:21] because he has been inspired by the
[2:06:24] music he knows how it needs to
[2:06:29] sound he knows I have gathered the best
[2:06:33] of the best of the
[2:06:35] best and now they have come at Peak
[2:06:39] efficiency and it's not about one it's
[2:06:42] about
[2:06:44] 300 we're going to bring this to life
[2:07:02] if I could name a few names now William
[2:07:05] brandham is standing just beyond the
[2:07:09] realm and this message was not just to
[2:07:11] be in tape and book form it's to be in
[2:07:15] human
[2:07:16] vessels to overcome Le
[2:07:19] oia not to be diminished or to be
[2:07:23] deluded or to be watered down it's Jesus
[2:07:27] Christ in every one of us 6y old 14
[2:07:32] years old 21 years old 90 years
[2:07:36] old I got good news for you we're going
[2:07:39] to
[2:07:40] [Music]
[2:07:47] overcome
[2:07:57] we're not waiting on a man to direct
[2:07:59] it the Holy Ghost is here that's
[2:08:02] right that's
[2:08:04] right the Holy Ghost is
[2:08:08] here so brother Randall when we come to
[2:08:12] a difficult spot in
[2:08:14] music it isn't the music that's wrong
[2:08:18] it's
[2:08:20] we so we
[2:08:24] pray that our attitude will
[2:08:27] change because the music's not going to
[2:08:29] change that's
[2:08:33] right and remember this how important
[2:08:35] you
[2:08:36] are it wasn't you chose
[2:08:44] God it wasn't you chose
[2:08:47] God
[2:08:49] God chose
[2:09:01] you I want that settle
[2:09:07] in I'm going to take one more minute if
[2:09:10] I
[2:09:11] can when I was a little bitty boy was
[2:09:14] four years old when we walked by a
[2:09:17] casket in Jeffersonville
[2:09:25] Indiana my daddy told me that William
[2:09:28] brandham is a
[2:09:30] prophet we went to the Jeffersonville
[2:09:33] meetings every Easter to listen to a
[2:09:36] tape until
[2:09:40] 1977 there was a certain year that we
[2:09:43] went and we didn't have a place to set
[2:09:46] in the building
[2:09:49] and I was about 11 years old and Doc
[2:09:54] brandom he loved dad and he said would
[2:09:57] you would you would you feel would you
[2:10:00] feel okay if we sit in the in the
[2:10:04] baptistry big white
[2:10:08] baptistry and dad took me
[2:10:11] around Mark stayed with
[2:10:15] Mom and so dad walked me around and we
[2:10:18] went down the steps and sit in the
[2:10:21] Baptist
[2:10:22] tree now here's how things work I was
[2:10:25] sitting in the baptistry and there's a
[2:10:28] curtain right in front of me and we
[2:10:29] heard the prophet speak by
[2:10:33] tape and sitting directly where that
[2:10:37] curtain come together was an 18-year-old
[2:10:40] boy that I would later meet as an older
[2:10:43] man and his name was Tim
[2:10:47] prit
[2:10:49] and all the other meetings that he had
[2:10:51] went to preacher set on the platform so
[2:10:54] when he walks in he thinks it's his
[2:10:56] thing to do is to go up and set on the
[2:10:59] platform so he goes and sits on the

[2:12:36] place when I walked in brother Josh's
[2:12:38] office last year when I was helping
[2:12:40] preach his meeting brother Josh has a
[2:12:43] man in his church that
[2:12:45] bills he bills uh a a certain style
[2:12:49] furniture he puts a deer head in it
[2:12:52] piece of metal he puts all different
[2:12:54] kind of things in
[2:12:55] it and I was just odd I I couldn't
[2:12:58] hardly look at the brothers by looking
[2:13:00] at this piece of art and this man had
[2:13:02] quit his job to take care of his wife
[2:13:05] who's now an
[2:13:07] invilet and to make extra money not in
[2:13:10] some great big building but in his
[2:13:14] yard he creates Masterpiece work
[2:13:19] I want you to go get that knife the
[2:13:22] knife that's sitting on it's actually
[2:13:24] it's in a box now I boxed it
[2:13:27] up and I just said boy that's beautiful
[2:13:31] that's an incredible
[2:13:32] thing Jos said would you like for him to
[2:13:35] build you one I said oh I couldn't ask
[2:13:38] for something like that that's
[2:13:41] Masterpiece he went down he had alterior
[2:13:44] motiv but he went
[2:13:46] down and he called me the other day
[2:13:49] wanted to called Andrew said can I come
[2:13:52] by your house I got something for
[2:13:53] brother Ron I no idea what he what he
[2:13:56] was bringing I didn't even know where
[2:13:58] you went shame on you supposed to tell
[2:14:01] me and so anyway he he says brother Ron
[2:14:06] and I go out to greet him I thought
[2:14:08] maybe he's going to give me some
[2:14:10] coffee and I go out to greet him and and
[2:14:14] he he begins to pull this piece out
[2:14:18] and it's a maybe I'll bring a picture in
[2:14:19] a couple weeks it's a picture of
[2:14:23] a it's it's a it's an artwork of a deer
[2:14:26] 10-point deer and on the top of that
[2:14:29] 10-point deer is a
[2:14:32] mouse and it's all made out of metal and
[2:14:35] I mean these animals look
[2:14:37] alive the deer's carcass but but all of
[2:14:41] them look alive and there's a snake at
[2:14:43] the bottom rattlesnake
[2:14:45] slithering and there's a tree that's
[2:14:48] there and on the top of the tree it's
[2:14:49] one of the most PE beautiful pieces of
[2:14:51] wood that were put together it was trash
[2:14:59] wood trash wood that he took and made
[2:15:03] new
[2:15:05] again you have thought it was a piece of
[2:15:07] art and then there's this snake on the
[2:15:10] on on the bottom and this deer head laid
[2:15:13] over like this and on the top of the
[2:15:14] deer head there's a
[2:15:15] mouse and then there's a tree of life
[2:15:19] that is holding this piece of wood up I
[2:15:23] said well there's got to be a story to
[2:15:25] this now here's a man taking care of his
[2:15:29] wife that must be taken care of he's
[2:15:32] quit his job a good paying job to be
[2:15:34] able to take care of his wife and in the
[2:15:36] time that he can he builds these
[2:15:38] masterpieces works of art and I'm that
[2:15:40] Mouse on that on
[2:15:43] that on that deer head at antler I'm
[2:15:47] that mou house on that antler and that
[2:15:51] snake can't get to me because I'm too
[2:15:54] close to the Tree of
[2:16:00] Life what that man
[2:16:04] did the music of his
[2:16:08] life sets in my living
[2:16:11] room as a
[2:16:14] masterpiece and you know what the key of
[2:16:16] it is I don't even know what the man
[2:16:18] looks
[2:16:20] like I've never shook his
[2:16:23] hand but I've seen his
[2:16:29] [Applause]
[2:16:43] work last
[2:16:45] night this was brought to to me in the
[2:16:48] back room you mind if I just tell a
[2:16:50] couple more stories your roast won't
[2:16:53] burn too
[2:16:55] bad brother
[2:16:57] Jonathan that likes
[2:17:01] Charity
[2:17:03] Siler sister Connie helps me
[2:17:07] talk he wanted to do something special
[2:17:10] for
[2:17:10] me so he got a knife made by a company
[2:17:15] called black
[2:17:16] mumba and it's supposed to be a very
[2:17:19] special
[2:17:21] metal and they made this knife
[2:17:23] especially for
[2:17:24] me amen Jonathan didn't bring it but he
[2:17:29] sent
[2:17:30] it has a really nice display case that
[2:17:34] goes with
[2:17:35] it Jonathan was here in a prayer line
[2:17:39] last year and God touched his life so he
[2:17:43] wanted to do something
[2:17:46] special and Gabriel thought it was a
[2:17:49] special
[2:17:50] knife so being a special knife it wasn't
[2:17:53] going to be used on deer and bear and
[2:17:55] turkey I hadn't have much luck with
[2:17:59] turkey so he put the
[2:18:02] cloud on the
[2:18:04] knife and that makes it even more
[2:18:08] special reason I'm telling you that is
[2:18:10] Jonathan didn't come and delivered
[2:18:14] himself he sent it like God sent his
[2:18:19] word and whether you see him or whether
[2:18:23] you feel
[2:18:27] him it's a
[2:18:33] masterpiece and when God showed us a
[2:18:35] vision of coming here to be the
[2:18:40] pastor he didn't show me you as a
[2:18:44] crowd he just and I I didn't know these
[2:18:47] these boys would be working with me but
[2:18:49] all I knew was it was God's purpose and
[2:18:54] plan and if I'm to be in this part of
[2:18:57] the symphony I want to do the best job
[2:19:00] that I know how to
[2:19:05] do I've told you about a chair and I I
[2:19:08] told you about the Masterpiece of that
[2:19:10] work and I've showed you
[2:19:14] this boy I bet that means a lot to you
