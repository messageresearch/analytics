there in Louisiana amen so we just thank the Lord for that and how the Lord is moving in a mighty way even there you know it's not just Happening Here in Elkton Virginia it's happening around the world so we thank the Lord for that that he's calling a bride and he'll know the time of the hour and the exact exact season that we will be Slipped Away From Here amen amen are you happy to be here this morning just a reminder there will be no service next Sunday morning because we will have our fall Fellowship that is at Grand Caverns we will begin to gather about 12 30 and start everything off about one o'clock so just tell your neighbor look over and say we will not have service next Sunday morning but we will be gathering at Grand Caverns for a fall Fellowship amen we enjoy that time don't we I just love this time of year you know this morning when I walked outside that coldness I don't know about anybody else but I love it when it's cool crisp the leaves are starting to turn it's

Holy House of Prayer and so we want to enter his gates with praises and Thanksgiving we want to come in reverently holy reading our Bible just worshiping him we want to create an atmosphere amen so

tune every instrument make sure everything was perfect and you better not be talking while he's tuning you better be prepared for the service amen so we want to be remembering that and just just come in reverently and holy that you know that the Lord would just move upon your heart because maybe it may be in service for you and maybe it's service for somebody else and you don't want to hinder somebody forgetting their blessing amen so just be remembering those things man let's just sing a song you made a way for me away aren't you glad he made a way when they're seen no other way and you

it Lord God I ask you the truthless move upon the hearts of the people this Lord I ask you that you'll just let me step aside this morning Lord give us what we need want what we need this morning as we read these scriptures we ask you to just let them just jump off the page and move Upon Our Hearts this morning [Music] amen it's good to be here what a wonderful atmosphere that is here this morning amen I'd like to turn this morning to Psalms 51 and verse 5 if you would turn there with me in the scriptures this morning amen Psalms 51 and verse 5. and it says it like this said behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me behold thou desirest truth in my inward parts and in the hideth part Thou shalt make me known to wisdom Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow make me to hear the joy of gladness that the bones which thou has broken May Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities created me a clean heart o God and renew a right Spirit Within Me cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit amen you can have your seats this morning this morning I would like to speak on born in a mess raised in a mess coming out of a mess amen I like how David would say it here and brother Branham would say it like this and we all know it and in this way it says for I was born in sin I was shapened in iniquity and I come into the world speaking lies we were Sinners by Nature then God has redeemed us and redeemed our soul and has blessed us blessed the body waiting for us that can never be sick even above Temptation a body like his own glorious body then shall we see him as he is amen aren't you glad at that this morning that we shall see him as he truly is you might think that this is odd text born in a mess raised in a mess coming out of a mess and you might say brother Matthew well you're the son of a pastor the grandson of a Preacher but yet I needed Jesus amen you know I I hung up my angel wings in the back that's what Cassie thinks at least no not really I needed Jesus just like each and every one of us for we were born in sin as he would say I come into this world speaking lies you say well I've never spoke a lot in my life well when you cried out in the middle of the night as a child and your mother come running well there was you didn't need a diaper change she had just fed you you didn't need a burp and she would lay you back down and she'd go and and then you'd cry again well a little bit of lying going on there was a little bit of an attention there you understand what I'm saying your mothers know and so so we was all with sin we come into this world in a sinly fashion you know there was a there was a purpose and a place of how we would have been in the Garden of Eden we would have just been spoken into existence but after that was broken we had to come in through another way but God seen us even then and so this morning I would like to take and if you want to go back for a background you can listen to birth pains and then adoption so I'll be drawing from those this morning and brother branham's messages so just uh if you would like to listen to those I think that would be good that's where I'm drawing from this morning and we got brother William back here with sister Gabrielle at home and she's going through some birth painting right now there's something on the inside of her that's working that says I'm about to come out of here and I was probably the number one praying for him this week at the beginning of the week I was saying Lord just let him come and by yesterday about six o'clock I said Lord just let him stay amen sorry about that sister Gabriella so I was praying in two different ways there for your birth pains amen so she's starting to feel the effect and there's something on the inside there and that baby is starting to feel that pressure and and it's starting to say that's a little uncomfortable in here it's beginning to to press and there's things getting tighter there's some squeezing going on in there but that's the way that this world is even right now it's groaning there's things moving when we're sitting here and we're going hey this just don't feel right there's something that's calling me to get out of here as dad would speak that Sermon Just the other week that said you cannot stay here we cannot stay in that warm just Comfort condition as the children of Israel they would be fed with Manna day in and day out but they was going through some birth pains at that time there was some Heavenly manner that was given to them but once they reached that Promised Land oh there they had come out of that stage of that just wonderful nourishment but there was some corn that had to be fed to him there was some real manner that had to come forth and so with this child as he's about to come forth he's going to go through a stage amen and I was a little concerned that brother William might even be speaking what I was speaking on just because what they was going through but hey the Lord laid this on my heart amen and so we want to look at brother Branham tells a story about the farmer how he went up to the mountains and grabbed an eagle egg and he took that eagle egg and he took it to was born and he had laying hens there in his barn and and he laid that eagles egg underneath of a hen well it was the right kind of place for it but it wasn't the real mother but that eagle came forth and and that chicken that would be in the barnyard and and it would cluck around and it would eat worms and and that eagle would look over at and like what in the world are y'all doing and they would just cluck and they would find a worm and they would be all so happy also happy we found just this Worm but that eagle he had something on the inside of him they said this this is not satisfying this is not to me this is not what I'm Desiring in in me and the other chickens they thought well you're just an odd duck you're just an odd Eagle you know but he knew something that was laying there on the inside of him he didn't know exactly you didn't know exactly what was laying on the inside of you but you knew there was something that was laying there that you desired in your heart that said this just isn't for me this just isn't what I want amen and so one day that that mother Eagle that had been searching searching all over the Lord that had been searching all over for you that cry went out over top of that eagle and she said oh that's my son down there see he was born in a mess oh what a mess it was and that old a farm yard down in there just mud and worms and it's just a mess but he heard a cry and he said that that is what I've been looking for I wasn't meant to stay here I was meant to fly there and all he stretched out those wings and he flew forth and he knew that from that moment on that's not where I meant to be and there was no going back once he received that message that voice that said son come out of her amen aren't you glad that you heard that one day that you said I'm not a chicken in this old Barnyard anymore I've received a word from the Lord and that cry that said come out of her amen aren't you glad of that this morning oh gods are so good to us that we can hear his cry amen that seed that was laying down on the inside of us amen we're about to go through a wintering time we're in Fall now the Harvest times the reaping of it but we're about to go through a wintering time to where that there are seeds that's going to be laying on the inside there's going to be acorns that has been dropping all over the fourth floor well there's going to be leaves that will cover them and those acorns in the right atmosphere at the right place they will begin to come forth and you might not see it down beneath there and just like that Pond Lily that seed that's down in that pond that that seed is down there but at the right atmosphere and the right Sun even in whatever mess that it is it will start to grow it'll start to come forth it'll start to bloom down underneath there amen all of us all of us we were born in this sin but we were shaping an iniquity amen so we begin to just say hey this is something here I there's something brooding on the inside of me there's something that's starting to Bud forth and coming out and many times even fires will come across the forest floor but that is a type of way that the Lord will just burn out that oldness that will burn out those things and their seeds and beautiful flowers that would come forth and trees and things that would come forth and Bud and give us life for we don't want to stay in this whole world amen we wanted to we want to be forth and be blooming in his holiness brother Brandon would say it like this in first John and 5 and 7 said I believe it is he said if I'm not mistaken is there there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one there there are three that bear record in the earth and that's the water the blood and the spirit and they agree in one now notice the first three are one and the second three are Earthly it's a type whatever is in the earth much type the spiritual amen but you have to have the water without the blood you can't have the water without the blood and the blood without the spirit I Think Through the Ages has proven this to be true the water the blood and the spirit justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where many get held up they want to go through justification as brother William was saying last night if we was just in Wesley's day in that just time and but you don't just stay in justification you move on to sanctification and many people would go on to sanctification but they would not want the moving of the Holy Ghost they would not want the baptism of the Holy Spirit upon their lives because they were scared of what it would do for them as brother Brandon would say you would scare the move upon the heart of the people and they'd want to give out a shout but no I don't want to do that amen but that's what is calling for if you can't just have one without the other if you end with one you have a stillbirth but that's the what the church world is wanting to produce is stillborn children amen they they don't want this just crying and weeping out and willing and a moving of the sins they want the blood without the sacrifice amen as brother Brad as brother William was speaking last night about bringing forth those sacrifices he paid that price for us he shed that blood for us the accepted blood that we can just take our sins and blot out but those people they those churches they do not want that and many people will come up and have a dry confession say oh well I've got it no you don't really have it until you've been born out until you've been birthed out until that fire has come across you you can go into justification you can stay in sanctification but you can't just stay there you have to move on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost I enjoyed last weekend we had 35 members that was baptized here and uh one of the last times that we had a moving of the Holy Ghost like that where many was baptized I was involved in that brother Jason Smith was involved in there and I think it was 15 brother Jeffrey actually started it that night and he was one of the first ones to be baptized and and you see that and that was a move at that time upon the hearts of the people here and that's what you can build a church upon right there and we just had 35 last weekend and all you just think oh what can we build upon a church now amen we didn't just stay here and just be like well that was good enough we thank the Lord for that no we continued to move on Amen we continue to seek the Lord and we will seek the Lord until he come for us amen amen as dad was speaking to that sermon that you can't stay here amen the world is groaning even even Biden announced that Armageddon is upon the Verge well even the president can see that the people in this world can see that that there is a groaning that's coming forth it's about to be birthed amen aren't you glad of that that this whole world is about to be birthed hey but we can't stay here you can't stay in this mess you've got to get into the word of the Lord you've got to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remissions of your sins just like many of us have already done amen and a natural birth is a mess it is a mess you know granddaddy would say there's a lot of you that come into the world as a mess but I came in in a three-piece suit amen brother brother you remember him saying that all the time he he'd say you know there's many people that come in but I come in in a three-piece suit well he enjoyed saying that but that's not the truth amen he had to be born just the same way each and every one of us had to be and it was a mess there's the water that would break the blood that come forth but there's something on the inside that when the baby is born you don't want to just see it you want to hear that baby amen when that baby would cry out after it's being birthed sent through that chamber you want to hear that cry and and they would stake and spank that baby and maybe it's just saying they were spanking it and you might think well that's awful but hey hey that's bringing forth a life right there let's bring them forth for crying you want that cry you want that cry to come out it was in a mess hey but when that cry come forth oh that was music to the years amen amen we thank the Lord for that but many people in nowadays they reject the birthright I want to take you through Jacob as as he wanted to accept and Esau despised the birthright but Jacob was a mess oh he he was a he was a mess and he would be a lot like us before we met Jesus we was a mess a lot of things that we did we ain't proud of we was a mess amen but Jacob he wanted that Birthright and his brother Esau as he would come forth from the fields and he would hunger and he would say oh give me some of that porridge that that you would have and Jacob would say no you sell me that Birthright send me the birthright and so there's many people in this age that would sell out the birthright for a pot of porridge something that was fancy something that's nice they have no respect they despise the birthright but Jacob he would take and he would want that Birthright he would want that blessing oh he was deceiver and what a mess that he was in and we look and when we go man how in the world down Through the Ages and you look and there was Jacob and he was in a a mess he he continued to make messes out of messes he would deceive his father he would put goat's clothing around his arms just to deceive his father he he would have the venison that would just be like Esau would make it just so he could receive that blessing and you would think how would God bless him through a deception well see it was a longing on the inside of him that God knew said I'm going to bless him that's the one I love Jacob have a love Esau have a hated he would even say amen for he chose you and we're going to get in that a little bit later I don't want to go too much but he was in a mess but he decided I'm coming out of that mess and he met the Lord one night and he said he grabbed a hold of you he said I will not let you go until you bless me I won't let you go until you bless me let's read upon another mess and and another guy that was raised in a mess I said now that's Moses now Moses was raised up and all the Theology of Egypt could afford to give him and he was smart until he could teach the masters of Egypt some wisdom and he knew that he was born a Hebrew and he knew that he was born a deliverer but look what a mess he made out of it he tried within himself before he had an experience do you see what I'm saying he tried within what he thought was right to be the deliverer but he was making a mess out of it I mean he was raised in Egypt there what a wonderful place it would have been just to be able to learn the things that he would he was learning as the world would say but he was in a mess he created even more of a mess amen he had all the schooling he had all the knowledge that he was a deliverer but you see he had never had any experience yet but oh brother when God met him there in the burning bush he knew what he was after then he know that who he had believed and he could endure the rest of the 80 years seeing who was the invisible one see he met him in that mess he had an experience with him that brought him out of that mess within his own self he was making even a more of a mess he was a murderer in his own self because he was trying to be a deliverer without the help of God Amen and many times when we were born in a mess we're and you can take this as any age this is not just a for the children this is for every single person here in this building and that's listening by the way of the internet but you can take this and apply this for your situation right now you might have been born in a situation of life you might have been raised up and many times the devil will present a way out that you would say I'm getting out of this mess but instead you actually create even a more of a mess you you might say well I'm going to move out of this state of poverty and marry this this young man that has everything but that's not just what you want you want the guiding of the Lord to say hey this is where you need to be at and so many times you see a young lady that might be in in a mess in her and you might see a young man that say Hey that that might be the perfect match in our own Humanity but that might not be God's Will and in the mess that we're in we'll go I'm going to move into that because he can provide for me better well that's not what the Lord would want and you create even more of a mess and be you would marry someone you would might even have children by someone and you're creating even a more and more and more of a mess and then you're in the same state that you was before and and so many times we see this in our lives that the devil will present something that would look so close it's so right that you go well I'm going to do that and you don't do it without the guiding of the Lord and you just step into it but seek the Lord while he may yet be found amen Moses was led by the pillar of Fire after he had the experience seek him receive an experience don't just have a dry confession be led by the Holy Spirit be led by that Pillar of Fire amen seek Him amen have an experience because an experience will get you out of this old chaos he was a one-man Invasion after he had an experience when he came down there in the Egyptians halls and he threw forth that the stick amen they thought that hey we can do the exact same thing but at this point he was no longer in a mess he had an experience amen amen excuse me amen and we even see brother Branham he would uh he would tell us about the story of the young boy that he had seen a vision he was at his mother's home and he had seen a vision of this young boy that that was sick and laying in the bed and he seen certain things and and he come down and his mother asked him sit and said what's wrong or whatever and he said I've seen a vision and there was a knock at the door and it was I believe his name was brother uh Emil and uh I knocked at the door right and he said my child is sick would you come and so on the way he picked up brother Snelling and they would be traveling out through there and brother Branham asked him he said no no is this your house is this such and such is and he would describe it exactly how it was as your baby like this is it and he would describe each and everything and the brother said yes have you been there have you been there because he was he was a Seer and so he's seen that but he's seen that baby hope but there were some things that had to be in place at the time and so he told this brother your brother your baby's going to be made well so they get to the house and and they gather around and the fathers you know he's there and and they began and they pray but everything wasn't in the right order it wasn't in the right place and so the baby he would describe it he said that baby didn't only get better it actually got worse and they it thought it was about to die and the mother and the the father would work with it and and so it carried on through the night and and the next day as brother Branham and them were are still there and he was he was saying I've I've messed it up I I've messed this I've missed something here because something wasn't in the right place I seen it now this wasn't here but once this is here this is how it needs he said I I know I've seen it but this baby was it was about to die and he was thinking oh Lord don't let this be upon me don't don't let this because of what are the mess I have made and so as they're sitting there the this older lady would come forth and brother brantham well she's got to be in the house and he hadn't seen her there the first time so she comes into the house and and brother Snelling was about to leave for work I believe it is and he said I knew brother Snelling needed to be in the house as well and I seen that dual full chair chair I seen the glasses and the hat and he said I seen that everything had to be in a certain order he said so I was sitting in that chair I do a full chair he said and I thought she's got to be sitting in that chair he said so I I get up and I just and I'm just thinking I'm praying and I'm going it needs to be happening exactly this way but see he could not tell them you go sit here you go do this you go do that it would have made even more of a mess and and many times in our own life we're told something where we think something's supposed to be a certain way and in our mind we're going this is how it should happen Okay so I I need to do this I need to be there at this time let God have control of the situation amen don't don't just rush into a thing and you create a mess out of it even in your own self let God have control of the situation you be guided by God and so brother Brandon would step to the side there and he would just begin to pray and and they were just so saddened at this time because the baby was still sick and coughing and he looked over and he said brother Emma do you still have faith in me he said oh brother Branham I love you I love you and he just took the baby and he prayed well everything was then in its right order every place everything was exactly the way it should have been it was a perfect picture the mess was cleaned up amen the Lord had moved in a certain way to move each and every person each and every place as they should have been and that he grabbed a hold of that baby and and as he prayed for that baby oh Lord forgive me where I messed up and that's the way we should be many times that we we might have created a mess and you go oh Lord just forgive me for where I messed up forgive me for how I acted in this certain way I thought this was but it wasn't the way I should have acted this wasn't what I should have done anybody and that baby began to scream and cry out and say daddy daddy daddy amen I said at that point the vision had been completed amen excuse me not completed but it had come to the point that brother Brandon had seen it there and it was then completed on the next day when he had went down and he told the Church of what had happened and he said and when I go back that baby will come and he said I'm Healed I'm Healed aren't you glad of that that that out of a mess we can come forth and God will put us in our exact position amen I'm glad that the Lord will do that for me and work away when there seems no other way aren't you glad of that this morning amen and so at as we're raised in a mess talking about that we do certain things amen like I was saying you you think it needs to be one way but the Lord needs to guide you and so the best way is to come out of the mess by using his word aren't you glad that you can be found in his word this morning and brother Brandon would say it like this how to get to Christ it's not by joining a church no by putting your name in a book known by being baptized or in immersing no how we get to into Christ is by one Holy Spirit we are all baptized into the promise the body and partakers of all belongs into the land that is how you get into Christ amen is be baptized into the promise into the body and be partakers of it and being placed perfectly in his body amen hearing a cry come out of her my people they may once you hear that voice of that eagle that said hey hey now that's it I'm coming out of there I'm coming out of that barnyard amen many times we we have a feeling in this whole world that hey we don't belong there's something on the inside that says I don't belong here as I was describing that eagle I don't feel at home here amen but the secret things belong to the Lord our God for those things which are revealed belonging to us and to our children forever and we may do all is in the world words of this law amen and in Ephesians 1 and 3 and it said say it like this blessed be to God and the father of the Lord Jesus Christ of whom have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we shall be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accept it in Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen aren't you glad that you've been baptized underneath the blood of the Lamb forgiveness for all of our sins now we can see he says having in verse 5 again says having predestinated us unto the adoption by the children of Jesus Christ to himself see many people they want to place themselves in a certain way they think that this is what it should be if I could just increase my financial status if I could just increase this that's not that that won't bring you out a mess and many people become rich and they get in worse of a mess amen but see God knew you from the foundation of the world he knew that you would be perfectly placed in him amen and brother Brandon would describe it in adoption it said those mothers as they would have in those children they would cry out Ephraim and they would place them in the word they would place them in their position and aren't you glad that you've been placed as you've been in this this place in time and God has placed you here but see now Joshua will come along and the Lord had blessed them and he knew where they needed to be placed perfectly in each of those places and so we would be placed perfectly into the word amen you see God knew us God knew us at the foundation and I want to read a quote here it says and how great is hazardous set some Churches through the labor pains oh get tremendous sometimes when the church is groaning under the persecution of outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us as it was in Pentecost how they grown Under The Cry of labor pains but when they were born they were positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set the church some Apostles some prophets some teachers some pastors some evangelist then he has given us into their speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing and all kinds of Miracles aren't you glad he's given the church those things amen and it didn't say ignorance in any of those things I thank the Lord for that aren't you amen I'm glad he gave us wisdom I'm glad he placed us perfectly in our positions here and you might and he goes on to say he says where the church is now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take someone else's Corner the church is trying to put people in a place or trying to take someone's else's position but don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're in Manassas you've got to take your your your place in Christ positionally taking it amen oh it gets deep and Rich when you get in here and how God puts one in the church that will speak in tongues and another and how we've been taught times that we all have to speak in tongues well that's wrong amen we all got to do it no we don't there you don't have to do just one thing amen aren't you glad that the Lord placed you in the exact position in where you need to be amen and maybe this is for somebody this morning maybe you've been dealing and struggling that well I've heard tongues in the church maybe I have to speak in tongues no no that that is given to certain people in the church interpretations given to certain people in the church and the best place to be out of the mess is by finding your exact position that you need to be in and that the Lord can deal with you in that position amen aren't you I'm glad that I don't have to speak in tongues and do all that but it's great when it happens but you be in your position you find your place amen I can't be brother Andrew I can't get up here and be almost playing a tennis match as I'm speaking I I just can't do that I can't be brother William Brother William can't be me amen none of us can be each other I mean we have to take your position in Christ amen don't create even more of a Mess by trying to do somebody else's position in the church hey man aren't you glad of that that I don't have to do their position in the church amen let me you take our brother Roy back here he found his position in the church that every time somebody walks into those doors greet him with a smile on a handshake he don't have to say much to him just greeting those he's been placed perfectly in his position and he has accepted that position amen you have been placed in your position to sing and worship and praise God I mean don't just sit there God is requiring worship of you he wants you to cry out he wants you to say oh Lord have mercy upon me amen he is our healer he is our way maker he is our savior amen aren't you glad of that this morning that's what he was he created you for see all of those attributes was in him and he knew you from the very beginning and he thought of you Amen brother William was even speaking on this last night and he read the first part of the quote and this morning I'm going to read the second part of this quote I just thought it was so perfect I thought well he's going to read the whole quote there for me but I want to read the the second part of this quote he says he says well well there was nothing to save nothing to heal but his attributes purposed it so then before the foundation of the world he knew he knowed that the great display in here of him and he would be a savior that he would come and be made flesh and dwelt amongst us and he know that he by his stripes we'd be healed he knew that he knew all of that from the foundation of the world he slayed the lamb in the book in his book before the foundation of the world and wrote your name in the book before the foundation of the world oh listen to this election looks back to foreknowledge and predestination looks to Destiny don't forget that that election looks back here here it is I was a cockleberry Amen brother Branham was describing himself I was a cocoa bird see I was born in sin I was shaping iniquity from the world speaking lies born amongst Sinners father and mother and all of my whole family sinners I was a kookaburra but all of a sudden I became a wheat grain amen and how did it happen oh what is that the election of God a cocklebur that has now become a grain of wheat now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved how do I do it look back and see he predestinated it long ago before the by foreknowledge he seen that I would love him now get this see by foreknowledge he seen that I would love him and so he made a perpetuation through his own son that through him I might become a kookaburr to a grain of wheat did you get that that he's seen that you would be accepting him that you would accept him amen so he elected you amen aren't you glad of that see see he knew us he foreseen Us in his foreknowledge so then he elected us besid because he said brother Shannon's going to accept me so bro if you if 15 years ago if you'd looked at brother Shannon sitting here he said that's a cocoa Bird right there you better watch that that sticker right there will get you hey man that's the same way we all was we wasn't all wheat when we came in here amen I know there's coat hangers hanging up back there but they ain't for your angel wings amen we all didn't come in as wheat this morning we was a bunch of cocoa Birds but see God knew that hey this group of people in this time would accept me amen they would be accepting to come out of that mess they would recognize the mess that they had made the mess that they was in and they'd asked forgiveness for the sin and they'd come out of that amen and become a grain of wheat amen election is the act of picking out of choosing used and active of God's Free Will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to certain persons decree made made from a choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ by grace aren't you glad that you're elected this morning that he chose you to be a special bride picked you and he predestinated you and pro destination and says it like this says determined before I bet aren't you glad that he predestinated you this morning amen to predetermine or to decide beforehand in the New Testament and God decreeing from The Eternity to foreordained appointed beforehand oh I I'm glad he predestinated me this morning I'm glad that I can now look back at everything that I was it now God's not he won't wipe it all and the devil will continue to remind you but you say none but I can look back and I say my path was positionally placed perfectly placed and what that did would put me in this position right now amen he he didn't give me just some flowery bit of ease to walk up on all the days of my life he said but everything you're going to go through is going to mold you to where you are right now amen aren't you glad that that you can look back and you say those trials oh they're they're like gold hey man those trials that I walk through I can look back and I say hey what that did for me there is the reason why I'm standing right here this morning oh I I'm so glad of that I'm so glad of that this morning that I can be placed in that position that was predestinated and now I can look into my destiny aren't you glad I can look into my destiny this morning and I can read in God's word and he can say hey there's a Temple that's waiting for you over here my destiny says that what I am now is I'm going to be a whole lot better there oh I can look to my destiny this morning oh and each and every one of us can look to that this morning our destiny that is just a hit and all that that something that's groaning on the inside of us and and we're just groaning and said I just cannot stay here I can't please bring me forth to my destiny Oh Glory Hallelujah I'm so glad of that this morning see he chose chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us into the adoption of the children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasures of his will oh I I think the Lord of that through his good will it wasn't nothing that I could do I'm glad that I didn't have to take those stripes at pilate's judgment Hall I'm glad he took those strikes for me this morning amen he died for you he took all of that because he knew you amen he knew that from the foundation of the world I'm going to send my son down that he's going to take it and be a savior for them amen that shed blood amen amen and David would say it like this in Psalms 139 and verse 7. he says whether I should go from the thy Spirit or whether I shall flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into the heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there the hand Lead Me thy right hand shall hold me if I say surely the darkness shall cover me amen that I want to hide in a dark place well even the night shall be light about thee because he is there amen yea Darkness hideth not from thee but the light shineth just as day because when he's there all Darkness flees amen for he is the light darkness and day are both alike in thee for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and my soul knoweth the right way amen aren't you glad that he is there this morning Amen in Ezekiel would say it like this in the name of the city from that day shall be the Lord is there he is in Hebrew Jehovah shama the Lord is there aren't you glad that he is there with you this morning said the Lord is there amen as David would say it he said oh if I would make my bed in hell the Lord is there oh if I should rise up into the heavens the Lord is there if I shall go into a dark place the Lord is there he is Jehovah shama this morning amen how do you get out of a Mess by being in the Lord because the Lord is there when you was born in a mess the Lord was there when you was raised in a mess the Lord was there he is your Jehovah shama this morning the Lord is there amen aren't you glad of that that the Lord is there with you this morning wherever you go the Lord is there amen and Charles Spurgeon would say it like this and the musicians can come this is going to be one of my last quotes that I read for you this morning aren't you glad that the Lord is there for you amen Charles Spurgeon would say it like this he said take this and you put it up on your Workshop take this I want you this and you put it upon your refrigerators put it up on your walls upon your bulletin board and you say Jehovah shama for the Lord is there amen what a glorious State this world was in at the very first in the age of paradise for the Lord was there oh glorious Creator having taken the first days of the week to make the world and fit it up for man did not bring forth his dear child unto the house it was built and furnished and supplied until all for all of his happiness did not put him in the garden to dress it up till the Roses were blooming and the fruits were ripe when the table was furnished he introduced his guest by saying let us make man in our own image after our likeness and the Lord put man not to be an a re-un unreclaimed plot of soul where he must hunger till he could produce a harvest but unto the Eden of delights where he was at home with the creatures of every sort to attend to him he had not the what he had not to water the dry lands nor need to thirst of himself for he had Rivers flowed Four Rivers flowed through his Royal domain rippled over the Sands of gold I might say so much of this Fair Garden of innocence and Bliss but the Blessed thing I could say that the Lord was there the Lord Our God Walked In the Garden in the cool of the night and communed with man and man being innocent held high Converse with the conceding maker the top Stone of the Bless The Paradise was all comprehending privilege the Lord was there see he walked with Adam with man at the beginning of the time because the Lord was there and alash alas that has vanished withered are the Boars of Eden the trail of the serpent is all over the landscape however Fair so so think back to that you was born in a mess and how the mess is now even worse than it was before but he would say it like this yet days of Mercy came God Saints in driver's places found Choice spots where they could Converse in heaven they found a place where the Lord would be there in the first days of the gracious God spake with his chosen ones in there he would daily walk with Enoch and under the oak as Abraham or by the Brook with Jacob or before the bush of Moses or near the wall City wall with Joshua wherever it might be the place become the Gate of Heaven for the Lord was there amend the tort torrent of sin and sorrow there may cross the stream of time upon the stepping zones of the places marked Jehovah Shama the Lord Delights wherewith the son of men to them nothing brought such a bliss as to find that still the Lord would be mindful of man and visit him Jehovah shama the Lord is there amen aren't you glad of that this morning that you can now say the Lord is there he is our Jehovah shama amen he brought me
