[55:08] here at the same time and so
[55:10] i told him that we would pray for them
[55:12] again as i
[55:14] as i take the pulpit this morning
[55:17] many needs that are among us and we know
[55:20] god's a healer
[55:21] he's not diminished his power one
[55:24] little iota when he saves the most
[55:29] wicked sinner in the world it does not
[55:32] diminish his grace
[55:34] none
[55:38] none when he heals even to the point of
[55:42] death it does not diminish his power to
[55:45] heal
[55:47] none it's not like your bank account
[55:50] that when you write a check
[55:51] something comes out
[55:55] hallelujah god
[55:59] is unlimited in his power
[56:05] it is we that limit him but he's
[56:08] unlimited
[56:10] in his power amen
[56:13] amen his disciples asked him to
[56:18] teach them how to pray
[56:21] and i would say if there's anybody
[56:25] that could teach us how to pray god
[56:28] himself could teach us how to pray
[56:34] and i'd like for you to read this with
[56:35] me this morning and then we'll go
[56:37] forward in a word
[56:39] after this manna pray ye
[56:42] our father which art in heaven
[56:45] hallowed be thy name thy kingdom
[56:49] come thy will be done in earth as it is
[56:52] in heaven
[56:53] give us this day our daily bread
[56:57] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[56:59] our debtors
[57:01] and lead us not into temptation
[57:04] but deliver us from evil for thine is
[57:07] the kingdom
[57:08] and the power and the glory forever

[58:14] that you would come and touch their
[58:15] bodies
[58:16] hands have been raised all across this
[58:19] building
[58:20] all through the internet audience we ask
[58:22] you that you'd send your word
[58:24] and as i stand behind this pulpit this
[58:27] morning
[58:27] i ask you that you touch my own body
[58:30] father
[58:31] lord do a work dear god we tell the
[58:34] devil

[58:38] the eternal word of god that
[58:42] never that it never fails
[58:45] and we pray that you'd speak to our
[58:47] hearts and
[58:48] in jesus christ's name we thank you for
[58:50] this presence today
[58:52] amen and amen and amen amen you can be
[58:55] seated this morning
[58:59] i'd like to speak to you this morning
[59:01] and and for those that heard
[59:03] when we were at brother paul's on
[59:04] saturday night i just took a portion of
[59:07] this and we will go forward with it
[59:12] god is committed
[59:16] god is committed and understand
[59:20] god never has a thought and then has to
[59:24] change it
[59:27] he never wrote a scripture and then
[59:28] later on amended it
[59:33] are you with me now man's thoughts
[59:36] change man's thoughts
[59:39] differ with the ages of opinions but
[59:42] god's word
[59:43] is eternal
[59:46] brother brandon would use the term many
[59:48] times heaven and earth
[59:50] will pass away but my word will
[59:54] never pass away so where would i rather
[59:58] be
[59:58] at in heaven or in earth
[1:00:01] or in his word his word
[1:00:05] is eternal
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:09] the scripture says in saint john chapter
[1:00:11] 14 and verse 20
[1:00:13] at that day ye shall know that i am in
[1:00:16] my father
[1:00:17] and ye and me and i in
[1:00:20] you sometimes we diminish the thought
[1:00:25] that jesus must be in heaven
[1:00:27] but he's inside of you so he has not
[1:00:31] lost his power any
[1:00:34] sometimes we look for a physical
[1:00:36] corporal body of jesus christ
[1:00:39] and it's coming but he's living
[1:00:42] on the inside of you
[1:00:46] psalms chapter 8 118 and verse 22
[1:00:49] the stone which the builders refused
[1:00:53] it's become the head of the corner
[1:00:57] this is the lord's doing
[1:01:00] and it is marvelous in our eyes we heard
[1:01:03] about a god in action last night this
[1:01:07] is the day which the lord hath made
[1:01:10] and we will rejoice and be glad in it
[1:01:14] if we could understand that we're
[1:01:16] literally
[1:01:17] living out the vision of god today
[1:01:22] we think of a vision being fulfilled
[1:01:24] like 42-inch caribou horns
[1:01:27] exactly and they still remain the same
[1:01:31] and that vision was fulfilled brother
[1:01:33] ray if me and you to stand there we'd
[1:01:34] have been
[1:01:35] shouting hallelujah when we saw that
[1:01:37] 42-inch
[1:01:38] like brother biscuit was shouting
[1:01:42] or the silvertip grizzly bear where only
[1:01:45] moments before
[1:01:47] brother bud sawflix said i could see for
[1:01:49] miles
[1:01:50] but i i i don't see it and they knew but
[1:01:53] according to the vision before they got
[1:01:56] back
[1:01:56] down to the tent that that grizzly bear
[1:01:59] had to be killed not just a grizzly bear
[1:02:01] but silver tipped grizzly bear
[1:02:05] one which bud sophomore could never sing
[1:02:07] before and he said i can see for miles
[1:02:09] and brother brad i'm asking
[1:02:10] are you doubting the vision bud
[1:02:13] sometimes we need to even ask ourselves
[1:02:16] are we doubting the vision
[1:02:17] [Applause]
[1:02:19] we're sitting in a service where god is
[1:02:22] moving
[1:02:22] and getting us ready just before the
[1:02:24] rapture
[1:02:27] are we doubting what god's doing among
[1:02:32] us
[1:02:34] are you with me in ephesians chapters
[1:02:38] 2 and verse 8 it says for by grace
[1:02:41] you are saved through faith and that not
[1:02:44] of yourselves
[1:02:46] it is the gift of god not of
[1:02:49] works less than any man should boast
[1:02:53] you couldn't do nothing to save yourself
[1:02:56] now notice these next words for we are
[1:03:00] his workmanship
[1:03:05] now let's remember what his workmanship
[1:03:08] is just for a moment
[1:03:10] in the beginning god created the heavens
[1:03:13] and the earth
[1:03:14] and he spoke the word from that logos of
[1:03:17] light and he believed his own word
[1:03:22] and the son came into existence and
[1:03:25] brother brahm said the clickers would
[1:03:27] fall off the sun
[1:03:28] and god would watch them for so long
[1:03:31] maybe
[1:03:31] millions of years and he would stop them
[1:03:34] just in the right place
[1:03:35] because he was writing his first bible
[1:03:38] god believed his own word
[1:03:42] are you with me he didn't get us here to
[1:03:44] quit believing his own word
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:48] he didn't get us this far to lose us
[1:03:52] he didn't get us this far to quit on us
[1:03:57] somebody help me preach now
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:04:01] for we are his workmanship so let's
[1:04:05] take him at his word god's not a liar
[1:04:09] and when god saved you and brooded over
[1:04:12] you how many remember that
[1:04:13] when god began to brood over you and you
[1:04:16] went looking for god god came looking
[1:04:18] for you
[1:04:19] maybe you were in a bar room maybe you
[1:04:21] were in a dead church
[1:04:22] god began to deal in your life and begin
[1:04:26] to pull on you
[1:04:28] you couldn't reach up to god god came
[1:04:31] rich down to you
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:38] moved your life in a certain way that
[1:04:40] you'd be sitting here today
[1:04:42] are you with me the devil don't make you
[1:04:45] sit here
[1:04:48] he didn't put that in your heart to
[1:04:50] serve god and want more of god
[1:04:53] brother jason he put something in your
[1:04:55] heart to thirst and
[1:04:56] hunger for god and more of god more of
[1:04:59] god and more of god
[1:05:00] that ain't the devil that's doing that
[1:05:04] god's at work he's
[1:05:07] at work and the inside of you he's not
[1:05:10] dormant he's at work
[1:05:25] remember he's the great provider
[1:05:31] jesus is standing with his disciples
[1:05:34] in saint john chapter 14.
[1:05:40] you know jesus walked in two worlds at
[1:05:42] the same time
[1:05:45] you hear brother branham use this text
[1:05:47] this thought
[1:05:49] he says now i'm standing in two worlds
[1:05:53] at the same time how many of you ever
[1:05:56] come to a service like this morning
[1:05:59] and you walk out and you just you just
[1:06:01] feel like you've been lifted
[1:06:03] and all of your problems are nothing
[1:06:08] they're just they're just evaporated all
[1:06:11] the petty things of life is just
[1:06:13] just nothing all the personal
[1:06:16] relationships are just nothing now
[1:06:18] and god just lifts you into another
[1:06:20] realm
[1:06:27] jesus said let not your heart be
[1:06:29] troubled
[1:06:31] you believe in god believe also in me
[1:06:37] in my father's house
[1:06:40] are many mansions
[1:06:49] are you with me
[1:06:52] you're standing here you're grey-headed
[1:06:54] you're needing glasses
[1:06:57] your body is debilitating and god's
[1:06:59] already got it taken care of
[1:07:04] amen he's already got it taken care of
[1:07:08] and you're you're looking at your mortal
[1:07:10] flesh
[1:07:11] and you're sometimes humiliated by your
[1:07:14] mortal flesh
[1:07:15] maybe your memory doesn't work quite
[1:07:17] right or
[1:07:18] you can't have a conversation even quite
[1:07:22] right or
[1:07:23] and you knew what you used to be you
[1:07:26] know what you used to be capable of
[1:07:29] and and yet god has it got it all in
[1:07:32] control
[1:07:33] at the same time
[1:07:34] [Applause]
[1:07:37] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:07:39] and
[1:07:40] and if it were not so i would tell you
[1:07:45] i and if i go and prepare a place for
[1:07:48] you
[1:07:50] i will come again and receive you
[1:07:53] unto myself that where i am
[1:07:59] there ye may be also
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] and whether i go you know and the way
[1:08:06] that you know
[1:08:08] and thomas saith unto him lord we know
[1:08:10] not whether
[1:08:11] thou go us and how can we know the way
[1:08:14] and jesus
[1:08:15] he gave the eternal prescription right
[1:08:18] here
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:21] i am the way not one of the ways
[1:08:28] i am the way the truth
[1:08:32] and the life
[1:08:35] and no man cometh unto the father but
[1:08:38] by me and if you had known
[1:08:42] me you should have known my father also
[1:08:46] and from henceforth you know him
[1:08:49] and have seen him and i just want to say
[1:08:53] this right here
[1:08:55] that same personal god is in the
[1:08:57] building this morning
[1:08:59] and this message is more than books and
[1:09:02] tapes and pictures and
[1:09:04] stories and and analogies of other
[1:09:07] people
[1:09:07] this message is christ being personally
[1:09:11] revealed to you
[1:09:13] as an individual and he has such a way
[1:09:16] to make
[1:09:17] your experience personal
[1:09:20] that nobody else has one like it
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:26] why brother ron god is committed to you
[1:09:34] now brother brahman says in things that
[1:09:35] are to be and this is a sermon of two
[1:09:37] worlds
[1:09:38] it's a prophecy he says you were
[1:09:42] all pre-planned by god
[1:09:46] nothing happens by chance with god
[1:09:50] he knows all about it it's all
[1:09:53] pre-planned
[1:09:54] planned for the many generations back
[1:09:58] so that you could be here tonight
[1:10:07] did you know that just think
[1:10:11] that you at one time and he said i'll
[1:10:13] repeat this again you at one time was in
[1:10:15] your father
[1:10:17] in the gene of your father now he didn't
[1:10:20] know you at the time
[1:10:23] and neither did you know him at the time
[1:10:26] but you see
[1:10:27] then you were put into the bedding
[1:10:30] ground in the womb of your mother
[1:10:32] through holy wedrock and then you become
[1:10:35] a
[1:10:35] person expressed in the image like your
[1:10:38] father
[1:10:40] then there's fellowship
[1:10:44] and brother brandon is talking about the
[1:10:46] human aspect now
[1:10:49] but now he's going to go to another
[1:10:50] level now the only way that you can be a
[1:10:53] son or daughter of god is because you
[1:10:55] have to
[1:10:56] have eternal life
[1:11:00] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:11:02] life
[1:11:03] and that's god's life
[1:11:09] only one form of eternal life and it's
[1:11:12] god's life
[1:11:14] we could repeat that over and over and
[1:11:16] over again
[1:11:18] to be a son of god you had to be
[1:11:22] in him always
[1:11:28] brother on we've heard that a thousand
[1:11:29] times did we get it
[1:11:36] did we get it did we get it
[1:11:41] because let me just say this to you how
[1:11:43] many times in our
[1:11:44] normal daily walk does satan make us
[1:11:48] feel like
[1:11:49] you're backslid
[1:11:53] god don't love you you might as well
[1:11:56] walk away
[1:11:58] why don't you quit
[1:12:02] because he knows if you get this quote
[1:12:04] right here
[1:12:07] that if you ever was in god it isn't you
[1:12:11] holding on it's god holding on to you
[1:12:21] hallelujah
[1:12:26] i said this at paul's i've said it here
[1:12:28] before if you could you'd walk away
[1:12:32] because you can't hold yourself
[1:12:35] but there's something holding you
[1:12:39] it's eternal life
[1:12:42] there's no end to it
[1:12:48] glory
[1:12:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:12:59] so the next moment you're having a real
[1:13:01] dark moment
[1:13:02] remind the devil of that spot i was with
[1:13:05] god
[1:13:06] in the beginning
[1:13:11] hallelujah and if god ever thought of me
[1:13:14] he's committed to me
[1:13:25] notice this quote when god makes a
[1:13:29] promise to you
[1:13:31] he will fulfill it
[1:13:36] you're taking your time brother ron yeah
[1:13:38] because i want you to get this
[1:13:40] when god makes a promise to you he
[1:13:44] will fulfill it you don't have to be
[1:13:48] afraid that he will
[1:13:49] not keep his word for god
[1:13:52] will keep his word
[1:13:58] deep call it to the deep you've watched
[1:14:00] it many times he says now you know
[1:14:02] that when the deep cost to the deep
[1:14:04] there's got to be a deep to respond to
[1:14:06] it
[1:14:10] and there's got to he said you believe
[1:14:12] that don't you david said when the deep
[1:14:15] calleth to the deep in other words like
[1:14:18] this
[1:14:19] before something can be calling out for
[1:14:22] something
[1:14:23] there has to be something out there for
[1:14:26] this
[1:14:27] in here to be calling to
[1:14:32] now in other words i've made this
[1:14:35] statement before
[1:14:37] before there was a fin on a fish's
[1:14:40] back isn't that so simple
[1:14:46] he's standing in washington d.c
[1:14:50] at one of the most prestigious halls
[1:14:54] and he's telling america
[1:14:57] what's the secret to success
[1:15:00] and how big god is and yet it was so
[1:15:04] simple before there was a fin on a
[1:15:08] fish's back
[1:15:11] there had to be water first for him to
[1:15:15] swim
[1:15:15] in or he wouldn't have to have a fin
[1:15:20] he had never had to have a fin if there
[1:15:23] was no water
[1:15:24] before there could be a tree to grow on
[1:15:26] the earth there has to be an earth there
[1:15:29] first
[1:15:30] or there had been no tree to grow
[1:15:33] in why are you here
[1:15:38] there's a deep calling to the deep.
[1:15:47] let me just put it in real simple
[1:15:48] language
[1:15:50] for the bride of jesus christ we're not
[1:15:52] too nervous about everything that the
[1:15:53] world's going through
[1:15:57] the world is falling apart
[1:16:00] it's supposed to our
[1:16:04] government does not have an answer
[1:16:10] education doesn't have an answer
[1:16:13] science doesn't have an answer
[1:16:18] i got the pfizer shocked then i'm going
[1:16:21] supposed to get another one this week
[1:16:24] and now that we're hearing that there's
[1:16:25] going to be another one after that one
[1:16:27] and then there's another one after that
[1:16:29] one that might go on forever
[1:16:33] until one day i don't make the
[1:16:34] appointment
[1:16:36] because i've been raptured
[1:16:48] in the media you can tell that they're
[1:16:50] afraid to even say
[1:16:51] anything one way or another
[1:16:55] because there's some power that's white
[1:16:58] black pink
[1:16:58] yellow there's some voice out there
[1:17:02] is going to get their job
[1:17:04] [Applause]
[1:17:06] and people can't even make an open
[1:17:08] statement without fear of
[1:17:10] of somebody taking their job or a right
[1:17:13] to break up
[1:17:16] it's because the world has fallen apart
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:26] but i find it amazing that god's word is
[1:17:29] so
[1:17:30] eternal he makes a statement
[1:17:35] and he never has to apologize for it
[1:17:39] he tells women how to dress in
[1:17:41] deuteronomy
[1:17:43] and he never has to change it
[1:17:45] [Applause]
[1:17:49] tells men how to behave and he never has
[1:17:52] to change it
[1:17:53] men be men women be women
[1:18:06] husbands love your wife as christ
[1:18:09] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:18:13] gives you the best description of how to
[1:18:15] run your marriage

[1:30:55] complected
[1:30:56] shoulder-length hair

[1:31:25] and i've seen it for 30 plus years of
[1:31:28] ministry
[1:31:31] that when brother branham was standing
[1:31:32] on the pulpit
[1:31:34] and a stubborn devil wouldn't leave he

[1:31:49] brother ron how can you believe brother
[1:31:50] branham he was there by himself
[1:31:53] well can we believe mary
[1:32:01] can we believe mary she's a teenage girl
[1:32:05] and she meets an angel and the scripture
[1:32:08] had
[1:32:09] been prophecy had been foretold 800
[1:32:12] years
[1:32:14] and a lot of families thought that their
[1:32:15] daughter was going to be that chosen one
[1:32:18] and she's not in the who's who but the
[1:32:20] angel meets her
[1:32:22] and she takes him at the word
[1:32:26] but that was brother branham that was
[1:32:27] mary what about you
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:32] president wasn't there when god called
[1:32:34] you
[1:32:36] and he began to deal with you and maybe
[1:32:38] you was in a room all alone
[1:32:40] or maybe you was in a church with 500
[1:32:42] people they didn't get what you got
[1:32:44] you walked to the archer
[1:32:48] and god met you because he's committed
[1:32:54] and then brother branham said god
[1:32:56] ignites that seed on the inside of you
[1:32:59] and then every devil in hell will try to
[1:33:01] talk you out of it

[1:41:38] names i can't say abraham
[1:41:41] david joseph there are identifiable
[1:41:44] scriptures that have a
[1:41:46] personality character went with them and
[1:41:48] there was a time date that was with them
[1:41:50] and they lived their life and they were
[1:41:51] that book they were that epistle of that
[1:41:54] age
