[1:14] next thing you know we're going through
[1:17] the parlor of the hotel and brother

[1:43] about 350 for the angel of the Lord woke
[1:47] me up and I felt this presence in the
[1:49] room and I looked to the clock it was
[1:52] 354 and about that time the Holy Spirit
[1:55] swept over my body and a voice spoke to
[1:57] me and said I was sent from the presence
[2:00] of God to strengthen you in your body
[2:03] and spirit and to touch your voice
[2:07] hallelujah
[2:09] I felt the charge of the Holy Ghost came
[2:12] over my body

[2:47] an honor to be here and to join alliance
[2:51] with Brenner on and another ambassador
[2:53] and general and in the Lord's army and I
[2:57] felt compelled by God to answer these
[3:00] meetings and just for the last two weeks
[3:03] God has been dealing with me and my wife
[3:05] is a witness I would tell her of
[3:07] supernatural things that will happen in
[3:09] these meetings you can meet with her
[3:11] privately and she will share those
[3:13] things with you exactly the way to
[3:15] happened last night those of you know
[3:17] were here last night
[3:19] I want to tell you you were in a divine
[3:21] plan define appointment by the Holy
[3:25] Spirit heaven already knew about it
[3:27] there was no mishap to last night's
[3:30] service now I believe this morning is
[3:32] going to bless this one more time

[3:36] pulling on the word I believe will
[3:38] preach herself right into a body change
[3:40] by the help of the Lord may God bless
[3:42] you on on thirsty we we came in on
[3:46] Thursday evening spend a little time
[3:48] with brother on and sister Connie and
[3:50] then they planned a little time of
[3:53] relaxation for us on Friday before we
[3:56] head into the meetings and what a lovely
[3:58] time we had I certainly appreciate that
[4:00] brother Ron to see the president a home
[4:04] and such like Thomas Jefferson that
[4:08] certainly was an honor to go there and
[4:09] see all those things we came back to the
[4:11] house and it was a little late tonight
[4:13] my spirit was sort of roaming and I'd
[4:16] already had a direction that God was
[4:18] taking me in and pretty much everything
[4:21] in the
[4:21] right line up but somewhere about
[4:23] midnight the presence of God swept in
[4:26] the room and says I want you to preach
[4:27] the climax message tomorrow night that's
[4:30] an okay God whatever you want me to do
[4:32] normally a message I preached at a
[4:34] climax but I'm so thankful not even
[4:37] thinking about it
[4:37] do you realize we were here four and a
[4:40] half hours last night God knew exactly
[4:43] what he was doing because there were
[4:45] some needs in this place it couldn't
[4:47] wait until today God switched the sermon
[4:50] and give us a climax last night and I
[4:52] believe he'll do it again this morning
[4:54] god bless you we love you this morning
[4:56] appreciate all of you invite you to go
[4:58] with me now in the book of Joshua

[5:24] services and taking the bullets for me
[5:27] and pressing on and and I sort of stole
[5:30] him away this weekend so they'll

[5:57] of you I want you to I want you to relax
[6:00] this morning even oh it's gonna be well
[6:02] in Jesus name i prophesy on this service
[6:06] great things are going to happen you
[6:07] know why the wise Solomon said the cria
[6:10] thing in a shack on the pass the words
[6:13] of prophecies are within our mouths this
[6:15] morning I speak life over this church in
[6:17] Jesus name Joshua chapter 6 very old
[6:21] familiar paths Joshua now the general
[6:25] after Moses God an appointed Joshua a
[6:29] type of the Holy Ghost to bring the
[6:32] Israelites over we
[6:34] see how that Moses had prepared the
[6:37] people through the laws and brought the
[6:41] law to the people and the covenants and
[6:44] established them to the Israelites but
[6:48] then God moved the Moses off the scene
[6:50] and raised up a Joshua and we noticed
[6:53] that under the Joshua Commission we saw
[6:57] how the Joshua was a man of Valor a
[7:00] mighty man a man that knew how to war a
[7:04] man that knew his enemy he knew how to
[7:07] go in and come out before his enemies
[7:10] and in verses 1 now Joshua or Jericho
[7:14] rather was straightly shut up because of
[7:17] the turn of Israel none went out and
[7:21] none came in
[7:23] isn't it amazing of the Bride of Christ
[7:26] can shut down an entire city realize the
[7:30] power of God is within us that we can
[7:33] cause an entire city to be shut down
[7:35] completely and the Lord said unto Joshua
[7:39] see I have given into 9 hand Jericho and
[7:42] the kings and the king thereof and the
[7:46] mighty men of valor and he shall come
[7:48] past the city or the man of war and go
[7:53] around the city once thus shalt thou do
[7:56] six days and seven priests shall bare
[8:02] before the ark seven trumpets of rams
[8:05] horns and saying the seventh day he
[8:10] shall compassed the city seven times and
[8:15] presa blow with the trumpets and it came
[8:20] to pass that when they made a long blast
[8:23] with the ram's horn and when he hear the
[8:28] sound of the trumpet all the people
[8:31] shall shout with a great shout and the
[8:34] wall of the city shall fall flat and the
[8:39] people shall the sin of every man
[8:42] straight before him and Joshua a son on
[8:46] call the
[8:48] and selling to them take up the Ark of
[8:51] the Covenant and let's seven priests
[8:55] there are seven trumpets of rams horns
[8:59] before the Ark of the Lord just for the
[9:04] sake of time I like to drop down to
[9:06] verses 10 and Joshua commanded the
[9:09] people saying he shall not shout nor
[9:14] make any noise with your voice neither
[9:18] shall any word proceed out of your mouth
[9:21] until the day I bid you shout then shall
[9:27] I shout this is very ironic isn't it
[9:31] this is quite a contrast isn't it
[9:34] at one time God is telling the people
[9:36] who shouts out another time he's telling
[9:39] the people to shut up hello somebody
[9:42] cannot bridge this morning you see you
[9:45] got to know what a shouts and you gotta
[9:48] know what'll be solids will help us
[9:52] Jesus turn to your neighbor right now
[9:55] listen neighbor we are gonna make some
[9:59] sound in this place in verses 20 so the
[10:05] people shouted when the priests blew
[10:07] with the trumpets and it came to pass
[10:10] when the people heard the sound of the
[10:13] trumpet that the people shouted with a
[10:15] great shout that the wall fell down flat
[10:19] so the people went up into the city
[10:22] every man straight before him and they
[10:26] watch they took the city there were no
[10:31] spectators in the church that did not
[10:34] come to see who shouted last night's
[10:36] that one there to sit in the seat of the
[10:39] scornful they went in the house of God
[10:42] and their chip their inheritance glory

[12:36] Elijah looked out and says where's your
[12:39] God where's your God in the Bible says
[12:44] that he lied to repair the altar
[12:46] hallelujah I'm so glad that he lied to
[12:48] repair the altar in this age I'm so glad
[12:51] at the altar has been restored in the

[13:29] he lives his said unto a hat get the up
[13:32] eat and drink for there is a sound of
[13:36] abundance of rain there is a sound out
[13:42] of abundance of rain I like to speak to
[13:47] you this morning on a thought sounding
[13:52] off your victories sounding off your
[13:56] victories let us pray our Heavenly
[13:59] Father would deem it such a grand
[14:02] privilege to be with the body of Christ
[14:05] once again we would just ask that you
[14:08] will take preeminence now in this
[14:11] service and may your divine presence
[14:14] just set across this audience Lord and
[14:17] may it be such a holy hush of your glory
[14:23] they'll sweep in this place that they'll
[14:26] not be a person under the sound of my
[14:29] voice that will not witness the presence
[14:33] and know that you've been here I pray
[14:36] God that your Holy Spirit will take its
[14:38] place now as we're settling in a bit if
[14:41] we've engaged the Scriptures I pray that
[14:44] you will now engage the anointing in the
[14:47] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[14:49] church says amen before you see the
[14:53] turnaround to your neighbor and shake
[14:56] your hands and you may be seated
[15:11] you appreciate him something off your
[15:17] victories in a message just to give a
[15:20] backdrop and the bill for a bad platform
[15:23] uncertain sound red Ram said Jesus
[15:27] sounded his trumpet he sold them by his
[15:31] signs and wonders that he was the
[15:34] Messiah yes sir the Christian soldier is
[15:38] strained to hear the word sound of the
[15:42] gospel the real Christian soldier is
[15:46] strain to that you see Jesus had a sound
[15:53] about him that was different than the
[15:57] sounds that was around him he had a
[16:00] distinction and a sound that didn't
[16:04] sound like the Pharisees and the
[16:06] Sadducees and the religious people of
[16:09] that day his sound was different than
[16:14] the people of this time in a message
[16:17] returned in Jubilee the Prophet said
[16:20] it's time to rise the sons of God in the
[16:24] name of Jesus Christ and the rise to the
[16:27] place so you can return to this Jubilee
[16:31] and hear the sound of the trumpet of the
[16:34] gospel of the word of God now your
[16:39] sounds your words have power the power
[16:47] is in the word that you speak I want you
[16:52] to think about the power of one's voice
[16:54] this morning and remember in the case it
[17:00] will go back in the Old Testament in the
[17:02] case of Cain and Abel God said that the
[17:06] voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto
[17:10] me from the ground that even though that
[17:15] Abel had died in the flesh
[17:18] there was still a power of God within
[17:22] the blood of a Son of God there was a
[17:26] sound that cried into the heavens that
[17:30] reached into the throne of God it was a
[17:33] sound that was so different that even in
[17:41] death the Bible says that it was voice
[17:44] was still alive because God's blood
[17:46] cannot be killed
[17:48] you see it's still rippled through the
[17:51] heavens he could not have been stopped
[17:54] Cain may have tried to destroy that seed
[17:58] but he could not destroy that life that
[18:01] blood the sound that was in that scene
[18:05] of God Abel and even that he died his
[18:10] voice the voice of his blood riffled
[18:13] into the heavenly bread and said there's
[18:18] again a lot of people in land two
[18:20] hundred their message will be the final
[18:23] voice to the final age you see the power
[18:27] of one's voice that voice has power to
[18:31] change the circumstances and situations
[18:35] from defeat into victories this morning
[18:39] or from victories to failures now I want
[18:46] to ask you a question I like to pose
[18:47] this question to you this morning how do
[18:50] you use the power of your voice
[18:53] what are you sounding off this morning
[18:56] the creative power of God is in your
[19:00] mouth today the creative power God is
[19:05] within our mouths and you release the
[19:09] creative power of God by the spoken word
[19:11] you see it all hinges back to a sound
[19:16] sound is powerful this morning sound is
[19:21] captivating today sound will bring you
[19:27] into your position of
[19:30] three today when you release the
[19:33] creative power of God by the spoken word
[19:36] understand that the creative abilities
[19:38] of God I released sir by the sound of
[19:42] words the sound of words releases the
[19:47] creative ability of God within us God's
[19:51] creation is within my bodies the power
[19:54] of God lies within our bodies and
[19:58] creation is released by the sound of her
[20:02] words sound has power we go back and we
[20:09] can give the account of creation and
[20:11] it's all about sound
[20:13] he said God spoke things into existence
[20:18] amen the sound of God's voice cause
[20:21] action and reaction when God spoke the
[20:27] sound that went out of God out of God
[20:30] went forth the logos are the spirit that
[20:34] word that said let there be and there
[20:38] was a power of creation in the sound I
[20:41] was worse and God said let there be
[20:45] light and out of God even emanated a
[20:49] sound and the sound went out into the
[20:52] world and begin to create by the sound
[20:56] of God's voice God spoke things into
[21:00] existence yes the sound of God's voice
[21:04] causes actions and reactions you see
[21:09] sound isn't just used for communication
[21:12] this morning we understand from Genesis
[21:16] that God uses sounds for creation God
[21:21] sets atmosphere and things by the tool
[21:27] of sounds
[21:29] sounds sets the atmosphere and mood of a
[21:34] place you can walk into a restaurant at
[21:40] a certain time whether you're having
[21:43] breakfast or lunch or a fine dining in
[21:47] the evening they know how to manipulate
[21:50] the sound of the music to create the
[21:53] atmosphere and a mood to bring their
[21:57] audience into captivity sounds have the
[22:01] ability to captivate our minds and
[22:04] spirits can you say man you see we
[22:12] underestimate the power of sounds so we
[22:16] fail to investigate its importance this
[22:20] morning so weakness begins to permeate
[22:24] our lives it's time that we let sound
[22:30] reverberates in our life it is time that
[22:35] we allow sound to reverberate in our
[22:39] lives it's time that we allow ourselves
[22:42] to be healed to God and let sound begin
[22:46] to reverberate in our lives this morning
[22:50] you see sound pulls stuff out of you
[22:56] sound pull certain abilities out of your
[23:00] life
[23:01] sound pull out what is on the inside of
[23:05] you this morning by the power of sound
[23:09] you can captivate an audience
[23:12] aiming by that call of a name you can
[23:16] pull out stuff out of people's life
[23:19] hallelujah amen so sound pull stuff out
[23:24] of you this morning I have some
[23:27] grandchildren and when my little Adeline
[23:30] Kate is at the house I know just what to
[23:34] say to pull certain things out of her
[23:37] you see certain sound
[23:40] trolls hair by the things that I do when
[23:45] she hears the candy jar shakes you see
[23:50] sound pulls something out of her am i
[23:54] talking you this morning
[23:56] aimin when she hears our mama says
[23:59] Adeline cake Haltom it sets a different
[24:03] mood because that is the only time when
[24:08] we're trouble that our parents call us
[24:11] by our full names but you just see the
[24:14] sound it pulls stuff out of you I'm
[24:17] talking to you this morning come on
[24:20] communicate with me today hey man I'm
[24:23] gonna pull some stuff out of you this
[24:25] morning because sound cause stuff out of
[24:29] your lives is that correct
[24:32] you see something cause you know dance
[24:34] when you don't feel like dancing why do
[24:38] you think the world spends billions of
[24:40] dollars to outfit venues with mics and
[24:44] amplifiers and speakers they understand
[24:48] the power of sound this morning you see
[24:52] how problem is that our world has
[24:54] learned how to harness the power of
[24:57] sound more effectively than the children
[25:00] of God that's right and the usage
[25:03] imagine imagine sitting down and
[25:06] watching a movie without sound they know
[25:10] just how to bring the right sound into
[25:13] the right scenery because it works under
[25:16] human emotions it brings tears and
[25:19] brings sadness it brings joy and they
[25:22] know how to orchestrate the music to
[25:25] pull herself out of your life am I
[25:28] talking to you and God knows how to
[25:31] orchestrate a church by the sound of the
[25:35] preachers he knows when I bring in a
[25:38] high and a low
[25:39] Amen he knows how to change are the
[25:43] tunes and the keys within the body of
[25:45] Christ amen Millie you could sometimes
[25:49] you come into the church and and there's
[25:51] times you there's a melancholy
[25:54] that is upon you and sadly our gorgeous
[25:57] Thomas and Belle Ron comes appear and
[26:00] suddenly begins to break into an
[26:03] anointing and suddenly he drops into
[26:05] that channel of a certain sound and when
[26:08] he begins a sound off that specific
[26:11] sound on that spirit of Mellon colonist
[26:14] suddenly a man that Mellon colonists
[26:17] that thing is broken by the sound of his
[26:20] voice so as we move forward we need to
[26:26] learn some sound doctrines amen I'm here
[26:33] to pull some stuff out of you this
[26:34] morning a man we're gonna have some
[26:36] sound in the slice
[26:38] everybody say sound in verses Stan in

[57:22] the only ghost is in this place kakazu
[57:26] Cunha cassia
[57:27] got Makoku secrecy glory of God sell
[57:33] this house right now
[57:37] let me ship down for just a moment I
[57:40] want to point out to you that silence is
[57:44] supposed to be for a season I want you
[57:48] to know they'll have no issues with
[57:50] silence the wise Solomon said that it's
[57:54] a time for silence and a time to speak
[57:57] in fact one of my favorite verses in the
[58:00] Bible is revelations 8:1 it declares
[58:03] there will be silent in heaven for the
[58:06] space of 30 minutes but even in boats of
[58:10] those passages silence is a season
[58:15] Joshua's instructions were clear
[58:18] there was a time for silence six days of
[58:24] saying nothing six days of shut up but
[58:31] it was for a season tell somebody
[58:35] silence is only for a season are you
[58:43] there with me silence is just for a
[58:47] season hallelujah may God help us this
[58:51] morning in fact what I will tell you is
[58:54] that the silence was the birthplace of
[58:57] the shout oh did you catch it
[59:03] silence was the birthplace of the south
[59:07] when the Israelites got silence and
[59:10] burnin a shout and then the shouted what
[59:15] garden reveal was manifested in the
[59:19] shout oh my if some of us could just
[59:24] shut up for a few days we might actually
[59:26] have a shout burped within us hello
[59:33] hello somebody are you home I can't have
[59:38] Church with you you got mail you got
[59:45] mail if some of us were shut up for a
[59:49] little while but roughs i shout would be
[59:52] bursted in our spirits a man but you see
[59:58] my concern is that I think that too many
[1:00:00] of us have become locked in silence
[1:00:07] permanently permanently who praise the
[1:00:13] Lord the seven seas has been open in
[1:00:16] this church we know at the opening of
[1:00:19] the seven seals there was silence we
[1:00:23] just don't have to we don't need all
[1:00:25] that emotion and all that shouting and
[1:00:27] all that carrying on whose altar are you
[1:00:29] dancing on Balaam's are Elijah's hello
[1:00:36] whose altar are you dancing on Pelham's
[1:00:41] I relax us but many of us have become
[1:00:48] locked in silence season permanently you
[1:00:53] see the revelation from Jericho is that
[1:00:55] if there's no sound there's no victory
[1:00:57] too many of us have lost our sounds we
[1:01:01] have lost our sound so we have lost our
[1:01:03] victory we have no problem with holy
[1:01:06] hushes and appropriate reverence and
[1:01:10] what I do have problem with is silence
[1:01:13] when it becomes deadly
[1:01:18] come on church this church gets silent
[1:01:22] you better bury it
[1:01:23] hey man I got a problem when solids
[1:01:26] become deadly
[1:01:27] we got too many dead churches around the
[1:01:31] ranks of this message because I do
[1:01:33] silence silence
[1:01:37] I second preeminence over the people of
[1:01:41] God we have to know that silence is for
[1:01:46] a season you see your sound dictates
[1:01:50] your results your sound dictates your
[1:01:53] results without my sound this morning a
[1:01:56] man sounding the Prophet said god hiding
[1:01:58] revealing simplicity the complete Word
[1:02:01] of God rests within them at the very
[1:02:03] command at their own voice is creative
[1:02:07] power because in them is the Holy Ghost
[1:02:10] and this Holy Ghost as a creator he
[1:02:12] makes things come to pass because he
[1:02:15] speaks the word and the word spoken
[1:02:17] becomes God in action your sound
[1:02:25] dictates your results
[1:02:27] come on husband you know it is you can
[1:02:31] have you can have a moment of intense
[1:02:40] and your words can either break or make
[1:02:45] that argument you can choose to say you
[1:02:51] know I was wrong or you can choose to
[1:02:56] say I'm the man of this house I wear the
[1:03:00] pants what I hear a man say that I know
[1:03:02] he don't
[1:03:09] if you're wearing the pants why are you
[1:03:12] gonna tell somebody you got pants on
[1:03:14] they can see for themselves who's
[1:03:16] wearing the pants problem God said a
[1:03:24] woman ought to be on the authority of a
[1:03:25] man
[1:03:26] praise the Lord bless the Lord holy God
[1:03:28] you need to shut up and get reborn again
[1:03:31] by the Holy Ghost
[1:03:36] you see we sound the way in a victory
[1:03:38] but you silent your way into the feet
[1:03:42] many of God's people are living in
[1:03:44] impoverishment and defeatism because
[1:03:47] they fail the song of their victories
[1:03:50] you see you should have an overflow in
[1:03:54] your life this morning you shall have an
[1:03:57] overflow in your life do you believe it
[1:03:59] and you create overflow as you speak
[1:04:03] into existence things that are not
[1:04:08] father Abraham speak things that were
[1:04:11] not into existence he pulled it out of
[1:04:15] the celestial realm right into his
[1:04:17] dimension you believe it French you
[1:04:21] realize what you have need of is already
[1:04:24] in existence you got to reach into that
[1:04:27] celestial realm and drag it into this
[1:04:29] dimension you see your body is already
[1:04:33] healed because your spirits has already
[1:04:37] went into that dimension and see your
[1:04:39] perfect body
[1:04:40] it's just now waiting for that body of
[1:04:43] flesh to get caught up with the
[1:04:44] revelation that's on the other side
[1:04:47] hello somebody they even tell your body
[1:04:50] right now I'm healed notify your body
[1:04:53] healing it's on its wing notify your
[1:04:57] family restoration it's on its way
[1:05:02] I believe it friends I believe it's is
[1:05:05] this old body even sometimes you're
[1:05:07] trying to drag it along
[1:05:08] amen we're trying to just together to
[1:05:10] convince but my spirit already went into
[1:05:12] the spirit world and saw my deliverance
[1:05:14] I already crossed over into Canaan and
[1:05:17] saw the grace
[1:05:18] and I'm coming back to tell this body
[1:05:20] I'm sounding off my victory is alright
[1:05:30] with you this morning

[1:05:47] figment of the imagination
[1:05:48] that was just our that's just another
[1:05:50] service no it wasn't it was God I came
[1:05:53] now
[1:06:04] you see most of us never win the victory
[1:06:07] because we remain silent all the time
[1:06:10] you see you can remain locked out of
[1:06:13] your inheritance and bounty God has
[1:06:16] prepared for you if you fail the Sun off
[1:06:19] this morning
[1:06:19] in James 3 speaks of the power of the
[1:06:24] tongue
[1:06:25] you see you turn the whole body if you
[1:06:29] turn the tongue you have you you you you
[1:06:33] got to understand you have to get your
[1:06:36] tongue your tongue involved in the
[1:06:39] process of your victory

[1:06:55] tongue cancer your your the direction
[1:06:59] that you're going with so you got to get
[1:07:03] your tongue involved in the process of
[1:07:05] your victory
[1:07:06] Bertram's said it this way he said don't
[1:07:08] accept accepted or accept God's gift he
[1:07:12] said don't have a negative testimony
[1:07:14] don't never let your testimony be
[1:07:16] negative it turns the whole body you see
[1:07:22] you can't deal with life's challenges
[1:07:26] without being horrible you cannot face
[1:07:31] your problems without being verbose
[1:07:35] you cannot pull into a shell and say I'm

[1:07:47] until you sound off are you with me now
[1:07:52] there has to be sound
[1:07:54] you see silence is the absence of sound
[1:07:58] not a substitute of sound

[1:08:05] substitutes for sound this morning but
[1:08:08] while we were in the season of silence
[1:08:11] our enemies will spread out and Isis
[1:08:15] spread out spread out relic use insults
[1:08:20] fear and sicknesses you see Satan thinks
[1:08:24] he can kill our sound this morning but
[1:08:28] in essence all he's doing is helping to
[1:08:32] create some sound in our lives
