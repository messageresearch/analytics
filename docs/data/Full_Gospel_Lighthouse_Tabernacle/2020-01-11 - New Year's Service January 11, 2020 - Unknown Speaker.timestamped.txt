[2:02] at this moment I'm gonna go to my
[2:06] scriptures and then continue one from
[2:08] there what a wonderful time in the Lord
[2:13] we've already had this evening we can
[2:17] say that we've truly have Church already
[2:21] but now we're getting to the good part
[2:24] over this over the past year and 2019
[2:28] we've seen many things happened at this
[2:31] church now I'm not talking about the
[2:35] other churches and message what I'm
[2:37] talking about this church at this church
[2:40] I can see revival has set in but we
[2:44] don't want that - revival - stay right
[2:46] here where we're at in 2019 but we
[2:50] wanted to rollover into 2020 and we
[2:53] wanted to continue to build and build
[2:55] and build amen we've had people - to
[3:02] sing that has never seen before
[3:04] we have people that's that stood up and
[3:06] clapped their hands that has never stood
[3:08] up and clapped their hands before you
[3:11] know when I when we was little growing
[3:12] up in the church hey you know there was
[3:14] nothing to have a shouting service but
[3:16] to stand up and clout and clap and shout
[3:19] the reading of the words you know it's
[3:21] just it's just great does my heart great
[3:23] joy and I remember my son Titus and as
[3:27] he was one of the the first ones that I
[3:29] did not teach him to do this at home
[3:32] period so don't think that I told Titus
[3:35] as Titus utin you need to stand up in
[3:37] church and he'd clap your hands you need
[3:39] praise Lord none that is
[3:40] the way he got that from examples and
[3:44] these these examples have set examples
[3:47] throughout the years and it's beginning
[3:48] to overflow out from the teacups onto
[3:52] the saucers and we're beginning to sip
[3:54] from the saucers amen
[3:57] so tonight I want to read from Isaiah
[3:59] 60:1 and then I want to be going over to
[4:02] Luke 4 so we're gonna be reading Isaiah
[4:05] 61 and verse 1 just say hey man when you
[4:09] have it tonight we know Isaiah is one of
[4:17] the greater prophets that wrote had many
[4:21] writings in the Bible and proclaims of
[4:25] the the Christ Jesus as his his Advent
[4:28] would come in Isaiah 61 it says in the
[4:32] Spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[4:34] because he hath anointed me to preach
[4:36] good tidings unto the meek he has sent
[4:40] me to bind up the brokenhearted to
[4:42] proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[4:45] opening of the prison to them that are
[4:49] bound to proclaim the acceptable year of
[4:51] the Lord and the day of vengeance of our
[4:54] God to comfort all that mourn to appoint
[4:57] unto them that mourn in Zion to give
[5:00] unto them beauty for Ashes the oil of
[5:03] joy for the mourning the garment of
[5:07] praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[5:09] they might be called trees of
[5:12] righteousness the planting of the Lord
[5:15] that he might be glorified that is why
[5:18] we're here tonight we're here to give
[5:20] God the glory in every single way this
[5:23] is not to give man praise at all this is
[5:26] only for God amen in order to read in
[5:29] Luke 4 and this is where Jesus has has
[5:33] been up on the mountain of temptation
[5:34] and the devil has tempted him here and
[5:37] he's coming down off the mountain into
[5:39] Galilee and he came into Nazareth
[5:44] verse 16 for 16 says and it came and he
[5:48] came into Nazareth where he had been
[5:50] brought up
[5:53] and his custom was he went into the
[5:58] synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to
[6:01] read and there was delivered unto Him
[6:05] the book of the prophet Isaiah
[6:08] and when he had opened the book he found
[6:10] the place where it was written the
[6:13] Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he
[6:17] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[6:20] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[6:23] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[6:25] the captives I want you to put your name
[6:29] in each of these places where he is
[6:32] preaching to you this is all for you
[6:37] the Spirit of the Lord is upon me
[6:39] because he hath anointed me to preach
[6:42] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[6:45] to heal the brokenhearted to preach
[6:48] deliverance unto the captives and Toorak
[6:51] and recovering of sight to the blind and
[6:56] set at liberty them that are bruised and
[6:59] to preach the acceptable year of the
[7:01] Lord now this is what I like here and he
[7:06] closed the book and he gave it again to
[7:09] the minister and he set down and the
[7:13] eyes of all them that were in the
[7:15] synagogue were fastened on him can you
[7:19] just imagine what he is read that Isaiah
[7:22] had written years and years ago
[7:25] [Applause]
[7:27] brokenhearted to preach deliverance
[7:32] there's been many many priests that's
[7:35] been in the synagogue's and here's Jesus
[7:38] setting and he then says this day this
[7:45] day
[7:46] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[7:50] they have waited for this moment all
[7:53] these years and then they receive it and
[7:56] he says this day proclaim that this day
[8:01] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[8:03] if you haven't heard it you're hearing
[8:06] it now he has come to heal the
[8:08] brokenhearted
[8:09] see I was captive I was bound how many
[8:13] of you have been captive you have been
[8:15] bound by the wages of sin that you held
[8:18] that was against you but he has come see
[8:23] I had felt the spirit of heaviness the
[8:26] spirit of laodicea that creeps in and
[8:29] just feels like there's a gravitational
[8:30] pull that continues just try to hold you
[8:33] back but he has come to loose that to
[8:38] give you praise garments of praise so we
[8:43] can stand up in this church and we can
[8:45] thank God for everything that he has
[8:46] given us we can sing praises unto the
[8:49] Lord
[8:49] we can clap our hands and guru you devil

[9:22] past year drive down those states drive
[9:26] them down let that spirit of heaviness
[9:29] be lifted amen

[10:58] [Applause]
[11:01] brother Branham says it here in the mark
[11:03] of the beast it says notice every slave
[11:05] when he heard that trumpet sound I think
[11:08] how great that is today sister Heather
[11:10] was feeling led upon her heart to sing
[11:13] that song ain't no grief got two dads
[11:16] and he said hey have them sing a song
[11:19] ain't no grave tonight and I knew what I
[11:21] was speaking of so okay well that can't
[11:23] be done and when he he heard that
[11:28] trumpet sound he could throw down his
[11:31] hole or whatever he was working with and
[11:33] say I am a free man
[11:36] I couldn't redeem myself but God through
[11:39] His grace has declared the year of
[11:41] Jubilee
[11:42] therefore I believed God and I don't
[11:45] have to work anymore the laws of the
[11:47] land claimed him free
[11:49] what a beautiful type of today we were
[11:51] bound but now we're free we poor aliens
[11:55] to do nothing we could keep every
[11:58] Sabbath every new moon quit eating meat
[12:01] we could keep all kinds of days and done
[12:03] all kinds of things of religious
[12:05] sacrifices that and we are under a load
[12:07] we are sold and sin our parents or
[12:10] descends sin in the Garden of Eden we
[12:14] are laden under the bonds of sin and
[12:17] slave to the devil we are born in sin
[12:20] shapen iniquity coming to the world
[12:23] speaking lies there is nothing we could
[12:25] do to help ourselves cause our whole
[12:27] makeup our whole nature and everything
[12:30] we are is sin amen but when the Jubilee
[12:37] time come when we are free that trumpet
[12:42] of the gospel is the good news the
[12:45] gospel is the good news the trumpet was
[12:48] the gospel then the good news you're no
[12:51] longer bound you're no longer a slave
[12:55] you're free
[12:57] amen have you heard that call have you

[13:33] bride underneath the ground because when
[13:35] that trumpet sounds we're all coming out
[13:37] of that ground amen
[13:39] [Applause]
[13:43] Amen it's something that's drawing us
[13:46] something that's on the inside of us
[13:47] that's saying go forth keep pressing on
[13:51] many have fallen away don't look at any
[13:53] of that's falling away you keep pressing
[13:55] on you keep your eyes on the prize amen
[13:59] what is it it's it was Christ's passion
[14:02] for you
[14:03] Christ's passion for me the crucifixion
[14:07] a man as brother Branham says it here in
[14:10] the manifestation of the resurrection
[14:12] and he says and I can see that profit
[14:16] that prince of prophets the king of
[14:19] prophets the Lord Jesus Christ as he
[14:22] came out of the gate moving along his
[14:25] space set towards Calvary the burdens of
[14:28] the world laid upon his blessed
[14:30] shoulders the Bible says there is no
[14:32] beauty that we should desire him perhaps
[14:36] a frail little fella as he walked out of
[14:39] that gate his head threw back his eyes
[14:43] towards heaven as he'd marched towards
[14:47] the will of God people make in front of
[14:50] him we only just have a shadow of it
[14:53] today but what was he looking at as he
[14:57] marched toward Calvary at you
[15:01] at me I can just see it now brother
[15:06] branham had that that vision that he
[15:09] could just see it like a TV picture we
[15:12] have The Passion of Christ the movie
[15:14] today and as they've beaten him beyond
[15:16] recognition
[15:18] inside of those gates there and men that
[15:22] were ordained of God to be there to rip
[15:26] flesh from his body and he's carrying
[15:30] that cross as he walks through those
[15:32] gates in his head set towards Calvary
[15:35] that's my king he was thinking of me I
[15:41] had that promise that he had me on his
[15:45] mind Philippians 3 and 13 says brethren
[15:51] I can't lock myself apprehend it but
[15:55] this one thing I do forgetting those
[15:58] things which are behind and reaching
[16:01] forth to those things which are before
[16:05] as I've said it before I press towards
[16:09] the mark for the prize of the high
[16:12] calling of God in Christ Jesus that's my
[16:14] promise that's each and every one of our
[16:17] promises in John 14:1 it says let not
[16:22] your heart be troubled that's the
[16:27] promise you've meant it quoted many
[16:30] times at funerals when there's been men
[16:33] umbers laying right here but this is to
[16:36] each and every one of us that has that
[16:38] promise let not your heart be troubled

[17:02] go and prepare a place for you I will
[17:05] come again and receive you unto myself
[17:09] that where I am there you may be also
[17:13] oh how beautiful that is tonight that we
[17:19] have that promise that where he is we're
[17:22] gonna be there his head set towards
[17:26] Calvary me when his mine you on his mind
[17:30] he knew each and every one of us would
[17:32] be here at the foundation of the world
[17:34] setting right where we are tonight and

[17:42] demon that would come against us and

[20:31] bless each and every one of you
[20:32] appreciate that brother matthew
[20:34] wonderful word of the lord amen
[20:36] while you're standing if you'll just
[20:38] turn with me to numbers chapter six
[20:40] we'll read briefly and let you be seated
[20:44] the help of the Lord like to speak to
[20:46] you for a few moments on your Nazarite
[20:49] vow numbers chapter 6 verse 1 and the
[20:55] Lord spake unto Moses saying speak unto
[20:58] the children of Israel and saying to
[21:00] them when either man or woman shall
[21:03] separate themselves to vow a vow of a
[21:06] Nazarite to separate themselves into the
[21:09] Lord he shall separate himself from wine
[21:11] and strong drink and shall drink no
[21:13] vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong
[21:16] drink neither shall he drink any liquor
[21:18] of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried
[21:22] all the days of his separation shall he
[21:25] nothing that is made of the tree bond
[21:26] from the kernels even to the husk all
[21:29] the days of the vow of his separation
[21:31] there shall no razor come upon his head
[21:34] until the days be fulfilled in the which
[21:38] he separated himself into the Lord he
[21:41] shall be holy and shall let the locks of
[21:43] his hair of his head grow all the days
[21:48] that he separated himself unto the Lord
[21:50] he shall come at no dead body he shall
[21:54] not make himself unclean for his father
[21:55] or for his mother
[21:57] or for his brother or for his sister
[21:59] when they die because the consecration
[22:02] of his God is upon his head all the days
[22:06] of his separation is holy unto the Lord
[22:09] Amen god bless yous you're seated a
[22:13] Nazarite as we just read is someone that
[22:17] is separated a very special group of
[22:21] people a very select special person that
[22:24] is separated only unto the Lord it does
[22:26] not matter
[22:27] what anyone else in the Old Testament
[22:29] whenever someone had set themselves to
[22:31] be a Nazarite unto the Lord they were to
[22:33] let their hair grow which is why our
[22:36] sisters don't cut their hair a man it is
[22:37] to express of a Nazarite vow within now
[22:41] that was in the natural but now the
[22:44] bride of Jesus Christ our spiritual
[22:45] Nazarites and when there's outward
[22:48] expressions of an inward work now Jesus
[22:51] was a Nazarite from his very birth in
[22:55] John 17 19 he says and for thy are their
[22:58] sakes I sanctify myself that they also
[23:01] may be sanctified through the truth the
[23:05] Prophet teaches us that God's Word calls
[23:07] for a total separation from unbelief not
[23:11] partially not just the part that you
[23:13] like but a total separation from
[23:16] unbelief and that makes you a Nazarite
[23:19] unto the Lord remember the story of the
[23:22] Prophet tales whenever that great
[23:23] musician plays and at the end everyone
[23:26] is clapping and thinks he did such a
[23:27] good job he was only looking up in the
[23:30] balcony to see if his master approved
[23:32] and that's all we're to do we're not to
[23:34] look at one another and get approval by
[23:36] flesh and blood but were to look to God
[23:38] because we are a Nazarite unto the Lord
[23:41] we are we are set aside and called for a
[23:44] purpose now I want to deal with a few
[23:48] moments with Samson because we know that
[23:51] Samson had a supernatural birth his
[23:54] parents his mother was barren and she
[23:56] was visited by an angel from the Lord
[23:57] and said that you were going to have a
[23:59] son because there was during the day of
[24:00] the judges and they were under the
[24:02] burden of the Philistines and they were
[24:05] they were under their thumb and they
[24:07] would come and they take their crops and
[24:08] things and in the book of Judges is
[24:09] where you find that that verse there
[24:11] about Shamgar he was under the thumb of
[24:13] the Philistines
[24:14] so God raised Samson up to destroy the
[24:19] Philistines and he was a Nazarite from
[24:22] his birth a person filled with the Holy
[24:25] Ghost is the Nazarite from your
[24:27] born-again Holy Ghost birth that
[24:29] separates you from the things of the
[24:31] world and that sets you aside for God's
[24:34] service then that makes you a Nazarite
[24:36] unto the Lord
[24:38] now Samson's
[24:40] channel Sampson's secret to his great
[24:43] strength was in his hair he had them
[24:46] seven locks of hair that were never to
[24:49] be touched no matter what happened no
[24:51] matter how much his friends might have
[24:52] made fun of his long hair no matter what
[24:54] he might have thought when he looked in
[24:55] the mirror that was his direct
[24:57] connection to God was his hair that is
[25:01] what made him a Nazarite and as long as
[25:04] as he had them seven locks god almighty
[25:07] was obligated to Samson
[25:10] because that was his promise to Samson
[25:12] and the Spirit of the Lord would come
[25:15] and he would channel him so that was
[25:17] God's covenant to Samson no matter what
[25:20] came across Samson's path no matter what
[25:23] Samson faced he could feel them seven
[25:26] locks that was a promise that he had
[25:32] from God despite the circumstances
[25:34] despite how many Philistines came
[25:36] against him he could reach back there
[25:38] and feel them seven locks no matter what
[25:43] comes against you saints of God no
[25:45] matter what you face in life you can
[25:46] reach back there and you can feel the
[25:48] Holy Ghost you can feel that token that
[25:51] he promised he'd never leave you or
[25:52] forsake you that was his secret to his
[25:56] strength that was his defense and he
[26:00] know he was charged to never give up
[26:02] that secret he was charged with when he
[26:05] was charged he had a charge from God to
[26:08] never divulge that secret to absolutely
[26:12] anyone to no stranger so we find that
[26:16] that our covenant that our seven locks
[26:19] is the type of the Holy Ghost is a type
[26:21] of this word this message that we have
[26:23] and we are not to budge from one single
[26:26] bit we're not to divulge from one single
[26:29] bit we're not to to let the enemy get in
[26:31] because I can promise you something
[26:33] where the weak spot in the word is in a
[26:37] person's life is where Satan gets access
[26:39] in a person's life in a church in a
[26:43] marriage and a family in a nation in a
[26:45] church age where they let down the bar
[26:47] that's where Satan gets in
[26:50] so God was obligated to this covenant as
[26:53] long as the seven locks of his hair
[26:56] remained uncut because whenever that
[26:58] lion rose up he was in the line of duty
[27:00] he was walking he was going down and
[27:03] their lions sprung up and it was no
[27:06] kitten and the Spirit of God came upon
[27:08] him in the Bible said that he tore him
[27:10] like a kid like a good like a baby go he
[27:12] just ripped him apart because he had
[27:14] been seven locks remember bro Ram said
[27:19] he wasn't some big bodybuilder he was a
[27:21] short man he was a small man in stature
[27:24] and he was your average man but yet the
[27:26] anointing of God was strike him and he
[27:28] would have supernatural strength because
[27:30] he was anointed with the Covenant so one
[27:35] day the enemy he was raised up to
[27:38] destroy caught him isolated one day
[27:41] caught him with no defence he was out by
[27:44] himself one day and an army of
[27:45] Philistines came up against him and all
[27:47] he had was a jawbone of a mule a fragile
[27:50] an old crusty jawbone of a mule of a
[27:54] donkey laying there but yet he could
[27:56] feel them locks he could reach back
[27:59] there and fill them Locke soon when he
[28:00] felt them locks he grabbed that in the
[28:02] spirit of God came on him and he killed
[28:04] a thousand Philistines by himself a
[28:08] thousand Philistines what is Psalm 91
[28:11] say though a thousand or ten thousand
[28:13] rise up against me they won't come near
[28:15] me because you're anointed with the
[28:17] Covenant because you're a Nazarite unto
[28:19] the Lord you've got that seven you've
[28:22] got that seven steel covenant you've got
[28:24] that full word you've got the Holy Ghost
[28:26] and God is obligated to you you know the
[28:32] prophet of God says in the church age
[28:33] book that you give God a reason for
[28:36] being to take care of you the purpose of
[28:42] the husband it gives him a purpose in
[28:43] life to take care of his family brother
[28:47] Brennan said Samson never walked up
[28:49] first and said here I'll tell you apart
[28:50] but the Spirit of the Lord come upon him
[28:52] that's what it did he felt back there
[28:55] and felt them seven locks hanging down
[28:56] that was the Covenant and he wasn't
[28:58] scared of a lion in the face of death he
[29:01] wasn't scared of it
[29:02] if Samson could
[29:03] feel seven lakhs and no it was a
[29:05] covenant because he was born and azurite
[29:08] how much more out a man that's born of
[29:10] the Holy Spirit feel the power of God
[29:12] and know what's the Covenant just slay
[29:15] the enemy before you whether it's
[29:17] sickness whether it's temptation
[29:18] whatever it is you can't stand it when
[29:21] the Spirit of God comes god is obligated
[29:27] to you when enemy comes in like a flood
[29:31] the Spirit of God will raise up a
[29:33] standard against it now
[29:36] Samson he was a servant of the Lord but
[29:41] you know he surrendered his strength to
[29:43] God but Samson had a weakness he had a
[29:48] weakness of women and Satan knew that
[29:50] and he would not surrender his heart and
[29:53] you see that's exactly where Satan
[29:54] punched him that's exactly where Satan
[29:56] got in so the secret Samson secret was
[30:01] the word that was this secret to his
[30:03] power to his victories when he could
[30:05] when they cornered him in and he went
[30:06] and got the actual gates of the city and
[30:08] went up went up hill with a whole gates
[30:11] of the city on him I guarantee he wasn't
[30:14] struggling he wasn't huffing and puffing
[30:15] he carried it like you'd carry an empty
[30:18] box now in the judges 16 if you make
[30:24] your way over there this evening I would
[30:27] like to type Samson with the individual
[30:32] and Delilah being a type of lady hacia
[30:37] the world and judges 16 15 and she saith
[30:43] unto Him how canst thou say I love thee
[30:47] when that heart is not with me thou hast
[30:49] mocked me these three times and it's not
[30:51] told me where in that great strength
[30:53] lieth and it came to pass when she
[30:55] pressed him daily with her words and
[30:57] urged him so that his soul was vexed
[30:59] unto death that he told her all his
[31:02] heart and said to and said unto her
[31:05] there hath not a razor come upon my head
[31:07] for I have been a Nazarite unto God from
[31:10] my mother's womb if I be shaven then my
[31:12] strength will go from me and if I become
[31:15] weak and be like any other man
[31:17] and I shall become weak and be like any
[31:19] other man and when Delilah saw that he
[31:21] had told her all his heart
[31:22] she sent and called for the Lords of the
[31:24] Philistines saying come up this once
[31:26] free it showed me all his heart then the
[31:28] Lords of the Philistines came up unto
[31:30] her and brought money in their hand and
[31:34] she made him sleep upon her knees and
[31:38] she called for a man and she caused him
[31:41] to shave off the seven locks of his head
[31:43] and she began to afflict him and his
[31:46] strength went from him we have to watch
[31:51] this spirit of lady hacia now because it
[31:57] will gradually come in like Delilah just
[31:59] put Santa's head right on her lap and
[32:01] begin to hum to him his favorite song
[32:04] and begin to play with his hair and
[32:07] begin to put him to sleep in a gradual
[32:10] way and he had no idea he thought that
[32:12] he could rise up and just shake himself
[32:14] and Satan will try and tell you that you
[32:17] can go so far as sin you'll be able to
[32:19] shake yourself but you'll be able to get
[32:21] away with this that you'll be able to
[32:22] get away with that you can stop smoking
[32:23] at any time you can stop looking at the
[32:25] wrong websites at any time you've got
[32:26] this but you don't because that spirit
[32:30] of Lady hacia is they say like boiling a
[32:34] frog can never boil the frog but they
[32:36] say you turn it up ever so gradually and
[32:38] that frog has no idea what's happening
[32:40] and that's what Satan likes to do he
[32:42] likes it too to isolate somebody and
[32:45] just slowly slowly that spirit of ladies
[32:49] here comes and if you don't rise up and
[32:53] shake yourself you're gonna find
[32:55] yourself asleep on Delilah's nice
[32:58] brother Brennan said notice now what
[33:00] Delilah did to Samson when she kept
[33:03] wooing him oh you're a great man oh
[33:06] you're a powerful and that's what Satan
[33:08] will tell you oh you're such a Christian
[33:09] you can never fall you're such a
[33:11] Christian you can go to the bar you're
[33:13] such a Christian you don't have to turn
[33:15] your head because you had this that or
[33:17] the other he will try and woo you
[33:19] brother branham said a Holy Ghost he'll
[33:22] man will turn his head a Holy Ghost
[33:24] filled woman will turn her head a Holy
[33:25] Ghost filled person will the Holy Ghost
[33:27] gods your feet guides your mind
[33:30] your tongue gods your hand and so
[33:34] Delilah was wooing him trying to bring
[33:36] this down to a close oh you're a great
[33:38] man you are powerful but don't deceive
[33:40] me tell me where in you life your
[33:42] strength and she loved them and she made
[33:45] love to him until finally he gave in and
[33:48] what do they do the first thing she did
[33:51] she had his secret taken from him when
[33:55] you leave the word you've left God when
[33:58] Samson gave up his secret to Delilah he
[34:00] left God God was obligated to his
[34:02] covenant for as long as Sampson stayed
[34:05] in but he divulged his secret now let's
[34:08] look at verse 20 and she said the
[34:12] Philistines be upon thee Samson and he
[34:16] awoke out of his sleep and said I will
[34:18] go out as the other times before and
[34:20] shake myself and whit's not that this
[34:23] that the Lord had departed from him but
[34:28] the Philistines took him now watch what
[34:30] happened and put out his eyes he
[34:34] couldn't see no more
[34:35] so when Satan get someone isolated and
[34:38] gets them in a lady of seeing condition
[34:40] because we're surrounded by lady or SIA
[34:43] but we're not in a later scene condition
[34:45] if apéritif you're in a later scene
[34:47] condition you need God because the
[34:51] latest scene condition is lukewarm blind
[34:53] naked miserable and don't know it sir
[34:55] Samson was in a Lagos in condition he
[34:58] had his eyes put out what was Jesus
[35:00] saying come to me and get outside that
[35:02] you can see and we see that brother Ram
[35:07] type Samson with the Pentecostals they
[35:11] were they came out and every single
[35:13] every single group do you do you
[35:14] understand that the Lutheran's were
[35:16] really the message believer of their day
[35:19] though people that came out under John
[35:21] Wesley were message believers but they
[35:23] be denominated whenever the Lutheran's
[35:26] whenever they denominated when God moved
[35:28] with Wesley they refused to move and
[35:30] that killed him right there and so as
[35:33] the ages unfolded the Pentecost was the
[35:35] the was those the light of the day God
[35:37] was restoring the gift he was preparing
[35:39] to sent a prophet when the Prophet came
[35:41] they
[35:42] fused and they denominated remember
[35:45] brother Han said that was a secret thing
[35:47] that was wrong and all the church ages
[35:50] and they got their eyes put out and they
[35:53] became a spectacle for the world now
[35:55] they're powerless they're powerless but
[36:01] let's read judges 16 22 howbeit the hair
[36:06] of his head began to grow again
[36:09] after he was shaven there was hope in
[36:12] Samson's restoration that wasn't the end
[36:15] brother Brennan said but there is a new
[36:17] generation coming on now Samson's hair
[36:21] has grown out so even though the
[36:23] Pentecostals compromise on the word and
[36:26] denominated and got their Hitler locks
[36:28] shaven the Samson's hair is regrowing
[36:30] and that is the bride of Jesus Christ
[36:33] we're in a restored way and when God
[36:38] seen his promise he's seen him since
[36:40] Samson's hair growed again that was
[36:42] God's promise to Samson that's right and
[36:44] when God seen Samson with his promise
[36:46] God was obligated to Samson to put his
[36:50] arms around them big old pillars like
[36:52] that and pulled her right in his
[36:54] strength had come to him again what was
[36:58] his cry just once more Lord and if
[37:03] you're a Samson in this church tonight
[37:04] cry out Lord just once more if he failed
[37:08] if you're sick Lord you've healed me
[37:11] wants just once more just once more Lord
[37:15] because you know whenever Samson finally
[37:19] surrendered his heart he killed more
[37:23] Philistines in that moment than he did
[37:26] his entire life when he finally got so
[37:29] surrendered and so broken he said Lord
[37:31] let me die with the enemy I don't care
[37:35] what it takes if I've got to die with
[37:37] the enemy let me die but just once more
[37:39] hear my prayer I failed you I'm being
[37:43] led by a child
[37:44] I have no eyes they're making fun of me
[37:46] they say my God's not real but just once
[37:50] more
[37:53] this endtime bride I believe with all my
[37:56] heart is getting more done than the
[37:58] other he just put together God's
[38:00] technology as they can stream their
[38:03] services and they can just send a quote
[38:05] through text and they can translate
[38:06] sermons and they can listen to the
[38:08] Prophet online and do all these things
[38:09] and other people of other ages have to
[38:13] walk and walk and walk in him deliver
[38:15] paul's letter and he can just send it
[38:17] send it send it will close with this
[38:23] brother Graham says to come Lord Jesus
[38:26] catch or catch away your church and if
[38:29] it be your will Lord just before that
[38:31] church is raptured may their rise power
[38:34] O God fill these vessels raise them up
[38:39] Lord shake this world once more we know
[38:43] it will be past time there will be no
[38:46] more repentance then it'll be too far
[38:48] for them then but show your power Lord
[38:51] fill those vessels and shake this world
[38:55] like it's never been shipped before take
[38:59] your church then and God promised a
[39:03] powerful shaking right before this
[39:04] little bride is taken off the earth just
[39:07] once more Lord just once more it doesn't
[39:13] matter how much you failed it doesn't
[39:15] matter where you are there's hope in
[39:18] restoration remember Samson killed more
[39:22] of the enemy God raised Samson to kill
[39:24] the Philistines and that and then
[39:25] Philistines were making fun of him and
[39:27] the enemy got victory over God's servant
[39:31] because of his humanity he failed like
[39:34] the rest of them but yet in his
[39:37] restoration he killed more of the enemy
[39:42] because he finally surrendered his heart
[39:45] to God double issue this evening

[43:32] man if you have your Bibles again we'll
[43:34] turn over to the scriptures into the
[43:39] book Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 16 and
[43:45] verse 17 and then down to mark chapter
[43:49] 11 and verse 20 I have already given you
[43:54] my theme this past weekend for the new
[43:58] year that God is with us and we will see
[44:03] miracles this is the year for miracles
[44:08] and we're gonna walk into those things
[44:13] and I just I just know these things are
[44:18] very pertinent to us but this this this
[44:24] the scripture that we read here in
[44:26] Isaiah chapter 53 54 verse 16 and 17 is
[44:33] is our pastors favorite Scripture you
[44:37] can probably hear it in every every
[44:39] sermon that he's ever preached behold I
[44:43] have created the Smith that bloweth the
[44:46] coals and the fire and that bringeth
[44:49] forth an instrument for his work and I
[44:52] have created the waste or to destroy no
[44:57] weapon
[45:00] no weapon that is formed against the
[45:07] shall prosper every tongue that shall
[45:10] rise against the in judgment thou shall
[45:14] condemn Church I'm speaking to you
[45:18] thou shalt condemn this is the heritage
[45:25] of the servants of the Lord and their
[45:28] righteousness is of me saith the Lord
[45:32] mark chapter 11 and verse 20 these
[45:39] things are very very familiar to us as
[45:43] believers of the message that these
[45:47] things were pondered over by the prophet
[45:49] of the Lord were these were these
[45:52] scriptures in the atonement and the
[45:56] atonement that Christ paid for us and
[45:58] they are and we have seen mighty
[46:02] miracles that have taken place by the
[46:05] reading of these scriptures today we are
[46:08] not fighting an enemy with just just a
[46:10] book today we are fighting an enemy with
[46:14] a living word a living God this is the
[46:19] literal word of God on printed pages and
[46:22] you have the ability to take this word
[46:25] and put it upon your lips speak it from
[46:27] your heart and watch the enemy crumble
[46:31] under your feet and the Bible says here
[46:35] in mark 11 and 20 and in the morning as
[46:37] they pass by they saw the fig tree dried
[46:40] up from the roots and Peter calling to
[46:43] remembrance say them to him master
[46:45] behold the fig tree which thou cursed it
[46:48] is withered away and Jesus answering
[46:51] saith unto them have faith in God for
[46:54] verily I say unto you that whosoever
[46:56] shall say under this mountain be thou
[47:00] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[47:02] and shall not doubt in his heart but
[47:05] shall believe that those things which he
[47:07] saith shall come to pass he
[47:10] have whatsoever he saith therefore I say
[47:14] unto you what things soever you desire
[47:16] when you pray believe that you receive
[47:19] them and you shall have them this if
[47:24] this is anybody scripture this is your
[47:26] scripture that what thing soever you
[47:29] desire when you pray believe that you
[47:32] receive them and ye shall have them god
[47:36] bless his word you may be seated this
[47:38] evening I'll just go ahead and tell you
[47:43] I'm gonna take more than 15 minutes I've
[47:49] got something to deliver to you this
[47:51] evening as a body as a church and the
[47:58] things I have to deliver I know this
[48:02] that God is with us
[48:03] and we will see miracles so blessed be
[48:06] the name of the Lord God is with us and
[48:11] we will see miracles as a church full
[48:14] gospel Lighthouse we have seen some of
[48:17] the most prolific miracles right here in
[48:20] our midst we have seen the dead raised
[48:24] we have seen life spoken to dead wounds
[48:28] we have seen visions come to fulfillment
[48:31] and little bitty blond-headed boys we
[48:37] will see miracles to this coming year we
[48:42] have seen car wrecks that looked like
[48:44] all hope was gone it looked like that
[48:47] there was no way that a man could
[48:49] survive a wreck like this but God made a
[48:52] way Church of the Living God we've seen
[48:56] miracles because that's what we are is
[48:59] the Church of the Living God we have
[49:02] seen sarcoidosis that was staring down
[49:05] the Queen of our church we watched it be
[49:09] destroyed by the power of prayer and
[49:11] whose prayers was it that destroyed that
[49:14] your prayers in a Living God because
[49:18] what things soever you desire when you
[49:20] pray believe that you shall receive them
[49:22] and you shall have them
[49:23] and it was your prayers in a living God
[49:26] that cursed the life of sarcoidosis and
[49:29] sarcoidosis is defeated it is defeated
[49:35] in the name of Jesus Christ it was your
[49:40] prayers that breed over a man by the
[49:42] name of Harold shifflett and Harold
[49:44] shifflett was completely delivered we
[49:47] have seen miracles we seen produções
[49:50] come back to this church when it looked
[49:52] like they would not come back brother
[49:54] Lawrence you came back in the name of
[49:56] the Lord Jesus Christ we have seen
[49:58] miracles if anybody is going to see
[50:02] miracles We the People of God are going
[50:04] to see miracles we believe these things
[50:11] my brother Steve Thomas's funeral as you
[50:15] all know maybe I will speak some things
[50:20] that I have not spoke before but because
[50:22] the enemies challenged I will speak
[50:24] these things brother Steve Thomas's
[50:28] funeral I I asked I asked that day for a
[50:32] very special visitation and that the
[50:36] angel the Lord would hold me up while I
[50:39] preached behind this pulpit at that time
[50:42] I was a young book as you would say but
[50:45] I had reached several funerals at that
[50:47] time and before this I had preached
[50:49] maybe maybe 10 15 funerals at that time
[50:53] just kind of being thrown right into the
[50:55] fire but brother Steve Thomas his
[50:59] passing it gripped every single one of
[51:02] our hearts and because I was so close
[51:06] with brother Jeffrey and brother Stephen
[51:08] the family I needed a supernatural God I
[51:12] needed a supernatural God to wrap his
[51:14] arms around me and to hold me up that
[51:18] day especially and I asked for that same
[51:22] supernatural God to visit that family
[51:25] and that's exactly what happened
[51:29] while I stood at this pulpit maybe how
[51:34] long has this been now brother Jeffrey
[51:36] four or five years now
[51:37] I stood at this pulpit and sister Margie

[56:24] complicated we're going way out there
[56:27] trying to get something way out there
[56:28] and here it is right here by us it's
[56:30] simple if you've got faith enough to
[56:33] walk across that floor you got faith
[56:35] enough for anything that God promised if
[56:38] you've got faith enough to rise up your
[56:41] hand raise up your hand you've got faith
[56:43] enough for anything else
[56:44] it's simple faith it's not something

[56:52] that without and shared something with
[56:56] me yesterday by the first lady the wife
[57:01] of Franklin Roosevelt Eleanor Roosevelt
[57:05] said you gain strength courage and
[57:08] confidence by every experience in which
[57:10] you really stopped to look fear in the
[57:13] face you are able to say to yourself I
[57:17] live through this horror I can take the
[57:20] next thing that comes along you gain
[57:23] strength courage and confidence by every
[57:26] experience

[57:29] in the face you are able to say to
[57:31] yourself I live through this horror I
[57:34] can take the next thing that comes along
[57:37] church we are believers and believing is
[57:41] what we do we have been through many
[57:45] battles together we're going to go
[57:47] through many battles more together so
[57:52] I'm going to ask you like a never-before
[57:55] to call on the Almighty God like never
[57:58] before
[57:59] I'm going to ask you to believe like
[58:02] never before
[58:03] I'm going to ask you to release your
[58:05] faith like never before and I'm going to
[58:08] ask you something that may standard you
[58:12] if there's anything in your life that
[58:15] would hold your prayer back from
[58:17] reaching God I want you to get it right
[58:21] the only thing that stands between you
[58:23] and God is unconfessed sin and if
[58:26] there's anything that's going to stand
[58:28] between you and your prayers to God I
[58:30] want you to confess those things to God
[58:32] get those things right and make it right
[58:35] and have a conversation with God and get
[58:39] into full contact with Almighty God
[58:41] brother Branham said that prayer is the
[58:43] greatest weapon that is given to mankind
[58:46] when you're praying you're not speaking
[58:48] to something weak God you're talking to
[58:50] a God that can change the course of
[58:52] humanity you're talking to a God that
[58:54] can set the world on in by the power of
[58:58] one word give those things right in your
[59:01] life and watch the prayer go to work as
[59:03] a guy who prayed one time and when the
[59:06] Prophet came in and give him a death
[59:08] warrant he prayed turned his face to the
[59:11] wall and weapon ask God for 15 more
[59:13] years he prayed and God turned back the
[59:17] clock of time and he gave him 15 more
[59:19] years
[59:22] Hezekiah knew how to pray Hezekiah
[59:26] prayed one time and there was no arraign
[59:29] for three and a half years Hezekiah
[59:31] prayed and hailstones came down and
[59:34] rained upon the Assyrian
[59:35] and killed a hundred and eighty-five
[59:37] thousand Syrians before that camp of
[59:40] Israel could get out of their bed prayer
[59:44] works
[59:45] I'm asking you as a church to believe in
[59:48] a Living God to do extreme things to
[59:53] believe that Bible days are here again
[59:55] to believe that the god of this bob was
[59:58] right here with us that the God that
[1:00:00] raised the dead that God that brought
[1:00:02] dead life to dead wounds that God that
[1:00:05] are healed cancer that God that did all
[1:00:07] of these events will do it again this is
[1:00:13] the part I want your attention I want
[1:00:16] you to hold your children still I don't
[1:00:19] want you to listen to me like you never
[1:00:21] listened to me before brother Ron had
[1:00:29] been having a few issues in his body and
[1:00:34] so they the day before Christmas Eve
[1:00:39] well Ron went to the doctor and the
[1:00:44] doctors looked over his body and they
[1:00:47] ordered a an emergency CT scan they

[1:01:22] or enlarged the doctors at this point do
[1:01:28] not know what they are we don't know
[1:01:30] what they are but we're not crossing
[1:01:33] bridges until they get to us
[1:01:36] so brother on will be seeing doctors
[1:01:39] this coming week to set a course of
[1:01:41] action in place I'm asking you to
[1:01:49] believe like never before we are serving
[1:01:54] a god that is the dissolver of doubts do

[1:02:16] want to tell you as a church that God is
[1:02:19] the God that's going to dissolve these
[1:02:21] tumors in brother ons lungs

[1:17:41] criticize but didn't understand why we
[1:17:43] as a family we didn't give we didn't
[1:17:47] give voice to the enemy they didn't
[1:17:50] understand we were sending out reports
[1:17:52] that brother on had a good night because
[1:17:56] I live every single day as if this day
[1:17:59] I've got another chance to live mother
[1:18:03] on had another chance to live while he
[1:18:05] was there on that ventilator and brother
[1:18:06] on had another good day they didn't
[1:18:09] understand what we were coming from
[1:18:10] because before dad went through the fire
[1:18:13] dad had taught us as Christians that we
[1:18:16] believe no matter what we see with our
[1:18:19] natural eyes we believe man they didn't
[1:18:24] understand that they didn't understand
[1:18:26] the circumstances that we were facing so
[1:18:28] they had to come and see for themselves
[1:18:29] and brother Ron was in he was in a
[1:18:32] precious state of life we didn't I
[1:18:35] didn't understand who I was I did not
[1:18:38] come to my awakening as a son of God but
[1:18:43] this is a different battle
[1:18:45] I know exactly who I am I know exactly
[1:18:50] what I've been called for and if I could
[1:18:53] believe from that point and from that
[1:18:56] perspective as a human being what about
[1:18:59] now
[1:19:00] church we are further up the road
[1:19:02] thirteen years now than what we were 13
[1:19:05] years ago we have seen miracle upon top
[1:19:08] of miracle this will be another
[1:19:13] testimony it's at the darkest hours that
[1:19:19] Jesus steps in this is not Gabriel
[1:19:22] that's coming this is not Warren Lord is
[1:19:23] coming this is God that's coming and
[1:19:26] Jesus has taken the case Jesus has taken
[1:19:31] the case you see Satan has limited power
[1:19:34] what he can do you see he can't get to
[1:19:37] that soul round he cannot get to that
[1:19:40] soul realm and you see he's got limited
[1:19:43] power and got limited access in you that
[1:19:45] working high positions you have you have
[1:19:48] passwords and you have codes to get into
[1:19:50] that position and there are certain
[1:19:53] people that below you that have they
[1:19:54] don't have access there that is a
[1:19:56] restricted area that they cannot go to
[1:19:58] and you see Satan has access to the
[1:20:02] flesh because that's where he is he is
[1:20:04] allowed to go but he cannot go to that
[1:20:07] soul realm but you see God has unlimited
[1:20:10] power God has the ability to catch Satan
[1:20:14] all the way out all the way from the
[1:20:16] soul from the spirit into the flesh he
[1:20:18] can kick the devil completely out
[1:20:20] God has unlimited power I want you to
[1:20:24] know tonight that we are defeated we are
[1:20:27] disputing with a defeated enemy and
[1:20:29] nothing has hindered God at one moment
[1:20:32] it is not hindered his plan not one
[1:20:35] thing not one iota is out of place the
[1:20:38] fall didn't hinder God lot didn't hinder
[1:20:41] God the idol God fell did not hinder God
[1:20:44] Judas and his plans did not hinder God
[1:20:47] skeptics did not hinder God sickness did
[1:20:50] not hinder God cancer has not hindered
[1:20:53] God sugar diabetes has not
[1:20:56] has not hindered god TB did not hinder
[1:20:58] God sin a hinder God unbelief ain't
[1:21:02] hinder God it may hinder you but it will
[1:21:05] not defeat God we as a family we are a
[1:21:11] family and Satan is messed with the
[1:21:14] wrong family
[1:21:25] we are the family of the Most High God
[1:21:27] the possessor of heaven and earth the
[1:21:30] miracle worker that's a part of family I
[1:21:33] am in the miracle worker the promise
[1:21:36] keeper the waymaker the champion of

[1:21:47] marvelous in battle he's got zero losses
[1:21:50] he can't lose that's my god and it's his
[1:21:53] family that the devil was messing with
[1:21:56] cancer can't stop him

[1:22:25] stop God there is power in the name of
[1:22:28] Jesus Christ to break every chain and
[1:22:31] it's going to take a stronger win than
[1:22:33] this to keep me from my promise
[1:22:38] Wow
[1:22:40] sites and you are defeated
[1:23:00] oh we're gonna win this battle we're not
[1:23:07] gonna win it by emotions we're not going
[1:23:10] my win it by working you up we're gonna
[1:23:12] win this battle by just exactly how
[1:23:15] Jesus won this battle by the word it is
[1:23:19] written it is written Isaiah 53 by his
[1:23:23] stripes I am healed the Bible said in
[1:23:28] Philippians 4 and 13 that I can do all
[1:23:30] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:23:33] me Paul understood his weakness and he
[1:23:36] understood the humanity part and he said
[1:23:40] in 2nd Corinthians 12 and 10 therefore I
[1:23:42] take pleasure in infirmities in
[1:23:44] reproaches in necessities in
[1:23:46] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[1:23:49] sake for when I am weak then am i strong
[1:23:53] and Paul being conscious of this human
[1:23:56] element Paul directed us to Ephesians 6
[1:24:00] and 10 finally my brethren be strong in
[1:24:02] the Lord and in the power of his might I
[1:24:06] want you to take these scriptures
[1:24:08] personally put on the whole armour of
[1:24:10] God that you may be able to stand
[1:24:12] against the wiles of the devil for we
[1:24:14] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:24:16] against principalities against rulers of
[1:24:19] the darkness of this world against
[1:24:20] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:24:22] wherefore take unto you the whole armour
[1:24:24] of God that ye may be able to withstand
[1:24:28] in the evil day and having done all
[1:24:30] stand Paul recognized that he was not
[1:24:33] all-powerful Paul recognized that he was
[1:24:36] Amon was not omniscient he recognized
[1:24:38] that he was not omnipotent but he
[1:24:41] recognized that the god that he was
[1:24:42] serving was and that he could do all
[1:24:45] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:24:47] heal God ain't changing he ain't moving
[1:24:49] he ain't backing up on his promise he is
[1:24:52] the all-powerful
[1:24:55] God is with us and we will see miracles
[1:24:58] I have preached to you the last 10 years
[1:25:03] and I have been a student I've been a
[1:25:07] student of this message I have stayed
[1:25:09] when everybody else was playing
[1:25:11] basketball when everybody else was out
[1:25:14] with their family enjoying dinners I
[1:25:16] stayed in this word I stayed in this
[1:25:20] message I've listened to messages after
[1:25:21] messages after messages I may not listen
[1:25:24] to every single one of the 1,100 to
[1:25:26] 1,200 sermons that there are but I can
[1:25:27] say that I've listened to some of them
[1:25:29] thousands of times I have been a student
[1:25:32] of this message for moments like this
[1:25:34] you have watched me battle time and time
[1:25:38] again from this pulpit there's a whole
[1:25:42] line of fighters in my family history I
[1:25:44] can point back to Abraham when he took
[1:25:47] 318 servants and he come back packing
[1:25:49] into victory I can point back to Elijah

[1:32:43] phenomenal I think that's the best
[1:32:45] Matthew's dead ever a man each and every
[1:32:50] one of you William that was absolutely
[1:32:53] wonderful
[1:32:55] I'll not take long but I'd like to read
[1:32:59] your scripture for Samuel chapter 17
[1:33:02] verse 41 we've got some precious friends
[1:33:07] they're tuning in for for this this
[1:33:10] evening and so I just want to share a
[1:33:12] few things with them and and we've
[1:33:17] gotten a lot of eyes that's watching and
[1:33:20] we'll be watching and the Philistine
[1:33:26] came one and drew near unto David and
[1:33:30] the man that bared the shield went
[1:33:32] before him and when the Philistine
[1:33:36] looked about and saw David he disdained
[1:33:38] him for he was but a youth ruddy and of
[1:33:44] a fair countenance and the Philistine
[1:33:48] said unto David am i a dog that thou
[1:33:51] camest to me with staves and the
[1:33:54] Philistine cursed David by his gods and
[1:33:58] the Philistine said to David come to me
[1:34:01] and I will give thy flesh to the fowls
[1:34:03] of the air and of the beasts of the
[1:34:06] field and then said David to the
[1:34:09] Philistine now came has done to me with
[1:34:12] a sword and with a spear and with a
[1:34:15] shield when I come to thee in the name
[1:34:18] of the Lord of hosts the god of armies
[1:34:21] of Israel whom Dallas defiled this day
[1:34:26] will I deliver thee into mine hand and I
[1:34:29] will smite thee and take on head from
[1:34:32] thee and I will give thee the carcasses
[1:34:34] of the host of the Philistines this day
[1:34:37] under the fowls of the air and to the
[1:34:40] wild beasts of the earth and all the
[1:34:43] earth may know that there is a God in
[1:34:45] Israel and all his Assembly shall know
[1:34:48] that the Lord saith not with sword and a
[1:34:53] spear for the battle is the Lord's and
[1:34:56] He will give you into our hands
[1:35:12] I've been sick before but I made it I've
[1:35:19] been broke before but I made it I've
[1:35:26] been brokenhearted before but I made it
[1:35:30] I cried all night long but I made it
[1:35:37] I've been lied on but I made it
[1:35:41] I've been destitute but I made it I've
[1:35:47] been rejected but I made it I've got
[1:35:59] around me some incredible friends you're
[1:36:01] known by the friends that you have so
[1:36:08] I'd like to mention a few generals while
[1:36:10] I'm in the field since Goliath has made
[1:36:17] a challenge I'd like to remind him I'm
[1:36:21] not alone you see when he steps out and
[1:36:26] he's making his boast and it's sometimes
[1:36:28] a pretty formidable boast there's a
[1:36:33] reason why God allowed him to be
[1:36:34] measured and to be his size because he's
[1:36:39] no paper tiger but I'd like to remind
[1:36:44] him since he's made his boast I'm not
[1:36:46] alone when I was laying in the hospital
[1:36:51] and they were I just came back to to
[1:36:56] life and the doctor came in one day and
[1:36:59] he sit down beside him and he pulled a
[1:37:01] little chair up and he sit down the side
[1:37:03] of me he said you know he said I'll work
[1:37:05] on patience all the time he said they're
[1:37:08] just patients and I care for them and
[1:37:10] take care of them he said but
[1:37:14] we know people by who comes and visits
[1:37:17] and he says you're a great man not
[1:37:25] because I think that way because God
[1:37:27] thinks that way and I'd like to remind
[1:37:31] him he's picked on somebody and I'm not
[1:37:36] your average bear and so he monied z--
[1:37:41] to know who he's picking on I'd like to
[1:37:46] thank the doctors that have been working
[1:37:48] on me so far I'd like to personally
[1:37:51] thank sister Dolores from this pulpit
[1:37:53] she is a warrior the news that I got was
[1:37:59] not pleasant it was quite difficult I'm
[1:38:03] a human being for the gathering of the
[1:38:06] news the other yesterday evening brother
[1:38:09] Nathaniel and sister Suzanne Cain and my
[1:38:13] family all gathered I knew something was
[1:38:15] happening when everybody was gathering
[1:38:18] yesterday evening and I knew I was about
[1:38:22] to get some difficult news did I weep
[1:38:32] yes I wept was I disappointed yes I was
[1:38:35] disappointed did it take my breath yes
[1:38:38] it took my breath but you just let me
[1:38:41] catch my breath for a moment
[1:38:50] you see the Lord has given me special
[1:38:52] insight and a lot of things in life and
[1:38:58] one of the first Inklings that I knew
[1:38:59] that I had a storm coming that one of my
[1:39:03] buddies brother Kelly Hildebrandt had a
[1:39:06] very difficult time coming to deliver a
[1:39:10] message and it may not have sent a
[1:39:15] signal to you but it sent a signal to me
[1:39:17] that there's a storm coming three days
[1:39:24] he was in airports trying to get here
[1:39:27] three days he he struggled and he prayed
[1:39:31] and his brother showed up on another
[1:39:35] aircraft with no trouble whatsoever not
[1:39:37] even a minute late but the man with the
[1:39:41] message fought with great agony to get
[1:39:47] here but he had a message I had prayed
[1:39:54] that week and and God had spoke to me a
[1:39:57] message and that message was don't worry
[1:40:02] and I preached that message with all my
[1:40:05] heart
[1:40:06] delivered it to you as an audience and
[1:40:09] I've got just incredible response from
[1:40:12] it from different places people being
[1:40:15] healed and I spoke to you on don't worry
[1:40:22] then God began to drop sermons in my
[1:40:25] heart that one would be courage I knew
[1:40:30] that I was to go to brother bisko's and
[1:40:32] brother Tom raised to speak and as
[1:40:36] brother Kelly comes and delivers his
[1:40:38] heart then brother Danny Steinmann comes
[1:40:41] and as he preaches and I'm sitting there
[1:40:47] and he's delivering the Word of God
[1:40:49] these men are generals
[1:40:52] I consider men like Kim pricked Donny
[1:40:54] Reagan Kelly Hildebrandt
[1:40:59] now I'm naming the generals in the field
[1:41:01] Joe green I consider these men Jason
[1:41:04] Jackson that's named after the warrior
[1:41:07] that came from this valley and I don't
[1:41:13] want to offend nobody but the multitude
[1:41:17] of men that I stand with I got to
[1:41:20] fellowship with by the mystical and
[1:41:22] brother Tom ray the other day and I
[1:41:25] thought of how what a blessing that God
[1:41:27] has allowed me to do when I went to dr.
[1:41:33] Buckwalter the other day and and I just
[1:41:36] we just had a very frank conversation
[1:41:39] and he's a real man he's a real
[1:41:40] Christian an examination went the way
[1:41:45] that it did he expedited the process and
[1:41:49] I'd like to thank you for all the
[1:41:52] emergency signals and things that have
[1:41:55] led us to this point
[1:41:57] we've got the news that we have but what
[1:42:01] would we do with the news I'd like to
[1:42:04] just remind and just recycle just for a
[1:42:06] moment he gave his sermons don't worry
[1:42:10] he gave us sermons to take it back he
[1:42:15] gave us a sermon to go wash naman and we
[1:42:27] are overcomers
[1:42:31] as I shared with you as Christmas would
[1:42:35] come and and you see I'm uh I'm uh I'm a
[1:42:39] little bit of a different sort of person
[1:42:40] there's certain things that I kind of
[1:42:43] take real sensitive to myself hey I I
[1:42:46] attach myself to certain things and and
[1:42:50] there's a man that's named Abraham a
[1:42:52] hunter that would paint a picture that
[1:42:54] would hang over my over my ax
[1:42:57] in the big room that brother Terry built
[1:42:59] and it's called Shalom which is peace
[1:43:03] the line with the lamb dedicated my home
[1:43:08] to that that's what my home is I I said
[1:43:10] this last week we have a table that
[1:43:13] seats I think 18 people 16 on the normal
[1:43:16] basis it can stretch to 18 and above and
[1:43:19] we had a Christmas party the other day
[1:43:21] and we'd stretch later as far I think we
[1:43:23] had about 40 there of her family that
[1:43:26] was there enjoy that I put on a bow tie
[1:43:29] and an apron and enjoyed the whole day
[1:43:32] but we've never had an argument there
[1:43:35] nobody's ever got up from the table and
[1:43:38] LAN out of the room because there was
[1:43:40] feuds and anybody can stand at that cent
[1:43:43] that tonight and say it's wrong but
[1:43:45] nobody's ever left my table man and
[1:43:48] upset Satan's not welcome in her house
[1:43:52] and I want to remind him these lungs
[1:43:56] were given to me twelve years ago by the
[1:43:59] creation of the Word of God
[1:44:02] so Satan has moved in into God's
[1:44:08] creation and I want to stand and you say
[1:44:12] well brother on should you have a pity
[1:44:13] party
[1:44:14] I want no pity
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:34] if this is the battle that I must fight
[1:44:38] then let us fight when I looked at the
[1:44:44] picture of Jesus coming through the
[1:44:46] storm and it has dropped into my hands
[1:44:49] I'm an individual that I went after that
[1:44:51] picture and I couldn't get it and I
[1:44:55] don't lose very often I'll stay after it
[1:45:00] some of you that's been in auctions you
[1:45:02] realize I when I go after a piece I go
[1:45:05] after a piece some of you've been in war
[1:45:10] know that it when I'm after I'm after it
[1:45:14] when I go to pray I believe in a God
[1:45:16] that here's an answers prayer but that
[1:45:20] does not make us immune because we live
[1:45:23] in a net and atom body and this atom
[1:45:26] body is cursed with a curse but listen
[1:45:32] new brother branham makes a statement he
[1:45:34] said death will come to your door and
[1:45:37] you can walk into it prematurely or and
[1:45:44] I choose the order tonight
[1:45:49] my God's bigger than this problem he's
[1:45:54] bigger than whatever they label it I
[1:45:59] will attend every appointment that the
[1:46:03] doctors have for me to attend some of
[1:46:06] the tests has already been a little bit
[1:46:08] rigorous for my body and God's given me
[1:46:12] deliverance even tonight to be able to
[1:46:14] stand here with you I have an
[1:46:19] appointment Monday morning with dr. buck
[1:46:23] Walker again and the team
[1:46:28] have an appointment with the specialist
[1:46:31] on Friday at UVA in the pulmonary clinic
[1:46:35] some of you that have tried to get Seth
[1:46:39] you've been trying to get appointments
[1:46:41] for a long time
[1:46:42] you could testify that it's a miracle
[1:46:44] that I get an appointment this quickly
[1:46:47] with the specialist in there'll be scans
[1:46:50] coming and a lot of different things
[1:46:51] that will happen but regardless of what
[1:46:54] you hear and regardless of what Galatz
[1:46:58] name is I want you to be with me now
[1:47:03] regardless of what the name of Goliath
[1:47:05] is we're going to win
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:38] I shared this last week with you or two
[1:47:42] weeks with you and then I shared it with
[1:47:43] brother Bissell's group be still and
[1:47:46] know that I am God I'm bigger than your
[1:47:50] problem I'm bigger than your
[1:47:52] circumstance I'm bigger than your
[1:47:55] situation this is not your battle you
[1:47:59] don't have to handle this this is God's
[1:48:01] battle God will work it out all you have
[1:48:05] to do is be still and know that I am God
[1:48:09] [Applause]
[1:48:14] pieces have been set around me and I'd
[1:48:18] like to thank God for the team that is
[1:48:19] sitting around us tonight
[1:48:21] the team of musicians that come to their
[1:48:24] place and play skillfully and they play
[1:48:27] with an atmosphere of a Holy Ghost
[1:48:30] atmosphere to prepare us to go to
[1:48:32] worship thank you for a group of people
[1:48:35] that comes in attentively and you're
[1:48:38] you're here and unless unseen foreseeing
[1:48:41] circumstances you come and you come
[1:48:43] ready almost every service is like a
[1:48:46] camp-meeting service here almost
[1:48:49] convention like atmosphere as preachers
[1:48:51] we know that's because you're a trained
[1:48:54] group you're ready you're ready for the
[1:48:57] Word of God and it's more than about
[1:49:00] coming for emotion
[1:49:02] though we love emotion we love we we
[1:49:05] love emotion we love to worship the Lord
[1:49:08] we love to feel his power come down but
[1:49:11] it's the Word of God that will defeat
[1:49:13] the devil anywhere any place any time
[1:49:18] under any convicted
[1:49:28] so brother animus says this he says if
[1:49:31] you're a Christian believer you're a son
[1:49:34] of God a daughter of God what are you
[1:49:38] scared about
[1:49:39] there's no need of being scared as long
[1:49:41] as the devil can keep you scared that's
[1:49:43] all he wants to do if he's if he does
[1:49:46] he's got you then spiritual amnesia it's
[1:49:50] not knowing who you are but know you and
[1:49:55] who you are produces faith Jesus had
[1:50:00] perfect faith because he knew who he was
[1:50:04] in the word perfect love cast out all
[1:50:10] fear and love and faith is the same
[1:50:13] thing you see love perfect love cast out
[1:50:20] all fear which gives faith so Goliath
[1:50:28] wants to march into our field we can
[1:50:31] already see that we've heard the sermon
[1:50:33] don't worry and I went with already one
[1:50:40] report telling me that I had a problem
[1:50:42] but I still went to Cloverdale and
[1:50:45] preached courage are you with me knowing
[1:50:51] that I had one tumor in my left lung
[1:50:53] that's all I knew at that tongue but I
[1:50:56] still stood there in the face of Goliath
[1:51:00] because the fella that I was preaching
[1:51:02] for had interviewed brother Charlie
[1:51:05] Mitchell at WWE
[1:51:08] DJ WDBJ say that 16 times fast that's
[1:51:17] pretty difficult and they had been
[1:51:20] having interviews for politicians
[1:51:22] because it was election season and it
[1:51:24] would take them hours to do a little
[1:51:26] second even a commercial and brother
[1:51:29] Charlie Mitchell and brother Ed Mystikal
[1:51:31] sat down and they interviewed them for
[1:51:33] 30 minutes and never had to take a break
[1:51:36] never
[1:51:37] had to stop them and the producer said
[1:51:39] what's the difference brother Bissell
[1:51:40] said we're telling the truth
[1:51:52] and I step to that pulpit in in
[1:51:55] Cloverdale and spoke courage and spoke
[1:51:58] it with all my heart
[1:52:00] and then on Sunday morning I walked back
[1:52:03] to that pulpit and that was the day that
[1:52:06] Cloverdale would get a bath I preached
[1:52:08] on name it and people live in double
[1:52:12] lives and I would say hundreds walk to
[1:52:15] that altar and while I preached I
[1:52:18] watched the pillar of fire go up and
[1:52:20] down over top of joel ray or he with me
[1:52:24] now and then that night i would preach
[1:52:27] take it back and god gave me more energy
[1:52:30] and more strength under the
[1:52:33] circumstances he's my god today
[1:52:38] [Applause]
[1:52:52] you see just as much as there was a
[1:52:55] picture that was given to me brother Tom
[1:53:00] Hill probably 99% of this congregation
[1:53:03] didn't know so brother Tom Hill walks in
[1:53:06] the back the back door I gotta take my
[1:53:10] coat off - really is this well and I'm
[1:53:15] done to be honest with you and he hands
[1:53:18] me a sling of all the Knights in the
[1:53:30] world for him to hand me a sling so I
[1:53:34] could have it God's telling me do you
[1:53:39] see what God's telling me
[1:54:14] now I've got confidence now let me just
[1:54:19] say God ain't done all this for a
[1:54:23] enemy he ain't done all this for a
[1:54:28] enemy so prepare you might as
[1:54:35] well prepare be honest about this face
[1:54:38] the facts he's a big intimate but we got
[1:54:45] a big eye
[1:55:00] and brother John God's taught telling me
[1:55:03] I got this I got this
[1:55:13] and brother Tim Pruett when he came here
[1:55:16] in September gave me five stones
[1:55:44] so on they disappear from your presence
[1:55:47] a little bit while I'm walking through
[1:55:48] the valley to pick up some rocks but
[1:55:54] when you see me again I'm gonna be
[1:55:56] swinging in there
[1:56:14] Oh
[1:56:16] [Applause]
[1:56:28] Shannon when he takes now that grave I
[1:56:31] walk to I don't know what it was like
[1:56:38] but I'm married millions of angels as
[1:56:41] that stone rolled away and he set up our
[1:56:49] Hollywood cake do it justice but when he
[1:56:52] set up I'll shop
[1:56:56] [Applause]

[1:57:15] gift for the time if you look in your
[1:57:22] life all your life and the devil's Ward
[1:57:27] in your mind I want you to tell the

[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:21] I walked a girl with cerebral palsy to
[1:58:25] the altar the other night walked her up
[1:58:27] and set up on the platform her name is
[1:58:29] Ella and the circumstances look
[1:58:33] incredibly difficult but she walked up
[1:58:37] there and she stood and I believe with
[1:58:44] all my heart she'll walk perfectly
[1:58:47] [Applause]
