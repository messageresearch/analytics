[42:27] very special way now God we have humbled

[43:26] uh I know many of of you didn't know
[43:27] exactly what was going on and I
[43:29] personally didn't know exactly what was
[43:30] going on either and went back forth to
[43:33] the doctor and and
[43:35] U they they basically just said
[43:37] something like like cold lius and it's
[43:39] basically like somebody had a knife in
[43:41] my in my side for about a week and a
[43:44] half now and and uh it's been been a
[43:47] battle and uh you know I I had I had
[43:52] doctors um guessing at what it was I had
[43:55] family members guessing at it what it
[43:56] was
[43:57] the difference was is one was a guest
[43:59] and one was an educated guest somebody
[44:02] paid more for their guest than this one
[44:04] but I I'm really thankful for the Lord
[44:07] touching my body I I can tell you it's
[44:10] you you you get sick like that or get
[44:12] pain like that you appreciate the good

[44:27] I I told the brothers uh there's a few

[44:32] tell you if I don't I said my people's
[44:34] going to call me a
[44:35] wimp seeing what my dad goes through
[44:38] every week and and uh so I didn't want
[44:41] to be called a wimp so but but I'm
[44:43] thankful to be feeling good and uh we're
[44:45] just going to test the waters out here
[44:47] this morning and uh just uh let the body
[44:50] Let the Body uh be healed by the
[44:52] anointing of the Lord and we certainly
[44:55] love each and every one of you and um I
[44:57] just want to make mention I got a I got
[44:59] a picture last weekend after we got out
[45:01] of service from brother Ron vest and his
[45:04] family the picture was his family and
[45:06] his entire family there and some other
[45:08] brothers and sisters there and his in
[45:09] his home there and they had took a
[45:12] picture of them worshiping while we were
[45:14] worshiping service while they were
[45:15] streaming and I it just really touched
[45:18] me that um how how how great the body of
[45:22] Christ is that she she's no matter what
[45:25] the mileage is no matter what the
[45:27] distance she's willing to feed on the
[45:30] unfailing body word of the son of man
[45:32] and uh we just certainly love the bride
[45:34] of Christ and and uh we just appreciate
[45:37] you so much amen if you have your Bibles
[45:40] today we'd like to look over in the
[45:42] scriptures in Psalms chapter 23 and just
[45:46] pick up a little bit
[45:48] of inspiration here that the Lord has
[45:51] has dealt with us
[45:52] on and uh
[45:57] you know maybe sometimes he sends you
[45:58] through something so that you can look
[46:00] at something in a in a way and uh I was
[46:05] just I I was going back through 1955
[46:07] this uh past two weeks and was listening
[46:10] through the message there and and
[46:12] brother random deals very heavily on
[46:15] some things there in in 1955 but he
[46:17] preaches a sermon on beginning and the
[46:19] ending of the Gentile dispensation and
[46:21] it's it's a beautiful text if you
[46:23] haven't listened to it for a while I I
[46:25] would encourage you to do so on I I'd
[46:27] like to draw our text from there today
[46:30] and also from Psalms 23 here David
[46:33] saying this the Lord is my shepherd and
[46:37] I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[46:39] down in Green Pastures he leadth me
[46:42] beside the Still Waters he restoreth my
[46:45] soul he leadth me in the paths of
[46:48] righteousness for his name's sake and
[46:51] yay though I walk through the valley of
[46:52] the shadow of death I will fear no
[46:55] evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[46:59] thy staff they comfort me thou preparest
[47:02] a table before me in the presence of my
[47:05] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[47:08] and my cup runneth over surely goodness
[47:11] and mercy shall follow me all the days
[47:13] of my life and I will dwell in the house
[47:16] of the Lord forever also Luke 4 and
[47:19] verse one
[47:30] then I'll also read one scripture from
[47:32] Revelations CH 3 and verse 20 just to
[47:36] draw our text today Luke 4 and verse1
[47:40] says and Jesus being full of the Holy
[47:42] Ghost returned from Jordan and was led
[47:45] by the spirit Into the Wilderness the
[47:48] key importance here Jesus being full of
[47:51] the Holy Ghost you remember exactly
[47:54] where we're just coming from in this Tex
[47:56] text is that he has just come out of the
[47:58] banks of the Jordan River and you begin
[48:01] to see the witness of the holy spirit
[48:04] that there Jesus is adopted that we see
[48:07] that the that the voice from Heaven says
[48:09] hear ye him and Jesus being full of the
[48:13] Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was
[48:15] led by the spirit in the wilderness
[48:17] being 40 days tempted of the devil and
[48:19] in those days he did not eat in nothing
[48:22] and when they were ended he afterward
[48:24] hungered and the devil said unto him if
[48:27] thou be the Son of God command this this
[48:29] stone that it be made bread and Jesus
[48:32] answered and saying it is written that
[48:35] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[48:37] every word of God also Revelations 3
[48:41] and: 20 behold I stand at the door and
[48:44] knock and if any man hear my voice and
[48:46] open the door I will come into him and
[48:50] will s with him and this is my favorite
[48:53] and he with me may God bless his word he
[48:56] may be seated SE in the presence of the
[48:57] Lord I would like to take a text today
[49:01] and title this on anointed in the
[49:04] presence of the enemy anointed in the
[49:07] presence of the enemy and I my subject
[49:09] matter will be uh quite heavily on a
[49:13] table prepared brother brandham makes
[49:16] this statement in the beginning in the
[49:17] enti G dispensation he said before you
[49:21] can have a victory there has got to be a
[49:23] battle and if there is no battles there
[49:25] is no victory iies so we ought to be
[49:28] thankful for the battles and the trying
[49:31] it's God giving us the opportunity to
[49:34] have victories we ought to be thankful
[49:37] for the battles and the trying it's God
[49:40] giving us the opportunity to have
[49:42] victories you know as soon as you start
[49:44] out for Christ no matter how old you are
[49:47] in your Christian walk but immediately
[49:49] you begin to think it's just it's just
[49:51] how a child thinks that you're you're
[49:53] not going to have to face opposition but
[49:55] it's absolutely the contrary you'll find
[49:58] that in this Christian Life it is one
[50:01] that is filled with constant attacks and
[50:03] disappointments and attacks from the
[50:05] enemy on this side and on that side you
[50:08] have battles within and you have battles
[50:10] without but I would say this no matter
[50:13] how many battles that you go through or
[50:15] I've been through I would choose this
[50:17] Christian walk a thousand times and
[50:20] doesn't matter what I've been through
[50:22] doesn't matter what I've seen or what
[50:23] what has gone by I would choose this
[50:25] life a th times because I realize what
[50:28] he saved me from now brother random
[50:31] would I would like to just draw this
[50:33] from here no wonder David said the Lord
[50:37] is my shepherd I shall not want and how
[50:40] he leads us by the side of still waters
[50:42] and restores their soul and runs our
[50:45] cups over and anoints us in the presence
[50:48] of the enemy he said did you ever get
[50:50] anointed in the presence of your enemy
[50:53] he said just to testify till your cup
[50:55] just bow over over you know just how
[50:58] marvelous it is to be anointed when in
[51:01] the presence of your enemy and I I would
[51:04] like to just ask the question have you
[51:05] ever been anointed in the presence of
[51:08] your enemy just to be able to testify
[51:11] that that you are you are in a place
[51:14] that your cup is running over that I
[51:16] think is very very beautiful that you
[51:18] can testify in the face of critics and
[51:20] you can testify in the face of your
[51:22] enemies even when you are in the midst
[51:24] of your trials that you can realize that
[51:26] you are anointed by by more than just a
[51:29] just by a a feeling but you are anointed
[51:32] by a power in the presence of your
[51:34] enemies now David would say in Psalms
[51:37] chapter 2 and verse one why do the
[51:39] Heathen rage and the people imagine a
[51:41] vain thing the kings of the earth set
[51:44] themselves and the rulers take counsel
[51:45] together against the Lord and against
[51:48] his anointed saying let us break their
[51:51] bands aunder and Cast Away their cords
[51:54] from us you notice that these these
[51:56] Kings and these these ones they have
[51:59] come together they are literally sitting
[52:00] down together and taking counsel against
[52:03] the Lord and against his anointing he
[52:06] said let us break their bands asunder
[52:08] and Cast Away their cords from us also
[52:11] in Psalms 20 and6 he said now I know
[52:14] that the Lord saveth his anointing that
[52:16] he will hear him from his holy heaven
[52:19] with the saving strength of his right
[52:21] hand so I I would like to just paint
[52:24] this picture to you today that the
[52:26] children of God are made to Triumph in
[52:29] the very presence of their enemies that
[52:31] the enemy has been called to this place
[52:35] to be able to watch you to watch you go
[52:38] through this but to watch God take care
[52:40] of you I want you to realize that the
[52:43] enemy that the reason why the enemy is
[52:46] is here is to watch you
[52:49] in I want you to realize that the reason
[52:52] why the enemy has even showed up is so
[52:54] that God can show that he's defending
[52:56] you
[52:57] I want you to realize that the reason
[52:59] why the enemy has even got a chance to
[53:01] be in the building today is so that God
[53:03] can show that he's willing to provide
[53:05] for you so just because you see the
[53:07] presence of enemies it does not mean
[53:09] that you are defeated it literally means
[53:11] that God is in
[53:14] control brother manam would take this
[53:16] text on on that day at Calvary he said
[53:19] he said now you can be honest just an
[53:21] upright he said but Satan can do nothing
[53:23] about it because you got a hold of a
[53:25] Lifeline he said it's anchored in the
[53:27] Rock of Ages he said nothing can shake
[53:28] you from it no winds can shake you from
[53:31] it no nothing not even death itself can
[53:33] separate us from the love of God that's
[53:35] in Christ Jesus he said that's what
[53:37] Calvary meant men that were in bondage
[53:41] were set free I would like somebody to
[53:43] say Satan was
[53:47] wrong say it to your neighbor Satan is
[53:50] wrong Satan is wrong and one of the
[53:53] greatest things about you is when you
[53:55] are going through your B battle and when
[53:57] you are going through your maybe your
[53:59] toughest of Trials if you can keep your
[54:01] focus and if you can keep your peace it
[54:04] is the most misunderstood proof of power
[54:07] that that is seen is when you are in the
[54:09] midst of it and in the midst of
[54:11] criticism or in the midst of a trial is
[54:13] that you can remain calm and collected
[54:16] and remain in peace and in focus and
[54:19] realizing that there's nothing that the
[54:21] enemy can do to you because the
[54:22] scripture said that no weapon that is
[54:24] formed against you shall Pro Prosper you
[54:27] see the enemy that has literally come
[54:29] against you was destined by almighty God
[54:32] so that God could set you down at the
[54:35] table it reminds me about that story
[54:38] brother Brandon will talk about that
[54:39] antelope that was trying to get away
[54:41] from the hounds how that he was running
[54:43] with everything he was panting with
[54:44] everything that was within him and the
[54:46] hounds were right on him but all of a
[54:48] sudden there was a fence that got out in
[54:49] front of the analou and the antalope
[54:51] jumped over top of the fence and the
[54:53] hounds couldn't do nothing to it because
[54:54] the electrical shock that was on that
[54:56] fence and that an brother random said
[54:58] that analou just turned around and
[55:00] snorted at him and took off with with
[55:02] peace in his life because he knew the
[55:04] hounds couldn't get past that fence well
[55:06] you and I are kind of like job this
[55:08] morning is that God's got a hedge about
[55:10] us that the devil can't do nothing to us
[55:14] because God has got a blood cell of
[55:15] Jesus Christ that was broke 2,000 years
[55:18] ago and the reason why the enemy has
[55:21] even showed up in this life in your life
[55:24] is so that you could be predestined or
[55:26] that that you could be crafted in such a
[55:28] space that'll show your
[55:32] predestination now brother brandom comes
[55:34] in in at the end of 1962 and you you
[55:38] realize as message studiers that you
[55:40] realize that brother bram's Ministry it
[55:43] has changed it is moving into the into
[55:46] the operation of the opening of the word
[55:48] and you're you're seeing the the third
[55:50] Po in manifestation and you begin to
[55:53] watch these things and if you go and
[55:54] look at the the last four service that
[55:56] brother brandham takes in in 1962 he
[55:59] preaches on the reproach for the cause
[56:01] of the word the absolute and is this a
[56:05] sign of the insurers and then he
[56:07] preaches a a the sermon at the at the
[56:09] end of the year or at the new year he
[56:11] preaches the contest and brother random
[56:14] you you'll see there that brother random
[56:16] starts he he's just now he's just now
[56:19] had the vision of of the Seven Angels
[56:21] coming to him and you here you go into
[56:23] is this a sign of the insur that Brother
[56:25] randam start coming there and he starts
[56:27] laying these things out and he starts he
[56:29] starts talking about all the hidden
[56:31] mysteries that that were to be revealed
[56:33] by the ministry of Malachi 4 and he
[56:35] starts looking at this and he realizes
[56:38] that he realizes that that that this in
[56:40] this Vision that if it's if it's his end
[56:43] if it's his end that that that it's just
[56:45] right around the corner but there the
[56:47] anointing of the Lord would sweep into
[56:49] the room and would tell him that it's
[56:51] not his end but it was literally the
[56:53] next phase of his ministry that was
[56:55] coming into view and brother brandom I I
[56:58] went through these I went through these
[56:59] tapes this past week on the reproach for
[57:01] the cause of Christ and brother brandom
[57:03] picks that up in Psalms 89 and verse 51
[57:07] he said wherewith thine enemies have
[57:09] reproached oh Lord wherewith have they
[57:11] reproached the footsteps of thine
[57:13] anointing blessed be the Lord forever
[57:15] more amen and amen and brother mam goes
[57:19] in there and he starts laying in there
[57:20] about about the Christian walk about
[57:23] about the reproach of Christ and how
[57:25] that how that this Christian walk has
[57:27] has been reproached by the scoffers and
[57:29] the mockers and the critics of this
[57:31] world and I was listening I was
[57:33] listening back to it yesterday and I
[57:35] heard something I heard something quite
[57:37] profound and brother Ram was talking
[57:39] about Mary how that she met the angel
[57:41] and how she come in contact with the
[57:42] angel and the angel had told her to stop
[57:45] there and that that she was going to be
[57:46] overshadowed with the Holy Ghost and
[57:48] that the very child that was going to be
[57:50] in her would be a child of the Holy
[57:52] Ghost and brother Rams would say that he
[57:55] said now there was a lot of people that
[57:56] was critics and there was mockers about
[57:58] saying that that this was Joseph's child
[58:00] or this was A Soldier's child and I this
[58:03] is what I found so so incredible is that
[58:05] brother random said that but Mary knew
[58:09] Mary knew whose child that was you see
[58:11] the Bride of Jesus Christ knows whose
[58:13] seed that she is carrying because she
[58:16] knows the mate that she's been with any
[58:18] woman knows who seed that she's carrying
[58:20] this is not a this is not an affair she
[58:23] didn't pick this seat up out there on
[58:24] the street somewhere but literally she
[58:27] knows that she's been in contact with a
[58:29] husband she's been in contact and she
[58:32] knows what she carried this bride ain't
[58:34] carrying serpent seed this bride is
[58:36] carrying a spoken word genan seed of
[58:39] almighty God that has anointed this L
[58:41] the lady in this
[58:43] generation you look at it even thus
[58:46] shall it be in the days when the son of
[58:48] man is being revealed that you are
[58:51] carrying around a seed that is greater
[58:53] than Mary come on this seed that Mary
[58:56] was C carrying was greater than herself
[59:01] do you realize that you are here to show
[59:04] forth and magnify Jesus Christ the seed
[59:08] on the inside of you is greater than
[59:10] your flesh so the seed is not going to
[59:12] let your flesh get in your way the seed
[59:16] is not going to let your sickness get in
[59:18] the
[59:21] way
[59:23] Hallelujah brother Brandon would say
[59:26] this and the anointed ones at the end
[59:29] time he said three things lay before you
[59:32] right now I wish I'd sent this upstairs
[59:35] so that you could read it along with me
[59:36] but you can find it he said three things
[59:39] lay before you right now first the world
[59:42] is in a Sodom condition Jesus said it
[59:45] would happen look at the perversion our
[59:47] women trying to act like men our men
[59:50] trying to act like women cified rotten
[59:53] filthy low down devil possessed and
[59:55] don't know it the Bible said that would
[59:57] happen and that's where it's at secondly
[1:00:00] in that hour according to the scriptures
[1:00:02] that Janice and jambus appear he said
[1:00:04] that's secondly he said thirdly that
[1:00:06] it's in that same hour that the son of
[1:00:09] man is to be re revealed so you look at
[1:00:12] the the you look at the thermometer of
[1:00:15] where we were you see that Abraham is up
[1:00:18] there he's having a conference with one
[1:00:20] and you look at lot where he's at and
[1:00:23] you could see the perversion of of Sodom
[1:00:25] and Gomorrah you could see the you can
[1:00:27] see the impersonations of Janice and
[1:00:29] jambre he said but it's in that same
[1:00:31] hour that the son of man is going to be
[1:00:36] revealed now he says now there is your
[1:00:39] believer he said there is your believer
[1:00:42] your make believer and your unbeliever
[1:00:44] and I absolutely love this quote because
[1:00:46] you notice watch this how brother
[1:00:48] brandom interchanges the word believer
[1:00:51] to genuine Vindication he said there is
[1:00:54] your genuine word standing out
[1:00:56] Vindicated he said there's your make
[1:00:58] believer imperson impersonating it and
[1:01:01] there's your unbeliever rejecting the
[1:01:03] whole thing you realize that is exactly
[1:01:06] who you are you're more than just
[1:01:08] identified as a Believer but you are the
[1:01:11] Vindicated word of this hour made
[1:01:13] manifest that right here you see those
[1:01:16] three things that are fully manifested
[1:01:19] before you you see Sodom Rising on every
[1:01:21] every condition you try to protect your
[1:01:24] children as much as you can from it but
[1:01:26] it's right there in their face you see
[1:01:29] the impersonation of Christianity and it
[1:01:31] ain't them people it's a spirit that's
[1:01:34] on them that's trying to impersonate it
[1:01:36] but right here in the midst of it in the
[1:01:38] midst of all of it there's a people that
[1:01:41] is Anointed and to be V the Vindicated
[1:01:44] word of the hour made
[1:01:46] manifest you see Jesus said that man is
[1:01:49] not going to it's not it's not going to
[1:01:51] live by bread alone but he's literally
[1:01:53] got to live by every word that proceeds
[1:01:56] out of the mouth of God now in the seven
[1:01:59] Church ages brother Bram said now God's
[1:02:01] intention for his creation he said
[1:02:04] managed to express his word in Genesis
[1:02:06] Adam was given the word to live by a
[1:02:09] life lived by the word would be the word
[1:02:11] express he said that is true is it not
[1:02:14] but did Adam live by that word no
[1:02:16] because he was to live by every word and
[1:02:19] he failed to take heed of every word and
[1:02:22] if you and I are going to if we are
[1:02:24] intent on over coming Le oosa and
[1:02:27] Satan's Eden then we've got to live by
[1:02:29] the word of
[1:02:30] God come on somebody it ain't just good
[1:02:32] to talk about it ain't just to have good
[1:02:34] to have around you got to live by it I I
[1:02:38] I can tell you this I I think I think my
[1:02:40] wife's one of the best cooks in in the
[1:02:42] world and I I I have no problem picking
[1:02:44] out when we go to a potluck which is
[1:02:46] hers and which is not I I've done ate
[1:02:48] her food quite quite a long time now and
[1:02:50] I really enjoy it but you know my wife
[1:02:53] is pretty she's she's a pretty good
[1:02:55] bread maker and she you know and she she
[1:02:59] got on that Trend you know of making
[1:03:00] that sour dough and and I I tell you
[1:03:02] what I'm reaping the benefits of
[1:03:05] it but you know my my wife went through
[1:03:07] the struggles of of of figuring out the
[1:03:10] the recipe and figuring out all the
[1:03:12] criteria that it takes and all the
[1:03:13] things of it it honestly it kind of uh
[1:03:17] it overwhelmed her at first thing I'll
[1:03:19] never get this then I'd say we'd
[1:03:21] probably done ate a th000 loaves by now
[1:03:23] by the time we done figured all them
[1:03:25] bread we we done ate up you know and and
[1:03:28] she I've sat there and I enjoy watching
[1:03:30] I ain't never helped her do it and I uh
[1:03:32] just I just watch her do it cuz I figure
[1:03:34] if I mess it up I I'm going to be the
[1:03:35] guilty part he got to eat that thing and
[1:03:38] so I I've watched her sit there and I've
[1:03:40] went to the grocery store for and I've
[1:03:41] picked up the flour and I I've picked up
[1:03:44] the ingredients for her and I've watched
[1:03:45] her make it and I put it all I put it
[1:03:47] out there and I I've helped her get it
[1:03:49] together but I ain't never made it one
[1:03:51] time but I tell you what she's really
[1:03:53] good at it she can she can I tell you
[1:03:55] what sisters I know maybe you probably
[1:03:57] got the best sough recipe but I I at my
[1:04:00] house for me in my house we choose Katie
[1:04:02] Spencer's sough bread you know I I sat
[1:04:06] there and I you know I ain't never put
[1:04:07] it together I ain't never read the
[1:04:09] recipe probably it probably scared me to
[1:04:11] death try to do it but you know if if I
[1:04:14] would sit there and maybe she could take
[1:04:16] some time and maybe she could teach me
[1:04:18] how to do it I might be able to do it I
[1:04:20] might be able to learn it just a little
[1:04:21] bit but you see just having all the
[1:04:24] ingredients doesn't put it to together
[1:04:26] just having all the ingredients doesn't
[1:04:28] make you live by it but literally where
[1:04:31] the life is is when all them ingredients
[1:04:33] that I that I enjoyed going picking up
[1:04:35] and when I went out there and I enjoyed
[1:04:37] picking up the flower and then I watched
[1:04:39] her put it together the life is it is
[1:04:41] when it's put together there's a lot of
[1:04:43] people that talk about the message
[1:04:45] there's a lot of people that that look
[1:04:47] at the message but the power of it is
[1:04:50] not even putting it together the power
[1:04:52] is eating
[1:04:54] it this this lamb this bread died for
[1:04:58] you but the power is eating it you can
[1:05:02] look at the recipe you can have the
[1:05:04] finest recipe on how to overcome Satan's
[1:05:07] eating but if you don't eat it if you
[1:05:10] don't put it together if you don't feed
[1:05:12] on it it ain't doing you nothing good
[1:05:14] but just having it in your home but if
[1:05:16] you start eating on it you've been given
[1:05:20] the greatest ingredients of the hour to
[1:05:23] overcome Satan's eating we as a body of
[1:05:26] Jesus Christ have received a message to
[1:05:29] give
[1:05:30] life man shall I live by bread alone but
[1:05:34] by every word that proceeds out this
[1:05:36] message came right from the Throne of
[1:05:39] almighty God I am the bread of
[1:05:45] life the Bible said in Romans 9:33
[1:05:48] you're very familiar with it as it is
[1:05:49] written behold I lay in Zion every time
[1:05:52] you see Zion in the Bible it is it is is
[1:05:55] a symbol of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:58] behold I lay in Zion's tumbling stone
[1:06:01] and a rock of offence that whosoever
[1:06:03] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:06:06] what is this to us this is an
[1:06:09] announcement this is the scripture that
[1:06:12] the when the angels of the Lord came to
[1:06:14] him came to William brandham and dealt
[1:06:16] with him about the seals he said my
[1:06:18] Bible was open to Romans chapter 9 and
[1:06:21] verse
[1:06:23] 33 he said it was open to that scripture
[1:06:27] you see what was it it was a
[1:06:29] declaration that this message is causing
[1:06:33] a separation between the false and the
[1:06:36] True Believers you see a Believer is
[1:06:38] always going to be met with opposition
[1:06:41] they're always going to be B battling
[1:06:43] for truth but in the midst of the
[1:06:45] reproach there is an absolute and it
[1:06:48] might look like the end and we're in the
[1:06:50] middle of a contest but there is a bride
[1:06:53] that is unmovable unshake able and she
[1:06:56] is Anointed to
[1:06:58] stand Hallelujah yeah you're going to be
[1:07:01] in a contest yeah you're going to have
[1:07:03] to battle for this
[1:07:05] truth every one of you are going to have
[1:07:07] to battle I'll tell you this believing
[1:07:09] this message is not the easiest thing
[1:07:11] you can do in life but it is the
[1:07:15] greatest your family will turn against
[1:07:17] you your friends will turn against you
[1:07:20] but I say this unto you it's life it's
[1:07:23] an anointing it's it's a power it's
[1:07:27] worth the struggle it's worth the battle
[1:07:30] it's worth
[1:07:32] it h and I believe that this message
[1:07:36] will change our
[1:07:40] bodies ah brother Andrew I say you're
[1:07:43] anointed to believe
[1:07:45] it say I'm anointed to believe it I'm
[1:07:49] anointed to believe it there's an open
[1:07:51] door and I'm stepping into it I'm
[1:07:54] anointed to believe it I'm anointed to
[1:07:56] accept it I'm anointed to eat it I'm
[1:07:59] anointed to prophesy I'm anointed to
[1:08:01] stand against the enemy I'm anointed to
[1:08:03] defeat Satan I'm anointed to overcome
[1:08:06] I'm anointed in the presence of my
[1:08:08] enemies I have been anointed by
[1:08:11] receiving a prophet's message and I'm
[1:08:13] anointed for a body
[1:08:15] change I'm
[1:08:17] anointed I'm
[1:08:23] anointed brother brand comes T night
[1:08:26] 1961 re preaches a very powerful
[1:08:29] message on the
[1:08:32] Messiah brother random lays in there
[1:08:35] believe it's 16 times that he lays in
[1:08:38] there on the word Messiah brother random
[1:08:41] starts laying it in there and he starts
[1:08:42] talking about the the prophets of old
[1:08:44] and the the sages of old how that they
[1:08:47] were Messiahs he said but they were
[1:08:50] Anointed with the same spirit that was
[1:08:52] on Jesus he said but they only had it
[1:08:56] they only had it in a partial sense he
[1:08:58] said but when Jesus came when Jesus came
[1:09:01] he was the fullness thereof he was the
[1:09:03] very life of Elohim in human flesh and
[1:09:07] brother manam turns it he said now no
[1:09:09] longer no longer are you just a people
[1:09:13] but you are Messiah that you are
[1:09:16] anointed with the same spirit that was
[1:09:18] on Jesus of Nazareth that same Spirit
[1:09:22] has come back around to you he said no
[1:09:24] wonder that Elijah could go up there to
[1:09:27] that dead boy's room and lay his body on
[1:09:30] that dead boy and he could come back to
[1:09:33] life again because it wasn't Elijah's
[1:09:35] life it was the Life of Christ that had
[1:09:38] lay down on a dead body and I say this
[1:09:41] you can lay your dead sins you can lay
[1:09:43] your dead self over top of this message
[1:09:47] and if you are elected you'll come to
[1:09:50] life you might feel like you're unworthy
[1:09:53] to get here
[1:09:55] you might feel like you don't measure up
[1:09:57] to everybody else but let me say this
[1:10:00] you're predestinated to sit at the
[1:10:04] table I spoken to an individual just
[1:10:07] just the other day about taking away the
[1:10:10] measuring tape you might never measure
[1:10:12] up to what you think brother Homer was
[1:10:14] or or brother brother Ron is or brother
[1:10:16] brandom take the measure and tape
[1:10:19] away because the way I look at it is
[1:10:22] election is
[1:10:24] election it does doesn't matter Come On
[1:10:26] Son it doesn't matter whether you ever
[1:10:28] see a vision whether you ever prophesy I
[1:10:31] say election is election I said
[1:10:34] predestination is
[1:10:36] predestination the only measuring tape
[1:10:39] that you ought to have in your hand is
[1:10:41] what side of the table that you're
[1:10:42] sitting
[1:10:44] on it matters what T what side of the
[1:10:47] table that you're sitting on I know what
[1:10:49] side I'm sitting on because I got an
[1:10:51] enemy in front of me that's screaming at
[1:10:54] me so the only only measureing tape that
[1:10:56] the Bride of Jesus Christ needs is what
[1:10:58] side of the table are you sitting
[1:11:06] on brother Andrew I don't
[1:11:10] like I don't like
[1:11:12] rejection I don't like obstacles I don't
[1:11:15] like opposition I don't like trouble if
[1:11:18] you're going to be a Christian you
[1:11:20] better get used to
[1:11:22] it come on somebody if you're going to
[1:11:25] live a Christian Life you better get
[1:11:27] used to the devil tormenting you and try
[1:11:30] to kill you and try to destroy you come
[1:11:33] on some he don't want to just make you
[1:11:35] sick he wants to kill
[1:11:37] you that Devil's after your family that
[1:11:40] Devil's after your spirit that Devil's
[1:11:42] after your job that Devil's after
[1:11:44] everything that you touch why because
[1:11:47] you're blessed and he's trying his best
[1:11:50] to curse what you touch but before I
[1:11:53] touched it almighty God put me in
[1:11:59] [Applause]
[1:12:04] it Elijah done went through some
[1:12:06] powerful things he done went through
[1:12:08] some battles but when it come to a
[1:12:11] showdown between Bale and almighty God
[1:12:15] there he was Jezebel had done turn
[1:12:18] Israel she done turn Israel to
[1:12:20] worshiping false gods she had literally
[1:12:22] turned their heart
[1:12:25] you think worship doesn't turn
[1:12:29] you Jezebel's worship turned Israel's
[1:12:34] heart now no matter what Israel got
[1:12:36] themselves into they were always
[1:12:40] God's I tell you what if you want to
[1:12:42] find some powerful things go look
[1:12:44] through the Old Testament you talk about
[1:12:46] you talk about when when God put Israel
[1:12:49] to the side how she went a whing and all
[1:12:52] those things and how that she completely
[1:12:54] went away and God put it away and God
[1:12:57] put her down there in Babylon God let
[1:12:59] all these things happen but never did
[1:13:01] God change his mind about Israel she was
[1:13:04] always
[1:13:05] his in the midst of Babylon there was a
[1:13:10] Daniel in the midst of Jezebel There Was
[1:13:13] Elijah but Elijah wasn't alone there was
[1:13:16] 7,000 down there that had not bowed the
[1:13:19] need of
[1:13:21] bail I say this to you Church of you're
[1:13:23] not alone in this battle
[1:13:25] there's more Believers in this in just
[1:13:28] what you see in this
[1:13:30] church come on put your shoulder to the
[1:13:32] wheel let's live this
[1:13:39] message Jezebel had turned their
[1:13:43] hearts to
[1:13:46] believing there's power in
[1:13:49] believing they had
[1:13:51] turned back to beli in a false god how
[1:13:55] many times did they have flipflop back
[1:13:57] and forth on what side they were on but
[1:13:59] it come time for a
[1:14:01] showdown I want you to I want you to
[1:14:03] Vision this mountain Elijah's climbing
[1:14:07] this mountain to be honest the odds are
[1:14:10] stacked up against
[1:14:13] Elijah it ain't
[1:14:16] rained it ain't rained in three
[1:14:21] years and here they are he's putting
[1:14:24] himself up at now the first one that can
[1:14:26] get fire to fall I'll be honest you
[1:14:28] strike two rocks together in that sense
[1:14:30] I tell you what you can have a
[1:14:32] fire you know good and well how it gets
[1:14:34] in the summertime around here you're
[1:14:35] scared to death to well some people
[1:14:38] ain't you're scared to death to set a
[1:14:40] fire you're afraid you like the whole
[1:14:41] Woods on fire and be obligated to
[1:14:43] something you didn't even mean to
[1:14:44] do here they were they was up there
[1:14:46] beating on rocks and screaming and hes
[1:14:49] just down there laughing at him go ahead
[1:14:52] scream a little louder shout a little my
[1:14:55] should throw some rocks in the air just
[1:14:57] laughing at
[1:14:58] them they couldn't do nothing about it
[1:15:01] why because the altar wasn't fixed the
[1:15:05] altar wasn't restored they needed
[1:15:07] Jehovah Rafa to come through Elijah and
[1:15:10] to heal the broken heart to heal the
[1:15:13] altar to put it back in order that's why
[1:15:16] the ministry of Malachi 4 had to come is
[1:15:19] because you are able to defeat Satan
[1:15:22] it's because your heart has been turned
[1:15:26] the altar has been turned back to
[1:15:30] believing now when you look at in Psalms
[1:15:34] chapter
[1:15:37] 23 Bible said thou
[1:15:39] preparest a table before me in the
[1:15:43] presence of my enemies now anointest my
[1:15:46] head with oil my cup run over you look
[1:15:50] that word prepare in the Hebrew it means
[1:15:54] to arange it means to put to lay in
[1:15:57] order to set in Array to prepare it
[1:15:59] means to order it means to ordain it
[1:16:01] means to handle furnish esteem equal
[1:16:04] direct compare the word table comes from
[1:16:08] a direct word of the king's
[1:16:12] table this word is used in in Leviticus
[1:16:15] when when Moses says setting up the
[1:16:18] levitical priesthood in verse 7 and the
[1:16:21] sons of Aaron and the priest ver chapter
[1:16:23] one and the priest shall put fire upon
[1:16:24] on the Altar and lay the wood in order
[1:16:27] it shall
[1:16:28] prepare the wood in order upon the fire
[1:16:32] and the priest and Aaron son shall lay
[1:16:33] the parts of the head and the fat in
[1:16:35] order in order upon the wood that is on
[1:16:38] the fire which is upon the altar first
[1:16:40] Samuel and 17 and 21 for Israel and the
[1:16:43] Philistines have put the battle in Array
[1:16:46] it means to prepare it means to ordain
[1:16:51] kind of like the woman when she saw
[1:16:53] Jesus sitting at a
[1:16:55] table and she saw him sitting over there
[1:16:57] in a corner and nobody would worship Him
[1:17:00] and nobody would nobody would take care
[1:17:03] of him but brother random said that she
[1:17:05] was ordained to do it she was ordained
[1:17:07] to go in there brother random said that
[1:17:09] there's something about Jesus is when he
[1:17:12] if you ever catch the G glimpse of him
[1:17:15] and if there's ever something on the
[1:17:16] inside of you he said there's something
[1:17:18] that'll come to life no matter what
[1:17:21] others may not pay no attention to it
[1:17:23] but if you are ordained to lie
[1:17:25] you'll catch the first view of it and
[1:17:27] there's something different this woman
[1:17:30] when Simon was making a mockery out of
[1:17:32] Jesus this woman came to the table where
[1:17:35] Jesus was and made him feel
[1:17:38] welcome you may not been welcomed in the
[1:17:41] room by somebody
[1:17:45] else but the master is waiting on
[1:17:49] you to come to his table and to wash his
[1:17:53] feet there might be other others that
[1:17:55] refuse to wash him there might be others
[1:17:57] that refuse to acknowledge how great he
[1:18:00] is but you are ordained to come to the
[1:18:05] table you ordained to it and you notice
[1:18:09] now when you go to studying out ancient
[1:18:11] history and over in the East that when
[1:18:14] when somebody one of the most the
[1:18:17] greatest Honors that ancient east can
[1:18:21] can bestow upon a person is when you
[1:18:24] have them come set at your
[1:18:28] table I'll just be honest when you sit
[1:18:30] with somebody in still from the Eastern
[1:18:34] countries it is one of the greatest
[1:18:36] honors for them to come and sit down at
[1:18:37] your table because at your table is
[1:18:41] where there is peace at your table that
[1:18:44] is where you are fed at your table that
[1:18:46] is where there is family conversations
[1:18:49] and that there at that table it is the
[1:18:52] greatest it is the greatest of heart
[1:18:54] Harmony that transpires around that
[1:18:57] table but also it is also known that
[1:19:01] when a host begins to invite someone to
[1:19:03] their table it also means absolute
[1:19:08] protection that when you are invited to
[1:19:12] this person's table that no matter who
[1:19:15] you are it doesn't matter if you are a
[1:19:18] foreign mercenary if you are invited to
[1:19:21] the king's table no matter the enemy
[1:19:24] enemy that has that has said that he was
[1:19:27] going to destroy you the enemy cannot
[1:19:30] come to you at that table because he
[1:19:32] would not dare to attack a guest under
[1:19:35] that host care so God will literally
[1:19:39] Place Us in
[1:19:41] situations that we literally have to
[1:19:44] have to trust him despite of the
[1:19:46] opposition that is sitting out there you
[1:19:49] might have opposition outside that is
[1:19:53] waiting on you but as long long as you
[1:19:55] are at this table you are under the host
[1:19:59] care I say it matters who's your
[1:20:02] host I say it matters who's your host it
[1:20:06] matters who sets the
[1:20:09] table the anointing in this
[1:20:12] hour is sent here to combat the very
[1:20:16] powers of
[1:20:17] hell but it's also meant to take you to
[1:20:20] a
[1:20:22] power who invited you here
[1:20:25] who invited you to this
[1:20:28] table what has anointed you to come to
[1:20:30] this table what has brought you to this
[1:20:33] place I want to say it again the
[1:20:36] anointing that has been dispersed in
[1:20:38] this generation is here to uh combat the
[1:20:41] powers of hell but it is also here to
[1:20:43] put you in power you see just like David
[1:20:47] was anointed to be king it wasn't just
[1:20:49] so that he could be anointed to be king
[1:20:51] he was anointed to be placed in power
[1:20:54] come on somebody he wasn't just anointed
[1:20:56] to kill D
[1:20:58] Goliath it was more of the David's story
[1:21:01] than just killing Goliath there's more
[1:21:03] to your story than just killing the old
[1:21:05] man there's more David was anointed for
[1:21:08] battle David was anointed for worship
[1:21:11] David was anointed for influence he draw
[1:21:14] men from all walks of life to him and
[1:21:17] David was anointed to
[1:21:21] restore you're anointed more than just
[1:21:25] to sit on the other side and look at the
[1:21:27] enemy you're anointed for power you're
[1:21:31] anointed you're anointed to win the
[1:21:33] battle you're anointed for a purpose
[1:21:36] you're anointed to possess you're
[1:21:41] anointed and the reason why Satan cannot
[1:21:45] take your life before God allows him is
[1:21:49] because of who you
[1:21:51] are you are a genan SE
[1:21:55] of almighty God somebody say I am The
[1:21:58] Offspring of God I am a child of God I
[1:22:02] am a gene of almighty God I am
[1:22:05] predestinated I am ordained I am
[1:22:09] anointed it's more than just saying it
[1:22:12] Church the message proves that your
[1:22:14] anointing is here the message proves
[1:22:17] what's been spoken in this generation is
[1:22:19] the truth it's life it's power David
[1:22:24] wasn't just anointed to be king yeah
[1:22:26] that was great but he was anointed to
[1:22:28] restore he was anointed to influence and
[1:22:31] you have been anointed let me say this
[1:22:33] church you have been anointed to take
[1:22:35] everything that the enemy has stolen
[1:22:37] away from
[1:22:38] you you remember what the Bible said in
[1:22:40] Genesis chapter 22 when Abraham found
[1:22:43] out that he was Jehovah Gyra he said thy
[1:22:46] seed shall possess the Gate of its
[1:22:48] enemies and thy seed thy seed what is on
[1:22:52] the inside of you it's a royal seed
[1:22:55] William brandham said in possessing the
[1:22:56] enemy's gates in the Church of the
[1:22:58] Living God lays the power to heal all
[1:23:06] sickness in the Church of the Living God
[1:23:09] lays the power to heal all sickness he
[1:23:13] ain't saying it's up there in heaven he
[1:23:15] ain't saying it's back there at the
[1:23:16] cross but in the Church of the Living
[1:23:19] God lays the power what is that power
[1:23:23] it's an anointing that comes from
[1:23:25] Calvary in the Church of the Living God
[1:23:27] lays power to overcome all temptation in
[1:23:30] the possession of the Church of the
[1:23:31] Living God this morning lays the power
[1:23:34] to change sin and throw it
[1:23:41] away get rid of
[1:23:44] it get rid of it the thing that keeps
[1:23:47] making you disbelieve this message get
[1:23:49] rid of it I say if it's your friends
[1:23:52] young people get rid of it this let in
[1:23:55] this power lays the power to change your
[1:23:59] sin and throw it
[1:24:03] away you know how easy it is take a
[1:24:05] trash out come on somebody why don't you
[1:24:08] carry some trash out why don't you carry
[1:24:11] that doubt out and throw it in a bin why
[1:24:13] don't you carry that fear out and throw
[1:24:15] it in a bin why don't you carry out that
[1:24:17] complex and throw it in a bin come on
[1:24:21] take that fear out take it out take it
[1:24:24] out that fear ain't got nothing new with
[1:24:26] you that comes straight from the pits of
[1:24:32] Hell let me have it that ain't my sin
[1:24:35] but I want to take that back it was just
[1:24:38] illustration God have mercy you know
[1:24:41] what brother I'll tell you what I thank
[1:24:43] God for this message it's simple but
[1:24:46] here I am brother mam said in the Easter
[1:24:48] seal he said Easter ruined all their
[1:24:50] theology because they had said all kinds
[1:24:53] of things about this man but this man
[1:24:55] was anointed not just to heal the sick
[1:24:57] he was not just anointed to preach the
[1:24:59] gospel he was anointed like no other
[1:25:01] man's been anointed to raise up from the
[1:25:03] grave he said you could take try to take
[1:25:05] my life from it but on the third day
[1:25:07] I'll raise it up again let me say this
[1:25:10] to you it ruined their theology because
[1:25:12] they tried to lock him in there they
[1:25:14] tried to seal him in there they tried to
[1:25:16] create lies but the reason why they
[1:25:18] theology is ruined is because you're
[1:25:21] here hallelujah that se
[1:25:24] that resurrection power that came down
[1:25:27] from heaven is in
[1:25:29] you brother Mar would say it in the
[1:25:32] restoration of the Bride tree he said
[1:25:34] now he said the vine has got to put
[1:25:37] forth a branch and when it comes forth
[1:25:39] it's going to Bear the same thing that
[1:25:41] the vine did so it's going to carry and
[1:25:44] bear the very power that the vine had is
[1:25:47] that right so it's Easter again in the
[1:25:50] believer's hearts it's Resurrection
[1:25:52] again he's got people everywhere that
[1:25:55] it's Easter for them I love this he said
[1:25:58] it's Easter again the Royal seed has
[1:26:01] been hid in The Roots the word headd
[1:26:03] back there in this word for years and
[1:26:05] years and years and just now to begin to
[1:26:08] reveal he said it's predestinated from
[1:26:10] the foundation of the world this church
[1:26:12] begins to stand stand again in the
[1:26:14] anointed ones he said the True Vine and
[1:26:17] the false Vine have the same
[1:26:21] anointing he went on to say they look
[1:26:24] the same they're anointed the same but
[1:26:27] by their fruit you know them he said the
[1:26:30] church that believes in Jesus Christ
[1:26:32] will do the works of Jesus Christ it'll
[1:26:35] have the life of Jesus Christ and if it
[1:26:37] isn't no matter if the life is pouring
[1:26:39] into it if it isn't predestinated from
[1:26:42] The Roots it'll bear something different
[1:26:46] but if it's predestinated life in the
[1:26:48] roots it'll bear Jesus Christ the same
[1:26:51] yesterday today and forever if it's a
[1:26:54] word coming up through the root which he
[1:26:57] is a root and the beginning of
[1:27:03] it that when Satan come in in the form
[1:27:06] of them
[1:27:08] bugs he couldn't get to
[1:27:12] you you remember when brother brand goes
[1:27:14] up there in Canada and he's going
[1:27:16] through there and he's driving through
[1:27:17] and that there's that big
[1:27:20] burnover he said it was real spooky
[1:27:24] reminds me of a lot of these dead cold
[1:27:27] churches he said when the wind would hit
[1:27:29] them he said they would move back and
[1:27:30] forth oo he's a real spooky he said then
[1:27:34] I got to Noti and that he said I kept
[1:27:36] hearing this little sound maybe it was
[1:27:38] Full Gospel Lighthouse he was hearing
[1:27:41] maybe it was even in L Tabernacle he was
[1:27:43] hearing maybe maybe it was the Church of
[1:27:45] Christ maybe it was over there over
[1:27:48] there with George Quinn and the
[1:27:49] Believers there in Ireland or maybe
[1:27:51] maybe it was with the brothers and
[1:27:52] sisters over there in Belgium or maybe
[1:27:54] it was over there with the brothers and
[1:27:55] sisters from Tanzania maybe he be to see
[1:27:58] something and he said I hear that sound
[1:28:00] and he said I wondered what that was he
[1:28:03] said in the midst of all that big
[1:28:04] burnover when those people that had
[1:28:06] refused to worship God he said down
[1:28:08] there there was some undergrowth that
[1:28:10] the fire couldn't get to that the fire
[1:28:13] couldn't stop and when the wind hit it
[1:28:15] he said it just rustled back and forth
[1:28:18] there's a lot of people that don't
[1:28:19] understand your worship there's a lot of
[1:28:21] people that don't understand the way
[1:28:22] that you get up and praise God at the
[1:28:24] preaching of the word it's because the
[1:28:28] wind the wind makes you
[1:28:31] move let me say this the fires of Hell
[1:28:33] cannot stop you if the root has been
[1:28:36] predestinated from almighty God there is
[1:28:39] nothing I say this to you you are
[1:28:41] predestinated to believe Against All
[1:28:44] Odds brother brandham said in the Feast
[1:28:46] of the trumpets that to believe is the
[1:28:49] evidence of the Holy
[1:28:51] Spirit I know there's a lot of Baptists
[1:28:53] around the message that
[1:28:54] I appreciate you saying that brother
[1:28:57] Andrew I'm going to say this that
[1:28:59] believing is not just walking there's a
[1:29:01] lot of Baptist that enjoy a good easy
[1:29:03] believism that just confess it and walk
[1:29:05] out and do their own sin and enjoy their
[1:29:07] own life but let me say that let me read
[1:29:09] the quote on a little bit further he
[1:29:11] said now you can't pronounce that just
[1:29:13] going to church is the evidence of the
[1:29:14] Holy Ghost if you do then the Pharisees
[1:29:17] had it you can't pronounce it shaking or
[1:29:20] jumping he said if you do the heathens
[1:29:22] has got you you can't say that speaking
[1:29:24] in tongues he said why because the
[1:29:27] Devils worship and they speak in tongues
[1:29:29] don't they but believing is the evidence
[1:29:33] of the Holy Spirit what is it it's not
[1:29:36] just confessing but believing is an
[1:29:39] action
[1:29:40] word it's an action word that's why
[1:29:43] James 2:7 said even so faith if it hath
[1:29:47] not works is dead and being alone faith
[1:29:50] is action it ain't just talking about it
[1:29:55] I happen to believe that William Brandon
[1:29:56] wasn't just talking about squirrels I
[1:29:59] believe it happened I believe it
[1:30:00] something
[1:30:02] rolled as he said a super anointing come
[1:30:06] sweeping down through Sportsman holla
[1:30:08] and it came through there and it
[1:30:10] produced exactly what I was looking for
[1:30:13] so what am I saying that true true
[1:30:16] belief produces
[1:30:21] action there's a lot of people that's
[1:30:23] when their Church there's a lot of
[1:30:25] people that's read their Bible there's a
[1:30:27] lot of people that are good people but
[1:30:30] if it's true belief it'll sh in you what
[1:30:33] you
[1:30:34] do that's why Noah built an
[1:30:37] ark that's right he believed the warning
[1:30:40] that God said that's why Moses got there
[1:30:44] and killed all them Lambs he believed
[1:30:47] they were
[1:30:48] leaving come on somebody come on
[1:30:51] somebody that's why Daniel didn't stop
[1:30:53] praying he realized that God would hear
[1:30:56] him he believed
[1:31:02] it the Bible said in I uh sorry Psalms
[1:31:06] chapter 78 78
[1:31:09] and10 here you find when the Israelites
[1:31:12] were murmuring they said the Bible said
[1:31:14] they kept not the Covenant of God and
[1:31:17] refused to walk in his
[1:31:18] law go down to verse 19 and the Bible
[1:31:21] said and yet y they spake against God
[1:31:26] they said can God furnish a table in the
[1:31:32] wilderness now I'll be
[1:31:34] honest out of any generation to this
[1:31:37] time there was not anybody that had
[1:31:39] seen the dispensation or the display of
[1:31:42] almighty God like the children of Israel
[1:31:45] so basically when you boil down what
[1:31:47] they are saying they are calling into
[1:31:50] question the ability of God they were
[1:31:53] calling and saying that he is no longer
[1:31:56] the same they were saying that God has
[1:31:59] changed his name and that God is no
[1:32:02] longer Jehovah
[1:32:03] Gyra they are saying that he cannot
[1:32:06] provide for them in no matter what the
[1:32:10] circumstances may I just remind you how
[1:32:13] big God was to them when God began to
[1:32:16] rain down Mana from
[1:32:19] Heaven that when he begin to rain it
[1:32:21] down the amount per person to each
[1:32:23] Israelite received an R which is about 2
[1:32:26] lers per
[1:32:28] day so in total the amount per day that
[1:32:32] was poured out upon the
[1:32:34] Israelites if if we look at it that
[1:32:36] brother Randon would say that the
[1:32:37] Israelites that the children of Israel
[1:32:39] were around 2 million people so if we
[1:32:42] believe it was 2 million people that
[1:32:44] mean God provided 4 million quartz every
[1:32:49] single day he provided 3600 tons in
[1:32:54] excess every single day over a year he
[1:32:58] provided 1.3 million tons of
[1:33:02] mana and here they're saying that God
[1:33:05] can't do
[1:33:07] it when he begin to rain down quailes
[1:33:11] from heaven in numbers you find it in
[1:33:13] numbers 11 you'll find that the quail
[1:33:16] begin to pile up three feet deep around
[1:33:18] the camp and the Bible said that it
[1:33:20] stretched out a Day's Journey in every
[1:33:23] direction so 15 miles that way and 15
[1:33:26] milesi that way was nothing but quails
[1:33:29] now I have to be honest with you the way
[1:33:30] I shoot that's probably about the only
[1:33:32] chance I'd ever have at hitting a
[1:33:35] squail I'd have a good chance at
[1:33:39] end so let me put it into perspective
[1:33:43] each person gathered 10 homers of
[1:33:47] quail that's about 60
[1:33:50] bushels it's about 475
[1:33:54] gallons of quail per
[1:33:57] person I tell you what that's my kind of
[1:33:59] hunting right there I might be able to
[1:34:02] do some good right there let me ask you
[1:34:04] something is he still Jehovah
[1:34:07] Gyra is he still Jehova did he put you
[1:34:11] right down here in Satan's Eden and
[1:34:12] leave you
[1:34:14] without did he leave you without did he
[1:34:17] did he did he not give you enough that
[1:34:19] you could stand there and say nah I
[1:34:20] don't believe he's still God did he did
[1:34:23] he not do enough enough for Georgie
[1:34:24] Carter to make you believe did he not do
[1:34:27] enough for Charlie Mitchell that was a
[1:34:28] coal miner that had cancer in his lungs
[1:34:31] never seen William brandham was visited
[1:34:34] had been brought there by by my my
[1:34:36] father's former Pastor Ernest vulture
[1:34:39] brought him up there William Bon didn't
[1:34:40] know nothing about him but he called him
[1:34:43] out when he's standing there and he said
[1:34:45] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:34:47] your ears did he not do enough for you
[1:34:50] when he healed that little girl down
[1:34:52] there in Memphis Tennessee
[1:34:54] did he not do enough for you when he
[1:34:56] created squirrels spoke to a storm
[1:34:59] created and destroyed tumors cast out
[1:35:02] cast out
[1:35:04] storms did he not do enough for
[1:35:08] you I say has I say he's still God I say
[1:35:13] he's still Jehovah
[1:35:20] [Applause]
[1:35:26] I want you to hear me loud and clear I
[1:35:29] never saw one of them Miracles but I
[1:35:32] believe
[1:35:35] him I want to say this that God would
[1:35:38] never have to do anything else for me to
[1:35:40] believe in him if he never did another
[1:35:43] miracle sister Gabrielle I would still
[1:35:45] trust him if he never healed me one more
[1:35:47] time I would still trust him if he
[1:35:49] didn't move on one other person's heart
[1:35:51] I would still trust him why because he's
[1:35:54] God to
[1:35:56] me if he didn't provide healing for my
[1:36:00] body one more time I would still realize
[1:36:04] that he has anointed me to stand in the
[1:36:05] face of my enemies why because he
[1:36:08] provided a message that is greater than
[1:36:10] Satan's
[1:36:13] eeden let the scoffers come let the
[1:36:15] mockers come I know who side of the
[1:36:17] table I'm
[1:36:22] on I know what side of the table I'm
[1:36:31] on now I I I studying I'm I'm I'm I'm
[1:36:34] bringing this to a close I pray I ain't
[1:36:36] hurt my body too much but I I feel I
[1:36:40] feel real
[1:36:42] good I
[1:36:44] studying and I was wanting to
[1:36:46] find exactly the
[1:36:49] amount and I it probably it probably
[1:36:53] escaped me but I was wondering to find
[1:36:55] how many times that Jesus stood in the
[1:36:58] face of critics and
[1:37:01] Believers people that believed in him
[1:37:04] and people that did not believe in
[1:37:06] him and the best of my recollection
[1:37:09] there's 13 times that Jesus is standing
[1:37:12] in front of critics that did not believe
[1:37:15] him but he was still anointed to heal he
[1:37:18] was still anointed to touch he was still
[1:37:21] anointed to save
[1:37:24] I I began to study that little that
[1:37:26] little thought that that's a very
[1:37:28] powerful thought I studyed that out and
[1:37:30] you look at Luke Chapter 5 and Matthew
[1:37:32] or Mark chapter 2 and you find that and
[1:37:35] I love it that the Bible said that that
[1:37:38] Jesus it was noised abroad that Jesus
[1:37:40] was in the
[1:37:43] house there ought to be some noise in
[1:37:46] here why because Jesus is in the
[1:37:50] house and Jesus begin to sit down at a
[1:37:53] table and he starts talking to
[1:37:55] them about Christ he starts talking to
[1:37:58] them about the scripture and he starts
[1:37:59] laying some fundamental foundations of
[1:38:01] who he is and what the scriptures
[1:38:04] are and all of a sudden they it's it's
[1:38:08] got so big that the house can't contain
[1:38:10] it no more and it kind of broke out like
[1:38:12] a wildfire and people have gathered all
[1:38:15] the way
[1:38:16] around and there was a there was a man
[1:38:18] that had some friends that was real good
[1:38:20] friends and they cared enough to get him
[1:38:22] in the house and they seen they couldn't
[1:38:24] get him through the doorways they
[1:38:26] couldn't get him through the windows and
[1:38:28] I believe that if you're persistent
[1:38:29] enough you'll get to where Jesus is
[1:38:31] at I say if it's if it's if it's noised
[1:38:34] alloud long loud enough I believe your
[1:38:37] friends will come
[1:38:42] here you hear me I believe that if you
[1:38:45] noise it loud enough that God saved you
[1:38:48] from a dying drunk drunken sinner I
[1:38:51] believe that if you announce it now I
[1:38:53] don't know whether they'll be elected or
[1:38:54] not but I believe this that if you
[1:38:56] announce it enough it'll cause an
[1:38:58] attraction it might be just for
[1:39:00] somebody's healing but for this man it
[1:39:02] was going to be worth it that he had
[1:39:04] some belev in friends that took their
[1:39:06] faith and they really believed it and
[1:39:09] they didn't just care about who saw them
[1:39:11] they begin to rip the shingles off the
[1:39:13] straw off and they begin to lower him
[1:39:16] down I say you ought to have that kind
[1:39:18] of Faith to tear the roof off this place
[1:39:26] but Jesus standing there and he looked
[1:39:30] at
[1:39:31] him and he said thy sins be
[1:39:36] forgiven let me say this it's one thing
[1:39:38] for me and brother William talk about it
[1:39:40] it's one thing for us as ministers and
[1:39:42] Christian Believers to talk about it but
[1:39:45] when you are in the face of the ultimate
[1:39:48] critic you talking about ultimate
[1:39:50] ultimate these are the best critics that
[1:39:53] was ever
[1:39:54] born as brother Matthew talked about it
[1:39:56] last night they had studied with
[1:39:58] everything that was with these are
[1:39:59] ultimate
[1:40:01] critics and Jesus begins to show who he
[1:40:04] is because the Bible said that he
[1:40:06] perceived that they said in their hearts
[1:40:09] what are these blasphemies that a man
[1:40:11] can be saved that thy sins are forgiven
[1:40:13] and Jesus picks it up he said let me ask
[1:40:16] you something is it harder to say that
[1:40:18] thy sins be forgiven or to say rise up
[1:40:21] and walk and he looked at the man he
[1:40:23] said thy sins be forgiven rise up and
[1:40:26] walk don't go back to your ped no more
[1:40:29] don't go back to your pity no more don't
[1:40:31] go back to your sin no more rise up and
[1:40:34] walk in the face of the critic across
[1:40:38] the
[1:40:39] table Jesus announces he is the son of
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:51] man I want to say this again God's
[1:40:53] already got your table
[1:40:55] set he's got your table set now I'm I'm
[1:40:58] just be real honest with
[1:41:00] you I love my wife more than anything
[1:41:02] she can't he be here today my little
[1:41:03] girl got a little temperature and she we
[1:41:06] been careful I love my wife's cooking
[1:41:08] more than I'll just be honest I Lord I'm
[1:41:11] gaining some points today
[1:41:14] Brothers didn't even mean to do it but
[1:41:16] praise
[1:41:19] God I love my wife's cooking I'm I'll
[1:41:21] just be honest with you I love it
[1:41:24] she Seasons things just the way I like
[1:41:26] them and when I don't like it that way
[1:41:28] she reminds me that I
[1:41:42] do I'll just be honest with you I love
[1:41:45] her cooking I love it she don't make him
[1:41:48] biscuits and gravies too much but thank
[1:41:49] God it's probably a good thing she
[1:41:52] don't y'all ought have seen them
[1:41:53] biscuits of gravy my teeny used to make
[1:41:55] had about that much oil in the bottom of
[1:41:57] the Pan Man our our ERS were so greased
[1:42:01] up I tell you what you could run on
[1:42:03] motor oil for the rest of your
[1:42:06] life I love her cooking I really do I
[1:42:09] tell you there so many things that she
[1:42:12] makes that are so
[1:42:14] good and I I love to come home and enjoy
[1:42:16] a good meal with her sit down at the
[1:42:19] table but if I really want to treat her
[1:42:22] like a like a wife to me I don't want
[1:42:25] her to have to fool with the dishes and
[1:42:27] fool with making me a good meal what I
[1:42:30] want to do I I'm sure some people enjoy
[1:42:34] good potluck every once in a while but I
[1:42:35] don't want to take my wife to a potluck
[1:42:38] when I want to take her somewhere nice
[1:42:40] but when I want to really take her
[1:42:42] somewhere nice it's not that often but
[1:42:43] when I really want to take her somewhere
[1:42:45] nice I've taken her them places that's
[1:42:47] got the lights turned down where you
[1:42:48] can't see whether there's a hair in your
[1:42:50] food or
[1:42:51] not you know what I mean is
[1:42:54] at least you got a candle there to make
[1:42:55] it more
[1:42:56] enjoyable hair is a beautiful thing
[1:42:58] until you falls off your head gets in
[1:43:00] your
[1:43:02] food it's
[1:43:04] amazing but to be honest I really don't
[1:43:06] want to spend all of my energies and
[1:43:09] watch her make all the meals and do all
[1:43:11] those things and just to sit back and
[1:43:13] say that was nice honey but if I really
[1:43:16] want to treat her right I take her to a
[1:43:18] real nice place where I know ain't going
[1:43:20] to be nothing like that everything's
[1:43:22] just right and I know she's going to
[1:43:24] like the food she ain't going to have to
[1:43:26] worry about it being good or not but
[1:43:27] it's real
[1:43:30] nice I want you to know that brother
[1:43:32] Brandon would say that that table is
[1:43:34] already

[1:44:07] to be in
[1:44:10] view I want I want to just get this very
[1:44:14] clear for you today if I I wish I I wish
