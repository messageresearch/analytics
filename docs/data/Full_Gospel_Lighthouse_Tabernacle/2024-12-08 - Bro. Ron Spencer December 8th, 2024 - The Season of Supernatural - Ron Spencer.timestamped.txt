[46:17] wonderful I just I just so enjoyed it
[46:22] and I so enjoyed brother wigam speaking
[46:25] a couple of weeks ago right I just
[46:27] really love that I really love
[46:32] that I I honestly think that's the best
[46:35] I've ever heard you by the way I'm now I
[46:38] was listening to you in a tree stand so
[46:40] it was a different
[46:46] anointing so so I listen to you and
[46:50] Andrew and brother Tim PR so I had a
[46:52] good day that I don't know if that tree
[46:55] Stan has ever felt that kind of an Anin
[46:57] in but
[46:58] it it had it that day and so amen we had
[47:03] a wonderful time
[47:05] and I was given a guide this year that
[47:09] was very special he's in 70 years old
[47:12] and I met a second Bill
[47:16] HL and he was so he was such a what he
[47:20] was Bill
[47:22] hle and uh he had been a preacher in his
[47:26] time
[47:27] he had wrote the national
[47:30] wildlife uh uh
[47:32] deer and uh magazine had wrote it for
[47:36] years and I know a lot of you probably
[47:38] picked that magazine up through the
[47:40] years of of deer hunting and and those
[47:44] those wonderful stories and those
[47:45] pictures and and he was the owner of
[47:48] that magazine and so uh and so we we got
[47:53] the opportunity to spend some time with
[47:55] him he knew anybody that was anybody in
[47:58] the in the hunting industry Matthew help
[48:00] me with his name of his
[48:04] magazine North American white tail
[48:07] Association so so we we had a wonderful
[48:11] time and and he had an
[48:14] astrop physicist
[48:17] degree you're talking about
[48:20] sharp he was just a brain from his waist
[48:23] up and
[48:24] so and so we I I just have to be honest
[48:28] with you I I just I just really enjoyed
[48:31] being with him and he was he had a 48th
[48:36] anniversary uh with his wife and we were
[48:39] in the tree stand
[48:41] together and so I had a little bit of an
[48:44] emergency situation go on with my sugar
[48:47] and so I had to get him to take me to
[48:49] the farm assistant and I asked him I
[48:52] said Don are you going to call your wife
[48:55] on your anniversary he said yes it might
[48:57] be a good
[48:59] idea you
[49:05] think and so one of her first words was
[49:09] did somebody remind you
[49:13] [Music]
[49:14] Don but we had a wonderful time together
[49:17] and uh I've invited him to come and and
[49:20] spend a little time with us and I'd like
[49:22] for you guys to meet him especially all
[49:24] you Hunters sitting here he could tell
[49:27] you about the third eye and the deers
[49:29] and how that they have a
[49:31] 300° angle to where they can see you
[49:34] even when they said they can see better
[49:35] with their head on the ground than they
[49:37] can when it it up and so that's where
[49:39] that third eye works Samuel you'll like
[49:41] that so he said if you want to move he
[49:44] said move when their head's away from
[49:45] you so so there you go that's your tip
[49:47] for the
[49:49] day and so we had a wonderful time we
[49:52] God blessed us with a with a beautiful
[49:55] beautiful deer and we were able to come

[56:23] this morning thank you for putting up
[56:24] with me for a moment there to to make
[56:26] those announcements if you will stand
[56:28] with me at Hebrews chapter
[56:35] 11 Hebrews chap 11 and verse
[56:45] 1 I want to speak to you this morning
[56:48] and we're in a precious season even now
[56:51] on the season of
[56:54] Supernatural and
[56:57] this is more than just for a 2,000 year
[56:59] ago text but you're the people that are
[57:02] in the season of
[57:05] Supernatural
[57:08] amen Hebrews 11 and verse
[57:12] 1 now Faith is the
[57:14] substance of things hoped
[57:18] for the evidence of Things Not
[57:22] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[57:25] good
[57:26] report and through faith we understand
[57:30] that the worlds were framed by the word
[57:34] of God so that things which are seen
[57:37] were not made of things which do appear
[57:42] maybe you have a need on your heart You'
[57:44] just like to lift before the Lord amen
[57:48] amen let's pray how many of you believe
[57:50] God can come this evening and touch your
[57:54] hearts and what your need is
[57:56] can happen before you leave the
[58:00] building I believe that I believe
[58:10] that almighty God what an awesome
[58:13] presence is in this
[58:21] building as we raise our hands before
[58:24] you we real realize that we're Defying
[58:29] Gravity and we raise it to a living
[58:32] God a God that hears and answers
[58:37] prayer every prayer that we pray you
[58:42] hear
[58:43] it now sometimes it takes a while for
[58:46] the answer to come but the moment that
[58:49] we pray the
[58:52] answer is on the way
[58:56] now father we're your
[58:58] children and we have a position as Sons
[59:01] and Daughters of
[59:02] God and I ask you now that you will
[59:05] touch our hearts and minister to
[59:09] us now father maybe our hands went up
[59:12] because of
[59:13] prodal needing to come
[59:16] home and maybe it looks like an
[59:19] impossible
[59:21] situation but
[59:23] father you're a god of
[59:28] impossibilities and I ask you that
[59:30] father that you'd come on the scene
[59:32] today and touch our hearts and minister
[59:35] to us
[59:36] today Lord we're thankful for all that
[59:39] you have done and Lord we ask you to
[59:42] give us strength even as we stand in
[59:44] this Pulpit
[59:45] today Lord we're just anxious in a lot
[59:48] of ways Lord to see your results touch
[59:52] us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[59:55] pray pray amen and amen amen God bless
[59:59] you you may be
[1:00:10] seated on the last service that I spoke
[1:00:13] to
[1:00:14] you I touched something
[1:00:17] off when Noah was standing watching two
[1:00:21] by
[1:00:22] two animals come
[1:00:26] he had preached 120
[1:00:28] years he had built an ark exactly like
[1:00:32] God told him to build it
[1:00:34] amen but when God be to call for animals
[1:00:39] in that realm to start moving toward the
[1:00:44] ark the only Arc of
[1:00:47] safety maybe others had built arcs but
[1:00:51] no animals were headed in their
[1:00:54] directions two counts
[1:00:56] two elephants two
[1:01:00] giraffes male
[1:01:03] female begin to make their move in that
[1:01:07] direction I'd like to say to you that
[1:01:09] we're in the season of kind of that kind
[1:01:12] of a
[1:01:13] moving there's a gathering that is
[1:01:16] happening our governments are changing
[1:01:19] we've watched in the last month our
[1:01:20] government changing in a direction that
[1:01:24] maybe some might think
[1:01:27] impossible but if you could look at the
[1:01:29] scriptures and look at what's going
[1:01:31] on they're they're even looking at it as
[1:01:34] as a realm of uh Messiah coming to the
[1:01:38] Earth let me just say that's a man
[1:01:41] Messiah but there is a messiah
[1:01:46] coming and we must realize that this is
[1:01:49] not some intellectual faith that we've
[1:01:51] got for the
[1:01:52] message we must realize that this is a
[1:01:55] super natural message that's right and
[1:01:58] we not everything is we can reason out
[1:02:01] or say is it's got to be this way or one
[1:02:04] plus one or not everything that we can
[1:02:07] see is is we can
[1:02:10] explain this message is
[1:02:13] Supernatural right this message is
[1:02:17] Supernatural even when you listen to
[1:02:19] brother Brandon preaches sermons like a
[1:02:23] greater than Solomon is here 23
[1:02:26] different times to different audiences
[1:02:28] or or the trial or the Seven Seals or or
[1:02:32] God hidden revealed in Simplicity every
[1:02:37] service held a supernatural element I
[1:02:41] want to lift it just to a to another
[1:02:43] level that same angels with us right
[1:02:48] right and maybe you you come to the
[1:02:50] service and and you come and you sit in
[1:02:52] the service and the service goes a
[1:02:54] couple of hours
[1:02:56] what I want you to be aware to catch the
[1:03:00] supernatural anointing of God not just
[1:03:04] here but around the
[1:03:06] world we're not a one-man Ministry we
[1:03:09] are a Ministry around the world and
[1:03:13] every Ministry has its different place
[1:03:16] we're not copying one another we're not
[1:03:18] trying to be better than one another
[1:03:20] we're a
[1:03:22] team that's right we're a family
[1:03:27] right rich or poor we're a family
[1:03:30] greatly gifted or or maybe gifted less
[1:03:33] by men's things let me just say but
[1:03:35] we're a family we're a team amen but the
[1:03:39] main thing that we want to catch is
[1:03:44] him are you with me right now I want you
[1:03:47] to understand and this is just a
[1:03:49] principle I want to speak to you
[1:03:53] on God takes
[1:03:57] something and make something out of
[1:04:03] nothing he can take
[1:04:06] nothing and make something
[1:04:10] right right so when the devil tells you
[1:04:15] you're nothing come

[1:05:21] world one time and he died at 33 and he
[1:05:24] conquered everything thing that could be
[1:05:26] conquered and when he was on the earth

[1:07:07] been given to us we don't have to beg to
[1:07:12] go we have been given the
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:22] right brother Brenham says and I love
[1:07:24] this quote and you've heard me quoted
[1:07:26] before the devil hates
[1:07:30] me and I know he hates you
[1:07:34] too and he said he's my enemy but as
[1:07:37] long as God is my
[1:07:39] friend I don't have no fear of him I
[1:07:43] just drive him WR right on back and take
[1:07:46] the word of God and move right on and
[1:07:48] back of he said out of his place that he
[1:07:51] thinks he's holding he hasn't got no
[1:07:54] strongholds he has absolutely legally
[1:07:57] defeated in every
[1:07:59] place I like this the devil hasn't got
[1:08:02] one legal right
[1:08:10] nowhere brother Ron our home we have
[1:08:13] such difficulty cast him
[1:08:17] out he battles my mind cast him
[1:08:21] out are you with me we're not some
[1:08:24] intellectual group Andy trying to think
[1:08:25] our way through it you have been born
[1:08:28] with the seed of God on the inside of
[1:08:31] you that has been quickened to
[1:08:34] life and it's a supernatural
[1:08:38] power I want you to just think about
[1:08:41] this first of all a word is a thought
[1:08:48] right and then it's spoken and it
[1:08:51] becomes a
[1:08:52] word and listen after it's spoken
[1:08:56] it has power to
[1:09:00] it are you with me now after it's spoken
[1:09:05] it has power to it and it has an effect
[1:09:09] to it and it has results to
[1:09:13] it are you with me I'm going somewhere
[1:09:15] with these
[1:09:16] thoughts because of who you
[1:09:21] are other people may say the same thing
[1:09:26] that you are saying quoting the same
[1:09:29] scriptures that you are quoting but Sam
[1:09:32] because of who you
[1:09:36] are you have a more Authority than the
[1:09:39] angels that are in
[1:09:43] heaven you have been given more than
[1:09:46] just power you have been given
[1:09:50] Authority brother Ron but I want Power
[1:09:53] listen if you've got author
[1:09:56] it expresses
[1:10:00] [Applause]
[1:10:05] power now let me just tell you
[1:10:09] this you are a representative and an
[1:10:13] ambassador of this
[1:10:17] message Lord people on your
[1:10:20] job people in your community may never
[1:10:24] hear a tape
[1:10:28] they may never read a
[1:10:30] book but they see the message
[1:10:34] interpreted in your
[1:10:37] life because the inspired word came to
[1:10:41] the inspired
[1:10:43] seat and listen Maybe the same message
[1:10:47] came to them but it didn't Inspire
[1:10:49] anything there but you heard it and
[1:10:54] immediately that seed said that's the
[1:10:59] truth and maybe you couldn't even
[1:11:03] understand why did it come to life in
[1:11:06] you and it didn't come to life in this
[1:11:11] individual but because he placed
[1:11:13] something
[1:11:15] there listen no man can place that seed
[1:11:18] there God placed that seed on the inside
[1:11:23] of you when before the found of the
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:33] world we are
[1:11:36] here this is our
[1:11:38] moment this is our
[1:11:40] time to
[1:11:43] declare the new
[1:11:48] creation did you catch
[1:11:50] that this message makes you a new
[1:11:54] creation
[1:11:57] you
[1:11:58] Lord we were together Friday
[1:12:02] evening and I thought about people that
[1:12:04] were assembled
[1:12:08] together maybe I'll call a couple of
[1:12:10] names here there's
[1:12:13] Josh a former
[1:12:16] biker there's Denny a former wrestler
[1:12:25] there's William a former
[1:12:44] Angel but let me Express this to you we
[1:12:47] all had a history
[1:12:50] right well brother Ron I wasn't nothing
[1:12:53] bad really
[1:12:55] you
[1:12:59] inherited you inherited by your natural
[1:13:03] birth things that you were guilty for
[1:13:06] right we announced brother Ben and
[1:13:09] sister Rebecca's baby already while in
[1:13:12] the womb sins of their forefathers are
[1:13:15] headed in the
[1:13:17] direction they won't teach that child to
[1:13:20] lie they won't teach that child to cheat
[1:13:24] they won't teach that child to do wrong
[1:13:27] right but it's in the inherited nature
[1:13:30] so God had a
[1:13:33] fix he had a fix for that and a secret
[1:13:37] believer came to him at
[1:13:39] night and Jesus told him you must be
[1:13:44] born
[1:13:46] again so I want to say to you you are
[1:13:49] here to express the new creation
[1:13:52] [Applause]
[1:13:58] now sometimes we get the idea this is
[1:14:01] just a you know this is just temporary
[1:14:03] thing or this is just a phase that we're
[1:14:05] going through this is just churchianity
[1:14:08] I'm just going to try this a little
[1:14:10] while but if you've got a seed inside of
[1:14:12] you you
[1:14:14] realize that you are as Eternal as God
[1:14:17] is
[1:14:20] eternal there's no end to this right
[1:14:24] it's only going to get
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:28] better sir it's only going to get better
[1:14:32] but brother Ron but I'm getting older
[1:14:34] and my body's falling apart maybe I'm
[1:14:37] going to a nursing home it's only going
[1:14:39] to get
[1:14:41] better don't look at the
[1:14:44] temporary don't look at what the doctor
[1:14:47] say you keep your eyes on it's going to
[1:14:50] get better sir

[1:15:15] mess that's right that that sentence C
[1:15:18] caus emotions no Miracles without a
[1:15:22] mess there's no ice coming open that was
[1:15:26] blind without a long time of
[1:15:29] blindness deaf ears coming open without
[1:15:32] a great season of of or even a a womb
[1:15:36] that couldn't have children and listen
[1:15:38] there was quite a long time
[1:15:40] maybe Sarah was
[1:15:45] childless are you with me yes sir how
[1:15:48] many headaches did you go
[1:15:50] through and you suffered great great
[1:15:53] despair
[1:15:56] you go through hard seasons of your life
[1:16:00] Ms you went through hard
[1:16:02] Seasons but there came a time to where
[1:16:05] it could you could say the curse is
[1:16:12] over sometimes we think well this is
[1:16:14] just a season this is just a difficult
[1:16:17] season Abraham when he was
[1:16:21] childless when he was childless and in
[1:16:24] it if in his in his physical being he
[1:16:27] laughed at
[1:16:29] God but God brought him out before the
[1:16:34] sand and ask him can you count
[1:16:41] them can you count
[1:16:44] them this is God talking to him right
[1:16:47] this isn't the mayor of the city right
[1:16:51] this isn't somebody want to just make
[1:16:53] him feel good
[1:16:56] so shall thy seed be
[1:16:59] amen now let me explain something to you
[1:17:02] God wasn't looking at Sand he had a book
[1:17:06] yes sir he already had their
[1:17:09] picture listen with God it's not an
[1:17:15] if I hope I can drive this to you with
[1:17:19] God it's not an
[1:17:21] if it's not an if I can stimulate you
[1:17:25] excite you to get you the
[1:17:30] point it's not an
[1:17:34] if so it's not if you can make
[1:17:39] it that ought to make you hand off hang
[1:17:41] off these chandeliers we're not here to
[1:17:45] if we can make it we're going to make it
[1:18:06] brother Brandon would use a term very
[1:18:08] early in his ministry and he called it
[1:18:11] the
[1:18:12] Deep calling to the
[1:18:17] deep and he said there's got to be a
[1:18:20] deep to respond to
[1:18:23] it sometime people go
[1:18:27] well I've went too
[1:18:31] far does he still
[1:18:35] pull does he still pull on
[1:18:39] you sister Melissa did he still
[1:18:50] pull brother
[1:18:52] Lawrence I'm looking for you
[1:18:56] brother Lawrence was gone for a long
[1:18:59] time and he said he was the delivery
[1:19:01] truck I I don't know how to explain this
[1:19:03] but he was a delivery truck driver and
[1:19:05] he would drive by this place and he said
[1:19:08] every time I drove
[1:19:10] by something pulled me up on this
[1:19:15] hill let me just say it's not it's not
[1:19:18] up to where you're hanging on or where
[1:19:20] you're trying to get yourself back come
[1:19:23] on I'm preaching to you now come on
[1:19:27] listen to you God's not in the
[1:19:29] game he's not in the game to lose
[1:19:32] Chester that's
[1:19:35] right if you were once your his seed
[1:19:38] you're
[1:19:39] always his
[1:19:44] seed get that brother Tom did you get
[1:19:47] that if you were ever his
[1:19:51] seed if you were ever his seed you're
[1:19:55] always his
[1:20:03] seed brother BR would make a statement
[1:20:06] he says before there was a fin on a
[1:20:09] fish's back there had to be water first
[1:20:14] for him to swim in that's
[1:20:16] right he done never had a fin if there
[1:20:20] was no water brother onon that's so
[1:20:23] simple
[1:20:26] so when God put a thirst inside of
[1:20:29] you he had a thirst to respond to
[1:20:38] it he had a Memphis girl that was
[1:20:42] blind and he had a
[1:20:45] fix he had a blind man in
[1:20:48] Bombay and he had a
[1:20:50] fix there was a woman in Mexico carrying
[1:20:53] a dead baby
[1:20:55] and he had a fix are you getting the
[1:20:58] point had he right had two sons and he
[1:21:01] had a
[1:21:03] fix you rais your hand before we started
[1:21:06] preaching God's got to
[1:21:16] fix now I want to tie some things
[1:21:19] together in Luke chap 1 verse
[1:21:23] 26 and the six month the angel Gabriel
[1:21:26] was sent from God into the city of
[1:21:27] Galilee named La Nazareth to a virgin
[1:21:32] ESP spouse to a man whose name was
[1:21:34] Joseph the House of David and the
[1:21:37] virgin's name was
[1:21:40] Mary God didn't search through the city
[1:21:42] to find her he knew exactly where she
[1:21:44] was
[1:21:45] at and he didn't go to a dozen dozen
[1:21:48] virgins he went to the
[1:21:53] one when it's a supernatural gospel he
[1:21:57] searches you
[1:22:04] out why are you preaching that so strong
[1:22:07] to help you with your struggle with
[1:22:13] Humanity because Humanity will make you
[1:22:16] want to give
[1:22:17] up Humanity will make you want to
[1:22:20] struggle Humanity will ask every
[1:22:23] question of why that there can be but if
[1:22:26] you can look through what God
[1:22:30] sees it will settle it
[1:22:33] forever because if God ever saw you here
[1:22:37] he'll see you
[1:22:40] there and there's already a seat at the
[1:22:43] marriage supper of the lamb for
[1:22:46] you he's just got to get you there
[1:22:55] are you with me now it's already there
[1:22:58] don't worry they're not going to be
[1:23:00] sitting extra seats it's already there
[1:23:03] for you amen he's already got a place
[1:23:07] prepared for you in the new
[1:23:15] city we get so upset about our politics
[1:23:18] here I love that sermon last night I
[1:23:21] love that last
[1:23:22] night we got a
[1:23:25] Kingdom
[1:23:28] coming that's not going to have a
[1:23:34] hospital it's not going to have a war
[1:23:40] department it's not going to have a
[1:23:42] police
[1:23:46] station it's going to be
[1:23:50] peace peace and brother brandham said he
[1:23:54] he's got your place there future home he
[1:23:57] said in every property the River of Life
[1:24:02] flows through
[1:24:04] it and he's made it just to your
[1:24:09] liking and you don't even know what you
[1:24:13] like brother Ron I know exactly what I
[1:24:16] like well why do you keep painting your
[1:24:18] house
[1:24:20] rooms come on come on now if you really
[1:24:23] knew what you liked you'd have built one
[1:24:28] house you'd have painted it the color
[1:24:30] that you wanted it you'd have did it all
[1:24:33] right but every one of us build a house
[1:24:35] and then when we're done we
[1:24:37] went I wish I'd built a cupboard
[1:24:43] bigger I you know I I wish i' kept I
[1:24:47] wish I'd have painted that light blue I
[1:24:49] wish i' have painted that
[1:24:53] beige God don't go to 100 women he goes
[1:24:56] to
[1:24:58] one now how do we
[1:25:02] believe the testimony of a teenage
[1:25:06] girl so many people criticize brother
[1:25:09] brandham and they want 50 60 years ago
[1:25:12] they want to they want to criticize and
[1:25:13] blog and do all different kind of thing
[1:25:16] listen let's go back 2,000 years
[1:25:19] ago to a teenage girl
[1:25:24] and God stops her an angel comes to
[1:25:28] her an angel comes and speaks to her
[1:25:31] look at these girls sitting here and an
[1:25:33] angel comes and speaks to her there
[1:25:36] isn't a hundred Witnesses with
[1:25:40] them and after this visit she's
[1:25:46] pregnant Hey listen folks she meets the
[1:25:50] angel the angel gives her the commission
[1:25:56] am she doesn't have a a 2hour
[1:26:04] sermon she just accepts
[1:26:07] it she just accepts it she doesn't
[1:26:11] decipher it go home and have to run it
[1:26:15] through the computer and see if it'll be
[1:26:17] all right she just accepts
[1:26:21] it I believe that's your truth
[1:26:24] listen folks she left the meeting with
[1:26:27] the angel
[1:26:32] pregnant she never felt nothing that's
[1:26:36] right you talking about a supernatural
[1:26:40] birth it wasn't part Mary and part God
[1:26:45] it was all
[1:26:49] God God only needed to borrow her
[1:26:52] womb right amen you can build every
[1:26:56] statue in the world and we've got
[1:26:57] incredible reverence for Mary what
[1:27:00] pressure that was upon on her but she's
[1:27:02] not
[1:27:03] God but what came out of her womb was
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:17] God and I want to just draw that just
[1:27:19] for a moment if you only are looking at
[1:27:22] you you'll get disappointed OED if
[1:27:25] you're only looking at other people in
[1:27:27] the church you'll get disappointed right
[1:27:30] but if you can look beyond what you
[1:27:33] see and see that Supernatural seed that
[1:27:37] is on the inside of that you're going to
[1:27:39] spend etern
[1:27:54] knows these words and when she saw him
[1:27:57] she was troubled at his saying and cast
[1:28:00] in her mind what manner of salutation
[1:28:03] this should
[1:28:05] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:28:08] Mary for thou has found favor with God
[1:28:12] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[1:28:15] womb and bring forth a
[1:28:17] son and shall call his name Jesus
[1:28:25] here's the important words and he shall
[1:28:27] be
[1:28:28] great and shall be called the son of the
[1:28:31] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[1:28:34] him the Throne of his father David and
[1:28:37] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:28:40] forever and of his
[1:28:42] kingdom there shall be no
[1:28:45] end and then M and then said Mary unto
[1:28:49] the
[1:28:49] angel how shall this be seeing I know
[1:28:52] not a man
[1:28:54] and the angel answered and said unto her
[1:28:57] the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and
[1:29:01] the power of the highest shall
[1:29:03] overshadow thee and therefore also the
[1:29:06] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[1:29:10] shall be
[1:29:11] called The Son of
[1:29:17] God
[1:29:22] prophecy every
[1:29:24] Prophet had a part of God in
[1:29:27] them Moses had a part Joseph had a part
[1:29:32] Noah had a
[1:29:34] part listen let me say it like this so
[1:29:37] you'll get it there were times that you
[1:29:39] saw God in Noah and then there was times
[1:29:42] you saw
[1:29:45] Noah there were times that you saw God
[1:29:48] in Abraham then there was times you saw
[1:29:51] Abraham there was times that you saw God
[1:29:54] in Moses and then there was times that
[1:29:57] you saw
[1:29:59] Moses there's times that you see God and
[1:30:02] Zach and then there's times that you see
[1:30:07] God or
[1:30:10] Zach is that
[1:30:14] fair there's times you see God in
[1:30:16] Brenda and then there's times you see
[1:30:20] Brenda I'm not going to you sister
[1:30:22] Connie
[1:30:25] I've learned I need to
[1:30:32] live are we are we are we there amen so
[1:30:36] it's
[1:30:39] supernatural Isaiah 7
[1:30:43] verse4 therefore the Lord himself shall
[1:30:46] give you a
[1:30:50] sign behold of Virgin shall conceive
[1:30:55] and shall bear a son and thou shalt call
[1:30:57] his name

[1:31:01] moment you brother Ron I've heard that a
[1:31:04] thousand times
[1:31:07] good can you imagine being
[1:31:10] Isaiah and Isaiah has felt the anointing
[1:31:13] of God like never before and those words
[1:31:17] slip out of his
[1:31:20] lips and now he can't explain it all I
[1:31:23] know it was God but they have slipped
[1:31:26] out of his lips Behold a virgin shall
[1:31:28] conceive it's
[1:31:31] impossible how are you going to think
[1:31:33] that one out Isaiah all I know was I
[1:31:36] felt such an
[1:31:39] anointing I felt such an anointing
[1:31:42] passed through me and he spoke through
[1:31:44] me can you imagine the blocks of that
[1:31:50] day can you imagine the scoffers of that
[1:31:53] day 10 20 years 30 40 50 60 70 years

[1:32:41] brother
[1:32:42] Ben the Rapture could not happen till
[1:32:46] every
[1:32:48] seed and I'm not just talking about you
[1:32:50] I'm talking about that little beautiful
[1:32:52] girl sitting beside of you
[1:32:58] God's not a man in his
[1:33:03] thoughts this is a
[1:33:07] Supernatural Supernatural
[1:33:10] message now God says in Genesis chapter
[1:33:14] 3 and verse
[1:33:19] 15 now he's going to talk about you said
[1:33:21] this last night Two Worlds
[1:33:24] I will put
[1:33:26] enmity between
[1:33:29] thee and the
[1:33:31] woman and between thy
[1:33:33] seed and her
[1:33:36] seed
[1:33:37] listen there in the garden to where only
[1:33:41] moments ago was
[1:33:47] perfect no leaves fell off the trees no
[1:33:52] animals died there was not a predator
[1:33:58] there no conceptions were taking
[1:34:03] place not a sin happened until
[1:34:08] today and now God is declaring a war on
[1:34:12] the
[1:34:13] devil I'm going to put enmity between
[1:34:16] the
[1:34:18] Saints between the seeds of darkness and
[1:34:21] the seeds of light Hallelujah
[1:34:24] listen Church you will never feel at
[1:34:27] home
[1:34:29] here that's right I want to say you will
[1:34:32] never feel comfortable in this world
[1:34:36] this is not your
[1:34:39] world you will Express dominion over it
[1:34:42] while you're here and keep the devil
[1:34:44] under your feet but this is not our home
[1:34:50] [Applause]
[1:35:02] I'm coming to
[1:35:06] it I want you to think about it just for
[1:35:09] a few things and I'll I'll touch on this
[1:35:11] in a couple of
[1:35:19] weeks Joseph had to have a supernatural
[1:35:21] visitation
[1:35:24] to take care of
[1:35:26] her let's just be very honest God not
[1:35:29] only has to speak to Mary but he has to
[1:35:32] speak to
[1:35:33] Joseph that's right then the first time
[1:35:38] she calls Jesus's
[1:35:40] name let's just think about how
[1:35:44] powerful something is made from
[1:35:47] nothing we talk about haty right and
[1:35:50] those two
[1:35:51] boys what about a death baby right right
[1:35:56] what we're talking about different
[1:35:58] medical conditions in those days right
[1:36:01] you just don't run to the doctor right
[1:36:04] you have a problem she's carrying a dead
[1:36:06] baby but in that time they had to wait
[1:36:09] till the the conception would take place
[1:36:12] and the baby would be born knowing it
[1:36:15] was dead all the
[1:36:16] way how heartbreaking that would be the
[1:36:21] difficulty in that home carry and after
[1:36:24] all these years finally having a baby in
[1:36:27] a womb and that baby's
[1:36:29] dead they prayed for it they prayed for
[1:36:32] it they prayed for him preaching to
[1:36:36] you and she gets a
[1:36:38] visit from Mary and she tells of this
[1:36:43] Supernatural message that she stepped
[1:36:47] into and the power of the message when
[1:36:50] she calls his name Jesus amen the angel
[1:36:54] said his name Shall be Called
[1:36:57] Jesus and in the
[1:37:00] moment of thought to
[1:37:03] word to
[1:37:08] results the same let there
[1:37:11] be that said let there be a sun Let
[1:37:14] There Be
[1:37:16] moons that same power came through her
[1:37:20] lips and spontaneously
[1:37:24] a baby begin to
[1:37:27] LEAP let's just say it how it is a
[1:37:31] prophet got the Holy
[1:37:35] Ghost in his mother's womb
[1:37:38] [Applause]
[1:37:56] do you
[1:37:57] believe you know sometimes it's great
[1:38:00] difficulty when it comes now to
[1:38:03] individuals we can ask a
[1:38:05] congregation do you
[1:38:09] believe you know a couple hundred people
[1:38:11] they go we believe brother Ron but all
[1:38:15] of a sudden it becomes
[1:38:16] you on and it's you going to get
[1:38:20] water it's you on your way to carry
[1:38:23] water to the whiskey
[1:38:27] skill it's you meeting
[1:38:30] angels in
[1:38:34] Arizona you're confronted with the
[1:38:37] message and maybe you just got a
[1:38:44] book I us with brother bisco one
[1:38:47] time brother bisco met a man at a fuel
[1:38:52] station two stories let me let me tell
[1:38:55] the one that that I'm 100% sure on a man
[1:38:58] is shining
[1:39:01] shoes brother bisc was having his shoes
[1:39:04] shine and he looked down and there's a
[1:39:06] message book laying there and he said
[1:39:09] where'd you get the book he said I got
[1:39:11] it out of the
[1:39:13] trash and he said I wish I I wish I
[1:39:16] could get more of these
[1:39:19] books he didn't know he was preaching he
[1:39:21] was shining his shoes of one of the
[1:39:24] greatest preachers that ever
[1:39:26] lived that had been in the car with the
[1:39:29] angel of the
[1:39:30] Lord and he said I got that out of the
[1:39:34] trash listen God's
[1:39:36] seed will find its
[1:39:46] place sister
[1:39:49] Gabrielle one one time I came to service
[1:39:54] I was in my
[1:39:56] office and the Lord spoke to me and he
[1:39:58] said today is Wesley's day I'll come to
[1:40:02] your I'm coming to their
[1:40:05] house he couldn't
[1:40:07] walk he's not quite old enough to
[1:40:10] understand all this now
[1:40:12] but that was a generational situation he
[1:40:15] couldn't walk if left in that condition
[1:40:18] you he'd been a wheelchair
[1:40:20] today we know that but it's not
[1:40:24] if but that
[1:40:26] service changed Wesley's
[1:40:32] life that service changed Wesley's
[1:40:36] life brother Roger how many years ago
[1:40:39] was it Billy
[1:40:40] Andrews would you just give a guess 20
[1:40:42] some
[1:40:46] years that's that's 23 years
[1:40:51] ago brother Billy Andrews is
[1:40:53] backwards and forwards across this pull
[1:40:56] pit he was praying for sister Hoover at
[1:40:59] the time how many remember Sister
[1:41:01] Hoover sister Hoover would have a stroke
[1:41:04] later and lay in the nursing home for
[1:41:06] nine
[1:41:08] years and he was praying for sister
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:13] Hoover and he turns to you brother Roger
[1:41:16] we had pews at the time and you were
[1:41:18] sitting about where brother Jeremy is
[1:41:20] sitting and he said there's a pillar of
[1:41:22] fire over top of you
[1:41:23] and you'll need God before the night's
[1:41:25] over a that right and brother Roger's
[1:41:29] heart exploded that
[1:41:31] night and he was rushed to the hospital
[1:41:34] and brother Homer and myself went to the
[1:41:36] hospital to where he was at and those
[1:41:39] doctors gave him zero
[1:41:42] hope zero
[1:41:45] hope and so his daughter Debbie that's
[1:41:48] went on to be with the Lord his W his
[1:41:50] his daughter begged and because of her
[1:41:53] position got a flight to UVA and they
[1:41:57] kept him
[1:41:58] alive on a
[1:42:00] machine seemed like it was a they called
[1:42:03] it a Ford machine or something like that
[1:42:05] and so anyway they kept him
[1:42:08] alive he's alive
[1:42:12] today he's alive today
[1:42:24] but brother Ronnie has trouble we're
[1:42:28] hum we are humans but he's
[1:42:34] [Applause]
[1:42:37] alive brother Randy's fa cancer for over
[1:42:40] a
[1:42:41] decade but he's a God that knows how to
[1:42:44] preserve
[1:42:45] you it doesn't matter what doctor say he
[1:42:48] knows how to preserve you
[1:42:53] oh
[1:42:54] amen you wanted to find a man that would
[1:42:57] love you for who you are and what you
[1:43:00] are come on but in that realm your your
[1:43:04] body is full of
[1:43:08] hair you have a perfect body there and
[1:43:12] maybe you were looking for somebody that
[1:43:14] would overlook your
[1:43:16] imperfections but God don't look at your
[1:43:19] imperfection
[1:43:21] amen he don't look at your imperfection
[1:43:24] he looks at what he
[1:43:30] sees so while the songs were going on
[1:43:33] last
[1:43:38] night the Lord spoke to
[1:43:41] me where's your
[1:43:44] sister could she
[1:43:47] come come baby

[1:44:37] burned until it was burned to where I
[1:44:39] had no skin and was burned to the
[1:44:46] meat and they never thought it would
[1:44:49] maybe ever grow
[1:44:51] back so they took skin from my
[1:44:54] legs and they begin to patch it over
[1:44:58] hoping it would
[1:45:00] take you know what they told me I asked
[1:45:02] them I said why didn't you do it earlier
