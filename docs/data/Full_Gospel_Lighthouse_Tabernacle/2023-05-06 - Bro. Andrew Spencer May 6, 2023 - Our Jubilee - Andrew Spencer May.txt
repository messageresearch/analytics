a very Supernatural way Lord we pray these things knowing god that you're going to do the supernatural tonight so we give ourselves over to you by the power of your word we pray these things in Jesus name amen amen if you have your Bibles this evening we'd like to look over two places in the Old Testament just in Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8 then down to Genesis chapter 18. Leviticus chapter 25. and verse 8 and the Lord has placed something upon our heart to to deal with here in the next next little bit and and we know that we're in a very special season that has Full Gospel Lighthouse this is our this is our 50th year as a church body here in the Elkton area we we started 50 years ago in 1973 and brother Bill Hinkles in his basement of his home there and and there from that there the lord gave a vision that our church would be started up here and on off of right right off of Route 33 and brother Homer had seen a vision of the the the things hanging out of the ceiling there and the Lord blessed and the Lord sent sent people that would receive a message and the church grew and from there we we moved up as a church to Summit Avenue and we turned a house and into a real church and we had Supernatural times there and and the Lord blessed and he he seemed fit to give us this building that we're in here since 1991 and the Lord has certainly blessed us here at Full Gospel White House and I know that I know that I have my sister that's going to be working on that maybe a slideshow if we can make some of those things available for us in the next in the next little bit but we just want to our minds are here our hearts are here but I would like to speak to you for a little bit on our Jubilee our Jubilee this is our 50th year and I believe that we are entering into some of the most special times as the Bride of Jesus Christ that we've ever entered into and and I just countered a privilege you know to be standing a church 50 years standing without denominational ties standing without but we're standing fully upon the message of the hour and the Lord has been our provider we didn't ask for we didn't ask for people just to fill the pews we ask for Sons and Daughters of God that would truly Worship the Lord and God has filled this building and we don't know whether time will Terry another 20 years or another five years we're going to need another building because people are hungry for the very word of God and I just say it to God God be the glory in all of these things and so we we can never say enough about our founder brother Homer Frazier and the vision to have this church here upon this hill we were they the engineers told us that we'd never be able to have a church up here but we had a vision and because a man had a vision the church is here upon this upon this Hillside and we're just thankful to be a lighthouse for these 50 years and I believe that if the Lord tarries will continue to be a lighthouse amen Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8. and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of the Year unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years and then shalt thou cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land and unto the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family also in Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9. you love the Lord this evening amen Genesis chapter 18. Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9. and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and said I will certainly return unto thee in according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I have pleasure with my Lord at being old also and the Lord said unto Abram Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying I shall I of assurity bear a child which IM old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son may God bless his word he may be seated in the presence of the Lord and from these texts tonight I would like to draw a thought on our our Jubilee our Jubilee and I think it's a very powerful thing that when you begin to study the scriptures I think it's very wonderful thing that you can recognize that Elohim is saying that I will return and to think that that this is right here before the change of Abraham and Sarah's body but they had lived such a life as such a close life to our Lord Jesus Christ and begin to Fellowship that they could have fellowship with Melchizedek they could sit down and they could enjoy his Fellowship they could feed him of the uh they could feed him of the calf of the land they could sit down and have Fellowship but because of the interaction that Abraham had had throughout all of his life with Abraham with God and Abraham having it with God and God having it with Abraham that he lived a life that was completely separated it caused a spot where Abraham could have fellowship with Melchizedek and Melchizedek could say that I am going to return unto you at the church certain time of life and to think that the god of the universe is saying unto Abraham that I'm going to return unto you and I'm going to bring Liberty to your body to the things which you couldn't do in the natural I'm going to make possible by the supernatural you see when Melchizedek shows up he's going to take the former things and he's going to make them new you see there's nothing that is too hard for our Lord when when our Lord Jesus Christ begins to show up in our lives and we watch the very physical things in our life as they begin to roll off of us because of the power of a new birth and the change of a nature and we recognize that that he will be the one that will stand there as we read in Revelations chapter 21 that he will wipe all the tears is out of off of our eyes and the former things are going to be passed away and he that set upon the throne says behold I make all things new so the one that came and touched Abraham and Sarah's life is the same exact one that has touched your life and made you new a new creature in Christ Jesus and I think it's a very wonderful thing to recognize that we are in a ear of Jubilee and it's not just necessarily for Full Gospel Lighthouse but it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ that we are in a time where we can Proclaim Liberty amongst the Church of the Living God and we recognize that that that in the time of return or in the Feast of Jubilee that there would come a time when every seven years every seven years there was a Sabbath and every seven days was a Sabbath but every seven years and stack it up together seven years at what added up to put it together it's 49 years but on the 50th year it was a a time of Jubilee and Jubilee was a time when every man that had lost his inheritance whether it be by the means of poverty or whether it be by the means of different ways of losing it through a sale or different things if that man was Freeborn if he was a Freeborn Israelite and he was Blood Bought blood bought by an Israelite that he could go back to his possession it didn't matter who had that possession whether it was a king that had that possession or whether it was just that just another spot or a squatter or another person on the land if he was an Israelite he could go back to that possession that he had owned he didn't have to pay a thing for it he didn't have to do a thing for it but he just stopped what he was doing lay down his old Treasures lay down all of his old old things lay down all of his own habitants and he would go back to his inheritance you see what it meant it was Grace unto him provided unto him that he could go back and return to his rightful inheritance it's and I I think it's a wonderful thing tonight that we recognize that it's not just a feast for Israel but it's a feast for every single one of us to recognize that when they were standing there and the priest would blow the trumpet it would send out a sound throughout all of Israel that it was a time of Jubilee and they were very certain about it they knew where they were if you were a slave master and you recognize that you had slave men underneath enslaved women underneath of durabilities that those people could go absolutely free on the day of Jubilee and there was nothing that the slave master slave master could do you see where that trumpet denoted he was assembled to every slave that no matter how long he'd been a slave whether it was one year or 49 years he could go back to his possession that had passed down to him through his mother and his father and throughout the generations of traditions that he could go back to that inheritance that was rightfully his he didn't have to work for it he didn't have to pull forward he didn't have to beg for it but everything was rightfully given back to him in the Year of Jubilee when he heard the sound of the trumpet now you know good and well that that that those men that heard that trumpet they could go free but a man that stood back there and didn't walk out and go back to his inheritance walked out in front of the priest and they bore a hole in his ear and it was a sign that he would have to stay a slave for the rest of his years but the time when the Jubilee was sounding out he was a sign that this is your chance this is your opportunity that the sound is coming forth that the spirit of the Lord is here to Proclaim Liberty upon the captives and it's a time and it's some season that we're in or a time in the moment that this is the Year of Jubilee so let me say it like this no matter how far you are in sin no matter how dark of a condition that you're in no matter how bad a hole hole that you are in you could drop what you were doing and you could walk out to your Liberties that were rightfully given you by the Son of God and it didn't matter what had or what sickness that was upon you it didn't matter what sin that was upon you you could go rightfully back to the things that were rightfully yours because you had heard a voice that you could go free I'll tell you Church of the Living God we've went through the birth pains and we recognize that this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears so I want to say to you Church Be steady God is fixing to move it doesn't matter where you are it doesn't matter how long you've been a Christian it doesn't matter what you've gone through doesn't matter where you are when you hear the sound of the trumpet of Jubilee you don't have to be uncertain about it because it's a certain sound I'll tell you what it was the voice had said to you that you don't have to work for that slave master no more you don't have to live under that complex no more you don't have to live under your false decisions and your own moves no more I'll tell you what it was the slave masters Authority had been broken by the sound of that trumpet so there was no more power behind that Taskmaster when they immediately when the Jubilee trumpet had sounded it became the authority of all the land that the power of saying of Satan's kingdom had been broken foreign I hope you hear me talking to you loud and clear tonight this is our Jubilee you don't have to wait for another Moment The Vision has spoken the vision has given us the authority to recognize that the message is right the messages are Authority the message is a call to come back you see that's exactly what the message of the hour is it's to return back to the very word of God you see William Brandon would say in the message of it is the rising of the sun he said how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the right he said but when he did everything even The Proven by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in the last days don't you don't you see that she has to return through Malachi 4. you see that's the only way that you can return back to what God intended you for was to return through the ministry of Malachi 4. you see that's exactly what the message has done it's turn our hearts back to an altar back to a praise without shackles upon our life without sin Upon Our Life to recognize who we are and what God called and destined us to be and I'll say this as it wasn't just for William Brandon the message wasn't just for William Branham the message just wasn't for the Branham family it wasn't just for the elite of so-called preachers but it's for whosoever will that God elected before the foundation of the world this message is your authority to tell Satan to take his dirty hands off of God's Property that's what this message has done it's ripped every lie and told the Devil he's false and it's told you that these are the true sayings of God let me tell you what good is it going to do if David was the only one that had the ability to kill Giants David would have been a worn out human being if he was the only one that could stand out there and sway Giants but I'll tell you what it was they'd set out there under the ministry of Saul and they got scared and they were a bunch of cowards for 40 days and they watched a little anointed boy come down off of a hill and when all of Israel had been scared and been a coward for 40 days when they watched David show up they recognize that their anointing was back they recognize that they're anointing had returned back to the camp of Israel and they watched what David did and it was a sign of him that they could do the same thing what good is it going to do to stand there and just say it was just for William branov but the same anointing under this message has given us a bride with authority to stand toe-to-toe with the devil called Maniacs what they are but call Jesus Christ Our Lord what good you're going to do brother Chris if William Branham is the only one that can lay hands upon the sick and only they recover then we're preaching a false identity of a word but if it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ it's it for whosoever will these little girls can lay their hands on you those Brothers in the back can lay their hands upon you and you watch the sick be healed what are you saying brother Andrew this is our Liberty and it's not just for Joy Bales it's not just for dancing it's not just for emotion our Liberty is back to the fullness of the word to confess that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm as good as well known that I'm an emotional human being what what good is it going to do if the message just puts us up on a bubble and it makes us shout makes us get excited but if this message has been a return back to the faith I'm telling you that every Liberty that is laying here in the word of God you are free to it come on somebody John 14 12 is for you John 15 7 is for you Hebrews 13 8 is for you I know there's a whole lot of giants in the land but William Branham ain't the only one that can kill him come on somebody I see some Charles Grimms out there I see some Lawrence signs out there that say Hey this is my mountain and we're more than able to take it come on somebody I see some Doug Bowman said some Jerry breeding and some Scotty Huffman's this is our anointing this is our Authority this is our message this is our calling you see there always was people that were skeptic that there was that there was Giants in the land and always been brought up for question where where was them Giants where was them signs at where what if there was jobs I think the Bible's just telling us something you see there's a whole lot of people that are sitting around the message today I said well where where is the sign of of his approval where's the sign of casting out Devils I'll tell you where it's at it's in the bride's body but it was always up for question whether there was real giants or not but there was a farmer in 1963 over in Israel and he was plowing up his he was plowing up his field and when he got to digging up his field he stuck his plow down in there and when he went in there he broke open a treasure Grove a Philistine weapons they knew it was Philistines weapons by the markings and how big it was these things were huge go on the end of a spear that were they were some I forget the exact but I believe are 40 pounds 40 pounds for a Spearhead but they recognize that this was the identity that Giants was in that land and I think it's amazing that it was in 1963 that they found out that there was proof that Giants were back there it was in this hour in 1963 that their Satan was exposed as who he was that he didn't have the authority to hold the bride's body no longer because she has heard her sound of freedom what was it when the seals were released those those demons were released out of the river of Euphrates two hundred thousand thousand demons but there is a weapon that is greater than anywhere Earthly foe or any demonic power the message has called us back to Sons and Daughters of God to our rightful position which Adam had sold us into slavery through the fall at the beginning there but before Adam could fall and get all of humanity in a fallen condition you and I were in the back part of God's mind before an Adam was spoken broke into existence before a molecule was rolled over you was in the back part of God's mind that God was going to let himself be expressed through his attributes that had a representation by predestination you see God knows you look at your neighbor say God knew me he knew you just like he knew the woman at the well before he ever went and sat down there he knew he was going by Samaria because the Bible said that he had need to go by there and when he went up there and was sitting on that well and was having a conversation with this woman he began to talk to her but before he ever got there William Branham said that there was a scripture that was laying down on the inside of that little girl's heart that this is exactly what the Messiah would be what was she looking at it was a purifier manifested in the bride or in our Lord Jesus Christ you see what she was looking at was exactly what she needed I'll tell you what William Branham said he said while Jesus was setting on that well he began to discern her hearts that would give her her Liberty what was it it was Hebrews 14 and 12 the word that is a sharp to which its sword what was it he went into her past he told her what was holding her back he told her what was keeping her from her from her liberties but he went all the way in her future and when she saw her future was clear in Christ Jesus she dropped her source of life and she ran into the City and said come and see a man what was it he was the return of the pillar fire that had led Moses was now in the body called Jesus Christ I say this that you are now under the return of the pillar of Fire 2000 years we look for it but now it's come and encapsulated the bride's body of Jesus Christ William Branham says a very powerful thing in the seven churches he said this age started just after the turn of the 20th century he said as it was to the age to be the age in which in which the Church the true church would return to being the bride that she was at Pentecost he said we know that there must be a necessity of a return of the dynamic power you see you see it's in this hour it's in this moment that the bride is returning back to the bride that she was all the way back there two thousand years ago in the upper room on the day of Pentecost and this message has called this bride to turn back to the faith to restore to return and just as the prodigal son who had made his return back to the father's house you you have made your return you always was a son even when you ask for your possessions even when you went out there and you spin it on every worldly thing you always was a son though he drifted from the truth though he drifted from his inheritance down on the inside of him he knew that he was a son when he was in a pog's pen he knew he was a son when he was barely making it he knew he was a son but he had a mama and daddy that knew he was a son when he was in his worst condition he had a mom and daddy that knew he was a son that knew he was a rightful heir of the Kingdom that they had and an angel came and tapped him on the shoulder and said it's time to go back home I remember when the angel came and touched me I was hit it my way but the angel turned me back Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's exactly what Christ is coming for for those that have made a return back you're enjoying his appearing but get ready he's coming you enjoy his appearing all week long but he's coming for you because you made a return Hallelujah because you wouldn't let any Earthly pressures or any Earthly foes keep you from returning back the Holy Ghost is mine the Holy Ghost is my possession this message is everything I got he is my possession this Pentecostal experience is our possession it is our inheritance what are you looking at you're looking at hearts that have turned back to the Pentecostal Dynamics let me tell you if all this message is it's just mechanics and it can't produce a very Dynamic power of Jesus Christ then we ought to put all the books on his health and leave him a prayer but if we can get our young girls and preach to them the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the message restored everything that had been robbed off of it and watch them get filled with the Holy Ghost then I believe we ought to preach it until every breath is out of our lungs the message has turned us back [Applause] see what this message is is exactly the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Paul said in First Corinthians 14 and 8 that if a trumpet give an uncertain sound who can prepare himself for battle in other words who will recognize the signal to show up so if the message is sounding out something different than what the author wrote you're not going to know when to show up but because you're here it shows that the message has a certain sound to it now I know a lot of people can't understand what it's saying but to you that know you showed up to battle you showed up when God called you sister handle you was on a run for a long time but the sound of the Gospel trumpet came by your way and you knew to show up Hallelujah you see when the trumpet when you see the trumpet of God sounding the word of God and God vindicating it with signs and wonders as he said it would be he said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound he said the chief Captain won't vindicate the call he said my brother he said that was a stomach fool he said the chief Captain won't vindicate the call for he said in Mark 16 all the world these signs shall follow them that believe that's the chief Captain he said in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with tongues Hallelujah he said that's the call the captain said I'll vindicate them by this he that believeth on me not on him not him that says he believes but he that believes on me the works that I do shall he do also so if we say we have the spirit of Christ and we don't do the works of Christ then something's wrong you all know good and well by now I'm not a carpenter only thing I can build is sermons sometimes I wonder about that but you don't want me using a hammer brother Terry took it out of my Granddaddy's hand because he wasn't a carpenter a lot of people trying to take a hammer out of my hand the only thing I'm good for is destroying things that's pretty much true yes sir but if I told you that I had the spirit of a great Carpenter on me and I went out here and all I could build you was a chicken shed that would fall over in a few days you would say that the spirit that is upon me is not the spirit of a contractor is that right if I told you I had the spirit of a mechanic uphold me and all I could do was tear down your motor but I couldn't put it back to say the spirit that I have upon me is a part of a demolition to Herbie man and I'm not the man that can put it back together but if I can say to you that I had the spirit of Christ upon me and I can't do the works of Christ then something's wrong with my confession but if I have his spirit I can lay my hands upon those that are demon possessed and I say Satan take your dirty rotten hands or for God's Property it's by his spirit it's by his might what is it it's the return of our Lord Jesus Christ in his bride's body and William Branham said the call will come right through this it'll come right through this little body see what it is it's the token life of Jesus Christ it's the literal return of Jesus Christ return back upon the believer is that right it's made its return you feel its power you feel the anointing of it we made our return just like there's a fish a fist called a salmon that every four years it begins to make a journey that's impossible you didn't know where we were going but these sisters used to live up there in Washington Washington State and they would tell us they were telling us this just this week said man whenever spring will come up through air I know salmon said to get the stinking over there they'd be just dying there's a beautiful stream right beside Mount Baker camp and those salmon would run up there you see because they were birthed in fresh water but they spend their life out there at Sea they spend their life out there at Sea and they spend thousands and thousands of miles of energies they travel 50 miles a day Upstream they can jump 10 feet in the air just to give back to their home place you see something enters a homing Instinct on the inside of those salmon that's telling them that they've got to go back there they've got to go back to their home you see they were birthed in fresh water so they got to go back to fresh water let me tell you the salt of the world can never hold me but I was born in the fresh Revival and William Branham said every generation has got its Fresh Prince fresh chance at the word of God see they knew they were going back up there to die they'd travel all their miles to go all the way back up there and just to die but it was worth it for all them eggs when they were in their spawning to give birth to the next life but you didn't return to die he returned to live Jordan Martin didn't leave everything behind him just to come here and die he brought his family into this message to live I know what it's like to be a dead sinner but I know what it's like to be alive in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I know what it was like to have the World by its tail but there ain't nobody that can do me like King Jesus how Israel get back here in her Homeland when she was brought back there on their wings of an eagle and they said to her are you returning back here just to die they said oh no we're returning back here to see our Messiah and the first time in over 2 000 years you see the six-point star of David flying the oldest flag that there is and the same night and the same night that Israel became a nation our Prophet was in a cave was in a cave and receiving his Commission to return you to return you brother Jonathan you wasn't even in the picture according to your mind but God had a prophet God had a prophet receiving a message that would turn brother Timothy right back to his inheritance come on somebody where where would Gabrielle borlavon be today if a message hadn't came by her way Hallelujah Hallelujah that's what William Branham said he's a national forest put Israel back in her Homeland he's a national forest will put the World Council of the church in the world Council of churches he said but it'll be the power of God that'll put the people back in the bride's position don't you see what this word has done it's put you right back in place oh Lord have mercy it's a good thing this thing's nailed down good I pray tear it down tonight hallelujah it's what the message says done it's returned us back I ain't afraid about so he's speaking because I know that there's a God that has made a return and somewhere more than able to take it Hallelujah I ain't scared about brother Ron's report I know we've had a return I don't care how far you are I don't care how bad you hate me I don't care how bad you hate me screaming and I don't care how bad you hate me for preaching the message as long as I'm here I'm gonna preach that you have the ability to get the same power that little Mary got come on Satan do your lunch to this message but we'll rise up higher and greater than we ever have before [Applause] Hallelujah I was birthed here I know what it's like I know what it's like the message put us in our place brother Brandon said in Jehovah Jireh he said now he said to believe the word is to receive the word and let it become life he said now God's showing here how he was confirming the Covenant he said it has to be that way the church not an organization not a denomination but the individual and God has became the same spirit and that's God's purpose in the beginning that Adam and Eve Was the Same Spirit so to believe the word is to receive the word so to believe the word is to receive the word and let it become life so you could say I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have his Spirit but you recognize that if you have his Spirit there is a promise that is connected that is carried along with the Covenant of his spirit you know that you got his Spirit right so if you've got a spirit you know that there's a promise connected to it come on somebody I'm talking to you if you've got his Spirit you know there's a promise connected to it well what is it brother Andrew it's this promise that the words that I do shall you do also so when you received his Spirit whether you're five years old or a hundred years old the words that I do shall he do also what are you operating in You're simply operating in a channel that the Holy Ghost has destined you to operate in nobody else can operate here there was a lot of people in Moses's day that tried to operate in the channel that he was destined to operate in even his mom and daddy tried to give him their own experience and tell him but you see it had to be inspired to him that he would work there and when he began to move into the channel you begin to see the same Authority that was back there in the Garden of Eden be placed right into Moses his life what was it it was the creative word that was back there in the Garden of Eden it's that creative word that was operating through a man the son of man Ministry through Moses what was it he gathered the inspiration the same Authority that was all the way back there in the Garden of Eden Moses didn't want to deliver them people I'm a message person God loves me he didn't want to deliver them well you say we're reaching I'll give you the quote for it he said Hey Brother random said and I've heard but now I see he said well he said Moses didn't want to deliver them he said but something began to post say and get into a man he began to vindicate to him and show him that these things was going to happen he didn't want to deliver those people but God spoke to him so he's up there on that mountain ain't no way I'm going back down there to them a bunch of crazy Jews down there the last thing they know about me is I'm a murderer I don't want to deliver them I'm living a good life up here he'd heard about a great Jehovah that Abraham had met but when he got up there at the pillar of fire he could say I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now I see and when he got up there inspiration struck him and he said what he was supposed to say you see Moses didn't want to do this but God Paul said it on the inside of him and he Vindicated Moses's call let me tell you there's a lot of things that you didn't want to do but when the pulsation of the Holy Ghost began to move in a service like this it makes you do things that you wouldn't necessarily do and when Moses got out there and he's got the two million Jews with him he's got them all behind him and he goes to a crisis and there's a Red Sea in front of him what does he do inspiration strikes him the same inspiration that hits him while he's back there in Egypt and he calls for fleas and he calls for flies and he calls her frogs and he goes to all and the same inspiration he didn't even know what he was saying he said stand still and see the salvation of the Lord what was he operating in he was operating in the inspiration of the channel of the Holy Ghost hey let me put it in plain language to you Hattie you don't know what you're saying you don't know what you're saying but you're saying the right thing Moses you don't know what you're saying but you're saying the right thing you may not see the waters parted yet but you're saying the right thing it's well I don't see my loved one come in yet but you're saying the right thing I don't see healing coming but you're saying the right thing you're under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and job said I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now I see you can take all of these Bibles every one of these Bibles right here in the fly leaf of my Bible I got every one of them Spencer children and every one of these Fraser children wrote down in the fly leaf of my Bibles I didn't know how Gabriel Spencer was going to get here I didn't I didn't know how Malachi Spencer would get held to where he was or charity and Michael and Alexa but I trusted the word of the Lord I didn't know how he was going to do it but I'd heard about a god they could but now I can say I see him clearly Hallelujah I just telling somebody else's stories I'm telling my story [Applause] well brother Ron's got some of the greatest stories that he could tell about miracles it ain't just about brother Ron having his story it's about you having your story I confess the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost Field me I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and he saved me you're gonna have a story to tell Lily he's the god of you he's the god of you I don't think it's going to be too hard for somebody to reach over there and lay their hands upon our brother or our sister and watch the miraculous take place we've watched tumors disappear that's not just for William Branham it's in this body we've seen cysts disappear we've seen cancers fall off what is it it's hard to believe I've seen people that said they'd never move in a service like this but because they recognize that the Trump and call it come over them they heard the sound foreign that the Bible said that forever the land is mine it can't be sold I want to tell to you Satan you have no legal Authority on the bride's body cancer you have no Authority complexes you have no Authority depression you have no Authority tumors you have no Authority sickness you have no Authority Demons of hell you have no Authority depressions and dark spirits of suicide you have no Authority homosexuality you have no Authority every dark shadow of hell has no Authority when the gospel Trump against us hounded I'm free I'm free I'm free drop your hoe run back go to your possession the Holy Ghost is mine Deliverance is mine Freedom Is Mine Worship Is Mine Praises my the message is mine [Applause] you're not a servant you're a son see those that are working in the field that are servants heard the same thing that you heard they heard the same message you heard but it didn't do nothing to them but when it come across the sun's ears I know what that sounds like what happened in 1958 when William Brandon preached the Oneness of unity he's standing there and he's you listen to him man he is battling in this service and I'm not battling I don't know why I'm here but I'm going to tell it to you anyhow but he's standing in his battling he's battling he's battling one of the greatest Supernatural events is getting that's going to transpire throughout the message is getting ready to happen but he's battling to get through this bound up crowd they won't amen the word they won't receive the word they won't preach with him he said now look he said I believe in being conservative he said but conservateness brings us superstitious superstitious spirit with it he said oh Lord I pray you sit in your spirit and loosen up this crowd he said as soon as he began to say that there came a wind through there and it sounded like pipe organs rocking the building it blew his coattail up in the air people witness I witnessed the very Supernatural power of the Holy Ghost and some of the greatest Miracles that transpired transpired it right there well I don't know if I can brother Andrew Moses knew he had access he was a prophet of the Lord he didn't even know what he was saying but because he recognized his position as a prophet he could stand there and say those things Hattie didn't know what she was saying she could have asked for a million dollars but she said the right thing she asked for her two sons if them two sons would have walked out I wouldn't be here today but when he said I give you your son's Hattie Hallelujah I give you your son's Hattie they dropped on her knees and because those two boys are a part of the third pool you're here today I'm here today too many people are afraid to the third Point think it's can't it can't be for them it is for every one of you I ain't seen no squirrels manifested I'll be honest with you I ain't asked for squirrels but I believe if I had need of them I could ask for them and they'd be in this room right now but to be honest I don't need no squirrels in here brother Thomas has greater needs than I have than squirrels come on somebody come on somebody I don't need to resurrect a little fish but I believe that I could if I needed to but my motive is in these young people motive is in your healing and I believe that I could say the right word brother Chris why can't we have it why can't we receive it if God before us brother Joel then where be all of his miracles here right here oh somebody give a witness to the holy ghost that it's in the room it's our Jubilee [Applause] what is it it was the same power that came and worked in Abraham's body that Abraham Abraham even though he was as good as his dead brother Doug he received a promise and he staggered not at the promise of God but was faithful giving praise unto the Lord what was it what was it who was he fellowshipping up there with brother Jim he was fellowshipping with Elohim he was fellowshipping with the self-existing one the same one the same one that was going to meet him 15 years from this moment and meet him up on Mount Moriah and he would not just be Elohim but he would be Jehovah Jireh he would be his provider he was fellowshipping with him and the one that made the deposit was good enough to take care of Isaac in the future what are you fellowshipping with you're not fellowshipping with me you're not just fellowshipping with my thoughts you are fellowshipping with the mind of God what's making you believe that all things are possible you're fellowshipping with an Angel only certain people know this but I'm going to tell it right now because I feel the same one standing here but about a month and a half ago I was standing on that little platform and I stood there and I said that El Shadi I has made a deposit unto Abraham you probably remember I turned around and I saw an angel standing right there I saw an angel standing right there what was he saying to you that the angel has made a deposit the seventh angel has made a deposit to the bride's body that you cannot fail the first he fell but this eve cannot fail because she's predestinated not to you can't go down in destruction you can't go down in defeat the angel has said you're going to be there who is this who is this Melchizedek I say it's none other than our Lord Jesus Christ it was the same one that Abraham was fellowshipping with he was the same one that William Branham was fellowshipping with it's the same one that you feel in the room right now don't you feel it brother Timmy you feel it in the room you feel the reaction and your amen has brought into where your need is and I don't know what you're facing in your life but I believe that this is your Liberty that the angel is here to prove himself that he's still able to do the exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in US thank you [Applause] what was it Paul tapped into a in the book of Ephesians he tapped in and paralleled it all the way back there in the Book of Joshua that when William Branham comes and he preached the Feast of the trumpet he comes there and he's trying to preach it but the angel tells him this is for the Jews but he comes and preached the Feast of the trumpet and what does William Branham do in that message he lays out all the boundaries for the Bride of Jesus Christ saying this is your Authority this is your possession this is yours and what did Paul say in Ephesians chapter 1 that he predestinated us under the adoptions of sons so this is not the hour of hoping that it will be but this is the hour of manifested Sons and Daughters of God you're not a servant you're not a Slave because a servant of God is not in the house forever but the son does because the Jesus would go on to say that whom the son is set free it's free indeed you see when they heard the sound they heard the sound they knew they were free they knew they were free they knew they were free what did William Bradham do when he's standing there he's preaching a very powerful message on birth veins how this world has went through all of these birth pains and it's it's going through these things and he's getting ready and you remember the story and he's standing there and he's got his wife's just given a new Bible and he's trying to find the scripture where the woman's in travail going through these birth pains and a priest comes over and hands him his Bible his Bible and says Be steady son God is fixing to move what was it William Branham comes right back after that and preaches to us this day this scripture is fulfilled that the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he hath anointed me to preach to those that are in captives that they are set free to bind up the Brokenhearted so what is this you are under an anointing to say that this is your Liberty what is the message brother Angel it's your Liberty what is the third pull it's your Liberty what is this message it's the opening of the word oh Hallelujah let me shout it from the tops of my lungs go free go free God free go free what happened in high school what transpired in college the complexes that were stacked up you're free from them Satan has no power over you in the name of Jesus Christ the authority of the word and says you're healed says you're delivered says you're made whole [Applause] glory to God that's a big guy right there and I was never dumb enough to fight him I got all the ice cream he got all the steak containers it's starting to catch up to me too ice cream's catching up if I'm going to have a weakness that's a weakness I have but as strong as that guy was he could never keep me from this it was a time in my life I needed a strong man like him I need a strong man from him like him I was on my way from running away from this message and running away from this truth run away from my family bags packed baby I'm gone I was in a real spot yeah I live the best of lives I lived in a preacher's home heard the message every day but hell has a slick way of getting to you I was on my way out in a strong hand said no no sir somebody grabbed me by the back of my neck flipped me upside down said you're staying here but on the streets of Victoria somebody greater than that guy grabbed a hold of me and say you're staying right here this is your field Ruth you got confidence in Boaz this is your confidence stay right here and there's more demon powers that have tried to keep you from this message and trying to keep you from the truth but God rich in his Mercy said stay right here stay right here you're not going nowhere this is yours this is your inheritance you know what it's like to be in a spot where you barely live in but now you know what it's like to be in a spot of feast your Liberty is here the land is mine brother says when he's talking to the angel and the angels showing him the vision of the 30 pulls you remember William Branham got in trouble and I'm closing I'm closing put your sweater on grab your bag I'm closing you remember he got in trouble we're showing all those Pentecostal preachers up here on the bank how to fish he was telling them how the gift operated but he told him he said you can't teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural things you can't teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural things let me tell you you can try with all your mind to teach them the Supernatural and they'll never receive it but what they need is this third pole but what did he get when he made that third pull he got the greatest fish he got the rainbow trout he got a covenant people when he made the third poll he got you he got you and then when he begins to tell this when he begins to tell this in 1964 64 in his unfailing words of Promise he begins to talk about a woman by the name of Hattie Walzem that was there in Phoenix that was sitting there and had cancer of the heart and cancer throughout her body she's told her husband said even if I die right here in the prayer line you send me on through there brother random said I didn't even know what I was doing he said I walked out there and he said I laid my hands upon that dead corpse and she came back to life what was operating in the early Ministry of William Branham was the inspiration of the third pool what was Abraham tapping into it was a third poll to change his body what is this Jubilee it's your Liberty to take a body change it's your Liberty to tell Satan take your dirty hands off of God's Property I once was his property I once was held by him but not no more I have been seen on the other side marching to the steps Onward Christian Soldiers marching as to war it's my year a jubilee come on stand with me Give the Lord a hand clap of Praise I've been loose from the grip of Satan I've been set free from the group of Satan he has no hold on me sickness has no hold on me chains have no hold on me thank you your Liberty is here it's not just good enough to go through all of your confessions and go through all your mistakes this woman had all kinds of mistakes this woman at the well had all kinds of mistakes that was laying there on the surface failures on top of failures but Jesus was looking past the surface and it seemed that she had predestination written all over her life you got scars he got complexes all over your life you keep going through it God forgive me God forgive me God forgive me God forgive me but sometimes you're going to have to scream out God deliver me to live for me she done had six but he was getting ready to be number seven everything was laying there on the surface for her but he went beyond the surface and he brought her her Liberty that she would leave everything that she knew how did Devin get here he had need to go by Elton he had need to go by Elton your scars wasn't big enough to keep Jesus away from you your complexes wasn't big enough to keep Jesus away from you and we see the predestination of the moment that you're in because we see the fruits of the spirit that's upon your life your little daughter's getting ready to take on the same name that you took on Hallelujah what was this message to Devon it was her Liberty that was no hope for her outside of
