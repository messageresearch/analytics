[38:28] good old gospel ship. I'm going far
[38:32] beyond the sky.

[43:03] He's holy.
[43:05] He's awesome.
[43:09] Oh yes, he's awesome. Somebody say my
[43:13] deliverer.
[43:14] Deliverer.
[43:17] Deliverer.
[43:19] Deliverer.
[43:22] My God is awome.
[43:26] Oh yes. He's awome.
[43:31] My God is awome.
[43:36] Oh, he's awesome.
[43:41] He's awome.
[43:46] He's awome.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[43:52] we come before you, Father, realizing,
[43:55] Lord Jesus, how great and how marvelous
[43:58] are thy ways.
[44:00] How wonderful are thy truths, Lord, for
[44:03] they are marrow to our bones, Lord. They
[44:07] energize our spirit, Father. Quicken our
[44:10] soul, make us alive, make us new. And
[44:14] Father, you've
[44:16] uh granted us the opportunity, Lord
[44:18] Jesus, to one more time hear thy word,
[44:22] to receive all the many blessings,
[44:24] Father, that you have given to us so
[44:27] freely. And we desire, Lord Jesus, today
[44:30] to come before you, Father, with
[44:33] thanksgiving and praise upon our lips.
[44:35] We desire, Lord Jesus, that you would
[44:37] just minister to us, Lord. We're your
[44:40] children. And Father, when we don't know
[44:43] what to do sometimes, the greatest thing
[44:45] that we can do is just stop and thank
[44:47] you and praise you, Father. We pray
[44:49] today from our lips, from our soul, from
[44:52] our innermost being, Father, that there
[44:55] would be such a bubbling up of joy on
[44:57] the inside of our hearts.
[45:00] Father, that your great condescending
[45:03] power would condescend upon your church,
[45:05] Father. Lord Jesus, I I realize, God,
[45:08] that we're in a special moment. Father,
[45:11] I feel like there's something
[45:12] supernatural going to take place here
[45:14] today, Lord. just in my spirit, Lord, I
[45:17] feel like I feel like you're going to
[45:20] come and benefit your children today.
[45:22] So, Father, may may as our faith aligns
[45:25] with your word, Father, may you do
[45:27] exactly what you have said. And may our
[45:30] faith and our hearts and our and our
[45:32] spirits and everything about our
[45:33] dayto-day activities, oh God. May
[45:36] everything be in line with your word,
[45:38] Father, so that we could come before
[45:40] your great presence, Lord, realizing
[45:42] that we're washed and we're made clean.
[45:44] We are in a place where you can deal
[45:46] with our hearts. Hallelujah. We ask God
[45:49] that you'd come today as we dedicate
[45:51] this service to you. We love you so
[45:54] much, Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[45:58] Amen. If you have your Bibles today, I'd
[46:01] like to look in the book of Joel chapter
[46:04] 2 and verse 25 and then to Malachi
[46:06] chapter 4.
[46:09] Malachi 4 and 5.
[46:14] like to speak to you again on I will
[46:17] restore.
[46:19] I will restore.
[46:23] Trust this study has been okay for you.
[46:27] Realize that we've been given a a great
[46:29] message in this hour. A great message
[46:32] and so thankful for it. Aren't you?
[46:36] Amen. Joel 2 and verse 25.
[46:40] And I will restore to you the years.
[46:44] The years.
[46:46] The years.
[46:49] It been a lot of years.
[46:51] Been a lot of ages that went by. But God
[46:53] says, "I will restore to you the years."
[46:56] You remember when the king was dead,
[47:00] what did he do? He asked for more years.
[47:03] Maybe you haven't served God the best of
[47:05] your abilities in some of your years.
[47:08] But maybe you say, "God, would restore
[47:10] to me the years that I spent wasting my
[47:14] time. Now give me the opportunity to
[47:17] serve you from the depths of my soul.
[47:19] And I will restore to you the years that
[47:21] the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm,
[47:24] and the caterpillar, and the palmer, and
[47:26] my great army, which I sent amongst you.
[47:28] You shall eat in plenty, and be
[47:29] satisfied, and praise the name of the
[47:31] Lord your God, that it dwelt wondrously
[47:34] with you. and my people shall never be
[47:36] ashamed. And you shall know that I am in
[47:39] the midst of Israel, and that I am the
[47:41] Lord your God, and none else. And my
[47:44] people shall never be ashamed. And it
[47:47] shall come to pass afterward that I will
[47:49] pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and
[47:52] your sons and your daughters shall
[47:53] prophesy. Your old men shall dream
[47:56] dreams, your young men shall see
[47:58] visions, and also upon the servants, and
[48:01] upon the handmmaids. In those days will
[48:04] I pour out my spirit. Malachi chapter 4
[48:09] verse 5.
[48:17] Behold
[48:18] I
[48:20] will send you.
[48:23] How many is identified as a UC class
[48:25] here this morning? Behold, I will send
[48:28] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[48:32] of the great and dreadful day of the
[48:34] Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the
[48:38] fathers to the children, and the heart
[48:40] of the children to their fathers, lest I
[48:43] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[48:46] May God bless his word. You may be
[48:47] seated.
[48:55] To me, it is one of my greatest honors
[48:58] if I could say that. It has been my
[49:00] honor in all things to to be a part of
[49:04] the message of the hour. To realize what
[49:07] what what class that we're actually
[49:09] sitting in this this morning to realize
[49:12] how wonderful that the Lord has been to
[49:14] us. That the message of the hour could
[49:16] come by our way and minister to us
[49:18] because it could have went by a lot of
[49:20] people. It could have went by a lot of
[49:22] places and it did, but there was a lot
[49:25] of people that could not receive it
[49:27] because they were not in a position and
[49:29] they were not elected before the
[49:30] foundation of the world to receive this
[49:32] great message that you and I have. So
[49:34] for me to be able to say it is my honor
[49:37] in anything. It is my greatest honor in
[49:40] this world to say that I'm a part of the
[49:42] message of the hour and to say that we
[49:45] follow the teachings of William Brandom.
[49:47] We realize that there are many people
[49:49] that might hear this for the first time
[49:51] or there might be people that hear it on
[49:52] the internet may not understand
[49:54] everything that we teach here and that
[49:56] we that we have this great understanding
[49:58] on the message of the hour. But we
[50:00] realize we realize this that God had
[50:03] said in his word that I was going to
[50:04] send you Elijah. And many people will
[50:07] look at that and we would see many
[50:09] people hear it from the from an outside
[50:11] realm and they would think that they
[50:13] would think that we're lifting up
[50:15] William Brandom. That's absolutely
[50:17] contrary. But what we're doing is
[50:19] putting ourselves right back in line
[50:21] where the word can be preeminent in the
[50:23] church of the living God. And you'll
[50:25] know, brother Brandham, if you've ever
[50:26] studied, if you've spent time studying
[50:28] out the message, you know good and well
[50:30] that brother Brandham never taugh put
[50:32] his teachings over top of the word. One
[50:34] time, Brother Brandham was at a personal
[50:36] friend's house and they had they had uh
[50:38] on their mantel, they had the Bible
[50:40] sitting there and on top of the Bible,
[50:42] they had one of brother Brandham's
[50:43] books. And brother Brandham walked over
[50:45] to the manel and they was just doing it
[50:46] halfaphazardly just stuck it up there.
[50:48] But brother Brandham told him said 'n
[50:49] now don't you ever do that. He said
[50:51] because my teachings come right here
[50:53] from this word right here. So when you
[50:55] go to studying out the message of the
[50:57] hour, brother Brandham is not bringing a
[50:59] new idea. Brother Brandham is not coming
[51:01] with his own ideology. Brother Brandham
[51:04] is simply as a messenger of the age. He
[51:07] is spending great time and tying up
[51:09] those loose ends and he's bringing those
[51:11] things back together. And brother
[51:12] William did a wonderful job a few few
[51:14] months ago speaking on what the message
[51:17] is. And if you hadn't heard it, go back
[51:19] and listen to it. Brother brother
[51:20] brother William did a wonderful job. I
[51:22] love his ministry in that way. But we
[51:24] look at this. We love we love this
[51:26] message because we realize that it is
[51:29] life to us. It is it is it gives us a
[51:31] great power when we realize and
[51:34] recognize what the message of the hour
[51:36] truly is. It's putting a church back on
[51:39] her feet again. But we when you look at
[51:41] the Elijah ministry, if you if you
[51:44] haven't if you haven't gotten this book
[51:45] on the five comingings of Elijah,
[51:47] Brother Timuit had put together, it'd be
[51:49] a great blessing for you to go and read
[51:51] those things. I believe we got them back
[51:52] there at the tape library or at at the
[51:54] book there, so you can grab it. If you
[51:56] don't have it, we got plenty more. But
[51:58] we realize when you go to looking at the
[52:00] Elijah Ministry, we realize that that
[52:03] that the Elijah ministry can be looked
[52:05] at in a few different ways. that the
[52:07] Elijah ministry to a lot of people that
[52:09] they'll look at it that the Elijah
[52:11] ministry was quite destructive. But they
[52:13] there's another way of looking at it is
[52:15] that the Elijah ministry came to restore
[52:18] and every single time that God used the
[52:20] spirit of Elijah to go and speak and
[52:22] deal with his children. All the Elijah
[52:24] ministry was to do was to restore God's
[52:26] people back to being God's re God's
[52:29] people again. And you notice in the
[52:31] first coming of Elijah, you will see
[52:33] that he begin to go in there and he
[52:36] restored the authority when he showed
[52:38] that he had the power to be able to go
[52:40] up there and shut up the heavens and he
[52:43] had the authority to loose the heavens
[52:45] at the same time. The Elijah ministry
[52:47] showed that he had the ability to
[52:50] restore life when there was a dead when
[52:52] there was a dead son and he raised him
[52:55] back to life again. It's the first
[52:57] resurrection that is accounted for in
[52:59] the Bible. You see him also go in there
[53:01] and restore provision to a to a little
[53:04] old widow woman that only had meal and
[53:06] some oil there. And what did the Elijah
[53:08] ministry do? He restored the spiritual
[53:11] food in due season. Then you see the
[53:14] greatest to me one of the greatest spots
[53:16] is where you see the Elijah ministry
[53:18] come in is you see him restoring back
[53:21] true worship again. You notice when he
[53:24] goes in there, HE GOES TO CALLING ISRAEL
[53:26] BACK TOGETHER and he doesn't HE DOESN'T
[53:28] CALL THEM BACK to a mixture of gods. HE
[53:31] BRINGS THEM OUT OF A mixture of
[53:33] denominations and BAAL WORSHIP AND BAAL
[53:36] IDEAS AND HE BRINGS THEM BACK TO the
[53:38] worship of a true and living God. He
[53:41] showed them what it was to do when he
[53:43] restored the broken altar and he took
[53:46] all 12 stones. And it's powerful when
[53:48] you study it. HE BUILDS ISRAEL RIGHT
[53:50] BACK in its position again. He didn't
[53:53] put 10 stones back in their place. He
[53:55] put all 12 stones back in their place
[53:58] and he restored that broken ALTAR
[54:00] BECAUSE FIRE CANNOT fall on A BROKEN
[54:03] HEART. FIRE CANNOT fall on A BROKEN
[54:06] ALTAR. SO THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE OF THE
[54:08] HOUR IS SO POWERFUL IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT
[54:11] THE HOLY GHOST IS THAT THE HOLY GHOST
[54:13] COULD NOT FULLY COME UPON YOUR LIFE
[54:15] UNTIL YOU HAD A RESTORED HEART. AND THAT
[54:18] IS WHAT THE MINISTRY OF ELIJAH IS TO DO.
[54:21] IT'S TO RESTORE YOUR HEART BACK TO THE
[54:24] FAITH of the Pentecostal fathers.
[54:27] Now, brother Bradam say, excuse me,
[54:30] brother brother Puit says here, and I
[54:31] just want to draw this in the five
[54:33] comingings of Elijah. He said, "This is
[54:36] the work of Elijah." His trademark of
[54:38] his ministry is to restore worship back
[54:41] to whom it belongs. and by repairing and
[54:44] restoring THE ALTAR AND TURNING THE
[54:46] HEARTS BACK to the original AND TRUE
[54:48] FAITH. HE SAID THAT IS WHAT THE SPIRIT
[54:50] OF Elijah will do each time that he
[54:52] comes. That is THAT HE WILL NOT
[54:55] INSTITUTE a new religion. William
[54:57] Brandham did not institute a new
[54:58] religion but rather he will take the
[55:01] STONES OF THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATIONAL
[55:03] DOCTRINES AND PUT THEM BACK IN THEIR
[55:06] PROPER POSITION AND TURN THE HEARTS OF
[55:08] THE BELIEVERS BACK TO THE ORIGINAL
[55:11] FAITH. SO WE LOOK THAT THE MINISTRY OF
[55:14] ELIJAH IS TO RESTORE THE FAITH. WHAT WAS
[55:18] THE MINISTRY OF MALACHI 4 TO DO? IT WAS
[55:20] TO PUT THE POWER BACK IN THE CHURCH. TO
[55:24] PUT FAITH BACK IN OPERATION AGAIN. YOU
[55:27] WATCH WHAT WAS THE FIRST PULL OF BROTHER
[55:29] BRANDHAM'S MINISTRY. IT WAS TO SIMPLY
[55:31] PUT THE BAIT OUT THERE ON THE HOOK AND
[55:34] SHOW THEM. SHOW OUT THERE BECAUSE HE WAS
[55:36] GOING AFTER A RAINBOW TROUT AND IT
[55:38] CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN. WHAT DID IT
[55:41] DO? IT RESTORED THE FAITH BACK TO THE
[55:43] CHURCH TO REALIZE. YOU THINK YOU GOT
[55:46] GREAT MEN LIKE CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW THAT
[55:48] WOULD SIT there in A LITTLE HILLBILLY
[55:50] KENTUCKY MEETINGS BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM
[55:53] BRANDHAM. A MAN THAT HAD SAT WITH SOME
[55:55] OF THE GREATEST IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD
[55:57] SET IN THE GREATEST OF THE GOVERNMENTS.
[55:59] THERE HE WAS SITTING LISTENING TO A MAN
[56:02] HALLELUJAH THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO
[56:05] RESTORE HIS FAITH THAT GOD WAS STILL
[56:08] GOD.
[56:10] HALLELUJAH.
[56:12] ME AND MY wife was watching a
[56:13] documentary a while back. A man that was
[56:16] dealing with cancer and he was HAD
[56:17] TUMORS IN HIS BODY AND HE HAD WENT
[56:19] EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD trying to FIND
[56:22] FAITH OR TRYING TO GET HEALED AND TRYING
[56:24] TO GET A MIRACLE. HE WENT TO THIS
[56:25] CHURCH. HE WENT TO THAT CHURCH. HE WENT
[56:27] HERE. THIS IS A MODERN-DAY MAN. HE WENT
[56:29] TO THIS CHURCH. HE WENT OVERSEAS. HE
[56:31] WENT HERE AND THERE. AND I THOUGHT, MY
[56:32] GOD,
[56:34] THERE THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR HAS BEEN
[56:36] SETTING HERE. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
[56:38] ACROSS THIS PLACE AND THAT PLACE OR
[56:40] HERE. ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS COME BACK
[56:44] BECAUSE THIS MESSAGE WILL RESTORE YOUR
[56:46] FAITH TO BELIEF THAT ALL THINGS ARE
[56:48] POSSIBLE. WHAT DID CONGRESSMAN UPSHAW?
[56:51] HE WAS BOUND 66 YEARS. BUT IN A MATTER
[56:55] OF A SECOND, A VISION SPOKE OVER HIS
[56:58] LIFE AND HE WAS COMPLETELY MADE WHOLE.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; What did the message of William Brandham
[57:05] do? It put faith back in oper operation.
[57:08] IT PUT POWER BACK IN THE CHURCH where it
[57:10] rightly should have been. And when IT'S
[57:12] SO POWERFUL IS WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR
[57:15] LIFE AND YOU REALIZE THAT it ain't just
[57:17] for William Brandon. HALLELUJAH. WHEN
[57:19] YOU REALIZE IT AIN'T JUST FOR THE
[57:20] PREACHER. WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S FOR OUR
[57:22] YOUNG PEOPLE. WHEN YOU REALIZE IT'S FOR
[57:24] EVERY ONE OF YOU. THAT THAT IS WHERE
[57:26] KNOWING THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS BEEN
[57:28] GIVEN BACK TO THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING
[57:30] GOD. THAT IT'S NOW IN TIME IN TIME TO
[57:33] IMPART TO GO TO THE ANGEL, TAKE THE
[57:36] BOOK, EAT THE BOOK, BECOME THE BOOK.
[57:39] SOMEONE IS GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF THIS
[57:42] MESSAGE. THEY'RE GOING TO GRAB A HOLD OF
[57:44] THIS MESSAGE. EVEN THOUGH IT GOES TO WAR
[57:46] IN THEIR BODY, THEY'RE GOING TO EAT IT
[57:48] AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP IT DOWN.
[57:50] THEY'RE GOING TO EAT IT AND THEY'RE
[57:52] GOING TO KEEP IT DOWN. IF MICHAEL WAS
[57:54] STANDING UP, IF MALACHI 4 WAS STANDING
[57:57] UP, IF THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST WAS
[57:59] STANDING UP, THEN THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[58:01] BRIDE
[58:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IN THE SAME POSITION AS MICHAEL,
[58:06] AS CHRIST, AS WILLIAM BRHAM, IF A WAVE
[58:09] CHIEF OF THE MESSAGE WENT OVER, then
[58:12] there's got to be a people that's ready
[58:14] to stand up.
[58:17] Hallelujah. You remember we were on the
[58:20] wrong road, sis. We was going the wrong
[58:23] way. Just like the disciples on the road
[58:25] to Emmas, they was walking the wrong
[58:27] way. But when Jesus showed up
[58:31] AND JESUS STARTED TAKING THEM FROM DEITY
[58:34] OF CHRIST ALL THE WAY TO LEADERSHIP, WE
[58:36] WERE ON OUR WRONG ROAD. WE WERE GOING
[58:38] THE WRONG WAY. BUT WHEN JESUS BE TO
[58:41] BREAK THE BREAD OF LIFE, HE OPENED THEIR
[58:44] UNDERSTANDING AND THEN THEY TURNED. THE
[58:48] MESSAGE turned
[58:51] is powerful. It turned their
[58:54] understanding and what took them all day
[58:57] to get over there where they was going.
[59:00] Just took them a few minutes to get back
[59:01] to where they was at. You see, he said,
[59:05] "I will restore to you the years." We
[59:09] know this, but God is going to have a
[59:11] church
[59:14] AGAINST ALL OF SATAN'S OPPOSITIONS. GOD
[59:18] is going to have a church. COULD I SAY
[59:20] IT TO YOU LIKE THIS? IS THAT GOD'S GOT A
[59:22] CHURCH AND HE'S GOT A LADY THAT
[59:24] DESTROYED TO REFUSE TO LISTEN TO MS AND
[59:28] SAY THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE HER LEGACY.
[59:30] THERE WAS A LADY, SISTER CHASSITY
[59:32] BOWMAN, THAT REFUSED TO BELIEVE THE
[59:34] DEVIL'S LIE BECAUSE GOD WILL HAVE A
[59:38] CHURCH.
[59:43] HALLELUJAH.
[59:45] MY SISTER WAS A WOMAN THAT COULDN'T HAVE
[59:48] CHILDREN, BUT GOD SAID, "I WILL HAVE A
[59:50] CHURCH THAT WILL BELIEVE THAT I CAN OPEN
[59:53] UP BARREN WOUNDS AGAIN BECAUSE GOD WILL
[59:56] HAVE A CHURCH."
[59:58] MARIAH PUIT WAS A PLACE AS A WAS A
[1:00:01] CONDITION WHERE THE SEED OF GOD COULD
[1:00:03] FALL IN A LITTLE BITTY TEENAGE GIRL AND
[1:00:06] SAY, "I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ALIPCIA, I
[1:00:09] DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO, BUT
[1:00:11] IT'S GOT TO LEAVE ME BECAUSE I GOT THE
[1:00:13] FAITH OF A MUSTARD SEED." AND WHAT DID
[1:00:16] GOD DO? HE PUT HAIR BACK ON THAT LITTLE
[1:00:20] GIRL'S HEAD BECAUSE GOD SAID, "I WILL
[1:00:22] HAVE A CHURCH.
[1:00:28] Do I have to remind you
[1:00:31] about your pastor?
[1:00:34] God will have a church.
[1:00:37] It wasn't just for the three Hebrew
[1:00:38] boys, but God said, "I will have a
[1:00:41] church that can walk through the fire.
[1:00:42] So, I'm going to raise up a Ron Spencer
[1:00:45] that can go through strokes and go
[1:00:46] through lightning strikes and GO THROUGH
[1:00:48] ALL THESE DIFFERENT DETAILS." Don't you
[1:00:50] take it from some great Don't take it
[1:00:52] for some small thing that God put the
[1:00:55] leadership here right in front OF THIS
[1:00:57] CHURCH RIGHT HERE IN ELTON to be a proof
[1:01:00] that God will HAVE A CHURCH AGAINST ALL
[1:01:02] ODDS
[1:01:04] AGAINST ALL ODDS. THAT GOD WILL
[1:01:07] DEMONSTRATE HIS GREAT POWER, HIS
[1:01:09] ABILITIES. BECAUSE GOD WILL HAVE A
[1:01:12] CHURCH THAT WILL REPRESENT HIM IN POWER,
[1:01:15] IN TRUTH, AND IN DEMONSTRATION.
[1:01:18] GOD WILL HAVE A CHURCH. They will be
[1:01:21] under his kingship, under the rulership
[1:01:24] of the baptism OF THE HOLY GHOST. THEY
[1:01:26] WILL BE BIRTHED BY THE WORD. THEY WILL
[1:01:28] BE BOUGHT BY THE WORD. AND THEY WILL
[1:01:30] ONLY SPEAK THE WORD. The Bible said in
[1:01:33] Galatians 3:7, "Know ye therefore that
[1:01:36] they which are of faith? The same are
[1:01:38] the children of Abraham, and the
[1:01:40] SCRIPTURE FORESEEING THAT GOD WOULD
[1:01:43] JUSTIFY THE HEATHEN through faith,
[1:01:45] preached before the gospel unto Abraham,
[1:01:47] SAYING, IN THEE SHALL all nations be
[1:01:50] blessed." So then they WHICH BE OF FAITH
[1:01:53] ARE BLESSED. SOMEBODY SAY, "BLESSED,
[1:01:56] with faithful Abraham." SO THE CHURCH
[1:02:00] HAS GOT TO REALIZE THE POWER THAT'S BEEN
[1:02:03] GIVEN TO HER. You remember Jesus SAID,
[1:02:06] "WHATSOEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH, I WILL
[1:02:08] BIND IN HEAVEN. AND WHATSOEVER YOU loose
[1:02:11] on earth, I will loose in heaven."
[1:02:13] YOU'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT WHEN JESUS IS
[1:02:15] STANDING THERE, HE SAID, "ALL POWER IN
[1:02:18] HEAVEN AND IN EARTH IS GIVEN UNTO ME,
[1:02:21] AND ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST, GOD POURED
[1:02:24] IN THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD."
[1:02:27] SO WHY SHOULD WE FEAR OF WHAT COMES OUR
[1:02:30] WAY? WHY SHOULD WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT
[1:02:33] COMES OUR WAY? WHY SHOULD WE THINK AND
[1:02:36] BEGIN TO BE A DEEP THINKER ABOUT THE
[1:02:39] THINGS THAT CONSTANTLY ARE ATTACKING US?
[1:02:42] ARE YOU HEARING ME TODAY? The prophet
[1:02:44] said, "When every talk of fear is
[1:02:46] vanished and the Holy Spirit is
[1:02:48] completely in control of the church,
[1:02:50] THEN ALL FEARS ARE GONE. AND THAT CHURCH
[1:02:53] HAS THE POWER.
[1:02:57] WHY? They have everything between that
[1:02:59] everything that heaven owns behind them.
[1:03:01] They are ambassadors of the throne.
[1:03:03] Absolutely. AN AMBASSADOR. CHRIST HAS
[1:03:06] THE AUTHORITY. EVERYTHING THAT CHRIST
[1:03:09] OWNS BELONGS to that ambassador.
[1:03:14] Too many times people think, well, if I
[1:03:15] was in the days of William Brandham, you
[1:03:17] are still in the days of the son of man.
[1:03:21] COME ON, SOMEBODY. YOU DON'T NEED SOME
[1:03:23] PROPHET TO SIT HERE AND DISCERN YOUR
[1:03:25] HEART. YOU DON'T NEED SOME MAN OF GOD TO
[1:03:27] COME UP HERE AND SPEAK SOMETHING OVER
[1:03:30] YOUR LIFE. THIS MESSAGE HAS DISCERNED
[1:03:33] THE VERY THOUGHTS OF YOUR HEART. THERE
[1:03:35] IS ONLY ONE MALACHI 4. THERE IS ONLY ONE
[1:03:38] MESSIAH SIGN. THIS MESSAGE IS THE ANSWER
[1:03:42] TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION. AND WHERE DID
[1:03:45] GOD CHOOSE TO PUT IT? ON THE INSIDE OF
[1:03:48] LITTLE OU.
[1:03:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:56] He said, "Oh, go into all the world. You
[1:03:58] are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost
[1:04:00] has come upon you." And what is a
[1:04:02] witness? It's an ambassador to come and
[1:04:05] WITNESS SOMETHING. THE WHOLE POWERS OF
[1:04:08] heavens is right in your hands.
[1:04:13] You know, we got these little kids here
[1:04:15] and I I they always ask that question.
[1:04:18] If you had
[1:04:20] If you could choose a power, what would
[1:04:23] it be? If you could choose a a hero
[1:04:25] power, would you fly? Would you be in
[1:04:28] the invisible man?
[1:04:32] Or would you would you just be able to
[1:04:34] look through certain things? I don't
[1:04:36] have to wonder
[1:04:39] what kind of power I would choose. I
[1:04:42] choose this power any day.
[1:04:45] I choose this power. I wouldn't choose
[1:04:46] to fly. I wouldn't choose to be able to
[1:04:49] just simply be like Batman and ride down
[1:04:51] a road. And I simply would I definitely
[1:04:52] wouldn't choose to be like Spider-Man.
[1:04:54] That would depend on some web to get
[1:04:56] caught up in. I wouldn't choose to be
[1:04:58] Superman and I wouldn't choose to be one
[1:05:00] of the one of the Avengers, but I choose
[1:05:02] to be a son of God. Come on, SOME I
[1:05:05] CHOOSE TO BE A SON OF GOD BECAUSE I WANT
[1:05:07] YOU TO KNOW THAT ALL THE POWERS OF
[1:05:09] HEAVEN AND IN EARTH ARE DWELLING IN THE
[1:05:12] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. WHY LIMIT
[1:05:14] YOURSELF TO BE SUPERMAN OR BATMAN OR
[1:05:17] SPIDER-MAN WHEN YOU CAN BE GOD'S MAN
[1:05:19] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, SANCTIFIED,
[1:05:22] SET ASIDE SO GOD COULD USE YOU. WHY DO
[1:05:24] YOU SIT THERE AND TRY TO BE BARREN?
[1:05:26] DON'T BE DORMANT. DON'T BE BARREN. LET
[1:05:29] YOUR LIFE LIVE A FRUIT OF THE HOLY
[1:05:32] SPIRIT.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; IF A DEVIL'S ATTACKING YOU, CONDEMN THAT
[1:05:36] THING. WALK OVER THAT THING. IF SATAN'S
[1:05:39] ROBBING YOU, TAKE IT BACK.
[1:05:43] JAMES SAID in 1 and8, "Of his own will
[1:05:47] begott us with the word of truth."
[1:05:52] My daddy didn't convince me of this
[1:05:54] message. MY GRANDFATHER HOMER DID not
[1:05:57] condense convince me of this message.
[1:06:00] BUT I HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN OF ALMIGHTY
[1:06:03] GOD. WHEN THE SON OF MAN STANDING there
[1:06:06] in LUKE 18 SAID, "WHEN I RETURN AGAIN,
[1:06:09] WILL I FIND FAITH?" I WOULD LIKE to
[1:06:11] announce there's a people in position
[1:06:14] THAT BELIEVE. THEY'RE NOT BARREN.
[1:06:17] THEY'RE NOT DORMANT. THEY'RE NOT
[1:06:19] WONDERING when I have a body.
[1:06:24] It's amazing to think that God has put
[1:06:27] on the inside of you the power to look
[1:06:30] the other way. You remember when brother
[1:06:32] would talk about a thinking man's
[1:06:34] filter? He said that thinking man, he
[1:06:35] said he'll look the other way when a
[1:06:37] woman walks down the road and she's got
[1:06:39] that ungodly dress on. You remember that
[1:06:41] preacher that stood here? He said some
[1:06:43] people some people sit there and say,
[1:06:45] "Oh my, look at that sin."
[1:06:49] But the prophet said, "A thinking man
[1:06:52] will turn HIS HEAD." AIN'T IT POWERFUL
[1:06:54] TO RECOGNIZE that the church OF THE
[1:06:56] LIVING GOD HAS GOT THE POWER TO LOOK THE
[1:06:59] OTHER WAY INSTEAD OF LOOKING? AND I KNOW
[1:07:02] IT'S A POWERFUL THING WHEN YOU CAN TURN
[1:07:03] YOUR HEAD AND NOT LOOK AT THEM THINGS.
[1:07:05] BUT LET'S LOOK AT IT IN A DEEPER
[1:07:07] PERSPECTIVE. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM
[1:07:09] NEGATIVE THOUGHTS. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY
[1:07:12] FROM FAILURES. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM
[1:07:14] SIN. TURN YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM MISTAKES.
[1:07:17] A THINKING MAN WILL TURN HIS HEAD. I'M
[1:07:21] NOT THE SAME GUY BECAUSE I AM CONTROLLED
[1:07:25] BY A POWER.
[1:07:28] I am NOT MY OWN. MY LIFE IS NOT MY OWN.
[1:07:32] I am bought with a price. The prophet
[1:07:35] said in questions answers. He said the
[1:07:37] law of the spirit of God in the heart
[1:07:39] overcomes the flesh and makes the body
[1:07:43] obey what the heart says do.
[1:07:46] THE BODY HAS TO OBEY WHAT THE HEART SAYS
[1:07:50] DO. HE SAID LOOK THEN if it will do that
[1:07:52] for a sinner then won't it do it for
[1:07:54] sickness too?
[1:07:57] IF IT'LL MAKE YOUR HEART MAKE IF YOUR
[1:07:59] HEART WILL MAKE YOUR BODY OBEY WHAT YOU
[1:08:02] SAY, THEN SURELY THEN IT CAN MAKE
[1:08:04] SICKNESS DO THE SAME THING. WHEN YOU
[1:08:07] LOOK AT THE SCRIPTURE AND YOU REALIZE
[1:08:09] YOU CAN'T DO IT ON YOUR OWN, BUT THE
[1:08:11] BIBLE SAID IN ISAIAH 53 AND5 THAT BY HIS
[1:08:14] STRIPES I AM HEALED. THEN YOUR BODY HAS
[1:08:18] GOT TO OBEY WHAT YOUR HEART SAYS DO.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; SICKNESS HAS GOT TO LISTEN TO ME. DEMONS
[1:08:24] HAVE GOT TO LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:08:27] SOMETHING THAT IS CONTROLLING THE INSIDE
[1:08:30] OF ME.
[1:08:31] It's like It's like maybe we'll just put
[1:08:34] it in this picture. This building, this
[1:08:37] building here, we have a hard time with
[1:08:39] a thermostat here. We can't please
[1:08:42] everybody. So, they try to please some
[1:08:45] people.
[1:08:49] But it's I won't tell you who them some
[1:08:51] people are, but I believe you got a good
[1:08:54] idea because you got some people that
[1:08:56] are shivering cold. You got some people
[1:08:58] that are about to give this place wings.
[1:08:59] They're flying off. They got everything
[1:09:01] going all at one time. You know what I'm
[1:09:04] saying is I'm trying not to look at you
[1:09:06] because I don't want to see what you're
[1:09:07] doing out there. But do you realize this
[1:09:10] that on the outside there that that that
[1:09:13] this building it can become IT CAN
[1:09:16] BECOME A CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHAT IS
[1:09:18] HAPPENING on the outside. So like right
[1:09:20] now it's it's very cold outside and it's
[1:09:22] going to get colder because we're in the
[1:09:24] dead of winter. BUT YOU REALIZE THIS IS
[1:09:26] THERE'S SOME CONTROLLING POWER THAT
[1:09:28] WE'VE HAD SOME BROTHERS SET UP HERE AND
[1:09:30] IT'S CALLED THE THERMOSTAT. AND THAT
[1:09:32] THERMOSTAT AND EVEN THOUGH EVEN THOUGH
[1:09:35] THERE'S SOMETHING COLD ON THE OUTSIDE,
[1:09:37] THE THERMOSTAT SAYS, "OH NO, I GOT TO
[1:09:40] HAVE IT AT SUCH AND SUCH TEMPERATURE."
[1:09:42] SO THE THERMOSTAT ON THE INSIDE CONTROLS
[1:09:46] WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE OUTSIDE.
[1:09:49] SO YOU CAN SAY, "I WILL NOT BE A VICTIM
[1:09:52] OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAPPENS IN
[1:09:55] LEOSA.
[1:09:56] I WILL REFUSE TO LISTEN TO THE LIE OF
[1:09:59] THE DEVIL, BUT I WILL LET THE HOLY GHOST
[1:10:02] TAKE CONTROL OF ME AND CONTROL THE
[1:10:05] OUTSIDE.
[1:10:08] SOMEBODY IS GOING TO REFUSE THE LIE OF
[1:10:10] THE DEVIL. SOMEBODY'S GOING TO STEP UP
[1:10:13] AND ACCEPT THAT GOD'S FOR THEM.
[1:10:17] CONTROL THAT THING. CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.
[1:10:20] CONTROL MALICE. CONTROL THE LYING SPIRIT
[1:10:23] OF HELL.
[1:10:25] DON'T LET THE DEVIL LIE TO YOU AND TELL
[1:10:27] YOU YOU DON'T HAVE POWER AND ABILITY.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; I got a thermostat.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:40] So I decide what conditions.
[1:10:50] I decide
[1:10:52] because I'm representing heaven.
[1:10:56] I decide what I will control. I decide
[1:11:01] with my decisions. Well, I will refuse
[1:11:04] to speak the devil's language or I
[1:11:07] choose to speak God's.
[1:11:09] You got a choice here this morning.
[1:11:11] What's going to happen in your life? You
[1:11:14] going to set the conditions of your life
[1:11:15] and you're going to let Satan rob you.
[1:11:18] GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." SO, EITHER
[1:11:20] you're going to sit there and let Satan
[1:11:22] rob from you and keep on robbing from
[1:11:24] you, or one of these DAYS, YOU'RE GOING
[1:11:26] TO WAKE up and realize that you got
[1:11:27] something on the inside OF YOU THAT GOD
[1:11:29] ORDAINED BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:11:31] WORLD. WILLIAM BRANDHAM SAID, "OH, I
[1:11:33] WISH THAT THE CHURCH HAD THEIR JOY SHELL
[1:11:35] SHOES ON." HE SAID, "OH, THAT I WISH
[1:11:38] THAT YOU HAD THE JOY SHOES ON." HE SAID,
[1:11:40] "HOW DO YOU GET YOUR JOY SHOES ON?" HE
[1:11:42] SAID, "KNOWING THAT YOUR NAME WAS
[1:11:44] WRITTEN ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE
[1:11:45] BEFORE YOU COULD EVER MAKE THE WRONG
[1:11:47] CHOICE." SO, THE CHOICES I'M MAKING IS
[1:11:51] CONTROLLED BY THE FATHER.
[1:12:03] I was looking at this,
[1:12:06] just looking at it as a pastor where to
[1:12:09] lay these things at and in order
[1:12:13] and the spirit of God talked to me and
[1:12:15] said, "Turn it loose." And I thought,
[1:12:19] "Turn it loose." All right.
[1:12:22] And to me, one of the greatest stories
[1:12:24] about turning it loose is David
[1:12:30] is that David
[1:12:32] had to make a decision
[1:12:36] because we we realize that brother
[1:12:39] Brandham when he he laces this in in
[1:12:41] restoration of bribery and I've always
[1:12:43] been amazed at this is that brother
[1:12:44] Brandham went home after listening to
[1:12:46] brother Orman Neville preach a subject
[1:12:49] and went home and said he went a few
[1:12:51] notes
[1:12:52] He come backs and preach one of the
[1:12:53] greatest masterpieces that ever has
[1:12:55] been. I tell you what, it's good to have
[1:12:56] an angel there to talk to you, ain't it?
[1:12:59] And here he is. He comes back and he
[1:13:00] laces in these powerful things. And if
[1:13:03] you go to studying it out and studying
[1:13:05] restoration of the bride and you
[1:13:07] actually study it out in segments, it's
[1:13:09] powerful because brother Brandham laces
[1:13:11] in some very powerful things. And he
[1:13:13] starts talking about a bird, how that a
[1:13:16] bird has got a law and it's got the law
[1:13:18] of aerodynamics where it's got so much
[1:13:21] power. It's got thrust. It's got lift in
[1:13:23] it. And you see gravity is still at
[1:13:26] work. But that bird defies that law of
[1:13:29] gravity because he's got a law on the
[1:13:31] inside of him to defy that thing. Then
[1:13:34] brother Brandon talks about a fish. He
[1:13:36] said that fish has got a law. He said
[1:13:38] it's got the ability to take take its
[1:13:41] abilities and go in and sink all the way
[1:13:44] down to the bottom. Now you try to
[1:13:46] reverse them two laws between the bird
[1:13:47] and the fish and they actually they'll
[1:13:50] die completely because they don't have
[1:13:51] the abilities. They don't have the
[1:13:53] abilities to go where the other one can
[1:13:55] go. And you have been given a power to
[1:13:58] go where Satan can never get to. You've
[1:14:00] been given a law that only only you can
[1:14:03] go there. The church world can't go
[1:14:04] there. Demons of hell can't go there.
[1:14:06] And even though they might whisper in
[1:14:08] your ear and constantly attack you, but
[1:14:10] I want you to know that you got a rock
[1:14:12] that you can go to because you're an
[1:14:14] eagle under an eagle anointing and you
[1:14:16] were born by a law to lift up in a
[1:14:19] little bit higher. And you're going TO
[1:14:20] HAVE TO DEFY THE LAWS OF GRAVITY. IF
[1:14:24] YOUR arm can raise ITS HAND AND DEFY THE
[1:14:27] ACTS OF GRAVITY, THEN SO CAN YOUR SOUL
[1:14:30] DEFY THE ACTS OF HELL. BECAUSE DAVID DID
[1:14:33] THE SAME EXACT THING WHEN HE BEGIN TO
[1:14:36] STAND OUT THERE AND HE WOULD HEAR THE
[1:14:38] BOAST OF THE ENEMY AND HE WOULD SAY
[1:14:40] THEY'RE THEY'RE A BUNCH OF SCAREDY-CATS.
[1:14:42] THEY'RE AFRAID AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHO
[1:14:44] THEY ARE. BUT DAVID HAD A FAITH THAT HE
[1:14:47] WAS GOING TO TURN LOOSE. HE WAS GOING TO
[1:14:49] LET THAT LAW OF FAITH LOOSE. AND NOTICE
[1:14:52] WHAT DID DAVID DO? HE BEGIN TO PROPHESY
[1:14:55] TO THAT OLD D THAT OLD GIANT. HE BE TO
[1:14:58] GO OUT THERE AND TALK TO HIM. HE TALKED
[1:15:00] TO SAUL. HE TALKED TO ALL THE PEOPLE
[1:15:03] WHEN THEY MADE FUN OF HIM AND SAID HE
[1:15:04] WAS NOTHING BUT a shrimp THAT CALLED HIM
[1:15:06] THAT HE'D COME UP THERE JUST TO SEE THE
[1:15:07] BATTLE. BUT DAVID HAD SOMETHING THAT HE
[1:15:10] WAS GOING TO TURN LOOSE THAT DAY AND HE
[1:15:12] WAS GOING TO BE MORE THAN FAITH. HE WAS
[1:15:14] GOING TO TURN LOOSE A STONE.
[1:15:17] HALLELUJAH. What did he do?
[1:15:21] He started talking about his past
[1:15:24] testimonies that God healed me of
[1:15:26] varicose veins. that God did that and I
[1:15:29] will not forget it. That God healed me
[1:15:32] of bitterness and I will not forget it.
[1:15:34] You see, there was a a line that came in
[1:15:37] and took a part of my earthly father's
[1:15:40] possession and I cannot forget how God
[1:15:42] used me that day when I was standing
[1:15:44] there in that field and I thought, "My
[1:15:46] God, I've got to represent Christ in
[1:15:48] this way. That door though I got 99 over
[1:15:51] here. That one still means something to
[1:15:52] my father and I'm not a true shepherd
[1:15:54] unless I go after that one sheep." You
[1:15:57] see, that's why God has ordained a
[1:15:58] pastor to stand there and go after that
[1:16:00] one lost sheep. He go out there and get
[1:16:03] him back because it means something to
[1:16:05] him. But this day, this was more than
[1:16:07] his earthly father's possession of a
[1:16:09] sheep. But this was his heavenly
[1:16:11] father's possession that all the
[1:16:12] children of Israel were up there. WHAT
[1:16:15] DID DAVID DO? DAVID TURNED THEIR FEAR
[1:16:18] INTO FAITH. WHEN THEY SAW A LITTLE BITTY
[1:16:21] OLD BOY, HE TURNED LOOSE HIS FAITH. AND
[1:16:24] THAT LITTLE BITTY BOY WENT AFTER HIS
[1:16:27] FATHER'S HIS HEAVENLY FATHER'S
[1:16:29] POSSESSION AND HE TURNED THEIR FEAR INTO
[1:16:32] FAITH. WHAT DID WILLIAM BRANDHAM DO IN
[1:16:35] THIS HOUR WHEN THAT MANIAC OUT THERE IN
[1:16:37] OREGON? HE TURNED THEIR FEAR INTO FAITH.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; So you are either going to control it or
[1:16:45] it's going to control you.
[1:16:48] Anybody
[1:16:50] ever been, maybe don't raise your hand,
[1:16:54] been in a controlling relationship?
[1:16:57] They control where you go. They control
[1:16:59] where you eat dinner. And that's your
[1:17:02] own family. They only let you go there.
[1:17:04] You choose what you eat.
[1:17:08] Now, my wife is not that kind of woman,
[1:17:11] but she does give me some instruction.
[1:17:14] A little more salad and a little still a
[1:17:16] little whole lot of ice cream. But you
[1:17:18] know good and well, God sent a man by
[1:17:20] the name of Brother Matthew McClarden.
[1:17:22] He sent me a word this week. Praise God.
[1:17:26] A little little clip. I I bless you,
[1:17:29] Sister Dorothy. You got a real man.
[1:17:33] He's up there preaching in Ohio and we
[1:17:34] praying for him. But he sent me this
[1:17:36] beautiful clip. Brother Chris is that
[1:17:39] doctor say that ice cream's good for
[1:17:41] you.
[1:17:46] Now, I don't know,
[1:17:50] probably don't align with some doctors,
[1:17:51] but you know, you got the ability to
[1:17:53] choose what doctor you going to listen
[1:17:54] to. So,
[1:17:59] where was I going with that?
[1:18:02] You're going to let control you what
[1:18:04] you're going to let control you.
[1:18:07] And there are certain places where
[1:18:09] people will let certain relationships
[1:18:12] control them. They control where they
[1:18:14] can fellowship at. They can control what
[1:18:17] church they go to. They can control what
[1:18:19] they listen to. I found out about our
[1:18:22] Lord Jesus Christ. He does not have to
[1:18:25] put you in a cage to control you.
[1:18:28] There's so many people that look at this
[1:18:30] message as dos and don'ts. They look at
[1:18:33] it as, well, I got to wear I'm I'm just
[1:18:36] going to drop a few things. It's not in
[1:18:39] my notes, but I'm going to drop a few
[1:18:40] things.
[1:18:41] There's there's a lot of people that
[1:18:43] look at the dos and don'ts and they they
[1:18:44] say, "Well, I got I if I'm going to
[1:18:46] serve God, I can't do this and I can't
[1:18:48] do that."
[1:18:51] Well, they preach about them
[1:18:55] skinny jeans
[1:18:58] and I can't wear them things and I
[1:18:59] really want to. Let me tell you
[1:19:00] something.
[1:19:02] I question you if you want to wear
[1:19:04] skinny jeans.
[1:19:06] Look like a skin down wiener. I don't
[1:19:08] know how in the dickens these boys get
[1:19:10] in them things. Must have a parachute
[1:19:12] that drops them right down in them
[1:19:13] thing.
[1:19:15] Look like a sausage. It's got links all
[1:19:17] around it.
[1:19:20] And then, well, if I if I serve God, I
[1:19:22] won't be able to wear my my dress just
[1:19:25] right so I can show my humps and my
[1:19:26] bumps.
[1:19:29] Look like two raccoons trying to get out
[1:19:31] of a sack.
[1:19:42] I found out about the message.
[1:19:45] It does not control you. William
[1:19:47] Brandham didn't control you. William
[1:19:50] Brandham didn't set certain things and
[1:19:52] say you got to do this or you're not
[1:19:54] going in the rapture. You know good and
[1:19:56] well that your pastor has never taken a
[1:19:58] shotgun and held it to your head said
[1:19:59] you sisters if you don't show up here
[1:20:01] with long hair.
[1:20:03] Anybody Anybody ever here had had that
[1:20:06] happen to them?
[1:20:08] I don't think so.
[1:20:10] ANYBODY HERE HAD A HAD when he when you
[1:20:12] wasn't just living right and all of a
[1:20:14] sudden the pastor come there says, "If
[1:20:15] you don't get to church by God and come
[1:20:17] here on SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
[1:20:19] MORNING AND SHOW UP, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:20:20] MISS IT." NAH. Cuz we ain't that kind of
[1:20:23] people and we ain't preaching that kind
[1:20:25] of a message.
[1:20:27] Because I know this that the law of the
[1:20:30] Holy Ghost will control all that is
[1:20:33] right.
[1:20:35] As I said last night, I didn't read no
[1:20:36] book on how to BE A DADDY AND MY WIFE
[1:20:38] DIDN'T READ A BOOK ON HOW TO BE A MAMA.
[1:20:40] WE SIMPLY TOOK IT RIGHT OUT OF THE
[1:20:42] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
[1:20:44] GO TO READ SOME BOOK OF HOW LONG YOU GOT
[1:20:46] TO WEAR YOUR SLEEVES AND DON'T CUT YOUR
[1:20:48] HAIR AND DO THOSE THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:20:50] HOUR.
[1:20:52] You look at THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST
[1:20:54] COME IN TO THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. YOU
[1:20:56] LOOK AT THEM, THEY SIMPLY DROPPED OFF
[1:20:58] THE THINGS THAT THEY KNEW WASN'T RIGHT.
[1:21:00] WHY? BECAUSE THE WORD DID IT.
[1:21:05] YOU AIN'T GOT TO SKIN SHEEP. THE WORD
[1:21:07] WILL TAKE PLACE. THE WORD WILL TAKE
[1:21:10] PREEMINENCE. YOU AIN'T GOT TO BEAT
[1:21:12] PEOPLE INTO IT. LET THEM LOVE IT.
[1:21:19] But I will tell you this.
[1:21:21] You are meant to control
[1:21:24] the devil.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I love this. This is the first portion
[1:21:29] of restorational labri. So we'll just go
[1:21:31] through this. He said in paragraph 85,
[1:21:33] he said like if somebody stole some
[1:21:35] property and they're holding the
[1:21:36] property captive and then you take the
[1:21:38] law and go after this person and the law
[1:21:40] forces and enforces this person to
[1:21:42] restore that property back to its
[1:21:44] natural power. HE SAID ENFORCEMENT. HE
[1:21:47] SAID ENFORCE. Then we are have the
[1:21:50] privilege to enforce upon Satan the
[1:21:52] claims that God give us. For God has a
[1:21:55] law and his word is a law. And God in
[1:21:58] this word made certain claims to the
[1:22:00] church. Therefore, we have a right to
[1:22:02] force THESE CLAIMS UPON SATAN AND SAY
[1:22:06] GIVE IT BACK. HE HAS TO DO IT BECAUSE WE
[1:22:09] CAN TAKE GOD'S AGENT, the Holy Spirit,
[1:22:10] AND GO RIGHT DOWN ON OUR KNEES AND SAY
[1:22:13] IT'S THUS SAYAITH THE LORD. HE'S GOT TO
[1:22:15] GIVE IT UP. THAT'S ALL. Because the Holy
[1:22:16] Spirit is there to make him do it. The
[1:22:18] law of the land is TO ENFORCE. IT'S BY
[1:22:20] THE LAND and for the land. But the law
[1:22:23] of THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS TO FORCE SATAN
[1:22:25] TO GIVE UP THAT WHICH HE has
[1:22:27] unrightfully, DECEITFULLY TAKEN FROM ALL
[1:22:30] FROM GOD. ALL THE SOULS OF MEN HAVE GOT
[1:22:33] TO COME BACK. HEALING IS THE CHILDREN
[1:22:35] BREAD. IT BELONGS TO US. JOY, GIVE IT
[1:22:38] BACK. RESTORATION, GIVE IT BACK. YOU ARE
[1:22:42] TO TAKE IT BY FORCE.
[1:22:45] Jesus said the kingdom SUFFER VIOLENCE,
[1:22:48] BUT THE VIOLENT TAKE IT BY FORCE. YOU
[1:22:51] GOT TO GET VIOLENT IN YOUR NATURE. YOU
[1:22:53] GOT TO GET VIOLENT IN YOUR NATURE AND
[1:22:54] SAY, "SATAN, THESE ARE MY CHILDREN."
[1:22:58] COME ON, DAVID. IT'S TIME TO GO DOWN TO
[1:23:00] ZIGLAG AND TAKE BACK WHAT IS RIGHTFULLY
[1:23:02] YOURS. SATAN, I ENFORCE YOU BY THE POWER
[1:23:06] OF THE HOLY GHOST. GIVE IT BACK.
[1:23:13] These signs shall follow them that
[1:23:17] believe in my name. They shall cast out
[1:23:20] devils in my name. They shall speak in
[1:23:23] tongues in my name. They shall lay hands
[1:23:25] on the sick and they shall recover in my
[1:23:28] name. This is not THE NAME OF A FATHER,
[1:23:30] NOT the name of a son, not the name of
[1:23:32] the holy ghost, but the name of all of
[1:23:34] heaven. And who I am representing.
[1:23:36] Heaven is here this morning to say,
[1:23:38] "Satan, you have deceitfully robbed the
[1:23:41] children of God of all of their
[1:23:42] inheritance." I say in THE NAME OF JESUS
[1:23:44] CHRIST, "GIVE IT BACK. GIVE IT BACK.
[1:23:48] GIVE IT BACK. GIVE ME BACK MY JOY. GIVE
[1:23:51] ME BACK MY PEACE. GIVE ME BACK MY
[1:23:53] ATMOSPHERE. GIVE ME BACK MY PRAISE."
[1:23:59] THE PROPHET said in divine healing, he
[1:24:03] said, "If we're living in this day when
[1:24:05] formalities and things is broken, the
[1:24:07] church down, broke away," he said, "It's
[1:24:10] God's word being fulfilled."
[1:24:13] As sure as God said these signs will
[1:24:14] follow them that believe, as sure as God
[1:24:17] said these churches would be like they
[1:24:19] are now, God also has said this
[1:24:22] opposition would meet it. So the same
[1:24:25] God that ordained signs and wonders,
[1:24:28] ordained at these should be persecuting
[1:24:32] against it.
[1:24:34] When you study Joel chapter 2 and you
[1:24:37] look at the destroyers, these bugs, the
[1:24:42] locust, the cankerworm, the palmer, and
[1:24:44] the caterpillar, when you look at it, we
[1:24:46] realize, you study the nature of it. You
[1:24:50] look in there and you see it is the
[1:24:52] antichrist spirit that is representing
[1:24:54] Rome and how that is coming in there to
[1:24:56] steal, to kill, and destroy. And they
[1:24:59] you watch these books that they
[1:25:02] systematically strip away the bride of
[1:25:05] its life. When you study when you study
[1:25:08] the message, you'll find it. But brother
[1:25:10] Brandham laces it in there so heavily
[1:25:13] there in the restoration of the bride
[1:25:15] tree. And he identifies this locust and
[1:25:18] you you study it. He said you look that
[1:25:20] locust. He said he focused on eating the
[1:25:22] leaves of that tree. He said the leaves
[1:25:24] of that tree was divine fellowship. He
[1:25:27] said the coolness or the freshness where
[1:25:29] people can find their rest in the Holy
[1:25:32] Spirit. But God said I will restore. And
[1:25:35] the Bible said in Acts 3:19 that when
[1:25:38] the times of refreshing shall come from
[1:25:40] the presence of the Lord, it is a part
[1:25:44] of the restoration that you can have a
[1:25:46] refreshing from the Lord. He said that
[1:25:48] that locust come in and it started to
[1:25:51] eat down brotherhood. He said the locust
[1:25:53] destroyed the fellowship between
[1:25:54] believers to different groups leading
[1:25:57] the formation of exclusive groups and
[1:26:00] exclusive organizations or clicks. You
[1:26:04] see what they did? They refuse to
[1:26:06] associate WITH OTHERS. AND TOO MANY
[1:26:08] TIMES YOU FIND THAT AMONGST MESSAGE
[1:26:11] BELIEVERS THAT SAME LOCUST BUG TRIES TO
[1:26:14] COME IN THERE SAID, "WELL, THEY'RE
[1:26:15] ONENESS." OR MAYBE THEY BELIEVE in the
[1:26:17] supernatural or THEY THEY BELIEVE THE
[1:26:18] WORD AND THEY THEY BELIEVE IN THE SPIRIT
[1:26:20] OR THIS THAT OR THE OTHER. THAT'S THAT
[1:26:22] SAME BOOK TRYING TO DISASSOCIATE WHAT
[1:26:26] GOD HAS SO PUT TOGETHER BY THE HOLY
[1:26:28] SPIRIT. BUT PAUL SAID IN EPHESIANS 4 AND
[1:26:31] THREE, ENDEAVORING TO KEEP THE UNITY OF
[1:26:35] THE SPIRIT IN THE BOND OF PEACE. THERE
[1:26:37] IS ONE BODY, ONE SPIRIT, even as YOU ARE
[1:26:40] CALLED IN THE ONE HOPE OF YOUR CALLING,
[1:26:42] one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
[1:26:44] God AND FATHER OF ALL WHO IS ABOVE ALL,
[1:26:46] THROUGH all and in you all.
[1:26:49] So when you see that bug come in, you
[1:26:52] refuse that devil. That's my brother.
[1:26:56] That's my sister.
[1:26:58] Maybe I don't see things like they do,
[1:27:00] but they're still my brother.
[1:27:03] You see a prophet stood here and made
[1:27:05] you aware of the bug of antichrist
[1:27:08] spirit that would try to come in. He
[1:27:10] goes on to say that the cankerworm he
[1:27:12] said if you study it out you see he said
[1:27:14] he went in there that cankerworm he said
[1:27:17] it bored right into the bark and brother
[1:27:19] Brandham said that the bark was the
[1:27:21] covering. He said it was the lifeline of
[1:27:23] the tree. He said it was religion. He
[1:27:25] said you watch that cankerworm's
[1:27:27] characteristics. He said it destroyed
[1:27:29] the church's original apostolic
[1:27:32] doctrine. What did it do? It went in
[1:27:34] there. It went in there and tried to rob
[1:27:36] the truth and the power away from the
[1:27:39] church of the living God. But the Bible
[1:27:42] said, "I will restore." And in Acts 2
[1:27:44] and 42, THE BIBLE SAID, "AND THEY
[1:27:46] CONTINUE STEADFASTLY IN THE APOSTLES
[1:27:49] DOCTRINE AND FELLOWSHIP." THAT'S WHY
[1:27:52] WHEN BROTHER MATTHEW WAS SPEAKING LAST
[1:27:53] WEEKEND ON BEING STEADFAST, YOU GOT TO
[1:27:56] STAY STEADFAST IN THE DOCTRINES BECAUSE
[1:27:58] WE ARE WE ARE POWERLESS WITHOUT TRUTH.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; WE ARE POWERLESS WITHOUT DOCTRINES.
[1:28:08] You take away our doctrines from us or
[1:28:10] simply just another church building.
[1:28:14] That enemy wants to come in there and
[1:28:16] make you include every devil in this
[1:28:18] world.
[1:28:22] The Bible said,
[1:28:25] The Bible said, "I will restore." What
[1:28:28] did they come in there and do? What was
[1:28:29] the What was the greatest thing they
[1:28:32] did? They went right after
[1:28:34] the water baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:28:36] Christ. You walk shankermorm how he
[1:28:39] comes in and caners at me. You watch
[1:28:41] what Brother Brandham said. He said,
[1:28:42] "You see that Roman power?" He said,
[1:28:44] 'It's worming its way right through the
[1:28:46] right through the cabinets, getting
[1:28:48] right in there with our governors and
[1:28:50] our senators and all all of our
[1:28:52] presidents and different things. He said
[1:28:54] it's warming. It's way right in there.
[1:28:57] But you watch what that canker worm did.
[1:28:59] It started to caner. You don't have to
[1:29:01] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:29:03] Jesus said that you go into all the
[1:29:05] world baptizing them in the name of the
[1:29:07] father, son, and holy ghost. But you'll
[1:29:09] notice this that every single time that
[1:29:12] the early believers baptized, they
[1:29:15] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:29:18] Christ. And you see, you study out
[1:29:20] Catholic history, you'll go in there and
[1:29:22] find they said, "Well, no, look, if you
[1:29:23] go all the way out, if you go back
[1:29:25] there, yeah, they did that. They Yeah,
[1:29:26] they did that back there in the early '
[1:29:28] 80s. But when you get up here, you
[1:29:30] recognize that the church was baptized
[1:29:31] in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost." You know why? because the
[1:29:34] Catholic Church was killing anybody and
[1:29:36] everybody that was baptized in THE NAME
[1:29:38] OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE." AND WHAT
[1:29:44] HAPPENED IN THIS HOUR IS THAT GOD HAD A
[1:29:47] PROPHET THAT BROUGHT US BACK NOT TO ONE
[1:29:50] LORD. HE DIDN'T JUST BRING US BACK TO
[1:29:52] JESUS ONLY. HE TOOK US BACK THAT JESUS
[1:29:55] WAS DEITY HIMSELF.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; THEY BAPTIZE ONLY IN THE NAME OF THE
[1:30:00] LORD JESUS CHRIST.
[1:30:03] You see what that cankerworm did? It
[1:30:06] also went in there and took away the
[1:30:08] sacrifice.
[1:30:10] He said it went in there and took away
[1:30:11] the understanding of the blood of Jesus
[1:30:14] Christ. But God said I will restore.
[1:30:19] Paul said in n Hebrews 9:14, "How much
[1:30:21] more shall the blood of Christ who
[1:30:23] through the eternal spirit offered
[1:30:25] himself without the spot of to God purge
[1:30:27] your conscience from dead works to serve
[1:30:29] the living God? I will restore." And
[1:30:32] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:30:34] lamb and by the word of their testimony.
[1:30:37] I will restore that cankerworm. Come in
[1:30:40] there and replace the spirit of truth
[1:30:43] with a spirit of creeds.
[1:30:45] Brother Brandham said they come in
[1:30:47] there. And I always I always loved when
[1:30:50] brother Brandham said that because
[1:30:51] brother Brandham had a way of making
[1:30:53] making words. He said they come in there
[1:30:56] with their unauthoritative words. What
[1:31:00] is an unauthoritative word? But it means
[1:31:01] it's got no power.
[1:31:04] He said what they did, they come in
[1:31:05] there and he said they gave them a form
[1:31:08] of godliness but they denied the power
[1:31:11] thereof. He went on further to say he
[1:31:13] said what they did. He said they come in
[1:31:15] there with their embombing fluids and
[1:31:17] they started pumping the church full of
[1:31:20] all this inbombing fluids of creeds and
[1:31:22] it went right down into their wombs that
[1:31:24] they can't bring forth children no more.
[1:31:25] It went right down there in the in the
[1:31:27] basement where they put the altar down
[1:31:29] there. It might rent right down there in
[1:31:30] the veins of the church. They're no fork
[1:31:32] and they never bring forth power and
[1:31:34] demonstration that can never bring forth
[1:31:36] signs and wonders because they've been
[1:31:38] pumped full of inbombing fluid because
[1:31:40] Satan wants to keep the church of the
[1:31:42] living God dead.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; But if you want to find authority, if
[1:31:46] you want to find authoritative words,
[1:31:48] the brother Brandham said that the never
[1:31:50] failing presence of Jesus Christ IS WITH
[1:31:52] YOU ALWAYS. AND THE ANGEL of the Lord
[1:31:54] accompanies the message. If you want to
[1:31:56] have some AUTHORITATIVE WORDS, GET BACK
[1:31:58] TO TALKING THE MESSAGE.
[1:32:02] And then he went in to the palm of
[1:32:05] he said its primary target was the fruit
[1:32:09] of the tree.
[1:32:12] Now you know good and well he's been
[1:32:14] after your fruit.
[1:32:17] He's been after your fruit.
[1:32:19] Well, how do you say that, Brother
[1:32:21] Andrew? I'll say it according to the
[1:32:24] word. The Bible said, "Praise ye the
[1:32:27] Lord." Let everything that hath breath
[1:32:31] praise ye the Lord.
[1:32:35] And I don't I don't mean to make this
[1:32:36] personal,
[1:32:38] but I am going to say it to you as a
[1:32:40] church. And if you don't want to listen
[1:32:42] to me on the internet, and I'm sorry for
[1:32:44] you, you have to listen to me, but those
[1:32:45] on the internet can click me off. But
[1:32:48] this church has constantly been
[1:32:49] criticized for her worship. This church
[1:32:52] has constantly been criticized for her
[1:32:55] praise, for her liberty in the message
[1:32:57] of the hour. And that's all right.
[1:32:59] That's all right. I really don't I
[1:33:01] really don't mind the criticism because
[1:33:02] criticism only shows where our true
[1:33:04] character is at.
[1:33:06] But you watch what he's tried to do to
[1:33:08] this church. He's tried to come in there
[1:33:10] and steal the very things that has been
[1:33:12] restored back to the church of the
[1:33:14] living God. It is our God-given right to
[1:33:17] worship the Lord.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now, God said, "I will restore." And I
[1:33:28] believe THIS THAT THERE'S REAL HOLY
[1:33:30] GHOST PRAISE. There's real Holy Ghost
[1:33:33] worship. There's real Holy GHOST JOY.
[1:33:35] AND I believe this that if we're going
[1:33:36] to do anything, then we OUGHT TO DO IT
[1:33:38] BY THE BIBLE. IS THAT RIGHT? IF WE'RE
[1:33:40] GOING TO WORSHIP, THEN WE OUGHT TO
[1:33:42] WORSHIP BY THE BIBLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO
[1:33:44] SHOUT, THEN WE OUGHT TO SHOUT BY THE
[1:33:46] BIBLE. IF WE'RE GOING TO DANCE, WE OUGHT
[1:33:48] TO DANCE BY THE BIBLE. AND GOD SAID, "I
[1:33:51] WILL RESTORE."
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; SO, I'M NOT GOING TO LET SOME DEVIL COME
[1:33:55] IN THERE AND TRY TO STEAL IT AWAY FROM
[1:33:56] YOU.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE YOU JOY.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE YOU PEACE. GOD GAVE YOU
[1:34:03] HOLINESS. AND AIN'T NO DEVIL GOING TO
[1:34:05] TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU.
[1:34:11] I WILL NOT BE LIKE MICHELLE AND MAKE FUN
[1:34:14] OF YOU OF YOU DANCING IN TRUE WORSHIP.
[1:34:17] BUT I SAY IF THE WORDS BACK IN ITS ORDER
[1:34:19] AND WE'RE WORKING RIGHT IN ACCORDING TO
[1:34:21] GOD'S PLAN, THEN LET'S DANCE.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; You know why you're dancing.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Sure. I know. There's a there's a holy
[1:34:34] dance and there's a worldly dance. If
[1:34:37] anybody knows that, I do.
[1:34:42] I learned how to dance
[1:34:45] in a club.
[1:34:49] I I I'm a I'm a real guy.
[1:34:53] I'm a real guy. I lived a former life.
[1:34:57] But I d The first place I danced was in
[1:34:59] a club. The first place I danced was
[1:35:01] dance parties.
[1:35:03] I was talking to Brother Alen last
[1:35:05] night. how how in the world we're here,
[1:35:06] but we're here. Praise God. And I I told
[1:35:09] him, I said, "You ever you ever been one
[1:35:10] of them dances where they where they
[1:35:12] used to do that old call and they call
[1:35:13] him out there said, "Now, spin your
[1:35:15] partner around and round."
[1:35:17] And I always enjoyed watching them
[1:35:19] things. Again, I'm I'm I'm honest.
[1:35:23] You say, "Brother Andrew, you shouldn't
[1:35:24] be saying those things." Well, sorry.
[1:35:27] You ain't got to listen to me.
[1:35:30] But I you know, that's where I I learned
[1:35:33] to dance. And then I got saved
[1:35:38] and somebody said, 'You know what? You
[1:35:40] used to dance a whole lot more when he's
[1:35:42] out there in the world. And I got
[1:35:44] thinking about that. It didn't take me
[1:35:46] about 10 seconds. And I got to think
[1:35:47] about it. I was standing right here and
[1:35:49] that person was standing right there and
[1:35:50] ain't here no more. They said, "You
[1:35:51] know, you used to dance a whole lot more
[1:35:53] when you was out there in the world." I
[1:35:55] sit there and I thought about it for 10
[1:35:56] seconds. You know what I did? I took off
[1:35:59] dancing.
[1:36:03] I danced all the way down that aisle.
[1:36:05] Well, it would been an aisle right here
[1:36:06] then. I danced all the WAY AROUND THAT
[1:36:08] AISLE. I DANCED ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE. I
[1:36:10] danced all the way up around there. And
[1:36:11] I got so drunk ON THE HOLY GHOST, I
[1:36:13] COULDN'T HELP from dancing. AND I GOT TO
[1:36:15] THINKING ABOUT THAT. I GOT TO THINKING
[1:36:17] ABOUT IT. IF I COULD GO OUT THERE AND I
[1:36:18] COULD DANCE FOR THE DEVIL OUT THERE ON
[1:36:20] HIS TERMS, HOW MUCH MORE COULD I DANCE
[1:36:22] WHEN I'VE BEEN RESTORED BACK TO TRUE
[1:36:24] FAITH? WHEN I GOT REAL WORSHIP, WHEN I
[1:36:26] GOT A REAL SOUL AFTER THE HEART OF GOD?
[1:36:28] SOME DEVIL DIDN'T GIVE ME A HEART TO
[1:36:30] WORSHIP? SOME DEVIL DIDN'T GIVE ME A
[1:36:32] HEART TO DANCE.
[1:36:34] SO DON'T LET SOME DEVIL PUT THAT IN YOUR
[1:36:36] MIND. WELL, YOU USED TO DO THIS AND YOU
[1:36:38] USED TO DO THAT. DO SOMETHING NOW.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; I COULD POINT IT ALL OF YOUR LIFE. YOU
[1:36:46] LIVED A FORMER LIFE, BUT THOSE THINGS
[1:36:48] ARE DEAD.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to let some Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] COME ON, SOMEBODY. I COULD DANCE OUT
[1:36:57] THERE TO 50 CENT. I COULD DANCE OUT
[1:36:58] THERE TO TUPAC. I CAN I CAN SURELY DANCE
[1:37:01] TO CHARITY GALE. I CAN SURELY DANCE TO
[1:37:04] THINGS THAT ARE TO BE. I CAN SURELY
[1:37:05] DANCE TO THE RAPTURE. I CAN SURELY DANCE
[1:37:08] TO TRUE WORSHIP OF GOD'S CHOSEN PLACE OF
[1:37:10] WORSHIP.
[1:37:24] You know, the prophet thought about it,
[1:37:26] too. He really did.
[1:37:30] He thought about it, Brother Timmy,
[1:37:33] when them women got in there and they
[1:37:36] got to singing that old song, there's
[1:37:38] going to be a meeting in the air. You
[1:37:41] remember what the prophets, and now it's
[1:37:42] a prophet, he said, they're going to
[1:37:44] turn my church into a tavern.
[1:37:50] And he said, I began to think about
[1:37:52] that. He said, "But
[1:37:56] where did dancing originate at?"
[1:38:01] He said, "I got to studying it out in my
[1:38:03] mind." And he said, "I got to figuring,"
[1:38:06] he said, "dancing originated in the
[1:38:08] Bible." He said, "So instead of being
[1:38:11] there in the seat of the scornful," he
[1:38:12] said, "Before long," he said, "my old
[1:38:14] Methodist foot got the patent."
[1:38:18] I had something about a prophet. He's
[1:38:19] real true, ain't he? He tells the truth.
[1:38:22] He he's sitting there in the seat of the
[1:38:23] scorn when he said all of a sudden he
[1:38:24] said I got to thinking about that thing.
[1:38:26] He said dancing originated in the Bible.
[1:38:31] So whatever it originated in THE BIBLE
[1:38:33] THEN SATAN COME IN THERE AND TRIED TO
[1:38:35] DESTROY IT. BUT GOD SAID I WILL RESTORE.
[1:38:40] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID I WAS SITTING IN
[1:38:42] THE SEAT OF A SCORN FOR ONE SECOND. HE
[1:38:43] SAID THE NEXT MINUTE HE SAID I WAS OUT
[1:38:45] THERE DANCING A JIG with him.
[1:38:49] HALLELUJAH. I'M THANKFUL FOR THIS
[1:38:52] MESSAGE BECAUSE I REALIZE THIS. IT PUT
[1:38:54] THE LEAF BACK ON THE TREE AGAIN.
[1:38:58] I will restore. WHAT DID THAT BIBLE WHAT
[1:39:02] DID THE BIBLE SAY ABOUT THIS PALORM? It
[1:39:04] come in there and took faith right out
[1:39:07] of the word.
[1:39:09] It stripped away their faith to make
[1:39:12] them doubt it. It ate away the church's
[1:39:16] true absolute trust in God's word.
[1:39:20] But faith cometh by hearing, and hearing
[1:39:22] by the word of God. The word of God
[1:39:26] shall stand forever. I will restore. The
[1:39:29] word of God is sharper, quicker than a
[1:39:31] two-edged sword. I will restore.
[1:39:38] Where did you get this true Christian
[1:39:40] joy at?
[1:39:44] Where did you get it at?
[1:39:48] I remember hearing
[1:39:50] Certain people say, "I always love
[1:39:52] coming to brother Homer's church."
[1:39:57] Get that right, sis.
[1:39:59] Always love coming to Brother Homer's
[1:40:01] church. Full of joy. You just knew that
[1:40:03] the Lord was really had a spirit of
[1:40:05] liberty in that church.
[1:40:07] I know good and well people come here
[1:40:09] just to just to watch us dance.
[1:40:13] We had a couple come here not too long
[1:40:15] ago
[1:40:17] and said, "We just wanted to see if it
[1:40:18] was real or not."
[1:40:21] Well, they found out it was real.
[1:40:27] We not We may not be the prettiest of
[1:40:29] Christians.
[1:40:31] And we may not be the most educated
[1:40:33] Christians, but we're real.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; We're real.
[1:40:41] They come and watch us dance. But who
[1:40:43] gave us that dance?
[1:40:46] Who gave us that joy, Brother Doug? If
[1:40:49] it come from God,
[1:40:51] then we ought to be able to enforce our
[1:40:53] rights.
[1:40:54] The joy of salvation was stripped away
[1:40:57] from the church.
[1:40:59] And I I want to implant this because I I
[1:41:01] got a lot of scriptures right here I'm
[1:41:03] about to drop to you, but I want to
[1:41:04] implant this to your mind
[1:41:06] that when God puts something on your
[1:41:08] heart to do it, you do it. And don't let
[1:41:11] no devil sit there and tell you not to
[1:41:13] do it.
[1:41:16] Is that okay?
[1:41:18] So if God give you joy, then don't let
[1:41:21] some devil try to rob it from you.
[1:41:25] Joy of salvation, heartfelt joy. Brother
[1:41:27] Brandon said, he said it was stripped
[1:41:29] away from the church and it left the
[1:41:32] church icy, cold, dead,
[1:41:36] like a morg.
[1:41:40] You ever been in a morg?
[1:41:44] Personally ain't, but I've been in some
[1:41:45] churches that look like it.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Scare you to death. I one time one time
[1:41:51] my tiny got to going to a church and uh
[1:41:54] anybody don't know who Matini is? my
[1:41:56] That's my grandma. She didn't want to be
[1:41:57] called grandma. Her name was Christine,
[1:41:59] so we called her Papa called her
[1:42:00] Christini, so we called her Tiny. And
[1:42:02] Tiny, man, I tell you what, Tiny was a
[1:42:04] powerful little lady. She She is She's
[1:42:07] big as a bowling ball, but boy, she's
[1:42:09] powerful. And she could she's one of
[1:42:12] them she's one of them real quiet
[1:42:13] prayers. And boy, I tell you what, you
[1:42:15] could feel her praying across the W. It
[1:42:17] wasn't one thing that happened at 4848
[1:42:19] Pilot Road, Pilot, Virginia. We going to
[1:42:21] start out the morning in prayer. And
[1:42:23] papa didn't care if you was in the
[1:42:25] middle of conversation. You was going to
[1:42:26] drop to your knees right there in
[1:42:26] prayer. I I remember one time Gabriel
[1:42:28] brought Gabriel brought a friend right
[1:42:30] over church uh right before church and
[1:42:31] we we sitting there and all of a sudden
[1:42:33] we're just having full-on conversation.
[1:42:35] Papa says it's time to pray.
[1:42:38] Well, praise God. Let's pray. Brother
[1:42:41] Brandham said there's too many things we
[1:42:42] could do. We could do a whole lot of
[1:42:43] this. He said, "But we can never pray
[1:42:45] too much." Well, that was one thing for
[1:42:46] sure that papa believed in was prayer.
[1:42:48] But Tiny Tiny was that kind of prayer.
[1:42:50] Papa, you could hear him. You could hear
[1:42:51] him. We always walk back to the back
[1:42:53] side of Papa's property. It wasn't that
[1:42:55] far, but it was 30 acres and walking
[1:42:57] with walking with your papa when you're
[1:42:59] a little bit 8-year-old boy walking to
[1:43:00] the back of 30 acres. You figured out
[1:43:03] that's a long way back there. And uh
[1:43:05] we'd walk back there and you could hear
[1:43:07] papa praying on the back side of that
[1:43:08] hills. It just echoed out. I I I know
[1:43:11] because one time I fell in the creek
[1:43:12] back there and you can you can hear it
[1:43:14] for a long ways away. And uh we was back
[1:43:16] there and you could hear Pawpa praying
[1:43:18] all the way on the back side of that
[1:43:19] that property. But Tini was that kind of
[1:43:21] prayer. She'd pray real quiet. Boy, you
[1:43:23] could feel her, man. You just she just
[1:43:24] rolled that neck right in bowling ball.
[1:43:27] She she full on praying. Boy, you could
[1:43:29] feel it. And all of a sudden, the spirit
[1:43:30] of God get on her and she'd just get to
[1:43:32] shouting. She'd just shout right there.
[1:43:34] She'd be sitting there at the kitchen
[1:43:35] table. Right across from her was
[1:43:37] biscuits and gravies and praise God, the
[1:43:38] Holy Ghost come there. She'd get to
[1:43:40] shouting, speaking in tongues. And she
[1:43:43] was just a real Christian. I I always
[1:43:45] aspired. There's a lot of people that
[1:43:46] want to be like some people, but if I
[1:43:48] could ever been like my teeny that's
[1:43:49] what I wanted to be. She was just she
[1:43:52] was real.
[1:43:53] Brother Wayne Lawson said he said he
[1:43:55] said when I he said, "Oh, I met brother
[1:43:57] Charlie." He said, "Huh, I don't know
[1:43:59] about I don't know about this." He said,
[1:44:01] "Then I met your deie." He said, "Well,
[1:44:02] that's where Ron gets that loving spirit
[1:44:04] from."
[1:44:10] But Tenie was just she was just real. I
[1:44:12] mean, if you never got the pre uh the
[1:44:14] the honor to meet her, you'd you'd
[1:44:16] absolutely love her. If you you never
[1:44:18] got to met her, you met Brother Ron, you
[1:44:19] met Matini. And so, but she was at this
[1:44:22] church and I tell you, she she never do
[1:44:24] anything to offend anybody. But she got
[1:44:27] to she got to sit in her and the message
[1:44:28] of the hour come across her life and
[1:44:30] spirit of God just didn't move on her.
[1:44:32] She got to dance and just dance out
[1:44:33] there right out there and she got to
[1:44:35] dancing, speaking in tongues. And the
[1:44:37] deacon of the message church come over
[1:44:38] and put tapped her on the shoulder, put
[1:44:40] her back in her seat. Well, the message
[1:44:42] kept on preaching. Thank God that wasn't
[1:44:45] around here.
[1:44:47] We' done had some deacons carry that
[1:44:49] deacon out.
[1:44:52] That's some authoritative word right
[1:44:53] there. But she got the spirit of God got
[1:44:56] to move on her again. She got back up
[1:44:58] and she did exactly what brother
[1:45:00] Brandham said in the message. She got to
[1:45:02] dancing and the deacon come up here and
[1:45:04] tapped her on the shoulder and told her
[1:45:05] to go sit down. She said, "I can't. The
[1:45:08] Holy Ghost on me." Said, "Well, you
[1:45:09] didn't get that here.
[1:45:13] God have mercy. That's a morg if I ever
[1:45:15] seen one.
[1:45:17] You know what? That was the last time
[1:45:19] they went there.
[1:45:21] But you realize how Satan hates for you
[1:45:24] to have joy.
[1:45:27] He hates for you to be happy. He hates
[1:45:30] for you to enjoy going to church.
[1:45:34] I don't know about you, but the best
[1:45:36] part of my life has been being a
[1:45:38] Christian. I'll just be real honest with
[1:45:40] you. I has a whole lot of stuff. And I
[1:45:43] did. Me and me and Sister Mary and
[1:45:45] Matthew one time we we was out there and
[1:45:47] she talked me into digging in the
[1:45:48] dumpster for some potato chips. And you
[1:45:51] thought that was the best part of my
[1:45:53] life doing something stupid. And that
[1:45:54] absolutely wasn't. But brother Matthew,
[1:45:57] I was in the dumpster the other day
[1:45:58] jumping down in there and he took a
[1:45:59] picture of me and he said, "Old habits
[1:46:01] die hard."
[1:46:08] But the best part of my life has been
[1:46:10] serving the Lord. The best part of my
[1:46:13] life has been raising my children up and
[1:46:15] rearing them up in the message of the
[1:46:16] hour. And then the enemy wants to come
[1:46:19] in there and tell you that it ain't for
[1:46:21] your children. He's What is he doing?
[1:46:24] He's trying to steal the joy of
[1:46:26] motherhood and fatherhood right out of
[1:46:28] you when you ought to be it ought to be
[1:46:30] your greatest honor to teach them the
[1:46:32] message of the hour. And there's one
[1:46:34] thing ABOUT CHILDREN IS THEY LOVE TO
[1:46:36] hear about the message, especially when
[1:46:38] it's bedtime.
[1:46:40] They don't WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND THEY
[1:46:42] WANT YOU TO break down serpent seed.
[1:46:45] And the seventh seal right before
[1:46:47] bedtime.
[1:46:49] You know, I'm I'm just being real honest
[1:46:51] with you. They That's what Satan is
[1:46:52] wanting to do. He's wanting to steal
[1:46:54] that away from our parents is where they
[1:46:56] scared to tell about the truth. They're
[1:46:58] scared that they're they're not going to
[1:47:00] say something right. They're scared.
[1:47:02] Well, you know, you better just listen
[1:47:03] to it FOR YOURSELF. NO, MAMA. IT'S YOUR
[1:47:06] JOB TO TEACH THEM. IT'S YOUR JOY TO
[1:47:08] TEACH THEM. It's your peace TO TEACH
[1:47:10] THEM. HE OUGHT TO HAVE ENOUGH FAITH THAT
[1:47:12] GOD SAVED YOU FROM A A SINNER'S GRAVE
[1:47:14] THAT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE ENOUGH JOY TO
[1:47:16] SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I MAY NOT HAVE ALL
[1:47:18] THE ANSWERS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS
[1:47:20] A GOD THAT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS."
[1:47:26] SO IF SATAN IS COMING IN THERE AFTER
[1:47:29] YOUR JOY, GOD SAID, "I WILL RESTORE."
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "RESTORE UNTO ME THE JOY OF THY
[1:47:36] SALVATION, AND UPHOLD ME WITH THY FREE
[1:47:39] SPIRIT." ROMANS 14:17, "THE KINGDOM OF
[1:47:42] GOD IS NOT MEAT AND DRINK, BUT
[1:47:44] RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE AND JOY IN THE
[1:47:47] HOLY GHOST." PETER SAID, "IT'S JOY
[1:47:49] UNSPEAKABLE AND FULL OF GLORY.
[1:47:54] Psalms 35:9, "My soul shall be joyful in
[1:47:58] THE LORD. IT SHALL REJOICE IN HIS
[1:48:00] SALVATIONS." ISAIAH 49-13, "SING, O
[1:48:04] HEAVENS, AND BE JOYFUL, O EARTH, AND
[1:48:07] BREAK FORTH INTO SINGING, OH MOUNTAINS,
[1:48:09] FOR THE LORD HATH COMFORTED HIS PEOPLE,
[1:48:11] AND WILL HAVE MERCY UPON HIS AFFLICTED."
[1:48:17] BELIEVER,
[1:48:19] do you have your joy shoes on?
[1:48:23] Now look at this caterpillar.
[1:48:27] Brother Brandham described it as a
[1:48:30] sucker.
[1:48:32] He said it gets right down. He used the
[1:48:35] word the pulp, the heart of the tree.
[1:48:39] And he said that that bug, that
[1:48:41] caterpillar goes after the life. It goes
[1:48:45] after the spirit.
[1:48:47] He said that bug represents the
[1:48:49] denomination.
[1:48:50] And he said that bug come in there and
[1:48:53] it sucked the very life of the spirit
[1:48:55] out of the tree. He said it left it as a
[1:48:57] corpse.
[1:49:00] You said there's a lot of people that
[1:49:01] walk by this bride tree.
[1:49:04] There's a lot.
[1:49:11] There's a lot of people that walk by
[1:49:12] this bride tree
[1:49:14] and they had their perspectives on it.
[1:49:17] Said she'll never be nothing. He'll
[1:49:20] never be nothing. It's dead. They don't
[1:49:23] know the story behind it. Maybe that
[1:49:25] tree was struck down by lightning or
[1:49:28] maybe it's dead and it just got no
[1:49:30] abilities. And maybe we don't know
[1:49:32] really know what happened,
[1:49:35] but they got their perspectives about
[1:49:36] you. They got their ideas about you.
[1:49:38] There's a lot of people that walk by
[1:49:40] you. But the owner of the orchard walked
[1:49:43] by. Hallelujah. And he looked at that
[1:49:46] same tree.
[1:49:47] He looked at it and it was dead. He
[1:49:50] looked at it, it had no life. He looked
[1:49:52] at it and the bark was gone. He looked
[1:49:54] at it and there was no there was no
[1:49:56] leaves on it. But he did something that
[1:50:00] the rest of the people didn't do. He got
[1:50:03] down and started digging around the
[1:50:04] roots of it. And he started opening up
[1:50:08] and he started pouring in water and he
[1:50:10] started pouring in he started pouring in
[1:50:11] attributes of himself right into that
[1:50:14] tree. And before long, he poured in
[1:50:17] justification.
[1:50:20] Under Luther's message, he poured in
[1:50:22] justification
[1:50:23] and it started coming back to life.
[1:50:27] He started coming in and wrestling. He
[1:50:28] started pouring in. He started pouring
[1:50:30] in sanctification and it started coming
[1:50:33] alive
[1:50:34] because he is the owner of this tree.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES to make
[1:50:41] her come to life again.
[1:50:47] He dug a little deeper and he started
[1:50:50] pouring in the restoration of gifts. And
[1:50:53] boy, it sure looked like the real thing
[1:50:55] again. It sure like the red look sure
[1:50:57] looked like a bride tree to him to a lot
[1:51:00] of people. But the owner of the orchard
[1:51:02] knew that it needed one more thing. It
[1:51:05] needed the owner. IT NEEDED THE OWNER OF
[1:51:09] THE ORCHARD. IT NEEDED HIS OWN LIFE. SO
[1:51:12] THE WORD BECAME THE WORD AND IT POURED
[1:51:15] ITSELF RIGHT BACK IN THAT TREE. WHAT WAS
[1:51:18] IT? IT WAS FOUR BUGS. IT WAS FOUR BUGS.
[1:51:21] IT WAS THE SAME BUG AND IT ATE IT DOWN.
[1:51:24] BUT IT WAS FOUR MESSENGERS OF
[1:51:25] RESTORATION THAT PUT LIFE BACK IN THE
[1:51:28] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD.
[1:51:32] SON OF MAN,
[1:51:34] WATCH WHAT BROTHER BENHAM DOES IN
[1:51:36] RESTORATION OF THE BRRIER. HE SAID IT
[1:51:38] WAS FOUR MESSENGERS OF DEATH. HE SAID,
[1:51:40] "BUT NOW IT'S FOUR MESSENGERS OF LIFE."
[1:51:42] HE SAID, "BUT SON OF MAN, CAN THESE
[1:51:44] BONES LIVE AGAIN?"
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; I SAY, "SATAN, TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF OF
[1:51:50] GOD'S PROPERTY."
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; What did MOSES DO? HE WENT DOWN THERE
[1:51:56] BEFORE PHARAOH. HE SAID, "YOU LET MY
[1:51:59] PEOPLE GO. LET THEM GO. LET THEM GO."
[1:52:02] EVERY PLAGUE WAS GOD'S LAW.
[1:52:07] Let my people,
[1:52:17] what is it?
[1:52:20] Turn to Isaiah 59-19, please.
[1:52:31] There's a lot of people that's looked at
[1:52:33] your life
[1:52:36] He wrote you off.
[1:52:38] There's a lot of people that looked at
[1:52:39] you
[1:52:44] and he saw dirty waters, but God saw
[1:52:46] clear waters.
[1:52:51] One brother man knew when he takes us to
[1:52:54] Zechariah 14 and said that it shall be
[1:52:58] light about the evening time. He said,
[1:53:02] "The same light that was in the morning
[1:53:04] is the same light that's in the
[1:53:06] evening." He said, "What did the evening
[1:53:09] light return for?" He said, "To restore
[1:53:12] the church." So the light has the same
[1:53:17] abilities.
[1:53:19] Notice what he said. So shall they fear
[1:53:22] the name of the Lord from the west
[1:53:28] and his glory from the rising of the
[1:53:31] sun. WHEN THE ENEMY SHALL COME IN like a
[1:53:35] flood, the spirit of the Lord shall
[1:53:38] raise up a standard against him. WHO IS
[1:53:42] THAT HIM? IT IS THAT OLD DEVIL THAT'S
[1:53:45] TRIED TO COME IN THERE AND STEAL YOUR
[1:53:47] JOY AND STEAL YOUR PEACE AND STEAL YOUR
[1:53:49] DOCTRINE AND STEAL YOUR ABSOLUTE AND
[1:53:52] STEAL YOUR GOD AND STEAL WHAT YOU'VE
[1:53:54] BEEN RIGHTFULLY GIVEN. BUT WHEN THE
[1:53:56] SPIRIT OF THE ENEMY COMES IN THERE, THE
[1:53:59] SPIRIT OF THE LORD RAISES UP A STANDARD
[1:54:02] AGAINST IT. WHAT IS THAT STANDARD? IT'S
[1:54:05] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:54:11] NOW, you know, I I'm done. I'm
[1:54:15] completely done.
[1:54:20] Not done with assault. I'm not done with
[1:54:22] I will restore, but I'm done for today.
[1:54:25] As your musicians come,
[1:54:27] you know good and well what's been taken
[1:54:29] from you,
[1:54:31] David. You know what the enemy has taken
[1:54:32] from you.
[1:54:35] There it is. You know what he's taken
[1:54:37] from you. You know what he's robbed away
[1:54:40] from you? David, it's time to go down to
[1:54:42] Ziglad and take what's rightfully yours.
[1:54:47] Matt, would you mind singing that for
[1:54:49] us?
[1:54:53] There's somebody that's going to control
[1:54:55] that spirit.
[1:55:03] Let's have some joy.
[1:55:06] Let's have some worship.
[1:55:08] Let's have some peace. Let's have our
[1:55:10] anointing. Let's have what is rightfully
[1:55:14] ours.
[1:55:16] Amen. God bless you.
[1:55:21] Well, I'm taking it back.
[1:55:24] Everything that the devil stole from me.
[1:55:27] Well, I'm taking it back.

[1:56:15] Now one day, oh king David came home
[1:56:19] from the city calls it lie. And while he
[1:56:23] was gone, the enemy came stole
[1:56:26] everything that he had. Oh, but David
[1:56:30] encouraged himself to the Lord. He made
[1:56:33] up in his mind. He said, "I'm on my way
[1:56:37] down to his king and I'm taking my
[1:56:40] property back. I'm taking it back.
[1:56:45] Everything that the devil stole from me,
[1:56:48] I'm taking it back.

[1:56:55] Taking back my soul, my taste, my joy,
[1:57:01] and my peace. I'm taking it back.
[1:57:05] Everything that the devil stole me. Now
[1:57:10] we all know what Satan only comes. Steal
[1:57:14] to kill and destroy. And I must admit,
[1:57:18] there's been some times that he's taken
[1:57:20] away my joy. Oh, but I'm certainly

[1:57:42] I'm taking it back.

[1:57:55] and my peace, I'm taking it back.

[1:58:02] that second verse again. Oh, we all know
[1:58:06] Satan only comes to steal, to kill, and
[1:58:09] destroy him. Oh, and I must admit,
[1:58:12] there's been some times he's taken away
