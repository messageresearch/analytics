TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] see how we can rest upon his word then no matter how hard the storm flows what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon the word amen god said it you've seen the other side of the storm so if you're sickest anchor your soul in the haven of rest if you're perplexed and distressed remember he said i'll be with you always even to the end of it and he's he said all things work together for good to them and love the lord so just stay right there one man wrote a poet wrote my anchor holds within the veil what is a veil is something that shuts off here from there and the anchor is on the inside of the veil you don't see how it's going to be but you know that there's something that's got a hold of you that's got to hold up there and when the sea is blowing and starving has ever i guess maybe somebody has never been privileged to see a ship anchored oh my i wrote them on it throughout a sea anchor like that until the little craft couldn't even go over the top the the wave it would go through the way but as long as the anchor helps that's all makes any difference whether we go over underground or through it doesn't matter the anchor hole that's the way when storms of life begin to shake us we may have to go through and they have to go over under around but just let the anchor hole within the veil to the unseen we don't know just exactly where it's at but it's a holding just like the little boy you know that had the kite you've heard the old proverb the story said how do you know you got a coyote in there so i can still feel it tugging so that's it if we can feel it still tugging god dealing with our hearts then we know our anchor still holds i believe it was benjamin franklin who caught the lightning in the bottle who harnessed lightning electricity something within him called and said there's power in that that power could be harnessed and if it's that powerful to shoot the streaks and the bursts of timbers split over the ground what could it do if it was once harnessed it'll lighten flesh and hit the whole earth and benjamin franklin i believe fishing on his kite with a key tied on the end of the tail of a bottle down at the bottom and when he got it he didn't know what he had but he began to scream i got it i got it he didn't know what it was he didn't know what he was going to do with it but he know he had something and that's the way with every man that's hopes are built on nothing less than jesus blood with righteousness all around my soul gives way then he's all my hope and state on christ's solid rock i stand all other grounds is sinking sins once born again the holy spirit takes its place into the heart some young people may not are young or maybe illiterate no matter how it is there's no one can explain it so don't feel bad because you're illiterate you couldn't explain it there's never been a man yet could explain it no matter how smart or high intelligent it's god's own secret amen but when that word takes life in your heart you see it you scream i got it you don't know what you're going to do with it you don't know what it's going to do with you but you know something's happened amen and you got it do [Music] [Applause]

and there's nothing can stand in the way of a saint going to meet the promise of god death can't stop it the grave can't stop it the devil can't stop it the devil can't stop it the devil can't stop it the devil can't stop it i want to make sure he heard it [Applause] we are more than conquerors sickness is conquered for you friends death is conquered for you unbeliever won't you receive him habits has been conquered for you temptation's been conquered you say i have got a temper i can't get over it it's conquered it's already conquered the great final seed of abraham there's no more conquering to do now he's conquered it for us and we by his grace through his promise just believe and hold on that's what that's all we do it's already finished our sickness our transgressions he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed [Applause] hallelujah psalms 118 and verse 22 believe we're going to have church the stone which the builders refused is become the head of the corner this is the lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the lord hath made and we will rejoice and be glad in it let's read it together again this morning this is the day which the lord hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it may the lord bless the reading of his word amen you might be seated in john 18 33 then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews and jesus answered him sayest thou this of thyself or did others tell it thee of me and pilate answered am i a thine jew nation and chief priests have delivered thee unto me what has thou done now jesus answers a powerful statement right here and jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world i'd like to say that this is not the world that i'm a citizen of [Applause] my kingdom is not of this world and if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence brother tim pruitt sent me this this morning and and i i thought it was too good to just keep to myself and so i'm gonna i'm going to share it with you and this was his thoughts this morning as he awoke my god is awesome he's the maker of the whole world he's awesome awesome my god is awesome he can heal the body of any cancer brain bleed or disease is awesome my god is awesome he's awesome awesome awesome he's mighty oh he's mighty yes he's mighty he's awesome my god is awesome he can heal a deaf child that's supposed to that wasn't supposed to hear oh my god is awesome he's awesome he's awesome praise god he's awesome he said i woke up this morning with this on my mind and i added words because that's how awesome my god is he can heal cancer brain lead bleeds other sicknesses and disease he can heal and make a little boy who was never supposed to hear without a hearing device and take that hearing aid off and when he began to sing that song he said jesus told me to take it off because i can hear now i don't need this anymore glory to god that was the last sunday in june of 2020 and he's been without it since [Applause] hallelujah so you see if god can heal a deaf child he could heal a man with brain cancer who was only given four months to live a year ago and he's still walking talking today because he's as far as i know cancer free if he can heal a woman that was given five minutes to five years to live but if she did live she would have been a vegetable stage the rest of her life because of that brain bleed yet this woman wasn't in the hospital as long as they expected knows she was in there just for a very short time and is walking talking miracle her name is karen pruitt imagine what god can do for you he wrote that personally to me but i i want to say it to the world imagine what god can do for you now let's talk about a little bit about our god he conquered sickness he conquered temptation when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw he turned the other side just a few moments we sung about a champion this is our champion this is who i am identified with tonight when they jerked this beard from his face and spit on him he never reviled back he conquered the gate of temptation he took it then you say my temper won't let me do it he said you seed of abraham he he can conquer it for you when he reviled when he was reviled upon he reviled not back when he was made fun of he held his peace when he was called the devil he held his peace he had one business that was the father's business and he went about doing that and then finally they they took him to a cross and death had to face him all of the rest of them had conquered seas they'd conquered nature they conquered lines they conquered fire they had conquered everything but death but here was one beating in his brain his veins that they that had conquered the death so they took his hands and stretched him out and nailed him to a cross and they beat him and they stripped him till his bones started him but when he did they'd done all that they could do for him death struck him and said now i'll take you like i did joshua i'll take you like i did daniel and i'll do all this because i'll make you die but i've got news for you this morning death don't hold him hallelujah death don't hold him today he is not in a tomb hallelujah he is not dead but he is very much alive a friend of mine named tim nunnweiler sent me a note this week he said i was listening to general norman schwarzkopf he was a general over the gulf war and he was talking about what makes an effective army it's not the technology it's not the number of soldiers he said he looks at two different things when evaluating an army dedication to the cause the will to fight they are the more important than everything else and tim tim nunnwaller wrote me this he said i thought of another general you he said there's a tiger behind your eyes i would say satan saw that tiger it's more than a spencer tiger it's a god tiger he said in god's invincible army only we have much more we have the best weapon that there is too in the middle of a sermon and it's you know sometimes you're sitting in a service and all of a sudden there's a quote that just begins and brother brandon would just fall into a spot and then god would just amen god and he would just fall into a spot and god just don't amen sometimes you're sitting in a service yourselves and all of a sudden the word that is a very discerner of the heart all of a sudden you realize he's at your spot and you're just exposed and you're just you're just allowing the word now change my life and you're just sitting there now change my life come and consume me oh god brother man says now i'm going to pray for you the bible said that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and god shall raise them up and if i found grace in the blessed god may may this be the the night that you'll never forget may the holy spirit come into every heart just now and just move out everything and all the sickness from the body now watch what he does now i i now challenge the devil to a debate hallelujah hallelujah this was more than a prophet amen this was more than a man but this was under the administration of the son of man in this age are you with me this is more than just probing at the word and guessing at the word but in full authority i now challenge the devil to a debate two worlds standing against one another satan you're aware that you're whipped you have no legal rights jesus christ my lord stripped you of every authority that you had and when he died at calvary to take away sin and sickness and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff you know that when our lord came to the tree he cursed the tree and the next day it was withering and our lord said to his disciples have faith in god for if you say ye shall say to the mountain be removed don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said is coming to pass and you can have what you said now watch what he does now satan you know the scripture on that so what he is doing he's actually calling satan to a debate and reminding him you were there and you were a witness to it did it happen or didn't it happen did he have the power or didn't he have a power to do it and he said i just had i just taught this people that god is in them i've just preached this sermon that god is in them i want to remind you that god is in you if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you god is in them and if god is in them and they speak to that disease and say be away from me and don't doubt in their heart right then that disease has to move for christ said so for it's not them that speaks it's the father that dwells in them that's speaking they're in need so come out of them in the name of jesus christ i say as god servant by a message of an angel who who anointed and and has proved to the people that jesus is here and the message is right so come out of them in the name of jesus christ i adore you to leave every sick person and get into outer darkness in the name of the lord jesus christ and a roar of wind went through the building and a roar of wind went through the building brethren says that was him that was him you see got to back his word up so i on that i'd like to take just a little bit of a theme this morning and stir satan's memory i like to stir his memory just a little bit if you'll remember there was a before and after many times in the scriptures the before man the testimony and then the after satan i'd like to take you to abraham's tent you obviously was there you're not said in the scripture but you was obviously there because you watch those lights come from out of heaven and step into a body and you watch melchizedek and the two angels come and sit at the tent and you know that that was the voice that came out of that body was the same voice that had been talking to abraham now for years and we would say just about 20 years it was that same voice because abraham called him lord elohim and he and he began to talk lip to ear to god himself now god had made him a promise and that promise now was some 20-some years passed and now abraham had been testifying i'm going to have a son and he testified his neighbors had heard about it i'm going to have a son the older he got the more impossible that it was but it wasn't up to abraham to produce the promise it's up to god to produce the promise it isn't up to us to produce the rapture of the resurrection it's up to god to do it and he'll do it exactly like he said it would do it's up to us to believe him and take him at his word oh brother ron but i don't understand it doesn't make a difference whether you understand it or not just take him at his word and believe it with all your hearts [Applause] hallelujah i just want to take just a glimpse here just for a moment you've been abraham's neighbor for years you've lived in the tent just right down from him now you're journeying with him abraham walked into his tent the night before an old man grey-headed stupid shoulders and this morning he walks out young now sarah she walked into that same tent an old woman but the next morning she walks out young and a matter of fact she is so beautiful till the king wants to have her as his wife that was a mystery under the seven seals brother branham said that god held that for literally hundreds and thousands of years and some of the greatest philosophers and preachers in the world had never caught the mystery but god transformed their body to meet the challenge of the hour that same god has the power to transform not just abraham and sarah's body but a universal rapture around the world graves will give way the sea will give way all the way back to the ashes and the gases we'll step from that dimension into this dimension there moses stood with a rod in his hand that same rod that swallowed snakes now stretches out across a red sea when the enemy looked like he was going to destroy them let me just remind you of the scripture and when pharaoh drew nothing the children of israel lifted up their eyes and beheld the egyptian marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou melt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone may we serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptian then we would die in this wilderness how quickly circumstances would change your faith if you're not careful why would you bring that scripture up there's a lot of people has melted under the pressure of stage four cancer there's a lot of people that's melted under a lot less circumstances than what you fight but something keeps holding you when you can't hold yourself i don't care how how much the devil whispers in your ear it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible but one day abraham stepped out of the tent a young man he just held onto the promise that god made to him he looked him in the eyes he had heard his voice but he knew one day god would perform his word moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today you shall see them again no more forever [Laughter] let it sink in satan do you remember that do you remember that day surely you remember abraham coming out of the tent young surely surely you remember those egyptians coming down on them those people that look like the worst bloodbath in the whole world surely you remember that surely you remember what happened in just a little bit the sea opened up it opened up and those people went across on dry land oh yeah the scoffers said well it was just a reeve that they walked across well isn't that something the greatest army in the whole world drowned in your excuse hallelujah [Applause] you want to give me an excuse of that it didn't happen the greatest army in the whole world drowned let me tell you about scoffers let me tell you about critics they hung around an ark just in case they hung around an ark just in case they listened to a preacher for 120 years and they made fun of him they built their own hearts and one day the god shut the door and day after day they made fun of them but there come a time that they believe the message [Music] oh they believe the message they believe the message when the heavens opened up and the villas of the deep opened up but moses couldn't reach out and save them because god had sent them a message to get inside of the ark listen world god sent this world a message you're hanging on the fringes oh one day i'm gonna run in when los angeles let me just say the rapture is already in progress there's more than cancer leaving this body there's a rapture that's happening to it molecule after molecule is taking place this mortal's going to take on immortality and we're going to be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye maybe his memory is not as good as it should be so maybe satan's got dementia so we just kind of bring him up a little bit the girl named georgia carter was laid in a bed for over nine years tortured by a disease and she got a hold of a book of the promises of god and she believed for herself that she could be healed and god sent a prophet god sent a prophet to where she was at and there was a lot of people that was against it but god sent a prophet there for that little girl i want to remind you satan she didn't lay in that bed no longer after he arrived [Applause] but she went out into the grass and began to pick the grass and the flowers and smell the flowers rolling the grass then she went in and played the piano [Applause] i want to remind you that god not only sent that prophet to to down to milltown but he sent him to memphis by the way of grounding an airplane because a woman had a meat you know sometimes we think about brother branham and god speaking to brother branham and speaking of squirrels into existence or storm out of existence but let me just take a take it to the believer here's a woman that had never heard brother branham speak she didn't know he was a prophet she knew nothing about what he was what he stood for but she prayed a prayer where's my elijah [Applause] are you with me and brother branham said to brother bischoff and we're going to borrow it he said that woman created that storm that's how much power that you have and brother adam starts walking going to put some mail in and starts walking and the angel said just walk and gives him instructions and he's going mind singing a little tune and he goes back good morning annie good morning parson how did you know i was a parson early this morning i was praying where's my elijah her boy was dying dying of a disease and he she walked in brother branham walks in behind her he called it a small house shanty at one place and he says said he looked around there's pictures of jesus on the wall and he that's what brother random did he says won't you pray won't you pray a whole lot different than a lot of these modern day evangelists don't you pray brother joe i love this part brother branham said i've been in four castles in the world they say brother branham never did go pray for king george but history tells us different tells us different brother bill i mean you've conversed over this many times and me and you brother joe's been heard so many times king george went and played golf the next day after brother brown prays for him brother branham said it he said i've been in four castles and he said i've never felt more comfortable than in that home he said she knew jesus let that sink let that sink you know a couple of years ago within a week i stood in tiananmen square in china and then i went into the forbidden city brother tom ray and brother murphy wong but they took me to an apartment where a little woman got down on her knees in front of us right there and she said i never dreamed i'd get to meet you in person i'm so glad to have you in my home woman probably about 60 couple years old her prayers put us there be with me i'll never forget that time listen within a week i'm standing in the oval office but brother tim pruitt and brother mike walls say brother ron but this message is just for a little corner you've come way too late to tell me that business you've come way too late to tell me that business the most powerful people on the earth is the people that we preach to because somewhere you step from another dimension out of eternity into time and the seed of god which you possess was with him before the foundation of the world and it's in you now [Applause] and i want to remind you that satan cannot touch you he cannot destroy you until god's purpose has been fulfilled i feel like shouting and running all over this building hallelujah [Applause] houston debate you remember that you remember that brother and said i'll just well he was instructed to stay in the balcony and he stayed there until the angel nudged him to go on down and as he walked down that little prophet of god as he walked down he came to the stage brother bran was no cocky man he was a very much a gentleman and as a matter of fact if you go back and read brother branham actually made great statements about dr best they said that was a strange thing about brother branham they couldn't tell his enemies from his friends oh that god would so fill our lives oh that god would so fill our lives that's why they made a god out of him they were wrong in doing that but that's why they saw so much god in him until they made a god out of him may that be a live inside of us just a bit of brandon begins to talk about how many has been healed in the meeting this week just thousands of hands begin to go up and he makes a few statements and a whirl starts coming through the building that pillar of fire that picture that hangs in most of our homes that picture of that pillar of fire hangs there hangs in our best view now i'm not ashamed to be identified with that i'm not a bit ashamed to be identified with that i'm not ashamed to be identified with wigan branham but more than that i'm not ashamed to be identified with that pillar of fire because it's here now the other day in the dream brother brown said would you like to have your picture taken with me i'm not ashamed to be identified whether it's in a dream or whether it's in a vision or whether it's in flesh i'm not ashamed of this message well you're following a man well who are you following and where is he taking you you left the message and now you go to a bar you left the message and now you're a prostitute you left the message and now you're divorced [Applause] come on church you left the message and now you drink wine and you drink whiskey and you're doing drugs and you don't believe in god no more who are you following [Applause] i choose to follow jesus 42 inch grizzly uh 42 inch caribou exactly and still is exactly silver tip grizzly bear brother branham i can't see him are you doubting the vision but no sir no sir what's that out there there he is three squirrels what are you hunting for go to the place that you call sportsman holler three squirrels speak exactly where they're at they ate them sister branham getting ready to have surgery speak the word did it happen or didn't it happen the possum on the porch did it happen or didn't it happen the little dog at charlie cox's house that had just been run over and brother brown said y'all go in the house y'all go in the house and when they all went in the house brother bam took his hat off and when he put his hat back on his head he snapped his fingers and the dog ran in the house in front of him what about that the animal the horse that was wild and brother biscuit is standing there and they begin to he begins to explain that he's going to kill somebody he's going to kill somebody and brother branham just he said all of a sudden that horse just settled down and it became completely calm and he said i looked out of the corner of my eye and he said i saw brother brown putting his hat back on and he said i realized that he could control nature amen not he but the god inside of him was on display you know sometimes dementia causes you not to remember decades ago so maybe we is it okay if we just bring it a little more current yeah one of my best friends brother donnie reagan his daughter got cancer we prayed we prayed all we can do is pray and we prayed and she she went for treatment after treatment and weary or out because of the treatments and there came a moment to where the doctors examined her and did the test on her and said you're you're cancer-free you can ring the bell i want to tell you the other day when i got the picture of her ringing the bell i danced i said this week or last week sister susan hershberger the doctors told her she had rectal tumor rectal cancer they've been treating her we've been praying well it was the treatments really really well brother ron i you know it's not a miracle if you have to go to a doctor you're just of the devil you're just a demon spirit living inside of a human piece of clay that denies the miracle working hand of god listen i pray for my doctors i pray for the medicine that i put in that medicine's powerful listen listen the medicine i took this morning and and i'll take this afternoon is a is the highest form of chemo that they can give me it costs 483 dollars a dose so i take near a thousand dollars of medicine a day are you with me but somewhere god allowed them to have the ability to reach into that realm to give me help are you with me let me just bring it to you and sister susan got report this week you're cancer-free [Applause] you're cancer-free her husband is a minister of the gospel with brother danny steeman sister seuss and his brother danny's sister hallelujah hallelujah and he stood in the pulpit with his wife with a death sentence on her and preached god's a healer god's a healer that's a healer little lady elena blacks with tumor and her her lungs blackened with cancer hallelujah satan do you remember you're the one that put it on her but you didn't have enough you'd like to took her life but you didn't have enough one night in a church service like this one right here she was sitting in the balcony and and they began to sing leaning on the everlasting arms and she had been tortured she had been going through treatment after treatment and she was sitting there so weakened in her body and death is swirling that bee of death is swirling around her that thing that's trying to kill her and kill her body and she don't sit there crying in her mully grubs she gets up and starts dancing all the way around that building running the next day she goes for x-rays you can see it it's it's in it's in video form you can see it on your internet gone gum gone mariah her hair was leaving day after day hair's leaving a disease is sitting in her body she's becoming bald well i know there's tens of thousands in the world that have that disease but satan afflicted a child of god now it makes a difference when you're a child of god because you have authority in heaven more authority than an archangel so let's remember let's not pity ourself or feel sorry here we have a position let's remind ourselves of who we really are god tells us service after service after service of who you are you've just got to believe it and it's not your words it's god's words take him at his word and the most supernatural thing about you is your tongue let it come from your heart and across your lips and your confession is made i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed she walked into a prayer line with three bobby pins believing i'm gonna get well now satan let me remind you you remember you was there sitting at the well watching abraham testify i'm gonna have a son and you laughed and no doubt when she walked into that prayer line she had those three bobby pins you laughed again but i want you to take a picture of her today [Applause] she's got a full head of hair and it's beautiful and it's growing because god restored the glory back to her that's what he's done to the bride of jesus christ he has restored the glory what denominations tried to take out for seven dispensations he has restored the glory sister connie sitting here and i was there i was standing beside of the doctor when he's running a scope down into her lungs and there's the there's the pictures there's three there was three different computer screens and he's running the scope into her lungs he was talking about a horrible procedure but he's running a scope into her lungs sarcoidosis had filled her lungs it's like a sand that gets into your lungs and i was standing there when that young doctor looked over at me and he said preacher you must pray if this is cancer she's got about two weeks to live two nurses grabbed me because all the sudden i didn't have the strength to stand up they carried me into a waiting room and i sat in a corner and i sat there and i had never did this in my life but i put my head between my knees because i was somewhere between sick and satan was shaking me then i ride back and remembered who i was and sister connie walked through prayer line after prayer and i'd like to report to the devil it's in remission sister karen i know you're watching not just one brain bleed but another one the second one which would tilt her head her brain even to to one side and they would tell her husband that it would he would have a vegetable for a wife the rest of her life if she should live no doctors are not mean they're just telling you what they see and they're prepping you they're prepping my doctors pray for me they're caring doctors they're they're very caring doctor if you go to a doctor that's meaner than a junkyard dog you don't have to stay with him go get you another one get you a god-fearing doctor are you with me get your doctor that cares about you you got a preacher that don't care about you get you another one are you whistling you heard you heard brother andrew last night say we'll fight for you we're spencers but we'll fight for you because we're sons of god brother tim i'm fighting for you this morning how dare that enemy pick on my buddy how dare him pick on you as a child of god raise your sword cut his head off remind him to go back to hell [Applause] brother on you shouldn't be say that go to hell satan needs to go to hell that's his home so just tell him go back to hell hallelujah they had to shave sister karen's head but today she's got beautiful hair it's curly it's got good color to it her smile is back and that glimmer eyes of mischievousness is back in our eyes again it's those things that make you special the devil may have sent you through every torture chamber in the world but when you come out on the other side [Applause] hallelujah they asked a man that had been in vietnam a p.o.w they asked him what brought you through he said god brought me through and he said i realized that as i'm going through all of this torture i'm going to be better on the other side listen if a man in a pow camp can say that i'm going to be better on the other side i'm going to live through this i'm going to get through this and i'm going to be a better man on the other side come on church listen not a man whispered in my ear but god whispered in my ear if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before [Applause] isaac must be in he's out hallelujah that's good for you but isaac is more than a myth he's more than we want to have a baby it's impossible the doctors say it's impossible to have a baby but isaac's sleeping on the back pew this morning because god said so no matter what your situation is no matter if the devil is whispered in your ear it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible it's impossible god said something different hallelujah you were pre-planned before the foundation of the world you were more than the myth or more than the thought you were pre-planned by god god the infinite god knowed all about it he had to know every flea that would ever ever be on the earth how many times a bat would bat its eyes our in our little minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite god he knowed all things therefore nothing is out of cada brother ron but in my situation where's god i'll tell you where god's at he's holding you he's got a hold of you in the midst of your darkest trial when you say i give up he's got a hold of you go ahead and let loose you ain't going nowhere god's got a hope to you brother ron i'm just going to walk away go ahead go ahead if your seat of god you can't walk away as a matter of fact if you're a seed of god and you have walked away god's on your trail and he'll not lose a one of you are you with me now god's got a plan in it's way bigger than your plans [Applause] now i want to remind you satan you're defeated you're defeated you're defeated i want to remind you that god's just not going to hold heal the cancer it's going to change my body but i won't remind you i'm not alone i'm not alone i don't know what you're going to do with this church maybe make a storehouse out of it museum or whatever but there's neighbors that live next door like they did abraham said well they were just there last week [Laughter] well they're probably like that jim jones they went off to guyana somewhere and they go drink some kool-aid i just hear the excuses i just hear the excuses you know they say well we don't need as much church as those people need you know we believe in god there they go up that hill again they're gonna go up that hill again you can hear them up there singing and shouting and you can hear that preacher screaming what happened to them people i don't know but i heard in that sermon they was going to take a rapture some people on the internet remind me a whole lot about like noah's people they're listening to these sermons because they know it's right come on you don't you didn't stayed on the internet long enough let me talk to you now you know it's right but because you won't swallow your pride and won't surrender yourself to the word of god you'll hang outside the ark just in case but i want to let you know we're leaving [Laughter] we're leaving we're leaving i'm not done but maybe i can finish it kind of like this remind me going over a few testimonies real quick real quick i've already went over them but i want to go over them real quick so elena blutz believed she went to church though the cancer was still there but she knew it was leaving and now it's gone and mariah combed her hair it became bald and she kept going to church and she carried her bobby pins because she knew she's going to have hair again and now she's got hair and karen pruitt is sitting now listen
