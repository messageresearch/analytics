[1:03:43] lose he didn't pick you to be an example
[1:03:46] of what a failure
[1:03:47] is he picked you to be an overcomer
[1:03:53] [Applause]
[1:03:57] Hallelujah now overcoming means that
[1:04:00] you're going to have to fight with
[1:04:02] things and wrestle with things
[1:04:04] and you're going to have to be in some
[1:04:09] battles there are no perfect
[1:04:15] days tell your neighbor there are no
[1:04:18] perfect
[1:04:21] days I find it amazing that you and I
[1:04:24] need vacation
[1:04:30] I I I enjoy vacations I really do I
[1:04:33] enjoy
[1:04:34] it I like
[1:04:38] vacations but the devil never takes a
[1:04:41] day
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:44] off so no matter where you go top of the
[1:04:46] mountain down to the beach wherever you
[1:04:52] go I find that that we escape from our
[1:04:55] normal little world and we go to a place
[1:04:58] to where we find that we're going to get
[1:05:00] some peace and Harmony and some quiet
[1:05:03] time and a million other
[1:05:08] people have the same
[1:05:13] idea and you're standing in a line
[1:05:15] behind a thousand
[1:05:22] people vacation
[1:05:27] so God called you to use you he sent the
[1:05:32] greatest message in the world to you of
[1:05:36] all of the generations he gave you the
[1:05:39] best message that he could give
[1:05:43] you this message from all the way from
[1:05:46] 49 all the way to the end and
[1:05:49] continuation with the greatest preachers
[1:05:51] there are on the Earth all over the
[1:05:54] world new New Zealand's a good example
[1:05:57] Australia All Over The
[1:05:59] World God has armed men of God to be
[1:06:03] cheerleaders in front of audience and
[1:06:05] congregation we can
[1:06:08] overcome we're going to win here God's
[1:06:12] going to have a bride we're going to
[1:06:14] stand on streets of
[1:06:18] gold we're not going to be defeated and
[1:06:21] Men of God all over the world stand to
[1:06:24] Their audience whether it's small or
[1:06:27] large and they stand there and scream
[1:06:30] and cheer the people on and take the
[1:06:33] word of
[1:06:35] God notice heavens and earth will pass
[1:06:41] away are you with me but his
[1:06:46] word uh when you think about heavens and
[1:06:49] earth passing away but his words will
[1:06:52] never pass
[1:06:53] away now let remember remember this a
[1:06:56] Believer is one that takes the word of
[1:07:00] God and speaks it and go
[1:07:04] forward sometimes we get the idea that
[1:07:08] that that we're standing alone but God
[1:07:11] never tells you to do
[1:07:15] something and then not back it
[1:07:20] up are you with me he gives a vision
[1:07:22] then you believe the vision and then you
[1:07:25] walk walk into
[1:07:26] it none of us have been asked to build a
[1:07:29] boat that all the animals can get
[1:07:33] in but one man had to take God at his
[1:07:36] word and work on an ark for 120
[1:07:40] years and everybody said it's not going
[1:07:43] to
[1:07:44] rain everybody said well you know what a
[1:07:47] horrible Ark that you're building it
[1:07:49] won't
[1:07:50] float just give God time
[1:07:57] amen Moses stood there before one of the
[1:08:00] greatest bloodbaths that was ever going
[1:08:02] to take
[1:08:03] place with the children of Israel behind
[1:08:06] him believing the
[1:08:09] message that he had been preaching now
[1:08:11] this time and they had seen the plagues
[1:08:14] and they had seen the signs and wonders
[1:08:17] and the greatest army in the world had
[1:08:19] turned them loosen now there's going to
[1:08:21] be a blood
[1:08:24] bath and he be to cry out to God and God
[1:08:29] as God asked him why are you crying out
[1:08:31] to
[1:08:33] me speak and go
[1:08:37] forward do we really think that this
[1:08:40] message has brought us to this
[1:08:43] spot I'm challenging you now do we
[1:08:46] really think that God has brought us to
[1:08:48] this spot before resurrection and
[1:08:52] Rapture for it to not take place
[1:08:55] [Music]

[1:12:14] command these stones to be made
[1:12:16] bread but he answered and said it is
[1:12:21] written brother random said he did not

[1:13:21] the enemy shall come in like a
[1:13:24] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[1:13:28] up a standard against

[1:13:34] respond don't you worry God will respond
[1:13:38] to your
[1:13:41] situation 2 Corinthians chapter 10 and
[1:13:44] verse three for though we walk in the
[1:13:46] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[1:13:49] the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:13:52] carnal But Mighty through the pulling
[1:13:55] down of strongholds casting down every
[1:13:58] imagination and every High thing that
[1:14:01] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[1:14:03] God and bringeth into captivity every
[1:14:06] thought to The Obedience of
[1:14:13] Christ brother brandham answers a Critic
[1:14:16] how do you feel brother brandham when
[1:14:18] you stand there and you see the people
[1:14:20] coming out in different languages and
[1:14:22] things are you afraid no sir
[1:14:27] no sir he told me he told me so he said
[1:14:34] so never been afraid
[1:14:37] Yet brother Brandon's been in some
[1:14:40] spots cuse he told me
[1:14:43] so and I believe it's the
[1:14:49] truth notice these words if he told me
[1:14:52] tonight to go to the presidential
[1:14:55] graveyard and raise up George Washington
[1:14:58] tomorrow morning I'd invite the whole
[1:15:03] world come and see it
[1:15:05] done bring every get every critic that
[1:15:10] you can to stand them around and you're
[1:15:12] going to see the glory of God set that
[1:15:15] chair over there over here and where
[1:15:18] that you can sit down and rest a little
[1:15:20] while and he'll be here in just a few
[1:15:23] moments
[1:15:28] I noticed last night yesterday I
[1:15:30] struggled I I studied all week as we do
[1:15:33] and studied all we week and yesterday
[1:15:35] morning I got up and it was
[1:15:40] gone oh Lord oh lord it's gone so I I
[1:15:46] studied in this room and I studied in
[1:15:48] that room and I studed over here finally
[1:15:51] I took a
[1:15:53] walk and I said well I'm going to go
[1:15:55] back to where I I got the inspiration so
[1:15:59] I walked in I sat down on a certain
[1:16:01] chair and I was sitting there and it
[1:16:02] begin to
[1:16:04] flow wow wow why did all this happen
[1:16:07] then when Andrew was preaching last
[1:16:09] night I thought me and him are preaching
[1:16:12] the same
[1:16:14] sermons and he's going first and I hope
[1:16:17] he leaves me something over in the
[1:16:23] maps but you know he begin to say
[1:16:26] there's going to be a miracle here
[1:16:28] tonight there's going to be a miracle
[1:16:30] here
[1:16:33] tonight and no doubt the enemy I heard
[1:16:36] you say it the enemy gets in your
[1:16:39] face whenever you you step out on
[1:16:43] faith whenever you walk out in the
[1:16:47] water when you step out in the Red
[1:16:52] Sea can you imagine how many people
[1:16:55] heard brother brandom say this if God
[1:16:58] told me to go raise George
[1:17:01] Washington can you imagine what the
[1:17:04] backlash in that audience
[1:17:08] was but I also heard brother Andrew say
[1:17:11] something last night that's in my notes
[1:17:14] there's another Elijah
[1:17:17] coming there's another one coming you
[1:17:20] miss this one in Gentiles but there's
[1:17:23] another one coming
[1:17:25] but it's not to
[1:17:26] you it's to the
[1:17:30] Jews and listen you and I have to take a
[1:17:34] Rapture so he and Moses can
[1:17:38] come there's 144,000 Jews that's got to
[1:17:43] hear the message of the
[1:17:46] hour so we've got to take a rapure
[1:17:49] there's got to be events
[1:17:52] happen well brother Ron I don't believe
[1:17:54] believe brother Brandon was a prophet I
[1:17:56] don't believe he was Elijah well you
[1:17:58] won't believe that there's going to be
[1:18:00] Elijah in Israel
[1:18:02] either if you can't believe this one you
[1:18:04] won't believe that one are you getting
[1:18:07] where I'm
[1:18:09] at so the devil will give you questions
[1:18:12] and doubts and fears and frustrations
[1:18:14] and all these different kind of things
[1:18:16] in every
[1:18:18] service but you have to turn him on his
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:23] heels you have to turn him on his heels
[1:18:26] when he comes to your Pew and begins to
[1:18:29] cause you to doubt
[1:18:32] you go ahead put your put your finger on
[1:18:35] your chest
[1:18:43] you now he says
[1:18:46] here he said then today they they have
[1:18:49] the nerve to
[1:18:50] say wonder whatever happened in the god
[1:18:53] of the Bible
[1:18:55] where is that God why you choked him out
[1:18:59] by your Creeds you choked him out by
[1:19:01] your Traditions you placed him way back
[1:19:03] there in history he is a god of
[1:19:08] history and what he waiting on today
[1:19:11] he's that same God of history and then
[1:19:14] when Moses called him out at the Red Sea
[1:19:17] the god of History Rose Way up and
[1:19:20] Joshua called the god of history at
[1:19:22] Jordan and he rose up up and made a way
[1:19:25] and when Daniel called on him in a fiery
[1:19:28] furnace he made a way and in the Lions
[1:19:30] then and the Hebrew children in a fiery
[1:19:33] furnace he made a
[1:19:35] way he's still the same God of History
[1:19:38] he's waiting for his
[1:19:40] people to call him out of History the
[1:19:44] same God remains
[1:19:48] God the same God remains
[1:19:52] God he's God forever
[1:19:58] can you say it he's my
[1:20:04] God now let me explain something to
[1:20:07] you this really hit me when I was a
[1:20:10] young
[1:20:14] Christian God is not a
[1:20:17] man to where that he loses
[1:20:21] power so God can save the worst
[1:20:27] sinner in the whole
[1:20:32] world he can save the worst sinner in
[1:20:36] the whole
[1:20:38] world it does not diminish his power
[1:20:46] any any now you and I have people that
[1:20:50] we don't think will'll ever be
[1:20:52] saved but what about a man that killed
[1:20:55] 37 murdered 37 different people you and
[1:21:00] I may have
[1:21:02] limitations but that man is a
[1:21:07] believer that man is a Believer we could
[1:21:10] go to a sister and all the Deery of the
[1:21:13] world but when God Saves
[1:21:18] them it's as though she never did it in
[1:21:20] the first place
[1:21:24] man's Grace is much different than God's
[1:21:29] grace sometimes we don't think well go
[1:21:31] there's a certain limit of of of
[1:21:34] sickness and and you know once it goes
[1:21:36] by a certain limit that you know this is
[1:21:38] now out of the hands of God are you
[1:21:42] serious are you serious Lazarus is a
[1:21:45] good
[1:21:46] [Applause]
[1:21:48] example worms are now crawling in his
[1:21:53] body whether you know it or not you can
[1:21:55] have the best casket you can have the
[1:21:57] best mortician you can have all that but
[1:22:00] about after 4
[1:22:02] days you're a wormy
[1:22:07] sack
[1:22:09] me yeah that's why you put perfume
[1:22:13] on that's why you have to
[1:22:16] bathe that's why you need to brush your
[1:22:18] teeth turn to your neighbor bathe brush
[1:22:21] your teeth it'll be easier to set beside
[1:22:23] of you if you you bathe and brush your
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:33] teeth but just give it four days after
[1:22:38] death and worms start eating your
[1:22:42] body
[1:22:45] worms that you have been feeding fet
[1:22:48] Manan
[1:22:52] flounder come on Crow
[1:22:58] ATS
[1:23:01] salad mine don't get a lot of
[1:23:04] salad the only thing I like green is
[1:23:15] jello honest to
[1:23:17] God Boy Scout honor
[1:23:24] without hope Lazarus was without
[1:23:29] hope but Jesus called him by
[1:23:36] name he called him by name and when he
[1:23:39] stepped out of the Grave he told him
[1:23:43] take off his grave clothes he's not
[1:23:45] going to need them no more then he told
[1:23:48] him said let's
[1:23:50] eat so a man that had worms crawling
[1:23:53] through him
[1:23:55] come now had a change your
[1:23:58] clothes and now was eating with
[1:24:03] Jesus well brother Ron I don't know if I
[1:24:06] can believe Hey listen just look across
[1:24:08] this audience there's some wormy people
[1:24:11] here only a few days or months or years
[1:24:14] ago they were dead in sin worms crawling
[1:24:18] all through them but God changed the
[1:24:21] grave clothes of their life changed
[1:24:23] their neighbor
[1:24:29] CH
[1:24:36] Hallelujah and now they're sitting at
[1:24:39] the same table with
[1:24:41] you they're eating they're they're
[1:24:44] fellowshipping they're enjoying it
[1:24:55] unbelief but does not do
[1:24:59] nothing but condemn the
[1:25:04] unbeliever I want you to remember a
[1:25:06] principal theme Satan may put a curse on
[1:25:09] your life but it's only effective if you
[1:25:12] believe
[1:25:14] [Applause]
[1:25:16] it he may try to put a curse on your
[1:25:19] life but it's only effective if you
[1:25:22] believe it
[1:25:27] you got depression and listen you can go
[1:25:29] to doctors and give you all kind of
[1:25:32] labels but it's only effective if you
[1:25:37] believe
[1:25:41] it we had a boss named
[1:25:44] Charlie Charlie was a good
[1:25:47] guy we all love
[1:25:50] Charlie and Charlie was a guy that you
[1:25:54] know know was always nervous about
[1:25:56] everything and so I told the boys we
[1:25:59] needed Charlie to be away cuz we wanted
[1:26:01] to have a
[1:26:04] picnic we were making bombs and today we
[1:26:07] decided to have a picnic and we didn't
[1:26:09] need Charlie
[1:26:12] there Charlie Charlie might get too
[1:26:14] nervous at our
[1:26:17] picnic and uh I told the boys I said
[1:26:20] every time Charlie walks by you tell him
[1:26:22] how bad he looks
[1:26:29] and so he walked by me and I said
[1:26:30] Charlie you feeling okay buddy well he
[1:26:33] after he done walked about past 10
[1:26:35] people he said you know what I came in
[1:26:37] this morning I was feeling really good
[1:26:38] but you know how I really ain't feeling
[1:26:42] that
[1:26:45] good about 15 minutes after I talked to
[1:26:48] him he was gone he checked out he went
[1:26:50] home he was gone to three days we had a
[1:26:53] wonderful picture
[1:26:57] picnic we got our work
[1:27:00] done but we had a wonderful
[1:27:05] picnic why don't you tell the devil when
[1:27:07] he comes picking on you Satan you don't
[1:27:10] look so
[1:27:13] good are you feeling all right you don't
[1:27:16] look so
[1:27:21] good your bite is not as bad as it used
[1:27:24] to be and your howling is getting all
[1:27:27] soft and
[1:27:30] wimpy you used to be a really bad devil
[1:27:33] but you're kind of a wimp
[1:27:35] anymore he wants to talk to you you talk
[1:27:38] back to
[1:27:38] [Applause]
[1:27:51] him now God is true to his promises he
[1:27:55] says no matter what he has to do now
[1:27:58] think about this no matter what he has
[1:28:01] to do he will bankrupt
[1:28:06] Heavens before he will let his word go
[1:28:13] defeated I want you to think about that
[1:28:16] God will bankrupt
[1:28:18] heaven right before he lets this message
[1:28:23] not have a rapture
[1:28:32] I'm going to I'm not going to shout
[1:28:33] right here but I sure feel like
[1:28:36] it now God asked us to believe for the
[1:28:40] impossible because he's able to do that
[1:28:42] which is
[1:28:43] impossible Abraham staggered not at the
[1:28:46] promise of God through unbelief but with
[1:28:48] strong giving praise unto God God wants
[1:28:51] you to do the miraculous
[1:28:54] right he's not just talking to preachers
[1:29:01] here your child gets a fever it's a got
[1:29:04] a tooth AE it's got an
[1:29:07] earache you Faithful moms and
[1:29:10] dads lay your hands on that baby doll
[1:29:14] and
[1:29:19] believe God wants you to do the
[1:29:21] miraculous he wants you to believe the
[1:29:23] mirac ulace and by accepting it by faith
[1:29:26] you prove what you believe he
[1:29:29] is you see it God wants you to take his
[1:29:33] word for it he speaks it and if God has
[1:29:37] said it all heavens and earth will pass
[1:29:39] away but his word can't
[1:29:45] pass brother Ron I don't know if I can
[1:29:48] you don't have
[1:29:50] to he's already conquered for you Lord

[1:31:50] tube and get it in just in seconds and
[1:31:52] in time which is incredibly
[1:31:55] important and so he called his mother

[1:53:42] amazing did anybody not have any
[1:53:46] trouble no brother Mike didn't have no
[1:53:50] trouble but he was putting on his

[1:53:55] I say it again did anybody have trouble
[1:53:57] this
[1:54:02] week and you still showed
[1:54:06] up you still showed up I'd give you an
[1:54:10] exercise to get up and look at the seat
[1:54:12] that you're sitting on but you're
[1:54:14] feeling the seat that Satan tried your
[1:54:16] best to not let you set in this
[1:54:21] week he did all that to
[1:54:28] you and you still showed
[1:54:31] [Applause]
[1:54:37] up now a contest if we could go unbelief
[1:54:41] belief a contest is a test of
[1:54:46] strength now in the olden days I wasn't
[1:54:51] there
[1:54:53] I'm not that
[1:54:55] old but in the olden days there was an
[1:54:57] Indian tradition of who was the
[1:55:00] strongest and they would build a fire
[1:55:03] have a rope and they would pull their
[1:55:07] opponent Into the
[1:55:11] Fire and that would say who is the
[1:55:16] strongest now it wasn't for husband and
[1:55:20] wife amen
[1:55:28] it was not isn't that good
[1:55:31] news so what I'm here
[1:55:34] today is trying to drop something into
[1:55:36] your heart take a hold to the
[1:55:40] Rope pull the devil Into the Fire
[1:55:55] now let me let me just give you a couple
[1:55:57] more things before we let you go Satan
[1:55:59] has tried every scheme that he
[1:56:01] can to
[1:56:03] discredit this Satan's tried everything
[1:56:07] that he could to discredit
[1:56:10] him discredit you he's tried to get him
[1:56:15] to take the kingdom without suffering he
[1:56:17] tried to get him to take it without
[1:56:19] Redemption
[1:56:22] when he was up on the Mount of
[1:56:24] Temptation he tried to give him the
[1:56:29] kingdom but God knew that it was going
[1:56:31] to take Calvary to redeem
[1:56:36] you are you with me now now I want you
[1:56:40] to remember who you are and I have quote
[1:56:42] the
[1:56:43] scripture way too
[1:56:45] much ye are of
[1:56:48] God little children and have overcame
[1:56:51] them because greater is he that is in
[1:56:55] you go ahead and finish
[1:57:00] it Greater is he that is in
[1:57:13] you in the face of all
[1:57:16] doubt God goes right on and proves his
[1:57:20] word un Bel does not stop
[1:57:24] God it doesn't hinder him I don't care
[1:57:28] how much the world unbeliev it it's
[1:57:31] still going to happen unbelief doesn't
[1:57:34] do nothing but condemns the
[1:57:42] unbeliever so you've got neighbors
[1:57:44] you've got
[1:57:45] family and when you tell them that you
[1:57:47] drive four hours to church and you tell
[1:57:50] them it's worth it
[1:57:55] amen how many wants to get in the same
[1:57:57] van with
[1:57:59] you they laugh they make fun they say
[1:58:02] all the different kind of things but you
[1:58:05] believe are you with me all of you you
[1:58:09] believe and Believers
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:13] believe unbelief does not stop God it
[1:58:16] only stops the
[1:58:20] unbeliever are you with me oh I love it
[1:58:22] don't you and God is true to his
[1:58:29] promise God doesn't make a promise he
[1:58:32] can't
[1:58:33] keep God is not a
[1:58:37] politician he's not after your
[1:58:42] vote he's your
[1:58:45] god brother Ron but I I I sometimes I
[1:58:48] just I just need more strength well let
[1:58:51] me give you a couple more quotes Satan
[1:58:53] in the name of Jesus Christ I come in
[1:58:56] this Duel of Faith challenging you not
[1:59:00] in my my own power or name you know that
[1:59:03] I could not do that but I come as a
[1:59:06] representative of Jesus Christ claiming
[1:59:09] the Divine gift that was ministered to
[1:59:11] me by an Angel telling me to get the
[1:59:13] people to believe that the sickness
[1:59:15] would not stand before them with all
[1:59:17] sincere prayer was made and I pray
[1:59:20] sincerely to God therefore you cannot
[1:59:24] hold this woman any
[1:59:27] longer I charge thee by the Son of God
[1:59:31] Jesus Christ come out of this
[1:59:36] woman and it
[1:59:38] left I like
[1:59:40] results Satan an angel of God came 14
[1:59:44] years ago to Greens Mill one night and
[1:59:46] told me as a local Minister that I was
[1:59:48] sent to pray for the sick and this is
[1:59:51] what was told
[1:59:52] and you're aware and you're exposed you
[1:59:56] can't you can have unbelief in the
[1:59:59] people you can make people doubt but you
[2:00:02] can't make Christ do
[2:00:05] anything because he has stripped you of
[2:00:08] every legal right that you ever had when
[2:00:11] he died at Calvary he paid the debt of
[2:00:14] all sin and
[2:00:16] unbelief and God has given his servants
[2:00:19] power to cast you
[2:00:23] out and I use his name I come in the
[2:00:27] name of Jesus Christ I challenge you to
[2:00:29] a d of Faith leave this girl come out of
[2:00:34] her in the name of Jesus
[2:00:40] Christ now he says now I'm going to pray
[2:00:43] for you the Bible said the prayer of
[2:00:45] faith shall save the sick and God shall
[2:00:49] raise them up and if I have found Grace
[2:00:52] in The Blessed God may this be the night
[2:00:56] that you'll they'll never forget May the
[2:00:58] Holy Spirit Come into every heart just
[2:01:02] now and just move out all everything and
[2:01:05] all the sickness from their body I
[2:01:09] challenge the devil to a
[2:01:12] debate now watch what he does Satan you
[2:01:15] are aware that you're
[2:01:17] whipped ain't that great ain't that
[2:01:20] great that makes you just want to shout
[2:01:21] right there
[2:01:22] Satan you're aware that you're whipped
[2:01:25] you have no legal rights Jesus Christ my
[2:01:28] Lord stripped you of every Authority
[2:01:30] that you had and when he died at Calvary
[2:01:32] to take away sin and sickness you're
[2:01:35] nothing but a bluff and we're calling
[2:01:37] your bluff and you know that when the
[2:01:39] Lord came to to the tree and he cursed
[2:01:42] the tree the next day it was withered
[2:01:44] and the Lord said to his disciples have
[2:01:46] faith in
[2:01:48] God for if you say shall say if if ye
[2:01:52] shall say to this mountain be moved and
[2:01:54] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[2:01:56] what you have said is coming to pass you
[2:01:58] can have what you have
[2:02:01] said Satan you know the scripture on
[2:02:04] that and I have just taught this people
[2:02:06] that that it's God in them and if God is
[2:02:10] in them they can speak to that disease
[2:02:13] and say be away from
[2:02:18] me and don't doubt in their heart and
[2:02:22] right then that disease has to move for
[2:02:25] Christ said so for it's not them that
[2:02:28] speaks it's the father that dwells in
[2:02:31] them that's speaking they're in need so
[2:02:35] come out of them in the name of Jesus
[2:02:38] Christ I say as a servant of God by the
[2:02:41] message from the angel who is Anointed
[2:02:43] and has proved to the people that Jesus
[2:02:45] is here and the message is right come
[2:02:49] out of them in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:02:51] I jur you to leave every sick Merc and
[2:02:56] get into outer darkness in the name of
[2:03:00] Jesus
[2:03:02] Christ and about that time a wind blows
[2:03:05] through the
[2:03:10] building are you with me can you give me
[2:03:12] just a couple more
[2:03:13] minutes and Jesus said unto him no man
[2:03:16] Haven have put his hand to the plow and
[2:03:18] looking back is fit for the kingdom of
[2:03:21] God
[2:03:22] right and in 28 and 18 Matthew and Jesus
[2:03:26] came and spake unto them and saying all
[2:03:29] power is given in heaven and in Earth in
[2:03:34] John chap 15 and verse 7 if you abide in
[2:03:37] me and my words abide in you you shall
[2:03:39] ask what you will and it shall be done
[2:03:42] unto
[2:03:45] you I love this next quote I'm so glad
[2:03:48] that a man can so completely serve God
[2:03:52] tell the devil don't know what to do
[2:03:54] with
[2:03:57] him can that be
[2:04:03] you are you with
[2:04:05] me now this weekend you have been
[2:04:08] challenged to believe in the

[2:04:12] ought to believe it like never
[2:04:15] before you have been challenged to
[2:04:17] believe but yet the devil will fight you

[2:29:38] love of the
