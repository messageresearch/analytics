glad you're here each and every one of you were we're so glad to be here on a cold night and and we're just glad that god has been with us over the last bit and protected us and i was asked to to send a greeting and and so i will do that and actually been asked a couple different places but i would do that just now and and ask my brother ed hammer meister they're getting ready to have a watch night service and they wanted me to be a part of that and so and so here we are and we'd like to greet them in the name of the lord jesus christ from our group here and uh brother edward we're we're half and half we have half on saturday night and half on sunday and and we just are we're just doing what we can during the conditions of this layout to see a coveted conditions and but god's still god and he's still a healer and he's still a waymaker as we begin to approach a new year dear god help it to be better than 2020. and uh we believe that we're looking just at the rapture just any moment and we realize that the world is shaping up in its conditions the militaries are shaping up they're doing their their exercises and but the bar is a bride that's coming ready for the coming of the lord we have not lost our anticipations our revival is just as strong as it's ever been in our lives i'm looking more forward to it and never look forward to it i'd like to thank you for your prayers for me over the last year it was on december the 22nd that god spoke to me if you will trust me i will use you like never before six months before that i begin to feel a kind of a waning of my strength and then i'm then right in the christmas season i learned that i had i i would go to brother biscuits and even being at brother biscuits is where i learned that i had cancer in my lung and and then then within the coming months i would be with the doctors actually brother tim pruitt would go with me to the doctors and there i would learn that i had stage four cancer and i we was in for a very dark and difficult journey no way could i understand how difficult that people that suffer with cancer how difficult that can be you know sometimes in a diagnosis they say you might have cancer there's a quantum leap between you might have cancer and having cancer and then it's an incredible another leap to deal with it when it's stage four cancer and they say there'll be no end and this is a this is this is going to be how how you die in your life but from the very beginning we believe that god's our healer whether it was in our brain with three tumors and or within our lungs it was full of tumors or spread through our body cancer's just cancer and if we remember there was a conversation that our prophet had with the angel of the lord and it wasn't the angel the lord that brought up cancer it was brother branham that brought up cancer because this is the age of cancer it's a it's cancer something that takes over the good cells of your body and begins to destroy the life that was in you now satan sent his best from the quarters of hell because he knew what kind of a fighter that we was and we remember that brother branham said that that the devil can't touch a hair of your head until he first gets permission from god now he may shake you in a moment for you to be shaken but when you're really a child of god when you come to grips with it and when you come to grips that god's on my side and there's nothing that the devil can do until he's first got permission brother tim pruitt and brother donny reagan came and prayed for me in my home because with cancer this may be a help to somebody but with cancer there's a tormenting spirit that comes with it i'd like to report that that night god brought me a peace that has never left when brother wayne lawson was here i lost my vision to my left side and to where i can't see anything in the peripheral in both eyes because the tumor laid on the on the on the optical nerves that go around the back of your brain that tumor was about that that size and it was bleeding and as it wrapped around my optical nerves it caused me to go blind and that's what alerted it shows the devil is stupid if he would have left me not going blind that thing would have busted within just a few days and i've lost my life but he's crazy devil he calls me to go blind and while brother wayne lawson was here preaching it alerted to me that something was going on and i went to uva and through rigorous tests of of the entire entire day and week they found that that i had a tumor that was bleeding god sent us an anointed doctor to take care of that and was able to pull that tumor out of my brain couldn't operate on the other two because they're inoperable but but it took that tumor out of my brain and never gained the sight of seeing back to my left side but i've got an incredible chauffeur and she drives me everywhere that i need to go and the boys drive me and so i understand that important people have chauffeurs and you say well brother ron do you pray that your vision come back you know sometimes i i get disappointed that my vision is is is not there but i feel like a man that met the angel of the lord and the angel of the lord smote him in his thigh and he had a limp the rest of his life that is a reminder that god saved my life maybe others are going through incredible tests maybe it's not cancer brother ed in your congregation you've been an awesome audience brother harold and it's been my buddy for for decades now we've stood and preached camp meetings all over the place and and your church is like home to me brother sam fixes me the saskatoon pie i missed that this year but maybe in the coming years we can make that happen again but i believe that we're getting ready to step to another realm i was just at the doctor and i'll close with these things let me just say one more thing it was in about july the 4th that i was preaching here in this audience and i preached a sermon on i must get to jesus and let me just say this to you we all must get to jesus and in that sermon i i begin to speak of how people would travel 17 hours just to be in a brother branham service something hit me in the night as i went home and i was laying in bed something hit me there was some there were some things that brother tim was going to come to my place and or was i going to go to his place and it hit me that that was a 17-hour trip the doctors had told me not to travel but my boys decided they would get me to brother tim's i hadn't worked up to that time with the boys and and i was just i was my energy was waning my strength was leaving me and i thought i was coming to my end i honestly did that was my private thoughts i felt like that i was just i just i told sister connie i'm at a point to where i i don't know if i can keep keep going i think i'm gonna quit my treatments because it's just i just don't have energy and uh connie would pray and say lord he's he's got to have strength to keep his treatments going in the middle of the night god woke me up to travel to brother tim fruits and it was there that brother adam frazier received the holy ghost along with two other young men and i got a touch i didn't i didn't see a lightning bolt i didn't hear thunder but we prayed we made the trip back home and i was sick during some of that journey but i went to work from that point and i haven't missed a day since that with the boys i've been did my best i've missed some sundays but i've did my best to preach every sunday morning here in this audience because in the mornings i'm more alert in the night i get a little bit weary probably like some of you others that's got gray hair but god restored my strength in the midst of a death sentence in the midst of a death sentence god has had miracle after miracle after miracle i hope this doesn't take too long but i just went to the eye appointment the other day and the cancer that was in the eye it's gone the two cataracts that was on my eyes they're gone we thank god for that sister connie and i was at the doctor's appointment on monday and dr gone just looked at me and she said you are a miracle she said we consider you here at this cancer center our miracle amen i thank god for all the doctors and the nurses that have taken care of me i appreciate them with all my heart but the high physician gets all the credit brotherhood i'm more determined than ever before i'm more driven than ever before and faith in action i believe that i'll speak stronger than ever before with more clarity and more strength and by god's help i'm committed as i step into a new year whatever it holds for me whether it holds the rapture or i live to see next christmas i'm committed so no matter what excuse a person might have sitting in your audience or in this audience of why they can't serve the lord i want to encourage you you might be fighting some very difficult things but i want to encourage you to serve the lord like never before i take treatments twice a day 20 pills a day they're difficult they're hard but let me just say this to you life's worth living so whatever you're fighting and struggling with this message and serving jesus christ and having a family around you is worth living for no matter what you've got to go through fight to live fight to live fight to live that's what i'm determined to do is fight to live god bless you amen and he is determined he can still work with us boys like nothing's ever wrong with him sometimes we'll just look at him say dad just go and relax it's gonna be okay saved by grace i've been saved by grace it's not what i deserve but i'm saved by grace amen by grace well i've been saved by grace my name is in the book of life and my scenes are washed away [Music] saved by grace well i've been saved by grace oh it's not what i deserve but i'm saved by grace i was alone in the darkness i could not find my way but jesus shined his light on me and turned on my night to dance i was alone in the darkness i could not find my way but jesus shined his light on me and turned [Music] my name is in the book of life all my sins are washed away will save my grace all i've been saved by grace [Music] oh how he brought me from the other side [Music] oh when i reach that city will those gates swing open wide i'm gonna sing redemption story oh how he brought me from the other side will save my grace all the life being saved by grace my name is in [Music] i'm saved by his grace oh i've been saved by grace but i'm saved by grace hallelujah and it's amazing grace hallelujah amazing grace god bless you this evening we welcome you here and we hope you all had a wonderful and merry christmas with your families and uh what a special season that we're in and uh i told dad we could just dismiss after that that's a report that'll shake every devil in hell i'm still here when every odd was stacked up against ron spencer he's still here it's because there is a power on the inside of a bride that knows how to get in touch with her bridegroom and we say thank you lord we're very grateful you know i didn't have to get no gift this year didn't have to have anything just to have what we're standing we're standing behind this pulpit just a few seconds ago is worth more to me than life and i think about all the sermons that we've heard this past year and think about the eternal things that's happened those things can't be measured but we say thank the lord for him amen amen amen let's let's just go to the word this evening over to the book of philippians chapter 3 and verse 7. um amen philippians chapter 3 and verse 7 but what things were gained to me those i counted lost for christ yay doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellent sea of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i might win christ and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by if by any means that i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which i am also also i am apprehended of christ jesus brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus let's just speak to the author of the book just now father we come before you lord very humbled and very grateful father for the opportunity that we have the that we have here this evening to be able to enter into your courts with praise and thanksgiving to flow forth from our life and to offer our life a living sacrifice unto you lord we're very grateful for where you have brought us from and what you have done for us lord god one more time we ask that you had spread forth your word of life before us that we might that we might press towards the mark oh god that we might apprehend those things which are before so god lord you know all things lord jesus you know everything that we've gone through this week you've seen the you've seen the accounts of this week the events of this week father how we were blessed father to be able to to say that we went through christmas one more time and lord jesus we're asking god that that you would just come and visit us with your presence here tonight lord we've already felt your presence and we've already sung the songs of zion we've already heard a testimony that'll shake goliath father and lord i pray tonight that you would just come lord with a word of encouragement and strength tonight and we'll be careful to serve you and give you praise in the name of jesus christ amen amen you can have your seats at this time we'd like to speak to you just for a moment on this thought of moving forward and we we know that we're just coming through the christmas season here and still in the in the in the prelude and in the season of christmas and the beginning of new year and and we know that that every every every year we always give a theme give a theme of what we are looking forward to into the next year of 2021 well i i this would be the last service that i would speak to you in 2020 lord willing unless unless i would have to speak in the morning which i'm really hoping not to and but as we we always give though give our theme of what we're looking into and what we're what we're going to but i'm really hoping that we don't even have to go into 2021 that we just go into a rapture but just moving forward as we as we have been taught by the prophet to always to occupy till he comes and and to move forward into things we i wanted to move forward in this theme of of moving forward and here we are we we preached to you this all past year 2020 that god is with us and we will see miracles and we're not necessarily moving on from a fault or moving on from theme to theme but carrying on a thing that we're moving forward right into the book of acts right on with a continuation of a book of acts that that we will see miracles we will see giants fall we'll do the impossible and we're moving forward in the things that god has for us and looking in this christmas season and we we see and the things that are very relevant to our mind and that that christ that we look the very first view that we get of christ coming is is a babe in a manger and we we see him there in a manger and we see all the events that transpire the next event we see is him eight days old as he's being presented at the temple and and simeon that is that has been visited that that he is told that he will not see death until he sees the christ child then we see him as he's as christ is two years old and he's and he's standing there and there's men that have traveled from afar that they've brought they've been astrologers and and there's been a light that's been leading them for the past two years as as there's been a star that would rise out of jesse and and these men are bringing gifts that that mean something very significant to christ's coming of of gold and frankincense and myrrh and all of them representing his life and then we catch his next view between two years old we catch him at 12 years old we see him as he's standing there in a temple when his mother and his father's foster mother and father they take him to the temple at the at the feast of passover and they take him there and they move on without jesus and they they finally go into a spot and they realize that they've moved on without jesus and we find that that is where the pentecostal people are today they've moved on without jesus and they don't know where they left him at but they left him in 1956 when they rejected this message when they when pentecost himself they they rejected him but jesus when we see him when we see him as as mary and and joseph come running and they're seeking out their kin folk where is he at and they find him in the temple as he's standing there and he has as he has the men and the astrologers and the theologians of the day he has them astounded and he's teaching them about creation he's teaching them about life because here is the one they don't recognize it they don't see it but here he is a 12 year old boy and he's standing there and he's astounding the men of the eight the smartest men of the age but jesus did not stay as a baby in a manger he moved on he moved on from being a child that that met the wise men he moved on from being a 12 year old boy that would stand there and wreck and tell his mother that would tell his foster mother you knew that i would be about my father's business you knew that i would be here you didn't have to go searching for me everywhere else jesus rebuked her jesus rebuked her you know who i am you know what the angel said to you this is what i am sent to do but then there's a gap between 12 and 30 years old that we don't see anything that jesus is doing and there's theologians of the day that would say that those are the lost years of christ we don't know where he was maybe he was over in ethiopia and he was studying out things but i want to say to you those things were not in vain you may have not seen jesus in those time you may not have seen him in history you may not have seen him in the bible between 12 and 30 but there were things that were transpiring in jesus's life that led him to this spot but then he didn't just stay there he moved on into his ministry and let me say this to you there may be a short gap in somebody's life that you ain't seen them you ain't seen them for some time or you haven't seen them in church or you haven't seen you don't know what they're going through you don't know where they are but don't you write jesus off when jesus comes to his fulfillment he'll be exactly what he was but built to be but he's moving on and we watch as jesus goes as immediately we catch the view of jesus at 30 years old as he's coming down to the water as he's there's a man that's down there that they call him they call him the holy dunker down there as he's dunking people in the water and here jesus is making his way and john the baptist says this is the lamb of god that will take away the sins of the world jesus's ministry was moving from transition to transition and now he comes into fullness notice in jesus's first year of ministry there is such an attraction to his ministry because you see his first pool was bringing in the blind and the heart and all of those and there was a great attraction and miracles and signs and wonders were being done and then in a second in his second year of ministry there was a law there was kind of a there was kind of a decline as a prophet would say it's a law in his ministry and then in his third year they crucified him but jesus did not stay as a baby in a manger if you keep jesus in a manger you can't get jesus to the cross but he's not just wanting you to stay in your condition and your experience of you receiving the holy ghost 13 years ago he's wanting you to have a fresh experience a fresh revival 2020 was a great year we sing great miracles but this year coming we're going to see more than we ever seen before i believe that we're going to have more prodigals return than we've ever seen in our life i believe we're going to have more saved than we've ever seen in our life i believe it's the year it's the year of jubilee when we see when we see limbs come back on people when we see cancer driven out when we see doctors astonished like never before we're not just staying where we're at we're moving forward you see if you fail to move forward you are always going to live life and regret i've been a part being in the business world i've been a part of some very very high and intellectual meetings of multi-millionaires here and across the u.s of a setting great setting great meetings of people that that could buy every one of us with it with with all the money and just think it's chump change and i've stood there in great meetings with them and you can hear them say now now if i'd only done this if i only done this and they are sitting there telling you on a word of if if i'd have only done this if i only done this i'd have been here a little bit faster or if i'd only if i'd only made this business move i i could have got to the next step or if i'd only done this you know i've been a part of of some people's lives where they tell me you know if i'd only surrender to god just a little bit sooner if i'd only give in and gave him my heart just a little bit sooner you see if you fail to move forward you are always living life in a cycle of regrets haunted by decisions or what if what if i'd have surrendered what if i'd have came to the altar what if i were to really pray through that night what if i wouldn't have done that what if i wouldn't have done this tonight's tonight to stop with the what ifs and come to a commitment like never before and you dedicate that it's not what if anymore you can say that i met him face to face i'm moving on from this spot you see where israel always got in trouble is when they got comfortable where they are but the pillar of fire was always taking them forward are you with me now the prophet would say is that some time ago he said i read a story of of days of our nob he so one of the greatest presidents i think the nation ever had was was lincoln not because that he he come from kentucky but because he was a great man he was deprived of an education but yet was was something in his heart some purpose he said i like man of this and i like people that's got something they're fighting for not just lay around well whatever what comes along will be all right oh be up and at it and lincoln never let his education stand in the way he had something to do and i think every christian ought to be that way find your purpose and go do it find your purpose and go do it that's the way every christian life ought to be find what the will of god is step in it don't argue about it don't reason about it just step in men that ever amounted anything to anything in life was men that put their full trust in god when you look at the men of this nation when you got george washington when he's a leader of a leader of an army when his men ain't got shoes on their feet they they barely got enough weapons to get the job done they barely got enough clothes on them to get through the winter but there was a man that was perseverant that would that would pray all night through the snow through the wind he'd pray all night because he knew he knew that the delaware river was in front of him there were men like paul revere that would that would go out when they heard the message that the british was coming he wrote out with a message he wrote out with a message and told the whole city he told the poor he told the rich he told the farmer he told the businessman he told everybody and he saved this great nation because he took a message and he ran with a message he ran with a message and he saved this great nation oh hallelujah men like stonewall jackson that would stand there and the bullet fray was going around him the warframe was going around him and men would ask him how can you stand in the face of opposition like that he said there's not one time that a drink of water ever hits my lips unless i first thank god for that he was a man that knew how to pray and he could stand there in the face of opposition and he knew that there was not going to be one bullet that could take him off the scene unless god was willing to take him off the scene he was willing to stand there a man of courage a man of a man of fortitude that could stand there in the face of the opposition and not move backwards hallelujah i read this statement today and brother branham said in go tell he said if this heritage of god if this people that god died for if this church that's called by his name is ever to be saved if we've if we've got a messenger with a message from the throne we've got to have a messenger with a message from the from the throne to meet the challenge of this day i want to say to the church of the living god this message that you're packing is the message that will meet the challenge of goliath's post in this day i would like to say in record echo it from the natural realm william branham you did a great job heavens knew how great a job he did but from my standpoint i would like to say william bralam you ran well your message is the message that will finish off and cap off the bride's ministry hallelujah william branham couldn't let he couldn't let his ignorantly stand in the way but he didn't he couldn't let a seventh grade education stand in his way but he didn't he could let people that caught in the kentucky squad stand in his way but he didn't william branham was a prince amongst men stood with the great stood with the presidents stood with men that were statures above him in education but they could not hold a candle to the ministry that he was packing but he didn't just let an education stop him he took a message though he didn't have an education though he didn't have great money but this was a kentucky man that could take a message around the world and could relate to every person he didn't let his trouble stand in front of him he didn't let his little girl passing away stand in front of him very much on the contrary you see satan thinks that he's punched at you and he thinks he's put an end to your ministry can i call your life a ministry he thinks he's got a punch on you and he's into your ministry your life he thinks he's got to stop on you but what he don't realize that what he's doing in your life what he's what he's tempting you by what he's what he's putting you through is only to bring glory to the god of heaven satan thought that he would make william branham curse god because he saw his little girl being ripped away from his life make her cross out make her get to such a spot in her life that she couldn't recognize in my eyes turning flies landing on her but what he didn't realize is that william branham would look on every cross-eyed case and every single time that this prophet of god would see across our child it would not be one time that they didn't walk away completely whole when satan thinks he's got a punch on your life it's only for the destruction of his kingdom he's only working things out for his own destruction hallelujah hallelujah there's a lot of people that are filled with education but never do anything with it i know a lot of people that are sitting sitting with degrees all around america filled with ideas but they lack the courage and the fortitude to execute there's a lot of people that could tell you how to live right but they can't live like themselves there's a lot of people that could tell me how to preach but they ain't never met the same god that i met there's a lot of men that could tell you what to do and what not to do but they ain't got the courage to stand toe to toe with the devil face to face there's a lot of people that's got ideas just because they made just because they make it they got brains or they got a degree don't make them smart hallelujah there's a lot of people that's got the idea what to do with this message and they can't run with it but god knows exactly who will run with this message he knows who he can trust with it and he knows who will get the message out if paul revere could stand there and say the british is coming let andrew spencer let the bride of jesus christ say jesus is coming abraham had every excuse in front of him but he didn't let it stop him from moving forward abraham had 25 years of failures in front of him but he kept pushing towards that promise israel had a promised land that was promised to her but she had to fight for it you've got a rapture in front of you but you got to live through laodicea overcome through laodicea to make it if you say well you know what i'm just going to put the jets on and i'm just going to relax through laodicea you will not be an overcomer you might overcome in your house and you might build yourself a bunker 50 feet deep you say i'm living the life no devil can get me down here living like a hermit don't make you an overcomer and going out and laying at a bar joint don't make you an overcomer an overcomer means that you can stand through the temptations of life and when satan comes against you just because he tempts you does not mean that you sinned he can tempt you all you want but when you give into it then it's saying hallelujah but the overcomer is the one when satan says you're gonna take another drink of this and he said not today satan you're gonna fall you're gonna listen to this denominational message and it'll take you out there and you'll say not today satan i'll stick with jesus an overcomer is somebody that's willing to press the battle somebody that's willing to give their all somebody that's willing to fight everybody with love everybody would love to be like that quote brother brandon would talk about he said now god don't make you an overcomer by pushing putting you in a pipe and pushing you through it he said that don't make you an overcomer you gotta fight for it blind bartimaeus had to fight past the crowd when everybody told him to be quiet he's done pasture how many times i wonder how many blind bartimaeus be sitting here or be listening around the world they've been told you just be quiet this is a time where you don't speak this is a time when when jesus is done past you but there's some blind bartimaeuses that are sitting here that would say that son of david have mercy on me i'd say if these walls could talk your life could speak it would testify that there's blind bartimaeuses setting all around the world that persevered and pressed past what the people said notice you can never go forward until you're perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of a doubt that you're walking in god's will and then when you know that you're in god's will and walking in his way nothing can stop you because you know where you're standing you know the way you're going you know what you got in your mind and you know what the will of god is then you can do it then you can do it life is what you make it are you with me that life is what you make it your issues are what they what you make it your problems are what you make it this gospel is what you make it god is what you make him you can either let your mountains be bigger than your god or you can let god be bigger than your mountains because he really is bigger than your mountains life is what you make it you can either stay in the condition you're in or you can choose to move forward i remember when i was i was in high school football and i'd never played football before i didn't get all the size that matthew got he took all the steak and the taters and left me with ice cream i remember i remember i had a coach coach bill hale had a great influence on my life and i don't speak people the same way without him coming up in my life the way i speak to people because he had a great influence in my life and maybe don't even know how great the influence he had but i remember one time i was uh i was training in run running back position i didn't have no size it really wasn't that fast but i just had enough redhead there being enough fire on the inside of me that they would put me in every once in a while i was always happy to score against spotswood anyway and uh but i it seems like they trained me for that that one time i remember we were running this we were running this uh this course we were trying we were trying to get this drill down and they kept they che they just coached coach hale kept putting me through this thing and kept putting me through it and you know sometimes maybe your y'all's body's a little bit different than mine but my body wouldn't follow what my brain was telling it to do and i just kept going through the motions and trying to do the thing and i kept failing at what i was doing and coach hale come to me said he grabbed me by the helmet he said you're going to get this one way or another and every time i'd fail he'd make me get down give him five push-ups we'd run through it again i'd fail and he'd make me do do five push-ups he grabbed me by the helmet said spencer you're gonna get this thing one way or another and if you don't get it you're gonna be able to push up the house before soon well i finally got it i finally figured out what i was doing and what i need to do and he come over he said you know i still like you don't you you see i couldn't move forward in the condition of making mistakes all the time i could never bring forth the goal that he was setting before me because i kept shutting it down in my brain and my body wouldn't follow it now god's got a great big plan in front of us and sometimes the body wants to shut down and don't want to come to the goal that he's got before us covet has tried to shut down the body from getting to the goal fear has tried to stop the body from getting to faith but god is going to get that body exactly where he wants it so that it'll line up hallelujah what kovitt don't realize is that it's making the bride of jesus christ stronger kovitz just the name of a demon so cancer don't even know what it's doing it's just making the bride of jesus stronger sickness don't want to know what it's doing [Applause] notice the day that we're living in the hour of the time the church ought to be going forward instead it's going backwards that's right you can't you're if you're not going forward you're going backwards and god don't want his church to go backwards or set steel he wants us to go forward and don't slack at all the holy spirit don't say slack up here and wait a few years he said go forward constantly all the time and move on life's wife got in trouble once you look back jesus said that no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god any man that starts a job and don't finish it ain't got very much account in my book a man that says he's going to live for god and then goes out and serves the devil all week and wants to come back and serve god on the weekend ain't very much man in my book a man there a family that calls him a ceo christian christian a ceo christian a christmas and easter only christian that ain't a very much christian in my book a man that only wants to serve god when he's sick ain't very much man in my book a man that's only serving god because he puts his ties in and god pours back and he don't want the baptism of the holy ghost he ain't very much man in my book you'll find out tonight whether you're in my book or not but a man that says whether god gives or god takes away i'm still going to serve him that's a man when a woman says hey i ain't got very much money in the bank but i'm still going to pray to god even when i don't see him when they don't give me anything when he does give me something i'm still going to serve him that's a real woman in my book they don't let failure stop them from moving forward in the faith a prophet would preach a sermon in 1964 on going beyond the camp and he would grab it from hebrews 13 and 10 when when jesus when jesus suffered without the gate and suffer without the camp and he brings in that that moses that moses could never he could never go forward until we got out of the camp of egypt that moses had to get out of the camp that he'd been living in to do these things because he he'd been down there with a whole army and couldn't do it with all the armies of egypt he couldn't do it but one day god invited him into his camp you see that's where it makes all the difference in our life is when god invites us over you've heard the invitation come on over come on over to this side and israel had to make a move they moved them out in the wilderness and they they left their natural camp they left the mud camp they they left the camp made with straw and brick to dwell in tents out in the wilderness where there was no grain or nothing else and sometimes god asked us to do foolish things to our own thinking and if you ever leave the camp of your own reasoning that's the place that you'll find god you can only go beyond the camp you see a lot of people they they get in their mind of well this has got to happen or this has got to transpire for this to happen and they're so caught up in the reasonings of that god's got to jump through this hooper i've got to go through this and you got to get past your own you got to go beyond the camp jesus jesus went beyond the camp he went beyond what the sadducees and the pharisees were saying of him and you got to go beyond what the church world says of you you got to go home beyond what the world says of you and you got to even go on beyond what even church members say of you you got to have a fresh fire you can't get warm by moses as far you can't get warm by paul's fire but you got to go on to where the living god is in the camp he would preach a sermon called broken sister speak about those stagnated waters speak about those wiggle tails in those waters i'm afraid that sometimes that we allow our experience to slow down we allow things to just come in and we take in the gutters of life we take in the waters of life coming off off the gutters and they let anything into our experience we let sin in our experience we we let unbelief into our experience but the prophet would tell us about a little stream that was that was always bubbling whether he drank from it or whether deer drank from it it was always bubbling and it was something that that was pushing him that would always make him bubble and you he told us in that sermon that an artist and well never freezes up that sister and experience it'll freeze up on you everybody here that's living in virginia if you got pets you got to go out and kick the bucket to get the water to break right now but if there's some heat in that water you won't have to break that water if you just get a little fire if you just get a little fire behind that water it'll make it bubble if you ever get this old pentecostal experience that the people want to talk about today that those days are going by it's not about pentecost two thousand years ago it's about pentecost right now you can either stay in egypt or you can go into a wilderness where things are hard to believe or things you don't understand when you get out there that's where miracles are produced you can stay out in a world where they can explain everything or you can come here where miracles are not just every once in a while but an everyday occurrence they got a man sitting here you got a man sitting here that's an absolute miracle to be living take a man by justin klein by the name of justin klein that an enemy said that he was going to kill him to kill a cop that night but the angel the lord stood up for him stood in his way of five bullets that had every had every attention of killing that man but satan couldn't kill him because there was a little boy named silas that still had to come forth and satan thought that he would throw a blockade in front of the miracle of coming but there was an angel said that you're not coming no further hallelujah you got every reason you got every reason to press the battle you got every reason to move forward you got every reason to believe in miracles you got every reason to press forward you got every reason to believe in his name are you with me you're not the children of night you're the children of the day you were not predetermined so that you would live through laodicea and fell in laodicea but you'd move forward through laodicea and you come out on the other side not like judas but you come out on the other side when peter thought that they never when people thought that peter would never go forward they said that he'll be known as the man that denied jesus as a man that cussed that in his presence and said he didn't even know him he was a man that would stand there and give the inauguration speech paul would say in first thessalonians five and four go back to verse three but but for for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but brethren ye are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief but ye are the children of the light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for a helmet the hope of salvation for god and not other pointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ what brought you here what got you here something makes you get out of your car on a freezing cold night something makes you spend your money to be in the service something made you come and drive miles upon miles just to hear a voice what's driving you what's pushing you there's something laying there that you don't see it's that germ of life that's always pressing you forward and you look at rahab's life she'd let men in before but what was different about these two men why would she believe these two men why would she drop down a scarlet cord why would she trust them because something was pressing her forward why would ruth let a man tell her to stay in this field when everybody else was around and when the wheat was growing low when everything seemed like it was going impossible steak why would she listen to this man she had failures come by her way she had destruction come by her way but something was pressing her forward why would esther go into a palace that she knew she knew that if she went in there and the king didn't extend her scepter that she was rightfully dead what would press her into that into that court hallelujah what would press taymor to play the heart the part of a harlot when her husband died when his brothers wouldn't wouldn't wouldn't give her seed you understand what i'm saying what would press her to play the part of a harlot what would press her to say i've got to dress this way i've got to act this way so that i can receive seed that i might live can i dare say that redemption was at work that the ladies of grace that fill in the lineage of jesus christ that redemption was at work the tamar had to push forward it didn't make sense it didn't make sense to the message community what she was doing but redemption was pushing her to the spot that if she don't fulfill this part that the lineage of jesus christ is inadequate but there was something on the inside of her that was pressing her to receive seed what made you go out there and see see that man hear that message you've heard a great lot of speaking throughout the years but what made you listen to that voice what got your attention this is more than a man this is more than a prophet there's an angel with this message there's something different about the way he speaks good evening friends there's something different when he speaks to a patient and he recognizes now is this the basic there's something different about this man what's driving you when the rest of the world reasons and says we don't need it when the rest of the world says it was just a gift what is pushing you to hear this voice there's something on the inside of you that has to be extracted by the evening light what was driving tamar forward redemption was at work when you look at jesus's beginning of his ministry you look at luke chapter three and then you look at the lineage how it came down as it goes in reverse all the way to the end of chapter three how it came from jesus to david to obed jesse and all down through the lineage of seth there's adam and all these were the sons of god that there was something greater that work than the natural man could look at it was looking past what you see and thinking past what you think that the word of god was going to find a wound and it was going to bring forth life what would cause twins to fight in a woman when jacob looked at the birthright and said it's worth fighting for when tamar would produce twins and pharaohs and sarah when they were coming forth from the womb sarah broke his hand out first fourth and the and the handmaid and wrapped a scarlet cord around his hand and said this one came forth first and then he drawed his hand back and fair ass came forth first and said this breach be upon you but something was driving him driving him to a birthright something was pushing him that i've got to be i've got to get out i've got to get out because i know that my name is identified when you look at the lineage of jesus christ it's fair as his name first before zero because he was the one that the birthright was identified to something was pushing him forward what made you in this christmas season love him like you never loved him before something was pressing you forward what made you dedicate your life again something was pressing you forward what would make you say i'm not going to go back and do that no more i'm not gonna i'm not gonna look at that thing no more i'm not gonna walk that way no more i'm not gonna pick up that bottle no more i'm not gonna i'm not gonna communicate with those things no more i'm not going to let filthy communication come out of my mouth no more i'm not going to turn on that app no more i'm not going to turn that game on no more you follow what i'm saying what would make you make such a drastic change it's something pushing you forward and paul said all these things all the things i've learned in life are counted as done that i might win christ that is worth fighting for is worth living for let's stand this evening what would cause you to continue to anticipate is coming something's driving you something's pulling you the press towards the mark of the high calling we've had a witness that's amongst us the witness of the holy ghost that's brought miracles to pass people with sutton views for years receive the baptism of the holy ghost this year in a year of utter chaos in the midst of a pandemic this message is stronger than it's ever been before it's more vindicated than it's ever been before it's more translated than it's ever been before it's more believed in than it's ever been before and the people of god are moving forward with the power that is not their own but it's him god is with us i carry in my pocket tonight a knife that i got as a christmas gift has an inscription that god is with us i'm gonna carry it every time i preach and anytime the enemy stands up i have to i'll remind him that god is with us you can read between the lines but i'm not just carrying this just as a reminder that god is with us i know that god is with us but i'm carrying this for a very special purpose someone needs healing and i'm moving forward right into that healing every time i preach i'm preaching with this for healing every time david had a sling i got a knife but i got more than a knife i got an open book that says all things that the father has has given to me israel had a promised land that was sitting in front of them but it was never theirs until they stepped into it and moved forward to it let me say something daring just now maybe maybe not daring but but before there can be a baby come forth from a womb there's got to be somebody that believes and mary was that person mary was willing to stand against all the odds that was stacked up against her as she believed it let me say there's two miracles that are sitting in this place that are going to transpire and we're going to move forward into those things ron spencer's complete healing and anna thomas and jeffrey thomas's baby walking down that aisle and we cannot stay where we were in 2020. we have to move forward to a miracle we have to believe like never before we have to pray like never before we have to act like never before those things are in the natural but there are things that are hanging in the spiritual that are hanging over top of your life that you'll never get unless you believe unless you press pass in faith and say hey i can't see it but i believe it i don't know when it's gonna happen but i know it's gonna happen i can't understand what's transpiring but i know that it's transpiring i'm just crazy enough to believe to move forward into faith paul said nothing's going to separate me from the love of god nothing's going to separate me from this goal i'm going to press toward i'm going to move forward into it paul he could hear them sharpening the blade and he was still preaching we can hear as the devil is swearing out as he's swearing out his death threats we can hear him but we're just going to take god at his word and we're going to move forward into it let our knives be sharper than his tongue pressing on i'm gonna keep pressing on on and on and on i'm gonna keep pressing on i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher [Music] i'm gonna keep pressing on [Music] and i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher calling now [Music] satan tries to stop me and turn me aside [Music] well i just say satan oh that proves you were lying i'm going to keep pressing [Music] on you know i'm going keep pressing on i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher calling of [Music] tries to stop me and turn me aside it says there's no need for you to go home no need to try and even if there was a rapture you never make it in [Music] [Music] i'm gonna keep pressing [Music] and i'm gonna keep pressing on to the higher [Music] i'm going to keep pressing on to [Music] this evening i'm gonna keep [Music]
