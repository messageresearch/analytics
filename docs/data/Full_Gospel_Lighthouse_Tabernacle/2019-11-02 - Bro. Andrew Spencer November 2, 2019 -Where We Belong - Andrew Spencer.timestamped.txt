[4:24] control of this service from the glory
[4:26] of the Lord Jesus man any man if you
[4:32] have your Bibles this evening we're
[4:34] turning over in the book of Deuteronomy
[4:36] 29 and 29 and then down to Genesis
[4:40] chapter 12 and verse 1 and we want to
[4:44] continue with the thought that the Lord
[4:48] is placed on my heart on where where we
[4:51] belong where we belong sister-sister
[4:57] linda craigger was speaking to my wife
[5:00] last weekend and sister katie was asking
[5:03] her how how her week win and she said oh
[5:05] it's just been so good she said she said
[5:08] this is this is a place that I feel like
[5:10] I belong and this is the only place that
[5:12] has ever told me that this is where I
[5:14] belong I believe that I believe this is
[5:18] the place that we belong that church and
[5:20] the revealing of the son of man I
[5:22] believe that this is the hour that we're
[5:24] living in we're feeding not feeding on
[5:28] the mind of a man but we're feeding on
[5:31] the unfailing body word the son of man
[5:33] and as I said we'd like to speak to you
[5:36] on this autumn and where we belong the
[5:39] Bible says here is we've read it in the
[5:41] fat the past couple weekends that the
[5:44] secret things belong to the Lord our God
[5:46] but those things which are revealed to
[5:49] belong unto us and to our children
[5:52] forever that we may do all the words of
[5:55] this law Genesis chapter 12 and verse 1
[5:59] now the Lord that's
[6:04] unto Abram excuse me I'll allow you to
[6:09] find your places now the Lord had said
[6:14] unto Abram get thee out of thy country
[6:16] and from thy kindred and from thy
[6:19] father's house and unto a land that I
[6:21] will show thee and I will make a V a
[6:24] great nation and I will bless thee and
[6:26] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[6:29] blessing and I will bless them that
[6:32] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[6:35] thee and in thee shall all the families
[6:36] of the earth be blessed may God bless
[6:40] his word you may be seated in the
[6:41] presence of the Lord where we belong I
[6:46] believe that we are here I believe that
[6:48] these are the moments that we were
[6:50] destined for in life and I believe that
[6:54] this is where we belong in the hour that
[6:56] we're living in I believe that this
[6:58] message is him
[6:59] I believe that brother Branham did not
[7:02] come to vindicate himself but I believe
[7:03] that the prophet of the Lord
[7:05] perfectly proved our Lord Jesus Christ I
[7:08] believe that I believe that that this
[7:11] this word will put us right into a body
[7:13] change you know I find that I find a lot
[7:18] today that people just seem like they
[7:20] can't fit in somewhere but I found the
[7:22] place I have found the place where I
[7:24] belong you know you find it amongst
[7:27] people there sometimes searching out
[7:29] which way they need to go and and where
[7:31] they need to be in life but I have found
[7:33] the place where I belong at you know I
[7:36] know that I may repeat some things this
[7:38] evening that we've spoken the past or
[7:40] the past couple of weekends but I
[7:42] believe they bear repeating but I
[7:44] believe that that that we are seeing a
[7:46] young people as they're finding their
[7:48] position I believe that we're watching
[7:50] the Church of the Living God as they're
[7:52] coming to their position and and we know
[7:55] that that when the church knows
[7:56] therefore the position of what she is
[7:58] that the rapture will happen and we're
[8:01] we're watching these things manifest
[8:03] right in front of our eyes and we as we
[8:07] see here as we've read that we see God
[8:09] that God is giving Abram
[8:12] Amanda and a promise God is giving Abram
[8:15] a command to come out of the land in
[8:18] which he was born in a land that he has
[8:20] known all of his life he's giving him a
[8:22] command to come out of that land but
[8:24] he's giving him a promise he's giving
[8:26] him a promise to go to a land that he
[8:28] ain't ever seen before but I want you to
[8:30] notice the character of Abraham and the
[8:33] notice how how close that Abraham was to
[8:36] God that if you look from the transition
[8:39] from Genesis chapter 11 to Genesis
[8:41] chapter 12 that that has been calculated
[8:45] that there was four hundred and twenty
[8:46] years since God had opened his mouth and
[8:50] they spoke to know of these things and
[8:52] now here God is opening his mouth again
[8:54] to speak to his servant Abraham it is
[8:57] testifying of the life of which Abraham
[8:59] lived that he was ordained to be the
[9:02] father of Nations you see this command
[9:05] that God was giving to him to leave that
[9:08] place to leave that place of old and
[9:11] fond associations for a land which he
[9:14] had not seen he was sending him to a
[9:16] place or directing him by to a place of
[9:20] the unseen a place that he didn't know
[9:22] about he was going to a place that was
[9:24] prepared for a people you see God had
[9:27] told Abraham that I'm going to give you
[9:29] this land that it's your land if you
[9:32] look over in Genesis 13 he tells him to
[9:34] walk through that land that it's your
[9:36] land it belongs to you look to the north
[9:39] look to the south look everywhere all
[9:41] that you see I've given you that land
[9:43] it's your land it belongs to you it's
[9:46] your possession it's for your children
[9:48] and it's for your seed that's coming
[9:50] after them you know but the Bible says
[9:52] in Acts chapter 7 and 5 that Abraham
[9:55] never stood foot on that land but yet
[9:58] his seed after him stood on that land so
[10:01] Abraham stood on that land you see God's
[10:04] got a work for you to do if you go over
[10:07] and you look at it at Phillip at his
[10:09] revival when he was down there in
[10:11] Samaria you know that the prophet of the
[10:13] Lord said that when Jesus was speaking
[10:15] to the woman at a wail that Jesus never
[10:18] did one miracle there he just preached
[10:20] to them the Word of God because you
[10:22] realized the profit of the
[10:24] Lord said that there was a revival that
[10:26] was coming and it was a work of Philip
[10:29] that he was to do you know that there
[10:32] are things that that you are manifested
[10:34] and your promise to do these things
[10:38] belong to you tonight Church you see
[10:42] that he told him to walk through this
[10:43] land
[10:44] Abraham couldn't see all of it Abraham
[10:47] maybe as he was coming out of the land
[10:49] of his father he couldn't see the land
[10:51] which God was going to give him but he
[10:53] was not looking through the eyes of
[10:55] doubt he was looking through the eyes of
[10:57] faith he was looking at the purchased
[11:00] possession which God had given him and
[11:02] you know if I find sometimes as humans
[11:05] that we get caught up in the delay and
[11:07] we get caught up in the details of life
[11:09] we get caught up in those things and
[11:11] that's where the devil battles us is in
[11:14] the details what why hasn't God done
[11:17] this yet or why hasn't God moved yet he
[11:19] said that he would heal me he said that
[11:21] he would deliver me we get caught up in
[11:23] the details of time but God's Word is
[11:25] right on time he said that he's already
[11:28] healed you that by His stripes that
[11:30] you're already healed
[11:32] that's a sure word of prophecy for you
[11:34] it is just human here to hear the word
[11:37] that it will stir up your pure Minds by
[11:40] the way of remembrance that this word
[11:42] was giving to you that he's already said
[11:45] that he healed you that he's already
[11:46] celled that he that he said that he
[11:48] delivered you if God is not as good as
[11:52] his word we need to back off everything
[11:54] that he's written in this word but this
[11:57] belongs to you Church every promise in
[12:01] the book is mine every chapter every
[12:03] verse and every line every single one of
[12:06] them is there for me and the devil may
[12:08] try to keep me off of my property but
[12:10] this is what God has given done to me is
[12:15] that right so don't get caught up in the
[12:17] details and don't get caught up in the
[12:19] devil's handiwork where he tries to make
[12:21] you disbelieve and make you doubt but
[12:24] you hold on to God's promise God said he
[12:27] bring him in God's gonna bring them in
[12:28] God said it he'll yeah he's already
[12:31] he'll Chuck
[12:32] but may he quicken your faith to bring
[12:34] it up to a higher level so that you can
[12:37] soar into the heavenlies the devil wants
[12:40] to keep you down but we are knowing at
[12:42] church
[12:43] what are we anointed by by what Eve
[12:45] turned down
[12:47] we accept Oh hallelujah wants the
[12:51] anointed man now the anointed bride
[12:53] hallelujah we are in the hour of the
[12:57] anointing of a bride we have responded
[13:01] we are subjects to the bridegroom's call
[13:05] have you heard him calling out to you
[13:10] you know God is the one that gave the
[13:12] promise hallelujah
[13:16] man didn't make this promise do you
[13:19] think Abraham as a human being dealing
[13:22] with the five senses that you have to
[13:24] deal with could see it in his own human
[13:27] natural realm that he was living in
[13:30] could see a land in which he was born
[13:32] to possess he could not see it in the
[13:35] five senses but faith is the sixth sense
[13:40] God was the one that gave the promise to
[13:43] Abraham and to his seed after them but
[13:46] the promise remained no matter what
[13:49] Abraham went through he went through old
[13:52] age and the promise remained he went
[13:58] through maybe different trials of his
[14:00] life of the promise remained and God
[14:02] would tell him that his seed was secured
[14:05] in a strange land and the promise
[14:07] remained through all the patriarchs of
[14:11] Abraham it remained through Isaac it
[14:14] remained through Jacob it remained for
[14:18] Joseph it remained the promise was there
[14:21] and then there rose above Pharaoh which
[14:24] knew not Joseph and the promise still
[14:27] remained 400 years of slavery and the
[14:32] promise still remained 400 years of the
[14:36] devil trying to beat the promise out of
[14:38] them but the promise still remain 400
[14:41] years where they would stand there and
[14:43] try to knock
[14:45] can destroy the image of God and destroy
[14:48] the promise of God and try to beat it
[14:50] out of their memory but the promise
[14:53] still remains when they were getting
[14:55] down while they were there getting
[14:57] whipped while they were down there
[14:58] making bricks while they were down there
[15:00] marching in the mud the promise still
[15:03] remained it may look like it ain't
[15:05] coming but I want you to know he's away
[15:07] maker he's a miracle worker
[15:10] he's a promise keeper the promise is on
[15:13] its way the promise still remains
[15:18] whether you got cancer the promise still
[15:21] remains whether he got sugar diabetes
[15:23] he's the LORD thy God that heals all of
[15:26] that diseases the promise still remains
[15:31] [Applause]
[15:36] through the beatings through the scourge
[15:39] ins the promise still remain and Satan
[15:43] done his very worst to beat it out of
[15:46] the children of his flock he tried his
[15:50] very best to destroy this bride but he
[15:52] couldn't keep her down Satan done his
[15:56] worst but the promise still remained you
[15:59] see because there may have been some
[16:01] people that died but there may have been
[16:03] some people that didn't believe but the
[16:04] promise still remains there was a Joshua
[16:07] that rose up and said this is our land
[16:10] the promise is ours the promises to
[16:13] Abraham seen and we are Abraham's seed
[16:16] it belongs to us if Joshua could stand
[16:21] there and just have the anointing of the
[16:24] Holy Ghost come and go what about us
[16:26] tonight what about us that are born
[16:29] against sons and daughters of God does
[16:31] the promise still remain for us
[16:36] the devil may with you around but does
[16:38] the promise still remain the devil make
[16:41] torment you on your job but does the
[16:43] promise still remain a little earlier
[16:48] for the people of the land
[16:55] were the people of the land America is
[17:00] my home country this land is our land
[17:05] this lands worth fighting for reason we
[17:08] can stand here worship like we do is
[17:10] because there was somebody that went
[17:11] before us that believed in the same
[17:14] promise that America was a land that a
[17:16] land of the free and the home of the
[17:18] brave that was somebody that thought
[17:21] that it was worth fighting for
[17:22] they thought it was worth dying for you
[17:26] see if you don't think it's not for you
[17:28] we'll back up but if you believe it's
[17:30] worth dying for
[17:31] you give you all to it and there were
[17:33] some that gave some and some gave all
[17:36] the reason we stand here as a free
[17:38] nation is because somebody thought that
[17:41] this was their land come on somebody
[17:44] when Germany tried to take it when
[17:46] resume trying to take it this was
[17:48] America's land and somebody rose up and
[17:51] said I'll fight for this land what about
[17:53] the children of God and said this is our
[17:56] land let the devil come this is our land

[31:37] and we know that it'll be there
[31:39] it's a promise to us turn with me to
[31:43] revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 my
[31:51] businness awe in the right hand of him
[31:53] that sat on the throne a book written
[31:54] within and on the backside on the
[32:00] backside sealed with seven seals and I
[32:02] saw strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[32:05] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[32:08] to loose the seals thereof and no man in
[32:11] heaven nor an earth nor under the earth
[32:13] was able to open the book neither to
[32:15] look thereon and I wept much because no
[32:18] man was found worthy to open and to read
[32:23] the book neither to look thereon it
[32:29] imagined how John is feeling right here
[32:32] after seeing his name on the book and
[32:34] there's nobody worthy to step up they
[32:39] looked all over the earth and there was
[32:41] nobody worthy and he began to weep much
[32:44] because there was nobody that was found
[32:45] worthy and verse 5 it says then one of
[32:49] the elders say them to me we've not
[32:52] behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[32:55] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[32:57] the book
[33:00] Alleluia to Lambs job and to loose the
[33:04] seven seals thereof and be and I beheld
[33:07] and lo in the midst of the throne as a
[33:08] four and the four beasts and in the
[33:10] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[33:15] had been slain having seven horns and
[33:17] seven eyes which are seven spirits of
[33:20] God sent forth in all the earth and he
[33:22] came and took the book
[33:24] out of the right hand of him that set up
[33:26] on the throne and when he had taken the
[33:28] book the four beasts and four and twenty
[33:30] elders fell down before the lamb having
[33:32] every one of them harps and golden vials
[33:35] full of odours which are in the prayers
[33:37] which are the prayers of saints and they
[33:41] sung a new song oh yeah they say the new
[33:47] song they believe the ageless the elders
[33:51] believed in singing a new song and they
[33:53] sing a new song saying thou art worthy
[33:56] to take the book and they open the seals
[33:59] thereof there was our slain and has
[34:03] redeemed us to God by the blood of out
[34:06] of every kindred and tongue and people
[34:09] and nation you talking about a time when
[34:13] John saw this when he was caught up this
[34:17] was in symbolism of what the lamb has
[34:20] released in this day and the lamb stood
[34:23] up and said I am worthy to claim the
[34:26] book I'm worthy to claim those names
[34:29] that are on that book and John said all
[34:33] things in heaven all things under the
[34:35] earth heard me shouting blessings glory
[34:38] honor and power you talking about a
[34:40] certain service you think we have one
[34:43] here what about old John in symbolism of
[34:46] you and me when we realize that our
[34:48] names are on the book and he hath
[34:50] redeemed us it makes me want to shout
[34:56] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[35:00] oh no I don't believe that John was
[35:03] saying it like that if John was singing
[35:06] that song it makes me wanna shout
[35:09] [Applause]
[35:16] hallelujah hallelujah and this line of
[35:26] the tribe of juda prevailed he said
[35:28] don't weep John for the Lion of the
[35:30] tribe of Judah and the root of David
[35:32] hath prevailed
[35:33] he's already overcome he's done it it's
[35:36] over John Luke he prevailed over death
[35:42] he prevailed and walked out of the grave
[35:45] I'm identified with him and as the song
[35:48] says if he walked out of the grave I'm
[35:50] walking - if he walked out I'm walking -
[35:56] if he overcame I'm overcoming to hell oh
[36:01] yeah that's my headship right there
[36:04] that's my king right there that's my
[36:07] Lord right there if he walked out I'm
[36:09] walking to I'm not stayin bound by the
[36:12] grave and dead bound by death I'm
[36:15] walking out of it the lamb has redeemed
[36:19] us back he's redeemed us Mac he took us
[36:26] out of the devil's pawn shop he paid the
[36:30] debt you ain't got to pay for it you
[36:33] ain't gotta beat yourself over and over
[36:35] over again because the things that
[36:36] you've done in your past stop beating
[36:39] yourself stop talking about the things
[36:43] that you used to do and the things of
[36:45] your past start talking about your
[36:47] future in God I don't care what you did
[36:50] while you is out there in the world my
[36:52] ears are not ears of trash
[36:54] my ears are to be things of glory and
[36:58] honor and praise to the king yeah I was
[37:02] lost but I ain't lost no more yeah I was
[37:05] a sinner but I ain't a sinner no more I
[37:07] don't even belong identify with that man
[37:13] but people love they love talking about
[37:17] their past because they enjoy their past
[37:19] more than they enjoy their future
[37:23] that was free
[37:27] you see redemption means all illegal
[37:29] possessing to all that was lost by Adam
[37:31] and Eve brother Adam said Oh home I'll
[37:34] what that ought to do to a born-again
[37:36] Christian
[37:37] you see it's legal possessing to the
[37:40] abstract title deed the abstract deed
[37:42] title deed of eternal life means that
[37:45] you possess everything say everything
[37:47] that Adam and Eve lost the possession of
[37:51] that deed Adam could not meet the
[37:53] requirements of redemption after he'd
[37:55] found that he lost it he'd sin and he'd
[37:58] separated himself from God and was on
[37:59] this side of the chasm so he could not
[38:02] redeem it he just couldn't do it
[38:04] because he was needed he needed a
[38:06] redemption himself so he couldn't do it
[38:08] but the lamb stood up and he took the
[38:12] book of title and he took it from the
[38:14] right hand of him that set up on a
[38:15] throne to claim his redemptive to claim
[38:18] his rights to claim for me and you what
[38:21] he redeemed us from back to everything
[38:23] that Adam lost in the Garden of Eden he
[38:26] redeemed us back to that he redeemed us
[38:30] back to the half when Eve said I want to
[38:33] move that mountain out of the way
[38:35] because I can't see he redeemed you back
[38:37] to that and you have the authority and
[38:39] the right to speak to your Mountain he
[38:46] redeemed the lamb took the book that had
[38:50] your name on it saying I'm claiming
[38:53] these as mine they're mine
[38:57] they belong to me it's one thing for you
[39:00] to say I belong to God but when god
[39:02] almighty says you belong to me
[39:14] God's saying they belong to me I want
[39:18] you to search later on I want you to
[39:20] search revelations chapter 5 this is
[39:23] story they say this is symbolism of you
[39:28] but I want you to find Satan in that
[39:31] picture you're not gonna find him and
[39:34] you're only going to find the Redeem
[39:36] you're going to find the type of the
[39:38] bride you're going to find the 24 elders
[39:41] and you go find the lamb you're going to
[39:44] find a strong angel there but you will
[39:45] not find Satan in the picture in
[39:47] Revelation chapter 5 you can search it
[39:50] over you can look over and the lamb is
[39:52] saying that these belong to me
[39:55] they're rightfully mine and you have the
[39:57] authorities say what about that Satan
[39:59] you're not even in the picture no more
[40:02] you have accused me day in and day out
[40:05] what about it Satan I belong to God they
[40:10] thought I was worth dying for Satan what
[40:12] about it he thought I was worth getting
[40:15] beat over so that I could be healed
[40:17] what about it Satan you remember that
[40:21] brother Seth what about that Satan what
[40:24] about this precious blood what about his
[40:28] mercy what about his healing touch what
[40:31] about his deliverance you've been chosen
[40:36] you've been called you've been elected
[40:39] you belong in the land of the Holy
[40:43] Spirit he belong in the land of
[40:45] Revelation and you have been chosen to
[40:47] tear satan's kingdom down you know the
[40:55] military has a statement that there's no
[40:57] truer representation of a country than
[41:00] the people that it sends into the field
[41:02] to fight for it there's no truer
[41:07] representation of a country than the
[41:10] people that it sins to fight for it
[41:15] you were born to fight this battle you
[41:18] were born to win this battle
[41:20] you're a true representation of the
[41:22] country that you came
[41:23] from you see you see you have
[41:26] representation from predestination you
[41:29] see the things the reason why catches
[41:31] your attentions and it ain't catching a
[41:33] priest down the roads attention and why
[41:35] it's taking hold in your life is because
[41:37] you have representation there is no true
[41:42] representation of a country than the
[41:44] people they send to fight for it God
[41:47] must think a lot about you he sent you
[41:50] here to take over Laodicea not for
[41:52] Laodicea to take over you
[41:54] not for Laodicea to take over your
[41:57] prayer life for you to take your prayer
[41:59] life and take over Laodicea stop
[42:02] allowing Laodicea to slip in and tell
[42:04] you that you belong to Laodicea
[42:06] I don't belong to Laodicea I may come
[42:09] through Laodicea I may live in this
[42:11] Laodicean age but I don't belong to lay
[42:13] on us here I'm like Jeremiah there's
[42:18] fire shut up in my bones I don't belong
[42:20] to the devil and the devil don't belong
[42:23] to me
[42:23] that's what he's wrong about in this day
[42:25] is because it's being revealed to a
[42:28] people that they don't belong to a devil
[42:31] [Applause]
[42:35] will the devil don't like no praise and
[42:38] not around
[42:40] [Music]
[42:41] I've never no like no talking my
[42:43] revelations around here
[42:46] revelation beats the devil back and
[42:48] forth every which way from Sunday and
[42:52] it'll still beat him next Sunday until
[42:56] we leave this world this word would have
[42:59] feit Satan anytime anyplace anywhere
[43:04] Reina sign his own time God his own time
[43:10] hallelujah let's move on just a moment
[43:19] your God is fighting their battles for
[43:22] you I love listening to sister Elena
[43:26] butts testimony if she's telling that
[43:29] later she said it's God really fighting
[43:32] my battles I can't see him fighting my
[43:34] battles but God began to reveal to her
[43:37] that he's the LORD thy God that fighting
[43:40] your battles you may not see him
[43:42] fighting your battles but I want you to
[43:43] know he's fighting your battles he said
[43:47] he would not leave you comfortless it's
[43:49] in the cover to come by you he come to
[43:52] minister to your life he knows what
[43:54] you're going through
[43:55] he knows the pain of your past he knows
[43:57] everything you're going through he's the
[44:00] god that's fighting your battles I sent
[44:02] to the family this week of Isaiah 58 and
[44:04] eight that the Bible says that the glory
[44:07] of the Lord would go before you and the
[44:09] glory of the Lord would be your rear
[44:11] award that means that he's got your six
[44:13] and he's got your 12 God's got my front
[44:19] God's got my back we look over in the
[44:26] Bible in Genesis chapter 22 look up your
[44:31] seat belts we're gonna be much longer
[44:33] tonight when we see that where God made
[44:38] Abraham a promise after providing a
[44:41] sacrifice there that that RAM that was
[44:44] caught in the thicket that God made a
[44:46] promise to Abraham remember the promise
[44:49] remained until this
[44:50] day it does not falter right the vision
[44:55] and make it plain so that then that
[44:57] readeth may run with it
[44:59] the visions been made plain before you
[45:02] don't get caught up in the devil's
[45:04] details don't get caught up in this in
[45:07] is in his ideas of doubt and fear don't
[45:10] get caught up in those saying the vision
[45:12] has been made plain you just run with it
[45:15] he told that you is going to have a baby
[45:17] you run with that he told you that your
[45:20] seed was coming back run with it it's
[45:24] been made plain before you I didn't make
[45:27] it but Iran didn't make it the Bible the
[45:30] God of the Bible said it
[45:32] let the god that wrote the word let him
[45:35] so forth and prove that he's the one
[45:37] that wrote it
[45:40] [Applause]
[45:47] it didn't look like he was ever going to
[45:49] come back but he came back dead and he
[45:51] says this is the land that we belong in
[45:56] where God is calling his produções back
[45:59] home
[45:59] and God will not lose one of his seat
[46:03] and God made a promise to Abraham that
[46:07] thy seed shall possess the gate of its
[46:10] enemies that promise is to you and you
[46:13] are heirs of the throne you're an heir
[46:15] of the promise hallelujah
[46:19] you can look over in a book of Galatians
[46:21] chapter 3 and it talks about you that
[46:24] you are not of the Jew and not of the
[46:25] Greek but you are of God to move
[46:30] somebody before I was ever the son of
[46:33] Ronald Spitzer ah what's the son of
[46:35] Almighty God I'm the heir to everything
[46:39] that he owns thy seed shall possess the
[46:44] gate of its enemies that means all of
[46:48] the enemy's strength all of its troops
[46:51] all of its counsels all of its fortified
[46:54] cities you possess that gate you will
[46:58] possess that gate it's not an if but you
[47:02] will possess that gate it's saying that
[47:04] you're going to take ownership of the
[47:06] gate of the enemy and you're going to do
[47:07] with it what's your please Jesus said in
