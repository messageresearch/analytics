[44:41] speak in it all fear leaves when you
[44:45] begin to speak
[44:46] the most holy name there is hallelujah
[44:51] we certainly want to be speaking the
[44:53] name of jesus christ
[44:55] over sister karen pruitt just now and
[44:58] she's in desperate need of a of a touch
[45:01] from the lord
[45:03] and i believe i believe god's more than
[45:05] able when
[45:06] and we don't know what is we don't know
[45:09] what his plan is
[45:10] but we just know that that we're in it
[45:14] and at nine o'clock our time tonight
[45:17] brother tim and brother timothy are
[45:19] headed to the hospital to pray for
[45:20] sister karen lay hands on her
[45:23] and so uh at that time if
[45:27] if we're out of service by that time or
[45:29] in service we'll just
[45:30] we're just going to join with them in
[45:32] prayer we're praying we've been praying
[45:35] all week been praying over this whole
[45:36] situation and
[45:37] this is not this is no surprise to god
[45:41] and i'm just thankful to be in his his
[45:43] plan in this all and
[45:45] that's the consolation that we take in
[45:47] times like this
[45:48] is knowing that he's got it
[45:52] and uh i certainly enjoyed that song
[45:56] that the uh
[45:57] that the hills and the shiplets thing
[45:59] this evening and
[46:01] i can tell you about a jesus that that
[46:04] heals
[46:05] from from somebody that was brain dead
[46:09] and he's our pastor
[46:12] so nothing's nothing's too hard for our
[46:15] god there's nothing too impossible and
[46:18] we just believe for the impossible and
[46:21] when things come against us like this we
[46:24] we just hold on we hold on to those
[46:26] promises and
[46:28] and so we we're going to do the same in
[46:29] this moment right now
[46:31] we're going to hold on hold on until the
[46:34] storm is over
[46:36] you know we we bring much consolation or
[46:39] gather much consolation from the thought
[46:41] that
[46:41] that here this pulpit a few weeks ago
[46:43] that that god said i i'm coming down to
[46:46] deliver and
[46:47] and you know we just know that he's that
[46:51] he's come and he and what a peace that
[46:53] that brings
[46:54] a comfort knowing that god has come down
[46:57] to deliver
[46:58] amen amen maybe we just sing that song
[47:01] his eyes on the sparrow
[47:05] i know the enemy is real upset so we
[47:08] just want to
[47:09] set an atmosphere i believe it's already
[47:11] set but even to
[47:13] control my my own emotions just now
[47:16] i want to yield completely to the lord
[47:19] and ask for a touch
[47:21] for sister karen for the body of jesus
[47:24] christ
[47:25] also brother tim just now that the lord
[47:28] would minister
[47:28] through him i believe that there is
[47:31] power
[47:32] in human vessels and when the bible said
[47:36] that they shall lay hands on the sick
[47:38] and they shall recover i believe he was
[47:40] referring to us
[47:42] i believe brother tim is a real general
[47:45] of this army
[47:47] a real god called man and we've seen god
[47:51] work through him
[47:52] and i have said this to him and across
[47:55] the world if
[47:56] if you're in bad if you're in bad case
[47:59] in a bad situation
[48:01] and brother tim goes to praying
[48:04] god moves we don't know how he'll move
[48:07] but we know he'll move
[48:09] so let's just sing his song his eyes on
[48:11] the sparrow this evening
[48:20] i'm happy
[48:21] [Music]

[49:31] [Music]
[49:38] the space
[49:46] [Music]
[49:55] amen what a powerful thought to know
[49:58] that god is watching
[50:00] if you have your bibles this evening
[50:01] we'd like to look in the book
[50:03] of genesis chapter 1
[50:07] and also down to genesis chapter 16
[50:11] and verse 6 this evening and in the book
[50:14] of genesis
[50:16] if you don't know where it's at
[50:20] it's at the beginning of the book
[50:26] so we'll start out at the book
[50:30] at the beginning so it's not too hard
[50:32] for you to find
[50:36] i'm just trying to settle myself
[50:41] i'd like to speak to you tonight on
[50:47] i'd like to speak to you tonight on the
[50:48] god who sees
[50:50] the god who sees
[50:54] the bible says here in the beginning
[50:57] god created the heaven and the earth and
[51:00] the earth was without
[51:01] form and void and darkness was upon the
[51:05] face of the deep
[51:06] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[51:09] face of the waters
[51:10] and god said let there be light and
[51:14] there
[51:14] was light and god saw the light
[51:18] that it was good and god divided the
[51:21] light
[51:22] from the darkness as you're turning to
[51:25] genesis chapter 16. brother branham
[51:28] would draw a context a lot of times
[51:30] and would bring it to our attention that
[51:33] that before there could be a
[51:34] materialization there had to be a word
[51:37] and before there was a word it had to be
[51:39] a thought
[51:40] and what god has spoken will be
[51:44] no matter what the promise is god
[51:47] sees his promise and god is obligated to
[51:51] it
[51:57] genesis chapter 16 and verse 6.
[52:06] but abram said unto sarah
[52:10] behold thy maid is in thy hand to do
[52:12] [Music]
[52:15] is in thy hand do to her as it pleaseth
[52:17] thee
[52:19] and when sarah dealt hardly with her she
[52:22] fled from her face
[52:24] now just to just to bring it to your
[52:27] mind and to understand where we're going
[52:30] through the scripture you remember
[52:33] that this was the woman
[52:36] because of because of
[52:40] sarah's impatience this is the woman
[52:43] that was that was chosen
[52:48] and brought in to bring forth life
[52:51] because she said god hath restrained
[52:54] my wound but
[52:58] notice when she begins to
[53:01] begins to when the seed begins to grab a
[53:04] hold of
[53:05] sarah begins to get very roth but notice
[53:08] in verse 7 the bible said and the angel
[53:11] of the lord
[53:12] found her by a fountain of water in the
[53:16] wilderness
[53:17] by the fountain in the way of sure which
[53:20] is on the way to
[53:21] egypt and he said hagar
[53:25] sarah's maid once came as thou
[53:28] and wence wither will thou go and she
[53:31] said i flee
[53:32] from the face of my mistress sarah
[53:36] and the angel the lord said unto her
[53:37] return to thy mistress and submit
[53:39] thyself under her hands and the angel
[53:42] the lord said unto her i will multiply
[53:44] thy seed exceedingly
[53:46] that it shall not be numbered for
[53:48] multitude
[53:50] and the angel lord said unto her behold
[53:52] thou art with child and shall bear a son
[53:55] i shall call his name
[53:56] ishmael because the lord hath heard
[54:00] thy affliction and he will be a wild man
[54:03] and his
[54:04] hand will be against every man and every
[54:06] man's hand against him
[54:08] and he shall dwell in the presence of
[54:11] all his brethren
[54:13] and she called the name of the lord that
[54:16] spake unto her
[54:18] thou god sees me
[54:21] for she said have i also here looked
[54:24] after him that seeth me
[54:27] wherefore the well was called beer
[54:29] lahore
[54:32] behold it is between qadesh and beret
[54:36] let's just speak to the author of the
[54:40] word
[54:42] father we know that you are very near
[54:44] just now
[54:46] and we know that when you come
[54:51] it is to vindicate your promise
[54:54] and lord we are very aware
[54:57] that before there can be authority it
[55:00] has to be traced back
[55:02] to the author father we have traced back
[55:06] this authority of the word of god all
[55:09] the way back to see
[55:10] that you are the author of the promises
[55:14] and we stand here as your children
[55:16] knowing
[55:17] that we have all power in heaven
[55:21] when it was placed in us with a seed of
[55:24] the germ of god
[55:26] and that you did not keep that power to
[55:29] yourself but you placed it in human
[55:31] vessels that emptied out themselves
[55:34] that they might be the temple of the
[55:36] most high god
[55:39] father we're very aware that you are
[55:42] seeing
[55:42] through us tonight lord we're reminded
[55:46] that
[55:46] in this day we have seen you stand
[55:49] and read the very thoughts and intents
[55:52] of the heart
[55:52] of your children and lord i'd ask
[55:56] just now that that you would read
[55:59] lord not just our lives but i pray that
[56:02] you would speak to us about our future
[56:05] and i ask lord for the needs of the body
[56:08] just now
[56:10] that you would minister supernaturally
[56:12] to them father
[56:14] the spot that sister karen is in is a
[56:17] spot that only you can bring her out of
[56:20] now father we know that you're a healer
[56:22] and we know that you're a waymaker
[56:24] we know that you're a promise keeper
[56:27] lord and we stand firmly upon the
[56:29] authority of the word of god
[56:31] that you're the same yesterday today and
[56:33] forever
[56:35] and lord we just ask as your children
[56:37] you have heard our petitions we've laid
[56:39] them before your feet
[56:41] and we ask lord that you would see these
[56:43] things
[56:44] we've not brought them before a weak god
[56:47] we have brought them before the almighty
[56:49] el shaddai the breasted one that we can
[56:53] draw from
[56:54] lord i pray that you would give strength
[56:57] to the weak just
[56:58] now and i pray father that as the word
[57:01] goes forth
[57:02] may you speak to your children speak
[57:05] individually
[57:06] live to ear to us as we know that you're
[57:09] passing by this way in the name of jesus
[57:13] christ
[57:13] we pray these things amen amen may god
[57:17] bless you
[57:18] this evening we'd like we just like to
[57:24] we'd like to just say that god is here
[57:28] and as i said we'd like to speak to you
[57:31] on the god
[57:32] who sees and i personally have never
[57:35] ever taken a text along this way and
[57:40] when god began to deal with my heart
[57:42] early this week about this subject
[57:45] i i felt so pushed
[57:49] to to go this way and i don't really
[57:51] know and i don't even understand
[57:53] all things but i believe that he's in it
[57:56] and i believe that that one of the
[57:59] greatest things that
[58:00] everyone setting here amongst us little
[58:03] children old
[58:04] that the thing that we're taught of
[58:06] probably one of the most
[58:08] powerful themes that we were taught or
[58:10] the principle themes that we were taught
[58:12] as
[58:12] children is that god sees us and
[58:15] before we just the just the ability as a
[58:19] child
[58:19] as soon as that child is able to or has
[58:22] the cognitive skills or the ability to
[58:24] be able to retain
[58:25] we as parents begin to tell our children
[58:28] that god sees and
[58:29] that god watches over us and what a
[58:32] consolation that that
[58:33] is to know that there is nothing that's
[58:35] coming
[58:36] and there's nothing that is going or
[58:39] nothing in our future that god
[58:41] cannot see he he's seen us through our
[58:44] trials
[58:44] he sees us before we ever get to them
[58:47] and you remember when brother branham
[58:49] would talk about that
[58:50] eagle up there on that mountain how that
[58:52] how that she was
[58:53] how that she was up there and she had
[58:55] taken her eaglets down into that little
[58:57] valley down there and
[58:59] and and she was watching them and she
[59:01] went way up onto the
[59:03] upon the mountain and she was looking
[59:04] down in the valley and he said if a
[59:06] coyote would take after
[59:07] those little eaglets they would have
[59:09] mother eagle on their hands to deal with
[59:11] and to think that if that if a mother or
[59:14] eagle would have that kind of instinct
[59:16] that was
[59:16] that was placed in her by god almighty
[59:19] how much more should
[59:20] should we trust in the promises of god
[59:22] knowing that
[59:23] that god is an omnipotent god and that
[59:26] and that god is omniscient he knows all
[59:28] things he
[59:29] he understands all things he has a
[59:31] universal knowledge of
[59:33] of all things he sees all things he is
[59:36] the omniscient god and and in the
[59:38] masterpiece brother branham said that
[59:40] the omniscient
[59:41] he is omniscient which makes him
[59:43] omnipresent
[59:44] and he knows all things but in order to
[59:47] be a being he has to be
[59:48] in one being by being omniscient he can
[59:51] be omnipresent
[59:52] because he knows all things and knowed
[59:55] it before he know before the world began
[59:57] how many fleas lice how many bugs and
[1:00:00] how many times they bat their eyes and
[1:00:02] everything about it
[1:00:03] because he's omnipresent because you
[1:00:06] can't be omniscient or omniscient
[1:00:08] without being
[1:00:08] infinite and there's one thing infinite
[1:00:10] and that's god
[1:00:12] and you see we can rest assure knowing
[1:00:15] that
[1:00:15] god knows all things can he say amen to
[1:00:18] the word of god this evening
[1:00:20] and knowing that he is in control of all
[1:00:23] things and
[1:00:24] i believe that the god of all the
[1:00:26] prophets is still right here amongst us
[1:00:29] and
[1:00:29] i believe that that same pillar of fire
[1:00:31] that that led the children of israel
[1:00:34] that
[1:00:34] that was ever seeing and knowing what
[1:00:36] they were going to have to go through
[1:00:37] before they ever went through it
[1:00:39] is still here i believe that the god of
[1:00:42] elijah is still here and he still heals
[1:00:45] he still heals both bodies soul and
[1:00:48] spirit
[1:00:49] i believe that he's a full gospel man i
[1:00:51] believe that he's full of power
[1:00:53] i believe that he is the omnipotent the
[1:00:56] god
[1:00:56] of all power i believe that he is the
[1:00:59] omniscient the god all-knowing
[1:01:01] and i believe that makes him omnipresent
[1:01:04] the same yesterday
[1:01:05] today and forever and just before
[1:01:08] god declared that in the scripture that
[1:01:11] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:01:13] forever
[1:01:14] he declared it in hebrews 13 and 5 that
[1:01:16] i will never leave you
[1:01:18] and i will never forsake you and i don't
[1:01:21] believe it's just a little elementary
[1:01:23] thought for children
[1:01:24] tonight but i believe that it's a great
[1:01:25] thought that even though we
[1:01:27] we've been become scholars in the
[1:01:29] message but to know
[1:01:30] that the eyes of the lord are upon his
[1:01:33] children
[1:01:34] and just to think about that to to know
[1:01:36] that that the god
[1:01:38] that wrote the bible is the god that is
[1:01:40] going to see you through the promises
[1:01:42] and
[1:01:43] and i can make you a promise tonight and
[1:01:45] i could try to take you all the way
[1:01:47] through that
[1:01:48] but to know that the all-knowing god
[1:01:50] that knows
[1:01:51] what you're gonna get through and go
[1:01:53] through and be going through
[1:01:54] in the future and in the present through
[1:01:56] the promise because the promise was
[1:01:59] before you got in trouble and the
[1:02:01] promise is after you got in trouble
[1:02:03] and he is jehovah shama the lord
[1:02:06] that is already there before you ever
[1:02:09] got in trouble
[1:02:10] he is already there david said be he
[1:02:12] said if i make my bed in the hail thou
[1:02:15] art there if i climb to the heavens
[1:02:17] thou art there you're not getting past
[1:02:19] god tonight you can't you can't get past
[1:02:22] his greatness
[1:02:23] you can't understand how wonderful he is
[1:02:26] but it is my objective in this life
[1:02:29] to lift him up so high that when i lift
[1:02:31] him up as high as i can go
[1:02:33] that there is still no way that we can
[1:02:36] reach how great he is
[1:02:38] but to know that the god of the bible
[1:02:40] has said that i have seen you
[1:02:44] it doesn't matter how insignificant you
[1:02:46] feel or how unimportant
[1:02:48] you feel god is wanting to tell you
[1:02:51] that i'm seeing you and the bible would
[1:02:54] teach us and
[1:02:55] we as parents or i remember when my
[1:02:57] parents and my grandparents would take
[1:02:59] me and set me up on their knee
[1:03:01] and they would tell us that the eyes of
[1:03:02] the lord are watching over you now
[1:03:04] sometimes as parents you use that as a
[1:03:06] fear tactic
[1:03:07] to know that to make them know that god
[1:03:09] is watching over you you'll be careful
[1:03:12] little feet where you go for the father
[1:03:15] up above is looking down in love but
[1:03:17] we know that the bible teaches us that
[1:03:20] in proverbs 15 and 3 that the eyes of
[1:03:23] the lord
[1:03:23] are in every place beholding the evil
[1:03:27] and the good also in second chronicles
[1:03:29] in 16 for the
[1:03:31] eyes of the lord run to and fro
[1:03:33] throughout the whole earth
[1:03:34] to show himself strong in the behalf of
[1:03:37] them
[1:03:38] whose heart is perfect toward him
[1:03:41] and to think that the eyes of the lord
[1:03:43] are running over this land
[1:03:45] and looking out upon the situations of
[1:03:47] laodicea
[1:03:48] and if there's one thing that i would
[1:03:50] say god is watching what's going on in
[1:03:53] congress
[1:03:54] god is watching what's going on in our
[1:03:56] in our school systems god is watching
[1:03:58] what's happening in your homes
[1:04:00] and to think that the eyes of the lord
[1:04:03] the eyes of the lord
[1:04:04] are are watching over you through every
[1:04:07] situation
[1:04:08] and you might think how in the world are
[1:04:10] we going to get through this layout of
[1:04:11] seeing age and
[1:04:12] wonder how we're going to get through
[1:04:14] and pass the pass through these things
[1:04:16] and overcome every sickness and
[1:04:18] overcome every temptation don't you
[1:04:20] worry god
[1:04:21] is going to see you through and to think
[1:04:25] that the eyes of god
[1:04:26] are watching you because the if you go
[1:04:28] to studying out the
[1:04:30] eye the eye of humanity it is one of the
[1:04:33] most incredible studies that
[1:04:35] that that science has even done today i
[1:04:38] i
[1:04:38] said in i sat in a in a doctor's office
[1:04:41] one time and he began to
[1:04:42] he began to look into my eyes and then
[1:04:44] he began to take pictures and different
[1:04:45] things and he was showing me
[1:04:47] what the eye looked like and all the
[1:04:49] different nerves and everything and he
[1:04:50] was showing my personal eye and he was
[1:04:52] saying that
[1:04:53] he said he said because you don't have
[1:04:55] these things in there
[1:04:56] he said it proves that you have a
[1:04:58] healthy eye and as i was looking there i
[1:05:01] looked at him i said well that right
[1:05:02] there is proof to me
[1:05:04] that there's a god that created us you
[1:05:07] see when you go to begin to look at the
[1:05:09] eye that god
[1:05:10] is the creator of all things and
[1:05:13] and that would shut down every big bang
[1:05:16] theory there is
[1:05:17] that the god that created all of the
[1:05:20] cells that go into the eye
[1:05:22] when you go to looking at the eye there
[1:05:24] are things that are called cone cells
[1:05:26] and there's about seven million of those
[1:05:28] cone cells
[1:05:29] that are designated in the central spot
[1:05:31] of the retina
[1:05:32] that is designed to be able to show
[1:05:34] forth a a
[1:05:36] sharp vision and bring out the bring out
[1:05:39] things and transport it
[1:05:41] into your brain to say that that is an
[1:05:44] image
[1:05:44] you see psych impacts the most and
[1:05:47] imparts
[1:05:48] the most vivid and extensive knowledge
[1:05:51] you see if you were a blind person and i
[1:05:54] would tell you certain details about
[1:05:56] characteristics of somebody
[1:05:58] you wouldn't be able to understand like
[1:06:00] seeing
[1:06:01] because when you see something just at a
[1:06:03] quick glance
[1:06:04] your mind is able to grab things and
[1:06:07] your memories able to hold on to it
[1:06:10] and it builds a more definitive thing in
[1:06:12] your mind
[1:06:13] than any description ever can
[1:06:17] and i begin to think about this about
[1:06:19] this fault and i begin to think what
[1:06:21] the attack that brother ron has went
[1:06:23] through and i'm sorry for
[1:06:25] for bringing up and i'm not making heirs
[1:06:28] or trying to make something out of
[1:06:30] out of brother ron's sickness but i
[1:06:31] believe that that god allows
[1:06:33] us to look look at at trials that we go
[1:06:36] through and gather
[1:06:38] and garner spiritual warfare and garner
[1:06:41] things we garner things from job we
[1:06:43] garner things from abraham
[1:06:44] and as i begin to look at this fight
[1:06:47] that brother on has been on throughout
[1:06:48] this journey
[1:06:49] and you remember when he when he lost
[1:06:51] his vision and his
[1:06:52] in his peripherals there and i was there
[1:06:55] i was there when he told me he said get
[1:06:57] me to the doctor he said i'm he said
[1:06:59] he said i'm not going to work i'm not
[1:07:00] going to work today i got to get to a
[1:07:02] doctor now
[1:07:03] that right there is proof to me that
[1:07:05] brother ron ain't feeling good
[1:07:07] because brother rod is not a lazy human
[1:07:10] being
[1:07:11] but notice notice what the enemy did he
[1:07:13] came
[1:07:14] in and he shut off the vision
[1:07:17] he shut off the vision so that he
[1:07:19] couldn't see but it was a telltale sign
[1:07:21] that something was wrong and i began to
[1:07:24] think about that how that
[1:07:25] that satan didn't want just to attack
[1:07:28] his lungs but he wanted to attack his
[1:07:30] eyesight
[1:07:31] and shut off the vision and that's the
[1:07:33] same thing that that has happened in
[1:07:35] this day
[1:07:36] is that that satan has come in and tried
[1:07:39] to shut off the vision of the church
[1:07:41] so that she can't see and that she can't
[1:07:43] operate in the realm that she was
[1:07:45] destined to operate in
[1:07:47] but there is an eagle eye anointing that
[1:07:50] has come down in this day
[1:07:51] that can lift her out of this laodicean
[1:07:54] flu
[1:07:55] and take her into the heavenlies in
[1:07:57] which she was destined to
[1:07:59] actually you remember that that was the
[1:08:01] thing that that that the
[1:08:03] that they they came against and attacked
[1:08:05] brother branham against was the first
[1:08:06] thing
[1:08:07] was those visions that he was having is
[1:08:10] that they were attacking him over those
[1:08:11] things and even
[1:08:12] dr roy davis said now bro he said billy
[1:08:15] you need to leave those things alone
[1:08:17] he said it's it's demons it's demon
[1:08:19] spirits that are causing those things
[1:08:21] it ain't nothing but the devil you
[1:08:22] remember brother branham said he said i
[1:08:24] don't want to be wrong in these things i
[1:08:26] want to be right i want to be right
[1:08:28] i want to be right before god and he was
[1:08:30] there at his home placing
[1:08:32] there god came and he dealt with him and
[1:08:35] come down in a whirlwind beside his
[1:08:37] little house there
[1:08:38] and he told his wife meter said now i'm
[1:08:40] not coming back
[1:08:41] i'm going up there to that cave and i'm
[1:08:43] not coming back until i got an answer
[1:08:45] from god on these things
[1:08:46] and you remember what happened because
[1:08:48] here he was told that these visions were
[1:08:51] of the devil
[1:08:52] and then about two or three o'clock in
[1:08:54] the morning
[1:08:55] there stepped a man out of a light and
[1:08:57] told him
[1:08:58] of his peculiar birth he told him what
[1:09:00] these visions were
[1:09:02] that you were born a prophet that you
[1:09:04] were born into this
[1:09:06] age and you are born to pray for the
[1:09:08] sick
[1:09:09] and he said if you can get the people to
[1:09:11] believe you
[1:09:12] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:09:15] not
[1:09:16] even cancer you see god
[1:09:19] saw that there was going to be a people
[1:09:21] that would believe against all art
[1:09:24] and i believe that there's a people
[1:09:26] still here on earth
[1:09:27] that believe that god is ministering
[1:09:30] through angels in this day
[1:09:32] and he's ministered to a seventh angel
[1:09:34] and here we
[1:09:35] are a recipient of the message of the
[1:09:38] seventh angel
[1:09:39] that will change our mortal bodies
[1:09:43] you say well i don't understand that and
[1:09:45] i can't see it god does
[1:09:50] hallelujah you see not only
[1:09:53] does god god not only seize us but he
[1:09:56] sees through us
[1:09:59] and knows us all together the god that
[1:10:02] we serve
[1:10:03] isn't an impersonal god or a god that
[1:10:06] has lost
[1:10:06] interest in you but god is faithful
[1:10:10] when he gives a description of himself
[1:10:13] in the last church age he said these
[1:10:16] are the true sayings or he says this
[1:10:18] that this is
[1:10:19] the faithful and true witness you see
[1:10:22] god is faithful to see you through
[1:10:24] things
[1:10:25] god is faithful to take you all the way
[1:10:27] through and knowing that he is going to
[1:10:29] lead us
[1:10:30] where the grace of god is going to keep
[1:10:33] us
[1:10:34] the bible tells us in jeremiah 12 and 3
[1:10:36] but the lo
[1:10:37] though thou o lord knowest me thou hast
[1:10:40] seen me
[1:10:41] and tried my heart towards thee psalms
[1:10:44] 33 and 18
[1:10:45] behold the eye of the lord is upon them
[1:10:49] that fear him upon them that hope
[1:10:52] in his mercy psalms 34 and 15 the eyes
[1:10:56] of the lord
[1:10:57] are upon the righteous and his ears upon
[1:10:59] their cry
[1:11:00] the face of the lord is against them
[1:11:03] that do evil
[1:11:04] to cut off the remembrance of them from
[1:11:07] the earth
[1:11:08] job 36-7 says that he withdraweth
[1:11:11] not his eyes from the righteous and to
[1:11:14] think that tonight that god
[1:11:15] is not taking his eye off of you
[1:11:19] are you with me before you ever went
[1:11:21] through your trial
[1:11:23] god had his eye on you and he's not
[1:11:26] planning
[1:11:26] on turning his eye off of you
[1:11:30] hallelujah what a consolation that gives
[1:11:33] us
[1:11:34] as the children of god that we know that
[1:11:37] god has not taken his eye off of us
[1:11:39] he's not took his eye off of sister
[1:11:41] karen he's not took his eye off a
[1:11:43] brother
[1:11:43] on he's not took his eye off of our lost
[1:11:46] loved ones
[1:11:47] god is not withdrawing his eye from the
[1:11:50] righteous
[1:11:53] hallelujah you see our life is spent
[1:11:56] beneath the eye of god
[1:12:00] and every part of his dominion in all
[1:12:02] the worlds that he's formed
[1:12:03] his never closing eye is present
[1:12:08] and his creative power is felt you
[1:12:10] remember
[1:12:11] in life magazine when when the the the
[1:12:14] picture
[1:12:14] of the of the cloud was put in there i
[1:12:17] believe it was may 17 1963
[1:12:20] you notice that he he had his he had his
[1:12:22] picture put in life he didn't have his
[1:12:24] picture put in time because you can't
[1:12:27] stop life
[1:12:29] but he noticed how that how that the how
[1:12:32] brother branham would tell us about that
[1:12:35] he would look at that cloud and he would
[1:12:37] look at those things and
[1:12:38] and there he was looking at it and the
[1:12:40] angel of the lord told him said turn it
[1:12:42] to the right
[1:12:43] and if you look at that and you begin to
[1:12:46] look at it it's exactly
[1:12:47] the hoffman's head of christ and what is
[1:12:51] it
[1:12:51] when you look at that you see that
[1:12:54] christ
[1:12:54] is looking down upon the earth what is
[1:12:57] he saying to you
[1:12:58] god is looking over this last day bride
[1:13:02] to make sure you're going to make it
[1:13:04] through you have been through some
[1:13:06] battles
[1:13:07] you have been through some wars you had
[1:13:09] to come out of denominations
[1:13:11] you had to come out of every stigma
[1:13:13] every kind of complex
[1:13:14] you had to come out of every bit of
[1:13:16] formalism intellectualism
[1:13:18] all kinds of ideas that was against you
[1:13:21] but god is showing you
[1:13:23] in a magazine called life and shown it
[1:13:26] to a world
[1:13:27] that god is looking over you
[1:13:30] and to think to know tonight that
[1:13:32] almighty god
[1:13:34] the god of creation the god that is the
[1:13:37] author
[1:13:37] and the finisher of our faith his eye
[1:13:41] is upon you
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:45] you're his bride and he will get you
[1:13:48] through it
[1:13:49] and if you know that his eyes are upon
[1:13:51] you you can look at isaiah 41 and 10
[1:13:54] and say fear thou not for i am with thee
[1:13:57] be not dismayed for i am thy god i will
[1:14:00] strengthen thee
[1:14:01] yea i will help thee yea i will uphold
[1:14:04] thee with the right hand of my
[1:14:06] righteousness
[1:14:07] knowing that his eye is upon us the
[1:14:09] promise of god says in 40 isaiah 49 and
[1:14:12] 15
[1:14:13] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:14:16] that she
[1:14:16] should not have compassion on the sun of
[1:14:19] her womb
[1:14:20] yea they may forget but i will not
[1:14:24] forget thee
[1:14:25] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[1:14:27] of my hand
[1:14:28] thy walls are continually before me
[1:14:33] as paul said i am persuaded that neither
[1:14:36] death nor life nor any other creature
[1:14:39] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:14:42] love of god god
[1:14:44] has his eye on you
[1:14:47] uh when i was when i was up in ohio a
[1:14:50] few weeks ago brother ray erickson
[1:14:51] shared
[1:14:52] shared a story with me that it happened
[1:14:55] to brother wayne
[1:14:56] while he was preaching and brother wayne
[1:14:57] was was going along with a thought and
[1:14:59] he was
[1:15:00] he was going and he had some scriptures
[1:15:02] in his note and he and he thought well
[1:15:03] i'll just pass over them
[1:15:05] and when he had that thought that i'll
[1:15:07] just pass over them
[1:15:08] there came a light that came and hung
[1:15:11] over that scripture
[1:15:13] and he said well i can't pass over that
[1:15:15] well when that light came there was a
[1:15:17] woman sitting back there that seen that
[1:15:19] light come
[1:15:20] and hang over that situation and hang
[1:15:23] over that scripture
[1:15:24] and it was exactly what they needed in
[1:15:27] that moment
[1:15:28] you see god is mindful of all that
[1:15:31] you're going through
[1:15:32] you may not see the pillar of fire you
[1:15:34] may not see the angel of the lord
[1:15:36] but i want to assure you tonight that he
[1:15:39] is here he is in the building he is
[1:15:43] watching over your situation
[1:15:45] and that you may look and think well i'm
[1:15:46] the most worst
[1:15:48] sinner in the city jesus don't care what
[1:15:51] condition you're in
[1:15:52] you might show up naked and god will put
[1:15:55] clothes on you
[1:15:57] you see when he looked over there and
[1:15:59] the bible said in john chapter 5 i
[1:16:01] believe
[1:16:02] that the that the legion the man that
[1:16:04] was possessed with demons
[1:16:06] when he saw jesus here's a man that was
[1:16:10] the very first streaker that we know
[1:16:12] about
[1:16:12] come running to jesus but jesus does not
[1:16:15] leave him
[1:16:16] in that condition because his eye what's
[1:16:18] the words his children
[1:16:20] and he said that i will clothe thee and
[1:16:22] they reset in his right mind
[1:16:27] hallelujah what is it god
[1:16:30] don't care where you're at but he does
[1:16:33] care where you're going
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] notice what the bible said in psalms
[1:16:39] 121-8 the lord
[1:16:40] shall preserve thy going out and thy
[1:16:43] coming in from
[1:16:44] this time forth and forever
[1:16:48] more now
[1:16:51] the greeks say that god is all i
[1:16:56] that god is all i that he is all seeing
[1:17:00] and it's not the feeble and
[1:17:02] changing glance of fickle humanity but
[1:17:04] it is the pure
[1:17:06] and perfect eye of the eternal god
[1:17:10] that even like daniel said when he was
[1:17:12] speaking to the king
[1:17:13] over in daniel chapter 5 and 23 he said
[1:17:16] when when the king had brought in the
[1:17:18] vessels
[1:17:20] from the temple of the lord and he
[1:17:21] brought them to his own party
[1:17:23] and daniel spoke in this god and whose
[1:17:27] hand
[1:17:27] our breath is you see you see god's
[1:17:31] got you sinner
[1:17:35] or saved lost
[1:17:39] or found god sees you
[1:17:42] now i personally am not acquainted with
[1:17:44] any thieves
[1:17:45] but i have never heard of any thief
[1:17:49] doing a or committing a felony in front
[1:17:51] of a police
[1:17:53] officer or some judicial officer of of
[1:17:57] the justice
[1:17:58] i've never heard of anybody committing a
[1:17:59] felony like that
[1:18:01] knowing that they were being watched
[1:18:04] you'd have to be a dumb thief to do so
[1:18:08] i'm sure there's some people out there
[1:18:09] that don't because they want to go get a
[1:18:11] free meal
[1:18:17] but yet man can come in and break the
[1:18:20] very law of god
[1:18:22] knowing that he is the all-seeing god
[1:18:26] they can come in and they can sure they
[1:18:28] can steal away your joy they can steal
[1:18:30] away your prayer life praying for them
[1:18:32] but yet they'll break the very law of
[1:18:34] god by sin
[1:18:36] and unbelief knowing that god
[1:18:39] is the all-seeing god but i want you to
[1:18:42] know tonight that god isn't just
[1:18:43] watching you to see if you fall
[1:18:46] he's not watching you just to find your
[1:18:47] wrongdoings he's not watching you just
[1:18:50] just as hey prove that hey i'm a god of
[1:18:53] judgment
[1:18:53] but god is watching over you god is
[1:18:56] watching over you to make sure that you
[1:18:58] get out of that trap that the enemy set
[1:19:00] for you
[1:19:01] he's watching you to make sure that no
[1:19:03] harm comes to you
[1:19:04] he's watching you to make sure that you
[1:19:06] come to full maturity in the word of god
[1:19:08] he's watching you because you're hiss
[1:19:12] and i want to say to you he cares for
[1:19:14] you do you care for him
[1:19:20] i'll let that sink in just for a moment
[1:19:30] he sees when man don't see he
[1:19:33] understands what man don't understand
[1:19:36] and he's got angels that are watching
[1:19:38] over you
[1:19:41] i said little spencer boys and spencer
[1:19:43] family that was one of the songs we knew
[1:19:45] i just couldn't learn up
[1:19:46] singing he said god's got angels
[1:19:47] watching over us
[1:19:49] and you know we believe that that god
[1:19:52] has angels that are set to watch over us
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] and we know that through the message and
[1:19:57] through the bible that that minor angels
[1:19:59] they're they're watching over us and
[1:20:01] every one of us has a guardian angel
[1:20:04] and according to the scripture even
[1:20:06] jesus said he said now
[1:20:07] he said don't you hurt one of these
[1:20:09] little ones he said because their angels
[1:20:12] they their angels behold my father's
[1:20:14] face
[1:20:15] which is in heaven so we realize that
[1:20:17] everyone sitting here young or old
[1:20:20] has an angel that is watching over them
[1:20:22] and brother branham would say that
[1:20:23] that that that afflicted children or or
[1:20:26] people with needs
[1:20:27] have a special angel that's watching
[1:20:30] over them
[1:20:30] and the bible tells us in psalms 34 and
[1:20:33] 7 that the angel of the lord
[1:20:35] encampeth round about them that fear him
[1:20:38] and delivereth them
[1:20:39] now notice i want you to find this this
[1:20:42] is such an amazing thing that
[1:20:43] that the angel is not coming and the
[1:20:46] angel's not going
[1:20:47] but the angel's actually camping out at
[1:20:50] your house
[1:20:52] the angel's camping out when the enemy
[1:20:55] comes in like a
[1:20:56] like a like a lion and he's trying to
[1:20:58] destroy you there's an angel
[1:21:00] already camping out about you i want i
[1:21:02] want to say this to satan you better
[1:21:04] watch out
[1:21:05] god's got his eye on you i want to say
[1:21:08] this to satan loud and clear
[1:21:10] god has his eye on you and you better
[1:21:13] run
[1:21:14] before it's too late god will catch you
[1:21:17] god will destroy you you can torment us
[1:21:20] all you want to
[1:21:21] you can try to build us build us into a
[1:21:23] in a falsehood
[1:21:25] or you can try to tear us down but the
[1:21:27] almighty seeing god
[1:21:29] looks past our sin looks past our traps
[1:21:33] look past our mistakes the all-seeing
[1:21:36] god
[1:21:36] has got his angels and camped about us
[1:21:40] to know tonight that the angel of the
[1:21:42] lord was camping about sister denise
[1:21:45] before she fell off of a ladder
[1:21:47] before brother ron fell off a ladder and
[1:21:49] broke 44
[1:21:51] 40 vertebrae in his back god had an
[1:21:53] angel that was there
[1:21:59] he will give his angels charge over thee
[1:22:02] to keep thee in all
[1:22:06] thy ways he said my angel in exodus 23
[1:22:09] and 20. he said my angel
[1:22:11] have i sent before thee that he might
[1:22:13] bring you into a place that i have
[1:22:15] prepared
[1:22:16] and we believe that there are angels
[1:22:18] that are appearing to god's children
[1:22:22] and they are his messengers and servants
[1:22:24] of the almighty god
[1:22:25] and if you go to studying out angels and
[1:22:28] you go to studying
[1:22:29] and looking how angels move and how they
[1:22:31] operate
[1:22:32] those angels will actually influence
[1:22:35] things
[1:22:35] here on this earth god has angels
[1:22:39] and he's watching over us now the very
[1:22:42] first time that we ever see
[1:22:43] the angel of the lord in the bible it's
[1:22:46] directly after abraham receives his call
[1:22:49] from the lord
[1:22:50] but notice who the angel comes to for
[1:22:53] the very first time
[1:22:55] a woman by the name of hagar
[1:23:00] and actually if you go to studying the
[1:23:02] bible you'll find that that
[1:23:04] the angel appears to hagar twice
[1:23:07] now notice what he says and i i found
[1:23:09] this so amazing
[1:23:11] that the angel of the lord he speaks to
[1:23:14] hagar
[1:23:15] and he said he calls her by her name
[1:23:18] he he found her by a whale
[1:23:23] found her on her way back to egypt but
[1:23:25] he calls to her and he says hagar
[1:23:29] sarah's made whence cometh thou and
[1:23:32] where are you going
[1:23:34] now when i began to look at that
[1:23:36] scripture i heard an angel
[1:23:38] in this day come and tell people their
[1:23:40] name
[1:23:41] tell them their position in life tell
[1:23:43] them their address
[1:23:45] now who was doing that none other than
[1:23:47] the angel
[1:23:48] of the lord are you with me now look
[1:23:51] here's this woman and we know that that
[1:23:54] hagar is a type of the law how that she
[1:23:56] represents the stalk
[1:23:57] which is the first life but here and we
[1:24:00] find out when you go to studying out
[1:24:01] history
[1:24:02] that that you'll see that the bible says
[1:24:04] in genesis 16 that
[1:24:06] that hagar was a bondwoman that that
[1:24:09] that she was an egyptian
[1:24:10] and so we know and by history we're
[1:24:13] taught that
[1:24:14] hagar was picked up when abraham and
[1:24:16] sarah had went down to egypt
[1:24:18] and here hagar is going to produce
[1:24:21] an ishmaelite and it's all because
[1:24:24] of sarah's impatience
[1:24:28] and because she said that the lord has
[1:24:31] restrained me from barren he said go and
[1:24:34] she tells abraham and starts putting
[1:24:36] this thing on abraham
[1:24:38] you go down there you go down to you go
[1:24:40] until i say hey guard my maid
[1:24:42] that you might obtain children by her
[1:24:46] and when this seed starts taking life
[1:24:51] sarah kicks hagar out
[1:24:57] because hagar starts producing
[1:25:00] what she can't i know it's going to get
[1:25:03] a little bit sticky right here on this
[1:25:05] thought but i want you to know there's a
[1:25:06] people a lot of people that i kick you
[1:25:08] out
[1:25:10] because you're producing what they can't
[1:25:12] amen there's a lot of people who write
[1:25:14] you off in life
[1:25:15] because you're producing a holy ghost
[1:25:17] that they can't produce
[1:25:19] you see if they would ever get where the
[1:25:21] gospel really is they would actually
[1:25:23] produce
[1:25:24] what abraham seed is and if you go to
[1:25:28] looking at what hagar
[1:25:29] is hagar is a woman that is basically a
[1:25:33] slave
[1:25:34] and here she is a woman in distress a
[1:25:37] woman that is carried away by
[1:25:39] chance running through the desert she's
[1:25:42] rejected
[1:25:42] she's unwanted she's kicked out and
[1:25:45] she's going to bring forth a son
[1:25:47] that's hated by everybody and everybody
[1:25:49] he's going to hate everybody
[1:25:51] everybody's hands going to be upon him
[1:25:53] and his hand's going to be upon them
[1:25:55] here's a woman that's kicked out ain't
[1:25:57] good enough for the society that she was
[1:25:59] brought into
[1:26:00] here's a woman that was unseen by most
[1:26:03] amen
[1:26:05] wandering for the desert
[1:26:09] unseen but god saw her
[1:26:14] but god saw her and to look at these
[1:26:17] scriptures and know that god
[1:26:19] paid special attention to her and
[1:26:22] because
[1:26:23] of the angel's speech to her she
[1:26:26] acknowledges that that god is
[1:26:29] over human affairs and he is guiding it
[1:26:32] by divine government
[1:26:34] and notice what hagar does she calls
[1:26:38] god's name she grabs an attribute of who
[1:26:41] god is
[1:26:42] and she names him hell rui
[1:26:45] the god who sees me
[1:26:51] the god who sees
[1:26:54] me
[1:26:58] you can try to hide but there's no
[1:27:01] hiding place
[1:27:05] and you might be wandering through a
[1:27:07] desert
[1:27:09] but the lord is coming by the well
[1:27:13] and he's wanted to have a conversation
[1:27:15] with you you may
[1:27:17] you may feel like you have been abused
[1:27:19] you may have feel like you've been
[1:27:21] kicked out
[1:27:21] and you might be going through a period
[1:27:24] when you may feel like no one else sees
[1:27:26] you
[1:27:26] when no one else understands what you're
[1:27:28] going through no one can feel for you
[1:27:31] you might be an elderly person and you
[1:27:33] might feel unimportant
[1:27:34] or insignificant you might feel all
[1:27:37] alone because your partner in life
[1:27:38] died some years ago you might feel
[1:27:41] rejected
[1:27:42] you might feel shut up and you might
[1:27:44] feel unseen
[1:27:46] but god is saying to you i
[1:27:49] have seen you
[1:27:53] i have seen you you were unwanted
[1:27:56] by the promised one you were unwarranted
[1:28:01] by somebody that's going to bring forth
[1:28:04] the promised son
[1:28:05] but i've got my eye on you
[1:28:11] i begin to think about this i thought
[1:28:13] god
[1:28:15] i'm beginning to think about this god
[1:28:17] what i know what hagar is i understand
[1:28:20] what she represents i understand that
[1:28:21] that she represents the bondwoman that
[1:28:24] she that the bible says to cast out the
[1:28:25] bondwoman she's not
[1:28:26] part she's not a part of the free that i
[1:28:30] understand that she represents the stalk
[1:28:32] which is the first sign of life
[1:28:34] that she couldn't go on and carry the
[1:28:35] life all the way i recognize that hagar
[1:28:39] was somebody was somebody that received
[1:28:42] seed and produced an israelite
[1:28:44] and i thought my god why are you telling
[1:28:47] me this
[1:28:48] why are you having me look on this one
[1:28:50] thought it was because
[1:28:52] god wanted to produce somebody
[1:28:56] that would catch the inspiration and
[1:28:59] manifest
[1:29:00] that i am the god that sees
[1:29:03] if you'd only realize one thing that
[1:29:05] hagar
[1:29:06] is the only one that ever calls him the
[1:29:09] god that sees
[1:29:11] somebody that was unwanted somebody that
[1:29:13] was locked up in a whole lot of sin
[1:29:16] in a spot when her master had abused the
[1:29:18] situation because sarah
[1:29:20] but here god was going to prove to an
[1:29:23] unwanted little girl
[1:29:27] she was in a land that she did not know
[1:29:31] but god says i have seen you
[1:29:35] oh little bride you're in a land that
[1:29:37] you don't know nothing of
[1:29:39] but god is saying to you you will
[1:29:42] produce
[1:29:42] the promised seed
[1:29:46] i'm looking over you
[1:29:52] i see you i see you through battles of
[1:29:55] cancer
[1:29:56] i see you through battles of depression
[1:29:58] i see you through anxiety
[1:30:00] i see you when the doctor went wanting
[1:30:02] to give you a prescription
[1:30:03] to fill up your prescription i see that
[1:30:06] i see when the money
[1:30:07] is running out i see when the groceries
[1:30:10] are not
[1:30:10] in the refrigerator i see when the
[1:30:13] comforter cupboard is empty but i want
[1:30:15] you know god knows how to walk up to a
[1:30:17] house
[1:30:17] and put grocery bags on your front parts
[1:30:20] and you would realize
[1:30:21] that this is him he sees when you're
[1:30:24] full
[1:30:25] and he sees when you're empty he's a god
[1:30:30] he's a god that though you may not have
[1:30:32] the holy ghost
[1:30:33] and though you may not be in the plan of
[1:30:36] full redemption
[1:30:38] but god sees you
[1:30:44] i still believe that god saves the lost
[1:30:46] i still believe that everybody maybe
[1:30:48] everybody can't be bride
[1:30:50] but oh god let me preach that i can live
[1:30:53] such a life preach such a sermon that
[1:30:56] the lost
[1:30:57] would find their way through the cross
[1:30:59] of calvary
[1:31:04] it ain't popular
[1:31:08] it ain't popular to preach about the
[1:31:10] blood it ain't popular to
[1:31:12] teach about the cross because the cross
[1:31:14] is not something beautiful
[1:31:16] but the cross is a rugged cross air
[1:31:19] on that cross when jesus was struggling
[1:31:23] for life he was struggling to catch his
[1:31:26] own breath
[1:31:27] they had nailed his feet and they nailed
[1:31:29] his hands
[1:31:30] and when jesus would try to lift himself
[1:31:33] up off of the cross to catch a breath
[1:31:37] in his lungs he'd raise himself up
[1:31:40] and every time he'd raise himself up
[1:31:43] he'd have splinters
[1:31:44] that were piercing through his skin
[1:31:52] but his eye was on you brother jerry
[1:31:57] his eye was on you when he was climbing
[1:31:59] up calvary
[1:32:02] what is that thump thump
[1:32:05] thump that i hear it's the cross
[1:32:10] going up gal gotha's hill
[1:32:13] what's that blood trail
[1:32:17] what's that blood dripping down from
[1:32:19] that tree
[1:32:21] this is more than just some ordinary
[1:32:23] blood
[1:32:24] this is not just the man the blood of
[1:32:26] man or the blood of jew or the blood of
[1:32:28] gentile
[1:32:29] this is the blood of the almighty god
[1:32:33] god is able to look and he's able to see
[1:32:36] all things
[1:32:37] he can see you in your troubles he can
[1:32:39] see you
[1:32:40] when you fall and he sees you when you
[1:32:42] get back up
[1:32:43] he can see you through your sickness he
[1:32:45] can see you through your worry
[1:32:46] but there's only one thing that god
[1:32:48] cannot see
[1:32:49] and that's on the other side of the
[1:32:51] blood
[1:32:53] hallelujah the god that is the infinite
[1:32:56] god that knows all things
[1:32:57] holds all time space and eternity in his
[1:33:00] hands
[1:33:00] he cannot see on the other side of the
[1:33:06] blood
[1:33:14] if you be the son of god deliver us
[1:33:18] take us off of this cross
[1:33:26] where are you at where you see yourself
[1:33:29] at
[1:33:32] the father when you enter in
[1:33:36] to paradise remember me
[1:33:41] remember me
[1:33:47] this day
[1:33:50] he didn't have a chance to get baptized
[1:33:53] he didn't have a chance to
[1:33:54] to know all the teachings that jesus
[1:33:56] taught but this day
[1:33:58] this was the last man that would ever
[1:34:01] enter paradise
[1:34:03] because god was going to close it up
[1:34:05] once and for all
[1:34:07] he was the quickest one in and the
[1:34:09] quickest one out
[1:34:14] oh god would you remember me
[1:34:24] oh lord jesus you see he is omniscient
[1:34:29] he has never had a new thought about
[1:34:31] anything because
[1:34:32] all his thoughts he all has always had
[1:34:34] always will have
[1:34:36] and he knows the end from the beginning
[1:34:38] because he is god
[1:34:39] thus the thoughts of god are eternal
[1:34:42] they are real
[1:34:43] they are not simply like a man with a
[1:34:44] blueprint he has drawn up and which one
[1:34:47] day
[1:34:48] will be translated into substance and
[1:34:50] form but they
[1:34:51] are already real and eternal and a part
[1:34:55] of god
[1:34:56] don't you know that brother random said
[1:34:58] that if you ever were in his mind
[1:35:00] you'll always be there now notice
[1:35:03] in the sumerian church this is where
[1:35:04] it's coming from he said see how this
[1:35:06] works
[1:35:07] god always had his thoughts for adam
[1:35:10] adam has his thoughts
[1:35:12] what but was yet unexpressed and he goes
[1:35:15] and he grabs
[1:35:16] psalms 139 and 14 and he says i will
[1:35:19] praise thee
[1:35:20] for i am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:35:22] marvelous are thy works
[1:35:24] that my soul knoweth right well my
[1:35:26] substance was not hid from me
[1:35:28] when i was made in secret and curiously
[1:35:31] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:35:33] thine eyes did see my substance
[1:35:36] yet being unperfect i was not yet
[1:35:39] completed
[1:35:40] and in thy book all my members were
[1:35:43] written
[1:35:43] and which in continuance were fashioned
[1:35:46] when as yet there was
[1:35:48] none of them how precious also are thy
[1:35:51] thoughts unto me o god
[1:35:52] how great is the sum of them
[1:35:56] you were in his mind you were in his
[1:35:59] thoughts
[1:35:59] when you were just a little baby before
[1:36:02] you ever got
[1:36:03] your mother god thought of you this
[1:36:06] shuts down
[1:36:06] every idea that you can point at and say
[1:36:09] god is okay
[1:36:10] with abortion because he knew david's
[1:36:13] members
[1:36:14] before he was yet perfect
[1:36:21] he ain't just killing some unborn baby
[1:36:23] you're killing life
[1:36:26] those thoughts are already real
[1:36:29] [Applause]
[1:36:33] they're already real before they ever
[1:36:35] get here before the vision ever speaks
[1:36:38] it was real before jesus ever fell
[1:36:41] and bumped his little knee he was
[1:36:43] already there
[1:36:47] i think about myself right here before i
[1:36:51] was born the doctors told my mom and dad
[1:36:55] that there's going to be something
[1:36:56] mentally wrong with him
[1:36:58] i know a lot of you already think yeah
[1:37:00] but
[1:37:02] they told us tonight some going to be
[1:37:04] mentally off and they they they
[1:37:06] didn't use the word but they were saying
[1:37:07] that i was going to be slow or
[1:37:09] or in a state of retardation and they
[1:37:12] told us they
[1:37:13] told them that just to be aware of those
[1:37:14] things now what if
[1:37:16] what if what if in this day that we live
[1:37:20] in if somebody would have shut me out
[1:37:23] what if what if they would have said
[1:37:25] what if somebody what
[1:37:27] what if what if mom would have said hey
[1:37:29] you know what i'm not going to produce
[1:37:30] that i don't want to bring forth a child
[1:37:32] that's middle
[1:37:33] and i don't want to bring forth
[1:37:35] a child that's going to
[1:37:36] struggle socially and i don't have to
[1:37:39] worry about him not being able to talk
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:41] stuttering all kinds of different things
[1:37:44] what if what if you just shut down life
[1:37:48] what if but god saw me
[1:37:52] let's just say you shut it off you to
[1:37:54] shut down every young person
[1:37:55] that i preached to you to shut down
[1:37:57] every victory that we had in this church
[1:38:00] you to shut down every breakthrough you
[1:38:02] to shut down every person
[1:38:04] that i led to christ what if
[1:38:09] they may have said i was going to be
[1:38:11] something wrong with me
[1:38:13] but god said he's going to be just the
[1:38:15] way i formed him to be
[1:38:18] he's going to be wiry he's going to be
[1:38:20] uncontrollable but he's going to preach
[1:38:22] my message
[1:38:23] and when he preaches my message there's
[1:38:26] going to be somebody
[1:38:27] that's going to have a victory there's
[1:38:29] going to be somebody
[1:38:30] that realizes they can have the
[1:38:32] overcoming power
[1:38:33] of the almighty god when he preaches
[1:38:36] souls will be saved
[1:38:38] where was you job when i formed the
[1:38:41] foundation of the world
[1:38:43] where was you when the morning starts
[1:38:45] sang for joy
[1:38:46] and the sons of god shouted for joy i
[1:38:49] was in his mind
[1:38:51] and if i was on his mind i was on his
[1:38:54] mind at calvary
[1:38:55] i was on his mind in the rapture i'm on
[1:38:58] his mind
[1:39:03] you're not too insignificant your needs
[1:39:05] not too small
[1:39:06] he's a great big god but that's what
[1:39:09] makes him god to me
[1:39:10] is that it can come from the highest
[1:39:13] down to the lowest
[1:39:27] god's got long-range vision
[1:39:33] you look like you are never going to
[1:39:38] walk
[1:39:40] but he saw you walking
[1:39:43] you thought that you'd never be able to
[1:39:45] live this message
[1:39:47] you thought well i i'm not gonna have
[1:39:49] nothing to do with that
[1:39:50] but god saw differently
[1:39:55] i'll never sit there and listen to that
[1:39:56] guy preach i know what he did in his
[1:39:58] past
[1:40:00] but god come by your way and he showed
[1:40:02] you mercy
[1:40:03] he showed you how great his grace is
[1:40:07] hey let me tell you if there's anybody
[1:40:09] unworthy i've never won
[1:40:11] but i'm reminded that a prophet said
[1:40:13] that when the weakest of christians
[1:40:15] goes on their knees hell trembles you
[1:40:18] might feel unwanted
[1:40:19] you might feel cast out but that's the
[1:40:21] kind of people
[1:40:22] that god is looking for somebody that is
[1:40:25] insignificant somebody that's a nobody
[1:40:28] that he can make us somebody
[1:40:30] god is chosing the ignorant and the
[1:40:33] unlearned
[1:40:34] he didn't choose the high and mindy he
[1:40:36] didn't choose the scholars of the day
[1:40:38] but he came to us a bunch of poor
[1:40:39] peasants a bunch of fishermen
[1:40:41] didn't even know how to sign their name
[1:40:43] but they had enough gump
[1:40:45] when a man that laid there by the
[1:40:47] beautiful gate he said look upon us
[1:40:49] for silver and gold have i none but such
[1:40:51] as i have
[1:40:52] give i thee in the name of jesus christ
[1:40:55] they weren't looking on the flesh
[1:40:57] they were looking on a promise and you
[1:41:00] might be in that condition
[1:41:02] laid there for all those years but i
[1:41:04] want you to look on somebody
[1:41:05] that's bigger than your problem
[1:41:07] [Applause]
[1:41:13] hagar had some issues she had a whole
[1:41:16] thing
[1:41:16] a whole line of things stacked up
[1:41:18] against her i'm gonna produce somebody
[1:41:20] that nobody wants around
[1:41:22] but god says i see you
[1:41:26] i want you to notice the grace and the
[1:41:28] sovereignty of god
[1:41:30] the angel of the lord comes to hagar
[1:41:32] twice you flip over in genesis chapter
[1:41:34] 21 and you can go and read it later but
[1:41:37] here
[1:41:39] sarah seen that hagar was mocking
[1:41:44] it was not her time it was not her time
[1:41:47] in genesis 16.
[1:41:49] it was her time to turn back and to
[1:41:51] submit
[1:41:54] but here it come time after isaac was
[1:41:56] born
[1:41:57] and hagar was mocking
[1:42:01] and sarah said cast out the bond moment
[1:42:04] for she's not a part of the free and
[1:42:07] abraham the bible said that abraham
[1:42:09] was concerned because it was his son
[1:42:14] and you find that you go looking over in
[1:42:17] there i believe it's 14 through 19 that
[1:42:19] you find
[1:42:20] that hagar gets to a spot
[1:42:23] when the waters done ran out
[1:42:26] and the bread that she was carrying on
[1:42:28] her shoulder had done ceased
[1:42:31] and this little baby was crying and the
[1:42:34] bible said that she put him
[1:42:35] cast him underneath of a tree under a
[1:42:38] shade tree
[1:42:39] and she went off about the distance of a
[1:42:41] bow shot
[1:42:45] and the bible said
[1:42:48] hagar i have heard the crying of your
[1:42:51] child
[1:42:54] where are you he found her at a well one
[1:42:57] time
[1:42:58] and he put a well where she was this
[1:43:00] time
[1:43:03] and brother branham he goes in there and
[1:43:05] he finds it
[1:43:06] he said that god god
[1:43:10] didn't come to her god was coming to
[1:43:12] that seed
[1:43:14] he said because he was abraham's seed
[1:43:19] the angel came
[1:43:23] now i know this is just a little bit
[1:43:24] sticky for you but the reason he comes
[1:43:27] to you
[1:43:28] is because there's a power of a seed
[1:43:30] laying there
[1:43:31] you may not know what it's going to
[1:43:32] produce you might get caught up in the
[1:43:35] idea well i don't know
[1:43:37] i don't know what's going i come out of
[1:43:39] all kinds of conditions
[1:43:40] but i want you to know god ain't looking
[1:43:42] at you
[1:43:43] he's looking at that seed he ain't
[1:43:46] looking at the cancer
[1:43:48] he's looking at the seed he ain't
[1:43:50] looking at brain bleeds he's looking at
[1:43:52] the seed
[1:43:53] he's not looking at your troubles he's
[1:43:56] looking
[1:43:56] at the promise when samson would get in
[1:44:00] trouble
[1:44:01] all he had to do was know that god was
[1:44:04] looking down from heaven
[1:44:06] and he could see the promise of those
[1:44:08] seven locks
[1:44:09] hanging over top of his shoulders and
[1:44:11] the anointing of god would come over
[1:44:13] samson
[1:44:14] and he would destroy the philistines but

[1:47:14] that the society didn't want to see
[1:47:16] those people they chose not to see
[1:47:18] them but he healed the lepers when they
[1:47:20] didn't want to be around them
[1:47:22] they'd say get away from us but jesus
[1:47:24] said
[1:47:25] be thou clean you know sometimes as
[1:47:28] humanity you run into situations or you
[1:47:31] run into people
[1:47:32] that that you just you just don't you
[1:47:34] feel awkward around you try to avoid
[1:47:36] them
[1:47:37] because you don't really you don't
[1:47:38] really don't like them but you don't
[1:47:40] know how to speak to them in that
[1:47:41] situation you don't you don't know how
[1:47:43] to
[1:47:43] you you just feel awkward around them
[1:47:45] but jesus don't feel awkward around you
[1:47:49] he healed the lepers he healed the blind
[1:47:52] he delivered the demon possessed
[1:47:54] he had a conversation at a well with
[1:47:57] hagar
[1:47:57] he had a conversation at a well with a
[1:47:59] samaritan woman
[1:48:01] that was unwanted had to go in the heat
[1:48:03] of the day
[1:48:05] i don't know why i'm preaching to you
[1:48:07] like this but this was a woman
[1:48:09] that was unwanted but god chooses to see
[1:48:13] the ones that are unseen
[1:48:20] you might be the quietest person in this
[1:48:22] building
[1:48:26] you might be the person that that seems
[1:48:30] you just want to be you just want it you
[1:48:32] don't want to be in the forefront you
[1:48:33] don't want to be seen you just want to
[1:48:35] be there
[1:48:37] but god sees you god sees you
[1:48:41] you know the bible even jesus would talk
[1:48:43] about he said isn't too sparis sold for
[1:48:45] a father and he said but
[1:48:47] he said he said but how much more he
[1:48:49] said i know
[1:48:50] i have numbered the hairs on your head
[1:48:53] and he said how much more of a great
[1:48:55] value
[1:48:56] are you than the sparrows
[1:49:00] he said i know every one of them have
[1:49:02] falls to the ground
[1:49:04] i know them all he counts the stars
[1:49:07] one and all and he names them
[1:49:12] how much more valuable are you now
[1:49:14] notice
[1:49:15] notice i i'm coming to a close
[1:49:20] he said but did you ever get up in the
[1:49:22] morning and hear all those robins
[1:49:23] hotline
[1:49:25] oh you got to get up early to do that
[1:49:29] all the little birds just as soon as it
[1:49:31] breaks day we
[1:49:32] we corrals all around all night and
[1:49:34] can't get up till about one o'clock on
[1:49:35] sunday even go to church but
[1:49:37] sit around and they they stick as they
[1:49:40] stick his little heads
[1:49:41] through the air and sing and sing and
[1:49:42] sing he said he never heard of one of
[1:49:44] them
[1:49:45] ever having high blood pressure you
[1:49:48] never did see one
[1:49:49] on a crutch did you he said because god
[1:49:51] takes care of him
[1:49:52] that's right they just trust that and
[1:49:54] commit everything to god and go ahead
[1:49:57] now i i've studied nightingales and i
[1:49:59] noticed some nights when the storm
[1:50:00] clouds was coming over
[1:50:02] he'd quiet down and then all at once
[1:50:04] he'd let out loose again
[1:50:05] just sing to the top of his voice and i
[1:50:07] thought i wonder what does that
[1:50:10] now science tells us that they look upon
[1:50:12] the heavens and if they can't see
[1:50:14] any stars or any light they they get sad
[1:50:16] and they don't
[1:50:17] so they don't sing but if he can get his
[1:50:20] eye on one star
[1:50:22] he knows the sun is shining somewhere so
[1:50:24] he knows it'll break day after a while
[1:50:27] so he just sings to the top of his voice
[1:50:29] and i thought oh god that's right if i
[1:50:31] can get amongst some people
[1:50:33] who's got it and you can squish that can
[1:50:35] you can squeak out a little amen out
[1:50:38] once in a while and let me know that the
[1:50:40] power of the holy ghost still exists
[1:50:42] somewhere
[1:50:42] that's right if that little bird
[1:50:46] could get his eye upon the stars and
[1:50:49] realize
[1:50:50] that i am singing to the creator of life
[1:50:53] how much more
[1:50:55] if we are of great value how much more
[1:50:58] should we be able to echo out on amen
[1:51:00] god i know you've seen me i know you
[1:51:02] know what i'm going through
[1:51:04] i know you know what what i'm facing god
[1:51:07] i want to praise you
[1:51:09] there was a woman by that that was a
[1:51:11] widow down his airpath
[1:51:12] that elijah had had been fed by the
[1:51:15] ravens but god went down there and told
[1:51:17] him said
[1:51:17] he said you go up there there's a widow
[1:51:19] that i have commanded to feed thee
[1:51:22] i want to say to you that god sees
[1:51:24] something in you that you don't even see
[1:51:25] in yourself
[1:51:28] you see when she when he got up there
[1:51:30] she was looking at two sticks
[1:51:32] and she was looking at the bottom of a
[1:51:34] barrel and she was looking at a cruise
[1:51:35] that was empty and all
[1:51:37] but god seen something else he said he
[1:51:39] said go in there give me some water
[1:51:41] he said and fix me a cake first she said
[1:51:44] she said
[1:51:45] as i so live it i'm fixing this for me
[1:51:48] and my son and we're going to die
[1:51:52] he said but no you go in there and you
[1:51:54] fix me one first
[1:51:55] and then you fix it for your son and
[1:51:57] yourself you see god saw something that
[1:52:00] she didn't see
[1:52:01] she saw an empty barrel but god saw a
[1:52:03] barrel that would not waste
[1:52:05] and he saw a cruise that would not dry
[1:52:07] up
[1:52:10] god sees something on the inside of you
[1:52:12] you've been fighting this thing
[1:52:14] looking at this thing and you're trying
[1:52:16] to figure out what's going on but god
[1:52:18] sees something on the inside of you
[1:52:20] that you don't even see about yourself

[1:52:35] for people that'll stand out
[1:52:37] and believe him god's looking for men
[1:52:39] today that will move when the spirit
[1:52:41] moves
[1:52:42] he's looking for character he ain't
[1:52:44] looking for membership
[1:52:45] but he's looking for somebody who would
[1:52:47] take the sword of the word
[1:52:50] somebody that's not afraid
[1:52:53] and i'm gonna close on this song
[1:52:57] that don't be afraid but god be for you
[1:53:00] who can be against you
[1:53:02] he's looking for somebody that'll move
[1:53:04] when the spirit moves
[1:53:07] and if i leave you with one thought i
[1:53:10] want to leave you with this thought

[1:54:06] he didn't realize what was laying there
[1:54:10] and you may not realize what's laying
[1:54:11] there but it's laying there
