in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen amen God bless you if you will turn with me to John chapter 16 verse 7 amen John 16 and verse 7 just good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen we want to pray for the dire family we got word just before we we got here that sister Judy Dy had just passed it and so we want to remember brother Dan and his family wonderful family brother Dan has been a great friend to us and sister Judy for many years and she's in a young body right now I told brother Tim she's probably done hugged sister Karen's neck by now and so amen thank God there's a land beyond the river and it just isn't this piece of clay and so God bless you John chapter 16 and verse 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because of the prince of this world is judged Satan had to been close when he heard those words and he had to know that Jesus being who he was this means trouble of judgment because of the prince of this world is judged Hebrews 13 and8 it's familiar to all of us Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I want us to read that together again Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever I want to ask you a question do you believe it I want to ask you make sure do you believe it then it's an action word we believe it you may be seated today I just want to make mention before we get started and and uh when Brother Ray gets better we're uh sister Sue you can just pass this along to him whenever he feels better and he wants to start work here at the church he's got a quite a project that's getting ready to go on and I would just like to say this to you we're going to tear that to that back wall out and and put glass doors all the way across that but you know just like anything else if you're going to make mayonnaise it's you got to break a few eggs and if you're going to do a construction prog process it's it's going to be a little of an invas for a few days and and so uh so if you can be patient with us and and uh I'd just like to say this uh for those that would like to come and be a volunteer help to Brother Ray and maybe carry tools or carry carry whatever out to the dumpster that we're getting ready to set tomorrow uh you you just feel welcome to do it bring gloves because you got to bring gloves and then work in them we don't need entertainers we need people that's got hands and they're ready to to work and Ry don't need nobody in his way and so he knows how to do the job so he won't need none of us to tell him what to do Amen brother terus worked at my place I didn't tell him what to do one day I picked up a hammer and he walked over just as mildly and meekly as he could took the hammer out of my hand and he laid it down and he said now I'll use that yeah you you don't need to use that amen so we're familiar with all of that and so and uh we're we're going to need that to be done and so I'm looking forward to to being done and so first of all you have to have a vision and I did and then we begin to put things in place and they're coming together and and so we just thank Brother Ray and his team and everybody that's going to help with that and if you volunteer we thank you for going and I want you to understand God pays top dollar he pays absolutely top dollar you don't do anything without God blessing you and so thank you for that and whenever we tear that back wall out and we don't have a wall there to keep everything quiet if you'll just be kind of reverent when you come in and uh if you'll do that help those deacons out that'll they sure would appreciate that and just you know we just appreciate it'll all be better in a few days and so won't happen real quick because we want to do it right and so we thank thank we thank each and every one of you for that how many enjoyed last weekend on the duel I'd like to do part two today and if you remember last week I explained to you and I I gave you a real carnal example about Matt Dylan walking out and into the into the street and uh he never lost it was a movies and you know he never lost and the music would play and it would get up to a certain spot and and about in the 50th minute the gunfight would go on and but you knew he was going to win but yet it made your heart pump and made you wonder and all of those different kind of things and I reminded you you're going to go through some trials how many had some this week yeah you did yeah you did but you won in spite of all the devil tried to do to you you're still here right amen so we thank the Lord for that brother Dan daisley walked in and just before as we go and we get started here I'll never forget brother Dan's daisley he would come and Dan always had some incredible stories to tell us and he was an incredible preacher had glasses about that thick and and he could stand behind this pull pit he was my height and he was a little bit thicker than I am and and I used to be that way and so anyway he would stand here and preach and I'll never forget one night he be to tell us about a a story about a cat and a mouse and it kind of give us the illustration of Tom and Jerry this great big vicious cat and this cat was after this little bitty helpless seibly Mouse and he chased him all over the house and that Mouse knew that his hot breath coming down on him and his vicious claws if they ever got a a halt of him it was instant death and he chased him across the couch and he chased him under the cabinets and he chased him through the living room and he chased him all over the place and and finally he got up on a bookshelf where there was a bottle of wine that was open and he ran up that bottle of wine and he went down in it and he went finally got to the bottom and he pushed and he he came back up and he worked his way out of the top of that bottle of wine and he'd got into enough wine while down there he said where is that cat so I pray today that you can fall into a bottle of wine of the Holy Ghost are you getting me and you may GLE for a little while and you may think I'm going to drown but just wait climb out the top devil you picked on me all week long where is that devil at the scripture tells us and I'll just paraphrase for you Paul we know the devil just told the this man that was standing there and he was trying to cast The Devil out and he says Paul we know and Jesus we know but you we don't know I wonder if he knows who we are I wonder if we've got enough of the power of the Holy Ghost living on the inside of us that we are a proper representative of Jesus Jesus Christ and he's literally terrified when we wake up in the morning and we begin to shake the kingdom of hell when we pray that's the most powerful thing that we do is pray and read our Bibles and arm oursel for the day don't never neglect don't never neglect to not do that notice the scriptures in Revelations chapter 9 12 and verse 9 he said and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and and and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down which accused them before God day and night notice these next words and they over came him I'm a part of that they and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen give me just a moment my eyes are not working well for me Hebrews CH 12 and verse 1 wherefore see and we are also compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses Homer Wayne your moms and dads that have passed on they're watching now now it's your turn to run the race let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us now notice what our Focus has got to be looking unto Jesus looking under Jesus you'll get disappointed if you look into and anybody else the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy what set before him endured the cross and despising the shame and is sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God brother brandom called the enemy on the scene and he preaches a series actually I think it's five different times on on the trial and brother brandham was they might have thought it all it's just another sermon but it really wasn't brother brandom just didn't pick a text just to be picking a text but he was actually bringing the enemy to a standoff may we call it a duel somebody's going to die in a duel somebody's going to die in a duel I'm sorry somebody gets shot somebody wasn't quick enough or somebody wasn't accurate enough brother BR said I'm going to have a a court trial and the case is the word of God promised versus the world what a statement the word of God promised versus the world now we're going to set it like a court trial for just a little bit before you come to this prayer line he said the word of God versus the world now that's the case the cause for this and indictment is a breach of promise that of God's promises they claim that God hasn't kept his promise the prosecutor Attorney in this case is Satan and and he is the world's witness because he is of the world the defendant of this case is almighty God the defense witness of the case is the Holy Ghost ghost and we're going to call them to a trial just for a few moments and he lays it out the prosecuting witness that he is bringing to defend this case is Mr unbelief Mr skeptic have you ever dealt with any of these guys and Mr impatient I'm going to ask you again have you ever met with Mr unbelief Mr skeptic also can be called Mr critic and Mr impatient now we're going to give them a trial the court is called to order the prosecutor calls his witness Mr unbelief and he takes his stand first now I'm going to let you go and listen to those sermons that you'll get it better but I'd like to just kind of bring it and bring some events to to be a reminder to today of whose side that we're on I'd like to remind the devil today if you're want to have a duel with the bride of Jesus Christ around the world I want to remind you that it wasn't too many years ago in the time of Eternity it wasn't too many years ago Satan you watched brother brandham go to a cave and you watched brother random in that cave he was praying about some things and you watched an angel walk in the entrance of that cave and as he walks in the entrance of that cave he begins to tell our Prophet now fear not I'm sent from the presence of the Lord and he begins to tell him of his commission how that he would go around the world world and he would begin to as he would tell him in a paraphrasing he would pray for kings and potentates and he would he would pray for great and have great meetings around the world even brother brandham would begin to tell him like Moses you know all of his excuses like you do but I want to ask you Satan did that not come to pass did not that angel stand at the pull pit with him at every service and they would ask brother brandom do you get nervous no no the Angel's standing with me and he told me to do this I want to ask you little bride no matter where you're at around the world we shouldn't be nervous we shouldn't be tore all to pieces we shouldn't let Mr skeptic and Mr unbelief come so against us and tell we falter and fail he's with us that's greater than a mighty preacher that's much greater than a mighty General our Lord Jesus Christ The Mighty Angel we're under his influence I'm glad to be standing where we are today could I just take you to another place very quickly it's in Houston it's in Houston there's a large crowd crow that is there estimates are it's in the thousands and and there's a doct best who's been a skeptic that don't believe in Divine Healing and he wants to be the representative of the church that will stop this movement stop this fanatical movement and and put a heart to it why he's he's a man that's great learned and he's quite a speaker well he's even he's so confident he's he's hired he's hired photographers to stand on the scene and he knows he's got people that's there behind him and and and so you know brother brandham is to be the man that he's going to Crossfire but he doesn't realize that brother branham's got a representative and Dr Bosworth says brother brandom I'll take this there's no need in you getting into an argument or all of that I I'll take this for you you know he was an old steady man yeah he was a steady man he was a real friend to brother brownon when a lot of preachers had walked away he was a real friend to brother brandham and he said now don't be arguing oh I won't argue I I won't argue at all I won't fuss with him at all and you know Dr best makes his case and and you know he does a fine job of making his case but Dr Bosworth he just hinges the entire debate on one question question I want to think about that Satan just one question you couldn't do nothing with it you couldn't do anything with one question you're smart you're intelligent you you've known you've got a great case load that you have had all the way down from the fall and even in heaven you created a war but you stumbled in I want to remind you you stumbled you stumbled in Houston and you couldn't answer one question what does the compound names of Jehovah have to do with Jesus Christ well he knew if he answered that question Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Nissa if he answered that question he's tangled up in his own fight and then he begins to make accusations but he doesn't realize brother brandham is up in a place and he had promised I'm going to stay up there out of the freay but there's an angel you challenge a duel and you challenge a fight God IMM it Goliath challenged God made it are you with me put him put men in a lion's den God will go there put them in a furnace of fire God will go there put them against a r sea god'll go there put a ride just before the coming of the Lord god'll go there when the enemy says it ain't going to happen look how far you've been and look how dark it is look at a world falling apart it's supposed to got to go [Applause] there he steps down out of the audience as he walks down and he comes down and comes through the people walks to the stage well that's greater than any president ever made a walk he steps to the pulpit and brother Brandon was very courteous to Dr best he wasn't in no fighting Mode God don't have to fight he was very courteous and he actually was thankful to him he was thankful he was very nice to him and then he begin to ask the audience how many of you been healed in the meeting this week and thousands of people raised their hands stood to their feet there's the answer it's more than just preaching a sermon but there's the answer there's the answer he heard a whirl start coming through the building whirl come down he' heard that whirl before you see brother Brandon wasn't standing standing alone isn't that right Satan and neither are we standing alone isn't that right we're not standing here by our own accord isin't that right and that whirl came down across the place and as it comes and they're taking pictures listen a greater than William brandham was standing there you say well brother Ron you guys call his name too much oh I don't think we'd ever do that are you with me now he was God's representative to the Earth and and they catch a they catch a a Mystic light a supernatural light now the important one in the picture is that light but that light was not ashamed of the man I don't care where the critics are I don't care where the critics are that light was wasn't ashamed of that man could I take you to Bombay India and brother brandom is standing there and all of those witch doctors are are power against him you know he you know sometimes in a duel you have to come to a spot it's like a it's like a showdown you you go along for so while and and it's like a showdown all of a sudden all of the sudden something's something's beginning to happen and and here a blind man comes before him and and brother Brand's had a vision and operating by Vision he had confidence he wasn't just doing it on his own brother jimy was standing there knowing in the next few minutes what what he had saw in VIs Vision was going to take place in reality it had happened with a boy in Finland that was dead and he'd saw the vision two years ago and told them to write it down on the fly leaf of the Bible and listen when he kneeled down beside of him he said you can call me a false prophet if he's not off of the ground in a few moments oh today they want to fight it but they wern't fighting it there are you with me now and so and so there he is standing with this blind man now he could have just prayed he could have just prayed for him and it would have been well but he turns to the to those witch doctors those Idol worshippers and he says which of your gods right which of your Gods can come heal this man I'd like to say gods of the world which of your Gods can turn our bodies young again can bring our dead loved ones from the grave we got a message that we'll do it but which of your Gods can do that which of your Gods can take girls like that's sitting here tonight and make them uh like real pillars of fire young men that have been tainted by life and turn their life and make them pillars I'll tell you this God that's living amongst us he accepts a challenge why of course nobody stepped forth they knew their God couldn't do that such a thing and he turns and begins to pray for the man and in a few moments that man begins to worship God I'd like to take you to Mexico where there's a woman that's been in the in the meeting before and that morning her baby dies and she goes to the doctors and the doctor said go bury your baby it's dead but she had seen a living God she heard more than a church service but she saw a living God and in witnessing that Living God she didn't want to bury her dead baby there was something inside of her if I can get to Jesus it may be a lot of trouble but if I can get to Jesus I won't have to bury my child it had rained all day long and she had wrapped that life less baby waited till service hundreds of ushers couldn't keep her away and finally she gets to brother brandom and and she's making such a noise and brother Billy Paul says that you know she's came through all these hundreds of ushers and she won't turn back the baby's dead and he finally turns into a brother and he says won't you go pray she don't know who I am won't you go pray and he begins to make steps to go a vision breaks just a moment bring the baby he knew I'd like to say to death this morning death you couldn't hold that baby the same as you couldn't hold Jesus the same as you couldn't hold Doug we've seen a showdown in this church Hallelujah brother brandom took that little life less baby in his arms and began to pray and he said as I prayed I felt warmth coming that blanket life came back to that baby where's your D at there Satan you had our savior's body for for three days but in all your power you couldn't corrupt our Lord Jesus Christ you had him in hell you had keys you had arrows but he came to your house and when he came to your house he took your keys he defeated hell death and the grave and in spite of all your power on Resurrection morning Jesus Christ came up out of that grave now I want to remind you today that we was inside of him and you couldn't corrupt him then and if we was inside of him you couldn't corrupt us then and neither can you corrupt us now give the Lord a good hand right there we have a cloud hanging in the back of the building as you go out of the building it's illuminated there I want to remind the enemy he knows why that Cloud's there the Skeptics can say what they want to but Satan himself knows he knows there had been a lot of people go to the desert and want to find find something greater out of the book maybe to be un able to untangle the codes of the Bible but God sent the prophet there on a commission and he would be hunting Havalina Hawks and seven angels came down and revealed the the Seven Seals that would be revealed that would unlock the Mysteries and would also expose Satan himself self all the way down from the beginning of time you see the church world had on a white horse Christ riding and many of the Great teachers of the day had Christ riding on a white horse but listen when the seals were released and a cloud was formed our Prophet came back to Jeffersonville and begin to release the Seven Seals God had revealed in Simplicity the breach between the church ages and the and the the seals and I want you to understand that that releases the Bride of Jesus Christ our names was in the book even John rejoices when he sees his name in the book Satan the reason you hate the Book of Revelations is is because it exposes your works and we would have been just another formal lifeless group of people right but the very life of Jesus Christ is in the Bride of Jesus Christ doing the works of Jesus Christ and we recognize that that enemy was riding in Paul's day the mystery of iniquity was already working in his day it is rode all the way down to this age as a pale horse rider but God always meets The Challenge whether it's a liing anointing a man anointing or an ox anointing or an eagle anointing we're anointed in a prophetic work God meets The Challenge it wasn't just to brother brandom but it's to you hallu are you catching it just for a moment you see this is more than just about brother brandom it's more than about brother Frasier it's more than about me more than about Andrew more than about our favorite preachers around the world it's about [Music] him it's about him now you would be disappointed you drove two or three hours to this service and and you didn't didn't feel that that presence I don't care how many services I've been in since a boy that presence is always there now maybe you come in an attitude to where that you're not going to get you're not going to get nothing out of service maybe because you didn't prepare but if you properly prepare for the service and you take your position in church now there's two opposing Spirits even in church and one will try to get you critical and one will look at the watch and one one will do this and the songs wasn't right and this wasn't right my favorite singer didn't sing and he'll try to get you to think about your tractor at home or you know your grass has got to be mow or it's really cold outside I wonder if my car will start after a while don't you worry but if you can break through that Humanity if you you can break through that Humanity I don't care what the problem that you fought all week long if you can break through that and say God I've came to this spot come and meet me at my Pew come and meet me right here on brother brother sharik I heard him many years ago and I'm going to tell the story the best that I can remember brother charik from South Africa he's always had tent Ministry throughout throughout his life as a minister he said his mother and father would go to brother branham's meetings in South Africa and and they didn't know if he was a true Prophet or he wasn't a true Prophet they they just were sitting there and had a lot of questions in their mind but sister sharik which was his mother was sitting there there was a woman in a red dress sitting right beside of her and she seemed to be a little bitty woman and as the meeting would go on and it would come to the prayer line as brother brandom would many times do he would pray for the patient and then he would said now you know I'm waiting on something and then he would watch over the audience and see the pillar of fire moving and he would begin to call out people this one and that one come to their situations God's an ontime God wherever you're at and so he comes and and literally they're a long way back in the meeting and and he says no doubt your father's heard this many times sister Debby and so and so he was sitting there and it was a lady in a red dress and he said may God heal you of that bone disease and then he moves to the next patient and sister sharik listened to Bones cracking she used the term popping popping back into place popping back into place popping back into place and when that woman got undone popping she was over six foot tall Satan was you there yeah was you there did did that happen or didn't it happen are you with me well same meeting brother Brandon must being in a chauffeur a man chaffering him to church and he chauffers him you know every night he always chaffering him and never has a never has a question never he's being very sweet as he can to brother brandom and brother brandham asked him he said is there anything I can do for you he said 'well brother brandham is I've tried to get a prayer card but I haven't been able to get a prayer card my friend has a son that's crippled and he says well where's he at and he said well he couldn't get a prayer card so he didn't bring him he said he's just just off the way here he's he's in he's in a upstairs place in an upstairs house in an upstairs apartment if I can say that and he said well well take me by he said he took him up and as he took him up the old Rasmus tells his story and he said we were talking about him this morning reason we were talking about him because I had it in my notes and so and so we were talking and he said he said they walked up and he said the the chauffeur LED brother brandom up the steps to the room and he walks in now he's got to go preach a meeting and he scheduled to preach a meeting he he walks into the apartment isn't it nice when God comes to your house a't it nice I'm not calling brother Braham God but who he represented was God and you've got a boy and that boy can't walk Randy I love this brother brandham didn't even pray for him I feel the power of God here brother brandom reaches down on the floor and picks up a baseball you enjoy playing baseball you guys enjoy playing baseball and he picks up a baseball and he says is this your this your ball yes and he throws it out the window he said go get it that little boy jumped out of that bedl Hallelujah brother BR hope you can feel some of what I feel say I have a gun and it'll shoot and it's a good true shooting gun and I hang it up on the wall and say yes oh sure I got a gun well what do you do with it it hangs on the wall That's Faith people say oh I'm a Christian I believe God can but what do you do about it put it to work turn it loose something do something with it get out of get out of H that's devil where he says you're still hurting you're a liar pull a bead on him get him in the scope don't be afraid to pull the trigger cause it'll go off just as sure as anything yes sir it'll Boomerang on him so hold on I got this from brother Tim this morning he said we need to think of how big our God is who called us to the journey the enemy will whisper words of doubt and despair to Rob us of all the promised word of God that has made God is B not bound God is not bound by time nor is he Limited in his resources it all depends on our faith for us to doubt weaknesses and our faith and shifts our Focus From God to our circumstances folks I want to I want to drive to something in just a moment we have the indisputable facts that we have an empty tomb and we're fighting a defeated enemy and we are the proof we're disputing with a defeated enemy we have the testimony all the enemy wants to criticize your testimony but he criticized Mary who had met an angel and she said be it unto me according to Thy Word she knew in the scriptures there was a promise of a virgin will conceive and she found herself in the word oh if we can find oursel in the word this morning if we could just say and it comes to our experience don't let the devil doubt your experience don't let the devil doubt your experience and put it in your mind questions you know you was there I want to say it and I want to drive this home and I want I I'm preaching more than just just a sermon to you this is an action sermon cuz you meet him on Monday and you meet him in this you even meet him in church and he begins to whisper in your mind cuz he has a right to but you have a right to pull the gun you have a right to pull the [Applause] sword this is more than just sitting in a Pew experience here you are the defeaters you are the serpent bruisers that God has called as an invincible Army as Believers and you take your position Satan ought to be scared to death of you that's last week you were called out because she had an experience in my office ain't that right just raise your hand so she had an experience in the office sister Connie hadn't told me and then on Monday Sunday evening you I wanted to hear it for myself I'd watched it I had watched it while I preach and I spoke to you about it I saw your reaction and I thought all evening if I can catch her in a quiet moment I'm going to ask her what was it like and you were cleaning because it I got a lot of trophies in in my room but the greatest trophies I've got deer I've got an elk I got a fish I got bear I got a lot of nice things that God's done for me I've got reminton statues the boys argue if something happens to me who gets the remnant in statues and who gets the remed in guns I've got a nice office God's blessed me with but the Angels met me in that office and I Knew by your experience that you met him ain't that right I was sitting your bar and you leaned across that bar and you begin to tell me of all of my trophies in the office I've got a corner full of toys and those toys are nice but I really love it when those toys come to life when yeah Zoe Zoe's looking at me now and Zoe has a nursing and a doctor station and and Zoe is cooking and Zoe's twirling and she's twirling and the music's going and she's Aurora orur she's help me here her last favorite she danced to it yesterday Rapunzel Ariel she was

building now won you just let him come to you just now why the door brother Ron why the duel I'm going to be very open and honest with you and I don't care what what the enemy says four weeks ago I

I'm standing I'm not telling you go cry for me I'm not telling you to go whimper in a box somewhere or another I'm telling you we're going to win look at that cloud we're going to win the same one

doctor supports listen either this word is true or it's not true you're going to have a wedding I'm going to do it for you that's what I [Applause] believe I have no choice brother random says and it is a rising of the sun he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm sorry I'm going to I'm going to go over my time is that okay we are his beneficiaries and are to prove his life is in us now so let me just say as I stand before you I am a witness and you sit in your Pew you're a witness are you with me now Ray your wife you're a whole lot different than you was only a couple years ago different who made the difference he made the difference when people didn't give you a chance you'll never turn around he makes the difference when people didn't believe in you he makes the difference what is the difference he he is the difference people didn't believe in you Gabriel he is the difference he's the life that there has never been a life lived like he was a Son of God and he died and shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on Easter morning we as his servants are commission by him to go into all the world and to bring the good news to every person that he is a living and how can we do that by the word only for the it is written the gospel came not by power only but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove to prove Andrew that he is alive I don't care what the devil says he is alive so I want to say this and just bring it to a pinpoint we are here and we have arrived we are the Overcomers of Le osia you may not have cancer but you fight different things in your life and you will always fight until the Rapture but we are Overcomers somebody say that today I rais the banner I raise our flag and say we're standing in Lea we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we will overcome he fornew us he predestinated us he elected us he anointed us not to lose not to lose say it with me we have not come here to lose we have not not come here to

bunch of panty wasters I'm sorry we are warriors that are called to the battle we recognize Satan at his trcks if he wants a fight fight if he wants a fight Bring it on Bring it bring it I don't have any confidence in my flesh but I have confidence in this right here I have confidence in the seed that he planted on the inside of me before the foundational world I got confidence in that deity that he placed on the inside of me confidence courage we are [Applause] warriors brother Chester I or Samuel I don't know if you're used to preaching like this but we win we win brother BR says in God of this evil age he said has God lost control or is he permitting another agency to control the two answer to this question to my opinion there's two opposing spirits in the world today at work now there can't be more than two there's only two heads one of them is the holy spirit at work and the other one is the spirit of the devil and in these last days in deception he said I base my thoughts right here on the that I will use for the rest of this text the rest of our message to Spirits one of them is God's Holy Spirit and the other one is the devil Spirit working in deception notice these next sentence the people of the Earth are now making their choice now the people of the work now Putin made some incredible statements last week of how he was going to attack us last week this week since we preached here last Sunday he made some attacks statements at how I'm going to attack the west and then he sent up nuclear warheads into this space to travel around the Earth and when he needs it he sends it where it needs to go now he can't do that without permission from God God raises up men men to fulfill his word I don't mean to scare you but Putin can't do anything without God letting him do it are you with me are you with me the pope can't do anything unless God lets him do it Israel is fighting for their boundaries I don't care what critics of uh the critics of Israel is doing I don't care the sympathizers of Palestine I don't care the sympathizer of Hamas I don't care the sympathizers of all of all the people around that I know we don't like War but we are at War you might not have a machine gun in front of you but there's a devil trying to kill steal and destroy he is nobody to negotiate with I refuse to give him our children I refuse to give him my marriage I refuse to let him defeat you need to go at War and get your joy back and your courage back and your strength back it whatever he took away from you go after it in the name of Jesus [Applause] Christ we don't have time for pity parties we don't have time to pet the devil on the back and say oh what a bad devil he is a you know to go somewhere else let me just say he has came to our property it is the time to defeat him I'm not talking about 309 Pine Creek Lane I'm talking about this right here he has came to attack fight him back brother ronom I'm too weak what was Georgia Carter too weak nine years and so many months and she gets a book on the Promises of God and she begins to pray he's my God and God sends his Prophet to her house come on church God orchestrates everything brother Ron I've lost a Revival in my life pray God sends a Revival to your home amen and then when God starts coming to your home there's nothing the devil can do to stop it brother brother Ron we're so discouraged we're so we're so tore all the pieces we're we're just so everything's going wrong in my life I'm I'm just getting line with the word and whatever the word said you get with that word line your life up get the trash get whatever out of your life get the thought out of your life get the opinions and get your attitude in control of the Holy Ghost make this vessel a place to where God can live on the inside of it not be ashamed of you brother on you don't know what the devil has done to me in my life are you kidding I was at a place preaching convention one of the associate ministers walks in and I'd just been burned a couple years before that one of the associate members walks in and and he talks for about five minutes and he burned his hand on a stove it's about the spot of the size of my thumbnail and he was showing everybody how bad he was burnt and when he turned around and looked at me it hit him it hit him and he said sorry I took up your time I'm going to finish now I was paralyzed and I walk my lungs were burnt and I was supposed to die and I lived and in a few days I'm going to stand here and Tell You Folks I'm going to live sister Kimberly Satan is always close when God's dealing with you and you can have a prayer meeting that will shake the shingles off of the roof and then when that Spirit just kind of dissipates a little bit who comes the enemy and he'll start point point point point sister Conor you do you fight the same enemy and all of a sudden he's a the devil didn't bring you back to church and the devil tells you God ain't never done nothing for you let me just tell you it was God that told you you got to get there it was God that caused you to call Sister Connie and said I got to get there and brother Aaron is praying praying across this prayer
