words that god says i will do all that you ask of me you're a virtuous woman you are my bride hallelujah we could we could close tonight and say we've had church amen amen you can be seated just a moment certainly good to see you in the house of the lord today and amen amen so i will be speaking for you this weekend and i hope that's all right amen i i we have brother benton coming with us next saturday night and he has two brothers from europe that are going to come and we will hear from them next saturday evening and brother andrew is going to speak on sunday morning so so we and then we'll maybe give him the next week and then we got brother jason jackson right after that and so amen we're looking forward to those those times in the lord as well and so amen i i consider brother jason thunder and lightning so amen i i'm a i'm kind of a fan of his and so we're looking forward to having him amen certainly appreciate your prayers for sister connie she had her sinus surgery for those that didn't know she had sinus surgery on thursday and they went in and re-broke the nose and opened up everything up in there and uh it's quite a bit of pain that goes with that quite a bit of drainage and and she's laying pretty low for the first time in her life and she don't know what to do with herself so amen so if you would remember her sister whitney's with her tonight we'll be with her in the morning and we'll try to get her back in service next weekend and she said i'm going to go if i have to sit in the office i said nope you're standing right here you stay right there in that chair she didn't put up no fight so i felt like it was all right and uh i just kept telling her she was beautiful it would be okay we'll get through this thing and so hey man she's got a lot of brother homer in her she's tough she wants to be going she wants to be moving and this is flat put her in the recliner so so it must be pretty pretty pretty rough so we want to remember that and thank the doctors that were able to do it and to take care of that we have much to pray for with brother harold for those that that know he had open heart surgery this week and then and then that he had dallas a dialysis issue and uh that turned him south and then they took him his numbers were going out of bounds brother nathanael could give us a lot more details but basically they revived him at the ct scan did a opened his chest back up and and so he's in a he's in a tough spot couldn't be in a better stop spot with jesus though and that's that's that's the main thing that we look at that we're we're we're when it's a little bit out of the doctor's hands it's right in the hands of our lord jesus and so pray for sister denise and the family there uh they're there they got to go in and see him today uh for just a few moments i believe and they and so if you remember them in a special way the next 24 hours is very critical and uh and so if you remember that i think they've given the report this afternoon and i don't know these numbers brother nathaniel but about 15 of his heart is working and so so if you remember that in prayer that god would do a work we've seen what god can do just to give you a bit of encouragement and maybe sister denise is watching even now brother ralph walls about 12 of his heart was working so and he's lived for several years and so we just are asking the lord to just come and do a work amen i would like for you to remember a family a friend of mine passed away this week his name was jack trump he was a business mentor when i was a young man passed away he was 84 years old he did a lot of phenomenal things to them to the community and uh was quite a man he was quite an incredible fella i he he actually he was kind of like a second daddy to me through the years he was a kind of a fellow that would that would keep up with you and and uh he felt like i was his son and so every month he would call to see how he was doing and so brother boyce took me to the wake on thursday thursday night and and we were there that kind of took me back a few decades to to a time before marriage and uh some good some bad but when i received the lord jesus christ it made such an impact on jack until he made a move towards the lord and so and so we we had many discussions on that and um he never saw this but he became a christian and so i want to remember his family i know i know them well and so i you know but i as i came home and i was thinking about it as i came home i'm a different man now and that man is not the man that i know he was a young guy many of you saw that fella he was red-headed he was younger had a lot of energy he was a lot skinnier but he was a different man and i would rather live with the man that lives on the inside of me now do you understand that the quality of life is extremely different amen to know jesus means more than the world amen on a good note i'm not going to say where but brother caleb from was released from prison and he is the last pastor out of that out of that nation that is released and he is free and he's now back as being a pastor of that church and so and and so we're i'm thrilled i i may show you a picture in the morning and and uh and so we're certainly thrilled for caleb that he's home with his family with his church and he's a lot skinnier now but he's a wonderful young man and i want you to i want to remind you this he believes this message just like you do but he lives in a nation that'll put him in prison for it and there's a congregation that goes to church every sunday with the risk of being in prison tomorrow and so and so when you think about this message some are paying an incredible cost and i sent the picture to our family and i said here is a book of acts man that just stepped out of prison for preaching the same message that i preach and he believes it with all of his heart arrested for carrying bibles and and getting bibles into the hands of believers and so and so i i think it was about five of the ministers there that were doing it and they would send letters home to their wives don't give up you press on don't miss a day some of their letters were like reading the book of acts and and so god bless brother caleb in a special way and i just pray that his protection hand would be upon him in the coming days and coming weeks as they go back to work in the kingdom of god and so amen and so we believe that with all your hearts i got up this morning and as a the sermon that we're getting ready to preach this was my devotion that i read this morning one of them proverbs chapter 10 and verse 12 hatred stirreth up strifes but love coverth all sins the writer writes it let's face it we all enjoy a juicy bit of gossip now and then as wrong as that scenes most of us are guilty for stirring the pot at one time or another it's not the worst thing that we can do right but god's word tells us that gossip is more indicative of hatred than love words can do more damage than any amount of physical harm gossip hurts it tears down it wounds our spirits i want you to notice that statement it wounds our spirits it causes deep pain which can take years to heal and sometimes its wounds never heal this side of eternity love always protects it always heals it always builds up sometimes it's necessary to reveal hurtful information but more often we can just let those these go and protect those around us from hurtful comments we can keep our mouths shut quit stirring the pot let conflicts die before they begin or at least we can choose not to contribute to the conflict [Music] hatred fans the flames of controversy dissension without concern for who is hurt love on the other hand covers over wrongs when love is exercised conflict can be smothered before the damage gets out of control i thought that was pretty powerful let's stand and have church amen ruth chapter 3 and verse 1 and we're going to look at staying in the field and this is going to be the field of forgiveness hallelujah let's talk to the master just before we we read the book just now heavenly father we bow our heads before you now we sent your holy spirit near us in a very special way in a sweet kind of way lord our hearts are heavy because of brother harold and lord we're asking you even now that you would send your word and heal him guide the doctors guide all the attendants that are taken care of i pray that you would anoint them to go beyond even their capabilities father all it we're all in your hands and we ask you now that you would come on the scene for brother harold we pray that you would stretch forth your hand to mercy lord we none of us know our time or season to go i ask you that you would come and bring us all strength and may we get nourishment from your word just now heal our hearts strengthen us just now anoint the words of the speaker we can study we can lay aside time try to find the right atmosphere to speak the word from lord now we ask you that you take the uppermost seat of this house feed us as the great shepherd yourself minister to us in a mighty way and whomever will hear these words tonight lord let it go to the very pivotal place that it needs to go we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen and amen and amen then naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not boaz our kindred with whose maidens thou west behold the winner with barley tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be that when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shall go in and uncover his feet and lay down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do and she went down to the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law made her and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was married he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning insomuch as thou followest not young men whether poor or rich and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman you may be seated tonight you know these quotes well brother branham said this in the kinsman redeemer he said they journeyed on ruth and in her heart not knowing where she was going but a type of the church we sojourn like abraham pilgrims in a strange land amongst the strange people and she went and finally she came into the room and the place where naomi was bringing her and she and what did she find everybody patting her on the back and saying ruth we're glad to have you down here she found discord she found something evil she found trouble and the preachers that'll tell you that the christian life is a flower in bed of ease he either is deceiving you or he's never accepted that experience for himself the world hates you and people will hate you and you've got to take the way with the lord's despised view quite a statement in it and being laughed at and made fun of and ever anything else you got to be different you're born of another nation he said now then notice life was hard for her and it's hard after you become a christian because you got to adjust yourself from one life of deity and pleasures of the world to another life of consecration to god personally it's a better life i want to say that to you it's a better life you've got to readjust yourself over into this side and ruth had to adjust herself from being in that land where there was plenty to eat everything was respected to a people that was laughing and making fun of her into a land she gleaned in a field and and what she eat and put it and put it in her scarf and take it home and beat it out and make some bread and her and her mother-in-law eat it young people you go to school and sometimes you're the only one in your school maybe you're as an adult you work in a in a factor where you're the only one in your factory maybe you're the only one in your family and you can feel the rejection you can feel what people are thinking you can feel what people are saying they don't have to say it you can just kind of feel it but let me just say as a christian we raise our head above that [Music] we can either bring ourself and allow ourselves to just flow any away and become a hypocrite or we can conserve create our life to god are you with me now consecrating our life to god and know that this world is not a home we're just a passing through it doesn't matter what our neighbors do us it doesn't matter what a community does it doesn't matter what our government does [Music] are you with me now sure she had a history you did sure she had a past you did she had a first husband so did you your first husband was your nature you were born in sin you're not ruth tonight but you're a type of her you needed a kinsman redeemer he was willing to provide and protect for you and our kinsmen redeemer jesus christ was willing to take on our shame he became sin that we might become his righteousness when we become a christian we realize the blood of jesus christ watches us and the scripture said there is therefore now no condemnation for those of you that had a very stained past this was a powerful scripture for me romans chapter 8 verse 1. sure we had a past but when god looks at your past through the blood of jesus christ he sees it as though you never did it in the first place it is gone in his mind it is only in your channel of your memory to where the accuser of your brethren constantly accuses you but you remind him that the blood of jesus christ washed away that sin she had to be determined that her past was not going to determine her future she had to be determined that her past would not determine her future how many of you as as parents now look back at the no i'm just going to say how how you think it look back at the failures of your parents and you're determined not to do that are you with me now you're determined and through the the conversion of the blood of jesus christ you can break every chain you can't do it by vows and making broken promises but you can buy a new birth become a real father and a real mother and you can look past your own weaknesses and move into his promises you can imagine the deep scars that ruth had a widow being born of lot's descendants the deep valors the horrible chapters of her books of her life the mind battles that she had to go through him talking to you too the limited thoughts of access of what god could do in her life but god had plans for her she was not just working in a field she was the field she was not just working in a field she was the field that god was going to work on [Applause] now listen you might think that you're the only one that's suffering persecution and right now maybe nobody in this building but somebody listening susanna wesley two houses in her life burned down she lost almost everything twice had 19 children nine would die as infants accidentally smothered one while she was nursing that did not stop her her son was one of the most powerful preachers that ever lived and she wrote most of his sermons with him are you with me now what a powerful woman that she was you see she would not allow the circumstances of life that it so bound her to determine what god was going to do in her life fanny crosby another born blind refused to sell her gift of popularity of music lived in total property wrote songs they wanted her to write the national anthem they wanted to write a lot of different songs for for the music world but one song that she did right i shall know him i shall know him i shall know him by the nail prince in his hands pass me night o gentle savior hear my humble cry thousands and tens of thousands maybe into the millions would walk to the altar with that song lyrics that was inspiration that came to a woman you say brother on women can't do anything you've got your eyes crossed up and your t's are messed up women are the most powerful in the scriptures god writes through esther he writes through ruth he writes to rahab he raises women from the depth of the earth and raises him to be queens [Applause] you were an outcast of society as well thrown out of churches because something was in you was calling for something greater and people make fun of you as you begin to work in this field but god was raising you to another level this world is not a home we are the queen of heaven [Applause] our past aliens in this world seems like no certain future for some of us we look at our human frailty here i stand as a representative to you doctors concerned where i'm standing at giving me all different kinds of directions but i choose to look at the words i choose to look at a greater doctor's words my attitude is to where that god has me in the palm of his hands i choose to trust him beyond doctor's words i'm thankful for doctor's words i'm thankful for medicine but i'm thankful for the words of eternal life should i die before mourning i want you to understand don't cry for me i'll be rejoicing in another land sometimes people have plans for you that's not god's plans you must remain in the field stay there be content it's just like what we're doing right now we're working in the field of the message we're just before the coming of the lord we can see the dispensations changing we've turned the corner the wind of change has turned the season has changed i'm not talking about fall to winter but the season has changed you can feel the wind changing there's something among us as a believers the angel is among us working the bride's revival is happening among us and we recognize we're not where we were 50 years ago or 20 years ago or even 10 years ago but we recognize that we're closer to the coming of the lord than ever before we have stayed in the field we have worked some of us have been here 40 50 years and you've continued to work don't never let it become boring don't never get discontent with it just keep eating the book just keep eating those handfuls on purpose like ruth just have some words i want to share with you just like ruth you got to keep from falling in love with the personalities of men don't fall in love with elohizer keep your eyes only on jesus we want to love the men that's preaching to us but those men didn't save us we love brother branham but brother branham couldn't save himself he was born of a sinful nature just like me and you tonight i understand that that might go contrary to a lot of people but i want you to understand brother branham couldn't pay for his own sins but neither are we just a community church where we come and get a certain recipe and take on a church spirit or take on the pastor's spirit we're to fall in love with christ [Applause] and to feed on this word like never before emotion is wonderful and i love it in your marriage you gotta have emotion well six of you are still happily married and we're really glad for you [Applause] i'm gonna run that by you one more time maybe you was asleep maybe you but your wife is listening emotion is part of your marriage let me just describe it to you emotion sometimes has worship with it i love you really amen you could have said i love you like that to an apple but when you say it with meaning when you worship in church with meaning [Applause] when it comes from the depths of your heart when it's more than the service leader unction you forward we come to church to be inspired we come to church to be encouraged we come to kurt church to be uplifted nobody likes to be talked down to [Applause] i encourage ministers as they walk through this pulpit these people have sat here and listened they've got doctorals in the message don't talk down to them this is the bride of jesus christ and if a man ever talks down to his wife he will never come back here again we come here to be inspired to be encouraged why are you saying that brother ron because we get enough of the other from the world we're the queen of heaven and i'm encouraging you to keep the course it's like esther asked her caretaker what does the king like i'm not here to fall in love with the preacher but what does jesus like so we want to dress like jesus wants us to dress and we want to talk like jesus wants us to talk and we want to live like jesus wants us to live ruth is going to lay at his feet literally to the point to hear him breathe let me just say if you lay in the atmosphere of jesus christ you'll smell like a rose of sharon god will become personal revelation to you and to your children i like these words when i fall he lifts me up when i fail he forgives me when i'm weak he is strong when i'm lost he is the way when i am afraid he is my courage when i stumble he leads me when i am hurt he heals me when i am broken he mends me when i am blind he leads me when i'm hungry he feeds me when i face trials he is with me when i face persecution he shields me when i face problems he comforts me when i face loss he provides for me when i face death he carries me home he is god he is our kinsman redeemer when boaz is going to to take ruth he has to forgive her past he has to look at her and and what she is she has a house and he has to redeem naomi the land and all that comes with it and then take ruth as his bride now sometimes we want forgiveness but she has to have the ability to forgive those that's made fun of her this time as the queen of heaven must keep your spirit clean trash may come up but you got to keep your spirit clean your mind might get filthy at times but you got to keep your mind clean let the sweetness of god wash you sure you've got to pass but put the pass in the burial put it in the blood of jesus christ don't continue to dig those bones up don't glory in the good old days they wasn't good [Applause] i'm going to say it again so i make sure it lands don't glory in the good old days they wasn't good you're a new creation you're a new man you're a new lady your scars are healed now god don't just do that to just see if he can do it but now you've got to exercise forgiveness somebody does you wrong forgive them but brother on it hurts so bad but god tells you to forgive 70 times 7 a day 490 times a day it may not fix them but it'll help you [Applause] ruth had to choose to raise her head above them brother branham had to choose to raise his head above all of those ministers that were making fun of him [Applause] let me just say they wasn't paying him they may have been doctors of divinity they may have been powerful preachers of great denominations but they didn't call him it was an angel in a cave from another dimension that stood with him and regardless of what their words were he could have lowered himself to their standards but he raised his head above that [Applause] by the biscuit marvel that people saying things about brother branham that were destructive and he asked brother branham one day how do you do that and brother branham responds and i'm just paraphrasing he said they have to do those things because they're called to do it and these things must be brother bishop said i i realized i wasn't living at his level and we're all in growth and let me just say we all have not handled things well at times it says clean the slate there's been times where none of us handle things well and it's easy to get a fighting spirit [Music] i have to tell you it's easy to get a fighting spirit but you can either lower yourself arrange yourself [Applause] brother ron i need a i need i need an example okay jesus allows them to spit on him to say every evil thing that they could be on his way to the cross because he's got you on him on his mind and he cannot lure himself to who they are to lose his position it's kinsmen redeemer and their vileness of trying to make him stop to go to calvary satan is throwing his wrath at him so quickly and so vile and so putrid to try to make him step out of his position what about us what about us we're so close to the rapture satan is trying to throw his wrath and his vow and he's working this on these things must be they must be even jesus return he said blessed is he that is not offended in me whew is freely given jesus expresses this with a woman that's caught in adultery and the scripture said she's supposed to be stoned but the preachers that brought her by the offense even to tempt jesus with it jesus writes on the ground and he said he that is without sin cast the first stone i want to i want to present a thought to you if they had a throat of stone jesus could have just simply told what they were doing last tuesday and then they would be stoned so they were convicted by their own conscience a woman comes in to wash jesus's feet now jesus lets her wash his feet but he exercises forgiveness nobody in the scriptures had ever did it he exercises forgiveness and he said simon and he rebuked simon because simon had brought him there to make fun of him but now the wheels are turned and simon was red-faced and he looks at the woman and he said though our sins be many he says go thy way and sin no more now the difference between what jesus can do and what man can do it's kind of like a credit card a man's got 25 000 on his credit card he'll never get that paid off you pay the minimum you'll never get that paid off i don't care what your debtor tells you you'll never get it paid off if you only pay the minimum i don't mean to make you mad here but maybe i'll repeat teach a business class credit card is one of the worst things that you can possibly ever get yourself enslaved to if you can't pay it off every 30 days you don't need that baby doll stick it burn it put it in the freezer do whatever get rid of that thing and don't become a slave to it but somebody can pay your debt off but if you're not changed you go right back out and begin to make new debt [Applause] now notice jesus didn't shame the woman for being in a situation the woman at the well he didn't shame her for being in that situation he raised her from where she was to where she could be that's what god did for you he didn't shame you and make fun of you and beat you and frail you he raised you from where you was and he showed you what you could be and he gave you the ability we've got some examples hosea in the scriptures is standing at an auction he's reflecting god and he buys a harlot because that's what a type of the church was a harlot church to man's systems and many of us were in harlot systems but god was rich in mercy he didn't leave us where he found us [Applause] hallelujah and you found your way to the field because he guided you there [Applause] you say god's never did nothing for me i want you to know look where you are and look where you were many people come to opportunity of life same opportunity that you had and they walked away but you can never wash jesus off of your hands it leaves souls haunted they'll go out in sin but that righteousness that that real life always is pulling back they want to do better they want to do better maybe show up in church a couple weeks a year i want to do better i want to i'm making promises i'm never going to leave this again let me just say unless you go far enough with christ you'll always be going back and there's nothing forgive me but there's nothing in the hog pin this world is a hog pin compared to what god's beauty feels just read the newspaper the stabbings and just at that rock concert the other day were about eight or ten people died because the guy was screaming to him make a stampede and they make a stampede and they started stampeding under that spirit and destroyed people's lives now the guy calls himself innocent for doing it an inspiration from hell it feeds on the flesh that it makes fun of [Music] they don't want cops they don't want police officers they don't want judges they don't want lawfulness they don't want headship we're coming to a lawless society that's going into a tribulation period yet the people that are saying we don't want police officers or are getting private security and i read the other day that the kardashians spend a half a million dollars a month to be protected i don't want that kind of fame wouldn't mind having a half a million dollars a month but no i wouldn't either and i don't want that you say but i've grieved my soul away brother brown gives an example of a woman that you know she left his church made fun of things and she wound up and she wound up to another church and they made her a sunday school teacher she left one husband married another and left one husband married another one from church to church and church but brother brown lived long enough to watch that woman feel her cycle up and she came to die and she came to die brother bam said that her soul came back haunting her because she knew what was right and she carnerized her conscience i'm preaching to somebody she cauterized her conscience to where it was seared to where it wouldn't bother her no more let me just say the devil will talk to you into smoking one cigarette and then you'll do it on your own he'll talk you into committing adultery one time and then you'll do it on your own he'll talk you into drinking wine the first time and then you'll do it on your own you want you want go listen to from that time that's where that all comes from but you don't have to go there brother brahm said the god of the bible will make you like jesus his spirit will dwell in you and all of your life will be changed that temper that malice that unforgiven spirit that thing will canker your soul in a lost eternity he said brother ron i'm still carrying i'm still carrying grudges in my life let me just say ruth had to lay her grudges down and her unforgiving spirit down to where she could be the queen to be the queen of heaven you've got to overcome yourself and let me just say your own worst enemy is yourself the men that came to take brother branham's newspaper and his his radio programs and all of those things away from him brother branham knew what those papers were he acted ignorant and went on and signed them anyway he told brothers before they came of what they were going to do to him and he signed them anyway and they were in a hurry to leave the the house and he asked them to preach that night i'd say his field was way beyond their feel boy this is good isn't it brother branham was living at a place you can make fun of him all you want to do but he lit way beyond the average bear when they were offering him the phenomenal amounts of money brother biscuit saw the check for a million dollars brother branham said what could i do with that i want to ask you i dare say there's a hundred percent of the televangelists today none of them would turn it down none of them would turn it down well brother brandon said what i do with that what would i do with that now what now that's brother branham but what about us what about us what what's our god what's the tangle what tries to get us out of the field i was offered politics as rotten as it is you hear me blast politics that's what i was offered amen i was offered hollywood as a young man i was offered hollywood i turned that down money i was offered that but i got news for you god's the best payer and i'm not talking about the salary of a church i've seen him in business i've seen him in business where he said i'll make you the head and not the tail i want you to know this church young people if you put god first if you put him first in everything i'm going to make a statement here it'll pay you better than any ira [Applause] any stock because god is the best businessman that i know he's honest he's pure he's holy and i've talked these two boys that preached to you you be honest every day in every decision you be honest if you have to lie brother brahma said you'll have to tell 17 lies to cover up that one lie but if you're honest [Music] [Applause] folks if you live an honest life you don't have to cover up no place in your life somebody ought to shout hallelujah ruth had critics but she didn't let her critics destroy her jesus had critics but she didn't let her critics he didn't let his critics destroy him brother branham had critics you'll have critics young people i want to point to every one of you tonight and i want you to know you're going to come against them forces but raise your head above it you want to see some successful people look around at some of these gray heads i would rather set where earnest meta sets than donald trump i would rather set where bill hinkle sits vernon frazier sets these pillars in this church sets now let me go to the other side of the aisle i'd rather sit where linda hinkle and kathy and pat and these sister sucks sister joyce and sister evelyn than any hollywood movie star that there is in the world that's the field that i want to work in let's stand to our feet tonight god bless you god bless you lord isn't it good to us is any good to us i know this hadn't been no lightning dancing thunder rolling sermon but this is this is the feeding the feeding of the word that strengthens you amen it's the nuts and bolts preaching that keeps you straight now i want to be very honest with you in the secrecy of my prayers i pray god keep my spirit clean my water that comes out of a well we have filters on that water brother jonathan put some water some filters on my water i had filters i had several filters on it because in in having a filter you get the sediments out of it and you want to drink clean and when it comes to the word of god i don't want malice and envy and hatred and temper and an unforgiving spirit to be the filter on my holy ghost even in my prayer i want to be able to forgive that's the lord's prayer forgive your trespassers forgive those that do evil against you now it may never do them no good and you may never see no change in them but you'll see the change in you amen and let me just drop one more nugget to you it'll bring you peace it'll bring you peace it's many many marriages are built that forget the golden rule never
