house of the lord each and every one of you we thank you for taking taking the time to be here this morning i believe god's got some special things in store for us and uh before we go to the word i just want to make a few mentions i know brother matthew has went over these things about the fall fellowship just it pays to go over things twice because sometimes we become feeble-minded and forget what was said and and we i know there's a lot of distractions during the day but we want to make sure that you get the the message and so just a reminder that next sunday there'll be no service here at the church but it'll be grand caverns there in grotto's if you don't know the directions you can look it up on you on your google and uh they it'll be starting at 11 we'd like for you to be there around 11 o'clock and then we'll start to eat around 11 30 11 45 and during that little gap or window we'll be doing some preliminary things and setting up throughout the day and different things making some comments maybe maybe speaking just for a few moments there but but we're planning to eat around 11 30 11 45 and we were able to do it again and uh so i think you all enjoyed it pretty good so we we went ahead and ordered the ice cream truck again for you and uh i know i know i sure i sure enjoy those things so so just be a real witness to to anybody that you see we're gonna we're gonna have it on speakers and we never know what what the lord will witness i know that sometimes even jesus had people that followed him for the fishes and the loaves and i'm sure there'll be somebody that'll show up there you might just smile and nod and say god bless you and uh but dress decently like you always do but dress accordingly to the time and the season normally we make this about a fall deal and so you can dress according how you want to don't show up in your pajamas but we're going to be putting this in a church book and if sister sue when you go to put that thing together somebody shows up in their pajamas you show it to me first i don't want that in there i don't believe that anybody here will but we may have a strangler show up that might do that so so anyways but so we we thank you for preparing for that we thank you we always enjoy this time and this this we were we all we always just joy our fellowship there's there's a lot of churches that that are blessed around the the message and have some of the finest people but there's no church like full gospel lighthouse and i always enjoy getting to set shoulder to shoulder with you and enjoy the day it's it's a type of what we'll be doing in eternity and we're just looking forward to that also just another mention because of uh because of the app that we have been using for our youth our young adult choir some of some of the attendants that that use that app if you don't use it in a while it'll this uh this load there but this evening at the cabin uh there'll be there'll be a youth group for for 12 and above it's not for anybody below that age but it's for the 12 and above and that is it from 5 to 7 this evening and if you have not have not received that text or whatever just please let us know but we want to make you aware that's for the 12 and above you know how to get there by now and so we just we're just excited about what god is doing in our youth and certainly privileged to have malachi charity with us taken out of their time i know that i know that they're a great big part of of bible tabernacle there and in shaw's ville but we're sure happy to have them here it's amazing to see what god is doing and i'm not trying to point out a spencer family or trying to point anything out like that but it's amazing to watch what god is doing we've got one word again and god's going to do his work because i believe with all of my heart that the time is at hand amen maybe we just sing that song there's nobody like you one more time as we just set the stage for the for the word to come amen [Music] there's nobody like you lord there's nobody like you lord [Music] there's nobody like you lord there's nobody like you [Music] [Applause] there's nobody like you lord there's nobody like you lord [Music] there's nobody like you lord [Music] there's nobody [Music] who taught the sun wears [Music] ocean you can only come this far [Music] [Applause] [Music] to whose words alone can catch [Music] [Music] oh i know [Music] oh let all creation testify [Music] [Music] teamers [Music] the very same god that spins things [Music] we and the same tits or hands that hold me when i'm broken [Applause] to bring me [Music] victory yes i know yes i know [Music] oh i know that my [Music] oh yes this testifies [Music] i know [Music] hallelujah we know that he lives i know that he lives how many here has a need this morning by the way of an uplifted hand this morning that you'd like to make known unto the lord amen the church world can put on their shows the church world has to have a stage light and they have to have fog machines to create an element of atmosphere but the bride of jesus christ sets the atmosphere by her worship they have to set with fog machines and different things to create a cloud but that cloud has followed this bride he's the one that makes the presence milky all over he's the one that comes in a confirmation of the holy ghost let's just lift our hands unto him just now father god we come before you lord knowing and recognizing that that the nearness of the holy ghost is here just now lord you have come and you have inhabited the praises of your people the atmosphere has said lord for the miraculous to take place now father we just we just want to humble ourselves before you lord you see our our needs lord do you see every prayer request you see the things that we hold on our heart lord heavy burdens we don't have the answer to we know that you are the key to opening the door that will unlock every answer father i pray you lord as we would just step into the word just for a moment the holy ghost would take over you would begin to minister lord i i understand the responsibility that is placed upon the shoulders of the priest so i'm asking lord for just a little a lift lord i'm asking that you would take me and set me down in a corner as i yield myself to you father lord may you use this tabernacle in the name of jesus christ and the bride says amen if you have your bible this morning we'll turn again over into revelations chapter 1 and verse 1. trust me we didn't bore any of you last night i'm doing a little bit of foundation work so that we can do a little bit of preaching today so if you'll help me preach i believe god will do something real special for you amen so by the help of the lord we'd like to speak to you again on this thought the time the time is at hand revelations chapter 1 and verse 1 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john you can find that john describes and prescribes here that all of these things were sent and signified by the angel all the way through the book of revelation you'll see john writing these things who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand may god bless his word you may be seated in the presence of the most high god blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and we realize that as we went through last night that god is is an eternal being and he does not operate in time but god has a time piece and he is working and if you want to see god's time peace we are told that we are to look and see that israel is god's timepiece you watch where israel's at and you'll see where god is moving in and we realize that the very same night that the angel of the lord came and gave a commission to go and to take this message to a gentile bride that it was the same night or in the same hour in the same moments of time that the angel that the angel was commissioning a prophet to come and bring a message to this generation it was at the same time that israel was becoming a nation where she hadn't been a nation for over thousands of years and now we are looking at a scene that has been set up by the kingdom of god and now now we look as human beings if we if we maybe been in a state of a coma and we've been out of things and we can't understand time and we're coming back too and and we've been out and we haven't seen different things we maybe been in a hospital or something all you have to do is just look out the window and look at the scene that you're seeing and you can see the time and the season that you're in you can look out the windows now and you're starting to watch that we are in the season of fall you're watching people put on put on flannel jackets and and flannel flannel shirts and different things you're seeing that they are recognizing that there is a time that is coming and you begin to watch that the season is at hand even nature will tell us what the seasons are but we're not just watching to recognize what nature is telling us but we are recognizing our day and its message and when you begin to watch and recognize the day and your message then there becomes a release so a power to bring an understanding just like when jesus was walking with his disciples on the road to emmaus they didn't know that that was him they drew not because he he drew an eye unto them because they were speaking about these things and that's how he will always draw close unto you as a people is when you begin to fellowship and you begin to talk about the things of god and you begin to rehearse what he was doing and what he was what he what he did and we thought this was the messiah but you'll watch as it began to take them and she began to walk with them down the road he took them he took them all the way from genesis all the ray to revelation he showed them who he was by the scripture but we realized that the preaching of the word never did no good it didn't he didn't recognize they didn't recognize that this was him but notice what they did when it come down to the end of the day they come down there and they constrained him the bible said that they pulled on him to come on the inside and when he got on the inside that's when he showed himself and when you get christ on the inside of you that is when you'll begin to recognize that this is him and we are aware that this is him that is doing these works this is him notice it took them all day long to take this journey but in a minute in a moment in time they begin to run back to the city where they had just came notice they were hitting the wrong way they were going away from where he was going to be but he said go back and tell my disciples that i that you have handled me you have seen me and this is the resurrected lord jesus christ and that is the same thing that he is doing here at full gospel lighthouse he didn't move on your pastor's heart just to set out a bunch of chairs for no reason he set it out lord placed it on our heart to fill this place and it is your job and our job to compel them to come we must work while it is day for night is coming we realize that over in the book of zechariah in 14 that we realize that it shall be light in the evening time and we realize that the light that is shining on the word of god today is your life it is taking you to a spot in a place of time and putting you into eternity this light won't leave you the light left the denominations but the light won't leave the bride of jesus christ we are destined to fulfill what he has said in the scriptures that there will be a people that'll be perfect that'll be blameless that'll be spotless there'll be blood bought have you had have you come to have church this morning [Applause] hallelujah now notice in in in the church age book he says now the time is at hand reading from genesis or revelations one he said the time is at hand the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of god this mighty revelation though fully known to god could not come forth hitherto thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of god for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time he says look at the history of israel look at the history of israel the revelation of god to moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto god and jesus himself came at the fulfillment at the fullness of time notice let me read that again look at the history of israel the revelation of god to moses came only at a specific time of history and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto god notice there was a season for these things to come to pass notice god knows the time but there was a desire on the people's heart and he heard the cry of his people he said i am going down there to take over i have heard the cry of my people he knows what you've been crying in this last day he knows what you're going through he understands the times and the season that you're operating in let me come down just a little bit more in the natural for you he understands what you're going through in your body he understands that you're in a time element you're in a time element in a body and he knows exactly what you have need of if if he says that there's healing for you you're in the perfect season for healing are you with me we look back in the river in the old testament and by revelation we look and see that there was a bomb in gilead and they could go to a physician that would heal their bodies but here what was it pointing to is that there was one coming that would take the stripes at pilot's judgment hall and he would completely make you healed if you would operate the faith to step into that realm what happened 2000 years ago was just what was seen before the foundation of the world now let me let me come down a little bit further when you receive that healing it was also seen before the foundation of the world you may have received it in this time but it was happening before the foundation of the world god saw what you were going through notice and jesus himself came at the fulfillness at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age of laodicea and the revelation of god will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today we realize that and i've been setting this before you not even knowing what he was leading me to but i've been setting this before you that this is the grandest of all days that the opportunity that you and i have been given is the opportunities that paul and the band enoch and elijah they long for these opportunities and we realize that we are living in the grandest and the greatest of all times because this is the finishing up of redemption and we are watching the blending of time with the blending of eternity that which was a prophet's prophecy you are now the fulfillment of it and here we are in this element of time each and every one of us have 24 hours in our day we have a lot of time that we are going to live but what are you going to do with your time what are you going to do with the rest of your life young people what are you going to do are you going to choose to serve mammon are you going to choose to serve god are you going to choose to serve yourself in the pleasures of life or are you going to live a dedicated life yield it completely to the holy ghost it's up to you what you do but this is your time this is your moment and i am determined to live my moment out i'm determined to live my life out i'm determined this is my time this ain't this a day this ain't the day of paul this ain't the day of luther this ain't the day of wesley this ain't the day of the pentecostals this is the day of the bride of jesus christ this is our time and if it is our time i'm going to live it out i'm not going to live it out halfway i'm going to put all that i've got into this thing well you say brother andrew i don't know i don't know how i'm going to make it i don't know what you're going to have to make some tough decisions to come out and stand for this message you're going to have to make some tough decisions to go into a rapture you're going to have to make some tough decisions to make a body change but it'll be worth it all you know you well i just i keep getting knocked down why don't you get up and try if you might shock yourself how well you will succeed at some point this is what i keep on losing but sometimes people get comfortable with losing they get comfortable with always failing some people get comfortable with backsliding in church and they sit there like a bump on a pickle they sit there like a bump on a log never lift their hand i'm not talking about anybody here but i'm just preaching to spirits that don't want to die and they get comfortable setting in their comfort zone and sitting there in their backslidden condition you didn't backslide when you got out there in the world you got sick you got backslidden right here in church you have a day of visitation and when you turn it down you are backsliding and you get cool on god and think my jesus nobody loves me nobody understands what i'm going through are you even alive this is the greatest time that the world has ever seen you are the most powerful people on the face of this earth this is your time this is not your time to have a pity party this is not a time to stay in a backslidden condition this is your time to have full and complete victory this ain't a time to get upset this is a time to get upset at the devil this ain't a time to get discouraged this is a time to take courage and be quick like men young people it's the greatest day that you ever lived here you are living in an hour you're living in an hour we're watching in the dispensation of the baptism of the holy ghost when those that long to have it when david would have loved to have it you are now sitting there in heavenly places enthroned by the holy ghost i've been dealing with a certain individual and i wouldn't say this i wouldn't say this openly or i wouldn't even say this because i understand that when you recognize something that demons when you mention something that demons get scared and to begin to run and i'm real careful i'm real careful about mentioning this the spirit but i i want to identify where you're at personally i have i have prayed i have prayed for more suicide in the last year than i ever have in all of my life i have prayed for more depression this year than i ever have in all of my life why it's because of the timing and the seasons now notice notice now now now i wouldn't stand up here and say i wouldn't stand up here and say that there is a power that can knock that suicide spirit down unless there was i wouldn't stand up here and say that there's a power that is greater than a depression spirit and an anxiety spirit and even the spirit of unworthiness even the spirit of i'm not wanted or even the spirit of i i don't know you know i don't know if i can make it or not it is a spirit of the time of the age you notice you have never seen an age like this where women have had so much trouble to have babies it seems like there's a barrenness upon the ladies of this day that they long to be a mother they long to have a child but notice it's a spirit that is on the age to try to shut down the very life that is coming out because you see it doesn't matter what you go through it doesn't matter what happens to you if it is an elect seed it's got to come forth just like when moses was put in a bull rush it didn't look like he was going to make it in the natural eye but there was angels that was encamped about it and he told gable to go down there and put your foot on the ark of that bell and when there would be a crocodile come up if he would have gotten a little whirlpool gabriel was there to get him out of it and if there's an elected seed don't you worry about that barren spirit don't you worry about that suicide spirit don't you worry about that depression god will go to that seed and god will wake it up suicide has no hold over the lord jesus christ and i want you to say this greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world greater than suicide greater than depression greater than fear greater than kova greater than stigmas greater than complexes greater than depression greater than cancer greater than world greater than laodicea greater you got what it takes you got what it takes to make it through laodicea you got what it takes to be an overcomer you got what it takes to be more than a survivor you got what it takes but do you have the willingness to win it you've got to be destined and you got to be determined i am in this thing to win this thing come hell or come high water i am going to shoot for the stars if i hit a stump every single time i'd rather try and fail than not try at all i am in this thing to win this thing i am not put here to be a lazy backslidden so-called christian of the day i am put here to be an overcoming devil stopping serpent bruiser bride of jesus christ elected seed before the foundation of the world because the time is at hand take a look around you're looking at a bunch of giant killers oh i dare one to step up in the house of god pick up a stone [Applause] where's that depression at where's that suicide at where's that anxiety at where's that layout i see and flu spirit at i got a rock in my hand i got a swing i got a sword what power can stand against you [Applause] rahab ran her race jacob ran his race abraham ran his race isaac ran his race jesus ran his race paul ran his race what what the time would fall us to tell you bayrock and all of these others they ran their race but they cannot be perfect without you sister debbie they cannot be perfect let me drop it down a little bit higher brother homer sister irene brother wayne cannot be perfect unless you run it is your time to pick up the baton you're the final runner to the final age pick it up don't leave it down don't drop it run run you got a message to run with the time is at hand you always save the best till last you put the guy you put the guy in the clean up spot because you know what he can do with it i know what you can do with this but are you determined i know what this word will do i know that it defeats satan anytime any place anywhere what is in your hand moses i know that you got the goods to do it but are you determined to do it well glory glory glory [Applause] amen some people saying amen some people saying oh me oh my help me lord jesus i have found myself in the positive part of this word this is my time this ain't the devil's time this ain't the time for him to win over top of me this ain't him that isn't a time for him to conquer it's my time to conquer it's my time to win it's my time to see these young people get a baptism of the holy ghost and stop living with a lie of the devil they tell them to never be good enough they'll never be healed they'll never make it i'm here to prove that the devil is alive he told me i'd never make it he told me i'd never be a son of god i am here to prove that the devil is a liar there were some people turned down that message book but there was two sons of god that said i'll be identified this is my time hallelujah let us a lot of so-called christians of the day didn't want none of this acts 2 38 blabbering hollering screaming acts 2 38 young is that that she thinks they are but this is the only kind that the word can bring forth them important people wouldn't rise up but god raised up a generation it was a time in moses day when the generation they wouldn't go no far they wouldn't go no farther they done had their sacrifices they didn't had their complaint but god said i'm raising up a new generation hallelujah father the hour has come the time has come that god will gather his church together under one great big banner of the lord jesus christ and pour out his powers among them and great signs and wonders will take place the time has come the time has come for the pentecostal church to make a stand the time has come to circumcise the church and call out this foolishness the time has come to go back to the old landmark the time has come for the outpouring the time has come for the gathering of the people the time has come for jesus to come and the time will be here soon to give out all the rewards the time is here you're dealing with a time vessel but this is your time you remember when joshua when he was standing there in the worst of times when the river was all muddy and it looked like there was no way possible for them to get across you know god chooses some of the hardest times to bring his children through something you ain't dead you've been living you take a look what you're looking for day but god is still god take a look about what you've been going through the past year and a half as a church then just take a look at what kovit's done it's it is so it is such a dividing spirit that it's coming to vision and try to break up the unity of the church of the living god but i am going to stand here as a pastor and i am going to break the bondage [Music] a division that would try to come in and divide you amongst the people and say well you got to have it this way or you got to have it that way it is god's way or no way [Applause] you can take a shot if you want to you can take a pill if you want to you can wear a mask if you want to but i'm going to stick with jesus that don't bother me in the human realm you do whatever you want to but you better have the seal of the holy ghost the seal of the holy ghost is the only thing that'll keep the devil off of you and the reason why you're afraid to say amen is because you don't have to seal the holy ghost on you but if you did it i'll go over here and preach to the flag at least she stands for liberty if you'd get up and get the holy ghost one good time you'd stop your pounding spirit you'd stop your little pity party i got cancer look at our pastor he has been beaten down over and over and over again it was not his time to die it is his time to live it's his time to preach it's his time to dance over top of the devil what did joshua do [Applause] so go out there and get some rocks go out there and get some rocks and set them up as a memorial that this is where we crossed over this is where it happened at we're leaving everything behind us over here we come out of egypt but we can't think like egyptians no more we can't think like slaves no more man we can't think like that more no more we can't feel like the enemy is going to chase us down remember your enemy already died in the red sea if you'd stop thinking with that kind of mentality that it's the devil's time but you need to wake up and realize this is your time the enemy that you see today you will see no more what say brother andrew if you go to reading over there in exodus chapter 14 moses said that why christ speak and he said that and the waters opened up and they crossed over on dry ground but did you notice did you notice brother andrew they actually did see their enemies again when they were floating on top of the water drowned it was not their bodies that he was talking about he was talking about them spirits well i guess the prophet failed he got us this far but he couldn't get us to rest away let me tell you every demon has been defeated every spirit has been defeated the only way that it ain't been defeated is if you resurrect that thing and you give it power oh come on somebody the only way that people walk around with a pity party is because they give it life the only way you ain't got to live under the bondage of the devil not a day one more time you ain't got to live under depression you ain't got to live under anxiety and all of those things are back problems and cancer and mind battles you are the one that's given that thing life i choose to live i choose to worship god i choose to stand on my two feet and proclaim the ver the very liberty of jesus christ [Applause] you stack these things up right here you stack this word up you stack this word up and you point back to them this is where we came over and this make it down mark it down as a memorial as a memorial that you can go back and remember remember remember what you came out of there's power in remembrance but not the devil's remembrance there's power in remembrance i'm deciding i'm gonna burn the bridge for there's no way for me to get back over there i don't know who i'm preaching to but i'm preaching set it up as a memorial that you remember this you tell your children you tell your children this how we came over you mark it down this how i got the holy ghost and the bible said in acts chapter 2 and verse 38 repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost this promise is unto you and to your children as many as our lord our god shall call what the church had in pentecost was her inalienable right and it cannot be taken away from her and if god is still calling the apostolic days are not over yet mark it down you can have the holy ghost micah you can have it sharon knows you can have reagan and india and titus can apollo john and dan can have the holy ghost joshua ran his race [Applause] georgie carter ran her race congressman upshaw ran his race had hannah wright ran her race but you got something to remember young people you got something to remember brian of jesus christ you can point back he's just saying yesterday today and forever he got me out of that hole one time he'll get me out of the hole again [Applause] david would say in psalms 31 and 15 my times are in my hand my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of my enemies and from them that persecute me so here david is saying everything that is pertaining unto him was under the control and the disposal of god and he would live as long as god said that he would live i don't know what the future looks like but i know i'm in good hands i can't tell you what tomorrow looks like but i had a pastor tell me a couple weeks ago my future is clear it was clear wasn't it sister julia it's clear it's clear god's got your timing and when god speaks anything he forces it to a place and if you go to studying out the message of junction of time take it down write it down listen to it this week couple times three or four times but the junction of time it's one of the most powerful to me it's one of the most powerful messages and you'll get nuggets out of there like nobody's business but brother branham is coming and he's preaching about the junction of time that there is junctions on the road the highways that you and i work at and what we drive on but what is it it's a changeover a junction is a changeover on the road it's a blending of roads the two are coming and you're watching you've got to make a decision which way you want to go it is a junction of time and you remember that that the bible said in revelations chapter 3 when he was speaking to the church and to give the angel that the angel was come to say that this is given unto you that the key would be to him to open and no man shutteth and to shut and no man open and here the bible said jesus is standing there preaching to the church age the philadelphian church age he said i have set before thee an open door that no man can shut for thou has a little strength for thou has little strength and has kept my word and become has not denied my name but notice what he is doing he is saying he is saying to you i have set before you an open door and we realize that this last stage the six age and the seventh age are an overlapping they are melting together there is a junction of time and there's never been a time like the last two ages when you watch the spirit of revelation of who god is blossom out in these last two ages like it has here in the six age and the seventh age brother branham said the six age came to abrupt end he said he said it didn't come to abrupt end he said it just flowed right into the next age and here it was overlapping and he said i have set before you an open door and we all know that jesus told us over in john chapter 10 he said i am the door to the sheepfold and if you go and i'm not going to spend much time on it but if you you go and study out what this shepherd is that over in the eastern country that the shepherd actually becomes the door he lays down at the door so nothing can come in and nothing can go out unless it comes by the shepherd and jesus said i have set before you an open door we know who the door is it's never been like this before all the other five ages they were looking at it they were looking at it through the reformation but here we are with an eagle eye anointing and not only is do we see the door but we see the opening of the door there is an entrance that is being ministered under the bride of jesus christ and you're realizing that god is who he said he is that jesus is god that there's no other name like the name of jesus christ there's nobody like our lord there's nobody more powerful than our lord it's only in the name of the lord jesus christ that the sick are healed it's only in the name of jesus christ that salvation comes it's only in the name of jesus christ that cancer is defeated it's only in the name of jesus christ that the laodicean flu is defeated but here in this age of melting together of the junction of time you are watching as there is an overlapping because thou has little strength notice what this revelation of who he is does it brings a strength to the church to stand there in the word and to never deny his name this open door is set before you young people and no man can shut it it was not the time for the door to open in past age but here we are at a junction if you go to listen that message i'm gonna point some things out to you because you you're gonna you're gonna listen to it i know you will but brother random brother madam said now he said you watched those junctions every single time that there was a junction there was there was angels there was signs that were there and miraculous was done to prove the omnipotence is that right is that right now notice notice and always in the days gone by and the dispensations has always come to their end and we hit a junction and there's junctions on the highways the junction on the road that we travel on this world they junction on this grand old highway that we travel to glory and it always takes the miraculous to speak of omnipotence and omnipotence is the all-powerful and it takes the miraculous to vindicate the omnipotence and only the miraculous can do that you'll notice teaching of the word is a very fine thing and when it can we when it comes faith comes by hearing and hearing the word but it always takes the miraculous to vindicate that the omnipotence still lives and reigns we must have the miraculous at every single junction in time he performed the miraculous and prove that omnipotent still was miraculous so there was a prophecy and then there it met in time and the miraculous was produced just like when abraham when abraham had been promised for all of those years that he was going to bring forth he was going to bring forth a child and he patiently endured waiting for the promise he'd been told that he was going to come he had been told that it was going to happen but like i told you last night don't look at the clock look at the promise don't look at the calendar don't look at the ears don't look at that look don't look back but look at what the promise said your case is a whole lot better than abraham's your case a whole lot better than sarah's it seemed hopeless it seemed impossible but i'm gonna ask you like the lord ask them is there anything too hard for the lord amen is there anything too hard for the lord i'm like paul would say in ephesians 3 and 20 unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ever ask or think according to the power that worketh in us i believe that he's able because he's able i believe that he will because he will we're not just a people that believe that he can i believe that he will i don't just believe that he can put me in a rapture i believe he will put me in a rapture i don't just believe that he can heal my pastor i know that he will heal my pastor [Applause] but against our odds against all the all the time that was stacked up before him time and science is god's greatest enemy because men get caught up in the delay of time and they think well god hasn't done it yet but against all these odds abraham believed he believed and what was abraham doing that day he was sitting out there at the tent of the door and he was creating an atmosphere maybe the party behind it wasn't creating the right kind of an atmosphere but abraham was out there creating the right kind of an atmosphere for the miraculous to come and the atmosphere was set and when those angels came at the junction there melchizedek met him and the miraculous took place notice what the bible said in genesis 21 that at the void at the appointed time that the lord visited sarah it was a set time so let me say it to you like this your miracle is a setup your healing is a setup oh my i hope i hold myself together just now my miracles are set up the signs and wonders is a setup they're at a set time and you may figure everything out in your reasoning power but it's a set up to show that god is still god and he still works miracles and he still does the miraculous and every time at a junctions the angels come to prove that he's still the omnipotent abraham created abraham created an atmosphere i don't know what he was doing out there maybe he was fellowshipping maybe he was maybe he was just thinking about all the promises brother saying that he'd been told about that he'd been told about his son that was that was going to come to pass and maybe he got the singing a song well there's a happy land a promise over in the great beyond i don't know how isaac's going to get there but i'm going to produce a son and he got out there and he created an atmosphere and he began to worship and all of a sudden melchizedek came what did brother burnham said that he went over there and he started nursing off the bosom of el shaddai that he went over there and what was he doing i want you to know that el shaddai is the strong one he is more powerful than any interview your foes and all you got to do is nurse on the old and the new testament he is the breasted one and watch what abraham did he nursed on the bosom of el shaddai and he pulled out a new body and he pulled out a new son what are you doing proud of jesus christ you're nursing your body change right out of our shady eye i'm gonna get wrapped up tied up tangled up in jesus [Applause] he was creating an atmosphere and the miraculous took place this third pool cannot be impersonated the devil can try all he wants to to tap into the resource and the channel that we're in brother jerry but he don't know nothing about it now now i want you i want to make something real clear to you i know that there's impersonators in the land and i'm not foolish enough to think that there's no impersonators in the message you watch people sometimes how they worship and how they how they do things they're not entering into a worship with him worship is not about a show but worship is about worship it's about praise it's about honor it's not about a show anything that happens up here let me tell you if it happens up here out of show you won't get to sing again i won't get to sing again i won't get to preach again i won't do anything i won't do anything that'll hinder this ministry but if it's a show if it's a show it'll not produce any works but if it's a real worship and abraham had tapped into a channel of worship and the bride of jesus christ has tapped into a channel of worship and you might you might say well i don't know if i need to be sitting this close or not i you know i'm up here in that corner where it seems to be a lot of jumping going on i don't necessarily know if i need to be up there you might stick around that angel might bump into you but notice what brother branham he comes all the way down from christ the mystery of god revealed he preaches preaches three hours and 57 minutes i count that as four hours in my book he comes and he preaches a four-hour message on christ the mystery of god revealed yeah listen to it go listen to it i listen that thing over a hundred sometimes and every time i get something new but you come down all the way to the end of paragraph 6 37 and you see brother brandon he starts singing a song he said now if you're if you're if you're spiritual he said if you're spiritual you catch these things he said he said now look he said the clock is at two o'clock right on the dot he said showing that the second pool has been manifested it's time for the third pole to come into view and he starts singing that song that he's singing about jesus coming down and jesus is is the great high priest and he said now notice he said the third pull is at hand and he starts singing that song and he said did you watch what he just did when the angel got into the worship he took the praise to a higher octave showing that the third pole was at hand let me say this to you you're not a second pool people you're a third pool people you're the opening of the word and you stand here you stand here as the bride of jesus christ with the opening word the king sword in your hand don't you try to produce it the third war the third pole will produce exactly what it is it'll produce christ it'll produce sons ahead of right it'll produce squirrels but more than that it'll produce real sons and daughters of god it'll manifest exactly what it is ah let me let me give you this notice hold on devil about to get real i'm a bad driver when it comes to dealing with the devil i'll wreck him don't mess with me when i'm playing bumper cars i take things serious i got it from my mama she'll go awol on you we pick out somebody we're going to hit we tear them apart they say man what did i do did i look at them wrong and everybody in the whole family is going after this one person well get your bumper car with me this morning come on get in your bumper car with me as more let's let's bump this devil right on out the door we are the family of the most high god let's bump him right out of your life let's bump him out of this place let's bump him out of your spirit let's bump him out of your mind devil you have stayed here too long you have stayed attacking my family too long you have tried to rob me too long now's your time your time is over but my time is at hand hallelujah what's cancer notice angels appear in the end time all the prophets in a signpost point saying this day that angels will appear prophets will arise and signs and wonders and if god did that for those little junctions back there what will he do now when all hell is turned loose if all those signs if those angels came back there at those little junctions what will he do right now when all hell is turned loose he said all heaven will turn loose angels appearing signs and wonders on the earth and counterfeits arising but god is proven which is right and which is wrong angels have appeared all hell has tried to enlarge itself and tried to swallow you up but all of heaven has turned loose on you whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven oh god may the holy ghost be loose it's time that you turn him loose in your body it's time that you start speaking to your body and you must start making your body obey your confession mind battles it's time for you to learn it's time for you to leave i'm turning heaven loose on this [Applause] i'm turning heaven loose on our prodigals i'm turning heaven loose on this knee i'm turned heaven loose on this church time is at hand notice when it come time for moses time to arise god wouldn't lift a finger he didn't lift a finger because all those rabbis down there thought that the days of miracles were gone by they thought that that that god had done went out of the existence and he didn't do those things no more brother donny but he wouldn't even lift a finger until out of that humble little tribe of levi there came one by the name of moses and what did he do he went down there and showed that he met an angel and he started producing signs and he started producing the miraculous because the time of their deliverance was a hand this is this is powerful right here brother brown said now he said they had joseph's bones they had something that joseph had in a revelation don't you lay don't you leave my bones down here when you leave because we are promised that we're going to leave he said now he said they had joseph's bones down there and he said that was all right he said but they needed a fresh scene of god you've been sitting here and you you've been you've been wondering when when will it be my time i i've seen it work i've seen it look for a little i worked for a little isaac that there was a promise there was a promise and then there came a fulfillment i've seen it work for brother ron i've seen it work for these others i've seen it work for william brown i've seen it work for hattie right i've seen it work for brother denny i seen it work what about my time the angels are here they are appearing and the omnipotence has got to be produced he is the one that produces the miraculous what happened over there in john chapter 5 when there come a certain time in a certain season become a troubling of the water it was not the water it was the angel that was on the water the effects that you're feeling is not humanity it's divinity and you watch as you begin to enter into that realm and we realize that there's voices that are flowing through here this morning you don't see them you don't hear them but there's an instrument by by the name of a radio that you can pull up or you can tap into your phone and there's voices that are floating all around here but it takes somebody with an instrument to tap into that channel now faith is your tapping into the channel and if you tap into the channel you'll hear that he is still the omnipotent one the all-powerful and if you begin to tap into that voice he will say i am speaking to you in this last day by my son and i am saying these things if you go to watching what will happen when you go to tapping into that channel it'll bring down something to your body and it'll prove to that that it was your time to receive your miracle blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord the time is at hand isn't that right we're in the greatest dispensation that's ever hit the earth and this is him this is him that's doing this work who will it be who will it be that heals ron spencer who will it be that produces a baby who will it be that gives strength to the weak who will it be who will it be that'll give life to wesley so he can walk who will it be that'll go and hunt down that'll hunt down our lost who will it be that'll go where it seems like it's impossible to go but god will have some humanity god will have some humanity and a predestinated spot to step in and say this is your time this is your moment what was it that worked on that little lady she says well i see she's got a prayer card in her hand i don't need to go pray for her but god dropped on her heart go pray for that woman give her your seat what was he working through humanity which he went through that line she said but the prophet looked at her said well that that thing's already taken care of that little lady up there in that balcony the lord did the work while you was up there in that little balcony you've been waiting for me to do something over top of you but it's already been done it's been shown before your eyes this is melchizedek ain't that right this is him this is him that stood on that platform this is the same one we're not producing something that that we're trying to work up in our own human emotion and try to elaborate and try to make ourselves something this is the lord jesus christ last weekend i was told i was told because i was in another world but i was told that there was there was like a tongue and interpretation that went forth from the audience you can take this you can take this however you want to but i know what was happening and these young people can identify but they were to me i didn't know what was happening but i went back and what people referred to me and told me you remember when brother branham would talk about those how they would talk over there in the foreign country with those clicks and those clacks how that they would make certain word they they use the language like they click last weekend i i don't know if you watched it or not but you could you can hear it on the streaming but there began began to be a word that came forth and the word was going forth under an element of time and showing that heaven had come down and the word said hey hey hey hey i am here i am here listen unto my servant who was that speaking of me absolutely not it was speaking of him and then you watch the work of the servant you watch them as they begin to work but notice you can get offended at this or however you want to take it maybe i shouldn't say it i'll just say it in this way but god had used this this this sister and said i can't use you i miss you open your mouth i don't want to offend you i don't want to offend you in any way so i'll just say it like that god can't use your mouth unless you open it god can't oh god can't you you can't you can't be used unless you be yielded and what did the prophet tell us he said the greatest gift of any man is to get himself out of the way this is not about producing carnality this is about producing christ because this third pool will only produce the elect it'll only produce christ it'll only produce proven signs and proven wonders because he's come at this time for such a certain season there was a sister one time that was dealing with an issue and she said i wondered when is my time when is my time and he said right now is your time you remember when he was over there across seas brother brandon was across these there and those james and the sikhs and they they had they he he said entertained him all day long he said sirs of the religions of the world you've had your time he said but now it's his time and you watch what he did during that time it's an angel it's an angel at work it's an angel that's producing these things it was an angel that woke up the prodigal david wondered when shall i go when shall i go these philistines have have hurt my family these these devils have come in surrounded us and the word said wait here wait right here but when you hear the sound of a going brother brown said to me here he was laying under those mulberry trees he was laying there all of a sudden there came a wind it was an angels that was rustling up that mulberry trees he said now's your time to go and pursue oh yeah david bestow yourself you've been waiting for an answer when it's your time to get up and when it's your time to fight back david it's your time david it's your time to rise to the challenge brother william shared share with me a quote last evening he said he said when when that when he would go through a dry parts time and there's a season of a dry parts time he said he said but when you again brother began to say in the whole armor of christ he said but he said but when you begin to see when noah knew that the promise was coming he said he could feel the wind coming he could feel the wind coming and showing that it was about to come that wind has been blowing just like it was blowing in the oneness of unity and it sounded off a voice but now's your time to go and pursue and take back now is your time you you don't need me to say something over top of you you don't need me to speak to you you know where it's at and he said after last weekend he turned and said if you fail to believe now you'll never make the rapture is that right brother jordan church if we fail to believe right now in the greatest of all times when he has shown himself amongst you like never before who was that who was that sister julia i said you'll pass that test that was him that was him but god would take the same the same word he would take the same word and there was a sister down in tennessee that was praying the same thing over her son that he would pass this board or pass this test and god took one word and produced the same miracle and god has taken this same word and he's producing a body change in a people it's one voice it's one sound it's the lord jesus christ that is developing and producing this miracle you have been drawing on him [Applause] brother doug you were in a meeting you were in a meeting when the devil was devil was warring in this service and you were sitting about right there and all of a sudden it looked like it was your time i remember i i i remember looking i it looked like it was your time but god said it wasn't your time i still got more for you brother doug i still got a holy ghost that'll birth you and make you new like never before make you realize that he's still the same yesterday today and forever he'll produce the same work the same one that said you're not finished yet it's saying you're not finished yet he's telling you that this is for you full gospel lighthouse your time's not over you're just beginning it's a time for the bride of jesus christ to raise to our feet that's what the devil is howling about is because it is being identified in a body of jesus christ identified believers identified
