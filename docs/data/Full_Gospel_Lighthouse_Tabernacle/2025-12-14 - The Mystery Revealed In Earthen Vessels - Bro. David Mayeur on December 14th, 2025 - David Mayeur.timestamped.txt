[16:50] impossible.
[16:54] We'll see a miracle.
[16:58] Oh God, we believe.
[17:02] And God we believe for it.
[17:09] Well, you said it
[17:13] and I believe it.
[17:18] Well, you said it
[17:23] and it is done
[17:26] over my life. You said it
[17:32] and I believe it.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Well, you said it.
[17:41] And he's done every promise
[17:45] you say.
[17:49] So I believe it
[17:54] in every circumstance.
[17:57] I believe what you said to me.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You said cancer can leave
[18:03] for you said it. He said our prodicals

[18:57] &gt;&gt; One thing. Do you know what that means?
[19:00] There's one thing. You know what it is?
[19:04] He cannot fail.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; So God is obligated to back up his
[19:10] bloodbound promises.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; So no matter what it is, if Jesus said
[19:15] it, then I believe it.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; And there is nothing that can move a
[19:19] believer when they know who they are.

[23:47] this season that that the Lord will be
[23:49] very very near. Want to remember our
[23:51] pastor, brother Ron, um fighting cancer
[23:55] and then kidney issues and different
[23:57] things there in his body. Needs a real
[23:58] touch from the Lord. Also, Sister
[24:00] Terresa Delaney, Brother Jeff Breeden,
[24:02] Sister Wanda Hinkle, all the elderly
[24:04] here at the church. Thankful to have
[24:06] brother Matthew back in the house of the
[24:08] Lord.
[24:16] I got a note while we were serving the
[24:18] Lord last night just worshiping the Lord
[24:20] and he said he said, "Wow, wow, wow,
[24:22] what a service." And he said, "I danced
[24:25] all I could around this house." And so
[24:28] if you knew where he was just just the
[24:30] day before, you would realize how great
[24:32] the Lord has been to him. He said it. He
[24:35] said his dogs downstairs probably
[24:36] thought they was remodeling upstairs. So
[24:39] that's all right. Amen. How many has a
[24:42] need that you'd like to make known to
[24:43] the Lord today? Amen. I'm invite brother
[24:46] William to come take these needs before
[24:47] the Lord. Brother William prays you pray
[24:49] with him today. God bless you.
[24:53] Amen. Let's bow our heads in our heart.
[24:55] Dear gracious heavenly father, we come
[24:57] before you in prayer, Lord. We just want
[24:59] to Lord magnify your name in this place
[25:01] this morning. Lord, we want to thank you
[25:03] for all your blessings on our lives,
[25:05] Lord, and all the things that you give
[25:07] us, Lord, and how good you are to us,
[25:09] Lord. Truly, you've been better to us
[25:11] than we could be to ourselves, Lord. We
[25:12] just want to thank you, Lord, as we're
[25:14] just in this season of Christmas,
[25:16] Father. Lord, we just want to thank you,
[25:17] Father, that Lord, you refuse to be
[25:20] separated from us, Lord. When when the
[25:22] choices of humanity, Lord, separated us
[25:25] from you, you would not allow us to be,
[25:27] Lord. You had attributes in you as we
[25:29] heard last night. You came looking for
[25:32] us, Lord. And Lord, you didn't just step
[25:34] in, Father, Lord, just a grown body. But
[25:36] Lord, you came as a baby so you could
[25:39] experience every part of life. Lord, you
[25:42] came in a human body that Lord, you are
[25:44] the perfect son of God. And you are God
[25:46] in flesh. But Lord, in the frailty of
[25:49] that flesh, you still groan with a
[25:50] headache and you still experience
[25:52] rejection and you still experience all
[25:54] the things of life that we go through.
[25:56] so that you would know what it feels
[25:58] like. And Lord, you allowed yourself to
[26:00] fall into the hands of sinful men to be
[26:03] crucified. And Satan thought that he had
[26:05] you. But Lord, it was the greatest
[26:07] victory, Lord God, that humanity has
[26:09] ever seen when you gave your life, Lord,
[26:12] and the sin question was settled
[26:13] forever. And then they buried you and
[26:16] Satan surely thought it was over then.
[26:18] Father, within three days, oh God, you
[26:20] resurrected and made that beautiful
[26:22] statement that all power in heaven and
[26:24] earth belongs to you. And oh God, we
[26:26] come in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:28] Christ this morning. We give you all
[26:31] exaltation and all the praise that we
[26:33] could possibly give you. Lord, we come
[26:36] and our hearts is so overflowing with
[26:38] thanksgiving for a word that you've
[26:40] provided for us, oh God, where the faith
[26:42] that you've given us in this end time
[26:44] despite the challenges of life, despite
[26:46] the things that we go through. Lord, we
[26:48] want to make a confession to you this
[26:50] morning that we believe you, Father.
[26:53] Lord, we just pray that you elevate our
[26:54] faith, Lord. There's so many promises in
[26:56] your word. elevate our faith, Lord, that
[26:59] we can hold on and believe and watch it
[27:01] come to pass because your word truly
[27:04] never fails. Lord, we pray over every
[27:06] request that was read. Lord, we just
[27:08] pray that you go to each and every one,
[27:09] Lord, all the ones in the hospitals,
[27:11] Lord, and fighting cancers, Lord, those
[27:13] that are will be in surgery this week.
[27:15] We just pray that your hand be upon
[27:17] them, Father. Lord, we thank you for
[27:19] what you did for brother Matthew. We
[27:20] just pray that you just continue to give
[27:22] the doctors wisdom as they treat them.
[27:24] Father, me, you completely restore us
[27:26] back, Lord. May his testimony even be
[27:29] that it was better than before. We just
[27:31] thank you, Father, and we believe you
[27:32] for this, Lord. And we just lift up
[27:34] Brother Ron. Pray that you bless him,
[27:36] Lord. And despite the doctor's reports,
[27:38] we have another report, and that's what
[27:40] we're looking to. We're standing in
[27:42] faith, and that's how we're proving our
[27:44] faith to you is we're confessing your
[27:46] word and we're standing on it. Lord, we
[27:49] just pray for the Sailor family even
[27:50] now, Brother Roger. Lord, despite of
[27:53] where we are in health or in sickness,
[27:54] we still depend upon you for every
[27:57] breath. I just pray, oh God, that you
[27:59] just go to him, Lord, and just comfort
[28:01] him as sister and Lord, in the family.
[28:04] Lord, you've been so good to him, Lord.
[28:06] And Father God, you never fail. We just
[28:08] love you. We commit the rest of these
[28:09] requests unto you even now. We commit
[28:11] the service into your hands and pray
[28:13] that you bless Brother David. Bless them
[28:15] as he delivers the word. May you anoint
[28:16] them. Bless the word to our hearts as
[28:18] you do so many times. We love you. We
[28:21] thank you in Jesus Christ's name we
[28:22] pray. Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; This time we'll take up the morning's
[28:29] offering. As they're as you give, you
[28:32] can be seated today. We'll invite Sister
[28:34] Emma to come bring her special and then

[31:49] waited for?

[31:58] their thrones? How many lords have
[32:02] abandoned their homes?
[32:04] How many great have become the least for
[32:09] me?
[32:11] And how many gods have poured out their
[32:15] hearts to romance a world that is torn
[32:19] all apart.
[32:21] How many fathers gave up their sons for
[32:26] me?
[32:31] Bringing our gifts for the newborn
[32:34] savior. All that we have rather costly
[32:39] or make because we believe.
[32:45] Gold for his honor and frankincense for
[32:50] his pleasure and my for the cross he
[32:53] will suffer. Do you believe? Is this who
[32:58] we've waited for?
[33:05] How many kings step down from their thy
[33:11] lords have abandoned their homes? How
[33:15] many great have become the least for me?
[33:24] And how many gods have poured out their
[33:28] hearts to romance a world that is torn
[33:32] all apart?
[33:34] How many fathers gave up their sons for
[33:39] me?
[33:42] Only one did die for me.
[33:48] Oh,
[33:52] only one did die for me.
[34:08] Offer me.
[34:12] All for you.
[34:17] offer me.
[34:23] How many kings step down from their
[34:26] thrones? How many lords have in their
[34:31] homes? How many great have become the
[34:36] least for me?
[34:42] How many gods have poured out their
[34:46] hearts to romance a world that is torn
[34:50] all apart?
[34:52] How many fathers gave up their sons for
[34:57] me?
[35:00] Only one did that for me.
[35:09] Only one did that for me.
[35:41] Well, I remember
[35:46] when I danced at the altar.
[35:51] I didn't care if it cost me a friend or
[35:56] two.
[36:00] I remember
[36:05] getting baptized in cold water.
[36:10] You're rising with a fire
[36:14] in my soul.
[36:19] Same power
[36:22] now and forever.
[36:25] You're not through. Say words and speak
[36:33] to a mountain and make men move. Oh, I
[36:40] know the God of the old is the God of
[36:47] the new.
[36:49] I know that you did it.
[36:54] You still do. You still do.
[37:02] Do you remember
[37:09] the roar of a choir
[37:13] as they praise him for hours and he
[37:18] filled the room?
[37:22] Oh, I remember
[37:28] when they told us he had cancer
[37:33] and we did have the answers
[37:37] where there's three or two.
[37:41] It's the same power
[37:46] now and forever. Oh, you're not through.
[37:52] Same words can speak to mountain and
[37:58] make them move. And I know the God of
[38:06] behold is the God of the new. I know
[38:14] that you did it then and you still do.
[38:21] You're still mighty and strong, faithful
[38:25] and true. You'll make a way. That's just
[38:30] what you do. You're the breaker of
[38:33] chains, beginning and end.
[38:37] I've seen it over and over. The same
[38:43] power
[38:45] now and forever. No, you're not through.
[38:51] Same words can speak to mountain
[39:00] move. Oh, I know the God of the old is
[39:06] the God of the new. I know that you did
[39:15] it then and you still do the same power
[39:24] now and forever. No, you're not.
[39:30] Say words can speak to the mountains and
[39:36] make them move. Oh, I know the God of
[39:44] the old is the God of the moon. I know
[39:52] that you did then you still do. Stay
[40:01] true.
[40:12] And let's stand this morning. Let's get
[40:14] ready to invite our brother David to
[40:15] come bring the word of life. Can you

[44:25] working.
[44:27] Even when I don't see it, you're
[44:30] working.
[44:31] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[44:34] working.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to say that to your emotions.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; And even when you don't see it,
[44:48] &gt;&gt; say that to your feelings.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; Say that to everything out there that
[44:55] tries to say that God is contrary to his
[44:57] word.
[45:01] Let the devil know whether you see it or
[45:03] not.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; He just asked us to believe his word.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; And if you'll believe it, he'll
[45:18] accomplish it.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Even when I don't see it, you're

[45:25] Even when I don't feel it, you're
[45:28] working. You never stop. You never stop

[46:40] My God,
[46:41] that is who are
[46:45] maker. As brother David comes,
[46:48] &gt;&gt; way maker,
[46:53] promise keeper, light in the darkness,
[46:58] my God. That is who you are.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, that is who you are.
[47:07] The way maker, miracle worker, promise
[47:12] keeper, light in the darkness.
[47:16] My God
[47:18] that is you are.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Is that personally for you? Is he your
[47:25] way maker?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Can you testify it once more this
[47:29] morning and say you are my way maker.
[47:32] When there is no way, he will make a
[47:34] way.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; You are a promisekeeper.
[47:38] That is who you are. That is who I want
[47:41] to praise.
[47:43] You're my way maker. You're a miracle
[47:46] worker.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Is anything too hard this morning,
[47:49] saints?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; He's worthy of all our praise.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. In a in such a time as this,
[47:56] where the presence of the Lord is,
[48:00] everything is possible.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:06] Can we sing that one more time with all
[48:08] our hearts
[48:11] in your situation that you're dealing
[48:12] with this morning?
[48:14] this night.
[48:18] But he's a way maker.
[48:20] He's a way maker.
[48:23] Oh, way maker, miracle work, promise
[48:29] keeper, light in the darkness.
[48:33] My God, that is who you are.
[48:42] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[48:47] keeper, light in the darkness.
[48:51] Our God,
[48:54] that is who you are.
[48:58] Can we give him a hand of praise?
[49:02] Hallelujah.
[49:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:09] Hallelujah.
[49:12] That is who you are,
[49:14] my Lord and Savior. Well, good morning
[49:17] saints.
[49:19] Amen. I would have loved brother Andrew
[49:22] to continue singing
[49:24] &gt;&gt; because you know there's something about
[49:26] worship.
[49:29] There's something about worship. You
[49:31] know the brother the prophet talks how
[49:34] the two spirits spirit of God the
[49:37] antichrist spirit are working in the
[49:39] framework of the church because Satan
[49:41] wants to get the glory out of the
[49:43] church.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; He wants to be praised
[49:48] because he wants to take the place of
[49:50] God.
[49:51] But we are made to worship him.
[49:54] And there's something about true
[49:56] worshippers where Christ, he said,
[49:58] "These are the ones that I'm looking
[50:00] for."
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That are worshiping me in spirit and in
[50:06] truth.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And God has given us the truth, the
[50:10] revealed word. And when a seed of God
[50:13] sees his name in the book, Amen. And
[50:16] from his heart, not just
[50:18] &gt;&gt; making a noise, the Bible says make a
[50:21] joyful noise. Amen.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And there's quite a difference between
[50:25] just a noise and a joyful noise. Cuz
[50:27] when it comes from your heart, there's
[50:29] so much joy. There's so much
[50:30] thanksgiving. There's so much that comes
[50:32] from your heart.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God loves worship.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When they went into battle, Amen.
[50:39] And I love the testimonies that I hear.
[50:42] Amen. When they went into battle, who
[50:45] did they put in the front? Worshippers.
[50:50] So brothers in the front row
[50:54] &gt;&gt; now that goes for the back row too
[50:57] &gt;&gt; cuz we're worshippers
[51:01] &gt;&gt; and when we start running around the
[51:03] prophet says I've nothing never seen
[51:05] anything out of order
[51:07] &gt;&gt; cuz when the spirit of the Lord is
[51:09] moving.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So yeah I can have a victory
[51:12] dance. Amen. I can walk around the walls
[51:15] of Jericho. Amen. And I know those walls
[51:18] will become crumbling down.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. People are are shy, afraid or say
[51:24] it's my character or this that and the
[51:26] other. No. No. Amen. Anybody here?
[51:30] Everybody here has emotions.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Let me look at you.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody who hasn't emotions?
[51:40] Come forward, please.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[51:47] Because everybody has emotions and God,
[51:49] he knows how to deal with our heart
[51:52] &gt;&gt; where something comes out through
[51:54] worship. Thank you, Jesus.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Let the worshippers arise this morning.
[51:59] The true worshippers arise. You know the
[52:01] prophet, he talks, Amen, that Christmas
[52:04] and and we don't want to put it just at
[52:06] a date, at a period. Christmas is all
[52:09] year.
[52:12] That's not a new doctrine.
[52:14] You know, I know the kids, they will
[52:16] come, dad, it's Christmas every day. No,
[52:22] but Christmas, the prophet says, is a
[52:25] time of worship.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; That's why I said Christmas should be
[52:29] every every day because he's worthy of
[52:31] our praise and our glory.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says, "The first
[52:35] time angels ever sang at a celebration,
[52:38] it was in heaven."
[52:41] Come on now.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; We know the angels came down and they
[52:44] were worshiped. They were singing,
[52:46] bringing good news, good tidings. The
[52:48] prophet says the first time angels ever
[52:49] sang at a celebration was in heaven. You
[52:52] can look it up in Job 38. We'll come
[52:54] back to that in a few seconds. Amen. And
[52:56] he said, so God asked him, Job, where
[52:59] were you before I laid the foundation of
[53:02] the earth? When the morning stars sang
[53:05] together and the star the sons of God
[53:07] shouted for joy, where were you then,
[53:10] Job? You see, first time angels ever
[53:14] sang at a celebration was in heaven. And
[53:16] the first time they ever sang on earth
[53:18] was the shepherds to the shepherds at
[53:20] the birth of God. So God loves worship.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Some people are afraid of worship. You
[53:28] know why they're afraid?
[53:30] Because when you truly worship God
[53:34] in your deepest trial, we can name all
[53:37] of them in the Bible. Amen. When you
[53:40] start worshiping for the victory, maybe
[53:43] you don't see it yet, maybe you don't
[53:44] feel it yet, but by faith,
[53:47] &gt;&gt; you worship the one who holds
[53:49] everything.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Something supernatural happens
[53:53] that maybe your eyes don't see, but that
[53:56] is a reality.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] Amen. I was preaching if I don't know if
[54:02] it was last Sunday or the Sunday before
[54:03] in the church. Amen. That the Hebrew
[54:06] boys, they were in in in fire.
[54:11] Fire is alive.
[54:14] God's fire is alive.
[54:16] But the power of God was there and the
[54:18] power was sufficient. Amen. And he is my
[54:22] all sufficient. He is my all and all.
[54:26] And the power of God was sufficient. You
[54:28] know what? For
[54:30] to even stop the smell
[54:35] &gt;&gt; of the fire go in their clothing.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; You want to talk about power?
[54:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother David, that's just the
[54:43] detail. No, it ain't the detail.
[54:46] God does everything well.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; The little things, the big things, he
[54:52] does all things well.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So the Hallelujah. He's
[54:56] worthy of our praise and we should never
[54:58] says the prophet. Amen. Let the spirit
[55:01] of revival die.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; I would like to have a 100% of amens
[55:08] there.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. If brother Matt back home while
[55:14] the spirit of God is moving, Amen. can
[55:16] have his victory dance.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; What about us? Amen. I've been in many
[55:21] meetings. Amen. people I am not go I'm
[55:24] not preaching now for streaming careful
[55:26] your place is at church that's what the
[55:28] word says
[55:30] &gt;&gt; but if for any situation yeah I am not
[55:32] going there now but I've been in
[55:35] meetings preaching meetings and other
[55:37] countries are streaming in and people
[55:41] the same anointing that is here in the
[55:43] building is there where the church in a
[55:47] home in a car
[55:49] &gt;&gt; amen people receiving their deliverance
[55:52] their healing, the baptism of the Holy
[55:54] Ghost. We serve a living God.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; So, we should never let that Amen. the
[56:02] the spirit of revival
[56:05] die.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; Prophet says we've got to keep in
[56:09] revival, constantly revived
[56:15] every day because Paul said he had to
[56:17] die daily to Christ so that Christ could
[56:21] live. And we must never let that revival
[56:23] die. So saints of God, never let the
[56:28] revival die.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; So this morning once again, I'm going to
[56:33] ask you preach with me, please.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. So thank you very much. It's a
[56:38] great honor before we go into the word.
[56:41] Again, a privilege and honor to be
[56:42] standing here before the redeemed of the
[56:44] Lord. Amen. and thank you for
[56:47] everything. Your love, your hospitality.
[56:51] Amen. You are a blessing.
[56:54] Yes.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; This is a lighthouse. It's not just a
[56:58] name.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe you don't realize, maybe many of
[57:02] you here have never crossed the ocean,
[57:06] been to Europe, been to another country.
[57:09] many saints. You will meet them on the
[57:11] other side and say what a blessing the
[57:14] church has been, the ministry has been.
[57:17] So again, thank you for sharing. Thank
[57:19] you for sharing
[57:21] Ron Brother Andrew the ministry. Amen.
[57:24] So it is a blessing and and and hereby I
[57:27] invite you Lord willing we are going to
[57:30] have Easter meetings in 2026 in
[57:33] Switzerland. So you are all invited.
[57:35] Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; All are welcome.
[57:41] Taste and see how the Lord is good.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So, and we will have the privilege of
[57:47] having brother Ron. He confirmed. Amen.
[57:50] He's one of the speakers. So, we
[57:52] definitely want to keep Brother Ron in
[57:53] prayer. Amen. And thank you once again.
[57:57] So
[57:59] yes, we know we will need eternity
[58:03] together to talk about the goodness of
[58:05] God. How in every situation, Amen.
[58:08] Sometimes you go somewhere, you say,
[58:10] "Well, you preach this and the word of
[58:12] God just changed my life." Well, glory
[58:14] be to God. That's why we preach the
[58:17] word. So lives are changed. Amen. So,
[58:21] why don't we take our Bibles, go to the
[58:23] word of God, and
[58:26] thank you musicians.
[58:32] Thank you, brother Andrew, Sister Katie,
[58:34] for all you've done for us. My wife and
[58:37] Jessica, my daughter, we love you
[58:39] dearly. Brother Ron, sister Connie,
[58:44] we are family. True family.
[58:47] Amen. Let's take 2 Corinthians 4. 2
[58:50] Corinthians 4
[59:03] verse three.
[59:10] But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
[59:14] them that are lost, in whom the God of
[59:16] this world had blinded the minds of them
[59:19] which believe not, lest the light of the
[59:22] glorious gospel of Christ, who is the
[59:24] image of God should shine unto them. For
[59:28] we preach not ourselves, but Christ
[59:31] Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your
[59:33] servants for Jesus' sake. For God who
[59:36] commanded it light to shine out of
[59:38] darkness had shined in our hearts to
[59:41] give the light of the knowledge of the
[59:44] glory of God in the face of Jesus
[59:46] Christ.
[59:48] But we have this treasure
[59:51] treasure in an earthly earth and vessel
[59:56] that the excellency of the power may be
[59:59] of God and not of us.
[1:00:03] He deserves all the glory.
[1:00:07] Amen. Colossians 1
[1:00:17] verse 25. We will start off.
[1:00:21] And here Paul is saying, "Whereof I am
[1:00:23] made a minister according to the
[1:00:25] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:00:28] for you to fulfill the word of God. Even
[1:00:31] the mystery which had been hid from ages
[1:00:34] and from generations,
[1:00:36] but now is made manifest to his saints.
[1:00:42] To whom God would made known what is the
[1:00:45] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:00:47] amongst the Gentiles,
[1:00:50] which is Christ in you, the hope of
[1:00:54] glory.
[1:00:56] So that's a mystery hid through
[1:00:59] generation, through ages, but now
[1:01:03] revealed
[1:01:06] to us.
[1:01:10] Going to look on that this morning.
[1:01:14] One more scripture in Romans 8. Sorry,
[1:01:16] we have two more scriptures. Romans 8.
[1:01:26] And here again
[1:01:30] he's saying for you have not received
[1:01:33] the spirit of bondage
[1:01:36] again to fear but you have received the
[1:01:38] spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba
[1:01:40] father the spirit itself beareth witness
[1:01:44] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:01:46] of God and if children then heirs heirs
[1:01:49] of God and joint hes with Christ, if so
[1:01:52] be that we suffer with him, that we may
[1:01:54] be also glorified together. For I reckon
[1:01:58] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:02:01] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:02:04] glory which shall be revealed
[1:02:08] in us.
[1:02:11] My when I read these the these verses,
[1:02:14] Amen. There's something in my heart
[1:02:16] because God has a plan for us. Amen. I
[1:02:19] had a privilege of of I don't want to
[1:02:21] keep you standing too long, but Amen. I
[1:02:23] had a privilege of visiting Rome and and
[1:02:25] and and I went to the the prison where
[1:02:27] where Paul was imprisoned and where he
[1:02:30] wrote. I mean, it wasn't a five-star
[1:02:33] hotel.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; There was a little opening just there
[1:02:37] where they could feed him
[1:02:41] and there was nothing else. Sometimes
[1:02:43] they even tell a story when it was
[1:02:45] pouring down rain. The water was just
[1:02:47] coming out out of the the the ground and
[1:02:50] and so there was only stone rock
[1:02:52] everywhere.
[1:02:55] And here we read the the these verses
[1:02:59] that were pinned down
[1:03:01] anointed by God. God anointing a man.
[1:03:05] Amen. Where even Amen. Paul, he had to
[1:03:08] use a big character.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet says. Huh?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we read those verses and
[1:03:17] we Oh, we know them. We know them.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; While God was anointing the man of God,
[1:03:24] it was for our purpose. It was for us.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; That's why when I read the word of God,
[1:03:31] Amen. I reckon that the sufferings of
[1:03:34] this present time, he was suffering.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; He was suffering. He didn't have a fancy
[1:03:41] bed. Nice and cozy. And and I've seen it
[1:03:44] a rock. Try to sleep on that rock.
[1:03:49] Water coming out.
[1:03:53] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:03:55] present time are worthy to be compared
[1:03:57] with the glory which shall be revealed
[1:03:59] in us. My
[1:04:02] we can be thankful saints.
[1:04:05] One more scripture. Second Timothy 2.
[1:04:09] Verse
[1:04:17] 19.
[1:04:19] Nevertheless, the foundation of God
[1:04:21] standed sure. Having this seal, the Lord
[1:04:24] knoweth them that are his.
[1:04:28] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:30] He will not lose a single one.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; We limit. We have limits. God is
[1:04:40] unlimited.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Where we stop, his grace goes way
[1:04:46] beyond.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Having this
[1:04:51] seal, the Lord knoweth them that are
[1:04:52] his, and let everyone that nameth the
[1:04:55] name of Christ depart from iniquity. But
[1:04:57] in a great house, there are not only
[1:04:59] vessels of gold and of silver, but also
[1:05:02] of wood and of earth, and some to honor,
[1:05:05] and some to dishonor. If a man therefore
[1:05:08] purge himself from these, he shall be a
[1:05:10] vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meat
[1:05:13] for the master's use, and prepared unto
[1:05:16] every good work. May God add the
[1:05:19] blessing to the reading of his word.
[1:05:21] Let's bow our heads for the word of
[1:05:23] prayer.
[1:05:25] Our precious heavenly father, once
[1:05:28] again, Lord God, we want to thank you
[1:05:30] from the depths of our hearts.
[1:05:32] Father, you that brought us together
[1:05:34] here.
[1:05:36] And Lord God, we are united not to see
[1:05:41] a man. We are united here in the name of
[1:05:45] Jesus. Because Lord, we want to have an
[1:05:47] opp another meeting with you, another
[1:05:50] conference with you, Lord, where you
[1:05:52] speak to each and every individual,
[1:05:56] Father, and where you make yourself even
[1:05:58] more real. So, Father, we've read those
[1:06:01] verses. You are the author. And we pray
[1:06:04] now, Father, may you come down and
[1:06:07] reveal, break the bread of life to each
[1:06:10] and everyone.
[1:06:12] May you anoint our ears, Father, so that
[1:06:14] we can hear your voice speaking to us.
[1:06:18] And as I hide behind the cross, I pray,
[1:06:20] may you take full control over me,
[1:06:23] Father, to preach your word, Lord God.
[1:06:26] And may it change lives, Lord. May
[1:06:28] people receive their blessing even as we
[1:06:31] speak the word. Father Lord, bless those
[1:06:34] that those that are here. Bless those
[1:06:36] that are streaming. Father, we want to
[1:06:39] surrender to you and we want to give you
[1:06:41] all the glory. We ask these things in
[1:06:43] the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[1:06:45] Christ. And the church says,
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; "Amen and amen." You may be seated.
[1:06:51] Thank you, brother Andrew.
[1:06:56] Amen. So
[1:07:00] as a title this morning, I'd like to
[1:07:03] take the mystery
[1:07:06] revealed in vessel.
[1:07:11] Amen. So we read about how the mystery
[1:07:14] is revealed. Amen. And we're going to
[1:07:16] look at why God came in our generation,
[1:07:20] in our season, in our time to reveal
[1:07:24] that was hid through all the ages.
[1:07:26] That's why we can only but repeat it. We
[1:07:30] ought to be the happiest people in the
[1:07:33] earth.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Theologians,
[1:07:39] Amen. Many people have tried to
[1:07:42] understand the depths of the word and
[1:07:45] they are a thousand miles away from the
[1:07:49] truth.
[1:07:50] And here a simple me, amen, can read the
[1:07:55] word of God and read the message and and
[1:07:58] see who I am.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; What it's all about, what is going on
[1:08:04] here.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet talks about how me
[1:08:08] people can read the Bible. Amen. And
[1:08:11] they they hear or read about the king of
[1:08:13] the north or they Amen. Revelation.
[1:08:15] Revelation. They scratch their head and
[1:08:18] and and there's a beast and there's
[1:08:20] powers and things like that. And here
[1:08:22] simple me can read the word of God.
[1:08:26] Amen. And a vindicated prophet coming in
[1:08:29] our generation to reveal the plan of God
[1:08:33] for us.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And it couldn't have happened in another
[1:08:36] age. It couldn't have happened in the in
[1:08:39] the in the first age, second. No, it had
[1:08:41] to be at our time.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. How we know that Israel is God's
[1:08:47] time piece. Amen. That Israel is back in
[1:08:50] his homeland. Amen. So, we see all these
[1:08:53] nations having their eyes on this little
[1:08:56] tiny little country because God what he
[1:08:59] says in his word. Amen. He said it. He's
[1:09:02] not going to take it back. He's not
[1:09:04] going to change it.
[1:09:06] So don't take it accountable on us if
[1:09:10] preachers preach the word and it doesn't
[1:09:12] fit or suit what you want to hear.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; We're not here to have a social gospel.
[1:09:20] We are here to prepare a bride. We are
[1:09:23] here to be rapture ready.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. The time of playing is over.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; There will be a time where we won't be
[1:09:33] able to come anymore. Amen.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You want me to remind you and often I've
[1:09:38] quoted it and even to my own church I
[1:09:40] say it co came everything was stopped.
[1:09:45] I've heard so many people say you know
[1:09:47] we couldn't come to church and we'll
[1:09:50] never be the same.
[1:09:54] co goes
[1:09:56] and yes the first week comes oh yeah
[1:09:58] yeah we're so happy and little by little
[1:10:01] we should never let the fire the revival
[1:10:06] die
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; amen and we have a part to play in that
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; as the minister surrenders as the
[1:10:14] ministers lays before God seeks the will
[1:10:17] of the Lord what to preach amen the food
[1:10:20] in due season amen we have a part to
[1:10:24] Amen. To to receive the word with our
[1:10:27] worship. Amen. And to keep the fire
[1:10:30] burning.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Give me oil in my lamb. Keep me burning.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Give me oil in my lamb. I pray.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Why? We still can.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So we see God. He
[1:10:49] wrote, Amen. three Bibles.
[1:10:53] First one was in the heaven. Second one
[1:10:55] was in the pyramid. The third one is on
[1:10:56] earth. And everyone of them agree with
[1:10:59] one another.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So we're not going into different
[1:11:04] versions. No,
[1:11:06] there's not father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:11:09] There's one God. His name is the Lord
[1:11:11] Jesus Christ.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Watch. What does the zodiac start
[1:11:15] off with? The virgin. What does it end
[1:11:17] with? Leo the lion. the first coming and
[1:11:20] the second coming of Christ. Amen. Then
[1:11:22] he continues. He says in blasphemous
[1:11:24] names. Notice God wrote three Bibles.
[1:11:28] The first Bible was in the sky. He
[1:11:29] repeats the zodiac. Now you know the
[1:11:32] book of Job. Amen. If you don't know the
[1:11:34] book of Job, just forget about it
[1:11:36] because Job is the one explains it. How
[1:11:40] that he looked up and he named those
[1:11:44] things in the sky. So I want to take a
[1:11:47] little moment
[1:11:49] this morning before we go. Amen. To to
[1:11:52] Revelation now. Amen. But Job he writes
[1:11:56] he pins down certain verses that can
[1:11:59] sound well that's
[1:12:01] you know it's not not some some class or
[1:12:03] some but God knows what he was writing.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Job is the oldest book in the Bible.
[1:12:15] That's what the prophet says before
[1:12:17] Moses even wrote Genesis.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; So now Job 9, we see and it shows us how
[1:12:27] great God is.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; You know, so often we forget how great
[1:12:32] our God is.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; We are so focused
[1:12:37] on our issue, on our problem, on our
[1:12:39] trial.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; And Satan likes to
[1:12:45] boasts himself, makes him a big giant
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; and he's nothing but a bluff.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that this morning the
[1:12:57] weakest of the saints can have a total
[1:13:00] victory?
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; No matter how many giants are against
[1:13:05] you,
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; it's but a bluff.
[1:13:09] When the prophet tells you it's but a
[1:13:10] bluff, I love it because that's a simple
[1:13:13] word that I can understand. But do we
[1:13:16] act accordingly?
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Do we act according to what the word of
[1:13:20] God tells us? He's but a bluff.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham had his problem,
[1:13:25] Amen. Every time he ate, he he was
[1:13:27] vomiting up. And no, I'm going to keep
[1:13:29] on
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I'm going to keep on eating
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; because he's only a bluff, Satan.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:13:39] That's why here, God bless brother Matt.
[1:13:41] He heard the word and he acted upon it.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter how I feel, glory, he's
[1:13:47] worthy of my praise.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So, we see Job nine
[1:13:57] because the God that we serve is not
[1:14:01] mighty one day and then partially or
[1:14:04] very small the next day. He's almighty.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Job nine, which shaketh the earth out of
[1:14:11] her place, and the pillars thereof
[1:14:13] tremble.
[1:14:15] I love to talk about how great our God
[1:14:18] is
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; because when we speak of his greatness,
[1:14:23] our so-called big problem disappears
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; because it's about time we talk to that
[1:14:30] so-called big mountain how big our God
[1:14:32] is.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. which commanded the sun and riseth
[1:14:38] not, and sealed up the stars, which
[1:14:40] alone spreadth out the heavens, and
[1:14:42] treaded upon the ways of the sea, which
[1:14:45] make it arcturous, Orion, and the
[1:14:47] playheads, and the chambers of the
[1:14:49] south, which does great things past
[1:14:51] finding out. Yeah. And wonders without
[1:14:54] numbers.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Brother David, are you going to preach
[1:14:58] about the stars? Hey, where were thou
[1:15:01] when the morning stars shout? Sons and
[1:15:04] daughters shout its for joy.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; The playads
[1:15:11] is a conspicuous group of cl or cluster
[1:15:14] of stars in the constellation Taurus
[1:15:18] commonly spoken of as seven
[1:15:22] stars though only six are visible.
[1:15:26] That made me think because in our
[1:15:29] generation,
[1:15:31] God sent us a prophet messenger
[1:15:35] to preach the opening of the word.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; So it's not brother Brandham opening the
[1:15:41] seals. It's God himself through a
[1:15:43] vessel.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So the first seal, everybody get second
[1:15:47] seal, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
[1:15:51] then the opening of the seventh
[1:15:53] and there's silence.
[1:15:57] Six seal everybody
[1:15:59] can soal follow but the seven
[1:16:03] is for specific people.
[1:16:08] So here we see players six are visible
[1:16:12] seven
[1:16:15] it's not a public show
[1:16:22] but the bride will seize it. the bride
[1:16:25] will hear it.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Although silence, it says in the Bible
[1:16:29] for the bride, it's not a moment of
[1:16:31] silence. It's a moment of rejoicing as
[1:16:35] she receive, as he reveals his secrets
[1:16:38] to his bride.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So who created
[1:16:47] Arcturius, Orion, plays? It was God.
[1:16:51] Thousands of stars, galaxies. Amen. And
[1:16:54] the Lord, he says, "This is the work of
[1:16:56] my hand."
[1:17:00] So why are all these things in the in
[1:17:02] the sky? Have you ever ever wondered? I
[1:17:04] know some people they study, they look
[1:17:05] and they have those how how do you call
[1:17:07] those things? Telescope. Thank you. To
[1:17:10] to to see all these stars and even today
[1:17:14] they discover new ones.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; They are there to worship God.
[1:17:23] Maybe you'll look differently to the sky
[1:17:25] next time when it gets dark.
[1:17:28] So in Job, God asked Job, "Gird up now
[1:17:31] thy lines in Job 38 like a man, for I
[1:17:35] will demand of thee and answer thou me."
[1:17:39] So whoever thinks he's important, you
[1:17:42] know, God said, "Okay, I'm going to ask
[1:17:44] you a few questions here.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask you a few questions."
[1:17:48] For God, everything is simple. You know,
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; God reveals himself in simplicity. Some
[1:17:54] people want to make it mysterious. Some
[1:17:55] people want to make it very complicated.
[1:17:58] Amen. Why did the angel of the Lord love
[1:18:00] that song? Only believe because that's
[1:18:03] only it takes. Only believe the word of
[1:18:06] God and all things are possible.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, amen. Then in verse 31, can
[1:18:12] thou bind the sweet influences of
[1:18:14] playads or lose the bands of Orion? What
[1:18:18] kind of a question is that?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? What kind of a question
[1:18:22] is that? God talking to Job, his
[1:18:25] servant.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Can you do that?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Same as me asking you now. I'm going to
[1:18:32] put a little lower. And I'm not God, but
[1:18:34] can you have the victory?
[1:18:37] Can you have a revival?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Can you be sealed?
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Can you be healed?
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; We think, "Oh, that was for Job." And
[1:18:46] it's very complicated. Can thou bring
[1:18:48] forth Maserat in its season? And can
[1:18:51] thou guide Acturus with his sons?
[1:18:52] Knowest thou the ordinance of heaven?
[1:18:54] Can thou set dominion thereof in the
[1:18:56] earth?
[1:18:59] Of course I can.
[1:19:03] Can thou lift up thy voice to the clouds
[1:19:07] that abundance of waters may cover thee?
[1:19:10] Can thou send lightnings that they may
[1:19:12] go and say unto thee, here we are. Who
[1:19:15] had put wisdom in the inward parts? Oh,
[1:19:18] who had given understanding to the
[1:19:19] heart? So, can you do these things, Job?
[1:19:25] I can, but you can't. God,
[1:19:29] we lose out of Amen. of focus how big
[1:19:33] our God is.
[1:19:36] Because if we really realize, because
[1:19:38] with the opening of the word, let me ask
[1:19:41] you that question. What is the opening
[1:19:43] of the word to you?
[1:19:46] Is it just a catchy phrase?
[1:19:49] Is it just something nice to hear? Oh,
[1:19:52] the seven seals are open. I believe all
[1:19:54] the seals are open.
[1:19:57] What is it to you personally?
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's what it's about.
[1:20:04] God was just dealing with a servant
[1:20:06] saying, "Can you do this?" "No, no, I
[1:20:07] can't." He had to admit, "I can't, but
[1:20:10] you are great and worthy to be praised."
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; In Amos 5, seek him that maketh the
[1:20:17] seven stars and Orion, and turn the
[1:20:19] shadow of death into the morning, and
[1:20:21] maketh the day dark with night, that
[1:20:23] call for waters of the sea, and poured
[1:20:25] them upon the face of the earth. The
[1:20:27] Lord is his name.
[1:20:30] Amen. And he holds everything in his
[1:20:33] hands.
[1:20:37] We can read in Revelation 10. Amen. Or
[1:20:40] in Revelation, he to belongs the seven
[1:20:43] stars which are the seven messengers in
[1:20:46] the seven church ages. Amen. And he
[1:20:49] holds
[1:20:51] these stars in his hand
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; as he stands in the middle in the midst
[1:20:57] of the candlesticks holding these seven
[1:21:00] stars.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those seven messengers, he holds
[1:21:03] them. And not only them, he holds all
[1:21:06] the stars. Amen. He holds our lives in
[1:21:09] his hand.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 45 says it this way. I have made
[1:21:14] the earth and created man upon it. I
[1:21:17] even my hands have stretched out the
[1:21:19] heavens and all their host have I
[1:21:22] commanded.
[1:21:24] What a mighty God we serve.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Brother David, I knew that already.
[1:21:31] Well, you ought to be shouting the
[1:21:32] victory.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Because if I am his bride,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; that means I have the same authority.
[1:21:39] Amen. My wife has the same authority on
[1:21:42] the check that when I sign it. Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; How many are married here?
[1:21:51] There ought to be way more amens than
[1:21:53] that.
[1:21:55] Whether you like it or not.
[1:22:01] Just learned
[1:22:03] you people love Costco. Huh?
[1:22:07] Not only sisters, brothers, too.
[1:22:10] Well, this is way better than Costco.
[1:22:15] This is way more powerful.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; And the good thing is it's free.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nehemiah 9 says, "Thou even thou
[1:22:28] our Lord alone. Thou hast made heaven,
[1:22:30] the heaven of heavens, with all their
[1:22:32] host the earth, and all things that are
[1:22:34] therein, the seas, and all that's in
[1:22:36] therein, and thou preservest them all.
[1:22:38] And the host of heaven worshipeth thee."
[1:22:41] Worshipeth thee.
[1:22:44] You don't think the stars worship, huh?
[1:22:46] They do.
[1:22:50] Psalm 33 says, "By the word of the Lord
[1:22:53] were the heavens made, and all the host
[1:22:56] of them by the breath of his mouth."
[1:23:02] Only a breath of God can create this.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[1:23:09] That's why when he breathed upon those
[1:23:12] that were in the upper room, a mighty
[1:23:15] rushing wind came in the house and
[1:23:18] filled them all with the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:22] That's the God we serve, saints, this
[1:23:24] morning. Amen. And he's the same working
[1:23:28] for us. Amen. How important it is,
[1:23:31] saints. Amen. That we give glory to him
[1:23:34] and him alone.
[1:23:37] Not to any sorry brethren not oh we have
[1:23:41] the best church. It's good you believe
[1:23:43] it if you truly believe it.
[1:23:46] We've got the best pastor. Well glory
[1:23:48] hallelujah.
[1:23:51] You know let me say what Spurgeon said.
[1:23:53] You know some people they say hey I'm
[1:23:55] looking for a perfect church. You will
[1:23:56] never find it because the moment you
[1:23:58] find it as soon as you get in it it's
[1:24:00] not perfect anymore.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Does that deal with some issues? Glory
[1:24:06] be to God.
[1:24:10] But to think when we hear about these
[1:24:13] consolations, Amen. that God forfeit,
[1:24:16] Amen. for earth is a little dust like a
[1:24:20] little tiny grain
[1:24:23] of sand in the whole universe. Now on
[1:24:26] this little grain of sand called earth,
[1:24:30] he chose fit to choose a bride.
[1:24:36] Think of it.
[1:24:38] That's how much you are important to
[1:24:40] him. That's how much he loves us.
[1:24:43] So that's why God way from the
[1:24:46] beginning, he had a purpose. He had a
[1:24:48] plan in him were attributes that he
[1:24:51] wanted to reveal to manifest. Amen. And
[1:24:54] therefore, he chose the bride before the
[1:24:56] foundation of the world.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. He chose in him.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; She's a part of him. Amen. And then
[1:25:04] those names were written. Amen. Before
[1:25:07] even there was a molecule
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; and through the ages people are grasping
[1:25:13] after the mystery of God revealed which
[1:25:15] is what Christ in you the hope of glory.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; But now is revealed to his saints.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. What a mighty God we serve.
[1:25:28] Amen. to realize that he
[1:25:31] thinks so much of us.
[1:25:38] Last night you heard you were his
[1:25:39] jewels.
[1:25:40] This morning you hear how important you
[1:25:43] are. But do we respond by telling him
[1:25:47] how important he is for us?
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; That he is our all in all.
[1:25:56] We can see in Revelations 5, Amen. How
[1:25:59] John, which is a type of the bride, and
[1:26:01] you know these verses. I'm going to read
[1:26:02] them for the sake of time. Amen. But how
[1:26:05] important it is, John, he wept because
[1:26:08] no man was found worthy to open the book
[1:26:11] and to read the book, neither to look
[1:26:13] thereon. And one of the elders said unto
[1:26:15] me, weep not. Behold, the lion of the
[1:26:18] tribe of Judah, the root of David
[1:26:23] will prevail one day.
[1:26:26] Thank you. Thank you. Some are are
[1:26:27] attentive preaching with me.
[1:26:31] The root of David hath prevailed to open
[1:26:36] the book, and to loose the seals
[1:26:38] thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the
[1:26:41] midst of the throne, and the four
[1:26:42] beasts, and in the midst of the elders
[1:26:44] stood a lamb. It had been slain, having
[1:26:46] seven horns and seven eyes, which are
[1:26:48] the seven spirits of God, sent forth
[1:26:50] into all the earth, and came and took
[1:26:52] the book out of the right hand of him
[1:26:54] that sit upon the throne. So John wept
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; because he knew, Amen. And I would be
[1:27:02] crying today. Amen. If I didn't have
[1:27:05] received an open book, a revealed word
[1:27:08] in my age, in my time,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; because I know I would be lost.
[1:27:13] That's what John was realizing. If no
[1:27:15] one is worthy to take the book of
[1:27:18] redemption to open the seals thereof,
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; but here comes a bloody lamb.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He alone is worthy
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; to look upon. Amen. To take the book, to
[1:27:32] open the seals thereof. Amen, brother
[1:27:34] David. We heard it thousand times. It
[1:27:36] ought to be everything in our life.
[1:27:40] That's why the opening of the word is a
[1:27:43] true jubilee for the bride. Is a true
[1:27:46] revival.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, notice, he is not an
[1:27:56] animal. He took the book out of the
[1:27:58] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:28:00] throne. Who was it? The owner, the
[1:28:02] original owner that had the book of
[1:28:04] redemption in his right hand. And no
[1:28:06] angel, no angelic being, nothing else
[1:28:09] could take the place. And in this bloody
[1:28:11] lamb, it walked out and took the book
[1:28:13] out of his hand. What was it, brother?
[1:28:16] The most sublime thing in the
[1:28:19] scriptures.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:28:25] if you look up the word sublime, it's
[1:28:28] not just something nice to have.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; It's not just something common,
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:36] sublime. It's the most exquisite, the
[1:28:39] most wonderful, the most glorious. Come
[1:28:41] on. And and whatever you want. But
[1:28:44] that's how important it is. If the the
[1:28:47] prophet says the most sublime thing in
[1:28:49] the scripture, an act that not an angel,
[1:28:52] nothing could do it. And the lamb come
[1:28:54] and took it from the right hand of him
[1:28:56] that sat upon the throne. What is it
[1:28:58] now? It belongs to the lamb.
[1:29:02] We see in the first seal, Amen. He
[1:29:05] speaks about the fifth chapter, the
[1:29:07] breaking of the seals. Amen. And he
[1:29:09] says, Amen. last evening we found out
[1:29:12] that John looked and seen the book till
[1:29:14] the hand is still in the hands of the
[1:29:16] original owner. He says, remember how it
[1:29:18] was lost by Adam. He forfeited the book
[1:29:22] of life for the knowledge.
[1:29:26] People want some theological lessons.
[1:29:28] People want some and I know people they
[1:29:31] don't love me for that but it's still
[1:29:32] that's okay. I still love them but we
[1:29:35] don't want a seminary.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; A seminary will not save you.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; A seminary will not make you rapture
[1:29:45] ready.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; What will make you rapture ready is a
[1:29:51] true bornagain experience where the fire
[1:29:54] of God cleans you out.
[1:29:57] Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Turns you around. That's what the word
[1:30:00] of God does. Amen. What does the word
[1:30:03] do? It will bring the hearts of the
[1:30:05] children back
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; to the hearts of the father.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Turn around. Transforming power.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; So we see, amen, those two trees, you
[1:30:19] know, the in the garden, the tree of
[1:30:21] life is a person, the tree of knowledge
[1:30:23] of good and evil is a person. Also the
[1:30:25] prophet says in the Ephesians churches
[1:30:27] we start with the fact that there were
[1:30:29] two trees. The tree of life was Jesus.
[1:30:32] There was a perfect tree that bore
[1:30:35] perfect fruit.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Now bear with me.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Still early.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; David saw it in the Psalms and said,
[1:30:44] "It's like a tree standing by the rivers
[1:30:46] of water." Sure, the rivers, many of
[1:30:49] them of one water, many gifts, the same
[1:30:53] spirit. and he bore every fruit
[1:30:55] perfectly. Then the Romans cut him down,
[1:30:59] hung him on the man-made tree. But when
[1:31:01] he come back, he ordained on the day of
[1:31:04] Pentecost, what did he ordain? A bride
[1:31:06] tree with the spirit of himself in that
[1:31:09] tree to bear the same fruit.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. I'm talking about you
[1:31:16] now.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; It's a bride tree. Jesus was the bride.
[1:31:21] He was a tree. They cut him down. He was
[1:31:23] the tree of life that was in the garden
[1:31:25] of Eden. They cut him down and hung him
[1:31:27] on the Roman tree to make fun of him.
[1:31:29] What did he do? God raised him up on the
[1:31:33] third day from the dead. And today there
[1:31:36] is a bride tree. It started back there
[1:31:40] at the beginning way back at the day of
[1:31:42] Pentecost.
[1:31:44] So we have to return back to the
[1:31:46] original Pentecost. People call emotion
[1:31:49] call the fire of God to Pentecostal. The
[1:31:52] word of God, the opening of the word
[1:31:54] doesn't bring us to a Suza street. It
[1:31:57] brings us to the original Pentecost of
[1:31:59] fire.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; What is it? The Holy Ghost punch being
[1:32:07] honed out so that they can fit with the
[1:32:10] same kind of ministry he had when he
[1:32:12] went away. that when he comes back,
[1:32:14] it'll catch the whole thing in the
[1:32:16] rapture where the justified, sanctified,
[1:32:20] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:32:22] pyramid will stand again. That's the
[1:32:24] second Bible.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; It will stand again. The house of God
[1:32:29] will live again. The tree of life is
[1:32:31] growing again.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Where? Amen. Manifested in earthn
[1:32:37] vessels.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Give me a few more moments.
[1:32:42] Because we are made of earth,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; dust of the earth,
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; we see
[1:32:53] how Eve
[1:32:57] ate of that tree of knowledge.
[1:33:02] Satan came with a lie. Surely you won't
[1:33:06] die.
[1:33:08] Your eyes will be opened.
[1:33:11] You'll be like God.
[1:33:14] What a lie.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; They were already like God.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; That's the whole thing people miss.
[1:33:24] Amen. That's why Yeah. We have spiritual
[1:33:26] amnesia and God brought us back. The
[1:33:28] word brought revealed himself for us so
[1:33:31] we see our true identity.
[1:33:36] If you would have stayed behind the
[1:33:37] word, Satan, get thee behind me.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; They were God on the earth.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; God made in the likeness of man, came
[1:33:51] down and become a redeemer to us, redeem
[1:33:52] us. And now we found out that in the
[1:33:55] days past, amen, these things which was
[1:33:57] mysterious have to be open to us in the
[1:34:00] last days.
[1:34:03] Thank God it is opened.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God he did it. Amen. And he
[1:34:09] is the one that can reveal those seven
[1:34:11] mysteries. Amen. And how the church was
[1:34:14] redeemed. And what will be the
[1:34:16] redeeming?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; So you're you're you're when you take
[1:34:21] the whole word of God. Some people take
[1:34:24] little bits and pieces and make it all
[1:34:27] kinds of weird doctrines.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Take the whole book. So the only one
[1:34:33] that could reveal the mysteries was
[1:34:36] Christ. Jesus Christ was God and him
[1:34:38] alone.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; And when the seventh seal opened, seven
[1:34:43] thunders uttered their voices. Amen. All
[1:34:45] this was revealed by the messenger of
[1:34:49] the hour.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Through, let me rephrase that. Through
[1:34:52] the messenger of the hour.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Because it's not by, it's not him, the
[1:34:59] prophet that revealed. It was God. Even
[1:35:02] the prophet when he saw he said if he
[1:35:04] wouldn't have come down I would have
[1:35:05] made a total mess. I would have said
[1:35:07] something wrong.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; So it's all hidden in the book of
[1:35:15] mystery here. It's sealed up with seven
[1:35:17] seals. That's why it is so I love the
[1:35:21] opening of the word because when you see
[1:35:23] your name in the book when you see when
[1:35:25] you realize what God has done before
[1:35:29] even you
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; anyone breathe his first breath
[1:35:36] it was already settled
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; are you hearing me
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; now that doesn't mean that you say I'm
[1:35:44] done I don't have to do a thing no that
[1:35:45] No, no. Cuz if you're a true
[1:35:48] predestinated seed, you will answer to
[1:35:50] the call.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; What does the Bible tell us? By their
[1:35:55] fruits will you know them.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet says if you want
[1:36:01] to look in the scripture, you can get
[1:36:02] over in Jeremiah.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jeremiah. And find out there where
[1:36:07] he was going into captivity of the land.
[1:36:10] You know, he bought his uncle's son had
[1:36:13] some property. He went through the
[1:36:14] ceiling. Amen. So here the prophet you
[1:36:17] remember when he says after the opening
[1:36:20] opening of the seals opening of the word
[1:36:22] this Bible became a new Bible.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; What did it mean? He could read the
[1:36:29] Bible and we can read the Bible with
[1:36:32] through the revealed word and we see
[1:36:35] Christ and his groom in all types.
[1:36:41] Here he speaks about Jeremiah. Let's go
[1:36:44] to Jeremiah. Amen. And he says,
[1:36:46] Jeremiah, the word of the Lord came unto
[1:36:48] me, saying Jeremiah 32, behold Hanil,
[1:36:51] the son of Shalom, thine uncle shall
[1:36:53] come unto thee, saying, buy thee my
[1:36:55] field that is in Anat for right of
[1:36:57] redemption is thine to buy. That makes
[1:37:00] me think of Ruth and Boas. That makes me
[1:37:03] think of Christ and his bride.
[1:37:07] There's only one that was worthy.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We we will go down a little. Thus
[1:37:13] say the Lord of hosts. So we see how
[1:37:16] Amen. the the the the the purchase goes
[1:37:19] on and you know even today when
[1:37:21] something is purchased you have to go
[1:37:24] Amen through legal act write things
[1:37:26] down. It's the same in the United
[1:37:28] States. I know.
[1:37:31] But what happened? Look. Amen. He says
[1:37:35] and I charge Barrick before the saying
[1:37:37] thus say the Lord of hosts the son of
[1:37:38] the the God of Israel. Take these
[1:37:40] evidences. this evidence of the purchase
[1:37:43] boats which is sealed and the evidence
[1:37:44] which is open and put them in an earthn
[1:37:46] vessel that they may continue many days.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; So he knew he was going to go in
[1:37:52] captivity but he said make sure my
[1:37:55] heritage
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; is safe.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Come on saints.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We're going somewhere and
[1:38:04] we're going to for a rapture. Amen. Now
[1:38:07] it may continue for many days. For thus
[1:38:09] say the Lord of hosts, the God of
[1:38:11] Israel, houses and fields and vineyards
[1:38:13] shall be possessed again in this land.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Will there be a rapture? Oh yes, God
[1:38:21] made sure.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Will there be a bride without spot on?
[1:38:25] Oh yeah, God made sure.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The prophet says when
[1:38:32] Jeremiah wrote this book, it was sealed.
[1:38:34] Amen. He was going to be gone. So he
[1:38:37] wanted to be sure that the seal, his
[1:38:39] inheritance would be kept. Amen. So he
[1:38:42] inherit his cousin's inheritance. So he
[1:38:44] had it all wrote up legally. And what
[1:38:46] did he do? What did he do with it? I
[1:38:49] love that part of where the prophet says
[1:38:52] he sealed it up, put it in an vessel so
[1:38:56] it wouldn't rot or rust.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Rot is stinky.
[1:39:07] That's why God doesn't want us to be
[1:39:09] lukewarm.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Makes him vomit.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; He wants us on fire for God.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't want us rusty in church.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; I know I've told the story in several
[1:39:30] several churches. Amen. But I love the
[1:39:33] revelation of my grandpa. He was a bike
[1:39:35] rider, you know, a racer and and did
[1:39:39] many many miles on his bike. And and he
[1:39:42] had this revelation
[1:39:44] everything had, you know, this chain had
[1:39:47] to be welloiled.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; So welloiled if you went for a ride,
[1:39:52] well, your pants was just black with
[1:39:54] oil.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I love that revelation because I'm
[1:39:58] going to bring it to us now.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. The oil. We need more oil than you
[1:40:03] can think of.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is foolish virgin. There's
[1:40:06] wise virgin. Amen. And some they had oil
[1:40:09] in their lamb. The other said, "Give me
[1:40:11] some." No, it's too late now. So fill me
[1:40:13] up, Lord. Give me more. That's what this
[1:40:16] meeting and every meeting is about.
[1:40:25] So if Jeremiah didn't want his his
[1:40:29] heritage to rot or rust,
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; What do you think, God? These are all
[1:40:35] old types. Let me continue.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. He put it in an earthly vessel and
[1:40:40] put it away so it wouldn't rot or rust
[1:40:41] until him 70 years were expired. He put
[1:40:44] it in an earthly vessel. He created
[1:40:46] himself. Now he brings it his own son,
[1:40:48] Christ Jesus. And in this last day now,
[1:40:51] he's opening the seals and showing it to
[1:40:54] his church kept in an earthly vessel so
[1:40:57] it wouldn't rot or rust.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; We don't need church members.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Brother David, who do you think you are?
[1:41:12] I'm a nobody, but I believe the word of
[1:41:16] God.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And I never want to be a rotten person,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; nor a rusty person.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I want to be so filled with the oil of
[1:41:28] God.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what I go through, I
[1:41:33] will be on the front line worshiping. I
[1:41:36] will be there giving glory to God.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he said that we are joint
[1:41:42] hes.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; So he made sure that his inheritance our
[1:41:47] inheritance that comes when somebody
[1:41:50] dies
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; and somebody died at my stake at my
[1:41:54] place at your place so that I can
[1:41:57] inherit all things.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about money value. I'm
[1:42:03] talking about everything he has. We own
[1:42:08] everything he is. We are.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; So it's been kept wrapped in the vessel
[1:42:24] of the earth that was redeemed out of
[1:42:25] the earth. Come up on that Easter
[1:42:27] morning where that seal could not hold
[1:42:29] him any longer. Think of it.
[1:42:33] Think of it. Satan tried
[1:42:37] with Jesus.
[1:42:39] So certainly he will try with us.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; He thought he had him.
[1:42:47] Stupid devil.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; How many times did he think he had you?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; How many times even we thought he had
[1:42:57] us?
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; But then something within me I was
[1:43:00] reading. Amen. the other day how brother
[1:43:02] Brandham going through his hardest trial
[1:43:04] was saying yes Satan came in my mind and
[1:43:07] there lays your daughter there lays your
[1:43:09] wife and when you preach you want to
[1:43:11] talk about a loving God
[1:43:15] a merciful God that doesn't even answer
[1:43:18] your prayer you pray for thousands and
[1:43:20] and God doesn't answer is that a loving
[1:43:22] God and then he says a prophet and then
[1:43:25] something way deep down in my heart said
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:43:31] Oh yeah. Let us doubt our doubts. Amen.
[1:43:34] When we go through the fear trial, Amen.
[1:43:37] Never forget there's something inside.
[1:43:40] Amen. That is anchored in Christ. It's a
[1:43:42] part of himself.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:49] His death seal could not hold him any
[1:43:51] longer. But he broke the seals and rose
[1:43:53] up and proving himself in the last day
[1:43:55] that he is alive.
[1:43:58] He's in his church.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; How does he prove he's alive?
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; He does it in his church. And I'm not
[1:44:10] going to call you church any longer. I'm
[1:44:13] going to call you bride.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, who was the earthly vessel?
[1:44:20] Jesus Christ. Amen. And it was written
[1:44:22] in the word. It was hid so that you
[1:44:24] couldn't even find it. That's why it's
[1:44:26] hid from the wise, the prudent, the
[1:44:28] theologians, and it's revealed to little
[1:44:30] babes like me, like us.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; That's why I can worship him. Amen. That
[1:44:35] doesn't need a certain degree. It
[1:44:37] doesn't need a certain intellectual
[1:44:40] coefficient.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Just say, I believe it, Lord.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; That speaks of me.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And then he
[1:44:52] says, "When you get into how God opening
[1:44:54] up them seals and showing it, come right
[1:44:57] on down." You see, when you do, then you
[1:45:00] can get away from this book.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; You can't get away from this book.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Why? That's my true identity.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; You want to see my identity card? I'll
[1:45:14] show you a picture.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; That's my head.
[1:45:30] It doesn't show my feet.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Even in America, it doesn't show the
[1:45:35] feet. It doesn't give the size of your
[1:45:38] shoes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; It shows your head.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Amen. So Jeremiah said,
[1:45:47] "This scroll must be kept." Amen. And he
[1:45:50] must be kept in an earthly vessel. Oh,
[1:45:52] what a beautiful thing there is. I could
[1:45:53] take for a while. He says, "This scroll
[1:45:56] was kept in an earthly vessel. A vessel
[1:45:58] that once became flesh, glory, died,
[1:46:01] rose again, and kept in an earthly
[1:46:03] vessel and until the time of purchase."
[1:46:07] Now, we read in Revelation that the lion
[1:46:10] has prevailed.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; That means it's done. He has already
[1:46:15] done it. Victory is mine. Now I can tell
[1:46:19] Satan, get thee behind me cuz victory is
[1:46:22] mine.
[1:46:30] Hallelujah. We see that the seventh
[1:46:33] angel. Amen. Daniel. Amen. We can read
[1:46:35] it. He heard the voice as thunders. It
[1:46:38] was forbidden to ride. John was
[1:46:40] forbidden to ride. It was sealed. Amen.
[1:46:43] But God. Amen. the mystery of who God is
[1:46:46] and how he was made flesh and all these
[1:46:48] things should be involved at now at that
[1:46:51] time.
[1:46:53] We are a happy people
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; and we have a very happy meal this
[1:46:59] morning.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Just thought of that.
[1:47:06] Everybody knows that. Huh? We've we have
[1:47:09] a true happy meal.
[1:47:14] And I say that with all respect of
[1:47:16] course.
[1:47:17] So the seventh angel of Revelation 10:7.
[1:47:21] Amen. We heard that. Amen. What does it
[1:47:23] say? Amen. In the days of the voice
[1:47:28] of the seventh angel. So if there is a
[1:47:30] voice, there has to be a people that
[1:47:33] hear.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Speak to me.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Here I am, Lord. Speak to me.
[1:47:41] Tell me who I am. Tell me what's the
[1:47:43] purpose in my life.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So he says, Amen. This is
[1:47:50] finishing all the mysteries of God that
[1:47:53] are written in the book. It finishes the
[1:47:57] entire mystery.
[1:48:00] What was that mystery?
[1:48:04] Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:48:10] My is that what the plan is, brother
[1:48:12] David? Yes. Because he did certain
[1:48:15] things while he was on this earth, but
[1:48:17] he couldn't do all things.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; He left certain things for us to do.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. You look into the mirror, which is
[1:48:28] the word of God, until you truly see
[1:48:32] your identity.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Yeah.
[1:48:37] Can I go on for a little while? Won't be
[1:48:40] long.
[1:48:44] So, it's supposed Amen. He says, "All
[1:48:46] the mystery of the mystery book is
[1:48:47] revealed." Amen. To the loud messenger
[1:48:50] of that age. Now,
[1:48:54] when he rose that day, he came forth.
[1:48:57] So, where was the book at? It was still
[1:49:00] in the abstract owner, God Almighty.
[1:49:02] When Satan thought he had him,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; said, "Now I have a right." He has no
[1:49:08] right whatsoever.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us, "He's not even in
[1:49:12] the picture."
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? He's not even in the
[1:49:18] picture.
[1:49:20] He's but a stump on the side of the road
[1:49:22] bringing his children to it. So God is
[1:49:24] actually using
[1:49:26] this stump to bring his people to
[1:49:29] himself.
[1:49:31] My that puts Satan back in its position,
[1:49:34] huh?
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Doesn't it? And John looked around.
[1:49:37] Amen. He said he wept because no man was
[1:49:40] worthy to look on and book and espec on
[1:49:42] the book and especially open the seals
[1:49:44] to reveal what was hidden hidden. The
[1:49:46] mystery was in the seven seals. And when
[1:49:48] these seven seals were open that opened
[1:49:50] up the entire Bible
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; and it was the book of redemption.
[1:49:57] Wow. So if you want to see
[1:50:01] your name.
[1:50:03] You have to look into the book.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; Face the book.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Not Facebook. Face the book.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; I know it's been said before, but it has
[1:50:17] become a reality. People spend hours on
[1:50:19] Facebook.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Spend more time in facing the book,
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; reading the book, eating the book,
[1:50:27] becoming the book.
[1:50:31] The prophet says, "Amen." And I'm
[1:50:34] saying, "A Christian, he ought to be a
[1:50:36] hallelujah from head to toes."
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. From head to toes.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now security. Those who he
[1:50:49] forneew, he called. Those who he called,
[1:50:51] he justified. Those who he justified has
[1:50:54] already glorified." John tells us here
[1:50:56] in Revelation that the enemy in the last
[1:50:58] days is a very religious enemy.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would get amongst the people
[1:51:04] and have organizations and so forth and
[1:51:07] cults and so forth and as they have
[1:51:10] today and would deceive the very elect
[1:51:13] if it were possible
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; and would deceive all whose names are
[1:51:19] not put on the lamb's book of lives
[1:51:22] since the very foundation of the world.
[1:51:25] Think of it. It would be so close,
[1:51:29] one word to Eve. But God made sure
[1:51:33] when he sealed that book
[1:51:37] that it wouldn't go to any owner
[1:51:39] whatsoever. He remained the owner. He
[1:51:42] put it in an vessel. So he becomes my
[1:51:45] kinsman, redeemer. And now he says,
[1:51:48] because I live, ye can live also. I have
[1:51:51] to go for a little while, but I'll send
[1:51:53] you the comforter. I'll send you the
[1:51:55] guide. He will guide you in my truth, in
[1:51:58] all truth. I am the way. I am the truth.
[1:52:01] I am the life. I will send you my life.
[1:52:04] I will send you my spirit.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; When was your name put on the lamb's
[1:52:12] book of life? 1900 years ago. No, sir.
[1:52:15] Before the foundation of the word. So,
[1:52:17] what is he doing? If it's these seals
[1:52:20] opening up now, just beginning to reveal
[1:52:22] the plan of redemption. Think of it.
[1:52:25] That's what is going on.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; When you've been redeemed,
[1:52:33] that means you've been bought back.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; That means I own I was owned by
[1:52:41] the same he buys me back. Is that okay?
[1:52:45] I'm not expert in English, but I
[1:52:47] understand that.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; So that's these seals opening up. He
[1:52:55] says how he did it. Amen. Oh, so we're
[1:52:58] at the end time. Amen. So we had
[1:53:01] fellowship with him. Think of it. I
[1:53:04] spoke how great God was. Plads, Orion,
[1:53:07] all these things.
[1:53:10] And now he brings us back to where were
[1:53:13] thou.
[1:53:16] We had fellowship with him before the
[1:53:20] foundation of the world.
[1:53:23] Okay, that makes our mind a little but
[1:53:26] it's not about the mind. It's about
[1:53:28] here.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; This seed can receive and say amen.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. when the morning stars sang
[1:53:35] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:53:37] joy way back before the foundation of
[1:53:39] the world. How do we know that that
[1:53:41] wasn't at the same time that the lamb
[1:53:43] was slain that when God in his great
[1:53:45] thinking he seen us
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; having a pity party?
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; He has seen us amen shouting and
[1:53:57] rejoicing in our salvation through
[1:54:01] Jesus.
[1:54:03] And you tell me I couldn't shout. I
[1:54:05] couldn't rejoice this morning.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; That's what the seals. It's a jubilee.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I was lost, but I have been found. Glory
[1:54:14] be to God.
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; Who were those sons of God that was
[1:54:21] shouting for joy? Jesus told them that I
[1:54:25] had joy with you before the foundation
[1:54:29] of the world. And we're not creatures of
[1:54:32] time. We're creatures of eternity.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; I think brother Andrew said it last
[1:54:41] night talking about brother Ron, brother
[1:54:43] M. And
[1:54:46] to think what what all that Satan puts
[1:54:49] against
[1:54:51] true servant of God tries this he still
[1:54:55] stands faithful not depending on his
[1:54:58] strength but on God's strength.
[1:55:01] And let me even put it now this way.
[1:55:02] Satan, is that all what you got? Oh,
[1:55:05] brother David, it's easy to say that
[1:55:07] you're not going through it. You don't
[1:55:08] know what I'm going through.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; God puts trials on each and every one of
[1:55:12] us. He knows it's according to what he
[1:55:15] allows
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; and he gives us a measure. But in the
[1:55:18] trial, he gives us the strength to go
[1:55:20] through.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; So, Satan is at the best.
[1:55:28] You know today people are afraid of
[1:55:30] dying and uh the prophet he says you
[1:55:33] know death is is nothing. People are
[1:55:37] afraid of it. As a true son or daughter
[1:55:39] of God the moment we breathe out a final
[1:55:44] breath. The next one we're in his
[1:55:48] presence.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not speaking that somebody's going
[1:55:54] to die. Please understand me because the
[1:55:56] word of God.
[1:55:58] No, no, no. But the word of God tells us
[1:56:01] that we will not die. We will tell the
[1:56:03] glory of God. Tell of the goodness of
[1:56:06] God. Amen. So I had joy with you before
[1:56:09] the foundation. Amen. And we see that
[1:56:12] Adam everything obeyed him. Amen. Adam
[1:56:15] was in God. Amen. What Adam was in God,
[1:56:18] Christ has redeemed us back to that.
[1:56:26] to even phantom think what God is
[1:56:29] telling us. That's the plan for each and
[1:56:32] every one of us in this age. Amen. So
[1:56:36] everything obeyed him. Amen. So
[1:56:40] why can't we rejoice?
[1:56:42] Because God made sure
[1:56:46] that the word would not be rotten
[1:56:50] or rusty. He put it in an earthn vessel,
[1:56:54] Jesus Christ. And now comes at the voice
[1:56:58] of the seventh messenger. When he shall
[1:57:01] be begin to sound, the mystery shall be
[1:57:04] revealed. What of what God's plan is for
[1:57:09] us to take up all the loose ends, reveal
[1:57:12] all the mysteries, and tell us there's a
[1:57:15] bride ministry. What is that bride
[1:57:18] ministry? Christ in you, the hope of
[1:57:21] glory.
[1:57:23] Can I go on for a few more moments?
[1:57:25] So, we see, Amen. In Revelation, Amen.
[1:57:29] 10:1.
[1:57:32] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[1:57:34] from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a
[1:57:37] rainbow was upon his head.
[1:57:40] Cloud.
[1:57:42] Amen. and his face was as it were the
[1:57:45] sun and his feet as pillars of fire.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; So we see he is our head and the body is
[1:57:55] on earth.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; We are his body.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:22 says and had put all
[1:58:01] things under his feet and he gave him to
[1:58:04] the to be the head over all things to
[1:58:06] the church which is his body the
[1:58:08] fullness of him that fillth all in all.
[1:58:12] The prophet tells us headship is here
[1:58:14] now.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Not will now is here.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; So what happened in the upper room? What
[1:58:21] was God doing? Amen. He was separating
[1:58:24] tongues of fire was separating that big
[1:58:27] pillar of fire and dividing himself
[1:58:30] among his people.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed it doesn't say and his
[1:58:34] feet as pillar singular of fire pillars
[1:58:39] of fire. The Holy Ghost, the prophet
[1:58:42] says, separated itself the day of
[1:58:44] Pentecost. God separating himself. That
[1:58:47] day you'll know that I am in the father,
[1:58:49] the father in me, and I in you, and you
[1:58:51] in me. What day? This day.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; That's why I ask you the question, what
[1:58:57] is the opening of the word to you?
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; This day.
[1:59:03] This day.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; God was in one man, Christ Jesus. In him
[1:59:10] dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[1:59:11] bodily. Now when that pillar of fire
[1:59:13] came down at Pentecost, you notice
[1:59:16] tongues of fire set upon each of them.
[1:59:19] That was God separating himself from the
[1:59:21] pillar of fire into each member of his
[1:59:24] church. God separating himself so he
[1:59:27] could be universally
[1:59:30] all over everywhere at one time.
[1:59:38] We talked about how the galaxies and all
[1:59:40] these stars and and all that is in his
[1:59:43] hand
[1:59:45] and our lives is in his hand.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Never doubt that.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; He we we you know that song he holds the
[1:59:52] whole word in his hand. He holds my life
[1:59:55] in his hand.
[1:59:59] So God separating himself to his church.
[2:00:02] No wonder he spoke, "Wherever two or
[2:00:03] three are gathered in my name, I'll be
[2:00:05] in their midst. So if two will agree
[2:00:07] upon anything and ask, I'll give it to
[2:00:10] you."
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let let's not miss our God-given
[2:00:14] privileges. On day of Pentecost, when
[2:00:16] this great light came in here, God
[2:00:18] divided himself. Amen. Separating
[2:00:21] himself amongst his people. Now listen,
[2:00:26] we become God's own life in us.
[2:00:31] Oh my,
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; that is glorious.
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost, God dividing himself,
[2:00:40] making him sons and daughters.
[2:00:43] That's why
[2:00:46] Satan has to be under our feet. Those
[2:00:49] pillars of fire because the head, he's
[2:00:52] the head, the body is on the earth, and
[2:00:55] Satan has to be under our feet.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Nowhere else. but under your feet. Amen.
[2:01:03] So, we're not a defeated people. We are
[2:01:05] an overcoming people.
[2:01:08] Amen. We have the victory in Jesus.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We can rise above every
[2:01:15] trial and temptation. Amen. Let them
[2:01:18] know, says the prophet, that they can
[2:01:19] possess the gate of the enemy because
[2:01:21] every enemy has been put under the feet
[2:01:24] of Christ. Amen. And every enemy is
[2:01:27] under your feet as long as you are in
[2:01:30] Christ because everything is under his
[2:01:32] feet. And how do we get into him? By one
[2:01:35] spirit. We are all baptized in one body,
[2:01:38] been made partakers
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; of the same blessing, the same power.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; I know that's not skim milk, but it's
[2:01:50] still the truth.
[2:01:55] So we see how God had this plan and in
[2:01:59] the super sign he says
[2:02:01] if the world could only see that God and
[2:02:05] man are one.
[2:02:07] Huh? God and man are one. The super sign
[2:02:11] was the first man that could God that
[2:02:13] God could come into and all that God was
[2:02:15] he poured into Christ. And all Christ
[2:02:18] was he poured into the church. a super
[2:02:21] sign, God and man together. That was to
[2:02:23] be the super sign of the last day.
[2:02:28] When the entire Bible
[2:02:31] was to be fulfilled in the last days,
[2:02:36] the entire Bible
[2:02:38] open book to be fulfilled in our days.
[2:02:44] A super sign. Amen. The church has got a
[2:02:47] super sign. God back in the church
[2:02:51] manifested in human flesh again.
[2:02:56] That's where I got my title.
[2:03:01] The mystery
[2:03:04] revealed
[2:03:06] manifested
[2:03:08] in a many membered body.
[2:03:13] Isn't that a wonderful love story? how
[2:03:17] God he hid all these things
[2:03:22] and he left it for us. He chose us to
[2:03:26] think that when we will sit at this
[2:03:29] wonderful table of miles
[2:03:34] cuz I'm getting ready for a wedding
[2:03:36] supper. Huh?
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; The wedding goes on here. Huh? The union
[2:03:42] is right now.
[2:03:44] We going to go on the wedding supper and
[2:03:47] even to think of the heroes of our
[2:03:49] faith. Brother Ron,
[2:03:52] they will come say brother Ron
[2:03:56] tell me how it was in in this hard age
[2:03:59] dark age
[2:04:03] where everything Satan had was poured
[2:04:07] but everything God had
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; was revealed to his people.
[2:04:13] Tell us, brother Rob.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, many things were put on you, but how
[2:04:20] you stood faithful,
[2:04:23] how God gave you strength, how you stood
[2:04:26] on every promise. I'm not lifting up
[2:04:28] brother Ron. I'm just destroying Satan.
[2:04:36] We love our our we have a favorite
[2:04:40] you know
[2:04:41] somebody in the Bible that's my favorite
[2:04:43] that's my favorite that's my favorite
[2:04:46] think of it they will come and say hey
[2:04:47] you young boys
[2:04:50] tell me how it was
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; because we know hell is on it this let
[2:04:58] me put it this way Satan in the garden
[2:05:00] of Eden he took a bride bride out of
[2:05:04] God's Eden.
[2:05:07] He didn't.
[2:05:10] But now God is taking a bride out of
[2:05:14] Satan's Eden
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; to prove that he is the God Almighty.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; He is the God Almighty.
[2:05:27] Satan, you're but a loser.
[2:05:34] You know, I don't say that just lightly
[2:05:37] to say Satan, you but no. And it ought
[2:05:41] to be for each and everyone the same.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; It's not just something we say even
[2:05:46] though we can go through trials and yes,
[2:05:49] but still we have the victory
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; in Jesus.
[2:05:55] That's why I talked I started by just
[2:05:58] remembering you how great our God is.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; The one who holds the universe. The one
[2:06:05] even this morning
[2:06:08] maybe it was a little chilly. It was a
[2:06:09] little cold, a little slippery. That's
[2:06:12] okay.
[2:06:13] This morning the sun rose.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; It proved that there was a resurrection.
[2:06:21] That's why even this morning we are
[2:06:23] celebrating the resurrection
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; and the prophet says what erection this
[2:06:28] was but what erection resurrection this
[2:06:30] is
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; in each and every one of us the more we
[2:06:34] hear God speaking to us the more we see
[2:06:37] our true identity and we realize
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; Satan you're but a bluff
[2:06:46] &gt;&gt; that's right
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; hallelujah Yeah. How the word and man
[2:06:50] become one.
[2:06:52] Become one. Oh yes. That's what it's
[2:06:55] about.
[2:06:56] That's why
[2:06:58] what is going on today.
[2:07:01] It's a very important time. The prophet
[2:07:04] says we're standing to tonight, but I'm
[2:07:06] going to say this morning upon the brim
[2:07:10] and watching come to pass and unfold two
[2:07:13] great scenes.
[2:07:16] And those two great scenes are these.
[2:07:18] One of them is the ending of history.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[2:07:24] And the other one is the ending of time.
[2:07:27] And many great men down through the ages
[2:07:29] has longed to see this hour that we're
[2:07:33] now approaching. And as we live in this
[2:07:36] glorious setting of mortal sun and the
[2:07:38] breaking of the eternal light, I do feel
[2:07:40] that we're living in one of the grandest
[2:07:43] ages.
[2:07:49] It's not make America great again.
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; I love you.
[2:07:58] I'm not going to call you Americans,
[2:07:59] brothers and sisters.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; But God is having the grandest time now
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; manifesting himself
[2:08:11] an earn vessels again.
[2:08:15] proving that he is almighty.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And feel that we're living in the
[2:08:20] groundest age that ever man has been
[2:08:21] permitted to live because it's what? The
[2:08:24] closing out of time and the blending in
[2:08:29] of eternity.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Think of it.
[2:08:35] The Bible tells us in a moment, a
[2:08:39] twinkling of an eye,
[2:08:42] I shall be changed.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells, "Amen." How Amen.
[2:08:51] I can I when he went
[2:08:54] beyond the curtain of time, I have hair.
[2:08:58] Oh, yeah. They're numbered. Think of it.
[2:09:02] One, two, three, seven million, 8
[2:09:03] million. I don't know how many we have.
[2:09:07] God bless you, bold brothers. They're
[2:09:09] all numbered,
[2:09:12] but think how great our God is.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; In a twinkling of an eye. Amen. We will
[2:09:19] have a service like yesterday, like
[2:09:21] today, or no matter how many more
[2:09:24] services we will have. Amen. And all of
[2:09:26] a sudden, oh, there's our beloved one
[2:09:29] coming in,
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; having his victory dance like you had,
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; brother Homer. Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; Maybe some of you young kids, you you've
[2:09:41] never seen him young.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; You should ask a picture
[2:09:46] so you recognize him.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And some will don't will not see it.
[2:09:54] They will call you crazy just like they
[2:09:56] will call you holy roll. Just like they
[2:09:58] will call you all kinds of names.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; I don't care
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; because soon you know what they call
[2:10:04] going to call me? They're going to call
[2:10:05] me God.
[2:10:13] Why don't we stand?
[2:10:15] Hallelujah.
[2:10:16] Amen. So, Amen. We're living in a
[2:10:19] glorious time, saints. Amen.
[2:10:24] is the most glor sublime. Sublime.
[2:10:27] Sorry. Sublime is French. Those who are
[2:10:29] learning French,
[2:10:31] Mr. Reagan. Sublime. That's French.
[2:10:39] And the invisible union. You know, even
[2:10:42] t the the the sermons that the prophet
[2:10:45] titled
[2:10:47] for me is a subject of worship.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; Why cry? speak.
[2:10:54] Think of it
[2:10:57] the invisible union of the bride.
[2:11:01] The prophet tells us
[2:11:03] says, "And Jesus, he took the word. He
[2:11:07] took my place. He became me that a
[2:11:11] sinner that I might become him the
[2:11:16] word."
[2:11:18] That's why it was sealed, put in an
[2:11:21] vessel, made sure it didn't rot,
[2:11:24] it didn't rust. Do you know that the in
[2:11:27] and in in the mana was put in the ark
[2:11:32] to make sure that and it w it was kept
[2:11:35] fresh
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; so that every generation could come and
[2:11:40] taste. Think of it. And here we are in
[2:11:43] the grandest hour, grandest time ever.
[2:11:48] Are you realizing
[2:11:51] the grandest time?
[2:11:53] &gt;&gt; We ought to act like real true
[2:11:58] sons and daughters of God.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Grand this time
[2:12:05] that he still today
[2:12:08] feeds us
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; true mala.
[2:12:12] himself
[2:12:15] inspiring the ministers to give us
[2:12:19] food in due season.
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Why in due season? Because this is the
[2:12:26] grandest season
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; where a bride is getting ready for a
[2:12:32] rapture, for a body change.
[2:12:35] And then
[2:12:37] think of it, there 144,000 Jews
[2:12:43] that are waiting.
[2:12:46] When he's done with the Gentiles, it's
[2:12:49] over. It's over.
[2:12:52] The prophet tells us some will even
[2:12:54] preach the rapture. They will keep on
[2:12:56] preaching the message and the rapture
[2:12:58] will have already be gone.
[2:13:02] So saints, may I encourage you to seize,
[2:13:05] take every opportunity,
[2:13:09] whether it's here on the internet, no
[2:13:10] matter where you may be,
[2:13:13] seize every opportunity
[2:13:17] to receive from God
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; because you're going to need oil
[2:13:25] more than ever.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; And there is still oil to receive.
[2:13:33] Brother David,
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; why do you emphasize on that? Very
[2:13:39] simple.
[2:13:42] There's wise and foolish versions.
[2:13:45] Let me be the wise one and seek more of
[2:13:49] God. Can we
[2:13:54] So the word took my place. He became me
[2:13:58] that a sinner that I might become him.
[2:14:00] The word he says, "Oh, that spiritual
[2:14:04] union of Christ and his church." Now
[2:14:09] when the flesh is becoming the word and
[2:14:12] the word is becoming the flesh
[2:14:15] manifested
[2:14:17] vindicated
[2:14:20] just what the Bible said would happen in
[2:14:25] this day
[2:14:28] and he adds and it's happening day by
[2:14:32] day.
[2:14:34] That's why saints of God, it's happening
[2:14:37] day by day. And when the last one will
[2:14:40] come in, rapture will take place.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think, I'm sorry, young
[2:14:45] guys, young brothers.
[2:14:49] Don't think we have
[2:14:51] 80 more years. I'm not prophesying here
[2:14:53] now, but I'm just seeing the signs of
[2:14:55] the end time.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us even that this age
[2:14:59] is a very short age.
[2:15:04] Seeing the signs of the time,
[2:15:07] let's run with everything that is within
[2:15:09] us.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; Let's seize every opportunity. Not only
[2:15:13] young people, hey, each and every one of
[2:15:15] us
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; so we are rapture ready.
[2:15:21] He says God finishing with that walking
[2:15:26] on two feet.
[2:15:28] That's why he spoke about those pillars
[2:15:30] of fire.
[2:15:32] God walking on two feet. Come on. In
[2:15:37] you.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; You walk in the streets of Brutus. No
[2:15:45] matter where you're from, God walking on
[2:15:47] two feet in you. Yes.
[2:15:52] And he will make sure that his word as
[2:15:55] you become the word and the word word
[2:15:57] becomes you that it's not rotten that
[2:16:00] it's not rusty but the word is alive.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word my word is spirit and
[2:16:06] truth.
[2:16:08] It is alive and well. He made sure
[2:16:12] saints that nothing would be lost.
[2:16:18] That's why I love him so much.
[2:16:21] God walking two feet in you. The
[2:16:24] footstep of the righteous are ordered of
[2:16:27] God. God walking in you.
[2:16:31] For ye are written epistles
[2:16:35] read of all men.
[2:16:39] Sorry brother bringing back to you.
[2:16:43] Your pastor can go in a hospital
[2:16:46] touch even lives there.
[2:16:50] Cuz it's God walking in two feet
[2:16:56] going in there
[2:16:58] touching many hearts
[2:17:02] because he has a testimony.
[2:17:04] The word of God tells us in the upper
[2:17:07] room we have to be witnesses. That means
[2:17:11] we have a testimony. We have an
[2:17:13] experience. We have something to give.
[2:17:17] What is that something?
[2:17:20] Jesus Christ. He is alive. He is real.
[2:17:25] And he's living in you and me, walking
[2:17:28] in two feets. And if the life that is in
[2:17:32] Christ be in you, you will bear the life
[2:17:35] that Christ bore.
[2:17:38] Saints of God,
[2:17:43] I hope we will meet again.
[2:17:45] But let me put it different. The sooner
[2:17:49] the rapture comes, the better.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; So if that was the last one or the first
[2:17:57] time,
[2:17:59] what matters is
[2:18:02] that this word
[2:18:05] becomes you
[2:18:07] and you become that word.
[2:18:10] That you become the manifestation of
[2:18:13] God's plan. the mystery that was hidden,
[2:18:16] but now reveal Christ in you from young
[2:18:21] to old
[2:18:24] and destroying everything Satan will
[2:18:26] try.
[2:18:28] And he will try like you heard
[2:18:31] yesterday,
[2:18:33] he is greater in you than he that is
[2:18:36] completely against you. So may God
[2:18:39] richly bless you. I love you dearly with
[2:18:43] all my heart. And what a time we will
[2:18:47] have
[2:18:49] at that wedding supper.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; We will remember, brother David.
[2:18:54] Remember
[2:18:56] that December. Oh yeah. How God was good
[2:18:59] then. How was talking about the goodness
[2:19:02] of God.
[2:19:04] When you start counting your blessings,
[2:19:06] saints,
[2:19:08] count them one by one.
[2:19:12] You will see all the rest will
[2:19:15] disappear. We serve a mighty God. Let's
[2:19:19] pray. Dear heavenly father,
[2:19:23] father, your words been spoken, Lord.
[2:19:26] How you led it on upon my heart.
[2:19:31] The mystery of Christ in us, the hope of
[2:19:34] glory. Lord, we know
[2:19:38] that is your desire.
[2:19:40] You had a plan from before the
[2:19:42] foundation of the world. And now, Lord
[2:19:45] God, as we live in this grandest time,
[2:19:48] grandest age
[2:19:50] for the bride,
[2:19:53] Lord, we want to come to you. Say, "Here
[2:19:55] I am, Father.
[2:19:58] Do as you please, Father. Let it be
[2:20:00] according to thy word.
[2:20:03] Use me. Let me be an instrument, a
[2:20:06] vessel that you can take full control
[2:20:09] over.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Let me be that vessel, Lord God, where
[2:20:13] you can reveal, manifest yourself
[2:20:15] through fully to such an extent
[2:20:20] where you can guide my footsteps.
[2:20:23] Turn left, turn right, go there. There's
[2:20:25] a need.
[2:20:27] Silver and gold have I none, but what I
[2:20:31] have, I give it in the name of the Lord
[2:20:32] Jesus Christ.
[2:20:35] Lord, I heard your your prophet
[2:20:38] as I was in the plane and that struck
[2:20:40] me.
[2:20:43] He was praying and there was a need
[2:20:46] and he acted according to your word.
[2:20:52] He said, "Brother, I give you your
[2:20:56] healing in the name of Jesus Christ."
[2:21:00] That's your word. Let it be according to
[2:21:02] your word. Father, may we be sensitive
[2:21:05] to your spirit, Lord God. Wherever we
[2:21:08] go, Father, Lord, may you be with us,
[2:21:11] young or old. Lord God,
[2:21:14] may you have your way in our lives.
[2:21:18] I pray God may you bless this church as
[2:21:21] it has been a lighthouse through the
[2:21:23] years. May you continue and bless it
[2:21:26] father. Bless the ministry Lord God.
[2:21:29] Bless brother Ron Lord the pastor here
[2:21:32] father. Lord as we are standing Lord
[2:21:35] uniting our faith and your word says if
[2:21:39] we can agree upon anything it is done.
[2:21:45] So Lord God, we bind every demon of
[2:21:47] hell.
[2:21:49] He has no authority.
[2:21:52] Satan, you're but a bluff. And we claim
[2:21:54] the victory in Jesus name. Lord, may you
[2:21:57] bless each and everyone in the church,
[2:21:59] every office. Lord God, bless brother
[2:22:01] Andrew. Lord, may you be with the the
[2:22:04] whole family. Lord God,
[2:22:07] may you give them wisdom and guidance in
[2:22:09] all things.
[2:22:11] As we prepare, Lord God, for this great
[2:22:13] wedding supper,
[2:22:15] continue, Lord God, to reveal your
[2:22:18] secrets to us day after day and bring in
[2:22:22] the last ones so we can go home. Father,
[2:22:28] bless your people, I pray. Bless those
[2:22:31] that are streaming, Father, around the
[2:22:33] world. Lord, you know your people. You
[2:22:36] won't miss any. So bless them in a
[2:22:38] mighty way, I pray.
[2:22:41] In Jesus Christ's name we pray and give
[2:22:44] you glory.
[2:22:46] Amen and amen. Hallelujah.
[2:22:50] What song is that?
[2:22:53] He knows my name. Oh, hallelujah.
[2:22:57] Thank you, brother Andrew.
[2:23:00] He knows your name.
[2:23:03] Can you sing that song with a true not
[2:23:07] just I always say it's not how
[2:23:11] well you can sing it.
[2:23:15] It's how sincere you can sing it to our
[2:23:18] Lord Jesus.
[2:23:20] Cuz he knows my name. He knows your
[2:23:23] name.
[2:23:25] He made sure
[2:23:27] it was sealed and at the appointed time
[2:23:30] it was opened. So that's what the
[2:23:33] prophet says. Now the members they see
[2:23:35] their names in the book as the seal has
[2:23:37] been opened. We see our name.
[2:23:41] That's why we give him glory. May God
[2:23:44] richly bless you. If you can sing
[2:23:46] Brother Andrew
[2:23:50] knows my name.
[2:23:53] Every step that I take,
[2:23:58] every move that I make,
[2:24:02] every tear that I cry.
[2:24:07] And he knows my name. When I am
[2:24:11] overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:24:15] I can't see the light of day.
[2:24:20] I know I'll be just fine.
[2:24:25] Cuz he knows my name.
[2:24:30] He counts the stars
[2:24:33] one and all. He knows how much sand is
[2:24:37] on the shore.
[2:24:39] sees every spare platform.
[2:24:48] He made the mountains and the seas.
[2:24:53] He's in control of everything
[2:24:58] of all creatures great and small.
[2:25:03] And he knows my name.
[2:25:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. Every step that I
[2:25:09] take,
[2:25:12] every move that I make,
[2:25:16] every tear that I cry,
[2:25:21] and he knows my name. When I am
[2:25:25] overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:25:29] I can't see the light of day.
[2:25:34] I know I'll be just fine
[2:25:39] cuz he knows my name. I don't know what
[2:25:43] tomorrow may bring.
[2:25:47] I can't tell you what's in store.
[2:25:52] I don't know a lot of things.
[2:26:00] I don't have all the answers to the
[2:26:04] questions you proide.
[2:26:09] But I know whom I have believe
[2:26:15] and he knows my name.
[2:26:19] Every step that I take,
[2:26:24] every move that I make,
[2:26:29] every tear that I cry,
[2:26:33] and he knows my name.
[2:26:37] When I am overwhelmed by the pain,
[2:26:42] can't see the light of day.
[2:26:47] I know I'll be just fine
[2:26:51] when pains of death seized on my soul.
[2:26:57] Unto the Lord I cried
[2:27:02] till Jesus came and he made me whole.
[2:27:08] But I would not be.
[2:27:13] Oh no, I would not be.
[2:27:22] Well, praise God it was Jesus. Well, I
[2:27:25] would not be denied.
[2:27:29] Oh no, I would not be be denied
[2:27:35] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[2:27:41] would not be be denied.
[2:27:45] Oh no, I would not be be denied.
[2:27:51] Oh no, I would not be be denied.
[2:27:57] Till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[2:28:03] would not be be denied
[2:28:08] as Jacob in the days of home. I wrestle
[2:28:15] with the Lord.
[2:28:19] And it's time with a courageous
[2:28:25] when I stood upon God's word.
[2:28:30] Oh no, I would not be be denied.
[2:28:35] For no, I would not be be denied
[2:28:41] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[2:28:48] would not be be denied.
[2:28:52] Well, oh Satan said that my Lord was
[2:28:57] gone and he would not hear my prayer.
[2:29:03] Oh, but let's praise the Lord. The work
[2:29:08] it is done and Christ the Lord is here.
[2:29:14] Oh no, I would not be be denied.
[2:29:20] Oh no, I would not be denied
[2:29:26] till Jesus came and he made me whole. I
[2:29:33] would not be denied.
[2:29:37] Hallelujah. Won't you give the Lord a
[2:29:39] hand clap of praise?
[2:29:41] Amen.
[2:29:43] Amen.
