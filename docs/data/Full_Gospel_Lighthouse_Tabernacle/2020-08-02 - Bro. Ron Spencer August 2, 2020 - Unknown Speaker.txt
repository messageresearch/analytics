[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and there is another little door of pride oh that sure is a great door in the human heart in this 20th century people want to feel like if they're just somebody i just want you to stop a minute and take analysis who are you anyhow do you think the world would stop turning if you died tonight do you think it was weary god or the angels or so forth maybe in two days from now if you're a very important man you'll never be known anymore just among your relations you know how long ago i was standing it i love art and i like to see where the sculptures have made great artistic work and painters and so forth and i was at a certain museum in tennessee and there was a two young man saying they're looking at a a paper that was laying with the little difference of stuff material i'm one of the boys looked at it you turn back to come here john and look at i was looking over the boy's shoulders reading i was given the analysis of a male which is more valuable in weight and so forth than the female and a man weighing 150 pounds you know what he's worth 84 cents and then you'll put a hundred dollars to a 50 hat on your 84 cents and some of your women will take a five hundred dollar mentor and go to church on easter morning with a little certain body sticking up with your nose doesn't have any rain it will drown you and then what are you worth 84 cents oh you think you're pretty but remember thou cometh spain you may be pretty but you'll be nothing but the skin worms will crawl in and out of that flesh and maybe by this time next week it'll be doing that you know what i mean oh you say mr graham i'm going to face you here in the city somebody else will take your place you'll be forgotten when the worms are eating you up and this certain boy said he heard he said sean we're not worth very much are we so don't look like we are we'd have to wait 150 pounds to be worth 84 cents so they were standing there and i tapped them on the shoulder i said boys pardon me just a minute i said i was looking to it that's because i remained i said i'm under 150 pounds but i said there's just one thing i wanted to tell you that this you may not even be worth 84 in chemicals with your body just enough all white wash just frankly hence nests and a little bit of polyester and so forth you might not be worth 84 cents but you've got to soar into this work 10 million worlds [Music] and the good thing about it friends is think of this before we get to this kingdom before

our sins and tell us how to get straightened up and what we've done in life and what we're doing it's the holy spirit jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the king that shall come

one's permanent forever it looks like and making some attachments and so and so we got our picture taken this morning in front of the house this morning and just honored to have them with them i i was thinking as i was coming down the road and i look across this audience i'm thankful to have young people in this day [Applause] in this day that have a desire to be in the house of the lord and and to love god with all of their heart and this is where they want to be they want to be here and we thank the lord for that hallelujah amen amen i had a wonderful card and a gift from sister whitney holmes

isn't that wonderful that god is just so great to us and we so love him with all of our heart please make these guys feel welcome they they love you they want to be here with you and so we certainly are very thrilled to have them here this is just special i'd like to share this with you just before we go to the word brother jason uh he he he sent me some pictures of a family's house uh this this bible actually came from this church and in in one of his family members house that is now vacant they literally had trashed that house he sent me pictures trying to get me a little bit of the thought of it but they had destroyed that house and i pray for you guys that you can you can make a new again yeah you can do all that you make it new but this is an older bible but there's something about the word of god it just preserves it was laying in this house and it was just totally demolished the house was totally demolished but god's word was just totally totally preserved if this bible is found please return it to homer frazier oh yeah i found another name in this bible you know anything about this i think this is even going to be more special to you miss ms deborah watson 49 whipperwill waynesboro virginia that probably had to be how long have you been married uh-oh oh yeah god knows how to preserve it donny he just absolutely knows how to preserve it hallelujah to god be the glory amen he preserves you too amen amen i presume it was brother fred yeah yeah god bless that bible amen got a lot of special names in it we love you with all of our hearts and we we boy i enjoyed last night amen amen i i want to announce to you as an audience as our as our audience sometimes you just have to begin to do things even in the in the uh when the storms are rough so so this is the way we're going to begin to do things i'm not a survivor of cancer i'm an overcomer and i i i'm like bartimaeus i once was blind but i'm not blind no more and so i once had cancer but don't have it no more so we're just going to move forward and amen so if we could do that [Applause] [Music] and so i want to i want to read i want to read something that that was inspired to me in december and i want to bring it up to date i've been sick before but i made it i've been broke before but i made it i've been brokenhearted before i made it i cried all night but i made it i've been betrayed but i made it i've been lied on but i made it i've been destitute but i made it i've been rejected but i made it and i would say at the end of that charge amen amen god bless you if you will turn with me to joshua chapter one i would like to i don't know if there has been a testimony given of sister sarah and sister teresa but god just worked a wonderful testimony for them to wear that they had a wash machine that was was a washing machine it was going nuts and they found it two foot of water out on their porch area and sparks were flying and and they were both getting shocked i bet there was some screaming in that house and god provided two men working that have had but plumber and electrician literally working a hundred feet from their house and those men came and took care of the whole problem amen don't tell me god won't provide in your battle amen amen joshua chapter 1 and verse 5 and there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life god is saying this not his favorite preacher god is saying this as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for unto this people shalt thou provide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them may the lord bless the reading of his word today you may be seated brother branham says in in from the beginning it wasn't so he said then today they they have the nerve to say we where wonder what happened to the to the god of the bible where is that god why you have choked him out by your creeds and choked him out by your traditions and and we tried to place him back in history he is a god of history and he's waiting today on today that that same god of history that when moses called on him at the red sea the god of history rose and made a way when joshua called on the god of history he said god he said he rose up and made a way when daniel called on him in a fiery furnace he made a way or in the lion's den he said the hebrew children he said he made a way he's still the same god of history how many believes that he's still that same god he's the same he's the same god of history he's waiting for his people how many of his people are here this morning he's waiting for his people to call him out of history that godfrey still remains god he's god forever but our traditions we've taught it away from the people what we must do is bring back that living faith to a people bring god back that's a 1959 quote this church has seen god a living god we've seen him do almost every major miracle that you can find we've seen him in phenomenal situations i love last night god loves to put his war armor on for his children he said oh how the church ought to to look this morning to find the spirit working amongst the people if you want a church home that the spirit that's raised christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move amongst the people that's the spirit that's the spirit that god is raised up in the last days to take a people over into the other land into the full promise of all the blessings of god to the commission that he gave the promise the is unto you and to your children as israel sought for that promised land knowing that it was somewhere because there had been somebody there before so is the church we know that there's a land somewhere there's a power somewhere because that's been oh others over there we know that land lays beyond the river where we're headed towards this morning trying to go to that promised land joshua knew that that land was there and he went first and found out and he come back as a witness god called ministers ought not to have to be so stuffed and so full of theology but have it to visit the land to where we're going and bring back the evidence of the divine love and the power of jesus christ to make known to their congregations that there is a land beyond the river hallelujah hallelujah aaron oglesby preached a sermon the other day and he i'd just like to just give a couple notes of highlights he is brother tim pruitt's son-in-law he is the one that was standing in the room when we had the vision of of little isaac and these are some of the statements and i thought it would be a blessing to you in one moment your whole world can be flipped upside down in in moment in one moment things can be fine and then one moment your world can be in utter chaos the enemy has hit you like a blitz he come he come from nowhere and you didn't see it coming everything was going good and you're serving the lord and everything is good and then bam where did it come from what is the lord but he says i've got some good news for you are you ready for good news there's not that's not the only way it works one moment in his presence one moment in his presence can fix everything that the enemy can ever think about doing that ought to bring a smile to your face one moment one moment in his pr in his presence can take death sentence and turn it into new life one moment in his presence can take the worst attack from the enemy and turn it into the greatest testimony for the glory of the kingdom of god just one moment in his presence is all it takes one moment can change everything forever hallelujah and there's no going back hallelujah bartimaeus was healed the blindness left him and he wasn't going to relive those days over again when you become a christian in your life and the grace of god is bestowed on your life and something becomes alive and it becomes surreal to you god found many of you with very stained lives many children of god come to god in deep trouble we once were drug addicts or we once were religious so we we once had a very stained past but when god rich in mercy and the blood of jesus christ washed our lives and took those desires away we're not going back [Applause] come on church we don't have to count the days to keep ourselves you know in line this is how long we've been sober or this is how long i haven't had drugs or this is how long i haven't done any pornography we met god and god changed your lives and we're not that man no longer so don't identify me as that man [Applause] hallelujah remember our god is still the god of elijah he's still the same god as he ever was he is the same god he moves in the same cycle he does the same things he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah now remember in the midst of all this cry god cannot send a revival until he's got men in shape to take it we cannot have a revival until we got men god called men god trained men that's not afraid not afraid not trained up in some schools of theology or education but rugged men of faith god has brought them up in a school of rugged training men who are not afraid to face the fire men who has come into the presence of god who knows his power knows his omnipotence knows his healing some man that's been trained to know the living god it's all right to train them by the word but the letter killeth but the spirit giveth love and before we can have a revival god has to call men and trained and god trained men to carry this message oh glory to god they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go into the fiery furnace in defeat or a lion's den or whatever it may be they're ready to go because they've been in the presence of god they know what he is whether it's to victory or defeat they can still stand in the same that's the same the training that god does to men and it's just very strange to think that god would do that that god trains his men like that but he does some through the waters sunk through the floods some through deep trials but all through the blood god leads his men through great trials to purge them and sometimes it takes years to do it and as for myself i believe that right now that god is training such men to meet the front line men who are going through and time shook from their feet he says sometimes like the whole thing is falling but yet in the midst of it all they know that there's a living god oh hallelujah now notice this notice this grab a hold of it i'm grabbing a hold of it you grab a hold of it god's given every sick person in here divine healing jesus was wounded for your transgressions with his stripes we are healed it's yours but you'll have to fight for every inch that you possess are you with me who are you at war with the enemy we'd like to pull it away from you you're going to have to fight for it everywhere the souls of your feet travel god told joshua i've given it to you footprints means possessions let it move on tonight foot princess possession let's take every inch of ground that god has given to us are you with me now now remember god has counted you worthy when you have to go through a test don't fail this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god has found you found favor with god god believes that you'll stand the test i don't know about you but i believe i could do some running because you can read a lot of names in the bible they stood the test but somebody is going to stand the test in this day [Applause] are you with me now i was thinking about you and i was reading this quote brother nathaniel he works in uva for those that will watch he works in uva he's on the coveted floor with at uva he's a icu nurse there and he said he noticed that when he laid his hands on them they would get better now let me just say this to you it's not just to the preacher standing in a pulpit but here is a man that that recognized in the midst of all of the chaos of this world that is going on when i lay my hands on them not having to say prayers and all different kinds of things but when he laid his hands on him are you with me can we can we take our footprints of possession and realize who we are whether you work in a bank or whether you work on construction let me just say god's with you he's watching over you you are his hands you are his feet you are his eyes hallelujah satan said oh sure he gets everything he asks for talking about job let me just go back he said job said oh yes i have seen job down there and god said he's a perfect servant there's none like him in the earth there's nobody like job he's a perfect man he's my pride and joy i like it god's got favorites too and satan said oh sure he he he he he gets everything that he asked for but let me have him once and i'll make him curse you to your face i'll make him curse you and god said he's in your hands but don't you take his life god had confidence in joke now let me just make something clear here it wasn't confidence in his dna flesh it was confidence in what god deposited on the inside so god's got confidence in himself or our glory how can we fail when god has confidence in himself of what he deposited he's able to take care of it when it looks like everything has gone wrong god's given you a trial he's got confidence he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant you're a real christian god's given you a test see what you'll do about it he said these fiery trials he says he said why count it all joy it's more precious than gold i want you to say that tonight my trials is more precious than gold he conquered sickness he conquered temptations when the enemy spit in his face and smote his jaw he turned the other side when they jerked his beard from his face and they spit on him he never revealed back he conquered the gate of temptation and took it when jesus conquered all of that he conquered that not only for himself but he conquered it for you but the brown said what an assurance of the solid rock the resurrection of our blessed lord he said nothing can destroy it glory to god it has been planted it is the seed of god it is the purpose of god to give us the blessed holy spirit it is the purpose of god to show us signs and wonders and miracles it's the purpose of god that nothing can destroy it all hell may wager against it but it will prevail we have god's eternal promise there may be teachers and isms rise they may be great programs rise there may be things that look like it would be destroyed but it can never be destroyed it is the purpose of god to see that it will prevail it's not up to me it's not up to you oh this will preach brother danny it's not up to me and you to see whether it'll be saved or not it's up to god heavens and earth will pass away but this word and if i'm in that word and the attributes of god is on the inside of me there's nothing hallelujah now i want to say this to you that's almost like cheatin yeah it's almost like cheating because you possess it all and there's nothing can destroy you if you really believe that and you can't fail is this microphone working you ought to just tell the devil i can't fail oh brother ron but i i'm just trying to hold on hey you're doing the wrong thing he's holding on to you it ain't you that's got him it's he that's got you [Applause] hallelujah god is worth no more than his word but and if his word is no good then he is no good and if i can't put confidence in what he said he said you're no good but you're as good as your word is and god is as good as his word is yes and i as a christian believer i believe that the bible is inspired i believe it is written by the holy spirit and it is infallible word of god and god is under obligation to his word and to the believer that will accept it and any word is his seed and if you accept it in your heart by faith and believe it and confess it god will bring it to pass you've heard me read this quote a thousand times but one more is going to help prayer changes things prayer is the most powerful weapon that has ever been put in control of human beings there's no atomic bomb hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer let me explain something to you prayer is when a believer is talking directly to god there's no high priest in between no no no favorite preacher in between that's going to elect whether you get it done or not you're talking to god and he is our faithful high priest he is the intercessor of our prayers there's not a prayer too big and there's not a prayer too small his eyes is on the sparrow and i know that he's watching over you [Applause] if you get in a spot to where that you feel like the heavens has turned brass that means ever come to that spot i'm coming to an end here this morning but how many has ever come to a spot to where it felt like your prayers was not going past the ceiling it's kind of like preaching sometimes and your sermon goes out and he goes but you're praying and it just seems like hey nobody's listening so what you do i'll tell you a secret what you do is go back and start thanking him for the things that he's done in the past and start rejoicing in what he did and have a have a situation to where that word david was talking to saul and he was on his way to take care of goliath and so he just started telling testimonies he was telling testimonies on his way to get to goliath brother branham would stand in the pulpit and he'd start telling testimonies of georgia carter and he are telling testimonies of brother uh brother congressman upshaw and it began boom boom boom boom boom boom boom bombay mexico the dead baby and just boom boom boom boom boom and he would tell them testimonies that would cause them devils to get nervous so the sky that's been over top of you trying to keep your prayers from going through all of a sudden they start shaking and your prayers will get sick through one of those cracks hallelujah don't you love the lord now remember remember you're the most powerful people on the earth said it in washington they think they're the most powerful in geneva they think they're the most powerful but really the most powerful people on earth are sitting in a building like this those are connected this morning your living room becomes a very powerful place the halls of congress can act because of your prayer they can't shut these churches down because of your prayer they can't keep you from coming to church because of your prayers are you with me you see covet 19 might work for a little while but it won't last forever because of your prayers [Applause] brother branham said satan may pin you on a corner with cancer god will make a way of escape satan may pin you down under a car god will make a way of escape satan may take your family away from you but god will make a way of escape he is the god that makes a way of escape for you when i was a boy and god was pulling me back toward him i was found in a very difficult spot in life and i prayed a prayer as a wretched sinner i prayed a prayer god if you will make a way of escape for me i'll walk out of the door and never look back let me just say within 24 hours my whole world was different and i was set on a chartered course to stand in this pulpit today from that 24-hour escape god will make a way of escape for you are you with me i want to share one more story and i don't have all the details and don't pretend to have all the details last weekend brother ed hammermeister and their church hosted andrew and myself by video which we had played we had preached here a couple of weeks before that and we'd kept it offline so it'd be fresh to them but we wanted to make sure that all the technicals was worked out to where it could be fresh for them and and be right brother ed hammermeister's grandmother was escaping in the time of war in in the germany area and i don't have the exact town where they were at but they were escaping i think this might be world war one and they were escaping by foot on foot and she was alone and she had many children and in that escape she was making this journey and you know journeys sometimes have great harrowing details and here she is trying to provide for these children and she's trying to make a way to get away from the war kind of an exile and kind of moving out of this war region and they would travel for months literally months on their feet traveling to get away from the war one night she had all of her children in a barn they were all snuggled in the barn and she got them all asleep and god spoke to her during the night move your children and move them immediately and she began to move her children and i think it was i think it was many children that she moved and she moved him and when the last one was moved out a bomb hit that barn god made a way of escape as they were walking they were walking in the line and they came to a certain spot to where as they gathered with other people one of the little girls got separated she was separated four years four years one day god rich in his mercy that little girl came back into their life and it was just simple following and and got me home behind the wrong people and god made a way of escape for that little girl for four years let me just tell you god intake he knows how to take care of us he knows how to take care of us in a war he knows how to take care of us in in very horrible situations and this morning i've got a word for you if you think that your life is too difficult put your life into the hands of god and say god my life is yours i don't know particularly how that you're going to get me out of this but my place my life into your hands let's stand to our

important it was when i gave a thousand i learned how important it was and god was blessing when he gave a quarter and he was blessing when i gave a hundred and he was blessing when i gave a thousand what will he do when the children of god oh hallelujah gonna cut loose of everything i'm not talking about your money this morning i'm talking about when you go to cut and lose all the things that you're withholding from him when the woman took all that she had and spent everything she had to get that alabaster box she wasn't willing to take some of it back home with her she broke everything
