[0:37] [Music]
[1:07] god bless you I would like to speak to
[1:10] you tonight on the hurt will not stop
[1:14] the music if it will turn with me to
[1:18] Isaiah chapter 65 and verse 16 this
[1:22] evening
[1:28] a man Isaiah chapter 65 in verse 16 that
[1:43] who he who blessed himself in the earth
[1:48] shall bless himself in the God of the
[1:51] truth and he that sweareth in the earth
[1:54] shall swear in the God of truth because
[1:57] the former troubles are forgotten and
[2:01] because they are hid from mine eyes for
[2:07] behold I create a new heavens and a new
[2:09] earth and the former shall not be
[2:13] remembered nor come into mind but be
[2:17] glad and rejoice forever in that which I
[2:20] create for behold I create Jerusalem of
[2:24] rejoicing and her people of joy and I
[2:28] will rejoice in Jerusalem and enjoy and
[2:31] my people and the voice of weeping shall
[2:34] no more be heard in her nor the voice of
[2:38] crime I'm gonna tell you I'm trying to
[2:40] behave here while I read the scripture
[2:42] and there shall be no more thence an
[2:45] infant of days nor an old man that hath
[2:48] not filled these days for the child
[2:51] shall shall die a hundred years old but
[2:54] the sinner being a hundred years old
[2:56] shall be accursed and they shall build
[2:58] houses and inhabit them and they shall
[3:00] plant vineyards and eat the fruit of
[3:03] them and they shall not build an another
[3:06] inhabit and they shall not plant in
[3:08] another eat for the days of the tree are
[3:11] the days of my people in mine elect
[3:13] shall long enjoy the work of their hands
[3:16] and they shall not labor in vain nor
[3:19] bring forth for trouble for they are the
[3:22] seed of the bless of the Lord and their
[3:25] offspring with them and it shall come to
[3:27] pass that before they call I will answer
[3:31] and while they are yet speaking I will
[3:34] hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed
[3:37] together the lion shall eat straw like
[3:40] the bull
[3:41] and the dust shall be the Serpent's meat
[3:43] and they shall not hurt nor destroy in
[3:46] all my holy mount saith the Lord
[3:51] revelations chapter 19 and verse 6 and I
[3:56] heard as it were a voice of a great
[3:58] multitude a great a voice of many waters
[4:01] a voice of mighty thunderings saying
[4:05] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[4:08] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[4:12] give honour to him for the marriage of
[4:14] the lamb has come and his wife has made
[4:17] herself ready and to her was granted
[4:20] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[4:22] clean and white for the fine linen is
[4:25] the righteousness of the saint and he
[4:28] saith them to me right they blessed are
[4:32] they which are called to the marriage
[4:34] supper of the lamb and he said unto me

[5:48] you may be seated revelations 21
[5:52] verse one is very familiar to you and I
[5:55] saw a new heaven and a new earth for the
[5:58] first heaven and the first Earth were
[6:00] passed away and there was no more sea
[6:03] and I John saw the holy city the New
[6:06] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[6:08] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[6:12] her husband and I heard a great voice
[6:14] out of heaven saying behold the
[6:16] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[6:20] will dwell with them and they shall be
[6:23] his people and God himself shall be with
[6:26] them and be their God now love these
[6:30] words and God shall wipe away all tears
[6:35] can you say those two words with me from
[6:41] their eyes and there shall be no more
[6:43] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[6:53] shall there be any more pain for the
[6:56] former things are passed away and he
[6:59] that set up on the throne said behold I
[7:01] make all things new and he that said
[7:06] unto me write for these words are true
[7:09] and faithful brother Branham is speaking
[7:13] in the Easter message in in and the
[7:16] cease preach and the sermon I know and
[7:20] it makes a quotation I want to share
[7:22] with you why this God let troubles come
[7:31] does anyone in this building ever had
[7:33] some trouble
[7:35] why does God let troubles come god
[7:39] harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth
[7:44] and makes it obey him those troubles
[7:48] bring us closer fellowship with God but
[7:56] the man said what was it he said of the
[7:59] Son of God 1900 and some years ago this
[8:02] afternoon
[8:03] he was led from prison he was taken from
[8:06] the judgments eaten from there to the
[8:08] Hall of scourging from there up gall
[8:11] Gotha pulled up a hill Simon saw reme
[8:13] helping him bury the cross and dare he
[8:15] died Oh Rock of Ages with his blood beat
[8:19] out of him his body stripped hallelujah
[8:21] he said great big gobs of a mocking
[8:25] soldiers spit upon his face and he said
[8:27] if my kingdom was of this world I'd ask
[8:30] my father and he would he would give me
[8:32] legions of angels that would come and
[8:34] fight for me but this is not my kingdom
[8:38] but my kingdom come are you with me now
[8:42] thy kingdom come Thy will be done and it
[8:53] will be here pretty soon
[8:55] thy kingdom come Thy will be done when
[9:00] Billy suddenly said one time that in
[9:02] every tree said an angel he just put
[9:06] your hand loosen just point your finger
[9:09] that's all you have to do and we'll
[9:11] settle this question down here he said
[9:15] my debt the truth Caiaphas's look mine
[9:18] said he saved others but himself he
[9:22] cannot save it was the greatest
[9:26] compliment that was ever paid him
[9:31] if he saved himself he can't save others
[9:37] so he gave his life that he could save
[9:41] others oh ma oh we like sheep it's gonna
[9:48] slay and God laid upon him the iniquity
[9:51] of us all he was led to a slaughter like
[9:55] a sheep and led like a sheep dumb before
[9:58] her Shearer's open not his mouth yet he
[10:01] was wounded for our transgressions
[10:03] bruised for our iniquities the
[10:06] chastisement of our peace was on him
[10:08] upon him and with His stripes we are
[10:11] healed how could you reject such a Maxis
[10:14] love to see him and there he go
[10:17] staggering up a hillside poor little
[10:19] weak frail body bending beneath the load
[10:22] I think of that point that set there
[10:25] that day and he caught a glimpse of it
[10:26] and he wrote mid rendering rocks and
[10:29] darkening sky my Saviour bowed his head
[10:33] and died the open veil revealed a way to
[10:37] heavens Joy's in endless days what a
[10:41] savior how could we how could i reject
[10:47] such matchless love who would do that
[10:51] for me who would do that for you he said
[11:02] if we could only just prefigure a
[11:04] picture turn our camera now one morning
[11:07] down in jerusalem i listened in the
[11:10] window and i hear of noise what is it
[11:13] it's a priest saying away with such a
[11:16] man I can hear a little woman run to the
[11:19] front of the crowd and say what has he
[11:22] done what has he done but but heal the
[11:25] sick and and raised the dead and and
[11:28] brought delivers to those that were in
[11:31] captive the big cruel hand would smack
[11:35] her in the mouth and say would you
[11:37] listen to that woman instead of your
[11:39] priest of
[11:40] cruel Roman whip beating him it's kind
[11:43] of an awful picture but let's raise it
[11:46] to the shades and look I hear something
[11:48] bumping down the street over the
[11:50] cobblestone and a look out the wind and
[11:52] I see a little man with a white robe who
[11:55] wove throughout without seams laying
[11:58] across his shoulders packing the old
[12:01] crosses it bumps down the street his
[12:03] shoulders they're rubbing wrong and I
[12:06] notice a little garment there's little
[12:07] spots all over it those little swatches
[12:10] he goes up the hill they begin to get
[12:11] bigger and bigger and while they all run
[12:15] into one now a great big bloody splash
[12:18] across his legs
[12:19] that's second Adam the seed of the woman
[12:27] that be of death humming around his head
[12:30] and there he goes up the hill knowing
[12:33] that soon that devil will certainly had
[12:36] the wool pulled over his eyes there the
[12:38] devil said I'm kind of man that claims
[12:42] to be God how could he I challenged him
[12:45] to do a stunner one of these tricks in
[12:47] front of me and turned him into Brad
[12:49] rocks into Brandon he failed to do it
[12:54] how could he stand if I if I if I be a
[12:57] prophet and let a Roman soldier put a
[13:00] rag around his face and and and hit him
[13:03] on the head with a stick and now if
[13:05] you're a prophet tell us who hit you and
[13:10] he said still he's a faker I'll come and
[13:19] sting him with my sting of death and
[13:21] I'll get him now oh how he failed when
[13:25] he hung him on the cross and that bee
[13:27] was humming humming around him if that
[13:30] bee or that insect of that stinger ever
[13:32] slings and anchors that stinger deep
[13:34] when it goes way down that stinger ever
[13:37] gets again he'll never sting again he
[13:41] leaves his finger in the flesh death
[13:43] could sting a sinner and get by with it
[13:48] that time he let his stinger into him
[13:50] Manuel's flesh and Emanuel pulled the
[13:55] Stinger out of him
[13:57] no wonder Saint Paul could say years
[14:00] after that when that bee of death was
[14:02] coming around him Oh death worse your
[14:04] steak grave worship victory but thanks
[14:10] be to God and giveth us the victory to
[14:12] the Lord Jesus Christ death was
[14:16] conquered that he can hell around that
[14:20] beacon Baucis saying I got you but we
[14:26] can point over yonder to an empty grave
[14:28] and say thanks be to God that gives us
[14:30] the victory through the Lord Jesus
[14:33] Christ he can make a noise but as long
[14:39] as he's stinging you he ain't got no
[14:41] more stinger when he anchored his
[14:44] stinger in the flesh of Emanuel God's
[14:47] flesh among us it pulled the stinger out
[14:52] of death and that's God's idea of his
[14:57] first conference so Jesus would be sent
[15:04] to the earth to feel hurt Paul would say
[15:11] it like this for though I would desire
[15:15] to glory I shall not be a fool for I
[15:21] will say the truth but now I forbear
[15:24] lest any man should think about me of
[15:28] which he seeth me to be or heareth of me
[15:30] unless I should get exalted above
[15:32] measure this is a Messenger of God that
[15:36] will write your New Testament
[15:39] unless I be exalted above measure the
[15:43] the revelations there was given to me a
[15:45] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[15:49] Satan to buffett me lest I should get
[15:52] exalted above measure
[15:57] you're talking about operating and
[16:00] dimensions a Messenger of God that would
[16:05] detail the writing of the Scriptures all
[16:09] the way from the book of Romans all the
[16:11] way through and even in that humanity
[16:17] confess lest I get exalted and think
[16:23] myself something great
[16:26] are you with me God allowed a messenger
[16:31] of Satan to perfectly but it means time
[16:36] after time after time struggling and
[16:42] that enemy comes to destroy he gets an
[16:45] opportunity to destroy and to hurt and
[16:48] to mangle listen Satan's nobody to
[16:51] negotiate with he's nobody to negotiate
[16:56] with he feeds on his own meat he feeds
[16:59] on his own people and now he's allowed
[17:03] to to work on that piece of flesh a
[17:06] pause and it would come it would come
[17:11] and it would come over and over again
[17:18] now notice this you might be like Paul
[17:22] for a moment for this thing I besought
[17:26] the Lord thrice I would say he's a man
[17:32] of authority I chase walking in special
[17:35] places in this condition that kept
[17:38] coming to him this messenger of the
[17:41] devil that kept coming this thing that
[17:44] just kept coming he besought the Lord
[17:47] thrice that it might depart from me and
[17:53] he said unto me this is God's response
[17:56] to him my grace
[17:59] oh this a grace won't take you where he
[18:07] can't keep you hallelujah
[18:11] it's the amazing grace of God let me
[18:15] just say this you know man holds himself
[18:19] no man holds himself it's the amazing
[18:23] grace of Almighty God that protects us
[18:29] the unmerited favor of God God said my
[18:37] grace is sufficient for my strength is
[18:42] made perfect in weakness most gladly
[18:45] therefore I will rather glory in mine
[18:48] infirmities that the power of Christ may
[18:52] rest upon me if I gotta have infirmities
[18:55] I won't trade infirmities for the lack
[18:59] of God
[19:00] I gotta have him I want you to know this
[19:04] God can operate without me but you can't
[19:11] operate without him
[19:21] are you with me oh brother on I'm too
[19:25] big visit a graveyard in that graveyard
[19:36] its judges lawyers doctors paupers
[19:44] matters a little bit of difference
[19:46] between the gravestones has different
[19:50] sayings on it but it's all the same
[19:53] results because of Adam's fall because
[19:58] of Adam's fall that is the result but
[20:03] because of God's amazing grace
[20:06] that's not our end come on church I'm
[20:13] glad that this mortal life however long
[20:17] it will be it's like a vapor for a short
[20:19] time it appears a little wild then it's
[20:22] gone you live to be a hundred years old
[20:27] she's gone Christine is getting ready to
[20:32] turn 98 sister Nancy's mother 90 years 8
[20:36] years old but let me just say in this
[20:38] pants of eternity that's nothing that's
[20:44] absolutely nothing god I'd rather have
[20:53] Jesus than anything
[20:59] Peter would write it like this that the
[21:03] trial of your faith understand this it's
[21:09] not the trial of God's faith
[21:14] it's the trying of your faith
[21:19] just remember this you are what you are
[21:22] in depression the trying of your faith
[21:27] being much more precious than gold that
[21:30] perisheth that though it be tried with
[21:33] fire might be found unto praise and
[21:35] honor and glory unto the appearing of
[21:38] Jesus Christ job 23 and verse 10 but he
[21:42] knoweth the way that I take and when he
[21:45] had tried me I shall come forth as gold
[21:55] let me to say this year the book of Job
[21:58] is like like a a sound of an orchestra
[22:01] music every one of our lives is going to
[22:06] play out in this span of time none of us
[22:08] has ever been through what job's been
[22:10] through I know you could hurt people you
[22:13] just dare not tell us people how some of
[22:15] people are doing because if you're not
[22:17] careful an hour goes by and they have
[22:20] any got to the good part yet I generally
[22:28] don't have a lot of time for that but I
[22:30] kind of move along but let me just say
[22:33] this is nobody's had a roughest time as
[22:35] Joe are you with me and God knowing when
[22:42] he came to earth or what they were going
[22:44] to do for him he wrote it in the
[22:47] scriptures wounded for our
[22:51] transgressions bruised for our
[22:54] iniquities the chastisement of his peace
[22:57] was upon him he knew what Rome would do
[23:00] to him but he came anyway
[23:06] he came anyway he became a man do you
[23:14] think that those words are Beyonc
[23:16] involving an illegitimate child and
[23:19] those difficult words that he had to
[23:21] hear because he had to overcome
[23:24] everything that you've got to overcome
[23:27] some people say well I've never nobody
[23:29] has ever had it as bad as I have that's
[23:31] because you're using just a mirror
[23:35] you're only using a mirror if you can
[23:38] over gathered it over yourself that's a
[23:43] lot of people's got self itis and that
[23:47] self itis just absorbs them and consumes
[23:51] them they'll never do nobody else no
[23:53] good because self itis are you anything
[24:01] second Corinthians chapter four and
[24:03] verse eight we're troubled on every side
[24:09] so you're in good company yet not
[24:13] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[24:18] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[24:23] down not destroyed always bearing about
[24:29] in the body of the dying of the Lord
[24:31] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[24:33] be manifested in our body for we which
[24:37] are all ladel ever to the death of Jesus
[24:40] sake that the life also of Jesus might
[24:43] be manifest in our mortal flesh so then
[24:46] death worketh in US but life in you and
[24:49] we haven't the same faith spirit of
[24:52] faith according as it is written I
[24:55] believed and therefore have I spoken and
[25:00] we also believe and therefore speak
[25:09] are you with me
[25:11] brother branham said there had been no
[25:13] rainbow until first the flood came and
[25:18] Noah was pressed into that condition
[25:20] that he was in to float forty days and
[25:23] night in a storm in a little arm
[25:26] pitching up and down in the water and it
[25:29] was after the flood was all over that he
[25:32] saw a rainbow for the first time the
[25:36] Covenant of Hope the Covenant of Hope
[25:42] the Covenant of promise after he went
[25:47] through tribulation it was then he saw
[25:51] the promise
[25:55] sometimes the strains of our humanity's
[25:58] almost more than we can bear I'm
[26:01] reminded about a little boy that I've
[26:03] told you about before but I want to
[26:05] share it one more time with you his name
[26:07] was Glenn Cunningham Glenn Cunningham
[26:11] when he was a young man he was burned up
[26:13] he was burned by a cook stove fire and
[26:18] the fire came out on him and burned his
[26:21] bundi slat and burned his legs and it
[26:25] burned him to the point - when they took
[26:27] him to the doctors the doctor said we
[26:30] must cut his legs off they'll never be
[26:32] any good he pleaded with him and he let
[26:36] me keep my legs let me keep my legs he
[26:38] was just a boy let me keep my legs they
[26:44] take him home
[26:47] we understand we now understand the
[26:51] intensity of fires and damage but this
[26:55] boy had came to a spot to word that he
[26:57] couldn't use his legs anymore he looked
[27:01] like he was going to be in a wheelchair
[27:02] forever they'd push him out on the front
[27:07] up on the front porch and he'd sit and
[27:09] watch all the children go by after a
[27:12] while he got himself down - there was a
[27:14] picket fence he goes there day after day
[27:17] to watch the children
[27:19] go by what a moment it would be that he
[27:25] would reach out and grab a hold of the
[27:28] Finch grab ahold of those pickets and
[27:32] pull himself up for the first time and
[27:37] stand upon those legs that he hadn't
[27:39] been able to use in quite a long time
[27:41] and he stood himself up held on for a
[27:47] bit
[27:48] day after day he'd go out and pull
[27:50] himself up one day he he took a step and
[27:56] he started moving down the the pickax
[27:58] and he wouldn't take another step and
[28:00] he'd start moving down the biscuits
[28:02] nobody was watching but he was sometimes
[28:06] indeed since side of him all of the hurt
[28:11] that had came to his body he was
[28:14] determined that it would not consume him
[28:19] are you with me now you got to come to a
[28:21] spot that yes I've had to go through
[28:24] some earth and yes I've had to go
[28:26] through some tough times but I will not
[28:29] let that define me
[28:33] [Applause]
[28:43] couldn't begin to go backwards and
[28:45] forwards on that fence and after a while
[28:47] he began to take steps on his own
[28:49] without heaven and it wasn't long until
[28:53] Glenn began to walk on his own but he
[28:56] was not satisfied with walking
[28:58] he wanted to run he begin to run scars
[29:04] you know he begun to run all the hurt
[29:10] and the pain that was continuous he
[29:14] continued to run Glenn would become one
[29:20] of the fastest athletes in the entire
[29:23] world and he became the first man to
[29:27] approach a four-minute mile and he
[29:31] became the world's fastest man at that
[29:34] time Paul would say it like this I've
[29:47] been beaten I've been shipwrecked he
[29:52] would give it an incredible list but do
[29:56] you know that he said I'm not quick
[30:06] but the random had a lot of things said
[30:07] about him in his life lot of damage was
[30:10] told about him and in his life and
[30:14] critics told a lot of things about him
[30:17] as a young man he was a bootleggers son
[30:21] he was poor while he was the only man
[30:25] that would have a testimony that I met
[30:29] an angel an angel indicated he said
[30:33] about six foot tall dark complected and
[30:40] he stood alone on a lot of those pulpits
[30:43] he became known as the man with the
[30:46] angel and he stood there night after
[30:49] night and the tough cases would come to
[30:51] him to be prayed for and he would make
[30:54] challenges bring me the toughest case
[30:56] that you have there would be spots to
[31:00] where brother Brandon would pray for an
[31:02] individual and they'd pray for him again
[31:04] and I did pray for him again I did pray
[31:06] for him again
[31:07] on one occasion after praying the
[31:10] Sabbath time he reminded the devil come
[31:18] out of church so the next time you hear
[31:22] a critic of the prophet of God take him
[31:24] back to this prayer all of his hurt
[31:28] didn't stop the music come on you're not
[31:36] the only one that's been on attack in

[32:06] that's off all right
[32:08] I don't want to get a sick I got a big
[32:11] job this week he told Satan after after
[32:22] the seven time he said I was
[32:24] commissioned by an angel of the Lord and
[32:34] brother John
[32:35] he knew the devil knew let's just get
[32:43] right down to the spot he knew the devil
[32:46] knew come on
[32:49] why didn't say to make a big challenge
[32:50] then the devil knew that he's had an
[32:54] angel in the cave come on church the
[32:59] devil can whisper in your ear all he
[33:01] wants to that you're backslidden you're
[33:03] a lot of Christian but he knows what you
[33:05] got cuz every morning when you roll out
[33:09] of bed in the morning
[33:11] he knows that you can destroy his
[33:13] kingdom he knows he knows oh I feel like
[33:22] preaching he knows he knows his kingdoms
[33:27] coming down
[33:28] he knows he's only got a short time to
[33:30] work he knows you're the bride of Jesus
[33:33] Christ he knows
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:50] brother branham would talk about a lady
[33:52] that was a that was a songwriter
[34:03] her name was Fanny Crosby she became
[34:08] blind as a child she was a woman that
[34:15] would be used by man named moody other
[34:21] great ministers would actually be able
[34:23] to use her gift to be able to preach
[34:26] openly in the streets and to attract
[34:28] huge crowds born blind lived in total
[34:35] poverty I would say that every person in
[34:39] this building today is much better off
[34:40] financially than she was but she refused
[34:45] to sing songs with national pride and
[34:50] for the days of war she refused to sell
[34:54] songs for for her for things like the
[34:58] country music of that day and they
[35:00] offered her incredible money just to
[35:02] write those songs let me just say this
[35:05] you Satan will make you an offer
[35:09] he'll make you a lot of offers in your
[35:12] life maybe it's a job and maybe it's an
[35:15] education or maybe it's a man or a woman
[35:20] how foolish it is to sell your your
[35:23] birthright before I go any further I was
[35:32] on a plane with a man that was a
[35:34] musician he's a quite famous musician we
[35:38] were sitting and he and his wife was
[35:40] said in the plane Minh and they were
[35:43] sitting beside of me and they was asking
[35:45] me where I was going I was on the trip
[35:47] to China and so he said I'm just coming
[35:50] I'm just coming for a boat trip from the
[35:53] Caribbean I've been on five different
[35:55] cruises and we're just we're just making
[35:57] her way home and so that was the time
[36:01] when the man that was named
[36:04] had just died and he said you're a
[36:09] preacher so you'll understand anointing
[36:13] and he said you see that man named
[36:17] Prince was like many many many preachers
[36:23] said you have to sell yourself to God
[36:26] but these stars have to sell himself to
[36:29] a dark realm and the higher they raise
[36:33] the darker it becomes and he begun to
[36:37] make these statements he said that's the
[36:39] reason Michael Jackson couldn't sleep he
[36:44] said that's the reason he couldn't sleep
[36:46] he was living in such a dark realm he
[36:52] was living in such a dark realm to where
[36:56] that he he couldn't get rest or come
[36:59] back down you tell me he was happy I
[37:06] don't care how much room walking he was
[37:08] doing and think about the blindness of
[37:15] their Jehovah Witness they thought he
[37:18] was the Messiah that's a very little
[37:24] unknown fact but they promoted him as a
[37:27] messiah
[37:27] I'll tell you what he was a pervert out
[37:30] of Hill
[37:38] they're only now discovering in his
[37:41] trash and his nonsense it's kind of like
[37:44] the day that just hung himself in prison
[37:47] the other day he hurt a lot of people
[37:50] and he thought because of his power and
[37:53] his money that he could abuse young
[37:56] girls and get by with it forever let me
[37:58] to say shanon's will find you out and
[38:01] one day you'll come back to meet those
[38:04] sins and it was six a coward he couldn't
[38:09] face a judge what made him hanged
[38:13] himself oh no it wasn't he didn't want
[38:16] to tell him nobody else he couldn't live
[38:18] with himself sins cruel let me just tell
[38:28] you sins cruel
[38:40] brother branham tell us about a doctor
[38:43] that was one of the women doctors and
[38:49] I'm gonna say this very delicately that
[38:52] was one of the first abortionist doctors
[38:58] and he said when she came to die she
[39:05] kept screaming put me out put me out put
[39:08] me out all I can see is those babies at
[39:11] the window
[39:33] one day I was called as a pastor here I
[39:36] was called to a home I was working for
[39:41] you brother Thomas a nice called to a
[39:44] home where a lady that had set here
[39:51] and she wanted me to stop her and I
[39:55] don't know if it was her husband I don't
[39:56] know I don't know what the deal was
[39:58] it's not part of the issue now and she
[40:01] was standing there with a vast of booze
[40:06] in her hand and she was standing at the
[40:12] door and she was standing with that
[40:14] booze and it was shaking like that and
[40:17] she said I need help I need help
[40:26] I was the one to help her but she
[40:32] couldn't let this go she couldn't let
[40:42] this go
[40:47] let me just go on in my preach to get
[40:49] now you got it warm enough now I can
[40:52] preach I'll save that
[41:00] but the homer felt led for me to go it
[41:02] and pray for a family they hadn't come
[41:05] for a while and he said I want you to go
[41:07] visit him one more time and it was a
[41:10] Sunday afternoon and I climbed up on
[41:13] their steps and you was with me and I
[41:15] climbed up on their steps and I knocked
[41:17] on the door and they were having a party
[41:18] right through the door and the knocked
[41:22] on the door and I knocked on their door
[41:23] and they stood there with their booze in
[41:25] their hand and they made fun of me
[41:29] standing on the door what'd you do
[41:39] brother on oh man and I'm an honest man
[41:45] I'm real it hurt my feelings
[41:51] hurt my feelings but I've got
[41:55] instructions
[42:06] brother Nathaniel you would have never
[42:09] known these people but every one of
[42:13] those people are dead today they're all
[42:18] dead
[42:21] at Party Time it won't last forever
[42:28] the Rompin and the playing and being the
[42:31] girl that everybody's fantasy dream I
[42:34] don't last forever I don't last forever
[42:39] because even when Satan gets done with
[42:42] you he don't want you but they're
[42:52] helpless on the outside of the door
[42:55] today if you could have an interview
[42:57] with them a they want to be right here
[42:59] they'd trade seats with anybody here
[43:02] Elvis Presley Marilyn Monroe you can
[43:07] name all of them Patsy Cline all of them
[43:09] would like to trade seats I find it
[43:16] interesting I was sitting in the back
[43:18] room and Bethenny singing here and while
[43:22] I'm studying Matheny as he's singing it
[43:26] dropped in my heart that's a gift that
[43:28] Patsy Cline had why here why in this
[43:35] place God brought her on incredible
[43:37] deliverance and she's listening brought
[43:44] her an incredible deliverance and I
[43:49] helped and they made an album and when
[43:56] they made that album when they went and
[44:00] made the album with the la Fontaine's
[44:03] helped make the album put it together
[44:06] there was an old man that played music
[44:08] on that album and when he got done he
[44:11] said you might be interested to know
[44:14] that I once played for a girl named
[44:16] Patsy Cline I'd say it's a quite a conch
[44:24] quite an incredible leap between Patsy
[44:28] Cline and Bethany Lawson now what you
[44:36] don't know is I just set before her just
[44:40] a couple days before with her daddy and
[44:43] I told her something that she hadn't
[44:45] told nobody that there was two people
[44:48] that was trying to get her to sell her
[44:49] gift to the world and that was the
[44:54] spirit that was trying to destroy her
[44:56] life so what if the world can make you a
[45:00] star so much
[45:12] so light you'll have your ten minutes of
[45:16] fame and then it's over with and you're
[45:19] going to face eternity with this
[45:24] somebody told me their excuse for not
[45:27] coming to church it's quite an
[45:28] investment to sit in church two hours
[45:35] quite an investment I'll tell you how
[45:38] it's going to be longer than two hours
[45:42] there's nothing in this world that I
[45:45] would trade for I've seen some good
[45:50] places I met good people but being a
[45:55] good person don't give you eternal life
[45:58] having degrees all over your walls and
[46:01] having phenomenal money I don't mean
[46:03] anything they don't mean anything some
[46:08] of you know this i go to i go to auction
[46:10] estates and and I go to estate auctions
[46:14] let me say it like that and I tried to
[46:17] go to ones that are very wealthy people
[46:19] because wealthy people have a lot of
[46:21] toys because money don't satisfy so they
[46:28] had the best furniture they have the
[46:30] best of everything and in an auction in
[46:32] the back for nothing you can buy for
[46:33] pennies on a dollar you kids starting
[46:43] out that's a good place for you to buy
[46:44] your furniture you can go buy you can go
[46:51] buy some of the best couches for pennies
[46:54] on a dollar and buy a $5,000 couch for
[46:59] $300 or you can go to Shoals and buy a
[47:03] piece of junk
[47:09] [Applause]
[47:24] Jim you work in my home a lot brother
[47:26] Terry you work in my home a lot people
[47:28] say oh you got good stuff yeah I do I do
[47:30] I got good stuff but I pay pennies on
[47:32] the dollar for it I equip my entire
[47:37] office for less than less than a
[47:39] thousand dollars and the table alone is
[47:43] a seven thousand dollar table
[47:50] now there have no doubt said a lawyer
[47:55] they use the table that I used in his
[47:58] office and I can tell you the lifestyle
[48:02] that he lived he wasn't a Christian so
[48:06] he left it all
[48:08] he left it off he left it all don't
[48:15] admire that I'm saying all that to say
[48:18] this go admire that don't admire those
[48:23] things that will deteriorate and go away
[48:27] got it Myers act hope I didn't hurt your
[48:33] feelings there some of you want to know
[48:41] my business how how I got successful
[48:44] well that's what I did
[48:48] you buy things for pennies on a dollar
[48:50] and you sell it for the real dollar
[48:53] I don't don't try to be my competition
[48:59] ambitious and here's a woman it's
[49:11] offered you know it hurt to hear people
[49:18] laugh at her and make fun of her it hurt
[49:24] one day she's walking up into her house
[49:26] and then she's walking
[49:27] they said burn Fannie when you get to
[49:32] heaven how will you ever know that it's
[49:38] Jesus she turned around under
[49:40] inspiration and wrote a song I shall
[49:43] know him I shall know him I shall know
[49:46] him by the nail prints in his hands many
[49:54] of you walk to the altar to one of her
[49:56] songs pass me not o gentle Savior hear

[50:17] of salvation purchase of God or the
[50:26] brand of mentions another woman and her
[50:29] name was Susanna Wesley brother Owen

[50:34] day in prayer before her day even

[50:52] a fire two homes burned down she gave
[50:57] birth to 19 children none of them died
[51:01] at birth no this is one of the most
[51:06] difficult things
[51:07] is one of her children died by an
[51:11] accidental smothering of the nurse hurt
[51:20] her husband was worthless her husband
[51:27] was worthless he never paid their bills
[51:31] he never he never was applied himself at

[51:40] to weaknesses of his life here she was
[51:44] with a man that was worthless nine
[51:48] children dies three more of her children
[51:55] would bow as babies but two of her kids
[52:01] one of them to be John Wesley would be
[52:05] the messenger of the day and the other
[52:08] would be Charles Wesley who would be one
[52:11] of the greatest songwriters of all town
[52:14] it was birthed out of tremendous hurt
[52:19] I'd like to just just wave a banner
[52:22] tonight shaken you're not a winner
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:44] brother banner mentions this man he's
[52:48] not the messenger of the age but he was
[52:50] a powerful man he was a disciple of John
[52:54] being a disciple of John he was very
[53:00] well-known you would know him when I
[53:02] tell you his name Polycarp everybody
[53:08] else is getting put to death and he's 86
[53:12] years old he knew his time was coming
[53:20] because they arrested one of the men
[53:22] that was carrying these letters carinii
[53:26] sermons they arrested that man that man
[53:29] told that he was working for Polycarp
[53:34] so he knew that they were coming he knew
[53:44] when they opened the door what they were
[53:46] there for gotta give him a vision only
[53:51] the week before that he was going to die
[53:53] by fire in quit
[54:27] showed up to rested he said if you could
[54:32] just give me one thing
[54:33] let me pray he said I'm gonna be a while
[54:38] but let me pray he got off his knees he
[54:42] started prayer and he prayed for two
[54:44] hours and in his prayer he prayed that
[54:49] God would forgive every man forgive the
[54:54] Pope forgive the men that were against
[54:57] him are we back and ready today he asked
[55:01] God to forgive every one of those first
[55:03] few ters and he asked God that he could
[55:09] be such a sacrifice that he could be a
[55:13] testimony even as he died
[55:20] the men that came to arrest him
[55:28] and a hard time some matter of fact they
[55:33] stopped on the way to where they were
[55:35] going to burning and they tried to push
[55:40] him off finally they stopped him that
[55:46] did push him off said no way can we let
[55:52] you go be burned at the stake he got up
[55:55] and dusted himself off and said I've
[55:57] seen in a vision that I'm gonna die by
[55:59] fire he's gonna be with me he climbed
[56:05] back up and when he got better I asked
[56:13] him do you have any last requests he
[56:17] said would you let me preach a little
[56:18] while and so he preached two hours while
[56:25] he was standing on top of the wood and
[56:28] men were given their hearts to God all
[56:31] over the place
[56:37] and then he quoted our Lord Jesus into
[56:42] the hands I commit my spirit
[56:45] they lift the fire and the fire begins
[56:47] to come up around him begins to
[56:49] consuming and it wouldn't touch him the
[56:55] fire refused to touch him
[57:04] so man took a sword and started in
[57:07] inspiriting and out of his body came a
[57:12] dove their hurt didn't destroy the music
[57:28] brother Jordan you'll be interested to
[57:30] know brother Jacob and sister Mary came
[57:36] from the Hutterite community it's okay
[57:46] to leave that community had to leave
[57:49] with the clothes on his back and escape
[57:54] when they escaped they don't have a
[57:57] opportunity to work at same job do the
[58:02] same things and he escaped at great cost
[58:05] but brother Jake did just didn't escape
[58:08] himself but brother jake has spent much
[58:12] of his life going back and getting more
[58:15] and there's people sitting in Edmonton
[58:19] and all over Canada because that man
[58:23] that stood up a little while ago and
[58:26] waved at you
[58:26] that man was willing to receive a lot of
[58:31] hurt for the cause of the gospel of
[58:35] Jesus Christ
[58:51] rather Jake I just tell you now well
[58:54] done
[58:56] I'm no voice at all to stream it to you
[58:59] but one day God will scream it to the
[59:01] echoes of the heavens well done I want
[59:16] to tell you this God pays all his debts

[59:30] grandchildren he'll not forget home Jake

[59:40] the name of the Lord he'll not forget
