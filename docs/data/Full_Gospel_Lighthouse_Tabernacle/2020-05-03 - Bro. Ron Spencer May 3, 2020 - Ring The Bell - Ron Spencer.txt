amen blessed be the name of the Lord I love it when God shows up and snatches us right out of the hand of the enemy a man I pray that you feel what we feel in your homes what we feel here this morning felt like ten thousands of angels have gathered to watch his children worship and that's not just here but that's there in your homes where you're standing at where you're where you're on your feet sitting down where you are there's a Living God that is there that has showed up to watch you and take care of you and minister to you we know that it's here this morning for he told us where two or three are gathered in my name there I will be in the midst of them so we know that he's here and we know that he's working and we're excited to be in the house of the Lord this morning and man we bring you greetings once again trust you all had a wonderful week and and just praying that we're closer to the end of this mess and soon we can reconvene as we want to and it looks like there the government is trying to push and reopen things so we just ask that the Lord would minister to them and help them in their guidance and we want to be back here as soon as possible but we also want to be very aware of the city we're facing so we just pray God's God and so on on every decision that we make also as brother Donny was singing this morning it made me remember so that I can send out a little heads-up remember next weekend is his Mother's Day and so if you if you have your mother and reach out and and send her a happy Mother's Day everyday the Prophet told us every day should be Mother's Day and Father's Day and and not just a certain day of the year or a commercialization of the day but just to remember your mother and I know that there are Saints that are with us that do not have their mother and their mothers done went on went on before them and so we appreciate our mothers and so we just want to make that reminder to you and she don't miss you don't necessarily need flowers but flowers never hurt but you always tell her you love her and just how much she means to you just remember she brought you into this world she could take you away from it if he won't watch yourself so so we want to be remembering these things also want to be remembering brother on this week is a very big week for him this is a week that we've been looking forward to this week he will go go to the doctor to the labs and also on Tuesday they will be doing scan scans on brother Ron's brain and to see if they can if everything is kosher and we believe it is because we found a word that says that by His stripes we are healed and so if the scans are clear they can take them off the steroids which should help with the sugar and so we're very very much praying about that and believing also on May the 11th they will be doing scans of brother Ron's torso which is a very big scan and so just will be remembering these things I'm placing these things before you just so just so you know to be praying about them we've been praying this whole time that they'll be clear and we are expecting that this day on Tuesday and on may 11th that we will see miracles that has been our theme this year that God is with us and we will see miracles and we are believing that that God has showed up and will show out hey man so we're praying that they're all clear and we're just looking forward to the things that God is going to do and God is doing now a man before we go to the word this morning maybe we could sing that song the the power of your love Lord I come to you amen Lord Lord I come to you let my heart be changed renewed flowing from the grace that of [Music] Lord I've come to know the weaknesses I see [Music] we'll be stripped away [Applause] by the power of your love [Music] Hey

here today in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your Bibles will turn over to two portions of scriptures over to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 32 in verse 17 then also to Luke chapter one and verse 37 Jeremiah chapter 32 and verse 17 I'm sorry we do not have these scriptures and the songs on the screen for you today we're having a little bit of technical difficulties but but the Lord gives us grace amen Jeremiah chapter 32 and verse 17 o Lord God behold thou has made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee Luke chapter 1 and verse 37 as you're turning there you're you'll remember that this is when the the angel Gabriel is speaking with with Mary about the things that are happening and I love I love what the angel said for with God nothing shall be impossible a man may God bless his word he may be seated where you are this morning I'd like to just share a few things with you this morning I've been dreaming the last few nights that I have been introducing a heavyweight champion and so that is what I'd like to do just for a few moments has introduced a heavyweight champion he was a man when he came down off of the mountain hungry looked around on a fig tree for something to eat he was a man while he was hungry but when he taken five little biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000 that was more than a man that was God speaking through human lips it's true he was a man that night laying in the back of that little boat out on that stormy sea the little boat was tossed about like a little bottle stopper and ten thousand Devils of the sea had swore they drowned him that night he was tired he was a man tire he was laying in the back of that boat but when once aroused walked forward put his foot on the braille of the boat looked and looked up towards heaven and said peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him that was more than a man speaking there that was the great and mighty Conqueror he spoke to the wind and it went through the cave like a puppy dog and the sight of a lion he spoke to the waves and they folded their hands and perfect rest upon the sea bosom he was more than a man he was the mighty Conqueror he could conquer nature he conquered death he conquered the waves he conquered the air there he is there's never been one like him oh I know you think I'm excited maybe I am but let me alone you may think I'm crazy but I'm more happier this way then I was the other way so I'd rather be this way oh my when I think of who he is sure he cried for mercy at the cross like a man but on Easter morning the Romans sealed the stone could not hold him he broke the seal and rolled away the stone and come out the mighty Conqueror a man he's thrilled the heart of every poet every prophet every man that's ever amounted to a hill of beans in this world has believed him that way Eddie Eddie Eddie prayer he if we could call call him to the scene we what do you think about him said living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away rising he justified freely forever someday he's coming oh glorious day now many men has set out to conquer did you know that Napoleon set out to conquer the world and he did at the age of 33 he conquered France and he conquered many nations but he could not conquer himself he died an alcoholic and he met his end at Waterloo he started out at a conquer but he died in disgrace but there was another young man who came into the world one time and he died at 33 and he conquered everything there could be conquered when he was on earth he conquered passions he conquered pride he conquered sickness he conquered devils when he died he conquered death when he arose Kurt Hale he went up in and conquered everything that was against mankind that is my champion that's the one I'm introducing this morning he is not he my champion is not as some mythical God as Hercules or Zeus he's not some fairy tale he's not some fictional character but my champion is a living God he is the reality of realities he is the Lord of lords and King of Kings my champion has never his power never diminishes my champion is always on time he never gets tired my champion razors are dead my champion saves and lost my champion delivers the bound and my champion heals the sick my champion forms worlds by his words my champion shows up and the enemy is defeated my enemy the enemy is destroyed and the enemy is defeated when my champion shows up the world right now is looking for a Superman to stop a virus but I have already found my Superman and that is none other than Jesus Christ and if you want to see my champion you can look over into Revelation chapter 1 and you can see my champion standing there with the keys of death and hell in his hand standing in the midst of the church and that champion is standing in the midst of the Church of Laodicea today and he says that I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore he cannot die he cannot die again and he said amen to it and I have the keys of hell and of death we started this year off with a theme that God is with us and we will see miracles and I don't know about you but I have seen just that that God has been with us and we have seen miracles God has been with us and every day and every day has been a miracle to be with him we have seen him do mighty acts during this season but no miracle is made without a mess and no miracle is possible without a crisis we look out and look out and we see the preserving of brother our sailors life and all of that and every little detail is a complete miracle that brother Roger is still with us to look out upon our congregation of the guidance of the Holy Ghost in all of their lives and keeping them during this process we look and we think about our pastor brother on his whole process that he's been through of just just giving the things that are laid out in front of him the things that were that were told to us by doctors and we see this process and we see that God has been with us we look back to the dream that brother Tim bruit had and that morning he heard a voice and my mom heard a voice also woke up singing that we will see miracles we will see Giants fall we'll walk on waters brother Tim in another part of the house heard that same hurting him same angels as it were singing we will see miracles and I'm having a dream of buzzards being fed to pigs and and immunotherapy being administered to brother on and it's in it and it did its work and then we look at the weekend that brother Wayne Lawson came and spoke to us on the things that that that were pertaining to us for us to rejoice for joy is coming in the morning and that weekend that weekend when brother Wayne was here our pastor brother on his vision had started to leave and what was happening was Satan was stiffening and tipping his hand that he was coming in for the death blow but what Satan didn't know is that he allowed he allowed and he tipped his hand there was something more than just cancer in the lungs but there was a brain tumor and once again we watched God's show up and we watched doctors as they were able to perform surgeries and remove lemon sized tumors and I say to Satan and all of his hips today that brother on Spencer is still alive so boo devil so take that devil the many might say that we ain't seen God in this but I have seen our champion show up many might say that they haven't seen God in this but I have seen God in this we know that I saw is worth 10 thousand worlds and we have seen soul save during this we have seen many encourage during this whole battle and many encouraged by the strength of brother on of him facing this giant as he went through it we watched as testimonies came forth we have seen God and we have seen miracles and we have watched as this battle has brought forth and brought strength to many and I have seen a mighty conquer stand up and I have said that he is with us and we have seen his miracles who is a church we have seen God so up and we have seen him become the champion of our life we look back at all of it you can look back at your life history and think about the things that God has brought you through and the things that God is from but look behind this pulpit this morning and look to the pastor brother on it look at the things that God has brought him through just his whole life the testimony that we have seen a champion show up in his life when he fell from a 40-foot ladder and he broke every vertebrae down on his back and the doctors told him to prepare that he would never walk again and that night he walked out of the hospital and he's still walking hit by lightning twice bit by a copperhead two strokes a heart attack I'd say that God has been with Brotherhood through a flower that looked like death had worn and he was still preaching on the other side the enemy has tried to kill brother on and we could say that God has been with us that God has been with brother on through a fire and it looked like he would never preach again but he would still come out preaching diagnosed with cancer and he still preached two brain surgeries and he still preached chemo treatments and he's still preached I'd say we have a champion we have a champion as a savior as a deliverer and I'd say we have a champion as a pastor for gospel lighthouse and today is nineteen weeks today is nineteen weeks since the angel of the Lord visited our pastor and spoke to him and said that if you'll trust me I'll use you like never before we have watched a champion show up today I'd like to introduce you to you more more than just a dream of of a heavyweight boxer but I'd like to introduce a devil destroyer a serpent bruisin champion preacher and my dad Reverend Ronald Dean Spencer [Applause] I think we're on now there we go god bless you I don't think I've ever been introduced anywhere no we're all quite like that I'd like to just take a little bit I I won't speak long to you I I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I first of all want to thank you for every prayer every interceding for us as as not just myself but also for this church and the family I'd like to thank you for everything that you've done for me we are we are in a battle and it's a been a very difficult battle and we knew it would be we know it is and we know it's going to be but God's greater than cancer he's greater than cancer no matter where it's at in the body he's greater than all of that and I'd like to thank all of you that has been coming to take care of every service and Wow I have been so blessed by it I've been blessed as a bride around the world has been blessed and I'd like to thank God to have great generals around the world that is standing with us with their congregations that have been praying for us and in this battle and I I'm honored to be here I I just I just something is something over the last week just put a drive inside of me to to stand here this morning the first of the week this week we've we were at the doctor's office and and by the way I'd like to just preface this might be in here yes we're breaking a few rules but I wanted to be here my doctor I hope she doesn't find out that I'm here but I I'm practicing safe safe distances so so so and I'll go back home and behave myself as a good boy but I'd like to thank my family for taking care of me sister Connie for being such a wonderful nurse there's been a lot of good days and there's been a lot of difficult days and I like to thank them for that I kind of feel like this morning now I just put some notes down with some very personal feelings I don't know what Daniel felt like but if he would have been given an opportunity to speak from the lines then I'd like to give him a voice I don't know what Joe would have felt like from an ash heap but if he had real believers around him and I'm talking about real believers that didn't give up and didn't think that he had sinned or that was with him and that was standing with him how he'd like to like to say that God's with me David after testify enough of holding a bear and a lion by its mane and now he's walking off of the hill without a rock in his pocket but he knew if I can get to the brook if I can get down to the brook God's load some rocks down there that killed a lot of soldiers and Goliath mistake was as he didn't kill David before he got to the brook and when David picked up one he picked up five together one fer the Goliath and four for his brothers David can't come and speak to us today but I can I have been given months to live by dr. standards a precious doctor came in one night while we were in the hospital she sat down on my bed and and she began to talk to me begin to weep with me she said you're between the devil and the deep blue sea and I reminded her that Jesus was standing in that sea she told me that all the doctors had convened in a meeting and they had come to a consensus and I have the most phenomenal doctors I'm just so I'm so pleased with them they said they are going to do their best for me and one particular doctor spoke up and said we're going to do our best and we're going to give it all we've got and his God will take care of him he has brother Wayne Lawson was here and Satan tipped his hand and for those that are looking for the end miracle don't miss the miracles that are happening in between because there's got to be a phenomenal amount of miracles to happen the in miracle for me to ring the bell God's got to keep me he's got to be with me and I want to stand and report he has where the Wayne law suit would come and preach and I would go blind on my left side which continues to remain and I feel kind of like Jacob with a thigh that that the angel had touched I believe that Satan touched his hand he tipped his hand and came in for the killing blow and we knew something was wrong something was going very bad wrong in the next 24 hours we would find out that we had three brain tumors and one was the size of a lemon and was bursting and at the end of that week they would take that out then the next couple weekends we would would go back to the hospital again and our lungs would be filled with with with blood clots in her legs and they would do a surgery and then at the end of that week we would have gamma ray gamma knife ray surgery again all of that weakened our body it seemed like every week we'd get up we'd get bad news but God's been with us through every every phase of it last night my my sugar went to an unregistered amount but I'd like to report to you as I stand here in the heat of this journey with kind of limited strength something's driving me this morning to walk with Jesus like never before I got up as I do every morning and open my devotional book and my devotional book said it's another day to walk with Jesus and I thought how fitting that it is fitting that it is that in my first couple of quotes walking with Jesus I believe God will give me strength for it for about 30 minutes if you could just help me just for a moment a couple scriptures that I want to read with you and I will just skip some scriptures if if you will just bear with me in Isaiah 53 who hath believed our report and and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground and he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief he's acquainted with where I'm standing just now brother Donnie as if we hid it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not and surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows and we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted that's the scripture that the doctor quoted to me that night but he that he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes and not only remind us as believers but I want to remind the devil with his stripes we are healed Jesus would pray these prayer this prayer our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name that kingdom come Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread as we forgive our debts and we forgive our debtors lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen Romans chapter 4 in verse 17 and this is after the blood of Jesus Christ is applied I have made thee a father of many nations before him him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father many nations according to that which was spoken so shall I see be and being not weak in faith but consider not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving glory to God I'm reading about more than a man four thousand years ago I'm reading about you that are struggling with cancer that has been given up you that have all kind of diseases today across the world that the devil says you don't have long to live I'm reading about Jude it's not about having faith in doctors though we're thankful for them and we're thankful for what they're doing for us we're thankful for the medicine God heals through all of those things but when they've done all that they can do when they come to the end of their rope God is not weak he's got us by the hand he'll take us through when there's nowhere else to look not even cancer will stand before you and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform we're reminded that God is not a God that lasts man gets in crisis I have been in a crisis I have come to this spot to where that then I can't lean on man I've got great friends if phenomenal friends that are praying for me and they can pray for me and they can say I'm standing with you and I'm phenomenally thrilled that great men great audiences are standing with me in prayer but there is a king of kings there is a Lord above lords that has taken my case he has taken my case standing in another round people are watching strengthening there's a great cloud of witnesses but sometimes we're reminded that we're standing along with Jesus it's not that Jesus is with me it's um with him I was being taken to an operating from one operating room to another with a with an apparatus on my head with a pain level of ten and they had already given me three shots and I knew that I was going to be enough chamber for three hours and it's me and Jesus or I'm with him the transport man was transporting me down the hall and I begin to pray and as I prayed I said Lord we have been reminded by your prophet that we can be cycle breakers and then the cycle of melanoma which is known to be the fastest developing cancer once it develops and gets inside and becomes stage four it just begin to stack attack organs and just attach that it loves the brain it just goes to the brain it just loves the cells of the brain and there's actually a communication between the brain the lungs I thought about my children my grandchildren the church here the bright around the world and I began to pray the Lord let me be the the cycle breaker that my children walk did it my grandchildren won't get it my church the bright around the world if I have to suffer through this let me be a cycle break up and I prayed that in the name of Jesus Christ and the transport men said and he just in a very quiet tone he said that's a prettiest prayer I've ever heard I'll tell you you know when to pray when you get in the spot sometimes it's just it's just comforting it's comforting for someone to say a kind word it to you and a very at a very crisis moment a doctor to take you by the hand nurse to take you by the hand and say I'm with you a preacher to take you by the hand but I'm reminded that if we can touch Jesus we're touching more than a man we're touching Almighty God forgive me for sharing some of those very private moments brother Branham reminded us over and over again I'm not your healer I'm no more than a man no more than I'm a divine Savior in my limited lifetime the limited gifts that I have been given in my life I've always always had a thing that I look at that jesus said I can do nothing except my father shows me first I've always been reminded of those quotes that brother Branham said I'm not the healer I was only there when those things happened standing in prayer lines all across the world I've saw phenomenal miracles happen take place I myself of that phenomenal miracles take place but once again even with difficult tests laying right in front of us I felt inspired to come this morning to remind us that I want to smack the devil in the mouth before he gets the chance to smack me over the next couple of weeks so I want to remind him that God still the healer no matter what test results print if the cancer is worse God still my healer if it has spread through my body God still my healer it wasn't the angel that brought up cancer it was brother Branham that brought up tents even cancer jesus said I am the way I am the door I am the love I am reminded that Abraham was told by God himself I have made thee a father of many nations and Abraham took him at his word the scripture says that now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen hopeful even take us will not even take us but so far their spots to where that hope can't take you it takes a personal revelation of the word of God to hold us brother man says you're here to fulfill it to walking conscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious of the world walk us wise you walk in Christ walk with him not paying any attention to the right hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God walk with God hope at nineteen is knows nothing to turn around for this is candy compared to what's coming in a Tribulation Period something comes into the church walk with God if sickness strikes you walk with God it's a beautiful quote as long as sickness hasn't struck you but when you are in the heat of the battle walk with God I spoke with brother Danny Stephen this morning he was one of the guys that found out it was a secret that I would speak today he didn't know it until they actually called me and I shared it with him because I figured he couldn't tell nobody else this morning right quickly but I just asked him a question I said I'm going to the pulpit this morning I said wonder how many wonder how many preachers had stood in a pulpit with stage-four brain and lung cancer with the difficulty sitting right in front of them I want to I wonder what the conversation is in hell I wonder what the conversation is in hell we're still a witness that God's a miracle working God if sickness strikes you walk with God if your neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God but the random must have had one of those neighbors like that Enoch one day walk like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God he got so far up the road till he didn't walk back home he didn't want to go come back anymore with you with walk with God the doctor says that you're going to die walk with God the doctor says you can't get well walk with God just walk with God that's all for God has promised I'll I'll never leave you I'll never forsake him I'll be with you to the end of the world he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he he'd confirm it just walk with God then you're going to have your ups and downs I've been reading these quotes for 30 years although that was training for this morning you'll have your ups and downs don't worry census of a sermon last Thanksgiving don't worry you got to go through your briar patches and over some sharp drops and over Bluffs down the hillsides up through mountains over waters but walk with God yes sir there's so many hills to climb fall upward you've heard that old song but but now little it'll seem when you get there get to the end of the way just look at it all that's been look back at your footprints they won't seem to be very much it won't be very much Abraham considered he's not his own body now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he didn't think about that he didn't consider it it wasn't even brought into the understanding he didn't even consider it at all these are big statements he didn't even consider it at all he just considered what God said and he went on is it a little bit of a theme ring the bell it is told to me at the end of the journey if I can make the end of the journey in the natural realm there's a bell that rings it says you don't have chance ourselves no more I want to ring it today I'd like to ring it today there's a bell that's ring before every champion Andrew didn't know what I was going to say I didn't know what he was going to say there's a bell that's run before every heavyweight champions battle now he can be the champion for years hold that title for years but there is there's always somebody that's a challenger and that challenger wants to meet now if he's qualified to meet and they begin to set the ground rules out and they'll a such a time and a place and and such a reward then training begins to happen whether it's months or weeks or a year but there comes a time that that that champion is sitting there as a champion to remain champion he's got to answer the bell sometimes we can come to thee to the to the journey of the word and feel like we're rapture ready but between here and the rapture they're still going to be battles they're still going to be confrontations but you've got to be ready and prepared to answer the bell lack of preparation will get you it but God says I'll never put more on you than you can breath we're reminded that a faith that cannot be trusted cannot be tested cannot be trusted we're not holding on to some emotional story some emotional feeling some emotional event some relic kissing of a statue we're not we're not even trusting our five senses because their five senses will take us in many directions it'll take us spots that will only cause us to get disappointed there will be days to where we feel like that everything is going to be alright there are days that we feel like that we're in the bottom of the Great Gulf and we can't live through the day but we're not trusting that the scripture says that every Sun that cometh to God must be tested some say oh oh if I could only have brother Branham here of my favorite preacher here maybe if I lived way back there similar another I can only go back you see we've got a word that lays in front of us and goddess gave us the greatest weapon that he could give us is his work and it must become personal revelation and inspired to come off of the pages of the word and not just go through your lips as empty words that we pour out against the devil but there must be an emphasis of inspiration an emphasis above the lift like an eagle that will go into the air and be reminded that I'm a champion overtop of a storm and make the challenge of the hour we must keep herself in a certain atmosphere and stay prepared stay focused and there's only one that can make the way I'm not looking to brother branham and I'm not saying that with no disrespect at all I thank God for this message I preached it for all of these years now but I'm looking to Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith I'm not looking to great friends I'm looking to Jesus I'm looking to be an overcomer of this trial realize that I'm a final runner in the race like you are we're final runners toward the rapture I'm reminded that God is God and Satan is Satan if you don't believe in a devil brother Brendan said when I first got started I run headlong into him every day don't tell me there's no devil because I know better I have to fight with him every day I know there's a devil but you must be trained when you meet him not trained in philosophy not trained in education but trained by the Holy Spirit God's power in his word to make it manifest it know your enemy I think it's one of the greatest absences sometimes as we underestimate our enemy know your enemy oh what a cruel thing that he is there's no man on earth that is God certainly not we're all human beings and never everyone born in sin shapen iniquity come to the world speaking lies but as we've been through it's so plainly to show that God once lived above this creature because of sin then he lived with his creature in the form of a body Jesus Christ put his tent with us dwell with us made flesh with us to suffer sin and pain and agony and things to do then he sanctioned a church that he might dwell in so it was God above God with and God in us and Jesus says and at that day that you'll know that I'm in the father and the father in me and I in you and you and me see there if God's working through and when a person is so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit in speaking it is not the person speaking and he said I know this by experience he said the contest our contest is a test of strength and he said we have we have we have the test of strength the indian used to put a fire and they would put a so many man on the end of a rope and so many men on the end of this rope and Uggla of war and the contest of strength would pull and loose the enemy losing party across the fire and we know there's so many things we know we know there's many things and we could base this upon a few minutes of the contest but I want to speak for a few minutes quickly on the greatest contest that's between the church and Satan the great strength of Satan and we want to speak of this great strength of God in his church and the great contest that's going on for many years it started in heaven and Satan was kicked in the earth and then became became the enemy to God's people and he's used all of his strength and strategy to pull God's people across the fires and into the fires we know who has the most power God does and when God gave his people the best thing that he can combat Satan with is his word is because God's Word and and who's stronger and who's stronger than God the Word of God and the word becomes our strength and God in His Church becomes the strength of God to pull Satan to his own fires that he has made he's made him against you he's made them against me and God in you will pull cancer right into the fire in my name you'll cast out Devils people who do not believe in demons in this day till my opinion is no your enemy know your enemy trained the contest you're going to have to meet him trained trained just gonna skip a few thoughts if I can brother Branham says I've I've watched as he fights Luke 8:45 says this and Jesus turned and said who touched me it won't be but a couple more moments now I've got a lot to say but I'm feeling a little weary who touched me when all denied Peter and they'd that with the master master the multitude throng the impress thee saying who touched me and Jesus said somebody touched me and I perceived that virture has gone out of me and the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling falling down before him and declared unto Him and before all the people for what caused that she touched him a lot of people touched him I touched him I would have rubbed wanted to rub shoulders with him I'm honest I'm being very honest with you I wouldn't have been ashamed I wouldn't have been ashamed a lot of people do it in private believe but but they but they're different people in public a lot of people are one way in church or one way in a home or maybe one way to watch a service like this but they they want to be or they really want to be a Christian and they want to be identified with Jesus but they're in a different way other way cancers are bad is a bad thing to fight but sins much worse we have a nation that don't have answers and we have a nation that's everybody's proclaiming we want the Cure we want to get a get a cure I'll tell you Jesus is secure I'll tell you I'll tell you the cure for sin I'll tell you that the cure for Kogan 19 I'll tell you the cure because we're headed to a to a place where he's pink and he'll bring perfect peace and there'll be no sickness there we'll live in perfect harmony and I'm not looking to a president or to a king or to a lab I'm looking to Jesus and when this woman left her home the doctors couldn't do no more for her and it'd been that way a long time she'd decided if I can touch the hem of His garment I know I be made well how many thousands touched him I didn't get that touch just to touch and her body was clean I'm thinking even now and if you would just give me a couple more moments this church has made this message the church has made this message a place toward Jesus can feel comfortable that all of his work can be preached and we don't have to pick through his word this is a church that believes in the the full open word were people of the open book where Jesus came down in this generation with this nail-scarred hands and and it was revealed 2000 years ago as Jesus would be after the resurrection and he would tell his disciples touch me handle me handle me I'm proof a mother I'm alive and I'm not dead no more handle me listen through the Dark Ages the Catholic Church held the precious Word of God away from the people and maybe priests would stand there and give them a scripture and interpret it for them and they tried to believe it and overcome it with the best of their hearts but in this day this message was revealed not a partial word but it was totally restored by the mainly angel himself and a prophet would say you're not feeding on the mind of a man but you're feeding on the body word of the son of man take the book and eat the book handle me handle me many touch the Bible and don't get it many read the book and don't get it but may the word so become alive in your heart may it become so alive in your heart until the life of Christ that is in that word live on the inside of you may it so live on the inside of you there was one tree in the garden that they were forbidden to eat but the other one they were they were told it eat of that Jesus what's the tree of life he's still the Tree of Life if this be my last sermon don't you never lose your focus and get your eyes on man or get your eyes on this world there's nothing to turn back to you keep your eyes on Jesus Christ he's the author he's the finisher of our faith there's man like him it's beyond our senses it's beyond what we can see tastes Mellor he'll you say I went through some things I'm sure you have each of us have a story it will not be by our strength brother Donnie you have fought the fight that I'm fighting many the sets in this church had fought the fight every thought is different every battle is different whether it's depression whether it's whatever it is but it's not greater than God 12 years ago I was released from the hospital and it was said that I was saying when I came out of a coma Blue Devil but I'd like to continue to say that today I went back and I went back and did a little research and there was another fighter he wasn't in our in our realms but they called him the greatest fighter that fought in our generations his name was Muhammad Ali and it was known for his talking in the ring and George Foreman said that they got up real close one time and and he said he was right in Muhammad Ali's ear and he said I had give him everything that I had and he was still standing and he said Olli whispered in my ear is that the best you got I'd like to whisper in the devil's ear and you that's in a great trial even this morning I want to help you to whisper in the devil's ear is that the best you got brother onder's had not put fear in your heart do you know what you have been through yeah but you see it ate me because there's a lot of days I couldn't have lived through already but the God inside of me said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end of the world yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on I have about 20 more pages but I'm not gonna get there [Music] [Music] regal old hallelu is true [Music] [Applause] [Music] marching I have been watch butters of all punctured circling camps they have builded him an altar I can't be his righteous sentence [Music] March [Music] [Applause] [Music] Laurie hi Mistral is marching on and it has been his truth that has marched us this far and it'll take us all the way through it has been none other than the Spirit of the Lord has brought us safely thus far has brought brother on this far and I believe that he's a God that isn't just backing off of his promises but he's a God that finishes the work and I'm believing with everything that's within me that the same champion that our pastor preached about today is answering the call to the Challenger he's not just whispering in our ears but we're whispering back to him from a living God it's saying is that all you got if Satan throws all that he's got if he throws all that he's got that God and God's children he still don't have enough because you got to remember at the end of the day that Satan is nothing but a tool in God's hands I was sent this quote this morning said prophet speaking about Legion he said that I thought with a complete surrender to the devil can give man maybe five times the strength what would a complete center surrender to God do to a man what would it do to a that's weakened body and can't walk or something if we could just completely yield to the Holy Ghost and give us super strength to rise in the name cause greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world the strength in God that's in you is greater than any affliction can come upon you there is nothing that can overtake you that can supersede you because you are full of a superpower and that superpower is the Holy Spirit that dominates your life if you're a Christian and that power of the Holy Spirit is that that is dominating the life the body of Jesus Christ we give God glory so we say take that devil you thought you had him you thought you had him with cancer you thought you had him my brain surgeries you thought you had him with tumors but God still God bhudev Oh Full Gospel lighthouse I'd say you're shouting on that end to the end of the the hook-up this morning you have heard from a man that Satan swore that he would kill Boudewijn a sing a song let the glory of the Lord rise amongst us let the glory of the Lord arise among us let the glory of the Lord who rise among us let the praises of us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll give the Lord a hand clapping freeze let the glory of our Lord rise above us he's higher than the highest he's greater than the grace no one could ever take his ground away that's my king greater than any cats greater than any sickness greater than any problem greater than encoded 19 greater than a doctor's report I believe his report I'll take his word I'll take his word because when cancer is defeated God's Word will still remain yes highest ground [Music] [Music] [Music] you left this home
