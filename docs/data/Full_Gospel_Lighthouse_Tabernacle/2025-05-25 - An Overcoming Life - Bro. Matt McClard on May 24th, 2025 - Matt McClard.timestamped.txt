[9:42] Oh, shiny like
[9:44] sun at the trumpet call. Lift, oh Lord,
[9:50] the year of
[9:52] Jubilee. And out
[9:54] of all, behold, he
[9:57] comes. Behold, he comes riding on a
[10:02] flower or shining like

[11:28] Oh, once my heart was full of sin. Once
[11:32] I had no peace within, till I heard how
[11:37] Jesus died upon the
[11:41] tree. Oh, then I fell down at his feet

[14:59] God's power is alive.
[15:05] People say that our God's
[15:10] dear has no power
[15:16] might not that he's
[15:21] living. Think this faith is alive.
[15:28] We can help that they say
[15:33] this for they do not
[15:39] understand. Many wonder and
[15:45] reason. Say he was just a man.
[15:53] What about the
[15:58] truth? What about the
[16:03] light? What about the
[16:09] messy? Is it still
[16:14] life? Oh, just think upon his

[17:19] Jesus and he'll keep you on
[17:25] track. Oh, what about the
[17:32] truth? What about the
[17:38] lie? What about the mystery?

[21:31] gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[21:32] grateful and thankful we are to you,
[21:34] Lord, that you've once again brought us
[21:36] into your presence. And Lord, when we
[21:39] come into your presence, Lord, all
[21:41] things are possible, Father. Lord, the
[21:44] world just seems to fade away, Lord. We
[21:46] begin to think on you and lift up your
[21:48] name and praise and worship. And we
[21:50] recognize, oh God, and we begin, as it
[21:52] were, to feel the brush of angel wings
[21:54] all about us, Lord, as they've come to
[21:57] watch the elect worship you, Lord, what
[22:00] an honor and a privilege, oh God, it is
[22:01] to worship you and to sing you praises
[22:04] and to just to express our love to you,
[22:06] Lord. As we've come gathered together,
[22:08] Lord, this evening and under the
[22:10] authority of this word and under the
[22:12] blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, we ask
[22:15] that you forgive us of our sins. Every
[22:17] negative word that we've spoken, Lord,
[22:19] or every negative thought or anything,
[22:21] Lord, that displeas you in the slightest
[22:24] way. We humble ourselves before you,
[22:26] Lord, and ask that you forgive us. Help
[22:28] us, Lord, to get up one more time, Lord,
[22:30] as a true soldier of the cross. take the
[22:33] sword of the Lord and the shield of
[22:35] faith and to march on. We love you,
[22:38] Lord, and we just ask your blessings
[22:39] over this service. We, Lord, lift up
[22:41] every request, Lord, that was read
[22:43] tonight over this pullpit, Lord. We're
[22:45] such a needy people, but Father, life
[22:48] makes us needy, Lord, and we're just
[22:50] always in need of you, Lord. But that's
[22:52] kind of what that's what you want
[22:53] because you're a father and we your and
[22:55] we're your children. And we just bring
[22:57] our requests, Lord, to you. And many
[22:59] times their doctors do what they can do,
[23:01] Lord. and man trying do does what they
[23:04] can. But Lord, even in every situation,
[23:07] Lord, that we face, we just lay it at
[23:08] your feet. Lord, your prophet would come
[23:11] around and say, "There's nothing as
[23:12] powerful as a committ." And we take all
[23:15] of these requests and we just commit
[23:18] them to you. Many things we don't
[23:20] understand, many disappointments of
[23:22] life, but Lord, regardless of our
[23:24] disappointments, regardless of our
[23:26] misunderstandings or not understanding,
[23:29] we're just going to lay them at your
[23:30] feet. We're going to commit them to you
[23:33] and we're going to trust you, Father.
[23:35] Lord, and we know that it'll all work
[23:37] out. We thank you, Father, for your
[23:39] blessings, Lord. Now, we ask that you

[23:56] the preaching of the word. Open up our

[24:00] gift and the word that you've given our
[24:02] brother. Lord, may we just take it. May

[30:20] freedom wasn't based on what I've done.
[30:26] his goodness and
[30:30] mercy in the power of the
[30:39] blood. I thought
[30:42] I
[30:47] deserve to be six feet
[30:51] beneath the earth.
[30:58] For all the things I've done, the things
[31:02] I've

[32:21] carried. Now I've been made free by the
[32:28] mercy of
[32:30] God. Was the grave meant for

[34:15] blood. Blood is goodness and
[34:20] mercy and the power of the blood.

[35:47] Jesus, you don't hold me
[35:55] any more than
[35:58] anything that you can do.
[36:03] I just want
[36:12] you. I'm
[36:16] sorry when I've just gone through the
[36:20] motions. I'm
[36:24] sorry when I just sing another song.
[36:30] Take me back to where we
[36:33] started. I open up my
[36:37] heart to
[36:45] you. I'm
[36:49] sorry when I've come with my agenda.
[36:55] I'm
[36:57] sorry when I forgot that you're
[37:02] enough. Take me back to where we
[37:07] started. I open up my
[37:11] heart to
[37:17] you. I'm caught up in your presence.
[37:24] [Music]
[37:27] I just want to sit here at your
[37:34] feet. I'm caught up in this
[37:39] holy
[37:43] moment. I never want to leave.
[37:52] Oh, I'm not here for
[37:56] [Music]
[38:00] blessings. Jesus, you don't owe me
[38:06] anything.
[38:10] And more than
[38:12] anything that
[38:15] you can
[38:17] do, I just want
[38:25] you. I just want
[38:30] you. Nothing
[38:34] else. Oh, nothing else.
[38:39] Nothing else will
[38:43] do. I just want
[38:47] you. Oh, nothing
[38:50] [Music]
[38:52] else. Oh, nothing
[38:56] else. Nothing else will
[39:07] do. I'm coming back to where we
[39:16] started when I first
[39:20] felt
[39:22] your
[39:26] love. I'm caught up in your presence.
[39:36] I just want to sit here at your
[39:43] feet. I'm caught up in this
[39:47] holy
[39:51] moment. I never want to leave.
[40:00] Oh, I'm not here for
[40:08] blessings. Jesus, you don't owe me
[40:16] anything more than
[40:19] anything that you can do.
[40:25] I just want
[40:28] [Music]

[45:29] [Music]
[45:32] Let's sing. He's in the house. I believe
[45:34] he's here tonight.
[45:36] I believe all things are possible.
[45:39] He's in the house. Little
[45:42] girl, little girl was lying there. Help
[45:46] me where you want me. One of those
[45:50] keys was lying
[45:53] there. People
[45:55] [Music]
[45:58] always they just laughed at
[46:02] Jesus. He said she's only
[46:08] sleeping. As he took her by the
[46:13] hand, she began to live again.
[46:19] Some began to praise the
[46:22] Lord. Some began to
[46:26] [Music]
[46:27] [Applause]
[46:28] say, "He's in the
[46:33] house." The death has to think about it
[46:36] now.
[46:39] Now there is
[46:42] light where darkness used to
[46:47] be. And now there is
[46:53] hope. There's no more
[46:57] doubt. Oh, praise his
[47:03] name. He's in the house. He's in the
[47:08] house.
[47:09] or he's in the
[47:13] house where death has to
[47:18] flee. Now there is
[47:23] light where darkness
[47:29] you now there is hope.
[47:35] There's no more
[47:38] doubt. Oh, praise his
[47:43] [Music]
[47:44] name. Praise his
[47:49] name. Oh, praise his
[47:54] name. For he's in the house.
[48:01] How many believes that tonight? How many
[48:03] believe he's here?
[48:05] How many has a
[48:07] need? I believe he can meet your need.
[48:10] It's not just a hope as you're lifted
[48:12] up. Why don't you believe all things are
[48:15] possible tonight? I don't care if you've
[48:17] dealt with that thing for 25 years.
[48:20] Why don't you believe over top of 25
[48:23] years? That's what Abraham did.
[48:26] What do you walk around with? His
[48:28] promise. You can walk out of here with
[48:30] your promise tonight. Amen. Amen. Let's
[48:33] bow our hearts to him. Father, we love
[48:35] you. Thank you for the atmosphere that's
[48:37] here in the building, Lord. God, I just
[48:39] ask you to just take this service, God.
[48:42] Lord, this gift you placed in my life,
[48:44] Lord, I just commit it to you right now
[48:45] once again, Father. God, may you come,
[48:48] Lord. I've studied, Lord. I've labored.
[48:50] I've looked, Father. And God, I just
[48:52] know you're going to put it together,
[48:53] Lord. And that's what I'm depending upon
[48:54] tonight, God. God, I pray, Lord, that
[48:56] you just move in a mighty way tonight,
[48:59] Father. God, may you meet the needs of
[49:01] the people, Lord. You saw their hand
[49:02] raised, Father. God, you don't know. I
[49:04] don't know what it is, but you know,
[49:06] Father. And God, I ask that you go to
[49:08] each need, Lord. And may you speak faith
[49:10] to them, Lord. That they would believe
[49:12] tonight, Lord. There's a revelation
[49:14] that's happening upon their midst,
[49:15] Father. That they'll leave different
[49:17] than what they came, God, that all
[49:19] things are possible tonight, Father.
[49:21] God, we just ask you to move in a mighty
[49:23] way. Take these lips of clay, Lord God,
[49:26] and may you minister your word. Speak
[49:28] direct, Lord God, that they may know
[49:30] it's you, Lord, in this dark hour. We
[49:32] love you, Lord. We pray for Brother
[49:33] Andrew, Father. God, that you bless him
[49:35] in the morning. Pour out your spirit.
[49:37] May it be a mighty outpouring of the
[49:39] Holy Ghost, God. Bless our friends down
[49:41] there in Louisiana, God. Part of the
[49:43] body, Lord, part of the family, Lord.
[49:45] And may you just be with us tonight,
[49:46] God. And we'll be careful to give you
[49:48] all praise and all glory. In the name of
[49:51] the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[49:53] And amen. And if you have your Bibles,
[49:55] I've got to extend a a special birthday.
[49:58] My uh my little Ella is 8 years old
[50:01] today.
[50:03] So, she met me laying in bed. I was in
[50:07] bed and she's right here. Dad, today's
[50:09] my birthday. Yes, honey. It is. Amen. So
[50:12] thankful for our little ones and we
[50:14] certainly love them. And you know, uh
[50:16] last time I was here,
[50:18] I my son wasn't married, but now he is.
[50:22] It goes fast. My goodness, I've heard
[50:24] that my whole life, but my goodness, it
[50:25] goes fast. Hold them tight. Amen. Amen.
[50:29] If you have your Bibles, it's good with
[50:30] you tonight. You just you just pull and
[50:33] you know, we've uh we've studied and
[50:35] there's times you come up here and
[50:36] you're like, "Lord, I know where we're
[50:37] going." And there's times you come up
[50:39] there and say, "Lord, I'm trusting you."
[50:40] Amen. Every time you're trusting, but
[50:42] man, when you're really trusting, but
[50:44] that's the good times because then you
[50:46] know it ain't you one bit. It's him.
[50:50] It's him. If you turn your Bibles,
[50:52] Revelation chapter 3, verse
[50:55] 21, 3 and verse 21. To him that
[50:59] overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me
[51:01] in my throne. Even as I also overcame,
[51:07] and have sat down with my father in his
[51:09] throne. He that had an ear, let him hear
[51:13] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[51:15] You have your seats tonight. I get rid
[51:18] of this thing.
[51:25] I want to take a thought if I might by
[51:27] the help of the Lord of an overcoming
[51:29] life.
[51:31] Self tricks and mind
[51:34] battles. Self tricks and mind battles.
[51:38] The word overcomer here just to kind of
[51:40] set a little foundation. Overcomer means
[51:42] to subdue, conquer, overcome, prevail to
[51:46] get the victory. I don't know about you,
[51:48] but I'm all about getting victories.
[51:50] Amen. When I come to church, I want to
[51:52] see victories. I don't want to come to
[51:54] church and just have Come on, somebody.
[51:56] We should live in revival. Brother
[51:57] Brandon would preach this and how can I
[51:59] overcome? He would set the set the pre
[52:01] the the reason he preached this message.
[52:03] Let me let me tell you this. He says he
[52:04] says and I want to take my subject this
[52:07] morning of how can I overcome? Now, I
[52:09] chose this because I think it's time
[52:11] that we should never let the spirit of
[52:14] revival die. I don't know about you,
[52:17] he's coming for a bride that's on fire.
[52:18] Amen. That means every time we come to
[52:21] church on Monday, you should get up and
[52:23] be on fire for God. Amen. On Tuesday,
[52:25] you should get up and be on fire for
[52:27] God. We should live in the presence of
[52:30] God Almighty. Say, "Brother Matt, that's
[52:32] unreasonable." No, it's not
[52:33] unreasonable.
[52:35] That is a thought straight from the pits
[52:37] of hell that yes, you go through down
[52:39] times and up times, but let me tell you,
[52:42] are you weak sometimes?
[52:45] But let the weak say, I am strong. So
[52:47] even in your weakest hour, the word
[52:50] tells you, you're still strong. You're
[52:53] still an overcomer. You're still got the
[52:55] victory. Saints of God, I don't care
[52:57] where you at. You are going in a
[52:59] rapture. Why would we not be victorious
[53:02] every day? You say, "Brother Matt, I go
[53:05] through battles and I lose battles."
[53:06] Yeah, that's right. But do you get up?
[53:09] Do you get up? Do you get up? I say,
[53:11] "Get up tonight. It's time for us to win
[53:14] every battle."
[53:18] Matt, that's unreasonable. No, he called
[53:20] you to win. He won. He showed us the
[53:24] way. And that same spirit lives inside
[53:26] of you. And that same spirit overcome
[53:29] when he walked the face of the earth.
[53:31] What spirit do you have inside of you?
[53:33] It's the Holy Ghost. And the Holy Ghost
[53:36] is an overcomer. The Holy Ghost is a
[53:38] winner. The Holy Ghost wins the battle.
[53:48] Listen, brother tell us in the church a
[53:50] book, the bride when she
[53:53] recognizes, let me read it to you. Just
[53:55] setting a little foundation to you. Come
[53:56] on. I'm looking for an invincible army.
[53:58] I don't know about you. I'm not looking
[54:00] for an army this week.
[54:04] Come on, saints of God. We've gone too
[54:05] far down the road.
[54:10] It exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[54:13] attempting destruction of God's people,
[54:15] and discrediting of God's word. He hates
[54:17] the book of Revelation, but we love the
[54:20] book of Revelation. Why? Because it
[54:21] tells us where we came from, and it
[54:23] tells us where we're going.
[54:26] Right down to the time is cast down to
[54:28] the lake fire. He fights that. He cannot
[54:30] stand it. He knows that the people get
[54:32] the true revelation of the true church
[54:34] and what she is and what she stands for.
[54:36] She can do the greater work. She will be
[54:39] an invincible army. Let me read you the
[54:42] definition of
[54:45] invincible. Incapable of being defeated.
[54:54] But the man I don't feel like that
[54:56] person. Well, I'm glad it's not based on
[54:58] your feelings.
[55:01] What was it brother Matt Walkin says?
[55:02] Feelings are overrated. But the word of
[55:05] God is true every day, every hour, every
[55:08] minute, every second. And if the word of
[55:10] God, the prophet of this hour said we'd
[55:12] be an invincible army, then I believe he
[55:14] saw off in a distance a bride in step
[55:17] saying onward Christian soldiers, saints
[55:21] of God. This is that time. This is that
[55:24] time for the bride to rise up and show
[55:27] who she is. Not that she's anything, but
[55:31] he is
[55:33] everything.
[55:35] Incapable of being
[55:37] defeated. Overcome or
[55:42] subdued. One more quote and then we'll
[55:44] start
[55:45] preaching. Yeah. You know you pull, we
[55:48] preach. Let's have church.
[55:52] I'm glad that a man can live so close to
[55:55] God till the devil don't know what to do
[55:59] with him. How many's testimonies right
[56:02] there? Go ahead, raise your hand. Raise
[56:05] your hand in faith. You may not feel
[56:07] like it. That's all right. You raise
[56:09] your hand in faith and say, "You know
[56:10] what? I got a place in that invincible
[56:12] army. I may just be a private, but I
[56:15] tell you what, a private in the army of
[56:17] God can do all kinds of things. A
[56:19] private in the army of God has the same
[56:21] sword. A private in the army of God can
[56:24] pray and move mountains.
[56:27] Go ahead, raise your hand. That's who I
[56:30] am. Let the devil know whose side you're
[56:33] on. I'm on the winning side. By the way,
[56:36] you lost at Calvary and you're still
[56:38] losing today. I'm just here to prove to
[56:40] you you're going to lose again.
[56:48] Brother man says this is we find here
[56:50] that God always has overcomers. Aren't
[56:54] you glad he didn't say overcomer? He
[56:56] said
[57:00] overcomers. How many overcomers got in
[57:02] the building? That's right. And they
[57:04] overcame him by the word of their
[57:07] testimony and the blood of the lamb. And
[57:10] by the raising of your hands, you defy
[57:12] gravity and say, "Lord, I'm one of
[57:14] them." him. Hey, may maybe this week you
[57:16] didn't feel like it. Maybe this week you
[57:18] didn't feel like you were winning
[57:19] battles. But I'm here to tell you, let
[57:21] me speak to your faith. God sees more in
[57:24] you than you see in you. He knows who
[57:26] you are. He saw you before the
[57:28] foundation of the world. He saw that
[57:30] predestinated seed come to life and he
[57:32] saw it come to full maturity. That he
[57:35] would say, "Here's my invincible army.
[57:38] They may not look like much to you, but
[57:41] let me tell you, when you push at them,
[57:43] they're coming back at you.
[57:48] You know, this is where you push back at
[57:50] the devil. Let your amen go. He's trying
[57:53] to keep your amen. He's trying to keep
[57:55] you from entering in
[57:56] service. He's trying to keep you back
[57:59] from having a good time in the house of
[58:00] God. He's trying to keep you back. He's
[58:02] scared that you'll realize who you
[58:05] are.
[58:07] Cuz once you
[58:09] recognize, then let me tell you, there's
[58:12] nothing he can do to you.
[58:21] Could you imagine the devil's coming
[58:23] back, man? I've been at brother Doug on
[58:26] Monday. He had a headache. But you know
[58:29] what? He was singing grace, grace by
[58:32] noon.
[58:34] And on Tuesday, I caused all kinds of
[58:37] problems at work. I'm telling you what,
[58:39] I thought I had him so frustrated. But
[58:42] you know what? He bowed his head and
[58:44] prayed over his
[58:46] food. I tried to get him to lose his
[58:49] faith. I tried to tell him his kids
[58:51] weren't going to make it. I'm going to
[58:52] use you, Brother Doug. You're my buddy.
[58:54] I've tried to tell him all week long.
[58:58] How many's ever felt the effects of
[59:00] that?
[59:02] It's not fun, is it?
[59:04] It seems so real, but if you were
[59:07] recognized, it's nothing but a lying
[59:09] devil behind it.
[59:11] Then why don't you look him square in
[59:12] the face on this service and say,
[59:14] "Hallelujah. I love the Lord anyway. It
[59:16] doesn't matter what you do to me. You're
[59:18] not going to stop me. I'm going forward
[59:20] in Jesus Christ. And tonight, I claim
[59:22] victory."
[59:27] I'm getting ahead of myself, but it's
[59:28] good anyway.
[59:32] He says he's always had overcomers. He
[59:34] had overcomers in every wage. There's
[59:37] always every time in every age there's
[59:40] been on earth, God has always had
[59:42] somebody he can put his hands on. Oh,
[59:46] hallelujah. How many like have's already
[59:49] got the hands of God already been all
[59:51] over your life? Hallelujah. How many
[59:54] seen demons cast out of their life? Come
[59:56] on, somebody.
[59:59] How many How many seen walls come down?
[1:00:01] Well, you never thought walls would ever
[1:00:02] come down.
[1:00:04] Listen, he didn't start that work, not
[1:00:06] to finish it. But he's looking for an
[1:00:08] invincible army. He's looking for a
[1:00:10] bride of Jesus Christ to come in step
[1:00:12] with the message of the hour. I'm not
[1:00:14] saying know the message of our you can
[1:00:17] know all about it. You can quote it from
[1:00:19] tip to stern. Amen. You can quote it
[1:00:21] from front to back. But can you walk in
[1:00:23] it?
[1:00:25] That's the overcoming. Because the
[1:00:27] overcoming goes right against self-will.
[1:00:35] Overcome, brother Ram. These are quotes
[1:00:37] right here. Overcome me. You want the
[1:00:39] definition of things? I believe the
[1:00:41] prophet gives a good definition because
[1:00:42] he's seeing into another realm to let
[1:00:44] you know where he's coming from.
[1:00:46] Overcome means to stand the
[1:00:52] test. How many likes test? Rebecca, you
[1:00:55] like test?
[1:00:58] No. This is finals time,
[1:01:01] right? How many like their finals? Man,
[1:01:04] I'm glad I didn't have to do any of
[1:01:05] those, brother. I hated those
[1:01:08] things. I forgot more than I
[1:01:11] learned or never learn what I forgot. I
[1:01:13] don't know. One of the
[1:01:16] two. Brother Brandon would say, he says,
[1:01:18] "That's the greatest thing that God
[1:01:22] could put on you.
[1:01:25] It's the greatest thing
[1:01:28] because God knows you can pass that
[1:01:31] test.
[1:01:34] God knows before you know a lot of times
[1:01:37] all the time. God knows you can pass
[1:01:40] that test. I'm speaking to your faith
[1:01:42] tonight. I'm really getting down. Come
[1:01:43] on now. I'm speaking to your faith. I
[1:01:45] know some of you are going through tests
[1:01:46] and trials right now and it feels like
[1:01:48] your face is low as as low as this that
[1:01:51] and the other. But listen, talk to your
[1:01:53] faith and say, "Faith, God said I was an
[1:01:55] overcomer. God said he wouldn't put more
[1:01:57] on me than I can handle. God said I God
[1:02:01] said God said God said you take your
[1:02:04] faith and begin to speak words of life
[1:02:06] to it."
[1:02:14] Give me a minute. That's good.
[1:02:19] Pick me up, too. Speak to your
[1:02:24] faith. Sometimes you don't feel like it.
[1:02:29] Sometimes you don't feel like walking
[1:02:30] out that door and coming right
[1:02:34] here. Sometimes you don't feel like
[1:02:36] walking through there. But let me ask
[1:02:37] you, are you here?
[1:02:41] So, somebody did some overcoming
[1:02:43] tonight. They didn't feel like it, but
[1:02:45] they're here anyway. and why they're
[1:02:47] here. They don't realize it, but God is
[1:02:50] moving in a supernatural way by the word
[1:02:52] of God. And their faces begin to change.
[1:02:55] And demons begin to get exposed for who
[1:02:57] they are. And they recognize that's a
[1:02:59] demon. Been telling me that all week and
[1:03:02] I've listened to him.
[1:03:06] All right, I'll give you an example from
[1:03:08] my life. I'm on my way home from
[1:03:10] Kentucky and I'm crying thinking, "Oh
[1:03:13] Lord, I'm an open book. Sorry. It's who
[1:03:16] I am. You don't like it. Preachers have
[1:03:18] faults. Preachers got
[1:03:20] faults. I'm just dumb enough to say
[1:03:22] them, I guess. I don't know. I think it
[1:03:23] helps somebody. I think it really helps
[1:03:26] somebody to know the people you look to,
[1:03:28] they have faults and they have trials
[1:03:29] and they have hardships, but they go
[1:03:31] through anyway.
[1:03:36] I'm on my way home and I'm just like,
[1:03:37] Lord, am I missing something? What's
[1:03:39] wrong, Lord? Lord, something's wrong.
[1:03:42] What did I do?
[1:03:44] this I went through I cried the whole
[1:03:46] way home just thinking I just been in
[1:03:47] some awesome meetings and what's my
[1:03:49] problem what's my problem Lord Monday
[1:03:53] got up same
[1:03:55] thing right there in my
[1:03:58] face Lord if
[1:04:00] I if I don't have it Lord I sure want
[1:04:04] it brother Matt you shouldn't ever think
[1:04:06] that come on these thoughts are real
[1:04:09] these mind battles are
[1:04:12] And finally I said, you know what? This
[1:04:14] these thoughts are doing nothing but
[1:04:15] driving me down. Oh,
[1:04:19] then these thoughts can't be the mind of
[1:04:22] God. And as soon as I thought that
[1:04:25] thought and said, "Devil, it was gone."
[1:04:28] Just like that. And I did struggle all
[1:04:32] week with it. Why? Because if you resist
[1:04:35] the devil, he will flee. Will he test
[1:04:39] you whether you got the Holy Ghost? Will
[1:04:41] he say you don't have the the devil will
[1:04:43] say
[1:04:44] anything? And he can bring you down. But
[1:04:47] once you recognize it's the
[1:04:50] [Music]
[1:04:51] devil. Yeah, he messed with the wrong
[1:04:55] ombre. Those thoughts for real. My tears
[1:04:59] running down my face for real.
[1:05:02] How many wants more of God? You know the
[1:05:05] devil plays on that.
[1:05:08] Yeah, you've always wanted more of God.
[1:05:10] You're never going to get it. Well, you
[1:05:12] don't realize today's your service.
[1:05:16] Come on, let's speak in faith tonight.
[1:05:18] Today's your service to get more than
[1:05:20] you've ever had.
[1:05:24] David had so much it was overflowing. I
[1:05:27] don't know about you, that's where I
[1:05:29] want to live.
[1:05:33] Brother Matt, you saying we could do
[1:05:35] that? That's what I'm striving for.
[1:05:40] Yay. Though I walk through the valley of
[1:05:41] shadow death, I will not fear. What was
[1:05:44] David showing you? Even though you're
[1:05:46] going through the valley, you still got
[1:05:48] your faith. You still got it. Amen. Even
[1:05:51] though the battle is rough on you. Come
[1:05:53] on, somebody. I know I'm down right down
[1:05:55] where you're preaching, where you're at,
[1:05:56] where you're living. You know what that
[1:05:58] is? That's nothing but a devil trying to
[1:06:01] convince you that you can't live that
[1:06:04] kind of life.
[1:06:07] call his bluff. Listen, the devil
[1:06:10] doesn't like these kind of meetings. He
[1:06:12] don't like when God goes into your
[1:06:13] thought life and makes you recognize
[1:06:16] that is a lie. How many's ever seen a
[1:06:18] snake before? You know, I saw a snake in
[1:06:22] Virginia. I didn't see many snakes in
[1:06:24] Indiana. It's too
[1:06:26] cold. I walked out to my barn the other
[1:06:29] day, opened the door, and dropped one
[1:06:31] right here in front of me.
[1:06:38] I don't know about you, I don't like
[1:06:39] snakes.
[1:06:42] I was searching for a
[1:06:45] stick. Dude's only that
[1:06:52] long. But when you recognize there's a
[1:06:54] devil been playing in your mind all
[1:06:56] week, why don't you go after him with
[1:06:58] the word of God? Why don't you go after
[1:07:00] him? Don't let the preacher go after
[1:07:02] him. Why don't you go after him? He
[1:07:04] said, "Devil, I'm sick of you. I come to
[1:07:06] break your back." I didn't get him in
[1:07:08] the head, but I got him in the back and
[1:07:09] he looked sideways going down the
[1:07:14] hole. I don't like any snake devils. You
[1:07:17] know, snake devils. We're just going to
[1:07:19] preach it. I'm wide open. And there's
[1:07:20] notes there, but they're there. You
[1:07:22] know, snake devil, you know, a snake
[1:07:23] will hide right there in the open.
[1:07:27] How many's ever walked by one and be
[1:07:28] like,
[1:07:31] "Whoa, I think there was one in Davey's
[1:07:33] boot right one time. Came right into
[1:07:35] your house." Yeah, we had a revival.
[1:07:39] Woo! Glory. Somebody let the snake loose
[1:07:42] in my
[1:07:46] house. But those that devil, I've been
[1:07:49] studying on the devil. Why you been
[1:07:52] studying on the devil? Cuz that's who
[1:07:53] I'm preaching
[1:07:54] against. I'm an evangelist. I'm going to
[1:07:56] go find me some
[1:07:57] devils. Brother Matt, you're crazy. No,
[1:07:59] no. That's what God called me to do. He
[1:08:02] called me to go into churches and find
[1:08:03] where the devil is trying to feed at
[1:08:05] him. He lied. Listen, the devil hates to
[1:08:08] be exposed, so he'll hide. I know. Come
[1:08:10] on, somebody. He'll hide. But that's all
[1:08:12] right. The Holy Ghost will reveal. The
[1:08:14] light of God will bring it to surface.
[1:08:16] The light of God will reveal. That
[1:08:18] devil, and it might change a face. It
[1:08:20] might look funny, but let me tell you,
[1:08:21] there's a soul on the inside of us
[1:08:23] that's crying, "Help!" And that's what I
[1:08:26] want to do. I want to help somebody.
[1:08:32] But those devils will hide right there
[1:08:34] in your living room.
[1:08:38] Lord, those devils will hide right there
[1:08:41] in your pocket.
[1:08:44] You know what I'm talking about.
[1:08:48] I'm talking about overcoming life, young
[1:08:50] man.
[1:08:53] I'm talking about overcoming life. Oh
[1:08:55] man.
[1:08:57] Brothers and sisters, it's time we
[1:09:01] surrender everything we
[1:09:13] are
[1:09:16] self. Brother said the biggest enemy he
[1:09:19] had
[1:09:20] was William
[1:09:22] Brandon. Well, let me tell you,
[1:09:25] Adam, your wife is not your biggest
[1:09:28] enemy. It might be your dad, but well,
[1:09:31] no, your wife is not your
[1:09:34] enemy. Brother Alen is not your enemy.
[1:09:38] Everybody turn to your neighbor and say,
[1:09:39] "You're not my
[1:09:41] enemy." Yeah, I just broke some
[1:09:43] arguments between husband and wives.
[1:09:46] Well, preach, brother Matt. Go
[1:09:50] ahead. The person sitting next to you is
[1:09:52] not your enemy. That guy at work is not
[1:09:54] your enemy.
[1:09:57] Come on,
[1:09:58] somebody. But the one that you look at
[1:10:00] in the mirror, that's your enemy.
[1:10:05] Why don't you look into the word of God
[1:10:07] and say, "Lord, I'm not trying to point
[1:10:09] it over here and see somebody else's
[1:10:11] reflection, but Lord, what do I look
[1:10:13] like?
[1:10:15] Why don't you be honest with the message
[1:10:17] of the hour? Why don't you be honest
[1:10:18] with the Bible? That's what God wants.
[1:10:21] He wants an honest heart that will look
[1:10:23] into the word of God and when they're
[1:10:25] wrong, they'll simply say, "Father,
[1:10:27] forgive me. I have need of you." But
[1:10:31] that's overcoming some pride. That's
[1:10:34] overcoming some self. I know this isn't
[1:10:37] fun preaching, but we're here anyway.
[1:10:45] How many likes it when you get down to
[1:10:46] the end of it and you're like, "It's my
[1:10:50] fault. I didn't think I'd get an
[1:10:54] amen." What do you do with that, though?
[1:10:57] Do you hide it?
[1:11:00] Do you make excuses for
[1:11:02] it? Sticky.
[1:11:06] Do you
[1:11:08] complain? Or do you say, "That's just
[1:11:10] how I'm always going to be?"
[1:11:13] No, the
[1:11:16] answer is right here.
[1:11:22] Father, forgive
[1:11:25] me. Repentance never stops.
[1:11:29] How do you know that? Paul would
[1:11:30] overcome. And you know how he would
[1:11:32] overcome? I die daily.
[1:11:38] Maybe the reason you aren't overcoming,
[1:11:39] you haven't repented like you truly
[1:11:41] should have.
[1:11:43] Listen, why is God still dealing with
[1:11:46] you? Listen, you can live a form of this
[1:11:49] message all you want to, but you know,
[1:11:52] you know who you are.
[1:11:56] Glory.
[1:11:58] I know rubber meets the road. Maybe
[1:12:00] that's why the Lord didn't show me what
[1:12:01] I was going to preach tonight. I'd been
[1:12:04] scared to preach it.
[1:12:07] Come on
[1:12:08] overcomers. Come on little bride. Let's
[1:12:11] overcome self.
[1:12:14] You know Jesus wouldn't struggle with
[1:12:16] the devil when he met the devil. Even in
[1:12:18] his weakest hour, he didn't struggle
[1:12:21] with the devil. But in
[1:12:24] Gethsemane, he
[1:12:29] struggled. But that's why I struggle so
[1:12:31] much. Uhhuh. Yeah. Because you got your
[1:12:34] old
[1:12:35] will and your old
[1:12:38] will. If we would just learn to
[1:12:42] surrender our will into his
[1:12:46] will.
[1:12:48] Glory. Our will takes us the wrong
[1:12:52] way. But when we say, "Father, I don't
[1:12:54] know what I'm doing. I need your help.
[1:12:58] Lord, I don't know how to handle this
[1:12:59] situation. Listen, I've had situations
[1:13:01] at work. I didn't know what to do with
[1:13:02] it. My flesh wanted to let them
[1:13:08] know. And sometimes I've let them
[1:13:12] know and I've had to go back and say I
[1:13:15] was sorry. But I want to set the right
[1:13:18] example the first time.
[1:13:23] So when you don't know what to listen, I
[1:13:24] don't know where it's coming from. When
[1:13:26] you don't know what to do with that
[1:13:26] situation at work, when that person is
[1:13:29] bothering
[1:13:30] you. Listen, there was a lady at work. I
[1:13:33] knew she This is recently six months
[1:13:35] I've been at this job. I didn't know
[1:13:36] what to do with her. I didn't. She was a
[1:13:42] liberal. I never dealt with liberals
[1:13:44] really. I'm being honest. I haven't. I'm
[1:13:46] in Virginia now and I'm in
[1:13:47] Charlottesville, so I deal with them.
[1:13:54] Not everything's good in Virginia.
[1:13:57] Sorry. Praise the Lord. Beautiful views,
[1:13:59] beautiful people, beautiful church. No,
[1:14:02] stop there. Anyway, I didn't know what
[1:14:04] to do. So, I just said, "Lord, help
[1:14:07] me. I don't know what to do. I I don't
[1:14:09] even know how to speak to her." So, I
[1:14:10] just didn't speak to
[1:14:12] her. I wasn't rude, but I just didn't
[1:14:15] speak to her. I didn't know what to say.
[1:14:16] I didn't know how I was going to come
[1:14:17] across. She knew I was a preacher, and
[1:14:19] she was a liberal. So we never even so a
[1:14:21] word and she didn't like
[1:14:23] me. What' I do? Nothing. So I just begin
[1:14:27] to pray about
[1:14:31] it. She's turned into resation two weeks
[1:14:37] ago. I'm not trying to get somebody to
[1:14:39] lose their job. Don't get me wrong now.
[1:14:41] But when you don't know what to do with
[1:14:42] it, if you just shut your mouth and you
[1:14:45] begin to pray with it, God will take
[1:14:47] care of it.
[1:14:55] Easier said than done.
[1:14:58] Look at this thing.
[1:15:03] Not happy. She She turned her own
[1:15:05] resation. She didn't get fired. She's
[1:15:07] moving on. Going somewhere else. I said,
[1:15:09] "Thank you,
[1:15:11] Lord." When you know you're going to do
[1:15:14] this at some point, it's You know what
[1:15:17] I'm talking about. There's eventually
[1:15:19] something you're going to have to stand
[1:15:20] on. I'm not afraid to. But you know
[1:15:23] what? If we can avoid those things, I'll
[1:15:24] avoid those things.
[1:15:27] I'm not looking for a fight. I don't
[1:15:28] know about you.
[1:15:31] Brother say this. He says, "The thing
[1:15:32] you have to overcome is yourself. Your
[1:15:35] idea, your thing. Surrender yourself to
[1:15:38] him. He overcome for you. He knows the
[1:15:42] way. We don't."
[1:15:45] Man, that is so profound, but yet so
[1:15:47] simple, but yet so powerful. He knows
[1:15:51] the way, but we don't. Why don't you
[1:15:54] give it over to Jesus tonight? The
[1:15:57] places you can't overcome, your way,
[1:16:00] your idea, your thinking about it. Why
[1:16:02] don't you just surrender that tonight
[1:16:04] and say, "Lord, you know the way. You
[1:16:07] know what you're doing. I surrender
[1:16:09] everything I am." You know what you're
[1:16:12] doing? By your surrender, you're
[1:16:14] overcoming.
[1:16:17] That doesn't even make sense, really. By
[1:16:19] your surrender, you're overcoming.
[1:16:26] How many likes a simple gospel?
[1:16:30] Then throw up both
[1:16:32] hands because that's a universal sign of
[1:16:35] surrender. Don't keep one behind your
[1:16:37] back. Don't keep your hand in the sins
[1:16:39] of the world. Don't keep your hand on
[1:16:41] this, that, and the other, but take your
[1:16:43] works and surrender them into the hands
[1:16:46] of the Almighty. And you watch God do
[1:16:48] marvelous things through your
[1:16:54] life. Let me catch another
[1:16:57] one. Who's your worst enemy?
[1:17:01] All right, you didn't get it. Who is
[1:17:05] your worst
[1:17:06] enemy? Say me. Here we go. Ready? Who is
[1:17:10] your worst
[1:17:14] enemy?
[1:17:15] Don't forget
[1:17:21] it. Pause for
[1:17:23] effect. All
[1:17:26] right. You'll remember
[1:17:32] that. Before you get mad, oh Lord, help
[1:17:34] me. Before you get mad and mouth off and
[1:17:37] say things you shouldn't say,
[1:17:45] remember
[1:17:47] tricks. Overcoming tricks. Where you
[1:17:50] coming from, brother Matt? It's a
[1:17:53] quote. Overcome means to recognize the
[1:17:56] devil in every one of his tricks.
[1:18:01] A lot of people say there is no devil.
[1:18:03] It's just a thought. Don't you believe
[1:18:07] that the devil's just as real as God is?
[1:18:11] In fact, the devil's probably sitting on
[1:18:12] this front pew somewhere. Not to scare
[1:18:14] y'all, but he's right here. He's a front
[1:18:16] pew. He comes to the front pew. He not
[1:18:18] sitting on the back. No offense to the
[1:18:19] people in the back. I
[1:18:21] understand. But he comes to church. He
[1:18:24] came to the wrong
[1:18:26] service. He came to the wrong service
[1:18:29] because he don't like to be exposed. And
[1:18:31] a lot of his tricks is what's catching
[1:18:33] you from overcoming. You don't think you
[1:18:34] can live that kind of life. You don't
[1:18:36] think you're a part of the invincible
[1:18:37] army. But let me tell you who that is.
[1:18:39] It's the devil scared to death that
[1:18:40] you'll step into your position of a son
[1:18:43] and daughter of God and you'll claim the
[1:18:45] God-given right that God gave over your
[1:18:47] family, that God gave over your life,
[1:18:49] that God gave you healing, God gave you
[1:18:51] health, God gave you salvation, God gave
[1:18:53] you the Holy Ghost. If he gave it to
[1:18:56] you, don't let any devil take it from
[1:18:58] you.
[1:19:04] Brother man would tell us know your
[1:19:07] enemy. That means you need to study
[1:19:09] yourself,
[1:19:13] too. That's good right there. Know your
[1:19:17] weaknesses and don't let them stay as
[1:19:19] weaknesses.
[1:19:22] Well, I'm always going to be that way.
[1:19:24] No, that's the wrong thought.
[1:19:33] Brother, I've
[1:19:35] always I'm sorry. You're in the presence
[1:19:37] where all things begin to change. You're
[1:19:39] in the presence where they stick a dead
[1:19:41] rod and in the whole 24 hours, the whole
[1:19:43] rod goes through the whole cycle of life
[1:19:45] and brings forth almonds that they can
[1:19:47] go forth there. That's the kind of
[1:19:48] presence you're in right now. It's just
[1:19:50] your kind of glory where you thought it
[1:19:52] was dead and could never live that way,
[1:19:54] but you stepped into an atmosphere this
[1:19:55] evening. You stepped into an atmosphere.
[1:19:57] The Holy Ghost is here. The angel of the
[1:20:00] Lord is in the building. I'm preaching
[1:20:02] the message of the hour. He's in the
[1:20:04] building. And I believe when you get
[1:20:06] under the influence of the presence of
[1:20:07] God, things change.
[1:20:14] How many's ever recognized that? How
[1:20:15] many ever got a spiritual healing in
[1:20:17] service and didn't even realize you did?
[1:20:19] Brother said he said a lot of you are
[1:20:20] already healed and don't even recognize
[1:20:21] it.
[1:20:23] I believe there are spiritual things
[1:20:24] being picked off right now on these
[1:20:26] services. Hallelujah. I believe there's
[1:20:29] supernatural healing going on. There's
[1:20:31] wounds in your spirit that are being
[1:20:33] healed right now in the presence of the
[1:20:35] speaking of the word of God. That's the
[1:20:38] power of the word.
[1:20:41] It doesn't return void. Brother man, I
[1:20:43] didn't feel anything. Quit looking at
[1:20:46] how you feel.
[1:20:50] We're not carnal. We're deeper than
[1:20:52] that.
[1:20:55] I love to feel God. You'll never find a
[1:20:57] a boy that loves the presence of God
[1:20:58] more than I do. I love God. Joshua
[1:21:02] didn't leave. You
[1:21:03] remember? How many believe? You go back
[1:21:06] and look. Moses would leave out of the
[1:21:07] presence of God. Joshua stayed
[1:21:10] there. I believe that's a bride. She
[1:21:13] loves the presence of almighty God. But
[1:21:16] listen, your
[1:21:17] feelings don't dictate what the word is
[1:21:21] doing in your life. If thou can't
[1:21:26] believe, why don't you accept it right
[1:21:28] now for your healing for your past? Come
[1:21:30] on, somebody. Why don't you take that
[1:21:32] complex and say, "You know what? I've
[1:21:33] walked with you too long. I got scarred
[1:21:36] by my parents. I got scarred by an old
[1:21:38] pastor. I got scarred by drugs. I got
[1:21:40] scarred by fear. But you know what?
[1:21:42] There's a presence here that heals all
[1:21:44] things.
[1:21:47] Let him do it. Open your heart. Say,
[1:21:50] "Lord, you've seen my mind battles.
[1:21:53] You've seen my struggles,
[1:21:57] Lord." Now, sometimes God will let you
[1:21:59] go through that to build character in
[1:22:03] you. We get discouraged because God
[1:22:05] doesn't go gone.
[1:22:08] But he left it there so that you have
[1:22:11] something to overcome. Well, why don't
[1:22:14] you look at that problem a little
[1:22:16] differently? You're a
[1:22:18] victory. You're an opportunity for a
[1:22:21] victory. This test, this thing was left
[1:22:24] here to prove I love my Lord. I love my
[1:22:28] Lord over what I feel like. I love my
[1:22:30] Lord over how I'm I'm dealing with this.
[1:22:32] I love the Lord.
[1:22:39] 1 Peter 5:8, be sober, be vigilant, for
[1:22:42] the adversary of the devil is a roaring
[1:22:43] lion walking about seeking whom he may
[1:22:45] devour. Ephesians 6:11, on the put on
[1:22:48] the whole armor of God that you may be
[1:22:49] able to withstand the ws of the devil.
[1:22:52] That word ws means schemes. The devil's
[1:22:55] got all kinds of tricks he likes to
[1:22:56] play.
[1:22:57] oldest trick in the book though, he
[1:22:59] likes to discredit the word of
[1:23:04] God and especially the message of the
[1:23:08] hour. Come on, somebody. He likes, well,
[1:23:11] brother Brandon didn't mean that and
[1:23:12] brother, he didn't really mean that
[1:23:13] there and he these thoughts come into
[1:23:15] you. But let me tell you, the message is
[1:23:17] the message. Leave your hands off of it.
[1:23:19] Leave your thoughts out of it and say,
[1:23:21] "Lord, I want it just the way it is. I'm
[1:23:24] not tinkering with it. I love it just
[1:23:26] the way it is. It was sent to me that
[1:23:29] way. I'm not adding my thoughts to it. I
[1:23:31] don't want a devil's thought to it. I
[1:23:33] don't want a man's idea to it. I want
[1:23:35] what God gave me. Because from that
[1:23:39] message, I am taking a body change.
[1:23:46] Be sober. That means you can't be drunk
[1:23:49] on the things of the
[1:23:52] world. Have mercy a drunk man.
[1:23:58] You ever seen them win a fight? Some of
[1:24:00] them
[1:24:02] maybe, but they get so drunk they're
[1:24:05] disoriented to where the enemy even
[1:24:09] is. I'm coming right down in your
[1:24:11] kitchen. We get so drunk
[1:24:14] on Fox News. Oh, don't say that one,
[1:24:18] brother.
[1:24:19] Man, I'm not CNN.
[1:24:24] ESPN. All right.
[1:24:27] Tik
[1:24:29] Tok.
[1:24:31] FaceTime.
[1:24:34] Facebook. Yeah, that's right. You need
[1:24:36] your FaceTime back. Your face in the
[1:24:40] book. Instagram. Don't let me miss one
[1:24:44] now. We'll be so drunk on what everybody
[1:24:46] else is doing. And God said, "Will you
[1:24:49] drink with me? Will you drink of the
[1:24:52] stimulation of the revelation that I've
[1:24:54] given you in this hour? Because it'll
[1:24:56] make you walk a little bit different.
[1:24:57] Hallelujah. I don't know about you, I
[1:24:59] like getting drunk in the spirit. I like
[1:25:01] getting happy in God.
[1:25:03] Amen. Don't ever take it out of the
[1:25:05] church. That's a trick of the devil. I
[1:25:08] want every tongue talking, prophesying.
[1:25:11] I want every gift in the church of the
[1:25:13] living God. God gave it to us.
[1:25:18] It ain't out of order when it's operated
[1:25:19] by the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:23] Well, preach brother Matt. Well, you're
[1:25:24] so afraid somebody's going to mess up.
[1:25:26] Yes, we're going to mess up.
[1:25:29] But I have an advocate with the father.
[1:25:36] Preach the word, brother.
[1:25:40] Here's another one. He says, "Now, I say
[1:25:43] this with truly love. I wonder if the
[1:25:44] last four or five years have not if we
[1:25:46] haven't got too busy so many things to
[1:25:52] do. Oh, come on. Somebody preach with me
[1:25:54] now. How many's got too many things to
[1:25:58] do? How many's got all kinds of stuff
[1:26:00] that wants to steal your time?
[1:26:03] This is a time to redeem that time,
[1:26:04] saints of God, take it back. Take it
[1:26:07] back. Take it back. Redeem that time.
[1:26:10] This is a time that God needs
[1:26:11] overcomers. And listen, you're not going
[1:26:13] to overcome feeding on a dollar bill.
[1:26:15] Come on, somebody. You're not going to
[1:26:16] overcome getting another job. You're not
[1:26:18] going to overcome getting those things.
[1:26:20] But if you get into the word of God,
[1:26:22] there is a heavenly manner that an
[1:26:25] overcoming power comes upon you and
[1:26:27] you're able to recognize every trick of
[1:26:30] the devil.
[1:26:33] When you recognize a snake, Sister
[1:26:34] Connie, what do you do with
[1:26:40] it, Andrew?
[1:26:42] Andrew is a snake
[1:26:43] killer or
[1:26:47] Cassie. Well, we might not call
[1:26:50] Andrew and we might not call Cassie, but
[1:26:53] I called my heavenly father on the scene
[1:26:55] and my heavenly father said, "Have
[1:26:57] dominion and I can take that devil and
[1:26:59] cast it out." You know, every time Jesus
[1:27:01] met the devil, he met Lucifer in heaven
[1:27:04] and he cast him out. He met him on earth
[1:27:07] and he cast him out. Well, when you meet
[1:27:09] him in your life, cast him out.
[1:27:14] That same spirit's in you.
[1:27:19] Listen, moms, it doesn't take brother
[1:27:21] Ron to come to your house and cast out a
[1:27:22] devil.
[1:27:25] You lay your hand over on that child and
[1:27:27] you begin to pray for them.
[1:27:33] Come on, somebody. I'm not saying
[1:27:35] brother R wouldn't come to your house. I
[1:27:37] know he would.
[1:27:40] But you're doubting the overcoming power
[1:27:42] that's in your
[1:27:46] life. Ah
[1:27:53] man. Hands break. Leave me
[1:27:59] alone. Come on
[1:28:02] overcomers. Come on. I see the look in
[1:28:04] your eyes if there's any devil living in
[1:28:06] my life.
[1:28:08] Any thought that did not come from the
[1:28:10] word of God. Listen, the Bible says to
[1:28:12] renew your mind, I'm renewing your mind,
[1:28:15] I want to renew your mind back to the
[1:28:16] word of God today. The word of God said
[1:28:18] you were an overcomer. The word of God
[1:28:21] called you an overcomer. Amen. The word
[1:28:23] of God said you were more than a
[1:28:24] conqueror. The word of God said you be
[1:28:26] dressed sinless, spotless. The word of
[1:28:28] God gave you health. The word of God
[1:28:30] gave you the Holy Ghost. The word of God
[1:28:33] says you will win.
[1:28:39] The word of God said, "I'd never leave
[1:28:41] you nor forsake you." Maybe you're
[1:28:43] sitting right here in this service
[1:28:44] tonight and you feel
[1:28:47] forsaken. Maybe you feel forsaken.
[1:28:49] That's all right. Why don't you forsake
[1:28:50] that feeling and said, "You know what?
[1:28:52] The word of God says, the word of God
[1:28:54] says, the word of God says you watch the
[1:28:56] presence of God." Listen, he's wanting
[1:28:57] to see will you overcome? Will you take
[1:29:00] that thought and you filter it through
[1:29:01] the word of God? And when the word of
[1:29:04] God said lie, you beat with it.
[1:29:08] Lie. Call that devil's bluff.
[1:29:13] I'm calling for courage
[1:29:15] now. I know what it takes. I was the one
[1:29:17] crying on the way home.
[1:29:22] Everybody else is sleep in the car and
[1:29:27] I'm all I did was say that thought does
[1:29:32] not lift me
[1:29:33] up. That thought does not encourage
[1:29:37] me. It's real simple to filter that
[1:29:41] thought. I pray don't just be a hearer,
[1:29:45] but do that. And you want to watch an
[1:29:48] overcoming life begin to happen. You're
[1:29:50] recognizing that's nothing more than a
[1:29:52] trick of the devil. Listen, sisters, I'm
[1:29:53] going to speak to you right now. Satan
[1:29:55] knows you're weak. He'll catch you in
[1:29:57] your weak hours. He'll begin to say,
[1:29:59] "You're not a good wife.
[1:30:01] [Music]
[1:30:02] You're not a good mama."
[1:30:05] [Music]
[1:30:07] Oh, got thick real quick. Do you
[1:30:10] recognize that is nothing more than a
[1:30:14] lion spirit straight from the pits of
[1:30:18] hell. I know you don't like that devil,
[1:30:19] but I really don't care. You showed
[1:30:24] up. Sisters, you are heaven sentent.
[1:30:29] You are
[1:30:30] God-given. You're an absolute jewel in
[1:30:33] your husband's crown. He loves you with
[1:30:35] all of his heart. He's so happy to stand
[1:30:38] with a wife that'll come by his side and
[1:30:40] lift him up when he is down.
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:30:46] You see what it is? That's a devil,
[1:30:48] brother Matt. But I failed and I made
[1:30:50] all kinds of mistakes. Yes, you're going
[1:30:52] to. I never said you
[1:30:55] weren't. But he said he'd never leave
[1:30:58] me. He said if I fell down, he'd pick me
[1:31:01] up. I'm renewing your mind tonight. I'm
[1:31:03] renewing your mind. Get to thinking on
[1:31:04] God's thoughts. You know, when you begin
[1:31:06] to think about God, he begins to show
[1:31:09] up. Hallelujah. Why don't we begin to
[1:31:11] think about God tonight? Amen. Where has
[1:31:13] he brought you from? And where has he
[1:31:15] taken you from? Has not he been there
[1:31:17] for five years? Has not he been there
[1:31:19] through every valley? Has not he been
[1:31:20] there through every mountain? He's been
[1:31:22] there the whole time. And I'm telling
[1:31:24] you, the same God that's with him is
[1:31:27] with you.
[1:31:34] How do you know that? You're still here,
[1:31:36] aren't you, brother Gabe? How many times
[1:31:37] you thought of quitting, buddy? In
[1:31:39] numerous town, how many times you
[1:31:40] thought, I've messed up. I've failed.
[1:31:42] I'm just going to make a mess of it. I'm
[1:31:43] never going to get there. You're being
[1:31:45] honest with him, buddy. That's my
[1:31:49] friend. But you're still
[1:31:51] here. What is it? Overcoming every one
[1:31:55] of those
[1:31:59] thoughts, man. There's so
[1:32:01] many. All right, 10 minutes. I'm going
[1:32:04] to
[1:32:10] quit. Satan likes to set
[1:32:15] traps. He catches you in a
[1:32:17] trap. How many's ever feel like you
[1:32:19] can't go anywhere? Like you're caught in
[1:32:21] a trap.
[1:32:25] All right, Johnny Crow, let me tell you,
[1:32:27] you're free tonight.
[1:32:30] Johnny Crow was in a trap and he
[1:32:32] couldn't leave. He couldn't go any
[1:32:33] farther than right
[1:32:35] here. He couldn't go any farther than
[1:32:37] right
[1:32:40] here. But then one day, somebody come
[1:32:43] along and set him free. But Johnny
[1:32:46] didn't even know he was free.
[1:32:52] And Johnny would just stay in the same
[1:32:54] rut, same rut, and watch everybody else
[1:32:56] fly like eagles. And he just couldn't go
[1:32:59] there. He couldn't live that high. He
[1:33:01] could live that high. He can't live. He
[1:33:03] wanted to go south. Come on, Johnny.
[1:33:06] Let's go.
[1:33:08] I'm here to tell you, you're free. And
[1:33:11] if he sets you free, you're free indeed.
[1:33:14] No longer in bondage. No longer to a
[1:33:16] slave mentality. You know what Satan
[1:33:18] does? He tries to put you back in
[1:33:20] bondage in your mind. But you're free
[1:33:22] tonight in Jesus' name. If he set you
[1:33:26] free, if he saved your soul, if he
[1:33:29] filled you with the Holy Ghost, he gave
[1:33:32] you a sound mind.
[1:33:37] Then why don't you take it
[1:33:39] back? David one time looked in the word
[1:33:42] of God and the word of God told him,
[1:33:43] "Take it back." Well, I've been by the
[1:33:45] presence of God, by the anointing of
[1:33:46] God, I tell you, take it back
[1:33:48] tonight. Take back your sound mind.
[1:34:01] He says, brother says this, in the real
[1:34:03] devil, you must recognize he's real. You
[1:34:05] must know he's a devil. Let me finish
[1:34:06] this quote. Then the same time you
[1:34:08] recognize him, you know he's a devil.
[1:34:10] He's against you. Then to overcome, you
[1:34:13] must recognize that God is in you and
[1:34:15] he's greater and mightier than he is.
[1:34:19] And by his grace, you are more than a
[1:34:21] match for him. Amen. There's real
[1:34:24] overcoming when you
[1:34:30] recognize musicians come. Let me
[1:34:34] close so
[1:34:36] much. You got two big messages trying to
[1:34:39] squash them together. That's what you
[1:34:40] get. You don't know where to
[1:34:42] quit. I also know you're
[1:34:47] human. Brother man would say, "Never
[1:34:49] underestimate the power of the devil.
[1:34:53] But I'm going to tell you this too.
[1:34:54] Never underestimate the power of my God.
[1:34:59] Cuz the devil's power is
[1:35:02] limited. It's limited as much as you'll
[1:35:05] let him talk to you. Listen, I'm talking
[1:35:09] about overcoming some mind battles. How
[1:35:11] many's having mind battles? Go ahead and
[1:35:13] raise your hand. It's all right. Just
[1:35:15] identify you're in the same fight we all
[1:35:17] are. Let's agree right now. Lord, I'm
[1:35:20] going to overcome some mind battles.
[1:35:22] Here's how you do it. You take your
[1:35:23] thought that you're getting and where
[1:35:24] it's coming from. You trace it back to
[1:35:27] the origin. And if it doesn't come back
[1:35:28] to the Bible, then you do not have to
[1:35:31] believe it.
[1:35:33] You don't praise it. You don't give it
[1:35:37] don't give it out of your mouth.
[1:35:39] Come on, somebody. Don't give it out of
[1:35:42] your mouth.
[1:35:45] Why? Because the devil knows there's
[1:35:47] power in your mouth. He wants you to
[1:35:50] begin to confess the evil thoughts.
[1:35:52] Brother Ben would teach this. He said,
[1:35:53] "You will get negative thoughts." He
[1:35:55] said, "But never Oh, I got to read it.
[1:35:57] It's too good. Sorry. Let me get it.
[1:35:59] Here we
[1:35:59] go." He says, "When you get to thinking
[1:36:02] about divine healing, get thinking about
[1:36:03] Christ. Keep him on your mind. If
[1:36:05] there's any praise, of any virtue, the
[1:36:06] Bible said, think on these things." If
[1:36:08] any thought comes by, well, maybe it
[1:36:09] couldn't be so. Maybe. Get it off your
[1:36:12] mind right quick. Everybody in the
[1:36:15] building, Lord, help
[1:36:18] me. How many wants the Lord to help them
[1:36:21] do that? Then say it, Lord, help
[1:36:24] me. Think on these things. That's
[1:36:26] positive. Never let a negative thought
[1:36:29] pass through. Just don't let it stop
[1:36:32] anyhow. If it starts through, keep your
[1:36:34] thoughts positive. Jesus, don't think
[1:36:38] sitting there in the wheelchair you're
[1:36:39] hopeless and helpless. You're not. Don't
[1:36:41] let that negative thought ever pass
[1:36:43] through or don't let it anchor. You
[1:36:45] can't help from going through the mind.
[1:36:47] That's right. But don't let it stop. You
[1:36:51] got a double barrel
[1:36:53] shotgun. Say, "Brother Matt, my gun's
[1:36:55] empty." Then go load it up with some
[1:36:59] scriptures. And you take aim at that
[1:37:01] thought and say, "You know what? That
[1:37:02] thought is contrary to the word of
[1:37:05] God." You're never going to live that
[1:37:07] kind of life. You know what? I may not
[1:37:08] be there yet, but I tell you what,
[1:37:09] devil. I think I beat you there. I think
[1:37:12] I beat you there. And I think I beat you
[1:37:13] there. And I think you'll beat you
[1:37:15] there. The Holy Ghost helped me there.
[1:37:16] The Holy Ghost helped me there. The Holy
[1:37:18] Ghost helped me there. And the Holy
[1:37:19] Ghost helped me
[1:37:21] there. And if the Holy Ghost helped me
[1:37:23] there, I'm going to load my gun. One
[1:37:25] more time. I believe Timothy Bruit said
[1:37:27] it like
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:32] this. Why don't you get your double
[1:37:34] barrel shotgun and load it up? And why
[1:37:37] don't you tear that devil right out of
[1:37:39] your mind and let the word of God be
[1:37:42] preeminent in your mind? Let's overcome,
[1:37:44] saints of God.
[1:37:47] Hallelujah.
[1:37:49] Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] Somebody overcome.
[1:37:56] Hallelujah. I'm an
[1:38:01] overcomer by the blood of the lamb.
[1:38:07] and by the
[1:38:08] word of my
[1:38:12] testimony. Overcomer.
[1:38:16] Sing it like you mean it. Oh, I'm
[1:38:22] over by the blood of the
[1:38:26] lamb and by the

[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:34] testimony. Oh, he saved
[1:38:40] me. Oh, he rescued
[1:38:45] me. He delivered
[1:38:50] me. Oh, and he set me free.
[1:38:57] And ever since I've been
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:01] changed. Oh, I've never been the
[1:39:06] same. Oh, I can lift my hands and say
[1:39:11] thank you for this
[1:39:16] grace
[1:39:20] overcomer. Oh, I'm an overcomer.
[1:39:26] Well, by the blood of the

[1:41:04] blood. I'm keen by his love. I'm filled
[1:41:08] with his spirit and by him. Oh, I'm
[1:41:13] here. Sing it to him. Oh
[1:41:17] yes. Oh Jesus gave the
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:23] victory
[1:41:27] overcomer. Oh no.

[1:45:54] conqueror. When brother Matt was saying
[1:45:57] this, I'm taking it back. I'm taking it
[1:46:00] back. Everything that the devil has
[1:46:02] stole from me this evening through my
[1:46:05] life. Can you say that? I'm taking it
[1:46:07] back this evening. Let's try key of F1
[1:46:10] now. Well, I'm taking it

[1:46:58] days, my joy and my peace. Taking it

[1:47:13] home from the city causing li. And while
