[39:57] and this scripture is incredibly
[39:58] powerful
[40:00] and i want us to grab a hold of it for
[40:03] with god
[40:04] nothing shall be impossible
[40:09] for with god nothing

[40:18] unlimited god
[40:21] amen with unlimited vision
[40:29] oh lord our lord psalms 8 and 1
[40:33] how excellent is thy name in all the
[40:36] earth who has set
[40:38] thy glory above the heavens
[40:41] when i consider thy heavens and the work
[40:44] of thy fingers
[40:46] the moon and the stars which thou hast
[40:50] ordained
[40:51] verse 4 what is man that thou art
[40:54] mindful of him
[40:56] and the son of man that thou visiteth
[40:59] him
[41:01] for thou has made him a little lower
[41:04] than
[41:04] the angels and has crowned him with
[41:07] glory and honor
[41:09] thou has thou made us him to have
[41:12] dominion over the works of thy hands
[41:15] thou hast put all things under his feet
[41:19] all sheep oxygen yea the beast of the
[41:22] field
[41:23] the fowl of the air the fish of the sea
[41:27] and whatsoever passes through the paths
[41:30] of the sea
[41:31] oh lord our lord how excellent
[41:35] is thy name in all of the earth
[41:40] john chapter 3 and verse 16 it's on
[41:43] billboards all over the world
[41:45] it should be on every heart for god so
[41:49] loved the world that he gave his only
[41:52] begotten son
[41:54] that whosoever believeth in him should
[41:57] not
[41:57] perish but have everlasting
[42:02] life you may be seated this morning
[42:06] john chapter 1 in verse 1 says in the
[42:09] beginning
[42:10] was the word and the word was with god
[42:12] and the word
[42:14] was god the same was in the beginning
[42:18] with god you want to know god god's in
[42:21] his bible
[42:23] and all things were made by him and
[42:25] without him was not
[42:26] anything made that was made
[42:29] let me tell you how great our god is
[42:33] an invisible god begin to lay it all out
[42:37] in his plan of redemption
[42:39] and he wrote his first bible in the
[42:41] heavens
[42:42] when you look at those stars that are
[42:44] still hanging there they're hanging
[42:46] there
[42:47] since god placed them there
[42:53] they wrote god's first bible now
[42:57] remember this brother branham said he
[42:59] said it was like a halo of
[43:00] light and then that halo of light began
[43:03] to spin and he said
[43:04] one day god spoke and he believed his
[43:08] own word
[43:10] and a son came into existence and then
[43:13] from that sun
[43:14] clinkers began to fall off of it and
[43:16] would fall for maybe
[43:18] millions and millions of light years of
[43:20] miles
[43:21] and it would stop at a certain spot
[43:25] are you with me and then god we
[43:28] understand even today
[43:30] that there's about 70 different
[43:32] universes like ours
[43:36] so our god is unlimited
[43:42] he's not going to run out anytime soon
[43:46] his grace and his mercy and his love
[43:51] everything that god is he is unlimited
[43:54] in and so when we read this
[43:58] all things were made by him and without
[44:01] him was not anything that was made
[44:04] that was made let me just say this to
[44:06] you as a scientist was
[44:08] arguing the theory of god created in the
[44:10] heavens and the earth
[44:11] and brother andrew mentioned it last
[44:12] night the great big bang
[44:14] theory it was a big bank oh yeah
[44:17] i have to agree it was a big game when
[44:20] god does anything it's a big bank
[44:23] but it's not like some scientist darwin
[44:25] theory
[44:28] like this like it was told that the
[44:30] scientist was arguing
[44:32] arguing with god on how god created the
[44:35] heavens and the earth
[44:37] and how that he did it and then finally
[44:39] the god and you know he said took a
[44:40] little dirt and made the earth he said
[44:42] well
[44:43] go get your own dirt
[44:48] in him was life and the life was the
[44:52] light of men
[44:53] and the light shineth in darkness and
[44:56] darkness comprehendeth it was not
[45:00] remember this our god is infinite
[45:08] our god is infinite
[45:11] he's god he's omnipotent
[45:15] he's omnipresent he's a mission
[45:20] he knows all things all wisdom
[45:25] all time covers all space
[45:29] all power he's infinite
[45:33] and if he isn't that he's not god
[45:37] if he's almighty god he can't do all
[45:41] things
[45:41] he's if he's not almighty god
[45:45] but he is almighty god and he
[45:48] can do all things
[45:51] so that's the way we have to believe him
[45:56] are you with me now oh in the great
[46:00] in the beginning god created the heavens
[46:02] and the earth
[46:04] period
[46:08] and the earth was without form and void
[46:11] and darkness
[46:13] was upon the face of the deep and the
[46:16] spirit of god
[46:17] moved upon the face of the waters and
[46:20] god said
[46:21] let there be light and there was light
[46:25] and god saw the light and it was good
[46:27] and god divided the light from the
[46:29] darkness
[46:31] now i want you to understand god don't
[46:33] just do that
[46:35] with the earth he does that with you
[46:42] divided the light from the darkness in
[46:44] your life
[46:46] he took your past and your old man
[46:49] and your first nature and your first
[46:52] marriage
[46:53] and he divided it and it divorced it and
[46:55] it's gone
[46:57] it's annihilated it's as though it never
[46:59] happened in the first place
[47:01] only god can do that no
[47:05] school no teachings of a man no
[47:07] influence of a man can do it
[47:10] god in his transforming power can just
[47:13] literally take the light of his presence
[47:16] and cause your darkness to go away
[47:20] somebody gave him a hand this morning
[47:30] brother branham quoting webster he says
[47:34] he said he's an unlimited power that's
[47:37] right
[47:38] primary is ultimate god is the ultimate
[47:42] and he's unlimited and an ultimate is
[47:46] the
[47:46] amen he has the final word
[47:52] i was a little boy sitting in the church
[47:57] and when when brother jackson would come
[48:00] from
[48:01] south africa and what impressed me is he
[48:05] told a story and i would
[48:07] hear him tell it on a video sometime
[48:09] later and you can you can hear it
[48:11] but anyway sydney jackson would stand in
[48:15] the pulpit and
[48:16] you know as children we catch different
[48:18] things
[48:20] and brother jr was brother sydney was
[48:22] standing there and he says
[48:25] he said what impressed me was we had
[48:28] a couple hundred thousand people that
[48:30] had gathered for the meeting
[48:32] he said you know just to hustle a bustle
[48:34] of noise of people
[48:36] moving backwards and forwards sitting in
[48:38] a service going here going there
[48:41] there's just a there's a kind of just a
[48:44] emotion of people that causes noise
[48:47] he said though they would be silent and
[48:49] not talking it just as emotion of people
[48:51] that causes noise and
[48:53] dogs barking it's an outside meeting
[48:56] animals crying out
[48:58] all kind of all kind of things that was
[49:00] going on he said it was just a lot of
[49:01] noise he said
[49:02] he said well you know we had a lot of
[49:04] speakers come
[49:06] but when brother branham stood there and
[49:09] he said
[49:09] i take every spirit
[49:15] i take every spirit under my control
[49:18] he said i'll tell you it became so
[49:20] silent it was deafening
[49:23] not even a dog bart
[49:28] he said i knew that this was more
[49:33] than a ministry of a man
[49:38] brother branham wasn't god but god sent
[49:40] a messenger to the
[49:43] to exhibit what god was like
[49:48] yes
[49:52] he said what is jesus christ is the same
[49:54] yesterday
[49:56] today and forever
[50:01] his power is unlimited
[50:06] it's limited to your faith but it's not
[50:10] limited to god let me just say when god
[50:14] saves the worst murderer
[50:15] prostitute rapist religious person
[50:20] it does not diminish his power of his
[50:23] blood
[50:24] one little iota
[50:26] [Applause]
[50:27] when god heals the worst cancer patient
[50:31] in the world the worst patient of
[50:33] sickness in the world
[50:35] it does not diminish his power
[50:37] absolutely none
[50:41] you can name your diseases from now to
[50:44] tomorrow
[50:44] i want you to know tonight god's able to
[50:47] meet every one of them
[50:49] when doctors give up that's when god's
[50:52] able to move
[50:53] [Applause]
[50:54] [Music]
[50:58] i love this his i believe his mercies
[51:02] is unlimited
[51:06] i believe that tonight his mercies to
[51:10] you
[51:11] is unlimited
[51:15] i want to thank god for that today
[51:18] because as humans we see our failures we
[51:21] see one another's mistakes
[51:23] we're all pointers we point here point
[51:25] there but with god he looks through the
[51:27] blood of jesus christ
[51:29] and he don't see your sins
[51:33] the power of forgiveness you ask god to
[51:36] forgive you
[51:39] god places it in his blood
[51:43] and he never remembers it ever again
[51:54] a man wanted to argue that point with me
[51:57] at a graveside
[52:00] and he said god you you said god forgets
[52:02] all your sins
[52:05] and he wanted to argue that point
[52:09] and he was gathering himself a little
[52:11] crowd because he was going to
[52:13] make some fun of me he had his own
[52:15] little crew there he was going to make
[52:17] some fun of me
[52:18] and i just looked at him and i said you
[52:20] better hope that god forgets your sins
[52:25] because the woman that you're with that
[52:26] was married to another man
[52:31] and all of a sudden this little crowd
[52:32] just went like that right there
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:45] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[52:47] and forever
[52:48] [Music]
[52:50] that's a phenomenal statement
[52:54] we sometimes let it roll off of our
[52:56] fingertips
[52:58] and we think our our lips and we go we
[53:01] think
[53:02] you know if i was only here when jesus
[53:05] was here
[53:10] if i was only here when jesus was here
[53:13] or if i was only here when brother
[53:14] branham was here
[53:16] or if i was only here when this preacher
[53:18] was here
[53:19] but jesus is the same yesterday today
[53:22] and forever
[53:23] he's not bound by time or space
[53:32] if you can limit god you can limit
[53:34] christ
[53:35] and if you can limit the church today in
[53:38] its possibilities you're limited in god
[53:40] but all things whatsoever you desire
[53:43] when you pray
[53:44] believe that you receive it and you
[53:47] shall have it
[53:48] and he saith i believe it and i
[53:52] know i've told you the truth
[53:58] who holds the worlds
[54:01] in its orbit
[54:06] it is in our president it isn't the
[54:09] dictators of the world
[54:12] they put their pants on just like
[54:14] everybody else does
[54:21] who holds the worlds in this orbits
[54:26] the power of god who holds your
[54:30] soul think about that
[54:33] you say brother ron i just hope he don't
[54:35] lose me i got news for you
[54:38] if he ever thought of you before the
[54:41] foundation of the world
[54:42] he's not some weasley businessman
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:47] that ostracizes you down and no longer
[54:50] wants to deal with you
[54:52] he's got you from from that eternity to
[54:55] that eternity
[54:56] and we came from god and we're going
[54:59] back to god
[55:10] now on the contrast the power of satan
[55:13] is limited
[55:15] he has boundaries he can only go so far
[55:20] if the god that's on the inside of you
[55:23] that came from god is here today
[55:26] you can tell the devil back off
[55:30] you can take god's unlimited word and
[55:33] tell the
[55:33] enemy you back off now
[55:40] the power of god is unlimited
[55:50] you will get exhausted you will get
[55:54] weary
[55:55] you'll get weary and well-doing god
[55:58] don't
[56:00] god is never on vacation
[56:05] god is never turns off if turns off is
[56:08] this do not disturb
[56:09] son god
[56:13] never not hears your prayer
[56:19] every prayer you pray to jesus christ
[56:22] he heals
[56:26] but you remember you're dealing with a
[56:28] god that sees your future
[56:34] so his no is better than yes
[56:39] somebody always somebody ought to look
[56:41] over at your neighbor say boy that's
[56:43] good
[56:45] so god guards you from yourself
[56:49] [Applause]
[56:49] [Music]
[56:52] god guards you from your own selfish
[56:54] ways
[56:55] and your own selfish natures
[56:59] and your pity me party it's not based on
[57:02] your feelings
[57:03] it's not based on your emotions it's not
[57:06] based on do i feel good this morning
[57:09] are we gonna have church or not it's
[57:11] based on the word of god

[57:29] for a miracle and it didn't happen
[57:30] yesterday
[57:31] i got news for you i've been fighting
[57:34] for cancer for a year and a half and he

[57:40] never doubted that i was going to lose
[57:42] to this cancer
[57:44] i'm a winner and god's a
[57:47] healer he's not limited to it
[58:03] just like with sister karen we're not
[58:04] looking for pity we're not looking for

[58:46] he said are you preaching every sunday i
[58:47] said yes sir he said you one tough bird

[59:20] tumor out
[59:22] and he said we're going to do everything

[59:56] hallelujah to god be the glory for
[1:00:00] what he has done

[1:00:22] because i realize those doctors can only

[1:00:27] but they knows there's another presence
[1:00:28] in the room
[1:00:31] are you with me now let me just say this
[1:00:32] you you're never alone i heard brother
[1:00:34] andrew talk about the angels of god that
[1:00:36] are dispatched around you
[1:00:38] you are better protected than the
[1:00:39] president of the united states of
[1:00:41] america
[1:00:42] because remember you got more power than
[1:00:44] the angels of god
[1:00:46] as a son and daughter of god and there's
[1:00:48] angels that dispatch
[1:00:50] to watch over you and nothing happens to
[1:00:54] you
[1:00:54] by chance sure you're going to have some
[1:00:58] trouble
[1:00:59] sure you're going to have some
[1:01:00] heartaches sure you're going to have to
[1:01:03] go through some difficult things
[1:01:04] but you're not going through it by
[1:01:06] yourself
[1:01:08] great up your loins pull your sword you
[1:01:11] were built to fight
[1:01:13] it's unlimited you're built to fight
[1:01:35] we read where a man named sampson took a
[1:01:39] jawbone of an ass
[1:01:41] and he killed a thousand men
[1:01:44] why was it not twenty thousand twenty
[1:01:46] didn't show up
[1:01:47] one dead
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:50] but he could have killed 20 000 with
[1:01:52] this unlimited god
[1:01:55] chapter took a took a six-foot stick
[1:01:59] and killed 600 men why didn't he kill 6
[1:02:02] 000 are you getting it
[1:02:04] because 600 showed up for battle so
[1:02:07] that's how many he killed
[1:02:09] just let the devil go fighting on you
[1:02:12] he never brings enough because you serve
[1:02:16] an unlimited god
[1:02:31] we have an unlimited power for all
[1:02:34] things are possible to them that believe
[1:02:35] in god
[1:02:37] i want you to say it with me for all
[1:02:39] things are possible
[1:02:41] for all things are possible
[1:02:44] to them that believe in god don't you
[1:02:47] walk out of this service whiny and piney
[1:02:49] and
[1:02:52] pity me how bad i got it listen put your
[1:02:55] faith to work
[1:03:03] man standing at the the fuel pump this
[1:03:06] morning looked over said it's a good day
[1:03:08] i said every day is a good day
[1:03:13] every day is a good day and maybe he
[1:03:15] couldn't say it with the depth of
[1:03:17] perception that i can say it with but
[1:03:19] every day
[1:03:20] is a good day
[1:03:21] [Applause]
[1:03:27] amen you know i was told some time ago
[1:03:30] brother brahma says that
[1:03:31] they had a jet plane and it makes them
[1:03:34] noise as we hear this shakes the windows
[1:03:37] it's a plane that's got so fast that it
[1:03:40] crosses its sound barrier
[1:03:43] you'll like it sandra and when it goes
[1:03:46] beyond its own sound barrier
[1:03:48] it's almost unlimited to what it'll do
[1:03:53] and i think in there that we get a
[1:03:55] lesson
[1:03:56] when we go beyond our own
[1:04:00] sound barrier into the word of god then
[1:04:04] it's
[1:04:05] unlimited what god can do with the man
[1:04:08] that's ready to go beyond the camp
[1:04:10] the camp of man that is and we see
[1:04:14] that going beyond the camp unlimited
[1:04:26] it's just like when the lord
[1:04:30] he's got a remedy for all these things
[1:04:35] he's got a remedy for sin
[1:04:41] i sent andrew a little deal the other
[1:04:44] day that dropped in my heart i haven't
[1:04:46] preached it yet but i'll
[1:04:47] i'll give it to you free here right now
[1:04:50] the scripture says that there's no
[1:04:53] temptation
[1:04:57] no temptation to a believer that catches
[1:05:00] them unaware
[1:05:01] but god makes a way of escape for him
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:06] and you're going to be tempted in your
[1:05:08] life because every son and daughter that
[1:05:10] comes to god
[1:05:12] god makes a way of escape for you
[1:05:15] but when you are in the trap
[1:05:18] the interruptions while the trial is
[1:05:22] going on is interruptions to catch your
[1:05:25] attention
[1:05:26] to get you out
[1:05:29] [Music]
[1:05:32] thank god for the interruptions that
[1:05:35] remind you

[1:07:24] go entertain me
[1:07:26] this ain't an entertainment deal here

[1:07:44] to church like it's an entertainment
[1:07:46] the song leader ain't right they go well
[1:07:49] it's just
[1:07:50] didn't sing their song the preacher
[1:07:52] didn't say nothing that was
[1:07:54] entertaining to them and yet they can go
[1:07:56] home and watch a three-hour moody
[1:07:58] movie that's got a bad ending anyway
[1:08:04] the same people that'll go to the
[1:08:06] bathroom 14 times here
[1:08:08] sit there three hours
[1:08:20] well it's too loud here what did you do
[1:08:22] with your rock and roll music
[1:08:24] years ago you'd blow people out of your
[1:08:27] car
[1:08:28] and then you complained because we got a
[1:08:30] little bit of noise around here
[1:08:32] [Applause]
[1:08:34] brother branham said if you don't like
[1:08:36] noise don't go to heaven
[1:08:38] he said it's going to be the noisiest
[1:08:40] place that you've ever been
[1:08:50] hallelujah
[1:09:11] i want you to watch the prophet of god
[1:09:16] and this in this in this quote i want
[1:09:17] you to break very deeply think
[1:09:20] of where we are right now
[1:09:26] and he's speaking in 1964
[1:09:29] or five he said if einstein
[1:09:34] had only had a spiritual application
[1:09:40] as a physical actor application
[1:09:44] as he studied the laws of light and so
[1:09:48] forth
[1:09:50] he could have told us something amen
[1:09:56] when i heard his message on that
[1:09:59] great sinner somewhere in
[1:10:02] into the skies that
[1:10:06] ever contacted with that center
[1:10:09] you could create earths
[1:10:13] do anything and the power
[1:10:18] would be unlimited
[1:10:21] you see he had seen that
[1:10:27] and he said you see these little pockets
[1:10:29] going through the air
[1:10:31] they call them saucers
[1:10:34] so forth people so that
[1:10:37] well we better leave that one alone he
[1:10:40] said
[1:10:41] hear all these people coming up missing
[1:10:44] you say don't hear from them they're
[1:10:48] standing there
[1:10:50] and they're not there
[1:10:53] now watch what he's going to do with
[1:10:54] this that's the way
[1:10:56] the rapture's going to be
[1:11:00] one of them will drop right down and
[1:11:03] this terrestrial body
[1:11:05] will take on a celestial body
[1:11:09] and they'll they'll be hair or bones
[1:11:13] left it'll be transformed
[1:11:17] in a moment of time dropping
[1:11:20] right out of space and taking home that
[1:11:23] and we
[1:11:24] see all this going on now
[1:11:27] and the pentagon wondering about these
[1:11:30] lights
[1:11:37] now i don't know about you but i'm not
[1:11:38] crazy
[1:11:40] they have denied it
[1:11:44] until this year
[1:11:49] they have denied and i'm not
[1:11:52] speaking to you something out of turn
[1:11:55] our government
[1:11:56] has denied flying saucers
[1:12:02] all of this time now listen don't get
[1:12:05] scared right here
[1:12:06] brother branham said they were
[1:12:07] investigating angels
[1:12:12] and i find it interesting that an
[1:12:15] unlimited
[1:12:15] god now i want you to just think about
[1:12:19] this
[1:12:20] coal was never used
[1:12:23] until this day the weight has been used
[1:12:26] it has laid in the earth since the
[1:12:30] foundation of the world
[1:12:34] and man tapped into it in this day all
[1:12:37] has been in the earth and man tapped
[1:12:40] into it in this day
[1:12:47] it is unlimited what god put in this
[1:12:50] earth
[1:12:55] but your body was laying in the earth
[1:12:59] and you were born at a certain time in a
[1:13:02] certain day
[1:13:03] and your mother ate your body out of the
[1:13:06] earth
[1:13:09] and there's a statement we can use right
[1:13:11] here there's no place like home
[1:13:16] because that's where you came from
[1:13:25] so we have a prophet of god standing
[1:13:28] not in the best suit necessarily
[1:13:33] are not necessarily in a group of
[1:13:35] believers like i'm preaching to today
[1:13:38] but he simply drops down truths that the
[1:13:41] world's trying to figure about flying
[1:13:43] saucers
[1:13:45] and he just simply says they're
[1:13:46] investigating angels
[1:13:51] well brother ron we we've watched a
[1:13:53] million broadcast on
[1:13:54] what uvfo's are and brother branham
[1:13:57] takes about two minutes
[1:13:59] it just tells you what's that got to do
[1:14:02] in a sermon on unlimited
[1:14:09] don't you just think about what's that
[1:14:10] got to do with the sermon on unlimited
[1:14:14] god has the answer to
[1:14:17] every question
[1:14:25] he says in leadership he said education
[1:14:28] is coming to its end where are we
[1:14:32] at
[1:14:35] science is coming to its end
[1:14:40] he sat on the he sat up there on a log
[1:14:42] with brother branham
[1:14:43] with brother bischoff and he told him he
[1:14:46] said
[1:14:46] he said these great big meetings they're
[1:14:49] coming to their end
[1:14:52] brother biscuit said i thought i thought
[1:14:56] they're just getting started he said
[1:14:59] they're coming to their end and you know
[1:15:01] what they started having bigger meetings
[1:15:04] and bigger meetings and
[1:15:05] and all of a sudden they're just gone
[1:15:08] i'm a sign
[1:15:09] a surprise to god
[1:15:13] are you with me now brother brandon went
[1:15:15] around the world
[1:15:16] seven times he never preached in message
[1:15:19] churches like we're sitting tonight
[1:15:23] they were full gospel businessmen
[1:15:25] meetings
[1:15:26] and they were maybe a pentecostal church
[1:15:29] that would bring him in
[1:15:30] or maybe another church that would bring
[1:15:32] him in and they would fill the place
[1:15:36] and he would preach to them the truth
[1:15:39] whether it was in switzerland or
[1:15:40] finland or south africa or india or
[1:15:43] jeffersonville
[1:15:44] or here in harrisonburg
[1:15:46] [Applause]
[1:15:48] brother branham went to a couple local
[1:15:50] places here
[1:15:51] they didn't want it
[1:15:54] but an unlimited god knew you were here
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:16:01] are you with me well where are the
[1:16:04] believers brother ron
[1:16:05] they're here
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:10] they're here they're in zimbabwe
[1:16:14] they're in south africa they're in japan
[1:16:18] they're in china and china can try to
[1:16:20] shut them down all they want to
[1:16:22] but a believer is a believer no matter
[1:16:25] what pressure that they're under
[1:16:35] wash women that washed old people
[1:16:38] in the they would go to bath houses and
[1:16:41] that that was their occupation
[1:16:43] they washed people for living
[1:16:46] that was some of the people that sat
[1:16:48] there doctors
[1:16:50] and liars how physicians were there
[1:16:58] a lady come across the prayer line
[1:17:01] amongst hundreds
[1:17:03] came across in a prayer line i prayed
[1:17:05] for and i stopped her
[1:17:07] and i i can't speak chinese because a
[1:17:10] woman stands about this tall
[1:17:13] and i said just a moment you're a lady
[1:17:14] of influence
[1:17:18] and you've come to see a living god and
[1:17:20] he said you're over a whole lot of
[1:17:22] people
[1:17:25] that woman was a doctor
[1:17:30] over a phenomenal facility
[1:17:33] but she also was a woman
[1:17:36] that had a hundred underground churches
[1:17:42] you see i didn't know that god knew that
[1:17:50] sometimes you think you come to church
[1:17:52] and you go well
[1:17:53] you know i'm coming in i'm sitting down
[1:17:55] and that preacher came to my kitchen he
[1:17:57] came to my living room
[1:17:58] you see the word is a discerner of the
[1:18:02] thoughts of the heart
[1:18:05] and you're sitting there and all of a
[1:18:06] sudden you know
[1:18:08] that god's in your room
[1:18:12] and there's hundreds of people in the
[1:18:13] same place but god's speaking to you
[1:18:17] do you know when god calls your name
[1:18:19] your attention comes up
[1:18:21] or it calls your attention your
[1:18:22] circumstance your attention already
[1:18:24] begins to say
[1:18:26] that's more than brother ron or that's
[1:18:28] more than brother tim freud
[1:18:29] or that's more than
[1:18:31] [Applause]
[1:18:33] more than a man comes
[1:18:46] i'd like to get that i'd like to get
[1:18:48] that ringtone on my phone
[1:18:52] i've got a race car
[1:18:55] but the man said this he said you see
[1:18:57] the one difference between israel and
[1:18:59] the rest of the nations
[1:19:02] is god
[1:19:09] i want to just say something here people
[1:19:13] moved as
[1:19:14] as literally they moved from one place
[1:19:17] to another and took the same cows
[1:19:19] that was back in their home country and
[1:19:22] they took them to israel
[1:19:24] and they gave 20 percent more milk in
[1:19:26] israel

[1:27:07] you in good company but i'm trying to
[1:27:09] give you an example
[1:27:11] one of the best examples is to go to a
[1:27:13] person's pocketbook
[1:27:15] to tell them that god owns it all
[1:27:19] so what is a few cows to give you
[1:27:23] if you owned it all jesus didn't need
[1:27:25] just america
[1:27:27] and he didn't just need russia or israel
[1:27:30] he
[1:27:30] owned it all so satan can make him an
[1:27:33] offer i'll give you the kingdoms of the
[1:27:35] world i
[1:27:36] already own it i already own it
[1:27:41] why would i give up what i own
[1:27:59] you see i had to go on a fishing
[1:28:01] expedition to try to get you to see that
[1:28:03] god is unlimited
[1:28:05] and when jesus was standing there on the
[1:28:08] mount of temptation
[1:28:09] and satan was making him an offer
[1:28:14] he was making him offer i'll give you
[1:28:16] america i'll give you russia
[1:28:18] he already owned it
[1:28:20] [Music]
[1:28:22] he already owned it young people you say
[1:28:25] well i'm gonna get mr america for a
[1:28:28] husband
[1:28:29] you can have him
[1:28:42] today he looks like a coke bottle figure
[1:28:47] come back in 20 years
[1:28:51] come back in 20 years when his hair is
[1:28:53] gray and his teeth are out and he can't
[1:28:55] see past
[1:28:56] his nose
[1:29:04] i'm not going to do that to the sisters
[1:29:06] because it's my wife's birthday
[1:29:08] god knows i don't want to make her day
[1:29:10] badge
[1:29:14] i want you to listen to this quote god
[1:29:17] don't make mistakes
[1:29:26] won't you turn to your neighbor and say
[1:29:28] i ain't a mistake
