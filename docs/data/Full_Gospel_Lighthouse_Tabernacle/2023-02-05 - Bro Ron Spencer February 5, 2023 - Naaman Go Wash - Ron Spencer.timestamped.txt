[52:13] doctors are doing their best to extend
[52:15] his life
[52:17] trying to bring him back to a normalcy
[52:20] but there's a high position in this room
[52:22] [Music]
[52:24] that can do blood transplants in a
[52:26] moment
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] Lord I just ask you that you touch him
[52:31] today
[52:33] the hands that went up
[52:37] went up Lord you know our names and our
[52:38] addresses no doubt it would if we were
[52:41] sitting in brother branham's meeting
[52:43] and he would call our name
[52:45] you sit in there
[52:48] if this would increase your faith
[52:50] call your name
[52:52] maybe tell you where you're from your
[52:54] condition what the doctor says
[52:57] then you would know that God knows
[53:00] we're a material audience we know that
[53:03] our lord Jesus knows everything about us
[53:06] now we just invite you to the Pew this
[53:09] evening that you touch our hearts
[53:12] come by and minister to us
[53:14] Lord as I stand here I need your help
[53:17] today I need your touch physically
[53:21] Lord I just pray that you would anoint
[53:23] this audience
[53:25] Lord and brother Gideon
[53:28] Lord he has crossed over to that which
[53:30] he has preached about for all of these
[53:32] years
[53:33] no doubt maybe his father was the first
[53:36] one that stood there for him
[53:39] to shake his hand and say welcome home
[53:42] now Lord Jesus I ask you to be with his
[53:45] wife
[53:46] be with his his audience that he has
[53:49] preached to all these years and labored
[53:51] I pray that you had strengthened them
[53:53] today
[53:55] Lord and now may we all look to you
[53:59] look to you that that today would be a
[54:03] stronger day with Jesus Christ
[54:06] if we don't know you Lord before the
[54:08] service is over
[54:10] may we come to know you
[54:12] more than a story more than a picture
[54:14] more than somebody else's testimony but
[54:18] now let it become ours in Jesus Christ's
[54:21] name we pray
[54:22] [Music]
[54:24] amen God bless you we certainly love you
[54:27] with all of our hearts it need good to
[54:29] us
[54:31] amen if you would turn with me to Second
[54:33] Kings chapter 5 and verse 1.
[54:40] second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1. amen
[54:44] brother Chris Sister Mary we're glad to
[54:46] have you back from your little time away
[54:48] and amen the son done you good yeah yeah
[54:52] only thing I have to say is to your next
[54:54] time invite me so
[54:57] it'd be a lot of miracles happen on that
[55:00] one but uh
[55:08] second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1.
[55:12] now Naaman
[55:14] captain of the host of the king of Syria
[55:18] was a great man
[55:20] with his master and honorable
[55:23] because by him the Lord had given
[55:25] Deliverance unto Syria
[55:28] he was also a mighty man in Valor
[55:32] but
[55:34] he was a leper you can be seated
[55:44] before brother Wendell Martin came and
[55:46] spoke to us it was on Wednesday of that
[55:49] week
[55:51] and I was on the treadmill in the
[55:53] morning and and I was doing my normal
[55:56] morning walk
[55:58] and I walk about two two and a half
[56:00] miles every morning on the treadmill and
[56:03] and uh I I it's just a good time for me
[56:07] to listen to sermons talk to the Lord
[56:10] pray I try to do it before anybody else
[56:13] gets up
[56:14] but I
[56:17] particular morning the Lord spoke to me
[56:21] and I say that with Incredible reverence
[56:23] the Lord spoke to me to speak what I
[56:25] spoke
[56:26] last Sunday and it didn't have to be
[56:29] that way
[56:31] the second part of that when he spoke to
[56:34] me he spoke to me to revisit and this
[56:36] was the words that he said revisit
[56:39] Naaman again so this morning we're we're
[56:43] fulfilling that part
[56:46] and so as we begin to look at it I I
[56:49] want you to just go Lord come to my Pew
[56:52] there's a reason that brother Branham
[56:54] brother Ron is having to speak this and
[56:56] so just just ask the Lord to come to
[56:59] your home and to your family and your
[57:01] situation maybe just an application to
[57:04] one person maybe even on the internet
[57:06] but but we're we're just asking the Lord
[57:09] to come by our way today
[57:11] now we understand that Naaman was a was
[57:14] a great man
[57:15] being a great man a great leader he was
[57:17] a war hero
[57:19] he had actually fulfilled a portion of
[57:24] Elijah's prophecy to which Ahab would be
[57:28] slain
[57:29] and he was a fulfillment of one of the
[57:33] Miracles that took place under Elijah
[57:36] now we would find that he would be a a
[57:40] portion of a miracle under Elisha now
[57:44] where it has importance to us today is
[57:47] is the spirit of Elijah it's the spirit
[57:50] of God
[57:52] five a different appearings of Elijah
[57:54] and we know that's Elijah Elisha John
[57:57] the Baptist and then our messenger
[57:59] brother Branham and then there's Elijah
[58:01] that is going to come back to the Jews
[58:04] and so we realize that it's God's spirit
[58:07] and so we we watch as Elisha is there
[58:12] and he is the prophet that is in the
[58:15] land and and no doubt is very notable
[58:17] and many people know about him and know
[58:20] that God is real
[58:22] and no doubt Naaman did not realize that
[58:26] he had fulfilled prophecy
[58:29] he had been a portion of a warrior that
[58:32] had fulfilled prophecy to which that
[58:34] that Elijah had spoke about
[58:37] when he became home no doubt there was
[58:39] celebrations that that Syria was set
[58:42] free and and and no doubt as he's
[58:45] raising in the ranks and he becomes into
[58:47] a position that he is in the king's
[58:50] Chambers very regularly he is there and
[58:53] and as he's there he's he's constantly
[58:57] in the secret rooms that are taking
[58:59] place and and this man is uh most
[59:02] notable he's he's kind of a man that
[59:04] would be known in his community as as
[59:07] one of those men that everybody looks up
[59:10] to
[59:12] but Naaman had a secret
[59:17] Naaman had a secret
[59:19] and being as dignified and as a much of
[59:22] a warrior hero that he was as much as he
[59:26] had fulfilled the plan of God in his
[59:28] situation
[59:30] he was carrying a secret
[59:33] it was a secret if it was known
[59:37] he would have been exiled
[59:40] he would have no longer been a war hero
[59:43] he would have no longer had access to
[59:46] the king the men that were around him
[59:49] would have never looked up to him
[59:52] his family would have had to Exile him
[59:56] and send him away and he would have
[59:59] lived a very horrible life
[1:00:02] can you imagine the difficulty of
[1:00:06] concealing leprosy
[1:00:08] leprosy is a disease to where your flesh
[1:00:11] rots it is a disease where your fingers
[1:00:14] and your arms fall off it is disease to
[1:00:18] where your muscles deteriorate and it
[1:00:21] comes it comes with great stench
[1:00:25] yeah yeah
[1:00:27] yeah can you imagine the difficulty of
[1:00:30] keeping this a secret
[1:00:37] he didn't want to go into exile
[1:00:40] so he had to hold this
[1:00:42] but while he was
[1:00:45] away in battle
[1:00:48] he had brought home a girl
[1:00:51] and this girl was in his home and
[1:00:54] she had came from the territory to where
[1:00:57] Ahab was killed
[1:01:00] her family was was great believers
[1:01:03] now she becomes a lady mistress in the
[1:01:06] home to help take care of the home and
[1:01:08] take care of the family she's a young
[1:01:11] girl
[1:01:12] and being a young girl she's now away
[1:01:15] from her family she's away from her home
[1:01:21] she's living in these incredible
[1:01:23] conditions
[1:01:25] no doubt no doubt Naaman was good to her
[1:01:29] no doubt whatever she needed he would
[1:01:31] give it to her but it wasn't home
[1:01:35] it wasn't a place to where that that she
[1:01:38] could feel comfortable to worship God
[1:01:41] this girl sitting in this home was a
[1:01:44] real believer
[1:01:45] though she be an alien from her
[1:01:48] community in her country she was a real
[1:01:51] believer let me just say if you've got
[1:01:53] the goods
[1:01:55] it'll live no matter what school that
[1:01:57] you're in no matter what job that you're
[1:02:00] on
[1:02:03] the Holy Ghost in America is the Holy
[1:02:05] Ghost in Africa the Holy Ghost in
[1:02:08] Switzerland it's the Holy Ghost
[1:02:10] everywhere you're at the message of the
[1:02:13] hour works here it works all over the
[1:02:16] world
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:18] oh
[1:02:20] it's the same message it's the same God
[1:02:22] it's the same Holy Ghost living inside
[1:02:25] of our lives
[1:02:27] no doubt she watched Naaman as he would
[1:02:30] close the door and begin to take his
[1:02:32] armor off
[1:02:35] you know your family realizes what
[1:02:37] you're going through
[1:02:40] he could hold it a secret to the world
[1:02:42] but he couldn't hold it a secret to his
[1:02:44] family
[1:02:45] and he would release the bandages and
[1:02:48] release the gauze from his body the
[1:02:50] stench would fill the room
[1:02:54] you can imagine what it was like
[1:02:57] cancer has a smell
[1:03:00] cancer has an odor that goes with it
[1:03:06] can you imagine much worse than that
[1:03:10] leprosy
[1:03:15] this is a miracle that Jesus will
[1:03:17] actually recall
[1:03:20] of Naamans
[1:03:21] being healed of leprosy
[1:03:25] maybe you don't have leprosy of the
[1:03:27] flesh today
[1:03:29] but leprosy of sin
[1:03:33] let pursue of bad habits
[1:03:36] secrets today you can have a phone full
[1:03:40] of pornography
[1:03:43] locked away from even family or a
[1:03:46] computer at home with that kind of
[1:03:48] nonsense sin can be so secretive but can
[1:03:52] be so destructive
[1:03:56] I I recall and I just want to just share
[1:03:59] a couple of things with you
[1:04:01] when brother Branham would have
[1:04:03] communion
[1:04:05] in his local assembly there in
[1:04:07] Jeffersonville
[1:04:09] before he would serve communion
[1:04:12] he would go around from house to house
[1:04:14] maybe not to everyone but he would go to
[1:04:16] house to house and tell them before you
[1:04:19] take communion get this right
[1:04:22] get this right
[1:04:25] and and maybe maybe you couldn't handle
[1:04:28] an individual like that but I would be
[1:04:30] grateful to God
[1:04:33] I'd be grateful to God that the prophet
[1:04:36] would come to me and say brother Ron
[1:04:39] would you get that right in your life
[1:04:42] I don't know anything in mind but but
[1:04:44] would you get that right in your life
[1:04:46] just get that taken care of because God
[1:04:49] sees it
[1:04:51] sometimes when you're hearing the
[1:04:52] preaching of the word and and you're
[1:04:54] thinking somebody told but it's a higher
[1:04:56] power that's coming down your Avenue
[1:05:00] and is coming to right where you're at
[1:05:02] and it's your opportunity
[1:05:04] it's your time to say God I want to get
[1:05:07] that right right now how long does it
[1:05:09] take
[1:05:10] just a moment
[1:05:12] father forgive me I'll never revisit
[1:05:15] that thing again in my life I'll not
[1:05:17] want that habit in my life
[1:05:21] but you could easily Rebel
[1:05:24] you could easily say that's none of your
[1:05:26] business you could easily say God I I I
[1:05:29] I don't want to do it do that
[1:05:33] but how close that we can come to the
[1:05:35] presence of God at our pride
[1:05:38] an evil spirit grab a hold of us and
[1:05:41] take us another way
[1:05:43] never to be remembered of any more
[1:05:46] literally pulled off of the scene
[1:05:53] two different instances
[1:05:56] that I would recall this morning
[1:05:58] wouldn't dare call names
[1:06:01] but in a prayer line
[1:06:03] there was a lady that was there
[1:06:06] had hair extremely long
[1:06:09] and she just said I I want the Holy
[1:06:12] Ghost she'd said in churches for years
[1:06:14] I want the holy ghost in my life
[1:06:19] Spirit of the Lord revealed to her that
[1:06:21] if you'll quit dating your boss
[1:06:30] if you'll quit dating your boss and
[1:06:31] wanting to leave your husband for that
[1:06:33] man
[1:06:35] and you'll make that right God will give
[1:06:36] you the Holy Ghost
[1:06:39] her pastor was standing right beside of
[1:06:41] me
[1:06:43] he would tell me he said I've been hurt
[1:06:45] I've been her pastor for decades and I
[1:06:48] didn't know it
[1:06:50] I said people can live a secret life
[1:06:52] it's not your fault Brother Ray you
[1:06:55] preached the truth all these years
[1:06:58] it's not your fault
[1:07:00] another place I was speaking and prayer
[1:07:03] line was taking place and
[1:07:05] a girl came and
[1:07:07] she was one in a deep experience with
[1:07:10] God
[1:07:11] and God spoke to her and said
[1:07:14] you're getting ready to commit suicide
[1:07:18] and you're dating a married man
[1:07:21] and you borrowed his gun to commit
[1:07:24] suicide with she just fell in the floor
[1:07:28] you see no man notes that but God knows
[1:07:35] that's watching over our lives
[1:07:37] for both of those individuals it was an
[1:07:40] extension of life for them
[1:07:43] are you with me now I don't know the end
[1:07:45] of the story but I don't know what they
[1:07:47] will do with that in the end that's not
[1:07:49] mine to do but I know a God that can
[1:07:52] change your life this day this service
[1:07:55] yeah
[1:07:58] in this very moment he can change your
[1:08:01] life
[1:08:05] this man being a a public figure
[1:08:09] a man of great stature goes home and his
[1:08:13] family knows all about the secret that
[1:08:15] he's carrying
[1:08:17] they know no doubt they have great
[1:08:20] respect for him but they know what's
[1:08:22] going on
[1:08:25] and he comes in and he unwraps
[1:08:27] and that little girl sees him
[1:08:30] in that condition
[1:08:32] now she though she be an alien in
[1:08:35] another country
[1:08:37] though she be under captivity
[1:08:40] though she being a servant to this man
[1:08:45] she could have
[1:08:47] withheld Mercy
[1:08:51] she could have just said good enough for
[1:08:53] him
[1:08:57] good enough for him he's taken me
[1:08:59] captive good enough for him
[1:09:03] let him die let him rot
[1:09:06] let him just go away but there was
[1:09:09] something greater about the message of
[1:09:11] the hour that she had talked in her
[1:09:14] heart
[1:09:17] she said there's a prophet in our land
[1:09:19] in my home country his name is Elisha
[1:09:24] and if you could get to him
[1:09:26] God could heal you of that dreadic
[1:09:29] disease
[1:09:32] now I want you to understand
[1:09:34] no person had ever been healed of
[1:09:38] leprosy to that point
[1:09:41] not one not under Elijah not under
[1:09:44] Elisha but this little girl believed the
[1:09:48] principle of God all things are possible
[1:09:53] and under that all things are possible
[1:09:56] leprosy is possible
[1:09:59] first stage cancer is possible
[1:10:03] restoring marriages is possible
[1:10:07] overcoming every devil in hell is
[1:10:10] possible when the devil tells you it's
[1:10:13] impossible I want you to know our God
[1:10:17] takes care of the impossibility
[1:10:20] foreign
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:36] how do I get to such a man
[1:10:39] go see him
[1:10:43] go see him
[1:10:50] Naaman writes her letter to the king
[1:10:55] because he knows
[1:10:57] that his presence
[1:11:01] in that country who will call for war
[1:11:07] can you imagine that
[1:11:09] him coming as a Victor over you now
[1:11:13] you've come back
[1:11:15] what are you doing here
[1:11:19] so Naaman does like a lot of church
[1:11:21] members do
[1:11:23] I'll do it my way
[1:11:26] whether you know this or not in the
[1:11:29] satanic world
[1:11:31] the number one song that they use is I
[1:11:34] Did It My Way
[1:11:38] it's always been that way
[1:11:41] Lucifer did it his way
[1:11:45] your enemy is your own self-will
[1:11:48] so you wrestle with your own self-will
[1:11:51] my way if I'm going to be healed I want
[1:11:55] to do it my way
[1:11:57] so he gets granted permission from the
[1:11:59] King to go see the king of Israel and
[1:12:02] when he goes to see the king there even
[1:12:05] that King riches close
[1:12:09] in the presence of Nema what's he doing
[1:12:12] here is there a war getting ready to
[1:12:14] take place
[1:12:21] he thinks that no doubt the king will
[1:12:23] call for Elisha
[1:12:25] to come
[1:12:27] well let me just remind you something
[1:12:29] about the spirit of Elijah
[1:12:32] they're not politicians
[1:12:38] brother Brandon was not politically
[1:12:40] correct either
[1:12:42] but if we could go back further than
[1:12:44] that Jesus wasn't politically correct
[1:12:49] sometimes we say difficult things from
[1:12:52] the pulpit
[1:12:53] and people go well brother Ron that's
[1:12:55] kind of a hate speech kind of thing have
[1:12:57] you read John 8
[1:13:01] have you read John chapter 8 where Jesus
[1:13:04] calls them devils
[1:13:06] Beelzebub you're of your father the
[1:13:09] devil the highest men of all the
[1:13:12] churches he calls them devils
[1:13:15] he was not a politician
[1:13:19] and let me just say when we're screaming
[1:13:21] out come out of this those denominations
[1:13:23] let me just say it we're not doing that
[1:13:26] in hate we're doing that in life
[1:13:30] we don't want to see people go to the
[1:13:32] tribulation period
[1:13:34] we don't want to see them because the
[1:13:37] scripture says come out of her be not a
[1:13:39] partaker of her place
[1:13:41] sure I've got great friends there I got
[1:13:44] great buddies in those systems it's not
[1:13:46] the people it's the spirit of the system
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:52] and the system has told God we don't
[1:13:54] need you
[1:13:57] [Music]
[1:14:00] very weird
[1:14:03] foreign
[1:14:09] shows up and he takes his Caravan and
[1:14:11] takes all of his money and his jewelries
[1:14:13] and takes his talents of silver
[1:14:20] you know because Elisha wouldn't come to
[1:14:22] the king's chamber
[1:14:24] that wasn't in his agenda
[1:14:29] one of the double portion Miracles is on
[1:14:33] its way
[1:14:34] amen
[1:14:35] when Elisha was a following Elijah
[1:14:40] Elijah asked him said what do you desire
[1:14:42] of me he said I want a double portion
[1:14:46] of what you have
[1:14:48] a double portion twice as many miracles
[1:14:52] as what you have
[1:14:55] now one of those double portions is on
[1:14:59] the way
[1:15:01] but Elisha is alone isolated with God
[1:15:08] sometimes we want preachers to be the
[1:15:11] guy that patched the babies and hugs
[1:15:13] everybody and shakes everybody's hands
[1:15:15] and tell them how much they love them
[1:15:17] they want a buddy for they don't really
[1:15:19] want a pastor they want a buddy
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:27] brother Birmingham said you got to be a
[1:15:29] man that's isolated to God
[1:15:33] and and just like brother Branham had to
[1:15:35] go to Arizona because the vision
[1:15:37] commanded him to go to Arizona and he
[1:15:40] would be there and and they would be
[1:15:42] picking a cocklebur off
[1:15:44] he was there when the seals were
[1:15:47] revealed he was in an isolated condition
[1:15:50] to where God could speak to him and then
[1:15:52] he would come back let me just say it
[1:15:54] wouldn't be just one miracle
[1:15:56] but God was going to open the entire
[1:15:59] Bible
[1:16:01] to the Bride of Jesus Christ and now she
[1:16:04] would be known as people of an open book
[1:16:08] and let me just explain this to you when
[1:16:11] you're thinking about this this may be
[1:16:12] very Elementary but there's schools all
[1:16:15] over the world of schools of theology
[1:16:20] Great Wall structures of Theology and
[1:16:23] they've been there for hundreds of years
[1:16:25] but they couldn't open this book
[1:16:28] but God sent Elijah the prophet to you
[1:16:34] and listen no better to open the book
[1:16:36] than the author of the book
[1:16:39] and when he begins to speak through the
[1:16:42] vessel
[1:16:44] it was more than the voice of William
[1:16:46] Branham but it was the voice of Jesus
[1:16:49] Christ now that voice is thundering in
[1:16:53] the bride
[1:16:55] not just in the ministry but in you
[1:16:59] [Applause]
[1:17:09] Elijah Elijah's hid away
[1:17:16] and when they come to the house you can
[1:17:17] imagine
[1:17:19] you can imagine Naaman felt like you
[1:17:22] know he was somebody
[1:17:27] this prophet
[1:17:29] he'll come out and maybe bow at my feet
[1:17:33] profit will provide a great feast
[1:17:37] maybe he'll do a lot of things he had
[1:17:38] probably a lot of false illusions
[1:17:47] Elisha didn't even come out
[1:17:51] now wouldn't you be mad
[1:17:54] you've made this journey
[1:17:56] and that prophet
[1:17:59] wouldn't even come out
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:07] he wouldn't come out to see him
[1:18:09] I'm dying here I'm rotten away I'm the
[1:18:13] one that that fulfilled the prophecy
[1:18:17] look who I am
[1:18:20] he wasn't interested in who he was
[1:18:23] his political stature didn't bother him
[1:18:25] none whatsoever
[1:18:28] the Hazel went back in and told him no
[1:18:30] doubt what law was going on and he said
[1:18:32] tell him to go wash
[1:18:35] go wash in the muddy river of Jordan go
[1:18:39] down there wash and don't just dip one
[1:18:42] time but you dip seven times
[1:18:48] now listen when gehaza goes out and
[1:18:51] gives him this news he don't tell him
[1:18:53] now you're well
[1:18:56] go home be well no he told him go to the
[1:19:00] Jordan
[1:19:02] in that muddy Jordan which means death
[1:19:05] go to that Crossing and when you get
[1:19:08] down there go completely under you dip
[1:19:12] in that water seven times
[1:19:18] Naaman didn't start shouting
[1:19:21] he got mad
[1:19:25] got mad
[1:19:31] you mean I can't go to my own church
[1:19:35] and get baptized in father-son Holy
[1:19:37] Ghost
[1:19:39] you mean I can't believe in three gods
[1:19:42] you mean I can't go back to my polished
[1:19:45] Pastor that reads me poems and says
[1:19:48] quiet prayers and
[1:19:51] quote Spurgeon for a while you mean I
[1:19:54] gotta go to a messy church and I go to
[1:19:57] who I message alter and I gotta get born
[1:20:00] again and I Gotta Die out to my sins and
[1:20:03] I got to be baptized in the name of the
[1:20:05] Lord Jesus Christ and I got to receive
[1:20:07] the Holy Ghost to get this sin out of my
[1:20:11] life and to make the resurrection and
[1:20:14] make the Rapture that's what I gotta do
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:22] come here
[1:20:28] I'm a little bit more dignified than
[1:20:30] that I don't want to do this I want to
[1:20:32] go to the beautiful I want to go to the
[1:20:34] beautiful ponds the healings Waters I
[1:20:37] want to go to the Warm Springs
[1:20:42] I want to do it my way
[1:20:45] can't you go back in and negotiate let
[1:20:48] me just say you don't negotiate with God
[1:20:51] God changed you a word you just you just
[1:20:55] believe it you just accept it
[1:21:07] the guys with him said

[1:25:44] the embarrassment out of our lives
[1:25:46] [Applause]
[1:26:00] secrets to live in homes
[1:26:05] there was a man came here and he made
[1:26:07] fun of our worship
[1:26:13] on Saturday night we had a Jericho March
[1:26:17] we shouted we danced
[1:26:20] brother Homer
[1:26:23] the first edition of Homer
[1:26:30] was singing
[1:26:32] and shouting
[1:26:34] holding his ear
[1:26:41] and this man grabbed his family and they
[1:26:43] walked out
[1:26:46] we had a scheduled dinner
[1:26:49] the next day to with this fella
[1:26:53] I'd known him for years
[1:26:57] and he said you know why last night I
[1:26:58] just didn't
[1:27:00] just didn't appreciate what went on
[1:27:03] he said I don't think we as Christians
[1:27:05] ought to have to do that
[1:27:07] he said it grieved my heart
[1:27:10] when I saw people dancing
[1:27:13] you know he had forgot to quote where
[1:27:15] brother Brown said a man came to him and
[1:27:17] said when that sister started shouting
[1:27:19] and praising the Lord he said if six
[1:27:21] heels all over me
[1:27:23] brother's response to that was you
[1:27:25] better not go to heaven you'll freeze to
[1:27:27] death
[1:27:31] I got a hundred quotes that goes with
[1:27:32] that
[1:27:34] and as I was sitting across the table
[1:27:36] from that man brother Homer sitting
[1:27:38] right beside of me and I just leaned
[1:27:41] across to him and I called his name and
[1:27:42] I said
[1:27:43] the reason
[1:27:45] that you have difficulty
[1:27:48] with that
[1:27:50] is on Tuesday
[1:27:52] you were looking at pornography
[1:27:56] and you got it cut off just in time
[1:28:00] before your wife walked into the room
[1:28:05] that's why you had difficulty with our
[1:28:08] Shout
[1:28:14] now those on the internet may have
[1:28:16] difficulty with our Shout
[1:28:19] it's because they're carrying a secret
[1:28:24] [Applause]
[1:28:31] maybe their their church has classes
[1:28:35] to overcome alcoholism
[1:28:38] or classes to overcome pornography
[1:28:42] let me just say this to you there's only
[1:28:44] one kayak class that I believe in
[1:28:48] and that's a prayer meeting
[1:28:52] where you start that prayer out at
[1:28:55] father forgive me
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:00] and then you begin to expose yourself
[1:29:02] before God and you say God I can't live
[1:29:06] as a slave no longer to this sin
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:14] I don't want to Harbor this and hold
[1:29:16] this in my life no longer
[1:29:19] brother on but I was abused as a child
[1:29:22] don't blame this or that
[1:29:24] you don't have to live in that prison
[1:29:26] house no longer
[1:29:28] you're not a slave to that thing anymore
[1:29:31] I'm sorry that you were abused
[1:29:36] and I'd be the first one to put an
[1:29:38] abuser in jail I'd be that first one
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:49] hell will not be hot enough
[1:29:52] for somebody that abuses our children
[1:29:54] [Applause]
[1:30:07] I think they ought to arrest every one
[1:30:09] of these people that go to on these
[1:30:11] websites to try to for child pornography
[1:30:13] I think they ought to put them in prison
[1:30:15] and keep them there
[1:30:17] [Applause]
[1:30:23] thank you
[1:30:27] let me tell you something about

[1:33:10] or Kings or one of those places
[1:33:14] you know it's just five dollars then the
[1:33:17] same devil will tell you don't pay
[1:33:18] tithes
[1:33:20] [Applause]
[1:33:26] I don't know why I'm revisiting that but
[1:33:29] let me let me just share something with
[1:33:31] you we get so tore up
[1:33:34] when our 401k
[1:33:39] all of a sudden starts falling
[1:33:42] we change administrations and all of a
[1:33:44] sudden it's worth 50 of what it was
[1:33:47] worth
[1:33:49] I'll tell you how much is in my 401k I'm
[1:33:52] gonna be really honest today
[1:33:54] 10
[1:33:55] 462 dollars
[1:33:57] I've had it in there
[1:33:59] since I was 36 years old
[1:34:06] I am not banking on my 401k
[1:34:15] it has reached 20 000 before
[1:34:17] it has went back to seven thousand
[1:34:22] and now it resides at ten thousand
[1:34:28] [Laughter]
[1:34:33] I was talked into it by a tax accountant
[1:34:36] to do that to give me a break on my
[1:34:39] taxes
[1:34:40] and when I realized that there was a
[1:34:42] better place to put my money
[1:34:46] okay you've asked for it several of
[1:34:48] you've asked me how do I be successful
[1:34:51] okay it's not putting your money in the
[1:34:55] stock market
[1:35:03] go get me one of those
[1:35:06] Trace
[1:35:13] everybody gets the Jitters when you do
[1:35:15] this but
[1:35:23] no I'm not going to take up another
[1:35:24] [Laughter]
[1:35:26] [Applause]

[1:35:36] so we might as well wash
[1:35:40] brother Ron how do I be successful
[1:35:44] so
[1:35:46] you take 10 percent
[1:35:49] of what you earn
[1:35:51] the first fruits
[1:35:54] which goes back to God
[1:35:56] and God has told you that he's going to
[1:35:58] seal a covenant with you
[1:36:00] he will make your 90 go further than
[1:36:03] your 100.
[1:36:08] now I think they just raised the
[1:36:10] interest rate to four point
[1:36:13] somebody help me
[1:36:15] on your borrowing
[1:36:17] 4.35 or something like that
[1:36:20] and you can get interest now I know you
[1:36:23] can get interest on a CD at 4.5
[1:36:27] because I did check on that the other
[1:36:28] day

[1:36:32] now I got a solid figure nobody call me
[1:36:35] tell me where I got that but
[1:36:39] I'm ever amazed I take your tithes home

[1:36:46] secret I take your ties home
[1:36:49] and we pray over them here
[1:36:51] but I as your pastor or or a type of a
[1:36:55] high priest take your blessings that God
[1:36:58] has blessed you to work with
[1:37:00] and I take them and that's God's money
[1:37:03] it ain't mine
[1:37:05] I don't buy a car on your money
[1:37:08] I didn't build my house on your money
[1:37:14] I I didn't do that
[1:37:19] but I
[1:37:21] take the word of God
[1:37:24] and pronounce a blessing on you
[1:37:32] isn't that right I pronounce a blessing
[1:37:35] on you it's my job to take God's word
[1:37:38] and pronounce a blessing on you now
[1:37:41] here's where God comes in
[1:37:44] and he starts blessing your job he
[1:37:47] starts blessing your home he Sparks
[1:37:49] blessing every Avenue of your life he
[1:37:52] starts blessing your children

[1:38:26] [Applause]
[1:38:34] so sometimes we've got to wash ourself
[1:38:46] as a man came to my father and was going
[1:38:48] to give him a large sum of money
[1:38:50] my dad needed it
[1:38:52] he needed it
[1:38:54] it was eight of us in the church
[1:38:58] eight
[1:39:00] and this man came to give him a large
[1:39:02] sum of money
[1:39:04] and he said Charlie this is what I want
[1:39:06] you to do with it
[1:39:11] my daddy was a real man he was a man
[1:39:14] from his feet to his head
[1:39:22] and they said you keep that money
[1:39:26] you keep that money
[1:39:28] because that money ain't my money it's
[1:39:30] God's money
[1:39:32] and you don't have a rope on your tithes
[1:39:36] [Music]
[1:39:40] you want another story
[1:39:43] brother Homer was down and me and him
[1:39:45] was working on those those doors
[1:39:47] remember those old doors
[1:39:49] those locks were horrible
[1:39:52] and brother Homer was now working on
[1:39:54] those locks
[1:39:55] and he was working
[1:39:57] and a guy walks by him and he said
[1:39:59] brother Homer I want you to pray for me
[1:40:02] that I can go buy myself a new truck
[1:40:05] brother Homer didn't even take a deep
[1:40:08] breath he said you won't be able to
[1:40:10] handle it because you can't pay your own
[1:40:12] paths
[1:40:13] [Applause]
[1:40:25] man bought the truck lost the truck in a
[1:40:27] few months it was gone Peter just paid
[1:40:29] attention to the pastor
[1:40:33] you know the pastor just simply told him
[1:40:35] the truth
[1:40:36] sometimes we want to go to 14 different
[1:40:39] people to get what we want to hear
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:49] if we can't get the right answer from
[1:40:51] brother Ron we'll go to brother Donnie
[1:40:52] or go to brother Tim or go to Jason
[1:40:54] Jackson go to Joe Greene we'll we're
[1:40:56] going to go to somebody that'll finally
[1:40:57] give us the right answer

[1:41:04] [Applause]
[1:41:10] so now I've just exposed to you for you
[1:41:13] young people
[1:41:14] of The Secret of success
[1:41:17] in your financial matters
[1:41:19] you don't have to go to a six weeks
[1:41:22] class
[1:41:23] where there will be a contest at the end
[1:41:25] of it
[1:41:29] I'll make it simple for you a dime
[1:41:32] is tithes on a dollar
[1:41:36] and if you start with a dime
[1:41:39] then when it get turns into ten dollars
[1:41:42] you give a dollar
[1:41:44] and then God watches you Faithfully at
[1:41:47] one dollar and then it's ten dollars and
[1:41:50] then it's a hundred dollars and then
[1:41:51] it's a thousand dollars and then it's
[1:41:54] ten thousand
[1:42:09] ten percent is ten percent
[1:42:16] Andrew you're my partner in all of this
[1:42:19] that's what I've did and practiced all
[1:42:21] my life
[1:42:24] and I give away more than 10 percent of
[1:42:26] my own
[1:42:35] I don't want to go washing that River
[1:42:37] it's nasty
[1:42:40] the last time you guys were there didn't
[1:42:42] that River stink
[1:42:45] if I go to that church people are going
[1:42:47] to make fun
[1:42:49] they're going to get on the internet and
[1:42:50] say it and people shout that's a little
[1:42:52] wow I've got some wild Services hey
[1:42:55] young buck gets up there and sings and
[1:42:57] dances and preaches and now you know man
[1:43:00] they obviously didn't go to school
[1:43:13] let me tell you something about dignity
[1:43:19] I was preaching a convention
[1:43:24] and it was a guy came in his shorts
[1:43:28] his golf polo
[1:43:30] and his funny looking hat
[1:43:33] his wife was a real believer
[1:43:38] so after church and after our meeting
[1:43:40] took place they had a dinner
[1:43:45] guess who I got to sit right across
[1:43:48] the table from
[1:43:52] this man was a top elected government
[1:43:56] official
[1:44:00] top
[1:44:02] he said in the parliaments of his
[1:44:05] government
[1:44:07] but I had what he needed
[1:44:15] I said Across From Him Sister Alyssa
[1:44:19] I didn't know nothing about his
[1:44:21] government
[1:44:22] I didn't know how they operated
[1:44:25] I didn't talk to him about his golf game
[1:44:29] do you know what I talked to him about
[1:44:31] Zacchaeus
[1:44:35] Zacchaeus had a wife that was a believer
[1:44:41] and she talks so much about Jesus until
[1:44:44] he wanted to see what was going on
[1:44:46] that's exactly where he was at
[1:44:50] and I talked to him about how that
[1:44:52] brother Branham said they got over there
[1:44:54] and he couldn't get in the tree so he
[1:44:56] turned Garbage Pail upside down and he
[1:44:58] got up in and it fell down in the
[1:44:59] garbage he got garbage all over him and
[1:45:01] he got up in the tree and the guy kind
[1:45:03] of just looked at me because he never
[1:45:04] heard a sermon like this
[1:45:09] and I told him all about zacchus and
[1:45:11] then Jesus
[1:45:13] under the tree
[1:45:16] he wasn't worried about his profession
[1:45:18] or even his position in life
[1:45:21] he said Zacchaeus I want to have dinner
[1:45:24] with you
[1:45:26] he didn't teach him about third pool
[1:45:29] he didn't teach him about he was God
[1:45:32] he went to his house and his atmosphere
[1:45:37] change zacchus's life and zacchus went
[1:45:41] and
[1:45:42] redistributed all that he had taken he
[1:45:46] became a different man after he met
[1:45:47] Jesus
[1:45:48] that's what happened at that table
[1:45:53] if I can look past your dignity
[1:45:57] and all you're put on and tell you that
[1:46:01] you need Jesus
[1:46:03] [Applause]
[1:46:05] and if you can get past from your side
[1:46:08] all of your put on and all your dignity
[1:46:11] and all your honor and I'm all this and
[1:46:14] you can realize you're rotten flesh
[1:46:16] stinks
[1:46:26] brother berms says you we said those
[1:46:29] little girls going down the street he
[1:46:31] said within 24 hours worms could be
[1:46:33] crawling through her body
[1:46:38] so that Purdy flesh actually stinks
[1:46:48] Naaman
[1:46:51] finally come to the place
[1:46:55] I can't live with this no more but if
[1:46:57] this is the answer
[1:47:01] and he started pulling off his and now
[1:47:03] what he had talked about everybody saw
[1:47:06] it
[1:47:07] brother Timothy now all of the men that
[1:47:10] had served him
[1:47:12] looked at his rotten flesh
[1:47:15] they'd never seen it before
[1:47:19] now they could smell it
[1:47:23] and now he was just taking it off
[1:47:28] and he waited out in that muddy
[1:47:31] stinking
[1:47:33] River
[1:47:39] and he dipped once
[1:47:41] and it was still there
[1:47:44] he dipped again
[1:47:46] and it was still there you may have to
[1:47:48] go to the altar more than one time
[1:47:51] but you got to fight it out
[1:47:54] either sin or reign in your life or
[1:47:56] you're going to fight it out in the
[1:47:57] champion of our life will come and live
[1:48:00] God don't live in a halfway house
[1:48:03] [Music]
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:06] sin and the sin and God don't live
[1:48:09] together
[1:48:10] Sims Gotta Die
[1:48:13] and brother Chris he dipped seven times
[1:48:18] and on his seventh time up
[1:48:21] one of Elijah's Miracles one of the
[1:48:24] double portions happened in a moment's
[1:48:27] notice
[1:48:31] it was over
[1:48:33] his nightmare was over
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:42] you talking about shouting
[1:48:45] you talk about shouting
[1:48:48] I don't give you a bad illusion but I
[1:48:50] would imagine there was a naked Naaman
[1:48:54] that had the best looking skin that was
[1:48:56] in the land dancing all up and down that
[1:48:59] Jordan
[1:49:01] I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm
[1:49:05] Healed I'm Healed I'm not dying no more
[1:49:07] I'm not rotten no more I'm not stinking
[1:49:10] no more that's what we need here there's
[1:49:13] some people to start just shouting and
[1:49:16] running up and down your experience
[1:49:18] it's all about
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:41] just as Jesus had men to come back to
[1:49:45] thank him
[1:49:47] for what he had done
[1:49:49] Naaman went back to Elisha
[1:49:52] this time Elisha came out
[1:49:56] I want you to just notice this time
[1:49:58] Elisha came out
[1:50:03] and he wanted to thank him
[1:50:05] he wanted to thank him in so much he
[1:50:07] wanted to give all the gifts and give it
[1:50:10] to him
[1:50:12] no doubt Elisha
[1:50:14] lived in one of the smallest houses that
[1:50:17] there was
[1:50:19] you'd have never picked that as a
[1:50:21] prophet's house
[1:50:26] he wanted to give him all those gifts
[1:50:31] I don't want you I don't want to
[1:50:33] I don't want it
[1:50:38] you can't buy miracles
[1:50:41] you can't buy your salvation
[1:50:44] I talked to you about ties but you can't
[1:50:46] just because you pay tiers you still got
[1:50:48] to be born again
[1:50:52] you got to be born again you can't
[1:50:53] bypass that
[1:50:55] you got to go to the muddy Jordan
[1:50:56] yourself
[1:50:57] you can't send a friend to do it for you
[1:50:59] you can't send a pastor to do it for you
[1:51:01] you got to do it yourself
[1:51:03] you got to do it
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:11] but what would you want from me
[1:51:15] he said I want I want some barrels
[1:51:19] of dirt
[1:51:23] our dirt yeah
[1:51:26] I've got to go back home
[1:51:29] but your God don't live at my house
[1:51:34] the blessings are here
[1:51:36] so I want to take your God that has
[1:51:40] healed me to my house
[1:51:44] this a preach
[1:51:46] there's a preach right here what lives
[1:51:49] in this building God wants to go to your
[1:51:52] house
[1:51:53] you say my brother Ryan I live in an
[1:51:56] impossible situation have I not told you
[1:51:59] before that all things are possible to
[1:52:03] them that believe
[1:52:08] my wife will never serve God are you are
[1:52:11] you are you putting breaks on God my
[1:52:15] husband will never serve God
[1:52:17] [Applause]
[1:52:26] sorry
[1:52:33] a sister was going to brother branham's
[1:52:36] meetings and she was telling her husband
[1:52:39] when the brother Brandon says the angel
[1:52:41] is here I can see it
[1:52:45] when he says the pillar fire is right
[1:52:47] over there she said I can see it I'm
[1:52:49] nobody spiritual but I can see it
[1:52:58] and she tells him a couple of nights and
[1:53:01] finally he says I'm gonna go
[1:53:03] foreign
[1:53:04] and so he goes
[1:53:07] now God's got a sense of humor
[1:53:10] he's got a way
[1:53:14] don't you try to fix it God's Got a Way
[1:53:19] they ask that man
[1:53:23] to Usher brother Brian from the car
[1:53:27] to the pulpit
[1:53:32] a lot of guys watching brother Brown's
[1:53:33] Buddies
[1:53:34] but God had it that this critic
[1:53:38] would be the Usher
[1:53:41] for brother Branham
[1:53:43] to go to the pulpit
[1:53:46] and he's standing there with a lot of
[1:53:47] thoughts in his mind of what brother
[1:53:48] random would be like
[1:53:50] and he said when brother Branham got out
[1:53:52] of the car he said he stood there and
[1:53:54] talked to him like he had known him all
[1:53:56] of his life
[1:54:01] and said they talked his people was kind
[1:54:03] of pushing their way and said brother
[1:54:04] Brandon just talked to him
[1:54:06] you know they was going toward the door
[1:54:10] and he said when brother Brown got to
[1:54:12] the door he pulled his hat off and he
[1:54:13] said
[1:54:14] would you mind holding my hat
[1:54:18] while I preach
[1:54:22] and he said I stood there
[1:54:25] and I'm being a Critic are now in the
[1:54:28] position of holding his hat
[1:54:31] while he preached
[1:54:34] do you know before the service was over
[1:54:37] that man was a believer
[1:54:43] how do you know that sir that story so
[1:54:45] well that man
[1:54:47] came to this church
[1:54:49] down on the
[1:54:51] the drive what was
[1:54:54] Summit
[1:54:55] many times
[1:54:57] and told us that story several times
[1:55:02] and he said what clinched the nail he
[1:55:04] said
[1:55:05] there was a lady come across the prayer
[1:55:07] line that
[1:55:08] and brother random told her her name and
[1:55:10] he said that was right
[1:55:12] and he and he told her her address
[1:55:15] and he said
[1:55:17] nope that ain't right
[1:55:19] so he put himself in position when she
[1:55:22] came off of the platform he told you
[1:55:24] your name and that was right but then he
[1:55:27] told you your address and that wasn't
[1:55:28] right she said we moved yesterday
[1:55:32] [Applause]
[1:55:42] so maybe you need to get a big bucket
[1:55:45] today

[1:56:17] Licious God he was those people's God
[1:56:20] but he's my God now

[1:57:13] we may not have preached to you a great
[1:57:14] Revelation today

[1:57:19] presenting Jesus Christ
