[58:54] a discerner of the thoughts and the
[58:56] intents of the heart I still believe

[59:01] word I believe that it was in Acts 10
[59:03] and 44 that while Peter yet spake these
[59:05] words that the Holy Ghost fell I pray
[59:08] tonight let it be said over in 2023 that

[59:14] Holy Ghost fell Lord I pray God that you
[59:17] come and look up our our sacrifice that
[59:19] is upon the altar may you come Lord and
[59:22] take the tongs and take the cold off of
[59:25] The Altar and place it upon our lips
[59:27] Lord Jesus that we could offer unto you
[59:30] a sacrifice that is due to your name
[59:33] with so love and appreciate you tonight
[59:35] ask God he administer to us help us do a
[59:38] good job and get out of the way just now
[59:39] both speaker and hearer Lord we love and
[59:43] appreciate you in the name of the Lord
[59:45] Jesus Christ
[59:47] if you have your Bibles this evening
[59:49] would like to look over you in the in
[59:52] the Old Testament they are into Malachi
[59:54] chapter 4 and verses 5 and 6 and then
[59:58] also down to First Kings
[1:00:00] First Kings chapter 18 and verse 17.
[1:00:07] man Malachi chapter 4
[1:00:10] then First Kings chapter 18. just want
[1:00:13] to make mention that we we really
[1:00:15] enjoyed having the the youth testimony
[1:00:17] last last Sunday night and there were
[1:00:20] some others that were able to come and
[1:00:22] be a part of that and share even their
[1:00:24] testimonies and we had a three-hour
[1:00:26] testimony service there and that Lord
[1:00:29] really got behind it and we've seen some
[1:00:31] very Dynamic and Powerful things amongst
[1:00:33] our young people and we're just we're
[1:00:35] just very thankful for what the Lord is
[1:00:37] doing and and we just appreciate him
[1:00:40] amen Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 and I
[1:00:43] know it's very familiar to you but we
[1:00:45] want to read these things and this is
[1:00:46] this is where we want to gather our
[1:00:48] thought from tonight Malachi chapter 4
[1:00:50] and behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:00:54] prophet
[1:00:55] notice there's three people
[1:00:57] automatically right there I the Lord
[1:00:59] will send you Elijah prophet and we
[1:01:02] believe that William Branham fulfilled
[1:01:04] this portion of scripture
[1:01:07] before the coming of the great and
[1:01:08] Dreadful day of the Lord and notice and
[1:01:11] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:01:13] to the children and the Heart of the
[1:01:16] children to their fathers lest I come
[1:01:18] and smite the Earth with a curse notice
[1:01:21] every single time that a child is born
[1:01:23] it carries the nature of its father
[1:01:26] so notice there is power in the Turning
[1:01:29] there's very much very much power in the
[1:01:32] Turning of the heart first king chapter
[1:01:34] 18 and verse 17 and it's very lengthy
[1:01:37] lengthy reading here tonight but I trust
[1:01:40] it'll be okay with you tonight and it
[1:01:43] came to pass that when an Ahab saw
[1:01:45] Elijah that Ahab said unto him art thou
[1:01:48] he that troubleth Israel and he answered
[1:01:51] I have not troubled Israel but thou and
[1:01:54] thy father's house in that you have
[1:01:56] forsaken the Commandments of the Lord
[1:01:57] and thou has followed Balaam and then
[1:02:00] amazing that the backslider is called or
[1:02:03] calling out to Israel or to Elijah and
[1:02:05] saying are you the one that troubling
[1:02:07] Israel
[1:02:08] but here was the one that was troubling
[1:02:10] these things it was thyself and thy
[1:02:13] father's house in that you have forsaken
[1:02:16] the Commandments of the Lord and thou
[1:02:17] has followed Balaam now therefore sin
[1:02:20] and gather to me all of Israel unto
[1:02:22] Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal
[1:02:24] 450 and the prophets of the Grove 400
[1:02:27] which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab was
[1:02:30] sent unto the children of Israel and
[1:02:32] gathered the prophets together under
[1:02:33] Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto all
[1:02:37] the people and said how long halt ye
[1:02:39] between two opinions if the Lord be God
[1:02:41] follow him but if Baal then follow him
[1:02:43] and then people and the people answered
[1:02:46] him not a word then Elijah unsaid unto a
[1:02:51] light then said Elijah unto the people I
[1:02:53] even I only remain a prophet of the Lord
[1:02:55] but baal's prophets are 450 men and the
[1:02:59] best of men at the end of this are just
[1:03:01] men but this is a prophet unto the Lord
[1:03:03] let them therefore give us two Bullocks
[1:03:06] and let them choose one bullet look from
[1:03:09] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[1:03:11] it on the wood and put no fire under it
[1:03:13] and I will dress the other bullet and
[1:03:15] lay it on the wood and put no fire under
[1:03:17] it and call ye upon the name of your
[1:03:20] gods and I will call on the name of the
[1:03:23] Lord and the god that answers by fire
[1:03:25] let him be God and all the people
[1:03:28] answered and said it is well spoken and
[1:03:30] Elijah said unto the prophets of bell
[1:03:32] choose you one bullet for yourselves and
[1:03:35] dress it first for you are many and call
[1:03:37] upon the name of your Gods but put no
[1:03:39] fire under it and they took the Bullock
[1:03:42] which was given them and dressed it and
[1:03:44] called upon the name of Bell from
[1:03:46] mourning even until noon saying oh Baal
[1:03:49] hear us but there was no voice nor any
[1:03:52] that answered and they leaped upon the
[1:03:54] altar which was made and it came to pass
[1:03:57] at noon that Elijah mocked them and said
[1:04:00] cry aloud for he is a God either he is
[1:04:02] talking or he is pursuing or he's in a
[1:04:05] journey poor poor Adventure he sleepeth
[1:04:07] and must be aware awaken now notice I
[1:04:10] want you to I want to just draw your
[1:04:12] attention just for a second I know I've
[1:04:14] got you standing but I want you to draw
[1:04:15] your attention notice these these
[1:04:18] actions that these Baal worshipers are
[1:04:20] in notice it looks a lot like a what
[1:04:22] what we would call as some called
[1:04:24] Pentecostal there's a lot of shouting
[1:04:27] there's a lot of dancing there's a lot
[1:04:29] of screaming there if you'll notice they
[1:04:31] prophesied all day long
[1:04:34] this is an all-day event
[1:04:36] and it came to pass that at noon that
[1:04:38] Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud
[1:04:40] for he is God either he's talking or he
[1:04:43] said cry aloud for he said God either
[1:04:44] he's talking or he's pursuing or he's in
[1:04:46] a journey or pure Adventure he's
[1:04:48] sleepeth and must be awake and they
[1:04:49] cried aloud and cut themselves after the
[1:04:51] manner with knives and Lancing still the
[1:04:53] blood gusts out upon them and it came to
[1:04:56] pass that when midday was passed and
[1:04:58] they prophesied into the time of the
[1:05:00] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:05:03] there was neither voice nor any to
[1:05:04] answer nor any that regarded and Elijah
[1:05:07] said unto all the people come near unto
[1:05:10] me and the people came near unto him and
[1:05:13] he repaired the altar of the Lord that
[1:05:16] was broken down may God bless his word
[1:05:19] he may be seated here in the presence of
[1:05:21] the Lord
[1:05:22] and I'm going to continue on continue on
[1:05:25] but I didn't want to leave you standing
[1:05:26] notice that last verse in Elijah verse
[1:05:29] 30 and Elijah said unto all the people
[1:05:30] come near unto me and all the people
[1:05:33] came near unto him and he repaired the
[1:05:34] altar of the Lord that was broken down
[1:05:36] and Elijah took 12 Stones according to
[1:05:39] the number of the tribes of the sons of
[1:05:41] Jacob unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:05:43] came saying Israel shall be thy name and
[1:05:47] with the stones he built an altar in the
[1:05:49] name of the Lord and he made a trench
[1:05:50] about the altar as great as would
[1:05:52] contain two measures of seed and he put
[1:05:54] the wood in order and cut bollocks and
[1:05:57] pieces and laid him on the wood and said
[1:05:59] fill four barrels of water and pour it
[1:06:01] on the board's sacrifice on the wood and
[1:06:04] he said do it a second time and they did
[1:06:07] it a second time and he said do it the
[1:06:09] third time and they did it the third
[1:06:10] time now I want to do all this to your
[1:06:12] attention there ain't been rain for
[1:06:14] three and a half years where's Elijah
[1:06:15] getting this water out
[1:06:18] and the water ran around about the
[1:06:20] Walter and he filled the trench also
[1:06:22] with alter and it came to pass at the
[1:06:24] time of the offering notice of the
[1:06:26] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[1:06:28] prophet came near and said Lord God of
[1:06:31] Abraham Isaac and of Jacob let it be
[1:06:33] known this day that thou art God and
[1:06:35] Israel and and that I am thy servant and
[1:06:38] that I have done all of these things at
[1:06:41] Thy word Hear Me O Lord hear me that
[1:06:43] this people may know that thou art the
[1:06:45] Lord God and thou has turned their heart
[1:06:47] back again there is power in the Turning
[1:06:50] thou has turned our heart back again
[1:06:53] then the fire of the Lord fell and
[1:06:55] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:06:57] wood and the stones and the dust licked
[1:06:59] up the water that was in the trench and
[1:07:02] when all the people saw it they fell on
[1:07:04] their faces and said the Lord he is the
[1:07:07] god the Lord he is the God by these
[1:07:11] scripture readings tonight I would like
[1:07:12] to speak to you on a thought that the
[1:07:14] Lord has placed on our heart on
[1:07:16] worshiping from a restored alter
[1:07:19] worshiping from a restored Altar and we
[1:07:22] recognize that here at this church that
[1:07:24] we recognize the very the very
[1:07:26] sacredness of the altar it's a very
[1:07:29] special spot and I believe that I
[1:07:31] believe that there there's a lot of
[1:07:32] people that want to do away with altars
[1:07:34] but we believe in an altar and we know
[1:07:37] that the altar is a place of prayer it's
[1:07:39] a place of worship it's a place where
[1:07:42] men bow down and I thought the song that
[1:07:44] India is saying was fitting that they
[1:07:45] kneel down people kneel down and begin
[1:07:47] to talk to almighty God and lay out
[1:07:49] their petitions before almighty God
[1:07:51] because and they they recognize that
[1:07:54] there is a faithful God that still
[1:07:56] answers you see the altar was not made
[1:07:59] for flowers but the altar was made for
[1:08:02] man and there and I'll just say that
[1:08:04] there there there is a lot of things and
[1:08:06] let me preface this service tonight and
[1:08:08] saying this that I still believe in
[1:08:10] altar cause and I still believe that God
[1:08:12] still finds you here at an altar and I
[1:08:15] know that there are some things and it's
[1:08:17] wonderful when you can have somebody
[1:08:19] that can come and be your friend or
[1:08:21] somebody can lay your hands upon you or
[1:08:23] their hands upon you and pray over you
[1:08:25] but there are certain things that just
[1:08:27] cannot be done like it's done at an
[1:08:29] altar and I believe that there are some
[1:08:31] things that you just you know there's a
[1:08:33] lot of things that I can pray over you
[1:08:35] and I know it's encouraging when a man
[1:08:37] of God comes and he begins to speak a
[1:08:38] word of encouragement over your life
[1:08:40] those are a lot of those who do you
[1:08:42] great things but in the midst of your
[1:08:44] trials there are great things that are
[1:08:46] garnered from the time that you spent at
[1:08:49] the altar call where you are setting
[1:08:51] there and you were praying to almighty
[1:08:53] God now William Branham you'll find that
[1:08:55] sometimes that brother Brandon would say
[1:08:56] that he didn't believe in altar calls it
[1:08:58] wasn't that he didn't believe in altar
[1:09:00] calls he didn't believe in the way that
[1:09:01] men were operating in those altar calls
[1:09:03] and they were trying to push people and
[1:09:06] call people and beat them when they got
[1:09:07] them down there they'd be try to beat
[1:09:09] the Holy Ghost into them but that's not
[1:09:11] how you get the Holy Ghost into anybody
[1:09:13] but there's a lot of people that want to
[1:09:15] do away with an altar but I'm a Believer
[1:09:17] in an altar night because there's
[1:09:19] something sacred about bowing on your
[1:09:21] knees and worshiping almighty God and
[1:09:24] recognizing that God's not wanting
[1:09:26] flowers on the altar God is wanting you
[1:09:29] upon the Altar and there's a lot of
[1:09:31] times that brother random would say he
[1:09:32] said what's wrong with America today is
[1:09:34] that they took the altar out of the
[1:09:36] church and they put it down in the
[1:09:37] basement he said in the only he said the
[1:09:39] biggest problem of is that is that the
[1:09:41] only fire that they got left in the
[1:09:43] house of the god is down there in the
[1:09:44] basement he said what we need is an
[1:09:47] old-fashioned Holy Ghost Pentecost and
[1:09:49] Upper Room experience where God can pour
[1:09:51] out the Holy Spirit
[1:09:53] you see an altar it isn't necessarily
[1:09:55] necessarily made out of one certain
[1:09:57] material but you go throughout the Bible
[1:09:59] and I just want to lay some things out
[1:10:01] here tonight that that when you go to
[1:10:03] studying out the the word altar
[1:10:05] throughout the Bible that it's mentioned
[1:10:07] over 321 times throughout the Bible and
[1:10:10] an altar could be made out of certain
[1:10:12] different materials or different things
[1:10:13] it was a place it could be made out of
[1:10:16] the table or it could be made out of
[1:10:17] wood or it could be made out of huge
[1:10:19] stone or stones and many times you'll
[1:10:21] find that in the Bible that that men
[1:10:23] took Earth or turf and they built an
[1:10:25] altar there and you'll find that in the
[1:10:28] Bible that it was a place of which
[1:10:30] offerings were made unto almighty God
[1:10:33] and there's a lot of people that don't
[1:10:35] they they don't believe in altars
[1:10:36] anymore but it is the point that I want
[1:10:38] to bring out to you tonight that if we
[1:10:40] shouldn't have altars in the Church of
[1:10:42] God then why is Satan imitating by a
[1:10:45] heathen worship my false gods that they
[1:10:48] bring up their altars and they sacrifice
[1:10:50] under their Heathen Gods so we recognize
[1:10:53] said there's real power in an altar so
[1:10:56] we recognize that an altar was a place
[1:10:58] where a sacrifice had to be made out
[1:11:01] you'll find that the very first time
[1:11:03] that you read in the Bible the word
[1:11:05] altar was when Noah had come out of the
[1:11:07] Ark when he'd been up there all of them
[1:11:09] days been up there waiting for the water
[1:11:11] to dissipate away from the ark that they
[1:11:14] are that Noah began to worship God and
[1:11:16] he began to clean and bring a burnt
[1:11:19] offering of every clean beast and every
[1:11:21] clean foul unto the Lord God Almighty
[1:11:23] you'll find that Abraham and Isaac
[1:11:25] believed and they built altars through
[1:11:27] the Lord and they would have constructed
[1:11:29] many times they would construct them out
[1:11:31] of the Earth or they would construct
[1:11:32] them out of stones and at times it
[1:11:35] simply said in the Bible that they built
[1:11:37] an altar unto the Lord and at other
[1:11:39] times they built an altar and then they
[1:11:41] called upon the name of the Lord he the
[1:11:42] way an altar is a spot of worship you
[1:11:46] see an altar would be appeared in many
[1:11:49] times resurrected of drawing near to
[1:11:51] almighty God of which sacrifice is the
[1:11:55] basis there it's a wonderful thing to
[1:11:57] have an altar but the thing about an
[1:11:59] altar is its calling for a sacrifice
[1:12:02] is that right there's a lot of things
[1:12:04] that are in there that are laying there
[1:12:06] on an altar but the thing that God is
[1:12:08] wanting on the altar is a sacrifice so
[1:12:11] what God is saying is that that I don't
[1:12:13] just want an altar but I'm wanting
[1:12:15] worship I want to sacrifice because if
[1:12:18] an altar is all that it takes then Cain
[1:12:20] was justified in having an altar call is
[1:12:23] that right and Abel he they both do the
[1:12:26] same thing they both wanted to worship
[1:12:27] God but you see God requires more than
[1:12:31] just an altar because Cain built an
[1:12:33] altar on the almighty God but God wanted
[1:12:35] more than what Cain was putting upon the
[1:12:37] altar but Abel caught a hold of a
[1:12:39] revelation that what God wanted upon the
[1:12:42] altar was not the fruit of the land or
[1:12:44] the flowers of the land but he wanted a
[1:12:46] sacrifice and Abel caught a revelation
[1:12:49] that it was blood that brought them out
[1:12:51] of Eden and it was blood that would take
[1:12:53] them back into Eden so Abel caught a
[1:12:55] revelation but here is Cain here is Cain
[1:12:58] and he's worshiped this is true worship
[1:13:00] this is true worship he's got an altar
[1:13:02] he's got a sacrifice upon the altar but
[1:13:05] the thing was Cain was not willing to go
[1:13:07] where Abel was willing to go you see
[1:13:09] because if you'll study out in the Bible
[1:13:10] is that Abel died on the same altar that
[1:13:14] is sacrifice died upon Him Cain came the
[1:13:16] same exact way but yet God didn't he
[1:13:20] didn't come God's provided way
[1:13:22] he said right he didn't come God's
[1:13:24] provided way and I want you to know that
[1:13:26] God will never take what you don't put
[1:13:28] on the altar
[1:13:30] God will not take what you do not put on
[1:13:33] the altar if you want your life to be
[1:13:35] blessed place it upon the altar if you
[1:13:37] want your family to be blessed place it
[1:13:39] upon the altar if you want your business
[1:13:41] if you want all of these things place it
[1:13:43] upon the altar you see him many times
[1:13:45] people say well I don't see God working
[1:13:47] in this area of my life have you really
[1:13:49] sacrificed that to almighty God
[1:13:52] is that right you've got to tap into a
[1:13:55] channel where Abel tapped into a channel
[1:13:57] and the Bible said that by faith Abel
[1:13:59] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:14:01] sacrifice than that of Cain because you
[1:14:04] see God had obtained he'd obtained a
[1:14:06] witness from almighty God
[1:14:11] Hallelujah now notice what brother Madam
[1:14:13] said in a very powerful message on you
[1:14:15] must be born again he said now the
[1:14:16] approach to this birth he said there is
[1:14:19] an approach and he said the approach to
[1:14:21] this birth he said you've got to go
[1:14:22] through a process he said just like
[1:14:24] anything that lives anything that lives
[1:14:27] has got to go and die first he said you
[1:14:29] cannot keep your sane Spirit you cannot
[1:14:31] keep your same habits you cannot keep
[1:14:33] your same old thoughts you've got to die
[1:14:36] you've got to die like Abel died you've
[1:14:38] got to die on The Altar like Abel died
[1:14:40] with his lamb you've got to die with
[1:14:43] your lamp now who's your lamb
[1:14:46] it's our Lord Jesus Christ he said
[1:14:48] you've got to die you've got to die to
[1:14:50] your own thinking to be born to his
[1:14:52] thinking he said let the mind that was
[1:14:54] in Christ be in you he said you've got
[1:14:56] to think his thoughts so you cannot
[1:14:59] think your thoughts but you've got to
[1:15:01] think Almighty God's thoughts because
[1:15:03] you see if all you've got is
[1:15:05] intellectual thoughts are your faults
[1:15:07] then it's going to get you into trouble
[1:15:08] and intellectual thoughts or
[1:15:10] intellectual religion will always fail
[1:15:13] you intellectual faith will let you down
[1:15:15] but I want you to recognize that God
[1:15:17] will never let you down you see there's
[1:15:19] always two seeds he was Cain and Abel he
[1:15:22] was Esau and Jacob he was Jesus Jesus
[1:15:25] and Judas it's Christ and the Antichrist
[1:15:28] so it's always two seeds there's an
[1:15:30] intellectual faith and then there's a
[1:15:32] real genuine faith that is born by a new
[1:15:35] birth under the holy ghost that gives
[1:15:37] you a true genuine faith that doesn't
[1:15:40] waver and it doesn't move off of it but
[1:15:43] you see intellectual faith will let you
[1:15:45] down how do I know it let you down it's
[1:15:47] because I tried it before and it always
[1:15:49] let me down but whenever I got into a
[1:15:52] source
[1:15:53] whenever I got into a source of faith it
[1:15:55] never let me down I tell you what an
[1:15:57] intellectual faith is it's like going
[1:15:58] down and buying something from a Dollar
[1:16:00] Tree for a dollar you know that you only
[1:16:03] bought it for a purpose that it's going
[1:16:04] to last you for so long because if you
[1:16:06] go down there and you buy a shovel at
[1:16:08] the Dollar Tree it's only going to last
[1:16:10] you maybe through half a job
[1:16:12] it's like you going down there and
[1:16:14] trying to buy somebody buy a car or buy
[1:16:16] furniture down there to Dollar Tree it's
[1:16:18] going to let you down when Thanksgiving
[1:16:20] rolls around and you're sitting on the
[1:16:22] Dollar Tree Furniture it's going to let
[1:16:23] you down and if you're setting upon an
[1:16:26] intellectual faith that intellectual
[1:16:27] faith is going to let you down but if
[1:16:29] you got a real genuine Faith like
[1:16:31] Abraham had Faith then it'll never let
[1:16:33] you down well there's a lot of people
[1:16:35] say well brother Andrew how do you know
[1:16:37] how do you know if you got an
[1:16:38] intellectual Faith or if you've got
[1:16:40] genuine Faith you test it out just like
[1:16:42] Abraham tested out his faith when he
[1:16:45] laid Abraham when he laid his son Isaac
[1:16:47] that he waited for 25 years and now he's
[1:16:49] in the age scrap age gap of 12 to 15
[1:16:52] years old and God's asking him to lay
[1:16:54] his Isaac down upon the Altar and you
[1:16:57] find out whether you got real Faith or
[1:16:59] intellectual Faith right here because
[1:17:01] God God is going to test you out and see
[1:17:03] if you've got real Faith here or not so
[1:17:05] he takes Abraham upon a mountain of
[1:17:07] Mount Moriah and he asked him to lay
[1:17:09] Isaac down upon the altar but Jehovah
[1:17:12] was so to him that I am almighty God
[1:17:15] you see me at the intellectual brother
[1:17:17] made him said in a message on Abraham's
[1:17:19] Covenant he said you see he said but
[1:17:21] don't both of those faiths was trying to
[1:17:23] go at work he said in a fairly
[1:17:25] intellectual Faith was trying to work
[1:17:27] there and he said now what is Sarah
[1:17:29] going to say when you get back home and
[1:17:31] you sacrifice to Isaac
[1:17:33] he said my dad he said on the other side
[1:17:36] he said there was a little buzzer on the
[1:17:38] inside of Abraham that was saying that I
[1:17:41] am Jehovah I can provide if he can make
[1:17:45] me a young man when I was an old man
[1:17:47] without hope without anything in my body
[1:17:49] without strength in my lungs where I
[1:17:52] couldn't produce anything if he can
[1:17:54] produce that in me he can produce an
[1:17:56] Isaac again
[1:17:58] what was he showing is that Isaac was
[1:18:01] showing that he was as obedient as his
[1:18:04] father was obedient let me tell you
[1:18:06] young people Isaac will show you a real
[1:18:09] type of genuine Faith he didn't get down
[1:18:11] there and say hey I'm too young to be
[1:18:13] religious he didn't get down there and
[1:18:14] say well I've still got some more times
[1:18:16] where I got to go out and listen to rock
[1:18:18] and roll music but it was simply
[1:18:20] obedient to the call to make a sacrifice
[1:18:24] hallelujah hallelujah you see he was
[1:18:27] willing to put him on the altar because
[1:18:29] he knew Jehovah would back him up
[1:18:32] now notice that when Moses goes in there
[1:18:36] and he lays out the Tabernacle of the
[1:18:38] congregation notice that if you go to
[1:18:40] studying out in Exodus 40 and 29 that he
[1:18:43] put the altar of burnt offering by the
[1:18:46] door of the Tabernacle so it's important
[1:18:49] what you see when you enter into the
[1:18:51] house of the Lord well let me put it in
[1:18:53] in this way it's important what God sees
[1:18:56] when he enters into the house of the
[1:18:58] Lord God don't want to see a bunch of
[1:19:00] mimicking people or people trying to
[1:19:02] imitate he wants to see a real altar
[1:19:07] I'm gonna go ahead and drop it to you
[1:19:09] God ain't necessarily wondering about
[1:19:11] this altar he wants this altar
[1:19:14] he wants this altar you see now the
[1:19:17] Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the
[1:19:21] door so if we're going to come to
[1:19:22] worship then we've got to gain access
[1:19:24] through the door and we know that when
[1:19:27] you see a man and he's sitting there and
[1:19:29] he's knocking on the door what is he
[1:19:31] trying to do he's trying to gain
[1:19:32] entrance because God or somebody is
[1:19:35] wanting to come in that's the reason why
[1:19:38] he's knocking now brother Brandon
[1:19:40] preaches a very powerful and a very key
[1:19:43] message if you haven't listened to it in
[1:19:45] a while go and listen to a key to the
[1:19:47] north but brother random is laying out
[1:19:49] some real fundamental things to the key
[1:19:51] to our hearts and the key to the door
[1:19:52] and he tells us about different rooms in
[1:19:55] there but he goes in there he lays some
[1:19:57] things out I think these things are
[1:19:59] wonderful that brother random said he
[1:20:01] said now if a man is trying to
[1:20:02] accumulate knowledge what does he do he
[1:20:05] goes down to a place where he can get
[1:20:07] some books or he goes down there where
[1:20:08] he can get some learning so he goes down
[1:20:10] there so he can get some teaching and
[1:20:12] when he gets down there and he sits
[1:20:13] under that for a while he begins to
[1:20:15] accumulate what he went in there for he
[1:20:18] had the key what was it there was a
[1:20:20] teacher back there that opened up a book
[1:20:22] I remember there were some teachers that
[1:20:24] I absolutely hated
[1:20:26] but there were some teachers that I
[1:20:28] absolutely loved they knew how to make
[1:20:30] reading fund they knew how to make math
[1:20:32] fun and all of those things what was it
[1:20:35] they had the ability to turn the key and
[1:20:37] I think it's a wonderful thing that we
[1:20:38] have god-given teachers in this hour
[1:20:41] that have the ability to unlock a key
[1:20:43] not just for the knowledge but to show a
[1:20:45] real example and exemplify the very
[1:20:48] power of the message but notice he said
[1:20:50] he said what he was he said what he was
[1:20:52] doing he was down there accumulating
[1:20:54] what he went in there for he said it's
[1:20:57] like a person that wants to go into a
[1:20:58] place and they're wanting to learn piano
[1:21:00] or they're wanting to learn a certain
[1:21:02] instrument he said you what they do he
[1:21:04] said they go to a place and they try to
[1:21:06] get some lessons maybe they'll go down
[1:21:08] there and try to get some lessons for a
[1:21:10] long time and they never catch the key
[1:21:12] or the mystery of it because it was
[1:21:15] never unlocked to them I had sister
[1:21:17] Cassie try to teach me how to play piano
[1:21:19] many many years ago and I found out real
[1:21:21] quick that I didn't have the key to it
[1:21:23] because I was all thumbs and I never
[1:21:26] could make them cooperate but you see
[1:21:28] there was something that I couldn't
[1:21:30] unlock but yet she tapped into a channel
[1:21:32] because there was something on the
[1:21:34] inside of her that told her to
[1:21:37] accumulate these things
[1:21:38] because God wasn't just giving her a key
[1:21:41] to open it up for that world he was
[1:21:43] giving her a key to open it up for this
[1:21:45] world so that she could worship
[1:21:49] from a door that had been unlocked
[1:21:52] now let me say something you didn't come
[1:21:54] here this weekend just to accumulate
[1:21:56] some knowledge or to accumulate well I
[1:21:59] went to church again this weekend you
[1:22:01] come here to accumulate some real Faith
[1:22:03] to accumulate some real Revelations
[1:22:05] where you could come here and say I got
[1:22:07] what just what I came for from the Lord
[1:22:09] I come in here expecting and the
[1:22:12] preacher turned the key to the door I
[1:22:15] tell you what it was Peter locked that
[1:22:17] door open the key on the day of
[1:22:19] Pentecost and the doors wide open for
[1:22:21] you tonight if you want revelation the
[1:22:24] doors wide open for you tonight if you
[1:22:26] want the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:22:28] door is wide open for you tonight
[1:22:30] you see what you come for is to
[1:22:33] accumulate something from the heavenlies
[1:22:35] that's why the message is so important
[1:22:38] in this hour is because the message
[1:22:40] didn't come and be form us it came and
[1:22:42] transformed us
[1:22:44] and that's the problem with religion of
[1:22:46] the day we want as many people as we can
[1:22:48] get in there that's what the churches
[1:22:50] want they look at numbers but we're not
[1:22:52] looking at numbers we're looking at the
[1:22:54] altar we're looking at the people
[1:22:57] let me tell you this this altar right
[1:23:00] here is no good unless you're here
[1:23:04] church building is no good without you
[1:23:06] here this microphone is no good without
[1:23:09] somebody operating behind it
[1:23:12] but if there's somebody that's got faith
[1:23:14] enough to turn the key
[1:23:17] hallelujah what is it God's wanting an
[1:23:20] altar and you cannot build an altar upon
[1:23:23] your past
[1:23:25] that's a problem with so many people
[1:23:27] today they try to build and alter upon
[1:23:29] their past but God's not asking for you
[1:23:32] to be reformed God's asking you to be
[1:23:36] transformed that's why Paul would say in
[1:23:38] Romans chapter 12 and 2 to that that to
[1:23:41] be not just changed in your mind not to
[1:23:44] be conformed to the world but to be
[1:23:46] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:23:50] you see you cannot build an altar upon
[1:23:53] past Church relationships or past church
[1:23:57] reputations but you've got to build your
[1:24:00] altar upon thus saith the Lord if you're
[1:24:04] building your altar if you're building
[1:24:05] your sacrifice upon your failures or
[1:24:08] somebody else's failures you're not
[1:24:10] going to have true worship but what God
[1:24:13] is wanting is somebody that is
[1:24:15] worshiping him from a heart that's been
[1:24:19] redeemed notice you go to studying out
[1:24:22] these altars throughout the Bible that
[1:24:24] there was the Brazen altar and when you
[1:24:26] go to studying out the Brazen altar if
[1:24:28] you looked at on if the worshiper went
[1:24:30] out there and he looked upon that Brazen
[1:24:32] altar if he's seen there was no blood
[1:24:34] upon it he was a sign of judgment to the
[1:24:38] worshiper but if the altar had blood
[1:24:40] upon it he was not just judgment to him
[1:24:44] but was it was reconciliation to the
[1:24:46] worshiper or that it was the worshiper
[1:24:49] had been reconciled so let me say that
[1:24:52] if you're worshiping god without the
[1:24:54] blood you have a powerless religion the
[1:24:57] only way that God is ever going to
[1:24:59] accept your worship is has got to come
[1:25:01] through the broken blood cell of
[1:25:04] almighty God young people hear me loud
[1:25:06] and clear you can shout you can scream
[1:25:08] but if there's no blood on your altar
[1:25:11] if there's no blood on your altar you're
[1:25:13] shouting does no good
[1:25:16] come on somebody your emotions do you no
[1:25:18] good if there's no blood on your altar
[1:25:21] but thank God
[1:25:23] there is a token that tells us that full
[1:25:26] obedience to the word of God entitles us
[1:25:29] to this broken blood cell the only way
[1:25:33] that God wants to worship if this if
[1:25:35] you're worshiping him not through the
[1:25:37] blood of a red heifer but through the
[1:25:39] blood
[1:25:40] of the Lamb of God that has the ability
[1:25:43] to change your nature roll away your
[1:25:45] sins and make you a new creature in
[1:25:47] Christ Jesus
[1:25:50] Hallelujah but when it come time at the
[1:25:54] evening time in Mount Carmel when this
[1:25:56] nation I want you to catch these
[1:25:59] spiritual thermometer that that Israel
[1:26:02] was in the nation was polluted they were
[1:26:05] worshiping under a backslidden king and
[1:26:08] they were there under wicked wicked
[1:26:10] idolatrous Jezebel that had brought in
[1:26:13] that had brought in nation brought into
[1:26:15] the nation wrote it under idolatry and
[1:26:18] under false worship notice what Jezebel
[1:26:22] had the power to do you think a woman
[1:26:24] don't have power in office watch what
[1:26:26] Jezebel did Jezebel turned the hearts of
[1:26:29] Israel from Jehovah
[1:26:32] this woman had so much sin in her life
[1:26:35] that she turned all of Israel against
[1:26:38] Jehovah so that's why it was key
[1:26:40] importance that God would send the
[1:26:43] spirit of Elijah to go down there to
[1:26:45] Israel and turn the children's Hearts
[1:26:49] back to Jehovah you see Elijah had to
[1:26:52] come into all of this chaos
[1:26:55] I hope you hear me preaching to you
[1:26:57] tonight but Elijah had to come into all
[1:26:59] of this chaos that Israel was in and he
[1:27:03] said he had to call for the supernatural
[1:27:05] to come down that's why Elijah came in
[1:27:07] this hour
[1:27:08] when there was so much chaos there was
[1:27:10] no blood on the altar there was no real
[1:27:13] sacrifice there was no real worship
[1:27:15] because the altar had been broke down
[1:27:20] there was a lot of people that could
[1:27:21] read the Bible there was a lot of people
[1:27:23] that could say some good things there
[1:27:25] was a lot of people that had good points
[1:27:26] but you know that it didn't ever turn
[1:27:29] their hearts back but the spirit of
[1:27:32] Elijah is used over five times in the
[1:27:35] Bible that God will use the very Spirit
[1:27:38] of Elijah what does he do it is a
[1:27:42] restoration ministry under the anointing
[1:27:44] of almighty God to return the heart of
[1:27:48] the children to true worship and when
[1:27:52] Elijah gets up there and he finds that
[1:27:54] the altar is in this kind of condition
[1:27:56] what does he do he calls for a
[1:27:59] supernatural God I'll tell you what he
[1:28:01] does he calls for a showdown between the
[1:28:05] gods of Baal and the Lord God Almighty
[1:28:08] and he begins to say this he said now he
[1:28:11] said if my God Answers by fire then we
[1:28:14] ought to serve him
[1:28:16] but if your God can answer my fire I'll
[1:28:19] tell you how good Elijah was he said
[1:28:21] I'll let you go first
[1:28:23] and they had worshiped all day long
[1:28:28] and they never got anywhere and they're
[1:28:30] screaming they never got anywhere and
[1:28:32] they're hungry they never got anywhere
[1:28:34] and they're prophesying why because the
[1:28:37] altar was broke down
[1:28:39] you can scream you can shout you can CL
[1:28:42] you can confess that Jesus is your Lord
[1:28:44] but if your altar isn't restored you can
[1:28:48] never have fire without a restored altar
[1:28:51] let me say this young people old people
[1:28:53] like you can never have the Holy Ghost
[1:28:56] unless you have a restored altar
[1:29:00] God ain't wanting this material up here
[1:29:03] he's wanting your heart
[1:29:13] it's often hard to worship God in spirit
[1:29:16] and in truth
[1:29:18] if you've got a broken altar
[1:29:21] it's hard to enter into worship when you
[1:29:24] got a broken altar
[1:29:26] it's hard to really it's hard to really
[1:29:28] understand why the moving of the spirit
[1:29:31] is moving like it is with a broken altar
[1:29:34] but notice that when the Baal worshipers
[1:29:37] came notice they came there they made
[1:29:40] their sacrifice they brought it to a
[1:29:42] place where they thought was fitting but
[1:29:45] the rubbish was setting there all around
[1:29:48] the stones were setting there and they
[1:29:50] had not been repaired and brother Madam
[1:29:53] says it over and over again he said now
[1:29:54] what good is Stones if you ain't got a
[1:29:57] stone Mason to shake them out
[1:29:59] he said now what good is it going to do
[1:30:01] to make a confession he said if you
[1:30:03] ain't got a stonemation to turn them
[1:30:05] into a son of God
[1:30:06] again he would say in Jehovah Jireh he
[1:30:09] said he's here now Jehovah Jireh has
[1:30:11] provided for himself he said God is able
[1:30:14] these stones to rise children unto
[1:30:15] Abraham he said if these denominations
[1:30:17] weren't accepted God can bring his
[1:30:20] children from the streets he can bring
[1:30:22] them from the prostitutes out of the
[1:30:24] ends he can raise up anything that he
[1:30:26] wants to but if God has provided a
[1:30:28] message there's somebody somewhere
[1:30:30] that's going to receive it
[1:30:33] if God has provided a message there's
[1:30:35] somebody somewhere that's going to
[1:30:37] receive it he's Jehovah Jireh the Lord
[1:30:40] will provide for himself a message the
[1:30:42] Lord will provide for himself a
[1:30:44] messenger the Lord will provide for
[1:30:46] himself in his own way the signs to the
[1:30:48] church not joining not putting her names
[1:30:50] on the book he said we hear so much
[1:30:52] today about decisions so many decisions
[1:30:54] he said what good does it do to pile up
[1:30:57] rocks if you ain't got Stone Mason there
[1:30:59] to cut them and shake them into Sons and
[1:31:01] Daughters of God
[1:31:04] what good is it going to do for us to
[1:31:06] accumulate a bunch of people if God
[1:31:08] can't turn them into Sons and Daughters
[1:31:10] of God we're not just wanting somebody
[1:31:12] to occupy a Pew we're wanting real sons
[1:31:15] and daughters of God that's got a real
[1:31:18] heart a real Heart of Worship a real
[1:31:21] heart for God
[1:31:22] I ain't looking for the biggest a manner
[1:31:24] but I'm looking for somebody that's got
[1:31:27] to restore heart that knows how to pull
[1:31:29] on the gift of God that wants God over
[1:31:32] anything else in the world take your
[1:31:34] money and do what you want to with it
[1:31:36] but give me my Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:31:39] these young people with vessels that's
[1:31:41] been emptied out I'll take them over the
[1:31:43] richest people in all the world give me
[1:31:46] an altar where there's a real blood
[1:31:48] opponent
[1:31:52] foreign
[1:31:55] but give me Jesus
[1:31:58] come on somebody take this drywall take
[1:32:01] the plaster but give me our vessel
[1:32:06] that wants God
[1:32:10] I don't care if you're acquired as a
[1:32:12] church mouse
[1:32:13] but if you're a man and from your heart
[1:32:15] I can feel you
[1:32:19] I can tell you right now when brother
[1:32:22] Roy and sister Darlene go to move
[1:32:24] when they start pulling on the gift of
[1:32:26] God I can feel them
[1:32:29] it isn't how loud you scream it isn't
[1:32:31] how loud you worship it's from your
[1:32:34] heart
[1:32:40] is that right
[1:32:44] but the altar was broke down
[1:32:47] and the Bible said
[1:32:49] that Elijah came
[1:32:51] and repaired the altar
[1:32:54] you go to setting out that word repair
[1:32:57] it means Rafa
[1:32:59] it means Jehovah Rapha
[1:33:02] laughs it means I am the Healer
[1:33:09] ha him the Healer notice this word in
[1:33:12] the Greek it means to heal
[1:33:14] it means to make healthy
[1:33:16] it means that he's a physician it means
[1:33:20] that he can take the hurts of Nations
[1:33:22] and restore them it means that he can
[1:33:26] take individual distresses and heal them
[1:33:29] he can take broken water and heal the
[1:33:32] waters he can take broken pottery and he
[1:33:35] can heal it
[1:33:36] Hallelujah
[1:33:38] if I would take care tonight just to
[1:33:40] give you a an example if I would take a
[1:33:43] broken vessel a broken glass
[1:33:45] and I would pour I would pour different
[1:33:48] elements together I'd create a fire and
[1:33:50] I'd make the elements of that glass go
[1:33:52] back together but you could still see
[1:33:54] the chips in it
[1:33:57] and then God comes down and takes a
[1:33:59] broken vessel
[1:34:01] and it comes down and he heals The
[1:34:03] Vessel
[1:34:05] which one are you more likely to drink
[1:34:07] from
[1:34:10] you drink from mine you're going to get
[1:34:12] cut
[1:34:13] you drink from the you drink from the
[1:34:15] vessel then I restored or I tried to
[1:34:17] work on it you're going to get cut
[1:34:19] you're going to get scarred it's going
[1:34:21] to hurt you but if you drink from the
[1:34:23] vessel that God has healed
[1:34:29] I don't know if you hear me talking to
[1:34:31] you tonight but God ain't drinking from
[1:34:34] Broken Vessels tonight he's drinking
[1:34:36] from vessels that he's healed
[1:34:39] that is restored
[1:34:41] the Bible says that he is near to them
[1:34:44] that are of a broken heart
[1:34:47] God knows where to find you that's why
[1:34:50] we needed Jehovah Rapha in this hour
[1:34:54] we need a Jehovah Rapha to heal our
[1:34:57] music heal our worship heal our
[1:34:59] doctrines heal our Biblical truths we
[1:35:02] still need Jehovah Rapha
[1:35:06] Hallelujah
[1:35:08] the Bible says he heals
[1:35:10] the broken
[1:35:12] in heart
[1:35:15] he heals the broken altar
[1:35:20] and he binds up their wounds he said
[1:35:22] well I'm too scarred
[1:35:24] my past is too big
[1:35:27] let me tell you
[1:35:28] if you think you got scars
[1:35:31] won't you look at him one time
[1:35:38] look at him one time
[1:35:43] feel those scars
[1:35:45] you feel it every single time
[1:35:47] maybe it's a complex
[1:35:50] that maybe you thought was fixed but let
[1:35:53] somebody say the wrong word
[1:35:56] at the right time
[1:35:58] and all of a sudden you feel that scar
[1:36:00] again
[1:36:01] laughs
[1:36:03] but I want you to know he is Jehovah
[1:36:07] Rapha
[1:36:09] he heals the broken in heart
[1:36:12] he heals and he makes whole and when God
[1:36:15] gets done with something it's worth it
[1:36:21] you may look upon yourself you might
[1:36:23] still see the scars you still might see
[1:36:26] the complexes you might still feel the
[1:36:28] pain but he's not drinking from a broken
[1:36:32] vessel tonight he's drinking he's not
[1:36:34] drinking from a broken cistern he's
[1:36:37] drinking from an Artesian whale in
[1:36:39] vessels that are filled with the Holy
[1:36:41] Ghost
[1:36:44] oh my God
[1:36:47] the heart
[1:36:49] is the altar he said not alone this one
[1:36:52] brother and said he said let us stand
[1:36:54] our feet just a moment you can never
[1:36:56] make an altar call in this place of this
[1:36:58] type he said there's not enough room but
[1:37:00] your heart
[1:37:02] is the altar your heart is where God
[1:37:05] lives again he would say he said now I
[1:37:08] feel led to do this
[1:37:10] he said this is an altar call stand up
[1:37:12] to your feet we have no altar to come to
[1:37:15] he said but your heart
[1:37:20] your heart
[1:37:22] is the altar
[1:37:24] will you bring them over and over again
[1:37:26] go study the message he said Lord I'm
[1:37:29] here and I'm putting myself
[1:37:33] upon the altar
[1:37:35] here's the prophet of the age
[1:37:39] and he puts himself upon the altar
[1:37:43] the prophet still had things that had to
[1:37:45] be burned out of his life
[1:37:47] but too many times we get too religious
[1:37:50] and think well I've been serving God for
[1:37:52] all these years I'm just good the way
[1:37:54] that I am if the prophet had to put
[1:37:57] himself upon the altar then you got to
[1:37:59] put yourself upon the altar it ain't
[1:38:01] just for young people that are going
[1:38:03] through crisis God's wanting every one
[1:38:06] of you
[1:38:08] thank you
[1:38:12] he won he ain't just wanting your
[1:38:15] husband he ain't just wanting your
[1:38:16] children he wants you
[1:38:21] am I preaching to you tonight
[1:38:24] he wants you on the altar he isn't
[1:38:26] wanting the flowers on the altar after
[1:38:28] that day at Easter time altars are
[1:38:30] filled with flowers up on top of flowers
[1:38:33] but brother made him say God don't want
[1:38:35] the Easter Lily on the altar he wants
[1:38:38] you
[1:38:39] Hallelujah he wants you on the altar
[1:38:43] you see God is only going to take what
[1:38:45] you sacrificed to him
[1:38:47] you remember the story about blind
[1:38:48] Bartimaeus how the legend had said that
[1:38:51] blind Bartimaeus he couldn't make a
[1:38:53] living like everybody else so he had
[1:38:55] these two turtle doves that he trained
[1:38:57] them to do certain tricks in the alley
[1:38:58] when people would walk by and they throw
[1:39:00] little coins in and they'd do little
[1:39:01] flips and different things and he made a
[1:39:03] living with those two turtle doves but
[1:39:05] his wife got real sick one time you
[1:39:07] remember she got real sick one time and
[1:39:10] he said he said now Lord if you'll heal
[1:39:12] my wife I'll offer up these these two
[1:39:15] turtle doves tomorrow morning if you'll
[1:39:17] heal my wife and God was as good as
[1:39:20] blind bartimaeus's sacrifice he honored
[1:39:23] him he healed his wife he took those
[1:39:25] turtle doves up there to the place of
[1:39:27] worship and he offered them the almighty
[1:39:29] God but you see in that day that didn't
[1:39:31] have an All-Seeing they didn't have a
[1:39:33] dog that would lead you around the head
[1:39:34] Lambs that would lead you around it was
[1:39:36] his seeing eye lamb that would take him
[1:39:38] around from Street to Street
[1:39:40] and his little daughter got sick one
[1:39:42] time and he said Lord if you'll heal my
[1:39:45] little daughter I will offer unto you
[1:39:48] this lamb of which I am being led by I
[1:39:51] will offer this lamb to you the Lord
[1:39:54] healed his daughter
[1:39:58] now you may not feel this
[1:40:00] but I know I'm right on target
[1:40:07] and he takes this little lamb
[1:40:11] and he takes it up there to the place of
[1:40:13] worship and the high priest knows
[1:40:15] Bartimaeus
[1:40:18] he said now look Lord mace I can't let
[1:40:20] you do this
[1:40:22] can't let you offer this unto God
[1:40:26] because this is the Lamb that gets you
[1:40:28] around
[1:40:30] let me say it like this it was what he
[1:40:33] was leaning on
[1:40:35] it was what he was leaning on to get him
[1:40:37] through life's journey it's what he was
[1:40:39] leaning on he said I'll give you a lamb
[1:40:42] I'll give you a lamb but don't offer
[1:40:44] this lamb he said but look I didn't know
[1:40:47] for God hey land I offered God this lamb
[1:40:51] he said God will provide for me a
[1:40:54] sacrifice God will provide for me a lamb
[1:40:56] at just a few days from that moment he
[1:40:59] was sitting there and people were
[1:41:01] telling him to be quiet but he heard
[1:41:03] that Jesus was passing by that way and
[1:41:07] he screamed out thou son of David have
[1:41:09] mercy upon me what was it the lamb was
[1:41:13] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:41:18] Hallelujah yes well I offered God I
[1:41:21] offered God my I offered God my life if
[1:41:24] it healed my granddaddy I offered God
[1:41:26] this
[1:41:32] and he took it back off the altar
[1:41:38] it's time you get it back on the altar
[1:41:41] I believe there's everybody in this
[1:41:43] building's not in them on the stream too
[1:41:46] let's just preach to them
[1:41:48] every one of them
[1:41:49] need an altar
[1:41:51] from the deacons to the pastors every
[1:41:55] one of us every single day need an altar
[1:41:59] now ain't talking about making sin
[1:42:01] making sin or making Grace a disgrace
[1:42:03] but I'm talking like Paul talked I Die
[1:42:06] daily you've got to lay yourself down
[1:42:09] young people you're going through the
[1:42:11] complexities of life's going through the
[1:42:12] passage of life when your passions are
[1:42:14] running at a high steady steady stream
[1:42:17] and you need a lamb
[1:42:21] but the Bible tells us in Mark 7 and 21
[1:42:25] that from within out of the heart of men
[1:42:28] perceive evil thoughts and adulteries
[1:42:29] and fornications and murders
[1:42:31] foreign
[1:42:34] covetousness wickedness deceit
[1:42:36] lasciviousness and evil eye blasphemy
[1:42:39] and pride and foolishness all these evil
[1:42:41] things come from within and defile the
[1:42:43] man
[1:42:45] said in the word may flesh he said let
[1:42:47] your thoughts run pure your Expressions
[1:42:49] pure live pure be pure
[1:42:53] now out of your heart
[1:42:55] an oldest
[1:42:56] he said out of your heart precedes evil
[1:42:59] thinking adultery and all these
[1:43:00] different things he said if that comes
[1:43:02] out of your heart that's what's in your
[1:43:04] heart
[1:43:07] if all of these evil actions
[1:43:11] it ain't even Facebook no more
[1:43:14] it ain't even Instagram no more
[1:43:18] it's what they call these things reals
[1:43:21] that ain't real at all
[1:43:25] the people are binding their heart to
[1:43:27] these things
[1:43:31] you see those things if it's coming out
[1:43:33] of you all the time that's all you want
[1:43:34] to do
[1:43:35] I'll tell you what this world scares me
[1:43:38] this world scares me that's all that the
[1:43:41] mental people of this day are only able
[1:43:43] to watch it a little 10 second 30 second
[1:43:45] clip anymore
[1:43:46] they have no ability to set down
[1:43:49] and then you come here and said in the
[1:43:51] house of the Lord and you think why in
[1:43:52] the world can't my children sit still
[1:43:54] it's because they've got these little
[1:43:55] cell phones and I don't know why I'm
[1:43:57] here
[1:44:00] let me tell you I get scared by my
[1:44:03] iPhone
[1:44:04] by the things that pop up
[1:44:07] and I know what I got living on the
[1:44:09] inside of me
[1:44:11] and I see parrots walking around and
[1:44:13] letting their children that are five
[1:44:14] years old having little phones
[1:44:17] it scares the very fire out of me
[1:44:20] because I know what Evil's laying there
[1:44:25] they are so innocent but sometimes we
[1:44:28] break their innocency by our ignorance
[1:44:31] to parent them
[1:44:36] [Applause]
[1:44:47] I know that
[1:44:50] if your heart if these things come out
[1:44:52] of your heart
[1:44:56] that shows what's there
[1:44:58] he said but if out of your heart comes
[1:45:02] righteousness if out of your heart comes
[1:45:04] peace love joy Oh my he said then it's
[1:45:07] coming from a resource here that's made
[1:45:09] up of that he said what is it he said
[1:45:12] it's made up of the spirit of God that's
[1:45:14] expressed itself through words and what
[1:45:16] you say then will come to pass you you
[1:45:19] see if it's in your heart if it's on the
[1:45:21] altar then it's got to come forth
[1:45:24] Hallelujah
[1:45:26] can he say Amen to the word of God if
[1:45:28] there's righteousness on the inside of
[1:45:30] you then righteous will come out of you
[1:45:33] we've got words of the words of the
[1:45:35] Prophet or words of the word of God it's
[1:45:37] got to come out of you because out of
[1:45:40] the heart
[1:45:41] the math speakers
[1:45:44] but you see only at evening time could
[1:45:47] the Prophet come and repair the off
[1:45:48] track notice what he did the first thing
[1:45:51] that he did he rode all those stones
[1:45:54] back together
[1:45:56] you see they had their worship they had
[1:45:58] their screaming but they had no altar
[1:46:01] the altar had been torn down but it took
[1:46:04] a prophet to come back and line out how
[1:46:06] the altar had to be built right that's
[1:46:09] why it was so important that God would
[1:46:12] send Elijah in this day to turn our
[1:46:15] broken hearts back to the faith back to
[1:46:18] what back to the original seed that all
[1:46:21] the Mysteries that had been revealed the
[1:46:23] Loose Ends had been tied up and the fire
[1:46:26] came once the altar had been restored
[1:46:29] I'll tell you what brother random said
[1:46:31] he said inspiration struck Elijah so
[1:46:34] much that he called down fire and it
[1:46:36] called down rain in the same day
[1:46:39] I believe that's why you're here tonight
[1:46:41] it's because the inspiration of the Lord
[1:46:43] has come for you to get touched by the
[1:46:46] fire again but I'll say this if you're
[1:46:49] wanting it to rain in your life you
[1:46:51] better get a repaired altar
[1:46:53] it ain't raining three and a half years
[1:46:55] your life's been parts you've got dry
[1:46:58] ground but rebuild the Altar and watch
[1:47:01] the rain come
[1:47:04] that's what you got to do is you've got
[1:47:06] to if you want a Revival you got to
[1:47:08] repair the altar if you want some real
[1:47:11] worship repair your heart
[1:47:17] ah I'm sorry
[1:47:20] I'm sorry
[1:47:23] it's the hardest two words
[1:47:26] to ever say
[1:47:28] not only to your wife but to almighty
[1:47:31] God
[1:47:32] but the reason why David was a man after
[1:47:35] God's Own Heart was because he was quick
[1:47:38] to repent
[1:47:40] and when you learn the power in
[1:47:42] Repentance even when you don't feel like
[1:47:45] you've done anything when you don't feel
[1:47:47] like you're then it is sinning you were
[1:47:49] born in sin shaked in iniquity repair
[1:47:53] the altar
[1:47:54] get blood back upon the altar so you can
[1:47:57] make a real sacrifice of praise
[1:48:03] if you want a Revival
[1:48:06] that is you want to revive at your home
[1:48:08] don't you mamas you want to revive
[1:48:10] what's your home don't you then repair
[1:48:12] the altar brother Burnham said it's too
[1:48:14] many times that we've sat around and
[1:48:17] daddies don't pray in the mornings like
[1:48:18] they used to and mamas don't read their
[1:48:21] Bibles like they used to but when they
[1:48:23] come back home after the events of life
[1:48:25] they say a little bitty simple prayer
[1:48:28] God bless the Joneses God Bless The Maze
[1:48:31] it's God bless this one and God bless
[1:48:33] this one and before long you're slipping
[1:48:35] off
[1:48:36] in the sand
[1:48:38] and you're back into a spot
[1:48:42] well you're no longer praying no more
[1:48:45] but it's time
[1:48:48] I know this is real real Elementary but
[1:48:52] I'm telling you it's going to take you
[1:48:53] to a deep spot
[1:48:55] it'll take you to a deep spot if you can
[1:48:58] roll those stones of Prayer back into
[1:49:01] your life
[1:49:03] roll it back up
[1:49:05] roll back roll it back up roll holding
[1:49:08] us back up in there

[1:49:18] tapes again roll back reading your Bible
[1:49:20] and praying how do I get close to God

[1:49:25] and if you didn't read it right the
[1:49:27] first time and see Christ go back and
[1:49:29] read it again
[1:49:36] my husband's this way my wife's this way
[1:49:38] repair the altar
[1:49:41] well my husband don't necessarily enjoy
[1:49:44] the message like like I enjoy the
[1:49:46] message what did William random teach us
[1:49:48] make him an
[1:49:50] answer show them what it's like to be
[1:49:51] hungry
[1:49:53] show them what it's like to be a real
[1:49:54] Christian
[1:49:56] he ain't telling you go back on apple
[1:49:57] pie maybe he got to maybe you got to do
[1:49:59] that but just live such a life
[1:50:03] that the rest of the world is thirsty
[1:50:08] is hungry
[1:50:10] I have to be honest the rest of the
[1:50:12] world needs what you got
[1:50:16] I don't mean to brag but the rest of the
[1:50:19] world needs what Tom Hill's got the rest
[1:50:22] of the world needs what you sisters got
[1:50:24] because what they are lacking is sitting
[1:50:27] at the throne room of your heart
[1:50:32] brother random said roll up that stone
[1:50:34] of Salvation he said I believe that roll
[1:50:36] up that stolen speaking in tongues I
[1:50:38] believe that roll up that stone of
[1:50:40] interpretation I believe that roll up
[1:50:42] that Stoner Divine Healing I believe
[1:50:44] that he said Brethren if you do that get
[1:50:47] ready for the fire to fall
[1:50:49] he said now I'm just going to I'm going
[1:50:51] to forget about all your reality
[1:50:52] theology Lord I'm just rolling up these
[1:50:55] Stones I'm going to lay myself across
[1:50:57] the altar oh Lord burn me up don't worry
[1:51:00] he will get you
[1:51:04] if you're all alone
[1:51:06] if you're all alone
[1:51:09] God still wants you
[1:51:13] we had testimony service the other night
[1:51:16] heard people saying they relied on this
[1:51:17] one and relied on that one let me tell
[1:51:19] you there's going to tons of times in
[1:51:20] your life when you can't rely on nobody
[1:51:23] Friends Are Gonna Let You Down they
[1:51:25] won't show up they won't pray with you
[1:51:27] that's proof In The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:51:30] that friends will never keep you you can
[1:51:33] rely on your friends and I believe it's
[1:51:34] great things they're strength and unity
[1:51:37] that strength in numbers but when you
[1:51:39] can't rely on your friends when friends
[1:51:42] let you down when mamas and daddies walk
[1:51:45] away from you Jesus said I'll never
[1:51:47] leave you and I'll never forsake you
[1:51:49] he'll be with you even in you till the
[1:51:51] end of the world he's a friend that's
[1:51:53] six closer than a brother
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:58] roll them Stones back up there
[1:52:01] roll them Stones back up there that's
[1:52:03] why Peter said you're living stones
[1:52:05] you're a living example you're a
[1:52:07] spiritual house you're a holy priesthood
[1:52:09] barium Branham said in stature a perfect
[1:52:12] man he said God never sent me down here
[1:52:14] to preach or build denominations but he
[1:52:16] sent me here to build individuals that
[1:52:18] they might be a spiritual Powerhouse
[1:52:20] unto almighty God
[1:52:23] let me tell you let me go a little bit
[1:52:25] deeper for you that have been really
[1:52:27] studying the message we know where we're
[1:52:29] at we know where we're standing at our
[1:52:32] altar has been restored we've got the
[1:52:34] full truth we've got the opening up of
[1:52:36] the word thou must prophesy again speak
[1:52:39] what the word says when the altar is
[1:52:42] right you can call for Fire and Fire
[1:52:44] will fall you can call for the Dynamics
[1:52:47] and the Dynamics will fall you can call
[1:52:49] for healing and healing will come we
[1:52:52] believe
[1:52:53] therefore we speak you cannot speak if
[1:52:56] you have a broken altar or a broken
[1:52:58] heart the things that are in your heart
[1:53:02] is the things that you will do and the
[1:53:05] things that you will say because out of
[1:53:07] the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:53:09] speakeas Deuteronomy 30 and 41 4 14 the
[1:53:15] word is Navi even in thy mouth and in
[1:53:18] thy heart
[1:53:21] the word
[1:53:23] is in you
[1:53:24] it's on your altar
[1:53:27] that you might just let it lay down
[1:53:29] but thou
[1:53:31] must May us do it the words there
[1:53:35] the words there it's in your heart it's
[1:53:38] in your mouth speak the word
[1:53:41] let me tell you
[1:53:43] we done rolled up the stones of Divine
[1:53:45] Healing so I recognize that cancer has
[1:53:47] no ability to hold me back
[1:53:51] let me tell you we met an angel in a
[1:53:53] cave in this age that told us a cancer
[1:53:56] was nothing almighty God it's already
[1:53:58] been rolled back up there
[1:54:00] things are put back in place
[1:54:03] let me tell you thank God for a prophet
[1:54:05] if it wasn't been for a prophet meet an
[1:54:08] angel in a cave we would stand here as a
[1:54:10] church
[1:54:11] and be fearful of this thing
[1:54:14] but because we rolled up the stones of
[1:54:17] Divine Healing back up there and the
[1:54:20] fire fell upon it I'll tell you what
[1:54:22] it's time to do it's time to climb Mount
[1:54:24] Carmel again and find out if God's still
[1:54:26] God
[1:54:28] hallelujah it's time we climb Mount
[1:54:30] Carmel it's time we go back up here to
[1:54:33] Pentecost see the god that answers by
[1:54:35] fire and see if he's the same yesterday
[1:54:36] today and forever
[1:54:39] now I know I done told you you can be a
[1:54:41] church in quiet Mouse Grandma Mouse
[1:54:43] Squad be here but I don't mind you Amen
[1:54:45] in the word of God tonight
[1:54:48] is that right
[1:54:49] we've rolled up those stones we're not
[1:54:52] afraid to say Amen
[1:54:54] we're not afraid of dancing in a church
[1:54:56] we rolled up them Stones we're not
[1:54:59] afraid to worship Him in spirit and
[1:55:01] Truth why because we rode up them stones
[1:55:07] Hallelujah you're a living Stone you're
[1:55:09] a living example you're exemplifying
[1:55:11] what God wants done in this hour
[1:55:16] let me tell you there's no reason why
[1:55:19] we can't have healings in this church
[1:55:23] tonight
[1:55:25] why because we rolled up them stones
[1:55:29] I know what I'm talking about we rode up
[1:55:31] them Stones one night and we got to
[1:55:33] talking about a quote where William
[1:55:34] Branham said now you that are dealing
[1:55:36] with arthritis stomp your feet
[1:55:39] you remember and I said now you that's
[1:55:41] got diabetes said you that's got sugar
[1:55:43] stomp on that thing I know what I'm
[1:55:45] talking about we rode them Stones up and
[1:55:48] Jim Noel had dealt with sugar problems
[1:55:50] ever since a certain thing in his life
[1:55:52] and when he rode the stone up and
[1:55:54] recognized that the altar was back sugar
[1:55:57] diabetes left his body in that service
[1:56:01] I'm telling you that no matter what you
[1:56:04] have need of the stones of Divine
[1:56:06] Healing have been rolled back into place
[1:56:10] ask
[1:56:13] let me drop some to you if everything's
[1:56:15] right here
[1:56:16] [Applause]
[1:56:18] everything's right here then you can ask
[1:56:20] whatever you will and it shall be
[1:56:23] granted unto you why you rolled those
[1:56:25] things up
[1:56:32] but too many times people try to roll
[1:56:34] them things away and say it ain't for us
[1:56:36] and there's for days gone by or it's
[1:56:38] just for the prophet John 14 12 just for
[1:56:40] the prophet absolutely not
[1:56:43] the words that I do shall you do also
[1:56:46] and Greater Works than me say you do
[1:56:49] because I go into my father
[1:56:52] while we rolled up them Stones I tell
[1:56:55] you that we're living an hour where you
[1:56:57] can know that you got the baptism of the
[1:56:59] Holy Ghost because Jesus said in John 14
[1:57:01] and 20 that at that day you shall know
[1:57:04] that I'm in the father and the father
[1:57:06] and me and I and you and you and me I'm
[1:57:08] telling you young people that you are
[1:57:10] living in an hour where you can know you
[1:57:12] got the Holy Ghost why because them
[1:57:14] things been rolled up I'll tell you
[1:57:16] right now I feel the Dynamics working in
[1:57:19] the bride's body
[1:57:21] and I'm challenging you to believe that
[1:57:24] all them things are rolled back up the
[1:57:26] heart's been restored your Faith's been
[1:57:28] restored you believe that all things are
[1:57:30] possible
[1:57:31] because Elijah came and Jehovah Rapha
[1:57:34] healed your heart
[1:57:41] William brand I'm standing there in
[1:57:43] India
[1:57:44] and there's a man or a boy that comes to
[1:57:47] him that's deaf and dumb
[1:57:49] and he said it was like a Mount Carmel
[1:57:52] Showdown again
[1:57:53] he's out standing there he said now he
[1:57:56] said let the god that answers let him be
[1:57:59] God
[1:58:00] he said now if your Gods could come up
[1:58:02] here and heal this deaf and dumb boy you
[1:58:03] come up here and do it he said but if my
[1:58:06] God is God
[1:58:07] let him come up here let him show that
[1:58:10] he's God William Brenham said he prayed
[1:58:12] a real simple prayer and he clapped his
[1:58:14] hands together
[1:58:17] he clapped his hands together he said
[1:58:19] that boy pulled on his ears and he was
[1:58:21] hearing and talking as good as anybody
[1:58:24] else in the building he said now them
[1:58:26] people had been Pagan worshipers or
[1:58:28] Heathen worshipers and he said all they
[1:58:30] seen was a demonstration of the Holy
[1:58:32] Ghost and he said they tried to worship
[1:58:33] me he said they didn't know what they
[1:58:35] was doing they'd never seen anything
[1:58:37] like that before he said not the problem
[1:58:39] was he said is that the word hadn't been
[1:58:42] rightly represented to them
[1:58:46] he said the word hadn't been represented
[1:58:48] to them exactly right he said it only
[1:58:50] been dead that represented to them in
[1:58:53] doctrines and in pamphlets and he said
[1:58:55] now he said I'm a 100 for them pamphlets
[1:58:57] and for the doctrines he said but it's
[1:58:59] only he said it's only represented to
[1:59:01] you in so much you see everything hadn't
[1:59:04] been shown to them yet so they didn't
[1:59:06] know how to really worship he said but
[1:59:08] now I'm showing to you the god of the
[1:59:11] word is going to back up his word and
[1:59:13] that boy that was deaf and dumb was
[1:59:15] completely made whole he said in the
[1:59:18] next night he said there they LED that
[1:59:20] man up there by a chain around his neck
[1:59:22] you know the story what was it it was
[1:59:25] God showing that the stones of Divine
[1:59:27] Healing
[1:59:29] had been rolled back I'm telling you the
[1:59:32] rollback in these young people's life
[1:59:36] I believe it's going to be Reagan's and
[1:59:38] I believe it's going to be India's that
[1:59:40] are going to take a body change I
[1:59:42] believe it's going to be some Abigails I
[1:59:44] believe it's going to be some witness
[1:59:46] that have rolled back the restoration of
[1:59:49] the Altar and believe that all things
[1:59:51] are possible
[1:59:53] let me tell you you're not a weak bunch
[1:59:56] of Christians the Bible said in second
[1:59:58] or second Corinthians 5 and 17 that if
[2:00:01] any man be in Christ he is a new
[2:00:03] creature and old things are passed away
[2:00:05] and behold all things are become new now
[2:00:08] that don't mean you're some weak some
[2:00:10] staggering in here just some weak
[2:00:12] forgiving that you're only just forgiven
[2:00:14] of your sins but it means you're a new
[2:00:16] creature it means you've got the nature
[2:00:19] of God you've been created in Christ
[2:00:21] Jesus you've got the ability of God our
[2:00:24] faith
[2:00:26] has become as strong as our fear was
[2:00:30] before our change
[2:00:34] you know what it's like to fear you know
[2:00:36] what it's like to worry but when you you
[2:00:38] got changed
[2:00:40] your faith was as strong as your fear
[2:00:43] was out there
[2:00:45] comes to you control because you are
[2:00:48] born again son and daughter of God
[2:00:51] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[2:00:53] our faith tells us that we're secure our
[2:00:56] faith tells us that God himself has put
[2:00:58] Satan and all of his kingdom underneath
[2:01:00] of our feet and we are considered by our
[2:01:03] almighty God and Satan himself to be the
[2:01:06] Victorious bride of Jesus Christ
[2:01:09] what is it we've been liberated in our
[2:01:11] faith we've been liberated in our
[2:01:13] worship we've been liberated in our
[2:01:15] praise
[2:01:16] that's why Peter said you're a royal
[2:01:17] priesthood a chosen generation A
[2:01:20] peculiar people
[2:01:22] you got some Authority about you
[2:01:25] you got some tenacity about you because
[2:01:27] God's backing you up
[2:01:34] I don't believe there's no reason why we
[2:01:35] can't have missing limbs come back and
[2:01:37] be restored right here in this service
[2:01:47] thank you
[2:01:49] he said you're crazy
[2:01:51] no I'm not
[2:01:54] when William Branham comes and he
[2:01:55] preaches in the fifth seal that there's
[2:01:57] coming an hour
[2:01:58] that there's going to come missing on
[2:02:00] him
[2:02:01] he said it's going to come to pass he
[2:02:03] said it's going to come to pass
[2:02:04] why was he saying these things was
[2:02:06] because just before he preaches that
[2:02:09] seal he's dealing with a little girl
[2:02:11] that's got leukemia and they're got
[2:02:14] cancer all through her blood cell but
[2:02:17] William Branham prays for that Lord or
[2:02:19] girl and he said God recreated the blood
[2:02:23] cell again what is it God
[2:02:27] has came in this hour and recreated our
[2:02:30] faith to believe that all things are
[2:02:32] possible
[2:02:34] not worshiping from a Baptist idea
[2:02:36] you're not worshiping from a church of
[2:02:38] Christ's idea you're worshiping under
[2:02:40] the auspices of the Holy Ghost
[2:02:43] a restored altar a restored worship and
[2:02:46] restored faith
[2:02:50] he can recreate the blood cell
[2:02:54] call me crazy but I believe we can have
[2:02:56] a cancer-free report
[2:02:59] call me crazy
[2:03:02] but I believe
[2:03:05] I believe with everything that's within
[2:03:07] me that there's going to be an hour that
[2:03:10] there'll be this church so drunk on the
[2:03:13] holy ghost that all of us will be
[2:03:15] speaking in tongues all of us will be
[2:03:17] interpreting and one of these moments
[2:03:19] call me crazy
[2:03:22] but in this churches of people that are
[2:03:25] destined for the transition it wasn't
[2:03:28] just for Enoch it's for me we've got our
[2:03:31] Stones rolled back in place
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:39] call me crazy but I believe you can live
[2:03:41] this message
[2:03:47] call me crazy
[2:03:50] he ain't seen nothing yet
[2:04:00] the farther we go and the harder we
[2:04:02] press into this message the more we find
[2:04:05] out that every stone has been rolled
[2:04:07] back
[2:04:08] it wasn't just for William Branham to
[2:04:11] lay hands on somebody and they'd be
[2:04:13] recovered it wasn't just for him to be
[2:04:15] thousands of miles from his wife when
[2:04:17] they laid hands upon her and that tumor
[2:04:20] was gone it wasn't just for him to call
[2:04:22] down storms and cast them out of
[2:04:25] existence
[2:04:27] foreign
[2:04:28] I'm gonna tell you something the stone
[2:04:30] of the third pole has been rolled back
[2:04:31] in place and it's for this body
[2:04:37] I don't feel no different
[2:04:39] good because that's where God wants you
[2:04:42] at is when you don't feel like lightning
[2:04:44] and when you don't feel like fire
[2:04:47] that God can come over top of you little
[2:04:50] Samson and you destroy a thousand for
[2:04:53] listings
[2:04:55] God don't need your strength he just
[2:04:58] wants your restored altar
[2:05:07] I've been studying all year round on
[2:05:09] this hanging I'm done I'm done tonight
[2:05:11] I've been studying all year long
[2:05:15] on the rain
[2:05:17] you've been hearing me preach about it
[2:05:18] all year long but I want to tell you if
[2:05:21] you've got a restored alter get ready
[2:05:24] the rain's coming
[2:05:26] he said well man I wish I could
[2:05:28] experience a lot of rain you're in it
[2:05:31] wish I could experience a holy ghost
[2:05:33] you're in it
[2:05:36] I want to experience the rain I feel it
[2:05:39] in this room
[2:05:41] I feel the anointing I'm feeling
[2:05:44] persuading I feel it pushy you're in the
[2:05:47] midst of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:54] let me tell you you're under the
[2:05:56] announcement that the rain is coming
[2:05:58] [Applause]
[2:06:02] let the musicians come
[2:06:05] I was reading I was listening this week
[2:06:07] I heard brother man talking about it he
[2:06:09] said if you ever go out there
[2:06:11] I believe it's in letting off pressure
[2:06:13] he said if you ever go out there he said
[2:06:16] before a dry ground before Parks ground
[2:06:18] he said if you get out there before a
[2:06:20] storm comes he said you can feel the
[2:06:22] breeze coming
[2:06:24] he said you can feel the breeze coming
[2:06:26] I knew I had this laying here in my
[2:06:28] heart I walked outside before the rain
[2:06:30] came today
[2:06:32] I walked out there if you'd have been
[2:06:34] standing there somebody passed by to the
[2:06:35] thought I was crazy
[2:06:37] that's how everybody else does anyway
[2:06:40] I stand out there and what was I waiting
[2:06:42] on I was waiting for the announcement to
[2:06:44] come
[2:06:45] because I'd already heard that it was
[2:06:47] coming I didn't heard across my phone
[2:06:50] that there was a bad thunderstorm that
[2:06:52] was coming and I knew what the prophet
[2:06:54] said about a breeze coming was an
[2:06:57] announcement that the rain was on its
[2:06:59] way so I stood out there I waited five
[2:07:02] minutes I waited 10 minutes
[2:07:05] but all of a sudden I felt the breeze
[2:07:08] hit me in the face what was it it was
[2:07:11] the announcement that the rain is here
[2:07:14] and the wind of the Holy Ghost is moving
[2:07:17] in this place you may have been waiting
[2:07:19] here five years ten years 15 years but
[2:07:22] the breeze of the Holy Ghost is
[2:07:24] announcing to you that the Holy Ghost
[2:07:27] reign
[2:07:30] is here
[2:07:32] is here
[2:07:34] it's here
[2:07:36] the anointing is here the holy God says
[2:07:39] here the word shall it be here
[2:07:47] I know what I'm talking about
[2:07:50] I know what I'm talking about
[2:07:52] but you know how much I love this
[2:07:54] I love this atmosphere I love this
