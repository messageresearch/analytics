and everything and so you know he left there with questions and not really answers of what was going on but i told him sometimes with cancer patients quirky things happen and you know whether it was a

have it amen thankful to see you all flipping through the pages of your bible it's the greatest it's the greatest sound in the earth and they came over onto the other side of the sea into the country of the gatherings and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit who had his dwelling amongst the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshiped him and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit notice jesus wasn't jumping up and down jesus wasn't screaming jesus wasn't raising his voice but he simply said come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country now there were now there was there nigh under the mountains a great herd of swine feeding and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and they and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about 2 000 and were choked in the sea god bless you you may be seated this morning we realized this morning that that we're holding in our hand the greatest the greatest thing that we could hold in our hands this morning and that is the word of god and we realize and we're very very pertinent and very understanding in god's word that his word is his voice and that god is the creator of all things there's not one thing that is made that that he didn't make and because we understand that god is the creator of life and we understand that that god holds all things in his hands there's not anything that was made that was that that was made without him because the bible would tell us in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god you cannot separate god from his voice and and the bible says in colossians chapter 1 and 16 that for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist i could say that we would completely agree this morning that that god is the creator of all things is that right this morning and so we understand that god is the creator of all things and we get a glimpse of god in his creation work when we look back into the genesis when we look back in the beginning and we see that in the beginning that god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the bible said that the spirit of god moved out across the waters and god said let there be light now you could see as a prophet would catch that he said i could see him as he's saying those things as he's moving out across that he said there's not even an atom or anything there he said but then all of a sudden he speaks and an atom breaks and adam breaks and it goes off and he creates a sun and he said it goes off for a millions of millions of years and then a little clinker falls off of that and it and he lets it fall for before millions and millions of years he said it's a sun that is coming off of that the piece of that sun it's a star coming off of that and he lets it fall and he lets it come to its spot in its position there was nothing that could stop it until it got to its place of position which god had ordained it to be him and god spoke those words and he said let there be and god believed his own word god believed what he said that the thing that he spoke was going to come to pass and how did he interpret that by bringing it to pass i'd say this morning that we all did not just gather here we didn't just come here just to see one another we didn't just come here out of formality's sake or out of tradition's sake i believe that every one of us that are that are sitting here truly within my heart i believe that everyone that is sitting here this morning has come to hear the voice of god i know that sometimes the preaching gets hard and it seems like it's cutting and it's and it's driving at you but that is not towards you that is driving at the spirit of the day but i really believe with all of my heart that every person that's sitting here has come here with an intention on hearing the voice of god now sometimes when god speaks he'll speak directly to you or maybe he'll speak through a preacher or maybe he'll speak through maybe one another but sometimes when god speaks he'll he'll drop a word right in your heart at a very very pertinent time in your life and and you'll realize maybe maybe it was a preacher that had had preached a sermon maybe a year ago and then all of a sudden god stirred it up in your mind and he brought it to your remembrance and all of a sudden god begins to speak to your life on certain questions that you've had and he begins to speak to you and he begins to line out all the questions that you have and you knew that it was god speaking to you sometimes he will speak to us sometimes he isn't it isn't always an audible voice but sometimes he speaks directly to you through maybe a brother or sister in christ or maybe he'll speak to you this morning by the preaching of the word i i believe that's what he does is by the preaching of the word and so we we see that when when god goes to speaking that his people always recognize that it's god speaking and we we look out in the service and i'd say that with all of my heart that jesus is here and whenever the pillar of fire is visible it's a vindication that god is wanting to speak then you know there's sometimes that you're just asking that that you need you maybe lay a fleece out before the lord and you want to know something or you're looking at this situation now god this is this is what i got to do i remember one time in my life i remember predominantly one time in my life there's been many times that god has spoken to me and i've heard his voice speak to my heart and heard him speak and it sounded like a big thunderclap went off and he just basically called my name and i knew that he was speaking to me and nobody else in the room was having a clue what was going on but i was being revealed to me something was being revealed to me that only i even knew was what was going on but i remember one time predominantly in my life when i was when i was seeking to hear the voice of god and that was when i was when i felt a call to go into the ministry and preach this gospel i had run i'd run with everything that was on the with inside of me and i'd done my very best but you can run but you can't hide from god and and i was i had come to a spot and i believe that if god's ordained you to a position that god will get you there no matter what and have you ever run from something that you were destined to do in your life and have you ever run from something that you are meant to do in life you are built to do in life what sure you have you were built to be a son and daughter of god but you spent half of your life running away from god running away from his promises but one day the spirit of the lord came by your way and he called your name and you knew that it was him speaking to you but i shut myself in and i had felt this call and it even got to a spot that my wife was sitting at the kitchen table and said when you're going to stop running i said well i don't know i'll just keep on running i tried my best to run from it but it got so and i'm only just bringing this to you so you understand that sometimes you get to a spot when you get desperate that you got to hear the voice of god and i shut myself in a closet and i shut myself in my upper room and i got up there and i said now god if this is what you want me to do i'm not going unless i hear your voice i'm not going out there because i feel something i'm not going out there because somebody else seen that i was carrying this gospel i'm going out there because i specifically heard from you i shut myself in that room for hours upon hours and then all of a sudden i heard a voice speak to me turn to isaiah 30 and 21 that my ears will hear a voice behind me saying walk ye in this way when you turn to the left and when you turn to the right when i heard that voice i was running one way but when i heard that voice i started running with everything within me toward that voice that told me to walk in this way and he's never left me and he won't leave you when he calls your name he won't leave you in your calling maybe your call is just a housewife but he's not going to leave you in that call he's going to be right there with you maybe he's called you to be a businessman in this day he's not going to leave you he's going to speak to you he's got life on the inside of you you are his voice you are his life you are his feet you are his hands and if anybody's gonna be a voice of god today let it be the voice of full gospel lighthouse hallelujah hallelujah even nature has got to obey his voice that if there's something laying there that's on the inside and only if that seed has been dramatized it's got to come up even nature itself has to listen to the voice of god it recognizes its presence and many times when we go to thinking about the voice of god and we begin to think about the pillar of fire and nature obeying you all remember you were here at brother steve thomas's funeral and you remember that brother steve lived a a real godly life and brother steve came and we had his funeral here and and we had flowers all decorated around this altar here and the pillar of fire stood behind this pulpit and moved across this altar and when it did there was flowers that were setting here that had not yet bloomed yet but when that pillar of fire went across those flowers they begin to bloom in the presence of the sun you see anything that's got life in it when the sun goes passing by its way it's got to come forth you know you where you get your best grass out the best looking grass is right beside the concrete you see you can try to lay anything you want to on top of that seed you can cover it up with concrete you can cover it up with sin you can cover it up with unbelief you can cover it up with doubt but if there is a dermatitis seed laying there when the sun goes to calling for that seed it's got to come forth it's got to come forth and though you might be running though you might have questions though you might wonder why i'm the thunder am i here at the house of god this morning i happen to believe this morning maybe i'm just crazy enough to believe it if you're sitting there in that condition i would say that god has got something on the inside of you that is one to resurrect and if you are his child that voice will raise you up that voice caught a dead man that had been laying in the grave for four days over in another world but that body of lazarus had to obey the voice of god when he said lazarus come forth maybe he'll scream out anna come forth maybe he'll scream like josh come forth you can sit there in your dead cold formal religion or you can come to the voice this morning hallelujah he controls all things he's in control this morning can we say that this morning he's in control of this service he's in control of our lives he's in control of everything so who's controlling you who's controlling your life who's controlling is it satan if satan is controlling your life you know that there is a perversion there but god is wanting to so control your storms he's so wanting to control your life and speak life and peace to your storms i was reading this past week over in in mark chapter 4 and i was reading over here and it's a very familiar scripture to each and every one of us that when jesus had been doing and went about the father's work that he went out and he and he was preaching the gospel and the bible said that jesus laid in the back into the boat laid his head down on a pillow and went to sleep and and i've read that story and we watch and we see how that the storm obeyed what jesus said when they woke up jesus but i caught something this week when i was reading over those things that there was three fears in this picture there was first of fear upon the disciples that they were fearful that they would perish and that they would be destroyed but then they woke up jesus the second fear that i seen in the picture was also that when jesus put his foot up there and he stood up in his authority and he stood said to the storm and he said peace to that storm that the storm had to obey what jesus said i believe there's so much power in the voice of god that he can control your storms this morning but then the bible said that the disciples exceedingly were fearful this was a different fear from the fear that you had just seen just maybe a few scriptures beforehand but this was a godly fear that even the winds and the waves have to obey him but there's another third fear in the picture if you ain't seen it yet have hallelujah the storm was so fearful of jesus's voice that it had to run for cover i want to say to you this morning that the devil is scared about what's about to be said you see he's going to try to throw up a storm he's going to try to throw up a storm to keep you from your breakthrough he's going to try to throw up all kinds of chaos in your life to keep you from your victory he's going to throw up all kinds of all kinds of blocks in your life to keep you from getting the holy ghost i believe with all of my heart last night what happened to brother on was a storm that was trying to stop somebody from getting a breakthrough this morning i don't care about covet i don't care what you got going on in your mind today if you need a refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost i pray that you come to this altar and get so filled up that the devil gets scared of your voice if you are not making satan shaking his boots you don't have the right voice but you ain't got to leave here that way hallelujah you see there was a storm before legion got his breakthrough hallelujah maybe his name's not legion today maybe it's maybe it's your name maybe it's where you're sitting at maybe it's you listening by the way the internet but there might be a storm that's come up recently in your life that's trying to keep you from a breakthrough but i want to tell you jesus is coming jesus is coming the seas the seas even got mad because we know that the enemy has control over the power of the air and he got behind the wind and he perverted the wind he got behind the waves and he perverted the waves and he tried to kill jesus whoo hallelujah you can't kill the author of life and if the author of life is living on the inside of you he can't kill you you might go to a grave but you're going to raise up one of these mornings the voice of resurrection is in the body and if you are his hallelujah some of you may run before me but if you go by the way of the grave you'll be the first ones that raise up on resurrection morning [Applause] oh hallelujah and we're coming right behind you that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we shall be caught up to meet our maker hallelujah hallelujah the prophet would say that you are hanging over hail by a chain and that chain is as strong as its weakest link and he said you're hanging over top of hail by a chain of the word and he said when a believer takes when a believer becomes a make-believer and lives on one word that's contrary to the word he cuts his fellowship with god and he breaks that link you remember that your faith in this word is like a chain and when you break that fellowship with god you are hanging over top of hell i want you to know that hale was looking for some trophies this morning hell ain't interested in politicians because he's got most of them hale ain't interested in bootleggers because he's got most of them hale ain't interested in the democrats he ain't interested in republicans because he's got most of them hell ain't even interested with your localities down here hell is interested in stopping you from who you ordained to be hell's not interested in dope addicts hail's not interested in alcoholics because he's already got them but i want to tell you god's interested in them god's interested in politics god's interested in the government god's interested in dope addicts he's so interested that he wants to call to them oh hallelujah god is looking for sons that will put his word into action you see god needed a son when all of humanity was in a fallen condition god was looking for a son when adam heeded his wife's voice and instead of god's voice god was looking for a son man had constantly failed god jacob cheated david had an affair noah got drunk jonah ran from god gideon was insecure elijah got depressed moses stuttered man was constantly failing him he was constantly failing because he would get so high and he could not get above it but when it come to jesus jesus was not just an ordinary man he was a man that had the fullness of redemption that he was the true image of god that he was a reflection of god and he understood the plan of redemption and he would say i can do nothing unless my father in heaven chose me first he was such a man he was such a son that he would only do what the father told him to do you have the power to create a new world but you can only do what the father tells you to do you see he was looking for a son he was looking for a son that would go places that nobody else would go hallelujah he was looking for somebody that was willing to go where the pharisees wasn't willing to go when i brought brother denny and brought brother josh up here last evening you thought i was just doing that just to get somebody to come up here but it began to come to my mind when i had these two men standing before me that these two men would be just like the great mighty men of valor that was willing to go and get david the king of fresh drink of water and pour it out before him and say i'm willing to go all the way you see there was a lot of people that wasn't willing to go by brother denny's way there was a lot of people that wasn't willing to go by brother josh's way but jesus was interested in coming by their way and if you only if you only knew their story you would understand their amen you would understand their shout you would understand their amen you would understand why they get happy because jesus was willing to go where nobody else would go to god needed a son that could be rejected god needed a son that could be beat god needed a son that could be ridiculed when he's sitting in simon's house if you invite jesus he'll come he'll come to you this morning you may not know how to ask him to come but if you ask him just say lord i don't know exactly how to pray this i don't know exactly how to say this i don't know if i got to hold my hands this way or do that but if you can just bow your heart and you say god i want you to come by my way he'll come by your way it doesn't matter how bad your life is wrecked up he'll come by your way if you invite him but then you got to make him feel welcome but jesus was the type of son that he was willing to go where nobody else would go when he's sitting at simon's house everybody's making fun of him he ain't got no new robe he ain't got a kiss and he's sitting there with dirty feet but there was a woman that didn't have an invitation that was also rejected but she gave jesus the right kind of invitation hallelujah you see jesus knew before he ever made a trip to simon's house what was going to happen and he was sitting there and even simon and even some of jesus's old disciples said if he knew what type of woman that was doing that act to him you would not consider him a prophet but he was willing hallelujah to let this take place because the sacrifice had to be washed oh hallelujah and jesus turned to them he turned to them this woman that had no right in their eyes to be at jesus feet you didn't welcome me you didn't welcome me with a kiss you didn't pour the oil upon me you you just sent an invitation but you didn't even make me feel welcome you only brought me here to make a mockery of me oh i said it last night but it's worth repeating again today satan can try to mock he can try to disrupt god's plans when satan comes with plans it's only a set up for god's opportunities to go to work in your life and satan might try to mock you this morning he might try to reject you this morning but it's a setup it's a setup for god to work something in your life how many of the pharisees would have allowed this to happen but god needed a son some of you are in that spot some of you are in the same spot when everybody else is give up hope when everybody else is saying there's no hope for you that you've done all these things wrong you've lied you cheated you stole you've done all kinds of things you're in the same boat but i want you to know that you can come to jesus's feet this morning you can pour your old alpine out upon him you can water his feet with tears and you can dry them with your hair i want you to know there's a lot of people that would have gave up on you but jesus won't give up when i can't go no further jesus will go further when the preacher can't go when the pastor can't go when the prophet can't go jesus will go hallelujah it's all about him hallelujah now let me come down to your predestination you're his people you're a peculiar treasure heaven and earth is his nature is his but you are his treasure you are his purchase price you are a blood washed blood bought bride of jesus christ fully standing there in your redemption this morning wrapped in the robe of redemption and you've got all of heaven behind you you are his and god is not willing to share you with the devil i tell you god is stingy when it comes to his children he's not willing that satan would snatch you out of out of his hands just like in the beginning satan tried to snatch you out of god's retentive plan but mercy said no god said i'm big enough satan ain't got enough but i'm more than enough [Music] hallelujah a lot of people look at the cross and they see a beautiful cross it's a rugged cross that's where he paid for my redemption and when i look at that cross i don't see a beautiful cross i see a blood stained cross that said i'm more than enough to go to the uttermost and snatch my people out of the devil's hands hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he's not willing that your spirit would be contaminated that's why he's preaching to you these things because his voice will go into your spirit and it'll break up those things that are holding you bound that's why he's preaching these things is that he will go in there and he'd break up those things that are trying to contaminate your life there's another king a king of chaos that's trying to control your life and trying to put things in your spirit but god's not willing that your spirit would be contaminated just like when sarah went into the king's palace god was not willing that her womb would be contaminated with another seed that seed was gone that wound was going to bring forth life praying it would be a royal royal priesthood that would come out of that lineage and he was not willing that that that womb would be contaminated by another man's seed and god spoke to him in a dream and said restore the man his wife hallelujah hallelujah restore the man his wife satan i want you to hear me take your hands off of god's property and restore the man his wife god's not willing that your spirit would be contaminated with some cold formal creed but he wants your womb so filled up with the quickening power of jesus christ that only his seed could bring forth that predestinated life there's power in this voice to change your life there's power in this voice to take you from a ragged man a wretched man a miserable man where you're so sick and tired of living the way you're living there's power in this voice to resurrect you you may be on a path of drugs you may be on a path of sin you may be on a path of all kinds of unfilthy of filthy things and filthy living his voice is going to break it up this morning i didn't come here just to play church this morning i come here with a mission on my mind i'm coming after god's children and if he has to use my voice so be it this morning speak to the storm it'll obey you hallelujah hallelujah don't notice this he said i went to a dying child a few nights ago and laying in the hospital had a premature baby and that had died had i had to be a caesarean baby had been dead for four or five days uremic poisoning oh such a fixed heart hard to give a blood transfusion the heart had enlarged him so many times and doctor says she can't live two more hours speaking of the woman she was backslid but while speaking to her and said sister you was baptized there and on a cradle you rolled into the tabernacle she said brother brandon i've wandered far away she said but oh i got married i married a center boy and i just i couldn't live it she said last summer i was just about to drown and i screamed out for mercy and she said god god warned me to come back that my time was at hand he said i didn't come i said now here it is again and i knew you was in town so i sent for you brother brandon struggling through a breath under the oxygen tent and then we got down i said sister jesus is just as willing to take you back today as he was the day he accepted you at that altar and he's more willing because you're still his child just out of his will hallelujah and there through the struggles she turned her face towards god the tears running down our young cheeks 18 month old baby living and one dead within and pray in the prayer of faith and in less than five minutes time that woman was sitting up under that oxygen tent saying brother branham something's happened in my soul i'm right with god again and there when the doctors looked at it and look something's happened said i believe in the morning we'll just take the baby for an operation see what a difference is when the anointing of god comes down where she was once scared of thinking oh it's just this it's this it's this but when god spoke then everything let loose [Music] you're still his child you're just out of his will you can run but you can't hide you're still his child you're still his child you listen to this by the way of the internet you're still his child you might be out of his will but he ain't never lost you he's had his eye on you the whole time satan can try all he wants to but he ain't gonna get you you're just out of his will the son was willing to go here how many people could raise their hand and say that somebody wrote you off in life keep your hand up there somebody wrote you off in life said you never gonna make it said you wasn't good enough said you never get the baptism of the holy ghost he was rolled off in life i know where you're standing at legion was that type of man he'd been rolled off by the whole community he'd been rolled off mother branham would tap into that channel and he would say that he was a good man had a good family had two or three little children he said but he got to hanging out with her own crowd started drinking started started playing cards on wednesday night and saturday and sunday night and he got to hanging with the wrong crowd and all of a sudden those demons started entering to him now you can pick the first devil whether you want to give over to cigarettes whether you want to get over to pornography or whether you want to give over to all types of sin you get to choose the first one but you don't get to choose the other seven that's coming behind it are you with me this morning demons are real and they're hunting down your life he was rolled off by the community he'd got in such a place that chains couldn't even hold him that he was a friend to the graveyard the only time i want to go to a graveyard is when i know the rapture's coming and my loved one's walking out of there i'm sick and tired of burying my friends but here legion was so cast off and put back in a corner where the community didn't want nothing to do with him and these demons gave him such power three to four times of his own human strength that he would break those chains and the prophet would say that he would he would start to come back to himself and he'd start making away and start thinking about his family saying i need to go back to my family i need to go back to my home i need to go back and all of a sudden those demons would come and they would tear him again and he'd cut himself with stones and every person that he would come in contact with in the community he would overcome them and he would he would hurt them and they would run for cover but not this time this was not just an ordinary man that was walking by by legion's way this was more than an ordinary man this was the son of god that was a reflection of heaven that would say that the man by the name of legion is worthy cause for the gospel of jesus christ i'd say that when those demons got to looking that they began to pull back and make jesus make jesus feel like he wasn't welcome there and it even pulled legion back they tried to pull him back in those tombs they tried to back pull him back into that fear now let me come to you those demons have tried to keep you from entering into this service and entering to what you are truly meant to do those demons are going to try to pull you back from where you're meant to be and where you're built to be at my brother branham said that legion would have never went out there those demons would have never went out there allowed legion to go out there unless jesus unless legion pushed past those demons how would you know jesus is on his way but you've got to push past your demons you've got to push past your chains there's a voice that is coming that's going to break those chains but you got to push past yourself you got to be willing to go to him now these demons that had so controlled legion they'd so controlled him in such a way that every person he'd come in contact with that he would overcome them and he'd whip them but when he looked at jesus he's seen something he'd never seen before oh i don't know what i'm going to do with him you see there was something on the inside of jesus that he would scream out how did that power get on the inside of that man oh church of the living god i'd say you've got every demon in hell running for cover this morning saying how did that power get inside of that body how did that anointing how did that pentecostal experience get on the inside of that human vessel he's more than enough he's more than enough he is more than enough for me [Music] how did you get in there i see a little boy he used to be a little boy he's a whole lot taller than me he come when he first come to church here he started interpreting but now god did a work in his life and you ought to hear him interpret he ain't no longer just interpreting he's interpreting with emphasis because it means something on the inside of him how did that power get on the inside of that man hallelujah how did that holy ghost get on the inside of brother ray how did that same holy ghost get on the inside of sister stephanie that she once walked one way but now she's walking a different way and if you're not walking why don't you start while i'm talking walking up the kings highway how did you get on the inside of brother doug hill when death come knocking at his door there was a voice that said come back brother doug come back to me brother doug [Applause] life wasn't giving up when death came knocking at his door there is power oh in the voice of jesus or there is power in the voice of jesus there is power in the bride of jesus to break everything to break every chain who's controlling who you remind your demons i put you under a blood you got to stay there he was willing to go to you how many knows what it's like to see jesus on his way maybe you weren't strung out on alcohol maybe you wasn't strung out on drugs maybe he wasn't strung out on pot if you're doing those things those are the attributes of sin but just because you didn't smoke or you didn't drink you are on your way well i never gambled i never did anything wrong you were born in sin i know a lot of a lot of christians have said even in this church today that never did anything that we would say morally wrong but they recognize that they were a sinner oh hallelujah i could tell you stories on top of stories about how people come out of drugs and how people come out of cardboard boxes that they were living on a street how they come out of this certain type of situation but i can also tell you about somebody that was living a morally correct life that was living and they were listening to this message but they still recognize when jesus was on his way and when he spoke other people had spoken but when he spoke sister julia you knew it was him hate that right sister gabrielle when he spoke he spoke when he moves he moves hallelujah turn with me turn me over to deuteronomy chapter 28. hallelujah why you turning there there's power and obeying his voice his voice spoke come out of him thou unclean spirit those demons had to obey that voice brother gabriel they had to because this voice had all power behind it i want you to while you're ready for that scripture i want you to i want you to catch this that even pigs will not even accommodate them devils pigs would not accommodate them devils you do not have to accommodate satan you do not have to accommodate his fear tactics you do not have to accommodate laodicea you need to hang a sign upon your door and say there's no vacancy this place is filled up i listened to a voice that set me on a different course no vacancy you do not have to put up with satan and his tactics in your life of trying to control your family and control your emotions and to control you with depression and anxiety and fear and lies and all types of things this voice has a blessing behind it deuteronomy 28 and verse one and it shall come to pass now notice this is what i want you to notice notice the blessings that come from obeying the voice and it shall come to pass that if thou shall hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee how many's obeyed the voice are you with me this morning keep your hand up how many has obeyed the voice all right and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee that if thou shall hearken unto the voice the lord of the lord thy god blessed shall thou be in the city and bless it shalt thou be in the field blessed shall thou shalt thou shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of that ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase the increase of thy kind and the and the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket in thy storm all this is coming from obeying his voice blessed shall thou be when thou comest in and blessed shall thou be when they'll goest down the lord shall call thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee on one way and flee before these seven ways all this is due to obeying his voice the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in thou thou in all that thou set us thy hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth the lord shall establish thee a holy people unto himself and he has sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways if you obey his voice all of these blessings will be yours but if you read from verse 15 on down the cursings that come from not obeying this voice are doubled by not obeying this voice i choose to stay on the top 15. i obey his voice that i'll be blessed when i come here and bless when i go out let him make me the head and not the tail he will put me above and not beneath obey his voice that's what you get there is power in you you ain't got no reason to fear you don't just hold a title in your hand you hold an abstract title that's been searched all the way back throughout sins life throughout all of it and it's been given to you that when a man once believes the word and the holy spirit comes behind it you have an abstract title deed that anything that was against your family has been struck off you ain't got nothing to be ashamed about you're a son of god a daughter of god fear has to listen to you not you listening to fear which fear are you accommodating a fear that you perish if so wake up jesus fear a covet wake up jesus fear of death wake up jesus or is it a godly fear that so puts the voice of god on the inside of you that the storms in your life have to listen to an ambassador of heaven this body must obey the voice now notice i'm getting ready to close you know sadia he said when you come to total obedience then you can have possession but until you totally obey you've got to completely surrender your own thoughts your own will your own mind and let the mind of christ operate in you now do you think that christ that do you think christ would with the mind of christ and you would say the days of miracles passed do you think the mind of christ in you would say the bible's right in some places and not in others the mind of christ would sanction every word that christ ever said it's right so if you don't use your own mind just use his his mind says and the church becomes a word when they let the word go through them his mind says you're sinless his mind says that the days of miracles are not past his mind says that you can have a baptism of the holy ghost his mind says you can have a sound mind and not the spirit of fear his mind says there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit his mind says they that are led by the spirit are the children of god his mind says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world his mind said if god be for me who can be against me hallelujah his mind has told me that their rock is not our rock the church world's rock is not our revelation but this revelation is his mind he's using human lips to speak to storms and say turn and go back where you came from and a storm that was coming down with a blizzard that it would have to stop who said that it was he it was he that spoke that it said i've given you power over this black mamba i've given you power over it you've got power to bind it and you've got power to loose it you can either have your joy or you can let loose your joy you can either have your peace or you can let go of your peace you can either have the holy ghost or not have it you got power to bind that thing his mind says you're washed his mind says you're redeemed his mind tells me that this body has got to obey its confession his mind tells me that he's the high priest of our confession that he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he said is there any sick among you let them call for the elders of the church his mind says rejoice always and rejoice even more he said in his word he said rejoice he said you have not because you ask not this body has to obey this voice you're going to hear it before you see it are you with me you're going to hear it before you see it you're going to hear it before you see it look at your neighbor say you're going to hear it before you see it when's growing up here on pilot mountain they still do it even today when he's growing up here on pilot mountain they they they would come across with those fighter jets and they would do their training right over right across pilot mountain and they would get so close they were trying to get solo and hover into those over those mountains and hang over the trees and they would come and man we'd hear them coming we'd hear them coming through when was in the house we was in there playing like a bunch of bulls in a china shop and we was running through there tearing everything up and we we'd hear them fighter jets coming and you could hear them before you ever seen them i always loved just running out of teeny's house running out there and just looking for it you heard it before

all he wanted to he tried everything within his power but he couldn't stop brother greg to come why because there was seed there was seed laying there and not only laying there but laying in the sun laying in his wife and he might begin to see those seeds of life as they begin to resurrect and satan tried to throw more dirt and more dirt and more dirt but he couldn't keep that seed from coming up because he didn't have enough [Applause] you've been trapped in all kinds of stuff but satan ain't got enough you can sit there in jealousy you can sit there in fear you can sit there in your torment or you can wake jesus up on the inside of you and say storm you ain't got enough cancer you ain't got enough tumors you ain't got enough this voice spoken a little fishy came back to life this voice spoke and storms were put out of existence before the doctor touches her tumors will be gone he's wanting to try to contaminate your spirit but before he touches you you're going to hear it before you
