[20:02] unspoken request like to lift up to the
[20:05] lord this morning
[20:06] we know god sees and meets all these
[20:08] requests that's brother gabriel spencer
[20:10] he would come and lead us to the throne
[20:12] of grace at this time
[20:14] [Music]
[20:20] time we draw our swords just as we heard
[20:22] last night
[20:23] it's time we curse every demon from hell
[20:25] that comes and conquers and tries to
[20:27] destroy each and every one of our lives
[20:29] you know as i think about our pastor
[20:31] he's coming out this morning fighting
[20:32] every every gun that's pointed against
[20:35] him every gun that's pointed against his
[20:37] life for all these many years
[20:40] that cancerous demon it raised its head
[20:42] and my dad and it did not conquer
[20:45] that cancerous demon raised his head in
[20:47] the lane of butts and it did not conquer
[20:49] him
[20:51] that cancerous demon raised his head and
[20:53] randy hinkle and it did not conquer him
[20:56] and we have a pastor that's standing
[20:58] here this morning and that demon will
[21:00] not conquer him because satan you can't
[21:03] have his life
[21:05] his life is god we're all children of
[21:07] god our life is his it is not satan's
[21:10] that comes and fights our
[21:12] our life
[21:13] i had a dream about a year ago and i
[21:15] told i told brother ron this just this
[21:17] week
[21:19] and i don't i don't know exactly what it
[21:20] means but
[21:22] i think back to the the sermon of
[21:24] identified for rapture and i know
[21:26] brother ron has identified for rapture
[21:29] as i had that dream i was standing right
[21:31] here
[21:32] i don't know i'll get i was praying
[21:35] and as i turned around i saw brother ron
[21:36] sitting right in this chair and he had
[21:38] red hair and he had a red mustache
[21:42] and i'd never seen him like that in this
[21:44] life
[21:45] i didn't know what he looked like i i'd
[21:46] never seen him with red hair and a red
[21:48] mustache and as i turned back this way a
[21:51] white cloud swept and hit me right in
[21:52] the face and i woke up from and it stuck
[21:54] with me to this day because every battle
[21:57] that that demon tries to conquer brother
[21:58] ron he stands up and he fights every day
[22:02] and every critic that's out there that
[22:03] tries to come against our pastor you
[22:05] just continue to watch as he raises up
[22:07] and as he raises up again
[22:09] go ahead and keep raising up against our
[22:11] pastor because we will stand here with
[22:13] our swords drawn to fight for him
[22:16] let's bow our heads in prayer
[22:18] [Music]
[22:20] gracious heavenly father as we come to
[22:22] you this morning
[22:24] we come to you humbly and we are just
[22:26] asking that we could just be more
[22:27] sincere with you
[22:29] we know what you told our pastor we know
[22:30] what you told the prophet as he came in
[22:32] this hour if we could just be more
[22:35] sincere if he could just be more sincere
[22:38] lord jesus you will use him like never
[22:39] before
[22:41] and lord jesus that wasn't just for our
[22:42] pastor but that was for us as a children
[22:45] of god
[22:46] and i just ask that you will just come
[22:47] and be with us this morning i ask that
[22:49] you will just allow us to move into that
[22:51] presence as you drop down into this
[22:53] service
[22:54] we invite you to come and be with us we
[22:56] invite you to come and anoint our pastor
[22:58] we uh allow it that you will just come
[23:01] and speak everything that we have in
[23:03] need of
[23:05] it seems as every week that demon raises
[23:07] his head and another child of god
[23:09] and that report from the doctor says
[23:11] that they have cancer and the end may be
[23:13] near they may have to go through
[23:15] different different
[23:17] medicines and medications and treatments
[23:19] but lord jesus we believe the report of
[23:21] the lord and your report says that they
[23:23] are healed
[23:24] and we just believe that you will just
[23:25] come down and send that comforter send
[23:27] that peace over top of their life
[23:29] because fear is from the devil and we
[23:31] will not take anything that comes from
[23:32] satan himself we will only take the word
[23:35] that comes from you lord and we just ask
[23:37] that you will just come down and you
[23:38] will just be with us be which with each
[23:40] and every prayer request no matter the
[23:42] mind battles no matter what may come we
[23:44] just ask that you will just be with us
[23:45] and continue to draw us closer to you
[23:47] this morning and that's in jesus
[23:49] christ's name we pray

[50:14] he loved us in spite of our mistakes
[50:18] he loved us in spite of our failures
[50:21] [Music]
[50:23] and you place something on the inside of
[50:25] us that reflected you
[50:29] it was a part of yourself
[50:33] lord and
[50:34] we didn't know it for a long time but
[50:37] we were staggering through life one day
[50:40] you touched our lives
[50:43] and from that day would never be the
[50:45] same

[51:18] you know how to take a broken
[51:20] heart a shattered future
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] you know how to take plans that have
[51:27] been destroyed

[51:32] you know how to take that which was so
[51:36] tainted by sin

[51:44] house
[51:45] [Music]
[51:46] come today lord
[51:48] you see our needs
[51:50] [Music]
[51:54] there's not a doctor that has the answer
[51:58] it's not a physician
[52:00] not a therapist
[52:01] but there's a mighty god that's in this
[52:03] building right now
[52:06] and you're that kind of god
[52:08] that specializes
[52:10] as brother branham would say he said now
[52:13] put that very difficult case at the
[52:15] front of the line
[52:18] oh god
[52:20] you're that same god today
[52:23] lord help us we pray
[52:25] as the word is read
[52:27] it's already anointed
[52:29] but now anoint us
[52:32] lord who knows how many services we have
[52:35] left in life
[52:37] the earth is coming to its end
[52:40] help us father
[52:42] strengthen us lord
[52:44] give us vision after last night what a
[52:47] phenomenal sermon
[52:49] lord that's way beyond the man's
[52:52] thinking
[52:53] come now and speak to our hearts in
[52:55] jesus name we pray
[52:57] amen and amen and amen and amen god
[53:00] bless you this morning we so love you
[53:02] with all of our hearts and
[53:04] amen
[53:05] trust you've had a good morning
[53:07] amen and i'll try to
[53:10] not take you too far into the afternoon
[53:12] but
[53:13] amen i believe the lord's come to
[53:14] minister to our needs and
[53:17] amen
[53:18] amen if you return with me to first
[53:20] corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24
[53:25] and if god will give me the strength
[53:27] today i'd like to speak to you about you
[53:30] amen
[53:32] the final runners
[53:37] the final runners
[53:39] amen
[53:42] now paul is going to be the first church
[53:44] age messenger
[53:46] and his message won't dissipate
[53:49] but it will carry through all seven
[53:51] church ages
[53:53] and it will be the standard bearer
[53:57] through the dark ages
[53:59] through the very difficult times it will
[54:01] be through people being burned at the
[54:04] stake
[54:05] their heads cut their their
[54:08] all different kind of things through the
[54:09] fox's book of martyrs
[54:12] there will be believers that will have
[54:14] to live in every age
[54:16] and we're not a bunch of quitters
[54:20] god anoints us from the throne and he
[54:22] releases revelations 1 he releases the
[54:25] messenger and then under that messenger
[54:28] they will be anointed to live and
[54:30] overcome
[54:33] are you with me so god knows exactly
[54:36] when you'll be born and exactly what
[54:38] message to send you to equip you for
[54:40] this day
[54:42] now watch how paul puts these things and
[54:45] i want you to just make this very
[54:46] personal to you
[54:49] first corinthians chapter 9 and verse 24
[54:53] know you not that they which run in a
[54:56] race
[54:57] run all
[54:59] but one receiveth the prize
[55:04] so run that ye
[55:06] may obtain
[55:08] and every man that strivet for the
[55:10] mastery is temporary in all things
[55:13] now they do it
[55:16] to obtain a corruptable crown
[55:20] but we
[55:21] an incorruptable
[55:23] notice he he just he
[55:26] very
[55:27] very decisively
[55:30] says there's two different worlds
[55:33] we're in this world but we're not of
[55:36] this world
[55:37] now notice now he's even talking about
[55:40] himself i therefore so run
[55:44] not as uncertainly
[55:46] so sophie'd i
[55:48] not as one that beateth the air
[55:52] but i keep
[55:54] under my body and bring it into
[55:57] subjection
[55:58] lest that by any means
[56:00] when i have preached to others
[56:03] i myself
[56:04] should be a castaway
[56:06] you may be seated today
[56:13] i don't know about you but there's been
[56:16] some things in my life that i looked so
[56:18] forward to events that were going to
[56:20] happen
[56:21] but after i got to the event
[56:25] it just didn't quite meet my expectation
[56:31] when i was in sin
[56:33] i i would go to concert
[56:35] [Music]
[56:36] and one particular time i i sat just
[56:39] just only just a few feet
[56:42] and
[56:43] from the
[56:44] from the one that was singing
[56:48] and
[56:51] you know it just didn't meet the
[56:52] expectation that i had
[56:55] that i thought it was
[56:58] maybe those in the sports world
[57:01] you you've had an opportunity to be a
[57:03] part of be very close to somebody that
[57:06] is a
[57:07] quite a quite an athlete
[57:09] but at the end of the day it just
[57:11] doesn't meet your expectation
[57:13] everybody's going to lose at some point
[57:17] but when we come to this message
[57:21] and we come to what is in god's mind and
[57:24] what god wants to do for us
[57:28] in a concert we were the spectator
[57:31] in the sports world we were a spectator
[57:34] but in when it comes to the message
[57:37] though you be sitting where you are
[57:39] you're not a spectator
[57:43] are you with me now
[57:46] now
[57:47] the word that we are preaching
[57:49] is seed and seeds have power in it
[57:53] and it's not the words of a man brother
[57:56] man will very quickly tell us you're not
[57:58] feeding on the mind of a man but you're
[58:00] feeding on the body word of the son of
[58:03] man
[58:04] you're not feeding on william branham
[58:06] and his personality or any preacher of
[58:09] the message and their personality you're
[58:12] feeding on the message itself
[58:14] and the end time message will bring end
[58:17] time results
[58:18] [Music]
[58:21] and this message will meet the challenge
[58:25] of the hour
[58:28] this message is not incapable
[58:32] we're not going to have to rewrite it or
[58:34] or amended or are actually kind of what
[58:37] you might say even embellish it the
[58:40] message that has the seed life of christ
[58:44] on the inside of it will perform
[58:49] it will change your body
[58:51] it has changed your nature it's changed
[58:54] your lifestyle
[58:56] you know that you know that you know you
[58:59] met him
[59:01] and since you met him you've never been
[59:04] the same
[59:06] amen
[59:08] i believe we're going to have church
[59:11] now brother rahm says he says now
[59:13] everybody can't be a preacher
[59:16] but you got a voice
[59:19] and if you can't preach people a sermon
[59:22] if you're a preacher you're called to
[59:23] the pulpit to preach
[59:25] and if you're not you're still a
[59:26] preacher
[59:28] but live the people a sermon
[59:31] let your sermon be so lived
[59:35] it's a voice of god that'll bring a
[59:37] reproach to them that reject it
[59:43] he said all right he said
[59:45] here was voices
[59:47] how we need in jeffersonville
[59:49] thousands of live voices
[59:54] the thunder of god thundering out the
[59:56] sweetness and holiness and purity
[59:59] undefiled lives walking around in the
[1:00:02] earth today that's what the message
[1:00:05] produces
[1:00:07] let me just say that's what the message
[1:00:09] produces is undefiled lives
[1:00:16] without a blemish
[1:00:19] he said real christians i like that real
[1:00:22] christians don't you
[1:00:24] i hate phony i hate artificial
[1:00:28] i hate put on
[1:00:30] i hate embellished i like real
[1:00:34] i like real men i like real women
[1:00:46] real christians
[1:00:47] that's the thunder against the devil
[1:00:51] the devil don't care how loud you can
[1:00:53] holler
[1:00:54] he don't care how much you can jump and
[1:00:56] how much you can do this or shout but
[1:00:59] what hurts the devil
[1:01:01] is to see that sanctified holy
[1:01:05] consecrated to god
[1:01:07] say anything to him call him anything
[1:01:10] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:01:13] right on that throws him away
[1:01:17] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[1:01:20] i think we ought to shake his kingdom
[1:01:25] [Applause]
[1:01:38] i thought i would just take a moment
[1:01:40] here
[1:01:42] we are all aware that i'm in a very
[1:01:44] difficult journey
[1:01:47] sometimes in journeys some journeys are
[1:01:51] are just a quick trial
[1:01:53] and some journeys are
[1:01:55] for the rest of your life or for a long
[1:01:58] time period
[1:02:00] and in some of those journeys
[1:02:02] we as humans we get weary
[1:02:06] we
[1:02:08] we begin to question things and we begin
[1:02:10] to do this or that
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:14] and we begin to to think has god
[1:02:16] forgotten me or
[1:02:18] and i'm saying this not just for myself
[1:02:22] trials that that begin to take on leaves
[1:02:25] of times
[1:02:27] great difficulties maybe many doctors
[1:02:30] lots of medicines involved
[1:02:32] still going to church still saying the
[1:02:35] same powerful quotes and same scriptures
[1:02:38] and and you're just hanging on you're
[1:02:40] just marching forward head down moving
[1:02:43] forward
[1:02:45] but god reminds us you're not alone in
[1:02:47] the fight
[1:02:49] and i want to say this to you as an
[1:02:51] audience and those in the internet
[1:02:53] you're not alone in your fight
[1:02:56] god puts around you men and women
[1:03:02] are you with me that they're there
[1:03:04] they're anointed to say the right things
[1:03:06] in the right moments
[1:03:09] to give you courage and give you
[1:03:11] strength
[1:03:12] [Music]
[1:03:14] anybody can quit
[1:03:17] anybody can say i've had enough
[1:03:20] but it takes something on the inside of
[1:03:22] you
[1:03:24] that grabs your bootstraps and you begin
[1:03:27] to move forward
[1:03:28] regardless of the circumstances
[1:03:34] i'll just mention a few names and i i'm
[1:03:37] not going to go far here but in my life
[1:03:42] there's a mike walls and a lloyd
[1:03:45] just out of the blue that just just
[1:03:48] write me just just really write me and
[1:03:50] they just drop me a word
[1:03:53] drop a word of strength and power
[1:03:57] just the right moment and when i hear it
[1:04:00] in their voices
[1:04:03] they're not just saying it to say it
[1:04:09] you know i've got friends like tim
[1:04:11] pruitt and donny reagan
[1:04:14] these are some of the most powerful
[1:04:16] generals
[1:04:17] that's on the earth
[1:04:20] and i could name a whole lot of other
[1:04:22] generals but these are men happen to be
[1:04:24] close friends and i've got a lot of
[1:04:26] close friends
[1:04:28] but they're men that have
[1:04:30] that have fought
[1:04:31] with the battle
[1:04:33] been there with me you've got friends
[1:04:35] like that
[1:04:37] don't and i'm using i am saying this and
[1:04:39] i'm stretching just a bit let me just
[1:04:42] say this you don't never let the devil
[1:04:44] tell you you're alone
[1:04:50] did you hear that sister short you're
[1:04:52] not alone
[1:04:55] whether you know it or not i was praying
[1:04:57] you'd be here
[1:05:01] and it's time for that battle to come to
[1:05:03] an end
[1:05:07] [Applause]
[1:05:18] well they're preachers
[1:05:20] there's a friend of mine named tim
[1:05:22] nunnwyler he'll watch this service this
[1:05:24] afternoon most likely
[1:05:26] he's in canada he's a trustee in a
[1:05:28] church there
[1:05:30] he sings
[1:05:32] he's a he's a wonderful man
[1:05:35] he came to a meeting
[1:05:37] recently drove
[1:05:39] many hours to the meeting
[1:05:41] and he said i know i probably won't be
[1:05:43] able to shake your hand or hug your neck
[1:05:45] and i saw him in the in the parking lot
[1:05:48] as i was leaving in the last service
[1:05:51] and they were ushering me into the car
[1:05:53] real quickly i said just a moment
[1:05:56] i got a friend here that's in the
[1:05:58] background
[1:05:59] he'll send me a note every week
[1:06:02] he'll send me a note that has power in
[1:06:04] it strength in it
[1:06:06] something just i've actually read some
[1:06:08] of these things and never called his
[1:06:10] name
[1:06:12] but listen that man has a ministry
[1:06:16] and he'll probably never preaching us in
[1:06:18] a pulpit
[1:06:20] are you with me now
[1:06:22] that's powerful
[1:06:26] jonas hildebrandt
[1:06:28] george quinn that writes me every week
[1:06:32] he's a general in ireland
[1:06:35] wrote me this i believe just this just a
[1:06:38] couple days ago
[1:06:40] and and has about 20 people in his
[1:06:43] church in that catholic nation and let
[1:06:45] me just say that's a mega church
[1:06:48] that's a mega church in ireland
[1:06:52] these are men and women
[1:06:55] that have found a way
[1:06:59] that on the other end of a phone
[1:07:03] whether by text or word by words and
[1:07:06] i've only picked out just a couple to
[1:07:08] use in this example i could spend two
[1:07:10] weeks here but i want you to understand
[1:07:13] and please nobody get offended but let
[1:07:15] me just say they have found a way
[1:07:18] a channel to release words that have
[1:07:21] power
[1:07:24] i want you to get it sometimes when you
[1:07:27] walk in service and you turn and shake
[1:07:29] somebody's hand and just say a sentence
[1:07:32] to them you do not know the trial that
[1:07:35] your neighbor has went through in a very
[1:07:37] secret way but your words may be more
[1:07:41] powerful than the entire sermon
[1:07:46] [Applause]
[1:07:53] if we could just live a life in a
[1:07:55] situation
[1:07:57] if we are the final runners every day
[1:08:01] matters
[1:08:03] every hour matters
[1:08:06] i'd like to just say this blue devil
[1:08:13] blue devil
[1:08:15] i'd like to remind him we
[1:08:17] are not alone
[1:08:22] now
[1:08:24] i i just want to just venture here just
[1:08:26] for a moment
[1:08:29] we have a very common enemy
[1:08:31] he's an enemy that god built
[1:08:35] as the antitype to light
[1:08:38] he is darkness god is lot
[1:08:41] he is hate
[1:08:43] god is love
[1:08:45] he is joy satan's depression
[1:08:51] god tells the truth and he is a liar
[1:08:56] and he's very good at his enemy as being
[1:08:58] an enemy
[1:09:00] god built him so
[1:09:02] and then he's building him so he would
[1:09:05] fight knowing he's losing
[1:09:13] he would fight to the bitter end
[1:09:15] believing i can overthrow the kingdom of
[1:09:17] god but the end of the book says he'll
[1:09:20] be cast into every darkness
[1:09:23] he'll be totally annihilated
[1:09:30] so satan can watch
[1:09:33] he can watch the lights and that
[1:09:35] dimension
[1:09:40] he can watch
[1:09:42] through time
[1:09:45] remember when he was standing with jesus
[1:09:47] and said if thou be the son of god
[1:09:53] i want to just say this to you
[1:09:56] satan also saw the stars
[1:10:00] line up
[1:10:04] he also heard the angels sing the first
[1:10:06] noel
[1:10:08] he also saw the angel of god
[1:10:11] come to a virgin
[1:10:14] so satan was a witness
[1:10:20] how can he tell you're a christian
[1:10:21] because the ambience of light
[1:10:24] that is around you
[1:10:27] young people whether you realize it or
[1:10:29] not your struggle you may not be able to
[1:10:31] understand your whole life but satan
[1:10:34] watches that realm of light that comes
[1:10:37] to you
[1:10:41] and he will fight you on a level that he
[1:10:43] can fight you with
[1:10:45] he'll fight you in your humanity he'll
[1:10:48] fight you in your mind he'll fight you
[1:10:51] in your physical struggle
[1:10:53] is it not any wonder
[1:10:56] that he's trying to fight myself and
[1:10:58] many others he don't have a lot of time
[1:11:01] to do to work
[1:11:02] and we have brought him much damage
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:20] the little girl called me the other day
[1:11:22] she's not just any little girl her name
[1:11:24] is ella
[1:11:27] ella was a girl that was born with a
[1:11:29] disease
[1:11:30] that would handicap her
[1:11:33] to crawl on the floor
[1:11:37] very almost animalistic
[1:11:41] doctors could give her no hope
[1:11:44] they've worked with her all of her life
[1:11:49] the last time i was there
[1:11:52] i got her to walk up to the platform
[1:11:54] with me
[1:11:55] and i felt very led to do that
[1:11:58] amen
[1:11:59] because satan has put every gun that he
[1:12:01] can put against her
[1:12:03] because he can see that light
[1:12:06] he can see that ambience of light that
[1:12:09] is around her and if you sit with much
[1:12:12] with her she can out quote most preacher
[1:12:14] she can quote more scriptures than than
[1:12:17] most anybody that i know and yet she has
[1:12:20] almost an angelic anointing with her
[1:12:23] yet with that disease that is so
[1:12:26] handicapped her body she called me the
[1:12:28] other day and and i was i was i was in
[1:12:32] my office
[1:12:33] and she said brother ron she said i just
[1:12:35] out of the blue had you on my heart and
[1:12:37] i thought i'm going to do more than just
[1:12:38] send a text i'm going to call
[1:12:45] she began to talk for a bit
[1:12:48] and i just i just said lord let her
[1:12:50] atmosphere
[1:12:52] just charge this office
[1:12:58] toward the end she said i'm getting
[1:12:59] ready to graduate
[1:13:01] in a few days
[1:13:05] they gave her no hope
[1:13:07] you'll never be nothing
[1:13:09] she called me here a few mo about a
[1:13:11] month ago and she said pray for me today
[1:13:14] brother ron she said i'm going to get my
[1:13:16] driver's license
[1:13:19] [Applause]
[1:13:29] don't tell me about your excuses
[1:13:33] gird up your loins and fight like you've
[1:13:35] never fought before
[1:13:41] she said no i said well what were we
[1:13:43] going to do with our life
[1:13:45] ella she said when i graduate she said
[1:13:48] i've already been accepted
[1:13:50] i'm going to be a lawyer
[1:13:58] i said ella i believe with all my heart
[1:14:00] you'll be one of the best lawyers that's
[1:14:02] ever been
[1:14:03] that stupid devil doesn't know what he's
[1:14:06] got to hold up
[1:14:07] i want to say that not just for ella but
[1:14:10] for you as believers
[1:14:12] that stupid devil doesn't know what he's
[1:14:14] got to hold up when he's got a hulk of a
[1:14:17] real genuine believer
[1:14:24] hallelujah
[1:14:27] [Applause]
[1:14:38] prophet said god's
[1:14:41] purpose
[1:14:43] can never be defeated
[1:14:48] roll your shoulders back
[1:14:51] and tell the enemy
[1:14:53] this is one sunday morning you're not
[1:14:56] going to rob my victory from men
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:01] when we realize what god has deposited
[1:15:04] what god has gathered
[1:15:09] you couldn't have been born in any other
[1:15:11] age
[1:15:13] god saved you for the very last
[1:15:16] listen any coach will have his best
[1:15:18] runner at the very end
[1:15:21] god's way above any coach or any olympic
[1:15:24] official he's got his final runner
[1:15:32] to run in this last layout of seeing age
[1:15:35] an age that's unfit to even live in but
[1:15:38] he's got a people
[1:15:40] that will not be distracted
[1:15:44] will not be deterred
[1:15:46] she is fortified by the word of god
[1:15:50] she's not going back
[1:15:56] we heard last night that
[1:15:58] we were in the vision
[1:16:01] let me just say the vision has become
[1:16:03] reality
[1:16:05] and now the real
[1:16:08] as long as it was vision you could you
[1:16:10] could do a lot of things with it
[1:16:13] you could just kind of say someday
[1:16:14] someday someday someday but the vision
[1:16:17] is now reality
[1:16:20] and now satan has the vision on his
[1:16:22] hands
[1:16:24] what was once in the vision of god's
[1:16:26] mind is now in human flesh
[1:16:30] born of his bone
[1:16:32] life of his life power of his power
[1:16:36] if he's hit on 16 silvers so will the
[1:16:39] bride
[1:16:40] the message is more than a picture but
[1:16:43] it's in human flesh
[1:16:47] [Applause]
[1:16:57] now god's strategy is to empty human
[1:17:00] vessels
[1:17:02] and shake the world with them
[1:17:08] what world will you shake
[1:17:11] the one you work with
[1:17:15] the community that you live in
[1:17:18] and you may not even have to open your
[1:17:20] mouth
[1:17:26] the power
[1:17:28] of your life
[1:17:31] the power
[1:17:32] of your atmosphere
[1:17:36] the power of the anointing that is upon
[1:17:40] you
[1:17:41] you didn't give that to yourself
[1:17:44] you didn't go looking for that but god
[1:17:47] came looking for you
[1:17:52] and he knew the kind of trouble that you
[1:17:55] would be in
[1:17:57] and that did not frustrate him
[1:18:01] woman at the well
[1:18:06] the woman at the well do you think god
[1:18:09] didn't know she had five husbands that
[1:18:10] one she living with was not her husband
[1:18:13] but she was going to be one of the
[1:18:14] greatest witnesses
[1:18:18] witness of grace witness of mercy
[1:18:21] witness of what god can take with his
[1:18:23] creative word and speak to her
[1:18:27] a woman that was a harlot
[1:18:30] a woman that had been scarred a woman
[1:18:33] that had many many many past stories in
[1:18:36] her life and tons of excuses
[1:18:40] that was the woman that god chose
[1:18:43] to be a witness
[1:18:49] so don't tell me about your excuses
[1:18:54] [Music]
[1:19:03] brother ron but us as women
[1:19:06] we have such a handicap
[1:19:09] really
[1:19:11] really
[1:19:13] first of all
[1:19:15] it has been scientifically proved
[1:19:18] that in the feminine gender she thinks
[1:19:21] much faster than a man
[1:19:28] you men ought to amend all over this
[1:19:30] building
[1:19:33] roll your shoulders back
[1:19:35] you can think how great you are but
[1:19:37] you've never won an argument
[1:19:55] don't be mad at me brothers you know
[1:19:56] it's a truth
[1:19:59] only reason you did she let you
[1:20:04] can remember things that was done on a
[1:20:06] tuesday of 1982
[1:20:08] in the afternoon at four o'clock
[1:20:23] that's right brother bill
[1:20:35] brother ron why would you go there
[1:20:37] then what did god
[1:20:40] deposit
[1:20:42] in the feminist part of himself
[1:20:49] satan you thought i was going to get
[1:20:50] something stirred i am
[1:20:54] that's why this bride thinks on a
[1:20:56] different level
[1:21:06] because god deposited that on the inside
[1:21:10] of her
[1:21:11] and she does take the word of god
[1:21:14] and she knows what she wants done with
[1:21:17] it and she does that word
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:28] it is no wonder you tongue tie the devil
[1:21:31] and he runs back like a little scared
[1:21:33] puppy dog
[1:21:34] back into hell
[1:21:36] because you whip him day after day after
[1:21:39] day after day
[1:21:44] [Applause]
[1:21:51] brother graham said i'm so glad that a
[1:21:52] man can so completely serve god
[1:21:56] tell the devil don't know what to do
[1:21:58] with him
[1:22:01] i want a scripture okay
[1:22:03] he giveth power to the faint
[1:22:07] and to them that have no might
[1:22:10] he
[1:22:11] increaseth strength
[1:22:18] i want to see a miracle today brother
[1:22:19] ron
[1:22:20] you're watching one
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:36] even the youth will fail
[1:22:38] and be weary
[1:22:40] young men shall literally fall
[1:22:42] but they that wait upon the lord
[1:22:49] but they that wait upon the lord don't
[1:22:51] get ahead of god
[1:22:53] don't try to write the book before god
[1:22:56] writes it
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:23:10] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:23:12] their strength
[1:23:15] they shall mount up with wings as an
[1:23:17] eagle
[1:23:19] they shall run
[1:23:22] not be weary
[1:23:24] they shall walk and nothing
[1:23:28] i want to remind you of with scripture
[1:23:31] no weapon that is formed against thee
[1:23:34] shall prosper
[1:23:37] and every tongue that riseth against
[1:23:39] thee in the judgment
[1:23:41] thou
[1:23:42] shalt condemn
[1:23:46] stay with me here so the enemy torment
[1:23:50] take his name
[1:23:56] just take his name
[1:23:58] just take his name down
[1:24:02] can i have your name
[1:24:03] what do you need with my name i'm a
[1:24:05] demon
[1:24:06] i'm going to use it against you
[1:24:08] oh yeah
[1:24:10] there's going to be a day where i'm
[1:24:12] standing
[1:24:14] with god in judgment and i'm going to
[1:24:16] call your name
[1:24:18] because you tormented me
[1:24:20] and god's going to pour his wrath out on
[1:24:23] you
[1:24:24] now i may not be able to destroy you
[1:24:26] today but there's coming a day mr cancer
[1:24:30] there's coming a day
[1:24:33] there's coming a day
[1:24:36] where you're going to regret
[1:24:38] ever me coming into my life

[1:25:23] regret that
[1:25:25] was on your way to church and was in an
[1:25:27] accident satan's going to regret that
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:33] just because they're your bosses
[1:25:37] are you with me that don't make them
[1:25:38] lords over top of you
[1:25:41] they're going to regret that
[1:25:46] you may be married to an abuser you
[1:25:48] don't have to stay with them
[1:25:50] satan's going to regret that
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:26:11] maybe i meant
[1:26:16] revelations 5 and verse 9
[1:26:20] i beheld and lo in the midst of the
[1:26:22] throne and the four beasts
[1:26:24] and the best of the elders stood a lamb
[1:26:28] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:26:31] and seven eyes which are the seven
[1:26:32] spirits of god that went forth into the
[1:26:35] all the earth
[1:26:37] and he came and he took the book out of
[1:26:39] the right hand of him that set up on the
[1:26:41] throne
[1:26:42] and when he had taken the book
[1:26:44] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[1:26:46] elders fell down before the lamb
[1:26:49] having every one of them
[1:26:51] hearts and golden vials full of odors
[1:26:56] which are the prayers of the saints
[1:27:01] god don't forget your prayers
[1:27:05] satan if you're fighting your people
[1:27:07] which i know you are i want you this is
[1:27:09] your scripture
[1:27:11] our prayers are not
[1:27:15] forgotten amen
[1:27:27] what place was that
[1:27:29] okay
[1:27:33] now this is our part
[1:27:36] and they sung a new song
[1:27:40] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[1:27:42] and to loose the
[1:27:44] and to open the seals thereof
[1:27:46] for thou was slain
[1:27:48] and that's redeemed us to god by the
[1:27:51] blood out of every kindred
[1:27:53] tongue
[1:27:54] people and nation
[1:27:57] we're that
[1:27:58] scripture our new song is

[1:28:25] are you with me they want to take the
[1:28:26] deity of jesus christ
[1:28:28] out of it
[1:28:30] they want to take the emotion out of it
[1:28:33] are you with me but when i think about
[1:28:36] what god did for me
[1:28:38] it causes me to be emotional
[1:28:43] and they sung my new song
[1:28:49] the preacher walked down the stairs and
[1:28:51] walked out in the streets he said do you
[1:28:53] know grace
[1:28:54] [Music]

[1:36:59] god having provided some better thing
[1:37:02] for us
[1:37:03] that they without us cannot be made
[1:37:07] perfect
[1:37:15] what a responsibility that puts on us
[1:37:19] let's just stop just for a moment
[1:37:22] of all the expectation
[1:37:26] that god has for us at this time
[1:37:34] somebody's got to finish
[1:37:41] somebody's got to be the final runner
[1:37:44] that means a final representative
[1:37:54] putin's making all his nonsense
[1:37:57] and he don't realize
[1:37:59] there's angels standing there
[1:38:02] let's just say it how it is
[1:38:05] even in our oval office
[1:38:07] they can't do nothing
[1:38:10] they are handicapped
[1:38:14] they are handicapped because angels of
[1:38:18] god
[1:38:19] are standing there keeping them
[1:38:23] from destroying the world
[1:38:27] because we're here
[1:38:37] you read it in your newspaper
[1:38:39] you read it
[1:38:41] of all of the travesties in people's
[1:38:43] lives innocent people
[1:38:45] and just tragedies get a hold of them
[1:38:48] why didn't that happen to you
[1:38:54] let's just stop and be thankful here
[1:38:55] just for a moment because there's many
[1:38:57] times we walk into church and we go god
[1:38:59] do something for me and he's had angels
[1:39:02] dispatch at your house
[1:39:06] and maybe somebody would like to rob
[1:39:08] houses today and they come by your house
[1:39:11] and an angel told them not here
[1:39:14] that's better than having a watchdog
[1:39:21] not here
[1:39:22] you go on somewhere else
[1:39:28] maybe a fire would have started and all
[1:39:31] of a sudden an angel puts it out
[1:39:44] so many times we we thank god for what
[1:39:47] god saved us from
[1:39:51] we look back in our lives and i so
[1:39:53] appreciated that brother andrew
[1:39:55] from a vision
[1:39:57] how many people's lives have been
[1:39:58] affected from that vision
[1:40:10] last year
[1:40:12] we preached a message here
[1:40:14] on a sunday morning like this
[1:40:17] and we were sending it to to edmonton
[1:40:22] and they were they were streaming at the
[1:40:24] same time
[1:40:25] live
[1:40:28] there's a sister named terry
[1:40:32] and she's
[1:40:33] about my age maybe a bit younger you can
[1:40:36] thank me later
[1:40:40] and
[1:40:41] terry is a musician in the church he's
[1:40:44] never been married
[1:40:45] she's a musician in the church there
[1:40:49] and she was a folk
[1:40:50] singer
[1:40:53] and a preacher named don babis
[1:40:56] came into her life
[1:40:58] and began to witness the message to her
[1:41:01] her family
[1:41:03] literally wanted to destroy her
[1:41:06] because she throwed away her career
[1:41:12] and they thought she just went off on
[1:41:13] the deal
[1:41:14] and she's
[1:41:16] you know being a single woman she's
[1:41:18] she's lived a very lonely life in a lot
[1:41:20] of times
[1:41:22] and she said that she was sitting on a
[1:41:25] park bench
[1:41:27] kind of
[1:41:28] going through her life thinking about
[1:41:30] the what could have beens and the
[1:41:32] what-ifs and kind of feeling sorry for
[1:41:34] herself and she comes on that sunday
[1:41:36] morning
[1:41:37] and god drops in that service 2500 miles
[1:41:40] away
[1:41:42] and goes to a park bench
[1:41:48] and reads what's going on in that life
[1:41:51] and she gets it
[1:41:56] you tell me god's not mindful of you
[1:42:22] i'm going to say something that's going
[1:42:23] to be way at the left field
[1:42:25] but i'm going to say it
[1:42:27] because somebody way higher than me said
[1:42:29] it
[1:42:35] david
[1:42:37] you've been through a lot of difficult
[1:42:39] things in your life
[1:42:44] and you my sister
[1:42:46] have been crushed in a lot of ways
[1:42:49] but you see god loved david so much to
[1:42:52] get him here he had to send you through
[1:42:54] those things to get him here
[1:43:06] brother honor
[1:43:07] are you out of your mind
[1:43:09] that's how personal god is
[1:43:13] that's how much he loves you
[1:43:17] that's how much he loves you
[1:43:22] that's how much he loves your mother
[1:43:31] when he starts collecting final
[1:43:37] can runners
[1:43:38] have some liberty here i guess i do
[1:43:42] god don't necessarily pick up hollywood
[1:43:44] actors
[1:43:46] so one of these most powerful generals
[1:43:48] is born with a debilitating disease to
[1:43:52] where he walks on his ankles
[1:43:59] did that stop him
[1:44:06] for joe green born with a debilitating
[1:44:09] disease
[1:44:12] did that stop god
[1:44:17] let me just keep coming whitney born
[1:44:21] with a wound the way that it was born
[1:44:24] and davey marries her knowing i can't
[1:44:26] have children with her but i love her so
[1:44:29] much
[1:44:32] but god has a plan
[1:44:38] but brother ron i've been sent through
[1:44:40] some horrible storms
[1:44:42] he's walking with you
[1:44:44] in the storm
[1:45:02] how did i get here
[1:45:04] you didn't come here on your own
[1:45:08] god guided you here
[1:45:11] and sometimes in the guiding
[1:45:14] he's put some storms
[1:45:16] in there right
[1:45:19] in there right
[1:45:20] it's put some really bad storms in life
[1:45:23] there's some really rough days there's
[1:45:25] been some really ring in the hands
[1:45:27] it's been has god forgot me and he's
[1:45:30] sitting here on the sunday morning and
[1:45:32] said i brought you through all of that
[1:45:37] and if we could trust god to get us
[1:45:40] through all of that he can get us there
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:46:05] hebrews chapter 12 in verse 1
[1:46:09] we're foresee and we're compassed about
[1:46:13] was so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:46:16] for a moment
[1:46:18] i'd like you to think about who's
[1:46:20] standing watching you
[1:46:26] they're better than a super bowl
[1:46:28] audience
[1:46:32] they're better than an olympic
[1:46:34] experience
[1:46:38] they're not just watching
[1:46:40] they're encouraging
[1:46:43] i've come full circle
[1:46:45] and you heard me mention men like tim
[1:46:48] nunnweiler you never heard his name
[1:46:49] before you heard me mention others
[1:46:52] ella word of encouragement can you
[1:46:56] imagine from another realm
[1:47:00] those that have overcome
[1:47:02] and they're standing there
[1:47:06] and they're watching you
[1:47:10] and encouraging you
[1:47:15] and strengthening you
[1:47:18] and the devil was telling you you were
[1:47:20] alone
[1:47:25] can i give you insight
[1:47:28] there's thousands of angels
[1:47:33] and the strong angel himself is here
[1:47:37] to make sure that this bride
[1:47:41] and this word
[1:47:46] does what it says it'll do
[1:47:51] i'm gonna say something very carnal here
[1:47:52] just for a moment in a business there's
[1:47:55] nobody that will do the business like
[1:47:57] the owner
[1:48:01] you can go to mcdonald's
[1:48:03] you can go wherever
[1:48:05] and you can always tell who's the owner
[1:48:07] of the shop
[1:48:14] the owner the constructor
[1:48:16] the owner of the suit shop the owner of
[1:48:18] the shoe shop the owner goes the extra
[1:48:22] mile
[1:48:27] so god's not just sent some ordinary
[1:48:30] angel
[1:48:33] but he himself has come down
[1:48:36] god himself
[1:48:39] to accomplish
[1:48:41] what he should do
[1:48:58] it's pretty staggering isn't it yeah
[1:49:00] that's first down
[1:49:05] i'm not gonna ask who's run one
[1:49:08] but who knows what a marathon's out like
[1:49:11] marathon
[1:49:13] marathon is what 20
[1:49:15] help me here
[1:49:20] cassie what in the world
[1:49:24] 26 miles
[1:49:27] 26 miles is what a marathon is
[1:49:30] now marathon's not for the faint of
[1:49:32] heart it's not for sprinters
[1:49:35] sprinters they build their self up
[1:49:38] they strengthen themselves they they use
[1:49:41] all the right
[1:49:43] training
[1:49:44] to do the quick step
[1:49:45] i never was there
[1:49:51] i was never that
[1:49:55] but the guy that's in a marathon knows
[1:49:58] i gotta get myself a shake
[1:50:01] 26 miles is 26 miles
[1:50:05] and so a guy that's really a marathoner
[1:50:08] and i'm talking about the real deal
[1:50:11] he's going to do a whole lot more than
[1:50:12] 26 miles in a day if he's anticipating
[1:50:14] winning
[1:50:18] now in a marathon there's a lot of stars
[1:50:21] come out
[1:50:22] i'm gonna run a marathon today
[1:50:26] i'm gonna run the boston marathon today
[1:50:29] they get the best
[1:50:32] they get the number
[1:50:33] they get their pictures taken
[1:50:36] this is for you brother david mayor
[1:50:44] they wave at everybody and they go
[1:50:46] look who's running in the marathon today
[1:50:49] so and so he's running in the marathon
[1:50:51] today
[1:50:52] he ain't gonna run far
[1:50:56] he's gonna use more energy on that wave
[1:50:59] than he is on his feet
[1:51:04] nobody goes before the whistle
[1:51:09] and then they have a starting gun
[1:51:12] they should learn to use those in
[1:51:14] hollywood
[1:51:23] and they
[1:51:25] they shoot
[1:51:27] and everybody takes off
[1:51:32] and they start running
[1:51:34] well you know there's a lot of people
[1:51:36] hanging on that first first little bit
[1:51:41] they've been doing that in their living
[1:51:42] room
[1:51:44] this thing they seem so bad
[1:51:47] all sudden water starts coming down
[1:51:49] their eyes they ain't seen that before
[1:52:00] and they go by and they need a gallon of
[1:52:02] water instead of a cup
[1:52:07] is that all i get
[1:52:10] and their ankle starts hurting and their
[1:52:12] shin starts hurting and their knees
[1:52:14] start hurting backstarter
[1:52:19] you know ain't no need to be torturing
[1:52:20] myself
[1:52:22] i'm done see y'all
[1:52:25] have a good run see y'all that's what
[1:52:27] happens in church
[1:52:31] a lot of people have stood and waved at
[1:52:33] the audience
[1:52:34] i'm here
[1:52:36] i'm here well sit down baby
[1:52:40] go ahead and take your seat we ain't
[1:52:42] taking your picture
[1:52:47] this is going to be more than a little
[1:52:49] sprint
[1:52:52] this is for life
[1:52:55] [Applause]
[1:53:04] you know the other day
[1:53:05] there was a marathon went on
[1:53:08] in louisiana
[1:53:13] and this little fella
[1:53:16] was never supposed to walk
[1:53:20] he was born with a defect in his hip
[1:53:24] and he was never supposed to walk
[1:53:28] but so happened god had a different plan
[1:53:33] i got the video on my phone i could show
[1:53:35] it to you
[1:53:36] but little drew
[1:53:40] was running
[1:53:42] and the doctor was on the other side
[1:53:44] watching and here comes the miracle
[1:53:51] he wasn't setting no records
[1:53:54] but he was running
[1:53:57] you don't have to set records here
[1:54:00] but you're ironic
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:23] i got a whole lot more material but i
[1:54:25] want to finish here if you just give me
[1:54:26] just a just a few more seconds
[1:54:32] now i might if i could just share
[1:54:34] anything with you
[1:54:36] this morning
[1:54:40] and i can be an encouragement to you no
[1:54:42] matter what you're going through
[1:54:44] and i mean no matter what you're going
[1:54:46] through
[1:54:48] is yesterday was probably one of the
[1:54:49] sickest days of my life
[1:54:54] i don't need no pity party
[1:54:56] i don't need nobody to hold my hair back
[1:55:04] but these boys have been really good to
[1:55:06] keep me the sickness
[1:55:08] from being in the public
[1:55:14] but there was just no way i could be in
[1:55:16] service last night just no way
[1:55:20] so when i woke up at a quarter to six
[1:55:22] this morning
[1:55:25] the booger was standing at the bed
[1:55:28] and he said boy you feel too bad
[1:55:31] you feel way too bad
[1:55:35] so i just throw my feet right out on the
[1:55:37] floor
[1:55:39] and i sit there
[1:55:41] same blurry vision
[1:55:43] same
[1:55:44] headache i said hmm
[1:55:47] i believe i'll take a walk
[1:55:49] i walk every morning on the treadmill
[1:55:52] no matter how bad i feel how good i feel
[1:55:55] no matter if i have to stop it
[1:55:57] and just i'll just tell you no matter if
[1:55:59] i have to stop it and go throw up
[1:56:02] get cleaned up i get right back on that
[1:56:03] treadmill

[1:56:07] you're the only one fighting this fight
[1:56:09] i just get right back on the treadmill
[1:56:11] because i've always got a sermon going
[1:56:15] and there's something in that sermon
[1:56:16] that's going to speak to my heart so i
[1:56:18] get right back on the treadmill and i
[1:56:19] get my two bottles of water

[1:57:01] and that's what you got to do sometimes
[1:57:02] when you come to church
[1:57:06] sometimes you may not feel like
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:10] you might not feel the part
[1:57:12] but god called you
[1:57:14] and he put something on the inside of
[1:57:16] you that got your feet up on the floor
[1:57:20] and you shook your head
[1:57:23] and your hair was a mess
[1:57:25] and your breath smells like a dinosaur
[1:57:27] died there last night
[1:57:29] but you get yourself up
[1:57:32] and you get on your spiritual treadmill
[1:57:35] and said if god called me to walk i'm
[1:57:37] going to walk if they call me to run i'm
[1:57:40] on a run if they call me to dance i'm
[1:57:42] going to dance
[1:57:46] i'm going to move forward

[1:58:50] of them
[1:58:56] what about my friends what about your
[1:58:57] friends
[1:58:59] what about my difficulties what about
[1:59:01] your difficulties what about the things

[1:59:23] well i'm gonna need another example you
[1:59:24] can stay standing and musicians couldn't
[1:59:26] come
[1:59:30] brother branham said he could see his
[1:59:32] end out there at 56.
[1:59:38] as a prophet he could see things that we
[1:59:40] can't see
[1:59:42] and he knew he was coming to an end
[1:59:46] did that make him quit
[1:59:49] when he was speaking in
[1:59:51] shreveport for his last time
[1:59:54] he makes a statement
[1:59:56] in the opening
[1:59:58] service
[2:00:00] he couldn't go on a certain hunt
[2:00:04] that hunt was with brother biscuit he
[2:00:06] just had canceled that hunt with brother
[2:00:07] biscuit because he wanted to do more for
[2:00:09] the lord
[2:00:10] that's what he said
[2:00:13] and he said
[2:00:15] said there's
[2:00:16] brother here that wasn't here
[2:00:19] isn't here this year that was here last
[2:00:20] year
[2:00:21] and he said i may not be here next year
[2:00:24] what he was saying was absolutely right
[2:00:27] i may not be here next year
[2:00:29] and he was saying that
[2:00:31] to the audience i may not be here next
[2:00:33] year
[2:00:34] did that make him deter
[2:00:37] he preaches some of the most powerful
[2:00:38] sermons ever preached by a preacher
[2:00:41] standing in a pulpit
[2:00:44] and he delivers his heart
[2:00:47] then he will make a couple different
[2:00:48] trips
[2:00:49] and he'll speak some sermons one being
[2:00:51] leadership
[2:00:53] and you can hear him talk about and in
[2:00:55] that sermon he talks about the rich
[2:00:57] young ruler that he came so close
[2:01:01] i want to say this in my
[2:01:03] final statements to you as an audience
[2:01:05] this afternoon
[2:01:07] i don't want to come so close
[2:01:09] and miss it
[2:01:15] i don't want to spend so much energy and
[2:01:17] come to the end
[2:01:20] and a little hiccup
[2:01:25] it's not a job there's not a woman
[2:01:27] there's not a
[2:01:28] bank account worth
[2:01:30] a hiccup
[2:01:38] brother vernon just
[2:01:40] you related something to me the other
[2:01:41] day and it stuck with me stuck with me
[2:01:44] thick
[2:01:46] i i left i left and brother vernon said
[2:01:50] you remember brother homer would make a
[2:01:52] statement said he made some strong
[2:01:53] statements that were hard and said
[2:01:55] sometimes i kind of
[2:01:56] i kind of wish he wouldn't talk so hard
[2:01:58] but he said he would tell it
[2:02:00] he said he said you have got something
[2:02:02] in your life that you're putting ahead
[2:02:05] of god
[2:02:06] he said
[2:02:07] god
[2:02:08] got to take that right out of your
[2:02:10] he'll take that right out of your life
[2:02:23] if you put god first in your life
