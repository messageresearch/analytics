close so amen amen i love you that's that's i'm a fan favorite so amen amen god bless you amen like to thank you again for the cleanup and we are in great preparation we want to be praying for brother donnie brother tim and brother timothy that god would just anoint the word in such a way to touch our lives all the people that will come we want to be just ready sister connie had a little tea party yesterday and on and on friday night i said at the end of the table and she took a picture of that everything was placed just in order she said what you doing i said i'm sitting here studying with you i just wanted to come close to you and so i'm sitting studying and i'm sitting at the end of the table and i'm just writing some things down and and she said in every place everything's just got to be right and i thought of how the lord [Music] he's making he's making preparations for a table [Music] anna he has a special spot for us and everything's just gonna be right it's just gonna be right so go to prayer just before service our friend brother kelly hildebrand has pneumonia and he's trying to preach this morning we pray that god would just touch him brother roger and sister ann are in a very difficult time with their and their family it's all in god's hands god's time in god's season i want to lift him in prayer this morning brother andrew wow what a sermon last night i felt sorry for the guy following him today and so and so i want to pray that god would anoint him and brother and brother timothy next week these meanings are crucial because now we're just right at the end of the end we're at the end of the end of the end the gentile dispensation all that gentiles will go on but god will move from gentiles to jews [Music] and so we want to see those get saved before he makes that move amen so let's pray for all of these things today maybe you'd like to say brother would you remember me father thank you that you're a god that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities you would take the time to sit at a well and wait on a woman you would go to a house to wear that but you knew that you wouldn't be welcome but because of one woman that would come and wash your feet now lord this house is a house that that you're welcome this building is full of believers that love your message we believe it you're welcome here we feel your presence brother kelly we ask you that you touch his body today may you bring him strength or dry out those nodules drop that pneumonia today bring him straight today ask you to touch his body he has a very rigorous agenda just in front of me i pray that you'd give him strength for that father now lord jesus you see our needs today our hands have went up god you specialize in impossibilities [Music] this week i will sit before some of the best doctors that there is and they will give me what their thoughts are but god you're the high physician today today you're not just a practicing physician but you're a perfecting one you're the one that made our bodies so you know how to heal them now i ask you today that you would anoint my flesh my spirit in my soul like never before and lord may if there's any gift that we have both the speaker and his hearer is to get ourselves out of the way we ask you that the angel of the lord would just take full control of this building now in jesus name we pray amen and amen amen god bless you god bless you so much amen matthew chapter 6 and verse 9 and then matthew chapter 5 and verse 2. i'd like to just speak to you today on orchestrated lives for orchestrated place matthew chapter 6 and verse 9. and jesus is just in a few words is going to teach us about prayer and after this manner pray therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name we could spend months on that sentence thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so may we reflect our citizenship of another world give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen you can be seated jesus in this prayer was speaking of two worlds citizens of this world and citizens of another world and he was telling us that he would provide for us our daily bread we don't know what tomorrow's struggle is but he does so he knows how to give us words of eternal life that will give us strength for the coming battles the debts that he's talking about is not necessarily the finances in your mailbox but he's talking about sins that you're that you have had in your past life that you have dealt with the difficulty of your mind battles that you deal with on a daily basis not only are you dealing with them but others are dealing with them as well then he tells us that lead us not into temptation and if you remember we have angels that are about us that are watching over us that we are better protected than the president of the united states of america satan would destroy us all if he could and he would do it in a moment's notice sometimes you're thinking about you're having a difficult day and your day is being destroyed you would just read the paper innocent people are killed in malls and in parking lots on the highway and you think well why didn't it happen to me let me just say at that moment you need to think that god has angels that are watching over you jesus is going to preach no doubt one of his first sermons and you would think that the one that created the worlds let me just say this to you the son that comes up in the morning our god created that our god created that the super moon that we saw on thursday night our god created that he created a light for our universe to which that it would burn so hot that it would light the entire universe and it would be so bright till the furthest star would reflect itself because the further star has no resonance in itself to have light but it reflects the sun which is even billions of miles away from it god created that sun and he created it such that it would never go out [Music] man can't even create a light bulb can do that when we think about how that god laid the zodiac out everyone in its perfect order had to clinker as the prophet stood in the pulpit and began to tell us of not darwin's theory but begin to tell us about how that god created the heavens and the earth that was more than a kentuckian's idea and we'll get to some of that when enoch writes when he looks at the heavens and then he builds a pyramid he does it absolutely into perfection even now that we we don't understand the mystery of how all the lines that the pyramid mid is perfect it is perfect it lays on the the very very center of the earth every every even every corner is exactly right everything is exactly right because god was writing his first bible 40 different writers would write your bible every one of them had to lay aside their own personality to write the word of god are you with me every one of them had to get beside their own personality so that they could show god and write it down not for a temporary uh generation but it's going to be throughout all throughout all eternity no time period to it it's going to be through eternity each one would be inspired by the same same author the god of the bible the god that wrote that role the son into existence the god that put the pyramid that god would come to moses now that god is going to stand in humanity you know and not necessarily a hollywood by a body a man maybe a less than 150 pounds a slender man rugged looking man not a body to wear that anyone would feel extremely well that's a great handsome man it's not a statesman sort of a man he's a he's actually he's actually came in such a veiled body until nobody will pay attention to his body but that was god it was god in a manger it was god being in egypt for two years it was god confounding those those wisest men of the earth that was god veiled in that humanity brother brown said if he wasn't god he was the greatest deceiver that the world's ever had [Music] are you with me now let me just touch this just for a moment the woman that had a blood issue had been to every doctor but she said if i can only touch the hem of his garment i know i'll be well because that was god jesus's friend lazarus was in a tomb no other are you with me now no other man had been raised in disorder nobody had walked to a tomb after corruption had set in but he was going to prove that i am the resurrection and i am the life a lot of people say a lot of things but they can't back it up [Applause] notice what he says blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven remember how brother branham before he preaches his seals he preaches god hid and revealed in simplicity blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god now remember he's operating in two worlds he's standing preaching to thousands and he knows there's some seed there that's going to spend eternity with him brother jim you send us a picture every morning don't you ever quit one of these days is where it's going to be so remade it's so beautiful this earth's beauty he created it in such a way and jesus is thinking not only about the natural realm but he's thinking about that eternal realm you remember in in 1st thessalonians 4 he talks about rapture but before he talks about rapture he talks about the conduct of people the early part of first thessalonians 4 of the character of people that's going to live there because remember in that realm there's no sin you deal with it at mcdonald's you deal with it definitely at walmart i'm sorry charles i don't know how you work there but we're going to a place where there's no sin nobody thinks an evil thought this is not even involved it's you know there's no there's never going to be adultery there there's never going to be a lie ever told there there's never going to be a war there not a death there's not going to be a leaf fall off of the tree there we can't imagine it but he's going to have a people that have been so orchestrated in their lives that they can live in that kind of continuous condition hallelujah [Music] this is a powerful scripture blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god blessed are they which are persecuted for for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted the prophets before you now i want you to honor this you're the salt of the earth you're the preserver are you with me wherever you are wherever you're watching this you are preserving your community your prayers of this day as evil as this day is your prayers are preserving where you're at but one day you won't be here you're the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost it save though wherewith shall it be salted it stents forth good for nothing but it's cast out and to be trodden under the foot of men year the light of the world a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick but it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and not glorify you but glorify the father which is in heaven we are reflecting him now if we can just think about this there's no way we can comprehend the mind of god in all of his pre-planning and brother george quinn took me by a house and pointed me to a man that had spent 40 years 40 years studying a cockroach he spent his entire working life studying a cockroach that you and i do not want in our house and god said let there be from the smallest ant to the biggest animal nothing let's just go another step if we can there was a man with nasa and they sent they sent an instrument into the heavens and he had watched that for 40 years and now he's retiring he'd watched it every day the pictures had came back every day of what that instrument was taking pictures of and god created all of that and that man and he actually studies those pictures every day he was just literally studying what god created whether it's mountains or the deepest of the sea god created it but let me just say god had you in his mind and you're the highest of any specie you're a reflection of himself he created angels to serve and worship him but he wanted something that would be his mate he was king and he wanted a queen sure there's a lot of churches but he wanted a bride he wanted a wife that he could marry himself to that would reflect his character why not churches oh there be redeemed from churches but you don't want to marry a wife that goes through the bible says i don't want that part i don't want that part i don't want that part i don't believe that part i don't believe that first i can't live that part i ain't gonna do that part i'm not gonna do that part i'm not gonna and he don't want you as a wife so you see it wasn't that god turned you down you turned yourself down don't blame god god don't send no person to hell he don't send no person through the tribulation period but your life reflects where you're going brother brandon would scream get back in step right and he would stream that in that vision get back in step because we as humanity attitudes thoughts even choices that we make send us down roads and men are standing in pulpits screaming stay in line stay in line don't get mad at ministry don't get mad at what god sent us the dress where to get you ready well i don't like that preacher i don't like that man i don't like this god sends different ministries and he builds them a certain way to prepare you brother brown prays a prayer and he said may our lives be so submitted to thee that the holy spirit will live itself through us and speak through us lord may we remember in our minds as we walk upon the street and rub our arms with the world that we're not suppo supposed to be like those we step aside and give them the place lord in their rightful position here on earth we'll take a back seat knowing that we are delegates from another world we have a kingdom that's coming into power and our great king will soon arrive and take over all the kingdoms that's in his domain and he shall rule and reign with and we shall rule and he shall rule and reign and him on the earth thousand years and be with him forever so a man has to surrender every ambition that he's got to his will everything that he's got prophet would speak a sermon called paul a prisoner i think it's a good sermon for you to listen to maybe this week paul a prisoner is one of the most powerful sermons that brother branham preaches and he's talking about our humanity our ambitions he's talking about how that we carry out our lives that we are a prisoner to jesus christ and you say well that's a difficult task brother branham brother brandon points out that paul called himself that being a prisoner to rome but he was also a prisoner to jesus christ jesus was standing in in john chapter 14 and verse 1. and he says this and now i'd like to just take this again two worlds let not your heart be troubled you believe in god we believe also in me in my father's houses in my father's house are many mansions and if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you now he could only say this to his inner circle of disciples because they would understand there were certain things that brother branham could only say to believers because believers would understand but i want to say this to you we're not too interested in the critic or the unbeliever to start off with i think so many times that we waste a lot of time trying to convert a goat or a devil in sheep's clothing that's not going to spend eternal life with us anyway are you with me now well how you know it buy their fruits by their fruits you you'll know them that's not being judgmental it's by their fruits by their life i want to read this for purpose isaiah chapter 53 and verse one you hear it here probably every week who hath believed our report into to whom is the arm of the lord revealed and verse 4 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and without with his stripes we are healed i was having a brain immoral on wednesday early wednesday morning i had the first appointment old people like the first appointment and so so anyway that's for most of us anyway so and so so anyway i was sitting and was a new nurse i hadn't met her before she was preparing me for the brain mri and and she was getting me ready she was a woman about my age and she had great gray hair in the front and the rest of it was kind of a chestnut brown and i never met her she was telling me her life story matthew says everybody seems to want to tell me their life story and so i just sat and listened for a while and she was going through i think it's about 50 questions that they give you before you go through and it's a yes or no or expand on it a little bit and i noticed she paused for a little while she was reading and i said well what are you reading she said i'm reading your report here and she said your report here says that you're a very sick man i said oh it doesn't she said yeah she said but you don't look like your report so your report might be bad but you don't look like your report timmy i guess i have to say this to you the devil may have a whole list of things that he's got against you but you don't look like that report now brother branham is going to speak shalom i'm not going to get done today but i'm just going to speak a while and is this okay if i just trying to take my time it kind of feels relaxed in here doesn't it and so brother branham is going to speak shalom now remember he's a prophet as a prophet he's not a normal speaker he's a prophet and he'll walk in be very cordial to the audience and and because of people's faith and expectation people will get healed as he walks to the platform because they've seen so many miracles brother branham has a different way of talking he's he's got that a hillbilly talking he's just talking he makes us all feel comfortable whether you're from africa or zimbabwe or wherever you're from or ireland or switzerland he just had a way of just making us all just relaxed and he would talk to us about what god thought of us talk to us about how god called us from another realm and you know you know just after the seals and god hit and re reeled in simplicity and and then the seals are released and that's god himself opening in the word to the bride and it's to the bride and all of the bride's going to understand it and so night after night brother brahma would say he said now i don't know what tomorrow night is and then the next night he would come and say he met me in the room the same one that met moses that met enoch that stood there and said blessed are ye blessed are the peacemakers and if you can look past the veil and hear god because that's the sheep music if you fall in love with brother branham you missed the picture if you come on this hill and fall in love with me or andrew you missed the picture because there's a mightier one that is here but the brand will say i can't see past 1977. but many of you were born after 1977. so god knew that there's going to be people that were in darkness that would have great light and ye are the light of the world so brother branham will come and speak a sermon on shalom and in shalom he will talk about how dark and how gross dark it is and then he will begin to talk about a symphony peter and the wolf and he'll talk about the symphony how that everything has its place and has its timing and even even that little little little little little bell everything is just exactly right on time and then he said now it'll sound like a bunch of rocket to you if you don't understand the music well you're not going to hear this in in the nominal churches and so brother branham is beginning to take us all the way and he begins to show us begins to show us how that god has been all the way down to the end through since the beginning as a symphony playing out the music and he has certain characters to play certain parts any any any and then he comes down now it's your turn now it's your place he said to the world they're not interested in it it sounds like a bunch of racket to them but if i can paraphrase the bride is interested [Applause] are you with me so sister cassie you'll like this so friday night i spent i spent about two hours listening to beethoven ten minutes with chopin so a little bit with bach but i'm interested in that kind of music because everything is just right listen that's not having just anybody come to play best of best so i googled you google i googled what made beethoven so special and it was in his thoughts that my music is not just for a generation but it's for eternity he said i'm not just playing to please people here but i want my music for eternity i thought about god moses writes jeremiah writes ezekiel writes nahum writes obadiah rots paul writes your new testament everyone just in its right place if it was not for history you would have a hard time figuring out paul's in prison and in chains and locked up and what a difficult because he's playing the music in such a way it's not paul playing it's got through paul playing [Applause] brother brandon would take the pulp out for us we know but he take the pulpit in many places in the world and he didn't tell him what to some pity party he didn't he didn't tell him i was from a bootlegger's son i'm here to represent jesus christ and he came with a representation that i'm here to reflect him i think we make a very big mistake if we're not here to reflect jesus christ now beethoven came to a spot actually actually what my understanding is and i can be corrected later but my understanding that his greatest masterpieces came after he became deaf he became an isolationist and in his isolationist he became very agitated in crowds and he he didn't like to be around people and that made him moody and made him hateful and yet he was doing his best work are you with me i'm gonna preach now the devil does not know what he's doing when he gives a man cancer i want to lay some things here for us just for a moment because we're here we're living it this ain't a fiction book we're living this thing so the devil can't touch a hair of our head until he gets permission from god so he goes and gets permission from god you got a preacher down there that's given me a whole lot of trouble and i'd like to tempt his life i'd like to touch his flesh for a while and god said go ahead he's going to be more powerful he's going to be stronger i'm going to trust him like never before he's going to shake your kingdom up so beethoven cuts the legs off of the off of the piano and places the piano on the wooden floor and so now he can't hear the music but the vibrations will he be in his ear and so he writes his masterpiece work here's something i didn't know he would go to the back of the concert hall and put his ear on the floor and listen to when the director would play his music and listen nobody in the building knew that the real guy was in the building but he was back there making sure they did it right in another realm in another realm there's a god that's watching over the the participants of this orchestra watching they dress right they walk right they talk right their character's right they're filled with the spirit of god they're playing the music [Applause] brother brown would explain to us that when they mold the bell they'll put certain certain chemicals or certain i'm looking for the word there's certain wars but there's a certain composites that put it together to have a certain sound it is said that there's no bird has the same sound that's incredible no cricket has the same sound every one of them is just a touch off of the other brother shannon it is said that your life's companion when you were so upset in life your life's companion her giggle calms you think about how god built us dandelion sunflower seeds beautiful forests that we've got here god built it for you now there's millions and billions because of the the nature and the fall of man but through all that god's got a seed god's got a seed and it's not that you could gather yourself to it predestination we love this church we love what's going on here but somewhere another this lady sitting over here in pink there was a boy chased her around the building and kissed her and she fell in love with that boy knowing his reputation but she couldn't see the powerhouse that was laying on the inside of him [Applause] sister nancy and the eternities you'll set with queens [Music] you're set with queens sister branham would be just down the road wasn't just some little frilly girl god was watching over he was orchestrating you had to live here because two seeds had to come together come on church listen it wasn't you found your way in god got a hold of you maybe you didn't understand it maybe actually you was against it for quite a while and one day the light came on [Applause] the light come on and you saw yourself and before long you're playing the music there may have been moments that you struggle with certain parts of it maybe you didn't understand hair maybe you didn't understand baptism maybe you didn't understand god sent a prophet maybe you didn't understand where you were in the scriptures and then you just kept looking at it and maybe even fighting it god don't get worry with you he don't get weary with you he doesn't get weary he gives you all the time in the world because he knows they'll be there here's a prayer that i pray i'm going to let you in on a prayer that i pray i'm to be at brother kelly hildebrandt's at the end of september i'm to be a brother tim pruitt's in october and then i'm going to be done done until maybe easter and so here's my prayer god you know that i need to be at a certain spot these men have felt unction to have me there now regardless of my circumstances you need to have me ready there's things that are way out of my control am i preaching to you now come on lord you know you know way beyond my humanity god said you're going to have a boy his name's going to be joseph and daughters are born and critics come brown couldn't orchestrate that got to give him a vision you just got to wait on it he just he just he just kept waiting on it are you with me god gives you a vision you can't do anything about it he tells you you're going to be well you just walk in the faith you just walk i'm just walking and one day doctors will tell me you don't have cancer no more now let me just say this to you and i'm going to just drop a few things here you have to put yourself in a position to be blessed you have to move in a position to be blessed now sometimes you might want to play the trombone but your gift is the flute you're grinding it down you might want to be the preacher when your gift is the usher every one of us has got a place i'll tell you when you become comfortable is when you come to your place i watch young people as they're growing up here said sarah sarah would you just stand real quick for me sarah was had quit school she was working in a in a in a job selling clothes and things were happening i met her outside of church and i said sarah you need to go back to school she cried she cries easy don't you hurt her whatever you do don't you hurt her and she crying i said you got to go back to school it's not easy going back to school been out of school for a while got to pay for school school ain't cheap preacher tells you you've got to go to school she's going to affect hundreds and hundreds of people and people if tom last people are going to look back there was a godly teacher that loved and cared people of broken homes people that had devastated lives and there was one person one person in god's orchestra that was standing and playing [Applause] david could you stand davey had two children that was getting ready to come doctor said it was impossible a wreck said it was impossible his wife's doctor said it was impossible but the vision said you're going to have children davey as a young man was standing on the porch and he told me he said brother ron i'm he said i'm working beside of people that's making double sometimes even triple what i'm making he said but but you know should i take that job should i go to job work with them i'm doing the same thing they're doing they're making double even triple what i'm what i'm making and he said could you pray about it i did i'm not your holy ghost but i pray you ask me to pray i pray i legitimately pray and so i prayed the next week then i told him something that was just crazy don't take it now that sounds for the natural carnal man says i'm doing the same thing they're doing and they're making double triple what i'm doing i'm putting at the same time they're getting triple money what i'm doing they move them to mexico within the next week or so and davey would have had to gone to mexico but he needed to be here to marry my daughter he had two children that had to come brother jordan and sister kirsten we baptize them in old order clothes how'd they got here i'll never figure out but god that is rich in mercy brother ron but i don't see the results look right here don't look at the short term of your life don't look at the short term of your life decades later look back maybe you can't see the will of god under your feet but decades later look back and say god knew me there god placed me there god put me under that word [Applause] none of us want to put a fish if we're drawing put a fish in a tree that's not its rightful place none of us want to reflect hollywood and its nonsense or even this music generation and it's nonsense or even some feeble man we want to reflect christ that's the reason it tells us to eat the book and have the life of jesus christ you hear us worship here now listen don't get offended at us we may be the noisy part of heaven but we're in the orchestra not everybody's going to play the trump the triangle or do a brush some of us are going to be noisy you're going to need some warriors for the fight you're going to need some worship leaders [Applause] now let me just say this to you sometimes you don't understand people some of you as a child watched andrew and matthew grow up never in your mind saw them as leaders here in this church they didn't get that because of me or even brother homer pretty protective for this pulpit but god anointed them to be worship leaders to lead you in worship to prepare you for the coming word to get you in an atmosphere to bring you from from difficulties at home difficulties on your job difficulties in your life and to bring you into an atmosphere where you can feed on the word to get your mind off of all of those things now no doubt no doubt as in many other places brother timothy pruitt which is a worship warrior i was there in the days when people became became jealous of timothy didn't want him to be the song leader man left the church didn't want him singing certain songs that were rejoice songs you know they they got all upset but you were it wasn't man-appointed god could care less about humanity's feelings i'm gonna preach i'm not done he's he can care less about your feelings and your opinions and your thoughts on an issue he has raised up a man for a purpose and that man will carry out that purpose as a prisoner to jesus christ he will play the music he will be the part he will reflect jesus christ tim could not brother tim could not make timothy a worship warrior he could not make him a convention speaker like he is today god did that as i watched andrew after he preached last night no doubt our minds go back to brother homer but brother homer he could not make andrew do that listen if we had that ability you would make your children serve god be on fire for god set right here but god that's rich in mercy it'll take the same experience for them that it did for you and god's faithful enough to go meet them [Applause] he'll take you from the back seat to the front seat he'll set you on fire [Applause] without raising your hands how many has ever what's the ten commandments thank you a man named charleston heston played the part charleston heston those that know him in his real life was was a man that was an nra advocate said a lot of things about the nra and but he studied the life of moses the character of moses the ways of moses the history of moses until when he stepped into the part he actually had to go into an institution to step out of the part amen think about that because he actually came to a spot to where he thought he was moses that's what happens in religion and if you can do that without a new birth to where people think they're a christian but really don't have the life you just need the new birth because the new birth what will it do let me just let me just stop you just for a moment christ comes himself inside of you it'll cause emotions it'll cause tongues speaking it'll cause visions it'll cause being able to cast out levels but it'll take sin out of your life it'll take filthy habits out of your life it'll cleanse you it'll change your habits it'll change your friendships you want to make nothing christ wants to come and live on the inside of you so you become a star that reflects him brother gene i would say where you work at you haven't been there wrong but i would say already people recognize you as a christian isn't that true and you don't have to say a word it's what you don't do that says light sometimes some people say well i want to be a chatterbox and be a christian i want to be a witness testimony just be quiet just be real quiet just yeah sure there's times to talk there's times to just be still i want you understand jesus says some powerful things but in his quietness and his silence he's more powerful he could have called 10 000 angels to come and set him free just one would have did it now i'm not going to get done so let me just come to this point brother bram's laying with his hands behind his head and he says he's actually laying there thinking about you know to me what he's done at that point is phenomenal it's the enough to write a library is full of what the accomplishments that god's had in his life and he's saying i've done nothing for christ i haven't did anything it's kind of how you feel you heard andrew say last night he said sometimes you feel like a christian sometimes you don't that's a direct quote from brother branham he said there's days i feel like a christian or today's adult so don't you feel like you're some odd bird because you've got an enemy fighting you and you're still dealing with your humanity and in just a moment the angel asked him would you like to look beyond the curtain of time i'm still on my subject and just he looked back at his body there was his body laying there then when he gets there brother craig is he looks down at his hands and his hands are young and he comes to a point to where he rubs his hair and he's he's got hair that's nice he's got hair maybe he should point that he's got here and brother branham he begins to meet people that dimension he feels perfect love he didn't feel that laying on a bed but in that dimension he feels perfect love and there's women that comes up and hugs him and he doesn't feel because in that dimension that's not there and the angel asked him he said do you do you recognize that lady that sister he said you led her to christ past 95 and she was a young woman you know we look at death much different than god looks at death we sorrow we cry we agonize but if we could look in that eternal realm my mom my father stepped beyond the realm of time brother homer stepped beyond the realm of time and stepped into a well body now they long to come back to this room to see us and then we'll go to see the lord and brother bran was asking he asked are these my are these are these my family are these my these are my converts i said you're converts and he said well will i be accepted and he said i preach what paul preached i preached what peter preached and he said and all of us begin to scream we're resting on that so the sheep music we don't need to change it's not about you know we come over to a certain part well i don't want to play that part so i'll just skip it no you may have to wrestle with it a while can i give you one more instance brother donny is sitting in the back and i said it's been months ago and i said brother donnie me and you go sing together tonight brother donny walks up and he's standing here beside here and he don't know what i'm going to do and we're going to sing together he don't know and i just started talking i talked about brother donnie you know the world would like to have brother donny's gift and they'd like to pay him to be a professional musician that week somebody had made him an offer i didn't know that but there was one standing that was the director of all of this orchestra that knows all about you dollywood makes him an offer to play in dollywood now you know to the natural humanity you know i don't get that offer ron will you come and sing what andrew's got didn't come from me he didn't come from me it obviously came from another side it didn't come from me it sorry dad it didn't come from you he could never keep time they were playing in one court he was singing in another he was way off time get with me he would say get with me get with me so that didn't come from dad he's a worship leader on steroids it's all right it's all right brother donny plays for the bride of jesus christ and one day when we're standing there in that great orchestra i won't break it well i break a lot of things don't and there he stands a young man it'll be worth it after all [Music] that'll be worth it after all don't you love him what about your part what about your place if you can look back just for a moment and this is what i want to do with you brother jim if you can look back in your life and you've you've done some work for me your life is astonishing to me how god got you here i mean for those that haven't had a moment with him how god had got him here is a phenomenal deal but he's here if you can look back in your life and in the moment that you're thinking god hadn't done nothing for me crystal is that true god just goes okay look back i want to show you what i brought you from to what you are now is that true is that true is that true well brother on i was a mess yeah we all was i was in real bad trouble we all was but he knows how to pick us up he knows how to pick us up he loves lawyers he loves lawyers he he'd give us two i hope i never need your services but i love you [Applause] don't you love him with all your hearts here's what i want to come to brother braham said as we're marching in angels will stand and watch because they can't sing amazing grace amen because they've never known what it's like to be lost but the anthem of heaven will be amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me thank you for your attention this morning god bless you listen to our feet i love you with all my heart looks so good [Music] don't you worry little children should death knock on your door don't you know that there is a doorway and it leads to the heavenly shore over there there's no heartache no sorrow need no [Music] [Music] towards [Music] one day i know final step he is going to set me [Music] over the free hill i look and i see victory
