thank all of you for coming and amen so good to have you amen we love you with all of our hearts a special happening has taken place we have brother Nathan Erickson and sister Cheyenne that's with us and we're so honored to have them my mind goes back a long way 1994 when I began to preach it his grandfather's Church on his father's side Brother Ray Erickson and we've had an incredible amount of meetings there since 94 we've been there quite a few times then his grandfather on the other side was brother Samuel Johnson and I was fighting not wanting to ever preach and and I'd go to meetings I was just converted we were just married and we couldn't go to a meeting without somebody calling me out and said you're called to preach young man you're called to preach I'd get mad and so we went to Brother Henry Green's meeting brother Samuel Johnson was preaching unbeknownst to me I was staying right beside her brother Samuel sister Connie and myself and we we didn't have children then and and I I went to take some luggage out to the to the car I didn't know what the brother Samuel was sitting in the van with his foot the door opened foot up in the where the mirror would be on just on the inside and he was sitting with his foot and he I walked past him he said young man yes yes sir he said I don't know you but there's a light following you and he said you're called to preach and he just kind of grabbed me and kind of held me you know and he said your ministry will Eclipse mine I was thinking he's the speaker of this meeting and and he said and you'll lead tens of thousands to the Lord and now his grandson is going to preach for us tonight so I woke up with a lot of emotions today and so we just are so thankful sister Cheyenne so glad to have you with us and and uh I hope you get a chance to meet them and uh they're just they're just incredible preacher and he's an incredible preacher amen and so we he's got good Bloodlines and so we're just you pull on the gift and God will operate that gift and so we're so honored to have him with us tonight emotional day I I want to share one more thing with you we went to eat with them today and and Connie said I need to go buy a store and I I said okay and so so she went by a store and Andrew went with us and he said actually he says what's she doing I said I have no idea and she had dropped something off she had to pick it up and so when she came out she said I guess I need to give you something and I said okay 16 years ago they cut This Ring Off when they cut it off they asked me you have any last words I said I do Dr Kramer told me he said I thought I was was the last words you'd ever say and I looked over at Homer and Thomas and I told them I love you and they put me to sleep for a month and that ring I hadn't seen it again until today [Applause] uh I'm sorry I was going into a very vicious battle then brother Vernon this is what I believe this is a sign I'm going to come out of this battle thank you doctors want to talk to me about my last days I want to talk to my new beginnings that's what I want to believe tonight we've got an incredible incredible dedication and it Blends it Blends special families together and the Spencer family and Gabriel moved here to help take care of his uncle and while he was here he fell in love with two people Jesus [Applause] queen bee he couldn't have a better mother-in-law God bless your heart and Sarah Jesus changed his life forever and so did Sarah brother Branham talks about it when a man marries a woman he marries a woman that is is actually his character said that reflects the inside of him and he said when he marries her he said what they've done they stepped out of Eternity into a space of time and then one day they'll step back into eternity again amen amen so if you guys will come maybe the Spencer family will be on this side and of course they're going to have a crew and we're going to and however you come will be happy but but please comment I'd like for you all to come I like for you all cloy you're part of the family now too so Mark I want you to come I want you to Mark if you would say prayer for us here amen Right Here Comes one of my little buddies her name's Aaliyah it's interesting that it's interesting that Zoe can't say a lot of words but she can say Aaliyah the most clear yeah yeah that's right [Laughter] amen amen God bless you Amen brother Gabriel and Sister Sarah Amen brother Mark if you'll come stand by my side if you will God bless you all amen it's a great day it is we're just getting started here maybe they'll have 10. glory to God that's not a prophecy that's just a wish amen I think we're too close to the Rapture for all that amen in a baby dedication it's important the importance is is because Jesus was brought and he was brought for circumcision but it was also for dedication and so Jesus would take out time as well as our Prophet did and brother Abraham had incredible you know he's going to preach two or three hours maybe four but he would maybe dedicate 10 babies because he felt it so important and so today we come for for Uriah Judah and the scripture says that hear o Israel the Lord our God the Lord is one love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your strength and these Commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts press them upon your children talk about them when you sit down at home and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you get up we grew up in that kind of home amen first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 27. I prayed for this child and the Lord is granting me what I asked for so now I give him to the Lord for his whole life he will be given over to the Lord and they Worship the Lord there you named him special an incredible name a very powerful name Uriah means Yahweh is light you named him after God put in your second name the middle name you called him Judah and it was Leah that was married to Jacob that was so hated when she gave birth to Judah that name means praise it also is an attributed to the lion of the tribe of Judah and I think about how powerful this name is for those that don't know brother Branham that would that would have many special friends so when I get to heaven the first man I'd like to shake hands with is Uriah who was a soldier in David's Army and he was a dedicated man and he was bathsheba's husband and he refused to go lie with Bathsheba because his brothers was at War and I want you to remember the other part of that he was a gentile he was a gentile and being a gentile he had no promise to him but because he was fighting for his King it brought him into the Covenant I'd say that's pretty special this guy is going to be a really special little fella with this child you have a charge and God reminds us that God gave him to you and he's in your home now we're going to give him back to God now you'll watch over him and you'll take care of him you'll do your best of raising you'll do your best to protecting you'll be your best to watch over him and be with him and help him with his friendships you took him out and changed his diapers so he'd be clean for this event in all things you will do your absolute best I have that confidence in you and God gave him to you through your wounds now you're giving him back to God and in doing so God has a covenant with you that he'll watch over him and he'll protect him and this Covenant will be with him until he gets to the age of accountability and at the age of accountability he'll be given choice so you were his holy ghost until he gets to the age of accountability and you'll do a good job and in doing so then we know that he has a 97 percent better chance because what we believe is stepping out of a realm of time he was manifested now as the physical attribute of god of what he thought of before the foundation of the world Uriah was written there and now he's living how big was he when he was born four pounds and two ounces amen amen Mark I'm I'm going to hold him first oh and we're going to get pictures and then you're going to hold him and get pictures come crowding come grandma Hallelujah all these preachers in the family Uriah preached to us brother Terry look at this come on in here look at all these boys to training one way or the other thing that's okay [Music] now we got to do it again [Music] now you stop crying yeah that's better than anything all right all right Sister Sarah if you're coming just lay your hands on him here just now amen I want you to pray how much precious in the Bible in the middle father Lord Jesus the creator of heavens and earth Lord through your mind and do your thinking Lord you've seen us standing here this evening oh what a glorious occasion it is Lord we see the Miracles has taken place in this church we see brother Ron Lord is he standing here showing the works of you Lord through your healing and you're revealing and opening up this message of the hour and Lord for this time lord and brother Uriah Gabriel my son Sarah my daughter-in-law Lord as they brought forth this son they brought forth a son that would give you glory and Lord as we think about dedication Lord what dedication took for two people to come together yes Lord for the love of God to be between them Lord and they dedicate their lives and now they're bringing their son to you Lord and they're going to raise him in a way that only you can have them to raise it Lord I'm praying Lord you would just bless these footsteps Lord even though they may be small now but lord they're going to grow up one day Lord a representative of Jesus Christ Lord I Thank you Lord Jesus Lord for what you're doing for this family praying praying Lord you would just keep your hand upon them touching their lives in a special way oh God the Mimi's and grannies and Lord touching them and Lord and each day that passes Lord may we give you glory and thank you Lord Lord for this son that has come into this Earth the Lord Lord many have come but Lord this is their first time I remember my first one Michael Lord is he coming into the world I thought there was no other child Lord and now look and I'll see all my children God fearing saved by the grace of God stand here and see it is Lord I'm so blessed my emotions are so high but Lord you

god of the impossible amen hallelujah God bless you Saints it's really such an honor to be here with you uh it just means everything to stand behind this Pulpit which is a little short for me but uh because of what the ministry here and and the fellowship here has meant to us over the years I think the last time I was in this church I was just a little boy not any kind of a preacher or anything still not but but I have a lifetime of memories and testimonies I can look back on with brother Ron as he said first time he came and preached for us I believe I was about four years old we've seen so much Supernatural amen so much evidence of a living God amen so we just preach you very much for the wrong we bring a lot of greetings from back home from the church there from Brother Wayne from the Erickson family and uh and we're just believing with you for a miracle amen amen there's uh Saints back home fervently praying and believing amen and expecting amen and we appreciate brother Andrew he uh he's a real celebrity around our parts Our Youth Camp preacher in a little less than a month we're we're looking forward to having him with us and brother Ron coming up as well boy we're excited amen amen so we just uh my mind is there with this young generation and what the Lord is doing we're seeing very very exciting things transpiring right now right in this time this season amen and with this Young Generation with the the ones that are coming up taking the Baton amen we're just excited about what the Lord is doing so with that in mind I'd like to not keep it too long tonight and go right to the word and Joshua the first chapter of course I'm a little nervous tonight not because I'm scared of you because I love you amen and so I'm going to take a moment here just to get feeling right at home Joshua chapter one I've been looking at this this passage of scripture it's very timely I think I think the beautiful thing about the Joshua type is it's timely no matter what generation you're a part of amen because we're all having the same experience amen of bringing God out of History amen and looking for a manifestation in our own day a fulfillment of the promise so we'll read the Joshua commission it's very familiar to us all verses one to nine here in the Book of Joshua the Bible says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses his minister or servant saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses amen precious words so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shout out divide for an inheritance the lamb which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether so ever thou goest the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee withersoever thou goest amen May Lord bless the word let's just have a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're looking to you tonight Lord to be the fulfiller of every promise Lord we have nothing of ourselves to offer and yet Lord we we find a call a commission in your word father that we are to be the ones that possess the promise and Lord we look at the time that we're living in we look at all the types of the scripture and everything testifying Lord Lord that we should be expecting a great move of God in this day Lord you sent a prophet to tell us that the move was on in The Bride of Jesus Christ but we're thankful Lord that that's no Theory to us lord it's not a mental conception but Lord we're living in the reality of it and I pray father you'd open up your word tonight Lord by your spirit that Lord we could just see a little more clearly what you've called us to do Lord of who we are in your eyes Lord and and may you make it a fulfilled thing in every life I pray Lord we have nothing to offer Lord we're completely insufficient Lord we're looking to you may you come down tonight Lord and and take these vessels of clay may you be the speaker tonight Lord may you also be The Interpreter Lord and from the beginning to the end Lord may it be a quickened thing of your spirit Lord that you would have complete control Lord we want to just get out of your way tonight as we dedicate ourselves and dedicate this service to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you as you're seated tonight amen I want to try not to keep you long amen but I'd just like to say a few words about the Joshua generation amen the Joshua generation and how many believe that the Joshua type applies to the Bride of Jesus Christ amen I I believe that with all of my heart we know that we've had a Ministry in our day a man of an end time prophet and that prophet's Ministry was a Joshua Ministry amen he had that from the angel of the Lord he preached the message as I was with Moses so I will be with thee Amen in spoken words The Original Seed brother Branham said that Joshua represents the promised end time leader who would take the church over and Caleb would represent the True Believer who stayed with Joshua amen and in a paradox he said that Joshua is a type of the last day Ministry so brother Branham could look at this type in the Bible and he could apply it to his own day and even to his own Ministry that he would be a Joshua Ministry that would lead the Church of God into a land of full promise fulfillment amen amen but I I believe that Joshua not only has things to represent just the end time profit but I believe that that Joshua represents the end time believer amen amen it's a it's an anointing or a commission which is on the Church of God Amen to to go into the land of promise and possess everything that God has said that the church should be in possession of amen amen that that's the great thing about the Joshua type is it applies to every generation no matter what time that you're living in you can look back and see a god of History you see that Jesus Christ was something yesterday amen but there has to be a cry in the Christian heart and say to say I want to see Jesus Christ the same today as he was yesterday and I want to have I want to believe that that tomorrow he'll be the same that he is today and the same that he was yesterday amen amen and so I believe that I believe that we are a Joshua people brother Brandon preach the message adoption and he said that our Ephesians or our Joshua remember he said there has to be an Ephesians to this amen there has to be a fulfillment to this message and he said our Ephesians our Joshua is the Holy Spirit and he is our great warrior and he is our great leader and he said as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us about amen now if you're living a Christian Life that's got no movement you've got no direction there's no vision amen you're not looking for God to be doing something right now in the present time then then brother you've missed the commission amen because God sent a message or to tell you under Vindication he said thus saith the Lord it's not any man's idea it's not some some kind of a emotional workup or or just somebody trying to manufacture a Revival it's the saith the Lord that there is a move on for the Bride of Jesus Christ and I can show you in the message where he started the move but you can't show me where he ever called it off amen I believe the god that moved 60 years ago is moving today I believe he's moving tonight amen I believe anyone who's a god enough to Joshua anointing on them amen to believe that we'll see a move of God in their life they'll catch up Vision they'll catch a direction from this message you're not just sitting on your hands waiting for a Rapture today you're going somewhere Church there's a leadership in The Bride of Jesus Christ there's a headship there is a vision hallelujah amen brother Branham said there's got to be a Joshua of this day he preached as I was with Moses and I think it's amazing most of the time he's comparing himself to Moses in a message that was supposed to represent him as a Joshua but he also said there'd be a spiritual Joshua in the last day a Joshua believer amen now how many are interested to know how brother Branham would Define a Joshua believer and I think he's going to pick a few scriptures here and he's going to and and so it's a prophet that's drawn the highlights it's a prophet that's putting the emphasis and says hey if there's a spiritual Joshua in the end time here's the here's the word that he's going to go with and brother bran said uh uh Joshua of this day if the Bible said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God the spiritual Joshua will say the the same thing if the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the spiritual Joshua will say the same thing amen as Peter on the day of Pentecost said receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the spiritual Joshua will never vary one iota amen but he said he'll make just exactly what the word said if Mark 16 said these signs shall follow them that believe amen the spiritual Joshua will say the same thing Amen brother branham's telling you in this end time amen if you're looking for a Joshua commission if you're looking for a Joshua Church it'll be a church that believes in the baptism of the Holy Ghost believes that the the signs and wonders shall follow them that believe believes that Jesus Christ is not a story out of a history book but he's the same today with the same power the same signs the same baptism amen the same feelings the same Sensations hallelujah amen God he'll have one he'll have a Joshua don't be afraid of that amen amen this thing ain't conquered yet but he's got a Joshua and actually when God removed Moses off the scene no doubt it was a time of great consternation it was a you know it was it was much confusion amongst the people because they thought Moses would take them all the way in but and so when God took Moses off the scene a lot of people got shook a lot of people were unsettled but he already had somebody on the scene he already had a Joshua Amen to fulfill Moses his message God wasn't worried friends amen God wasn't concerned amen the wheels of predestination were already turning amen when God took his Prophet off the scene it was only to put a Joshua in his place amen and Joshua would take a whole people into the land amen and so don't think just because brother Branham amen has passed away that there's no Joshua Ministry that that there's no Joshua commission for the church friends we've had a lot of people come say hey Hey brother branham's died now you got to follow me we've had a lot of eighth Messengers we had a lot of Kingdom Builders we had a lot of personalities and celebrities and amen and opportunist around the message amen but listen we're not looking for that we're not looking for that but well we're looking for amen is is for the God that was to be the god that is amen I say as long as there are Holy Ghost filled spirit-led Sons and Daughters of God this Joshua ministry will continue until we possess every square inch of our adoption until we fulfill every promise until we defeat every devil until the molecules of this body amen change from Mortal to immortality this Joshua Ministry is going to go on Amen this bride's Revival didn't die in 1965. it's more alive today than it ever was amen look around you're living in it it's the greatest day amen Joshua was more than a general Joshua was an Army Joshua was a movement he was a power Hallelujah Hallelujah brother Bram said he said if he doesn't come in my generation he said I know not I hope so but I know that there will be young men that will raise up that'll sweep this message on and they'll take this message and sweep it to the coming of the Lord amen and he didn't come in brother Brown's generation amen but the message never stopped amen the last never stopped amen the overcoming never stopped brother sister amen but there's a new generation amen that are called not just to be Believers of the message but we're called to be fulfillers of the message amen that's why we're not looking for another word we're not looking for some new message some new dispensation some new word or some new Revival he said they won't take another message he said they'll take this message and they'll sweep it on to the coming of the Lord that's what we're doing with all of our hearts Brothers history amen as we're running with the message God sent amen we're not going to lay it down because God took the prophet off the scene or cause the years have come pass by or because of what some teacher said or some Kingdom Builder friends where a Joshua generation amen God gave Joshua the key to overcome amen he gave him gave him a promise but he put it on a contingency he said you remember the message of Moses don't look to the left don't look to the right he said you remember what Moses preached and you take what Moses preached meditated every day meditate on it every night Let It Be Your Daily Bread Let It Be Your Drive Let It Be Your Vision let it be your direction and if you'll do that Joshua nobody will stand in your way everything you lift your hand to will prosper amen don't look to the left or the right just stay with the message amen we've had Nathans and chorus around this message that have tinkered with it Decades of tampering amen of of correcting of trying to fix the message I I just say don't mess with the message but if you believe the message amen there's a promise that goes with it stay true to it and he said as I was with William Branham you with thee amen amen that ought to go down to the to the littlest individual to the youngest child to the simplest Christian to the lowest status in the church amen don't don't look upward friends look inward amen because this message has been poured out on a generation of people amen the promise applies as I was with William Branham as I was with Ray Erickson as I am with Ron Spencer I'm with you amen and I've called you out to join this thing I've called you to be an overcomer amen I've called you to do the exploits I've called you to do the overcoming Hallelujah stay true to it there's power in it there's overcoming in it there's purpose in it amen but you got to believe it you got to stay with it you got to step into the water sometime sometime in the individual life it's got to come down to a place where you got to believe it for yourself then brother Braham say the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen and that first step's a hard one [Music] it's a hard one for many people when you come down like Joshua came and he came down to the Jordan River and now here's the Proving Ground because he had all the he had all the nice things that Moses said about him he had all the you know he had all the leadership over the people he had all everything established but there was one thing in the way and that was an impossible obstacle amen there's no going around it no going under it no going over it hey man you got to step into it you got to step into it and then no doubt you know because Spirits never die at that time it was probably like this time where a lot of people were saying God doesn't do good things like that anymore yeah he parted the Red Sea but see Moses gone and what are you gonna do Joshua what are you gonna do amen when you get down to that water and maybe some people were saying well you know maybe maybe Moses will come back out of the mountains and someday Moses will come back he'll part the water then we can be Overcomers then we can have a Revival then we can eat the milk and honey amen and that's what they were looking for amen but see Joshua but see that Joshua is is there with a commission now now you you can't make the commission watch this now it's quite amazing if if Mo if Joshua's commissioned was just to say exactly what Moses said and and do exactly just don't even preach Joshua don't even get behind the pulpit just say what he said just play tape amen don't change anything then he would have waved his arm and he would have waved his arm till it fell off and the waters would have never parted amen but see the God that was over the head of Moses when he came to the Red Sea that God that looked down with Angry Eyes amen now he was in an ark amen and Joshua was marching behind that Ark and so he gets down to his greatest obstacle he couldn't even he wasn't even a square one just to take that first step with God that's the way it is for many people it's the first step is often the hardest because oh I don't know if I really opened that door to the Lord if if I really take that step if I really what if I act like that guy or what if something happens to me or what if this comes out or what if I got to give up that it's a hard step but sooner later you're gonna have to take it amen you can't water in this Wilderness forever you were born for greater things so he comes down to that water and he's going to take that step and I think it's amazing just put my head in the minds of those priests because right up until that last inch that foot hovering over that Russian water there was absolutely nothing to say Amen that they wouldn't get just Swept Away immediately amen there was nothing nothing there's their eyes were saying nothing their feelings were saying nothing their ears there was nothing nothing in their sensibilities to say that there would be anything but but death when they took that step nothing to say except the commission accept the commission amen put on a commission amen when you take that step amen when you believe that the God that was with the prophet amen is tabernacled in your Ark amen take that step Don't Be Afraid amen because the promise is as I was with Moses so I will be with you take another step with me amen and I'll part the waters you don't have to part it you don't have to swim across ow part the waters you just believe my word amen take that step step into that healing step into that Deliverance step into that new birth don't be afraid to take the step it's time for it it's a Joshua time Hallelujah amen you you come into a Jordan it's not sooner or later on the way to your promise you're coming to a river friends but what you've got to realize when you come to the river amen that see there's something spoken over you that don't have anything to do with rivers amen because there is an adoption message preach amen which says there's a mountain in there and it belongs to you amen judah's got his Mountain simeon's got his Mountain Levi's got his Mountain amen but I've got my Mountain amen and I know there's a mountain now I don't know everything about the rivers I got across I don't know everything about The Valleys I gotta pass through I don't know about the Giants I don't know about the strongholds but one thing I know I'm gonna stand on my mountain amen so when I come to the water I gotta step into it amen when it come to a dark Valley you gotta step into it don't be afraid it'll part for you why because God promised you something it didn't have to do with your circumstances it had to do with your destiny amen Hallelujah amen it says that commission doesn't mention every river the commission doesn't talk about every Valley but what it says is whatever you run into on the way to your Mountain it belongs to you it belongs to you it's under your feet amen and so it'll be a footstep that'll mean possession amen you can stand around all day wondering but when you take that step God will back it up because he promised you a Mountaintop Hallelujah actually in Joshua 11 it's amazing it says that the Lord hardened the hearts of everybody in that land those P the children of Israel couldn't get no peace in that land because the Lord hardened hearts of everybody who lived there to come against his people say why would God send the enemy against his people so the enemy could get beat so the enemy could get beat amen so many times we wonder God why do you have me in this Valley why do I have to be fighting this fight why do why why do I have to be in this condition because it's on the way to the mountain amen and so God has said it in your way amen not for your destruction Amen to prove something about you amen that you're more than a conqueror amen we won't get out of this we won't get out of this thing without facing some real giants it won't all be easy battles amen but somebody's got to get cancer amen so God can prove amen that cancer is under your feet somebody's got a battle depression Somebody's gotta battle suicide somebody's got to be hurt somebody's got to be bitter amen not for your destruction but to prove you're the greatest army that's ever lived you're the Invincible Army of God [Applause] step into it take another step what are you afraid of amen there's a commission over you Hallelujah there it stands Joshua looking at Jericho and Joshua was thinking to himself how many how are we gonna do this one how are we going to handle this this is the it's the greatest stronghold that's ever been battled amen it's never been it's never been besieged it's never been taken the walls have never been breached and there he's standing there looking and wondering and thinking about Jericho and all of a sudden a mighty Angel appears to him amen the captain of a Salvation and Joshua was looking at Jericho but the Angels looking back at him amen the angel wasn't looking at Jericho the angel was looking to Joshua and he's saying Joshua what's laying in front of you it's already behind me I'm not looking at the obstacle I'm looking at the one that I commission Amen to tear those walls down Hallelujah glory be to God friends and amen and we've been ministered to by a mighty Angel amen who came with an unsheeted sword of an unsealed book amen and he didn't want us just to believe in it he wanted us to take that book he wanted us to prophesy he wanted to see some boldness in the church amen Hallelujah some ambition it's an ambition brother Nathan brother Bram said if I see a church it hasn't got high ambition something wrong with that church something wrong with that church of God is built on high ambitions amen Hallelujah amen see the message came to show you what belongs to you it didn't come to address the battles it just said there'd be some it didn't come to it didn't come to glorify all the hardships that we would go through it's actually you that's being glorified by the hardships amen he's glorifying himself his strength is made perfect in what in weakness amen amen and so there Comes A Time in the Christian's life amen where you got to just believe what was said about you there's something's got to well up on the inside now you might be in a cycle for years and years like shamgar amen and you're in that cycle of you get somewhere and the enemy takes it away and you get somewhere with God and the enemy takes it away but sometime brother sister Something's Gotta raise up in the heart Amen to say no I gotta stand on the promise there's a commission over me I don't have to give ground I can take a step and God will back it up amen amen you gotta strike the water you gotta strike the water look at Elisha who represents the bride is that right and Elisha amen went through an experience that matches exactly what we've had around the message amen where he walks with a prophet he looks to a prophet he's called and commissioned by a prophet amen and he loves that prophet's Ministry he's drawing from that Ministry and all of a sudden God takes that Prophet off the scene amen and Elisha acts like any human being would act and he goes through a period of time he's just in mourning you don't see any power you don't see any Miracles you don't see any ambition all you see is wishing amen and he's crying out saying oh my father my father the Chariots of Israel the horsemen God why could why did you take the prophet why would you take your message off the Earth and not realizing he hadn't and friends we've had a long time around the message amen of of of of wondering of trying to figure out amen of saying what did Elijah tell us anyway amen what what was in that message anyway besides hunting stories and testimonies from 60 years ago and and and lifetime experiences and all those things which are wonderful amen but they don't don't do much to hold an individual today amen as far as their spiritual ceiling amen but then Elisha something begins to grow in his heart it begins to think about what Elijah's told him and Elijah was saying things about double portions it was saying things about the supernatural he was saying things about an Elisha Ministry amen sooner or later Elisha sooner or later Brad we gotta take this mantle up amen and don't be afraid strike the water and you can expect that the Lord God of Elijah will be the same God today you got to take on that mantle brother random told you he said their mantle of a doctor that the power amen The Authority the government would be on his shoulders amen and the shoulders not the head the shoulder's not the eye of the Seer it's a body amen and how many believe in a body Ministry how many believe the god of William Brown's the God today still does the supernatural amen you of all people I know you agree with me amen that we will see Miracles we have seen Miracles amen God is God is real his promises are true Hallelujah a body Ministry brother Bram said that's where the real Church speaks in his power that's where the apostolic power returns to the church when the government shall be upon his shoulders he said there's come in a real Church there's coming a real church I say there's never been a day like this day I believe in that this is just me and uh and and you can go with me if you want to amen but I believe this day this quote is fulfilled amen that there is a church on the face of the Earth that understands amen not only what God has done but understands what God is doing understand that she has a position understand she has Authority understand she has power brother Branham called you the Queen of Heaven amen it's time to exercise your rights time to exercise your Authority your power you're Royal you're a royal seed amen it's a promised day amen but see it's got to be by a real Revelation I want you to notice when Joshua amen Joshua in in Deuteronomy 31 he's commissioned by Moses he actually hears the commission you know not out of the sky but it comes from Moses it's Moses his own voice calls him in Deuteronomy 31 and says Joshua come here he says be strong in a good courage because I because you've been chosen to lead the people into the land and you're going to be the fulfiller of it amen and so what a wonderful thing that would have been a good day to be in church when Moses prophesied that over Joshua I would have liked to been there amen but see when Joshua when we come to Joshua chapter 1 it doesn't say Moses said it doesn't say brother branham's head but it says these words the Lord spake unto Joshua and brother sister until this message becomes more amen than mechanical words on a tank it's got to be the voice of God speaking to you amen commissioning you for a work today amen by a divine revelation that's what it takes not an intellectual conception not a bunch of dry theology God didn't send a message to make you a a Pentecostal with slightly better Doctrine he didn't send it to make you a Baptist with slightly Freer worship amen but he sent you a word amen a perfect word amen to put you on a Capstone position of power amen and the Holy Ghost is here to reveal it that it's to you it's your calling it's your commission it's your message just amen but one of these days shouldn't we ought to believe it Allelujah amen it wasn't the voice of Moses it was the voice of God Amen that's what happens when you flip on a tape you say rapturing faith lays on the tapes if I say it's got to come off sometime and get into the heart of a of a Rapture people amen bird will produce Resurrection Life resurrection power quickening power amen that's what we're living in you won't do that and under your under this human nature under this first birth Joshua couldn't either when Joshua was born his mama named him Hosea it's a beautiful name it means it means savior savior even even from birth there was an expectation that was put on Joshua to be a child of Destiny he was Moses's right-hand man he had a position of authority people looked to him he was a heroic figure even then but he couldn't take one into land like that amen but actually under the ministry of Moses Joshua had to have an experience and you got to have the same experience and every one of our young people have got to have the same experience amen when Moses calls him forth he says Joshua your name's not hoshea anymore but you're yeah amen which is not just a savior but it's God the Savior and what he did was he took a Divine element He took it he took part of his own God took part of his own nature his own identity his own name and he put it into Joshua's character and that overwrote all the weakness of his first birth amen Joshua never could have been a savior but by the Divine element brother sister and how could you ever take a Rapture I'll tell you how by a divine element we are partakers of the divine nature and God Amen has ruled out the Dynamics of the Holy Spirit poured it into this church amen to Quicken Amen to purge you of all of your first birth he said I don't call you a church anymore I call you bride you are sinless you are spotless it's just as if you never did it in the first place hallelujah amen don't look at your nature anymore don't look at your name don't look at your background it ain't about what kind of a family you came out of amen amen what kind of family did you come out of brother Ron real high noble people real intellectual real wealthy real famous amen don't look at that amen but the Divine element purges that amen amen his nature washes our old man away amen and we're translated into the kingdom of his dear son all things are passed away all things are become new hallelujah amen and one one day you see you see a weakling you see amen one day you see a Christian just struggling caught in this cycle amen but bye that Divine element amen a sinner becomes a saint a weakling a Stripling becomes a champion amen a little boy becomes a giant slayer Hallelujah by the Divine element friends that's what we're trusting in it's the Divine element that will cause you to give a good report amen because once you receive that Divine element you'll look at a giant you'll call it a grasshopper you look at a mountain you call it a molehill not cause you got the power to overcome it but because there's a Divine element something on the inside that says I'm able I'm called I'm commissioned for this brother Bram said the only way you overcome is by Holy Ghost baptism all that's under the shed blood is Overcomers because you can't overcome yourself but it's he that overcome for you amen what are you and I friends we're just a little Rahab amen who had no power to save herself she didn't come from anything special there was nothing about her amen that that would cause anybody to to look with admiration or or honor amen but she had one thing a token amen and the token and Joshua loved the token because the token is what allowed Joshua to be a savior it's one of all friends amen you and I have got a token amen it's not by might it's not by power but it's by an identification amen when I see the blood over you amen I won't let judgment pass over you I've already accepted you you can't do it yourself see that's the problem many times in a Christian Life say brother Nathan I need save from this I need save from that all right who's doing the saving who's doing the saving Hosea he's saying oh I'm Hosea I'm supposed to be the bride and I'm supposed to be in that Invincible Army and I'm supposed to live so high the devil doesn't know what to do with me and amen that's all great amen but who's doing the saving amen it's not Jose the Savior but it's God the Savior amen the Joshua the holy spirit amen gave you a token brother sister you'll survive this thing you'll overcome this thing Hallelujah he's married you right into this overcoming lineage what a blessed message I say with God we're more than able to take the land I say with God we're more than able to do you say brother Nathan after all these years you really think the message is going to survive think the churches are going to hold together you think the Revival is going to go on you think there's any hope for the for the for the new generation I got more hope now than I've ever had I'm more excited now this is the the depths of my heart brother's sister I'm more excited about what God's doing right now than I've ever been in my life amen cause I see the commission I'm not looking at the circumstances hey man why I've been listening to some calebs I I don't we appreciate a Caleb Ministry amen somebody who stayed true over over many years and held their heads above Winds of Doctrine and amen men that never looked at the circumstances they just looked at the promise and I thank God for brother Ron I believe he's a Caleb amen I've been raised up under a Caleb Ministry that type of ministry Brother Ray amen stay true to the message didn't try to insert himself into it just believed it just expected it to manifest itself didn't look at all the nonsense didn't get embroiled up in all the and all those things I say thank God for a Caleb amen when you find a real Caleb you stay with that guy he's gonna put you on your Mountain he's gonna put you on your Mountain and just time you think he's done he ain't done until we're all on our Mountain yes sir amen yours last Hallelujah that's scriptural amen amen you see I find that God had to raise up a Caleb he couldn't let a bunch of young guys go running into the land Helter Skelter he'd had to have a Caleb there Amen to lead the charge amen and Caleb the great thing about Caleb Caleb doesn't diminish in power he only grows in power why because he's not looking at the natural things he's looking at the promise and brother sister the longer you look at the promise the stronger you get amen the more able you be you are amen we're not getting weaker Church the message isn't getting weaker just look at it amen just quote it just believe it don't worry about what everybody else says amen takes a Caleb Caleb says give me my Mountain that's a bride mentality that's a bride mentality a Mountain's not an easy place to live amen but but it's hard to live up on that Capstone level it'd be easy to be down here on simple faith and maybe a little virtue maybe a little or or some people hit knowledge and they never got any farther amen but Caleb said no he said I don't want a valley put me on a mountain there's a mountain with my name on it I wonder you know Caleb was a real Warrior and I was just thinking about this and you could take it for what it's worth but I wonder if Caleb being a man just born for the battle he's a real Warrior he he might have known something he might have seen something down through history you could you look at history and there was this great you know great region of of of of prosperity and fertility down there and at the Tigris and the Euphrates down in that Sumerian value right and and out of that Valley came this big Empire of Sumerians and they live right on the river and everything came easy and it grew just naturally and everything was great and that was great for the Sumerians until the acadians came because the acadians lived up in the mountain and a mountain and a rough living on a mountain but rough living makes rough men and so what those rough men did they came and they kicked the Sumerians out of the valley and then the then it became the Acadian Empire well then the Acadian Empire got a little soft and come down comes the Babylonians and the Acadian Empire becomes the Babylonian Empire amen until the medes and the Persians come down out of the mountains you see the pattern amen because Hard Times makes hard men and hard men make good times good times make soft men soft men make hard times I know you've heard it so amen that's how Caleb knows that he says listen he said I'm not going to stay in no Valley but put me and my family put me in my church put me and my people way up as high on that mountain as we can get we want a Capstone love we want Capstone power we want Capstone word up on that mountain amen because if I put my church there I know that that my that when the enemy comes to try to take something away from us amen then it won't just be me being a warrior my son will be a warrior my grandson will be a warrior my children and their children and their children will be strong in the battle why because I put them on a mountain [Music] brother sister where is the Bride of Jesus Christ of this hour with a cry in a heart to say give me my Capstone Let It Be My Reality let it be in my position let it be my commission let it be my inheritance let it be fulfilled in my life put me up on that mountain Hallelujah not a valley that comes easy hallelujah thank God for Caleb's because for every Caleb we've had and we've had 10 other guys politicians you know older Sons of their father's house and and you know and and and and and guys raise up you know out of dathan Accord type lineages and Ted there were 10 of those guys saying there ain't no way like yeah we believe the supernatural but don't ask us to lay hands on the sick I mean you know I because there's Giants there's a an excuses oh you know well someday someday one of these times around the Wilderness you know that Revival will finally come and we'll be able to cross over won't that be great when that happens you know someday when everybody when we get everybody in my church under my teaching and uh oh you know well well you know I thought we might have been about ready for that milk and honey but then I preached false Doctrine somebody corrected me and now there's no love in the body hey man give me a Caleb hey man Caleb too busy he I think Caleb it's not he doesn't say much in the scripture I think he was more of a man of action amen he said forget what you guys said didn't you hear what Moses said he said we're promised a land of milk and honey and I'm gonna go now you come if you want to but I'm going in Hallelujah amen and it's our time brother sister it's Joshua time it's not coming it's here amen you can taste the milk and honey of this message it's a living reality it's available it's happening all around you don't miss it amen amen don't be trying to get by in that old man I get some of this corn Hallelujah in this land there were a lot of people walking Moses but they didn't go on with his message brother Bram said this and this is just quite an amazing and again I'm just thinking about this Young Generation God's raising up and really where my heart is and passion of my Ministry but here's Caleb and Joshua saying we're more than able to do it is this all right tonight amen we're more than able to do it why he said because they were looking at God's promise not what the circumstances but then there's all the old Fighters all the old Fighters right amen uh many and now brother bran said something that chills me to the Bone about the old Fighters he said did God bless them sure boy that shook me he blessed them they wandered about they married wives they planted Vineyards they had babies and they increased they'd done good in the wilderness amen they done good but they weren't in full blessing brother sister I don't plan I'm spending 50 60 years of my life wandering around in this message just to get married and have babies and build a church and a career I want to live in full blessing I'm tired of the nonsense tired of the politics amen but God I'm I want to get behind my Caleb and I want to go into this thing and see what's laying there for me I want to see the fullness of it I want to experience the riches of it I want the reality of it I want to see the supernatural I want to see Revival strike our young people I want to see lives change I want to see the sick healed I want to see the captive bound I want to see a living God I want to I want to drink the milk I want to eat that honey I want to live in full blessing that's a very Cry of my heart brother sister it is so easy to settle for just a simple Christian Life as a church member joining a social group associating yourself with the message amen amen but you're not saved by calling yourself a message believer the token's not over you because you've got the picture of the Prophet on your wall there's one name given under Heaven whereby men may be saved you got to be born into that name or you'll never live in full blessing you'll have a nice life you'll have a nice wife you'll have nice children good Fellowship Good Times but I want to live in full blessing and I believe there's a people on the earth now that it's a very Cry of their heart put me on that mountain the giant somebody else failed to kill give me a chance that stronghold that's never been torn down it's time amen put me on my mountain I'm in the Valley of the shadow of death but I'm on my way to a Mountaintop Hallelujah I want to live in full blessing I want to live a full blessing Hallelujah amazing actually Moses tells them he says he talks about the old Fighters none of them went in but he said listen he said your little ones your little ones and which you said would be a prey you said they'd be a prey but then will I bring in and they shall know the land which you have despised I just got to think about that brother Andrew amen that we had people you know that there were people the Lord was supposed to come in 1977. we weren't supposed to be here and some of you old enough to remember the Perugia Doctrine going around saying well he came off The Mercy Seat in 1963 and none of our children are going to be able to be saved and all those things amen that's what the old Fighters were talking about amen we weren't supposed to be here and these young people weren't supposed to be here hallelujah amen but God's raised up a generation Against All Odds Hallelujah by his own hand he's formed up the greatest generation of young believers that's ever lived and they're gonna sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord I'll be the first one to testify this generation has a quality My Generation didn't have amen but why because this message doesn't go like this amen it goes like this amen God is elevating the thing don't you get discouraged if you're looking for negativity there's plenty to be found but if you just look right in front of your nose you see what God is doing amen the bride's Revival's in full swing amen with full power with full benefits thank you there's a supernatural being leading each one into their positional placing until we come to the fullness of adoption which is a very changing of this body we weren't supposed to be here I just love that you know David David was supposed to be the one David had on his heart it was his vision it was his desire to see the house of God's worship restored he believed in a message of restoration he believed in the work it was his cause he he wanted it amen he wanted to produce it but there were blood on his hands there was blood on his hands so what does he do he turns to a new generation amen he says Solomon he said and he gives him the Joshua commission he says Solomon be strong and of a good courage amen for the Lord has selected you to prepare him house hallelujah amen we've had a lot of old Fighters there's a lot of people amen a lot of men piled up on the scrap heaps and things a lot of blood that has been shed brother sister but don't you lose hope amen there are greater than Solomon is still here amen and he has restored himself a body Temple amen we're his people amen can get together and not just talk about God and again the things that he did historically amen but they can experience the atmosphere and the power and the reality of the Shekinah glory amen why because the greater than Solomon raised up to restore a house of worship that's what this message is friends it's a restored worship amen it's a restored belief with restored power and restored Authority amen it's got Apostolic power it's got Peter Authority it's got Eden power it's got Eden creation it's got Eden rights amen it's been restored a house a house where the pillar of fire dwells amen the same pillar fire that led Moses out it led Joshua in say brother Nathan a pillar of Fire I don't remember that in the Book of Joshua it was there it was in the ark amen so maybe not everybody saw it maybe not everybody witnessed it with their own physical eyes but they saw the power of it amen and the ones that believed in it when it moved you better believe they moved with it they weren't going to stay behind in the wilderness amen when that thing hit the Jordan they were right behind it brother sister and everywhere it went Victory went brother sister what is the Ark of God's presence today I say it's not a building it's not a construction it's not a piece of woodwork amen but it's you amen amen he said his glory is not behind Badger skins anymore but he chose an ark and you look at your Humanity you say how could it be amen because he took the wood of your humanity and he covered it with his deity he poured out the gold of his own self onto the bride Amen to make you the Tabernacle of his presence so wherever you go power goes wherever you go amen Miracles go wherever you go Victory goes cause you're the ark amen ain't that what a message came to tell us hallelujah there's a tabernacle presence and it's leading us into our adoption brother bran said we're entering the Rapture age now the church can't go it's in in its condition so if I were you I'd quite waiting for all the churches to get it right he said the church can't get can't go in its condition and it can't get any better amen it's got to get worse it's got to be something and it's moving right now it's moving right now he said the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's the saith the Lord thus saith the Lord you say oh my brother Nathan when's the Rapture going to come we're already in it he said we've entered the at the Rapture age and the bride amen has a move amen so wherever you're at brother sister I don't know what conditions you're in but I know where you're headed amen you're headed for a Rapture cause you're in a Rapture rage amen you're you've got to wrap your life the resurrection powers in you it's that Pillar of Fire leading you amen so we can't just wander around the mountain of God sent a prophet there's got to be a general Joshua generation amen this message is not to just be talked about he didn't send a message so we could stand out in the parking lot and swap quotes and blow somebody's mind and prove how spiritual we are this message is supposed to be believed it's supposed to be lived live touch it I say if not us then who if not now then when thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride amen that means you can move you can get right up pull up those 10 Stakes you might have been in that condition for 50 60 years but you got a right to rip up uh rip up your tense takes and move with this message amen cause it's never stopped it's still going forward you don't have to stay where you're at get up and move or be to God Hallelujah the pillar fire is moving the Overcomers are moving with it amen he said kanan's not the Millennium it's the age of the Overcomer oh the dispensation of overcoming Hallelujah now what's the land that's promised to the believer the promise is the Holy Spirit and how do you find that your position in that land you got to be born for it you got to be born for it my goodness I gotta hurry amen but you've got to be born for this now all these all these overcoming children of Israel amen they they were born under a name that that predestined them amen that foreign them to possess a place in that land isn't that right when the sons of Israel were born their mother was preaching birth pains amen and in that wonderful message of birth pains she's calling names over these children amen and there was Judah and there was Simeon and there were all these all these all these sons and that name that they were born under friends amen see first of all you got to have a birth but then you've got to realize what that birth means amen when you're born you're born under Renee and the name doesn't have anything now they might have been down in Egypt when they were born but the name that didn't have anything to do with their Egyptian condition amen and they might have been wandering in the wilderness but that name wasn't talking about the Wilderness but at the time of birth amen there was a name given over them that said it don't matter where you came from it doesn't matter what kind of circumstances you're in you were born for something more there's a mountain somewhere with your name on it glory to God friends your destiny was spoken over you at your birth the Bible says we are predestinated unto adoption now are we the sons of God but there's a mountain amen there's a positional placing there's a Rapture waiting for you that's what the token tells you amen that's why you can rest under this token amen because it because that token amen God didn't put a token over them just to say well they'll they'll do well in Egypt and they'll get by he put a token over them because he said they'll never fall under Egyptian Dominion because I've already got a land in mine I've got a place I want to take him to oh my I wish I had time to preach Hallelujah amen the spirit Bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God Amen that's that that that is the message we've received a message of adoption which has given us the power and the right and the authority to be what God said we would be amen what amen we're in the final work of redemption in the doesn't the Bible talk about a great valley and it's got there he one of the Prophet saw a great big valley and there was a huge Army in it but it was bones dry and dead so what does he do he commands the prophet he says Pro send forth a prophecy send him three works of redemption he said he said he and so Ezekiel prophesies and what happens a message of justification comes over those bones and sinew begins to grow on those Dry Bones then comes a message of sanctification amen and and flesh wraps around the sinew amen and then he sends a restoration the gifts and the baptism the Holy Ghost off of Azusa Street and skin covers it over amen like the shelter of those Pentecostal leaves and amen everything's great you got a valley full of strong men with restored bodies and amen and and a strong looking mighty looking Army but they're dead and they don't have the power Amen to possess what they were raised up to possess so what does God do amen he says Ezekiel prophesy one more time amen send another prophecy over the people amen and when he did God filled up his lungs with the Eastern wind amen and he breathed and he breathed into those bodies and they rose up Amen to be an invincible Army friends what this message is is the very Breath of God Amen to fill your lungs amen with life amen to turn an old Baptist or Methodist or Pentecostal into a living breathing Invincible overcoming Army of conquests Hallelujah the Bible says the breath came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet in exceeding great Army and he said I have opened up your Graves amen he's about to preach him an adoption message he says and I shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I'll place you in your own land brother sister I say let this prophet's message breathe life into you let it breathe life into you let it not just be the words of a man but God himself speak into your heart and breathing it into you the same way that that God breathed life in Adam the same way that Jesus breathed the Holy Ghost over the disciples Amen Let it breathe on you let the Breath of God fill your lungs amen amen we see our wayward children we see backsliders and we see prodigals amen and the situation looks impossible amen but there was a mother one time who knew about an Elijah Ministry where even when things looked impossible when it looked like it was past hope she knew a prophet had been in the land and if she could get her boy under that influence that Prophet amen could lay over that boy and breathe life back into a dead man amen there's a breath of life in this message Amen Let it breathe over you Hallelujah Moses comes to the Red Sea and there he is you know you know and on one side amen he's got the there's these wild crashing waves of fanaticism and on the other side is these stinking stagnant Waters of formalism and and Pharaoh didn't care which side they drowned in as long as he got him off amen he wanted to he wanted to run him into one or the other friends amen but what did do god do amen God took a great big breath of air and he breathed out that East Wind and it opened up a narrow way right down the middle brother sister between formalism and fanaticism amen I you say brother Nathan you afraid of getting off are you afraid this message is going to spin off this way or spin off that way I'm not afraid of amen cause I feel the Breath of God Amen I feel the Eastern wind blowing out of this message amen I hear my theophany whispering to me saying you step into that water and you'll walk through on dry ground and you'll go places where Satan can't follow you let it breathe on you let it fill your lungs amen amen it's hard to stand on a mountain some mountains are so high you don't even have the breath in yourself to stand there so what do you need you need an air supply and brother I I know this is simple preaching but the greatest Air Supply I know amen is the message of the hour amen when God told William Branham to prophesy again over a dead bunch of churches amen and when he prophesied God breathed life into the Bride of Jesus Christ and he said I've made you more than a conqueror you're an invincible Army and I'm going to put you in your adoption you're going to take a Rapture hallelujah hallelujah you got to breathe it you got to believe it I'm very near to close but oh think of it friends as I was with Moses so I will be with thee amen that he's still breathing over you he's still blowing on the waters to make a oh hit when the waters are troubled friends it's not just a rushing Mighty Wind but it's a breath of God pardon your obstacle parting your part pardon your your destruction and making a way for you to walk through it Hallelujah step into that water breathe that word climb out of that Valley live on that mountain kill that giant blow that trumpet take a big old breath Amen to this message air amen I'm breathe into that trumpet blow it for all it's worth amen he has no voice but our voice you say you say brother Nathan I'd love to know I'd love to know a living breathing God amen I know where he's at he has no voice but your voice he has no hands but your hands he's got no breath but your breath Hallelujah he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will it'll be given you amen see your commission to do it that's why Joshua under a commission it didn't matter what he ran into it didn't matter how impossible the situation that's why Joshua could stand there amen and in his in a dark hour in a in a heavy battle amen when he needed a little more light what did he do he spoke to the sun now you talk about now you talk about you talk about arrogance amen you talk about ambition amen when Joshua stand there and square his shoulders back say son stand still Right Where You Are amen sounds ridiculous amen but see there was a commission amen and so see here when you think about the scenario amen how perfectly it matches our day when Joshua was standing there right there at the evening time when it was getting really really dark and he's in a and he's in a battle just a pitch battle amen they're going all out fighting this war amen and Joshua's standing there and he needs just a little more light to overcome amen now if Moses was there Moses would have lifted his arms and everything would have been okay amen but Moses wasn't there with Joshua it was Joshua standing there fighting that battle so where did he find the light to overcome in the inside voice in the inside voice because Moses had breathed some things over Joshua and Joshua took it in and when he stood there he didn't lift His Hands to Heaven say God send Moses back no he knew there was a commission over him amen so he stood there no matter how ridiculous it looked and he ordered the sun to stand still hallelujah amen how could he do it he was commissioned to do it amen the inside voice just like brother Branham amen when he preached about the third poll he said there he was sitting in the woods and something inside an inside voice speaks to him he said not an audible but something inside said hey you know he'd already spoke to squirrels he'd already seen a lot of Supernatural enough that you and I might have packed up our bags and went home said let's call it a day let's quit while we're ahead amen but the inside voice said wait a minute you asked for three you asked for three amen amen you you've been through Falls you've been through fires but you asked for three amen any and and and and there in that moment he says okay I love the way the bread brand says it he says I'll make this one ridiculous I'll make this one ridiculous and he said there's going to be a squirrel he's going to pop out here he's gonna he's gonna run down and out on the branch and look over at that farmer he'll look back at me and I'll shoot it amen it didn't happen right away hey man you can't always get in a hurry with God but trust that Commission trust that Divine elements oh he sits there and he gives to God a little time to move all of a sudden what happens the squirrel pops up runs down the tree runs out the branch looks at the farmer looks back and he shoots it I say there's nothing too ridiculous for a third pole Church but if you say to this mountain be thou mood and cast into the sea you'll have what you asked for God breathes something into you but you gotta breathe it back it'll be your mountain and your voice amen and when that inside voice turns Up In You amen and that that and that courage that boldness begins to rise amen then don't look at the sun don't look at the Moon don't look at the doctor's report don't look at the circumstances trust that commission and speak speak the word of God Hallelujah amen the Bible says there never was a day before it or after I say until now that the Lord hearken until the voice of a man I say there's never been a day like this day God sent a message came down with a third pole Ministry and he handed a book out cracked wide open gave it to the Bride of Jesus Christ he said once you're done eating it and then you get through all that bitterness of of half an address holy and having to give up your old habits and having to leave you you know leave that denominational church and once you get through all that bitterness that honey that Canaanite honey amen's gonna settle way down in there something's gonna happen to you little bride there's going to be a boldness amen there's going to be breath begin to form in your lungs you're going to prophesy again you're gonna prophesy before many kings and Nations amen you'll give a call out to this world you'll say whoever whosoever will let him come if you're thirsty why don't you come Amen to the place amen where this where this where this adoption power is unfolding Hallelujah and I love how brother Brown could I have just a few more moments I I don't know what time it is I fear that I've kept you amen but I love how brother Brahm said when Joshua spoke to that son for that battle he said Moses lifted his arms as it were in other words Moses wasn't there physically but figuratively it was as it was the ministry and the power that was in Moses is continuing right on through Joshua amen because they defeated that enemy just as sure as if Moses had been there to raise his hands Hallelujah brother sister and I believe today that the son of man Ministry that did many miraculous things in the ministry of William Branham I believe that same son of man is here amongst his people today and he's still doing the supernatural he's still changing lives he's still calling people out he's still placing people Amen in their adoption amen the Sheaf is still waving amen but there's a whole crop amen of original sea that's coming into the age of harvest as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee amen and I want you to see that this battle that Joshua was fighting right down in the evening time all by himself amen maybe for a moment wishing that Prophet was there to show him the way amen it was not a two-sided struggle and when you read the Bible you'll find out it wasn't a hope so it wasn't Joshua needed a little more light or he might not make it oh God it wasn't off God doesn't sin you know I said give us a little something then we just won't be able to hold on now uh this is a little Michigan slang they were beating a snot out of those guys amen they were absolutely wiping the floor with that enemy and the only reason Joshua needed that last little bit of light amen the only reason he needed something to say Amen was so they could wipe that enemy off once and for all and they'd never have to worry about them again and their children would never have to worry about it again and their grandchildren would never have to worry about it again amen why why did God send Joshua an evening light right at the latest Tower right when it looked like it was too late amen because Joshua amen had to finish the job amen Moses did his job brother Branham did his job amen but Joshua amen and Caleb it's time to rise to your feet and speak to your obstacle and let's finish this thing you realize the victory that you're on the threshold you're on the threshold of the final defeat of the king of Terrors you are the generation that will that will exterminate death amen Paul ran the race but he went by way of the Grave Peter ran the race but he went by way of the Grave Amen brother Branham ran a good race but he went by way of the grave but when this Mortal shall put on immortality the Bible says then then now shall be brought to pass the saying death is swallowed up in Victory amen let's all stand the night and give the Lord Praise it's Victory Day amen victory you believe it amen amen God bless you church thank you for your long-suffering amen you're just a wonderful group to preach to amen won't you do it won't you speak to that mountain won't you speak to that mountain if you don't find the faith inside to do it I'll tell you what you do remember the law of Moses remember what brother Branham said meditate on a day and night play tapes in your home study it amen make it the focus of your life let it Breathe Into You and you'll find the more that this message breathes into you the more your lungs will begin to strengthen you you'll begin to exercise all of a sudden you'll find there's a voice speaking something different than it used to a change of confession a change of a perspective a change of reality you'll have to do it one of these days can't be anybody else it's your Mountain so it's got to be your voice brother Brown said a man will never live any higher or any further than what he believes he's living but friends you've got to believe this message you got to believe it's real it's true and it applies to you amen I believe it I believe that we're seeing it unfold I believe we're seeing the manifestation I believe we're right in the swing of the bride's Revival but one thing I know I want to be a part of it amen I want it to breathe out of me God bless you Saints amen you got something to say today you got something to say amen go ahead brother you are my champions [Music] foreign [Music] with God's face
