[47:58] your love we thank you for your mercy we
[48:01] thank you for your grace Lord It's Your
[48:04] Presence that we feel here tonight that
[48:07] that makes us feel at home because this
[48:10] world is definitely not our home and Le
[48:13] osy has its way of making us feel so
[48:16] sticky but Lord your presence washes us
[48:19] and makes us
[48:22] clean Lord one more time you have done
[48:25] it again in Lord where you have allowed
[48:27] us to enter into your shika Glory father
[48:30] to pull the veil behind us and know that
[48:32] the rest of the world really don't
[48:34] matter the things out there really don't
[48:37] matter but what matters is in this room
[48:39] and it's you
[48:40] father Lord I pray father for every
[48:43] person that would hear this tonight may
[48:45] they understand Lord that you're the
[48:48] most key part to every one of our Lives
[48:52] brother Brandon would say you're the
[48:54] principal theme of all the Bible you're
[48:56] the principal theme of our life father
[48:58] without you nothing matters father so
[49:02] father we press forward into this life
[49:04] knowing that you will never leave us nor
[49:06] forsake us and father tonight we commit
[49:09] this service into your hands Lord you
[49:11] see all the doings of Life father we
[49:14] just ask Lord for a special moment
[49:17] tonight in your presence Lord we
[49:19] surrender our life to you and I pray God
[49:22] you bless your word tonight and may it
[49:24] find its resting place in our heart so
[49:27] we commit this service into your hands
[49:30] in the name of Jesus Christ amen isn't
[49:33] it wonderful to be able to feel the
[49:35] presence of the Lord amen amen if you
[49:39] have your Bibles this evening I'd like
[49:41] to look over in the book of Isaiah
[49:43] chapter
[49:47] 53 Isaiah chapter 53 in John chapter n
[49:52] and and as you're aware there'll be no
[49:54] service tomorrow
[49:57] and uh we thank you for cooperating with
[49:59] us we just feel as a church body that we
[50:01] need to make a representation to the
[50:04] Reagan and Parker family and and they've
[50:07] asked our pastor to be a part of part of
[50:09] the funeral there and we know that we
[50:12] didn't get to see the healing that we
[50:14] all desired for our sister Erica but she
[50:17] got the
[50:18] healing she got the healing perfect
[50:21] perfect healing and also want to be
[50:23] remembering the brandom family with
[50:24] brother Billy Paul passing away and we
[50:27] see here that our loved ones are passing
[50:30] beyond the the veil and we know that God
[50:32] is coming and picking them up one by one
[50:35] we know that it isn't uh too much longer
[50:37] he's going to come and catch his waiting
[50:39] Bri away and Amen brother brandham says
[50:43] it like this in the church age book he
[50:45] said the angels are there waiting
[50:47] breathlessly for our arrival and to
[50:49] think that they're waiting there for us
[50:52] and to know that here we are we feel so
[50:55] sorry we you know for ourselves we hated
[50:58] to see sister Erica pass the way she
[51:01] did but I'd say that she's the one that
[51:03] feels sorry for us today and you know if
[51:07] she could encourage us I'd say that
[51:09] she's a part of that cloud of witnesses
[51:11] that is encouraging us to press the
[51:13] battle with everything that's within us
[51:15] so so just be remembering the the Reagan
[51:18] and Parker family there and we know that
[51:21] a void of a mother can't easily be
[51:22] filled but we know that Jesus heals
[51:24] every one of our our hearts amen amen so
[51:28] we have one service here this weekend
[51:30] and so I'm going to ask that you put
[51:31] everything that you've got into this
[51:33] service tonight and and I believe the
[51:35] Lord's got something in store for us
[51:37] here tonight Isaiah chapter 53 and verse
[51:40] one and the Bible said who hath believed
[51:43] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[51:46] Lord uh of the Lord revealed for he
[51:49] shall grow up before him as a tender
[51:51] plant and as a root out of dry ground he
[51:55] no form nor cess and when we shall see
[51:59] him there is no beauty that we should
[52:02] desire him he is despised and rejected
[52:05] of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted
[52:08] with grief and we hid as it were our
[52:11] faces from him he was despised and we
[52:15] esteemed him not surely he hath borne
[52:18] our griefs and carried our sorrows yet
[52:20] we did esteem him stricken smitten of
[52:23] God and Afflicted but he was wounded for
[52:25] our transgressions he was bruised for
[52:28] our iniquities the chastisement of our
[52:31] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[52:35] we are healed John chapter 9 and verse
[52:50] 1 and the Bible says here that as Jesus
[52:54] passed by he saw a man which was blind
[52:58] from his birth and his disciples asked
[53:01] him saying master who did Sin this man
[53:05] or his parents that he was born blind
[53:09] and Jesus answered neither hath this man
[53:12] sined nor his parents but that the works
[53:14] of God should be made manifest in him I
[53:18] must work the works of him that sent me
[53:20] while it is day the night cometh when no
[53:23] man can work and as long as I am in the
[53:26] world I am the light of the world when
[53:29] he had thus spoken he spat on the ground
[53:32] and made clay out of the spittle and he
[53:34] Anointed The Eyes of the blind man with
[53:37] the clay and said unto him go wash in
[53:41] the pool of Shalom which is by
[53:43] interpretation sent he went his way
[53:47] therefore and washed and came seeing may
[53:51] God bless his word you may be seated
[53:52] here tonight in the presence of the Lord
[53:55] I would like to speak to you tonight A a
[53:57] thought that that the Lord laid on my
[53:59] heart on Monday morning on exposing
[54:02] exposing the flaw exposing the flaw the
[54:06] word flaw it means it means a breach or
[54:09] a crack it is a defect that is made by
[54:12] breaking or splitting a gap or a fissure
[54:15] as we would say it's a flaw in a piece
[54:18] of China or a dish or a glass or or it
[54:20] could be a flaw in the in the drywall
[54:22] there and we know what Expos it means
[54:25] means to means to set before the public
[54:27] it means to disclose or to uncover it
[54:29] means to make bear to remove from
[54:32] anything that guards it and protects it
[54:35] and brother brandham said in the
[54:36] revelation of the Jesus Christ in the
[54:39] church age book he said now the Greek
[54:41] word for Revelation is apocalypse which
[54:44] means unveiling and he said this
[54:47] unveiling is perfectly described in the
[54:49] example of a sculptor unveiling his work
[54:52] of Statuary exposed in it to the
[54:55] onlooker it is an uncovering or a
[54:58] revealing what was previously hidden
[55:01] when so when we recognize that when
[55:03] Revelation strikes it unveils what was
[55:06] previously hidden and when brother
[55:08] brandham goes into the message of the
[55:11] Masterpiece he goes in there and he
[55:12] starts talking about a place that he's
[55:14] that he was there at Forest Lawn and he
[55:16] begin to he begin to look at the artwork
[55:18] that was there there at Forest Lawn he
[55:20] be to talk about different pieces of
[55:22] glass and different artwork he said God
[55:24] is in art and and brother brandham said
[55:26] that there he he said what what caught
[55:28] my mind or what caught my attention the
[55:30] most in Forest Lawn he said it was
[55:32] Michaelangelo sculpture of Moses and he
[55:36] said that he said that he had spent all
[55:38] of that time he spent countless years
[55:40] working on that sculpture just to get it
[55:43] exactly right he took this piece of of
[55:45] rock and he took it and and he worked on
[55:47] it tirelessly and he he worked on it
[55:49] through the nights and throughout the
[55:51] years and brother brandham said that
[55:53] after he had spent all that time for
[55:55] years and years to make this he said
[55:58] after he got under the influence of
[56:00] seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his
[56:02] heart and in his vision and desired to
[56:05] see he said it was and it and it was
[56:07] completed he said and when it was
[56:09] completed he was so inspired till he
[56:12] thought his own Masterpiece should speak
[56:15] back to him and he struck it across the
[56:18] leg and hollered speak and it made a
[56:20] flaw on it and it put a flaw on the
[56:23] image he said but to to me the flaw was
[56:26] what made it the Masterpiece we got a
[56:28] little bit of a ring here Brothers he
[56:30] said to me what made the flaw was to me
[56:34] what the flaw was what made it the
[56:36] Masterpiece to think that tonight that
[56:39] the flaw is what made
[56:41] Michelangelo's uh Mo of Moses the flaw
[56:45] was what made it the Masterpiece now
[56:47] brother brandom said now he said that's
[56:49] in my own opinion he said when he struck
[56:51] that when when Michelangelo Struck it he
[56:54] said to to me he said in my opinion he
[56:57] said that made it the Masterpiece you
[56:59] see there might be other people that had
[57:01] different thoughts of why it was a
[57:02] masterpiece but William brandham as a
[57:05] prophet speaking to us he said in my
[57:07] opinion he said it was the flaw that
[57:11] made the Masterpiece and to me it what
[57:13] is so amazing is that the flaw came
[57:16] after he matched the very image of what
[57:19] Michelangelo had in his mind that when
[57:22] he when he saw what he had held there in
[57:24] his mind for all of those years and
[57:26] looking at this thinking about it the
[57:28] inspiration that struck his mind as an
[57:30] artist to be able to bring it out to
[57:32] think that the flaw came after the image
[57:36] had met met met in his mind and then he
[57:39] therefore said speak to it you see it
[57:42] was the inspiration of seeing what he
[57:45] had had set there in his mind that was
[57:47] perfectly before him and to think that
[57:50] tonight as as the children of the most
[57:52] high God to think that tonight that that
[57:55] we have a promise here tonight that God
[57:57] has said that he would never leave us
[57:59] and that he would never forsake us but
[58:01] we know this that we have an aggressive
[58:04] enemy that is constantly at war with the
[58:07] saints of God because Satan knows that
[58:10] God cannot lie and that God is the
[58:12] author of all truth and that he realizes
[58:16] that there he was all the way back there
[58:18] in the Garden of Eden and he heard God
[58:20] talking about a seed that was going to
[58:22] come that God had made a promise that
[58:25] there would be a woman's seed and that
[58:27] he would bruise the head of the serpent
[58:30] and so Satan had been looking for that
[58:33] promised seed for all of those years and
[58:35] he constantly had watched for that seed
[58:37] he he'd watched for that woman seed to
[58:39] come you see because Satan knew that
[58:42] that seed would expose Satan's plans it
[58:45] would expose that there was a flaw in
[58:48] Satan's plans because he knew without
[58:50] that woman's seed that the serpent the
[58:53] Serpent's head would not be br Bruce so
[58:55] Satan was constantly watching for the
[58:58] woman's seed to come and to think that
[59:00] as we just draw a drama just for a
[59:02] moment that God that there he had it in
[59:05] his mind to create himself an Eden for
[59:08] his children to live in that God thought
[59:10] of these great things as a as a great
[59:12] sculpture as a great sculptor he he set
[59:15] out these things he had them in his mind
[59:17] he had a vision of what he was going to
[59:18] be brother brandham would say he said he
[59:20] had attributes to be a father attributes
[59:23] to be a Healer he said but he couldn't
[59:25] do that as the great God up in heaven he
[59:27] said so he had to create a man so he had
[59:30] to create all of these different
[59:31] elements of the world that we understand
[59:34] so God has all of these things as
[59:37] they're laid out in his mind and he
[59:39] brings them into manifestation that God
[59:42] then allows his child Adam to come into
[59:45] come into manifestation and he trust
[59:47] Adam so much that he allows him to
[59:50] control the things that God has created
[59:53] he he trust him so much that he allows
[59:56] his children to speak to the atmospheres
[59:58] like he spoke to the atmospheres he
[1:00:01] trust Adam and Eve so much that he
[1:00:02] allows them to decorate the Eden the way
[1:00:05] that they want it because they God has
[1:00:08] is setting them up and notice what they
[1:00:10] were operating in they were operating in
[1:00:13] the office of a son and daughter of God
[1:00:16] brother random would say it like this
[1:00:17] they were operating as amateur Gods but
[1:00:20] to think that Satan in his slick ways he
[1:00:23] slipped in and persuaded Eve to
[1:00:26] disbelieve the word of God to think that
[1:00:28] this was the only fortification that
[1:00:31] they had there in Eden was the word of
[1:00:33] God but Satan was so slicking away that
[1:00:36] he slipped in there that he made her
[1:00:39] disbelieve the word of God what was he
[1:00:41] trying to do he was trying to show her
[1:00:44] that she did not have full
[1:00:46] control he was trying to show her that
[1:00:49] she had not fully tasted of all that was
[1:00:51] laying there in the Garden of Eden so he
[1:00:54] tried to expose her to the tree of
[1:00:57] knowledge to make her come to an
[1:00:59] understanding that she did not fully
[1:01:01] have he was trying to put it in her mind
[1:01:03] to make a reason that she didn't have
[1:01:05] full control you see what Satan was
[1:01:07] wanting to do to Eve he was trying to
[1:01:09] point out an imperfection in her life as
[1:01:12] Humanity he was trying to show her that
[1:01:15] there was more for her but God had put
[1:01:17] restraints around it because God had put
[1:01:20] some things there but Satan on the
[1:01:22] backside of it was trying to cause a
[1:01:25] flaw and notice what it did because of
[1:01:27] her unbelief it caused a flaw what did
[1:01:30] it do it caused a Chasm to be to be
[1:01:33] caused the flaw to be com into into
[1:01:35] existence and there we recognize that in
[1:01:38] the Garden of Eden as soon as man had
[1:01:40] realized that he had sin that instead of
[1:01:43] running to God and saying God I'm sorry
[1:01:45] I fail I made a mistake I I I made a
[1:01:48] mistake I I I did wrong but instead of
[1:01:50] that what did he do he went out and he
[1:01:52] made himself a homemade religion instead
[1:01:54] instead of going to God say God I'm
[1:01:55] sorry I failed you I got a flaw in my
[1:01:58] inheritance I got a flaw in my
[1:02:00] possession but instead of that he made
[1:02:02] himself a homemade religion and we know
[1:02:05] good and well that a homemade religion
[1:02:06] will never work a man-made religion will
[1:02:09] never work is that right is that right
[1:02:12] notice brother random said that that
[1:02:13] homemade religion worked as long as they
[1:02:16] were not in the presence of almighty God
[1:02:18] but how can you escape the presence of
[1:02:21] the all knowing god that they could not
[1:02:23] Escape it but you see when God come
[1:02:25] walking down in the cool of the Eden
[1:02:27] like he had always done Adam knew that
[1:02:30] something was wrong he knew that
[1:02:32] something was wrong but instead of
[1:02:34] uncovering it he tried to cover his sin
[1:02:38] and his figle his figleaf religion
[1:02:40] didn't do him no good so God being a God
[1:02:43] that was rich in Mercy he made himself a
[1:02:46] substitute he made him a covering what
[1:02:50] was the covering it was the covering of
[1:02:52] the blood of Jesus of the blood of the
[1:02:54] Lamb that allowed
[1:02:56] them to be in Fellowship not in the way
[1:02:59] that they once was in the Garden of Eden
[1:03:02] but now they could actually have a
[1:03:04] fellowship because of the Fall there was
[1:03:06] no Fellowship but God was in the his
[1:03:09] idea was to restore the
[1:03:12] fellowship the fellowship that he had in
[1:03:14] his mind the fellowship that he really
[1:03:16] wanted the fellowship that he created
[1:03:19] Adam for God was restoring that you see
[1:03:23] that's what brother random would say the
[1:03:24] Masterpiece he said God is not the kind
[1:03:26] of art artist that would allow his
[1:03:29] greatest Masterpiece to lay their face
[1:03:31] down on the ground he said when he saw
[1:03:33] it Fallen he began to build it to make
[1:03:36] it and to bring it right back up again
[1:03:39] you see that's what makes God God to me
[1:03:42] is that he's so much God he's so big
[1:03:45] there is nobody that can explain how big
[1:03:48] he is but he's so great that he can
[1:03:50] humble himself and come to little old
[1:03:53] me but to think that there they were
[1:03:56] they were fortified by the word of God
[1:03:58] brother BR would saying it like this he
[1:03:59] said they were barricaded by the very
[1:04:02] word of God to think that tonight that
[1:04:04] you're barricaded by the word of God but
[1:04:07] what did Sin do it brought in a castle
[1:04:10] but the blood was a substitute it was a
[1:04:13] substitute of the blood that made for
[1:04:16] them an access because of the chasm that
[1:04:19] had been brought because of sin but you
[1:04:22] notice that I'm just going to jump real
[1:04:23] quick but you notice that when Jesus
[1:04:25] starts talking about about the Rich
[1:04:27] Young Ruler in Luke chapter 16 he starts
[1:04:30] talking about the Rich Young Ruler that
[1:04:32] there's two people in the picture when
[1:04:34] Jesus starts talking about Lazarus which
[1:04:36] was a beggar and he starts talking about
[1:04:38] the Rich Young Ruler that this one had
[1:04:40] much in his life but this one didn't
[1:04:42] have anything in his life but they both
[1:04:44] go beyond they both die but notice that
[1:04:48] when when when notice the scene that
[1:04:50] Jesus is bringing before us that there
[1:04:53] he begins to set it out and he says to
[1:04:55] him he said and he begins to look at it
[1:04:57] and there the Rich Young Ruler his eyes
[1:05:00] are looking over there and he sees
[1:05:02] Lazarus there in the bosom of Abraham
[1:05:05] and here the richr ruler he simply
[1:05:08] requests Lord let Lazarus come and take
[1:05:12] of the water and put it on my tongue for
[1:05:15] this this heat these Flames they're
[1:05:17] tormenting me but notice what the Bible
[1:05:20] said that Jesus said that Abraham said I
[1:05:22] cannot come to you and you cannot come
[1:05:25] to me because there's a great Gulf
[1:05:27] between you and I brother brandom said
[1:05:29] right there put a silence to Purgatory
[1:05:31] right there that there was nobody that
[1:05:34] could pay for your sin once they'd
[1:05:35] already went there once they done they'd
[1:05:38] under went to the Grave there was nobody
[1:05:40] that could go in there and pay a
[1:05:42] Catholic priest to get them back out of
[1:05:44] that
[1:05:46] Purgatory but notice what Abraham said
[1:05:48] to the Rich Young Ruler because you
[1:05:50] didn't receive God's provided weight
[1:05:53] because you wasn't willing willing to
[1:05:54] give it all up in this life what did he
[1:05:56] have he had the riches of life he had
[1:05:58] Potentials in this life but he wasn't
[1:06:00] willing to surrender it all to him he
[1:06:03] wasn't really you know he was wasn't
[1:06:05] really willing to give it all up for him
[1:06:08] to come fully and surrender him what did
[1:06:10] Satan do he robbed the Rich Young Ruler
[1:06:13] of the greatest opportunity that he had
[1:06:16] in his
[1:06:17] life that's exactly what Satan does to
[1:06:20] our young people he tries to rob them of
[1:06:22] the greatest opportunities that they've
[1:06:24] ever had in their life and that's access
[1:06:26] to the blood of Jesus Christ he tries to
[1:06:29] offer them some other way of living or
[1:06:31] some easy living or some easy believism
[1:06:33] of just anybody confess Jesus and all of
[1:06:36] these things what does he do he robs
[1:06:39] them he robs him of the greatest
[1:06:41] opportunity that they ever could have
[1:06:43] but to have a real surrender there's got
[1:06:46] to be a death and the Rich Young Ruler
[1:06:48] was not willing to completely die out
[1:06:52] but notice what the Young Ruler said let
[1:06:55] Lazarus go from the grave and go back
[1:06:58] there and testify to my five brothers
[1:07:00] let him go back there and testify to him
[1:07:03] don't you come down here don't you go
[1:07:05] beyond this Castle don't you go there
[1:07:08] but Abraham said no that's why they got
[1:07:10] the prophets that's why they got Moses
[1:07:13] notice what Abraham is telling him that
[1:07:16] there is an authority in the land to
[1:07:18] keep them from
[1:07:20] this don't you understand that that's
[1:07:23] what the word is it is the authority in
[1:07:25] the land to keep you from the chasm of
[1:07:27] sin that the word is a Chasm that you
[1:07:30] have need of to keep you from the
[1:07:32] bondage of
[1:07:33] hell he said not even if one came from
[1:07:36] the grave and went back there and talked
[1:07:38] to them not even that would persuade
[1:07:40] them he said if they he said not even
[1:07:42] that he said if they won't hear the
[1:07:44] prophets he said they won't hear one
[1:07:46] from the dead but I want you to know
[1:07:48] that if you can take this word if you
[1:07:51] can take this promise it'll expose every
[1:07:54] secret sin in your life it'll destroy
[1:07:56] Satan it'll annihilate his kingdom it'll
[1:07:59] bring healing to your body it'll bring
[1:08:02] joy to your soul if you can take this
[1:08:04] kind of word it'll bring peace to you
[1:08:05] like a
[1:08:07] river if you can take this word and let
[1:08:10] it cross your life let it roll across
[1:08:13] you if you can take this word it'll
[1:08:16] destroy every antic that Satan's got
[1:08:18] against
[1:08:19] you the word is everything that you have
[1:08:22] need of in this life amen now notice
[1:08:24] what brother random said he said have
[1:08:26] you ever noticed how Satan hates two
[1:08:28] books of the Bible I know you know this
[1:08:30] but I want you to hear the perspective I
[1:08:32] want you to stay in line with it tonight
[1:08:34] he said have you ever noticed how Satan
[1:08:36] hates two books of the Bible through
[1:08:38] though through Le liberal theologians
[1:08:40] and pseudo scientists he is always
[1:08:43] attacking the Book of Genesis and the
[1:08:45] Book of Revelations he said in both of
[1:08:47] these books we find Satan's origin his
[1:08:50] awful ways and his destruction he said
[1:08:52] that is why he attacks them he hates to
[1:08:56] be
[1:08:58] exposed and in those books he is exposed
[1:09:01] for exactly what he is he said Jesus
[1:09:03] said about Satan he has no part in me
[1:09:06] and I have no part in him and the devil
[1:09:09] would like to prove that different but
[1:09:11] he cannot so he does all he can to
[1:09:13] destroy confidence in the word but when
[1:09:15] the church disbelieves and believes when
[1:09:19] the church disbelieves Satan and
[1:09:22] believes a spirit of Revelation the word
[1:09:24] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:09:27] her when the church disbelieves Satan I
[1:09:31] want you to know right there that is the
[1:09:33] flaw in Satan's plan it's when the
[1:09:36] church disbelieves
[1:09:38] Satan every plan that he's got against
[1:09:40] you of sending you to a premature grave
[1:09:43] when you disbelieve Satan it's the flaw
[1:09:46] to its plan when you choose to turn down
[1:09:49] the devil's lie it is a flaw in Satan's
[1:09:53] plan Satan has planned out against you
[1:09:55] for 6,000 years but when you disbelieve
[1:09:59] him and you accept what the spirit has
[1:10:01] said about you Hallelujah when you
[1:10:04] accept the spiritual
[1:10:06] Revelation can I quote a prophet to you
[1:10:09] when you receive the spirit's Revelation
[1:10:12] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:10:17] you slap your neighbor don't slap them
[1:10:21] but tell them to wake up when you
[1:10:22] receive the spirit's Revelation the
[1:10:25] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against you
[1:10:27] do you realize how powerful that your
[1:10:30] belief is do you realize how powerful
[1:10:33] your amen is do you realize how powerful
[1:10:36] your agreeance
[1:10:38] is is when you disbelieve Satan but you
[1:10:42] believe
[1:10:44] God it puts you in line for a
[1:10:49] miracle I want you to know there's
[1:10:52] nothing outside of the word of God that
[1:10:54] you have need of for a miracle but to
[1:10:57] believe all you have to do is only
[1:11:01] believe Hallelujah you say well I don't
[1:11:04] believe Satan but you have allowed him
[1:11:06] to lead you to believe that you're no
[1:11:08] good you've allowed him to lead you to
[1:11:10] believe that you're not worthy enough
[1:11:12] you're not good enough you can't be
[1:11:14] healed you can't be delivered that the
[1:11:17] message don't work no
[1:11:19] more it's well I don't believe Satan but
[1:11:22] you allow him to trick you into thinking
[1:11:24] that you've got to deal with anxiety for
[1:11:26] the rest of your
[1:11:28] life well I don't believe Satan I don't
[1:11:30] believe his lies oh but when he puts a
[1:11:33] headache on you and he puts a feeling in
[1:11:35] your body and automatically he makes you
[1:11:38] think it's
[1:11:39] cancer you say well I don't believe
[1:11:41] Satan but you let you let one night slip
[1:11:44] by where you can't get in the presence
[1:11:45] of God and you feel like you're lost and
[1:11:49] you start believing the devil's lie
[1:11:51] you've allowed you've allowed sat to lie
[1:11:54] to you you've allowed Satan to tell you
[1:11:56] all kinds of things but I want you to
[1:11:58] know that God has told me
[1:12:00] opposite I am worthy I am good enough I
[1:12:04] can be healed I can be delivered I can
[1:12:07] be set free I am for the Rapture I am
[1:12:10] the
[1:12:16] message brother said I wish you could
[1:12:18] stand with me and see the faces of
[1:12:20] people when Satan knows that he's going
[1:12:23] to be exposed he said now it isn't that
[1:12:25] the people it isn't the people that I'm
[1:12:27] talking about he said it is that Satan
[1:12:29] has got a hold of them in their lives
[1:12:31] through sin and indifference and disease
[1:12:33] he said but you should see their faces
[1:12:36] that Satan knows he's going to be
[1:12:37] exposed and the most peculiar change
[1:12:40] comes over the people's countenance he
[1:12:42] said Satan is afraid he knows that the
[1:12:46] spirit of God is about to let the people
[1:12:48] know his Works he said that's why he
[1:12:50] hates meetings these meetings so much he
[1:12:53] said when names are called and diseases
[1:12:56] are revealed Satan hates it don't you
[1:12:58] see that it's the same way tonight under
[1:13:00] the fold Ministry that when when a man
[1:13:03] of God begins to preach the word of God
[1:13:06] and he starts calling out diseases and
[1:13:08] the word of God begins to discern the
[1:13:10] very thoughts and the intents of the
[1:13:11] heart what is it Satan gets afraid
[1:13:15] because he knows that if the people get
[1:13:17] the true revelation of the true church
[1:13:20] and what she is and what she stands for
[1:13:22] that she will be an invincible
[1:13:25] Army don't you understand that even
[1:13:28] though the prophet is not here that God
[1:13:30] ain't God's angel is here to direct the
[1:13:33] word to make sure that it doesn't miss
[1:13:35] its
[1:13:37] spot well Glory now notice what the
[1:13:41] Bible said in Ephesians 3 and9 to make
[1:13:43] all men let's say that together make all
[1:13:47] men see what is the Fellowship of the
[1:13:50] mystery which from the beginning which
[1:13:53] from from which which from the beginning
[1:13:54] of the world hath been hid in God who
[1:13:57] created All Things by Jesus Christ to
[1:14:00] the intent that that now under the
[1:14:03] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:14:05] places might be known by the church the
[1:14:07] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[1:14:10] Eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:14:13] Christ Jesus our lord so the purpose of
[1:14:15] this was to unveil it was to uncover it
[1:14:18] was to expose to every throne and to
[1:14:22] every rank of Angels and
[1:14:25] Demons of God's full riches and his
[1:14:28] wisdom towards
[1:14:32] you so The Fellowship of the mystery is
[1:14:35] to accept God's provided
[1:14:37] way and it is the only way to bridge the
[1:14:43] flaw every one of you here have flaws in
[1:14:47] your
[1:14:49] life and Satan Satan is waiting for the
[1:14:53] moment to expose your
[1:14:57] flaw if Satan could he would expose your
[1:15:01] flaw publicly before everybody
[1:15:06] here aren't you glad he
[1:15:10] can't but that's what he's looking for
[1:15:12] he's looking to expose the flaw of your
[1:15:16] of your
[1:15:17] Humanity but notice the only way to
[1:15:20] bridge the gap is to accept God's
[1:15:24] provided way now notice what brother
[1:15:26] random said and God hiding himself in in
[1:15:28] in
[1:15:30] Simplicity he said when man sinned he
[1:15:33] separated himself from God and crossed
[1:15:35] the great Chasm and put himself in death
[1:15:39] on this side and he's left there's no
[1:15:42] way back exactly there's no way for him
[1:15:44] to get back but then when he did you see
[1:15:47] you couldn't get back you couldn't get
[1:15:50] back on that side of the castle I want
[1:15:52] you to get a get a good visual of this
[1:15:54] tonight that you because of the fa that
[1:15:59] death and man was taken the same
[1:16:03] side on this side it's death on this
[1:16:06] side on this side it's death but on this
[1:16:08] side it's
[1:16:10] life you see you couldn't get back there
[1:16:13] was a Chasm between it that's what
[1:16:16] brother brandom said he said but God
[1:16:18] accepted a substitute which was a lamb
[1:16:20] or a goat or sheep or something for
[1:16:22] blood he said which Abel spoke of on the
[1:16:25] other side of the castle he said on that
[1:16:28] side he's a Son of God he's an offspring
[1:16:30] from God he's an inheritance of the
[1:16:32] earth he can control nature he can speak
[1:16:35] into existence why he's a Creator
[1:16:37] himself on the he's an offspring of
[1:16:41] God so on this side he has separated
[1:16:45] himself do you recognize if you're
[1:16:47] outside of the blood that you are on the
[1:16:50] side of
[1:16:52] death but on this side you are over here
[1:16:55] operating Under full Authority as a son
[1:16:59] and daughter of God that all the nature
[1:17:01] is waiting for the moment to for you to
[1:17:05] operate but because of the Fall there
[1:17:09] was a Chasm that was put there notice
[1:17:12] this he said but when he crossed he
[1:17:14] separated his sunship when he cross that
[1:17:17] Chasm he separated his sunship he's a
[1:17:20] sinner by Nature he's under the hands
[1:17:22] and minion of Satan and God took a
[1:17:25] sacrifice a chemical of the blood but
[1:17:27] the blood of bulls and goats did not
[1:17:29] divorce it it only covered
[1:17:32] sin it only covered sin he would say it
[1:17:36] like this he said if I've got a red spot
[1:17:38] on my hand and I cover with white the
[1:17:41] red spot's still
[1:17:43] there he said but God sent down from
[1:17:45] heaven a bleach for sin it was the blood
[1:17:49] of his own son that when I confess sin
[1:17:52] drops into God's bleach you try to find
[1:17:55] it
[1:17:56] again you take one of these little girls
[1:17:59] you take one of these prostitutes out
[1:18:01] there on the street and God turned them
[1:18:04] into a saint you tell me when they
[1:18:06] confess their sin try to find it
[1:18:10] again Satan would do all of his power to
[1:18:14] expose the flaw but the
[1:18:17] blood made away so that Satan
[1:18:21] cannot
[1:18:23] expose your
[1:18:25] flaws woo
[1:18:27] Glory he said the coloring of sin notice
[1:18:30] the coloring of sin goes back through
[1:18:32] the mediators and down through time
[1:18:34] until it hits the accuser Satan and lays
[1:18:37] on him to the day of
[1:18:39] judgment don't you understand why Satan
[1:18:42] does not want you confessing your sin
[1:18:44] and dropping it in the blood of Jesus
[1:18:47] Christ bleach because when you confess
[1:18:49] your sin when you confess you're not
[1:18:52] worthy when you you confess your
[1:18:55] faults when you confess you're not when
[1:18:58] you confess you've got flaws when you
[1:19:00] confess you're a
[1:19:04] human it goes back on
[1:19:07] Satan that's why Satan wants to keep you
[1:19:09] from praise that's why God that's why
[1:19:11] Satan wants to keep you from prayer
[1:19:13] that's why Satan wants to keep you from
[1:19:15] reading your
[1:19:17] Bible because the stronger you get the
[1:19:19] more you confess your sin the stronger
[1:19:22] the Heap of mountain of sin that is put
[1:19:25] upon
[1:19:27] [Applause]
[1:19:28] Satan don't you see the key element of
[1:19:31] the picture that if you confess your
[1:19:36] sin your sins are
[1:19:39] gone the
[1:19:42] moment how quick does it take brother
[1:19:45] Andrew let me show you how quick it
[1:19:47] takes brother brandom's in a prayer line
[1:19:50] he's dealing with he's dealing with
[1:19:52] patience
[1:19:53] and brother Brandon makes makes it very
[1:19:55] clear he said before you come into this
[1:19:57] prayer
[1:19:58] line you deal with your sin because if
[1:20:01] you don't get it dealt with it will get
[1:20:04] exposed
[1:20:08] here and this sister hears this and she
[1:20:11] steps out of line bows her head and says
[1:20:15] God forgive me steps back in line and
[1:20:17] walks before a prophet and she's found
[1:20:21] sinless how quick does does it take
[1:20:23] brother
[1:20:25] Andrew as soon as you can repent it's
[1:20:32] over Hallelujah you ain't got to beat
[1:20:34] yourself you ain't got to worry yourself
[1:20:37] you ain't got to go through life beating
[1:20:38] yourself trying to make yourself a
[1:20:40] Christian one time in the presence of
[1:20:43] the blood makes you white as
[1:20:47] snow well blessed be the name of the
[1:20:49] Lord every son and daughter of God knows
[1:20:52] what it's like to experience the freedom
[1:20:56] from
[1:20:58] sin but too many times people are not
[1:21:01] willing to give out the same Mercy that
[1:21:04] they
[1:21:07] retained oh come on
[1:21:11] somebody everybody's always quick to
[1:21:13] point out somebody else's fls or
[1:21:15] somebody else's mistakes but they dare
[1:21:17] not want their own flaws may put it into
[1:21:20] the
[1:21:21] public give the same Mercy that you want
[1:21:25] it doesn't matter who your last name is
[1:21:28] it doesn't matter what church you came
[1:21:29] from it doesn't matter where you are the
[1:21:32] blood is for every black man white man
[1:21:35] yellow man Red
[1:21:37] Man the blood is for every human human
[1:21:42] that sits
[1:21:46] here
[1:21:47] hallelujah well I fail but the blood
[1:21:50] says I'm perfect Satan says I can't get
[1:21:54] up but the blood Hallelujah the blood
[1:21:58] speaks of better
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:01] things I know you got a whole lot of
[1:22:03] things that's laying there in your
[1:22:04] family history that you could talk about
[1:22:06] but this Blood talks a whole lot better
[1:22:09] the blood speaks of better
[1:22:12] things there's a voice behind the
[1:22:16] blood what was it when Cain killed Abel
[1:22:20] he said I hear the voice of thy brother
[1:22:22] there's blood calling
[1:22:25] out now if Abel's blood has that much
[1:22:29] voice behind it how much more does the
[1:22:32] voice of the blood of Jesus Christ speak
[1:22:35] out and speak better
[1:22:38] things
[1:22:40] Hallelujah line up all your Devils line
[1:22:43] up every one of them line up all your
[1:22:46] mistakes line up all your
[1:22:51] flaws
[1:22:53] but I
[1:22:54] remember I remember
[1:22:57] falling but God
[1:23:01] don't but I remember sinning but God
[1:23:04] don't now let me ask you something whose
[1:23:07] memory do you
[1:23:11] want let me tell you something there's
[1:23:13] one thing I'm not gifted in a whole lot
[1:23:16] of ways but I am gifted in this way I
[1:23:19] never forget anything I'm like an
[1:23:21] elephant kind of like my mama we got a
[1:23:23] mind on us she ain't an elephant in that
[1:23:25] way but she's got the Lord have mercy
[1:23:27] that took a PL but but if you know the
[1:23:30] story about elephants elephants never
[1:23:33] forget I never forget anything it gets
[1:23:36] spoke to me one time I can remember
[1:23:41] it I don't want my
[1:23:45] memory that's right I don't want my
[1:23:50] memory I don't want my memory
[1:23:53] because my memory remembers mistakes my
[1:23:57] memory remembers faults my memory
[1:23:59] remembers when maybe you was out there
[1:24:02] my memory remembers maybe when you did
[1:24:04] me
[1:24:08] wrong but even if I forgive you I can
[1:24:11] still remember it but the power of God's
[1:24:15] memory he no longer remembers it it's
[1:24:19] not in his mind it's not in his mind
[1:24:22] it's not in his plan so when Satan says
[1:24:26] he's going to expose you say I take
[1:24:29] God's mind I take God's
[1:24:36] plan
[1:24:37] hallelujah
[1:24:40] hallelujah it was a gasm but you
[1:24:43] remember when brother Brandon when
[1:24:45] brother Brandon he's there in the seals
[1:24:48] and he said now I'm no longer going to
[1:24:50] address you as a church
[1:24:53] but I'm going to address you as a bride
[1:24:55] of Jesus Christ notice what he is doing
[1:24:58] I'm not going to address you as a church
[1:25:00] but I'm going to dress you as a bride
[1:25:02] because notice if you'll notice the
[1:25:04] language of the Prophet you see on that
[1:25:07] side of the seals the vision of the word
[1:25:09] showed a
[1:25:11] bridge but on this side of the seals the
[1:25:14] vision of the word shows that the CM is
[1:25:17] completely done away
[1:25:20] with let me say this to you that all the
[1:25:23] questions of life that Jesus is the
[1:25:25] answer when William Brandon preaches the
[1:25:28] message why in 1963 on the backside of
[1:25:32] the seals he said the your confessed sin
[1:25:35] he said completely does a away with the
[1:25:40] chasm you see you're not like the rest
[1:25:42] of the world that you can't get to God
[1:25:45] and God can't get to you the bridge has
[1:25:48] been bridged by the blood of Jesus
[1:25:51] Christ well somebody praise the Lord
[1:25:54] there is no more CM there is no
[1:26:01] Bridge what of it preacher I'm saying
[1:26:05] this that Jesus match the vision that
[1:26:10] God had before the foundation of the
[1:26:14] world surely if man has the ability to
[1:26:19] draw out things in his mind God has the
[1:26:21] ability
[1:26:23] and the Bible said that that the lamb
[1:26:25] was slain before you ever sinned that
[1:26:29] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[1:26:30] of the world and that that the Bible
[1:26:33] would tell us that when the vision of
[1:26:37] God came into manifestation and Jesus
[1:26:41] matched the inspiration of
[1:26:43] God the Bible said in John chapter 19
[1:26:47] that when the Roman soldier stuck his
[1:26:50] spear in his side what elements came out
[1:26:53] of it water and blood notice when you
[1:26:56] read all of John chapter 19 you'll
[1:26:59] notice that all the elements that that
[1:27:02] that that contribute to the New Birth
[1:27:05] come out in John chapter
[1:27:08] 19 water blood and the spirit when you
[1:27:10] read 1 John 5 and8 that this is that
[1:27:14] that these three agree in one it's water
[1:27:15] blood in spirit what is it it
[1:27:19] constitutes the new
[1:27:20] birth what happen happened in the Garden
[1:27:22] of Eden what happened God caused a deep
[1:27:25] sleep to come upon Adam and he took out
[1:27:28] of the side of Adam a rib and out of
[1:27:31] that side he brought forth his wife what
[1:27:34] happened to Calvary he matched the
[1:27:37] vision of almighty God he matched the
[1:27:39] vision of what he had in his mind and at
[1:27:43] Calvary that's why Paul would say in
[1:27:45] Galatians 2 and 20 I am crucified with
[1:27:48] Christ nevertheless yet not I but Christ
[1:27:51] that lives Within me I am co- crucified
[1:27:54] with him I'm identified with him in his
[1:27:57] death I'm identified with him in his
[1:28:02] Buel
[1:28:03] hallu
[1:28:06] Hallelujah he matched what God had in
[1:28:09] his
[1:28:13] mind
[1:28:16] hallelujah what happened to what
[1:28:18] happened to Calvary what happened in
[1:28:21] Eden he found himself a bride what
[1:28:24] happened to Calvary he took himself as
[1:28:27] bride out there you are water blood and
[1:28:32] spirit the only way that you cannot be
[1:28:36] identified in this is if the token is
[1:28:38] not applied to your life the only way
[1:28:42] that you are not a part of the master is
[1:28:45] if the token is not
[1:28:47] applied
[1:28:49] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:28:57] Hallelujah you
[1:29:01] imagine you imagine how God
[1:29:04] feels 2,000 years
[1:29:07] ago he waited for this
[1:29:10] moment he waited for this
[1:29:13] moment he was in David but David was not
[1:29:16] his
[1:29:17] fullness he was in Moses but Moses was
[1:29:21] not his fullness
[1:29:22] he was in Abraham but Abraham was not
[1:29:25] his
[1:29:27] fullness he was in all the prophets you
[1:29:29] can see Christ and all the prophets and
[1:29:33] the closest one there was was
[1:29:36] Joseph he matched him
[1:29:39] perfectly it matched them
[1:29:41] perfectly imagine as God is drawing us
[1:29:44] out brother Chris he's he's got the
[1:29:46] vision in his mind of Christ that all of
[1:29:48] these pieces are come
[1:29:50] together
[1:29:55] and he finally sees his vision
[1:30:00] manifested that when Jesus is up
[1:30:03] there on Mount
[1:30:05] Transfiguration what did he say this is
[1:30:07] my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
[1:30:13] dwell what was
[1:30:16] it Michelangelo could look at his
[1:30:18] inspiration he could see his vision
[1:30:20] manifested and he could cry speak back
[1:30:23] to it he could cry speak to it but he
[1:30:27] couldn't speak back to
[1:30:28] him but the
[1:30:30] vision of Christ had a voice and it
[1:30:35] could
[1:30:36] speak what was it speaking of that there
[1:30:39] was a
[1:30:41] people what was Jesus coming for he did
[1:30:45] not come here for himself he came here
[1:30:48] for
[1:30:50] you
[1:30:52] Hallelujah the vision could speak
[1:30:57] hallelujah
[1:30:59] hallelujah the vision could speak to him
[1:31:03] now I'm getting ahead of myself but do
[1:31:04] you realize how God anticipated for that
[1:31:08] but do you realize how God has
[1:31:10] anticipated 2,000 years ago through
[1:31:12] seven Church ages through the castle
[1:31:16] through the bridging through the
[1:31:18] breach that now God has a lady that he
[1:31:22] anticipated her coming she's got full
[1:31:24] Authority she's Bor him upon paone life
[1:31:27] of his life word of his word power of
[1:31:29] his
[1:31:30] power she matches my
[1:31:34] vision
[1:31:37] hallelujah what was
[1:31:42] it
[1:31:47] calvary
[1:31:50] Calvary produce the
[1:31:57] Masterpiece
[1:32:00] hallelujah
[1:32:02] hallelujah you don't have to do it on
[1:32:04] your
[1:32:06] own you don't have to fight your
[1:32:09] battles you don't have to be
[1:32:12] downtrodden he gave you
[1:32:14] purpose he gave you life he gave you
[1:32:17] hope he gave you peace I am your
[1:32:20] everything I am your all in all I Am The
[1:32:23] Offspring and the root of David I am
[1:32:26] Alpha I am
[1:32:32] Omega but when you go to reading John
[1:32:34] chapter
[1:32:36] 9 and you see this you see this as it's
[1:32:40] unfolding that the blind man has laid
[1:32:44] there all those
[1:32:45] years you imagine Jesus's closest friend
[1:32:49] they're walking with him and they pass
[1:32:51] by him on the way and I said now who
[1:32:55] sinned who
[1:32:57] sinned ain't it amazing that Humanity
[1:33:00] always goes to
[1:33:03] that they must have sin in their
[1:33:06] life said but who sinned this man or his
[1:33:11] parents but notice Jesus's
[1:33:15] words none of
[1:33:18] them but this was done for the glory of
[1:33:22] the
[1:33:23] Lord ain't amazing how Satan can make
[1:33:26] you feel guilty because of your children
[1:33:29] maybe they maybe they're just not where
[1:33:31] they need to be at
[1:33:34] yet Hallelujah I'm I'm a preach right
[1:33:37] here ain't it amazing how Satan can make
[1:33:40] you feel so guilty because maybe your
[1:33:43] children are not living up to par just
[1:33:45] yet or maybe maybe they haven't got
[1:33:47] their healing just yet oh it's on
[1:33:50] you
[1:33:52] it's on
[1:33:53] you but Jesus turns around and gives an
[1:33:56] answer to your question it ain't your
[1:33:59] fault it ain't your fault it ain't your
[1:34:02] fault they're blind it ain't your fault
[1:34:04] that they are where they are but this
[1:34:07] was done so that I could be
[1:34:19] glorified Shake That devil off of you
[1:34:23] Shake him off of you it ain't your fault
[1:34:26] it ain't your fault don't you worry
[1:34:28] about it God's about to do something
[1:34:31] bigger than you can
[1:34:37] imagine oh Jerry clar told a story one
[1:34:40] time okay to quote Jerry clar tonight I
[1:34:43] figure y'all all right with it y'all my
[1:34:44] people Jerry clar told about this farmer
[1:34:47] one time he told about this farmer that
[1:34:49] his his mule got knock down in there and
[1:34:51] knock down in a whale and fell down in
[1:34:52] that hole fell down in a hole and he
[1:34:56] looked for him all over his farm and
[1:34:57] couldn't find him and walked around and
[1:34:59] finally found him down there he was he
[1:35:00] hauling down there in that in that well
[1:35:02] and he thought
[1:35:04] well I guess I better bury him he a't no
[1:35:07] way I'm getting him out of
[1:35:09] there who thought Jerry clar could get
[1:35:11] mixed in mixed up in this he I guess I
[1:35:14] better bury him down there so he starts
[1:35:16] taking a shovel and starts burying him
[1:35:20] up but that old mule down there that old
[1:35:23] donkey every single time he throw he
[1:35:26] throw a little bit of dirt on him he
[1:35:27] just shake it
[1:35:30] off so the farmer said well it's going
[1:35:33] to take me all day to bury this guy
[1:35:35] every single time that dirt fall on top
[1:35:37] of him he just shake it off of him and
[1:35:39] before long he looked down in there and
[1:35:41] that mule that donkey he was shaking it
[1:35:44] off every single time he shake it off
[1:35:46] and he step up and the farmer started to
[1:35:48] realize real quick the more I throw that
[1:35:51] dirt in there the quicker he's going to
[1:35:53] get out of this hole so I'm saying this
[1:35:55] to you shake it off and step up Shake It
[1:36:00] Off Shake It Off Shake It Off Satan
[1:36:03] poured it on you shake it off the more
[1:36:07] it pours on you shake it
[1:36:10] off well blessed be the name of the
[1:36:13] Lord if a mes got that much knowledge
[1:36:17] how much more as Sons and Daughters of
[1:36:19] God should we have the power to take
[1:36:21] what Satan has tried to put on us as
[1:36:23] flaws and mistakes Shake It Off Of
[1:36:27] You Step Up step
[1:36:31] up you ain't as bad as you are as you
[1:36:34] think you
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:36:42] are I got to reading this today I'm
[1:36:46] about to have myself a conniption
[1:36:49] fit not Jerry clar
[1:36:56] when you go to reading John chapter
[1:36:58] n you you go studying the Greek out
[1:37:01] especially for a hillbilly like me you
[1:37:03] get to studying those things out it
[1:37:04] breaks down things in a whole another
[1:37:06] level than I can hardly read and when I
[1:37:08] see those things it makes me about tear
[1:37:11] tear a cabin apart make it look like
[1:37:14] toothpicks but when Jesus when Jesus was
[1:37:17] standing there in John chapter
[1:37:20] n
[1:37:22] mam said it in one place he said it like
[1:37:24] this that
[1:37:25] Jesus had preached so
[1:37:27] much that there was a puddle of
[1:37:30] spit sitting there to think that the
[1:37:34] author the spoken word was sitting there
[1:37:36] preaching he's preaching about this
[1:37:38] blind man preaching about this blind man
[1:37:41] he's got this condition in his life and
[1:37:43] he's and he's preaching about it and he
[1:37:44] spits on the ground and and when you go
[1:37:47] to studying that out that that he took
[1:37:49] the ground if you break it down in the
[1:37:52] Greek it means a fissure it means a flaw
[1:37:55] but Jesus Took a flaw and put it on the
[1:37:59] flaw and anointed his
[1:38:03] eyes he took a flaw and put it on a flaw
[1:38:07] and showed that a masterpiece was in the
[1:38:10] making he took a flaw and made it into
[1:38:14] Perfection what was he showing he was
[1:38:16] showing that elements that were not
[1:38:20] sufficient to be claimed as worthy that
[1:38:23] he can make them worthy so that it would
[1:38:25] produce
[1:38:27] perfection in your Humanity there are
[1:38:30] all types of
[1:38:38] flaws forgive
[1:38:40] me I saw you battling this last weekend
[1:38:44] sister Devin I know I know Satan battles
[1:38:48] you and it's real it's a real TR crap
[1:38:51] it's a real war for
[1:38:53] you but don't let it just be your your
[1:38:57] War because s because you're so fresh
[1:39:01] Satan makes you think that you're the
[1:39:02] only one here with flaws but I'd say
[1:39:04] that if all of us are real honest here
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:20] tonight
[1:39:25] but because you're maybe
[1:39:28] fresher Satan makes you feel like you
[1:39:30] got flaws makes you feel like you're the
[1:39:32] only one that that's battling the way
[1:39:33] that you are maybe that's your case
[1:39:35] maybe that's where you are but I'd say
[1:39:37] that every single one of
[1:39:39] us have flaws in our
[1:39:42] life that if we could look back in our
[1:39:47] Humanity but the thing of it is as a
[1:39:49] veteran you're you recognize that the
[1:39:51] blood is greater than your
[1:39:54] flaws but maybe if I can identify it to
[1:39:56] you like this because I've been where
[1:39:58] you've been and I saw you battling like
[1:40:00] you are and that's all
[1:40:02] right don't you ever let your past be
[1:40:05] bigger than your
[1:40:19] future but if if I could just put it in
[1:40:21] this
[1:40:22] way your
[1:40:24] flaws your
[1:40:27] mistakes if you didn't have
[1:40:30] it if you didn't have it if you didn't
[1:40:32] have it laying
[1:40:35] there the reason why you appreciate the
[1:40:38] sunshine is because the
[1:40:39] rain and because you appreciate the rain
[1:40:42] you appreciate the sunshine you
[1:40:44] understand the contrast of
[1:40:45] it and because of your
[1:40:49] flaws because of of your
[1:40:52] Humanity it keeps you always in
[1:40:59] hunger I just spend one on the devil for
[1:41:02] you he's been trying to bury you up with
[1:41:04] your
[1:41:05] flaw but your flaw is what keeps you
[1:41:09] close to the
[1:41:11] master without your flaw you wouldn't
[1:41:14] need the
[1:41:19] master but but when the flaw was seen
[1:41:24] then brother brandom said it was the
[1:41:27] Masterpiece what happened at Calvary
[1:41:30] when Christ was struck on the
[1:41:34] side he was perfect in every way he was
[1:41:38] born without sin he never lied he never
[1:41:41] told he never had a mistake in his life
[1:41:44] he was perfect he his his blood was
[1:41:46] perfect he was neither blood he was
[1:41:48] neither the blood of Jew nor Gentile he
[1:41:51] was perfection in
[1:41:55] himself but what makes him Jesus to me
[1:41:58] brother Jonathan is the
[1:42:01] flaw because when he was smot on his
[1:42:04] side you see what the enemy thought he
[1:42:07] was doing for evil when they smoted him
[1:42:10] on the side it brought me out it showed
[1:42:14] that I was
[1:42:17] redeemable
[1:42:19] Hallelujah
[1:42:22] God is not looking at your mistakes God
[1:42:25] is not looking at your
[1:42:28] imperfections he is looking at his
[1:42:31] promise to
[1:42:38] you Samson was a
[1:42:41] man he was a red blooded
[1:42:47] man fell in sin and so to
[1:42:51] David but God was not looking at
[1:42:55] Samson's
[1:42:58] sin what happened Samson had sin in his
[1:43:02] life but when the Philistines came in
[1:43:04] there what did he do he reached back
[1:43:06] there and touch the
[1:43:09] promise Hallelujah you see God is not
[1:43:12] concerned with your flaw and your
[1:43:15] Humanity he is concerned with his
[1:43:18] promise and I'm not giving you a license
[1:43:20] to sin but I'm telling you that your
[1:43:23] flaw shows that there was a Calvary that
[1:43:26] Jesus did not die in
[1:43:29] vain
[1:43:31] Hallelujah but I want you to know this
[1:43:33] this that Satan is
[1:43:36] always trying to find the
[1:43:38] flaw in
[1:43:41] humanity is this okay
[1:43:44] tonight he's always trying to find the
[1:43:46] flaw in humanity he's trying to look at
[1:43:49] some way to put a complex on an
[1:43:52] individual to mark his or her life and
[1:43:56] Mark it up in such a way that he that
[1:43:58] there there maybe they're that he could
[1:44:00] point out that they have a marred
[1:44:02] history you could look at Ruth you could
[1:44:05] look at Tamar you could look at
[1:44:08] Rahab but Satan is always trying to put
[1:44:11] a
[1:44:12] Mark or a flaw or find that
[1:44:16] flaw because if he can find that flaw he
[1:44:19] could turn around and say Well they're
[1:44:20] not worthy to be a believer or this
[1:44:23] brother is not able to preach because
[1:44:25] he's got an imperfection in his life or
[1:44:27] in in he's got a imperfection in his
[1:44:30] natural Humanity he can't he can't walk
[1:44:32] like other people he can't talk like
[1:44:34] other people that's the same way Moses
[1:44:36] was he had all kinds of
[1:44:38] imperfections but God was his absolute
[1:44:41] in it all but Satan is always trying to
[1:44:44] point out point out scriptures to make
[1:44:47] you feel and point out things in the
[1:44:50] scripture
[1:44:51] that he knows that you can't live up
[1:44:53] to so he points out scriptures in there
[1:44:56] to make you feel flawed by the
[1:45:00] word because he knows that Matthew 5:48
[1:45:03] tells us to be therefore perfect as your
[1:45:05] father in Heaven is
[1:45:07] perfect he knows you can't live up to
[1:45:11] that Satan knows you can't live up to
[1:45:15] that but I got good news for
[1:45:18] you you don't have to be be
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:24] perfect news flash you don't have to be
[1:45:28] perfect you can go through
[1:45:31] menopause and not be perfect you can go
[1:45:34] through trials of life and midlife
[1:45:36] crisises and not be perfect you can go
[1:45:39] through teenage years and not be perfect
[1:45:42] you don't have to be perfect because the
[1:45:44] Bible said in Hebrews 10:14 Heath
[1:45:47] therefore perfect perfected forever the
[1:45:50] them that are
[1:45:51] Sanctified so let me say this to you the
[1:45:54] only way that you can't be perfect is
[1:45:57] outside of the blood of Jesus
[1:46:02] Christ because if you really want to go
[1:46:04] Old Testament on this you wouldn't even
[1:46:06] allowed to come into the congregation
[1:46:08] four generations back if you had sin in
[1:46:10] your life but one time in the blood of
[1:46:13] Jesus Christ dipped in there makes you
[1:46:16] accessible to go into the presence of
[1:46:18] the Shana Glory
[1:46:24] brother Bon one time brother Bon one
[1:46:26] time he was you can go and listen to
[1:46:29] this you can go and listen to this in a
[1:46:31] masterpiece brother brandom goes in
[1:46:33] there and he there's a man there's a
[1:46:35] minister that come to him and he tells
[1:46:36] him he's said now
[1:46:38] look why are you constantly balling
[1:46:41] people
[1:46:42] out you're always balling the women out
[1:46:44] for their short hair and wearing shorts
[1:46:46] and all those things and don't you know
[1:46:48] that those people regard you as a
[1:46:49] prophet
[1:46:51] don't you know they regard you as a
[1:46:52] servant of the
[1:46:54] Lord Brother Bon said I said Lord give
[1:46:59] me an answer give me an answer so that I
[1:47:02] can answer this smart individual here
[1:47:05] and brother B said did you ever
[1:47:08] hear about the great producer of music
[1:47:11] Beethoven and he said well yeah he
[1:47:14] said he said you do realize that he gave
[1:47:18] one of the greatest masterpieces to the
[1:47:19] world through his inspiration he said
[1:47:21] but do you realize how many waste
[1:47:23] baskets full of scrap paper that he had
[1:47:26] tossed into a bin that's
[1:47:28] right and the man couldn't say one thing
[1:47:31] to him because he knew you see you might
[1:47:34] not agree with everything that your
[1:47:36] pastor's putting on you and it might cut
[1:47:38] and it might hurt but at the end of it
[1:47:41] it will produce a
[1:47:43] masterpiece you see because Beethoven
[1:47:46] had had an inspiration dropped in his
[1:47:48] heart and brother brandom said he prayed
[1:47:50] about it he prayed about it and he went
[1:47:52] into his room and he would begin to draw
[1:47:55] it all out and he would get get to a
[1:47:58] spot and it wouldn't match his
[1:47:59] inspiration and he would ball it up and
[1:48:02] he would throw it in the waist basket he
[1:48:04] would do it again and he would throw it
[1:48:06] in the waste
[1:48:07] basket Hallelujah you might get mad at
[1:48:10] me and you might get B mad at brother
[1:48:12] Ron but when the preaching of the word
[1:48:14] Goes Forth it might cut you it might
[1:48:17] hurt you but I want you to know at the
[1:48:19] end of it it's working all things for
[1:48:23] the good to them that love
[1:48:28] God and everybody may not be up to par
[1:48:32] like you are up to speed and your
[1:48:33] angelic wings but at the end of the
[1:48:36] result there'll be a
[1:48:40] masterpiece by the preaching of the
[1:48:44] word
[1:48:49] hallelujah
[1:48:54] hallelujah
[1:48:58] hallelujah you said brother
[1:49:01] Andrew but I just don't know how much I
[1:49:05] got left in
[1:49:08] me I don't know how much more I can
[1:49:16] press I don't know how much more I can
[1:49:19] persevere
[1:49:22] let's be honest here we
[1:49:25] all we all thought in our Humanity that
[1:49:28] God would have healed sister
[1:49:30] Erica in this
[1:49:34] life and you see those things you begin
[1:49:37] to
[1:49:38] think you begin to think about it and
[1:49:41] Satan begins to come in and Whisper was
[1:49:43] all you're
[1:49:45] praying was it in vain you spent all
[1:49:48] those hours praying it wasn't worth it
[1:49:50] are you kidding
[1:49:52] me are you kidding
[1:49:54] me how many times in prayer did we go to
[1:49:57] prayer for sister Erica and out of those
[1:49:59] prayer rooms came Sons and Daughters of
[1:50:01] God coming back to the house of the Lord
[1:50:03] how many times did you get into the
[1:50:05] presence of the Lord maybe praying for
[1:50:06] this one or praying for that one that
[1:50:08] God allowed you to tap into
[1:50:10] prayer and all of a sudden out of it
[1:50:13] begin to break Visions or Revelations
[1:50:15] and things that you haven't seen
[1:50:17] before and you might say I don't know
[1:50:20] how much more I can go I don't know how
[1:50:22] much more I got left in the tank I want
[1:50:24] you to say I want you to know that what
[1:50:26] you got left is more than
[1:50:28] enough if all you got just a little bit
[1:50:31] left I want you to know it's
[1:50:34] enough because when Elijah showed up at
[1:50:37] the Widow's house and all she had was a
[1:50:39] little bit of meal and a little bit of
[1:50:41] oil it was
[1:50:43] enough it was enough to get her out of a
[1:50:47] famine
[1:50:48] hallelujah what this said God takes what
[1:50:51] you got left and he brings it and makes
[1:50:53] it
[1:50:54] enough when you go to reading Exodus
[1:50:57] chapter 9 and you go to reading about
[1:50:58] all the Miracles that took place what
[1:51:01] happened in Exodus chapter 9 when you
[1:51:03] before you see the boils and the blaes
[1:51:05] begin to break out over all the men what
[1:51:08] happens God commands Aaron to take ashes
[1:51:12] off of the sacrifice what is a what is
[1:51:14] ashes it's what's left
[1:51:17] over it's what's left over and he come
[1:51:20] commands him take of the ashes sprinkle
[1:51:22] it in the air and because of the ashes
[1:51:25] there went out a cloud over all of Egypt
[1:51:28] it was more than enough what you got
[1:51:31] left is more than
[1:51:36] enough you may not feel it like that
[1:51:38] person feels it but I want you to know
[1:51:40] what I'm saying is Right On Target
[1:51:42] because they might feel like they're at
[1:51:44] the end of the rope and they feel like
[1:51:45] they're getting ready to give in but
[1:51:47] what you got
[1:51:48] left is enough to get you through you're
[1:51:52] not going to barely make it you're not
[1:51:54] going to give in you're not going to
[1:51:56] give
[1:51:58] up
[1:52:01] Hallelujah You Got What It Takes Elijah
[1:52:04] was everything the Widow had need of
[1:52:09] Hallelujah what came out of his side of
[1:52:14] Calvary may it look like what was
[1:52:17] left but it was enough
[1:52:21] look at Exodus CH 12 what he tell them
[1:52:24] take the blood take what's left put it
[1:52:27] over the door put it over the door what
[1:52:31] was it the blood was a sign that it had
[1:52:33] enough power to keep the death angel
[1:52:36] away and to get two million out of Egypt
[1:52:39] what am I saying to you that the token
[1:52:42] is everything that you have need of to
[1:52:44] get out of lay
[1:52:48] osia
[1:52:50] it's high time that you recognize that
[1:52:52] the
[1:52:53] token is
[1:52:55] everything that's right brother baram
[1:52:58] said he said it in this way he said the
[1:53:02] message is the
[1:53:08] token the message is the
[1:53:12] token what is it what is the message
[1:53:15] brother Ang why do y'all always going to
[1:53:16] church it's
[1:53:18] Christ

[1:53:24] us what is the message been in the
[1:53:27] message 30 years what really is the
[1:53:31] message I thought dear God have you said
[1:53:34] here that long not
[1:53:37] here not here but from a different place
[1:53:40] have you sat here so long that you don't
[1:53:41] realize the message what's Church to you
[1:53:44] brother Chris what's Church to you
[1:53:46] sister Brenda what's church it's Christ
[1:53:50] yeah there's some people that don't need
[1:53:52] as much church as you
[1:53:57] need because they can't show
[1:54:07] up we real clear here
[1:54:11] tonight what have they got brother
[1:54:13] Andrew brother Brandon would say like
[1:54:15] this they got teacup religion they get
[1:54:17] so full they only want a 15 minute and
[1:54:20] they don't want to preacher to preach to
[1:54:21] him very loud and they want don't want
[1:54:22] him to say a man and they don't want him
[1:54:24] to scream or
[1:54:27] holler he said but I'm tired of seeing
[1:54:30] sermonettes by preacher
[1:54:33] ATS well I don't know about y'all Full
[1:54:36] Gospel Lighthouse but ain't too many
[1:54:37] teacups sitting around here and I don't
[1:54:40] believe that God's looking for teacup
[1:54:44] religion I don't know how we got there
[1:54:46] but we got
[1:54:48] there
[1:54:50] but what is
[1:54:51] church what's church about what's a
[1:54:54] sermon really what's a song about come
[1:54:58] on what's praise about what's singing
[1:55:01] about what dancing
[1:55:03] about come on somebody it's about Christ
[1:55:08] your flaws are perfected in
[1:55:12] Christ Hallelujah I got all these flaws
[1:55:15] in my life brother Andel let me tell you
[1:55:17] the higher you praise the more you
[1:55:19] forget about your flaws the higher you
[1:55:22] pray the higher you sing the higher you
[1:55:25] dance the more you forget about your
[1:55:29] flaws so what church it's about getting
[1:55:33] the flaws out of your
[1:55:43] life really what what are we what are we
[1:55:45] holding on
[1:55:46] to I done pre I done preach this it's a
[1:55:48] very it's a
[1:55:50] I don't know if you feel it in the room
[1:55:51] or not but this is a dynamic
[1:55:56] service but was Jesus standing there in
[1:55:59] the
[1:56:00] house and he called them and he tells
[1:56:02] him you've made my house a
[1:56:05] denes what was he telling them that he
[1:56:07] was a reason for
[1:56:10] church he was a reason for it and there
[1:56:13] they were looking at the message they
[1:56:16] were looking at the message but they
[1:56:18] couldn't see him because they was still
[1:56:20] behind the veiled of him and the rest of
[1:56:23] the world don't understand like you
[1:56:26] understand but because you have stepped
[1:56:29] behind the
[1:56:31] veil that God has come on the inside of
[1:56:34] your Badger
[1:56:39] skins he looked at mo mo Michaelangelo
[1:56:42] looked at his Moses and he said speak
[1:56:45] and they couldn't speak back to him but
[1:56:48] God looked at Jesus and it could speak
[1:56:51] and what did it say father forgive them
[1:56:54] for they know not what they
[1:56:57] do but notice Michelangelo when he
[1:57:00] smoted him he could not put back what he
[1:57:04] had already done but your Prophet said
[1:57:07] that God is going to reproduce Jesus
[1:57:10] Christ in this
[1:57:11] day he's putting the flaw back in its
[1:57:14] original
[1:57:17] place and he's looking at you
[1:57:19] you're matching his match piece you're
[1:57:22] matching his vision and he says
[1:57:26] speak why did he look at Moses out there
[1:57:28] at the Red Sea said why are you crying
[1:57:30] unto me speak and go forward little
[1:57:32] bride you are a part of the vision you
[1:57:36] are matching what God thought
[1:57:43] of
[1:57:45] Hallelujah I can't imagine what heaven's
[1:57:47] going to be like
[1:57:50] God's got it completely drawn
[1:57:54] out here you war with your
[1:57:58] flesh but we are not after the
[1:58:02] flesh we are after the
[1:58:09] spirit brother Brandon would say it like
[1:58:13] this he said he perfected
[1:58:16] everything and he's got a rig jury
[1:58:21] he's both
[1:58:22] judge
[1:58:26] jury judge jury and the attorney and
[1:58:30] he's looking over your life and what is
[1:58:32] he looking at you and he's saying not
