[55:34] name amen amen if you have your Bibles
[55:37] this evening we'd like to look over
[55:39] two places in the Old Testament
[55:42] just in Leviticus chapter 25 and verse 8
[55:45] then down to Genesis chapter 18.
[55:53] Leviticus chapter 25.
[55:56] and verse 8 and
[55:58] the Lord has placed something upon our
[56:01] heart to
[56:02] to deal with here in the next next
[56:05] little bit and and we know that we're in
[56:08] a very special season that has Full
[56:10] Gospel Lighthouse this is our this is
[56:12] our 50th year as a church body here in
[56:16] the Elkton area we we started 50 years
[56:19] ago in 1973 and brother Bill Hinkles in
[56:22] his basement of his home there and and
[56:25] there from that there the lord gave a
[56:27] vision that our church would be started
[56:29] up here and on off of right right off of
[56:32] Route 33 and brother Homer had seen a
[56:35] vision of the the the things hanging out
[56:38] of the ceiling there and the Lord
[56:39] blessed and the Lord sent sent people
[56:42] that would receive a message and the
[56:44] church grew and from there we we moved
[56:46] up as a church to Summit Avenue and we
[56:49] turned a house and into a real church
[56:51] and we had Supernatural times there and
[56:53] and the Lord blessed and he he seemed
[56:55] fit to give us this building that we're
[56:57] in here since 1991 and the Lord has
[57:00] certainly blessed us here at Full Gospel
[57:02] White House and I know that I know that
[57:05] I have my sister that's going to be
[57:06] working on that maybe a slideshow if we
[57:08] can make some of those things available
[57:09] for us in the next in the next little
[57:12] bit but we just want to our minds are
[57:14] here our hearts are here but I would
[57:16] like to speak to you for a little bit on
[57:19] our Jubilee our Jubilee this is our 50th
[57:22] year and I believe that we are entering
[57:25] into some of the most special times as
[57:26] the Bride of Jesus Christ that we've
[57:28] ever entered into and and I just
[57:31] countered a privilege you know to be
[57:33] standing a church 50 years standing
[57:35] without denominational ties standing
[57:37] without but we're standing fully upon
[57:40] the message of the hour and the Lord has
[57:42] been our provider we didn't ask for we
[57:45] didn't ask for people just to fill the
[57:46] pews we ask for Sons and Daughters of
[57:48] God that would truly Worship the Lord
[57:50] and God has filled this building and we
[57:53] don't know whether time will Terry
[57:54] another 20 years or another five years
[57:56] we're going to need another building
[57:57] because people are hungry for the very
[57:59] word of God and I just say it to God God
[58:03] be the glory in all of these things and
[58:05] so we we can never say enough about our
[58:07] founder brother Homer Frazier and the
[58:10] vision to have this church here upon
[58:11] this hill we were they the engineers
[58:14] told us that we'd never be able to have
[58:15] a church up here but we had a vision and
[58:18] because a man had a vision the church is
[58:20] here upon this upon this Hillside and
[58:22] we're just thankful to be a lighthouse
[58:24] for these 50 years and I believe that if
[58:27] the Lord tarries will continue to be a
[58:29] lighthouse amen Leviticus chapter 25 and
[58:33] verse 8.
[58:34] and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of
[58:37] the Year unto thee seven times seven
[58:41] years and the space of the seven
[58:43] sabbaths of years shall be unto thee
[58:46] forty and nine years and then shalt thou
[58:49] cause the trumpet of Jubilee to sound on
[58:52] the tenth day of the seventh month in
[58:54] the day of atonement shall ye make the
[58:57] trumpet sound throughout all
[58:59] your land and you shall hallow the 50th
[59:03] year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all
[59:05] the land and unto the inhabitants
[59:07] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you
[59:09] and ye shall return every man unto his
[59:12] possession and you shall return every
[59:14] man unto his family also in Genesis
[59:18] Chapter 18 and verse 9.
[59:24] you love the Lord this evening
[59:26] amen Genesis chapter 18.
[59:31] Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 9.
[59:40] and they said unto him where is Sarah
[59:43] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[59:46] and said I will certainly return unto
[59:49] thee in according to the time of life
[59:52] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[59:54] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[59:56] which was behind him now Abraham and
[59:59] Sarah were old and well stricken in age
[1:00:01] and it ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:00:04] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:00:06] within herself saying after I am waxed
[1:00:09] old shall I have pleasure with my Lord
[1:00:12] at being old also and the Lord said unto
[1:00:14] Abram
[1:00:15] Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying
[1:00:18] I shall I of assurity bear a child which
[1:00:21] IM old is anything too hard for the Lord
[1:00:25] at the time appointed I will return
[1:00:28] return unto thee according to the time
[1:00:31] of life and Sarah shall have a son may
[1:00:35] God bless his word he may be seated in
[1:00:37] the presence of the Lord and from these
[1:00:39] texts tonight I would like to draw a
[1:00:41] thought on our our Jubilee our Jubilee
[1:00:46] and I think it's a very powerful thing
[1:00:47] that when you begin to study the
[1:00:49] scriptures I think it's very wonderful
[1:00:51] thing that you can recognize that Elohim
[1:00:54] is saying that I will return and to
[1:00:56] think that that this is right here
[1:00:58] before the change of Abraham and Sarah's
[1:01:00] body but they had lived such a life as
[1:01:03] such a close life to our Lord Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ and begin to Fellowship that they
[1:01:08] could have fellowship with Melchizedek
[1:01:10] they could sit down and they could enjoy
[1:01:12] his Fellowship they could feed him of
[1:01:15] the uh they could feed him of the calf
[1:01:17] of the land they could sit down and have
[1:01:18] Fellowship but because of the
[1:01:20] interaction that Abraham had had
[1:01:23] throughout all of his life with Abraham
[1:01:25] with God and Abraham having it with God
[1:01:27] and God having it with Abraham that he
[1:01:29] lived a life that was completely
[1:01:31] separated it caused a spot where Abraham
[1:01:34] could have fellowship with Melchizedek
[1:01:36] and Melchizedek could say that I am
[1:01:38] going to return unto you at the church
[1:01:41] certain time of life and to think that
[1:01:43] the god of the universe is saying unto
[1:01:45] Abraham that I'm going to return unto
[1:01:48] you and I'm going to bring Liberty to
[1:01:50] your body to the things which you
[1:01:52] couldn't do in the natural I'm going to
[1:01:54] make possible by the supernatural you
[1:01:56] see when Melchizedek shows up he's going
[1:01:59] to take the former things and he's going
[1:02:01] to make them new you see there's nothing
[1:02:03] that is too hard for our Lord when when
[1:02:06] our Lord Jesus Christ begins to show up
[1:02:08] in our lives and we watch the very
[1:02:10] physical things in our life as they
[1:02:12] begin to roll off of us because of the
[1:02:14] power of a new birth and the change of a
[1:02:17] nature and we recognize that that he
[1:02:19] will be the one that will stand there as
[1:02:21] we read in Revelations chapter 21 that
[1:02:24] he will wipe all the tears is out of off
[1:02:26] of our eyes and the former things are
[1:02:28] going to be passed away and he that set
[1:02:31] upon the throne says behold I make all
[1:02:34] things new so the one that came and
[1:02:36] touched Abraham and Sarah's life is the
[1:02:39] same exact one that has touched your
[1:02:41] life and made you new a new creature in
[1:02:44] Christ Jesus and I think it's a very
[1:02:46] wonderful thing to recognize that we are
[1:02:48] in a ear of Jubilee and it's not just
[1:02:51] necessarily for Full Gospel Lighthouse
[1:02:53] but it's for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:02:55] that we are in a time where we can
[1:02:58] Proclaim Liberty amongst the Church of
[1:03:01] the Living God and we recognize that
[1:03:03] that that in the time of return or in
[1:03:06] the Feast of Jubilee that there would
[1:03:08] come a time when every seven years every
[1:03:10] seven years there was a Sabbath and
[1:03:12] every seven days was a Sabbath but every
[1:03:15] seven years and stack it up together
[1:03:17] seven years at what added up to put it
[1:03:21] together it's 49 years but on the 50th
[1:03:24] year it was a a time of Jubilee and
[1:03:27] Jubilee was a time when every man that
[1:03:30] had lost his inheritance whether it be
[1:03:32] by the means of poverty or whether it be
[1:03:34] by the means of different ways of losing
[1:03:37] it through a sale or different things if
[1:03:39] that man was Freeborn if he was a
[1:03:41] Freeborn Israelite and he was Blood
[1:03:43] Bought blood bought by an Israelite that
[1:03:46] he could go back to his possession it
[1:03:49] didn't matter who had that possession
[1:03:50] whether it was a king that had that
[1:03:52] possession or whether it was just that
[1:03:54] just another spot or a squatter or
[1:03:57] another person on the land if he was an
[1:03:59] Israelite he could go back to that
[1:04:02] possession that he had owned he didn't
[1:04:04] have to pay a thing for it he didn't
[1:04:06] have to do a thing for it but he just
[1:04:08] stopped what he was doing lay down his
[1:04:10] old Treasures lay down all of his old
[1:04:12] old things lay down all of his own
[1:04:14] habitants and he would go back to his
[1:04:17] inheritance you see what it meant it was
[1:04:19] Grace unto him provided unto him that he
[1:04:22] could go back and return to his rightful
[1:04:24] inheritance it's and I I think it's a
[1:04:26] wonderful thing tonight that we
[1:04:28] recognize that it's not just a feast for
[1:04:30] Israel but it's a feast for every single
[1:04:33] one of us to recognize that when they
[1:04:36] were standing there and the priest would
[1:04:38] blow the trumpet it would send out a
[1:04:40] sound throughout all of Israel that it
[1:04:43] was a time of Jubilee and they were very
[1:04:46] certain about it they knew where they
[1:04:48] were if you were a slave master and you
[1:04:50] recognize that you had slave men
[1:04:52] underneath enslaved women underneath of
[1:04:55] durabilities that those people could go
[1:04:57] absolutely free on the day of Jubilee
[1:05:00] and there was nothing that the slave
[1:05:02] master slave master could do you see
[1:05:05] where that trumpet denoted he was
[1:05:07] assembled to every slave that no matter
[1:05:09] how long he'd been a slave whether it
[1:05:11] was one year or 49 years he could go
[1:05:14] back to his possession that had passed
[1:05:16] down to him through his mother and his
[1:05:18] father and throughout the generations of
[1:05:20] traditions that he could go back to that
[1:05:22] inheritance that was rightfully his he
[1:05:25] didn't have to work for it
[1:05:27] he didn't have to pull forward he didn't
[1:05:29] have to beg for it but everything was
[1:05:32] rightfully given back to him in the Year
[1:05:34] of Jubilee when he heard the sound of
[1:05:37] the trumpet now you know good and well
[1:05:39] that that that those men that heard that
[1:05:42] trumpet they could go free but a man
[1:05:44] that stood back there and didn't walk
[1:05:46] out and go back to his inheritance
[1:05:48] walked out in front of the priest and
[1:05:50] they bore a hole in his ear and it was a
[1:05:53] sign that he would have to stay a slave
[1:05:55] for the rest of his years but the time
[1:05:57] when the Jubilee was sounding out he was
[1:06:00] a sign that this is your chance
[1:06:03] this is your opportunity that the sound
[1:06:05] is coming forth that the spirit of the
[1:06:08] Lord is here to Proclaim Liberty upon
[1:06:11] the captives and it's a time and it's
[1:06:13] some season that we're in or a time in
[1:06:15] the moment that this is the Year of
[1:06:18] Jubilee so let me say it like this no
[1:06:21] matter how far you are in sin no matter
[1:06:23] how dark of a condition that you're in
[1:06:25] no matter how bad a hole hole that you
[1:06:27] are in you could drop what you were
[1:06:29] doing
[1:06:31] and you could walk out to your Liberties
[1:06:33] that were rightfully given you by the
[1:06:35] Son of God and it didn't matter what had
[1:06:37] or what sickness that was upon you it
[1:06:40] didn't matter what sin that was upon you
[1:06:42] you could go rightfully back to the
[1:06:44] things that were rightfully yours
[1:06:46] because you had heard a voice that you
[1:06:48] could go free I'll tell you Church of
[1:06:50] the Living God we've went through the
[1:06:52] birth pains and we recognize that this
[1:06:55] day this scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:06:58] ears so I want to say to you Church Be
[1:07:00] steady God is fixing to move
[1:07:04] it doesn't matter where you are it
[1:07:06] doesn't matter how long you've been a
[1:07:07] Christian it doesn't matter what you've
[1:07:09] gone through doesn't matter where you
[1:07:11] are when you hear the sound of the
[1:07:14] trumpet of Jubilee you don't have to be
[1:07:16] uncertain about it because it's a
[1:07:18] certain sound
[1:07:19] I'll tell you what it was the voice had
[1:07:21] said to you that you don't have to work
[1:07:23] for that slave master no more you don't
[1:07:26] have to live under that complex no more
[1:07:28] you don't have to live under your false
[1:07:30] decisions and your own moves no more
[1:07:33] I'll tell you what it was the slave
[1:07:35] masters Authority had been broken by the
[1:07:37] sound of that trumpet so there was no
[1:07:40] more power behind that Taskmaster when
[1:07:43] they immediately when the Jubilee
[1:07:45] trumpet had sounded it became the
[1:07:47] authority of all the land that the power
[1:07:50] of saying of Satan's kingdom had been
[1:07:53] broken
[1:07:55] foreign
[1:07:57] I hope you hear me talking to you loud
[1:07:59] and clear tonight
[1:08:00] this is our Jubilee you don't have to
[1:08:02] wait for another Moment The Vision has
[1:08:05] spoken the vision has given us the
[1:08:07] authority to recognize that the message
[1:08:10] is right
[1:08:11] the messages are Authority
[1:08:14] the message is a call to come back you
[1:08:17] see that's exactly what the message of
[1:08:18] the hour is it's to return back to the
[1:08:22] very word of God
[1:08:24] you see William Brandon would say in the
[1:08:26] message of it is the rising of the sun
[1:08:28] he said how can the Bride come and fail
[1:08:31] to manifest everything that was promised
[1:08:33] of him and the groom come and he
[1:08:35] wouldn't be the right he said but when
[1:08:37] he did everything even The Proven by
[1:08:39] raising himself up from the dead
[1:08:41] afterwards then don't the bride have to
[1:08:43] do the same thing
[1:08:45] have to be exactly what the word said
[1:08:47] she would be in the last days don't you
[1:08:50] don't you see that she has to return
[1:08:53] through Malachi 4. you see that's the
[1:08:56] only way that you can return back to
[1:08:58] what God intended you for was to return
[1:09:01] through the ministry of Malachi 4. you
[1:09:04] see that's exactly what the message has
[1:09:06] done it's turn our hearts back to an
[1:09:08] altar back to a praise without shackles
[1:09:11] upon our life without sin Upon Our Life
[1:09:13] to recognize who we are and what God
[1:09:16] called and destined us to be and I'll
[1:09:18] say this as it wasn't just for William
[1:09:21] Brandon the message wasn't just for
[1:09:22] William Branham the message just wasn't
[1:09:24] for the Branham family it wasn't just
[1:09:26] for the elite of so-called preachers but
[1:09:29] it's for whosoever will that God elected
[1:09:32] before the foundation of the world this
[1:09:34] message is your authority to tell Satan
[1:09:37] to take his dirty hands off of God's
[1:09:40] Property that's what this message has
[1:09:42] done it's ripped every lie and told the
[1:09:45] Devil he's false and it's told you that
[1:09:48] these are the true sayings of God
[1:09:53] let me tell you what good is it going to
[1:09:55] do if David was the only one that had
[1:09:57] the ability to kill Giants
[1:09:59] David would have been a worn out human
[1:10:01] being if he was the only one that could
[1:10:04] stand out there and sway Giants but I'll
[1:10:06] tell you what it was they'd set out
[1:10:08] there under the ministry of Saul and
[1:10:11] they got scared and they were a bunch of
[1:10:12] cowards for 40 days
[1:10:15] and they watched a little anointed boy
[1:10:17] come down off of a hill and when all of
[1:10:19] Israel had been scared and been a coward
[1:10:22] for 40 days when they watched David show
[1:10:24] up they recognize that their anointing
[1:10:27] was back
[1:10:29] they recognize that they're anointing
[1:10:32] had returned back to the camp of Israel
[1:10:34] and they watched what David did and it
[1:10:37] was a sign of him that they could do the
[1:10:39] same thing
[1:10:40] what good is it going to do to stand
[1:10:43] there and just say it was just for
[1:10:45] William branov but the same anointing
[1:10:47] under this message has given us a bride
[1:10:51] with authority to stand toe-to-toe with
[1:10:53] the devil called Maniacs what they are
[1:10:55] but call Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:10:59] what good you're going to do brother
[1:11:01] Chris if William Branham is the only one
[1:11:03] that can lay hands upon the sick and
[1:11:06] only they recover then we're preaching a
[1:11:08] false identity of a word but if it's for
[1:11:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ it's it for
[1:11:14] whosoever will these little girls can
[1:11:16] lay their hands on you those Brothers in
[1:11:18] the back can lay their hands upon you
[1:11:20] and you watch the sick be healed
[1:11:23] what are you saying brother Andrew this
[1:11:26] is our Liberty and it's not just for Joy
[1:11:29] Bales it's not just for dancing it's not
[1:11:32] just for emotion our Liberty is back to
[1:11:35] the fullness of the word to confess that
[1:11:38] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:11:40] and forever
[1:11:43] I'm as good as well known that I'm an
[1:11:45] emotional human being what what good is
[1:11:48] it going to do if the message just puts
[1:11:50] us up on a bubble and it makes us shout
[1:11:52] makes us get excited but if this message
[1:11:55] has been a return back to the faith
[1:12:03] I'm telling you that every Liberty that
[1:12:05] is laying here in the word of God you
[1:12:07] are free to it
[1:12:11] come on somebody John 14 12 is for you
[1:12:14] John 15 7 is for you Hebrews 13 8 is for
[1:12:19] you
[1:12:22] I know there's a whole lot of giants in
[1:12:24] the land
[1:12:25] but William Branham ain't the only one
[1:12:27] that can kill him
[1:12:30] come on somebody I see some Charles
[1:12:32] Grimms out there I see some Lawrence
[1:12:35] signs out there that say Hey this is my
[1:12:38] mountain and we're more than able to
[1:12:40] take it
[1:12:42] come on somebody I see some Doug Bowman
[1:12:45] said some Jerry breeding and some Scotty
[1:12:48] Huffman's this is our anointing this is
[1:12:51] our Authority this is our message this
[1:12:53] is our calling
[1:12:58] you see there always was people that
[1:13:01] were skeptic that there was that there
[1:13:04] was Giants in the land and always been
[1:13:06] brought up for question where where was
[1:13:08] them Giants where was them signs at
[1:13:10] where what if there was jobs I think the
[1:13:13] Bible's just telling us something you
[1:13:15] see there's a whole lot of people that
[1:13:16] are sitting around the message today I
[1:13:18] said well where where is the sign of of
[1:13:21] his approval where's the sign of casting
[1:13:23] out Devils I'll tell you where it's at
[1:13:25] it's in the bride's body but it was
[1:13:27] always up for question whether there was
[1:13:29] real giants or not but there was a
[1:13:32] farmer in 1963 over in Israel and he was
[1:13:36] plowing up his he was plowing up his
[1:13:38] field and when he got to digging up his
[1:13:40] field he stuck his plow down in there
[1:13:42] and when he went in there he broke open
[1:13:44] a treasure Grove a Philistine weapons
[1:13:47] they knew it was Philistines weapons by
[1:13:50] the markings and how big it was
[1:13:53] these things were huge go on the end of
[1:13:55] a spear that were they were some I
[1:13:57] forget the exact but I believe are 40
[1:13:59] pounds 40 pounds for a Spearhead
[1:14:02] but they recognize that this was the
[1:14:05] identity that Giants was in that land
[1:14:07] and I think it's amazing that it was in
[1:14:10] 1963 that they found out that there was
[1:14:13] proof that Giants were back there it was
[1:14:16] in this hour in 1963 that their Satan
[1:14:19] was exposed as who he was that he didn't
[1:14:22] have the authority to hold the bride's
[1:14:25] body no longer because she has heard her
[1:14:28] sound of freedom
[1:14:30] what was it when the seals were released
[1:14:33] those those demons were released out of
[1:14:36] the river of Euphrates two hundred
[1:14:37] thousand thousand demons
[1:14:41] but there is a weapon that is greater
[1:14:44] than anywhere Earthly foe or any demonic
[1:14:47] power the message has called us back to
[1:14:51] Sons and Daughters of God to our
[1:14:53] rightful position which Adam had sold us
[1:14:55] into slavery through the fall at the
[1:14:58] beginning there
[1:15:00] but before Adam could fall and get all
[1:15:03] of humanity in a fallen condition you
[1:15:06] and I were in the back part of God's
[1:15:08] mind before an Adam was spoken broke
[1:15:11] into existence before a molecule was
[1:15:14] rolled over you was in the back part of
[1:15:17] God's mind that God was going to let
[1:15:19] himself be expressed through his
[1:15:21] attributes that had a representation by
[1:15:25] predestination you see God knows you
[1:15:27] look at your neighbor say God knew me
[1:15:31] he knew you just like he knew the woman
[1:15:34] at the well before he ever went and sat
[1:15:37] down there he knew he was going by
[1:15:39] Samaria because the Bible said that he
[1:15:42] had need to go by there
[1:15:43] and when he went up there and was
[1:15:45] sitting on that well and was having a
[1:15:47] conversation with this woman he began to
[1:15:50] talk to her but before he ever got there
[1:15:52] William Branham said that there was a
[1:15:55] scripture that was laying down on the
[1:15:58] inside of that little girl's heart
[1:16:01] that this is exactly what the Messiah
[1:16:03] would be what was she looking at it was
[1:16:06] a purifier manifested in the bride or in
[1:16:09] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:12] you see what she was looking at was
[1:16:15] exactly what she needed
[1:16:19] I'll tell you what William Branham said
[1:16:21] he said while Jesus was setting on that
[1:16:23] well he began to discern her hearts that
[1:16:26] would give her her Liberty
[1:16:29] what was it it was Hebrews 14 and 12 the
[1:16:33] word that is a sharp to which its sword
[1:16:36] what was it he went into her past
[1:16:40] he told her what was holding her back he
[1:16:43] told her what was keeping her from her
[1:16:45] from her liberties
[1:16:46] but he went all the way in her future
[1:16:49] and when she saw her future was clear in
[1:16:52] Christ Jesus she dropped her source of
[1:16:54] life and she ran into the City and said
[1:16:58] come and see a man what was it he was
[1:17:01] the return of the pillar fire that had
[1:17:04] led Moses was now in the body called
[1:17:07] Jesus Christ I say this that you are now
[1:17:11] under the return of the pillar of Fire
[1:17:17] 2000 years we look for it but now it's
[1:17:20] come and encapsulated the bride's body
[1:17:23] of Jesus Christ
[1:17:26] William Branham says a very powerful
[1:17:29] thing in the seven churches he said this
[1:17:31] age started just after the turn of the
[1:17:34] 20th century he said as it was to the
[1:17:36] age to be the age in which in which the
[1:17:40] Church the true church would return to
[1:17:43] being the bride that she was at
[1:17:45] Pentecost he said we know that there
[1:17:48] must be a necessity of a return of the
[1:17:51] dynamic power you see you see it's in
[1:17:54] this hour it's in this moment that the
[1:17:57] bride is returning back to the bride
[1:17:59] that she was all the way back there two
[1:18:02] thousand years ago in the upper room on
[1:18:04] the day of Pentecost
[1:18:06] and this message has called this bride
[1:18:09] to turn back to the faith to restore to
[1:18:13] return and just as the prodigal son who
[1:18:17] had made his return back to the father's
[1:18:19] house you you have made your return
[1:18:21] you always was a son even when you ask
[1:18:25] for your possessions even when you went
[1:18:27] out there and you spin it on every
[1:18:29] worldly thing you always was a son
[1:18:32] though he drifted from the truth though
[1:18:34] he drifted from his inheritance down on
[1:18:37] the inside of him he knew that he was a
[1:18:40] son
[1:18:41] when he was in a pog's pen he knew he
[1:18:44] was a son when he was barely making it
[1:18:46] he knew he was a son but he had a mama
[1:18:49] and daddy that knew he was a son
[1:18:52] when he was in his worst condition he
[1:18:55] had a mom and daddy that knew he was a
[1:18:57] son that knew he was a rightful heir of
[1:19:00] the Kingdom that they had
[1:19:02] and an angel came and tapped him on the
[1:19:04] shoulder and said it's time to go back
[1:19:06] home
[1:19:07] I remember when the angel came and
[1:19:09] touched me I was hit it my way but the
[1:19:12] angel turned me back
[1:19:17] Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's exactly
[1:19:21] what Christ is coming for for those that
[1:19:23] have made a return back
[1:19:28] you're enjoying his appearing but get
[1:19:30] ready he's coming
[1:19:33] you enjoy his appearing all week long
[1:19:35] but he's coming for you because you made
[1:19:38] a return Hallelujah because you wouldn't
[1:19:41] let any Earthly pressures or any Earthly
[1:19:44] foes keep you from returning back
[1:19:48] the Holy Ghost is mine
[1:19:51] the Holy Ghost is my possession this
[1:19:54] message is everything I got he is my
[1:19:56] possession this Pentecostal experience
[1:19:58] is our possession it is our inheritance
[1:20:04] what are you looking at you're looking
[1:20:07] at hearts that have turned back to the
[1:20:10] Pentecostal Dynamics
[1:20:14] let me tell you if all this message is
[1:20:15] it's just mechanics and it can't produce
[1:20:18] a very Dynamic power of Jesus Christ
[1:20:20] then we ought to put all the books on
[1:20:22] his health and leave him a prayer but if
[1:20:25] we can get our young girls and preach to
[1:20:27] them the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:20:30] the message restored everything that had
[1:20:32] been robbed off of it
[1:20:34] and watch them get filled with the Holy
[1:20:36] Ghost then I believe we ought to preach
[1:20:38] it until every breath is out of our
[1:20:41] lungs
[1:20:43] the message has turned us back
[1:20:46] [Applause]
[1:20:49] see what this message is is exactly the
[1:20:52] Gospel of Jesus Christ and Paul said in
[1:20:55] First Corinthians 14 and 8 that if a
[1:20:57] trumpet give an uncertain sound who can
[1:21:00] prepare himself for battle in other
[1:21:03] words who will recognize the signal to
[1:21:05] show up
[1:21:08] so if the message is sounding out
[1:21:10] something different than what the author
[1:21:12] wrote you're not going to know when to
[1:21:13] show up
[1:21:15] but because you're here
[1:21:19] it shows that the message has a certain
[1:21:21] sound to it
[1:21:23] now I know a lot of people can't
[1:21:25] understand what it's saying but to you
[1:21:27] that know you showed up to battle
[1:21:29] you showed up when God called you
[1:21:32] sister handle you was on a run for a
[1:21:34] long time but the sound of the Gospel
[1:21:37] trumpet came by your way
[1:21:41] and you knew to show up
[1:21:45] Hallelujah you see when the trumpet when
[1:21:48] you see the trumpet of God sounding the
[1:21:50] word of God and God vindicating it with
[1:21:52] signs and wonders as he said it would be
[1:21:54] he said if the trumpet gives an
[1:21:56] uncertain sound he said the chief
[1:21:58] Captain won't vindicate the call
[1:22:01] he said my brother he said that was a
[1:22:03] stomach fool he said the chief Captain
[1:22:05] won't vindicate the call for he said in
[1:22:07] Mark 16 all the world these signs shall
[1:22:10] follow them that believe that's the
[1:22:12] chief Captain he said in my name
[1:22:15] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[1:22:18] speak with tongues Hallelujah he said
[1:22:20] that's the call the captain said I'll
[1:22:22] vindicate them by this he that believeth
[1:22:25] on me not on him not him that says he
[1:22:28] believes but he that believes on me the
[1:22:31] works that I do shall he do also
[1:22:36] so if we say we have the spirit of
[1:22:38] Christ and we don't do the works of
[1:22:39] Christ then something's wrong
[1:22:43] you all know good and well by now I'm
[1:22:45] not a carpenter
[1:22:48] only thing I can build is sermons
[1:22:51] sometimes I wonder about that but you
[1:22:54] don't want me using a hammer brother
[1:22:55] Terry took it out of my Granddaddy's
[1:22:57] hand because he wasn't a carpenter
[1:23:00] a lot of people trying to take a hammer
[1:23:02] out of my hand the only thing I'm good
[1:23:03] for is destroying things
[1:23:07] that's pretty much true
[1:23:14] yes sir
[1:23:17] but if I told you that I had the spirit
[1:23:19] of a great Carpenter on me and I went
[1:23:21] out here and all I could build you was a
[1:23:23] chicken shed that would fall over in a
[1:23:25] few days you would say that the spirit
[1:23:27] that is upon me is not the spirit of a
[1:23:29] contractor is that right if I told you I
[1:23:31] had the spirit of a mechanic uphold me
[1:23:33] and all I could do was tear down your
[1:23:35] motor but I couldn't put it back to say
[1:23:37] the spirit that I have upon me is a part
[1:23:39] of a demolition to Herbie man and I'm
[1:23:42] not the man that can put it back
[1:23:43] together but if I can say to you that I
[1:23:46] had the spirit of Christ upon me and I
[1:23:48] can't do the works of Christ then
[1:23:50] something's wrong with my confession but
[1:23:52] if I have his spirit
[1:23:55] I can lay my hands upon those that are
[1:23:58] demon possessed and I say Satan take
[1:24:00] your dirty rotten hands or for God's
[1:24:03] Property it's by his spirit it's by his
[1:24:06] might
[1:24:09] what is it it's the return of our Lord
[1:24:12] Jesus Christ in his bride's body
[1:24:18] and William Branham said the call will
[1:24:19] come right through this
[1:24:22] it'll come right through this little
[1:24:24] body
[1:24:26] see what it is it's the token life of
[1:24:28] Jesus Christ it's the literal return of
[1:24:32] Jesus Christ return back upon the
[1:24:36] believer
[1:24:37] is that right it's made its return you
[1:24:40] feel its power you feel the anointing of
[1:24:43] it
[1:24:43] we made our return just like there's a
[1:24:46] fish
[1:24:48] a fist called a salmon
[1:24:51] that every four years
[1:24:54] it begins to make a journey that's
[1:24:56] impossible you didn't know where we were
[1:24:58] going
[1:24:59] but these sisters used to live up there
[1:25:01] in Washington Washington State and they
[1:25:03] would tell us they were telling us this
[1:25:05] just this week
[1:25:07] said man whenever spring will come up
[1:25:09] through air I know salmon said to get
[1:25:11] the stinking over there they'd be just
[1:25:12] dying there's a beautiful stream right
[1:25:14] beside Mount Baker camp and those salmon
[1:25:16] would run up there you see because they
[1:25:18] were birthed in fresh water but they
[1:25:20] spend their life out there at Sea they
[1:25:23] spend their life out there at Sea and
[1:25:25] they spend thousands and thousands of
[1:25:27] miles of energies they travel 50 miles a
[1:25:30] day Upstream they can jump 10 feet in
[1:25:32] the air
[1:25:33] just to give back to their home place
[1:25:36] you see something enters a homing
[1:25:38] Instinct on the inside of those salmon
[1:25:40] that's telling them that they've got to
[1:25:43] go back there they've got to go back to
[1:25:45] their home you see they were birthed in
[1:25:47] fresh water so they got to go back to
[1:25:49] fresh water let me tell you the salt of
[1:25:52] the world can never hold me
[1:25:55] but I was born in the fresh Revival and
[1:25:58] William Branham said every generation
[1:26:00] has got its Fresh Prince fresh chance at
[1:26:03] the word of God
[1:26:05] see they knew they were going back up
[1:26:07] there to die they'd travel all their
[1:26:09] miles to go all the way back up there
[1:26:11] and just to die but it was worth it for
[1:26:14] all them eggs when they were in their
[1:26:15] spawning to give birth to the next life
[1:26:17] but you didn't return to die
[1:26:21] he returned to live
[1:26:25] Jordan Martin didn't leave everything
[1:26:27] behind him just to come here and die he
[1:26:30] brought his family into this message to
[1:26:32] live
[1:26:34] I know what it's like to be a dead
[1:26:36] sinner but I know what it's like to be
[1:26:39] alive in Christ Jesus
[1:26:46] Hallelujah I know what it was like to
[1:26:48] have the World by its tail but there
[1:26:50] ain't nobody that can do me like King
[1:26:53] Jesus
[1:26:58] how Israel get back here in her Homeland
[1:27:02] when she was brought back there on their
[1:27:04] wings of an eagle and they said to her
[1:27:06] are you returning back here just to die
[1:27:08] they said oh no we're returning back
[1:27:11] here to see our Messiah and the first
[1:27:13] time in over 2 000 years you see the
[1:27:16] six-point star of David flying the
[1:27:18] oldest flag that there is
[1:27:22] and the same night
[1:27:24] and the same night that Israel became a
[1:27:27] nation our Prophet was in a cave
[1:27:30] was in a cave and receiving his
[1:27:32] Commission
[1:27:34] to return you to return you brother
[1:27:37] Jonathan you wasn't even in the picture
[1:27:40] according to your mind but God had a
[1:27:43] prophet
[1:27:45] God had a prophet receiving a message
[1:27:47] that would turn brother Timothy right
[1:27:50] back to his inheritance
[1:27:55] come on somebody where where would
[1:27:59] Gabrielle borlavon be today if a message
[1:28:02] hadn't came by her way
[1:28:07] Hallelujah
[1:28:10] Hallelujah
[1:28:12] that's what William Branham said he's a
[1:28:14] national forest put Israel back in her
[1:28:17] Homeland he's a national forest will put
[1:28:19] the World Council of the church in the
[1:28:22] world Council of churches he said but
[1:28:24] it'll be the power of God that'll put
[1:28:26] the people back in the bride's position
[1:28:29] don't you see what this word has done
[1:28:31] it's put you right back in place
[1:28:34] oh Lord have mercy it's a good thing
[1:28:37] this thing's nailed down good I pray
[1:28:38] tear it down tonight hallelujah it's
[1:28:41] what the message says done it's returned
[1:28:44] us back
[1:28:46] I ain't afraid about so he's speaking
[1:28:48] because I know that there's a God that
[1:28:51] has made a return and somewhere more
[1:28:53] than able to take it
[1:28:56] Hallelujah I ain't scared about brother
[1:28:59] Ron's report I know we've had a return
[1:29:04] I don't care how far you are I don't
[1:29:07] care how bad you hate me I don't care
[1:29:09] how bad you hate me screaming and I
[1:29:11] don't care how bad you hate me for
[1:29:13] preaching the message as long as I'm
[1:29:16] here I'm gonna preach that you have the
[1:29:19] ability to get the same power that
[1:29:23] little Mary got
[1:29:29] come on Satan do your lunch to this
[1:29:31] message but we'll rise up higher and
[1:29:34] greater than we ever have before
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:41] Hallelujah I was birthed here
[1:29:43] I know what it's like
[1:29:45] I know what it's like
[1:29:47] the message put us in our place brother
[1:29:50] Brandon said in Jehovah Jireh he said
[1:29:51] now he said to believe the word is to
[1:29:54] receive the word and let it become life
[1:29:56] he said now God's showing here how he
[1:30:00] was confirming the Covenant he said it
[1:30:02] has to be that way the church not an
[1:30:04] organization not a denomination but the
[1:30:07] individual and God has became the same
[1:30:09] spirit and that's God's purpose in the
[1:30:12] beginning that Adam and Eve Was the Same
[1:30:15] Spirit so to believe the word is to
[1:30:18] receive the word
[1:30:20] so to believe the word is to receive the
[1:30:22] word and let it become life so you could
[1:30:26] say I have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:28] I have his Spirit but you recognize that
[1:30:32] if you have his Spirit there is a
[1:30:35] promise that is connected that is
[1:30:37] carried along with the Covenant of his
[1:30:40] spirit
[1:30:42] you know that
[1:30:46] you got his Spirit right
[1:30:48] so if you've got a spirit you know that
[1:30:50] there's a promise connected to it
[1:30:52] come on somebody I'm talking to you if
[1:30:55] you've got his Spirit you know there's a
[1:30:57] promise connected to it well what is it
[1:30:59] brother Andrew it's this promise that
[1:31:01] the words that I do shall you do also so
[1:31:05] when you received his Spirit whether
[1:31:07] you're five years old or a hundred years
[1:31:09] old the words that I do shall he do also
[1:31:12] what are you operating in You're simply
[1:31:15] operating in a channel that the Holy
[1:31:17] Ghost has destined you to operate in
[1:31:19] nobody else can operate here
[1:31:23] there was a lot of people in Moses's day
[1:31:25] that tried to operate in the channel
[1:31:27] that he was destined to operate in even
[1:31:30] his mom and daddy tried to give him
[1:31:31] their own experience and tell him but
[1:31:33] you see it had to be inspired to him
[1:31:36] that he would work there and when he
[1:31:38] began to move into the channel you begin
[1:31:40] to see the same Authority that was back
[1:31:43] there in the Garden of Eden be placed
[1:31:46] right into Moses his life what was it it
[1:31:49] was the creative word that was back
[1:31:52] there in the Garden of Eden it's that
[1:31:54] creative word that was operating through
[1:31:57] a man the son of man Ministry through
[1:31:59] Moses what was it he gathered the
[1:32:02] inspiration
[1:32:04] the same Authority that was all the way
[1:32:07] back there in the Garden of Eden Moses
[1:32:10] didn't want to deliver them people
[1:32:16] I'm a message person God loves me he
[1:32:20] didn't want to deliver them
[1:32:25] well you say we're reaching I'll give
[1:32:27] you the quote for it
[1:32:28] he said Hey Brother random said and I've
[1:32:30] heard but now I see he said well he said
[1:32:33] Moses didn't want to deliver them
[1:32:36] he said but something began to post say
[1:32:39] and get into a man
[1:32:43] he began to vindicate to him and show
[1:32:46] him that these things was going to
[1:32:48] happen he didn't want to deliver those
[1:32:51] people
[1:32:52] but God spoke to him
[1:32:54] so he's up there on that mountain ain't
[1:32:57] no way I'm going back down there to them
[1:33:00] a bunch of crazy Jews down there the
[1:33:02] last thing they know about me is I'm a
[1:33:03] murderer
[1:33:04] I don't want to deliver them I'm living
[1:33:07] a good life up here he'd heard about a
[1:33:10] great Jehovah that Abraham had met but
[1:33:12] when he got up there at the pillar of
[1:33:14] fire he could say I have heard of thee
[1:33:16] by the hearing of the ear but now I see
[1:33:19] and when he got up there inspiration
[1:33:22] struck him and he said what he was
[1:33:24] supposed to say
[1:33:27] you see Moses didn't want to do this but
[1:33:30] God Paul said it on the inside of him
[1:33:32] and he Vindicated Moses's call
[1:33:36] let me tell you there's a lot of things
[1:33:38] that you didn't want to do but when the
[1:33:40] pulsation of the Holy Ghost began to
[1:33:42] move in a service like this it makes you
[1:33:45] do things that you wouldn't necessarily
[1:33:47] do
[1:33:48] and when Moses got out there and he's
[1:33:51] got the two million Jews with him he's
[1:33:53] got them all behind him and he goes to a
[1:33:55] crisis and there's a Red Sea in front of
[1:33:58] him what does he do
[1:34:00] inspiration strikes him
[1:34:03] the same inspiration that hits him while
[1:34:07] he's back there in Egypt and he calls
[1:34:09] for fleas and he calls for flies and he
[1:34:11] calls her frogs and he goes to all and
[1:34:13] the same inspiration he didn't even know
[1:34:16] what he was saying he said stand still
[1:34:19] and see the salvation of the Lord what
[1:34:23] was he operating in he was operating in
[1:34:26] the inspiration of the channel of the
[1:34:28] Holy Ghost
[1:34:31] hey
[1:34:33] let me put it in plain language to you
[1:34:35] Hattie you don't know what you're saying
[1:34:38] you don't know what you're saying but
[1:34:41] you're saying the right thing Moses you
[1:34:43] don't know what you're saying but you're
[1:34:45] saying the right thing you may not see
[1:34:47] the waters parted yet but you're saying
[1:34:50] the right thing it's well I don't see my
[1:34:52] loved one come in yet but you're saying
[1:34:54] the right thing I don't see healing
[1:34:56] coming but you're saying the right thing
[1:34:57] you're under the inspiration of the Holy
[1:35:00] Ghost and job said I have heard of thee
[1:35:03] by the hearing of the ear
[1:35:06] but now I see
[1:35:14] you can take all of these Bibles every
[1:35:16] one of these Bibles right here in the
[1:35:18] fly leaf of my Bible I got every one of
[1:35:21] them Spencer children and every one of
[1:35:23] these Fraser children wrote down in the
[1:35:25] fly leaf of my Bibles
[1:35:27] I didn't know how Gabriel Spencer was
[1:35:30] going to get here I didn't I didn't know
[1:35:31] how Malachi Spencer would get held to
[1:35:33] where he was or charity and Michael and
[1:35:36] Alexa but I trusted the word of the Lord
[1:35:41] I didn't know how he was going to do it
[1:35:43] but I'd heard about a god they could but
[1:35:46] now I can say I see him clearly
[1:35:51] Hallelujah
[1:35:52] I just telling somebody else's stories
[1:35:56] I'm telling my story
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:01] well brother Ron's got some of the
[1:36:02] greatest stories that he could tell
[1:36:04] about miracles it ain't just about
[1:36:06] brother Ron having his story it's about
[1:36:08] you having your story
[1:36:10] I confess the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:36:13] Ghost Field me I believed on the Lord
[1:36:15] Jesus Christ and he saved me
[1:36:19] you're gonna have a story to tell Lily
[1:36:20] he's the god of you
[1:36:26] he's the god of you
[1:36:30] I don't think it's going to be too hard
[1:36:32] for somebody to reach over there and lay
[1:36:35] their hands upon our brother or our
[1:36:37] sister and watch the miraculous take
[1:36:39] place
[1:36:40] we've watched tumors disappear that's
[1:36:43] not just for William Branham it's in
[1:36:45] this body
[1:36:46] we've seen cysts disappear we've seen
[1:36:49] cancers fall off
[1:36:53] what is it it's hard to believe
[1:36:56] I've seen people that said they'd never
[1:36:58] move in a service like this but because
[1:37:01] they recognize that the Trump and call
[1:37:03] it come over them they heard the sound
[1:37:05] foreign
[1:37:06] that the Bible said that forever the
[1:37:09] land is mine
[1:37:11] it can't be sold I want to tell to you
[1:37:14] Satan you have no legal Authority on the
[1:37:18] bride's body cancer you have no

[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:16] you're not a servant
[1:38:19] you're a son
[1:38:24] see those that are working in the field
[1:38:25] that are servants heard the same thing
[1:38:28] that you heard
[1:38:30] they heard the same message you heard
[1:38:32] but it didn't do nothing to them
[1:38:35] but when it come across the sun's ears
[1:38:38] I know what that sounds like
[1:38:46] what happened
[1:38:48] in 1958 when William Brandon preached
[1:38:50] the Oneness of unity
[1:38:54] he's standing there and he's you listen
[1:38:57] to him
[1:38:58] man he is battling in this service
[1:39:02] and I'm not battling I don't know why
[1:39:03] I'm here
[1:39:04] but I'm going to tell it to you anyhow
[1:39:07] but he's standing in his battling he's
[1:39:09] battling he's battling one of the
[1:39:12] greatest Supernatural events is getting
[1:39:13] that's going to transpire throughout the
[1:39:15] message is getting ready to happen
[1:39:18] but he's battling to get through this
[1:39:22] bound up crowd
[1:39:24] they won't amen the word they won't
[1:39:26] receive the word they won't preach with
[1:39:28] him he said now look he said I believe
[1:39:31] in being conservative he said but
[1:39:33] conservateness brings us superstitious
[1:39:36] superstitious spirit with it
[1:39:38] he said oh Lord I pray you sit in your
[1:39:42] spirit and loosen up this crowd he said
[1:39:45] as soon as he began to say that there
[1:39:47] came a wind through there and it sounded
[1:39:50] like pipe organs rocking the building it
[1:39:53] blew his coattail up in the air people
[1:39:55] witness I witnessed the very
[1:39:57] Supernatural power of the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:01] some of the greatest Miracles that
[1:40:03] transpired
[1:40:04] transpired it right there
[1:40:13] well I don't know if I can brother
[1:40:14] Andrew
[1:40:19] Moses knew he had access he was a
[1:40:22] prophet of the Lord he didn't even know
[1:40:24] what he was saying but because he
[1:40:26] recognized his position as a prophet he
[1:40:30] could stand there and say those things
[1:40:32] Hattie didn't know what she was saying
[1:40:34] she could have asked for a million
[1:40:36] dollars but she said the right thing she
[1:40:38] asked for her two sons
[1:40:41] if them two sons would have walked out I
[1:40:44] wouldn't be here today but when he said
[1:40:46] I give you your son's Hattie
[1:40:49] Hallelujah I give you your son's Hattie
[1:40:52] they dropped on her knees and because
[1:40:55] those two boys are a part of the third
[1:40:58] pool
[1:41:00] you're here today
[1:41:02] I'm here today
[1:41:09] too many people are afraid to the third
[1:41:11] Point think it's can't it can't be for
[1:41:12] them
[1:41:15] it is for every one of you
[1:41:21] I ain't seen no squirrels manifested
[1:41:23] I'll be honest with you
[1:41:25] I ain't asked for squirrels
[1:41:29] but I believe if I had need of them I
[1:41:32] could ask for them and they'd be in this
[1:41:34] room right now
[1:41:36] but to be honest I don't need no
[1:41:37] squirrels in here brother Thomas
[1:41:40] has greater needs than I have than
[1:41:42] squirrels
[1:41:45] come on somebody come on somebody I
[1:41:48] don't need to resurrect a little fish
[1:41:50] but I believe that I could if I needed
[1:41:52] to but my motive is in these young
[1:41:55] people
[1:41:56] motive is in your healing and I believe
[1:42:00] that I could say the right word brother
[1:42:02] Chris
[1:42:07] why can't we have it why can't we
[1:42:09] receive it
[1:42:12] if God before us brother Joel then where
[1:42:15] be all of his miracles here right here
[1:42:20] oh somebody give a witness to the holy
[1:42:22] ghost that it's in the room
[1:42:26] it's our Jubilee
[1:42:27] [Applause]
[1:42:33] what is it
[1:42:35] it was the same power
[1:42:38] that came and worked in Abraham's body
[1:42:41] that Abraham Abraham even though he was
[1:42:43] as good as his dead brother Doug
[1:42:46] he received a promise and he staggered
[1:42:49] not at the promise of God but was
[1:42:51] faithful giving praise unto the Lord
[1:42:54] what was it
[1:42:56] what was it
[1:42:57] who was he fellowshipping up there with
[1:42:59] brother Jim he was fellowshipping with
[1:43:01] Elohim
[1:43:03] he was fellowshipping with the
[1:43:05] self-existing one
[1:43:08] the same one
[1:43:10] the same one that was going to meet him
[1:43:13] 15 years from this moment and meet him
[1:43:16] up on Mount Moriah and he would not just
[1:43:18] be Elohim but he would be Jehovah Jireh
[1:43:21] he would be his provider he was
[1:43:24] fellowshipping with him
[1:43:27] and the one that made the deposit was
[1:43:30] good enough to take care of Isaac in the
[1:43:32] future
[1:43:34] what are you fellowshipping with you're
[1:43:37] not fellowshipping with me you're not
[1:43:39] just fellowshipping with my thoughts you
[1:43:41] are fellowshipping with the mind of God
[1:43:45] what's making you believe that all
[1:43:47] things are possible you're
[1:43:48] fellowshipping with an Angel
[1:43:54] only certain people know this but I'm
[1:43:56] going to tell it right now because I
[1:43:57] feel the same one standing here but
[1:43:59] about a month and a half ago I was
[1:44:01] standing on that little platform
[1:44:03] and I stood there and I said that El
[1:44:06] Shadi I has made a deposit unto Abraham
[1:44:10] you probably remember I turned around
[1:44:12] and I saw an angel standing right there
[1:44:17] I saw an angel standing right there what
[1:44:20] was he saying to you that the angel has
[1:44:23] made a deposit the seventh angel has
[1:44:26] made a deposit to the bride's body that
[1:44:29] you cannot fail the first he fell but
[1:44:32] this eve cannot fail because she's
[1:44:35] predestinated not to you can't go down
[1:44:38] in destruction you can't go down in
[1:44:40] defeat the angel has said you're going
[1:44:43] to be there
[1:44:51] who is this
[1:44:52] who is this Melchizedek I say it's none
[1:44:55] other than our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:57] it was the same one that Abraham was
[1:44:59] fellowshipping with he was the same one
[1:45:01] that William Branham was fellowshipping
[1:45:03] with it's the same one that you feel in
[1:45:05] the room right now don't you feel it
[1:45:07] brother Timmy you feel it in the room
[1:45:08] you feel the reaction and your amen has
[1:45:12] brought into where your need is
[1:45:14] and I don't know what you're facing in
[1:45:16] your life but I believe that this is
[1:45:19] your Liberty that the angel is here to
[1:45:22] prove himself that he's still able to do
[1:45:24] the exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:45:26] that you could ever ask or think
[1:45:28] according to the power that worketh in
[1:45:30] US
[1:45:34] thank you
[1:45:34] [Applause]
[1:45:36] what was it Paul tapped into a in the
[1:45:39] book of Ephesians he tapped in and
[1:45:41] paralleled it all the way back there in
[1:45:43] the Book of Joshua that when William
[1:45:45] Branham comes and he preached the Feast
[1:45:47] of the trumpet he comes there and he's
[1:45:49] trying to preach it but the angel tells
[1:45:52] him this is for the Jews but he comes
[1:45:55] and preached the Feast of the trumpet
[1:45:57] and what does William Branham do in that
[1:45:59] message he lays out all the boundaries
[1:46:01] for the Bride of Jesus Christ saying
[1:46:04] this is your Authority this is your
[1:46:06] possession this is yours
[1:46:09] and what did Paul say in Ephesians
[1:46:11] chapter 1 that he predestinated us under
[1:46:14] the adoptions of sons so this is not the
[1:46:17] hour of hoping that it will be but this
[1:46:20] is the hour of manifested Sons and
[1:46:22] Daughters of God
[1:46:25] you're not a servant
[1:46:27] you're not a Slave
[1:46:30] because a servant of God is not in the
[1:46:33] house forever
[1:46:34] but the son does
[1:46:38] because the Jesus would go on to say
[1:46:40] that whom the son is set free
[1:46:43] it's free indeed
[1:46:45] you see when they heard the sound
[1:46:51] they heard the sound
[1:46:54] they knew they were free
[1:46:57] they knew they were free
[1:47:00] they knew they were free
[1:47:03] what did William Bradham do when he's
[1:47:04] standing there he's preaching a very
[1:47:05] powerful message
[1:47:06] on birth veins how this world has went
[1:47:09] through all of these birth pains and
[1:47:10] it's it's going through these things and
[1:47:12] he's getting ready and you remember the
[1:47:13] story and he's standing there and he's
[1:47:14] got his wife's just given a new Bible
[1:47:16] and he's trying to find the scripture
[1:47:17] where the woman's in travail going
[1:47:20] through these birth pains
[1:47:22] and a priest comes over and hands him
[1:47:25] his Bible
[1:47:27] his Bible and says Be steady son God is
[1:47:31] fixing to move
[1:47:33] what was it William Branham comes right
[1:47:36] back after that and preaches to us this
[1:47:39] day this scripture is fulfilled that the
[1:47:43] spirit of the Lord is upon me for he
[1:47:46] hath anointed me to preach to those that
[1:47:48] are in captives that they are set free
[1:47:51] to bind up the Brokenhearted so what is
[1:47:54] this you are under an anointing to say
[1:47:58] that this is your Liberty what is the
[1:48:01] message brother Angel it's your Liberty
[1:48:05] what is the third pull it's your Liberty
[1:48:08] what is this message it's the opening of
[1:48:11] the word
[1:48:15] oh Hallelujah
[1:48:18] let me shout it from the tops of my
[1:48:20] lungs go free
[1:48:23] go free
[1:48:25] God free
[1:48:28] go free
[1:48:30] what happened in high school what
[1:48:33] transpired in college the complexes that
[1:48:35] were stacked up you're free from them
[1:48:38] Satan has no power over you in the name
[1:48:41] of Jesus Christ the authority of the
[1:48:44] word and says you're healed says you're
[1:48:46] delivered says you're made whole
[1:48:50] [Applause]
[1:48:52] glory to God
[1:49:01] that's a big guy right there and I was
[1:49:04] never dumb enough to fight him
[1:49:09] I got all the ice cream he got all the
[1:49:11] steak containers
[1:49:16] it's starting to catch up to me too
[1:49:18] ice cream's catching up
[1:49:21] if I'm going to have a weakness that's a
[1:49:23] weakness I have
[1:49:25] but as strong as that guy was
[1:49:27] he could never keep me
[1:49:29] from this
[1:49:34] it was a time in my life I needed a
[1:49:36] strong man like him
[1:49:39] I need a strong man from him like him
[1:49:41] I was on my way
[1:49:43] from running away from this message and
[1:49:46] running away from this truth run away
[1:49:48] from my family
[1:49:49] bags packed baby I'm gone
[1:49:54] I was in a real spot
[1:50:01] yeah I live the best of lives
[1:50:04] I lived in a preacher's home
[1:50:06] heard the message every day

[1:51:38] brother says
[1:51:40] when he's talking to the angel
[1:51:42] and the angels showing him the vision of
[1:51:44] the 30 pulls
[1:51:47] you remember William Branham got in
[1:51:48] trouble and I'm closing

[1:51:55] closing
[1:52:00] you remember he got in trouble
[1:52:02] we're showing all those Pentecostal
[1:52:04] preachers up here on the bank how to
[1:52:06] fish
[1:52:07] he was telling them how the gift
[1:52:08] operated
[1:52:10] but he told him
[1:52:12] he said you can't teach Pentecostal baby
[1:52:15] Supernatural things
[1:52:19] you can't teach Pentecostal baby
[1:52:21] Supernatural things
[1:52:23] let me tell you you can try with all
[1:52:24] your mind to teach them the Supernatural
[1:52:27] and they'll never receive it but what
[1:52:29] they need is this third pole
[1:52:32] but what did he get when he made that
[1:52:35] third pull he got the greatest fish he
[1:52:39] got the rainbow trout he got a covenant
[1:52:43] people when he made the third poll he
[1:52:45] got you
[1:52:47] he got you and then when he begins to
[1:52:50] tell this when he begins to tell this in
[1:52:52] 1964 64 in his unfailing words of
[1:52:55] Promise he begins to talk about a woman
[1:52:58] by the name of Hattie Walzem that was
[1:53:00] there in Phoenix that was sitting there
[1:53:02] and had cancer of the heart and cancer
[1:53:04] throughout her body she's told her
[1:53:06] husband said even if I die right here in
[1:53:10] the prayer line you send me on through
[1:53:12] there
[1:53:13] brother random said I didn't even know
[1:53:15] what I was doing he said I walked out
[1:53:17] there and he said I laid my hands upon
[1:53:19] that dead corpse and she came back to
[1:53:22] life what was operating in the early
[1:53:24] Ministry of William Branham was the
[1:53:27] inspiration of the third pool
[1:53:29] what was Abraham tapping into it was a
[1:53:32] third poll to change his body
[1:53:35] what is this Jubilee it's your Liberty
[1:53:38] to take a body change
[1:53:42] it's your Liberty to tell Satan take
[1:53:46] your dirty hands off of God's Property I

[1:54:55] surface failures on top of failures
[1:55:00] but Jesus was looking past the surface
[1:55:05] and it seemed that she had
[1:55:06] predestination

[1:55:38] ready to be number seven

[1:55:42] surface for her but he went beyond the

[1:55:50] knew
