[43:55] in a sermon if you can really
[43:59] grasp what is transpiring in these
[44:01] places

[52:55] us and
[52:56] what an incredible gifted you are here
[52:59] at the body of jesus christ
[53:01] amen we were asked to do a funeral this
[53:05] week and
[53:06] and uh for for those that know or don't
[53:09] know
[53:11] there was a girl 25 years old she
[53:13] actually grew up here in this church
[53:16] brother charlie and and
[53:19] granddaughter amanda was her mother's
[53:22] name but
[53:25] she she grew up here set about right
[53:28] there
[53:29] uh in the services and she grew up and
[53:34] and uh then i got a call out of the blue
[53:37] one day that she wanted to get married
[53:40] and i think she was between 15 16 years
[53:42] old when she got married
[53:44] and i performed the ceremony before
[53:47] church one night
[53:49] and uh it was a full-blown deal i didn't
[53:51] realize what it was going to be she was
[53:52] in her wedding gown and
[53:54] he was in a nice little suit there and
[53:57] they had flowers and everything and
[53:59] and we married them and stepped out on
[54:01] the out on the porch and some of you
[54:04] were coming in
[54:05] for the service and and we just had a
[54:07] wedding here
[54:09] and so i i had not heard a word from
[54:12] them
[54:12] for for 10 years and i didn't know it
[54:16] but this last week
[54:18] she died in in martha jefferson
[54:20] university
[54:22] and they asked me to do the funeral we
[54:24] haven't done a funeral inside since the
[54:26] covid
[54:27] situation so i offered yesterday was a
[54:30] very beautiful day and so i
[54:31] offered to preach the funeral on the
[54:33] steps and so
[54:35] they they were motorcycle people
[54:38] and so
[54:42] and so we had a about between 20 and 30
[54:47] harley-davidson's parked across the
[54:50] front and we had enough tattoos here
[54:54] yesterday
[54:57] we had enough tattoos here to to put on
[54:59] a big billboard somewhere another
[55:02] and uh and so i just preached to them
[55:06] jesus that's all i knew to preach and i
[55:08] preached
[55:09] to them jesus and so we want to pray for
[55:12] that family that god would do a work for
[55:14] them
[55:15] let me just say let me let me just be
[55:17] very clear with this
[55:19] you can live in the church door
[55:24] and miss it
[55:27] and as i stood on the steps i thought
[55:29] about the grace of god
[55:33] and uh here's a thought that i can't i i
[55:35] i got up with it
[55:37] yesterday morning because i think i
[55:39] think kind of deeply about some of these
[55:41] things
[55:43] it didn't have to be this way
[55:46] it didn't hurt you'd you shouldn't have
[55:48] to die because of a dirty
[55:51] heroin needle you know
[55:54] it just didn't have to be this way
[55:57] and and i and i want to say this to our
[55:59] young people
[56:00] if your friends are trying to pull you
[56:03] into that world
[56:05] they're not your friends
[56:19] and so i i'm not throwing a stone and
[56:21] i'm not being judgmental
[56:23] but it don't have to be that way and
[56:26] there's a better life and i would say
[56:29] there's a better life
[56:31] and so we just thank god for his mercy
[56:34] and his grace
[56:35] amen amen
[56:40] we've been about a year now in our
[56:42] journey
[56:43] with with the diagnosis of cancer
[56:47] it takes a lot of funny turns and then
[56:50] it's turned sometimes there's good days
[56:52] bad days uh sometimes there's good weeks
[56:55] and sometimes there's bad weeks
[56:58] this week was a very weary week i would
[57:00] say the weariness of
[57:03] of the journey has kind of been a little
[57:06] difficult over the last couple of weeks
[57:09] i actually see the cancer doctor
[57:11] tomorrow and so
[57:13] if you would pray for that but you know
[57:15] god knows how to do things
[57:18] and somebody knowed how to do something
[57:20] very special
[57:21] and i i'd like to share it with you this
[57:23] morning if i could
[57:25] maybe brother andrew and brother brother
[57:27] matthew brother william and brother
[57:29] matthew will you will you come and hold
[57:32] this up for me
[57:42] [Laughter]
[57:46] hallelujah now you know
[57:51] you can turn the set off whatever you
[57:52] want to do but
[57:56] i'm a preacher that loves boxing
[57:59] and so now i've got a belt
[58:12] not this modern day stuff now but
[58:17] but somebody i don't know who it is if
[58:19] you'll come forward or tell me or
[58:20] whatever i'd like to thank you very much
[58:23] but the other day i got boxes in the
[58:26] mail
[58:27] and i i took it in i said what's connie
[58:29] ordered she's ordered a belt
[58:34] and so i you know sometimes i do a sneak
[58:37] preview and just check what we've got
[58:39] and so
[58:40] i thought well this is a thick belt and
[58:42] so i opened it up and it was in a bag
[58:45] and
[58:46] i was probably feeling as weary as i've
[58:49] ever
[58:50] felt in my life and i pull this belt out
[58:55] and it says undefeated champion
[58:59] ronald dean spencer
[59:08] [Applause]
[59:13] devil defeater i will not accept
[59:17] nothing but full victory

[59:24] scripture
[59:26] and show no mercy
[59:30] to whoever we give you a great big hand
[59:32] thank you
[59:36] [Applause]

[1:00:16] and
[1:00:17] they had me dancing with it and over my
[1:00:20] shoulders and
[1:00:23] and maybe on a day where i feel a little
[1:00:25] better i may dance with it a little bit
[1:00:27] or so
[1:00:28] amen if you will help me this morning
[1:00:30] and preaching today

[1:00:36] amen we love you with all of our hearts
[1:00:39] and we'd like to say happy easter to you
[1:00:42] and this is a great week and
[1:00:45] we remember the resurrection and we're
[1:00:48] looking
[1:00:48] at the body change and we're getting
[1:00:50] ready to step into it and so
[1:00:52] amen god bless you i apologize for
[1:00:54] taking a few minutes but
[1:00:55] now you know why i wanted you to be
[1:00:57] seated for a moment let's stand to our
[1:00:59] feet this morning
[1:01:06] i'd like for you to turn with me to john
[1:01:08] chapter 20
[1:01:10] and verse 11. and i have a subject i
[1:01:14] just won't i
[1:01:14] i don't think i'll be long but i just
[1:01:17] want to share with you on my heart
[1:01:20] that's especially after
[1:01:24] last night's happenings i feel even more
[1:01:26] so
[1:01:27] last week we we spoke on the woman that
[1:01:29] washed jesus's feet
[1:01:32] and we we we talked about jesus being in
[1:01:35] the room
[1:01:36] and he was in the room here last week
[1:01:39] he was in the room last night that was a
[1:01:41] wonderful song he was in the room
[1:01:44] and and sometimes in speaking a sermon
[1:01:47] like last week it gets sticky for just a
[1:01:49] few minutes on
[1:01:51] on who has who who we're impressed with
[1:01:54] and so
[1:01:55] and so we you know and we just
[1:01:59] named a few occupations of things that
[1:02:01] people are impressed with
[1:02:03] that jesus wasn't impressed with you
[1:02:06] understand that that jesus wasn't
[1:02:08] impressed with
[1:02:10] now i want to take you to another lady
[1:02:14] today
[1:02:15] mary magdalene and
[1:02:18] this is a subject that i've just been
[1:02:21] very cautious about how i deal with her
[1:02:24] because she's she's she's actually named
[1:02:29] more and matthew mark luke and john
[1:02:32] than any other woman
[1:02:36] was named in those four books mary
[1:02:39] magdalene
[1:02:40] was named more than any other woman
[1:02:45] so she has an important place amen
[1:02:49] saint john chapter 20 and verse 11.
[1:02:53] are you are you there with me this
[1:02:55] morning amen
[1:02:57] but mary stood without at the sepulcher
[1:03:02] weeping and as she wept
[1:03:05] she stooped down and looked into the
[1:03:07] sepulchre
[1:03:09] and seeth two angels in the white
[1:03:13] city the one at the at the head
[1:03:16] and the other at the feet where the body
[1:03:19] of jesus had lain
[1:03:21] and they said unto her woman
[1:03:24] why weepest thou she said unto them
[1:03:28] because they have taken away my lord
[1:03:32] and i know not where they have laid him
[1:03:37] and when she had thus said she turned
[1:03:40] herself
[1:03:40] back and saw jesus standing
[1:03:44] and knew not that it was jesus
[1:03:47] and jesus saith unto her woman
[1:03:50] why weepest thou whom seek us thou
[1:03:54] and she supposed him to be the gardener
[1:03:58] and saith unto him sir
[1:04:01] if thou had borne him hence
[1:04:05] tell me where thou has laid him
[1:04:09] and i will take him away and jesus
[1:04:12] saith unto her mary
[1:04:17] and she turned herself and saith unto
[1:04:19] him rapona
[1:04:21] which is to say master and jesus saith
[1:04:25] unto her
[1:04:26] touch me not for i am not yet ascended
[1:04:29] to my father
[1:04:31] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[1:04:36] i ascend unto my father and your father
[1:04:41] and to my god and your god
[1:04:46] mary magdalene came and told the
[1:04:49] disciples
[1:04:51] that she had seen the lord
[1:04:54] and that he had spoken these things
[1:04:57] unto her you may be seated may the lord
[1:05:01] bless the reading of his word
[1:05:06] amen is everybody comfortable
[1:05:09] amen it's good to a sydney
[1:05:14] brother branham says this and
[1:05:17] and he quotes history i'll take brother
[1:05:20] brandon's quote in history
[1:05:23] he said after mary magdalene said my
[1:05:26] history
[1:05:27] run before them and said what
[1:05:31] has he done what evil did he do
[1:05:36] she stopped the possession
[1:05:40] and said what did he do was evil
[1:05:45] what did he do that was evil
[1:05:48] has he done nothing but preached the
[1:05:51] gospel
[1:05:52] to the poor has he done nothing but
[1:05:56] healed the sick
[1:05:57] and raised the dead the very signs of
[1:06:01] the living god is in him
[1:06:05] he could condemn you
[1:06:09] and they slapped her in the mouth and
[1:06:12] said would you
[1:06:12] listen to the ill-famed woman in the
[1:06:15] stead of your priest
[1:06:19] there you are your bishop
[1:06:24] there you are same thing today
[1:06:27] that's right yes
[1:06:30] now when he done all of this and he
[1:06:33] proved himself and what he was and
[1:06:36] and put it down to them and said if
[1:06:39] if i'm not he then who are you
[1:06:45] if you can condemn me of sin
[1:06:48] if i'm anywhere wrong in the word
[1:06:52] you show me brother branham was more
[1:06:55] than just quoting history
[1:06:59] i want 100 participation he was doing
[1:07:03] more than quoting history
[1:07:09] sin is unbelief
[1:07:12] they had to get rid of him out of their
[1:07:14] sight
[1:07:16] now to get rid of them out of their
[1:07:17] sight they hated him
[1:07:20] so bad
[1:07:23] because he tore up their organizations
[1:07:29] to rid him out of their sight they
[1:07:31] buried him and
[1:07:32] rolled a great big denominational stone
[1:07:34] over the door
[1:07:36] so he would be sure not to rise up again
[1:07:42] as we look at this week and we look at
[1:07:44] it in history there's
[1:07:46] no way in the world that we can
[1:07:49] rebuild and bring to you the mind of the
[1:07:53] atmosphere
[1:07:54] that was taken place in the government
[1:07:57] of that day
[1:07:58] in the church world of that day
[1:08:02] the atmosphere of calling for his
[1:08:05] his crucifixion the atmosphere that you
[1:08:09] would
[1:08:09] beat a body a
[1:08:12] human body like that they would loose on
[1:08:17] him and
[1:08:17] beat jesus to where he was
[1:08:20] unrecognizable as a human being
[1:08:24] and yet with him standing there with
[1:08:26] those with those incredible stripes on
[1:08:29] him
[1:08:30] and a crown of thorns on his head the
[1:08:32] church world
[1:08:34] chose barabbas over jesus
[1:08:38] [Applause]
[1:08:39] you think of the insanity
[1:08:43] he raised their dead he healed their
[1:08:45] sick
[1:08:46] he fed their thousands
[1:08:52] are you with me he had no home
[1:08:55] he had no church
[1:08:58] are you with me there was no army
[1:09:02] that was marching against rome or the
[1:09:05] sanhedrin
[1:09:06] council the pharisees and the sadducees
[1:09:09] the holy people
[1:09:11] he fulfilled every prophecy in the old
[1:09:14] testament
[1:09:16] he fulfilled it and they refused to
[1:09:19] recognize of what
[1:09:21] god was doing i'd say we're there again
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:25] i'd say we're at a supercharged moment
[1:09:29] again of the atmosphere
[1:09:31] where they've crucified the word
[1:09:36] our politicians are ashamed of of a
[1:09:39] painting of moses
[1:09:41] over top of them this week they're
[1:09:44] trying to get rid of the picture of
[1:09:45] moses
[1:09:46] in the hall of congress
[1:09:50] well they kicked him out of the schools
[1:09:54] they've done away with the bibles in the
[1:09:57] schools
[1:09:58] they've done away with the ten
[1:10:00] commandments they want
[1:10:02] no real prayer in our in our in our
[1:10:05] in our washington we're the nation
[1:10:10] we're the nation that the prophet of god
[1:10:13] came out of we were
[1:10:16] a christian nation not now
[1:10:21] we don't have that same identity now
[1:10:24] i am an american i'm proud to be an
[1:10:28] american
[1:10:30] this is where i was born brother graham
[1:10:33] said i am
[1:10:34] i stand with her in her glory and i
[1:10:36] stand with her inner shame
[1:10:39] but do you remember the last vision
[1:10:43] was that she was bombed
[1:10:46] so she's not an end time player
[1:10:50] so don't get comfortable with the
[1:10:52] america that you even have now
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:54] [Applause]
[1:10:57] there's a rapture that's to come don't
[1:11:00] miss it
[1:11:12] woman that comes out and stops the
[1:11:14] possession
[1:11:17] and she begins to scream what hath he
[1:11:18] done
[1:11:21] what hath he done what hath he done
[1:11:27] and they slap her they do away with her
[1:11:31] they're taking the lamb of god
[1:11:36] up on the hill to be hung on a cruel
[1:11:39] tree
[1:11:41] the greatest preacher that ever lived
[1:11:45] i think about it as i thought about it
[1:11:47] the last couple of weeks
[1:11:49] of all the believers that's ever been
[1:11:53] on the face of the earth god chose
[1:11:56] that woman
[1:12:00] i want to just gather your mind here
[1:12:02] just for a few moments
[1:12:03] in god's pre-planning
[1:12:07] in his infinite bible in the book of
[1:12:10] redemption
[1:12:14] he chooses mary magdalene
[1:12:17] to fulfill the word in so many places
[1:12:22] listen in the scripture god's not
[1:12:26] deity about the book of redemption
[1:12:30] he's chose women like rahab
[1:12:34] he's chose ruth he's chosen
[1:12:37] tamar he's chose these women
[1:12:40] of extreme ill fame to
[1:12:43] show us redemption
[1:12:47] oh now don't you get your angel wings on
[1:12:49] just for a moment
[1:12:52] all have sinned and come short of the
[1:12:54] glory of god
[1:12:56] your righteousness is as filthy rags
[1:12:59] and you were on your way to hell
[1:13:04] don't get yourself all piety for a
[1:13:06] moment listen without the blood of jesus
[1:13:08] christ
[1:13:09] you are going to hell
[1:13:23] scripture said sin is pleasurable
[1:13:26] for a season
[1:13:31] and here was a woman that was caught up
[1:13:33] because of circumstances of life
[1:13:36] we don't have too much of her history
[1:13:39] but the scripture talks about in history
[1:13:41] talks about it
[1:13:43] that she had seven demons an interesting
[1:13:46] number of demons
[1:13:50] and a prophet of god would come back and
[1:13:52] call out those demons
[1:13:55] and say what they were he said first of
[1:13:58] all
[1:13:59] she was a beautiful woman
[1:14:02] he said well brother on how did brother
[1:14:04] branham know that i'd say the same way
[1:14:05] he watched eve walk out of the garden of
[1:14:12] eden
[1:14:14] history tells us she was a beautiful
[1:14:16] woman
[1:14:18] brother branham said that she didn't
[1:14:20] even know that she had those demons
[1:14:23] i wonder how many times that people have
[1:14:26] demons in their life that lay deeply in
[1:14:30] there
[1:14:32] and they don't realize that they have
[1:14:34] demons there
[1:14:37] and it's just part of life
[1:14:43] i want to just labor this just for a
[1:14:44] moment if you will help me
[1:14:49] and you don't know if they're there
[1:14:50] until they show their face
[1:14:54] brother man said he would be preaching
[1:14:55] along and all of a sudden the
[1:14:57] countenance on people's faces
[1:15:00] would change and then they would show
[1:15:03] what they were
[1:15:05] and he said there would be and listen
[1:15:07] they're sitting in the pew they're
[1:15:08] sitting quietly
[1:15:10] and don't realize they're showing the
[1:15:12] dimension that they're feeding on
[1:15:17] sometimes if we're we're not careful we
[1:15:20] become religious
[1:15:22] and not converted
[1:15:26] there's a major difference between
[1:15:28] religious
[1:15:31] and not and converted it's two different
[1:15:35] things
[1:15:36] nicodemus was religious
[1:15:39] the woman at the well was religious
[1:15:43] and many people are religious today and
[1:15:46] they want jesus
[1:15:50] but it's a jesus of their own making.
[1:16:03] let me just give you a couple of demons
[1:16:05] that you'll know
[1:16:08] jealousy is a real green-eyed devil
[1:16:11] it won't show its color until it's put
[1:16:14] under pressure
[1:16:17] and yet it can live in some of the
[1:16:19] greatest christians
[1:16:21] and under pressure it'll come out and
[1:16:23] show its viciousness
[1:16:29] it destroys homes it destroys
[1:16:32] families
[1:16:36] it destroys marriages
[1:16:42] sure he does now your wife and husband
[1:16:46] should be your best friend in life if
[1:16:49] they're not your best friend
[1:16:51] you married the wrong person that's not
[1:16:54] my fault that's yours
[1:16:57] but your wife you guys are getting
[1:16:59] married in a few months it's coming
[1:17:01] quick
[1:17:02] you're getting married in a eight weeks
[1:17:05] nine weeks i don't have to tell you all
[1:17:07] that
[1:17:07] business but that's your best friend
[1:17:11] that's your best friend you're sitting
[1:17:14] beside your best friend brother steve
[1:17:17] and there should be supreme trust
[1:17:20] an absolute supreme trust in in you
[1:17:24] between you as mates you don't have to
[1:17:27] hold a gun to each other and go now
[1:17:29] don't you commit adultery day don't you
[1:17:31] lust
[1:17:32] don't you do anything don't
[1:17:37] are you with me now listen it would
[1:17:40] drive me crazy if i had to tell connie
[1:17:42] everywhere i was at at every moment of
[1:17:44] the day
[1:17:45] she's calling me a hundred times a day
[1:17:48] and
[1:17:48] texting me a thousand times a day first
[1:17:51] of all i couldn't live in that kind of
[1:17:56] environment
[1:17:58] first time she gets a call says we
[1:18:00] bought a truck
[1:18:01] need you to come sign for it did i ask
[1:18:04] her permission
[1:18:10] no
[1:18:16] i bought a gun this week did a caller up
[1:18:20] and say
[1:18:21] hey uh you know i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm
[1:18:24] gonna buy a gun first of all i can
[1:18:25] afford
[1:18:26] to do that i'm not crazy
[1:18:35] one of the boxes she had bought a pair
[1:18:37] of shoes
[1:18:42] so i felt it was okay to buy a gun
[1:19:03] this woman was a harlot
[1:19:11] she probably wouldn't have been welcome
[1:19:12] in any of the local churches
[1:19:15] let's just say it how it is she probably
[1:19:18] wouldn't welcome with any of the priests
[1:19:20] it probably wasn't welcome just like the
[1:19:23] woman at the well wasn't welcome
[1:19:25] with the water just like the woman that
[1:19:27] washed jesus's feet
[1:19:30] she she was no doubt not welcome in a
[1:19:32] lot of places
[1:19:34] but yet she was beautiful you know
[1:19:37] beauty
[1:19:37] beauty can be a curse
[1:19:40] it can be a curse but it can be a great
[1:19:42] thing
[1:19:44] amen beauty fades ugly lives on and on
[1:19:54] when i think about this woman i think
[1:19:56] about god's bride
[1:20:02] in this world had a lot of demons that
[1:20:04] was in the first nature
[1:20:07] and i'd say all of you could could go
[1:20:09] back real quick in your mind some of the
[1:20:11] things that ruled your life
[1:20:14] because you either serve god or you
[1:20:15] serve the devil
[1:20:18] and so in your first marriage to your
[1:20:20] first nature there was a lot of things
[1:20:22] that controlled your life
[1:20:29] a lot of things controlled you and they
[1:20:32] controlled you and you thought that's
[1:20:33] who you were
[1:20:37] but then jesus came
[1:20:43] and you think of the greatest preacher
[1:20:45] that would ever live
[1:20:47] of all of humanity's numbers
[1:20:52] he's going to meet a woman we all know
[1:20:55] the names peter james john
[1:20:58] bartholomew all of the the men disciples
[1:21:02] and what they're going to do and the
[1:21:03] purpose that they're going to have
[1:21:05] but this woman god's going to
[1:21:08] specifically use
[1:21:09] with purpose and when he finds her
[1:21:14] she's got seven devils that is
[1:21:17] controlling her life
[1:21:19] but jesus knows there's a gene seed of
[1:21:22] life
[1:21:22] that's laying on the inside of her and
[1:21:25] all of that other stuff
[1:21:27] is not hurt
[1:21:30] all of that other stuff that you were
[1:21:32] contaminated with that wasn't you
[1:21:36] but you came from god and you came
[1:21:39] through that
[1:21:39] that sexual birth and a lot of demons
[1:21:43] attracted itself to your flesh
[1:21:46] and god in your spirit
[1:21:49] and jesus turns it around to nicodemus
[1:21:52] the most religious man and said
[1:21:53] you must be born again
[1:21:56] [Applause]
[1:21:57] are you with me born again is dying to
[1:22:01] that first
[1:22:02] nature of course we know the real
[1:22:05] prescription is repent
[1:22:06] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:22:10] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:22:12] for the remission of your sins
[1:22:15] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:22:17] holy ghost
[1:22:19] for this promises and to you and to your
[1:22:21] children
[1:22:22] as many as afar off
[1:22:27] you're not even the same man you used to
[1:22:29] be
[1:22:31] how long does it take for this woman
[1:22:35] when she met jesus she was different
[1:22:38] in the very moment
[1:22:43] in the very moment
[1:22:47] because god's greater than every devil
[1:22:50] in hell
[1:22:55] and as i was sitting in my office this
[1:22:58] morning
[1:22:59] and i was looking at these notes and i
[1:23:02] said i want to remind you
[1:23:04] satan that god's greater
[1:23:07] than the strongest cancer devil
[1:23:11] in all of hell
[1:23:24] i want to just take you just for just a
[1:23:26] bit
[1:23:29] because mary magdalene is seen many
[1:23:31] times in the scriptures
[1:23:33] with jesus
[1:23:36] peter is there and he's been a fisherman
[1:23:41] when god found him he was he was in a
[1:23:44] quite bad situation
[1:23:48] there's a doctor there's a tax collector
[1:23:56] even a lawyer
[1:23:59] he found them all and he said follow me
[1:24:07] but here is 12 disciples
[1:24:10] and a woman
[1:24:14] brother jim if you can imagine seeing
[1:24:16] jesus in his congregation
[1:24:21] you know those guys they can put a robe
[1:24:24] on
[1:24:25] they're not naked no more
[1:24:28] they're away from their family and
[1:24:30] they're following jesus
[1:24:33] but here's a woman following him
[1:24:36] this woman has been one of the filthiest
[1:24:40] human beings to ever live
[1:24:46] i don't know if i can say it just right
[1:24:48] but she's been the
[1:24:50] gutter she's been the armpit of society
[1:24:55] but jesus is going to use her as a
[1:24:58] testimony of the redemption power
[1:25:02] of almighty god
[1:25:12] can i say it can i say it like it needs
[1:25:15] to be said
[1:25:17] you as sisters are not a second
[1:25:20] class
[1:25:24] there should be shouting in the room you
[1:25:26] are not a
[1:25:27] lower grade of society you
[1:25:31] are a reflection of the queen of heaven
[1:25:44] are you with me it's because of stupid
[1:25:47] men
[1:25:52] and perverted preachers that have tried
[1:25:56] to place
[1:25:57] women in a second class and push her
[1:26:00] down
[1:26:01] but let me just say this to you a woman
[1:26:04] in her right
[1:26:05] spot reflects the glory of heaven
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:16] [Music]
[1:26:20] hallelujah
[1:26:24] she can show purity she can show
[1:26:29] character she can show passion
[1:26:33] she can show humility
[1:26:36] brother ron but women can't preach don't
[1:26:39] tell me that
[1:26:42] our sisters preach sermons and krogers
[1:26:44] in
[1:26:45] walmart in the bank in this
[1:26:48] church they preach thousands of sermons
[1:26:52] a day
[1:26:53] by their dress by their conduct
[1:26:56] by the way they do business
[1:27:16] hallelujah
[1:27:21] don't get resentful with brothers with
[1:27:23] me on that deal

[1:27:27] married your wife
[1:27:32] that's what brother brown said in
[1:27:33] choosing of a bride
[1:27:35] he said you showed the real inside of
[1:27:37] you
[1:27:44] i don't mind saying it where'd she go
[1:27:56] i like to have sister connie on my arm

[1:29:00] i'll build her up
[1:29:01] she'll get big headed
[1:29:05] [Applause]
[1:29:08] valentine's day is not the only day to
[1:29:10] tell your wife how beautiful she is
[1:29:14] and how much that you love her i'm
[1:29:16] preaching now
[1:29:17] i'm preaching right to you
[1:29:20] it's not the only day to get a card and
[1:29:23] say i love you
[1:29:24] honey i love you more it should be a
[1:29:26] daily event
[1:29:28] of a love affair between you and your
[1:29:31] wife
[1:29:35] brother ron you're just talking about
[1:29:36] natural no i'm talking about your
[1:29:38] husband to jesus
[1:29:40] [Applause]
[1:29:41] you need to spend some time every day
[1:29:43] telling him
[1:29:44] how much you love him how much you care
[1:29:46] for him
[1:29:47] how glad you are to serve in this
[1:29:49] kingdom
[1:29:51] thank you for your grace thank you for
[1:29:53] your mercy

[1:29:58] thank you for preserving me
[1:30:00] i was worthy of hell thank you
[1:30:08] [Applause]
[1:30:18] uh
[1:30:23] jesus instructed mary magdalene
[1:30:28] to prepare precious ointments
[1:30:32] he don't just call you for you to sit in
[1:30:36] a service
[1:30:37] he's got a job for you to do
[1:30:45] she was more than the woman delivered of
[1:30:47] seven demons
[1:30:50] mary magdalene is going to be one of the
[1:30:53] re
[1:30:54] greatest representatives of jesus christ
[1:31:04] he needs somebody to come
[1:31:08] and tell the resurrection
[1:31:13] and of all of his congregation
[1:31:17] he picks her
[1:31:23] i want you to think about this just real
[1:31:24] quickly
[1:31:26] paul the world he picked you
[1:31:35] that's mind-boggling that's rainbow
[1:31:50] to the world i'm a nobody but to god i'm
[1:31:53] somebody
[1:31:56] and you say that to yourself just real
[1:31:57] quickly loud enough that you can hear
[1:31:59] yourself
[1:32:00] to the world i'm a nobody but to god
[1:32:05] i'm a symbol
[1:32:10] now we've got 2 000 years of history
[1:32:15] between us and then but there was a lot
[1:32:18] of pressure
[1:32:20] for her to visit the tomb
[1:32:25] of all of the people with mary her
[1:32:28] mother
[1:32:29] and joanna all of the people that were
[1:32:32] selected
[1:32:34] to come to the tomb guards there
[1:32:37] they're still gambling people are still
[1:32:41] under greater of great things listen
[1:32:44] even the pressure on the soldiers
[1:32:48] once they find out the body's missing
[1:32:51] they come up with a story
[1:32:53] and are told to tell the story
[1:32:58] if they could come back now that money
[1:33:00] that they were told to tell a lie about
[1:33:02] jesus is being stolen
[1:33:05] it's not worth a hill of beings
[1:33:10] are you with me the money that judas got
[1:33:15] to tell where jesus was at
[1:33:19] doesn't mean nothing but in history
[1:33:22] it will be the money that was given
[1:33:25] to tell where jesus was at i wonder how
[1:33:29] many
[1:33:30] brother branham said elvis presley sold
[1:33:32] out for a fleet of cadillacs and
[1:33:33] popularity that won't mean nothing in
[1:33:36] eternity
[1:33:38] that won't mean nothing in eternity
[1:33:42] somebody may be watching today and
[1:33:44] you're making choices in your life
[1:33:48] the wrong kind of mate won't mean
[1:33:50] nothing in eternity
[1:33:52] beauty won't mean nothing in eternity
[1:33:55] jobs that take you away from god
[1:33:57] won't mean nothing
[1:34:01] won't mean nothing you ever walk through
[1:34:04] a graveyard and you see
[1:34:05] dates on there maybe a little
[1:34:07] subscription a date
[1:34:08] they don't tell nothing about their
[1:34:10] story some of them is over 100 years old
[1:34:13] they live their life it's gone and only
[1:34:17] what they did for jesus will matter
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:22] it don't say that they owned the bank it
[1:34:24] don't say that they owned the story
[1:34:25] don't
[1:34:27] oh somebody help me preach right here
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:30] it don't say that they were a basketball
[1:34:32] star it won't say
[1:34:39] on the day of judgment having all the
[1:34:42] points in the world on the basketball
[1:34:44] or on some crazy video game won't mean
[1:34:48] nothing
[1:34:48] [Applause]
[1:34:51] it won't mean nothing
[1:35:10] a real believer
[1:35:13] she has watched isaiah 53 be fulfilled
[1:35:18] and i want to say to you all of us have
[1:35:20] had some real disappointments in life
[1:35:23] and some real discouragements but no
[1:35:26] doubt she watched them
[1:35:28] beat him
[1:35:31] until he was totally unreasonable
[1:35:36] and there was simply nothing
[1:35:39] she could do to stop it
[1:35:43] i wasn't standing there beside of her
[1:35:47] to tell her mary
[1:35:51] there's a reason this has got to happen
[1:35:56] he is fulfilled in isaiah 53
[1:36:00] so that i as a cancer victim
[1:36:03] can be
[1:36:11] and those men were anointed to beat him
[1:36:15] but she was standing there with her
[1:36:16] heart wide open watching
[1:36:19] her champion
[1:36:23] he was her champion
[1:36:26] and she was watching him being beat
[1:36:29] no doubt she stood in the crowd and she
[1:36:33] heard them people that she saw
[1:36:36] eat fish and eat bread and healed
[1:36:39] and miracles take place and she watched
[1:36:42] those
[1:36:42] families that only just a few days ago
[1:36:45] pulled down limbs and said hosanna to
[1:36:48] the king
[1:36:49] and it was a song of jubilation that
[1:36:52] took place
[1:36:53] the king is coming and here we are
[1:36:56] almost a week later and they're beating
[1:36:59] him
[1:37:00] like no other human being and
[1:37:03] now they're screaming crucify him
[1:37:11] no doubt she ran to him and said are you
[1:37:13] out of your mind
[1:37:14] are you insane and she was screaming his
[1:37:18] name but her scream
[1:37:21] amongst the thousands of people didn't
[1:37:23] mean nothing
[1:37:37] she watched him as he was now so
[1:37:40] war in his body
[1:37:45] until well now he couldn't carry his own
[1:37:48] cross
[1:37:54] they pushed him they beat him
[1:37:58] these hollywood movies couldn't touch
[1:38:00] how bad it really was
[1:38:03] they can't go to the realms of how
[1:38:05] vicious that calvary was
[1:38:08] and he did it for you
[1:38:15] that's what this week in history was
[1:38:18] because without him doing it
[1:38:20] you're lost i don't care what your last
[1:38:24] name is
[1:38:26] you're lost without being
[1:38:29] born again
[1:38:35] you're lost oh brother ron i want to
[1:38:38] make the rapture well you got to be born
[1:38:39] again

[1:41:22] and say they pull a man out of the crowd
[1:41:25] not even his own race
[1:41:28] but it's a god race
[1:41:33] actually his two sons will be in the new
[1:41:35] testament
[1:41:37] rufus would be one of them and they'd be
[1:41:40] real
[1:41:41] real men and simon
[1:41:45] steps out and steps up under the cross
[1:41:48] picks it up
[1:41:52] now jesus is with him
[1:41:55] i don't know what it would be like but
[1:41:57] if i could take simon's place just for a
[1:41:59] few moments
[1:42:03] i just say one step in front of the
[1:42:06] other

[1:42:20] watching his eyes roll from one place to
[1:42:23] another
[1:42:26] as they beat him and they mock him
[1:42:32] and the woman runs out in front of it

[1:43:27] for her for me
[1:43:31] for this rapture to happen he's got to

[1:48:43] who would be the first one to know that
[1:48:46] he was alive
[1:48:54] not a phd not a ddd
[1:48:59] not a great a woman
[1:49:04] that had been delivered of seven demons
[1:49:08] a woman that silently preached
[1:49:12] for about three years
[1:49:16] of the character of the power
[1:49:20] of redemption of christ
[1:49:25] she's the woman that will make her way
[1:49:28] to the tomb
[1:49:33] and she'll look in and see two angels
[1:49:43] she stands up and it's more than her
[1:49:45] heart can say

[1:49:52] are you seeking the living amongst the
[1:49:54] dead
