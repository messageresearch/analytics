[26:31] I believe that this morning
[26:35] as we read off these prayer requests

[29:52] there's more than two or three here this
[29:54] morning that's gathered here believing
[29:56] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[29:59] Amen. I'm going to ask Brother Gabriel
[30:00] if he would just come lead us to the
[30:02] throne of grace.
[30:05] [Music]
[30:12] How many enjoyed that service last
[30:14] night? Um, I just I'd like to say this
[30:17] and just, you know, we're blessed. We're
[30:19] very blessed to be able to have the
[30:20] ministry team that we have. Extremely
[30:23] blessed. And, you know, God's blessed me
[30:26] to be able to stand in some pretty
[30:28] pretty incredible places. And, you know,
[30:30] I've stood in a back room with President
[30:32] Trump. I've prayed in a in an office the
[30:35] size of the ministry office with with
[30:39] Governor Yncan. They're tremendous
[30:42] people. Politics or be politics. They
[30:45] trust in God. And I've been able to
[30:48] stand beside them and even Lieutenant
[30:50] Governor Sears stand beside her and and
[30:53] she still would wake up at 4:00 in the
[30:54] morning and have prayer with have prayer
[30:57] with her her believers in Winchester at
[30:59] 4:00 in the morning. and I've been able
[31:01] to stand beside them and have have just
[31:04] conversation with them and I would not
[31:06] trade a moment to sit in this seat to be
[31:09] a to have to stand with them. They're
[31:12] incredible people been able to stand in
[31:13] some incredible places and I'm
[31:15] privileged and I thank God for that. But
[31:18] don't become numb to the ministry that's
[31:20] here.
[31:22] If I can just tell you that do not
[31:24] become numb to the ministry that we have
[31:26] here. God sent God sent you a gift. Five
[31:30] gifts that sit up here every
[31:33] morning. Don't become numb to that. Come
[31:36] to every service expecting to hear
[31:38] something. Let's just take the needs
[31:40] these needs before the
[31:42] Lord. Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful
[31:45] to be able to come and be here this
[31:47] morning. And Lord Jesus, I just I just
[31:50] believe that we're in store for a
[31:51] miracle this morning. And maybe one of
[31:53] those miracles or many of those miracles
[31:55] that that we will see will walk in the
[31:57] baptism and you will see a son or
[32:00] daughter of God come back to their
[32:01] rightful place with you, Lord. And I
[32:03] believe that when when one comes and
[32:05] accepts their place and realizes that
[32:07] they're walking back into home and
[32:09] walking back into the place that you
[32:11] placed them before the foundation of the
[32:12] world, Lord Jesus, I believe that you
[32:15] will place a seed inside of their life
[32:17] and you will come and you will do
[32:18] exactly what you said you would do. And
[32:20] you would fill them with the Holy Ghost.
[32:21] And Lord Jesus, you hear each and every
[32:23] one of these needs that have been
[32:25] brought before us. And Lord Jesus, you
[32:27] you are the one that can come and heal
[32:29] these. And Lord Jesus, the prophet would
[32:31] come and tell us that you would place us
[32:33] in your hand and in your right hand and
[32:35] that would give us the authority to be
[32:36] able to go and lay hands on the sick and
[32:39] pray for those who are sick and give
[32:41] prayer clause as brother brother William
[32:43] would say last night. And Lord Jesus,
[32:45] allow us not to just look at those
[32:47] things as another as another ritual or a
[32:50] thing we do. Allow us to be able to see
[32:52] that that is nothing but ordained of God
[32:54] to be able to be an extension of your
[32:56] hand, Lord. And I just pray that if we
[32:58] could just take an image of of your nail
[33:00] scarred hands as you would be upon the
[33:02] cross. Lord Jesus, you did that for each
[33:04] and every one of us. And Lord, where
[33:06] would we be if you wouldn't come and
[33:07] call us out of the the wicked and evil
[33:09] places that we would be? I I think of I
[33:11] think of brother Levi there that they
[33:13] would just they would bring prayer for
[33:15] Lord. You see where he is at. And Lord
[33:17] Jesus, what what battles may come even
[33:19] with his family, but Lord Jesus, I pray
[33:21] that you would go right to where he's at
[33:22] right now and you can be his deliverer,
[33:24] Lord. and all the prayer requests that
[33:26] have been unspoken and even the ones who
[33:28] are spoken. You know where they are at.
[33:30] You know their names and you know every
[33:31] situation that they may go through. Lord
[33:33] Jesus, brother Andrew as he would come,
[33:36] Lord Jesus, I know that we are going to
[33:38] I just believe and know that we can see
[33:40] a miracle this morning because you were
[33:41] here. What atmosphere we have Lord and
[33:44] we just thank you in Jesus name we pray.
[33:50] Amen. Amen. At this time, we'll receive
[33:53] this morning's offering. You give as
[33:55] God's blessed you. I have Sister Amanda
[33:57] Meadows come sing for us this morning.
[33:59] Then we'll have Sister uh Julia sing for
[34:02] us. As she's making her way, I'd like to
[34:04] make some uh announcements
[34:06] here. Want to be remembering that uh
[34:09] next weekend we're going to have Brother
[34:11] Aaron Ogles be here with us. So, we
[34:13] thank the Lord for that and praying for
[34:15] him and his family. Safe travels there.
[34:18] We certainly love our brother Aaron and
[34:20] his ministry.
[34:22] And I just want to pray for them that
[34:24] God would just uh use him in a
[34:25] supernatural way. And then also um we'd
[34:30] like to start setting aside time every
[34:34] couple weeks to practice special songs
[34:37] with anyone in the church who would have
[34:40] a special. These practices will be held
[34:43] here at the church. We ask those
[34:45] interested in singing or playing a
[34:48] special to reach out to myself and
[34:51] Sister Cassie. I will have a uh if you
[34:54] would just reach out to both of us. That
[34:57] way uh ladies aren't contacting me or
[34:59] gentlemen contacting Sister Cassie. So
[35:02] if you could just reach out to each of
[35:04] us and uh we will be scheduling those
[35:06] times and setting up times where we can
[35:09] have our musicians here and then we can
[35:12] do that. We would like to try to set
[35:14] aside time and have about six six of
[35:17] those specials
[35:18] uh at a time set up and ready to go. So,
[35:21] if you have one, you have something on
[35:23] your heart you'd like to sing, we'd like
[35:25] to set aside time. So, just reach out to
[35:27] me and uh we'd like to get that uh set
[35:30] up. So, that way I'm not having to call
[35:34] around on Saturday and Sunday and find
[35:37] people that want to sing for us. want to
[35:40] have people that want to worship,
[35:42] worship the Lord. And uh this is not
[35:45] Hollywood, so it's not a show. So if
[35:48] God's laid something on your heart that
[35:51] you'd like to sing, you just contact me
[35:53] and we'll make a way for that. Amen. So
[35:56] God richly bless you. Thank you. You can
[35:58] be seated after you've given this
[35:59] morning. Bless you, Sister Amanda.
[36:04] When my
[36:06] Lord walked to
[36:09] Calvary, there was no
[36:12] beauty in that
[36:15] scene. He was
[36:17] bruised and put to shame
[36:21] there as the
[36:24] crowd did cheer and
[36:30] scream. It wasn't his fault.
[36:34] For things he
[36:36] done, but for my sins he stood
[36:42] condemned. Now how could
[36:45] I be
[36:48] ashamed of him?
[36:54] [Music]
[36:55] How could
[36:57] I be
[37:01] ashamed of that
[37:03] side dripping with
[37:07] blood? How could
[37:10] I be
[37:11] [Music]
[37:13] ashamed of that markedy
[37:16] crown that he wore?
[37:23] Though he
[37:25] had every
[37:28] reason to
[37:31] be ashamed of
[37:34] me. I could
[37:37] never be
[37:40] ashamed of him.
[37:44] [Music]
[37:47] Now he's the same
[37:50] Lord
[37:52] today with his
[37:55] nailed pierced
[37:58] feet. And there's no
[38:01] beauty that this all war
[38:05] desires. And his holy word they won't
[38:13] keep. God, I'll take
[38:17] him and the scorn out there till my
[38:23] journey is
[38:25] complete. No, I could
[38:29] never be
[38:32] ashamed of
[38:35] [Music]
[38:38] him. How could
[38:41] I be ashamed?
[38:45] of that
[38:47] side dripping with blood.
[38:51] How could
[38:53] I be
[38:56] ashamed of that mighty
[39:00] crown that he
[39:05] wore that he
[39:08] had every
[39:10] [Music]
[39:11] reason to
[39:14] be ashamed of me?
[39:18] So I could
[39:20] never be
[39:23] ashamed of
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] him. No, I could
[39:32] never be
[39:36] ashamed of him.
[39:45] [Applause]
[40:08] [Music]
[40:24] I've been
[40:26] there in the lowest of
[40:32] times. I've had questions in my mind.
[40:37] I've been scared.
[40:41] But I
[40:44] know that I have a
[40:49] Savior who knows right where I am and
[40:54] hears my
[40:58] prayers. In the midst of all the
[41:02] problems and burdens of this
[41:06] life, I will call upon the one who can
[41:12] get me through the
[41:16] night. Lord, hold my
[41:19] hand in the middle of my
[41:24] storm when I'm sinking down.
[41:28] now. Lord, help me to
[41:32] stand when the waves are crashing
[41:37] around. May I keep my eyes on
[41:41] you. Cuz Lord, you're the only one who
[41:46] can help me get
[41:50] through the middle of my struggle.
[41:55] [Music]
[42:09] I don't
[42:11] know how the story will
[42:16] end. I didn't see this in the plans you
[42:22] had for me.
[42:26] But I
[42:29] know that I can
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] trust in the one who's working all
[42:38] things for my good.
[42:43] Though I may not know the
[42:47] answers till I reach the other
[42:51] side, I will keep my eyes on
[42:55] Jesus. Till my faith become
[43:00] sight. Lord, hold my
[43:04] hand in the middle of my
[43:07] [Music]
[43:08] storm when I'm sinking down.
[43:13] Lord, help me to
[43:16] stand when the waves are crashing
[43:20] around. May I keep my eyes on
[43:25] you. Cuz Lord, you're the only one who
[43:30] can help me get
[43:33] through the middle of my stor.
[43:39] [Music]
[43:40] Lord, you're greater than my
[43:44] problems, greater than my
[43:48] fears. You are greater than my
[43:53] weakness, greater than my
[43:56] tears. And you have
[43:59] never let me
[44:04] down. And you are here with me right
[44:13] [Music]
[44:16] now. Lord, hold my
[44:20] hand in the middle of my storm.
[44:26] When I'm sinking
[44:29] down, help me to
[44:32] stand. When the waves are crashing
[44:37] around, may I keep my eyes on
[44:41] you. Cuz Lord, you're the only one who
[44:47] can help me get through.
[44:50] [Music]
[44:52] You are the only one who can help me get
[44:58] through the middle of my storm.
[45:03] [Music]
[45:22] [Applause]
[45:28] Amen. We know he's our peace in our
[45:30] storm.
[45:32] Let us stand at this time. Let's sing
[45:34] it. That I could still go free. I can
[45:37] still go free.
[45:41] You can
[45:43] lock me
[45:46] up in a prison.
[45:50] [Music]
[45:53] Oh, and throw
[45:56] the
[45:58] [Music]
[46:05] o won't
[46:08] take
[46:11] away my vision.
[46:17] Oh, from these
[46:21] eyes that
[46:23] night now
[46:26] [Music]
[46:29] see open to
[46:33] cry
[46:36] me the food
[46:44] and
[46:45] [Music]
[46:49] he my
[46:51] hands and my
[46:55] feet hold as
[46:58] long and as
[47:01] I I know
[47:03] [Music]
[47:06] Jesus he said that
[47:11] I could
[47:14] still
[47:18] brea. He said that
[47:22] I I could
[47:25] still go free.
[47:32] Oh, tell me what
[47:34] kind of
[47:38] man would reach
[47:41] [Music]
[47:44] down into this glory.
[47:48] [Music]
[47:56] worthy to
[47:59] live for when I
[48:02] [Music]
[48:04] feel. Oh yeah, the man
[48:08] on the cross.
[48:11] He puts me
[48:14] in his
[48:16] will and said that
[48:20] I I could
[48:22] [Music]
[48:23] still
[48:26] [Music]
[48:32] free
[48:35] her quite
[48:37] [Music]
[48:41] understand why a
[48:45] king would
[48:48] be
[48:49] [Music]
[48:57] his growing
[49:02] [Music]
[49:12] painful flesh
[49:15] [Music]
[49:18] and open to
[49:22] me your
[49:25] Oh my
[49:27] [Music]
[49:34] ly to
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:40] [Music]
[49:42] cal where the
[49:46] [Music]
[49:49] blood they
[49:53] all my
[49:54] change in
[49:58] s I could
[50:01] still go
[50:04] [Music]
[50:06] free. Oh, he said that
[50:10] I I could
[50:12] still
[50:14] [Music]
[50:25] go reach
[50:27] down his
[50:31] hand and do this for
[50:40] Oh,
[50:43] unworthy to
[50:46] give and not
[50:49] fail to
[50:51] kill the little man
[50:54] on the cross.
[50:58] He put my name
[51:01] in his
[51:03] will and said that
[51:07] I I can
[51:11] still free.
[51:15] And you're thankful for that man. Amen.
[51:18] Amen. Let's just go to the Lord in
[51:20] prayer just now. Heavenly Father, we
[51:23] come before you, Lord Jesus.
[51:25] Lord, we realize, Father, the the
[51:29] sacredness of the moment that we're
[51:31] standing in here, Lord Jesus. And we
[51:34] ask, Lord, that thou wouldest come,
[51:35] Lord, and minister unto us, Lord, by the
[51:38] by thy word, Father. God, we heard such
[51:42] a powerful word last night that even in
[51:45] the midst of our trial, Lord, we can
[51:48] have perfect faith and don't even
[51:50] realize it sometimes, but we're just
[51:51] stepping in, Lord, to the manifestations
[51:54] of sons of God. And I pray, Father,
[51:57] today that you would just quicken your
[52:00] word to our lives. Lord, I pray that you
[52:03] would minister to the lost. I pray that
[52:05] you'd minister to the bound. I pray that
[52:07] you'd minister to the little children
[52:09] and our seniors. Father, we ask that
[52:11] thou would just minister to them. Lord,
[52:14] thou knowest all things. And I pray,
[52:16] God, that this word that has been
[52:19] stirred in my heart that you would just
[52:21] allow me to step
[52:23] aside and Lord to bring forth the very
[52:26] heart of the father this morning. Lord,
[52:29] I humble myself as your servant in your
[52:32] hands. And Lord, I I have no abilities,
[52:35] no gifts really on my own except to get
[52:37] out of the way. And Lord, I pray that
[52:40] thou would bring your word to your
[52:42] believer's heart and it would minister
[52:44] to them. Lord, we while Peter yet spoke
[52:48] the words, the Holy Ghost fell. And
[52:50] Father, I believe that while the word
[52:52] can fall in this place, Lord Jesus, that
[52:56] the Holy Ghost can minister, Father, in
[52:59] a very special way. We love you so much,
[53:02] Lord Jesus. We give you this day in
[53:05] Jesus name. Amen. And amen. If you have
[53:08] your Bibles, we like to look in book of
[53:11] Matthew chapter 25.
[53:30] Matthew chapter 25 and verse
[53:37] 14.
[53:40] Amen. Say amen when you have it
[53:44] today. For the kingdom of heaven is as a
[53:47] man traveling into a far
[53:49] country, who called his own servants,
[53:52] and delivered unto them his goods. And
[53:55] unto one he gave five talents, and to
[53:57] another two, and another one. To every
[54:01] man according to his several ability,
[54:03] and straightway he took his journey.
[54:05] Then he that had received the five
[54:07] talents went and traded with them the
[54:09] same, and made them other five talents.
[54:12] And likewise, he that had received two,
[54:15] he also gained other two. But he that
[54:18] received one went and digged in the
[54:21] earth, and hid his Lord's money. And
[54:24] after a long time, the Lord of those
[54:25] servants cometh and reckonth with them.
[54:28] And so he that had received five talents
[54:30] came and brought other five talents,
[54:32] saying, Lord, thou deliverest unto me
[54:34] five talents. Behold, I have gained
[54:37] thee, gained beside them five talents
[54:40] more. And his lord said unto him, Well
[54:43] done, thou good and faithful servant.
[54:45] Thou has been faithful over a few
[54:47] things. I will make thee ruler over many
[54:50] things. Enter thou into the joy of the
[54:52] Lord. He also that had received two
[54:55] talents came and said, Lord, thou
[54:57] deliverest unto me two talents. Behold,
[54:59] I have gained two other talents beside
[55:01] them. His lord said unto him, Well done,
[55:04] good and faithful servant. Thou hast
[55:07] been faithful over a few things. I will
[55:09] make thee ruler over many things. Enter
[55:11] thou into the joy of the Lord. Then he
[55:14] which had received the one talent came
[55:17] and said, 'Lord, I knew that thou art an
[55:19] hard man, reaping where thou hast not
[55:22] sown, and gathering where thou hast not
[55:24] strawled. And I was afraid, and went hid
[55:26] thy talent in the earth, and lo, thou
[55:30] there, thou hast that is thine. His lord
[55:34] answered and said unto him, Thou wicked
[55:36] and slothful servant. Thou knowest that
[55:38] I reap where I sowed not, and gather
[55:42] where I have not straled. Thou oughtest
[55:44] therefore to have put my money to the
[55:47] exchangers, and that at my coming I
[55:48] should have received my own usery with
[55:52] usery. Take therefore the talent from
[55:54] him, and give it unto him which hath 10
[55:57] talents. For unto everyone that hath
[56:00] shall be given, and he shall have
[56:02] abundance, but from them but from him
[56:05] that hath not shall be taken away, even
[56:08] that which he hath, and cast ye the
[56:11] unprofitable
[56:13] servant into the outer darkness there
[56:16] shall be weeping and nashing of teeth.
[56:19] Also, Matthew or I'm sorry, Psalms
[56:22] chapter 69 and verse 9. Just one little
[56:25] scripture here.
[56:27] For the zeal of thine house hath eaten
[56:30] me up, and the reproaches of them that
[56:34] reproach thee are fallen upon me. May
[56:37] God bless his word. You may be seated
[56:39] today in the presence of the Lord. I'd
[56:41] like to just speak a little thought that
[56:43] the Lord I was driving back from
[56:45] Kentucky there a couple weeks ago and
[56:48] the Lord just began to deal with me on
[56:50] this on this subject from these
[56:53] scriptures. I would like to speak to you
[56:54] on well
[56:56] done. Well done. And we realize that
[57:00] that we're living in a very pivotable
[57:02] moment in time. And we realize that
[57:04] throughout the course of time that men
[57:05] have accomplished many great feats
[57:08] throughout their throughout their time
[57:10] in history, throughout their efforts and
[57:13] inventions of of different things that
[57:15] have shaped the world that you and I
[57:17] live in today. And I say thank God for
[57:19] these modern these modern inventions.
[57:21] And we thank that. And you begin to look
[57:23] in the 1800s about the things that were
[57:26] invented that would begin to trans uh
[57:29] that would literally they would
[57:30] completely transform the world that we
[57:32] live in. You would look at the steam
[57:34] engine and you would see that the men
[57:36] that created it and you didn't realize
[57:38] what they were doing at that time, but
[57:40] it literally fueled an an industrial
[57:42] revolution and modern transportation
[57:45] begin to take off. And in that era, you
[57:47] would begin to watch things like the
[57:49] telegraph and the light bulb and a and
[57:51] and the telephone. And then you begin to
[57:54] watch, you begin to watch as it moves
[57:56] into the 1900s and you begin to see that
[57:58] men begin to get under the anointing and
[58:01] they begin to move and they would create
[58:03] there. We would create one of the
[58:05] greatest things that we have as
[58:07] humanity. We would see the airplane that
[58:09] is created and it refili it
[58:11] revolutionalized not only just travel
[58:13] but global travel. And I would say well
[58:17] done because I sure didn't want to I
[58:19] sure didn't want to ride a boat to New
[58:21] Zealand about a month ago. I so
[58:24] appreciate and I say well done on
[58:25] creating those things. Wilbur Wilbur and
[58:27] them I sure appreciate them spending
[58:29] some times and getting hurt and they
[58:31] didn't realize throughout all their
[58:33] journeys from moving to Ohio down to
[58:34] North Carolina to catch a win. They
[58:36] there was a lot of people that thought
[58:37] they were crazy. Yeah. Amen. There was a
[58:39] lot of people that said that they was
[58:41] insane, but because they had a they had
[58:44] something on the inside of them that was
[58:45] that was pushing them. You see, you see
[58:48] in that era of the 1900s, you begin to
[58:51] see computers as they begin to move into
[58:54] the digital realm and modern invention
[58:56] begin to come in. Internet begins to
[58:58] come in. Nuclear power, we begin to see
[59:00] it in the 20th century. And then we roll
[59:03] around into the 21st century and you
[59:05] begin to see smartphones in everybody's
[59:07] hands. They they begin to see social
[59:09] media. We begin to see that they begin
[59:12] to reshape culture completely by social
[59:15] media.
[59:17] And I say, I don't know about saying
[59:20] well done to that. You begin to see
[59:22] artificial intelligence as it completely
[59:25] transforms industries and and even human
[59:28] capability.
[59:30] And I'm not sure I can say well done to
[59:32] a lot of people that I say some of those
[59:34] things are for our good. And I I believe
[59:36] that I believe that God has a way of
[59:39] using things, but there's a lot of
[59:41] people that are
[59:42] becoming
[59:44] modern dummies
[59:49] because they they don't want to study. I
[59:51] I'll be honest, I sat just a few weeks
[59:53] ago at at Sister Riley's graduation and
[59:56] I I heard one of the worst worst
[59:59] speeches from a validictorian I've ever
[1:00:01] heard in my entire life.
[1:00:04] And I'm not saying anything about the
[1:00:05] girl, but I'm just simply saying that
[1:00:07] that is that is what we're producing in
[1:00:09] this era because that's the that's the
[1:00:12] kind of generation that we're raising
[1:00:14] that we're raising men not to know the
[1:00:17] power of the gospel. We have we have
[1:00:20] witnessed supernatural things in this
[1:00:22] era. And I'll just be honest, it
[1:00:24] literally scares me for the future. If
[1:00:27] God leaves us here 20 more years, who
[1:00:29] will be running this country? When mamas
[1:00:32] and daddies I I'm going to move on, but
[1:00:34] when mas and daddies when they do not
[1:00:36] know how to discipline their children
[1:00:38] and they do not know how to they do not
[1:00:40] know how to navigate them towards the
[1:00:42] word of the Lord. I say that it scares
[1:00:45] me to think that if God would leave us
[1:00:46] here, but you watch in those modern
[1:00:49] events that even even you begin to see
[1:00:52] the cloud raise up and you begin to see
[1:00:54] as men begin to download their their
[1:00:57] data that goes to a cloud and I can't
[1:00:59] tell you where it's at, but it's hanging
[1:01:00] up there in a cloud. And I literally
[1:01:02] just I literally just change changed all
[1:01:05] of my sermons from one platform to
[1:01:07] another platform because it wouldn't
[1:01:08] upload fast
[1:01:10] enough. Amen. It's the age of the cloud.
[1:01:14] But I realize this that we had a cloud
[1:01:16] standing this day. And I don't have to
[1:01:18] worry about the speed of that cloud. I
[1:01:20] don't have to worry about where it's
[1:01:21] taken me. But I'll say that that cloud
[1:01:24] came to produce some people that could
[1:01:26] God could say about them, well done.
[1:01:30] You think about you think about all of
[1:01:32] these events that have that have
[1:01:33] happened and you see these inventions
[1:01:35] that are taking place. You look in the
[1:01:37] 1400s. I'd say that when Gutenberg was
[1:01:40] creating the Gutenberg uh press, he
[1:01:42] didn't realize the value that was behind
[1:01:45] it. Sure, he had a purpose. Sure, he had
[1:01:46] a zeal, but there was something that was
[1:01:49] pushing him. And when you begin to see
[1:01:51] men like Tinddale and men like Luther,
[1:01:53] as they begin to gather the word of God,
[1:01:56] they begin to realize that men had to
[1:01:58] have this, that the Catholic Church
[1:02:00] couldn't have all to all of it to
[1:02:01] themselves, and they begin to work
[1:02:03] tirelessly. They begin to memorize
[1:02:06] scripture and they would take it back.
[1:02:07] They would write it down. They'd work
[1:02:09] throughout the night. What were they
[1:02:10] doing? They were striving for the
[1:02:12] master. They were literally striving for
[1:02:15] the master. And that word strive, it
[1:02:17] means to be to try very hard to do
[1:02:20] something or to make something happen,
[1:02:22] especially against all the difficulties.
[1:02:25] And I believe this that the word is
[1:02:28] going to it's going to go against the
[1:02:30] grain of humanity. It's going to go
[1:02:32] against the grain of of human
[1:02:34] capabilities. But Jesus said, strive to
[1:02:38] enter in at the straight gate. Paul
[1:02:40] said, Paul said in the letter of
[1:02:42] Colossians, "Whereto I also labor,
[1:02:45] striving according to his working, which
[1:02:48] workketh in me might mildly." You begin
[1:02:51] to think about Paul and all that he was
[1:02:53] under. How that how he came out out of
[1:02:56] the Sanhedrin movement, how he came out
[1:02:58] and he was he was under that he was
[1:03:00] under the influence of the church world
[1:03:02] of that day. And you watch as zeal
[1:03:06] begins to move on the inside of him. I
[1:03:08] want to go further. It wasn't just zeal,
[1:03:10] but it was an anointing that came upon
[1:03:12] Paul that literally changed his name
[1:03:15] from Saul to Paul. And Paul began to
[1:03:18] realize that the zeal that he had didn't
[1:03:21] come from himself. But this zeal came
[1:03:24] from the mind of God.
[1:03:28] You think about you think about Paul and
[1:03:31] all that he was under and all the
[1:03:33] pressure that he was under
[1:03:36] tied to a Roman jailer. But he had
[1:03:39] something on the inside of him that he
[1:03:41] was going to run his race. He was going
[1:03:43] to do everything within his power. He
[1:03:45] stood there and he watched those men as
[1:03:48] they were in the arenas as they would
[1:03:50] stand there and they would build their
[1:03:52] techniques and their talents and their
[1:03:53] abilities to be better warriors in their
[1:03:56] field. And Paul stood there and told us
[1:03:59] to be be strong like a soldier. He told
[1:04:02] us to finish our course. He said to run
[1:04:05] this race.
[1:04:07] You think about the men of the ages and
[1:04:09] I I think about there's so many that we
[1:04:12] could name, but I think about William
[1:04:15] Brandon that ran with everything that
[1:04:18] was within him. Though he had trial
[1:04:21] after trial after task after task, he
[1:04:24] still never gave up on his purpose. He
[1:04:27] had a zeal to bring this message and to
[1:04:30] drop a seed to its designated spot. You
[1:04:34] see men that would raise up under their
[1:04:36] messenger and would be a final voice to
[1:04:39] the final generation. Men like Ed
[1:04:41] Biscll, men like Harold Hilderbrandt,
[1:04:45] men like Roy Shrewberry, more like Homer
[1:04:47] Fraser and Charlie Spencer. And the
[1:04:49] names go on, but they ran their race.
[1:04:52] They gave their lives. What was it for?
[1:04:55] They were filled with a zeal to make
[1:04:58] sure that this seed gets to its
[1:05:00] destination. I'd say like the prophet
[1:05:03] said, they were perseverant. They had
[1:05:06] made up in their mind that there was a
[1:05:08] goal ahead of them and they were going
[1:05:10] to see that they achieve that goal.
[1:05:13] Now the prophet said in Jehovah Gyra, he
[1:05:16] said, "Now what influence I have, I try
[1:05:19] to use it to honor Christ and to bring
[1:05:22] sinners to repentance. It's all that I
[1:05:24] know to do." Hoping at that day and
[1:05:27] trusting that he will say, "It was well
[1:05:29] done." And that's the words I want to
[1:05:31] hear him say. He said, 'Ive often
[1:05:34] wondered, I'd like to heard him say when
[1:05:36] he stood there and stretched his arms
[1:05:37] that day and said, "Come unto me all ye
[1:05:40] that are heavy lad and labor and heavy
[1:05:42] laden." He said, "Now that was past, but
[1:05:45] well down, well done, my good and
[1:05:47] faithful servant will be in the future,
[1:05:50] and I'm living to hear that said
[1:05:55] again in testimony." He said, "May we
[1:05:58] shape our lives by self-control that
[1:06:02] we'll know by the help of the Holy
[1:06:04] Spirit to have full confidence that
[1:06:06] Jesus will say, "Well done, my good and
[1:06:09] faithful servant at that day in the
[1:06:12] thigh and church age." He said, now he
[1:06:15] picks up the scripture said, "I know
[1:06:16] your service." Jesus said that he that
[1:06:19] is greatest of all is servant to all. A
[1:06:22] wise man commented on that saying and
[1:06:25] here is what he said. Only history will
[1:06:28] prove the truth of that dictim. That man
[1:06:31] was right. All the truly great men of
[1:06:33] history have been servants. They who
[1:06:35] demanded to be served. Though they who
[1:06:38] oppress, they who oppressed and though
[1:06:40] they who sought to always be at the head
[1:06:43] have gone down in shame. Even the very
[1:06:46] rich are condemned by God when they have
[1:06:48] not used their wealth. But look into
[1:06:51] history and you will find that they that
[1:06:54] truly the great were those who served
[1:06:57] others.
[1:06:59] History can never acclaim to those for
[1:07:02] whom much was done. But it will forever
[1:07:04] praise those who did much for others.
[1:07:08] Now let us apply that to ourselves. Even
[1:07:10] the son of man as a son of man came to
[1:07:13] be ministered unto but to minister. So
[1:07:16] we are to follow that example. see him
[1:07:19] as he bows himself over the feet of the
[1:07:22] apostles and washes their tired feet,
[1:07:24] dirty feet. He he he said, "You don't
[1:07:28] know now what I'm doing, but you will
[1:07:31] know hereafter, but what you see me
[1:07:34] doing, you ought to also do." He became
[1:07:37] a servant in order that God could
[1:07:39] elevate him to the highest of heights.
[1:07:43] He became a servant so that God could
[1:07:46] elevate him to the highest of heights.
[1:07:49] And if we are ever going to be elevated,
[1:07:52] we've got to become and have the heart
[1:07:54] of a servant. And one day in the
[1:07:57] judgment of the saints, we are going to
[1:07:59] hear him say, "Well done, good and
[1:08:02] faithful servant. Enter thou into the
[1:08:04] joys of the Lord."
[1:08:06] He said, "It's hard to be always a
[1:08:08] servant, but those who spend are and are
[1:08:11] spent for others will one day be seated
[1:08:15] with him in his throne and it'll be
[1:08:17] worth it all then." You ever you ever
[1:08:20] done something and and it seems like you
[1:08:22] never got anything or nobody nobody ever
[1:08:24] thanked you for it?
[1:08:27] You ever done something in life and
[1:08:28] spent your energies and it looks like
[1:08:30] you were overlooked? I want you to know
[1:08:33] this that you weren't. Amen.
[1:08:35] That serving is like serving is like
[1:08:38] going up a river on a on a on a foggy
[1:08:40] river and it seemed like it might be
[1:08:43] going upstream and it seems like it's
[1:08:45] pointless that you're just going through
[1:08:47] the motions and and you keep digging in
[1:08:49] with your oars and you're digging in and
[1:08:51] it's a struggle the constant time
[1:08:53] because you can't see where you're
[1:08:55] going. You can't see to the left and you
[1:08:57] can't see to the right because the fog
[1:08:59] is so thick. But there's a voice at the
[1:09:02] back of the boat that is guiding you
[1:09:04] through the fog. He's guiding you there
[1:09:07] because the master of the ship has
[1:09:09] already chartered this river. He's been
[1:09:11] down this river before. He knows what
[1:09:14] the way to take. Like Job said, he knows
[1:09:17] the way that I take. And when he brings
[1:09:20] me forth, I will come forth like pure
[1:09:23] gold. You may not understand the way
[1:09:25] that you're taking right now. You may
[1:09:27] not understand the way that you're
[1:09:29] serving right now. But if you'll keep
[1:09:31] listening to the voice at the back of
[1:09:34] the boat that is guiding you silently
[1:09:38] in the unseen, it'll lead you to your
[1:09:40] destination.
[1:09:43] And we realize that that's the kind of
[1:09:45] battle that you and I are in right now.
[1:09:48] That we are facing an uphill
[1:09:50] battle. There is nothing about Leoa that
[1:09:53] is easy. There is nothing about Leoa
[1:09:57] that that that just seems to just make
[1:10:00] life easier except for modern
[1:10:04] inventions. But we realize that the
[1:10:07] spirit that we are facing of this age is
[1:10:09] to make us lukewarm and comfortable to
[1:10:11] the events that are going on around us.
[1:10:14] We clearly see that these are modern
[1:10:16] events that are being made clear by
[1:10:17] prophecy because we had an eagle eye
[1:10:20] begin to tell us about these things. But
[1:10:22] you watch how that Satan comes in there
[1:10:24] and he tries to make you lukewarm and he
[1:10:27] tries to make you comfortable to the
[1:10:29] scenes that you are seeing of men
[1:10:31] dressing up like
[1:10:33] men. Very very few do you see like that
[1:10:37] anymore. He tries to make you
[1:10:39] comfortable with men dressing up like
[1:10:42] women and women dressing up like men. I
[1:10:45] tell you one thing, I can't even I can't
[1:10:47] even let my wife go into places anymore.
[1:10:50] Not only do men hit on her, but last
[1:10:51] night women was hitting on her. My
[1:10:54] goodness. And it wasn't here at church,
[1:10:55] thank God. But thank God, Sister Brenda
[1:10:58] was there to back her
[1:11:00] up. But literally, Leoa wants to make us
[1:11:04] comfortable
[1:11:05] with sin.
[1:11:07] You realize that if you're ever going to
[1:11:09] build a boil a
[1:11:12] frog that you can't just turn up the
[1:11:14] heat all of a
[1:11:15] sudden. You've got to you've got to
[1:11:18] stick it in there. If you put that frog
[1:11:20] in that bowl and water, he's going to
[1:11:21] jump right out of there. But how you
[1:11:23] bowl a frog is you put him in there in
[1:11:25] water that he's comfortable with, that
[1:11:28] he's comfortable with, and then you
[1:11:30] slowly begin to raise the temperature,
[1:11:33] and make him get comfortable in the
[1:11:35] atmospheres that he's living in. You
[1:11:38] see, you've got to fight to live in this
[1:11:41] era that you're living in. We are facing
[1:11:43] every demon spirit to make us
[1:11:46] comfortable.
[1:11:47] But you know that whatever you yield to
[1:11:50] the Lord, that is what God can use. You
[1:11:53] see, Daniel yielded his prayer life to
[1:11:56] the Lord and God used his prayer life.
[1:11:59] David yielded his sling to the Lord and
[1:12:02] God used his sling. Moses yielded that
[1:12:05] rod and God used the rod.
[1:12:09] You see, whatever you yield to the Lord,
[1:12:11] God will use it. Brother man said,
[1:12:13] "Grace is what God did for me, but works
[1:12:16] is what I do for God." He said, 'Now,
[1:12:18] they'll make a doctrine out of it. They
[1:12:20] think that works is what wins your
[1:12:22] marriage. If it is, it isn't a free
[1:12:25] gift, but grace is what God did for you.
[1:12:28] By grace, you are saved. It's not by you
[1:12:32] working. And works is what you do in
[1:12:36] appreciation of the grace that he showed
[1:12:39] to you if you love him.
[1:12:42] You want to do you like to do the works
[1:12:45] of the Lord. Now Paul said in Colossians
[1:12:48] 3 and23 that whatsoever you do do it
[1:12:51] heartily as to the Lord and not unto men
[1:12:55] knowing that of the Lord that you shall
[1:12:57] receive the reward of the inheritance.
[1:13:00] For ye serve the Lord Jesus. That is
[1:13:04] where it matters at. It's who you're
[1:13:06] serving and why you're serving it. Why?
[1:13:09] What is your objective in serving the
[1:13:12] Lord? What is your objective in coming
[1:13:14] to the house of God? What is your
[1:13:16] objective in listening to the message?
[1:13:19] That whatever you do, do it heartily
[1:13:22] unto the Lord. You know that that is a
[1:13:24] spirit that's a spirit of a good and
[1:13:27] faithful servant. It's not about title.
[1:13:30] It's not about talent. And it's not
[1:13:32] about the size of the job that you're
[1:13:34] that you're doing, but it's simply about
[1:13:37] doing your task. It's about doing your
[1:13:39] part in God's plan with all of your
[1:13:42] heart. Not everybody's going to preach.
[1:13:45] Not everybody's going to sing. There's
[1:13:47] going to be some that pray in silent and
[1:13:49] then some that pray in public. There's
[1:13:51] going to be some that preach in silence
[1:13:53] and there's going to be some that preach
[1:13:55] in public. There's going to be some that
[1:13:58] witness the Holy Ghost in private and
[1:14:00] some that witness it in the public.
[1:14:03] There is many diversities. But notice
[1:14:06] this. Let me remind you about the 11th
[1:14:08] hour worker. He came in at the last
[1:14:11] moment, but he got the same pay. He had
[1:14:14] the same power. He had the same
[1:14:16] anointing. So whether you pray in public
[1:14:19] or pray in private, God has not forsaken
[1:14:22] you. Whether you hallelujah, whether you
[1:14:25] sing, whether you dance, God has not
[1:14:28] left you alone. You get the same
[1:14:31] Hallelujah. You little housewives, you
[1:14:33] get the same pay as a preacher. and the
[1:14:36] pastor that gets up every weekend and
[1:14:39] declares that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:14:41] yesterday, today, and forever. But what
[1:14:44] matters is the field that you're working
[1:14:46] in.
[1:14:49] Don't let Satan tell you you're too late
[1:14:51] to run.
[1:14:53] Don't let him tell you you're too late.
[1:14:54] I say it's time to get in the field. I'd
[1:14:57] say it's time to get in and run with
[1:14:58] this message, to do everything that you
[1:15:01] got so that you can hear those words,
[1:15:04] well done.
[1:15:06] Well, nobody sees me. It doesn't matter
[1:15:08] who sees you.
[1:15:11] One time, one time when JFK was walking
[1:15:15] through the NASA, he was walking through
[1:15:17] the NASA uh this the the space exhibits
[1:15:21] there and he was he was walking down
[1:15:23] through there and there he was walking
[1:15:26] through he was walking through and just
[1:15:28] checking out and they was giving him a
[1:15:29] full tour of NASA's facilities and all
[1:15:32] these things. JFK comes upon a janitor
[1:15:36] that is working there and he's just
[1:15:38] sweeping the
[1:15:39] floor. JFK asked him said, "Now, what do
[1:15:42] you do here?" And without reservation,
[1:15:45] he said, "Well, I'm help Mr. President.
[1:15:46] I'm helping put a man on the moon."
[1:15:50] He didn't stand there and say, "You know
[1:15:51] what? I I just sweep around here and I
[1:15:54] just clean up everybody else's mess."
[1:15:56] But he recognized that his task was as
[1:15:59] important as the astronaut that got in
[1:16:01] there. And if you can ever come to that
[1:16:03] spot in your life that it isn't about
[1:16:05] title, it isn't about association, it
[1:16:08] isn't about who sees you, but it matters
[1:16:11] if you're doing it for the right
[1:16:12] reasons. When we were in the middle of a
[1:16:14] space race, there was a janitor that
[1:16:17] recognized his position. And if you can
[1:16:19] recognize your
[1:16:22] position, if you can recognize the power
[1:16:24] of prayer, if you can recognize about a
[1:16:26] mama being a token mama,
[1:16:33] hallelujah. Another man was said in the
[1:16:34] Philadelphiaian church age, "Now works
[1:16:37] are fine, they don't save you. They
[1:16:40] don't make you perfect. It is Christ
[1:16:42] that perishes. It is not even Christ and
[1:16:44] works. It is Christ alone." This age
[1:16:47] began the years of our manyism and does
[1:16:50] not believe in Christ that does not
[1:16:52] believe in Christ as the reality. It
[1:16:55] does not sing of nothing but the blood
[1:16:57] for it sings nothing but the blood in my
[1:16:59] own conduct. I believe in good conduct.
[1:17:01] He said if you're saved you will do
[1:17:03] righteously. We have already gone over
[1:17:05] that. But let me tell you now salvation
[1:17:08] is not Jesus plus. It is Jesus alone.
[1:17:11] Salvation is of the Lord from start to
[1:17:14] finish. It is, oh God. Let his life be
[1:17:17] in me. Let his blood cleanses me. Let it
[1:17:20] be his spirit that fills me. Let it be
[1:17:22] his word in my heart and my mouth. Let
[1:17:25] it be his stripes that heal me. Let it
[1:17:27] be Jesus and Jesus alone. Not by works
[1:17:30] of righteousness which I have done, but
[1:17:32] Christ is my life. When you look at
[1:17:35] Noah, why was he pushed so hard to build
[1:17:39] an ark? It was what he was typifying.
[1:17:43] You look at Abraham where it says that
[1:17:45] he was faithful in the promises. What
[1:17:47] zeal did Abraham have that would push
[1:17:50] him against hope to believe in hope?
[1:17:54] Why? There was something calling him to
[1:17:57] produce a seed to produce and manifest.
[1:18:03] Hallelujah. They had a zeal to do the
[1:18:06] work of the Lord and to produce that
[1:18:09] seed. You say, "What was pushing them?"
[1:18:11] Brother Andrew,
[1:18:14] predestination. What pushes you to push
[1:18:17] and push and persevere.
[1:18:22] It isn't your own human ability. It
[1:18:24] isn't your own human makeup. It isn't
[1:18:27] the family that you're born in. Because
[1:18:29] notice in the parable in Matthew 25, the
[1:18:34] abilities were in them, but the talents
[1:18:37] gave came from the master. He gave them
[1:18:40] stock of his own kingdom. So let me say
[1:18:44] it like this. He gave them the message
[1:18:46] of the hour. He put it in their hand. He
[1:18:49] give them over,200 sermons to listen to.
[1:18:51] He gave them everything they had need
[1:18:53] of. And he looked on them and said, "Go
[1:18:56] out there and build my kingdom." They
[1:18:59] didn't get it on their own. They didn't
[1:19:01] have that on their own. They got it from
[1:19:03] the master.
[1:19:07] Hallelujah. They got it from the master.
[1:19:10] Notice what the scriptures characterize
[1:19:13] them as
[1:19:15] diligent,
[1:19:16] faithful, and they went and
[1:19:19] traded. They put the money that the
[1:19:22] master entrusted
[1:19:24] with that he he entrusted them with it
[1:19:28] and they begin to put it into use. They
[1:19:31] begin to witness like Acts 1:8 said that
[1:19:35] you will be a witness unto me after
[1:19:36] powers come upon you. They begin to take
[1:19:39] the message and put it in its intended
[1:19:42] use. And not only did they go out and
[1:19:45] sew it, but they brought forth many
[1:19:47] returns. And I love what the scripture
[1:19:49] said that as soon as the master was gone
[1:19:53] that immediately they begin to apply the
[1:19:55] stock that the master had given and they
[1:19:58] begin to go immediately and trade. I
[1:20:01] love when people would come to the
[1:20:02] prophet said now do I go to seminary?
[1:20:04] I've been I feel like I'm I feel like
[1:20:06] I'm a real Christian. I feel like God's
[1:20:07] called me to do something. Do I go to a
[1:20:09] seminary? He said absolutely not. He
[1:20:11] said while your candle's lit go out
[1:20:13] there and run your race. They didn't
[1:20:16] wait to go out there and sew their seed.
[1:20:18] They didn't go out there and start
[1:20:20] making trade. They went out there
[1:20:21] immediately.
[1:20:28] You look about Jesus's life. He didn't
[1:20:31] waste no time getting
[1:20:33] started. He didn't waste no time getting
[1:20:35] started. He recognized what he was born
[1:20:38] for. And if you can come to that
[1:20:40] position in life, what you've been
[1:20:42] raised for and what you were born for.
[1:20:45] And Jesus comes and you find him at the
[1:20:48] early age of 12 years old and he's
[1:20:50] standing there and he's teaching
[1:20:51] scholars. He's beginning to he's
[1:20:53] beginning to teach them and take them
[1:20:54] through the scriptures and his mother is
[1:20:56] looking for him. He said, "Don't you
[1:20:58] know that I'll be about my father's
[1:21:00] business?" Jesus consumed himself with
[1:21:04] the father's business. I was reading I
[1:21:06] was reading in a in a in a message
[1:21:08] brother Maram said and he was talking
[1:21:10] about the maniac of Gada. He said what
[1:21:13] was driving Jesus? He said he was so
[1:21:16] possessed with the father's with the
[1:21:18] father's business. He said he was so
[1:21:20] possessed. He said he'd been out there
[1:21:22] all day and all night healing the sick
[1:21:25] and preaching to them and teaching them.
[1:21:27] He said but he took a chance.
[1:21:30] He took a chance and he got out there on
[1:21:33] them roaring waves with a chance. Do you
[1:21:36] want to hear what the prophet said? He
[1:21:38] said the reason he took a chance was for
[1:21:41] one soul.
[1:21:43] Because he wanted to get to that maniac.
[1:21:47] He was tired. He was weary. You look at
[1:21:50] the missionaries that we have in this
[1:21:52] message that give all that they've got
[1:21:55] for the message of the hour. They put
[1:21:57] themselves in dangers. They put
[1:21:59] themselves in sometimes prison
[1:22:03] situations, just for a
[1:22:06] chance. You think about your pastor in
[1:22:08] China. He was this close to being put in
[1:22:11] prison, but it was for a chance. And I'd
[1:22:14] say that chance paid off.
[1:22:17] You look at you look at the times that
[1:22:19] brother Ed Bisll was locked up and you
[1:22:21] look at these other brothers for a
[1:22:23] chance at one.
[1:22:26] They don't have to hear me say it, but I
[1:22:28] say well done.
[1:22:31] I say well
[1:22:37] done. But here's it. Jesus recognized he
[1:22:41] was a son under commission to do the
[1:22:43] works of the father. And you realize
[1:22:45] this that if a man is born of the word,
[1:22:47] he will produce that word, his life, his
[1:22:50] fruit, his works will be a product of
[1:22:53] the seed that God
[1:22:57] deposited. You don't have to make it
[1:23:00] happen. The sheep does not have to
[1:23:02] manufacture wool. It just simply grows
[1:23:04] out. Amen. You notice when the master
[1:23:08] comes to him, he comes to them and he
[1:23:11] gives some five, some two, and some
[1:23:14] one. But you
[1:23:16] notice, you notice the master's
[1:23:19] words to the five and to the
[1:23:23] two. He says the same
[1:23:27] thing. He doesn't change his verbiage.
[1:23:30] He doesn't change what he says, but he
[1:23:33] simply says the same
[1:23:37] thing. Come on now. He says the same
[1:23:41] thing. The master is praising the one
[1:23:44] that had five and he got five. He's
[1:23:46] praising the one that had two and he got
[1:23:48] two. So God is showing us that he values
[1:23:53] faithfulness over top the magnitude of
[1:23:56] what you bring in. Are you with me? He
[1:23:59] vows you
[1:24:00] magnitude over it. He vows you more than
[1:24:03] your accomplishments.
[1:24:05] It's what you're doing with what you've
[1:24:07] been given.
[1:24:09] I say it's high time that David rise up
[1:24:13] and take what he's been given. Take what
[1:24:16] he's been given and do something for the
[1:24:18] kingdom of God. God's not going to
[1:24:20] measure you. I'm so thankful for that.
[1:24:23] I'm thankful that God's not going to
[1:24:24] measure me to the caliber of the
[1:24:27] accomplishments of William Brandham
[1:24:30] cuz there's no way in my lifetime that I
[1:24:33] could ever accomplish near or 1% of what
[1:24:36] he did. I'm so thankful that I don't
[1:24:38] have to accomplish what Ed Bisll did and
[1:24:40] what Ron Spencer did. But all God is
[1:24:43] requiring of me is I take what I've been
[1:24:47] given
[1:24:48] and I do something with it for the
[1:24:51] kingdom of
[1:24:52] God. Come on, mas, come on, daddies.
[1:24:55] Come on, young people. What has been put
[1:24:57] in your hand?
[1:25:02] Will it be said of you, cast
[1:25:05] out, cast out the
[1:25:08] unfaithful? Cast out the one that can't
[1:25:12] produce anything. Cast out the one that
[1:25:14] that never spent no time spreading my
[1:25:17] gospel and telling somebody about Jesus.
[1:25:20] Or will he say, "Good and faithful
[1:25:24] servant. Well done. Enter into the joys
[1:25:28] of the Lord.
[1:25:30] You notice the scripture in Isaiah 9
[1:25:33] and6 when he comes to establish his
[1:25:36] kingdom. This is how he establishes it.
[1:25:39] That unto us a child is born and unto us
[1:25:41] a son is given and the government shall
[1:25:44] be upon his shoulders and his name shall
[1:25:46] be called wonderful counselor of the
[1:25:47] mighty God, the everlasting father, the
[1:25:50] prince of peace. of the increase of his
[1:25:52] government and peace there shall be no
[1:25:53] end upon the throne of David and upon
[1:25:56] his kingdom to order it and to establish
[1:25:58] it with judgment and justice from
[1:26:00] henceforth even forever. The zeal of the
[1:26:04] Lord of hosts will perform this that
[1:26:07] word zeal it denotes an order or an
[1:26:10] intense desire in accomplishing the
[1:26:14] object that is ahead. And when Jesus
[1:26:16] when the word comes to the prophet that
[1:26:19] he's going to establish his kingdom, he
[1:26:21] was going to establish his kingdom. He
[1:26:24] simply says that the zeal of Yahweh is
[1:26:27] going to be the one that performs it.
[1:26:30] Nothing else is going to do it. You're
[1:26:32] not going to get the last seat here, but
[1:26:34] the zeal of the Lord will do it. You're
[1:26:36] not going to have to produce a baby
[1:26:38] Mary, but the zeal of the Lord will do
[1:26:40] it. Isaiah, it's not up to you to
[1:26:42] fulfill the prophecy, but the zeal of
[1:26:44] the Lord will do it. I don't have to
[1:26:46] produce a bride, but the zeal of the
[1:26:48] Lord will do it.
[1:26:52] It's not up to me if you make the
[1:26:55] rapture or not, but it's the zeal of the
[1:26:57] Lord that will perform a body change.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah.
[1:27:05] So if Jehovah has an intense desire to
[1:27:10] fulfill his promise, how much more as
[1:27:13] sons and daughters of God? Now God
[1:27:15] didn't give out all the
[1:27:17] details. He didn't give out the details
[1:27:19] how he was going to do it, how that he
[1:27:22] was going to wait 800 years. He didn't
[1:27:24] give out the details of how Mary was
[1:27:27] going to be espoused to Joseph and
[1:27:30] Joseph was going to want to put her away
[1:27:32] privately. He didn't give the details of
[1:27:34] that. He didn't give the details of her
[1:27:36] age. He didn't give the details of where
[1:27:39] she was going to grow up. He just simply
[1:27:41] said, "This is how I'm going to
[1:27:42] establish my
[1:27:44] kingdom, and it's my zeal that's going
[1:27:46] to perform it." He didn't say in the
[1:27:48] scripture in Malachi 4 that he was going
[1:27:50] to raise up a hillbilly Kentucky, but he
[1:27:53] simply said the zeal of the Lord's going
[1:27:54] to perform it. He doesn't always give an
[1:27:57] answer, but zeal is seen in the Hebrew
[1:28:01] as God's passion. God was passionate to
[1:28:05] bring his word to
[1:28:08] pass. It is said that zeal in the Greek
[1:28:13] is like a love and a fervor.
[1:28:17] of a jealous
[1:28:19] husband. Not jealous in the sense of
[1:28:22] jealousy, but
[1:28:24] jealous like our
[1:28:27] father that Paul would say, "I am
[1:28:30] jealous over you with a godly
[1:28:33] jealousy." And God is passionate about
[1:28:37] his word coming to pass. Let me say, let
[1:28:40] me say this to you. Just like Mary was
[1:28:44] born to see the performance of the Lord
[1:28:46] in her life, you have been born for such
[1:28:49] an hour as this. And you don't have to
[1:28:52] work it up. You simply know that God is
[1:28:56] has a passion. He's got a passion for
[1:28:59] his bride. He's got a passion for this
[1:29:01] word. He's got a passion for a virgin
[1:29:04] wife. He's got a passion for a womb that
[1:29:07] he could that he could literally put his
[1:29:09] his personal seed in that will result in
[1:29:13] eternal life. And there he doesn't have
[1:29:16] to
[1:29:17] worry. He don't have to worry about her.
[1:29:21] The husband doesn't have to worry about
[1:29:22] his wife because he's locked this seed
[1:29:26] on the inside of her womb. And brother
[1:29:29] Brandham said, "You can't go out and
[1:29:30] commit adultery because your womb is
[1:29:33] already sealed.
[1:29:34] You can't go out and flirt around with
[1:29:36] other men because your womb's already
[1:29:38] been sealed. Your soul's been sealed.
[1:29:41] And God is passionate.
[1:29:44] God is passionate to pregnant the body
[1:29:47] of Jesus Christ with his own seed word.
[1:29:51] So Satan showed up too late.
[1:29:55] He showed up too late. That's what he
[1:29:57] was trying to do to Eve. That's what he
[1:29:59] was trying to do to Sarah. That's what
[1:30:01] he was trying to do to Tamar. That's
[1:30:03] what he was trying to do to Rahab. He
[1:30:05] was trying to fill their womb with
[1:30:07] contaminated seed. But the zeal of the
[1:30:10] Lord,
[1:30:12] the zeal of the Lord kept them for the
[1:30:18] hour.
[1:30:20] Woo. Good to be home.
[1:30:26] Well, you say, "Well, how am I going to
[1:30:27] get through this? I don't have the
[1:30:29] strength to get through it." I say the
[1:30:31] word is a living word. He'll give you
[1:30:34] the resistance to deflect every negative
[1:30:37] thought. He'll give you the resistance
[1:30:38] to stand against all the gates of hell.
[1:30:41] For Isaiah 40 and 29 says, he giveth
[1:30:44] power to the faint and to them that have
[1:30:46] no might. He increases
[1:30:51] strength. Even the youth shall faint and
[1:30:54] be weary. And the young men shall
[1:30:56] utterly fail fall. But they that wait
[1:30:58] upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:31:01] strength. They shall mount up with wings
[1:31:03] as eagles. They shall run and not be
[1:31:05] weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[1:31:07] What are you saying, brother Angel? I'm
[1:31:09] saying that the zeal of the Lord. If
[1:31:11] this if this zeal of the Lord is in you,
[1:31:14] it consumes you. It possesses your
[1:31:17] reigns. All you know to do is the word
[1:31:20] of the Lord.
[1:31:22] Let me say no matter what comes, if
[1:31:24] you've got this zeal, this passion for
[1:31:26] the word, you cannot be deterred.
[1:31:30] I'm going to preach to you. You can't be
[1:31:32] deterred from Satan's mission. You can't
[1:31:34] be deterred by by simply others ideas,
[1:31:38] but you have a passion. You have a zeal
[1:31:41] to bear the seed, to manifest the seed,
[1:31:45] to produce what God has ordained.
[1:31:54] This zeal is more than an
[1:31:56] occupation. This zeal is more than a
[1:32:00] profession. But it's a godly
[1:32:04] zealous. It's a divine
[1:32:07] mission. It's kind of like God sending
[1:32:11] out his super agents.
[1:32:15] God's sending out his super agents to go
[1:32:18] out there and spy out Canaan. And
[1:32:20] there's going to be all kinds of people
[1:32:22] that don't have the zeal that you have.
[1:32:24] They don't have the anointing that you
[1:32:26] have. They don't have the walk that you
[1:32:27] have. They don't have the understanding
[1:32:29] that you have. They can't walk where you
[1:32:31] walk. They can't climb in realms where
[1:32:33] you climb. But God has ordain ordained
[1:32:36] you and anointed you to walk up there.
[1:32:39] Walk up there. And there's going to be
[1:32:40] 10 other people that say, "We can't go
[1:32:42] up there." There's going to be 10 other
[1:32:44] spies that go up and say, "We can't have
[1:32:46] this." Now, they were zealous because
[1:32:48] they watched Moses stand there. But in
[1:32:50] fight, in spite in spite of it all,
[1:32:53] there was two, Joshua and Caleb. And
[1:32:56] they wasn't afraid. They wasn't afraid
[1:32:58] by what they saw. They just saw the
[1:33:01] bigger the giant, the harder they fell.
[1:33:04] They was not pushed around by other
[1:33:06] people's ideas. They was not pushed
[1:33:08] around by what men said. They was not
[1:33:10] pushed around by people saying that the
[1:33:12] days of miracles is passed. They simply
[1:33:14] said, "My God is more than able."
[1:33:19] They had a godly jealousy to perform the
[1:33:22] word of the Lord.
[1:33:28] It
[1:33:29] wasn't it wasn't something their daddy
[1:33:31] handed down to them. It wasn't something
[1:33:33] their granddaddy handed down to them.
[1:33:35] This was a personal revelation.
[1:33:40] It's kind of like the woman with a blood
[1:33:42] issue. That wasn't somebody else's
[1:33:46] idea. And like Jarius last night, it
[1:33:49] wasn't somebody else's
[1:33:51] idea. It was his personal revelation.
[1:33:54] Now, where did she get that? Where did
[1:33:56] she get that revelation from? It was a
[1:33:58] zeal of the Lord to perform the
[1:34:02] word. And that word anchored in her
[1:34:05] heart. and she simply got to Jesus.
[1:34:09] That's why Caleb and Joshua, they didn't
[1:34:11] put that self, they didn't put that
[1:34:13] there. But God was going to have a
[1:34:16] witness.
[1:34:18] When God anchored that womb, that word
[1:34:21] on the inside of
[1:34:24] Mary, you read the
[1:34:27] scriptures. Joseph didn't understand
[1:34:31] it. He was betrod to her. He had his
[1:34:35] doubts. He was wanting to put her away.
[1:34:38] He was going to bring a bad name to
[1:34:40] him. But all of a sudden, he had a
[1:34:42] conference with an
[1:34:45] angel. And Revelation set
[1:34:48] in. I want I wanted to just paint this
[1:34:51] for you. He was a red-blooded
[1:34:56] man. He was a red-blooded male.
[1:35:01] He put away his fleshly desires for a
[1:35:04] wife to make sure that the seed was
[1:35:08] protected
[1:35:10] because he did not Hallelujah. He did
[1:35:12] not want to entangle himself. He wanted
[1:35:16] to simply be in the fulfillment of the
[1:35:18] angel's message. He simply wanted to
[1:35:21] line himself up there with a godly
[1:35:23] zealousness to bring and perform the
[1:35:26] word of the Lord. So he put aside his
[1:35:29] flesh. And that's got to be the way you
[1:35:32] got to do in your own life. You got to
[1:35:34] put aside your flesh. You got to put
[1:35:36] aside your wants and your desires and
[1:35:38] your ideas. You got to put aside your
[1:35:41] fleshly things. Sure, you want to go out
[1:35:43] and have a good time. Sure, there's a
[1:35:45] lot of things in Leoya that we can
[1:35:47] enjoy. But you got to do like Joseph and
[1:35:50] put aside your flesh so the seed can
[1:35:53] manifest to its true origin.
[1:35:58] Let me let me just come come this
[1:36:03] way. Heaven does not keep score like we
[1:36:06] do
[1:36:11] because the
[1:36:13] earth celebrates
[1:36:15] influence. The earth celebrates numbers
[1:36:18] and popularity and performance. But
[1:36:20] heaven celebrates obedience, humility,
[1:36:23] and faithfulness.
[1:36:26] Jesus said in Luke 16:15, "For that
[1:36:29] which is highly esteemed amongst men is
[1:36:31] an abomination in the sight of God." You
[1:36:34] remember the woman with the two mites
[1:36:36] when she was standing there and she
[1:36:37] threw all that she had. There was some
[1:36:39] men that was standing there were rich
[1:36:41] men and they they gave in of their
[1:36:42] abundance. But this little woman came in
[1:36:45] there. She came in there and she gave
[1:36:47] all that she had. She didn't hold
[1:36:49] nothing back. She gave all of her
[1:36:50] living. She was kind of like had it
[1:36:52] right. She gave all that she had. And
[1:36:54] because she gave all that she had, God
[1:36:56] remembered her. And Jesus said that this
[1:36:59] woman, she's the one that's done the
[1:37:01] right thing. She gave everything she's
[1:37:03] got. I don't want to be the man that had
[1:37:06] the message and I didn't run with it.
[1:37:08] But I want to be the man that gave all I
[1:37:11] got. Come on, somebody. I want to run
[1:37:14] with every energy in me. I want to push
[1:37:17] for every seed. I want to preach till
[1:37:19] every prodal comes back home. I want to
[1:37:21] preach to every devil's cast
[1:37:25] out. I'd wear I'd rather wear out than
[1:37:28] rust out any day. I want to run. I want
[1:37:32] to chase. I want to
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:39] follow. Moses was filled with zeal.
[1:37:42] David was sealed was filled with zeal.
[1:37:46] Nobody else would stand up but David
[1:37:48] would.
[1:37:50] Moses threw himself in a breach. What
[1:37:53] was it? It was of the zeal of the Lord.
[1:37:55] Brother man said, "I always question
[1:37:57] that. How did God How did he not smite
[1:38:00] Moses for standing in the breach of them
[1:38:02] people that was condemning God?" He
[1:38:04] said, "But then I seen it was Christ and
[1:38:06] Moses." What was it? It was a zeal of
[1:38:09] the Lord to perform
[1:38:11] it. What was it in Paul? What was it in
[1:38:15] Mary Magdalene? What was it in Daniel?
[1:38:18] These Old Testament prophets had a zeal
[1:38:22] to bring forth a seed and to manifest
[1:38:25] it. Look at William Brandham. He was
[1:38:28] running not on emotion, but he was
[1:38:31] running on the zeal of the Lord.
[1:38:35] And William Brandham could have had all
[1:38:36] the applause of men that he wanted to.
[1:38:41] With his gift, he could have owned this
[1:38:43] world.
[1:38:45] But I want you to know that private
[1:38:47] obedience is better than public applause
[1:38:52] because Jesus said in Matthew 6:4 that
[1:38:54] thine arms may be in secret and thy
[1:38:56] father which seeth in secret
[1:38:59] himself shall reward thee
[1:39:01] openly. What are you saying? I'm saying
[1:39:03] you may not get no applause here.
[1:39:06] There's many things that are done in
[1:39:08] this church and I could call their names
[1:39:11] because I have insight. men that do
[1:39:14] things for this church, women that do
[1:39:15] things for this church, and they don't
[1:39:17] do it for your applause, they don't do
[1:39:19] it for my applause, they simply do it
[1:39:21] for the cause of Jesus Christ. But then
[1:39:23] there's people in churches, not maybe
[1:39:26] not this church because we're all
[1:39:27] angels, that simply do things because
[1:39:29] they want somebody to pat them on the
[1:39:31] back.
[1:39:33] I know that ain't
[1:39:34] here, but who cares who sees it and who
[1:39:38] doesn't see it? As long as a father sees
[1:39:41] it.
[1:39:47] Now
[1:39:49] look in Matthew 25 he said he gave unto
[1:39:52] them according to their own
[1:39:55] ability. So God is not going to judge
[1:39:57] you according to what others have.
[1:40:01] He's going to judge you and heaven is
[1:40:04] going to keep score according to the
[1:40:06] what God's given you and what you do for
[1:40:09] it. He's not going to hold me
[1:40:11] accountable for what brother William
[1:40:12] does and brother Ron does. He's going to
[1:40:14] hold me accountable for what I do.
[1:40:18] What are you saying, brother? I'm saying
[1:40:20] I want to do everything within my power
[1:40:23] to hear those two words.
[1:40:26] Well done. Amen.
[1:40:29] And Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 and 13,
[1:40:32] "Every man's work shall be made
[1:40:33] manifest. For the days shall declare it,
[1:40:37] because it shall be revealed by fire,
[1:40:39] and the fire shall trial try every man's
[1:40:41] work of what sort it is. And if any
[1:40:44] man's work abide, which he hath built
[1:40:46] thereon, he shall receive a reward." And
[1:40:51] I begin to look at that and I begin to
[1:40:54] think about the reward of the overcomers
[1:40:56] in all the seven church ages. That the
[1:40:59] overcomer is the heir of all things. The
[1:41:03] overcomer overcomes by the word. It's
[1:41:05] not what he has to overcome, but it's
[1:41:07] how he overcomes. You look in
[1:41:09] Revelations 2 and 7, the spirit says,
[1:41:12] I'll give him that overcomer in the
[1:41:14] Ephesian church age. I'll give to eat of
[1:41:16] the tree of life which is in the midst
[1:41:18] of the paradise. In Revelations 2:11, he
[1:41:22] said that he that overcomemeth shall not
[1:41:24] be hurt of the second death. So God is
[1:41:26] granting you eternal life to the
[1:41:29] believer. In the pgamin church age, it
[1:41:31] says that I will to him that
[1:41:33] overcomemeth will I give to eat of the
[1:41:35] hidden mana and I will give him a white
[1:41:38] stone and in the stone a new name
[1:41:41] written. It always God always has hidden
[1:41:45] strength for his believers just like the
[1:41:48] widow. Just like the woman, he had
[1:41:51] hidden mana there. And it was under
[1:41:54] Revelations 10:7 that all the mana that
[1:41:57] is given to the children is now here.
[1:42:00] And you can feast daily on it. In
[1:42:02] Revelations 3:5, it said, "He that's
[1:42:04] overcometh the shame shall be clothed in
[1:42:06] white raignment. And I will not blot out
[1:42:09] his name." Hallelujah. I will not blot
[1:42:12] out his name out of the book of life,
[1:42:14] but I will confess his name before my
[1:42:17] father and his angels. Brother Brandham
[1:42:19] said he is going to reward them that
[1:42:22] follow this advice. Brother Brandham, I
[1:42:24] was reading it this morning. Brother
[1:42:26] Brandham said, don't he said they had an
[1:42:28] old saying. He said, keep your skirts
[1:42:30] clean. Keep your skirt clean. He said it
[1:42:33] simply meant this is don't involve
[1:42:35] yourself in things that you don't need
[1:42:37] to be involved in.
[1:42:39] In the Philadelphiaian church age, it
[1:42:41] says, "Him that overcomemeth will I make
[1:42:43] a pillar in the temple of my God." I
[1:42:47] want to read this to
[1:42:49] you. Brother Man said, let let me let me
[1:42:52] go back and read verse 11 so to capture
[1:42:54] the full view for you. He said, "Behold,
[1:42:56] I come quickly. Hold that fast which
[1:42:58] thou hast and no man take thy crown. Him
[1:43:01] that overcomemeth will I make a pillar
[1:43:04] in the temple of my God. And he shall go
[1:43:06] no more out. And I will write upon him
[1:43:08] the name of my God, and the name of the
[1:43:10] city of my God, which is New Jerusalem,
[1:43:13] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[1:43:14] God, and I will write upon him my new
[1:43:17] name. Now notice what brother Manner
[1:43:19] says in the church age, in the
[1:43:20] Philadelphiaian church age, he said, now
[1:43:22] he has not only given crowns, but he
[1:43:24] says that these in the bride will be
[1:43:27] made pillars in the temple of God. But
[1:43:30] what is the temple of God? Jesus spoke
[1:43:33] of his body as being the temple. It was
[1:43:36] it was the temple of God. But now that
[1:43:39] we are in his body, the true church is
[1:43:42] the temple of God by the Holy Ghost
[1:43:44] within us. Now he's going to try to make
[1:43:46] that overcomer a pillar in the temple.
[1:43:49] But what is a
[1:43:51] pillar? A pillar is
[1:43:57] actually Hallelujah. A pillar is
[1:44:00] actually a part of the foundation for it
[1:44:03] upholds the
[1:44:06] superructure. Praise God. That puts the
[1:44:10] overcomer right in with the apostles and
[1:44:12] prophets. Ephesians 2:19
[1:44:16] says, "Now therefore, you are no more
[1:44:19] strangers and foreigners, but fellow
[1:44:20] citizens with the saints of the
[1:44:22] household of God, and are built upon the
[1:44:24] foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[1:44:26] Jesus Christ himself being the chief
[1:44:29] cornerstone, in whom we all in whom the
[1:44:32] all the body fitly framed together,
[1:44:34] groweth into a holy temple in the Lord,
[1:44:38] in whom you are also builded together
[1:44:41] for a habitation of God through the
[1:44:45] spirit.
[1:44:48] The reward of all the overcomers of all
[1:44:52] the ages from Ephesians all the way to
[1:44:56] brother Brandham said it pertains to
[1:44:59] every
[1:45:00] overcomer but the final one said to him
[1:45:04] that overcomemeth will I grant to sit
[1:45:05] with me in my throne.
[1:45:10] That's the overcomers overcomer's
[1:45:12] highest
[1:45:13] reward. It's the
[1:45:16] privilege to set down and to reign with
[1:45:22] him. God keeps score.
[1:45:27] But nobody else does.
[1:45:30] I love what Paul said in Hebrews
[1:45:33] 6:10. God is not unjust to forget your
[1:45:37] work and your labor of love.
[1:45:44] He sees how
[1:45:46] you took oil with
[1:45:49] you when others forgot
[1:45:52] it. He sees how you stayed in prayer
[1:45:56] when others couldn't pray.
[1:46:01] God keeps score based on finishing and
[1:46:05] not
[1:46:07] starting. Because Paul said to those
[1:46:10] that walked away, he said, "You did run
[1:46:13] well, but who hindered
[1:46:16] you?" Paul said in 2 Timothy 4:7, "I
[1:46:19] fought a good fight, and I finished my
[1:46:21] course. I've kept the faith. Henceforth,
[1:46:24] there is laid up for me a crown of
[1:46:26] righteousness, which the Lord, the
[1:46:28] righteous judge, shall give me at that
[1:46:30] day, not to me only, but to them also
[1:46:33] that love his appearing."
[1:46:36] Paul received a crown for not starting.
[1:46:38] He received a crown for
[1:46:41] finishing. There's a lot of people
[1:46:43] that's got a lot of
[1:46:44] energy in
[1:46:47] 1965. There's a lot of people that had a
[1:46:50] lot of energy in
[1:46:52] 1977. There's a lot of people that had a
[1:46:54] lot of energy when they begin to see
[1:46:56] modern events being made clear by
[1:46:57] prophecy. And there's going to be a lot
[1:46:59] of people that are are real they're real
[1:47:01] zealous when when Los Angeles falls
[1:47:04] underneath the ocean. There's going to
[1:47:06] be a lot of people zealous when they
[1:47:08] start riding in cars and it starts
[1:47:10] driving them down the road. What are you
[1:47:11] waiting on?
[1:47:14] There's a lot of people that's had a lot
[1:47:16] of energy when they were sitting in this
[1:47:18] building. There's a lot of people that
[1:47:20] had a lot of energy when they had the
[1:47:21] pastor with them. But when you wasn't
[1:47:24] with your pastor and when you wasn't in
[1:47:27] this atmosphere, can it be said about
[1:47:29] you? Well done.
[1:47:34] I love this.
[1:47:37] Notice I finished my course.
[1:47:41] You know that when Solomon writes out
[1:47:43] the book of Ecclesiastes in chapter 3,
[1:47:46] there's 14 pairs of times and seasons
[1:47:49] that that Solomon begins to type back
[1:47:51] and forth. He begins to say, "It's a
[1:47:53] time of season. It's time to sow. It's
[1:47:54] time to reap. It's time this. It's time
[1:47:55] to kill. It's time to die. It's time to
[1:47:57] win. It's time." You remember what he
[1:47:59] says
[1:48:00] there. But he never says it's time to
[1:48:02] quit. He never says there's a time to
[1:48:05] back up. He never says there's a time to
[1:48:07] give in. But he simply said, he simply
[1:48:10] said there's a time for victory. I'd say
[1:48:12] what are you waiting on? It's time to
[1:48:15] run with everything that's within you.
[1:48:18] That's right. Paul said, "The
[1:48:21] crown, it goes to the
[1:48:24] faithful. To him that endures temptation
[1:48:28] shall receive the crown of life. And
[1:48:30] when the chief shepherd, Peter said,
[1:48:32] shall appear, you shall receive the
[1:48:34] crown of glory. The fateth not
[1:48:37] await, there is laid up for me a
[1:48:40] crown of righteousness."
[1:48:44] What will be said about
[1:48:51] you? I want to have a real sovereign
[1:48:55] moment. What will be said about
[1:49:07] you? Did you dig it? put it in the
[1:49:10] ground because you were fearful of what
[1:49:12] he was commanding you to do with this
[1:49:16] message. Was you ashamed of that
[1:49:23] picture? There's going to be some people
[1:49:25] that are called to preach and there's
[1:49:26] some people that's called to witness on
[1:49:28] the
[1:49:29] street. God's a God that all lots that.
[1:49:32] What' you do with what you have been
[1:49:33] given?
[1:49:36] Been going through the seals lately.
[1:49:39] been listening to him over and over
[1:49:41] again. And I I was coming down to the
[1:49:42] end of the sixth
[1:49:44] seal. I heard a prophet. He said, "Now
[1:49:47] this was a
[1:49:48] dream." He said, "This was a dream." He
[1:49:51] said, he said, "There," he said, "we
[1:49:53] standing before." He said, "There I
[1:49:55] was." He was standing. He said, "Now,"
[1:49:56] he said, "Now this was not the
[1:49:58] judgment." He said, "But this was when
[1:50:00] crowns were given out."
[1:50:03] And he said, "Jesus is standing there
[1:50:05] and the recording angel." He said there
[1:50:08] was masses of people that was standing
[1:50:10] there and he said out of that out of
[1:50:14] that corridor was white ivory
[1:50:16] steps and I I they caught my attention
[1:50:18] because I was just given a gift that was
[1:50:21] made out of ivory. My ears begin to
[1:50:23] prick up and I I hear these I heard this
[1:50:26] thing. Brother Baron said, "Out of that
[1:50:28] out of those
[1:50:29] steps," he said, "thos ivory steps." He
[1:50:32] said, "It was like a panoramic." And he
[1:50:34] said, "They wind it down this way." And
[1:50:36] he said, "There standing there," he
[1:50:38] said, "was the recording
[1:50:43] angel. There was a recording angel."
[1:50:46] Brother Marham said, "I was standing
[1:50:48] there and he said, I could hear him
[1:50:50] saying he would call out this name." And
[1:50:53] he said, brother M said, I pricricked up
[1:50:54] and said, I know that name. And the
[1:50:57] voice
[1:50:58] said, well done, my good and faithful
[1:51:01] servant. Enter into the joys of the
[1:51:03] Lord. He said, he said, I watched them.
[1:51:06] He said, as they entered into that city,
[1:51:08] he said, they went over on the high
[1:51:10] mountains and the high places. And he
[1:51:11] said, he said, and went in there. I
[1:51:14] found it amazing that they do exactly
[1:51:16] what we do here. He said they was
[1:51:18] dancing and shouting and hollering.
[1:51:22] When they heard that word, well done, he
[1:51:26] said, I heard another name. He said,
[1:51:27] well, I know that name. He said, I was
[1:51:29] standing there. He said, I was just
[1:51:31] watching. He said, I was having myself a
[1:51:32] time of my life. He said, watching my
[1:51:34] brothers and my sisters walk in and
[1:51:36] their name was
[1:51:38] called. He said, I knew them on earth.
[1:51:41] He said, I watched them enter in there.
[1:51:43] Well done, good and faithful servant.
[1:51:45] Enter into the joys of the Lord. He
[1:51:47] said, "Then I
[1:51:48] heard," he said, "Then I heard Orman
[1:51:51] Neville's name." He said, "I know him."
[1:51:53] He said, "I know him." He said, "And
[1:51:55] when brother Neville walked in there and
[1:51:56] he said, 'Well done, my good and
[1:51:57] faithful servant. Enter into the joys of
[1:52:00] the Lord." He said, "Brother Neville,"
[1:52:01] he said, he started shouting and started
[1:52:05] hollering. He said, "I was just as happy
[1:52:07] out there watching them." I want to say
[1:52:10] this, Full Gospel Lighthouse, that's the
[1:52:12] way I'll
[1:52:13] be. I knew Jim Noel. I knew Jordan
[1:52:16] Martin. I knew Alen Fraser. I knew Tom
[1:52:19] Hill. I knew Denny Vance. I knew
[1:52:26] them. I want to be standing there that
[1:52:29] day when he says, "Well done, little
[1:52:32] bride. Well done. Well done. You gave it
[1:52:36] all you got. You didn't reserve nothing.
[1:52:39] Well
[1:52:41] done. Well done.
[1:52:49] Hallelujah.
[1:52:56] When Jesus says, "Well done, enter into
[1:52:58] the joy of the Lord." Let the musicians
[1:53:04] come. Enter into the joys of the
[1:53:08] Lord. In the original Greek, brother
[1:53:12] Doug, it means come and celebrate with
[1:53:21] me. Can you
[1:53:23] imagine a
[1:53:27] master and he's watched you through your
[1:53:30] broken heart?
[1:53:32] He's watched you go through the
[1:53:35] struggles of bearing the reproach of the
[1:53:38] name of the Lord Jesus
[1:53:40] Christ. Others condemning you, others
[1:53:43] mocking you and make fun of
[1:53:45] you. But you kept on serving. You kept
[1:53:49] on rowing. You kept passing the time and
[1:53:53] you went through the
[1:53:55] struggles. But the master
[1:53:58] comes says, "Well done.
[1:54:02] Well
[1:54:03] done, Mother
[1:54:04] Ron. I've watched you here on
[1:54:07] earth. I've seen the witness of the Holy
[1:54:10] Ghost in your life.
[1:54:12] I don't have to say well done to you,
[1:54:14] but we as a church say well done.
[1:54:24] But I want to be standing real
[1:54:27] close when I get to see my pastor stand
[1:54:31] there and the master's looking on him
[1:54:34] and the recording angel calls Ron
[1:54:36] Spencer's
[1:54:38] name. And we hear the master say, "Well
[1:54:41] done."
[1:54:43] I don't know if we'll go in before him
[1:54:45] or we'll go in after him, but either
[1:54:47] way, I'm going to be standing there.
[1:54:49] Either way, I'm going to be standing
[1:54:50] real close and I'm going to hear him
[1:54:52] say, "Well done. Well done. Well done.
[1:54:56] Well done. Well done. Well done. Well
[1:55:00] done." God bless
[1:55:10] [Applause]
[1:55:14] you. That's my name.
[1:55:22] my shame pass my blame till he called my
[1:55:29] name I'm so glad he changed darkness
[1:55:32] held me down Jesus pulled me out I'm no
[1:55:37] longer
[1:55:39] bound I'm so glad he changed me see
[1:55:43] now new creation in
[1:55:48] Christ. The old has gone. There's no
[1:55:53] life. I live by faith by
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:56:00] sight. There is a king that's written
[1:56:03] down in
[1:56:05] glory. And it's
[1:56:07] mine. This is mine.
[1:56:11] See, I kept the author of the
[1:56:14] story and it's
[1:56:17] mine. Is
[1:56:19] my sin left by Jesus open my eyes, but
[1:56:25] now I see the
[1:56:27] light. I'm so glad he changed me.

[2:02:19] service we've had this morning, ain't
[2:02:21] we? Amen. I tell you, the glory of the
[2:02:24] Lord has just been with us this weekend.
[2:02:27] Amen. How many do we have here that's
[2:02:29] going to be baptized this morning?
[2:02:31] You just see by way of hands this
[2:02:34] morning. Amen. Glory.
[2:02:38] Hallelujah.
[2:02:45] Hallelujah. Maybe we could have each
[2:02:47] each one of y'all that's going to be
[2:02:48] baptized like to gather here around the
[2:02:50] altar. We just pray with you before we
[2:02:52] go into baptism this morning. Amen. So
[2:02:55] just come down this morning
[2:02:58] here. Amen.
[2:03:15] Amen. Amen. You can be
[2:03:27] seated. Hallelujah.
[2:03:33] Hallelujah. God bless
[2:03:35] you. I tell you what a masterpiece of a
[2:03:38] sermon this morning. Amen.
[2:03:44] Amen.
[2:03:49] Few weeks ago, the Lord laid on my heart
[2:03:52] to have brother William to speak and
[2:03:55] then brother Andrew to speak when he
[2:03:56] after he came home and after this
[2:03:59] weekend I say I believe I was led of the
[2:04:01] Lord.
[2:04:03] Amen.
[2:04:05] Amen. We're so honored to be here for
[2:04:08] you and to help you through this this
[2:04:11] phase of your life.
[2:04:13] And I I'll just speak to you just for a
[2:04:16] moment. Our buddy called me this
[2:04:18] morning. He said, "I want to be
[2:04:20] baptized."
[2:04:23] I just have to tell you, I thought my
[2:04:25] world I thought my heart was going to
[2:04:26] blow up.
[2:04:28] And this is eternal life that we're
[2:04:31] dealing with here.
[2:04:33] For those that know the scriptures, it's
[2:04:36] just kind of common to you. Well, for
[2:04:38] those that are young in the in the
[2:04:40] gospel, in the Old Testament, they would
[2:04:43] take the
[2:04:44] sacrifice and they would take it and
[2:04:47] they would offer it unto God. But before
[2:04:50] they would offer it unto God, they would
[2:04:52] wash it. And our bodies have got to be
[2:04:55] washed. These are bodies that we were
[2:04:58] born in. And and no matter how small you
[2:05:02] are, we're born in sin and shapen
[2:05:04] iniquity. And so God wants our bodies to
[2:05:07] be a living sacrifice. And hey, we can't
[2:05:10] serve the Lord on our
[2:05:12] own. And uh boy, you've got beautiful
[2:05:15] eyes. And we can't serve the Lord on our
[2:05:19] own. We need him to come and live on the
[2:05:23] inside of us.
[2:05:27] Now, when Jesus was standing there with
[2:05:30] his
[2:05:31] disciples and he was telling them to be
[2:05:34] baptized in the name of the father and
[2:05:36] of the son and of the holy
[2:05:39] ghost and he told those disciples, take
[2:05:42] this to the whole
[2:05:45] world. Never in the scriptures was
[2:05:47] anybody baptized in the titles of
[2:05:50] father, son, and holy ghost.
[2:05:54] They're titles.
[2:05:56] That's not the name.
[2:05:59] Sister Connie was as born a Frasier, but
[2:06:03] she took on my name as my bridegroom.
[2:06:07] And that's what we're doing here today.
[2:06:09] We're taking on his name. It gives you
[2:06:14] check writing ability
[2:06:18] and you sign Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:06:22] and today we stand here to do this. And
[2:06:26] on the day of Pentecost, Peter stood up
[2:06:29] and he began to preach. And if you'll
[2:06:31] time yourself when you're reading
[2:06:34] that, it's it's about three minutes.
[2:06:38] Amen. And it shook the world.
[2:06:43] And he said, "Men and brethren, what
[2:06:45] shall we do to be saved?" And he said,
[2:06:48] "Repent."
[2:06:51] That doesn't give you a a check card to
[2:06:54] where that you go back and do the same
[2:06:56] over again. The old man dies.
[2:07:00] Truly dies to the old man. Habits,
[2:07:03] nature, all of that has to
[2:07:06] die. And God takes the desire of that
[2:07:10] out of you. And then he says,
[2:07:13] repent and be baptized. There's
[2:07:16] something for us to do. and be baptized
[2:07:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:07:23] Now, that's not all of it. Amen. And
[2:07:25] then God made us a promise that he will
[2:07:29] come and fill your life with the Holy
[2:07:33] Ghost.
[2:07:36] You say, "How will I know that?" Well,
[2:07:38] you'll just know
[2:07:40] cuz every one of our experiences will be
[2:07:42] different. Some will receive great
[2:07:45] gifts. Some will just feel a just a
[2:07:48] little wind to
[2:07:50] come. But listen, when you begin to
[2:07:53] watch him live on the inside of you,
[2:07:58] you come to situations that you would
[2:08:00] have did it a lot different, but when it
[2:08:03] comes
[2:08:05] again and you see God's working on the
[2:08:09] inside of me. And so today, we just
[2:08:13] invite him. Now, let me just say this to
[2:08:16] all of our younger believers. Amen.
[2:08:18] Whenever you feel the warm presence of
[2:08:20] the Holy Spirit come into your
[2:08:22] room. When you're alone and he comes
[2:08:26] near to you and you know that's God, I
[2:08:29] want you to just stop and take a moment
[2:08:31] and say,
[2:08:33] "Father, fill my heart with more of
[2:08:36] you."
[2:08:37] I don't care how old you get to be.
[2:08:41] You just stop and say,
[2:08:42] "Father, fill my heart with more of
[2:08:47] you." Amen. Isn't he wonderful to us?
[2:08:50] And amen. I'm so honored to to be able
[2:08:53] to stand here and and be with you today.
[2:08:56] And I'm so I'm so pleased of what God's
[2:08:59] going to do in your life. Amen. There's
[2:09:03] five of you that your father is
[2:09:06] Levi. Levi. Levi's children. Is that
[2:09:09] correct? Am I in it? Amen. Could you
[2:09:13] just raise your hand? Amen. Five of you.
[2:09:15] Hey, I wanted to God bless you.
[2:09:18] Congratulations for being here. Amen.
[2:09:22] Amen. Could we just take hands one with
[2:09:24] another now and I want to pray with
[2:09:29] you. Amen. Thank you, brother
[2:09:31] William.
[2:09:35] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let's pray
[2:09:39] together. And in this prayer, I want you
[2:09:42] to say, "Father, fill my life with your
[2:09:46] presence." As I'm baptized
[2:09:49] today and I'm taking the next step, I'm
[2:09:53] asking you to fill my heart.
[2:09:56] [Music]
[2:10:00] Father, I'm so honored to stand here
[2:10:03] with
[2:10:04] these ones to be
[2:10:06] [Music]
[2:10:08] baptized. I pray that you'd help them
[2:10:11] today. You brought them into this
[2:10:14] precious moment in
[2:10:17] life. And as they walk into this watery
[2:10:21] grave, God, you made them a
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:26] promise. You'll be buried in my name.
[2:10:29] I'll raise you
[2:10:30] up now. Lord
[2:10:33] Jesus, I ask you to touch their
[2:10:36] lives. Each and every one of
[2:10:39] individuals. Pray that you'd touch them
[2:10:41] today. Lord, we can't take a rapture
[2:10:44] till the last one comes in.
[2:10:48] Who knows that today we're seeing some
[2:10:51] of these last
[2:10:52] ones? I ask you to bless their
[2:10:55] lives. I ask you to help us to be the
[2:10:58] right kind of pastor to
[2:11:00] them. Lord, may they be better sons and
[2:11:03] daughters of
[2:11:05] God, better
[2:11:07] fathers,
[2:11:10] mothers. God, I pray that you touch them
[2:11:13] today.
[2:11:15] We invite your presence to fill their
[2:11:17] lives with the Holy Ghost. We pray.
[2:11:21] Amen. And
[2:11:23] amen. Amen. And amen. Is he ready? Okay.
[2:11:28] Amen. So, what we will do is we'll just
[2:11:31] form a line and brother Gabriel will
[2:11:33] help us here and we'll just go right in
[2:11:36] to be baptized. And you have your
[2:11:38] clothes with you and or towel. Okay.
[2:11:42] Yeah. Grab that. Amen. Anybody else?

[2:15:24] Andrew. Amen.
[2:15:37] Father, we come before you today under
[2:15:39] the commission of thy word. Father, you
[2:15:42] told us to take and to go and preach the
[2:15:44] gospel into all nations, teaching them
[2:15:46] to be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:15:48] Jesus Christ. Father, we realize, Lord
[2:15:51] God, the power of that name. It's the
[2:15:53] name where no other man could be saved
[2:15:55] but by the name of Jesus Christ. And
[2:15:57] Father, I pray Lord according to thy
[2:15:59] word as we baptize her in water that you
[2:16:02] would baptize her with the fire of the
[2:16:03] Holy Ghost. May you wash her and make
[2:16:06] her new according to thy word. We
[2:16:08] baptize sister Jenny in Jesus name.
[2:16:14] [Applause]
[2:17:12] [Music]
[2:18:09] Heavenly Father, we here in this watery
[2:18:11] grave today. Sister Naomi has come to
[2:18:14] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:18:15] Christ. And Father, it is according to
[2:18:18] thy commission, Father. Lord, she heard
[2:18:20] the word of the Lord as it's went
[2:18:21] across, Father, and it pricked her
[2:18:23] heart. Now, Father, I ask Lord,
[2:18:25] according to thy word, Lord, as you
[2:18:28] said, if we would repent and be baptized
[2:18:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[2:18:31] that we would receive the gift of the
[2:18:32] Holy Ghost. So, according to thy word, I
[2:18:35] baptize Sister Naomi in Jesus Christ's
[2:18:37] name.
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:19:29] Father, we come before you today, Lord.
[2:19:31] It's what a privilege it is, Lord, to be
[2:19:33] standing here in this water. for
[2:19:35] realizing that the angels of God are
[2:19:37] encamped about this place. Father, our
[2:19:39] sister Melinda has come today to take on
[2:19:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[2:19:43] it is no small thing, but we realize
[2:19:46] that she is wanting to make you her
[2:19:48] Lord. I pray God that you would come
[2:19:50] today as she's repented of her sins, has
[2:19:52] seen the working of the Holy Ghost. I
[2:19:54] pray that you would come and minister to
[2:19:56] her according to thy word. Father, I
[2:19:58] baptize Sister Melinda in the name of
[2:20:00] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:20:04] [Applause]
[2:20:25] Jesus.
[2:20:41] Lord Jesus, we realize the sincerity of
[2:20:44] the moment that we're standing in,
[2:20:46] Father. Lord, this moment that you have
[2:20:48] predestined in time, Lord, we have
[2:20:50] watched, God, how that you've went
[2:20:52] through the course of time, Lord, and
[2:20:53] you begin to go throughout the land and
[2:20:56] call your seed, Father, and begin to
[2:20:58] manifest, Lord Jesus, what that which
[2:21:00] you have deposited. And Lord, Steve has
[2:21:03] been having a stirring on the inside of
[2:21:05] his heart, Lord. And you've been
[2:21:06] working, Father. And I pray that the
[2:21:09] Holy Spirit, Lord, that has been moving
[2:21:11] over his life, Lord. You told us that if
[2:21:13] we would repent of our sins, every one
[2:21:16] of us, and be baptized in the name of
[2:21:18] the Lord Jesus Christ, that you would
[2:21:19] give us the gift of the Holy Ghost,
[2:21:21] Father. Lord, according to thy word,
[2:21:23] Father, we get ready today to baptize
[2:21:25] our brother Steve. I pray that you'd
[2:21:27] raise him up to walk in a newness of
[2:21:29] life. So according to that word, Father,
[2:21:31] I baptize our brother Steve in the name
[2:21:34] of Jesus Christ.
[2:21:39] [Applause]
[2:22:18] Lord Jesus.
[2:22:22] God, what an awesome moment that we're
[2:22:24] standing in where our sister Dorothy has
[2:22:27] come to take on the name of the Lord
[2:22:28] Jesus Christ. It is my great privilege
[2:22:31] to be standing in this water. Father,
[2:22:33] realizing that not only brother Allen
[2:22:35] and myself and sister Dorothy is
[2:22:37] standing here, but our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22:38] is near. We ask God today according to
[2:22:41] our sister's faith in your word. Father,
[2:22:44] she's repented of her sins, Lord Jesus.
[2:22:46] And she's come to take on your name to
[2:22:48] make you Lord over her life. Father, I
[2:22:50] pray that you would come and fill her
[2:22:52] with the Holy Ghost and wash her and
[2:22:53] make her new. Lord, according to thy
[2:22:55] word, we baptize her in the name of
[2:22:57] Jesus Christ. May you raise her up to
[2:22:59] walk in her newness of life. So, Sister
[2:23:01] Dorothy, we baptize you in Jesus
[2:23:03] Christ's name.
[2:23:07] [Applause]
[2:23:27] What's your name?
[2:23:41] Lord Jesus, Lord, you said in your word
[2:23:45] where two or three are gathered in my
[2:23:46] name, there you'd be in the midst.
[2:23:48] Father, we recognize, Lord, there's more
[2:23:50] than two or three in this place. Here in
[2:23:52] this water, Lord Jesus, we recognize
[2:23:54] there's more than three of us, God. But
[2:23:55] thy nearness of the Holy Spirit is here.
[2:23:57] Our sister Ariana, Father, has come to
[2:24:00] join the economy and the family of God
[2:24:02] today and to take on your name in
[2:24:04] baptism. Father, Lord, according to her
[2:24:07] faith, Lord Jesus. Lord, you you told us
[2:24:09] not to push away the children, but to
[2:24:11] let them come unto you, Father. Lord,
[2:24:13] according to thy word, Sister Ariana has
[2:24:15] been pricricked in her heart, Lord, and
[2:24:17] been quickened to the word of God to
[2:24:19] take on your name. She recognized that
[2:24:20] she was born a sinner and shaped in
[2:24:22] iniquity, Father. She stands here in
[2:24:24] this watery grave to take on your name.
[2:24:26] So according to thy word, I baptize
[2:24:29] sister Ariana in the name of the Lord
[2:24:31] Jesus Christ.
[2:24:34] [Applause]
[2:25:14] Lord
[2:25:15] Jesus, here's our sister Barbie standing
[2:25:18] before you, Lord
[2:25:19] God. She's been faithful to your word,
[2:25:22] Father, to come here, to stand here,
[2:25:24] Lord Jesus. She's recognized, Lord, she
[2:25:26] was wrong. She was born a sinner, Lord.
[2:25:29] She doesn't even know what she was doing
[2:25:31] when she was born into this world. But
[2:25:32] she come here, Father, according to the
[2:25:35] curse of Adam, we were all born in sin.
[2:25:38] But Lord Jesus, you come to give us a
[2:25:39] new life. Give us your spirit, Father,
[2:25:42] to walk according to thy word. You told
[2:25:45] us to go and to preach and to teach
[2:25:46] them, baptizing in the name of the
[2:25:48] Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Peter
[2:25:50] caught that revelation on the day of
[2:25:52] Pentecost and said, "Repent, every one
[2:25:54] of you, and be baptized in the name of
[2:25:55] the Lord Jesus Christ." So according to
[2:25:58] thy word, I baptize our sister Barbie in
[2:26:00] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:34] Heavenly
[2:26:35] Father, Lord, it's our privilege to
[2:26:37] stand here in this watery grave. We see
[2:26:40] Sister Annie has come here today to be a
[2:26:43] candidate for the Holy Ghost. Lord, she
[2:26:45] desires that you would be Lord over her
[2:26:47] life. And we invite you, Father, into
[2:26:50] her life just now. God, you said if we
[2:26:53] would repent, we would turn away from
[2:26:54] our selfish ways and our pride and our
[2:26:56] our doings, Father, and repent in your
[2:26:59] name. It's not just turning away, but
[2:27:01] it's the power of your name, Lord Jesus.
[2:27:04] We do it in your name. Be buried in your
[2:27:06] name that you would give us the baptism
[2:27:07] of the Holy Ghost. So, according to thy
[2:27:10] word, I baptize our sister in the name
[2:27:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:27:18] [Applause]
[2:28:11] Father God, we stand before you, Lord
[2:28:13] Jesus, in this sacred moment. Lord
[2:28:16] Jesus, we're reminded about a Mary that
[2:28:18] carried our Lord Jesus Christ. Yes. And
[2:28:21] Lord, our sister Mary has come today to
[2:28:22] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:28:24] Christ. and I ask God according to thy
[2:28:26] word. She's repented of her sins. She's
[2:28:30] made all her wrongs right according to
[2:28:31] thy word. Father, she doesn't have to
[2:28:33] stand before a man to make them right.
[2:28:35] The blood of Jesus Christ forgives her
[2:28:37] of her of all her wrongs. So, according
[2:28:39] to thy word, I baptize our sister Mary
[2:28:42] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:28:47] [Applause]
[2:29:35] Lord Jesus, we come to you today. Our
[2:29:38] sister Ruthie has come to take on the
[2:29:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And it's
[2:29:42] our honor to be standing here, Lord God.
[2:29:44] Lord, to to witness the power of the
[2:29:46] Holy Ghost that has worked over her
[2:29:48] life. Sister Ruthie has repented of her
[2:29:50] sins and she's asking that you would be
[2:29:53] Lord over her life. Lord, may you wrong
[2:29:57] every right, every right in her, every
[2:29:59] wrong in her life. May you make it
[2:30:01] right. Lord, may the blood of Jesus
[2:30:03] Christ wash over her father and make her
[2:30:05] new. and according to thy word. Father,
[2:30:07] I baptize our sister in the name of the
[2:30:10] Lord Jesus
[2:30:15] [Applause]
[2:30:28] Christ.
[2:30:38] Our family home enjoy saying this.
[2:31:00] Heavenly
[2:31:02] Father, God, what an honor it is to be
[2:31:04] standing with this little
[2:31:06] child. Lord, brother William Wilmer is
[2:31:08] here today to take on the name of the
[2:31:10] Lord Jesus Christ. And the prophet
[2:31:12] taught us, Lord, as soon as the spirit
[2:31:14] of the Lord begin to deal with their
[2:31:15] hearts, to welcome them in to be
[2:31:18] baptized. Father, we can see that you've
[2:31:20] been dealing with his heart, Father.
[2:31:22] Lord, may he may you take away all the
[2:31:25] nervousness over his life, Lord, and
[2:31:27] begin to wash him and make him new. Lord
[2:31:29] Jesus, we see God, today is a breaking
[2:31:32] of tradition, and it is a walking in
[2:31:35] under the message of the hour. And
[2:31:37] Father, I pray God that you would just
[2:31:39] come today in this watery grave as
[2:31:40] Brother Wilmer stands here to take on
[2:31:42] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:31:44] that you would fill him with the baptism
[2:31:46] of the Holy Ghost. So according to thy
[2:31:48] word, we baptize brother Wilmer in the
[2:31:50] name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
[2:31:54] [Applause]
[2:32:25] Lord Jesus, our brother Emanuel has come
[2:32:28] and he's witnessed the word of the
[2:32:31] Lord to repent and be baptized in the
[2:32:34] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[2:32:35] remission of his sins. God, according to
[2:32:38] your word, you will remit his sins in
[2:32:40] the blood of Jesus Christ. He doesn't
[2:32:42] have to pay for it, but simply the blood
[2:32:45] of Christ has already been shed for him.
[2:32:48] But God, he's come to make you Lord over
[2:32:50] his life. So according to thy word, I
[2:32:53] baptize our brother Emanuel in the name
[2:32:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:33:00] [Applause]
[2:33:34] Lord God, our brother John has come
[2:33:37] before you,
[2:33:38] Father. He has repented of his sins.
[2:33:42] He's been studying the word of God, and
[2:33:43] he's seen where he needs to take on the
[2:33:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Father,
[2:33:48] you've seen where you've brought him out
[2:33:50] of, Father, to walk in this way. Now,
[2:33:52] God, I pray, Lord, according to his
[2:33:54] faith in your word, that you would
[2:33:56] baptize him with the Holy Ghost. Now,
[2:33:59] Lord Jesus, you told us to go into all
[2:34:00] the world, and that we have done. So,
[2:34:03] here in Elton, Virginia, we baptize our
[2:34:05] brother John in the name of the Lord
[2:34:07] Jesus Christ.
[2:34:11] [Applause]
[2:34:45] Heavenly Father, we come before you
[2:34:47] again, Lord
[2:34:49] Jesus, we could stand here and do this
[2:34:51] all day long, Father, but thou saw every
[2:34:54] single one of these children. Lord,
[2:34:56] before they made that decision, Father,
[2:34:58] there was something stirring on their
[2:34:59] life. And our brother Alvin has been
[2:35:01] pricricked by the Holy Ghost to come and
[2:35:03] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:35:04] Christ. Now, he has done his part. Now
[2:35:07] God, we realize that you're going to do
[2:35:09] yours. Father, he's repented and now
[2:35:11] we're baptizing him in the name of the
[2:35:13] Lord. So God, I pray that you would fill
[2:35:15] him with your spirit according to thy
[2:35:17] word. We baptize our brother Alvin in
[2:35:19] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:35:24] [Applause]
[2:37:00] was not married.
[2:37:14] [Applause]
[2:37:23] We're full. We're full. All the people
[2:37:25] here at Full Gospel Lighthouse, we're
[2:37:26] going to help them in all
[2:37:28] ways. I wish I was that good-look when I
[2:37:36] was proud
[2:37:40] of that.
[2:37:44] Brothers,
[2:37:50] Father, I stand here, Lord Jesus,
[2:37:54] with a man of God named after the
[2:37:56] Apostle
[2:37:57] Stephen. Lord
[2:37:59] Jesus, here he is in this watery grave.
[2:38:03] God, he comes here to take on your name.
[2:38:05] Lord
[2:38:06] God, what an honor it is to be standing,
[2:38:09] Lord Jesus. I didn't get to stand with
[2:38:11] Paul and Stephen in those days, but I
[2:38:13] get to stand with the Stephen this day
[2:38:15] and recognize the power of the Holy
[2:38:17] Ghost is moving in his life to make him
[2:38:19] a witness of the Holy Ghost, oh God,
[2:38:21] wherever he might go. Lord Jesus, I pray
[2:38:24] that you'd fill him with power like
[2:38:26] never before. We've seen the witness of
[2:38:28] the Holy Ghost begin to work on him,
[2:38:30] come down to the altar and make things
[2:38:32] right with you, Lord Jesus. Now this
[2:38:34] decision, Father, we see it now on
[2:38:37] earth, but God, you saw this in heaven
[2:38:40] before the foundation of the world.
[2:38:42] According to thy word, I baptize our
[2:38:44] brother Stephen in the name of the Lord
[2:38:46] Jesus
[2:38:58] Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:39:30] Father, in your word, Lord Jesus, you
[2:39:32] said, "Suffer not the little children,
[2:39:34] but let them come unto me." Here, Lord
[2:39:36] Amos Jr. today is coming to take on the
[2:39:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord God,
[2:39:41] it might seem a little young to some
[2:39:43] people to take on the name of the Lord.
[2:39:44] But what a great honor it is as a young
[2:39:47] man to witness the Holy Ghost coming and
[2:39:50] dealing with his heart, Father.
[2:39:52] According to his decision to take on
[2:39:53] your name, Father, he's repented of his
[2:39:56] wrongs. He's made them right according
[2:39:58] to the blood of Jesus Christ. Now God, I
[2:40:00] pray that you would fill him with the
[2:40:02] Holy Ghost. So according to thy word, I
[2:40:04] baptize Brother Amos in the name of the
[2:40:06] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:40:10] [Applause]
[2:40:39] Lord God, today we have our brother
[2:40:41] Michael standing here in this watery
[2:40:43] grave to come to take on the precious
[2:40:45] name of Jesus Christ. Father, we realize
[2:40:49] Lord, the wind of the Holy Ghost begins
[2:40:51] to move, Father, across his life and
[2:40:53] begins to deal with him to make his
[2:40:55] wrongs right according to the blood of
[2:40:57] Jesus Christ. those things are
[2:40:59] completely over in his life. Though he
[2:41:02] may have been si shaped in sin, born in
[2:41:04] sin, shaped in iniquity, Father, the
[2:41:06] blood makes it right. I pray according
[2:41:08] to thy word as we baptize our brother
[2:41:10] Michael in the name of the Lord that you
[2:41:12] would come and feel him from the crown
[2:41:14] of his head to the soles of his feet. So
[2:41:16] according to that word, me and brother
[2:41:17] Al and baptize him in the name of Jesus
[2:41:20] Christ.
[2:41:24] [Applause]
[2:41:58] excited
[2:42:01] Levi. Lord Jesus, our brother Levi
[2:42:05] stands here in this water. God, come to
[2:42:08] take on the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:42:10] Christ. God, today is a great day,
[2:42:12] Father, for we recognize that if one
[2:42:14] sinner repents, that all the angels in
[2:42:17] heaven rejoice. God, in the presence of
[2:42:19] angels is rejoicing. We realize, Lord,
[2:42:22] there's saints on the other side that
[2:42:24] are rejoicing over this moment. Lord,
[2:42:26] the more one more seed, one more trial,
[2:42:29] one more. We're getting a little bit
[2:42:31] closer to the day that you change our
[2:42:33] bodies. Brother Levi has come to take on
[2:42:35] your name and join the kingdom of God.
[2:42:37] So, Father, as I baptize Brother Levi,
[2:42:40] may you fill him with the Holy Ghost,
[2:42:42] and according to thy word, we baptize
[2:42:44] him in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:42:51] [Applause]
[2:43:31] Lord
[2:43:31] Jesus, Lord, Brother David is standing
[2:43:34] here in this watery grave to come and
[2:43:36] take on the name of the Lord. God, we
[2:43:38] ask God according to your word, Lord, as
[2:43:41] we baptize him in this water. Lord, he
[2:43:43] would come here to take on your name.
[2:43:46] And Lord, he's repented of his wrongs.
[2:43:48] He's turned away from his his old ways,
[2:43:50] Father. You have dealt with him service
[2:43:53] after service, Father. And you have
[2:43:55] dealt with him to come and take on your
[2:43:57] name. And God, we fulfill your
[2:43:58] commission in this moment, Lord Jesus,
[2:44:00] to baptize our brother David. So,
[2:44:02] according to thy word, we baptize him in
[2:44:05] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
