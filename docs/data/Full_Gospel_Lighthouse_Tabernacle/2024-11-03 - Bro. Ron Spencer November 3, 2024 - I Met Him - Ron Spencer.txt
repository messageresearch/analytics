just share something with you I just pray I I just pray every week Lord give me one good day I I just ask him Lord give me one good day to where I don't ache or I don't feel rotten and you know I'm really thankful to have that one good day and so uh do you get that every week well some days are better than other days and so and so we just are thankful we have a couple of appointments this week and and we're we're just we're just thankful to have good doctors are watching over our us and taking care of us glad to have a great God that's watching over looking forward to having brother Wayne with us next weekend and so I I thought he was going to get a standing ovation when you an announced it last night and and so we love brother Wayne this message has produced some of the greatest speakers in the entire world and and you know he he's just a he's just a he calls himself a hillbilly and uh we were I I I'll just you got a few moments he gave me an extra hour last night I won't take it but uh and so anyway brother Wayne and myself we were we were down in Pigeon Forge and we was we was up in the up in the mountain somewhere and and we were I'm not I'm not Connie and so Connie shaking her head you know there's some things that public don't need to know so brother Wayne was just we were we were standing on a bridge looking down at the at the at the river below us and and there was a there was a ranger standing beside of us and he was standing there and he said brother Ron he said I want you to look look look what's going on here and uh he was just talking about he said uh how how that you could trap the beaver that's coming out he said there's a beaver working right there and so he said watch it watch it said he comes around the the bend just right there and he's working and he's coming down and said if we went just a little further down said we could we could find out where his Den's at and Ranger said I've learned some things standing here beside you he said well I'm just an old country boy and so and I when I hear Brother Wayne preaching and all of a sudden he'll just drop some of those little nuggets about about those things of life and where he grew up and I I just I I remember some of those days and uh when he first started preaching and and uh I marveled at his gift as he be as is a young man and he has a phenomenal photographic memory and so we just are we're just privileged to have him with us next weekend he was at brother Tom Rays last weekend and he's at home this weekend and now he's going to be with us and so we're just thankful that he would take out time of his schedule to be with us for a couple of days and I think Bethany and Isaac's going to be with us as well and so we thank the Lord for what he's done for her amen I was I was uh I was just thinking about when we come to service and we're just kind of looking for that special moment in a service and you know sometimes whether it's a convention or whether it's a regular service you're just going God would you just give me that moment amen when the girl sang that just a moment ago I thought that's that's so nice that's so special we were at brother Tim prz and and brother Tim was uh had us to speak on Saturday night and we had a prayer line and probably 400 people came through the prayer line and and uh you guys were there with me and I was standing in the prayer line and this was kind of an unusual occurrence but there was a sister a a a minister's wife that had a specific prayer request that she was praying for and she was so heavy with this prayer request and it was for her family and she she it became so overwhelming that she felt like if I could just reach out and grab my husband's jacket I I just like to get a special prayer I'd like to have a moment well I'm I'm probably 15t from her and I'm just I'm just praying one for another one for another another and and the Lord starts speaking in my ear go pray for Abigail and so I looked down the line and I couldn't get to her at that point and I prayed for a couple of more and I looked down the line and there was an opening and I just took off now Matthew was taking care of me and all of a sudden I'm gone and Abigail opened her eyes and I took her by the hand and I began to pray for her and I told her exactly what the what she was dealing with exactly what her prayer request was for she had a moment now here's what I believe that he's the same God today now I believe he's the same God that comes and touches our hearts in a special way and and uh let's stand to our feet this morning and thank you for letting me share those things and isn't he wonderful to us amen amen now this week I this week uh elections on a lot of people's minds and and uh no I won't tell you who to vote for but I do want you to go vote if you'll do that and well brother Ron have never voted well I I'd like for you to do that and so uh our American thing to do and and uh I don't have a right to tell you who to vote for that's that's that's you you and that's you and your pencil so you you do that and and uh pray before you do it but here's what I want to get to there's a greater election has already happened and we were elected before the foundation of the world and I'm thankful to God it wasn't lift left up to human beings to call me in you and and brother Shannon we are the Eternal thoughts of God and if we're the Eternal thoughts of God there is eternal plans that are involved here so that's some of the things that I want to look at this morning John Wesley would say it like like this give me 100 preachers who fear nothing but sin and desire nothing but God and I care not a straw whether they be clergymen or laymen sit alone will shake the gates of hell and set up a kingdom of heaven on the earth I believe I'm a part of that don't you you'll turn with me to Acts chapter 9 and verse one this morning everybody hear me okay amen amen good to be here ain't it amen Acts chapter 9 and verse one and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem I know he's just held the coat of Steven and watched him being slain and as he journeyed he came near to Damascus and suddenly there shined around about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou Lord Brother Ram said he saw the pillar of fire and he recognized that was him and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us it is hard for thee to kick against the PRS and he trembling and astonished said Lord what would they thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man and Saul arose up from the earth and when his eyes were open he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus and he was three days without sight and neither did he eat nor drink and there was a certain disciple of Damascus named ananas and to him said the Lord in a vision ananas and he said behold I am here Lord and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and inquiring the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus for behold he prayeth and he ha seen a vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight and ananas answered Lord now notice his response now Lord I have heard many by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem and hear that he hath author y from the chief priest to bind all that call on thy name but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and the Kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake amen maybe you have a need on your heart you just like say Lord remember me let's just pray Lord Jesus we all have a need from you this morning Lord we're thankful to be in your house and Lord uh Lord we are thankful for such a beautiful day Lord we ask you that you would minister to our hearts in a special way whether we're sitting in the front or all the way in the back no matter our age group whatever we are God we are important to you and I ask you that you'd speak to our hearts in a special way today thank you for what you did here last night and what we saw with our eyes and what we heard with our ears now we ask you to anoint our lips and anoint our hearts Lord whether we're the speaker or the hearer we ask you to speak to us in a special way we pray in Jesus Christ's name and we all say amen amen you can be seated amen amen a't he good to us amen sister Anne I'm glad you got a good report amen that's we were worried about some of those things and so amen God bless you isn't he good to us last week I finished with with brother Greg and AAL and uh we we were standing here we were just conversing backwards and forwards and and I was talking to him about the that seal and how that that inspector puts a seal on a cargo on that on that box car before before that that it's able to leave and you cannot nobody cannot remove that seal until it gets to its destination and so the inspector has looked over that box car and makes sure everything is packed and it's packed for the journey it can make it over the bumps and the humps and the different kinds of things things and it can make it over as that train is traveling and it you see if it's not packed right it'll go down the tracks and after a while it'll begin to shake apart that's the reason we must have the Seal of the Holy Ghost we got to make sure that everything is just packed exactly right brother manam said as a Christian we've got to do some unpacking we got to get rid of some things of the world and we got to get get rid of the unpacking but there's also some things that we've got to get exactly right he us a term like a like it would be in a warship as brother Andrew's talking last night in the warships they would fire those old cannons and those cannons would be chained down and they would move those cannons from one side of the ship to the other side of the ship and put the put the end of that Cannon out the hole and they would shoot it and that Cannon would Shake can literally shake the whole ship when they would fire it but if it wasn't tied down a loose cannon would do the ship as much damage as it would be the one that was firing and that's the reason tempers and Malice and lust and jealousies all of those things have to be brought under the control of the Holy Ghost and it takes more than just a learn Behavior or vowing a vow or I'm going to do better or turning over a new Leaf we need a supernatural experience an indwelling of the Holy Ghost is it is it needful it's your token you won't get on a plane without without a ticket you won't get on a train without a ticket and you can't make the Rapture without the baptism of the Holy Ghost will you have an emotional experience maybe maybe not one thing about it it'll cause emotion in your life it'll bring everything under under subjection to you and and and under subjection of the word of God and and and one of the evidences that you'll be able to say Amen to every word of God even when it's something that causes bitterness on the inside of you or something that you just love and enjoy there'll be parts of the word that's so difficult but let me just say just keep eating just keep eating it are you with me now now I i' just like to to just start out here brother Brandon preaches a sermon on things that are to be it is not just coming from a prophetic voice but it's also a prophetic sermon into which that these are future events now God reminds us in this sermon and I want to give you a couple of quotes as we would begin he reminds us of this the in this sermon that we just didn't start out here in this life your birth year 196 1 or 1977 or 1982 that that wasn't where you started but you started before the foundation of the world brother man said God in the beginning being the infinite God he is infinite and we're infinite we're finite his mind is so much greater and in our finite mind cannot understand his great infinite wisdom but therefore when he speaks anything it may be seem very strange to us to hear him say a certain thing in the scripture but it's it's got to happen and I believe that his words will never pass away therefore I believe that God knowing that we in our little finite mind could not interpret his great mind he interprets his own word he doesn't need any interpreter he in he interprets his own word by vindicating that word in its season now he comes to you and he says your birth here was pre-planned I guess you believe that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned he said did you know that your being here never originated just at a myth or a thought everything was pre-planned by God before the foundational world that that you would be here the infinite God knowed he said and to be infinite he had to know every flea that would ever be on the earth it's quite quite astounding he said how many times that it would bat its eye he said that's infinite and our little Minds cannot fathom what infinite means the infinite God he knowed all things notice these next words therefore there's nothing out of cater you know you and I struggle over things that that don't mean anything I have to be honest with you we struggle over things that don't mean anything everything that you in this life is perishing and we get so wrenched and tore all to pieces about temporal things and yes I I understand I I'm fighting a very difficult thing but listen in the great scheme of this I'll Stand in the eternities and all of this will mean nothing are you with me now now watch watch what he says he says now he begins to say it and he lays the foundation he said the only way that you can be a son and daughter of God he said because you have to be have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life and the only one form of eternal life and that's God's own life there to be a son of God you had to be with him always the gene of Life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God and now you're expressed after his own word has comeing you to light up this age you couldn't have lived in another age you were only to live in this age how important are you how important are you Autumn if the en if the enemy ever tells you you're not important you just remind him of this thought God thought of me before the foundation of the world before there was a sun before there were stars I was with God and if you look at this you will never be lost if you were with him then this isn't hanging over a mistake today or tomorrow I don't know if I can make it it didn't hanging over your feelings or even your opinions you were God's thought before the foundation of the world Eternal in his mind in Eternal in his nature now I can imagine ananas as he gets word he gets word that I have I want you to go and there a man named Saul of Tarsus and Saul of Tarsus I want you to go lay hands on him and he's going to receive his sight and he begins to respond back to him says Lord I have heard many things evil of this man this man's carrying papers to kill murder ma destroy families destroy churches for the cause of religion you're talking about a perplexed Place brother Chris can you imagine in his thoughts God you're leading me into a trap am I the next stepen Brother Ray I I can imagine his his temporal thoughts is this God or is this or is this just a whim that I'm on am I being led to a death trap but God said he's a chosen vessel he's a chosen vessel unto me he's going to speak before Kings he's going let me just say he's going to be the first church age messenger he's going to write much of the New Testament are you with me now but he didn't he didn't seem like he was that kind of a fell at this point they recognized him as a murderer but when God begins to tell them I want you to understand you're looking at that which is in temporary and I've got something that's eternal you ever have a friend want to talk to you about the good old times oh back in the good old days that's a nice smile brother Kenny them weren good days to start off with them were some really bad days days I don't even want to tell my children none about we were we were sitting at Brother alden's house and and we were sitting there and having supper Friday evening and and a story came to me when I was a young boy and brother Alden said it across the table he's known me all these years and he said I'd never I'd never heard that story I don't know if I've even told my boys that story but listen all of that's the temporary part I I would tell it now but I don't want none of our young people to do what I did it wasn't that bad I jumped out of a second story window into a huge into a huge Bush and the principal was there to collect me somebody dared me to do it and about that time I heard the Dare and my feet left the floor I thought I was going to get a pounding I literally thought I was going to get a pounding and the and the principal left me for quite a while and he came back in and he said I I went to this school and I've been the principal of the school and I have taught at this school and he told me how many many years it had been since he jumped out that same window now you know brother B say God spoke it and said let there be and he said and let there be an Eden and let there be beautiful flowers and let there be my son and in my own image and stand over there in the Garden of Eden and let his bride stand by his side he did all that by the spoken word of God what are me and you doing here we are here by the spoken word of God and I just kind of want to pull some of these thoughts together this church maybe many of you don't know the origin of of us as a people but our our pastor that was here brother Homer Frasier no doubt when he got called to preach there was a lot of people like an ananas he's anything but a preacher but God chose him as a vessel and it may have started out in a basement and it may have started out in a in a in a in a little bitty building that was that was a wreck type of building and then in a ran in a house and and you worked on that house and made a church out of it and now we sit on this beautiful Hill but God knew what he was doing God knew what he was doing this is more than just a church and if I can say it we're more than just a people we are the Eternal thoughts of God now I I I want to just grasp a couple of your thoughts here just for a moment when we think about God releasing seeds into the Earth at a certain time at a certain place in a certain position they've got a purpose that they're going to do maybe your purpose won't be some of these but I want to just mention some of the impact God releases John Wesley onto the Earth John Wesley 5 foot one will preach 88,000 sermons eight sermons a day I am not the one that calculated that I'm just Google that's a Google he was rocked and stoned and left for dead after many of his sermons some we preach a sermon and we walk out and I didn't I didn't land my sermon I I don't think it went past the pull pit and it fell listen John Wesley preached the word had no church to preach in at certain points of his ministry preached in the street and was hated by religious men and they would hated him so bad until they would throw stones on him trying to kill him and he would Shake himself after they were gone only to get up tomorrow and start preaching again his brother Charles was quite a songwriter and wrote wrote hundreds of songs for worship his mother would be the one that would write down much of of morning uh devotions for for John Wesley she's the one that wrote most of his devotional books and she was called the another a Methodist movement but it was nothing like the Methodist today Fanny Crosby she came into this life and not being able to see and you've heard her say it many times she wrote the song I shall know him I shall know him of all the songwriters of life and many have sold their gifts and obtain great things of life but Fanny Crosby refused to sell her gift and she would write the song pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry another released to the earth a man named Charles Finny in Rochester New York and he had such a presence that when he preached as a matter of fact he preached and he sounded like he was very nasally and so when he preached they would ask they would ask why do people come out to see him preach he's an ugly man he said well they don't come to see me they come to see Jesus but there was such an impact of his preaching such an anointing that would fall on the community till men would would give their they would drop their lunch boxes five miles away from where he was preaching and give their heart to God what an impact that he had to where in the city there was no crime to where that even the police officers didn't have nothing to do and they became the barber shop quartets he still remember today but that denomination is nothing like it was Buddy Robinson I've actually preached in in a couple of places where that buddy Robinson preached brother Brandon would call him Uncle Buddy Robinson he was a man that would travel over two million miles in his life he would have over a 100,000 conversions he would preach over 33,000 sermons but here's where I want to tell you it all started in a field that's right and he had such a desire to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost he knew I can't do this on my own I can't live this on my own I've got to have the holy ghost in my life and one day he got so desperate before God until he draw a circle on the ground and got in the middle of that Circle and said if you don't fill me with the Holy Ghost when you return you're going to find my bones amen I think sometimes we've got to get desperate before God Amen everybody okay amen God would not only show brother brandom a vision of heaven or beyond the curtain of time but he would show him a vision of Hell at 14 years old and uh the reason I want to drop this here is we're Eternal and I I've got a couple of notes that I want to give you afterward brother BR says now after the vision struck me I was so weak I'd lost all that blood I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity as many of you heard me tell this before and sinking into an endless eternity first I was going down through the clouds and through darkness and sinking down down down and the first thing you know I I got into the regions of the lost and in there I screamed and and I looked and there was just everything there was no Foundation to it and he said I could not stop falling can you imagine I can't even imagine a thought of that I could not stop falling for eternity looked like I was going to fall there was no stopping nowhere and then what a difference it was from the vision I had here not long ago of being in glory with the people in glory with the people the contrast but in this I was falling I screamed for my daddy of course just being a kid that's what what I would do I screamed for my daddy and my daddy wasn't there I scream for my mother somebody catch me and there was no mother there and I was just going and I screamed in to God and there was no God there there was nothing there after a while I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard that it was the awful feeling there is no way even a literal burning fire would have be a pleasure to the sight of what this was and those Visions has never been wrong and just one of the most horrible feelings that I ever had and I heard a noise sounding like some of of a haunted Affair and it when it was I looked coming and it was women and this green stuff and he said he said just could could just see their face and they had all this green stuff under their eyes and their eyes look like running back and and like women today paint their eyes and run back like that and and just their eyes and their face and they were going wooo and I screamed out oh God have mercy upon me have mercy upon me oh God where are you if you'll only let me go back and live I promise you I'll be a good boy and that's the only thing I could say God knows at the day of judgment he'll judge me for that statement that's what I said Lord let me go back and I promise you I'll be a good boy he relates it in countown and he says he said then I think of The Fifth Dimension as where the sinner dies and where he go goes I think that when a sinner dies he goes to a to this fourth dimension the first thing he cannot go to the presence of God because he is a sinner and his time is up here on Earth and there's a point I want to say his time is up on Earth and if I if I could type it to you it's like trying to sleep and you can't sleep and you're in a nightmare hideous things screaming listen I understand nightmares I understand nightmares because of what we fight sister Connie helps me many times during the night to come to myself and just to come to myself I cannot imagine living in a nightmare and I always think about in a nightmare no matter how bad it is I wake up and it's not real and it's not real here's what I want to drop right here if you're a sinner today you don't have to go there you don't have to go there if you're riding on the fence make a decision today while the spirit of God is drawing on you there's nothing let me preach there's nothing worth going to hell [Applause] for brother man said that's the state of the wicked dead he cannot go into the presence of God because he's a sinner and I want to say this to you I prayed much about reading this quote I prayed much about reading this quote this morning I was standing in my office and I was Lord you know I've got a lot of quotes I've got a lot of things but Lord are you sure you want me to drop that in and then it begin to deal with me can you imagine standing on the day of judgment brother brand would use a statement he said now the prostitute knows where she's going the drunkard he knows where he's going and we got have a lot of labels they know where they're going but can you imagine standing in the same line and have sit in brother brandom's Church sit in and watch the prophet of God where are all those people at where are they all at and then it come to the end and their life is over with and now they're standing in that line with drunkers and with all the able people what did you do I just didn't receive the word I just didn't receive the word I rejected the word how close can you be how close brother Ron but you're way off am I Jesus tells us of a rich young ruler that even Jesus loved him there will be people that you love so much but you as an individual cannot give them eternal life as much as you would want to God won't override your choice the Wicked dead he cannot go into the presence of God because he's a sinner he cannot return back to the Earth because his time's up he's caught between two things in this Fifth Dimension he's got a soul and it cannot go into the presence of God because it's not covered by the blood he's a sinner he cannot wake hisself up this is a powerful quote he cannot wake hisself up because his time is up on Earth and there is a tormented nightmare think of that now before you can enter a nightmare scream how many of us have have had nightmares it's just because we're told because the two consciouses are passing sub and first conscious and it catches between and that's a nightmare and when a sinner dies he's caught with his soul between Earth and Hell in a nightmare and there he stands I preached a sermon one time in a funeral it didn't have to be this way it didn't have to be this way there was a denominal preacher that preached right in front of me and he glossed everything up made it all pretty you know and afterwards he wanted to come back to the pull pit and he wanted to do it all over again and I preached the sermon it didn't have to be that way and he turned to me and said you would you didn't have to be so rough and I said one of us were telling the truth [Applause] you can't you can't dry in a you can't die in a drug addict stew you can't die in a moral condition in a horrible situation and inherit eternal life am let's just be honest you got to be born [Applause] again you got to be born again and I say this to you you don't have to go that way that's right but for a Believer here's where I want to drop this for a Believer this is as close to hell as we'll ever get [Applause] now brother brand would make this statement he says now he said those Eternal thoughts that are now manifested in flesh are the sons of God even as we are called we did not become Saved By The Rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborned because we were seed is the reason that we could be quickened in nonseed there's nothing to Quicken he said now hold this carefully in mind take this next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death the shed Blood Bought back his own he bought back the spoken seed bride notice these words my seed my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never were a pig or a dog turned into a sheep that's right you always were a sheep that is it it is it is impossible for every kind of Life produces the same kind and there is no change in species as we were in his thoughts of God and then expressed into flesh there had to come today when we hear his voice the word and hearing that voice became aware of our father calling us Dylan you always were a Son of God turn to your neighbor I always was Hallelujah we were sitting at the table the other day and you was telling me about your family was here and they moved here and they moved there and they moved from pensilvania and move maybe to Florida then to South Carolina then to up up here and all of that moving and all of that goings on and they were going backwards and forwards they didn't know that the job was to get you here all all of their moving their job was to get you here sister Nancy the first mother Church sitting over here listen went through a horrible childhood a horrible childhood a divorced family we don't know that but it was all in the plan of God because she had to be at a certain spot that a wild boy would chase her around to church and kiss her listen she came from God are you with me and her life deposited look looked like it was horrendous but in all that horrendous God had a plan listen that's no small thing sister Nancy that's no small things you'll stand as a pastor's wife throughout eternity you'll be recognized come on church let me just say this to you oh but I've had such a horrible past was you like Joseph so by his Brethren thrown into prison lied on all of his family hated him he just gave them a vision of the word of God amen and it was all in the plan of God he was in the plan of God in a dungeon he's here he was in the plan of God in so many of your temporal situations things that you wrestle with he's watched over you brother Doug and sister Chassidy I'm just going to they went through phases in their life and in one of their young phases they came and told me they're moving to Alaska they moved and I'm sure they had a lot of good experiences but I'm sure there was a lot of horrendous horrendous times brother Doug I I'll just share this with you and cuz it's in my notes I probably prayed for you more then than I prayed now cuz I knew you was a seat of God and I knew as a seat of God and I prayed for them I prayed for you when I look over and see you sitting in this church we've came a long way we can look back and we've came a long way but you and I will spend eternity together [Music] [Applause] Paul struck off of his horse and he knows that's the pillar of fire we were we were at a meeting sister Nancy was with you and I sister Connie we was at a meeting at Brother Ray Ericson's that's when they were in their old church sorry I can't preach like Andrew now but hope I can still get my point across but we were there with brother bcll I didn't know I didn't know the week before he had preached a sermon and then the the sermon he said I'd like to hear I'd like to hear a preacher really go in depth about how Paul met that Pillar of Fire and then he just moved on he moved on to his thoughts so we go to the we go and of course I didn't hear that sermon and I go I go to to Brother Ray Ericson's and I'm preaching a meeting and I'm going to speak Friday night and and Saturday night and brother bisc is going to preach Sunday morning and he's going to preach a sermon called staying in the field and it was a phenomenal sermon how that Rahab the only Redemption place that she had was in that field and she wouldn't just work there but she would own it and so I came out and it it was on a Saturday night and I came out and I began to preach on Paul meeting the pillar of Fire and and meeting God for himself and that's where I stayed the entire sermon and I noticed brother Bisal was just bubbling months later I'm on my treadmill listening to a sermon that he preached the weekend before and I realized that he's uttered those words across the pull pit and talking about he'd like to hear a preacher talk about that and here I come we're thousands of miles apart I'm preaching on a moment here today listen we may be standing here in a clock of time but we're really in an eternal moment and and here I am preaching and brother bisc is sitting there and just eating it up not knowing what he's desired the week before they don't make me nothing but it just lets us know that we're in a channel and Paul had Saul of Tarsus has just held a coat for stepen he has watched him saying that there he stands at the right hand he stands and rebukes the denomination for not realizing who Jesus Christ is he goes all the way from Abraham all the way through to tell them who Jesus really is and standing there before that determined Council and standing there with those people and here is the first church age messenger here's the guy that you're going to read the scriptures behind 14 books in the Bible that he's going to write under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and here is that preacher with Steven's coat in his hand listen he felt like he was doing the right thing he had set at the feet of G who had been there where Jesus was at and Jesus preached in g h him he had been there and he had seen phenomenal things and listen he was zealous for his church and this Jesus business he didn't he had only heard stories of it but he was so zealous for the word he felt like this was a cult and he was trying to put it out he was trying to destroy this Antichrist movement that he thought that they was but there's just something about God when you meet him I'm talking about when you meet him when it's not your mama or your daddy's or somebody else's influence but when you meet God it settles the sin question it settles every question in your life and then every devil in hell can come against you and it don't shake you [Applause] I want you to think of what a how God operates God lets Gale train the first church age messenger amen of all of the ins and outs of the church he lets him see the hypocrisy he lets him see the social inner workings of what that Pharisee system is amen God allows him to become their most outstanding student he looks like he's on his way to being even the high priest order he looks like everything's right in plan that is going to rise right to the top and then God by his eternal thought interrupts the plan aren't you glad that God interrupted your [Applause] plans you were riding to church in a horse and buggy and you thought it was the right thing to do and you saw The Good the Bad and the Ugly you wrote ours to church cold buggies difficult situations and for you thought everything was fine and then God just interrupted the plan Hallelujah and he'll shake your whole Community are you with me he's not de he's not delicate I heard I heard Andrew preach last night about the war he's not delicate about causing a war in your home a war in your family cuz the seed that is there is not a temporary seed sometimes you like to rub the kitty a little bit and get everything to settle back down God's got a bigger plan than some temporary [Applause] feeling you imagine God allowed Moses to be trained by Pharaoh the best schools the best Architects headed to be the next pharaoh and God interrupted the plan he understood the political system the social workings of the greatest army that there was the building of huge monuments brother Joy when God spoke to him he never told him when he was looking out the window the same window that Pharaoh looked out and he saw the children of God and Pharaoh saw slaves God just didn't happen to speak to him and said okay Moses of Egypt in a few days you're going to be homeless in a few days everybody that loves you is going to hate you sometimes when you hear the truth all of the sudden the truth drops into you and it's what you've been looking for all your life and you think everybody's going to love what I just got and then their World Turns Upside Down and you feel homeless you feel helpless you feel unloved god what have you done to me you just broke through the shell and realized I'm an eagle hallu [Applause] brother Brandon would use a term called Paul a prisoner now I must point out and ask you at this point what are you a prisoner to you you got a picture beside to our governor last night you stood just feet away from Donald Trump last night and I I'm sure that was quite a quite a moment but you're sitting with the most important people in the world those men if there isn't a supernatural change will stand in the line of the judgment you spent time you said with young child hung child last night and his wife and you you made the statements that he's not even he's in the wrong Pol he's in the wrong Arena a lot of good men go into politics and become rotten why you say that brother Ron brother brandom said it I think if I would ask you today what do you believe is the most famous president of the United States of America I think the majority of us would go Abraham Lincoln for those that have a different answer it's okay but do you know Abraham Lincoln was the most hated president that ever set in the United States of America Abraham lincol did not even take the train that they sent for him to come to the uni to Washington because he knew that there was 11 different assassination attempts that was going to happen on his life instead he went to New York and then came down and the pinkertons are the men that actually took care of him him to watch over him that he could live to get to Washington that's right and they tried to assassinate him over and over and over again while he was in the office now you think about that you think well brother Ron you're talking politics I'm I've got it way higher in politics now it wasn't it wasn't drunks that were trying to do it it wasn't harlots that were trying to do it it was the political systems that was trying to destroy him come on church yet he held himself true and he held himself firm in a world that was falling apart many people that you work with are prisoners if you and I could sit down for a little while you could tell me what prison life is about there's a lot of things that you disdained it and you hated it you absolutely hated it I'm just pointing you out I hope that's okay you hated it brother Shannon I'm going to say something very difficult here God had to allow him to go there to where he could talk to him sometimes God allows you to fall in the most difficult situations to where he can talk to you where he can get you alone to where he can have a burning bush experience or a road to Damascus experience exp erience and he has to close your eyes to the point till you're blind till you're begging for help can I borrow just a little bit more time here when Jesus was on the cross brother brandham asked brother bcll how many people died there that day he said three three died at Calvary he said no he said four died at Calvary four died and brother bisco said I was just blew away right he said I blew away he said I was just sunk in the religion and what I was taught and he said Jesus and Judas perished and two thieves perished and Jesus took one and Judas took one now I want to take that and go somewhere for just a few minutes where would you rather be if you're standing and and you're watching the scene it's obvious Judas has told sold out Jesus and he can't live with himself and here's two thieves that deserve to be there but there's a man speaking in tongues and he's performed for phenomenal Miracles but he's dying for me and you you can't see that but that's what he's doing and one is making fun of Jesus and the other one is rebuking the other Thief brother Denny he never heard a sermon he never saw a miracle but something on the inside of him Eternal something on the inside of them that was eternal said Lord remember me when you come into Paradise never heard a sermon never saw a miracle deserved to die and he spent all of his life he spent all of his life wasted had a horrible reputation he deserved to on this cross but something inside of him saw a man from another realm a king from another kingdom Lord the same way Paul would say Lord remember me I Jo On My Mind sister Rochelle this morning I don't know how to put all this together I'll just have to say this to you there were men on the ground making fun of him with all their cloaks of religion with their screams brother Steven going if you are the Son of God cast bring yourself down we'll follow you and they paid him a compliment brother Bram said but whether they live a minute or 20 years they're going to hell and I just read to you about what hell is a nightmare and they stepped from the dimension of making fun of the the one that could save them from that spot to that Dimension to where they can't wake themselves up and there's a man on the cross saiding remember me and he's done nothing worthy but he recognized who he was and Jesus turns and gives him eternal life and when there's no pharaoh and when there's no sports stars and when there's no politicians th'll be a thief standing in an eternal body he never heard a sermon and never saw a miracle Andrew am I getting where I need to get what about the religious people on the ground today what about them today they made fun of the prophet what about the believe the sign people I don't generally do this but where are they going to stand where are they going to stand all their letters and videos and criticisms you know it's not so much they call my name but they blasphemed on one even call brother brandom a gay man I going to tell you what hell's [Music] hot I better leave that alone how close how close you can come to eternal life how close how close we're being influenced from one dimension or another and here's where you got to be real careful because not only is God trying to influence you the enemy tries to influence you you can be a positive 100% Christian and yet get a around D doubting Thomas and walk away with questions in your mind to which you have to rebuke out of your own mind being a Believer I have walked out of meetings where phenomenal miracles happen listen I walked out of a meeting you just you just actually spoke at this place brother Chris and actually walked out of the meeting where a man had staged for cancer with weeks to live didn't know nothing about the message but was invited brought his daughters his family and and during the meeting I went back and prayed for that man and that man got totally 100% well went back and saw Miracle after Miracle after miracle that took place brought marriages together brought things together people receive the Holy Ghost standing in that same prayer line I walk out of the building and walk up to a woman that rebukes me and says only brother brandham can do those things and starts going off and going off what' you do brother Ron I felt sorry for her that's right cuz we just saw God no man can do those things no man can do those things but here's a woman catches a critical spirit in the meeting listen we're going to spend eternity somewhere brother Ron there's no eternal hell you'll think it's Eternal in 10 minutes amen that's true thank God there's an end to it thank God there's an end to it but you're eternally separated from God why you bringing this brother Ron let me just say you and I rubbed shoulders with very temporary beings amen if you ever heard anything in your life set very very attentive right now brother Andrew said wake up you're rubbing shoulders with a lot of people from another dimension amen that are headed for a nightmare that's where they're headed to don't let them influence you I want to say this to especially to our young people listen this is not our home this is not our home you guys live in beautiful homes you live in nice homes you live in peaceful homes listen there's people all over the world would give anything to be able to live in your homes homes that are peaceful that are caring that love one another homes that have food to eat have a bed to sleep on have your own personal room I'm preaching to you now I think sometimes we become a very unthankful people you need to thank God for what you have right now not dreams of what you're going to have what you have right [Applause] now I finish now I don't want us to take ever come to these services and take it for granted I don't want us to ever take it for granted sister Beth we sitting in Heavenly places in a very special way I think you understand that and God has watched over our lives to to bring us here and that's around the world I don't think everybody has to move here this message is all over the world and I think every church every God ordained church has an atmosphere in it that's and listen it's more than a man listen we don't come to feed on a man we come to feed on the Holy Ghost on the Christ the reveal word and and Andrew said something last night and in my notes and I'm going to go past it listen if all we saw was Wigan Brandon we missed the picture if all we saw was Homer Frasier or Ron Spencer or Andrew or Donnie Reagan or Tim pu if that's all we saw we missed the whole picture it's Christ it's him living on the inside of us there's some things that we have to weigh out Nathan and I've sat with you in private there's things that we have to weigh out what is more important temporary or Eternal brother Ron but I got a great big job yeah you do you're citizens of another kingdom and that's a great big job and it doesn't matter if you're the president of the United States of America or you're a janitor if you're a citizen of that Kingdom this one's not going to last long and I would say this to you
