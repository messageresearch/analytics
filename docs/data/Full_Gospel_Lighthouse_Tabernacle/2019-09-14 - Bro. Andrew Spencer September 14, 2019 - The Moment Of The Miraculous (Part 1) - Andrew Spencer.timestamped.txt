[4:11] grace upon our laughs and and we want to
[4:14] be praying for our pastor as he is there

[4:18] meetings that God would use him in a
[4:21] very special way they are asking for an
[4:25] old-fashioned revival to break out and
[4:28] so I pray as our pastor would speak
[4:30] tonight that God would use him as an
[4:33] instrument and speak through him and may
[4:36] such an outpouring of the Holy Ghost go
[4:38] to those meetings there that same Holy
[4:42] Ghost is here tonight that's so insane
[4:45] Holy Ghost is is needed for family there
[4:48] in Arkansas this this week we want to be
[4:51] remembering the Reynolds family they're
[4:54] from brother Mike prices Church a very
[4:56] fine family just a just a picture of
[4:59] God's grace and tragic accident that
[5:03] took their and their daughter 16 year
[5:05] old daughter Cherith Reynolds home this
[5:08] weekend her sister Chloe was in the car
[5:10] so we want to continue to pray for her
[5:13] last I heard that she was doing okay but
[5:16] we know that there's nothing that we
[5:18] can't even imagine that pain we can't
[5:21] imagine that pain eyes I as a father I
[5:24] cannot imagine that pain and so we want
[5:27] to ask that God would comfort their
[5:29] hearts he is the God of all comfort and
[5:32] the God of all peace and we just want
[5:34] that God to go by their way and minister
[5:37] to them and you never know when when

[5:43] brothers sent a quote this week brother
[5:44] Branham when he was preaching Garnett

[5:48] and the life he said when God he said
[5:51] when you're making a bouquet he said
[5:52] sometimes you don't take fully bloomed
[5:54] flowers sometimes you take buds and he
[5:57] was saying about Garnett peak that he
[5:59] took a bud this time he took a but this

[12:23] Matthew chapter 9 and verse 18 a man
[12:29] thank you musicians a man what a
[12:39] wonderful day to serve our Lord Jesus
[12:41] Christ amen
[12:44] tonight I'd like to speak to you on a
[12:50] thought maybe depending on how the Lord
[12:53] leads us this evening we speak to you
[12:56] this weekend on this Lord on the moment
[12:58] the moment of the miraculous the moment
[13:03] of the miraculous Matthew chapter 9 and
[13:05] verse 18 while he spake these things
[13:08] unto them behold there came a certain
[13:11] ruler and worshipped him saying my
[13:14] daughter is even now we would say this
[13:17] moment is even now this moment did but
[13:21] come and lay thy hand upon her and she
[13:24] shall live and Jesus arose and followed
[13:27] him and so did his disciples and behold
[13:31] a woman which was diseased with an issue
[13:34] of blood twelve years came behind him
[13:37] and touched the hem of His garment and
[13:40] she said within herself if I may be
[13:43] touch His garment I shall be made home
[13:46] but Jesus turned him about and when he
[13:50] saw her he said daughter be of good
[13:53] comfort thy faith had made the whole and
[13:56] the woman was made whole from that hour
[13:58] and when Jesus came into the ruler's
[14:01] house and saw the minstrels and the
[14:04] people making a noise he said unto them
[14:06] give place for the maid is not dead but
[14:11] sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn
[14:14] but when the people were put forth he
[14:17] went in and took her by the hand and the
[14:20] maid arose and the fame here of went
[14:22] abroad into all that land a man may God
[14:25] bless his word he may be seated in the
[14:28] presence of the Lord we're reading here
[14:31] out of the Gospel of st. Matthew
[14:34] and as we have read this evening we can
[14:38] read this in several different accounts
[14:41] reading of my Matthew over in Matthew
[14:44] chapter 9 and then also in March after
[14:46] file than Luke chapter 8
[14:48] usually when when you hear that reading
[14:51] it you will read it from mark chapter
[14:53] you're most acquainted with the the
[14:55] reading of mark chapter 5 and where
[14:59] Jesus walks in but here here the writer
[15:03] of Matthew he puts you as as you the
[15:06] reader he automatically puts you into a
[15:09] spot where you can where you can
[15:12] you can view from his point of view that
[15:15] here here the the daughter of the ruler
[15:19] was a now dead
[15:20] and so now you're automatically
[15:24] captivated by the writers were writing
[15:26] here that that Jarius his daughter
[15:30] however you say jar eyes or Jarius
[15:32] however you choose to say it but his
[15:35] daughter was his daughter was now dead
[15:37] at this moment and we are looking into a
[15:40] spot in in Jerez his life where where he
[15:44] is in a spot or a moment of agony and
[15:48] there's as we have read this evening
[15:50] there's many different moments that we
[15:52] have read over there's moments of agony
[15:54] there's there's moments of pain and
[15:56] moments of desperation and then there's
[15:59] when you look at the woman with the
[16:01] blood issue that there's a moment of
[16:02] perseverance a moment of desperation a
[16:05] moments of determination and then we see
[16:08] that there is a moment there's moments
[16:10] of the miraculous and that's where we
[16:13] want to deal with tonight on on the
[16:15] moment of the miraculous and we as sons
[16:18] and daughters of God and I trust that
[16:20] that is your that is your speech tonight
[16:22] that that is your testimony in your
[16:24] confession that you are a son of God and
[16:27] a daughter of God but there's been many
[16:29] times in your life that that you know
[16:32] that there are certain moments of
[16:34] miraculous that have taken place maybe
[16:37] nobody else understands your moment but
[16:40] you had that moment where you know that
[16:42] it was only you and God in the building
[16:44] and maybe
[16:45] maybe the building was filled with 500
[16:47] people but it was your moment you were
[16:49] living and you were having a conference
[16:51] with a living God and he was speaking
[16:53] directly to you and maybe you were
[16:55] pressing through a crowd of 500 just to
[16:58] get to the hem of his garment but but
[17:01] but yet you chose to reach out in that
[17:04] moment and touch the hem of His garment
[17:06] while he was passing by your faith reach
[17:10] out and touch him and we believe that
[17:12] the Bible tells us that he's the same
[17:14] yesterday today and forever and and if
[17:17] he is the same that means that we can
[17:19] reach out and touch him tonight maybe
[17:21] maybe we were not looking for him in the
[17:24] same form but we know that he's here
[17:26] because his word said that he would be
[17:28] here he told us that that he'd never
[17:30] leave us that he never forsake us and he
[17:33] would be even in us to the end of the
[17:35] world and I'd say that sometimes you
[17:38] know we come to church many times we
[17:40] come to church maybe sometimes it's out
[17:42] of tradition but I trust that's not your
[17:44] confession but you come out to church to
[17:48] draw strength from God you you come to
[17:50] church for because you have a need in
[17:52] your life you come to church because you
[17:54] recognize that you need to be free
[17:56] refilled with the have baptism of the
[17:58] Holy Ghost and you need you need to get
[18:01] filled up with the nutriment nutrients
[18:03] to to change this body and to to to put
[18:07] on this and to put on the body of him
[18:10] corruption you you come to church and
[18:12] you're looking for that moment of the
[18:14] miraculous I'd say there's some times
[18:17] that we go to the house of God and we
[18:19] feel like nobody I like nothing is
[18:22] coming by our way and sometimes we're
[18:24] expecting we come to church and we're
[18:26] expecting God to move and sometimes we
[18:29] come to church just because the rest of
[18:31] the family came to church but and you
[18:33] know sometimes we walk in the house of
[18:35] God and we walk right in and maybe maybe
[18:39] it's just like another service and maybe
[18:41] the song leaders going through the
[18:43] motions and you're sitting there yet
[18:45] you're clapping your hands and you're
[18:47] lifti you're lifting your hand
[18:49] and yet you're doing that and you're
[18:51] you're fighting through laodicea you you
[18:54] just came off the work week and you're
[18:56] battling in your mind just to get
[18:58] something out of service and maybe it
[19:01] look like he wasn't gonna have a
[19:03] breakthrough but all of a sudden there
[19:05] came a rushing mighty wind and in that
[19:08] moment it was like a miracle took place
[19:10] it was like nobody a you look around and
[19:14] nobody else has got their hands up or
[19:16] nobody else's screaming or nobody else
[19:18] is flapping their hands or nobody else
[19:20] is feeling what you're feeling but it
[19:23] was your moment I wonder if there's
[19:25] anybody in the house of God tonight
[19:27] that's ever had a moment like that that
[19:29] they that they realized that there was
[19:31] more than a man that was speaking to
[19:33] them there was more than a man that was
[19:36] operating there was more than a man that
[19:38] was using a microphone that was more
[19:40] than a man that was that was speaking to
[19:43] hearts I believe that that this has
[19:46] Christians these are the moments that we
[19:48] live for you know we don't always go
[19:52] around that we're not we're taught that
[19:54] a weak and adulterous generation seeks
[19:56] after silence but we're not here looking
[20:00] at seeking after miracles are asking
[20:02] after miracles but we know that God
[20:04] gives miracles we know that God is a
[20:07] miracle worker so we can look for
[20:10] miracles and you know another man would
[20:12] say he said many times you see people
[20:14] that's happy and rejoicing and full of
[20:17] the Spirit of God where divine healings
[20:19] and powers and wonders and miracles are
[20:21] performed then they say it's hypnotism
[20:24] they say it's this that or the other but
[20:26] if you'll recognize if you only read the
[20:29] Bible you'll see it's the Lord Jesus you
[20:32] just don't recognize him you just don't
[20:34] realize who it is how many times how
[20:38] many people have walked in here maybe
[20:39] you brought somebody in you're a
[20:41] witnessing to them and the very first
[20:43] time they walked into service and and we
[20:45] had one of those Holy Ghost breakout
[20:47] service where everybody was screaming
[20:49] and you were sitting there thinking oh
[20:51] my I invited them on the wrong night but
[20:54] you know God has a way of working
[20:55] everything out just perfectly
[20:58] you see you think you've got it in
[21:01] control where you've got these moments
[21:02] figured out well I'll invite them on
[21:04] Sunday night or Saturday night with a
[21:06] certain preachers preaching but you know
[21:08] God has the ability to take a vessel of
[21:11] God and go down a certain course and and
[21:15] speak directly to their address
[21:18] if anybody can believe that God can do
[21:21] that we certainly should be able to
[21:23] believe as as sons and daughters of God
[21:25] and believers of the message that God
[21:27] could take a human instrument and take
[21:30] him down a course and go to an address
[21:32] and call out names and call out diseases
[21:35] and call out sicknesses and tell what
[21:38] you are thinking this past week the
[21:40] Bible tells us that the Word of God is
[21:43] quick and it's discerning the faults are
[21:45] there in the intents of the heart
[21:47] now surely surely we ought to be able to
[21:50] believe that tonight after seeing the
[21:52] son of man manifesting himself time and
[21:55] time and time again but that was not
[21:57] only for brother branham's day that is
[22:00] still alive in the ministry today come
[22:05] on somebody you may play a tape and
[22:07] brother Branham may not call your name
[22:08] but if you're sitting under live
[22:10] ministry tonight I'd say that God if you
[22:13] pull on that gift of God tonight God is
[22:16] so able to take me off of my fault and
[22:19] come to your heart and you can have a
[22:22] moment of the miraculous
[22:30] now Webster gives us the definition of
[22:34] moment in that word moment is derived
[22:37] from the word momentum it signifies to
[22:40] move to rush to drive or fall suddenly
[22:43] which sense gives that of force the
[22:46] sense of an instant of time it is from
[22:49] falling or rushing the it also it means
[22:53] the an indivisible part of time that
[22:56] means it cannot be divided that moment
[22:58] cannot be divided
[23:00] it cannot be cut in two and the Bible
[23:03] tells us in first Corinthians in there
[23:05] first Corinthians 15 and 51 behold I
[23:08] show you a mystery we shall not all
[23:11] sleep but we shall all be changed in a
[23:14] moment that cannot be divided in a
[23:17] moment that cannot be cannot be tore
[23:20] apart in a moment in a twinkling of an
[23:23] eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[23:25] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[23:28] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[23:30] you talking about moments of miraculous
[23:34] there's been moments where we knew that
[23:36] the Son of Man was calling our name but
[23:38] on that resurrection morning in a moment
[23:41] in a twinkling of an eye he cannot be
[23:44] divided
[23:45] it cannot be tore apart in that moment
[23:48] the miraculous will take place and this
[23:50] body shall put only corruption that's
[23:55] the moment that we're living for as
[23:57] believers tonight the Muslim body I'm
[24:01] not looking for 2020 the next president
[24:04] I'm looking in 2019 for the king of
[24:07] kings and the Lord of lords to step
[24:09] forth in a moment may it be this moment
[24:14] may it be next moment whatever it may be
[24:17] let's be looking for the coming of the
[24:20] king a moment is a force it's an
[24:25] impulsive power it is the importance are
[24:28] in influence or effect we all as
[24:32] Christians have been a part of moments
[24:35] of the miraculous
[24:37] I was awoken earlier this week from from
[24:43] my sleep and when I came to myself at
[24:46] 4:15 on Tuesday morning
[24:48] I actually I awoke myself and I was
[24:53] speaking as if I was speaking to a
[24:56] congregation and I heard my voice
[24:58] speaking God is allowing certain things
[25:02] to happen in moments like these in
[25:05] seasons to bring about a healing and a
[25:08] miracle God has allowed certain things
[25:14] to transpire so that you come to this
[25:18] moment of the miraculous there's been
[25:21] certain things that have added up in
[25:23] your life that have brought you to this
[25:25] spot there's been things that have
[25:27] transpired maybe you went down dark
[25:29] roads or maybe you went through it went
[25:32] through dark trials or went through this
[25:34] that or the other but you see those
[25:36] moments were culminating for a
[25:39] breakthrough you know that there's been
[25:44] certain things and had have happened in
[25:46] your life that you simply cannot explain
[25:48] that you would have to say that was the
[25:50] Lord is that right yesterday evening
[25:55] mine brother Matthew had planned to go
[25:57] out to see sister Irene late late later
[26:00] in the evening but we just got in the
[26:02] truck and left and when we got there we
[26:05] pulled right in front of brother Seth
[26:08] that was sitting there having a kidney
[26:10] stone attack what put me there in that
[26:13] moment none other than Jesus Christ you
[26:17] think God doesn't care this is a mighty
[26:21] car this is a God who is the I am the
[26:24] God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob he
[26:27] wants to show up in your life for a
[26:29] moment of the miraculous hallelujah
[26:35] there are certain things that you can't
[26:37] explain there's certain things that you
[26:40] just know that that was a miracle now
[26:43] the Bible tells us in Hebrews 11 now
[26:45] faith is not faith will be
[26:47] but faith is it's a substance it's it's
[26:51] a reality faith is the substance of
[26:54] things hoped for the evidence of things
[26:57] not seen
[26:58] you see even when you don't see a
[27:01] miracle happening your faith is the
[27:03] substance your faith is the evidence
[27:06] that a miracle is taking place or our
[27:09] healing is transpiring in your life your
[27:11] faith tells you even when you don't feel
[27:14] like worshiping him your faith tells you
[27:17] to or submit God is worship is that
[27:22] right are we in a complete agreeance
[27:25] tonight that God is worship he is the
[27:27] object of worship even when you don't
[27:31] feel like worshiping him your faith
[27:33] tells you that there's power in
[27:35] worshipping God even when you don't see
[27:40] the promise your faith says there is a
[27:43] promise
[27:44] even when you don't feel like any like
[27:47] you've didn't any better your faith says
[27:49] you are getting better even when the
[27:53] doctor says the results ain't looking
[27:55] good when he says the cancer may be
[27:57] coming back whether your depression is
[27:59] going to stay there all of your life
[28:01] even when you don't see him working he's
[28:04] working faith is the evidence that the
[28:11] healing and the miracles on the way you
[28:14] remember you recall by the random as he
[28:16] is teaching them teaching us whole faith
[28:19] you'll hear him talk about you hear talk
[28:21] about seeing that white shirt he knows
[28:23] that it's a white shirt even though he
[28:25] don't see it he'll tell you you'll hear
[28:28] him talk about now I've got an old
[28:30] Barlow knife in my pocket here
[28:32] he said now he said I can't feel it I
[28:34] can't smell it I can't see it but I know
[28:36] that it's there he said now if I would
[28:39] have left it on if I would have left it
[28:41] on my dresser back there when I changed
[28:43] my clothes
[28:44] he said faith would put it in my pocket
[28:47] because God is able to do that when you
[28:50] believe him with all of your heart he
[28:53] said now I know that that chokes you but
[28:56] if you truly believe with all of your
[28:58] heart
[28:59] faith in God it'll put it in your pocket
[29:02] there's some times that there's
[29:05] absolutely no physical evidence for you
[29:08] to believe God there ain't a single
[29:11] evidence in the physical or the
[29:13] scientifical realm that we should
[29:15] worship daughter or believe in God but
[29:18] yet standing here is a people that
[29:21] choose to believe that there is a God
[29:24] and what's believing in you can't see
[29:30] God you can't feel God you can't touch
[29:33] God but something tells you that he's
[29:35] here what tells you that he's here it's
[29:38] not because I say he's here it's not
[29:40] because the song leader says he's here
[29:42] it's because his word said he's here in
[29:47] the God's Word is right or it's not
[29:49] I simply to take this I simply choose to
[29:53] take the absolute all the way whew back
[30:04] up Satan Romans 10 to 17 southern faith
[30:09] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[30:11] Word of God is that right brother
[30:17] Branham you hear brother Branham and
[30:20] said well people say I want to see a
[30:21] vision he said every time you open this
[30:24] book it's a vision to you do you believe
[30:30] that tonight I've heard people say well
[30:32] I heard God talk to me in a long time
[30:34] when's the last time you read your Bible
[30:38] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[30:41] the Word of God Paul says in first
[30:44] Corinthians two and four and my speech
[30:46] and my preaching was not with enticing
[30:48] words of man's wisdom but in
[30:51] demonstration of the Spirit and a power
[30:54] that your faith should not stand in the
[30:58] wisdom of men but in the power of God
[31:02] in the Dunamis of God that your faith
[31:05] should not rest in my intellects that
[31:08] your faith should not stand in my wisdom
[31:10] but your faith should stand in the power
[31:13] of God so Paul was telling us here that
[31:18] the power of God would attend the
[31:20] display of truth everywhere and would be
[31:24] a demonstration that would be
[31:25] irresistible that the power was not
[31:28] originated by man but the power was
[31:31] originated from glory this word Dunamis
[31:38] in the Greek he meant strength and power
[31:40] and ability it's the power of performing
[31:44] miracles Jesus would teach us in his
[31:48] prayer in Matthew chapter 6 and 13 when
[31:51] he was telling us how to pray he said
[31:54] lead us not into temptation but deliver
[31:57] us from evil for thine is the kingdom
[32:00] and the Dunamis and the glory for ever
[32:05] he may for thine is the kingdom and the
[32:11] dynamite that both Satan right out of
[32:15] your breath for thine is the kingdom and
[32:18] the power and the glory forever amen he
[32:22] is saying that all power in heaven and
[32:24] earth is given unto me but look in Luke
[32:28] chapter 10 in 19 he says behold I give
[32:31] unto you power I give you power to tread
[32:38] on serpents and scorpions and over all
[32:41] the power of the enemy and nothing shall
[32:44] by any means hurt you we know that all
[32:48] power is in him tonight and the power to
[32:51] perform miracles in him tonight but he
[32:54] says behold I give unto you power hello
[33:02] we are a people who have seen the mighty
[33:06] works of God we sing the demonstrations
[33:10] of the Holy Ghost and when miracles are
[33:13] performed or something is done
[33:15] it changes the people's hearts and their
[33:18] attitudes towards Christ but yet after
[33:23] all that we've seen after all that we've
[33:27] seen manifested in this day they're
[33:29] still unbelievers there is still a
[33:32] people who try to say that the days of
[33:35] miracles are past and I will agree with
[33:39] those unbelievers there pass through
[33:41] them because the promise was not unto
[33:45] unbelievers the promise was to believers
[33:48] it may be past for some people but as
[33:51] for me in my house I have seen him as a
[33:55] miracle worker you come to tell me that
[33:58] God doesn't do miracles you're too late
[34:01] he come to tell me that God don't heal
[34:04] no more too late he come to tell me that
[34:08] God can't provide from my financial
[34:10] needs you're too late
[34:12] you've come to tell me that God doesn't
[34:15] pour out his spirit no more you're too
[34:17] late
[34:18] you come to tell me they don't save no
[34:21] more too late when I see a mighty God
[34:25] working in this congregation moving in
[34:28] there young people rising an older
[34:30] generation that wants to worship God in
[34:33] spirit and in truth that tells me that a
[34:36] Living God is amongst the people too
[34:39] late Satan they say God don't do those
[34:49] things no more it's those who people
[34:52] excuse me not those pupils it's those
[34:56] people who won't let God into their
[34:59] heart
[35:02] maybe you're setting their skeptic or a
[35:05] critic tonight a disbeliever in this
[35:12] truth
[35:12] it's you or those kinds of people that
[35:16] will not allow God in their heart you
[35:20] here brother random say that if God
[35:22] could ever gain entrance to every heart
[35:25] in this place there not be one free will
[35:28] one amongst us I wonder if there be if
[35:33] there'd be one little bit of unbelief
[35:35] tonight if there would be one bit of
[35:37] unbelief tonight in your heart it's
[35:39] going to stop you from getting to the
[35:41] miraculous tonight one bit of doubt one
[35:44] bit of criticism one bit of skepticism
[35:47] will stop you from getting through the
[35:50] miraculous but your unbelief will never
[35:52] stop God it'll just stop you Alleluia
[35:59] you see you've got to do exactly like
[36:02] Jesus did when he walked into Jerry's
[36:04] his house he had to kick out all the
[36:06] unbelievers and you got to kick out all
[36:08] the unbelief before you can ever get to
[36:11] the miracle before you can ever see a
[36:14] miracle you've got to kick out all the
[36:16] unbelief you see a miracle is something
[36:23] that cannot be figured out by human mind
[36:26] how many is in here is saved tonight
[36:32] look around everybody take your town
[36:35] take a look around you're looking at
[36:39] miracles you believe me
[36:44] I'm quoting to you the message if you've
[36:48] ever saved it's a miracle you can't
[36:52] explain after all the things that you've
[36:55] done wrong and all the mistakes you made
[36:57] why God loves you but yet God loves you
[37:00] it's a paradox but yet it's true God so
[37:07] loved you that he came for you and died
[37:10] for you you're a miracle tonight raise
[37:13] your head confess it from your lips I'm
[37:16] a miracle divine healing and miracles is
[37:24] two different things
[37:25] you see healing is a process of time but
[37:28] a miracle is instantaneous it's
[37:30] spontaneous we don't seek after miracles
[37:33] we don't come here touch asking God for
[37:35] a miracle sometimes we realize that if
[37:37] God don't show up and God don't do a
[37:39] miracle then there's no hope but we
[37:42] don't come asking God for miracles God
[37:44] performs miracles here brother Branham
[37:50] as he's standing there in prayer lines
[37:51] and I'm just laying a foundation and
[37:53] this evening for the weekend he said the
[37:56] Lord is who we don't ask you to do
[37:59] miracles but we're asking you for an
[38:01] encouragement to know that God is gone
[38:04] miracles are not performed by the will
[38:07] of man it's by the will of God every
[38:10] time that you would hear a person or
[38:12] hear to hear somebody called out it's a
[38:15] miracle
[38:16] just like when you read over in the
[38:19] Bible when Jesus is walking and he sees
[38:21] Nathanael coming and he said and
[38:24] Israelite indeed in whom there is no
[38:25] guile and Nathanael said whence knowest
[38:28] thou me rabbi he said before Philip
[38:32] called me I saw you while you were
[38:34] sitting under the tree that was a
[38:36] miracle right there but the random would
[38:39] say now now he said it would he said it
[38:41] wouldn't take he wouldn't be a miracle
[38:43] if I would say to this person sitting
[38:45] here in the wheelchair you can rise up
[38:47] and be healed
[38:48] he said it would just be their faith
[38:50] acclimating
[38:52] ooh what the Lord says they will be
[38:54] taking God's Word and they would do what
[38:56] God's Word said but a miracle is when he
[39:00] searches all the way down when there's
[39:02] nothing and nobody else knows about but
[39:05] you and God then you know it's a miracle
[39:11] why should we ever doubt come on
[39:15] somebody we've got no reason to have
[39:18] excuses we've got no reason to doubt God
[39:21] for he has manifested himself amongst us
[39:25] is that right
[39:27] it's a miracle every time a vision
[39:30] happens and tells people what's wrong
[39:32] with them but it's a healing just like
[39:35] when Isaiah when he walked up there to
[39:38] haircut Adele Hezekiah to make make your
[39:41] life ready you're getting ready to die
[39:43] but Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
[39:46] and he left and he asked God for a
[39:49] little bit more time he said god of not
[39:52] they acted the gay the grave came
[39:54] pressure I need a little bit more time
[39:58] in life to brace you and the Prophet had
[40:01] to turn around and go back up to Isaiah
[40:04] and tell him that you will not die but
[40:07] you will live but yet it took Hezekiah
[40:10] three days to regain his strength again
[40:13] you see that was a healing not a miracle
[40:15] a miracle is an instant it's a moment
[40:23] and when Christ got a hold of your life
[40:25] it was a miracle you know the road that
[40:30] you were walking now you know the path
[40:32] that you were taking it was taking you
[40:34] down a path of destruction it was a
[40:36] miracle when he got ahold of your life
[40:39] you know sometimes there's times in life
[40:41] when you're looking for God and you're
[40:43] looking for God to do a miracle just
[40:45] like a woman with the blood ish she been
[40:47] dealing with this issue for 12 years she
[40:51] went to every physician that she could
[40:53] spend every drop drop of money that she
[40:56] could to make sure to fix this problem
[40:58] but her issues were never fixed people
[41:02] can run the psychiatrist
[41:04] but the psychiatrist and the
[41:06] psychologist will fix your issue you can
[41:09] run from church to church but it won't
[41:11] fix your issue you can run from posture
[41:15] to posture but it will fix her issue
[41:16] most of time the issues with you
[41:21] [Applause]
[41:23] hello-hello but here this woman was
[41:27] dealing with an issue that she battled
[41:30] for a long time
[41:31] how many times how many have been in
[41:34] here that you've dealt with certain
[41:35] things it's been issues in your life and
[41:43] when Jesus came by you didn't care who
[41:45] was around you you didn't care if
[41:48] anybody else wasn't lifting their hands
[41:50] or nobody else was trying to get to
[41:51] Jesus but you were doing your best to
[41:54] get to Jesus you see the woman with the
[41:57] blood issue was pressing she was
[42:00] determining she had a perseverance in
[42:02] her heart to get to Jesus you see she
[42:05] was looking for a miracle but when you
[42:07] look over in the book of John chapter 4
[42:09] when there's a woman coming down to a
[42:12] whale one day she was walking down with
[42:15] her waterpot but she had no idea who she
[42:18] was getting ready to meet she wasn't
[42:21] even looking for Jesus she wasn't even
[42:24] looking for Jesus but Jesus showed up
[42:30] there was some women in the Bible that
[42:33] were looking for Jesus and Jesus showed
[42:36] up there's some people that were not
[42:39] looking for Jesus but Jesus showed up
[42:41] whether you see him tonight
[42:43] he's here you may not have came
[42:48] expecting to see Jesus you may not even
[42:51] been wanting to see Jesus or had no idea
[42:53] that you see Jesus but when Jesus shows
[42:56] up he turns were passed around and
[43:00] points you to your future
[43:04] he said if you knew who you was talking
[43:07] to you - for me a drink tonight if you
[43:11] knew who was in this building you would
[43:13] come running to him she had no idea that
[43:18] a miracle was on her way she'd been with
[43:21] five men and the one she was living with
[43:23] but here was a miracle worker and with
[43:28] Jesus begin to tell her all of these
[43:31] things she said we're looking for that
[43:37] Messiah and he said the one you're
[43:39] looking for I am he and she dropped her
[43:43] past she dropped what she was digging
[43:46] with what she was digging down in the
[43:49] well for she dropped her past and she
[43:51] ran to her future and she ran into a
[43:55] city and I found this absolutely amazing
[43:57] that she ran into a city sounding of her
[44:01] miracle hello for gospel I house she was
[44:06] sounding off her miracle to a city who
[44:10] had watched her fall in despair who had
[44:12] watched her fall in prostitution
[44:14] she was sounding off her miracle come
[44:17] and see a man is this not the very
[44:20] Messiah was her sound matching her
[44:24] miracle I would say so if I could have a
[44:31] little more up here brother you've been
[44:34] standing in a vision you as Full Gospel
[44:37] Light House has been standing in a
[44:39] vision to be more sincere and as labor
[44:46] day meetings were transpiring whether
[44:48] Tim Pruitt took the pulpit and he
[44:50] started preaching about a Mamba snake
[44:53] and being more sincere for gospel
[44:57] lighthouse walked right into a vision
[44:59] for gospel lighthouse it's time that you
[45:03] start sounding off your victories and
[45:05] sounding off your miracles you've been
[45:08] asking for your sons let out come
[45:14] you're in the moment at the miraculous
[45:18] [Applause]
[45:22] hallelujah hallelujah Christ interrupted
[45:27] her normal it was just another day it
[45:34] was just the same oh well it was just
[45:37] the same old pot but when Jesus came he
[45:40] interrupted her normally I'd say there's
[45:45] some of your lives that need to be
[45:46] interrupted I'd say some there's some of
[45:49] our products that their lives need to be
[45:51] interrupted I'd say there's some of our
[45:54] lost loved ones that their normal needs
[45:56] to be interrupted I don't come too far
[46:01] my prayer life to give up now I've come
[46:06] too far my praise to go down to a lower
[46:08] level place
[46:09] I don't come too far my preaching to
[46:13] walk back matter of fact I'm not going
[46:16] back I'm not God there's nothing to go
[46:19] back to we are only marching forward
[46:23] Christian soldiers marching as to war
[46:28] let's let nothing hold us back if God
[46:34] commanded a blessing let's receive a
[46:36] blessing when Mary that was just a
[46:48] little girl stepped into the vision we
[46:53] see stepped into the vision she had just
[46:56] walked into her moment she was destined
[47:01] to this moment she was destined to bring
[47:05] forth the Messiah that God would use her
[47:09] womb as an incubator and she would bring
[47:12] for the son
[47:24] boo devil she walked into them ahead in
[47:28] that moment she walked right into it it
[47:32] was her moment when there was nobody
[47:35] else standing around it was her moment
[47:37] when there was nobody else to
[47:39] congratulate her it was her moment we
[47:41] know us know when there was no family
[47:43] when there was no where anybody else
[47:45] that could say that they were a virgin
[47:47] and that they had met an angel there was
[47:50] nobody else to prop her up but she was
[47:52] standing there in her moment of the
[47:55] miraculous come on somehow when there is
[48:00] nobody else in your school that said
[48:03] they had the baptism other Holy Ghost
[48:05] you stood there when nobody else wanted
[48:10] to do right you did right it was your
[48:14] moment you were destined to it there may
[48:17] not be nobody else that ever wants to
[48:19] bring forth or praise like you but bring
[48:21] forth for your breeze that may not be
[48:24] somebody else who wants to lift their
[48:26] hands and clap and say it man but lift
[48:29] your hands don't be afraid to sound off
[48:35] your miracles Mary walked right into the
[48:44] moment and the moment was bigger than
[48:49] she could imagine I wonder sometimes if
[48:52] we walk right into those moments and we
[48:54] don't realize the miracle in the miracle
[48:58] are you with me this evening when Jesus
[49:02] was troubled to get on to the other side
[49:05] of a sea because there was somebody that
[49:08] was over there that was needing a
[49:10] breakthrough they were needing a miracle
[49:13] when Jesus where when Satan swore that
[49:17] he would defeat Jesus but yet Jesus
[49:21] stepped forth in faith and put his foot
[49:23] upon the brow of that boy on the bow of
[49:26] that boat and he spoke peace to that
[49:28] storm because there was somebody on the
[49:30] other side of that seashore that
[49:33] deliverance and when Jesus showed up on
[49:36] the other side of that Shore and he
[49:39] walked out there and there came a man by
[49:41] the name of Legion that was bound by
[49:43] thousands of demons
[49:45] this was legions moment the moment that
[49:49] he'd been looking for
[49:50] he'd been trove to the graveyards been
[49:53] bound by chains bound by fear been
[49:56] violent beliefs
[49:57] he'd been tore apart he cut himself he
[50:00] had a good family good children but this
[50:02] moment was the moment that he'd been
[50:05] waiting for all of his life
[50:07] whoa he was more than a man that stood
[50:11] on the other side of that Shore when
[50:13] Jesus stepped off that boat I'd say
[50:15] every devil in Hale started running for
[50:18] cover brother Branham said that those
[50:21] demons would have never went out there
[50:23] if Legion wouldn't have pushed his way
[50:25] to get to Jesus Legion was not his name
[50:31] but this man's name maybe we could say
[50:34] his name was John maybe we could say his
[50:36] name and maybe he was Susie uh-oh or
[50:39] maybe maybe aunt you are out and on
[50:41] faith or Sarah but there was a man that
[50:44] needed to get to Jesus it was in this
[50:50] moment that the miraculous took place
[50:54] you find a man that was once bound by
[50:57] chains that was driven into a graveyard
[51:00] and in the next moment was sitting at
[51:03] Jesus's feet in his right mind
[51:06] completely dressed but yet you got
[51:10] people today that say they're Christians
[51:12] and they're undressing I'd say they have
[51:15] not had a conversation I had a moment of
[51:18] the miraculous with Jesus if you can
[51:21] undress and call yourself a Christian
[51:23] I'd say you never had your moment but
[51:26] I'd say if you did undressing and you
[51:29] had your moment and you started dressing
[51:31] like a Christian you've had your moment
[51:34] [Music]
[51:43] you remember the moment that he came and
[51:48] what nobody can talk to you out of that
[51:50] moment are you with me this evening hey
[51:54] nobody can talk you out of that moment
[51:56] when Jesus came the Bible tells us turn
[52:03] with me to John chapter 3 give me
[52:08] another another microphone I'm tired up
[52:11] here John chapter 3 and verse 1 and
[52:19] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[52:21] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same
[52:26] came to Jesus by night and said unto him
[52:29] rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[52:33] come from God for no man can do these
[52:37] miracles that thou doest except God be
[52:40] with him so here's a secret believer
[52:45] testifying that no man can do these
[52:48] miracles unless God is with him thank
[52:53] you can you hear me okay well praise the
[52:58] Lord
[52:58] I think the mystical sisters wrote a
[53:02] song there would be no wires in heaven
[53:07] but here Jesus turns he turns to
[53:11] Nicodemus and what what it's heard as
[53:18] Nicodemus is here as he's portraying
[53:21] this this this statement to Christ that
[53:24] we know that no man can do these things
[53:26] except God be with him but Jesus is
[53:29] approaching his first doctorate and
[53:31] jesus answered him and said unto Him
[53:34] verily verily I say under the except a
[53:36] man be born again he cannot see the
[53:39] kingdom of God he says here's Nicodemus
[53:42] saying now wait a minute
[53:43] wait a minute I'm telling you
[53:45] I'm bringing to you that we know that
[53:47] God is with you but you're telling me
[53:48] that I need to be born again or how can
[53:51] a man in their true is in his mother's
[53:53] womb the second time but jesus said you
[53:56] must be born from above you can't
[54:00] understand the teachings and the
[54:02] preachings of this message unless you
[54:05] are born again but you don't have to
[54:09] wait till tomorrow to understand you can
[54:11] receive understanding right now the
[54:14] Bible says is there any among you that
[54:16] like wisdom let him ask
[54:18] I believe that if you are truly born
[54:21] again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:23] that you will get an understanding of
[54:26] this message and who Jesus Christ is and
[54:30] I believe that if you are truly if
[54:33] there's somebody out in denominations
[54:35] there and I believe that God is still
[54:37] calling from those denominations do you
[54:39] believe that tonight that God is still
[54:41] calling and I believe that they if they
[54:44] are here and they are elected of God
[54:46] that they have to come out of those
[54:48] denominations and come to this message
[54:53] they might have a form of the baptism of
[54:56] the Holy Ghost but they don't have the
[54:58] person you see because before you can
[55:01] have the person you've got to have a
[55:03] restoration and this word is a complete
[55:06] restoration of the Word of God you don't
[55:12] have to wait til tomorrow night service
[55:14] or the next service to be healed maybe
[55:17] you're sitting here and you're designed
[55:19] to be healed tonight or design to be
[55:20] saved or designed to be delivered but
[55:23] you can be delivered right now why you
[55:26] while you're sitting here if you're
[55:28] desiring the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[55:30] believe that while the preaching of the
[55:31] word is going forth that you can receive
[55:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[55:36] Bible says in acts 10 and 44 that while
[55:38] Peter yet spoke these words the Holy
[55:41] Ghost fell on them I say that while the
[55:43] preaching of the word is going forth let
[55:46] him fall upon your life and change your
[55:49] thinking and may you have a moment of
[55:51] breakthrough
[55:54] but if you get healed tonight you aren't
[55:56] healed to you weren't healed tonight you
[55:59] were healed 2,000 years ago if you're
[56:01] delivered tonight you weren't delivered
[56:03] tonight you were delivered 2,000 years
[56:05] ago
[56:05] if you get saved and gets salvation you
[56:09] weren't saved just now you weren't saved
[56:11] at the altar 10 years ago you were safe
[56:14] 2,000 years ago when Jesus died for you
[56:19] at Calvary and every redemptive blessing
[56:22] that God has for you Jesus said at the
[56:24] cross it is finished and everything was
[56:28] done and paid for and Jesus came and
[56:31] took you out of the pawnshop God came
[56:36] and bought you God came and purchased
[56:39] you and took you out of the pawnshop and
[56:42] the moment that you accept your healing
[56:45] or your salvation if you're walking down
[56:47] the street wherever you are the moment
[56:50] you accept it that's when you're turned
[56:53] around and if God be with us
[56:56] then where is it all of his miracles
[56:58] 1961 he says how are you ever going to
[57:01] see a miracle until you become morning
[57:05] glory a miracle of God's grace to take
[57:08] an unbelieving doubter and fill him with
[57:10] the Holy Ghost
[57:11] jesus said except a man be born again he
[57:14] can't even see the kingdom of God if you
[57:17] want to see a miracle become one hello
[57:22] let God work on you for he first he's
[57:26] got some overhauling to do some
[57:28] different lenses to put over your eyes
[57:30] because you're blind dead in sin and
[57:33] trespasses spiritually blind double dead
[57:35] that's right God has to give you life
[57:37] put your eyes so that you can see and
[57:40] perform a miracle and make you a miracle
[57:43] and then you can care then you can see
[57:45] the miracle working God that's the first
[57:48] thing so if you want to see them here
[57:50] cool you got to become a miracle before
[57:55] you can see the miracle worker you got
[57:58] to become a miracle you remember when
[58:03] that man came to brother Branham that
[58:05] was a car salesman
[58:06] and he told him that his wife was a
[58:08] Christian but he didn't want nothing to
[58:11] do with it but one day while he was
[58:15] working as a car salesman he had sold a
[58:18] car to two to ladies and he said I begin
[58:21] to wonder he said now did I give that
[58:23] lady both set of keys to her car and he
[58:25] reached down in his pocket and when when
[58:27] he reached down in his pocket he pulled
[58:29] out a tag that had a question mark on it
[58:30] and on the other side it said where will
[58:33] you spend eternity and he threw that
[58:35] thing in the trashcan and he said
[58:37] something said to him that's got to be
[58:39] settled
[58:40] he wouldn't grab it and he read over it
[58:43] again and he threw it in the trashcan
[58:44] and he did it again and he said he got
[58:47] so nervous and it said kept saying to
[58:49] him now that's got to be settled he said
[58:52] there he said my wife he said we went to
[58:54] we went to brother billy graham's he won
[58:57] her brother billy graham's meetings and
[58:59] he said I was hunting after and he said
[59:01] I went there and Billy Graham said is
[59:03] there anybody here that would like to
[59:04] accept Christ as their personal Savior
[59:06] then raise your hand and accept him he
[59:09] said they took him into a room and asked
[59:11] him do you accept Christ as your
[59:13] personal Savior and he said I do he said
[59:15] but it wasn't over yet he said there
[59:17] were felt like there was still something
[59:19] that wasn't settled yet he said so I
[59:21] went down to the Methodists and he said
[59:23] the Methodists told me that you got to
[59:26] get happy and you got to get sanctified
[59:27] and you got a shout before it's all over
[59:30] he said I got happy I say it got
[59:32] sanctified and shouted he said but it
[59:34] felt like something still wasn't over he
[59:37] said then I went down to the Pentecostal
[59:39] group he said I went down there and I
[59:41] asked me have you smoked in tongues yet
[59:43] and he said no I haven't he said then
[59:45] then they told him so well it's not over
[59:47] so he went into a room and the power of
[59:49] God he prayed and the power of God fell
[59:51] on him and he began to speak in tongues
[59:53] but he said I felt like his if it wasn't
[59:56] over he said I went he said I made
[59:59] reconciliation for everything that I've
[1:00:01] done wrong he said I gave money to
[1:00:04] preachers I gave I sold cars and gave
[1:00:06] cars to the evangelists and done all
[1:00:08] these things made everything right I
[1:00:10] tried to pay reconciliation and brother
[1:00:12] Branham told him said that wasn't
[1:00:14] necessary because you can't pay your way
[1:00:18] into heaven
[1:00:20] you can't work your way into heaven
[1:00:23] grace has already provided a way for you
[1:00:25] into glory he said but then they told me
[1:00:31] that I must have crossed over a line and
[1:00:35] the only one that could help me was you
[1:00:37] brother Branham he said so I came all
[1:00:40] the way here to see you brother Branham
[1:00:42] brother Branham stopped him he said now
[1:00:44] he said what they told you was the truth
[1:00:46] but it wasn't all the truth he said you
[1:00:50] said that something's got to be settled
[1:00:53] and you couldn't get over that he said
[1:00:56] now you were going down a road this way
[1:00:58] and all at once you started back this
[1:01:00] way
[1:01:01] you didn't care for God and he started
[1:01:04] back hunting for him I said rights there
[1:01:07] is where you made your turn that's
[1:01:10] exactly what changed you right there and
[1:01:13] he said then I've had it all the time I
[1:01:16] said certainly he said oh praise be to
[1:01:19] God what he'd been hunting for where he
[1:01:22] thought that he could make a way or pay
[1:01:24] his way into Calvary he had all that
[1:01:27] time you've been trying to fix your own
[1:01:33] problems and trying to figure a way out
[1:01:35] all this time but when your heart turned
[1:01:38] for God that's when you got it that's
[1:01:47] when you made the turn it was in that
[1:01:50] moment when that little bitty sticker
[1:01:53] that a little bitty thing where will you
[1:01:56] spend eternity at that's where he made
[1:01:58] the turn you remember that moment that
[1:02:04] you started hunting after God God built
[1:02:09] you in such a way that you would hunt
[1:02:11] after him like there's a deep calling to
[1:02:15] the deep he built you for that moment he
[1:02:21] built you so that a miracle could take
[1:02:25] and transpire in your life
[1:02:31] you've been trying to dig your own way
[1:02:33] out but gods already made her way out he
[1:02:38] can say well I'm doing my best to run
[1:02:39] from God God's already found your hiding
[1:02:42] place
[1:02:43] they say hide-and-go-seek with God God's
[1:02:46] already in your hiding spot he's in your
[1:02:48] future he's in your mind surely if he's
[1:02:52] in your future he knows how to get rid
[1:02:53] of your past you were built for moments
[1:02:59] like these every person sitting here
[1:03:03] knows the moment that he turns you you
[1:03:09] see the Bible the Bible was never
[1:03:12] written to show us only what God had
[1:03:15] done in the past but the Bible was
[1:03:18] written to show us who God is and what
[1:03:21] he wants to do in every generation in
[1:03:23] every walk of life everywhere on earth
[1:03:26] God is wanting to so come and live in
[1:03:29] your life and take a hold of your life
[1:03:32] that you'll be a miracle for Christ
[1:03:37] you're not the only church that believes
[1:03:39] in miracles you're not the only people
[1:03:45] that call themselves message believers
[1:03:48] there's people that call themselves
[1:03:49] believers but yet they don't believe we
[1:03:54] preach divine healing because the Bible
[1:03:56] says so but there's also other
[1:03:57] denominations that preach divine healing
[1:03:59] there's people that preach that God is a
[1:04:02] performer of miracles but yet brother
[1:04:05] Branham would say that those people
[1:04:06] would scream out and say well look we've
[1:04:09] got all of these results we've got these
[1:04:12] results here we get results but yet the
[1:04:15] results never take them back to the word
[1:04:19] where is your results leading you
[1:04:22] tonight the impact of his holy spirit
[1:04:26] that led you to this moment where is it
[1:04:29] leading you are you still coming to
[1:04:33] church just for your mom or your daddy
[1:04:36] or are you really coming for God
[1:04:42] I'd say that if you're truly not coming
[1:04:45] for him you need to allow the moment to
[1:04:51] transpire don't waste another moment
[1:04:55] don't waste another breath may there be
[1:04:58] such a moment that transpires in your
[1:05:01] life that you know that he showed up
[1:05:04] that you know that he showed out it was
[1:05:09] legions moment it was Mary's moment it
[1:05:14] was all of the heroes of faith it was
[1:05:16] their moment but now it's your moment
[1:05:18] now it's your time somebody's gonna rise
[1:05:22] up and believe somebody's gonna rise up
[1:05:25] and say I know that I can I will I do
[1:05:29] believe
[1:05:30] would there be somebody in the house of
[1:05:32] God that said I will be one of those
[1:05:37] let's stand this evening to be continued
[1:06:01] in moments like these I see now I see
[1:06:13] two here
[1:06:18] in moments
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:49] or singing

[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:09:09] all mary did was act upon what is that's
[1:09:17] also did is take daughter is and the
[1:09:22] moment that you act upon god's word
[1:09:25] that's when the miracle happens when you
[1:09:30] begin to take a step or a leap of faith
[1:09:32] that's when America
[1:09:36] before she ever felt a kid speaking to
[1:09:40] testify
[1:09:48] it may not look like it but yet start
[1:09:52] confess
[1:09:54] it may not feel like it the you keep
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:06] I know it's only one because his word
[1:10:10] said
[1:10:16] who you choose to take God at His Word
[1:10:22] there's sometimes the God test your
[1:10:25] faith to really see if you believe
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:29] but God so wants to give you a testimony
[1:10:32] [Music]
[1:10:38] whatever you got to do shake this war
[1:10:42] may for gospel items have such a
[1:10:46] testimony
[1:10:47] that it'll rock the shake songs to cross
[1:10:50] Jesus sets her desire tonight the
