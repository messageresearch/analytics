We're we're thank brother Ron and brother Andrew for giving us an invitation to be here this weekend and be in fellowship with you again. And it's a blessing to have my wife with me as well, sister Myra. uh she she really enjoys coming to this part of your your world and the Shannondoa Valley is a beautiful place and &gt;&gt; we're just well you get to see it every day so maybe it's gets old to you don't notice it but we come in and it's just beautiful every time we're here and we're very thankful that we can see it well a few times in life in the millennium I'll come and visit you all when when we're over where we are and you're here but we bring greetings from our family.

Lord's been good to you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. But of the times and seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. But ye brethren, this is speaking about you, but ye brethren are not in darkness. Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; That that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light and the children of the day. We are not of the night nor of the darkness. Let's just ask the Lord to bless us tonight. Father, we we bow in your divine presence uh today, Lord, with thanksgiving in our hearts, Lord, for your grace and your mercy. Even Lord, coming through thanksgiving this week on Thursday, Lord, we have so much to be grateful for and thankful for. Above all, Lord, we thank you for eternal life that rests within our souls, Lord. We thank you for keeping us Lord in the way Lord bringing us safely. Father I pray Father for Brother Ron, Sister Connie, the ministers of this assembly, the deacons trustee, the leoty. Lord, may your grace Lord rest upon each and every one of them. Lord, you know, Father, what there is in their hearts, Lord. You know what need they would have, Lord, in their lives, Lord. I pray, Father, that you would take control of this service tonight, Lord. The little thoughts, Lord, that you've laid upon our heart, Lord. Give us clarity of thought, Father. May, Father, our voice, Lord, become one with yours, Lord. And if there would be anything, Lord, that would be said, Lord, would you stop us, Lord, so that we would only say what you would have us to say tonight, Lord? We completely yield our members onto you. We thank you, Father, for healing the sick, Lord. Be with those Lord that are distraught. Lord, may your grace rest on each one. We commit this service onto you now for the glory of God. Take control Lord of the speaker Lord as I would yield myself to you soul, body and spirit for the glory of Jesus Christ. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may have your seats tonight. Amen. Why don't you look at your neighbor and and let them know that God is in control. God is in control. God is in control. I'd like to speak for a few moments tonight on a thought um that I've been looking at at home prepared for this time. Brother Brandham in in many messages, he talks about very precisely about when a person would have a child or a baby and how that you make preparation for that child. We can look through the scripture and we can see the hand of God on generations that have gone before us. And we know that God is in complete control of what is ever transpiring. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that Satan can't touch a hair on your head without first getting permission from Almighty God. So no matter what you're going through, what you've come through, and what you may be about to go through, we know one thing that we can settle in our hearts is that God is in control, and God doesn't allow mistakes to transpire, but he knows each one. He knows exactly what what you would be dealing with at any given time. He's God &gt;&gt; and he knows all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. in in the book of Isaiah u and I just want to just lay these two scriptures prior to moving forward in our thought today and that is arise shine for thy light has come Isaiah 61-2 and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and then in Zechariah which are very familiar scriptures to each one of us but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night. But it shall come to pass that at evening time, it shall be light. &gt;&gt; From before the foundation of the world was ever laid, before there was a molecule, before there was an atom, anything was put in its place or a human heartbeat, God had thoughts and attributes that he wanted to express. &gt;&gt; He had a purpose and he had an internal eternal intention. God's not haphazard when the way he does things like some people maybe conduct their business affairs. But God is very precise in whatever he does and whatever he will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where you would be sitting tonight. &gt;&gt; He knew exactly what the thoughts would be. He knew every song that would be sung tonight. He knew every thought that would ever transpire because he's almighty God. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he makes a plan or he prepares to make a plan, everything is going according to his divine purpose. That's why brother Brandham could tell us even in invisible union that you're going to a wedding in the sky. In God's mind, it's already concluded. &gt;&gt; We're just we're just living out the revelation of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're coming through a time period maybe that is a lot of darkness upon people's lives and upon people's hearts and and the way they conduct their affairs. But the bride of Jesus Christ has got the light of the word. She's walking in step with a composer. She's standing according to the divine purpose of God. She's not moved from left to right. She's not she's not moved by winds of doctrine. She's standing very sure in this hour. Just as the North Star would stand sure, you're standing sure in this hour. And we can we can say that that it's only God's amazing grace to each and every one of us because God purposed to have a bride. &gt;&gt; And there's going to be nothing that Satan can do or he can say that's going to stop it. &gt;&gt; Uh he can try with all that's within him and try to move one way or another way. But I I just want to let you know is that God's eternal purpose will not go unattended. &gt;&gt; He's already attending to it. We're just part of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when he purposed, he he'd have a bride. He wants a bride that's going to reflect his nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants a bride that's redeemed by his blood. &gt;&gt; We really have nothing to do with it outside of a yielded vessel onto Almighty God. &gt;&gt; He wants a bride that is washed in the waters of the word. Amen. He wants a bride that's sealed by his spirit. &gt;&gt; Not just an anointing on the flesh, &gt;&gt; but he wants something that is going goes down deeper than that. You want something in the soul realm where where something that anchors to the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; That you know who you are in Christ. That you're unmovable in Christ. You stand assured in Christ. Amen. You have a revelation of who you are. You have a revelation of the word of Almighty God. God has been gracious to you to open your eyes to what's transpiring in the day we're living in. Therefore, we can say that we're not children of darkness, but we are the children of the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a purpose in your life. Amen. God, he will say, "I I have a people who will bear forth my name. I'll have a wife who shares my throne. I'll have a bride who walks in my image that's filled with my life." &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a reason. &gt;&gt; Amen. I was looking at that just a little thought at home a couple of days ago, how great our God is. Our God is so great that that that he could he filled all space and time, but yet he comes so small that he can live within your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're fulfilling our part of the role. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can look at it through scripture from Genesis through Revelation. The Bible is the unfolding of the great eternal purpose of Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the sranian church age, brother Brandham said the heart purpose, the eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing that was purpose was in himself. And being eternal was decreed before the foundation of the world. He said, "Watch carefully now and see this. Before there ever was ever a speck of stardust, before God was God, which is God is an object of adoration, and no one was there to worship him. So he was at that time only potentially God. And he was known only as eternal spirit. The bride. Amen. Let's say the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride. &gt;&gt; The bride was already in his mind. Yes, she was. She was existing in his thoughts. And what about those thoughts of God? They are eternal. Are they not? Amen. So we can say with assurance that we are children of the day that we are not children of the night. &gt;&gt; Amen. God had a plan. God had a purpose. God had you on his mind. He put your name in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. He took a picture of you in and put it in the file of predestination only for it to be fulfilled when we move to the marriage supper of the lamb. God is doing it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we wonder why am I going through what I'm going through and ra we should rather look at it. Lord I'm here to walk with you faithfully day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, moment by moment. I'm here to fulfill the purpose that you have for me in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God wants us to fulfill his word. He allows Satan to come after us. And that's what's that's that's Satan's job is try to disrupt things, but God won't let him to go any further. Amen. But make a way of escape for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm very thankful for God's program. when you when you realize you watch your children or you watch things transpire and you can sit back and see the handywork of almighty God. I I want to say church, we are a very blessed people in the hour that we're living in today. &gt;&gt; Other generations did not have the revelation that you have. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are privileged. &gt;&gt; I'd like to draw our attention to now just for a moment of time to Genesis 1:es 3 and 4. And we know it so well, many of us. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good and divided the light from the darkness. From the very beginning, God's word has always done one thing consistently. It separated. &gt;&gt; It separates and it draws a line of distinction. God divided the light from darkness. You read through Genesis chapter 1 and it said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water. Let it divide the waters from waters. God is moving things always into a certain position. &gt;&gt; Amen. God divides truth from error. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there is only one truth. &gt;&gt; But there is many errors. There's many blurred lines and thoughts of confusion that blur people's minds. Amen. God, he he divides right from wrong. &gt;&gt; There's still what is right. And what was right 20 years ago, 50 years ago, was still what was right for today. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. As we continue to go further on, everything starts to seemingly get watered down. But I want to encourage you, not for the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I probably have said this here many times, but we we are not under legalism in this hour. We are under the amazing grace of almighty God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And his grace is what keeps us from doing things that that's outside of his divine will. Amen. The Ephesian church age, they strayed from the truth by the fourth generation. But the bride of Christ will not, let's say, will not. &gt;&gt; Will not stray from the truth. But she will stand very steadfast in the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it is the hour of light and it's the hour of illumination. It's time, Amen, that we put on the full armor of God. It's time that we put have the full revelation of the word of God. Amen. And not compromise. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not a compromiser. &gt;&gt; He He What is right is still right and what was wrong is still wrong. &gt;&gt; Hope this okay tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Righteousness is still righteousness and unrighteousness still unrighteousness. It doesn't matter how you package it. It doesn't matter what label of the message you put on it. Unrighteousness is still unrighteous. &gt;&gt; God has never changed his mind. What Brother Brandham taught in the 50s and the 60s, Amen. is still good for me today. It is still good for us today. &gt;&gt; Amen. He He separates the bride from the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are a separated people. &gt;&gt; He separates life and death. When you look in scripture, he separated the wheat from the tears. &gt;&gt; Amen. He let them grow together and and we know this. We know the revelation behind it. But there came a time when the combine is doing the separating. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which is the angels of heaven. Amen. He separated the five wives and the five foolish virgins. &gt;&gt; Amen. He separated Abraham and Lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was one that had revelation. He saw he saw three people but it was Lord. &gt;&gt; Lot saw two people and it was Lords. Amen. There was a separation. And when he separated him, that's when the promise came. When we separate oursel from all unbelief, that's when the pro that's when that's when the promise comes. He separated church spiritual from church carnal. &gt;&gt; Amen. We could talk of many, many things. God's separating. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not a mixer. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a separator. Brother Brandham in the door in the door. He said there is a segregation. The bride of Christ is segregated from the rest of the churches. That's exactly right. Church natural and the church spiritual. Church carnal and the church of the world. It always has been. Jesus came to his own and his own received and not. But I like the next few words. But as many, let's say many tonight. &gt;&gt; As many as received him, what did he gave them? He gave them eternal life. And there's only one way you can receive him. That is if you are predestinated son and daughter of the living God without your name on the lamb's book of life. The Bible says you will be deceived in this hour. But if your name is on the lamb's book of life, amen, you can't even help it. You are just born for one purpose and that is to serve Almighty God. &gt;&gt; I think we can have a shout in the house tonight. Amen. God is in control of your life. Amen. He's in control. He's cutting away all carnality from us. He's taken away all unbelief from us. He's taken away all doubt from us. And it doesn't matter what the devil traps the devil has laid for us. God is in control of our life. Amen. The word which is Christ, it cuts between truth and error. Amen. It it takes away. It looks at faith and fear. It looks at light and darkness. And it it looks at a believer, make believer and unbeliever, but it it separates them. Amen. Truth is always, as brother Brandon would use the word an oddball that's threaded to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's something that tightens down tight. He said it's to draw out the bride from the world. Set it aside for something different. Yes, friends, we may be a nut to the things of the world, the people of the world, but we are only drawing out that which is threaded for this. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're threaded to the things of God, blessed are your eyes that can see and your ears that can hear. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can say that with assurance. &gt;&gt; But Genesis chapter 1, it was not just the beginning of creation, but it was the beginning of God's pattern of separation. I just want to look at that for a few moments of time. if you'll bear with me today. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. It was the first time that God said that it was good. &gt;&gt; He separated light from darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Before light could exist, life could exist on the earth, light had to appear because light reveals. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you walk in in and I've been in a cave one time in my life, and I have to be honest with you, I'm glad I I don't have a desire to to look into caves and and to &gt;&gt; explore caves. That's not my calling in life. I'm I'm really happy. I I've told Sister Mara, I'm glad I live in this generation where you can have lots of light bulbs and flick a switch and turn on the lights. &gt;&gt; I don't like dark at all. I remember sitting in the in standing in those caves because with when darkness you can't see nothing. You can't even see your hand in front of you. &gt;&gt; One little strike of a match and you can see the whole cave illuminated. And and I like that message brother Brandham said there's someone that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know there's only one person that can do that and that's our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. But it takes light to reveal. It takes light to bring order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; It takes light to drive out all darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Light is the atmosphere where God works within. &gt;&gt; He only works within light. It takes light to ripen fruit on the vine. And we can say in this hour that we're living in an age of maturity. Amen. God is not coming for a a girlfriend that's a just a young bride. Somebody asks, "How how old was I when I married Sister Mara?" We we'll leave that till after the service. &gt;&gt; But God God knows all things. He's not coming for someone that's immature. &gt;&gt; And the only way we could have maturity, and I just want to drop this in here at this point. The only way we can have maturity in this hour is through the revelation of the word of God for today. &gt;&gt; It's not the first poll that I'm interested in, although I thank God for it. second poll, but I'm interested in the third pull of of the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which brings into light full revelation that we have need of in order to have a body change. There's no other generation of time that has the privilege that you have and that I have in this hour except for ourselves because God has brought us the third pole or he's brought us the opening of the word. We no longer have a closed word, but we have an open word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what does an open word do? It brings light. What does light do? It reveals. It reveals every shortcoming in our life. It reveals everything that's not according to the word of God in our life. Amen. It's God's word that does it through the anointed ministry of the hour. Amen. God did not let the light and darkness blend together. No, he divided them. This shows that God never mixes truth and error. He never mixes righteousness or unrighteousness. The world is looking for mixers. &gt;&gt; People that want to mix everything into it. And I sometimes wonder sometimes even in our own ranks if there's not too many mixers &gt;&gt; wanting to bring in all kinds of things because the power of God doesn't move anymore. But I I still believe in the oldfashioned power of God. I still believe in the Holy Spirit moving. I still believe that the Holy Spirit can change lives. that can take care of addictions, that can take care of of things in your life. It doesn't matter what it is. Some people think, well, maybe we need something else in order to help our young people. I'll tell you what, our young people need, our middle-ag, our old people, we all need the same. We just need more of God, &gt;&gt; and we need the Holy Ghost in our life in the soul realm, and it'll take care of everything. The reason why they have to have programs in this hour is because there's no longer the moving of the Holy Spirit and conviction of the of the thing from the things that are wrong. &gt;&gt; It's because we've allowed mixing to come in instead of the pure word of God. But I want to declare today is that we believe in the true word of God. And the word of God is what takes care of every issue of every person at any time, anywhere, under any circumstance. Amen. It's God's word that does it. I say in this hour, let the flashlight of the word come on a person's life one moment. It'll change that person and their whole desires that they have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why the best the best marriage counseling is coming to service and hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Somebody help me tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. People want to have somebody sit down and counsel and counsel. I'll tell you what we need is we need more of God in our lives to get rid of our stubborn spirits and our and our difficult times that we have and put Christ back on the driver's seat again till you have love for one another. Amen. Is this okay tonight? I hope this okay. Amen. We need that in our lives. We don't need mixing in our lives. What we need is the word of God preaching the power and the demonstration that changes lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not a time for mixing. I I every I' I've read the Ephesian church age book o over and over again and I every time I come to the one spot in it, the first generation had the power of God. Second generation it dwindles. The third generation it dwindles. in the fourth generation. No vestage of light even compared to the first at all. I look at and say that's not going to be me. That's not going to be the church. And Amen. That's not going to be what what God's going to say about me. We're going to stand true to the word of God. Amen. And our children are going to hear the truth of the word of God. Not a watered down message, BUT THE TRUE MESSAGE of the hour that changes people's lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for mixers. God is looking for separation from the things of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. That we would be holy unto God. That's why the Bible is very clear in 2 Corinthians says, "Wherefore come out from among them, and be you separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. I'll be a father unto you. You shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord." Amen. God wants us to separate from all of our unbelief. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. A lot of times people have in their mind that separate from this person, that person. I look at if somebody wants to pull me into the world, I don't want to have any fellowship with that. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest with you. Amen. If they they just want to say, "Well, it doesn't matter this way or that way." I say, "Yeah, it matters. God God's word matters." &gt;&gt; Amen. If it was one word off in the beginning, then then Satan's going to look for a place to bring one word off in the end time. Amen. But the bride can't fail. And I I I'm so thankful for that. That's why I say in the beginning, God is in control because the bride of Jesus Christ cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She's going to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what the devil throws at us, there is going to be a bride. We believe we're part of that bride. And I and I believe that that we we're gonna walk off of the face of this earth one day. Amen. And there's no devil in hell going to stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's doing what he's doing. But I'll tell you what, God is doing what he's doing. And God is preparing. Amen. Satan is preparing for tribulation period, but we're preparing for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say that if you got anything in your heart at all, I don't know most of the people anymore, but if you got anything in your heart at all that's not in tune with the word of God, I recommend you before this service is out today. Let God take it out of your life. Amen. Don't go another day with it in your heart. Say, "Lord, I'm here tonight. Take whatever I need to take out of me. TAKE MY NATURE. LET DIE TO MYSELF AND LET CHRIST REIGN IN MYSELF." AMEN. LET JESUS be the Lord of all in my life. AMEN. MAY MY LIFE BE A WITNESS AND A LIGHT TO THOSE THAT CANNOT that do not that I would reflect Jesus Christ in this hour we're living in. Amen. It's not a time, amen, to pushing it off and PUSH IT OFF. I SAY IF YOU GOT SOMETHING, DEAL WITH IT. AMEN. Let the HOLY GHOST TAKE IT OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AMEN. SAY, LORD, HERE I AM TODAY. I'm I'm HERE TO TO LAY DOWN EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF YOURS. AMEN. I may not know you, but he knows what's in your life. AND HE KNOWS YOUR THOUGHTS IN HEAVEN. SPEAK LOUDER IN HEAVEN than what your words do on this earth. AMEN. SO I SAY, CHURCH, DO WHAT'S RIGHT IN THE hour we're living in. Commit your heart to the Lord. Don't let it go another day. &gt;&gt; Amen. I feel very impressed upon my heart. Amen. GOD WANTS US TO separate from the things of the world. Amen. Separate from our carnal nature. separate from just being a lukewarm church man or BE SOMEBODY THAT'S ON FIRE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. AMEN. LET THE FIRE FALL IS MY PRAYER. AMEN. STIR EVERY HEART AND EVERY PERSON. AMEN. UNDER THE UNCCTION OF THE WORD OF GOD TODAY. AMEN. We're not mixers in this hour, but we are CHILDREN OF THE LIGHT AND THE WORD OF GOD IS WHAT'S BURN SHOULD BE BURNING IN EVERY ONE OF OUR HEARTS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. It's all &gt;&gt; Amen. We need Christ. We need Brother Brandon the thinking man's filter. He said God has a filter. That's his word and it's a separator for it's a water a separation from sin. Amen. He said that's the thinking man or the holy man's taste. Amen. That's what we need in our life. We need that holy man's taste in our life. Those messages speak largely in the hour that we're living in today. &gt;&gt; Amen. God commanded the light to shine out of darkness and has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's God. &gt;&gt; And he's all light. &gt;&gt; Light in the scripture represents truth. &gt;&gt; We know the truth shall make you free. &gt;&gt; Light in the scripture means vindicated word or manifested word. Our lives become the living word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Light in scripture is revelation &gt;&gt; or it's an unveiling. Amen. You can you can take a car and and I like cars and you can have a car something that somebody made from some whatever company and they want to make it kind of a display to the world and they'll put it underneath a veil or underneath a covering and you know that it's a car and you know something might know something about it but you don't know the color, you don't know the style, you don't know the engine, you don't know any of those parts about it. But when they pull the cover off of it then it reveals what is there. Amen. And God has revealed what we need for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no longer in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. If we look at Cain and Abel and maybe get ahead of myself here, but if we look at Cain and Abel, Abel offered by by revelation, which was light. &gt;&gt; God received his offering. Ca Cain offered by the workings of his own hand and God refused his offering. But the beautiful thing is is that God allowed Cain re room to repent &gt;&gt; and to offer the same sacrifice. It was Cain's decision not to repent. &gt;&gt; Amen. And offer the same sacrifice. When when brother Brandham was in Chicago at the ministerial association and when he was there that with all the ministers and they were going to try to trap him in his words and he stood up in the front of the people and and he said talked about water baptism. Show me in your Bibles where it's wrong and different doctrinal truths. Amen. Of the day. And many came to him and said that they were going to get rebaptized. They said, "We know it's the truth." But not one of them ever came. Amen. They had re room to repent, but they never repented of of their false doctrines. Amen. That's not so with the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wherever you come from, God has pulled you out. Amen. But he's here to put you into his word. Amen. And the word does not conform to us. We conform to the word of God in this hour. Amen. It transforms your life into a living image of Jesus Christ. Amen. Living upon the earth. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness represents human reasoning and it represents confusion and deception. &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness is all about reasoning. Amen. The same sun, that same rain that matures and ripens the grain also ripens the tears. Amen. The tears are being gathered. Amen. We could speak on that for the for the rest of the weekend. How the tears are being gathered together. We see what's happening in Christianom as known as the carnal Christianom of the world. They're gathering. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they're gathering to to their ideologies. And they're gathering to man-made confusion. And they're gathering to a trinity doctrine. and they're gathering to all of that. But the bride of Jesus Christ, praise the name of the Lord, she is gathering to the word in this hour. Amen. And she is not going to come up short. SHE'S GOING TO COME UP 100% ON THE MARK. AMEN. BECAUSE GOD IS THE ONE WATCHING OVER HIS OWN SEED. AMEN. HE DID NOT ENTRUST IT TO A MAN. AMEN. HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO STAND IN THE midst of the seven golden CANDLE STANDS. IT'S GOD WHO'S IN CONTROL OF IT ALL. AMEN. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A MAN. THIS IS ABOUT JESUS CHRIST IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. JESUS MANIFESTED AMONGST THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO'S PREACHING IT. IT'S ABOUT CHRIST BEING MADE REAL IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; It's all about Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's the one in control. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the light of the world. The rest is in darkness. in in the message in the message God turn on the light. Brother Brandham was speaks in here and he said the Jews thought they were worshiping in true light. Amen. But they thought they were worshiping the ve the same God that they were turning down the very one they thought they were worshiping. They were crucifying. They were making fun of the very God and making him a laughingstock of the people. The very God they thought they were worshiping. I I listened to a little clip of of a charismatic minister and and just recently they were talking about William Brham and they were talking about how in discernment it hit every time. It was perfect every time. But they said, "But when it came to the word, how far he was off." I listened to that and I thought, "My, you're so blind and you're leading the blind and you're you're all blinded to the things of life." And I just thought of it, how could it be true that God would hit every time and every prophecy was 100% and the be off on the word. That was only that catch the attention of the real believer. Amen. And the real believer saw that and said, "That's only God can do that." Amen. And you saw it and you SAW THE LIGHT AND SOMETHING QUICKENED IN YOUR HEART AND THAT SEEING OF GOD THAT WAS PREDESTINATED IN YOUR LIFE CAME ALIVE. AMEN. AND YOU CHANGED YOUR VERY DIRECTION OF LIFE. AMEN. BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. AMEN. GOD IS IN CONTROL OF EVERYTHING THAT'S TRANSPIRING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. We are PREPARED FOR THIS TIME, AND we're prepared for this hour. AMEN. IT'S NOT MY PREPARING, BUT IT'S GOD THAT HAS PREPARED IT, AND IT'S GOD THAT IS MAKING it come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandman continues down. He says, "But the hours at hand when the tr when the light is shining, the gospel light in his power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ manifesting himself that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever." Amen. He lauded that for this day. The things that he promised for this day must happen in this day. &gt;&gt; So we have a portion of the word they never had in other generations. And and they wish they would have saw what you can see. Amen. But the seals were close to them. The thunders were close to him. The mighty angel was close to him. The book of Revelation was closed to him. Amen. But you COULD SAY IN THIS HOUR THAT THE SEALS have been open in THIS HOUR. THE THUNDERS HAVE COME FORTH IN THIS HOUR. THE MIGHTY ANGEL CAME DOWN IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. AND GOD HAS OPENED HIS WORD. AMEN. TO THE BRIDE OF CHRIST. AMEN. NOT FOR ARGUMENT PURPOSES, BUT THAT OUR LIFE WOULD BECOME THE MERE IMAGE OF THE WORD OF GOD BECAUSE WE ARE BONE OF HIS BONE AND FLESH OF HIS FLESH AND AND SPIRIT OF HIS SPIRIT AND WORD OF HIS WORD. AMEN. When you SEE THE BRIDE, YOU SEE A REFLECTION OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. WHAT IS CHRIST LOOKING FOR? HE'S LOOKING FOR A BRIDE THAT REFLECTS HIS VERY IMAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; The things that happen must that he promised for this day must happen in this day. If the church won't accept it, God is able of these stones to rise up children onto Abraham. He'll get his message over because he's always done it and he always will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he goes further down. He said, "But they're traditions that separated them from the real light of the word." Amen. I would say I wouldn't want that to be on my resume. Amen. &gt;&gt; Traditions separating me from the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Traditions that we bring in with us that we have to lay down. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just refer to a couple scriptures. Psalms 119. The word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. The word is going to lead you. In St. John 8:12, I am the light of the world. He that followeth, he shall not walk in darkness, but he shall have light of life. In Ephesians 1, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened. In 1 John 1:5, I love this. Then this is the message we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. &gt;&gt; There's no darkness in God. &gt;&gt; There's no obscurity. God didn't do do things in a back room. He does everything very visible before the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. That no person can say we didn't know. They all know. Amen. But it's a choice. &gt;&gt; Their choice was to reject it and your choice was to receive it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From Genesis Revelations, God separates his own from the world. When we look at Noah, we can see that Noah was separated from a world that was under eminent judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's building an ark. I often think on year 90, year 110, year 118, he's preaching the same message. &gt;&gt; It's going to rain. They say, "No, come on. It's not going to rain. It's going to rain." And when he was when he was building his ark, he only built it for eight beds. &gt;&gt; There was an extra room on it. And the merry supper of the lamb has got exactly the right amount of chairs by &gt;&gt; Amen. And I always like to have a little plaque card when I sit down. I know where I'm supposed to sit because I'm looking forward and when I get to heaven, I'm going to look for my plaque card. &gt;&gt; Sister Mara, this is where we're sitting. Where are you sitting? We're sitting close to the bre brothers and sisters from Virginia, from Elkton. &gt;&gt; We're sitting together in marriage supper of the lamb. We're fellowshipping. [applause] The same light that changed us is the same light that changes us all. &gt;&gt; It's going to be a glorious time. Abraham was called out from his country. He was separated. &gt;&gt; Him and Lot were separated. Israel was separated from Egypt. And the Bible says in Exodus 11:7, "That you may know that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel." &gt;&gt; You put your name there. &gt;&gt; He puts a difference between church spiritual and church carnal. &gt;&gt; It's God that does that. The church, the bride is separated from the world. There's a distinction to the world and to the charismatic world and to the denominational world. We're we're strange people, but we are pilgrims and strangers. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're just coming through life. That's why the Bible says come out from among her. And I'm so thankful that I was able by the grace of God to come out from amongst &gt;&gt; the world as it were, the cosmos. &gt;&gt; Amen. and come into the revealed word of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. In in the Samarian church age, he says he says God had ordained that his people act different from the world. They are not of the world and they don't look like the world and they don't act like the world. They are crucified unto the world and the world is crucified unto them. He says, you see, one difference between Israel and the rest of the nations was God. Put God to one side and Israel was like any other nation. &gt;&gt; Amen. When God is brought out of the equation, then we are no different than any other people. &gt;&gt; Amen. I had my one of my uncles who was in a in a Pentecostal church in and for most of his life in in different different churches. He told me one time, Brother Robin was actually speaking. He came one Friday night. He's my dad's older brother. And he told me, he said, ' Kelly, he said, 'I want to tell you, he said, 'The spirit of God used to move in our church, but now it's only programs, &gt;&gt; and it's people putting together things in order to create hype in the church. Amen. The word of God doesn't need help. &gt;&gt; The word of God is the word of God. &gt;&gt; If it doesn't stir your heart, then I would look at your revelation because it should stir up your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it's your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. It becomes your everything. And I said, "God forbid that would ever happen." But then you hear all of the programming that we're doing is some of the people are doing and I'm thinking, my I don't want the world in the church. We need to push the world out of the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't we don't need programs. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't need something to whip the people up into into emotional atmosphere. What we need is the Holy Ghost. Let the Holy Ghost take control of it. Amen. He'll He'll get you dancing when you're supposed to dance and he'll get you shouting when you're supposed to shout. Amen. and he'll get you crying when you're supposed to cry. Amen. It's God that does that. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart. And I and I believe you can't put God on a box and say, "God, you can only move this little bit right over here because otherwise you're going to move outside of our tradition." I say, "Let God be God. Let God move like God wants to move." Amen. And let ourselves get out of the way that God can take full control. AMEN. BECAUSE LIGHT HAS COME IN THIS HOUR AND LIGHT HAS SHONE IN OUR HEARTS IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. AND THE WORD IN IS IMPRESSED UPON OUR LIVES and our hearts. &gt;&gt; It's not a dead letter. IT'S A LIVING REALITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE WORD IS CHRIST BEING REVEALED AMONGST THE PEOPLE OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. THAT THEY COULD REFLECT THE same imagery as what he is. &gt;&gt; I say thank God in this hour for light in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need light in the hour that we're living. It doesn't matter if you call yourself a Christian. Anybody can do that. That's brother Brandham. The point is whether or not you have the spirit of God in you. For without that spirit, you are reprobate and you're none of his. AND THAT'S A STARK REALITY OF A OF A QUOTATION THAT he would leave for us. Amen. But I don't put myself in the place of a repbate. I put myself in as an eagle in this hour. SPIRITFILLED, SPIRIT LIVED, SON AND DAUGHTER, DAUGHTER, SON OF THE LIVING GOD. AMEN. I'M ONE WITH HIM. HE'S ONE WITH ME. WE BECOME ONE IN THE HOUR that we're living in. Amen. When we and brother Brown said, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE WHAT THE RAPTURE IS, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE RAPTURE. I SAY, LORD, GET RID OF EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF YOU IN MY LIFE. AMEN. IN THE PEOPLE'S LIFE AND ALLOW CHRIST TO BE PREEMINENT AMONGST US ONE more time. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LET THE LORD MOVE IN ANY WAY HE wants to move. Amen. Let he let him JUST COME OVER THE PEOPLE. I feel like speaking in tongues right now. AMEN. LET HIM MOVE UP THAT LIKE IN A WAY HE'S NEVER MOVED BEFORE. &gt;&gt; And there's only one way that can happen IS WHEN WE GET RID OF EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT OF GOD. AMEN. PUT AWAY ALL THE THINGS OF THIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Have a conference with Almighty God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to be a called out church. I don't I don't want. Brother Brham says, "BUT THE PEOPLE WANTS MIXERS, BUT GOD CALLS her separators. Separate yourself from it. Yoke not up with unbelief." That's God's way of doing it. The world has a different conception. &gt;&gt; And I say in this hour, it's the truth. They have a different conception, but we have a conception as well. And that conception is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Kind of watching the time a little bit. I don't know when I even started. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got a lot on my fork. I'm just trying to see if I can bring it all to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The world today is in a spiritual eclipse. &gt;&gt; When light is rejected, darkness takes over. &gt;&gt; There's no longer a moral compass amongst the people. &gt;&gt; I don't know how it is in America, but in Canada, there's no morality anymore. &gt;&gt; The world's gone completely insane. &gt;&gt; Amen. Darkness is upon the people. They have ears that can hear and they have eyes that can naturally see, but they cannot see where they're going. Amen. Spiritually, they're brift. They're completely in in a state of chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew knew of a couple that that were in in a some type of modern church. And I know the know the couple quite well and and shacked up together and going to church and praising Jesus. And I say like, how in the world can you have that in in the church of the living God? Amen. There's no moral compass. &gt;&gt; They're looking for something that makes you feel good. &gt;&gt; But the bride is looking for something that that will help her to do what's right according to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's religious darkness upon the people. People professing light, but yet they're walking in darkness. False religion covers the true light through tradition, organization, and formality. And the results of that brings organization, programs, and psychology. Amen. Because when God is taken out of the picture, you have to resort to something else. And that something else is psychology, organization, and programs. But in the end time, in the end time, the same pattern, it repeats all the way through time. Organized religion rejects a revealed word and embraces ecumenical unity, which is a man-made light. And we see that happening in the hour that we're living in. Amen. Everybody wants to get along. And I say I get along with every person, but I there's one thing when it comes to the word of God, that's where I stand alone with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the word or it's nothing. &gt;&gt; But religion is a darkness. That's like a satanic camouflage. You know, you're all in hunting season here. And I I come and disrupt maybe some of your hunting time. But but it's hunting season for you all. And you put on your camel, what are you trying to do? You're trying to disguise yourself. But Satan's also got his own camouflage. Amen. He's got people that say they love Jesus, but their life don't even match up to one part of the word of God. Amen. We we we don't want camouflaged Christians. We want Christians who are born again, sons and daughters of the living God. Amen. Nothing to hide. There's when you when you take a covering that hides truth under a cloak of good works and unity. Amen. Brother Bram said they'll outwork us any day. But the Bible tells us that you give all your money to feed the poor, give your body to be burned, do all those things. But if you don't have God in your heart and your life, it is absolutely not even accounted by almighty God. Amen. What is he looking for? He's looking for a people who walk according to the light of their day and their hour. Amen. I'm thankful for Wesley's day. I'm thankful for Luther's day. Amen. I'm thankful for 1906, Zuza Street day. Amen. All of them were one stepping stone closer to what we have in this hour. But I'm very thankful for the light of the word of God for the day that we're living in. Amen. We're not walking in darkness. Amen. We're baptized according to Christian baptism. Amen. We don't act like THE WORLD. WE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE WORLD. WE'RE A SEPARATED PEOPLE. AMEN. WE ARE NOT THE CHURCH CARNAL, BUT WE ARE THE THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. SPIRITUAL CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, WALKING IN STEP WITH THE KING of Kings. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. One day we're going to be sitting with him in his throne. And what a grand time that's going to be. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And see does not air with the shock. Brother Bram says our modern denomination depend on education to some man-made theology to explain all things away. They accept it. They won't take the world that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. They won't take Malachi 4 and and won't take all of these other promises pertaining to this day and said how the churches how the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time. They don't take this. They want to hop around what some Pentecostal organization killed a 100 years ago eating on half half rotten matter. That's right. That's no good. Notice church is so carnal feeds itself on a worldly carry and dead things of the world just like the vulture does. church politics. They don't let the Holy Ghost send a man to a church. They'll have to have a politics and see if the denomination going to receive him or not. It's getting that way everywhere, church. Amen. And brother Bram said, "Do you ever see an eagle compromise?" He said, "No, sir. There is no compromise in him. Neither does a genuine Let's say, I'm a genuine Christian." &gt;&gt; Say it. I'm a genuine Christian. &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither does a genuine Christian. He ain't soft. He'll hunt till he finds it." Amen. Yes, sir. He'll find his meat. He wants fresh mana. He'll get down there and dig till he finds it. He'll fly higher and higher. If there's none in this valley, he'll just raise a little higher. And the higher you go, the more you can see. So, it's time for eagles of this day to get to flying higher. Dig into God's promise, not live on vulture food that's been killed years ago. Amen. And I say, WE DON'T WANT VULTURE FOOD. WE DON'T WANT THINGS FROM THE DAYS GONE BY. AMEN. WE CAN PREACH SANCTIFICATION ALL DAY LONG, BUT SANCTIFICATION MADE WAY FOR THE BAPTISM HIMSELF OF THE HOLY GHOST TO COME IN THE HEARTS AND LIVES OF the people. Amen. I say, LET THE LORD COME INTO EVERY life and every heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; true believer can't walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're still all together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. light separates them automatically. &gt;&gt; The bride is not deceived by denominational reasoning &gt;&gt; or worldly compromise. &gt;&gt; We know the Bible tells us there shall rise false Christs and false prophets and show great signs and wonders and so much it would deceive the very elect. But it is impossible. &gt;&gt; The very elect will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Cain represented the church without revelation. He worshiped. It was emotional. It was sincere. It was beautiful. But not according to the revealed word. &gt;&gt; God only will accept one thing. That's his own word. &gt;&gt; He built an altar. He offered sacrifices of his own hands. He bowed down in devotion. Yet re God rejected it because it lacked the revelation of the blood, &gt;&gt; the very life &gt;&gt; for their day. Lady Yosia boasts of religious wealth and success. And I heard those guys boasting, these charismatic guys. Oh yeah, my plane is worth 38 million. And &gt;&gt; I thought, yeah, your plane is worth 38 million, but what's that going to do to get you in the rapture? &gt;&gt; It might get you from point A to point B on the earth, but it's not going to certainly get you into the rapture. &gt;&gt; It's the wrong kind of rocket fuel. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the wrong stuff. Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't have what it takes to get through all the barriers of life. &gt;&gt; And go off into the eternities. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's lacking something. So they can have their planes. &gt;&gt; They can have their jets. They can have their Mercedes or what their fancy cars, whatever they have. Doesn't mean it's wrong to have one. &gt;&gt; But when they boast about it, Brother Brandham talked about it. I like one, too. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to get you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's going to give you a good ride from point A to point B. &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with a good ride. &gt;&gt; Help me, Jesus. [applause] The modern church, they offer their they offer music. &gt;&gt; They offer creeds and dogmas. &gt;&gt; They offer building programs and and excitement, but they reject the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Cain was very religious but rejected God's provided way. The same thing repeats in this age. Amen. It's a repeat of it. Cain's altar was beautiful but lifeless. Abel's altar was simple but it had living life that was taken on it. The difference between them was revelation but always find even in in St. Matthew 13, I believe, is when Jesus gave the parable of the seed, the swer. And the disciples asked him, why are you given everything in a parable? And he said, because it's been given to you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to them in parables, less seeing they could see, and hearing they could hear. Amen. That's why we can say, "Blessed are your eyes that can see, and your ears that can hear in this hour." Amen. &gt;&gt; In the rapture message, brother Ram said Cain and Abel didn't have a Bible to read, &gt;&gt; but it was revealed to Abel by faith, which is a revelation. Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain, which God testified that he was righteous. Amen. So in Eden, there was two worshippers. There was light and there was darkness. They were standing side by side, Cain and Abel, the church and the bride. And brother Bram said has been twins all the way from the beginning of time. &gt;&gt; It was twins then Cain and Abel. It was Jacob and Esau. Jesus and Judah. Now we have church carnal and church spiritual. &gt;&gt; Back to twins again. But the truth is still marching on. &gt;&gt; Amen. Both claim to serve God, but one was founded on reasoning and the other was founded on revelation. &gt;&gt; One reasons about the word and they can put everything in a certain order. The other one is by revelation. Amen. Reasoning can be changed, but revelation cannot be changed when it's anchored in a heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because it's true light. &gt;&gt; Abel's Cain's spirit lives on. Abel's spirit lives on in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Humble, blood wash, and spiritled. And this was a distinction of separation. The bride and the church at that time. Revelation versus reasoning. Abel's recognized God's plan and offered rightly. And the Bible recognized her day in its message. Brother Brandham the off and offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Amen. Recognition led to acceptance. When Abel rec received his revelation, he recognized God's provided way. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it changed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Noah recognized God's warning, he built an ark. That's right. &gt;&gt; Against all the common understanding of that day, he built an ark. &gt;&gt; When Abraham recognized Elohim in in human form, he received him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses recognized the voice from the burning bush. Who are you? He said, I am that I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is your name? I am. Amen. I want to say tonight, he's still the same I am. &gt;&gt; He's never changed. Amen. He's only revealed himself more and more and unveiled himself more until now. We can see the lovely one amongst us today. &gt;&gt; Peter recognized Jesus as the Christ. Paul recognized the pillar of fire. He said, "Who are you, Lord?" And the pillar of fire spoke back to him. He said, "I'm Jesus." Amen. Whom you persecute? Why do you kick against the pricks? In other words, I'm trying to move you forward, but you're not allowing me to. Amen. But he was chosen by God. Amen. If you're chosen by God, you're going to come the hard way, the easy way. any way at all, you're going to come because God is not going to lose one. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got that assurance in my heart. Sometimes we I've heard people talk about their children this or that. I said, "Look, it God did not give me serpent sea children. He gave me children." &gt;&gt; I I claim every one of them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And every one of them can't get in on my experience or on your experience. They have to have their own experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that experience has to change their lives like it changed your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or what we'll have is just a bunch of lukewarm Christians. But God is not coming for a lukewarm church. Come on, church. He's coming for a church that's on fire for God. AMEN. ONE WHO KNOWS HER POSITION IN THE WORD, WHO STANDS UPON THE WORD OF GOD. AMEN. THERE'S NO LUKEWARMNESS GOING IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD. AMEN. BLOODBOUGHT, HOLY GHOSTFILLED CHILDREN OF ALMIGHTY GOD. [cheering] It's gone. &gt;&gt; Is looking for his children. &gt;&gt; So people think, well, but my children I I I always give this testimony and I'll give it again. I my mom and dad are in a certain season of life. My mom's my dad's 89. My mom is 84. And and I can s I saw God work in their life. Amen. To the place where where they were looked like there was no hope for them. But God completely changed their life. My mom's only desire right now is to be in church. &gt;&gt; I say, "Well, that's a good desire. &gt;&gt; That's the best desire you can have." And we try to do whatever we can do to make try to get her into church. Amen. Because it encourages her. &gt;&gt; Amen. 10 years ago, it would not have been going to church. But now, God did something in her heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And such a thirst &gt;&gt; for the things of God. I was speaking to one of my younger brothers who doesn't serve the Lord. And he and he told me the other day on the phone, he said he said, "You know, Kelly," he said, "I don't know if you know I read my Bible." I said, "No, I didn't know that." He said, "Well, I do. I read it every day." He said, "How can I not read it?" I got on on my phone in three versions. So he started quoting me quoting me scripture and I was listening to him quote quote to me and I didn't have time to really talk to him at the time but I thought Lord give me the wisdom I have need of in order to draw him back into the into the things of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's 59 years old. He's been straight from God for for 40ome years. Amen. But it doesn't matter how long. &gt;&gt; Come on church. It don't matter how long. &gt;&gt; Amen. The promise is that when you pray you expect a result. I don't pray with it might be or might or a hope. So I pray that God is going to move on the scene. Amen. And touch their lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've seen it happen in my daughter's life. I've seen it happen in my my parents' life, my brother in Australia. They're still serving the Lord. Amen. I LOOK AT IT. GOD IS STILL GOD. AMEN. We just got to trust his word. AND AMEN. DON'T GET IN A HURRY WITH GOD. JUST BELIEVE IT AND LIVE A LIFE &gt;&gt; THAT SHINES THE GOSPEL LIGHT IN THIS HOUR. AMEN. There there's that song that where it talks about shining the gospel LIGHT AND I SAY LET IT SHINE IN THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. When you get revelation, it brings relationship between you and God. &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. This is an age of confusion and mixture. An age of mixture where light and darkness walk side by side where truth is where they want to blend truth with air and where people mistake noise for anointing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I just preach for a bit? &gt;&gt; Amen. That doesn't mean we don't have noise. I if I if I didn't have any noise in my church, I' I'd bury it. &gt;&gt; I I'll be honest with you. Brother Brandham, he talked about Saskatoon. Said we were mos backed. I said that's not going to be me. &gt;&gt; Come on. Nope. When I meet him on that day, I said, "Nope, that's not going to be me." I had a minister one time said, "Yeah, you guys are mossback. Your prophet says you guys got no no moving of God." I said, "No, that's not me. &gt;&gt; That's not me. &gt;&gt; Sorry, that's not me." &gt;&gt; Amen. You can you can hold that quote if you want to, but I said, "You better put it to somebody else cuz it's not me. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be our church." No. [applause and cheering] Because where the Lord is there there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I'm looking at it in relationship to the world and what the way they view it and the way they look at it. Some people look at it. Well, we have all this moving and so God's moving, but I look at what you're what's it producing in your life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not producing something in your life, I would forget about it. &gt;&gt; I would I would I would keep searching until something would change to the very inside of my inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And the message knoweth it not. Hope this okay. &gt;&gt; He said now don't forget this. You'll see the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost is people can live in the spirit. They can dance in the spirit. They can shout in the spirit. They go to church in the spirit and they can be absolutely with the real spirit of God anointing on that spirit but still be lost. And just as devil possessed as they can be without that spirit. Amen. With that spirit. Excuse me. And you say, "Well, Brother Kelly, where does that put us?" You you know what's in your own heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know sometimes people look at that and it's maybe goes a little bit different different than sometimes the way we look at things. But I look at I've seen people anointed by the spirit of God and they leave the church and they go smoking and drinking and whatever come back and have the same experience again. Something's not right with that life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That life needs to change. &gt;&gt; Amen. We We have a saying back home. You shouldn't jump any shout any higher than you're living. And I I say that's the truth. But if you're living really high, then shout real high. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let them let the anointing move upon you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's not you you can be anointed and still be wrong. And brother Bram was looking at a flesh anointing that had not changed the inside of a person's life. What are you talking about, brother? I'm talking about separating. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about separating unbelief from the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. take away all unbelief out of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I I believe if if all unbelief is gone, I say in respect to myself, there's no unbelief, then it doesn't matter. If I'm sick, he's my healer. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If I'm depressed, he's the my depression fixer. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I'm under, if I'm feeling down and out, he's the one that gives me joy in my step. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes we need to get our joy shoes on and put them on and just give the praise of God. Whether we feel like it or we don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because sometimes we don't feel like it. But I say whether you feel like it or not, give God the glory. Give him the praise. Amen. May there be a separation from our from unbelief to the things of God. Amen. He's a healer. He's a savior. He's a deliverer. He's our everything. AMEN. HE'S GOD IN THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip just skip a little bit here. The Jews were expect were expecting the Messiah, but their expectation blinded them to his coming. &gt;&gt; They expected a warrior. God sent a lamb. Amen. They were looking for a conquering king, not a sacrificial lamb. They expected a throne, but God brought the cross. They wanted deliverance from Rome back in their day, but God offered them deliverance from sin. Amen. And I believe that the church is looking for God to deliver the church from from all unbelief that would be hindering this moving of the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Churches today are expecting a world revival, but they've they've failed to realize the revival in the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is having her own revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. What is a revival? The revival isn't, Brother Bram said, is not necessarily putting in more numbers, he said, but it's taking what's in your life. Amen. And reviving it all over again. Amen. Where where the gospel doesn't become dead and and mundane to you, the gospel becomes living to you and alive to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's still the same living living word of God today is what it was the day that you got saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Churches are expecting, like I say, a world revival. I I I I watch I look at some of that stuff and there there's a big revival happening in our province over. They they had a prophet that told them to buy a certain land, then they got a revival. But you look at it and say, "What revival do they have?" There certainly is no word revival. Amen. But the bride is having a word revival. Amen. And it's not based upon emotion, but it's based upon knowing who you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an anchor to you. It's it's it's something that holds you within the veil. Amen. in Ephesians uh chapter 567 26-27 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with a washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish. I say that's for us for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. No other age had the had the responsibility of the word like we have it in this age. And the message that in the message Satan Zena and brother Aram said Eve was was tested on one word but we're tested on every word of God in this hour. Some people look at it. How are we going to make it? He's already made it for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You just got to stand according to the word of God. Amen. And when the light of the word strikes your heart, if there's something that's in your life, I say get it out of your heart as quick as you can get it out of out of your heart. Amen. The message of today is leading us into the rapture. &gt;&gt; People might think that there's going to be another message coming. I say it's too late for that. The message has come. Amen. Malachi 4 has come. &gt;&gt; There is no eighth church age. There is no eighth church age. Hope I'm not stepping out of line here. H church age messenger. There's none of those things. Those are man-made philosophies and doctrines. They are not the light of the word of God. There was seven stars in the hand of Jesus. There was seven candlestands. Amen. That he walked in. We are in the consummation of the gentile age. Amen. And light has come in this hour and it's shining brightly in this hour. Amen. And trying to get us to reflect the very image of JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. DON'T LET IT GO BY YOU. AMEN. ACCEPT IT IN THIS HOUR AND LET YOUR LIFE SHINE IN ALL THE GLORY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is a time when the mechanics and the dynamics are coming together and they're creating a force within your life. You say, "Brother Kelly, what force?" You can live above the things of this world in this Satan's Eden of this darkness and this dismal age we're living in. Amen. The devil and the and the world are underneath your feet. AMEN. AND YOU'RE STANDING ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD. THERE'S only one way you CAN DO IT IS BY THE LIGHT of the gospel of Jesus Christ. There's no other way in this hour for it to happen. It takes the light of the word. Mysteries that were hidden since the foundation of the world. THEY'VE BEEN REVEALED in the hour that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on, church. Amen. The hidden revelation of the seven seals are made known in the hour that we're living in. What for? Just for more material? No. to show us who Christ is in this hour. That we can see our image that we're to come to in this hour. I want to say in this hour, the bride is not trying to become the word. She is the word manifestation of this hour. Standing faithful to the word of God. &gt;&gt; The son of man ministry is Christ revealing himself through the word, not through man-made wisdom, but through vindicated revelation in this end time hour. Amen. As it was in Abraham's day, so it is today. Elohim came down discerning the very thoughts in Sarah Sarah's heart. So the same God has come again in this hour manifesting the world calling out his elect before the fire falls. Amen. The same pillar of fire that followed Israel is here again leading the bride to her rapture time to her resurrection time. The bride recognizes a voice of of the voice of the bridegroom and she moves on with that in this hour. I want to conclude here tonight with just this one one last thought in in recognizing the Danish ministry where and we're very familiar with this Danish and its message. Brother Bramson said Israel's back in the homeland and natural force put Israel in the homeland but the power of God will put the people in the bride. The world forces one way and this way and the world forces that way. But God forces upward. The spirit of God, which is the word of God, my word is spirit and life, will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word. Amen. And I emphasize that shield. Let's say that's me. &gt;&gt; Say it one more time. That's me. &gt;&gt; She'll recognize her position in the word. She's in Christ will put her in her place. Amen. No national force will do it. But the national force did drive Israel to the homeland. the national force, the council of churches will drive every organization into it. But the power of God, praise the name of the God, will rise the bride into glory out of it. He said, "Oh people, recognize your day as Jesus warned you. The sign of Sodom and the church's condition of this day." Look what he said in this day would take place. Listen to it real close. The sign of Sodom would take place in this day. Sign like Abraham that day before Sodom that was called out. All these things was prophesied will take place that will be taking place now. Watch the day you're living in. We've went over it. He said and he said he has promised to send you heavenly light to ripen the word seed that will be sown for this day. I want to say that he has sent his word and he has sent his light. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we are now moving on in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride will be identified. This is the feast of the trumpets. The bride will be identified in him. Any woman must be identified with her husband for the two are one. And Christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one. And he is the word, not the denomination, the word. We are to be the children of light. And the light is the word which has made light for this day. He continues on. Children of light, accept his word. Keep walking and watching more unfold. He said, don't leave it. No matter what somebody says, stay in that and just keep walking with it. walk, watch it unfold and reveal itself. The word is a seed and a seed is the right kind of ground that will bring forth its kind. And I say that it will bring forth of its kind. Amen. The light has shone in the brightly in this hour. Amen. There was a day that it was a little bit dismal, but now the light has shone in the evening time. I believe that we're part of the evening time people. We're walking in light in this hour as he's in the light. Amen. Not of a former age, but of the hour that we're living in in the hour of today. Amen. I say God bless you. Amen. And may the L spirit of the Lord continue to be with you. God bless you, Brother Andrew. [applause] Can we give the Lord a hand clap of praise tonight? [applause] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Kissy. See. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Before I spoke a word, you were singing over me. Oh, you have been so [music] so good to me.

Oh, I long for those [singing] moments when just you and I. [music] I get lost in your [singing] presence. We lose track of time. When [music] I'm overwhelmed, I go glorified. When I'm [singing] on the one thing, [music] worship me. worshiping [music] you. Oh, [music] there's nothing else that I [singing] ra [music] woring you. [music] Worshiping you. [singing] [music] And you make it easy. [singing] I'm so in love [music] with you. Oh, I long for those moments. [music] Just you and [singing] I. Lost in [music] your presence. I lose track of time.

[music] [singing] Oh, there's [music] nothing else that I I'd rather do. [music] Worshiping you. [music] Worshiping you. Oh, you [singing] make it easy, [music] Lord. I was so in love with you. Out on the waterers, storms raging high, the waters around them. They were troubled that night and fear [music] filled their hearts and they [singing] thought they would die. [music] They failed to [singing] remember. The [music] master was [singing] nigh and he [music] spoke the words and the winds all stood still. Even the [music and singing] waters they obeyed his will [singing] and he [music] calmed their storms just [singing] like he will mind [music] if I'll [singing] just remember. He [music] lives deep inside. So why [music] should I worry [singing] and why should I fear when [music] the very same Jesus he's [music] always so near. He [singing] lives in my heart and [music] he hears when [singing] I cry. I'll call on his [music] name till the storm passes [singing] by. We read [music] in the Bible when he [singing] walked with them, [music] brought light to the darkness. When the [singing] way [music] grew so dear, how great it would [music and singing] be to have his footsteps in mind [music] and walk with [singing] the master all of the time. [music] And when trials [singing] come and they'll seem [music] so nice, I'll just call on [singing] my master. I know he'll get [music] there on time. [singing] And when sickness comes and my body's [music] in pain, all [singing] I have to do is [music] call on his name. So why [music] should I worry? And why should I fear [singing] [music] when the very same Jesus well he [music and singing] stays always near. He lives [singing] in my heart and he hears [music] when I cry. I'll call [singing] on his name [music] till the storm passes by. So why should I [singing] worry [music] and why should I fear when the [singing] very same [music] Jesus he's always [singing] so near. [music] He lives in my heart. He hears [music and singing] when I cry. I call on his name [singing] till the storm passes [music] by. I sing praises to your name, [music] &gt;&gt; oh [singing] Lord.

[singing] [music] &gt;&gt; There is a blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. that [singing] cost a lot [music] &gt;&gt; that paid my way. [singing] &gt;&gt; And death is price. And when it [music] flowed [singing] down from the cross, [music] my sins were [singing] gone. [music] my sins for God. [singing] And there [music] is a grave. Oh, that tried to hide [singing] this precious blood. Oh, that gave me life. But in three [singing and music] days, he breathed again. [singing] and [music] rose to stand.

I owe my all. [music and singing] I owe my all. And so I come [music and singing] oh to tell you he's alive [music] and to tell you that he dries. Oh [singing] every [music] tear that falls. And so I come [singing] to tell you that he [music] saves. want to [singing] shout and to proclaim [music] that he's coming [singing] back for you.

[music] Amen. &gt;&gt; God has prepared every one of these moments, every one of these [music] lives, &gt;&gt; every one of you represented here, and God is in control of it all. As brother Kelly was preaching tonight, I'll just be honest, brother Kelly stood like a statesman, [music] &gt;&gt; and this quote just kept coming in my mind while brother Kelly was just ministering the word. Brother Brandham said, "When a baby is conceived in the womb of a mother, when that one cell goes in there, another cell builds on top of that, [music] it's not one cell of a human and the next of a dog and the next of a cat and the next of something else. It's [music] absolutely straightly human being. And when a man is born of the spirit of God, he don't inject anything into his life. It's unadulterated word of God vindicated for that hour. [music] He takes the full word of God. He don't put no creeds, nothing else into it. It's [music] purely unadulterated. God's word made manifest amongst you. He said, "Look in the Bible. You see what age that we're living in. When you see these great things being made manifest, when God promised to do it, he always does it at the end of each age. When the church has come to the turning place and it's turned from the word back to sin and worldliness, worldliness is sin." The Bible said, "If you love the world, the things of God, [music] the things of the world, the love of God's not even in you." But we've not turned back to the world. &gt;&gt; We are at a turning point. Brother Brandham said, "It took a master craftsman to be able to turn the corner." [music] &gt;&gt; And this message tonight, as I watched the man of God stand there like a statesman and build sale on top of sale on top of sale, he was not building a lukewarm church. He was not building a a denominational kind of a church. He was building sale on top of sale like a mother and a father when they're when they're having that little child when it's conceived in there. This bride has been taken on the word of God and it's building sail on TOP OF SAIL AND SIN DROPS OFF ON THIS SIDE AND we get a little BIT LIGHTER AND WE START CLIMBING INTO RAPTURE and grace. SAIL ON TOP OF SAIL UNTIL WE COME TO THE PERFECT STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN of God. [music] &gt;&gt; We are prepared for such a time as this. &gt;&gt; Come on, Queen Esther. I know you got a line on the inside of you and you know how pertinent this message was to you. I say that tonight was that kind of night when the king extended his scepter to you. One more time say you got grace to come here to my presence. DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT WHAT ANYBODY else says. Don't you worry about what anything else. I EXTENDED MY SCEPTER of grace towards your life AND YOUR FLESH HAS BEEN SEPARATED. LIGHT HAS BEEN SEPARATING DARKNESS ALL THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING TONIGHT. And if you knew what I knew, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT GOD'S GREAT LIGHT, HIS GREAT SPOTLIGHT HAS SHINE DOWN across this congregation tonight. And I begin to watch the waters roll back and darkness roll back. And I want to say this because I feel the presence of the Lord here is that God said it is good. [music] I say what has happened in your life, God says it is good. &gt;&gt; I say what brother Michael did while he was leading the worship here tonight. I say it's good. [applause and music] It's something amazing [music] when the spirit of the Lord begins to work all over the building. Brother Matthew, my brother, had text me before service said, "If you wouldn't mind, I'd like for you to sing There is a blood." And I had it here in my notes to sing [music] cuz that's what I'm doing while I'm building notes while a preacher's preaching. I'm building songs to [music] fit right in with the message. And I just felt to stop and invite Brother Michael. And his song is [music] There is a blood. I say God's in control of this building. I say God's in control of your thoughts. I'd say when you speak something in the atmosphere, something happens. CAN YOU SAY THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TONIGHT? Can you GIVE GOD PRAISE AND SAY, "GOD HAS DONE SOMETHING GOOD IN MY LIFE TONIGHT." Won't you look at your neighbor, shake their hand, AND SAY, "GOD HAS DONE something good in my life." Hallelujah. Well, I just want to praise his name. My goodness, what a meeting &gt;&gt; where the king comes. It's everything to me, ain't it? &gt;&gt; Ain't it to you the same way? Do you love the Lord with all your heart? &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you be dismissed tonight and [music] go in the name of the Lord. Come expecting. I tell you, my heart's full. And there's a little song that says, "I'm drinking from a saucer cuz my cuz my cup's [music] overflowing." I say, "Let it just pour on out all over us, saturate our beings, and I want to soak it up like a big old sponge." And I don't want to leave anything here this weekend. I come expecting. And I believe you have, too. Let's receive something from the Lord. I want you to do something. I want you to pray that God would deal with Brother Kelly in his night season tonight to [music] come. You know good and well there'll be more people here tomorrow that wasn't here tonight. And I want you to pray specifically for those people that God would do something. Use our brother Kelly in the middle of his night season that God would speak directly to him to say a word for our brothers and sisters. For every one of us. Can you do that? &gt;&gt; Don't pray for yourself tonight. I want you to pray for your brothers and sisters in this time of thanksgiving and gratitude. [music] Aren't we thankful for brothers and sisters that'll fight for you? that'll pray for you. [applause] Amen. Amen. God bless you tonight. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. God bless you. You're dismissed tonight in Jesus name. [music] God with you. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music]
