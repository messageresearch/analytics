Gentile bride her Prophet was meeting an angel and that angel was commissioning him to bring this message to this Gentile lady we think about all of these things where we are where we're standing at in the moments of time it makes us recognize we're in a season of rapture we're here we're here let's just go to the Lord in prayer father we approach you father Lord we we sense The Nearness of the Holy Spirit father here tonight Lord there's Lord if we could say it like this there's just a a special presence here father Lord things that we've longed for things that we love to be a part of things that we've told with all week long has allowed us to come and Lord uh it's it's created an atmosphere like we're in just now father Lord I believe that that it's you coming to inhabit the Praises of your people father I believe it's you that is coming here I recognize that we are in the presence of the mighty Angel one that did not go off the scene in 1965 but we recognize that there is there there's one still with the message today that's guiding its children all throughout the inheritance that is laid here from Genesis to Revelation we've searched the borders and they're ours this is our inheritance and it's a it's a goodly land father and Lord we just want to thank you for this land lord we want to thank you God for providing for us Lord a land flowing with milk and honey a land that is that it has all types of benefits in it father there's healing in this land there's salvation in this land there's Deliverance in this land father there's peace in this land and that's what our hearts are crying for is peace here on Earth oh God lord we're just asking God that this Christmas season would be extra special father Lord we recognize that the greatest gift was given 2,000 years ago when you came now we pray father that you'd come upon our hearts Lord Lord from everyone of us Lord I pray that you'd baptize us aresh father Lord we're getting ready to go into a new year season and thinking about these things father many people be renewing things and setting up different goals in their life but father as we come to the end of this year father I pray father that our hearts would cry out for more of God and less of oursel a greater surrender a greater sincerity father Lord I pray God that you would come amongst us tonight Lord we we know know that you're here and we know that you've gathered Lord your angels to watch your children worship now I would pray father as as I would begin to go through this text tonight I pray that you would be the one that would speak Lord Jesus may you come and visit us Lord vindicate your promises and we'll be careful to serve you and give you praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the book of Luke 3 Luke chap 3 and then Romans chapter 8 and verse 18 Luke chapter 3 and we'll start with uh verse 15 we recognize as as you're turning here to Luke chapter 3 that we recognize that this is when we begin to see the entrance of John the Baptist and his ministry as it's coming into full effect it's already been prophesied and now we are watching the the ministry of John come into full effect and and and there we see as it is perfectly aligning with with with Malachi's prophecy and Isaiah's prophecy and now we we we're just tapping in here just to catch this catch this Vision in Luke 3 and verse1 15 and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of John whether he were the Christ or not and John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than I cometh the latchees of his shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly Purge his floor and GA and will gather the wheat into his Garner but the Chas fa he will burn with fire unquenchable also Romans chap 8 and verse 18 Romans chapter 8 verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expect ation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why do he yet hope for but what but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it may God bless his word you may be seated to tonight in the presence of the Lord and I don't want to keep you too long here tonight but I I do want to take a few moments and I want to speak to you on a text that I I I I delivered some of these things last weekend and told you that I was going to be speaking on this thought on the long awaited for departure or the long awaited for fulfillment and I would like to just take some of those those same thoughts that we looked at last weekend or maybe we could just tie them some of those same things together but we we we want to look at this thought here and as we've we've read here in Romans chapter 8 we recognize that the scripture is is a present day newspaper and we recognize that it is it is up to dat and it is fresh to us and we recognize by the scripture reading here this evening that this scripture in Romans chapter 8 it signifies to us that the supernatural element of the Unseen that yet we we have not fully enjoyed all of the benefits of the Unseen it is showing to us something that that if we hope for that we see not then we do with patience wait for it it is showing to us that there is something in the future and yes we recognize that we are sitting here that we are under a restoration of the brid tree that we are understanding that all of the Mysteries have been revealed to the body of Jesus Christ but yet there is something that is on the inside of us that is groaning for the full manifestations of the adoptions of this body which is the body change so we recognize that we're not fully enjoying all of the benefits that are laying here but it's something that is saying that it's something that we're hoping for if we see it then why should we wait for it so we don't have to wait for something that we already have but yet we are fully here and we are waiting on our body change is that right I believe that every person here as as the day goes on as we get older in our life it's something that we long for it's something that is constantly that is on our mind it is upon that body change when you wake up in the morning and you've got a new you've got a new backache you've got something new you begin to your eyes as your eyes begin to get dim you begin to look under those things and this is what Paul is saying here is that that we are hoping unto these things and many may not understand this but I believe that predestination is driving Humanity in the ministry or Angelic Messengers in this hour to to fulfill the very mysteries of almighty God I believe that it's predestination that is making men take thoughts of like of what William Brandon would say and things that are to be and then we would look in Third Exodus and things of of of modern events made clear by prophecy but I believe that it is predestination that is driving man to look into these things and to pull out the Hidden Truths and to tie these things together for the body of Jesus Christ and I personally believe that there are key components that are laying there and maybe you don't fully understand why why do these people why do why do men of God keep studying why do men of God keep keep studying these things out they we've heard these tapes we've read these things we've we've looked over these scriptures of maybe hundreds or thousands of times I personally have listened to Christ the mystery of God over 300 times but yet there's something on the inside of me that makes me long to listen to more of it but what is it I believe that it is predestination that is driving Humanity or driving the ministry because because maybe you don't fully understand or maybe you don't capture the whole Vision here but I believe that it is that it is the predestinated mind of God that men would stay driven that men would stay passionate where because we're looking for that last seed I I believe that that last seed is the most valuable seed and I believe that it's that that last seed is is just is as valuable as you are here tonight and maybe you've heard these things and maybe you've read these things and maybe You' come to full maturity in it but I believe that there's one seed left maybe there's a few seeds left and I believe that we ought to study these things and preach these things with everything that is within us and it and it might be maybe it's just above you just a little bit or maybe maybe you think well I'm on thee of that but there's somebody there there's somebody there's one seed that's got to be watered there's there's another seed that's got to be mature there's another seed that's got to come to life and when she comes in we will go is that right I believe that that that that last seed brother bisco would say it like this that the last seed would be the most costly seed because thousands of miles have been put on for that last seed thousands of tapes have been played thousands of visions and thousands of things have been put into fruition for that last seed and I'll say this that we are a lighthouse that is still looking for that last seed that we're still pointing that there is a God in this gen in this generation I don't believe that we ought to back up and I don't believe that we ought to that we ought to step back off of his promises but I believe that we ought to be looking for that last one it could be your neighbor it could be your loved one it could be and I'd say that it's worth testifying about I believe that it's worth preaching about tonight I believe that what Jesus came to do I believe he is doing it in the bride's body for this we know that brother Brandon would teach us that predestination looks back to for knowledge and for knowledge looks on to Destiny so we recognize that God all the way back there in the very beginning that he he saw all of these things as they were coming into fruition he saw that last seed he saw you and I believe that you have a destiny here tonight I don't believe that your destiny is to be sick and I do not believe that your destiny is to live here in Le osia and constantly be tormented by Le osia but I believe that there is something that is on the inside of this bride's body that she's constantly longing for I believe that it is the full manifestation of the sons of God that we take this body change if Enoch could be translated and he lived so close to God I believe that in this generation that there's going to be a people that have long awaited that same translation that same horse of fire to come sweeping by her way I believe that it's something that we waited for but I do not believe it's it's too far out there in front of us I'm not trying to stick a carrot out in front of the horse and say it's way out there but I'm trying to say to you that you can have everything that is laying right here in the promises of God and I know there's a lot of people that like to put things off in the future that one day we'll become the sons of God but 1 John 3 and2 tells us that now are we the sons of God you don't have to wait to fully manifest yourself you don't have to wait until the preacher prays for you you don't have to set there and wait for the pastor to come and lay his hands upon you but I believe that right now where you are as a son and daughter of God that you can fully manifest yourself as an robed adopted son and daughter of God I believe that this voice of Resurrection is in the bride's body that one of these mornings between the hours of 6 and N the thing that we've waited for the thing that we've longed for that voice of Resurrection that called to Lazarus and said come forth that voice of Resurrection in the bride's body will call for her body change hallelujah hallelujah now look you got to think about this that as we read we read the Bible and we think about it and so so many times we look back at it as a book of history but you've got to think that Paul was in the same spot that you are in Paul was looking for the second coming of Christ just like you're looking for it you see because if Christ would have stood back there and told the ages now look it's going to be another 2,000 years before I come again before my second coming if he would have told the generations or the church ages then you would see men of old and you would see that the church would get laxed or they would have fell short on the work of the Lord but God had them believing that it was going to be just in their hour it's just they had to have that anticipation that it was getting ready to happen happened and they were living out the message for their day as he was coming right there and I believe that's the way you ought to live right now I don't care I don't I don't know if it's 10 years from now but I believe that you ought to live like it's today now notice what brother bam said in the question question and answers there's a question that came to him on the in the seals it said should evangelist continue on the field and I'm just going to hit the highlights here he said but certainly by all means don't change a thing he said if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like it was going like it was going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be this hour he said if you're building a house put it on up he said if Jesus comes tomorrow you'd be found faithful at the duty he said if you're building your church go on put it up he said continue right on just go right on as you are he said now for instance if you was working for a man and you know it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you'd say it's it's just 15 minutes it's more or so I might as well just go over here and sit down he said you have got docked for that 15 minutes he said if you're planting wheat plant your wheat if you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out well say well nobody will eat them that don't make any difference you dig them out anyhow just continue on as you are you see why you've been preaching the same message for all these years I'm still continuing on as I am I ought to live today like he coming today I lived and I preached like he was coming 15 years ago and I believed it then as much as I believe it right now he said you just continue on as you are he said you'll be found faithful at the post of Duty he said well you say brother Bram if he was to come in the morning shouldn't you be out there he said no sir this is my post of Duty I'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things I am then when he comes I'll just move right on out with him he said if I'm hoing potatoes then I'll go on just to Ho away as hard as I can he said when he comes in I just drop the hoe and take off he said but you remember in the Jubilee year he said when they was hoing with that hoe he said they just kept on hoing he said they know that the Jubilee years wasn't more maybe more than 10 minutes more and the trumpet would sound for the Jubilee year he said but they just kept on pitching hay or whatever they was doing he said but when the trumpet sounded they Dro their Pitchfork and gone don't you know that this message has already sounded to this bride Generation all you've got to do is lay off your old sins lay off everything that's a part of well glory to God there's men of passion that still believe in living out the message there's men that are driven to believe the message just as we said it last weekend when men would rise up underneath of Paul like polycarp and they would carry on the message just like it was in Wesley's day there would be men like finny and SMI Smith Wigglesworth that would rise up Spurgeon and they would rise up and they would carry on the message of that day so is it in this hour there have been men that have rose up under their anointed seventh angel Messenger to carry on the message men like Ed bisco that would not refuse to believe that the message was over over until he completely got it into every language somebody was going to rise up under their messenger and be anointed to carried out men like Tim puit when people told him that he shouldn't have been preaching when he was 15 years old he started pastoring started preaching 17 years old started pastoring but though they were they were anointed under their messenger men like men like David mayor men like Ron Spencer men like Jason Jackson men like Wayne law and men like these brothers and sisters that are sitting here what are they doing they're under the anointing of the messenger of this age and I'm going to say it to you like your Prophet said unto you that there is another again another people in the land who under their messenger not outside of your messenger not out there believing what the church world is doing but under your messenger will be the final voice to the final age you say well brother Andrew it's Christmas season preach to us a Christmas message this is the greatest gift that ever has been given it's Jesus Christ God would raise up men and preserve them for this hour he would deposit Homer Fraser in this in this area he would deposit Donnie Reagan and in in Kentucky and move him to Tennessee he would he would deposit men like Billy Andrews and then raise up a generation of Believers men like Josh Bennett what is it it's God Gathering his seed that he thought of before the foundation of the world he thought of them he didn't think of them as losers he thought of them as winners he didn't think of them as quitters he thought of them as Overcomers now if God has got a Ministry that still believes that this is an angel's message then there's got to be a people that step in line to that message and get in line with that message let me tell you Church there is no Rapture outside of this message and I know that's hard for the church world to understand that but I believe that there's got to be a full restoration back to the Church of the Living God and we're not waiting waiting for that no more because we already have that come on somebody you're not waiting on Malachi for it to come and to preach the message the message has already been preached all you're waiting on is for your body to catch up with a vision come on somebody we've already preached that God sent a prophet but how about preaching God's got a bride God's got a wife God's got an elect lady that's carrying on this last day message that will four feel every bit of Malachi [Applause] four what is it elaser was hunting out a bride brother brandham said he wasn't looking for the denominations in the Creed he said because they had surely they had a lot of quantities out there he said but what elezra was looking for was quality he was looking for a character that would match Isaac's character or was it when El ezrael was coming and he was preaching what was he doing he was hunting out a bride I believe some of these young boys ought to get to hunting out thems a bride but I believe that it's a spirit of the age I'm going to preach just a little bit Pastor right here but I believe that it's a a spirit of the age that makes people want to long till they're about 30 years old and they've got themselves good and established before they ever gets a wife you watch now you watch it's a spirit of an age that'll come upon a man that'll make him go and start looking after men things that's a devil right there let me ask you you said well you got P you got parents today that's well you ought to wait till they got at least $80,000 in the bank got a home got a home that they can live in got all these all these fine qualities of things how many of y'all had that come on somebody all we had was two nickel to rub together I could barely afford well I ain't going to tell no lie but I couldn't afford what I can afford now but back then I'd have thought man I was a popper compared to what things are like now just a different world but to think that people have set it up and established well I you know what you ought to quarter for two and a half years and then let me tell you that's going to get you in in trouble brother and people that believe in them long engagements they ask him for trouble I'm done with my pastoral work we're getting back to evangelism just for a minute then I'll jump back to it Brothers get yourself a wife and get yourself married if she's the right one stop waiting around on Miss Perfect on somebody that stepped out of out of a magazine this message is everything that you have need of if you see the qualities of Rebecca on the inside of her it doesn't matter if she's got every hair in line or whether she's got a million dollars in the bank y'all hear me that's going to everybody on internet because I have been sat down and talked to around this message with young people what's the problem brother Andrew it seems like they wait until they're 28 years old until they want to get married anymore that wasn't my problem let tell you something there's a few guys had their eyes on that girl right there but when I showed up I'm sorry Dan D told me I got the prettiest girl in Tennessee and I took her to Virginia and I said yes sir sure did thank you Lord all right let me get back to hope y'all right out there y'all breathing all right don't go out and marry somebody you don't know but there's a lot of ways you can interpret that but I trust you know what I'm saying what was what was El eer doing he was hunting for a bride somebody that was going to match the match Piece of Heaven what did William brandham do he didn't come here and preach to all he didn't preach to the denomination to Pentecostals the Pentecostals thought they already had him but there elaser was hunting out a bride that would match the king of Heaven there was something in heaven that was longing for a wife that could be a part of him that could be bone of his bone life of his life power of his power what was it when eleazer saw Rebecca doing what he prayed for he said that's the one that I prayed for she got under the inspiration of elzar's prayer what what did this last day bride do she got under the anointing of Malachi th and he was hun for a bride that would wash that would worship that would carry water to her camels that would carry her back to her Heavenly bridegroom what are you doing what are you doing Rebecca every single time you start carrying that water praise and he start watering those camels you are praising the power that will take you to your classic yeah some people don't understand that but Rebecca the more she carried the more she carried the more she was given strength for her to take her Rapture and the more you praise and the more you give and the more you love and the more you show it shows that there's a match piece here on Earth and the marriage certificate of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is shown in this bride's body now notice notice what the Bible said but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it so there's got to be an expectation so where there is a strong desire for an object or a corresponding expectation of obtaining it so there's got to be something that longs for it there's got to be something that longs for that it's something on the inside of a man that makes that that wants him to have have a wife it's something on the inside of that girl you watch that little girl doesn't matter if she's 2 years old she's got something on the inside of her that she's got to Mother them little baby dolls it's amazing thing it's something that maybe maybe she grew up in a home that didn't have a mother but it's something that God put on that inside of that little girl that she's got a mother something and she can take that little baby doll and it's something laying there and it's got to be made manifest so she takes a baby do but today we live in a world where people want to take dogs and take cats and mother them instead of having children in this hour but you see the reason why you want children is because God put something on the inside of you to make you long to have children the reason why you long for the Holy Ghost is because God put something on the inside of you that would make you expect the Holy Ghost all right am I preaching to you now a reason why that you are wanting a body change is because God told you about it hallelujah it's like a kid on Christmas they would think it's just another day but you told him it was different you told him there was something different about Christmas didn't you you told him that on that day that you took some time out of your life to go out there and buy something that you thought that they would like and they know that there's something waiting on them Hallelujah there's something waiting on them I tell you it's something about the on the inside of a kid when Mama and Daddy ain't around they want to go around there and they want to shake that box they want to find out what's on the inside of and I know good and well there's a whole bunch of kids sitting in them 50y old men out there Mama's away yes Milwaukee new drill praise God the inside of that little child when they begin to look at those things they look at the shape of the Box they begin to think about it they shake it they get the sound of it and they lay there all night long thinking about what's in that box Mama never could wrap wrap a basketball up too good but I always knew when there was a basketball wrapped up and I'd lay there thinking I was playing for Roy Williams part of the tar Hills man alive I was something else in my dreams but I was born a Spencer and I couldn't hardly get off the ground so the tar Hills never got to my expectation but in my dream I was expecting them to call me what happened Mama wrapped up a basketball and it made me think it made me dream it made me expect that in the morning I'm going to unwrap that thing they would sometimes unwrapped things and I didn't get what I thought I was getting sometimes I open up praise God moving on H but there something there on the inside of that little child it's just like you you've been told there's a body change coming you've been told that there's a Rapture coming you've been told that there's healing coming you've been told that there's Deliverance coming and I'll be honest I've been up shaking the Box a little bit every been sometimes when I wake up at 2:00 3:00 in the morning and I get to Shake in the box and I begin to think about it is it right for me to expect brother Ron's healing is it right for me to express brother Donnie's healing is it right is it right is it right for me to expect a body change is it right and I shake the box and I find that when I open up the seals and find out it's like a kid on Christmas morning you got what you expected for let me tell you Church of the Living God the seals have been rolled off of it you're going to match what your expectation is the reason why job wanted to say to know God God is was because God asked him do you know me do you know me job the reason why you're expecting these things is because it's been long prophesied that there's going to be a body there's going to be a change there's going to be a woman that's bone of his bone life of his life she's sinless she's virtuous she's watched in his blood what is it it's a strong desire it's a strong desire and it makes you persevere what will desire do it'll bring you a Revival that's what the Bible said that hope is or faith is Faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of Things Not Seen when the Bible told us in Romans chapter 4:18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall th see be and be and not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb consider not your consider not your weak body consider not your frails consider not all your failures and your mistakes come on somebody consider not the problems that are stacked up against you consider it not Abraham but against hope when it looked hopeless his belief was not in vain your faith is not in vain hallelujah it's like a lot of people many of you taking trips you begin to plan out that trip maybe you maybe you're planning something out in the future maybe you're planning on going to Hawaii someday maybe you're planning to go go across Seas maybe you're going planning what are you doing you're you're making plans let me tell you a person that doesn't have plans for a long trip like like that you're going to get there and things are going to be all scrupled up but when a person spends all those time all that time they they spend countless hours searching out the destination that they're going to they the plans have been made the countless hours of preparing they look at the road mapap of how they're going to get there they look at the the flight gates that they've got to make the connections all of the energies that's going into it the monies that have went into it but when that day comes when that day comes you're not no longer waiting for it you're in the Fulfillment of your plans and a lot of times you get more excited about the plans than you do about the trip you've been on them trips you've been on them trips you planed everything out your wife's done spent countless hours looking at Pinterest and getting interested in it she's look at all the internet sites this is where we got to stop at these are the clean rest areas these are the these are the places this is what these are the places that you stop at this is the pl this is the best known place to eat at let me tell you that's what gets me interested can I get amen and the brother said amen when you think about it you spend they spend all of that time prepping and something goes wrong it wasn't me I planned it out correctly must have been somebody else's fault but let me tell you this there's these kinds of trips in the natural that will constantly let you down but this trip that we're getting ready to take it'll never let you down god'll never let you down God will take you to the right spot let me tell you you're going to the best place that you ever can't eat at it's a seven course menu That's laid out before you it's a table hallelujah it's a table that's a th000 miles long it's a table sitting there with all of your family and every one of them's going to be there Hallelujah I heard the prophet say heard the prophet say in the message prodical you're going to like this I heard him say he said that that prodal had long been waiting had long been waiting to come to himself and he said I watch him come to himself and he said he started singing tell my mother I'll be there Hallelujah it was something on the inside of him that reminded him that he was a son to begin with but a lot of times people get their eyes on the wrong prodal the other brother because he was jealous because he was jealous because his because his brother had spent all of his living out there with with all kinds of women spending out there doing drugs spending out there but he looked up him and scorned him because his daddy received him as a son when he didn't even act like a son he was just as much as prodal as that boy was out there blessed be the name of the Lord let me tell you something don't you miss don't you miss what is happening here don't you get your eyes on well that one was out there sinning I was in here in the house of God I was out there let me tell you the reason why you're a son is because he thought of you he deposited something on the inside of you blessed be the name of the Lord and something guided him back home it's the same thing that gued you home home it's the same thing that led you home it was an angel William Bram said an angel went there and tapped him on the side and said it's time to go home son what made the other prodal change his heart the same Angel what made you change your tune and you were sitting here and you are watching us worship what happened the angel the angel bumped into you now don't don't don't don't don't don't take this don't take this wrong but there's sometimes that people get Afflicted because of your worship and they don't understand what is going on they don't fully understand what's happening and they're setting in the seat of the prodal but oh if you could just W wake up that angel if you could just bump into that angel one time if you could be like Peter and John down there on the inside of that jail or Paul and Silas down in that jail and start worshiping God the way that you were built to worship that when they begin to worship all the chains of everybody in that jail cell were loose at the worshiping when they begin to sing songs and hymns unto almighty God and what is happening when brother Jordan breaks into an atmosphere and channels the Holy Ghost he's bump into an angel what happens sis when sister Rachel hits another octave she's bumped into an angel what happens what is it that angel is working the building it's working the building looking for everyone of you Hallelujah that God that God was there by an Angel and led him back home my brother B said brother bar said you were birth here your birth here was pre-planned I guess you believe that that every one of you knows that our birth was pre-planned you do know that your being here never originated just as a myth or a thought everything was all pre-planned by almighty God if you're ever going to take a trip you're going to have to have somebody that's going to be your guide somebody that's going to lead you brother random would tell us in the message of God he said now a God has to know the way he has to know where he's going or what he's doing and how to take care of you along the road you see if you brother random said if you don't have a God you got a 1% chance to make it back on your own you got 1% chance to make it back on your own but that God has been certified if you're hunting he's been certified by the state to go out there and look out where you are going and he knows that if you get lost he can find his way to you because he studied out Le otsy he study out the road maps down here in Elon and down here in Gros and he knows where you're at he knows when you get on them Crossroads and he don't know which way to take so the GU will come there and lead you that's what William bam said in leadership he said you from your very first birth you were led by your parents he said when you die you're going to be led by somebody so somebody's got to lead you so if you're going to go on a trip then somebody's got to lead you is that right you see because if you don't make his preparations and you're figuring on taking a trip where you haven't been before you might just come up lost you remember when William Brandon preaches that thought he preaches that thought that there's a daddy that's wanting to take his that take his son and he'd been reading in a magazine about these hunting trips he didn't really know what he was doing but he took his son all the way up on the mountains and he got up here and he froze to death and that boy lost his life because that Daddy didn't take the right precaution and I believe that too many people have climbed the thought of unbelief thinking that they were going in the right way but they should have took a guide with him brother bandam said if that man would have studied he would have saved his son's life you see you got to have a God and you might think that you're well qualified to do it all on your own you remember William brandham thought he was he was well qualified and he got himself on that Indian on that Indian crosswalk and he got himself good and lost but there was somebody that W up there and tapped him on the shoulder said I'm a everpresent help in the time of trouble what is he he's Jehovah shama when you're in trouble that means the Lord is there when does Jehovah Gyra show up when does Jehovah nii show up when does Jehovah Shalom show up when does Jehovah tianu show up in the middle of your chaos he could have never declared himself as Jehovah Gyra unless Abraham was in need of providing of a lamb he could have never showed himself as Jehovah Rafa unless you got sick he could have never showed himself as the guide unless you'd have been lost and I've said this a thousand times but I'm going to say it a thousand one times you say well brother Andrew I'm listening to you on the internet and I'm as lost as lost can be good cuz that means you can be found the first the first state of it is recognizing that you're lost William Brenham thought he had everything figured out but there was something that he was waiting on down there at the end of that mountain well was it it was everything that he longed for everything that he loved everything that he held dear in life his mother his wife and his son out there but his own his own Consciousness got him in this mess up there on that death walk but he had his hands in the air he was looking for a line he was looking for a line because he'd been up there before he'd been up there before with an Ranger and told him and they put that line up there and he knew that if he could ever get a hold of that line it would lead him back to his wife it would lead him back to his son and you've been here before you've sat in services like this before you've heard preaching like this before you walk this line before but if you can just lift up your hands everything that you've been waiting on is at the end of this line you said well I don't know how much more I can go let me tell you when you running out of rope my God will throw you a line come on somebody William brandom said I thought I had it when I grabbed a hold of self of a limb he said but I found out it was a false religion and you may have thought you got yourself something when you was down at the altar one night but you found yourself out there living with somebody else's wife you got got a hold of somebody's false religion but when you got a hold of the message you knew it was going to lead you right back to Jesus what is it what is it we recognize where we are the planning of God has led us here everything that we've waited for everything that we've longed for when you go to reading in Exodus chapter 12 when there they had seen all of these Messiah signs they' seen all the manifestation of the son of man working through Moses what was it the son of man made an invasion down in Egypt he worked his way down into Egypt and he showed himself but he told him go get yourself a lamb go get yourself a lamb keep him 14 days he's got to be without blemish he's got to be perfect why is he got to be perfect he's got to be perfect for you what was it it was a perfect type of Christ and when they kept him up they couldn't y they had to they had to kill it out they had to take the blood and place it across the door it was a perfect cross what was he applying it by my hiss up perfect Faith laying out there crossing over the door showing that death could not come to where this lamb was and when they were standing there when they were standing there on that side of the blood they recognized that death could not get to them ain't it a wonderful thing tonight know brother Jim that death can't get to you because the lamb is there don't you know that when John was standing there when John was standing there and they were musing in their hearts is this him or is this not him is this Messiah or is this not the Messiah but John said I must decrease so that he can increase what was John pointing to I'm not the Messiah but I'm pointing you to a messiah what was he doing what was it the Bible said that they expected it they expected the Messiah there was a heart's desire in the hour for the Messiah to show up and John was preaching such a Ministry that it looked so much like him that the people mused in their hearts is this him is this him you watch it it correlates perfectly with the Forerunner of this age as John the Baptist was first was the first Forerunner so will your message William brandham forun the second coming of all of Christ what was it it was a perfect overlay it was a forerunning but you watch as people mused in our hearts is this him is this his second coming they they got confused they thought it was Christ in brandham what was it they saw so much God in William brandham they thought they thought John was the Christ they thought William brandham was the Christ but William brandham said you keep on preaching I'm not the Christ I'm just a signpost to you he said it wasn't me down there on the Ohio River down there he said I was only near when he showed up what he tell to you he said what are you doing you're not feeding on the mind of a man you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man it wasn't me it wasn't the seventh angel it was a mighty Angel what was it when he's standing there in the Ohio River baptizing 500 people and the 17th person as he's baptizing them a Mystic star shows over top of William brandham and a voice cries out as John the Baptist was for was the first of four run the first coming of Christ so will your message it was seen all the way in Canada all the way in the newspapers it was car carried up there what was it it was a sign it was a sign that this is the hour that this is the moment this is the time that I'm coming for a people it was a sign to this generation that God was gathering a people for his name's sake it had long been waited on and what did this messenger do just like John did he went into the Unseen World and he brought back Hidden Truths he went in there and he went into the those things and he brought them back here so that you could understand it my grandmother Nancy told me when I was just a when I was just a a young Christian she told me she said I fully didn't understand the Bible I read it every day she said but when the message came by our way she said I begin to see the Bible in a new light how many can identify themselves with that you couldn't understand what Revelations was you couldn't understand what the scripture said in there but God sent a prophet to you to tell you what these things are and to the denominations they're still closed off but to you I want you to think about this you look out there on them denominations and I'm not making lie of them but you look out there you look out there and you see the manifestations of powers of of Joy shouts coming upon Pentecostals and people demonstrating powers of casting out demons and and cancer leaving bodies and they're doing that with Loose Ends what ought this body ought to be doing with every loose end tied up together what ought this to do the things that we waited for they're here the tokens in hand the lamb has been killed don't eat it wrong kill the lamb I burn it with fire eat the lamb John take the whole book eat the whole book come on I'm preaching you the message today what did William Bram do he said John was sent there to wind up those loose ends he said but in this age and he goes in there and he tells us that time shall be no more and he goes into Revelations chapter 10 and he preaches a message to us sir is this the sign of the end and he said are we at the end where are we at could this be he said could this be the thing that puts us into rapturing Faith he said could this be the thing that makes us jump up and leap over a wall he said could this be the thing what was the messenger doing he was Awakening our expectation for the manifestations of sons of God to think that we were living in an hour we were so close that William R said we probed at it we looked at it what was it when John stood there in Matthew chap 11 and Jesus is having himself a preaching Revival he's having a healing Revival and John starts hearing about these things and brother Rand said that John's Eagle Eye got filmed over and he said and he sent some of his disciples down there said now look go ask him are you the one that we're looking for are you the one we're looking for and you go to look up that word in Matthew 11 and3 I believe it's are you the one that we're looking for when you look up that word look it means are you the one that we're expecting but his Eagle eyed got filmed over because when he's standing there on the banks of Jordan and he's baptizing Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world what was it he got up there and he got in prison but brother random said that Jesus didn't send him some book how to be happy down there in jail he said John just take a look at what's happening down here in Elton just take a look at what's going on the blind are being healed the blind are receiving their sight the sick are being healed John I am perfectly on schedule everything's right in line what was it Jesus was showing that the increase had came what is it in your hour when you start seeing the manifestations of sons of God it's Jesus showing the increase hallelujah it's Jesus showing the increase when they were looking when they were looking for one he came looking for them I I just want to I'm not going to get finished with this song but I I want to read you this and we'll probably come to a close here brother brand said I was reading a story some years ago and he said in this story he said a great Noble King he said if I forget his name he said just now he said I wasn't thinking about speaking of the story he said perhaps perhaps it's fiction he said but it leads us to a point that gives us a background on what we want to say he said this King he was such a noble King and such a great lover of his subjects till one day before his guards and his royalty he said today you see me for your last for many years and his guards and his Nobles said to him good King why why you say that are you going to a foreign country somewhere and become an alien he said no I'm staying right here well I I'm going out amongst my subjects I'm going to be become a peasant I'm going to cut wood with a wood Chopper I'm going to teal ground with a toiler I'm going to prune vines with those who prune Vines I'm going to be one of them in order to get a better acquainted with what they're doing I love them and I want to be more acquainted with them personally and I they won't know me but yet I want to be acquainted with them in that way and the next morning when his delegates and all of his people seen him were the ones that was was in the palace take off of his crown and lay it down upon the seed in his throne and take his robe off and put on peasants clothes and walk out amongst the common people he said in that little story he said we find out then about God that said to the king said King we want you we love you we want you to remain King but he wanted to become one of them to know them better that they would know him better really what he was it would display to them what what he really was and he said that's what God did he changed himself from being Jehovah God to become one of us that he might suffer that he might taste death that he might know what the sting of death was and take the penalty of death upon himself and he laid aside his crown and his robe and became one of us he washed feet with the lowely he dwelt in tents with poor he slept in the woods and the streets and those who were under privileged he became one of us that he might understand us better that we might understand him better to think that all of these prophecies you're getting ready to see the results of it all of these Visions that's been manifested Isaiah Ezekiel all of these things are laying there and now he wants to become one of you so he leaves the portals of Heaven this has been long waited for they're looking for a great General they're looking for somebody that can lead their armies and Destroy Rome but he comes as a baby he could have had everything in life he could have been born in the finest of palaces but he left all of the glory of Heaven to take on the road Robes of humanity when he's sitting there at the widows of na son in the book in The Book of David there's a man that wrote on the book of David brother brandom identifies it and grabs it and he attaches it and he says that Jesus was sitting there by that side of that road and his head was hurting so bad but he was sitting there waiting waiting waiting for that son to come waiting for that one that was dead to come by his way when brother Brandon said he wanted to feel like you felt when you have a headache you know what it's like when your head's hurting so bad that all you want to do is close your eyes and get in there and shut your shut your door off to all the noises and everything Jesus understands because he took on the robe of humanity to understand understand what it's like when you've worked all day and your feet are hurting he waited for the perfect time he could have came any other other day could have come at any other time but he waited for the right time when all the prophecies and all the Visions was coming to be made manifest brother brand brother Bram said I was out hunting I'm closing here brother BR said I was and the musicians could come said I I was out hunting he said we was having a good time he said but he said something moved on me to go back into town to get some more shells and he said I he said I really didn't understand what I was doing he said but I I said I just went he said I wanted to go back in and he said I told Brother Banks wouldn't he said now you take me by the store and he said I'm going to go by that store and I'm going to get us plenty of shells so we can do some target shooting and he said I went in there he said we was going by there and he said brother bankswood he said he said I stand out there and brother bankswood was trying to get on the street trying to C he said said he went around there 15 times and I sat there and I was thinking why why are all these things happening why why can't he get why can't he find the spot he said but at that same time there was a sister by the name of sister Burns that her husband that her husband had been diagnosed with cancer on the spleen and said that sister Burns was up there and said she was holding that picture of the pillar of fire and said she was sitting there holding it and was praying said praying said now angel of God I don't know where William brandham is but if you could just sit in by my way to pray for my husband that's got this cancer on this plane and said when she got done praying said she jumped up said you know what I got to go pay my utility bill I got to go pay my utility bill and said when she went down there he said brother Banks Woods had been going around the wrong streets 15 times he said but God was holding me there for that sister when she turned the corner after paying her utility bill he said when she paid that stepped around the corner there God completely manifested himself and completely healed brother Burns you think that the god ain't figured out where you are and you might think why in the world am I going around these circles like I'm going and why am I being led the way I'm being led why why am I being led in prayer the way I'm being led in prayer why I keep going around these circles why I keep don't you think that God's got something in [Music] it why I keep falling like I keep falling why I keep going through what I keep going through don't you see God's got something in it you know good and well when God strength and his power he could have picked me up 20 years before I got in my situations of life but God had me going through what I was going through for this brother or for that sister because it was going to be a testimony to you that God Saves the worst of Sinners I heard Prophet sa when he was talking about the woman at the woman at the wh he said there was something on the inside of her that he saw that was redeemable that's why he went up there that's why I sat down at the well she'd been looking for the right kind of a man she'd been guided to the wrong spots all of her life but this day the one that saw fit to redeem all of her he didn't just want her body he wanted her soul he saw something that was redeemable on the inside of her she'd been waiting for it she'd been looking for it I want you to know that the one that you've been waiting for is in the room he ain't in some manger and he ain't laying there and laying there with a cow crying over him and camels and all kinds of things with the things of of the nature hanging on him as a little bitty
