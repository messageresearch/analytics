we go into it I was just praying about it this weekend um and these words came to me everything has an order and I pray about this dedication and I wanted to be here and I wanted to be a part of it and everybody's words would continue to come everything has an order and how important it is to not a gettin out of order and when God created the animals and he created everything man comes along and destroys one one part of a specie but that that specie has a real important part and then brother Branham said nobody can take your place I don't think about that just a moment nobody can take your place brother John if if you decide to step aside and say you know I don't care anymore what about your boys it's generational what about your children what about your children's children the children's children's children's children well we know that God will watch over his seed because he's got a plan I thought about brother Joe said in here brother Homer but this church has meant at this place but the home were working in a stockroom an inviting brother Joe and brother Joe which I don't know some of your new he's one of the most brilliant men I've ever met in my life he's like EF Hutton if he says that I I write it down and so brother Joe was invited to church and he says he's made a determination if I go to the service tonight and if I don't see brother homer outside I'm not going in and something nudges brother Homer to go outside and stand on the porch you think god don't care about you he said what does that have to do it has a whole lot to do with the baby dedication this morning God's watched over your lineage he's watched over your seed and and toward the end of the message brother Branham preaches a sermon called and it's just a little little little sermon but it's powerful one in a million one in a million if you haven't if you haven't read it lately go reread it God washed over that one cell in a million no funeral for the 999 no funeral but he's watched over that seat he's protected that Saint William to watch over you watched over that everything has an order how great it is how great it is now for those that don't know me I just don't know me well at home I want to just share a couple things here is this okay just to take it moment I won't preach long but I've been pastoring here about 20 years and so and so I get I get gifts gifts and so I got

something about our baby sister I can't be mean to her and I will never share my toys and here's the part I don't know if he's going to be able to hold up - I can't think I can't throw rocks at her

I love you with all my hearts and so I'll share the scripture with you and the nail can come deuteronomy chapter 6 in verse 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord with them with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon their head and they shall

and it's just cancer but God is greater than all other you so we thank you for your patience with us and even this morning I seem to be a little bit a little bit discombobulated in my my vision but for those that don't know I I had I'm not steady in my eyes anymore and so they don't let me drive Matt might be a great thing and so and then some days I'm not steady in my vision which causes me to

as an audience and I love you as a people and and I have a lot of great friends in the earthing and God's going to be good to me and so a man Andrew came over to the house last night and he throwed a rock up and Elijah's cave and so I'll do it back at him at this morning amen so I'd like to say happy Father's Day to you and we love you with all of our hearts and and I'd like to speak to you this morning the best of my ability that he will give me I must get to Jesus and I want to preach this with a personal Flair I felt like a fella said can I do this can I do it but today as a sermon I want to preach it this way I'm the one that's got to get there I gotta get to him this is life and death I gotta get to him brother Branham said this he says there's no one cares not Jesus knowing that his body as a high priest in a mediatorial work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of God at all times for intercession that God cannot see the sinners sin he only sees the blood of his own son and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to work comfort his people does he care certainly he cares he says now he was to continue to care for the people his people here on the earth in the same manner that he cared for him them when he was here and I believe that he's the same God for me right now brother Greg and maybe you're sick wherever you're at and maybe you're in the same need that where I'm at now and say he cares for brother Ron you cared for me and means how many it's got a need this morning you just like to say you care for me a man a man mark chapter five and verse 21 and when Jesus passed over again by the Shipman to the other side that much people gathered under him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue Jarius my name and when he saw him he fell at his feet and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death and I I pray they come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people followed and thrown him on a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years and he suffered many things of great physicians that had spent old and she had spent all that she had and nothing bettered but rather grew worse so this was a last resort and when she had heard of Jesus compressing behind touched His garment and she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall behold you talking about desperation and straightway the fountain of blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes and the disciple said unto Him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me and he look around about to see because he cared that's why he looked he cared to see what had been done by this thing and the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done and came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and behold of thy plague notice that in that moment 12 years of agonizing in that moment the very elements of her body were changed and while he yet spake there was a ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said they daughter is dead why troubled the master in him any further and as soon as Jesus as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he said to the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid you talking about being in control of a situation there's a theme that's going on here look past what you see think pass what you think and Jesus is standing with the decide with this man and he's just gotten news that his daughter has died and Jesus's whole journey is to go to his house and if I'm on the way to the house no matter her condition she's going to be well and if he put this on my heart for weeks he's on the weight of this house and I may be weak to preach this sermon but I'm going to be well the spring Almighty God we love you with all of our hearts today and Lord that some things are way bigger than us and you're a great God and so not only for myself but there's needs that I'm carrying from around the world to this pulpit today that are burdened on my heart I ask you that you would touch those needs stretch forth your hand of mercy and go beyond the realm of my own flesh now and bring me strength to be able to preach one X again help me Father I ask you now in Jesus name Amen amen you can be seated I want to just catch a couple of scriptures if I may or a couple of quotes if I may in parts of them brother Branham is preaching in a very important meeting in Tacoma and he and the title of his sermon was he was to pass this way now sometimes you think well that's just a sermon title no that's an event Jesus is passing this way not 2,000 years ago he's not a historical God death but he's using his prophet as a divine seer and he's standing in a pulpit and he's saying some words Jesus is to pass this way and then in the paragraph 37 he says Zack is a set in the tree and he raised his leaf and he began to look and Jesus walked along with his head borrowed and he stopped all at once and he looked up in a tree and he said Zacchaeus come down out of that tree I'm going home with you today of all the people in the city of all the people in the city he picks him because of a wife at home because of the predestinated seed that fell in love with Jesus's ministry and she's prayed that God would get a hold of her husband brother brother Masood he knew his name he knew his heart and he's the same yesterday today and forever he's that same God here right now all brethren but this is just another service is it I want you to just notice brother Denny there's something about when you're in the presence of Jesus you know there sometimes you think well if I was in the presence of a a great man I'd like to ask him some questions and then all the sudden you you're there in your mind's blank a lot of people said that about being around brother branham they'd have a lot of questions about when they were in that presence everything was just blank you can't be in Jesus's presence and never ever be the same now I'm not talking about being the presence of a church and I'm not talking about being in the presence of a pastor or influence of a man I'm talking about being in the presence of Jesus but the brand would caution people in the presence of that angel now there's something standing between you and I listen it would change their life forever decades had passed and they lived maybe decades 50 60 years and they walk on the prayer line and and in that moment everything's different everything's different and in that moment when you meet Jesus and I'm talking about really meeting it you know I you know I've been around a while now and you see people do a lot of petty things and you get you you know sometimes you as an audience get real concerned about people you see things still hanging in their lives and trivial things are happening and they go this way that way it's because they haven't met Jesus but once you fall in love with Jesus it cleans you up always all those things still hanging on don't worry if they get in the presence of Jesus interchange their life you know what's wrong with American Europe right now they really didn't meet Jesus God sent him a prophet but they didn't meet Jesus and what's going on in the streets of America and our politics in the White House I take a pill they call it a pill at home why it's called truth pill I'll tell you what's going on I'm gonna use that pill just now we're reaping what we've sowed will reap in what we've sowed we've got precedents that don't know Jesus we've got statesmen that don't know Jesus they took this book out they decided they didn't need this in their schools or they don't mean it in their government and they sewed never gonna read there's no stopping it it's headed to a Tribulation Period it's headed to a Tribulation Period in there and that's where it's going but this message has built you for this hour my brother on my mind is so much on everything that's around hey listen don't get your eyes on that they're tearing down statues they're doing that in Europe they're doing that in the Philippines they're doing that all over the earth because it's a tribulation move it's the children of the wicked we're headed to a lawless Society and the reason we're headed to a lawless society is because they turned down Jesus and when you turn down the headship of the word before long you start throwing stones at the Prophet a few years ago they were throwing stones at brother branham and then they started tearing up their Bibles and then there's throwing stones at ministry now they're tearing down George Washington and Columbus Winston Churchill in Europe and they're tearing down all these statues all over the place but they're going to get a king you see there's two kings coming to the earth less two teens coming you thought I didn't have anything to do with this but there's two kings coming Jesus came under Zacchaeus history King was coming the intercessor was coming he's come today and King Jesus is coming back to earth again there's a broad that's waiting on him [Applause] but there's another king that's going to sit during the Tribulation Period and he's going to be king over this chaos are you with me you think it's chaos man you take this bride off of the earth you get a better get ready Jesus has come you better get ready Jesus is coming Zacchaeus went when he went when he when he had Jesus to his house he said Lord I if I if I robbed any I'll make it good I'll do anything I love that words I love that two more examples before we get into the scripture there was a woman that brother Branham talks about an incredible amount of time and especially in the unwelcome Christ and here's what brother Branham says she said I want the best alabaster box that you've got in this place I want the best cleats the money and when that man sees the money it's different now I want the best that you've got and here's what I want to say I want to give God the best I don't want to be this place to be ever be a place to where we come and they've become a social agenda this Father's Day let's rededicate our lives but I want this place to become a place like never before that Jesus is welcome here the Jesus of this message is welcomed here to live and this message is more than just a good recipe or a good formula you can know this message from the beginning from 47 to 65 and all the way back but if it don't live on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday I wanted to live I want to live and you may not be able to quote a quote but that doesn't matter let it live in your life he's worthy of the best Chris he's worthy of our best what do you do - for him give him you give him the leftover and you run around and you give him three minutes a night or before you go to bed he deserves your best he deserves everything that you've got what you what are you going to do about it he said give him everything you you just give him anything and he takes it he takes it anyway but she said I want the best he said it cost her everything and here's what I want to do with that quote on December the 22nd when God dealt with me he asked me for my life and we could talk about a lot of miracles that have happened in in our inner church here but on that visitation God asked me to trust him with my life my life Andrew last night my doing okay I missed something there sometimes we we trust him with our money but money comes and goes maybe we trust him with the car or a house but that'll it's temporary but when we're talking about our being here's what I here's what I missed sometimes when it's a friend or a family member or somebody that's real close to us it gets real close to the heart it gets real emotional but it makes a phenomenal amount of difference when it's you how many how many times have you heard I was listening to her to a prayer request that went across brother Donnie Reagan's pulpit the other night and it was a request about a person that was getting ready to be tested for cancer and then I heard it a prayer request for here and someone was here was getting ready to be tested for cancer and sister Mike walls she she's in between her biopsy now and and the test for cancer heme he's been in that boat before the test for cancer and then it's coming that dread can you attach with me that dread between that point and this point that two weeks or whatever it is it's phenomenal it's almost overwhelming and then the doctors report that says you have cancer how many's been there you can attach now going in and out of the Cancer Center has been very I remembered sister Connie walking off of the elevator and she just about the first time she just about hyperventilated which she saw everybody that was sitting there because in that moment it's come to your house remember that moment it's now at your house here here about eight weeks ago brother Nathaniel sister su you were there we were in the emergency department and they called the voice and they're telling us that we have brain cancer and sister Connie doubles her head between her legs she literally puts her head between her legs it's no longer on paper and walking the floor last week and walking down the aisle and the guy that's with me and we just begin to talk and he said well you you know it's spreading it just looks at me and he said it's just cancer I thought about this sermon that will only be a few more minutes but it's hot now here's what I want to say this to you we don't want pity we don't want you to feel sorry for us we want to tell you and I want to tell you this morning the doctors headed to my house [Music] said all right that's what I wanted to do it with I want to tell you he's left the boat I want to tell you there's a woman that has touched the hem of His garment and she was made whole I want to tell you that my messenger that was that had left the house and maybe you've give up and maybe you've thought it you know there's no hope I can only imagine Jarius as he's leaving the house and he looks over at his daughter and he's tried everything his religion hasn't worked out I remember in China it would be one of the last phenomenal meetings and I remember as I standing beside her brother Murphy Wang and I'm preaching and I'm preaching on Jesus has come to this house and it came and maybe you've thought it cabal has been written over the door and maybe you thought that you're dying and life's not going to go on anymore but Jesus is on his way and you may be at that spot this morning - were that you feel like this nobody can help me there's nobody that could turn this around for me I'm living in dispersed this way it's always gonna be let me just say put your hat on this morning and go find Jesus [Applause] [Music] when he looked over this little girl laying there maybe he thought in his own mind I've done the best as a father that I can do and here it is Father's Day but I've done everything that I can do for you baby doll and if this moment is the last goodbye honey I love you but I must it to Jesus Jesus Jesus [Applause] [Applause] no doubt critics were standing outside of his house were you going it didn't matter no doubt there was people there that was full of doubt but today they didn't matter no doubt there were people that were saying a lot of things but it don't matter all they've got it's just stuff to say but God does everything well Janice gets there in time to see a woman that it's been 12 years and in that moment the chemicals of her body changes that's more important than fishes and loaves that's more important than literally the water into wine the chemicals of her body changes and she walks into a service and says if I can touch the hem of His garment it don't matter who else is in the building I've just got to get to word that I can touch the hem of His garment I don't mean any further on the say anything to me I don't mean to call me by my name but if I can touch the hem of his garment if we would come with that kind of an expectation to the services and walk out the walk in these doors and put everything that we've got on the line for this service it will take care of those little problems in your home it will take care of those weaknesses that you've got from week to week to week to week to week if you just lay it all on the line they'll hold nothing back just lay it on the line and just say this service is going to change my life and when I leave here today I'm gonna be different I don't know what the service is gonna do for other people but when I sit in my peel touch the hem of this garment I'm gonna be well jesus knows who Jarius is cuz he knows who you are he don't need a real formal introduction he's the reason God always has a reason God always has a purpose he's always got a plan he's always got a plan sometimes we get all nervous about situations and you think well how is that ever going to be or he's got a plan he don't start and then quit now I won't be just a couple more minutes and Jesus is on his way and Jerry's is talking to the woman is healed and somebody comes and says don't trouble the master don't trouble it your daughter's dead Jesus can go somewhere else that he's needed this is important so I want to get it to you now Jesus knows that if I'm going to his house she's going to live so what this messenger has just come and told Jarius don't matter but Jarius is like Ron Spencer a lot of times sometimes you don't know the plan because you can't see way down the road and brother Joe you couldn't see the baby dedication this morning many years ago but God had a plan did you get that did you get that God's watching over his seed when you can't watch over them in your prayers sometimes you're praying this is ever gonna work out but God's got a plan and Jesus be not afraid be not afraid be not afraid isn't it awesome when God steadies us isn't it awesome when God just turns around to us and he tells us I got this some of you've been there done that you know what I'm saying right now I got this God sometimes does things for us that that it's just nice it's just nice you just go I'm prayed for things for years and it's and it all just all the sudden happens and then it's disco wasn't that nice what not just nice I got a ring on my finger it's my class ring and maybe it's the first time you've ever seen me wear it but I lost this ring about two years ago two three years ago and periodically I'll go look for it because there's times I just feel like there's tons I feel like what is where it's my class ring and it's it was it's made exactly like my mother's class ring and so I just like to wear it well I'd lost it and I searched the world over and I lost it and so Connie is going to give crystal a pocketbook I said okay I'll tell you that Toula and so it's gonna give her a pocketbook so she shakes it and she shakes it and she shakes it and that'll tell you how long it's been since she used it but she's shaking it and she's shaking it and she's shaking it this week and a lot of stuff falls out of it she puts her hand down in it and she runs it and and she comes hollering through the house look what I found [Applause] I put it on my finger and thought about what it meant for this week and I thought it meant nice because that which was lost now is found and the life that has left that little girl and seemed to have escaped her lungs and now her spirit is going out into the realm of the spirit world Jesus has got ahold of it and he knows how to bring it right back to her and put it right back in her body [Applause] hallelujah lujah and the God that note this trial before it ever began knows how to take the strength from Ron Spencer's body and reach and grab ahold of it and put it right back into that body [Applause] but the joshan are great difficulty to thumb Jesus in a great difficulty to find Jesus sometimes we have to go through some desperate things and sometimes we lose our strength and even lose our way I don't know how to eat this this this pit is will be but brother Nathanael we will all agree that Jesus is on his way and he's all he's waiting more than just my house and I wrote this note down this week early in the morning and I want to share it with you if I get to a spot to wear that I can't remember my name somebody take a hold of my hand and get me to Jesus will you make me that promise I must get to Jesus amen Andrew could you sing that song again he's in the house now I want to just close if I could with this and thank you for being such a wonderful audience unconscious that you are thinking about my need and even yours but really what about your need why don't you just call your name now your situation why don't you just lay everything on the line no matter where you're out if it's in the Philippines it's in Europe sister Pascal sister Christine sister Johnson with cancer the needs that are coming in all over the world it seems like such a simple thing but what about about your relationships don't you put God first and everything in your life young man young lady there's nothing worth putting in front of Jesus let me just say there's the world is falling apart it's like falling off of a cliff and many people are reaching and grabbing whatever rock that they can get or but let me just say there's no answer in the earth but Jesus and there's a lot of people think I'm preaching a simple sermon when it's way beyond anything that they can get because a lot of people saw we and Brenham and they didn't see Jesus and there's a lot of people see our favorite preachers and how well they preach but they don't see Jesus and Andrew I want them to not just hear your fiery sermon but I want them to see Jesus and at the end of the day all the sermons that are preached in my life they don't mean nothing unless they've seen Jesus life means nothing unless you met him I love you with all my heart with all my heart amen could we pray just before and maybe today you'd like to just say there's been a little things in my life that I really need to lay down need to commit [Music] he's here now he said he'd be here he can you've been a very aware that he's only inches away from you even in a Pew due to restrictions we can't have an altar call but would you let him come to your altar now of your heart that's right that's right now let it be the emotional journey let it touch your life right there at the Pew you feel him sweeping over you he's not he's not even inches away from the assists would you just let him do a work for you Rodman oh Jesus let me touch your garment Jesus you're welcome at my house Jesus touch my life Lord look right straight through me you see me the way [Music] but the Bisco said he said he'd look like he was looking right through you why don't you just let him look right through you in this moment why don't you just let him search every Avenue and in this moment say father clean every closet clean ever Avenue to clean every music chamber clean every spirit out of my life clean every contaminant that I picked up clean everything out of my life Oh God Almighty God we passed the feebleness of my humanity now your presence has come into this building even now and I ask you that you would go to every home every life every soul that is standing here not only the ones present but the ones that are in the unseen [Music] Jarius steady yourself now don't fear [Music] don't fear if we could just hear Jesus say these words I got this thought you told me in this sermon once again in this sermon you've told me that you've got this you've told the preacher this morning I've got this I needed the servant you know my name I can know every quote in every scripture I can be visited by angels but there's none like you when you come to our homes it's not like you that when you change molecules of our body and we can walk out of a building completely whole hallelujah father I watched you only a seconds ago sweep across his audience troubles in marriages and you reminded us I got that relationships I got that stand in the sinner spirit I got that may you clean up the music chambers of people's lives gaining sinners of demons of people's lives Lord of the holiness of people's lives oh god I pray that you clear mind and cleaner spirit from live in a life that we might be rapture ready we're identified for rapture come on cleanse us steady ester god father I don't need to get to a precedent I don't mean to get to my favorite preacher I need to get you to you I don't need to get to the president I don't need to get to my favorite preacher I need to get to you and get into you it's the most important thing in the whole thank you Father decades ago people would travel 20 hours 30 hours to stand outside of a building because brother Branham was preaching I want to tell you why that would happen [Music] if your name was called you'd never be the same all he's in this room he's in this room and group many of those people didn't have the money to do what they were doing they borrowed the money the bar at the money and they drove 20 hours and they didn't have her I didn't have the money to get in her to get into a hotel and they slapping appears because they had an expectation that angel of the Lord would would turn their way their whole life would be changed their baby would live they got an ambulances that woman that Andrew talked about last night said if I can get to the healer I'll find my daddy and she grabbed another param bhavam the pole when she found out who he was I want to tell you now he's here and I say that by the authority of the word of the Lord he's in this room right now [Music] you hallelujah the important one came today not Ron Spencer but the important one is standing here he was standing in my room a couple weeks ago and he told me see poss what you see they pass what you think and when I stood up and he stood behind me

change the way you look at life if you just touch him if you just touch it brother Nathaniel you remember what he touched you do you remember when it touched it only took one time [Music] won't you

before your great presence Lord right now you have stepped into this dimension Oh God Lord Jesus to catch us up father to take us into your thoughts Lord that we would no longer think our thoughts but we would think what you think of God and if you cared enough to go to a little girl how much more do you care to go by the way of the bride this morning if you cared enough to go by the way of the gardener's how much do you care to go by the Queen of heavens way this morning Lord Jesus I pray that you'd see across this audience your greater high is upon them Oh God I pray that you turn your eye

Great God who was a great God that will ever forever be thanked God that will not change when the winds of change flow but I hear a sound in the mulberry trees there's a wind that's a crumb and that's looping over this place just now to take us into the realm of the heavenlies and we may no longer see what we see in the natural but cedar that supernatural realm catches up father into the dimension of God that you caused us oblivion not in this petty world of Layana senior get your son father there's been a rock thrown in the cave this morning to stir ourselves to shake our faith to let it loose
