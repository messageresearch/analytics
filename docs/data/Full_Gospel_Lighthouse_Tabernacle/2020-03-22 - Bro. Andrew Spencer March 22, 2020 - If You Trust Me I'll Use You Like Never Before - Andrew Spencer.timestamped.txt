[54:38] goodness towards us and we just
[54:41] appreciate each and every one of you by
[54:43] by the way of prayer we feel your
[54:45] prayers this morning lifting us up and
[54:48] standing with us in the gap and we know
[54:50] that there is one greater that is with
[54:53] us and we can see and he's told us where
[54:55] two or three are gathered we thank you
[54:57] for assembling yourselves together in
[55:00] your homes today we thank you for for
[55:02] the cheer the children of God that have
[55:04] gathered here to make these things
[55:06] available and God has been with us
[55:08] through every step of the way and so
[55:11] we're very thankful to be standing in
[55:13] this moment and be standing with you and
[55:16] so we we bring you greetings from our
[55:18] pastor this morning
[55:19] he is home and is recovering from the
[55:23] surgeries that he's had and so we're so
[55:26] thankful that that God has brought him
[55:28] through again and I'd like to show a
[55:31] share a picture with you if that's okay
[55:38] hey man that right there is a champion a
[55:43] champion of champions and there's his
[55:47] queen with him amen we thank the Lord
[55:50] for our pastor and pastor's wife and
[55:52] we're just very appreciative of the good
[55:55] things that the Lord has done and I say
[55:57] boo devil I say boo devil God has God
[56:01] has won another victory Satan came in
[56:04] for another blow this past week and and
[56:06] blood clots were found in his lungs and
[56:09] legs
[56:09] and the doctors were able to put in a
[56:12] screen and and to see those things and
[56:14] brother on is feeling better they went
[56:17] ahead with the Gamma Knife radiation
[56:19] procedure they were going to hold off
[56:21] but dealing with what he is dealing with
[56:23] and what where we are in the world they
[56:26] wanted to go ahead and move forward with
[56:27] those things and I believe that the
[56:29] prayers of the Saints move those things
[56:32] forward and the angel of the Lord
[56:34] protected him and preserved his life
[56:36] again and his brother Matthew has said
[56:39] this morning we're expecting nothing but
[56:41] full victory and we're going to come out
[56:43] on the winning side of these things and
[56:45] so we just appreciate you being with us
[56:48] today
[56:49] and we thank you for taking the time to
[56:52] be a part of this service lifting up
[56:54] your hands and worshiping and I pray
[56:57] that the angel the Lord would go by your
[56:59] address today and physically be there
[57:01] present with you to comfort you and
[57:03] strengthen you in this hour this will be
[57:06] our service schedule until until further
[57:09] notice eleven o'clock on Sundays and we
[57:13] just appreciate the Lord for protecting
[57:16] us we know that the Bible tells us that
[57:17] though there'll be no plague that will
[57:20] come now that dwelling and we plead the
[57:22] blood of Jesus Christ so husbands
[57:24] fathers I admonish you to apply the
[57:27] blood the token life of Jesus Christ
[57:30] across her family's life across your
[57:32] home like never before it is your duty
[57:35] as the husband as the head of the home
[57:37] to make sure that the blood is applied
[57:39] and to make sure that the token of
[57:41] Christ is is over the doorpost of every
[57:44] one of your hearts and so this is a time
[57:46] like never before to listen to the
[57:48] message and if you do not have way of
[57:51] streaming or not have the ability to be
[57:54] able to stream different different
[57:56] archives like brother Donny's and

[57:59] admonish you if you're viewing this with
[58:02] your family and do not have the ability
[58:04] to go back and look over archives and
[58:06] streams listen to this message like
[58:08] never before but I would admonish you to
[58:11] listen to the last five services that
[58:14] brother Branham preached I believe that
[58:16] God is speaking special things to us in
[58:18] those moments and so to go back and
[58:20] study over those sayings and
[58:22] to indulge in things of God for I
[58:25] believe God is speaking to us and I
[58:26] believe God will speak to us today we
[58:28] thank you for for all those that have
[58:31] sent in their tithes to the address
[58:33] there that we had provided we appreciate
[58:36] those things and we know that God is
[58:38] blessing you for that so we pray that
[58:40] the the abundance of the Lord would pour
[58:42] out his blessings upon you and so we
[58:45] have so appreciate that and for your
[58:47] giving unto the Lord and so we just want

[1:04:16] amen if you would take your Bibles this
[1:04:20] morning and turn with us over to the
[1:04:22] Book of Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 1
[1:04:27] this morning as you're turning through
[1:04:32] the Leafs of your pages of the Bible
[1:04:34] they're flipping through the pages and
[1:04:38] the promises of God just now I'd like to
[1:04:40] speak to you on a thought that was
[1:04:44] spoken by the Lord to our pastor brother
[1:04:48] Ron Spencer on the morning of December
[1:04:52] the 22nd before we ever got into the
[1:04:55] midst of the battle and before things
[1:04:58] begin to get heated our Lord Jesus
[1:05:01] Christ spoke these words to our pastor
[1:05:07] but Iran has relayed these things to us
[1:05:10] several times ministers around the world
[1:05:13] heard these things God's placed it on my
[1:05:17] heart this morning to speak to you these
[1:05:20] words is what the Lord spoke brother Ron
[1:05:24] said that when he spoke he spoke like a
[1:05:26] gentleman and he said if you'll trust me
[1:05:30] I'll use you like never before if you
[1:05:37] trust me I'll use you like a never
[1:05:39] before this morning this sermon makes me
[1:05:43] anxious not in a fearful way but in it
[1:05:49] victorious anxiousness I am anxious to
[1:05:52] see what God is willing and wanting to
[1:05:55] do I do not believe that these things
[1:06:00] were spoken pertinently pertinently to
[1:06:02] brother on just for himself but I
[1:06:05] believe that they are spoken to us as
[1:06:07] his children and the bride of Jesus
[1:06:09] Christ that we've seen mighty victories
[1:06:13] in the past we've seen supernatural
[1:06:16] things happen in the past we've seen
[1:06:18] them happen this week but the bride of
[1:06:21] Jesus Christ I ask that you hear me this
[1:06:24] morning
[1:06:24] I do not want this to be just another
[1:06:27] sermon but an anthem to you that if you
[1:06:31] trust him he will use you like never
[1:06:35] before
[1:06:37] Isaiah chapter 26 and verse 1 in that
[1:06:42] day shall this song be sung in the land
[1:06:45] of Judah we have a strong City salvation
[1:06:51] will got a point four walls and Bohr
[1:06:52] walks open ye the gates that the
[1:06:56] righteous nation which keepeth the truth
[1:06:59] may enter in I love these words now
[1:07:03] we'll keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:07:05] mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:07:09] trusted in thee and that is why you can
[1:07:12] have perfect peace is because you're
[1:07:15] trusting in the author of life verse 4
[1:07:20] trust ye in the Lord trust she in
[1:07:23] Jehovah trusts you in Hell Oh him
[1:07:26] forever not just in the battle not just
[1:07:30] in despair not just in the time of
[1:07:32] trouble but forever trust she in the
[1:07:36] Lord for in the Lord Jehovah is
[1:07:39] everlasting strength for he bringeth
[1:07:42] down them that dwell on high the lofty
[1:07:46] city he lay if it low he lay if it low
[1:07:48] even to the ground he brings it to the
[1:07:50] dust the foot shall tread it down even
[1:07:54] the feet of the poor and the steps of
[1:07:57] the needy may be just where you're
[1:08:00] standing at if you have a need by the
[1:08:02] way of lifting up your hand and the by
[1:08:05] the way of prayer lift your hands not
[1:08:07] before a man but before the great I am
[1:08:09] who is omniscient omnipresent and
[1:08:12] omnipotent and lift your needs and lift
[1:08:15] out your voices this morning to the
[1:08:18] great I am who will answer your cry
[1:08:20] Heavenly Father we come to you this
[1:08:23] morning Lord in the spirit of humility
[1:08:26] and the spirit of worship father we come
[1:08:28] before you lord and your August presence
[1:08:31] is ever so near to us in these moments
[1:08:33] father Lord we may not have as
[1:08:36] as needed father as the many as we
[1:08:39] normally would but father we have
[1:08:41] exactly what is needed today to bring
[1:08:43] your presence down where you said where
[1:08:45] two or three are gathered in our own
[1:08:47] assemblies at home and our own
[1:08:49] assemblies at church here this morning
[1:08:51] we feel your presence more because your
[1:08:54] promised word told us that you'll not
[1:08:56] leave us nor forsake us and father there
[1:08:59] are there are many afflictions that have
[1:09:01] come by though or axises way there's
[1:09:04] many diseases that have come by the
[1:09:05] righteous way but your the Lord our God
[1:09:08] that delivers us from all of them and
[1:09:10] Father we're just asking Lord just now
[1:09:13] Lord that you would hear our cry for the
[1:09:15] blood of Jesus Christ father you see the
[1:09:18] needs that we have father you see the
[1:09:20] uplifted hands father just now Lord
[1:09:23] those that are shuddhi and father lord
[1:09:25] these are not the way that we expect
[1:09:27] things to go but father this is how you
[1:09:30] have this is how that you have led us in
[1:09:32] this hour and I pray that you'd comfort
[1:09:35] every heart and every need just now go
[1:09:37] by their way and may the wind of the
[1:09:40] Holy Ghost set is moving in this place
[1:09:42] moved by their home just now and
[1:09:44] minister to them in life and peace and
[1:09:47] health O God and may they not fear
[1:09:49] father for they know that the one that
[1:09:52] is walking on the water is the son of
[1:09:54] man that that has come to bring
[1:09:56] deliverance and to come to bring victory
[1:09:58] and to bring peace to the storm of life
[1:10:01] father I pray that as these words are
[1:10:04] spoken this morning that you would be
[1:10:06] glorified and magnified in our midst
[1:10:09] bless the word today bless your children
[1:10:11] anoint us in the name of Jesus Christ we
[1:10:14] pray amen god bless you this morning as
[1:10:19] we said we like to speak to you this
[1:10:21] morning by the help of the Lord that if
[1:10:23] you'll trust me I'll use you like never
[1:10:27] before
[1:10:29] brother Branham said that if I wasn't
[1:10:31] for Jesus I'd be here against him God
[1:10:34] grant the day when men and women will be
[1:10:37] what they say they are
[1:10:38] if you're a Christian live like it be
[1:10:41] like it act like it if you're not be
[1:10:43] against it so people will know where
[1:10:46] you're standing if I didn't believe it
[1:10:48] I'd be against it but I'm willing to
[1:10:50] my soul on any phase of that word on any
[1:10:54] face of that word to say that its truth
[1:10:56] I believe that it's the inspired Word of
[1:10:59] God and I believe that every word of it
[1:11:02] it's inspired and I'm willing to trust
[1:11:04] my life now that's a huge statement in
[1:11:08] every spot and every walk of life that
[1:11:10] I'm willing to trust my life anytime on
[1:11:13] God's Word and his promise for it is
[1:11:16] true we live in a very uncertain time in
[1:11:19] a very uncertain age where things are
[1:11:21] changing but yet the Word of God is not
[1:11:24] changing and I love what the Bible tells
[1:11:27] us here in Isaiah to trust you in the
[1:11:29] Lord forever you see the sense of it is
[1:11:32] that let your confidence in God on no
[1:11:35] occasion fail let your faith let your
[1:11:38] trust and in no occasion fail let no
[1:11:41] calamity let no distress no let no
[1:11:44] adversity no persecution no poverty no
[1:11:47] trial of any kind prevent your trust in
[1:11:50] him I love what the Prophet says when he
[1:11:53] speaks these things he speaks of the
[1:11:56] truth and he speaks of the strength and
[1:11:58] the power of God he does not mean power
[1:12:01] he does not mean power which is not
[1:12:03] being used or that is unemployed but a
[1:12:06] power of Almighty God that is active
[1:12:09] that is energetic which is actually
[1:12:12] being exerted upon you his children in
[1:12:14] these moments which is exactly it is
[1:12:17] exerted to you in your need and the
[1:12:20] power and the strength of the Lord is
[1:12:22] forever
[1:12:23] and it's not changing it's not moving
[1:12:25] it's not backing up God is moving
[1:12:27] forward people may be backing up the
[1:12:30] government may be backing up science may
[1:12:33] be backing up but God's not backing up
[1:12:35] and he is exerting that power towards
[1:12:38] his children and which he is going to
[1:12:41] bring about and expect it in its an
[1:12:43] everlasting strength it's an almighty
[1:12:45] strength it's an omnipotent strength
[1:12:47] because he's God it's God it's not man's
[1:12:50] power it's God's power he's not changing
[1:12:53] he's not moving he's not backing up and
[1:12:56] our faith ought to rise to the challenge
[1:12:58] this morning it ought to move to the
[1:13:01] challenge of the word to move
[1:13:03] all the continued advances of the enemy
[1:13:06] that have Baden have beaten us and have
[1:13:08] come and buffeted us our faith ought to
[1:13:11] rise above the challenge of the enemy
[1:13:13] i'faith ought to rise above all the
[1:13:15] circumstances that we're going through
[1:13:16] no matter what it is God is not changing
[1:13:20] for neither the truth nor his justice
[1:13:23] nor his power nor his goodness is
[1:13:25] temporary or feeding or fading away but
[1:13:28] God continues to always be God we live
[1:13:33] in an hour of lay on a seal where things
[1:13:35] are constantly changing it's a day of
[1:13:37] people's rights but it seems like the
[1:13:40] people's rights are being taken away
[1:13:41] from them but here this thing has not
[1:13:44] caught God off-guard
[1:13:45] God knows exactly where we're standing
[1:13:47] at he knows exactly what we're going
[1:13:50] through and what we're facing and we can
[1:13:54] trust in this God we can believe in this
[1:13:57] God we can accept his power and his
[1:14:00] truth towards us
[1:14:01] Dwight Moody's favorite verse throughout
[1:14:04] the whole Bible was Isaiah twelve and
[1:14:06] two and he said that I will trust the
[1:14:09] Bible says I will trust and not be
[1:14:11] afraid and the white moody would say
[1:14:13] that he would say that you can travel
[1:14:16] first-class or you can travel
[1:14:18] second-class to heaven he said second
[1:14:21] class is what time I am afraid I would
[1:14:23] trust but first class is that I would
[1:14:26] trust and not be afraid that is the
[1:14:29] better way why not buy a first-class
[1:14:30] ticket this morning why not buy a
[1:14:34] first-class ticket this morning that
[1:14:36] instead of in the hour of update of 12
[1:14:39] more trust in him but in before you ever
[1:14:42] get in that battle trust in him before
[1:14:44] you get in despair trust in him I
[1:14:46] believe that the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:48] has a first-class ticket all the way to
[1:14:51] glory and there's not going to be one
[1:14:53] circumstance there's not one to be one
[1:14:55] sickness there's not going to be one
[1:14:57] virus there's not going to be anything
[1:14:59] that stands between her and our
[1:15:01] first-class ticket all the way through
[1:15:04] the rapture the word trust is confidence
[1:15:08] it's a reliance arresting of the mind on
[1:15:11] the integrity of the veracity
[1:15:14] or justice of a friendship of a of
[1:15:16] another sound principle of a person so
[1:15:20] if you say that you trust somebody you
[1:15:22] are trusting in the integrity of that
[1:15:24] person the justice of that person the
[1:15:27] roar acity of that person and the
[1:15:29] principles of that person I'd say that
[1:15:32] jesus is a god that we can trust in this
[1:15:34] morning for the bible tells us in
[1:15:38] proverbs 29 that he put if his trust in
[1:15:40] the lord he that putteth his trust in
[1:15:43] the lord shall be safe what a thing to
[1:15:47] think about this morning in the hour
[1:15:49] that we're facing that that they that
[1:15:52] put their trust in the lord shall be
[1:15:54] safe when the world is afraid in the
[1:15:57] world is panicking it shows that there's
[1:16:00] no birth when they're panicking but the
[1:16:02] bride of Jesus Christ is relaxing and
[1:16:05] resting and waiting in that promise of
[1:16:08] God trust is he or that which is the
[1:16:14] ground of confidence the ground of
[1:16:17] confidence and the Bible says in Psalm
[1:16:20] 71 for the how are my hope God is the
[1:16:24] ground of confidence Oh Lord God thou
[1:16:27] aren't my trust from my youth and I'll
[1:16:30] think about these things that we have
[1:16:31] looked at as a church from 20/20 since
[1:16:34] the beginning of the year that that God
[1:16:36] is with us that God is with us and we
[1:16:39] will see miracles and throughout these
[1:16:43] past three months we have seen miracles
[1:16:45] transpire in front of us and I think
[1:16:49] that it's so amazing and I think that we
[1:16:52] as the people of God need to catch what
[1:16:54] is really taking place here I believe
[1:16:57] that that while the world is shifting
[1:16:59] and changing we ought to have our eyes
[1:17:01] on one person and that's none other than
[1:17:04] Jesus Christ one that ain't changing
[1:17:07] there's no variableness in him
[1:17:09] there's perfection in him but we look at
[1:17:12] these things that we look as everything
[1:17:15] is transpiring in Tom how that
[1:17:17] everything is moving
[1:17:19] moving into God's plan and here we are
[1:17:22] and we're watching these things
[1:17:24] transpire and we're watching the
[1:17:26] miracles of God happen right in front of
[1:17:29] us and I'm asking you as a church do not
[1:17:32] take these things lightly this is God
[1:17:35] preparing you for a body change when you
[1:17:38] look at the miracle when you look at the
[1:17:40] miracle of babies walking when you look
[1:17:43] at the miracles of hair that is growing
[1:17:45] back on the head that has never came
[1:17:47] back upon a head when you look at sister
[1:17:49] Mariah Pruitt and you look at sister
[1:17:52] Esther when it was looking impossible
[1:17:54] for a miracle to take place then God
[1:17:57] stepped in I want you to know your faith
[1:18:00] may rest in this God today you can rest
[1:18:03] in this God because he's a God that
[1:18:05] keeps his promises
[1:18:07] he's a God that won't let you down you
[1:18:09] may be shut in at home but you can count
[1:18:12] on God you may get lonely but God's air
[1:18:15] you may get tired of being alone but
[1:18:17] God's there you don't have to be shook
[1:18:20] up and worried and panicking you can
[1:18:23] rest in the promises of God because
[1:18:25] Almighty God said that I will be a
[1:18:27] comfort to you hallelujah you look at
[1:18:32] all these things that are transpiring
[1:18:34] through the Battle of this camp so that
[1:18:36] has come against our pastor I hate to
[1:18:40] even say that word but I want you to
[1:18:42] know this hell I want you to know this
[1:18:45] that it will be a pleasure for us as the
[1:18:48] bride of Jesus Christ to help throw you
[1:18:50] into the lake of fire you may be
[1:18:54] attacking us now but you will be to feed
[1:18:58] it you cannot conquer us you cannot
[1:19:00] defeat us you cannot destroy us but we
[1:19:03] will destroy you we will destroy you we
[1:19:09] look at these things and it looks like
[1:19:12] Satan would stop you from coming to
[1:19:14] church and stop you from worshipping
[1:19:16] he's tried to come in with a little
[1:19:18] sucker punch as it were and try to make
[1:19:21] you stay at home and not go to church
[1:19:23] but God still got through you see that
[1:19:26] maybe a virus had a circling the world
[1:19:29] but God's purpose
[1:19:30] and it's promised we'll still get
[1:19:32] through and I want to put hell on notice
[1:19:34] this morning you will not be able to
[1:19:36] stop the bride of Jesus Christ you will
[1:19:39] not be able to make us waver because our
[1:19:41] faith is not what we can see our faith
[1:19:44] is in the unseen around our faith is in
[1:19:47] Almighty God my faith is in the promise
[1:19:50] my faith is in Almighty God that will
[1:19:52] bring his promises to pass he star he's
[1:19:57] not changing he's a God that we can
[1:19:59] trust in and we trusted him all the way
[1:20:02] through every battle and he's had his
[1:20:05] hand upon you all throughout your life
[1:20:08] he's had his hand upon you you've
[1:20:11] watched him as you watch him as he
[1:20:13] ministered to you in your life he spoke
[1:20:15] to you in your life but now he is saying
[1:20:18] to you if you trust me I will use you
[1:20:23] like a never before notice the power of
[1:20:28] that question that if you trust me
[1:20:30] little bride you've had victories in the
[1:20:34] past you've had powerful times in the
[1:20:37] past you've had anointing in the past
[1:20:40] you've had strength in the past you've
[1:20:42] had none other than me in your realm but
[1:20:45] if you trust me through all of this
[1:20:48] chaos I will use you like never before I
[1:20:52] want to tell you to get ready get ready
[1:20:56] for the promises of God get ready for
[1:20:59] the things that are getting ready to
[1:21:00] transpire and watch for Jesus watch for
[1:21:04] him the Bible says in proverbs three and
[1:21:08] five trusts in the Lord with all thine
[1:21:11] heart and lean not unto thine own
[1:21:13] understanding in all thy ways
[1:21:15] acknowledge him and he shall direct my
[1:21:18] plans in all thy ways acknowledge him
[1:21:21] acknowledge him in the morning
[1:21:23] acknowledge him in the evening
[1:21:24] acknowledge him in good times
[1:21:26] acknowledge him in victory acknowledge
[1:21:29] him when it seems like you're in defeat
[1:21:31] acknowledge him in pain acknowledge him
[1:21:33] in health acknowledge the Lord God
[1:21:35] Almighty and all thy ways he will direct
[1:21:38] thy paths live in an hour we're where we
[1:21:42] are
[1:21:43] where we're living in a spot where
[1:21:45] everybody's self-confident and relying
[1:21:47] upon themselves
[1:21:48] everybody's confident in themselves and
[1:21:51] where they're at and they're there
[1:21:52] they're confident in their monies
[1:21:54] they're confident in their 401ks
[1:21:56] well that was till two weeks ago they're
[1:21:59] no longer confident they don't know
[1:22:00] what's coming they don't understand
[1:22:02] what's shifting they don't understand
[1:22:04] what's causing this or what's driving
[1:22:06] this but I believe that with all of my
[1:22:09] heart that this is Satan trying to stop
[1:22:12] the move of God I believe that with
[1:22:15] everything that's within me that he's
[1:22:17] trying to stop the move of God but he
[1:22:19] will not stop us from worshiping in our
[1:22:23] homes worshiping in our cars worshiping
[1:22:26] in our life applying the blood of Jesus
[1:22:28] Christ we're not confident ourselves
[1:22:30] we're confident in the blood your immune
[1:22:34] system may get weak but he don't get
[1:22:36] weak for in the time of trouble I will
[1:22:40] hide you in my pavilion
[1:22:42] I'm not comforted in my own house I'm
[1:22:45] comforted in his word that has housed me
[1:22:48] in this blood sale of the blood of Jesus
[1:22:51] Christ we're not relying upon ourselves
[1:22:55] we're relying on God the life of God we
[1:22:58] have it there as simply no confidence
[1:23:01] that you could have in your flesh your
[1:23:03] flesh will let you down
[1:23:04] your flesh world your flesh it'll make
[1:23:08] you it'll make you uncertain of what
[1:23:10] you're going through as you get older
[1:23:12] you'll find out that your flesh will let
[1:23:15] you down you won't be able to do the
[1:23:16] activities that you once did as you get
[1:23:19] older in time but you know that brother
[1:23:23] Branham said that God trusted Moses and
[1:23:26] him being a prophet Moses being a
[1:23:30] prophet of the Lord God trusted Moses
[1:23:34] but God did not trust the flesh part he
[1:23:38] trusted the God part in Moses you see
[1:23:41] because even Moses being a prophet had
[1:23:45] mistakes he had mistakes but God was not
[1:23:48] trusting in the flesh he was trusting in
[1:23:52] what he deposited on me and
[1:23:54] out of him because you look in the book
[1:23:56] of Exodus and you see the things that
[1:23:58] Moses did Moses had a temper
[1:24:00] God didn't trust in that Moses Moses he
[1:24:04] was told by God to Moses that to go and
[1:24:08] speak to the rock and Moses smooth the
[1:24:10] rock twice you see what you've got Moses
[1:24:13] doing that which is a type of smiting
[1:24:16] the rock and Moses smites it twice you
[1:24:19] see what you've got it doing you've got
[1:24:21] it beaten Christ twice you don't have to
[1:24:24] be Christ twice for your human
[1:24:26] he's already healed too when he took
[1:24:28] those straps a pilot's judgment all that
[1:24:31] was enough but God was not trusting in
[1:24:35] the flesh he was trusting in what he has
[1:24:38] deposited in his germ seed of life now
[1:24:44] notice this that's what got the church
[1:24:46] in trouble today it's too many educated
[1:24:48] preachers without being born of the
[1:24:50] Spirit men and women like to listen to
[1:24:53] intellectual speeches and instead of the
[1:24:56] preaching of the power and the
[1:24:58] resurrection of Jesus Christ that's
[1:25:01] what's got us all in trouble today we
[1:25:03] don't need anything more we don't need
[1:25:05] any more high school education for
[1:25:07] preachers we need God called me and
[1:25:11] that's filled with the Holy Spirit and
[1:25:12] not some man-made theology and some
[1:25:15] denomination we need God called me God
[1:25:19] called men not so not solely resting
[1:25:22] upon yourself but God called me you know
[1:25:25] in your own self when you met him and
[1:25:27] when the change came and you're no
[1:25:29] longer relying on the old man you're
[1:25:31] relying on what he deposited the Bible
[1:25:36] says in Romans nine eleven and here we
[1:25:38] watch this for the children being not
[1:25:41] yet born neither having done any good or
[1:25:44] evil that the purpose of God according
[1:25:46] to election might stand not a works but
[1:25:49] of him that calleth you see it was by
[1:25:52] election that his purpose might stand in
[1:25:54] the predetermined plan of God he
[1:25:57] foreknew every attribute of you and it's
[1:26:00] his purpose that it would stand in this
[1:26:02] hour and nothing can defeat his purpose
[1:26:07] his covenant was not destroyed when Adam
[1:26:09] fell nor when he failed it was not
[1:26:12] destroyed in catch gone off guard
[1:26:14] God seen what would take place God seen
[1:26:17] what would transpire and your mistakes
[1:26:19] does not change God's attitude towards
[1:26:23] you and what he thinks about you God
[1:26:25] can't love you no more and God can't
[1:26:27] love you no less you see you're always
[1:26:30] going to have human mistakes but God
[1:26:33] does not annoy his covenant towards you
[1:26:36] you see your choices your free moral
[1:26:38] agency will take you away from God but
[1:26:41] your election come on somebody your
[1:26:44] election will draw you to God you see
[1:26:49] it's not him that will ignore him that
[1:26:51] runneth but it's God that shows mercy
[1:26:53] it's not he that understands nor his
[1:26:56] ability you can't trust in yourself you
[1:26:59] can't trust in your abilities to sing
[1:27:01] you can't trust in your abilities the
[1:27:03] briques you can't trust in your flesh
[1:27:05] but there is an election your flesh will
[1:27:09] not get you in a rapture but there's a
[1:27:11] germ seed of God that will put you in
[1:27:13] the rapture when we see national force
[1:27:17] pushing this way but we see God pushing
[1:27:20] upward these are the things of God the
[1:27:25] Prophet said why do you trust in the
[1:27:26] flesh of horses and why do you trust in
[1:27:29] atomic power
[1:27:30] why do you trust in the things of this
[1:27:32] world and your houses in your places in
[1:27:34] your position take God at its work and
[1:27:38] write all through the atoms yonder into
[1:27:42] the spheres calendars into the heavens
[1:27:45] and whatever God is promised I love this
[1:27:49] God would you can ride on the atoms of
[1:27:55] those words because God will bring you
[1:27:57] to that spot that he's ordained you to
[1:27:59] be there's been many of things that have
[1:28:03] happened in your life that looked like
[1:28:04] it was going to stop you from being
[1:28:06] where you are as a son as a daughter of
[1:28:09] God but just keep riding on that word
[1:28:11] there may be sickness come that you keep
[1:28:14] riding on that word that maybe Tomos
[1:28:16] come there maybe letdowns come there may
[1:28:18] be Deaf sitcom but you keep riding on
[1:28:21] that word family may leave you but God
[1:28:24] will leave him Tom may fail you but God
[1:28:27] will fail you circumstances were changed
[1:28:30] but God won't change hallelujah
[1:28:33] when you look over in the Bible you see
[1:28:36] Amram and you hear the prophet as he's
[1:28:39] watching this whole thing transpire
[1:28:41] before him how that Amram is praying and
[1:28:45] hem ramus is there in the promise has
[1:28:48] been given to Abraham and his seed after
[1:28:50] him that there would come a deliverer
[1:28:53] that would deliver them from the hand of
[1:28:55] the enemy of the Egyptians mram was
[1:29:00] steady before God he was willing to
[1:29:04] stand there in front of the all the
[1:29:06] opposition being beaten making bricks
[1:29:10] but he still trusted what God had said
[1:29:14] and the Prophet watches as this
[1:29:18] transpires before him that ham Rams
[1:29:21] they're praying to God and all of a
[1:29:24] sudden the angel Gabriel steps into that
[1:29:28] realm where mram can watch him watch him
[1:29:31] as he starts speaking to him and he says
[1:29:33] hammer ahem I've seen you in your prayer
[1:29:36] you've been faithful you've been a
[1:29:38] blessing you've been have you been
[1:29:40] watching for the promise and I'm sending
[1:29:42] you and Joseph bad the promise you see
[1:29:46] Ameren was not trusting in his own flesh
[1:29:49] he was trusting in what God had said
[1:29:52] that God would send a deliverer that he
[1:29:55] bring him out with a mighty hand and
[1:29:58] hear the angel come and says I've heard
[1:30:03] her prayers and he runs down to the
[1:30:06] steps and he tells Joseph men and the
[1:30:10] Prophet said look at Joe Sabet how
[1:30:13] beautiful she was
[1:30:16] Joseph bad and Ameren start conversing
[1:30:19] over these Saints that these are the
[1:30:21] things that we've been looking for
[1:30:23] I can imagine as they begin to weep over
[1:30:26] these things and all of a sudden she
[1:30:29] asked
[1:30:30] Amram what did the angel look
[1:30:32] and he starts describing to her - what
[1:30:35] the angel looks like and he says honey
[1:30:40] we can trusted him
[1:30:41] you see days before he had been beaten
[1:30:45] he'd been making bricks and he was
[1:30:47] trusting in the promise but when he went
[1:30:50] out the next morning to go make more
[1:30:51] bricks
[1:30:52] he was still trusting in that promise
[1:30:54] but he was singing from a different spot
[1:30:57] you see he had trusted him before and he
[1:31:01] knew that God was going to use him like
[1:31:03] never before and held of his loins came
[1:31:07] a deliverer all parents do you realize
[1:31:11] that if you're standing on the promises
[1:31:13] of God that your children if you put
[1:31:16] before them this token that they will
[1:31:19] not forget the things that you have said
[1:31:21] and you may be used in one way but you
[1:31:24] will be used in a wholly different way
[1:31:27] through your children he's going to use
[1:31:29] you like never before he's going to
[1:31:31] bless you like never before he's going
[1:31:35] to anoint you like never before he's
[1:31:37] going to speak to you like never before
[1:31:39] who he's going to bless the children of
[1:31:43] God like never before

[1:31:51] are watching the transpiring of Egypt
[1:31:55] coming down on them the government
[1:31:57] coming down on them and they're pushed
[1:31:59] in isolation to hide their baby to hide
[1:32:03] the baby to hide the promise to hide the
[1:32:06] things that are happening around them
[1:32:08] and they have to push the promise they
[1:32:13] trusted in the word they've got the word
[1:32:16] they've got the promise and now they've
[1:32:18] got to push the promise out and they've
[1:32:21] got to trust this promise they've got to
[1:32:24] trust what the angel said and they push
[1:32:27] this treasure out of their heart when
[1:32:31] they push it out onto the LA River and
[1:32:33] the old crocodiles coming up I could see
[1:32:36] God

[1:39:37] and none of them that trust in him shall
[1:39:39] be desolate none of them that trust in
[1:39:42] him shall be guilty I say that some of
[1:39:45] you can give praise right there I'd say
[1:39:47] every person could give praise right
[1:39:49] there that those that trust in him shall
[1:39:52] not be desolate you will not be

[1:40:15] shake the world with your testimony not
[1:40:20] guilty not accuse not condemned
[1:40:26] hallelujah
[1:40:27] is that not what Paul told us there is
[1:40:30] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:40:34] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:40:36] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:40:39] you see if you're walking after the
[1:40:41] flesh you're still guilty if you're
[1:40:43] walking after the flesh you're still
[1:40:44] condemned but if you are walking after
[1:40:47] the spirit there's no condemnation to
[1:40:50] them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:40:52] Psalms 36 and 7 how excellent is thy
[1:40:56] loving-kindness O God therefore the
[1:40:59] children of men put their trust under
[1:41:01] the shadow of our wings some 62 and 8
[1:41:06] trust in him at all times in good times
[1:41:10] and bad times in a moment of a pandemic
[1:41:15] trust in him David said that I would
[1:41:18] bless the Lord at all times I will bless
[1:41:22] His Holy Name
[1:41:23] and
[1:41:24] will not forget his benefits trust in
[1:41:26] him at all times she people pour out
[1:41:29] your heart before him this is the time
[1:41:32] to pour out your heart before God this
[1:41:34] is a time to to rest in the promises of
[1:41:38] God for God is a refuge for us sell our
[1:41:43] brother branham said our actions show
[1:41:45] what we are if we say that we have faith
[1:41:49] and then afraid to step out and claim
[1:41:52] our faith and put it to work then our
[1:41:54] faith doesn't do us much good the Bible
[1:41:58] said that faith without works is dead
[1:41:59] just as the body without the Spirit is
[1:42:02] dead so faith without works is dead you
[1:42:09] see David was anointed before he ever
[1:42:12] got the battle and so have you been
[1:42:14] anointed by accepting what Eve has
[1:42:17] turned down you have been anointed in
[1:42:19] this Hauer
[1:42:20] but before David ever faced his Goliath
[1:42:23] David trusted in God he trusted in God
[1:42:27] when he faced the line he trusted in God
[1:42:29] when he faced the bear he trusted in God
[1:42:32] when his brothers told him that he was
[1:42:34] just coming down to watch the flight but
[1:42:36] the brothers didn't realize that he was
[1:42:38] going to be the one that carried out the
[1:42:40] victory and people may criticize you but
[1:42:43] you're going to be the ones that carry
[1:42:45] out the victory in this battle David
[1:42:50] trusted in God before he ever got in the
[1:42:53] valley before he went and spoke of Saul
[1:42:56] we trusted in God and God was going to
[1:43:00] use him like a never before you see
[1:43:04] before it ever it David ever got down
[1:43:07] there in the Valley of Elah he didn't
[1:43:11] have to pull out a measuring stick and
[1:43:12] find out how tall Goliath was how big
[1:43:17] his shekels were and his armor was he
[1:43:19] didn't have to figure out how long his
[1:43:20] finger was Goliath was proud about how
[1:43:23] big he was he was boasting how big he
[1:43:26] was a lot of people want to get caught
[1:43:29] up with how big Goliath was either way
[1:43:32] at the end of the road Goliath was dead
[1:43:36] they were still dead and don't matter
[1:43:38] how tall he is how sore he is no matter
[1:43:41] the demons that are facing you and car
[1:43:43] trying to conquer you trying to destroy
[1:43:46] you
[1:43:46] he don't matter if they're little bitty
[1:43:47] or if they're great big you just remind
[1:43:50] him that they're going to be dead at the
[1:43:52] end of the road hallelujah David he
[1:44:00] knowed what he believed he had that
[1:44:02] little old slingshot wrapped around his
[1:44:04] fingers like this in the way he went to
[1:44:06] me Goliath around and around and he said
[1:44:09] five stones he had five stones j esus
[1:44:13] what was what was in his fingers fa ith
[1:44:17] faith wrapped up in Jesus and here he
[1:44:20] went brother I'm telling him it's hit
[1:44:24] the rock to the killing place and downed
[1:44:26] a Goliath and dealt with Goliath you
[1:44:30] know what happened he used one stone to
[1:44:34] knock delgo life and all it takes is one
[1:44:36] word little broad one word and it'll
[1:44:39] destroy your enemy for the word of God
[1:44:41] is greater the Word of God is stronger
[1:44:44] the Word of God is more powerful than
[1:44:46] any sickness any demon any distress the
[1:44:49] Word of God one word will put the devil
[1:44:52] in his place
[1:44:53] what about when you start taking your
[1:44:55] position as a son of God and war is up
[1:44:58] and on hail and you release one word
[1:45:00] cancer has to stop sugar diabetes has to
[1:45:04] stop loneliness has to stop because one
[1:45:08] word he said you know what happened then
[1:45:15] the Israelites took courage and a way
[1:45:17] they went
[1:45:18] they cut Philistines plumb to the walls
[1:45:20] when the venom said it just takes one
[1:45:22] that's got enough courage to step out
[1:45:24] say it's right and God said so brother
[1:45:27] you down the Goliath and your whole
[1:45:29] family will go to cutting Philistines
[1:45:31] the first thing that you know oh the
[1:45:35] first thing that you know if you start
[1:45:37] taking courage I think it's amazing that
[1:45:40] we're watching
[1:45:42] a champion of champions in Brother on
[1:45:45] Spencer step out and we're right behind
[1:45:48] him we're watching him but can you
[1:45:51] realize what the enemy thinks he's doing
[1:45:55] to brother on but what he's doing to the
[1:45:57] rest of the congregation of Israel that
[1:46:00] it's given her courage to run out and
[1:46:03] the tear down the walls tear down
[1:46:06] destruction tear down homo tear these
[1:46:09] things down rather on you're all giving
[1:46:11] us courage to run this race to fight
[1:46:14] down bring down and battle out the
[1:46:17] demons in our life and we will not be
[1:46:19] defeated but we will overcome hallelujah
[1:46:26] what's in your hand what can you do some
[1:46:30] people say what can I do testify about
[1:46:32] sing a song about it if the devil don't
[1:46:35] like you talking about the are just keep
[1:46:37] talking about God if the dividend like
[1:46:39] you singing about God just keep singing
[1:46:41] about God do something for the glory of
[1:46:43] the Lord trust him through the battle
[1:46:47] trust him when you're standing right in
[1:46:49] front of the Goliath you remember the
[1:46:53] story I told you a while back about the
[1:46:55] man about the man telling a pastor the
[1:46:58] pastor said I know I know that God is
[1:47:01] with you and the pastor taught him said
[1:47:03] you know I can walk across that log
[1:47:05] right there and he walked across that
[1:47:07] log he said I know you can do that
[1:47:08] because the Lord is with you he said I
[1:47:10] can take a wheelbarrow cross there
[1:47:12] he said I know you came because the Lord
[1:47:14] is with you he said he said I can pack a
[1:47:16] log and I can go across her with a
[1:47:18] wheelbarrow he said I know you came
[1:47:20] because the Lord is with you and then
[1:47:22] the pastor tells him to get in the
[1:47:24] wheelbarrow
[1:47:24] he said now wait a minute you see it
[1:47:27] comes different when you're facing and
[1:47:30] trusting in your own life that you're
[1:47:32] putting your life in God's hands but I
[1:47:34] want you to know that you can get in the
[1:47:36] wheel barrel of this word and it'll
[1:47:38] protect you it'll take you through the
[1:47:40] fires it'll take you through the storms
[1:47:42] of life you can trust in this I wonder
[1:47:46] who's willing to get in the wheel barrel
[1:47:48] this morning this is a season of the
[1:47:51] Lord this is a seizing of the moving of
[1:47:54] the Lord
[1:47:55] we see the angel coming down and
[1:47:57] troubling the waters this is the hour I
[1:47:59] wouldn't wait I'd get in the water right
[1:48:01] now I'd say that the angel of healing is
[1:48:04] here get in the water I'd say that the
[1:48:07] healing angel is moving across our
[1:48:09] congregation across the bride of Jesus
[1:48:11] Christ giving her courage giving her
[1:48:14] confidence giving her instruction to
[1:48:17] stand in the water they come out whole
[1:48:22] you don't have to be the one waiting for
[1:48:24] Jesus to come by you can get in right
[1:48:26] now because by His stripes are already
[1:48:28] healed you don't have to wait down there
[1:48:31] by the water just get in it stand in
[1:48:34] that water this is the season of it you
[1:48:37] can take courage because this is the
[1:48:40] morning that we step in and we don't get
[1:48:43] out once you get in that water and I'm
[1:48:47] not just talking about some holy water
[1:48:49] that you can buy some from some fountain
[1:48:51] or from some boat some Pope or some
[1:48:53] bishop that you can brave you can break
[1:48:55] out on the bottle and they say it's holy
[1:48:56] water but I'm talking about getting in
[1:48:58] the word I'm talking about getting in
[1:49:00] the water of this word when you go to
[1:49:02] praising God for what he's already done
[1:49:04] and all of a sudden that healing angel
[1:49:07] that promised that he would come he
[1:49:09] stands guard over you and he wraps his
[1:49:11] wings around you and says you're
[1:49:14] sheltered in the wings of Almighty God
[1:49:17] for they that wait they that trust in
[1:49:23] the Lord he will renew their strength
[1:49:28] brother Branham said in perfecting the
[1:49:31] church called perfecting his church
[1:49:34] brother when you got a courage enough to
[1:49:36] step out and toe to toe to toe the line
[1:49:39] with the devil and scat him off he said
[1:49:42] if I went to my house tonight I got a
[1:49:45] legal deed for my house if I went in
[1:49:48] there and someone was laying down there
[1:49:50] drinking and carrying on and doing wrong
[1:49:52] I'd say you have to get out friend well
[1:49:55] this is a house for human beings I got a
[1:49:57] right to be in here I'd say you do not
[1:49:59] possess this house it's mine well he'd
[1:50:03] say I got a right just like a sickness
[1:50:04] enter the body or sin or whatever it is
[1:50:07] say well
[1:50:08] the other ones drink the other ones do
[1:50:11] this or the other ones be this way but
[1:50:13] he has no legal rights and I could take
[1:50:17] my abstract deed and go down to the
[1:50:20] courts and say looky here someone has
[1:50:23] moved in and that doesn't belong there
[1:50:26] this is mine it belongs to me and the
[1:50:29] law would come up and put them out
[1:50:32] because I have an abstract written deed
[1:50:34] to that property brother and sister we
[1:50:37] have an abstract written deed to life to
[1:50:40] salvation to divine healing and the
[1:50:42] devil has no rights trust God and the
[1:50:45] Holy Ghost to put him out you ain't got
[1:50:48] to put him out the Holy Ghost to put him
[1:50:50] out your baptism of the Holy Ghost will
[1:50:53] rise up on the inside of you and push
[1:50:55] the demon of cancer push the demon of
[1:50:58] fear right out of your life don't fear
[1:51:01] the promise is coming well I don't see
[1:51:06] it coming
[1:51:06] faith looks past what you see with these
[1:51:09] eyes it looks past the census faith sees
[1:51:14] what the body cannot some people say
[1:51:17] we're not going to have a rapture but I
[1:51:19] see it some people said we're not going
[1:51:22] to have a body change but I see it some
[1:51:25] people are saying we're not going to see
[1:51:26] miracles but I see it I see them coming
[1:51:30] I see him telling us that we're not
[1:51:32] going to leave this world I see him
[1:51:34] telling us that will not be changed but
[1:51:37] the Bible tells me that he's going to
[1:51:39] change me in a moment in a twinkling of
[1:51:41] an eye I can trust him through this
[1:51:44] battle and he will look upon us they
[1:51:46] stood for me I'll stand for them and
[1:51:49] pull them up and gravitation will lose
[1:51:52] its hold we're trusting in his promises
[1:51:56] you may not see it coming you may not
[1:52:01] see the miracle right before you but let
[1:52:04] me tell you the manifestation of the
[1:52:06] miracle is coming and it will be visible
[1:52:12] it's already invisible it's already
[1:52:15] there it's already moving it's already
[1:52:18] changing your life it's already changing
[1:52:20] your heart
[1:52:22] is not shook up this morning faith knows
[1:52:25] where it's standing out faith is resting
[1:52:28] in the promises of God you can have
[1:52:33] confidence in this word I'd say if Jesus
[1:52:36] had confidence in his word you and I can
[1:52:38] have confidence in his word if Jesus
[1:52:41] could go to the cross with confidence in
[1:52:44] his heart knowing what the Bible said in
[1:52:46] Psalm 16 and 10 that that there will not
[1:52:49] that God will not allow he would not
[1:52:52] destroy this body that he could not
[1:52:54] destroy this body and it'd not be raised
[1:52:57] back up again
[1:52:58] because the Bible had told him the Word
[1:53:01] of God had told him that I will not
[1:53:03] suffer my Holy One to see corruption and
[1:53:06] Jesus had confidence in what the word
[1:53:09] said he was so full of the quickening
[1:53:12] power that when they killed him he was
[1:53:15] so full of that quickening power that on
[1:53:17] the third day he had enough unction to
[1:53:20] be able to say to them destroy this
[1:53:22] temple and I'll raise it up again and
[1:53:25] there was so much power in the Word of
[1:53:28] God that even death could not hold Jesus
[1:53:31] back the stone could not hold Jesus back
[1:53:33] Rome could not hold Jesus back and I say
[1:53:36] that to you
[1:53:37] Church of the Living God Rome will not
[1:53:39] hold this body back we're gonna rise up
[1:53:43] out of the ground one of these morning's
[1:53:44] we're gonna rise her past her despair
[1:53:47] razza past our fears rise up past these
[1:53:50] things Rome won't stop us
[1:53:52] Satan won't stop us death won't stop us
[1:53:55] fear won't stop us
[1:53:57] the coronavirus won't stop us torment
[1:54:00] stop us cancer won't stop us fear won't
[1:54:04] stop us anxiety won't stop us depression
[1:54:07] won't stop us
[1:54:08] suicide won't stop us the enemy
[1:54:11] whispering in your ear you ain't gonna
[1:54:13] make it that's when the enemy when he
[1:54:15] comes in God raises a standard he may be
[1:54:18] flooding your mind with all kinds of
[1:54:20] things I'm gonna be shut in for two
[1:54:22] weeks that devil don't know what he's
[1:54:24] doing you're shut in and you're
[1:54:27] listening to a Prophet's were tell you
[1:54:29] to get ready come out of her sacrum a
[1:54:32] lock you up and pin you in a corner but
[1:54:35] I'll make a way of escape for it say to
[1:54:37] me Pina of cancer but God will make a
[1:54:39] way of escape for it Satan's tried to
[1:54:43] pin you in your home and he has no idea
[1:54:45] what he is doing you may be at your home
[1:54:48] enjoying these things of God but I want
[1:54:51] you to know Satan don't know what he's
[1:54:53] doing
[1:54:54] Satan ain't got a clue what he's doing
[1:54:57] because the bride of Jesus Christ her
[1:54:59] faith is lifting her faith is moving her
[1:55:04] faith is reacting and when we as the
[1:55:07] people of God get to assemble ourselves
[1:55:09] together again the Church of the Living
[1:55:11] God would take place in such a way that
[1:55:14] in a blow back the very eyebrows of
[1:55:16] Satan himself
[1:55:18] you have no idea Satan what you're doing
[1:55:21] we're studying like never before we're
[1:55:23] praying like never before we're eating
[1:55:26] this book were not eating just part of

[1:55:43] ready to leave Oh hallelujah

[1:55:49] book we've seen the Son of Man come down

[1:55:53] in this our standing this day but you're
[1:55:57] not standing alone God we're standing
[1:55:59] with you he come to me that morning two
[1:56:03] weeks ago and woke me up at 242 in the
[1:56:06] morning and said let's stand I'd say
[1:56:09] that if a mighty angel could stand and
[1:56:11] Michael can stand what about us as the
[1:56:14] bride of Jesus Christ in Revelations
[1:56:16] 10-8 stand up and take the book eat the
[1:56:19] book become the book alleluia we're
[1:56:23] standing and we're feeding on the

[1:56:33] confidence in the word and god's
[1:56:36] confident in what he's deposited in you
[1:56:38] he's confident that it will bring forth
[1:56:41] he's confident that it will produce you
[1:56:44] see God knew what he had placed in the
[1:56:46] woman at the well he was confident
[1:56:48] no sense and those he was living in a
[1:56:51] spot of sin yet God knew what she had on

[1:56:59] middle-aged hold people I want you to

[1:58:41] because you are another reproduction of
[1:58:44] the masterpiece Bible says in Isaiah 24
[1:58:51] or 15
[1:58:53] wherefore glorify you the Lord in the
[1:58:59] fires
[1:59:02] I'd say if you can trust him in a fire
[1:59:05] we have trusted him in a fire if we
[1:59:09] could praise him in a fire what are we
[1:59:14] going to do when we get outside the fire
[1:59:19] wherefore glorify you the Lord in the
[1:59:21] fires even the name of the Lord God of
[1:59:25] Israel in the Isles of the sea glorify
[1:59:30] you the Lord in the fires in your moment
[1:59:35] glorify Him and victory glorify Him when
[1:59:41] it seems her to feed it glorify him it's
[1:59:45] easy to trust when ain't nothing going
[1:59:48] on it's easy to trust when you've got
[1:59:51] two hundred people surrounding you but
[1:59:54] when you shut in by yourself can you
[1:59:56] trust me when it looks like the grips of
[2:00:02] death are trying to grab ahold of your
[2:00:04] life can you trust me it's easy to trust
[2:00:09] when nothing's going on twelve Spurgeon
[2:00:12] said this to trusting God to trust God
[2:00:15] and light in the light is nothing but to
[2:00:19] trust God and darkness is faith tis so
[2:00:25] sweet to trust in Jesus how I love him
[2:00:30] more and more it's so sweet to trust in
[2:00:35] Jesus that will wipe away your tears
[2:00:43] there's been moments in this battle I
[2:00:47] have not questioned why but I have
[2:00:52] questioned who who did this who caused
[2:00:58] this
[2:01:00] and we know that this battle came from
[2:01:03] Satan so we can send it back to Satan so
[2:01:09] we know who is trying to defeat us and
[2:01:12] we know who is trying to bring us
[2:01:15] victory there's been moments in this
[2:01:18] battle when I thought that the wave
[2:01:23] would overtake me and overwhelm me but
[2:01:31] as our pastor said I've been sick before
[2:01:33] but I made it I've been through storms
[2:01:42] before but I made it
[2:01:44] I cried before but I made it whoo I've
[2:01:52] been tried to been stopped before by
[2:01:54] Satan but I made it and I've trusted him
[2:02:00] before and I made it if I trusted him
[2:02:04] through the rest of my life what should
[2:02:07] I do now I'll just keep on trusting him
[2:02:12] but there's been moments that's a human
[2:02:15] being when you look and you think what
[2:02:19] more what next is coming but God says
[2:02:23] I'm preparing you I'm preparing you for
[2:02:27] a tremendous victory there's been
[2:02:33] moments in your own life when you've
[2:02:34] cried and you've asked God how much
[2:02:37] longer will I have to put up with this
[2:02:39] and God says trust me trust me I'll use
[2:02:45] you like never before he's going to use
[2:02:49] you're trying to bring about a victory
[2:02:56] when you look at the profit of the Lord
[2:02:58] in this hour when he lost his wife hope
[2:03:03] and now his little Sharon Rose is coming
[2:03:06] down to the spot
[2:03:09] which life is being depleted from her
[2:03:14] life is being taken from her her eyes
[2:03:18] are crossed and the black seat has come
[2:03:21] down between he and God but the Branham
[2:03:25] said then Satan moved in and says will
[2:03:30] you trust him now
[2:03:32] it's easy to trust God when everything
[2:03:34] is easy but when you're trusting God in
[2:03:37] the midst of these moments it's Satan
[2:03:42] himself moved in and said will you trust
[2:03:46] him now he's taking your wife he's
[2:03:50] taking your little girl but Satan didn't
[2:03:55] know what he was doing if you hear him
[2:04:00] say the Lord God gives and the Lord God
[2:04:03] takes away though he slay me yet I will
[2:04:07] trust him you could take my life but
[2:04:11] I'll still trust you can come with
[2:04:13] storms but I'll still trust you
[2:04:15] Satan you may come and try to move in
[2:04:18] and say will you trust him now and we
[2:04:21] scream back we'll trust him
[2:04:23] we'll trust him he'll lead us all the
[2:04:26] way he'll bring us all the way through
[2:04:29] you see the credit is due to the man
[2:04:34] that is in the arena when the man in the
[2:04:37] arena that is standing there all alone
[2:04:39] and he's still willing to stand there
[2:04:42] all alone when Satan's coming in with
[2:04:44] every gun and every tactic and every
[2:04:46] power and he's trying to stop the move
[2:04:49] of God and there's a challenge that is
[2:04:52] set before with you but will you answer
[2:04:55] the Challenger will you answer him will
[2:04:59] you answer him and stand alone in the
[2:05:01] ring with Satan and all of his forces
[2:05:05] you can hear the bell ring as a boxer
[2:05:09] steps under the ropes and the bell rings
[2:05:12] and the Challenger is standing out there
[2:05:14] before you the opposition is standing
[2:05:16] out there before you you can have a
[2:05:18] coach in your side you can have your
[2:05:21] coach in your
[2:05:22] over in your corner I preach to you this
[2:05:25] word I've told you this word you can
[2:05:27] have friends in your corner you can have
[2:05:29] that you can have sched spectators in
[2:05:32] your corner
[2:05:32] but remember at the end of the day
[2:05:34] that's all they are as spectators you're
[2:05:36] the one in the room you're the one in
[2:05:39] the ring in there you can have every
[2:05:41] confidence behind you telling you can
[2:05:43] make it but you're the one standing
[2:05:45] there I can tell you that if you accept
[2:05:49] the Word of God you'll make it through I
[2:05:51] can tell you by his stripes are healed
[2:05:53] and I can tell you that you'll make it
[2:05:55] through but when you take a hit maybe I
[2:06:00] don't feel the effect of the punch and
[2:06:04] you take it with full force and you can
[2:06:07] look back and say you don't know what
[2:06:08] you're talking about
[2:06:09] you've never been through this before
[2:06:12] you might be correct but there is
[2:06:16] somebody bigger than me in your corner
[2:06:19] he knows every blow he knows what you're
[2:06:22] going through
[2:06:22] the son of man may have not been battled
[2:06:25] by cancer in the flesh when he was here
[2:06:27] 2,000 years ago but do not ever think
[2:06:31] that he did not conquer cancer for when
[2:06:34] he was at the cross he felt the spirit
[2:06:37] of cancer he felt the spirit of
[2:06:39] depression he felt the spirit of
[2:06:41] loneliness he thought the spirit of
[2:06:43] every demon of hell
[2:06:45] and he wrapped his arms around all of
[2:06:47] those demons and said I take you and I
[2:06:50] destroy you for my body's sake he may
[2:06:54] have not conquered cancer he men not had
[2:06:57] cancer in his own body but don't you
[2:07:00] ever think that he didn't conquer it he
[2:07:02] conquered death hell and the grave you
[2:07:06] can line up all your demons right there
[2:07:08] and you'll never stop Jesus you can line
[2:07:11] up all your fears and you'll never stop
[2:07:13] Jesus come on somebody he Jesus may have
[2:07:18] never thought he man never had to go to
[2:07:21] the doctor for a prognosis of cancer but
[2:07:24] now in the body of the son of man he is
[2:07:28] conquering cancer for the body of Ron
[2:07:30] Spitzer he is conquering fear
[2:07:33] in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:07:36] the body of Tim Pruett in the body of
[2:07:39] Donnie Reagan in the body in the body of
[2:07:43] his bride Jesus Christ is conquering
[2:07:46] everything that comes against you and
[2:07:49] you will not be to feed it he overcame
[2:07:53] every channel he overcame every obstacle
[2:07:57] and the son of man is conquering and I'd
[2:08:02] say that he's looking upon his children
[2:08:05] he says that's a body that I can trust
[2:08:09] that's a body that I can move in and
[2:08:12] that's what we're watching we're
[2:08:14] watching the moving of the body because
[2:08:17] you see the body is moving in accordance
[2:08:20] to the headship that has come down in
[2:08:22] this hour in the intellect that has come
[2:08:24] down that's not been another age and
[2:08:27] when the intellects came down but in
[2:08:29] this age the headship of Christ has come
[2:08:32] down and the headship is now working
[2:08:34] through a body a body he can move here a
[2:08:37] body he can breathe him a body he can
[2:08:39] live here a body he can overcome here
[2:08:42] and there on this in the inside of this
[2:08:44] body
[2:08:45] it's a rapture in faith that will lift
[2:08:47] you above it lifts you above it inside
[2:08:51] of this body is Jesus Christ if Jesus
[2:08:54] Christ conquered then he'll conquer now
[2:08:59] hello hello yeah bride of Jesus Christ
[2:09:07] the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth
[2:09:12] the angels don't know what it is to sing
[2:09:18] amazing grace but you're singing it
[2:09:22] victoriously the Angels don't understand
[2:09:25] the grace of God but you're singing it
[2:09:27] victoriously they don't understand you
[2:09:30] can sing you can imagine as God has the
[2:09:33] greatest angel choir surrounding him
[2:09:36] singing holy holy holy is the Lord God
[2:09:39] Almighty well when you start singing
[2:09:45] you start singing the songs of victory
[2:09:49] the Angels have to step back because
[2:09:52] they don't understand they don't
[2:09:55] understand what you're going through
[2:09:59] they don't understand they don't
[2:10:02] understand what you're facing
[2:10:04] they don't understand because they can't
[2:10:05] sing from that spot but you can oh you
[2:10:10] can you may have battles but trust him
[2:10:14] to that battle and sing like never
[2:10:16] before you see when you go to singing
[2:10:19] the praises of God go up to God and God
[2:10:23] comes down and habits the praises of his
[2:10:25] people
[2:10:26] he's surrounding you with his presence
[2:10:29] he's surrounding you with his love and
[2:10:32] you are sheltered in his wings and they
[2:10:37] have to watch you or so they have to
[2:10:41] watch you when you start singing because
[2:10:59] he first loved me when you start singing
[2:11:04] from a body that has been redeemed the
[2:11:08] church world can sing songs and they
[2:11:10] become anointed to write songs but when
[2:11:13] the bride of Jesus Christ starts singing
[2:11:15] that so during her song she starts
[2:11:19] singing those songs of grace and mercy
[2:11:21] and peace and all of a sudden he becomes
[2:11:28] ever so evident that he's there beside
[2:11:30] you
[2:11:31] they Sara with you he starts inhabited
[2:11:36] your phrase out of you comes a worship
[2:11:42] out of you comes a praise then nobody
[2:11:46] else can understand but you're singing
[2:11:49] it from a spot
[2:11:52] that through all the trial you trusted
[2:11:55] him I love it to get out on the other
[2:12:00] side of a battle and I'll be honest with
[2:12:04] you I'm ready for the battle against the
[2:12:06] bride of Jesus Christ the ministry of
[2:12:10] Christ
[2:12:11] I'm ready to see victory I'd say that
[2:12:16] all of us as a church we're ready to see
[2:12:20] a complete victory and we will see that
[2:12:24] but I love that when you get on the
[2:12:26] other side of a trial the blessing on
[2:12:30] the other side of that thing
[2:12:32] you can shout like never before you can
[2:12:35] praise like never before and you can
[2:12:37] sing like never before and Satan hates
[2:12:41] it that's why he's trying to stop you
[2:12:43] he's trying to keep you from believing
[2:12:46] in a God that can he's trying to keep
[2:12:49] you from a believing in a God that will
[2:12:52] we know like Shadrach and meshach and
[2:12:55] abednego said when they were getting
[2:12:57] ready to go into the flames of the fire
[2:12:59] when they headed it up seven times
[2:13:01] harder than it was before that when they
[2:13:04] walked him getting ready to walk into it
[2:13:06] we don't know whether our God will but
[2:13:09] we know that he's able but we as a body
[2:13:12] believe more than he's able we believe
[2:13:15] that he will he's acting and moving in a
[2:13:18] body that believes that he will do it he
[2:13:22] said he do it I take him at his word
[2:13:24] they heated it up seven times harder and
[2:13:27] when they come out letting the King look
[2:13:30] down there said I thought we threw three
[2:13:32] in there but I see one like the son of
[2:13:34] man were walking in the flames of the
[2:13:37] fire and when they come out of the fire
[2:13:39] there was not even a smell on them of
[2:13:43] the flames he could not touch them he
[2:13:46] could not get in their garments sin has
[2:13:48] become very sticky and it's become the
[2:13:51] cry to try to stop you but it is not
[2:13:54] even a sin of sin on your life when the
[2:13:58] blood of Jesus Christ annihilates that
[2:14:00] sin he glows back up on the dead
[2:14:03] and the devil hates you for repenting
[2:14:05] because the brother branham said that
[2:14:07] when you repent it brings you out of the
[2:14:10] trap of the enemy so repent and get out
[2:14:15] of the trap God doesn't have no use for
[2:14:19] a coward if you're afraid to trust him
[2:14:22] don't even make an effort until you're
[2:14:24] satisfied that he keeps his word and he
[2:14:27] keeps his promise then there's nothing
[2:14:30] gonna stop you
[2:14:33] Psalms not a woman and for he shall
[2:14:36] cover thee with his feathers and under
[2:14:40] his wings shalt thou trust his truth
[2:14:43] shall be thy shield and buckler his
[2:14:47] truth is something you could trust you
[2:14:50] you can imagine as that mother Eagle has
[2:14:53] the Prophet would tell us how that that
[2:14:55] mother eagle would take her eagerly
[2:14:57] talent for their flight for their first
[2:15:00] flight and she tells him don't be scared
[2:15:03] hang on to me don't be scared you can
[2:15:06] trust me don't be scared you can imagine
[2:15:10] as Abraham has waited for the promise
[2:15:13] for 25 years he trusted in the promise
[2:15:16] for 25 years he receives the promise and
[2:15:19] God was only receiving in of it he was
[2:15:23] only receiving another and he watched he
[2:15:26] watched his son Isaac grow up and now
[2:15:29] the same voice that had led him out let
[2:15:32] him out of his homeland let him to this
[2:15:34] land let him through every trial and he
[2:15:36] trusted him through that he trusted in
[2:15:39] him through the waiting of the baby he
[2:15:41] trusted him when he got the baby and now
[2:15:44] he takes the greatest walk of his life
[2:15:47] when the voice says take mine only son
[2:15:50] in Genesis 22 and sacrifice your only
[2:15:54] Son you're coming down to a spot I
[2:15:58] trusted
[2:16:01] but Abraham knew that if God was able to
[2:16:07] give me a child in in the deadness of my
[2:16:11] life in the deadness of Sarah's womb
[2:16:14] he's more than able to resurrect him up
[2:16:16] he didn't know how it was happening but
[2:16:19] he trusted him
[2:16:21] can you imagine as this is spoken to
[2:16:24] Abraham if you'll trust me through this
[2:16:27] I'll use you like never before that seed
[2:16:30] had to live through him came the Royal
[2:16:34] seed of Abraham and he trusted him like
[2:16:37] never before and all of a sudden he
[2:16:42] watched God watched his son taking his
[2:16:46] only begotten Son i pong cow golf is
[2:16:50] here and he wants his trust in his word
[2:16:54] and he watched what he said and he came
[2:16:57] and stayed the hand of Abraham he said
[2:17:04] and he called that place Jehovah Jireh
[2:17:06] for my Lord hath provided my sacrifice
[2:17:10] as the eagle mother Eagle tells her
[2:17:14] children trust me trust me and you'll
[2:17:18] use all wings like never before
[2:17:20] proud of Jesus Christ trust him and
[2:17:23] you'll use the old testament and the new
[2:17:25] testament wings like never before
[2:17:28] you've used it in the past to defeat
[2:17:30] satan with but watch what's getting
[2:17:32] ready to take place I'm going to use you
[2:17:34] like never before
[2:17:36] though God of all peace is destroying
[2:17:39] Satan under your feet
[2:17:42] whose feet is he going to use your feet
[2:17:45] if Abraham could trust him and did not
[2:17:48] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost what
[2:17:51] about you has the body of Jesus Christ
[2:17:53] you ought to be able to say like Paul
[2:17:55] said in Romans 8 and 38 for I am
[2:17:58] persuaded that neither death nor life
[2:18:01] nor Angels nor principalities nor powers
[2:18:03] nor things present nor things to come
[2:18:05] nor height nor death nor any other
[2:18:07] creature shall be able to separate us
[2:18:10] from the love of God which is in Christ
[2:18:12] Jesus our Lord
[2:18:14] I'm persuaded that he's able to keep me
[2:18:17] I'm persuaded that nothing's gonna rob
[2:18:19] me I'm persuaded that nothing's gonna
[2:18:21] steal from me I'm persuaded that God is
[2:18:24] for me and if God is for me who can be
[2:18:26] against me I'm persuaded that I can do
[2:18:30] all things through Christ who
[2:18:32] strengthens me I'm persuaded that no
[2:18:34] weapon that is formed against the bride
[2:18:36] of Jesus Christ shall prosper I am
[2:18:38] persuaded that when the enemy comes in
[2:18:40] like a flood that's when God raises a
[2:18:42] standard this is the time when the
[2:18:45] standard of the word of Jesus Christ is
[2:18:47] being raised like never before the
[2:18:52] Prophet said what we need today is a God
[2:18:54] resurrected from the dead and on hand
[2:18:56] right now to do whatever he promised he
[2:18:59] would do to confirm his word and we need
[2:19:02] delegates out there in the audience
[2:19:04] who's willing to rest their soul on any
[2:19:06] word that God said and put it to action
[2:19:09] that's what we need today that's what we
[2:19:12] need is men and women who stand up to
[2:19:14] the forefront there and call the devil a
[2:19:17] liar and say Jesus Christ stripped you
[2:19:20] and robbed you of every right you had
[2:19:22] and I'm in Christ Jesus and the world
[2:19:24] belongs to me a man blind Bartimaeus
[2:19:29] could trust him I can't - if the woman
[2:19:33] with the blood is who could trust him I
[2:19:34] can't - if the leopard could trust him I
[2:19:37] can't - if the servants at the wedding
[2:19:41] of Canaan could trust him to pour water
[2:19:44] into those vessels I can trust him that
[2:19:47] he'll pour the revelation into these
[2:19:51] into these vessels and he'll stimulate
[2:19:54] us like never before if they could trust
[2:19:58] him I could trust him if the disciples
[2:20:00] could trust him and Peter could trust
[2:20:03] him and said lord if it be you bid me
[2:20:06] come and he said it is I be not afraid
[2:20:08] I'd say us as the children of God we
[2:20:12] could trust in him we could believe in
[2:20:15] him and we could step out on the waters
[2:20:17] unafraid you can trust in him who can
[2:20:21] believe in him
[2:20:22] and you will bring a battle victory for
[2:20:25] none other than that Jesus Christ
[2:20:27] our Lord and Savior the Prophet said
[2:20:30] you're his victory the Prophet said that
[2:20:33] we don't trust in anything else but thus
[2:20:35] saith the Lord
[2:20:37] he said notice the harmony between the
[2:20:41] bridegroom and the bride
[2:20:42] she has thus saith the Lord of sets
[2:20:45] field that's what we're trusting in is
[2:20:48] thus saith the Lord this messages came
[2:20:52] the messengers came the message followed
[2:20:55] and the people of the message have taken
[2:20:58] it and Satan can't stop us if dad no
[2:21:03] trusted him in our lion's den back into
[2:21:06] if David trusted him in the Valley of
[2:21:10] Elah I can - if Abraham trusted him to
[2:21:14] bring back take out of his 318 servants
[2:21:17] and bring back everything that the enemy
[2:21:20] had stole I can - if David could trust
[2:21:24] Almighty God when he encouraged himself
[2:21:26] in the Lord to go out there and take
[2:21:29] back everything that the devil stole
[2:21:30] from him I can - if the he three Hebrew
[2:21:34] children could trust in him in the midst
[2:21:36] of the flames
[2:21:37] I came true he can't change he's the
[2:21:42] same God he's the same word he's the
[2:21:45] same yesterday today and forever they
[2:21:48] trusted in a supernatural God and I can
[2:21:50] trust in him what was the theme of this
[2:21:55] message Jesus Christ is same yesterday
[2:21:58] today and forever turn with me in your
[2:22:04] Bibles to Psalms chapter 56 and verse 1
[2:22:12] as we bring begin to bring these things
[2:22:15] to a close Psalms 56 in verse 1 be
[2:22:23] merciful unto me O God for man would
[2:22:28] swallow me up he fighteth daily oppress
[2:22:33] with me
[2:22:35] enemies would daily swallow me up for
[2:22:38] they be many that fight against me
[2:22:41] although almost ah what time I am afraid
[2:22:46] I will trust in thee in God I will
[2:22:48] praise His Word in God have I put my
[2:22:51] trust I will not fear what flesh can do
[2:22:54] under me every day the rest my words all
[2:22:59] their thoughts are against me for evil
[2:23:02] they gather themselves together they
[2:23:05] hide themselves they mark my steps watch
[2:23:08] this when they wait for my soul shall
[2:23:13] they escape my iniquity and not anger
[2:23:15] cast down the people of God
[2:23:17] now tell us my wonderings put now my
[2:23:24] tears into the bottle are not they in
[2:23:28] that book they're in my book when I
[2:23:33] crime dove he then shall my enemies turn

[2:23:41] watch your enemies turn back if there
[2:23:44] ever was a time to pray if there ever
[2:23:46] was a time to cry out to God speak to
[2:23:49] God right now's the time for when you

[2:24:21] thou not will not thou deliver my feet
[2:24:24] from falling that I may walk before the
[2:24:26] God in the light of the living who I
[2:24:31] have put my trust in God and I will not
[2:24:34] be afraid what man can do unto me but I
[2:24:37] love what David said that the enemy has
[2:24:40] marked my steps
[2:24:42] Satan is marching and he's marking your
[2:24:46] face
[2:24:47] he is marking where you walk down the
[2:24:50] Lord told us that every footstep was a
[2:24:53] possession how Hale hates to hear these
[2:24:56] testimonies that if brother wrong was
[2:24:59] brought through when he fell off of a
[2:25:02] 40-foot ladder and he trusted to them
[2:25:04] what is he gonna do when he trusts him
[2:25:07] now how Satan is marking our steps Lord
[2:25:12] o bride now that we're watching the
[2:25:14] testimonies of Esther watching the
[2:25:17] testimonies of Anna Thomas
[2:25:18] watching the testimony of Tim Pruett
[2:25:21] watching the testimonies of Donnie
[2:25:23] Reagan watching the testimonies of a
[2:25:25] living God living in his people how
[2:25:28] Satan hates that when he thought he had
[2:25:31] you in his scripts and all of a sudden
[2:25:33] he lose him because the Son of Man is
[2:25:35] still conquering in a body he is marking
[2:25:38] your steps
[2:25:38] he's afraid when you take afoot staff
[2:25:41] but I want you to know that the Bible
[2:25:44] tells us that he hath enlarged our steps
[2:25:47] that we might not slip if Satan is
[2:25:50] marking our steps and God said he's
[2:25:52] enlarged in our footsteps what about
[2:25:55] that Satan is marking every footstep
[2:25:59] that you take I'd say I start taking
[2:26:03] those steps into the Word of God like
[2:26:05] never before the bride has had victories
[2:26:08] he's marked those victories but he never
[2:26:12] seen what's getting ready to transpire
[2:26:14] because God has spoke to us directly and
[2:26:18] said that if you'll trust me you can
[2:26:22] answer me you can answer me by the way
[2:26:26] screaming out by the way of the internet
[2:26:28] and by the way of prayer and by the way
[2:26:30] of you speaking you cannot just say this
[2:26:33] to me but you can say this to God I'd
[2:26:35] say that God is asking every one of you
[2:26:37] this morning if you trust me do you
[2:26:40] trust him do you trust him he says if
[2:26:44] you trust me I'll use you like never
[2:26:47] before we trusted him to a snake bite
[2:26:50] and he used him like never before we
[2:26:54] trusted him through lightning through
[2:26:56] strokes through heart attacks and he
[2:26:58] used him like never before
[2:27:00] we trusted him through the fire we
[2:27:08] trusted him to a fire and he come out
[2:27:11] and he used him like never before I'd
[2:27:15] say that in the last 12 years maybe I
[2:27:18] could be wrong because I don't have the
[2:27:20] stat sheets of hell but I'd say in the
[2:27:22] last 12 years
[2:27:24] brother Anse ministry has put double the
[2:27:28] black eyes on the enemy there what he
[2:27:31] did before that I don't have the stats
[2:27:36] eats inhale but he'll knows he'll knows
[2:27:39] what happened he'll knows how many times
[2:27:42] they were defeated he'll knows when they
[2:27:44] had to tuck their tail and run back to
[2:27:46] hell and say they were defeated what I
[2:27:48] want you to get ready get your record
[2:27:50] books ready hell because Ron Spencer's
[2:27:53] ministry is being trusted by Almighty
[2:27:56] God and he's going to be used like never
[2:27:59] before
[2:28:00] Sohail get ready to get black eyes ready
[2:28:04] to get blue eyes ready to get bruised
[2:28:06] like never before
[2:28:07] for we as the army of God are behind him
[2:28:10] with everything that is within us and we
[2:28:13] trust him we trust him like a never
[2:28:16] before
[2:28:19] Alleluia little bride keep pressing on
[2:28:25] no matter what you come against in the
[2:28:28] upcoming weeks your shelter your
[2:28:33] sheltered and shut it in your homes but
[2:28:35] your sheltered in the arms of God be
[2:28:39] used like never before
[2:28:40] trust him like never before for the
[2:28:43] answers of God or nearer they're closer
[2:28:46] they're watching trust him trust him
[2:28:54] watch for him the moving of the angels
[2:28:58] here
[2:29:01] he's come to minister to you he's come
[2:29:05] to touch your life he's come to console
[2:29:08] your heart I tell you do not be afraid
[2:29:12] do not be afraid no plague will come now
[2:29:16] that dwelling there's a greater plague
[2:29:22] out there than the corona of ours and
[2:29:24] it's sin disease but it shall not come
[2:29:27] nigh thy dwelling with you that have
[2:29:31] loved ones out there that you're still
[2:29:33] claiming apply the token and send the
[2:29:38] Holy Ghost after them like never before
[2:29:40] this is not a time to be fearful and
[2:29:43] this is not a time to be afraid and this
[2:29:46] is not a time I'm sure that there are
[2:29:48] there are communities that are using
[2:29:50] these tactics to try to scare people
[2:29:52] into the kingdom of God but fear never
[2:29:55] drives you to God faith drives you to
[2:29:58] God don't allow the enemy to try to
[2:30:02] drive you into loving Jesus you love
[2:30:05] Jesus with all your heart you become
[2:30:09] closer to him like never before
[2:30:11] and when we come out on the other side
[2:30:13] of the sayings and we are join ourselves
[2:30:16] together may all the Angels watch us as
[2:30:20] we gather as we begin to worship as
[2:30:24] faith begins to rise and the rapture
[2:30:27] that is in the body now such take a hold
[2:30:30] of our lives don't you be afraid don't
[2:30:34] you fear you take the precautions like
[2:30:37] the government told you to take
[2:30:38] precautions but you trust Jesus you wash
[2:30:41] your hands like the doctors have told
[2:30:43] you but you trust Jesus I trust God but
[2:30:48] I still wear my seat belt I trust God by
[2:30:51] still washed my hands I trust God but I
[2:30:54] still go to the doctor I trust God in
[2:30:56] everything so just because we take these
[2:31:00] precautions as the body of Jesus Christ
[2:31:02] does not show that we do not distrust
[2:31:05] him it shows that we have common sense
[2:31:09] and we are trusting in a Living God
[2:31:14] there's a blood there's a blood that
[2:31:18] will protect you there's a blood that is
[2:31:20] for you if you trusted him before and
[2:31:32] you trust him through this I cannot even
[2:31:36] as I said this Herrmann makes me anxious
[2:31:39] to see what God is going to do what are
[2:31:45] the things that we face to God what are
[2:31:48] the things that we go through what are
[2:31:50] these things to God the Prophet said the
[2:31:53] least little touch of God is omnipotent
[2:31:55] it's all powerful it only takes one
[2:31:58] little touch and these things are
[2:32:01] dissolved God that spin the world off of
[2:32:06] his fingertips what are these things -
[2:32:09] God the promise of a son was coming
[2:32:18] there had been a dance I never had been
[2:32:23] a great gathering for the son of the
[2:32:29] armour and company but he did not choose
[2:32:34] the rest of the sisters he chose that
[2:32:39] little lady that walked out and was
[2:32:41] carrying the wash water that walked out
[2:32:45] there barefooted before him I see
[2:32:49] humbled herself and he's seen a
[2:32:52] character on the inside of her on the
[2:32:58] inside of her that he could trust they
[2:33:03] other sisters he did not see that
[2:33:06] character in but he's seen in this lady
[2:33:09] of grace we slipped the wedding band of
[2:33:14] unmerited grace upon you before the
[2:33:16] foundation of the world he had
[2:33:19] confidence in your character
[2:33:24] throughout the whole year she was
[2:33:27] preparing for his coming life went on
[2:33:31] critics passed by sisters passed by
[2:33:36] skepticism passed by but she was
[2:33:39] trusting she was believing because he
[2:33:44] made a promise to her that where I am
[2:33:48] you will be also and on this day from a
[2:33:53] year from now I'm coming for you and she
[2:33:57] made herself ready she saved up all of
[2:34:01] her energies and she studied on that
[2:34:04] stored up food and she made herself
[2:34:06] ready and the Prophet said that she has
[2:34:10] the material on earth now to make
[2:34:12] herself ready
[2:34:13] and this little bride has made herself
[2:34:15] ready and on that day she steps out from
[2:34:20] that door she takes off the apron for
[2:34:24] the last time she stops washing dishes
[2:34:26] for the last time she stops cleaning for
[2:34:29] the last time and she walks out goes
[2:34:32] into a room gets the clothes and there's
[2:34:36] her wedding dress and she puts the
[2:34:39] wedding dress home that is spotless who
[2:34:42] that makes her pure that shows that
[2:34:45] there's no blemish on her and she walks
[2:34:47] out and the rest of the world is making
[2:34:50] front of this little bride and she steps
[2:34:53] out on the patio and she walks down the
[2:34:56] walkway and she goes by the gate and all
[2:34:59] of a sudden the Sun comes and he picks
[2:35:03] her up he's got trust in you little bra
[2:35:07] he's got trust in you may the musicians
[2:35:11] come
[2:35:13] psalms 125 and verse 1 they that trust
[2:35:18] in the lord shall be as a mount design
[2:35:22] which cannot be removed but about it
[2:35:24] forever as the mountains are round about
[2:35:27] Jerusalem so the Lord is round about us
[2:35:30] people from hits forth even forever we
[2:35:35] will trust in him
[2:35:37] forever for in him his everlasting
