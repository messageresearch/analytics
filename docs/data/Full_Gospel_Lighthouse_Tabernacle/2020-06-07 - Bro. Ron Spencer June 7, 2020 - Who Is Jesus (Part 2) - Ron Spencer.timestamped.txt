[53:30] good time to go marry a man or a woman I
[53:32] don't want you to know that amen so amen
[53:37] so just my hair so we certainly we
[53:40] certainly love you we congratulate our
[53:43] our graduates and and maybe later we can
[53:47] do that all properly and and you know we
[53:52] just live in a very different time and
[53:55] we'll get it through an end but it's
[53:59] been awesome for me because it's given
[54:01] me great privacy at home to go through
[54:04] this sickness and and amen if you're
[54:08] sick definitely don't come in my house
[54:10] so amen and thank you for letting me
[54:13] come in a little bit late and leave a
[54:15] little bit early over this last couple
[54:17] services and and that's kind of what we
[54:20] will do for a bit I was I'm still on
[54:24] restrictions and Mary Mary I'll find you
[54:27] there you are
[54:28] don't you dare tell Amen I got a seer in
[54:33] the morning we don't wander no and I'm
[54:35] preaching yet so a my god bless you
[54:39] Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 amen
[54:46] I want to speak to you this morning on
[54:49] who is Jesus part 2 and I I spoke a few
[54:56] weeks ago on who is Jesus and just to
[55:01] give you a little idea I'm not going to
[55:04] hold you very long and so if you can
[55:08] just bear with me until I begin to get
[55:11] my strength back I sure would appreciate
[55:13] that we certainly love you with all of
[55:16] our hearts
[55:17] I had a friend go to be with the Lord
[55:19] this week in ivory coast Africa and he's
[55:24] a pillar there brother Eric
[55:26] and we want to remember the churches
[55:29] that he was involved with there I
[55:31] preached in many meetings with him and
[55:34] he was a pillar and so we we just want
[55:38] to remember that that the audience's
[55:41] that are affected by his death and he
[55:44] was a he was a younger man I'm pretty
[55:46] sure that I am and they just had a real
[55:49] short illness and went to be with the
[55:51] Lord amen
[55:53] I want to go to be with the Lord any
[55:55] time he wants to call your amens may not
[56:00] be very good right there but it's kind
[56:02] of like a man and woman walking through
[56:04] heaven and they're walking and they're
[56:08] looking at all the sights that they're
[56:11] seeing and as they're walking through
[56:14] you know and they're looking at this and
[56:17] pointing at that and pointing at that
[56:21] and he looks over at his wife and he
[56:23] said you know she said isn't this great
[56:27] and he said you know we'd have been here
[56:30] five years ago if you hadn't had me on
[56:33] that good diet amen we know better than
[56:40] that but the footsteps as the righteous
[56:42] are ordered of the Lord amen god bless
[56:45] you Luke chapter 10 and verse 17 and the
[56:52] seventy returned again with again with
[56:55] joy saying Lord even the Devils are
[57:00] subject unto us through thy name and he
[57:04] said unto him I beheld as Satan as
[57:08] lightning falling from heaven and these
[57:13] are Jesus's words behold I given to you
[57:19] power to tread upon serpents and
[57:23] scorpions and over the power of the
[57:27] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[57:30] hurt you notwithstanding in this rejoice
[57:37] not that the spirits are subject unto
[57:41] you but rather rejoice because your
[57:45] names are written in heaven and I want
[57:52] you to catch that just a moment we live
[57:55] in two worlds and we see with our senses
[58:01] but God wants to you to see beyond what
[58:06] you see he wants you to see beyond what
[58:12] you see into an eternal realm and then
[58:18] that our Jesus rejoiced in the spirit
[58:21] and said I I thank the old Father Lord
[58:24] of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid
[58:27] these things from the wise and the
[58:30] prudent and hath revealed them unto
[58:32] babes even so father it seemed good in
[58:38] and good in the sight all things are
[58:43] delivered to them of my father and no
[58:47] man knoweth who the son is but the
[58:49] father and who the father is but the Son
[58:52] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[58:56] and he turned unto the hid under his
[58:59] disciples and this is an incredible
[59:02] statement he turned unto his disciples
[59:05] and said privately this is a statement
[59:12] blessed are your eyes which see the
[59:18] things which you see I can't put enough
[59:22] emphasis on those words at this present
[59:27] moment I can't put enough emphasis on
[59:29] those those words blessed are your eyes
[59:34] for they see for I tell you the truth
[59:40] that many prophets and
[59:45] things have desired to see the things
[59:50] which you see and have not seen them and
[59:55] to hear the things which you hear and
[1:00:01] have not hurt them amen let's speak to
[1:00:05] the Lord now
[1:00:06] Almighty God how we love you with all of
[1:00:10] our hearts now we thank you to be in
[1:00:13] your house this morning I pray that
[1:00:16] you'd bless this audience bless this
[1:00:18] group of people those that are at home
[1:00:21] and maybe that we can only in a few more
[1:00:23] days be able to all come together
[1:00:26] I pray chip bless our church strengthen
[1:00:29] us watch over us touch our bodies even
[1:00:34] now as I stand here to speak I pray that
[1:00:37] you touch me in a supernatural way
[1:00:40] father I need your touch and I need to
[1:00:43] touch and I ask you that you help me now
[1:00:46] in Jesus name Amen and amen amen you can
[1:00:51] be seated
[1:00:56] many would look at this man as a frail
[1:00:59] man I'm not going to even attempt it
[1:01:02] they would look at him as a frail man
[1:01:06] standing there that day and maybe in his
[1:01:10] little body probably wouldn't have been
[1:01:12] waved a hundred and fifty pounds slender
[1:01:17] body aging way too quickly but even many
[1:01:24] would ask who was this Jesus maybe you
[1:01:29] even even ponder why's that I would
[1:01:31] begin a series on who is Jesus at this
[1:01:36] time in our lives
[1:01:37] I'm afraid that too many that even said
[1:01:41] in church had missed who Jesus really is
[1:01:46] are you with me more than just God sent
[1:01:49] a message to this earth and they missed
[1:01:51] the message but Jesus stands in
[1:01:55] operating rooms he stands in the halls
[1:01:58] of governments and they turn him down he
[1:02:02] stood in many churches and they now have
[1:02:05] Ichabod written across the door even in
[1:02:10] message churches many times we miss what
[1:02:13] God is doing right among us sitting in
[1:02:18] pews a lot of times people sit and think
[1:02:22] about you know if my favorite speaker
[1:02:25] was speaking or maybe the conditions
[1:02:29] were a little bit different and they
[1:02:31] miss Jesus
[1:02:33] case in point brother Branham would call
[1:02:36] people out by name called them out by
[1:02:42] name
[1:02:43] tell them the condition one particular
[1:02:46] individual that I'm thinking about now
[1:02:48] call them out by name tell them seven
[1:02:51] different things about himself come away
[1:02:56] from him and go to another patient and
[1:03:00] pray for it across the building that
[1:03:03] pillar fires hanging over top of you now
[1:03:05] and then call them out and then go back
[1:03:09] to the man don't miss it don't miss it
[1:03:17] many times the word is a discerner of
[1:03:21] the thoughts and the intents of the
[1:03:23] heart
[1:03:24] you don't need brother Branham to call
[1:03:26] you out today or some great man to call
[1:03:29] you up the word is the discerner of our
[1:03:34] heart and when that spirit begins to
[1:03:37] draw to your heart it's your opportunity
[1:03:40] to respond
[1:03:45] that even God would think about me for
[1:03:53] all the greatness of God and all the
[1:03:57] responsibilities that he has of making
[1:04:00] the world turnin and making everything
[1:04:03] just right that Great God can can come
[1:04:09] to a service with just a handful of
[1:04:12] people sitting there and and be
[1:04:15] ministered to and then you would be the
[1:04:22] focus of that service I just have to say
[1:04:28] I find all that quite quite astounding
[1:04:34] this weeks we've had we've had an
[1:04:37] incredible turn of events
[1:04:40] riots have happened in her streets
[1:04:43] happening across the world I'm sure your
[1:04:48] world has spend just a little bit maybe
[1:04:51] on your jobs you've heard the nonsense
[1:04:54] and maybe even call some family
[1:04:57] struggles amongst you maybe even made
[1:05:00] you feel a little bit tense by it all
[1:05:04] maybe made you think things say things
[1:05:07] maybe that you normally wouldn't say
[1:05:09] that that you would feel like that you
[1:05:12] become a part of the conversation you
[1:05:15] see there's a spirit that's risen in
[1:05:18] America and across the world is the
[1:05:21] season for rapture it's a season for
[1:05:27] rapture and certain anointings are being
[1:05:30] released on the earth today
[1:05:32] you see God allow certain elements to
[1:05:37] fall into places
[1:05:39] with me God's in control of everything
[1:05:42] and he allows certain elements to fall
[1:05:45] into place it's listen to riots not a
[1:05:48] new thing it was a riot when Jesus was
[1:05:53] on the scene and he was standing there
[1:05:55] in that frail body with the crown of
[1:05:58] thorns on his head and insurrectionists
[1:06:02] were happening and they choose a man
[1:06:06] named Barabbas hurry with me and there
[1:06:11] were followers of Jesus asking the
[1:06:14] question what has Jesus died
[1:06:18] he's Hilter sick he's raised the dead
[1:06:23] what has he done that's worth covering
[1:06:27] what has he done that's worth being beat
[1:06:31] like no other human beings ever been
[1:06:34] beat they've done the message the same
[1:06:44] way they've done the message the same
[1:06:49] way I got a note this morning they're
[1:06:52] blasting brother Branham for picking up
[1:06:56] a little black baby and and and and he
[1:07:00] just uses a term you know you know that
[1:07:05] that would be unappropriate or unsocial
[1:07:08] today you know I just have to be honest
[1:07:12] with you it didn't matter that little
[1:07:16] baby was healed
[1:07:22] but the random lived in a different day
[1:07:25] but people want to character blasted
[1:07:28] today you missed the point you you
[1:07:34] missed the whole point if you want to
[1:07:37] stain him brother branham's jobs been
[1:07:39] done
[1:07:41] pray with me it's done the message has
[1:07:44] been delivered don't feel not only now
[1:07:51] no need to slamming now you're only
[1:07:55] bringing a stain on yourself people want
[1:08:01] to go back and say well Jesus never
[1:08:03] lived they want to say all different
[1:08:07] kinds of things I want to tell you he
[1:08:09] lived because I'm proof they write and
[1:08:23] here they are rioting and they don't
[1:08:27] have an answer the government don't have
[1:08:30] an answer and I know these leaders of
[1:08:34] this a nonsense don't have an answer I'm
[1:08:38] a hundred percent sure that but they're
[1:08:41] screaming for something and don't know
[1:08:44] what they're screaming for I was sharing
[1:08:48] this with Andrew this week and I said
[1:08:51] you know it's the same spirit all of the
[1:08:54] nonsense is happening but look past the
[1:08:58] riots look past of what's going on don't
[1:09:04] look at what's in the paper don't look
[1:09:07] at what's in the news there's a bride
[1:09:10] that's gathered
[1:09:20] you look past these riots you look past
[1:09:25] this covet you look past these things
[1:09:29] that you see there's a bride that's
[1:09:33] formed I'd like to just take you to with
[1:09:37] the few thoughts in there brother
[1:09:39] Branham says that Moses was that was
[1:09:44] raised by Pharaoh's daughter and of
[1:09:49] course his own mother actually was
[1:09:52] became his nurse and took care of him
[1:09:55] and she told him as a child of who he
[1:09:58] was but she could tell him but it took a
[1:10:02] revelation and he would walk past the
[1:10:07] window many times in his life brother
[1:10:11] Brennan said he would look out that
[1:10:13] window and see mud daubers out there and
[1:10:17] he would see he would see those people
[1:10:20] working and they were building they were
[1:10:24] building a huge a huge city of
[1:10:28] structures he would later become a great
[1:10:32] leader and to which that he would be
[1:10:35] overseen many things but one day
[1:10:38] brethren who said he came to that window
[1:10:42] and those mud daubers he realized that
[1:10:47] they were God's children hurry with me
[1:10:53] brother brother said he saw beyond his
[1:10:57] senses he saw beyond his senses he saw
[1:11:03] he will look beyond what he saw with his
[1:11:07] naked eye
[1:11:09] and saw the children of God a nation
[1:11:14] that was not there watching you know
[1:11:21] it's easy for us to look and I won't
[1:11:24] just kind of capture just for a moment
[1:11:26] it's easy easy for us even sitting here
[1:11:31] you're not to be careful you'll feel
[1:11:33] tangled up in this world you feel
[1:11:37] insecure you wrestle with who you are
[1:11:44] you forget who you are you you forget
[1:11:48] what God deposited on the inside of you
[1:11:53] look past your gray hair look past your
[1:11:58] glasses look past the sickness that
[1:12:01] you're fighting with in your life look
[1:12:04] past your job look past your temporary
[1:12:11] situation you're not built for this
[1:12:14] world your citizens of another Kingdom
[1:12:28] we build houses we buy cars we we have
[1:12:33] IRAs and we have we have a we have our
[1:12:37] banks never bank records and all of that
[1:12:40] means nothing at the end of the day you
[1:12:45] just become an obituaries column it's
[1:12:52] what you do and you hand off a few
[1:12:54] things and you would call treasures
[1:12:57] many times that we'll go to an auction
[1:12:59] and bring nothing literally in the
[1:13:04] things that you thought was so great
[1:13:06] became so petty people get so consumed
[1:13:11] by petty things but if we can look past
[1:13:16] the pettiness of life and looked at this
[1:13:29] point tell you it's not about what you
[1:13:31] see it's not even about what you see
[1:13:38] about yourself rather Harold Hildebrand
[1:13:43] always made a statement that I found
[1:13:45] that was so good he would say do you
[1:13:50] know why we we know that man is great he
[1:13:56] told us
[1:14:04] great men make you feel great great men
[1:14:13] make you feel great
[1:14:17] we as if with the boys were talking one
[1:14:20] day and I said you know we don't have to
[1:14:24] describe how big the Giant is were
[1:14:26] fighting today he'll tell us he'll make
[1:14:31] sure that we know that he's nine foot
[1:14:34] tall and he's got a Weaver's beam and
[1:14:36] you don't even have to pause you know
[1:14:40] David didn't measure him David didn't
[1:14:47] measure him he just made sure he had
[1:14:49] five stones are you with me maybe you
[1:14:57] would have been in the mud that Moses
[1:15:01] was looking at
[1:15:09] be from where you were standing you
[1:15:12] couldn't even see Moses maybe you were
[1:15:18] thrashing in the hay
[1:15:21] trying to make brick pulling them ropes
[1:15:29] maybe a slave master was beating you
[1:15:33] today you just happen to be the one
[1:15:36] that's picked out to be beaten at the
[1:15:40] same time God was revealing to his
[1:15:45] prophet there are my children not just
[1:15:54] to go to Kanaan's land not just to walk
[1:16:00] across the Red Sea but they're going to
[1:16:04] be in an eternal book that is written
[1:16:08] about them
[1:16:09] and some of those women that are
[1:16:12] gathering straw in the mud up to their
[1:16:15] knees are daughters of God that have an
[1:16:21] eternal purpose in the kingdom of God so
[1:16:30] in that 24-hour cycle and you're
[1:16:33] thinking you're having a bad day God's
[1:16:36] looking from another realm and what
[1:16:41] you're going through today is only
[1:16:44] temporary
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:16:55] how many times that I've heard whispered
[1:16:58] in my ears over the last few weeks
[1:17:03] Satanist whispered in my ear I have
[1:17:07] rendered you useless these are stupid
[1:17:12] death I've got you too long and you're
[1:17:17] preaching days are over with and your
[1:17:20] convention days are over with just let
[1:17:23] me catch my breath
[1:17:56] they told Andrew before they walked out
[1:17:58] here today I said there's not anything
[1:18:01] in a bottle that will make your head
[1:18:03] spin like mine spinning this morning but
[1:18:06] I'm still going out there because I'm
[1:18:12] going to remind him one of these days
[1:18:16] I'm gonna remind him one of these days
[1:18:19] when I'm standing at the end of those
[1:18:22] prayer lines
[1:18:31] sake don't wanna remind you when you
[1:18:34] cross brother branham's baby's eyes and
[1:18:37] he looked down in those eyes and it
[1:18:40] moves something in his life that you
[1:18:44] could never move away from him he said
[1:18:48] every cross-eyed baby that came across
[1:18:51] that pulpit many times I didn't even
[1:18:54] pray for them come on church sick pets
[1:19:04] on the wrong kids
[1:19:06] [Applause]
[1:19:15] saying that to say this you may be
[1:19:18] standing in the straw of life and your
[1:19:21] feet feels like it's mud all the way up
[1:19:25] to your knees and the slave masters are
[1:19:28] beating you in this temporary period
[1:19:31] just think just for a moment this is
[1:19:35] really temporary I'm not just going to
[1:19:39] Eiland I'm going to the land this world
[1:19:46] is not my home I'm just a passing
[1:19:50] through
[1:19:51] [Applause]
[1:20:00] we're being gathered here to go to
[1:20:04] another world
[1:20:08] we've been gathered here to go to
[1:20:11] another world whether it's in China when
[1:20:21] I was there and now some of those men
[1:20:26] that I gathered with us prisoners in a
[1:20:29] prison he asked the other day one of the
[1:20:38] pastors wives she was in the prayer line
[1:20:43] on the last service and so I was very
[1:20:52] concerned about her because she had some
[1:20:57] she had a situation in her life she had
[1:21:03] complexes she never wanted anybody to
[1:21:07] come to her home and her home is not
[1:21:11] like your home her home was much smaller
[1:21:14] than most of our homes it'd be it'd be
[1:21:18] about the size of half of that
[1:21:22] best of you back there maybe we've got
[1:21:27] one or two or ten or a hundred here this
[1:21:31] morning that wood has the same problem
[1:21:34] shed germophobia and so she didn't want
[1:21:39] visitors to come to her home and even
[1:21:43] when her children would go to the washer
[1:21:45] and she'd go in and clean up real
[1:21:46] quickly and and when it has been good
[1:21:50] washing heat she go and clean up real
[1:21:52] quickly and and to have a visitor in her
[1:21:55] home soon she would if you set your cup
[1:21:59] down when you picked it up she'd wipe it
[1:22:02] off she just didn't want no company
[1:22:07] wonderful sister but she had a real
[1:22:10] phobia now her husband is a pastor of
[1:22:15] the church and gathering them and you
[1:22:20] know she came in the prayer line and God
[1:22:27] was so mindful to call her out and talk
[1:22:33] to her about that phobia that was
[1:22:37] holding her back she fell on the floor
[1:22:46] but she came back up brother Tom I heard
[1:22:49] Tom asked her is he gonna be okay for us
[1:22:52] to come to your house tomorrow she said
[1:22:57] after that
[1:23:02] we look to her home maybe I shouldn't be
[1:23:07] sharing these things but we went to
[1:23:09] their home and we got tea that would be
[1:23:17] so out of the ordinary for her to let us
[1:23:20] have tea but tonight today her husband
[1:23:27] sits in prison for brother Denny
[1:23:31] carrying the Bibles you know what I'm
[1:23:34] talking about now as a matter of fact me
[1:23:40] and you would go we would go to prison
[1:23:42] now for that even for what you did we'd
[1:23:46] go to prison for what we did but when it
[1:23:54] came time for him to go to prison he
[1:23:58] didn't recant he didn't say no I'm not
[1:24:03] going to heart prison folks on me to say
[1:24:07] he could spend the rest of his life in a
[1:24:11] hard labor camp in prison it's been
[1:24:15] almost two months and he hadn't had a
[1:24:18] proper meal yet hasn't had a shower yet
[1:24:24] in those two months but in that two
[1:24:30] months he's led some people to the Lord
[1:24:36] so you got to see past what you see in
[1:24:44] America we've got it really good and we
[1:24:49] drove to church this morning Minh and
[1:24:51] we're not going to be arrested now
[1:24:56] there's no churches in China they're all
[1:24:59] busted up and I had a man tell me the
[1:25:03] other day said that sister said oh no
[1:25:07] she hasn't recanted she's down at the
[1:25:11] police station
[1:25:12] every day she's not ashamed to be called
[1:25:17] the Christian
[1:25:19] here's that dainty little woman down at
[1:25:22] the police station
[1:25:26] come on Church God give us some grit to
[1:25:30] look past what we see are you with me in
[1:25:36] the hell in that land over there that
[1:25:49] woman will be hailed as great woman he
[1:25:54] hailed as a great man and for carrying
[1:25:57] the gospel of Jesus Christ but brethren
[1:26:01] let me just say the cost is worth it the
[1:26:15] other morning night I got out of bed yes
[1:26:20] sir two days ago share this with you
[1:26:31] we're one of the tumor sets at it causes
[1:26:34] me when I go to sleep to have nightmares
[1:26:37] and those nightmares are beyond anything
[1:26:41] I ever thought a nightmare is I can go
[1:26:48] to sleep in the day and I don't have a
[1:26:50] nightmare and I can just sleep extremely
[1:26:54] deeply and fall into a deep sleep in
[1:26:57] just a few moments but at night when I
[1:27:00] lay down and I go to sleep we can pray
[1:27:05] and feel the presence of God and in just
[1:27:09] a moment go to sleep and nightmares
[1:27:12] begin to proceed because of the illness
[1:27:16] they can't remove that tumor because it
[1:27:20] would affect some very very delicate
[1:27:24] census of my body and I I don't want to
[1:27:27] I don't want to give up knowing who I am
[1:27:29] to be honest with it it's not worth
[1:27:33] trading off I want to be able to know
[1:27:35] who you I'm talking to when I preach to
[1:27:37] you and so the other morning I'd had the
[1:27:41] presence of the Lord in my home and when
[1:27:44] I went back to sleep he I dreamed the
[1:27:47] most horrendous nightmare that they've
[1:27:52] dreamed in the whole period of time and
[1:27:54] I woke up and Connie was coming in the
[1:27:58] room and I just have to be honest with
[1:28:01] you I begin to scream out why me God
[1:28:05] what am I going through this why me
[1:28:09] I was just thankful to wake up and that
[1:28:15] that wasn't real Connie cried with me
[1:28:19] and holding me and I walk into the
[1:28:23] washroom and I get it on the note I was
[1:28:33] gonna save it for another time but some
[1:28:35] things won't save and here were the
[1:28:40] words that came for me even for one
[1:28:50] you go through this even just for one
[1:28:54] yeah and I said I just apologized very
[1:29:00] quickly i falled yes so quickly brother
[1:29:09] branham said he said God would come to
[1:29:12] the earth and be hungry like a man and
[1:29:20] they'd spit on him they make fun of him
[1:29:24] and he'd go to Calvary for one
[1:29:42] and sorry I don't have everything just
[1:29:44] together just like maybe as polish to
[1:29:48] say I say normal yeah but it's okay
[1:30:08] I would just want to share this with you
[1:30:11] I'm glad God held this trial to this
[1:30:14] period of my life
[1:30:29] so I would get the deeper purpose of it
[1:30:39] cuz two months earlier I was chasing the
[1:30:42] dollar trying to make away from my
[1:30:47] family but all that's taken care of I
[1:30:57] stood on the stage with Gary Walker in
[1:31:01] New Zealand one time
[1:31:05] Gary had been crushed in an accident and
[1:31:09] he went through a horrendous rehab for a
[1:31:12] year and he made a statement that was
[1:31:17] astounding
[1:31:18] he said I'd do it all again if I could
[1:31:22] help one person
[1:31:33] I would say that would be the case now
[1:31:38] for me
[1:31:44] I would say that when they were taking
[1:31:59] Jesus's life
[1:32:09] different people saw different things
[1:32:21] some saw a religious man a
[1:32:26] self-proclaimed prophet died some saw
[1:32:34] insurrectionist maybe even a political
[1:32:39] opponent self-proclaimed king Diane Mary
[1:32:52] knew what she was looking at she knew
[1:33:03] what she was seeing her mind's eye was
[1:33:12] much further than a natural little boy
[1:33:16] that he grew up in her home she'd met
[1:33:21] the angel of the Lord she was there when
[1:33:26] it all supernaturally happened and she
[1:33:32] standing watching him and as he's
[1:33:38] finishing up and he screams it is
[1:33:42] finished listen wait screams it is
[1:33:48] finished the earth itself the people
[1:33:55] that was standing on it couldn't realize
[1:33:59] the full volume of what it just happened
[1:34:05] this who is Jesus brother Ray had now
[1:34:10] paid the price of redemption
[1:34:15] he lifts me now he had now paid the
[1:34:20] price of redemption and now he could
[1:34:23] restore the order completely back to the
[1:34:26] errors he could bring man back into
[1:34:32] fellowship again and reconcile us back
[1:34:38] and with me and he was paying a price
[1:34:43] that no man could pay how did they put
[1:34:54] him there on the cross three things he
[1:34:58] said he was God He healed on the Sabbath
[1:35:05] they accused him of things that was
[1:35:08] trivial trivial and when Jesus was
[1:35:17] standing there in front of Pilate and
[1:35:20] all of the screams that was happening
[1:35:23] Barabbas Barabbas Barabbas this man's
[1:35:27] atmosphere was so powerful unto which
[1:35:32] pilot couldn't hear the screams
[1:35:37] he was enough I'll never forget one
[1:35:42] night I was in bed and I heard a voice
[1:35:45] speak to me and they said go and pull
[1:35:51] out a book this book was in the 1800s
[1:35:55] written and they said I'd never read the
[1:35:59] book and I pulled it out and I opened it
[1:36:01] up and now you're going to get a part
[1:36:03] you've heard it before but it opened up
[1:36:07] and it says that and he was taking it
[1:36:10] from some historical writings said
[1:36:15] Pilate standing in the realm of the
[1:36:18] great Jesus
[1:36:20] atmosphere and the world was upside down
[1:36:25] around them but his atmosphere was so
[1:36:28] tremendous and to which he could say I
[1:36:34] find no fault in this man hallelujah
[1:36:44] what an atmosphere of who Jesus really
[1:36:47] is what an atmosphere of who Jesus
[1:36:51] really is let me just say this to you
[1:36:54] tonight if I could just finish with them
[1:36:58] with a couple quotations if we could
[1:37:03] look at him
[1:37:06] that's him in creation we can go back to
[1:37:12] the beginning that was him putting
[1:37:16] everything together just his presence
[1:37:21] his creation we watched in turn water
[1:37:25] into one we watched him take fish and
[1:37:30] feed 5,000 people and twelve baskets
[1:37:34] leftover that's a physics lesson and I
[1:37:39] can't imagine what as brother and said
[1:37:42] that little boy that missed school that
[1:37:46] seeing beyond what you see that's him
[1:37:51] and the power of his creation how that
[1:37:54] he can take one tenth of what you give
[1:37:59] back to him and take that one tenth and
[1:38:04] bless you beyond all your neighbors
[1:38:10] don't even try to explain it don't even
[1:38:14] try to explain how God does business but
[1:38:19] God can take one tenth of your income
[1:38:22] and bless you beyond I was standing one
[1:38:37] time and it was dealing with a
[1:38:40] businessman that it came to her house
[1:38:43] and he was just looking around he said
[1:38:48] how did you get what you got I said one
[1:38:50] tenth how'd you get what you got I said
[1:38:57] one death I said no I I don't I I I've
[1:39:02] got a salary I'll get a salary I said I
[1:39:06] didn't get this with my salary I said
[1:39:09] but I got this with one tenth I found
[1:39:13] the bank world gives you a hundred
[1:39:16] percent on one tenth and it's not
[1:39:24] overseas somewhere another he will bless
[1:39:28] you beyond what you will ever look
[1:39:35] around yourself and point to some things
[1:39:39] in your life brother Steve and go that's
[1:39:42] him when things are spinning out of
[1:39:46] control and you don't have control no
[1:39:49] more and God's actually moving your
[1:39:52] world
[1:39:55] he's moving your world and he's open and
[1:39:59] doors and closing doors and you stop and
[1:40:02] go what is going on in my life just
[1:40:07] simply take this thought from this
[1:40:09] morning service that's him
[1:40:14] but rather on it looks like your life's
[1:40:16] in chaos you're looking at the wrong
[1:40:18] thing that's him but your life is
[1:40:25] spinning out of control
[1:40:27] oh no that's he I'm I'm speaking from a
[1:40:33] deeper realm than I've ever spoke in my
[1:40:36] life because I can look at things now
[1:40:40] that I see and say that's him
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:46] not something 2,000 years ago today
[1:40:51] yesterday this week that's him
[1:40:58] when the doctor looks and say tumors are
[1:41:01] shrinking that's him
[1:41:03] [Applause]
[1:41:11] if we should go back to Bethlehem and
[1:41:14] look at the scene don't pity what you
[1:41:17] see don't pity him heaven delay in the
[1:41:22] manger
[1:41:22] it's fulfilling Scripture God don't need
[1:41:26] to pity he's not going to invite kings
[1:41:30] and potentates to his birth he's
[1:41:34] bringing shepherds to his birth because
[1:41:37] that's him even had to explain his birth
[1:41:44] now but that's him I'd like to tell you
[1:41:51] whether it would be in in a little place
[1:41:56] in North Carolina walking out on the
[1:41:59] stage with Henry Greene sitting on the
[1:42:02] platform and he said when brother
[1:42:05] Branham walked up on the stage he said
[1:42:07] he'd saw the great a a Alan's walk on
[1:42:10] the stage people applauded their
[1:42:13] personalities and applauded who they are
[1:42:16] and wanna feel overwhelmed at this great
[1:42:19] man he said but when we and Brandon were
[1:42:22] walked on the stage he said all I could
[1:42:25] do was sit there and weep you see beyond
[1:42:32] the land beyond that man was him oh no
[1:42:42] brother Branham wouldn't God no more
[1:42:47] than neither of you and I and I could
[1:42:54] say this this morning if you turn to
[1:42:58] your neighbor and you go oh I feel so
[1:43:01] sorry for them what they're going
[1:43:03] through or your head dogs just a little
[1:43:08] bit and goes poor old brother Ron he
[1:43:11] must have sinned to have to go through
[1:43:13] something like this
[1:43:14] oh you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:43:19] what you're seeing is God at work in
[1:43:24] humanity of you you see and st. John
[1:43:38] chapter 6 and 15 he controls disasters
[1:43:44] whether Donnie he controls great
[1:43:48] difficulties in our lives never forget
[1:43:57] when you came to the Lord you made a
[1:44:04] statement to me I'll lose it
[1:44:06] I'll lose a lot of things my statement
[1:44:10] back to you you've lost a lot of things
[1:44:12] in this world but you gained in Jesus

[1:46:09] tell you to put that on your heart that

[1:56:04] because that Eagle can fly higher than
[1:56:08] any other bird there's a lot of things
[1:56:12] that other birds just see on the surface
[1:56:14] they can't get no higher than a mountain
[1:56:17] that's just what they say
[1:56:21] but you are not called to be just
[1:56:23] another bird you are an old God I heard
[1:56:28] a prophet scream out and tell me that I
[1:56:31] M&E
[1:56:33] you're an eagle for gospel lighthouse
[1:56:36] there things that you were called to
[1:56:39] rise above fly higher and higher you go
[1:56:43] the more you'll see oh if we could just
[1:56:48] get our eyes off of these things the
[1:56:52] things that we see what a God that we
[1:56:55] serve that would come and tell us that
[1:56:59] our light affliction which is but for a
[1:57:02] long look not at the things that you see
[1:57:07] for the things that you see are temporal
[1:57:09] but the things that you do not see are
[1:57:13] return now God told us that he'd be here
[1:57:17] this morning now I probably say that 99%
[1:57:22] of you didn't see God in his spirit
[1:57:26] realm or a pillar of fire near this
[1:57:28] morning but just because you didn't see
[1:57:31] him does not mean whatsoever that it
[1:57:34] wasn't here for he told me and he told
[1:57:39] you that I'll never leave you and I'll
[1:57:42] never forsake you so we can look past
[1:57:45] what we see here
[1:57:46] gheh haze' take your eyes off what you
[1:57:50] see
[1:57:51] and look to that unseen rail and in that
[1:57:54] realm is everything that you have need
[1:57:57] of this morning in that realm just a
[1:57:59] little bit further is healing
[1:58:02] deliverance it's everything that you
[1:58:04] have need of in this life's journey they
[1:58:07] said they're right before you you know
[1:58:10] they tell us that if that if a snake
[1:58:12] catches a bird's attention and he can
[1:58:16] gather his attention and and he grabs
[1:58:19] ahold of him that little bird will
[1:58:21] flutter and he can't get away in that
[1:58:22] snake or grab it but if that bird can
[1:58:26] get its eye off of that serpent and look
[1:58:29] upward he can fly away to where he was
[1:58:33] called to fly if we can get our eyes off
[1:58:36] of the serpent and look to what we were
[1:58:40] born to do Oh what places will go little
[1:58:44] Eagles maybe we sing that song this
[1:58:47] morning I'm coming back to the heart of
[1:58:49] worship as we would go forward in this
[1:58:53] service this morning
