[26:55] and we had a reunion and out of those
[26:58] 21-3 have died very young men 22 52
[27:03] and about 50. all from some type of
[27:07] brain disease
[27:09] when we were there over there the the
[27:11] tanks would shoot
[27:13] these rounds and these rounds would come
[27:15] out and when they uh it's just like a
[27:17] gun when you shoot a gun you pull the
[27:19] cartridge out well they had a cartridge
[27:21] great big thing and it was about that
[27:23] big and so what it was they had a trap
[27:24] door and a tank and it would drop down
[27:26] on the ground well they had a uranium in
[27:29] them and so what do these guys do they
[27:31] got a hold of them they would pick them
[27:33] up and use them as souvenirs and they

[54:43] you'll have to wait
[54:45] to eat those donuts still afterwards or
[54:52] thank you
[54:54] thank you for allowing us to uh
[54:57] share this life together and uh the
[55:01] reason we know how to give is because
[55:03] our Lord Jesus Christ showed us the
[55:06] power of giving and I was thinking today
[55:08] before we come to church and begin to
[55:10] think about
[55:11] about the scripture that said to
[55:14] to receive a prophet is to receive a
[55:16] prophet's reward
[55:17] mother Branham said that he said what
[55:19] that reward is is to receive him as a
[55:22] friend to be the friend of a prophet and
[55:24] you remember when brother Branham was
[55:26] there and he's that that black or the
[55:28] black mom was chasing him he's going
[55:30] after his friend
[55:32] and all of a sudden he he stopped him
[55:35] and he started coming back to him I'm
[55:37] glad
[55:38] that there was a prophet that stood up
[55:39] for us
[55:41] that stood up for us and to think that
[55:44] we we receive this Prophet this
[55:47] prophet's message and to to be a friend
[55:49] of a prophet that that a prophet stood
[55:51] there and called and we recognized it
[55:54] was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:55] that broke the power of that mamba you
[55:59] know we we watched it in our Lord Jesus
[56:00] Christ we've watched it in brother
[56:02] Branham the the sacrifice of given we've
[56:04] watched it in our pastor brother Ron and
[56:06] to to me we're just one of the most
[56:09] blessed people that there is upon the
[56:11] face of the Earth to be standing and
[56:13] living in this hour and to have a pastor
[56:15] like brother Ron I tell you I
[56:18] the Lord sure has been good to us and
[56:21] those are His blessings amen
[56:24] amen
[56:26] thank you thank you sister Anna Sister
[56:29] Barbara sister Carly for for all the
[56:31] things that you've done these little
[56:33] children they have our hearts and and my

[57:04] just just thank you for all all the
[57:07] prayers that have went up for us and the
[57:09] meetings this past weekend my goodness
[57:11] the Lord certainly blessed us in a very
[57:14] Supernatural way and uh brother Ron I
[57:17] know we'll be making some statements
[57:19] about that but just to before we change
[57:21] here the order
[57:24] I just want to remind you that tomorrow

[57:29] of Fellowship
[57:30] it's a day that we remember one another
[57:33] and you know take time to sit down and
[57:35] spend time with ones that you don't
[57:38] typically do Fellowship around the

[58:25] service and so tomorrow we're going to
[58:28] open open that up for if you have a
[58:30] testimony don't share your whole life
[58:32] but if you've got something that that
[58:33] the Lord has done for you that feel like
[58:35] it would be a blessing to somebody else
[58:37] maybe a short three four minute clip or
[58:40] a testimony there and I know it would be
[58:43] a real blessing to us and my goodness to
[58:46] hear the report of her brother Donnie we
[58:48] received that
[58:50] we received that Monday morning as we

[59:14] availeth much and and uh
[59:19] tonight I want to
[59:21] I want to sing a song that
[59:24] that was seen last weekend at brother
[59:26] Tim's October meetings there and
[59:29] the Lord certainly blessed us in a very
[59:31] Supernatural way we've seen so many
[59:33] Supernatural things happen and just Just
[59:36] Amazing Just an amazing thing to watch

[59:58] pants if you're down in the dumps and uh
[1:00:00] this man right here has been used by
[1:00:03] almighty God to beat down every excuse
[1:00:05] that the enemy would try to throw in
[1:00:09] make us want to miss church
[1:00:11] but we watch this man weekend after
[1:00:14] weekend sick whether he's sick or not
[1:00:17] he's coming to this pulpit and he and

[1:00:29] times it's one of the most dynamic
[1:00:31] messages I've ever heard in my life and
[1:00:33] and just uh just a powerful powerful
[1:00:36] message I believe that the season of
[1:00:37] change is upon us as the body of Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ and and uh last weekend brother
[1:00:43] Michael had sang a song brother Michael
[1:00:45] Dexter had sang the song and uh
[1:00:49] I believe it was the first time them
[1:00:51] singing it there
[1:00:52] and uh my the presence of the Lord just
[1:00:55] dropped into the room and
[1:00:57] and he he's singing I believe two times
[1:00:59] there and every single time the Lord
[1:01:02] just dropped into the room and he asked
[1:01:05] me later he said are you going to sing
[1:01:06] that song I said man I said
[1:01:08] after the presence of the Lord fell like
[1:01:10] that I almost feel commissioned that we
[1:01:12] need to do so and you ever been into a

[1:15:36] where a man has got chains and naked
[1:15:39] and love him enough
[1:15:42] to change his life
[1:15:44] and he went there with a mission
[1:15:47] he can go to a place where they won't
[1:15:49] wash his feet
[1:15:51] because he knows there's going to be
[1:15:53] somebody there
[1:15:56] she won't be accepted by the rest of the
[1:15:59] churches
[1:16:01] but he'll accept her
[1:16:03] and after today

[1:16:28] looking for us

[1:16:32] and he didn't stop when you turned and
[1:16:34] even walked away
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:37] he knew there'd come a season
[1:16:40] where you would turn and
[1:16:42] it then he would call you
[1:16:45] like he did to the woman
[1:16:48] at his grave
[1:16:50] Mary
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:16:55] a woman with the worst sins
[1:16:57] of all Humanity

[1:19:52] afternoon but I want to read the
[1:19:53] scripture

[1:20:06] started
[1:20:08] as the Lord would give us strength
[1:20:12] we find this is the closing of the
[1:20:15] scriptures
[1:20:16] and John is coming to the end to where
[1:20:20] the fullness of all things would be
[1:20:22] and this is our time
[1:20:25] and John is writing about you writing
[1:20:27] about what is laying ahead of you
[1:20:30] listen we've got good news the world is
[1:20:32] falling apart
[1:20:34] they're headed into a tribulation period
[1:20:36] but we've got some really good news here
[1:20:38] and so
[1:20:39] amen and so I just want to just want to
[1:20:42] share a few things with you if you could
[1:20:44] just help me tonight and I saw a new
[1:20:47] Heaven and a new Earth
[1:20:50] for the first Heaven and the first Earth
[1:20:53] were passed away and there was no more
[1:20:55] sea
[1:20:56] and I John saw the holy city the New
[1:20:59] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:21:01] heaven
[1:21:03] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:21:06] husband
[1:21:07] and I heard a great voice out of Heaven
[1:21:09] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:21:12] with men
[1:21:13] and he will dwell with them and they
[1:21:15] shall be his people and God himself
[1:21:17] shall be with them and be their God
[1:21:20] and God shall wipe away all tears from
[1:21:23] their eyes and there shall be no more
[1:21:25] death neither sorrow nor crying neither
[1:21:29] shall there be any more pain for former
[1:21:32] things are passed away and he that set
[1:21:34] upon the throne said behold I make all
[1:21:37] things new
[1:21:39] and he said unto me right for these
[1:21:41] words are true and faithful and he said
[1:21:45] unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega
[1:21:47] the beginning and the end and I will
[1:21:50] give unto him that is a thirst of the
[1:21:52] Fountain of Water of Life freely and he
[1:21:56] that overcometh how many of you say
[1:21:58] that's now I'm one of them
[1:22:01] shall inherit all things
[1:22:04] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:22:07] son
[1:22:08] but the fearful unbelieving abominable
[1:22:12] murderers whoremongers Sorcerers
[1:22:16] idolaters all liars shall have their
[1:22:20] part in the Lake of Fire which burns
[1:22:23] with fire and brimstone which is the
[1:22:26] second death you may be seated this
[1:22:28] afternoon
[1:22:38] foreign
[1:22:42] I want to share this with you
[1:22:45] sister Connie Perry
[1:22:48] made me this
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] isn't that beautiful
[1:22:56] amen she said when I go to the brother
[1:22:59] Fred said when I will come over on this
[1:23:01] site now
[1:23:03] said when I go to the hospital it'll
[1:23:05] keep me warm
[1:23:06] well
[1:23:07] all right that'll that'll do because
[1:23:09] their little old sheets won't keep you
[1:23:11] keep you warm
[1:23:13] amen when they say I'll get you a warm
[1:23:15] blanket I'll take two
[1:23:18] and so amen thank you sister Connie give
[1:23:21] her a good hand for that
[1:23:31] for most of us that have been around the
[1:23:34] message for decades and
[1:23:37] I've been around the message since I was
[1:23:39] a little boy
[1:23:41] we have been watching the bride's
[1:23:43] Revival escalate
[1:23:46] we have watched it move from cycle to
[1:23:49] cycle the opening of the word began to
[1:23:51] happen somewhere around the 80s and and
[1:23:54] the word just began to open itself up to
[1:23:57] the Bride of Jesus Christ and it became
[1:23:59] an unfolding revelation
[1:24:01] we realized that we were the people of
[1:24:04] the open book citizens of another
[1:24:06] kingdom we realized that this was more
[1:24:10] than the message of a man of William
[1:24:12] Branham this was not going to be a
[1:24:14] denomination
[1:24:15] we realized that it wasn't going to
[1:24:17] return us to Azusa Street
[1:24:20] the Revival of Pentecost of of the 1900s
[1:24:24] but it's returning us back to Acts 2.
[1:24:29] it's returned us back to where God is
[1:24:32] inside of man and the adoption of sons
[1:24:35] and daughters have come together we
[1:24:38] realize that we're a part of that that
[1:24:41] we've returned to Eden again
[1:24:43] and so we as we have watched these
[1:24:47] things and we see our meetings become so
[1:24:51] much more powerful we came through
[1:24:53] Seasons to where that personalities of
[1:24:56] men would rise up and and people would
[1:24:59] follow personalities who's going to be
[1:25:01] the next great one well let me just say
[1:25:03] there's none greater than Jesus Christ
[1:25:06] we're not wanting to build a kingdom
[1:25:10] we're not wanting to build a kingdom
[1:25:12] after ourselves we're wanting to build a
[1:25:14] kingdom of Jesus Christ and we're
[1:25:17] Christians we want we want him to live
[1:25:19] inside of our lives
[1:25:21] we have we have witnessed over the last
[1:25:24] months and even the last couple of years
[1:25:26] phenomenal miracles happen here
[1:25:29] we witnessed tonight brother Donnie
[1:25:31] talking about being
[1:25:33] being free of cancer
[1:25:35] and and we've witnessed that the God is
[1:25:38] just just watched over him
[1:25:41] brother Alden and I were standing in the
[1:25:43] back of in the back back there just
[1:25:45] getting ready to come out and he was
[1:25:47] talking about those 21 Men
[1:25:50] brother Alden made a statement I think
[1:25:52] he was reading my mind he said those 21
[1:25:55] Men preserved their lives because of no
[1:25:58] doubt Donnie was there
[1:26:00] Donnie had a daddy that was praying for
[1:26:03] him
[1:26:04] Donnie would be a Christian man that
[1:26:06] would be on this stage that would play
[1:26:08] the music and and Satan couldn't take
[1:26:11] his life
[1:26:15] and no doubt the angel of the Lord was
[1:26:17] very near to watch over him and and
[1:26:20] protect him
[1:26:21] we witnessed that we witnessed that
[1:26:24] tonight as we said here sometimes when
[1:26:26] we hear phenomenal Miracles we we we go
[1:26:30] well isn't that nice or isn't that what
[1:26:32] we don't realize that was God
[1:26:37] that was God doing a work and so we're
[1:26:41] thanking for that
[1:26:44] last year we had was it last year or two
[1:26:47] years ago we had brother Timothy Pruitt
[1:26:49] here
[1:26:50] was it last year or two years two years
[1:26:53] sister Karen just before sister Karen's
[1:26:56] passing last June June
[1:26:59] August
[1:27:03] okay
[1:27:04] and so brother Timothy was preaching
[1:27:08] and brother brother Timothy as he was
[1:27:10] preaching he was
[1:27:11] he was coming down to the end of his
[1:27:13] service
[1:27:15] and sister Karen was in the hospital
[1:27:17] with her brain bleed and she had been
[1:27:20] fighting with brain bleeds and it's
[1:27:22] coming now close to the end of her to
[1:27:25] her passing to her homegoing brother
[1:27:27] Timothy has an iPad just like I have
[1:27:29] here
[1:27:30] and he's out in front of the stage and
[1:27:32] he's he's talking about God's doing
[1:27:34] something
[1:27:35] and so as he's beginning to speak about
[1:27:37] it
[1:27:38] we were sitting there and I was watching
[1:27:41] his iPad go from one app to another app
[1:27:46] how many has an iPad or an iPhone
[1:27:49] you realize that that don't do that by
[1:27:52] itself
[1:27:54] and so I told I told the guys here I
[1:27:57] said the angel of the Lord is standing
[1:28:00] at the pulpit
[1:28:02] hey
[1:28:03] and he's went from one app to another
[1:28:06] app
[1:28:07] and he's going to a certain place in the
[1:28:10] message
[1:28:12] to play
[1:28:14] and brother Timothy didn't know how it
[1:28:16] was happening
[1:28:18] and he didn't even grasp a hold of what
[1:28:21] was really going on but he began to talk
[1:28:23] about the man that that that that that
[1:28:26] wrote this song down from his glory
[1:28:30] and
[1:28:31] and they begin to talk about that song
[1:28:33] and
[1:28:34] as brother Timothy would go home
[1:28:37] it would be it would be sister Karen's
[1:28:40] one of her last last actions in her body
[1:28:43] which she would sing the song down from
[1:28:46] his glory
[1:28:51] we have witnessed him come to us in this
[1:28:54] generation
[1:28:57] we have witnessed God on the scene for
[1:29:00] us
[1:29:01] we have seen him
[1:29:04] December the 22nd of 2022 of 2020.
[1:29:09] he spoke to us
[1:29:12] that if you'll trust me I'll use you
[1:29:14] like never before
[1:29:17] we have trusted him
[1:29:19] maybe thinking that it would be maybe a
[1:29:21] a higher realm of ministry or or higher
[1:29:24] gift of that but
[1:29:26] it would be cancer would come to our
[1:29:29] body
[1:29:30] and it would be one level at another and
[1:29:32] we would discover it
[1:29:34] through through a Mennonite doctor here
[1:29:37] that's that's local and a dear friend to
[1:29:39] us all
[1:29:40] and he would tell me that it was going
[1:29:42] down a dark Road and and then
[1:29:45] at first he thought it was prostate
[1:29:47] cancer
[1:29:48] and then it was in the lung then it was
[1:29:51] in the lymph nodes
[1:29:52] and then and then after a few a couple
[1:29:55] of months we would find out it was in
[1:29:57] the brain
[1:30:01] a death sentence was give to us
[1:30:10] but God is the one that has the final
[1:30:12] report
[1:30:18] about a two weeks ago we were sitting
[1:30:20] with the doctors and they were just
[1:30:22] saying
[1:30:24] we're just blown away of what all you're
[1:30:26] doing
[1:30:29] and so as I Was preparing this message I
[1:30:33] thought you know
[1:30:35] after hearing brother Donnie's
[1:30:37] brother Donnie's words of a testimony
[1:30:42] I think I'd like to give a little
[1:30:44] testimony of this year
[1:30:49] I'm not going to go back to last year
[1:30:50] but I'm going to give a little testimony
[1:30:52] of this year
[1:30:53] we stood at your meetings at brother
[1:30:55] Sean's
[1:30:57] and spoke to about 1100 people
[1:31:01] and we spoke a sermon called nothing can
[1:31:03] stop us
[1:31:06] and the prayer line went to about two
[1:31:08] o'clock in the morning
[1:31:11] and on the way home
[1:31:17] they begin to speak in tongues
[1:31:20] and God began to pour out his glory
[1:31:23] amongst our people
[1:31:26] God just continued to Pour That Glory
[1:31:28] out over and over again
[1:31:31] it was there I think sister of Julia
[1:31:34] began to speak in tongues
[1:31:37] we had went to Easter camp with brother
[1:31:40] Tim Pruitt
[1:31:41] and that would be with brother Andrew
[1:31:43] and myself
[1:31:45] and brother Donnie would be there
[1:31:49] and one phenomenal Miracle after another
[1:31:51] happened in that meeting
[1:31:53] and on that stage we had a prayer line
[1:31:55] and it was the first prayer line that I
[1:31:58] was able to stand through the whole
[1:32:00] prayer line
[1:32:02] and brother Tim Pruitt and myself danced
[1:32:04] at the end of it
[1:32:07] and they were singing a song you don't
[1:32:09] know like I know
[1:32:20] then I brother Harold Hildebrandt would
[1:32:22] pass and I would want to go to his place
[1:32:24] but I was in a weakened condition and
[1:32:27] just could not go two weeks later
[1:32:30] we went to Brother biscal's meeting for
[1:32:34] his 50th Anniversary meeting

[1:32:47] incredible things
[1:32:49] once again a prayer line would ensue
[1:32:52] once again brother Tim and I would dance

[1:39:05] with us at the meeting last week at
[1:39:07] brother Tim's
[1:39:10] he couldn't come
[1:39:12] but God orchestrates everything
[1:39:17] when the meeting was over with brother
[1:39:19] Tim got a a letter
[1:39:23] and and brother Kalin from South Africa
[1:39:28] sent a picture with his letter
[1:39:35] and this was the picture that he sent
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:57] he said God bless you brother Tim I
[1:39:59] asked brother Tim if I could read it I
[1:40:01] didn't ask brother Kalin I felt like he
[1:40:03] was far enough away
[1:40:05] if he watches this he's not going to hit
[1:40:07] me with a dart no way
[1:40:10] God bless you brother Tim I'm sure you
[1:40:12] must be really tired after such powerful
[1:40:14] week of services may the Lord bless you
[1:40:16] for all your benefits and reward you
[1:40:19] with health and strength all I can say
[1:40:22] is evening light Tabernacle has waged
[1:40:24] War
[1:40:26] Wayne Andrew and Ron
[1:40:29] on the kingdom of hell that saw the
[1:40:32] bride realize that she is Anointed and
[1:40:34] he now he begins to take the sermon
[1:40:36] titles and themes of the sermon and
[1:40:38] begins to blend it together on the
[1:40:41] kingdom of hell and saw the bride
[1:40:43] realize that she is the anointed to
[1:40:46] accept what Eve turned down
[1:40:49] this has made her cry out let's finish
[1:40:53] this
[1:40:54] for she is an is the anointed body bride
[1:40:59] body of the Lord Jesus Christ she is now
[1:41:03] feeling the effect of the vision
[1:41:07] and as it draws Dawns on her Satan has
[1:41:11] underestimated her all of those were our
[1:41:15] texts
[1:41:17] for he cannot stop her from stepping
[1:41:21] into the mystery of change
[1:41:27] oh Hallelujah
[1:41:30] Hallelujah you hit me wonderful
[1:41:34] we had with us Belgium from Belgium
[1:41:36] brother Joshua and brother Isaiah and
[1:41:39] and and and and sister Julie that is
[1:41:42] from Brother Guido's family
[1:41:45] Joshua has now been preaching seven
[1:41:47] years
[1:41:48] and it was in a meeting as I walked by
[1:41:51] him I turned to him and said God's
[1:41:52] calling you to preach he has now
[1:41:54] preached seven years
[1:41:56] Isaiah was not a Christian in one of
[1:41:59] Guido's prayers to us was
[1:42:01] pray that my son Isaiah and his his wife
[1:42:05] that are that are that are in a broken
[1:42:08] situation pray that they become
[1:42:10] Christians
[1:42:11] in the meeting last week
[1:42:14] they were all at the altar
[1:42:17] and as Isaiah was worshiping with the
[1:42:19] hundreds of people I just began to say
[1:42:21] you're standing a Holy Ground at the
[1:42:23] same time sister Julie is standing there
[1:42:26] and she feels a hand on her shoulder
[1:42:29] and later they would come to find out
[1:42:32] what nobody ever lay in a hand on her
[1:42:34] shoulder but it was a supernatural God
[1:42:37] [Applause]
[1:42:46] now
[1:42:50] people don't believe in Visions you just
[1:42:53] put your fingers in your ears just now
[1:42:56] but us three preaching the meeting had
[1:42:59] significance
[1:43:00] we never preached a meeting before in
[1:43:03] this quite this way
[1:43:04] and so brother Wayne myself and brother
[1:43:09] Andrew are going to speak
[1:43:11] and so anyway
[1:43:14] we
[1:43:16] in in the vision before I had saw that
[1:43:19] we had black pants and white shirt
[1:43:21] and we walked into a place and and in in
[1:43:24] this place we we walked into we walked
[1:43:27] into it and we would eat a honey bun
[1:43:35] well Wayne had asked his wife to pack
[1:43:37] him a blue shirt and it was dirty so he
[1:43:41] wore a white shirt
[1:43:44] so
[1:43:46] on the way to the restaurant brother Tim
[1:43:49] tells you he says this place it's about
[1:43:52] an hour out this place has the most
[1:43:55] incredible cinnamon buns that you can
[1:43:57] eat
[1:43:59] we would see the picture on it as we
[1:44:01] walk in
[1:44:02] and we would walk to the counter that I
[1:44:05] saw in the vision
[1:44:10] and they didn't have cinnamon rolls
[1:44:13] they had cinnamon buns
[1:44:17] so I ordered 12 to make sure
[1:44:28] Hallelujah
[1:44:31] I believe we're standing on some
[1:44:33] incredible grounds don't you
[1:44:37] do we have time to preach a little bit
[1:44:42] since we're not going to have service
[1:44:43] tomorrow we're going to have Shirley
[1:44:45] with us
[1:44:46] sister Nancy's cousin yeah yeah
[1:44:49] amen
[1:44:54] I want to share a couple of quotes with
[1:44:56] you
[1:44:58] what a beautiful picture of Christ
[1:45:02] who heard from Heaven that we were lost
[1:45:06] and came and pursued the enemy
[1:45:09] all the way to hell
[1:45:12] and captured the lost soul and brought
[1:45:14] us back and restored us to everything
[1:45:17] that we had before the fall
[1:45:21] we backsliders we that were born to be
[1:45:24] sons of God that's perverted into sons
[1:45:27] of the devil and when when after the
[1:45:30] things of the world and done wrong and
[1:45:32] run into greedily like lot did selling
[1:45:35] out our birthrights and going after the
[1:45:37] things of the world Christ come down
[1:45:41] Christ come down through though Fallen
[1:45:45] God knowed in the beginning who would be
[1:45:49] saved and who would not
[1:45:52] therefore God come down and pursued the
[1:45:55] enemy notice how he says it God came
[1:45:57] down and pursued the enemy through life
[1:46:00] through death through Paradise into hell
[1:46:04] and all the way from God to Hell glory
[1:46:08] to hell he took over the powers of hell
[1:46:10] and the keys await took the keys away
[1:46:13] from the devil and rose again and
[1:46:16] restored mankind
[1:46:19] that he can be Sons and Daughters of God
[1:46:24] again
[1:46:25] that's what God did for me and you
[1:46:30] God left Glory
[1:46:35] God left glory and went to the ramparts
[1:46:38] of hell
[1:46:40] to defeat hell that it could restore us
[1:46:43] back to be sons and daughters again
[1:46:50] for those that don't know why I repeated
[1:46:52] what we've done in the last year I say
[1:46:54] take that devil
[1:46:57] foreign
[1:47:20] gives you a death sentence do something
[1:47:22] with it turn it right around on him
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:28] when they tell me nobody else is doing
[1:47:30] what you're doing I'm telling you
[1:47:31] there's a God that knows how to restore
[1:47:34] my body
[1:47:35] what hell wanted to take away from me
[1:47:38] God has restored and God gives us
[1:47:41] strength
[1:47:45] what I believe Adam walked out of we're
[1:47:48] going to walk right back into we have
[1:47:51] walked right back into
[1:47:54] I believe that heaven is a real place
[1:47:57] just the same as this is a real place
[1:47:59] for God started Us in this spiritual
[1:48:02] growth in this place I believe that
[1:48:05] heaven is a place just as real as this
[1:48:07] is where we don't go up there for
[1:48:10] eternity and just sit up there on the
[1:48:12] cloud and strum a harp and all of this
[1:48:14] and that and the other he said but we're
[1:48:17] going to a real place where we're going
[1:48:19] to to do things where we're going to
[1:48:22] live where are we going to work where
[1:48:24] we're going to enjoy where we're going
[1:48:26] to live we're going to have life real
[1:48:30] eternal life we're going to heaven a
[1:48:33] paradise
[1:48:34] just like Adam and Eve worked that live
[1:48:37] that eat that enjoined the Garden of
[1:48:40] Eden before sin ever came
[1:48:42] we're on our road back there
[1:48:47] we're not done here we're on our way
[1:48:49] back there
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:53] in the Garden of Eden before sin came in
[1:48:56] we're on road back there again
[1:48:58] the first Adam through sin taken us out
[1:49:01] the second Adam
[1:49:04] Jesus Christ through righteousness
[1:49:07] brings us back again
[1:49:10] justifies us as though we never did it
[1:49:14] in the first place
[1:49:18] Revelations chapter 5 and verse 9. if
[1:49:22] you'll notice in Revelations chapter 5.
[1:49:25] God's there
[1:49:27] man's there
[1:49:29] but there's somebody's missing
[1:49:32] the Accuser
[1:49:38] and they sung a new song
[1:49:41] Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to
[1:49:44] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:49:47] slain
[1:49:48] and has redeemed us to God by the blood
[1:49:51] out of every Kindred tongue and people
[1:49:54] and Nation
[1:49:55] and it's made us unto our Gods Kings and
[1:49:58] Priests and we shall reign upon the
[1:50:03] Earth
[1:50:09] don't that make you feel good
[1:50:14] and I beheld and I heard the voice of
[1:50:17] many angels and the round and their
[1:50:19] Thorn and the Beast and the elders
[1:50:21] and the number of them's Ten Thousand
[1:50:23] Times Ten Thousand and thousands and
[1:50:26] thousands and thousands
[1:50:28] let's just pick up another place for us
[1:50:30] Revelation chapter 19 and verse 6. and I
[1:50:33] heard as it was a great voice of
[1:50:35] multitude a great voice of many Waters a
[1:50:38] voice of Mighty thunderance saying
[1:50:40] hallelujah the Lord God omnipotent
[1:50:43] reigneth
[1:50:46] let us be glad and rejoice
[1:50:49] and give honor to him for the marriage
[1:50:52] of the Lamb has come and his wife has
[1:50:55] made herself ready
[1:50:58] and to her was granted that she should
[1:51:00] be arrayed and find linen clean and
[1:51:02] white for the fine lineness of
[1:51:04] righteousness of the Saints and he saith
[1:51:07] unto me blessed are they which are
[1:51:10] called to the marriage supper of the
[1:51:12] lamb and he said unto them these are the
[1:51:15] true sayings of God
[1:51:21] amen
[1:51:30] leadership brother Branham is getting
[1:51:31] ready to preach his last sermon other
[1:51:33] than communion
[1:51:36] and now he's preached on leadership and
[1:51:38] taken a lot of different thoughts
[1:51:42] on the Holy Ghost leadership for the
[1:51:44] bride in this day
[1:51:45] and he comes down to his final prayer
[1:51:49] and I've always found that the prophet's
[1:51:51] prayer is as powerful as his sermon
[1:51:57] he said our great leader
[1:51:59] of eternal life
[1:52:03] we accept your promise tonight
[1:52:06] father I plead for this people
[1:52:09] I plead for every one of them in the
[1:52:11] name of Jesus Christ
[1:52:13] Lord I pray Christ the son of God will
[1:52:17] come into their hearts
[1:52:19] every one of them
[1:52:21] Lord and mold us and make us into new
[1:52:25] creatures in Christ Jesus
[1:52:28] Grant it Lord God
[1:52:31] we love you
[1:52:32] we want our dispositions our change to
[1:52:36] come into us
[1:52:38] that we can be your children and fill
[1:52:41] the your spirit moving in our hearts
[1:52:45] Lord tendering us bringing us to
[1:52:48] realization of this insane age that
[1:52:52] we're living in granted God
[1:52:55] when we see young women so ought to
[1:52:59] so caught up in the web of the devil
[1:53:01] young men perverted Minds children dope
[1:53:04] addicts cigarette smoking drinking
[1:53:07] immorality
[1:53:10] Satan's Eden
[1:53:14] God had taken 6 000 years according to
[1:53:17] the Bible to build in Eden and you put
[1:53:20] your son and his wife there in his broad
[1:53:24] to rule over it Adam and Eve
[1:53:27] to keep the garden and Satan come around
[1:53:30] and perverted it
[1:53:33] and he's got 6 000 years and he's built
[1:53:37] his own intellectual Eden the one we're
[1:53:40] living in
[1:53:41] through science and education and
[1:53:44] so-called intelligence and he's built it
[1:53:47] into a mass of death
[1:53:52] people don't know what's right what's
[1:53:54] wrong
[1:53:58] they don't know what's reality and
[1:54:00] what's fake
[1:54:03] they don't know what's fiction or what's
[1:54:06] fact
[1:54:10] it's that way in their news
[1:54:15] it's that way and the government's not
[1:54:17] just ours it's that way in the societies
[1:54:21] it's that way in their music it's that
[1:54:24] way in their school systems
[1:54:31] what they're trying to say here even in
[1:54:33] our state of Virginia
[1:54:35] to where parents
[1:54:38] can't take care of their children or
[1:54:40] even call their little boys boys or
[1:54:43] little girls girls
[1:54:45] our state
[1:54:49] we'd have never saw this coming 50 years
[1:54:51] ago
[1:54:53] but look where we're at today
[1:54:55] a whole lot worse than that's going on
[1:55:00] but God's going to take us back to Eden
[1:55:03] again
[1:55:06] he's got a people that's on the Earth
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:12] come on
[1:55:14] come here amen
[1:55:17] that can live in Two Worlds at the same
[1:55:19] time
[1:55:21] that could be the keeper of our Gardens
[1:55:24] of our homes
[1:55:27] God can come and live with us
[1:55:30] I want you to just notice in the Old
[1:55:33] Testament
[1:55:34] I don't want to go too long but in the
[1:55:36] Old Testament it was
[1:55:39] it was God over man
[1:55:42] and if you remember Adam
[1:55:45] what he lost
[1:55:47] was to have the god-likeness
[1:55:50] to be able to speak to the storm and
[1:55:52] call it back or move a mountain or move
[1:55:56] trees by nature or even call The Animals
[1:55:59] by name
[1:56:00] none of them were vicious
[1:56:04] Eden was a place that no leaves ever
[1:56:07] fell to the ground
[1:56:10] but when When sin came into the garden
[1:56:14] he found his wife with a strange seed in
[1:56:18] her womb
[1:56:19] [Music]
[1:56:20] and remember what God told him the day
[1:56:23] that you eat thereof it's the day you
[1:56:26] die
[1:56:29] Adam had a choice
[1:56:33] Adam had a choice right here and I'm
[1:56:35] going to go too deep in it but Adam had
[1:56:37] a choice because he reflected where he
[1:56:41] came from
[1:56:43] he reflected the Messiah and he was an
[1:56:46] amateur God on Earth he knew God
[1:56:49] wouldn't kill him
[1:56:53] so he placed his seed on the inside of
[1:56:56] her
[1:56:58] and then God came down
[1:57:01] why did you sin who told you this
[1:57:10] Adam blamed the woman
[1:57:12] the woman
[1:57:14] blames the serpent
[1:57:18] the serpent was cast to the ground to
[1:57:21] her where he was unidentifiable
[1:57:27] the woman was cursed to where that she
[1:57:30] would have babies
[1:57:31] by natural conception
[1:57:34] and through the womb she would carry the
[1:57:37] seed and that baby that's that's what
[1:57:40] sister Gabrielle is going through
[1:57:42] contractions five minutes apart she's
[1:57:45] watching those contractions she's went
[1:57:47] to the hall to the hospital a couple of
[1:57:49] different times she don't want to miss
[1:57:51] it
[1:57:53] it is not William and her having a baby
[1:57:57] bye
[1:57:59] it's William in the same car
[1:58:02] William in the same hospital room but
[1:58:06] she's having a baby
[1:58:11] because it was part of the natural curse
[1:58:14] upon the woman
[1:58:18] but William has to be the worker
[1:58:22] he has to be the head
[1:58:24] by thorns and thistles and work and
[1:58:27] sweat of the brow
[1:58:30] by the economies you have to work
[1:58:34] but God's going to bring us back to
[1:58:36] Restoration
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:40] [Music]
[1:58:45] now think about this just I just want to
[1:58:48] just think about this Moses was standing
[1:58:51] at a Red Sea
[1:58:55] and God tells him to stretch her on his
[1:58:58] rod
[1:59:00] over that body of water
[1:59:06] it would be almost like what Adam would
[1:59:09] do
[1:59:12] when he would stretch his Rod out
[1:59:14] he would watch God
[1:59:16] opened that body of water
[1:59:21] it wasn't Moses opening it
[1:59:25] but he was taken God in his word
[1:59:29] and God was saved why are you crying to
[1:59:32] me speak
[1:59:35] there was a tribe that had already
[1:59:37] walked out into the water they was not
[1:59:40] going to walk back
[1:59:41] [Applause]
[1:59:43] and they'd already got it to their noses
[1:59:45] they were trusting God there's sometimes
[1:59:48] you've got to trust God
[1:59:50] when there's nothing else to do you've
[1:59:52] got to trust God
[1:59:55] and they walked across go ahead and let
[1:59:58] the critics say they walked across on
[2:00:01] dry reefs
[2:00:04] well let me just say this shoe the same
[2:00:06] critic has to answer that God took those
[2:00:10] dry reefs and drowned the biggest army
[2:00:13] that was in the world
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:27] Daniel because he prayed
[2:00:31] and he fellowship with God
[2:00:34] his enemy told him he couldn't pray no
[2:00:36] more
[2:00:41] and he couldn't worship no more
[2:00:44] so they signed a decree
[2:00:46] that he would have to go to the Lion's
[2:00:49] Den
[2:00:50] lines that were hungry
[2:00:53] and lines that would would destroy a man
[2:00:56] in just a few seconds
[2:00:58] the king even prayed
[2:01:01] that Daniel's God
[2:01:03] would help him to preserve
[2:01:05] but Daniel would say I'll see you in the
[2:01:07] morning
[2:01:14] Daniel walked into this dungeon
[2:01:18] it wasn't Daniel
[2:01:21] that caused those lines to lay down
[2:01:25] and not be hungry
[2:01:27] but it was an angel of the Lord
[2:01:30] God himself in the room
[2:01:34] it was that same God that would have
[2:01:37] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to not
[2:01:39] bend their knees to the to the mighty
[2:01:42] mighty image of Daniel
[2:01:46] but they would be cast into a fiery
[2:01:48] furnace notice all of these
[2:01:52] events are natural events
[2:01:58] Lions Red Sea
[2:02:01] Elijah and Elisha
[2:02:04] Elijah when he comes to the end and he
[2:02:06] had incredible miracles in his life but
[2:02:09] when he comes this time to go home he
[2:02:11] won't go home by Death
[2:02:14] but he'll go home by a chariot
[2:02:17] as a matter of fact brother Adam said he
[2:02:19] would walk across and there would be
[2:02:21] chariots at the bushes and he would go
[2:02:24] over and pick one
[2:02:26] so there's a lot of other chariots that
[2:02:28] are waiting on me and you
[2:02:32] and he'd go over and get in that Chariot
[2:02:34] and Elisha had asked for a double
[2:02:37] portion of the blessing
[2:02:40] he had just smote that Jordan River and
[2:02:43] that Jordan opened up
[2:02:46] and Elisha
[2:02:48] came back to that Jordan and he screamed
[2:02:52] out where is the Lord God of Elijah
[2:02:56] and it opened up again
[2:03:00] Elisha would have all but one Miracle to
[2:03:04] equal the double portion and they buried
[2:03:07] no doubt had an incredible ceremony for
[2:03:09] Elisha as they buried him in the cave
[2:03:13] no doubt the critics said he come up one
[2:03:16] short
[2:03:19] don't you never underestimate our God
[2:03:31] one day there was a battle going on and
[2:03:34] a man died and his friends were carrying
[2:03:36] him they'd carried him as far as they
[2:03:38] could go and he had died and they
[2:03:40] throwed him in that cave
[2:03:45] those Dry Bones lay in there have the
[2:03:49] power of Promise of Resurrection
[2:03:52] let me just say that Resurrection
[2:03:54] power's still alive today
[2:03:57] your body may go back to the ashes and
[2:04:00] the glasses but God made you a promise
[2:04:03] on Resurrection morning I'll raise you
[2:04:06] up out of the ground
[2:04:18] that was under the blood of bulls and
[2:04:20] goats
[2:04:21] but our Messiah come
[2:04:26] he would come to the Earth
[2:04:30] he would leave the ivory palaces of
[2:04:32] Heaven
[2:04:33] take upon the form of a man
[2:04:36] he didn't come like the world was
[2:04:37] looking for he didn't come to their
[2:04:39] schools he didn't come to their thinking
[2:04:42] he come out of a
[2:04:45] a little
[2:04:47] a little nesty place
[2:04:50] Bethlehem
[2:04:53] it would be a barn setting
[2:04:56] because they wouldn't have room for him
[2:04:58] in the end
[2:05:04] Mary would be called a woman of ill
[2:05:06] refute
[2:05:08] many would say because of her testimony
[2:05:10] that it was a supernatural birth they
[2:05:13] would say that she'd had a relationship
[2:05:16] with a Roman soldier
[2:05:18] before Jesus ever arrived Satan was
[2:05:21] putting a bad name on him
[2:05:24] I'd say this to you before you ever came
[2:05:27] to Jesus
[2:05:29] now if you could just think about this
[2:05:31] just for a moment I'm not going to get
[2:05:32] done but if you could just think about
[2:05:33] this for a minute
[2:05:35] you're a predestinated seed
[2:05:42] and you know you're walking in darkness
[2:05:45] but there's something on the inside of
[2:05:47] you that you've never discovered for
[2:05:50] yourself
[2:05:51] oh there might be times of moments to
[2:05:53] words you'd you'd feel a warm presence
[2:05:56] come to you and you knew that you
[2:05:58] couldn't explain that
[2:06:00] and you knew there was a higher calling
[2:06:02] for you
[2:06:03] but in your life you've no doubt made
[2:06:05] some mistakes and had some failures
[2:06:10] and yet something kept holding you
[2:06:14] friends were getting all different kinds
[2:06:16] they would fall apart and this and that
[2:06:17] but something had a hope to your life
[2:06:20] what you see
[2:06:22] was God was making his way in your
[2:06:25] direction
[2:06:26] and if you could see it in a spiritual
[2:06:29] form there was a light that was coming
[2:06:32] to that seat
[2:06:35] and listen the devil watches for that
[2:06:38] light
[2:06:40] and he's watching for it to come so he
[2:06:42] begins to battle you
[2:06:44] and sends you in the wrong directions
[2:06:46] your free moral choice will take you
[2:06:49] away from God
[2:06:52] it wasn't you choose God God chose you
[2:06:56] it was the law of election he elected
[2:06:58] you before the foundation of the world
[2:07:00] that's Grace
[2:07:03] he knew who would come to him
[2:07:07] we talk about the marriage supper of the
[2:07:10] Lamb he knows exactly how many seats to
[2:07:12] have there
[2:07:14] in John 14 he said I go to prepare a
[2:07:17] place for you that where I am
[2:07:21] going to build you a tabernacle that'll
[2:07:24] never age
[2:07:28] it'll never get gray-headed it'll never
[2:07:31] be touched by cancer
[2:07:34] sin will have no issue with it
[2:07:38] oh no pressures with it whatsoever
[2:07:43] listen this isn't a fairy land
[2:07:47] Adam fell
[2:07:49] but God has restored Eden again
[2:07:56] now it was God above them
[2:07:58] then it was God with them
[2:08:03] I don't know what it was like or what
[2:08:06] sensation they would have had
[2:08:08] when Jesus turns
[2:08:10] water to wine
[2:08:16] because that don't happen in a science
[2:08:17] lab
[2:08:29] that never seen that ever done before
[2:08:36] and then the disciples said the people
[2:08:38] are here and they're hungry
[2:08:42] do we have any food
[2:08:45] well we've got a little boy that's come
[2:08:47] skipping school
[2:08:49] that's what brother Braham said
[2:08:52] so we're just taking Betty's word he
[2:08:54] said he come and Skip in school and said
[2:08:55] he's got some Fish and Loaves that means
[2:08:57] he got he's got some fish and loves and
[2:08:59] he said well bring him here
[2:09:01] and Jesus blessed them
[2:09:04] can you imagine what he told his mom and
[2:09:05] dad that night
[2:09:10] I learned things in science and Anatomy
[2:09:13] I never thought I would
[2:09:15] this man
[2:09:16] it's kind of a bearded man Slender Man
[2:09:18] and this man blessed him and then he
[2:09:21] just sat and watched us
[2:09:23] and he would break it off and break it
[2:09:25] off and break it off and I watched him
[2:09:27] when he broke it off it multiplied again
[2:09:28] and watched him broke it off and he
[2:09:30] multiplied again I watched when the fish
[2:09:32] came out it looked like it was empty and
[2:09:33] it multiplied and they fed over five
[2:09:35] thousand
[2:09:39] that don't happen in the science class
[2:09:55] Satan didn't know what he was doing
[2:10:02] when pilate told them to take him and
[2:10:04] beat him
[2:10:06] that it would fulfill Isaiah 53.
[2:10:10] because we would need to be restored to
[2:10:13] Eden
[2:10:15] and these bodies
[2:10:16] that would have certain sales that are
[2:10:19] supposed to be killing us
[2:10:21] God would be able to say now that's far
[2:10:24] enough
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:37] that's far enough
[2:10:39] and as they beat him
[2:10:42] one whipping after another whipping
[2:10:45] even to where that his body would open
[2:10:48] up till his organs would show
[2:10:50] he was beat like no other human band
[2:10:53] but yet had the power to call Ten
[2:10:55] Thousand Angels
[2:10:57] so in his quietness he was greater than
[2:11:01] he was in his words
[2:11:06] Hallelujah somebody shout right there
[2:11:10] in his quietness he was much more
[2:11:14] powerful
[2:11:18] when he was revolved he reviled not
[2:11:20] again
[2:11:22] so he put that inside of you knowing you
[2:11:26] would need it in this layout to see you
[2:11:28] when they revile you
[2:11:30] and you can't hold yourself you just set
[2:11:34] still and your Stillness has more power
[2:11:38] [Applause]
[2:11:51] foreign
[2:11:57] on calvary's Cross
[2:12:01] he said father
[2:12:02] into thy hands
[2:12:04] I commit my spirit
[2:12:08] if Satan would have known what he was
[2:12:10] what was going on here
[2:12:12] he was losing the rights
[2:12:15] to the Garden of Eden
[2:12:19] what he had caused in the fall he was
[2:12:21] losing his rights to hold
[2:12:23] because this man
[2:12:25] would show up in his kingdom
[2:12:29] and he would come through paradise and
[2:12:32] release every one of them from Abraham
[2:12:34] all the way down
[2:12:36] all the prophets couldn't do it
[2:12:38] Moses as great as he was
[2:12:41] he lied as great as he was
[2:12:44] John the Baptist as great as he was was
[2:12:47] not as great as this man Jesus
[2:12:50] listen there's not a name greater than
[2:12:52] Jesus Christ
[2:12:54] and he would go to the paradise of the
[2:12:57] realm and open the doors of paradise and
[2:13:00] set them free
[2:13:02] [Applause]
[2:13:03] he would go down into hell and preach to
[2:13:06] the souls in hell and tell them you had
[2:13:09] Enoch you had all the prophets and you
[2:13:12] wouldn't listen to them and you wouldn't
[2:13:14] listen to me
[2:13:16] then he went to the headquarters of hell
[2:13:19] and knocked on the door of hell
[2:13:22] and Satan came and said I got you
[2:13:28] haha
[2:13:30] he said my blood's still wet on that
[2:13:32] cross I fell
[2:13:34] but I come down here to over I take it
[2:13:37] over take over the keys of death hell in
[2:13:40] the grave
[2:13:41] isn't no wonder Paul could scream oh
[2:13:44] death worship sting oh grave worship
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:14:05] two thousand years we had churches
[2:14:10] but God sent us a prophet in this day
[2:14:15] because the word had to be released to
[2:14:17] us
[2:14:19] to restore us back to Eden again
[2:14:22] that Mark chapter 11 would be fulfilled
[2:14:25] in our lives
[2:14:27] not that we're looking for the Revival
[2:14:29] to come but it's happening now
[2:14:32] not that we're looking for some great
[2:14:34] day for something to take place but it's
[2:14:36] happening right now
[2:14:37] what other atmosphere is taking place
[2:14:40] while Putin is doing what he's doing the
[2:14:43] angel of Destruction is holding his
[2:14:45] hands back
[2:14:47] he would have already dropped a lot of
[2:14:49] atomic bombs if he could he is screaming
[2:14:52] to fulfill his part in the scriptures
[2:14:55] he will don't you worry but it will not
[2:14:58] come one day too soon
[2:15:01] because there is a bride
[2:15:03] [Applause]
[2:15:08] oh Hallelujah
[2:15:15] now you see
[2:15:17] we're playing our part
[2:15:21] he said we can see the marriage suppers
[2:15:23] at hand
[2:15:26] he says if I never see you again
[2:15:29] remember the marriage suppers at hand
[2:15:32] the kingdom according to the promise is
[2:15:34] ready to be issued in
[2:15:36] the great millennium
[2:15:38] and the taking up of the church
[2:15:40] and the destroying of the wicked and the
[2:15:44] world under the Sixth Seal to be
[2:15:45] purified by volcanic to take all the
[2:15:48] corruption the sin of the world and mold
[2:15:50] her out again and bring her bring her
[2:15:54] forth a bright New Millennium for the
[2:15:56] age that is to come
[2:15:58] notice these words you got just a couple
[2:16:01] more minutes
[2:16:02] the world seems to be in the most evil
[2:16:04] age that there ever was never an age
[2:16:06] like did women ever act like that never
[2:16:10] before has there been destruction of the
[2:16:12] and alluvian World Jesus referred to it
[2:16:15] has God lost his control
[2:16:18] or is he just permitting another Angel
[2:16:20] an agency to control
[2:16:22] the true answer to this question to my
[2:16:25] opinion there's two opposing Spirits at
[2:16:29] work
[2:16:30] in the world today at work there can't
[2:16:33] be no more than two two heads one of
[2:16:35] them is the holy spirit at work
[2:16:38] the other is the spirit of this the
[2:16:40] devil and the these last days in
[2:16:42] deception and I'm gonna base my thoughts
[2:16:45] on this for this message the two Spirits
[2:16:47] one of them is God's holy spirit the
[2:16:49] other is the devil Spirit working in
[2:16:51] deception the people of the Earth
[2:16:55] are now making their choice
[2:16:59] I've always thought that was a powerful
[2:17:00] statement
[2:17:02] the people of the Earth are now making
[2:17:05] their choice
[2:17:07] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[2:17:10] bride for Christ
[2:17:12] he's doing it by vindicating his word a
[2:17:15] promise to her for this age
[2:17:18] showing that it is Christ
[2:17:22] so who is it among us in these meetings
[2:17:29] so I come down to this who is it Among
[2:17:32] Us in these meetings
[2:17:34] it's not other than the mighty Angel
[2:17:37] himself
[2:17:40] all over the world he's doing this
[2:17:44] we're not just alone in this
[2:17:46] he's all over the world moving getting
[2:17:49] the bride in position
[2:17:52] she's heard the message
[2:17:54] it's more than a script to her she
[2:17:57] stepped into the Fulfillment of the time
[2:18:01] but the finger is supposed to move in
[2:18:03] this age the finger will move if the
[2:18:06] foot is supposed to move in this age the
[2:18:08] foot will move if the eye is supposed to
[2:18:10] see in this age the eye will see the
[2:18:13] spirit of God as it grows into a full
[2:18:15] stature of God and it is the age that
[2:18:18] we're living now the holy spirit is here
[2:18:22] vindicating I love this part vindicating
[2:18:25] the message of the Allah
[2:18:29] as we watch the other day as brother
[2:18:31] Timothy was standing here
[2:18:35] and his iPad begins to do what it did
[2:18:38] when we listened to brother Andrew
[2:18:40] preach and God just comes and then we
[2:18:43] begin to Worship the Lord and it's wave
[2:18:46] after wave after wave that's not some
[2:18:49] rock and roll
[2:18:51] [Applause]
[2:18:53] are you with me I'm thankful for music
[2:18:55] but it's way more than music it's a wave
[2:18:59] of the Holy Spirit of a people that want
[2:19:01] to worship God
[2:19:06] oh
[2:19:09] my
[2:19:13] the devil with his holy with his Unholy
[2:19:15] spirit
[2:19:16] is here calling his church by error
[2:19:22] by perversion
[2:19:23] of the word of God
[2:19:26] like he did
[2:19:27] back at the beginning
[2:19:30] so it's repeating Eden again for both
[2:19:34] spirits
[2:19:36] amen
[2:19:38] Satan going back to the Garden of Eden
[2:19:41] and taken just one word out of your
[2:19:44] Bible
[2:19:45] and all it takes is one word to curse
[2:19:48] you
[2:19:50] but God takes the word and restores it
[2:19:53] and puts you back into position again
[2:19:55] and then you become a keeper
[2:20:00] and then you fellowship with the angel
[2:20:02] of God in your home you feel that warm
[2:20:04] presence come in your home
[2:20:10] and you just know that's him
[2:20:13] that ain't the devil wanting you to pray
[2:20:17] then all of a sudden you're standing in
[2:20:19] the kitchen and you're worshiping the
[2:20:20] Lord and you're going whoo
[2:20:23] what a presence here
[2:20:26] you've you've created a home
[2:20:29] to where God wants to come and be with
[2:20:31] you
[2:20:34] can I I'll leave you with this
[2:20:40] one night I woke up and
[2:20:42] I recognized he was in the room
[2:20:49] and I just stood up it was about four it
[2:20:51] was 404 in the morning
[2:20:56] and I just stood up
[2:20:59] we heard we heard the testimony sister
[2:21:01] Julie with the hands on that hand on her
[2:21:04] shoulder
[2:21:05] I knew what she was talking about
[2:21:08] and I was standing there
[2:21:11] and I was standing facing away from the
[2:21:13] bed
[2:21:14] and if you ever had anybody kind of just
[2:21:16] turn you
[2:21:18] they just kind of turn you
[2:21:22] and it was like a father
[2:21:25] just turned me
[2:21:28] and he was standing behind me
[2:21:31] and then he began you heard us preach it
[2:21:33] now
[2:21:35] Ron
[2:21:38] I want you to see past what you see
[2:21:48] buried
[2:21:52] and he said I want you to think past
[2:21:56] what you think
[2:22:00] why did I need that
[2:22:03] when you're faced with a death sentence
[2:22:05] you can't look at this flesh
[2:22:17] when you're faced with issues of life
[2:22:20] and many of you are
[2:22:27] brother Jerry me and you stood under oak
[2:22:29] tree
[2:22:30] and he just came down
[2:22:39] then you came in a prayer line
[2:22:44] and it was told to you the angel stands
[2:22:47] at your property
[2:22:49] under a certain tree
[2:22:51] and watches over your property
[2:22:56] you've probably never seen that angel
[2:22:58] but God made it known to you that he's
[2:23:01] there
[2:23:03] and then you too wanted to get married
[2:23:06] under that tree
[2:23:13] and now God's taken that property and
[2:23:16] doing some very special things with it
[2:23:19] you tell me
[2:23:21] he's not among us
[2:23:25] amen
[2:23:28] oh do you love me
[2:23:34] so we're brother Ron it's not for our
[2:23:36] our carnal life
[2:23:39] you mind if I tell you one more story
[2:23:46] amen we were working
[2:23:50] at a customer or partner
[2:23:53] and I'm never told this here
[2:23:56] and Matthew looked over at me and said
[2:23:58] Dad what's wrong
[2:24:00] and I said I'll tell you later
[2:24:04] and he asked me he said what's wrong Dad
[2:24:05] I said I'll tell you later
[2:24:09] we go to lunch
[2:24:12] and I said I'll tell you now
[2:24:14] I had a visit
[2:24:16] with the angel of the Lord while we were
[2:24:18] working
[2:24:19] and they told me what's going on at that
[2:24:21] company
[2:24:24] and I need to talk to the owner
[2:24:28] so Andrew said well I need to go
[2:24:30] somewhere else will you go and
[2:24:32] will you go see him
[2:24:36] so I I went to see him and they were
[2:24:38] sitting on some pipe about this tall
[2:24:40] they were sitting there he was sitting
[2:24:42] with a welder
[2:24:47] and he said Ron we've lost about five
[2:24:49] hundred thousand dollars in the last
[2:24:50] month
[2:24:51] and he said we're going bankrupt by the
[2:24:53] day
[2:24:55] and I said I'll tell you something if
[2:24:58] you if you'll trust me
[2:25:00] I just got a visit about an hour ago
[2:25:03] they told me exactly what's going on in
[2:25:05] your company
[2:25:07] I don't know your books I don't know
[2:25:08] your situation
[2:25:10] but I know three people that are
[2:25:12] stealing from you
[2:25:15] and one of them is your general manager
[2:25:17] and two is your other managers and you
[2:25:19] got to get rid of them you got to get
[2:25:21] rid of them right away
[2:25:23] within them within six weeks
[2:25:28] within six weeks they were totally
[2:25:31] restored
[2:25:32] Hallelujah
[2:25:35] and that welder was there he said I'll
[2:25:37] tell you that's God if I've ever seen
[2:25:40] God that's God
[2:25:53] we don't do this to try to make money
[2:25:55] with
[2:25:56] but God sent this message for us
[2:26:00] that we can live an overcoming life
[2:26:03] [Applause]
[2:26:04] why are you with me now
[2:26:07] we can live an overcoming life that a

[2:49:07] [Music]
[2:49:15] we went through tonight

[2:49:26] is in you
[2:49:28] foreign
[2:49:30] was just telling stories
[2:49:33] he took a simple scripture
[2:49:36] year of God little children and greater
[2:49:39] is he that is in you than he that is in
[2:49:41] the world
[2:49:42] and he went through testimony after
[2:49:44] testimony
[2:49:46] choral story
[2:49:48] little Georgie Carter
[2:49:50] Colorado Mountain
[2:49:52] he went through those things it was more
[2:49:54] than stories that was going on
[2:49:57] some of you sat there and you thought
[2:49:58] what's the year in review like what is
[2:50:00] it what is what is this going on
[2:50:02] we've told it from this side can you
[2:50:05] imagine Hale's year in review
[2:50:07] [Music]
[2:50:10] I lost this one I lost that one
[2:50:13] I lost that battle I thought I had him
[2:50:15] with suicide I thought I had him with
[2:50:17] depression I thought let's go back
[2:50:19] through Satan's reader and review I lost
[2:50:21] Ron Spencer I lost Erica Parker I lost I
[2:50:25] lost this when I thought I had him bound
[2:50:27] to alcohol but I lost them
[2:50:32] I say he that is in you that is is
[2:50:34] greater than he that is in the world
[2:50:37] and then he took us the things that are
[2:50:40] to be
[2:50:42] you're going to be there
[2:50:45] you're going to be there you're going to
[2:50:46] walk down these Shores you're going to
[2:50:48] walk down these gold and pave ways
[2:50:50] you're going to walk down through those
[2:50:51] things
[2:50:53] I'm one of those things that are to be
[2:50:55] there
[2:50:56] because we have accepted a perfect Eden
[2:51:01] the Bible said in Isaiah 26 and 3 I will
[2:51:04] keep him in perfect peace whose mind
[2:51:08] is stayed on thee
[2:51:10] to think that you can live in laodicea
[2:51:13] and live in perfect peace
