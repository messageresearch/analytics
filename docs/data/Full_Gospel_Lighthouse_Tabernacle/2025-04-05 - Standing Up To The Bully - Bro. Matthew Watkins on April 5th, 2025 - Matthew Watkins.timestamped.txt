[31:34] grandfather that was an incredible
[31:36] message believer and uh he was in
[31:38] brother Brandham's meetings and and I
[31:41] when I was a boy preacher I I preached
[31:44] to him and then brother Jason has has
[31:47] been a buddy for many many years and you
[31:50] guys were with him brother Doug and
[31:51] Sister Chassity and uh brother Matt has
[31:55] raised up under all of that. Listen this
[31:58] message works. Yes, this message works.
[32:03] And if you want your children to be
[32:05] successful, keep them under this
[32:07] message.
[32:09] And it so works. And I'm so thankful for
[32:11] that tonight. And I just want to share
[32:14] my week if I can do that for you. Uh it
[32:17] was about five years ago that uh we
[32:20] started a journey and uh it was at
[32:23] brother Danny Stevens that I had my
[32:25] first seizure and uh then I would I
[32:28] would have a vision of climbing down in
[32:31] a very deep horrible pit. And at the
[32:34] bottom of that pit I would find Sister
[32:37] Melissa and I would ask her, "Are you is
[32:40] it time to walk out?" I didn't know what
[32:42] kind of pit that I would be in. And in
[32:45] the coming weeks, I I would I would get
[32:47] signs that what we were going to go
[32:49] through with brother Kelly, brother Tim
[32:51] Puit, and then I was going to go to
[32:53] brother uh Ed Biscos. I won't be but a
[32:56] minute. But and we went on a journey. I
[32:59] I would I thought we had a prostate
[33:02] infection and we went to the doctors and
[33:05] and we found out we didn't have that.
[33:09] And uh we had cancer and cancer would be
[33:12] in the lungs and in the lymph nodes and
[33:14] then then in my brain. Three tumors.
[33:17] Never forget the night that that a
[33:19] rookie a rookie doctor walks in and and
[33:22] just drops the news on us. Do you know
[33:24] that you you've have three tumors on the
[33:27] brain and that was a horrible
[33:31] night. We begin to take chemo, different
[33:34] kinds of chemo. And we have taken chemo
[33:37] and we'll take it for quite a while. But
[33:40] this week, as I told you, we were going
[33:42] to have a brain scan at 6:00 on I think
[33:45] it was Monday or Tuesday morning. And u
[33:48] Sister Connie, remember, she sang with
[33:49] us last week. And hey, listen, I ought
[33:52] to have her to sing more often.
[33:56] If it works like that, I want to have
[33:58] her to sing.
[34:00] Yeah.
[34:08] And so we went at six o'clock in the
[34:10] morning and we we had our brain scan. We
[34:12] came back to uh Stewart's draft and had
[34:15] another doctor's appointment. Then she
[34:17] drove me back for a 3:00 appointment at
[34:19] UVA and we put some miles on cars. And
[34:22] so and so anyway, we went into Dr. Dr.
[34:26] Fidoul. I don't know if I'm okay to say
[34:27] that publicly, but I'm going to. He's
[34:30] probably not going to see it. No way.
[34:33] And uh we we sat in his office. We
[34:35] actually sat in his office quite a
[34:37] while. Waited on him, but it was worth
[34:38] the wait. We sat in his office and he
[34:41] walks in. Now, keep this in mind. I've
[34:43] had over 20 brain scans and showing
[34:47] tumors and showing growth and showing
[34:49] this kind of things and uh showing a lot
[34:52] of things. I've had two I've had two
[34:53] brain surgeries. And so, and so he walks
[34:56] in and he walks in and said, "It's a
[34:59] miracle."
[35:02] Amen. Well, I thought you'd have a
[35:04] better reaction than that.
[35:08] He walks in and said, "It's a miracle."
[35:13] And he said, "I've studied your test.
[35:15] I've looked over thoroughly twice." And
[35:18] he said, "We'll have the rad doctor
[35:20] radiologist to look over it." He found
[35:22] some little things, but but he said,
[35:25] "This is your first clean brain scan.
[35:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:04] Hallelujah.
[36:06] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[36:14] Five years ago, they gave me no hope.
[36:17] That's right. Come on. Five years ago,
[36:19] the doctor sat down on my bed and and
[36:23] she placed her hand in my hand and and
[36:26] she said, "You know, you have about four
[36:28] weeks, four months to live."
[36:32] And she sent me on a journey that she
[36:34] said, "I want you to get everything in
[36:35] order." And I did. everything that I
[36:39] know. I got my finances in order. I got
[36:41] I got all different kind of documents in
[36:43] order. I did exactly what they said.
[36:46] When they told me to take chemo, I did
[36:48] exactly. Brother Brandham said, "You go
[36:50] to the doctor, take his medicine."
[36:52] But I believe that we've got another
[36:54] power.
[36:57] We got another power.
[37:08] And they've warned me of ups and downs
[37:09] even at this point, but I want you to
[37:11] know if God got me this far,
[37:15] I don't mind running riding a roller
[37:18] coaster. Let's ride together. And so we
[37:21] thank you for
[37:24] that. Thank you so much for
[37:28] that. Amen.
[37:34] Now, just before brother Matt comes and
[37:36] I want Andrew to sing for us,
[37:41] but we'll see the lung team this week
[37:44] and the torso team and then in a week or
[37:47] so we'll see the kidney
[37:49] team. But God is the God that knows how
[37:51] to take care of a brain.
[37:54] And I want to give all you hope that is
[37:57] fighting cancer out there on the
[37:59] internet. Right.
[38:02] God can do this.
[38:05] When it looks so horrible, God will take
[38:08] your case.
[38:11] He'll take your case. And and he's been
[38:14] with me for five years. And I want to
[38:16] thank him for it. I just want to thank
[38:19] him and give him the thanks for it. And
[38:22] uh you pray for us as as we continue our
[38:25] journey. And uh it's not over yet. It's
[38:28] a long journey in front of us. They
[38:30] warned me. It's a long journey in front
[38:31] of me. You'll have to take chemo for
[38:34] quite a while. You'll have to go through
[38:35] these tests for years. But I said,
[38:37] "Lord, if you got me this far,
[38:42] if you got me this far,
[38:45] I knew when Sister Melissa came back to
[38:47] the Lord that we walked out of that pit
[38:50] together.
[38:52] Sister Melissa, I believe I can see the
[38:54] sun now.
[39:05] To God be the glory. To God be the
[39:09] glory for what he has
[39:15] done. Amen. Amen. I'm looking forward to
[39:19] hearing brother Matt. I've heard him so
[39:21] many times
[39:24] uh by internet and by meetings, but this
[39:29] will be my first time in public to hear
[39:32] him. And you know, I was sick all
[39:34] morning and vomiting all morning.
[39:37] And I Brother Tam and Brother Donnie
[39:40] said, "You going to church?" I said,
[39:41] "Yep. I want to hear him in person."
[39:45] Amen. If the devil's fought me this hard
[39:48] to not be here tonight, that means that
[39:51] Matt Watkins has got something for me to
[39:55] hear.
[40:13] Glory. the children of Israel when
[40:15] they'd go through their journey and they
[40:17] were making their way through the land,
[40:18] they would stop after a victory and
[40:20] they'd build themselves a an altar and
[40:22] they'd worship. This is a moment where
[40:24] you can lift up a shout and a praise to
[40:26] Almighty God.
[40:29] Hallelujah. This is no small
[40:33] thing.
[40:35] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[40:38] Lord. Let's have a seiz.

[40:56] of God. I want you to get what you came
[40:59] for and get more than what you came for.

[41:10] thinking it in your heart while we get
[41:12] ready to sing this song that I know that
[41:14] my redeemer lives. I want you to ask big
[41:16] things. I want you to ask God something
[41:19] very specific tonight that God will
[41:22] answer answer the very questions of your
[41:25] heart. Do you believe that he's able?
[41:27] Amen. Oh, who taught the
[41:31] son where to stand in the
[41:38] morning? And who told the
[41:42] ocean you can only come this
[41:50] far?
[41:51] And

[45:46] offering if you believe that he lives?
[45:48] Hallelujah.
[45:50] [Applause]
[46:05] Amen. Are you glad you serve a living
[46:07] savior? Amen. He's proved himself alive
[46:10] today. We heard a testimony about it
[46:12] today. He is the same yesterday, today,
[46:15] and he'll be the same forever. Amen. You
[46:18] can count on that kind of a God. Amen.
[46:20] We ought to give the Lord another hand
[46:22] clap of praise. He's worthy of all of
[46:24] our praise. Yes,
[46:27] Lord. Thank you,
[46:29] Jesus. Thank you,
[46:33] Lord.
[46:35] Amen. Amen. Give him praise for the
[46:38] things that he's done and the things
[46:40] that he's going to do. Amen. We can
[46:42] count on that. If God did it yesterday,
[46:44] he'll do it today. If he did it today,
[46:46] he'll do it tomorrow. Amen. He'll take
[46:49] us all the way. I'm so glad to serve
[46:51] that kind of a of a God. Amen. He is the
[46:54] same today. God bless you. Amen. It's
[46:57] just a uh an honor, such an honor to be
[46:59] here with you and a privilege to be
[47:01] standing here and I just count it such
[47:03] an honor. I really mean that. I I really
[47:06] think that I'm the least uh among
[47:08] anybody who could stand here. But I'm
[47:11] I'm just so grateful, amen, to to to be
[47:13] here with you, and I trust that the Lord
[47:15] will be able to use me this weekend.
[47:17] Amen. That's all I've prayed leading up
[47:19] to these services. Lord, just if you
[47:21] could use anything, use me this weekend,
[47:23] Lord. Amen. Speak through me. Amen. I
[47:26] appreciate Brother Ron. His uh I could
[47:28] just preach a whole hour on how much I
[47:30] appreciate Brother Ron. Amen. His
[47:32] ministry over the years since I was just
[47:35] a little boy. Uh hearing him there in
[47:37] Ruth, North Carolina, and uh told him
[47:39] had to confess today that I slept
[47:41] underneath the pew sometime on him on
[47:43] the sawdust there. But I was a little
[47:45] young, brother. I think I had a good
[47:46] excuse. But but uh his ministry has just
[47:49] meant so much to me and and I know the
[47:51] bride around the world feels that way.
[47:54] Amen. He's a walking, talking, breathing
[47:56] miracle. Amen. And every day that he
[47:58] gets up, he's a miracle. Amen. and and I
[48:01] believe his faith, you know, that's that
[48:03] sometimes it'll God will take somebody
[48:05] through something and then let them
[48:07] stand to that test and it will be the
[48:10] catalyst so that you could reach out and
[48:12] grab a hold of what you need in your
[48:14] life to say if God did it for him, Lord,
[48:17] then you're the same God today in my
[48:19] life. Amen. Why did Hatty Wright ask for
[48:21] her children? So that I could ask for
[48:23] mine.
[48:25] Why did God save hers? So, because God's
[48:27] going to save mine. And so, everything
[48:30] God did in the past, he does today. We
[48:32] believe that with all of our heart.
[48:34] Amen. I appreciate Brother Andrew so
[48:36] much. He's such a dear friend, him and
[48:37] Sister Katie. And that we got to be
[48:39] there and preach with him in in Belgium.
[48:42] And uh I'm still trying to figure out
[48:44] what he takes before every service he
[48:45] preaches to get that kind of energy. I
[48:48] thought is a five hour, two five-hour
[48:50] energies. I don't know what it is, man.
[48:52] I could tell you. And if and if he I
[48:53] really want to know what Brother Matt
[48:54] McClard's taking. My
[48:58] goodness. I think he I think he's got a
[49:00] little charge of the hol they got a
[49:02] charge of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Like
[49:04] brother Brandham said, when the devil
[49:05] had met Moses, he had met, you know, uh
[49:08] he had met uh you know, Isaiah, but he
[49:10] said when he touched Jesus, it sends the
[49:12] hairs off of his wings. He got a hold of
[49:15] a live wire. He was a He got a hold of
[49:17] something. Amen. So, we just love these
[49:19] brothers so much and I just count it
[49:22] such an honor. I bring greetings from my
[49:23] dad, my mom there in Buford, South
[49:26] Carolina. And and God bless you, Brother
[49:28] Doug, Sister Chassity. Good to see them.
[49:30] Amen. Good friends of ours from there.
[49:32] And we bring greetings from there. And
[49:34] and just uh Amen. He wanted me to send
[49:36] my greetings. And so we just love the
[49:38] Lord with all of our heart. Amen. If you
[49:40] don't know me, I'm Brother Matt Watkins
[49:42] and I'm nobody, but uh but I know
[49:44] somebody. Amen. And I and I just uh just
[49:48] want to say again how much how much of
[49:50] an honor it is to be here. Thank you for
[49:52] all the music. Amen. If you have your
[49:54] Bible, we'll turn to the book of Daniel,
[49:55] chapter 3. I'm sorry. First, we'll
[49:58] before we go to Daniel 3, we'll turn to
[49:59] 2 Samuel chapter 23.
[50:22] Amen. 2 Samuel chapter 23 and verse
[50:32] 8. I'm going to start this timer that I
[50:34] have. Our church at home loves this
[50:36] timer, Brother Ron. And I tell them
[50:38] every time I'm going to start it to keep
[50:40] to one hour. And uh I tell them though,
[50:43] I don't tell you when it goes off. You
[50:45] don't know that. I keep it on silent.
[50:47] And I think some people started setting
[50:48] it with me and they know when it goes
[50:50] off. But I tell them if I'm still
[50:52] preaching, I ain't done and it goes off.
[50:53] Well, we stepped into eternity now.
[50:58] Amen. But I I just u want to say what
[51:00] the Lord wants me to say. I want to
[51:02] preach to you tonight and uh I'm going
[51:05] to title this standing up to the bully.
[51:09] standing up to the bully. You believe
[51:12] the devil's a bully?
[51:15] Amen. He's a bully and he's relentless.
[51:18] He never lets up. Amen. But we've got a
[51:20] word to stand up against him today.
[51:22] Amen. Let's look here in 2 Samuel
[51:24] chapter 23 and verse 8. These be the
[51:26] names of the mighty men whom David had,
[51:30] the Tacmanite that sat in the seat,
[51:32] chief among the captains. The same was
[51:34] Adino the Esnite. He lifted up his spear
[51:38] against 800 whom he slew at one time.
[51:43] Now, I want just to take for a moment
[51:45] here and not take too much time to lay a
[51:48] foundation for this, but you'll notice
[51:50] when you study the army of David that he
[51:52] would have an entire army full of
[51:54] soldiers. But then in that great group
[51:58] of soldiers, in that great remnant, we
[52:00] could say that inside of that, there was
[52:03] a selected, elected, anointed 33 men
[52:08] that he had. And these were known as the
[52:11] mighty men, right? And so he begins to
[52:14] name them. But then even in that top 30,
[52:18] uh there was the top three.
[52:22] And so you see here that there's
[52:23] categories. It's not about fair or
[52:25] unfair. But then there was a great
[52:27] group, an outer group. But then within
[52:30] that there was a selected group of men
[52:33] who were mighty men. And then there was
[52:35] three who were known as the three
[52:38] mightiest men that David had. Let's look
[52:42] at verse 9. And after him was Elizer,
[52:45] the son of Dodo, the ahite. You could be
[52:48] a son of a dodo, brother Ron, and still
[52:50] be a mighty man.
[52:55] Praise the
[52:57] Lord. Notice this here. One of the three
[53:02] mighty men with David. When they defied
[53:04] the Philistines that were there gathered
[53:06] together to battle, and the men of
[53:08] Israel were going away, he arose and
[53:10] smoked the Philistines until his hand
[53:13] was weary and his hand clave unto the
[53:16] sword. And the Lord wrought a great
[53:18] victory that day, and the people
[53:20] returned after him only to spoil. Verse
[53:22] 11. And after him was Shyama, the son of
[53:25] a gee the Herite. And the Philistines
[53:28] were gathered together into a troop. I
[53:31] love this. Where there was a piece of
[53:33] ground full of lentils, and the people
[53:37] fled from the Philistines. Notice this.
[53:40] But he stood.
[53:44] Sometimes the victory begins when you
[53:48] just stand.
[53:50] He stood in the midst or the middle of
[53:53] the ground and defended it and slew the
[53:56] Philistines and the Lord wrought a great
[53:59] victory. Let's turn over to book the
[54:02] book of uh of Acts chapter 2 and then
[54:05] I'll have you be seated. Amen. Acts
[54:07] chapter 2. Very familiar scripture to us
[54:10] all and I just want to read just a
[54:11] portion of it here. Acts chapter 2.
[54:24] Verse 12 says, "And they were all amazed
[54:27] and were in doubt, saying one to
[54:28] another, what meanest this?" Others
[54:31] mocking said, "These men are full of new
[54:33] wine." But Peter, notice, standing up
[54:37] with the 11. I wish I could preach a
[54:39] sermon to you tonight on standing up
[54:41] because you realize how many times in
[54:43] the Bible God commands this. Stand up.
[54:46] Get up. Arise.
[54:49] And he says here, the Bible says that
[54:50] Peter standing up. Notice this here with
[54:53] the 11 lifted up his voice. I know a lot
[54:57] of people don't like preachers who shout
[54:58] and scream. Well, you wouldn't have
[54:59] liked Peter too much. The Bible says he
[55:02] lifted up his voice and said unto them,
[55:05] "You men of Judea and all that dwell at
[55:07] Jerusalem, be this known unto you and
[55:10] hearken to my words. These are not
[55:12] drunken as you suppose, seeing it as but
[55:14] the third hour of the day. But this is
[55:16] that which was spoken by Joel by the
[55:19] prophet Joel. And it shall come to pass
[55:21] in the last days, sayaeth God. I will
[55:23] pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and
[55:25] your sons and your daughters shall
[55:27] prophesy, and your young men shall see
[55:28] visions, and your old men shall dream
[55:31] dreams, and on my servants, and on my
[55:34] handmaidaidens. I will pour out in those
[55:36] days my spirit and they shall prophesy.
[55:41] Lord Jesus, we just bow our heads now.
[55:44] So thankful, Lord, that you've called
[55:47] us. So thankful, Lord, for your grace in
[55:50] our own life. How we could testify,
[55:52] Lord, of it. And look back down the road
[55:54] of our life. There's only one thing we
[55:57] can say of how we find oursselfves here
[56:00] on a Saturday night in church, Lord,
[56:02] with a hunger and a thirst for your
[56:05] word. There's only one thing that
[56:07] explains that, and that's your grace, oh
[56:10] God. We could have been anywhere else
[56:12] today, Lord, but we stand here tonight
[56:14] wanting more with our hands lifted up to
[56:17] say, Lord, I want more. I've received,
[56:19] Lord, but I ask for more tonight. I pray
[56:22] that you'd come and be the refreshment
[56:24] that someone's looking for. Be the
[56:26] encouragement in your word, Lord, that
[56:28] someone needs. I pray, oh God, that you
[56:30] would take my words, Lord, as I stand
[56:32] now here in great need of you,
[56:34] expecting, Lord God, to you for you to
[56:37] take complete control. I pray, God, that
[56:39] you would take the words that you've
[56:41] ordained me to speak, Lord, and may they
[56:43] be a weapon, Lord, to tear the devil's
[56:46] kingdom down. May they be an arrow of
[56:48] deliverance for someone who needs it
[56:50] tonight, oh God. May they pierce a
[56:53] sunder and divide both soul and spirit,
[56:55] both body and spirit, and contact the
[56:57] very soul of somebody today. Grant it,
[57:00] Lord Jesus, we pray in Jesus Christ's
[57:02] name. Amen. Amen. You can be
[57:05] seated. Brothers, if you have the
[57:08] slides, you can go ahead and display
[57:09] them and have that just ready for me if
[57:11] you could just advance with me. Got some
[57:13] just some quotes. I'd like to read some
[57:14] things. It's amazing when you think
[57:17] about this man Shaman and the Bible says
[57:20] that he stood in the midst of the
[57:22] ground, a ground full of lentils. You'll
[57:24] see this example all throughout the
[57:26] Bible of men who had to stand all by
[57:29] themselves when nobody else was there.
[57:32] When nobody nobody was there to
[57:34] encourage them, when nobody was there to
[57:36] pray for them. Yet they had to, like
[57:38] David, find something and draw from the
[57:41] well that God had put inside of them and
[57:44] encourage themsel in the Lord. The Bible
[57:47] tells us this, that Satan over and over,
[57:50] you could think of the examples of how
[57:52] that the devil is a bully. I'm preaching
[57:54] to you tonight on standing up to the
[57:56] bully. Think of how many examples I
[57:58] could think of of the devil being a
[58:01] bully. You know, it's amazing because
[58:03] Brother Barham tells a story about uh
[58:05] Peter Cartwright. You know that story
[58:07] really well and how that he stood up to
[58:09] a bully that came to try to shut down
[58:11] his meetings and up there washing
[58:13] windows and and washing some glass. And
[58:15] here comes Peter. Here comes that bully
[58:17] into town with the pistol on his side
[58:19] and said, "If you're going to hold your
[58:20] meetings, you're going to have to get
[58:22] through me." And and and brother
[58:24] Brandham, you know, is not making this
[58:25] story up. I actually went and looked it
[58:27] up. You could find it right on brother
[58:29] Google tell you history records this
[58:31] story of Peter Cartwright and how that
[58:34] the history says that Peter didn't have
[58:36] a conversation he didn't try to reason
[58:38] with him he didn't try to be a diplomat
[58:40] you know sometimes like we do with the
[58:42] devil and we try to make deals with him
[58:44] and and you know and and negotiate and
[58:46] negotiate about negotiations and but but
[58:49] Peter Cartwright history says just says
[58:51] all right got down off the ladder and
[58:52] says buddy that's the next thing that
[58:54] I'll do then and and history records
[58:56] that He whipped that bully. And then the
[58:59] next night, I think that that weekend of
[59:01] meetings, there was a few eight or nine
[59:02] men that came in the meetings trying to
[59:04] stir things up. And and and here it was
[59:06] again, Peter Cartrite again whipping
[59:08] some bullies and led those men to the
[59:10] Lord. Jesus got saved in those meetings.
[59:12] Friends, I think sometimes we ought to
[59:14] stand up to the bully in our life and
[59:16] don't try to talk to him. Don't try to
[59:19] negotiate with him. Just say, "Devil, if
[59:21] you want to come at me, the next thing
[59:23] that I'll do is I'll take the word of
[59:25] God, the sword of the spirit of God, and
[59:27] I will cut your head off. You come
[59:29] against my family, come against my
[59:31] children, come against my church. I'm
[59:33] not here to make negotiations or to be a
[59:36] diplomat. I'm here to give you the word
[59:38] of God." And the word on the mouth of a
[59:41] believer, the prophet of God said, "The
[59:43] word on the mouth of a believing
[59:45] Christian is the same as deity speaking.
[59:48] It has never failed in the mouth of a
[59:50] believing son or daughter of God.
[59:53] I think of men like this. It was Shama
[59:56] who would stand in the field full of
[59:57] lentils. You know, as a preacher, you
[59:59] try everything to pull out all the
[1:00:01] meaning of a word. And I tried
[1:00:04] everything to pull out the meaning of
[1:00:05] lentils. And I got to be honest, there
[1:00:07] ain't nothing there. It's just
[1:00:09] lentils. It was a full a field full of
[1:00:13] lentils. But the Bible says the
[1:00:16] significance is is that everybody around
[1:00:18] him ran.
[1:00:21] These were not heathens. These were
[1:00:23] children of Israel. These were sons of
[1:00:25] D. These were sons of God. These were
[1:00:27] the army of David. And the Bible says
[1:00:29] that they all ran for their life. But
[1:00:31] the scripture says that he stood. Let's
[1:00:34] pick it up here. He stood in the midst
[1:00:36] of the field and defended it.
[1:00:41] You know, I think it's so powerful
[1:00:42] sometimes when you got to stand all by
[1:00:45] yourself and there ain't nobody there.
[1:00:47] Shamba didn't have nobody to go on. He
[1:00:49] didn't have no nothing to go on. He's
[1:00:51] much like Shamgar when Shamgar had
[1:00:53] nobody to help him. Didn't have no
[1:00:55] resources. You know what Shamgar had? He
[1:00:58] had a losing record.
[1:01:02] And he here comes the enemy to take
[1:01:04] everything that he had year after year
[1:01:06] after year. The Bible says that here was
[1:01:08] Shamgar and he says year after year the
[1:01:10] Philistines would come and try to
[1:01:12] plunder what he had, take the food off
[1:01:14] of his shelves, take it from his family,
[1:01:17] take it from his children. You hear
[1:01:18] brother Brandham dramatize it there. And
[1:01:20] he says there was Shamgar, his little
[1:01:22] wife, you know, and and just skin to the
[1:01:24] just skin and bones. And he says, you
[1:01:27] know, there and and and and just year
[1:01:29] after year had plundered him. I mean,
[1:01:31] year after year, he had lost to the
[1:01:33] devil. the same exact enemy time and
[1:01:35] time and time again had beaten Shamgar
[1:01:38] and and and had taken everything that he
[1:01:40] owned. You know what's so powerful
[1:01:42] though? When you go read that that story
[1:01:44] of Shamgar, I'm going to give you
[1:01:45] something so so means so much to me. The
[1:01:48] Bible says that one day, do you know the
[1:01:52] power of one day?
[1:01:55] Do you know the power of one day? In
[1:01:58] other words, it didn't matter to Shamgar
[1:02:00] how many times he had lost before. this
[1:02:03] day was going to be different because he
[1:02:06] knew that God was not the God of
[1:02:08] yesterday, but that God is the God of
[1:02:10] one day, today, right now. Doesn't
[1:02:13] matter how many times I lost. Doesn't
[1:02:15] matter how many times I've been a
[1:02:17] failure. God is the God of today. His
[1:02:20] mercy is new. Today, today is the day of
[1:02:23] salvation. It's the power of one day.
[1:02:26] Shamgar said, you know what Shamgar said
[1:02:28] after he heard those Philistines? You
[1:02:31] imagine if we announce him, here's
[1:02:32] Shamgar. Here's the devil. 600 demon.
[1:02:36] These were soldiers, trained armies, a
[1:02:39] trained army coming marching down the
[1:02:41] road. Shamgar didn't have no weapons. He
[1:02:43] had no Tomahawk missile. He had no
[1:02:45] Blackhawk helicopter. He had no Raptors.
[1:02:48] He had no F-18s. He had nothing to fight
[1:02:50] these men. He He had nothing. You know
[1:02:52] what he had? He had the memory of how
[1:02:55] many times the devil had beat him at
[1:02:57] this before.
[1:02:59] Imagine announcing here's the devil.
[1:03:01] What is he? He's 30 and0. Here's
[1:03:03] Shamgar. His record is 0 and 30.
[1:03:09] He has lost and he lost again and he
[1:03:12] lost again and he lost again. But God
[1:03:14] was going to do something different that
[1:03:15] day. You know, you say, "Brother Matt,
[1:03:18] what changed between all the times he
[1:03:20] had lost and today?" I'll tell you what
[1:03:22] changed. Shamgar got suddenly a
[1:03:24] revelation that said, "You know what?
[1:03:26] Those are my children. This is my farm.
[1:03:30] This is not the devil's body. This is my
[1:03:33] body. And my body's a temple of the Holy
[1:03:35] Ghost. This is my family. That is my
[1:03:38] church. And the devil can't have them.
[1:03:40] You got to look at the devil in the eye
[1:03:42] and say, "Satan, those are my children.
[1:03:45] That is my body. This is my family. That
[1:03:48] is not your home. This is my
[1:03:51] house." Hallelujah.
[1:03:54] And you got to say, "It doesn't matter
[1:03:56] how many times I fought you yesterday
[1:03:57] and lost, Satan. Today is going to be
[1:04:00] different. Today is going to be
[1:04:01] different, Satan. They might have lost a
[1:04:03] hundred times, but today God's going to
[1:04:06] get a victory.
[1:04:10] He stood up against the bully in his own
[1:04:13] life. You can think of example after
[1:04:15] example of this of bullies that come
[1:04:17] against and you know, I think of
[1:04:19] Nebuchadnezzar and you can look at it in
[1:04:21] Daniel chapter 3. Let's look at it
[1:04:23] together. Maybe we'll do that just as we
[1:04:25] as we go along here. Daniel chapter 3.
[1:04:28] Let's look at this together. Very
[1:04:29] familiar to you. But I just want to uh
[1:04:32] just read it. Maybe you could just keep
[1:04:34] that up, brother. We could just read it
[1:04:35] here. It's totally fine. I want you to
[1:04:37] notice this here. Very familiar to you.
[1:04:39] Here was Nebuchadnezzar. And the Bible
[1:04:42] says that he's going to have this great
[1:04:43] feast and he's going to invite all of
[1:04:46] the all of the important people, the
[1:04:48] sheriff and the mayor and all of the
[1:04:50] governors and everybody's going to be
[1:04:52] there and he's going to have this great
[1:04:54] image that he erects for everybody to
[1:04:56] stand up, everybody to bow down to.
[1:04:58] Notice it here in verse four of Daniel
[1:05:00] chapter 3. And then a herald cried aloud
[1:05:02] said to you it is commanded oh people
[1:05:04] nations and languages that at what time
[1:05:07] you hear the sound of the cornet the
[1:05:09] flute the harp the sack the sultry
[1:05:11] doulamer all of this music and you fall
[1:05:13] down and worship the golden image that
[1:05:15] Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. Notice
[1:05:18] verse six. And who soleth not down
[1:05:21] notice who so fallth not down and
[1:05:24] worshipeth shall that same hour be cast
[1:05:27] into the midst of a burning fiery
[1:05:29] furnace. Ain't that just like a bully?
[1:05:33] He uses words and he uses intimidation.
[1:05:37] I want to just take here just for a
[1:05:39] moment and show you that words are so
[1:05:41] powerful. Thoughts are a powerful thing.
[1:05:44] That's where it begins. But the the the
[1:05:46] the the words that are spoken have the
[1:05:49] power to change the atmosphere.
[1:05:53] You know, the word spoken, not thought
[1:05:55] of, not pondered upon. That's wonderful.
[1:05:58] But the word spoken, the Bible says,
[1:06:01] "Let the redeemed say so." And so there
[1:06:04] was a power even when we look at in in
[1:06:06] in Revelations chapter nine and it talks
[1:06:08] about how that the power was in his
[1:06:11] tongue. And and and the the Bible says
[1:06:14] that that the dra the great dragon uh
[1:06:17] with his tail he drew a third part of
[1:06:20] the sons of God. You remember that in
[1:06:22] Revelations chapter nine. And the Bible
[1:06:24] says that he threw a third he drew a
[1:06:26] third part of the stars of God. And it
[1:06:28] was it was the dragon's tail. But a
[1:06:30] prophet through prophetic insight said,
[1:06:32] "Notice it was not his tail t a i l, but
[1:06:37] it was his tail t a l e. It was what he
[1:06:41] spoke.
[1:06:43] You see, it was what the devil don't
[1:06:45] listen friends, the devil don't hate
[1:06:46] preaching. He's got a lot of preachers
[1:06:49] himself.
[1:06:52] He hates what's being
[1:06:53] preached. Amen. You see, it's the power
[1:06:57] of the spoken word. And with his tail,
[1:07:00] he with he drew a third part of the sons
[1:07:02] of God, which the brother Brandham tells
[1:07:04] us was the sons of Abraham who crucified
[1:07:07] Jesus. The angels were given free moral
[1:07:10] agency to believe the lie of the devil
[1:07:13] and they believe it and they became
[1:07:15] demons. That's what a demon is. It's a
[1:07:17] fallen angel. And they believe the tale
[1:07:20] or the sermon that Lucifer was speaking.
[1:07:24] And so the devil, notice this here, the
[1:07:26] devil is not, we think of some ghoulish,
[1:07:28] gobbish creature, but the devil is very
[1:07:31] religious. Brother Brandham said Cain
[1:07:33] was more religious than Abel was, right?
[1:07:36] And he says that he that that that there
[1:07:38] was what the devil spoke. It was the
[1:07:40] what he pro a false prophet will
[1:07:42] prophesy people into a tribulation.
[1:07:44] That's what a prophet said that a false
[1:07:47] prophet prophesies. It was a prophecy,
[1:07:49] something that he spoke with his mouth.
[1:07:52] And this was just like Nebuchadnezzar
[1:07:54] when he was speaking these words, who so
[1:07:57] fallth not down, in other words,
[1:07:58] intimidation. It's what the devil loves
[1:08:00] to do. He loves to get create fear. An
[1:08:03] atmosphere of fear will never breed
[1:08:06] faith. Fear breeds fear.
[1:08:10] That's why it's important the things
[1:08:11] that you feed upon, the people that you
[1:08:14] hang out with, the friends and
[1:08:15] associates that you have because those
[1:08:18] words feed you with something and they
[1:08:20] will either produce faith or they'll
[1:08:22] produce doubt. That's why brother
[1:08:24] Brandon made it very simple. There's
[1:08:25] only two influences you can be
[1:08:26] influenced by the devil or God. There's
[1:08:28] only two. And so those words begin to
[1:08:32] feed them with something and begin to
[1:08:34] create something, an anointing of using
[1:08:37] human faith to believe that lie and be
[1:08:40] damned by it. And so it would be a
[1:08:42] faith, a word that was spoken by
[1:08:44] Nebuchadnezzar. Whoever doesn't bow down
[1:08:47] shall that same hour be cast into the
[1:08:50] midst. Oh, it was very fearful. A an
[1:08:53] atmosphere of of fear using images of
[1:08:57] fear. Listen friends, I'm going to
[1:08:58] preach here because I feel the Holy
[1:08:59] Spirit is telling me, you know,
[1:09:01] sometimes he says go, other times he
[1:09:02] says break just for a moment here. I
[1:09:05] think it's so amazing because so many
[1:09:07] times we don't realize how much the
[1:09:10] things that we subject oursel to, I'm
[1:09:12] talking very natural things, influence
[1:09:15] our life and our atmospheres that we
[1:09:17] live in. We've had youth camp here at
[1:09:19] our in our church for a few years now
[1:09:22] and I've the Lord would give me grace
[1:09:25] last year and I spoke to my goodness I
[1:09:27] forget how many you youth camps that
[1:09:30] there were that we spoke to and just
[1:09:32] youth speaking to young people and
[1:09:33] prayer lines and you know it would come
[1:09:35] over and over and over and over again to
[1:09:37] the young people that battling
[1:09:39] depression, battling anxiety, battling
[1:09:41] fear, battling all these kind of things.
[1:09:43] I thought, my goodness, this is like
[1:09:44] it's like the dominating spirit of our
[1:09:47] age is a is is this anxiety and this
[1:09:50] pressure
[1:09:52] that we're constantly under and and and
[1:09:55] and thoughts of suicide and thoughts of,
[1:09:58] you know, uh self harm and cutting
[1:10:00] themselves at thought. My it's like it's
[1:10:02] like it's the the central demon or the
[1:10:05] spirit of our age to attack our young
[1:10:07] people. And I'm I'm just going to go
[1:10:09] ahead and say it. It's now moved beyond
[1:10:11] young people because it isn't only young
[1:10:14] people. Sometimes we criticize so much
[1:10:16] being addicted to, you know, social
[1:10:18] media and entertainment and YouTube. I
[1:10:20] think it's bled on past the young people
[1:10:23] and now we got full-grown adults and
[1:10:25] people that spend their time and spend
[1:10:27] their time. And I'm not I'm not
[1:10:29] preaching against anything here. I'm
[1:10:31] just I'm just here to say that we ought
[1:10:33] to be careful the things that we feed
[1:10:35] upon. I think it's time that we go back
[1:10:37] and check on the thing. Did you ever
[1:10:39] think that it's a it's not a mistake? If
[1:10:41] you ever look at Facebook or I'm just
[1:10:43] going to show my age here because I
[1:10:45] don't know some of the new things my
[1:10:47] kids pick on me all the time. And uh you
[1:10:49] know Facebook and Instagram and Tik Tok
[1:10:51] and and and and I'm just going to stop
[1:10:53] there because that's the only ones that
[1:10:54] I know. But they they feed you
[1:10:57] something. They're giving you something.
[1:10:59] You ever notice they're called a feed,
[1:11:00] brother Andrew? Cuz they're feeding you
[1:11:03] something.
[1:11:05] And people don't realize the very thing
[1:11:07] I want free of my anxiety. I want free
[1:11:09] of my fear. I want free of my
[1:11:10] depression. Sometimes I got to ask the
[1:11:12] question, do you realize the very thing
[1:11:14] that you want freedom from sometimes is
[1:11:17] the very thing that you are ingesting
[1:11:23] because you ingest those spirits. Many
[1:11:25] people died from COVID and and that's a
[1:11:27] terrible thing and a sorrowful thing.
[1:11:29] But a lot more people that never got
[1:11:31] COVID got the fear and ingested the
[1:11:33] spirit of fear that COVID came with. And
[1:11:36] it's done more damage to their spirit
[1:11:39] than he ever did to their body.
[1:11:43] Because that's the climate that we live
[1:11:44] in. It's an age of fear, of constant
[1:11:47] pressure, constant anxiety. You know
[1:11:49] what's so amazing though, Brother Ron?
[1:11:51] I've always noticed, never one time have
[1:11:53] I ever listened to a tape of God's
[1:11:56] prophet and when it was done, I felt
[1:11:58] fearful.
[1:11:59] Never one time have I listened to God's
[1:12:01] prophet and ever felt anxiety. I've
[1:12:04] never turned it off and felt I'm so
[1:12:05] nervous. I've never felt depressed. I've
[1:12:08] never felt worried.
[1:12:09] [Applause]
[1:12:11] I think it's time we shut the door to a
[1:12:14] dimension of demons and open a door to a
[1:12:17] dimension from
[1:12:19] heaven and let God send ministering
[1:12:22] spirits to encourage you.
[1:12:27] If there was ever a time for you to hear
[1:12:29] the voice of vindication of the seventh
[1:12:31] angel messenger, brother, it's right
[1:12:34] now. Right now, you ought to be playing
[1:12:36] tapes. Right now, you ought to be
[1:12:38] reading your Bible. right now. If there
[1:12:40] was ever a time we should be in in
[1:12:42] communion with the Holy Spirit, it's
[1:12:44] right now.
[1:12:48] That was free. I don't I don't know
[1:12:49] where I'm at, but I'm somewhere.
[1:12:53] And so amazing because we don't realize
[1:12:55] that the words of this this is the bully
[1:12:57] that we face. He uses, as David said,
[1:13:00] he's a whisperer. He whispers, as David
[1:13:02] said in Psalms 13, in my ear, he
[1:13:05] whispers his his sayings and the hiss of
[1:13:08] his tongue of my enemies. What's he
[1:13:10] trying to do? He's trying to anoint you
[1:13:12] with that fear.
[1:13:14] And you get so fearful and he backs you
[1:13:17] down into a corner. Sort of like Gideon
[1:13:19] was back down into a corner. You notice
[1:13:21] Hiden knew that he was a son of Abraham,
[1:13:23] but he was just hiding there. And if the
[1:13:26] devil can do anything, he'll get us so
[1:13:28] intimidated by things. Listen friends,
[1:13:30] he will put fearful thoughts in your
[1:13:32] mind. I've realized a long time ago, the
[1:13:34] devil will never take me to hell because
[1:13:37] God already went there. I was identified
[1:13:39] with him and his death, his burial, and
[1:13:41] his resurrection. And I could never go
[1:13:43] to hell no more than God can go to hell.
[1:13:46] But he will try to make my life on earth
[1:13:48] a living hell
[1:13:52] by affecting me with fear and anxiety
[1:13:55] and worry. Listen, sometimes the devil
[1:13:58] will create thoughts in your mind and
[1:13:59] you will end up he'll he'll put thoughts
[1:14:02] in your mind of things that will never
[1:14:04] happen.
[1:14:06] They'll never happen. But if he can get
[1:14:10] you to start to think and dwell on those
[1:14:12] things, you'll start to live in the
[1:14:14] reality of something that will never
[1:14:16] take place in your life. It'll tell you
[1:14:18] about what's going to happen to your
[1:14:20] children. It going to tell you what's
[1:14:21] going to happen to your family. Going to
[1:14:22] tell you what's happening to your
[1:14:23] health. You get a little, you know,
[1:14:24] little pain in your body and your next
[1:14:26] thing you know, you're googling it and
[1:14:27] before you know it, you've self-
[1:14:29] diagnosed yourself with every kind of,
[1:14:31] you know, diseases that haven't even
[1:14:33] been uh named yet.
[1:14:37] And what does it mean when I have acid
[1:14:39] reflux and a stomach bug and my right
[1:14:41] ear hurts and then my left shoulder
[1:14:42] moves?
[1:14:44] And I guarantee you, type that in,
[1:14:46] Google will give you a a disease that
[1:14:48] you probably
[1:14:50] have. And the devil will try to project
[1:14:53] an image of a life that you were never
[1:14:57] called to live.
[1:15:01] He'll try to false prophesy over your
[1:15:03] life, but it's a false prophecy. He'll
[1:15:05] try to tell you he'll you'll lose your
[1:15:07] children. They're never going to come
[1:15:08] back. You lose your home. They're never
[1:15:10] going to come back. You're going to lose
[1:15:11] your health. You're he'll put all kinds
[1:15:13] of things and paralyze you. And you will
[1:15:17] live I've seen people living in the
[1:15:18] reality of something that will never
[1:15:21] take place in their life.
[1:15:29] And so he he gets this fear factor upon
[1:15:31] them. Oh, if you don't bow down, you
[1:15:34] shall that very same hour be cast in the
[1:15:36] midst of a burning fiery furnace. And
[1:15:38] then notice the intimidation here. I
[1:15:40] love this. And and he says here, he
[1:15:42] says, "Who so followth not down shall be
[1:15:44] cast. Therefore, at that time when all
[1:15:45] the people heard the sound, here was the
[1:15:47] music. Here was the atmosphere. Here was
[1:15:49] the rhythm and everybody's coming. Here
[1:15:51] comes that moment. and all of the music
[1:15:53] when they heard the sound of the beat
[1:15:55] and the cornet and the flute and the
[1:15:57] harp and all this. The Bible says that
[1:15:58] when they heard that they fell down and
[1:16:01] worshiped that image. But he says, "Yet
[1:16:03] therefore there were certain Chaldans
[1:16:05] came near and accused the Jews. They
[1:16:07] spake and said to King Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:16:09] oh king, live forever. Thou, oh king,
[1:16:11] made a decree that at what time you hear
[1:16:13] the sound of the music that you shall
[1:16:14] fall down and worship." And verse 11
[1:16:16] says, "And whoever doesn't fall down,
[1:16:18] uh, shall that same hour be cast into
[1:16:20] the midst of a burning fiery furnace,
[1:16:22] and there are certain Jews whom thou has
[1:16:25] set over the affairs of the province of
[1:16:27] Babylon, Shadrach, Meak, and Abedneo.
[1:16:31] These men, oh king, God not regarded
[1:16:34] thee. They serve not thy gods, nor
[1:16:36] worship the golden image that thouast
[1:16:38] set up." Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage
[1:16:41] and fury commanded to bring these men,
[1:16:44] Shadrach and Abedneo, Meshach, and they
[1:16:46] brought them to the king. Notice what
[1:16:48] happens. Everybody's going a certain
[1:16:50] way. Everybody bows down, but these
[1:16:53] three boys are standing up, sticking up
[1:16:55] like a sore thumb.
[1:16:58] You know why? Cuz they were different by
[1:17:00] design.
[1:17:02] Let me say, you are not them. And God
[1:17:06] made it that way. I said, "You are not
[1:17:10] them. We are not them."
[1:17:14] And I'm not picking on anybody. I'm not
[1:17:16] making anybody any less. I'm just here
[1:17:18] to tell you that by the grace of God,
[1:17:20] you are not of them. So don't try to be
[1:17:22] like them. We shouldn't preach like
[1:17:24] them. We shouldn't sing like them. We
[1:17:26] shouldn't look like them. We shouldn't
[1:17:28] dress like
[1:17:29] them. We ought to be different cuz God's
[1:17:33] family is different by design.
[1:17:36] Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] We speak a different language than they
[1:17:40] speak.
[1:17:45] And notice here they're sticking up like
[1:17:47] a sore thumb, not bowing. And then he
[1:17:50] accuses the he accuses them. Oh, there's
[1:17:52] certain men here. So he's angry. He
[1:17:54] brings them forward. The Bible says
[1:17:56] Nebuchadnezzar raged fury brought them
[1:17:58] forward. He spoke unto them. Notice here
[1:18:00] in verse 14 and said, is it true? Is
[1:18:03] like really guys? Really, you're gonna
[1:18:07] stick out like a sore thumb. You just
[1:18:09] don't want to go with the flow. Come on.
[1:18:13] What's so important about that? I'm
[1:18:15] going to tell you what's important. Go
[1:18:16] ahead, brother. Advance to the next
[1:18:18] slide. I'm going to give you something
[1:18:18] John Wesley said. He said, "What one
[1:18:21] generation
[1:18:22] tolerates, the next
[1:18:25] generation will embrace."
[1:18:29] You see, that ground full of lentils
[1:18:31] might have looked like just lentils.
[1:18:32] What's the big deal, Shama? Just give an
[1:18:35] inch. Come on. Just give an inch. You
[1:18:37] got enough? God's done enough for you.
[1:18:39] Come on. Is it really important? Come
[1:18:41] on. Don't Can't we sort of, Brother M,
[1:18:43] can't we sort of dumb down the message
[1:18:45] just a little bit? Make it a little bit
[1:18:47] more palpable for people. Do we got to
[1:18:49] be so extreme on some of these things?
[1:18:51] Come on. Just give an inch.
[1:18:54] Come on, Shama. Come on. Just Just give
[1:18:56] up the field full of lentils. Let me
[1:18:58] just say this to you. Small defeats will
[1:19:02] always lead to large disasters.
[1:19:08] Small defeats. When you give up the
[1:19:10] smallest inch to the devil, the smallest
[1:19:14] thing in your life, and we abandon some
[1:19:18] of those things that used to be so
[1:19:19] important to us,
[1:19:22] the devil will always infest and he will
[1:19:25] always infiltrate the things that we
[1:19:29] abandon.
[1:19:33] He will always fill up those little
[1:19:35] areas, the little foxes as the Bible
[1:19:37] says that spoil the vine as to the
[1:19:39] devil's playhouse. He will take those
[1:19:42] little inches that you give him and
[1:19:45] little victories will always lead to big
[1:19:49] disasters. It might look like nothing to
[1:19:52] nobody else. And what's the big deal?
[1:19:54] Sha, come on. Just give a little inch.
[1:19:56] Everybody else is running. Just give
[1:19:58] them. We got the rest of the land.
[1:20:00] What's a what's the big deal if one
[1:20:02] person get you know come come on can't
[1:20:04] we just give the devil an inch here?
[1:20:06] Can't we just allow the devil? I know.
[1:20:08] Look, we got all of the church. Why go
[1:20:10] after that one who's struggling?
[1:20:14] Why go after that one? Come on. Don't we
[1:20:16] have enough? It hasn't God Come on. It's
[1:20:18] It's too big, too hard of a battle.
[1:20:22] Do we really got to stand for it like
[1:20:24] that? I mean, God's done enough. But to
[1:20:26] Shama, he knew that this one little
[1:20:28] thing, just one, just like small defeats
[1:20:31] lead to massive disasters, small
[1:20:34] victories lead to Goliath's slain on the
[1:20:37] ground. Little victories in David's
[1:20:40] life. Though nobody was watching and
[1:20:42] nobody was looking out there in the
[1:20:43] field when he slayed the lion, there was
[1:20:45] nobody to give him a, you know, to a pep
[1:20:47] talk. There was no preacher to try to,
[1:20:49] you know, try to encourage him. But the
[1:20:51] Bible says that when nobody else was
[1:20:53] watching and nobody else was there in a
[1:20:55] little field, there was a shepherd boy
[1:20:57] who slayed the lion and he slayed the
[1:21:00] bear. And David when he come before
[1:21:02] Goliath, he looked back at the little
[1:21:04] stones. He looked back at the little
[1:21:07] stepping stones. It would be those
[1:21:09] victories in private that would lead to
[1:21:12] a public victory called the slaying of
[1:21:14] Goliath. And brother, let me tell you,
[1:21:16] don't you ever despise the day of small
[1:21:18] things. I'm talking about the little
[1:21:20] moments when you take a stand for the
[1:21:22] word of God and say, "I'm not going to
[1:21:24] compromise. I'm not going to give in to
[1:21:26] the devil. I'm going to stay on my
[1:21:28] knees. I'm going to stay in my prayer
[1:21:30] closet. I'm going to stay worshiping the
[1:21:32] Lord in spite of what the what it looks
[1:21:34] like in my circumstance.
[1:21:38] Little victories, private victories lead
[1:21:41] to public success."
[1:21:46] Notice here at what time he says and is
[1:21:49] it true? Is it true? Really guys, in
[1:21:52] other words, do you not serve my gods?
[1:21:57] Worship verse 14. The golden image. Now,
[1:22:00] if you be ready, go ahead, boys. Play it
[1:22:03] again. These guys just made an honest
[1:22:07] mistake. Go ahead. if you be ready.
[1:22:10] Shamosh, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo.
[1:22:13] Come on, boys. Play the music again.
[1:22:14] These guys just made an honest mistake.
[1:22:17] I know they didn't mean to. They're
[1:22:18] going to bow this time. He says, "If you
[1:22:20] be ready, and you hear the sound of the
[1:22:22] flute, the harp, all of this." He says,
[1:22:24] "But, but but if you worship not, you
[1:22:28] shall be cast down that same hour into
[1:22:31] the midst of a burning fiery furnace."
[1:22:33] And then he says, "And who who is that
[1:22:36] God?
[1:22:39] that shall deliver you out of my hand.
[1:22:43] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo answered
[1:22:46] and said to the king, "Oh
[1:22:47] Nebuchadnezzar," I love this. We are not
[1:22:50] careful to answer thee in this matter.
[1:22:53] In other words, let me give you my
[1:22:54] generation what they would say. Talk to
[1:22:56] the hand, devil, cuz you ain't worth my
[1:22:59] time. You ain't worth my attention. You
[1:23:02] don't deserve an
[1:23:04] answer. I ain't here to talk to you,
[1:23:06] Satan. You ain't worth any of my energy.
[1:23:09] You ain't worth my attention. I'm a
[1:23:11] believer. I'm a son of Abraham. And it
[1:23:13] doesn't matter what you come against me
[1:23:15] with.
[1:23:18] Hallelujah.
[1:23:20] We're not careful to answer that. You
[1:23:21] ought to tell that to the devil
[1:23:22] sometimes. Satan, you ain't worth the
[1:23:24] time a day for me to negotiate and talk
[1:23:27] to you about this. The God whom I serve
[1:23:30] is able to deliver me out of the hands
[1:23:32] of the fiery burning fiery furnace.
[1:23:36] Notice verse 17. If so be our God whom
[1:23:40] we serve is able to deliver us from the
[1:23:43] burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:23:45] deliver us out of thy hand. Oh king. I
[1:23:48] love a lot of people can have verse 17
[1:23:50] faith. That's easy. But can you go on
[1:23:52] further to verse 18? Can you live in
[1:23:55] verse 18? You see God, the God of the
[1:23:57] impossible only shows up when you meet
[1:24:00] verse 18 kind of faith.
[1:24:02] Verse 18 verse 17 said God's able. Our
[1:24:06] God whom we serve can. But verse 18,
[1:24:08] notice it says, "But if not,
[1:24:17] hold on. Do you know what you're saying,
[1:24:20] Shadrach? But if if if not, that means
[1:24:25] if you
[1:24:26] burn, that means if you go." And he
[1:24:29] doesn't. But if not, I want to show you
[1:24:33] the kind of resolve of a mighty man of
[1:24:36] God. You see, to a mighty man of God,
[1:24:39] it's not about the results of the
[1:24:41] prayer. To a mighty man of God, it's not
[1:24:43] about the substantive things that happen
[1:24:45] or don't happen. To a man of God, it's
[1:24:48] about the principle. It's about the
[1:24:50] standard of the word of God. Shadrach,
[1:24:52] Meach said, "I want to let you know,
[1:24:54] devil, the God whom I'm served is able.
[1:24:56] But I want you to also know, hear my
[1:24:58] voice, that even if he doesn't, I still
[1:25:01] won't bow to your image. I still won't
[1:25:04] bow down. I still won't compromise. It
[1:25:06] doesn't matter if God doesn't save, that
[1:25:09] don't mean he's not a savior. It doesn't
[1:25:10] mean it doesn't matter if God don't
[1:25:12] deliver. That changes nothing. My God
[1:25:15] whom I'm served is a healer whether he
[1:25:18] heals or not. He's a savior whether he
[1:25:20] saves or not. Oh, can you preach with me
[1:25:22] tonight? a a church, the God whom we
[1:25:25] serve.
[1:25:31] It was that kind of faith that produced
[1:25:32] the fourth man.
[1:25:36] Can I go a little further? You see, it's
[1:25:39] that kind of faith that's so missing in
[1:25:40] the generation that we have today. It's
[1:25:43] that kind of faith, that kind of
[1:25:46] attitude of real men, mighty men of God
[1:25:50] who stand for a principle. As brother
[1:25:53] Mandam says, stood for a principle.
[1:25:55] Where's our John Quincy Adams? He said,
[1:25:58] men of principle, men of courage, men
[1:26:01] who take a stand in spite of what
[1:26:03] happens, in spite of what it will cost
[1:26:06] them, in spite of their
[1:26:08] reputation. Men who stand. Oh, men who
[1:26:12] it doesn't matter to them what it costs
[1:26:14] them. Men who will take a stand. As John
[1:26:18] Wesley said, what we live in in the age,
[1:26:19] the age of
[1:26:20] tolerance. And if we ever needed men to
[1:26:23] stand, if we ever needed the real
[1:26:26] identity of true sons manifested sons of
[1:26:29] God, I believe it's right now, church,
[1:26:32] we live in a generation where a man
[1:26:34] don't know what a man is. Doesn't know
[1:26:36] what a can't define what a woman is.
[1:26:38] Come on. It's in our schools. It's in
[1:26:41] our politics. It's in our education
[1:26:43] systems.
[1:26:46] It's an anointing that's came upon this
[1:26:48] age. Oh, well, we've got Trump in the
[1:26:51] office. Thank God for that. But let me
[1:26:52] just tell you, friends, don't be fooled.
[1:26:54] Don't fall into the deception of this
[1:26:56] world. The in Revelations 13, the same
[1:26:58] America who spoke like a lamb one day
[1:27:01] will speak like a a dragon.
[1:27:06] It's in I men don't know what a man is.
[1:27:09] Don't know how to take a stand. Don't
[1:27:11] know how to stand for anything.
[1:27:12] Everybody's so careful about stepping or
[1:27:14] hurting somebody's feelings or saying
[1:27:16] the wrong thing. And you got to
[1:27:17] correctly say it. And you know, we got
[1:27:18] to we got to be careful, brother Matt,
[1:27:20] how we how we say things. We got to be
[1:27:22] careful, you know, how we uh illustrate
[1:27:24] things because we sort of live in that
[1:27:25] age, you know, and everybody's so
[1:27:27] walking around eggshells like walking
[1:27:29] around everybody's feelings. And you
[1:27:31] know what the problem with that is? You
[1:27:33] know what the problem is when you don't
[1:27:34] speak the truth is that the truth is the
[1:27:37] only thing that will set someone free.
[1:27:43] I said the truth spoken the way it was
[1:27:46] written.
[1:27:49] I'm going to stop right there. I just go
[1:27:51] ahead and say it. We don't need to
[1:27:53] doctor up this message. We don't need to
[1:27:55] try to modernize this message. We don't
[1:27:58] need to try to make it more appealable
[1:28:00] to somebody. I say we ought to say it
[1:28:02] the way a prophet said it and let the
[1:28:06] truth break the chains of the
[1:28:09] enemy. We are so careful. This is how
[1:28:12] the devil wants us. So careful how we
[1:28:15] say it. So careful, you know, they don't
[1:28:17] know what a man is. Don't know what a
[1:28:18] woman is. Live with people that, you
[1:28:20] know, I'll tell you what, you say,
[1:28:22] "Well, that's a, you know, that's just
[1:28:23] because of, you know, the the the, you
[1:28:25] know, the woke agenda." I'm going to
[1:28:26] tell you what, friends. You can call it
[1:28:27] what you want. I'll tell you what I
[1:28:29] believe. I believe in the fifth vision
[1:28:30] that brother Brandham of the seven
[1:28:32] visions he had seen the transgender
[1:28:34] movement. He seen the movement of men
[1:28:37] not knowing what a man is and a woman
[1:28:38] not knowing what a woman is. He said I
[1:28:40] prophesied and I seen that a woman took
[1:28:42] the man's place to vote
[1:28:46] and he he pointed to to I love Lucy and
[1:28:49] said it was the dumbing down of the man.
[1:28:53] Nothing. He said what's wrong with I
[1:28:54] love Lucy? What's wrong with you know
[1:28:56] brother Matt seems so harmless? you
[1:28:57] know, seems so, you know, so innocent.
[1:28:59] Yeah. Yeah. Well, the problem is is that
[1:29:01] a prophet is like a watchman on a wall.
[1:29:04] You know what the watchman's job was to
[1:29:05] do? The watchman's job was not to stand
[1:29:08] on the wall and look down when an enemy
[1:29:10] was putting ladders on the wall and say,
[1:29:12] "Hey, boys, we got a problem."
[1:29:16] That wasn't the watchman's job. Anybody
[1:29:18] could do that. Anybody could identify
[1:29:21] the enemy that's invading the church.
[1:29:23] But it took a watchman
[1:29:27] who could look and see far off way
[1:29:31] before the enemy was there and he could
[1:29:34] identify not the fruit but he could
[1:29:36] identify the seed.
[1:29:42] Now you see why brother Brandon preached
[1:29:43] against things like staying home on a
[1:29:45] Wednesday night to watch I Love Lucy
[1:29:48] because he was a watchman who was
[1:29:50] anybody could look at a fruit and say if
[1:29:51] I gave you an orange here's an orange
[1:29:53] here's an apple but if I gave you the
[1:29:54] seeds of those could you identify what
[1:29:56] they are. So I'm so thankful today that
[1:29:58] we had a watchman who was on the wall
[1:30:01] who identified the enemy long before he
[1:30:04] ever showed up on our walls. He
[1:30:06] identified the enemy and said, "I
[1:30:08] prophesy to you in the name of the Lord,
[1:30:10] the world will go completely insane."
[1:30:17] It's an age of neurotics, an age of
[1:30:19] neurosis
[1:30:20] to where men have lost their minds.
[1:30:23] They've lost what it means to be a man,
[1:30:25] lost what it means to be a woman.
[1:30:27] Everybody's out of their place and
[1:30:29] everybody's so afraid to hurt each
[1:30:31] other's feelings. I got a good friend
[1:30:33] back home, Brother Travis, and he came
[1:30:34] up with a statement. I used it. I'll use
[1:30:36] it here again tonight. He said, "F, let
[1:30:39] me tell you what I believe. Feelings are
[1:30:41] overrated."
[1:30:46] Go ahead, write that down. It's
[1:30:48] powerful. Feelings are overrated. Put
[1:30:51] that on a t-shirt and wear
[1:30:54] it. Because we gotten so careful about
[1:30:58] how we dance around feelings,
[1:31:01] how we say it. But do you know that when
[1:31:03] you water the word down, it dilutes it
[1:31:06] and you lose the effect.
[1:31:09] You lose the effect that it can have.
[1:31:12] You abort its effect. If you hybrid it,
[1:31:16] you abort its effect. If you water it
[1:31:18] down, you abort its effect. I think I
[1:31:20] just want to say it this way. Preach it
[1:31:22] the way God spoke it and it will bring
[1:31:25] the results that he promised it would
[1:31:28] bring. Say it the way he said it. Oh, I
[1:31:32] believe it's time we have men and women
[1:31:34] of God who say, "Preach it to me,
[1:31:36] preacher. Preach it the same way God
[1:31:38] spoke it.
[1:31:41] Don't dance around my feelings. Don't
[1:31:43] try to walk around it. Just tell me the
[1:31:45] way that it is, brother. Speak it the
[1:31:47] way that the Bible wrote it.
[1:31:54] But the devil gets us into such a
[1:31:57] tolerance. He's a bully
[1:32:01] gets into such a tolerance to where we
[1:32:03] tolerate things and we tolerate things
[1:32:05] and then what starts off, you know, so
[1:32:08] small then eventually invades and gets
[1:32:10] larger and it gets larger and it gets
[1:32:12] larger. Oh, but I could hear the words
[1:32:14] of a prophet. I love this so much. He
[1:32:16] says be he says, "Dear God, I pray." And
[1:32:19] he says, "Oh," he says, "Uh, oh, wait,
[1:32:22] let me just find my place here." He
[1:32:23] says, "Oh, God, that's like the pull
[1:32:25] pit. Where is
[1:32:27] man?" Man, that's man that stands for a
[1:32:32] principle.
[1:32:35] Where's women that stands for a
[1:32:37] principle? Where's a church that stands
[1:32:40] for a principle? Principle principle. He
[1:32:42] says, "I ain't got a nickels worth of
[1:32:44] time for a wishy-washy give in
[1:32:47] compromising spirit. A woman is a woman,
[1:32:50] let her be a lady. If a man is a man,
[1:32:52] let him be a man. If he's a president,
[1:32:56] where's our John Quincy Adams? Where's
[1:32:58] our Abraham Lincoln's men of principle?
[1:33:01] Where's our Patrick Henry that said,
[1:33:02] "Give me liberty or give me death."
[1:33:06] Where's a man that stands for what's
[1:33:07] right? Where's a man that's not afraid
[1:33:09] to speak out
[1:33:14] regardless? The whole world's against
[1:33:16] him. speak out for what's right and
[1:33:19] stand for it and die for it. Where's our
[1:33:24] Arnold von Winker? He says again today,
[1:33:26] where is men of integrity? Whereas men
[1:33:28] with a spirit, they're so wishy-washy,
[1:33:31] gummed up until they don't know where
[1:33:34] they stand.
[1:33:37] There was ever an identity of this age,
[1:33:40] it's that quote right there.
[1:33:43] But can I tell you about men who stood
[1:33:46] No matter what it cost
[1:33:48] them, I think of what it how important
[1:33:51] it was for the Bible says that Peter
[1:33:54] stood up.
[1:33:56] He stood up. I'm going to tell you
[1:33:57] something. We've you think of Acts two
[1:33:59] and sometimes if you're not careful, you
[1:34:01] you create an imaginary scene that's not
[1:34:03] real. It wasn't. Acts two is not about a
[1:34:06] massive group of people and the whole
[1:34:08] crowds are just cheering and chanting
[1:34:10] and everybody's just happy. Listen, the
[1:34:12] Bible says that Acts two, Peter's sermon
[1:34:14] was in the face of mockers and scoffers.
[1:34:19] That's right. And critics.
[1:34:22] I tell you what, a true move of God will
[1:34:24] always produce two people. It'll always
[1:34:26] produce those who come under the effects
[1:34:28] of that revival. And it will also
[1:34:30] produce critics of that revival.
[1:34:34] A real move of God will always produce
[1:34:36] murmuring and complaining and critics.
[1:34:38] And they said, "Oh, who are these
[1:34:39] people?" you know, full of new wine.
[1:34:41] They're it's they're just drunk on new
[1:34:43] wine. Listen, you know what the Bible
[1:34:45] says that
[1:34:46] Peter stood up with the 11. Oh, I I
[1:34:51] start I was studying this message and
[1:34:53] this sermon and I just wrote it in my
[1:34:55] notes. I said, I I hope this don't sound
[1:34:57] weird, but I am so glad that I'm a
[1:34:59] preacher. Hallelujah. I am so happy if
[1:35:03] there was ever a time I said, "God,
[1:35:05] thank you that you called me to preach
[1:35:07] the gospel because if I didn't, I don't
[1:35:10] know what I would do. I'd be like fire,
[1:35:12] like Jeremiah said, shut up in my
[1:35:14] bones." I'm so glad that I can have a
[1:35:16] chance to use my voice to speak against
[1:35:19] the bully of this age. I'm so glad God
[1:35:22] has given me a weapon called the word of
[1:35:25] God and I can stand against the enemy.
[1:35:29] I'm so glad that in an age of cowards,
[1:35:32] we got some men of God who will stand
[1:35:34] for the word of God and use their voice
[1:35:38] to preach it with all of their heart.
[1:35:43] I read that and Peter stood up. I said,
[1:35:45] "God, thank you that I can stand with
[1:35:47] the 11."
[1:35:50] Thank you that you've given me the cho
[1:35:52] the opportunity to stand for the word of
[1:35:54] God.
[1:35:56] Men like Joshua, men like uh you you
[1:36:00] even read it there as the Bible says
[1:36:02] they stood up like Stephen. The Bible
[1:36:04] says Stephen being stoned. He stood up
[1:36:07] and he declared what did he do? He was
[1:36:10] taking a stand for the word of God. You
[1:36:12] take men like like in in in in Joshua
[1:36:15] chapter 3 when they were going to cross
[1:36:17] over the Jordan and the Bible says that
[1:36:19] those high priests I love this example
[1:36:20] so much brother Ron because notice here
[1:36:23] here was the Jordan River and it was it
[1:36:25] represented what? Death represented,
[1:36:27] brother Adam said, represented death,
[1:36:29] represented sin, the crossing over. And
[1:36:32] the Bible says that Joshua was commanded
[1:36:35] to take 12 men, one out of each tribe to
[1:36:38] represent. These were Levites, Levitical
[1:36:40] priesthood men who were going to
[1:36:42] represent all of Israel. And the
[1:36:45] scripture says that he says, "Take a
[1:36:46] man, every one of you." He says, "Take
[1:36:48] one for each tribe." And he says, "And I
[1:36:51] want you I want you to I want you to see
[1:36:53] the significance of standing for the
[1:36:54] word of God." The Bible says that he
[1:36:57] told them, Joshua, have the priest put
[1:37:00] their foot in the
[1:37:03] Jordan. Now remember, Jordan represents
[1:37:07] death, it represents
[1:37:09] sin, right?
[1:37:12] And the scripture says that when the
[1:37:14] priest feet, not when they think about
[1:37:17] it now,
[1:37:19] not when they're trying to muster up the
[1:37:21] courage to do it, but it says when they
[1:37:24] actually put their foot in the Jordan,
[1:37:27] then the water will part. Now, not the
[1:37:30] whole Jordan, just that portion where
[1:37:32] he's standing. And so the first priest
[1:37:34] steps in, the next he puts his other
[1:37:36] foot down, and then the water parts. And
[1:37:38] then the next priest stands in, and then
[1:37:40] the water parts a little bit more. And
[1:37:42] then the next priest, Gad and Ruben and
[1:37:44] Manasseh and and Nefali and all of these
[1:37:47] Levites who were representing, notice,
[1:37:49] they were representing the whole
[1:37:51] nation. that behind their ministry was
[1:37:54] represented families and fathers and
[1:37:57] mothers,
[1:37:59] thousands of people, but they had a
[1:38:01] representative who stood for them. And
[1:38:04] he put his foot in the Jordan. And
[1:38:06] notice the Bible says that as they put
[1:38:09] their foot, footsteps mean possession.
[1:38:14] And sometimes God's waiting for you to
[1:38:15] take that risk and put your foot in
[1:38:17] there before that water will part.
[1:38:21] And the Bible says that he lines them up
[1:38:23] this way and he says all of the priests
[1:38:25] when all all 12 of them are there then
[1:38:27] Jordan you'll have a tunnel going
[1:38:28] through the middle that'll lead from
[1:38:30] this side to that side. Oh glory. And
[1:38:34] the Bible says that the people shall
[1:38:36] pass between the priests and the people
[1:38:40] will pass through them. Notice this
[1:38:41] here. I hate to do it to you brothers
[1:38:42] but come up here you too brother
[1:38:44] Matthew. Even with a bro I won't say a
[1:38:46] broken arm but a arm and a cast. Come
[1:38:48] on. Come on. Stand up here. Could Could
[1:38:50] you brothers could you stand for me?
[1:38:52] Just line up facing each other. Brother
[1:38:53] Matthew, you here? Just face each other
[1:38:56] just that way. I want you to notice that
[1:38:57] these were this is the order that God
[1:38:59] has them to cross over into Canaan. And
[1:39:02] he says that as their feet, as they
[1:39:05] stand in the water, do you now see how
[1:39:07] important it is that they stand in the
[1:39:10] Jordan for the word of God, that they're
[1:39:12] not ashamed, that they're not fearful,
[1:39:14] that they're not intimidated by the
[1:39:16] devil, but they stand no matter what it
[1:39:19] costs them, no matter what it what kind
[1:39:21] of what they Listen, friends, these men
[1:39:23] will go through things that you will
[1:39:25] never go through. They will endure
[1:39:27] battles that you will never understand.
[1:39:29] But I want to tell you they are
[1:39:31] representing your families and your
[1:39:33] fathers and your mothers and your young
[1:39:39] people. They're stand for the word of
[1:39:48] God. And notice the Bible says that as
[1:39:52] the people pass through the Jordan, they
[1:39:56] cross to the other side. Do you now see
[1:39:59] how important it is? What would happen
[1:40:02] if one of these brothers took their feet
[1:40:04] out of the Jordan?
[1:40:07] Do you realize what would happen,
[1:40:09] brother, if we would stop preaching?
[1:40:12] Come on, somebody. Do you realize what
[1:40:14] happened if we compromised for the word
[1:40:17] of God? Do you realize what would happen
[1:40:18] if these brothers bow down to your
[1:40:21] feelings?
[1:40:25] What would happen if preachers put their
[1:40:26] Bibles down? What would happen if
[1:40:28] preachers stopped preaching the word of
[1:40:30] God? Jordan sin would flood our
[1:40:33] churches. It'd flood our youth groups.
[1:40:35] It'd flood our music. It'd flood our
[1:40:38] homes. Oh, you ought to thank God for a
[1:40:41] ministry that'll stand for the word of
[1:40:44] God. Oh, hallelujah. Do we have a church
[1:40:47] that says, "Preach it, Brother Ron.
[1:40:50] Preach it, Brother William. Preach it,
[1:40:52] Brother Andrew. Keep preaching the
[1:40:54] message over the hour. Don't compromise.
[1:40:57] Don't water it down. Say it the way a
[1:40:59] prophet said it.
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:06] Hallelujah. Thank you, brothers. But now
[1:41:10] Joshua says, I want you, notice how
[1:41:12] important their stand is. I want you to
[1:41:14] take a stone from each place where they
[1:41:18] stood. Go read your Bible. Firm.
[1:41:24] the place where they planted their foot
[1:41:26] down.
[1:41:28] I'm going to tell you what, it was a
[1:41:29] firm stand.
[1:41:31] It was a firm stand. They stood for the
[1:41:36] word of God. They stood for the message
[1:41:39] of the hour. They stood for the truth of
[1:41:42] God's word. Tell you a little testimony.
[1:41:44] I use that same exact example in a
[1:41:46] church. I won't say where, but it was a
[1:41:48] church in another country. And I had no
[1:41:50] idea when I went into that church. The
[1:41:52] brother didn't tell me nothing. I had no
[1:41:54] way of knowing. Went to multiple
[1:41:56] churches. And God inspired my heart so
[1:41:58] much. And I was praying about what to
[1:42:00] preach before I went out for just
[1:42:02] driving there. Said, "Lord, give me
[1:42:04] what? Not just something good. Give me
[1:42:05] something that's right. Give me
[1:42:07] something that is for right now, right
[1:42:09] at this time, right at this moment." And
[1:42:10] I was just struggling over what to
[1:42:12] preach. And then the voice of the Lord
[1:42:13] just spoke to my heart and so confirmed
[1:42:15] it. And I said, "I know exactly what I'm
[1:42:17] going to preach." And the interpreter,
[1:42:19] the pastor who had brought me there as
[1:42:20] his as his guest, and he said, "Brother
[1:42:22] Mann," he said, "do you have a a title
[1:42:24] for tonight? Do you know what you're
[1:42:26] going to preach?" And I told him, I
[1:42:27] said, and I gave you my
[1:42:29] title, standing for the word of God. And
[1:42:33] he said, "John 3." He quotes my
[1:42:36] scriptures, the chapter, and the verse.
[1:42:38] He said, "You'll read from here. You
[1:42:40] read from here." And I thought, "My
[1:42:42] goodness, how did he know exactly what I
[1:42:44] was going to read?" And he didn't tell
[1:42:46] me nothing. After the service, he told
[1:42:48] me, he said, 'Brother Matt, this
[1:42:50] morning, he said, 'I went, He's a school
[1:42:52] teacher. He said, 'I went to work. And
[1:42:53] he said, the audible voice spoke to my
[1:42:55] heart and said, 'Go to brother Matt's
[1:42:57] church and get on their website and
[1:42:59] listen. Out of all the sermons I could
[1:43:00] have ever preached, he found that one
[1:43:02] from a year, I think it was a year
[1:43:03] before that. And he said, "God told me,
[1:43:05] listen to this sermon today."
[1:43:08] And he was going to interpret that
[1:43:10] sermon tonight.
[1:43:12] Brother, you want to talk about an
[1:43:13] anointed interpreter? He preached it
[1:43:15] better than I preached it.
[1:43:18] He knew what I was going to say before I
[1:43:19] could even say it. Before a while, I
[1:43:22] mean this uh before long, he was here
[1:43:24] and I was over here looked like the
[1:43:27] interpreter. And little did I know that
[1:43:30] there was the that church was in great
[1:43:32] turmoil because the pastor who had stood
[1:43:34] for the message for years and years and
[1:43:37] years had had got dementia and he and it
[1:43:40] sort of you know it just uh they they
[1:43:42] felt to you know he couldn't preach. So
[1:43:45] these men who were deacons of the church
[1:43:48] and and and officers of the church had
[1:43:50] taken over and I had no no idea about
[1:43:53] anything. He told me this all
[1:43:54] afterwards. Thank God. It's a church, a
[1:43:56] massive church, several hundred
[1:43:58] believers. And and and little did I know
[1:44:01] that these men were trying to slowly
[1:44:04] lead the people out of the message.
[1:44:07] And they they had been preaching things
[1:44:09] not to my not to my knowledge at all
[1:44:11] about how how we don't need a prophet.
[1:44:13] We don't need to quote what a prophet
[1:44:14] said. We don't need to say brother
[1:44:16] Brandham said. How could you ever get to
[1:44:18] that place to where you say we don't
[1:44:19] need to say that's what a brother a man
[1:44:21] claims to believe the message try to
[1:44:22] tell me brother Matt come on do we you
[1:44:24] always say brother Brandham said and
[1:44:26] brother Brandham don't you know what
[1:44:27] people think when they come in church
[1:44:28] they hear you say brother Brandon
[1:44:29] brother Brandon brother Brandon brother
[1:44:30] Brandon brother Brandham you got to say
[1:44:31] brother Brandham brother Matt come on
[1:44:32] when are we ever going to get past
[1:44:34] saying uh brother Brandham said I said
[1:44:36] brother I want to let you know right now
[1:44:38] I will never get past saying brother
[1:44:40] Brandham said I will never get past
[1:44:42] saying this is what God's prophet
[1:44:45] said I said I tell you what, I also give
[1:44:47] you some scripture. Jesus said that it
[1:44:50] might be fulfilled the word spoken by
[1:44:53] Isaiah the prophet. John said that it
[1:44:55] might be fulfilled the word spoken of
[1:44:57] Malachi the prophet. Paul said that it
[1:44:59] might be fulfilled the word spoken by
[1:45:01] Jeremiah the prophet. I say if Paul
[1:45:03] could quote a prophet, if Jesus could
[1:45:05] quote a prophet. If John Oh, help me
[1:45:08] preach tonight. We ought to say what a
[1:45:10] prophet said.
[1:45:12] I will not
[1:45:14] apologize. Hallelujah.
[1:45:17] In fact, I will be identified by the
[1:45:20] voice of that prophet one day
[1:45:23] because he preached what Paul preached.
[1:45:29] That's what these men were trying to
[1:45:30] say. Why do we got to say what brother
[1:45:31] Brandon said? Brother is brother and and
[1:45:33] and I didn't know know any of this.
[1:45:35] Didn't know all of it. Didn't know any
[1:45:36] any bit of it. He said they're trying
[1:45:38] they were solely trying to lead the
[1:45:39] church out of the message and believe
[1:45:42] the whole, you know, thing here to
[1:45:43] disbelieve. And little did I know any of
[1:45:46] that. So I'd used the same exact example
[1:45:49] that I just used and I called every
[1:45:51] single one of those men individually out
[1:45:53] of the audience to stand
[1:45:55] there. And when they were standing there
[1:45:57] representing the 12 tribes, I said, "Do
[1:46:00] you realize what would happen if these
[1:46:01] men started saying we don't need to say
[1:46:03] what brother Brandon said?" Do you
[1:46:05] realize what would happen if these men
[1:46:06] started compromising the message of the
[1:46:08] hour? That church came on fire. I didn't
[1:46:11] realize what I was saying. I couldn't
[1:46:12] even finish my words. The building about
[1:46:14] exploded when I said that. That brother
[1:46:16] told me said, "Brother Matt, you use the
[1:46:18] very same men." I want to tell you a
[1:46:20] testimony. That brother told me about
[1:46:21] six months later, he said, "Brother
[1:46:23] Matt, God has turned the whole situation
[1:46:25] around. They have ran those men out of
[1:46:27] the church and they are standing for the
[1:46:29] word of God today." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:46:33] That's my
[1:46:34] God. He'll defend his own
[1:46:37] word. Hallelujah.
[1:46:42] It's many will stand for a principle.
[1:46:45] Stand. Stand for a principle. Siri says,
[1:46:49] "I got three minutes. Can I have them?"
[1:46:56] God, let me
[1:46:57] stand. Brother Brandham says, "God, let
[1:47:01] me stand with the principles of one man,
[1:47:04] the word of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:08] For heaven and earth shall pass away,
[1:47:10] but this word will never pass away. And
[1:47:14] on this rock, I will build my church,
[1:47:16] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:47:19] against it. Brother, I got to tell you
[1:47:22] something here as the Lord inspired me
[1:47:23] to say it. It is our commission. We are
[1:47:26] not asked. I want to preach this. We are
[1:47:29] not asked. We are not suggested. We have
[1:47:33] actually been commanded
[1:47:36] to preach the word of God.
[1:47:39] Paul said, Timothy, I charge you by the
[1:47:42] living God who shall judge the quick and
[1:47:44] the dead. Preach the word of God. Be
[1:47:47] instant in season, out of season.
[1:47:50] We have been commissioned.
[1:47:54] And I want to go further than that. It
[1:47:56] is the commission of the bride to
[1:47:58] prophesy again. Amen. I want to say it
[1:48:01] was the commission of Moses to take the
[1:48:03] very thoughts of God and write them down
[1:48:05] on the tablets of stone. He was
[1:48:08] commissioned commanded to do that.
[1:48:12] It would then be the Apostle Paul. Can I
[1:48:14] preach you this here for a moment? It
[1:48:16] was then the commission and the charge
[1:48:18] to Paul to write the New Testament and
[1:48:21] express the hidden wisdom and the deep
[1:48:23] mysteries of God. It was then the
[1:48:25] commission and the charge to the seventh
[1:48:28] angel to declare the mysteries of God
[1:48:31] that were given by the apostle Paul and
[1:48:33] to unveil the mighty God before us as
[1:48:36] declared in Revelations 10:7. And then
[1:48:38] it would be these divinely revealed
[1:48:41] truths, preach with me, that will
[1:48:43] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:48:45] children back to the faith of the
[1:48:48] apostolic fathers.
[1:48:50] Oh, but can we not stop there? It is now
[1:48:53] the commission of the bride of Jesus
[1:48:55] Christ to eat the book. And you
[1:49:01] must you must
[1:49:04] what is it? It's a charge.
[1:49:07] You must prophesy again to many nations,
[1:49:11] tongues, tongues, people. So you must
[1:49:14] recognize that just as Moses was
[1:49:16] commissioned and anointed, just as Paul
[1:49:19] was commissioned and anointed, just as
[1:49:22] you say, just as brother Matt, just as
[1:49:24] the seventh angel was commissioned, this
[1:49:26] bride speaking, thus saith the Lord
[1:49:29] under her messenger will be the final
[1:49:32] voice to the final age.
[1:49:36] Brother Brandham says, "As that
[1:49:37] headstone nears the body, those in the
[1:49:39] true church will be so much like Christ.
[1:49:42] They will be in his very image." As the
[1:49:44] headstone nears the body, the dynamics
[1:49:46] of this church will be a refilling of
[1:49:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost of which
[1:49:51] we have worked in a small measure. But
[1:49:53] as the headstone nears the body, the
[1:49:55] full power of the Holy Ghost will be
[1:49:58] given to her in so much that even the
[1:50:00] dead that's been dead for hundreds of
[1:50:02] years will come up out of the grave.
[1:50:06] It is your commission.
[1:50:11] It is not an option. It is not an
[1:50:14] option. Friends, can you preach with me
[1:50:15] here tonight? It is not an option. It's
[1:50:18] our commission.
[1:50:20] And he says here, notice this. Okay,
[1:50:22] Siri, I got you.
[1:50:27] Can we go into overtime?
[1:50:31] We must eat the book. And can I just say
[1:50:34] just as every listen I can hear brother
[1:50:36] Brandham say it. I love it so much how
[1:50:38] he shows that in countdown and he shows
[1:50:40] that there was ever out of every age he
[1:50:42] says notice as as science advanced it
[1:50:45] was only the sign or indication of where
[1:50:47] God was at in history. Right? the horse
[1:50:50] and buggy. And brother Brandham says,
[1:50:52] "Notice the automobile. What was it?" It
[1:50:55] was man inventing. They thought they
[1:50:57] were inventing, but he says they were
[1:50:59] only taking the resources that was
[1:51:01] always in the earth. And then what
[1:51:04] brother Adam random said, he said, John,
[1:51:06] he said, listen that when they
[1:51:07] discovered the automobile, you know,
[1:51:09] John Henry Ford didn't discover
[1:51:10] something new. It had been there since
[1:51:13] the days of Adam.
[1:51:17] Thank God he discovered it.
[1:51:21] Cuz I wouldn't have wanted to come here
[1:51:22] on a horse and a buggy, brother Andrew.
[1:51:26] And you know, can I go further than
[1:51:27] that? And brother Brandham says just
[1:51:29] about the time that the Wright brothers,
[1:51:31] he says, we're discovering flight, there
[1:51:34] was a little group in Isuza Street, in a
[1:51:36] dingy, dark down street in a building
[1:51:38] nobody thought anything about. He says,
[1:51:40] "Just as the Wright brothers were coming
[1:51:41] off the ground, there was a church
[1:51:43] getting off the ground.
[1:51:47] And thank God they discovered the jet
[1:51:49] aircraft. I could be here in an hour."
[1:51:52] But you know what's so powerful? What
[1:51:54] Brother Brandham said? He said that.
[1:51:56] Notice the materials were already in the
[1:51:59] earth.
[1:52:01] They didn't discover them. They didn't
[1:52:03] create them. Sorry. They discovered
[1:52:06] because of what, brother Matt? because
[1:52:08] they excavated. Oh, because they dug.
[1:52:11] Because they didn't stop with what
[1:52:13] people said was impossible. They didn't
[1:52:15] listen to the bullies who said just
[1:52:17] leave it alone and he got to be a
[1:52:19] weirdo. They didn't stop with all the
[1:52:21] critics.
[1:52:22] They kept believing.
[1:52:26] You know why Christopher Columbus
[1:52:27] discovered the new world when everybody
[1:52:29] thought he was a quack. Couldn't get no
[1:52:31] money from any
[1:52:32] king. But history records that Columbus
[1:52:36] was determined. He believed there was
[1:52:38] something more beyond what was on the
[1:52:40] horizon.
[1:52:43] History records he actually went blind.
[1:52:45] Christopher Columbus because he gazed so
[1:52:47] much at the horizon. Because even after
[1:52:49] discovering the new world, he said, "I'm
[1:52:51] determined." Went to the king of of
[1:52:53] Spain and said, "I'm determined that
[1:52:54] there's more to be discovered." Oh, I
[1:52:57] think that ought to be the commission of
[1:52:59] the church of the living God. We ain't
[1:53:01] going to settle looking back to
[1:53:02] yesterday. There's more to be
[1:53:05] discovered. There's something
[1:53:07] waiting. God having left something
[1:53:10] better for
[1:53:12] us. You know what the history of course
[1:53:14] about the Wright brothers? The Wilbur
[1:53:16] and Orville Reich, North Carolina. And
[1:53:19] they discovered flight. You know, it
[1:53:21] wasn't a popular thing to believe in
[1:53:23] flying in the 18 early 1800 early 1900s.
[1:53:28] Wasn't popular, man. You were called a
[1:53:30] weirdo. You were called a quack. Come
[1:53:32] on. Flying. It was impossible.
[1:53:37] It was impossible. They they they they
[1:53:39] you know they they they lost their
[1:53:41] reputation. Couldn't get no funding. You
[1:53:43] know what the schools did? A college
[1:53:45] school funded by the government spent
[1:53:48] thousands at that time would have been
[1:53:50] thousands of dollars. But scientists,
[1:53:52] researchers, men of college education.
[1:53:55] Wilbur didn't have no college education.
[1:53:58] Orville was just a North Carolina boy.
[1:54:00] Didn't have no kind of financing behind
[1:54:02] him. Didn't even I don't think
[1:54:03] graduated. Might have graduated high
[1:54:04] school. I don't know. Had no formal
[1:54:06] education. But he had a
[1:54:09] belief. He had a belief that man had
[1:54:12] came past the horse and buggy. He came
[1:54:14] past the automobile. But there's more to
[1:54:17] be discovered. And he was rejected. You
[1:54:20] know what though? I just read a letter.
[1:54:21] Let me read it to you. I think I pulled
[1:54:22] it up here. He finally at the end of it
[1:54:24] all wrote a letter to some men. If I got
[1:54:27] it here. He he wrote a letter to
[1:54:28] Octavius Shenoot. And this is in the
[1:54:30] early 1900s when he's laughed at. He's
[1:54:33] ridiculed. He says, "It's impossible,
[1:54:35] man." What will they You know what that
[1:54:37] for forgive me. They They spent
[1:54:38] thousands of dollars from that college.
[1:54:40] And you know what they discovered? Man
[1:54:42] can't fly. It's impossible. It'll never
[1:54:44] be done. It'll never be done. We've
[1:54:45] already spent the research. We've
[1:54:47] already scientifically looked at it. We
[1:54:48] can already tell you, Wilbur, you're out
[1:54:50] of your mind. They'll never fly. We've
[1:54:51] got men of redee men of education, men
[1:54:54] with degrees. Listen, you ain't got no
[1:54:55] education. All of our doctors of
[1:54:57] divinity, all of our doctors of science
[1:54:59] have said it's impossible. Man will
[1:55:01] never fly. He'll never get up off the
[1:55:03] ground.
[1:55:05] Wilbur finally pinned a letter and he
[1:55:07] says, "For some years," this is his
[1:55:09] letter, "for some years, I want to tell
[1:55:10] you, I have been afflicted with the
[1:55:15] belief that flight is possible to land.
[1:55:18] My disease has increased in severity,
[1:55:21] and I feel that it will soon cost me an
[1:55:23] increased amount of money, if not my
[1:55:25] life. I've been trying to arrange my
[1:55:27] affairs in such a way that I can devote
[1:55:30] my entire time for a few months to
[1:55:32] experiment in this field." What was it?
[1:55:34] He was afflicted. Oh, if he could be
[1:55:36] afflicted with the belief that man will
[1:55:38] fly and the material was already there.
[1:55:40] Can I just preach to you and say that
[1:55:42] the body change and the rapture of the
[1:55:44] church.
[1:55:46] [Applause]
[1:55:48] The material is already here. And I am
[1:55:53] afflicted with a belief. I am afflicted
[1:55:56] with a
[1:55:58] disease that we shall be changed in the
[1:56:01] moment, in the twinkling of an
[1:56:03] eye. I am afflicted with a belief that
[1:56:07] there will be somebody who takes a stand
[1:56:09] against the
[1:56:13] enemy. There'd be words that would
[1:56:15] anoint and attire. Can I go just a few
[1:56:17] more minutes? Man, I feel like
[1:56:21] preaching. It would be men. It would be
[1:56:24] actually revelations 9 would prophesy of
[1:56:26] it of th,200 million demon spirits bound
[1:56:31] at the river Euphrates that tigress the
[1:56:33] Nile and the Euphrates flowed out of
[1:56:35] Eden. Abraham's from Mesopotamia means
[1:56:37] he's between from between the two
[1:56:39] rivers. You go look at Euphrates on a
[1:56:41] map. You'll find that what's on the
[1:56:43] other side of Euphrates was is Israel,
[1:56:45] Judea, the land of Israel. And the Bible
[1:56:48] says that they were bound there until a
[1:56:51] certain day. Come on. Revelations 9
[1:56:54] until a certain hour. In other words,
[1:56:57] this was
[1:56:58] specific that these 200 million demon,
[1:57:02] brother Brandham says that they were
[1:57:04] they feast of the trumpets. He says they
[1:57:06] were not literal beasts. They were not
[1:57:08] physical horsemen, but these were
[1:57:10] spiritual chargers.
[1:57:13] This was a spiritual army. Brother, you
[1:57:15] can go ahead and display it here. I hope
[1:57:16] this don't scare the liver out of you,
[1:57:18] but you can display that next one. I I
[1:57:20] display this at a youth camp. realized I
[1:57:21] had to give the young people a minute to
[1:57:23] catch their breath before I kept
[1:57:24] preaching. They looked at that
[1:57:26] picture. I asked good old chat GPT. I
[1:57:29] love it when he does good
[1:57:31] things. People use them for dumb things.
[1:57:34] I said, "Create me an image of what
[1:57:35] Revelations 9, the chargers of
[1:57:37] Revelations 9 would look like." My
[1:57:40] goodness. But I'm going to tell you what
[1:57:41] they were. They were supernatural demon
[1:57:45] chargers. that brother Brandham says was
[1:57:47] loosed spiritually, not physically, not
[1:57:50] demon swords of Jassith and Jasper and
[1:57:52] all of these kind of things breathing
[1:57:54] fire out of their nose, but they were
[1:57:56] bound. But the prophet of God picks this
[1:57:58] up. It's so powerful. And he says,
[1:58:00] notice they were bound at the river
[1:58:01] Euphrates wanting to go over to uh
[1:58:04] persecute the Jews. And he says, "But
[1:58:06] they were bound there, but under the
[1:58:07] sixth trumpet, they were when a seventh
[1:58:09] angel messenger starts to declare those
[1:58:12] demon that those spirits would be
[1:58:14] released upon the the Jews." Brother
[1:58:17] Brandham says it was the old pagan
[1:58:18] empire, old Roman Empire, sorry. He says
[1:58:21] that was that was revived. And the
[1:58:23] prophet of God said, if you believe what
[1:58:25] a prophet said, he says that spirit that
[1:58:28] was released under that sixth trumpet,
[1:58:31] got on men like Stalin, Hitler, Ikeman,
[1:58:35] Mussolini.
[1:58:37] Imagine that. Here's was that spirit
[1:58:40] that was
[1:58:42] released. It was into the atmosphere.
[1:58:45] You say, "What atmosphere?" The fourth
[1:58:47] dimension where brother Brandon says is
[1:58:49] the dimension of science. It's the
[1:58:50] traveling dimension. Remember, it's the
[1:58:52] communication. It's where he said
[1:58:54] prophets operate, see visions and dreams
[1:58:56] is in that fourth dimension. It's where
[1:58:57] diseases exist. It's that dimension of
[1:58:59] science. Notice you got a phone here and
[1:59:02] on that phone is it pulling into the
[1:59:04] dimension. Brother, I'm going to say it
[1:59:06] this way. There's in this room right now
[1:59:07] there's the voices of picture radio and
[1:59:10] he says murder, all kinds of terrible
[1:59:11] things happening, but you can't see it.
[1:59:13] You don't hear it, but yet it's here
[1:59:15] right now.
[1:59:17] And he says, "All you need is a receiver
[1:59:20] that can tune into that dimension and it
[1:59:22] will begin to pull down what was already
[1:59:24] there." And brother Brandham says that
[1:59:27] notice here that that that that in the
[1:59:29] in the in the sixth seal as we know
[1:59:31] which brother Brandham says the
[1:59:32] tribulation seal. But but brother
[1:59:35] Brandon says in the sixth seal that that
[1:59:37] spirit released a he calls it a
[1:59:40] pre-tribulation.
[1:59:44] He says that that the Jews under Hitler
[1:59:47] went through an amateur tribulation.
[1:59:49] Right? Come on, somebody. So, in other
[1:59:53] words, under the releasing of that sick
[1:59:55] seal, there was an anointing that came.
[1:59:58] And he says, what was that? Another
[2:00:00] place, brother Brandham says this, and I
[2:00:01] think three places. He says, God cannot
[2:00:04] destroy the earth until the people get
[2:00:07] in the spirit of destruction first.
[2:00:10] Right? And he says, "You got to get into
[2:00:12] the re spirit of a revival. Before you
[2:00:14] can have a revival, spirit of a healing
[2:00:15] service, we're ready to have a healing
[2:00:16] service." And he says, "And before God
[2:00:17] can pour out his wrath, the people have
[2:00:21] to first get in the spirit of wrath.
[2:00:23] They have to get Don't you realize
[2:00:25] that's what's happening today in our
[2:00:27] school? some of these professors
[2:00:29] standing with Hamas.
[2:00:31] You'd never be able to explain how
[2:00:33] thousands of soldiers of Hamas could go
[2:00:35] and cross over the border and slay
[2:00:37] babies and slay mothers and slay
[2:00:39] innocent people outside of a
[2:00:41] pre-tribulation anointing of
[2:00:44] destruction.
[2:00:48] And they have lost their minds. They've
[2:00:50] went insane. And then you got teachers
[2:00:52] in America and professors in America who
[2:00:55] will stand for that. Come on, friends.
[2:00:57] It's no wonder. You say, "How did it
[2:00:59] happen?" It was because of Biden. It was
[2:01:01] because of Hillary. It was because of
[2:01:03] And we've named so many people. I'm
[2:01:04] going to tell you why. Because a book
[2:01:06] that they have kicked out of their
[2:01:08] schools. A book that they have rejected
[2:01:13] prophesied. And a prophet said, "I
[2:01:16] prophesy to you in the name of the Lord,
[2:01:17] the world will go completely
[2:01:19] insane." And they didn't realize it. But
[2:01:22] they're under a pre-tribulation six seal
[2:01:25] anointing that causes them to come under
[2:01:28] destruction. And listen friends, America
[2:01:30] will fall under it. Zechariah 12 says
[2:01:32] that all the nations of the earth, a
[2:01:34] gentile army will surround and encompass
[2:01:37] Jerusalem to destroy it. Oh, but when
[2:01:39] you mess with Israel, you mess with the
[2:01:42] apple of God's eye. When you mess with
[2:01:44] the family of God, you are messing with
[2:01:46] the wife of Jehovah himself. And when
[2:01:49] you pick on Israel, you are picking on
[2:01:51] the apple of his eye.
[2:01:54] God says, "In that day, I will come down
[2:01:56] to fight for Israel. And I will pour out
[2:01:59] my spirit of grace and
[2:02:01] supplication." And notice this here.
[2:02:03] They fell under a
[2:02:05] pre-tribulation anointing of
[2:02:07] destruction. Well, I just happen to
[2:02:08] believe, brother Ron, that if there was
[2:02:10] a pre-tribulation anointing that anoints
[2:02:12] an entire people and prophesies them
[2:02:14] into the mark of the beast and the
[2:02:16] tribulation, then there must be a
[2:02:18] seventh seal anointing that was released
[2:02:20] at the coming of the Lord. Oh, h,
[2:02:22] somebody help me preach tonight. And if
[2:02:24] they can use an anointing to go insane,
[2:02:27] I believe I have an anointing that I
[2:02:29] could come under to believe every word,
[2:02:32] to declare every promise, to stand for
[2:02:34] everything God gave me.
[2:02:40] We're under that anointing right now.
[2:02:43] And one day it'll change our bodies.
[2:02:47] Say, "What is the body change, brother
[2:02:48] Matt?" It is only my body receiving what
[2:02:51] my soul has already received.
[2:02:55] And they didn't know they were under
[2:02:56] that anointing. Hitler didn't know it
[2:02:58] when he started preaching his sermons
[2:03:00] cuz really that's what they were. What
[2:03:02] they were. You can go to the next one.
[2:03:03] When Hitler stood behind a microphone,
[2:03:05] notice voices, words, words. These were
[2:03:09] words he spoke and it anointed people's
[2:03:12] faith to believe. Did you know Hitler?
[2:03:16] Go look me up. You can Google me if you
[2:03:17] want. You'll find it's true.
[2:03:21] Hitler believed he was a
[2:03:23] prophet. In fact, he said, "I'm like one
[2:03:26] of the old prophets of Israel, the
[2:03:27] prophets of the Old Testament."
[2:03:30] He actually prophesied that he would
[2:03:32] become the chancellor of Germany. And
[2:03:35] you can go back and and you can listen.
[2:03:37] They've now taken artificial
[2:03:38] intelligence and tooken his very words
[2:03:40] and they have digitized them in such a
[2:03:42] way to hear it in English but with the
[2:03:44] same voice that he had. And boy, I tell
[2:03:46] you what, he was a
[2:03:48] preacher and he preached with words. You
[2:03:51] say, "How could people how, brother
[2:03:53] Matt, you go to I've been to Burkan.
[2:03:55] I've been to Ashawitz. I've been to Dao
[2:03:56] and it doesn't make sense. How How does
[2:04:00] it make sense? This is not years ago.
[2:04:02] This is not a 100 years ago. This is the
[2:04:03] 1940s.
[2:04:05] How does people not not just Hitler, go
[2:04:08] to the next slide. Young people, an
[2:04:10] entire generation of
[2:04:12] youth, in fact, after the war, there was
[2:04:15] an entire program for 13 years called
[2:04:18] deprogramming the Hitler Youth.
[2:04:22] Cuz they You say, "How did that happen,
[2:04:24] brother Matt?" They listened to a
[2:04:26] preacher preach a sermon under an
[2:04:28] anointing. It was an anointing of the
[2:04:30] sixth seal. And brother Brandon said
[2:04:32] that anointing fell on Stalin, Hitler,
[2:04:34] Ikeman, Mussolini. And he said to
[2:04:36] persecute. It was those 200 million
[2:04:38] demons that crossed the river Euphrates
[2:04:40] to attack the Jews. It was the same
[2:04:43] spirit that was on the Hamas fighters.
[2:04:45] And it's the same spirit that's in our
[2:04:46] world today. And one day, it will be the
[2:04:48] same spirit that leads an entire gentile
[2:04:51] United Nations army to try to destroy
[2:04:53] Israel.
[2:04:55] You see, people don't realize it's the
[2:04:56] words that they're feeding upon that
[2:04:58] will change them
[2:05:01] and they fed upon it so much. Hitler's
[2:05:04] voice and his words begin to ring out.
[2:05:06] And he prophesied and said, "I prophesy
[2:05:09] to you." He gets up before the the the
[2:05:11] before the invasion of of Poland. And he
[2:05:14] gets up behind a microphone. He takes a
[2:05:16] microphone and starts to preach his
[2:05:18] sermon and said, "I prophesy to you that
[2:05:21] if this leads to a world war, he said, I
[2:05:24] prophesy, you go listen to it, that it
[2:05:27] will end with the extermination of the
[2:05:30] Jewish people." Well, I got news for
[2:05:33] you, Hitler. You're a false prophet.
[2:05:41] And I got news for the devil tonight.
[2:05:44] There's already another prophecy over my
[2:05:46] life. There's already a prophecy over my
[2:05:49] children. And you can't have them. You
[2:05:51] can't have my home. You can't have my
[2:05:53] children. You can't have my
[2:05:56] mind. Prophesy all you want, but I've
[2:05:59] already got a prophecy over my life.
[2:06:05] Hallelujah.
[2:06:12] And he prophesies those words that he
[2:06:14] says, I prophesied it will end with the
[2:06:16] extermination of the entire Jewish race.
[2:06:17] You know what he does? He changes the
[2:06:19] Bible. He takes the Bible and he
[2:06:21] rewrites it to an Aryan Bible. He
[2:06:23] removed every reference of the Jewish
[2:06:25] people in that Bible and he forced his
[2:06:27] preachers to preach it in their
[2:06:28] churches. I'm telling you real history.
[2:06:31] Say, "Brother Matt, what is the
[2:06:32] significance?" I'm going to tell you the
[2:06:33] significance. He's trying to do the same
[2:06:35] thing today by watering down the word
[2:06:37] and changing the meaning of the word and
[2:06:40] watering it down and deleted diluting it
[2:06:42] with all kinds of opinions of men and
[2:06:44] all kinds of hybrid of men.
[2:06:48] And they believed that word so much that
[2:06:51] it anointed an entire generation of
[2:06:53] people to hate the Jews so much. You
[2:06:57] know what it was? It was the devil.
[2:07:00] You say it was Hitler. It was the devil
[2:07:02] anointing him. Say, why, brother Matt?
[2:07:05] Why does God Why does the devil hate the
[2:07:08] Jews so much? Is it the Hebrew language?
[2:07:11] No. Is it their dress code? Does he hate
[2:07:14] that? No. Is it the color of their skin?
[2:07:16] No. That's not why he hates them so
[2:07:18] much. I'm going to give you one reason
[2:07:20] why he hates the Jews so much. Cuz God
[2:07:22] loves them above everybody else in the
[2:07:26] whole world.
[2:07:29] He tells through Isaiah, I think it was,
[2:07:31] you are my peculiar treasure. I've
[2:07:32] chosen you above. I know people don't
[2:07:34] like that word. It's not fair. We're
[2:07:36] above. I'm going to tell you what God
[2:07:38] said. I've chosen you above all the
[2:07:40] peoples of the earth. It's not about
[2:07:42] fair or unfair. It's election. It's not
[2:07:45] fair uh that that that that my son is my
[2:07:48] son. It's not about fair that other boys
[2:07:49] are not my son. He became my son because
[2:07:51] he came from me.
[2:07:54] Election is not fair or unfair. I came
[2:07:57] from God. I'll go back to God. I was
[2:08:00] never in the mind of Satan. So I can
[2:08:02] never be in his path. I'll always be in
[2:08:05] the plan of God because I came from God.
[2:08:11] He hates them because God loves them so
[2:08:14] much. That's why he hates you. That's
[2:08:16] why he tries to destroy
[2:08:19] you. And they didn't know that they were
[2:08:21] listening to the words of a bully.
[2:08:26] And he bullied them and bullied them and
[2:08:29] bullied them. Invaded Poland. And he
[2:08:31] takes over Poland. Then he invades
[2:08:33] France and takes over France. And it
[2:08:35] just looks like the bully's going to get
[2:08:36] everything, man. He's just marching
[2:08:38] through, marching through and marching
[2:08:40] through. And then he comes to Great
[2:08:42] Britain. But I want to tell you
[2:08:44] something. There was a little man.
[2:08:45] Hitler had a microphone, but there was
[2:08:47] another man who took a microphone. A
[2:08:49] little man named Winston
[2:08:51] Churchill. I want to tell you what
[2:08:53] Churchill was. He was a man who stood up
[2:08:56] to the bully.
[2:08:58] You know what John F. Kennedy said about
[2:08:59] this little man. He said Winston
[2:09:01] Churchill didn't have no army. He didn't
[2:09:04] have no army. He didn't have no tanks.
[2:09:07] He didn't have no air. Nothing that
[2:09:09] could all of Germany was invaded Poland,
[2:09:11] invaded France. Looked like the next
[2:09:13] thing he would just steamroll the the
[2:09:15] the the the entire world, entire
[2:09:18] European world. And here was Winston
[2:09:20] Churchill. And JFK said he didn't have
[2:09:23] an army. He didn't have tanks. He didn't
[2:09:25] have an army to fight them. So, you know
[2:09:26] what Churchill did? John F. K said
[2:09:28] Churchill took a microphone
[2:09:34] and he says and he took words and he
[2:09:36] weaponized words and he sent them into
[2:09:39] battle.
[2:09:41] Oh, you could preach that right there,
[2:09:42] brother. He took words and he sent them
[2:09:46] into battle. And here was families,
[2:09:49] mothers, children, dads, moms, business
[2:09:51] owners, gathered up, bullied by the
[2:09:54] devil, thinking it was their last last
[2:09:57] chance. You know that they they were
[2:09:59] there gathered with in their homes,
[2:10:00] everybody afraid, everybody scared. But
[2:10:03] Winston Churchill took a microphone, got
[2:10:05] on a radio. I'm going to read you. I
[2:10:07] know you you might have heard it before,
[2:10:09] but I'm going to read you some of his
[2:10:10] words. He began to preach and he said
[2:10:13] even though large tracks of Europe and
[2:10:15] many old and famous states have fallen
[2:10:18] or may fall into the grip of the
[2:10:20] Gustapo. Oh, I feel the anointing of the
[2:10:22] Holy Ghost. Let me say that even though
[2:10:25] some have walked away from this message,
[2:10:27] even though some have declared it
[2:10:28] unholy, even though some have taken
[2:10:31] pastors who stood for this word have
[2:10:33] walked away, preachers who stood for
[2:10:34] this word have said it ain't worth
[2:10:36] fighting for. I'm here to give you the
[2:10:38] word of God tonight. Even though others
[2:10:40] have fallen and have fallen to the grip
[2:10:42] of the escapo, we shall not fail.
[2:10:48] We shall go on to the
[2:10:50] end. We shall fight in France. We shall
[2:10:53] fight in the seas and the oceans. We
[2:10:56] shall fight with growing confidence and
[2:10:59] growing strength in the air. I love
[2:11:01] this. We shall defend our island
[2:11:05] whatever the cost may be. We shall fight
[2:11:10] on the beach. We shall fight on the
[2:11:12] landing grounds. We shall fight in the
[2:11:14] fields and in the streets. We shall
[2:11:17] fight on the hills. But we shall never
[2:11:21] surrender.
[2:11:25] And even if which I do not for a moment
[2:11:27] believe this island or a large part of
[2:11:28] it were subjugated and starving that our
[2:11:31] empire by the seas guarded by the
[2:11:32] flitterish freak would carry on the
[2:11:34] struggle until in God's good time the
[2:11:38] new world with all of its power and
[2:11:39] might steps forth to rescue the
[2:11:42] liberation of the old. What was it here?
[2:11:44] Churchill said I want you I want you to
[2:11:46] hear my voice. Hitler we shall I want
[2:11:48] you to know this. You might have had a
[2:11:50] lot of victory. You might have had a lot
[2:11:52] of success and it may look like you got
[2:11:54] other churches. It may look like you m
[2:11:56] you you might even have got me to fall
[2:11:58] sometimes. But I want to give you my
[2:12:00] resolve. I will never quit. I will never
[2:12:03] back down. If you knock me down, I'm
[2:12:06] going to get back up. We shall never
[2:12:13] never. I will never back down to cancer.
[2:12:17] I will never back down to TB. I will
[2:12:19] never back down to to to depression and
[2:12:23] anxiety. You ought to let the devil
[2:12:25] know, I will never surrender my
[2:12:27] children. I will never surrender them.
[2:12:30] Doesn't matter what it looks like,
[2:12:35] Satan. What did he do with his voice? He
[2:12:38] began to anoint the faith of a
[2:12:40] generation to fight. Oh, I'm glad for a
[2:12:42] man named Winston Churchill who took a
[2:12:44] microphone. But can I tell you who I'm
[2:12:46] even more glad about? I'm glad about the
[2:12:48] next slide of a seventh angel messenger
[2:12:51] who took a microphone.
[2:12:55] [Applause]
[2:12:57] I'm talking about a preacher when the
[2:13:00] when the grip of the enemy came against
[2:13:01] the church and the spirit of God was
[2:13:03] bound for thousands of years. Brother
[2:13:05] Adam said the Holy Ghost was bound. But
[2:13:07] he began to declare he is not coming. He
[2:13:10] is not on his way. He is here.
[2:13:16] Hallelujah.
[2:13:18] I'm glad that there's a seventh angel
[2:13:20] messenger and I've heard the voice.
[2:13:24] [Applause]
[2:13:25] Oh, stand to your feet with me and
[2:13:27] rejoice this evening. I'm so glad I have
[2:13:30] heard the message of Malachi.
[2:13:36] Oh, give him a praise offering
[2:13:41] everybody. Hallelujah.
[2:13:50] And you don't got to back down to that
[2:13:52] bully. You don't got to fight to find
[2:13:54] yourself in a corner somewhere. You
[2:13:56] don't have to compromise. You don't have
[2:13:58] to negotiate with him. He's already, let
[2:14:00] me give you the words of brother Bham.
[2:14:02] He's already been defeated.
[2:14:06] He's just a bluff. He's just a bluff. As
[2:14:09] the man says, every time he would say
[2:14:11] boo, he said, I back up. He said that
[2:14:13] little devil would get a little bit
[2:14:14] bigger and he'd say, "Boo's voice became
[2:14:16] a get a little bit louder." And and the
[2:14:18] man, Brother Brandon said, "The man
[2:14:19] would back up even more." He said, "I
[2:14:20] noticed every time I'd back up, he'd get
[2:14:22] bigger." And he said, "You know what I
[2:14:23] did? I said, "Boo back."
[2:14:27] And he said, "Every time I said boo,
[2:14:28] he'd get smaller." And every time I said
[2:14:31] boo, he'd get smaller. I tell you what
[2:14:33] you ought to do to the devil tonight.
[2:14:35] You ought to stop letting him have the
[2:14:37] microphone. Take the microphone from his
[2:14:39] hand and say, "You've done enough
[2:14:40] talking. You've done enough accusing
[2:14:42] Satan. You've done enough criticizing.
[2:14:45] It's time for you to hear my voice. I am
[2:14:48] a son of God. I am a seed of Abraham.
[2:14:50] And the gates, the seed of Abraham shall
[2:14:53] possess the gates of the enemy. I am
[2:14:56] bloodbought, washed in his blood,
[2:14:58] sanctified by his blood. And one day
[2:15:01] I'll go out of this dimension, Satan.
[2:15:03] One day you won't be able to attack me
[2:15:05] anymore. You can't attack my home, my
[2:15:07] family, my mind, my body. One day,
[2:15:09] Satan, I'll rid you completely out of my
[2:15:11] life.
[2:15:14] Hallelujah.
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:39] Oh, I've been
[2:15:44] changed.
[2:15:47] Oh, somebody say, "I'm
[2:15:53] free." Oh, deliver. Say, "I found
[2:15:57] joy." I found joy.
[2:16:02] Oh. Oh,

[2:16:20] of the Lord. I've been

[2:16:40] joy. Oh,

[2:16:44] peace. I found his
[2:16:49] grace and favor. And right
[2:16:54] now and right now is the
[2:16:59] moment.
[2:17:01] Today I've been changed. I've been
[2:17:09] changed. I've been changed. And I
[2:17:13] waited. And I
[2:17:16] waited for this moment to come.
[2:17:22] and I won't let it
[2:17:30] pass. So I say I won't go back. I can't
[2:17:36] go
[2:17:37] back to the way you used to
[2:17:42] be for your presence.
[2:17:45] [Music]
[2:17:47] Oh, I won't go
[2:17:50] back. I won't go back. I can't go back
[2:17:57] to the way it used to be. Before your
[2:18:03] presence came and changed me.
[2:18:09] Oh my

[2:18:32] shame. Tell that bully no more.

[2:18:40] pass.
[2:18:42] Hallelujah. It is over right
[2:18:46] now and right now is the
[2:18:52] moment.
[2:18:54] Today the
[2:18:56] day I've been
[2:18:59] changed. I've been changed. I've been
[2:19:03] changed. I can't
[2:19:06] wait. I can't
[2:19:09] wait for this morning to come to
[2:19:17] my pass.
[2:19:24] So I
[2:19:28] say I came back to you the way it used
[2:19:34] to be before your
[2:19:38] [Music]
[2:19:47] resurre I can't go back to the way you
[2:19:54] to be before your presence came and
[2:19:59] changed
[2:20:03] me. Hallelujah.
[2:20:06] Hallelujah.
[2:20:10] How many's going to stand up that
[2:20:11] bullying?
[2:20:14] Come on, somebody. Who's going to stand
[2:20:15] up that bullying?
[2:20:17] You know good and well he's trying to
[2:20:19] bully you around but ain't nothing but
[2:20:21] empty gestures and empty empty lies. He
[2:20:24] has prophesied false things over top of
[2:20:26] you and they ain't coming to pass
[2:20:29] because we had a true prophet stand in
[2:20:31] this generation and said you would be
[2:20:33] the final voice of the final generation
[2:20:36] in this age. That's who I am.
[2:20:41] I'm an overcomer.
[2:20:47] I'm an
[2:20:50] overcomer by the blood of the
[2:20:55] lamb and by the
[2:20:57] word of my
[2:21:01] testimony overcomer.
[2:21:05] [Music]
[2:21:06] I'm an
[2:21:09] overcomer by the blood of the
[2:21:14] lamb and by the
[2:21:17] word of my
[2:21:19] testimony he saved
[2:21:24] me. He resedued me.
[2:21:30] He delivered
[2:21:33] me and he set me
[2:21:38] free. And ever since I've been changed,
[2:21:46] I can lift my
[2:21:48] hands. I can lift my hands. Oh, come on,
[2:21:52] somebody. Thank you. Thank you for your
[2:21:58] grace.
[2:22:02] Overcomer. I'm an
[2:22:07] overcomer. By the blood of the
[2:22:11] lamb and by the
[2:22:14] word of my
[2:22:17] testimony,
[2:22:19] overcome more than a conqueror. I'm a
[2:22:24] winner. The joy of the Lord is my
[2:22:27] strength.
[2:22:29] I have
[2:22:31] to and I walk in for
[2:22:36] a wash in the blood. I kept by his
[2:22:41] blood. I feel with his spirit and by his
[2:22:45] stripes I
