Swear these days it's all that I'm hearing. I used to know who I was. Now I look in the mirror and I'm not so sure. Lord, I don't want to listen to the lies anymore. The truth is I am a father's child. I'll make him proud and I'll make him smile. I was made in the image of a perfect king. Looks at me wouldn't change a thing. The truth is I am truly loved by a God who's good when I'm not good enough. I don't belong to the lies. I belong to you and that's the truth. When I feel like there's so much noise living free in my head, heaven finds me in a still small voice and it sounds like grace instead. You remind me who I am when I look in the mirror and I'm not so sure. Lord, I don't want to listen to the lies anymore. The truth is I am a father's child. I make him proud and I make him smile. I was made in the image of a perfect king. He looks at me and wouldn't change a thing. The truth is I am truly loved by a God who's good when I'm not good enough. I don't belong to the lies. I belong to you. And that's the truth. I know who I am cuz I know who you are. And I hold your truth inside my heart. I know the lies are always going to try and find me, but I've never been so sure. The truth is I am my father's child. I make him proud and I make him smile. is made in the image of a perfect king. He looks at me wouldn't change a thing. The truth is I am truly loved by a God who's good when I'm not good enough. I don't belong to the lies. I belong to you. And that's the truth. And that's the truth. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I just want to say thank you for all of your prayers and everything that y'all have done for me. Um, [Music] sorry.

I was glad to glad to have you sing, man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, man. Good to be here this evening, isn't it? &gt;&gt; We want to be praying for the Biscll family and Cloverdale Bible Way there, the bride around the world. We certainly loved our brother Ed Bisll. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He did a lot for each and every one of us whether you knew it or not. &gt;&gt; He was a trailblazer. That's right. for this message for this bride around the world. And he said, "If I could ever say what could what could I say I wanted to be remembered for?" Said he did what he could. And I say he did exactly that. He did everything that he could. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything. He laid it all on the line. That's right. &gt;&gt; So tonight, that's what I want to do. &gt;&gt; I want to lay it all on the line. &gt;&gt; That's what I want you to do. &gt;&gt; So I challenge you. &gt;&gt; Lay it all on the line. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe we'll just go to prayer at this moment. Our dear heavenly father, Lord, we thank you for just letting us be able to gather here this evening. God, we can feel your presence hold so near right now. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh God, as as we read these scriptures, the things that I've studied, Lord, put many hours into it, Lord. It's it's going to take you to lift it off the pages, to flow through our ears, into our hearts, into our souls. And I ask you that you'll just let us just open up to it this evening, God. Whatever you would have for the hearers, Lord, let us just have a heart that would receive it. Now God, I ask you that you'll just be with us this evening, Lord. Lord, bless the word that we're going to read. Lord, bless this bride. Bless the bride around the world, Lord. The Cloverdale Bible Way, the family there, Lord, the ministers that'll be speaking tomorrow. God, I ask you that you'll just minister to them all. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray these things. Amen and amen. Amen. And if you would, I'd like to turn in our scriptures this evening to Matthew 4 and verse 12. &gt;&gt; This evening, I'd like to speak on the effect of that great light. So if you just bear with me this evening, I have a lot of scriptures and hopefully it can be lifted off the pages into each and every one of our hearts. So Matthew Matthew 4 and verse 12 it says now when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of Zebulon and Nephilim. And it came that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The land of Zeblon, and the land of Nephilim, by the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee, of the Gentiles, the people which sat in darkness saw great light. And to them which sat in the region of the shadow of death, light is sprung up." &gt;&gt; Amen. And from that time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Amen. You can be seated this evening. May God have his blessings on the reader of the word. So as I said, I'd like to preach on the effect of that great light. &gt;&gt; And we love love light. We love it here this evening. It would be dark as all get out if we didn't have light. And so as I as I studied on this, I thought about a story that I could tell y'all of when I was bow hunting years and years ago in National Forest and uh and where I would go. Dave and Jerry's been there with me and uh it's about a 45minute walk through the woods on this road and and so I'm about 30 minutes from where I'm supposed to be at. And I got a little much up here on the platform. if you turn me down just a little bit. Little bit of an echo. And so I'm about 30 minutes from my truck and getting close to where I'm supposed to be at. And it was dark and I had a flashlight and it's bow season and I had a bow and my light went out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pitch dark. I'm carrying a bow, no light. And it was about the time that we didn't have all these flashlights on your cell phones and and I just had a cell phone, you know, that's that's about all. But about the time that my light went out, a pack of coyotes &gt;&gt; started howling in the valley. Just felt like it was really close. And you know, darkness, when it's dark like that, sound seems to travel. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on. So, here I am in the pitch black, no light, trying to get to where I'm supposed to be by moonlight and it was very little. So, I was going more for kind of the shadows of things. And about that time in the morning, there's darkness that will play tricks on you. &gt;&gt; And then fear began to set in. And I began to turn back and look around. I kept hearing coyotes. And it felt like they was following me. And then I thought, well, maybe somebody's going to be coming up behind me and they can grab me. And I mean, this is National Forest. Nobody's going to know where I'm at here. I mean, I have a bow. It's not a rifle. It's a bow. Very, very lacking in response time. So, I managed to make my way to my treeand in dark. And when it become light, I didn't fear no more. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That the greatest light naturally was shining. &gt;&gt; Even if I had a flashlight, it would have did me no good at that point. &gt;&gt; And the things that was scaring me in the dark, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; They didn't scare me no more. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I could turn around and see there's nobody for 300 yards. &gt;&gt; Only an idiot would go where I was. in the dark. &gt;&gt; But you know that that darkness did something. It set a fear inside of me. &gt;&gt; It made my mind play tricks on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But until that great light, come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Then it cast all those shadows away. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it like this. The sun is the king of all lights on this earth in natural lights. No matter how much artificial light we can have, like I said, or how many great electric rays we can produce, when that sun rises, all the rest of them dim out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is the same thing with the word of God. When the word of God rises, all superstitions, denominational fanaticisms, and things spread away and it shows exactly what it is. God in the beginning said, "Let there be light." And the light only comes, the true light, the king light comes by the word of God. God separated light from the darkness in the beginning. And the word of God made manifest always separates light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; So I'd like to go into our scripture readings that we had this evening and I'd like to break them down just a little bit further into each one of their meetings. And in verse 12 it says, "Now when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, John the Baptist was preparing the way of the Lord. In Matthew 3 and 2 and 3, it says, "And saying, John the Baptist was preaching, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this is he that was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, saying, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So John is doing what he could. He was preaching his his word &gt;&gt; and here's Jesus and he hears that John is now cast into prison. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So Jesus didn't go and comfort John, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He goes, as I was as you would say, he is now receiving the baton to continue his message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I am sure that there was people that was following John the Baptist that would not follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; The same thing happens in today. &gt;&gt; There is people that will follow William Brandham, but that as far as they'll go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They won't go no further. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; And so Jesus departed and he went into Galilee. He didn't go to comfort John, but he went into Galilee. And this marks a turning point in their ministry there. Jesus doesn't go to Jerusalem, the most holy city there is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To show God's plan in the most holy city. He goes to Galilee, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernium. So you see now Galilee is a region. So let's just let's just say it like this. We're in Rockingham County and let's say Grotto is kind of Nazareth and and I'm just trying to give you a comparison of what we're what we're dealing with here. And and so that's the same county but he's going into more of Galilee than northern part as we would say of Galilee. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And so that would be putting in your mind of Timberville. So southern part is Gro. Timberville is the northernmost part. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's now in Capernium which is by the sea. And the reason why God chooses Galilee is because it was prophesied of a fulfillment of prophecy by Isaiah in Isaiah 9 and2. And the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light. &gt;&gt; They that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. See, this is Isaiah's prophecy &gt;&gt; in Isaiah. And you go on down a little further and it says in verse 6, it says, "For unto us a child is born, for unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be called wonderful counselor." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. So here we are seeing prophecy being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Right? Amen. &gt;&gt; When he goes into Galilee, people that set walked in darkness have seen a great light. What is darkness? Darkness is ignorance, sin, &gt;&gt; despair, &gt;&gt; spiritual blindness, &gt;&gt; what is that great light? It's Jesus himself bringing revelation, truth, and hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They would call it Galilee of the Gentiles. See, it shows that he is willing to go into dark places. That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Spiritually dark places. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the reason why we know that Isaiah is saying that this is a Galilee is such a dark place is Isaiah would say in not Isaiah, but in 2 Kings and 15, there are some names there that I cannot pronounce. And so I'm just going to say Assyrians had taken the Galileans captive. &gt;&gt; And so the Assyrians had brought the Galileans away from there. And so they kind of uh more of deportation &gt;&gt; had pulled the Galileans into Syria. And so with that being said, the Galilee is now a place where more people was coming. Not just Jews, but Assyrians, a mixture of pe people. This is be starting to become a a bread basket of people of gods, &gt;&gt; Jews, &gt;&gt; Gentiles. &gt;&gt; So, it's becoming a very dark place in the spiritual realm. That's &gt;&gt; right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a bright place. It's not the religious city of Jerusalem, but Galilee is where he chose to start his ministry. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Not just start it. He chose to then go get disciples from that point. &gt;&gt; Come on, man. &gt;&gt; So, you may be in darkness in this time, in this day, but God has chosen you, sir. Come on. &gt;&gt; He has chosen you to step out and say, "I want a bride, a gentile bride. &gt;&gt; A bride that is in the darkness, but I'm bringing her out in revelation here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, he began to preach, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Now I am sure that there was Sadducees and other Jewish rel leaders that had tried to go up there and they tried to condemn &gt;&gt; condemn the Galileans for the way that they was living. Condemning them for their gods. But you see there's a difference in repentance and condemning someone. &gt;&gt; See, repentance is a positive. It's a constructive act involving a change of mind, heart to turn away from sin and towards God &gt;&gt; leading to forgiveness, hope, and a fresh start. Condemnation is a negative. It's a state of being fueled with guilt, &gt;&gt; shame, despair. And it drives one away from God and denies the posit possibilities of grace and forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Amen. While both feelings involve sorrow over sin, repentance leads to salvation. &gt;&gt; It leads to restoration. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whereas condemnation leads to hopelessness and spiritual death. And so here we see all of the Galileans with all of these Jewish leaders with condemning. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They felt condemned, but they didn't know what to do. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on. as they was being condemned. Well, what what good is there? We're so far away from Jerusalem that you're condemning us for living in Galilee, but we can't move to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be So, what do we do? They had nothing to provide. No light to give them spiritually. &gt;&gt; Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; So, here's Jesus giving them light. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is giving them light for what they are in at this moment. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 1, it says, "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the waters." See, Jesus didn't start a new creation then. &gt;&gt; God was used to starting new creations, &gt;&gt; right? But see, God didn't leave everything in darkness. He spoke, "Let there be light." And there was light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. &gt;&gt; Now, don't miss this. &gt;&gt; Don't miss this. When he spoke that, darkness fled. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; There was a mist upon all of the region of the earth, &gt;&gt; but there was no light until God spoke, "Let there be light." &gt;&gt; He created light. &gt;&gt; This is natural light. &gt;&gt; He is creating natural light. That's right. &gt;&gt; He is calling darkness suppressing it and calling chaos out of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bringing order out of chaos. &gt;&gt; And he's doing the same thing in your life. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on now. &gt;&gt; When he's shining the light on you, he's bringing order into chaos. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For he said, "Repent because my kingdom is at hand and his light will shine on you." In shalom, brother Brandham says, "What is light?" It is the vindicated spoken word of God. &gt;&gt; Outside of that, there is no light. &gt;&gt; You can't lighten the earth by flashlights. It takes God word to manifest the sun. &gt;&gt; See, Jesus didn't go down there with a stream light or a spotlight and a pack of dur Duracells. &gt;&gt; That's amen. &gt;&gt; He read the scriptures. He knew. Isaiah said, "The people that sat in great darkness, why don't we take them a flashlight?" &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Well, there you go. Can you see? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you see? So, I want to speak it so plainly that even the children understand it's not a flashlight that Jesus brought down to them. That's right. &gt;&gt; He was the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He was the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How do we know he was the light? Well, let's just go to that. See, there was wise men that come from afar. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on. &gt;&gt; See, and Jesus will draw people from many nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. &gt;&gt; And when those wise men come to Herod, they said, "We have come to worship him. We have followed that light." &gt;&gt; We have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And there they stood, spellbound. They couldn't speak another word, for the glory of the light had spellbound them." Oh, how it is today, my poor, decrepit friend. And when a man who has never known his power to give new light, to give new hope, when he walks into the presence of the divine person of Christ with faith that holds him spellbound to his majesty, it isn't like walking into to an altar or giving the minister your right hand. or neither is it like going to the pool to be baptized or standing with a shell to be sprinkled. It's walking into the light that you have never witnessed before. &gt;&gt; It's an anchor of divine faith that calls anything contrary to the word of God as though it wasn't. &gt;&gt; It puts new life. It gives hope to the dying. It gives courage to the weak. It gives healing to the sick. It gives blessing to the unfavored. How wonderful it is to step into that light of his presence. &gt;&gt; It's not a myth. Neither is it something that somebody just fleshly in their minds drawled up. But it's something that directly into the presence of the king of glory, the eternal light of the living God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. There they stood spellbound, couldn't speak a word because of his presence. &gt;&gt; Because he is here. &gt;&gt; We have come far to worship him. See, there was something that was drawing them out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we can see that even in the natural. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the natural, we can see how that light, you can put bury a seed under a slab of concrete, &gt;&gt; concrete that thing over. &gt;&gt; That's right. But there is something about that natural sun that when it begins to heat up that concrete, when it begins to heat up that ground, there's something in that seed that it says &gt;&gt; there's something more. &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on. &gt;&gt; There's something more. And it begins to wiggle its way maybe for miles and miles. It begins to just travel. And there at the edge of that concrete, &gt;&gt; there comes life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is it? Because there was something that was drawing at. It was a light &gt;&gt; that was pulling it. &gt;&gt; It was a light that was pulling them wise men. &gt;&gt; And that light will pull wise men. &gt;&gt; See, if you're you're in the darkness and there's something that's drawing you, &gt;&gt; you may have darkness all around you in your life. But you know that there is something that's pulling you that keeps going pulling you and you're like, I don't know what it is, but it continues to just pull me, pull me because there is a seed laying on the inside of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was something that was drawing you. Now, it wasn't the natural son that was drawing you. It was God. &gt;&gt; He was calling you. Said, "I'm going to call you up a little higher. I need some worshippers. I need a bride in this last gentile age. &gt;&gt; When this age is the darkest of all ages, he said, "I am the light &gt;&gt; that has draw you back to me." &gt;&gt; Amen. See, in him there is no darkness whatsoever. &gt;&gt; You can take a flashlight and I talked to a coal miner one time and he said that you go down into those coal mines of West Virginia and it is so dark in the darkest parts of that earth that you cannot see your hand in front of your face. But when you pull out a light, that thing lights up what you're looking at. But you see, there is no light. There is no darkness inside of where that light is. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; We're in the darkest of the darkest places, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you could see maybe it's a circular light. It's a circle. Well, inside of that circle, there is no darkness, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Maybe it's a square &gt;&gt; inside of that square of that light. Natural, I'm talking about a flashlight. There is no darkness inside of that. &gt;&gt; Right? But see, there then comes maybe a hand. It creates a shadow. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would talk about a false light. &gt;&gt; That is maybe the greatest robbery that has ever happened in history. It was due to a false light. &gt;&gt; It was a glare. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The train that was coming down through there that was carrying over $7 million worth of jewels or money, whatever it would have been. But that robbery is done by a false light. &gt;&gt; And that's what Satan has tried to do in this last day is to catch you by a false &gt;&gt; false light. &gt;&gt; By a glare, &gt;&gt; see, he knows he can't produce light. &gt;&gt; So he has to be a glare of the true light. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you see that that glare is causing people to go astray. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on. &gt;&gt; Causing people to go outside of that light. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Draws you a light &gt;&gt; away. Not a light because he cannot produce light. &gt;&gt; Oh, there's only one that gives light that is God. &gt;&gt; Amen. See now he produces and creates but he also separates. &gt;&gt; He separate the light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; See when he gets ready to leave or to use a group of people he has to separate the light from the darkness. When he gets ready to use an individual he has to separate the light from the darkness. Light comes by God. And remember the light come by his spoken word. The word of God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. There was and when there was no light, he sent the light to separate the darkness from the light. First John, excuse me, John 1 and1. It says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was God and the word was with God. And the same in the beginning with God, all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light that shineth in darkness, and darkness comprehended it not." &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; See Jesus being that light. There is darkness. But the darkness cannot comprehend &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; See, we know that Jesus was that light because scripture con consistently identifies him that way. &gt;&gt; By his life, his word spoke. The works confirm it. When God's light shine, it doesn't just break darkness. It draws people in. &gt;&gt; That's right. Just as that star led them across nations to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's his light and he always does it. It reveals, it guides, and it attracts. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So that's how we know that was Jesus was that great light. See even then in Luke 2 and 25 says behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simon Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit and he came by the spirit unto the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law, then took him up into his arms and blessed God, and said, "The Lord now let us my servant depart in peace according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen the salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people, a light to lighten the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the glory of of thy people of Israel. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure that there is many people that was in the temple that morning that wish that Simeon would have prayed that prayer over their child. Hey, come on. &gt;&gt; How many hundreds of children had come into the temples for years and years that Simeon had held had blessed? &gt;&gt; But here's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Here is the one that he has prayed to see before his death. &gt;&gt; And how does he compare him? As a light to lightenth the Gentiles. That's right. &gt;&gt; What is lighten? Light to lighten it is to provide spiritual understanding, illumination to re to reveal to others. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; What is he? He's going to revelate &gt;&gt; the people of Israel. Thank you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In John 1 John 1:5, it says, "Then this message which we have heard of him declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness whatsoever." Darkness at all. Sorry, that was me saying that there is no darkness at all. And if you say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie &gt;&gt; and do not the truth. But if we walk in the light as he is the light, we have fellowship one with another. &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus Christ, his son, cleanses us from all of our sins. &gt;&gt; See, he's that light. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to cleanse you from all of your sins. &gt;&gt; That's him. &gt;&gt; That's the one we've been looking for. &gt;&gt; That's the light. &gt;&gt; That's how we know he's the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. There's not another name that men and blood sh can be baptized but under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and in him is no darkness at all &gt;&gt; at all is in him no darkness &gt;&gt; because he said I am the light &gt;&gt; to the world right &gt;&gt; he went ahead and let's just go and declare this &gt;&gt; I'm him I'm the light &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; that lightth the world and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have light of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing that he did with the woman at the well. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're in Samaria, one of the cities that even the Jews and even the Gentiles, they didn't really even want to go back and forth. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Even the disciples, Peter and all of them, they would rather have went across Jordan up into Galilee and stay away from Samaria, &gt;&gt; the Samaritan woman, woman at the well. But he says, "I have needs to go by." Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He had needs to go by her way because he was the light to her that day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When she sat there and she began to pour and he said, "Give me to drink." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Says, "Sir, you have not a cup and the wa well was deep." &gt;&gt; He said, "You're right. But if you would ask me of a drink, &gt;&gt; there it is. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; You'd thirst no more." &gt;&gt; That's right. See, he was beginning to reveal who he was. &gt;&gt; Then she became religious with him. &gt;&gt; She became religious with him. She said, "Well, we can't worship here because worship is in Jerusalem. Worship is in the temples." &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what? But there's going to come a time &gt;&gt; that you neither worship in this mountain nor Jerusalem, but you'll worship everywhere. &gt;&gt; You're going to worship like true worshippers will. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then he be to explain and tell her everything because see the light was now shining in her dark places. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that effect of him &gt;&gt; was starting to shine through. &gt;&gt; He said, "I believe I perceive you are a prophet." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says, "I am he &gt;&gt; that they foretold about. &gt;&gt; I'm that one." &gt;&gt; Hey, let me tell you what. When that come revelation to her, she dropped her water pot. She began to reay back and she began to testify of that great light of what he had just done. He had revealed the hearts and secret of her. And that's the same thing in today. God is manifesting the hearts and secret of the people. It's opening up the word of revelation to each and every one of us in this dark age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John Wesley's notes on 8, John 8:12, he says, "He that followeth me shall in no wise walk in darkness." &gt;&gt; He says, "In ignorance, in wickedness, in misery, darkness is misery, ignorance, all of these things, &gt;&gt; but shall have light of life. He that closely, humbly, steadily follows me, &gt;&gt; there it is, &gt;&gt; shall have divine light continually shining upon him, diffusing over his soul knowledge, &gt;&gt; holiness, joy, &gt;&gt; till he has got it by the everlasting life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. This was John Wesley's notes &gt;&gt; on that because that light will produce life. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can go into the darkest depths of the sea where it's so dark. There is life down there, but because it is so dark, it begins to create creatures that look so monstrously horrible. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's what darkness produces. &gt;&gt; Oh my &gt;&gt; monsters. Things that really don't look like they should. &gt;&gt; That's right. It's good. It's good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when &gt;&gt; you're closer to that natural light, things start to appear as they should. &gt;&gt; Fish begin to look like they should. &gt;&gt; Deer begin to feast upon the acorns that the tree has now buted forth and it has produced because of that natural light. That's right. see that that natural light will do things throughout the year. Now, I'm no gardener, but I would guarantee that if I begin to plant corn right now that people would laugh at me. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Because the season of the light has changed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If I go out and I started planting green beans and and other things, am I right in saying that that right now is not a good time? That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I said, I'm no gardener, but I I'm pretty sure of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that natural light, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; is at that point to where it's harvest time. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's already did the process in summer. &gt;&gt; Towards the ending of summer. Now we're in September and we're getting harvest. You're seeing the great combines come by. Right? &gt;&gt; You're seeing all of those things that that you had planted things had been planted back in spring. &gt;&gt; Now they're at full manifestation of what that natural light did. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's the same thing with the S O N. &gt;&gt; That's right. There you go. &gt;&gt; Make sure I get that right. The same thing with the S O N is when he starts to shine on you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And when you begin to just feel that power, &gt;&gt; you begin to feel that growth. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you're alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're full of life. &gt;&gt; Because he's life. &gt;&gt; He gave you life. &gt;&gt; It has a transforming power within it. That's the biggest evidence of it. Light changes things. Wherever Jesus is received, darkness, sin, confusion, fear is gone. And people's lives are radically transformed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You may be sitting here this evening and say, "Well, how do I shine light?" &gt;&gt; That's a genuine question. Well, h how do I shine light? &gt;&gt; I know Jesus is that light, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They testified of it. But now, how do I shine light? &gt;&gt; How do I become light? &gt;&gt; Well, Jesus told you you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said you are the light of the world. a city that is set up on a hill that cannot be healed. &gt;&gt; Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, &gt;&gt; but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine, &gt;&gt; before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You're the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look over each neighbor. Say, "I'm a light." &gt;&gt; I'm a light. And how do I know that? Because Jesus told me I'm a light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm just doing what Jesus told me I was to do. &gt;&gt; And I accepted that. &gt;&gt; I am that light. &gt;&gt; See, and if we walk in darkness, we're not that light. &gt;&gt; You can't reflect him if you're refusing that light. &gt;&gt; And to refuse light is to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what your prophet said. To refuse light is to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; To refuse the light of your day &gt;&gt; is to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There was many that sat there and they and even in today they want to accept John Wesley. They want to accept Lofer's age, but they want to walk in the light of the past. But let me just say that light's gone out. &gt;&gt; That light is gone out. And to refuse the new light that Jesus has provided that we have a profit of that's given us this. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To refuse this is to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; To refuse light is to walk in darkness. &gt;&gt; What is light? It's revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Revelation unto you. &gt;&gt; See, you are a reflection of him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As the moon is a reflection of the sun, &gt;&gt; you are a reflection of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You live differently. &gt;&gt; You love, forgive. &gt;&gt; You remain faithful when others apart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You do good works. You resist the darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You resist. &gt;&gt; Resist the darkness. &gt;&gt; That's what light does. &gt;&gt; Resist it. &gt;&gt; You stay close to that light. Well, how do I stay close to him? Read your Bible. &gt;&gt; Pray. &gt;&gt; Worship. &gt;&gt; He gave it all right here. &gt;&gt; He gave it all in his word. How do I reflect him? &gt;&gt; Right there. &gt;&gt; Start reading psalms. &gt;&gt; Start giving him worship. Start singing songs. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee your atmosphere will change because of light bringing life into your day. &gt;&gt; So you shine light. You do good works. You speak truth and you expose the darkness. See, God gave you this light to shine. You know, it's kind of like going to the doctor and the doctor's asking you a certain question and and and he begins to ask you certain things and then maybe your wife or somebody that took you starts beginning to answer. &gt;&gt; How you how you feel, sir? And she speaks up. He's not doing good at all. He's not doing good. And he's sitting there going, "I I feel fine. I don't even know why I have this appointment." &gt;&gt; Well, you see, he's got this he's got this issue in his heart. And I'm like, "You you need to be quiet over there. See, the doctor is asking him." &gt;&gt; And the same thing with shining someone else's light. &gt;&gt; Come on, preach, buddy. &gt;&gt; Now, there was people that would love to shine your light. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan is a great singer, great worshipper, &gt;&gt; and there is other people that would want to shine Nathan's light. &gt;&gt; Oh, Nathan, you ought to sing like this. Nathan, you ought to sing this song. &gt;&gt; Nathan is shining his light. &gt;&gt; There's people that want to shine your light, but they can't even control their light. They can't control their own life or their light. &gt;&gt; You know, it's kind of like shining a bright light in your face. Sister Cassie, she bought me a spotlight the other day cuz we needed one at our house. Not for hunting. Praise the Lord. Because I have new life. So, she went to Home Depot or Lowe's and and she grabbed this spotlight and and she was telling me about it while I'm on the phone and and she did something. She hit the trigger of that light and she didn't realize it was fully charged. And so, for several minutes, she saw spots because it was so bright and so close that now she's seeing spots. She's seeing darkness because of how bright it was. &gt;&gt; And that is how you need to be prepared to not do to someone that's an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; Because your light is so bright &gt;&gt; and you're wanting to shine it so powerful, &gt;&gt; they're not going to see it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They're only going to see spots. They're going to continue to see dark things. And it's like, &gt;&gt; don't you see it? He's the prophet. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; They &gt;&gt; they didn't see it. &gt;&gt; They don't see it. &gt;&gt; So, you have to guide them. &gt;&gt; You have to shine light unto their pathway. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Benjamin Franklin, he would uh he would think he had light. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would fly that kite and put that bottle on there maybe with that key is what they say and he's flying that kite and all of a sudden lightning strikes that that light that bottle and that key and he's got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. See, he didn't know what he had. &gt;&gt; He had something but he didn't know what he had. That's &gt;&gt; right. Come on now. But it took people like Edison, &gt;&gt; Albert Einstein, &gt;&gt; and other ones to create energy &gt;&gt; which is harnessing that light. &gt;&gt; Harnessing that power. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And we thank God for it here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We thank God for a man that can turn on the light. &gt;&gt; Brother Alen, we thank God for him. &gt;&gt; He knows how to harness that power. I do not. If I'm your electrician, you're going to get water coming out of that electric spout. I'm sorry. I'm not that. I'm a demolition guy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But see, it's a harnessing of that power. And that's the same thing that we have today. There's many people screaming, "They got it. They got it. They got it." &gt;&gt; But they don't have a clue what they got. &gt;&gt; I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. You might feel your hand. You might feel a sweep, a air conditioned through the building. Oh, I felt it. What was that? What? But do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Do you believe what the light is providing? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, there are many people saying, "I got it." But what do you got? &gt;&gt; Ben Franklin was doing the same thing. What do you got? Brother Brandon would say this in El Shetty. I said Jes Jesus never did say did I feel did you feel it he said did you believe it see &gt;&gt; not did you feel it do you believe it faith is not feeling faith is something that you don't feel you have no senses will declare it only that six sense that faith that knows it you don't feel taste smell or hear it but you know it &gt;&gt; because Jesus said so That settles it &gt;&gt; because he said so that settles it. And if I could ever get the message sometime that would shake the people away from all of this Hollywood evangelism and get them down to the Bible to thus sayaith the Lord. Then something would happen. It would be more than I got it. I got it. They'd have it. &gt;&gt; They truly have it. See, it's revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd like to read a little bit from the uh seven church ages here if you bear with me. This is revelation that Jesus Christ had given to the scribes. And it says in Revelations 1 1 and three says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. He sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, of all things that had that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that bear the words of his prophecy hear sorry, hear the words of his prophecy, and keep those things which are written. See what is what is revelation? The Greek word revelation is apocalypse. It's an unveiling. It's an uncovering. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So revelation is the person of Jesus Christ. But it has to be revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages. See all revelation it is tremendously important to the church. &gt;&gt; Right? See in Matthew 16 it says, "Whom do men say that I, the son of man, am?" And they said, "Some say that thou are John the Baptist? Some say Elijah, and others Jeremiah, and one of the other one of the prophets, and he saith unto him, but whom do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven." What is that? Revelation. &gt;&gt; It was revelation that struck his heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I say unto thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. See, God can't build his church upon any man born in sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you can't build the church up on Peter. &gt;&gt; Can't build it on Peter. Peter, &gt;&gt; it wasn't some rock that was laying there &gt;&gt; as though God had hallowed out the ground in that spot. It isn't the protest. It isn't, as the Protestants would say, the church is built upon Jesus. It was revelation. &gt;&gt; Read it. Revealed, &gt;&gt; right? hath revealed it. And upon this rock of revelation, I will build my church. &gt;&gt; The rock, &gt;&gt; the church is built upon revelation. &gt;&gt; That's the effect of the light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The effect of the light will bring revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How do you know? How did Abel know to sacrifice to God faith? He received the revelation of the blood and Cain didn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, he had that same chance. Now, I don't want to get on tomorrow's sermon. So, he had that same chance of revelation. &gt;&gt; But it was revelation to Simon, to Peter that said, "Upon this rock, &gt;&gt; I will build my church." Upon revelation, see, it's a reflection of that great light. See, when you start to begin to reflect God's light, &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on. what you truly are and what he truly is. &gt;&gt; I love Psalms 27. It says, "The Lord is my light &gt;&gt; and my salvation. &gt;&gt; Whom shall I fear? &gt;&gt; The Lord is my strength. Whom shall I be afraid?" &gt;&gt; See, if he is your light, who's there to be scared of? &gt;&gt; If he is your light, &gt;&gt; there's no reason to be scared. The Lord is my life and my strength. Whom shall I be afraid? &gt;&gt; See, there's nothing in this dark age that you can be afraid of &gt;&gt; if you truly accept him, the revelation of this hour, Jesus Christ, there's nothing to be scared of. That's right. &gt;&gt; When you're accepting into him, received his water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, you're walking in that light of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me move on. I'm going to be too too lengthy and I don't want to pull a last weekend here. Brother Joe ending for the next 30 minutes. You know, I love him. He's my buddy. So, I can say this kind of stuff. It's here in Revelations 1 12-20. And let's get on down here. Says, "Fear not. I am the first and I am the last. I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold, I am alive forever more. Amen. And hath the keys of hell and of death. Write these things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter, the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in the right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. &gt;&gt; Do we understand that? The seven stars are the angel of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. &gt;&gt; So let's just go down through here quickly. The seven church age messengers. See, you would have the Apostle Paul, the Ephesians church age. You have Arinius, the Samrian's church age. You have Martin, the Pergamin church age. Columba of Ireland, the thy f thytherian. &gt;&gt; That's &gt;&gt; there you go. Martin Luther &gt;&gt; Sardisian John Wesley the Philadelphiaian church and William Brham Leodysian church. &gt;&gt; Seven stars, &gt;&gt; seven churches, &gt;&gt; seven church age messengers, &gt;&gt; a messenger to each age. And as I was saying earlier, those light to each age, &gt;&gt; but we're not walking in Paul's light. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Or we are going to stay in Ireius &gt;&gt; or Martin Luther, justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. See, if you stay in each one of those, you refuse light. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say it like this. Paul was the first messenger. And I'm sorry I'm so ready, but bear with me. first messenger. And he said to the Galatians in 1:8, he said, "And if any angel, any messenger, any viker, no matter who he is, if he preacheth any other gospel than what Paul preached, let him be accursed." &gt;&gt; Paul knew that after he was after he was gone, grievous wolves would come in. He knew that Satan himself could appear as an angel of that light. So, so how much more his ministry? So, he warns that this gospel would always be the same. Now, Paul had baptized in the na in Jesus' name and rebaptized uh and rebaptized where people had been had not been immersed. and he set the church in order and taught the proper you proper use of the gifts of the spirit to confirm that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came. I'm going to reread that. And he set the church in order and he taught the proper use of the gifts of the spirit and to confirm that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To remain in the church till Jesus came. All right. &gt;&gt; He never took that light away from you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He never took any of that away from you. What Jesus did, you can do. &gt;&gt; He never took that away. He said, "I'm going to give that to the little bit just I'm going to give them to him for a No, he didn't." He said, "Until Jesus came." Thus the next messenger and all remaining six would by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire and give that same light of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the signs would follow them. Did Ireus qualify? Yes, he did. Did Martin qualify? Yes. Did Columba? Yes. Did Martin Luther? And most assuredly did Wesley. And now he didn't put his name here, but I'm going to say it. Did Brother Brandham. We can say yes. &gt;&gt; And he had a great ministry and even prayed for for his horse. I'm sorry. This he was speaking about Wesley at this point did and prayed for his horse and to get well and it did. And there you are. Seven church ages, seven messengers who were alike. Paul pronounced a curse on anyone who said they was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; See, if anyone comes speaking anything other than this word right here, &gt;&gt; let them be accursed. &gt;&gt; See, they were a light to each and every age, a light to walk in. &gt;&gt; You are a light. You are a representation. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, Abraham, they would say, he would say, God would say, "Number the sands on the sea." You can't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But he said, "When you number the stars in the sky, that's you. That's me." &gt;&gt; He's calling out a gentile bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're a reflection of Jesus Christ. And this day, you are those stars. When Abraham looked up to the stars of the sky, he seen you. &gt;&gt; He couldn't number you. He didn't know how far you'd come, how many nations you come from, how far you'd come to be drawn to this light. &gt;&gt; But he said, "You are the light. &gt;&gt; You are the light to this last age." Amen. &gt;&gt; See, for some yet we did sometimes we did walk in darkness, but now you are the light of the Lord. Walk as children of the light. Let's stand at this time. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, who will you show light to? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, don't be like a spotlight and blind people with this message. &gt;&gt; You got them. You live like Jesus lived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You bring a revelation. &gt;&gt; There's a message. There's a word of the Lord. You shine this light. &gt;&gt; See, I'm going to a city. I'm going to a promised land. There shall be no night there and no need of candle, neither light of the sun. For the Lord God giveth &gt;&gt; them light. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where we're heading. &gt;&gt; Each and every one of us. &gt;&gt; We're heading for that city where he is the light of the world. &gt;&gt; We'll worship him forever. We will not be in darkness. There'll be no darkness there. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's that light. Let's &gt;&gt; just bow our heads this evening. Dear heavenly father, Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for this evening. We thank you for this revealed word in this last day, God. A calling out of a bride, a gentile bride. Lord, we can all say this evening that we were in darkness. [Music] Our lives were so decrepit, so unshapely formed. &gt;&gt; Lord, we was in dark places.

Lord, here at Full Gospel Lighthouse Tabernacle, we are a lighthouse on a hill, shining men, ladies to you, [Music] Lord. We don't want to be a reflection or a glare. We want to be the light, Lord, shining until you come. Now God, I ask you that you'll just continue to make this word manifested in each and every one of our hearts tonight, God. God, if there be somebody under the sound of my voice that says, "I'm walking in darkness and I want a way out." You can walk in the light this evening because he's here. You could just raise your hands and say, "God, I thank you. Lord, you've lifted the burdens of our life off of us. You've shown us what we can be to grow in you, God. Oh Lord, we thank you. Just bless these people. Bless this word the bride Lord as our pastor would speak tomorrow for the memorial brother Ed Biscll's memorial there God strengthen him touch his body renew him God Lord as the little bride there is they would shine their light God Lord we thank you for them and what they mean to us Lord if we could just say it We love him with all of our hearts.
