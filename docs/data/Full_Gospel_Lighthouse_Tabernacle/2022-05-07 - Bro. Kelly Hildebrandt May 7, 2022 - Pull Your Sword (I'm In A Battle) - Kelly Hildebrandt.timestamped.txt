[51:51] good evening
[51:54] god bless you
[51:55] it's so good to be back in virginia
[52:00] this is a
[52:02] it feels like a miracle for sister myra
[52:04] and myself to be here it's about two and
[52:06] a half years ago
[52:08] that we were here december of 2019
[52:12] and it was an incredible journey to get
[52:15] here in itself
[52:16] took us three days and
[52:18] but we did arrive and and we did speak
[52:21] and we thanked the lord for him
[52:23] with all of the pandemic and everything
[52:25] that was happening back home i didn't
[52:27] know if we would ever actually be able
[52:28] to leave our own country again
[52:31] but everything settled itself down and
[52:34] and i say here we are
[52:36] i have to say this time sister admired
[52:38] myself when we were traveling
[52:40] it was the best trip that we've ever had
[52:43] this is our first trip since we were
[52:45] here so we we came here and now we're
[52:47] back again
[52:49] we haven't flown since that time i was
[52:51] kind of wondering should i get back on
[52:52] airplane i don't like it when motors
[52:54] start to smoke and things
[52:57] that's not something i actually really
[52:59] appreciate
[53:00] i really thought we were going to crash
[53:03] but they got us back to the airport in
[53:05] calgary and then we made our journey but
[53:07] this particular time
[53:09] we never had one hiccup
[53:12] the flights were all on time the planes
[53:14] were full
[53:16] uh and we met every connection we had no
[53:19] issues with customs we had no issues
[53:21] with security
[53:23] everything was 100
[53:25] and we arrived in richmond virginia
[53:27] virginia
[53:28] and here we are in your beautiful
[53:29] shenandoah valley and we certainly do
[53:32] appreciate every one of your prayers
[53:35] that you prayed for us on our journey
[53:37] here this year
[53:38] thank you very much from sister meyer
[53:40] myself god bless you
[53:43] as brother andrew just mentioned
[53:46] that particular time brother ron
[53:48] ministered that saturday night on a
[53:50] message don't worry
[53:52] and on that sunday afternoon
[53:55] i brought that commemorative coin with
[53:57] me
[53:57] and i presented it to brother ron and on
[53:59] that particular coin it says a full
[54:02] victory
[54:03] we don't we as christians we don't have
[54:05] to worry about will we win
[54:10] you have already won
[54:12] it's already a promise in the word of
[54:14] god
[54:16] amen we may go through battles and we
[54:18] may go through struggles and we may go
[54:20] through different things and brother ron
[54:21] was set to go through an incredible
[54:23] journey
[54:24] but he's still here today
[54:26] and we still believe the testimony to
[54:28] true is true
[54:30] that god is his healer
[54:33] amen he's been a great encouragement to
[54:35] us his fortitude and and and just his
[54:38] desire to keep pressing the battle and
[54:41] every time he ministers it gives us a
[54:43] real hope of what god is doing in the
[54:45] bride of the lord jesus christ today my
[54:47] question is is that if we do believe
[54:52] and we've been given the word of god in
[54:54] this hour why would we want to retract
[54:56] on the word of god
[54:59] we may have ten thousand demons in front
[55:01] of us but what's ten thousand demons to
[55:03] a son of god who's filled with the holy
[55:05] ghost
[55:06] it's only demons
[55:09] demons are something you put under your
[55:10] feet
[55:11] that's not something you have to concern
[55:13] yourself with it's something that you
[55:15] already are the victor over
[55:17] because jesus christ defeated it i like
[55:20] him to hear it every day when i speak
[55:22] jesus defeated you satan on calvary you
[55:25] have no right to hold the people of
[55:27] almighty god
[55:29] he's almighty god
[55:31] i'm glad we're on his side
[55:34] amen
[55:36] i'd like to also thank the the fraser
[55:39] family for allowing us to be at their
[55:41] children's wedding it was such a
[55:43] beautiful event and
[55:45] god bless you and trust that um brother
[55:48] zachary and sister mayor they made it to
[55:50] their safe destination
[55:52] you know when we got married we drove
[55:54] 100 miles to go to our honeymoon spot
[55:59] we didn't take a trip halfway around the
[56:01] world to do it
[56:05] but i mentioned to brother wrong but we
[56:06] couldn't afford to fill up our tank back
[56:08] then either
[56:10] gas was only about a 50 70 cents a
[56:13] gallon but
[56:15] it was just a wonderful time that we
[56:17] shared together with them and
[56:19] what a beautiful couple they are
[56:22] amen
[56:24] sure love to sit down and talk with
[56:25] every one of you two sometime and it
[56:27] gave us an opportunity to do that at the
[56:29] wedding but sometime some glorious day
[56:32] what a grand time it's going to be
[56:35] since we were here last as well my
[56:36] understanding is there's certain ones
[56:38] that have gone on to be with the lord
[56:40] and we give our sincere condolences to
[56:42] each and every one of you may the lord
[56:44] be with you
[56:46] and we have a hope and a promise that
[56:48] one day very soon we're going to meet
[56:50] them again
[56:52] amen i'm looking forward to that time
[56:54] is that resurrection mourning the saints
[56:57] of god coming out of the graves and what
[56:58] a grand day it's going to be that's why
[57:00] we're here tonight
[57:02] is to be able to give him honor and
[57:04] glory and to prepare ourselves for that
[57:06] great event
[57:08] amen on that particular time
[57:10] our little country church back home they
[57:12] send their greetings to every each and
[57:14] every one of you sister kay and
[57:17] my brother kenton and sister lorraine

[57:57] turn a certain age and i let them know
[57:59] that they can travel with me to some
[58:01] destination

[58:04] overseas or take them to a different
[58:06] place

[58:09] where he wants to go
[58:11] right here
[58:13] right here in virginia
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:22] when i when i when he heard i was coming
[58:24] here the first question that he said to
[58:26] me said
[58:27] grandpa can i come with you
[58:29] i said not this trip but the next trip
[58:31] we come we'll bring you along
[58:33] amen isn't that special
[58:35] he sure thinks highly of you all and
[58:37] that's this is where he wants to come is
[58:39] right here
[58:40] amen if you have your bibles today i'd
[58:42] like to read second corinthians chapter
[58:44] 6 verse 7 and 10.
[58:47] the lord's been good to us he's kept us
[58:49] all these months and days
[58:52] amen
[58:54] appreciate the atmosphere that's here
[58:56] tonight
[58:57] god bless you
[59:00] second corinthians and paul is speaking
[59:02] here to the corinthian church
[59:04] and
[59:05] he uses these words by the word of truth
[59:09] we could say that that is something that
[59:11] we are a possessor of
[59:13] out of all the generations of time
[59:16] we've been the ones in this generation
[59:18] to be given all the truth
[59:21] amen not a partial gospel but the whole
[59:24] of the gospel
[59:25] it says by the word of truth by the
[59:27] power of god
[59:29] which is the dunamis of god
[59:31] by the armor of righteousness on the
[59:33] right hand
[59:35] and on the left
[59:37] by honor and dishonor by evil reporting
[59:39] good report as deceivers and yet true as
[59:42] unknown and yet well known as dying and
[59:44] behold we live as chastened and not
[59:47] killed as sorrowful
[59:49] yet always let's say always tonight
[59:52] i say it one more time always
[59:54] yet always rejoicing
[59:57] as poor
[59:58] yet making many rich
[1:00:01] as having nothing
[1:00:03] and yet
[1:00:05] possessing
[1:00:06] all things
[1:00:08] amen god bless you you may have your
[1:00:10] seats tonight
[1:00:13] look at your neighbor and on the left
[1:00:16] and then your neighbor on the right and
[1:00:17] tell them
[1:00:18] every promise of god is mine
[1:00:25] tell the ones behind you the same and
[1:00:26] the ones in front of you the same
[1:00:28] every promise
[1:00:30] of god is mine
[1:00:34] now what you've just done is you've just
[1:00:36] confessed with your own lips
[1:00:38] that every promise that's in the word of
[1:00:40] god belongs to you personally
[1:00:43] you you can look at your neighbor and
[1:00:45] you say well it's only for him or it's
[1:00:47] only for her it's only for the pastor or
[1:00:49] maybe the deacons but no every promise
[1:00:53] in the word of god belongs to you
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:58] i'd like to my title tonight if i would
[1:01:00] give it a title would be pull your sword
[1:01:04] pull your sword
[1:01:06] and my subtitle would be i'm in a battle
[1:01:10] we're all in a battle
[1:01:12] it doesn't matter what we're
[1:01:14] what we're we're going through things
[1:01:16] but we're all in a battle
[1:01:19] we need to learn how to pull our sword
[1:01:22] and fight with all this within our heart
[1:01:25] i brought a commemorated coin uh with me
[1:01:28] the last time as i mentioned we were
[1:01:29] here that i said we'll
[1:01:31] accept nothing but full victory
[1:01:34] and i prayed and i felt if the lord
[1:01:36] would bring me back to virginia one time
[1:01:38] one more time
[1:01:40] there was something i was going to
[1:01:41] actually bring
[1:01:43] here for brother ron spencer today
[1:01:46] and today i'd like to
[1:01:48] to present this to brother ron and it's
[1:01:51] a
[1:01:53] little statue
[1:01:56] and this particular statue is
[1:01:59] is david
[1:02:07] it's david
[1:02:08] and right over here
[1:02:11] is an enemy
[1:02:13] and his foot's on the enemy
[1:02:18] he's got a sword
[1:02:24] it's just one thing to have full victory
[1:02:27] but it's another thing when your enemy
[1:02:29] is dead
[1:02:31] and i i i put a name on the statue your
[1:02:36] enemy is dead brother one
[1:03:09] [Applause]
[1:03:16] i'm sorry
[1:03:21] gotta get it right
[1:03:42] all right
[1:03:53] you can be seated
[1:03:55] i've never interrupted a speaker but i'm
[1:03:57] going to now
[1:04:00] i've carried that coin
[1:04:01] all over the world
[1:04:05] i don't know how i'm going to carry that
[1:04:10] for those that know statue is a perfect
[1:04:13] gift
[1:04:17] i i'm not going to interrupt but about
[1:04:18] 30 seconds how many remember the
[1:04:22] vision of brother branham
[1:04:25] as he was speaking
[1:04:27] and he had a certain jacket on
[1:04:34] well i have great expectations
[1:04:37] because kelly's wearing that jacket
[1:04:38] tonight
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:52] [Applause]
[1:05:05] special for us to bring that here
[1:05:09] because we believe your enemy's dead
[1:05:13] doctors may have one report but there's
[1:05:15] another report
[1:05:20] hallelujah
[1:05:22] the lord is good to us
[1:05:25] if you have your bibles as well i'd also
[1:05:27] like to read genesis chapter 12 verse 7.
[1:05:34] excuse me for my emotion
[1:05:41] and the lord appeared unto abraham and
[1:05:43] said unto thy seed will i give this land
[1:05:46] and there built he an altar unto the
[1:05:48] lord who appeared unto him
[1:05:50] in genesis 13 which is just across the
[1:05:53] page genesis 13 14 to 17
[1:05:57] and the bible says and the lord said
[1:05:58] unto abraham after the lot was separated
[1:06:01] from him lift up now thine eyes and look
[1:06:03] from the place where thou art
[1:06:05] northward southward eastward and
[1:06:07] westward
[1:06:08] for all the lamb which i'll see is to
[1:06:10] thee will i give it
[1:06:11] and to thy seed forever
[1:06:14] and i will make thy seed as the dust of
[1:06:16] the earth so that if a man can number
[1:06:17] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[1:06:20] seed also be numbered arise let's say
[1:06:22] arise tonight
[1:06:24] arise and walk arise is a forward motion
[1:06:27] amen you're not supposed to sit down and
[1:06:30] just let the world go by but we have
[1:06:31] something to do in this hour and the
[1:06:34] bible says arise and walk through the
[1:06:36] land and the length of it and in the
[1:06:37] breath of it for i will give it unto
[1:06:41] thee god bless you you may have your
[1:06:42] seats
[1:06:43] now abraham had come out of out of his
[1:06:46] place
[1:06:47] and he brought with him lot who was was
[1:06:49] his nephew and it came to a place in a
[1:06:52] position in that time where where lots
[1:06:55] herdsmen and abraham's herdsmen were
[1:06:57] having a difficult time with one another
[1:07:00] but everything happens for a purpose and
[1:07:02] for a reason because god was about to
[1:07:04] bring a blessing onto abraham and to his
[1:07:07] seed and there's only one way he could
[1:07:09] do that and that was to actually have a
[1:07:11] separation between lot and abraham
[1:07:15] now you know as well as i know that that
[1:07:18] we can say a lot of words and we may
[1:07:20] have a lot of head knowledge and we may
[1:07:22] may be able to quote the message and
[1:07:23] even quote the scripture verbatimly but
[1:07:26] if there's still something within our
[1:07:28] lives that is not separated from us if
[1:07:31] not all unbelief is out of our lives how
[1:07:33] can god ever bring a real blessing to
[1:07:36] our lives into our hearts
[1:07:38] amen i'm not going to preach anything
[1:07:39] new today but i just want to share my
[1:07:41] heart with you
[1:07:42] i believe that the bride of the lord
[1:07:44] jesus christ must not have one doubt in
[1:07:48] their heart concerning the word of god
[1:07:51] for the word of god is given to us to
[1:07:53] give us life it's given to us to give us
[1:07:56] joy it's given to us to give us peace
[1:07:59] but above all it gives us the fortitude
[1:08:01] that we have need of every day to fight
[1:08:04] the good fight of faith
[1:08:06] amen now it's true there's more demon
[1:08:08] power than there's ever been but there's
[1:08:09] a greater word than we've ever had
[1:08:11] before
[1:08:12] because god will always rise a standard
[1:08:15] against the enemy amen if abraham ham
[1:08:18] had to walk through the breath of it and
[1:08:20] the length of it and the complete part
[1:08:23] how much more does every one of us have
[1:08:25] to take the word of god not just as a
[1:08:28] letter but something that is living
[1:08:30] within our own lives and living with our
[1:08:32] own hearts amen i believe the word of
[1:08:34] god is true
[1:08:37] i believe that every promise in the word
[1:08:39] of god is for every individual
[1:08:42] amen when brother branham says that if
[1:08:43] we take the right mental attitude
[1:08:45] towards the word of god that god will
[1:08:48] actually perform it through our lives i
[1:08:50] believe that with all my heart amen i
[1:08:53] always the people back home say brother
[1:08:54] kelly why do you always look into
[1:08:56] yourself if there's a situation i say
[1:08:58] because i want to be sure that there's
[1:09:00] nothing in my heart that's actually
[1:09:03] blocking or stopping the moving of the
[1:09:05] holy spirit
[1:09:06] amen because the holy spirit wants to
[1:09:09] move in this hour if we can just get
[1:09:11] ourselves out of the way while we know
[1:09:14] in ourselves that the real enemy is a
[1:09:16] lot of times it's just our self when we
[1:09:18] look in the mirror we see who he is amen
[1:09:20] but we all have a word of god and i
[1:09:23] believe that we're moving up it's not
[1:09:25] just any word we have in this hour but
[1:09:27] it's a special word for the bride of
[1:09:29] jesus christ it's a word to get us
[1:09:32] prepared for the rapture

[1:09:37] all i desire that's all i'm waiting for
[1:09:40] that's my whole goal is that they sang
[1:09:43] that song tonight ain't no grave going
[1:09:44] to hold me down that's the song brother
[1:09:46] homer saying a lot the first time we
[1:09:49] came here i never forget that song
[1:09:51] because we can say with the shirts
[1:09:53] that's the assurance tonight we can see
[1:09:55] if the shirts there is no grave going to
[1:09:58] hold this body down amen we believe with
[1:10:02] all of our heart amen if i go to the

[1:10:08] grave again because it's a promise of
[1:10:11] the word of god

[1:10:32] rid of whatever's hindering in you in
[1:10:34] your life and allow the holy spirit to
[1:10:36] take control and start saying what god
[1:10:39] said about you quit saying what the
[1:10:42] devil is putting in your ear amen start
[1:10:44] to have discernment in your life
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] well i don't know why people want to
[1:10:50] sell themselves out that that they don't
[1:10:52] have uh
[1:10:53] that that god's not gonna gonna help
[1:10:56] them i said man he came to save sinners
[1:11:00] amen but he wasn't gonna he was gonna
[1:11:02] change our lives
[1:11:05] amen in the message jehovah jireh it
[1:11:07] says no abraham the promise was made to
[1:11:09] abraham and his seed after him not only
[1:11:12] abraham but his seed now the seed
[1:11:15] natural seed of abraham was isaac but
[1:11:17] the spiritual seed of abraham's faith
[1:11:20] was christ not through isaac all the
[1:11:23] world was blessed but through christ
[1:11:25] let's say christ
[1:11:26] the royal seed all the world was blessed
[1:11:29] for he died for all people all nations
[1:11:33] and all peoples
[1:11:34] amen if i read that i read a prophetic
[1:11:37] word and that means that he died for all
[1:11:40] of us
[1:11:42] now it's up to you to accept him
[1:11:44] it's up to you to say i'm going to pull
[1:11:46] my sword amen but a lot of people their
[1:11:49] swords are so seized in the sheath
[1:11:51] because they haven't had it out for a
[1:11:52] while i say this morning whatever this
[1:11:55] evening whatever you need to do pull
[1:11:57] your sword out amen let's fight this
[1:12:00] good fight of faith let's lay a hold on
[1:12:02] eternal things let's not let the devil
[1:12:05] cow us down but let's show him who the
[1:12:07] boss is in this hour amen we're sons and
[1:12:10] daughters of the living god amen take
[1:12:13] your position church move in the name of
[1:12:16] the lord in the power of the holy spirit
[1:12:19] don't allow the enemy to pull you down
[1:12:22] if sickness is in your way take a hold
[1:12:25] of it if something's in your life then
[1:12:27] get rid of it and put christ in this
[1:12:29] place
[1:12:31] amen we need to take our positions
[1:12:35] amen can you imagine you're getting
[1:12:37] something from the lord and and you're
[1:12:38] not even interested in it
[1:12:41] he says i'm going to give you eternal
[1:12:43] life
[1:12:44] and people want to want to have the
[1:12:46] attitude that's not for them when it's
[1:12:48] for them christ paid the price for you
[1:12:52] amen and if christ paid the price what
[1:12:54] are we concerned about
[1:12:57] amen what are we concerned about
[1:13:00] amen you say well i've got a lot of
[1:13:01] things happening in my life a lot of
[1:13:03] difficult things what are you concerned
[1:13:05] about
[1:13:06] if christ is for you who can be against
[1:13:08] you
[1:13:09] amen you've been given a word of promise
[1:13:11] we've been given a word a promise amen
[1:13:13] brother branham does not did not come
[1:13:16] just to put it in a book form but he
[1:13:18] came that it would become a living life
[1:13:20] within each and every one of our hearts
[1:13:24] somebody say praise the lord
[1:13:27] it says and i see so possess the gates
[1:13:29] of the enemy he said then you say
[1:13:31] brother brown i'm a gentile i could not
[1:13:33] have the seed of abraham the seed of
[1:13:36] abraham wasn't i know you know these
[1:13:38] things but just let bear with me
[1:13:40] the seed of abraham wasn't the natural
[1:13:42] seed it was the spiritual scene
[1:13:45] amen that's who we are
[1:13:47] for the circumcision of that was nothing
[1:13:50] the promise he even gave him
[1:13:52] circumcision but it was given to him
[1:13:54] before circumcision and it wasn't
[1:13:56] because he was circumcised and in the
[1:13:58] covenant with god that way is because
[1:14:00] that abraham let's say abraham
[1:14:04] abraham believe god
[1:14:06] amen i believe we have a lot of
[1:14:08] believers in here this evening hour amen
[1:14:11] a lot of people who believe god who take
[1:14:13] god at his word and move in that word
[1:14:17] and the scripture said when we are dead
[1:14:19] in christ we become abraham's seed paul
[1:14:22] speaks of it and that which is jew is
[1:14:24] not jude overly but you inwardly
[1:14:27] therefore if you are born
[1:14:29] of the spirit of god you are abraham's
[1:14:32] seed and our heirs with abraham
[1:14:34] according to the promise
[1:14:36] see therefore every promise that god
[1:14:39] gave abraham is yours because
[1:14:41] spiritually
[1:14:42] you are
[1:14:43] abraham c
[1:14:49] i love it when i read the promises of
[1:14:50] god
[1:14:53] i take that to my
[1:14:54] heart because god's word is true
[1:14:59] it was god that spoke to abraham and
[1:15:01] said arise and walk
[1:15:03] through the land in the length of it the
[1:15:05] breath of it not for i will give it unto
[1:15:08] you
[1:15:09] we've heard for years that footprints is
[1:15:11] possession
[1:15:12] no doubt you've heard it many times over
[1:15:14] this very pulpit by many different men
[1:15:17] of god
[1:15:18] footprint says possession
[1:15:21] that means wherever you put your feet in
[1:15:23] the word of god it belongs to you
[1:15:26] it becomes a personal part of you
[1:15:29] as you say well what about maybe it's
[1:15:31] just for brother ron no it's for you too
[1:15:34] because it's personal
[1:15:36] the word of god is not vague in the
[1:15:39] sense of a vagueness but the word of god
[1:15:41] speaks personally to each one of us
[1:15:45] and in that when it speaks to us in a
[1:15:47] personal way it's up to us to take all
[1:15:50] the thoughts of doubt that would try to
[1:15:52] hinder our life and we all have them
[1:15:57] and take those thoughts and bring them
[1:15:59] into subjection to the word of god
[1:16:01] amen in order that we can climb higher
[1:16:04] in christ
[1:16:06] i want to climb higher every day
[1:16:09] every service i want to go higher
[1:16:12] my my desire is to get so high in the
[1:16:15] lord until i don't even think about
[1:16:17] myself anymore all i can see is christ
[1:16:19] living through me
[1:16:20] amen i want him to be visible through my
[1:16:23] life
[1:16:24] i want to have the
[1:16:26] the the
[1:16:27] the testimony when people see see me see
[1:16:30] you they say i know that person is a
[1:16:32] real christian i've seen them in the hot
[1:16:34] seat i've seen them under pressure i've
[1:16:36] watched how they reacted and i saw that
[1:16:38] there was really the spirit of the
[1:16:40] living god living down in their heart
[1:16:43] amen i want that to be my testimony i
[1:16:45] trust you want that to be your testimony
[1:16:48] amen that christ has full preeminence in
[1:16:50] each one of our lives
[1:16:52] amen can i have a name
[1:16:54] amen for that
[1:16:55] amen now the word arise in the hebrew it
[1:16:58] means to be void to be proven to be
[1:17:02] fulfilled i mean excuse me not void to
[1:17:04] be valid to be proven to be fulfilled
[1:17:08] in other words god is validating his
[1:17:11] word
[1:17:12] he got a stamp of approval on it
[1:17:15] i want to say his word is all powerful
[1:17:18] amen it doesn't take a big man david
[1:17:21] wasn't a big man he was just a small
[1:17:23] ruddy person but there was something in
[1:17:25] his heart that he knew that god's word
[1:17:28] was true and he also knew that he was
[1:17:30] anointed by the prophet samuel
[1:17:34] amen we're all born by one spirit into
[1:17:36] one body we've been given the same
[1:17:38] anointing esha that god has given in
[1:17:41] each one of our lives and when he came
[1:17:43] into the count that day he wasn't
[1:17:45] concerned about no giants he wasn't
[1:17:48] concerned about nothing but when he
[1:17:49] heard goliath make his big bows it
[1:17:52] didn't matter to him how big he was how
[1:17:55] broad he was how heavy he was when
[1:17:57] anything about him he just said who's
[1:18:00] this uncircumcised philistine
[1:18:02] is defying the armies of the living god
[1:18:05] amen and there was something in his
[1:18:06] heart that says i'm gonna tear him down
[1:18:12] you're going to have something in your
[1:18:14] heart amen to tear them down when the
[1:18:16] devil comes in front of you you're going
[1:18:18] to tear his kingdom down not let him get
[1:18:21] the preeminence in your life but tear it
[1:18:24] down
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:28] he went worried
[1:18:30] goliath had his big bows
[1:18:34] his boats were just vanity to david
[1:18:38] because remember words have power
[1:18:43] and david's his words were a lot more
[1:18:45] assertive
[1:18:47] he thought this is you're sending a
[1:18:49] doggo to me to fight me and david said
[1:18:52] no i come to you underneath the power of
[1:18:55] the living god
[1:18:57] amen i come to you in the name of the
[1:18:59] lord god of israel amen i'm not going to
[1:19:03] fall over your feet but you're going to
[1:19:05] fall before me
[1:19:07] amen and we've said it many times that
[1:19:10] that that david went fearlessly let's
[1:19:13] say fearlessly
[1:19:15] amen he wasn't concerned about him
[1:19:18] we go to the doctor and i'm the same way
[1:19:21] i got situations i deal with and the
[1:19:23] doctor gives us a report immediately
[1:19:25] fear tries to grip ourselves
[1:19:27] david had no fear of that
[1:19:30] amen because he was anointed for his day
[1:19:34] amen what would happen if the bride of
[1:19:37] the lord jesus christ would realize who
[1:19:40] she is and that she is an invincible
[1:19:42] army amen and she would take the word of
[1:19:44] god and start to fight the good fight of
[1:19:47] faith until the devil had absolutely no
[1:19:50] preeminence at all on the bride
[1:19:54] i said this back home and i i think it
[1:19:56] bears repeating i don't know how god is
[1:19:58] going to do it universally but somehow
[1:20:00] we're all going to come to that spot
[1:20:06] can i say that again
[1:20:09] i don't know how god's going to do it
[1:20:11] but somehow we're all going to get to
[1:20:13] the place of maturity at the same time
[1:20:18] because god it's god's program it's not
[1:20:20] our program we're only here to follow
[1:20:23] his word to obey his word and whatever
[1:20:26] comes before us that's not of god to
[1:20:29] tear it down
[1:20:33] david didn't even have his own sword he
[1:20:34] took goliath's own words and cut his
[1:20:36] neck off
[1:20:38] i like what i liked about this statue
[1:20:40] brother ron is that he wasn't dainty
[1:20:42] where he put his foot either
[1:20:47] hey one day to you about it
[1:20:50] he put his foot right where it should be
[1:20:51] right over his mouth
[1:20:56] i know about the devil whispers in your
[1:20:58] ear but i like to put my foot over his
[1:21:00] mouth
[1:21:08] brother branham of blind bartimaeus he
[1:21:09] said sister in that wheelchair on the
[1:21:11] stretcher god promise you healing you'll
[1:21:13] have to fight every inch of it
[1:21:16] the devil will make you fight with the
[1:21:18] sword of god every inch of it but
[1:21:20] remember footsteps is possession
[1:21:23] wheresoever your foot treads that i give
[1:21:27] unto you
[1:21:29] every step you make you know that gets
[1:21:30] me feeling religious i can say that this
[1:21:33] evening as well because footsteps is
[1:21:35] possession
[1:21:37] all the land that your feet will tread
[1:21:39] upon in this promised land it's yours
[1:21:43] amen let's say it's mine
[1:21:45] we're saying yes it's mine oh yes it's
[1:21:47] mine amen every promise god gives
[1:21:50] belongs to the bride of christ amen and
[1:21:53] i would like to say to every believer
[1:21:54] tonight
[1:21:55] any anything that you can take any
[1:21:57] divine promise god claim it hold on to
[1:22:00] it it belongs to you
[1:22:02] i could stand here and testify for for
[1:22:06] for a long time all that god has done in
[1:22:08] our lives and with our family and what
[1:22:10] he's done with the people in our
[1:22:12] assembly miraculous healings amen it's
[1:22:15] not just a one church move it's a
[1:22:17] universal move god is moving all over
[1:22:20] the world amen because people are taking
[1:22:22] them at his word and they're believing
[1:22:24] that word
[1:22:28] now in your walk with the lord there's
[1:22:30] obstacles
[1:22:33] obstacles
[1:22:35] and the dictionary obstacle means
[1:22:37] something that impends progress or
[1:22:39] achievement
[1:22:41] i was looking that up and i
[1:22:43] i found it interesting because they used
[1:22:45] an analogy
[1:22:47] and they say that mosquitoes
[1:22:49] were the greatest obstacle in the
[1:22:52] building of the panama canal
[1:22:59] i thought mosquitoes
[1:23:01] you know how big that thing is
[1:23:04] you guys have them up here too don't you
[1:23:06] are down here i should say
[1:23:08] i thought maybe when we had him in
[1:23:09] canada but
[1:23:12] it's probably one of the creatures that
[1:23:14] that i hate the most
[1:23:18] i've never seen anybody
[1:23:20] feed away
[1:23:25] i've never seen that
[1:23:27] i'll tell you what i've seen i've seen
[1:23:28] in the middle of a night
[1:23:30] you're sitting in a tent or in a house
[1:23:32] or something like that and you hear
[1:23:33] those
[1:23:34] those wonderful music absolutely
[1:23:39] i'll tell you what you wake up
[1:23:41] you say oh that's just a mosquito i'm
[1:23:43] just going to go back to sleep no you
[1:23:45] turn on the light
[1:23:48] and you have one thing to do that's to
[1:23:50] hunt that thing down
[1:23:54] our problem says to admire myself is we
[1:23:56] can't see so we first have to find our
[1:23:58] glasses before we can find out where
[1:24:00] it's at
[1:24:02] it's just a little wee thing
[1:24:05] it's just a mosquito
[1:24:07] i'm glad they're not in the millennium
[1:24:10] i thought i'd get an amen on that one
[1:24:11] but
[1:24:14] i'm glad they're not in the millennium
[1:24:16] are we all glad about that
[1:24:17] well we can agree on something tonight
[1:24:20] no mosquitoes in the millennium
[1:24:23] it's just a small insect
[1:24:27] but i want to just say this possibly
[1:24:29] there could be a small besetting
[1:24:32] situation in your life
[1:24:35] that's causing you a lot of problems
[1:24:39] might not even be very big
[1:24:41] it's hindering you from actually
[1:24:43] accepting and believing all the word of
[1:24:45] god
[1:24:47] it's one thing to say it with your mouth
[1:24:49] but it's another thing to say with your
[1:24:51] heart
[1:24:52] there's a whole difference there
[1:24:55] amen when it's a revelation in your
[1:24:56] heart you can you're standing on the
[1:24:58] rock then
[1:25:00] you you know where you're at
[1:25:02] amen but sometimes there's little things
[1:25:04] that people pick up in life and and and
[1:25:07] i've i've watched this back at home
[1:25:09] we're in the time of maturity it's okay
[1:25:11] if i just take my time
[1:25:13] we're in the time of the bride is in the
[1:25:15] place of maturity let's say maturity
[1:25:19] so the closer we get to maturity the
[1:25:22] seed within our own lives starts to
[1:25:24] manifest itself
[1:25:27] amen it don't matter what the seed is
[1:25:29] it's going to manifest itself you think
[1:25:31] you can hide but sooner or
[1:25:39] that thing with l lot of hearts they
[1:25:41] resist that thing when they should be
[1:25:43] saying oh glory to god praise the lord
[1:25:46] hallelujah i didn't even know that was
[1:25:48] in my life but it's so visible in my
[1:25:50] life night right now i'm going to lay
[1:25:52] that thing down right now i'm going to
[1:25:54] hunt that thing in my soul until that
[1:25:56] thing is completely eradicated within my
[1:25:59] own heart
[1:26:03] david said search my heart
[1:26:06] and when he when he said search my heart
[1:26:09] this his his thought pattern was is i do
[1:26:12] not
[1:26:13] i do not trust my own evaluation of my
[1:26:16] own life
[1:26:18] i need an outside source to check my
[1:26:21] life and check my heart you say brother
[1:26:23] kelly this elementary i'm just bringing
[1:26:25] what the lord put on my heart so you got
[1:26:27] to take it up with a boss
[1:26:29] amen and and so and we we sometimes we
[1:26:33] there's something so far hidden in our
[1:26:34] heart also just like that it's there
[1:26:39] and david said

[1:27:08] pews as it were thanking god for coming
[1:27:10] by your way to bring deliverance in your

[1:27:39] confidence in the word of god that god's
[1:27:42] word is true and his word will never
[1:27:45] fail
[1:27:47] somebody say praise the lord amen it's
[1:27:49] time to rise and shine for the glory of
[1:27:53] the lord has come upon this bride in
[1:27:55] this hour
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:27:58] it's not time to retract
[1:28:00] he said arise
[1:28:03] and walk
[1:28:05] it's a it's a positive thing it's
[1:28:07] something that moves us in a propelling
[1:28:09] place we're moving forward in the word
[1:28:12] of the lord we're not moving backwards
[1:28:15] no it's like when when when moses came
[1:28:17] to the red sea and when he came to the
[1:28:19] sea god had brought him there for a
[1:28:22] reason
[1:28:24] because he knew that if they would see
[1:28:26] war they want to go back to egypt but
[1:28:28] here they were locked in and god was
[1:28:31] about to show them the glory of the lord
[1:28:34] hallelujah
[1:28:36] they had a pillar of fire by day and and
[1:28:39] a cloud by day and a pill or fire by
[1:28:41] night amen that god was with the people
[1:28:43] and he said to moses why are you crying
[1:28:46] unto me speak the word and bring this
[1:28:49] people forward they didn't tell them to
[1:28:51] go back to egypt they told them to go
[1:28:54] forward to canaanland to the land of
[1:28:56] promise the land that was given to
[1:28:59] abraham their father he said it's your
[1:29:01] land i've given it to you
[1:29:05] and to this day it's still their land
[1:29:08] amen we're we're not just under right
[1:29:10] now
[1:29:10] underneath just a luther's message or a
[1:29:13] wesleyan message we're not underneath
[1:29:16] even the outpouring of the of the gifts
[1:29:18] of 1906 but we have the full word of god
[1:29:21] today now we don't do away with this but
[1:29:23] we take it and we
[1:29:25] and we accept it in our lives and you
[1:29:27] allow the gifts of god to move
[1:29:30] i'm going to stop here for one moment
[1:29:33] what i find unfortunately is people
[1:29:36] wants to go back to what they had
[1:29:39] they don't want to go forward into what
[1:29:41] god has for them
[1:29:43] hey man i've heard of the statement many
[1:29:45] years ago that god has put the
[1:29:48] gifts on the shelf as it were and and
[1:29:50] what they what they have now is nothing
[1:29:52] but a a bunch of dead churches a bunch
[1:29:56] of dead people
[1:29:57] people that don't know how to worship
[1:29:59] people don't know how to praise the lord
[1:30:02] people that don't know how to get in the
[1:30:04] spirit and they just got nothing but
[1:30:06] dead
[1:30:07] dead churches
[1:30:09] i want to say they're double dead i know
[1:30:12] who's listened tonight but they're
[1:30:14] plucked up by the root amen they're dead
[1:30:18] i have to be honest i always say the
[1:30:20] spirit of god needs a liberty to move in
[1:30:23] the house of god the spirit of god has
[1:30:25] the liberty to move in each and every
[1:30:27] one of our hearts
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:32] people say oh it's going to get out of
[1:30:34] control
[1:30:35] oh i said brother brown said the spirit
[1:30:37] of god never gets out of
[1:30:39] he's a gentleman
[1:30:41] hey man people are afraid to dance in
[1:30:43] the spirit
[1:30:45] hope it's okay
[1:30:47] people are afraid to get excited in the
[1:30:49] house of god
[1:30:50] i've had people sit in church and they
[1:30:53] looks like they're so
[1:30:54] so i don't know if they're happy or not
[1:30:57] but i know they're happy when they get
[1:30:59] out of church because they can smile
[1:31:02] i say if you can smile out of church you
[1:31:04] can smile in church
[1:31:05] if you get happy about a bold game out
[1:31:07] of church you get happy inside of the
[1:31:10] host of the lord when god is moving
[1:31:12] amongst the people amen rise and shine
[1:31:15] church
[1:31:19] give him glory give him praise he's a
[1:31:22] living god he wants to do exploits
[1:31:24] amongst the people amen he wants to
[1:31:27] deliver his people i say let's go
[1:31:30] forward in the power of god
[1:31:34] i'm not going backwards to egypt i'm not
[1:31:36] going backwards to the things of the
[1:31:38] world i'm going forward to our promised
[1:31:41] land
[1:31:43] i'm promised a new body
[1:31:48] one day i'm gonna step into that body
[1:31:51] no matter what the obstacles are i'm
[1:31:53] going forward
[1:31:55] amen anything that's hindering me i'm
[1:31:57] laying it down at the altar
[1:31:59] amen i believe the word of god
[1:32:02] we have a right to claim every promise
[1:32:04] that god has given us
[1:32:06] amen
[1:32:08] well you're gonna have to fight for it
[1:32:11] got to fight for it
[1:32:13] we all got to fight for it
[1:32:15] but he's already promised victory
[1:32:18] let's say victory
[1:32:20] say victory is mine
[1:32:22] amen that belongs to you
[1:32:25] amen don't let the devil take it from
[1:32:27] you
[1:32:29] victory is ours
[1:32:33] as you get to the more to place the
[1:32:34] maturity those seeds
[1:32:36] in our hearts they start to manifest
[1:32:38] themselves more
[1:32:40] now we've got two options
[1:32:42] get right with god lay it down
[1:32:45] or become prideful
[1:32:48] and belligerent about it
[1:32:50] is that okay
[1:32:53] i'm going to read second corinthians
[1:32:54] chapter 10 verses 3 to 5.
[1:32:57] i'm going to read it in the king james
[1:32:59] version that i want to read in the
[1:33:00] passion translation
[1:33:02] for though we walk in the flesh
[1:33:05] we're not war after the flesh
[1:33:08] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:33:09] carnal but mighty through god to the
[1:33:11] pulling town of strongholds
[1:33:13] casting down let's say casting down
[1:33:16] that means you take it and you throw it
[1:33:18] down
[1:33:19] and when you throw it down that means
[1:33:21] it's down
[1:33:22] amen and every high thing
[1:33:25] that exalted this self against the
[1:33:27] knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:33:30] captivity
[1:33:31] every thought
[1:33:33] to the obedience of christ now paul is
[1:33:36] giving us the key
[1:33:38] to have victory in our lives
[1:33:41] it's up to us to law unlocking
[1:33:43] and the passion translation that says
[1:33:46] for although we live in the natural
[1:33:48] realm we don't war a military campaign
[1:33:52] employing human weapons using
[1:33:54] manipulation to achieve our aims
[1:33:57] in other words what you see is what you
[1:33:59] get
[1:34:01] there's no objective here outside of
[1:34:03] christ jesus
[1:34:05] amen that's what that should be always
[1:34:07] our aim
[1:34:09] and verse 4 it said instead our
[1:34:11] spiritual weapons let's say our weapons
[1:34:14] our weapons are energized with divine
[1:34:17] power to effectively dismantle the
[1:34:20] defenses behind which people hide
[1:34:27] i read that one more time
[1:34:30] it says instead let's say instead
[1:34:33] our spiritual weapons are energized
[1:34:36] in other words there's a supernatural
[1:34:38] element to your weapon
[1:34:40] what is your weapon
[1:34:44] it ain't no physical sword it's a
[1:34:46] spiritual sword i want to say this sword
[1:34:48] does a whole lot more than the physical
[1:34:51] sword
[1:34:53] because it knows the thoughts and the
[1:34:54] intents of the heart
[1:34:56] it's a sharper sword
[1:34:59] amen our spiritual weapons are energized
[1:35:02] with divine power supernatural power to
[1:35:05] effectively dismantle in other words
[1:35:08] tear down the defenses by which people
[1:35:11] hide
[1:35:13] people can hide behind a smile
[1:35:15] people can hide behind a quote
[1:35:18] people can hide behind the scripture
[1:35:20] amen but the power of god the spirit of
[1:35:23] god is greater than all that it's
[1:35:25] energized by a supernatural element with
[1:35:28] jesus christ himself through the baptism
[1:35:30] of the holy ghost in ministers lives and
[1:35:33] it comes and dismantles the things
[1:35:36] people hide behind not to destroy the
[1:35:38] person but for victory in the person's
[1:35:41] life
[1:35:43] hallelujah
[1:35:45] it dismantles in other words it tears it
[1:35:48] down
[1:35:50] that's why in the king james says
[1:35:52] casting down imaginations
[1:35:55] it dismantles it
[1:35:57] it goes further in verse five it says
[1:36:00] we can demolish
[1:36:02] i like those words
[1:36:04] demolitions mean that is put to rubble
[1:36:08] it's put to rubble
[1:36:09] we can demolish every deceptive fantasy
[1:36:12] that opposes god and break through every
[1:36:16] arrogant attitude that is raised up in
[1:36:19] defiance of the true knowledge of god we
[1:36:22] capture
[1:36:23] like prisoners of war
[1:36:25] every thought let's say every thought
[1:36:27] and insist that it bow in obedience to
[1:36:31] the anointed one well there's only one
[1:36:34] anointed one and his name is jesus
[1:36:36] christ amen it bows in obedience to the
[1:36:40] word of god
[1:36:42] amen
[1:36:44] in the power of decision caleb and
[1:36:46] joshua would look into god's promise god
[1:36:48] said i've already give it to you
[1:36:51] hallelujah
[1:36:52] that's what's the matter with the people
[1:36:53] tonight in divine healing and everything
[1:36:55] it's yours go take it
[1:36:57] peace brother brown says again
[1:36:59] hallelujah god promised you to walk
[1:37:01] brethren you believe it you have to take
[1:37:03] it god promised you life brother do you
[1:37:06] believe it take it god promise you joy
[1:37:08] brother do you believe it take it do you
[1:37:11] have joy tonight
[1:37:12] amen then if you don't have joy then i
[1:37:15] say take it tonight
[1:37:17] amen god said i will give it to you it's
[1:37:19] yours
[1:37:20] now won't be right for god to go and
[1:37:23] dish all the things out
[1:37:26] he gave them the land they've got to do
[1:37:28] the house cleaning amen it's yours but
[1:37:31] we ain't gonna come poke it down your
[1:37:33] neck you've got to take the land
[1:37:35] yourself you you give it he give it to
[1:37:37] you it's yours arise and possess it
[1:37:41] hallelujah it's your choice
[1:37:44] if you want to murmur like the other 10
[1:37:47] did say i'm awake
[1:37:50] if you want a murmur like the other 10
[1:37:52] did you wander in the wilderness a long
[1:37:55] time i just want to say if you want to
[1:37:57] keep murmuring you're going to miss the
[1:37:59] rapture
[1:38:01] time to quit murmuring it's time to take
[1:38:03] the word believe the word and be
[1:38:06] positive about the word you say well i
[1:38:08] don't feel positive in my heart you keep
[1:38:11] positive words in your mouth and your
[1:38:13] body will come into subjection to the
[1:38:16] word of god but it's up to you to take
[1:38:19] the word
[1:38:21] believe the word
[1:38:23] use the word
[1:38:27] not sit back and well i don't know
[1:38:30] i don't know i really don't know if i
[1:38:32] feel like going to church saturday night
[1:38:35] had a long week and
[1:38:37] a lot of other things i can do
[1:38:40] brother andrew's just going to preach
[1:38:41] anyhow you know what
[1:38:43] he's been getting on my hide the last
[1:38:44] while
[1:38:46] i don't know if he has or not i haven't
[1:38:47] listened
[1:38:49] i do that purposely
[1:38:55] i don't know
[1:38:57] i don't know if i'm just going to take
[1:38:58] it anymore
[1:39:01] you know you're fighting a demon
[1:39:06] that's what you're fighting
[1:39:08] that's why you got to lay it down
[1:39:10] say you know i'm going to go to the
[1:39:11] house of lord
[1:39:13] whether it burns my head or not
[1:39:16] because god knows what i need
[1:39:19] amen remember we're in lady osea
[1:39:22] people write
[1:39:24] they think they have it all but what
[1:39:26] they don't have is the spirit of god
[1:39:29] amen i believe that people need a real
[1:39:30] good holy dose of feeling
[1:39:33] i need to be born again
[1:39:35] hey i told my church back home we
[1:39:37] everybody was born again in the church
[1:39:38] here we didn't have to preach certain
[1:39:40] things
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:47] that one's for free
[1:39:51] ask for free i always say that you
[1:39:53] should take the offering after the
[1:39:55] pastor preaches because they maybe
[1:39:56] wouldn't get as much i don't know
[1:40:00] that's for free too
[1:40:03] can you take it
[1:40:08] it's been given to each one of us but we
[1:40:09] have to pull our sword
[1:40:12] what good is a sword in the sheath
[1:40:15] what good is a sword in the sheath
[1:40:18] could you imagine
[1:40:20] uh with uh the men in the bible
[1:40:23] when they went to meet someone they
[1:40:24] pulled the sword
[1:40:26] and they weren't dainty about it either
[1:40:29] they pulled the sword they they had an
[1:40:31] objective joshua he pulled he saw that
[1:40:33] man by
[1:40:34] he pulled the sword
[1:40:37] and the first words out of his mouth
[1:40:38] were are you for us or against us
[1:40:41] in other words if you're against us
[1:40:43] you're going to have a problem right now
[1:40:46] because i'm not here to be dainty about
[1:40:49] it i'm here to take action and
[1:40:51] literally yeah
[1:40:57] yeah
[1:40:58] in other words you breathe your last
[1:41:00] breath
[1:41:04] he had an objective he was actually
[1:41:05] moving the power underneath the power of
[1:41:07] god he was commissioned
[1:41:09] we've been commissioned
[1:41:12] amen
[1:41:13] i don't want to i don't want to be uh
[1:41:15] he's like brother ron has that sign i
[1:41:17] like that sign it's not the size and the
[1:41:18] fight of the dog but
[1:41:21] help me jesus
[1:41:25] but it's the size the size of the fight
[1:41:27] in the dog that matters
[1:41:32] it's not how big we are
[1:41:34] but it's how much fight do you have
[1:41:35] inside of you
[1:41:37] i'm in a battle you're in a battle
[1:41:40] after covet has been a big battle
[1:41:48] what good an offense the weapon is if

[1:41:57] don't kill your enemy your enemy will
[1:41:59] kill you

[1:42:04] christ out of your life

[1:42:09] make sure you keep that
[1:42:11] to give you some sense of some sense of
[1:42:13] security

[1:44:46] yeah sure we get weary from time to time
[1:44:48] i'm here to lift up your hands tonight
[1:44:51] i'm here to remind you what god says
[1:44:53] that we have already made it
[1:44:56] you say then why are we fighting because
[1:44:57] until we get our body changed we gotta
[1:44:59] fight
[1:45:03] the devil's not dainty i'm not dating
[1:45:07] he don't love me and i don't love him
[1:45:10] we both have the same agreement we hate
[1:45:12] one another
[1:45:13] and i'm not about to make no pacts with
[1:45:15] him
[1:45:16] i ain't gonna do what israel did when
[1:45:18] they were supposed to con consume the
[1:45:20] whole land and they started making deals
[1:45:21] with the people in the land
[1:45:23] i'm not gonna do that became a snare
[1:45:25] unto them this bride will not do that
[1:45:28] i'm gonna talk very affirmative this
[1:45:30] bride will not do that this bride is
[1:45:32] going to make no agreements with the
[1:45:35] powers of darkness this bride has taken
[1:45:37] god's word and put it in her mouth and
[1:45:40] speaking the word in faith knowing that
[1:45:43] god will back up his own word because
[1:45:46] it's not my word it's not your word it's
[1:45:48] the king's word it's the king sword
[1:45:54] we have to take it
[1:45:56] believe it
[1:45:58] laid it in our heart
[1:46:01] when we pray we believe god answers
[1:46:03] prayer
[1:46:04] amen we have prayed when we pray for our
[1:46:06] loved ones we believe that god will send
[1:46:09] the holy ghost to them and he is sending
[1:46:12] the holy ghost to them and they're
[1:46:14] coming back into the kingdom of god and
[1:46:17] god rich in mercy
[1:46:19] hallelujah is embracing them
[1:46:25] the prodigals are coming home
[1:46:29] hallelujah
[1:46:31] glory to god
[1:46:36] god could not say
[1:46:38] and push us through a little pipe and
[1:46:39] pull us out the other end and then say
[1:46:41] blessed is he that overcometh
[1:46:45] he had nothing to overcome
[1:46:48] nothing to overcome
[1:46:49] he just pushed you through
[1:46:51] but you've got to make that decision for
[1:46:53] yourself i have to make it for myself
[1:46:56] in doing that we show our faith and
[1:46:58] respects to god
[1:47:00] amen so we have something to do
[1:47:02] we're going to fight
[1:47:05] i'm not going to quit fighting
[1:47:09] no
[1:47:11] it don't matter what the enemy does i'm
[1:47:12] not going to quit fighting
[1:47:15] i'm determined to make it through
[1:47:18] the word overcometh in the greek and i
[1:47:19] maybe shared this years ago it means to
[1:47:21] carry off victory come on victorious of
[1:47:23] christ victorious over all his foes
[1:47:26] of christians that hold fast their faith
[1:47:28] even unto death
[1:47:29] against the power of their foes and
[1:47:31] temptations of persecutions
[1:47:33] when one is arraigned or goes to law to
[1:47:35] win the case maintain one's cause
[1:47:38] the power of their foes christ being the
[1:47:40] lamb of god that defeated and was
[1:47:41] victorious over all his foes gives us
[1:47:44] victory over all our foes
[1:47:48] amen we have victory over all of our
[1:47:50] foes
[1:47:52] i saw at the back of your church that
[1:47:54] and that you have that book hamgar there
[1:47:57] and shamkar is is one of my heroes in
[1:47:59] the bible
[1:48:01] a lot written about him
[1:48:03] just a little bit written about him but
[1:48:05] what was written about him is is really
[1:48:07] encouraging
[1:48:09] amen because he was just a plain guy he
[1:48:11] was just a farmer
[1:48:13] and you probably know this but as bears
[1:48:15] repeating the word shamgar means sword
[1:48:17] in the hebrew
[1:48:19] it means sword
[1:48:21] he's just a farmer
[1:48:23] and you know what the devil was trying
[1:48:24] to do he was trying to take away his
[1:48:26] daily bread
[1:48:27] try to take away from his spiritual walk
[1:48:31] take away from his prayer life
[1:48:34] take away from from reading the word
[1:48:37] i'll just give him just a little bit
[1:48:39] just to survive so next year we're going
[1:48:41] to come get some more but there came one
[1:48:43] year that he was he was fed up
[1:48:46] and the spirit of the lord would come
[1:48:48] down and brother brown said they were so
[1:48:49] poor their kids and rags they were in
[1:48:51] rag they couldn't hardly make a living
[1:48:53] and and i looked that up and an ox gourd
[1:48:56] is about eight foot long a big old thing
[1:48:59] it got a big point in one end and a big
[1:49:01] ball on the other end to chisel or to to
[1:49:03] bang off the the clay that would
[1:49:05] actually get on the plow as they were
[1:49:06] plowing
[1:49:08] it was it was something that they did
[1:49:10] back in those days it wasn't a
[1:49:11] conventional weapon it wasn't no sword
[1:49:14] but but yet it was something that he had
[1:49:16] in his hand
[1:49:17] and sometimes it just matters what's in
[1:49:19] your hand
[1:49:20] amen when the right point comes the
[1:49:22] enemy comes in the temptations are there
[1:49:24] it's what's in your hand that matters
[1:49:26] amen i trust it's the word of god that's
[1:49:28] within your hand amen the bible says thy
[1:49:30] word have i hid in my heart that i would
[1:49:32] not sin against you somebody say praise
[1:49:34] the lord
[1:49:35] amen i don't want to sin against him i
[1:49:37] want to keep myself clean before him all
[1:49:39] the time
[1:49:40] amen and so that last time shamgar he
[1:49:42] had enough of it he said in his own
[1:49:45] heart when they came up there again with
[1:49:47] uh 600 men he said that's it i don't
[1:49:50] care how many men are there i am not
[1:49:53] going to deal with this any longer and
[1:49:55] he took that aux cord and he killed 600
[1:49:58] men
[1:49:59] i don't know how if you know how many
[1:50:01] 600 men it's a lot of men
[1:50:04] and they all had their armors on and
[1:50:05] they all had their swords shields and
[1:50:07] their swords they were men that were
[1:50:09] trained in the art of warfare but god
[1:50:12] don't need any men trained in the art of
[1:50:14] warfare what he needs is to get some
[1:50:16] person in the palm of his hand that will
[1:50:19] commit their heart to him that he can
[1:50:21] use them for his glory amen they will
[1:50:23] tear down the temple the the the kingdom
[1:50:26] of the devil
[1:50:28] amen and he had it in his heart i can
[1:50:31] just see that victory someday we get to
[1:50:33] meet shamgar i'm going to talk to sean
[1:50:35] mcgarry
[1:50:36] what happened and he's going to say the
[1:50:39] same thing he's going to ask us what
[1:50:40] happened to lady oseah we're going to
[1:50:42] say what was the power of the holy
[1:50:44] spirit that overshadowed me right at the
[1:50:46] right time and god gave me the fortitude
[1:50:49] to go forward and i just followed the
[1:50:51] word he's going to say the spirit of god
[1:50:54] came on me and i looked at those 600
[1:50:56] philistines as dead men
[1:51:01] can you imagine 600 of them piled up at
[1:51:03] the end of his field
[1:51:10] the devil criticizes our worship
[1:51:14] maybe not here but sure do in canada
[1:51:18] i don't know why people have a problem
[1:51:19] with people getting happy in church
[1:51:22] i always tell i always tell the people
[1:51:24] what in the world is wrong with getting
[1:51:25] happy
[1:51:26] if i can't get happy in the house of god
[1:51:29] where in the world can i get happy
[1:51:32] amen i don't want to say this in the
[1:51:34] wrong way but
[1:51:36] but a lot of times we we get into our
[1:51:38] cars and that's when the devil comes and
[1:51:40] brings some real interesting things in
[1:51:42] the car on the way home from church
[1:51:45] it's anything but happy
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:49] maybe if we got a little happier in
[1:51:51] church maybe maybe those things wouldn't
[1:51:52] happen i don't know
[1:51:54] amen because if our hearts were in tune
[1:51:56] with one another we would be able to
[1:51:58] realize oh this is a trap of the devil
[1:52:00] he gonna try to get us now on our way
[1:52:02] home but there's no way i'm going to get
[1:52:03] him on my way home i'm going to praise
[1:52:05] him right out of these windows right
[1:52:07] here if he wants to hang around and
[1:52:09] listen to me praise for a while i'm just
[1:52:11] going to keep praising amen why because
[1:52:13] you picked up that anointing in the
[1:52:15] house of the lord
[1:52:16] amen and god moved upon your heart
[1:52:20] amen glory
[1:52:23] i told the church back home i don't care
[1:52:24] how much our worship is criticized it
[1:52:27] will make no difference to me i'm going
[1:52:28] to worship the lord amen and i look like
[1:52:31] david of old you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:52:34] amen because i'm not going to have no
[1:52:36] barren church our church is going to
[1:52:38] have seed in our church it's going to be
[1:52:40] the seed of almighty god amen because
[1:52:43] i'm taking my position i'm going to pull
[1:52:46] my sword i'm going to fight the good
[1:52:48] fight of faith i'm going to destroy the
[1:52:51] enemy
[1:52:55] it's time to destroy him
[1:52:59] remember in the in the book of
[1:53:01] revelation
[1:53:03] i hope i'm not going too long
[1:53:05] in the book of revelation
[1:53:08] the bible talks about that the devil
[1:53:10] came down because we come up
[1:53:13] that means he had nobody to work on
[1:53:15] anymore
[1:53:20] we caught the vision
[1:53:24] and we caught the vision we realized
[1:53:27] that god is the one fighting our battles
[1:53:29] for us
[1:53:30] victory's been given to us
[1:53:33] you know brother abraham he said he said
[1:53:34] dave that peter knew how to weld the
[1:53:36] sword
[1:53:37] went to the garden of
[1:53:38] gethsemane he could cut off a high
[1:53:41] priest's servant's ear
[1:53:43] he had a pretty good aim
[1:53:45] he wanted the neck but he got the ear
[1:53:48] and the lord said on him peter put up
[1:53:50] your sword
[1:53:51] which was a physical sword in other
[1:53:54] words peter from this day forward we're
[1:53:56] not going to have this battle fight
[1:53:57] between one another no more
[1:54:00] because it's going to be a spiritual
[1:54:01] warfare now
[1:54:02] we're just going to change the sword
[1:54:04] from physical metal
[1:54:06] to something that's
[1:54:08] that's my word
[1:54:10] and so when peter was filled with the
[1:54:12] holy ghost that changed his life
[1:54:14] when you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:54:16] it changes your life
[1:54:18] you're not the same person you used to
[1:54:20] be
[1:54:21] you've got somebody else running in the
[1:54:23] in the in the room over here
[1:54:26] i heard brother calvin preaches to the
[1:54:27] young people but bears repeating because
[1:54:29] it's such a good thought
[1:54:31] they made they have this this new
[1:54:32] mechanism that they can put into certain
[1:54:34] size ships it's called a gyro
[1:54:37] and what a gyro does is when it spins in
[1:54:40] the ship it brings balance and unity
[1:54:43] within the ship
[1:54:44] and so when the ship is in large really
[1:54:47] large waves it doesn't take the ship out
[1:54:49] of the waves but what it does is it
[1:54:51] gives stability in the waves
[1:54:54] because it starts to turn in there and
[1:54:56] the ship actually goes completely
[1:54:57] equilibrium i wrote on those things
[1:55:00] before those two wheels on it i don't
[1:55:01] know if that thing's going to fall over
[1:55:03] but it don't fall over you can actually
[1:55:05] stand on two wheels and nothing the gyro
[1:55:07] in there keeps the thing spinning right
[1:55:09] amen when you get the right thing in the
[1:55:10] heart which is the holy ghost which is
[1:55:12] your gyro it's gonna crest every wave
[1:55:15] it's gonna go through every wave it's
[1:55:17] going to do exactly what it has to do in
[1:55:19] your life amen why because the holy
[1:55:21] ghost controlling now the outcome of
[1:55:24] your life
[1:55:25] amen somebody's saying amen
[1:55:28] amen because god is in the right place
[1:55:30] it's no longer something that's just
[1:55:32] here but it's something that's dropped
[1:55:33] in has become your revelation within
[1:55:36] your heart that you realize who you are
[1:55:38] let's say i'm a son of god
[1:55:41] let's say i'm a
[1:55:42] daughter of god
[1:55:44] amen if we're sons and daughters of god
[1:55:46] then god is in control
[1:55:48] in acts chapter 3 we we read about peter
[1:55:50] and john when they went into the temple
[1:55:52] at the ninth hour to pray and there was
[1:55:54] a certain mouth from the mother's womb
[1:55:56] was carried and when they laid him at
[1:55:57] the gate of the temple which is called
[1:55:59] beautiful to ask alms they entered into
[1:56:02] that exact gate but there was a
[1:56:04] different result now than what happened
[1:56:06] over here in the garden of gethsemane
[1:56:08] because something else now was inside of
[1:56:10] peter i'll tell you what was inside of
[1:56:12] peter it was the lord jesus in spirit
[1:56:15] form amen he was the one that was inside
[1:56:17] of peter amen and peter with all
[1:56:20] authority that god had given said said
[1:56:23] silver and gold have i none but such as
[1:56:25] i have i give it unto you and he pulled
[1:56:28] the sword against the enemy and he said
[1:56:30] rise up and walk and that impotent man
[1:56:33] that was there had never walked in his
[1:56:35] life the bible said he got up and he
[1:56:37] started sleeping and jumping and going
[1:56:40] into the temple of god i brought this to
[1:56:42] my church back home i said can you
[1:56:45] imagine that man just sitting down as a
[1:56:47] bump on a pickle
[1:56:50] that's a direct quote by the way
[1:56:53] he said no he wouldn't set out down like
[1:56:55] that there was something that happened
[1:56:57] in his life and some thrill within his
[1:56:59] heart he had to praise the living god he
[1:57:02] never walked before but now he was
[1:57:05] walking what would happen when sons and
[1:57:08] daughters of god would get the holy
[1:57:10] ghost in their life and start their walk
[1:57:13] with god
[1:57:14] hallelujah
[1:57:17] you're going to move on to the power of
[1:57:18] god when the devil sees you he's going
[1:57:21] to get weary because of you because you
[1:57:23] tear him down
[1:57:26] pull your sword church
[1:57:29] fight the good fight of faith
[1:57:32] hallelujah
[1:57:33] [Applause]

[1:57:49] said here's what it was that i passed it

[1:58:48] quarter of patience you see you can't do
[1:58:50] it but yet god gives us that we possess
