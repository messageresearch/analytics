[35:13] made her great for me
[35:18] when I'm pulls against the wall
[35:22] and it looked as if it was over.
[35:26] [Music]
[35:27] You
[35:29] You made a way for me.
[35:34] And we're standing here
[35:38] only because you

[36:50] Hallelujah. Aren't you thankful
[36:53] &gt;&gt; to be serving a God that still can make
[36:55] a way?
[36:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the way, the truth, and
[36:59] the life, and I have found him to be a
[37:02] way maker
[37:03] &gt;&gt; in all of life's situations." Amen. It's
[37:06] good to be in the house of the Lord
[37:07] tonight, isn't it? Amen. We just want to
[37:09] greet you in the name of the Lord and
[37:11] just say, "God bless you." We certainly
[37:13] enjoyed the weekend services last
[37:15] weekend here. Brother Matthew just did a
[37:17] phenomenal job and
[37:20] bless you
[37:24] just
[37:26] [Applause]
[37:29] I'm the younger brother but I I am sure
[37:31] proud of my older brother and he uh he's
[37:34] he's made me proud a many of times and
[37:37] and uh certainly thankful for the word
[37:39] of the Lord last weekend and we
[37:42] appreciate the prayers for uh last week
[37:44] and us being there with uh Biscoll
[37:46] family and being able to go there, they
[37:48] they they mean so much to us and and we
[37:51] were able to just be a part. Brother
[37:53] Ron, brother Tim just did a wonderful
[37:55] job and and uh I just be honest, I I
[37:58] left there just just so challenged. And
[38:01] I'd like to kind of preach to you from
[38:03] from just some my thoughts from last
[38:06] weekend and just thinking about how how
[38:08] are we here? How are we at this era of
[38:11] time that that the ones that were
[38:13] standing so close to the prophet,
[38:16] they're beginning to go off the scene?
[38:18] And here's a people that were not even
[38:21] not even close.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; We weren't even in the building, but
[38:25] you're still standing here. And
[38:28] &gt;&gt; I just thinking I just thinking about it
[38:29] all. You know, God's God's doing
[38:31] something spectacular. and
[38:33] &gt;&gt; and uh if you haven't watched that that
[38:35] memorial service, I I just I mean to be
[38:39] honest, I've never witnessed anything
[38:41] quite like that. It was it was it was so
[38:44] uplifting and challenging. And brother
[38:46] Tim, Brother Ron just did a wonderful
[38:48] job. And so we just want to we just want
[38:51] to continue to pray for the Biscll
[38:52] family. Sister Ruth, uh Sister Ruth
[38:54] Biscll was just just absolutely
[38:57] phenomenal. I've never met anybody like
[38:59] that in my entire life of going through
[39:01] funerals and things. And she said, "I've
[39:03] not shed one tear." She said, "I'm not
[39:05] saying I won't in the future, but I've
[39:07] not shed one tear." She said, "I'm just
[39:08] so full of joy." She said, "All I want
[39:10] to know, what is Brother Eddie doing on
[39:12] that side?" And it's amazing to
[39:15] recognize that there's a real believer
[39:17] right there that my goodness, my it's
[39:20] just it's just wonderful thing to be a
[39:22] Christian. We got no reason to be sad.
[39:24] We've got everything to be joyful about.
[39:27] Amen. We're certainly joyful to be in
[39:29] the house of the Lord tonight. We we
[39:31] have a rebaptism tonight after the end
[39:33] of the service and then tomorrow we'll
[39:35] be having uh communion and foot washing.
[39:37] So uh we're going to have oursel a
[39:40] ordinance weekend here. So so uh we just
[39:44] looking under the Lord. I believe God's
[39:45] got some special things. We want to come
[39:48] solemnly solemnly and just come with a
[39:51] reverence in our heart realizing that
[39:54] this is a very special time. And so we
[39:56] just want to prepare our hearts, amen,
[39:58] for the things that God has in store. If
[40:01] you have your Bible tonight, we'd like
[40:03] to just look over in Zechariah 4 and
[40:07] verse 6 and John chapter 17 and verse
[40:11] one.
[40:27] Also want to make mention to you,
[40:28] brother Mark Spencer will be here
[40:30] ministering for us here next weekend. So
[40:33] we want to be remembering him. I know
[40:36] that you will have a barrel of fun
[40:41] &gt;&gt; and a good time in the word. Amen.
[40:43] Certainly certainly love my my uncle
[40:46] Mark. He he means a lot to us and and
[40:49] we're certainly thankful for his
[40:51] ministry and we just invite him to come

[41:03] those things in prayer. So many things
[41:05] to be praying for. Amen. And just just
[41:08] be praying with us as well. And in three
[41:10] weeks I will be traveling to Poland,
[41:12] good Lord willing, to dedicate the
[41:14] church there in Poland. And uh good news
[41:17] is after that trip I'm off the scene for
[41:20] quite some time. I'll be right here. So
[41:24] well I can go out more if y'all
[41:28] Matt they might like you more often
[41:29] around here. So
[41:32] well whether y'all want me here or not
[41:34] I'm going to be here. So
[41:39] [Applause]
[41:42] Amen. In Zechariah 4 and verse 6, then
[41:46] he answered and spake unto me, saying,
[41:49] This is the word of the Lord unto
[41:51] Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
[41:53] power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord
[41:56] of hosts. Who art thou, oh great
[41:58] mountain before Zerubabel, thou shalt
[42:01] become a plain, and he shall bring forth
[42:03] the headstone thereof with shoutings,
[42:06] crying, grace, grace unto it. Moreover,
[42:09] the word of the Lord came unto me,
[42:10] saying, The hands of Zerubabel have laid
[42:13] the foundation of this house. His hands
[42:16] shall also finish it, and thou shalt
[42:19] know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me
[42:22] unto you. John chapter 17 and verse one.
[42:37] These words spake Jesus and lifted up
[42:40] his eyes to heaven and said, "Father,
[42:42] the hour is come. glorify thy son
[42:47] that thy son also may glorify thee as
[42:50] thou hast given him power over all flesh
[42:53] that he should give eternal life to as
[42:55] many as thou hast given him and this is
[42:58] life eternal that they might know thee
[43:01] the only true God and Jesus Christ whom
[43:03] thou hast sent and I have glorified thee
[43:06] on earth and I have finished the work
[43:08] which thou gavest me to do amen let's
[43:12] just talk to the Lord just for a minute
[43:14] Father, we come before you tonight,
[43:15] Lord, and we humble ourselves before the
[43:17] great I am. Lord, we recognize, Lord
[43:20] Jesus, this is the building that you're
[43:22] wanting to build, a body of believers
[43:24] that truly are under the inspiration of
[43:28] the Holy Ghost. And Father, we just ask,
[43:30] Lord, as we would bask in your presence
[43:31] tonight, that your word would come and
[43:34] purge our hearts and manifest your
[43:36] glory, Father, right through us, Lord.
[43:38] For truly Lord, we've come to the house
[43:40] of correction Lord for a word to correct
[43:43] the errors and to correct Leoa and to
[43:45] make us to be more like unto thee,
[43:48] Father. So we ask Lord tonight as the
[43:50] word would go forth that you would just
[43:52] minister to us every need that has been
[43:54] lifted up, every every church member
[43:57] here. We ask God that you would bless
[43:58] them Lord by the preaching of the word.
[44:01] May May the sinner may he come to a
[44:04] recognition a recognition that he needs
[44:06] to come to a place of salvation. Father,
[44:09] may those that are sick, may they come
[44:11] to a recognition that there is healing
[44:13] that flowed down from Calvary for them.
[44:15] And we ask, Father, that you would just
[44:17] go, Lord, and let thy word be a
[44:20] discerner of the thoughts and the
[44:21] intents of our heart. As we look unto
[44:24] you, the author and the finisher of our
[44:25] faith, we believe that you are God. And
[44:28] we ask that you would come tonight as we
[44:31] invite you to take the pull pit just now
[44:33] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[44:36] amen. You may be seated tonight in the
[44:38] presence of the Lord. I'd like to just
[44:40] take a little thought that's been on my
[44:42] heart on challenge to finish. Challenge
[44:45] to finish. And and if you begin to look
[44:48] at that word uh finished, it means to be
[44:52] completed. It means to be brought to an
[44:55] end. It's saying that nothing else is
[44:58] more required of the thing that the task
[45:01] or the project or the progress on the
[45:04] matter is completely done. It has been
[45:07] perfected. It has been polished to a
[45:09] spot where it no longer needs to be buff
[45:12] buffed or needs to be needs to be it has
[45:15] been it has been to its attended state.
[45:18] It means that it is in a no longer in a
[45:21] process but it has come to its final
[45:23] state. And I believe that the message of
[45:26] the hour has put a mandate on the church
[45:28] of the living God to finish the things
[45:31] that God has started in this hour. And I
[45:34] believe that what this message has done
[45:36] is exactly that. It has challenged us to
[45:40] finish what Jesus Christ started 2,000
[45:43] years ago. That which he did not
[45:45] accomplish in three and a half years in
[45:47] his eternal or in his physical body, he
[45:50] is now finishing in his corporal body.
[45:53] the body of Jesus Christ. Now, brother
[45:55] Manam said in the message of grace, he
[45:58] said, "Now, according to prophecy," he
[45:59] said, "there will come a headstone." He
[46:02] said, "I want you to notice that when
[46:04] that headstone comes, the prince that's
[46:06] going to cry out, the message will cry
[46:08] out, grace, grace. For it's by grace are
[46:10] we saved and not of works, lest any man
[46:13] should boast." The message of grace has
[46:16] been tramped under the feet of men until
[46:18] it's become a disgrace.
[46:21] And I could say that's the truth where
[46:23] people think that they can get by with
[46:25] anything and they'll say, "Well, God
[46:27] still got grace to save me." But I
[46:30] believe that if if God if we recognize
[46:32] the power and the message of grace that
[46:34] we have received, it will turn us into
[46:38] recognizing the power of this grace. And
[46:41] it'll make us be so locked in and
[46:44] focused that we will recognize that we
[46:46] ought to be challenged to live so clean
[46:49] and so pure before that great I am. He
[46:51] said the message of grace has been
[46:53] tramped under the feet of men until it's
[46:55] become a disgrace. He said some of them
[46:58] runs out into etern eternal security and
[47:00] some runs in now on to everything. He
[47:02] said but the true message of grace
[47:04] remains the same. He said it remains the
[47:07] same. And that's where Satan tries to
[47:09] knock it from the church. You see,
[47:11] that's the fight that you and I have
[47:13] today is because Satan wants to take and
[47:16] knock the message of grace right out and
[47:18] say that grace is no longer and that
[47:20] grace cannot be extended. But I want you
[47:23] to know that no matter where you are, no
[47:25] matter if you feel unworthy, no matter
[47:28] how far that you've gone in God, I want
[47:30] you to know that there is grace still
[47:33] sufficient for every single one of your
[47:35] needs of your life. And you may not feel
[47:38] like you are worthy to finish this race.
[47:40] But God almighty saw that you was worth
[47:43] anointing and challenging you to finish
[47:46] what God has in store for the church of
[47:49] the living God.
[47:51] I want to say it like this that we are
[47:53] believers and as believers that we ought
[47:56] to aim to fulfill the portion or the
[47:59] specific work that God has for us and
[48:02] that while we are here that we ought to
[48:04] work to get the allotted word of our
[48:06] hour completely finished. Now you look
[48:09] at Moses's life and Moses was a man that
[48:12] if you could look at it in this way he
[48:14] was challenged to finish. He was going
[48:16] to do everything within his power to
[48:19] finish the commission that God had given
[48:21] them to take his seed into a s into a
[48:25] strange land to bring them into a
[48:27] promised land. But Moses, when you look
[48:30] at it, Moses was not able to finish
[48:34] &gt;&gt; because he was only allowed to go up
[48:36] into Mount Nebo and he could only go so
[48:39] far. But I want you to know as an older
[48:41] generation, you might feel like your
[48:43] purpose has ended and you're not doing
[48:46] anything no more. Do you realize what
[48:48] Moses's finishing was? He was simply
[48:51] preparing the next generation to step up
[48:54] and accept what he was called for.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; You see, I would say it like this that
[49:02] we are a generation with a purpose. Just
[49:05] as every age, every every age like Noah,
[49:09] Moses, and the prophets, they all had a
[49:12] they all had a portion of the word that
[49:14] they were going to fulfill. Now, notice
[49:16] what the Bible said in Acts 13 and 36.
[49:19] For David, after he had served his own
[49:23] generation, after he had served his own
[49:26] generation by the will of God, he fell
[49:28] on sleep and was laid unto his fathers
[49:31] and saw corruption. It was not after. It
[49:34] was not before, but it was after he had
[49:37] completely accomplished the work that
[49:39] he'd been given.
[49:42] Hallelujah. But I wasn't born in the
[49:44] right family. I wasn't born to a king's
[49:46] home. I wasn't born into a pastor's
[49:48] family. You are not here by accident.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are only here to fulfill
[49:56] God's divine appointment for your life.
[49:58] And you may not understand it, young
[50:00] people, why you are in the room. And
[50:02] maybe you feel like your parents have
[50:04] brought you to church. You are not here
[50:06] just because your parents brought you to
[50:08] church. You are here to finish what God
[50:12] has started.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:16] This current generation is here to
[50:19] transform
[50:21] the age by fulfilling its specific
[50:23] portion of God's word in this allotted
[50:27] time. So we could say that you're
[50:29] anointed to finish. You're anointed to
[50:32] finish this age of of of of Leosa and
[50:36] not be a part of Leoa, to not be
[50:39] lukewarm, to not be caught up with the
[50:41] ideologies of the world and and to get
[50:43] cold on God and to be a serving a a
[50:46] serving God by tradition. But you are
[50:49] anointed. Hallelujah.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; You are anointed because the word of the
[50:54] Lord of this hour, the message has
[50:57] prepared you to finish.
[51:01] So we are believers with authority.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; We are believers with authority because
[51:08] Jesus said, "As my father have sent me,
[51:11] even so send I you." I say that all of
[51:15] heaven has authorized me to be here and
[51:18] I am called.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; I am elected. I am anointed. I am
[51:24] challenged to finish.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to maintain tradition. I am
[51:30] not here just to take up a spot and I'm
[51:32] not here just to be a spectator, but I
[51:35] am called to manifest the finishing of
[51:38] this word.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Paul ran his race.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Luther ran his race. Wesley
[51:46] ran his race. William Brandham ran his
[51:49] race. But it's my time and it's my What
[51:52] are you going to do with your time?
[51:57] What are you going to do when God calls
[51:59] on you? What are you going to do with
[52:01] your time?
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; As Paul said, I don't know what you're
[52:09] going to do.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; And I don't know what side you're going
[52:13] to take,
[52:15] but I have fought a good fight.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; I can't say for the rest of this
[52:20] generation what they're going to do, but
[52:22] I'm gonna say it like Paul said. I have
[52:24] fought a good fight. I have finished my
[52:27] course and I have kept the faith. And I
[52:30] know that we live in a faithless
[52:32] generation. But for me, I'm going to be
[52:34] one of the few.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be one of the few that say,
[52:39] "I have fought a good fight. I have
[52:41] finished my course. I did what God
[52:43] called in me. And I have kept the faith
[52:46] through men talked about me. Though men
[52:48] said the message wasn't right, I have
[52:50] kept the faith.
[52:56] Hallelujah. So the same God, So the same
[53:00] God that started, who began the story in
[53:03] Genesis
[53:05] is will be the God that'll close it out
[53:07] in the book of Revelations
[53:09] through a people that know they are
[53:11] sent. A people that know that they are
[53:14] anointed to finish. 2 Timothy and 3:16
[53:17] that says that all scripture is given by
[53:20] inspiration of God and is profitable
[53:22] profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
[53:24] for correction, for instruction, and in
[53:26] righteousness that the man of God might
[53:28] be perfect.
[53:31] Perfect. How many perfect people we got
[53:33] in here?
[53:37] There you go. I got one believer here.
[53:41] How many people's perfect tonight?
[53:45] Come on. So, how many's perfect in here
[53:47] tonight?
[53:49] &gt;&gt; I know one lady saying amen
[53:53] cuz I know she's perfect.
[53:56] But how many believers can recognize
[53:58] that the word of the Lord has made them
[54:00] perfect? I'm not perfect in my flesh.
[54:04] I'm not perfect in my emotions. I'm not
[54:06] perfect in my mindset. But by the blood
[54:08] of Jesus Christ,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; by the word of the Lord, I have been
[54:13] perfected, thoroughly furnished unto
[54:17] good works
[54:19] &gt;&gt; to accomplish, to finish, to complete.
[54:22] The word is given to you to finish the
[54:26] work.
[54:31] Scary to think about perfect people
[54:32] sitting in this place.
[54:35] That's exactly why some of you moved
[54:37] here,
[54:39] cuz you was looking for a perfect
[54:40] church.
[54:42] Well, if you're looking through the
[54:43] blood, you found it. But if you're
[54:45] looking at our flesh, I tell you, we're
[54:48] going to let you down. But if you're
[54:50] looking through the eyes of Almighty
[54:52] God, you have found a perfect people
[54:55] bought with a price, sealed with the
[54:58] Holy Ghost, and born to be devil
[55:00] destroyers, serpent bruisers, to mash on
[55:03] the head of the enemy, a perfect people
[55:06] to destroy the works of Satan.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; When Jesus is there in the book of
[55:13] Revelations, he said, "I am alpha and
[55:16] omega."
[55:18] When you look at it, alpha is the A of
[55:21] the Greek alphabet and omega is a Z of
[55:25] the alphabet. And Jesus said, "I'm the
[55:27] beginning and I'm the end." He said,
[55:29] "You put all the words together that you
[55:31] can make up with the alphabet and I will
[55:33] be all of that to you and I will be all
[55:35] that and more. And I'm going to put
[55:37] something on the inside of you. I'm
[55:39] going to put a witness of myself on the
[55:42] inside of you that you won't have to go
[55:44] out there and fight and challenge and
[55:46] try to do it on your own. But I will be
[55:48] your everything if you make me your
[55:50] everything.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:55] Notice what the Bible said in John 1. In
[55:58] the beginning was the word and the word
[55:59] was with God and the word was God. The
[56:01] same was in the beginning with God. All
[56:03] things were made by him, and without him
[56:06] was not anything made that was made,
[56:08] Paul said in Colossians 1:16, for by
[56:11] him, somebody say, by him,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; were all things created that are in
[56:15] heaven and that are in earth, visible
[56:18] and invisible, whether they be thrones
[56:20] or dominions or principalities or
[56:22] powers. All things were created, say, by
[56:24] him.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; And say, for him.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Say, I was created by him.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; And I was created for him.
[56:33] When God comes and he begins to speak
[56:36] the world into existence and he said let
[56:39] there be light. He said let there be
[56:41] affirmative and let there be this and
[56:43] let there be that. But when he comes to
[56:46] the end of his work and the Bible said
[56:49] in Genesis 2 that on the seventh day God
[56:52] ended his work which he had made and
[56:55] rested on the seventh day from all his
[56:58] work which he had made. I was made by
[57:01] him for him.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; So God spoke the word. He thought the
[57:07] word, spoke the word, and then the word
[57:10] was made manifest.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He brought to pass what he said. So the
[57:16] word has the ability to create. And if
[57:19] you really believe that he's the same
[57:21] yesterday, today, and forever, you will
[57:23] believe that for you and right now, that
[57:26] he is has the ability to create in you a
[57:30] new heart and within you a right spirit.
[57:33] That he can make you a new creature in
[57:36] Christ Jesus. So the word he spoke is
[57:39] the word. What he did is exactly what he
[57:43] said.
[57:46] The reason why there's a sun here is
[57:48] because he said it. The reason why
[57:50] there's a moon here is because he said
[57:53] it. There would never be one of you here
[57:56] unless he said it, spoke it, believed
[58:00] it, manifested it. So before there was
[58:02] an atom or a molecule or anything that
[58:05] was brought into creation, he thought of
[58:08] you.
[58:10] Then he spoke of you and now you're
[58:13] here. So you cannot separate God from
[58:16] what he does
[58:19] and what he says because what he says is
[58:22] what he does.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; I like that kind of math right there. I
[58:27] I can pass in this kind of I can pass it
[58:30] this kind of test right here. What he
[58:32] says is what he does and what he does is
[58:35] what he says. And I found out a whole
[58:37] lot of times about man is that man will
[58:39] say one thing and they will do another.
[58:41] But I have never found almighty God to
[58:43] ever let me down. What he says is what
[58:47] he does. He said I was an overcomer.
[58:50] Then I'm an overcomer. He said I was
[58:52] bloodbought. That means I'm bloodbought.
[58:55] He said I was elected. That means I am
[58:57] elected.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said there will be a
[59:02] people who under their messenger what he
[59:05] says is what he does.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; I feel like preaching right? What he
[59:10] says is what he does. If he said it heal
[59:13] you, that's what he'll do. If he said
[59:15] he'd save you, that's what he'll do. If
[59:18] he said it, then I believe it.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Numbers 23 and 19. God is not a man that
[59:28] he should lie, neither the son of man
[59:30] that he should repent. Have he said it,
[59:33] and shall he not do it, or have he
[59:36] spoken, and shall he not make it good?
[59:39] Tell me one time.
[59:43] Hallelujah.
[59:45] Tell me one time. His promises are not
[59:48] like the shifting sand. They're a rock
[59:51] you can stand on.
[59:53] Every prophecy, every covenant, every
[59:56] word spoken of your life has got to come
[59:59] to pass. It's kind of like a builder
[1:00:01] that's got unlimited funds. He can start
[1:00:04] the foundation and you ain't got to
[1:00:06] worry if he's got strength enough to do
[1:00:07] it. You ain't got to worry if he's got
[1:00:09] funds enough to finish it. Jesus said,
[1:00:12] "If I start it, then I'm going to finish
[1:00:14] it." That's what God is saying about
[1:00:16] your life. That if I started you, I'm
[1:00:19] going to finish your life.
[1:00:21] Come on, somebody. I want you to know
[1:00:24] that God did not just start you on the
[1:00:26] road to this message to lead you half
[1:00:29] the way.
[1:00:31] The message came across your path to put
[1:00:34] you in a rapture.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Looking unto
[1:00:41] Jesus, the author,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; the author, the beginner, and the
[1:00:47] finisher of my faith. I ain't got my
[1:00:50] eyes on Putin. I ain't got my eyes on
[1:00:53] Trump. I got my eyes.
[1:00:56] Oh, King Jesus.
[1:01:01] Paul said in Philippians 1:6, "Being
[1:01:04] confident of this very thing, which he
[1:01:06] hath begun a good work in you will
[1:01:08] perform it under the day of Jesus
[1:01:10] Christ." Solomon said in Ecclesiastes
[1:01:13] 7:8, "Better is the end of a thing."
[1:01:18] Better is the end of a thing than the
[1:01:21] than the beginning thereof.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Take a look around.
[1:01:30] Kind of like Sister Pat says sometimes,
[1:01:33] getting better like a fine wine.
[1:01:37] Getting better with age.
[1:01:39] Aren't you thankful I ain't preaching on
[1:01:41] the same elements that I was when I
[1:01:44] first started preaching? Some of you
[1:01:46] wish I was because I preached 17 minutes
[1:01:50] and I got it down to the end of it said
[1:01:52] that's all I got.
[1:01:56] But to be real honest, if I had to go
[1:01:58] back and watch that, thank God we didn't
[1:02:00] stream in.
[1:02:03] That'd be some humbling services right
[1:02:05] there.
[1:02:07] But if God would cap off my life right
[1:02:09] now
[1:02:12] or he cap off your life,
[1:02:15] are you still in the same spot or have
[1:02:18] you advanced?
[1:02:20] I would say like Solomon says, not about
[1:02:23] my ministry, but better is the end than
[1:02:27] the beginning thereof.
[1:02:30] And the patient in spirit is better than
[1:02:32] the proud in spirit.
[1:02:35] Hallelujah.
[1:02:38] I mean, well, you say, "Well, I can't
[1:02:40] fellowship with you on that because I'm
[1:02:42] still in the same spot. I haven't
[1:02:44] advanced my prayer life. I haven't
[1:02:46] advanced my listening to the mess." I
[1:02:47] haven't advanced. So, I can't really
[1:02:49] fellowship with you on that. Well, let
[1:02:51] me let me bring you over to maybe where
[1:02:53] your mind might you ever drove past a
[1:02:54] beautiful house, they're in the making
[1:02:57] of it, and they got they got everything
[1:03:00] up. They got the plywood, they got the
[1:03:01] bones and everything together, and it
[1:03:04] just stops all of a sudden. It's a It
[1:03:07] has the ability or the potential to be
[1:03:09] an absolute beautiful masterpiece of a
[1:03:11] house,
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; but some reason maybe the guy that was
[1:03:17] building it ran out of money or the guy
[1:03:19] that was building it, he got sick and he
[1:03:21] couldn't finish it. I tell you what it
[1:03:23] is. It's a monument of failure.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's a way that a lot of
[1:03:29] people are in Christian churches or
[1:03:31] message churches. They've never
[1:03:33] advanced. They never come to church
[1:03:35] early. They they can skip church and
[1:03:36] they can go here and there and they
[1:03:38] never advance and they're a monument of
[1:03:41] failure.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; But God didn't start something on the
[1:03:46] inside of you just so that you could be
[1:03:48] a failure. He elected you, anointed you,
[1:03:51] called you,
[1:03:54] and he put something on the inside of
[1:03:56] you to finish it.
[1:03:59] Finish the work.
[1:04:04] One man said, "How can I overcome?" He
[1:04:06] said, "And now he that starts, not he
[1:04:09] that starts, but he that finishes." Many
[1:04:12] start the race, but there's one finish.
[1:04:14] And he said, "There'll be many churches
[1:04:16] that start. Many of groups of people,"
[1:04:19] he said, "but there'll be one group
[1:04:20] finish."
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; There'll be one group finish, and that's
[1:04:25] the overcomers.
[1:04:30] If there's one going in Virginia,
[1:04:33] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:04:37] taking a spot. If there's one church
[1:04:40] going in Virginia, we taking a spot. If
[1:04:44] there's one people that's going, we're
[1:04:46] taking a spot. Why? Because God said it
[1:04:49] and God's going to do it.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I probably upset somebody
[1:04:55] cuz I didn't call their church's name.
[1:04:57] I'm sorry, but as for me and Full Gospel
[1:05:00] Lighthouse, we got one goal, and that's
[1:05:02] a rapture.
[1:05:05] You can come and go with us if you want
[1:05:06] to. You ain't got to go to my church,
[1:05:09] Brother Tim's church, Brother Donny's
[1:05:11] church, Brother Tom Ray's church. Just
[1:05:14] get under the token. Hallelujah.
[1:05:18] That's what God is wanting. A people
[1:05:20] under the broken blood sail completely
[1:05:24] washed by the blood.
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:32] You imagine,
[1:05:34] I read a statistic
[1:05:36] about those that start college and never
[1:05:39] finish it.
[1:05:42] 60%
[1:05:43] of people that start college,
[1:05:47] 60% is the only ones that finish it.
[1:05:51] So the people that you started with at
[1:05:53] 100%. Imagine 40% of them walking away.
[1:05:58] What if 40% of this church didn't make
[1:06:00] it?
[1:06:02] What if we're 40% of your own family
[1:06:04] didn't make it?
[1:06:06] You see, there's a lot of people that
[1:06:08] have great ambitions. There's a lot of
[1:06:10] people that want to do something for the
[1:06:12] Lord. There's a lot of people that want
[1:06:14] to escape,
[1:06:16] but they never want to get down to where
[1:06:19] the rubber meets the road.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; You see, when you begin to look at
[1:06:25] things in the natural, you see these men
[1:06:28] that run these marathons and women, they
[1:06:30] they they have trained for it. And
[1:06:33] marathon runners say that when you get
[1:06:35] to the wall, which is a 20 mile radius
[1:06:39] somewhere in that neighbor neighborhood,
[1:06:41] you hit a wall. And that's where a lot
[1:06:43] of people fall out. They can't make it
[1:06:46] no more. Their their feet are burning.
[1:06:49] They have ran all that they can run and
[1:06:52] they stop
[1:06:54] and they can't go no further. You know,
[1:06:56] over 30,000 people every single year get
[1:07:00] involved in the Boston Marathon and 97
[1:07:04] people 97% of people that join that
[1:07:07] marathon actually finish it. But there
[1:07:10] are thousands that cannot go the
[1:07:12] distance. There are thousand that give
[1:07:14] up because they just didn't have the
[1:07:16] stamina. They didn't have they got
[1:07:18] exhausted or maybe they got injured and
[1:07:20] they couldn't go all the way because
[1:07:22] they hadn't trained to finish.
[1:07:26] But I ain't talking about people that go
[1:07:27] halfway like Pharaoh wanted to offer
[1:07:30] Moses. He said, "If we're going," he
[1:07:32] said, "we're all going."
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; In the Olympics, out of millions who
[1:07:36] dream
[1:07:38] less than 0. 0001 ever compete.
[1:07:45] It takes an uncommon perseverance. Like
[1:07:48] brother Brandon would talk about George
[1:07:50] Washington. It takes uncommon faith to
[1:07:54] press through.
[1:07:56] Studies show that nearly 70% of kids in
[1:07:59] the US drop out of organized sports by
[1:08:02] the age 13. But don't tell little Johnny
[1:08:04] he ain't going to make it to the MLB.
[1:08:08] At 10 years old, he still got three
[1:08:09] years left.
[1:08:15] 70% of kids. I think it's amazing
[1:08:20] because I'll be honest, I had dreams of
[1:08:22] doing it, too.
[1:08:24] There's a lot of times I was out there
[1:08:26] in my front front yard on that gravel
[1:08:28] pad and I thought I was going to be the
[1:08:30] next guy that was going to play at the
[1:08:31] UNCC Tar Hills. And I'm going to tell
[1:08:33] you what, I dunked on that thing and I
[1:08:35] thought, man, they cannot live without
[1:08:37] me.
[1:08:41] I tell you what, my dreams got crushed
[1:08:45] by an eighth grade math teacher. They
[1:08:48] said I couldn't pass algebra.
[1:08:50] So therefore, I couldn't make it on the
[1:08:52] basketball team.
[1:08:54] So I couldn't finish my dreams because
[1:08:56] I'm an eighth grade math teacher.
[1:09:01] But you know, somebody gave up on an
[1:09:03] eighth grader one time and they said,
[1:09:05] "Nah, he ain't good enough."
[1:09:08] Hallelujah. And this man missed over
[1:09:11] 9,000 shots and lost over 300 games in
[1:09:14] his career. But he is known as one of
[1:09:16] the greatest finishers of all time. His
[1:09:19] name is Michael Jordan. And how would
[1:09:22] you like to been the guy that gave up on
[1:09:23] Michael Jordan? Said he ain't made he
[1:09:25] ain't good enough to make the cut.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; There's a whole lot of people in this
[1:09:33] message that gave up on me.
[1:09:35] There's a whole lot of people in this
[1:09:37] message that would have gave up on you.
[1:09:39] But I do not have a mentality of people
[1:09:42] that give up. I have never listened to a
[1:09:46] loser in my life
[1:09:49] and I'm not going to start now. I was
[1:09:52] born to be a winner and I believe you
[1:09:54] are too. So if you believe it or not,
[1:09:57] the Bible said, "As a man thinkketh in
[1:09:59] his heart, so is he." You cannot talk me
[1:10:03] out of it. You cannot shake me out of
[1:10:05] it. I'm a winner. I'm victorious. I'm an
[1:10:08] overcomer.
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; There was a runner by the name of Eric
[1:10:24] Liddell. They created a a movie about
[1:10:26] him in the 80s called The Chariots of
[1:10:29] Fire, I think.
[1:10:34] and he was a he was a runner in the
[1:10:37] Olympics,
[1:10:39] but they wouldn't let him compete
[1:10:42] because he refused to run on Sundays.
[1:10:48] He chose his faith over top of fame,
[1:10:53] but he still had a destiny in front of
[1:10:54] him. He said it in these words. He said,
[1:10:56] "When I'm running, I feel his pleasure
[1:10:58] on my life."
[1:11:02] He found a way to finish.
[1:11:05] He found a way to finish and he come out
[1:11:09] and he won the 400 meter in the Olympics
[1:11:12] when he chose his faith over top of fame
[1:11:16] instead of what people want, instead of
[1:11:18] what people say you got to do.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. You do not have to be
[1:11:24] a slave to lay out a sea. This word,
[1:11:28] this word will change your body. This
[1:11:30] word will change your mentality. This
[1:11:33] word will make you a finisher.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Notice in the Bible, you'll find that
[1:11:39] King David, he lived in a house of
[1:11:42] cedar. He lived in a house of mansions
[1:11:44] of gold and all the things. But he begin
[1:11:46] to look at it and said, "How in the
[1:11:47] world can my Lord live in a house?" and
[1:11:51] I live in this great big mansion. He
[1:11:53] said, 'I want to build you a house,
[1:11:55] Lord. And the prophet Nathan went to him
[1:11:58] said, "David, I brought you from the
[1:11:59] sheep coat." He said, "I made all of
[1:12:01] your enemies fall before you." He said,
[1:12:03] "But you sped you, you spared you bled
[1:12:07] too much. You brought caught too much
[1:12:09] blood upon the scene." He said, "I'm not
[1:12:11] going to allow you to build a house, but
[1:12:12] I'm going to raise up somebody in your
[1:12:14] lineage that will build me a house." And
[1:12:17] he raised up Solomon to build him a
[1:12:20] house. And David commissioned him, said,
[1:12:22] "Do it." In 1 Corinthians or 1st
[1:12:26] Chronicles 28 and 20, "And David said to
[1:12:29] Solomon his son, be strong and of a good
[1:12:31] courage and do it."
[1:12:34] There will be people that say you can't
[1:12:35] do it, but do it.
[1:12:39] There will be people that say you can't
[1:12:40] go the distance, but do it. Solomon,
[1:12:43] fear not, nor be dismayed, for the Lord
[1:12:47] the God, even my God, will be with thee.
[1:12:50] He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; until thou has finished all the work for
[1:12:57] the service of the house of the Lord.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; God's going to be with you.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm never going to leave you
[1:13:06] nor forsake you. I'll be with you even
[1:13:09] in you to the end of the work and you're
[1:13:11] going to finish it.
[1:13:14] Notice when Zerubbabel when you see him
[1:13:16] come into the picture in Zechariah 4,
[1:13:18] you begin to see that he was a spiritual
[1:13:20] head over top of the tribe of Judah at
[1:13:22] the time when when under the Babylonian
[1:13:26] captivity. He was the one that led the
[1:13:28] first group of captives back to
[1:13:30] Jerusalem. And he set it in his course
[1:13:33] to rebuilding of the temple after the
[1:13:35] Babylonian captivity and the Jews had
[1:13:38] returned to their land. Notice what
[1:13:40] brother Brandon says. He said, he said,
[1:13:41] "We're all acquainted with scriptures."
[1:13:43] He said, "That reads the Bible." He
[1:13:45] said, "We know that this was during the
[1:13:47] time of the preparation of the
[1:13:49] restoration of the temple and Jeru was a
[1:13:52] great prince amongst the people who had
[1:13:54] laid the foundation of the building." He
[1:13:56] said, "Now you, I want you to put on
[1:13:58] your spiritual thinking, anointing
[1:13:59] jacket this morning as we think." And
[1:14:01] this great prince had determined to
[1:14:03] rebuild the house of the Lord. And then
[1:14:05] when he did, he had laid the foundation
[1:14:07] stone. As we read on further, we find
[1:14:09] out that God said, "Jerubbable has laid
[1:14:12] the foundation with his hands. He also
[1:14:14] shall bring forth the headstone." He
[1:14:16] said, I want you to notice, he never
[1:14:18] said he shall bring forth the
[1:14:20] cornerstone, but he said he shall bring
[1:14:22] forth the headstone. Now we know that
[1:14:25] the scripture says that Jesus is the
[1:14:27] chief cornerstone but he's also the
[1:14:30] headstone. Now if we will think for a
[1:14:33] few minutes he said that the seventh
[1:14:35] church age messenger was to restore the
[1:14:37] faith of the children back to the
[1:14:40] fathers. In other words rebuild the
[1:14:43] church under the power of the spirit.
[1:14:47] Not by might, not by power, but by my
[1:14:50] spirit sayaith the Lord, not by
[1:14:52] organization, not by denomination, but
[1:14:55] by the Holy Spirit. God will bring forth
[1:14:58] the church in this last age.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Under the message he is beginning to
[1:15:05] rebuild,
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; rebuild the church under the power of
[1:15:10] the Holy Spirit. Therefore, that's why
[1:15:13] William Brandham said, he said that this
[1:15:15] age would be both mechanics and
[1:15:18] dynamics. That it would be a refilling
[1:15:21] of the Holy Spirit. That the dynamics is
[1:15:25] the outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? I'm saying that
[1:15:31] we're not in a horse and buggy day no
[1:15:33] more.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; We ain't in airplane day no more. But
[1:15:39] the prophet said that we were built for
[1:15:41] another atmosphere. But this is the
[1:15:44] astronaut age.
[1:15:47] Let me say it like this. You cannot put
[1:15:49] hay in my rocket and think it's going to
[1:15:51] take off.
[1:15:53] You cannot feed me corn and good grain
[1:15:55] and think I'm going to take off.
[1:15:58] But oh, if you put me some rocket fuel,
[1:16:02] the message of the hour on the inside of
[1:16:04] me, I'm built. I'm built for another
[1:16:08] atmosphere. I'm built to take off. I'm
[1:16:11] built to leave Leosa behind me.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; He said, I want you to get built up in
[1:16:16] the holy oracles of God in the faith of
[1:16:19] this hour. The faith, he said, it's
[1:16:20] going to take more faith than any other
[1:16:22] age. He said, for this has to be
[1:16:24] rapturing faith to be taken up. He said,
[1:16:27] we want you to accumulate all that
[1:16:29] together in your heart and consider
[1:16:32] whether this be of God or not.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; How many can say that this is God? Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Accumulate the things that you've seen.
[1:16:40] Accumulate the message.
[1:16:43] Accumulate what you see out there in the
[1:16:45] world.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going say if you want entertainment,
[1:16:49] watch the Pentecostals. But
[1:16:51] entertainment will not put you in a
[1:16:53] rapture.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not knocking on them
[1:16:59] brothers and sisters out there. I'm just
[1:17:00] simply saying that ain't going to feed
[1:17:02] me.
[1:17:04] They ain't going to feed me just because
[1:17:06] somebody jumps up and speaks in tongues
[1:17:07] for half an hour and then gets up and
[1:17:09] interprets what they think it said. That
[1:17:11] ain't going to feed me.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to feed me when they come
[1:17:15] out and try to breathe on top of people
[1:17:17] and speak on top of people and do all
[1:17:19] kind. That ain't going to feed me. That
[1:17:21] might feed somebody else when they jump
[1:17:23] all day and they can't get to the
[1:17:25] preaching of the word. That might feed
[1:17:27] somebody, but it won't feed me. I'm an
[1:17:29] eagle and I got to have an eagle, a
[1:17:32] fresh gill to be able to set here under
[1:17:35] the shadow of the wings of the Almighty.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice,
[1:17:42] hallelujah, the seventh angel, when he
[1:17:45] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[1:17:48] should be finished, completed, polished,
[1:17:52] perfect.
[1:17:54] It wasn't a whole lot about William
[1:17:56] Brandham that people thought he was
[1:17:58] polished. He said pull pit instead of
[1:18:00] pull pit. He said hit stones and hints
[1:18:03] and all kinds of different things.
[1:18:04] Didn't have a good vocabulary. He wasn't
[1:18:06] polished to the rest of the world.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; But the same one that crafted him was
[1:18:12] the same one that crafted me.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; And they want to polish up the message.
[1:18:22] They want to polish it up. and try to
[1:18:24] rub it down and smooth out all the
[1:18:26] corners of it and say we need to preach
[1:18:27] it like this. We don't need the
[1:18:28] demonstration of the power no more. All
[1:18:30] we need is an intellectual TED talk
[1:18:32] where somebody gets up and reads a few
[1:18:34] quotes here and there. But I beg to
[1:18:36] differ.
[1:18:38] I beg to differ. I say if we're going to
[1:18:40] preach a message, then there ought to be
[1:18:41] some power behind it. There ought to be
[1:18:43] some anointing behind it. This is the
[1:18:46] finishing of it. So if it's finished,
[1:18:49] then it was perfect the way that William
[1:18:52] Brandham left it.
[1:18:54] Then let's preach it just like the
[1:18:56] prophet left it under the gene seat of
[1:18:59] almighty God. We have been led to
[1:19:01] finish.
[1:19:03] To finish. Let's run with a message.
[1:19:06] We've got the answer. Run.
[1:19:10] Don't change the message. Live the
[1:19:13] message. Preach the message. Be the
[1:19:15] message.
[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:19] Hallelujah.
[1:19:21] I am challenged by the message to finish
[1:19:25] my course.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You talk about a challenge.
[1:19:42] William Brandham was challenged.
[1:19:46] to take all these loose ends
[1:19:54] time together. It's a paradox, but it's
[1:19:58] true
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; that God can tie up something and loose
[1:20:02] at the same time.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He tied these mysteries
[1:20:07] together and brought them back, but when
[1:20:10] he did, he loosed you. He loosed you to
[1:20:12] believe. He loosed you for healing. He
[1:20:14] loosed you to believe that the rapture
[1:20:16] is for you.
[1:20:18] He said, "Yeah, it's a mystery, but it's
[1:20:20] solved."
[1:20:23] Yes, it's a mystery, but it's solved.
[1:20:25] You see, it is no longer a mystery to
[1:20:27] the church of the living God. What was
[1:20:30] it? The seven thunders awaken the
[1:20:32] sleeping body that they recognize. What
[1:20:36] was it when the seven thunders uttered
[1:20:38] their voice? The symbology was broke off
[1:20:41] the scriptures and now you see Christ.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; I love what the prophet said in the
[1:20:50] guide. He said at the finishing of the
[1:20:51] seventh seal, the mystery of God should
[1:20:53] be finished. To know who God is, what he
[1:20:57] is, how he lives, his nature and his
[1:21:01] being.
[1:21:02] So the shout challenged you
[1:21:06] to press on
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; and the spoken word is the original
[1:21:10] seed. He said God is taking the elect
[1:21:11] out of that Pentecostal church that
[1:21:13] hybrid pulling it out and finishing up
[1:21:16] the word.
[1:21:18] It's got to be so close
[1:21:21] but to the world itself will blend with
[1:21:23] this word. There comes a headstone
[1:21:25] crying grace.
[1:21:28] Grace amazing grace.
[1:21:32] What is he doing?
[1:21:36] Our founder, brother Homer, come out of
[1:21:38] the Pentecostal church.
[1:21:42] But the reason why he came out because
[1:21:44] he was not a part of it.
[1:21:48] How did he get here?
[1:21:51] There's other people that was handed a
[1:21:53] message book.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; There's other people in that same church
[1:21:57] that was handing a message book, but
[1:21:59] they couldn't handle it.
[1:22:02] Let me say it like this. The Pentecostal
[1:22:04] age could not finish what God ordained
[1:22:07] for you.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; You see, they were not people of the
[1:22:10] commission. They could only go so far.
[1:22:14] But the reason why there's a church
[1:22:16] standing here and was ordained by Homer
[1:22:19] Fraser was because almighty God elected
[1:22:22] brother Homer Fraser before the
[1:22:24] foundation of the world and planted him
[1:22:26] right here in the hills of Virginia and
[1:22:28] said, "You're going to be in there, but
[1:22:30] I'm going to pull you out. I'mma pull
[1:22:33] you out of that hybrid system because
[1:22:35] why? I've got a job for you to do.
[1:22:39] You've got to finish this."
[1:22:42] But he didn't just leave it from the
[1:22:43] pull pit. He put it on you.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:22:51] Let's finish what God started.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] I feel anointed.
[1:23:01] I feel anointed to tear down strongholds
[1:23:04] and to build up the church of the living
[1:23:06] God into such a place she will believe
[1:23:09] exactly what the prophet said about her.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I believe that God ordained me to preach
[1:23:16] this message. I believe that God
[1:23:18] ordained you to believe and receive this
[1:23:20] message. I believe that God called you
[1:23:23] to come out to come out to come out.
[1:23:28] You said, "Well, I wasn't in no
[1:23:29] organization." But you still had to come
[1:23:31] out of it. Some of you had to come out
[1:23:33] of the Amish movement. Some of you had
[1:23:34] had to come out of the Catholic
[1:23:35] movement. Some of you had to come out of
[1:23:37] Baptist and Methodist and Presbyterian.
[1:23:41] But God called you to come out.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; He elected you to come out. And it shows
[1:23:47] what kind of seed that you have on the
[1:23:49] inside of you.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you came out.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:00] Hallelujah.
[1:24:03] Hallelujah.
[1:24:05] Said, "But can God do anything with me?"
[1:24:08] Sure he can.
[1:24:12] Sure he can. Remember the prophet one
[1:24:14] time he was telling a story. I'm getting
[1:24:17] ready to close.
[1:24:19] He's telling a story about the queen.
[1:24:22] She goes to this great big paper meal.
[1:24:24] She's toring the paper meal. She's
[1:24:26] looking all around and she comes to a
[1:24:28] place and the manager of the of this
[1:24:31] paper meal is standing there and the
[1:24:34] queen looks down at it and she says,
[1:24:36] "What is that mess right there?" And it
[1:24:38] was nothing but a bunch of rags laying
[1:24:40] there.
[1:24:42] He said, "Well, that's tomorrow's
[1:24:45] newspaper." She said, "You mean to tell
[1:24:47] me that that's tomorrow's newspaper?" He
[1:24:50] said, "Absolutely." and she left the
[1:24:52] building and the next night the manager
[1:24:55] of that place took those filthy rags
[1:24:58] running through his machinery and the
[1:25:00] next day he printed the queen's picture
[1:25:03] right on the front of it
[1:25:05] to prove to her that the the image is
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; the image of the queen was on filthy
[1:25:16] rags
[1:25:25] Some of you getting it.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; It ain't how you look.
[1:25:33] It ain't what you look like.
[1:25:36] But when the master gets done with you,
[1:25:38] when the master of the facility gets
[1:25:40] done writing your story, let him print
[1:25:43] his image on top of you. You may have
[1:25:46] came from a home of disgrace, but it's a
[1:25:48] message of grace that is rotten over top
[1:25:50] of your life.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah. You may not look like it
[1:25:55] right now, but let your life go through
[1:25:57] the blood of Jesus Christ, and God will
[1:25:59] take your filthy rags, and you'll be an
[1:26:02] image of Jesus Christ at the end of this
[1:26:04] age.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come.
[1:26:12] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:26:16] In 1968
[1:26:19] during the Olympic Games in Mexico City,
[1:26:22] there was a marathon runner from
[1:26:24] Tanzania. His name was John Steven
[1:26:27] Aquar. He became famous not for winning
[1:26:32] but for finishing. Early in the race, he
[1:26:35] fell badly. He dislocated his knee. He
[1:26:37] injured his shoulder. Many expected him
[1:26:40] to quit. And hours later, the stadium
[1:26:42] had nearly completely emptied. The
[1:26:45] medals had already been awarded. The
[1:26:47] lights had done been turned off. Then
[1:26:49] suddenly
[1:26:52] the crowd saw a lone figure limping
[1:26:56] wrapped in bandage bandages grimacing
[1:26:59] with every step entering the enter the
[1:27:01] arena. And the people stood there and
[1:27:03] cheered as John Steven Aquara hobbled
[1:27:07] those last painful steps and he crossed
[1:27:10] the finish line. When the reporters
[1:27:12] asked him why didn't he just quit, he
[1:27:15] gave this legendary answer. My country
[1:27:18] did not send me 5,000 miles to start the
[1:27:20] race. They sent me 5,000 miles to finish
[1:27:24] the race.
[1:27:26] God before the foundation of the world
[1:27:29] did not elect me just so I could start.
[1:27:32] He elected me
[1:27:35] to finish.
[1:27:36] [Applause]
[1:27:41] He elected me to finish.
[1:27:45] [Applause]
[1:27:48] I believe that's one of them new words,
[1:27:49] ain't it? Locked in. Is that one of them
[1:27:52] words? I get it right, India. locked in.
[1:27:57] These kids come up with new words all
[1:27:58] the time. I'm just waiting for them to
[1:28:01] say at the end of it. My sermon was RZ.
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:06] I don't even know what that stuff means.
[1:28:10] But that's what you going to have to be
[1:28:11] in this age. You going have to be locked
[1:28:12] in.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish.
[1:28:19] Matter of fact, my sermon's finished
[1:28:20] right now.
[1:28:23] What are you going to do?
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm going to do.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm going to do.
[1:28:33] There's going to come times in your life
[1:28:34] when you're going to have to make some
[1:28:35] tough decisions to be in the house of
[1:28:36] the Lord.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; But you will never regret doing anything
[1:28:43] for the house of God. That's right.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Let me say this world will fill you with
[1:28:48] all kinds of regrets, but you will never
[1:28:50] regret doing something for King Jesus.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You will never regret regret giving your
[1:28:55] all in worship. You will never regret
[1:28:58] giving all of your energies.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; You will never regret coming to church
[1:29:02] when you didn't feel like coming to
[1:29:04] church.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And I say, let's finish this with all
[1:29:08] that's what finished.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; How many's with me? How many say, "God,
[1:29:13] I I I receive this word as a challenge
[1:29:17] to run the race that you set before me,
[1:29:22] and I'm going to do my best, Lord.
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] I can't do it on my own, but I can do
[1:29:29] all things through Christ who
[1:29:31] strengthens me.
[1:29:33] I can do this. I can make it. I'mma
[1:29:37] press the battle, and I'm going to win."
[1:29:39] God bless you. God bless you.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; The castle
[1:29:50] that made between us,
[1:29:54] how high the mountain
[1:29:59] I could not fly.
[1:30:04] In desperation,
[1:30:07] [Music]
[1:30:08] I turned to heaven
[1:30:13] and spoke your name
[1:30:17] into
[1:30:19] the light.
[1:30:21] [Music]
[1:30:23] Then through the darkness,
[1:30:27] [Music]
[1:30:28] your loving kindness
[1:30:33] for through the shadow
[1:30:38] of my soul.

[1:31:02] and who could imagine
[1:31:07] so great
[1:31:09] mercy.

[1:32:42] broken every chain.
[1:32:46] There's salvation
[1:32:48] in your name, Jesus Christ,
[1:32:54] my name. Oh, can we sing that again? Oh,
[1:32:58] hallelujah.
[1:33:00] Oh, hallelujah.

[1:33:23] every chain. There's salvation
[1:33:28] in your
[1:33:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:33] my name.
[1:33:35] Oh, let's sing that one more time.
[1:33:39] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:45] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:33:50] Hallelujah.
[1:33:54] Oh, death has lost it on me. You have
[1:34:01] broken
[1:34:03] every chain. There's salvation
[1:34:08] in your name.

[1:34:24] believe, uh this evening here. So, if we
[1:34:27] want to have sister Annie and whoever
[1:34:29] would be coming, maybe dad and the
[1:34:32] brothers would pray with her.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Won't you just love the Lord?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] [Music]
[1:35:02] [Music]

[1:36:26] make sure they're ready for Sister Andy
[1:36:27] to come on back as they prepare their
[1:36:30] singing a song. Have you been to Jesus
[1:36:32] for your salvation power, cleansing
[1:36:34] power? Are you washed in the blood of
[1:36:35] the lamb?

[1:39:41] Ghost.
