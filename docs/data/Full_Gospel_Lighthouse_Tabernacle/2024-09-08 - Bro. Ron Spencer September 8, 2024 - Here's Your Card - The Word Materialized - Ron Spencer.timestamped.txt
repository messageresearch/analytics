[14:00] [Music]
[14:06] how many enjoyed that sermon last night
[14:08] amen that was just that was powerful and
[14:11] you know I was ready to fight a fight a
[14:12] buzz saw after that you know so um you
[14:16] know I had I wanted to share share
[14:18] something I know most of you know I I
[14:20] really believe in testifying and I
[14:22] believe in you guys testifying and
[14:24] testifying of what God delivers you from
[14:26] and you know here a couple weeks ago
[14:29] uh I talked to brother Ron a little bit
[14:31] about it I won't go into all the details
[14:33] but I was dealing with the situation at
[14:35] work and situation at work where we had
[14:38] we had some victims that were they were
[14:40] captives and that's not a metaphor to
[14:42] anything it's the truth they were
[14:45] captives and it it really dealt it it
[14:48] was dealing with my heart and it was it
[14:50] was heavy on my heart and I was having a
[14:51] hard time with it because we we'd sit in
[14:54] front of them and we talk to them and we
[14:57] had some that would even tell us they
[14:59] had Stockholm syndrome which is a
[15:01] medical medical name for when you become
[15:04] bound to your captor to where you
[15:07] actually feel a an attraction to your
[15:10] captor and you don't want to come and
[15:12] testify against them and that that spoke
[15:15] volumes to me and it just it really
[15:17] began to just deal with my heart and
[15:20] there's nothing we could do with them I
[15:21] could I could sit here and I could take
[15:23] them in front of the court and I could
[15:24] take the the captor in front of the
[15:26] court but it's not my testimony that's
[15:28] going to set them free it's their
[15:30] testimony that's going to set them free
[15:32] and so I went to I went to Ohio to be
[15:35] with uh be in the meetings here a couple
[15:36] weeks ago and I just felt led of the
[15:39] Lord to do that and I left early in the
[15:40] morning and about 4:00 in the morning
[15:43] God began to deal with me on that
[15:44] because it was just so heavy on my heart
[15:46] I wanted to be able to wanted to be able
[15:47] to help them and God just dropped it
[15:49] right down in my heart between 3 and
[15:51] 4:00 in the morning on the road said is
[15:54] this not the same thing that happens in
[15:56] the spiritual amen and that point it
[15:59] just turned the table on everything of
[16:01] what we deal with and I have I have the
[16:04] power to to be able to set these set
[16:06] these victims down and every criminal
[16:08] activity that they're involved in I can
[16:11] take those charges away if they just
[16:13] testify against their
[16:15] captor and we have the same power to be
[16:18] able to do that we have we have men that
[16:21] that stand here and they will preach the
[16:22] gospel and they may know exactly what
[16:24] you're what you're dealing with and you
[16:26] may come time and time again to be able
[16:28] to come again get prayed for and get
[16:29] prayed for and these men will stand and
[16:32] they can testify for you they can pray
[16:34] for you they can stand they can stand in
[16:37] front of Satan's enemy and our enemy and
[16:40] they can stand in front of Satan and you
[16:42] can be delivered but if you don't
[16:44] testify of that Satan is going to
[16:46] continue to bind you and bind you and
[16:48] bind you and you'll go back to him and
[16:51] so as he as as the Lord begin to help me
[16:54] with that he helped me understand
[16:55] exactly what we deal with to where when
[16:57] we pray for somebody and when you pray
[16:59] for somebody and when you become
[17:01] delivered of something you must testify
[17:04] because it's your testimony that's going
[17:06] to bind the enemy so he cannot come back
[17:08] to afflict you let's just take these
[17:10] needs back to the
[17:12] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're
[17:15] just so thankful to be able to come and
[17:16] be here this morning and be able to come
[17:19] and be in an atmosphere that this is
[17:21] more than just a gathering of people
[17:23] this is more than just another church
[17:25] service and Lord I I speak to many
[17:28] people all the time and speak to them
[17:29] about their churches and they have
[17:31] Gatherings and and truly they go and
[17:33] they worship the one and true Living God
[17:35] Jesus Christ but Lord Jesus we have a
[17:38] message that has brought us forth and
[17:40] brought us into a living open word that
[17:42] we don't have to second guess where we
[17:44] go to or second guess whether is this
[17:46] right or is this wrong we have we have
[17:49] Malachi 4 the prophet of Elijah that's
[17:51] came and you spoke through him and Lord
[17:54] Jesus we hear each and every one of
[17:55] these prayer requests you see sister Pat
[17:57] there that just went through the surgery
[17:59] and I'm believing they the doctors were
[18:01] able to go in and take every cancerous
[18:02] cell out and that will be the end of
[18:04] that fight but Lord Jesus we know that
[18:06] there's healing and we know life is what
[18:08] brings the healing and you give us that
[18:10] life and Lord Brother JD whitson's
[18:12] grandson there and we see sister Katie
[18:14] ktie and Hunter as they've just had
[18:16] their baby and how Satan will just
[18:17] attack and he'll try to attack the lives
[18:19] of these little children because he
[18:21] knows that he knows that he's coming
[18:23] towards his end and and as these lives
[18:25] come forth it's it's just one more last
[18:27] seed coming in before his time is up and
[18:30] Lord Jesus as he attacks the children
[18:31] and as he attacks the children of you
[18:33] Lord Jesus I pray that you could just
[18:35] come and just put a hedge of protection
[18:37] around each and every one of us Lord and
[18:39] I just pray that you could just come and
[18:41] no matter what we're battling with no
[18:43] matter even if we think that we are
[18:44] loving the life that we are in and
[18:46] loving the sin that we're in we are just
[18:48] we are just Bound by a captor that that
[18:50] Lord you have the power over top of and
[18:53] I pray that you would just be able to
[18:54] deliver each and every one of us this
[18:56] morning even if we don't understand the
[18:58] the sermons that come forth that may f
[19:00] as they're cutting and we may enjoy the
[19:02] life that we're living and may enjoy the
[19:04] things that we're doing and may not
[19:06] completely understand exactly exactly
[19:08] why we have to stop doing that and we
[19:10] hear it and we hear it and we hear it
[19:11] over and over again I pray that you
[19:13] would just apply the the bomb of Gilead
[19:16] over top of us whether it's a healing
[19:18] whether it's it's eyes opening to the
[19:20] word there's people here Lord that I
[19:22] believe have real Deliverance that is
[19:23] needed and their eyes need to become
[19:25] open and healing needs to come forth and
[19:27] Lord Jesus I I believe that this can be
[19:29] the morning of that this can be the
[19:31] morning that that souls are delivered
[19:33] and and even as even as sermons would be
[19:35] preached and in in back in the day where
[19:38] sermons would be preached and souls
[19:39] would fall down in the street because
[19:41] they felt the presence of the Lord I
[19:43] believe that all across the service and
[19:44] the streaming of the internet and the
[19:46] ones here that come I pray that just
[19:49] surrendered Hearts will come before you
[19:50] this morning that that we could just
[19:52] come and we could just give our life to
[19:54] you and and then we could take and we
[19:56] could bind the enemy this morning bind
[19:58] the enemy from everything that he's
[19:59] tried to tried to afflict us of that we
[20:01] may become Overcomers because we know
[20:04] that we are Overcomers by the blood of
[20:06] the lamb and the word of Our Testimony
[20:07] Lord and I just pray that you would come

[32:33] oh I can't
[32:37] forget the way my old life used to

[32:50] bound
[32:52] oh and I spent all my days you see I
[32:58] poured my whole life without
[33:01] measure into a little treasure box I
[33:07] thought I

[33:13] oh until the day when Jesus came to me
[33:20] you see he healed my
[33:23] soul with the Wonder of him is
[33:29] touch so now I'm giving back to
[33:34] him all the praise he's worthy of you
[33:39] see I've been
[33:42] forgiven and that's
[33:44] why oh I love him
[33:51] so and I've come to Pour

[34:31] hair you were
[34:36] there the night Jesus found
[34:40] [Music]
[34:41] me and you did not feel what I felt when
[34:47] he wrapped his loving arms around me no

[34:58] of the
[35:01] oil

[35:56] cost pour it out
[35:59] your cost might be different than
[36:00] somebody else's but just pour it out on
[36:03] him because he's worthy of it all am man
[36:05] we'd like for you to just stand with us
[36:07] at this time get ready to change order
[36:09] the service we have a uh few things to
[36:12] do this morning and and uh just want to
[36:15] prepare our hearts and just uh it's the
[36:18] Lord's laid it on our hearts here to uh
[36:21] have a prayer line after service today
[36:23] after the preaching of the word and so
[36:25] if you've never been in in a prayer line
[36:28] we'll maybe after brother Ron speaks
[36:30] today we'll just kind of go over those
[36:32] things but I just wanted to make that
[36:33] mention to you just to prepare your
[36:36] hearts while the preaching of the word
[36:37] is going forth and and just to just drop
[36:40] this in just now if you've never been in
[36:43] a prayer line if you never come to an
[36:44] altar just hold something in your heart
[36:47] and sometimes you don't even really
[36:49] understand why you're getting in a
[36:50] prayer line you maybe not find anything
[36:52] but maybe it's for somebody else and
[36:55] just because you get in line you can
[36:56] watch something take place and not
[36:59] saying that you have to get in a prayer
[37:00] line not saying you have to do those
[37:02] things but sometimes just people going
[37:04] through not not didn't even know it some
[37:06] of the greatest Miracles I've personally
[37:08] heard of is because somebody else went
[37:10] through the line not knowing what they
[37:12] were going through for but it was for
[37:14] somebody else so just just prepare your
[37:16] heart for those things today and sing

[50:53] special it is brother Kalin sing from
[50:56] from South
[50:58] Africa wrote me this morning and he's
[51:01] quite a wonderful fellow but he wot
[51:04] wrote me this morning
[51:06] and and uh he actually wrote my
[51:10] text this
[51:12] morning told me he was praying for me
[51:16] and that text is the word
[51:21] materialized that's more than a
[51:24] coincidence and I thought God is just
[51:27] telling us he's going to be with us
[51:28] today and and so I'd like to read this
[51:31] text for you in Isaiah chapter 55 and
[51:35] verse 7 God bless you brother kayin as
[51:38] well he'll be he may be watching even
[51:42] now brother George Quinn is going to be
[51:45] with us on our fall festival and he'll
[51:47] be speaking on Saturday night I know
[51:49] he's watching and God bless you brother
[51:52] George we love him with all of his heart
[51:54] his daughter is coming amen
[51:57] and uh she has got time off to be able
[52:00] to come and it's been her dream to come
[52:03] to this place and so you sisters I want
[52:06] you to make her feel as comfortable as
[52:08] she can be and so I know you will that's
[52:11] just what you do and so don't think it
[52:14] it's that's just just going to just by
[52:17] chance happen again over and over like
[52:19] brother George she can't do it every
[52:21] year and so let's take advantage of that
[52:24] time make friends with her and if you
[52:26] will do that Isaiah 55 and verse
[52:29] 7 let the wicked forsake his way and the
[52:35] unrighteous man his
[52:37] thoughts and let him return unto the
[52:39] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[52:42] and to our God for he will abundantly
[52:46] pardon for my thoughts are not your
[52:50] thoughts and neither are your ways my
[52:53] ways sayeth the Lord for as the heaven
[52:56] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[53:00] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[53:03] than your
[53:04] thoughts 2 Corinthians CH 5 and verse
[53:09] 14 for the Lord of Christ constrain us
[53:13] because we thus judge that if one died
[53:18] for
[53:19] all then we are all
[53:22] dead and that he died for all
[53:27] that they which live should not
[53:29] henceforth live unto
[53:32] themselves but unto him which dieth for
[53:35] them and rose again wherefore henceforth
[53:39] know we no man after the
[53:41] flesh yay though we have known Christ
[53:45] after the flesh that now henceforth know
[53:48] we know him no more therefore If any man
[53:52] be in Christ he is a new creature
[53:56] let's read the scripture together
[53:58] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[54:02] a new creature old things are passed
[54:06] away and behold All Things become new
[54:11] amen God bless you as you're seated
[54:15] today I want to read The Lord's Prayer
[54:17] if you'll read that with me just
[54:22] now after this manner pray ye
[54:27] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[54:31] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[54:35] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[54:39] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[54:41] our debts as we forgive our debtors and
[54:44] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[54:47] Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom
[54:50] and the power and the glory forever
[54:54] amen the next verse says for if we
[54:56] forgive men their
[54:58] trespasses your heavenly father will
[55:01] also forgive you amen I want you greet
[55:05] your neighbor beside of you and say
[55:07] welcome to the house of the Lord God
[55:09] bless you amen God bless you amen I look
[55:14] up and see new faces here I I didn't I'm

[55:21] Lord amen God bless you always brother
[55:23] Roger and sister an amen man we we're
[55:27] buddies from a long time ago now last
[55:29] night I would have preached that if IID
[55:31] have thought of
[55:40] it I been an individual that has loved
[55:44] boxing I've absolutely loved boxing
[55:47] throughout life and I'll never forget
[55:50] I'll never forget
[55:52] that don't hold that against
[55:54] me but now I box against the
[56:00] devil I'll never forget being at the
[56:02] same hotel with brother Harold Hilder
[56:04] brand I was a young man at that time and
[56:07] I don't know we wasn't married just a
[56:09] couple years I don't know if we had
[56:10] children at that time and so anyway I
[56:13] walked out and there's the there's the
[56:15] leading speaker of the meeting and he's
[56:17] standing with his foot on the rail it
[56:19] was it was so back into the day that's
[56:21] when we had we had we had those outside
[56:24] rails and you the outside doors and and
[56:27] so I I walked out and there he stood and
[56:30] so I felt just Abol absolutely
[56:33] privileged to be standing there and talk
[56:34] to him I don't I didn't know at that
[56:36] time we're going to be lifetime
[56:38] friends and so I walked out beside of
[56:42] him and I just begin to greet him and
[56:44] talk to him and and he just looked over
[56:46] at me and he said do you like
[56:51] boxing I'm not expecting the the speaker
[56:55] of the meeting to talk to me about
[56:59] boxing and so from that point we became
[57:02] Bosom Buddies and and I would preach his
[57:05] meeting from 2000 until last year and
[57:10] and he went on to be with the Lord and
[57:12] he was quite a quite a quite a boxer
[57:14] himself and so you know we had a
[57:17] wonderful time in life and and uh and we
[57:21] would talk about boxing a whole lot and
[57:23] even in his days to where that he was so
[57:25] weak
[57:27] he could take you by the hands and put
[57:28] you on the floor he was a very strong
[57:31] man and we just enjoyed one another's
[57:34] company last night brother brother
[57:37] Andrew was speaking and and he was
[57:39] talking about Sugar Ray Leonard and and
[57:42] Thomas Hearns fighting and Thomas Hearns
[57:45] had basically beat him for 14 rounds had
[57:47] literally wrecked him for 14
[57:51] rounds let me just share this with you
[57:54] brother David Kegley heard the sermon
[57:56] one time and I was talking about Sugar
[57:58] Ray
[57:59] Leonard this is actually one of the
[58:01] gloves that Sugar Ray Leonard
[58:07] used I like
[58:14] it and he gave it to me after that after
[58:18] that the cancer had had struck us and
[58:23] and he said brother Ronnie said I want
[58:25] you to always know that that you're a
[58:27] fighter you're an absolute fighter and
[58:30] so and so he he was a he's a wonderful
[58:34] fellow Brother David Kegley I don't know
[58:35] if he'll hear of this today he goes to
[58:37] brother Wayne La Lawson's church and he
[58:41] said I want you to fight with all of
[58:44] your hearts and every time that you look
[58:46] at this glove remember you're a
[58:50] fighter and we have been in a battle for
[58:53] for just about four years and
[58:56] brother Kelly
[58:58] hildbrandt came to preach and and so God
[59:02] had spoke to me that week and he spoke
[59:04] to me as to speak a sermon on don't
[59:07] worry I this is before cancer we even
[59:10] had a thought of cancer and said just
[59:12] don't
[59:13] worry and brother Kelly was scheduled to
[59:17] be here and his brother came and he
[59:19] actually got here a day early and
[59:21] brother Kelly had got on flight even the
[59:24] same day and he actually
[59:26] spent three days trying to get here and
[59:30] if you remember I told you then as an
[59:33] audience I told you I said whatever
[59:35] Brother Kelly's got to say to us the
[59:38] devil is trying to block
[59:40] it you remember that the devil's trying
[59:43] to block him from saying what God has
[59:46] laid on his heart and so so anyway
[59:50] brother Kelly came and if you'll
[59:51] remember Brother Kelly's such a he's
[59:53] such a
[59:54] gentleman I don't know if I'll have that
[59:56] that good a personality even when I get
[59:58] to
[1:00:00] heaven and so anyway you you know it it
[1:00:04] just isn't fair that some guys are so
[1:00:06] sweet and so kind and so gentle I try to
[1:00:10] do all of that but well here we
[1:00:13] are and brother Kelly comes and and he
[1:00:16] comes to the pull pit he's been all day
[1:00:19] traveling and he comes to the pull pit
[1:00:21] and he he gives me a coin and it's
[1:00:24] really special to me I have it on my
[1:00:26] desk at
[1:00:27] home he doesn't know but he's felt led
[1:00:31] to give me a coin that says we will
[1:00:34] accept
[1:00:36] nothing less than full
[1:00:39] Victory let me remember
[1:00:42] that and on the there was there's a
[1:00:46] piece of sand brother Roger I'm glad
[1:00:48] you're here this morning there's a piece
[1:00:50] of sand it comes from the
[1:00:52] Normandy
[1:00:54] Beach now now what that means to me is
[1:00:58] we had a Believer here brother Roger
[1:01:00] your Uncle
[1:01:02] Max and Max Max was quite a he's quite a
[1:01:07] wonderful man how many remember brother
[1:01:09] Max I'm actually preaching now so you
[1:01:12] know you it's counting in my minutes so
[1:01:15] it's going to be all right and so
[1:01:18] brother Max had been in on he had
[1:01:20] actually been at this battle and brother
[1:01:24] Max said that
[1:01:26] he said that he said I I was placed to
[1:01:30] where that I would I would come off of
[1:01:32] those boats and we would hit the ground
[1:01:35] running and we would be in the water and
[1:01:38] he said he said just thousands of us was
[1:01:41] hitting the water at the same time and
[1:01:43] he said he said my comrades were falling
[1:01:48] and the water turned
[1:01:50] red I don't think we could talk about
[1:01:52] how devastating it was and he's running
[1:01:55] and he said I was thinking I'll die any
[1:01:57] second and he's running in the water
[1:02:00] bullets are flying bombs are dropping
[1:02:04] and they're they're fighting against
[1:02:06] those those great those great big big
[1:02:09] shooting guns that are up on the hill
[1:02:11] that Germany had built as a fortress
[1:02:15] nobody thought they'd ever win the war
[1:02:17] but they were running into the sand and
[1:02:19] he said there was men laying all over
[1:02:21] the beach and he said said we were
[1:02:23] running and he said I thought well I'm
[1:02:25] going to die any second and he said I
[1:02:28] made it to the
[1:02:30] wall he said brother Ryan I I never I
[1:02:34] never knew why that I made
[1:02:40] it one of the last nights that brother
[1:02:42] Max was ever
[1:02:45] here and he had to go he had to go to
[1:02:47] the Veteran's Home CU he was since in
[1:02:50] such bad shape he got so forgetful and
[1:02:53] his mind began but he would would come
[1:02:56] up and at the sometimes in the service
[1:02:59] and he would come and sit behind beside
[1:03:01] of me any of you ever remember that I
[1:03:05] always thought that was so
[1:03:07] special you know to me that was just so
[1:03:11] special and he' come and he would lay
[1:03:13] his hand on my leg and he'd say brother
[1:03:15] Ron I love
[1:03:18] you and one night I preached on
[1:03:21] predestination how God has watched over
[1:03:23] your
[1:03:24] life you may have been in a war you may
[1:03:27] have been in a tough thing and you may
[1:03:29] have been in difficult moments but God
[1:03:32] preserved your
[1:03:35] life and he he came and laid his hand on
[1:03:38] my leg and he said tonight for the first
[1:03:41] time I know why God preserved me to
[1:03:46] serve
[1:03:50] himall to serve him I don't know if you
[1:03:53] know it but God preserved your
[1:03:57] life he preserved your life to preserve
[1:04:03] [Applause]
[1:04:07] you brother Tom Hill would you stand if
[1:04:09] you will just for a
[1:04:11] moment brother Tom had a desire on his
[1:04:15] heart to buy me a rifle it was a special
[1:04:19] rifle and it would have my name on it
[1:04:22] and it would have a lot of things on it
[1:04:24] in gold
[1:04:27] and you know brother Tom's a wonderful
[1:04:32] man and he's got that nature like
[1:04:35] brother
[1:04:36] Kelly and he he wanted to do it for
[1:04:39] me but I knew the cost of that and I I I
[1:04:45] I knew it would cost a lot of
[1:04:47] money and I would tell him no no brother
[1:04:50] Tom maybe a year or so you had that on
[1:04:53] your heart I'd hold him off I'd say
[1:04:56] brother Tom no I I I I you know there's
[1:05:00] there's a lot of other things that you
[1:05:01] can do with that kind of
[1:05:03] money and so I told him you know please
[1:05:06] don't do
[1:05:09] that we got the diagnosis of
[1:05:13] cancer that it had it in our lungs at
[1:05:15] that point and in our lymph
[1:05:19] nodes
[1:05:21] and and it was quite it's quite
[1:05:24] overwhelming you know you know sometimes
[1:05:26] you get a test and you worry about will
[1:05:28] you get it or not but when they actually
[1:05:30] tell you you got it it takes another
[1:05:33] level we're going to announce this as a
[1:05:36] as a as to our body of
[1:05:38] Believers I've stood here with you now
[1:05:41] all these years and I think at that
[1:05:43] point about 20
[1:05:46] years brother Andrew was sitting over
[1:05:48] here but before
[1:05:51] service before service brother Tom
[1:05:53] knocks on the back door
[1:05:57] and I think one of the boys was with us
[1:05:59] and Brother Sam how fitting this is
[1:06:03] they're getting married next Friday amen
[1:06:07] hallelujah and so he and Kaylee are just
[1:06:10] special people and so anyway he knocks
[1:06:14] on the door
[1:06:15] and he knocks on the door and he walks
[1:06:18] in and he's got a David
[1:06:21] slink amen
[1:06:34] and we've just had the discussion of how
[1:06:36] we've got to announce this to this
[1:06:39] audience and here comes brother
[1:06:43] Tom and he's got this
[1:06:47] swing and he said brother Ron I you
[1:06:50] wouldn't let me buy that gun for
[1:06:52] you but I bought this sling
[1:06:56] for
[1:06:59] you and if you'll remember I I waved it
[1:07:03] over this
[1:07:05] audience I promised you as a body of
[1:07:07] Believers that I'd do my
[1:07:13] best many other things would happen and
[1:07:16] the Lord would speak to me December the
[1:07:19] 22nd if you'll trust
[1:07:22] me I'll use you like never never
[1:07:27] before how many remember
[1:07:29] that I'm talking to you about the word
[1:07:33] materializing it's not
[1:07:37] squirrels maybe it's not
[1:07:39] storms but God wants to take your life
[1:07:43] and let you
[1:07:45] see I'm with
[1:07:47] you I'm with you in your storms I'm with
[1:07:50] you in your battles
[1:07:58] you know I've had my critics do
[1:08:00] this I've been told many times it was a
[1:08:03] cursed on my
[1:08:05] life you know that comes kind of
[1:08:09] difficult the difficult part is brother
[1:08:11] Chris the difficult part is you've
[1:08:13] watched
[1:08:15] God God God through this for months
[1:08:18] before it happened and he was prepping
[1:08:21] us for it I've watched doctors
[1:08:25] I've watched doctors be the best that
[1:08:27] they could be and I've had a phenomenal
[1:08:29] team of doctors now we're four years
[1:08:32] down the line and I sat with a doctor
[1:08:34] last week with sister Connie listen
[1:08:36] those doctors have gave me a lot of
[1:08:38] difficult news through this four years
[1:08:42] you'll you'll not live listen the first
[1:08:44] doctor that came in and told me my life
[1:08:47] expectancy she sat down down on the bed
[1:08:49] and she said she said Connie was laying
[1:08:52] in the bed she was asleep on the next
[1:08:55] place and she was asleep and this doctor
[1:08:57] came in and they were going to brain
[1:08:59] surgery tomorrow and she told me she
[1:09:01] said I want you to understand we'll do
[1:09:04] our best and she said understand she
[1:09:07] said even at our best to try to help you
[1:09:10] about four
[1:09:12] months and they told me to get my
[1:09:15] Affairs in
[1:09:16] order they told me we would have to do
[1:09:19] two different types of chemo and then
[1:09:22] the first chemo that they gave me didn't
[1:09:25] work and and then the second type of
[1:09:27] chemo and two different types that I
[1:09:29] take every
[1:09:30] day because I believe God's with doctors
[1:09:33] and I believe God's with with medicine I
[1:09:36] believe with all of that and so listen I
[1:09:40] as a man realize my
[1:09:43] position but let me let me just say this
[1:09:45] to you in all of this we have inspired
[1:09:50] thousands of
[1:09:53] people to fight this battle
[1:09:56] and I want to say this you I've tried to
[1:09:58] be the best Christian that I know how to
[1:10:00] be I've tried to face every day with
[1:10:03] confidence and faith and and and I've
[1:10:06] tried not to be a whiny
[1:10:09] box listen I've I've had days where I
[1:10:12] couldn't get out of bed I've had days to
[1:10:14] where I I throwed up most of the day
[1:10:16] I've had days where my head hurt so bad
[1:10:18] I couldn't stand it I've had days and
[1:10:20] even now have days to where I don't have
[1:10:22] any
[1:10:23] strength but I've tried to to be a real
[1:10:26] representative of the cause of Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ because this
[1:10:32] word this word's got to take on
[1:10:36] flesh and if God wants somebody that he
[1:10:40] can have confidence in that can face
[1:10:45] cancer that can face cancer listen last
[1:10:48] year when I spoke at brother Ed hammer
[1:10:51] meisters in Edmonton it hit me in the
[1:10:53] pull pit God has to have somebody that
[1:10:56] can look at
[1:10:59] cancer and can overcome
[1:11:12] it listen we don't know what the end of
[1:11:14] the trial would be like it's in the
[1:11:16] hands of God I don't worry about it I I
[1:11:19] try not to think about it I try not to
[1:11:21] dwell on
[1:11:23] it but listen he's me four
[1:11:27] years and I've enjoyed my boys I've
[1:11:30] enjoyed my family I've enjoyed you as a
[1:11:32] body of
[1:11:35] Believers I'm just delivering my heart
[1:11:37] here for a little
[1:11:41] bit thank you Lord but in spite of that
[1:11:43] in spite of all of that there's been
[1:11:46] people that have railed and set a lot of
[1:11:49] things
[1:11:51] overseas here in the
[1:11:53] states and I want to put put this to
[1:11:56] bed I just want to put this to bed and
[1:11:59] I'll tell you why I want to put it to
[1:12:00] bed cuz God spoke to
[1:12:02] me you can't put anything to bed until
[1:12:05] God spoke to me here recently someone
[1:12:08] called me and and began to tell
[1:12:10] me how cursed I
[1:12:17] was listen I had people with me and I I
[1:12:20] went to a private place but after I saw
[1:12:23] that that this this is the way it was
[1:12:25] going to go I thought I'm going to have
[1:12:27] a
[1:12:29] witness steep back into a place that I
[1:12:31] had a witness and I asked them to listen
[1:12:35] and this individual was telling me how
[1:12:37] cursed that I was and laughing because I
[1:12:39] had
[1:12:44] cancer I just asked him did you feel
[1:12:46] better do you feel
[1:12:48] better come
[1:12:50] on and I hung up
[1:13:01] this
[1:13:03] week this week I couldn't sleep and
[1:13:06] that's been a few that's been weeks
[1:13:09] ago I just I gave it to God I just I
[1:13:12] gave all that to God I don't dwell on
[1:13:15] that but this week I couldn't sleep one
[1:13:21] night and I was just laying there my
[1:13:24] blood pressure was quite
[1:13:26] high no Rhyme or
[1:13:29] Reason and I
[1:13:33] just I was just laying there and it was

[1:13:57] prophet what are you saying to me so I
[1:14:00] went into my office and I was sitting in
[1:14:03] my office and he directed me to a
[1:14:06] certain thought in the
[1:14:08] message now I want to just turn just for
[1:14:10] a moment brother Brandon was having a
[1:14:12] prayer
[1:14:13] line he was having a prayer line and and
[1:14:17] there's a man came and brother brandham
[1:14:19] had a lot of
[1:14:21] critics and so I just want to put this
[1:14:23] out here brother had a lot of
[1:14:26] critics can you think of all the
[1:14:29] good that brother brandham his ministry
[1:14:35] did I can't fathom the good that his
[1:14:38] ministry did yet still had
[1:14:42] critics still had critics I mean people
[1:14:46] the dead was raised cancers were gone
[1:14:50] phenomenal
[1:14:52] Miracles
[1:14:53] 8800 people people
[1:14:56] documented Miracles that
[1:14:59] happened listen it only takes two to
[1:15:01] become the
[1:15:02] pope come on think about that two
[1:15:06] miracles to become the
[1:15:08] pope and listen in five minutes in the
[1:15:13] prayer lines with brother
[1:15:17] brandham are you with me your name your
[1:15:20] address that's right listen that's the
[1:15:22] god that we represent I want you to
[1:15:25] remember God's not
[1:15:30] dead he's not dead listen the same
[1:15:34] message that God listen the important
[1:15:37] one in that picture is that Pillar of
[1:15:41] Fire and whether you can see it or not
[1:15:44] he's
[1:15:47] [Applause]
[1:15:50] here at
[1:15:52] 2:32 so I walked in and I begin to
[1:15:55] be taken to a certain spot brother
[1:15:58] brandham is praying he's come toward the
[1:16:00] end of the prayer line and a man comes
[1:16:03] up brother R takes him by the hand and
[1:16:06] he said you're a well
[1:16:08] man and that man turns and he to the
[1:16:11] audience and he said see see my card my
[1:16:16] card says
[1:16:18] TB on and brother Brandon's reeling
[1:16:21] because he's so weak you've heard it
[1:16:23] many times he's reeling because he's too
[1:16:27] weak and he and brother Bram takes him
[1:16:29] by the hand again and he says you're a
[1:16:32] well
[1:16:33] man you're a well
[1:16:37] man listen you're not playing with a
[1:16:41] man listen when we come here we're not
[1:16:44] playing with a
[1:16:46] man and he says you're a well man and he
[1:16:49] said my card says TB you can get the
[1:16:52] quote and I'm just paraphrasing now and
[1:16:54] he said what you have wrote on the
[1:16:57] card you now
[1:17:00] have the scripture says touch not my
[1:17:03] anointing do my prophets no
[1:17:14] harm I'm more than an officer of the
[1:17:18] church I'm a Son of God that has
[1:17:22] represented this message since
[1:17:30] 1983 I want you to be
[1:17:33] careful I'm talking to the world I want
[1:17:36] you to be careful what you call a
[1:17:43] curse here's your card
[1:17:56] I want you to make that the title so we
[1:18:00] can easily find
[1:18:02] that subtitle
[1:18:04] it the word m
[1:18:12] materialized you want to bring that
[1:18:13] other
[1:18:19] piece we went to Brother Tom
[1:18:22] Ray to preach the meting me this
[1:18:25] year it's a youth meeting it's also
[1:18:28] their church
[1:18:29] meeting it's in a tent it's quite a
[1:18:32] large meeting how many you would you
[1:18:33] think was
[1:18:35] there 5 600
[1:18:38] people
[1:18:41] and and
[1:18:44] so anyway they don't tell us what the
[1:18:47] theme of the meeting
[1:18:52] is they don't tell us what the theme of
[1:18:54] them meeting is but God laid it on my
[1:18:58] heart and Andrew probably preached the
[1:19:00] best for services I've ever heard him
[1:19:04] preach I sat there and marveled I never
[1:19:07] heard those sermons preached before but
[1:19:09] I sat there and Marvel at what he said
[1:19:12] and God just came along behind it
[1:19:14] service after service and Vindicated the
[1:19:17] word over and over again and that's to
[1:19:20] God be the
[1:19:22] glory and so and so anyway anyway I went
[1:19:26] there and God had dealt with me for
[1:19:28] months because in
[1:19:32] 1986 I was sitting in the meeting and
[1:19:35] maybe some of you were there brother
[1:19:36] bisco preached a meeting and he preached
[1:19:39] a meeting called let us
[1:19:42] run was any of you in sitting in the
[1:19:45] meeting you was I I'm glad you were
[1:19:48] there with
[1:19:51] me brother Gabriel would you I know it's
[1:19:54] posted on the internet in a couple
[1:19:57] places but would you repost that let us
[1:20:00] run and so anyway I was sitting there as
[1:20:04] a young
[1:20:05] Minister and I was so inspired by that
[1:20:09] sermon until I committed my
[1:20:13] life like never before to this message
[1:20:17] and listen I've been a lot of places in
[1:20:20] the world I've been I've been all over
[1:20:22] the world but but let let me just say
[1:20:24] this to you I go back to that sermon to
[1:20:27] where that I committed the rest of my
[1:20:30] life to this message and to Jesus
[1:20:34] Christ and listen I knew that I was to
[1:20:38] spend all of my energies to preach this
[1:20:40] message with everything that was within
[1:20:43] me and so I go back I go back when I get
[1:20:47] into a tight spot I go back to where he
[1:20:50] ignited me to preach this message with
[1:20:54] every everything that was within me well
[1:20:57] they knew that as a family that that's
[1:20:59] where basically I got my
[1:21:01] start and so brother bisco's daughter is
[1:21:05] named Marilyn and she's been a
[1:21:07] phenomenal artist been a phenomenal
[1:21:10] artist all of her life and so incredible
[1:21:13] works well I always thought that I'd
[1:21:16] like to have a a a piece of her work in
[1:21:20] my home now I've got pictures for she
[1:21:24] did did some
[1:21:25] work and so one night after service and
[1:21:28] I had preached let us
[1:21:31] run they said we want to have a meeting
[1:21:34] with you so we had went to we'd went to
[1:21:36] supper after the service and God had
[1:21:39] moved in an incredible way and sister
[1:21:41] Cony had actually went to our room and
[1:21:44] she was wore out and so brother Tom said
[1:21:46] you got to come and
[1:21:49] so all of the Bisal family was
[1:21:53] there and they presented me
[1:21:58] this and I'm not going to pass it along
[1:22:00] around cuz it's it's too
[1:22:04] fragile this is Brother bis's
[1:22:08] hand they did a wax mole of brother
[1:22:11] bis's
[1:22:13] hand because brother bisc preached a
[1:22:15] sermon called let us
[1:22:19] run and he this is an this this
[1:22:23] has Hebrew
[1:22:26] 12
[1:22:27] verse1 and that scripture tells us lay
[1:22:30] aside every weight and the sin was does
[1:22:32] so easily beset you and let us run the
[1:22:36] race that is set before you it's got
[1:22:39] some other special inscriptions on
[1:22:42] it
[1:22:44] and they put brother bis's hand in wax
[1:22:49] and he said I'll do that for brother
[1:22:52] Ron and so I I I'll just share this with
[1:22:57] you we didn't know how we was going to
[1:22:59] get it through the
[1:23:02] border now he's giving it to me and it's
[1:23:04] a special present but how do we get this
[1:23:07] through the
[1:23:09] border so I came to one of the
[1:23:12] officers and he was looking at it and he
[1:23:14] said give me a title to what it
[1:23:19] is he said what is
[1:23:22] that and it just hit me
[1:23:25] I said that's a Lifetime Achievement
[1:23:40] Award that officer grabbed me and he
[1:23:42] hugged
[1:23:44] me I'll guarantee it's not a person
[1:23:47] another person all day got hugged by
[1:23:49] that
[1:23:52] officer he said I met a speci special
[1:23:54] man today a
[1:23:58] preacher that received a Lifetime
[1:24:01] Achievement Award I'm telling that for
[1:24:04] the first time so there we are and so
[1:24:07] Hallelujah I think it's a special
[1:24:13] honor I want to say this to
[1:24:17] you I want to hear him say
[1:24:41] well
[1:24:43] done maybe the new ones Among Us don't
[1:24:45] know exactly what all God's done in our
[1:24:48] lives
[1:24:51] but we've had a very special life
[1:24:57] I've always
[1:25:00] prayed that I have the love of
[1:25:05] Jesus and if anything that you could
[1:25:07] feel from me I want you to feel the love
[1:25:10] of Jesus
[1:25:12] Christ in this
[1:25:15] audience you mind if I preach just a
[1:25:17] little bit
[1:25:21] now brother brandham says this he said
[1:25:24] to the right mental attitude you'll not
[1:25:28] get anywhere without the right mental
[1:25:31] attitude the right mental attitude
[1:25:34] toward any Divine promise of god notice
[1:25:37] these next words will bring it to
[1:25:43] pass we'll bring it to
[1:25:45] pass and if you'll take the right mental
[1:25:48] attitude towards any promise in the
[1:25:52] Bible it'll bring it to
[1:25:55] pass I want us to read that together and
[1:25:58] I'll lead you one verse one couple words
[1:26:00] at a time and I want you to say it the
[1:26:03] right mental
[1:26:05] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[1:26:11] God will bring it to
[1:26:15] pass if you'll take the right mental
[1:26:20] attitude towards any promise in that
[1:26:23] Bible
[1:26:26] it'll bring it to
[1:26:29] pass another place and from that time
[1:26:31] brother brandom said if Jesus was here
[1:26:34] tonight I want you to catch these words
[1:26:37] if Jesus was here tonight wearing this
[1:26:42] suit he could not heal
[1:26:46] you listen closely now you ministers
[1:26:50] Divine Healing salvation anything that
[1:26:53] was included in the
[1:26:54] atonement is a past
[1:26:57] tense listen he was wounded for our
[1:27:04] transgressions he said past tense and
[1:27:07] with his stripes we were
[1:27:12] healed can you say this it's already
[1:27:15] done
[1:27:28] Sissy's to Whitney's to have a procedure
[1:27:31] tomorrow an operation tomorrow I want to
[1:27:33] tell you personally from this P pit It's
[1:27:36] Already
[1:27:46] Done brother BR said but see instead of
[1:27:49] a human
[1:27:51] being it was a super super super human
[1:27:56] being and that's what makes human being
[1:28:00] now not only human being but he's a son
[1:28:04] and daughter of
[1:28:05] God the super super super super life
[1:28:10] that was in him comes back and wants to
[1:28:13] live in you than
[1:28:16] lord it's more than your
[1:28:19] Humanity but it's the god that's in you
[1:28:23] and when that God is in
[1:28:25] you there's nothing
[1:28:29] impossible I want you to say that with
[1:28:32] you the god that is in
[1:28:34] you there's nothing
[1:28:39] impossible there's nothing
[1:28:48] impossible quoting to scripture it is
[1:28:50] the spirit that quickeneth the flesh
[1:28:54] propit nothing the words that I speak
[1:28:56] unto you they are spirit and they are
[1:28:59] life this Bible's got to come to life
[1:29:02] and then he begins to quote the word
[1:29:04] itself is Spirit and the spirit in word
[1:29:08] form then you see when it is quickened
[1:29:11] or brought to life the spirit of the
[1:29:14] word goes to
[1:29:15] work and it acts and because now here a
[1:29:20] thought has to be a thought before it
[1:29:23] can be a word word and then when a
[1:29:26] thought is presented it is the word now
[1:29:30] this is the God's thought that he placed
[1:29:35] in the word and then when he received it
[1:29:38] from him it becomes the
[1:29:42] word these are more than just
[1:29:48] thoughts billions of people have had
[1:29:50] this in their hands but because you are
[1:29:54] who you
[1:29:56] are catch this now because you are who
[1:30:00] you
[1:30:01] are when it goes across your
[1:30:08] lips it becomes
[1:30:12] omnipotent it becomes so powerful
[1:30:15] there's not a devil in
[1:30:18] hell listen Satan's in trouble with a
[1:30:21] real son and daughter of God takes this
[1:30:24] word and comes across their
[1:30:27] lips it shakes the kingdom of
[1:30:36] hell it's pretty
[1:30:39] powerful prove it brother Ron Joshua
[1:30:42] stopped the
[1:30:45] sun Moses stretched his Rod out across
[1:30:50] the Red Sea
[1:30:54] it's unfathomable how many things happen
[1:30:57] in brother brandom's
[1:31:01] meetings
[1:31:06] squirrels it's more than a
[1:31:09] story it's more than a story oh that you
[1:31:12] know that was just a hunting story
[1:31:15] really brother brandham comes back and
[1:31:19] he's probably telling the poorest people
[1:31:22] in his church that's right right he's
[1:31:25] sitting with the poorest people in the
[1:31:28] church and he's sitting there talking to
[1:31:30] hady
[1:31:32] Wright and hady wght said that's nothing
[1:31:36] but the truth brother
[1:31:39] brandom listen Eternal things happen in
[1:31:43] just a moment and brother brandham said
[1:31:46] the angel told him
[1:31:48] whatever she would want speak
[1:31:54] come on now you talking about incredible
[1:31:56] position she could have been the richest
[1:31:59] person in the
[1:32:02] world Listen God's
[1:32:05] God but she asked for something greater
[1:32:08] than money houses
[1:32:14] jobs my two sons and Billy Andrew stood
[1:32:18] in this pull pit and said if there's
[1:32:20] only two going to be there her two sons
[1:32:23] are going to
[1:32:30] there I want you to think just for a
[1:32:34] moment you remember when God spoke to me
[1:32:37] and
[1:32:40] said this will be special to you sister
[1:32:42] Denise because I've never told this
[1:32:47] part look past what you
[1:32:52] see and think past what you
[1:33:02] think brother Thomas you was with me in
[1:33:04] that Vision you were standing right
[1:33:09] here standing beside of me brother
[1:33:12] Thomas has been in two different Visions
[1:33:15] in my life that's a quite special
[1:33:20] spot and we was watching brother
[1:33:24] heril cross a
[1:33:29] bridge we'll be there one day we'll see
[1:33:33] him one
[1:33:40] day I want you to think past your
[1:33:43] Humanity just for a moment don't don't
[1:33:46] let the stuff in your life brother Ron
[1:33:48] I'm all tore up about this stuff this
[1:33:50] thing this deal with this a this is
[1:33:53] special
[1:33:55] sermon God don't look at the stuff in
[1:33:58] your
[1:34:02] life but those stuff will cause
[1:34:04] complexes and attitudes and all
[1:34:06] different kind of thing get past
[1:34:10] that look what the word is saying about
[1:34:13] you well brother Ron I see myself in a
[1:34:16] different element let me just say God
[1:34:18] don't look at you like you look at
[1:34:21] you God had to get Abraham to the spot
[1:34:24] that he didn't look at himself the way
[1:34:26] that he was it took years for Abraham to
[1:34:30] look at how God looked at
[1:34:35] Abraham listen brother I I just want to
[1:34:38] share this you and I just want to
[1:34:39] paraphrase whatever you are here is a
[1:34:43] reflection of what you'll be
[1:34:46] there whatever you are here is a
[1:34:49] reflection of what you'll be there there
[1:34:52] will be no Liars there no cheaters
[1:34:55] there you're talking about heaven
[1:34:58] there's going to be no sin
[1:35:01] there and there's going to be no
[1:35:03] sickness there the cancer demon will not
[1:35:07] be
[1:35:11] there your genuine object is there so
[1:35:17] you are a reflection of the genuine
[1:35:25] now listen this is direct quote now if
[1:35:28] you can trust the human part why not
[1:35:32] trust the
[1:35:35] Superhuman part if you can trust the
[1:35:38] body why not trust the
[1:35:43] spirit for the spirit is
[1:35:46] superior to the
[1:35:50] body listen I want you to just notice
[1:35:53] this this is powerful Shalom God doesn't
[1:35:56] make anything that
[1:36:01] perishes God doesn't make anything that
[1:36:08] perishes God is eternal and therefore
[1:36:12] this life that we now live is only refle
[1:36:16] reflecting what is ahead of
[1:36:21] us the real one cannot
[1:36:27] die is this microphone
[1:36:33] working the real one cannot die the
[1:36:37] body that cannot perish the life that
[1:36:41] cannot be taken and therefore the
[1:36:44] scriptures is right when it says that we
[1:36:48] have everlasting life we have eternal
[1:36:51] life
[1:36:57] we shall never
[1:37:03] die can I say it to you Homer Frasier
[1:37:06] did not
[1:37:08] die your loved ones did not
[1:37:12] die they were transported
[1:37:16] ubered Chariot to another
[1:37:20] dimension brother Donnie Reagan that was
[1:37:22] talking about his daughter
[1:37:24] that perished with cancer probably had
[1:37:26] more prayers than any other human being
[1:37:28] that ever but she did not
[1:37:32] die she did not
[1:37:39] die and if I perish off of this realm of
[1:37:42] this Earth I didn't
[1:37:47] die don't weep for me when I'm gone I'll
[1:37:50] be more alive there than I am
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:38:06] here as Christians you shouldn't fear
[1:38:10] death don't fear
[1:38:12] death don't fear
[1:38:15] it well brother Ron we hear songs about
[1:38:18] death we change those songs to songs
[1:38:21] about life
[1:38:26] Hallelujah this is about
[1:38:28] life life brother John steeman they were
[1:38:32] singing some sad songs in his in his
[1:38:35] room before he was diving dying he said
[1:38:38] hold
[1:38:39] on who's dying
[1:38:42] here who's dying here I'm going to my
[1:38:46] life
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:53] now God is
[1:38:55] infinite we all know that that he cannot
[1:39:00] change therefore where our faith can
[1:39:02] rest us so assured if God says anything
[1:39:06] it has to be that way
[1:39:09] forever it can never be changed God is
[1:39:13] omnipotent God is omnipresent and being
[1:39:16] om omnicient and makes him
[1:39:18] non-depressive he knows all things and
[1:39:21] God could not just be like the air
[1:39:24] because God has a Dwelling Place God is
[1:39:28] not a
[1:39:29] myth God is a being God Jesus he
[1:39:36] god listen with God you don't have to be
[1:39:38] pronouned
[1:39:42] correct he's not a layout of seeing God
[1:39:45] he's always been
[1:39:47] God he will forever be God he will
[1:39:51] eternally be God
[1:39:59] and he's a male god let's just get it
[1:40:03] straight he's a he
[1:40:05] God we're the Sheep part of
[1:40:09] God did you catch it turn your heing it
[1:40:13] up we're the Sheep part of
[1:40:15] God we came out of
[1:40:19] him
[1:40:21] Hallelujah therefore
[1:40:23] we are as Eternal as he is
[1:40:30] eternal
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:42] Hallelujah and God being
[1:40:45] infinite he knew all
[1:40:47] things before the world was ever
[1:40:50] created he knowed every fly
[1:40:54] every
[1:40:55] KN was ever
[1:40:58] created every time that he ever batted
[1:41:01] his
[1:41:06] eye how much tower that he
[1:41:10] had before the world ever started now
[1:41:14] that's
[1:41:15] infinite he knowed the
[1:41:19] end from the beginning
[1:41:25] that makes him
[1:41:27] infinite brother Ron I'd like to listen
[1:41:30] you do not have any fathom of what
[1:41:33] infinite really
[1:41:37] means that's a good Amen Brother
[1:41:41] Bill and it's
[1:41:45] true I want you to think about this is a
[1:41:47] powerful quote and this is where we're
[1:41:49] coming to a wind
[1:41:51] down now you're your old book is
[1:41:56] gone every one of you had an old
[1:42:00] book and there's chapters in there
[1:42:03] you'll never tell your children
[1:42:07] about that's a good one brother D listen
[1:42:12] there's things that we don't want nobody
[1:42:14] to know God knew
[1:42:21] it now your name in your old
[1:42:25] book has been
[1:42:30] transferred do you mean to tell me that
[1:42:33] that old my old book God put it in the
[1:42:36] sea of
[1:42:40] forgetfulness and you stand perfectly
[1:42:44] before
[1:42:47] god wow your amen should have been
[1:42:49] better than that I'm going to read it
[1:42:52] again and it's your
[1:42:54] turn God put it in the sea of
[1:42:58] forgetfulness and you stand
[1:43:04] perfectly before
[1:43:14] God now listen we got a glimpse of how
[1:43:18] God thought
[1:43:23] when brother random would stand there
[1:43:25] and tell people that things 40 years
[1:43:28] ago 50 years
[1:43:32] ago a
[1:43:34] glimpse but greater than even that God
[1:43:38] knows the end from the
[1:43:41] beginning are you with me and listen the
[1:43:45] Sea of God's forgetfulness brother
[1:43:48] Doug listen the devil may bring it up to
[1:43:51] you over and over again
[1:43:56] he may bring it up because he's got a
[1:43:57] book of
[1:43:59] memory but when God takes your memory
[1:44:01] brother
[1:44:02] Jim and you and I have talked about your
[1:44:05] your your Navy and all of that but the
[1:44:08] things that you and I talked about God
[1:44:10] don't even know
[1:44:14] about I want you to think about you and
[1:44:16] I as human beings we can Fellowship in a
[1:44:19] realm to where you remember those things
[1:44:21] and you bring it up because you talk
[1:44:23] about Grace but the god of
[1:44:27] Heaven don't even know about what you
[1:44:29] was
[1:44:37] like it's over it's
[1:44:46] done I want you to think about that
[1:44:49] David was a
[1:44:51] murderer right
[1:44:53] blood took care of
[1:44:55] it listen Rahab Tamar all of those and
[1:44:59] the blood took care of
[1:45:01] that how powerful is that
[1:45:09] blood how powerful is that blood and God
[1:45:12] puts it in a sea of God's
[1:45:14] forgetfulness and we've quoted it so
[1:45:16] many times and he put a sign there no
[1:45:20] fishing
[1:45:24] [Applause]
[1:45:29] now your name is now in the book of a
[1:45:31] new book not the book of life but the
[1:45:35] Lamb's Book of
[1:45:38] Life what the lamb what the lamb
[1:45:42] redeemed now the old book of your nature

[1:46:13] therefore being justified by faith Look
[1:46:16] up the word the word don't mean forgiven
[1:46:19] the word means Justified it don't mean

[1:56:30] awake you can be seated just one more
[1:56:32] moment we're getting ready to have a
[1:56:33] prayer line now I'm thinking I'm going
[1:56:35] this
[1:56:41] way what's getting ready to happen here
[1:56:44] brother
[1:56:45] Ron I just know this if God laid it on
[1:56:47] my heart a month ago to have this
[1:56:56] Amen brother Andrew told
[1:56:58] me said Dad wait on wait on the meeting
[1:57:03] one of the brothers might have an a
[1:57:05] burden to have a prayer line so I just
[1:57:08] held
[1:57:09] it and after the meeting they prayed for
[1:57:12] you as an open
[1:57:14] congregation and I told Andrew we have a
[1:57:18] job and I know some of you may have to
[1:57:20] get home or whatever you got to do we
[1:57:22] understand
[1:57:24] that but I believe there's people here
[1:57:26] that
[1:57:27] desires a real miracle in their
[1:57:30] life a real forgiveness in their life
[1:57:33] maybe there's complexes that you fought
[1:57:35] won't you just let it go won't you just
[1:57:38] let it go let it go tonight give it to
[1:57:40] Jesus

[1:57:47] to see a miracle well they told me I'd
[1:57:49] never walk
[1:57:50] again and 1994 I fell 40 ft I was
[1:57:55] paralyzed from just be below my ribs cuz
[1:57:59] I fell 40 feet and landed on concrete
[1:58:01] and they told me I'd never walk again
[1:58:03] and the statement I made to the doctor
[1:58:05] that night you don't know who you're
[1:58:07] talking
[1:58:09] to listen it took a year for me to get
[1:58:12] over it but I'm walking quite

[2:17:08] something great just come get in this
[2:17:10] line great things will be done here
[2:17:12] today and we are going to accept him for
[2:17:15] what he has done in our lives just a few
[2:17:18] just just a few weeks ago just two weeks
[2:17:21] ago sister Katie had been going just to
[2:17:23] just to build your faith just for a
[2:17:25] moment she had been going through the
[2:17:26] church age book and brother Brandon was
[2:17:28] talking about the omnipotence of God
[2:17:31] about his word being an action in our
[2:17:33] lives and she got up that morning and
[2:17:35] said Lord somehow today let me see your
[2:17:38] power in action we had a wonderful day
[2:17:41] we come back home we have a beautiful
[2:17:43] little dog and as we was coming back in
[2:17:46] just pulling right in somehow the dog
[2:17:49] got underneath of my wheel and I run
[2:17:51] right over top of the dog and it crushed
[2:17:54] us just to be honest it crushed us in a
[2:17:56] matter of moments but sister Katie went
[2:17:57] to action she went into action right
[2:18:00] there because she had been LED of the
[2:18:02] Lord that morning to pray Lord let me
[2:18:04] see your power in action somehow today
[2:18:06] that little dog was yelping it looked
[2:18:09] like his foot was completely broke
[2:18:11] sister Katie went into prayer and
[2:18:14] immediately as she got done praying she
[2:18:17] started thanking the Lord that little
[2:18:18] dog that was yelping and was in so much
[2:18:20] pain as soon as she said amen that dog
[2:18:22] put its foot down and took off running
[2:18:24] all over the place so if God
[2:18:28] cares if God cares for a little bitty
[2:18:31] dog how much more can he perform his
[2:18:34] word in action through this bride's body
