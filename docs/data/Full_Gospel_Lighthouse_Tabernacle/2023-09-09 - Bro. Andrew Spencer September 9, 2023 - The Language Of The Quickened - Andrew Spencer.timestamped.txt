[47:15] for me

[47:31] just because
[47:37] he's
[47:38] gone Hallelujah
[47:42] I think we got something to thank the
[47:44] Lord about
[47:45] I believe we can remember back the past
[47:47] week and remember all that he's done for
[47:49] us
[47:50] isn't it wonderful to say that we've
[47:52] been able to be in the presence of The
[47:54] Great I Am
[47:56] to think just back just a few days ago
[47:59] where we were setting in these moments
[48:01] but to think that tonight he's still God
[48:04] he's still God he's still a Waymaker
[48:07] he's still a promise keeper he's gone
[48:10] [Applause]
[48:13] he's done for me
[48:20] redeem
[48:22] and said set me free
[48:32] just because
[48:35] [Music]
[48:36] he's gone

[48:43] the Lord a hand clap of Praise And I
[48:46] Hallelujah
[48:49] Hallelujah
[48:52] all right
[48:55] we've got so much to be thankful for
[48:58] man if you have your Bibles this evening
[49:00] when lock to look over in a couple
[49:02] portions of scripture Ephesians chapter
[49:05] 2 and
[49:06] then also John chapter 16 and 12 and I
[49:10] just wanna
[49:12] again thank the Lord for all that he did
[49:14] for us this past weekend and our Labor
[49:17] Day meetings and one of the most
[49:19] successful meetings we've ever been a
[49:21] part of and uh to thank
[49:24] it's our Jubilee time and you know we've
[49:27] we're just really privileged to have our
[49:30] our brother Timothy and brother Tim and
[49:31] brother Donnie come and speak such
[49:33] masterpieces and we think so highly of
[49:36] their Ministries and and we just know
[49:38] that the Lord used them in a mighty way
[49:40] and
[49:42] um many wonderful things have abounded
[49:44] from those meetings and I know that
[49:46] there'll be a blessing for until we
[49:48] leave here
[49:49] amen amen before we read tonight maybe
[49:52] we'll just speak to the author of the
[49:54] word here Heavenly Father we come before
[49:57] you tonight Lord we're your children
[49:59] Lord and we recognize whose presence
[50:02] that we're in Lord is this presence that
[50:06] we feel here tonight it's it's not that
[50:08] of a pope it's not that of a potentate
[50:11] or a king it's the presence
[50:13] a little Sharia the presence of The
[50:15] Great I Am and to think father how that
[50:18] you have brought us out of the worlds of
[50:21] chaos and to think that you're the god
[50:24] that is fighting for us when we think
[50:26] about every song that's been sung here
[50:28] this this evening Lord every special was
[50:30] lined up father you're fighting for your
[50:33] children
[50:33] every sick and Afflicted and diseased
[50:36] one you're fighting for them because
[50:38] that's just your way you're the same
[50:40] yesterday today and forever and tonight
[50:43] we invite you Lord Jesus Lord to come
[50:46] and lay your hands upon every one of us
[50:48] here under the sound of your voice
[50:50] father begin to minister to us Lord
[50:53] according to your word Lord your people
[50:55] with hungered we have fed we have
[50:57] rejoiced over the things that were done
[50:59] in our meetings this past week and I
[51:02] pray father that you would once again
[51:04] come Lord Just Like You Do Lord and
[51:06] begin to minister to your people father
[51:09] I pray that you'd bind every evil spirit
[51:11] in every demonic power that would hinder
[51:14] us father from moving into the presence
[51:16] of the Living God may we just lay aside
[51:18] every thought and everything of the
[51:20] world just now and come in fully under
[51:23] the anointing of the word father and
[51:26] find our position in you in the name of
[51:28] the Lord Jesus Christ we ask these
[51:30] things amen
[51:33] Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1 and you
[51:37] hath he quickened who were dead in
[51:40] trespasses and sins
[51:42] wherein times past you walked according
[51:45] to the course of this world according to
[51:49] the prince of the power of the air the
[51:52] spirit that now worketh in the children
[51:54] of Disobedience among whom also we all
[51:58] had our conversations in times past in
[52:02] the lust of our flesh fulfilling the
[52:04] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[52:07] Word By Nature children of Wrath even as
[52:11] others and I'm so thankful that that was
[52:13] in the past
[52:15] but God who is rich in Mercy
[52:18] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[52:21] even when we were dead in sins hath
[52:24] quickened us together which Christ with
[52:28] Christ by Grace you are saved John
[52:31] chapter 16 and verse 12.
[52:40] John chapter 16 and verse 12.
[52:43] and here our Lord speaks some very
[52:45] powerful powerful words that we've we've
[52:48] garnered things many times our Prophet
[52:52] would speak from this from this this
[52:54] portion of scripture he would speak the
[52:55] spirit of Truth he would speak the God
[52:58] and he would speak different things
[53:00] across across these texts right here and
[53:03] Jesus said in verse 12 he said I have
[53:05] yet many things to say unto you but you
[53:08] cannot bear them and to think that the
[53:11] disciples where they were they they had
[53:13] watched the Living God they'd watched
[53:15] Jesus in action but they could not
[53:17] handle because there was another
[53:19] Ministry that was coming that was coming
[53:21] into play and it was it was your
[53:23] ministry it's the ministry of Christ in
[53:25] your life and to think they could not
[53:28] bear those things because it wasn't
[53:29] their time but how be it when he the
[53:32] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[53:35] you into all Truth for he shall not
[53:38] speak of himself but of whatsoever he
[53:41] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[53:44] will show you things to come and he
[53:47] shall glorify me for he shall receive of
[53:50] mine and show it shall show it unto you
[53:53] all things that the father hath are mine
[53:56] therefore said I that he shall take of
[53:59] mine and show it unto you may God bless
[54:03] his word he may be seated in the
[54:05] presence of the Lord tonight I'd like to
[54:08] speak to you a thought that the Lord's
[54:09] been been dealing with us on for for
[54:12] some time now just kind of in our spirit
[54:14] here but I'd like to speak to you on a
[54:16] thought on the language of the quickened
[54:19] the language of the quick and we
[54:21] recognize immediately that the spirit of
[54:24] Truth is the one that is going to guide
[54:26] us into all truth and we recognize by by
[54:29] Jesus's words that that the spirit of
[54:31] Truth is going to speak what the spirit
[54:34] is saying he is not going to add to he's
[54:37] not going to add or take away but it is
[54:39] simply going to speak what the father is
[54:42] speaking and we recognize that where we
[54:43] are are living at as the Church of the
[54:45] Living God that our lord Jesus the
[54:47] spirit of the word the author of the
[54:49] word is the same one that was speaking
[54:51] all the way back there in the Garden of
[54:54] Eden and we recognize that that same
[54:56] spirit is speaking right here in the
[54:59] very last age amongst the Church of the
[55:01] Living God and to think that that the
[55:03] the Bible is very clear and very evident
[55:05] upon this that that he that is the
[55:08] spirit of truth will speak in this last
[55:10] days and and Peter or Paul would say
[55:13] that in his letter to Timothy in first
[55:15] Timothy 4 and 1 that now the spirit
[55:17] speaketh expressing that in latter times
[55:20] some shall depart from the faith and we
[55:23] recognize that that does not Shake us
[55:25] because we recognize that we are under a
[55:28] under a Commandment that the spirit had
[55:31] already prophesied when you see loved
[55:33] ones and you see ones that are departing
[55:35] not from a faith but they're departing
[55:37] from the faith that which we are
[55:40] contending for we recognize that the
[55:42] spirit has already spoke to us that
[55:45] these things should come to pass but we
[55:47] know this that the spirit is the one
[55:49] that doeth the speaking and we recognize
[55:52] that without him any mortal man is
[55:54] completely helpless without the spirit
[55:56] of the Living God we recognize that the
[55:59] scriptures that we are reading that all
[56:01] of them came by the very inspiration of
[56:04] the Holy Ghost and we we look throughout
[56:06] the The Book of Revelations and we'll
[56:08] find that every Church age that at the
[56:11] end of that church age you'll see that
[56:13] Jesus announces to that church age that
[56:16] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[56:18] the spirit is saying unto the churches
[56:21] but you we recognize and understand this
[56:23] that only a Spirit-filled man can hear
[56:26] the Revelation for that age so we
[56:29] understand immediately that there are
[56:30] going to be people that may be sit
[56:33] around it or maybe people that get close
[56:34] to it but the people that only hear what
[56:37] the spirit is speaking they can only
[56:39] understand the revelation of what the
[56:42] messenger is releasing in that
[56:43] generation or in that age or in that
[56:46] moment so we recognize if we want to
[56:48] catch what the spirit is speaking to the
[56:50] age we've got to have the same Spirit of
[56:53] the one that spoke the word because if
[56:55] we are not in tune with the one that
[56:57] wrote the word we'll never be able to
[56:59] act upon the word of God but if we are
[57:01] in tune with the spirit of the one that
[57:04] wrote the word then we can express what
[57:06] God thought of before the foundation of
[57:08] the world so we realize that it is his
[57:11] Spirit throughout every Church age that
[57:13] it was a spirit that was speaking
[57:15] through Paul it was a spirit that was
[57:17] speaking through iranius and Columba and
[57:19] all the way down through through Wesley
[57:21] and Martin and William Bradham we
[57:23] recognize it was not the man it was the
[57:26] spirit of God that God was using that
[57:28] anointing or that man under that
[57:31] dispensation that he was sitting there a
[57:33] man that could tap into the very mind of
[57:35] Christ for the age that he was under you
[57:38] see because if William Branham would
[57:39] have came with with Paul's message or or
[57:42] with Luther's message it would have not
[57:44] match the peace that we were needing
[57:45] here in laodicea because we needed a
[57:49] releasing message we needed a
[57:50] restoration message we didn't need the
[57:52] man-age anointing upon us that it
[57:54] already came and it's still here but
[57:57] what we needed was an eagle anointing to
[57:59] take our faith to recognize that what
[58:01] the spirit was speaking for laodicea to
[58:04] take us higher into a realm to believe
[58:06] that all things are possible we had to
[58:08] come under a messenger and a people that
[58:11] are under that messenger that have got
[58:13] the spirit of the one that wrote the
[58:15] word they will be a final voice to the
[58:17] final h
[58:18] is that right so we realize that all of
[58:21] this is in line with First Corinthians
[58:23] chapter 2 and 11 for what man knoweth
[58:26] the things of a man
[58:28] save the spirit of man which is in him
[58:30] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[58:34] but the spirit of God now we have
[58:36] received not the spirit of the world but
[58:38] the spirit which is of god that we might
[58:41] know the things that are freely given
[58:43] unto us which things also we speak not
[58:46] in Words which man's Wisdom teaches but
[58:49] which the Holy Ghost teacheth so if
[58:51] we're going to understand the scriptures
[58:53] if we're going to understand the age
[58:54] that we're in we've got to be led by the
[58:57] spirit how did Simeon get down there to
[59:00] baby Jesus when it was his time to go
[59:03] into the temple he was led by the spirit
[59:05] how are men under the anointing of the
[59:08] word how are they going to find Thee the
[59:11] avenue to preach a message that is going
[59:13] to bring a people Deliverance except by
[59:16] the preaching of the word under the
[59:18] anointing of the spirit of living God
[59:21] now you remember when William Branham
[59:23] would tell us he said he said you would
[59:24] take he said you'd take a little fish he
[59:26] said that little fish has certain
[59:28] certain senses about its body and it has
[59:30] certain things he said it's got it by
[59:32] radar so that it looks for food in
[59:34] certain places all the way down there in
[59:36] that dark deep midnight ink it can't
[59:39] find anything it can't see anything but
[59:41] yet it's got a sense so that it can know
[59:43] and hunt for food because of radar he
[59:45] said but our sense of sight is so much
[59:48] better than that little fish is down
[59:50] there that can look down there and find
[59:52] it our sense of sight is so much greater
[59:54] than that little fish he said but hello
[59:57] if that fist could become me he said if
[1:00:00] that fish could become me he would never
[1:00:02] want to go back to living that kind of a
[1:00:04] fish life again he said but he's got to
[1:00:06] be pressurized to live in the atmosphere
[1:00:09] that we as human beings live at you see
[1:00:12] you and I understand what it's like to
[1:00:14] be caught up from what it would be as
[1:00:17] known as the nature of the old man so we
[1:00:19] know what it's like to live in the
[1:00:21] nature of the new man and there's no way
[1:00:24] that you and I there's not anybody
[1:00:26] that's here spirit filled by the holy
[1:00:28] ghost that could ever be talked in into
[1:00:30] of going back to that kind of a living
[1:00:32] anymore but oh if you understand who you
[1:00:36] are if you understand where you are
[1:00:38] you've been pressurized you're not just
[1:00:41] a little fishy tonight you're the Church
[1:00:43] of the Living God there's no way that no
[1:00:45] devil in hell could talk you back into
[1:00:47] going out there and living that kind of
[1:00:49] a life anymore because that's not who
[1:00:52] you are anymore you don't even know that
[1:00:54] language no more you don't even know the
[1:00:56] talk no more but what you do know is
[1:00:59] that there is a land beyond the river
[1:01:01] what you do know that there is a holy
[1:01:03] ghost what you do know there is a
[1:01:05] message
[1:01:07] what is it we've never been caught up
[1:01:08] into the realm of faith and we're not
[1:01:10] going back to that kind of a life no
[1:01:12] more
[1:01:13] you see what it was when the Prodigal
[1:01:15] Son recognized and remember who he was
[1:01:18] he remembered he could go back to his
[1:01:20] daddy's house and he could live like a
[1:01:22] son again and when you got that kind of
[1:01:24] faith and you know who you are you're
[1:01:26] not going back to hog living no more now
[1:01:29] I'm going to take you higher than that
[1:01:30] why would you go back to denominational
[1:01:32] thinking when you've already been
[1:01:34] birthed into a message that gives you
[1:01:36] the very mind of Christ to tap into the
[1:01:39] channels of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:41] well Glory Luther never walked where
[1:01:44] you're walking Wesley never walked where
[1:01:46] you're walking why would you want to go
[1:01:47] back to that kind of a living
[1:01:50] come on somebody you're not talking
[1:01:52] Luther's language you're not talking
[1:01:54] Wesley's language you're talking this
[1:01:57] Malachi 4 language and it's this
[1:02:00] language that'll change your mortal
[1:02:02] bodies
[1:02:05] what was it when they got out there out
[1:02:08] through the upper room they wasn't
[1:02:09] talking their language no more they were
[1:02:11] talking a Heavenly language
[1:02:13] foreign
[1:02:15] said here in perfect Faith he said we
[1:02:18] are taught to resist the devil and he
[1:02:21] will flee from us he said now to resist
[1:02:23] it's just to Simply turn him down just
[1:02:27] resist him and just to walk away from it
[1:02:30] so when Satan comes to you with offers
[1:02:33] of of just easy believism what do you
[1:02:36] got to do you've got to turn him down if
[1:02:38] he offers you a better kind of Life turn
[1:02:41] him down if he offers you success in the
[1:02:43] world what do you do you turn him down
[1:02:46] come on somebody if he offers you money
[1:02:49] what do you do you turn him down if he
[1:02:51] offers you so that you can have a
[1:02:53] kingdom without a Calvary what do you do
[1:02:55] you turn him down
[1:02:57] he said you just resist him he said
[1:02:58] that's the way it is you walk away from
[1:03:01] him he said God said a certain thing no
[1:03:03] matter what he's trying to tell you you
[1:03:05] don't have to listen to the devil your
[1:03:07] ears are death to anything else but what
[1:03:10] the spirit says
[1:03:12] your ears are deaf to anything else but
[1:03:15] what the spirit says to he that hath an
[1:03:18] ear listen see what the spirit saith
[1:03:20] under the churches he said that's one
[1:03:23] thing that the one thing that's got a
[1:03:25] listening post that catches what the
[1:03:28] spirit says unto the churches so you see
[1:03:31] your ear is death to everything else out
[1:03:35] there in the world you can't even think
[1:03:37] that kind of thinking you can't even
[1:03:39] hear that kind of a hearing no more
[1:03:41] you see you see you look at these TVs
[1:03:44] and you look at these instruments of
[1:03:45] radio and you look at them you say oh I
[1:03:47] wish I had that kind of ability then I
[1:03:50] could produce a picture like that but do
[1:03:52] you realize that you are built so much
[1:03:54] greater than that television that Taps
[1:03:56] into a channel that breaks into an
[1:03:58] atmosphere and brings what's here in the
[1:04:00] waves of the sound and in the airwaves
[1:04:03] and brings it to pass but you are built
[1:04:05] in a greater way than that you are built
[1:04:08] so that you hear that hearing our faith
[1:04:11] comes by hearing do you recognize that
[1:04:13] you are the channel which God is looking
[1:04:16] for to bring forth miracles
[1:04:19] God ain't looking for TVs to bring forth
[1:04:21] Miracles God ain't looking for tape
[1:04:23] players to bring forth Miracles God is
[1:04:25] looking for human beings that have
[1:04:27] understood by the preaching of the word
[1:04:29] that faith has risen Hallelujah you're
[1:04:32] barely you're built greater you are
[1:04:34] built under the channel of the Holy
[1:04:36] Ghost
[1:04:37] I've been dropping this to you that over
[1:04:40] and over again before you can believe it
[1:04:43] somebody's got to preach it that's what
[1:04:45] Paul said in Romans 10 and 17 Faith
[1:04:47] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:04:50] of God so if you're going to believe in
[1:04:52] a miracle somebody's got to preach about
[1:04:54] a miracle if you're going to believe in
[1:04:56] a Rapture you've got to have somebody
[1:04:58] preach to you that there is a Rapture if
[1:05:01] you're going to believe anything you've
[1:05:03] got to hear about it
[1:05:05] well hey we had a voice speak to us in
[1:05:08] this day that in the last days that I
[1:05:11] will sin unto you Malachi 4. ain't it
[1:05:14] wonderful to recognize Who You Are
[1:05:18] what are you looking at brother Andrew
[1:05:20] I'm looking at a people that know who
[1:05:22] they are
[1:05:23] how did Elijah how did Elijah tell
[1:05:26] gajesha when the when them Angels were
[1:05:28] out there William Branham said that it
[1:05:30] had been Elijah didn't even see them
[1:05:31] angels He said but he understood by the
[1:05:34] scripture of Psalms 34 and 7 that them
[1:05:37] Angels were encamped about them that
[1:05:39] fear him so Elijah didn't necessarily
[1:05:41] see it and you may not see your miracle
[1:05:43] in the room you may not see your healing
[1:05:45] in the room but by faith
[1:05:48] Elijah could say look out there geesha
[1:05:51] there's more with us than there is
[1:05:53] against us and I don't know whether you
[1:05:55] understand this or not there's more
[1:05:57] miracles coming there's more prodigals
[1:05:59] returning there's more faith arising
[1:06:01] than what you can see in the building
[1:06:05] how do you know it brother answer he's
[1:06:07] the same yesterday today and forever God
[1:06:10] ain't changed one time God ain't lost
[1:06:13] one power his power's not been damaged
[1:06:15] his powers not been demolished
[1:06:19] how do you say those things brother
[1:06:21] Andrew I've got the authority of God's
[1:06:23] word to back up what are you saying
[1:06:26] brother ain't true this is the language
[1:06:28] of a third pole people
[1:06:32] what is it what is the third pull it's
[1:06:35] our language to the king it's a king's
[1:06:39] heart
[1:06:40] this King has handled this sword before
[1:06:42] and this queen knows exactly what he
[1:06:45] wants done with the word
[1:06:48] what is it it's a very mind of God
[1:06:52] when William Branham preaches future
[1:06:54] home and things that are to be what is
[1:06:57] it it's God's Vision being projected by
[1:07:00] a prophet that this is God's Own
[1:07:02] thoughts this is what I'm looking for
[1:07:04] this is the kind of character that I
[1:07:07] have these are the kind of people that
[1:07:08] are going to live in my city people that
[1:07:10] understand who I am
[1:07:14] you know him
[1:07:16] you know him and because you know him
[1:07:18] there's power in Resurrection you see
[1:07:21] how is God going to allow anybody to
[1:07:24] live in his house that doesn't
[1:07:25] understand him that doesn't know him and
[1:07:29] because you know him you understand him
[1:07:31] you see I could say something to you and
[1:07:35] it wouldn't mean nothing to a Baptist or
[1:07:37] it wouldn't mean nothing to a church of
[1:07:39] Christ but I could say the same thing to
[1:07:41] you and it'll make you shout it'll make
[1:07:44] you dance it'll make you scream and
[1:07:45] it'll make you holler why because you
[1:07:47] understand him that's why the rest of
[1:07:50] the world is saying why are they so
[1:07:51] happy why are they leaping why are they
[1:07:54] shouting it's because you are in tune
[1:07:56] with the spirit that is speaking in this
[1:07:58] generation
[1:08:01] it's a powerful thing when you
[1:08:03] understand when you understand him you
[1:08:07] see what did what did Elijah do to
[1:08:09] gehaza he simply changed his vision to
[1:08:12] not look at what he was seeing but look
[1:08:15] to the Unseen what did what did Moses
[1:08:18] when he was standing there and the
[1:08:20] opposition was against him when they've
[1:08:22] got the Red Sea when they've got the Red
[1:08:24] Sea in front of them they've got the
[1:08:26] pillar of fire behind them and they've
[1:08:28] got iseros Egyptians armies out there
[1:08:31] and they're chasing him down but what
[1:08:33] does the spirit of God say why cry speak
[1:08:36] and go forward you see you don't have to
[1:08:39] worry about what's in front of you as
[1:08:41] long as you know who's behind you
[1:08:44] come on now you don't have to worry
[1:08:46] about Egypt you don't have to worry
[1:08:48] about Pharaoh it's a pillar of Fire
[1:08:52] if he's behind you if he's got your six
[1:08:55] I'll tell you one thing for sure ain't
[1:08:57] no damn on Hell gonna rob you from your
[1:09:00] joy ain't gonna rob you from your
[1:09:02] inheritance he's not going to rob you
[1:09:04] from your Abstract title dude
[1:09:05] [Applause]
[1:09:09] these men were commissioned but they
[1:09:11] were afraid
[1:09:14] most of them been up on that mountain
[1:09:16] he's commissioned but he was
[1:09:18] disappointing God because he was afraid
[1:09:21] he said what are you looking at
[1:09:24] it's amazing how our language changes
[1:09:29] by what we see
[1:09:32] it's amazing it's amazing how a doctor
[1:09:36] can look at a scene because of a CT
[1:09:39] scanner or an MRI and it can say a
[1:09:42] certain word and your whole entire day
[1:09:44] changes
[1:09:47] because of what somebody else is seeing
[1:09:50] before you walked in there and seen what
[1:09:53] them doctors had you was out there
[1:09:55] profession I am healed by his stripes
[1:09:57] but the power of faith it doesn't matter
[1:10:00] what you're looking at it doesn't matter
[1:10:02] what you're seeing you are simply
[1:10:04] staying with the word of God and it
[1:10:07] didn't matter how big it didn't matter
[1:10:09] how big that that Red Sea was and it
[1:10:12] didn't matter how big Pharaoh's Army was
[1:10:14] behind them there was a God that was on
[1:10:17] their side
[1:10:19] now for two million people to get across
[1:10:21] a Red Sea God's got to open that Red Sea
[1:10:24] five miles
[1:10:25] five miles wide to get two million
[1:10:28] people across there in the right timing
[1:10:30] and if God can take a pillar of fire and
[1:10:33] move back the greatest one of the
[1:10:35] greatest rivers that there is move back
[1:10:37] that Sea move it back move that sea back
[1:10:40] if you can move it back five miles for
[1:10:42] two million people what can he do with
[1:10:44] you
[1:10:47] don't let what you see change your faith
[1:10:51] now brother random said he said in the
[1:10:53] Book of Job he said job feared and what
[1:10:55] he feared it actually happened he said
[1:10:58] what brought it his fear
[1:11:00] he said that's what made it happen he
[1:11:02] said his faith had kept him from it but
[1:11:05] his fear brought him brought it to him
[1:11:07] he was scared and it was he was scared
[1:11:10] it was going to happen and it did happen
[1:11:12] now he said he noted what happened now
[1:11:15] he he knowed it wouldn't happen he
[1:11:17] wouldn't it wouldn't have happened you
[1:11:19] see here you see he what it what brought
[1:11:21] that to him was his fear his faith kept
[1:11:25] it away but his fear brought it to him
[1:11:27] you see oftentimes our language
[1:11:30] completely changes
[1:11:32] the Bible said that job was a perfect
[1:11:34] man but what he was looking at what he
[1:11:37] was looking at was almost greater than
[1:11:40] what he thought his life was worth
[1:11:43] the obstacles that was taking place in
[1:11:46] job's life 42 chapters the obstacles
[1:11:49] that was against job all of that you can
[1:11:52] look through all of them scriptures and
[1:11:53] all of that happened in one year
[1:12:01] one year all that happened to job he
[1:12:03] lost everything
[1:12:05] but job was sitting out there and he
[1:12:07] began to look at his problems but God
[1:12:09] has not asked us to look at our problems
[1:12:12] he's looked he's looking for us to look
[1:12:15] at his promise
[1:12:17] when Peter was out there when Peter's
[1:12:19] out there on that waves those white caps
[1:12:22] were rolling across there and they were
[1:12:24] scared that they were going to they were
[1:12:26] scared that they were going to die out
[1:12:27] there in the middle of that storm
[1:12:30] all of a sudden
[1:12:32] Here Comes Jesus walking on the waters
[1:12:35] Here Comes Jesus walking on the waters
[1:12:39] notice what it does he was fearful
[1:12:42] and then he had faith
[1:12:45] why because the one that was walking on
[1:12:47] the waters
[1:12:49] I began to look at that picture that you
[1:12:50] bought a sister Anna brother Jeffrey I
[1:12:53] began to look at that today and I began
[1:12:55] to think about how great those waves
[1:12:57] were Peter been out there on them Waters
[1:12:59] many times but he ain't never seen a
[1:13:01] storm like this
[1:13:03] and when he looked out there and he saw
[1:13:05] Jesus walking on the waters what did he
[1:13:08] do he said Lord if that be you bid me to
[1:13:12] come what did Jesus do he changed his
[1:13:15] fear to Faith that's what Jesus is doing
[1:13:18] right here in the midst of the Church of
[1:13:20] the Living God he's changing your fear
[1:13:22] for Faith you don't have to worry about
[1:13:25] Daniel's heart trouble you don't have to
[1:13:27] worry about how the baby's coming you
[1:13:29] don't have to worry about how sugar
[1:13:31] diabetes is living leaving you don't
[1:13:33] have to worry about how cancer is
[1:13:34] leaving this word
[1:13:37] is changing your fear to Faith
[1:13:42] foreign
[1:13:44] Jesus and Peter walking on the water
[1:13:46] together it's a pretty awesome sight
[1:13:51] I'd like to see that it's the same as
[1:13:53] you taking God at his word and walking
[1:13:55] through laodicea whenever Devon hails
[1:13:58] got its head got its head and it's got
[1:14:00] its Target over you it's the same with
[1:14:02] your faith to believe for the impossible
[1:14:04] to step out on the waters unafraid
[1:14:07] but notice what happened with Peter
[1:14:10] Peter started looking at the wind
[1:14:13] are you you no good and well you can't
[1:14:15] see wind
[1:14:18] you can't see the wind but you can see
[1:14:20] the effects of the Wind
[1:14:22] what did he do he started looking at the
[1:14:25] circumstances around him because of the
[1:14:28] wind of the prince of the power of the
[1:14:30] air and it changed what what Peter was
[1:14:33] looking at he was looking at the word
[1:14:35] why did Peter step out there in the
[1:14:37] first place because the word said he
[1:14:39] could step out there
[1:14:41] and what did he do fear came and it made
[1:14:44] him lose his faith in what the word says
[1:14:47] what did the word say the enemy the
[1:14:50] enemy came against Peter just like that
[1:14:52] in a matter of seconds and changed his
[1:14:55] vision to change his language
[1:14:59] to see what Satan will do to you he'll
[1:15:01] throw sickness in your way he'll throw
[1:15:03] troubles in your way he'll throw
[1:15:05] roadblocks in your way to mess up your
[1:15:07] mind to change your vision because if he
[1:15:11] can change your vision he can change
[1:15:12] your language
[1:15:15] is that right if you can change your
[1:15:17] language if you can change your vision
[1:15:19] it can change your language because
[1:15:20] there's power in your tongue there's
[1:15:22] power in your speech he's the high
[1:15:24] priest of our confession
[1:15:27] what was he doing he was doing all right
[1:15:28] till he got scared he started walking on
[1:15:31] water and what Peter feared happened
[1:15:36] well Peter feared happened
[1:15:39] I believe that more people have more
[1:15:41] faith in their fear
[1:15:45] they've got more faith in their fear
[1:15:47] than the Devils got fear in their faith
[1:15:52] you see what what what Peter feared
[1:15:54] actually happened it's amazing uh
[1:15:58] I know every child every child is
[1:16:01] understanding this mama stick a pile of
[1:16:03] towels over towels and clothes that you
[1:16:06] need to fold up the next day
[1:16:08] stick them over in the corner I can't
[1:16:10] tell you how many times I've seen ghosts
[1:16:11] hanging over in the corner
[1:16:15] that's why I was a good boy I always put
[1:16:16] my clothes away first before I went to
[1:16:18] bed
[1:16:18] I was tired of seeing them ghosts
[1:16:20] hanging over in that corner
[1:16:21] but it's amazing it's amazing what you
[1:16:24] do in the window of the night you wake
[1:16:25] up and all of a sudden you see them in
[1:16:27] pile of clothes sitting over everything
[1:16:28] man your imagination gets to playing
[1:16:30] what did it do you are perfectly in
[1:16:33] peace over there sleeping but because of
[1:16:35] what you've seen it changed your whole
[1:16:37] atmosphere
[1:16:39] see what are you looking at brother
[1:16:40] Andrew why is your faith so high I'm not
[1:16:43] worried about how you're going to get in
[1:16:45] I'm looking at the promise I'm not
[1:16:47] looking at how brother Ron's going to
[1:16:48] get healed I'm looking at Calvary I'm
[1:16:50] not looking at your prodigals out there
[1:16:52] still in the in the Sin and the muck to
[1:16:55] the world I'm looking at the promise
[1:16:58] what is that promise brother Danny it
[1:17:00] tells us that we're going to be there
[1:17:02] and our Offspring with him and if God is
[1:17:05] as good as his word I don't have to
[1:17:07] understand how he's going to do it I
[1:17:09] just have to take him Matt his word
[1:17:14] well somebody give the Lord a hand clap
[1:17:16] of Breeze
[1:17:20] when you believe you can walk on the
[1:17:22] water but when you fear you start
[1:17:24] sinking I say it's high time you let
[1:17:27] your faith rise grab a hold of the
[1:17:30] master of the wind and start walking on
[1:17:33] your troubles
[1:17:34] [Applause]
[1:17:35] well Glory
[1:17:39] Glory
[1:17:41] well the man said he said let loose and
[1:17:43] let go
[1:17:44] he said how do you do that brother
[1:17:45] Brandon he said just let go that's all
[1:17:49] you have to do take God's word don't try
[1:17:51] to work up nothing don't let down at the
[1:17:53] altar don't get down as the Altar and
[1:17:55] beat on it and holler God give me the
[1:17:57] Holy Ghost Lord give me the Holy Ghost
[1:17:59] he ain't coming you beating on the altar
[1:18:01] that ain't gonna do you no good no that
[1:18:04] ain't the that ain't the way it comes
[1:18:06] it's taking him at his word
[1:18:11] he said look at Peter Peter was in
[1:18:13] trouble looked like he was going to die
[1:18:15] and he's seen the Lord come walking on
[1:18:16] water he said Lord if it be you bid me
[1:18:19] come he said Lord said come on now Peter
[1:18:22] said now wait a minute Lord let me go on
[1:18:24] a 40-day fast to see if I can walk on
[1:18:27] water or not oh Lord let me get enough
[1:18:28] Spirit on me that I can dance in the
[1:18:30] spirit and speak in tongues in this boat
[1:18:32] then I can step out no sir he took God
[1:18:35] in his word he let loose and let go just
[1:18:39] took him through it he said what if God
[1:18:41] when he met Moses said Moses go down
[1:18:43] there and into Egypt and tell Pharaoh
[1:18:45] let my people go what if Moses said let
[1:18:48] me go on a 40-day fast see if I got
[1:18:50] enough Faith to obey you God give me
[1:18:53] something something another Lord let me
[1:18:55] tell you something let me let me see if
[1:18:56] I got enough spirit in me first Moses
[1:18:58] never asked no questions
[1:19:01] he just took God at his word and took
[1:19:04] off he said that's the way you have to
[1:19:06] do it take God at his word then you know
[1:19:09] you'll be able to do it he didn't wait
[1:19:11] till something else took him place he
[1:19:13] just went ahead and he done it
[1:19:15] what are you doing brother Angela I'm
[1:19:18] telling you that if you can take God at
[1:19:20] his word
[1:19:21] you can change your body
[1:19:24] what is it what is it it's the Dynamics
[1:19:27] that's come upon the mechanics and it's
[1:19:29] making it all come to pass what is the
[1:19:32] Dynamics it's a refilling of the Holy
[1:19:35] Ghost and what is he doing in this
[1:19:37] generation he's pouring the very mind of
[1:19:40] Christ into the vessels that have
[1:19:42] emptied themselves out so that he could
[1:19:45] pour himself in now William Branham said
[1:19:47] in the seventh seal he said if there's a
[1:19:49] pie he said if there's a pile of
[1:19:50] trumpets sitting up here he said he said
[1:19:53] they are completely mute without a human
[1:19:55] being to get behind them and blow
[1:19:57] through it he said they're completely
[1:19:59] mute he said and if God would come and
[1:20:01] work through me or work through one of
[1:20:04] these brothers he said it wouldn't be me
[1:20:06] he would be the intelligence behind the
[1:20:08] sound the trumpet is completely mute but
[1:20:12] it's the intelligence behind the sound
[1:20:14] that makes it sound out what is that
[1:20:18] that is speaking out of you that is
[1:20:20] saying that all things are possible it's
[1:20:22] the intelligence of the one that wrote
[1:20:24] the word when Moses was back there
[1:20:27] talking to a burning bush what was it it
[1:20:29] was the intelligence that had the power
[1:20:31] to get Egypt get Israel out of Egypt
[1:20:35] what was it Moses didn't have to figure
[1:20:37] out how to get out of it
[1:20:39] he'd have to figure out how big and how
[1:20:41] many Giants and how many people were
[1:20:43] down there he didn't have to figure it
[1:20:45] out the intelligence that was talking to
[1:20:47] him at that Burning Bush was everything
[1:20:50] that Moses had need of
[1:20:52] who glow the Lord of Mercy
[1:20:55] I believe I'm getting ready to talk in
[1:20:57] another language what was it it had the
[1:20:59] power to speak to Moses and Moses was
[1:21:04] once afraid running from the presence of
[1:21:06] the Lord
[1:21:09] but a burning bush something that
[1:21:12] scientifically cannot be proven it
[1:21:14] changed his language
[1:21:17] how to change his language brother
[1:21:19] Andrew he went from being a coward to me
[1:21:23] in a one-man Invasion with a rod in his
[1:21:25] hand
[1:21:26] what was it that Burning Bush was a sign
[1:21:29] that had a voice behind it and the voice
[1:21:32] that was backing up the sign was going
[1:21:35] to make sure that Israel got out and got
[1:21:38] to her Homeland
[1:21:40] it's the same intelligence that is
[1:21:43] working amongst the body of Jesus Christ
[1:21:44] and he's bringing her out now notice all
[1:21:48] of them Israelites are down there all
[1:21:50] them years
[1:21:51] but what was they doing
[1:21:54] they was waiting on God
[1:21:56] my brother random said God was waiting
[1:21:58] on them to put him into action
[1:22:00] he was waiting on them to put him in
[1:22:03] action now Moses was born with a purpose
[1:22:06] in his life but brother random said it
[1:22:08] was spoken word is the Original Seed he
[1:22:10] said he had to wait for the extra gift
[1:22:12] to get the job done and what you have
[1:22:15] made of is this message of Malachi 4.
[1:22:19] you see you had to wait you may have
[1:22:21] been born you may have been born before
[1:22:23] the seals were released but you had to
[1:22:25] wait on themselves to get into a rapture
[1:22:29] that's what brother Brandon said in
[1:22:30] perfect Faith he said when a man lives
[1:22:32] by faith walks by faith I mean substance
[1:22:34] Faith he is isolated from the entire
[1:22:37] world and becomes a new creature in
[1:22:39] Christ there now you're getting in the
[1:22:41] bride material you're getting into
[1:22:43] rapturing condition
[1:22:46] notice no God never put
[1:22:48] signs in front of the word but they
[1:22:50] followed that word
[1:22:52] follow that word you watch what happened
[1:22:53] up there with Moses what did he do he
[1:22:55] took God at his word he took his shoes
[1:22:57] off and he walked up there in the
[1:22:59] presence that Pillar of Fire you looked
[1:23:01] up there and Elijah or under Elijah's
[1:23:03] Ministry he walked up there when there
[1:23:06] hadn't been rain for three years ain't
[1:23:08] been fed by the Ravens for so long and
[1:23:10] God dried up his Cricket player and told
[1:23:13] him to go by that widow's house up there
[1:23:15] and when Elijah began to talk to her
[1:23:17] what was he doing he was making her
[1:23:19] language obey with him
[1:23:22] good morning Lord he was making her
[1:23:25] language obey with the word of God and
[1:23:27] that little woman he talked to her he
[1:23:30] said what are you doing she said I'm
[1:23:31] baking me a cake for me and my son to go
[1:23:33] and die but what did he say to her bake
[1:23:36] me a cake first what is it you put the
[1:23:38] word first and the word or the miracle
[1:23:41] will take place on the word
[1:23:44] signs follow the word but you got to put
[1:23:46] the word first and when you put the word
[1:23:48] first the miracle will take place after
[1:23:52] you take God at his word
[1:23:56] thank you
[1:23:58] when Daniel when you're looking Daniel
[1:24:01] chapter 5 and there you look at
[1:24:02] belshazzar and he has a feast what does
[1:24:04] he do he goes up there and he takes
[1:24:07] instruments out of the temple of God and
[1:24:10] brings him down there to his hoedown and
[1:24:12] has a party and he takes the things that
[1:24:14] should be in the temple of God and he
[1:24:16] puts them down there in his own
[1:24:18] so-called party and there that the Bible
[1:24:20] tells us that they are appearing a hand
[1:24:22] of a man and begin to write a certain
[1:24:25] language on the side of the wall of the
[1:24:27] plaster of the wall what was it there
[1:24:30] there brother Branham said in the
[1:24:32] handwriting of the wall a handwriting on
[1:24:34] the wall he said there belshazzar began
[1:24:37] to talk to his astronomers and his
[1:24:40] doctors of divinity and his so-called
[1:24:42] popes and Bishops and Cardinals of the
[1:24:44] day and said what does this tell us what
[1:24:46] does this mean to us
[1:24:49] but you see this was the entering into
[1:24:52] the Gentile Kingdom and only
[1:24:54] Supernatural things can be understood by
[1:24:57] our spiritual people
[1:24:59] and there those astronomers astrologers
[1:25:02] and soothsayers were up there running
[1:25:04] around trying to figure out what in the
[1:25:05] world is going on there they're beating
[1:25:07] her head trying to figure out what that
[1:25:09] says
[1:25:10] but there was a little old Queen
[1:25:12] there was a little old queen that
[1:25:14] brother Randall said she hadn't been in
[1:25:16] town or no rock and roll party she
[1:25:17] hadn't been down on no Honky Tonk she'd
[1:25:20] been up there and she came and brought
[1:25:22] peace to the king and said O King there
[1:25:25] is a man in your kingdom that is
[1:25:27] excellent in spirit he is a dissolver of
[1:25:31] doubts
[1:25:33] what was it Daniel understood the
[1:25:36] language of the one that was writing the
[1:25:38] word
[1:25:39] well Glory watch them seals mean to
[1:25:42] everybody else they don't understand it
[1:25:44] but what's been ruled over this
[1:25:46] generation it's a perfect language for
[1:25:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ she knows what
[1:25:52] he's saying to her
[1:25:54] the rest of the world looks out there
[1:25:56] and sees Christ riding on that white
[1:25:58] horse but you as a body of Jesus Christ
[1:26:00] understand that that's the Antichrist
[1:26:02] writing out there with a bow but he
[1:26:05] ain't got no arrows
[1:26:08] what am I saying to you the prophet was
[1:26:11] talking your language brother Jim
[1:26:12] [Applause]
[1:26:16] how is it so easy for you to believe
[1:26:20] because you are a jean seed of God
[1:26:24] how is it that little girl understood
[1:26:26] that there was somebody there it's
[1:26:28] because she had seen the dissolver of
[1:26:30] Doubt work
[1:26:32] you see a bill Sasson would have paid
[1:26:34] attention if he'd been out there where
[1:26:36] he should have been at as a king looking
[1:26:38] to a prophet he'd have been
[1:26:40] understanding where he could have went
[1:26:42] up there and got his doubts dissolved
[1:26:45] but I want to say this to you church
[1:26:46] that the dissolver of doubts is in this
[1:26:49] room this morning or this evening it's
[1:26:52] the devil's job to give you questions
[1:26:54] it's a devil's job to make it out it's a
[1:26:57] devil's job to make your unbeliever give
[1:26:59] you disbelief and make you doubt and
[1:27:01] make you fear the promises of God
[1:27:04] but the message is answer
[1:27:08] let me put it in your prophet's language
[1:27:10] you're the answer to the devil's
[1:27:13] question
[1:27:14] it's a devil's job brother Jonathan to
[1:27:17] bring questions but you're the answer
[1:27:23] Lord have mercy what is it what is it
[1:27:27] it's a dissolver of doubts are still
[1:27:29] working what was it when David was out
[1:27:31] there and the armies of God was
[1:27:33] paralyzed by fear and looking at Goliath
[1:27:35] sister Riley what was it there was a
[1:27:38] little old man that was a dissolver of
[1:27:40] doubts what what's Daniel down there in
[1:27:42] the Lion's Den he was the dissolver of
[1:27:45] doubts what is it when the enemy comes
[1:27:47] and tells you that God don't do Miracles
[1:27:49] no more God is a desire of doubts
[1:27:53] I don't even know how to talk that
[1:27:55] language
[1:28:01] Jay it's like me trying to teach Spanish
[1:28:03] it ain't gonna work

[1:28:32] job this week to be a Spanish teacher
[1:28:36] y'all didn't have a clue what I was
[1:28:37] talking about too I just told you is

[1:28:57] good English words every once in a while
[1:28:58] and I sometimes have a trouble speaking
[1:29:01] out sometimes I'm good at talking

[1:32:24] that heals all of your diseases he's in
[1:32:26] the building

[1:32:36] to you he said people say that the days
[1:32:38] of Miracles are passing
[1:32:40] he said it is for those that for that
[1:32:43] are out from underneath the blood
[1:32:45] he said but if you're underneath the
[1:32:47] blood the day he said if you're
[1:32:49] underneath the blood the days of
[1:32:50] Miracles are for you I don't know if you

[1:33:02] am I speaking your language tonight that
[1:33:04] that this is who who you are
[1:33:07] you're built to believe you're built to
[1:33:10] channel this when William Branham goes
[1:33:12] out there and that little girl
[1:33:13] recognizes who he is she ain't gonna let
[1:33:16] him go until he prays for it but brother
[1:33:18] Byron said I had to let her go he said
[1:33:21] because the Lord had to get her let me
[1:33:22] go so I could grab a hold of her he said
[1:33:24] because the Lord was dealing with me in
[1:33:26] a sign of the hand at that time and he
[1:33:27] said I had to have he said I had to have
[1:33:30] faith to know that her sight was
[1:33:33] returning back to her and he said when I
[1:33:35] took her by the hand he said I raised
[1:33:38] her eyes up he said I could feel that
[1:33:40] that Spirit of that tumor that was on
[1:33:43] her eye that it was completely gone and
[1:33:45] when she opened up her eyes she began to
[1:33:48] see completely and she was made whole
[1:33:50] the brother man said I walked over there
[1:33:52] in the corner he said there was an old
[1:33:54] man that had been laying there for eight
[1:33:56] days trying to get into the presence of
[1:34:00] the Healer he said he where he was he
[1:34:03] said his foot was all twisted up his leg
[1:34:04] was off to itself had all kinds of kids
[1:34:06] back home
[1:34:10] he said I have waited for this he's not
[1:34:13] waiting for this for eight days he said
[1:34:15] I ain't eating two days I've been
[1:34:16] sitting out here in this rain waiting
[1:34:18] for this moment
[1:34:21] what was it the one that was getting
[1:34:22] ready to talk his language
[1:34:27] he said Do you believe God can heal you
[1:34:30] he said if you believe God can heal you
[1:34:32] then hand me that cane and before he
[1:34:34] handed him that cane
[1:34:36] he started handing him that cane and
[1:34:38] when he had started handing him that
[1:34:39] cane all of a sudden his leg completely
[1:34:42] came straight and he took off running
[1:34:43] and shouting what are you willing to let
[1:34:45] go
[1:34:46] are you willing to let go of your crutch
[1:34:48] of of this I've disbelieved this for so
[1:34:51] long are you willing to let go of your
[1:34:52] crutch my my mama died this way my daddy
[1:34:54] died this way why don't you let them
[1:34:56] things go You Ain't Gotta Die the same
[1:34:58] way your daddy died you ain't got to
[1:35:00] live in the same cycle your mama lived
[1:35:03] here
[1:35:04] what are you willing to let go
[1:35:11] he said but oh if you only
[1:35:13] if you just rely on Hope You Hinder
[1:35:16] Faith he said hope looks for something
[1:35:18] way off but Faith claims it right now
[1:35:19] faith says God said so and it's mine
[1:35:21] that settled said I don't care if I'm if
[1:35:24] I'm still crippled I'm still blind if
[1:35:25] I'm still sick that don't have nothing
[1:35:28] to do with it
[1:35:30] I believe it anyhow it's mine right now
[1:35:32] God said so and that sells it that's
[1:35:34] faith
[1:35:35] but hope says God said so and I'm
[1:35:37] expecting to get it someday
[1:35:40] notice the difference between Faith and
[1:35:43] Hope hope is expecting to get it someday
[1:35:45] he said you see I'm expecting someday
[1:35:48] and he said as long as Satan can put you
[1:35:51] off to another day he said that's as
[1:35:53] good as he wants you see that's all
[1:35:55] satan wants is for you to put it off for
[1:35:57] another service put it off for getting
[1:35:59] things right for another day or for
[1:36:01] another time or or another moment when
[1:36:02] the prayer line That's what Satan was
[1:36:04] wanting you to do is put it off
[1:36:06] somewhere he said you'll never get it
[1:36:09] just believe that you got it right now
[1:36:11] it's your personal property faith is the
[1:36:15] substance of things hoped for the
[1:36:18] evidence of Things Not Seen is that
[1:36:20] right Faith acts now it's positive there
[1:36:23] oh my I tell you sickness and everything
[1:36:25] else when Faith steps in it's just like
[1:36:28] a snowball in a hot stove it just melts
[1:36:30] away everything goes away from Faith
[1:36:33] because Faith stands up and takes rule
[1:36:35] over it when Faith speaks everything
[1:36:37] else keep still that's right
[1:36:40] Faith only knows
[1:36:42] one language
[1:36:44] it's a word
[1:36:47] faith is a powerful thing
[1:36:50] faith in God
[1:36:52] can move a mountain mother burn them
[1:36:55] mother won't tell me he's in his room
[1:36:58] he's getting ready to go to a meeting
[1:37:00] and he and he's there and he and he
[1:37:03] starts becoming cognitive of that
[1:37:05] there's somebody standing outside the
[1:37:06] door and then they start talking in
[1:37:08] another language he said I heard it he
[1:37:10] said I heard it in German he said I
[1:37:12] heard it sounded like German something
[1:37:13] out there he said I tried to come to
[1:37:15] myself and and those things he said but
[1:37:17] he said when I come to it was me
[1:37:19] speaking in another language he said he
[1:37:22] said I had Soul he said he said I just
[1:37:24] set Real Steel and he said when he left
[1:37:26] me he said I felt like I could run
[1:37:27] through a troop and leap over a wall he
[1:37:30] said I never felt so good in all my life
[1:37:32] and and there Billy Paul was out there
[1:37:34] knocking on doors said Daddy they're
[1:37:36] ready for you down there and when when
[1:37:37] brother Brandon told him he said now
[1:37:39] just wait a minute just wait a minute
[1:37:40] let me get myself ready there he was
[1:37:41] speaking in another language and when he
[1:37:43] got down there to the meeting he said
[1:37:45] there was a he said they brought me a
[1:37:47] testimony that there was a sister out
[1:37:49] there that had tuberculosis he said she
[1:37:51] had tuberculosis and she was
[1:37:53] hemorrhaging and the doctor said that if
[1:37:55] she had one more Hemorrhage that she was
[1:37:57] going to die and she had gotten to such
[1:37:59] a place that the ambulance and the
[1:38:01] hospital said we're not going to allow
[1:38:03] you to leave this hospital room because
[1:38:04] if you have one more Hemorrhage you're
[1:38:06] going to die but there were some saints
[1:38:07] that gathered up some people there and
[1:38:09] put her in a station wagon and put her
[1:38:11] put her back there made her a spot where
[1:38:13] she could lie down back there and and
[1:38:16] then she got to coming down there she
[1:38:17] was going to that meeting and there when
[1:38:20] when she got to going down them roses
[1:38:21] probably out there in Arkansas and bad
[1:38:23] roads out there Oklahoma he's got her
[1:38:25] going down those roads and those roads
[1:38:27] were so rough it actually caused her to
[1:38:28] start hemorrhaging again
[1:38:30] and and then she she said she said I
[1:38:32] don't want to die here in this car she
[1:38:33] and her life was going down all the time
[1:38:35] going down she says I don't want to die
[1:38:36] here in the car so they pulled over on
[1:38:38] the side of the road and they just laid
[1:38:39] her out there laid her out there in the
[1:38:41] grass and and she and she was completely
[1:38:43] going down getting lower and lower all
[1:38:46] that time
[1:38:47] he said all of a sudden all of a sudden
[1:38:50] that little girl that girl that had
[1:38:52] dealt with that jumped up and started
[1:38:54] running back and forth down the street
[1:38:56] running back and forth down the street
[1:38:58] he said what was it he said I found out
[1:39:01] it was the same time that I was up there
[1:39:04] in my room talking in another language
[1:39:06] it was the same time that that girl was
[1:39:09] receiving her healing you may not
[1:39:12] understand why you go into intercessory
[1:39:14] prayers sometimes and you start talking
[1:39:16] in another language but maybe it's for
[1:39:18] somebody that's a cost a thousand miles
[1:39:21] away maybe it's for somebody in a
[1:39:23] meeting like tonight that you break out
[1:39:25] in faith
[1:39:28] maybe you don't understand why you're
[1:39:30] praying the way you're praying maybe you
[1:39:32] don't understand why you're praising the
[1:39:34] way you're praising but oh if you could
[1:39:36] break into a channel
[1:39:38] the language of the Holy Ghost comes
[1:39:41] upon you
[1:39:47] I'm saying to you it's time to tell the
[1:39:49] devil you changed your mind
[1:39:53] because the Bible said in Galatians 3
[1:39:56] and 13 that Christ has redeemed us from
[1:39:59] the curse of the law being made a curse
[1:40:02] for us for it is written that cursed is
[1:40:04] every one that hangeth on a tree
[1:40:07] if you go to studying out Deuteronomy
[1:40:09] chapter 28 you'll find that that is a
[1:40:12] that is a chapter of blessings
[1:40:15] and cursings
[1:40:16] and if you go to studying it out there's
[1:40:18] more curses
[1:40:20] that come from disobeying God then there
[1:40:22] is blessings that come from obeying God
[1:40:25] but if you go to studying that out
[1:40:27] you'll find in there there's pestilence
[1:40:29] that came from disobeying God's God on
[1:40:32] God's word tuberculosis there's fever
[1:40:34] there there's inflammation there's
[1:40:36] extreme burning there's Bots there's
[1:40:38] hemorrhoids there's scabs there's itches
[1:40:40] there's blindness there's smiting in the
[1:40:42] knee and in the leg and and the failing
[1:40:43] of the eyes and if you really want to
[1:40:45] find who you are if you can't find your
[1:40:47] disease and all of those scriptures here
[1:40:49] go to Deuteronomy 28 and 60 and 61
[1:40:52] you'll find that all of them diseases
[1:40:54] that you have or have been down
[1:40:56] throughout history are laying right
[1:40:58] there in that chapter
[1:41:01] laughs
[1:41:03] that's a weird way to end of service oh
[1:41:06] no it ain't
[1:41:08] because Paul said that Christ redeemed
[1:41:12] us from these curses
[1:41:15] now you look at your family history and
[1:41:17] you look at your DNA and you look at
[1:41:19] what you battle with you see that as a
[1:41:22] curse you see those things but the Bible
[1:41:24] said that Christ redeemed you from the
[1:41:26] curse of the law because he was made a
[1:41:28] curse for you you see the curse of the
[1:41:30] law it included all diseases every
[1:41:33] sickness every plague known throughout
[1:41:35] the history of the world in order for
[1:41:37] Christ to redeem us from this terrible
[1:41:38] curse of the law he was made a curse for
[1:41:41] us
[1:41:42] so Christ bore our punishment that was
[1:41:47] prescribed by the law that is why he had
[1:41:49] to take our infirmities and bear our
[1:41:51] sickness when Adam and Eve sold us into
[1:41:53] slavery the devil put us into bondage
[1:41:56] according to his power but the Bible
[1:41:58] said Christ redeemed us he brought us
[1:42:01] back what did he do he purchased us with
[1:42:04] a price of his own body and blood for
[1:42:07] you are bought with a price therefore
[1:42:09] glorify God in your body
[1:42:12] what am I saying to you that Jesus
[1:42:15] becoming your curse is your freedom
[1:42:19] it's time you start telling the devil
[1:42:21] I'm changing my language for the good
[1:42:22] I'm changing my mind salvation is my
[1:42:25] freedom
[1:42:26] salvation is my freedom Christ is my
[1:42:30] savior Christ is my healer Christ is my
[1:42:33] Waymaker what is it it's time that you
[1:42:36] start confessing that and start speaking
[1:42:39] the language of winter
[1:42:42] what is it confess your freedom instead
[1:42:45] of your bondage confess with his stripes
[1:42:47] I'm Healed instead of your sickness
[1:42:49] confess your Redemption from every
[1:42:51] disease confess that you are Redemption
[1:42:53] is complete free in Christ Jesus
[1:42:57] confess that Satan's dominion over you
[1:42:59] ended at Calvary
[1:43:01] what am I saying to you you've got to
[1:43:03] turn your mouth loose to confess it
[1:43:07] you've got to change your language what
[1:43:09] happened up there on the day of
[1:43:11] Pentecost it changed their language
[1:43:13] where they were talking the language of
[1:43:15] a coward and they come out with The
[1:43:17] Bravery of the Lion of the tribe of
[1:43:19] Judah what am I saying to you you are
[1:43:22] not alone no longer a slave to your fear
[1:43:26] when the slaves of the United States
[1:43:28] when they begin to hear when they when
[1:43:30] they begin to hear about the
[1:43:31] Emancipation they begin to hear about it
[1:43:34] they were still slaves living in slave
[1:43:37] quarters they still look like slaves
[1:43:39] they still felt like slaves but when the
[1:43:42] Emancipation Proclamation was read and
[1:43:46] put into legal rights they had every
[1:43:48] legal right to say that I am free
[1:43:51] I am free I'm no longer a slave I can
[1:43:55] act on my Liberty that's why Paul would
[1:43:57] say Stand Fast therefore in your Liberty
[1:43:59] where Christ has made you free so you
[1:44:02] have every ability to stand there say
[1:44:04] I'm free I'm not bound I'm not going
[1:44:08] back to that kind of a living
[1:44:10] what am I saying to you if you can
[1:44:13] change your language you can change
[1:44:15] Dimensions if you can change your faith
[1:44:17] you can change places with somebody else
[1:44:21] what would AI Elvis right to do today
[1:44:23] he'd like to change places with somebody
[1:44:25] else
[1:44:26] what would Marilyn Monroe like to do
[1:44:28] today she'd like to change places with
[1:44:30] somebody else
[1:44:31] but you gun girls if you can change your
[1:44:34] dress it'll change your conduct
[1:44:36] if you can change what you're listening
[1:44:38] to you can change your atmosphere if you
[1:44:40] can stop talking the devil's language
[1:44:42] and start talking the mighty Angels
[1:44:44] message start talking what he said about
[1:44:47] you start saying what he believed in you
[1:44:50] I am an offspring of God I am a gene
[1:44:53] seed of God I'm born to live this
[1:44:55] message I am an overcomer
[1:45:01] thank you
[1:45:03] I'm not dead to this no more
[1:45:06] I'm not dead to this kind of talking no
[1:45:08] more
[1:45:11] I'm free
[1:45:14] I know that now if you I'm going to
[1:45:16] close with this thought right here
[1:45:19] you want to ever go and go do a study at
[1:45:21] the message throughout the message
[1:45:22] that'll bless you just go do a study on
[1:45:24] that kind of faith
[1:45:27] on that kind of Faith he said that's
[1:45:30] Christ's attitude is that exactly the
[1:45:33] same to you today as it was at Calvary
[1:45:35] he said he's here to heal you this night
[1:45:38] he said maybe you might not have that
[1:45:41] spontaneous Faith to bring something
[1:45:44] he just just a miracle right to you you
[1:45:47] may not have that kind of Faith but
[1:45:50] Jesus said if you had the faith like a
[1:45:51] mustard seed you could say to this
[1:45:53] mountain be moved and buy it it would
[1:45:55] come to pass it wouldn't it wouldn't
[1:45:57] vanish it away but by and by it'll come
[1:46:01] to pass maybe you ain't got the kind of
[1:46:04] Faith like some of these other brothers
[1:46:05] and sisters guy but if you got that kind
[1:46:07] of faith
[1:46:08] if you got that kind of Faith that's
[1:46:11] God's language
[1:46:12] remember when those enemies that were
[1:46:14] down there and there were the lepers
[1:46:16] that were down there and they were they
[1:46:18] were sitting there at the gate and they
[1:46:19] were sitting there dying in their
[1:46:21] conditions and they began to say well I
[1:46:24] said we here until we die why don't we
[1:46:27] go down to the house of our enemy maybe
[1:46:30] if we'll go down there maybe they'll
[1:46:32] have mercy upon us and brother banham
[1:46:34] said that when they went down there God
[1:46:37] upon the merits of that kind of Faith
[1:46:39] rewarded them and caused a great Rumble
[1:46:42] to come upon the desert and they thought
[1:46:45] that Israel had hired some soldiers to
[1:46:47] come out there and they ran and they
[1:46:49] went into the tents and found life found
[1:46:51] food and found wine
[1:46:52] not only did they save their own lives
[1:46:55] but they saved the city's life
[1:46:57] with that kind of faith it ran the enemy
[1:47:01] off of their ground
[1:47:05] he said I'm telling you he said but
[1:47:08] you've not come to the house of the
[1:47:09] enemy tonight
[1:47:11] you've come to
[1:47:12] London to the father
[1:47:15] oh come on
[1:47:17] what is surrounding you if you can have
[1:47:20] that kind of faith
[1:47:23] well if you could have that kind of
[1:47:25] Faith you're not at the enemy's house
[1:47:28] you're at the father's house
[1:47:33] oh and Martha and Mary were in a bad
[1:47:37] condition
[1:47:41] when Jesus come walking to them
[1:47:43] they said even now
[1:47:45] I believe that you can make my brother
[1:47:48] rise again
[1:47:52] brother Burnham said with that kind of
[1:47:54] faith
[1:47:56] he said something was going to happen
[1:48:00] what was it
[1:48:02] only believe
[1:48:06] sometimes we try to make Faith so so big
[1:48:10] well faith is really
[1:48:12] it's real so simple
[1:48:14] people try to work themselves up into
[1:48:16] believing
[1:48:17] but you got here
[1:48:19] you had enough Faith to start your car
[1:48:21] you had enough Faith to get here
[1:48:25] what would happen tonight if you just
[1:48:27] begin to
[1:48:29] change your language
[1:48:31] to the redeemed of the Lord
[1:48:34] every situation around you would begin
[1:48:36] to crumple and the enemy began to run
[1:48:39] if you just change your language
[1:48:42] well I've been sick for so long
[1:48:44] Once you turn that around and say I've
[1:48:46] been healed for 2000 years
[1:48:52] we stopped changing we we started
[1:48:54] changing our language
[1:48:58] we started changing our language that
[1:48:59] Zoe hasn't spoke yet to Zoe is speaking
[1:49:04] well you're you're really you're really
[1:49:06] you're really not telling the truth
[1:49:08] there brother Andrew have you heard her
[1:49:10] talk
[1:49:12] that little girl starting to talk
[1:49:16] I began to tell a testimony about sister
[1:49:18] Whitney's healing while I was up here in
[1:49:21] Canada a while back and I started
[1:49:22] talking about y'all remember y'all was
[1:49:23] down here at that tent meeting brother
[1:49:24] Sean's a couple years ago and Whitney
[1:49:27] come through there had that had that uh
[1:49:28] condition where she couldn't hardly eat
[1:49:30] anything she she had done she was on a
[1:49:32] crazy strict diet
[1:49:33] and I began to tell that story how the
[1:49:36] angel Lord met Whitney over there at the
[1:49:38] side of that tent
[1:49:39] and I don't know how many maybe it was a
[1:49:42] couple of them we begin to I don't
[1:49:45] remember but we were going to talk we're
[1:49:46] going to talk about that was I believe I
[1:49:48] know at least two sisters came up said
[1:49:50] I'm dealing with the same exact thing
[1:49:51] you can go listen to a testimony up here
[1:49:53] at Cloverdale and you can hear that God
[1:49:56] used that testimony
[1:49:58] to bring healing to those two girls
[1:50:00] maybe more than that I don't know I
[1:50:02] began to talk about I began to talk
[1:50:04] about brother album backer I had a bad
[1:50:06] skin disease had had to add scabs on his
[1:50:08] hands and everything else and there was
[1:50:09] Brothers up there I I think I prayed for
[1:50:11] maybe seven boys that had the same
[1:50:14] condition but because of the power of
[1:50:17] faith of somebody else realizing that
[1:50:20] God was a god of the Bible it changes
[1:50:24] your whole language I don't know when
[1:50:27] and I don't know how but I know He'll Do
[1:50:29] It Again
[1:50:31] let's stand
[1:50:39] what did Jesus do
[1:50:41] when he brought those disciples up there
[1:50:43] on the day of Pentecost
[1:50:47] brother Brandon said in the Easter seal
[1:50:48] he said he took the fear out of them
[1:50:51] and made them believe
[1:50:53] he took the fear out of them and
[1:50:55] quickened them to live
[1:50:57] so I don't know how to talk that kind of
[1:50:59] language I'm not I'm not necessarily
[1:51:01] good like you I don't listen to all them
[1:51:03] sermons like you
[1:51:06] you can you can do that that ain't too
[1:51:08] hard to do if I can figure out how to do
[1:51:11] it I know you can't well brother Andrew
[1:51:13] I'm just a simple person if God can take
[1:51:15] a possum brother Doug
[1:51:18] if God can take a possum that don't talk
[1:51:21] English
[1:51:22] that don't understand Kentucky hillbilly
[1:51:24] talk
[1:51:25] but he can make her have something on
[1:51:28] the inside of her that would cause her
[1:51:30] to go by prophet's door
[1:51:33] if he can have a little insignificant
[1:51:36] possum to believe that there is a
[1:51:39] scripture that says they shall lay hands
[1:51:41] on the sick and they shall recover that
[1:51:42] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[1:51:44] there was something on the inside of
[1:51:46] that nature that made her understand the
[1:51:49] prophet's language
[1:51:53] she been sitting out there
[1:51:55] all of them hours
[1:51:57] those those little babies nursing the
[1:52:00] very life out of her
[1:52:03] and when brother Bynum kneeled down and
[1:52:05] prayed for her she jumped up
[1:52:08] walked down to the aisle walk down to
[1:52:10] the end of the walkway and she'd look
[1:52:12] back as to thank him
[1:52:14] if a possum had enough ability to turn
[1:52:17] around and thank God
[1:52:19] what what would you do
[1:52:22] if God can take an insignificant possum
[1:52:25] if God can take an insignificant little
[1:52:27] fish
[1:52:28] and bring life back to it if God can
[1:52:30] talk to a storm through a prophet's lips
[1:52:35] what am I saying to you the third pull
[1:52:37] is not some great big workup
[1:52:41] it's not something that's so high that
[1:52:43] only preachers and a scholar message
[1:52:45] Believers can attain
[1:52:47] he'll take a heavy right
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:52:49] he'll take a handy right and make the
[1:52:52] third pool operate
[1:52:54] it ain't something way up there where
[1:52:56] you gotta have an education an
[1:52:57] intellectual talk
[1:52:58] the third pool is for you
[1:53:02] I'll be honest
[1:53:04] I'm so glad
[1:53:06] that this Prophet knew my language
[1:53:10] he didn't come to me with some scholarly
[1:53:12] ideas
[1:53:13] [Music]
[1:53:15] but he talks
[1:53:17] talk my kind of language
[1:53:19] and you can take this prophet's message
[1:53:21] and put it in every country
[1:53:24] and every person no matter high or low
[1:53:29] can comprehend this message
[1:53:31] why because a holy ghost it doesn't
[1:53:33] matter what country or what continent
[1:53:35] you're in the Holy Ghost
[1:53:38] speaks the same language
