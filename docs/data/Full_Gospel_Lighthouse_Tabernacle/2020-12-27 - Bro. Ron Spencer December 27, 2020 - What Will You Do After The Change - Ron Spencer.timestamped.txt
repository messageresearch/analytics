[42:29] amen if you would turn with me in your
[42:31] scriptures to
[42:32] revelations chapter 21 and verse 1 this
[42:35] morning then revelations chapter 3
[42:37] and verse 12.
[42:43] i'd like to ask you a question what will
[42:46] you do
[42:47] after the change
[42:50] the ultimate question is many have great
[42:54] intentions
[42:56] incredible abilities but they're never
[42:59] committed
[43:05] what will you do after the change
[43:09] jesus said behold i make all things new
[43:12] amen amen revelation chapter 21
[43:16] and verse 1 and i saw a new heaven and a
[43:19] new earth
[43:21] for the first heavens and the first
[43:22] earth were passed away
[43:24] and there was no more sea and i john saw
[43:28] the holy city the new jerusalem coming
[43:30] down from god out of heaven
[43:32] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[43:34] husband
[43:35] i heard a great voice out of heaven
[43:37] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[43:39] with
[43:40] men and he will dwell with them and they
[43:42] shall be his people
[43:44] and god himself shall be with them be
[43:47] their god
[43:48] it's hard to think of it that's such a
[43:51] future
[43:52] forecast vision prophecy
[43:55] but one day that'll be reality and this
[43:58] will be history
[44:05] one day that will be real
[44:10] amen and in the vision i'm there
[44:15] in the vision i'm there hallelujah
[44:18] i like that i like to read i like to
[44:21] read my future
[44:23] and god shall wipe away all tears
[44:27] from their eyes and there shall be no
[44:29] more death
[44:31] neither sorrow nor crying and neither
[44:33] shall there be any more pain
[44:35] for the former things are passed away
[44:41] i could close right there and just shout
[44:44] the rest of the day
[44:47] and he that set up on the throne said
[44:49] behold i make all things new
[44:51] and he said unto me write for these
[44:53] things these words are
[44:56] true and faithful
[44:59] and he said unto me it is done i am
[45:02] alpha
[45:03] and omega the beginning and the end and
[45:06] i will give unto him that is a thirst
[45:08] of the fountain of the water of life
[45:11] freely
[45:13] and he that overcometh shall inherit
[45:18] all things and i will be his god
[45:21] and he shall be my son you see what
[45:25] you're doing here
[45:26] now is overcoming
[45:29] how many of you even in christmas week
[45:31] had some trials to go through
[45:34] really are you expecting any this coming
[45:38] week
[45:40] yeah yeah yeah so that is part of the
[45:43] scripture that has just been read
[45:46] overcometh all things
[45:49] to be able to live there revelations 3
[45:53] and verse 12
[45:54] and he that overcometh will i make a
[45:57] pillar
[45:57] in the temple of my god
[46:01] and he shall go no more out and i write
[46:05] unto him the name of my god
[46:07] and the name of the city of my god which
[46:10] is the new jerusalem
[46:12] which cometh down out of heaven from my
[46:14] god
[46:15] and i will write unto him my
[46:18] new name you may be seated this evening
[46:21] may god bless the reading of his word
[46:24] amen we certainly love you with all of
[46:27] our hearts
[46:28] wasn't it nice last week to have the
[46:30] dinner together where we were all kind
[46:32] of
[46:32] we were all kind of together that was
[46:34] just really nice and
[46:36] we're looking forward to the day where
[46:37] we can be back together again maybe
[46:39] that's not going to be too far off from
[46:41] now but
[46:42] we're looking forward to that time to
[46:44] where we can be together
[46:46] we realize in the scriptures that god is
[46:48] the same yesterday today and forever
[46:51] the scripture takes us all the way from
[46:53] in the beginning
[46:55] and then the prophet's message took us
[46:58] before the beginning
[47:01] to where that god wasn't even god
[47:04] to where that there was nothing to
[47:06] worship him he dwelt along with these
[47:08] attributes
[47:10] now being god if we were ever with him
[47:13] we'll never be without him so god saw us
[47:17] then
[47:18] then he watched over our parent lineage
[47:21] all the way down through
[47:23] time and and all the way through the
[47:25] genetics and watched over every
[47:27] situation of our life and
[47:29] and some of us were disasters
[47:33] all of us wants to be kind to george
[47:34] washington or
[47:36] kin to some king somewhere another but
[47:39] you know most of us were disasters
[47:41] bootleggers and drunks and prostitutes
[47:45] was in our family tree
[47:46] and some traitors and some different
[47:49] cult
[47:50] situations all of us would have liked to
[47:52] had a prophet in our
[47:53] in our in our bloodline but but most of
[47:57] us
[47:59] for the most of us you know we were just
[48:02] pulpers coming down through
[48:04] but god rich in his mercy watched over
[48:07] us brother mike
[48:08] he watched over us as it came down
[48:10] through angelic
[48:13] beings watched over that human
[48:16] embryo as it was coming down the line
[48:21] now notice you're not alone in some of
[48:24] these trappings
[48:25] as as brother andrew were talking about
[48:27] some of the past
[48:29] if you remember in your first marriage
[48:31] of your first nature
[48:33] you were born in sin we put two
[48:35] scriptures together here
[48:37] you were born in sin you were shaping an
[48:40] iniquity
[48:41] [Applause]
[48:43] that's how you came into the earth it
[48:45] was a it was
[48:47] by that shape and an iniquity you came
[48:50] into the world you spoke lies nobody had
[48:52] to train you to do that
[48:54] your first nature was wicked uh
[48:57] your first nature took you in a lot of
[48:59] different directions
[49:00] made choices that some of you wouldn't
[49:02] make today
[49:03] but it made choices because the king
[49:07] that was sitting on your heart the ruler
[49:10] which you thought that was just you
[49:14] but it was actually by perverted birth
[49:17] you were being led by that first
[49:19] nature and it constantly kept you in
[49:22] trouble
[49:23] and maybe there were times that you felt
[49:25] a leading for god
[49:27] and you would get close to god but
[49:29] because that king that was on the heart
[49:31] was still alive there and jesus hasn't
[49:35] become the king of the heart
[49:36] then you constantly made up and down
[49:39] mistakes and failures
[49:41] in and out of church doing this doing
[49:43] that and a
[49:44] constant disappointment to yourself
[49:48] could i have a good hearty amen right
[49:50] now
[49:51] it's because the king that was over top
[49:54] of your book of your nature
[49:56] was was the satan himself
[50:00] from that first birth
[50:04] are you with me now
[50:08] let's just let's just read some
[50:10] scripture uh andrew read it
[50:13] he went over some of this but andrew
[50:15] read some of this
[50:16] the book of the generation of jesus
[50:19] christ
[50:20] the son of david the son of abraham
[50:24] and abraham beget isaac and isaac beget
[50:28] jacob
[50:29] and jacob beget judas and his brethren
[50:32] and judas beget feyrez and zayar
[50:36] of tamar and you remember what she did
[50:42] because there was something on the
[50:45] inside of her that was
[50:46] driving her that she would carry on the
[50:49] lineage
[50:50] of jesus christ
[50:54] let me just say this to you sometimes
[50:56] god just drives you
[50:57] and you can't figure out what in the
[50:59] world is going on
[51:02] you're just driven you're driven there's
[51:05] something inside of you you're
[51:07] driven and you find out later as you
[51:10] look
[51:11] back it was god driving you
[51:17] even her own father-in-law
[51:20] that wanted to have her life taken
[51:24] recognized that she was more righteous
[51:26] than him
[51:28] but yet she would play the part of a
[51:30] harlot
[51:32] because the blood of jesus christ
[51:35] was speaking of better things
[51:38] the seed of god was pressing its way
[51:41] through
[51:42] and it had to go through her womb
[51:46] there was not another womb that it could
[51:48] go through
[51:50] just like abraham's seed had to go
[51:52] through
[51:53] sarah's womb though it seemed to be
[51:56] impossible that's the way that it would
[51:59] go through
[52:17] and begat salmon
[52:20] and salmon beget boaz
[52:24] of rahab
[52:28] now let me just say this to you jesus
[52:32] had to be born in bethlehem
[52:36] but here's a woman on the wall at
[52:38] jericho
[52:40] and she has a before life
[52:43] like you had a history
[52:47] and she had a history and i'm not gonna
[52:49] i'm not gonna drive these things along
[52:51] but she had a history but god went
[52:54] looking at her history
[52:57] because she her womb would carry the
[53:01] seed
[53:02] of the motherhood of jesus christ
[53:08] are you with me and there would be life
[53:11] after prostitution
[53:14] there would be life after a supernatural
[53:17] experience with the token
[53:19] she wouldn't just go decades there was a
[53:22] line there was a
[53:23] a line that i was put for a token and
[53:26] all of my household
[53:27] would be saved and she'd tell that
[53:29] testimony
[53:30] after that and after that and after that
[53:33] but let me just say this you
[53:34] she became the wife of a captain
[53:38] [Applause]
[53:40] and they would settle a community where
[53:42] they would raise the best bread
[53:44] and have the most purest water and this
[53:47] was the place that
[53:48] jesus christ would be born
[53:52] there would be a time to where she was
[53:54] not recognized
[53:56] or even thought of as rahab
[54:00] the prostitute
[54:04] oh if you and i could get to that spot
[54:06] in our lives
[54:07] we're no longer looked at as the past
[54:10] failure
[54:12] we're no longer looked at as our past
[54:14] life
[54:15] or our past scars or our past conditions
[54:20] hallelujah the situation's the trials
[54:24] that you went through
[54:25] listen they just helped mold you to what
[54:28] you needed to be
[54:29] but there's life after all of that
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:36] hallelujah
[54:44] ruth is mentioned
[54:48] but she's not going to be recognized as
[54:50] a moabitus
[54:52] after a certain period of her life
[54:57] she's going to be married into a lineage
[55:00] and her kinsmen redeemer is going to pay
[55:02] for all her past
[55:04] and it's going to be a type of jesus
[55:07] christ in the bride
[55:13] the scripture now the next scripture
[55:15] talks about jesse beget
[55:16] david the king and david the king begat
[55:20] solomon of her
[55:24] that had been the wife of uriahs
[55:29] if you remember what brother random said
[55:31] about uriahs
[55:32] he was such a righteous man he was a
[55:35] gentile
[55:36] man fighting in the kingdom of david
[55:40] listen by the laws of the old testament
[55:44] didn't even have a right in the kingdom
[55:48] are you with me he didn't have a right
[55:51] but he had gave his
[55:52] life for the throne of david
[55:57] and even being the man when when the
[55:59] real trial comes down
[56:01] refuses to go lay with his wife
[56:05] because men were dying for the kingdom
[56:09] and he felt like he needed to be at war
[56:14] and it was david would become a murderer
[56:18] sending this righteous man
[56:22] because david had impregnated his wife
[56:29] are you with me you think you've got
[56:32] history
[56:38] i hear people talk about brother branham
[56:40] made some mistakes you haven't read your
[56:42] bible very well
[56:45] you're just stupid
[56:50] i don't mean to be hard you're just
[56:51] being stupid
[56:53] but brother brandon made mistakes she
[56:55] did
[56:57] what did you think he's a man his father
[57:00] was a bootlegger
[57:03] his family wound up many of them in
[57:05] prison
[57:07] brother branham would have been a
[57:08] murderer had that gun went off
[57:10] he'd have killed those six boys he meant
[57:12] to do it
[57:17] brother branham exaggerated you do too
[57:25] brother brown sometimes the whole story
[57:26] is different he was a human being
[57:29] wake up
[57:34] i don't know who that's for but there it
[57:36] is
[57:39] brother brown had a life before and he
[57:40] had a history and he was just
[57:42] honest he was
[57:45] just honest well brother ron have you
[57:48] looked on the internet and seen all the
[57:49] brother brown mistakes
[57:51] yeah can i look on the internet and see
[57:53] yours
[57:54] [Applause]
[58:25] there was a man standing in the office
[58:27] giving me some grief
[58:29] one time about this message
[58:34] and i felt a little something hit me
[58:37] and i just stood up from my table and i
[58:41] just looked at him and i said would you
[58:42] like for me to call the names of the
[58:44] women
[58:44] that you've committed adultery with
[58:56] and he just stepped out
[59:00] all of a sudden brother branham's
[59:01] problems wasn't too big of a problem
[59:08] and i'm just a man with a gift you're
[59:10] going to meet god
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:15] you don't have to impress me i'm just a
[59:17] man with a gift
[59:19] but one day you're going to meet god
[59:21] with that
[59:35] interesting brother branham would say
[59:36] that uriah would be the man
[59:38] the first man he wanted to shake hands
[59:40] with
[59:42] of all of the prophets
[59:45] of all the gallant gallant men
[59:50] uriahs is the man
[59:55] that he wants to meet
[1:00:03] last night we were
[1:00:06] sitting in the office
[1:00:10] and i was thinking about the sermon that
[1:00:12] i have today
[1:00:15] and i want to i'm going to bring i'm
[1:00:17] going to bring something to you
[1:00:19] in a realm to where that you'll get it
[1:00:23] when brother homer was here he was the
[1:00:26] he was the founder of this church some
[1:00:28] of you don't know him
[1:00:30] but he had a heart as big as this
[1:00:32] building
[1:00:34] he was driven he was a powerful man
[1:00:39] or an extremely gifted man
[1:00:43] but also there were times that you could
[1:00:45] see god
[1:00:46] and there was times you could see man
[1:00:50] now sister nancy would probably be the
[1:00:53] one that could point out more than
[1:00:54] anybody of the man part
[1:01:02] even the times that homer disappointed
[1:01:08] himself
[1:01:11] but today
[1:01:16] he stands with generals
[1:01:22] are you with me it would be no good for
[1:01:25] you to throw a stone at him
[1:01:31] as a matter of fact it would be a waste
[1:01:33] of your human energy
[1:01:35] to throw a stone at his past life
[1:01:40] and maybe some of the failures of his
[1:01:42] past life
[1:01:44] are you getting what i'm doing here
[1:01:47] are you with me so what they are doing
[1:01:50] to brother branham
[1:01:51] or to moses or to david throwing stones
[1:01:55] at past
[1:01:56] life or at brother homer
[1:01:59] to throw stones at a man's past life
[1:02:02] that's gone
[1:02:13] now if you can only get this what about
[1:02:15] your present life
[1:02:19] wipe those stones at your past life
[1:02:22] enjoy your present life
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:26] glory
[1:02:33] now let me just caution you here just
[1:02:35] for a moment
[1:02:36] we can sing about streets of gold and
[1:02:39] dancing and
[1:02:40] and doing those things and looking to
[1:02:42] the future
[1:02:43] sitting at the marriage supper of the
[1:02:45] lamb sitting at the white throne
[1:02:46] judgment
[1:02:47] and not being judged and sitting in the
[1:02:50] in the new world
[1:02:54] and everything being forgotten in the
[1:02:56] past forgotten
[1:02:57] but you're not there yet but
[1:03:00] neither are you back yonder as a drunk
[1:03:04] or a prostitute
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:09] neither are you a liar or a cheater
[1:03:12] but you are an overcomer of laodicea
[1:03:22] so the tick of the clock let it pick
[1:03:26] overcome one day at a time
[1:03:29] if you get knocked down get back up
[1:03:31] again
[1:03:38] hallelujah that'll require times when
[1:03:41] you come to church you don't feel
[1:03:42] nothing
[1:03:43] but you know he's healed that'll require
[1:03:46] times when you feel sick and you're
[1:03:48] worshiping the lord
[1:03:49] and you're clapping your hands and it's
[1:03:51] going to be a worship unto god
[1:03:54] and you jump into the service and the
[1:03:56] week before you
[1:03:58] has been ragged and tough but you come
[1:04:01] to church
[1:04:02] and you break through that realm
[1:04:08] and you break into the spirit of god
[1:04:11] and you begin to worship the lord and
[1:04:14] create an
[1:04:15] atmosphere around you
[1:04:17] [Applause]
[1:04:23] paul said this for i reckon that the
[1:04:25] sufferings of this present time
[1:04:27] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:04:29] glory which shall be revealed in us
[1:04:32] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:04:34] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:04:37] the sons of god
[1:04:39] for the creature was not me was made
[1:04:41] subject to vanity
[1:04:43] not willing but by reason of him who had
[1:04:46] subjected the same in hope
[1:04:48] because the creature itself also shall
[1:04:51] be delivered
[1:04:52] under the bondage of corruption and the
[1:04:54] glorious liberty of the
[1:04:56] of the children of god for we know that
[1:04:59] the whole creation
[1:05:01] groaneth and travaileth in pain together
[1:05:03] until now
[1:05:04] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:05:07] which have the first fruits of the
[1:05:09] spirit even ourselves grown within
[1:05:11] ourselves
[1:05:12] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:05:15] redemption
[1:05:17] of our body
[1:05:20] i want to give you another example that
[1:05:22] brother branham gave us every almost
[1:05:24] every service
[1:05:26] now jacob's well was there
[1:05:29] and jesus therefore being wearied with
[1:05:32] his journey set
[1:05:33] thus on the well and it was about the
[1:05:35] sixth hour
[1:05:37] there cometh a woman of samaria to draw
[1:05:39] water and jesus said unto her give me a
[1:05:42] drink
[1:05:43] for the disciples were going away to the
[1:05:45] city to buy meat
[1:05:47] and then the woman's of samaria
[1:05:50] then saith the woman of samaria how was
[1:05:53] it that thou
[1:05:54] being a jew asketh drink of me
[1:05:59] which i'm a woman of samaria for the
[1:06:02] jews have no dealings with samaritans
[1:06:07] but let me just say as a christian
[1:06:10] we don't have race issues
[1:06:18] jesus answered and said unto her if thou
[1:06:22] knewest
[1:06:25] the gift of god if you could capture the
[1:06:28] moment that you're living in
[1:06:32] can you i just want to just bring you
[1:06:34] into the thought this morning
[1:06:36] if you can get past your five husbands
[1:06:41] and recognize who you're talking to in
[1:06:43] this moment
[1:06:44] your future will be different
[1:06:49] [Applause]
[1:06:53] then she recognized after a conversation
[1:06:57] of who he was that he was the christ
[1:07:00] he was the messiah she recognized
[1:07:03] something that the priest in the city
[1:07:05] had not recognized
[1:07:13] in 28 the scripture says this that the
[1:07:16] woman
[1:07:18] then left her water pot
[1:07:22] and went her way into the city
[1:07:25] and saith to men come
[1:07:28] see a man
[1:07:31] which told me all things
[1:07:35] that i ever did
[1:07:38] is this not the christ
[1:07:45] now this woman is going to go
[1:07:48] it's not going to take her two years
[1:07:52] to figure out who she is
[1:07:56] it's not going to take a bunch of
[1:07:58] psychology
[1:08:01] it's not going to take books of learning
[1:08:06] the disciples can't figure out why he's
[1:08:08] even talking to her
[1:08:10] but this woman is going to do something
[1:08:13] that none of them's done
[1:08:15] she's going to lead thousands to christ
[1:08:20] [Applause]
[1:08:22] in coming days
[1:08:27] somebody ought to shout somebody ought
[1:08:30] to shout
[1:08:31] not 10 years from now not one day i
[1:08:34] intend to do something for god listen
[1:08:37] within
[1:08:38] moments she went into the city
[1:08:41] not recognized as a harlot no more but
[1:08:44] she had been with jesus
[1:08:47] and when you've been with jesus it
[1:08:49] changes your atmosphere
[1:08:51] it changes everything about you
[1:08:55] and she led thousands to jesus christ
[1:09:04] glory
[1:09:08] last week we talked about shepherds
[1:09:14] but the scripture tells us emphatically
[1:09:17] that these people begin to travel all
[1:09:19] about
[1:09:20] saying that we met an angel of the lord
[1:09:23] and then we went to bethlehem and we saw
[1:09:26] the christ
[1:09:26] child and then they begin to spread the
[1:09:30] news
[1:09:31] all over their country that we're not
[1:09:33] looking for jesus to come
[1:09:36] are we not looking for a messiah to be

[1:09:59] brother branham tells us about his
[1:10:00] angelic visitation in a cave
[1:10:04] he could have stayed there and said i
[1:10:07] met an angel
[1:10:08] but it impacted the rest of his life
[1:10:12] and in prayer line after prayer line
[1:10:14] when he couldn't break through
[1:10:16] he would remind the devil
[1:10:21] you know that i met an angel of god in a
[1:10:24] cave
[1:10:25] and he commissioned me
[1:10:29] so he had passed the cave experience
[1:10:34] come on so many times listen let me just
[1:10:37] say this message was more than about
[1:10:39] christ the mystery of god revealed
[1:10:41] mighty god unveiled leadership communion
[1:10:44] and all of those sermons
[1:10:45] those sermons were more than just
[1:10:47] preached
[1:10:49] there was a bride that would come on the
[1:10:51] scene
[1:10:53] and not just be identified with elijah
[1:10:55] this day
[1:10:56] but would eat the book and then
[1:11:00] live the book and prophesy again to the

[1:11:31] she's living in this bright age she is
[1:11:34] overcoming every day
[1:11:52] hallelujah brother brown would tell a
[1:11:55] story about
[1:11:56] here some time ago the religions of the
[1:11:58] world met
[1:12:00] and he said i was reading in a book
[1:12:07] bring me something that's got some sugar
[1:12:08] in it
[1:12:11] i was reading in a book that they had
[1:12:14] this lady maccabee
[1:12:16] from oklahoma that's arrested out here
[1:12:20] that might
[1:12:23] that might have been in tulsa or one of
[1:12:24] these places she was running through the
[1:12:26] street driving a stagecoach
[1:12:29] smoking a cigar breaking the speed
[1:12:31] limits of the stagecoach
[1:12:33] all the religions and different
[1:12:35] religions raised up and
[1:12:37] had told their part of religion and how
[1:12:39] great it was the muhammadans and
[1:12:41] the priests who told the great how great
[1:12:43] their religion was
[1:12:45] the buddha had told how great his
[1:12:47] religion was
[1:12:51] and that certain little minister was
[1:12:54] representing the religions of america
[1:12:56] the christian religion
[1:12:57] and when he got his time in the platform
[1:12:59] he told the story of a great
[1:13:01] foul woman low down till they didn't
[1:13:04] want to get around her
[1:13:05] to even get close to her to tar and
[1:13:07] feather she was immoral
[1:13:09] she was degraded thank you she was
[1:13:12] degraded
[1:13:15] heard me
[1:13:20] she was degraded
[1:13:24] your religions produced there was
[1:13:27] nothing that could help her
[1:13:29] and then said gentlemen of the religions
[1:13:32] of the world
[1:13:33] can your religion produce anything that
[1:13:36] could cleanse the hands of this vile
[1:13:38] woman
[1:13:40] everybody felt still right on the end of
[1:13:43] their seats
[1:13:44] no one said nothing
[1:13:47] then he jumped in the air and screamed
[1:13:50] and kicked these hills together
[1:13:52] and he said the blood of jesus christ
[1:13:54] won't only cleanse her hands
[1:13:57] but it'll cleanse her heart and make her
[1:14:00] pure as a lily
[1:14:03] the blood of jesus christ takes your
[1:14:05] sins away
[1:14:06] and cleanses you from all iniquity
[1:14:10] and makes us a new creature in christ
[1:14:13] jesus
[1:14:14] nothing else will do it
[1:14:16] [Applause]
[1:14:25] creeds won't do it do it nothing else
[1:14:28] will do it
[1:14:29] but the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:38] i may have just broke a lot of rules but
[1:14:44] i'm not worried about your rules
[1:14:49] i got a message to preach and satan's
[1:14:51] trying to stop me
[1:15:05] i read i run across something this week
[1:15:07] and i don't know where i got it from but
[1:15:11] it's worth reading to you
[1:15:15] do you seriously think god can't use you
[1:15:22] do you seriously think god can't use you
[1:15:27] noah was a drunk
[1:15:31] abraham was too old
[1:15:34] jacob was a liar isaac was a daydreamer
[1:15:40] leo was ugly
[1:15:49] you think that you've got complexes
[1:15:53] and god writes it down in the bible that
[1:15:56] you're
[1:15:56] tenderized
[1:16:02] but god used leah
[1:16:10] to bring forth his seed
[1:16:16] joseph was abused
[1:16:19] moses had a stuttering problem

[1:17:36] named simon and i won't be but just a
[1:17:38] few more moments
[1:17:40] for reasons and the lord said simon
[1:17:43] simon
[1:17:45] now listen we all know where simon came
[1:17:47] from
[1:17:51] most of us would have not welcomed him
[1:17:52] to our church
[1:17:55] but there's places there's places that
[1:17:59] simon is
[1:18:00] on a boat naked cossack
[1:18:08] he's rough he's not danny he hasn't been
[1:18:12] schooled and yet he's the lead disciple
[1:18:21] sometimes they're so we are so ashamed
[1:18:24] of our past we can't get over it
[1:18:26] but what if simon would have a complex
[1:18:31] help me preach what if he'd had a
[1:18:34] complex that i can't get over my
[1:18:36] years of my past listen it's over get

[1:19:07] and your heart's going
[1:19:10] and you're still driving down the road

[1:19:52] sarah endured 90 years
[1:19:57] of the frustrating humility
[1:20:02] humiliation of being barren
[1:20:09] but there came a time that she didn't
[1:20:11] have to live with that no more
[1:20:21] she was known as the mother of isaac
