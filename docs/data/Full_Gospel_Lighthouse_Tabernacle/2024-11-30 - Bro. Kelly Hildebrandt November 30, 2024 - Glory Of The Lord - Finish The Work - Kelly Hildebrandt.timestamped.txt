[54:07] you have your Bibles tonight let's just
[54:09] turn to the word of the Lord and I don't
[54:12] know uh if we'll stand if we can
[54:17] stand I'm going to put my timer on here
[54:20] make sure I don't go too much over time
[54:22] but you pray we'll preach You Pull and
[54:27] we'll preach I'd like to turn to Exodus
[54:30] 40:
[54:32] 33 to
[54:37] 35 incredible scripture that we're going
[54:39] to read
[54:41] here one that no doubt has been read
[54:43] many times over this
[54:45] Podium we' like to take a context out of
[54:48] it
[54:50] tonight Moses has just finished building
[54:54] the Tabernacle of tents
[54:56] it says and he reared up the court round
[54:58] about the Tabernacle and the Altar and
[55:01] set up the hanging of the Gate of the
[55:03] Court gate so Moses finished the work
[55:08] let's say finish the work finish the
[55:10] work say it one more time finished the
[55:13] work then a cloud covered the tent of
[55:16] the congregation and the glory of the
[55:18] Lord filled the Tabernacle and Moses was
[55:21] not able to enter into the tent of the
[55:24] congregation because the cloud Abode
[55:27] thereon and the glory of the Lord filled
[55:31] the Tabernacle God bless you you may
[55:33] have your seats tonight I'd like to
[55:36] speak tonight for a few moments of time
[55:38] on the glory of the Lord and if I could
[55:40] i' like to subtitle it finished the work
[55:43] finished the work it must have been an
[55:46] incredible day when Moses after having
[55:49] collected all of the articles for the
[55:51] temple and the historians have different
[55:54] different timelines and different days
[55:56] but they he was collecting for
[55:58] approximately for 8 months or more and
[56:01] then they had to do the actual
[56:03] construction I don't know about you but
[56:05] construction isn't always the always the
[56:07] pleasantest of things sometimes things
[56:10] go good sometimes things don't go well
[56:12] but it comes a time when everything is
[56:15] complete as we'd say the last nail has
[56:17] been put in it's been filled and and we
[56:20] would say that it's finished I don't
[56:23] know about you but when a construction
[56:25] project is finished I feel like going
[56:28] and
[56:29] celebrating because it's finished
[56:31] there's nothing like something being
[56:33] finished right in this case over here
[56:36] Moses is is doing this according to a
[56:39] blueprint it wasn't of his own design it
[56:42] wasn't of his own making but it was a
[56:44] blueprint that he had received from God
[56:47] and that blueprint was important because
[56:49] it was laying and opening up the door to
[56:52] the mind of God that would not just be
[56:53] for the times of Moses and their
[56:55] generation ation of time but would
[56:57] transcend all the way to where we are
[56:59] living
[57:00] today this was only a temporal
[57:02] habitation this was only a a place where
[57:05] God was going to come and meet the
[57:07] people but it was part of of his great
[57:09] architectural mind and it's so wonderful
[57:12] to see that Moses didn't put his own
[57:14] interpretation to it he didn't put his
[57:17] own ideas into it he he did it according
[57:21] to the way that God had had made had
[57:24] shown him on the mount right we can look
[57:26] at it today there's many different
[57:28] interpretations of things like that but
[57:30] God still has a proper Channel by which
[57:32] he works that's right and if we follow
[57:34] into the channel according to the word
[57:36] of the Lord then God is always going to
[57:38] allow his glory to come upon the people
[57:41] amen I think this when they were doing
[57:43] this here and Moses has finished the
[57:45] work and the work uh the word finished
[57:47] in in the dictionary means complete
[57:49] means perfect one of the parts that
[57:51] really caught my attention was that it
[57:53] says that it was polished to the highest
[57:56] degree of perfection in other words
[57:58] there was not one thing out of place
[58:01] every latchet every little piece that
[58:04] had to be in place was in its proper
[58:06] place and and it was not Moses saying it
[58:08] was finished but but the Bible declares
[58:10] and the work was finished I say I say
[58:14] Lord we're close to the Finishing Line
[58:16] ourselves in this generation I want to
[58:19] say that the work amen the work is being
[58:23] finished amen I I say if you don't know
[58:25] the Lord now it's a good day to get to
[58:27] know him amen amen this is the day of
[58:30] the Lord we know that God had taken
[58:32] Moses up into his presence and showed
[58:34] him the Heavenly pattern to build the
[58:36] Tabernacle the tents and he finished the
[58:38] work in Hebrews 8:5 it says who serve
[58:41] unto the example and Shadow of heavenly
[58:43] things as Moses was admonished of God
[58:46] when he is about to make the Tabernacle
[58:48] fore saith he that thou make all things
[58:51] let's say all things tonight all things
[58:54] let's say with some passion all things
[58:57] all things according to the pattern
[58:59] showed to thee in the mount amen so
[59:02] Moses was very very cautious in what he
[59:05] did and I make this a very strong point
[59:07] tonight because it's very important that
[59:09] we follow the word of the Lord amen
[59:12] sometimes the people wonder why do we
[59:13] praise the lord well we have a reason to
[59:15] praise the Lord amen sometimes people
[59:18] wonder why we get happy in church
[59:20] because we have a lot to be happy about
[59:22] we have a lot of things to praise God
[59:24] about thank the Lord for we look at our
[59:27] troubles but God doesn't look at our
[59:29] troubles I I read something I thought
[59:31] was incredible God will allow the worst
[59:34] things to happen to you to bring out the
[59:36] best in you many times we wonder why the
[59:38] Lord allows certain things he's just
[59:40] trying to polish the diamond he's trying
[59:42] to bring things to a certain place and
[59:44] when I look back in life I realize the
[59:47] hand of God that has been over my life
[59:50] over my my wife and myself over our our
[59:53] lives and you start to realize that the
[59:55] most difficult ult times became actually
[59:57] the most glorious victories that we ever
[59:59] had in life we sometimes wonder can we
[1:00:02] take another day and I say yes we can
[1:00:05] amen I would say it like this tonight is
[1:00:08] there's no quit in us what are we going
[1:00:11] to go to where are we going to go some
[1:00:12] people say this message doesn't have
[1:00:14] enough I say it has more than enough to
[1:00:16] take us from here all the way into the
[1:00:19] Rapture and all the way into the glories
[1:00:21] of the Lord this message is what we
[1:00:24] needed for the hour that we living in
[1:00:26] today and to discount it is to Discount
[1:00:29] what God is doing amongst his people
[1:00:31] today I say thank you Lord for this
[1:00:34] message thank you Lord for your grace
[1:00:37] thank you Lord for your mercy and thank
[1:00:39] you Lord for opening our eyes of
[1:00:41] understanding so that we can follow in
[1:00:44] the footsteps of our maker amen we know
[1:00:47] that that that that was a condescending
[1:00:50] God we know that it was God above us and
[1:00:53] God With Us and and now it's God in us
[1:00:56] amen and and God had to move everything
[1:00:59] a certain way what was he doing he was
[1:01:00] hiding his plan from the enemy amen
[1:01:03] because the enemy could never figure out
[1:01:05] what is God trying to do amen and we
[1:01:08] come all the way 6,000 years later we
[1:01:10] can look back on History we can say yeah
[1:01:12] the Lord was doing this here and the
[1:01:13] Lord did this here and now he's doing
[1:01:16] this today and I say don't miss your day
[1:01:18] of
[1:01:19] hesitation amen God is wanting to unveil
[1:01:23] himself openly to the people amen we no
[1:01:26] longer look into a into the book
[1:01:29] obscurely we look into the book with
[1:01:32] Revelation in this hour amen somebody
[1:01:35] say praise the Lord prise Lord amen God
[1:01:38] is wanting to get inside his people amen
[1:01:42] I'll say this on the onset of this
[1:01:44] meeting here tonight is they enjoyed the
[1:01:46] glory of the Lord because the Bible said
[1:01:48] when it was complete the glory of the
[1:01:50] Lord came down upon the upon the the
[1:01:53] tent and and it had an effect on the
[1:01:55] Ministry of that day but today the glory
[1:01:58] of the Lord can come on
[1:02:00] you amen today the glory of the Lord
[1:02:03] doesn't want to just give us anointing
[1:02:05] on the outside amen but the glory of the
[1:02:08] Lord wants to come to the inside of the
[1:02:10] inside amen he wants to share his glory
[1:02:14] with you he wants you to shine in all of
[1:02:16] his Illumination in this hour amen and
[1:02:19] we have a lot that we can be thankful
[1:02:22] for amen I also want to read Colossians
[1:02:25] 1: 26 just to put a bit of a platform
[1:02:28] down it says even the mystery which hath
[1:02:30] been hid if you could just give me just
[1:02:32] a shade more monitors make a squeal but
[1:02:35] just a shade more my voice is kind of
[1:02:37] giving me some issues today even the
[1:02:40] Mysteries which hath been hid from the
[1:02:42] ages from ages and from generation but
[1:02:45] now is made manifest to his Saints to
[1:02:47] whom God would make known what is the
[1:02:49] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:02:51] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:02:54] you amen let's say Christ in me Christ
[1:02:58] in you the hope of glory whom we preach
[1:03:00] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:03:02] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:03:05] man perfect in Christ Jesus that word
[1:03:09] perfect in Christ Jesus does not mean
[1:03:11] that you're not going to have the flesh
[1:03:13] problems that we deal with but what it
[1:03:15] means is that he's going to bring you
[1:03:17] into a place of
[1:03:18] maturity amen this message will bring
[1:03:21] you to a place of maturity I want to say
[1:03:24] it is bringing us to a place of maturity
[1:03:26] or it's bringing us to a place of full
[1:03:29] age Amen in other words we're no longer
[1:03:32] in childhood anymore we're no longer as
[1:03:34] a teenager anymore we're we are men and
[1:03:38] women who are ready for a Rapture amen
[1:03:42] my message over the years is never
[1:03:44] changes we're having a Rapture God has
[1:03:47] planned it he's going to have a people
[1:03:49] we believe we're part of those people
[1:03:52] amen and we need the glory of the Lord
[1:03:54] living within our heart
[1:03:56] amen not just a flesh anointing you see
[1:03:58] many times we can have a good meeting
[1:04:00] but then you talk to somebody Monday and
[1:04:02] it's like were they even in
[1:04:04] church where are they at you wonder
[1:04:07] sometimes in your heart we had special
[1:04:09] meetings and you have special meetings
[1:04:11] you have great ministry that's here but
[1:04:13] in Monday morning it seems like all hell
[1:04:15] breaks loose and you wonder where is God
[1:04:18] I want to tell you where he is he's
[1:04:20] inside of your heart amen Satan's only
[1:04:23] trying to see if it's real in your our
[1:04:26] heart amen we don't understand the the
[1:04:29] mind of God we want everything to be
[1:04:31] good we want to be patted on the
[1:04:33] shoulder all the time we want everything
[1:04:35] to go our way but that's not how God
[1:04:39] works God will allow Satan to turn your
[1:04:42] world upside down just to see what
[1:04:44] you're going to do about it amen but I
[1:04:46] want to say this with a declaration this
[1:04:48] morning amen we are more than Overcomers
[1:04:52] we are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:04:55] we're part of him and he's part of us
[1:04:58] amen he's living within our heart and
[1:05:01] we're shining forth in the glory of
[1:05:03] almighty
[1:05:05] God
[1:05:07] hallelujah we are his
[1:05:10] children not to be babied around where
[1:05:13] his children were rugged
[1:05:15] people amen coming to a place of
[1:05:20] perfection amen God is a god of
[1:05:23] order there's nothing that God does is
[1:05:26] out of order that's right when I
[1:05:28] consider and and I always love to talk
[1:05:30] about it that he tellthe stars and he
[1:05:33] calleth them all by their
[1:05:34] names amen he's acquainted with every
[1:05:37] one of them amen he just didn't just
[1:05:40] didn't put everything into disarray but
[1:05:43] he's the one that can take chaos and
[1:05:45] Chaos in our lives and turn it into a
[1:05:47] wonderful thing amen he can bring order
[1:05:51] into our lives amen one time when when
[1:05:54] you weren't serving the lord you watch
[1:05:55] your your life not out of control but
[1:05:57] you give your heart to the Lord it
[1:05:58] doesn't mean you won't be tempted but
[1:06:00] what it does do it gives you an order in
[1:06:03] life amen and God is a god of order
[1:06:06] that's why he showed Moses the the
[1:06:09] example that how he wanted the
[1:06:10] Tabernacle man built amen because he's a
[1:06:13] god of order can you imagine a God that
[1:06:16] would just have everything just in
[1:06:18] disarray all over the place that's not
[1:06:20] how our God works as brother brandham
[1:06:23] said the wheels of the Lord turn slowly
[1:06:25] but they turn true Amen in our lives
[1:06:28] they turn slow many times but they turn
[1:06:31] true amen as that one sister had to say
[1:06:34] I'm not what I used to be I'm certainly
[1:06:36] not what I want to be I'm not not what I
[1:06:38] used to be and we can see the working of
[1:06:41] the Holy Ghost in each one of our Lives
[1:06:43] amen do you love the Lord tonight amen
[1:06:46] amen that's why the scripture said the
[1:06:49] Earth was without form and void and
[1:06:51] darkness upon the face of the deep and
[1:06:53] the spirit of God moved upon the face of
[1:06:55] the of the waters God was going to move
[1:06:58] it into a place that would be a paradise
[1:07:01] for his children amen Satan's had 6,000
[1:07:04] years now and he's made a complete
[1:07:06] disaster of it amen you can change your
[1:07:09] political leader we can change our
[1:07:11] political leader I'll tell you what it's
[1:07:13] going to do it's only going to bring us
[1:07:14] that much closer to Rapture somebody's
[1:07:17] with me tonight amen we're looking for
[1:07:20] they're looking for a savior I've got
[1:07:22] the Savior what they need is Christ in
[1:07:25] their lives amen what they don't want is
[1:07:28] Christ but what we need is Christ in our
[1:07:30] lives and he's the only way into the
[1:07:32] Sheepfold it's through Jesus Christ Our
[1:07:37] Lord amen they want to bring order to it
[1:07:40] but God said that he'll bring order back
[1:07:43] into a position amen and we know that
[1:07:46] it's going to be order when he takes the
[1:07:47] Throne of his father David amen and
[1:07:50] things that are to be said now remember
[1:07:53] these are only temporal gifts and type
[1:07:55] now we know that Moses in building the
[1:07:57] Tabernacle in the wilderness or
[1:07:58] preparing it he said he made all things
[1:08:01] after the order of what he saw in heaven
[1:08:05] so the Earthly things only express what
[1:08:07] the Eternal things are and if this Earth
[1:08:10] that we live in today being so great we
[1:08:12] love
[1:08:15] it we we love it uh excuse me that we
[1:08:18] live in today being so great as we love
[1:08:20] it and love to live and breathe the air
[1:08:22] and see the flowers and things if that
[1:08:25] if this here is the expression one
[1:08:28] that's dying is only expressing one
[1:08:30] that's Eternal when you see a tree
[1:08:32] struggling pulling trying to live that
[1:08:34] means there's a tree somewhere that
[1:08:36] doesn't have to do that when you see a
[1:08:38] man here struggling to LIF somebody in a
[1:08:41] hospital or in a sick bed or in an
[1:08:43] accident struggling and death rattling
[1:08:45] in their throat pulling and crying
[1:08:47] screaming for Life what does that mean
[1:08:49] there's a place somewhere there's a body
[1:08:51] that doesn't struggle and scream for
[1:08:53] that see it just doesn't do it amen and
[1:08:56] we're struggling for that time we're
[1:08:58] looking to that time amen but I'm
[1:09:00] thankful to almighty God for the Holy
[1:09:02] Ghost in This Hour amen which is the
[1:09:05] earnest of our inheritance amen it gives
[1:09:08] us a a resting place in life amen sir I
[1:09:12] would see Jesus says may I go and Recon
[1:09:14] it now and say this that I believe that
[1:09:17] the right mental attitude toward any
[1:09:18] Divine promise of God will bring it to
[1:09:21] pass if you can take the right attitude
[1:09:23] toward that promise now if Moses would
[1:09:26] have decided I'm going to build this the
[1:09:29] way I wanted it to be built the glory of
[1:09:31] the Lord would never fill
[1:09:33] in amen if in your heart you're not
[1:09:35] prepared to empty everything out of your
[1:09:37] heart why would he come and fill your
[1:09:39] heart amen he want you to empty it out
[1:09:42] and allow Christ to come into your heart
[1:09:44] amen so the glory of God can be inside
[1:09:47] of your bosom amen you say brother Kelly
[1:09:50] why do you preach like this I think one
[1:09:52] of the greatest things that we need
[1:09:54] amongst ourselves is the Holy Ghost
[1:09:56] meetings and not just falling on the
[1:09:58] Flesh of a man but falling on the inside
[1:10:01] of a man amen completely changing that
[1:10:04] individual into a new creation in Christ
[1:10:08] Jesus
[1:10:10] Hallelujah that'll put a bounce on your
[1:10:12] heel on Monday and I'll put a bounce on
[1:10:14] your heel on Friday amen you come to the
[1:10:17] house of the Lord give me another charge
[1:10:19] oh god of your
[1:10:22] presence Hallelujah
[1:10:26] blessed be the name of the
[1:10:28] Lord but you have to take the right
[1:10:31] attitude toward the
[1:10:32] word if you take a wrong attitude toward
[1:10:35] it then it's not going to have any
[1:10:38] result as I ministered to the people
[1:10:40] back home on a couple Wednesday night a
[1:10:43] nights ago and and I and my Ministry was
[1:10:45] very simple talk topic do you have
[1:10:48] confidence in your
[1:10:52] prayer a lot of people pray as a hope so
[1:10:55] that's a lot of people pray as I don't
[1:10:57] know if it's going to happen we've got
[1:10:59] to change our attitude toward him amen
[1:11:02] we've got when we ask the Lord to do
[1:11:04] something we've got to have a confidence
[1:11:06] in our heart that he either keeps his
[1:11:08] word or he doesn't keep his word amen if
[1:11:11] we take the right attitude toward it
[1:11:12] he's going to keep his word you may say
[1:11:15] I don't see any results who's looking at
[1:11:17] results it's up to us to believe the
[1:11:19] word of God Amen we have some Believers
[1:11:22] here tonight amen do you believe the
[1:11:24] word of God you pray God will answer
[1:11:26] your prayer we got to believe the word
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:31] God we have to have confidence in
[1:11:34] him brother brandham talked about a man
[1:11:37] that was that was kind of had a little
[1:11:39] had a little problem with brother

[1:11:44] Christ and the man went home he was a
[1:11:46] contractor he went to sleep that night

[1:12:43] attitude all the time amen we think we
[1:12:45] can dilly dally around our God is a god
[1:12:47] of order amen there's nothing out of

[1:12:55] life amen in all of our Lives

[1:13:03] have too many quack
[1:13:07] Builders if you go back into Exodus 35
[1:13:10] you'll find out that God anointed man
[1:13:12] with specific
[1:13:14] gifts in order to to do the work that
[1:13:16] was laid out before him right they were
[1:13:19] going to work with all different types
[1:13:20] of natural
[1:13:22] articles in this hour God has anointed
[1:13:24] us special men in order to to be able to
[1:13:27] minister the gospel the fivefold
[1:13:29] ministry amen people think we don't need
[1:13:31] a five full ministry I I say it like
[1:13:33] this as God put it in the Bible you take
[1:13:36] it up with the boss that's right it's
[1:13:38] not up to me to argue with you CU I'm
[1:13:40] not going to argue with you you don't
[1:13:41] want a five full ministry that's up to
[1:13:43] you but I know I need a fivefold
[1:13:46] Ministry amen I need him to minister to
[1:13:48] my heart amen we need the washing of the
[1:13:51] Water by the word amen God has an
[1:13:54] ordained way in that's the way that he's
[1:13:55] going to minister to his people amen
[1:13:58] people say well I've got the prophet
[1:13:59] well we all have the prophet amen but
[1:14:02] we're supposed to do what the prophet
[1:14:03] said to do amen he said go to church
[1:14:06] that's what we do we're here tonight in
[1:14:08] church amen I traveled a lot of miles to
[1:14:11] be here with you all in church amen why
[1:14:13] we're here to to allow the glory of the
[1:14:15] Lord to come down amen you say can to
[1:14:18] come down in my car it's came down in my
[1:14:20] car many times can it come down in my
[1:14:23] house has come down in my house many
[1:14:24] times

[1:14:31] with the saints of God you start singing
[1:14:33] the songs of glory amen something starts
[1:14:36] to stir within your heart amen you hear
[1:14:38] the word come forward something starts
[1:14:41] to move within your
[1:14:42] soul amen what is it it's the glory of
[1:14:45] the Lord It's the
[1:14:50] atmosphere I say thank God for the
[1:14:52] fivefold
[1:14:53] ministry I I tip my hat to every one of
[1:14:57] them amen we need
[1:15:00] them remember years ago they told me
[1:15:02] there was no more Ministry I said well
[1:15:04] who took it
[1:15:08] out God put it
[1:15:11] in we're still
[1:15:14] here amen but I'm looking more at the
[1:15:18] coming of the Lord every
[1:15:22] day he finished the temple
[1:15:26] the Bible said the glory of the Lord
[1:15:27] came down upon it if we look at
[1:15:30] Solomon and the temple that he built
[1:15:34] took him seven years to build that
[1:15:36] Temple I look at it similar to the New
[1:15:39] Testament Church we've had seven Church
[1:15:41] ages some people want to put us into an
[1:15:43] eighth Church age but it's not in the
[1:15:45] scripture it's not just not
[1:15:47] biblical there's seven Church ages or
[1:15:49] seven prophetic
[1:15:52] Ministries we've had reformers and then
[1:15:54] we had a major
[1:15:56] prophet amen he came for a reason and
[1:15:58] for a purpose that wasn't himself but it
[1:16:00] was God he he would even declared
[1:16:02] himself you think I was talking about me
[1:16:04] he said no not me you think I was
[1:16:05] talking about the angel I'm not talking
[1:16:07] about him but we we're feeding on the
[1:16:09] body word of the son of
[1:16:11] man amen so God knows exactly what he's
[1:16:15] doing amen he doesn't need an extra
[1:16:18] Messenger to to help us that's right I
[1:16:21] heard one brother one time say that that
[1:16:22] this message only brings me to the open
[1:16:24] to The Awakening of the five wise and
[1:16:27] five foolish virgins we look for
[1:16:29] somebody to take us further in that and
[1:16:30] I said who is it is it
[1:16:34] you hope this
[1:16:37] okay I I'm I'm feel at
[1:16:41] home I said if this message is only to
[1:16:44] awaken us who's going to take us all the
[1:16:46] way
[1:16:47] through who's going to be the
[1:16:50] one and yet this m yet this uh uh
[1:16:55] Prophet that we've had brother brandham
[1:16:57] he gave us exactly what God wanted the
[1:16:59] church to
[1:17:01] have amen I'm not looking for another
[1:17:04] one to rise we already have it right
[1:17:09] amen and it's doing a good job as far as
[1:17:11] I'm concerned this message is our
[1:17:13] life it's our
[1:17:16] everything amen what are you looking for
[1:17:19] brother Kelly I'm looking for the dead
[1:17:20] in Christ to rise right I'm looking for
[1:17:23] a new body yes sir

[1:17:27] Finish Line that's what we're all
[1:17:30] waiting for is for the Finish Line
[1:17:32] that's where we want to go
[1:17:35] across amen I say the word has been
[1:17:38] fully
[1:17:40] restored I think the the Revelation and
[1:17:42] the Mysteries that had to be revealed
[1:17:44] according to Revelation 10:7 they've
[1:17:46] been
[1:17:47] revealed amen people want to argue about
[1:17:50] this and that say Hey just let's let's
[1:17:52] just read what's in the book what's in
[1:17:55] the scripture what's in the on the tapes
[1:17:58] amen we have everything we have need
[1:18:00] of we look into it and we can see by by
[1:18:03] the grace of God and by faith we can
[1:18:05] acknowledge and see our names in the
[1:18:07] Lamb's Book of
[1:18:09] Life amen and we're striving in in for
[1:18:12] that great hour of of our
[1:18:15] change amen I believe one day it's going
[1:18:18] to be a
[1:18:19] finished last one's going to come
[1:18:21] in amen I'm not looking at trying to
[1:18:24] save the world World we're only brother
[1:18:25] Bram says we're only sinning we're are
[1:18:27] saying we're only pulling in the ones
[1:18:30] that are there whoever they are it's not
[1:18:32] up to me to determine that amen but this
[1:18:35] message is not to save the world this
[1:18:37] message is for a
[1:18:38] bride her name is Mrs Jesus
[1:18:42] Christ and one day it's going to be over

[1:19:01] shine before your
[1:19:02] children amen they're watching God in
[1:19:04] your life and sometimes you would have
[1:19:06] to say I don't know if I'd want that God
[1:19:08] in my
[1:19:09] life on hope that don't don't hurt too

[1:19:58] brought us and it's keeping us thus
[1:20:05] far press forward it's just about
[1:20:10] done it's just about
[1:20:12] over amen don't give up now right amen
[1:20:17] there should be no give up in anybody's
[1:20:18] heart and in their life all the devil
[1:20:21] tries to comes and tells you the about
[1:20:22] church just kick them
[1:20:28] Moses finished his
[1:20:29] work came a time when Solomon would
[1:20:32] finish his
[1:20:34] work in 2 Chronicles
[1:20:39] 51-14 I love the scripture and it came
[1:20:41] to pass when the priests were come out
[1:20:44] of the Holy Place 2 Chronicles 511 14
[1:20:50] for all the priests that were present
[1:20:51] were Sanctified and did not wait by
[1:20:53] course
[1:20:55] also the Levites which were the singers
[1:20:57] all of them of ASF and hemon and judian
[1:21:01] and their sons and their Brethren being
[1:21:03] array in white linen having symbols and
[1:21:05] Sal trees and harps stood at the East
[1:21:07] End of the altar with
[1:21:09] 120 priests sounding the with
[1:21:12] trumpets I did a study years ago on on
[1:21:15] David and and the orchestra that he had
[1:21:18] and they said he in certain times he
[1:21:20] would have have a thousand piece
[1:21:23] Orchestra and they would pay play by
[1:21:25] their course so one part would come out
[1:21:28] and another part would come in and
[1:21:29] they'd keep keep repetive uh keep
[1:21:32] playing for days on end I thought if
[1:21:35] they could do that that's absolutely
[1:21:38] incredible amen without the baptism of
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost what about us with the
[1:21:42] baptism of the Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost everyone sounding trumpets and it
[1:21:48] came to even to pass as trumpeters and
[1:21:50] singers were as one to make one a sound
[1:21:52] to be heard in praising and thanking the
[1:21:54] lord Lord when they lifted up their
[1:21:56] voice with the trumpets and symbols and
[1:21:58] instruments of music and praised the
[1:22:00] Lord saying for he is good for his mercy
[1:22:02] endureth forever that then the house was
[1:22:05] filled with a cloud even the house of
[1:22:07] the Lord so the priest could not stand
[1:22:09] to minister by reason of the cloud for
[1:22:11] the glory of the Lord had filled the
[1:22:12] house of God Amen when I was thinking of
[1:22:15] of that Moses's and and and brother Bram
[1:22:18] said that Solomon took the exact same
[1:22:21] blueprint as what was given to Moses and
[1:22:23] and he built the house according to that
[1:22:26] blueprint amen had to have us outer
[1:22:28] Court inner court and the holiest of
[1:22:30] holy amen and in the holiest of holies
[1:22:32] it had to have the have the the Mana
[1:22:35] which was inside of it amen and we know
[1:22:38] that we don't live by bread alone but we
[1:22:40] live by every word that proceedeth out
[1:22:42] of the mouth of God Amen every word of
[1:22:45] it amen it's fresh every day amen you
[1:22:49] can read something yesterday and read it
[1:22:50] the next day and it's fresh all over
[1:22:52] again amen and they built this temp
[1:22:55] temple and it must have been a beautiful
[1:22:57] Temple all the gold overlaid on it
[1:23:00] everything was there and they were
[1:23:01] having a dedicational service that to in
[1:23:04] the presence of the Lord and the Bible
[1:23:06] says that the house of the Lord was
[1:23:08] filled with the glory of the Lord amen I
[1:23:11] I think what a wonderful thing is that
[1:23:14] if they if you would have your life
[1:23:16] dedicated unto the Lord a temple a
[1:23:18] tabernacle fill with the Holy Ghost a
[1:23:20] life of service used for the glory of
[1:23:22] God Amen and they had everything in
[1:23:25] Array I would have loved to be there
[1:23:27] that day on the inauguration of it amen
[1:23:31] when every trumpet everything become one
[1:23:33] voice as one sound amen that the glory
[1:23:37] of the Lord filled the whole house to
[1:23:39] the place where they couldn't even even
[1:23:41] uh stand to minister for the glory of
[1:23:44] God what would happen here tonight in
[1:23:46] this Tabernacle in this church tonight
[1:23:49] with Tabernacles of the Holy Ghost Amen
[1:23:52] in such a a one Accord to to the word of
[1:23:55] God that the glory of God would fall
[1:23:57] down among the people amen until you'd
[1:24:00] lose consciousness of who you are or
[1:24:02] who's around you and all that would
[1:24:04] matter is you and almighty God Amen I'd
[1:24:08] say we'd have an oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:24:10] filled meeting one more time amen not
[1:24:13] wondering about tomorrow or the next
[1:24:15] week but worried about what's happening
[1:24:17] right now amen that God would take
[1:24:22] control Hallelujah I say Lord may it
[1:24:25] happen I look for every service that I'm
[1:24:27] in amen for the glory of God to fill the
[1:24:33] house we lose
[1:24:35] consciousness of where we are and what
[1:24:37] we're doing all that matters at that
[1:24:39] moment is you and God Amen sicknesses
[1:24:43] start to leave amen problems start to
[1:24:45] leave people's lives marriages are
[1:24:47] restored everything comes into a union
[1:24:50] again why because the glory of God would
[1:24:53] fill the house
[1:24:56] house must have been a grand
[1:25:00] time David wanting to build it but of
[1:25:03] course he wasn't allowed to but it
[1:25:05] didn't stop him from
[1:25:07] preparing he knew that his son would
[1:25:09] build it so he started Gathering all the
[1:25:12] necessary things that he needed to
[1:25:15] gather amen but Solomon had the
[1:25:17] privilege to
[1:25:18] building Solomon's blueprint was
[1:25:21] identical to the blueprint that Mo that
[1:25:23] Moses had
[1:25:24] had amen and he didn't build it the way
[1:25:27] he wanted to build it he built it the
[1:25:29] way God wanted to be built and if God
[1:25:32] wanted to build his church upon the the
[1:25:35] prophets and upon that that's God's Own
[1:25:37] Business it's up to us just to take it
[1:25:40] and say Lord I'm going to walk in what
[1:25:42] you want me to walk
[1:25:44] in Amen in the
[1:25:47] dedicational message in 62 because we
[1:25:50] must always stay line by line with the
[1:25:52] scripture brother Brown Say now if you
[1:25:54] notice Solomon never varied one bit from
[1:25:56] the pattern that Moses saw in Mount sini
[1:25:59] in heaven Moses when he returned from
[1:26:01] his vision pitched the tent made it just
[1:26:03] exactly like he saw in heaven and when
[1:26:06] Solomon built the temple he made it just
[1:26:08] exactly the way he seen the pattern the
[1:26:10] type amen Moses pitched the tent for a
[1:26:14] Perpetual type in other words something
[1:26:16] that would continue because it was
[1:26:18] moving from place to place but Solomon
[1:26:21] he made the Tabernacle just exactly in
[1:26:23] the fashion that Moses had seen in
[1:26:24] heaven it was all put together set in
[1:26:27] order just exactly and he says what a
[1:26:29] spiritual application we could apply
[1:26:31] here that we never are never to leave
[1:26:34] the scripture stay exactly with the
[1:26:37] pattern amen and one one brother said he
[1:26:40] was looking for all the quotes about
[1:26:41] going to church I said well Paul and
[1:26:44] they said we should be in church he said
[1:26:45] be gathered together that more as you
[1:26:47] see that day approaching amen that's the
[1:26:50] scripture amen if we're supposed to
[1:26:52] follow scripture then I say let's follow
[1:26:54] the
[1:26:55] scripture amen and brother Bram said
[1:26:58] that's the reason I believe that the way
[1:26:59] the first church was patterned that's
[1:27:02] the way the next one should be patterned
[1:27:04] that's the way everyone should be
[1:27:06] patterned just the way it was at the
[1:27:08] beginning amen so if there was a a book
[1:27:11] of Acts church I believe we're the
[1:27:13] continuation of the book of Acts amen if
[1:27:16] the Holy Ghost fell upon them the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost will fell upon will fall Upon Us
[1:27:21] amen if there was healings there's still
[1:27:24] healings today amen if they're speaking
[1:27:26] in tongues they're still speaking in
[1:27:28] tongues today if there's prophecies
[1:27:30] they're still prophesying today amen why
[1:27:33] we've got the same
[1:27:38] church
[1:27:40] hallelujah amen I feel like shouting
[1:27:42] right
[1:27:43] now my voice is just starting to give
[1:27:45] out on me but you pray for me amen
[1:27:49] church we we we should not discount
[1:27:52] ourselves amen we should let the Lord
[1:27:54] Lord move in any way he wants to
[1:27:56] move amen if he wants to sweep over say
[1:27:59] let him
[1:28:00] sweep amen if you want to get happy you
[1:28:03] just get happy it's not going to affect
[1:28:05] me at all amen it doesn't matter if if
[1:28:08] if God wants his way that's what we
[1:28:10] should be concerned about that God moves
[1:28:13] amongst the people amen you say well I
[1:28:16] want some deeper Revelation what's
[1:28:18] deeper than God moving on your
[1:28:20] heart come on
[1:28:22] church amen I'm preaching like I preach
[1:28:24] at home so forgive me for it but but I
[1:28:27] just I'm just so zealous for for my own
[1:28:30] people I say Lord we've got to move
[1:28:32] allow the Lord to move amongst us amen
[1:28:35] why do we want to hinder the lord well
[1:28:38] the music's too loud or the song leaders
[1:28:40] too loud or they sing too fast or they
[1:28:42] sing too slow or it's too hot or it's
[1:28:44] too cold church we got to lay a side all
[1:28:46] of our sides amen and get into
[1:28:51] worship Hallelujah everything has to be
[1:28:54] in its
[1:28:57] order you say I don't feel like it today
[1:28:59] then give a praise offering anyhow amen
[1:29:03] you say I'm just tired and wore out
[1:29:05] praise Him
[1:29:06] anyhow amen give him glory in the house
[1:29:11] tonight
[1:29:17] hallelujah praise Him
[1:29:20] anyhow praise him when it's sunny praise
[1:29:22] him when it's windy praise him when it's
[1:29:24] cloudy it don't make no difference Just
[1:29:27] Praise the
[1:29:29] Lord we need to praise Him amen the
[1:29:33] Bible says that he inhabits the Praises
[1:29:35] of his people it's no wonder the devil
[1:29:38] wants to bring that down I say bring it
[1:29:42] [Applause]
[1:29:45] up worship Him in spirit and in
[1:29:51] truth people say you're going to have a
[1:29:53] lot of Frolic brother brother Kelly I
[1:29:54] never seen the Holy Ghost get out of out
[1:29:56] of get out of order in
[1:30:01] anyway the building was a great building
[1:30:04] it was a great
[1:30:05] grander Solomon made overlaid with
[1:30:09] silver precious stones
[1:30:11] gold type of
[1:30:13] deity beautiful beautiful
[1:30:16] place the people had a great
[1:30:20] expectation they didn't know what was
[1:30:21] going to happen
[1:30:27] but everything came in its
[1:30:29] order just like
[1:30:31] tonight everyone prepared for
[1:30:35] service musicians start to
[1:30:38] play could immediately feel the Holy
[1:30:40] Spirit moving in the back
[1:30:43] room they started to
[1:30:46] worship you could start feeling the
[1:30:48] presence of the
[1:30:50] Lord
[1:30:51] amen Prayer Warriors No Doubt been
[1:30:54] praying at
[1:30:55] home an expectation I hope you came with
[1:30:58] an
[1:31:04] expectation and when everything got to a
[1:31:06] certain
[1:31:07] place something started to
[1:31:10] happen we know on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:12] it was out they had to come in one heart
[1:31:14] one mind one
[1:31:15] Accord took them 10 days to get
[1:31:18] there but they got
[1:31:22] there and they they were anointed they
[1:31:24] were filled with the Holy
[1:31:26] Ghost but you know back in the time of
[1:31:29] Solomon even the grander of the temple
[1:31:32] that they had everything wasn't in place
[1:31:35] until the Ark of the Covenant actually
[1:31:38] came into its
[1:31:39] sockets when the Ark of the Covenant
[1:31:41] dropped
[1:31:43] in the veil closed behind
[1:31:46] it they started to get ready for that
[1:31:49] inauguration
[1:31:51] ceremony Solomon did exact ly as as he
[1:31:55] was shown by the
[1:31:56] blueprint everything was in its order
[1:31:59] and I love how the Bible is so detailed
[1:32:03] on exactly what
[1:32:05] transpired everything running down into
[1:32:07] its course even 120
[1:32:11] trumpeters everything running down to
[1:32:13] its course and it says when they become
[1:32:15] to make one
[1:32:17] noise then the glory of the Lord
[1:32:20] fell and it filled all of the temple
[1:32:22] with the glory of God
[1:32:25] Amen to the place where they they
[1:32:29] ultimately couldn't even administer to
[1:32:31] what they wanted to
[1:32:33] administer I thought if if that could
[1:32:35] happen with a natural Temple how much
[1:32:38] more for these temples that are made
[1:32:40] without
[1:32:40] hands for the end time Church the end
[1:32:44] time bride of Jesus Christ coming to its
[1:32:47] final spot final
[1:32:49] place what would the Lord want for his
[1:32:52] people then I read about brother
[1:32:54] brandham how when brother Brandon would
[1:32:56] Minister sometimes he said I found
[1:32:58] myself sitting on the
[1:32:59] pulpit he said I come to
[1:33:02] myself he said I got out of the pulpit
[1:33:04] he said the next thing the Holy Spirit
[1:33:06] struck me again and he said I started
[1:33:08] running down the preaching down the
[1:33:09] aisle rolling up my Pat leg and he say I
[1:33:12] come to myself
[1:33:14] again and he said really what am I doing
[1:33:16] rolling my Pat leg I thought if that
[1:33:18] could happen there I believe that that
[1:33:20] we can have that atmosphere and that
[1:33:22] Spirit amongst us
[1:33:24] amen it shouldn't be something that's
[1:33:27] foreign it should be something that that
[1:33:29] that is a desire within our
[1:33:32] heart amen I just don't want to know the
[1:33:34] doctrine of him I want to know the
[1:33:38] power of him I want I want the spirit of
[1:33:41] him living through my life amen we've
[1:33:45] had a lot of Doctrine but what is the
[1:33:47] doctrine has just made people better
[1:33:49] arguers I look at it we we need to let
[1:33:51] that word permeate our heart heart
[1:33:54] permeate our soul Amen to the place when
[1:33:58] Lord whatever you want I'm here I'm your
[1:34:00] servant it's not that you try to work it
[1:34:03] up or work it down they never did that
[1:34:04] they just got in one mind one Accord
[1:34:08] amen become one voice and worshiping and
[1:34:10] praising the Lord and and the glory of
[1:34:13] the Lord fell in the temple amen if it
[1:34:16] did it for them in those days and a did
[1:34:19] it for them on the day of Pentecost I
[1:34:21] believe that same God is here tonight
[1:34:24] Amen to do the exact same thing amen if
[1:34:27] we can get ourselves in position for it
[1:34:30] Amen brother bradam in the in the
[1:34:31] message dedication I hope it's okay if I
[1:34:33] read a few quotes he said he said how
[1:34:36] beautiful 10 Hebrews 105 but a body has
[1:34:38] not prepared me showing that God was
[1:34:41] going to dwell in a body prepared me and
[1:34:43] when this body had made a sacrifice the
[1:34:45] correct lamb had been sacrificed and
[1:34:47] there was coming forth and God came to
[1:34:50] his own body which was his bride and
[1:34:52] there had been 20 temples that God had
[1:34:55] created was ready for dedication that
[1:34:58] got all their unbelief I say Lord get
[1:35:00] our unbelief out of the way that's
[1:35:02] hindering the people amen they got all
[1:35:06] their unbelief beat out of them and they
[1:35:08] gathered in the upper room and waited
[1:35:10] for 10 days for a dedication service and
[1:35:12] when completely surrendered God came
[1:35:14] down again in the shik glory and filled
[1:35:17] all the house where they were sitting
[1:35:19] what did God do it was like the ark
[1:35:21] dropping into its proper rockets for the
[1:35:24] message of that day God dropped back
[1:35:27] into his proper Channel not into
[1:35:29] denomination or into a building made
[1:35:31] with hands but Into the Heart of men I
[1:35:34] say may drop again he dropped in this
[1:35:36] place for the days which said Pro
[1:35:38] Prophet The Prophet Joel I shall come to
[1:35:40] pass on the last day I'll pour out my
[1:35:43] Shak upon All Flesh your sons and
[1:35:45] daughters and shall prophesy your old
[1:35:47] young men shall dream dreams old men
[1:35:49] shall see Visions God came to his
[1:35:51] resting place where he finds finds rest
[1:35:54] not in a building but in the heart of
[1:35:57] his people he finds rest when the word
[1:35:59] finds a resting place in the heart of
[1:36:01] the people then they are not tossed as
[1:36:04] my words about every wind of Doctrine
[1:36:05] they have a peace and a Stillness and a
[1:36:07] Harmony and unity with God Amen and the
[1:36:11] Bible said when they started to say for
[1:36:14] the Lord is good for his mercy endureth
[1:36:17] forever and they became one voice amen

[1:40:34] the Church of the Living God in this
[1:40:36] generation of time our God is mindful of
[1:40:40] his
[1:40:41] people his
[1:40:43] mercy endureth forever he never chose
[1:40:47] you because you were a good person he
[1:40:49] chose you because your name is in the
[1:40:51] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:54] his
[1:40:55] mercy endureth
[1:40:58] forever
[1:41:00] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:41:04] Lord
[1:41:06] hallelujah I got a quote I'll share with
[1:41:08] you at the at the end of the service
[1:41:10] brother Brown said that God never chose
[1:41:11] you because you were good people because
[1:41:14] we're good people he chose you because
[1:41:16] your name let's say my
[1:41:18] name your name was written in the L's
[1:41:21] book of life before the the foundation
[1:41:23] of the
[1:41:25] world
[1:41:26] Hallelujah we can say with a declaration
[1:41:29] for his mercy endureth
[1:41:33] forever when they became in one mind and
[1:41:35] one
[1:41:36] Accord the glory of the Lord came upon
[1:41:40] the
[1:41:41] people amen it was a beautiful Temple
[1:41:44] but until the glory of the Lord came
[1:41:45] onto it it was just a
[1:41:47] temple amen when we were not a
[1:41:50] people in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:41:53] into this world speaking lies but when
[1:41:54] the Lord came AP part of your life what
[1:41:58] shines out of your life is the glory of
[1:42:01] God
[1:42:03] hallelujah oh
[1:42:05] my I think it's
[1:42:07] wonderful the glory of the Lord filled
[1:42:10] all the
[1:42:12] house Acts 2 which we're very familiar
[1:42:14] with we know they got into one mind one
[1:42:17] Accord and the Holy Ghost came upon the
[1:42:20] people Amen to the place where they
[1:42:22] actually lost consciousness of who they
[1:42:25] were they went up into the upper room
[1:42:29] afraid they came out of the upper room
[1:42:32] with a great Assurance in their
[1:42:34] heart amen I would say one moment in the
[1:42:37] presence of the Lord will change you
[1:42:39] forever amen just one moment it doesn't
[1:42:43] take a long time it just takes a
[1:42:46] moment and if the first church was
[1:42:49] birthed that way I believe the church in
[1:42:51] this last hour is birthed the same way
[1:42:54] amen what does God want to do he wants
[1:42:56] to have
[1:42:57] Fellowship When sin stopped the stopped
[1:43:01] the pl well it moved the plan of God
[1:43:03] into position but when sin in the Garden
[1:43:04] of Eden became God above
[1:43:06] us amen he was he was feared to get into
[1:43:10] his
[1:43:11] presence but then we know that the
[1:43:13] scripture tells us that a god
[1:43:15] condescended came down to earth amen
[1:43:18] when he came to Earth it was God walking
[1:43:21] and talking with the people but that was
[1:43:24] not the the completion of his plan even
[1:43:27] though all the grander of the the
[1:43:28] temples were built if you go to
[1:43:30] Jerusalem today that Temple Solomon
[1:43:32] builts not there the one that Ezra
[1:43:33] rebuilt isn't there amen that's that
[1:43:36] wasn't what his glory was was was
[1:43:39] pointed to his glory was pointed to each
[1:43:40] and every one of us a habitation a place
[1:43:43] for the Holy Ghost to come and dwell in
[1:43:46] the lives and the hearts of his people
[1:43:49] amen
[1:43:51] hallelujah and God's provide a place of
[1:43:53] worship that's what's a matter with the
[1:43:55] church today we're full of theology
[1:43:56] without any Dynamics in it that's right
[1:43:58] in other words you've got to have the
[1:44:00] spark to the gasoline or the gasoline is
[1:44:03] no more it's not even as good as water
[1:44:05] as long as there hasn't gotten no spark
[1:44:06] to it so that's the way no matter how
[1:44:09] well we're
[1:44:10] taught how well we'll believe and how
[1:44:12] much of the Bible that we say is true we
[1:44:14] and believe and we believe it all true
[1:44:17] it's got to be the Dynamics it's got to
[1:44:18] be there the spark to set that word of
[1:44:21] fire and make it start rolling
[1:44:24] amen it's got to have it if it don't the
[1:44:26] church sits still the car sit still
[1:44:29] you'll sit still but no matter how much
[1:44:31] you say I sympathize I believe every
[1:44:33] word of that you got to have something
[1:44:35] to spark that off to make that 100
[1:44:37] octane go to fire rate and the Big
[1:44:39] Church of God go go to moving on it's
[1:44:42] God to take the Dynamics with the
[1:44:43] mechanics nothing wrong with the
[1:44:45] mechanics but lacking Dynamics he says
[1:44:48] and I think that's what's a matter with
[1:44:50] the church today we're lacking the
[1:44:52] dynamical power to to press this word
[1:44:53] and make it live for this day Martin
[1:44:56] Luther had mechanics dynamics of his day
[1:44:58] John Wesley had them of his day
[1:45:00] Pentecost had them with their day he
[1:45:02] says what about our day this is another
[1:45:04] time the church should be fully grown
[1:45:06] let's say fully grown now ready to go
[1:45:09] meet Christ with the
[1:45:11] manifestation of my with the
[1:45:14] manifestation of every blessing that he
[1:45:16] promised in the Bible operating that
[1:45:18] great body where he promised that he
[1:45:20] would meet the people and be worshiped
[1:45:22] in this great church of his amen what
[1:45:25] does he want he wants a church that's
[1:45:27] living a church that's
[1:45:30] alive amen a church that when when you
[1:45:32] pray we respect
[1:45:35] results amen right amen praise the
[1:45:38] Lord amen I believe that's what he's
[1:45:41] coming
[1:45:41] for I believe that with all my heart
[1:45:43] brother Brown in another place he said
[1:45:46] he said the church should be on fire for
[1:45:48] God she should be moving on in the
[1:45:50] spirit of God and I believe today if we
[1:45:53] ever need the spirit of God maybe I'm
[1:45:54] speaking out of to my own people that
[1:45:57] are listening online if there's anything
[1:45:59] we ever need is we need a church that is
[1:46:01] moving on in the fire of God Amen we
[1:46:05] need to be refilled and refilled and
[1:46:07] refilled amen and refilled with the Holy
[1:46:09] Ghost every time I go into service I
[1:46:11] come with my cup turned up I say Lord
[1:46:13] here I am today Lord refill me one more
[1:46:17] time with your presence amen may your
[1:46:19] word become so real to me it becomes
[1:46:21] just a natural part part of my being
[1:46:24] amen hallelujah a church on fire for God
[1:46:29] a church unconscious of who's sitting
[1:46:32] around them amen a church that's willing
[1:46:36] to allow the Holy Spirit to move I
[1:46:38] believe I'm speaking those kind of
[1:46:39] people here
[1:46:40] today amen a church that wants God to
[1:46:43] move in a dynamic way not just when the
[1:46:45] music is on but when the music isn't on
[1:46:50] Amen a church that's moving in the power
[1:46:52] of God
[1:46:53] the glory of the Lord filling every life
[1:46:55] full of the beauty of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:00] amen praise the
[1:47:02] Lord amen do you love the Lord with all
[1:47:04] your
[1:47:05] heart amen I'm going to call the
[1:47:08] musicians forward
[1:47:09] now if they would come forward I'd like
[1:47:12] to sing that song Psalms
[1:47:14] 34 if we could sing that
[1:47:19] today in the message communion 1957
[1:47:23] brother Brown says you're not saved
[1:47:24] because you a good
[1:47:26] person you're saved because Christ chose
[1:47:29] you no man seeks God God seeks man Jesus
[1:47:32] said no man can come to me except my
[1:47:34] father draws him first and if we could
[1:47:36] stop just for a few minutes and realize
[1:47:38] the great importance of that one thing
[1:47:40] that it was God who chose you not
[1:47:42] willing that you should perish but give
[1:47:44] to you the opportunity and call you and
[1:47:46] elected you to be his servants what
[1:47:49] could be more precious than that without
[1:47:52] having a choice it it would be a total
[1:47:54] impossibility for any man to seek God
[1:47:57] for he's by nature is a sinner and he
[1:47:59] has nothing within him to give a desire
[1:48:02] to serve God I thank God that he came by
[1:48:06] each and every one of our ways amen the
[1:48:09] glory of the Lord you pray for me for
[1:48:10] tomorrow morning my voice is giving me a
[1:48:13] little problems tonight but we're going
[1:48:15] to trust the Lord for it in the morning
[1:48:18] amen I say Lord here I
[1:48:21] am where your
[1:48:23] people what we want is just the moving
[1:48:26] of the Lord amen it doesn't take a long
[1:48:29] sermon it doesn't take a short sermon it
[1:48:31] just takes God to move one time that's
[1:48:34] let's just sing that song Psalms 34 if
[1:48:36] you feel like standing stand if you
[1:48:38] don't then just remain seated
