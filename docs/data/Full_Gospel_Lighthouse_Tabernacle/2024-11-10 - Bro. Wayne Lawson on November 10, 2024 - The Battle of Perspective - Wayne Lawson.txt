speak this morning would be a great blessing uh sometimes the Lord just visit you and put something in your heart and I'm a I'm an old enough preacher to know just give him right away amen just just let him take his way amen uh and we want to if we can the book of Corinthians the 2D chapter the 14th verse and I want to read here second uh 1 Corinthians 2:14 I'll also read Hebrews 5 and14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they have foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned in Hebrews chapter 5 and verse1 14 but strong meat belongeth to them that are are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil may God bless his word this morning as you may be seated uh I want to want to speak to you um uh on this subject um it's something that's just been strong on my heart I I really wasn't planning to go this direction this weekend but the Holy Spirit like I said just really spoke to me this morning and I want to uh I want to just open uh my heart to this amen uh I want to talk to you about the Battle of perspective about the Battle of perspective here from the scripture of course Paul is using the word discernment and of course we recognize that that is a speaking of perspective it's a if you take the English word perspective it's just a way of thinking or understanding something uh such as any particular issue like you when you view something that is the way you view it that is your perspective of it and and of course that's exactly where the real battles are happening today is the battle it's in perspective it's how people view things cuz you can take something and two people see the same thing but they see it differently and then one sees it his way and he says that's right and the other one sees it his way and that's right but now there is a a right way to look at everything and that's God's way amen I I was just studying a little bit on truth and and I I come across a couple terms and maybe I'll preach about them later I I was going to talk about them a bit this morning but uh but there's truth is is that there is actually two kinds of truth there's actually objective truth and and then there's subjective truth and those two kinds of truths meaning uh that if you uh hold up this Bible uh an objective truth is this is the Bible it's an object so you you look at it it's an object so whether you think it's a Bible or not doesn't change the object it still remains to be a Bible and that's an objective truth but then subjective truths what you see it as how you think about it and you can say well that's just a book or it's this or that but it wouldn't change what it is and so is it when you start looking at the at the things of the Lord amen people can look at them and they can try to think that because they say it is a certain thing makes it that but that's not it at all that the word of God is true amen and his ways are true and and it doesn't matter how someone views it it just remains to be true amen it's kind of kind of like one time somebody was saying about brother brandom they said well you're trying uh you're trying to act like uh you you you make brother brandom a prophet I said oh no I said no that's not it at all they thought they had won the argument with me cuz I I said no I'm not trying to make him be a prophet and they said oh okay well that's better I said I'm not trying to make him a prophet he is a prophet amen I'm just trying to determine and say what God did it it it I just have aligned my perspective with the Lord amen and he has an objective TR truth and that objective truth of course amen I I find that human beings sometimes uh they have a little bit of a they have a little bit of a trouble even so much more humans than animals Amen in having real discernment it's an odd thing because you know God gives animals discernment you know when you look at the animals of the field brother BR talks about how that the birds knew to get out of the walls of the of the rock walls and how that he said that just before an earthquake he said the fish will quit biting and the and the cows and move out in the middle of the field because they have a discernment they they know they can be able to perceive something the the fish have discernment now you how many how many uh bow Hunters we got in here this morning white tail deer hunters and amen you all know them big bucks has got some discernment cuz you know they didn't smell you and they didn't see you but something happened he just I've had it happen that big old bucks walking down that trail and he just turns and goes that way and you why did he do that amen but it was just something in his senses told him that danger is there and he didn't reason it out he didn't think it out he just turn left you know amen because animals are more apt to follow that their god-given deser it amen it's a perception that's exactly how that the Ducks get from the north to the South they just follow the Instinct that God give them they don't reason it out they just do what is normal what is natural that that discernment comes to them and it's a god-given instin in now now we have seen it in the scripture that even even in the Bible it was y'all remember that story of balam and his mule what a story amen what a story about a guy that riding a mule and he's trying to use his poor old mule he's wrote it to the store and he's rode this thing for a lot of things but this time he's doing it on a mission to curse God's people because Bayo decided he wanted to curse God's people and and and he got on his own mule and took off riding and and the Bible records three different times that the mule stopped and the last time of course then balum got off and he was going to kill the poor mule and the mule just started talking wouldn't that have been a morning amen he said hadn't I been your mule for years and and I've never done this before amen and all of a sudden bam turns around and looks and the angel of the Lord is standing there see that animal could see the angel of the Lord amen when sometimes men can't amen now just because you can't see something don't mean it ain't there amen I can show you that over and over over and over again just because one person don't see it don't mean that it ain't there it's just like when Paul was on the road to Damascus and The Light Came amen he was the one that seen the light and heard the voice amen so you got to you got to see that animals sometimes are aware of things that even humans aren't aware of but then God brought him in amen and showed balum what it was that the mule was seeing and and remember that balum finally said he said well Lord if I had knew that you was against what I was doing the Way You Are I would stop my going and the Lord said no you go on and do it he said but don't you say anything but what I have put in your mouth so bam went on down there now how many realize this balam was a hireling hired by Bao to curse God's children and if you know who Bic was he was the king of the Moab people who the moabs were uh one of I think it was the oldest daughter of lot had a son named Moab and that became the country of Moab and Bayo was the king of that country amen so so they were kin folk and and and they were they were boy don't you love kin folk and they were kin folk to Israel amen but they didn't want to see amen Israel go into that kind of Revival so what they thought they could do is they could get a preacher that didn't like Revival and didn't like Israel and we'll give him a little money and he'll say whatever we want him to say because they knew they couldn't defeat Israel without some help somehow so they hired Bao and they bam and they brought him out there and then bam went out there and remember he went to the fundamental Altar and he built altars and put seven altars and seven lambs and he was a fundamental preacher he fundamentally went to the right altar amen and the prophet of God said while he was at that altar he began to pray and then the scriptures tells us that they took him to a high place so he could see Israel and while he looked upon Israel he saw them amen and Bayo was pointing out all the problems that was going on in the camp amen and Bayo thought for sure if I show him these things he would surely be able to curse his people amen and balam comes back to him and he says listen he said amen I went up into the high place he said and God said he said to him how shall I curse whom God hath not cursed or how shall I defy whom the Lord hath not defied amen and the Lord said from the top of the Rocks I see them and from the hills I behold them and the people shall dwell alone and they shall not be reckoned among the nation s who can count the dust of Jacob or the number of the fourth part of Israel let me die the death of the righteous and let me last the end be like this now balum was trying to actually curse the children of Israel but he was doing it from the perspective of Bao because baleo saw the church one way and God saw it another way amen and you see this brother B said what it is when balum looked at the church he didn't see the smitten Rock bam didn't see the Tabernacle he seen the tents but he missed one good tent he missed that one in the middle he missed that tent that had that pillar of smoke over it and that was in the center he was the wheel in the middle of the wheel bam missed that one amen and we say brother man said what he tried to do was he tried to judge Israel from a moral standpoint and wouldn't you think you could judge people that way from a moral standpoint amen but you know what when you're dealing with the children of God you can't can't judge him like that amen because because the prophet of God said he see he failed to see the higher calling of God Amen by grace and by election and they were in that line with God's word and when we wanted to curse them God said don't you do it they mind you leave them alone don't you touch them amen I think it's powerful today that God Amen can bless a people amen and no matter what you do you can't curse those people that God blesses amen I thank God for that kind of blessing in the Book of Genesis the 14th chapter amen it's there where Abraham is the one that receives this blessing originally amen when Abraham is on his way after helping his brother the Bible said MDC came unto him and blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham amen of the most high God now you know that's the Greek the Hebrew which is the name of God Elon which means the most high God so he was blessed of the most high God so if you're blessed of the most high God who is it that can curse you when the God of all gods has blessed you amen I tell you what a blessing this morning to know amen that the blessing through Abraham's seed amen was a blessing that God put upon them and no matter how others view them God blessed them anyhow because you cannot curse what God has blessed look at this in the in the Book of Numbers the 22nd chapter 41st verse the Bible said then they took baalam into the high places of Baal they actually carried this man into the places of other gods and from the view of another God tried to get this people cursed now if you take this church this message church and you go to the high places of the God of this age amen they'll show you ways to curse the Church of the Living God but God never cursed it do you see this baale would curse them but God never cursed him amen I I think the power of this is when God begins to move upon balum and he comes back amen and they say well I'll tell you what if you can't curse him from there let's go over to this other place and they took them into the high places of the wat tires where man could see the whole encampment of Israel and they could see every problems amen but as they were in those places and they could look up out upon them balum had to come back and he' come back with a story to tell them God is not a man God is not a man I think it's powerful this morning to see that God is not a man amen that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent and as he shall not do it that he has spoken shall he not make it good in other words God is not a man that you're going to tell him something about me that changes his mind I thank God this morning to know that God is Not So fickle that he changes his mind every couple of days about the Church of God do you see God is not a man that he's that he's able to repent nor the son of man that he should lie he's not going to lie he's not going to say things about the church that's not true and he's not going to change his mind about what he said and sometimes maybe you can't even see from your human perspective the Reason God called you or the reason that God has done to you the way he has amen but God ain't changing his mind even when you don't agree with the word about yourself he still said it and he still believes it and God can't lie because he's a God that don't lie amen behold amen balam said I have received commandment to bless and he blessed and he said I cannot reverse it do you know there are certain things that are irreversible there are certain things that are irreversible and the blessing of God is irreversible I want you to know this morning there are certain things in your life Satan cannot take from you amen your health May deteriorate your your finances may change amen your mood swings may happen amen but you see God has blessed you in a way that is an irreversible blessing that God puts upon you in other words there are things commanded toward our lives that there is nothing can change what God has done in his word concerning our life I remember when it became real to me amen that what God done in eternity sat can't change in time I'm glad to know there's nothing in time can change what God did in eternity listen let me say this a man can say whatever they want to about me but God never changes his mind about me no matter what man thinks or man says that's why Paul said I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present or things to come not he or death or any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord now in numbers 23 and 23 he said there is no enchantment amen against Jacob and neither any divination against Israel according to this time see there is nothing you can't put any Hocus Pocus on this bride you can try to say I curse you you can't curse me amen I tell you this I I have been in the forign world and I know there is real black magic there are real witch doctors amen but let me tell you this there is a real God and he has made a real promise concerning the Church of the Living God I remember first trip I ever made to India amen I remember standing in a hotel on a Sunday morning and and the Darkness was on and I was in there and I was trying to get ready and it was dark everywhere and things little weird things kept happening all around me and Satan come along and said well you've been cursed cuz I I was preaching pretty strong against false idols and things and and I I knew I'd stirred up some stuff pretty good and and and say says to me well you've been cursed and this happened and this happened and this happened and this happened and that's what that's what the problem is amen and as soon as that started settling in my mind another voice spoke and he said I have blessed thee and Abraham's seed has been blessed and whoever blesses thee shall be blessed and whoever curses thee shall be cursed and in that moment I knew amen that there was no witchcraft there is no divination there is no enchantment there is no Hocus po there's no secret Council meetings there is no group of preachers there is no group of men that can curse what God has already blessed and I thank God to this morning that when God's blessing comes upon the church amen that Satan cannot reverse what God has already set upon the Church of the Living God and I ain't got to go back every week and ask I ain't got to go back every week and ask Lord is the blessing still on me listen to me gifts and callings are without repentance come on church amen if God called you as a son or a daughter of God you were called to be a son or daughter of God before you ever stepped in this church and if God can save you over your wicked nature and he could call you over your wickedness in your life how much greater can he keep you once you're a son and daughter of God born in the Holy Ghost I tell you what I don't sell out to fear I will not be afraid of the devil and his wickedness and all of the puke he can spit out in this age that we are true Sons and Daughters of God we have been called and anointed and elected the age amen and there ain't nothing the devil could do about it and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it somebody said ain't you afraid no I am not afraid I have heard the word in this age I am not afraid of that enemy hallelujah hallelujah God Amen has not beheld you from balam's camp or bic's Camp amen but he hath beheld you amen he has beheld you from his own Mountaintop the Prophet come back brother BR said it like this I have not conceived iniquity of Jacob I don't see him from the utmost Parts because I have beheld him from the mountain top I have not found iniquity in Jacob knows how he uses the two Jacob and Israel amen I have not seen the perverseness in Jacob nor the iniquity in Israel God wasn't looking it's the reason he wasn't seeing it come on that now that there's a powerful thing setting here God would have seen it had he looked but God wasn't looking at the people he was looking at the atonement you say well you know well you you need to see it from this direction well but I look as my perspective I must look at it it through the word because that's the way God sees it when he puts it in his word that's how God sees things is he puts it in his word now truly that bunch of Israelites I'll tell you what a prophet said he said he had done every dirty thing there was to do and truly that bunch of Israelites had done that and that's right and that where that preacher failed to see it he thought surely a holy and moral God would curse these people for the bad things they had done but they failed to see the brass Serpent and the smitten Rock going before them they failed to see the signs he said he looked at the moral side but God was not looking at that he was looking at the election now church that's that's that's that's a real Bible teaching that God was looking at the election and he said oh how Godly are thy tents oh Jacob now what is it it was a blessing that had come upon them do you know when God blesses you you're blessed and so somebody says well Heen I I don't know brother Wayne I've got some issues and I got situations listen I'm not talking about those kind of blessings I'm talking about the blessing of the way God sees you because this is the blessing that he had upon David in Psalms 32 when David said blessed is a man whose transgressions is Forgiven and whose sins are covered in Psalms 32 and2 he said blessed is a man whom the Lord imputeth not his iniquity and who in the spirit is there is no G now what does that word impute means it means simply amen that God don't count it now it's not that David didn't do it it's that God didn't count it amen do you see some that that come on y'all read David's story amen David did it but God didn't count it I I sometimes it's a it's a it's a hard thing for people to see this but but any of you that ever went to school and and the teacher had a class favorite you you know about that because you know you done ever little thing you done and there was a mark by your name you know but there was that one little fella that one little that one little kid amen that that that never had a mark by their name you know why they never had a mark it wasn't cuz they didn't do what I did it's just the teacher looked at them different he the teacher saw them different amen they were as mean as I was but the difference was amen the teacher saw them different so they never got no marks amen and you could get mad and say they ain't got no marks but they did this and this and this and think well I'm sorry I didn't see it can you imagine amen the devil trying to get God's children in trouble amen when all of these things that the devil sees amen but God don't have any marks there is no marks there is no iniquity imputed to the children of God Amen because that God said you are blessed glory be to God now it's one thing Amen to say that in the Old Testament but Paul comes along in Romans chapter 4 brother Braham said this is the scripture he reads when he got the blues in Romans chapter 4 he says Paul says this what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh ha found for If Abraham were justified by works he with were to Glory but not before God for what saith the scripture Abraham believed God it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justify the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness now even as David describe the blessedness of this man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin now I I I sometimes really enjoy looking at the writer of scripture and this is Paul now talking about David now David and Paul both had something in common they were both the Seed of Abraham they were both children of Abraham and and David had troubles in his life but he was recording that God never saw them and here Paul is now look at Paul's record if you start looking at Paul it's an amazing thing because Paul has all this problem in that he was killing Christians and he was persecuting which was for sure it was blaspheming for sure Paul was blaspheming God Amen he was blaspheming the very spirit of God Amen but you know what's powerful God never counted it and Paul is writing this amen about David but he is a recipient himself knowing that when God has blessed a man that that man is blessed and there is nothing that can change it and God never counted and that's what I I probably would have to say to you this morning is be careful how you judge somebody because you might be looking at them different than God's looking at them you might be seeing things differently than God sees them because God may see them from a different perspective and I want to see the perspective that God seen brother random says when Abraham's commentary was written the Divine commentary Paul wrote of him he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief never no not one thing was counted to him and and I'm a I'm a I read my Bible and you all know that when the angel spoke to Abraham the Bible said he staggered backwards and fell on the ground laughing at the angel at the idea of having a child in his old age the Bible records it in the Book of Genesis that he fell on the ground but when Paul records it in the Book of Romans he said he never even staggered now now either now either he did or he didn't yes he staggered yes he even fell on the ground naturally but when God wrote his story he never even staggered at the promises of God and I pray this morning that God writes my story I pray amen that it's not my accusers that write it I pray that it's not my enemies that write it I pray God writes my stories because God sees the intent of my heart he sees the mistakes that are made are made for the kingdom of God hallelujah somebody said well I never made no mistakes well you ain't never done nothing yet if you ever do something and you then you recognize amen that there are things to pick on Amen but there is no sin imputed can I just read a couple quotes here as we go along brother B said did you know a real Christian doesn't even have sin imputed at all to him because David said bless this is a man whom God will not impute sin when they're washed in the blood of the Lamb not by m belief but really by the blood of the Lamb God does not impute anything that's done because they're under the blood and he doesn't see it that's the blood sacrifice the only thing he can see you in is the way he saw you before the foundation of the world well I tell you what that are to get a running spell going amen the only way God can see me is the way he saw me before the foundation of the world that's not an almanac that's a Vindicated Prophet so when God's looking at you the only way he sees me is the way he saw me before the foundation of the world I tell you I thank God this morning that he ain't trying to figure out who I'm going to be he already knows who I am he's already given his word concerning my life and he cannot see me differently hallelujah hallelujah that's all that he can look at is because he's redeemed now now some people have trouble even praying because they got uh condemnations in their life they got trouble and they say well I I don't even to know if I have a right to pray brother Ram says when you're praying he said God don't see me he just hears my voice through the blood of Jesus he don't even see me he hears my voice amen listen this morning hey something something setting over your prayer life some old devil said well you did this or said that or this and and you don't have any right to talk to God anymore listen there's a blood amen and you're standing under it so look up through that blood and say father forgive me amen and the prophet of God said when you speak to the blood and you confess your sins the only thing that's heard on the other side is Holy Holy Holy the blood is a converter of confessed sins and it comes out as holy holy holy he doesn't see me he hears my voice and the blood is what represents me huh in Micah chapter 7 verse 19 the Bible said he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast their sins into the depths of the sea into the depths of the sea now he will subdue our iniquities when God takes away the guilt of the sin that it may not condemn us now ain't you thankful that he can take away the guilt of sin that the sin would not condemn us and he can take away the power of sin that it may not rule over us so not only does he do away with the guilt of it he does away with the power of it that it won't be able to rule over us he doesn't throw it over on the banks of the sea he throws it in the depths of the sea amen that way that it's not merely on the seashore for someone to walk by and find it's not merely just cast on the seashore that somebody could walk by and find it if the water goes down amen but rather it is cast into the depths of the sea that it may never be found again listen the Bible says in Jeremiah 50 he says that in those days sath the Lord the days the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of Judah they shall not be found for I will pardon them whom I reserve the Bible said that people will even look for the problems that people will even try to search out sin they'll search out trying to find something wrong with you but God said it won't be found amen because he has threw it in a place that it can never be retrieved again listen I don't know about you but sometimes the devil likes to remind me of my past but listen I want you to know amen God stay down Amen on the banks of the sea amen no fishing here there's no fishing in the in the history because God has already put it under the blood now church amen watch it go forward amen but if the devil wants to talk about our past well let's talk about his future if wants to talk about our past let's talk about his future I'm a Bible reader The Book of Revelations tell me there's coming a time that we're going to take that cancer devil and we're going to throw him in the Lake of Fire we're going to take that anxiety devil and throw it in the Lake of Fire we're going to throw the demons in the very fire that they'll utterly be destroyed come on church if you can remember the past let's remember the Future Let's Start remembering our future and start remembering there's a heaven we're going to there's a mansion amen that God already has prepared if you're living in a little cabin this morning amen just remember you got a mansion waiting if your old body is failing remember you have a theophany just over the threshold it's an 18y old body my it must be influencing me right now cuz I feel about 18 Again hallelujah hallelujah just remember the future remember the devil won't be there in the future the devil lost his power in the future oh there coming a fire there's coming a future Katie and I guarantee you this all them Devils will be dead in that Lake of Fire and all that pressure will be over and all oh God Amen and all that pressure will end and the power of God is a reality and the past is done and the future begins but listen we don't have a future without our loved ones come on the devil's been trying to sell it he's been had a wholesale going on that you're going to lose your children and you're not going to get them but I'm a Bible reader in Isaiah the 65th chapter it said that I will be there with my offsprings and a prophet of God said I give that as a token to your mothers so I got something to tell the devil just remember I'm going to spend eternity with my children and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it there ain't nothing the devil can do I remember what God Said concerning my life I remember what he said about his children Hallelujah brother I'm going to be there that morning and we going to kick that devil right back in the hell that he called out of and there won't be no more cancer and there won't be no more diabetes and there won't be no more struggles and mind battles and there won't be no more old age come on oh it'll be peace forever more on that blessed Shore where we stand together with our Lord Jesus amen and look out across the rims and The Eternity and the only thing we'll talk about is how that we whip that devil on November the 10th 2024 in Full Gospel Lighthouse and we're going to sit there and talk about how the Holy Spirit came in the room and while we were in the middle amen of a trial in our life and God showed up and said you're looking at it wrong you're looking at it like a human but I made you a child of God you're looking at it like that you could be lost in God and lost and God but God is going to save every child that he has got and there ain't nothing going to stop [Applause] it there's not enough devils in hell to stop what God is going to do in this generation you say I see a lot of trouble I see a lot of Glory you say I see a lot of problems I see a lot of positive I see a lot of God I see a lot of the power of God I see a lot of promises I see the Horizon you may see a troubled people I see a rapturing people you may see a bunch of nuts but I see God's finest and purest I'm looking through the window of Prophecy perspective is everything and Satan takes you in places to try to get you to perceive one another the way he perceives them it's a battle for perception no wonder he would say who is like the god that would pardon iniquity I've always loved that who is a god like unto thee that pardon iniquity he could have said anything when he finished that statement who is like a god that made the heavens the Earth the sea he could have said who is a God that made the the stars made the human he could have said any of that but he didn't he said who is a God Like It unto thee that paronthi because that it takes God it takes God to do it now here's the thing what you see and what you do brother Bram said see it's not all together determined by what you see and what you hear he said it's determined on the discernment we have have of what we see and what we hear your destination is your discernment of what you see and hear now if you're a amen as a as a as a as a Believer John chapter 3 the scripture tells us the story of Nicodemus and Jesus he's a great leader among the Israelite people and he comes to Jesus by night and says it Master we know you're a teacher from God what should I do and Jesus told you're going to have to be born again it was a mystery it's a Marvel to him how should I enter my mother's womb again should how is this to be but it was then that Jesus explained by the water the blood and the spirit and he says look unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now what Jesus was telling him that unless you're unless you're born again you can't see things the way a Christian sees them you can't understand the way a Christian understands see and and and and may I say this brother BR said sometimes people don't have the right discernment and the church gets the name of the devil tacked on it because of the wrong discernment people are afraid of it they publicly denounced our Lord as an insane person they hung him on a cross in capital punishment under their civil law in their religion they deemed him as an insane and crazy man they beheaded Apostle Paul they cut they cut Isaiah aunder because of their perception of him think about this this morning the unconverted man has no ability to judge the house of God the unconverted has no ability to judge your worship he don't have ability to judge your direction he don't have ability to judge your life because he's unconverted man he cannot not see it the way God sees it because he cannot see the kingdom of God that's why people look at the way I worship and dance and praise God and they think I'm a heretic well listen you think anything you want to about me but I'm the one that knows God saved me I'm the one that knows where I would be if it wasn't for God and this word people say well brother Wayne you preach the message too strong well amen you don't know what I be without this message and the greatest Testament that I have it's real is it's not brother Ron's life it's not brother Ram's life it's not brother Ericson or or one of you people but my own life testifies to me that this message is a reality and God gave it to me and I can see it from God's perception of what he gave in this age and now listen you sometimes people say well you people get carried away and you you act like you're drunk and everything else well let me let me just let me just put it out there amen the the Bible said Jesus was the lily of the valley and brother B said what come out of that Lily amen that was important was the Opium he said and that's the thing people go down these opium houses he said and they get high on opium and they try to get the cares of their lives and they try to get their wores and they do it over in a drug housee somewhere but the Church of the Living God don't have to go to some drug house we don't have to go down to the crack house amen we don't have to go buy a bag of weed or or a fifth of whiskey amen because there's a lily in the valley so in the middle of our Valley don't you ever judge me till you've been in a valley amen until you have been in the depths of a dark Valley don't you ever judge me because of the Opium that I must take to maintain my life unless I have the Opium I'll never make it unless I have the Opium I would lose my mind but God gave us an opium and we don't have to go crazy we don't have to go into this insane world because God has G us something that we might have but I tell you there's some side effects to open OPI has some side effects to Opium it makes you not care what other people think about you you want to get free in the spirit get a little opium and it'll take the pride off of your life it'll take the humility and raise it to the place that you can love God whether you're in church or a supermarket or in a family vacation amen because you get high on the Lord look buddy amen I know people said well brother Wayne you shouldn't dance in the spirit well you do whatever do whatever suits you but I remember going to a Don Williams concert when I was 19 and dancing to Louisiana Saturday night well if I can dance to Louisiana Saturday night and a Don Williams concert surely to God I can dance to The Old Rugged Cross of the meeting in the air or oldfashioned religion amen why because church amen I never quit Dancing I changed my partners I took the Holy Ghost and the power of God you got to see it from the perspective I see it when I'm dancing it's not emotion when I'm dancing it's not to build somebody up when I'm dancing because I'm free I'm dancing cuz the Holy Ghost came in my life and I can move my feet and I can move my hands and I can move my mouth because God gave me life God blessed me and the devil can't change it so I say devil go on back to hell you came out of the Sons and Daughters of God are going to enjoy the Salvation well it's that old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it but it's good enough for me give me that old time Holy Ghost give me that shout dancing tongue talking Bible believing Holy Ghost feel living you can have your dry religion I don't want nothing to do with it I want an atmosphere where children can be born people can get saved so well by the way I think this about it and I think that about it well some unconverted people have no ability to discern that's that's can I say Hollywood has no right to discern the dressing of our sisters that's them women ain't got the moral of a pig come on brother B said they're worse than a female dog and they want my daughter to dress like that they want your daughter to dress like that and act like that and that's acceptable it's unacceptable but unconverted men looking at them wants them to go that direction well we might as well preach we're here that's why some preachers can't preach against makeup you know what brother Bram said he said if your pastor Don't Preach against makeup vote him out and get you a man of God cuz you can put makeup on and meet a man he said but you don't put makeup on to meet God and he said if I know anything about it you better wash your face sister before you meet God there's one woman in the Bible that wore it and that was Jezebel you know why she painted up she painted up to hide her evil heart talking about judging now judging judging you know that you know that uh uh that that lot had more than one son and one of his other son one of his other sons was Ammon amen one of them is BIC the other one's Nash and he was the king of Ammon Ammon was a was a was a brother to Moab and they had a king do you know when the when the when the when the Bible was transitioning from prophets to Kings that when the time of Saul when Samuel was being turned down they they went ahead and got him a king and in that hour there were some of the people didn't receive the king and so this so This Nash king of Ammon moab's brother country went to him and said I'll tell you what we'll do we'll make a deal Let's Make a Deal we're going to put out the right eye of every man you got in here and we'll we'll be able to make a deal well I'll tell you this the only way a Believer ever makes a deal with the Devil is to lose your right eye because your right eye is a type of your spiritual sight and when you lose the spiritual sight you lose true perception of what God is doing do you see what it is the Satan will want to poke out your eye but the reason he wants to poke out your eye is because he wants to make it a carnal Warfare he wants you to look in the mirror at yourself self because that's where you lose your power when you start examining looking at your own flesh and you start thinking about you and all you can do and all you can say that's where you lose your power but when you start looking at the cross that's where you gain your power when you look at yourself you go down when you look at Christ you go up look at it because God does not want us to lose our spiritual sight because that's how we're going to fight the battle that we're fighting of course in the Old Testament you know They Carried their shield and they covered up their left eye with that shield and their right eye was their fighting eye and they'd hold a sword and that right eye was the only eye sticks out behind the shield and that was their fighting eye that's the way they could defend their land and and they could have a and you see the moment Satan puts out your spiritual eye amen that's when you start making deals with the devil that's when things start cripping in your home that's when situations start rising up because you're losing the sight that this is a spiritual battle am now I could get pretty heavy in that but you you got to you got to be careful because that's when Satan goes telling you things about one another and when you don't got no spiritual sight that's all you do is believe it see because it's the very thing that was being done here is we we'll say this about this person will say this about this person will say about this and after a little while you've lost all your confidence in God you lose all your confidence in yourself because Satan has put you in the seat of scornful and in the place of criticism and and you're going to die in that place and he knows it he knows now now I I could preach a while here but I I'll just say it brother M said it very clearly don't you ever get bitter don't you ever get bitter because bitterness will eat all the Christ out of your life it'll eat it all out Church it'll make you a carnal man oh you may still go to heaven you may still be a Christian but you're going to me a miserable sort you're going to live an UND defeated life you won't have any Victory you won't have because you're not looking at the right things amen I'll tell you this the people in this church that sees the most problems in the church I guarantee you are the worst off in the church come on the people that sees the most problems has got the most problems I I'm a pastor the people that see the most problems have got the most problems because they're viewing it from a carnal place and if you look at the church in carnality sure b b b come out over and help you out amen but if you're going to look at it from the high place if you're going to climb up in the presence of God you would see it through the blood and if you're looking through the blood you would see it the way God sees it and your perception of everything would change when you get a vision of the power of God I tell you I thank God today that there's a vision that we can have of the power of God you know when Joshua crossed the river Jordan and went into his first great battle at the walls of Jericho now that's a battle like our battle and it was a great stronghold and he didn't know how he would ever get by it there's strongholds in your lives this morning and you're sitting here thinking how will I ever get this stronghold out of my life well I tell you what happened in the Bible God came down in the form of a man and spoke to Joshua and Joshua didn't even know who he was talking to until he said to him I'm the captain of the Lord's host I'm here to command this battle and when Joshua saw who it was he humbled himself he went into reverence but that wasn't all he did he didn't only say well I believe the message is right and I believe that's the truth he didn't only do that but he went into action with the command that was given to his life he was so sure it was God commanding him that he went into action and literally believed that he could walk the wall of Jericho down without a sledgehammer without throwing one rock against those walls he believed that if he operated Under The Obedience of the message that the supernatural God would show up on his behalf now church when you change your perception you change your expectations now now you you you you you got to get this everybody if you do something wrong there ain't a person sitting in here that don't look for something bad to follow it right that's right I can show you in the Bible where you got the thought because remember when David numbered the children of Israel there was a lot of people died and then whenever that the B of peor the Feast of B peor there was a lot of people died amen but because it was Disobedience people died is that right it was Supernatural plagues that Came Upon them it was troubles That Came Upon them but if we can believe that obedience opens the door that that Disobedience opens the door of Supernatural then why don't we believe that obedience opens the door of Supernatural then if you haven't been baptized and you're trying to figure out how to be a Christian just take a few steps amen don't just say I believ God and I believe the Bible amen take some action get up and get baptized obey the scriptures in Christian baptism if you've never had the Holy Ghost quit saying well I believe there's a Holy Ghost and go to receiving the Holy Ghost somebody said well I'm praying for it quit praying for it and take it amen quit begging God for something he's already give you and say Lord I receive the Holy Ghost because God ain't going to make you beg for it he's already paid the price for it you ain't got to come up with some money you ain't got to come up and pay some kind of price for it you got to receive what God has already given you do you see what it is amen it makes it it makes a huge difference on what you're looking at if you're looking at them walls well you probably won't get them to come down but if you see that it was the angel of the Covenant that was talking to Joshua that that talked to Joshua and he said those little words see I have given you this land that word see God commanded him to have a vision that it was his that it was his land it wasn't the janitor giving it to him it wasn't just a prophet giv it to him but it was God gave it to him he said see I have given you this land now go take it and if you see that Joy belongs to you then whatever devil whatever stronghold whatever problem is between you and it you know right now it's time to take action and go get what belongs to you if you're sitting here this morning and there amen and you're got a sick body healing belongs to you it happens in the spirit first folks it don't happen in the flesh it happens in the spirit and I pray this morning that every stronghold of unbelief would be broken that the power of God would bring healing in this building to every sick body to every person that's defeated to every depression to every every person bound under sin I pray the stronghold of the enemy would come down around your life that you might be able to receive God in a way that you have never knew him do you see a lot of people try to say well I'll tell you what there ain't no real devil well there is there is is a real devil and brother Bram said he was real he said there is a real devil and he said don't tell me that I meet him every day and I know a devil and you must be trained if you're going to meet him not trained in Psychology or education but trained by the holy spirit because God's power in his word is there to make it manifest the devil's just a Tormentor right that's all he is he's that to torment you anybody ever get something on their mind and it just won't leave you alone do you know 85% of what you worry about never comes to pass come on Church 85% what you we about never comes to pass you'll lay awake and wonder what's going to happen with this and how's this going to be and what's this going to be and it never even happens but it's Satan trying to torment you he's trying to take you in a place of Torment by giving you a perception of failure by giving you a perception of troubles and this is an oh I tell you Satan really likes to throw them out there because they're unconquerable Tre uh troubles when they're in your mind that's right right cuz he'll give it to you in a way there's no there's no there's no hope in fixing it see right the kind of trouble he gives you in your mind he can build all kinds of blockades and and this is going to happen and this that and this this GNA be this way and this going to happen after a little while you're just tore all the pieces but it's just the devil because he's a Tormentor every time Satan talks to you he takes you down have you ever noticed that when Satan starts talking to you you go downward isn't that wild have you ever noticed that your spirit gets lower and lower and lower you know why because his influence is a fallen angel right he's a fallen a fallen angel so since he's going down he's always influencing people to go with him amen look his influence on the serpent what happened to the serpent the serpent went from an upright creature to on its belly because of the influence of the devil what happened to all them angels that followed Satan they were cast down and they lost their position and fell downward because Satan is the king of the bottomless pit in the Book of Revelations the n9th chapter it'll tell you how that Satan come up from the bottomless pit and fills the Earth with smoke and trouble is everywhere and trials are everywhere amen but don't quit reading in Revelations 9 because if you read Revelations 10 and verse one the Bible said there's another Mighty Angel comes down from heaven and this one that comes down has come down to take you up this message didn't come to drive you you in the ground it come to bring you into the power of God that's the reason I don't believe our preachers should get up and beat our people up every Sunday morning the Church of the Living God shouldn't be beat down they ought to be lifted up by the influence and the power of the holy spirit because when God goes to talking to you I got Bible when God goes to talking to you job stand up like a man amen look what he does he causes the person to rise up John falls on his face get up John I want to talk to you about some things and when God begins to influence a man he begins to pick them up that's why Peter walked by a man amen and said to him there at the gate called Beautiful rise up on your feet that's why brother Brandon walked in Georgie Carter's house amen nine years she couldn't get out of the bed but under the influence of the mighty Angel rise up on your feet in the name of Jesus Christ because there's power to re to rise the church under this message perception perception is everything now Satan will be successful with reasoning now his first knockdown punch on the human race was reasoning that's how he knocked the human race down the first time was he did it by reasoning and that's the way he does it every time but God has said he's going to try to reason Satan tries to reason you out of the idea that the word will work that the word really is true and the prophet of God said see Satan is always bringing he's always bringing that's his job that see that that's Satan's job is to bring it he said brother Wayne why is it I keep having these thoughts and why is these things keep coming by why does this keep happening because it's Satan's job to bring it right it's his job but you know what I got a job these men have a job that's right and you know what the prophet God said he said God's Army was to cast out the devil that's right that's God's method of dealing with the Devil is cast him out we don't make deals with the devil we don't feed them and entertain them and try to pet him around and try to make a place for them in our life amen we don't do that we cast them out we take them by the nap of the neck and throw them out the back door because that's God's method of dealing with Devils now you might sit here this morning say well there's no such thing as a devil and I'm not really having trouble and I'm not really sick brother B said no he said you are you really are maybe are sick and you really may be having trouble he said but the way to overcome that is to recognize it and then call it a devil recognize it's a devil he said then after you recognize it's a devil then you can say greater is he that's in me than he that's in this problem because it's the devil doing the tormenting and it's God doing the influencing who would influence you to speak the word of God who would influence you to confess God's word over your situation it would take God to influence you to do that and God gave us the word and that word will remove Satan anywhere any place at any time we can try an experiment right quick on the front row right here you try you want to try an experiment start thinking you're really bad person just start thinking I'm a bad person I'm never going to make it and then out of your mouth say I'm a Son of God now which one was more powerful when you said I'm a Son of God you can't think I'm a bad person when you're saying I'm a Son of God go ahead and try it sometime try to think and speak at the same time you can't do it you can't sit there and think opposite of what's coming out of your mouth amen because that's why the Bible said let the weak say I am strong let you go ahead and confess the word of God because God's give you a weapon this morning that will whip the devil anywhere any place any time under any condition but Satan don't want you using it h he don't want you using it at all but amen I take this morning I believe as Sons and Daughters of God listen if this was the last sermon I ever preached if this was the last thing I ever said to Full Gospel Lighthouse if this is the last thing that I would put on recording I would tell the Church of the Living God press this battle I would tell you press this battle I would tell you that you're going to win it if you don't stop fighting it I'm going to tell you that you're going to overcome every devil that you're going to overcome every trial I'm going to say there's no weapon that's formed against you that shall be able to prosper because God has already made it that you're going to overcome come on Church you say well brother Wayne I got Devils y'all keep saying that that that that no weapon formed against me will prosper y'all keep saying that but the devil's hitting me all the time well look up the word Prosper it doesn't mean it's not going to hit you it doesn't mean Satan's not going to come against you it means it will not have its desired goal against you in other words whatever plans that the devil made for your life God's going to cancel them whatever plans Satan has said God's going to cancel them because God is not controlled by the devil I got living evidence standing right there that cancer can't kill a man if God don't want it to there's there there it is 3 years ago around this same time of year or four now amen around the same time of year amen but listen amen Satan can't take a life amen until God says so Satan can't kill it the cancer can't kill it until God is done with it amen so you might as well tell the devil I'm going to enjoy the life that God gave me and I'm going to use it for the glory of God it can't take your Liv God has to make that decision so well brother Wayne I got depressed it's no it ain't going to kill you no anxiety ain't going to kill you your sickness ain't going to kill you listen because God has set a mark over your life and he's determined that it can't no weapon it can't Prosper it it came to have its desired goal y'all y'all remember that story of Paul bunan when he wrote the Pilgrim's Progress y'all remember that and you remember when he was cutting across the field and and they talked to a Christian into getting off the path and he took a a better path look like amen and he took it out there and him and hope took out across the field but they got in the Dominion of despondency amen they got into the Dominion of it and and that King that great giant of despondency amen found them on his land and captured them and carried them to his kingdom do you see what I'm talking about a Christian should never be in that land and when you get there you got another king over you and they captured him and put him in a put him in a in a cage and and Paul bunan did a good story writing it because he applied and gave them weapons to destroy their life he gave them things that they could take their life with and then he beat them up real bad and said you ain't never getting out of here you might as well go ahead and and take your life you might as well goad and after about the third day of doing them that way finally hope looks over at Christian and he says Christian have you realized amen he would take our life if he could amen if he could do it he would do it but he can't so he's trying to talk us into doing it ourselves because he don't have the power to do it and when Christian realized that he said but how can I get out of this and he remembered in the beginning of his journey he had been given a key that he wore around his neck and the key was called promise and promise would open every door in the dungeon of Despair under the king of despondency and let me say this this morning there's a key in your heart called faith and it'll open every door because God's made a promise that devil can't kill you take the key out unlock the door and go to walking out of this trouble go to walking out of your problems because it cannot Prosper against you so brother Wayne what do you want me to do press the battle Yeah we go through things and and and I've had Satan come to me oh yeah well you just might as well give up I'm not giving up you it don't make any difference what you do listen press the battle press the battle this Bible I we were going through a great trial over at home we were going through something that was pretty powerful and and I was praying about something and the scripture came to me and he said Satan is like a roaring lion going around seeking whom he may devour and when I got to thinking about that I thought I got up from prayer and I looked around the room and I said come here kitty come here kitty amen because you know what Amen to a Son of God who just come out of a place of prayer the devil ain't nothing but a kitty cat he might be a roaring line but change your perspective he ain't nothing but a kitty cat in the sight of the Church of the Living God you got a sword you got a promise press the battle press the battle press the battle don't you give up press this battle don't you turn around press this battle don't you give your don't you give your Victory away press this battle you're going to cross the finish line Church of the Living God press the battle I can see the Finish Line I can see the angel standing up press the battle you're going to win let our musicians come press the battle you're going to win so brother Wayne I don't think we're coming out of you're coming out of it yes sir yes sir they took old Joseph and they threw him in a pit and they beat him up pretty good but one of the brothers spoke up and said don't take his life so you know what Joseph knew he knew it didn't matter what happened now he was on his road to a throne right and it didn't matter whose hands he fell into his God was going to deliver him he was going to break him from the pit and he took him to a prison God had him on the way to a palace I tell you this morning folks press the battle whatever comes your way pick your sword up fight press the battle don't throw down your sword don't give up remember the future Whitney remember the future remember the future press the [Music] battle brother Bram said I went beyond the curtain of time and when I come back I wasn't the same William brandom anymore he said when I come back in the room I heard press press on press the battle I pray this morning I pray that you change your perspective see victory
