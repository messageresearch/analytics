[48:20] the journey
[48:22] amen i want to continue to pray for our
[48:24] pastor brother ron he been very sick
[48:27] and uh
[48:29] i just got a note from him just a few
[48:30] moments ago he's he's feeling much
[48:32] better
[48:33] and
[48:34] so we're just certainly thankful for
[48:36] that
[48:37] so
[48:39] leron is going to do his best to be able
[48:40] to speak in the morning for you and
[48:43] if anybody has a right to stay out he
[48:45] certainly he certainly has that right
[48:48] but
[48:49] i understand wanting to attack the enemy
[48:51] when you're under attack
[48:54] it's the greatest time to attack the
[48:56] enemy
[48:58] is when you're under attack because
[48:59] you're ready for war
[49:02] so i believe that
[49:03] if god is able and i know that he's able
[49:06] that brother ron will be here in the
[49:07] morning if not you'll be able to put up
[49:09] with me i trust so

[52:34] genesis 15
[52:35] and 1
[52:37] after these things the word of the lord
[52:39] came unto abram in a vision
[52:42] saying fear not abram i am thy shield
[52:44] and thy exceeding great reward
[52:47] and abram said lord god what wilt thou
[52:49] give me seeing i go childless and the
[52:52] steward of my house is this eliezer of
[52:55] damascus
[52:57] and abram said behold to me
[52:59] thou has given no seed and lo one born
[53:02] in my house is miner
[53:04] and behold the word of the lord came
[53:06] unto him saying
[53:07] this shall not be thine heir but he
[53:11] that shall come forth out of thine own
[53:13] bowel shall be thine heir and he brought
[53:15] him forth abroad and said look now
[53:18] toward heaven and tell the stars if thou
[53:21] be able to number them and he said unto
[53:24] him so shall thy seed be and he believed
[53:29] in the lord
[53:32] what an amazing thing
[53:35] he wasn't able to number all the stars
[53:37] but he believed him
[53:40] it's an amazing thing to believe the
[53:41] lord when there is a huge obstacle that
[53:43] is in front of you
[53:46] he believed in the lord and he counted
[53:48] it to him for righteousness
[53:51] habitat chapter 2
[53:53] and verse 2.
[53:58] and the lord answered me and said
[54:01] write the vision
[54:02] and make it plain
[54:04] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[54:07] it
[54:07] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[54:10] time
[54:11] but at the end it shall speak and not
[54:13] lie
[54:15] though it tarry
[54:17] wait for it
[54:21] i'm getting
[54:22] old wait for it
[54:25] i'm getting wrinkles wait for it
[54:29] i'm getting a getting a little slump in
[54:30] my back but wait for it
[54:35] i don't know if i can hold on but wait
[54:37] for it
[54:38] because it will surely come
[54:41] and it will not tarry
[54:43] may god bless his word you may be seated
[54:45] in the presence of the lord
[54:47] i'd like to speak to you this evening
[54:49] on a thought of the people of the vision
[54:53] and that we are living out the very
[54:56] vision of god and we know we know that
[54:59] we are living in an hour where there's
[55:01] not been others that could operate in
[55:04] this realm that you and i operate in but
[55:07] this is the hour of the eagle and this
[55:10] is the hour of the anointing the
[55:12] anointing of the eagle that comes upon
[55:14] the believer that has the ability to be
[55:17] able to look past and able to look
[55:19] through prophetic eyes and have an
[55:21] insight to be able to see a vision that
[55:23] has simply that has been laying there
[55:26] but yet there had been a forerunner that
[55:28] went before us and told us these things
[55:31] and
[55:32] laid these things out in the scripture
[55:34] and i believe that we are the people of
[55:37] an open vision but and not a people of a
[55:39] closed vision but a very much open
[55:41] vision and we realize that that men when
[55:44] they when they don't have a vision maybe
[55:47] a vision in business they they they will
[55:49] wonder everywhere but if men don't have
[55:51] a vision in in their spiritual life they
[55:54] they can never go on and the bible said
[55:56] that where there is no vision that the
[55:59] people perish and when there is no
[56:01] vision that is set before you you cannot
[56:04] run with that race but there is
[56:07] something that is laid before the church
[56:10] of the living god and you can look
[56:12] throughout the bible and you can look
[56:13] throughout the old testament and it's
[56:15] and it's filled its field of prophetic
[56:18] insight but there were men there were
[56:20] men there that had had been born born a
[56:24] prophet and was able and the bible would
[56:26] call them seers that they were able to
[56:28] foretell the future and be able to look
[56:31] into the future and go out there and
[56:33] though they might be standing on the
[56:35] same dirt that you and i are standing on
[56:37] they were able to look out into another
[56:40] world and go out there and tell the
[56:42] future of israel or maybe maybe it would
[56:44] be good that they would he would the
[56:46] prophet would go out there and tell him
[56:48] that you'll come back packing the
[56:49] victory or or maybe he the prophet would
[56:52] tell now don't go out there you're going
[56:53] to come back and be destroyed he would
[56:56] come and he would bring the prophetic
[56:58] insight to be able to go there by the
[57:01] way of a vision that god would give him
[57:04] it was not a gift of prophecy that was
[57:06] upon him but he was born a prophet and
[57:10] this is this was this is a completely
[57:12] different aspect or a different avenue
[57:15] or a different channel than that of one
[57:17] that was a fortune teller or a median
[57:19] but this man was anointed with the very
[57:22] spirit of god to be able to tell things
[57:25] that are to be just like we had a
[57:27] prophet standing this hour and was able
[57:30] to reach out into another world and be
[57:32] able to tell us things that are to be
[57:34] and i'm so thankful to be living in an
[57:36] hour that we are not sitting here with a
[57:39] closed book tonight but we're sitting
[57:41] here with a prophetic mind tonight to be
[57:43] able to look out there and the bride has
[57:46] the mind of christ tonight and she knows
[57:48] what he wants done with the word and he
[57:51] doesn't want it left laying down he
[57:52] doesn't want it sitting there and
[57:54] becoming stagnant but he wants that
[57:56] vision to be rolled out and you to run
[57:59] with that vision tonight i want you to
[58:01] know that that the message that you're
[58:03] running with luther could not have ran
[58:05] with that message because he didn't have
[58:07] the anointing to run with that message
[58:09] wesley could not run that with this
[58:12] message though he was a great man under
[58:14] the anointing of the man age he was
[58:16] there he lived out and he purposed in
[58:18] himself to do exactly what god portioned
[58:21] him to do but they could not run the
[58:24] message that you and i are running with
[58:26] tonight they didn't have the eyesight to
[58:28] be able to reach into that realm with an
[58:30] ego anointing because they were living
[58:32] in a different age and god had so
[58:34] ordained these men that that god held
[58:37] them in his hands as the seven stars to
[58:40] the seven church ages and he knew and he
[58:42] built each one man with a certain
[58:45] characteristic that they would carry
[58:47] themselves and they would handle
[58:48] themselves with the anointing of that
[58:51] age but here we are in this last age
[58:54] with another anointing by by the prophet
[58:57] that would say in malachi 4 that surely
[58:59] i will send you elijah the prophet
[59:02] before the great and dreadful day of the
[59:05] lord it's a great day for you and i
[59:07] but it's going to be a dreadful day for
[59:10] those that rejected this message
[59:12] that turned down to run with this
[59:14] message but god has a people that's
[59:17] willing to put their shoulder with this
[59:20] message and say i identify with that
[59:23] message i identify with that vision i
[59:26] identify with that prophet
[59:29] you see god had a man in his hand that
[59:31] he could entrust the very mind of god
[59:34] and he could go in there and bring that
[59:36] mind out and bring it to the people
[59:40] so you're not operating with with a
[59:42] closed vision this morning or this
[59:44] evening you're operating with an open
[59:46] vision
[59:48] is that right
[59:50] notice all down through those church
[59:52] ages that it was the holy spirit that
[59:54] was building a body in ephesus the holy
[59:57] spirit was building the body and through
[1:00:00] through the sumerian church age and the
[1:00:01] pergamus church age and the thytaran and
[1:00:04] all the way down through the dark cages
[1:00:06] even into the philadelphia and in this
[1:00:08] laodicean church age it was god the holy
[1:00:12] spirit that was operating and he was
[1:00:14] building himself a body that he had
[1:00:17] elected
[1:00:19] she didn't choose herself
[1:00:21] but he set her destiny
[1:00:24] he set her destiny before she could ever
[1:00:27] before she could ever run
[1:00:30] and that elect was is built to be a body
[1:00:33] and the elect will catch that message
[1:00:35] for her day
[1:00:36] and just like when when there would be
[1:00:38] others that would gather underneath
[1:00:40] paul's ministry when there would be men
[1:00:43] like john or men like men like polycarp
[1:00:45] that would come and they would stand
[1:00:47] under the anointing when wesley would
[1:00:50] come spurgeon would rise up underneath
[1:00:52] of him you'd have men in wigglesworth
[1:00:54] that would rise up under under under the
[1:00:57] anointing or the or the messenger of
[1:00:59] that day and here we are in the day of
[1:01:02] the seventh angel and there are men like
[1:01:06] william borlapon there's men like ron
[1:01:08] spencer and there's men like wayne
[1:01:10] lawson that run with a message that that
[1:01:13] prophet has came and delivered that
[1:01:15] message and i say he did well but you
[1:01:18] are not operating just as it just as a
[1:01:20] people that don't know what you're doing
[1:01:23] you're a people of a message
[1:01:26] and when you get to the running line
[1:01:28] you're going to get there and you're
[1:01:29] going to have the answer in your hand
[1:01:31] you'll be able to enter in and you will
[1:01:34] hear a voice that says well done my good
[1:01:36] and faithful servant
[1:01:37] [Applause]
[1:01:41] oh i ain't just going to leave it to the
[1:01:43] preachers god's raised up but god's
[1:01:45] raised up some andrew glovers but i'll
[1:01:47] say this god's raised up some jerry
[1:01:50] breedings god's raised up some tom hills
[1:01:53] god's raised up some seth ankles god has
[1:01:56] raised up some real sons and daughters
[1:01:59] of god
[1:02:00] they're operating by a vision
[1:02:03] and they know where they're standing at
[1:02:05] and satan can do everything he wants to
[1:02:08] them
[1:02:09] they're operating in a vision that can't
[1:02:11] be stopped
[1:02:12] [Applause]
[1:02:14] i'm in the vision
[1:02:16] i'm in the vision
[1:02:19] we are the people of the vision
[1:02:25] glory
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:29] now notice
[1:02:31] i know you know these things but just to
[1:02:33] set a precedent
[1:02:36] and brother branham when he would say in
[1:02:38] in the sermon what visions are
[1:02:40] he said a vision is god
[1:02:43] by a word of knowledge dropping into a
[1:02:45] person to foresee
[1:02:46] or foresee something that tells
[1:02:48] something
[1:02:49] that has been or something that will be
[1:02:53] now a vision does not heal you
[1:02:56] a vision is what god is showing to build
[1:02:58] your faith to a place to accept the
[1:03:00] finished work of christ at calvary he
[1:03:02] said how many knows that how many can
[1:03:04] thoroughly understand that there's
[1:03:06] nothing that i have to heal you
[1:03:08] or the vision won't heal you
[1:03:11] but notice he said now a vision will
[1:03:13] come
[1:03:14] to build a person
[1:03:16] now to think that if you took a person
[1:03:18] that may be maybe sitting there or in a
[1:03:20] condition where they were dying or had
[1:03:22] some dreadful disease
[1:03:24] but that man
[1:03:25] that man once he heard
[1:03:27] when she heard what the vision had spoke
[1:03:30] about him though he may have been dying
[1:03:32] or had awful disease
[1:03:34] by that vision he was able i can't
[1:03:37] explain how that you can appropriate
[1:03:39] enough faith and it don't even make
[1:03:42] sense sometimes
[1:03:43] but you notice when when a man may be
[1:03:45] dying or had some some have tuberculosis
[1:03:49] or cancer or some other shadow of death
[1:03:51] that would be upon him that that
[1:03:54] prophetic vision would be able to go out
[1:03:56] and say now i see you're dealing with
[1:03:58] this but thus saith the lord you're
[1:04:00] healed
[1:04:02] that man that it was stood taken place
[1:04:04] or that woman that it was taking place
[1:04:06] over that woman could have and
[1:04:09] appropriate enough faith it wasn't the
[1:04:11] vision that healed her it was just to
[1:04:14] show that the one that gave the vision
[1:04:16] was close
[1:04:19] and what was it doing it was taking that
[1:04:21] person that may be sick and body or
[1:04:24] maybe done with cancer he was giving him
[1:04:27] the ability to go from a dead man to a
[1:04:30] living man
[1:04:31] it was building him up it was taking him
[1:04:34] from a spot of death to a spot of life
[1:04:37] the vision didn't do it but his faith in
[1:04:40] what the master was doing
[1:04:43] was showing that the one that gave the
[1:04:45] vision it was not william branham
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:50] maybe your maybe your pastor may have a
[1:04:52] vision about you but it's not it's not
[1:04:54] the man it's your faith and who brought
[1:04:58] the vision
[1:05:00] i want you to get comfortable and saying
[1:05:02] i am in the vision
[1:05:05] you see it's not the vision that makes
[1:05:08] you what you are god has already seen
[1:05:10] you as you are
[1:05:12] and you will accomplish everything that
[1:05:14] god has set for you in your life
[1:05:20] hallelujah vision can build you up
[1:05:23] just like when noah when he was building
[1:05:25] an ark what was he doing he went out
[1:05:27] there and it seemed ridiculous to
[1:05:29] everybody else but he was following a
[1:05:32] vision
[1:05:33] it seems ridiculous why in the world
[1:05:35] while there's a worldwide movement while
[1:05:38] there's a people following a vision
[1:05:41] that believes that this is elijah's
[1:05:44] ministry
[1:05:45] that believes that this is the message
[1:05:47] that'll get her out of this chaos it
[1:05:49] seems ridiculous to those that don't
[1:05:52] believe
[1:05:53] but we found our right mind when we
[1:05:55] found the mind of christ
[1:05:59] noah was out there working every day
[1:06:01] cutting down gopher wood sure he may
[1:06:04] have looked it like a crazy looked like
[1:06:06] a crazy out to the rest of the world but
[1:06:08] he was building that ark according to
[1:06:11] the vision
[1:06:11] [Music]
[1:06:13] are you with me now i want you to know
[1:06:15] that inside of that vision it had the
[1:06:18] power to raise noah above all the waves
[1:06:22] it had the power to raise him above
[1:06:24] every critic
[1:06:27] that vision had the power to shut the
[1:06:29] mouth of critics because it wasn't man
[1:06:31] constructed it was god constructed
[1:06:34] in 120 years he was living out the
[1:06:37] vision
[1:06:38] for 120 years he kept preaching the same
[1:06:41] thing
[1:06:43] and you get mad at me because i keep
[1:06:45] preaching on prodigals returning
[1:06:47] you get mad at me because i keep
[1:06:49] preaching on deliverance i get the
[1:06:51] preaching on the holy spirit and you get
[1:06:53] upset well he's preached on that before
[1:06:55] how about setting in noah it's gonna
[1:06:58] rain
[1:07:00] what's new today it's going to rain it
[1:07:03] will be this message that will raise
[1:07:06] noah out of the chaos
[1:07:10] oh hallelujah for 120 years he preached
[1:07:14] the message for 120 years he lived out
[1:07:17] the vision let me say it like this
[1:07:19] noah's life was the vision
[1:07:23] and when it come time for everything to
[1:07:26] run into that ark he was right in line
[1:07:29] with the vision
[1:07:31] let me say what happened in noah he
[1:07:34] walked in at one spot
[1:07:36] and he got out of another
[1:07:38] i want you to know you're servant of god
[1:07:40] that don't just know how to get you in
[1:07:42] he knows how to get you out
[1:07:46] well i come in down in elkton but you're
[1:07:49] gonna come out in glory
[1:07:53] noah stepped in in his homeland and he'd
[1:07:56] come out on mount ariat
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:00] i stepped in in canada but i stepped out
[1:08:03] in glory
[1:08:05] you stepped out in a hospital room but
[1:08:08] god seen you
[1:08:11] [Applause]
[1:08:13] i'm in the vision
[1:08:20] you can imagine noah's family
[1:08:23] we're right behind this thing
[1:08:24] everything he says i'm getting behind
[1:08:26] him
[1:08:28] sure it seems crazy but i'm getting
[1:08:29] behind him
[1:08:31] it seemed crazy until the rain started
[1:08:34] to fall
[1:08:37] this message seems crazy to a dying
[1:08:40] drunk generation drunk on her own vomit
[1:08:43] drunk on all things of the world on
[1:08:46] creeds and dogmas and she's a house of
[1:08:48] every unclean and caged bird
[1:08:52] it's crazy to them why you think the way
[1:08:54] you think
[1:08:55] but noah's family could say i rode that
[1:08:58] vision right to my destiny
[1:09:00] [Applause]
[1:09:02] noah's family got in and when they got
[1:09:04] out they were in a new place
[1:09:09] don't you brothers wish you could do
[1:09:11] some house transformation like that when
[1:09:14] she wants the curtains moved when she
[1:09:16] wants everything just wait just a little
[1:09:18] bit baby god's gonna open a door for you
[1:09:24] everything's gonna look different i'm
[1:09:25] gonna i tell you what you don't like
[1:09:27] what you're living at i'm gonna put you
[1:09:28] on a mountain
[1:09:35] help me jesus
[1:09:37] now notice
[1:09:39] in the days of samuel the bible said
[1:09:41] that the word was precious in those days
[1:09:44] because there was
[1:09:46] no open vision and a vision
[1:09:49] is the direct word of the lord
[1:09:53] he say amen
[1:09:54] and god has promised that he would
[1:09:56] always meet the need of the hour he
[1:09:58] always does that and that's what we need
[1:10:00] today is the very voice of god to meet
[1:10:04] the need of this hour
[1:10:07] what has been seen about you
[1:10:10] you will accomplish
[1:10:13] now notice in the key to the door
[1:10:15] brother baron said
[1:10:16] he said any key cannot unlock a door
[1:10:19] until it's used by hand
[1:10:22] it's got to have something to use the
[1:10:24] key the key itself cannot use itself
[1:10:27] it's got to have something to yield the
[1:10:30] key
[1:10:32] now it's not the way it is and now
[1:10:35] that's the way it is
[1:10:37] in preaching the gospel it's not that we
[1:10:39] ourselves are as ministers
[1:10:41] we are not the gospel but we are only
[1:10:44] transmitters that transmits the voice of
[1:10:46] god through our agency
[1:10:49] of man to the hearing a vision is the
[1:10:52] same way i know nothing to say to the
[1:10:54] church at this time concerning a vision
[1:10:57] but if the holy spirit would show me
[1:10:59] first division then i transmit that
[1:11:02] vision to the one that it's directed to
[1:11:05] so it's not me my
[1:11:08] the vision was not me i
[1:11:10] it was god that gave the vision and i
[1:11:13] acted as a transmitter to bring forth
[1:11:16] the message of the vision to the people
[1:11:21] he said now he said it's just like a key
[1:11:23] same thing he said the key is only to be
[1:11:25] held in that hand that unlocks the door
[1:11:28] see it's got to be a hand now in the key
[1:11:31] i'm going to speak about tonight is the
[1:11:33] only one hand can hold this key and
[1:11:36] that's the hand of faith it's the only
[1:11:38] thing that can hold this key
[1:11:40] and hands hold other keys but it takes
[1:11:43] the hand of faith
[1:11:45] for that
[1:11:47] you see just like as we said about the
[1:11:49] vision it takes a faith to be able to
[1:11:53] unlock if a man is sick or a man's got a
[1:11:56] disease or man's got some something
[1:11:58] going on or some case in his life he's
[1:12:01] got to be able to look by a vision and
[1:12:04] see a perfectly well body
[1:12:06] but it's that faith that takes him to
[1:12:09] that perfectly well body
[1:12:12] i want to say that over top of you
[1:12:15] is a vision of a perfectly well body
[1:12:18] i want to say over top of you is a
[1:12:21] vision of a people that's going in
[1:12:23] rapture
[1:12:24] over top of you is a vision of people
[1:12:27] that will destroy cancer that will
[1:12:30] destroy sin that will destroy addictions
[1:12:33] that will destroy all kinds of anxiety
[1:12:38] but it's you that's gonna walk
[1:12:41] walk right to the vision
[1:12:44] now notice just just just just delay
[1:12:47] some things isaiah isaiah prophesied
[1:12:50] 712 years before
[1:12:53] before john the baptist ever got on the
[1:12:55] scene he prophesied that there was a
[1:12:58] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:13:01] and when john stood there and he was
[1:13:04] preaching when he was preaching baptism
[1:13:07] those people could say
[1:13:09] we are in the vision
[1:13:11] of isaiah
[1:13:14] when when god would speak to isaiah and
[1:13:17] he would say that a virgin is going to
[1:13:19] conceive
[1:13:22] it seemed it seemed very unprecedented
[1:13:24] how in the world this man could make
[1:13:26] this kind of statement but when he come
[1:13:28] to mary
[1:13:29] she could say i am the prophet's vision
[1:13:33] when when when god when he would speak
[1:13:36] to jeremiah when he would speak to him
[1:13:38] in jeremiah 1 he said before you were
[1:13:41] formed in your mother's womb i knew you
[1:13:44] i called you i ordained you to be a
[1:13:47] prophet
[1:13:48] you see god has a long-range vision
[1:13:52] he's not caught up with where you are
[1:13:55] he's only caught up away you're going to
[1:13:57] be at
[1:13:59] and jeremiah had gotten to a spot one
[1:14:01] time that he said that i'll no longer
[1:14:04] prophesy in your name i no longer stand
[1:14:06] there in your name he said but the word
[1:14:08] of the lord is like a fire that is shut
[1:14:11] up in my bones i can't keep it out
[1:14:14] you see you can try everything you want
[1:14:16] to
[1:14:17] to try to stop the vision you can try to
[1:14:19] shut your mouse
[1:14:22] i could preach all day right there but i
[1:14:23] won't
[1:14:25] you can try to shut your mouth but the
[1:14:26] vision will come to pass
[1:14:31] the vision says you'll be here
[1:14:34] the vision will be just as it was spoken
[1:14:39] now now now i know i know all of you
[1:14:42] know this
[1:14:43] most of you know it maybe maybe some of
[1:14:44] the young people here don't know it but
[1:14:46] before brother ron became the pastor
[1:14:48] here
[1:14:50] brother ron was in christiansburg
[1:14:52] virginia and he was he was working
[1:14:53] alongside with us with his dad charlie
[1:14:56] spencer that just went off and went on
[1:14:57] to be with the lord
[1:14:59] but in the year 2000 or just before that
[1:15:02] when brother ron come to be pastor here
[1:15:05] the lord had given him a vision that he
[1:15:07] was pastoring at a church that had
[1:15:09] crosses in its doors
[1:15:11] and all of you old-timers you you know
[1:15:14] that that our doors back here
[1:15:16] jew used to have crosses in it and he
[1:15:18] went and told sister khan he said now
[1:15:20] look he said he said this is what i seen
[1:15:23] that i was pastoring a church i was
[1:15:25] pastoring a church that had crosses in
[1:15:28] its doors
[1:15:29] and he and when he walked through the
[1:15:31] building said this is that
[1:15:35] and we have it i could get it down and
[1:15:37] show it to you but it's about 15 feet in
[1:15:39] the air and i didn't want to get it down
[1:15:40] to see him because i might have broke my
[1:15:41] neck for a preach so i didn't do that
[1:15:43] but we got it back here if you ever want
[1:15:44] to see
[1:15:45] what what the vision was
[1:15:47] those crosses back there but i want you
[1:15:50] to think about the process of that
[1:15:52] vision
[1:15:53] you know god knew that that was going to
[1:15:55] come to pass
[1:15:56] god knew where he was going to be and he
[1:15:59] knew what year it was going to be at
[1:16:01] but could you imagine could you imagine
[1:16:04] life without that vision
[1:16:07] could you imagine could maybe maybe i'll
[1:16:09] just put some things out there i can't
[1:16:11] imagine living life without that vision
[1:16:14] this is my home this is my home church
[1:16:17] to think if that vision wouldn't have
[1:16:19] happened maybe you could put it in that
[1:16:22] way if the vision wouldn't have happened
[1:16:25] brother ron may not have been here
[1:16:28] in the mind of god it would have worked
[1:16:29] out that way but just just allow your
[1:16:31] mind just to drift for a moment what if
[1:16:33] the vision didn't come to pass
[1:16:36] where would my life be
[1:16:40] let me let me just break some things
[1:16:41] down for you i would i would have
[1:16:43] probably never been a preacher under a
[1:16:45] sitting there in charlottesville
[1:16:47] virginia i'd have probably never never
[1:16:49] been there or maybe not have been in
[1:16:50] that condition i may have never met my
[1:16:52] wife the way i met her i may never have
[1:16:54] the children away i mean everything is
[1:16:57] hanging on that vision
[1:17:00] and remember it's a direct word from the
[1:17:03] lord
[1:17:06] but let's look on the other side of the
[1:17:07] vision
[1:17:08] the vision happened
[1:17:10] and look at this church
[1:17:12] the vision happened and look at our
[1:17:13] young people the vision happened and
[1:17:16] look what brother homer stood behind
[1:17:19] look what happened
[1:17:21] full gospel lighthouse you are here
[1:17:24] because of vision
[1:17:28] i'd say it looked completely different
[1:17:29] today if it wasn't for the vision but we
[1:17:32] are at people
[1:17:35] by the vision for the vision
[1:17:39] and we are against division
[1:17:42] but even jesus said himself he said
[1:17:45] i can do nothing
[1:17:47] except my father first shows me
[1:17:50] he was operating
[1:17:52] in a world
[1:17:54] of vision
[1:17:56] there have been a lot of people that
[1:17:57] said no brother andrew or brother on go
[1:17:58] go lay your hands go create go do this
[1:18:01] thing go brother random go do this go go
[1:18:04] go go there's many people that tried to
[1:18:07] get man
[1:18:08] out of the will of god
[1:18:12] asked him one time brother branham
[1:18:15] have a vision for me
[1:18:17] he said well you dreamed me a dream he
[1:18:18] said it's impossible he said it's your
[1:18:21] faith that causes that
[1:18:23] he said i don't do that myself
[1:18:26] he said if i could do that i would he
[1:18:28] said but i can't do that
[1:18:30] you see
[1:18:31] you see the prophet was operating right
[1:18:34] where god wanted him to be and you
[1:18:36] remember when he was over there in
[1:18:38] africa and those men said they set him
[1:18:41] up and they told him and go do these
[1:18:42] things and he suffered he suffered a
[1:18:44] great deal for that and went through
[1:18:45] that trial great trial
[1:18:47] because he wasn't in the perfect will of
[1:18:49] god sure there was great things that
[1:18:51] happened sure there was lives that were
[1:18:53] changed but it wasn't the perfect will
[1:18:56] of god it was the permissive
[1:19:00] and that's where people get in trouble
[1:19:02] it's when they get out of the perfect
[1:19:04] will of god and get over on his
[1:19:06] permissive will
[1:19:08] yes god's a good god but he's also a
[1:19:10] good he's a good judge too
[1:19:13] yes he's a god of love but he's also a
[1:19:15] god of wrath
[1:19:19] but you remember when that
[1:19:21] this is this message is full of visions
[1:19:23] and i could preach this i could preach
[1:19:25] this forever anybody could come up here
[1:19:27] brother william brother matthew come up
[1:19:28] here and take these notes and they could
[1:19:30] preach these same exact things
[1:19:33] but i'm the one that caught the vision
[1:19:37] i'm the one that caught the vision to be
[1:19:39] able to preach that god dropped down a
[1:19:41] channel and brought the channel where i
[1:19:43] was sitting out and studying all of a
[1:19:45] sudden there came a voice that said
[1:19:47] speak these things
[1:19:49] you remember you remember about a little
[1:19:50] lady when that little lady had a little
[1:19:52] mexican lady down there and her baby had
[1:19:55] died early that morning and she'd come
[1:19:57] into that and she'd come into that tent
[1:20:00] and her baby had died and billy paul
[1:20:02] said daddy we got this woman back here
[1:20:04] we got this woman back there that's
[1:20:06] fighting through every ushers she's
[1:20:08] climbing over top of them crawling
[1:20:09] underneath her legs
[1:20:11] so what's it what's the deal billy said
[1:20:13] well the baby died her baby died and
[1:20:16] he said she's wanting to get to you
[1:20:18] and they had rules the way they had to
[1:20:20] set up the prayer line headline prayer
[1:20:22] cards and different things you know how
[1:20:24] it was and so he said no he said i can't
[1:20:26] go back there or it'll create a it'll
[1:20:29] create a people and they'll just they'll
[1:20:30] create a chaos and they'll come and
[1:20:32] they'll want everybody to come lay hands
[1:20:34] but he said brother jack you go back
[1:20:36] there and pray for that woman so you
[1:20:37] don't know me
[1:20:40] and as brother jack was going to go pray
[1:20:42] for her
[1:20:43] the lord showed brother branham a vision
[1:20:46] he showed him a baby
[1:20:49] a baby that was right or a baby that was
[1:20:52] living well a little spanish baby that
[1:20:54] that was crying and and it was perfectly
[1:20:57] well
[1:21:00] now notice brother branham said i didn't
[1:21:01] know if this was that baby or not
[1:21:04] he said but bring me that baby
[1:21:07] bring me that baby
[1:21:09] he said all i could do he said i'd seen
[1:21:11] the vision
[1:21:12] he said but this baby he said i knew
[1:21:15] what the baby looked like but this baby
[1:21:17] was wrapped up in a wet blanket
[1:21:21] that had been raining and that woman had
[1:21:23] been fighting just to get into the
[1:21:25] meeting
[1:21:27] wonder would you fight like that
[1:21:33] i wonder i wonder oh it's a saturday
[1:21:36] night i've worked all week long but
[1:21:37] would you really fight
[1:21:39] to get where jesus is at
[1:21:42] i will i don't know if it'll be me or
[1:21:44] not but the vision has spoken
[1:21:47] and the vision will be exactly as it was
[1:21:50] said
[1:21:51] he said i didn't know if it was this or
[1:21:52] not but i could sit there and he said i
[1:21:55] humbly he said i humbly bow my head and
[1:21:57] i begin to pray
[1:22:00] he said i began to pray and he said all
[1:22:02] of a sudden that baby let out a scream
[1:22:05] what happened that baby recognized that
[1:22:08] i'm in the vision that's me he said that
[1:22:11] baby began to kick off that wet blanket
[1:22:14] and started to scream
[1:22:16] because a mama was persevering and had
[1:22:18] love like that she began baby begin to
[1:22:21] kick off those wet blankets
[1:22:23] i'm afraid there's some message people
[1:22:25] that need to kick off these evangelists
[1:22:27] and pastors that are wet blankets that
[1:22:30] are trying to stop our pastors and
[1:22:32] trying to stop the move of god kick
[1:22:34] those wet blankets off of you i'm in the
[1:22:37] vision i'm where the holy spirit's at
[1:22:42] i'm going to stay right here on my
[1:22:43] fishing
[1:22:45] get that thing off me i'm coming out
[1:22:49] i'm in the vision kick them wet blankets
[1:22:52] off of you trying to give you some cold
[1:22:54] formal religion kick it off of you you
[1:22:57] need the fire of the holy ghost to sit
[1:22:59] on your altar
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:03] well glory
[1:23:10] jesus said i
[1:23:12] john 15 and 5 he said i am the vine and
[1:23:14] you are the branches
[1:23:16] and he that abideth in me and on him the
[1:23:18] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:23:20] without me you can do nothing can you
[1:23:22] say that without me
[1:23:25] you can do nothing
[1:23:27] but if a man abide not in me he is cast
[1:23:30] forth as a branch
[1:23:32] and is withered and men gather them and
[1:23:34] cast them into the fire and they are
[1:23:36] burned
[1:23:36] and he said if you abide in me and my
[1:23:39] words about in you ask
[1:23:44] i mean he's got him abiding in you
[1:23:45] tonight
[1:23:46] he said if my words abide in you you
[1:23:48] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[1:23:51] done unto you
[1:23:53] or you live in innovation
[1:23:56] where the word of god has said you can
[1:23:57] have it if you ask for it but the reason
[1:24:00] why you don't have it is because you
[1:24:01] don't ask for it but he said ask that
[1:24:04] your joy might be full knock and it
[1:24:06] shall be opened unto you
[1:24:08] what are you doing i'm just opening the
[1:24:10] door for the vision

[1:42:31] and the lord discerned her very heart
[1:42:36] it said y'all see that you're barren
[1:42:39] and you have no child
[1:42:41] but i also see
[1:42:43] i also see that you're you have a
[1:42:45] terrible disease of tuberculosis

[1:43:13] said that man must be some kind
[1:43:15] psychologist psychiatrist or a mind
[1:43:17] reader
[1:43:19] and she began to doubt what was spoken
[1:43:21] over her but her husband said but wait
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:25] he said thus saveth the lord
[1:43:28] and this woman
[1:43:30] she fell into a spot of tuberculosis and
[1:43:33] was laid up in a bed for eight years
[1:43:37] eight years because doubt began to enter
[1:43:40] in because a pastor turned down the
[1:43:42] voice of truth
[1:43:48] so when brother branham goes back
[1:43:49] through canada and he goes up there and

[1:44:04] story about all this to take place
[1:44:07] he said but why did she doubt the vision
[1:44:10] said well it waited for so long it
[1:44:13] lingered for so long she just began to
[1:44:15] doubt
[1:44:16] he said i had the vision and the vision
[1:44:19] is never wrong he said it can't be
[1:44:21] hindered
[1:44:22] and he went back through there
[1:44:24] he went back through there several years
[1:44:26] later
[1:44:27] and there he got a phone call that
[1:44:29] sister noble was healed of that
[1:44:31] tuberculosis and she had that baby boy
[1:44:35] he said you're gonna have an eight pound
[1:44:37] baby boy and when she come through

[1:45:32] when moses sent out when he sent out
[1:45:35] 12 spies to go over in that land
[1:45:40] they didn't come back
[1:45:42] they didn't come back and say their
[1:45:43] mother tim was wrong
[1:45:45] but they said that we're more than able
[1:45:47] to take it
[1:45:52] there's grass we look like grasshoppers
[1:45:55] compared to them giants over there
[1:45:57] they didn't argue with them
[1:45:59] they just simply said we're more than
[1:46:00] able to take it
[1:46:02] what were they looking at they were
[1:46:03] looking at the vision
[1:46:07] that this was their land
[1:46:13] i was listening brother branham this
[1:46:14] week and he said speak to the rock
[1:46:17] he said now here those men come back he
[1:46:19] said he said it was a good land
[1:46:21] he said there they were in all those
[1:46:22] years he said they'd never ate such such
[1:46:25] food like they were getting ready to
[1:46:26] enter into he said they were only given
[1:46:28] slave rations
[1:46:30] he said but there was a land over there
[1:46:33] there was a land over there that they
[1:46:34] carried back that cluster of grapes that
[1:46:36] it took two men to be able to carry
[1:46:38] and brother branham said he said you
[1:46:40] think about that land he said you think
[1:46:43] about that land he said if a cursed land
[1:46:45] could produce that kind of grapes he
[1:46:47] said what could it produce when it got
[1:46:48] blessed
[1:46:52] you think about your life and you think
[1:46:53] about all that all how that you have
[1:46:56] been blessed throughout all your life
[1:46:58] and you ain't live for them one day
[1:47:01] you think about if you're living in a
[1:47:02] cursed life you just wait till you get
[1:47:04] into a blessing
[1:47:06] what kind of life you're really going to
[1:47:07] produce you think about you think about
[1:47:10] when you come back packing the evidence
[1:47:12] of the holy ghost
[1:47:14] and every single time you come back
[1:47:16] packing out the evidence of a land
[1:47:18] there's going to be an enemy that'll
[1:47:19] rise up say hey it's too big for us
[1:47:23] but there's going to be somebody that'll
[1:47:24] be a caleb said we're more than able
[1:47:27] you know why caleb was able to do that
[1:47:29] because the bible said that he was of
[1:47:31] another spirit
[1:47:33] and you are not like the church world
[1:47:36] you're of another spirit that same
[1:47:38] spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwells
[1:47:41] in you
[1:47:44] we got some evidence to talk about
[1:47:46] we got some gabriel spencers we got some
[1:47:49] sarah spencers
[1:47:51] we got some kimberly martin sitting here
[1:47:54] we got some kayla sitting here
[1:47:58] we got some nathan noel sitting here we
[1:48:00] got some jim noel sitting here
[1:48:05] we got some tom hill sitting here we got
[1:48:07] some mountain frasers sitting here
[1:48:10] we got evidence that it's a good land
[1:48:13] [Applause]
[1:48:14] so you young people look up
[1:48:16] if they can do it you can do it
[1:48:26] we got evidence that god still heals
[1:48:28] we got evidence that god still delivers
[1:48:33] you want some evidence there was a lady
[1:48:35] one time that was it that was in a
[1:48:37] prayer line it was in a prayer line and
[1:48:39] there was a sister bruce you heard about
[1:48:40] her own tape and sister bruce was a
[1:48:42] prayer warrior and she was healed one
[1:48:44] time of cancer and then she was a prayer
[1:48:47] warrior and she got a burden on her life
[1:48:49] she would get a burden on her heart for
[1:48:50] somebody and she'd go to praying about
[1:48:52] them and brother branham was he was he
[1:48:55] was in a line of discernment one time
[1:48:57] and sister bruce was praying for this
[1:48:59] sister and at that moment the spirit of
[1:49:02] the lord began to discern her heart and
[1:49:04] tell her how things were and this lady
[1:49:06] was dealing with throat cancer
[1:49:08] she was dealing with throat cancer and
[1:49:10] had this great big lump in her throat he
[1:49:14] was going to kill her and the doctor
[1:49:15] said that she wouldn't get well
[1:49:19] but the spirit of the lord
[1:49:21] began to curse that cancer
[1:49:24] he cursed the very life of that cancer
[1:49:26] and thus saith the lord you're healed
[1:49:30] she went home
[1:49:32] and that lump was still there
[1:49:34] she went home and could still barely
[1:49:36] swallow
[1:49:38] but brother branham said she went to a
[1:49:40] coffin fit said she went to a coffin fit
[1:49:44] and when she began to cough brother
[1:49:45] branham said that cancer jumped out of
[1:49:47] her throat
[1:49:51] i'd say it's time that cancer gets a
[1:49:53] jumping fit and jumps right out of the
[1:49:55] body of christ
[1:49:57] you're not welcome here we have cursed
[1:50:00] the life of cancer we have cursed the
[1:50:02] life of pornography we have cursed the
[1:50:05] life of anxiety
[1:50:06] [Applause]
[1:50:08] you've been given power to bind that
[1:50:10] mamba
[1:50:12] in the name of jesus christ whatsoever
[1:50:14] you bind on earth shall be bound in
[1:50:17] heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth
[1:50:19] shall be loosed in heaven
[1:50:24] oh hallelujah where two of you are free
[1:50:26] together in my name there i will be in
[1:50:29] the midst of them
[1:50:35] cancer's got to jump
[1:50:39] go ahead let him jump
[1:50:43] go ahead and kick that crab out
[1:50:45] he'd go ahead and he can grab on your
[1:50:47] life
[1:50:48] he'll grab on your life and all kinds of
[1:50:50] sin he comes in there to kill to steal
[1:50:53] and destroy he don't want to just make
[1:50:55] you sick he wants to kill you but god
[1:50:58] has come to give you life and more
[1:51:00] abundantly
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:05] you will have full victory
[1:51:12] it's time the body of cancer starts
[1:51:14] moving out
[1:51:16] because we don't curse the life of it
[1:51:20] we done cursed the life we didn't curse
[1:51:22] the life of all kinds of diseases off of
[1:51:24] you we cursed the life of it now it's
[1:51:26] time for the body of it to leave
[1:51:30] all cancer is is a bruised cell and it
[1:51:33] starts attaching itself to other cells
[1:51:36] and it starts binding itself and it's
[1:51:39] demons calling out for one another
[1:51:42] they're calling out for help and they
[1:51:44] start grabbing on and they're going
