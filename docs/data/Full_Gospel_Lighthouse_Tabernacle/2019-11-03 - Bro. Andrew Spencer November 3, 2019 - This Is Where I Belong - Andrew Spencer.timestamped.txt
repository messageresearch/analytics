[8:04] age it is his life that is flowing and
[8:08] pulsating in the church giving her life
[8:11] and without him there would be no life
[8:14] salvation is of the Lord there was no
[8:19] one with him when he tried the
[8:20] fierceness of the wrath of the fiery
[8:23] furnace it was not another but him who
[8:26] hung upon the cross and gave his blood
[8:28] he is the author and the finisher of our
[8:31] faith he is the Alpha and Omega of our
[8:35] salvation
[8:36] we are espoused to him and not another
[8:39] we don't belong to the church we belong
[8:43] to him

[8:53] midst of the churches it is God in her

[13:29] the preeminence in the name of Jesus
[13:32] Christ and the Bride of Christ says a
[13:34] man a man may God bless you you may be

[13:41] is where we belong I hope you don't mind
[13:44] I hope you don't mind me speaking these
[13:46] things that's where God continues to
[13:48] bless us at and lead us to and I believe
[13:51] we found our our spot in life that we
[13:54] belong and I believe that's where we
[13:55] should stay is in the spot that God
[13:57] blesses us and the Bible said in Psalms
[14:01] 47 and for that he shall choose our
[14:04] inheritance for us he has he shows in
[14:06] the place that we belong in and this is
[14:10] the land of our inheritance this this
[14:12] gospel that we preach this is the land
[14:15] of our inheritance and it's God's will
[14:18] for us to inhabit the promises of God
[14:20] not for us to leave them sitting on our
[14:23] coffee table and and sitting there on
[14:25] our on our bar and sitting there at our
[14:28] house it is our job and our duty to feed
[14:31] on this word to take the little book eat
[14:33] that little book become the little book
[14:36] it's God's will that we inhabit these
[14:38] promises and and he is not a God that
[14:40] keeps things to himself but he's a good
[14:43] God he's a God that knows how to give
[14:45] good gifts you see we know how to give
[14:48] good gifts and Jesus said howbeit that
[14:50] you being evil know how to give good
[14:53] gifts
[14:54] how much more about your heavenly Father
[14:56] how much more said he give you those
[14:58] good things and those things that you
[15:00] asked of tonight I believe tonight I
[15:02] want to start this out with a challenge
[15:04] I believe tonight that that you can have
[15:07] what if so ever you ask in the name of
[15:09] Jesus tonight I I told you I was coming
[15:12] tonight and I was going to blow hails
[15:13] doors off with what I've got to say
[15:15] and so by the help of the Lord tonight I
[15:18] want to preach to you on on where we
[15:21] belong that this is our land and if God
[15:24] gave us this land we should do
[15:26] everything within our power to protect
[15:29] this land to keep this land to defend
[15:32] this land he's a good God he's given us
[15:35] the very best that he could absolutely
[15:36] give when he gave us the word he didn't
[15:39] give us some week he didn't give us some
[15:41] week weapon he gave us the greatest
[15:43] weapon that's ever been placed in the
[15:45] hand of humans in your hand tonight the
[15:49] Moses had a rod in his hand but in your
[15:51] hand tonight is a living word in your
[15:55] hand tonight is a sharp two-edged sword
[15:57] and when you remember in sabino canyon
[16:00] when a Kings sword came down he was not
[16:03] a king sword it was the King's sword and
[16:06] it didn't come down with a Seif upon it
[16:08] he came down ready to go to battle and
[16:11] you are the people of the open book
[16:13] you're the people of the land you're the
[16:15] people of the King's sword and learn a
[16:17] word where the Kings word is there is
[16:20] power I say to you tonight by the power
[16:23] of Almighty God the Kings word is in
[16:26] this place the word of the Lord is in
[16:30] this place the king of kings is in this
[16:32] place there's power here tonight
[16:37] hallelujah God has given us everything
[16:39] that we have need of in our journey when
[16:42] he gave us the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:44] everything you have need of he gave it
[16:47] to you right there you see he brought us
[16:50] to a land of promise he didn't bring us
[16:52] through a land of lies in a land of
[16:54] imagination he brought us to a land of
[16:57] promise and you know there's 88 hundred
[17:00] promises in the Bible from God eighty
[17:03] eight hundred promises from God and you
[17:05] know every single time God had kept his
[17:08] word eighty eight hundred times God kept
[17:11] his work the devil made nine promises in
[17:14] the Bible and nine times the devil lot
[17:18] it shows you that I'm on the Lord's side
[17:21] tonight because I'm taking the side of
[17:24] 8,800 promises tonight I want you to
[17:28] know that what I'm preaching to you is a
[17:30] God that cannot fail a God that cannot
[17:33] lie a God that will not back up on his
[17:35] word 8,800 promises in the ministry of
[17:40] william branham there was 80 380 visions
[17:44] that took place that you can hear on
[17:47] tape 80 380 visions that were told to
[17:51] you and I what is this it is telling us
[17:55] that the god of heavens is speaking to
[17:57] us people said well I don't I haven't
[18:01] heard from God in a while pick up your
[18:03] Bible
[18:04] pick up your Bible every time I don't
[18:07] care if it's one scripture you just read
[18:09] the word of Almighty God hallelujah we
[18:15] are in the land of promise and these
[18:18] promises are lifting us higher they're
[18:20] not degrading us they're not beating us
[18:23] down they're not telling us that we're
[18:26] not worthy but in the contrary they're
[18:28] telling us that we are worthy that he
[18:31] thought a whole lot of us he thought
[18:33] that we are a value there is the
[18:36] promises of God or lifting us higher
[18:38] they're not like Satan that degrade
[18:40] Assad's degrades us and beats us back
[18:43] and forth but the promises of God are
[18:45] you a man but as our scripture reading
[18:48] has told us that we belong in the land
[18:51] of triumph we don't belong in the land
[18:54] of defeat God know what you dealing and
[18:57] belonging in the land of sickness he
[19:01] know what you're living in the land of
[19:03] misery he what you're living in a good
[19:05] land
[19:06] he wants you living in a land that's
[19:08] overflowing it's flowing with milk and
[19:11] honey it sounds like a sticky place but
[19:14] you just stick right with this word it's
[19:16] a land that's flowing with the promises
[19:18] of God
[19:19] are you with me tonight you know what
[19:21] you're living in a land of sickness a
[19:24] land of home oh I learned the trouble he
[19:26] wants you living in a lay
[19:27] of health are you with me he wants you
[19:33] to be successful in your soul he wants
[19:35] you to be successful with your body in
[19:37] your mind when you go to work he wants
[19:39] you to be successful he wants you to be
[19:41] blessed when you come here
[19:43] bless when you go out blessed in your
[19:45] storehouses blessed in your basket
[19:47] he said he make you the head and not the
[19:49] tail he said he put you above and not
[19:51] beneath that's the dog we don't belong
[19:53] in the land of curses we belong in the
[19:56] land of blessings hallelujah we belong
[20:09] in the land of triumph the Bible says
[20:12] God Enki God has grown up with a shout
[20:15] and a shout of triumph you know that
[20:18] victory and trial for two different
[20:20] things
[20:20] you see God don't want you shouting with
[20:23] a voice of misery you know you have the
[20:28] allow you have the ability and the power
[20:29] to be able to speak to be able to speak
[20:32] things into existence and what you let
[20:35] it go out of your lips is what you will
[20:38] see made manifest I'm not talking about
[20:40] just power mind over matter and the
[20:43] power of speech but I'm talking about
[20:45] speaking God's work you know if you
[20:47] speak if you speak doubt you're gonna
[20:49] live in doubt if you speak fear you're
[20:51] gonna live in fear you know where you're
[20:54] speaking from you know in your own life
[20:57] where you're speaking from maybe you're
[20:59] a husband maybe your mother and you know
[21:01] how you're speaking to your children and
[21:03] sometimes maybe you maybe you corrected
[21:06] your children in the wrong atmosphere
[21:08] and the wrong spirit you corrected them
[21:10] in anger when you didn't do it in love
[21:12] and your voice was a voice of anger
[21:14] instead of a voice of love but I found
[21:17] that the voice of God is a corrective
[21:19] voice it's a voice that wants you to
[21:22] live right it's a voice that wants you
[21:24] to overcome it's a voice that will lift
[21:26] you higher and if you start speaking
[21:29] like the world that you came from
[21:32] I believe that we ought to shout I
[21:36] believe we are the dance but it should
[21:39] be a dance of triumph it should be a
[21:41] shout of triumph all right we're going
[21:46] to speak from a voice and that voice is
[21:49] going to come out as a voice of triumph
[21:51] but victory and triumph or two different
[21:54] things
[21:55] you see victory is when you win the
[21:58] battle but triumph is the celebration of
[22:02] victory
[22:02] you see triumph is win the roman army
[22:06] that would come in after they had went
[22:08] out and they'd fought the battle when
[22:11] they would come in after their victory
[22:12] the roman armies would come in and they
[22:15] would have a show of the spoils of the
[22:17] victory and they would parade around the
[22:20] city and they would display the glory in
[22:23] the power of their kingdom that they had
[22:26] won this battle they would go through
[22:28] there in a triumphal parade they would
[22:32] go down there knowing that they won the
[22:34] victory but victory is when you win the
[22:37] battle and triumph is a celebration it's
[22:41] a celebration
[22:43] I wanted to declare to you tonight that
[22:45] tonight is the night of celebration
[22:50] you've been defeated you've been in a
[22:53] battle take a look around you got some
[22:57] scars you've been in a barrel but
[22:58] tonight's the night of celebration
[23:02] tonight is not the night of defeat
[23:04] tonight is not the night where you still
[23:07] fight in the battle tonight is the night
[23:09] of triumph tonight is the night when you
[23:12] go through the city and you take the
[23:15] lives head and you drag it behind you

[28:15] that they knew that this land belong to
[28:18] them the promise belongs to them and
[28:21] they could look at through the eyes of
[28:23] faith and say that's where we belong
[28:25] when everybody else was saying that they
[28:28] wouldn't didn't want to go over there
[28:29] there was a Joshua that rose up and a
[28:31] Caleb that rose up that was a type of
[28:34] the true believers in Christ Jesus they
[28:37] rose up no matter the critics that tried
[28:39] to keep them off of the land you talk
[28:41] about a journey that they had to go
[28:43] through they had to go and they had to
[28:46] look at the red sea they had to go and
[28:48] look at the Jordan and God opened up the
[28:51] Red Sea and open up the Jordan because
[28:53] there was a land that belonged to them
[28:55] on the other side of it they had to go
[28:58] through the struggles they had to go
[29:00] through the critics they had to go
[29:02] through the obstacles of faced and for
[29:03] listings and Giants and critics but they
[29:06] were people that was destined to take
[29:08] the land the Bible says in numbers 33
[29:14] and 52 drive out the inhabitants and the
[29:19] Lord speaking to Moses in the plains of
[29:20] Moab by Jordan near Jericho saying
[29:23] speaking to the children of Israel and
[29:25] saying to them when you're passed over
[29:28] Jordan into the land of Canaan then you
[29:31] shall drive out all the inhabitants of
[29:33] the land you ain't got to go out and
[29:36] fight somebody else's battle but you got
[29:38] to fight your battles it's not about
[29:40] bowing out it's not about going out and
[29:43] fighting degrade the nominal Christians
[29:45] job and fighting their battles this is
[29:47] our battle this is where God destined us
[29:51] to you don't fight the battle out there
[29:53] you fight the battle in here then you
[29:56] should drive out the inhabitants of the
[29:58] land from before you and destroy all
[30:01] their pick
[30:02] destroy all their molten images and
[30:05] quite put down all their high places and
[30:09] ye shall dispossessed the inhabitants of
[30:13] the land and dwell therein for I have
[30:16] given you the land who's saying this
[30:22] Jehovah Edel him
[30:24] Almighty God is saying this that I've
[30:27] given you this land to possess it it was
[30:31] their job to go and kick them off it was
[30:34] their job because the land was
[30:36] rightfully ours
[30:37] it was rightfully theirs and there were
[30:40] squatters on the land but you can kick a
[30:43] squatter off and a squatter will come

[32:42] rights every promise in the book is mine
[32:46] we got to defend it we got a fight on
[32:51] our hands and we got to win the battle
[32:55] you know that we find that the scripture
[32:58] tells us that God has always had
[32:59] overcomers throughout every age in every
[33:02] age there's been over comers and God has
[33:04] always had one man that he could put his
[33:06] hand upon and he could say that's my man
[33:08] I can tell him what to do and he'll do
[33:10] exactly what I says he's doing there was
[33:13] a Moses there was an Abraham there was
[33:15] an Isaac and a Jacob and a Joseph that
[33:17] God could lay his hand upon then there
[33:19] rose up a Moses that he delay his head
[33:21] in the port and he would do exactly what
[33:23] God told him to do then there was a
[33:25] Joshua that rose up that God could place
[33:28] his hand upon him and said that's my
[33:30] servant I can tell him what to do and
[33:32] that's exactly what he'll do
[33:34] he won't waver what all the other people
[33:36] say around him and when Joshua came to
[33:39] the crisis of his ministry in Joshua
[33:42] chapter 10 when he had the enemy routed
[33:45] and he had him pushed back in a corner
[33:47] he needed a little bit more time to deal
[33:49] with his demons he needed a little bit
[33:53] more time so that he could destroy the
[33:55] enemy that was trying to keep them off
[33:57] of their belongings it was his job to go
[34:02] in there as a son of God to speak the
[34:06] things then right into existence and I
[34:08] want to say this to you tonight we want
[34:10] to say the right things

[34:18] about the save the Lord what about you
[34:21] and I tonight let's say the right thing
[34:23] tonight
[34:25] that's nothing but the truth and tell us
[34:30] why I was standing at this crisis where
[34:33] he needed a little bit more time to deal
[34:35] with the demons that were keeping him
[34:38] off of his land and he said son he
[34:42] didn't pray about it he didn't seek God
[34:45] about it but he said son stand still and
[34:49] moon thou hang there of the valley of a
[34:51] Jalan until I defeat my enemies tonight
[34:57] so night you need a little bit more time
[35:00] ask that the preacher preaches one more
[35:02] minute so that you defeats our enemies

[35:11] you the land I won't give you the land

[41:03] come to the house of God and you sleep

[41:18] sleeping food but I want to tell you
[41:19] that he has descended and he's had a
[41:22] shout and a voice and a trumpet at all

[41:39] it's the enemy's job to make you feel
[41:42] now make you feel unconfident it's the
[41:45] enemy's job to make you feel that you're
[41:47] not healthy it's the enemy's job to
[41:50] strip away your immune system it's the
[41:52] enemy's job to make you not strong
[41:54] it's the enemy's job to make you
[41:56] disbelieve in your weapon or warfare and
[41:59] tell you and make you not confident in
[42:01] your weapon or warfare when our weapons
[42:03] are not carnal but mighty and pulling
[42:08] down the strongholds of God we are to
[42:10] cast down imaginations and every high
[42:13] thing that exalts itself against the
[42:15] mind of God tonight cast it out cast out
[42:20] fear cast out doubt I wonder if there's
[42:24] anybody in here that knows what I'm
[42:26] talking about tonight that tonight's
[42:28] your night I want you to know that Jesus
[42:35] came the Bible said that Jesus came to
[42:37] destroy the works of the enemy and I
[42:40] want to tell you that Jesus is on your
[42:42] road like he was on the road to legions
[42:44] place I want you to know he's on your
[42:46] road and he's hunting for you he's
[42:49] heading for you tonight and he as good
[42:51] as his word he's coming
[42:55] hallelujah he's coming make ready
[43:02] Jesus is coming oh yeah tonight's the
[43:11] night you forgive me I already see the
[43:22] end but I'm trying to get you through
[43:27] the battle can I tell you something
[43:37] you're already seen in victory so while
[43:44] you're fighting right now I want you to
[43:47] fight with the mindset that you're a
[43:49] winner
[43:55] remember that the Bible said as we read
[43:57] in our scripture reading in Psalms 47
[44:00] and 9 that the shields of the earth
[44:02] belong unto the Lord that means all of
[44:06] the weapons the shield and the weapons
[44:08] of warfare belong to the Lord
[44:10] that means the rulers of this earth
[44:12] belonging to the Lord there's nothing
[44:15] that can touch you and say unless you
[44:17] see God's got control of everything he's
[44:20] in control of every thing and there's
[44:23] not one evil spirit that can come in
[44:25] here and block you that God don't have
[44:29] control over tonight there's spirits
[44:32] that are flying around in here tonight
[44:34] to get you to disbelief but the lord of
[44:38] the lord to you and those spirits is we
[44:41] rebuke that devil those spirits can
[44:45] touch one hair of your head until God
[44:47] gets permission gives them permission we
[44:51] should never live below our god-given
[44:52] River juice we should go in there and
[44:55] possess everything that all that better
[44:57] day that is rightfully ours
[44:58] we should possess the gate of sickness
[45:02] possess the gate of death possess the
[45:06] gate of backsliding in

[45:25] something way off in some kind of a
[45:27] millennium but that's one that the
[45:29] devil's pulled over you the Bible says
[45:32] now are we sons of God not we will be we
[45:35] are now in every redemptive blessing
[45:38] that the Lord Jesus died for is our
[45:40] personal property right now everything

[57:34] hook behind and the reason why he said
[57:37] we're not leaving a hook behind it's
[57:39] because it belonged to him you can hear
[57:43] the vision you can hear the prophet tell
[57:45] about the vision of the 42-inch caribou
[57:47] but there were certain things that were
[57:50] not maybe adding up in his own mind that
[57:52] he couldn't figure out well there's
[57:54] nobody here it ain't God there's nobody
[57:56] here that's got a green checkered shirt
[57:57] so it wasn't the time he thought in his
[58:00] mind but when he turned around and he
[58:02] looked at brother Eddie
[58:03] he said well brother Eddie I thought you
[58:05] didn't have a green checkered shirt he
[58:07] said brother branham I didn't think I
[58:09] did either but my wife packed this old
[58:12] shirt why did she pack that old shirt
[58:15] because it belonged in the vision Oh
[58:18] [Applause]
[58:20] hallelujah
[58:22] [Applause]
[58:25] it was to be there you're talking about
[58:29] anointing of God that God would so
[58:32] anoying a wife that which she wouldn't
[58:34] throw away assert that was a part of the
[58:36] vision I was seeing on the other side
[58:41] you can try to throw me away all you
[58:44] want to but I belong in the vision oh
[58:49] let the devil try to knock me down let
[58:52] him try to stop me I belong there
[58:55] I see what scene there our offspring was
[59:03] seen there they belong there let up come
[59:11] come
[59:24] hallelujah
[59:26] there's power that laziness truth
[59:30] tonight we're here we're giving witness
[59:33] we're giving witness to what the word
[59:35] can do there's a nose on your face
[59:39] because it belongs there there's an ear
[59:43] on your hair because it belongs there
[59:45] you're a part of this body but there was
[59:49] a sister one time that came to the
[59:51] Prophet that was holding a handkerchief
[59:52] over her nose you remember that story
[59:54] she was holding that handkerchief over
[59:56] nose he thought she said I thought she
[59:58] was weeping about something he said when
[1:00:01] she took the handkerchief away that nose
[1:00:03] was completely eaten off and the
[1:00:06] vibration said that it was cancer you
[1:00:09] see the demon was trying to rob
[1:00:12] something from the place that had belong
[1:00:15] that but the nose belongs back in that
[1:00:19] position that's where it was born to be
[1:00:22] a hurry with me and the Prophet bready
[1:00:25] and three months later three months
[1:00:28] later he seen a woman waving hadn't said
[1:00:30] do you remember me brother man do you
[1:00:33] remember me so no I don't really
[1:00:34] remember you remember how was the lady
[1:00:37] that had a nose that was eaten off but
[1:00:40] there was a new nose that was put in
[1:00:42] there and those belong there and that's
[1:00:46] what God gave her God didn't give her an
[1:00:53] ear to go on there or an eye to go there
[1:00:56] but a nose to go there because I nose
[1:00:58] belong there and God knows where the Sun
[1:01:02] air is supposed to be and he knows where
[1:01:04] the daughter is supposed to be and
[1:01:05] they'll be right there

[1:01:44] land you're annoying its oppressor
[1:01:46] battle and I'm getting ready to drive
[1:01:50] something right smack into the eye of
[1:01:53] the devil I've been looking at this
[1:01:59] thing for the last month and I'm coming
[1:02:03] against Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:02:06] there's power in the name of Jesus we
[1:02:10] know what it'll do to a table we know
[1:02:14] what the name of Jesus will do to a
[1:02:15] table we know what the name of Jesus
[1:02:18] would do to a dead baby we know what the
[1:02:20] name of Jesus would do to a dead womb
[1:02:23] come on somebody we know what the name
[1:02:26] of Jesus would do we realize that
[1:02:28] there's power in the name of Jesus that
[1:02:30] when we speak the name Jesus that
[1:02:33] something's got to shake David said in
[1:02:36] Psalms 1 8 10 and 10 that all nations
[1:02:38] can pass me about but in the name of the
[1:02:41] Lord when I destroy them it may look
[1:02:48] like you're surrounded but you're
[1:02:50] surrounded by him the Prophet would say
[1:02:55] that this age is the grandest of Ages
[1:02:57] because it's the ending of time and the
[1:02:59] blending of eternity it's the greatest
[1:03:01] sinful age it's more sin in this age
[1:03:03] than there's ever been and the powers of
[1:03:06] Satan as many times harder to fight

[1:03:53] me but he has to mind the one that I
[1:03:54] represent he has to mom the name in
[1:03:58] which I'm proclaiming and there's no
[1:04:01] other name under heaven and earth where
[1:04:03] men should be saved but by the name of
[1:04:05] Jesus Christ the Bible said that all men
[1:04:07] shall bow and they shall worship that
[1:04:10] name they serve I'll at the name of

[1:13:19] let me drop a few more things to you
[1:13:23] when I feel like a person is worthy of
[1:13:25] it when they're going for a job I'll
[1:13:27] tell them if I feel like they're worthy
[1:13:31] of it I'll tell them use my name use my
[1:13:37] name as a reference why because whether
[1:13:42] you won't believe it or not my name has
[1:13:44] power behind it I as a leader in this
[1:13:47] community when you go for a job and you
[1:13:50] put my name down a brother ons name it
[1:13:53] is associating you with a leader of the
[1:13:55] community and it is saying when I'm
[1:13:58] saying that I think what I'm saying is
[1:14:00] if I can tell you that you're worth
[1:14:03] to take my name and go to the job I'm
[1:14:05] saying that I believe that this person
[1:14:08] is worthy enough to get the job done
[1:14:10] that I believe that they should be hired
[1:14:12] out I don't give that out to everybody
[1:14:15] but there's certain people that I
[1:14:17] believe it's worthy of giving out my
[1:14:20] name too because they're worthy they're
[1:14:24] worthy they can get the job done I'm
[1:14:26] saying I'm saying that I believe that
[1:14:29] they'll be a good hire for you as the
[1:14:31] company I believe they'll be good for
[1:14:33] you I'm giving my name you see my name's
[1:14:36] backing you up whether you know this or
[1:14:40] not
[1:14:41] your name's got value my name's got
[1:14:45] value to it there's value to a name I
[1:14:50] was I was dealing with a place of
[1:14:53] business a couple years ago and it's
[1:14:55] trying to give me a runaround over over
[1:14:57] a certain business deal and I said hold
[1:14:59] up it was a manager didn't know the
[1:15:01] situation I said hold up one minute I
[1:15:03] don't believe you recognized Who I am
[1:15:06] you see because I send thousands and
[1:15:09] hundreds of thousands of dollars through
[1:15:11] your place of business and I don't
[1:15:13] believe you want me turning that down
[1:15:15] you see I tell them that you're a
[1:15:17] reputable place and a place of good
[1:15:19] business that people can get a good deal
[1:15:20] here but I don't believe that you want
[1:15:23] me telling the people that I influence
[1:15:25] that this place is a place of business
[1:15:27] that does bad business and they're
[1:15:29] shysters they're liars I don't believe
[1:15:31] you want me doing that you see he didn't
[1:15:33] realize who I was but once I brought him
[1:15:36] up to who I was he quickly changed his
[1:15:39] stance why because he wanted mine any
[1:15:42] one of your business you see Satan has
[1:15:46] to take a change of stance when you come
[1:15:49] against him in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:15:51] because there's value in the name that
[1:15:54] you speak in are you with me tonight
[1:15:57] you see God must have thought something
[1:16:00] of you that he would tell you that you
