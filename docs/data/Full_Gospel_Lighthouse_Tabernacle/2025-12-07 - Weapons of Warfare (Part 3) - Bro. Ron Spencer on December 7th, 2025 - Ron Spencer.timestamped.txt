[5:37] all [music] beaten and worn
[5:42] hardly
[5:43] a place
[5:45] [music] for a king to be born.
[5:50] He didn't choose some
[5:52] [singing and music] place special
[5:54] to reveal his majesty.
[5:59] So I know if I give him control, [music]
[6:04] he'll be born in me. Oh, let your
[6:08] [music] word
[6:11] be born [singing]
[6:13] in the manger of my heart. [singing]
[6:18] Oh, let it live in me. Oh, let [music]
[6:22] it start. [singing]
[6:26] Oh, live inside this house [music] of
[6:30] clay

[6:37] Oh, let [music] your word be born
[6:41] in the manger
[6:44] of [music] my heart. [singing]
[6:50] Well, [music and singing] outwardly I'm
[6:53] nothing.
[6:55] Not much [music and singing] to behold.
[7:00] Unlikely [music and singing]
[7:02] the place
[7:04] for his word to [music]
[7:07] [singing] unfold.
[7:09] What if I'll just shield
[7:11] [music and singing] this vessel
[7:13] and let him have his way
[7:19] from glory onto [music]
[7:21] glory?
[7:23] He'll change [singing] me day by day.
[7:27] Oh, let [music] your word

[9:03] Every single [music and singing]
[9:04] breath.
[9:09] I'll [music] bring you more [singing]
[9:11] than a song.
[9:14] For a song [music]
[9:16] it is said is [singing] not what you
[9:19] have required.
[9:25] [music] You [singing] search much deeper
[9:28] within
[9:30] through the way things appear. You're

[19:00] privilege this morning to enter into
[19:02] your house of thanksgiving and courts
[19:04] with praise upon our lips. David said,
[19:07] "I was glad when they said unto me, let
[19:09] us go to the house of the Lord." Father,
[19:11] we are gathered here today to worship
[19:13] you and only you, [music] Father. Lord,
[19:16] I pray that we would have such an
[19:17] intimate time with you, Father. Lord
[19:20] Jesus, kind of like the woman that day
[19:22] when she walked into the house and
[19:24] nobody else would worshiping you. But
[19:26] Lord, she saw fit, Lord Jesus, to lay
[19:29] everything aside and break that little
[19:31] alabaster box and to pour out her praise
[19:33] upon you, Father. Today, that's what we
[19:36] want to do is to come to a place, Lord
[19:38] Jesus, where you would be honored with
[19:40] our praise. Lord Jesus, WHERE YOU WOULD
[19:43] LOOK out and say, "Her sins are great,
[19:46] but they're all forgiven. FATHER, WE
[19:48] LOVE YOU so much. Your name is higher
[19:51] than our sin. Your name is greater than
[19:54] every president, every pope, AND EVERY
[19:57] PRIME MINISTER. YOUR NAME IS THE NAME,
[19:59] oh God, that we will worship forever and
[20:02] ever. And we love you, Lord Jesus. We
[20:06] love you so much.
[20:09] Come, Lord Jesus, today,

[20:16] you said those that love your appearing.
[20:20] [music]
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we're not just looking, but
[20:22] we love it.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; We're waiting for it. Lord God, we want
[20:26] your presence to just stay with us
[20:28] today. Come and bless Brother Ron as he
[20:31] will minister the word of life. Every
[20:33] song, every testimony, everything that
[20:35] is done in this building today, may you
[20:37] receive glory, Father. We love you with
[20:40] all of our heart in Jesus name. And the

[26:37] here together this morning, Lord. We've
[26:39] come because for one reason, we all need
[26:41] more of you. We've come because we need
[26:44] to hear from you, Lord. We need to be
[26:45] strengthened by your word and we need to
[26:47] be healed [music] and encouraged by your
[26:49] word. Lord Jesus, we just thank you,
[26:51] Father, Lord, for this opportunity.
[26:53] [music] We just pray that you bless each
[26:54] and every life, Lord. And as the word
[26:56] goes forth, may Lord, your spirit knows
[26:58] exactly how to go. And Lord, this the
[27:01] word of God is quick and powerful
[27:02] [music] and a discerner of the thoughts
[27:04] and intents of the heart, every single
[27:07] detail of our life and everything that
[27:08] we go through. Lord, may your word go
[27:11] down into our alleyways, Lord, in the
[27:12] places that need to be mended, Lord. And
[27:14] the places that need to be fixed. May
[27:16] your word come and bring about a mighty
[27:18] deliverance and a blessing, Lord.
[27:20] [music] May we truly be more like you,
[27:22] Father, when we leave than when we came
[27:23] in. Lord, the prophet tells us, Lord,
[27:26] that when we come to the house of God,
[27:27] we either leave better or worse than
[27:29] when [music] we came in. Lord, there's
[27:31] no middle ground. We It's impossible to
[27:33] leave the same [music] because your word
[27:35] will have an effect. And Lord, as the
[27:38] word goes out like a seed, Lord, may you
[27:39] just give us a heart to receive. May
[27:41] even as we worship you, Lord, may you
[27:43] help us to till the ground of our heart,
[27:45] Lord, and to break up the things of the
[27:47] past week and and any [music] complexes
[27:49] that we may have, may we break it all up
[27:52] that your Holy Spirit by the power of
[27:54] the spoken word can come into good
[27:56] ground [music] because, Father, we don't
[27:58] want to be forgetful hearers, Lord. That
[28:00] does us no good. But Lord, we want to
[28:02] bring forth fruit, Lord, and [music]
[28:03] produce the Holy Spirit to produce this
[28:06] message to a lost and dying world.
[28:08] [music] We love you now. We ask your
[28:10] blessings over every life again. Lord,
[28:12] we just pray over every need, Lord, that
[28:14] was read [music]
[28:15] that was read this morning. Lord, we
[28:16] just pray you have mercy on each and
[28:18] every need. We love you, Lord. We thank
[28:20] you, Father, for all your blessings.
[28:22] Thank you, Father, [music] for being so
[28:23] mindful of every situation that we have.
[28:26] Be with the sick and needy, Lord. just
[28:28] bless every life, Lord, underneath each
[28:30] hand that [music] was raised. Fill us a
[28:32] new with your Holy Spirit, Lord. We just
[28:34] pray that you bless Brother Ron this
[28:35] morning. Thank you [music] for bringing
[28:37] them through another week, Lord. We just
[28:38] pray that you strengthen them. May the
[28:40] great physicians step into the building,
[28:42] Lord, and encourage them [music] and
[28:43] strengthen them like never before. We
[28:45] love you now, Lord, and we thank you for
[28:47] all that you do. [music] We claim every
[28:49] promise that you have for us, and we
[28:50] receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:52] Christ. [music]
[28:53] We pray and ask these things. Amen.
[28:57] Amen. At this time, we'll take up the
[28:59] morning's offering. We have uh brother
[29:01] Marcus with us today. Want to invite him

[35:38] blood stains.
[35:41] I do not know
[35:44] Lord how others they could make it
[35:47] through

[35:50] that never [singing]
[35:51] go
[35:53] to Calvary
[35:55] as I do

[37:02] I claim those precious blood.
[37:10] [applause]
[37:53] It's a [music] blessing when I see the
[37:56] dark clouds parting. [music]
[38:00] When the rain is gone and [singing] sun
[38:03] is breaking through. [music]
[38:08] I anticipate when [music] life will just
[38:12] be normal.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[38:15] &gt;&gt; just to close my weery eyes [singing]
[38:18] and rest in you. [music]
[38:24] My heart can rest so easy when there's
[38:28] blue skies. [music and singing]
[38:31] When the wind is gone [music] and rain
[38:34] [singing]
[38:34] is not in sight.
[38:39] How [music and singing] I long to hang
[38:41] my sword above the mantle,
[38:47] [music] away from [singing] harm and
[38:50] distant from the fight.
[38:55] But I wouldn't [music and singing] know
[38:57] your peace without the hard times
[39:02] [music] or [singing] be thankful for
[39:05] relief without the pain.
[39:11] I wouldn't love [music] the [singing]
[39:12] light if it were not for darkness
[39:19] [music] or appreciate the sun without
[39:23] the rain.
[39:27] How [music] could I [singing] understand
[39:30] forgiveness without failure?
[39:35] Or feel the [music and singing] warmth
[39:37] of love without the bitter cold?
[39:42] [music]
[39:43] How could I hold your [singing] healing
[39:46] hands without affliction [music]
[39:52] and be blessed to see your [music]
[39:54] mercies all unfold?
[39:59] Sure, [music] it's a blessing
[40:02] to be safe, secure, and warm.
[40:09] But Lord, [singing] I want to [music]
[40:11] thank you for the storm.
[40:21] Imagine [music]
[40:22] [singing] as Peter sat in prison,
[40:28] he may have paced [singing] the floors
[40:31] with chains around his feet.
[40:37] And [music] in his mind, the devil
[40:39] taunted [singing]
[40:40] as he whispers,
[40:45] "The battle's [music] lost, and this is
[40:48] your defeat."
[40:53] [music] But then his mind went back to
[40:56] that night in the tempest.
[41:01] When the master [music and singing]
[41:03] spoke and winds and seas obey
[41:09] and he remembered [music]
[41:11] that storm calming all around him.
[41:16] [music]
[41:18] He could rest in that dark [singing]
[41:20] prison unafraid
[41:26] and say
[41:29] peace without the hard times
[41:35] or be [singing] thankful for [music]
[41:37] relief without the pain.
[41:43] I [music] wouldn't love the [singing]
[41:44] light if it were not for darkness
[41:51] or appreciate
[41:53] the [singing] sun without the rain.
[42:00] How could I understand forgiveness
[42:03] [music]
[42:03] without failure? [singing]
[42:08] Or feel the [music] warmth of love
[42:10] without the bitter cold?
[42:16] How could I hold your healing hands
[42:20] without affliction [music]
[42:25] and be blessed to see [singing] your
[42:27] mercies all unfold?
[42:32] Sure, [music] it's a blessing
[42:35] to be safe, secure, [singing] and warm.
[42:38] [music]
[42:41] Oh, but Lord, I want to thank you for
[42:46] the storm. [music]
[42:50] If my [singing] life were free of
[42:52] trials, Lord, I lose my view [music] of
[42:57] you.
[43:00] Their sweet trophies [singing] that
[43:02] remind me [music] of all you do.
[43:07] Sure, it's a blessing
[43:10] to be safe, [music]
[43:11] secure, and warm.
[43:16] Oh, but Lord, I want [singing] to thank
[43:19] [music] you for the storm.
[43:24] I'm still [music]
[43:26] safe,
[43:27] secure, and warm.
[43:33] Oh, but Lord, [singing]
[43:35] I want to thank you for the storm.
[43:38] [music]
[43:52] Let's stand this morning.

[53:32] realize that's one of my favorite
[53:34] scriptures that we're getting ready to
[53:35] read because it's a covenant with God.
[53:39] [clears throat]
[53:41] He that dwelleth in the secret place of
[53:44] the most high shall abide under the
[53:47] shadow of the almighty.
[53:49] I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge
[53:52] and my fortress, my God. In him will I
[53:57] trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from
[54:00] the the snare of the fowler and the from
[54:04] the noisome pestilence, and he shall
[54:06] cover thee with his feathers, and under
[54:09] his wings shalt thou trust. His truth
[54:12] shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou
[54:15] shalt not be afraid, for the terror by
[54:16] night, and the arrow that flyth by day,
[54:19] nor the pestilence that walketh in the
[54:21] darkness, nor the destruction that
[54:23] wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall
[54:26] foul at thy side, and 10,000 at thy
[54:30] right hand, but it shall not come nigh
[54:32] thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou
[54:35] behold and see the reward of the wicked
[54:39] because thou hast made the Lord which is
[54:42] my refuge even the most high thy
[54:45] habitation.
[54:47] Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10.
[54:52] Finally, my brethren, be strong in the
[54:54] Lord and in the power of his might, and
[54:58] put on the whole armor of God, that you
[55:00] may be able to stand against the ws of
[55:03] the devil. For we wrestle not against
[55:06] flesh and blood, but against
[55:07] principalities, and against powers, and
[55:10] against the rulers of the darkness of
[55:12] this world,
[55:14] against the spiritual wickedness in high
[55:16] places. Wherefore take unto you the
[55:19] whole armor of God that you may be able
[55:21] to withstand in the evil day and having
[55:24] done all to stand.
[55:28] Stand therefore having your loins gird
[55:31] about with the truth and having on the
[55:33] breastplate of righteousness. May God
[55:36] bless the reading of his word. You can
[55:38] be seated today.
[55:45] Brother Brandman said, "All powers in
[55:47] heaven and earth is given into my hand.
[55:50] Go and I'll go with you.
[55:54] Whatsoever you bind on earth,
[55:58] I'll bind in heaven." That's right.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you loose on earth, I'll
[56:03] loose in heaven.
[56:05] Oh, if the great holy church
[56:09] only realized its power to do these
[56:12] things. It's not just words.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; It's not just words. It's action.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brams, let me just share this
[56:23] quote with you. You're here for a
[56:26] purpose.
[56:28] You're here to destroy the works of the
[56:30] devil.
[56:32] Because you have a part of that to do.
[56:36] Jesus came to destroy the works of the
[56:38] devil. Then your purpose as his
[56:41] offsprings, his sons and daughters, must
[56:45] have the same ambition.
[56:47] I'm going to destroy the works of the
[56:51] devil.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Let's quote that together. I'm going to
[56:55] destroy the works of the devil.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; God instructed brother Brandham and and
[57:02] as is one of the most powerful quotes
[57:04] that he gives talking about that we're
[57:06] an invincible army. And brother Brandham
[57:08] talks about this bride of Jesus Christ
[57:10] that she's an invincible army. Then
[57:13] another place he says she knows what he
[57:17] wants done with the word.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:24] This is our day. That's right.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; We didn't come in Luther's day or in
[57:29] Wesley's day or or another day.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; This is your day.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; You showed up at the right time.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You're anointed to overcome this day.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Ephesians or Revelations chapter 3 says
[57:45] to us that to him that overcomemeth,
[57:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to survive.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to get by.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; I'm not here just to be a church member.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; I want to be identified as an overcomer.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Overcoming means that you're going to
[58:04] wrestle. You're going to have to fight.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; But there's no quit in the bride of
[58:10] Jesus Christ.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; There's nowhere that we surrender and
[58:14] get off and take the exit ramp. We're
[58:18] going to overcome. Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is our moment.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; This is our moment.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; We read of Noah and Abraham and Moses
[58:31] and we read of all the ladies of the
[58:34] Bible and they lived in their day. They
[58:36] overcame in their day. They had
[58:38] struggles in their day. But this is your
[58:40] day.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; You can mark it on your your
[58:45] refrigerator. This is my day. That's
[58:47] right.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; I was sick here. I was born. I was
[58:51] pre-planned to live in this day. And
[58:53] here I am.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody else is going to do it for you.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I just bring it to this just to get
[59:05] a thought so you'll know where I'm at.
[59:07] We're coming toward the end of December.
[59:10] At the end of December, we have ate like
[59:13] hogs.
[59:18] We have bellied up to table after table
[59:21] and we've ate ham, chicken, turkey,
[59:24] oysters,
[59:26] mashed potatoes.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to get you ready to eat
[59:32] here. Sweet potatoes with all the
[59:35] fixings on them, rolls that big,
[59:40] and your pants don't fit no more.
[59:45] your dress is just a little bit tighter
[59:47] than it was uh six weeks ago. And you
[59:51] begin to make a promise. Come January,
[59:54] I'm going on a diet. I'm going to
[59:57] exercise. I'm going to make a
[59:59] commitment. I'm going to dedicate
[1:00:02] myself. Two weeks into January, gone.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; How you know that, Brother Ron? Well,
[1:00:12] you see all these exercise places that
[1:00:16] and the month that their membership goes
[1:00:20] up is January.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The month that their membership goes
[1:00:26] down is
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; January.
[1:00:34] If you're going to be committed, you got
[1:00:35] to be committed.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm with you. I'm with
[1:00:42] you. Now, I want you to understand if
[1:00:45] this is our day and this is our moment
[1:00:48] and we're in the vision.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; AND NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IT FOR US.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; This is a personal rapture universal
[1:00:58] around the world.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to overcome for us.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to step in. We'll pray
[1:01:05] for each other. We are a team. Amen.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; We're going to set at the marriage
[1:01:11] supper a table that's unbelievably long.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; I have a chair.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; I have a chair.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; I have a name plate on my chair. That's
[1:01:24] where I'm GOING TO SIT. YOU CAN'T TAKE
[1:01:26] MY PLACE.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; I can't take your place.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; We hear the prophets say, "Billy Graham
[1:01:34] can't TAKE YOUR PLACE. I can't take your
[1:01:36] place.
[1:01:38] Are you with me now?
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Nobody
[1:01:44] can take your place.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; God didn't leave you alone to do that,
[1:01:51] but he armed you for battle in this day.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; This the the scripture says Jesus and
[1:02:00] Jesus answering and said unto them, this
[1:02:04] is real simple.
[1:02:06] Have faith in God
[1:02:11] as believers. That's where we start.
[1:02:14] Mark 11 and verse 22. For verily I say
[1:02:18] unto you, that whatsoever
[1:02:22] whosoever
[1:02:23] shall say unto this mountain, be thou
[1:02:25] removed, and and be thou cast into the
[1:02:28] sea,
[1:02:30] and shall not doubt in HIS HEART, BUT
[1:02:33] SHALL BELIEVE THAT THOSE things which he
[1:02:36] saith shall come to pass. He shall have
[1:02:41] whatsoever he saith. [snorts]
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Speak it, believe it.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I say unto you that
[1:02:52] whatsoever you desire when you pray,
[1:02:56] believe that ye receive them,
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; and you shall have them.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, LORD.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU STAND PRAYING,
[1:03:07] FORGIVE.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; And if you have ought against any, that
[1:03:12] your father also, that your father also
[1:03:14] which is in heaven may forgive you your
[1:03:19] trespasses.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; They did me wrong, brother Ron. Forgive
[1:03:22] them.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Forgive them and move on.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Don't carry the burden. How How hard is
[1:03:30] that to do, FATHER?
[1:03:33] HELP ME TO FORGIVE THEM
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; that have reviled AGAINST ME. HELP ME TO
[1:03:39] FORGIVE them that have TALKED AGAINST
[1:03:40] ME. HELP ME TO FORGIVE THEM AND I LAY IT
[1:03:43] AT YOUR FEET.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Don't pick it up and carry it anymore.
[1:03:48] Are you with me now? You're not strong
[1:03:50] enough to carry all those burdens. Amen.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; But if you forgive not, neither will
[1:03:57] your father which is in heaven forgive
[1:04:00] you your trespasses.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Simply put, this ain't great deep
[1:04:07] thought here. If you don't forgive
[1:04:09] others,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; God won't forgive you.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; And whether you're looking in the mirror
[1:04:15] or not, you are not perfect.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; So, we need Are you with me?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; nothing.
[1:04:26] He said, notice it is something that you
[1:04:30] possess.
[1:04:32] Faith is it is something that you
[1:04:35] possess. Faith is not imagination.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; If you really have it, it's as real
[1:04:46] as any other thing could be.
[1:04:52] You ever heard about those guys that uh
[1:04:56] went to sell the king special robes?
[1:05:02] And they were con artist.
[1:05:05] They came to the king and they be to
[1:05:07] talk to him. The kind of clothes that we
[1:05:09] make, you've got to be such a have a
[1:05:11] special insight and you got to have a
[1:05:14] you've got to have a revelation of how
[1:05:17] great these clothes are.
[1:05:20] And so, you know, they begin to pull
[1:05:22] them out and show them to the king.
[1:05:24] Well, they were invisible.
[1:05:29] And the king didn't want to feel like he
[1:05:31] was ignorant or to feel like that uh,
[1:05:35] you know, he didn't have special
[1:05:36] insight. So, he began to try him on.
[1:05:39] [laughter]
[1:05:43] And so, THESE GUYS SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:05:46] If you really want to see how great your
[1:05:47] kingdom is, tell them that they've got
[1:05:50] special insight. And if they and they've
[1:05:53] got a great revelation of how great you
[1:05:56] are as a king,
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; you ought to have a parade
[1:06:01] and wear your special clothes.
[1:06:04] Well, you know, everybody was ooing and
[1:06:06] aing after speech and and he's going
[1:06:08] down through there and everybody was,
[1:06:10] you know, talking about how great it
[1:06:11] was. little girl standing about this
[1:06:13] tall
[1:06:16] and she said, "Mommy,
[1:06:19] why is the king in his underwear?"
[1:06:25] YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES RELIGION, YOU CAN
[1:06:27] SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; THIS ain't real,
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; but this is.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Don't give ME A BUNCH OF JUNK.
[1:06:38] I WANT THAT WHICH WILL CLOTHE ME,
[1:06:42] [applause]
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that will live on Monday morning like it
[1:06:47] lives on Sunday.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; And when I speak it, it will believe it
[1:06:52] and it's real.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:57] [snorts]
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says talks about contest.
[1:07:05] He said a contest is a test of strength.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have a enemy that is a
[1:07:17] is quite an enemy that's not like a
[1:07:19] paper tiger but he roars as a lion. Fear
[1:07:24] is real. It's mentioned 600 times in the
[1:07:27] Bible. He comes to to kill, to steal,
[1:07:31] and destroy. And if he does all that,
[1:07:34] there's no need in negotiating with him.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; He's not the kind of an enemy that you
[1:07:40] negotiate with and and go to Geneva,
[1:07:42] Switzerland, and and and sign some
[1:07:45] papers for him to back off.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; It's kind of like Russia. Yesterday they
[1:07:50] were they were talking peace
[1:07:54] and last night they had the worst attack
[1:07:57] that you could have.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; That's kind of like the enemy.
[1:08:03] If you rub the cat the right way, it'll
[1:08:06] be settled for a little while. But
[1:08:08] remember that boole booger will bite you
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; and it'll scratch you.
[1:08:14] [applause]
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; And the enemy wants TO KILL TO STEAL and
[1:08:18] destroy.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; AND LISTEN, YOUR FAMILY IS WORTH
[1:08:23] FIGHTING FOR.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to when YOU LOOK OVER AT
[1:08:29] YOUR CHILDREN, THEY'RE WORTH FIGHTING
[1:08:31] FOR.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; YOUR WIFE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Your husband as well, sisters, you can
[1:08:40] go ahead and say amen right there.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; I I found it interesting yesterday
[1:08:47] and and brother Andrew's sermon, which
[1:08:49] was incredible.
[1:08:51] Brother Brandon will come and and he
[1:08:54] says I he comes to the pullpit five
[1:08:56] different times and he says I want to
[1:09:00] give God a fair trial.
[1:09:04] Five different times, brother Brandham
[1:09:05] preaches a trial. And so he starts out
[1:09:09] in Mark chapter 16, the sign shall
[1:09:13] follow them that believe. and he wants
[1:09:15] to give God a trial,
[1:09:18] a fair trial that he's proving his word.
[1:09:23] God is is not like a a fickle man.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; God will always back his word.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; If he says anything, he'll back it up.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAYS A COUPLE DIFFERENT things
[1:09:40] and I'll just bring it to you. the doubt
[1:09:42] of this age. They don't believe he's
[1:09:44] real.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's a lot of belief in the
[1:09:48] world that Jesus never came.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Think about that. They don't really
[1:09:54] realize that he's real. They they don't
[1:09:56] even want to want to believe is real or
[1:09:58] they want a Jesus of their own
[1:10:00] imagination.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:06] WHAT PART OF THE SCRIPTURES are
[1:10:08] inspired?
[1:10:09] Come on.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; What part is man?
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Now, we know a lot of people doubt
[1:10:18] Brother Brandham and they want to
[1:10:19] contest Brother Brandham and all
[1:10:21] different kinds of things, but you know,
[1:10:22] they waited 50 years to contest him.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Listen, whether you
[1:10:29] want to realize, his body's probably
[1:10:30] already back to dust now.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; But the message went forth
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and it did what it said it would do. It
[1:10:39] gathered a bride all over the world in
[1:10:41] every nation.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Well, let me let me just stop here just
[1:10:50] for a moment. Uh uh
[1:10:53] those that want to contest, Brother
[1:10:55] Brandham,
[1:10:57] did a light show up at your birth?
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Did a dove fly in the window at your
[1:11:06] birth?
[1:11:07] Come on.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Is does your name have seven letters all
[1:11:12] through it?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Let me go to another one. Is there seven
[1:11:21] mountains
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; that spell out your name?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:29] Can you stand backwards on a pull pit
[1:11:32] and call people out over and over again
[1:11:34] and maybe tell ONE PERSON 22 DIFFERENT
[1:11:36] THINGS?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; And be totally accurate.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE DISCREDITING
[1:11:44] a prophet, remember you're pointing a
[1:11:46] finger, but there's four pointing back
[1:11:48] to you.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; When you're putting him under a
[1:11:51] microscope, are you with me now?
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THE SAME MICROSCOPE WILL COME
[1:11:56] BACK ON YOU.
[1:12:03] SO, so let's just let's just go.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; So, WE'LL GIVE MR. UNBELIEVER. HOW MANY
[1:12:10] ever has to fight with him?
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We'll give Mr. Skeptic. He's going to
[1:12:16] come. And Mr. Impatient.
[1:12:20] All of us has had to fight these
[1:12:22] boogers.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; I don't know if in the Webster or not.
[1:12:27] might mean something different than
[1:12:36] the word will always stand the test.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; The word will always stand to test. Your
[1:12:44] feelings won't.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Your Timex watch won't.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; When God MAKES A PROMISE, HE'S NOT
[1:12:53] necessarily saying when.
[1:12:57] Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; He's not saying when. When you pray,
[1:13:02] IT MAY TAKE 25 years for it to come to
[1:13:05] pass.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; But you just got to believe it to.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; And you got to watch IT TAKE PLACE CUZ
[1:13:13] YOU CAN'T PRODUCE IT IN THE first place.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Now, sometimes we get impatient.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; We get impatient.
[1:13:26] So,
[1:13:28] here comes
[1:13:30] Mr. Barhop
[1:13:32] into the church. He's got all the world
[1:13:35] hanging on him. Or
[1:13:38] Mrs. Prissy Pants
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; and she's got all the world hanging on
[1:13:45] her AND WE GET IMPATIENT.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; You know, we get impatient for her to
[1:13:51] look like Christ or him to act LIKE
[1:13:53] CHRIST.
[1:13:54] BUT YOU JUST LET THE WORD do the test.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You just let it wash and wash
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; and wash.
[1:14:04] [applause and cheering]
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; One of the last conversations that my
[1:14:13] mother and I had, literally the second
[1:14:18] to the last conversation that we had,
[1:14:21] they had had a a Mr. Legalist preach for
[1:14:24] them.
[1:14:28] Boy, it upset her
[1:14:31] because that Mr. Legalist was talking
[1:14:33] about her her grandsons.
[1:14:39] And you know, her grandsons wasn't
[1:14:41] saved. They were born raised in church.
[1:14:46] And Mr. Legalist was just burning hides.
[1:14:49] My mom's temperature was going woo.
[1:14:54] [snorts]
[1:14:55] And so it was my job now to talk to my
[1:14:57] mom.
[1:15:00] [laughter] Are you with me? You feel me
[1:15:03] now? You feel me now, don't you?
[1:15:06] I got a
[1:15:09] probably wouldn't be a proper word to
[1:15:11] say hot mom,
[1:15:15] [laughter]
[1:15:17] but brother Ray, her temperature was
[1:15:19] balling, baby.
[1:15:22] She was upset.
[1:15:25] And so I told her, I I I just said I
[1:15:29] literally said, "God, help me."
[1:15:35] I wanted to put it in a way that she
[1:15:37] would understand it. And she was going
[1:15:40] on, man. She if she could have had the
[1:15:42] spoken word, that guy would have been
[1:15:44] toast.
[1:15:47] Hey, listen. She She'd listened to
[1:15:48] sermons since she was a kid. And now
[1:15:51] listen, this one's upsetting her. It
[1:15:53] would be the last sermon my mom listened
[1:15:55] to. Think about that.
[1:16:00] I've I've really gave that a lot of
[1:16:02] thought.
[1:16:06] cuz she would have a heart attack on
[1:16:08] Friday
[1:16:09] and that was a Wednesday night.
[1:16:12] And I said, "Mom," I said, "What some
[1:16:15] people don't realize is the principle of
[1:16:18] fishing."
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; You can't clean a fish
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; until you catch it.
[1:16:36] Did you get it? Tell your neighbor you
[1:16:38] can't clean a fish.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; How many fish stories have we heard? He
[1:16:47] that big.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Woo. He was big. How many deer stories?
[1:16:53] It's deer season now. How many deer
[1:16:55] stories that we hear there's called
[1:16:58] ground shrinkage?
[1:17:01] [laughter]
[1:17:06] He was like that. He had horns that
[1:17:08] tall,
[1:17:10] BUT WHEN I WALKED UP TO HIM, he was
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; You had him hanging on the wall,
[1:17:20] maybe turned right or left, and then you
[1:17:22] walked up to him and said, "Well, I
[1:17:24] believe I'll give a skull mount.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; It's not invisible.
[1:17:39] It's not manufactured.
[1:17:41] It's not based on your feelings.
[1:17:45] But the word of God is infallible.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; And it washes us over time.
[1:17:54] God don't send you through a pipe.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:59] He doesn't mechanize and sending you
[1:18:01] through a pipe and then you're an
[1:18:03] overcomer.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T FORCE NOTHING on you.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you want your kids to be
[1:18:12] perfect. It's in my notes. YOU WANT YOUR
[1:18:14] KIDS TO be perfect.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; WELL, SWEETHEART, YOU WASN'T PERFECT.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; You wasn't perfect. Are you with me now?
[1:18:26] So, THEY'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH THE SAME
[1:18:28] process that you went through.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They got to grow.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; They think like a 10 a 10 year old.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And you're lucky enough to live to 40.
[1:18:45] And listen, there you are. YOU'RE YOU'RE
[1:18:47] JUDGING THEM.
[1:18:56] Brother Ron, I don't know if I'll ever
[1:18:57] grasp everything about the message.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You know, that's not what it's about.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; It's about do you believe
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; it's not whether you understand it or
[1:19:11] not and be able to be able to
[1:19:16] to talk about the seals and the trumpets
[1:19:19] and the thunders and
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; are you with me?
[1:19:23] Are you with me? And to be able to talk
[1:19:25] about all you have to do is believe.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; It's good to have the knowledge of all
[1:19:33] those things, but do you believe it?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Oh, brother Ron, I know
[1:19:41] everything about it. Okay. Write a book
[1:19:43] on
[1:19:49] [snorts] understanding women.
[1:19:54] believe I'll open my drink on that one.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to say anymore.
[1:20:07] I want to give you a couple examples
[1:20:09] here.
[1:20:16] Noah was a farmer,
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; not an engineer. Right?
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; He definitely was not a boat builder,
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; He was a farmer.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; But God positioned him on the earth at
[1:20:27] the right time
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; at the right place
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; and gave him a revelation that I'M GOING
[1:20:35] TO DESTROY THE EARTH.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to destroy the earth and I'm
[1:20:42] going to do it with water.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to rain,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; right? I'm going to flood the earth and
[1:20:49] EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT in the ark is
[1:20:52] going to perish.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; God didn't give that to a half a million
[1:20:58] people.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; One man
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; and he be to preach that AND HE PREACHED
[1:21:07] IT WITH ALL OF HIS HEART CUZ REMEMBER HE
[1:21:10] REALIZES THAT IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE ARK
[1:21:13] YOU DIE.
[1:21:15] THAT'S WHY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS SO
[1:21:17] IMPORTANT.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; IT IS SO IMPORTANT.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THE MESSAGE, THERE'S no
[1:21:24] rapture.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; There is redemption, BUT THERE'S NO
[1:21:29] RAPTURE.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; There's no escaping the things that are
[1:21:34] coming on the earth.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; The tribulation is coming on the earth.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Well, brother Ron, I can make it through
[1:21:40] the tribulation.
[1:21:43] Brother Brandham explains a tribulation
[1:21:45] period
[1:21:48] alongside the Holocaust,
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; And he said, "The Holocaust will be like
[1:21:53] a Sunday afternoon picnic."
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Folks, let me just say this to you. This
[1:22:00] world's not worth staying here for.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Be sincere. Be
[1:22:11] dedicated. be committed.
[1:22:14] [snorts]
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; They begin to ask Noah questions.
[1:22:21] Where's the rain coming from?
[1:22:27] Where's it coming from? It's never
[1:22:29] rained.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; HOW ARE YOU A PROPHET?
[1:22:34] Are you the only holy man on the earth?
[1:22:39] Are you the only man that can speak to
[1:22:41] God?
[1:22:43] But Noah knew.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Noah knew.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; You can hear the passion in brother
[1:22:51] Brandham's voice in a particular one
[1:22:54] sermon. Souls now in prison.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And you can hear that after this service
[1:23:02] is coming to an end. He thought that was
[1:23:04] going to be the end.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. another sermon called
[1:23:07] sers, what is the time?
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; And he's asking the people, where are we
[1:23:14] at?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; What junction are we in?
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; You can hear the prophet's voice.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Noah be to build an ark
[1:23:30] in the ark. begin to build the ark to
[1:23:32] where that it's going to take more than
[1:23:34] a couple days.
[1:23:36] Here's where time comes in. Here's where
[1:23:38] Mr. impatient and Mr. Skeptic and Mr.
[1:23:41] Unbeliever will begin to fight Noah.
[1:23:43] That's
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And in the fighting of Noah,
[1:23:47] you know, it ain't rained all this time.
[1:23:50] You've been preaching this message 120
[1:23:52] years, right?
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham's been dead almost 60.
[1:24:02] Whenever a skeptic tells you that, ask
[1:24:05] him about the vision in 1933 and cars
[1:24:09] going down the road without a driver.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; He never thought, hey, listen, listen. I
[1:24:18] I I knew what brother Ram said, but now
[1:24:20] to watch a car come down the road with
[1:24:22] no driver,
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; we saw one the other day and woo, I
[1:24:27] don't know if I want to ride in it.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; But we're here.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; We're here.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; We have arrived. Friend of mine told me
[1:24:41] told me the other day was in a certain
[1:24:42] city. Called for an Uber driver and the
[1:24:45] Uber car showed up. No driver. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; We're here.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; You don't have to argue about the
[1:24:53] vision. It's happened.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; We have a United States Pope.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He's uniting the world together.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; He's doing THINGS THAT NO OTHER POPE HAS
[1:25:07] DONE.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; SO, let's just come back just for A
[1:25:10] MOMENT. IF HE'S TAKING HIS PLACE,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I MUST TAKE MY PLACE.
[1:25:18] [applause]
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO TAKE MY PLACE.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, Romans chapter 8 and VERSE 31, WHAT
[1:25:27] SHALL WE THEN SAY TO THESE THINGS?
[1:25:30] IF GOD BE FOR US,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; let's stand STRONG NOW. IF GOD BE FOR
[1:25:38] US,
[1:25:40] who can be against us?
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in the message we we
[1:25:46] say, Brother Brandham, but God's
[1:25:48] speaking through the voice.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; HE CALLS US THE FINAL VOICE,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; To the final age.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; SAME VOICE CALLS US AN invincible army.
[1:26:02] Then I want to ask you now, who gathered
[1:26:06] us together?
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Who then gathered us together?
[1:26:15] One of our favorite preachers is brother
[1:26:17] Tim Puit
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; from H Louisiana.
[1:26:23] The fellow that preached for us last
[1:26:24] week and did a phenomenal job, Brother
[1:26:27] Kelly from Saskatoon, Canada.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] which some of you would have to go and
[1:26:33] look on the look on the maps to find
[1:26:35] that spot.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Without this message,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; we would have never met.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE saying five hours, four hours,
[1:26:53] two hours.
[1:26:56] Who gathered us?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Who did this? We didn't we DIDN'T GO TO
[1:27:02] SOME APP SOMEWHERE or another and say we
[1:27:04] want a certain group of people and
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] BROUGHT US TOGETHER.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; GOD DID THIS.
[1:27:16] [applause]
[1:27:24] Are you with me?
[1:27:27] How important is our time? Well, let me
[1:27:29] just say this to you. We are only mortal
[1:27:32] once.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Whether you live to be 90 years old, 20
[1:27:38] years old,
[1:27:41] or 10 years old,
[1:27:44] it's time. It evaporates.
[1:27:48] It's like the vapor
[1:27:50] over top of the off over top of a
[1:27:53] teapot. It's there just for a few
[1:27:56] moments and it's gone.
[1:27:59] Are you with me? Important people that
[1:28:02] have done important things, they'll be
[1:28:04] known maybe for hundreds of years.
[1:28:08] But when we're talking about eternity,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; when we sat down, as the prophet told us
[1:28:14] said, we'll sit down in that rose garden
[1:28:17] 500 years.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Now, for our minds to comprehend that,
[1:28:22] we sat down in a rose garden 500 years.
[1:28:27] That's Christopher Columbus stuff.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR 500 YEARS.
[1:28:39] Eternity
[1:28:41] is beyond our fathoming of our thoughts.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:58] When we come to our our life cycle
[1:29:02] and to overcome failure is not an
[1:29:05] option.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; It's not an option.
[1:29:13] Quitting
[1:29:15] is not an option.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Have a seat of God inside of you.
[1:29:23] You can't quit.
[1:29:26] You can't give up.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; The prophet called this a golden age.
[1:29:40] Yet, it's an age unfit to live in.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; If you looked at the news this morning,
[1:29:49] it will depress you. Right.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; But at the same time, you were getting
[1:29:55] ready for church and you were so
[1:29:57] excited.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS GOD GOING TO SPEAK TO US TODAY?
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; SO, it's such AN AGE THAT IT'S UNFIT TO
[1:30:06] LIVE IN. YET, GOD BUILT YOU
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; to live in two worlds at the same time.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; You live in a heavenly realm and a Sodom
[1:30:17] Gomorrah realm.
[1:30:19] And really, whoever's suppressing it
[1:30:22] don't affect you no way.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE GET THEIR SELF SO upset
[1:30:32] and so POLITICALLY TORE ALL TO PIECES
[1:30:35] OVER WHO'S the president.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when it affects you. when
[1:30:44] they raise your taxes.
[1:30:47] [snorts]
[1:30:48] And I'll tell you another time it'll
[1:30:50] affect you. When they send you money,
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; we've overpaid you.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; It's a human government.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; They don't have the answers,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; but right here does.
[1:31:08] [applause]
[1:31:18] Well, brother Ron, I trust in my job.
[1:31:22] Your job might go away overnight.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes people trust in their houses
[1:31:30] and their houses are everything and a
[1:31:32] tornado in three seconds.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yesterday, Sister Connie
[1:31:39] was baking whatever cookies,
[1:31:43] asparagus. That stuff's worth being
[1:31:46] burned up.
[1:31:59] Every brother in this building ought TO
[1:32:01] BE SAYING, "AMEN, BROTHER ROY."
[1:32:07] And all of a sudden, our stove was on
[1:32:09] fire. I'm talking about flames, baby.
[1:32:13] I go in and grab mitts and we get it
[1:32:16] out. I see the asparagus.
[1:32:24] Life can change in a few seconds.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; A heart attack can change.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; A stroke can change you.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE STRONG AND HEALTHY AT THIS VERY
[1:32:36] MOMENT, but that heart is only JUST
[1:32:39] BEATING ONE TICK at a time. HOW CLOSE
[1:32:42] ARE WE TO ETERNITY?
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I'm strong. Brother
[1:32:49] Ron, let let A BLOOD CLOT GO THROUGH
[1:32:52] YOUR HEART and go to your brain.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Left side, right side, mechanical
[1:32:58] functions all of a sudden's gone.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:04] Yes, sir.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Sister Terry, your mom was in the in the
[1:33:08] rehab center for nine years, I believe.
[1:33:11] I may be. I believe it was about nine
[1:33:14] years.
[1:33:16] Listen, she was standing here. Brother
[1:33:19] Billy Andrews is preaching. Brother
[1:33:21] Roger, Brother Rogers being prayed for.
[1:33:24] Sister Sister Hoover is being prayed
[1:33:26] for. Listen, Brother Roger had a heart
[1:33:29] attack that night. Sister Hoover would
[1:33:31] have a stroke in a few days. She laid in
[1:33:34] a in a home for eight, nine years,
[1:33:40] having to be taken care of. So, while
[1:33:43] you're healthy,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. LET ME STRESS THIS POINT. WHILE
[1:33:48] YOU'RE FUNCTIONABLE,
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; do something.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; SERVE THE PURPOSE OF GOD.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT'S IMPORTANT? ETERNAL LIFE is
[1:34:03] important.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:34:12] I said this several years ago and it
[1:34:15] means more to me than today. Even today,
[1:34:18] courage is not having the strength to go
[1:34:20] on.
[1:34:22] It is going on when you don't have the
[1:34:25] strength.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; The scripture is very important to us.
[1:34:32] Behold, I have created the smith that
[1:34:34] bloweth the coals into fire and bringeth
[1:34:36] forth an instrument for his work. I have
[1:34:39] created the waster to destroy. And then
[1:34:42] the next scripture says, no weapon
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; that is formed against thee shall
[1:34:48] prosper,
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; and every tongue that shall rise against
[1:34:51] thee in the JUDGMENT THOU SHALT CONDEMN.
[1:34:55] RIGHT?
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE heritage of the servants of
[1:34:58] the Lord,
[1:35:00] and their righteousness
[1:35:02] is of me, saith the Lord.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:35:08] Just give you a few notes here. God's
[1:35:11] words are eternal.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Men's words are temporary.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. God's words is eternal.
[1:35:25] Men's words are temporary.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; His thoughts to give us weapons for our
[1:35:33] war warfare IS ETERNAL. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? WHEN GOD GAVE US THE
[1:35:40] THE the weapons that we needed to fight,
[1:35:44] whether it was in Noah's day or
[1:35:46] Abraham's day, brother Brandham's day,
[1:35:48] in our day, it's the same. It's the word
[1:35:52] of God.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; And the word of God will defeat Satan
[1:35:56] anywhere,
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; any place, and at any time. Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; The word of GOD WILL DEFEAT SATAN
[1:36:05] ANYWHERE,
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; any place,
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; at any time.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; We are commissioned.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; We are commissioned as ambassadors on
[1:36:22] the earth
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; to defeat the devil.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Your authority is in the name of Jesus
[1:36:30] Christ. Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; There's no authority any greater. There
[1:36:35] is no there is no name that's any
[1:36:38] greater.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever you shall bind on earth, I'll
[1:36:42] bind in heaven. Whatsoever you shall
[1:36:44] loose on earth, I'll loose it in heaven.
[1:36:46] Brother Ron, I just feel so weak. The
[1:36:49] prophet says, "When the weakest of
[1:36:50] Christians go on their knees, the
[1:36:52] kingdom of hell shake." That's right.
[1:36:58] [snorts]
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Let me give you some recommendations.
[1:37:02] Stop complaining.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Look at your neighbor and say, "Stop
[1:37:06] complaining."
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; If you just told your wife that,
[1:37:12] have prayer.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Have enough sense to know when to say
[1:37:33] that.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Refuse to give the enemy voice.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Refuse to give the enemy voice.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Refuse. He tells you God don't love you,
[1:37:52] then don't repeat it.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; He tells you nobody loves you in church,
[1:37:57] don't repeat it.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Don't give him voice
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; CUZ HE'S LYING TO start off with
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; and you being a child of God, then you
[1:38:09] repeat a lie.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; You're giving the devil credit.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? THINK VICTORY.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; WALK VICTORY.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; TALK [screaming] VICTORY.
[1:38:26] [snorts]
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Never give up.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, you don't know what I'm
[1:38:34] going through. Hello.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; I don't need to get started there.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you a news bulletin for
[1:38:45] you. God answers prayer. Hallelujah.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Tell your neighbor, God answers prayer.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now, Brother Ron? I'm
[1:39:00] just so blue and so so defeated all the
[1:39:03] time. I I I fight Maybe this is for
[1:39:05] somebody poor soul out on the internet.
[1:39:07] I just fight depression all the time.
[1:39:11] Well, I Here's what I want you to do. A
[1:39:13] little homework for you. go back and
[1:39:15] remember the things that you talk about.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And if you're constantly given a
[1:39:23] negative
[1:39:25] confession,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; if you're constantly given a negative
[1:39:30] confession, that's building the
[1:39:32] atmosphere that you live in.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUR CONFESSION IS WHAT BRINGS
[1:39:38] FAITH.
[1:39:40] Speak things as though they are not and
[1:39:43] then walk into them.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT SUCCESSFUL. START
[1:39:49] SPEAKING IT.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? YOU HATE YOUR JOB?
[1:39:54] START TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU'RE
[1:39:56] THANKFUL THAT GOD GAVE YOU A job that
[1:39:59] you can still work.
[1:40:03] [applause]
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; GOD PUT BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS. HE GAVE
[1:40:08] ENERGY to your muscles THAT YOU CAN
[1:40:11] STILL GO ON. [applause and cheering]
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; How big is our God? We talked about this
[1:40:23] a couple months ago. How big is our God?
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; How really big is our God?
[1:40:33] How big? He created the universe. As a
[1:40:36] matter of fact, science has not even
[1:40:38] discovered everything that's out there.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; And God simply said, "Let there be."
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know how anybody can believe
[1:40:51] that there's not a God.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; When all you've got to do is look up.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And the first Bible's in the heavens.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; You can't get away from this Bible cuz
[1:41:02] it's in the heavens,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And then it's in a pyramid. That's
[1:41:05] right.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Now it's in your hands.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Heard Andrew quoting last night and then
[1:41:14] brother
[1:41:16] brother Gabe put it on his on his
[1:41:18] morning devotion about restoration.
[1:41:22] Will God forgive me of my sins? Will he
[1:41:25] restore me? This this this is in front
[1:41:28] of me now. No sin is too deep.
[1:41:34] No heart is too far away.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; God's love reaches further
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; than we can ever
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; imagine. [clears throat]
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Gabriel named his little boy
[1:41:51] Uriah.
[1:41:53] Brother Random said that's the first man
[1:41:55] that he would like to shake hands with
[1:41:57] when he got to heaven. Yeah.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Yet Uriah was murdered by David.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; He was murdered because David committed
[1:42:08] a sin.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; The same man that wrote Psalms. That's
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; The same man that was a phenomenal
[1:42:17] fighter for God.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Brother B said, "I I want to I want to
[1:42:23] shake Uriah's hand
[1:42:25] when I get there." Not David's hand. Not
[1:42:28] Solomon's hands, Uriah's hands. You
[1:42:31] named You named your boy Uriah based on
[1:42:35] that.
[1:42:39] Think about that.
[1:42:41] Uriah was not a Jewish person.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; He was a Gentile.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; No sin is too deep,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; brother Ron. But I don't have a chance.
[1:42:54] You're still breathing.
[1:42:58] You're still breathing.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brother Ron? But but
[1:43:06] I'm too far away.
[1:43:09] Huh?
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Really?
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; God knows where you're at.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; God's bigger than your fears.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; He's greater THAN ALL YOUR STRUGGLES.
[1:43:24] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; HE'S STRONGER THAN EVERY ENEMY
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; So confess
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; if all of THAT BE TRUE, CONFESS VICTORY.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; WALK VICTORY. THINK VICTORY.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Rhonda, where you getting this?
[1:43:44] Third pull.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Third pull. This is
[1:43:51] part of it. It comes out of perfect
[1:43:53] faith. BE DETERMINED.
[1:43:56] DON'T BE DEFEATED BECAUSE YOU CAN'T be
[1:43:59] defeated. You're children of God. GOD
[1:44:04] PROMISED THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT is given
[1:44:07] to every believer.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:44:19] [clears throat]
[1:44:22] I want to give you one quote that's
[1:44:24] really powerful.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; The devil has no answer for the blood of
[1:44:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Say it to your neighbor. The devil has
[1:44:39] no answer for the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:44] So every accusation that would come
[1:44:47] against you, every fall into a pit that
[1:44:49] would come against you,
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; the devil does not have an answer for
[1:44:54] the blood.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Because when your sins hit the blood,
[1:45:00] the blood annihilates them.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I love what you said last night. as if
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; it takes you back to the condition,
[1:45:12] the condition of innocence.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; We can go ahead and stop and preach and
[1:45:18] just dance for a while right there.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Well, brother Ron,
[1:45:24] let let's just talk about your armor
[1:45:26] just for just a few minutes.
[1:45:31] Let's just talk about even your
[1:45:33] identification right now. You are
[1:45:35] justified.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; You can shout. It's as though you never
[1:45:41] did it
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; in the first place.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Let it go.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; Stop digging up bones.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Let it [screaming] go.
[1:45:54] Let it go.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; And listen, IF YOU'RE JUSTIFIED, LET ME
[1:45:58] JUST SAY, LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBORS AS
[1:46:01] they're justified.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] Quit picking up rocks.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; QUIT PICKING UP ROCKS. GOD FORGAVE YOU
[1:46:11] OF YOUR SINS. HE FORGAVE THEM OF THEIR
[1:46:13] SINS.
[1:46:15] [applause]
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; It comes TO THE NEXT POINT. YOU ARE
[1:46:26] FORGIVEN.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:32] What can wash away my sins?
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN
[1:46:40] make me whole again?
[1:46:53] Many of our homes have a protection
[1:46:55] system over it.
[1:46:57] That's as good as long as the
[1:46:59] electricity works.
[1:47:02] Are you with me? Or the battery works.
[1:47:05] But you're covered by the blood of Jesus
[1:47:08] Christ.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; And it's eternal.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; You're accepted.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I just want to feel
[1:47:19] accepted. You already are.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Many times you beg for things and you
[1:47:25] already got it.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I I would like to be rich.
[1:47:36] Well, you already are.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; It's not the money that's in your
[1:47:42] billfold, right?
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, my wife's got my bill
[1:47:45] fold. Where you going with that, baby?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Boy, that was good timing, wasn't it?
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; I had a bad day yesterday. I may have a
[1:48:01] bad evening.
[1:48:06] God has declared you righteous.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:48:13] not a fickle man.
[1:48:15] God has declared you righteous. HOW,
[1:48:18] BROTHER RON? HE gave you his.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; Taking the scriptures, YOU ARE BEYOND
[1:48:29] CONDEMNATION.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Romans 8, there is therefore now NO
[1:48:35] CONDEMNATION. SO, YOU'RE BEYOND IT.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Then quit BEATING YOURSELF UP.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; GIVE THE LORD a good hand right there.
[1:48:52] [applause]
[1:48:56] I found a quote the other day that says,
[1:48:58] "Righteousness does not grow old and it
[1:49:02] does not move around or flex
[1:49:06] with your moods."
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That's quite powerful, isn't it?
[1:49:11] It stands forever
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; even in heaven.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love it?
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:49:25] now this this garment that we wear,
[1:49:29] helmet, breastplate,
[1:49:32] all that we wear, it's not a ceremonial
[1:49:37] affair.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:49:40] This is not a ten can outfit that you
[1:49:43] are going to see in a museum,
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; This is God's word put on you. The
[1:49:52] scripture says, "Take on you."
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Put it on.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Wear it.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; AND DON'T JUST WEAR IT, FIGHT WITH IT.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME? YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING
[1:50:05] WITH YOUR EMOTIONS. YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH
[1:50:07] THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:50:09] YOU'RE TAKING GOD'S word
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; and USING IT AGAINST THE ENEMY.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; This is not a Hallmark card.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Or a Hallmark movie.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; This is God's word.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And it says you can overcome.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Now, the helmet is part of the armor
[1:50:32] that that keeps your identity safe.
[1:50:38] You are in God's army
[1:50:40] and you're standing secure because of
[1:50:43] what Christ has already done for you.
[1:50:45] And the word of God is unstoppable
[1:50:50] no matter how Satan attacks you. And it
[1:50:53] can never take the place
[1:50:56] of God's word. That's
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us TO BE STRONG
[1:51:04] IN the Lord. Amen.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; AND THEN THE POWER OF HIS MIGHT.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; You that fight diseases,
[1:51:15] you just came through it.
[1:51:22] You had some really bad days.
[1:51:25] And there were some days, Sister Wanda,
[1:51:27] that you felt like you couldn't put one
[1:51:29] foot in front of the other.
[1:51:32] [snorts]
[1:51:33] So, you're not trusting in your might.
[1:51:40] You know, somebody that's never been
[1:51:41] sick don't understand that.
[1:51:44] They just don't understand that. But
[1:51:47] there are days that I beg the left foot
[1:51:50] to move out onto the floor.
[1:51:53] And then I follow it with the right foot
[1:51:57] and I lay there with my head across the
[1:52:00] bed and saying, "How am I going to get
[1:52:02] the strength to get out of the bed?" But
[1:52:05] you know what I do? Fight.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; I'm not here this morning preaching to
[1:52:12] you because I I feel like it.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; I'm here because God
[1:52:18] gave me the job.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; And it's NOT BASED ON MY FEELINGS.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; God will provide strength for me.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Let's let's just preach
[1:52:31] right here for a minute. [applause]
[1:52:40] GOD'S ARMOR IS designed by God himself.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; It is tempered by God. IT IS GIVEN GOD'S
[1:52:48] own strength. That's
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; And
[1:52:53] you hear brother Brandham talk about
[1:52:55] that little police guy down there said
[1:52:57] he doesn't have the power to stop a
[1:52:59] bicycle. Right.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; But that badge HAS THE AUTHORITY OF ALL
[1:53:04] OF THE GOVERNMENT of that city behind
[1:53:06] him.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; He can blow his whistle and put his arm
[1:53:10] out AND BIG OLD TRUCKS HAVE TO STOP.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; AND HE REMINDS US THAT WHEN WE QUOTE THE
[1:53:18] WORD, ALL of heaven
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; ALL OF HEAVEN IS BEHIND US.
[1:53:31] Why don't you just say boo devil right
[1:53:33] now?
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:42] Hallelujah.
[1:53:44] Are you with me now?
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; Now we have authority
[1:53:50] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:53:53] The little lady that just went to the
[1:53:55] back,
[1:53:57] she's my wife.
[1:54:00] She took on my name.
[1:54:03] She signs all my checks.
[1:54:07] All
[1:54:10] if I signed a check, the bank would kick
[1:54:13] it back.
[1:54:17] And say somebody fraud signed your check
[1:54:20] because in 1983
[1:54:24] she got authority. Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Those two became one.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; If you would ask me, brother, how much
[1:54:38] money do you have in bank? And I'm not
[1:54:39] rich. How much money do you have in the
[1:54:42] bank? I have no clue, but I'm not
[1:54:44] worried.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Let me just say, as a
[1:54:50] Christian,
[1:54:52] I can't fathom how much power is in the
[1:54:54] word of God.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; But let me just say, I don't worry about
[1:54:59] it because he's behind me.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; But when I come to a need,
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; how many's ever been in need? YOU SIGN
[1:55:06] THE CHECK and send it through the bank
[1:55:09] of heaven,
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; it will not bounce.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Let me just give you just a few more.
[1:55:26] Are we still okay?
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; When you stand in the moment that you're
[1:55:32] standing in, there's going to be times
[1:55:34] that you stand when others fall apart.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; I I just want to tell you some re
[1:55:40] realistic things right here. While
[1:55:43] you're standing in the word of God,
[1:55:46] there's going to be friends around you
[1:55:48] fall apart. Get that get that clear in
[1:55:49] your mind. Especially young people, get
[1:55:52] it clear in your mind. Not everybody's
[1:55:54] elect. Not everybody's predestinated.
[1:55:57] There are going to be some of your
[1:55:59] friends that will fall apart.
[1:56:07] We hear people say, "Well, they're
[1:56:08] better off now than living here in this
[1:56:11] life.
[1:56:13] That ain't necessarily true.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; That ain't necessarily true. If you're a
[1:56:17] Christian, that's that's right. Are you
[1:56:20] with me? But if you've lived a halfway
[1:56:22] life and you lived a sinner, you have
[1:56:24] just stepped into a really bad spot.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Angels didn't walk in the door to take
[1:56:30] you home.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Another realm walked in the door.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I do not want that happening
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; in your life.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. and definitely not mine.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; There's something about your sight that
[1:56:51] Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes, for
[1:56:53] they see."
[1:56:56] So if God gives you sight to see and to
[1:56:59] understand,
[1:57:01] there are others that are blinded
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; and you point people to the scriptures
[1:57:08] and they still can't see it.
[1:57:10] It's in black and white and they still
[1:57:13] can't understand it.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; You point it to Malachi 45 and 6 and you
[1:57:20] believe IT WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; REVELATIONS 10 AND 7. YOU BELIEVE that
[1:57:24] with all your heart and yet FRIENDS THAT
[1:57:27] YOU POINT towards
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; cannot see it to save their life.
[1:57:34] Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:57:35] Christ. YOU CAN SEE IT.
[1:57:40] AND YET MULTITUDES WILL LOOK AT it
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; and believe a trinity baptism.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "Blessed are yours,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; for they see.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Blessed are your ears, for they hear."
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; What are you doing right there, Brother
[1:58:02] Ryan? I want you to understand
[1:58:06] there's a lot of people that can't stand
[1:58:10] where you stand.
[1:58:12] But that should not shake you.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; All of us has got business friends. All
[1:58:24] of us has got buddies at work. All of us
[1:58:27] has got different family members that
[1:58:29] you would love to see come in.
[1:58:32] you'd love to see come in.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; You can't make them see it.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; It takes a revelation of the word of God
[1:58:40] that drops into your heart and you go,
[1:58:42] "That's a truth." That's right.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have to stop. But
[1:58:50] it's kind of like a man was handed a
[1:58:52] handing him a book
[1:58:55] and he was asked to read this book of
[1:58:56] the message and he read it
[1:59:01] and he brought the book back and he
[1:59:04] said, "That man called me a buzzard.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; That man called me a buzzard." And the
[1:59:12] man said looked at him and said, 'You
[1:59:14] know the funny thing? I read the same
[1:59:15] book and he called me an eagle.
[1:59:22] [applause]
[1:59:31] [applause]
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; And if you call me an eagle, that's what
[1:59:37] I am.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And I was born to fly.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:42] There's something about an eagle that
[1:59:44] when he gets in trouble, he is built
[1:59:48] on
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; with his claws.
[1:59:52] And he can crush the enemy with them
[1:59:54] claws.
[1:59:55] It's phenomenal how much power he's got
[1:59:59] in them claws. He's got certain amount
[2:00:01] of power in his [clears throat] legs,
[2:00:05] but where his safety is is in his wings.
[2:00:10] Amen.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; His safety is in his wings.
[2:00:15] And so when he comes into a storm, what
[2:00:18] does he do? He's built to go up.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Now, a hawk, IF HE ATTEMPTS to do that,
[2:00:27] he'll blow apart cuz he's not built to
[2:00:29] do it. But an eagle
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; is built for rapture.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; And in this rapture, we're going to
[2:00:38] leave, saints.
[2:00:40] This earth can't hold us down. SO HE
[2:00:43] SETS HIS WINGS
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; AND IT CAN FLY ABOVE THE HIGHEST
[2:00:47] MOUNTAIN,
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; but he has the eyesight to see miles
[2:00:53] away.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; And he can see things that other birds
[2:00:59] can't see. Amen.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; We sung a song just a few moments ago
[2:01:09] about stay.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go.
[2:01:17] When you feel the presence of God come
[2:01:19] in your car,
[2:01:21] get real quiet and just begin to
[2:01:23] worship. When he comes in your home,
[2:01:27] say, "Father, fill me with your
[2:01:29] presence.
[2:01:31] I don't care how long you've been a
[2:01:33] Christian. All of us need more."
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Ron, I wish I was like that guy.
[2:01:39] I wish I was like that lady. Let me just
[2:01:40] say this to you. They need they need
[2:01:42] this as much as you need it.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; They need it as much as you need it.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Could we just stand now?
[2:02:07] We put on the helmet.
[2:02:10] We put on the breastplate. We pick up
[2:02:12] our sword.
[2:02:15] All of the armor that we have is for the
[2:02:18] front of us.
[2:02:21] There's nothing for the back.
[2:02:24] So, it's not for quitting
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; and it's not for giving up.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; It's for fighting your enemy.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Your enemy, whether it be cancer or
[2:02:33] whether it be unbelief and Mr. Skeptic
[2:02:35] and Mr. Impatient.
[2:02:38] All of us have to fight the symptoms of
[2:02:42] life.
[2:02:43] Amen. Every one of us have to fight. God
[2:02:47] bless you this morning. Don't you love
[2:02:49] the Lord with all your heart? Give the
[2:02:51] Lord a great big hand this morning.
[2:02:53] [applause]
