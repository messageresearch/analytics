[50:56] receive Lord we grant our or we ask Lord
[50:59] that you would take complete control of
[51:01] the service tonight in the name of the
[51:03] Lord Jesus Christ and the bride says
[51:06] amen amen if you have your Bibles this
[51:09] evening would like to look over in the
[51:10] book of haggai chapter 2
[51:14] .
[51:15] haggai chapter 2 and verse 1. if you
[51:18] don't know where it's at it's in the Old
[51:20] Testament between the Z's of Zephaniah
[51:22] and Zechariah
[51:24] if you go to Matthew and flip back three
[51:26] chapters
[51:29] three books you'll find haga
[51:32] very very short book to us but it's a
[51:36] very powerful book
[51:38] very powerful book and
[51:44] you know God does all things all things
[51:47] will
[51:48] and he has everything
[51:51] planned out according to his timing
[51:54] amen
[51:56] amen
[51:57] hey God chapter 2 and verse 1. and in
[52:01] the seventh month and in the one and
[52:03] twentieth day of the month came the word
[52:05] of the Lord by the prophet haggai saying
[52:08] speak now to zerubbabel the son of the
[52:11] son of shatel governor of Judah and to
[52:14] Joshua the son of jehoshadek the high
[52:17] priest and to the residue of the people
[52:18] saying
[52:19] who is left among you that saw this
[52:22] house in her first glory and how do you
[52:24] see it now is it not in your eyes in
[52:27] comparison of it as of nothing
[52:30] yet now be strong O's a rubable saith
[52:33] the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of
[52:36] jehoshadek the high priest and be strong
[52:39] O ye people of the land saith the Lord
[52:41] and work for I Am With You
[52:45] whenever God speaks to us and says I'm
[52:47] with you it doesn't matter what we're
[52:49] going through it doesn't matter what
[52:51] we're facing it gives us a courage to
[52:54] press on in the battle
[52:56] for I Am with You saith the Lord of
[52:58] hosts according to the word that I
[53:00] Covenant with you when you came out of
[53:03] Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you
[53:06] fear ye not
[53:07] for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet
[53:10] once it is a little while and I will
[53:13] shake the heavens and the earth and the
[53:15] Sea and the dry land and I will shake
[53:18] All Nations and the desire of all
[53:20] Nations shall come and I will fill this
[53:23] house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts
[53:25] the silver is mine and the gold is mine
[53:28] saith the Lord of hosts the glory of
[53:31] this latterhouse shall be greater than
[53:34] of the former saith the Lord of hosts
[53:36] and in this place will I give peace
[53:39] saith the Lord of hosts John chapter 1
[53:42] and verse 14.
[53:46] then also down to John chapter 14.
[53:49] John chapter 1 and verse 14 and the Word
[53:52] was made flesh and dwelt amongst us and
[53:55] we beheld his glory the glory as of the
[53:59] only begotten of the father full of
[54:02] grace
[54:03] and of Truth also John chapter 14 and
[54:06] verse 12.
[54:13] verily verily I say unto you that he
[54:16] that believeth on me the works that I do
[54:19] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[54:23] these shall he do because I go unto my
[54:26] father
[54:26] and whatsoever you shall ask in my name
[54:29] that will I do that the father may be
[54:32] glorified in the son if you shall ask
[54:34] anything in my name I will do it may God
[54:39] bless his word he may be seated in the
[54:41] presence of the Lord and from these
[54:43] scripture readings tonight I'd like to
[54:45] gather a thought from the word of God
[54:48] here in hagai that the glory of this
[54:51] latter house shall be greater than of
[54:54] the former the glory of the latterhouse
[54:56] shall be greater than the former and out
[54:59] of the message of lifting him up out of
[55:01] History he says he said we're standing
[55:04] here tonight upon the brim and watching
[55:06] come to pass and unfold two great scenes
[55:10] and those two great scenes are these one
[55:13] of them is the ending of history and the
[55:15] other one is the ending of time and many
[55:17] great men down Through the Ages has long
[55:19] deceived this hour that we are now
[55:21] approaching as we live in this glorious
[55:24] setting of mortal sun and breaking of
[55:26] eternal life he said I do feel that we
[55:29] are living in one of the grandest ages
[55:31] that has ever been that man that ever
[55:33] man has been permitted to live because
[55:35] it's the closing out of time and it's
[55:38] the blending in of Eternity history only
[55:40] tells us what we have read of what has
[55:43] been and what's in the future lays in
[55:46] the very hand of God and we recognize
[55:49] that tonight that if time would go on
[55:51] that there would be history books that
[55:54] would be that would be ruled after this
[55:56] generation that would come but we
[55:57] recognize that we are at the very ending
[56:00] of time that there will be no there will
[56:02] be no history upon upon what you're
[56:04] going through right now and I think that
[56:07] tonight I think Where We Gather this
[56:09] thought of lifting him up out of history
[56:11] and I think that there ever was a time
[56:13] that we ought to lift our Lord Jesus
[56:15] Christ out of history that it's right
[56:18] now because we're recognizing that we
[56:20] are living in a world that that is
[56:22] wanting to do away with the very image
[56:24] of God they're wanting to do away with a
[56:26] very simple of God and ever there was a
[56:28] time that we ought to lift up the name
[56:30] of Jesus Christ and not be afraid to
[56:32] stand up for our god-given rights it's
[56:35] right now in the midst of this lay
[56:38] Odyssey and age when we recognize that
[56:40] we are in the darkest of all ages but we
[56:43] recognize that it is in this age that he
[56:46] comes at the ending of all of the seeing
[56:48] all of the things that he gives us the
[56:50] very token life and we recognize that
[56:53] after all of them seals that was laid
[56:55] back there that that had been bound for
[56:57] all of those years but now all of the
[56:59] message is capped off in this one thing
[57:01] and it is the very token life of
[57:04] almighty God now just to give you a
[57:07] little bit of background just for a
[57:08] moment of Hagia that Hagar was a prophet
[57:11] of the restored Remnant after the 70
[57:13] years of that captivity where they were
[57:16] down there in Babylon and you go to
[57:18] studying out the book of haggai you'll
[57:20] look at his ministry that the very theme
[57:23] of it was to them of the unfinished
[57:26] Temple and his mission was to admonish
[57:28] was to admonish and encourage the
[57:30] builders or the workers of that day so
[57:33] so you begin to look and you'll begin to
[57:35] see in the book of haggad that he began
[57:37] to rebuke them because of their lack of
[57:40] their fervency of working upon the
[57:42] Temple of the Lord but then he comes
[57:45] around and he brings a message of
[57:47] encouragement and I think it's amazing
[57:49] that God what he does he causes us to
[57:51] repent but then he grings about a
[57:54] message of Grace he shows us where we're
[57:56] wrong but he brings about a message of
[57:58] Grace so haggai he rebukes them for
[58:00] their lack of fervency but he comes
[58:02] behind them with a message of
[58:04] encouragement you see God will not leave
[58:06] you where he found you at God will not
[58:08] leave you in the current condition that
[58:10] you are in he will not leave you in your
[58:12] former condition but I want to say this
[58:14] or let this be a theme of our thought
[58:16] tonight that the latter part of your
[58:18] life will be the greater part of your
[58:20] life and that's what hagasa Ministry was
[58:22] it was to set about a course to
[58:25] encourage them in the very work of the
[58:27] Lord and if there's one thing that I I
[58:29] want to do in my life I want to
[58:32] encourage every person every young
[58:34] person every little child every middle
[58:36] age and every old person to encourage
[58:38] them to believe that God is still God
[58:40] and that he's still on his throne and he
[58:42] still cares about you
[58:44] but notice notice then he brings he
[58:47] brings this message of the future glory
[58:50] of the temple you see that the very
[58:52] general design of the book of haggai it
[58:55] was to reprove the Jews for their
[58:57] negligence in the building up of the
[58:59] temple after that they had been given or
[59:01] Liberty that was granted to them my
[59:04] Cyrus to build to build the work of the
[59:07] Lord and their haga he encouraged them
[59:09] to look and look that there was a
[59:12] promise of a messiah that was coming and
[59:15] when you look at haggai's name his name
[59:17] his name signifies or speaks to us to be
[59:21] able to keep a feast or it signifies a
[59:24] time of festival or a time of joy and
[59:27] haggai was standing there under under
[59:30] his under his name and under his
[59:32] character and he was standing there and
[59:35] he was telling them you're looking at
[59:36] the work but I'm telling you that
[59:38] there's a time of joy that is coming you
[59:41] see what heck I was doing he was he was
[59:44] said about haggai that one Earnest man
[59:46] can arouse the entire Community you see
[59:49] you let a Fire Glow in our hearts and
[59:52] it'll spread that's what John Wesley
[59:54] said he said you like one man you set
[59:56] one man on fire and the world will come
[59:58] and watch him burn and haggai was
[1:00:01] assured of God's presence and had I
[1:00:04] assured the Church of the Living God of
[1:00:06] that day The Remnant that was left over
[1:00:08] there he assured them of God's presence
[1:00:11] and within three weeks the whole land
[1:00:14] was awake to the fact that God was going
[1:00:17] to come and do a greater work now let's
[1:00:19] think about this message that it's that
[1:00:21] it circled the world seven times over
[1:00:23] and what has it done it has awoken a
[1:00:26] sleeping virgin it's awoken abroad to
[1:00:29] recognize who they are it's encouraged
[1:00:31] our heart to recognize that the former
[1:00:34] shall be greater than the latter
[1:00:38] so so the glory of this latter house is
[1:00:42] going to be greater than that of the
[1:00:44] former says the Lord of hosts so you see
[1:00:47] the very former or the first house which
[1:00:50] was built by Solomon which was which was
[1:00:53] a very glorious one and if we would
[1:00:55] consider the very the the very Treasures
[1:00:58] of Solomon's Temple where you look at
[1:01:00] the riches that was laid up by David and
[1:01:03] was given to Solomon for building it if
[1:01:05] you look at the great workmen that
[1:01:07] worked upon Solomon's Temple that was
[1:01:10] employed to work upon it or if you look
[1:01:12] at the statelessness of the fabric of
[1:01:14] the of the Dynamics of the building
[1:01:16] itself then you would look at the latter
[1:01:19] house and you would think Ma this is
[1:01:21] nothing to compare to the former house
[1:01:26] to the like which we see in the first
[1:01:28] house it was you see the very depiction
[1:01:30] you see the very one that drawn it out
[1:01:33] the architect was almighty God
[1:01:35] you see he'd set out the decorations of
[1:01:38] it he'd set out the vessels in it and
[1:01:40] above all the glory of the Lord came
[1:01:43] down and it filled it and continued
[1:01:45] there
[1:01:46] but God was saying about this I know
[1:01:49] that it doesn't look like it was in
[1:01:51] Solomon's time but I want to say to you
[1:01:54] that the glory of the latterhouse
[1:01:57] is going to be greater than that of the
[1:02:00] former house so I want you just just to
[1:02:03] grab your mind just for a minute that in
[1:02:05] the Jews mind that that this Temple
[1:02:08] that's coming that this Temple that's
[1:02:10] going to be built it's going to be very
[1:02:12] great I'm going to have to be glorious
[1:02:14] it's going to have to exceed it's going
[1:02:16] to have to exceed some great things to
[1:02:18] be greater than that of Solomon's Temple
[1:02:22] but when the latter house was built
[1:02:27] the Jews themselves recognized things
[1:02:30] lacking in the latter which is laying
[1:02:33] there in the former
[1:02:34] they begin to look at it they begin to
[1:02:36] look at it through the scriptures or
[1:02:38] they begin to look at it through the
[1:02:39] through the lens of their opinion or
[1:02:41] through their perspective and they were
[1:02:43] not looking at it in the way that God
[1:02:45] looked at God asked them to look at it
[1:02:48] and I think it's amazing that Humanity
[1:02:50] has the ability to look at things the
[1:02:52] way they want to instead of the way that
[1:02:55] God wants them to look at it so they
[1:02:57] were looking at the former house and
[1:02:59] they seen things that were missing in
[1:03:01] the latter house they seemed that the
[1:03:02] Ark of the Covenant was missing they
[1:03:04] seemed that the original fire that was
[1:03:06] that was lit by all almighty God was
[1:03:08] missing they seen that the urum and
[1:03:10] famine was missing they met they seemed
[1:03:12] that the anointing oil and the cherubims
[1:03:14] they were missing and all of the older
[1:03:17] men that had that had seen the the
[1:03:19] former house they begin to sit there and
[1:03:21] they begin to weep because of that it
[1:03:24] came short of the other house that was
[1:03:27] there in the former house
[1:03:30] yeah
[1:03:31] you can imagine
[1:03:33] those that had seen the former house and
[1:03:35] those that had seen the latter house
[1:03:37] and I think it's a it's it's it's human
[1:03:40] tendency to depreciate the present
[1:03:43] because of the glories of the past
[1:03:46] the old people look back to the days of
[1:03:48] the former Temple even as we are out to
[1:03:51] look back to upon times of great
[1:03:53] preachers of the past of all I wish for
[1:03:55] the Homer could be back here or oh my we
[1:03:58] sure had a wonderful time back there
[1:04:00] when when we were back there on Summit
[1:04:03] or we we sure had a good time when we
[1:04:05] were up there in brother Bill's house or
[1:04:06] are we sure we sure had a good time when
[1:04:09] we was out there in an old tent meetings
[1:04:11] you know it's amazing that Humanity can
[1:04:14] look through the lens of their
[1:04:15] perspective instead of the way God wants
[1:04:18] them to look at it
[1:04:21] see they will sit there they were
[1:04:22] sitting there and think this this Temple
[1:04:24] that is built has nothing compared to
[1:04:27] the temple
[1:04:30] my let me let me drop back and just
[1:04:33] preach just for a moment this this one
[1:04:35] has no no caught the converts the
[1:04:37] converts that we got when we were back
[1:04:39] there in the old house meetings or the
[1:04:41] or the sabbaths that we kept back there
[1:04:43] in the temple they'll never be compared
[1:04:46] to what's happening here you know what
[1:04:48] Satan's middle name is it's regret
[1:04:51] it's regret and a lot of people they'll
[1:04:54] sit there in the days gone by and
[1:04:57] they'll say my I wish I could have gone
[1:04:58] back to Days Gone By I wish I could have
[1:05:01] been here when Jesus was here what day
[1:05:03] are you living in the same yesterday
[1:05:06] today and forever you don't need to look
[1:05:09] back to Days Gone By you need to look up
[1:05:11] to the hour that you're living in it's
[1:05:13] the hour
[1:05:16] it's the hour of the son of man
[1:05:19] [Music]
[1:05:24] but I really I really want to grab your
[1:05:27] attention right here and I know that I'm
[1:05:28] going just a little bit differently but
[1:05:30] this is how the Lord is laying some
[1:05:31] things out but a lot of times Humanity
[1:05:34] has a way of looking at things
[1:05:37] and they'll have a lay of looking at
[1:05:38] things in my when brother Homer was here
[1:05:41] things was completely different you're
[1:05:44] right
[1:05:46] you're right we're not taken away from
[1:05:49] the former
[1:05:50] is that right but you see that Satan's
[1:05:53] middle name is Regret and a lot of times
[1:05:56] people spend time thinking about days
[1:05:58] gone by and things are things man I wish
[1:06:01] I could have really been here when
[1:06:03] William Bradham was here I wish I really
[1:06:05] would have I wish I really would have
[1:06:06] enjoyed where I was living at you see
[1:06:09] the reason why people live in regret is
[1:06:12] because they did not accept what was
[1:06:15] really happening and if time will tarry
[1:06:17] you will speak about the seasons of life
[1:06:19] that we are in right now and if you
[1:06:21] don't accept
[1:06:23] if you don't accept where we are you
[1:06:26] will go on to regret what is happening
[1:06:28] now so I want to say to you don't miss
[1:06:32] what is happening and enjoy the season
[1:06:34] of the lord The Rapture is at hand don't
[1:06:37] miss
[1:06:39] don't miss what is happening it is the
[1:06:42] Shekinah Glory that is amongst us
[1:06:47] you see what they were looking at they
[1:06:48] were looking at the natural instead of
[1:06:51] the glory that was going to come and
[1:06:53] fill the latter house you see what gave
[1:06:55] the latter house the greater glory was a
[1:06:58] very personal presence of the Messiah in
[1:07:01] it you see his presence is what makes
[1:07:03] the difference
[1:07:05] I can look at every single one of your
[1:07:07] lives tonight and I could say this over
[1:07:09] your life that you're the latter part of
[1:07:12] your life is greater than the former
[1:07:14] part of your life
[1:07:16] William Branham said the only regret
[1:07:18] that I have is I didn't serve him so
[1:07:20] good in the first 25 years like I did in
[1:07:23] the past 25 years so let me say you it
[1:07:26] doesn't matter the hell hole you came
[1:07:28] out of it doesn't matter the sickness
[1:07:30] that you went through it doesn't matter
[1:07:31] the trouble that Satan put on your life
[1:07:34] the latter part is the greater part
[1:07:36] because it is his Destiny it is his
[1:07:40] power
[1:07:40] [Applause]
[1:07:42] it is his power that's making the
[1:07:44] difference
[1:07:45] it's Humanity that's making the
[1:07:47] difference but I want to say to you that
[1:07:49] a greater than Solomon is here
[1:07:51] and greater than all of the prophets is
[1:07:53] here and greater than Abraham we don't
[1:07:55] need to look back and think man I wish I
[1:07:57] could have lived there and had William
[1:07:59] Brandon discern my heart Who was the
[1:08:01] discerner
[1:08:02] who was the one that was there reading
[1:08:05] the very secrets of the heart it's the
[1:08:07] same one that's at the pulpit
[1:08:10] it's the same one right here and he's
[1:08:13] greater
[1:08:14] if the queen of the South could ride all
[1:08:16] of those months and go up there to try
[1:08:19] to find the Messiah go up there and see
[1:08:21] the Messiah and Solomon how much more
[1:08:24] should we be able to look in the
[1:08:26] revealing of the son of man and see that
[1:08:29] it's still the same yesterday today and
[1:08:31] forever
[1:08:35] come on now
[1:08:42] but a lot of times
[1:08:47] I'm sorry I'm laboring here but a lot of
[1:08:50] times
[1:08:51] but I really enjoyed it when this one
[1:08:53] was here or that one was here and
[1:08:55] they're missing what's happening right
[1:08:56] now
[1:08:58] we are not diminishing what was we are
[1:09:01] just saying that we would not be here if
[1:09:04] they had not went
[1:09:05] we would not be standing on the
[1:09:07] Forefront where we're standing at if it
[1:09:10] hadn't been Trailblazers that had set a
[1:09:12] trail before us we're not saying or
[1:09:15] taken away from anybody but the reason
[1:09:17] why the fire is so great is they laid
[1:09:20] the fuel out there and when the Holy
[1:09:23] Ghost Came Upon it it made that which
[1:09:25] when the former greater in the latter
[1:09:28] what do Joe say that in the last days I
[1:09:31] will pour out my spirit on All Flesh the
[1:09:34] former and the latter rain and you are
[1:09:36] here in the greatest moving of the Holy
[1:09:38] Ghost you don't need to wish that he was
[1:09:40] back in 1906 to see the manifestations
[1:09:44] of the Holy Ghost it's a greater day
[1:09:48] than you ever looked at and ever lived
[1:09:50] in it's this day he said well I wish I
[1:09:53] could have been there and seen those
[1:09:55] great healings you are in the greatest
[1:09:57] healing Revival that you've ever seen
[1:09:59] the world is on fire with the moving of
[1:10:03] the Holy Ghost
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:06] you don't need William Branham to
[1:10:08] discern your heart he's still here the
[1:10:11] mighty Angel is still here you don't
[1:10:13] need a man to lay his hands on you you
[1:10:15] are under the greatest message that
[1:10:18] there is the opening of the word
[1:10:21] [Applause]
[1:10:32] but when Jesus
[1:10:35] Jesus went in the temple a Passover
[1:10:39] he walked in there
[1:10:42] and he looked at his father's house
[1:10:46] and said you've made my father's house
[1:10:50] a house of merchandise
[1:10:52] you've made it a den of Thieves
[1:10:55] and the Bible said that he that he
[1:10:57] scored together hurry bound together a
[1:11:00] small cord and he began to he began to
[1:11:03] get out
[1:11:04] into the fruit of the spirit and they
[1:11:06] begin to overthrow the table the money
[1:11:08] changers and he looked at on on them and
[1:11:12] said now look he said you destroy this
[1:11:14] Temple and in three days I'll race it
[1:11:17] back up again they said it took us 46
[1:11:20] years to build this Temple and yet
[1:11:22] you're saying that you can rear it back
[1:11:24] up in three days but they didn't
[1:11:26] recognize that he was talking about the
[1:11:28] Temple of his body because there was a
[1:11:31] veil in front of them there when the
[1:11:33] pillar of fire would stand behind the
[1:11:34] veil and he would hide behind the veil
[1:11:36] but now he was standing there in the
[1:11:39] robe of humanity and they didn't
[1:11:41] recognize that the very Shekinah Glory
[1:11:43] that came down on Mount Shania was
[1:11:46] standing there robed in the flesh of
[1:11:49] Jesus Christ if they were hid Their Eyes
[1:11:52] Were hidden because of the Veil
[1:11:55] come on now what did they miss they were
[1:11:58] missing the very glory of the Lord that
[1:12:01] was right in front of them
[1:12:07] you know when Jesus
[1:12:09] well Jesus is out preaching
[1:12:11] the Bible tells us in Matthew chapter 12
[1:12:13] that Jesus and his disciples were
[1:12:16] passing through a cornfield and his
[1:12:19] disciples were hungered and they began
[1:12:21] to pluck off the ears off out of the
[1:12:24] field and they begin to eat and there
[1:12:26] was those bunch of busy body Hypocrites
[1:12:28] over there they said now look here look
[1:12:31] at here your disciples are a bunch of
[1:12:33] Sinners they don't even keep this
[1:12:34] sabbath but Jesus reminded them of the
[1:12:37] word he said don't you remember when
[1:12:39] David our father when he was up there
[1:12:42] and he was hungered that he went into
[1:12:44] the place that he didn't belong in and
[1:12:46] started eating on the priests so bread
[1:12:48] that it was unlawful for him to eat of
[1:12:51] he said but I'll say this to you there
[1:12:53] is one amongst you that is greater than
[1:12:55] the temple that you're looking at you
[1:12:57] are not looking at a day you are looking
[1:13:00] at the lord of the Sabbath I'm Lord over
[1:13:03] this I own the rest so if he owns arrest
[1:13:06] he can give you peace and in this place
[1:13:10] I will give you peace
[1:13:13] now some of you went through all kinds
[1:13:15] of turmoil but this is a place that
[1:13:17] you'll find peace at
[1:13:20] Hallelujah it is not in what days gone
[1:13:24] by it's right now
[1:13:27] right now in your flesh is wrong deity
[1:13:30] deity's not in heaven deities in you
[1:13:33] everything you have need of in this
[1:13:36] life's journey what's given unto you
[1:13:38] when you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost
[1:13:42] you know
[1:13:45] but Jesus said to him
[1:13:48] because of your stinking traditions
[1:13:51] made my Commandments of no effect
[1:13:54] you see you see what you've done by your
[1:13:57] traditions and by your sacrifices and by
[1:14:00] your eye by by going in and making all
[1:14:02] of these Traditions what are you doing
[1:14:04] by all of your theology you are making
[1:14:07] my power unaffected
[1:14:10] and every time you try to put an
[1:14:12] intellectual giant over top of the word
[1:14:14] of God he makes the word of God
[1:14:17] uneffective but you put a real holy
[1:14:20] ghost-filled person whether they're a
[1:14:22] preacher or whether they're a wash woman
[1:14:23] you put the Holy Ghost on the inside of
[1:14:26] them and they'll recognize the very
[1:14:28] power of the Holy Ghost and it's not
[1:14:30] unaffected but it's effective that's why
[1:14:33] Satan is trying to do his very best to
[1:14:36] keep that the very deity of almighty God
[1:14:38] from getting behind
[1:14:41] your flesh
[1:14:44] you say once he was on the backside
[1:14:47] of badger skins
[1:14:49] and now he is still
[1:14:54] foreign
[1:14:58] he's ruthless
[1:15:00] but God wanted to hide himself
[1:15:05] through behind some hillbilly Badgers
[1:15:11] some Mountain talking batchers
[1:15:13] some people that the some people that
[1:15:15] had some rough characters about them
[1:15:18] some people that had some dark history
[1:15:19] about them some people that didn't know
[1:15:22] one thing about God
[1:15:23] but he wanted them
[1:15:26] because he knew that they would hide him
[1:15:29] and when when things would get rough you
[1:15:33] knew how to fight in the first place you
[1:15:35] was a fighter but he took that old
[1:15:37] nature out of you but he lays some of
[1:15:39] the character in there so that you'll
[1:15:41] fight for the Holy Ghost you see God put
[1:15:44] something on the inside of the elect of
[1:15:46] God she's not pushed around she's not
[1:15:49] having to be Mammy pimsy she doesn't
[1:15:51] have to have a bottle in her mouth all
[1:15:53] the time she knows who she is
[1:15:58] birthday
[1:16:00] he said no no notice what he says in
[1:16:02] serpent seed he said the reason that God
[1:16:04] is opening these things to us is God is
[1:16:07] bringing his sons in the manifestations
[1:16:09] and he's going beyond the limitations of
[1:16:12] any human knowledge way into the
[1:16:14] spiritual Revelations and he's bringing
[1:16:17] it down you see when Jarius had got in
[1:16:20] his condition
[1:16:22] when his very own daughter
[1:16:25] was out at the point of death Jarius
[1:16:28] knew that intellectual Creeds that he'd
[1:16:31] been studying as a priest would never
[1:16:34] get his daughter out of the condition
[1:16:35] that she was in
[1:16:38] he knew that the Theology of cairversis
[1:16:41] would not raise his daughter from the
[1:16:44] dead that she was in but I'll say this
[1:16:47] that if you are walking with Jesus you
[1:16:50] are walking Beyond human limitations
[1:16:56] you get what I'm saying to you if you're
[1:16:58] walking with Jesus you're walking Beyond
[1:17:00] human limitations so where I can take
[1:17:03] you is only so far because there's
[1:17:06] limits on where I can take you but where
[1:17:08] Jesus can take you is far beyond the bar
[1:17:12] it's far beyond your Creed it's far
[1:17:15] beyond your sin when you are walking
[1:17:17] with Jesus you are going Beyond human
[1:17:20] limitations
[1:17:21] but Jesus sometimes forces the issue to
[1:17:25] get you to believe him
[1:17:27] you see Jairus he was convinced that he
[1:17:30] was Jesus he was concerned he was
[1:17:32] convinced but Jesus gets you to a spot
[1:17:35] that he's going to force the issue to
[1:17:37] see if you'll really believe her to Show
[1:17:39] Your Colors he'll put you in trouble to
[1:17:42] really see if you really believe him
[1:17:53] you know the story there's a woman with
[1:17:55] a blood issue
[1:17:57] has dealt with this thing for 12 years
[1:18:03] she don't deserve to be around him
[1:18:05] according to the laws
[1:18:08] according to their theologies
[1:18:11] she has no business with Jesus
[1:18:14] but her faith was so strong that if I
[1:18:16] can just touch the hymn of His Garment
[1:18:19] the outer parts of His Garment that I'll
[1:18:21] be made home
[1:18:23] I want you to catch in the same picture
[1:18:24] there's Darius
[1:18:27] and there's a woman with a blood issue
[1:18:28] and Jairus was convinced he was
[1:18:32] convinced he was Jesus he was convinced
[1:18:35] of that which he read about in the
[1:18:37] Traditions when he read about Moses when
[1:18:40] he read about the glory of the Lord that
[1:18:42] had come down upon the mountain that
[1:18:43] even if a beast touched the mountain
[1:18:46] that he had to be thrust through he was
[1:18:48] convinced
[1:18:50] that that same power was
[1:18:54] he was convinced that the same one that
[1:18:57] said let there be was in this Temple he
[1:19:00] was so convinced that there was nothing
[1:19:04] there was nothing in his school that
[1:19:07] could keep him from believing in Jesus
[1:19:10] but I want you to watch the attitude of
[1:19:13] Jesus that when Jesus is touched by the
[1:19:16] woman with a blood issue
[1:19:18] Jarius doesn't get jealous
[1:19:21] Jarius doesn't lose Faith watch his
[1:19:24] attitude he doesn't get jealous that she
[1:19:27] got healed first
[1:19:30] [Applause]
[1:19:40] he doesn't get jealous
[1:19:43] his faith didn't leave her
[1:19:47] I don't care
[1:19:48] if I'm in the worst condition I don't
[1:19:51] care how bad I am if he can get to you
[1:19:54] first
[1:19:55] let him get to you because I know that
[1:19:58] Jesus is on his way because I've called
[1:20:00] him to come I've asked him to come my
[1:20:03] attitude is not wavered in what I'm
[1:20:06] looking at when other people are getting
[1:20:08] healed it's just the further it's in my
[1:20:10] faith that greater is he that is in me
[1:20:13] that in he that is in the world if he
[1:20:16] could do it for her
[1:20:18] he can do it for me I'm not concerned if
[1:20:22] he lost his power he said virtue went
[1:20:25] for me when somebody touched me but
[1:20:27] Jarius was convinced he was so much
[1:20:30] Jesus
[1:20:32] he knew what he saw in the former would
[1:20:36] be greater in the latter are you how are
[1:20:38] you preaching with me tonight he knew
[1:20:40] what he saw in that little woman that
[1:20:42] what he'd see in his little daughter
[1:20:43] would be greater let me tell you he's
[1:20:46] still Jesus and he still raises a dead
[1:20:50] he's still in the resurrection power
[1:20:53] he's still in the Holy Ghost given power
[1:20:56] [Applause]
[1:21:04] hell messed up
[1:21:08] nothing can happen to you
[1:21:10] except God and allow the enemy to touch
[1:21:13] your life
[1:21:19] I know we have a hard time
[1:21:21] sometimes parents we tell our kids not
[1:21:25] to say stupid
[1:21:27] but we are dealing with a stupid devil
[1:21:33] can he say Amen
[1:21:36] now think about this God allows
[1:21:40] his arch enemy to touch your life
[1:21:44] because God knows that he's got
[1:21:45] confidence in you
[1:21:47] and you're convinced of who he is
[1:21:49] and Satan said oh how are we going to
[1:21:52] miss time
[1:21:55] but yet
[1:21:57] throughout it all who gets the glory
[1:22:02] you said well I don't know why I keep
[1:22:04] going through the mess that I'm in don't
[1:22:06] you recognize that all of your trials
[1:22:08] are precious gold
[1:22:11] don't you recognize that even though
[1:22:13] hell can touch your life it can make you
[1:22:15] sick as a dog it can make you it can
[1:22:17] make you it can make you do all kinds of
[1:22:19] different things hell has an effect upon
[1:22:22] it but do you realize that the effect of
[1:22:24] Heaven is greater than the fact of hell
[1:22:27] so hell has messed up when it's touched
[1:22:30] the children of the most high God
[1:22:33] you see there's a lot of people that
[1:22:35] don't want this in their Church there's
[1:22:37] a lot of people that don't want this
[1:22:38] power in their Church
[1:22:40] but God is as good as his word that if
[1:22:43] you believe him if you ask him he'll
[1:22:46] come by your way
[1:22:49] you know I was raised around farm
[1:22:51] animals all all our life and I can't
[1:22:54] tell you how many times I spent my papa
[1:22:56] Charlie getting cattle out of the fence
[1:23:01] they just they just love sticking their
[1:23:04] head
[1:23:06] through that woven wire and reaching
[1:23:08] over there what are they going after
[1:23:10] it's not that they want to get their
[1:23:11] head stuck they're going after the grass
[1:23:14] on the other side because they have ate
[1:23:16] up everything on this side of the fence
[1:23:19] and brother Branham said he said I am
[1:23:21] convinced that Pentecost is not an
[1:23:24] organization but Pentecost is an
[1:23:26] experience he said you can't fence off
[1:23:29] this Pentecostal experience you can try
[1:23:32] to Finch Us in and you can try to say
[1:23:34] that our young people will never get
[1:23:36] this Pentecostal experience but you
[1:23:38] can't fence in the Holy Ghost
[1:23:41] you see what we're doing we are making a
[1:23:44] way in the fence because there's
[1:23:45] somebody there's somebody asking there's
[1:23:49] somebody looking there's somebody seeing
[1:23:51] that there is a move of God
[1:23:54] let me tell you you can try to fence in
[1:23:57] the Ducks but God will raise the water
[1:23:59] so that the ducks can just float over
[1:24:01] the walls you can try everything you
[1:24:03] want to to keep us from understanding
[1:24:05] the power of Pentecost has returned but
[1:24:09] this that you're looking at is greater
[1:24:13] than what you've seen at Azusa it's
[1:24:15] greater than what you've seen in Acts 2
[1:24:17] this is the restoration of all things
[1:24:26] foreign
[1:24:29] you see what his Shekinah Glory did
[1:24:32] we dropped down in the temple it ripened
[1:24:36] the showbread so what did it do what did
[1:24:40] it do that which was laying there in
[1:24:42] seed form he brought the pass in bread
[1:24:45] form
[1:24:46] you see what everything what God is
[1:24:48] doing right now is there has been Gene
[1:24:51] seeds of God that have been deposited
[1:24:53] throughout his foreknowledge and what is
[1:24:55] he doing his Shekinah is coming down and
[1:24:58] it is ripening what is laying there in
[1:25:01] the word so what is he doing with his
[1:25:04] glory right now he's bringing it to pass
[1:25:09] thank you
[1:25:10] he's bringing it to pass
[1:25:12] through a Ministry of Malachi 4 and is
[1:25:15] revealing it to the very hearts of the
[1:25:18] children that have been turned back to
[1:25:20] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers
[1:25:22] what is he doing he says in your Veil to
[1:25:26] bring his word to pass
[1:25:28] you see just like 2000 years ago just
[1:25:30] like 2000 years ago if you look at it in
[1:25:32] that perspective that Humanity was
[1:25:35] looking at it is that we'll never get
[1:25:36] out of the case of the Fall that because
[1:25:39] of Adams because of out of sin that
[1:25:41] we're going to stay here in this
[1:25:42] condition we'll be here in this
[1:25:43] condition but all of the prophecies that
[1:25:46] was laying there throughout all of the
[1:25:48] Old Testament was wrapped up in one man
[1:25:50] our Lord Jesus Christ and what did he do
[1:25:54] he embodied the very heart of the father
[1:25:57] and the father wanted some children that
[1:26:00] he could call his own so he reversed the
[1:26:02] curse of the devil in your life and he
[1:26:05] redeems you he brought you back what is
[1:26:08] he he is the greater Boaz
[1:26:11] if you look at Ruth what did Boaz do he
[1:26:15] rolled back the title of Ruth the
[1:26:17] moabitus and he gave her the title of
[1:26:20] Ruth the redeemed that's why William
[1:26:22] Branham said I'll not call you church
[1:26:25] I'll call your bride because he was not
[1:26:27] looking at a church body he was looking
[1:26:30] at the redeemed
[1:26:32] what he saw in the Pentecostal
[1:26:34] organization what's greater in the pride
[1:26:37] what he saw out there in a charismatic
[1:26:40] move was greater in the pride they might
[1:26:43] have portions of it but this is the ad
[1:26:46] this is the return of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:56] he was
[1:26:57] the fullness of the godhead body
[1:27:01] but you make up
[1:27:02] all of him
[1:27:04] what is this this is the bride coming of
[1:27:08] Christ
[1:27:10] it was once in one man but now it's in a
[1:27:14] many member bride
[1:27:16] he said the words that I do shall you do
[1:27:20] also
[1:27:21] but greater
[1:27:23] look at your neighbor say greater
[1:27:26] but greater than these that's how you do
[1:27:29] what am I saying to you that the greater
[1:27:33] is here in the latter
[1:27:35] that where you are standing at is
[1:27:37] everything
[1:27:39] that God dreamed of
[1:27:43] filled in his mind they architect
[1:27:45] himself seen you here the architect
[1:27:47] designed you being here
[1:27:50] foreign
[1:27:52] I'm not too much of a builder
[1:27:56] I'm more of a demolisher
[1:28:00] but there's some brothers here that have
[1:28:01] some real gifts
[1:28:03] to be able to put some things together
[1:28:06] it was not chosen my lot in life to be
[1:28:08] that
[1:28:10] but
[1:28:12] you know that's right
[1:28:14] but you know that
[1:28:16] when a sisters got her house lined out
[1:28:19] she's got the blueprint in front of her
[1:28:24] pray for a good marriage right there
[1:28:28] good
[1:28:29] some of you know
[1:28:31] some of you young people are going to
[1:28:32] figure it out
[1:28:34] but when she's got this house designed
[1:28:37] exactly to her speculation she's dreamed
[1:28:40] of it she's thought of it
[1:28:43] it's a terrible thing when she said well
[1:28:45] I didn't turn out the way I wanted it
[1:28:48] you know what that cost you an extra
[1:28:49] thirty thousand dollars
[1:28:53] but when
[1:28:55] but when God goes to design it
[1:28:58] he knows exactly what it's going to look
[1:29:00] like
[1:29:00] he's not surprised by the peace that he
[1:29:04] had to chisel down
[1:29:07] he had to work on them it seemed like
[1:29:09] they was never going to get it but they
[1:29:11] were the missing piece
[1:29:13] he knew where they were going to fit in
[1:29:15] at
[1:29:18] say when God the great artist looks at
[1:29:19] it said
[1:29:22] it's even better than I thought it was
[1:29:24] going to be like
[1:29:25] can you imagine I've designed this
[1:29:28] building so that she'll talk like me
[1:29:31] that she'll dress like me she'll act
[1:29:33] like me she'll do the works like me I
[1:29:37] tell you she's so much like me
[1:29:39] it's like I'm looking at the word it's
[1:29:42] like I'm looking at myself
[1:29:47] you know when you go through Galatians
[1:29:49] chapter 4 and you look at the adoption
[1:29:51] process that when the father sends out
[1:29:53] the tutor he sends a tutor with a son
[1:29:55] and the tutor comes back and he gives
[1:29:57] him word he's just like his daddy he
[1:30:00] looks like his daddy he operates like
[1:30:03] his daddy you can send him out into the
[1:30:05] field he's over your inheritance he
[1:30:08] thinks like you
[1:30:11] the father knows
[1:30:13] the father knows because you are in his
[1:30:16] paternal inheritance he knows that you
[1:30:19] won't do anything outside of his word
[1:30:26] I see what it does
[1:30:28] by you looking at this
[1:30:31] you say I appreciate your collapse
[1:30:34] I appreciate your excitement
[1:30:36] I appreciate you getting getting moved
[1:30:39] by the word
[1:30:41] but what I appreciate is you saying Amen
[1:30:44] to the word
[1:30:46] because even though it seems cutting and
[1:30:50] though it seems like it's hurting your
[1:30:52] body if you can say Amen to it it's
[1:30:55] bringing your body under subjection and
[1:30:57] William Branham said in the token
[1:30:59] message that full obedience through the
[1:31:01] word of God entitles you to the Token so
[1:31:04] I appreciate you getting excited but let
[1:31:06] your excitement be because of your amen
[1:31:09] let it be because you believe that this
[1:31:12] is exactly that then so be it if he's
[1:31:15] preaching on me so be it Lord if he's
[1:31:18] cutting at me so be it Lord the reason
[1:31:21] why we are in a church that is a mature
[1:31:24] church is because we know what the word
[1:31:27] is and we know what it does and we can
[1:31:30] say Amen
[1:31:35] foreign
[1:31:39] you see when that Passover was happening
[1:31:44] what did they do
[1:31:46] they had to lay their hand upon the
[1:31:48] sacrifice to identify themselves with
[1:31:50] the sacrifice
[1:31:53] because you see the blood of bulls and
[1:31:55] goats was a covering for them it was a
[1:31:57] religion for them at the time that's
[1:32:00] what religion is it's a covering
[1:32:02] but you see they had something they had
[1:32:04] something there that would lay upon all
[1:32:06] of the sins of their life
[1:32:09] but they would go out with the same
[1:32:10] nature but there was coming one
[1:32:13] you see what they were seeing in part
[1:32:15] you are now seeing in the supreme power
[1:32:18] of the supernatural you see what they
[1:32:21] were seeing in part you are seeing in
[1:32:22] full you see because you have a
[1:32:24] supernatural Supreme token and what did
[1:32:28] this token do it placed us as the
[1:32:30] manifested Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:32:33] has brought us back to the adoptions of
[1:32:35] sons that now are we the sons of God you
[1:32:38] see what that token is that token is our
[1:32:41] identification that we have believed God
[1:32:44] and God has accepted us
[1:32:47] it's not us saying I believe your word
[1:32:49] it's not just us sitting there and
[1:32:51] saying Amen to it but God is saying amen
[1:32:53] back to your faith
[1:32:55] you see if you've got the very token
[1:32:57] life of almighty God upon you God is
[1:32:59] saying I am a man in your faith
[1:33:02] this is what I wish
[1:33:04] I wish I could have one of them gifts
[1:33:06] like like brother rohan's got a gift of
[1:33:09] knowledge or a gift to discernment or
[1:33:11] the gift of speaking in tongues if
[1:33:12] you've got the gift of faith you are in
[1:33:15] the body
[1:33:16] you can sit there and say Amen to the
[1:33:18] word of God stop looking for something
[1:33:21] else say Amen to it
[1:33:23] stop wishing for somebody else's gifts
[1:33:26] you'll operate out of your power but if
[1:33:28] you can say Amen to it and live in the
[1:33:31] gift of your faith
[1:33:33] you'll operate the word in your position
[1:33:45] Hallelujah
[1:33:46] Hallelujah somebody say hallelujah
[1:33:51] brother random told us he said now he
[1:33:54] said when a man takes that inspired word
[1:33:56] and he reads that inspired word he said
[1:33:59] them two Inspirations come together and
[1:34:02] it brings about her result so when you
[1:34:04] read the inspired word and you say Amen
[1:34:07] to the inspired word and you get
[1:34:08] inspired to believe that it's going to
[1:34:11] bring about a result just like when
[1:34:13] Moses he got inspired to run under the
[1:34:16] message of Abraham that thy seed would
[1:34:19] sojourn in a Strange Land he got under
[1:34:21] the inspiration of Abraham's Covenant
[1:34:24] and he took a people right on to the to
[1:34:28] the promised land
[1:34:32] have a good time by myself up here but
[1:34:35] when shamgar got under the inspiration
[1:34:38] when he got on the inspiration that he
[1:34:41] was under the Abraham Covenant of
[1:34:43] circumcision he recognized that the
[1:34:45] Bible said that want to put a flight a
[1:34:47] thousand so he got under the inspiration
[1:34:50] of it and he killed 600 devils
[1:34:54] he said well I'm facing more than a
[1:34:55] thousand let me join up with your team
[1:34:57] because I want to put a flight a
[1:34:59] thousand and two ten thousand it doesn't
[1:35:01] matter what you're facing we are a broad
[1:35:04] body under the inspiration of Malachi 4
[1:35:07] under the restoration of the word of the
[1:35:09] hour and we call black black and white
[1:35:12] white let me tell you ain't got a
[1:35:15] promise message up you ain't gotta pump
[1:35:17] this message up you ain't gotta sing it
[1:35:19] up you ain't gotta tune it up just
[1:35:21] preach it like it is and let it settle
[1:35:23] where it is Satan will have to do what
[1:35:26] he's got to do
[1:35:27] I'm not pumping you up by my voice it's
[1:35:30] the voice of almighty God that is
[1:35:33] calling you to come up a little bit
[1:35:34] higher
[1:35:45] well I don't understand
[1:35:47] I don't understand why things are this
[1:35:49] way we're under the inspiration of it
[1:35:55] you don't understand why things are
[1:35:56] going like they are but there's somebody
[1:35:58] that's laid out that is on
[1:36:03] why is this one this way why is this one
[1:36:05] sick
[1:36:06] why am I going through this
[1:36:09] the latter shall be greater than the
[1:36:12] former
[1:36:15] he's still Jesus
[1:36:18] he's still on the throne
[1:36:20] he's still away maker
[1:36:23] let me say this to you that the glory
[1:36:26] that Moses and Heron fellowshipped with
[1:36:28] was in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:36:32] let me tell you if he was not the
[1:36:34] Shekinah Glory if the glory of the
[1:36:36] father did not dwell on the inside of
[1:36:38] Jesus blind Bartimaeus would still be
[1:36:41] blind
[1:36:42] jairus's daughter would still be dead
[1:36:44] Lazarus would still be dead the water
[1:36:46] would still be water instead of wine
[1:36:48] come on somebody the 5000 would still be
[1:36:51] hungry the leper would still be known as
[1:36:53] a leprous man if if he was if he was who
[1:36:57] he says he was he had the ability to
[1:36:59] come the storms and to walk upon it but
[1:37:02] if he didn't if he was not the Shekinah
[1:37:04] he just sunk right there and the storm
[1:37:07] would have stayed in a place but because
[1:37:09] he's still Jesus Devin's sitting here
[1:37:12] Jason Smith sitting here Melissa Hill is
[1:37:15] still sitting here because he's still
[1:37:17] the begotten of the father and he's full
[1:37:20] of grace and he's full of truth because
[1:37:23] he still is Jesus
[1:37:28] you wouldn't be here without his glory
[1:37:30] you wouldn't be in the picture without
[1:37:33] his power but because of his power the
[1:37:37] latter shall be greater
[1:37:42] Hallelujah
[1:37:45] Hallelujah
[1:37:49] this is beyond human limitations you
[1:37:52] shouldn't be here by human standards but
[1:37:55] we're not following a Methodist move
[1:37:56] we're not following a Wesleyan move
[1:37:59] we're not following Azusa Pentecostal
[1:38:01] move this is beyond that this is the
[1:38:05] restoration of the word
[1:38:15] I want you to think how far you want to
[1:38:17] get
[1:38:19] in this life I want you to think about
[1:38:21] how far you want to get
[1:38:24] I want you to think about how far you
[1:38:25] want to get in your financial status
[1:38:28] you forgive me just for a minute but I'm
[1:38:29] going to get to you on your level for
[1:38:31] one way you think about where you're at
[1:38:33] in your financial status think about
[1:38:36] where you are as a family think about
[1:38:37] where you are in a natural and God will
[1:38:40] go beyond your human limitations
[1:38:42] you see when the meal was running out
[1:38:44] and the oil was out he went beyond her
[1:38:47] human limitations let me tell you when
[1:38:50] the oil had run out in the Pentecostal
[1:38:52] movement he said I am the god that
[1:38:54] restores you see you can expect certain
[1:38:57] things but God will do greater than what
[1:38:59] you're expecting
[1:39:02] you can expect a certain way for your
[1:39:04] Miracle to come but he's going to do it
[1:39:06] greater than You're Expecting I want to
[1:39:08] say to you what you're expecting it's
[1:39:11] going to be greater
[1:39:13] I'm expecting Erica Parker to be
[1:39:15] completely healed but it's going to be
[1:39:16] greater than I can imagine I am
[1:39:18] expecting Ron Spencer to completely walk
[1:39:21] out of cancer but it's going to be
[1:39:23] greater than I could ever imagine I'm
[1:39:25] expecting this bride to go but it's
[1:39:28] going to be greater than I can imagine
[1:39:32] because it's beyond my human limitations
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:43] let me tell you
[1:39:45] if you're still trying to catch up with
[1:39:47] me you're riding on a horse and buggy
[1:39:50] come on somebody I'm not trying to
[1:39:52] preach to you some Pentecostal Jubilee
[1:39:55] where I pump you up sing you up it'll
[1:39:58] only take you into the skies but I'm
[1:40:00] preaching to you something that'll take
[1:40:02] you beyond the heavenlies it'll take you
[1:40:05] further than man's ever went and preach
[1:40:07] to he preaching to you an astronaut's
[1:40:10] age message
[1:40:12] let me tell you where you are walking
[1:40:14] the methodists have never walked
[1:40:18] well you're walking the Mennonites have
[1:40:20] never walked
[1:40:22] forgive me
[1:40:23] forgive me if I hurt your feelings but
[1:40:26] what the what the Mennonites had what
[1:40:28] the Brethren had what the westlings had
[1:40:30] what the lutherans had when all of them
[1:40:33] denominations had or never put you in a
[1:40:35] rapture
[1:40:36] because it's full of ideas and it's
[1:40:38] worth full of theology but this message
[1:40:41] is straight from the Throne of God
[1:40:44] if this message is wrong then all
[1:40:47] Christianity is wrong this message is
[1:40:51] the bodyman of Jesus Christ
[1:40:59] did God take his picture with in this
[1:41:01] day he didn't take it with John Smith he
[1:41:04] didn't take it with the denominations of
[1:41:05] the world he took it with your message
[1:41:09] it's this pillar fire that'll lead you
[1:41:11] beyond human limitations
[1:41:15] Hallelujah you see the children of
[1:41:17] Israel thought they were going this way
[1:41:19] but the pillar of fire took them that
[1:41:21] way and you thought you were going this
[1:41:23] way to your rapture but God says no I'm
[1:41:25] taking you further
[1:41:34] foreign
[1:41:39] but I got critics
[1:41:42] let me tell you the most criticized
[1:41:45] being in the room is the pillar of Fire
[1:41:49] sister Rachel it's the most criticized
[1:41:51] thing in this room and it's a pillar of
[1:41:53] Fire
[1:41:56] and when men are criticize it and when
[1:41:58] men make fun of it
[1:42:00] he will back up what he said
[1:42:06] you remember the FBI agents you remember
[1:42:08] what they were trying to act like they
[1:42:10] were trying to cause they were trying to
[1:42:12] cause I ain't show them they were trying
[1:42:15] to cause a showdown of fire and the
[1:42:17] pillar fire showed up
[1:42:19] you see there was men back there that
[1:42:20] was impersonating the FBI or trying to
[1:42:23] say that the FBI was coming to expose
[1:42:25] William Branham as a Divine healer as a
[1:42:27] false prophet but he stood there he said
[1:42:30] it ain't the FBI it's them two
[1:42:32] backslidden preachers back there once in
[1:42:35] a gray suit and one's in a blue suit if
[1:42:37] they'd have come down to there to that
[1:42:39] pulpit and stood where William Branham
[1:42:41] stood at that had been two men carried
[1:42:43] out that night
[1:42:47] you can criticize this but the pillar of
[1:42:50] fire will show up
[1:42:54] let me tell you we are not great he's
[1:42:57] the one that is great
[1:42:59] if you're looking at the man William
[1:43:01] Branham and you're saying that he's the
[1:43:03] great one you are missing a picture
[1:43:06] it's a pill or fire in the picture that
[1:43:08] is the great one what is that that's our
[1:43:11] headship that's our intellect where are
[1:43:14] you getting this material at well
[1:43:15] brother Andrew I'm getting
[1:43:18] I ain't getting it from Jeffersonville I
[1:43:21] ain't getting it from Rome but I'm
[1:43:22] getting it straight from the Throne of
[1:43:24] God
[1:43:24] [Music]
[1:43:26] [Applause]
[1:43:31] Pentecost thought they had a great
[1:43:33] movement in 1906 but they
[1:43:35] denominationalize it and they organized
[1:43:37] it and put a fence around it but God
[1:43:40] says I'm not done yet
[1:43:47] I said well I don't want none of that ax
[1:43:50] too 38.
[1:43:53] I don't want none of them screaming
[1:43:55] blabbering hollering youngins
[1:43:58] it shows what kind you are
[1:44:03] because well I don't want that kind of
[1:44:05] stirring up or emotion in my church
[1:44:12] you know something
[1:44:13] somebody's got to be an idiot
[1:44:21] I mean I I'm a little bit partial to
[1:44:23] this guy back here
[1:44:25] but I just want to say something I feel
[1:44:27] like we're under some of the greatest
[1:44:29] training that we should be
[1:44:32] you're not just some schoolgirl
[1:44:35] that don't know what she's doing you've
[1:44:37] been well trained you've been well
[1:44:39] taught
[1:44:42] and you know what I have enough faith in
[1:44:44] this guy right back here
[1:44:46] that if we did get out of order
[1:44:49] he'd come and put us in order
[1:44:55] but the problem with so many people and
[1:44:58] so many people want to sit around the
[1:44:59] outskirts of the message they never had
[1:45:02] a restoration so they can't have a
[1:45:04] fulfillment
[1:45:05] so they gotta sit back and say well we
[1:45:07] gotta we gotta hold our people back
[1:45:09] because if I'll tell you what I'll tell
[1:45:11] you what if we let them get over there
[1:45:12] where the grass is really green at we'll
[1:45:14] never hold them in with a fence don't
[1:45:16] you worry if you built the fence God
[1:45:18] will get them out
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:20] [Music]
[1:45:22] God is the one that built this message
[1:45:24] God is the one that sent this message I
[1:45:27] don't care if I got us grow in tongues
[1:45:29] scream in tongues I don't care what I
[1:45:31] gotta do let me do exactly what is
[1:45:34] predestined in this hour to do
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:51] I just come to see if it's really real
[1:45:54] I'll say like Jesus said come and see
[1:46:01] you won't be the last Gentile that he
[1:46:04] shows himself to
[1:46:08] but let me point you to the first one
[1:46:10] that he showed himself to
[1:46:12] she was simply looking for a crumb
[1:46:18] and maybe you're looking for a crumb
[1:46:20] from the master's table
[1:46:24] and he's called you out
[1:46:28] said I have no part with you bunch of
[1:46:30] dogs
[1:46:33] right do you still want what he's got
[1:46:38] when he tells you that the way that
[1:46:40] you're living
[1:46:41] is not my kind of living do you still
[1:46:43] want what he's got
[1:46:48] let me tell you let me tell you
[1:46:50] something Jesus
[1:46:51] my daughter is sick with the Devil
[1:46:54] she's sick with the devil I'm not asking
[1:46:57] for a full plate from you I'm simply
[1:47:00] asking for a crumb
[1:47:02] because I know that if I get one little
[1:47:04] piece from you
[1:47:06] it will be everything that I have need
[1:47:08] of Jesus himself couldn't push this
[1:47:12] siren information woman away from him he
[1:47:15] couldn't push her away from him when
[1:47:17] Jesus can't push you away how in the
[1:47:20] world can the devil try to push you away
[1:47:27] I just won one piece
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:32] come all the way up here for one piece
[1:47:36] let me tell you if you get one piece
[1:47:38] it's worth it
[1:47:40] and when you get this one piece you're
[1:47:42] going to be criticized you're going to
[1:47:44] be talked about
[1:47:45] you're going to be made fun of
[1:47:48] you remember when you left the house she
[1:47:50] was having one of them fits she was over
[1:47:52] there throwing herself in a temper
[1:47:53] tantrum rolling around
[1:47:57] well let me tell you when I give her
[1:47:58] this crumb she's going to do the same
[1:47:59] exact thing but it'll be under a
[1:48:01] different spirit
[1:48:02] [Applause]
[1:48:06] what is it then people can't see that
[1:48:09] he's behind them Badger skins and they
[1:48:11] call them a bunch of holy rollers but
[1:48:13] it's the same El Shady eye that was back
[1:48:16] there with Abraham
[1:48:18] that was up there with Abraham and had a
[1:48:21] conversation with Abraham and he started
[1:48:23] talking to him
[1:48:34] what this Angel wants to deposit we'll
[1:48:37] give you enough faith that you can go
[1:48:39] through the truth you can go through the
[1:48:40] worst of tiles you can go through
[1:48:42] tribulations in this world but what the
[1:48:45] angel is depositing to you
[1:48:48] you might be walking back with a crowd
[1:48:50] and somebody says do you really think
[1:48:53] that what he's given you is enough to
[1:48:55] take care of her
[1:48:59] amen
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:03] people might talk about you the way that
[1:49:05] you drive an hour and a half to get here
[1:49:07] but it's worth it when you get a crumb
[1:49:11] from the master table it's everything
[1:49:13] you have need of
[1:49:14] [Applause]
[1:49:18] when she got back to her home
[1:49:25] she said
[1:49:26] you know what
[1:49:27] the latter is greater than the former
[1:49:35] when my wife got a new husband
[1:49:39] she said the latter is greater than the
[1:49:41] former
[1:49:48] I got a pretty look I got a pretty good
[1:49:50] idea of what the message is
[1:49:52] you get the Holy Ghost the latter is
[1:49:55] greater
[1:49:56] than the former
[1:50:01] you say you got to get to a spot
[1:50:03] that you can let yourself go
[1:50:08] you got to let go
[1:50:10] and you got to let God
[1:50:16] because this is beyond what you think
[1:50:19] I ain't preaching to you some Hocus
[1:50:21] Pocus
[1:50:22] I'm preaching to you about the one
[1:50:24] that's in the room
[1:50:27] he is my provider
[1:50:30] he is my satisfying portion he is my
[1:50:34] everything
[1:50:35] I'm not trying to get you to think about
[1:50:37] something or let your mind drift off
[1:50:39] because that's where you're going to get
[1:50:41] in trouble is when you let your mind get
[1:50:43] off at just drifting off you're setting
[1:50:46] yourself up for an evil spirit but what
[1:50:48] I'm trying to get you to do is open up
[1:50:51] your soul realm to accept
[1:50:54] that the father is here
[1:50:58] you gotta let go
[1:51:01] and let God
[1:51:03] parents
[1:51:06] stop trying to make them get it
[1:51:09] and let go and let God
[1:51:12] I believe in keeping a standard I
[1:51:14] believe in setting the standards
[1:51:16] but when the enemy comes in like a flood
[1:51:19] who's the one that raises the standard
[1:51:21] not you God
[1:51:27] you gotta let go
[1:51:30] with your own life
[1:51:32] stop trying to figure it out
[1:51:36] stop trying to make yourself do
[1:51:38] something that you weren't destined to
[1:51:40] do brother Branham said he said you take
[1:51:42] that little fishy he said he has the
[1:51:44] ability to drop all the way down into
[1:51:46] the ocean
[1:51:48] he has a law there that allows him to
[1:51:51] let himself go to it
[1:51:54] and he can sink all the way down he said
[1:51:56] but if he takes the wrong perspective I
[1:51:58] said well I'll tell you what I got to do
[1:51:59] I gotta run up there on top of the water
[1:52:01] and I got to get me a great big gulp of
[1:52:03] oxygen
[1:52:05] he said what he'll do he'll try to sink
[1:52:07] down and he'll blow up
[1:52:11] but he just lets himself go to it
[1:52:14] he said the bird don't think I gotta go
[1:52:16] take off running and running at it
[1:52:18] and then I'll just take off but he's got
[1:52:20] all that controls him
[1:52:22] you and I don't have that long
[1:52:24] I wish we did
[1:52:26] that'd be pretty cool wouldn't it
[1:52:28] you imagine me preaching with that kind
[1:52:30] of law
[1:52:31] I'll be at the back with brother Adam
[1:52:33] before you know it
[1:52:34] what'd he do he just let go and let God
[1:52:40] he said but what you've got to do is
[1:52:43] you've got to let go
[1:52:45] and you've got to let God do it
[1:52:49] sometimes we just want to control it and
[1:52:51] work it all out
[1:52:52] get all the details fixed out
[1:52:55] and sit back and say well God didn't I
[1:52:57] do a nice job and he says
[1:53:02] I ain't the way I drawed it up
[1:53:06] I'll tell you if we had our way
[1:53:10] man we come into heaven
[1:53:12] we'd be wearing our three-piece suit our
[1:53:15] hair would be just perfectly right
[1:53:18] where'd they come from they must just
[1:53:21] step out a magazine they sure didn't
[1:53:23] come out of layout say it that way
[1:53:27] but God has a way of letting us go
[1:53:30] through some real stuff
[1:53:33] he lets this one get diagnosed with this
[1:53:34] way he lets this one get diagnosed with
[1:53:36] this way
[1:53:37] but he's got this brother over here
[1:53:39] that's praying for this history over
[1:53:41] here
[1:53:43] and when you come to get on the Chariot
[1:53:44] with the King
[1:53:46] you had to let go to fight
[1:53:48] you had to let go to get on
[1:53:52] my brother random said when you let go
[1:53:54] he'll bring you to your healing
[1:53:56] he'll bring you to your miracle
[1:53:59] he said he'll bring you to any of his
[1:54:01] promises when you let go
[1:54:04] and let God
[1:54:06] brother Andrew
[1:54:10] I was really hoping that you'd preach to
[1:54:12] us at seven seal tonight I just did
[1:54:19] you mean it's that simple
[1:54:21] what is it it's the token life of Jesus
[1:54:24] Christ operating through a third pole
[1:54:26] Ministry and a bride that says let go
[1:54:33] what William Branham do he didn't he
[1:54:36] didn't set them things up
[1:54:39] he said then things were sovereignly
[1:54:41] given
[1:54:44] he said he spoke to me
[1:54:47] what are you out here hunting for
[1:54:49] and he's been speaking to your heart
[1:54:51] what are you here hunting for
[1:54:54] some of you come here hunting for a
[1:54:56] crumb
[1:54:57] and you got it
[1:55:01] he said he's done more in my little
[1:55:03] humble Ministry than he did in his own
[1:55:05] he said he took those he took those
[1:55:07] those five fish in those two loaves and
[1:55:10] he broke peace after peace after peace
[1:55:12] he said but in my Ministry
[1:55:15] he took something that was not there
[1:55:18] and put it there
[1:55:21] what is he asking you to do
[1:55:24] Let Yourself Go
[1:55:26] Let Yourself Go to the message
[1:55:29] stop getting your idea of what you think
[1:55:31] it's got to be Let Yourself Go
[1:55:34] I'm not saying let yourself go to Every
[1:55:36] wind of Doctrine and just blow all over

[2:09:25] sometimes it ain't
[2:09:29] and there was material on top of
[2:09:31] material that got erased
[2:09:33] just completely gone
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:37] I'm the kind of guy that
[2:09:39] when I look at a scripture I look at it
[2:09:41] in three angles
[2:09:42] I look at it the way God looks at it I
[2:09:44] look at the way the humans look at it
[2:09:45] and look at the way that Satan looks at
[2:09:47] it
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:49] and I was building some points on those
[2:09:51] things
[2:09:53] I come back and I don't understand all
[2:09:55] that but all of them points that was
[2:09:57] laying there was completely gone
[2:09:58] couldn't see it couldn't find it it was
[2:10:01] gone
[2:10:02] but while the preaching was going on he
[2:10:04] brought all of it out
[2:10:08] and I got a pretty good memory but
[2:10:10] there's no way that I can remember
[2:10:11] everything that he put there and Satan
[2:10:13] tried to get rid of it
[2:10:15] say what you want to or not I know what
[2:10:18] he's done in this service
[2:10:20] I know
[2:10:21] and you can question in your own
[2:10:23] imagination right here or whether I'm
[2:10:24] telling you the truth or not but you
[2:10:26] just had to take me at his word I know
[2:10:28] what happened in this service
[2:10:30] I know who was standing right there
[2:10:33] I know
[2:10:35] and I know that when he does something
[2:10:37] he's doing it for you
[2:10:41] he's not doing this for me he's doing
[2:10:43] this for you
[2:10:45] I want you to understand
[2:10:48] you may not understand this fully right
[2:10:50] now but I want to say this to you that
[2:10:52] the glory
[2:10:54] of the latter part of your life
[2:10:56] [Music]
[2:10:59] is going to be greater
[2:11:01] than the first part of your life
[2:11:04] sing it with us today
[2:11:06] Hallelujah
[2:11:10] just for your spirit out on me
[2:11:17] and for just my grace
