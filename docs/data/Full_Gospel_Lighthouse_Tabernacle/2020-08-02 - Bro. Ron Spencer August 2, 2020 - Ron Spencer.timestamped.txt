[0:41] and there is another little door of
[0:44] pride oh that sure is a great door in
[0:48] the human heart
[0:49] in this 20th century people want to feel
[0:52] like if they're just somebody
[0:56] i just want you to stop a minute and
[0:59] take analysis who are you anyhow
[1:03] do you think the world would stop
[1:05] turning if you died tonight
[1:08] do you think it was weary god or the
[1:11] angels or
[1:12] so forth maybe in two days from now if
[1:14] you're a very important man you'll never
[1:16] be known anymore just among your
[1:18] relations
[1:19] you know how long ago i was standing it
[1:22] i love
[1:23] art and i like to see where the
[1:26] sculptures have
[1:27] made great artistic work and painters
[1:31] and so forth and i was at a certain
[1:34] museum
[1:34] in tennessee and there was a
[1:38] two young man saying they're looking at
[1:40] a
[1:41] a paper that was laying with the little
[1:44] difference of stuff
[1:45] material i'm one of the boys
[1:48] looked at it you turn back to come here
[1:51] john and look at
[1:53] i was looking over the boy's shoulders
[1:55] reading i was given the analysis
[1:58] of a male which is more valuable in
[2:00] weight
[2:01] and so forth than the female and a man
[2:04] weighing 150 pounds you know what he's
[2:08] worth
[2:08] 84 cents
[2:12] and then you'll put a hundred dollars to
[2:15] a
[2:15] 50 hat on your 84 cents
[2:20] and some of your women will take a five
[2:22] hundred dollar mentor
[2:24] and go to church on easter morning with
[2:26] a little certain
[2:27] body sticking up with your nose doesn't
[2:29] have any rain it will drown you
[2:31] and then what are you worth 84
[2:34] cents oh you think you're pretty
[2:39] but remember thou cometh spain
[2:42] you may be pretty but you'll be nothing
[2:45] but the skin worms will crawl in and out
[2:47] of that flesh
[2:49] and maybe by this time next week it'll
[2:52] be doing that
[2:54] you know what i mean oh you say mr
[2:57] graham i'm going to face you here in the
[2:59] city
[3:00] somebody else will take your place
[3:03] you'll be forgotten
[3:04] when the worms are eating you up
[3:08] and this certain boy said he heard he
[3:11] said sean
[3:11] we're not worth very much are we so
[3:14] don't look like we are we'd have to wait
[3:15] 150 pounds to be worth 84 cents
[3:19] so they were standing there and i tapped
[3:21] them on the shoulder i said
[3:23] boys pardon me just a minute
[3:26] i said i was looking to it that's
[3:28] because
[3:30] i remained i said i'm under 150 pounds
[3:34] but i said there's just one thing i
[3:37] wanted to tell you
[3:38] that this you may not even be
[3:42] worth 84 in chemicals with your body
[3:44] just enough all white wash just frankly
[3:47] hence nests and a little bit of
[3:48] polyester and so forth you might not be
[3:52] worth 84
[3:53] cents but you've got to soar into this
[3:57] work
[3:57] 10 million worlds
[4:00] [Music]
[4:09] and the good thing about it friends is
[4:11] think of this before we get to this
[4:13] kingdom before
[4:14] this king comes now we can sit together
[4:17] in
[4:17] heavenly places in christ jesus
[4:20] lifted up above all the shadows of all
[4:23] the corruption of the world and all
[4:25] their television programs and
[4:26] all these other nonsenses they got on
[4:28] the earth today and all their rotten
[4:30] pollution and systems and everything
[4:31] be lifted up into heavenly places and
[4:34] the holy spirit himself come upon us and
[4:36] speak out and
[4:37] call to us our sins and tell us how to
[4:39] get straightened up and what we've done
[4:40] in life and what we're doing
[4:42] it's the holy spirit jesus christ the
[4:44] same yesterday today and forever
[4:46] that's the king that shall come to his
[4:47] kingdom someday and his kingdom

[1:14:05] stand before thee
[1:14:07] all the days of thy life god is saying
[1:14:10] this
[1:14:12] not his favorite preacher god is saying
[1:14:15] this
[1:14:16] as i was with moses so i will be with
[1:14:19] thee
[1:14:20] i will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:14:24] be strong and of good courage for unto
[1:14:28] this people
[1:14:29] shalt thou provide for an inheritance
[1:14:32] the land
[1:14:32] which i swear unto their fathers to give
[1:14:36] them
[1:14:36] may the lord bless the reading of his
[1:14:39] word today
[1:14:40] you may be seated
[1:14:49] brother branham says in in from the
[1:14:52] beginning it wasn't so
[1:14:54] he said then today they they have the
[1:14:57] nerve to say
[1:14:59] we where wonder what happened to the
[1:15:03] to the god of the bible where is that
[1:15:06] god
[1:15:07] why you have choked him out by your
[1:15:09] creeds and
[1:15:10] choked him out by your traditions and
[1:15:13] and we tried to place him back in
[1:15:15] history
[1:15:16] he is a god of history
[1:15:19] and he's waiting today on today
[1:15:23] that that same god of history that when
[1:15:25] moses called on him
[1:15:27] at the red sea the god of history rose
[1:15:30] and made a way
[1:15:31] when joshua called on the god of history
[1:15:34] he said god he said he rose up and made
[1:15:38] a way
[1:15:39] when daniel called on him in a fiery
[1:15:42] furnace
[1:15:42] he made a way or in the lion's den
[1:15:45] he said the hebrew children he said he
[1:15:48] made a way
[1:15:49] he's still the same god of history how
[1:15:52] many believes that
[1:15:54] he's still that same god he's the same
[1:15:58] he's the same god of history he's
[1:16:00] waiting for
[1:16:01] his people
[1:16:05] how many of his people are here this
[1:16:07] morning he's waiting for his people
[1:16:11] to call him out of history
[1:16:14] that godfrey still remains god
[1:16:17] he's god forever
[1:16:21] but our traditions we've taught it
[1:16:24] away from the people what we must do
[1:16:28] is bring back that living faith
[1:16:33] to a people bring
[1:16:37] god back
[1:16:40] that's a 1959 quote this church
[1:16:44] has seen god a living god
[1:16:50] we've seen him do almost every
[1:16:54] major miracle that you can find
[1:16:57] we've seen him in phenomenal situations
[1:17:00] i love last night god loves to put his
[1:17:04] war
[1:17:04] armor on for his children
[1:17:09] he said oh how the church ought to to
[1:17:11] look this morning to find the spirit
[1:17:14] working amongst the people if you want a
[1:17:16] church
[1:17:17] home that the spirit that's raised
[1:17:20] christ from the dead
[1:17:21] the holy spirit that will move amongst
[1:17:24] the people
[1:17:25] that's the spirit that's the spirit that
[1:17:28] god
[1:17:29] is raised up in the last days to take a
[1:17:32] people over
[1:17:33] into the other land into the full
[1:17:36] promise
[1:17:37] of all the blessings of god to the
[1:17:39] commission that he gave
[1:17:41] the promise the is unto you and to your
[1:17:45] children
[1:17:48] as israel sought for that promised land
[1:17:51] knowing
[1:17:51] that it was somewhere because there had
[1:17:54] been
[1:17:54] somebody there before so
[1:17:58] is the church we know that there's a
[1:18:00] land somewhere
[1:18:02] there's a power somewhere because that's
[1:18:04] been
[1:18:05] oh others over there we know that
[1:18:09] land lays beyond the river
[1:18:13] where we're headed towards this morning
[1:18:17] trying to go to that promised land
[1:18:20] joshua knew that that land was there
[1:18:24] and he went first and found out and he
[1:18:26] come back as a witness
[1:18:28] god called ministers ought not to have
[1:18:31] to be so stuffed and so
[1:18:33] full of theology but have it to visit
[1:18:36] the land
[1:18:37] to where we're going and bring back the
[1:18:40] evidence
[1:18:42] of the divine love and the power
[1:18:45] of jesus christ to make known to their
[1:18:49] congregations
[1:18:50] that there is a land beyond the river
[1:18:56] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:01] aaron oglesby preached a sermon the
[1:19:03] other day and he
[1:19:04] i'd just like to just give a couple
[1:19:07] notes of
[1:19:08] highlights he is brother tim pruitt's
[1:19:10] son-in-law he is the one that
[1:19:12] was standing in the room when we had the
[1:19:15] vision of
[1:19:16] of little isaac
[1:19:20] and these are some of the statements and
[1:19:21] i thought it would be a blessing to you
[1:19:25] in one moment your whole world can be

[1:21:10] hallelujah bartimaeus was healed
[1:21:13] the blindness left him
[1:21:17] and he wasn't going to relive those days
[1:21:19] over again
[1:21:20] when you become a christian in your life
[1:21:23] and the grace of god
[1:21:25] is bestowed on your life and something
[1:21:27] becomes alive
[1:21:28] and it becomes surreal to you god found
[1:21:31] many of you with very stained lives
[1:21:35] many children of god come to god in deep
[1:21:40] trouble
[1:21:42] we once were drug addicts or we once
[1:21:44] were religious so we
[1:21:46] we once had a very stained past but when
[1:21:49] god rich in mercy
[1:21:51] and the blood of jesus christ washed our
[1:21:53] lives
[1:21:54] and took those desires away we're not
[1:21:57] going back
[1:21:58] [Applause]
[1:22:06] come on church we don't have to count
[1:22:09] the days to keep ourselves
[1:22:11] you know in line this is how long we've
[1:22:13] been sober or this is how long i haven't
[1:22:15] had drugs or
[1:22:16] this is how long i haven't done any
[1:22:18] pornography we met
[1:22:20] god and god changed your lives
[1:22:24] and we're not that man no longer so
[1:22:26] don't identify
[1:22:27] me as that man
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:36] hallelujah
[1:22:39] remember our god is still the god of
[1:22:40] elijah
[1:22:42] he's still the same god as he ever was
[1:22:45] he is the same god
[1:22:46] he moves in the same cycle he does the
[1:22:49] same things
[1:22:50] he is the same yesterday today and
[1:22:54] forever
[1:22:57] hallelujah now remember
[1:23:00] in the midst of all this cry god cannot
[1:23:02] send a revival until he's got men in
[1:23:05] shape to take it
[1:23:07] we cannot have a revival until we got
[1:23:09] men
[1:23:11] god called men god trained men that's
[1:23:13] not afraid
[1:23:15] not afraid not trained up in some
[1:23:17] schools of theology
[1:23:19] or education but rugged men of faith
[1:23:24] god has brought them up in a school of
[1:23:26] rugged training
[1:23:28] men who are not afraid to face the fire
[1:23:31] men who has come into the presence of
[1:23:34] god who knows his power
[1:23:36] knows his omnipotence knows his healing
[1:23:39] some man that's been trained to know the
[1:23:41] living god
[1:23:43] it's all right to train them by the word
[1:23:46] but the letter killeth but the spirit
[1:23:48] giveth love
[1:23:49] and before we can have a revival god has
[1:23:52] to call
[1:23:53] men and trained and god trained men
[1:23:57] to carry this message oh glory to god
[1:24:02] they don't care what the opposition is
[1:24:04] they're willing to go into the fiery
[1:24:07] furnace
[1:24:07] in defeat or a lion's den or whatever it
[1:24:10] may be
[1:24:11] they're ready to go because they've been
[1:24:13] in the presence of god
[1:24:16] they know what he is whether it's to
[1:24:18] victory or defeat they can still
[1:24:20] stand in the same that's the same the
[1:24:23] training that god does to men
[1:24:26] and it's just very strange to think that
[1:24:28] god would do that that
[1:24:30] god trains his men like that
[1:24:33] but he does
[1:24:36] some through the waters sunk through the
[1:24:39] floods
[1:24:40] some through deep trials but all
[1:24:44] through the blood god leads his men
[1:24:46] through
[1:24:47] great trials to purge them and sometimes
[1:24:50] it takes
[1:24:51] years to do it and as for myself i
[1:24:54] believe that
[1:24:55] right now that god is training such men
[1:24:58] to meet the front line men who are going
[1:25:01] through
[1:25:02] and time shook from their feet he says
[1:25:06] sometimes
[1:25:06] like the whole thing is falling but yet
[1:25:09] in the midst of it all
[1:25:10] they know that there's a living god
[1:25:16] oh hallelujah now notice this
[1:25:20] notice this grab a hold of it i'm
[1:25:22] grabbing a hold of it you grab a hold of
[1:25:23] it
[1:25:24] god's given every sick person

[1:26:39] favor with god
[1:26:44] god believes that you'll stand the test
[1:26:51] i don't know about you but i believe i
[1:26:53] could do some running
[1:26:58] because you can read a lot of names in
[1:27:00] the bible they stood the test
[1:27:02] but somebody is going to stand the test
[1:27:05] in
[1:27:05] this day
[1:27:07] [Applause]
[1:27:17] are you with me now i was thinking about
[1:27:20] you and i was reading this quote brother
[1:27:22] nathaniel
[1:27:23] he works in uva for those that will
[1:27:25] watch he works in uva
[1:27:27] he's on the coveted floor with at uva
[1:27:31] he's a icu nurse there and he said he
[1:27:35] noticed that when he laid his hands on
[1:27:38] them they would get better
[1:27:42] now let me just say this to you it's not
[1:27:44] just to the preacher standing in a
[1:27:46] pulpit
[1:27:48] but here is a man that that recognized
[1:27:51] in the midst of all of the chaos of this
[1:27:54] world
[1:27:54] that is going on when i lay my hands on
[1:27:58] them
[1:28:00] not having to say prayers and all
[1:28:02] different kinds of things but when he
[1:28:04] laid his hands on him
[1:28:05] are you with me can we can we take our
[1:28:08] footprints of possession
[1:28:10] and realize who we are
[1:28:13] whether you work in a bank or whether
[1:28:15] you work on construction
[1:28:17] let me just say god's with you
[1:28:21] he's watching over you you are his hands
[1:28:25] you are his feet you are his eyes
[1:28:36] hallelujah satan said oh sure he gets
[1:28:40] everything he asks for talking about job
[1:28:42] let me just go back
[1:28:50] he said job said oh yes i have seen job
[1:28:53] down there
[1:28:54] and god said he's a perfect servant
[1:28:57] there's none
[1:28:58] like him in the earth there's nobody
[1:29:00] like job
[1:29:01] he's a perfect man he's my pride and joy
[1:29:05] i like it god's got favorites too
[1:29:09] and satan said oh sure he he he
[1:29:12] he he gets everything that he asked for
[1:29:15] but let me have him once
[1:29:18] and i'll make him curse you to your face
[1:29:21] i'll make him curse you and god said
[1:29:24] he's in your hands
[1:29:27] but don't you take his life
[1:29:31] god had confidence
[1:29:35] in joke now let me just make something
[1:29:38] clear here
[1:29:39] it wasn't confidence in his dna flesh
[1:29:46] it was confidence in what god deposited
[1:29:49] on the inside so god's got confidence
[1:29:53] in himself
[1:29:57] or our glory how can we fail when god
[1:30:00] has confidence in himself
[1:30:02] of what he deposited
[1:30:07] he's able to take care of it
[1:30:11] when it looks like everything has gone
[1:30:13] wrong god's given you a trial
[1:30:15] he's got confidence he don't have to

[1:30:22] christian
[1:30:23] god's given you a test see what you'll
[1:30:26] do about it
[1:30:27] he said these fiery trials he says
[1:30:30] he said why count it all joy it's more
[1:30:34] precious than gold
[1:30:40] i want you to say that tonight my trials
[1:30:42] is more precious than gold
[1:30:50] he conquered sickness
[1:30:54] he conquered temptations when the enemy
[1:30:58] spit in his face and smote his jaw
[1:31:01] he turned the other side when they
[1:31:04] jerked his beard
[1:31:06] from his face and they spit on him he
[1:31:09] never revealed back
[1:31:11] he conquered the gate of temptation
[1:31:14] and took it when jesus conquered all of
[1:31:17] that
[1:31:20] he conquered that not only for himself
[1:31:24] but he conquered it for you
[1:31:29] but the brown said what an assurance of
[1:31:31] the solid rock the resurrection of our
[1:31:33] blessed lord
[1:31:35] he said nothing can destroy it
[1:31:40] glory to god it has been planted it is
[1:31:44] the seed of god
[1:31:45] it is the purpose of god to give us the
[1:31:47] blessed holy spirit
[1:31:49] it is the purpose of god to show us
[1:31:51] signs and wonders and miracles
[1:31:53] it's the purpose of god that nothing
[1:31:56] can destroy it all hell may wager
[1:32:00] against it
[1:32:01] but it will prevail
[1:32:05] we have god's eternal promise there may
[1:32:08] be teachers and
[1:32:09] isms rise they may be great programs
[1:32:11] rise there may be things that look like
[1:32:14] it would be destroyed
[1:32:15] but it can never be destroyed it is the
[1:32:18] purpose of god to see that it will
[1:32:20] prevail
[1:32:21] it's not up to me it's not
[1:32:26] up to you
[1:32:30] oh this will preach brother danny it's
[1:32:33] not up to me and you to see whether
[1:32:35] it'll be saved or not
[1:32:36] it's up to god
[1:32:41] heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:32:44] this word
[1:32:45] and if i'm in that word and the
[1:32:48] attributes of god is on the
[1:32:50] inside of me there's nothing
[1:32:59] hallelujah now i want to say this to you
[1:33:03] that's almost like cheatin yeah

[1:33:20] you really believe that
[1:33:23] and you can't fail
[1:33:30] is this microphone working

[1:33:56] that's got you
[1:33:57] [Applause]
[1:34:02] hallelujah god is worth no more than his
[1:34:06] word
[1:34:07] but and if his word is no good then he
[1:34:09] is no good
[1:34:12] and if i can't put confidence in what he
[1:34:15] said
[1:34:15] he said you're no good but you're as
[1:34:17] good as your word is
[1:34:19] and god is as good as his word is
[1:34:22] yes and i as a christian believer
[1:34:26] i believe that the bible is inspired i
[1:34:29] believe it is
[1:34:30] written by the holy spirit and it is
[1:34:33] infallible
[1:34:34] word of god and
[1:34:37] god is under obligation to his word
[1:34:41] and to the believer that will accept it
[1:34:43] and
[1:34:44] any word is his seed and if you accept
[1:34:47] it in your heart by faith
[1:34:49] and believe it and confess it
[1:34:55] god will bring it to
[1:34:58] pass
[1:35:01] you've heard me read this quote a
[1:35:04] thousand times
[1:35:05] but one more is going to help prayer
[1:35:08] changes things
[1:35:10] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:35:13] has ever been
[1:35:14] put in control of human beings there's
[1:35:17] no
[1:35:17] atomic bomb hydrogen bomb
[1:35:21] as powerful as prayer
[1:35:25] let me explain something to you prayer
[1:35:27] is
[1:35:28] when a believer is talking directly
[1:35:32] to god
[1:35:36] there's no high priest in between
[1:35:39] no no no favorite preacher in between
[1:35:42] that's going to elect whether you get it
[1:35:44] done or not
[1:35:45] you're talking to god and he is our
[1:35:48] faithful high priest
[1:35:50] he is the intercessor of our prayers
[1:35:53] there's not a prayer too big and there's
[1:35:56] not a prayer too small
[1:36:00] his eyes is on the sparrow and i know
[1:36:02] that he's watching over you
[1:36:05] [Applause]
[1:36:08] if you get in a spot to where that you
[1:36:11] feel like the heavens has turned brass
[1:36:14] that means ever come to that spot i'm
[1:36:16] coming to an end here this morning
[1:36:18] but how many has ever come to a spot to
[1:36:20] where it felt like your prayers
[1:36:22] was not going past the ceiling
[1:36:28] it's kind of like preaching sometimes
[1:36:29] and your sermon goes out and he goes
[1:36:36] but you're praying and it just seems
[1:36:39] like hey nobody's listening
[1:36:43] so what you do i'll tell you a secret
[1:36:45] what you do is go back and start
[1:36:47] thanking him
[1:36:52] for the things that he's done in the
[1:36:54] past
[1:36:56] and start rejoicing in what he did
[1:36:59] and have a have a situation to where
[1:37:02] that word david
[1:37:03] was talking to saul and he was on his
[1:37:05] way to take care of goliath
[1:37:07] and so he just started telling
[1:37:09] testimonies
[1:37:12] he was telling testimonies on his way to
[1:37:14] get to goliath
[1:37:16] brother branham would stand in the
[1:37:17] pulpit and he'd start telling
[1:37:18] testimonies

[1:40:48] last weekend brother ed hammermeister
[1:40:51] and their church
[1:40:53] hosted andrew and myself by video which
[1:40:55] we had played
[1:40:56] we had preached here a couple of weeks
[1:40:58] before that and we'd kept it offline so
[1:41:01] it'd be fresh to them
[1:41:02] but we wanted to make sure that all the
[1:41:04] technicals was worked out
[1:41:06] to where it could be fresh for them and
[1:41:08] and be right
[1:41:09] brother ed hammermeister's grandmother
[1:41:12] was escaping in the time of
[1:41:14] war in in the germany area
[1:41:18] and i don't have the exact town where
[1:41:20] they were at but they were escaping
[1:41:23] i think this might be world war one and
[1:41:25] they were escaping by foot
[1:41:27] on foot and she was alone
[1:41:31] and she had many children
[1:41:35] and in that escape she was making this
[1:41:37] journey and
[1:41:39] you know journeys sometimes have great
[1:41:41] harrowing details
[1:41:43] and here she is trying to provide for
[1:41:45] these children
[1:41:47] and she's trying to make a way to get
[1:41:49] away from the war
[1:41:51] kind of an exile and kind of moving out
[1:41:54] of this war region
[1:41:57] and they would travel for months
[1:42:00] literally months on their feet traveling
[1:42:03] to get away from the war
[1:42:05] one night she had all of her children in
[1:42:08] a barn
[1:42:09] they were all snuggled in the barn and
[1:42:11] she got them all asleep
[1:42:12] and god spoke to her during the night
[1:42:15] move your children
[1:42:17] and move them immediately and she began
[1:42:19] to move her children and i think it was
[1:42:21] i think it was many children that she
[1:42:23] moved and she moved him and when the
[1:42:25] last one was moved out
[1:42:27] a bomb hit that barn
[1:42:34] god made a way of escape
[1:42:48] as they were walking they were walking
[1:42:49] in the line and they came to a certain
[1:42:51] spot to where as they gathered with
[1:42:53] other people
[1:42:54] one of the little girls got separated
[1:42:58] she was separated four years
[1:43:02] four years
[1:43:05] one day god rich in his mercy
[1:43:09] that little girl came back into their
[1:43:11] life
[1:43:13] and it was just simple following and and
[1:43:15] got me home behind the wrong people
[1:43:18] and god made a way of escape for that
[1:43:20] little girl for four years
[1:43:22] let me just tell you god intake he knows
[1:43:24] how to take care of us
[1:43:26] he knows how to take care of us in a war

[1:56:38] bible malachi 3 and 10
[1:56:40] he said prove me and he is saying to you
[1:56:43] that if you're going willing to give

[1:56:54] hinges ain't squeaky he's ready to open
[1:56:57] up those windows and pour out a blessing
[1:56:59] upon you
[1:57:00] that you can't hardly stand that you'll
[1:57:03] be so embarrassed about well how'd you
[1:57:05] get this
[1:57:06] i got this by giving one tenth to god
[1:57:10] if you'd give one-tenth of your life to
[1:57:12] him this morning
[1:57:14] one-tenth of your money one-tenth of
[1:57:16] your energy one-tenth of your blessings
[1:57:18] one-tenth of your time
[1:57:20] oh he'll open up the windows of heaven
[1:57:22] so much on top of you and it's not
[1:57:24] lacking on his side it's lacking on your
[1:57:27] side this morning
[1:57:28] he's willing to give you deliverance
[1:57:30] he's willing to give you salvation
[1:57:32] he's willing to give you the baptism of
[1:57:34] the holy ghost he's willing to rock your
[1:57:37] soul in the bosom of abraham this
[1:57:39] morning

[1:57:42] to you this morning
[1:57:44] double folds coming your way
[1:57:49] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:57:55] it's amazing it's amazing when you
[1:57:59] you remember when we were as children
[1:58:01] and we would do a little bartering at
[1:58:03] school
[1:58:05] and mama looked at us and she'd say
[1:58:07] where'd you get that at
[1:58:10] well i traded this to get that and
[1:58:14] she said
[1:58:17] you know you know that thing that you
[1:58:19] traded wasn't that good i remember when
[1:58:21] i traded some erasers
[1:58:23] from them for them new mechanical
[1:58:24] pencils that they was making back when
[1:58:26] i was in school not when you was in
[1:58:29] school
[1:58:30] but i remember trading some halfway used
[1:58:32] up erasers and mom co-man
[1:58:34] she said how in the world did you get
[1:58:36] that
[1:58:37] it kind of embarrassed her that her son
[1:58:39] would do something like that but
[1:58:40] i want you to know what an amazing thing
[1:58:44] it is
[1:58:45] when you can look out and say
[1:58:48] everybody's looking at you how'd you get
[1:58:49] that
[1:58:51] you ain't got to be embarrassed about it
[1:58:53] god said that if you
[1:58:56] would let me prove myself to you
[1:58:59] you ain't got to be ashamed about what
[1:59:01] you got this morning
[1:59:03] oh maybe you got to beat up bento but
[1:59:05] you ain't going to be ashamed about what
[1:59:06] you got this morning
[1:59:08] maybe all you got is a double double
[1:59:10] wide this morning but you ain't got to
[1:59:11] be ashamed of that
[1:59:13] oh you can say god gave that to me
[1:59:15] because i gave my tenth
[1:59:17] i learned how important it was when i
[1:59:19] gave a quarter i learned how important
[1:59:21] it was when i gave a hundred i learned
[1:59:23] how important it was when i gave a
[1:59:25] thousand
[1:59:26] i learned how important it was and god
[1:59:28] was
[1:59:29] blessing when he gave a quarter and he
[1:59:31] was blessing when i gave a hundred
[1:59:33] and he was blessing when i gave a
[1:59:35] thousand what will he do when the
[1:59:37] children of god
[1:59:38] oh hallelujah gonna cut loose of
[1:59:41] everything
[1:59:42] i'm not talking about your money this
[1:59:43] morning i'm talking about when you go to
[1:59:46] cut and lose
[1:59:46] all the things that you're withholding
[1:59:49] from him
[1:59:51] when the woman took all that she had and
[1:59:55] spent everything she had to get that
[1:59:56] alabaster box
[1:59:58] she wasn't willing to take some of it
[2:00:00] back home with her she broke
[2:00:02] everything she broke everything to pour
[2:00:05] it upon the master
[2:00:08] she wasn't willing to take anything back
[2:00:10] to the house and neither was jesus
[2:00:11] willing to take anything back
[2:00:13] but he broke himself and he gave himself
[2:00:17] oh hallelujah church what a wonderful
[2:00:21] god that we serve this morning
[2:00:24] give the lord one more hand clap of
[2:00:25] praise for making a way
