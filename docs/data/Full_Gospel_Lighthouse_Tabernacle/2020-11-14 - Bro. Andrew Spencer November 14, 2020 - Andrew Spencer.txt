TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] listen did you know the bible predicts that in the last days that there'll be a germ warfare that diseases will break out upon the people and will fall on everyone without the baptism of the holy spirit but was the angel who had charged over these plagues was given orders to touch no one on whom the mark was how much kind of teachers have we got to be brother to get the church in order to be in that condition immune my arms are sore now from where the doctors just punched needles in to try to inoculate me from yellow fever and so forth i told them i didn't need it but they wouldn't listen to me but i'll tell you what god's going to do god's got a cereal and it's called the holy ghost and when that syrian goes in it'll inoculate you hallelujah in the last days i remember one time

way and he honored it all out from our little blood died first one day the bible says that things will break out on this earth and diseases our people be calculated and so forth but the bible says

to tell you i'm not speaking so and andrew will be speaking we we drove around the building and saw the cars and i said you can tell that andrew's speaking tonight so love you with all of our hearts i trust you've had a good week and we we love you so glad to have charlie with us sister nancy's cousin and i draw a blank exactly where she lives but that's that's okay gretna amen amen he's good to us sydney we have been on a journey for about a year and uh of course we've probably been on the journey a lot longer than that that the truth be no and unbeknownst to us but satan raised his head about this time last year and started to cause some situations to happen and it's brought us to a lot of different things we have been diagnosed with stage four cancer and i'm doing this more for people that are not here on the airwave than i am for you you know these things but we were diagnosed with stage four cancer within the first few months and and and of course it was it was in our lymph nodes and then in our lungs and uh there was just there was just big balls of cancer that was in our lungs and then then we would find out enough in a few weeks that we had brain cancer as well and so we we we have went and we've been diligent about every 12 weeks going to to the to the hos to the cancer center we have taken treatments two treatments a day all of this time and and and we have outlived all the projections that they said and we're just really thankful for that and we're just really thankful for that i want to share with you a scripture that says who hath believed our report and to whom this is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and a root out of dry ground and he hath no form nor calmlyness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions and he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed [Applause] [Music] we would like to just just share this week we it was november the 11th and it was armistice day and and uh and so we we know that it's recognized and brother brown said that the world war was stopped by the angels that stopped that stopped that killing this this this week we went as we do every 12 weeks we get a uh i'll just tell you we get an mri of the brain we get a scan of our lungs and a scan of all of our all of our parts to our pelvis and so uh they will give us an update of of where we are and so i'm going to give you this update this is the best reports that we've got yet and we're thankful for that we we we celebrate the moment so basically what the what the uh maybe some of you've seen some of the report but the x-ray technician as they are done and they give their report they they could not find any of those nodules that are in the lungs only could you see some strands that were there and so that's a phenomenal report an absolutely phenomenal report and so and so we're just we're just so thankful for that they they found something in my kidneys but the god that took care of it in the lungs can take care of it in the kidneys they don't know what's there um shouldn't knowing that i actually went for tests yesterday and uh should know in the coming days but a god that can heal it in the lungs can heal it in the kidneys or heal it wherever it's at um we still have two we still have two tumors that are cancerous tumors in the brain and so do i fear it no sir none whatsoever and you see we will continue the battle and i wanted to just take a moment here we celebrate where we are because it's a great big deal to be where we are and and andrew admonished me said dad go tell the people let's have victory go tell the people let's have victory sound the victory alarm amen we just we appreciate what god's [Applause] doing [Music] to god be all the glory you said well brother ron but you still have cancer well let me just say this to you maybe shamgar was fighting and he had 600 men to fight and it seemed unfair because satan didn't bring a thousand he's a dumb deliverable he only sent 600 against one man and he wasn't a warrior he just grabbed a stick and he went to work and somewhere around 200 or 300 he looked around and all those bodies was laying there i'm sure he began to feel good well this is kind of how where i feel at right now hallelujah and we believe a god that starts a work will finish a work and so we believe it with all of our hearts we will continue the treatments and uh however however long we have to do that we will do that for those that don't know we take immunotherapy by pill form and it is a it's a new qualified medicine that allowed me to be able to take that and respond i responded well to it and for those that don't think you ought to take medicine brother branham went to the best doctors in the world he went to the best doctors in the world went to mayo clinic and so and so he he didn't teach us nothing about not going to doctors and he said and if you go to the doctor he said you take the medicine and so and so i've been taking the medicine and and you know it makes me sick and you know we celebrate out here and there's times that we get sick and and it's it's some difficult days that we've had to deal with but we will press on the battle as long as it takes we're not quitting we're not giving up we're pressing forward in the name of the lord jesus christ so you know i'm sure david felt like having a dance when he saw goliath go down but the job wasn't done yet it was time he had to cut his head off so we will continue the work till we get his head cut off and so i certainly love you with all of my hearts and thank you for praying for me and we we we know that victory is ours and god's with us and and and the one that you know you're always happy when the doctors are happy and when when my doctor she just she just sit back on the counter the other day and she said you're a miracle she said every day you live is a miracle amen and so we're just uh we just are expressing we just want to continue to express that that every day is a miracle amen you say well brother ron i i went through some real difficult times i want you to just stop just a little bit tomorrow's not promised for any of us it's not promise for any of us but but if you take the right attitude if you take the right attitude god can help you in every battle that you're in that you're in i got a request just just today uh i got a note today of a sister that that's just panicked just literally panicked over over cancer just a little dot cancer if you're not careful it'll consume you it'll consume you by fear but if you don't fear it if you don't fear it even if it's in your brain if you don't fear it it don't control you and i don't want to be a slave to no devil i don't want to be a slave to no sickness and i don't want to be a slave to no sin amen we love you with all of our hearts and i'll some of you won't be here tomorrow and so i'll preach to you by the way of streaming but i wanted to share that with you because you prayed for it you prayed for me on wednesday and thank you for that it was a very rigorous day and and sister connie when we get over there and when we get over into heaven and and and she's got a great big house and i got a tent brother greg the reason she's that she gets the big house and i get the tents because she took care of me so well so so we just we just love you with all of our hearts amen god bless you andrew amen henry appreciates brother andrew [Music] i got a note here here a while back said when you're sitting there watching him preach said you look like you're so proud of him i said i am amen god bless you god bless you son i love you hallelujah god hath given us the victory oh god has given us the victory the victory the victory [Music] oh god hath given us the victory [Music] god given us the victory god has given us the victory the victory the victory oh god has given us a victory only god can do this aren't you thankful well gospel lighthouse you prayed for this and we have conquered a lot of the land but we still got work to do i don't believe that we prayed for our pastor just to get half the way better i believe we're praying for a complete and divine healing all over we will receive it and we will have victory amen god has given us the victory amen do you love our lord amen let's sing that song i sing that song more than anything as we get ready to turn our hearts to the word i'm a happy man if all we have to do is just point at testimonies tonight and point at our pastor we could say that god's still god because there's many a cancer patients that would love to hear those reports there's many people that would love to have those reports of over anything getting better when life seems to kind of fade on out but to see what god is able to do right here amongst us i remember when a pastor from jamaica come and stood behind this pulpit so most of you remember that and said he said god spoke to me and told me that there's no reason that full gospel lighthouse should miss the rapture there's no excuse this god has been right here right here right amongst us all this time what can he do for you what can he do for you let's just turn our hearts to him this evening more than anything amen more than anything oh i love you jesus oh more than anything oh more than oh more more than anything [Music] oh i love you jesus so much more more than anything [Music] [Music] oh more than anything oh i love you jesus oh more than anything oh more anything oh more than anything i love you my jesus oh more than [Music] anything father we love you more than houses more than land more than wealth and health father we love you and father we just want to echo out from our heart how grateful we are to be standing in these moments predestination father that we know that you had ordained before the foundation of the world father we think about all the prayers that this full gospel lighthouse has prayed throughout the years but this past year father and to see that we're standing in the moments of those prayers coming to pass father we say we say thank you we thank you for all that you have done for us we thank you for saving us we thank you for giving us our pastor father back from cancer we thank you lord jesus for the healing touch now lord we know that we've got much ground to cover and lord doctors see even tumors in in the brain that's there's nothing too hard for you lord even see either either blood clots or something else in the in the kidneys there's nothing too hard for you and lord there's cases that have been presented to you right here from this pulpit of prayer requests there's nothing too hard for you all it takes is one moment with el shaddai and father i believe that you're here tonight and you're visiting your people lord to to declare that there's there's no god like jehovah and i pray tonight that as you would begin to manifest yourself lord let your word ring out true into the ears of every human being that is sitting under the sound of our voice this evening lord we've not gathered here to be seen of man we've not gathered here to see one another we've gathered here to see you and hear from you and lord we we don't want to have a protractive meeting father lord we want to have a divine fellowship and a communion with you father we can say that jesus said across from the table and jesus began to speak to us and jesus discerned our hearts and jesus began to move into our address and know the secret things that only he would know about father we pray that you'd speak to us through your word today in jesus name amen amen if you have your bibles this evening we'll turn over in the book of deuteronomy chapter 27 and verse 9 and then also chapter revelations chapter 3 and verse 20. we certainly enjoyed having brother jason here last weekend and i believe that god ordained that and just supernatural events transpired and and some of you to ask you know he he stood from the pulpit and and asked and hoped that he would get a 12 point buck well he did get a buck and it was a half rack buck and it had two on one side and we're not really sure what the other side could have been so it could have been a 10 10 on that side we don't know but we do know that at least got the two points and so so we're thankful for for what lord has done and and so we just we'll just have to have him back to make sure he gets the other 2 10 points at some point so we just thank the lord for brother jason he means he means more to me than i could ever express to you he is he's one of my best friends in life and and just i i love him and his ministry and and he's just a real bosom buddy to us and certainly enjoyed that but we're looking forward to what god has in store for us this weekend and i'd like to speak to you by the help of the lord on on the voice on the voice of the lord deuteronomy chapter 27 and verse 9 and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou art become the people of the lord thy god thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day also revelations chapter 3 and verse 20. very familiar scripture to us here we see as jesus is speaking to the last church age of the closing of the book and and he says behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me now notice that that jesus is not speaking to an individual but he is speaking to a church and it is not an individual there where it's an open invitation or or that where where men would preach oftentimes that jesus here is knocking at the door of every every sinner trying to gain entrance but here jesus is speaking to the last church age and notice where jesus is jesus is on the outside of the church and he's supposed to be on the inside but jesus said that i behold i stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to set with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne and he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches may god bless his word you may be seated this evening amen uh in the philadelphian church age i believe the brothers have it for you this evening he said the last age will be a short one a quick work of consummation and not only is this so but one must always remember that in the eyes of god time is very so very fleeting yeah a thousand years or but a day and if he is coming within a few hours as he views time then he surely must warn us with all urgency and his voice must continually sound in our hearts to be ready against that coming oh there are so many voices in the world so many problems and needs crying for attention but there will never be a voice so important and so worth attending as the voice of the spirit so he that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches and he that have an ear let him hear what he what the spirit saith to the church how many has an ear here this morning this evening so we realize that that through this hour and through this message and we understand that that throughout the chaos of life that the voice of god is a very rare thing today and many times people try to embellish or many times people try to say that the lord said this to me and really when god didn't really say anything to them but it begins to get so common that that people say well god gave me this dream or god gave me this revelation but the voice of god is such a very rare thing but but whenever god speaks you realize that when god is speaking he always backs it up with an amen but the reason why that the voice of god is such a rare thing today is because it's been smothered out by so many different voices of voices of politics and so many things that are there to to dim and take away uh take away from the take away from the voice of god and we realize that we're living in an hour that we're living in an hour where everything has a voice where where every person has a voice and every person has a platform you think about even 20 to 30 years ago man didn't have the platform that he had that he has in this day but every person has a voice in this day every person has a platform where they can put forth their agenda where they can there they can voice their ideas and whether it be facebook whether it be instagram whether it be messaging or wherever it is snapchat they have a platform in where that they can where they can voice their opinion and and voice their agendas and voice their thought and and you look at the world today and everybody's got their same agenda everybody's moving in one direction but i believe that today that the voice of god is directing a people in a different direction that every other voice is pointing pointing them you look at hollywood it's got a voice and it's sending people on a path to hell and many times when men is living in this hour they're listening to the chaos of life and they miss when god is speaking to them you see there's many of people that want god i believe that every person sitting here or listening this would say that they want god to speak to them is that right we want god to speak to us but many times we we've been we've got so much going on we've got to get little joey over here to baseball with susie over here to soccer and we gotta pick up the groceries gotta worry about a mask oh i forgot my mask gotta go to go back to the car and get a mask there's so many things that are there to distract us from the voice of god and when he's trying his best to speak to people they miss when god is speaking to them and they miss what is really happening to them but the voice of god is not a dead voice this evening it's a very alive voice and it's still speaking to people and turning the hearts of people you look at yourselves this evening you look at what just happened this evening or what you've just heard about that is due to the voice of god speaking things into existence and people of god believing what god has spoken and watching those things be made manifest right in front of them i'm not interested in hearing about fox news i'm not interested in hearing about cnn i'm not interested in religion i'm not interested in what man's got to say i'm not interested in science i'm not interested in politics i'm interested in one thing and that's the voice of god it's it'll be that voice that'll change this corrupt body it'll be that voice that'll put me in a body change it'll be that voice that gives me overcoming power i don't want to hear others speak i want to hear god speak now notice this now he said if others voices are contrary to the voice of god then it must be the voice of our enemy to confuse us that we would not understand the voice of god when it spoke brings great clarification to it it's that simple there's so many voices in the earth today that is absolutely a hard thing because it didn't the voice of the supernatural there is so many intellectual voices and great voices of mighty man who are intellectual that in their intellectual conditions even shake nations they are not just overnight people but they shake nations bringing great organizations together great campaigns flowery and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them of of how that these things go on and prosper and there's voices that raise up and do these things and it causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere the true voice of god and the voice of god they say how will we how will we know it's the voice of god because for today then it was in a vindicated prophet but now today how we know it's the voice of god are you listening how we know it's the voice of god it's because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word and this is god's prophet and a true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god i know you've seen it on the screen but i want you to catch this and i want you to see how evident this is only a true voice a true voice of god only it doesn't bring up everything else in the world it doesn't bring up chaos and all these other things but the true voice of god only brings back that real living supernatural god with his supernatural word with the supernatural manifestation of the true church or the true word then we know it's the voice of god you see if it's a true voice if if someone says well i'm going to this is what god has spoke to me and it doesn't come to pass it's pretty simple you know that god didn't say that is that right you remember when that woman came to brother branham and said the lord has made me a prophetess he gave me a great ministry and he told him about the lost dutchman mine and he said well that's just a legend out there she said well he told me to be on such and such date and fail and these things and to have these things in place say what do you think about that brother branham he said all i can tell you is be there on such and such day and see if it comes to pass well it never came to pass you seen which voice was speaking to them there's many of people that hear voices in their head today but there's only one voice that'll lead you right back to the word there's only one voice that'll make this live and if it's a true voice of god this voice will act it'll move it'll vindicate it'll be proven accurate just like when lazarus had died there was a lot of people that loved lazarus there's a lot of people that was concerned about lazarus even the disciples were concerned that jesus wasn't even moved when they came and told him that our brother is sick there was a lot of people that was concerned about lazarus there was a lot of people that would have wished lazarus back from the grave but only one voice had their power and the authority to raise lazarus up out of that grave here there sure mary and martha yes they would have loved to raise them up they knew they'd been walking through walking with and watching the ministry with but only he had the power and he had the authority to get a man that had been dead for four days nose done sunk in right in there in the grave even the sister said lord if you open that up thing now he's going to be staking in there it's going to be a stench come out of that place but jesus had such authority in his voice this was not just a man that was speaking this was more than a man but i want you to catch when you look over in john chapter 11 he told them to roll away the stone he told them you roll away the stone now jesus had all of the power in heaven and earth he had enough power that he could have spoke that rock and that stone right out of existence but brother branham said that hit was showing that you've got something to do i can stand here and i can preach i can get anointed i can even speak in tongues but until you move that stone out of your life the stone of unbelief the stone of circumstance the stone of life it won't ever do one good thing until you do something you got something to do in this service and only you know what you can do i know what i got to do but only you know what you can do and if you will move that stone out of your life you'll watch resurrection power come to a dead man hallelujah you'll watch as the authority of the lord begins to raise up life again and when jesus the bible said that jesus cried with a loud voice a man that had been dead four days in there rotten in their stinking he got up out of that grave but he didn't raise up there in that same condition that he went in he rose up a new man and that same voice is what's called you to this hour to this ministry to this time in which you're living you're not the old corrupt man that you used to be you're a new man in christ jesus you put off the former conversation and the lust thereof hallelujah hallelujah now look in the message look he says now god could have chose to preach the gospel by the sun by the moon by the stars by the wind or by nature but he chose men men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of god will come from but he chose men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of god will come from and you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses then you can see what kind of a voice that you're listening to if it's contrary to the word of god don't listen to it but if it is the word then god is duty bound to back that word up and vindicate it and make it truth because he's promised to do it so we're living in a great day these words of christ expressed and god has promised to us that he would meet the need of the hour and he always does is that right and what we need in this hour is the voice of god you can shut me down but you can never stop this voice are you with me i hate to break it to you i know it even breaks sister katy hart sometime but you realize that my literal voice is not the voice of god i know some of you were attached to this beautiful voice of mine just so connected to it it breaks your heart but my literal voice is not the voice of god because there's people in china people in zimbabwe that have never heard this whole country voice that talks twangy talks in all kinds of different stuff and sometimes i don't even understand what that thing's saying but my literal voice is not the voice of god and neither is william miriam branham's voice his literal voice the voice of god it was a instrument of humanity in which god showed forth his seventh angel's messenger his message came through that body i know it hurts your feelings i know it shakes you down to your core but the voice is not the william branham is not the voice of god only the voice of god is the voice of god you see if all you hear is my voice if all you see is me you have missed everything brother branham was a man brother brandon made mistakes i'm a man i know it i i know it hurts your feelings but i'm a man there's sometimes there's no way there's no way that god would say some of the things that come out of your mouths is that right oh my goodness 90 of us just accepted that we're human well done you did a great job well done i was waiting for it and you just whoo deep revelations are poured out but you know good you know good things there's some things that come out of your mouth and you're thinking did i do that but you know good and well there is times in your life that you know only god could have said that out of you come on somebody you know what i'm saying to you there's only he could say those things we've watched from this pulpit when the spirit of the lord would come down and move on top of a situation you knew that it was no longer ron spencer andrew spencer william borlavano matt spencer you knew it was the voice of god brother branham would say now i'm just your brother i'm just your brother but when the angel of the lord moves down then it becomes the voice of god oh hallelujah then i hear a prophet say your voice is his voice there is deity speaking on the inside of a body and there is resurrection power that will lift this body right out of here one of these days it won't be my voice it'll be his voice coming out [Applause] that voice had so much power in it that lazarus was way into another realm and he began to converse and he began to talk with abraham and he said the ones that you've seen abraham that you've seen when he was coming down that dusty road he said i was just with him and all of a sudden he began to tell joseph and he began to tell daniel all about him and then all of a sudden there came a voice that said lazarus come forth what was it it was a voice from another world calling him back into that world i have heard a voice from another world that's told me that this world is not my home and i'm just a passing through it'll be that voice that takes me from this realm into that realm hallelujah hallelujah jesus said john john chapter 10 and 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me i know sometimes the voice can be a little tough on your five senses it can be tough on you five senses but i've never heard that voice ever heard hurt that sixth sense there's a lot of people that get offended by this voice but i choose to stick with this voice it may hurt my it may hurt my five senses of humanity but if the voice said that a woman's hair is her glory and it should not be cut i stick with the voice if the voice said in deuteronomy 22 and 5 that a woman should not wear anything that pertains to a man i'll stick with the voice if it says we shouldn't paint up like a bunch of jezebels i stick with a voice if it says men should be men and women should be women i stick with a voice my sheep know my voice and they follow me if you can follow this voice through all of the pain and the hurt of these five senses it shows what you are some people think why in the world are you following that i'm just a sheep being led by my shepherd but a stranger they will not follow you can watch a howling come up and watch him try to turn your attention off in a different direction and you watch that sheep that sheep is accustomed to that shepherd she knows she knows where he's leading her and it's only the green pastures oh hallelujah it may be a rough road to get you there but you follow that shepherd he'll put you right in the body change you follow that shepherd through all of the word not half of it but all the way through [Applause] hallelujah it's only the voice of god that gets our attention just like when elijah was laid up in a cave a whirlwind came by and it didn't grab his attention the earth began to shake and it didn't grab his attention the thunderings the roarings they didn't grab his attention but when he came behind the steel small voice that's where god's at you watched last weekend when you watched that holy huss fall on this place only god could do that i know the backside of those things only god could do that that was not brother jackson that was god you see and then as you were aware that the angel the lord the pillar of fire was visible in this service he was very visible in the service i heard i heard a prophet say he said now when he appears he's got something to say hallelujah you take a look back at those words you take a look back at that sermon last weekend and you'll see that god had something to say hallelujah do you do you believe that he's here now do you believe that he's visible now he's got something to say now notice god never speaks a word unless he's got a reason for speaking that word he's not like you and i that we or especially myself that just speaks things so so many foolish things god speaks every word with a meaning and something that he is trying to achieve and will achieve by his word you see when god was going to use the earth and it was in complete and total darkness the spirit of god spoke out and said let there be light hallelujah and it was light because the voice spoke it and it manifested and as long as it went out of its mouth out of his mouth in a word it has to be manifested and you watch what happened when that when that word was spoken let there be light darkness begin to scatter that's what light does it's still doing the same exact thing today that light of the word is coming across your path and it's driving away the darkness of laodicea driving away and what is it it's his voice notice in psalms 29 and 3 the voice of the lord is upon the waters the god of glory thundereth the lord is upon many waters the voice of the lord is powerful the voice of the lord is full of majesty the voice of the lord breakthroughs yea the lord breaketh the cedars of lebanon he maketh also to skip like a calf in lebanon assyrian and like a young unicorn the voice of the lord divided the flames of fire the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of cadets the voice of the lord maketh the hinds the calf and discover his force and in the temple duff he does everyone speak of his glory you notice when jesus was walking with his disciples when they came a corner upon a tree that did not bear fruit that jesus began to curse that tree and that tree immediately withered at the voice of the lord jesus it showed that he was interested in all things he was interested in a small thing when this thing would not produce life in the presence of almighty life he cursed it and you look at somebody's life let me just preach this for a moment when you look at somebody's life and you see that they're standing right there you know when you're standing right in the presence of jehovah and they don't produce life you're looking upon something that has been cursed hallelujah but you can hear that same voice as they begin to restore life to lepers that were completely cleansed you watched that same voice as prostitutes were made clean you watch that same voice take dead life and bring it right back to life you watched that voice as he began to take bread in his hand and they began to bless that bread it became cooked bread and it fed 5 000. that voice has the power what's your situation what's your torment one moment with this voice with the god of this voice it'll change it'll change cancer it'll change tb it'll train sugar diabetes it'll change heart trouble it'll change kidney disease one moment in his presence oh just let him speak he spoke a world into existence surely he can change every every eye every cell in your body to make it obey his word i notice he says he said now now this microphone here it's a mute unless there's a voice here to go through it that's the way we are the church is the church is a complete mute unless it's subject to the spirit of god to let the spirit speak through the church as god will and then it becomes a voice to the world as long as it's an outlet the church is an outlet of the voice of the lord jesus to the peoples of the world you have that much power that the church is an outlet of the voice of the lord jesus to the peoples of the world noah was an outlet he was an outlet when nobody else would stand with him when there wasn't a cloud in the sky when there was when there was scientific proof that there was no rain up there no noah was an outlet to the dying generation that there was a guard that said it's going to rain he said that voice spoke to me it said noah it's going to rain and he told me that voice said go out and build a an ark and you're going to build this thing to such and such cubits and you're going to make it this big and you're going to make it out of impossible wood impossible but then i want you to pitch it with tar i want you to build it in such the dimensions and everything else it didn't make sense to nobody else but noah said i'm following a voice he was an outlet to a world that did not believe him and there was critics sitting there and said there's no way possible noah you're dreaming up some kind of crazy thing we've got we've got the technology to shoot rays or lasers up there and see there's nothing up there but in the face of the critics he stood there and said a voice spoke to me to do this and i'm going to do it i heard a voice that preaches sermon and you may be against me but i'm gonna preach this term i heard a voice that told me to get ready for a body change you may not want to sing with me but i'm going to sing to the way till the praises come down i heard a voice that built it this way and i'm going to build a church this way according to the gospel every critic in hell might be against me brother nathanael but as for me and my house i'll follow this voice when nobody else wants to walk with me when everybody else wants to go away i will follow this voice to the ends of the world he's made some supernatural promises and i am just supernatural enough to believe them you say it's going to take a whole lot of faith to believe what this bible says that's exactly what it's going to take hallelujah god sees behind closed doors he knows all things he sees all things he's saying he knows what you say behind your door i believe that there's a god god of elijah still here that knows the secrets in that ahab's tent i believe there's a god still here that can read and discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart and when you try to muzzle the ox that tread is left what are you doing you're stopping the voice of god and when you're talking about the ministry behind closed doors and you think that you're getting by with it because you're talking about somebody in the flesh you are muzzling the ox and your children will never follow this voice because of a perverted parent it's not the children's fault it's a delinquent parent [Applause] this is more in santa claus he sees you when you sleep and he sees when you're awake perry green perry green and brother billy paul went to school together and and dean saunders called called billy paul into the office and give him a riemann over over certain things and aaron and billy paul just stood there and took it and he walked out i mean he dean saunders really gave it to him is what perry green said really gave it to him billy paul just walked out and then all of a sudden dean saunders got a phone call he come out and he said perry he said did billy paul use that telephone when he come out of this room he said no sir he said why he said i just got the strangest call he said his daddy all the way up in jeffersonville just called me and told me everything that i said to his son what was it it was the god of elijah that could see he sees what you've said he knows what you're doing in your prayer life some people want god to speak to them but they picked up a bible in 10 years and they want god to speak to him if you'd open up your bible and you'd read genesis 1 you could say that god spoke to you but if all you read is a newspaper you're never going to hear anything about the voice of god in there let me move on for y'all lynch me here oh hallelujah i can't say that word today let me move on before y'all just dragged me out i can't probably even say that i'm sure i offended somebody by now bless god we're in 2020. everybody's offended at everything well bless god the preacher preached on me what do you think he's going to do bless god hallelujah moses was an outlet moses heard the voice of god and he was full of theology he knowed all the ins and outs but failed he heard the voice of god and moses was never the same and no man is never the same you might hear in your ears a voice speaking but when you hear it in your heart the voice speaking then you're hearing you do not see with your eye you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something you see something and say well i just don't see it you mean you don't understand it you don't hear with your ears you're here with your heart and many times your ears hear the true voice of god and it falls off of you like water off of a duck's back but when you're really here you hear with your heart let me give you a little illustration something to make you laugh but understand what i'm saying us boys we were hunting this week and we were where gabriel was in front of me and he was driving we done been hunting we're driving back in the dark and going back home and we're coming back so gabriel gabe there's his nut walking on the side of the road it looked like he's in pitch black walking down side of road just right on the edge of the road i always love it it's like they're wanting to get hit bless god and this guy this guy's walking on side road and gabriel's in front of me and there's a little distance between me and him he's a state trooper he knows we can get by with and what things so anyways he's uh he's in front of me and he reaches down in his pocket and grabs his phone out and he he calls he goes andrew he calls he calls andrew and says hey watch out there's a guy coming upon you but he calls the wrong andrew it caused the wrong answers this guy says what what what are you talking about he said who is this he says andrew he said who's this is that escape he said huh he's like i'm sorry he said i was meant to call my cousin i spent it called my cousin andrew and i accidentally called you he said man you don't have any words somebody's about to come up and get me he said watch out for somebody they're coming up on you he said here i am sitting in my couch somebody's about to get me then he picked up the phone and he called me and you see when he called me i knew exactly what he was talking about because what the voice was saying was very relevant to me because i was following him but that other god didn't have a clue what he was talking about because the voice that was speaking to him he didn't know where it came from are you with me you see it's as soon as it came to my ears i knew what he was speaking because it was relevant to the path that i was on and when i hear this voice as it's calling out my name i know what it's taking me to because i'm on the same path there's a lot of people that it just goes off their back because they're not trained to the true voice of god because it's not relevant to them but when you hear it you know hey he's calling my name when he says hey there's somebody coming upon you jesus said hey watch out satan's got a trap you know what he's talking about because it's relevant to you hallelujah hallelujah the bible said in hebrews 11 and 28 that by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible moses left egypt on two different occasions and on each occasion everyone each one were completely and distinctly different and completely different circumstances on the first time that he had moses left egypt he left israel behind in egypt and he went out in fear but when he come back the next time and he left he tripped he left with israel and he left with faith and the ultimate difference in the second time compared to the first time was because a voice had told him moses you're going down there to take over everybody else thought he was crazy but he was a channel to the world moses said he talked to a bush hat dudes nuts there's no way we're going to believe him last time i seen him he was a murderer now he's talking about a bush that was on fire and it wasn't consumed but it was a channel to the rest of the world but there were people that realized that what moses was saying was the voice of god that god had finally sent his deliverer to them and god had sent him down there to egypt to take over now notice when the prophet got down there he showed them phenomena because he was god's voice how could a man pick up dust and throw and say thus save the lord not a flea in the country and then a couple hours from then everything is crowded full of fleas not a fly nowhere at all and he said let there be flies and the first thing you know a big old blowfly began to fly around and they were bloating the people everywhere what man could do that let me ask you this what man could do this what man could speak life in the lungs that cancer was trying to stop cancer was going for a death blow what man could produce these results but god this was not a man's voice that we trusted we trusted almighty god it was god using that prophet making his word assigned to give a call we're going out of egypt but he didn't just send his voice to take them out of egypt he sent his voice his voice was sent to come out and to go into they were getting ready to make an exodus and the first exodus what did he do he brought them from a natural land to a natural hand in the second exodus he brought them out from a spiritual condition into a spiritual baptism of the holy ghost but now in this third exodus he is bringing us from a spiritual baptism of the holy ghost right back in eternal land of the millennium and the great hereafter we're not going to a land we're going to a home it's this voice that'll put us there he was so much god's voice he was so much a channel that when he stood there in front of the red sea and he said stand still and see the vow salvation of the lord and when jehovah spoke now this sea had seen a lot of things this scene had seen a lot of fish is a lot of big fishes seen a lot of people cast their net out there in that sea but they had never seen anything like this if we could have a news conference with the sea this evening and say hey see now tell me can you describe to me what you have seen here oh i don't know how i see would talk but well our theme was but the scene began to take it would begin to talk to us and he would say i seen something i've never seen you see i was made before the found i was made i was made in the world and god spoke water into existence and here i am and i've stood here every day of my existing life and i've stood here and i've watched as the water would go down and it would come back and the waves would crash on and say but this thing i saw so something so extraordinary something happened on the inside of me something began to push me up and created walls and the ground in which i had spent most of my time going over in the rocks which would be muddy it'd be clean it completely became dry and i watched people that were pretesting before the foundation of the world walk over on the ground that i had covered i'd rather hear that report than anything fox news has got to say well you say you're listening to a sea at least the c's got to testify about god hallelujah what was it it was god speaking if you would allow that voice to operate this evening it would operate in this world and it would speak things right out of existence in your life there's so much authority and so much power in the voice of jesus you as a church you know all of the ins and outs of the miracles and the power of almighty god this voice can turn situations you remember when in in the bible when when jesus said i'm close now that is resurrection power right there and watch people roll him shoulders back get ready grab your purse put your coat on get your keys he's closing sometimes i ought to say that at the very beginning see really what happens man that would mess up your minds if i said hallelujah i enjoy my jesus i don't know about you but i enjoy mine but when jesus after he had went out about his work in the day he he got in a boat and his disciples got in the boat with him but you know i love i love his story when jesus gets in the boat and there it comes a great storm out upon the sea jesus gets in the boat and what does jesus do jesus goes to sleep but what i love about this story is that jesus when when all the chaos of life was going on jesus didn't have to have a cup of folgers to wake him up and make him realize that he was jesus he woke up knowing that he was jesus and he got up and he said oh you faithless generation why are ye of little faith he didn't stumble over his words he didn't guess well i gotta have my second cup of coffee but when jesus got up when jesus got up he was jesus when jesus was sleeping he was jesus but when jesus got up he was jesus and jesus spoke peace to that storm and the disciples were in the same boat and the bible said that they marveled what matter of man is this that the winds and the sea obey him i pray to god that you would even marvel yourself when jesus gets woke up in your life oh hallelujah you ain't gotta have 15 cups of coffee and a red bull to wake up jesus just wake up that spiritual life on the inside of you and watch jesus go to work let's stand hallelujah i know that y'all be happy to hear this a lot of y'all a lot of my people y'all love some coffee but you know i heard that there's gonna be coffee in heaven that's what i heard because you can look over in the new testament it says that hebrews hallelujah hallelujah well i'm happy every day as i journey through this land well i've been mighty blessed of god i'm holding to his head well the journey's almost over the battle's nearly won and i got a feeling down in my heart the best is yet to come oh the best is yet to come when i walk through heaven's gates when i see my jesus i can hardly wait he's gonna show me to my master say this is your new home and i got a feeling down in my heart the best is yet to come help me out another key oh the best is yet to come when i walk through heaven's gate when i see my jesus i can hardly wait he'll show me to my master say this is your new home and i got a feeling down in my heart the best is yet to come well i'm standing now on georgia time i see the raging sea [Music] take a loved one home to stay and i got a feeling down in my heart the best is yet to come oh the best is yet to come when i walk through heaven's gates when i see my jesus i can hardly wait he'll show me to my master say this is your new home and i got a feeling down in my heart the best is yet to come hallelujah i'm enjoying jesus on this side and i'm going to enjoy him a whole lot more when i get over there you love the lord have you heard a voice from another world say this is not your home you're only passing through there's some people that don't have a clue what's going on here it's not relevant to them but it's relevant to you and i we understand where we're going and where this voice is taking us from taking us to just uh just a note to you i know that a lot of people have been concerned about the governor's shutdowns and how things are going to move forward by the readings of the amendment we will be able to maintain our same path that we are on and just been on and continue our social distancing and wearing our mask in and out as we've been doing and and so until until something changes you just continue to plan to be here next saturday next sunday we'll continue the path and as we know we'll let you know so praise god i'll be glad when all this is over with i get sick and tired of reading the news and hear about more cases and seeing about this and this what's going on in politics and they're doing this to us and i'll be glad when i can leave this world and i ain't got to worry about a mask i think i'll worry about a mandate the only mandate i'm worried about is his mandate from heaven do you love the lord tonight aren't you thankful for what god has done for brother on aren't you thankful hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now i know this is this is for full gospel lighthouse what i say right here there's a lot of people that are listening and being a part of these services but this is for full gospel lighthouse you watched your pastor go through some stuff and i watched you as an associate pastor here i watched you your faith didn't waver no matter how sick he got your emotions were your emotions were up and down you were affected emotionally but you didn't waver in your faith you stood fast to his word because there was a voice that told us don't worry if you'll trust me i'll use you like never before and if you could just get behind the scenes for a moment i'd say that the ministry of brother ron spencer is being used more right now than it ever has before and i want to say this to the rest of the world i believe i love everybody out there before gospel lighthouse you have a very personal attachment to us i believe it was your prayers as long along with the bride of jesus christ but i believe was your prayers when your heart's in something you'll put everything into it when your heart's in something you'll pray more earnestly and more diligently i believe it's your prayers to an almighty god is the reason our pastor's still here we're not finished yet we've got much ground to cover we completely want supreme deity to come in and take over the whole entire body and drive cancer out and let this be a real testimony to the rest of the world ron spencer overcoming stage four cancer let that be lord for gospel lighthouse thank you every prayer we thank but thank you for gospel lighthouse i know it was tough on you to go through some things and we got tough days ahead maybe we got we got layouts here to go through but thank you thank you for not wavering thank you for standing as real sons and daughters of god and not not wavering but standing there in faith as real believers because believers believe that's what we do god bless you tonight as you're dismissed come to me lord with the fire of your spirit concern me lord and make me more like you if you have to
