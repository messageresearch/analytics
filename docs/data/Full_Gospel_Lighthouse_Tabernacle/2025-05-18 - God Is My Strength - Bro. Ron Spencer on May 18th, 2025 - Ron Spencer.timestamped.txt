[24:43] Lord, and that we can come into the
[24:44] house of God one more time. Lord, may we
[24:47] never take services like this for
[24:49] granted, Lord, in moments in your
[24:51] presence. Lord, we thank you for the
[24:53] blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us
[24:55] from all sin. Lord, we just want to
[24:57] humble ourselves before you this
[24:58] morning, Lord, and ask if there's
[25:00] anything in our lives, Lord, that just
[25:01] doesn't please you, that you come and
[25:03] just take it away, Lord, by the
[25:04] preaching of the word and by your
[25:06] spirit, Lord. Lord, we want to tell you
[25:08] that we love the word, Lord. Lord,
[25:10] sometimes correction can be
[25:11] uncomfortable, but Lord, we want it all.
[25:13] We want every aspect of the word,
[25:16] Father. We just ask Lord that as a word
[25:18] goes forth Lord may we just examine
[25:20] ourselves and see where we fall short
[25:21] and just to be honest enough with
[25:24] ourselves to say Lord I need your help
[25:26] right
[25:26] there. I need to draw closer to you
[25:29] Lord. I need to start doing more of
[25:31] this. I need to stop doing this. Give us
[25:35] the grace Lord to just humble ourselves
[25:37] Lord to the authority of your word.
[25:39] Lord, we lift up every request to you
[25:41] even now, Lord. And you know each and
[25:42] every need, Lord, and every life, Lord,
[25:44] that's beneath that hand. Lord, you're
[25:46] not too busy, Lord, to just take time
[25:49] with each and every life, oh Lord God,
[25:50] and each and every care and concern that
[25:53] we have, Lord. Lord, your your uh Peter
[25:56] said in the scripture, Lord, he said
[25:58] that cast all your burdens on you for

[26:04] you with all of our hearts, Lord. We
[26:05] just want to make special mention, Lord,
[26:07] of Brother Bill, Lord, and Sister
[26:09] Teresa, Lord, that you please be with
[26:10] them, Lord, and strengthen their faith,
[26:12] Lord, and help them, Lord, as they go to
[26:15] their respective appointments, Lord.

[26:32] intricate detail. And Lord, one day all
[26:35] things will be made right and all this
[26:36] will be over. But Lord, until then, we

[26:40] servant one more time. Bless them and
[26:43] help them. We pray, Father. We'll give
[26:44] you all the praise, honor, and glory.
[26:47] Bless your people and bless those that
[26:48] will be here in the service on the
[26:49] internet. Go by the airwaves, Lord, and
[26:52] just meet each and every need there as
[26:53] well. No doubt hands went up, Lord, and
[26:55] living rooms and different places where
[26:57] people can't come and they're streaming
[26:58] in. We pray you have your way now with
[27:00] this service. In Jesus Christ's name we
[27:02] pray and ask all these things.

[27:13] Marcus come prepare to come sing for us
[27:16] this morning. Maybe as we're receiving
[27:18] this morning's offering, we'll sing a
[27:19] song. You ask me why I'm happy. So, I'll
[27:22] just tell you why my sins are gone.
[27:24] Aren't you glad of that? Then after
[27:27] brother Marcus, we have Sister Melissa.
[27:29] Will you ask me why I'm happy? Oh, I'll
[27:33] just tell you why.
[27:37] Because my sins are
[27:40] gone. And when I meet the scoffers who
[27:45] ask me where they are, well, I
[27:49] say my sins are
[27:53] gone. They're underneath the blood of
[27:57] the cross of Calvary.
[28:00] as far removed as darkness is from
[28:05] God in the sea of God's
[28:09] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[28:12] me. Praise
[28:14] God. My sins are
[28:18] gone. It was at the old time altar where
[28:23] God came in my heart and
[28:27] now my sins are
[28:31] gone. Well, the Lord took full
[28:34] possession. Well, the devil did depart.
[28:38] I'm
[28:40] glad my sins are gone. Where they at?
[28:45] Well, they're underneath the blood of
[28:48] the cross of
[28:51] Calvary. As far removed as darkness is
[28:55] from
[28:57] God in the sea of God's
[29:00] forgetfulness. That's good enough for
[29:03] me. Praise
[29:06] God. My sins are gone.
[29:11] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[29:15] to make me down, will I
[29:19] say my sins are
[29:21] [Music]
[29:23] gone? Well, you got me into trouble, but
[29:28] Jesus got me out. Well, I'm
[29:32] glad my sins are gone. Sing it with me.
[29:37] Well, they're underneath the blood of
[29:40] the cross of
[29:42] Calvary. And as far removed as darkness,
[29:46] it's from
[29:49] God. In the sea of God's
[29:52] forgetfulness, it's good enough for me.
[29:56] Praise
[29:58] God. My sins are
[30:01] [Music]
[30:03] gone. Amen. And aren't you glad that you
[30:05] can say that this morning? All my sins
[30:07] are gone. Amen. You can be seated,
[30:22] Marcus. Sorry, I'm stumbling. I had a
[30:24] mishap last night. I was trying to act
[30:27] young.
[30:31] [Music]
[30:42] Empty and
[30:44] broken, I came back to
[30:48] him, a
[30:50] vessel
[30:52] unworthy, so
[30:54] scarred with sin.
[30:57] But he did
[30:59] not despair. He started
[31:03] over
[31:05] again. Oh, and I bless the day he didn't
[31:11] throw the clay
[31:15] away. Oh,
[31:18] over and
[31:21] over. He molds me and he makes
[31:26] me
[31:27] into his
[31:30] likeness. He
[31:32] fashions the
[31:34] clay. All a
[31:37] vessel of
[31:39] honor I am today.
[31:45] All because
[31:48] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[31:52] [Music]
[31:55] away. Oh, he is the
[31:59] potter and I am the
[32:04] clay
[32:06] molded in his image.
[32:09] He wants me to stay. But when I
[32:15] stumble and I
[32:18] fall and my
[32:20] vessel
[32:22] breaks, he does just picks up all the
[32:26] pieces. He doesn't throw the clay
[32:32] away
[32:34] over and
[32:36] over. He molds me and he makes
[32:41] me
[32:43] into his
[32:50] image. Oh, a
[32:53] vessel of
[32:55] honor I
[32:58] am today.
[33:01] All because
[33:04] Jesus, he didn't throw the clay
[33:10] away. He
[33:12] is the
[33:14] potter. Oh, and I am the
[33:19] clay
[33:21] molded in God's
[33:23] image where he wants
[33:26] me to
[33:28] stay. When my vessel, when I stumble and
[33:34] fall, my vessel it
[33:38] breaks. He just picks up those
[33:42] pieces. He didn't
[33:44] throw the clay
[33:48] away all
[33:50] over and over.
[33:54] He molds me and he makes
[33:57] me all
[34:00] into his
[34:02] likeness. He
[34:04] fashions the
[34:06] clay all the
[34:09] vessel of
[34:12] honor I
[34:15] am today.
[34:17] [Music]
[34:19] All because
[34:22] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[34:26] [Music]
[34:29] away. And when I'm tossed on life's sea
[34:34] and the waves covered me, well, in the
[34:38] dark clouds, they won't let the sun
[34:41] shine
[34:43] through. more than a voice it seems to
[34:47] sing. Child, there be a brighter day.
[34:52] Don't allow the storm to hide sweet
[34:55] heaven's
[34:57] view. Well, you've got one more trial
[35:02] and one more
[35:04] tear. Oh, maybe one more trial and one
[35:10] more tear.
[35:13] Oh, one more curve in life's road. Maybe
[35:18] one more mile to go. And you can lay
[35:22] down your heavy load when you get
[35:27] home. Well, don't let Satan see your
[35:31] tears. Learn to smile through your
[35:35] fears. Hold your head up high and just
[35:38] give the world a smile.
[35:42] Oh, you must be faithful all the way.
[35:47] It's going to be worth it all someday.
[35:51] For it's all going to be over after a
[35:56] while. Well, and you've got
[35:59] one more trial and one more
[36:03] fear. Oh, maybe one more trial for one
[36:09] more tear.
[36:12] Oh, and one more curve in life's road.
[36:17] Just maybe one more mile to go. And you
[36:20] can lay down your heavy load. And you
[36:24] can lay down your heavy load. You can
[36:28] lay down your heavy load when you get
[36:32] home.
[36:38] [Applause]
[36:43] Don't chase basketballs after your kids.
[36:48] God bless you.

[38:48] captive. Before

[38:59] light, there had to be
[39:04] darkness. Before there was ever an empty
[39:07] tomb, there was a
[39:13] quote, but you're right in the middle of

[40:02] you. You're still in his

[40:10] future cuz he has a
[40:14] plan. I promise he's got
[40:18] you. You're still in his
[40:22] hand. You don't see it, but you're right
[40:27] in the middle of a
[40:30] mir. You can't feel it, but under your
[40:35] feet, your roots are taken hold. Don't
[40:40] forget that with God all things are
[40:46] possible. Doesn't matter if it's broken
[40:49] or just dashes their soul.

[48:25] opened his mouth and taught them saying,
[48:28] "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
[48:31] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed
[48:34] are they that mourn, for they shall be
[48:36] comforted. Blessed are the meek, for
[48:39] they shall inherit the earth.
[48:41] Blessed are they which do hunger and
[48:43] thirst after righteousness, for they
[48:46] shall be filled. Blessed are the
[48:49] merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[48:52] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[48:54] shall see God. Blessed are the
[48:57] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[49:00] the children of God. Blessed are they
[49:02] which are persecuted for righteousness
[49:04] sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
[49:07] heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall
[49:10] revile you and persecute you, and shall
[49:13] say all manner of evil against you
[49:16] falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be
[49:19] exceedingly glad, for great is your
[49:22] reward in heaven. For so persecuted they
[49:26] the prophets which were before you. You
[49:29] are the salt of the earth. But if the
[49:31] salt has lost its savor, wherewith shall
[49:34] it be salted? It is thenforth good for
[49:38] nothing, but to be cast out, and to be
[49:40] trodden under the foot of men. Ye are
[49:43] the light of the world, a city that is
[49:45] set on a hill, and cannot be hid.
[49:47] Neither do men light a candle, and put
[49:50] it under a bushel, but on a candlestick,
[49:53] and giveth light unto all that are in
[49:55] the house. Let your light so shine
[49:58] before men, that they may see your good
[50:00] works, and glorify your father, which is
[50:03] in heaven. I want to for all of us to
[50:06] read this
[50:07] together in verse 13 down to verse 16.
[50:12] Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the
[50:15] salt hath lost its savior, wherewith
[50:18] shall it be salted? It is thenforth good
[50:22] for nothing, but to be cast out to be
[50:25] trotten under the foot of men. You are
[50:28] the light of the world, a city that is
[50:31] set on a hill and cannot be hid. Neither
[50:34] do men light a candle and put it under a
[50:37] bushel, but on a candlestick, and it
[50:40] giveth light unto all that are in the
[50:43] house. You your light so shine before
[50:47] men that they may see your good works
[50:50] and glorify your father which is in
[50:52] heaven. How many has a need this
[50:54] morning? You just like to say, Lord,
[50:56] would you remember me today? Let's just
[50:59] pray. Father, we love you today and we
[51:02] thank you for your goodness and your
[51:04] mercy in our lives. We're thankful for
[51:06] what you have done, are doing, and going
[51:09] to do. Lord, you see each and every one
[51:12] of our hands. I think we could all put
[51:14] our hands up and say, "God, I need you."
[51:17] I ask you that whether it's fear your
[51:20] whether it's physical, spiritual,
[51:23] whatever the need is, Father, we all
[51:25] need more of you. And I ask you today
[51:28] that you would help us to commit more of
[51:30] our lives to you. And Lord, we all need
[51:33] more of the Holy Spirit in our lives.
[51:35] And I pray that you would come and fill
[51:37] our cup in such a great way. Come and
[51:40] touch our lives today. Anoint this
[51:42] speaker. Lord, I I need a touch in body
[51:45] and I need a touch from you. And Lord,
[51:48] touch our our lives today. In Jesus
[51:50] Christ's name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[51:53] You may be seated.
[51:55] Today I want to I want to pray for
[51:58] sister Wanda and if and she has a
[52:01] condition in her body that's that has
[52:04] that's touched her and and I want I want
[52:06] her whole family to come and and uh her
[52:10] whole family if you will
[52:12] come and and they have found a a couple
[52:15] of growths in her body and there's
[52:17] markers that said it could be cancer.
[52:19] She said, "I'm not accepting it." Amen.
[52:22] And uh we don't accept the enemy's
[52:24] answer. And so, Amen. Amen. And so,
[52:29] we're just
[52:30] thankful. I was sharing with your
[52:32] husband that the other day when we ate
[52:35] dinner together,
[52:37] uh that I I felt this on you and I
[52:41] shared it with Sister Connie and then I
[52:43] made a note of it. I thought at first it
[52:46] was Randy. And that's what I thought
[52:48] because he's fought it. But I kept I
[52:50] kept praying about it and here we are.
[52:53] So God knew has known about it for quite
[52:55] a while and he knows about every trial
[52:58] that we go through. And I just want to
[53:01] say this to each and every one of you as
[53:03] family like Sister Connie and my
[53:05] children. Now you have a responsibility
[53:08] now to be cheerleaders.
[53:11] Amen. Your cheerleaders. If you've never
[53:14] prayed like you're getting ready to go
[53:16] into prayer, it's your turn. And so, you
[53:19] know, we pray about other people that
[53:21] has cancer and it doesn't seem to affect
[53:23] us until it hits our family. And so,
[53:28] God's greater than cancer.
[53:30] He's greater than cancer. And so, we
[53:33] believe and we we're praying no cancer.
[53:36] That's what we're praying is no cancer.
[53:39] But they're going to take these growths
[53:41] out. One is the size. I hear that one's
[53:43] the size of a grapefruit or a cantaloupe
[53:46] and amen. I remember when Sister Connie
[53:49] had a football and uh it was no cancer.
[53:52] And so we're just believing. We're
[53:55] believing with all of our hearts. And
[53:57] the scripture tells us, "Lay hands on
[53:59] the sick and they shall recover." And
[54:02] that's what we do today. We're
[54:04] exercising our faith in the word of God.
[54:07] And we believe it. Amen.
[54:11] She's going to be all right. Amen. Amen.
[54:16] Father, it's in the name of Jesus
[54:20] Christ, we ask you now that you would
[54:23] come and touch Sister
[54:26] Wanda. Lord, we have prayed privately
[54:29] for these things, but today we pray as
[54:31] an
[54:32] audience that you would come and touch
[54:34] her right now.
[54:37] Now I thank you for doctors and teams of
[54:39] doctors and nurses. I thank you for the
[54:42] medicine that you give now and have
[54:45] allowed to to help us. You do that to
[54:48] help
[54:49] humanity. But Lord, we lay hands on the
[54:52] sick and the scripture says when we lay
[54:54] hands on the sick, there's a light that
[54:57] it's
[54:59] transferred. And I pray that you would
[55:01] touch Sister Wanda
[55:03] today in the name of Jesus Christ. I
[55:07] pray to heal her body in the name of
[55:10] Jesus Christ. This is a report that we
[55:12] believe and we pray that you'd help this
[55:16] family.

[1:00:55] name of Jesus Christ, do we gather our
[1:00:59] prayers? Father, one to put a flight of
[1:01:02] thousand, two 10,000. Dear God, a three
[1:01:06] skull, threefold score uh cord is
[1:01:09] greater than an individual, just one.
[1:01:12] Now we bind together and believe your
[1:01:16] word. Satan, take your leave now.
[1:01:20] Father, doctors can do what they do and
[1:01:22] we thank you for them and nurses and the
[1:01:25] medicine. But I ask you in the name of
[1:01:27] Jesus Christ that you do a work this
[1:01:30] morning. And Lord, we stand. and she has
[1:01:33] neuropoly problems and I pray that you
[1:01:36] would touch her this morning in the name
[1:01:39] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Brother Bill has
[1:01:42] come today and Lord God you brought her
[1:01:46] him through a severe situation with his
[1:01:49] heart Lord as they go to put it back
[1:01:53] into order. We ask you that you would
[1:01:56] just go and be with him dear God. Lord,
[1:01:59] we pray that you would touch him,
[1:02:01] Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:02:04] pray. Amen. Amen and amen and amen.
[1:02:07] Amen. And amen. Amen. We're on the same
[1:02:12] team. Amen.
[1:02:17] Amen. I didn't see her. All right. Amen.
[1:02:22] Amen. Amen. You guys stand here. We'll
[1:02:25] pray. We got more to do. Sister
[1:02:29] Seilla
[1:02:30] King, I I didn't see you. You were
[1:02:34] sitting behind
[1:02:36] Mary. Amen. She had appendix
[1:02:40] surgery. Emergency surgery. Amen. You
[1:02:44] girls don't take off here. We got we got
[1:02:46] work to
[1:02:48] do. Amen. Amen. I love you.
[1:02:54] Do you know what God just brought you
[1:02:56] through?
[1:02:58] I want you to go home and I want you to
[1:03:02] I want you to do something. I want you
[1:03:04] to look up how many of the most powerful
[1:03:07] people in the world has died from what
[1:03:10] you just had. Come on.
[1:03:13] And God just brought you through it.
[1:03:16] And I want you to tell the devil, boo.
[1:03:21] And if the devil ever tells you he's not
[1:03:23] on your side, I want you to remember
[1:03:24] what you just went through this week.
[1:03:28] And we went to prayer when you when you
[1:03:30] begin to have problems. We went to
[1:03:32] prayer and I looked up the people that
[1:03:36] died from it this week. And that's why
[1:03:38] I'm telling you, and I said, "God,
[1:03:40] you're going to bring that little girl
[1:03:42] through this situation and it's going to
[1:03:45] be a phenomenal miracle." Amen. Amen.
[1:03:50] God bless you.
[1:03:53] Father, you have brought a miracle on
[1:03:56] Sister Seilla this
[1:03:59] week. And I want to thank you for
[1:04:03] it. And Lord, as she is recovering, I
[1:04:06] pray that you will touch her body and
[1:04:09] give her strength to be a wife and a
[1:04:13] mother.
[1:04:14] And Lord, as she looks back on these
[1:04:17] moments and you she reminds you, God,
[1:04:20] you have been with me, as I walk through
[1:04:24] the valley of the shadow of death. I
[1:04:27] pray that you will touch her body,
[1:04:30] minister to her, in the name of Jesus
[1:04:33] Christ, we pray. Amen and amen and amen.
[1:04:39] Amen. We sure love you. We sure love
[1:04:42] you. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen.
[1:04:46] Amen. This is some of the benefits of
[1:04:48] coming. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Give
[1:04:52] the Lord a great big hand.
[1:05:08] Amen. We as an audience just exercise
[1:05:11] faith. Amen.
[1:05:13] right in front of the devil's whipping
[1:05:16] post. And Amen. We just told him, "God's
[1:05:21] greater."
[1:05:23] Amen. Amen. I went to bed with that
[1:05:26] saying, "I'm going to wake up in the
[1:05:28] morning and and not be so drunk." And
[1:05:32] Amen. And I'm somewhat in that
[1:05:34] situation. So God's greater.
[1:05:38] Brother Brandham would say, "God calls
[1:05:40] the conference.
[1:05:43] You know, he calls a conference with
[1:05:45] with his
[1:05:46] people. And when he calls a conference,
[1:05:49] he don't just call a conference just to
[1:05:52] play a game. He's always got a something
[1:05:56] on his mind.
[1:05:59] And you may think that not much is going
[1:06:02] on in the
[1:06:04] world, but since since the last time
[1:06:08] that I spoke, we have an American pope.
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:14] And that that quote laid dormant for all
[1:06:18] of those years, about 60 years, that
[1:06:20] quote laid dormant. And and they, you
[1:06:23] know, I've heard all the skeptics say,
[1:06:24] "Well, that's never happened." and the
[1:06:26] transistors of popes, they have went and
[1:06:29] come and gone. And but we can now say
[1:06:32] that that prophecy
[1:06:35] is now fulfilled.
[1:06:38] And that pope just didn't come to be a
[1:06:40] pope just to for that quote to be
[1:06:43] fulfilled. But now he is calling for
[1:06:46] unity all over the world. And if you'll
[1:06:49] notice, he's calling for all the
[1:06:51] churches to come home.
[1:06:54] That's right.
[1:06:56] And that within itself is a powerful
[1:06:58] thing because we realize of her position
[1:07:01] on the earth.
[1:07:05] Our president, no matter what you
[1:07:07] thought of him or do think of him, just
[1:07:11] visited Abraham's children.
[1:07:14] That's right. You said you Abraham had
[1:07:17] more than Isaac.
[1:07:19] And when God as Melzdc was sitting and
[1:07:23] talking to Abraham, he said, "I'm going
[1:07:25] to bless your seed."
[1:07:29] And if you remember that was blessing
[1:07:31] was not just for Isaac, but was for all
[1:07:34] of his seed.
[1:07:36] And I marvel that the richest people on
[1:07:39] the earth is Abraham's seat.
[1:07:47] And so when our
[1:07:49] president goes to goes to Abraham's seed
[1:07:54] this
[1:07:55] week, he marvels at their great
[1:07:59] marble and their great palaces
[1:08:03] and now his plane.
[1:08:07] Come on.
[1:08:10] You
[1:08:11] know, he wants to do business with them.
[1:08:15] And you think, well, that's just
[1:08:17] something political. No, that's that's
[1:08:19] scriptural
[1:08:21] cuz now we're
[1:08:24] transitioning. We're transitioning into
[1:08:26] a
[1:08:29] tribulation prophecies.
[1:08:32] We're watching a pope and we're watching
[1:08:34] America play her part.
[1:08:37] But greater than all of that, if all of
[1:08:40] that is going on,
[1:08:44] if all of that is going on, and let me
[1:08:47] just stop. I missed one line. Russia is
[1:08:50] planning to launch a an international
[1:08:54] ballistic missile this
[1:08:56] week. Let me just say, none of that
[1:08:59] could go on except the bride be ready.
[1:09:07] Lord,
[1:09:08] are you with me? You see Abraham in this
[1:09:12] natural seed, whether they live up to a
[1:09:14] hundred years living in those palaces
[1:09:17] like they are, time will run out for
[1:09:20] them.
[1:09:22] The marbles will run out for them. And
[1:09:24] all of the servants, it'll all be over.
[1:09:28] But I'm preaching to the most powerful
[1:09:30] people on the earth.
[1:09:33] what they're living in won't make me a
[1:09:36] good dog house.
[1:09:38] [Applause]
[1:09:40] For where we're going.
[1:09:43] Hallelujah.
[1:09:45] Now, you may be a little bit
[1:09:46] uncomfortable down here in this world,
[1:09:49] but I want you to know you're going to a
[1:09:50] place
[1:09:52] whose builder and maker is God.
[1:10:00] But while you're
[1:10:02] here, you're the most powerful people on
[1:10:07] the earth.
[1:10:10] Amen.
[1:10:13] Moms, you're the most powerful people on
[1:10:16] the earth. That's right.
[1:10:19] Dads, you're the most powerful people on
[1:10:22] the earth. Amen. Amen.
[1:10:25] Young in college, young in high schools,
[1:10:31] middle schools,
[1:10:34] whatever school that you're in, you're
[1:10:36] the most powerful people on the earth.
[1:10:41] When you bow your knees to
[1:10:43] pray, you're not praying to a dead
[1:10:46] statue.
[1:10:49] You're not counting rosary beads, but
[1:10:52] you're talking to a God that hears every
[1:10:57] prayer
[1:11:00] with every word that you pray.
[1:11:08] The most supernatural thing about you is
[1:11:10] your tongue.
[1:11:13] The scripture says in Proverbs chapter
[1:11:16] 18 and verse 21, "Death and life are in
[1:11:21] the power of your
[1:11:24] tongue, and they that love it shall eat
[1:11:28] the fruit
[1:11:30] thereof." James 3
[1:11:33] 6. And the tongue is a
[1:11:37] fire, a world of
[1:11:40] iniquity. And so is the tongue among
[1:11:42] among our members, that it defileth the
[1:11:46] whole body, and setth on fire the course
[1:11:48] of nature. And it is set on the fire of
[1:11:51] hell. And every kind of beast, and of
[1:11:55] birds, and of serpents, and of things of
[1:11:58] the sea, is tamed.
[1:12:06] and hath been tamed of
[1:12:09] mankind. But the tongue
[1:12:14] can no man tame.
[1:12:18] It is an unruly and evil full of deadly
[1:12:24] poison.
[1:12:29] We've been Christians for decades now
[1:12:32] and still your tongue
[1:12:39] can cause you problems.
[1:12:43] You can live 24 hours a day, live with
[1:12:47] your beautiful
[1:12:48] queen, enjoy your perfect children.
[1:12:53] Amen.
[1:12:56] and in five minutes destroy the day.
[1:13:02] And you go, Satan, you used my tongue.
[1:13:08] Most of us here have so seven openings
[1:13:11] in your head. Amen. Two
[1:13:15] ears, two
[1:13:17] eyes, two
[1:13:19] nostrils, one tongue. Amen.
[1:13:23] Aren't you
[1:13:24] thankful that you just got one?
[1:13:32] Amen.
[1:13:34] Now, in Revelations 10 and verse 8,
[1:13:38] we're told to eat the book,
[1:13:41] and then we're told to prophesy again.
[1:13:44] We're told to speak it again. We're told
[1:13:47] to live the message. God just didn't
[1:13:50] send a message to us to where we could
[1:13:52] be brains with the mind of God. But now
[1:13:56] the message is to be lived.
[1:14:00] It's nice to put up pictures on a wall,
[1:14:03] hang eagles, whatever we do.
[1:14:08] Wear a bracelet or whatever you wear
[1:14:10] that that tells of the message of the
[1:14:13] hour. But this message is to be lived.
[1:14:19] It's to be lived.
[1:14:21] And and being the most powerful people
[1:14:24] in the earth, it's a lived word.
[1:14:28] And
[1:14:29] sometimes being a live
[1:14:32] word, say something.
[1:14:38] I would rather somebody live me a sermon
[1:14:45] than to try to preach me a sermon when
[1:14:48] it don't live.
[1:14:50] [Applause]
[1:14:52] I was reminded of being at a
[1:14:55] funeral only about uh maybe a couple
[1:14:58] years
[1:14:59] ago. the
[1:15:01] children, one of the children of that
[1:15:05] that young man walked up to me
[1:15:08] and and said, "I don't know if my daddy
[1:15:11] was a Christian." They went to service
[1:15:13] every time the doors were
[1:15:16] open. And he said, "I don't know if my
[1:15:18] daddy was a
[1:15:20] Christian." And I asked the question.
[1:15:22] And I said, "How do you don't know that
[1:15:26] y'all went to
[1:15:28] church every time the doors were
[1:15:32] open?" He's a teenage
[1:15:35] boy. He said, "I never saw my daddy
[1:15:41] pray." I'll be honest with you, I was
[1:15:44] taken back. I didn't know what to say.
[1:15:47] And then he made a statement. He said,
[1:15:48] "I never saw my
[1:15:50] father read the Bible.
[1:16:05] I want that to land." Amen. Come on. I
[1:16:08] want that to land.
[1:16:10] My father told
[1:16:12] me and one of the things that brother
[1:16:15] Biscoll told
[1:16:16] me he said we read our Bible in front of
[1:16:19] our
[1:16:21] family so that they may see this is
[1:16:25] something that is important in our home
[1:16:31] he said I know you'll read it privately
[1:16:33] and you'll study privately he said but
[1:16:36] our children needs to see us
[1:16:40] that it makes an impression. The most
[1:16:43] important thing we do is to read our
[1:16:47] Bibles and and pray in our homes.
[1:16:57] I went to a heart doctor just
[1:17:00] only what a month
[1:17:02] ago. He's a good doctor. He's taking
[1:17:05] care of brother Homer, Sister Nancy
[1:17:07] Thomas Harold, and he's he's our heart
[1:17:11] doctor of our
[1:17:12] family and he he's just a wonderful man.
[1:17:16] And so after I had a heart attack and
[1:17:21] they put three stints in me and one was
[1:17:24] in the widow
[1:17:25] maker. Yeah, it hurt. It really hurt
[1:17:28] really bad. I'd been at a I'd been at
[1:17:32] a how would I say it? I'd been at a ball
[1:17:35] game with Randy and Wanda and Matthew
[1:17:38] and them. And you said, "Well, Brother
[1:17:40] Ron, I I I didn't know as Christians we
[1:17:43] went to ball games. I went to watch you
[1:17:48] play." And you said, "Well, is there a
[1:17:50] quote?" Well, Brother Brandham told some
[1:17:51] boys, he said, "While you're in town, go
[1:17:53] over to Louisville and watch them boys
[1:17:55] play."
[1:17:57] Amen.
[1:18:00] And so, so anyway, that evening I would
[1:18:02] have a heart attack. They take me to the
[1:18:05] thing and I told Sister Connie, I said,
[1:18:08] "I'll go to the hospital tomorrow after
[1:18:10] I walk on I get my walking done on my
[1:18:14] treadmill." Well, had I went to my
[1:18:17] plans, I wouldn't be pastoring here
[1:18:20] today. Amen. you know, I I needed to go
[1:18:24] to the hospital because I had a massive
[1:18:27] heart attack that
[1:18:28] evening. And so and so I I went there
[1:18:32] and and one of the doctors told me said,
[1:18:35] "Do you want to kiss your wife goodbye
[1:18:38] before you before you go down this
[1:18:40] hall?" Said, "I I saw you peck her on
[1:18:41] the cheek, but you know what you got
[1:18:44] going on? You pro you may not live to
[1:18:46] come back down the hall." And I said,
[1:18:48] "Oh, I'm going to
[1:18:49] live. Yeah.
[1:18:52] And so I went to the doctor, I think
[1:18:55] about 30 days after it was Dr. Luna. I
[1:18:58] may shouldn't call their names, but I I
[1:18:59] do. And so anyway, Dr. Luna told me, he
[1:19:02] said, he said, "I I want you to go I
[1:19:05] want you to go through therapy. I want
[1:19:08] you to go through therapy, you know, the
[1:19:10] next the next six months." And I said,
[1:19:13] "Well, what does therapy do?" And he
[1:19:15] said, 'We train you to walk on a
[1:19:16] treadmill. I said, 'Well, I walk on a
[1:19:18] treadmill every day.' And he said,
[1:19:20] 'Well, he said, 'We got to train you to
[1:19:22] see if you're doing good.' And he said,
[1:19:25] uh, I said, 'Well, how long do they
[1:19:27] walk?' And he said, well, we'll get you
[1:19:29] up to 30 minutes. And I said, I already
[1:19:31] walk an hour.
[1:19:33] Come on. And he said, well, I I would
[1:19:36] like for you to do it. And I said,
[1:19:37] "Well, let me ask
[1:19:39] you. If I drive an hour for somebody to
[1:19:44] watch me walk on a treadmill for 30
[1:19:47] minutes, and then I drive a hour back
[1:19:52] home, I'm wasting two hours for you to
[1:19:55] watch me walk 30 minutes.
[1:19:59] And if I make you a
[1:20:02] promise that I'll walk an
[1:20:05] hour and not waste two hours.
[1:20:12] Does any of this make
[1:20:15] sense? What does that do? What What's
[1:20:18] that have to do with
[1:20:21] anything? Read your Bible and pray.
[1:20:26] [Applause]
[1:20:31] So, I went to see him a few weeks
[1:20:35] ago
[1:20:37] and we were
[1:20:39] talking and he said, "Well, how are you
[1:20:41] doing?" I said, "Well, I'm walking an
[1:20:43] hour a
[1:20:44] day."
[1:20:47] Really? And he said,
[1:20:49] "Well, are you really doing that?" I
[1:20:52] said, "Yeah."
[1:20:53] Thomas stopped the other day and we
[1:20:56] talked for a few minutes and I was on my
[1:20:58] three-mile
[1:20:59] walk and
[1:21:02] uh he said, "Are you really doing that?"
[1:21:06] And I said, "You told me to do it."
[1:21:10] He said, "Nobody listens to me when I
[1:21:13] tell them to do it."
[1:21:17] He said, "Wow, you're committed to do
[1:21:19] it." Oh, yeah. I said, "You told
[1:21:23] me. You told me to do it." He said,
[1:21:25] "Yeah, but nobody
[1:21:28] listens." He said,
[1:21:30] "Congratulations. You listen to me."
[1:21:36] I said, "Well, you told me and I took
[1:21:39] you at your word. You told me to take
[1:21:41] medicine and I taken the medicine. You
[1:21:43] told me to walk. I do the walking. Amen.
[1:21:48] I have just lured you into a trap.
[1:21:52] I tell you to read your Bible and pray.
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:09] Church don't start here.
[1:22:12] You want a strong church, it starts at
[1:22:15] home. Amen. It starts with your children
[1:22:19] watching you pray.
[1:22:22] It starts with your children listening
[1:22:24] to you read the Bible.
[1:22:26] It starts at home.
[1:22:29] Amen. Amen.
[1:22:36] Foundation is laid. And the scripture
[1:22:39] said, "You're the salt of the
[1:22:42] earth. You're the light of the world. a
[1:22:45] city that's set on a
[1:22:47] hill. Now, notice what he says. You're
[1:22:50] not just the light of the world. And
[1:22:52] then he says, "Let your light shine."
[1:22:56] Amen. Before men that they may
[1:23:01] see your good
[1:23:04] works, there's something different about
[1:23:08] that God.
[1:23:11] There's something different about you.
[1:23:14] I got on a
[1:23:16] plane. It's about a six-hour
[1:23:18] flight. They came on the on the speaker
[1:23:22] said, "We're we're going to have
[1:23:24] incredible turbulence
[1:23:31] today." The lady walked past me and she
[1:23:33] said,
[1:23:35] "Preacher," she said, "Would you pray?"
[1:23:41] I said, "Sure." She said, 'It's going to
[1:23:43] be a bad flight. Would you pray? The man
[1:23:47] in front of me was a
[1:23:52] preacher. And I told her, I said, "The
[1:23:56] man up here is a preacher. I can see you
[1:23:58] studying for a sermon." And she
[1:24:01] whispered in my ear, she said, "Some
[1:24:03] preachers are real.
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:20] That's an incredible testimony. Not just
[1:24:22] for me.
[1:24:26] Are you with me? Whether you work in
[1:24:28] radiology,
[1:24:32] no matter where you work at,
[1:24:36] I want you to be real. Amen. Amen. Real.
[1:24:42] Amen. Amen.
[1:24:44] Romans chapter 10 and
[1:24:47] verse
[1:24:49] 13. For whosoever shall call on the name
[1:24:52] of the Lord shall be
[1:24:56] saved. And then how then shall we call
[1:25:00] on
[1:25:01] him whom they have not believed?
[1:25:05] And how shall they believe in him of
[1:25:08] whom they shall not have not heard? And
[1:25:12] how shall they hear without a preacher?
[1:25:17] And how shall they preach except they be
[1:25:20] sent?
[1:25:22] As it is written, how beautiful are the
[1:25:26] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:25:28] peace and glad tidings of good things.
[1:25:33] Oh yeah. Let me just say this is the
[1:25:35] best thing that you can heal.
[1:25:40] Are you with me now?
[1:25:45] In Mark chapter 16 and verse
[1:25:50] 15, go ye into all the world. This is
[1:25:53] Jesus's last
[1:25:57] words in the four gospels. It's going to
[1:26:00] have some words in Acts chapter
[1:26:03] 1. Ye go ye into all the world and
[1:26:08] preach the gospel to every preacher.
[1:26:12] And he that
[1:26:15] believeth and is
[1:26:17] baptized shall be saved.
[1:26:20] And he that believeth not shall be
[1:26:24] damned. It It's just real simple.
[1:26:27] I want to be identified as a believer.
[1:26:33] Now notice this next words. And these
[1:26:36] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:26:42] Not the signs out front, not the
[1:26:45] miracles out front, but the miracles are
[1:26:48] going to follow your life. Amen.
[1:26:54] And these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:56] believe. Notice these words. In my name
[1:27:00] shall they cast out devils, and they
[1:27:02] shall speak with new tongues, and they
[1:27:05] shall take up serpents, and if they
[1:27:07] drink any deadly thing, they shall not
[1:27:10] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:27:14] sick, and they shall recover.
[1:27:19] That's right. Amen.
[1:27:27] Mark 16 and verse 19. And then after the
[1:27:31] Lord had spoken unto them, he was
[1:27:35] received up into
[1:27:36] heaven and sat on the right hand of God.
[1:27:41] So then after the Lord had spoken that
[1:27:43] to
[1:27:44] them and was received up into heaven and
[1:27:48] sat on the right hand of God. That
[1:27:50] computer must have said, I want you to
[1:27:52] read that twice.
[1:27:56] Verse 20. And they went forth
[1:28:01] and preached everywhere. Now notice this
[1:28:03] is action.
[1:28:06] They just didn't hear it. But now it's
[1:28:09] action. and they went forth and preached
[1:28:12] everywhere. That's what Andrew is doing
[1:28:14] this weekend. Amen. And and and the Lord
[1:28:17] working with them and confirming the
[1:28:20] word with signs following and even God
[1:28:24] amens. Amen.
[1:28:28] Luke chap 10 and verse 19. This is
[1:28:31] Jesus's word. Behold, I give unto you
[1:28:35] power which is not just dunamis.
[1:28:39] It's authority.
[1:28:41] I give unto you power to tread upon
[1:28:45] serpents. You heard Andrew preach a
[1:28:47] couple of weeks ago, the devil's under
[1:28:49] your feet. Then then Timothy came and
[1:28:54] said, even if you're the skin on the
[1:28:56] bottom of your feet, you still are over
[1:28:58] the devil.
[1:29:02] I give you power to tread upon serpents
[1:29:05] and scorpions and over the power of the
[1:29:09] enemy and nothing shall by any means
[1:29:14] hurt you.
[1:29:18] Amen. I want you to I want you to just
[1:29:21] look at your Bible just now. Is there a
[1:29:24] time date stamp?
[1:29:29] in any of your Bibles.
[1:29:32] Does that mean that this scripture
[1:29:34] expires?
[1:29:39] So, it's good in Paul's day.
[1:29:43] It's good in Irene's day.
[1:29:46] It's good in Martin's day and Luther's
[1:29:48] day and John Wesley's day. Amen.
[1:29:52] And you say, "Well, Brother Ron, over 6
[1:29:55] million Christians gave their life. 68
[1:29:59] million Christians gave their life. 6
[1:30:01] million Jews gave their life.
[1:30:06] What a horrible way to go. You're not
[1:30:08] reading it right.
[1:30:11] They didn't die in defeat.
[1:30:16] Are you with me?" Amen. Listen, death
[1:30:19] for a Christian is not defeat.
[1:30:23] We die in faith.
[1:30:28] I preached 19 funerals here the first
[1:30:30] year I was
[1:30:32] here. They didn't die in defeat.
[1:30:39] Death is an Uber.
[1:30:42] Amen. For those that are uses older,
[1:30:45] death is a toxic
[1:30:52] catap. Some of you haven't known me
[1:30:54] long.
[1:30:57] When I was a young meat
[1:30:59] cutter, somewhere around 21, 22 years
[1:31:02] old, me and Connie got married, you
[1:31:05] know, people would scream out, "What's
[1:31:07] the taxis number?"
[1:31:11] I was a young
[1:31:15] Christian and I knew Hubert Horn's
[1:31:18] funeral homes number by
[1:31:25] heart and I would give them a Hubert
[1:31:28] Horns funeral home's
[1:31:32] number and they would tell me you gave
[1:31:35] me a funeral home's number. It's a taxi.
[1:31:43] You got to be specific. What kind of tax
[1:31:46] do you want to go on?
[1:31:54] You want one that's
[1:31:56] yellow or do you want one
[1:32:01] that's maybe I better move
[1:32:06] on. So that just gives you proof. Don't
[1:32:09] ask brother Ron for a taxi
[1:32:17] number. Not
[1:32:19] with Notwithstanding in this
[1:32:22] rejoice. Rejoice not that spirits are
[1:32:27] subject unto
[1:32:29] you, but rather rejoice.
[1:32:34] This is powerful
[1:32:36] because your names
[1:32:38] are written in heaven.
[1:32:46] What does that have to do with the first
[1:32:48] words that you read about the
[1:32:51] tongue? You see, you're going to need
[1:32:54] some some ranks. Amen. And a bit
[1:33:00] for your mouth.
[1:33:03] And those that
[1:33:05] have Sister Stephanie, you guys are
[1:33:07] horse people. And I would grew up with
[1:33:10] horses. We grew up with uh what's a good
[1:33:13] word for pinto paint. Is that paint
[1:33:16] horse? We had paint horses. And they're
[1:33:20] beautiful horses. And so, you know, for
[1:33:23] to tell that horse where to go is you're
[1:33:26] going to have to have ress on him.
[1:33:28] and you you put a bit in its mouth and
[1:33:32] then you take that bit and you turn that
[1:33:35] horse the way that you want to do. And
[1:33:38] we raise cutting horses. And so you
[1:33:41] could take that cutting horse and if it
[1:33:43] was trained really well, he would stand
[1:33:45] on his back feet, especially his right
[1:33:48] foot, and you could turn him. And
[1:33:50] literally, we would be running and you
[1:33:52] could turn that horse like that. And you
[1:33:55] would be in midair with that right foot
[1:33:58] on the ground and he would turn. It was
[1:34:01] wonderful. I mean, it was wonderful.
[1:34:04] You'd be flying and that cow would turn
[1:34:06] a certain way and you could turn that
[1:34:09] horse a certain way. Your tongue
[1:34:13] needs a bit.
[1:34:19] Your tongue needs a bit and the Holy
[1:34:23] Ghost just a bit.
[1:34:26] And the inner man takes that tongue that
[1:34:29] used to have an attitude
[1:34:32] and you and you used to think I'm going
[1:34:34] to give him a piece in my mind. Keep it.
[1:34:39] You need every brain cell that you can
[1:34:41] muster up.
[1:34:45] And you need the Holy Ghost, God in your
[1:34:48] life.
[1:34:49] You could do more damage in five minutes
[1:34:52] than you can do in 10 years.
[1:34:55] Somebody ought to give the Lord a good
[1:34:57] hand right
[1:35:06] there. Joshua chapter 23 and verse
[1:35:10] 10. Now this is a powerful scripture.
[1:35:16] One man of
[1:35:19] you shall chase a
[1:35:23] thousand for the Lord your
[1:35:26] God. Brother Doug, you are a you're a
[1:35:31] historian and someday I want to I want
[1:35:33] to go with you someday and you can
[1:35:35] explain to me some of these Civil War
[1:35:36] battles.
[1:35:39] But think about the
[1:35:41] power of one
[1:35:43] man chasing a
[1:35:49] thousand. Dylan, you were a
[1:35:52] fighter. Yeah, he was. That's why you
[1:35:55] went to
[1:35:59] jail. And your daddy taught you how to
[1:36:02] fight. I'm just go ahead bring them all
[1:36:04] in. You know, you your face is red, but
[1:36:11] There's some other fighters in the room,
[1:36:12] but I want to get in that car and go
[1:36:26] home. Might have heard some stories
[1:36:29] that that two or three wasn't
[1:36:33] enough. But can you imagine a thousand
[1:36:39] Can you imagine a
[1:36:41] thousand in a battle?
[1:36:45] And they're all against you. Amen.
[1:36:50] Hey, listen. I I'm not up for that. I'll
[1:36:53] be honest with you. Physically, I'm not
[1:36:55] up for
[1:36:57] that. Spiritually,
[1:37:00] bring them on.
[1:37:03] Bring them on.
[1:37:14] Brother Ron, that's just boasting. Well,
[1:37:16] he brought his best called cancer.
[1:37:21] He brought his best called cancer. And I
[1:37:24] don't know how many demons that he
[1:37:26] brought with him.
[1:37:31] Take courage, Sister Wanda. I don't know
[1:37:33] how many demons that he brought with
[1:37:34] him, but in my
[1:37:37] physical, it's been some really bad
[1:37:39] days. But in this word of God, one will
[1:37:43] chase a thousand.
[1:37:46] [Applause]
[1:37:56] Now, you brought this sermon on. You
[1:37:58] came up and asked for prayer, a prayer
[1:38:00] request. And I stood there and I gave
[1:38:03] you some
[1:38:06] instructions. Ain't that right? Now, in
[1:38:10] your physical being, you can whip no
[1:38:13] devils.
[1:38:14] Cuz it's not a flesh and blood affair.
[1:38:19] This is a war
[1:38:22] that you're fighting against.
[1:38:25] Moms and dads, this is a war.
[1:38:28] Your children will have to fight things
[1:38:30] that you never fought.
[1:38:34] How you will
[1:38:36] win is being deeply committed.
[1:38:42] Deeply committed. This is life and
[1:38:45] death.
[1:38:47] How you will win is on your knees
[1:38:52] and taking the word of God and quoting
[1:38:55] it back to the devil.
[1:39:03] Have you ever heard of prisoners of war?
[1:39:10] We have heard it over and over again
[1:39:11] that prisoners of war that was in
[1:39:13] different
[1:39:15] prisons. Maybe when they were children,
[1:39:18] they went to
[1:39:20] church and they would memorize
[1:39:22] scriptures.
[1:39:30] John, and I'm having trouble with my
[1:39:33] memory, but he just passed away just a
[1:39:35] couple of years ago. He ran for
[1:39:39] president. John
[1:39:41] McCain. In one of his stories he
[1:39:45] told, he said, "We didn't have any
[1:39:48] books. We had nothing to read.
[1:39:52] We would have went
[1:39:54] insane. But we as
[1:39:57] prisoners begin to put scriptures
[1:40:01] together that we couldn't memorize them
[1:40:05] all by heart, but maybe we had one or
[1:40:07] two words of a certain scripture and we
[1:40:10] begin to quote that and then somebody
[1:40:12] else would remember the And he said,
[1:40:14] "Before long, we had almost a booklet
[1:40:17] that we quoted every day of scriptures.
[1:40:27] It kept them sane. It works in a prison.
[1:40:32] It works wherever you at. This word has
[1:40:36] power over the devil.
[1:40:42] I quoted scriptures on my way to to a
[1:40:47] brain surgery.
[1:40:50] I took the word of God, not knowing if I
[1:40:53] would live through it, but I took the
[1:40:56] word of God and quoted it with the most
[1:40:58] powerful thing I had, my tongue.
[1:41:06] God loves to hear his word come out of
[1:41:09] your lips. Amen.
[1:41:13] If we could say it
[1:41:15] correctly, your mouth has miracles in
[1:41:19] it.
[1:41:22] Your mouth has
[1:41:26] miracles inside of it.
[1:41:40] Psalms 118 and verse
[1:41:43] 14. We're going to read this together. I
[1:41:46] won't be much
[1:41:56] longer. Let's do some practice.
[1:42:00] The Lord is the strength of my The Lord
[1:42:04] is my strength.
[1:42:06] and my song
[1:42:08] and has become my salvation.
[1:42:14] The voice of rejoicing and salvation is
[1:42:18] in tabernacles of righteousness. The
[1:42:22] right hand of the Lord doth
[1:42:27] valiantly. This is one of my next
[1:42:30] scriptures that I absolutely love. Verse
[1:42:39] 17. Now you can see what's one of my
[1:42:42] favorite scriptures.
[1:42:44] I shall not die
[1:42:47] but live and declare the works of the
[1:42:52] Lord.
[1:43:06] For you that never have fought the enemy
[1:43:08] of
[1:43:09] disease, that is a powerful
[1:43:14] scripture.
[1:43:17] I shall not die
[1:43:22] but
[1:43:25] live.
[1:43:28] Verse 18. The Lord hath chasened me
[1:43:34] sore, but he hath not given me over to
[1:43:39] death.
[1:43:42] You've not had my funeral yet.
[1:43:46] Conniey's not looking for another
[1:43:50] man. I'm not buried up in some hill
[1:43:54] somewhere or another.
[1:43:57] So I am still here
[1:43:59] to work
[1:44:03] I am still here to defeat the devil.
[1:44:07] [Applause]
[1:44:23] Now, if I'm still
[1:44:25] here and you're still here,
[1:44:30] point your finger to your
[1:44:35] chest. The devil's in trouble
[1:44:39] cuz we got a pretty vicious team here.
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:57] Some of you drive 10 minutes. Some of
[1:44:59] you drive two hours. Some of you drive
[1:45:02] four
[1:45:03] hours. If I drove four hours in a sports
[1:45:06] car like you drove today, I'd be ready.
[1:45:12] I walked around the curb this morning
[1:45:14] and there was two sports
[1:45:16] cars and I said, "Connie, I got to get
[1:45:19] me a sports car. I must be going through
[1:45:22] the change of
[1:45:25] life." One of these days you're going to
[1:45:27] walk around that curb and go, "Woo!
[1:45:29] Brother Ron did what he said he's going
[1:45:31] to
[1:45:34] do." Conniey's shaking her head. Sister
[1:45:37] Nancy Sister Nancy is going to get one.
[1:45:40] I can get
[1:45:41] [Laughter]
[1:45:44] [Applause]
[1:45:55] in. If I don't live through this
[1:46:01] service, Luke chapter 1 and verse
[1:46:06] 37. Sometimes you just have a good time,
[1:46:08] Jay. You just You just got to have a
[1:46:10] good time. For with God, I want you to
[1:46:14] read this. For with
[1:46:17] God nothing shall be impossible.
[1:46:25] Read it with me. For with God
[1:46:29] nothing,
[1:46:34] nothing.
[1:46:36] Nothing.
[1:46:40] Now, here's what the devil will do. He
[1:46:42] knows that scripture is totally
[1:46:45] accurate.
[1:46:48] So, he will tell you you're not a
[1:46:50] Christian.
[1:46:51] He will tell you that nobody loves you.
[1:46:57] So, instead of you throwing a rock at
[1:46:59] the devil,
[1:47:01] he'll get you to throw rocks at each
[1:47:05] other. Amen.
[1:47:10] Hey, I'm preaching.
[1:47:13] The devil wins when you're throwing
[1:47:15] rocks at each other.
[1:47:18] Are you with me? Now, it's easy to throw
[1:47:21] a rock at me. I'm 5 foot five, weigh 172
[1:47:25] pounds. That's what it was this
[1:47:27] morning. It's easy to hit me. I'm
[1:47:30] standing up here.
[1:47:33] I'm the one trying to help you. It's
[1:47:36] easy to talk about the doctor or the
[1:47:38] nurse or somebody that gave you a shot,
[1:47:43] but they're doing their best for you.
[1:47:48] It's easy to talk about me. The devil
[1:47:51] throws a rock at me
[1:47:53] cuz I'm trying to help you.
[1:47:58] The devil will try to cut you out of
[1:48:02] church. Amen.
[1:48:05] It's what's kept your life straight.
[1:48:07] It's what's helped you. It's helped you
[1:48:09] build a family.
[1:48:12] People say, "Well, I'm quitting going to
[1:48:13] church." You don't quit going to
[1:48:14] Walmart.
[1:48:23] Have you looked at the people that go to
[1:48:25] Walmart? They're not trying to help you.
[1:48:28] They're just shopping with you.
[1:48:32] We are a team.
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:43] We're on your team.
[1:48:48] We're on your team.
[1:48:52] Brother Ron, why did you have all those
[1:48:53] people to come up? I didn't do that for
[1:48:55] a show. Amen. We're on a team together.
[1:48:59] That's right. Amen.
[1:49:05] And want to put a flight a thousand and
[1:49:08] two 10,000.
[1:49:10] How many was there? 15 people.
[1:49:20] We're a team.
[1:49:23] Brother Melvin, you didn't come here
[1:49:26] just to get a good church. But there's a
[1:49:29] team with you.
[1:49:40] The guy you're sitting with, Brother
[1:49:42] Jordan, he's been here probably 5 years
[1:49:44] longer than you have, maybe longer than
[1:49:46] that, but he knows what a team that
[1:49:49] we've got here.
[1:49:51] Thank you, Lord. This is more than a
[1:49:52] church community.
[1:49:55] We're the strongest people on the earth.
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:02] Brother Jordan, when I watched your
[1:50:04] children come to the altar and I prayed
[1:50:06] for you at the altar last week, it was
[1:50:11] like one of my children. Amen.
[1:50:18] Why, brother Ron, we can't go without
[1:50:21] you.
[1:50:25] Understand it's not just some individual
[1:50:28] here. We are a group of believers.
[1:50:33] Amen. We need one another.
[1:50:39] Do you get it? Turn. Just turn to your
[1:50:40] neighbor right now. Say, "We're a team
[1:50:43] and we need one another.
[1:51:03] Romans chapter 8 and verse
[1:51:08] 28. Let's go ahead and kill about 10,000
[1:51:11] more devils and then we're going to
[1:51:13] we're going to be done.
[1:51:20] Amen. Romans 8 and verse
[1:51:23] 28. Love on my mind and can't find what
[1:51:28] I'm looking
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:36] for. Some of you never get it, but the
[1:51:39] one that did get it is get it.
[1:51:45] See, I was drunk the last few days. And
[1:51:47] just say, "Brother Ron was drunk in the
[1:51:48] pull pit today."
[1:51:49] [Applause]
[1:51:58] Romans 8 and verse 28
[1:52:00] says, "And we
[1:52:03] know that all things
[1:52:08] all things
[1:52:10] work together for good to them that love
[1:52:15] God, to them who are be called according
[1:52:21] to his purpose.
[1:52:24] Amen.
[1:52:28] Understand every trial that you go
[1:52:31] through is building you and making you
[1:52:34] stronger for the next trial.
[1:52:39] You that been Christians for a while,
[1:52:41] you know this is the principle of how it
[1:52:43] happened. Amen.
[1:52:46] Brother Tom Brown said, "Brother Ron,
[1:52:47] you ought to make a list that people can
[1:52:50] see in your church all the things that
[1:52:52] you went through." So he therefore would
[1:52:55] send it if he thought I was preaching in
[1:52:57] South Carolina would send it to the
[1:53:00] pastor and said, "You need to read this
[1:53:02] before brother Ron
[1:53:05] preaches." So they would read it. Fell
[1:53:09] off a house 40T. Said he'd never walk
[1:53:12] again.
[1:53:14] Come on.
[1:53:18] Hit by lightning. Hey, I didn't like it.
[1:53:23] And so they told it in front of me
[1:53:25] preaching in Indiana and they wanted me
[1:53:28] to tell it again. So I did. Was any of
[1:53:30] you guys there? Randy, you were there. I
[1:53:32] know you were there. I'll never forget
[1:53:34] it. I told it. I told it about about
[1:53:38] getting hit by lightning and it hit the
[1:53:40] tree beside of me and then it hit me and
[1:53:43] knocked me out and when I came to it had
[1:53:46] knocked the end of my weed eater off.
[1:53:49] Amen.
[1:53:52] Well, I told that story, Brother Vernon,
[1:53:55] and outside of church was two little
[1:53:57] boys and they met me outside and said,
[1:54:00] "Did it really knock the end of your
[1:54:02] weed eater off?" That's all they got out
[1:54:04] of the
[1:54:06] story. That's all they
[1:54:10] got. They wasn't worried about the tree.
[1:54:12] They wasn't worried about brother Ron
[1:54:15] the weed
[1:54:16] eater. So if you need details, it was a
[1:54:21] shindawa. And it knocked the end of that
[1:54:23] weed eater just slick as a button. It
[1:54:25] knocked it right off. But hey, I was in
[1:54:28] the story.
[1:54:37] Now notice the scripture. All things.
[1:54:42] All things. So what did that what did
[1:54:45] that lightning strike do for me? It made
[1:54:48] me to have enough sense to get out of a
[1:54:52] storm.
[1:54:54] Amen.
[1:54:58] Sister Connie said, "You need to get
[1:54:59] those weeds cut off before brother
[1:55:02] Biscll comes to the house tomorrow." So,
[1:55:04] I put my ear muffs on. I went down and I
[1:55:07] cut all those
[1:55:09] weeds except for the ones I had left.
[1:55:15] So now I just have Adam to cut the
[1:55:18] weeds.
[1:55:26] For whom he
[1:55:28] forno he also did
[1:55:31] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:55:33] image of his son that he might be the
[1:55:36] firstborn among many brethren. And
[1:55:39] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:55:41] he also
[1:55:43] called. And and whom he called them he
[1:55:46] also justified. and whom he justified,
[1:55:49] then he also glorified.
[1:55:52] This scripture is so powerful if he can
[1:55:55] get it.
[1:55:57] If he justified you, it's as though you
[1:56:00] never did it in the first place.
[1:56:05] So, some of you got histories like me
[1:56:07] and God wipes it all away.
[1:56:13] And when he justified, then he also
[1:56:15] glorified. Yeah. So, it means in God's
[1:56:18] mind, I'm already there.
[1:56:23] I can't lose.
[1:56:26] I know this is a simple sermon.
[1:56:30] But, Brother Marcus, if we can get the
[1:56:32] point,
[1:56:34] God is our strength. We're already there
[1:56:38] in God's mind. He's going to get us
[1:56:41] through every trial.
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:57] So what does that mean? It doesn't
[1:56:59] matter what people say about you on
[1:57:01] Facebook.
[1:57:06] It doesn't matter what anybody says
[1:57:09] about you on the job.
[1:57:13] Hey, I'm digging.
[1:57:16] It doesn't matter what anybody says to
[1:57:21] try to destroy you. You have already
[1:57:26] won.
[1:57:37] Did you get it?
[1:57:40] Did you get it? That's right.
[1:57:49] So, I was worried about some of you
[1:57:52] riding two hours to
[1:57:55] church. And one of your brothers looked
[1:57:57] at me and he said, "We used to ride two
[1:57:59] hours in a buggy."
[1:58:01] That's right.
[1:58:05] And now we ride two hours. This is what
[1:58:07] he said. We read we ride two hours that
[1:58:11] tells us about a rapture.
[1:58:15] It's a good tradeoff.
[1:58:20] It's a really good tradeoff.
[1:58:23] You ride four and a half
[1:58:27] hours. It's a good deal.
[1:58:30] That's right.
[1:58:32] It's a really good deal. Amen. I was
[1:58:37] thinking about you the other day,
[1:58:38] Brother Ron.
[1:58:41] I was really thinking about
[1:58:42] you. I was thinking about that quote
[1:58:44] where Brother Brandon said, "Travel like
[1:58:46] a thought." That'd be a really neat
[1:58:48] deal. Travel like a thought. We could
[1:58:50] use that right now.
[1:58:53] Amen. And I sat down in the cancer
[1:58:57] center and I sat beside of a guy that
[1:59:01] rides four and a half hours to see the
[1:59:04] same doctor that I do.
[1:59:08] And listen, I got a good doctor. I
[1:59:10] really do. I got a good
[1:59:13] doctor, but she's a practicing
[1:59:17] physician. She probably won't even come
[1:59:19] to a funeral.
[1:59:21] But you know that guy rides four and a
[1:59:24] half hours and they've give him no
[1:59:27] promise either. Literally no promise.
[1:59:29] They're just doing the best they can
[1:59:31] help. But you drive four and a half
[1:59:35] hours and you have discovered that my
[1:59:39] history is gone.
[1:59:44] Listen, this is a pretty good job,
[1:59:46] Heather. You come here and sit down and
[1:59:49] and your history is evaporated.
[1:59:55] It's gone. And your future is clear.
[2:00:04] I can tell you with assurance we're
[2:00:07] going to sit at the marriage supper of
[2:00:09] the lamb.
[2:00:16] And this won't mean nothing.
[2:00:21] This won't mean
[2:00:24] absolutely nothing.
[2:00:30] I'm going to preach in a few weeks to
[2:00:33] you about your fall. I may preach to you
[2:00:36] next week. Your flaw evaporated.
[2:00:41] Okay? People have memories. I'll give
[2:00:44] you a little prep. People have memories
[2:00:47] about you and they have memories about
[2:00:50] maybe maybe where you fell in your life
[2:00:53] and
[2:00:55] maybe I don't know let's just say you
[2:00:57] were a bank
[2:01:00] robber if you was I
[2:01:05] sorry you said why you say that brother
[2:01:07] Ron there was my
[2:01:09] uncle that came down to his
[2:01:13] deathbed and he was with my
[2:01:18] dad and he said, "Charlie, I need to
[2:01:21] tell you something." And dad said,
[2:01:23] "Okay, you can tell me
[2:01:26] anything." He said, "30 years
[2:01:29] ago, me and two of my
[2:01:31] friends robbed a
[2:01:34] bank." Dad said, "Really?"
[2:01:40] He said, "I've never told any of my
[2:01:43] family, but I got to confess it, and
[2:01:47] you're the
[2:01:49] preacher." And dad said, "Well, what can
[2:01:52] I do with
[2:01:54] that?" And dad looked at him and said,
[2:01:58] "Well, I forgive you." And he said,
[2:02:00] "Thank you."
[2:02:04] In a few minutes, he was
[2:02:07] gone. And brother Ray, I give it a lot
[2:02:11] of
[2:02:12] thought. About two weeks ago, the Lord
[2:02:15] dealt with me about the flaw
[2:02:20] gone in your life. You may remember the
[2:02:26] flaw bank
[2:02:29] robber and it may battle you every time
[2:02:32] you pray. Amen.
[2:02:36] But in just seconds going into that new
[2:02:40] body, the old
[2:02:42] body that robbed the bank is history.
[2:02:48] And the new body, Woo, I feel like
[2:02:50] shouting. and a new body. It is never
[2:02:54] held against him ever again.
[2:03:07] Glory.
[2:03:14] Glory. Well, ain't no need trying to add
[2:03:16] anything to
[2:03:18] that. Musicians come
[2:03:24] That makes me feel like just shouting
[2:03:25] all over this building right
[2:03:31] there cuz I asked God to wipe my memory
[2:03:36] to where I don't even remember those bad
[2:03:38] things anymore. And he's really helped
[2:03:40] me with that. When something comes up,
[2:03:43] you know, why did I remember that? And
[2:03:45] I'll just say, Lord, would you delete
[2:03:48] that? Would you take away that?
[2:03:50] And the Lord some way helps me forget
[2:03:53] those things. When that pops back up, I
[2:03:55] say, "Lord, would you help me forget
[2:03:57] that memory? Help me just wipe that
[2:04:00] away. Tear that page."
[2:04:03] Believe that'll be a good sermon next
[2:04:04] week. Let's stand.
[2:04:19] verse 35, chapter 8,
[2:04:23] Romans. I want us to read this together
[2:04:26] through the rest of the
[2:04:28] verses. Who shall separate us from the
[2:04:31] love of God?
[2:04:33] shall tribulation or distress or
[2:04:37] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[2:04:41] peril or
[2:04:43] sword. As it is written, for thy sake
[2:04:46] we're killed all the day long. We're
[2:04:50] accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
[2:04:52] Nay, in all these things we are more
[2:04:55] than conquerors through him that loved
[2:04:58] us. For I am persuaded
[2:05:03] nor life, nor angels, nor
[2:05:05] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[2:05:08] present, nor things to
[2:05:11] come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
[2:05:15] other creature shall be able to separate
[2:05:18] us from the love of God, which is in
[2:05:20] Christ Jesus.
[2:05:23] Won't you give your neighbor a high five
[2:05:25] right
[2:05:28] now? Some of you gave him a low five. I
[2:05:31] guess that'll count.
[2:05:34] But go ahead and really give them a high
[2:05:37] fab right
[2:05:44] now. We win.
[2:05:48] We win.
[2:05:54] We win.
[2:06:03] Tell your neighbor, "We win."
[2:06:12] And just in case they have forgot, I
[2:06:15] want you to tell your neighbor, "We're
[2:06:16] on the same team."
[2:06:26] We're on the same team.
[2:06:29] So when you you text us and
[2:06:32] said we'll take her to the
[2:06:34] hospital, you didn't only take her but
[2:06:37] all of us went to
[2:06:43] prayer. We went to
[2:06:45] prayer cuz the highest physician is
[2:06:49] there when we call him.
[2:06:53] Many miracles don't happen because we
[2:06:55] don't ask. Come on.
[2:07:00] Ask
[2:07:02] and you shall receive. That's right.
[2:07:05] Seek and you shall find.
[2:07:09] Forgive your brother that you might be
[2:07:12] forgiven.
[2:07:14] Give them mercy that you can receive
[2:07:17] mercy.
[2:07:22] I don't know how you feel right now, but
[2:07:24] I may be a little dizzy.
[2:07:27] I hope you're not.
[2:07:30] But it's been good to be in the house of
[2:07:31] the Lord.
[2:07:36] I'm so glad that the Lord he brought me
[2:07:40] out. Well, I'm so glad that the Lord
[2:07:44] brought me
[2:07:46] out. If it had not been for
[2:07:50] Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad
[2:07:55] that the Lord brought me
[2:07:58] out. Well, I'm so happy since the Lord
[2:08:02] brought me
[2:08:04] out. Oh, I'm so happy that the Lord
[2:08:09] brought me
[2:08:11] out. Oh, if it had not been for
[2:08:15] Jesus, where would I be? I'm so glad
[2:08:20] that the Lord brought me out. Aren't you
[2:08:24] glad? Oh, aren't you glad that the Lord
[2:08:28] He brought you
[2:08:30] out? Oh, aren't you glad that the Lord
[2:08:35] brought me
[2:08:35] [Applause]
[2:08:37] out? Oh, if it had not been Jesus, oh,
[2:08:42] where would I be? I'm so glad.
[2:08:47] Oh, let's sing it again. I'm so
[2:08:50] glad. Well, I'm so glad that the Lord He
[2:08:54] brought me
[2:08:56] out. Oh, I'm so glad that the Lord
[2:09:01] brought me out.
[2:09:04] Oh, if it had not been
[2:09:08] Jesus, where would I
[2:09:12] be that the Lord brought me
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:19] out? Aren't you glad of that this
[2:09:21] morning that he brought you out? When we
[2:09:24] all get to heaven,
[2:09:27] sing the wondrous love of Jesus.
[2:09:32] See his
[2:09:34] mercy and his reign. Oh, in the
[2:09:40] meious bright and
[2:09:43] blessing, he'll prepare for us.
[2:09:48] Please, hoping we
[2:09:51] all will get to
[2:09:54] him. What a day of rejoicing that will
[2:09:59] be.
[2:10:01] Hoping we
[2:10:03] hope for seeking
[2:10:07] Jesus we will sing and shout the
[2:10:11] victory.
[2:10:14] While we walk the hill from
[2:10:20] pathway, glass will
[2:10:23] over spread the sky. For the
[2:10:30] relying, days are
[2:10:33] over now. A shackle, not a
[2:10:38] sound. Open
[2:10:41] we get to him.
[2:10:45] What a day of rejoicing that will
[2:10:50] be. Oh, bring me
[2:10:53] home. Oh, seeing
[2:10:57] Jesus, we will sing and shout the
[2:11:01] victory.
[2:11:03] [Music]
[2:11:05] Let us
[2:11:07] be true and
[2:11:11] faithful
[2:11:14] trusting every day. Oh, just one lives
[2:11:20] of him in
[2:11:24] glory with the toes of life prevail.
[2:11:28] [Music]
[2:11:30] When we
[2:11:32] are opening to
[2:11:35] him, what a day of rejoicing that will
[2:11:42] be. For we
[2:11:45] are all seeking
[2:11:48] Jesus, we will sing and shout. For when
[2:11:53] we
[2:11:54] are open we
[2:11:58] are open to
[2:12:01] him. What a day of rejoicing that will
[2:12:07] be. Oh we
[2:12:10] hope for seeking
[2:12:14] Jesus we will
[2:12:17] see you're dismissed this morning. God
[2:12:20] richly bless you. Opening we
[2:12:24] all came to
[2:12:27] him. What a day of rejoicing that will
[2:12:33] be. Glory
[2:12:37] we all seeking
[2:12:40] Jesus. We will sing and we'll shout
[2:12:47] victory. Heat. Heat.
[2:12:51] [Music]
