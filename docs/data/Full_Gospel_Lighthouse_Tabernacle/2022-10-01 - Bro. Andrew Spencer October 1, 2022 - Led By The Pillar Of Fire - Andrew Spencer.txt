tomorrow morning's service that after service will be having our baptismal Service A New Beginning service and and there's quite a few that have desired to be baptized and we just ask that if you desire to be baptized to to come with a repentant heart and you do your part and God will do his and uh if you desire to be baptized just a reminder to bring a change of clothes bring a towel and if you will be taking there will be brothers and sisters or sister Connie or sister Katie will be taken pictures but if you desire to have your own camera bring that the streaming will be cut off after the service while the baptismal service is going on and so if you if anybody would desire to change into their baptism close before you can do that at the back and then make your way make your way up this way and then we'll just bring you in an orderly fashion we were able to uh Sister Mary Vance Frazier had desired to be baptized and she had no idea that we were going to have this service or have a baptismal service but she had text sister Katie um that day or the day of and was asking if she could be baptized well remember we were taking communion and and she she didn't catch she didn't catch that part so God was working on both ends but because of her work schedule she wouldn't have been able to be here so we were able to baptize Sister Mary Frazier on the river this this past week and also brother Vijay Frazier and you know God's already these brothers and sisters have already got got it started and the angels in the waters and so we're just we're looking under the horn [Applause] when you see a pastor come under a burden like that you recognize that it's the Lord that is behind it and you see people's hearts that have been been sitting here for 30 and 40 years that that have come under a burden to just to have a new beginning you watch that the Lord is behind it and tomorrow we'll see the fruition of this desire but we're just certainly thankful that God has counted us worthy to be standing and to living this life a life that is worthy of the Gospel happy to have brother brother Fred back in the house of the Lord and sister Linda after her surgery yesterday so we're certainly thankful certainly thankful for our Lord Jesus Christ to be here this evening amen that's the one that we're counting on this evening to come by our way I'm happy to have our pastor back

ownership of this body of Believers here tonight Lord you've come Lord Jesus to to make yourself alone in the body Lord One More Time Lord as we would yield our vessels father to hear from you Lord Jesus we recognize that you are building a body Lord your stacking Sail on top of cell by the word of Truth Lord we pray Lord Jesus as we would walk and talk with you tonight Lord we would ask Lord

come and speak to us through thy Living Word we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have your Bibles this evening would like to look over in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 and to Exodus chapter 13 verse 21. I would like to speak to you this evening on led by the pillar of Fire led by the pillar of Fire Genesis chapter 1 and verse 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God and moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light Exodus chapter 13 and verse 21. and say Amen when you have it this evening and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night and he took not away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people may God bless his word he may be exceeded in the presence of the Lord so said we'd like to speak to you this evening on lead by the pillar of Fire and brother Burnham said in the anointed ones at the end time he said I wasn't the one that appeared down there on the river he said I was only standing there when he appeared he said I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are I am only the one that's nearer when he does it I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to that he spoke through it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ let's say that together the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man you're not feeding on a man a man's words his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man the son of man is Christ and you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man and if you haven't fed fully if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to fly above all of these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray and we recognize that that the children of Israel after they've been after they've been drawn out of Egypt that God how that he'd come down through the miraculous works of the supernatural that we recognize that that Moses had a meeting up there but you you watch as as Moses comes back down he's got a vision he's got a vision that is before him that no matter what goes on and no matter what happens who the children of Israel along that path he knows that he's coming back to worship on that Mountain that no matter no matter what they come up against as far as opposition no matter what Pharaoh said about them no matter how long Pharaoh held them down there in Egypt no matter how many plagues that God had to show forth God God had given Moses a vision that he was going to go back to that mountain and he was going to Worship On That Mountain and you know as a children of the Living God that God has given you a promise that you are going to be able to worship Him in spirit and in truth and no matter how many men have tried to come in with intellectual ideas you know that the air is a powerful word that is given to the Church of the Living God that you are going to be worth be able to worship Him in spirit and in truth and no matter how many obstacles that had came against the Church of the Living God as they were moving out there in Israel when they were moving out there God that God had already give them a promise that he was going to be with them he was going to to guide them and he was going to lead them notice they were not under the leadership of Moses because if they were under the leadership of man man would have took him on a 10-day journey and he would have went on in to the promised land but God was doing some wondering he led the children of Israel allowed them to wander throughout there to get all of the excess cut off of them to get all the unbelievers out there and notice the True Church of the Living God was their Journey Through the Wilderness for 40 years and they never had to go by Walmart they never had to go by a department store they never had to go by a hospital because God had given them a prescription that I am the Lord thy God that healeth all of thy diseases and if you fully obey my voice that all of the diseases that came upon the Egyptians shall not come upon you and you recognize that there was a God that was leading them to true worship he was leading them in the path that he'd already designed he had already set up a blueprint and Men He that God knew that men would criticize criticize his plan for taking them through the desert and taking them through here but God doesn't care what critics say about his plan he only cares about his church and he only cares about his word coming to fruition so I don't care what critics say about this message I don't care what ideas come up against us or what we're doing we are simply being led by the pillar of fire and I'm not going to argue with the one that made the plan I'm not going to argue with the one that is leading on leading us on the way I tell you this the children of Israel could go against everything there they that they come up against and they could go out there because Jehovah was leading them and that's why we can stand here as a bride of Jesus Christ with tenacity in our voice within a resilience in our heart and recognize that Jehovah is the same one and he's leading the Church of the Living God right into her destination I'll say this that the same one that led Moses is the same one that is leading me tonight that's leading us through these scriptures that's leading us through these healings that is leading us through these baptism that is leading us through the healings he's leading us through Miracles he's leading us through divine order and he'll be the same one that'll lead us right into a body change he ain't going to lead you off straight he ain't going to take you off course there's only one destination and the pillar of fire knows where you're going the purifier knows where to take you to he knows where to take in the scripture and give you courage he knows where to take you there and give you peace he knows where to take you and give you a strong a strong courage like never afford to believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever it wasn't Moses that was doing the leading it wasn't Moses that was given Miracles it was the angel of God what did it look like that that led Israel it was a pillar of Fire by night and it clouded by day and I believe that he should still the same one that is leading on tonight he's still the same Leading the People today as he was then and you recognize us as every one of us if you go through the sermon leadership that brother random would tell us that that from your very first step you had to have somebody that would lead you you had to have a strong hand that would help you up in your in your baby's steps and that same one that same one that led you that led you through through your toddler stage or through through this stage or that stage was the one that that led you as a parent he was your parent that was leading you he he was there the mother was there to lead you to lead you and show you things that were wrong as a child or how to how to not get in trouble or how not to fall in a hole or how to get there it was a man or a woman that was is leading you that was going to make sure that you got out of trouble he was somebody with a loving heart that kept there kept their protecting hand upon you as a child to make sure that if you if you got a fever in the night there was somebody that stayed up with you and and prayed with you that that cradled you that hugged you and and was there it was somebody that was watching out for you and to think that that as parents we we don't want to let our children sometimes get out of our quarter or get out of our sight because we want to be the one that protects them we want to be the one that we have sometimes parents that have a hard time letting go of their children but the same one that that got them here will be the same one that will protect them all the days of their life and I think it's amazing thing tonight to recognize that that the church the Bride of Jesus Christ is not under the leadership of a man that could fail her that could that could falter and get off the word but the church is under she is under the influence of the Almighty Angel we're not under the influence of a theologian we're not under the influence of a of an intellectual child but we are followers of Elohim I'm the omniscient one that knows our battles before we ever get in them he is El Shady high he is the god that is Almighty he is he is the all-powerful one and he knows he knows how much power it takes for you to get out and lay on us here I'll say this that this powerful one that is leading us the almighty is powerful enough to take you through laodicea and not lose you he's strong enough to take you through every one of your battles and your troubles won't overtake you he can take you through the fire and the Fire won't burn you he can take you to the floods and they won't overtake you you see he is the one that is leading Us in the battle and that's why he said take myself upon you put on the whole armor of God I'll say this that the one that is leading us into battle he ain't never lost one battle he's not one loss lost one case his record is complete and his record is perfect he's perfect in getting prodigals he's perfect in performing Miracles he's perfect in producing healing he's perfect [Applause] he's perfect he's perfect in giving an answer when no man can answer you he's perfect he's the one that's leading you it's been said that an army of sheep that's led by a lion will always defeat an army of lions led by a sheep so it matters who you're being led by and the church is being led by none other than the lion of the tribe of Judah I want you to know the only thing that scares a lion in the natural is another lion and I know that the Bible tells us that the devil's like a roaring lion seeking whom he made of our but the only one that can scare him is our great Jehovah and William Branham told us that you are kin to the lion of the tribe of Judah you have a sterness you have a firmness and you have a bravery and if he stood up as a lion of tribal Judah he is standing up and showing that I am your God I am I have enough bravery about myself when others won't stand up when others won't take the fence for you I am your defense I am your offense I am I am the god that heals you let me tell you the one that stood up for you is not a weak God it wasn't some wimpy line that ain't fed that ain't fed in nearly half a century he's been feeding he's been preparing and he knows what it takes to get you through I'll say this it did it pays to who your it matters who you're being led by it matters who you're being led by because the Bible tells us in Proverbs 28 and 8 28 and 1 that the wicked flee when no man pursue with him but the righteous are as bold as a lion it matters who you're being led by the one that we are being led by he ain't never ran for cover he's never hid and he's never went into Retreat the pillar of fire is still moving in the church he's not backing off of his promises he's not scared of cancer he's not scared of covet he's not scared of germs he's not scared of anxiety he's not scared of depression you can't scare the line of the tribe of Judah off of his promises and if we're kin to the line of tribe of Judah you'll not scare me off of God's promises [Applause] if he promised me healing I'm gonna get healing if he promised me Deliverance I'm going to get Deliverance if he promised me a holy ghost I'm going to get the Holy Ghost foreign Moses could take them right up to the ridge see no wonder Moses could put them right in the face of pharaoh because Jehovah was the one leading we know that the angel that led Moses was the angel of the Covenant which was Christ the son of God or the logos that came out of God which was the son of God and God delivered the children of Israel when they were in bondage and couldn't help themselves he said today God's people are not in bondage I want you to listen to gay God's people today God's people are not in bonded spiritually for they're delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit and if you're sitting here and you recognize you're a child of God and the enemy is telling you that you're still in bondage I have just read to you that your God has already set you free and you are not in bondage it's simply somebody that knows that the key has been took out of the door that is trying to make you think that you can't walk out of the prison house but the same Pillar of Fire that led Peter out of the prison house that led Paul out of the prison house he knows how to create an earthquake in this place to let you recognize that their doors already open and all you've got to do is walk out of the door of cancer walk out of the snare of the Fowler walk out of it because there's an angel that is encamped about the church today God's people are not in bondage spiritually for they are delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit and no man has to stay in bondage of sin any longer because the Holy Spirit brings him from the bondage of sin here was this one in the very beginning brother random said let's go back a million a million years and he said let's just take you out over the banister of time and he said allow you to look through the lattice and see this great light but in the beginning God was there in the beginning there was darkness that covered the Deep but in the beginning God said let there be he said now we watch as a logos of God goes out it goes out from the bosom of the father he said it is the word of God he he said it is our Lord Jesus Christ he said it's like a little child playing before the door he said that logos went out he said that is our Lord Jesus Christ he said now God is not a former in a body form he said because God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth he said so when out God God went out out of God went a little Mystic light a little Halo that was back there in the very beginning he said it was God up there he said now who is that same one that is in the midst today he said it's none other than that same light that was back there he said when God began to speak he said let there be light he said and then nothing happened he said and all of a sudden and Adam rolled over because the one that had the authority to speak to the darkness wrote an atom over he wrote an atom over and it come into creation because the one that was there in the beginning held the authority to be able to speak to the darkness I'll say this there is a man that is can turn on the light right here and it may not look like anything's happening for you and you watch let him speak he's still got the same Authority he's still got the same power he's still got the same anointing and he could speak let there be light over darkness and you watch you watch what he did back there he created a world and out when a son and he created the Earth and the Earth was without form and it was void and brother banham said he said that Earth was dripping wet with all the water he said so he sent the son to go around that Earth to dry off all of the excess water that shouldn't be there I'll tell you as a church let me let me let the preacher out just for a minute that same sun is circling your Earth he's drying off the excess problems and saying you're not going to have to deal with this much longer I am letting the son Circle you and tell you that you're mine you were in me before the world was formed before I created the sun you were there before I created molecules you were there before there was an atom that rolled over and created light you was already there little bride and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world God let meteors let Stars little clinkers roll off of his fingertips and let them roll for a half a million years and he'd stop them right there where they were what is he doing he's writing his first Bible in the heavens brother random said that God was writing his first Bible in the heavens so that man could look up and see that's where Jehovah lived at foreign you may not be able to see it tonight because of the clouds and things of the storm rolling through but they're still there they're still there whether you see the sun shining or not he's still there whether you feel his anointing he's still there whether you feel his healing power he's still there the god that wrote the Bible has never backed off one of his promises he's never backed off one thing and he's controlling your Earth yeah and he said let us make man in our image what did he do he said he said he needed somebody to lead the animal life he said that was man not to the trinitarian to think well God's having a conversation with somebody here let us make man in our image let's settle the debate when God created man how many did he create let us make man in our image God is one so man out of man came one and to think that God allowed this man over in Genesis chapter 2 and 7 that he created man Out of the Dust of the earth and he breathed into him the very Breath of Life he breathed into him and he came out of the Dust to the Earth and he began to lead these animals and he began to name those animals and you watch the faith of Adam at work that what the father had asked him to do here Adam is working as the father is leading him name the tiger Shiva name the lion this way name the dove this wave name the horse this way because of his power and because of his nature watch his faith in action and now God said or he said now he said let's watch what God is doing he's using man to lead nature Hey sir but now the Church of the Living God is to be led by the Holy Spirit now watch as man in the first Adam as he's there and he's controlling nature because he'd watch the one back there in the beginning and with the authority of the word speak to creation and it come to fruition exactly like he spoke it now the first Adam comes into existence and he begins to speak to creation and Creations got to listen to its master come into existence and there he is and he's making creation obey its Master brother random told us that faith is the master of every circumstance so every circumstance that you could come up against every problem that you can come up against you are taking the same Authority that Adam took back there in the beginning and controlling nature you by your faith Hallelujah are being led by a spirit to control the things in your life thank you we got Satan a little bit nervous tonight we're in a good spot then we're in a good spot so he tells us brother man tells us and who is God powerful message in 1950 he said he said who is God the one that stood there and rolled the Stars off of his hands and wrote the worlds out of his hand and made the things which do not appear deity deity himself lives in man the Creator that made heavens and earth lives in mankind he said why no wonder cripples when you realize that can straighten out the Creator's here no wonder blind and they can't see opens their eyes the creators here the Creator realize if you could just realize who we are that the Bible says that we are the sons and daughters of God we are his offspring and when God has heard Jesus is heaven he's having a conversation with Nicodemus when Nicodemus said I know that thou thou master or come from God can no man can do these Miracles unless God teach him I need Jesus speaks these words pretty profound except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God so a man that has never been birthed never had a born-again experience cannot understand what you're talking about tonight there's a lot of people that are sitting here or maybe listen on the internet that'll sit here and they'll have a clue what's being said to them is because they've never been birthed under this message but you watch when somebody grabs a hold of it gets a new birth and you watch them as God places them in the Kingdom as a fully adopted son and daughter of God you are always his son you never did becomes you didn't become some because you see the seed was already in you and because you were see you could be reporting the reason why you understand what I'm giving out tonight is because you've already been here you've already said here that Gene seal of God already knows what I'm preaching to you is the absolute truth [Applause] we recognize that God built us foreign with Body Spirit and soul but he gave us five contacts to contact this Natural Earth the ability to see is an amazing thing the ability to smell is an amazing thing if you had covet you recognize how precious that smell was hadn't that taste don't act like you didn't get it it can't be allergies all the time but anybody if you have you ever tried telling somebody have you dealt with a blind person that doesn't see I was with I was out of place and there was a father that was blind and it was he was standing at a place where a parade was going by and his daughter was out in front of him and he couldn't see but as his father the Man's father was standing there and he was describing everything that was going on and he just turned around and said is my daughter having a good time he couldn't see what was going on so to understand the power of sense to be able to contact is an amazing thing and brother random told us that God gave us these five senses to contact our Earthly home he said if you'd ever watch a man that would that would go and he would say I simply refuse to say that the sun shines and he would close his eyes he'd close his eyes and go live in the basement the rest of his life and say the sun doesn't exist you'd say there's something wrong with that man but somebody that really is blind they long they long to see that the woman I believe it Helen Keller is that the right name when she when she walked into Israel and she went into the Tomb of Jesus she went in there and somebody led her there her lady that would lead her into these places there was a man that was a was an author of Great books and he happened to be there at the same time that Helen Keller walked into the Tomb of Jesus completely blind and she walked out of the Tomb of Jesus and said I can find no darkness in here at all if a blind woman could walk into the Tomb of Jesus what about the Church of the Living God that walks in where the resurrection's at you are aware of the lightest hat you are where the message is half you're not in blindness no wonder John said you are not the children of Darkness but you are the children of the lights [Applause] I can find no darkness in this message I can find no darkness in this truth there's simply light all around us you've got a contact on the inside of your spirit and it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're recognizing this is the anointing this is the truth [Applause] and people that say it ain't true it's because they've never believed in it and they can't contact it so why would you let somebody that's walked in blindness of this truth all of your life why would you let them sit there and tell you it ain't right when you've already come in acquaintance with the one that is the truth I've contacted the one that set my soul free I don't understand a whole lot about electricity I just know you don't want to touch it with a screwdriver but if one of them wires got knit it's Pro there's a ground that's off somewhere it's a ground that's off somewhere there's something that's that's knocked it off and brother I heard I heard brother man I'm saying on the way to church um God's provided place of worship he saw what the problem is his people have grounded Jesus Christ from getting off I'm not going to sit back and ground Jesus Christ from Lifting me up I'm not going to ground this airplane I'm not going to ground what God's got set for this I'm not going to ground anybody foreign but I ain't gonna go there right now I'm not going to ground any of my children right here I'm going to tell you if you want to be re-baptized tomorrow you get re-baptized if you want a fresh anointing you get your fresh anointing there's not one Minister that's here tonight that's going to ground you and gonna stick you in some corner [Applause] notice he said that if you've got the holy spirit in you then you're a candidate for association with the Unseen World and the supernatural with you you're a candidate for the Unseen if you've got the Holy Spirit In You I'll say that anything that you desire in Christ as long as it's in the word it'll come to it'll come to pass in your life if you can bring anything through the filter of God's word and brother Branham told us in the thinking man's filter the only thing that can pass through the word is the Holy Ghost the only thing that can pass through there is a holy ghost your ideas won't pass through there your carnality won't pass through there your troubles won't pass through there so why don't your troubles tell why don't you tell your troubles this is your stop to get off I'm going the rest the way through through the word and you got to get off you can't pass through the word troubles you can't pass through there little ideas and little complexes and little stigmas won't pass through the word why don't you let the Holy Ghost lead you right through the word he's here he ain't got a sticker of your problems the rest of your life the son of man is here the son of man is here to make sure you make it to get every promise that's yours you're right in the Third Exodus and brother Branham told us it he told us that the Third Exodus is when the son of man the purifier goes in there and gets the bride out of the church where'd you come from Brother Jill it was a Third Exodus showing who you are you should have never been here you should have never been here but because of purifier went by your way should have never been here brother Meadows but because her Pillar of Fire said you're not going to commit suicide cancer could have killed you a long time ago if it wanted to but the pillar of fire is here [Applause] Hallelujah Christopher so what world are you contacting what world are you contacting where's your spirit being led where's your heart being led we recognize at the pillar fire is the Angel of the Covenant and God's got angels sitting by his side waiting for them to carry out the message that's what an angel is he's to carry out a message he's an intermediate between man and God and you watch when Daniel was down there and he's down there in Babylon and he's praying he's praying and he's praying and he's praying for 21 days he's praying for 21 days he's praying but when the angel came to Daniel he said Daniel Thou Art beloved you can go read it and find out if I'm telling you the truth in Daniel chapter 10. he said Daniel Thou Art beloved he said I couldn't get to you because a prince of the power of Persia had withheld me for 21 days but then Michael stood up and you may have prayed and you may have felt like you're about giving up I'm telling you don't you give up on your prayers Michael is standing up the lamb stood up for you the mighty Angel stood up for you and you watched the words that have spoken today and you'll buy buy the angel Daniel I heard you the first time you cried and I the angel am come for thou art I am come for thy words when it doesn't look like I am coming I'm coming for thy words when it doesn't look like it's on the way I'm coming because of thy words when it doesn't look like man's gonna do man's gonna do its part I am come for thy words little brother I have come for thy words the angel is here the anointing is here the pillar of fire that'll take you in a body change is here I am come for thy words I want to commission you don't you give up don't you back off your prayer life don't you back up on asking don't give up you contacted a world because of the Holy Ghost you have an association with the Unseen and brother bear told us and how can I overcome he said there's a major difference between the pillar of salt and the pillar of Fire he said it depends on which way you turn which way are you turning tonight have you turned your eyes towards on them have you turned your eyes back there to your loved ones thinking oh my and you're hearing their cries it matters where your eyes are I have chosen the path of the pillar of Fire now the Bible tells us in Exodus 23 and 20. that behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee in the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice and provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary under thine adversaries and brother random said now let's take a look at what this Angel looked like in Exodus 23 and 20 that I'll send an angel before you he said roll over to Exodus 13 and 21 and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud and to lead them in the way and by night in purifier to give them light to go by the night that's what the angel looks like the one that is leading you through the word that is your god is the pillar of fire he is the Angel of the Covenant and when the angel of the Covenant begin to pull the children of Israel out of Egypt they were no longer called the people of God they were the people of God until they were called out of Egypt and then they became the Church of God and the same angel that was leading the church then is the same Angel that's leading the church now foreign Moses is up there and he's having a conversation with a bush a pill or fire was exactly what Moses was lacking and Moses had that fire and the fire was in Moses and the fire performed the signs because the pillar of fire left the bush come on Moses that's your prophet and the absolute the pillar of fire left the bush and come on Moses but notice the pillar of fire couldn't live in Moses he could come and anoint his flesh and he could go because there was no perfect Lamb slain for him yet the anoint him would come and go on David the anointed would come and go on Isaiah the anointer would come and go on Ezekiel because there was no perfect Bloodshed yet but when the Redeemer Christ came that Blood Washed what Moses couldn't have the pillar of fire he couldn't have it living on the inside of his soul but he loaned for the day that you're living in as he could not he couldn't take away his ride he couldn't take away his temper it couldn't take away his lust because there was no perfect Redeemer yet but when Christ the perfect lamb stood up for you it takes away your lust it takes away your temper it takes away your pride and he leads you by the power of the Holy Ghost it's the glory of the Lord that's the one that set the atmosphere that's the one that's come week in after weekend he watches he begins to move over a congregation like this most of you would have never acted the way that you act or would have never got out of your comfort zone if it wasn't for the glory of the Lord that's come over you you hear it on tape nice brother random said no no how do you watch you watch the face of this woman just she sees as she's nearing as the pillar fire is nearing her what is it the glory of the Lord is coming over her and it's changing her countenance it's amazing thing when you when you're standing there and you've got a revelation from the Lord and somebody's asking a question about the Bible and they have no clue what it is but they've come with a sincere heart and they're asking now what does baptism mean or what is the Holy Ghost what is exactly it is and you begin to take them through the scriptures and Revelation strikes their heart you watch the countenance that comes upon that person and makes them a solid believer it's the glory of the Lord It's not the teaching of man that's doing it it's the glory that is revealing himself to the people and you watch when the spirit of God begins to move out there and cast The Spirit of the devil out you watch your countenance come over that person it's because that demon recognizes he's getting ready to be exposed he said now Satan hates Revelation but you and I love revelation it's the reason why you're standing here bold as a lion you've got a revelation that God cannot leave you here let me tell you as an astronaut you know where you're going you know you're getting ready to break past the sound barrier you're getting ready to leave this Dimension and as the Bride of Jesus Christ you are in an astronaut age and you've got rapturing fuel on the inside of your soul and you can't stay here I only got one destination and the one that is controlling me that is controlling the tube it's not me he knows where to push the button and he knows the time all I got to do is get in foreign I ain't been able to find my seat for the past for the past month I've had to set somewhere else every single time I come in here and you think you just simply found your spot I know how Humanity works but let me quote a prophet there was an angel that was standing by the aisle that led you to your pew let me roll you over into the spiritual just now don't get trouble when you can't find her see the Angels got your seat already picked out come on somebody come on somebody there's an Angel that's already went before you and he's prepared away for you all I can say is I want to find my seed and I want to get ready I'll tell you Church of the Living God don't even buckle up it's a time to set set out and get ready get ready don't you put your brakes on this service don't you put your brakes on this anointing just let loose just hunting loose there's an anointing here the Angels LED you by the way Satan can't even bind these services without somebody letting him control them but we are not led by the devil we have been led by the Holy Ghost so we say God have your Liberty lead us through the word lead us to our promise lead us to our body change [Applause] laughs we're gonna have to create a part to is that all right Hallelujah Hallelujah how'd you get where you are foreign what led you to love a little girl like you love what made the match the story it's a perfect love story that no author can write but the one that holds a pin is here and there's not one man going to put a period behind your life

man loves chewing I have loved you when others gave up on you but your story is not over I hold the pen in my hand there's nobody gonna put a period on it until I take you through the Rapture and then I put the end [Applause] Hallelujah the author of the word is here and Satan wants to close a chapter out on your life and a hand comes over and says no sir no sir them other people you can put your hand on them but you can't put your hand on my body you can't put your hand on my wife you can't put your hand on mine on it and curse it be the man that touches God's anointed you recognize Who You Are God's anointed it's a dangerous thing when a man touches a man of God but you as the body of Jesus Christ are his Messiahs and curse should be the man that touches God's anointed curse it be Satan and the day he touched your life curse it be the day covet came by your way cursed me the day the depression came by your way curse it be the day that said and it wouldn't come by your way God ain't put a period to the end of your story yet it ain't over till God says it's over he's going to lead you all the way to Revelations 22 and the spirit and the bride say come the spirit and the bride are
