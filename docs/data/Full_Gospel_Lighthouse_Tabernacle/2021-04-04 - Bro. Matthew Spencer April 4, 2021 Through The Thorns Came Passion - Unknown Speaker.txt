welcome the ones from brother ray erickson's church glad to have you here this morning thank you for making your way here brother ron and them they send their greetings certainly miss miss being here to see all theirs but i think they've had a wonderful time in the lord there in louisiana amen from what i'm hearing there's tremendous testimonies coming out of the services there we're going to hear even greater things amen let's just let's just go to the word this morning isaiah 53 and verse 1. and it says who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant as a root out of dry ground he hath no foreign form nor commonness and we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities and the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen are you glad of that this morning with his stripes we are healed and it says in verse 6 and all we like sheep have gone astray and we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgressions of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and in the pleasure of the lord shall he prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteousness righteous servant be justified many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore i will divide a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors amen god bless you this morning you can be seated we know here in this scripture and in isaiah that that isaiah was reading these things and had a vision to be able to see things from the foundation of the earth you know it was it was asked what does easter mean to you i'd like to ask you that this morning what does easter mean to you is it is it just just to show off a new clothes or new hat or maybe it's to do easter eggs and you know we enjoy all these things and and i feel that we should wear the best for the lord so so we do these things you know so here a little bit we might have a meal prepared for us maybe ham and stuff but it that's not easter for us amen easter is more than than those things and you know you might be thinking of what you might be making and hopefully it's not overcooking in the crock pots or whatever it might be and you know a man asked his wife one time as she cut a ham in half and put it in the oven said no now why do you cut the ham in half and put it in the oven like that she said well that's the way my mother did it he said well why'd your mother do it that way well i don't know so she called up her mother said why did you cut your ham in half and put it in the oven she said well i that's where my mother did it so she called her mother said now now why did you cut your ham in half and put it in the oven like you did because we don't know why she said well i don't know about y'all's ovens but mine wasn't big enough for the whole ham amen so hopefully we haven't come tonight just because our mother come to have church and that's the way her mother come to have church but we want to come to church to serve him this morning amen god's so good to us isn't he and it says in matthew 27 and verse 27 says then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers took a whole band of soldiers for one man and they stripped him and they put a scarlet robe on and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and they took a reed and smote him on the head and after they had mocked him they took the robot from him and they put on his own raiment and they let him away to be crucified this morning i would like to title my sermon through the thorns came passion as they planted the crown of thorns on his head i just cannot even imagine imagine what what that would have felt like as those thorns would protrude into the maybe the temples and and as it would be said they would cause stroke after stroke after stroke but still as isaiah said it he opened not his mouth he did all that this morning for us this morning i would like to take a little illustration and we know that the bible is not a fairy tale this is not no made up story but i would like to take a little bit of a fairy tale this morning as an illustration through the sleeping beauty you might think well that's odd just don't finish my sermon before i finish it here this morning so we we know sleeping beauty is as she was grown up that that it was told that she would prick her finger on a spindle well as it was said that she would be taken away into the forest and be watched over by the fairy godmothers well one day prince philip came riding through the woods and seen seeing aurora as she was singing and maybe she was just singing to the birds and the trees and he said wow what a beautiful voice what a beautiful young lady i'd like to have that as my bride one day so it would be that this this evil witch that had created this spindle and the curse that would fall upon sleeping beauty it would bestow her that on her birthday that this would come to pass well the king made ready and and as aurora came back into the castle they had tried to destroy all these spindles but the witch created one and she pricked her finger on the spindle fell asleep now prince philip he had heard that now this was his bride-to-be destined from way back so he took this this sword and his shield and he fought towards where the where aurora would be and the the evil witch he would create thorns and thistles trying to block him from getting to this bride and she would turn herself into a dragon and she would try to breathe fire down up on him but he would block it with the shield then he took this sword this sword that was made just for this dragon and he would fling it right into the dragon's heart the dragon would die fall to its death and there prince philip would make his way past a lot of the castle that was sleeping past the king and queen the other servants and whatsoever but would find a bride his bride and he would lay a kiss on her and she would awake happy ever after was aurora and prince philip but this morning i don't want to tell you a fairy tale i want to tell you a true tale of what god did for you and i along the same lines jesus pressed through the crowd pressed through the thorns making his way to calvary pushing on that was god's plan of protection for us in genesis it says he said i will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and the conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thou shalt be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto adam he said because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife thou hast eaten of the tree of which i commandeth thee saying thou shalt not eat thereof cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat all the days of thy life thorns and also thistle shall it bring forth to thee and thou shall eat of the herb of the field and in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat the bread till thou return unto the ground for out of wish thou was taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return and adam called unto his wife named eve because she was the mother of all living and un and unto adam also to his wife did the lord make two make coats of skin and clothe them through this god said i'm gonna make a way for you as they was walking out of the garden of eden those lambskins bleeding upon their legs that lamb that was slain for us as god wrapped them he made that covenant i'll make a way for you you won't always be like this as prince philip came in with a kiss to wake sleeping beauty so has our god our god has came in with a kiss as an eagle would feed mouth to mouth so does the word of the lord go feeding mouth to mouth power of the spoken word in john 1 it says in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was with god and the same was in the beginning with god that all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in the beginning that word has never changed before paul and luke and john and all them wrote wrote it in the bibles it was in existence before then god's never had a new thought never changed his word but it came to us to call us out and it says heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away as edward moat would write this in the 1800s says my hope is built on nothing less than jesus christ and righteousness i dare not trust the sweetest frame but holy lean on jesus name on christ the solid rock i stand all other ground is sinking sand all other ground is sinking stand you can stand upon the word of god he's our rock he's our refuge in time of trouble jesus was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory as the glory of god the only begotten son of the father full of grace and truth in hebrews 4 says it like this the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two is it sword piercing even dividing the sunderer of the soul the spirit and the joints and the marrow and is the discerner and thoughts intents of the heart that word of the lord as brother branham would say it it goes deeper than the flesh it goes deeper than the meat deeper than the morrow of the bone but it goes into a place a soul discerner of the false intents of the heart that is what the word does for us that's what he's done for us in this last day as an eagle would i'm pulling for brother branham's as an eagle stir for his nests if you'd like to go back and listen to that but as an eagle would stand up on her nest and she began to walk back and forth and she would call what was she doing she was letting her eaglets hear her voice why why would she do such a thing like this it's because when she takes them and through the perils of the storms and times of struggles they know her voice aren't you glad you know his voice this morning that voice that has called out come out of her my people amen that power of that spoken word let me just tell you a true story not a fairy tale of a damsel that's been arisen jerry is his daughter jerry is in the synagogues and we know that he come to jesus and said his daughter was sleeping and stricken a sickness had come upon her so jesus made his way to where jerius's house was and there was many that was round about and they would they was crying and making such a do he said why weepest thou would do for the damsel was not dead but she only sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn a lot of them a lot of them didn't think he could do it but he would take the father and the mother and go in and grab the damsel by the hand and he would call telithikumi which being interpreted as damsel arrives and she arose straightway talithikumi arise arise that word of the lord went deeper than the morrow went deeper within the bone into the heart into the soul and called out and said arise and the life was brought back there's another one that was spoken lazarus as martha came and said lazarus has gone lazarus have died if thou wouldst have been here lazarus would not have died lazarus would not have died and he she said to him jesus but i know whatsoever thou asked the father thou shall do it and he said he shall not die but he shall live again and she said i know that he'll live again in that last day of the resurrection but jesus said i am the resurrection i am the life thou believeth on me thou shalt live for thou art dead thou shall live again and he went to where lazarus laid and then the tomb and and he wept and the jews seen him and seen he cared for this man he loved this man and he said take away the stone take it away and martha said surely lord he stinketh by now four days in the grave he stinketh he spoke the word lazarus come forth lazarus come forth it says that if he'd call just come forth everything unto the son would have come to life at that moment but he called lazarus by his name have you heard your name this morning lazarus come forth awaken awaken to lethikumi awaken this morning come forth dams will arise let that word of god just seek right in this morning let that kiss of the lord just come in mouth to mouth and let it quicken your soul this morning arise lazarus come forth and he came forth but even greater jesus said destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it again in three days i'll raise it again talking about the quickening power of the lord god and i like this quote that brother branham gives here says down into the regions of demons on down into the very gates of hell he knocks at the door of hell and when he did devil come and i could just hear him say oh i finally got you i finally got you see i thought i had you with abel you see that seed was promised in the garden of eden and the devil has constantly trying to destroy that seed the death of abel and the coming of seth was just the death burial and the resurrection of christ that seed must continue and he tried to destroy it he said i thought i had you when i destroyed abel i thought i had you when i destroyed the prophets i was positive i had you when i beheaded john but now after all i've got you i've got you now and i can hear him say satan come here and he takes the keys of death hell and the grave off of satan's side and he puts it on his own side what does he do next he gives satan a good healthy kick stay in there satan cause the boss has showed up i'm the boss now i've got the keys of death hell and the grave amen my blood is still wet on that cross and the debt is fully paid you have no rights no more you're stripped give me those keys aren't you glad of that this morning that he took those keys deaf hell on the grave here he goes and he goes down through there and abraham and sarah hear a knock on the door who is that sarah i say who is that abraham go to the door if it's satan don't let him in but i can just hear him say oh sarah come here come here sir it's the one that i met underneath the oak tree that day i knew he'd live again and i could see daniel look over his shoulder he say that's the rock that was hewed out of the mountain just as certain as i'm standing here and i see job rise up he said that's my redeemer that i said i knew would live that someday that he would stand up on the earth i like this said my body might be but a handful of ashes but in 15 minutes 15 minutes i'll be in it again oh hallelujah ezekiel looks over the top it says i seen that person as a wheel in the middle of the wheel turning way up in the middle of the air and i could see enoch said i saw him coming to with his ten thousands of saints to execute judgments and he looks over and he says brethren i am the one that you think i am i am the seed of the woman i am the son of david i am the son of god i am the virgin born one my blood has atoned it for you you had to wait here until the blood of sheeps and goats under that blood but my blood has atoned it for you and you're free you're free this morning oh hallelujah as he comes up with those saints walking around meeting his disciples saturday was a bad day for all of them they were saddened by everything they thought everything's over the miracles that we've seen maybe it's over the one that we believed in has been crucified but on sunday morning oh king i'll see you in the morning morning's coming and he came forth he came forth his blood has atoned it for us he has fulfilled it this easter morning we can rest assure in that as a mother eagle would would miss an egg due to a farmer pulling it and putting it in a chicken yard to raise it under a chicken brother brandon would tell this story and he'd say that old eagle would rise up underneath those chickens and he just knew something was wrong he just knew that the worms and just staying down here on the ground wasn't meant for him and the chickens would just wonder why why why why would you want to do something else other than this this is great but one day the eagle said i'm missing one she began to cry out that call that word that i was talking about while ago he realized what is i know that voice i know that sound i know that sound as she cried over top of him i know that sound and he had to jump up on the fence post and she said spread those wings you gotta come up a little higher than that you gotta come up a little higher than that fence post young man come on up she called again and he went soaring spread those wings little eagle spread them out you were made to sword rahab was in the safest place that she could be because she applied the token as those those spies told her said apply that scarlet cord over thy window apply that token we have to apply that token in our lives today you'll be in the safest place you've ever been this whole world might feel like thorns and thistles poking in at you but it's time to leave the nest it's time to get on out of this old past house she was chosen as brother brandon would say it like this and i know my redeemer live she was god's chosen for that purpose we are god's chosen people today who believed in the resurrection of the lord jesus and there is no bombs there is no hell and there is nothing that can destroy god's purpose we've got to go in the resurrection it's the promise that we have god's purpose we're fulfilling god's purpose this morning god's promise to us job said it i know my redeemer liveth though through all the skin bowls and his wife tell them just cursed god and die god spoke to him and said come here i want to show you something raised up the curtain maybe a little bread brother brandon would say and he saw easter morning for the first time and he said i know that my redeemer liveth i know that he liveth and he's come forth he's done that for us as he pressed through those thorns and we used that word of the lord to cut the devil christ hath redeemed us galatians 3 and 13 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is the one that hangeth on the tree it's the greatest love story this morning that god could give to us though it looked like the worst murder there was as he was being beaten all these soldiers was taking out any anger that they ever had to beat this man cat nine tails that would rip flesh from his body thorns pressed into his head mocked spit upon carried the cross but he did it for you and i he redeemed us christ redeemed us and he went down to the pit of hill and took that sting of death for my father's house are many mansions and we're going to go there one of these days he's prepared it for us i don't have it in my notes but it just comes to my mind the armor armorer son as he made a promise to that little girl that was washing dishes one day said one day i'm going to come back for you you be ready you be ready she was made fun of but she put her wedding ground on and stepped out as they continue to make fun of her but towards that hour they begin to hear the hoof prince of the horse the wagon coming and he would sweep her away never have to wash dishes anymore that was his bride that's what god's done for us today he's pressed forth you're his bride he put that kiss upon you to seal you we all know this scripture in john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he would give his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent his son to this world not could to condemn the world excuse me for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved we thank the lord for that us as men and women today couldn't go through what he went through he's made our body to not go through that but he took it all every stripe he took it all for us this morning i want to ask you this morning maybe you've been pricked by the world maybe you're still asleep to those that might think that this is a bad sermon or whatever it may be i don't care i'm talking to the ones right now that's been pricked of the world that's fallen asleep one day i got awoken i got awoken in my life i might have been a preacher's son i might have been to every sermon that there could have been i might have heard them all but i was asleep but one day that word that word on that inside called out to me called out to me talithakumi arise don't stay asleep in this whole world waking up i i adjure you this morning let the word of god just speak to your heart this morning let that word of god

bombs start dropping it's too late too late of an hour wake up this morning wake up let that let that kiss of god just wake you up this morning as god cried out on that cross the veil was rent and torn he showed that he wasn't behind there no more he's risen this morning he's risen this morning as it would say over in john as they would come to the sepulcher in the morning and they would look in and they would see the grave clothes piled to the side but there was a napkin that had covered his face and it was folded now it's told in the hebrews tradition that a master and the servant had the relationship to know when he's finished when he's not and the master if he would finish eating take the napkin and wipe his beard wipe the food away and wad it up and throw it on the table it means i'm finished and just as this napkin was folded and laid at the foot at the head of the sepulcher it means not finished i'm coming back i'm coming back he's not finished this morning there's prodigals that still have to come home there's prodigals that we're still claiming this morning that we're crying out wake up wake up five wise five foolish virgins five took old five did not and he called out to the wise awakened and the bridegroom cometh oh put oil in your vessels this morning arise this morning let the word of god waken you this morning god god's not finished he's coming back for us he's coming back he's going to return and we're going to go in a meeting in the mirror let's stand this morning aren't you glad of what god's done for you this morning he's an awesome god to us
