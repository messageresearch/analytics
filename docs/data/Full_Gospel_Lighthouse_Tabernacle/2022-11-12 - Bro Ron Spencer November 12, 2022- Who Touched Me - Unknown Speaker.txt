going to be the deal you know that's the whole deal amen and so just thankful For What the Lord Has Done had an awesome meeting last weekend and brother Jason and brother Danny brother Jason called me today and he and he just shared a testimony of that sister Joey had a condition it was a condition in a feminine form and doctors had done all that they could do it was just nothing more that they could do and you know there's one of those spots to where you can't go through it can't can't go around it you just you just are there and on Saturday night some things were said and then on Sunday morning just a confirmation some things and you know sometimes a miracle happens and you don't really realize it's happened until you've already been through it and now you know it's happened so and so he called me today and said her Miracle took place and and we're just thankful for that amen amen I don't know if I'll remember it tomorrow but sister Catherine came up brother Brandon's wife came up with the umbilical cord had a had a situation with it with the baby and there was a lot of concern it was very dire concern and so anyway they had an appointment like the next day or two and uh well God knows how to take care of umbilical cords and so amen so we're just grateful for that I reminded her that sister Bethany the umbilical cord was wrapped in a certain way to where the baby's legs wouldn't wouldn't grow and there were some other conditions was going brother Tim and myself prayed for that baby brother Tim had had a dream that that baby was was well and had was everything was just right with that baby the doctors were saying all different kinds of things and so they were saying that uh wouldn't be born right and that baby born that little girl is born a tomboy and so amen so God's a miracle working you know he's still God amen and so we love him today amen maybe you have a need tonight to just literally say Lord would you remember me and pass by my way I believe you can heal me I believe you can heal me sister Deborah we've been praying for you [Music] been in your daddy's meetings many times and watch those big old hands [Music] and watch him preach put a handkerchief over my head saw a lot of things take place there in that life he sure Got Tonight he's a Healer a lord Jesus we don't come to touch a man tonight we come to touch you and we realize that we could we can only get past our senses and get into that sixth sense of faith it'll move mountains and we'll speak to things that seem impossible but God you're more than a miracle worker we ask you now that you'd send your word to all the ones that are sick and have great needs Lord I ask you that you administered to them tonight May the healing Angel go by their way Lord we thank you for the things that you have done but we still need to preach that you're a Healer you're a Waymaker I asked you tonight that you would anoint our lips as we'd stand in this Pulpit one more time Lord strengthen us Lord tonight for the journey [Music] with me in your scriptures tonight to Luke chapter 8 and verse 43. amen amen we certainly love you Luke chapter 8 and verse 43 and then we'll go to Luke chapter 7 and verse 39. I want to speak to to you tonight on who touched me I think it's kind of a fitting sermon for where we're at but it was lined up in the in the lineup and so here we are and you know I believe we can touch him tonight amen and a woman having an issue of blood 12 years think about the things that she had spent which spent all her living upon Physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of His Garment and immediately her issue of blood staunched and Jesus said who touched me when all denied Peter and they that were with him said Master the multitude thrown thee and press thee and sayest thou who touch me and Jesus said somebody hath touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good courage thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace there wasn't a rabbi in all of Jerusalem that could have done that so we make that declaration Luke chapter 7 and verse 39. now when the Pharisees which had been bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of a woman that it is that touched him for she is a sinner and Jesus sawing Jesus answering said unto him Simon I have somewhat to say unto thee and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors one owed 500 Pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which will love him the most and Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said to and said unto Simon seeest thou this woman I entered into thine house and thou gave us me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time that I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head and my all thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much for to whom little is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven I like that don't you amen you can be seated so many times we want to come to church and we have expectations if we could just think about it if there was a throng of people that was around Jesus it heard of Miracles they'd seen signs in Wonder take place but if they could only get into a space with him if they could just get him to look their way just for a moment maybe their needs would get met no doubt on this day that the woman is pressing her way you remember this is the same Journey that Jarius is going to be on and his daughter is dead before they can get to the house but Jesus would tell him fear not but remember it is on this journey to this house it's a walk and there's a throng to people around them and they're pressing their way and and no doubt many touch Jesus but they didn't get healed but she came in an atmosphere she came in an atmosphere if I could only Touch the Hem of His Garment I don't need him to pray for me I don't need him to speak to me but if I can only get him to Touch the Hem of His garments and notice the desperation this was the end of end all the ends if she don't get healed in this this particular meeting she's not going to make it I think of how many times that brother Branham would go and he would he would come to the pulpit late and he would apologize coming to the pulpit late and he said but I've been outside I've been outside praying and in the ambulances and and step up in the ambulances and people would travel from great distances and they would they would literally die on their way many are would die on their way to the to the tent meetings but they knew if they could only get there these doctors are that you know we all believe in doctors but but you know they they they came to the end of their resources you know they're now Reckoning you to another hospital into another Doctrine to another doctor because they're Limited in their factions and they're Limited in their knowledge are you with me are you with me and so and so anyway this this as they would come and brother Branham would step up in and and and they would step up in and many of those people were raised back to life you'll never hear of but they came of desperation if I die on the way if I die on the way and he would step up and pray for them brother Ronnie McCann shared he just passed away just a few weeks ago he's a precious man I knew him since I was a young boy and he said I went to the meetings he said we were we were young people me and my wife and we knew we couldn't get in but we would stand outside the meetings and hold hands and stand in that awesome presence and he said it was worth it just going and standing in that awesome presence he said and it changed my life forever it wasn't that he touched the speaker or he got to shake brother branham's hand but he but he got to feel the same God that the woman that touched the Hem of the Garment and from that point till the day he died he was a Believer it was a pillar in the churches that he was a part of I would like to say this to you our expectation should be the same yeah our expectations should be the same what will we get out of this service what will the service do for me I'll never forget and I just want to relay this in a personal way I remember preaching here maybe a year and a half ago and as I spoke and I talked to you about the ambulances and how that even in one's instance they traveled 17 hours in an ambulance to get there died on the way and then they were raised back to life and while I was preaching and that just kind of quickened and I felt the presence of the Lord hit me at that point I was so weak I could hardly speak I was so weak I could I was having a hard time I hadn't worked with the boy since the cancer diagnosis and I was having a difficult time with chemo and I went home that night and I was laying in the bed and about the middle of the night it struck me 17 hours away and I told the boys the next morning Tim Pruitt is 17 hours away I don't know what's going to happen I don't expect lightning but I'm going to have a step of Faith we're not going to tell doctors we're going to get in a car are you with me and it was it was Adam and Alden and Andrew drove me there took turns driving me there when we got there brother Tim was brother Tim was fishing on the on on the bank of the and he was just fishing and I walked down there and how did Dallas Cowboys hat on and we I walked down and I gave him a hug and and you know we just fell a ship for a little while that night we begin to have prayer I never felt lightning I never felt thunder I never felt no unction Adam received the Holy Ghost to a brother Tim Prince boys received the Holy Ghost I really never felt nothing but I acted on faith [Applause] when I came home I never missed another day of work [Applause] you tell me that's not God [Music] it's not that you're touching a man not that some special preacher preaches for speaks to you we can have confidence in men but the confidence is in the gift of Christ that's inside of the man as we would see it on display brother Brandon would turn his back to the audience to show us the same Melchizedek sign that was showed with Abraham and Sarah to where that revealed the secrets of the hearts brother Brady stood in this Pulpit on his last service he turned his back to the audience and he said there was 14 different he said I counted it 14 different cases that brother Branham called out with his back told them where they were sitting in the building called their names their address their condition had he been wrong in any little iota people would have never believed but it was more than a man [Applause] are you with me now we had a sign of the end that was displayed before us the mighty Angel was Among Us and God was displaying it Revelations 10. holding your life in his hand the book of redemption and he opened that book as the proof of his resurrection and now we get to handle the word of life now I want to say this to you when Eve and Adam fell because he fell first Adam fell with his eyes wide open as an act of redemption to reclaim her because listen God would have killed her she was commanded don't you touch that don't you touch that tree of Good and Evil are you with me but her touching the tree of Good and Evil caused her to not have access to the Tree of Life but God would have killed her but being a type of God himself he took Eve to himself and placed his seed on the inside of her and God commanded them to leave the garden and denied them access to be able to touch the tree of life again [Applause] oh how it must have been a testimony for that 900 years of what it was like to be in the Garden of Eden what it was like to walk in the pool of the evening and have fellowship with almighty God what it was like to move mountains Wellness light to speak to the animals and everything was perfect you could have fellowship with God you could touch God but sin took us across the chasm and we couldn't touch God yeah that's it yes it did he would fellowship with enough men all the way down to a man at the end of the stage of the journey the man named Enoch an Enoch would begin to write about what was written into heavens and he would write a pyramid on the Earth perfect and scientists of the world still can't figure out how you can build a pyramid so perfect because God was writing his Bible through a prophet Enoch that's a pyramid on the Earth and if you remember in in the heavens and in the pyramid he writes that there's enmity between the seed and he writes I will be your Redeemer no Prophet can do that Adam and Eve in their fallen condition couldn't touch the Tree of Life let me just say this to you when God came down to Moses on the mountain brother Shannon you remember what he told them said don't know no one put their hand on the mountain because God was such a holy God if a beast would put their their foot on the mountain it would die to walk unworthy into the holies of holy they would die they literally would put a rope on their on their foot and if they had a blemish in their life they pull them out because God's a holy God I was in a I was in a lawyer a famous lawyer's office for a friend of mine and and we were there to they had arrested a friend of mine and this is a long time ago and I had called them it was on a Sunday evening and and I called them I said will you take his case and say well this is what we we expect to get and I said well he can he can afford it and so anyway the wife was sitting sitting there with me before I would go in and talk to the to the man himself and she said you know she said I want my husband as my lawyer when I stand at the Throne of judgment and I looked at him and I said well that's one case he'll lose and I said there's only one lawyer that you want there you say brother on I'll stand there and everything to say they're only God will be doing the talking [Applause] uh so so if you can just imagine just for a moment you could imagine just for a moment that that we needed a redeemer and God condescended down through every prophet now in every prophet there was always a little bit of confusion you could see man but you could see God you could see Moses but there was times you could see God you could see Daniel but there was times you could see God you could see Elijah but there was times you could see God now brother Ron you're just way off Moses with a high temper Moses was a murderer are you with me he had us he had a sheet of wrongs even the scripture Bears out a high-tempered life imagine that on the backside of a desert even Joseph when it came down to a critical moment lied and he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ these men were displaying attributes of almighty God are you with me but like us today we can't heal you we can't give you revelation we can't save you but we can preach you into an atmosphere of one who can one who can heal you one who can save you one who can deliver you Hallelujah [Applause] there's a reason that we can do that is because we met him more than some intellectual gospel more than some computer thoughts put together are you more more than a Reformation we're not here to reform and we're not here to rehab we're here to transform are you with me foreign you call me Sister Barbara it's been several years ago now and Tabitha had been sick and was getting worse and worse and worse and worse and I was studying for a sermon and I think you guys were having cookie exchange if I'm right and she called me and so and when she called me she said Tabitha's right nigh unto death and they're just giving her hours to live and I I told her I said well I'll pray because that's you know that's what we can do that's the best thing we can do is I'll pray my computer was on my lap about my heads and prayed and a voice spoke and said go to her bed was an hour away I called her back and I said I'll go the Lord told me so I got myself together and I drove there for the most of you you know this story and I said I'll go it was getting now late and I I walked I walked down the hall I walked into the room there's a nurse there their daughters there her husband was sitting on the little we sat down we talked and they were checking her signs and they were different things and her husband and I I had conversation we talked for quite a while and he talked about insurance he talked about the job he talked about funeral plans he talked about a lot of things he talked about a half an hour I just let him talk because I felt like I really didn't know what was going to happen and I said well I'll just have to say this to you I don't think that God sent me here to talk to you about funeral plans I don't I don't think so this is just one time really brother Homer and I walked into a room of people we didn't even know their son had been Twisted in an accident and literally I'd never seen anybody twisted like that his body was contorted he was contorted in a lot of different directions we were instructed not to DARE lay a hand on him the parents couldn't touch him and the doctor stood and said don't touch it we prayed when that boy woke up the next morning his body was perfect and this is what he said two angels walked into the room last night Mom and Dad did y'all see them walk in and I felt the catch no man can do that no man can do that I could stand here for the rest of this evening and tell you Miracle after Miracle after Miracle brother Homer went in and prayed for brother Abby one time in the VA and there was a there was a man that was laying uh beside at the next bed and his sisters said we we will you pray for him too she said yeah I said the preacher's here and he's going to pray for you and you're going to get well and brother Homer ladies hands on and prayed for him he left he came back a couple weeks later and the man was gone brother Abby said well he said well did he die he said oh no said said the next day he got up he got out of the bed and left went home he's well I'll never forget she weighed about 85 pounds she was Green I'd never seen a person that green foreign I held her I just took her head and her eyes was rolled back and they told me quickly that she hadn't spoke for a while and I called her name and her eyes rolled right down to me and I said Tabitha and I'll tell you what I told her I'm going to be very honest with you I told her I said you haven't always agreed with me amen but I'm here I'm here for you and I want you to know Jesus is here for you and I told her exactly what had happened Sister Barbara made the call for you for me to come and I would pray for you at home and then God would speak to me to come and pray for you and I'm sitting here now and I don't believe that I'm just here for you to die yeah and I prayed listen we as Believers have power and authority with prayer we're not touching some Pope's chair we're not kissing some statue we're not rubbing some beads we're not rubbing across we gotta live in God that conquered death Helen the grave he went to hell so I wouldn't have to go to hell he raised up on the third day so that when I die he can raise me up no matter what condition that I would be in he took Stripes at College judgment Hall and did not call thousands of angels to set him free so we could be healed [Applause] I turned around to her husband and I I said she'll walk down the hall with you tomorrow correct not die in a couple of hours she'll walk down the hall with you tomorrow they called me and said she did the nurse told me said Mr Spencer do you do you realize the conditions she's in and you just said she would walk down the hall tomorrow she's going to die in a couple hours and here's my words to her I didn't say it [Applause] she actually became a nurse and took care of our brother Homer you're talking about a real full circle God's really neat in how he operates isn't he Jesus would say no man takes my life I lay it down I take it up again it wasn't up to caiaphasis it wasn't up to Pilate it wasn't up to soldiers listen let me just say this to you so many times you hear people say Abraham had to chase Isaac down so that he could put him on the sacrifice he was willing Jesus was willing to drink the bitter cop remember he he actually died at the Garden of Gethsemane father left this cup passed from me not my will but thy will be done notice some scriptures before I go too far Colossians chapter 1 and 19 for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross for him to reconcile all things to himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth are things in heaven now notice he's going to bring you into this and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your own minds by Wicked works yet now hath he reconciled God knew where he was at you looked unsavable you walked unsaveable you talked unsavable but God rich in Mercy you would be an aliens from the kingdom of God called you before the foundation of the world ever get a chance Joel's got a testimony he was just wondering something was thirsting in his life and he was just wondering just looking he said I wanted to live off of the grid something was pulling on the inside of him something got to pulling on the inside of you because you wasn't looking for God God came looking for you yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you you were filthy but watch what he did for you Anna to present you holy unblameable an unreprovable notice these next three words in his sight now the one that wouldn't let Adam and Eve back in the garden to touch him or let any animal or let any any man touch the touch the mountain or anybody walk into the holies of holies now you're holy unblameable unreprovable in his sight household by some school no by the blood of the Lamb [Music] Hebrews chapter 4 thank you I needed that Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 14 sin then that we have a great high priest foreign thank you that is passed into the heavens Jesus Christ the son of God let us hold fast our profession we have a great high priest for we have not noticed the word in here we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities too many high priests in in Israel it was just a job to them but we got a high priest [Music] whether you got money or you don't got money whether you're sick with a cold or you're dying with cancer we got a high priest that can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin I want you to just notice because I want to tie into two weeks ago here right now yeah without sin don't you know you have the same accuser of the Brethren that is fighting you and Jesus could stand there and he was tempted in all like manners and our thoughts sound louder in Heavens than our words do on Earth and Jesus were tempted in an all-like matter and the accuser even his own enemy said I find no fault in him because the priest would take those lambs and turtle doves and they would look for if of it wasn't blemish on them they couldn't use it and if he's our savior and there's a blemish in it we're lost we sing the song Worthy is the Lamb no man in heaven no man in earth you know if we're not careful we'll lift one another up this or this or this we have right we have rights of respects and gifts are different and men are different there's private soldiers and there's generals you know anybody don't understand that that's just they don't understand you know there's orchestras but there's lead orchestras but let me just say Jesus was more than just one of the boys he was more than just one of the prophets [Music] listen he was God if he wasn't God then he was the greatest impersonator that ever lived he was both man and God Romans chapter 3 and verse 21 am I going okay are you are you catching what I'm saying but now in righteousness of God without law is manifest being Witnesses by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all men and unto all them that believe for there is no difference notice these next words for all have sinned well brother Ron I never drank I never smoke I never did anything all have sinned the the guilt of all your forefathers came down to you all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through Redemption that is in Christ Jesus how long does it take to break the chain of sin on your life seconds the woman that washed his feet never went back to that lifestyle again the woman at the well never went back to that lifestyle again are you with me just testimony all over this building many of you were wrecks of society but God rich in Mercy in just a few seconds God transformed your life no man can do that Romans chapter 8. there is therefore now no condemnation to them that which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of Life of Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God's sinned in his own son in his likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemn sin in the flesh he conquered sin [Applause] thank you Lord First Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 9. know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor adulterers nor idolaters nor feminine nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves or Covetous nor drunkards or revitalers nor extorters shall inherit the kingdom of God Heaven's going to be a pretty good place hello I hope none of you had your money in Bitcoin this week I'll take my glasses off well I'm sure there's some people unhappy with that guy if you'd give all your money to that guy for a for Fantasy money you'd be mad when it's all gone but what was you thinking sing that song to yourself what was I thinking and Andrew ain't even here he just described what's not going to be in heaven but notice he don't quit writing there and search read that next let's just read it together and since were some of you but ye are washed but ye are Sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by a spirit of our God [Applause] there was a little boy that was constantly getting muddy and his mama would give him sermons don't get in that mud hole no more she thought she gave him a good sermon and he had promised his life I'll not do it I'll not get in it and she watched him as he walked out there beside that mud hole and he was throwing rocks and over in it you know and after a while he took his shoes off and and he took his shoes off and and he uh put his toe over in it and it wasn't long he was he was having a bath when he finally came back in she said you told me you wouldn't do it anymore he said the devil made me do it he said he got behind me and pushed me in my buddy told me that had a young man that was coming to church and all of a sudden he was missing for a weekend and so he asked him he said where would you asking last weekend he said well he said I've been doing really good at church he said I've been serving God real hard but he said last weekend I just had to go get myself drunk and my buddy had to explain to him that ain't how this works just because our credit card gets paid up and you don't sin no more don't give us a license Hallelujah so go back and recharge on the card but God's rich in Mercy to you well brother Ron but I fell get up again he said wherever one condemned no matter what we do we're condemned we were born condemned when you were born you were born condemned your mom and Poppy was born condemned you're all all your ancestors was born in sin in shape and iniquity how are you ever going to get it how are you going to be perfect if you ever done a thing never stole never lied never done anything in your life you're still condemned and you were judged of God before you breathed your first breath for you were judged by the sexual desire of your father and mother and through their act brought you on the earth and God condemned it in the beginning you're condemned to start with and every other person on the Earth what's condemned with you there is a perfection oh I love that don't you now I want you to just notice when that woman went and touched the Hem of His Garment she immediately knew she was well it was immediate sister Jeanetta brother Tim was here because of my father's funeral and you had came and you stood at the altar right there and you found a special part in brother Tim's heart now brother Tim couldn't save you but he found a certain a certain prayer for you and so every once in a while he'll ask how's she doing don't miss a service she's doing real good over Labor Day he he saw you shouting he said she's doing real good she's doing real good now brother Tim couldn't do that for you I couldn't do that for you I've been your friend since you were a girl when y'all were living in a trailer just across the hill and me and Connie were dating your mom and dad were throwing things at each other at that point in time but you see I couldn't save you and neither could Brenda when you would maybe sit on her porch and talk to her about things of life she walked in this building the same as that woman touched the Hem of its garment and you knew that you couldn't stay the way you wasn't don't you like it when God talks personally to you and you knew you couldn't stay the way that you were and if you can ever get in these presence one time how do you know that brother Ron you're a preacher I went to service with a 12-pack in my car with my grandma she wasn't on a drink with me but I was headed to a party after that service I walked to the Altar and looked across and she was at the altar and she could out curse most Marines my mother's mother my mother's mother I want to make that clear bless her little heart and there was times in her journey she still needed more of Jesus when I walked out of the building that night I I didn't have to go to any classes I drove across the street and it was a can now remember they used to have cans for trash and I took that and I put it in that can I threw it away and I said I'll not need that no more and I never turned back [Applause] I want to tell you one more and then I'm going to close because I seem to be a little low and so we had been married three years and brother Homer had bought his home place and whenever I came down for a few days off we'd work and brother Homer had me painting the chimney and is up on the ladder painting a chimney and Homer hollered at me and he said why don't you come down here Ronald he always called me Ronald he said come down here I said okay he said why don't you come now and Homer wasn't one to cry but he was crying and I said yeah what's up you know for those that didn't meet him he was tougher nails he was tough for nails I got bit by a copperhead one time he was about 300 yards away and I walked up to him and I told him I got bit by a copperhead and he he pulled out a bottle that was in his pocket and he gave me two benadryls put his hand on my head like that right there and said that the name of Jesus go be well go back and finish what you're doing hey it worked [Applause] he said three years ago I was wrong about you and he said I prayed God you you answered every prayer but you let my daughter marry you he's gonna I couldn't see what you would become I said I want you to forgive me we became best of buddies I probably drove him all over the United States and he still told me how to get there but you see sometimes we can't see one another and what they will be and what they are but when God places a seed on you you get that seed in the right atmosphere when that woman was inspired to leave her house two of them one was inspired to leave her a house that her physical being would be well the other one was inspired to take all that she had and go by ointment because she didn't want to live that way no more and they wouldn't make her well but she went to that service and if nobody else would worship him I wash his feet I'll cry because I want to repent I want to repent I don't want to be the same Hallelujah and I close tonight I'll finish tomorrow both of them went away never to be the same ever again and here's what I want to say to you tonight and what's been on my heart all week I don't want to only touch him one time I want to live in his presence I want my children my
