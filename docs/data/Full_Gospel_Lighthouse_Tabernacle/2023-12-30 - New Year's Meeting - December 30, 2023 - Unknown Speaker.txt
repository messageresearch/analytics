service and this whole weekend and it's always such a wonderful time of year and uh you know really enjoy these special services amen so we won't keep you standing for too long if you you'll just turn with me to Luke chapter 18 we'll get right into the scriptures here Luke chapter 18 we'll begin with the first verse aren't you so thankful to be serving a God that doesn't change this word that was pinned 2,000 years ago is just as real and just as alive and just as effective as the day it was written as a day it was spoken off the precious lips of our savior is still just as true amen let's begin reading verse one and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there was in a city a judge which feared not God neither regarded man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he shall avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth let's speak to him just now dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus any person father Lord any abled-bodied person Lord can turn the pages of this scripture but father God it takes your Holy Spirit Lord to get behind the words and to speak the words of eternal life to our souls Lord You've gathered us here together Lord not of our own selves father Lord or not for human or carnal reasonings but Lord for Divine Purpose we just pray oh God that you forgive us of all of our sins and mistakes Lord and as we look into your word may you just help me Father Lord to take the thought Lord that you've laid Upon My Heart Lord and help me to get out of the way that your spirit can get behind the voice father Lord of a feeble man Lord may you be the voice behind The Voice May it Quicken Faith to your people Lord we love you with all of our heart we commit this service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you as you're seated with the help of the Lord I'd like to speak on just for a few moments here I like to title it shall I find faith in verse eight again I like to read I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth scoffield if you have a scoffield Bible you'll find it there in the footnotes but he makes a very interesting and a profound statement on what this verse means here the word faith this isn't a lot of times when you hear do you have faith to be healed or I have faith that this will happen or you know I believe God's going to do this and that is faith and we know that faith will bring God's word and God's promise to pass in your life yet here what Jesus is speaking of is not exactly he's not asking the question when I come back to the Earth will I find the faith that people can believe me for healing or maybe they can believe me for something that they want me to do in their life the scofi mentions here the reference is not personal faith but to believe in the whole body of the revealed truth now that changes what Jesus is saying here he's asking the question that when the son of man comes back after 2,000 years of being the office of the Holy Spirit when I come back to earth to receive my bride when I come back to the Earth in as son of man again will I find faith on the earth will I find the faith of the son of man on the earth and we know that faith faith is a revelation real genuine faith is not hope real genuine faith is a revelation I heard the prophet say the other day he obviously was wearing a white shirt but he said if God can if you can believe God about something you're trusting in for as much as you're convinced I'll use my shirt as an example that I've got a green shirt on there's nothing to keep you from getting what you're asking God for if you can be so convinced about the God's word as you are that I am actually wearing a green shirt does anyone in this church doubt that I'm wearing a green shirt you're convinced so why can't we have the same convincing about the word of God the faith when I come back will I have that faith will I find that kind of faith in on the earth not just a faith for healing because the the nominal Christians have that they understand that God heals they understand that God Saves but will God find real genuine unadulterated faith in the word of the hour when he comes back with so many people falling away with so many people leaving the message will there be a people on the Earth that refuse to give up that have a faith not just for healing but an unshakable Faith the Revelation in his word that the message of the hour is just as effective now as it was the day it was spoken that's the kind of faith God is looking for that's the kind of faith that God brings God on the scene in Hebrews 11 the Bible tells us now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now watch this by Faith by Revelation Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which by his sacrifice he obtained witness that he was righteous and God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now there's a lot in that verse because Faith because Abel had the Revelation to know what to present to God that's right and that justified Abel and God actually testified that that was right whenever he came down and he consumed Abel's sacrifice but left Cain sitting there God Justified that I accept Abel but refused Cain's sacrifice and despite even though Cain killed Abel Abel's sacrifice still speaks how did his sacrifice still speak because of what he did spoke to what God had in his mind because see it's when our minds and our hearts it's when our minds and our thoughts and hearts and Revelation all align with God's mind that's when something's going to take place that's when you can have your haty right moment because of your desire and you align yourself with God's thought on a matter a negative testimony is not God's thought on the matter speaking the word in faith is God's thought on the matter repeating what God Said how did how did the prophet say that in the church age book when a born again Christian gets the word of mouth and gets the word of God and speaks it from their lips in faith it's the same as deity speaking why because when you speak his word it's not your word it's his word so you're then getting his word and you're putting it in your lips on your heart first it goes from the mind to the heart and out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so it goes from mind to heart out and when you speak in faith despite your circumstances you then align yourself to what God thinks on the matter because God's thought is already recorded on the word so then God says Amen to what you say because you're repeating the word of God that whenever we align ourselves as I said that is when mountains to move that is when blessings are poured out that is when deity is displayed because you align yourself with the mind of God and that is what Abel did he what God already had the lamb slain in his mind before the foundation of the world and When sin entered in and time entered in here Abel presents a sacrifice that is exactly what God was thinking so God came down it pleased God what did Jesus say he said for I do always those things that pleased him he was always walking in the will of the father he said the father shows me and I work hither to so whenever he walked and God showed him to leave Lazarus was going to die and he had to leave and you know the story and all the different footsteps of everything he did was with a purpose and everything he did aligned with the word that is why everything he said came to pass Abel displayed on Earth exactly what God had in his mind in heaven oh yeah that is real Faith he no doubt was taught by his parents because remember when Adam and Eve fell God came and they killed God had to kill an innocent lamb and clothe Adam and Eve and Adam began to teach teach his son this is we left the Garden of Eden this is why we had to leave and out of all of creation he chose a lamb he didn't choose to cover them in a in a Wolf clothing God didn't choose to cover them up in the clothing of a badger he chose a lamb why because the characteristic of a lamb is one of the most innocent things in creation and Adam begins to tell Abel these things and Abel is teachable unlike Cain that's right Abel begins to retain these things that Adam tells him and he then puts it into practice the prophet of God said Here Comes able knowing that it wasn't apples or fruits God didn't dwell in beauty or sincerity he dwells in election and calling so he wraps this Vine around the Lamb's neck and here he comes moving up to the altar I suppose his altar was a big rock and he takes this little fellow and throws them back on this rock like this takes a rock cuz I guess they didn't have any lances or knives in them days and there was Cain up there just a glorifying God in his Beauty Lord What I've Done Lord look here you know my heart you know I'm sincere I'm giving you all the praise I'm doing this I'm doing that all what he's doing and little old Abel Abel took that lamb threw it back like that got a rock in his hand and begin to chop its little throat I see Abel's hands become bloody I see the white wool hanging around that little lamb bloody God looked down and he said that's it you've got it Abel was prophesying that's right by his sacrifice God looked down and he seen himself right there it's no wonder he came down to consume the sacrifice it pleased him what does fruit have to do with Redemption what does Beauty have to do with Redemption hundreds of years later Isaiah comes and said there's no beauty that we should desire them right Beauty has nothing to do with it but it's the character the life that has the ability to redeem that has everything to do with it but God looked down and he said that's it you've got it what did it speak of the Lamb of God that was slain from the foundation of the world was led with a rope around his neck of gol goa's Hill Yonder Hallelujah they laid him down they beat his body into into stripes for the healing they nailed in his hands and he stuck there between the heavens and the Earth on the Rock of Ages crying out with an unknown tongue speaking Eli Eli that lamb was speaking in an unknown tongue to who the sacrificer it was sitting there before Abel and Abel didn't know what that L was doing it was blading out BL in out and the people that was killing this lamb the Jews that hung him to the cross the unbelievers didn't know what he was saying he was speaking out to the father Eli Eli that was Abel's Lamb slain from the foundation of the world his bloody locks hanging around him what was Calvary it was another can and Abel moment because after Abel sacrifice was accepted Abel no doubt began to expound to Cain because remember Adam and Eve sin God clothed them then Abel and Cain grew up together and became of age then this what what I what we're talking about here this event happened they both presented their sacrifices of worship then God tells Cain hey do do like your brother and you'll be accepted so there was a process of time and a begins to to to no doubt maybe preach God's chosen place of worship to Cain maybe he began to preach Jezebel religion to Cain and one day it made him so angry he maybe picked up a rock or a club laying on the ground and killed his brother the more able spoke the more angry king got because whenever you preach the word word word the the word is light and it scatters darkness and people's reaction to the word tells you where they're at so whenever the word just like if the word calls you an eagle it tells you who you are if it calls you a chicken it tells you who you are it's the same word so the word was calling Abel a Son of God but the word was the same word was calling Cain the son of the devil and as Abel be to preach can it be to really get him going and it made him so angry he killed him when Jesus was on the earth the greater Abel the greater Adam the greater Seth the more he spoke and the more he preached the more it angered the phes and the Sadducees he was they were already angry when he healed on the Sabbath but wait until the precious words of I and my father are one it brings such Clarity to us but it angered them they then begin to try and think how can we get rid of Jesus see the Pharisees and the Sadducees they maybe were direct descendants of Abraham right and maybe they could prove it and Jesus didn't even deny it but you find in St John 8:44 Jesus finally lays it down to who they really are he said ye are of your father the devil isn't that what Cain was and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him until when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and it angered them and it angered them and it angered them and they got to a spot with until the day they rose up and they killed Jesus that's what that's what I believe it was Steven there in Acts two ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain brother Ram continues there's God's provided sacrifice there's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints hanging bleeding blading dying like Abel's lamb that's the faith he wants to find on earth when he comes back the faith of the fathers earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's why God had to sent a prophet to restore back the faith to restore back the faith that Jesus is going to come looking for Abel's L was accepted in Mount Mariah Abraham's sacrifice was accepted on Mount Carmel El El's sacrifice was accepted Mount Calvary the perfect sacrifice was accepted and if you put yourself on the altar tonight not with Works Lord look what I've done you remember in the scripture Whenever there was a Pharisee that prayed Jesus tells the story and he said Lord I'm so glad and the FY I believe it was he was praying and he was saying Lord I'm so glad I'm not like other people I'm so glad I'm not like this Publican over here I'm so glad i' haven't done this I'm so glad I haven't done that I'm so glad I haven't done that and there was a sinner a Publican who was so broken he said he wouldn't even look up to heaven he was so ashamed of himself and he said God have mercy on me a sinner Jesus asked the question he said who left Justified the the religious Pharisee or the Publican that was broken God would have consumed his sacrifice so whenever we're broken and we empty out and say Lord there's nothing I've got that I can give give you but myself you lay yourself with that kind of attitude on the Altar and I promise you your sacrifice will be consumed with the fire of the Holy Ghost because full obedience to the word entitles you to what the token now God's faith is not a wishy-washy hop so Faith God's faith is an overcoming Faith now overcoming is not necessarily when we shout when we rejoice and enjoy Supernatural experiences those things are either in Victory or God is preparing you for something overcoming is when you're by yourself true overcoming is when you're by yourself true overcoming is when you maybe know or or you know where you're in a position where no one would ever know if I do this but yet you are a Christian in that moment that is where you overcome that is true overcoming but why are we why do we Rejoice at the word because it strengthens us for those moments why do we dance in the spirit why do we shout because it strengthens us we shout and we dance in Victory because there's people that dance and shout and speak in tongues and do everything in church but can't overcome worth a hoot out there so what's the difference you see but when you've got something in you to overcome with it's his faith that will overcome the world because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world praise be to God we have more than it takes to overcome now think of this in the scripture when John the Baptist when Jesus appeared at John the Baptist on the on the Jordan River I heard brother Bram do a beautiful dramatization the other day never heard it quite like this before but he said that Lazarus told Jesus about John the Baptist because they were childhood friends and he said he took him down and when John the Baptist seen Jesus he said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he said that Lazarus fainted at Jesus's feet here was his childhood friend and he's the Messiah but you see John the Baptist introduced the Messiah in front of multitudes of people no doubt but what look in the scripture he Vindicated him and he announced him to the world but when Jesus then led by the Holy Ghost went up into the mountain to be tempted for 40 days and 40 nights there were multitudes with him no he was by himself but he had what he needed to overcome the spirit of God descended on him like a dove he was God and flesh he healed multitudes and he preached in front of multitudes but when it came down to the Garden of Gethsemane where he had to die to himself he had to overcome himself he was alone that is where the character of Jesus Christ is made alone you and him we all share testimonies but we all have our own testimony we're all collectively baptized in the body of Christ but we get in there individually now overcoming a lot of times is just in the mundane everyday tasks you're just going to your job you're going to your you're going through your life you're going through things you're being a light to the world but you're overcoming each and every day overcoming is standing toe-to-toe with the devil and refusing to back up up refusing to back up that's the kind of Faith Jesus had and that's the kind of Faith Miss Jesus has overcoming is believing and loving God despite the circumstances and the lack of our answers we're humans we love having answers to things well God will get us a lot of times in a place where we simply don't have the answer but you got to believe them there sarapan woman in the scripture let's read that Matthew 15 and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the devil but he answered her not a word could you imagine Jesus standing here and you have a need like this and you going up to him and saying Jesus I I I I need you my child is sick or my husband or my wife is sick could you would you please come would you please heal him he don't even look at you and you're standing here and he's standing here this ain't the preacher this is God himself and you're asking him to do something for you that you really really need him to do but he won't even look at you in fact maybe he just turned this way but she refused to back up she was made of the stuff that wouldn't Bluff the Bible says and he answered her not a word and his disciples came and beside him saying send her away cuz she crith for us she kept going on and on and on and then not only did he ignore her but when he finally turned to her and decided to say something to her he said something like this yeah I am not sin but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel then she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me see how perseverant she was and then he further tells her this it's not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs he ignored her for a long time he nagged she nagged so much the disciples like please get this woman away from here he ignored her wouldn't talk to her and when he finally gave her a moment of his time he called her a dog Jesus called her a dog why because he knew what she was made of he wouldn't have just tested her if that would have sent her away because he knew she was elect and what did she say she didn't stomp at a church she said truth Lord come on she agreed with the word truth you're right I'm a dog I don't deserve you but if I could just have a crumb if you you know if you could just slip me some crumbs off of the table that'll be enough for me you're so mighty and you're so wonderful and you can just cast Satan with a flick of your finger but just give me some crumbs if I could get some crumbs off the master's table that's all I need but listen he hasn't called you for crumbs he's called you to the wedding supper he's called you to the wedding serer of the Lamb he's got your name written down he's got your reservation a table spread 1,000 miles long he hasn't called his bride to drums he's called you to a seven course Mill pull up and eat it's all for you he died to make this possible glory to God oh she wanted was crumbs oh Church what people ought we to [Applause] be he knows he looks down and no doubt the Holy Spirit right now if you only realized what a preferred lady you were you are you're preferred you're like Esther you've got a special place in his kingdom she refused to back up but he said one word to the disciples in St John chapter 6 except you eat the Flesh of the son of man drink his blood you've got no part with me me and they said this is a hard saying I can't I can't take this and they left and there's still a few more too many hanging around like with Gideon and he said what will you do if you see the son of man ascending from whence he came and in St John 6 chap in St John chapter 6 verse 66 666 the scripture tells us that from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then Jesus said unto the 12 will you also go away but do you see the difference in what was in Peter and what was in the other disciples he said Lord to whom shall we go that's right thou Hast the words of eternal life the same spiritual strain that was in the sarapan woman was in Peter they're from the same family nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth brother Bram said in the sermon be certain of God we're nearing the coming of the Lord God's coming for a church he never asked in question will I have a church will I have righteousness but here was the question Jesus asked will I find faith when I come God putting you to a test maybe to try your faith we're now looking at 2024 right in the face we're that much closer to the coming of the Lord the message is still thus sayith the Lord the bride is still marching forward in the perfect will of God we're dressed in his word and we're waiting for the boss's son to come get us we're dressed we're on the edge of the road and there's people laughing at you good people maybe but you know you've got a promise hanging over you and you're standing on the edge of the road with anticipation on your face and you're dressing that beautiful wedding gown and you can we're living so close we can hear the wheels coming we've been told he's coming back we see what's going on in Israel we see the world events that what is that that is the noise of the wheels coming to get you because before they can have their time and before the bombs can fall like they will fall you've got to get out of the way so that is the wheels coming down the more trouble we hear the more wars and rumors of wars and all these troubles of the world the more the louder and the closer the wheels get now's not the time to run back in the house now's not the time to say I hear the wills come but I've got enough time to go dip in the world I've got enough time to go do this you don't have time you stand in your spot and you wait because he's coming on he's on the way you don't want to miss it don't run back in the house don't don't worry about it you commit unto God you don't worry about it one man a g one day a man want and I'm closing one day a man wanted to follow Jesus and he said Lord let me first go back to my house and tell my family goodbye let me go do this that or the other and Jesus said he that puts his hand on the plow and looks back ain't worthy of me you're by the road don't leave when God when Jesus went away the musicians can come when Jesus was on the earth he said I go and prepare a place for you and I'll come back and receive CE you to myself that where I am there ye may be also in the church age book brother R said he quotes Revelations 3:22 he says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he said this is the last warning they will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paved the gates of gigantic pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heaven beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly it's already ready it's already it's all right now just empty waiting for you for she glistens and shines with a glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace in Jesus's love as we walk through that City we're going to come across certain details no doubt because of this right here and it's going to remind us of things that he did of his grace on our lives she is a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth I would say yes yes Lord I would say yes because he also said there was going to be a bride without spot and without wrinkle the faith that Abel had sister Whitney you have the faith that Enoch had you have the faith that Jesus had you have amen that's right that's the kind of Faith why because God in his Mercy saved a seventh star to the very last agage and he sent the star when he released it out of his hand and because you listened to a humble man who had his own struggles had his own ways but yet you could look past that and you could hear the voice of God speaking through him you humbled yourself to that and that changed you and now that has actually restored your heart back to that same faith that they had on the day of Pentecost same Holy Ghost same acts same Works God bless you Saints love you with all of our heart amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord would you stand for us this evening my I I have absolutely loved every second of that that was powerful powerful brother

Christ amen amen I've come to praise him tonight amen we're looking in the scriptures this evening after that right there it's kind of like wow I tell you what I've always called I've always called him and the tall and dark angel he's a handsome he's a handsome Angel never mind he just proved it tonight he did I was like oh my goodness stop worrying and start trusting God Amen that's exactly right amen it certainly is good to be here amen I'll let you have your seats in just a moment faith in God's word I'm going to take it a desire to go beyond your own abilities amen we have to have that we can't do it on our own when they asked me to preach the other day on this worldwide web thing that he's got going on they see everything out there you don't believe me watch it sometime and he asked me I instantly went into a fetal position because there's many people preached here I I think about all the message that's been preached here all the great you know when you coming in my wife is over there and she's like just be yourself so y'all be careful amen we're looking into the scriptures this evening and I don't mean to preach on you but it's just what the Lord laid on my heart and so we want to look at it Exodus four and verse six amen I got to keep up with the time I got to do as much as I can in 20 minutes amen and the Lord said furthermore unto him this is God speaking to Moses put forth thine hand into my bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprosy as snow and he said put thine hand into my bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh and shall it come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken unto thy voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken to thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and poured on the dry land and the water that thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the land and Moses said unto the Lord oh my Lord I am not eloquent neither hither to hither four nor since thou Hast spoken unto thy servant but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue and the Lord said unto him who hath made man's mouth or who maketh the dumb or the death or the sin or the blind have not I the Lord may the Lord add His blessings to his word am man you may be seated this evening we see it we see we're coming to we're coming to a point when we looking at Moses standing here he's been to the burning bush he's tried it within himself to be the deliverer he had heard all the stories you've heard the message you're going to be part of the Bride of Jesus Christ and you know you're hearing these messages and what I want to do is take and stir the faith that was in you to realize that this is just not words that's laying here and your desire his desire Moses was to to deliver the the Israelites and delivered them out of that bondage that they were in because he seen them as mud dobers and we see what was going going on but what happened when God actually came to him and spoke to him you know when Ronald asked me I went into that fetal position within my mind because in my flesh side I don't want to fail the bride I don't want to say a word that would be incorrect and you know when you're when you're up here you're getting into the emotions and you feel it and it's a pulling and a drawing but what we want to do is get beyond what this man can do we want to get step into a realm that's more than what what man can give you we looking into a realm that desire is to be more like Jesus Christ and to become more like him you had to surrender yourself over to him amen as we we'll proceed on we'll see Jesus had to surrender himself but here's Moses he's having to surrender over God said I'll be with you I'll be in you until the end of the world and me he's telling Moses I'll be with you I will grant whatever you ask I'm going to give it to you and we look at him he's he's still in that fetal I cannot I don't know if I can do it I don't know many times we said here let's look at it in the reality side you said it 24 is coming in how many you making New Year resolutions oh come on all right we got six eight people here that's making New Year's resolutions nobody can look back at 2023 and go well I would like to do this better and I I'm going to loseing weight I want to lose some weight and I'm gonna take $20 and I'm gonna put it into a bank and I'm I'm at piggy bank and by the end of the year I'll have ,20 I cheated one week all right what happens you have a desire but you get can't get beyond your own ability because all of a sudden I'm 231 yeah and now I I diet for a little bit and I'm 230 Glory I'm 2:30 next week I get back on there oh oh that donut sorry ah 2:30 I'm holding on I'm holding M the next week it's all out Donuts it's all eaten and you all of a sudden you done forgot what you doing your ability leans a lot on what's in your heart and your mind I want to be a closer Christian with God I want to read my Bible every day I want to do look at it look at it in a sensible Christian you work to be as a Christian you are to read your Bible every day you are to be studying about the word of God this is basic Christianity we're looking at your ability has to change I listen to my boy over here and I listen to Michael they're they got their Bibles and they're reading they're reading asking me questions and they're they're showing where they're getting answers and I'm like glory to God they're just going strong and you know it just makes me feel good inside they've not lost that desire do not lose your first love for Jesus Christ amen and I hear it and I'm like well I need to try that you know you know he's like well he said do this and do this you what is it it's God what you want to do to serve God you got to go beyond your own ability because I'm I tell you that devil Satan is going to stand there and he's going to beat you in the morning he's waiting on you to get up oh when he gets up he's going to have a pain oh oh I've got a pain coming for him I got something going to go on what you do you get up and you set them two feet on the floor I stubbed my toe and broke it right on my Chester drawers because I was trying to get out too quick and I'm going to tell you what there's some thoughts that goes through your head but you don't let them out you say Thank you Lord L I got two feet to put on my this floor I got two feet I got another nine toes that I can use to keep me going but I'm looking at it going I'm not going to give that devil credit that I can sit there and I can ball him out amen we're going into 2024 to become better we're looking for more in 2024 amen more what is that the Bride of Jesus Christ is getting ready for a pulling away here's here's Moses I don't want to get get away from where here he is he's in there and he's fighting everything he can he'd already seen the burning bush he' already walked up to the burning bush and it talked to him it was God talking to him take off your shoes and and be comfortable amen be comfortable walk before me holy amen that's the way we should be tonight is walking holy before the Lord amen the Lord Jesus Christ amen recognize who your savior is more now than ever amen and we look at him he's sitting there but he's looking at and giving him every excuse that he can that he can't save he can't do nothing I can't do what you're asking me to do lord I can't I can't do that there was one time I couldn't play a good AR that's now amen but I looked at it there was a gentleman told me you can't do it unless you try you've got the purpose within your heart that you want to play a guitar now I can play a guitar but I feel really good about myself as long as I don't hear nobody else when I get to hearing this young man oh yeah back here he starts tearing it up and strings are smoking up here and everything's just in fine tune I'm like oh I got to go back to I got to go back to the altar again Lord help me I got to do better that's exactly the way it is when you see somebody shouting and praising God you need to jump right on in there say I'm com to praise God tonight am man I've come to lift up his name I've come to praise him and thank him he got me through another week he got me through another year this ain't just another time that we come together and say well it's the end of this and we got to start something new no what you need to do is do a carryover amen and continue to move forward with Jesus Christ many people want to start over amen they'll build a house so far and it's like well it ain't too good tear it down they'll build it back again I watched my kids when they're building something it ain't exactly right to tear it back down instead of fixing what's already there and continuing to add unto it what we need to do is continue to build on what God's given us amen what Moses was doing he was Finding excuses and reasons why he couldn't excel in Jesus Christ he couldn't Excel because what he couldn't surrender he couldn't surrender his life over to Jesus Christ he couldn't surr surrendered over to God Amen to let God have full control of his life brother Brandon he said here he is he he said he talks about it he he he was he he was no way he was going to be in that that he could go to the Kings and monarchs and how how was it going to happen and him being not being able to talk and to stutter and do much like what I'm doing right now you know you trying he was trying to find the words because the eloquencer was other preachers out there that was preaching you know you look at it I look at Ron right here right here's a man that's going through hell on this Earth amen but when when he doesn't back up when he gets up here when he gets to going I can tell you there's a lot of times when he he took a break I'm like how's he doing that and there's people just praising God and lifting up God what is it it's something on the inside of him that's coming over this pull pit that's showing my God still heals he's still delivered trust me and I will use you like never before and he took a hold of that his faith laid more in it than just saying well I'm just a preacher I'm a just Pastor he said God's going to use me like never before at that time you did not know what he was going to use you for amen that Moses did not know what was going to go on he did not know he didn't not know how he was going to go down there a one man with a with a rod in his hand he's watched it and all this stuff Ron didn't know what was going to go on in his life when he said when he said I will trust you I will believe whatever you're going to use before use it use me you know it's the same thing when I sat over there God said you have an ability abity to use what I've given unto you amen and that's where he's at he has nobody can speak I just read it this evening nobody no two preachers are alike amen and if they're alike one of's a fake I'll just tell you that now amen because God moves on you the whole body is made up by many different members of the body amen it takes us all in her there's going to be people that clap their hands there's going to be people that shout there's going to be people that preach and sing and Lord have mercy I tell you Andrew and and y'all can sing good good Lord y'all got some singers down here but you get in the presence of God and all of a sudden you join your lick of fire it's like in his body amen the lung look hooked up to the heart and the blood's running through there and it's getting it moving amen your body starts going what is it it's a body working together amen it's a body moving and getting the Praises and the presence of God because what you have to do is surrender yourself amen but you have to have faith to believe God's going to use you like never before God's going to use you like never before and when it's being seen and God seeing that the people are seeing it they look at it on the internet amen you you're looking at you're seeing God moving in y'all's church amen you're seeing God move around the Bride of Jesus Christ around the world just not here but in the churches there there's Miracles taken places amen because someone has accepted the word of God by my stripes you are healed amen by my stripes I'll be there with you amen I thank God for you all being here I thank God for my my crew being here amen I got amen they take up the front row y'all must have got here early cuz they love the front row amen but I'm looking at it I'm saying you know you look at it because if you have a desire to go beyond your own abilities that means that you have something inside of you that says it's not me that does the work but it's him that does the work through me amen and we look at that and Moses here he is and you know you say well you know well well here I want to I want to I want to be more of a Christian next year I want you know that's that's most time that's one of them leaflets amen amen I put something in my Bible there back before dad passed away and I put it in there I need to know the leadership of the Holy Ghost on what to do with the church because the church had dwindle down to a couple people I put it in her I written it in her ask God for the answer within 30 days we had the answer not the kind of answer I was looking for but God sometimes will push you into a place and close all the doors I heard it spoke this week he put you into a place that you have to believe on God you have to have faith to believe to make the word work within you because if you can't believe it yourself he's going to put you into a place you have to lean on God Amen and we looked at and I said you know I said now our church is it's it's growing it's going good amen the power of God comes down you say well I it's not big enough for all y'all I just tell you if y'all come come to my church there wouldn't be enough room but we'd find something but I look at it I said you know God has a way of making everyone work together I say if we ain't nothing more than the pancreas of the body of Jesus Christ amen we may be the smallest Church there is amen but I'm here to tell you that pancreas you ask oh Patrick swy you don't have a pancreas no matter how good looking you are you're gone without us you can't move on Amen without you we can't move on we're a bride of Jesus Christ that's been sent to this layot ofy and age that's been brought to a point that says I am going beyond my own ability I am going beyond my own thinking this evening I am going to be the Bride of Jesus Christ the bride hath made herself ready we seen her a while ago standing there anticipating the coming of the lord it's going beyond your own ability that's where we need to find ourselves this morning amen is to looking at it and saying I thank God that I felt the tug i f thank God that I have felt the pull amen but many times we fail within our own selves to say I cannot believe that I'm a part of the Bride of Jesus Christ I'm not good enough I'm not eloquent enough I'm here to tell you I I you you sometimes we compare ourselves to the denominal churches out there we compare ourselves to sin I'll just put it like that they get to do what they want to do amen they get to they get to live like they want to but I'm here to tell you there's a place that the Bride of Jesus Christ is going to be is walking on the streets of gold Amen to an overcomer that he's going to be there amen an overcomer in somebody just slipped in by the skin on her teeth it's somebody that overcome some battles overcome themselves surrender their themselves over to God Amen because many people want it so easy they want it so easy they can walk in and say well hey I'm made it I'm the most popular singer there is in church I'm here to tell you if they didn't I told Ron I told him he was talking about me coming up here and he said why don't you just come up here to church I said the only way I come up pray is you don't ever invite me up there to sing or to preach I want to just come praise God that's the way I like it amen coming and praising God Amen lifting up his name and thanking him for what he's done for it amen I looked at I said God had a plan that we would have that little church down there Amen to show that we're a lighthouse y'all y'all the lighthouse on this hill he man when people are turning I honestly I'll be honest I seen so many policemen sitting down here a while ago I was like Lord there they're doing a drug bust or something up there like man there was police lined up all the way down through there I was like what the bride do today oh my but you know what that's just the devil trying to get your mind off of what's going on cuz when you entered into those doors back her you didn't come in going well I made it to another service no you come in hungry man you come in hungry when I went to Ron's today when I got in there and they had the food laid out and the the buffet was laid out am man they didn't go in there go well I'm full they don't have what I like you know what I started eating and I started eating and that word of God that we are eating on this is so fresh and so new amen it's just freshness all around amen what's it doing it's helping you to overcome your own disabilities amen and turning them into abilities amen that you can serve God more because you know he's going to answer my prayer he's going to be there with me and what did Moses have to do he had to come to realization he said I'm not just a man God's moving through me I've got to accept it with it myself I've been told it my family's told it I actually killed an Egyptian how's he going to do man my failures and all of a sudden he talks himself back out of it again you know it's like that's exactly the way the devil does he will come along he'll continue to attack that's his job and if he's attacking you I'm here to tell you you got something he wants amen many times you say well I'm I just can't get up because every time I get up I get knocked back down glory to God things are going to happen in this life because what what they doing it's groaning for the change there's a life inside of you that's more than your own it's your ability to get back up it's your ability to stand up and say unto that mountain be thou removed amen because the faith that lays within that word of God Amen the faith that lays there will bring you into the Perfection of Jesus Christ within yourself because that's where we're looking at we're looking at it from God's point of view he predestinated you yes sir he opened up your eyes of understanding am mean he awoke you from the sickness that you was in the world he woke you into this the light of the light of God that we could keep our eyes on him amen that we could look to him even in the darkest of times I watched the songs being sang I didn't know them all but I looked at him and I a lot of time he like lights up those Shadows light up those Shadows amen but what's he doing he's enlightening your life to become more into the word of God Amen everybody wants to go in they going in 2024 I want more of Jesus I want more of Jesus I want more of Jesus I want more of Jesus I want more of Jesus Amen but we need to start going I need to surrender more of me I need to surrender more of me I need to surrender more of me you surrender more of me I get more Jesus amen because what you're doing you're surren ending your will and your ability over to Jesus Christ to move you into a realm that you're no longer living a part of this world you're looking for that change when you take that step in the morning you're like could this be the morning could this be the morning I walk into perfect healing could this be the morning that I walk into my new body amen could this be I preached a funeral today 90 years old lady anden I looked at it I said you know that that woman lived 90 years they couldn't think of anything and I was like my goodness out 90 years what could happen I look at it for you all if we live to be 90 if we live to be 100 or 120 we could still say I live for Jesus Christ every moment that I was here every breath that you take you're looking at I watched a man going through some stuff L last week and I was like every every moment he was going through something and you know it was like I was like my goodness you know but in my my mind I was going there's nothing I can do but the whole time I'm sitting there Lord Jesus I'm asking you to come what's going on right now I don't don't understand it but you do I'm asking God help him right now he can't help himself but you said you'd be an everpresent help in the time of need many times we forget when we go to battle we got to pull our sword and that sword is Jesus Christ amen amen it's no time to go into a fetal setback position it's a time to step forward in the word of God Amen be diligent about the work amen be diligent about studying the Bibles and learning more about his love amen learning you say well well what happened but Jesus well let's look at it thank you Jesus said it like this right here yeah if I can find it really quick Jesus when he went into the Garden of Gethsemane I'm not going to read it but here goes God in flesh walking into the garden he walked in there in pain and Agony yes sir he had had something a burden within him I'm here to save the world he was here but what did he do he cried he prayed he prayed so long until his blood became his te teardrops of blood as they were coming out and he was pressing he was looking for what can I do let this cup pass for me Lord let this cup pass for me and he went back and his his his head disciples that were there with him were asleep yeah they weren't in his pain he had to go at it alone you many times think you have to go at it alone you're that is the individual walk of the Gentiles it's been given to us that we're individuals we're not saved as a nation but I look at it and I say I want my walk to be so close with Jesus Christ that if my time comes at this moment I will step from this moral immortality amen there's nothing to cry about I step from here to there and I'm good amen I'll be there wherefore we're so compassed about with such a great a cloud of witnesses amen lay aside that sin that so easy beset you and run this race with patience and be ready amen that's what we've got to do but I looked at it here's Jesus as he's walking in that Garden he's looking for and he's looking for something different than God's will but he finally surrendered if Jesus had to surrender his own will not my will but thine will be done that's a the same thing we need to do you got to have enough Faith to believe I have a purpose in this life if it takes me preaching singing running dancing praising God laying hands on the sick I want to do what I need to do to be up building the kingdom of God I want to praise him more every day I want to lift up his name more every day and I don't want to ever lose sight of where I'm going amen because the devil is going to give you Blindside you every once in a while amen but sometimes he'll come in he'll come in really soft we got to be ready for his cunning activities but we look at it we are looking Beyond where we're at right now Moses had to realize that I am not going to be doing this on my own God's going to be with me the god of Abraham is going to be with me I will walk with him I will talk with him he will be there he will give me guidance and you know God had so much trust in him that what he said what Moses said it would happen he knew he wasn't going to ask ask anything we don't go and ask for Golden doors and don't ask for Golden House what we're looking for is a rebuilding of Jesus Christ inside of our life before 2024 comes in I want to have God so much in me that I the angels are around me all the time amen that they're welcome here amen you look at it you say well I want to be that it's only because of God that you can be what you are today amen because God one day come by and talk to you he may talk to you in a burning bush he may have come through with just a simple little preacher that came up and said I want y'all to pray for me I have this going on and you don't know what's going on but I believe God's going to touch me God's going to use me like never before and he's been very humble in what he's done that's my brother he's been very humble yes sir God's took people y'all's church has been hit multiple times but those are over there praying don't give up now don't give up now don't you give up up you keep pressing forward to the mark of the High Calling brother Ms we
