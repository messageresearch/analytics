[50:28] back to it I thought Andrew just did
[50:30] such a wonderful job last night I was so
[50:33] blessed I I was so blessed Revelations
[50:36] chapter 5 and this is very familiar to
[50:38] the bride of Christ and I saw in the
[50:40] right hand of him that sat upon the
[50:42] throne a book written within and on the
[50:44] backside seal with Seven
[50:46] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[50:49] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[50:52] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[50:54] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[50:57] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[51:00] able to open the book neither to look
[51:03] thereon and I wept much because no man
[51:06] was found worthy to open and to read the
[51:08] book neither to look thereon and one of
[51:12] the Elder saith unto me weep not Behold
[51:15] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[51:17] of David hath prevailed to open the book
[51:20] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[51:23] I beheld and low in the midst of the
[51:25] throne and of the four Beast and the
[51:28] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[51:30] had been slain having seven horns and
[51:33] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[51:35] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[51:38] he came and took the book out of the
[51:40] right hand of him that sat on the throne
[51:42] upon the throne and when he had taken
[51:44] the book and the four Beast and the four
[51:46] and 20 ERS Elders fell down before the
[51:50] lamb having every one of them hearts and
[51:53] golden vials full of odors which are the
[51:56] the prayers of the Saints and they sung
[51:59] a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to
[52:03] take the book and to open the seals
[52:05] thereof for thou was slain and Hast
[52:07] redeemed us to God by the blood of of
[52:10] every Kindred tongue and people and
[52:13] nation and has made us unto our God
[52:17] Kings and Priests and we shall reign
[52:21] upon the Earth you may be seated amen
[52:25] God bless you
[52:27] God bless you for your patience with
[52:30] us I just want to start at an
[52:32] interesting spot and I think it's very
[52:35] powerful brother bandam was talking
[52:38] about a place to where that there was a
[52:40] conventions of the religions of the
[52:42] world and he just kind of steps into
[52:44] this brother Bram wasn't there he's only
[52:46] quoting from it he said here some years
[52:49] ago they had a religions of the world
[52:51] met and I was reading in a book that
[52:54] they had had this lady makabe from
[52:58] Oklahoma here that's
[53:01] arrested out there that might have been
[53:04] in Tulsa one of these places and she was
[53:07] running through the streets driving
[53:08] stage coach and smoking a cigar and
[53:11] breaking the city limits with a stage
[53:16] coach and all the religions different
[53:20] religions raised up and told their part
[53:22] of of their religion and how great it
[53:25] was
[53:27] and the Muhammad's priest told how great
[53:31] his religion
[53:35] was and the Buddha told how great his
[53:38] religion was and a certain little
[53:41] Minister I can't call his name now was
[53:44] rep was representing the religion of
[53:46] America Christian religion and when he
[53:49] got his time to the platform he told the
[53:52] story of this great foul woman how low
[53:56] down that she was till they didn't even
[53:58] want to get get around her to even get
[54:01] close enough to to her to Tar and
[54:04] feather
[54:05] her she was so immoral she was so
[54:09] degraded there was nothing that could
[54:11] help
[54:13] her and he and he stops and he says
[54:16] Gentlemen of the religions of the
[54:20] world can
[54:22] your
[54:24] religious produce anything that would
[54:26] cleanse the hands of this certain very
[54:31] fou vow
[54:33] person everyone sat
[54:36] quiet right on the end of their seats no
[54:39] man saying
[54:41] nothing and then he jumped in the air
[54:43] and screamed and kicked his heels
[54:45] together and he said the blood of Jesus
[54:49] Christ won't only cleanse her hands but
[54:52] it'll clean her heart and make her pure
[54:55] as a lily the blood of the Lord Jesus
[54:58] Christ takes away sins and cleanses us
[55:01] from all iniquity and makes us new
[55:03] creatures in Christ Jesus nothing else
[55:07] will do
[55:09] it I like that nothing else will do it
[55:13] Creeds and forms and nothing
[55:16] else will take its place it's been
[55:22] try but it takes the blood amen it takes
[55:26] the blood of Jesus Christ and nothing
[55:33] else nothing else will do it what will
[55:37] take away our sins nothing but the blood
[55:40] of
[55:41] Jesus I read you Revelations chapter 5
[55:44] because it's our part It's the opening
[55:47] of the book the seals are no longer
[55:50] they're no longer hidden the mysterious
[55:53] Thunders are no longer mysterious
[55:57] and we are the people of the open book
[56:02] not just this church but bride around
[56:05] the world small churches big churches
[56:09] people that are on the internet that
[56:11] have no churches that tune into to us
[56:14] we're represented as the the people of
[56:18] the open book The Bible's not closed to
[56:21] us it's not mysterious to us because the
[56:25] author of the book came and revealed
[56:30] himself to the Bride of Jesus
[56:34] Christ brother random would use the
[56:37] statement he says you're not feeding on
[56:38] the mind of a
[56:41] man but you're feeding on the body word
[56:45] of the son of man this was more than the
[56:48] personality of a great personable
[56:53] preacher but this was Jesus Christ
[56:55] coming to this
[56:57] generation to get a bride ready call her
[57:00] out come out of her my people and to
[57:03] call her out to prepare her with a
[57:06] message that would dress her for the
[57:10] wedding
[57:12] supper and to take us and call for
[57:15] resurrection and take us in a Rapture
[57:18] not just for some temporary meeting for
[57:23] eternity your amen should have been
[57:25] better than
[57:28] that that's our expectations that's the
[57:31] results of this
[57:33] message this message did not come to
[57:36] produce a bunch of churches or a bunch
[57:39] of Kingdom Builders this message came to
[57:42] prepare a bride for Jesus
[57:47] Christ now now in deity of Jesus Christ
[57:51] 1949 brother BR says this Jesus comes
[57:55] three times
[57:57] he came the first time to redeem his
[57:59] church he comes the second time to
[58:02] receive his church he comes the third
[58:05] time with his church everything in the
[58:09] Bible travels in trinities he said
[58:12] threes but all in one Christ remember
[58:16] the first time to redeem his church the
[58:18] second time to receive his church the
[58:21] third time with his church as king and
[58:25] queen Amen in the breach he he shares
[58:29] some things with us just to lay a
[58:30] foundation just for a few moments he
[58:33] said the bride the lamb is the only
[58:37] mediator he is the only one that came
[58:41] forth and what did he do now he's back
[58:46] here
[58:47] interceding until his blood has atoned
[58:50] for every person and the lamb knows
[58:55] knows what's written in the book so he
[58:59] knowed from the foundation of the world
[59:02] their names were in there so he stood
[59:05] back here and he says remember he said
[59:09] but done the mediatorial work like this
[59:13] until the mediatorial work till everyone
[59:17] that's been put in the book has been
[59:20] redeemed I love that's enough to shout
[59:23] for a while and it's finished and now he
[59:26] walks out he's done the Kinsman work he
[59:30] is all you know what the Kinsman work
[59:32] was to testify before the elders you
[59:36] remember Boaz kicking off his shoe and
[59:39] so
[59:40] forth he has done all this
[59:44] now he's done all this now and now he
[59:48] comes to take his
[59:50] bride and now he comes to take his bride
[59:54] amen he comes now now his King he is
[59:57] looking for his
[1:00:02] queen that Queen is no longer just in a
[1:00:07] book it's no longer just in a
[1:00:10] book you're rubbing
[1:00:12] shoulders I love that brother Jim we're
[1:00:15] rubbing shoulders with one
[1:00:20] another thank you
[1:00:23] Lord he says amen amen
[1:00:26] he said in this book is the whole secret
[1:00:29] of it wrapped up around Seven Seals oh
[1:00:33] brother Seven Seals waiting for him to
[1:00:37] come I love that don't
[1:00:39] you what is it bringing everything to
[1:00:43] order I think about our freedom and what
[1:00:45] it
[1:00:47] cost I I just want to grab grab
[1:00:50] something here real
[1:00:52] quick Billy Graham in the height
[1:00:56] in the height
[1:00:58] of of racial dis
[1:01:03] War stood to his feet
[1:01:06] and and I so happened to be watching
[1:01:10] that
[1:01:10] night
[1:01:12] and and there was a lot of tension in
[1:01:16] America Satan always does that because
[1:01:20] real Christians don't have any prejudice
[1:01:26] I want to say that real Christians have
[1:01:28] no Prejudice we're all
[1:01:34] family and he began to talk about
[1:01:36] slavery and he talked about you know he
[1:01:40] said so many people go to the black
[1:01:42] slavery so many people go to to the
[1:01:44] Chinese slavery if you know what Chinese
[1:01:47] were were used as slaves in our in our
[1:01:50] early part as well and then and then the
[1:01:53] Philippines and then and then a lot of
[1:01:54] different places
[1:01:56] but the but the most difficult was
[1:01:59] Jewish
[1:02:03] slavery and then he began to make some
[1:02:05] statements he said since Adam we've all
[1:02:08] been sold into slavery and I thought
[1:02:11] that was
[1:02:13] incredible since Adam we've all been
[1:02:15] sold into
[1:02:17] slavery and he makes a statement he
[1:02:21] says he said only one could pay the
[1:02:24] price
[1:02:27] only only one could pay the
[1:02:30] price now brother brandham would make a
[1:02:34] statement and I I want to just carry
[1:02:35] this for a bit he said now there was a
[1:02:38] man his name was Abraham
[1:02:40] Lincoln he said one of the greatest men
[1:02:42] Kentucky ever produced in my opinion and
[1:02:46] Abraham Lincoln when he got off of the
[1:02:48] boat down there in New
[1:02:49] Orleans he send them he seen them
[1:02:52] auction some colored people off as a
[1:02:55] slave a big heavy man a little a little
[1:02:58] poor little wife and children standing
[1:03:01] out
[1:03:04] crying bred him like cattle to bigger
[1:03:08] heavier women to make better
[1:03:12] slaves Lincoln as many as you know in
[1:03:15] the history when he folded his hands and
[1:03:18] smacked him together
[1:03:20] said that's wrong
[1:03:23] amen I'd like to Echo that thought
[1:03:26] that's
[1:03:28] wrong and he says and by the help of
[1:03:32] God and this is a powerful statement by
[1:03:35] the help of God if it takes my
[1:03:38] life I'll hit it with all that I've
[1:03:44] got amen and brother brandom said and he
[1:03:50] did he said then I think of a great
[1:03:52] noted man who died this is another
[1:03:54] sermon he said said believe in our Lord
[1:03:57] Jesus Christ and his resurrection I
[1:03:59] think of D Moody and at his death and a
[1:04:03] lot of have said why is is this death
[1:04:07] and he said this is my coronation day
[1:04:10] and I thought of John Wesley when he was
[1:04:13] dying and and when Abraham Lincoln was
[1:04:15] shot and bleeding to death laying in a
[1:04:18] place he said I passed by a museum over
[1:04:21] here in Illinois here some time ago we
[1:04:23] drove by that museum not long ago AG go
[1:04:26] and he says I seen an aged colored man
[1:04:29] with a little ring of white hair around
[1:04:32] his head walking around looking and he
[1:04:34] says after a while he stopped and and
[1:04:37] the tears running down his cheeks and he
[1:04:40] backed off and started saying over a
[1:04:42] prayer and I watched him over a few
[1:04:45] moments and he said I was walking around
[1:04:47] too and I was walking over and I said
[1:04:50] Uncle what's the matter I I not I notice
[1:04:54] you're praying and he said look laying
[1:04:58] here and he said well I look laying
[1:05:00] there and only thing that I could see
[1:05:02] was a dress and and he said only thing I
[1:05:05] see is a dress and he said but look sir
[1:05:09] beneath my coat is a scar of the slave
[1:05:12] belt and that's the Blood of Abraham
[1:05:15] Lincoln it's taken the Blood of Abraham
[1:05:18] Lincoln to take that slave belt off of
[1:05:23] Meen
[1:05:26] now I think about the Providence of
[1:05:29] these two men standing at this spot and
[1:05:33] here's a man with a with the marks of a
[1:05:36] slave belt on him he's an older man and
[1:05:39] he's got the marks of a slave belt on
[1:05:41] him and here stands a prophet of God
[1:05:44] standing beside of
[1:05:47] him looking at Abraham Lincoln's blood
[1:05:51] and here's a prophet that is going to
[1:05:53] stand in a place to where that the the
[1:05:57] king of the
[1:05:58] throne is going to come and open the
[1:06:02] book and he's going to tell you you're
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:08] free you're
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:23] free and I thought if it would excite a
[1:06:26] colored man because of the Blood of
[1:06:28] Abraham
[1:06:29] Lincoln because had taken a slave belt
[1:06:32] off of
[1:06:33] him notice these words what ought to the
[1:06:37] blood of Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ mean to the
[1:06:41] believer when we look back to Calvary
[1:06:45] and see there that he was taken off of
[1:06:47] the slave bolt of Sin from our hearts
[1:06:51] and freed us and we've been talking
[1:06:53] about the last few night what difference
[1:06:56] it
[1:06:57] is Abraham Lincoln when he was dying he
[1:07:00] had he had an ultimate ultimated he says
[1:07:03] and when he he said but when he was shot
[1:07:06] there and this great Cathedral when he
[1:07:09] was dying in his bed he said turned my
[1:07:12] face towards the setting into the sun
[1:07:15] the sun was going down in evening and
[1:07:17] Lincoln was breathing the blood gurgling
[1:07:20] into his lungs and he had always trusted
[1:07:23] God he said hold up my my
[1:07:28] hands and he held up his hands and he
[1:07:30] said Our Father who are thou in heaven
[1:07:34] Hallowed be thy name and he bowed his
[1:07:37] head and gave up his
[1:07:47] spirit I know you're not deaf and dumb
[1:07:50] but what a disgrace for America this
[1:07:52] week
[1:08:03] thank God for men like Abraham
[1:08:09] Lincoln thank
[1:08:15] God I think about I think
[1:08:19] about
[1:08:22] slavery I think about the underground
[1:08:27] railroad that that begin to be such a
[1:08:30] huge
[1:08:33] thing to where that Harriet tman would
[1:08:37] be one of the movers of that a woman
[1:08:40] along with many other people that would
[1:08:43] begin to try to
[1:08:45] get the slaves to
[1:08:48] freedom I think I what a what a what a
[1:08:50] great thing it was and I have to be
[1:08:52] honest with you I've spent a few I spent
[1:08:53] a few days this week on my my
[1:08:57] honeymoon and here I'm on my honeymoon
[1:08:59] and God is talking to me about
[1:09:02] slavery and what it's like for Harriet
[1:09:06] tudman to be inspired to risk her own
[1:09:10] life to try to get people
[1:09:13] free and how that she set up an
[1:09:15] underground railroad with safe houses to
[1:09:19] get people from slavery that they would
[1:09:22] have never got out of
[1:09:24] Amen to move them to a place that they
[1:09:27] could have freedom and where there was
[1:09:29] safe
[1:09:31] houses I don't know where you know this
[1:09:33] or not but that's what we
[1:09:37] are we're a safe house
[1:09:39] [Applause]
[1:09:41] here and we're doing our very best to
[1:09:44] get people
[1:09:46] free from
[1:09:49] sin from
[1:09:51] religions from the concentration camps
[1:09:54] of of religious
[1:09:58] systems there's a
[1:10:01] blood I want to say there's a blood that
[1:10:05] can cleanse not only your hands but can
[1:10:08] cleanse your
[1:10:09] heart cleanse your mind cleanse your
[1:10:15] thoughts it's not just another vow to to
[1:10:19] bring you to a higher order and we're
[1:10:21] not just for another church but we're
[1:10:24] free
[1:10:26] we're
[1:10:28] free and you really don't know what
[1:10:30] freedom is or have an appreciation for
[1:10:33] Freedom unless you've been a
[1:10:39] slave and if you've been a slave you
[1:10:42] know the
[1:10:45] control the control of sin and habits
[1:10:49] the control of friendships the control
[1:10:52] of peer pressure
[1:10:56] the control of intellectualism the
[1:10:59] control of Creeds and dogmas and Mom and
[1:11:02] Dad's
[1:11:03] religion there's a control there's a
[1:11:05] slave belt that goes with all of those
[1:11:07] things but when you hear the
[1:11:11] voice the voice behind the voice and it
[1:11:15] immediately responds in your
[1:11:18] soul that's real
[1:11:20] [Applause]
[1:11:34] now let me just spend a moment
[1:11:37] here they had to have
[1:11:42] signals cuz it had to be at the risk of
[1:11:45] their
[1:11:46] lives they had to leave with the clothes
[1:11:49] on their back they couldn't pack
[1:11:51] anything so they had
[1:11:53] to they had to Risk

[1:19:13] children yeah I'm going to do that a
[1:19:15] while I I'm just a Doty
[1:19:18] granddaddy thank you you can be
[1:19:21] seated you see it was in 1961 I was
[1:19:26] born and my dad was a part of the grew
[1:19:30] up in the Church of God
[1:19:32] movement Pentecostal movement tent
[1:19:35] meetings
[1:19:37] everywhere my dad was
[1:19:39] a eighth
[1:19:41] child and in my in my family there were
[1:19:46] women
[1:19:47] preachers and my
[1:19:50] grandmother my grandmother was my
[1:19:53] grandfather was a preacher but he was
[1:19:56] not one that I would want to be very
[1:19:58] proud of just
[1:19:59] now and he was gifted extremely gifted
[1:20:04] but actually he would take people by the
[1:20:06] hand and this will sound familiar but
[1:20:08] his thumb would change
[1:20:11] colors but but let me just say he didn't
[1:20:13] live a life he didn't have a life to go
[1:20:16] with all that my grandmother was a real
[1:20:19] Christian that's what held solid for
[1:20:23] many my my father came in contact with
[1:20:26] the message
[1:20:28] 1961 you know there even being raised in
[1:20:31] that Pentecostal or even a uh assembly
[1:20:35] or even Church of God
[1:20:36] movement you know he saw all of that
[1:20:39] taking place but when he came to the
[1:20:43] message he
[1:20:45] immediately he
[1:20:47] immediately began to preach God had sent
[1:20:50] a prophet and as he be to preach and
[1:20:53] then he got the Holy Ghost and my mother
[1:20:55] was a Methodist girl and actually my dad
[1:20:58] said I can't date you no more because
[1:21:00] you won't believe the message and she
[1:21:02] said Charlie give me a
[1:21:05] chance my mother would receive the Holy
[1:21:07] Ghost and and she would begin to follow
[1:21:10] the message they were married after
[1:21:12] three years of dating I came along
[1:21:14] exactly nine years nine months later and
[1:21:19] and so then we had a small house it was
[1:21:22] a cinder block house and and I remember
[1:21:25] as a little child and me and my brother
[1:21:27] was in a was was in room we just had one
[1:21:30] room there in that for us to to enjoy it
[1:21:33] and my dad would pray right under our
[1:21:35] floor and he would pray hours at night
[1:21:38] and I would hear him speaking in tongues
[1:21:40] and all those different things and and
[1:21:42] he was extremely it was extremely
[1:21:44] blessed man we had an extremely blessed
[1:21:46] home we wasn't Rich by any counts of any
[1:21:50] imagination but I grew up believing the
[1:21:52] message of the hour hearing the
[1:21:55] tapes my brother and myself would stand
[1:21:58] and compete try to finish the quotes
[1:22:00] that would take place and and so but
[1:22:03] listen you can know all the quotes and
[1:22:05] you know all the books and you have all
[1:22:06] the pictures but if you don't have him
[1:22:08] you don't have
[1:22:10] anything and we grew up and we went to
[1:22:12] church listen there was weeks where they
[1:22:15] have a Revival for weeks at a time every
[1:22:18] night every night every night if you're
[1:22:20] a poor person gas is still gas no matter
[1:22:23] how much it is it's still high and so
[1:22:27] Dad would run out of money and countless
[1:22:30] times my dad would have us to pray my
[1:22:33] brother will hear this tonight my
[1:22:35] brother my dad would have us to pray and
[1:22:38] we would pray and and we look for Furs
[1:22:43] on the side of the road a a kill fox or
[1:22:47] a kill
[1:22:50] skunk or a kill raccoon and we would
[1:22:53] take that thing home home and dad had a
[1:22:55] post with a little rope with a little
[1:22:57] thing hanging on it and he would hook
[1:22:59] that mouth and we would stand there and
[1:23:02] hold the Animal by the tail and we'd
[1:23:04] stand there and he would skin it out and
[1:23:06] we take and sell it the next day or two
[1:23:09] to have gas to go to
[1:23:15] church listen guys like brother Homer my
[1:23:18] dad men of the message of the hour are
[1:23:21] going to be a testimony
[1:23:25] to people that are don't have passion
[1:23:27] for the
[1:23:30] message let me just say if if you only
[1:23:33] go to church when it's convenient you're
[1:23:36] backslid you're most Lo you're most
[1:23:39] likely lost and need
[1:23:45] God I grew up in that environment here
[1:23:48] in sermon after sermon after sermon and
[1:23:51] you know and and I grew up I was a drum
[1:23:53] player at 7 years old and and you know
[1:23:56] people talk to me about not having drums
[1:23:58] well they're beating on the wrong
[1:24:01] post I played them at seven years old a
[1:24:05] huge set of drums larger than that right
[1:24:07] there I I sat there at that place you
[1:24:10] remember Sister Nancy you remember when
[1:24:13] the Believers came out of
[1:24:15] Canada and they sang at brother fur's
[1:24:18] church
[1:24:19] and brother Min Fen came over to me and
[1:24:22] I was playing the drums and he came over
[1:24:24] to me and patted me on the back and he
[1:24:26] actually took the sticks out of my hand
[1:24:28] and played a little bit himself and I
[1:24:31] grew up listening to men like Junior
[1:24:33] Jackson and men like that and listening
[1:24:36] to George van zberg from Africa I can't
[1:24:40] call them all it's would be a waste of
[1:24:42] time to do that but 1978 a guy named ed
[1:24:45] bcll came to our
[1:24:48] audience and he preached a sermon and he
[1:24:50] actually just you know he he was kind of
[1:24:53] a new BL guy on the block and he just
[1:24:55] kind of shared his testimony calls it
[1:24:57] experiences with the
[1:24:59] prophet you know when I was a young man
[1:25:01] I I didn't know Christ but I went to
[1:25:04] church you can do that you
[1:25:06] know and so I I went to church and what
[1:25:10] he
[1:25:11] said meant much Sarah he's
[1:25:16] okay meant much to
[1:25:19] me
[1:25:21] now now I want to fast forward to 1983
[1:25:24] three Connie and I get
[1:25:26] married and she marries an unconverted
[1:25:29] boy just be very honest with me and even
[1:25:33] brother Homer would apologize later he
[1:25:35] didn't want her to marry me and I
[1:25:39] understand I understand I was
[1:25:42] unconverted and so I'd walked to an
[1:25:46] altar but it was months afterwards that
[1:25:50] that I received the Holy Ghost and it
[1:25:52] was behind a piano
[1:25:55] and you were playing the piano and
[1:25:58] brother Bill Hinkle prayed with me and I
[1:26:01] received the Holy Ghost amen my father
[1:26:05] gave me a church age book and a seal
[1:26:07] book and he said cut your teeth on
[1:26:11] it he said you go through these books
[1:26:15] over and over and over again you go
[1:26:19] through these books that are the most
[1:26:21] important books beside the Bible you go
[1:26:23] through the these
[1:26:27] books you go through these books he
[1:26:30] would later tell me he said I knew you
[1:26:31] were going to be a preacher and you need
[1:26:34] to have the foundation of the message of
[1:26:36] the hour you'd heard the tape she had
[1:26:39] been in the meetings but you needed to
[1:26:41] know what this message said that's
[1:26:45] right come
[1:26:47] on and so listen he was trying to help
[1:26:50] me get my slave belt off
[1:26:54] right and so we would we would go to
[1:26:56] meetings and he told me in 83 he said I
[1:26:59] I'm going to take you to a meeting that
[1:27:01] I think will be very important to you
[1:27:03] and he took me to a meeting where Bobby
[1:27:05] Roy was pastoring the church it was a
[1:27:08] huge audience there Connie and I were
[1:27:10] first married and and so the deacons
[1:27:14] took us in and
[1:27:16] Connie they took her to the Sunday
[1:27:19] school class
[1:27:24] they thought she was too young to be
[1:27:26] sitting in the
[1:27:27] meeting and they they took my dad and
[1:27:30] mom and set them somewhere and they put
[1:27:33] me on the fourth row brother Jordan I
[1:27:35] think you were in the fourth row I I was
[1:27:36] trying to count it a few moments ago you
[1:27:38] were sitting on the fourth row and I was
[1:27:41] sitting almost like you are and I was
[1:27:44] sitting right in the middle and I was
[1:27:46] thinking brother bisco was an older man
[1:27:48] and when he bounced out on the stage
[1:27:50] here he's in his 50s when he bounces out
[1:27:53] on the stage stage he's he's got bounce
[1:27:55] in his steps and he walks out and and
[1:27:58] he's now with a Pentecostal Church
[1:28:01] they're coming into the message but he's
[1:28:03] now in the Pentecostal church and he's
[1:28:05] trying to bring them into the message
[1:28:07] and and what he's doing and he preaches
[1:28:09] a sermon called the breach between the
[1:28:13] church ages and the
[1:28:16] seals you know Connie was gone my
[1:28:19] parents were gone and I was just honed
[1:28:22] in on brother bisc and it seemed like
[1:28:25] much percentage of the time brother bisc
[1:28:27] was preaching to me
[1:28:32] personally and later we would talk about
[1:28:35] that meeting and he said brother Ronnie
[1:28:37] said it was like a light around you and
[1:28:39] I just kept looking and I just couldn't
[1:28:41] help but keep
[1:28:43] looking well I was feasting on the seals
[1:28:46] and the breach and the church age book
[1:28:48] and I was eating it over and over and
[1:28:52] over and I knew that we had moved from
[1:28:54] ausa Street and we had moved from that
[1:28:57] Pentecost yet it was a a move of
[1:29:01] God don't take it away that was a move
[1:29:03] of God bullets falling off of dresses
[1:29:06] people being healed months of meeting at
[1:29:09] a time the tongues being poured out into
[1:29:12] the audience but then men got it and
[1:29:16] denominated
[1:29:19] it and I knew that we' moved on from
[1:29:22] that
[1:29:25] are you with me
[1:29:30] now my father took my
[1:29:33] grandmother and I'm I'm really sorry
[1:29:36] right now what was my grandmother's
[1:29:38] first
[1:29:40] name
[1:29:42] Clara and if you're fighting what I'm
[1:29:44] fighting you you know I have trouble
[1:29:46] with
[1:29:47] memory but Clara was a precious
[1:29:52] woman and I'll just I want to go two
[1:29:54] ways I want to go first of
[1:29:57] all here she was my father would come to
[1:30:00] Sunday meals and he's trying to get
[1:30:02] everybody to see the
[1:30:04] message now everybody's Pentecostal and
[1:30:08] everybody's Church of God and you
[1:30:10] talking about war but my dad could hold
[1:30:12] his
[1:30:14] ground brother Veron I say you could say
[1:30:16] Amen to that my My Little Rooster Daddy
[1:30:24] cocky as he was could hold his
[1:30:26] ground with the message of the hour and
[1:30:28] he knew his Bible and he knew he knew
[1:30:31] how to embarrass them he knew how to
[1:30:34] take the word and just slice right in
[1:30:36] there well my his youngest sister Linda
[1:30:40] is now a Believer his BR his brother
[1:30:43] John is a
[1:30:45] Believer and so he handed a book called
[1:30:48] The Way of a true Prophet to my
[1:30:51] grandmother it's one of the original
[1:30:52] books it's way back in the early 60s he
[1:30:55] handed her a book now my grandmother saw
[1:30:57] Visions don't want to go into all of
[1:30:59] that but she saw visions and she had saw
[1:31:02] a vision of Elijah the prophet and what
[1:31:06] he looked like and when my dad my dad
[1:31:11] handed her the church age book she
[1:31:13] opened the book and there's William
[1:31:15] bram's
[1:31:16] picture she didn't need 10 minutes she
[1:31:19] didn't need two hours she didn't need
[1:31:21] two years to figure it out she said
[1:31:24] Charlie this is
[1:31:29] Elijah brother Ron but I've spent years
[1:31:32] trying to figure this out go to prayer
[1:31:36] and ask God to open your eyes to your
[1:31:40] understanding God to drop the Revelation
[1:31:43] in your heart this isn't by some
[1:31:45] intellectual
[1:31:48] ability blessed are thou Simon barj for
[1:31:51] Flesh and Blood H has not revealed this
[1:31:53] unto you and once God drops in in your
[1:31:56] heart there's not a devil in
[1:31:59] [Applause]
[1:32:11] hell my grandmother became bedfast
[1:32:14] brother Homer actually went and prayed
[1:32:15] with her many times and she was bedfast
[1:32:19] because our family heritage are people
[1:32:22] that have strokes and I'm not claiming
[1:32:25] that but they were people that had
[1:32:27] strokes and she was bedfast 5 years her
[1:32:32] mother was bedfast 10 years her mother
[1:32:36] before that was the same way so my
[1:32:39] grandmother was a person that had to be
[1:32:42] taken care of 24 hours a day and she was
[1:32:45] basically an
[1:32:46] invalet and not a lot of communication
[1:32:49] from her I remember as a little boy we
[1:32:51] would go and sit with her dad had couple
[1:32:53] couple days a week that they would go
[1:32:55] and sit with her my Aunt Linda would
[1:32:57] take care of her and I have a reason for
[1:33:00] this and so but my grandmother would be
[1:33:03] in that state of
[1:33:06] being and even in that state of
[1:33:09] being let's just say when brother Homer
[1:33:11] came in and prayed for a lady's hands on
[1:33:13] her and prayed for you my grandmother
[1:33:17] who was an
[1:33:19] invilet and she was rolled up in a fetal
[1:33:22] position would open up and shout in the
[1:33:26] bed and Shake in the bed and speak in
[1:33:30] tongues in the
[1:33:41] bed some of this is a little bit
[1:33:43] emotional so you just hang with me for a
[1:33:45] moment
[1:34:01] that's some of our
[1:34:03] heritage where we came
[1:34:09] from when I started
[1:34:17] preaching I did
[1:34:20] so and I traveled I traveled the world
[1:34:23] at my
[1:34:25] expense I work three
[1:34:28] jobs I work three jobs so I miss much of
[1:34:32] my
[1:34:34] children the last year that I was an

[1:34:56] heart and many of those places couldn't
[1:34:59] even give me an offering but I was
[1:35:01] thankful I paid for the airplanes I prid
[1:35:04] for the I paid for the and I did so
[1:35:06] working as a chimney
[1:35:11] sweep my father worked with

[1:50:04] me RAB was a seed of
[1:50:08] God but Circumstances had her
[1:50:11] bound but in God's eyes she wasn't going
[1:50:13] to stay a slave to sin
[1:50:29] T Tamar may have dressed the
[1:50:31] Harlot but there was higher
[1:50:35] purpose there was a higher
[1:50:38] purpose that she had in her heart than
[1:50:41] playing the part of a
[1:50:42] harlot she knew that that seed had to
[1:50:46] pass through
[1:50:49] her Sarah needed a name name change and
[1:50:54] God provided for that let me just ask

[1:51:13] hard Peter may have been a naked
[1:51:16] preacher cussing and using a lot of our
[1:51:18] language but God knew I'll have him as a
[1:51:22] speaker
[1:51:23] on the day of
[1:51:25] Pentecost it's not what your vision is
[1:51:28] about
[1:51:29] yourself it's not what your complex is
[1:51:32] is about yourself Timothy it's about
[1:51:36] what God thinks about
[1:51:39] us hallelujah it's about what God thinks
[1:51:43] about us it isn't about what the slave
[1:51:46] belt that the scars that's on your life
[1:51:49] it isn't about none of that
[1:51:53] you and I have trouble seeing ourselves
[1:51:56] seated at a table thousands of miles
[1:52:01] long but that's how God sees

[1:52:08] us that's how God sees us he don't see
[1:52:12] us in our fril stuff
[1:52:17] condition I can't say that strong enough

[1:52:23] s he don't see us in our background
[1:52:40] noise he saw us
[1:52:44] before and he saw us

[1:52:56] this David I think this so
[1:52:58] wonderful I think it's just so wonderful

[1:53:05] line and stand there and they've had a
[1:53:08] condition for 40
[1:53:10] years and they can't even remember what
[1:53:13] caused the
[1:53:14] condition brother brandom standing there
[1:53:17] it's only seconds maybe maybe a couple
[1:53:20] minutes brother Brandon what mind
[1:53:24] reading first of all that patient has to
[1:53:26] remember it to be mind
[1:53:31] reading are you with me it wasn't some
[1:53:34] kind of
[1:53:35] telepathy it was the author of the book
[1:53:38] borrowing a
[1:53:40] body it was I can't say this strong
[1:53:42] enough it was the The Mighty Angel
[1:53:45] borrowing a body
[1:53:53] I I see you get off a school
[1:53:55] bus 40 years ago I see a dog chase you
[1:53:59] down the road it's caused the
[1:54:03] condition now there she's standing she's
[1:54:06] standing there with this condition that
[1:54:08] she's fought for 40
[1:54:11] years

[1:54:49] on that night or in that morning
[1:54:53] and you fall into a Channel of another
[1:54:55] world and you realize it's not a man
