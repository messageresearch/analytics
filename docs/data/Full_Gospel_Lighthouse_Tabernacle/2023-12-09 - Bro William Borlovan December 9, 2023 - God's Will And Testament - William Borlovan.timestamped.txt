[36:17] amen God bless each and every one of you
[36:19] thank you musicians if you will if
[36:20] you'll turn with me to the book of
[36:24] Hebrews and the Book of Luke we'll begin
[36:27] with the Book of Luke
[36:31] first Luke chapter 29 I'm sorry Luke 22:
[36:35] 19 and then down to Hebrews
[36:40] 9 Luke
[36:42] 22:19 and he took bread and gave thanks
[36:46] and break it and gave unto them saying
[36:49] this is my body which is given for you
[36:51] this do in remembrance of me likewise
[36:55] also he took the cup after serer supper
[36:56] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[37:00] my blood which is shed for you in
[37:03] Hebrews chap
[37:05] 9:1 but Christ being come and high
[37:08] priest of good things to come by a
[37:10] greater and more perfect Tabernacle not
[37:12] made with hands that is to say not of
[37:13] this building neither by the blood of
[37:15] bulls of goats and calves but by his own
[37:18] blood he entered into once into the holy
[37:21] Place having obtained Eternal Redemption
[37:24] for us for if the blood of bulls and of
[37:27] goats and the H and the ashes of an
[37:29] hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify
[37:31] to the purifying of the flesh how much
[37:33] more shall the blood of Christ who
[37:36] through the eternal spirit offered
[37:39] himself without spot to God Purge your
[37:41] conscience from dead Works to serve a
[37:43] living God and here's the part I want to
[37:45] emphasize verse 15 and for this cause he
[37:48] is the mediator of the New Testament
[37:52] that by means of death for the
[37:53] Redemption of the
[37:55] transgressions that were under the first
[37:57] testament they which are called might
[38:00] receive the promise of Eternal
[38:03] inheritance for where a testament is
[38:06] there must also of necessity everybody
[38:10] say necessity necess be the death of the
[38:14] testator for a testament is a force
[38:17] after men are dead otherwise it is of no
[38:20] strength at all while the testator
[38:23] liveth whereupon neither the first
[38:25] testament was dedicated ated without
[38:27] blood amen God bless you as you have
[38:29] your seats with the help of the Lord I'd
[38:31] like to speak on God's will and
[38:34] testament I found it kind of fascinating
[38:36] sitting back here you know last weekend
[38:37] brother Ron was kind of making some
[38:39] closing statements kind of getting there
[38:40] at the end and he hit he hit really good
[38:42] on this will and I was like thank you
[38:44] Lord praise God he knows how to speak to
[38:47] you when you're in the right channel
[38:49] amen and see many of these things may be
[38:51] familiar to you we just pray we open up
[38:52] our hearts and like brother Donnie
[38:54] Donnie Reagan has said you know I can
[38:57] always preach from the maps that's
[38:59] always a place you can go amen but the
[39:00] help of the Lord will will speak some
[39:02] things to you that will be a blessing to
[39:03] you
[39:04] amen so Paul here is talking about a
[39:07] last will and a Testament now the Bible
[39:10] in plain language is God's will now the
[39:14] Bible is God's will whenever you look at
[39:16] it as his desire what is God's will for
[39:18] my life right here what is God's will
[39:21] for who I'm supposed to marry right here
[39:23] what's God's will for how I'm supposed
[39:24] to run a family on and on and on it's
[39:25] God's will it's his desire but a deeper
[39:28] understanding that this isn't just God's
[39:30] will is in his desire but it's literally
[39:33] God's will in the form of
[39:36] inheritance everything that you've been
[39:38] promised in this Bible he paid dearly
[39:41] for it and he had to die to enforce it
[39:46] he had to it to to die because the LA
[39:48] what is the last will in Testament a
[39:50] last will and testament in the natural
[39:52] is a legal document that communicates a
[39:54] person's final wishes pertaining to
[39:57] their assets it provides Specific
[40:00] Instructions about what to do with their
[40:03] possessions but God's will is in your
[40:06] inheritance it belongs to you now One
[40:09] requirement as we read for a will to and
[40:11] Naturally Speaking the will cannot go
[40:13] into effect without the person passing
[40:15] but what what what's so different and
[40:17] wonderful about our Lord Jesus Christ he
[40:18] didn't just he wasn't just a martyr to
[40:20] just give his life for a good cause but
[40:22] he said that the because I have I laid
[40:25] down my life and I might take it up
[40:27] again no man taketh it from me but I lay
[40:31] it down myself I have power to lay it
[40:33] down and I have power to take it up
[40:35] again this commandment have I received
[40:38] of my father he had power no man was
[40:41] able to kill Jesus until before his
[40:44] time he had power to take it down and to
[40:47] raise it back up what a statement what a
[40:50] statement but it took the death of Jesus
[40:53] Christ to release the Holy Ghost without
[40:57] the death of our Lord and savior there
[40:58] would be no Holy Ghost it would all been
[41:00] encapsulated in one man the Lord Jesus
[41:03] Christ but it was by because he as the
[41:06] testator was killed and when they stuck
[41:08] that spear water blood and Spirit came
[41:10] forth and that then released the new
[41:13] birth to the
[41:14] Believers it released the elements as it
[41:17] was of the new birth water blood and
[41:19] spirit if Jesus would have went all the
[41:20] way to the cross and he would have
[41:21] healed the sick and he would have
[41:22] cleansed the leper and he would have
[41:24] raised the Widow of na son and all them
[41:26] things but at the
[41:27] cross he would have come off we'd be
[41:30] hopelessly
[41:32] lost we would be hopelessly lost but he
[41:35] sat there until until every prophecy was
[41:38] fulfilled and then these precious words
[41:40] rolled off of his lips it is
[41:43] finished and he bowed his head and he
[41:45] died and at that time he gave his life
[41:48] to make this a reality a reality that
[41:50] the prophets and the sages and great
[41:52] prophets like Elijah you are
[41:54] experiencing a reality that he could not
[41:56] under the blood of bulls and
[41:58] goats you are experiencing a daily
[42:01] overcoming reality that David could not
[42:05] experience what's the difference the
[42:07] testator gave his
[42:10] life and now we have access to the Holy
[42:14] Ghost we have access to what our will
[42:19] isall and we should be just as
[42:21] interested in what God's will says as of
[42:23] what will in the natural would say
[42:27] the real book of the Old Testament if
[42:29] you'll follow me here is actually the
[42:31] book of Acts because you have the
[42:33] gospels and they recorded what Jesus did
[42:35] and there at the end it was after his
[42:36] resurrection but the book of Acts
[42:38] records what the Believers did with this
[42:41] Holy Ghost what do they do with this
[42:43] inheritance what do they do when the
[42:45] word became Quicken you then start
[42:47] reading the book of Acts and you see
[42:48] them like a house like a wild like a
[42:50] wildfire on a windy day the prophet
[42:51] called
[42:52] it why is that because he gave his life
[42:56] life and it enacted and it enforced the
[43:00] word it made the word where you can live
[43:03] it you can live the
[43:06] word in a day and age where PE where
[43:09] where people can't even love their
[43:10] neighbor you are the word made
[43:12] flesh you can live it because you've
[43:14] been called to
[43:16] it because remember no man can come to
[43:19] me except the father draw on so it's not
[43:20] something that we attach ourselves to
[43:23] it's something that he does the calling
[43:27] now God has Eternal Eternal qualities
[43:29] there attributes about himself in in the
[43:31] in the world especially those of
[43:32] atheistic beliefs and things because
[43:34] atheism is a belief they don't admit it
[43:36] but it's something they
[43:38] believe okay they always go to why is
[43:40] there such pain why is there such
[43:42] suffering why this why that they don't
[43:45] understand that God had attributes
[43:47] within
[43:48] himself but they were locked up in one
[43:51] great spirit and he as a father desired
[43:53] to unlock them attributes and make them
[43:55] avail available to you to so that you
[43:59] all those that are sick out so that they
[44:01] and all the prayer requests so that we
[44:03] have all experienced him as a
[44:05] Healer he's a savior and if you haven't
[44:09] experienced him that way then he's here
[44:10] to be experienced that way he's a holy
[44:13] ghost filler and that's how you can know
[44:16] that he rose from the dead is because he
[44:18] gave his life so that you will
[44:21] know and he didn't just give his life
[44:23] for them to make some statue and say
[44:24] that was Jesus he gave his life
[44:26] so he rose from the dead and now he's
[44:28] not only he was with them but now he's
[44:30] in
[44:32] us now if it wasn't for the fall we'd be
[44:35] just like the Angels we'd never sin we'd
[44:38] know nothing of Redemption all we know
[44:40] is one thing
[44:42] worship that's it but God has a
[44:45] different plan for his sons and his
[44:48] daughters the entire gospel you know
[44:50] somebody came and asked Jesus a question
[44:52] one day about what's the great
[44:54] commandment and at all all 10 he said
[44:56] that you should love the Lord thy God
[44:59] with all your heart with all your mind
[45:01] and with all your soul and you should
[45:03] love your neighbor as
[45:05] yourself the entire gospel in this
[45:07] message is built on love if you read the
[45:11] word if you hear the tapes of the
[45:12] Prophet if you hear a true called
[45:14] Minister preach and you're not getting
[45:16] love you you're missing something either
[45:17] they're not preaching it right because
[45:19] the Bible is love God is
[45:21] love and it's all based on love what is
[45:24] this Capstone in the stat of a perfect
[45:26] man what is of
[45:27] all messages this Capstone is actually
[45:31] connected to perfect
[45:33] love God gave the prophet experiences in
[45:36] perfect love that no other messenger or
[45:37] Prophet ever
[45:39] experienced because perfect love brother
[45:41] Ram said is the only thing to enter over
[45:44] there perfect love but he had these
[45:46] attributes in him and these attributes
[45:48] that we experience when we go to bodies
[45:50] that won't get sick when we go to bodies
[45:52] that don't get tired we will be singing
[45:56] his Praises for ceaseless ages to come
[45:59] now God is a family
[46:01] man God has a family and that's why
[46:03] Satan attacks the family have you
[46:05] noticed go Satan hates
[46:07] families because God allowed marriage
[46:11] and he instituted the first marriage
[46:12] between a man and a woman and he
[46:14] instituted the family because it's a
[46:16] reflection of his own family he's a
[46:19] father so we can Now understand him by
[46:22] the natural things that we
[46:24] experience in Ephesians 3:14 for this
[46:27] cause I bow my knees unto the father of
[46:28] our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole
[46:31] family in Heaven and Earth is name now
[46:35] he has sons and daughters and they're
[46:36] literally Brother Ray a part of him that
[46:39] can never be
[46:41] lost his elected bride there's those
[46:44] that are saved and then there's the
[46:47] bride God has a place for them we should
[46:49] never discount somebody that can't see
[46:51] this message but this message is only
[46:53] for the bride the Rapture is only for
[46:55] for the
[46:57] bride in Colossians
[47:00] 1:16 for by him were all things created
[47:04] that are in heaven and that are in Earth
[47:07] visible and invisible whether they be
[47:08] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[47:10] or Powers all things were created by Him
[47:12] and for him now Paul's talking about
[47:14] Jesus here so this right here must be
[47:17] real confusing for the trinitarian idea
[47:20] because Paul was saying that Jesus
[47:21] created all things and he is before all
[47:25] things and by him all things consist so
[47:28] nothing that was made nothing that we
[47:30] see nothing that we feel and handle that
[47:32] was made the Bible says that was not
[47:33] made by
[47:35] him so then how did he make it in the
[47:39] sermon the seed shall not be air with
[47:41] the Shook and I'm going to try and and
[47:43] go slow so we can catch this thought
[47:45] here he said he was God the
[47:48] logos the word that went out of God so
[47:53] you have God the Eternal Spirit he's the
[47:55] self-existent one he's by himself with
[47:57] his
[47:58] attributes he creates the angels and he
[48:00] he creates the seraphim and all these
[48:02] things of Glory but yet you're still in
[48:06] him at that moment you're in him you're
[48:10] in him before the foundation of the
[48:11] world he knows you he knows what age
[48:13] you're coming he knows exactly where
[48:14] you'd be sitting right now at that
[48:16] moment he said the word that went out of
[48:19] God when he begin to brood over the
[48:21] Earth and it brought forth marine life
[48:23] when the spirit of God the logos the
[48:25] word
[48:27] we're going to connect some scriptures
[48:28] here which God said let there be and
[48:31] there went the logos which is the word
[48:33] out from him not a separate person it
[48:35] was a part of him that went out as a
[48:39] Loos and as as a mother would brood over
[48:42] the Earth and begin to create
[48:46] things that was in the beginning you
[48:48] were in him then at that moment he was
[48:51] already slain in the mind of God
[48:54] glory
[48:56] in which when God said let there be
[48:57] there went the logos which is the word
[49:01] because all this was in the logos the
[49:03] whole word the whole word of God the
[49:06] whole Bible for every age was in him but
[49:09] it wasn't expressed in book
[49:11] form it wasn't expressed in pyramid form
[49:15] he was expressing it in Star
[49:17] form that's the first Bible but yet the
[49:20] Stars will agree with the pyramid and
[49:22] the pyramid agrees with this because
[49:24] there are three Bibles not separate
[49:25] versions they're the same
[49:27] version but it took a prophet to come
[49:29] and explain the pyramid it came the
[49:31] prophet of God to come and explain the
[49:33] Stars God had it in a prophet so we
[49:35] could understand
[49:37] this so that word was in him already at
[49:40] the time of creation the whole word of
[49:42] God the whole Bible for every age so
[49:45] that is whenever the bride for every age
[49:47] you're believing this end time message
[49:49] our brothers and sisters that believe
[49:50] the Pentecostal message our brothers and
[49:52] sisters that believed uh Wesley's
[49:54] message and on down they their their
[49:56] belief in the message of their day
[49:58] proved that they were in him before the
[50:00] foundation of the world proved that they
[50:02] were in the mind of God because by
[50:04] believing the word it identified them
[50:09] that they were in him what did the
[50:11] prophet say because in the non-elect
[50:14] there's nothing to
[50:15] Quicken so if there's something to
[50:18] quicken in you sister Anna that means
[50:20] that you had to have been somewhere
[50:21] before you don't remember it just like
[50:24] we don't remember being in our Earthly
[50:26] father but is a DNA test will prove that
[50:28] real fast there's no denying that while
[50:32] our Earthly parents were on the earth
[50:35] decades before we were born we were in
[50:37] them Medical Science proves that so if
[50:40] that happens in the natural why would it
[50:43] not be that way in the
[50:44] spiritual you don't remember it we don't
[50:47] remember it but there's a there's a
[50:48] human Spirit there's a human flesh but
[50:51] somewhere in you that cannot be seen
[50:54] only God can see is a part of God if
[50:57] you're born
[50:59] again and that is why I believ in this
[51:02] message is so easy because you're a part
[51:05] of it you've
[51:06] heard you've been somewhere you you
[51:09] don't identify it you can't say exactly
[51:11] but you
[51:13] know this is real I've heard it
[51:16] somewhere this is this grips me but it
[51:19] may not grip your neighbor it may not
[51:21] grip your
[51:23] sibling but it grips you because the way
[51:27] we come into the Earth naturally is just
[51:29] God's plan should not be overlooked but
[51:32] the real you is coming from
[51:36] God that's why never ever beat yourself
[51:41] up about the background you came
[51:44] from what what what does brother Ron
[51:46] Brother Andrew always preach look
[51:48] forward we don't care about what your
[51:49] past
[51:51] was that though your family history does
[51:53] not matter a single
[51:57] bit how your brother may be and how your
[51:59] sister may be and how your parents will
[52:01] be don't matter we because when you're
[52:03] born again you realize you're from a
[52:05] Heavenly Father you've got a Heavenly
[52:09] parent so it's that deep that calleth to
[52:12] the
[52:14] deep it works differently for different
[52:16] people but for a lot of people they only
[52:18] have to hear it once some more and
[52:19] that's okay God has his way don't feel
[52:22] bad if it took you a long time the main
[52:24] thing is be thankful you heard
[52:26] that's the thing be thankful you
[52:29] heard so then he said as the Loos so you
[52:33] see here you see Jesus in logos he has
[52:37] not taken body of Flesh yet are yall
[52:39] still with me he was still in Loos form
[52:41] we're going to get to John 1 when he
[52:42] said in the beginning was the word we're
[52:45] reading about it right here the word was
[52:47] with God and the Word was God the
[52:49] prophet said that the logos the word
[52:50] went out from God but he did not take
[52:52] flesh
[52:53] yet then in one in St John 1:14 he says
[52:56] that word became flesh and dwelled among
[52:59] us then he could die for
[53:01] you then he could be sick for you then
[53:04] he could bleed for you but at this point
[53:07] he could not but he was creating and he
[53:09] was brooding and and as he brooded you
[53:11] know evolution is is a satanic
[53:14] perversion of God's actual Evolution so
[53:17] to speak when God said let there be
[53:19] that's what it was and every seed brings
[53:20] forth of his kind but he started with a
[53:22] low life and actually built himself up
[53:24] so the Capstone it was of of the Garden
[53:26] of Eden of his creation was man Adam and
[53:29] Eve so Satan attacked that and when he
[53:32] attacked that and that fell that brought
[53:34] everything out it made the fall cuz it
[53:37] was up God created up and when the very
[53:40] top creation fell everything fell
[53:42] underneath it now they're all waiting on
[53:44] us to come to maturity because the Bible
[53:46] said there the Earth is groaning and
[53:48] crying waiting to be go
[53:53] back so he said as the low God Gods
[53:55] begin to breathe upon the Earth there
[53:56] come marine life and building up the
[53:58] bird life up onto animal life and
[54:00] finally there comes something in the
[54:01] representation or looked like the thing
[54:03] that was brewing it brooding over it God
[54:06] a man in the very image of God that man
[54:09] fell like the seed has to fall and then
[54:12] God began to brood over that after the
[54:15] fall so how'd he begin brooding again
[54:18] whenever man sinned how did he begin
[54:21] brooding again because remember he had
[54:22] to bring it back up it fell
[54:25] he brought up a Enoch he brought up an
[54:27] Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought
[54:29] up Prophet after Prophet trying to
[54:31] restore that image again see that
[54:34] perfect couple fell and God would give
[54:36] out his word throughout the Old
[54:37] Testament and Noah came and all these
[54:39] different prophets and it was getting
[54:40] closer and closer and it was building on
[54:42] up building on up and finally he said
[54:44] upon the Earth came the genuine image of
[54:48] God himself which was God the logos made
[54:52] flesh and dwelt Among Us so so God died
[54:56] for
[54:57] you you understand God died for you he
[55:01] took on flesh that Lowa that's why he
[55:04] said I came from God and I go back to
[55:10] God John 1 4 in the be or 1:1 rather
[55:14] excuse me in the beginning was the word
[55:16] so now that you read that with that
[55:18] quote in the back of your mind this
[55:19] should be even more clear to us in the
[55:23] beginning was the word that's when he
[55:24] was broody
[55:25] and the Word was with God and the Word
[55:27] was God same
[55:28] person the same was in the beginning
[55:31] with God all things were made by him and
[55:32] without him was not anything made that
[55:34] was made Paul picks up the same
[55:36] thing he made it all in him was life and
[55:40] the life was the light of men and the
[55:42] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[55:46] and we beheld the glory the glory of the
[55:47] only begotten of the father full of
[55:49] grace and truth and now brother R comes
[55:51] back comes down to you now that same
[55:55] logos has a
[55:57] part he's got a bride and the same logos
[56:00] this word that cannot be tampered with
[56:02] is brooding over the churches today
[56:04] trying to bring the word to its full
[56:09] manifestation that's what the Holy Ghost
[56:11] is doing in this end time because the
[56:13] logos has a part because you were in him
[56:17] as Eve came from Adam we came from
[56:20] him Jesus was a Capstone of the of the
[56:23] Old Testament born in virgin flesh and
[56:26] Jesus Christ is the Capstone of the New
[56:27] Testament in Bride flesh husband wife
[56:31] man
[56:33] woman see how God is brooding and he
[56:35] fixes it just like in the Old Testament
[56:37] he was sitting there and he was brooding
[56:38] and brooding and brought a prophet and
[56:39] brought another prophet and brought
[56:40] another Prophet all of a sudden he steps
[56:43] out in the in the New Testament he has a
[56:45] church and she F fell so what does the
[56:48] Holy Spirit do he Broods he Broods he
[56:50] Broods there was a dark age and the just
[56:52] shall live by faith he's brooding he's
[56:53] brooding and now what do he see you see
[56:55] a full word Bride on the
[56:58] earth with the same works that he
[57:01] had there was a reason why none of the
[57:03] other uh Messengers could have the the
[57:05] ministry brother R had because they were
[57:07] Messengers and not word
[57:12] prophets there's one God and his name is
[57:16] the Lord Jesus
[57:20] Christ one God Amen in Acts 4:12 neither
[57:24] is there salvation and any other for
[57:27] there is none other name under Heaven
[57:29] given among men
[57:31] whereby we must be
[57:34] saved now when a person back to the
[57:36] Natural here when a person writes a will
[57:39] he does it while he's living and the
[57:41] instructions as I said are only carried
[57:43] out when the individual dies and a will
[57:45] has to name an
[57:47] executive he's got a name an overseer
[57:50] and that person is responsible for
[57:53] administering the
[57:55] estate he's to make sure that siblings
[57:57] don't fight he's to make sure that
[57:59] everything is carried out exactly as a
[58:01] testator wanted
[58:03] it the executive is the Holy
[58:07] Ghost it is his job to make sure that
[58:10] the word finds every child of God just
[58:12] like it's the
[58:13] executive's it's the executive's job to
[58:16] make sure no matter how hard and long
[58:18] he's got to search he's got to do
[58:19] everything within his reasonable power
[58:21] to locate the
[58:23] airs and John 16 verse 5 and now I go my
[58:27] way to him that sent me and none of you
[58:29] asketh me whether goest thou but because
[58:32] I have said these things unto you sorrow
[58:33] hath filled your heart nevertheless I
[58:35] tell you the truth it is expedient for
[58:37] you that I go away for if I go not away
[58:40] the
[58:41] comforter will not come unto you but if
[58:44] I depart I will send him unto you in
[58:48] verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of
[58:50] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[58:53] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[58:57] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[58:59] he speak and he will show you things to
[59:03] come and he shall glorify me for he
[59:05] shall receive of mine and shall show it
[59:07] unto you all things that the father hath
[59:09] are mine therefore said I that he shall
[59:11] take of mine and shall show it unto you
[59:16] the job of the Holy Ghost is to reveal
[59:18] this word to you the job of the Holy
[59:20] Ghost is to bring God's children back to
[59:24] him
[59:28] now when the exe Naturally Speaking when
[59:29] the executive you know goes to look and
[59:32] and does everything and come to find out
[59:34] he's a homeless guy sitting on the side
[59:36] of the road he could be the biggest bum
[59:38] in
[59:39] Harrisonburg and he's just sitting there
[59:41] holding a sign been begging for all of
[59:42] his life and just or not for for years
[59:45] should I say but all of a sudden a nice
[59:47] car pulls
[59:49] up and says hey are you so and
[59:52] so and he's probably looking for a hand
[59:54] out when turns out he owns
[59:58] companies one moment changed
[1:00:03] it one
[1:00:05] moment in 1 Corinthians 2:10 and God
[1:00:08] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:00:10] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[1:00:12] the Deep things of God the holy spirit
[1:00:15] is looking for
[1:00:17] you and if you're running if you're
[1:00:19] running from God and you belong to God
[1:00:22] he's not going to quit looking for you
[1:00:24] he's not going to quit calling for
[1:00:26] you no matter what background you've
[1:00:29] come
[1:00:30] from and no matter what it doesn't your
[1:00:33] your past doesn't matter what matters is
[1:00:37] that the the the executor the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] came and knocked on your heart and said
[1:00:43] hey you're not you're not the Son and
[1:00:45] Daughter of so and so you are the Son
[1:00:48] and Daughter of God what is that it's
[1:00:50] the Holy Ghost bringing you back to your
[1:00:54] position
[1:00:57] now we live we live Naturally Speaking
[1:00:59] we live in a very dark time but that
[1:01:00] just makes the lights shine that much
[1:01:03] more now in SE in 2 Thessalonians
[1:01:05] chapter 2 and verse 8 and then shall
[1:01:08] that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord
[1:01:10] shall consume with the spirit of his
[1:01:11] mouth and shall destroy with the
[1:01:13] brightness of his coming even him whose
[1:01:15] coming is after the working of Satan
[1:01:17] with all power in signs and lying
[1:01:20] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[1:01:23] unrighteousness and them that per per is
[1:01:25] because they received not the love of
[1:01:29] the truth that they might be
[1:01:31] saved that's why we have the generation
[1:01:33] we
[1:01:34] have is because they receive not a love
[1:01:37] for the truth and Paul goes on in verse
[1:01:39] 11 and for this cause because they
[1:01:41] receed not a love for the truth God
[1:01:43] shall send them a strong
[1:01:46] delusion that they should believe a
[1:01:50] lie and actually be damned by
[1:01:53] it why all because they would not
[1:01:56] receive a love of the truth why is this
[1:01:58] country in the shape that she's in
[1:01:59] because she received not a love of the
[1:02:01] truth why are churches the shape that
[1:02:04] they're in is because they receive not a
[1:02:05] love for the
[1:02:07] truth you remember whenever Abraham was
[1:02:11] down there out of Sodom and them two
[1:02:13] them Three Angels came down and one
[1:02:14] stayed with Abraham and them two angels
[1:02:16] went down brother Andrew into Sodom and
[1:02:18] Gomorrah to
[1:02:19] see you'll find that when they went
[1:02:22] their preaching did not help them them
[1:02:25] it actually smoked them blind it made
[1:02:27] them even worse
[1:02:29] off and remember it it blinded them and
[1:02:32] they couldn't find the door well who's
[1:02:33] the door the Lord Jesus Christ they
[1:02:37] can't find the door and I want you to
[1:02:40] notice also how aggressive the sodomites
[1:02:43] were do you see that same spirit in
[1:02:46] today they're aggressive with it they
[1:02:48] want to come after our
[1:02:50] kids they want to come after
[1:02:53] everything
[1:02:55] but because they receive not a love for
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:59] truth and they that in verse 12 that
[1:03:01] they all might be damned who believe not
[1:03:03] the truth but had pleasure in
[1:03:05] unrighteousness but we are bound to give
[1:03:08] to give thanks always to God for you
[1:03:09] Brethren beloved of the Lord because God
[1:03:12] hath from the beginning chosen you to
[1:03:16] Salvation through sanctification of the
[1:03:17] spirit and belief of the truth you think
[1:03:19] in this great spiritual famine that
[1:03:21] we're
[1:03:22] in it's so dark remember one of the last
[1:03:25] plagues in Egypt was a darkness that
[1:03:27] could be felt it's so dark if if a
[1:03:29] sincere heart just had a desire for the
[1:03:34] truth where would they find
[1:03:37] it God is the truth but if they don't
[1:03:40] have a heart for Him they're not going
[1:03:41] to find
[1:03:43] it you go and ask you you go in a in in
[1:03:47] a busy place and you ask them if you had
[1:03:50] to if you had to ask if they ever heard
[1:03:52] of William brandom if they ever heard of
[1:03:54] the message of the hour think of what a
[1:03:59] 0.000000% that you would get where
[1:04:00] they've even heard of
[1:04:02] him but especially believe what he said
[1:04:06] and not just preach what he said from
[1:04:07] behind the congre from behind a Pulpit
[1:04:09] and not give the prophet
[1:04:12] credit but to actually have even heard
[1:04:15] of him so think of what an exclusive
[1:04:17] group that you are the fact that you're
[1:04:20] here and you hear the truth we hear the
[1:04:21] truth twice a week we hear the truth on
[1:04:23] tapes during the week and and in
[1:04:25] different
[1:04:26] places you're blessed
[1:04:29] people because the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:31] locating and is trying to find those
[1:04:34] that God had redeemed the ones that were
[1:04:36] in the mind of God before the foundation
[1:04:38] of the world think of the prodal son the
[1:04:40] Bible said that when he came to
[1:04:43] himself he was a son all
[1:04:46] along but there came a point where he
[1:04:48] had got spiritual Amnesia and there came
[1:04:50] a point where he had to come to
[1:04:53] himself
[1:04:55] and go back home even on his worst day
[1:04:58] of sin he was still a
[1:05:00] son I love that go that that God put
[1:05:03] that story in the Bible
[1:05:05] there because when his father seen him
[1:05:08] come and he didn't chastise him he got
[1:05:10] the best
[1:05:12] robe he put a ring on his hand and shoes
[1:05:15] on his feet and killed the fatted
[1:05:18] calf brother R tells a story a very
[1:05:21] powerful parable about an eagle an eagle
[1:05:24] chick that's caught in a barnyard the
[1:05:27] farmer moved it and and we're all very
[1:05:29] familiar with the story and and the E
[1:05:30] and the eaget hatched and it was just a
[1:05:32] strange looking bird but to the
[1:05:34] chickens and it just could not quite be
[1:05:37] satisfied but one day the
[1:05:39] executive came flying
[1:05:42] overhead and when that executive gave
[1:05:46] that eagle
[1:05:48] scream that little eaglet chick looked
[1:05:51] up because it had hurt it it it was born
[1:05:54] in the chicken coop it couldn't identify
[1:05:56] that it hurt it but yet there was a deep
[1:05:58] within that little Eagle chick that
[1:06:01] called out it recognize the chickens
[1:06:03] might not have even lifted their head it
[1:06:05] wasn't a cluck but it was an eagle
[1:06:10] scream when the eagle screams the great
[1:06:13] Papa
[1:06:14] Eagle it gets his it gets his eaglets in
[1:06:20] order we're Children of the king
[1:06:25] everything the father has he gives to
[1:06:27] his
[1:06:29] children the joy that he
[1:06:31] had the peace that he had he now gives
[1:06:34] to
[1:06:38] you you don't have to live with a
[1:06:41] troubled
[1:06:43] mind you don't even have to live with a
[1:06:45] broken
[1:06:47] heart because he is the Healer of the
[1:06:50] broken
[1:06:51] hearts you don't have to live in
[1:06:53] depression and anxiety and all the
[1:06:54] things that Satan tries to put on
[1:06:57] you you think here you
[1:07:01] are if you have the Holy Ghost you are a
[1:07:03] holy ghost filled son and daughter of
[1:07:07] God with more power and authority than
[1:07:10] the angel Gabriel in heaven and Satan
[1:07:12] comes to attack you with
[1:07:16] depression but sometimes we allow
[1:07:18] ourselves we live under our Privileges
[1:07:20] and allow ourselves to be beat up into a
[1:07:22] corner you never seen Jesus apologize to
[1:07:26] the devil you never seen Jesus get put
[1:07:27] in a corner well you're not going to see
[1:07:29] his wife get put in a corner either oh
[1:07:32] he'll come oh he'll attack that's what
[1:07:34] he does but how it just must make him
[1:07:38] gloat to see a child if if no doubt he
[1:07:42] could he would think if they only
[1:07:45] realized but there's got to come a point
[1:07:47] when that spiritual Amnesia drops off of
[1:07:48] your mind and you know that you've
[1:07:51] called Satan has no bound on you Satan
[1:07:54] has no authority over
[1:07:57] you you belong to the Lord Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ the new body that he had belongs
[1:08:03] to you the resurrection he experienced
[1:08:07] it belongs to
[1:08:09] you it's all yours it's in the
[1:08:12] will and if it's in the will he died and
[1:08:16] rose again to make it available to you
[1:08:18] and now he rose again to enforce because
[1:08:20] he's the Holy Ghost
[1:08:21] too so he rose of the dead he's now in
[1:08:24] the form of the Holy Ghost to enforce
[1:08:27] the
[1:08:29] word do you remember whenever I forget
[1:08:32] what that brother's name was but he's
[1:08:33] the one that he had a car and he was
[1:08:35] going to the Tabernacle I think it was
[1:08:36] brother Evans and that Thug or whatever
[1:08:39] came and just stole his car and was
[1:08:40] driving and he came to brother brandham
[1:08:42] and brother Bram said let's
[1:08:44] pray and they prayed and they released
[1:08:46] the Holy Ghost over that
[1:08:48] situation and turns out that man that
[1:08:50] was doing that used to be a Christian
[1:08:54] and the Holy Ghost was able to deal with
[1:08:55] his heart to go bring it
[1:08:58] back release the Holy Ghost over your
[1:09:01] situations release the Holy Ghost over
[1:09:04] your lost loved ones release the Holy
[1:09:07] Ghost over your infirmities it may not
[1:09:09] be instantaneous as as that man was but
[1:09:13] release the Holy Ghost and he will
[1:09:14] enforce the word brother R said it's the
[1:09:17] Holy Spirit today hunting out honest
[1:09:19] hearts that will believe the message
[1:09:22] everything in the Bible that was
[1:09:24] promised is to that believer and when
[1:09:25] you accept it in its fullness and God
[1:09:27] knows that you'll do it he gives you the
[1:09:29] abstract to that and then every promise
[1:09:32] that's made in your possession and the
[1:09:34] Holy Spirit is there to Quicken that to
[1:09:39] you has there ever come a moment in your
[1:09:42] life where you're dealing with stuff
[1:09:44] even if it's in natural and you're like
[1:09:45] wait a minute why am I dealing with
[1:09:48] this I ain't got to deal with
[1:09:51] this well well let that righteous
[1:09:54] indignation kind of come up in your
[1:09:55] spirit too and if Satan's pushing you
[1:09:58] around say wait a minute I'm a son
[1:10:00] adopted son or daughter of God I don't
[1:10:02] have to deal with
[1:10:04] this that's why the new birth is so
[1:10:07] vital because it births us from natural
[1:10:09] sinful Tendencies we're all born with to
[1:10:12] a Heavenly family a New Creation one of
[1:10:15] my favorite scriptures 2 Corinthians
[1:10:17] 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:10:19] he is a new creature old things are
[1:10:22] passed away behold all things are become
[1:10:26] new now there's God has a provided way
[1:10:29] to be an adopted son and daughter of God
[1:10:31] you got to be justified Sanctified
[1:10:32] filled with the Holy
[1:10:37] Ghost but even from a time you didn't
[1:10:39] remember you were still in his
[1:10:42] will when you were crawling around when
[1:10:44] you were an infant you were in his will
[1:10:47] when you were running from God like the
[1:10:49] prodigal you were in his
[1:10:52] will because you always were with him
[1:10:57] your flesh and the spirit have a
[1:10:58] beginning and an end but the part of you
[1:11:00] that actually is went to God that is a
[1:11:02] part of God can no more die than God
[1:11:06] can listen to this he says in the Lamb's
[1:11:09] Book of Life he said now believer have
[1:11:11] you got your joy shoes on listen to this
[1:11:13] if you're a Christian you are truly a
[1:11:16] God child your names are written in the
[1:11:19] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:11:20] foundation of the world oh my the same
[1:11:23] time that Christ that God said Christ
[1:11:27] would be slain he wrote your name with
[1:11:32] his your picture is right next to his in
[1:11:35] the in the family
[1:11:37] album how can he deny you is Jesus's
[1:11:40] name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:11:42] Life absolutely he is the
[1:11:45] lamb and yours is there and the prophet
[1:11:47] is God said that your name is written
[1:11:49] right next to
[1:11:51] his God wrote your name associated with
[1:11:55] his before the foundation of the world
[1:11:57] God's not ashamed of you do you know
[1:12:00] that God is not ashamed of you so we
[1:12:04] should never be ashamed of
[1:12:06] him sisters should never be ashamed of
[1:12:09] how they look and how they dress because
[1:12:11] they do it for him Brothers should never
[1:12:13] be ashamed of how they carry themselves
[1:12:15] and how they act because it's a love
[1:12:18] offering to
[1:12:20] him you think in the gospels there
[1:12:22] whenever the disciples were all coming
[1:12:24] back and they were just so rejoicing and
[1:12:25] so happy that all the Devils were
[1:12:26] subject to their name and all the
[1:12:28] Miracles that they did and Jesus just
[1:12:29] looks at them and he says Rejoice
[1:12:32] not that the spirits are subject to
[1:12:35] you but Rejoice rather Rejoice because
[1:12:39] your names are written in heaven that's
[1:12:42] a real reason to Rejoice if you've never
[1:12:44] you know if you can't put your finger
[1:12:46] back on where you just did something so
[1:12:48] Supernatural or had such a supernatural
[1:12:51] experience as long as you're name is
[1:12:54] written on the Lamb's Book of Life that
[1:12:55] is all that
[1:12:57] matters that is all that matters and and
[1:13:01] you know speaking of subjects being of
[1:13:02] spirits being subject to you don't wait
[1:13:03] for the preacher or for church if you
[1:13:06] are a holy ghost filled son or daughter
[1:13:08] of God you have every right sister Tracy
[1:13:11] and every
[1:13:13] authority to cast that devil and stand
[1:13:15] on his head and to rebuke him you don't
[1:13:18] have to wait you are a son or daughter
[1:13:22] of God it is your
[1:13:25] right we'll pray with you we'll pray for
[1:13:28] you but don't forget the authority than
[1:13:31] adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:34] has the word brother said when he
[1:13:37] talking about John when he was baptized
[1:13:39] in in Jordan the word of God Jesus came
[1:13:42] to him the word always comes to the
[1:13:44] truly Spirit
[1:13:46] fill how many are
[1:13:49] here that weren't raised in the message
[1:13:53] if you could raise your
[1:13:55] hand okay all over the building so what
[1:14:00] brought you
[1:14:01] here the word looked for you found you
[1:14:06] brought you
[1:14:07] here why because of what he just said
[1:14:09] the word always comes to the
[1:14:14] elect always it will find you God will
[1:14:18] not lose a single one of
[1:14:22] you
[1:14:25] now Jesus is not here in his Corporal
[1:14:27] body to do the works but he's here in
[1:14:29] the church by the Holy Ghost to enforce
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:32] word it's the holy ghost that does the
[1:14:34] work he said in force in the restoration
[1:14:37] of the briery have the privilege to
[1:14:39] enforce upon Satan the claims that God
[1:14:42] give us for God has a law and his word
[1:14:44] is Law and God is in is in this word
[1:14:47] made certain claims to the church
[1:14:49] therefore we have a right to force these
[1:14:51] claims upon Satan and say give it back
[1:14:54] back and he has to do it because we can
[1:14:56] take God's agent the Holy Spirit go
[1:14:59] right down on our knees and say it's
[1:15:01] thus sayeth the Lord he's got to give it
[1:15:03] up because the holy spirit is there to
[1:15:06] make him do
[1:15:11] it but the law of the spirit of God is
[1:15:14] to force Satan to give up that which he
[1:15:16] has unrightfully deceitfully taken from
[1:15:19] God Souls of men he took from God Souls
[1:15:22] of women children sick of the body he
[1:15:24] placed upon people where God Made Them
[1:15:26] In His Image to be like him and the
[1:15:28] church is given the rightful legal
[1:15:29] rights by the Bible to take the Holy
[1:15:32] Spirit and enforce this upon him it's
[1:15:35] your
[1:15:38] right brother Gabriel he's not here but
[1:15:40] let me use him as an example he's here
[1:15:42] but he's not sitting
[1:15:44] here if
[1:15:46] Gabriel just
[1:15:48] picked a random house to go
[1:15:51] and kick their door
[1:15:56] in he'd end up on the wrong side of the
[1:15:58] bars wouldn't
[1:16:00] he but yet if he's got the legal right
[1:16:04] and authority to do
[1:16:06] so he not only has the legal right and
[1:16:09] authority to do so but he's then
[1:16:10] equipped to do
[1:16:12] it so we within ourselves can't do
[1:16:16] anything but now that you have been
[1:16:18] equipped by the Holy Ghost you've been
[1:16:20] given legal right to take back what the
[1:16:23] Devil's taken from you if it's your
[1:16:25] health if it's your mind it doesn't
[1:16:27] matter if it's your joy if it's your
[1:16:29] finances you have the god-given right to
[1:16:33] take it back to serve notice on the
[1:16:35] devil here's the notice here's the
[1:16:39] warrant and all of heaven will back you
[1:16:43] up with the badge of the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:46] the warrant of his word we can take
[1:16:49] everything
[1:16:51] back now as I mentioned earlier the love
[1:16:54] of God is a very powerful
[1:16:57] thing it reaches in places and in ways
[1:17:00] that we cannot even begin to
[1:17:04] imagine in Matthew 22:35 then one of
[1:17:07] them which was a lawyer asked him a
[1:17:09] question tempting him and saying Master
[1:17:13] what is the great commandment in the law
[1:17:16] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[1:17:18] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[1:17:21] all thy soul and with all thy mind
[1:17:23] this is the first and great commandment
[1:17:25] and the second is like unto it thou shal
[1:17:28] love thy neighbor as thyself one on
[1:17:30] these two Commandments hang all the law
[1:17:33] and the prophets now Satan is always
[1:17:36] attacking love isn't
[1:17:38] he he'll come up with demonic phrases
[1:17:41] Like Love Is
[1:17:43] Love like all love is the
[1:17:46] same doesn't matter who loves who and
[1:17:49] what what side of the thing Love Is Love
[1:17:52] well know
[1:17:53] there's a Godly love and there's a
[1:17:54] perverted
[1:17:57] love so Satan not only attacks love but
[1:18:01] he'll also attack love to Christians and
[1:18:04] make us feel like we're not
[1:18:06] loved he'll make you feel like your
[1:18:08] brother and your sister don't love you
[1:18:10] he'll try and make you
[1:18:11] feel like God doesn't love
[1:18:14] you and then what he'll do is he'll
[1:18:16] first say well God doesn't love you and
[1:18:18] then he'll start and then if you believe
[1:18:20] it he'll then go to his next phase and
[1:18:22] he'll start breaking it down well that's
[1:18:24] why he ain't answering this prayer
[1:18:26] that's why this is happening that's why
[1:18:27] this is happening and when you listen to
[1:18:29] the devil it breaks down your experience
[1:18:32] it breaks down your faith should I
[1:18:34] say now in St John 17 one of my favorite
[1:18:37] chapters in The Bible Jesus is praying
[1:18:40] and I want you to listen to these words
[1:18:42] in verse 18 he says as thou has sent me
[1:18:44] into the world even so I have sent them
[1:18:47] into the world and for their sakes I
[1:18:49] sanctify myself that they also might be
[1:18:51] Sanctified through the the truth neither
[1:18:54] pray I for these alone but for them also
[1:18:57] which should believe on me through their
[1:18:59] word that's you right here that they all
[1:19:03] may be one as thou father art in me and
[1:19:04] I in thee that they also may be one in
[1:19:07] us that the world may believe that thou
[1:19:09] has sent
[1:19:10] me and the glory which thou gavest me I
[1:19:14] have given them do you see this transfer
[1:19:17] of the will the glory that he
[1:19:21] had and he now he said I give to
[1:19:25] them that they may be one even as we are
[1:19:29] one and I and them and thou and me that
[1:19:33] they may be made perfect in one that the
[1:19:35] world may know that thou has sent me now
[1:19:37] listen to these words and has loved
[1:19:41] them as thou has loved
[1:19:44] me so what am I saying God loves
[1:19:48] you as much as he loves
[1:19:51] himself oh he practices what he preaches
[1:19:54] he said Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:19:56] thyself God loves you as much as he
[1:20:00] loves
[1:20:01] himself and Paul picks it up and says so
[1:20:03] ought men to love their wives as their
[1:20:06] own
[1:20:07] body it's scriptural he that loveth his
[1:20:10] wife loveth himself because she is a
[1:20:13] part of him so when God loves you he's
[1:20:16] loving
[1:20:20] himself in verse 24
[1:20:23] father I will chapter 17 father I will
[1:20:26] that they also whom thou has given me be
[1:20:28] with me where I am that they may behold
[1:20:31] my glory which thou has given me for
[1:20:33] thou lovest me before the foundation of
[1:20:35] the
[1:20:37] world that statement belongs to you too
[1:20:40] he loved you before the foundation of
[1:20:42] the
[1:20:42] world when you wanted nothing to do with
[1:20:44] God he still loved
[1:20:46] you because you were in his
[1:20:49] will and everything he died for belongs
[1:20:52] to you
[1:20:54] amen oh righteous father the world hath
[1:20:58] not known thee but I have known thee and
[1:21:00] these have known that thou has sent me
[1:21:02] and I have declared unto them thy name
[1:21:04] and will declare it that the love
[1:21:05] wherewith thou has loved me may be in
[1:21:08] them and I am them you talk about real
[1:21:12] Oneness here the very love that God has
[1:21:15] for himself the very
[1:21:17] love that God
[1:21:19] expressed in Jesus Christ that's how
[1:21:23] much he loves
[1:21:26] you that's how much he loves
[1:21:29] you now whenever God called Abraham he
[1:21:31] promised him all that land and that land
[1:21:34] was a land of inheritance and it
[1:21:35] belonged to Abraham and to his seed
[1:21:38] remember look northward look Southward
[1:21:41] and that's what the that's what the
[1:21:42] children of Abraham that's what we are
[1:21:43] we the seed of the royal Seed of Abraham
[1:21:45] through Jesus Christ then we should be
[1:21:47] walking through the word and see what we
[1:21:50] own see the promises of God that he he
[1:21:52] has for
[1:21:54] us so Joshua was the one that was
[1:21:57] commissioned by God to divide the land
[1:21:59] amen and St in Joshua 1:6 be strong and
[1:22:02] of a good courage For unto this people
[1:22:04] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[1:22:06] land which I swear unto their fathers to
[1:22:10] give them after all the battles were
[1:22:13] won Joshua by the by by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:16] wisdom was able to divide the land to
[1:22:19] every tribe all the land that they
[1:22:21] conquered now belong to them and it was
[1:22:23] supposed to they were supposed to serve
[1:22:26] God and God would make sure it stayed
[1:22:28] theirs
[1:22:29] forever now we know they sinned and
[1:22:31] backslid but that was God's plan was
[1:22:34] that they were to stay in that
[1:22:37] land Israel was to stay in their
[1:22:40] position and we know that Ephesians
[1:22:42] parallels Joshua and our great Joshua
[1:22:45] the Lord Jesus Christ he conquered death
[1:22:47] hell in the grave and everything under
[1:22:49] it everything that causes death all
[1:22:52] sickness all sin he conquered it
[1:22:55] everything that would send a person to
[1:22:56] hell he conquered it so you don't have
[1:22:58] to
[1:23:00] go but Ephesians parallels Joshua and
[1:23:03] Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory
[1:23:05] of his grace wherein he had made us
[1:23:07] accepted and the Beloved in whom we have
[1:23:09] Redemption through his blood the
[1:23:10] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:23:12] riches of his grace wherein he hath
[1:23:14] abounded toward us in our wisdom and
[1:23:16] Prudence having made known unto us the
[1:23:19] mystery of his will according to his
[1:23:21] good pleasure which Heath purposed in
[1:23:23] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:23:25] fullness of time he might gather
[1:23:28] together in one all things in Christ
[1:23:30] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:23:32] on earth even him in whom also we have
[1:23:35] obtained an
[1:23:37] inheritance in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:40] being
[1:23:41] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:23:44] of him who worketh all things after the
[1:23:47] counsel of his own will as that quote
[1:23:50] that we read earlier when he was
[1:23:52] creating when he was brooding you were
[1:23:53] already in him predestinated in
[1:23:57] him in verse 14 which is the earnest of
[1:24:01] our inheritance until the Redemption of
[1:24:03] the purchased possession unto the praise
[1:24:05] of his glory you know in a natural will
[1:24:08] sometimes people are left something but
[1:24:09] they have to come to a certain age of
[1:24:11] maturity before they're able to get
[1:24:13] that well there's things in this word
[1:24:17] that we've been promised that we're full
[1:24:18] heirs to but we we haven't quite gotten
[1:24:21] there yet
[1:24:23] like the body
[1:24:25] change like the translation it's there
[1:24:28] and it's coming but the bride has got to
[1:24:30] get God is looking the executor is
[1:24:33] looking and when he finds that last one
[1:24:36] then it's time to go
[1:24:40] home then it's time to go home when the
[1:24:43] last son and daughter of God come home
[1:24:45] so some things are left in the will for
[1:24:47] a
[1:24:48] specific
[1:24:50] time speaking of inheritance in the Old
[1:24:54] Testament there was a man in the Old
[1:24:56] Testament his name was
[1:24:58] naboth he lived in the in the Days of
[1:25:01] Elijah and he had a Vineyard and he
[1:25:03] cared for it because that's what God
[1:25:04] commanded them to do they were supposed
[1:25:05] to live in their inheritance they were
[1:25:07] supposed to take care of it God wants
[1:25:08] you to appreciate what he's given
[1:25:10] you spiritual and
[1:25:13] natural and or naboth rather was
[1:25:16] cultivating this Vineyard and he it was
[1:25:19] just a beautiful place so Ahab was the
[1:25:21] Wicked king of
[1:25:22] of of that day he married Jezebel and he
[1:25:25] looks out of his window and he sees
[1:25:27] nebo's Vineyard over there and he begins
[1:25:29] to envy and to covet his
[1:25:32] Vineyard so he approaches naboth and he
[1:25:35] says hey look you know I'd really like
[1:25:36] to really like to have this Vineyard
[1:25:39] I'll pay you for
[1:25:40] it I'll pay you for it in First Kings
[1:25:43] 21:3 and Nebo said to Ahab the Lord
[1:25:47] forbid it me that I should give the
[1:25:50] inheritance of my fathers un unto
[1:25:53] thee now Satan is going to make you some
[1:25:56] offers Satan's going to throw some
[1:25:58] Temptations across your
[1:26:00] path but the Lord forbid
[1:26:03] it that you should give up the
[1:26:05] inheritance of your
[1:26:08] fathers so Ahab comes back home and he's
[1:26:11] all Melancholy and he's all upset and
[1:26:14] pouting and Jezebel walks in she said
[1:26:17] what's the matter and he tells her
[1:26:19] what's going on and she said are you not
[1:26:20] the king of of Samaria and Israel go
[1:26:23] take it I'll I'll take care of it for
[1:26:25] you and so she got some false witnesses
[1:26:28] to to try and and say that uh nabbo
[1:26:31] blaspheme there and had him stoned and
[1:26:33] killed that made
[1:26:35] God very
[1:26:37] angry it made him so angry what Ahab did
[1:26:41] that the Prophet Elijah came out and
[1:26:42] pronounced a curse on both Ahab and on
[1:26:48] Jezebel because the way she forced and
[1:26:51] kill healed righteous
[1:26:54] naboth what did what was ahab's Doom the
[1:26:56] dogs licked his blood Jezebel the dog
[1:26:59] would eat her and that's what
[1:27:03] happened now just because we're Sons and
[1:27:05] Daughters of God and on our way to
[1:27:06] heaven with a new birth does not mean
[1:27:08] there's not
[1:27:10] trials there's many of us missing here
[1:27:13] tonight because of the
[1:27:16] trials but God always makes a way for
[1:27:20] it he always makes a way for it and
[1:27:23] brother R in one
[1:27:25] place he said that he's right behind
[1:27:28] your
[1:27:30] trial and he watches
[1:27:33] us he said that's the power of Faith to
[1:27:36] believe when he as standing over behind
[1:27:39] the Dark Cloud that you can't see with
[1:27:40] your natural eyes but Faith standing by
[1:27:43] you directs you to that God of
[1:27:45] resurrection and a God of all wisdom who
[1:27:48] has ordained our path he's standing just
[1:27:50] behind every every
[1:27:54] trial he's standing just behind brother
[1:27:57] Ron's
[1:27:58] trial he's standing just behind your
[1:28:04] trial an attitude is so
[1:28:08] important our attitude with how we take
[1:28:11] trials when they come are very
[1:28:15] important God wants us to handle it with
[1:28:18] Grace and we have to trust the Lord to
[1:28:20] do that he says oh I love it don't you
[1:28:23] to to know that Peter said that every
[1:28:25] trial is worth more to us than gold for
[1:28:28] it's working every son that cometh to
[1:28:30] God must first be tried score is
[1:28:31] chastened and if you get a little
[1:28:33] heartache after you get born again a
[1:28:35] little trial that upsets you somewhere
[1:28:37] and you run back into the world again it
[1:28:39] shows you wasn't a child to begin with
[1:28:42] he said you become an illegitimate child
[1:28:44] and not a child of God if a man once
[1:28:46] anchors his heart against the heart of
[1:28:49] Calvary all devils in hell will never
[1:28:52] never Shake him no
[1:28:54] more he's there you could be having the
[1:28:58] hardest trial of your life yet that
[1:28:59] doesn't change your position before
[1:29:05] God you're still a son and daughter of
[1:29:10] God then a man that's born again of the
[1:29:12] spirit of God knows exactly where he's
[1:29:14] at that's right nothing phases him
[1:29:17] because something inside of him has
[1:29:19] already witnessed somebody outside the
[1:29:22] Cloud Yonder by faith he sees
[1:29:27] him God gives us as adopted Sons and
[1:29:29] Daughters of God he gives us checkbook
[1:29:32] Authority think about
[1:29:35] that that your prayer can carry more
[1:29:39] weight with him than an angel of
[1:29:45] Heaven if in the natural somebody very
[1:29:49] capable handed you an empty checkbook
[1:29:53] and they signed their name at the bottom
[1:29:54] of every
[1:29:56] check and said here you
[1:29:59] go that'd be a reason to shout wouldn't
[1:30:03] it how much more but see whenever but
[1:30:06] anything you could ever write that check
[1:30:08] for would end in this
[1:30:11] life but yet the checkbook Authority the
[1:30:14] checkbook that God gives you you're
[1:30:17] going to
[1:30:18] Rejoice with your loved ones on the
[1:30:20] other side because some of you have
[1:30:23] written out a check for your prodigal
[1:30:25] some of you have written out a check for
[1:30:26] your parents so the checkbook of Heaven
[1:30:30] is actually benefited from all the way
[1:30:32] on the other
[1:30:33] side it's not just in the
[1:30:39] natural Jesus is
[1:30:41] everything he's our Prophet he's our
[1:30:44] priest and he's our
[1:30:46] King he's all
[1:30:49] three now Earthly Kings they were not
[1:30:51] not allowed to mix
[1:30:54] offices remember when Uzziah when he was
[1:30:56] a king and he was a good King but he got
[1:30:59] he he tried to he tried to push himself
[1:31:01] into the priest's office and got smitten
[1:31:02] with Leprosy remember David went to
[1:31:04] bring the Ark of the Lord and he was
[1:31:05] King but the word was supposed to be
[1:31:07] carried on the shoulders of
[1:31:09] Levites it always causes problems one
[1:31:13] day in Matthew 20 then came to him the
[1:31:16] mother of zebedee's children with her
[1:31:18] sons worshiping him and Desiring a
[1:31:20] certain thing of him and he said unto
[1:31:22] her what wil thou think about this an
[1:31:25] audience with God and he's asking you
[1:31:26] what do you want what would you like for
[1:31:28] me to do for you she said unto him grant
[1:31:31] that these my two sons May sit the one
[1:31:34] on thy right hand and the other on thy
[1:31:35] left in thy kingdom and Jesus answered
[1:31:37] and said ye know not what you ask are ye
[1:31:40] able to drink of the cup that I shall
[1:31:41] drink of and be baptized with the
[1:31:43] baptism that I am baptized with they
[1:31:45] said we are able and he said unto them
[1:31:47] ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be
[1:31:50] baptized with the baptism that that I am
[1:31:52] baptized with but to sit on my right
[1:31:54] hand and on my left is not mine to give
[1:31:56] but it shall be given to them for whom
[1:31:59] it is prepared of my
[1:32:01] father that's your
[1:32:03] place because in the Book of Revelations
[1:32:06] 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant
[1:32:09] to sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:32:12] also overcame overcame and him sit down
[1:32:15] with my father in his throne see he
[1:32:17] overcame brother Donnie and he sat down
[1:32:20] with his father in his throne and now
[1:32:21] he's going to give that same Dominion to
[1:32:24] you because you're in his will You're
[1:32:26] Going To Rule and reign with Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ remember in the beginning Adam
[1:32:32] and Eve were
[1:32:34] co-equal it's the
[1:32:37] fall that put the man in the position of
[1:32:41] headship but that's Godly
[1:32:44] headship not carnal I'm the boss kind of
[1:32:49] we'll put it I'll put it like this as
[1:32:51] it's been said before if a man ever says
[1:32:54] I wear the pants in this
[1:32:56] house there's a good chance he
[1:33:00] doesn't because true
[1:33:04] headship in the right kind of Union the
[1:33:07] wife loves to reverence her husband the
[1:33:11] husband loves to reverence or or loves
[1:33:14] on the wife as Christ does the
[1:33:18] church Jesus doesn't Jesus doesn't beat
[1:33:21] on his
[1:33:22] wife he loves her he nurtures
[1:33:26] her and she loves
[1:33:29] him oh the feeling to see each other is
[1:33:31] most definitely
[1:33:32] mutual we can't wait to see him but he
[1:33:35] can't wait to see you
[1:33:37] either he can't wait no doubt you know I
[1:33:40] can only imagine as he's as he said I've
[1:33:42] gone to prepare a place for you and he
[1:33:45] no doubt must be getting so excited I
[1:33:47] can't
[1:33:48] wait till my family comes home
[1:33:52] and they see everything I've done for
[1:33:55] them it's going to be
[1:33:58] wonderful Revelations 5:9 we'll begin to
[1:34:01] bring this to a close and they sung a
[1:34:03] new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take
[1:34:05] the book and to open the seals thereof
[1:34:07] for thou was slain and has redeemed us
[1:34:09] to to God by thy blood out of every
[1:34:12] Kindred and tongue people and nation and
[1:34:14] has made us see he has made us unto our
[1:34:18] God Kings and Priests amen and we shall
[1:34:23] reign on the
[1:34:27] earth in Revelations 10:8 and when the
[1:34:30] voice which I heard from Heaven spake
[1:34:31] unto me again and said go and take the
[1:34:34] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:34:36] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:34:38] and upon the earth now I want you to
[1:34:40] notice that John here represents the
[1:34:42] bride amen and John was told to go and
[1:34:47] take the book out of the mighty Angel's
[1:34:50] hand
[1:34:52] it wasn't out of the seventh angel
[1:34:55] messenger's
[1:34:56] hand it was the mighty Angel let's read
[1:34:58] it again and the voice which I heard
[1:35:00] from Heaven spake unto me and said go
[1:35:03] and take the little book which is open
[1:35:05] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:35:08] upon the sea and upon the Earth that's
[1:35:11] Jesus
[1:35:13] Christ God opened the book and he sent
[1:35:16] it to the revelations 10:7 Revelations
[1:35:20] 10:1 open the book to Revelations 10:7
[1:35:24] so that we as Revelations 108 can know
[1:35:27] what belongs to
[1:35:29] us it is our
[1:35:32] inheritance no preacher can make you
[1:35:34] believe this
[1:35:36] message brother random the prophet
[1:35:38] messenger himself could not make you
[1:35:40] believe this message if he could he
[1:35:42] would have made all his friends believe
[1:35:43] brother
[1:35:45] Gabriel but he could only be a submitted
[1:35:48] vessel to preach the word that was given
[1:35:51] to him
[1:35:52] and now we stand on this side of the
[1:35:54] open
[1:35:56] book you know it's a blessing to be on
[1:35:58] this side of the
[1:35:59] Cross but think what a special blessing
[1:36:02] it is and what God really thought of you
[1:36:04] to have you live brother Randall on this
[1:36:07] side of the open
[1:36:10] book that we don't have to scratch our
[1:36:12] heads about anything but Christ Jesus
[1:36:15] Christ has completely come and made
[1:36:18] himself
[1:36:20] known
[1:36:22] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:36:24] and forever do we deserve it
[1:36:26] nope we're worthy of
[1:36:31] death but yet God
[1:36:34] came and we were in his mind and he
[1:36:36] wrote our name next to his before the
[1:36:38] foundation of the
[1:36:39] world and he came looking for us when we
[1:36:42] weren't looking for him it doesn't
[1:36:44] matter if you were raised in this
[1:36:45] message in in this church you're he
[1:36:47] still had to come for you in a special
[1:36:49] way you you still had to have your
[1:36:53] moment with
[1:36:56] him there's many people that were raised
[1:36:58] in this message and that are out in the
[1:37:01] world
[1:37:03] today but yet God's grace is kept
[1:37:07] you why because you belong to
[1:37:10] him amen let's stand to our feet the
[1:37:13] musicians will
[1:37:17] come I came across this
[1:37:20] story
[1:37:24] and sister Cassie could you play uh he
[1:37:26] said that I could go free I came across
[1:37:29] this story from the from the prophet and
[1:37:31] it really just spoke to my heart because
[1:37:33] no matter how long you've been a
[1:37:36] Christian we all can identify ourselves
[1:37:39] in this
[1:37:41] story a god of love and a god of
[1:37:45] Mercy that knew us before the foundation
[1:37:47] of the world and when we were yet
[1:37:48] sinners the Bible says Christ died for
[1:37:51] the
[1:37:52] ungodly it's a bit lengthy but I I I
[1:37:55] pray you stay with me
[1:37:56] here he said God's grace is like
[1:38:00] this let me tell you a
[1:38:03] story in ending God's grace is like this
[1:38:07] one time there was a mighty king and
[1:38:09] this mighty king had a son and it was
[1:38:12] his only
[1:38:13] son and one day a murderer killed that
[1:38:16] boy and through that Kingdom went the
[1:38:19] delegates hunting for that murderer they
[1:38:21] finally found that
[1:38:23] murder and when they found him they
[1:38:25] brought him back and imprisoned him and
[1:38:27] when they did a trial was set and a
[1:38:30] sentence was made oh it was a terrible
[1:38:33] thing he had murdered the King's
[1:38:36] son and he knowed what was coming to him
[1:38:39] they put him into inner cells they
[1:38:41] locked the doors they put pads on so no
[1:38:43] one the guards around it cuz we know
[1:38:45] what kind of a horrible punishment this
[1:38:47] boy was going to receive because he
[1:38:49] killed the King's son the Royal King's
[1:38:53] son guards were placed all around the
[1:38:55] doors he was put in Inner Cell stripped
[1:38:58] with nothing but a loin cloth on and
[1:39:00] there he was set in that condition
[1:39:02] starving wouldn't give him nothing to
[1:39:03] eat he was sitting there in that
[1:39:07] condition then they brought him out to a
[1:39:09] trial and he was found guilty and proven
[1:39:13] guilty a sentence was made that he would
[1:39:16] be executed under horrible capital
[1:39:19] punishment and he was to be killed by
[1:39:21] inches until his mortal life was gone
[1:39:24] sentenced by the judge he was ready to
[1:39:26] die and he begged and cried and said
[1:39:28] though I'm guilty though I'm guilty I'm
[1:39:31] sorry that I did it I wish I would have
[1:39:33] never done it I'm sorry I did it in a
[1:39:36] moment in a rage of temper I did it I
[1:39:38] didn't mean it that
[1:39:41] way one day the king went down to the
[1:39:44] place to visit the boy to tell him talk
[1:39:48] to him and tell him about killing his
[1:39:49] own son the only son he had he that had
[1:39:53] killed the boy and he said I'm going to
[1:39:54] go down and talk to
[1:39:56] him and when he went down there he
[1:39:58] looked back in that
[1:39:59] cage like a caged animal he saw his
[1:40:02] little skinny body laying back there in
[1:40:05] a corner crying his face all sunk in his
[1:40:08] jaw sank back his eyes way back matter
[1:40:11] was all in his eyes and his mouth was
[1:40:12] all Whited over no water
[1:40:14] thirsty laying back there on his face
[1:40:17] crying and the King said stand up and he
[1:40:21] come to him and looked at him and he
[1:40:22] said why did you kill my
[1:40:26] son why what did my son do to
[1:40:29] you why did he what did he do to Merit
[1:40:32] such a death as you killed him stabbing
[1:40:35] him with a
[1:40:37] spear he said nothing my Lord not one
[1:40:42] thing just my own impudence impudence
[1:40:46] just my own ways I killed him because I
[1:40:48] was jealous of him I got in a temper fit
[1:40:50] and I killed killed him and said now I'm
[1:40:52] to die under your Justice
[1:40:56] sir I realized that and I deserve to do
[1:41:01] it only thing I'm crying for that I'm
[1:41:04] just sorry that I killed that Royal man
[1:41:07] like
[1:41:08] that Without a
[1:41:13] Cause have you placed yourself in that
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:18] story The King turned on his heels
[1:41:22] and walked out went out to the desk and
[1:41:25] said destroy all the
[1:41:28] records you know on the prophet said put
[1:41:32] them in the sea of
[1:41:35] forgetfulness destroy all the records
[1:41:38] wash them up clean them
[1:41:40] up I'll send down a robe for
[1:41:44] him after a while a great big limousine
[1:41:47] drove up to the door when it did a
[1:41:50] carpet was spread out to the prison
[1:41:53] cell the king stood at the end of the
[1:41:56] limousine said come my
[1:41:59] son and ride home with me to the
[1:42:03] Palace put the king's robe around his
[1:42:06] shoulder he said from henceforth you are
[1:42:09] my
[1:42:11] son because he had pity that's
[1:42:14] Grace that was me that was you we killed
[1:42:19] the Son of God with our sins
[1:42:21] we were alien dirty filthy laying in the
[1:42:24] cells of the world God washed us with
[1:42:27] the blood of his own son and cleansed us
[1:42:31] put on the robe of the Holy
[1:42:35] Spirit now the great Chariot of God will
[1:42:37] back up to the door
[1:42:39] someday and we'll go home to live with
[1:42:43] them all records are
[1:42:45] destroyed and we can't be judged no more
[1:42:50] burn them up up he put them in the sea
[1:42:52] of forgetfulness
[1:42:54] forgiveness and remembers about it no
[1:42:58] more aren't you thankful for that kind
[1:43:00] of
[1:43:02] love Naturally
[1:43:04] Speaking no man can do
[1:43:08] this but God is not man that he should
[1:43:13] lie God is a god of
[1:43:15] love and to think that he would take
[1:43:19] sinners
[1:43:21] from all sorts of
[1:43:23] backgrounds and in a day and age that's
[1:43:25] so
[1:43:26] wicked yet you can live an overcoming
[1:43:31] life you can live a life of
[1:43:35] overcoming and if you
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:39] can't there's been a way made that you
[1:43:42] can no matter how bad or how evil it
[1:43:45] ever gets God will have a bride without
[1:43:48] spot or
[1:43:49] wrinkle
[1:43:51] a blood that can
[1:43:53] cleanse so pure remember the lady makabe
[1:43:57] that nobody wanted to touch her she was
[1:43:58] so
[1:43:59] filthy but yet the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:02] can so cleanse us from sin that he then
[1:44:06] wants to come and live in
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:10] you aren't you thankful for a love of
[1:44:13] the
[1:44:14] father when we were abound in
[1:44:17] Chains chains of unbelief and chains of
[1:44:19] sin
[1:44:21] he came to your cell one
[1:44:24] day your sin killed him and my sin
[1:44:28] killed them so what are we going to
[1:44:32] do that young boy deserved to die and he
[1:44:35] knew it and we know
[1:44:37] it be it there was a king full of love
[1:44:40] Grace and
[1:44:41] compassion that not only forgave him but
[1:44:44] then adopted him and made him his
[1:44:48] son we can never Express that kind of
[1:44:51] love we can just raise our hands and
[1:44:54] praise the Lord and thank the Lord for
[1:44:56] his goodness to thank the Lord that when
[1:44:59] we were unrighteous and even even now in
[1:45:02] our own flesh there's no good
[1:45:04] thing the only good thing about us is
[1:45:07] the part of him and my brother my sister
[1:45:10] if you don't know him in the power of
[1:45:13] his
[1:45:15] resurrection may this be the moment that
[1:45:17] he reveals himself to
[1:45:19] you that you're his son and your
[1:45:23] daughter that he's read to you from your
[1:45:26] from from his will and everything he
[1:45:28] died for belongs to
[1:45:31] you sometimes you got to just open it up
[1:45:34] and show the
[1:45:36] devil sometimes you got to speak it out
[1:45:40] loud and remind the devil that you have
[1:45:43] a confirmation of the commission you
[1:45:45] have the badge you have the authority to
[1:45:49] take what's yours because it's it's in
[1:45:50] the
[1:45:52] will and because you're a son and you're
