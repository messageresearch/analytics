[7:00] [Music]
[7:04] believe together
[7:07] our gracious father as we just come to
[7:09] you Lord
[7:10] and father what a privilege we have as a
[7:13] body of Believers to come to you
[7:15] and father not only just taking
[7:17] advantage of this privilege
[7:20] the father of this sickness is that was
[7:22] made known
[7:23] Lord we know that you're more than able
[7:26] to do what you said you would do
[7:29] and father when we think of our pastor
[7:32] we think of the sacrifice he does when
[7:34] he stands behind his Pulpit Lord
[7:36] and I'm sure Lord there's not one of us
[7:39] out there that can't say it's a miracle
[7:41] when we see it
[7:43] and Lord may we take advantage of the
[7:45] moments may we take advantage of
[7:47] father when you pass by
[7:48] [Music]
[7:50] and Lord if there's one out there that
[7:52] father ain't where they need to be
[7:55] or maybe they're just
[7:57] suffering in their body they didn't even
[7:59] have a request but Lord you know
[8:02] and father maybe there's a sinner
[8:05] lord it's even streaming on the internet
[8:09] father if they would just happen by this
[8:11] way
[8:12] Lord may they just stop father we want
[8:15] you to come by
[8:17] and Lord whatever the need is in this
[8:19] morning just pray father you'll come
[8:21] we sing about it we talk about it but
[8:24] reality is going to be setting in

[1:01:26] last night her boss

[1:01:41] amen
[1:02:07] I had a special visit this morning
[1:02:11] I wasn't going to tell it but I'll tell
[1:02:13] it now
[1:02:16] yeah it was about four o'clock this
[1:02:17] morning for ish
[1:02:20] I went to the washroom and when I came
[1:02:22] back the side of my bed
[1:02:25] I felt somebody there
[1:02:31] and I turned and it was Natalie
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:02:39] I never saw her look that beautiful
[1:02:44] she was so healthy
[1:02:46] her teeth shined white as ivory
[1:02:51] her hair was just so beautiful
[1:02:54] I knew her as a girl
[1:02:57] she was Connie's best friend
[1:03:01] and
[1:03:09] she had the most beautiful gown on I'd
[1:03:11] ever seen
[1:03:15] and uh
[1:03:16] Natalie was a girl that had hair on her
[1:03:19] arms
[1:03:21] as I looked at her arms the hair was
[1:03:23] there and
[1:03:24] she was young
[1:03:27] her hands were just
[1:03:29] so soft
[1:03:34] I'm just going to be honest
[1:03:37] I just told her how sorry I was
[1:03:42] that life had been so rough on her
[1:03:45] and so cruel
[1:03:48] cancer
[1:03:57] she endured a horrible relationship of a
[1:04:00] marriage
[1:04:03] and I just told her I was sorry
[1:04:07] and I told her that I had did my best
[1:04:11] for Connie
[1:04:16] she always had a certain way that she
[1:04:18] said silly
[1:04:21] and she just looked at me and she said
[1:04:23] you're so silly
[1:04:26] because in that Realm
[1:04:28] all those bad relationships and cancer
[1:04:31] didn't mean nothing
[1:04:35] and after a moment she looked over my
[1:04:38] shoulder and saw Connie laying in bed
[1:04:40] asleep
[1:04:41] and she just said she's so beautiful
[1:04:48] now I want you to understand I will
[1:04:50] never come to this pulpit and embellish
[1:04:52] a story
[1:04:54] I'm too close to going to heaven
[1:05:00] and she said I've got to go now
[1:05:05] but I'll see you soon
[1:05:10] what a realm that we live in
[1:05:13] what around
[1:05:16] no I didn't go back to bed
[1:05:20] no I didn't go back to bed
[1:05:23] I was deeply affected by that
[1:05:26] we walk in a mortal realm and an
[1:05:28] Immortal Realm and it's closer than you
[1:05:31] think
[1:05:33] we want to remember brother Bill this
[1:05:35] morning that God would touch him
[1:05:37] and be with him
[1:05:39] brother Marcus back here
[1:05:41] most of you know the story that I met
[1:05:44] brother Marcus on a plane and he didn't
[1:05:46] remember me
[1:05:48] but I met him on a plane over 20 years
[1:05:51] ago
[1:05:52] before I ever came here and I've been
[1:05:53] here 20. 22 23 years now
[1:05:58] and they had a friend with him and his
[1:06:00] friend talked to me the whole flight
[1:06:04] he talked to me the whole flight and
[1:06:05] brother Marcus at the end of it
[1:06:09] his friend asked me what are you doing I
[1:06:12] said well I'm a preacher
[1:06:14] he said what do you preach I said I
[1:06:16] preached the message of William Branham
[1:06:19] now this is important today
[1:06:21] more than ever before
[1:06:24] and Marcus spoke up and he said I was
[1:06:27] raised in the message
[1:06:28] I know all the stories and he just
[1:06:31] clicked a couple stories off so that he
[1:06:33] knew that so that I knew that he knew
[1:06:36] the message
[1:06:38] and he said life
[1:06:44] he said I've made some bad failures
[1:06:48] whether you know it or not I I told that
[1:06:51] story all over the world
[1:06:53] looking for Marcus
[1:06:56] I didn't know him by name I didn't know
[1:06:58] where he lived we was in an airplane
[1:07:01] when we got off the airplane everybody
[1:07:03] goes their separate ways and
[1:07:06] I tell that story looking for him
[1:07:09] we were sitting at the fellowship hall
[1:07:11] having dinner with his family
[1:07:13] and I was sitting beside her brother
[1:07:15] Marcus and the Lord spoke to me and he
[1:07:18] said the man on the airplane is sitting
[1:07:22] beside of you
[1:07:24] you got to learn to trust that voice
[1:07:32] it's not wrong
[1:07:34] and I turned to Marcus and I said we've
[1:07:37] we've met before and he said no we've
[1:07:39] never met before
[1:07:41] I said yeah
[1:07:43] we met on a plane
[1:07:46] and I began to tell him the story and
[1:07:49] I'll never forget the expression
[1:07:51] of hero he would we've come to 20 some
[1:07:54] years full circle
[1:07:57] and God cared so much for him
[1:08:01] that's not what God does he cares so
[1:08:03] much for you
[1:08:07] he said in here in the service now
[1:08:10] and just before service started he gets
[1:08:13] a call from the man's daughter
[1:08:17] he's had a heart attack and died this
[1:08:18] morning
[1:08:25] just think about
[1:08:27] just think about
[1:08:29] I walked in the restroom and I said God
[1:08:32] I don't have words you're going to have
[1:08:34] to help me
[1:08:37] and he just spoke to me and he said
[1:08:40] remind him where he's standing
[1:08:43] when brother Marcus walked into my
[1:08:45] office
[1:08:47] I said I don't have the words to tell
[1:08:49] you but I want to tell you God spoke to
[1:08:52] me and said
[1:08:54] look where you're standing at
[1:08:59] you
[1:09:01] may have had a lot of failures in your
[1:09:03] life
[1:09:06] but look where you're standing right now
[1:09:10] thank you
[1:09:11] Satan may have did everything that he
[1:09:14] can to destroy you
[1:09:16] but look where you're standing right now
[1:09:20] brother Marcus this week got to witness
[1:09:22] to that man
[1:09:25] about his faith
[1:09:28] and that man said I'm going to trust
[1:09:30] your faith
[1:09:32] so this morning we want to remember that
[1:09:35] family
[1:09:37] you know I think of all the things in
[1:09:39] the world there's not enough odds
[1:09:41] to put us all together in this building
[1:09:44] under the circumstances to gather us
[1:09:47] together
[1:09:49] there's another Power
[1:09:54] the mind of God that draws us together
[1:09:57] and puts us in this place
[1:10:00] what he's doing in time is only
[1:10:02] reflecting what he's done in eternity
[1:10:06] and so we we the we count these moments
[1:10:10] of very very precious and so Amen
[1:10:13] brother Marcus please let that family
[1:10:16] know and your family know that we're
[1:10:19] praying amen praying
[1:10:22] let's stand to our feet this morning
[1:10:32] I'm deeply humbled by the video
[1:10:37] it lets us know and I just want to
[1:10:40] to just kind of give you a signpost here
[1:10:44] it lets us know that brother Branham
[1:10:46] said given enough time they'd write a
[1:10:48] book of Acts behind us
[1:10:51] and so we realize when these things are
[1:10:54] coming forward
[1:10:55] we didn't do these things God did it
[1:11:00] and so
[1:11:01] if I can just say this humbly before you
[1:11:03] it's been God every step of the way
[1:11:09] every step of the way and so as I fight
[1:11:12] this dreaded disease I heard last night
[1:11:15] heard it two different ways last night
[1:11:17] that I was going to be free and that I
[1:11:20] was going to walk a thousand a thousand
[1:11:22] years with brother Isaac and and so we
[1:11:25] just are we're just thankful for that
[1:11:27] deeply humbled but it's all God it's all
[1:11:31] God
[1:11:32] so let's pray this morning and
[1:11:36] and I want you to pray for Brother Bill
[1:11:38] and sister Linda brother Randy
[1:11:40] that God would just come on the scene
[1:11:42] for them
[1:11:44] and brother Marcus's friend
[1:11:47] Heavenly Father we bow our heads before
[1:11:49] you now
[1:11:55] there's some events that just take our
[1:11:57] breath
[1:12:01] this day's been already special for me
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:07] Lord Jesus I just ask you that Lord now
[1:12:13] you would come and touch brother Bill
[1:12:15] where he's at
[1:12:17] anoint doctors to help him
[1:12:22] no man knows the day or the hour that
[1:12:24] will leave the Earth
[1:12:26] but I thank God that there's a land
[1:12:28] beyond the river
[1:12:32] this is just a temporary house where we
[1:12:34] live at
[1:12:37] but Jesus you said I go to prepare a
[1:12:40] place for you
[1:12:42] that where I am you may be also
[1:12:46] if I live a hundred years of misery and
[1:12:48] woe
[1:12:49] and I've lived it for Jesus
[1:12:52] and at the end of it I get eternal life
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] these silly things in life
[1:12:59] as Natalie spoke
[1:13:01] don't be silly
[1:13:05] these silly little frustrations that we
[1:13:07] have to deal with
[1:13:09] these light afflictions
[1:13:13] that we have to fight with in this life
[1:13:17] it'll be worth it after all
[1:13:21] Lord I ask you to touch brother Bill and
[1:13:23] sister Linda brother Randy that's
[1:13:26] getting ready to go through his own
[1:13:27] treatment
[1:13:30] Lord you see brother Marcus
[1:13:33] his friend
[1:13:36] no way we can explain in the mind of God
[1:13:39] Marcus sitting in this building now
[1:13:43] 20 some years later
[1:13:47] God you knew where he was at all the
[1:13:49] time
[1:13:50] but he would be sitting in this building
[1:13:52] when he would get the call
[1:13:54] that his friend went home
[1:13:57] now I ask you to comfort that family and
[1:13:59] strengthen them
[1:14:01] now as we turn our heart toward the word
[1:14:05] we too have needs
[1:14:08] I have a need that you would strengthen
[1:14:10] us
[1:14:11] I have a need that you would give us

[1:16:46] amen we want to pray for them today
[1:16:47] they're in a special day as well amen
[1:16:51] I want to read with you Matthew chapter
[1:16:53] 6 and verse 9. and I know this is
[1:16:56] familiar and I know we've already prayed
[1:16:58] but I want us to pray this together this
[1:17:00] morning
[1:17:01] Jesus prayed this
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:05] sorry that we've
[1:17:07] taken a little time to get started but
[1:17:12] but
[1:17:13] we'll get we'll get done
[1:17:16] amen
[1:17:18] after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:17:21] Our Father
[1:17:23] which art in heaven
[1:17:25] Hallowed be thy name
[1:17:28] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:17:31] earth as it is in heaven
[1:17:33] give us this day our daily bread
[1:17:36] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:17:38] our debtors
[1:17:40] and lead us not into temptation but
[1:17:43] Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the
[1:17:46] kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:17:49] forever amen you can be seated
[1:17:55] Once you turn to your neighbor and said
[1:17:56] let's have church
[1:18:19] brother Brandon said this and I think
[1:18:22] this is one of the most powerful
[1:18:24] statements
[1:18:26] he said prayer is the key
[1:18:31] that's the answer you may have a ton of
[1:18:34] questions here this morning
[1:18:37] but prayer is the key
[1:18:41] Prayer Changes Things
[1:18:44] prayer is the most powerful weapon that
[1:18:46] was ever put in the control of human
[1:18:49] beings
[1:18:50] notice these next words
[1:18:53] there's not an atomic bomb
[1:18:56] or a hydrogen bomb
[1:18:59] as powerful as prayer
[1:19:02] prayer will change the mind of God
[1:19:08] I want to just remind you I was with
[1:19:13] brother Doug Baker and he was explaining
[1:19:16] the power
[1:19:17] of an atomic bomb
[1:19:21] it has the power to cover one bomb has
[1:19:25] the power to destroy
[1:19:28] 600 circular miles
[1:19:34] can you imagine the destruction that
[1:19:36] will happen here
[1:19:38] when they're talking about nuclear bombs
[1:19:42] of how that it will
[1:19:44] what they've got at the capacity well
[1:19:47] they don't have nothing
[1:19:50] compared to what the Believers that are
[1:19:53] setting in this building house
[1:19:55] because you have direct communication
[1:19:58] with God that created it all
[1:20:05] in first Chronicles chapter 29 and verse
[1:20:08] 10 wherefore David blessed the Lord
[1:20:11] before all the congregation and David
[1:20:13] blessed
[1:20:15] and David said blessed be thou Lord God
[1:20:18] of Israel Our Father forever and ever
[1:20:22] thine O Lord is the greatness and the
[1:20:26] power and the glory and the Victory and
[1:20:30] the Majesty for all that is in the
[1:20:33] heaven and in the earth is thine
[1:20:37] thine is the kingdom O Lord and thou art
[1:20:41] exalted as head above it I want to
[1:20:46] remind you of who you are you're his
[1:20:49] wife
[1:20:50] you're the Queen of Heaven
[1:20:53] in Psalms 46 and verse 10 says be still
[1:20:56] and know that I am God
[1:20:59] I will be exalted among the Heathen I
[1:21:02] will be exalted in the Earth
[1:21:04] Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 6 but
[1:21:07] without faith it is impossible
[1:21:11] to please him for he that cometh to God
[1:21:14] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:21:18] rewarder of them that diligently
[1:21:22] seek him there's a couple keys that I
[1:21:25] want to drop to you today
[1:21:27] expect God to do
[1:21:30] what he said he would do
[1:21:36] he never tells us to do something
[1:21:40] that he can't back it up
[1:21:44] are you with me now the scripture says
[1:21:46] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:21:49] they shall recover
[1:21:54] these signs shall follow them that
[1:21:58] believe
[1:22:00] in my name and so that's the authority
[1:22:03] that we use
[1:22:06] we have a sworn affidavit with God
[1:22:11] a believer
[1:22:13] is one who acts on the word of God
[1:22:18] can I just drop it to you one more time
[1:22:21] God never tells us to do anything
[1:22:24] that he's not able to back it up
[1:22:29] you see God asked Noah to build an ark
[1:22:34] he asked Noah to build an ark
[1:22:37] and then God flooded the Earth
[1:22:42] Moses stood there and cried and
[1:22:45] stretched his Rod out over the sea and
[1:22:48] God parted the waters
[1:22:52] Joshua marched around the walls of
[1:22:56] Jericho
[1:22:57] and God crushed those walls
[1:23:03] Elijah smote Waters
[1:23:07] Elijah
[1:23:09] smote the waters
[1:23:11] and God separated them
[1:23:15] Elisha threw a stick in the river
[1:23:18] and God made Iron to float
[1:23:22] Naaman dipped seven times in the water
[1:23:26] and God healed him of leprosy
[1:23:32] God just didn't bring you here to
[1:23:35] believe a message we got work to do
[1:23:39] sometimes we feel like we're on the
[1:23:41] defense all the time protecting our
[1:23:44] boundaries but let me just say sometimes
[1:23:46] it's time to turn and go on the offense
[1:23:50] sometimes it's time to put your sword in
[1:23:52] your hand and fight like never before
[1:23:57] he has commissioned us
[1:24:00] for a work God just didn't do bring us
[1:24:03] here just to see if he could do it
[1:24:05] God's got a purpose in every one of your
[1:24:09] life
[1:24:11] Israel sets today as a one of the
[1:24:14] littlest countries in the world but they
[1:24:17] got the greatest military
[1:24:21] it's not up for debate
[1:24:24] they got the greatest science that there
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:27] but they got the greatest god that
[1:24:29] there's ever been
[1:24:31] who has told them I'm on your side
[1:24:35] you're not going to lose I'm on your
[1:24:37] side but I want you to understand
[1:24:38] spiritual Israel sets in this building
[1:24:41] today
[1:24:44] you've got God on your side not some
[1:24:47] stinking rotten president you got God on
[1:24:50] your side and God said I'm going to see
[1:24:53] you through
[1:24:57] we've turned a new year
[1:25:00] maybe you've lost a lot of time focusing
[1:25:03] on somebody else or focusing his own
[1:25:06] personalities or or throwing rocks at
[1:25:08] each other
[1:25:10] maybe you wait being wallowed up and
[1:25:13] self-pity
[1:25:15] wallered up in Poor Pitiful men feeling
[1:25:19] sorry for yourself nobody loves me I
[1:25:22] want you to realize like Sarah set an
[1:25:25] attempt
[1:25:27] she had to realize I'm a part of the
[1:25:30] promise of God
[1:25:32] I can't put myself there but I can
[1:25:35] believe him and take him at his word I
[1:25:38] can't change my body to be able to have
[1:25:40] a child again but God that is talking to
[1:25:43] me he's made a promise with me
[1:25:46] you can't put yourself in the
[1:25:48] resurrection of the Rapture but this
[1:25:50] word will
[1:25:51] [Music]
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:59] we got work to do
[1:26:01] to overcome the darkness that is all
[1:26:04] around us
[1:26:05] darkness that is tried to destroy us
[1:26:08] darkness is trying to defeat us
[1:26:10] you know it's in darkness that people
[1:26:12] get turned around
[1:26:14] they get lost in the woods
[1:26:16] they get lost in the way a lot of
[1:26:19] crickets crawl in darkness
[1:26:22] if you the whole our all of our
[1:26:24] communities change in darkness
[1:26:26] it's the wickedness that comes out at
[1:26:28] night
[1:26:30] you think it looks bad in the day but
[1:26:31] it's the wickedness that comes out at
[1:26:33] night
[1:26:34] but you're in a wicked age
[1:26:37] and God ordained a special bride that
[1:26:41] would live in this age that would
[1:26:43] overcome this age
[1:26:45] God pre-planned us he pre-arranged us
[1:26:48] you heard last night two years before
[1:26:52] that boy died and hit by a by by a car
[1:26:57] and laid there dead two years before God
[1:27:01] pre-arranged
[1:27:03] foreign
[1:27:04] he had a resurrection waiting on them
[1:27:08] let me just say God has pre-arranged you
[1:27:12] he's got a he's got a Rapture he's got a
[1:27:15] body change
[1:27:19] Hallelujah
[1:27:23] we pray not my will
[1:27:26] thy will be done
[1:27:28] I have a I don't know who gave it to me
[1:27:31] and I thank you
[1:27:33] but
[1:27:35] I really don't know
[1:27:36] but anyway I gotta I got a thing that
[1:27:39] hangs on my wall
[1:27:40] God's writing the story
[1:27:43] don't take the pen out of his hand
[1:27:47] I think sometimes we decide oh God now
[1:27:50] everything's going good I can do it
[1:27:53] let me just say this to you you can't
[1:27:55] breathe without God
[1:28:01] so we've turned a year and we can see
[1:28:03] Russia's doing their thing
[1:28:05] the the Pope's doing his thing
[1:28:09] our Nations doing their thing
[1:28:12] they're becoming weaker so they can get
[1:28:16] destroyed
[1:28:20] but the word of God that is speaking to
[1:28:22] you
[1:28:24] is the author of the book
[1:28:27] not just a man
[1:28:29] but he's the author of the book and he's
[1:28:31] placed you in his plan
[1:28:35] you didn't put yourself there shamgar
[1:28:38] didn't put himself there Moses didn't
[1:28:40] put himself there Enoch didn't put
[1:28:43] himself there but God chose them
[1:28:46] to play a specific part in their lives
[1:28:51] and they would live an overcoming life
[1:28:53] that we would know their story even
[1:28:55] today
[1:28:56] throughout the eternities your story
[1:29:00] will be known
[1:29:02] as the people that overcame Lao to sail
[1:29:06] now I want to talk to you get out of
[1:29:09] your pity party
[1:29:12] quit feeling sorry for yourself
[1:29:15] pull your sword
[1:29:17] take the word of God
[1:29:21] let's finish this
[1:29:22] [Applause]
[1:29:34] Hallelujah
[1:29:37] brother Brown said how many times
[1:29:40] as you said in the seat with you
[1:29:44] how many times has he stood with you in
[1:29:46] the hours of your trials
[1:29:49] and troublesome
[1:29:51] and you didn't recognize it
[1:29:56] how many times at the wheel
[1:29:59] when you almost was killed in that
[1:30:02] accident
[1:30:03] or just dodged that accident or
[1:30:05] something
[1:30:07] and you didn't recognize it was him
[1:30:12] how that he was with you when the barrel
[1:30:15] was empty
[1:30:17] and the cruise was dry
[1:30:20] there was nothing for the babies
[1:30:23] and that man came to your door
[1:30:27] and set them groceries down at your door
[1:30:32] that was Christ
[1:30:35] he's alive today
[1:30:38] he's not dead
[1:30:40] but he lives
[1:30:43] excuse me
[1:30:51] brother Shannon and brother
[1:30:54] Greg was in a jeep
[1:30:58] some of you were there at the accident
[1:31:01] they were on their way home
[1:31:03] and to avoid an accident
[1:31:08] they begin to flip went over guard rails
[1:31:12] and I'll be honest with you every time I
[1:31:13] drive by it
[1:31:15] there's no safe place there to land
[1:31:23] when they quit moving
[1:31:29] they just got out
[1:31:33] God
[1:31:34] had just spared their life
[1:31:44] I was thanking God
[1:31:47] for sparing their life and just
[1:31:50] you know we could have had a funeral
[1:31:51] three days later
[1:31:58] I was said into my
[1:32:00] my chair and sister Connie was just
[1:32:02] right over from me
[1:32:06] and I was reading Christ The Mystery of
[1:32:08] God revealed
[1:32:10] and I came across this quote
[1:32:14] and I just sent him the quote brother
[1:32:16] Greg quote and brother Greg brother
[1:32:18] Shannon to quote
[1:32:21] I don't want to read it to you now
[1:32:24] he is the thing
[1:32:26] he was the prophets
[1:32:29] he was in them
[1:32:31] he was in the Psalms
[1:32:33] he was in history
[1:32:35] he's in the things to come he's the same
[1:32:38] yesterday today and forever
[1:32:40] he's Hebrews 13 and 8. if you're writing
[1:32:43] it down you he shouldn't be he said he
[1:32:46] should be the Principal
[1:32:49] if that's what he is and we believe it
[1:32:51] don't we
[1:32:52] then if he is that
[1:32:55] then he should be the Principal theme of
[1:32:59] our talking of our thinking of our
[1:33:02] singing of our walks he should be the
[1:33:05] Principal theme of our life
[1:33:08] and if he's the principal theme of our
[1:33:10] life
[1:33:11] of the Bible and the Bible is in us then
[1:33:15] he should be the Principal thing of
[1:33:18] everything that we do say think should
[1:33:22] be Christ is that right
[1:33:27] and I read that and it just something
[1:33:29] sparked inside of me and I sent that to
[1:33:32] them
[1:33:33] and here's their words back I went back
[1:33:35] and looked this morning their words what
[1:33:37] brother Ron that's the last thing that I
[1:33:41] remember him saying just before the
[1:33:43] crash
[1:33:46] Give the Lord a good hand right there
[1:33:57] now for you that's doing odds on oh it's
[1:34:00] just by chance we have 1100 1200 sermons
[1:34:06] some of those sermons are four hours
[1:34:08] long and God spoke to me that quote
[1:34:13] don't you tell me we're alone
[1:34:16] angels are among us
[1:34:25] now I'm going on the offense
[1:34:27] so I've got to exercise it
[1:34:31] Isaac and Jenny we're in North Carolina
[1:34:35] while I'm preaching speaking on Psalms
[1:34:38] 91 Angels being Among Us the world has
[1:34:42] chaos
[1:34:43] we will too the world has tornadoes we
[1:34:47] will too the world has AK-47s pointed at
[1:34:52] it at 7 11. we will too
[1:34:56] but the difference is
[1:34:59] that we are are protected by the angels
[1:35:02] of God
[1:35:04] at the same time that that is being
[1:35:07] Spoken Here
[1:35:08] four hours down the road Isaac and Judy
[1:35:12] are in a car four boys roll up beside of
[1:35:15] them and roll an AK-47 out on them God
[1:35:19] rich in Mercy
[1:35:25] the difference is the word of God the
[1:35:28] seed of your life
[1:35:31] he is your protector
[1:35:37] I was preaching
[1:35:39] and I don't have a date I tried to find
[1:35:41] one earlier
[1:35:43] I was preaching again on Psalms 91.
[1:35:46] and right in the middle of the sermon I
[1:35:49] stopped and stepped right over there
[1:35:52] and I said I stop now and pronounce
[1:35:56] protection on our police officers
[1:36:01] before 12 o'clock
[1:36:04] brother Justin Klein
[1:36:06] a man rolls out on him and begins to
[1:36:09] shoot point blank
[1:36:13] Point black
[1:36:15] trying to kill him
[1:36:18] shot his car shot a mirror shot
[1:36:21] different things but not one bullet
[1:36:24] touched you
[1:36:25] brother Justin won't you stand right
[1:36:27] there
[1:36:37] so before you consider this fanaticism
[1:36:41] and before you start to start throwing
[1:36:44] your darts at us I want to remind you
[1:36:48] that God who created the heavens and the
[1:36:51] Earth is Among Us
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:37:10] brother Steve Thomas
[1:37:12] drove across railroad tracks
[1:37:15] not seeing
[1:37:17] brother Jeff would you stand in his dead
[1:37:20] not seeing the train coming
[1:37:23] and that train hit him and it actually
[1:37:26] made a tin can out of that that vehicle
[1:37:29] it destroyed it in every way that there
[1:37:32] is
[1:37:33] brother Steve climbed out
[1:37:37] with hardly a scratch
[1:37:41] and had his Bible in his hand
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] and walked over to Sister Mary's house
[1:37:49] and said I've just been hit by a train
[1:37:53] she thought he was crazy
[1:37:55] but the conductor was down there looking
[1:37:58] for the dead body
[1:38:00] but an angel protected him as that thing
[1:38:03] rolled
[1:38:05] don't tell me God's not real
[1:38:18] we hear of stories like Georgia Carter
[1:38:21] laying in the bed over nine years
[1:38:23] hopeless case
[1:38:25] blind the blind man in Bombay the blind
[1:38:29] man in Mexico that dead baby that had
[1:38:31] been dead all day long and the doctors
[1:38:33] told her to go home and bury her body
[1:38:36] and she carried that dead baby to
[1:38:38] service that night made her way through
[1:38:41] all of the men that was trying to keep
[1:38:42] her from getting to where brother random
[1:38:44] was at and brother Brandon had a vision
[1:38:47] and let me just say this you God
[1:38:50] resurrected that baby
[1:38:53] we hear of these stories and maybe we
[1:38:56] let them just roll off we hear Brother
[1:38:58] random said I take every spirit
[1:39:02] in this building under my control I
[1:39:05] remember Sydney Jackson many years in
[1:39:07] Christiansburg said when he did that he
[1:39:10] said all those thousands of people and
[1:39:12] just people moving around makes noise he
[1:39:15] said dogs hushed
[1:39:18] the animals hushed it became a hush over
[1:39:21] that he said that gift
[1:39:24] which was more than a gift was God
[1:39:26] himself that gift had power not only
[1:39:29] over humanity and over spirits but over
[1:39:33] even nature
[1:39:40] let me just say
[1:39:42] brother Branham had to leave the scene
[1:39:45] it broke our hearts
[1:39:48] it shattered us I was at his funeral
[1:39:52] it was a horrible horrible time
[1:39:55] but God didn't leave us
[1:39:59] as a matter of fact the message got
[1:40:00] through
[1:40:02] the message that has been made fun of
[1:40:04] and the message that has went around the
[1:40:06] world
[1:40:07] I've carried it personally across
[1:40:09] borders could have been arrested and
[1:40:11] stayed there for life
[1:40:13] whether it was different places that I
[1:40:15] went carrying back in the day we carried
[1:40:18] tapes we carried all different kinds of
[1:40:21] materials so that people could get the
[1:40:23] message
[1:40:24] let me just say Satan's done everything
[1:40:26] that he can to stop us
[1:40:29] he said everything to try to stop you
[1:40:32] personally Warren in your mind because
[1:40:34] he don't have much time to work he was
[1:40:37] in your mind and worse in your flesh he
[1:40:39] worse in relationships
[1:40:42] you don't have to take a beat and give
[1:40:44] it back to him
[1:40:53] you say brother Ron but you're a good
[1:40:55] one to talk there you have cancer stage
[1:40:57] four don't you realize I I told the I
[1:41:01] told you over and over again I'm not
[1:41:03] going to whine
[1:41:05] I don't care how bad the day is
[1:41:08] I don't care how bad the headache was
[1:41:10] this morning I didn't walk in here and
[1:41:12] give you some pity party we're here to
[1:41:14] fight
[1:41:16] and we will fight until it's done we
[1:41:19] will fight until the rapture
[1:41:34] say my brother on sometimes my mind gets
[1:41:36] to a spot to where the devil talks he's
[1:41:38] talked to every prophet he talked to
[1:41:41] Jesus he's going to talk to you
[1:41:43] so don't go get yourself in some
[1:41:45] perplexity well the devil's talking to
[1:41:47] me well he's supposed to he's good at
[1:41:49] his job
[1:41:51] he's really good at this job but you're
[1:41:53] really good at yours
[1:41:54] [Applause]
[1:41:57] come on I want to talk to you I want to
[1:41:59] preach positive to you you're really
[1:42:00] good at your job
[1:42:02] God bypass millions and chose you
[1:42:05] because he knew you'd be good at your
[1:42:07] job
[1:42:08] Hallelujah he knew that he put something
[1:42:11] down on the inside of you you would not
[1:42:14] quit
[1:42:21] foreign
[1:42:25] sometimes you doubt yourself
[1:42:27] sometimes the devil tells you you're not
[1:42:29] good enough
[1:42:30] nobody loves you
[1:42:34] even you can't understand the trial that
[1:42:36] you're in
[1:42:37] you can't understand the spirit that has
[1:42:40] all sudden come in your home
[1:42:44] you went to bed in a very good mood you
[1:42:46] woke up what happened
[1:42:50] it's a spirit
[1:42:55] what makes young men act like old men
[1:42:58] they're young they got good muscles and
[1:43:01] they go around like they're just sold
[1:43:03] our spirit is God on them
[1:43:05] what it makes people color their hair
[1:43:07] all different kind of colors put things
[1:43:10] all over their body
[1:43:12] a spirit got on them
[1:43:18] what can make a person that is so great
[1:43:21] and has such a wonderful personality all
[1:43:24] of a sudden pull a gun
[1:43:27] a spirit gets on them there's a lot of
[1:43:30] prisoners set in prison today that were
[1:43:33] great people good citizens and just
[1:43:35] something clicked on the inside of them
[1:43:39] I'm not making an excuse for none of
[1:43:41] them
[1:43:45] but there is a fix
[1:43:54] you're having marriage trouble
[1:43:55] there's a fix
[1:43:59] there's a fix for you
[1:44:03] you're having job trouble there's a fix
[1:44:06] for you
[1:44:07] you put God first in everything in your
[1:44:09] home
[1:44:11] in your job
[1:44:13] in your life you get yourself in
[1:44:16] position to be blessed
[1:44:22] quit whining about what you ain't got
[1:44:24] and start thanking God for what you do
[1:44:27] have
[1:44:29] thank you
[1:44:32] come on Church
[1:44:43] buddies of buddies
[1:44:45] friends are friends
[1:44:48] jobs are jobs
[1:44:50] but God gave you a queen and gave you a
[1:44:52] king
[1:44:56] spend time with them
[1:44:59] amen oh my brother Ron you know we
[1:45:03] well you can go listen to brother Tim
[1:45:04] the other day I I said it too
[1:45:07] all of a sudden we get old we don't
[1:45:09] sleep in the same room no more
[1:45:12] we sat at a table and we text one
[1:45:15] another
[1:45:17] of getting up at 5 30 6 o'clock in the
[1:45:20] morning to take me to UVA
[1:45:24] my words are I never want to be a burden
[1:45:26] on you
[1:45:27] and she will quickly rebuke me
[1:45:30] I married you for better for worse
[1:45:34] it's not just you it's us
[1:45:39] but too many times people become selfish
[1:45:44] now I'm linking this both ways now
[1:45:47] don't think I'm just talking about your
[1:45:48] marriage I'm talking about God
[1:45:52] when you when you stop praising the Lord
[1:45:54] when you stop thanking him
[1:46:00] now let me preach to you just a little
[1:46:02] bit
[1:46:11] the Lord I'm not going to wait till I'm
[1:46:14] in some bed somewhere or another and
[1:46:16] wish that I would have did it
[1:46:20] don't tell me about your pity party how
[1:46:23] bad you got it
[1:46:25] why you got breath in your lungs why you
[1:46:28] got strength to wiggle your finger this
[1:46:31] is your time
[1:46:38] thank you
[1:46:58] Lord
[1:47:02] the reason people can't shake themselves
[1:47:04] because they're backslid
[1:47:10] and in the backslidden state you've lost
[1:47:12] your prayer
[1:47:14] you lost your desire to read your Bible
[1:47:18] and actually you can come and occupy a
[1:47:20] pew
[1:47:22] and the service doesn't even affect you
[1:47:28] too hot too cold somebody got my seat
[1:47:33] instead of being thankful that every
[1:47:36] soul brings us closer to rapture
[1:47:38] you're concerned somebody took your seat
[1:47:42] get over yourself
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:48:02] the scripture says if I'm okay
[1:48:09] if you abide in me in my words
[1:48:13] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[1:48:17] and itself this is a positive scripture
[1:48:22] too many times
[1:48:25] we just expect God to read our mind
[1:48:29] well I was praising the Lord
[1:48:37] people are in Revival
[1:48:40] and you're missing the point
[1:48:43] people said in brother brand was meeting
[1:48:45] side by side best friends one caught
[1:48:49] that that was Elijah and God was moving
[1:48:51] and God was going to have a bride the
[1:48:53] the fellow sitting right beside of him
[1:48:55] missed it
[1:48:58] just absolutely missed it didn't see
[1:49:00] nothing
[1:49:01] seed has a whole lot to do with that
[1:49:04] but neither do I want to come to service
[1:49:08] and Miss what God's doing in this day
[1:49:12] I don't want to sit here 40 years
[1:49:16] and feel like some entitled privileged
[1:49:19] child
[1:49:22] it's not what we used to do it's what
[1:49:25] you're doing now
[1:49:33] well brother Ron I'm old I'm gray-headed
[1:49:35] you're more dangerous
[1:49:37] than you were when you were young
[1:49:40] you have forgot something you still can
[1:49:44] pray
[1:49:47] amen I tried
[1:49:51] brother Meadows probably here don't
[1:49:53] remember what he had for breakfast
[1:49:54] yesterday
[1:49:56] but he's probably the best day manner we
[1:49:58] have in this building
[1:49:59] [Applause]
[1:50:02] give him a good hand
[1:50:12] brother Brown said now try hard
[1:50:14] Christians to understand that this day
[1:50:17] that the message has been placed in The
[1:50:19] Believer positionally if every believer
[1:50:22] in here was in the right place
[1:50:25] I'm so thankful where there was a whole
[1:50:28] row of wheelchair set there's only about
[1:50:30] two or three left in here
[1:50:32] if every believer knew their place
[1:50:35] a lady on a Cod a man on crutches along
[1:50:38] there that would be not one feeble
[1:50:40] person in the building in the next 20
[1:50:43] minutes
[1:50:44] that's what kind of people that you are
[1:50:52] if every person if every man could only
[1:50:55] find simply find his place his or her
[1:50:59] in Christ Jesus
[1:51:01] what a difference
[1:51:04] it would make
[1:51:06] we were speaking a meeting in South
[1:51:08] Carolina
[1:51:10] large meeting probably about 1100 people
[1:51:13] that was there
[1:51:16] as I was preaching
[1:51:18] there was a man on crutches
[1:51:22] and he began to make his way
[1:51:26] and he could only take maybe one step at
[1:51:28] a time and he was making his way he was
[1:51:30] in the back of the building and he was
[1:51:31] making his way and it was just coming
[1:51:35] wasn't waiting on the prayer line wasn't
[1:51:37] waiting on an altar call wasn't waiting
[1:51:38] on laying hands on the sick he just was
[1:51:41] coming
[1:51:42] when he got right near the front he just
[1:51:44] throwed his scratches down and danced
[1:51:46] all the way back
[1:51:56] what about the blind eyes that have been
[1:51:58] opened
[1:52:00] what about the deaf ears that begin to
[1:52:02] heal
[1:52:03] what about the baby that was getting
[1:52:05] ready to be taken from the little
[1:52:07] mother's womb dead on Tuesday morning
[1:52:10] and that day they found heartbeat and
[1:52:12] they had a healthy baby
[1:52:15] I prayed this morning may God take these
[1:52:18] Barren wounds and put life on the inside
[1:52:21] of them
[1:52:23] why should we doubt why should we fail
[1:52:29] the scripture says them and you say well
[1:52:31] brother Ryan one day one day God will do
[1:52:33] that well I want to give you a scripture
[1:52:35] beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:52:39] and at death not yet appear what we
[1:52:41] shall be but we know that when he shall
[1:52:45] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[1:52:49] see him as he is that's not good enough
[1:52:51] for you let me give you another year of
[1:52:54] God little children
[1:52:55] and have overcame them because greater
[1:52:58] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:53:01] the world say that with me greater is he
[1:53:04] that is in you
[1:53:09] Jehovah Jireh brother Brown says just
[1:53:12] recently a colored man
[1:53:14] in Shreveport stood up and said there's
[1:53:17] no such thing as God
[1:53:20] he's just blasphemed they're they're
[1:53:23] nothing but a bunch of Holy Rollers
[1:53:27] lightning killed him
[1:53:30] they took him to the Grave
[1:53:33] and when they was burying that man
[1:53:37] there come up a little cloud and
[1:53:39] lightning struck that casket and blowed
[1:53:42] him Plum out of the casket
[1:53:45] Jehovah God gets angry
[1:53:49] and I know he's a good God
[1:53:52] but he is a god of judgment too
[1:53:56] Hallelujah
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:00] Jeremiah 33 or I'm getting warmed up I
[1:54:03] think I'm getting it somewhere Jeremiah

[1:54:07] answer thee and show thee Great and
[1:54:10] Mighty things

[1:54:17] words yes you've heard it before and and
[1:54:19] my words abide in you you shall ask
[1:54:23] what you will and it shall be done unto
[1:54:27] you
[1:54:28] reading it again God don't necessarily
[1:54:31] need to read your mind he needs to hear
[1:54:34] you pray
[1:54:37] amen a lot of times we have not because
[1:54:42] we ask not
[1:54:46] my children sitting at the table
[1:54:53] they didn't just set their mom
[1:54:58] whenever it come time to eat
[1:55:01] they dug in
[1:55:04] and they ate now we did not feed Matthew
[1:55:07] more than we fed Andrew
[1:55:11] foreign
[1:55:16] but his DNA
[1:55:18] while he ate made him what he was
[1:55:24] I'm going somewhere with that all you
[1:55:26] got to do is come in this place and eat
[1:55:38] don't sit there and go well I don't like
[1:55:39] that and I don't like that and I don't

[1:56:06] diet I'm gonna die I'm not before nobody
[1:56:08] up let me just say this you your body
[1:56:10] tells us
[1:56:11] you have not been chasing green peas all
[1:56:14] over the plate
[1:56:16] [Applause]
[1:56:22] and as a pastor I can recognize whether
[1:56:25] you're in Revival or whether you've been
[1:56:27] lazy in prayer and you're backslidden in
[1:56:30] your spirit
[1:56:31] I can tell by your walk you've been
[1:56:34] talking to the Lord I can tell by your
[1:56:37] talk you've been talking to the Lord
[1:56:43] [Applause]
[1:56:56] Hallelujah you give me a permission and
[1:56:58] here we are Joshua 23 and verse 10 this
[1:57:02] was scripture and it was prophecy one
[1:57:05] man of you shall chase a thousand
[1:57:07] for the Lord your God he is it that
[1:57:10] fighteth for you
[1:57:12] as he hath promised you as long as that
[1:57:17] was just a scripture or a sermon he just
[1:57:20] laid their dormant didn't do you no good
[1:57:22] but shamgar one day remembered that
[1:57:25] promise
[1:57:27] and the devil can't count he sent 600
[1:57:31] people to his house
[1:57:33] and shamgar picked up a stick six foot
[1:57:37] sticks he was not a he was not a warrior
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] but God was on his side
[1:57:47] and let me just tell you he didn't kill
[1:57:49] all 600 at one time
[1:57:52] one
[1:57:54] two
[1:57:55] three you know after you get the ten you
[1:57:58] get good at it

[1:58:04] saying God use me God speak to me God
[1:58:08] anoint me before long you'll get good at
[1:58:11] it
[1:58:14] and We Know shamgar by name
[1:58:18] because he took a scripture and made it
[1:58:21] live
[1:58:27] the church asked the authority in Jesus
[1:58:29] name
[1:58:31] in my name shall you cast out devils
[1:58:34] speak in new tongues
[1:58:36] and if they take up serpents or drink
[1:58:38] any deadly thing
[1:58:41] it'll not harm them
[1:58:44] they lay hands on the on the sick
[1:58:47] they shall recover

[2:02:05] because you've got the equipment to do
[2:02:07] something with him
[2:02:13] I'd say in hell they remember David
[2:02:15] really well
[2:02:18] you know they scarred him those demons
[2:02:20] scarred him with adultery
[2:02:22] murder of a best friend
[2:02:24] they scarred him with all kind of
[2:02:26] decisions that he made wrong
[2:02:28] but the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:32] said I'll not only love David
[2:02:35] but I'm going to name my Throne after
[2:02:38] him
[2:02:43] now can you imagine
[2:02:47] in hell
[2:02:51] how they talk about our prophet
[2:02:57] they did their best to destroy him
[2:03:00] they did their absolute best to destroy
[2:03:03] actually brother Branham tried his best
[2:03:05] to destroy himself
[2:03:06] but God that was rich in Mercy
[2:03:11] he was rich in Mercy
[2:03:13] and you know I'm always astounded I've
[2:03:15] been a I've been a listener to tapes
[2:03:17] since since a little boy
[2:03:20] no matter where brother Brandon was at
[2:03:22] he's not really intimidated by the
[2:03:25] audience
[2:03:26] whether it's Switzerland or in Finland
[2:03:28] or even in some of those Nations over
[2:03:31] there they may not know his language or
[2:03:33] his dialect and he'll tell them a
[2:03:35] squirrel story
[2:03:37] and they'll relate
[2:03:41] I tell them about a possum and they'll
[2:03:43] relate
[2:03:44] for long he starts telling him the one
[2:03:46] Miracle after another miracle and Jesus
[2:03:48] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[2:03:50] forever if he ever did heal he's still
[2:03:52] obligated to heal you and before long he
[2:03:55] takes some historical events and makes
[2:03:58] them modern right in the service
[2:04:02] now you may have walked into this
[2:04:04] morning with your back condition
[2:04:08] and your back just feels like it's going
[2:04:10] to give out at any time
[2:04:13] and no doubt if you went to a back
[2:04:16] doctor you would set hours and hours and
[2:04:18] hours and then they do surgery and it'd
[2:04:20] take you six months to get fixed when
[2:04:23] you walked into the right doctor today
[2:04:28] and in a moment he can fix your back
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:34] all right
[2:04:36] in a moment he can fix your marriage in
[2:04:40] a moment he can bless your business in a
[2:04:43] moment
[2:05:00] I want to make a couple more statements
[2:05:03] the word of God
[2:05:05] is superior
[2:05:07] to your feelings
[2:05:10] I want you to quote it with me the word
[2:05:12] of God is superior
[2:05:16] to your feelings
[2:05:21] ain't that great
[2:05:23] ain't that great
[2:05:29] Brother Band says
[2:05:32] Satan took him up on the mountain and
[2:05:34] set him down
[2:05:36] and Jesus rebuked him again with the
[2:05:39] word
[2:05:40] he defeated Satan with the word of God
[2:05:42] showing that the weakest of Christians
[2:05:44] can defeat
[2:05:46] Satan with the word of God
[2:05:49] showing that the weakest of Christians
[2:05:52] maybe you walked in this building in a
[2:05:54] very much of a blues
[2:05:58] dark situation you don't have to stay
[2:06:00] that way
[2:06:03] you don't have to stay that way
[2:06:06] the weakest of Christians
[2:06:10] can defeat Satan with thus saith the
[2:06:15] Lord
[2:06:20] well brother Ron
[2:06:23] my wife's got a devil on her
[2:06:28] well you know you could lay hands on her
[2:06:30] and throw in the floor
[2:06:33] pray for her for
[2:06:35] 52 hours
[2:06:40] but brother Branham was his remedy for
[2:06:42] that was go go buy a box of chocolates
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:48] and a dozen of roses
[2:06:50] now let me say them sisters don't blame
[2:06:52] me
[2:06:53] if you get a box of chocolates and a
[2:06:55] Dozen Roses this week
[2:06:59] don't you think oh my husband thinks I
[2:07:01] got a demon on me
[2:07:04] enjoy the roses and eat the chocolate
[2:07:07] [Applause]
[2:07:20] I read this to you three years ago
[2:07:24] be still and know that I'm God
[2:07:27] I'm bigger than your problem
[2:07:29] I'm bigger than your circumstance
[2:07:32] I'm bigger than your situation
[2:07:36] this is not your battle
[2:07:39] you don't have to handle this this is
[2:07:41] God's battle
[2:07:43] God will work it out
[2:07:46] all you have to do is be still and know
[2:07:49] that I am god let's stand
[2:07:53] Give the Lord a good hand this morning
[2:08:08] can I give you one more quote brother
[2:08:09] bam said Jesus never cried when they
[2:08:11] brought that maniac
[2:08:13] boy to him that had leprosy fallen in
[2:08:16] the fire he never said father I'm your
[2:08:19] son now now you sent me here to do such
[2:08:21] and so and so and so can I heal this boy
[2:08:23] he never said that
[2:08:25] he said come out of him Satan
[2:08:27] he spoke and the boy was well
[2:08:33] when he met Legion with two thousand
[2:08:35] devils in him
[2:08:37] it wasn't Jesus a crime it was those
[2:08:40] Devils a crime
[2:08:42] how much Authority do we have at our
[2:08:45] disposal here
[2:08:46] I want to ask you do we realize what
[2:08:50] kind of authority that we have
[2:08:55] Jesus never said no father
[2:08:58] am I able to do this
[2:09:01] he said come out of him
[2:09:03] and the Devils took their flight
[2:09:07] he knowed he was the Messiah
[2:09:11] and here's what I want to drop to you
[2:09:12] when you know who you are
[2:09:18] when you know who you are
[2:09:23] it's greater than every devil in hell
[2:09:27] when you know who you are
[2:09:29] now I know I'm coming down to an end and
[2:09:32] it's kind of quiet but I want to say
[2:09:34] something to you you don't have to fear
[2:09:36] cancer
[2:09:41] you don't have to fear trouble on your
[2:09:43] job
[2:09:44] because the scripture said he'd make you
[2:09:46] the head and not the tail
[2:09:49] God said he'd bless you coming in and
[2:09:52] going out
[2:09:57] this ain't a Prosperity Gospel this is a
[2:09:59] power gospel
[2:10:01] this is an authority gospel
[2:10:04] you are the Queen of Heaven
[2:10:07] you will sit on the throne with him you
[2:10:10] will March up and down the streets of
[2:10:11] gold

[2:10:22] no more sorrow
[2:10:24] no more pain
[2:10:26] no more Timex
[2:10:30] no more getting hungry during service
[2:10:39] sometimes we leave service
[2:10:41] and we dread going back to work on
[2:10:43] Monday morning after the atmosphere that
[2:10:46] we've been in
[2:10:48] after the atmosphere that we've been in
[2:10:50] but let me just say you don't have to
[2:10:52] leave it here
[2:10:57] you don't have to leave it here

[2:11:41] car
[2:11:42] he can I want him everywhere that I go
[2:11:46] [Applause]
[2:12:01] it was a man came to Jesus
[2:12:04] and he said I'm a man
[2:12:06] with authority
[2:12:09] I know you're busy I'm paraphrasing I
[2:12:11] know you're busy
[2:12:12] doing what you're doing
[2:12:15] if you'll just send the word
[2:12:18] my servant will be well
[2:12:21] you don't have to come to my house you
[2:12:22] don't have to
[2:12:24] and Jesus recognized that this man
[2:12:26] understood Authority
[2:12:30] if I could only persuade you this this
[2:12:33] morning drop this Revelation in your
[2:12:35] heart if you could only understand
[2:12:36] what's at your disposal
[2:12:42] you heard last night
[2:12:44] two people speak in tongues
[2:12:48] if you noticed it was the exact same
[2:12:50] Cadence
[2:12:53] one right after the other
[2:12:56] listen these things are not happening by
[2:12:58] chance
[2:13:01] and he said well God's in our church
[2:13:03] God's in your home
[2:13:08] God's going with your children to school
[2:13:13] God's in your marriage
[2:13:17] Authority is more than just saying you
[2:13:20] got it
[2:13:22] you got to exercise it
[2:13:24] and so when the wrong kind of thoughts
[2:13:26] come in your mind
[2:13:28] tell the devil take leave
[2:13:33] take leave
[2:13:35] now I want you to exercise that right

[2:13:39] your lead
