[16:33] brother Ron would just come and pray
[16:35] over these needs this evening if you
[16:36] would
[16:38] [Music]
[16:47] forward scans went really good this week
[17:01] so we've got a good heart and all of
[17:03] that's working well it became of the
[17:05] reason they do that is the chemo is
[17:06] really hard on the heart and so we we
[17:09] got good scans and then we had a brain
[17:12] scans this week and the doctor's really
[17:14] happy about that
[17:15] we still have two tumors there but it's
[17:18] not spreading and
[17:20] he just he actually just told the other
[17:22] doctor that was in the room with him and
[17:24] said we're family here he said this this
[17:27] is my favorite patient so God's give us
[17:30] good doctors and and we care for them
[17:33] and
[17:34] amen we just know that God's a he's a
[17:36] Healer
[17:37] Amen to give you an idea of why that is
[17:41] so incredible
[17:43] if they would start to spread in 30 days
[17:46] I would have about three weeks to live
[17:48] and so when you get a stable
[17:51] you know when we get a stable report
[17:54] you're really happy to get that stable
[17:57] reporting
[18:07] amen I got a call from sister Sue today
[18:12] sister Sue
[18:13] she she didn't want nobody to know she's
[18:16] kind of secret like secretive like a lot
[18:19] of you here
[18:20] she didn't want nobody to know that she
[18:22] had had hip replacement on Monday
[18:25] she was wanting to leave the hospital
[18:27] that evening
[18:28] but she wasn't able to walk until today
[18:32] because of extreme pain
[18:35] and I don't know you're suffering with
[18:37] sciatica
[18:38] they actually burned that nerve this
[18:41] week and so
[18:45] it's a she has a real need that God
[18:48] would touch her and she wasn't able to
[18:51] sit up until today
[18:53] and they're wanting her to go to rehab
[18:57] and you know for her I'm sure that
[19:01] that's about like me going to the
[19:03] dentist
[19:04] and she wants to go home she wants to go
[19:07] back to work uh she's a pusher that's
[19:11] not that's not her style
[19:14] but when she called me today and said I
[19:16] want you to pray and I want you to take
[19:17] this before the church I said sister to
[19:20] Sue I will do that for you and and so I
[19:24] believe that God hears and answers
[19:26] prayer and she's been faithful to God
[19:29] for all these years
[19:31] and you know we don't see some of these
[19:33] things happening some of the doctors
[19:35] don't see it happening they just expect
[19:37] it to be just a common surgery but
[19:40] sometimes they touch things that
[19:42] shouldn't be touched and so I know a God
[19:45] that's a nerve healer
[19:48] I know that God and
[19:50] and he's a God that hears and answers
[19:52] prayer amen maybe you're standing beside
[19:55] your wife or or a sister and a sister
[19:58] brother to brother maybe just take them
[20:00] by the hand
[20:01] threefold cord is
[20:03] more powerful than a single chord we
[20:06] stand here together and every one of
[20:08] these needs are important I hear my name
[20:11] called here every weekend I don't want
[20:14] to thank you for praying

[20:46] spoke to Abraham
[20:48] the God that was born inside of a Virgin
[20:50] Mary
[20:52] Lord and through that vessel of humanity
[20:55] you would touch leopards and
[20:58] even to the point till you will allow
[21:00] yourself
[21:01] to be beaten and bruised
[21:04] with a cat of nine tails
[21:06] you did that that we could be healed
[21:08] [Music]
[21:10] you were wounded for our transgressions

[44:20] amen God bless you tonight it's it's
[44:23] good to be back in the house of the Lord
[44:24] with you and
[44:26] and we just we're counted the privilege
[44:29] to be back home
[44:30] and it was it was good to be able to go
[44:33] and to be a blessing where we were where
[44:35] we were sent but there's nothing like
[44:37] coming home and we bring we bring Good
[44:40] Tidings and and we bring good news that
[44:43] the Lord still Reigns throughout all the
[44:46] Earth and we just seen we've seen so
[44:49] many mighty things take place and both
[44:52] there and at brother biscal's brother
[44:54] Tom's camp and just seeing the spirit of
[44:56] the Lord begin to operate and move and
[44:58] you just you just knew you were in a
[45:00] very special spot and and uh it's it's
[45:04] one of my favorite places to go because
[45:06] it's it's my birthing grounds and and
[45:08] then just to see how the Lord got in
[45:11] that meeting speaking that meeting with
[45:12] Brother David Mayer and my we just had a
[45:15] wonderful time in the Lord and
[45:17] Supernatural things happened and then
[45:19] last week we came back home and was able
[45:21] to go to uh true word Tabernacles Ohio
[45:24] Youth Camp there and
[45:27] took about I think it was about 20 25 of
[45:30] us that was that was there at that
[45:32] meeting and and the Lord just did some
[45:35] miraculous things and we've seen we've
[45:38] seen the Angel of the Lord operate and
[45:40] began to move and it was just a special
[45:42] time in the Lord and to see your people
[45:45] get blessed and and you know it just
[45:47] means a whole lot to you and I just
[45:50] shared this one instance and it probably
[45:52] never get told or if I don't but we had
[45:56] something kind of well we had a bunch of
[45:58] Supernatural happen but but there was
[46:01] you know if you're standing on one side
[46:03] and you see you know something's going
[46:05] to happen you you just you're just ready
[46:07] for it and you're waiting for it and the
[46:09] Lord had showed me that sister Carly was
[46:10] going to get a blessing in that meeting
[46:12] and brother Adam and sister Carly went
[46:14] with us and I couldn't have made that
[46:16] meeting without brother adamy he took
[46:18] care of me drove me was he was a great
[46:21] Deacon so you got great deacons here and
[46:24] and I just knew that the Lord was going
[46:25] to do something very special for sister
[46:27] Carly just just give me a little
[46:29] something there and
[46:31] you know and and there was a very
[46:33] powerful moment before sister Carly was
[46:35] able to get into the prayer line there
[46:36] on Saturday night and
[46:38] kind of wiped all of my energy out and
[46:40] it was actually brother Ben Erickson's
[46:42] daughter and uh
[46:43] she just got a refill another Holy Ghost
[46:45] over and over again and it just
[46:47] completely wiped all my energy out and
[46:49] brother the brothers pulled me back and
[46:51] and uh she hadn't she kind of went on
[46:55] there and Carly had done went on and she
[46:57] was praying as well Lord I really like
[47:00] to have brother Andrew there you know
[47:01] you you just it means something to you
[47:03] for her side or or for your side when
[47:05] your pastor can pray for you and so and
[47:08] so she was praying those things that
[47:09] could she could see that I wasn't going
[47:11] to be able to make it back in the line
[47:12] and when they when they told it me off
[47:15] and carried me out like a baby I cried
[47:17] on brother Adam and told him I'm sorry
[47:18] and I really wanted to be there for
[47:21] Carly and uh
[47:23] you know means a lot to you
[47:26] but she came back with the reports like
[47:28] Adam said he was he was praying he was I
[47:31] heard him praying I heard him praying
[47:33] and I was nowhere in the vicinity of
[47:34] where she was
[47:36] but God made us a part of something that
[47:39] we couldn't even be a part of in our own
[47:41] self but she heard me praying and I
[47:43] wasn't even there so God God is a
[47:46] supernatural God and you say well how
[47:48] are you going to explain that I don't
[47:50] have to
[47:51] I serve a god
[47:53] that I don't have to explain
[47:56] but I believe him with every fiber of my
[47:59] being
[48:00] whether I'm in the building or not I
[48:03] know that God's got a benefit for his
[48:05] children
[48:07] and he is going to make sure that it
[48:09] comes to pass
[48:10] so that shows that we're serving a very
[48:13] Supernatural God even tonight I was I'll
[48:16] be honest I ain't talked to brother
[48:17] Matthew about the song service but I
[48:19] just back here Lord I'd really like to
[48:22] have sister Gabrielle sing that song I'm
[48:24] cleansed tonight
[48:25] you know God does all things perfectly
[48:28] and and I'd like to share this this more
[48:31] this portion
[48:34] it's real special to me
[48:36] my daughter Reagan received the baptism
[48:38] of the Holy Ghost last week
[48:41] at Ohio
[48:42] [Applause]
[48:44] [Music]
[48:50] that's what you pray for
[48:53] that's what you pray for as a parent
[48:55] [Music]
[48:57] I don't really care what else comes in
[48:58] life that's everything to me it's
[49:01] everything and so we just we just know
[49:04] that we're serving a living God and
[49:06] and uh we just we just want to go to him
[49:08] tonight and know that he's he's been
[49:10] doing great things we heard wonderful
[49:12] things of the past two weekends and I'm
[49:13] sure proud of our pastor seeing what all
[49:16] he stood through the past couple weeks
[49:18] and then brother Matthew and brother
[49:19] William and I just thought that that our
[49:21] brothers did a phenomenal job in the
[49:24] presence of the Lord and I just can't do
[49:26] anything
[49:28] thank you
[49:34] if you have your Bibles this evening
[49:35] would like to like to look over in the
[49:38] New Testament Matthew chapter 28.
[49:41] Matthew chapter 28 and verse 5.
[49:51] chapter 28 and verse 5 and
[49:54] I'd just like to take a little thought
[49:56] here tonight
[49:57] the Lord's been dealing with us on
[50:00] on The Messengers of the Resurrection
[50:03] messengers of the Resurrection amen amen
[50:07] before we before we read tonight maybe
[50:09] we'll just just speak to the author of
[50:11] the word Heavenly Father we come before
[50:13] you tonight Lord realizing where we're
[50:15] standing at lord it's a very special
[50:17] spot
[50:18] Lord and we we brought greetings back
[50:21] from the lands that we were in Father
[50:23] we've seen you move and and just begin
[50:26] to pour out your spirit but father
[50:28] tonight we're in a very special spot
[50:30] here
[50:31] and Lord we realize that you are so
[50:33] Supernatural and you are redeeming
[50:36] Humanity by humanity and father you're
[50:38] wanting to work through the preaching of
[50:40] your word here tonight
[50:42] Lord we as men might have might have
[50:45] been a part of these things we might
[50:46] have set up and known and understood
[50:48] that there's a time that we're going to
[50:49] meet but Lord I believe that we're
[50:51] standing in ordained moments Lord Jesus
[50:54] where you could come and you could touch
[50:56] your vessels of of humanity of Mercy
[50:59] father that you could pour out your
[51:01] spirit father maybe maybe knowledge of
[51:03] maybe knowledge of a scripture father
[51:05] maybe just something Lord Jesus and I
[51:08] pray God tonight that the Living God
[51:10] would would just come amongst us father
[51:12] to begin to express his godhead deity
[51:16] through the body of Jesus Christ father
[51:18] Lord I pray God that there would be
[51:20] Supernatural things here tonight Lord
[51:22] we've we we know that you're very well
[51:25] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[51:29] all that we could ever ask or think
[51:30] father and I know God that you you have
[51:33] us in your mind father so I would invite
[51:36] you now to come and take the pulpit Lord
[51:38] Jesus and begin to minister to your
[51:40] children father upon the knee needs that
[51:43] they have upon their lives I pray that
[51:45] you would answer their questions and may
[51:47] you go into their future father and
[51:50] secure it by the word of the Lord so
[51:53] father we ask God to you and meet the
[51:54] needs tonight and you'd be both speaker
[51:57] and hearer in the name of Jesus Christ
[52:00] amen and amen Matthew chapter 28 and
[52:04] verse 5 and the angel answered and said
[52:07] unto the women fear not ye for I know
[52:11] that you seek Jesus which was crucified
[52:14] he is not here for He Is Risen as he
[52:18] said come see the place where the Lord
[52:21] lay and go quickly and tell his
[52:24] disciples that he has risen from the
[52:25] dead and behold he goeth before you into
[52:28] Galilee
[52:29] there shall you see him lo I have told
[52:33] you and they departed quickly from the
[52:36] Sepulcher with fear and great joy and
[52:38] did run to bring his disciples word and
[52:42] I I love this verse that we've just read
[52:44] here in verse chapter eight it's it's
[52:46] it's such a beautiful verse and it and
[52:48] it contains the description of the
[52:51] mingled passions of of fear and joy and
[52:54] I know that we're living in an hour
[52:56] where we're dealing with a spirit of
[52:58] fear and but and there we're living in
[53:00] an hour where Joy is being taken away
[53:02] from from God's children but I think
[53:04] it's a very powerful scripture that
[53:06] we've read here tonight that we
[53:07] recognize that there is a mingled
[53:10] passion that is amongst these disciples
[53:12] because they're fearful in one sense
[53:14] because their lord is not there they're
[53:17] fearful because they're talking to an
[53:18] Angelic being but yet there's great joy
[53:21] that is that is that is pushing on the
[53:23] inside of them because they recognize
[53:25] that he's not there and they've just
[53:27] heard an Angelic message that has told
[53:29] them him that he is alive and I'm going
[53:32] to he's going to meet you there so so
[53:34] you see you see that but you watch the
[53:37] expression of their faith that was shown
[53:39] by the running here they ran to tell his
[53:43] disciples that he was alive they ran
[53:45] that's the expression of their faith was
[53:47] to spread the message and as they went
[53:51] to tell his disciples behold Jesus met
[53:54] them saying all hell and they came and
[53:57] held him by the feet and worshiped him
[54:00] then said Jesus unto them Be not Afraid
[54:03] go tell my brethren that they go into
[54:07] Galilee and there shall they see me may
[54:10] God bless his word he may be seated in
[54:12] the presence of the Lord as we said we'd
[54:14] like to speak to you on this thought of
[54:16] Messengers messengers of the
[54:19] Resurrection said in the message go tell
[54:22] he said oh there has been great messages
[54:24] he said but Easter capped them all great
[54:27] messages Easter was all of it when the
[54:29] dead was made preparation when that Last
[54:32] Enemy we'd seen sickness healed in the
[54:34] Old Testament we'd seen Miracles
[54:36] performed in the Old Testament and there
[54:38] were Visions come in the Old Testament
[54:40] but every man went right to the Grave
[54:42] wondering would he ever rise again but
[54:45] on Easter morning on Easter morning when
[54:47] the disciples got the greatest message
[54:50] that any man could ever get what did
[54:52] they get go tell my disciples that I am
[54:55] risen from the dead and death had been
[54:58] conquered they had got the greatest
[55:00] message that ever could get got is that
[55:02] the man that had once that had once told
[55:05] that he had power over death Hell In The
[55:08] Grave had now been proven that he was
[55:10] the mighty conqueror now the Bible says
[55:13] here in Hebrews chapter 2 if you want to
[55:15] turn there with us tonight verse 1 it
[55:17] said therefore we ought to give the more
[55:20] Earnest heed to the things which we've
[55:22] heard lest at any time we should let
[55:25] them slip for if the word spoken by
[55:28] Angels was steadfast in every
[55:30] transgression and Disobedience received
[55:32] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[55:36] escape if we neglect so great a
[55:38] Salvation which at first began to be
[55:40] spoken by the Lord and was confirmed
[55:43] unto us by them that heard him God also
[55:46] bearing them witness both with signs and
[55:49] wonders and also with diverse Miracles
[55:52] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost according to
[55:54] his own will and we realize what a
[55:56] messenger is it is one that bears a
[55:59] message or it Bears an air and it is
[56:01] somebody that bears a a verbal
[56:03] communication or it Bears a written
[56:05] communication a messenger is known as a
[56:08] Harbinger or is known as a forerunner or
[56:10] somebody that foreshows something and
[56:13] the Bible tells in Proverbs Chapter 13
[56:15] and 17 that a wicked messenger falleth
[56:18] into Mischief but a faithful Ambassador
[56:21] is health so a wicked messenger falls
[56:24] into Mischief but a faithful Ambassador
[56:26] is hell so in other words in other words
[56:29] a trustworthy and a wise messenger
[56:32] releases healing wherever he goes and
[56:34] ain't it wonderful to know that tonight
[56:36] that wherever we go we don't have to be
[56:38] bearers of bad news but we can be
[56:40] bearers of good news that we can bring
[56:42] healing with our words we can bring
[56:44] healing with our spirit we can bring
[56:46] healing because we are not messengers of
[56:49] messengers of death we are messengers of
[56:51] life and I think it's a wonderful thing
[56:53] tonight to know that we don't have to go
[56:55] around with a with a spirit of
[56:57] complexities of life not trying to
[56:59] figure out which way to go or which way
[57:02] which way is up or which ways down but
[57:03] we know in whom we hath believed and we
[57:06] recognize that there is healing in the
[57:08] words of Jesus Christ now now anybody
[57:11] can carry news
[57:12] if they're right anybody can carry news
[57:14] but the value in the messenger is the
[57:17] message that he carries you know good
[57:20] and well that you've had thoughts about
[57:21] you've had thoughts about your mailman
[57:23] when he dropped off bills that you
[57:25] couldn't pay you had thoughts about him
[57:26] and you see there but he also carries
[57:29] good things in that mail as well he'll
[57:31] he'll bring you checks or he'll bring
[57:32] you good news he'll bring you birthday
[57:34] card say maybe your grandma put some
[57:36] money in there he is the man that drops
[57:38] off he both drops off good news and he
[57:41] drops off bad news and you've heard the
[57:43] mat you've heard the you've heard the
[57:45] statement don't shoot the messenger you
[57:47] see he's not the one to get mad at he's
[57:49] simply the one that brought the message
[57:51] that came from a higher source or from a
[57:53] Depot's or a or a post where he is
[57:56] supposed to send it out to and you know
[57:58] good and well that there are certain
[58:00] people that are here that that are that
[58:02] are here that would rather have maybe a
[58:04] different delivery company that would or
[58:06] a different Pastor or a different
[58:08] preacher that would come and drop off
[58:09] the mail at their house but because
[58:12] there are some sometimes they're maybe
[58:14] maybe natural companies of UPS or FedEx
[58:17] that that are known for a reputation
[58:19] that they've had missed deliveries in
[58:21] their past reputations but you see you
[58:23] can't you can't blame it on you can't
[58:25] blame it on the man it's just what it's
[58:27] just what is laying there and brother
[58:29] Brandon was very clear on those thoughts
[58:31] in question and answers on the seals he
[58:34] would tell us he said that the church is
[58:36] living off of its past reputations he
[58:39] said but not the bride he said the
[58:41] Methodist and the Baptists and all of
[58:43] them they're living off of their past
[58:44] reputations but not the bride he said
[58:46] they're living under that line time back
[58:49] there he said but the bride is not
[58:51] living under that time you see anybody
[58:53] can carry the message anybody can
[58:55] anybody can pack it or anybody can say
[58:57] that they're a message believer but
[58:59] there's got to be somebody that really
[59:01] believes what the message is
[59:04] now you know good and well that brother
[59:06] Byron would tell you brother Brandon
[59:07] would tell you now if a man shows up to
[59:09] your house and he's got a box of
[59:11] rattlesnakes there he said now are you
[59:13] going to sign for that or not it's up to
[59:15] you so if if the Devil comes to you and
[59:18] he offers you sickness what are you
[59:20] going to do for it are you going to sign
[59:21] for it absolutely not because you are
[59:24] not going to sign for something that you
[59:26] know is going to bite you but
[59:28] immediately how Satan comes in he
[59:30] doesn't show you that it's a box of
[59:31] rattlesnakes he simply shows you
[59:34] something with a depressed word upon it
[59:36] or he shows you something that is of a
[59:39] different angle so that you don't
[59:41] capture what it is but if you sign for
[59:43] them boxer rattlesnakes
[59:45] it's on you is that right if you sign up
[59:48] for it if you simply sit there and and
[59:50] you understand that you understand what
[59:52] you're grabbing a hold of
[59:54] if you understand that you're grabbing a
[59:55] hold of a box of rattlesnakes it's on
[59:57] you if you accept it so if Satan tries
[1:00:00] to put on you fear or anxiety and and
[1:00:03] all of these complexes are fear and all
[1:00:05] of these things that are laying there if
[1:00:07] you sign up for that and say Satan I
[1:00:09] want that
[1:00:10] it's now upon you because now you have
[1:00:13] taken it as your personal possession
[1:00:17] is that right you're taking it and
[1:00:19] you're saying that's exactly what I want
[1:00:21] but I believe that we're living in an
[1:00:23] hour where we don't have to settle for
[1:00:25] what the devil is trying to offer us we
[1:00:27] don't have to settle for fear we don't
[1:00:29] have to settle for anxiety we don't have
[1:00:31] to settle for the things that the world
[1:00:33] has to offer us because we realize that
[1:00:36] we are not a people that are living
[1:00:37] under jurisdiction of Satan but we are
[1:00:40] under a different Kingdom
[1:00:42] now you know good and well that God
[1:00:44] never respected Israel on on what they
[1:00:47] had been but he only respected them on
[1:00:50] what they was at that moment that's why
[1:00:53] brother Brandon would tell us that
[1:00:54] you've got to have your own experience
[1:00:56] he said now you can't God does not have
[1:00:59] any grandchildren because you cannot go
[1:01:01] in on your papa or your mama's
[1:01:03] experience but you have to have your own
[1:01:06] experience is that right you have to
[1:01:08] have your own experience let's say it
[1:01:10] together I have to have my own
[1:01:13] experience
[1:01:15] amen why don't you give the Lord a hand
[1:01:17] clap of praise
[1:01:21] Hallelujah I've got to study in this
[1:01:23] thought out and I was looking over some
[1:01:25] things this week and I got I got to
[1:01:27] reading I got to reading about a mailman
[1:01:29] that was that was a part of of World War
[1:01:31] II and what his job was what he what his
[1:01:34] job was to do was to was to pack the
[1:01:37] News That's because he's a mailman but
[1:01:39] he said he began to tell the story about
[1:01:41] about how important his job was he said
[1:01:43] my job was not the job to go out there
[1:01:46] and to fight like the rest of them he
[1:01:48] said but my job was just as important as
[1:01:51] the rest of that he said it could have
[1:01:52] been that he said it was dangerous at
[1:01:54] times he said but he said it was a job
[1:01:56] he said it was a job that was all so
[1:01:58] good because he recognized that his job
[1:02:01] they told him said now look when we hire
[1:02:03] you for this position said you got to be
[1:02:05] the first one off the ship and you got
[1:02:07] to be the last one on because you got to
[1:02:09] be the one that gets the mail to where
[1:02:12] it's destined to go to and what I'm
[1:02:14] trying to say to you tonight is there is
[1:02:16] a destiny that is for you there is a
[1:02:18] destiny for this message and this man
[1:02:20] this man said he said now he said he
[1:02:23] said my job was important he said
[1:02:24] because I was packing the good news I
[1:02:26] was packing the good news from home and
[1:02:28] he he would describe it that it changed
[1:02:30] when he would bring in when he would
[1:02:32] bring in the mail from overseas or from
[1:02:35] the Homeland he said it changed the
[1:02:37] whole morale of the entire company of
[1:02:40] the harmony of the army that was there
[1:02:42] he said Bill he said I would watch me
[1:02:44] and they would take that envelope they
[1:02:46] would smell it because they would smell
[1:02:47] the community of Homeland they would
[1:02:49] look in there and they would see that
[1:02:51] familiar handwriting and you could watch
[1:02:53] how that the scripture or or excuse me
[1:02:55] or how the word or how the word that was
[1:02:58] sitting that was in that message it had
[1:03:00] brought and changed the morale it
[1:03:02] changed everything about them because
[1:03:04] what did it do it took them to a place
[1:03:06] from where they hadn't been for so long
[1:03:09] when they were there on that foreign
[1:03:11] land and they were fighting over there
[1:03:12] but a moment in time just reading a
[1:03:15] little bitty letter from home it changed
[1:03:17] the entire morale of the fight that they
[1:03:19] were in and you know good and well what
[1:03:21] it's like for you when you get in the
[1:03:23] midst of a battle and all of a sudden
[1:03:25] and you you remember that you've got
[1:03:27] some mail that maybe you ain't opened up
[1:03:29] in a while and you begin to open it up
[1:03:31] and you begin to look over there and it
[1:03:33] changes your home morale because you
[1:03:35] remember even though I am in a battle
[1:03:37] even though I am in laodicea even though
[1:03:39] I am in a condition even though I am in
[1:03:42] this chaos of life but there is a letter
[1:03:45] that I can open and if I could ever
[1:03:47] encourage you tonight to open up the
[1:03:49] message to open up the scriptures and
[1:03:51] look over there in Psalms 103 that he
[1:03:54] has not dealt with us after our sins nor
[1:03:57] rewarded us according to our iniquities
[1:03:59] for as high as the heaven is high above
[1:04:02] the Earth so great is his Mercy towards
[1:04:04] them that fear him as far as the East is
[1:04:07] from the West so far has he removed our
[1:04:10] transgressions from us ain't it
[1:04:13] wonderful to know that no matter how far
[1:04:15] you get and no matter what battle you
[1:04:17] get yourself into that there's some mail
[1:04:19] that you can open up when a witchcraft
[1:04:22] Spirit comes against you when the enemy
[1:04:24] comes in against you like a flood you
[1:04:26] can lift up the scriptures look into the
[1:04:28] mailbag and say it's got my name on it
[1:04:31] it's got my name on it ain't just for
[1:04:34] this one it ain't just for Paul it ain't
[1:04:35] just for David it's for me
[1:04:39] that's why David would say in Psalms 18
[1:04:41] I will love the Lord my strength the
[1:04:44] Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my
[1:04:47] deliverer my God my strength in him will
[1:04:49] I trust my buckler the Horn of my
[1:04:51] salvation my high tower I will call upon
[1:04:55] the Lord who is worthy to be praised so
[1:04:58] shall I be saved from my enemies the
[1:05:01] Sorrows of floods and of ungodly men
[1:05:03] made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell
[1:05:05] Compass me about the snares of death
[1:05:08] prevented me but in my distress I opened
[1:05:12] up this letter
[1:05:13] him out of stress in my distress when I
[1:05:17] was in Warfare when I was in trouble
[1:05:19] when I was in sin when I was in sickness
[1:05:21] Hallelujah I open up the mail I called
[1:05:25] upon the Lord and Cried unto my God and
[1:05:28] he heard my voice out of his Temple and
[1:05:31] My Cry came before him even unto his
[1:05:34] ears ain't it wonderful to know that
[1:05:36] even though you get in the midst of the
[1:05:38] Valley of the shadow of death that there
[1:05:40] is a letter that is there for you that
[1:05:42] God's anointed you that his rod and his
[1:05:45] staff is for you
[1:05:47] let me what am I trying to tell you if
[1:05:49] you can just grab a hold of the mail
[1:05:50] it'll change your morale
[1:05:54] you know good and well if you got the
[1:05:56] right mental attitude it'll bring the
[1:05:57] word of God to pass is that right and
[1:06:00] that's what brother random said about
[1:06:01] Hattie Wright she had the right attitude
[1:06:03] she wasn't sitting out there why why
[1:06:05] didn't God choose me to speak the
[1:06:07] squirrels into existence why I wasn't
[1:06:09] there and I hunting that party but she
[1:06:11] simply was sitting there with the right
[1:06:13] attitude just like the woman that was a
[1:06:15] tyronesian woman that had sent there and
[1:06:18] said Lord my daughter is grievally vexed
[1:06:20] with the devil she said how can I Jesus
[1:06:23] said how can I turn around and give
[1:06:25] God's bread God's children bed over to
[1:06:27] you dogs she said yeah it's true Lord
[1:06:30] what did she do she had the right
[1:06:32] attitude
[1:06:33] she had the right attitude about it and
[1:06:36] what did he do he said oh your faith has
[1:06:38] made you whole if you can get the right
[1:06:40] attitude about it even though you might
[1:06:42] be in the valley even though you might
[1:06:44] be in pain you might had a bad diagnosis
[1:06:46] you might have had a bad weekend for you
[1:06:48] with your boss you might have had a bad
[1:06:50] argument with your wife
[1:06:51] [Music]

[1:08:29] last time you picked up God's mail
[1:08:32] come on somebody just go to the mailbox
[1:08:34] open it up and find out he's a God
[1:08:37] that's rich in Mercy he's a God That
[1:08:39] Forgives he said God that heals he's a
[1:08:42] God that delivers he's a God that sets
[1:08:44] free
[1:08:46] well you say I'm in bondage brother
[1:08:48] Andrew open up the Bible and find out
[1:08:51] he's a God that loses you from bondage
[1:08:59] what did this male do
[1:09:01] it took these men
[1:09:03] from a miserable spot
[1:09:06] to a place of hope
[1:09:09] what if I just told you that these
[1:09:11] scriptures are powerful enough to change
[1:09:14] your spiritual altitude
[1:09:17] you see what you have received in this
[1:09:19] generation is not a message of disgrace
[1:09:21] but it is a message of Grace
[1:09:24] but you see the one that is entrusted to
[1:09:26] run with a message it shows the Faith
[1:09:30] from the one who gave the message
[1:09:34] if he chose you to run with this message
[1:09:36] he's got something on the inside of you
[1:09:38] that you know that'll unlock the gate
[1:09:41] when you get there
[1:09:42] because you're not a people that have
[1:09:44] forgot his sayings
[1:09:46] you're not a people that has run this
[1:09:48] race and forgot the key you are a people
[1:09:51] and God if God has chosen you is shows
[1:09:55] that God trusts you to carry out the
[1:09:57] message
[1:09:59] I don't need men's Applause I don't need
[1:10:02] somebody else to Pat me on my back I
[1:10:05] don't need I I think it's wonderful to
[1:10:06] have a companion or have a friend there
[1:10:08] with you but when you're all alone if
[1:10:11] God is the one that chose me it didn't
[1:10:14] matter where John the Baptist when he
[1:10:16] knew that he was getting ready to get
[1:10:17] his head cut off because he preached the
[1:10:19] message God had entrusted him to deliver
[1:10:22] the mail and the Bible had said amongst
[1:10:25] women there was nobody that was greater
[1:10:27] than John but Jesus said that he that is
[1:10:30] least in the kingdom of God is greater
[1:10:32] than he
[1:10:34] but God had chose John for a specific
[1:10:37] purpose whoa no notice where did God
[1:10:41] meet this Forerunner at he met him in
[1:10:44] the water at the Jordan River notice
[1:10:47] where the lamb came and met the prophet
[1:10:50] in this hour the word met the prophet in
[1:10:53] 1933 in the waters on the Ohio River and
[1:10:57] said as John the Baptist 4run my first
[1:10:59] coming so will your message William
[1:11:02] Branham forerun the second coming of
[1:11:04] Christ now you know that that happened
[1:11:07] not just one time but it happened over
[1:11:09] and over and over again
[1:11:11] that were meeting after meeting where
[1:11:13] men would raise up and say as John the
[1:11:16] Baptist was sent so is William Branham
[1:11:18] sent one time there was in a cathedral
[1:11:20] in San Antonio where where William
[1:11:22] Branham was preaching brother Bynum said
[1:11:24] that there was a little boy back there a
[1:11:25] little fella back there
[1:11:28] God will take anybody and use him to
[1:11:30] speak he said there's a little fella
[1:11:32] back there he said he got to speaking in
[1:11:34] tongues he said that at such a rapid
[1:11:36] speed he said it was like a machine gun
[1:11:38] going off and he said all of a sudden he
[1:11:40] said there was another fellow that rose
[1:11:41] up right there and said thus saith the
[1:11:44] Lord that man that's walking to the
[1:11:46] platform is going forward with a
[1:11:48] Ministry that is ordained of almighty
[1:11:50] God as John the Baptist was sent as a
[1:11:52] first Forerunner of the coming of Christ
[1:11:54] so this man packs a message that will
[1:11:57] cause the second coming of our Lord
[1:11:59] Jesus Christ now what am I saying to you
[1:12:02] I'm saying to you you've already got a
[1:12:04] message
[1:12:05] the mail's already been delivered
[1:12:09] so what are you looking for I'm looking
[1:12:11] for the second coming this message has
[1:12:14] this message has interrupted all of
[1:12:17] Heather Hale's plans this message has
[1:12:20] upset Satan this message has discharged
[1:12:23] Satan and told him he's nothing but a
[1:12:25] bluff
[1:12:26] foreign
[1:12:30] of Jesus Christ
[1:12:34] my grandmother Clara Spencer before she
[1:12:36] ever knew anything about a Last Day
[1:12:39] message the Lord had shown her the Lord
[1:12:42] deal has dealt with a Spencer family
[1:12:43] through visions and the Lord showed my
[1:12:46] great-grandmother Clara Spencer William
[1:12:48] Branham was the man that was going to
[1:12:51] fulfill Malachi 4.
[1:12:54] he showed her this before she ever heard
[1:12:57] the name of William Branham
[1:12:59] but when my papa Charlie Spencer grabbed
[1:13:02] the message he grabbed a hold of them
[1:13:05] only Believe Books you remember of the
[1:13:07] in the first message he got was the way
[1:13:10] of a true Prophet you go to studying
[1:13:12] that out you'll find that brother
[1:13:13] Branham identifies that as the as the
[1:13:17] trail of the Prophet that's what he
[1:13:19] calls it the trail of the Prophet now
[1:13:21] notice this woman my great-grandmother
[1:13:24] was on that trail before God had ever
[1:13:27] seen before she ever seen William
[1:13:29] Branham and when my papa Charlie had
[1:13:31] brought a trail of the Prophet had
[1:13:34] brought it to her and he said I believe
[1:13:36] this is the message of the hour when she
[1:13:40] opened up the book there was a picture
[1:13:42] of William Branham said that's Elijah
[1:13:47] but for 20 years before it ever seen
[1:13:50] there was a woman that was on the trail
[1:13:53] what am I saying to you that you are a
[1:13:55] people that are on the trail of a
[1:13:57] prophet
[1:13:58] what am I saying to you I'm saying it'll
[1:14:01] lead you right to the second coming of
[1:14:02] almighty God
[1:14:04] you don't have to create a new wheel the
[1:14:07] message is already came you ain't got to
[1:14:09] have a new thought all you got to do is
[1:14:11] pack the message brother that's all you
[1:14:13] got to do young people you ain't got to
[1:14:15] work yourself up you ain't got to get
[1:14:17] emotional and say oh I gotta dance like
[1:14:18] this one I gotta shout like that one
[1:14:20] just peek pick up the message and run
[1:14:23] with it and when you pick up the message
[1:14:25] I guarantee you it'll make you emotional
[1:14:30] pick it up one time well I don't know
[1:14:32] about all that emotion and all that
[1:14:33] dance and all that shout pick up the
[1:14:35] message one time
[1:14:36] just pick it up one time let me tell you
[1:14:39] I was one way but when I got on this
[1:14:41] Trail
[1:14:43] I was one way but when I got on this
[1:14:45] Trail don't Rick try to recreate the
[1:14:48] wheel pack the message brother
[1:14:50] that's why William Burnham say just say
[1:14:53] what the tape say
[1:14:55] [Applause]
[1:14:57] because if you start taking away from it
[1:15:00] what are you doing you're robbing the
[1:15:01] authority of the word that is there
[1:15:03] that's why Jesus would say in the in
[1:15:07] Genesis in the middle of the book and in
[1:15:09] Revelations he that adds or takes away
[1:15:11] his part will be taken away from him out
[1:15:14] of the book of eternal life what is it
[1:15:16] if you take away from the message if you
[1:15:19] try to add to the message you are
[1:15:21] robbing the authority
[1:15:23] you're robbing the authority of the word
[1:15:25] all you've got to do
[1:15:29] Lord I believe it
[1:15:33] explain it to me all brother Andrew I
[1:15:36] won't work that way
[1:15:37] because if you can explain it somebody
[1:15:40] can explain it away from you but if you
[1:15:42] believe it against hell and high waters
[1:15:44] you can stand there against cancer you
[1:15:46] can stand there against sugar diabetes
[1:15:48] you can stand there against gout you can
[1:15:50] stand there against depression you can
[1:15:51] stand there against criticism and you're
[1:15:53] going to make it what am I saying to you
[1:15:55] simply stay with a message
[1:15:58] run this message that's why William
[1:16:00] Brandon I love this my brother Brandon

[1:19:39] Ghost and God will back it up
[1:19:43] you take the word you're a messenger
[1:19:49] so what I'm saying to you is that what
[1:19:51] you're carrying is not a dead letter
[1:19:53] it's a Living Word
[1:19:55] notice what brother random does here in
[1:19:58] the Hebrew series he said now we we
[1:20:00] ought to give the more Earnest heed lest
[1:20:02] at any time we let them slip for if the
[1:20:04] word spoken by angels will steadfast he
[1:20:07] said you hear it he said if the word
[1:20:09] spoken by angels He said an angel is a
[1:20:11] messenger the word angel means messenger
[1:20:14] and just got he said now notice what he
[1:20:16] does he goes back to Hebrews chapter 1
[1:20:18] and said God who in sun-dried times and
[1:20:20] in diverse manners spoke to the fathers
[1:20:23] by the prophets he said that was God's
[1:20:25] Messengers
[1:20:27] that was God's Messengers and they was
[1:20:29] God's Messengers and they were God's
[1:20:31] angels a messenger is an angel an angel
[1:20:35] or an angel is a messenger so where are
[1:20:37] we living at we are living in the hour
[1:20:39] of restoration you know where you're
[1:20:42] living at it's Joel chapter 2 perfectly
[1:20:44] positioning the body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:46] that the canker worm the Palmer worm and
[1:20:49] the same worm that ate down all the
[1:20:51] power of the Church of the Living God
[1:20:53] has now returned to the church so now
[1:20:56] we're living in the hour of the
[1:20:59] restoration of the prophecy that is in
[1:21:01] the Church of the Living God and I know
[1:21:03] with that it scares Satan really bad
[1:21:05] when there's prophecy that comes forth
[1:21:07] from the Church of the Living God you
[1:21:09] watch immediately if there's a tongue in
[1:21:11] their interpretation then it becomes
[1:21:13] prophecy that's when Satan gets real
[1:21:15] scared right there because it's now it's
[1:21:18] not just something that we're looking
[1:21:19] back for or we're looking back but now
[1:21:22] we have come into the hour of
[1:21:24] restoration
[1:21:25] now don't let that scare you don't let
[1:21:27] that scare you because the Bible tells
[1:21:29] us that the testimony of Jesus Christ is
[1:21:32] the spirit of Prophecy so when you see
[1:21:34] prophecy coming you are watching the
[1:21:37] testimony of Jesus Christ I know exactly
[1:21:39] what I'm talking about a couple weeks
[1:21:41] ago while I was up here in Canada
[1:21:42] Cloverdale Bible way I was just
[1:21:44] breaching away and all of a sudden out
[1:21:46] of my mouth said come out of these words
[1:21:48] said today you're going to see a miracle
[1:21:50] or God's not God now you know what I did
[1:21:52] here in humanity I wanted to throw my
[1:21:54] hands over my mouth say what did I just
[1:21:56] say but I wasn't the one that said that
[1:21:59] it was the spirit of Prophecy that was
[1:22:02] working in the body of Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] these are things that have been returned
[1:22:06] to the Church of the Living God now
[1:22:09] don't let that scare you don't let it
[1:22:10] and it did you can feel it all of a
[1:22:13] sudden the whole building began to tense
[1:22:14] up but what did do we watch God back up
[1:22:17] his word miracle after Miracle after
[1:22:20] Miracle after Miracle took place so what
[1:22:23] is it it's the testimony faith of Jesus
[1:22:26] Christ when you see prophecy coming back
[1:22:29] to the Church of the Living God who said
[1:22:31] well I don't know about all this but a
[1:22:32] new testament Prophet is a preacher
[1:22:35] so you could take brother William put
[1:22:37] him behind this Pulpit you can take
[1:22:39] brother Matthew put him behind this
[1:22:41] Pulpit what is it a new testament
[1:22:43] Prophet is a breacher and when you're
[1:22:45] standing there these brothers take the
[1:22:48] word of the Living God for this hour put
[1:22:50] it on their lips transfer it to you it's
[1:22:53] prophecy
[1:22:56] what is Satan so scared about is that we
[1:22:59] as a Church of the Living God go up
[1:23:01] there and take our gifts off of the
[1:23:03] shelf and put them to action
[1:23:07] what I'm not talking to you that you're
[1:23:09] messengers of death your messengers of
[1:23:11] the Resurrection everything that my
[1:23:14] father has for you
[1:23:16] if it's too high get a ladder climb up
[1:23:18] there and get your joy back climb a burn
[1:23:20] get your dance back
[1:23:24] or to have mercy I wish I had the tongue
[1:23:26] of Ten Thousand Angels I'd preach to you
[1:23:28] I'd sing to you and I'd shout to you
[1:23:30] but Jesus said that you would receive
[1:23:33] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:23:36] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[1:23:39] what is it you are a living messenger of
[1:23:43] the Resurrection
[1:23:46] he said you are a messenger this morning
[1:23:49] you a messenger of good news or bad news
[1:23:53] oh isn't it beautiful to know that we're
[1:23:56] ambassadors that we are angels and
[1:23:57] messengers of the resurrection and we
[1:24:00] are God's Messengers to a sinful world
[1:24:02] that Christ lives in our hearts he lives
[1:24:04] in our Spirits he lives and he brings us
[1:24:06] from this low-debot's life of sin and
[1:24:09] exalts us up and gives us a Hallelujah
[1:24:11] in our soul and makes us new creatures
[1:24:13] we are messengers angels of the Covenant
[1:24:18] our glory be to God I don't know I don't
[1:24:21] know what it's doing to you up there
[1:24:22] back to everybody I know what it's doing
[1:24:23] to me in a couple weeks I'm going to
[1:24:25] preach to you a subject on a reason to
[1:24:27] rejoice and if you have heard me real
[1:24:29] loud and clear you've got a reason to
[1:24:32] Rejoice you are not a messenger of death
[1:24:35] you're a messenger of the Resurrection I
[1:24:38] say it like old buddy Robinson Lord give
[1:24:41] me a backbone like a solo and the
[1:24:44] courage to step up and be a witness
[1:24:47] well the world don't want to receive it
[1:24:49] who cares preach the message
[1:24:52] well Satan's against me who cares give
[1:24:55] the good news you're a messenger deliver
[1:24:57] the mail
[1:25:02] you can have the same mixed passions
[1:25:05] fear and joy all at the same time you
[1:25:08] can have it all together but the word of
[1:25:10] the Living God was steadfast in Moses
[1:25:12] the word of the Living God was steadfast
[1:25:14] in Elijah the word of the Living God was
[1:25:16] steadfast in Jesus and it'll be
[1:25:18] steadfast in the Church of the Living
[1:25:20] God and if you are anointed by the holy
[1:25:22] ghost that you are God's messenger
[1:25:25] brother random said if you can receive
[1:25:27] it you can have it a pardon is not a
[1:25:30] pardon unless you receive it as a pardon
[1:25:31] and this message is not your message
[1:25:33] unless you receive it as your message
[1:25:35] but if you receive it if you can receive
[1:25:38] it you can have it what did that woman
[1:25:40] do that was dealing with that blood
[1:25:42] issue she had something in her mind that
[1:25:45] she could receive her healing from that
[1:25:47] man she didn't need to grab a hold of
[1:25:48] his leg she didn't need to grab a hold
[1:25:50] of his head all she had to do was touch

[1:33:45] [Applause]
[1:33:57] I know where I'm standing at I know what
[1:33:59] I'm talking about
[1:34:01] it's for you it's for you what was the
[1:34:04] whole Bible coming for to express what
[1:34:07] God had in his entire mind the whole
[1:34:10] Bible all of these money orders all of
[1:34:13] these love letters have been there and
[1:34:15] it's only an expression of what God had
[1:34:17] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:34:19] world that he would have the preeminence
[1:34:21] in a body and you might have skepticism
[1:34:24] come you might have criticism come
[1:34:26] because you're trying to grab a hold of
[1:34:28] it by faith and say Lord I believe you
[1:34:30] Lord I accept you and skepticism may
[1:34:32] come but Noah didn't care about the
[1:34:34] criticism he didn't care about the
[1:34:36] skepticism he simply took what God Said
[1:34:39] in his word and he had faith in what he
[1:34:41] said and what was Noah doing he was
[1:34:43] expressing his faith by taking God at
[1:34:46] his word what was Abraham doing up there
[1:34:48] when he met Abraham where he met Elohim
[1:34:50] a prayer and he told him that he was
[1:34:52] going to bring for the son and when it
[1:34:54] looked like everything Against All Odds
[1:34:56] Abraham still believed in hope when
[1:34:59] there was no hope to be given except 75
[1:35:01] years old he still believed that God was
[1:35:04] a god they would give him a baby at 90
[1:35:06] years old he still believed that God was
[1:35:09] the kind of God that he would give him a
[1:35:11] baby and in 95 he still believed he
[1:35:14] still Remembered at 98 he still
[1:35:16] Remembered at 99 he still remembered but
[1:35:19] when he turned 100 years old
[1:35:22] when it come time for the Turning of the
[1:35:24] century and the message of el shadiyah
[1:35:26] had showed up
[1:35:29] what was it Abraham was simply
[1:35:32] expressing the faith that he had
[1:35:35] and he was making ready for the baby the
[1:35:38] whole time
[1:35:40] well brother Andrew what are you talking
[1:35:41] about I don't really want a baby but you
[1:35:43] really want a miracle don't you you got
[1:35:45] to make ready before it before you see
[1:35:48] the expression of it and your faith is
[1:35:50] simply you are expressing your works or
[1:35:54] expressing your faith
[1:36:05] you have it
[1:36:07] I've asked for my mom a long time
[1:36:09] brother Andrew you can have it
[1:36:12] I've asked for my healing for quite a
[1:36:13] long time you can have it
[1:36:16] I've asked for my daughter for a long
[1:36:18] time you can have it

[1:36:48] didn't put something on you on the
[1:36:49] inside of you that was a halfway kind of
[1:36:51] a belief God put something on the inside
[1:36:53] that was a genuine seed
[1:36:58] cover up what you got
[1:37:00] with what the world's trying to hold for
[1:37:02] you
