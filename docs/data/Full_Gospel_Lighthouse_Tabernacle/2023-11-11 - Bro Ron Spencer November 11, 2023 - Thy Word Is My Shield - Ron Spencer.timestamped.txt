[49:02] when his words go across our
[49:07] lips they're are not the they're not the
[49:10] words of the
[49:11] president they're not the words of some
[49:14] great poet they're the words of God and
[49:17] the words of God create an atmosphere
[49:19] and create they actually create
[49:22] something in our lives character inside
[49:25] of our Liv lives notice the scripture
[49:27] and there's going to be a lot of
[49:28] scriptures tonight Isaiah 40: 29 he
[49:32] giveth power to the
[49:35] faint and to them that have no might he
[49:38] increases strength even so the youth
[49:41] that shall faint and be weary and the
[49:43] young men shall utterly fall but they
[49:46] that wait upon the
[49:48] Lord shall renew their strength they
[49:51] shall Mount up on wings as an eagle they
[49:54] shall run and not not be weary they

[50:00] faint brother Ram talks to us about that
[50:04] realm of of Heaven he said it'll take
[50:07] perfect love to get there well you must
[50:10] remember this is the place where we
[50:12] develop that kind of a
[50:14] character first in John Chapter 13 and
[50:17] verse
[50:18] 34 a new commandment I give to you that
[50:22] you love one another
[50:26] as I have loved you that ye also love
[50:31] one another John 13 and verse
[50:34] 35 by this all men know that ye are my
[50:41] disciples if you have love one to
[50:46] another 15 and 12 this is my commandment
[50:50] that you love one another as I have
[50:53] loved you 15 and 17
[50:56] these things I command you that you love
[50:58] one another notice the thing Romans 12
[51:01] and verse 10 be kindly affection one to
[51:06] another with Brotherly Love in honor
[51:10] preferring one another Romans 13 and8
[51:15] owe no man anything but to love one
[51:19] another for he that loveth another hath
[51:23] fulfilled the law Galatians chap chap 5
[51:26] and verse 13 for Brethren you have not
[51:29] you have been called unto Liberty which
[51:31] is freedom only use not Liberty for an
[51:36] occasion to the flesh but by love serve
[51:40] one another hundreds of scriptures I
[51:42] could have read to you but you get the
[51:45] them if you can't love one
[51:48] another you can't go to

[1:03:20] four-wheeler he had died in the accident
[1:03:23] Wayne lost prayed for him and he came
[1:03:26] back to life and when they when they
[1:03:29] examined brother Ken they found a a huge
[1:03:33] tumor in his
[1:03:34] brain he took the choice of not having
[1:03:37] any I'm not I'm not arguing with his
[1:03:39] choice he took the choice of not doing
[1:03:41] chemo or not doing anything to to get
[1:03:43] rid of
[1:03:44] it and I I talked to him literally just
[1:03:47] a few weeks before he
[1:03:49] died and he told me how Victorious he
[1:03:52] was and how good that he felt
[1:03:56] he was a testimony in that
[1:03:58] area but he said I refuse to give the
[1:04:02] enemy

[1:11:08] else now there's many great leaders that
[1:11:10] have come and gone that would not allow
[1:11:14] themselves to be molded by the hand of
[1:11:19] God there was a basketball coach that
[1:11:21] just died this week and I'm going to use
[1:11:26] it he died this week and he's reaping
[1:11:28] his reward whatever it was he was uh he
[1:11:32] was a champion he was a champion
[1:11:35] basketball coach he he coached a perfect
[1:11:38] team he he coached them to be totally
[1:11:41] undefeated he coached Mike
[1:11:44] Shashi who was the all-time great he he
[1:11:48] had a lot of people that played for him
[1:11:50] but he said I did it my way that was
[1:11:52] constantly his thing I did it my way now
[1:11:55] he may have been a phenomenal coach on
[1:12:00] but he was not a man that would allow
[1:12:02] himself to be developed in his
[1:12:09] character are you with
[1:12:11] me are you with me he threw chairs he
[1:12:15] choked men he grabbed them he rled him
[1:12:18] he cussed a lot of people come
[1:12:22] on
[1:12:24] as a matter of fact he said many
[1:12:27] disparaging things to many people you
[1:12:31] want that to be on your record and make
[1:12:33] god
[1:12:34] with well brother Ron you're picking on
[1:12:36] a basketball coach well let's talk about
[1:12:40] Napoleon brother man said he conquered
[1:12:42] the
[1:12:44] world he conquered the world but he
[1:12:46] couldn't overcome
[1:12:48] himself
[1:12:51] right so don't don't conquer the world
[1:12:55] and can't overcome
[1:12:57] yourself one of the most famous
[1:12:59] preachers that ever lived was a man
[1:13:01] named Billy Sunday had become a
[1:13:03] professional baseball player then he got
[1:13:05] saved and when he got saved he became a
[1:13:08] preacher and he was a phenomenal
[1:13:11] preacher you hear even brother brand

[1:13:14] of famous preachers at the turn the
[1:13:16] century talk about how great a man that

[1:13:27] but my children went to
[1:13:29] hell on Amen I don't want

[1:16:06] of who I would clean their chimneys
[1:16:10] for is this already to be a little bit
[1:16:12] different
[1:16:14] tonight I walk
[1:16:17] in gu's tattooed
[1:16:20] up he's a big man
[1:16:24] a matter of fact he's a huge
[1:16:27] man he's got his Harley Mama there with
[1:16:29] him
[1:16:31] and and I I couldn't move his stove it
[1:16:34] was too big I was trying to get it back
[1:16:36] in place
[1:16:39] and I I was doing my best and I finally
[1:16:43] decided I couldn't do
[1:16:45] it so I called him by name and I I
[1:16:48] called him in there and he
[1:16:50] said most people are scared of me and I
[1:16:53] I said oh I used to be scared of people
[1:16:55] like you
[1:16:57] too he said what do you mean by that I
[1:16:59] said I met
[1:17:00] Jesus and then I found out people like
[1:17:02] you need love that's right and I looked
[1:17:06] across and I was literally just a couple
[1:17:08] feet from him and I saw tears going down
[1:17:10] through his
[1:17:11] face he said last night I was laying in
[1:17:14] bed and he said I I told my girlfriend
[1:17:16] he said you know I'd like to go to

[1:18:11] Ghost will lead him to the
[1:18:13] message but I want people to be as good
[1:18:17] as I can help them to
[1:18:21] be it's not up to me to judge them it's
[1:18:25] up to God to place
